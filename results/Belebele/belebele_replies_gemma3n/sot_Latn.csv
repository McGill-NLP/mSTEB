"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka thusang ho tiisa bohlokwa ba boiketlo ba diphoofolo ho basebetsi ba hlabang diphoofolo ba Australia?","The correct answer is **A: Ho kenya dikhamera tsa CCTV**.

The passage explicitly states that the Animal Welfare League of NSW, the Animal Liberation, and the RSPCA are advocating for the installation of CCTV cameras in all animal facilities in Australia.  The quote from David O'Shannessy directly links CCTV to ensuring animal welfare.

Therefore, installing CCTV cameras is the action advocated for to improve the welfare of animals in Australia.

"Ho latela seratswana, mosebetsi wa motho ya neng a tshwerwe ke ofe?","The correct answer is **A: Moithuti (Student)**.

The text states: ""Le ha ho le jwalo, mohlodi ya nang le tsebo ya patlisiso o boleletse Naledi ya Lekgotla ya Minneapolis hore e ne e le Louis Jourdain, mora ya dilemo di 16 wa Modula-setulo wa Merabe ya Letsha le Lekgubedu Floyd Jourdain."" This indicates that Louis Jourdain was a student.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ha ditaba di ntse di hasana ka ho tshwarwa hape, ho ne ho ntse ho etswa mapato a batho ba bakae?","The correct answer is **C: A robong**.

The text states: ""...ho ba robong tsa hore moithuti e mong o ile a tshwarwa mabapi le ho thunyana sekolong ka la 21 Hlakubele."" which translates to ""...among the victims that a student was shot in the school on March 21st."" The word ""robong"" means ""victims"" and the text specifies there were six of them.
"
"Ho arabela boipelaetso, ke naha efe e sa kang ya tswela pele ka tumellano ya bona ya ACTA e saennweng?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kgweki e fetileng, ho ne ho e na le diteraeke tse kgolo Poland ha naha eo e saena ACTA, ho bakileng hore mmuso wa Mapolishe o nke qeto ya ho se amohele tumellano, ha jwale."" (Last week, there were large protests in Poland against ACTA, leading the Polish government to decide not to accept the agreement, currently.)
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho dinaha tse latelang e nkileng qeto ya ho tjhetjhisa mokhwa wa ho kenela ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The text states: ""Latvia le Slovakia ka bobedi di diehisitse tshebetso ya ho kenela ACTA."" This means Latvia refused to implement ACTA.
"
Ke batho ba bakae ba ileng ba tswa dikotsi ka lebaka la diketsahalo tsa ho tjhesa ka ho feteletseng ha iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""...sa siya batho ba bane ba na le dikotsi tsa ho tjha tse nyane.""  This translates to ""...left four people with a slight risk of burns."" Therefore, only four people were at risk of burns.
"
Ke mang ya boletseng hore diketsahalo tsa ho tjhesa ka ho feteletseng di ne di se kotsi haholo?,"The correct answer is **A: METI**.

The text states: ""Lefapha la Moruo, Kgwebo le Indasteri (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)) le itse le ne le lemohile ka dikotsi tse 27 tse amanang le disebediswa.""  This directly translates to ""The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) was aware of 27 risks associated with the products.""  Later, it further emphasizes METI's stance by calling Apple's explanation ""llegitimate"".
"
"Nakong ya puo ya hae, Steve Jobs o itse Apple e tla tsosolosa eng?","The correct answer is **B: Mohala (Phone)**.

The passage states: ""Kajeno Apple e tla hlahisa botjha founu ena..."" which translates to ""Today Apple will launch a new phone...""
"
Sepheo sa puo ya Steve Jobs ya dihora tse pedi e ne e le eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho qala fono e ntjha (To launch a new phone)**.

The quote ""Kajeno Apple e tla hlahisa botjha founu ena, Re tlo etsa pale kajeno"" translates to ""Today Apple will launch a new phone, We will make a presentation today.""  The context of Steve Jobs and Apple's history strongly suggests he was referring to a new iPhone launch.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o phatlaladitse eng ho Sebakeng sa Theatre sa Argentina?,"The correct answer is **A: Bokgethwa ba hae ba mopresidente (His presidential candidacy)**.

The passage states: ""Mof. Kirchner o phatlaladitse maikemisetso a hae a ho iketela bopresidente a le mane Argentine Theatre..."" which translates to ""Ms. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine Theatre..."" 

Therefore, she announced her presidential candidacy.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o phatlaladitse morero wa hae wa ho matha hokae?,"The correct answer is **A: Sebakeng sa diketsahalo se bohole ba dimaele tse 31 ho tloha La Plata**.

The text states: ""Mosenate wa hajwale ebile e le Mofumahadi wa Mopresidente wa Argentina Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o phatlaladitse hore e tla ba nkgetheng bakeng sa bopresidente phirimaneng ya maobane mane La Plata, e leng toropokgolo e bohole ba dikhilomitara tse 50 (dimmaele tse 31) ho tloha Buenos Aires.""  This directly translates to saying she announced her candidacy in La Plata, which is 31 miles from Buenos Aires.
"
Diphuputso tsa ACMA mabapi le Big Brother e bile dife?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho fumanwe hore ditaba di ne di dula ho seva.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Molao wa Ditshebeletso tsa Kgaso o fana ka molawana bakeng sa taolo ya dikateng tsa Inthanete, leha ho le jwalo ho nkuwa e le dikateng tsa inthanete, o tlameha ho dula ho seva e le ka nnete.""  This translates to ""The Broadcasting Services Act provides a mechanism for regulating online content, however, even when taken as online content, it must reside on a server in reality.""  

This means ACMA's investigations revealed that the content wasn't just being hosted on the Big Brother website, but actually stored on a server.  The other options are incorrect based on the passage.
"
Metjha ya ditaba e tlameha ho wela tlasa maemo afe e le hore e nkwe e le ditaba tsa inthanete?,"The correct answer is **B: E tlameha ho dula ho seva (It must reside on a server)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Molao wa Ditshebeletso tsa Kgaso o fana ka molawana bakeng sa taolo ya dikateng tsa Inthanete, leha ho le jwalo ho nkuwa e le dikateng tsa inthanete, o tlameha ho dula ho seva e le ka nnete.""  This translates to: ""The Broadcasting Services Act provides a framework for the regulation of online content, however, to be considered online content, it must reside on a server.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E tlameha ho phatlalatswa inthaneteng (It must be published online):** While publication is necessary, it's not sufficient. The content also needs to reside on a server.
*   **C: E ke ke ya bolokwa webosaeteng (It must not be stored on a website):** This is the opposite of what the text says. Content *must* be stored on a website (a server) to be considered online content.
*   **D: E tlameha ho amohelwa ke ACMA (It must be approved by ACMA):**  The passage doesn't state that ACMA approval is a requirement for something to be considered online content. ACMA regulates online content, but approval isn't explicitly mentioned as a necessary step for it to *be* online content.



"
Moetapele oa Liberal Party ya Australia ke mang?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text explicitly states: ""Peter Costello...o monna ya lebeletsweng haholo hore o tla hlahlama Tonakgolo John Howard jwalo ka moetapele wa mokga wa ma-Liberal..."" This indicates that Peter Costello was the leader of the Liberal Party at the time.
"
Ke hobaneng ha Australia e se na indasteri ya matla a nyutlelie?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho hloka tshehetso ya setjhaba (Lack of public support)**.

The passage states that Peter Costello is advocating for nuclear power, stating that Australia *needs* it and it's a necessity. He says there's no debate about it being necessary. This implies that the lack of nuclear power in Australia is not due to safety concerns (C), cost (D), or political opposition (B), but rather a lack of public support – the public hasn't embraced or demanded it. This is directly alluded to by Costello's strong statement about the necessity of nuclear power and the lack of debate.



"
Ke sebapadi sefe sa ski se ileng sa hlodisana ka thuso ya motataisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Mothellisi wa lehlweng ya sa boneng hantle wa Poland Maciej Krezel le motataiso wa hae Anna Ogarzynska ba qetile boemong ba leshome le metso e meraro ho Super-G."" This directly indicates that Maciej Krezel competed with the help of a guide (Anna Ogarzynska).
"
Ke naha efe e bileng ya leshome tlhodisanong ho Super-G bakeng sa boemo bo emeng ba basadi?,"The correct answer is **A: Finland**.

The text states: ""Netherlands, moo Anna Jochemsen a qetileng boemong ba borobong sehlopheng sa basadi ba emeng ho Super-G maobane, mme le Finland moo Katja Saarinen a qetileng boemong ba leshome ketsahalong yona ena."" This indicates Finland is where Katja Saarinen finished 10th in the women's Super-G.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e buang ka Blake e sa nepahalang?","The correct answer is **B: O ile a dumela tlhaselo**.

Here's why:

* The text states the board *refused* Blake's plea and stated they used a number to protect themselves from bottles thrown at them by around thirty people. 
*  ""Dumela tlhaselo"" translates to ""accepted the plea"" or ""agreed to the charge.""  Since the board *refused* the plea, saying Blake *accepted* it is inaccurate and therefore describes something Blake did incorrectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O ile a tshwarwa sebakeng seo** - ""He was arrested there"" - This is a factual statement of what happened to Blake.
* **C: O ile a sebedisa palo nakong ya tlhaselo** - ""He used a number during the plea"" - This is a factual statement about what Blake did to try and justify his actions.
* **D: O ile a bolela hore o ile a furuletswa ka dibotlolo** - ""He said he was thrown at with bottles"" - This is a factual statement of what the board said happened.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya etsahalla Blake?","The correct answer is **C: O ile a hlaselwa ka palo**.

Here's why:

* The text states the board *refused his bail application* and cited the risk of 30 alleged assaults. This implies the board believed Blake *posed a threat*, not that he was the victim of an assault.
* The text says he was ""arrested for attempting to obstruct the proper course of justice."" This confirms he was arrested.
* The text explicitly mentions the possibility of being sent to prison (""...they 'wanted him locked up'"").
* The text says he was found guilty of obstructing justice.

Therefore, the only option that didn't happen is that he was assaulted.



"
Letlole la Mokgatlo wa U.N. la ho futhumala ha lefatshe le ke ke la sebedisetswa eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Mefutafuta ya dijalo (Waste management)**.

The passage states that the UN initiative aims to help vulnerable countries adapt to global warming through things like climate-resilient housing, improved water management, and **waste management**.  Therefore, waste management *is* part of the initiative, not something it *won't* be used for.

The other options are things the initiative *will* be used for:

*   **B: Ho tlisa theknoloji dinaheng tse tswelang pele (Sharing technology with developing nations):** The passage explicitly mentions sharing technology.
*   **C: Matlo a ka emelanang le dikgohola (Climate-resilient housing):**  The passage mentions climate-resilient housing as one of the areas the money could go to.
*   **D: Ho fokotsa diphello tsa ho futhumala ha lefatshe (Mitigating the effects of global warming):** The entire premise of the UN initiative is to help countries *adapt* to the effects of global warming.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, Mokgatlo wa U.N. o tshepa ho pholosa eng?","The correct answer is **C: Meru e setseng**.

The passage states: ""Ditaba tse ding tse morerong ona mane Bali di kenyeletsa ho pholosa meru e setseng ya lefatshe..."" which translates to ""Other news in this four-pronged Bali program includes the saving of endangered species..."" The U.N. is said to hope to fund this effort.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya qotswa ke-Albert Muchanga e le ntho eo ho ntseng ho hlokahala hore ho dumellanwe ka yona?,"The correct answer is **D: Ditumellano tsa ditefiso (Tariff commitments)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ha re eso ka re dumellana mabapi le **melawana ya ho thehwa le dinyehlisetso tsa ditharife**, empa..."" (We are not yet in agreement on **tariffs and exemptions**, but...) This means tariff commitments are still a point of discussion and haven't been finalized.
* Benin joining AfCFTA and the launch date (June 1, 2020) *are* mentioned as being agreed upon or planned.
* ""Melao ya tshimoloho"" (rules of origin) is also mentioned as something that needs to be agreed upon.

Therefore, tariff commitments are the one that Albert Muchanga said they *haven't* agreed on, making it the correct answer.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, hobaneng khwebo e ka qala ka Phupu?","The correct answer is **B: Ho na le moralo o lekaneng wa melao le ditumellano tse teng.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ha re eso ka re dumellana mabapi le melawana ya ho thehwa le dinyehlisetso tsa ditharife, empa moralo oo re nang le wona o lekane ho qala kgwebisano ka la 1 Phupu, 2020."" This directly indicates that a sufficient framework of laws and agreements is in place to begin trade on that date.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Letsatsi la ho qala ha Phupu e ne e le karolo ya dipehelo tsa Nigeria bakeng sa ho kenela AfCFTA** - The text says Nigeria *announced* its intention to join, not that the start date was specifically for Nigeria.
* **C: E ile ya dumellwa ke khomishenara ya kgwebo le indasteri ya AU** - The Commissioner announced the Benin's entry, not that the date was approved solely by him.
* **D: Ho dumellanwe ka melao ya tshimoloho le ditumellano tsa ditefiso** - The text mentions laws on tariffs and prohibitions, not specifically laws on plant protection or agricultural agreements.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution e ile ya qosa diofisiri tsa thuto ka eng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho se sebetse ka mathata a ka hare a fumanweng.**

The passage states: ""Tlaleho e bontshitse hore sekolo se fumane mathata kahare empa ha se a sebetsana le diphumano tsena."" This indicates that the officials were fired for not addressing the problems revealed in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho senya tlaleho ya Journal-Constitution:** The passage doesn't mention anything about suppressing the report.
*   **B: Ho hloleha ho qapa thuto ya ditoropo:** While the school was involved in urban education, the passage doesn't link the firing to this aspect.
*   **D: Ho tlaleha dintlha tse tlase tsa tlhahlobo:** The passage implies the opposite - they failed to address the findings.



"
"Ho latela dintlha tse fanweng serapeng sena, ke eng e sa bolelwang tlalehong ya Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **D: Ditlhahiso tsa ho ntlafatsa thuto ya ditoropo (Recommendations for improving city education)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report highlighted problems with test scores and irregularities in test papers. It also mentions Hall and other officials were fired. 
* **Option D** is not mentioned in the passage. The passage focuses on the *problems* discovered (inflated scores, paper irregularities) and the *consequences* (firings). It doesn't discuss any recommendations for improving education.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntlafatso ya dintlha tse sa tlwaelehang tsa tlhahlobo (Unexpected improvements in test scores):** The passage directly contradicts this. The report highlighted *inflated* test scores, indicating they were not truly unexpected improvements.
* **B: Bopaki ba hore dipampiri tsa tlhahlobo di ile tsa senngwa (Evidence that test papers were falsified):** The passage states there was evidence of paper irregularities. While it doesn't explicitly say they were *falsified* (intentionally created or altered), it's a close enough interpretation to be considered a point covered in the passage.
* **C: Mohlodi wa Mookamedi wa Naha wa Selemo wa-2013 (National Superintendent of Schools in 2013):** Hall *was* the National Superintendent of Schools in 2013, and he was fired. So this *is* mentioned.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke boitsebiso bofe bo tsejwang ka mora ho phatloha ha dibomo?","The correct answer is **D: Palo e molaong ya batho ba shweleng (The legal number of people who were rescued)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditlaleho tse ding di behile palo ya batho ba shweleng ho robedi..."" which translates to ""Other reports placed the number of rescued people at two.""  Then, ""ditlaleho tsa semmuso di netefaditse hore batho ba ka fihlang ho 30 ba lemetse; empa dipalo tsa bofelo ha di eso tsejwe hajwale."" which translates to ""official reports confirmed that up to 30 people could be rescued; but the death toll has not yet been confirmed.""

Therefore, the *only* number explicitly mentioned as being confirmed is the number of rescued people. The other options aren't directly stated as confirmed in the text.



"
"Ho tloha ha a kena Manchester City ka-2017, Jesus o bapetse dipapadi tse kae?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text states: ""Haesale ho tloha mona, moBrazil enwa o bapetse dipapading tse 53 bakeng sa tlelapa ena ditlhodisanong tsohle..."" which translates to ""Since then, he has played 53 games for this club in all competitions...""
"
Ke sehlopha sefe seo Jesus a ileng a fumana tefo ya £27 milione bakeng sa ho kena?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The text states: ""Jesus ya dilemo tse 21 o kenetse Manchester City selemong se fetileng ka Pherekgong selemong se fetileng ka 2017 ho tswa tlelapeng ya Brazil e bitswang Palmeiras..."" This directly indicates that Palmeiras was the club that received the £27 million fee.
"
Ke polelo efe e mabapi le baeti ba hostele eo e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **C: Baeti ba ne ba le teng bosiung ba pele ho Hajj.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the guests were in Mecca during the Hajj pilgrimage.** The Hajj pilgrimage takes place during a specific time of the Islamic calendar.  The first night of Hajj is a significant event (the *mi'raj*). 
* **The passage mentions the guests are arriving during the Hajj season.** This implies they are *preparing for* or *participating in* the Hajj, not necessarily being present *on the first night*.
* **The other options are supported by the text:**
    * **A: Baeti ba ne ba le Mecca bakeng sa leeto la bodumedi:** The passage explicitly says the hostels are for Islamic pilgrims.
    * **B: Baeti ba bang e ne e se baahi ba moo:**  The passage mentions a large number of guests from the United Arab Emirates, meaning they are not locals.
    * **D: Bongata ba baeti bo ne bo tswa motseng o halalelang:**  Mecca is a holy city in Islam and considered a ""halal"" (lawful/pure) place.


Therefore, the statement about the guests being there on the *first night* of Hajj is the least likely to be true based on the given information."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang eo e leng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Baeti ba ne ba le teng pele ho leeto la hajj.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Moaho o na le badumedi ba bangata ba tlileng ho etela toropokgolo e halalelang mafelong a nako e halalelang ya bohalaledi ya hajj."" (The hotel has many guests coming to visit the holy city during the permissible time of the pilgrimage of Hajj.) This directly implies they are there for the Hajj.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho ne ho se na batho ba shweleng (There were no people who were injured):** The text says ""Palo ya batho ba shweleng ke bonyane 15"" (The number of injured people is at least 15).
* **B: Baeti bohle ba ne ba tswa United Arab Emirates (All the guests were from the United Arab Emirates):** The text specifically mentions ""Baeti ba hostele bongata e ne e le baahi ba United Arab Emirates"" (The majority of the hotel guests were residents of the United Arab Emirates), but it doesn't state that *all* of them were.
* **D: Bongata ba baeti e ne e le baahi ba Mecca (The majority of the guests were residents of Mecca):** The text states they are guests *visiting* Mecca, not residents.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke boitsebiso bofe bo mabapi le ho thulana bo sa tsitsang?","The correct answer is **A: Boholo ba ho thulana (Magnitude of the collision)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bo-rasaense ba re ho qhoma ho bakilweng ke ho thulana ho ne ho le hoholo."" (Scientists say the impact was caused by a large collision.)
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ntseng e lokela ho tsejwa mabapi le ho thulana?","The correct answer is **C: Diphetho tsa tlhahlobo ya moralo di tla arolelanwa jwang.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Phello ya mmomori ona e sekasekilweng e tla kenywa websaeteng ya setjhaba."" This directly addresses *how* the findings of the study will be shared.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ke mang ya tla sebetsana le ho latelwa ha malwanlahla:** The passage doesn't mention any legal proceedings or who might be involved.
* **B: Disathelaete di ne di tsamaya kapele hakae nakong eo ya ho thulana:** The passage provides the speed (17,500 miles per hour) but doesn't ask for a repetition of that information.
* **D: Sekala se nepahetseng hantle sa ho thulana:** While the passage mentions the collision was significant, it doesn't discuss the *scale* of the collision itself.



Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe seo Batten a kileng a ba le sona lethathamong la Batho ba ruileng ka ho Fetisisa ba Amerika?","The correct answer is **A: Ya bo-400**.

The passage states: ""Batten o bile monyehedi wa diphallelo e moholo wa sekolo sena mme o batla ho thutua le ho ts'eha, mme a kopa ho ba le thutho ya bo-400.""  (Batten was a distinguished graduate of the school and wished to pursue and develop, and asked to be granted a 400 scholarship.) This indicates he was a member of the 400 Club.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo Batten a entseng monehelo ho yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Lenane la Maamerika a ruileng ka ho fetisisa**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Batten was one of the wealthiest 400 Americans in 2008, with a fortune valued at $2.3 billion. This directly identifies him as belonging to the wealthiest echelon of American citizens.
* While he attended the University of Virginia (B), it's not the primary defining characteristic mentioned.
* The number of yachts he owned (C) is irrelevant to the question of where he made his fortune.
* Although he was a significant benefactor to the University of Virginia (D), his wealth and status as one of the wealthiest Americans is the key information.



Therefore, his position as one of the wealthiest Americans is the most accurate answer."
Ke eng eo e seng karolo ya bili e saennweng ke Musisi Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: Thibelo ya thekiso kapa ho hira dipapadi tsa video tse mabifi ho bana ba ka ntle ho California.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the law applies *within* the state of California. Options A, B, and D are all mentioned as components of the law. Option C is the *only* one that describes the law applying outside of California, which is not stated in the provided text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke bo-mang ba ileng ba fosa dintho tse neng di bolelwa?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage states: """"Mike o bua haholo nakong ya dipuisano...ke ne ke sa itokisa mme ka hona ke ne ke sa utlwe hantle seo a se buang."""""" This directly attributes the inability to understand what was being said to Miller's lack of preparedness. Therefore, Miller is the one who didn't understand the conversation.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e leng nnete ka phihlelo ya Miller nyeweng?","The correct answer is **A: Duvall o ile a kgahla Miller nakong ya nyewe (Duvall made Miller uncomfortable during the meeting)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Duvall's behavior ""didn't make Miller feel good.""
* Miller's quote reveals that Duvall talked a lot during the meeting, which made it difficult for Miller to focus and understand. This suggests Duvall's behavior was disruptive and made Miller uncomfortable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O ne a sa ele hloko ha a ntse a itokisetsa (He wasn't paying attention while preparing):**  The passage doesn't say anything about Miller's preparation. It focuses on Duvall's behavior during the meeting.
* **C: Bana ba babedi ba Duvall ba ile ba bua haholo nakong ya nyewe (Duvall's two children talked a lot during the meeting):** The passage only mentions Duvall's children are young and that Duvall doesn't feel good, it doesn't say they talked during the meeting.
* **D: O ne a shebile pale ya Duvall ka hloko (He stared intently at Duvall):** There's no mention of Miller staring at Duvall.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate interpretation of Miller's feelings based on the provided text."
Ke mang ya entseng tlhahiso ya hore ho etswe ditokiso ho ‘Molao wa Moya o Hlwekileng’?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The passage states: ""Layton o kopile ho etswa ha diphetoho ho bili ya dingangele (ma-conservative) ya tsa tikoloho nakong ya kopano le Tonakgolo..."" This indicates that Jack Layton requested changes to the Environmental Protection Act.
"
"""Ke mang ya hanneng hore """"Molao wa Moya o Hlwekileng """" o ne o sebediswa e le leano la pele ho dikgetho?""","The correct answer is **B: Tonakgolo**.

The passage states: ""Tonakgolo Stephen Harper o dumetse ho romela 'Molao wa Moya o Hlwekileng' wa mmuso komiting ya mekga yohle bakeng sa tekodiso..."" which translates to ""Prime Minister Stephen Harper approved sending the 'Spirit of the Times' bill from the government to the Standing Committee for review..."" This directly indicates that Stephen Harper initiated the bill's submission.
"
Metswako ya cyanuric acid le melamine e ile ya etsa eng ha e kopana ka hara moroto wakatse?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikristale**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Dikhomphaonde tse pedi tsena di riekta bobedi ho theha dikristale tse ka nnang tsa thibela tshebetso ya diphio..."" which translates to ""These two compounds react to form crystals that may prevent the function of kidneys..."".
"
Bafuputsi ba ile ba sebedisa tekanyo ya ho hlahloba mahlasedi a kotsi ho bona eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Sebopeho sa kristale morotong wa phoofolo.**

Here's why:

The text states that the researchers used a method to *examine* the crystals found in the cat's urine. They specifically mention comparing the crystal structure to those found in pet food that had been exposed to melamine and cyanuric acid using FTIR spectroscopy.  This directly points to analyzing the crystal structure.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Mosebetsi oa diphio (Kidney Function):** While melamine and cyanuric acid *can* impact kidney function, the text focuses on *identifying* the crystals themselves.
* **C: Diphoofolo tsa lapeng tse amehileng (Sick Pets):** The presence of crystals in the urine is a symptom of a potential illness, but the research is focused on *what the crystals are*.
* **D: Dijo tsa diphoofolo tse ruuwang lapeng tse silafetseng (Spoiled Pet Food):** While spoiled food is the source of the contaminants, the research is focused on analyzing the *crystals* that have formed in the animal's urine.



"
Ke mang ya ileng a re Luna ke “Mofumahadi ya Feteletseng”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The passage states: ""Tommy Dreamer o itse """"Luna ene e le Mofumahadi wa pele wa Phetello."""""".
"
"""Ke mang ya ileng a bitsa Luna e le """"ya makatsang""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels o boletse hore """"Luna o ne a makatsa jwalo ka nna...ebile mohlomong le ho feta...re ne re mo rata mme re tla mo hopola...re tshepa hore o sebakeng se setle jwale."""" which translates to ""Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said """"Luna was as strong as me...and maybe even more...we loved her and we will remember her...we hope she is in a good place now.""""
"
Ke eng e sa kang ya etsahala ka mokganni ya amehileng kotsing?,"The correct answer is **B: Ha aa ka a ntsha motho leha e le ofe ya neng a le ka tlung kotsi.**

Here's why:

* The question asks what *didn't* happen. The text states the emergency services *rescued* the driver from the car.
* Option B states the driver ""couldn't rescue anyone."" The text indicates the opposite - he *was* rescued.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O ile a tswa dikotsi hloohong:** The text explicitly mentions the driver had head injuries.
* **C: O ile a tloswa sepetleleng sa Cambridge ho ya ho se seng sa Great Yarmouth:** The text says he was *transferred* to Cambridge *from* Great Yarmouth.
* **D: Ditshebeletso tsa tshohanyetso di ile tsa mo thusa ho mo ntsha koloing ya hae:** The text clearly says the emergency services *rescued* him *from* the car.

Ke eng e neng e sa hlahella ka papadi ya Afrika Borwa nakong ya tlhodisano ya rugby?,"The correct answer is **C: Tshebetso e ntlafaditsweng qalong ya tlhodisano**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...e ne e le letsatsi le letle bakeng sa rugby ya dibapadi tse 7. Afrika Borwa eo e leng hodimo tlhodisanong e qadile hantle ha e hlola hantle ka 26 - 00 kgahlanong le Zambia eo e leng boemong ba 5. Afrika Borwa e shebahala ntle ho pelaelo e le nthithi papading ya yona kgahlanong le bokgaitsedi ba yona ba tswang borwa, leha ho le jwalo e ile ya ntlafala butle-butle ha tlhodisano e tswela pele. **Ho itshireletsa ha bona ho leng taeong, bokgoni ba ho tshwara bolo le ho sebetsa jwaloka sehlopha ho babatsehang ho ba entse hore ba hlahelle...**""

This indicates that while Afrika Borwa started strong in defense, ball handling, and teamwork, they *improved* as the match progressed. Option C directly reflects this improvement during the early stages of the game. The other options are things they already excelled at.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, papadi ya Afrika Borwa e qadile neng ho ntlafala?","The correct answer is **D: Ha tlhodisano e ntse e tswela pele** (During the match).

The text states: ""Afrika Borwa e shebahala ntle ho pelaelo e le nthithi papading ya yona kgahlanong le bokgaitsedi ba yona ba tswang borwa, leha ho le jwalo e ile ya ntlafala butle-butle ha tlhodisano e tswela pele."" This translates to: ""South Africa appeared without doubt as the favorite in the match against their southern opponent, although it gradually improved as the match progressed.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bontsheng moruo wa China ka nepo?","The correct answer is **D: China ha e so ka e romela dikoloi tse ngata ho feta Jeremane**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Leha e dutse semmuso e le naha ya bokomonisi, China e thehile moruo wa mebaraka. Diphetoho tsa pele di bile tlasa boetapele ba Deng Xiaoping. Haesale ho tloha moo, saese ya moruo wa China e hotse ka boikatiso ba makgetlo a 90. Lekgetlo la pele, selemong se fetileng China e rometse ntle makoloi a fetang a Jeremane mme ya feta United States jwalo ka mmaraka o moholo ka ho fetisisa bakeng sa indasteri ena."" This clearly indicates China *does* export more cars to Germany than the US.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage:

* **A: Moruo wa China o hotse haholo ho tloha ha ho etswa dintlafatso:** The passage says China's economy has grown significantly since reforms began under Deng Xiaoping.
* **B: China e na le mmaraka o moholo wa thekiso ya dikoloi ho feta United States:** The passage directly states China surpassed the US as the largest car market.
* **C: China e ka qetella e na le GDP e kgolo ho feta United States:** The passage suggests this possibility, stating that China's GDP could be larger than the US's in the future.



Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the passage's information is D.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, GDP ya China e ne e ka feta United States neng?","The correct answer is **D: Nakong ya dilemo tse mashome a mararo**

Here's why:

The text states: ""GDP ya China e ka ba kgolo ho feta ya United States nakong ya dilemo tse mashome a mararo."" This translates to ""China's GDP could surpass that of the United States in thirty years.""

Therefore, option D is the only one supported by the information provided in the text.
"
Hu o ile a etsa tlhahiso ya hore dinaha tse tswelang pele di etse eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho qoba ditsela tsa kgale tsa tshilafalo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hu o kgothaleditse dinaha tse holang """"hore di qobe motjha wa kgale wa ho silafatsa pele ebe ba hlwekisa kamorao."""" "" This translates to ""He supported developed countries """"to avoid the old model of leading and then lagging behind."""" ""  Avoiding the ""old model of leading and then lagging behind"" directly refers to avoiding the path of relying on cheap labor and polluting industries – a key aspect of historical industrialization. Therefore, ""Ho qoba ditsela tsa kgale tsa tshilafalo"" (Avoiding old industrialization models) is the most accurate interpretation.
"
Ke eng e sa kang ya bolelwa ke Hu?,"The correct answer is **C: Letsatsi leo ka tshepo ho tla fokotswa ho tswa ha khabone.**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on China's commitment to reducing carbon intensity.** Hu Jintao discusses the goal of reducing carbon intensity per unit of GDP, with a target based on 2005 levels by 2020.
* **He emphasizes the impact on China's industrial output.** This is a key aspect of his statement.
* **He calls for developed countries to lead the way in addressing climate change.**  This is a clear call for action.
* **He acknowledges China's right to development and self-reliance.** This balances environmental concerns with national priorities.

**Option C, however, is not mentioned.** The passage doesn't specify *when* carbon emissions are expected to peak. It focuses on reducing *intensity* and the broader commitment to environmental responsibility.



Therefore, C is the statement that is *not* discussed in the provided text."
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo Veerman a ileng a re boemo bo ne bo se botle?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The quote states: """"Angola e tobane le sewa se sebe ka ho fetisisa sa yona mme boemo bo dutse ho le bobe haholo Angola,"""" which translates to ""Angola is facing the worst epidemic in its history and the situation is very bad in Angola.""
"
"Ka lebaka la qoso, ke mang ya tla nka boemo ba Khabinete ya Huhne?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The statement explicitly says: ""Huhne o itokolotse mme o tla nkelwa sebaka Khabineteng ke Ed Davey MP."" (Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the Cabinet by Ed Davey MP.)
"
Ke mang ya tla nka karolo ya Letona la Kgwebo ka mora qoso?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The statement says ""Norman Lamb MP o lebeletswe ho nka mosebetsi wa Letona la Kgwebo oo Davey a tswang ho wona."" (Norman Lamb MP is expected to take the post of Business Secretary that Davey is moving on from.)
"
Dibini kapa diletsi ba kgothalletsa bamamedi ho etsa eng nakong ya opera ya Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho tla sethaleng bakeng sa ho bina le bona**.

The passage states: ""Ka lebaka lena, dibapadi di tsuba dizolo tsa matekwane sethaleng, mme teatere ka boyona e kgothaletsa babohi ho etsa ka jwalo le bona."" This translates to: ""For this reason, the performers wear fan-shaped robes on stage, and the theater itself encourages the audience to do the same.""  Therefore, the audience is encouraged to come to the stage and dance.
"
Ke mang ya tsubang matekwane nakong ya opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Dibini le diletsi**.

The passage states: ""Pale e tekilweng ho opera ya Fora, ke Camille Saint-Saens, ke ya sebapadi sa tsa bonono """"seo bophelo ba sona bo laolwang ke lerato la dithethefatsi le Japane."""" **Ka lebaka lena, dibapadi di tsuba dizolo tsa matekwane sethaleng, mme teatere ka boyona e kgothaletsa babohi ho etsa ka jwalo le bona.**""

This translates to: ""Pale is arranged for the opera of Fora, it is by Camille Saint-Saens, a performer of the art whose life is governed by the love of artists and Japan. **Therefore, the performers throw flower petals on the stage, and the theater itself encourages the audience to do the same.**""

Therefore, the performers (dibapadi) and the audience (diletsi) throw flower petals. Option C best reflects this.
"
"""Lebitso le leng la """"ho tsamaya sepakapakeng"""" ha Leonov ke lefe?""","The correct answer is **C: Tshebetso ya kantle**.

The text states that Leonov performed an ""extravehicular activity"" (EVA), which is another term for ""tshebetso ya kantle"" (working outside). While the other options are related to Leonov's career, they don't directly answer the question about the alternative name for ""ho tsamaya sepakapakeng.""
"
Leonov o ile a etella pele karolo ya Soviet ya leeto lefe?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Dilemo tse leshome ha morao, o eteletse pele karolo ya Soviet ya leeto la Apollo–Soyuz le bileng sesupo sa hore Tlhodisano ya tsa Sepakapakeng e fedile.""  This translates to: ""Fifty years later, he headed the Soviet part of the Apollo–Soyuz mission which marked the end of the Space Race.""
"
Ke mang ya lemetseng kotsing eo?,"The correct answer is **B: Mosebetsi wa karatjhe**.

The text states: ""Motho ya sebetsang keratjheng e haufi le moo sebakeng seo kotsi e hlahileng ho sona o itse..."" which translates to ""A worker close to where the accident happened knew..."" This indicates that a nearby worker witnessed the accident.
"
Ho ile ha etsahalang ka batho ba amehileng kotsing eo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka bobedi ba ile ba shwa**.

The passage states: ""Gibson o nketswe sepetlele empa a shwa nakwana kamora moo."" (Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.) and ""Ho na le bana ba neng ba emetse ho tshela tsela me kaofela ba ne ba hoeletsa le ho lla."" (There were children who were waiting to live on the road and all of them cried and wailed.)  While the children didn't necessarily go to a hospital, the statement implies they were severely affected and ""shwa"" (suffered greatly/were badly hurt) by the accident. Option A best reflects the overall impact on the people involved.
"
Bo-rasaense ba sebetsang lenaneong lena ba ne ba tshepile ho bona diphello tse bakilweng ke efe ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikarolwana tse nyane (Small components)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tumelo ena e bolela hore bongata ba dark matter e potileng galaxy e sebakeng se potileng galaxy ka sebopeho sa halo, mme e bopilwe ka dikarolwana tse ngata tse nyane."" 

This translates to: ""This belief implies that the majority of dark matter in a galaxy is located in the halo of the galaxy and is composed of many small components.""

Therefore, the scientists were expecting to observe **small components** within the dark matter halo.  The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
Bo-rasaense ba ne ba hlokometse ntho ya efe ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **B: Lefatshe le sehlopha sa dinaledi sa Sagittarius**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the program was designed to study the tidal forces acting on the Sagittarius galaxy, and that these forces are analogous to the tides caused by the Moon on Earth.  The passage then goes on to discuss the interaction of dark matter in the Milky Way and Sagittarius galaxies. Therefore, the scientists observed the relationship between the Earth/Moon analogy and the Sagittarius galaxy.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Molala le Kgwedi:** While the analogy uses the Moon and Earth, the primary focus of the scientific observation was the Sagittarius galaxy.
*   **C: Lefatshe le Kgwedi:** Same reasoning as A.
*   **D: Sehlopha sa dinaledi sa Sagittarius le Molala:** While both are mentioned, the core of the observation related to the interaction *between* the Sagittarius galaxy and the forces analogous to tidal forces (Earth/Moon).



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e sa nyatsweng ke batho dingangele?","The correct answer is **B: Kgaello ya boiteko ba kaho botjha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tshehollo ya boliberale ya mohato wa kahobotjha o tsepamisitse maikutlo ho dima kabo ya dikonteraka tsa kahobotjha ho ba bonweng jwalo ka bo-metlakgola ba Washington."" This means the liberal initiative focused on *highlighting* affordable housing contracts. It doesn't say they focused on *the idea* of affordable housing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tjhelete ya diphallelo:** The passage mentions financial aid in relation to Katrina recovery, so it is relevant.
*   **C: Ke mang ya fuwang dikonteraka tsa kaho botjha:** The passage mentions ""kabo ya dikonteraka,"" implying there *were* contracts, though it doesn't specify who received them. The focus is on the contracts themselves.
*   **D: Tjhelete ya ho haha botjha:** The passage refers to financial aid but doesn't specify the funds are specifically for rebuilding. It's broader.

Therefore, the passage focuses on making affordable housing contracts visible, not on the concept of affordable housing itself.



"
Ke mang ya nyatsang dikonteraka tsa kaho botjha bakeng sa boiteko ba diphallelo ba Lehodiotswana Katrina?,"The correct answer is **C: Bush**.

The passage states: ""Tshehollo ya boliberale ya mohato wa kahobotjha o tsepamisitse maikutlo ho dima kabo ya dikonteraka tsa kahobotjha ho ba bonweng jwalo ka bo-metlakgola ba Washington.""  This means the Bush administration (representing Washington) focused on establishing a system of reconstruction contracts.  The passage also refers to this system as ""Bush's New Orleans Deal"".
"
"Ho latela seratswana, mabone a tswang sefofa-sebakeng sa Stardust a tla bonahala hokae pele?","The correct answer is **B: California Leboya**.

The text states: ""E tla fofa hodima lebopo le ka bophirima la California Leboya..."" which translates to ""It will glow over the western part of California...""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, sefofa-sebakeng se tla beha rekoto bakeng sa efe ho tse latelang?","The correct answer is **A: Ho kgantsha lehodimo ka bophara (Mapping the globe broadly)**.

The text states that Stardust will ""take the fastest record for a spacecraft to return to Earth, which is the first ever recorded since the Apollo X spacecraft returned to Earth in 1969.""  The description of the trajectory – ""It will fly over the northern and western California, and show the planet from California to the interior of Oregon and to Nevada and Idaho, to Utah"" – implies it will be mapping a large area of the globe.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho bonahala metseng e mengata (Appearing in many places):** While it will appear in multiple locations, the main purpose isn't just to appear, but to record a trajectory.
*   **C: Ho kgutlela Lefatsheng kapele (Returning to Earth quickly):** The text specifies the record is for the *fastest return*, not just a quick return.
*   **D: Ho tsamaya ka potlako ho tloha San Francisco ho ya Los Angeles (Traveling quickly from San Francisco to Los Angeles):** This is just one small part of the overall trajectory and not the main purpose of the mission.

Therefore, the best answer is that Stardust will be mapping the globe broadly.



"
Ngaka Malar Balasubramanian o ne a amana jwang le Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Mme**.

The text states that Saroja Balasubramanian is the mother of Dr. Malar Balasubramanian.
"
Setopo sa Sara Balasubramanian se fumanwe hokae?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka kutu ya koloi**.

The text states: ""At the Oldsmobile Intrigue parked about 500 feet down the road, they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, pinned under the car.""
"
Ke eng e rekilweng ke eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states that eBay is most successful in terms of volume and that they have partnered with companies like Skype to gain prominence in specific regions. The question asks what eBay has sold, and the context points to Skype as a significant partnership.
"
eBay e batla ho fihlela eng ka ho reka?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho atolohela dibakeng tse ntjha** (To expand into new markets).

Here's why:

The passage states that eBay is focusing on countries like China, Western Europe, and Brazil. This clearly indicates a desire to expand its business operations and reach new customer bases.  The mention of Skype being successful in those markets further reinforces this strategy.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kopanya tjhelete ya yona** (To generate revenue) - While expansion *will* generate revenue, it's not the primary stated goal. The focus is on *where* they're generating that revenue.
* **C: Phahamisa boemo ba yona** (To improve its image) - While a successful expansion *could* improve image, the passage doesn't explicitly state this as the driving force.
* **D: Kgotsofatsa boradiabo ba yona** (To satisfy its shareholders) - This is a general goal for most companies, but not the specific focus highlighted in the text.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mang ya sa kang a sebedisana le batshwaruwa ba ileng ba sala ka jareteng ka mora ntwa?","The correct answer is **A: Ba dipuisano (The interpreters)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...baofisiri ba neng ba apere diaparo tsa merusu ba kena serapeng mme ba thulana le batshwaruwa ka ho ba thunyetsa kgase e llisang mahlo. Dihlopha tsa bapholosi ba batimamollo ba timme mollo ka 11:35 pm.""

This means the officers and the paramedics left after the situation was handled. The question asks who *didn't* stay. The text doesn't mention interpreters being present or leaving. The other options *were* involved in handling the situation. Therefore, the interpreters are the ones who likely remained.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ileng ya qetella e entse hore batshwaruwa ba ikhule moferefereng oo?,"The correct answer is **B: Kgase e llisang (Pepper spray)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that officers used pepper spray on the rioters *immediately* after they started throwing things at the officers.  This direct action is what likely caused the rioters to retreat.  While other factors might have contributed, the pepper spray is the last described event that directly caused the rioters to disperse.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Dipuisano tse atlehileng (Successful negotiations):** There's no indication of successful negotiations in the passage.
* **C: Batshwaruwa-mmoho le bona ba lemetseng (Other rioters realized):** While this *could* have played a role, the pepper spray was the immediate trigger.
* **D: Mollo (The crowd):** The crowd *was* the problem, but the pepper spray was the action taken *against* them.



"
"Ka maikutlo a Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, naha ya Iran e lokela ho itokolla ho eng?","The correct answer is **D: Ho itshetleha ka oli**.

The text explicitly states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei views oil as the ""lifeblood"" of Iran and that the country ""must rely on it.""  The passage also discusses the impact of sanctions and the importance of oil revenue to Iran's economy. This strongly indicates his belief in self-reliance through oil production and export.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya amohetseng ditlamorao tsa kotlo moruong wa Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Mehlodi e phahameng**.

The passage states: ""Maikutlo, a hlahiswang ka kotloloho thelevisheneng, e ne e le lekgetlo la pele mehlodi e phahameng ya Iran e amohetseng hore dikotlo di ba le tshwaelo ya letho."" (Translation: A radio broadcast, which was the first time a high-ranking Iranian broadcaster accepted that the press has the right to everything.)

Therefore, the high-ranking Iranian broadcaster (referred to as ""mehlodi e phahameng"") is the entity that accepted the right of the press.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng karolo ya tshebetso ya ho vouta ya Fora?,"The correct answer is **B: Baemedi ba rometsweng ke bokgethi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bakgethwa ha ka romela baemedi ba bona ho ba dipaki bakeng sa karolo e nngwe le e nngwe ya tshebetso ena."" (Cashiers cannot send witnesses as evidence for any part of this process.)

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the Fora voting process:

*   **A: Mabokose a ho vouta a pepeneneng:** The text states that ballot boxes must be sealed since 1988.
*   **C: Ho saena lenane la dikgetho:** The text explicitly mentions that the cashier signs the ballot box after verification.
*   **D: Dikgetho di balwa ke baithaopi tlasa bodisa bo matla:** The text mentions that ballot boxes are counted by independent auditors.



"
Bakgethi ba bontsha mokgethwa owu bona hokae?,"The correct answer is **C: Hodima enfelopo** (On the envelope).

The text states: ""bakgethi ba itsheka ho kena ka hara di-booth, ba tshele pampitshana e seng e hatisitswe e bontshang mokgethwa wa bona **ka enfelopong**."" (workers have to enter booths, they seal an unsealed envelope showing their fingerprint **on the envelope**.)
"
Ke eng e entseng hore Allen a qale ho batlana le Musashi ka dilemo tse robedi?,"The correct answer is **B: Thahasello ya hae ho mmapa wa lewatle**.

The passage states: ""Kamora ho latella mmapa wa masalla a ho swahlamana botebong ba lewatle malwanglwahla a fumanwe ka ho sebedisa ROV.  **Allen ho bolelwa a tsetetse boholo ba leruo la hae ditshibollong tsa lewatleng mme a qala mekutu ya hae ya ho fumana Musashi ka ha ka nako e telele o ne a kgahlehela ntwa eo.**""

This indicates that Allen's interest in ocean maps led him to start searching for Musashi. While his oceanography background and research are relevant, the passage specifically links his *interest in the map* to initiating the search. Option A (his reef) and C (his marine research) are not directly mentioned as the *starting point* of his quest for Musashi. Option D (his interest in the seabed) is too general.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, Allen o sebedisitse tjhelete e ngata ho eng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho theha ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle)**.

The text states: ""Kamora ho latella mmapa wa masalla a ho swahlamana botebong ba lewatle malwanglwahla a fumanwe ka ho sebedisa **ROV**.""  This directly indicates that a ROV was used, and ROVs are expensive to build.  The text also mentions Allen ""ho tsetetse boholo ba leruo la hae ditshibollong tsa lewatleng"" suggesting a significant investment in underwater exploration equipment.

The other options are less directly supported:

* **A: Ho tsosolosa Musashi** - The text implies he *found* Musashi, not that he spent money to retrieve it.
* **B: Patlisiso ya metsing** - While part of the process, the text doesn't specify that significant funds were spent *on* underwater research in general.  It focuses on the ROV.
* **D: Ho ithuta ka mmapa wa katlase wa leoatle** - While map study might have been involved, the construction and use of the ROV were likely the major expense.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ka nnang ya ba e lebisitse maemong a kotsi ka hara semela le ho se potoloha?","The correct answer is **A: Mafura a Uranium (Uranium dust)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that radioactive caesium and iodine were found in the plant.  However, it also mentions that scientists believe the plant's radiation is due to uranium-fueled reactors.  Uranium dust is a direct result of uranium processing and can be inhaled, leading to health risks.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are less likely to be the *cause* of the danger:

*   **B: Cesium ya mahlasedi (Cesium from the plant):** While caesium is radioactive and harmful, it was *found* in the plant, not necessarily the *cause* of the dangerous situation.
*   **C: Mosi o mosweu (White smoke):** The white smoke is a symptom of the plant's condition, not the primary danger. It's indicative of the release of radioactive materials, but not the source.
*   **D: Iodine:**  Iodine can be harmful in high doses, but it's not directly linked to the nuclear reaction itself as uranium is. Also, it was mentioned as a substance found in the plant, but not as the main source of the problem.

Therefore, the uranium dust is the most likely substance to have led to the dangerous situation.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng e nngwe ya dikeletso tsa polokeho tse kgothaleditsweng ho baahi ba lehae ho latela ketsahalo e etsahetseng femeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Qoba ho sebedisa di-yuniti tsa air conditioning.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically advises people to stay indoors, close windows and doors, and avoid using tap water.** This is to minimize exposure to radioactive particles.
* **Air conditioning units can draw in outside air**, potentially bringing in radioactive particles. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using them.
* **The other options (staying indoors, avoiding inhaling smoke, and avoiding tap water) are all explicitly mentioned as safety precautions.**



Therefore, the only option that is *not* mentioned as a recommended safety precaution in the passage is avoiding the use of air conditioning."
"Ho ya ka Dr. Moll, ke eng e tshwenyang haholo ka XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **C: Bongata ba batho bao motho ya tshwaeditsweng a ka ba tshwaetsang.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nakong ya selemo se le seng, motho ya tshwaeditsweng a ka nna a tshwaetsa batho ba ka bang 10 ho fihla ho 15 bao a atamelaneng haholo le bona."" This highlights the significant risk of transmission associated with XDR-TB. While the other options are related to XDR-TB, the sheer number of potential infections is the primary concern Dr. Moll expresses.
"
Ke bakudi ba bakae ba tshwaeditsweng ke mofuta o motjha o fapaneng ba netefaditsweng hore ke basebeletsi ba tsa bophelo bo botle?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text specifically states: ""bonyane ba babedi ba bona e ne e le basebetsi ba bophelo ba sepetlele."" (a small number of them were hospital workers.)
"
Sistimi ya NextGen e sebedisa theknoloji ya mofuta ofe?,"The correct answer is **A: Theknoloji e thehilweng ho sathelaete**.

The passage explicitly states: ""E sebedisa bothekenoloji ba sathalaete ho fapana le bothekenoloji ba fatshe ba radar..."" which translates to ""It uses satellite technology in contrast to ground-based radar technology..."".
"
NextGen e thusa balaodi ba sephethephethe sa sefofane ka kotloloho jwang?,"The correct answer is **B: Dibaka tse nepahetseng haholwanyane tsa difofane.**

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen uses satellite technology to allow operators to find drones with much greater precision, enabling them to land at more precise locations.  This is directly related to providing more accurate and precise landing spots for drones.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **A: Ditsela tse khutshwane tsa ho fofa:** While improved precision *helps* with efficient routing, the primary focus of the technology described is not on creating new flight paths.
* **C: Ho fokotseha ha khabone:**  Reducing carbon emissions is a benefit of using drones, but it's not the *direct* way NextGen helps operators.
* **D: Mafura a fokolang:**  Reduced emissions are a consequence of using drones instead of traditional aircraft, not a direct impact of the NextGen system.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, bo-rahistori ha baa ka ba nyatsa FBI ka ho tsepamisa maikutlo ho eng?","The correct answer is **A: Ho matlafatsa sekhahla sa katleho ya bona**.

The passage states that the FBI was focusing on easy-to-solve cases involving stolen vehicles to *increase their success rate*. The FBI's decision to allocate resources to this area was driven by a desire to improve their overall performance.
"
Boikemisetso ba manyala bo qobella FBI ho etsa eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Matlafatsa sekhahla sa katleho ya setsi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the FBI's goal was to **increase its success rate** in solving seemingly easy cases involving stolen vehicles. The funding provided was specifically to achieve this goal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abela disebediswa tse eketsehileng bakeng sa dinyewe tsa dikoloi tse utswitsweng:** While increased resources might be *part* of the effort, the *primary* objective is not just more resources, but a higher success rate.
*   **C: Tsepamisa maikutlo holima ditlolo tsa molao tse lokelang ho ba bonolo ho di rarolla:**  The passage mentions focusing on easy cases, not necessarily on developing new legal strategies.
*   **D: Baemedi ba inehetseng dinyeweng tsa ditshwantsho tsa bootswa:** The passage focuses on stolen *vehicles*, not ""bootswa"" (likely a typo for ""boots"" or something similar). Furthermore, the emphasis is on solving cases, not acquiring new types of evidence.



"
Ho etsahetseng ka koloi ya mollo e ileng ya arabela kotsing ya JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **C: E ile ya phatloha** (It exploded).

The text states: ""setima-mollo sa boemafofane se ile sa phethoha ha sene se phallela koduwa ena"" which translates to ""the airframe exploded when something ignited in this area"".
"
"Ka mora ho wa ha JAS 39C Gripen, boema-fofane bo ile ba kwallwa ho eng?","The correct answer is **A: Difofane tsa kgwebo (Commercial aircraft)**.

The text states: ""...e leng se bakileng ho kwalwa ha boemafofane bakeng sa difofane tsa baeti."" which translates to ""...resulting in the recording of airspace for **commercial aircraft**.""
"
Brzezinski o ile a fana ka tataiso ho mang nakong ya Phetohelo ya Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Swagong ya NSA, o thusitse Carter ho sebetsana le ditaba tsa bodiplomate tsa lefatshe, jwalo ka Camp David Accords, 1978; ho tlisa maemong a matle dikamano dipakeng tsa US–China dilemong tsa bo-1970; Phetolo ya Puso ya Iran, e lebisitseng tlokotsing ya ho kwetelwa le ho tshwarwa ha batho, 1979; le tlhaselong ya Soviet mane Afghanistan, 1979.""

This indicates Brzezinski advised Carter during the Iranian Revolution. Henry Kissinger is mentioned as someone Brzezinski replaced as NSA, and Kennedy and Johnson are mentioned in the context of Brzezinski's earlier roles.
"
Ke mang ya ileng a tshwara boemo ba Moeletsi wa Tshireletso ya Setjhaba ho fihlela ka-1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The provided text states that Brzezinski ""hlahlama Henry Kissinger"" to become National Security Advisor in 1977. This implies that Kissinger held the position *before* Brzezinski.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bontsheng hantle mosebetsi wa Bobek le Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **B: O ile a kora hangata ho feta sebapadi leha e le sefe** (He scored more often than any other player).

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Bobek scored 403 goals in 468 appearances and that no other player in the history of the club has scored more goals or made more appearances.** This directly contradicts the statement that he scored more often than any other player.
* **A: O ile a kora ka makgetlo a fetang 468 ha a ntse a bapalla sehlopha** (He scored over 468 goals while playing for the club) - This is directly supported by the passage.
* **C: O kile a kgethwa e le sebapadi se hlwahlwa historing ya sehlopha** (He was chosen as the club's most valuable player in history) - This is also directly supported by the passage.
* **D: O hlahile dipapading tse ngata ho feta dibapadi tse ding** (He scored more goals than other players) - This is supported by the passage, as no one has scored more.



Therefore, option B is the only statement that doesn't accurately reflect the information provided in the text.
"
Ke polelo efe ka nalane ya Bobek le Partizan Belgrade eo e leng nnete?,"The correct answer is **C: O ile a bapalla Partizan ho fihlela ka-1958.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""O se kenetse ka 1945 mme a ba ho sona ho fihlela ka 1958."" (He joined in 1945 and stayed until 1958.)
* **Option A is incorrect:** The text says he joined in 1945.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The text says he played for Zagreb *before* joining Partizan.
* **Option D is partially correct but incomplete:** While he did become a legendary player, the text specifies he stayed until 1958.

Therefore, the most accurate statement is that he played for Partizan Belgrade until 1958.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke tshobotsi efe e kgethollang Hesperonychus ho Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: E na le lenala la bobedi le leholwanyane.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Dinala tsa yona tse kamorao di kgolwanyane, e leng se di fang lebitso la Hesperonychus le bolelang """"dinala tsa bophirima."""" ""  This translates to ""Its hind limbs were small, which gave it the name Hesperonychus, meaning """"western claw."""""".  This directly links the small hind limbs to the distinction between Hesperonychus and Velociraptor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E na le maoto a mabedi:**  Both Hesperonychus and Velociraptor were bipedal (walked on two legs).
* **C: E na le mmele o masiba ka botlalo:** While the text mentions a feathered body, this isn't what specifically distinguishes it from Velociraptor in the provided passage.  Many dromaeosaurids were feathered.
* **D: E futhumetse madi:** The text states it had warm blood, but this is also a characteristic shared with some other dinosaurs and not the defining difference between Hesperonychus and Velociraptor according to this text.



"
"""Moelelo wa """"Hesperonychus"""" o tswa ho sebopeho sefe sa mmele wa mofuta oo?""","The correct answer is **A: Dinala (Legs)**.

The text states: ""Dinala tsa yona tse kamorao di kgolwanyane, e leng se di fang lebitso la Hesperonychus le bolelang """"dinala tsa bophirima."""" "" which translates to ""Its hind legs were small, which gave it the name Hesperonychus meaning """"western legs."""" ""
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang tse mabapi le ho thunya eo e leng nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: Monna le mosadi ba ne ba tswa Texas ka bobedi**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Balekane ba ne ba nyalane mane Texas nakong ya selemo se fetileng mme ba tlile Buffalo ho tla keteka le metswalle le beng ba bona."" (The attendees had spent the previous year in Texas and came to Buffalo to celebrate with their colleagues and friends.) This directly confirms that people traveled *from* Texas.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The text states there were four people who were in the hospital but weren't initially recognized. It doesn't say there were five people injured.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The text says the people *spent* the previous year in Texas, implying the celebration happened *after* that year.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The text explicitly states the celebration happened *in* Buffalo.



"
Ke polelo efe e nepahetseng mabapi le ketsahalo eo ho thunngwa ho etsahetseng ho yona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho etsahetse ketsahalong e hlophisitsweng ya sehopotso**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ketsahalo ya semolao ya sehopotso e ne e hlophiseditswe ho ba ka letsatsi la hamorao..."" (The anniversary celebration was organized for the following day...). This indicates a planned event.
* Option A is too general. While it was a celebration, it's not specifically described as *just* a ""moketeng"" (gathering/celebration).
* Option C is incorrect because the event happened in Buffalo, not Texas.
* Option D is too vague and doesn't capture the specific type of event.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and specific description of the event.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, qalong ke ho tshwenyeha hofe hoo diofisiri di neng di na le hona ka Luno?","The correct answer is **C: Ho qhalana ha mafura**.

The text explicitly states: ""Luno e ne e na le dikhubiki mitara tse 120–160 tsa mafura ha e robeha..."" which translates to ""On Monday, it had 120-160 cubic meters of water in the cargo hold because the ship was leaking..."" This indicates the primary issue was the leaking and accumulation of water.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ya dipolelo tse latelang mabapi le ho senyeha ha Luno eo e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Ho senyeha ho etsahetse pele ho nka tlwaelo (The sinking happened before the rescue attempt)**.

Here's why:

* The text states the ship was sinking *while* it was on its way to bring the doctor. This indicates the sinking began *before* the rescue operation started.
* Options B, C, and D are all directly supported by the text. The ship was 100 meters long, there were 107 crew members, and the ship did indeed sink.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text.
"
Algeria e fumane boipuso ka dilemo dife tse leshome?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka bo 1960**.

The text states: ""Ka dilemo tsa bo-1960 o ile a kgutlela naheng e neng e sa tswa fumana boipuso ya Algeria..."" which translates to ""In the 1960s he returned to the country which had not yet gained independence from Algeria...""
"
Ke hokae moo dithelevishene di neng di sa lokisetswa tshebeletso ya lepato?,"The correct answer is **B: Metseng e fapaneng ya Italy**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Bongateng ba ditoropokgolo tsa Ithali le lefatsheng lohle, haholoholo naheng ya Poland, metheo e tshwanang e ile ya etswa, e bohilweng ke palo e kgolo ya batho."" This translates to ""Throughout the cities of Italy and the world, especially in Poland, similar arrangements were made to accommodate the large number of people.""

This implies that TVs were set up in various locations *within Italy* to allow people to watch the event if they couldn't get to St. Peter's Square.  Option A is too specific, Option C is not directly supported by the text, and Option D is incorrect because TVs wouldn't be set up *within* St. Peter's Square to accommodate the crowds.



"
Tshebeletso ya lepato e ne e tshwaretswe hokae?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebakeng sa St. Peter's Square**.

The text explicitly states that the service was held in St. Peter's Square. While other locations (like Roma and Poland) had similar arrangements for viewing, the service itself took place in the square.
"
"Ka mora ho phatloha hoo, ke mang ya ileng a phekolwa dikotsi tse mpe?","The correct answer is **A: Bonyane batho ba bahlano**.

The text states: ""empa bonyane batho ba bahlano ba neng ba le sebakeng sena ka nako ya ho phatloha ba alafetswe matshwao a ho kula a tsitsipano ya mmele."" This translates to ""but five people who were in the area at the time of the explosion were given symptoms of acute illness.""
"
Ke mang ya tlalehileng ho dutla ha kgase?,"The correct answer is **A: Moahelani mohahong (The resident of the apartment)**.

The text states: ""Moahisani a mo letsetse mabapi le ho dutla ha kgase."" which translates to ""The resident contacted him regarding a gas leak.""  Therefore, the resident is the one who initially reported the gas leak.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke batho ba bakae ba shweleng tlhaselong eo?","The correct answer is **C: 5**.

The text states: ""Batho ba hlokahetseng e bile Nicholas Alden, 25, le Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback e ne e le yena moqhobi. Edgar Veguilla o fumane maqeba a sephakeng le mohlareng ha Kristoffer Schneider a ile a hloka ho fumantshwa opareishene ya kahobotjha bakeng sa sefahleho sa hae. Sebetsa sa Uka se hlolehile ha se ne se supile monna wa bohlano hloohong.""

This translates to: ""The people who were injured were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was the driver. Edgar Veguilla found information on the internet about Kristoffer Schneider who needed cosmetic surgery for his face. Uka's work successfully repaired a man with five wounds on his head.""

Therefore, there are five people who were injured.
"
Ke sebetsa sa mang se hlolehileng ho thunya ka nako e nngwe nakong ya tlhaselo?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The passage states: ""Sebetsa sa Uka se hlolehile ha se ne se supile monna wa bohlano hloohong."" This translates to ""Uka's surgery was a complete success on a man with five wounds.""
"
Ke dipapadi dife ho tse latelang tse ntshitsweng ho tswa lenaneong la diolimpiki?,"The correct answer is **B: Rakbi**.

The text states: ""Bobedi di voutetswe ho ntshwa Dipapading tsa Diolimpiki ka 2005. **Rakbi**, haholoholo yunione ya rakbi, le kolofo..."" This means rugby was selected to be included in the 2005 Olympics.

The other options are explicitly mentioned as *not* being selected:

*   **Sekwashe:** ""Sekwashe, karate le dipapadi tsa thelliso tsa di-roller di lekile ho kena lenaneong la Diolimpiki..."" (Sekwashe *tried* to get into the Olympics but didn't succeed at that time).
*   **Baseball:** ""...mme bobedi di voutetswe ho ntshwa Dipapading tsa Diolimpiki ka 2005."" (Baseball *was* selected).
*   **Karate:** ""...Sekwashe, karate..."" (Karate *tried* to get into the Olympics but didn't succeed at that time).

Therefore, only rugby is listed as having been chosen to return to the Olympics."
Ke dipapadi dife ho tse latelang tseo Komiti ya Matjhaba ya Diolimpiki e ileng ya kgetha ho di kenyelletsa dipapading?,"The correct answer is **C: Yunione ea rugby**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Rakbi, haholoholo yunione ya rakbi, le kolofo di kgethilwe kahara dipapadi tse ding tse hlano hore di sekasekelwe ho nka karolo Diolimpiking."" (Rugby, specifically union rugby, and soccer were selected among five other sports to be considered for Olympic participation.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dipapadi tsa thelliso tsa Rollers (Roller Sports):** The passage mentions roller sports *attempting* to join the Olympics, but it doesn't say they were selected.
* **B: Baseball:** Baseball and softball were both vying for Olympic inclusion, but the passage only mentions them being considered together for 2005, not being selected.
* **D: Softball:** Same as Baseball - they were considered together, but not selected.



"
Qalong Arthur Guinness o ile a hira St James' Gate Brewery ka dilemo tse kae?,"The correct answer is **C: 1759**.

The question asks when Arthur Guinness leased the St. James' Gate Brewery. The passage states: ""Ka la 24 Lwetse, 1759, Arthur Guinness o saenne lisi ya dilemo tse 9,000..."" which translates to ""On the 24th of Lease, 1759, Arthur Guinness leased a 9,000-year lease...""

Therefore, the correct answer is 1759.
"
Guinness e tlisa bonyane didolara tse dibilione tse kae selemo le selemo?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states: ""...Guinness e hodile ho ba kgwebo ya lefatshe lohle e fihlellang tjhelete e kahodimo ho 10 bilione ya di-euro (US$14.7 dibilione) selemo se seng le se seng.""  This translates to ""...Guinness has become a global business reaching over 10 billion euros (US$14.7 billion) per year.""
"
Ke dinaheng tse kae tsa European Union moo kokwana-hloko ya H5N1 e fumanweng?,"The correct answer is **C: Supa**.

The text states: ""Fora ke naha ya bosupa kahara Kopano ya Dinaha tsa Yuropo (European Union) ho ba le vaerase ena; kamora Austria, Jeremane, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece le Ithali.""  This translates to: ""France is a country in the European Union to have this virus; after Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy.""

Therefore, the H5N1 bird flu has been found in **France** (which is listed as ""supa"" in the options), along with Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy.
"
Morao-rao ya kokwana-hloko ya H5N1 e fumanwe hokae?,"The correct answer is **A: Fora**.

The text states: ""Fora ke naha ya bosupa kahara Kopano ya Dinaha tsa Yuropo (European Union) ho ba le vaerase ena; kamora Austria, Jeremane, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece le Ithali.""  This directly indicates the outbreak was found in France (Fora).
"
Haiti e qetetse neng ho kopana le lefu lena pele ho ho nama ho bakilweng ke balebedi ba kgotso?,"The correct answer is **B: Nakwana pele ho fihla mabotho.**

The text states: ""Pele ho fihla mabotho, Haiti e ne eso ka eba le mathata a amanang le bolwetse ho tloha dilemong tsa bo-1800."" (Before the arrival of the bodies, Haiti had already been struggling with disease since the 1800s.)
"
Ditshila tse tswang sebakeng sefe tse tlatseditseng ho jaleheng ha lefu lena?,"The correct answer is **B: Kampo ya UN**

The passage states: ""Ho ya ka nyewe, ditshila tse tswang kampong ya UN ha di ya tsamaiswa hantle..."" (Apparently, the diseases coming from the UN camp were not well managed...). This directly links the outbreak to the UN camp.
"
Mmuso wa Ireland o rera ho etsang?,"The correct answer is **A: Fana ka qoso tsa molao ho batlodi ba dithethefatsi**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the government is urging a speedy passage of the law to address a critical situation and public concerns.
* The Minister of Health has announced two appeals regarding the eligibility criteria for those seeking legal permission for extraordinary medicinal products, and issues related to medicines provided without authorization. This indicates the government is responding to concerns and likely adjusting procedures.
*  Option A aligns with this response. Appealing legal decisions implies a review and potentially stricter enforcement of the existing legal framework.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hlahisa melao e thata ho feta ya tumello ya dithethefatsi** - The passage doesn't mention creating *new* stricter laws, but rather addressing issues with *existing* legal frameworks.
* **C: Phumula melao mabapi le tumello ya dithethefatsi** - The passage strongly suggests the government is *not* relaxing the laws, but rather ensuring they are applied appropriately and addressing loopholes.
* **D: Etsa hore dithethefatsi di be molaong** - This is too broad. The issue isn't about making *all* medicinal products legal, but addressing problems with those granted special permission.



"
Ke eng e neng e le molaong ka nakwana Ireland?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho tlatlapa** (or abortion).

The text mentions ""molao wa palamente o lokisang boemo bona"" (a parliamentary law adjusting this situation) and refers to a ""tumello ya molao ya dintho tse amehang"" (a legal approval for extraordinary things).  The subsequent mention of ""meriana e fanweng haesale"" (abortions being provided) strongly indicates the law in question relates to abortion.
"
Motho eo ho belaellwang hore o molato o batlisiswa eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Bosenyi ba thepa**.

The passage explicitly states that Christopher Garcia, of the Los Angeles Police Department, is investigating the suspect for ""ho kena sebakeng ntle le tumello ho fapana le bosenyi ba thepa"" which translates to ""unauthorized entry in violation of property theft.""  The details about the tarpaulin are related to the method of concealing the entry, not the crime itself.
"
"Ha a fetola letshwao, mmelaellwa ha a ka a etsang?","The correct answer is **A: Fetola e nngwe ya ditlhaku tsa lona** (Change one of its letters).

The question states the letter ""O"" was changed to ""e"" using tarpaulin pieces with letters and a heart. This directly implies the suspect *changed one of its letters*. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo motataisi wa Lenyesemane Karno a sa kang a qoswa ka eona?","The correct answer is **B: Ho ratana le moithuti (Harassment of a student)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states Karno *was not* disciplined for ""ho ratana le moithuti"" (harassing a student). He was disciplined for:

* **Ho hatisa dipapatso tse kgolo dibeseng ntle le tumello (Publishing large amounts of content without permission)**
* **Ho bua leshano ka ho re ke morupelli wa sehlooho wa Senyesemane (Claiming to be a senior editor of Sesotho)**
* **Ho robile molao wa tshireletso ya khopiraete pele ho mona (Violating copyright law)**
* **Ho sebedisa 'puo ya seterateng ka phapusing ya thutelo, a ruta ka ditsebo tsa maratano dinoutsung (Using copyrighted material in educational content and teaching about partnership skills)**

Therefore, option B is the only one Karno was *not* disciplined for according to the text.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mang ya sa kang a nkwa ke Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **A: Bahahlaudi (Taxi drivers)**.

The text states: ""Ronaldo Mendoza o ile a thunya bahahlaudi ka sethunya sa moetso wa M16."" which translates to ""Ronaldo Mendoza shot taxi drivers with an M16 rifle."" 

Therefore, taxi drivers were the ones Ronaldo Mendoza shot.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke baholehuwa bafe ba sa kang ba tiiswa hore ba lokollotswe kapele?","The correct answer is **A: Bahahlaudi (Migrants)**.

The passage states: ""Ronaldo Mendoza o ile a thunya bahahlaudi ka sethunya sa moetso wa M16."" (Ronaldo Mendoza shot migrants with an M16 rifle.) and ""Batshwaruwa ba tsheletseng, ho akarelletsa bana le ba hodileng, hammoho le bo-raditshwantsho ba Mafilipino. Ho akarelletsa bana le ba hodileng, batshwaruwa ba lokollotswe pele ho nako, hammoho le bo-raditshwantsho ba Mafilipino."" (The rescued people, including children and the elderly, along with Filipino nationals, were released on time.)

The question asks who were *not* released immediately. The passage clearly states that the *migrants* were shot by Mendoza and therefore not released.  The passage mentions the release of children and the elderly, but implies the migrants were the ones targeted and not released. Therefore, the answer is migrants.
"
"Ho latela seratswana sena, ke mang ya bokellang mesaeno ya batho ba tshehetsang ho ngodiswa ka molao manyalo a batho ba bong bo tshwanang Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Baipelaetsi (Advocates)**.

The text states: ""Baipelaetsi ba tshepa ho bokeletsa lengolo la ditletlebo le sainilweng ke batho ba 1.2 milione ho le teka Sebokeng sa Naha ka Pudungwana."" (Advocates hope to submit a petition signed by 1.2 million people to be considered at the National Congress in Pudongwana.)

This clearly indicates that advocates are pushing for the legalization of same-sex marriage.
"
Baipelaetsi ba tla fana ka kopo ya bona ho mang?,"The correct answer is **C: Lekgotla la Naha la Brazil**.

The text states: ""Baipelaetsi ba tshepa ho bokeletsa lengolo la ditletlebo le sainilweng ke batho ba 1.2 milione ho le teka Sebokeng sa Naha ka Pudungwana."" (The petitioners hope to submit a petition signed by 1.2 million people to be reviewed at the National Congress in Brasilia.)

Therefore, the petition will be submitted to the National Congress of Brazil.
"
"Ho latela tlaleho ya Armand Versace, ho ile ha etsahalang ka ho toba pele letshwele le qala ho etsa ho hong ka lebaka la boemo ba lehodimo?","The correct answer is **C: Ho ne ho e-na le meya e matla.**

Here's why:

Armand Versace's statement says: ""Metsotso e mehlano kamora ho qaleha ha pontsho moya wa qala ho tsukutla...yaba pula ya qala, empa ka matla hona hoo e neng e otla letlalo la hao jwalo ka ho hlajwa ke nalete..."" (Five minutes after the rain started, the wind began to blow... then the storm started, but with great force, it seemed to tear off the roof like a whirlwind...) This clearly indicates strong winds were the immediate consequence of the rain's onset.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho ile ha qala ho na sefako:** While there was a flood later, the initial event described is the strong wind.
*   **B: Pontsho e ne e le morao metsotso e mehlano:** The time frame is mentioned, but the key event is the strong wind.
*   **D: O ile a lahlehelwa ke tlaleho ya setho sa lelapa:** While he was helped by his aunt and her brother, this wasn't the *initial* event caused by the storm.

Therefore, the strong winds are the primary event linked to the rain's onset according to Armand Versace's account."
"Ho latela Versace, meya e matla ka ho fetisisa e qadile neng?","The correct answer is **A: Metsotso e mmalwa ka mora hore pontsho e qale**.

Armand Versace says: ""Metsotso e mehlano kamora ho qaleha ha pontsho moya wa qala ho tsukutla..."" (Five minutes after the rain started, the wind began to blow...).  The wind reached 70km/h *after* the rain started, but the strongest winds occurred ""metsotso e mehlano kamora ho qaleha ha pontsho"" (five minutes after the rain started).
"
"Pele ho Fred, ho ne ho tlalehilwe difefo tse kae tse kholo ka botjhabela tsa 35°W?","The correct answer is **A: Ha ho letho**.

Here's why: The question states that Fred is the *largest* tropical cyclone ever recorded at that longitude (35°W).  It also says he's the third largest overall. Therefore, there were no other tropical cyclones of comparable size previously recorded at that specific longitude.
"
"Ha Fred a ne a le haufi le dihlekehleke tsa Cape Verde, e ne e leba nqa efe?","The correct answer is **D: Leboya-bophirimela**.

The question states that Fred was heading west (levoya-bophirimela) when he was near the Cape Verde Islands. Therefore, he was looking towards the west."
Ke efe ho tse latelang e nang le lebelo le potlakileng ho feta pele ho yona?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mabelo a 802.11n a potlaka haholwanyane ho feta a fetileng pele ho yona ka kgubu ya lebelo le dumelwang hore ke 600Mbit/s.""  This means 802.11n has a faster speed than the previous standards (802.11a, b, and g).
"
Ho hlokahala eng hore 802.11n e be morao e tsamaellane le 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Diradio tse pedi**.

Here's why:

* **802.11n supports both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands.**  The question states this directly.
* **To backward-compatible with older standards like 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g, the 802.11n device *needs to have radios that can operate on both frequencies*.**  This allows it to communicate with devices that only support older protocols on the older bands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mabelo a potlakileng haholo (Very high speed):** While 600Mbit/s is faster, it's not *required* for backward compatibility. The ability to operate on multiple frequencies is the core requirement.
* **B: Bokgoni ba 802.11b ho sebetsa ho 5.0Ghz (The ability of 802.11b to operate on 5.0GHz):** 802.11b only operates on the 2.4GHz band.  It can't operate on 5.0GHz.
* **C: Tshebetso ya 600Mbit/s (600Mbit/s operation):**  Again, the speed is a feature of 802.11n but not the *reason* for backward compatibility.



"
Mohapiwa khau ya khauta wa Diolimpiki o ne a lokela ho sesa ho ya Dipapaling tsa Commonwealth tse kae?,"The correct answer is **B: A mararo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sesesi sa mpodi wa medale ya kgauta sa Diolimpiki se ne se lokela ho sesa mabelong a 100m le 200m a ""freestyle"" le mabelong a mararo a neheletsano a Dipapadi tsa Commonwealth..."" which translates to ""...the swimmer who won an Olympic gold medal was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and **three** events at the Commonwealth Games...""
"
Hobaneng mohapi wa kgauta ya Diolimpiki a ne a sa nwa meriana bakeng sa bohloko ba hae?,"The correct answer is **D: Ha e dumellwe ho Dipapadi tsa Commonwealth**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ha a kgona ho sebedisa dithethefatsi tse hlokehang hore a fedise ho opelwa ha hae hobane di ne di thibetswe Dipapading."" This means the reason he couldn't compete was because his necessary equipment was prohibited by the Commonwealth Games. The passage doesn't say he was afraid, it was the restriction of the equipment that prevented him.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka beng e ile ya baka pherekano mabapi le mosebetsi wa tshisinyeho ya lefatshe?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlaleho tse tswang Ofising ya Icelandic Meteorological**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ofisi ya Icelendic Meteorological le yona e ile ya tlaleha ho se na tshisinyeho ya lefatshe e bileng teng tikolohong ya Hekla dihoreng tse 48 tse fetileng."" This directly indicates that the Meteorological Office's reports contributed to the questioning of the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Boteng ba maru a lefifi:** The passage mentions ""maru a matsho a neng a sa amahanywe le ketsahalo ya ho foqoha ha seretse se tjhesang a ile a tlalehwa mesikong ya thaba,"" but this is about the *lack* of connection between the tremors and the eruption, not a cause of the questioning.
* **C: Mmapa wa tshisinyeho ya lefatshe wa matjhaba:** The passage states that the global earthquake map showed *no* recent earthquakes in the Hekla area. This *contradicted* the observed tremors and led to the questioning, not the other way around.
* **D: Ketsahalo e tlalehilweng dibakeng tse ding tsa Iceland:** While the eruption might have been reported elsewhere in Iceland, the passage specifically highlights the Icelandic Meteorological Office's reports as being relevant to the questioning of the earthquake.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**."
"Ho latela seratswana, phetoho ya mokgahlelo e etsahetse neng?","The correct answer is **C: Ka la 10 Hlakubele**.

The passage states: ""Ketsahalo ya tshitshinyeho ya lefatshe e ikgethileng e lebisitseng ho tjhentjheng ha sebopeho e etsahetse ka la 10 Hlakubele..."" (The independent earthquake that led to ground rupture occurred on August 10th...). This directly answers the question about when the change occurred.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang tse mabapi le dipatlisiso tsa kgwedi ya Chandrayaan-1 eo e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho ntshwa ha sathelaete ho ile ha atleha**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) successfully crashed into the Moon near the south pole. This implies that the satellite *did* reach the Moon and perform its mission. Therefore, the satellite did not fail.
* Options A, B, and D are all supported by the passage.  It mentions the MIP's speed and its successful data gathering, indicating scientific instruments. It also states that the satellite was painted with the Indian flag.



Therefore, the statement that the satellite failed is the incorrect one.
"
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e hlalosang phuputso ya kgwedi ka nepo?,"The correct answer is **A: E ile ya dula haufi le palo e ka leboya ya Kgwedi (It stayed close to the desired location of the Moon).**

Here's why:

* The passage states the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) ""tsubelletseng ho parola lepatlelo la kgwedi ka lebelo la dikhilomitara tse 1.5 ka motsotswana...mme sa swahlamana ha se tsorama haufi le ntlha e ka borwa ya Kgwedi (south pole)."" This means the probe successfully reached the intended area near the south pole.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho fihla ha yona ka kotsi ho ile ha atleha (Its arrival did not happen safely):** The passage explicitly says ""sa swahlamana ha se tsorama haufi le ntlha e ka borwa ya Kgwedi,"" indicating a safe landing.
* **C: E ile ya ntshwa ho sathelaete e nkang batho (It was ejected from a spacecraft carrying people):** The passage refers to the MIP as a ""hloohwana ya kgwedi"" (Moon Impact Probe), not something ejected from a spacecraft carrying people.
* **D: E ne e nkile disebediswa tse pedi tsa bohlokwa (It carried two important devices):**  The passage says it ""phethahatsa disebediswa tsa bohlokwa tsa saense,"" which implies *at least* one important scientific device, but doesn't specify it carried two. It also mentions a photographic image of India.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke tekanyo efe ya tshireletso kgahlanong le lefu lena e tla kengwa tshebetsong qetellong?","The correct answer is **C: Vaksine tsa encephalitis**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dibutlolwana tse dimilione tse mmalwa tsa vaksine ya lefu la encephalitis le tsona di tshepisitswe ke mmuso, e leng se tla thusa ho lokisetsa makalana a bophelo bo botle bakeng sa selemo se tlang."" (Millions of doses of encephalitis vaccine have also been promised by the government, which will help prepare for better health outcomes next year.)

While the other options are mentioned as part of the response to the outbreak, the vaccine is specifically highlighted as a key preventative measure.
"
Lefu lena le fetela bathong jwang?,"The correct answer is **A: Menwang**.

The passage states: ""Lefu lena le tsamaiswa ke dikolobe, ebe jwale le fetisetswa bathong ke **menwang**.""  (This disease is transmitted by ticks, and now it is transmitted to humans by **ticks**.)
"
Ho hloleha ha kahlolo ya bobedi ho ka ba le diphello dife?,"The correct answer is **B: Tokelo ya kamoso ya mekgatlo ya batho ba bong bo tshwanang (Future rights of equal organizations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the amendment, intended to prevent discriminatory practices, *might* open the door for future discriminatory practices. This directly relates to the future rights of organizations and individuals who advocate for equality.  If the amendment weakens the protections against discrimination, it could jeopardize those rights in the future.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhahlobo ya hang-hang ya HJR-3 (Immediate review of HJR-3):** The passage says HJR-3 will be reviewed later, not immediately.
*   **C: Seboka sa molao oa tshohanyetso (Equality law framework):** While the amendment *affects* equality law, it's not a framework itself. It's a specific amendment to a law.
*   **D: Thibelo ya manyalo a batho ba bong bo tshwanang (Prevention of discrimination against equal people):**  The passage suggests the amendment might *undo* that prevention, not ensure it.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, kahlolo ya bobedi e hlakotswe neng?","The correct answer is **B: Ka-2011**.

The text states: ""Sehlomathiso se rerilweng se se ntse se fetisitsitswe ke matlo a mabedi a Palamente ka 2011."" which translates to ""The proposed law was passed by both houses of Parliament in 2011.""  The question asks *when* the second reading was removed, and the text specifies the entire proposed law was passed in 2011.
"
"""Dipampiri tsa """"Panama"""" di ne di phatlalatswa ho bo-mang?""","The correct answer is **B: Moqolotsi wa ditaba**.

The text states: ""Koranta ya Borithani The Guardian e boletse hore Deutsche Bank..."" (The British newspaper The Guardian reported that Deutsche Bank...). This indicates that the Panama Papers were revealed by the press, specifically The Guardian.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mang eo khatiso ya Brithani e ileng ya bolela hore o laola dikhamphani tse ngata tse neng di sebediswa ho pata leruo?","The correct answer is **C: Bank ya Deutsche**.

The text states: ""Koranta ya Borithani The Guardian e boletse hore Deutsche Bank e laola ho ka bang karolo ya nngwe borarong ya dikhampani tsa robaditsweng (""""shell company"""") tse 1200 tse sebediswang ho fihlella sena.""  This directly links Deutsche Bank to controlling a large number of shell companies used for tax evasion.
"
Ke kotsi efe ho tse latelang ya sefofane e bolaileng batho ka ho fetisisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Sefofane se ile sa swahlamana ha se leba Iran se tswa Armenia.**

Here's why:

* The question asks for the *most* dangerous plane crash.
* Option C describes the crash that resulted in the highest death toll (168 people).
* The other options describe crashes with fewer fatalities (3, 5, and a smaller number of injuries).

Therefore, the crash that occurred when the plane was *coming from Armenia to Iran* was the most dangerous.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng lebaka la bongata ba dikotsi tsa sefofane tse etsahalang Iran?,"The correct answer is **A: Sehlopha sa khale sa difofane tsa setjhaba le tsa sesole** (Old fleet of public and private vehicles).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the old fleet of vehicles is poorly maintained.** This is a direct contributing factor to the increased accidents.
* **The passage mentions a lack of availability of new vehicles due to restrictions.**  This is another direct contributing factor.
* **The passage mentions government restrictions on purchasing new vehicles.** This contributes to the problem of an old, poorly maintained fleet.
* **While the passage doesn't explicitly say the vehicles aren't maintained well, the accidents suggest poor maintenance is a strong possibility.** This makes option D a plausible contributing factor.

Therefore, the *old fleet* isn't a *cause* of the accidents; it's a *result* of the problems highlighted in the passage.  The other options are directly mentioned as factors contributing to the dangers.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kenyelletswang tlalehong ya Sehlopha sa Phuputso sa Iraq?,"The correct answer is **B: Phatlalatso ya hore ka diphetoho tse itseng, pefo e ntseng e eketseha Iraq e ka qojwa.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the report emphasizes the need for diplomatic action to **protect Iraqi civilians** (option C).
* The report mentions the **current plan of the government** regarding Iraq (option A).
* The report discusses **open dialogue and communication with the United States** regarding the plan for the ""Northern Campaign"" (option D).
* **However, the text does not mention the possibility of increased conflict or the release of prisoners as a result of changes.** Option B introduces a scenario not present in the report's content.



Therefore, option B is the only one that is *not* included in the Iraq Advisory Council report."
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya kgothaletswa ke Sehlopha sa Phuputso sa Iraq tlalehong ya yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Hore ho phatlalatswe tiiso ya ho emisa pefo e ntseng e hola (That a guarantee has been issued to halt the growing conflict).**

The text explicitly states that the Iraqi Council of Representatives **did not** find it reassuring that a guarantee had been issued to halt the growing conflict.  The report emphasizes the lack of assurances and the potential for further escalation.

The other options *were* advocated for:

*   **B: Phetoho e potlakileng ya tataiso (Swift change in strategy):** The report advocates for an immediate change in the government's approach to Iraq.
*   **C: Tshebediso ya dipuisano tse bulehileng (Operational open dialogue):** The report begins by mentioning the ongoing dialogue and communication with the United States.
*   **D: Ho thehwa ha mohato o motjha wa bodiplomate (The adoption of a new diplomatic step):**  The report strongly advocates for diplomatic action.



"
"Ho ya ka mapolesa, ke mang ya neng a nkwa e le monna ya letsohong le letona la Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Ke-Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Sepolesa se itse Lo Piccolo o ne a itlhomme pele hobane e ne e le letsoho le letona la Provenzano..."" which translates to ""The police themselves knew that Lo Piccolo was the right-hand man of Provenzano...""
"
"Ho latela dintlha tse fanweng serapeng, sesosa sa lefu la Falcone e ne e le sefe?","The correct answer is **A: O ile a bolawa nakong ya ntwa e neng e tsamaiswa ke Riina.**

The text states: ""…kwa 1992 ha a ne a fedisa ntwa e qhojwang ke Riina kgahlanong le profensi ena e nkileng maphelo a diqhoku tsa Mafia Giovanni Falcone le Paolo Borsellino…"". This translates to ""...in 1992 when he ended the war waged by Riina against this province, which took the lives of Mafia victims Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino…"".  Therefore, Falcone and Borsellino were killed during the war waged by Riina.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng e nngwe ya dikgau tsa Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **B: Modulasetulo wa Komiti ya All Japan Judo Federation**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states he *was* the president of the All Japan Judo Federation, but it doesn't mention it as one of his achievements.
* The text mentions he was a two-time Olympic gold medalist, a two-time World Champion, and a Judo expert.  These are all listed as accomplishments.



Therefore, the option that *was not* one of his achievements is being the president of the All Japan Judo Federation.
"
Ke hokae moo Iwasaki a ileng a kgona ho qoba ho etsa dikano?,"The correct answer is **A: Japane**. 

The passage states: ""...a phonyoha lenyalo naheng ya Nepal mme a tshwarwa naheng ya India."" This means he was injured in Nepal and taken to India. It *doesn't* say where he recovered and was able to overcome his difficulties. The question asks where he was able to *quit* (etsa dikano - give up) which implies recovery. Since the passage doesn't mention him giving up anywhere but says he was taken to India, and the context suggests he recovered *after* being in Nepal, the most logical place he would have been able to overcome his difficulties is his home country, **Japan**.

Therefore, A is the best answer, even though it's not explicitly stated.
"
Ke mang ya ileng a hlasela Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntja (Dog)**.

The text states that Iwasaki was attacked by a ""lefu la marabi"" (milk-white animal), which in this context is understood to be a **dog**.
"
Alonso o qetile lebelo la hae neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka mora hore Schumacher a kgaotse lebelo la hae**.

The text states: ""Mphato wa sehlopha sa habo Fernando Alonso o ne a eteletse pele boholo ba mojaho, empa o kgaoditse hang kamorao ho kgefutso (pit-stop) ya hae, mohlomong ka lebaka la lebidi la kapele le neng le kentswe hampe. Michael Schumacher o qetetse mojaho wa hae hanyane kamora Alonso, hobane saspenshene ya hae e ne e senyehile ka lebaka la tshubuhlellano ya semphete-ke-o-fete nakong ya mojaho."" This indicates Alonso finished after Schumacher.
"
Ke eng e entseng hore Schumacher a khaotse lebelo la hae pele ho nako?,"The correct answer is **A: O ile a lahlehelwa ke taolo ya koloi ya hae.**

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher o qetetse mojaho wa hae hanyane kamora Alonso, hobane saspenshene ya hae e ne e senyehile ka lebaka la tshubuhlellano ya semphete-ke-o-fete nakong ya mojaho.""  This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso, because his suspension broke due to a collision during the race.""

The options are:

*   **A: O ile a lahlehelwa ke taolo ya koloi ya hae** (He was disqualified by his car's control) - While the text doesn't explicitly say ""disqualified,"" it implies a problem with the car *itself* that led to his retirement, and a broken suspension certainly would. This is the best fit.
*   **B: Ho thulana le Alonso** (Competing with Alonso) - The text doesn't suggest this was the cause.
*   **C: Tshenyo ya mabidi e bakilweng ke Fisichella** (A collision caused by Fisichella) - The text says a collision occurred *during the race*, which is implied. This is a possible cause of the suspension failure.
*   **D: Tshenyo ya ho emiswa ha koloi** (A pit stop collision) - The text mentions a pit stop, but it does not describe a collision during the pit stop.

While a collision caused by Fisichella is possible, the broken suspension is the direct reason Schumacher had to retire and option A is the closest. The sentence “saspenshene ya hae e ne e senyehile” (his suspension broke) means the car itself caused him to retire, regardless of whether Fisichella was involved. However, if we assume the collision with Fisichella caused the suspension to break, then C would also be technically correct. However, since option A is a better description, that would be the best choice.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mosebetsi wa mang ho beha beile bakeng sa ba tshwarwang?","The correct answer is **A: Ofisiri e tshwarang (The arresting officer)**.

The text states: ""Mokhomishenara o teka beile, haeba e fanwa, mme o tiisa semolao diqoso tse hlahletsweng ke moofisiri ya **tshwereng batho**."" (The Commissioner proposes, if granted, and validates the charges issued by the **officer who arrested them**.)

Therefore, the arresting officer is responsible for issuing the charges.
"
"Ho ya ka taelo ya nakwana ya thibelo e boletsweng serapeng, ba tshwerweng ba tlameha ho ba le eng e le hore ba ka tshwarwa nako e telele ho feta dihora tse 24?","The correct answer is **C: Diqoso tsa molao tse fanweng ke Moahloli Glynn**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mokhomishenara o teka beile, haeba e fanwa, mme o tiisa semolao diqoso tse hlahletsweng ke moofisiri ya tshwereng batho."" (The Commissioner has stipulated, if granted, and endorses the legal complaints issued by the officer who arrested them.)

This indicates that legal complaints (diqoso tsa molao) from the arresting officer are required for a longer detention period than 24 hours. The other options are not mentioned as requirements in the passage.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke lebaka lefeng le sa sebediswang ho hlalosa ho thibelwa hwa dikgetho-pheto?","The correct answer is **B: Khanyetsano ya molaotheo (Refusal of the law)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Badiplomate ba itse ba fumane ho se hlake ho lekaneng molaotheong wa Afghanistan ho tsheheditseng hore dikgetho-pheto ha di hlokehe."" This translates to ""Diplomats know they found insufficient clarity in Afghan law to justify the need for changes."" Therefore, the refusal or lack of clarity in the law is the reason cited for the obstruction of the reforms.
"
Hobaneng baemedi ba dinaha ba bone dikgetho-phetho di sa hlokahale?,"The correct answer is **A: Ene ele kgahlanong le molaotheo (It is against the law)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Badiplomate ba itse ba fumane ho se hlake ho lekaneng molaotheong wa Afghanistan ho tsheheditseng hore dikgetho-pheto ha di hlokehe."" (Diplomats knew they found it insufficiently clear in Afghan law to justify the need for changes). This directly indicates the reason diplomats believed the changes were unnecessary is because they were illegal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho ne ho na le menyetla ya mathata a tshireletso (There were security problems).** While security problems *might* be a reason to consider changes, the passage doesn't state this as the reason diplomats believed the changes were unnecessary.
* **C: Molaotheo o ne o le ntlhla-pedi (The law was outdated).** The passage focuses on the law not being *clear*, not necessarily outdated.
* **D: Ditjeo tsa dikgetho di ne di le boima (The terms of the changes were difficult).** The passage doesn't mention the difficulty of the terms.



"
Ke mang ya fanang ka ditshebeletso tsa kabo ya toka ho FATA?,"The correct answer is **C: Mmuso wa Pakistan**.

The text states: ""Presidente ya Pakistane e thontse 'Diejente tsa Sepolotiki' ho busa FATA... Diejente tsena di ikarabella bakeng sa ho fana ka puso le ditshebeletso tsa toka tlasa Athikele ya 247 ya Molaotheo wa Pakistane."" This translates to ""The President of Pakistan appointed 'Political Agents' to govern FATA... These agents are responsible for providing governance and essential services under Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution."" Therefore, the government of Pakistan, through the appointed agents, is responsible for providing these services.
"
Ke polelo efeng eo e seng nnete ka “Babuelli Ba-sepolotiki” ba FATA?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba itshetlehile ka molatheo wa Pakistan** (They are autonomous under Pakistani law).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""President of Pakistan appointed 'Political Agents' to administer FATA, who have been exercising self-governance under Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution.""  This means the Political Agents are *not* completely independent.  They operate *under* the framework of the Pakistani Constitution.

Let's look at why the other options are likely true based on the passage:

* **A: Ba fana ka ditshebeletso tsa kabo ya toka** (They provide basic civic services): The passage explicitly states they provide governance and essential services.
* **B: Ba kgethuoe kgethilwe ke Moporesitente wa Pakistan** (They are appointed by the President of Pakistan): The passage says the President appointed them.
* **D: Ba na le taolo e felletseng dikarolong tse ding** (They have full control over other areas): While not stated explicitly, the context of self-governance implies some degree of control within their designated area.

Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the passage is that they are completely autonomous under Pakistani law.



"
Emma Stone o ne a thonyeditswe khau efeng?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebapadi sehlwahlwa sa mosadi (Best Actress)**.

The text states: ""Gosling le Stone ba thonyeditswe Sebapadi se Hlwahlwa ka ho Fetisisa sa Monna le sa Mosadi."" This translates to ""Gosling and Stone were awarded Best Actor and Best Actress."" Therefore, Emma Stone was awarded Best Actress.
"
Filimi ene e sa thonyetswa khau efeng?,"The correct answer is **B: Boqapi ba Ditswantsho bo Hlwahlwa (Best Picture)**.

The question asks what award the film *wasn't* nominated for. The text states the film *was* nominated for Best Picture and several other categories.  ""Boqapi ba Ditswantsho bo Hlwahlwa"" is the Sesotho translation for Best Picture.

Therefore, B is the incorrect answer because the passage explicitly lists Best Picture as one of the categories the film *was* nominated for.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efeng esetseng e sebetsa kamora ho reketla hwa lefatshe?","The correct answer is **A: Diqhomane kaofela setsing sa Shika ya Hokuriku**.

Here's why:

The text states that the directors of the No. 1 and 2 power plants at Hokuriku Electric Power Co.'s Shika power plant were injured. It also mentions that the power plants at Kashiwazaki Kariwa were operating normally.  The text then describes disruptions *after* the earthquake: lack of water, power outages, road damage, and railway service suspensions.  Therefore, the Shika power plant's operations are the most directly linked to events *following* the earthquake and the injuries.  Option A is the only option that accurately reflects that.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe e senyehileng ka lebaka la ho reketla hwa lefatshe?","The correct answer is **C: Ditsela tse ding (Other roads)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ditsela tse ding di senyehile"" which translates to ""Other roads have been damaged.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efeng e sa kenyeletswang tokomaneng eo?","The correct answer is **D: Dikhulakhulano tsa madiboho** (Clash of arms/armed conflict).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions future status of Jerusalem and the Jordan River Valley. It also details Israel's demand for control of the Jordan River Valley for five years while the PA doesn't agree to such a handover.  However, the passage does *not* mention armed conflict. While the situation is inherently volatile and *could* lead to conflict, it isn't specifically listed as one of the key points of negotiation.
"
Ke ntho efeng ho tse latelang eo eseng tse ding tsa ditlhoko tsa Palesetina?,"The correct answer is **D: Dilemo tse hlano tsa boteng ba masole Phuleng ya Jorotane.**

Here's why:

* The question asks which is *not* a Palestinian concern.
* The passage explicitly states that Israel wants a six-day guarantee of the Jordan River Valley.
* Options A, B, and C all directly relate to Palestinian concerns as outlined in the passage:
    * **A: Madiboho ho ipapisitswe le maemo a pele ho ntwa** (Settlements in the occupied territories) are a key Palestinian concern.
    * **B: Boteng ba masole Phuleng ya Jorotane** (Military control of the Jordan River Valley) is a major point of contention.
    * **C: Dikarabo mabapi le bokamoso ba Jerusalema** (Answers about the future of Jerusalem) is a critical issue for Palestinians.
* **D: Dilemo tse hlano tsa boteng ba masole Phuleng ya Jorotane** (Six-day military control of the Jordan River Valley) is something *Israel* wants, not a Palestinian concern. The passage clarifies that Israel is seeking a six-day guarantee of this area.

Therefore, the only option that doesn't represent a Palestinian concern is D.



"
Ma o ithutetse molao naheng efeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Amerika**.

The passage states explicitly: ""O hlahetse Hong Kong, Ma o ithutile **New York University le Harvard Law School** mme o kile a ba le karete ya modudi wa nako yohle wa Amerika (""""green card"""")."" 

This clearly indicates Ma studied in the United States.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke bobuelli ba naha efeng bo thusitseng Ma hore a hlole dikgetho?","The correct answer is **A: Amerika**.

The text states Ma studied at New York University and Harvard Law School, and held a US green card. This indicates a connection and potential support from the United States.
"
"Jwalo ka ha ho hlalositswe seratswaneng, Carolyn Wilson o sebeleditse mang pele a tloha toropong?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**. 

The text states: ""Badudi ba qala ho arolelana se ba hlahetseng, bongata ba malapa a amehang a qadile ho lemoha hore Carolyn Wilson wa **OHA** o utswitse didipositi tsa tshireletso tsa bona, mme a balehela sebakeng se seng."" This directly indicates that Carolyn Wilson from OHA left the country first.
"
"Ho mabelo a makoloi a mane a setseng sehleng sena, ke mang ya boemong ba bone ho Bompodi ba Boqhobi?","The answer is **A: Hamlin**.

The question asks who was in the top 5 positions after the last 4 races. The text states: ""Borarong, Hamlin o na le dintlha tse mashome a mabedi kamorao, empa tse hlano kapele ho Bowyer."" This indicates Hamlin was in 4th place.

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

*   **B: Kahne** - Kahne finished in 6th place.
*   **C: Stewart** - Stewart finished in 10th place.
*   **D: Bowyer** - Bowyer finished in 5th place, not 4th.

Therefore, the correct answer is Hamlin."
"Ho latela tlhodisano e boletsweng seratswaneng, Kahne o na le dintlha tse kae tsa Bompodi ba Boqhobi?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kahne le Truex, Jr. ba bohlanong le botsheletseng ka dintlha tse 2,220 le 2,207 ka tlhahlamano."" This means Kahne has 2,220 points.
"
"Ho latela seratswna, ke makgetlo a makae ao batho ba boneng majwe a tswang sebakeng (meteorites) ao hamorao a netefaditsweng ele a mofuta wa Mars?","The correct answer is **A: Makgetlo a leshome**.

The text states: ""A leshome le metso e mehlano a majwe ana a nkuwa e le a tswang maqhetswaneng a metheoraete ka Phupu selemong se fetileng."" This translates to ""Ten and five of these meteorites were taken from meteorite fragments last September.""
"
"Jwalo ka ha ho boletswe seratswaneng, ke eng se o e leng nnete ka majoe ao a fumanweng a mofuta wa Mars?","The correct answer is **D: Di 34**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Hara dimetheoraete tse ka bang 24,000 tse tsejwang hore di wetse Lefatsheng, ke feela tse ka bang 34 tse netefaditsweng hore di thomehile Mars.""  This means only 34 meteorites are confirmed to have originated from Mars.
* **Option A** is incorrect because the passage says the 34 were found in the *last* Phupu (June), not that *all* were found there.
* **Option B** is incorrect because 24,000 is the *total* number of meteorites found to have landed on Earth, not the number confirmed to be from Mars.
* **Option C** is incorrect because the passage states they are priced *higher* than gold, not *like* gold.



"
Schumacher o ile a tlohela mosebetsi neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Kamora ho nka sebaka sa Felipe Massa**.

Here's why:

* The first sentence states Schumacher was supposed to replace Felipe Massa after Massa was injured. 
* The passage then mentions Massa was injured in 2009, leading to him missing the rest of the season. 
* Therefore, Schumacher took Massa's place *because* of Massa's injury.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kamora ho tjhaisa hwa Felipe Massa** - This is not quite right. While Schumacher *replaced* Massa, the phrasing ""tjhaisa hwa"" (to replace) is less accurate than saying he took his place.
* **B: Kamora hoba mpodi wa bosupa** -  The passage mentions a crash in 2006, but it's not directly linked to Schumacher leaving his position. The main reason was Massa's injury.
* **D: Mafelong a sehla sa selemo sa 2009** - While Massa missed the rest of the 2009 season, Schumacher's position change happened *because* of the injury earlier in the year. He didn't just leave at the end of the season.



"
Massa o lemetse neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya Grand Prix**.

The text states: ""MoBrazil enwa o ne a lemetse hloohong kamora ho thula nakong ya Hungarian Grand Prix ya 2009."" This translates to ""In Brazil, he was injured in the head after crashing during the Hungarian Grand Prix of 2009.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, tukiso ee e tlo ama AOL jwang?","The correct answer is **A: Dipalo tsa basebedisi ba AOL di ka nna tsa nyoloha (AOL's user numbers could decline).**

Here's why:

The paragraph states that AOL's dominance in the instant messaging (IM) market is being threatened. It mentions that Yahoo! and Microsoft have larger user bases combined than AOL.  The closing sentence directly states that this trend could lead to AOL's user numbers declining.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: AOL e tla ba yona feela khampani e tla matlafatsa mmaraka wa IM (AOL will be the only company to boost the IM market).** The passage doesn't suggest AOL will be the sole company doing so.
*   **C: Dipalo tsa basebedisi ba AOL di tla hlodisana le tsa Yahoo le Microsoft (AOL's user numbers will equalize with Yahoo and Microsoft).**  The passage implies the opposite – AOL's numbers are *not* equal and are potentially decreasing.
*   **D: AOL ha e sa tla sebediswa Amerika (AOL will no longer be used in America).** The passage focuses on the IM market and doesn't suggest AOL will cease operations in the US altogether.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the text is that AOL's user base could decline."
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efeng e ka nnang ya feela ho latela tukiso ee e ntjha?","The correct answer is **C: Bolokolohi ba AOL ba ho ntlafatsa mmaraka ka mokoka wa bona (AOL's ability to grow the market on its own).**

Here's why:

The paragraph states that AOL's growth has relied on its extensive US user base.  The new trend suggests this reliance is diminishing because Yahoo! and Microsoft have larger user bases combined. This means AOL's *independent* ability to grow the market by itself is likely to be limited. Options A, B, and D are either too broad or not directly implied by the passage's focus on AOL's internal growth strategy in light of changing market dynamics.
"
"Ke batho ba bakae ba bolauweng tlhaselong eo, bao eseng mapolesa?","The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The question states: ""Ofisi ya mmusisi e itse ba leshome le metso e robong ba batho ba lemetseng e bile mapolesa."" (The governor's office identified 15 people who were injured and included police officers.)

The question also states: ""Itse ba belaella molwanedi wa Daesh (ISIL) bakeng sa boikarabello ba tlhaselo."" (Police believe a Daesh (ISIL) member is responsible for the attack.)

It further mentions ""ho lematsa batho ba bang ba fetang mashome a mabedi"" (injured more than 20 people).

From this, we know there were more than 20 people injured in total, and 15 of them were police officers. Therefore, the number of non-police people injured is:  (Total injured) - (Police injured) = >20 - 15 = >5. The question says ""lematsa batho ba bang ba fetang mashome a mabedi,"" meaning more than 20 were injured in total. The statement, ""Ofisi ya mmusisi e itse ba leshome le metso e robong ba batho ba lemetseng e bile mapolesa"" means 15 people were police officers. If we assume that those 15 people were the only police injured and that the rest were non-police, we have: (more than 20 total injured) - 15 (police injured) = >5 non-police injured. Since only 19 are given as an option, and we know more than 20 were injured total, and 15 were police officers, the non-police injured were therefore 20 - 15 = 5. Therefore the options are incorrect.

However, if we take the phrasing ""ho lematsa batho ba bang ba fetang mashome a mabedi,"" to mean ""injuring more than 20 people,"" we can assume that the 15 police officers were part of the group that was injured more than 20 people.  Therefore, to get the number of non-police injured, we subtract the police injured from the total injured: more than 20 - 15 = more than 5. The only option that is greater than 5 is 19.

Therefore, the closest answer is 19.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{19}$"
Ke mang ya tlalehileng melaellwa wa thlaselo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ofisi ya mmusisi**.

The text states: ""Ofisi ya mmusisi e itse ba leshome le metso e robong ba batho ba lemetseng e bile mapolesa."" (The governor's office identified 58 people injured, including police officers.) This indicates the governor's office is the one who identified the injured.
"
"Ho latela maemo a tlholo ya bomemo bo hodimo ya Florida, Mitt Romney o hapile eng?","The correct answer is **D: Diperesente tse 46 tsa divoutu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mitt Romney o hapile diphesente tse 46 tsa divoutu."" This translates to ""Mitt Romney won 46 percent of the vote.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo e kae lekgolong ya divoutu eo Gingrich a bileng le yona dikgethong tsa mathomo?","The correct answer is **B: Diperesente tse 32**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sepikara sa mehleng sa Ntlo ya Baemedi ya Palamente ya naha ya U.S. Newt Gingrich se hlahile bobeding ka diphesente tse 32."" This translates to ""U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich received 32 percent in the primaries.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang a sa tswelang pele dikgethong kamora sephetho sa seboka?","The correct answer is **A: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Kamora hore diphetho di kene, Gingrich a thoholetsa Santorum..."" This means Gingrich came in first place.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang a buileng ka mokgethwa e mong kamora sephetho sa seboka?","The correct answer is **D: Perry**.

The text states: ""Perry...said he would 'return to Texas to assess the immediate aftermath of today's results, to determine if there is a path forward for him in this race'..."" This indicates Perry spoke about his future in the race after the results.

While Gingrich spoke about Santorum and Romney, and Bachmann announced she was ending her campaign, Perry's statement directly addresses his own future path.
"
Ke sebaka sefeng se le seng feela seo lenaneo le ileng la hlaiswa pele ho selemo sa 2015?,"The correct answer is **C: Seyalemoya sa AstroNet**.

The text states: ""Ha morao selemong sa 2015, TogiNet e thehile AstroNet Radio jwalo ka seteishene sa tlatsetso."" This directly indicates that AstroNet Radio was established in 2015.
"
Seyalemoya se ne se hlalosa lenaneo ele la morethetho ofeng?,"The correct answer is **C: Wa kgale**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the program is a ""reimagining of ancient radio and theater combined with a brilliantly new solution!"" This clearly points to a historical connection.
* It mentions the program being broadcast on a ""long-standing internet radio station"" and its origins in 2015, further emphasizing its history.
* The phrase ""ancient radio and theater"" directly indicates a historical theme.

Therefore, the program's description leans towards a **wa kgale (historical)** tone.
"
David Headley o ile a fumana eng e ileng ya thusa tlhaselo entsweng ke marabele?,"The correct answer is **A: Tlhaiso-leseding (Intelligence)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bosekaoti le pokeletso ya tlhahisoleseding ba David Headley bo ne bo thusitse ho kgonahatsa tshebetso e etswang ke banna ba borasethunya ba 10..."" This means David Headley's intelligence gathering helped facilitate the attacks.
"
Marabele a sebedisitse mofuta ofeng wa ho tsamaya ho ya Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Seketswana (Train)**.

The question states: ""Bahlasedi ba Mumbai ba fihlile ka **seketswana** ka la 26 Pudungwana..."" which translates to ""The attackers arrived in Mumbai by **train** on the 26th of November...""
"
Ke polelo efeng seratswaneng e bontshang ka kotloloho sepheto sa Nadal Le Raonic papading ya Brisbane Open?,"The correct answer is **C: Nadal o hlola Raonic**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rekoto ya papiso ya Nadal kgahlanong le MoCanada eo ke 7–2."" This translates to ""Nadal's record against Canadian players is 7-2.""  A 7-2 record indicates that Nadal has won 7 matches and lost 2. Therefore, Nadal has beaten Raonic 7 times and lost 2 times, meaning Nadal *wins* against Raonic more often than Raonic wins against Nadal. Option C, ""Nadal o hlola Raonic"" (Nadal defeats Raonic), directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic o hlola Nadal** (Raonic defeats Nadal): This is the opposite of what the record shows.
*   **B: Raonic o fumane dintlha tse 88%** (Raonic won 88% of the points): This refers to Nadal's percentage of points won, not Raonic's.
*   **D: Raonic a hlaba dintlha tse 76** (Raonic won 76 points): This refers to the number of points Nadal *didn't* win.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, Nadal le Raonic ba ne ba le maemong afe kamora mokhahlelo wa pele?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal a hapa lintlha tse 76**.

The text states: ""Nadal o fumane 88% ya dintlha tsa papadi ya letloweng papading ena moo a hapileng dintlha tse 76 ha a ne a sefa bolo ya pele."" This translates to: ""Nadal achieved 88% of the points won in this match where he won 76 points when he did not serve.""
"
Ke lenaneho lefeng la puo le sa kenellang ho diphatlalatso tse tharo tsa Naked News?,"The correct answer is **D: Sepanishe**.

The text explicitly states that Naked News is adding programs in Spanish, Italian, and Korean.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, phatlalatso e ntjha ya Naked News ha e na ho fumaneha kae?","The correct answer is **B: Marang-rang (Online)**.

The text states they are adding language services for television, web, and mobile applications, which all fall under the category of online platforms. While they might eventually appear on TV or in cinemas, the initial announcement focuses on web and mobile.
"
Ke dibapadi tse kae tse hlolehileng ho qeta tlholisano ya Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""Bathellisi ba bane sehlopheng sa basadi ba dutseng ba hlolehile ho qeta mabelo a bona, mme ba 45 kakaretsong ya bathellisi ba 117 ho Giant Slalom ba hlolehile ho fumana maemo lebelong lena.""  This translates to: ""Four racers in the downhill group were able to finish their run, and 45 among the 117 racers in Giant Slalom were able to achieve a position in this race.""
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke polelo efeng e hlalosang hantle sephetho sa dipapadi tsa Bompodi?","The correct answer is **C: Dibapadi tse ngata tsa lehlweng di phetetse mokgahlelo wa Giant Slalom ho feta wa Slalom.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Bahlodisani ba 36 ho ba 116 ba fumane sephetho se tshwaneng lebelong leo."" This means that more athletes achieved a better result in Giant Slalom (116) than in Slalom (36).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mokhahlelong wa bobedi,Carpenado o qetile pele ho sebapadi sa Hungary sa lehlweng** - The text says Carpenado finished 10th in Giant Slalom, not that he finished before any Hungarian athlete.
* **B: Dibapadi tsa lehlweng tse 45 ha di ya phethela mokgahlelo wa bona ho Giant Slalom** - The text states 45 athletes completed their Giant Slalom run.
* **D: Carpenado o phethetse a le boemong ba leshome ho Slalom** - The text says he finished 10th in Giant Slalom, not Slalom.



Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the information given in the text."
NBA e khethile ho fanyeha eng ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Sehla sa basketball**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the NBA *suspended* its professional basketball season *due to concerns about COVID-19*.  This indicates the entire season was put on hold, not just a player or team.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sebapadi sa Utah Jazz:** While the Utah Jazz player's positive test was the trigger, the suspension wasn't *only* about that single player.
* **C: Sebapadi sefeng kapa sefeng se fumanweng se na le bohloko ba COVID-19:** The passage doesn't specify the exact player. It's about the general concerns related to COVID-19.
* **D: Sehlopha sa basketball sa Utah Jazz:** Similar to option B, the suspension wasn't solely focused on the Utah Jazz team.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e entseng hore NBA e be le ngongoreho mabapi kokwana-hloko?","The correct answer is **D: Sebapadi sa Utah Jazz se fumanwe se na le COVID 19.**

The passage states: ""Qeto ya NBA e latetse kamora hore **sebapadi sa Jazz sa Utah se fumanwe se na le vaerase ya COVID-19**."" This directly links the NBA's decision to a player on the Utah Jazz testing positive for COVID-19. While options A and B are related, option D is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text. Options C is incorrect because the passage does not mention the team's performance.
"
Ke mang ya hlabileng ntlha ya tlholo ya Washington Capitals kgahlanong le Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Thusetso ya pele ya Ovechkin ya phirimana e bile ntlheng e hapileng papadi e hlabilweng ke Nicklas Backstrom"". This directly indicates that Nicklas Backstrom scored the second goal for the Washington Capitals.
"
Ke mang ya hlabileng nthla ya bo 60 papading ya Capitals le Thrasahers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text states: ""tlhukung ya bona ya Washington ya dintlha tse 5-3 kgahlanong le Atlanta Thrashers. Thusetso ya pele ya Ovechkin ya phirimana e bile ntlheng e hapileng papadi e hlabilweng ke Nicklas Backstrom; **ntlha ya hae ya bobedi bosiung boo e bile ya bo-60 sehleng sa dipapadi, moo a bileng sebapadi sa pele ho hlaba dintlha tse 60 kapa ho feta sehleng haesale ho tloha ka 1995-96, moo Jaromir Jagr le Mario Lemieux ba fihletseng sehlohlolo sena sebapadi ka seng.**""

This clearly indicates that Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season in that game. While Jagr and Lemieux were the last to reach that milestone, the question asks who reached it *in this specific game*.



"
Banka ya Nothern Rock e hlokile tshehetso ya mmuso neng?,"The correct answer is **D: Nakong ya tlokotsi ya mekoloto (During the financial crisis)**.

The text explicitly states that Northern Rock needed support due to the poor financial condition caused by the housing market crisis of 2007.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kamorao hore banka ebe ya setjhaba (After the bank became nationalized)** - The text says it *needed* support *before* it was nationalized.
*   **B: Ha banka e kgaohana le khampani ya ho laola matlotlo (After the bank separated into a 'bad bank')** - The need for support was pre-dating the separation.
*   **C: Kamora hore Virgin group e reke banka (After the Virgin Group bought the bank)** - Virgin's failed bid was *before* the bank needed support.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke polelo efeng e hlalosang tshebelisano mmoho ya Virgin Group le banka ya Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: Virgin Group e ile ya reka banka kamorao hore e be ya setjhaba.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Virgin e rekile feela ‘banka e ntle’ ya Northern Rock, seng khampani ya taolo ya matlotlo.""  This means Virgin Group bought the *retail* side of Northern Rock *after* the government had taken over the entire bank.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Virgin Group e rekile le khampani e laolang matlotlo ya Northern Rock le yona:** Virgin only bought the retail side, not the troubled asset side.
* **C: Virgin Group e ile ya fa banka tsehetso ya tshohanyetso nakong ya tlokotsi ya mekoloto:** Virgin did not provide financial assistance during the crisis; they *bought* a portion of the bank.
* **D: Thahasello ya Virgin Group ya pele ya ho ba le banka e qadile kamora hore banka ebe ya setjhaba:** Virgin's initial interest was *before* the government takeover, but they weren't able to acquire the entire bank at that time. They only got a portion later.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke setjhaba sefeng se angweng ke tekenelo ya setlamo sa Kyoto sa ditaba tsa boemo ba lehodimo?","The correct answer is **A: Amerika**.

The text explicitly states: ""Qeto ya Mong Rudd ya Mong Rudd ya ho saena selekane sa tlelaemete sa Kyoto e kgethollela thoko United States..."" which translates to ""Prime Minister Rudd's decision to not sign the Kyoto Protocol excludes the United States..."".  The passage also mentions the US is now the only developed country not to have ratified the agreement.
"
Mmuso wa mehleng wa naha ya Australia o ne o nahanne hore ho phethahatsa setlamo sa Kyoto ho ka etsa tshenyo ho eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Moruo wa naha**.

The text states: ""Mmuso wa dinganyele wa Australia o hanne ho tiisa Selekane sa Kyoto, ka hore se tla senya moruo ka lebaka la boitshetleho bo matla hodima diromelwantle tsa mashala..."" (The conservative government of Australia opposed ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, saying it would harm the economy due to strong opposition to overseas shipping...)

Therefore, the Australian government believed that implementing the Kyoto Protocol would harm the **economy (moruo)**.
"
Ke lenaneo lefeng leo dibapadi tsa ho thunya tselaneng ba ileng ba le bitseswa?,"The correct answer is **D: Lenaneo la mokgatlo wa dipapadi tsa bo-Rasethunya**.

The text states: ""Selekaneng sa NPWS le Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, baithaopi ba tshwanelehang ba thaothilwe, tlasa lenaneo la ditsomi la Sporting Shooters Association.""  This indicates the program is associated with the Sporting Shooters Association.  While NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service) is involved, the *training program* itself is under the Sporting Shooters Association's umbrella.
"
Ke polelo efeng e sa hlaloseng ka nepo diteko tsa ho laola dikokonyana tse senyang dijalo?,"The best answer is **A: Jwalo kaha ene ele teko ya pele ya lenaneo,ha eya ka ya hlahlojwa.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks about an *unexplained* term.** The text mentions ""tekong ya taolo ya dikokonyana"" (control test of kangaroos) but doesn't specifically define *what* the test *is*. 
* **Option A** points out that it's the ""first test of the program"" and will be ""subject to review."" This implies it's not yet fully established or explained, making it the most likely candidate for an unexplained term.
* **Option B** is true, but doesn't address the lack of explanation of *what the test itself is*.
* **Option C** says they were guided by experts, which is a standard procedure and not unexplained.
* **Option D** simply states they were selected, also a straightforward fact.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that directly refers to the lack of explanation surrounding the ""control test of kangaroos.""
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, karohano e fumanwe kae?","The correct answer is **A: Rift Valley**.

The text states: ""Ho ipapisitswe le fossil ena, sena se bolela hore karohano e bile pele haholo ho nako e neng e lekantswe ke bopaki ba dimolikhule. """"Seo se bolela hore dintho tsohle di lokela ho kgutliswa,"""" ho rialo mofuputsi wa Rift Valley Research Service mane Ethiopia le mphato wa bongodi wa phuputso, Berhane Asfaw.""

This directly indicates the fossil was found in the Rift Valley. While Ethiopia is mentioned, the location of the find itself is the Rift Valley.
"
"Ho latela seratswana see,ke eng e etsahetseng pele ho nako eneng e lebeletswe?","The correct answer is **B: Karohano**.

The text states: ""Ho ipapisitswe le fossil ena, sena se bolela hore **karohano e bile pele haholo ho nako e neng e lekantswe ke bopaki ba dimolikhule**."" which translates to ""Based on this fossil, it shows that **separation happened a long time ago, a time measured by the evidence of primates**.""
"
Sebapadi se lokela ho etsa jwang hore se etse dithlaselo papading ya video?,"The correct answer is **C: Beha disensara pela thelefishine ya bona.**

Here's why:

* **The text states the controller uses two sensors placed *in front of* the television.** This is crucial for tracking the controller's position in 3D space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Etsa bonnete ba hore disensara di shebile pela console** - The text says the sensors are placed *in front of the television*, not the console.
* **B: Dietse hore boemo ba tsona e be ba mahlakore a mararo** - While the controller tracks movement in 3D space, the text doesn't explicitly state the sensors must be positioned at three different angles.  It's implied by the 3D control, but not explicitly stated as a requirement for the sensor placement.
* **D: Tsamaisa controller moeeng** - This is incorrect. The controller itself doesn't need to be moved in the air. The sensors track its position relative to the television.



"
Ke eng e neng e etseditswe ho shebahala jwalo ka remoutu ya thelefishene?,"The correct answer is **A: Disensara tse pedi tsa ho tsamaisa (Two motion sensors)**.

The text explicitly states: ""khonterolara e sebedisa disensara tse pedi tse behwang pela thelevishene ya mosebedisi..."" which translates to ""a controller that uses two motion sensors placed in front of the user's television..."". This directly answers the question of what makes the controller resemble a remote.
"
Ke eng esa bolelwang ditlalehong tsa moraorao tsa lefapha la ditaba la Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Sefofane se fumane tshoso ya seqhomane (The plane received fuel)**.

The text states: ""Ha morao ditlaleho di boletse hore sefofane se fumane tshosetso ya bomo mme sa kgeloswa ho kgutlela morao Afghanistan..."" which translates to ""Later reports said the plane received fuel and was refueled to return to Afghanistan...""

While the plane did go to Afghanistan and was supposed to fly to Kandahar, the *additional* information in the later reports is that it received fuel.
"
Ke eng eneng esa bolelwa ditlalehong tsa mathomo tsa lefapha le letjha la Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Sefofane se ile sa hanelwa ho tsorama hwa tshohanyetso**.

The text states: ""Tlaleho tsa pele di itse sefofane se kgeloseditswe morao Afghanistan kamora hore se hanelwe ho tsorama Ürümqi."" (Initial reports stated the plane was diverted back to Afghanistan after it refused to land in Ürümqi.)

While the other options are also mentioned, the refusal to land is the *reason* for the diversion, and therefore a key detail in the initial reports.
"
Ke eng e ileng ya tlalehwa ke Sara Danius seyalemoyeng ka nako ya lenaneo?,"The correct answer is **B: Komiti ha e a fumana dikarabo hotswa ho bo mphato ba bona**.

Here's why:

* The text states: """"Hajwale ha re etse letho. Ke letsitse le ho romela diimeile ho mosebeletsani ya haufi ka ho fetisisa le yena mme ka fumana dikarabo tsa botswalle. Bakeng sa hajwale, sena se lekane."""" This translates to: ""For now, we are doing nothing. I've sent emails to the closest contact and got replies from colleagues. For now, that's enough."" This indicates they haven't received the information they need.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mohlodi wa kgau e ikgethang ho dingodilweng** - While Sara Danius *is* the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, the question asks what she said *during the radio program*. The program focused on the Academy's inability to reach Bob Dylan.
* **C: Bakgethwa ba selemo sa 2016 ba kgau e ikgethang ya dingodilweng** - The text discusses the 2016 Nobel *Literature* Prize, not the nominees.
* **D: Komiti e tla tlohela ho etsa dikgato tsa ho kopana le Bob Dylan** - Danius says they are *not* doing anything further *at the moment*.
"
Ke mang ya neng a sa fumanehe?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**. 

The passage explicitly states that the Swedish Academy couldn't directly reach Bob Dylan regarding the Nobel Prize in Literature.
"
Ke mang a faneng ka maikutlo a boitlamo ba “kgatelo pele e kgolo”?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The text states: ""Sebui sa Bush Gordon Johndroe o bitsitse boitlamo ba naha ya Korea Leboya """"mohato o moholo mekutung ya ho fihlella phediso ya dibetsa tsa nutlelia koung ya Korea."""" (Bush's spokesperson Gordon Johndroe called North Korea's statement a ""significant step towards achieving the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons."")

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who made the statement about the significance of North Korea's claim.
"
Słania o entse ditempe tse kae tsa dinaha tse fapaneng?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka hodimo ho 1,000**.

The text states: ""O hlahisitse ditempe tse fetang 1,000 ho tswa Sweden le tse 28 tsa dinaheng tse ding."" which translates to ""He has produced more than 1,000 stamps from Sweden and 28 from other countries."" Therefore, he has produced more than 1,000 stamps from different countries.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, sesosa se tswelapeleng sa ho dutla ha difente tsa ditanka e ka nna ya ba sefeng?","The correct answer is **C: Katoloso ya motjheso**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""MaLaboraro, masobana a tanka a ne a sa ntse a dutla, mohlomong ka lebaka la ho kokomoswa ke motjheso ka hare ho tanka.""  This translates to, ""Around Laboraro, the tank supports were not seated, possibly due to being corroded inside the tank.""

Therefore, corrosion (katoloso ya motjheso) is the most likely cause of the tank supports not being seated properly and contributing to the rupture.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Sebaka sa bobedi sa poloko ya dintho tse ka bang kotsi mosebetsing se tlatsitswe tswete** (The second hazardous material containment area was filled with sludge): The passage mentions a rupture and oil leakage, not specifically sludge.
* **B: Diteko tse tlwaehileng tsa tsamaiso ya tlhokomediso ya mollo wa tshohanyetso** (Extended inspections of the emergency shut-off system): While inspections are important, the passage points to a structural failure related to corrosion.
* **D: Mollo ho e nngwe ya diteishene tsa dipompo tsa Fort Greely** (Oil leak at one of the Fort Greely pump stations): The passage mentions oil leakage, but it doesn't specifically state the leak was *at* one of the pump stations. It says the leak happened along the pipeline.



"
Hobaneng dipompo di ile tsa buleha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho bile le ho kgaoha hwa motlakase kamora ho etsa diteko tsa metjhine.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho kgaoha ha motlakase kamora teko ya tlwaelo ya sistimi ho bakile hore divalefo di bulehe..."" (A power outage after a routine system test caused valves to open...). This directly links the power outage to the valve opening and subsequent rupture of the barrels.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho ne ho ena le katoloso ya mocheso kahara ditanka:** While temperature expansion *can* cause problems, the passage focuses on the power outage as the *initial trigger*.
* **C: Dintanka di ne di tletse tswete:** The passage doesn't mention the tanks being full of water.
* **D: Sebaka sa bobedi sa poloko ya dintho tse ka bang kotsi mosebetsing se ne se sitwa ho amohela meqomo kaofela:**  The passage states that a second safety area wasn't functioning properly, but it doesn't explicitly say it was *blocking* the proper receipt of cargo. The power outage directly caused the barrels to rupture.



"
"Ha jwale, metsi a bophahamo bo bokae Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Ho fihla thekeng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Metsi a tsholohela kahodimo ho levee karolong e nang le bophara ba maoto a 100."" This means the water is reaching *over* the levee, and since the levee was 20 feet high, the water is reaching the top of the levee and exceeding it. The question asks how high the water is in the Ninth Ward. Since the water is over the levee, it's reaching the Ninth Ward.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bohato ba maoto a 20:** This refers to the height of the levee, not the water level.
* **B: Diintjhi tse 6:** This is the amount of rain predicted, not the current water level.
* **D: Bohato ba maoto a 100:** This is the width of the levee, not the water level.



"
"Ka nako ya leholiotswana la Katarina, ho etsahetseng Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **A: Metsi a dikhohola a ne le bohato ba maoto a 100 ka bophara**.

The passage states: ""Wate ya Borobong, e boneng dikgohola tsa bophahamo ba maoto a 20 nakong ya Sefefo sa Katrina, hajwale e na le metsi a bophahamong ba letheka moo levee e haufinyane e tlotsweng ke metsi. Metsi a tsholohela kahodimo ho levee karolong e nang le bophara ba maoto a 100.""  This directly describes the flooding in the Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.
"
Ke ntho efeng ho tse latelang e sa netefatswang ke Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **B: Khonahalo ya hore bakudi ba bang ba tshwaetswe ke kokwana-hloko (The possibility that other people have been infected)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the hospital *followed* protocols to prevent transmission.**  This means they *didn't* confirm that others *have* been infected.  The protocols were put in place *because* there was a risk, but it wasn't stated that the risk materialized.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Moo mokudi a tsamaileng (Where the patient traveled):** The passage explicitly states the patient traveled to Nigeria, where Ebola cases occurred.
* **C: Ho re na methati e nepahetseng e latetswe (That proper protocols were followed):** The passage directly says the hospital followed protocols for infection control.
* **D: Maemo a hajwale a mokudi (The patient's current condition):** The passage states the patient is in stable condition.



Therefore, the only statement that *isn't* definitively confirmed by the text is that other people have been infected.



"
Ke ntho efeng eo bo-ramahlale ba batlang ho e bona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha mechochonono e thulana le Lefatshe**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** ""Borasaense ba tshepa ho utlwisisa ka moo dipolanete di thomehang ka teng, haholoholo ka moo Lefatshe le thomehileng, haesale dikhomete di thulana le Lefatshe nako e telele e fetileng."" (Scientists hope to understand where the first planets are, especially where Earth originated, **because** chemicals interacted with Earth a long time ago.)

* **The key link:** The paragraph connects the origin of life (chemicals interacting with Earth) to the formation of planets. Scientists want to understand this interaction.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ho re na diporotheine di thehilwe jwang (How proteins were formed):** While protein formation is *related* to the origin of life, the paragraph's main focus is on the interaction between chemicals and Earth.
* **C: Ho re na manyolo ke eng (What life is):** The paragraph doesn't directly discuss what life *is*, but rather *how life might have originated*.
* **D: Lefatshe le thehilwe jwang (How Earth was formed):** The paragraph mentions Earth's origin, but it's to explain *why* scientists are looking at planet formation - to understand the conditions that allowed for chemical interaction and the emergence of life.



Therefore, option A best captures the scientists' underlying goal: to understand the interaction between chemicals and early Earth, which is linked to planet formation.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke karolo efeng eo mapolesa a lehae a e bapetseng ho etsa mokwallo?","The correct answer is **A: Ba khothaleditse FBI ho etsa mokwallo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Maryland Transportation Authority e kwetse phuputso ka ho kgothaletsa FBI."" (Maryland Transportation Authority is increasing scrutiny by collaborating with the FBI.) This indicates they are partnering with the FBI to investigate.
"
Ho etsahetseng ka ditjhubu nakong eo ho neng ho kwalwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Di ile tsa kwalwa**.

The passage states: ""Dilori tsa matlakala di sebedisitswe ho thibela menyako ya tjhubu..."" which translates to ""Tow trucks were used to prevent accidents caused by crashes..."".  This means the crashes (and therefore the resulting damage to vehicles) occurred.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, keng e sa kang ya etsahala pele radifoto a qetelle a thutswe ke koloi?","The correct answer is **C: Ralifoto o ile a nka dinepe tsa letshwao la kemiso la mapolesa a tseleng.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bieber o itse """"leha ke ne ke le siyo kapa ke ameha ka kotloloho kotsing ena e madimabe, ke lebisa mehopolo ya ka le dithapelo tsa ka ho lelapa la mofu."""" Webosaete ya ditaba tsa boithabiso TMZ e utlwisisa hore raditshwantsho o emisitse koloi ya hae lehlakoreng le leng la Sepulveda Boulevard mme a leka ho nka **ditshwantsho tsa mapolesa** ha a emisa pele a tshela tsela le ho tswela pele...""

This directly indicates that he attempted to take pictures of the police officers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Radifoto o ile a laelwa ke balaodi ba sephethephethe ho kgutlela morao:** While he was asked to move over, the passage doesn't say he was *ordered* to drive backward.
*   **B: Radifoto o ile a paka koloi ya hae mmileng o moholo wa Sepulveda Boulevard:** The passage states he *stopped* his car, not that he parked it.
*   **D: Radifoto o ile a atleha ho nka senepe sa Bieber:** The passage doesn't mention Bieber at all. It's about the photographer and the police.



"
Radifoto o ne a leka ho etsa eng pele a ka thulwa ke koloi?,"The correct answer is **B: O ile a nka dinepe tsa letshwao la kemiso la mapolesa a tseleng.**

The text states: ""Bieber o itse """"leha ke ne ke le siyo kapa ke ameha ka kotloloho kotsing ena e madimabe, ke lebisa mehopolo ya ka le dithapelo tsa ka ho lelapa la mofu."""" Webosaete ya ditaba tsa boithabiso TMZ e utlwisisa hore raditshwantsho o emisitse koloi ya hae lehlakoreng le leng la Sepulveda Boulevard mme a **leka ho nka ditshwantsho tsa mapolesa ha a emisa pele a tshela tsela le ho tswela pele**, leng se bakileng hore lepolesa la California Highway Patrol le neng le emisa makoloi le mo laele ho tshela tsela a kgutle, habedi. ""

This clearly indicates he was trying to take pictures of the police officers.
"
Ke polelo e feng e sa hlaloseng ka nepo maemo a Moporesitente kamora ho fumanwa a na le tshwaetso?,"The correct answer is **D: O na le feberu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho fapana le feberu le mmetso, ke ikutlwa hantle mme ke itekanetse ho ka phetha mosebetsi wa ka ka boikopanyo ba mehala."" This translates to: ""Unlike the flu and a cold, I feel well and I am able to perform my duties with full capacity.""

Therefore, the passage mentions having a **feberu** (which translates to a cold or flu) and explicitly states he is feeling well *compared to* having a cold/flu. The other options are not mentioned or implied in the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo e feng e leng nnete ka Moporesitente?","The correct answer is **C: O maemong a hantle hore a ka bua ka fono (He is feeling well enough to talk on the phone)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ho fapana le feberu le mmetso, ke ikutlwa hantle mme ke itekanetse ho ka phetha mosebetsi wa ka ka boikopanyo ba mehala."" (Unlike February and the flu, I am feeling well and confident that I can perform my duties with full capacity.) This directly indicates he's feeling well.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha a na feberu (He doesn't have a fever):** The text explicitly mentions he is comparing his current state to February and the flu, implying he *did* have a fever or illness previously.
* **B: O tla dula hae dibeke tse mmalwa (He will stay home for several weeks):**  The text says he plans to return to work on Monday, contradicting this statement.
* **D: O maemong a hlobaetsang ka lebaka la kokwana-hloko (He is in a serious condition due to a heart attack):** The text doesn't mention a heart attack. It refers to February and the flu, suggesting a different illness.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, lehoduotswana Gonu le ne le lebelletswe hore le tswelepele ho fokotseha neng?","The correct answer is **A: Pele le ka fihla Maldives**.

The passage states: ""...se fihletse meya e phehellang ya lebelo la dikhilomitara tse 240 ka hora... Hoseng kajeno, meya e ne e foka ka lebelo le ka bang 83 km/h, mme ne e lebeletswe hore e tla tswela pele ho fokotseha."" This indicates that the flight was expected to continue decreasing speed *before* reaching the Maldives. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the passage links the speed reduction to the journey *to* the Maldives.
"
Meya e ne le sekgahla se sekae ha lohoduotswana Gonu le fihlela sehlohlolong?,"The correct answer is **C: Dimmaele tse 149 ka hora**

Here's why:

* The passage states the speed is ""meya e phehellang ya lebelo la dikhilomitara tse 240 ka hora"" which translates to ""the current speed is close to the expected speed of 240 kilometers per hour.""
* It then says ""Hoseng kajeno, meya e ne e foka ka lebelo le ka bang 83 km/h,"" meaning ""Today, the speed was about 83 km/h.""
* Finally, it mentions ""mme ne e lebeletswe hore e tla tswela pele ho fokotseha"" - ""...and was expected to continue to decrease.""
* Therefore, the expected *maximum* speed (before slowing down) is 240 km/h, which is equivalent to 149 mph.

Therefore, option C is the accurate answer."
Ho tse latelang ke efeng tshobotsi esa nkuweng ele ya sebopuwa se senyenyane se bitswang Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **A: Ke mofuta wa bolele**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Leqhubu le lefubedu le bakwa ke maemo a phahameng ka tsela e sa tlwaelehang a *Karenia brevis*, e leng sehodilweng se bang teng ka tlhaho sa sele e le nngwe lewatleng."" (The red tide is caused by an abnormally high bloom of *Karenia brevis*, a naturally occurring single-celled algae.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E ka etsa hore methapo ya batho e se sebetse** (It can make people's gills not work): While the passage mentions that people can be affected by inhaling the toxins, it doesn't specifically say it makes gills *not work*.
* **C: E disele di ngata** (It makes a lot of noise): The passage doesn't mention any noise.
* **D: E etsahala ka tlholeho** (It happens quietly): The passage describes a ""high bloom,"" implying it's not quiet.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is that *Karenia brevis* is a type of algae (bolele).
"
Ho tse latelang ke eng eo Karenia brevis e sitwang etsa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho hlahisa tjhefu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bolele bona bo hlahisa tjhefo ya methapokutlo e ka holofatsang methapokutlo bathong le ditlhaping."" This translates to ""Their proliferation produces toxins that can cause health and economic impacts.""  The question asks what Karenia brevis is doing, and the passage says it's producing toxins.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho etsa hore methapo ya litlhapi e se ke ya sebetsa:** The passage doesn't mention anything about Karenia brevis affecting coral polyps.
* **B: Ho eketseha ka sekgahla tlasa maemo afe kapa afe:** While the passage mentions proliferation, it doesn't focus on *where* it proliferates in general. The focus is on the toxins it produces.
* **C: Ho ama metsi:**  Karenia brevis doesn't ""pollute water""; it *toxifies* it through the production of toxins.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e sa etsahalang ka lebaka la lehodiotswana la Felicia?","The correct answer is **C: Lehadima le iphetang** (Heavy rain).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Masalla a yona a hlahisitse dishawara ho parola boholo ba dihlekehleke, leha hajwale, ho se tshenyo e bileng teng e tlalehilweng."" This means the storm produced showers and the potential for heavy rainfall.
* The text also says: ""Ho na ha pula, ho fihlileng ho diinche tse 6.34 moo ho methilweng teng Oahu, ho hlalositswe ho le 'molemo'.""  This confirms rain occurred, but it was classified as ""moderate"" rainfall.
* The passage *does* mention heavy rain as a possibility (""boholo ba dihlekehleke"" - great amounts of showers), but it *doesn't* state that heavy rain actually occurred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pula e molemo (The storm is moderate):** This is *true* according to the text.
* **B: Pula e latelwang ke seaduma (The storm is followed by heavy rain):** The text mentions showers and the *potential* for heavy rain, but it doesn't say that heavy rain is definitely following the storm.
* **D: Dikgohola tsa tseleng (Road hazards):** The text says the storm produced heavy showers and potential for dangerous conditions, and mentions gusty winds, which *could* lead to road hazards. It doesn't *directly* say road hazards are occurring.

Therefore, the statement that is *not* supported by the text is that heavy rain is occurring.



"
Ke polelo e feng e seng nnete ka lehoduotswana la Felicia?,"The correct answer is **A: Pula e tlileng kamorao e ile ya tswela Oahu molemo**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Pula, ho fihlileng ho diinche tse 6.34 moo ho methilweng teng Oahu, ha hlalositswe ho le **""molemo""**."" This means the rain *in Oahu* was considered beneficial. 
* The statement ""Pula e tlileng kamorao e ile ya tswela Oahu molemo"" implies that the entire storm was beneficial to Oahu. The text *only* mentions the rain being beneficial, not the storm overall.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: E ile ya qala pele e tlalehwa e le mofuta o monyane wa lehoduotswana pele e ka ba mokhahlelong wa 4 wa sefefo** - The text says it weakened to a ""tropical depression"" *before* being forecast to become a Category 4 hurricane.
* **C: Boholo ba dihlekehleke di ile tsa fumana pula** - The text says the storm's gusts produced showers of rain, suggesting widespread rain.
* **D: Pula e nngwe e ne na ka lehadima** - The text explicitly states ""Pula e nngwe e ne na ka lehadima"" (One of the showers had damaging winds).



"
Ke polelo e feng e hlalosang ka nepo sephetho sa Grand Prix ya Hungarian ya selemo sa 2009?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. o ile a tebelwa ha morao.**

The passage states: ""Piquet Jr. o ile a tebelwa kamora mojaho wa 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" This directly translates to ""Piquet Jr. was banned after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernado Alonso o ile a ameha kotsing:** While Alonso was involved in the incident at the Singapore Grand Prix, this statement doesn't relate to the Hungarian Grand Prix.
* **B: Piquet Jr. o ile a hlola:** The passage says he was banned, not penalized or fined.
* **D: Koloi ya tshireletso e ile ya ameha kotsing:** The safety car was deployed due to the incident, but the passage focuses on Piquet Jr.'s consequences.



"
Kotsi e ile ya etsahala neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Hang ka mora hore Alonso a pote setopong sa papali (Immediately after Alonso pitted)**.

The passage states: ""Piquet Jr. o thutse lebelong la ka 2008 la Singapore Grand Prix kamora kgefu ya """"pit stop"""" ho ema e sa le qalong ha Fernando Alonso..."" This indicates the incident happened right after Alonso's pit stop.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke e feng ho tse latelang e nkileng nako e khutshwane ho feta ka moo bo ralipatlisiso ba neng ba lebeletse?","The correct answer is **D: Ntshetso pele yha dintho tse phelang (Evolution of living things)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the researchers believe the new finch species evolved over a *long* time, referencing Darwin's finches.  Evolution is the process of change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. The study is about understanding *how* these finches evolved.  The other options don't directly relate to the timeframe or the core finding of the research as described.
"
Ke e feng ya dintho tse latelang tse neng di sa tlalehwa ke bo ralipatlisiso?,"The correct answer is **D: Dinonyana tse amehileng katisong ya tsona (The finches involved in the study)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the researchers studied two finch species: *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza conirostris*.  Therefore, knowing *which* finches were studied isn't something the research *didn't* address.
* The research *did* identify a new finch species and study the evolutionary relationships between different finches.
* The study's findings contribute to understanding the evolution of species (specifically the development of new beak shapes).
* The study's findings don't directly address the origins of life or the broader evolutionary history. 

Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer as the researchers *did* study and identify the finches involved in their research.
"
Ketsahalo ya “CowParade” e tla etsahala hokae?,"The correct answer is **B: Toropong ya Bucharest**.

The text explicitly states: ""Toropokgolo e tla ba yona ya pele Yuropo borwabotjhabela ho tshwara CowParade..."" which translates to ""The city will be the first in Northern Europe to host CowParade..."" and also ""Ketsahalo ya bonono ya bonono e kgolo ka ho fetisisa lefatseng ya setjhaba, dipakeng tsa Phupjane le Phato selemong sena."" meaning ""...between June and August this year."" 

While it mentions Northern Europe, the specific location for the event is Bucharest, the capital of Romania.
"
Ke polelwana e feng ho tse latelang e hlalosang hantle “CowParade”?,"The correct answer is **D: Ke ketsahalo e kgolo ya bonono lefatsheng ka bophara**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""toropokgolo e tla ba yona ya pele Yuropo borwabotjhabela ho tshwara CowParade, **e leng ketsahalo ya bonono e kgolo ka ho fetisisa lefatsheng ya setjhaba**..."" (the city will be the first in Europe to host CowParade, which is the largest international art event in the world...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E etsahala ditoropong tse kgolo tse nang le “boqapi’’ bo bongata** - While CowParade *can* take place in large cities with a lot of character, this isn't the defining characteristic mentioned in the text.
* **B: E entswe holong ya teropo e kgolo ya Bucharest** - The text doesn't specify where CowParade was created. It only mentions that Bucharest is hosting it for the first time in Europe.
* **C: Ke ketsahalo ya bonono etshwarwang borwa-botjhabela ba Europa lehlabula kaofela** - The text mentions Europe, but it also states it's a global event, not limited to Europe.



"
Keng se bakileng hore naha ya Russia e fanyehe tshebeliso ya sefofane sa moetso wa II-76s?,"The correct answer is **A: Mabotho a kahare**.

The text states: ""Sefofane sena se ne se fofiswa ke mabotho a kahare ho naha."" This translates to ""This plane was being blown up by internal saboteurs.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotsi (Accident):** While the text mentions an accident, it doesn't state that the accident *caused* the increased use of the plane. The accident is a consequence of the sabotage.
* **C: Sesole sa Soviet (Soviet Era):**  While the Il-76 is associated with the Soviet era, the question asks *why* Russia increased its use of the planes.  The reason is the sabotage.
* **D: Dipatlisiso tse emisitsweng (Unusual investigations):** The text doesn't mention any unusual investigations.

Therefore, the most direct answer based on the provided text is that internal sabotage caused the increased use (or, more accurately, the need to maintain and use the planes despite the sabotage) of the Il-76 aircraft.
"
II-76 keng?,"The correct answer is **C: Sefofane se tsamayang moyeng (Aircraft)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sefofane sena sa Il-76 haesale e le karolo e kgolo ya bobedi sesole sa Russia le Soviet ho tloha dilemong tsa bo-1970...""  This clearly identifies the Il-76 as an aircraft.
"
Ke mang ya hirileng sehlopha se ngolang lenaneo la “The Simpsons”?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The text states: ""Ka 1989 o thusitse ho theha The Simpsons le Brooks and Groening, mme o ne a ikarabella bakeng sa ho hira sehlopha sa ho ngola sa pele sa pontsho.""  This directly indicates that Simon hired the writing team for The Simpsons.
"
"Ho latela Fluke, ke mang ya neng a mo romella maikutlo a matle le kgothatso?","The correct answer is **D: Banna le basadi ka bo mong**.

The passage states: ""ka bobedi ke basadi le banna ba kgothaletsang hore meriana ya dithibelapelehi e nkuwe e le e hlokahalang bakeng sa tshebediso ya bongaka."" (both women and men who support the need for preventative medicine to be taken for the proper functioning of healthcare.)



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng seo batho ba bang ba neng ba sa se thabele ha basadi ba bua ka sona?","The correct answer is **C: Bophelo bo botle ba basadi**

The question states that Fluke believes people are uncomfortable when women talk about women's health. Option C directly reflects this statement.
"
"Hoya ka Seratswana, ke efe polanete e mahlahahlaha?","The correct answer is **A: Lefatshe**.

The passage explicitly states: ""E na le sebopeho sa polanete e le nngwe e bontshang diphetophetoho haholwanyane ho feta Lefatshe,"" which translates to ""It has the structure of one planet that shows small changes compared to Earth.""

Therefore, the question is asking to identify the planet mentioned in the context. The passage directly names **Lefatshe** (Earth).
"
Ke polaneteng efeng moo ho ileng hwa bonahala dinoka le matsha ana le ntho etsweu e metsi?,"The answer is **B: Thaethene**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a planet with oceans and the ability to see deep underwater, even seeing creatures like ""matlakala a tlase lewatleng"" (creatures below the water). This strongly points to **Europa**, one of Jupiter's moons.  Europa is known to have a vast subsurface ocean beneath a thick icy crust.  The question specifically asks about oceans and water features, which are key characteristics of Europa.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Tosa (Venus):** Venus is known for its extremely hot and dense atmosphere, not oceans.
*   **C: Letsatsi (Sun):** The Sun is a star and has no oceans.
*   **D: Mmanaane (Mars):** While Mars has evidence of past water, it doesn't currently have oceans, and the passage emphasizes deep, visible underwater life.

"
"Ho tse latelang, ke diphuputso di feng tseo eseng liphetho tsa ho sibollwa hwa masiba?","The correct answer is **C: Dikateng tsa tshimoloho ya masiba (Fossil records of scales)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that fossil records *cannot* confirm details like color and three-dimensional shape.**  This means the fossil record itself doesn't provide definitive information about the *evolutionary history* of the scales (how they changed over time). The passage only mentions *interpretations* of scale changes based on scale structure.
* **Options A, B, and D are all interpretations or conclusions *drawn from* the fossil evidence:**
    * **A (Color of scales):** Scientists *interpret* the scale structure to infer the color.
    * **B (The use of scales):**  Scientists *infer* the purpose (thermoregulation or display) based on scale structure.
    * **D (Confirmation of scale presence):**  The passage mentions that the fossil evidence confirms the *presence* of scales.



Therefore, the only option that isn't a conclusion *based on* the fossil evidence is C.
"
Ke eng eo masiba a kgodumodumo a neng a se na yona?,"The correct answer is **B: Karolo ya lesiba e bitswang rachis**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hobane masiba a daenosara ha a na moqala o tiileng, o bitswang **""""rachis""""**, empa e na le dibopeho tse ding tsa masiba — meutlwa le meutlwana — bafuputsi ba ne ba utlwisisa hore di-rachis e bile sebopeho se hlahileng ha morao ho feta dibopeho tsena tse ding.""

This means the dinosaurs' crests lacked a specific core structure called a rachis.
"
Ke polelo efeng eseng nnete ka setlhare sa ZMapp?,"The correct answer is **A: Se entswe ka dithibela mafu (It was made from monkey fetuses)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states ZMapp was derived from simian (monkey) antibodies.** It doesn't mention it being made from monkey fetuses.
* **B: Se ka phekola tswhaetso empa eseng ho thibela lefu (It can treat the infection but not prevent the disease):** The passage *does* say it showed promise for treating Ebola.
* **C: Se ile sa sebetsa ele taolo nakong ya diteko tsa PALM (It worked as a control in the PALM trials):**  The passage explicitly states ZMapp *was used as a control* in the PALM trial.
* **D: Boithuto bo bontsha melemo ya sona e fokola hofeta kamoo ho neng ho lebeletswe (The study shows its efficacy is lower than anticipated):** The passage confirms that the study showed ZMapp had lower efficacy than initially hoped.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that is demonstrably false according to the text."
"Dipolelong tsee, ke e feng e hlalosang ka botlalo teko ya PALM?","The correct answer is **B: Setlhare se alafang se ile sa bapiswa le tse ling tse phekolang mme hara tsona e ne le setlhare sa ZMapp.**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Tekong ya PALM, ZMapp e sebeditse jwalo ka letsoho la taolo, e leng se bolelang hore borasaense ba e sebedisitse jwalo ka motheo le ho bapisa dikalafo tse ding tse tharo le yona.""  This means the ZMapp treatment was compared to other treatments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Boithuto bo sibolotse hore e ka nna ya ba le melemo e mengata ho feta kamoo ho neng ho lebeletswe:** While the study *did* suggest potential benefits, this isn't the defining characteristic of the PALM trial *itself*. The trial's defining feature was the comparison.
* **C: Setlhare sa ZMapp se sebelisitswe qetellong ya diteko:** The passage says ZMapp was used as a *control* treatment, meaning it was used for comparison, not at the end.
* **D: E bonahetse e sebetsa hantle ho phekola maemo a renang:** The passage doesn't explicitly state that ZMapp worked well in treating severe cases, only that it was part of a comparison group.



"
Ke hokae moo bo-radiphuputso ba nahanang hore tjhipi e ka ba bohlokwa haholo?,"The correct answer is **B: Dinaha tse ruileng**.

The text explicitly states: ""...moo dikgahla tsa ho pholoha bokuding bo jwalo ka kankere ya letswele e ka bang halofo ya dinaheng tse ruileng."" (where the burden of diseases like lung cancer can be as high as half in low-income countries.) This indicates the researchers believe the chip will be particularly impactful in low-income countries.
"
Ke mokgwa o feng o tla sebediswa ho etsa sesebediswa sa tlhahlobo?,"The correct answer is **B: Diporintara tse tlwaeleileng tsa inkjet**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...tjhipi e nyane e kgonang ho porintwa e ka etswa ho sebediswa diprintara tsa tlwaelo tsa """"inkjet""""..."" 

While option A mentions a cost, and option C mentions the chip itself, option B directly addresses the *method* of creating the device – using standard inkjet printers.
"
"Ho latela seratswana see,ke polelo efeng eo eseng nnete ka dibopeho tse dinthong tse ding tse dipolaneteng?","The correct answer is **A: Ho ka etsahala hore ebe diketsahalo tse di entseng di etsahetse haufinyane (It's possible that the events that created them happened recently).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the lobate scarps are relatively young geological features.** This directly contradicts the idea that the events causing them happened long ago.
* **Option A acknowledges the possibility of recent events, which aligns with the passage's conclusion.**
* **Option B is incorrect** because the passage indicates the moon *does* have geological activity, evidenced by the scarps.
* **Option C is correct**, as the passage states the scarps are caused by the moon's gradual shrinking.
* **Option D is incorrect** because the passage *does* mention the number of scarps.

Therefore, the statement that contradicts the passage's findings is that the events responsible for the scarps occurred in the distant past.  Option A is the closest to directly opposing this idea.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana see, ke kgopolo taba efeng mabapi le dibopeho tsa lefatshe e bontshang hore hona le ho foforeha hwa majwe le mobu etsahalang khweling?","The correct answer is **A: Khweli entse e honyela hanyane ka hanyane.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Borasaense ba sibolotse dibopeho tse tletseng kgweding tse bitswang di-lobate scarp tseo ho bonahalang di bakilwe ke ha kgwedi e ntse e honyela butlebutle haholo.""  This translates to ""Scientists have discovered extensive formations over the past few years called lobate scarps which appear to have been caused by the moon's slow but significant receding.""
* **The passage connects the lobate scarps to the moon's receding.**  The scarps are relatively new geological features, indicating recent geological activity.
* **Option A directly reflects this connection:** The moon's slow recession (honyelo hanyane ka hanyane) is presented as the cause of the lobate scarps, implying ongoing geological change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dibopeho tsa lefatshe di bile teng ho tloha khale:** This contradicts the passage, which highlights the recent formation of the lobate scarps.
* **C: Ke dibopeho tse fokolang tsa lefatshe hodima khweli:**  The passage doesn't mention features *above* the moon.
* **D: Dibopeho tsena tsa lefatshe di e ntswe haholo morao tjena:**  While the scarps are recent, option A is a more accurate summary of the reason *why* they are recent.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke eng e sa tlo hlola e ba teng ka bongata ho fihlela qoso e ba teng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho tshohlwa hwa bopaki ba paki e boneng ka mahlo (The release of eyewitness evidence)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sena se etsahala haholo naheng ya UK empa tshebetso ya toka Scottland e sebetsa ka tsela e fapaneng mme makgotla a lekotse phatlalatso ya difoto jwalo ka ketsahalo e ka nnang ya senya nyewe."" This means that the Scottish court carefully considers the release of photos and other information that could prejudice the trial. The professor mentions that journalists take risks when releasing photos of victims. The Prosecutor's Office also tells journalists not to release information until the trial begins.

Therefore, the release of eyewitness evidence (evidence seen by people) is the thing that is being scrutinized to avoid prejudicing the trial. Options A, B, and D are not directly addressed or supported by the text.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana see, ke eng eo e seng bothata ba ha jwale ba di-sealers?","The correct answer is **C: Botenya ba leqhwa (Thickness of the grout)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the main problem is the *poor condition of the grout* (maemo a lehodimo a mabe).
* It mentions the *amount and sound of the grout* (bongata le morumo wa pokellano ya leqhwa) are problematic.
* It highlights that the situation is expected to *worsen* (maemo a keke a ntlafala).

The passage **doesn't** mention anything about the *thickness* of the grout being an issue. It focuses on the quality, sound, and overall poor condition.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Botenya ba leqhwa**.
"
"Ho tlatselletsa moo,ke eng hape e amang matsapa a pholoso?","The correct answer is **B: Maemo ba lehodimo (Poor soil conditions)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ntle ho leqhwa le boiman, maemo a lehodimo a mabe ka ho fetisisa a ntse a sitisa mekutu ya pholoso."" which translates to ""In addition to the blight, extremely poor soil conditions have been hindering the growth of the trees.""

Therefore, poor soil conditions are another factor hindering the growth of the trees.
"
Ke tumelo e feng eo Robett a neng a tlohele ho e netefatsa?,"The correct answer is **B: Bohlokwa ba dikahlolo tse nyallanang tsa Lekgotla le Phahameng (The importance of lifetime appointments of the Supreme Court).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""o thathiseleditse polelo ya hae ya pejana ya hore kahlolo ya Roe v. Wade ke """"molao o phethahetseng wa naha"""", a thathiseletsa bohlokwa ba dikahlolo tse tshehetsanang tsa Lekgotla le Phahameng.""  This translates to: ""He reiterated his previous statement that the Roe v. Wade decision was a """"living constitutional"""" and thus emphasized the importance of lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court.""

The passage is highlighting his belief that lifetime appointments are crucial because they ensure that the Supreme Court can uphold precedents like Roe v. Wade.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boleng ba ho tshohla dinyewe (The sanctity of life):** While the Roe v. Wade decision relates to the sanctity of life, the passage focuses on the *importance of the court's lifetime appointments* to uphold the Roe v. Wade precedent, not his personal belief in the sanctity of life.
*   **C: Qaleho ya bophelo (The beginning of life):** Similar to A, the passage doesn't directly address his belief about the beginning of life, but rather how that belief connects to the court's authority and precedents.
*   **D: Tokelo ya ho ba le lekunutu (The right to privacy):**  The passage mentions the right to privacy as being at the heart of the Roe v. Wade decision, but it focuses on the court's lifetime appointments as the mechanism to protect that right.



"
Ke taba e feng eo Robert a ileng a utlwa ho fosahetse hore e ka tshohlwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho nyallana hwa likahlolo tsa Lekgotla le Phahameng la**.

The passage states that Roberts ""thatched his previous language that the Roe v. Wade decision was an 'executable law of the country,' underscoring the importance of ongoing decisions of the Supreme Court."" This directly points to concerns about the future decisions of the Supreme Court. While he acknowledges the right to privacy, the primary concern highlighted is the *ongoing decisions of the Supreme Court*.
"
Mahlasedi a mabedi a kganya a tjhabela hokae?,"The correct answer is **D: Mahareng a sebaka sa bokgutso se bulehileng sa sehopotso.**

The passage states: ""Mabone a mabedi a hlonngwe ho sheba lehodimo bosiu."" This translates to ""Two watchmen were deployed at the open observation post of the outpost at night.""  Therefore, the watchmen are stationed at the observation post.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, mehaho e metelele e metjha e tla ahwa neng setsheng seo?","The correct answer is **A: Mahareng a letsatsi (At dawn)**.

The passage states: ""Kaho e a tswella bakeng sa meaho ya mafaufau e mehlano e metjha setsing sena, moo ho nang le setsi sa dipalanngwang le paraka ya sehopotso kgubung ya sona.""  This means the train is heading to the five luxury villas, which are located in a valley. The valley is referred to as ""setsing sena"" (this valley). The phrase ""Mahareng a letsatsi"" (At dawn) implies the villas are situated in a location that is best viewed or accessed at sunrise.
"
Ke ditaba dife tse hlahisang hore “The Seven Sisters” ke mahaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho fapana ha metjheso le serame**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ditshwantsho tsa infrared di bontsha hore diphetoho tsa motjheso ho tloha motshehare ho ya bosiung di bontsha hore ekaba ke mahaha."" (Infrared images show that temperature changes from day to night indicate that it is a volcano.)
* It also mentions: ""A phodile ho feta dibaka tse a potileng motshehare mme a futhumetse bosiu."" (It is hotter than places that are heated during the day and cools down at night.)

These temperature fluctuations (daytime heating and nighttime cooling) are characteristic of volcanoes, indicating internal heat.  The other options are not directly supported by the text. The text only refers to the temperature changes and not the width of the craters, minerals or surface features, or comparisons to other volcanoes on Earth.



"
Boitshwaro ba motjheso wa Seven Sisters bo fumanwa jwang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditshwantsho see lekanyang tempereitjhara ya ntho e itseng**.

The passage states: ""Ditshwantsho tsa infrared di bontsha hore diphetoho tsa motjheso ho tloha motshehare ho ya bosiung di bontsha hore ekaba ke mahaha."" (Infrared images show that temperature changes from day to night indicate that it is a volcano.)

This means the behavior of the volcano's heat was observed through infrared images which record temperature.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ditaba difeng tseo e leng mafosisa ka mmelaellwa?","The correct answer is **B: O belaellwa a sebedisitse seqhomane**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the man is accused of using a ""seqhomane"" (a type of pickaxe or tool) to break into the cars. This is a key element of the accusation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: O ile a sebedisa koloi nakong ya tlhaselo (He used a car during the robbery):** While he used a car, the focus of the accusation isn't just on the car itself, but on the act of breaking into the cars.
* **C: Ba ikarabellang ba tseba hore na ke wa mohlobo o feng (The investigators know what ethnic group he belongs to):** Knowing his ethnic group is a detail, but not a core element of the accusation.
* **D: O ile a lemala (He escaped):**  The text doesn't mention anything about him escaping. It states he was arrested *after* evidence was found.



"
Ke ditaba difeng tseo ba boholong ba ileng ba di tiisa tse amanang le tlhaselo?,"The correct answer is **B: Mohlobo wa mmelaellwa (Ethnic background)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the suspect is known to be a member of the Uyghur ethnic group. This ethnic background is a key piece of information that links him to the potential act of terrorism.
* The other options are less direct:
    * **A: Boitsebiso ba batho ba entseng tlolo ya molao le babelaellwa (The confession of those who committed the crime and are arrested)** - While confessions are important in investigations, they aren't presented as the *initial* trigger for suspicion.
    * **C: Sepheo sa tlhaselo (Terrorist ideology)** - The passage doesn't mention any ideological links.
    * **D: Lebitso le fane ya mmelaellwa (The name given to the suspect)** - The suspect's name is unknown, so this is not relevant.

Therefore, the known ethnic background is the most immediate and relevant piece of information connecting the individual to potential terrorism and warranting the arrest.
"
Ke dihlopha difeng tse tla bapala papaling e tla tshwarelwa Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Afrika Borwa le Australia**.

The text states: ""Papadi ya bofelo ya letoto e tla ba Ellis Park mane Johannesburg bekeng e tlang, moo di-Springbok di tla bapala kgahlanong le Australia."" which translates to ""The final match of the series will be at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, where the Springboks will play against Australia.""
"
Sehlopha sa Springboks se tla bapala papadi ya sona e hlahlamang hokae?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Papadi ya bofelo ya letoto e tla ba Ellis Park mane Johannesburg bekeng e tlang..."" which translates to ""The final match of the series will be at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week...""
"
Ke mathata a feng ao sepalangwang sa ho ya sepakapakeng se ileng sa kopana le ona nakong ya letsholo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho fumana boikutlo bo tsitsitseng hape (To regain stable attitude)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the satellite's attitude drifted due to the lack of gyroscope expectation during the flight. This resulted in the need to re-establish the satellite's normal attitude. The mention of attitude adjustment thrusters and the Russian ground control recalibrating the satellite's attitude reinforces this point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho boloka sebaka se lekaneng hole le difehli (To maintain a safe distance from debris):** While debris avoidance is a concern in spaceflight, it's not the primary issue described in the passage.
*   **B: Ho boloka sesebediswa sa gyroscope (To maintain gyroscope operation):** The problem *was* the lack of gyroscope expectation, meaning the gyroscopes weren't functioning as anticipated, not the other way around.
*   **C: Ho tlosa sefofane (To release a thruster):** The text mentions *using* attitude adjustment thrusters, not releasing them.

Therefore, the passage focuses on the difficulty in regaining stable attitude due to a problem with the expected function of the gyroscopes.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, sepheo sa sepalangwang sa sepakapakeng e ne e le sefe?","The correct answer is **A: Ho fumana sesebediswa sa gyroscope se lahlehileng.**

The passage states: ""Seteishene se tswelletse ka althitute ya sona, ho sa natswe tahlehelo ya gyroscope pejana leetong la seteisheneng sa sepakapaka..."" which translates to ""The station drifted to its own attitude, without a gyroscope correction in the station...""  This indicates the gyroscope was malfunctioning or not functioning correctly, and finding a working one was needed.

The other options are not directly supported by the text:

* **B: Ho atamela katoloso ya difehli:** (To fix the expansion of failures) - There's no mention of failures expanding.
* **C: Ho phethela tshebetso ya sepakapakeng e kantle ho sepalangwang:** (To complete the spacecraft operation in the unstable state) - The focus is on correcting the attitude, not completing the operation in an unstable state.
* **D: Ho fofisa difofane:** (To pump the thrusters) - While thrusters were used for attitude adjustment, the passage emphasizes the need for a working gyroscope.

Therefore, the most logical inference is that they needed to find a working gyroscope to correct the attitude.
"
Ke polelo efe ho tse latelang eo e seng nnete ka nyewe ee?,"The correct answer is **D: AOL ene e qoswa (AOL itself was shut down)**.

Here's why:

* **A: E ne e sekasekwa sebakeng seo e leng ntlo-kgolo ya AOL (It was located in the place that is the AOL headquarters):** This is true according to the passage.
* **B: Molato o ile wa fumanwa (The law was found):** This is true. The passage explicitly states that the law was used to block spam.
* **C: Molao o thibelang phetiso ya melaetsa ya lefofo ka marang-rang a email (The law that prevents the sending of unsolicited email messages):** This accurately describes the purpose of the law mentioned in the passage.
* **D: AOL ene e qoswa (AOL itself was shut down):**  While AOL's prominence has diminished, the passage doesn't mention that AOL was shut down.  AOL still exists, although it's a shadow of its former self. Therefore, this statement is false based on the information provided.



"
Ke polelo efe e hlalosang ka nepo nyewe yee?,"The correct answer is **C: Nyewe e ile ya sekasekwa ka selemo sa 2003**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Lena ke lekgetlo la pele moo kahlolo e fumanweng ka ho sebedisa molao o fetisitsweng ka 2003 ho thibela imeile e ngata, e leng se bitswang spam..."" This directly links the new law to the year 2003, and the new law is the reason for the seizure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL e ile ya qoswa ka phano ya thepa ntle le tumellano:** While AOL was likely involved, the passage doesn't mention the method of seizure or if it was without agreement. It focuses on *why* it was seized.
* **B: Nyewe ene kenyeletsa ditsi tse ka sehloohong tsa marang-rang:** The passage doesn't detail what the seized items were.
* **D: AOL e ile ya susumemetsa ho sekasekwa hwa nyewe:**  The passage states a law *was used* to seize the newe, not that AOL initiated the seizure.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sehlopha sefe seo Vidal a qalileng ho se bapalla dihleng tse tharo tse fitileng?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The question asks where Vidal started playing for the last three seasons. The text states: ""Vidal ya dilemo tse 28 o kenetse sehlopha sa Barça dihleng tse tharo tse fetileng, ho tswa Sevilla."" This translates to: ""Vidal at the age of 28 joined the Barça squad for the last three seasons, coming from Sevilla.""
"
Vidal o bapetse dipapadi tse kae tsa Barca?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Vidal o bapetse dipapadi tse 49 bakeng sa tlelapa."" which translates to ""Vidal has played 49 matches for the team.""
"
Sehlopha se seng e ne e le sefe papading eo?,"The correct answer is **A: Jargue**.

The text states: ""Jarque o ne a ikwetlisa boikwetlisong ba pele ho sehla mane Coverciano naheng ya Italy pejana kajeno."" This translates to ""Jarque was preparing for the first training session in Coverciano, Italy yesterday.""  The question asks what the team was for the event.  Since the text says Jarque was preparing for the first training session in Coverciano, it indicates the team involved was Jargue.
"
Hobaneng Jargue a ne a dula hoteleng?,"The correct answer is **B: O ile a ba le kopano ya pele ya sehla se qala** (He had his first meeting of the training camp).

Here's why:

The sentence states: ""Jarque o ne a ikwetlisa boikwetlisong ba pele ho sehla mane Coverciano naheng ya Italy pejana kajeno."" This translates to ""Jarque was training during the first training camp in Coverciano, Italy yesterday.""

The phrase ""ho sehla mane"" means ""in the training camp.""  Therefore, option B accurately reflects the information in the original sentence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ne a na le boikwetliso** (He had a training): This is too general. While he was training, the sentence specifies it was a camp.
*   **C: O ne a na le papadi ka Sontaha** (He had an appointment with Sontaha): The sentence mentions a planned match against Bologna, but not a specific appointment with Sontaha.
*   **D: O ne a ikwetlisa le sehlopha sa Bolonia** (He was training with the Bologna team): The sentence refers to a planned match *against* Bologna, not training *with* them.



"
Hobaneng mokhatlo wa mahlale a a tsa tlhaho wa Jakarta o sa ka wa etsa temoso?,"The correct answer is **D: E ne e sa fihlele liphelo tse hlokahalang tsa ho reketla.**

Here's why:

* **The problem states a magnitude 6.5 earthquake occurred and a tsunami warning was issued.**  The warning was based on that earthquake.
* **The question asks *why* the relevant authorities in Jakarta *couldn't* prevent the panic.**
* **Option D directly addresses the issue of communication.** If the warning didn't reach the people who needed to hear it, they wouldn't have had the opportunity to evacuate, regardless of the earthquake's magnitude.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ho ne ho se na kotsi ya tsunami (There was no tsunami risk):** This is incorrect. The text explicitly states a tsunami warning was issued.
* **B: Ho qoba pherekano ya baahi (Preventing the panic of the people):** While preventing panic is a goal, it doesn't address the *reason* why the panic occurred. The panic was a result of the credible warning.
* **C: Ho qoba tahlehelo ya khwebo ya baahi (Preventing the disruption of people's businesses):** This is a secondary consequence and not the core issue of why people panicked.  Evacuation for safety would supersede business concerns.



Therefore, the inability to reach the people at risk is the primary reason the authorities couldn't prevent the panic.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho reketla ho bakile eng?","The correct answer is **B: Kotsi ya tsunami**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ho latela lekalana la jiofisikse la Jakarta, ha ho tlhokomediso ya tsunami e tla phatlalatswa hobane ho reketla ha lefatshe ha ho a fihlella tlhoko ya matla a 6.5. Leha ho na le tshosetso ya tsunami..."" (Following the geophysical measurement of Jakarta, a tsunami warning will be issued because the earthquake reached a magnitude of 6.5... Although there is a tsunami alert...).

While the earthquake (magnitude 6.5) is *the reason* for the warning, the warning itself is about the *tsunami risk*.
"
Ke ntho efe ho tse latelang e susumetsang mesebetsi ya Letsatsi le dinaledi tse ling?,"The correct answer is **D: Khanya ya dintho tse sebakeng,nomoro e se nang tekanyo le ho potoloha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tshebetso ya dinaledi tsohle tse sistiming e fumanwe hore e qhojwa ke kganya ya tsona, potoloho ya tsona, ke phetho."" (The operation of all system economies has been found to be driven by its magnitude, rate, and outcome.)
* **It also connects this to solar activity:** ""Khanya ya dintho tse sebakeng le phallo ya plasma"" (The magnitude and rate of solar activity) are directly linked to the Rossby number, which in turn affects magnetic activity. 
* **Therefore, the factors of magnitude, rate (velocity/frequency), and intensity (brightness) all play a role in driving the solar and other economic activities mentioned in the passage.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khanya ya dintho tse sebakeng le phallo ya plasma:**  While important, this doesn't encompass *all* the factors mentioned in the passage (magnitude and rate).
* **B: Nomoro e se nang tekanyo,ho potoloha le matla a khohedi:** The passage mentions ""phetho"" (outcome) but not specifically ""matla a khohedi"" (electrical power). While related, it's not the core of the explanation.
* **C: Ho potoloho le le khanya ya dintho tse sebakeng:**  This is incomplete as it leaves out ""magnitude"" (size/intensity) and ""outcome.""



"
Nomoro e se nang tekanyo ya naledi e fumanwa jwang?,"The correct answer is **B: Phallo e kae ya plasma (Rossby wave)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kganya le potoloho ya tsona di sebediswa mmoho ho fumana palo ya Rossby ya naledi, amanang le phallo ya plasma.""  This directly connects the Rossby number (a characteristic of the wave) to the wave itself. The Rossby number *is* derived from the wave's characteristics, specifically its amplitude and frequency (which are related to plasma dynamics).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khanya ya dintho tse sebakeng le ho potoloha:** While electromagnetic waves involve light and frequency, this isn't the *direct* method for determining the Rossby number in the context of this text.
* **C: Boemo ba ho kena tshebetsong:** This is a general term and doesn't specifically relate to how the Rossby number is obtained.
* **D: Ditekanyetso tsa phetoho ho matla a khohedi:** This relates to electrical power dynamics, not the wave characteristics of a magnetosphere.



Therefore, the best answer is B.
"
"Lekgolong, ke karolo e kae ya batho e tshehetsang mohato wa hore naha ya Austrilia e fetohe rephaboliki hang-hang?","The correct answer is **A: Diperesente tse 31**.

The passage states: ""diperesente tse 31 di dumela hore Australia le ka mohla ha e a lokela ho ba riphaboliki."" (31 percent agreed that Australia should become a republic sooner rather than later.)
"
"Ho ya ka Julie Gillard, Austrilia e lokela ho ba rephaboliki?","The correct answer is **B: Kamora puso ya Mofumahadi Elizabeth wa bobedi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tonakgolo ya mokobobo Julia Gillard o boletse nakong ya boiketo ba dikgetho tsa bofederale tsa 2010 hore o dumela hore Australia e tlameha ho ba riphaboliki qetellong ya botlotlehi ba Mofumahadi Elizabeth II.""  This directly indicates that according to Julia Gillard, Australia should become a republic *after* Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
"
Ke mokhatlo o feng o tlasa dipatlisiso tsa molao?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokhatlo wa Planned Parenthood**.

The passage explicitly states that the legal scrutiny is targeting the Planned Parenthood organization (""Leano la Komen le bolaile matla a mokgatlo wa Thero ya Malapa...""). The subsequent paragraphs detail the investigation related to Planned Parenthood's funding and the involvement of Congressman Cliff Stearns.
"
Cliff Stears ke mookamedi ya komiti efe?,"The correct answer is **D: Komitjana ya leihlo le nchocho le lipatlisiso**

Here's why:

The text states that Cliff Stearns is on the ""House Committee on Oversight and Investigations,"" which is also referred to as the ""Committee on Energy and Commerce"" (which oversees the subcommittee). Option D best reflects this description.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mokhatlo wa Motlakase wa Hae le Komiti ya Moruo:** While he might be involved in energy-related matters, this isn't the specific committee mentioned.
*   **B: Mokhatlo wa Komen:**  The text states the Komen Foundation was affected by his investigation, but it doesn't say he is a member of Komen.
*   **C: Mokhatlo wa Planned Parenthood:**  The text explicitly mentions Planned Parenthood being investigated *because* of Stearns' scrutiny of how funds were being used. Stearns is *investigating* them, not a member of their organization.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ha ho wa etsahalang ka mosadi wa Switzerland?","The correct answer is **A: Thepa ya hae e neng e utswitswe e fumanwe** (Her stolen belongings were found).

The text states, ""re tshwere batho ba bahlano ba betileng mosadi wa moSwiss mme ra fumana selefounu ya hae le laptop"" which translates to ""we arrested five people who had kidnapped a Swiss woman and found her phone and laptop."" This means her stolen belongings were found. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Ke khampani efe e abetsweng khau ya Taiwan Sustainable Award ka selemo sa 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""Empa mmaraka wa moreki khomputeng ya """"laptop"""" ya hae o tla fapanngwa ka tsela e kgolo kamora hore **ASUS** e abelwe Kgau ya Tswelletso ya Taiwan ya 2007..."" (But the market for its ""laptop"" customer will change greatly after **ASUS** was awarded the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award...)
"
ASUS Eee PC ke mofuta ofeng wa komporo?,"The correct answer is **B: Lepothopo (Laptop)**.

The text explicitly states: ""ASUS Eee PC, eo pejana e thakgotsweng lefatseng ho pota bakeng sa dintlha tse baballang ditjeo tsa tshebetso, e leng sehlooho, e bile sehlooho se tjhesang mane ho 2007 Taipei IT Month.

This directly translates to: ""ASUS Eee PC, which was previously launched worldwide for its impressive performance specifications, is a notebook, and has a four-inch screen at the 2007 Taipei IT Month. But its market for its """"laptop"""" computer will be greatly changed and transformed after ASUS received the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China.""  The text consistently refers to it as a ""notebook"" which is another term for a laptop.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Lepothopo (Laptop)**.
"
Ke mang ya neng a na le boikarabelo thepeng e nyametseng ya poso?,"The correct answer is **C: Moshemane**.

The text states: ""Maobane, poso e phatlaladitse kopo ya tshwarelo ya yona ho baahi le ho masedinyana kamora ho sibolla hore **moshanyana o ne a patile ditokomane tse fetang tse 600 tsa poso**..."" (Therefore, the post office announced a replacement application to residents and small businesses after discovering that **a boy had stolen over 600 postal documents**...).  This clearly identifies the boy as the one who had the crucial role in the missing mail.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya kopileng tshwarelo mabapi le ditokomane tse nyametseng?","The correct answer is **D: Poso ya Obanazawa**.

The text states: ""poso e phatlaladitse kopo ya tshwarelo ya yona ho baahi..."" which translates to ""the Obanazawa post office announced a replacement application to the residents..."" This clearly indicates the post office is the one requesting the replacement.
"
Del Patro o ile a hloka ho bua bothata ba hae ba lehetla neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Pele ho kgefutso ya kamora hore dintlha di lekane lekgetlo la pele.**

Here's why:

The question states that Del Potro had an advantage in the second set, but the set went to a tiebreak after reaching 6-6. The question further mentions that he had to talk about his problem *before* the first point of the tiebreak. This indicates he was addressing an issue during the changeover after the score reached 6-6.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mokgahlelong wa pele:** This refers to the changeover between the first and second games, which is unlikely to be when he discusses a problem that would affect the tiebreak.
* **C: Mokgahlelong wa bobedi:**  This refers to the changeover between the second and third games. While possible, the context points to a problem stemming from the imminent tiebreak.
* **D: Kamora kgefutso ya ha dintlha di lekane lekgetlo la boraro:** This is after the tiebreak has already started, which is not what the question describes.



"
Sephetho sa dintlha tse neng di lekana lekgetlo la pele ho kgefutso ke sefe?,"The correct answer is **D: E hapilwe ke Del Potro mokgahlelong wa bobedi**.

Here's why:

The question asks what happened in the first set after the score reached a tiebreak. The text says: ""Potro o fumane monyetla wa pele (advantage) seteng ya bobedi, empa sena le sona sa hloka tie break kamora ho fihlela 6-6."" This means the first set went to a tiebreak, and Del Potro won that tiebreak.
"
"Jwalo kaha ho boletswe, ke mang ya ileng a kopana le mokudi ka kotloloho?","The correct answer is **B: Bana**.

The passage states: ""Kajeno, re ithutile hore bana ba bang ba boholo ba ho kena sekolo ba tsebahaditswe ba bile le kopano le mokudi."" (Yesterday, we learned that some older children entering school have been exposed and have had contact with a predator.) Therefore, the children are the ones who had contact with the predator.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ha mmusisi a bua le baahi ba Texas ha a ka a fana ka tiisetso efe?","The correct answer is **B: Ho na le dintho tse ntseng di etswa ho sireletsa setjhaba.**

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Perry, with solemnity, noted that there are very few places in the world with the capability to fulfill the mission of this office."" This implies action is being taken.
* He also says, ""Today, we learned that older children have been threatened while entering school and have had contact with an intruder."" This indicates problems are being addressed.
* However, he *doesn't* offer a guarantee that the system is working perfectly (""Dula o tshepile hore sisitimi ya rona e sebetsa hantle ka moo e lokang."" translates to ""Please trust that our system is working well where it should.""), and the situation is clearly serious (""Boemo bona bo mahlonoko haholo"" means ""This situation is very serious"").

Therefore, the most accurate statement he can make is that *something* is being done to protect the public.



"
Baithuti ba babedi ba mehleng ba sekolo sa UW ba entse mohlodi ofe wa lenaneo la ditaba tsa boswasi?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage states: ""Haesale ho tloha qalong ya yona, The Onion e bile ntlokgolo ya ditaba tsa nnete tse tlalehwang ka boswaswi..."" This directly identifies The Onion as the satirical news program. The other options are mentioned in the context of the passage but are not the answer to the question.
"
"Ho latela seratswana see, ke eng e sa kenyeletswang ka hara ditaba tsa boswaswi tsa The Onion?","The correct answer is **A: Mmapa wa lefatshe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly lists the following as part of The Onion's offerings:

*   **Katiso ya dingolwa** (Written articles)
*   **Webosaete e hohetseng** (A website)
*   **Dipapatso tsa botho** (Publications)
*   **Netweke ya ditaba ya dihoreng** (A network of radio news)
*   **Dipodkaste** (Podcasts)
*   **Moraorao ho thakgolwa ha atlelase ya lefatshe e bitswang Our Dumb World** (Recognition as a world-renowned institution called Our Dumb World)

A world map is not mentioned in the passage as being part of what The Onion offers. Therefore it is the only option that isn't included in the text.
"
Ho ya ka seratswana ke eng e neng e lebelwa ke mapolesa?,"The correct answer is **A: Trafalgar Square**.

The text states: ""ba feta Trafalgar Square..."" which means they passed Trafalgar Square.  The other options are locations the protesters *went to*, but not where the police *expected* them to go or a location they were focused on preventing access to.
"
Ke nako efe eo mapolesa a kopileng baipelaetsi ho sutha e le ho qoba phallo e phahameng ya sephethephethe?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka 11:20**.

The passage states: ""Ka 11:20, mapolesa a kopile baipelaetsi ho tjhetjhela peifementeng..."" which translates to ""At 11:20, the police met the protesters to...""

Therefore, the police met the protesters to discuss the blockade at 11:20.
"
Ke eng eo e leng nnete ka dipatlisiso tse entsweng ke Dr.Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Ditweba tse ding tse neng di na le lefu la tswekere ha di sa na lona.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ngaka Ehud Ur, moprofesara wa bongaka mane Dalhousie University... o hlokomedisitse hore patlisiso ena e sa le sethathong... o sa le leqe mabapi le hore na lefu la tswekere le ka phekolwa, a bolela hore ditshibollo tsena ha di na kamano le batho ba se ntse ba na le lefu la tswekere la Mofuta wa 1.""
* This means the study found that the identified cells *no longer had* the characteristics of cancerous cells.  Therefore, cells that *used to have* cancer characteristics *no longer did*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Diphetho di ka ba molemo ho bakudi ba lefu la tswekere la Mofuta wa 1:** The text explicitly says the findings *aren't related to* Type 1 diabetes.
* **C: O na le tshepo ya hore tse fumanweng boithutong di ka lebisa phekong:** Dr. Ur is being cautious and *doesn't claim* the findings will lead to a cure.
* **D: Tse ding tsa ditweba tse neng di sena lefu la tswekere dina le lefu la tswekere:** The study showed the cells *lost* their cancerous properties, not that they retained them.



"
"Ho latela seratswana see, Dr. Ur o belaela eng?","The correct answer is **B: Haeba pheko e ka khoneha**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""o sa le leqe mabapi le hore na lefu la tswekere le ka phekolwa..."" which translates to ""he does not believe that diabetes can be cured...""

Dr. Ur is essentially stating he *doesn't* think diabetes can be cured. Therefore, the question asks what Dr. Ur *denies*, which is the possibility of a cure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haeba diphetho e le tse dumellanang le bakudi ba lefu la tswekere la Mofuta wa 1** - The text doesn't mention anything about the findings aligning with Type 1 diabetes patients.
*   **C: Maikutlo a ditsebi tse ding malebana le pheko** - Dr. Ur's statement is *not* about the opinions of other experts; it's his own.
*   **D: Haeba ditweba tse se nang lefu la tsaekere di tl dula di le jwalo** - The text is about the diabetes and how the trials are not considered standard and thus nothing can be assumed."
Ke polelo efe e sa hlaloseng ka nepo ho swahlamana hwa sefofane sa CG4684?,"The correct answer is **A: Sefofane se sitilwe ho tsorama ka lebaka la maemo a lehodimo** (The plane was forced to land due to bad weather).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Letscholo la ho batla le sitisitswe ke maemo a mabe a lehodimo a bakileng hore sefofane se nyahlatse ho tsorama."" (The search was suspended due to bad weather which caused the plane to be forced to land).
* **Option A directly reflects this cause.**
* **Options B, C, and D** are not directly supported by the provided text. While the plane was found in a location, the text doesn't specify it's far from a town. It also doesn't mention multiple attempts to land before the crash. And while weather contributed to the suspension of search efforts, the text does not say that bad weather prevented the searchers from exploring the crash site.



"
Ke eng se bakileng ho re sefofane sa CG4684 se khethe ho se tsorame?,"The correct answer is **D: Maemo a lehodimo a ne a se matle.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Letsholo la ho batla le sitisitswe ke maemo a mabe a lehodimo a bakileng hore sefofane se nyahlatse ho tsorama."" (The search effort was suspended due to bad weather which prevented the plane from flying.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sebaka sa ho tsorama se ne se sa fihlelehe:** While difficult terrain was a factor in preventing rescuers from reaching the crash site, it didn't directly *cause* the plane to not fly.
* **B: Ho ne ho ena le difofane tse mmalwa kapela CG4684:** The passage doesn't mention any other planes being close to CG4684.
* **C: Sefofane se ile sa lebiswa sebakeng sa Kokoda:** The passage says the plane was *going* to Kokoda, not that it had arrived.

Therefore, the bad weather was the direct cause of the plane not being able to fly.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe ho tse latelang eo eleng nnete ka boiphihlelo ba Francizek Kowal?","The correct answer is **D: O ile a lemala ha a leka ho tjhwatla fensetere.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""E nngwe ya dikgalase ya qetella e pshatlehile, mme ba qala ho tswa ka fenstere,"" ho rialo lehlatsipa Franciszek Kowal. (One of the last windows opened, and they started to escape through the window, said eyewitness Franciszek Kowal.)

This indicates that Kowal *witnessed* people escaping, and implies he observed the event.  Option D, ""O ile a lemala ha a leka ho tjhwatla fensetere"" translates to ""He observed when he tried to open the window"", implying that he was observing the action, not actively attempting to open it. The text doesn't state he tried to open it himself.  He's an eyewitness reporting what he saw.
"
Hobaneng ho se bobebe ho lepa tshenyo ya sefefo sa Danielle?,"The correct answer is **A: Sefefo se lepuwa hore e tla ba lehodiotswana le leholo** (The storm is forecast to become a major hurricane).

Here's why:

* **The question asks why it's difficult to estimate the potential damage.** The text states that Danielle is far from land. 
* **A major hurricane has a much larger potential for damage than a tropical storm.** The forecast of becoming a major hurricane significantly increases the potential for widespread destruction. This makes estimating damage more challenging.
* **B is incorrect** because the text *does* provide information about the storm's current wind speed.
* **C is incorrect** because the storm is *near* land (the Atlantic Ocean and the US/Caribbean).
* **D is incorrect** because the storm being near Miami is *relevant* to damage estimation – it increases the risk to those areas.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe ho tse latelang eo e seng nnete ka lehodiotswana Danielle?","The correct answer is **A: Tshenyo ya lona sebakeng sa Caribbean ha e tsebahale (Its effects in the Caribbean are unknown)**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Hobane sefefo sena se sa le hole le ho fihla naheng, ho sa le thata ho lekanya kgonahalo ya ditlamorao tsa sona naheng ya United States kapa Caribbean."" (Because this storm is not far from making landfall, it is not difficult to measure the damage of its effects in the United States or the Caribbean.)
*   This implies that the effects *are* being monitored and are a concern in the Caribbean.
*   The other options are directly supported by the text:
    *   **B: Le ile la qala Lewatleng la Antlantic (It originated in the Atlantic Ocean)** - The text states this directly.
    *   **C: Le ka qetella le fetohile lehodiotswana (It could eventually become a hurricane)** - The text mentions scientists predict it might strengthen to a hurricane.
    *   **D: Le haufi le lebopo la lewatle (It is close to the coast)** - The text says it's not far from making landfall.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho nahanwa hore ho lokela ho etsahale eng ka lefu pele e ka ba sewa se amang lefatshe ka kakaretso?","The correct answer is **B: Matshwao a bokudi a lokela a dule ele a bobebe.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the concern is that the virus could spread globally *if* people are infected but show mild or no symptoms. This implies that the key factor in the virus becoming a global pandemic is the ability of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals to continue their daily lives and unknowingly transmit the virus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Le tlameha le se ke la bolaya haholo:** While the lethality of the virus is a factor, the main concern here is transmission, not necessarily death rate.
*   **C: Batho ba bangata ba lokela ho tshwaetswa:**  Quarantining many people is a response *to* a potential outbreak, not a condition *for* a global pandemic.
*   **D: Bana ba lokela ho ba le matshwao a bokudi:** The passage doesn't suggest that children *should* have mild symptoms; it's concerned about mild symptoms in the general population.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, sefefo se ne se le hole hakae le sebaka sa Fuji?","The correct answer is **D: Dikhilomethara tse 77**.

The text states: ""leihlo (kgubu ya sefefo) la Morakot le ne le le dikhilomitara tse mashome a supileng thoko le profensi ya Fujian ya China."" This translates to ""Typhoon Makorot was 70 kilometers off the coast and Fujian province of China.""  Since Fujian is the location, the distance from the coast to Fujian is approximately 77 kilometers.
"
Ke mang ya dumedisitseng George W. Bush hang ha a fihla Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng le Lee Hsien Loong**.

The text states: ""Mopresidente wa naha ya U.S. George W. Bush o fihlile Singapore hoseng ha la 16 Pudungwana, moo a qadileng leeto la hae la nako ya beke la Asia. O kgahlameditswe ke **Motlatsi wa Tonakgolo ya Singapore Wong Kan Seng** mme ba tshohla ditaba tse amang kgwebo le boferekanyi mmoho le **Tonakgolo ya Singapore Lee Hsien Loong**.""

This means he was greeted by both Wong Kan Seng (the Prime Minister of Singapore) and Lee Hsien Loong (the President of Singapore)."
Moperesidente o buile neng ka katoloso ya tsa khwebisano Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka mora ho hlolwa ke dikgetho tsa mahareng tsa nako ya puso.**

The passage states: ""Kamora beke ya ditahlehelo dikgethong tsa mahareng a sehla, Bush o jwetsitse bamamedi mabapi le katoloso ya kgwebo Asia."" This directly indicates that he spoke about Asian trade expansion *after* the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe ho tse latelang eo e leng sepheo se akaretsang sa mmuso?","The correct answer is **A: Ho tshehetsa ka ditjhelete mohato wa dikariki pele ho mafelo a Tlhakubele selemong sena.**

Here's why:

* The question asks about a broader government initiative. Option A correctly identifies the overall goal: funding a program (Tlhakubele) with government funds.
* Options B and C only mention the numbers of chicks, which are a *part* of the initiative but not the overall goal.
* Option D is incorrect because the text states they are *imolla* (to gather/collect) the chicks, implying they are aiming for a certain number, not reducing the number.

Therefore, option A is the most encompassing statement reflecting the government's action and purpose as described in the text."
Mmuso o ile wa phatlalatsa eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba rera ho tshetsa ka ditjhelete morero wa dikariki tse ding tse 1,300**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what the government announced.** The passage states ""Phatlalatso ya kajeno hape e atolohela boikitlaetsong ba mmuso bo entsweng ka Hlakubele selemong sena ho tshehetsa ka ditjhelete makeratjhe a tlatsetso. A mang a tlatsetso a 300 a tla tlisa kakaretso ho makaretjhe a 1,300 a tla fumanwa ho imolla matshweletshwele."" This translates to ""Today's announcement concerns the government's initiative established in July this year to fund a support program. A total of 300 grants will bring the total to 1,300 to be received to support resources."" This clearly indicates the government is announcing funding for 1,300 grants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba rera ho tshetsa ka ditjhelete morero wa dikariki tse ding tse 300** - This is incorrect because the passage states 1,300 grants, not 300.
* **B: Ba ikemiseditse ho imolla bothata ba dikariki** - While the program *might* help alleviate problems, the announcement is about the funding, not a commitment to resolve problems.
* **D: Bothata ba tshubuhlellano bo tla rarolwa ka Thlakubele** - This is incorrect. The announcement is about a program started in July, not a resolution to problems in July.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke taba efe e tsebahalang?","The correct answer is **A: Boemo ba tshoso bo fokotsehile**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Phokotso ya boemo ba tshosetso ho fihla ho bo mahlonoko..."" which translates to ""The decrease in the severity of the outbreak has reached a critical point...""  This directly indicates that the severity/level of the outbreak has decreased.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha ho sa na tshoso:** The passage explicitly mentions an expected resurgence (""tlhaselo e lebeletsweng""), meaning there is *not* no outbreak.
* **C: Tlhaselo e lebeletswe:** While a resurgence is expected, the main point is the *decrease in severity*.
* **D: Mautlowela a netefaditse hore tlhaselo e tla ba e kotsi:**  The passage doesn't mention any confirmation of the outbreak's danger level. It focuses on the decrease in severity.



"
Ke polelo efe mabapi le boipelaetso eo e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **B: Dikgetho tse neng li fitilwe ke nako di ile tsa baka boipelaetso (Ena ke boipelaetso bo nammeng kgahlaong le puso bo qadileng ka Mphalane.)**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that the President's commission *responded to* the failure to hold elections since 2011. It *didn't say* that the elections *caused* the commission. The commission was a reaction to the lack of elections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khomeshene ya moperesidente ebile karabo ho boipelaetso** - This is true. The commission *was* a response to the situation.
*   **C: Boipelaetso bo ne bo batla hore CEP wa pele a itokolle mosebetsing** - This is true. The commission *supported* the previous CEP stepping down.
*   **D: Ka dinako tse ding boipelaetso bone bo le kotsi** - The text doesn't mention that the commission was ever risky."
Ke mang ya ileng a kgothaletsa hore CEP ya ho qetela a itokolle?,"The correct answer is **C: Khomeshene ya moperesidente**.

The text states: ""Kgomishene ya bopresidente e kgothaleditse ho itokolla mosebetsing ha CEP ya pejana..."" which translates to ""The Presidential Commission supported the resignation of the previous CEP...""."
"Holatela seratswana,ke eng se sa tshehetswang ke dipapali tsa Gymnastics tsa Amerika ka morao hore Nassar a hlekefetse dibapadi?","The correct answer is **A: Ho amuhuwa setifikeite**.

The text indicates that refusing to issue certificates was something the Gymnastics federation *did* (as part of the changes they support), not something they *didn't* do. Therefore, the options B, C, and D are all things the Gymnastics federation *does* support.
"
"Holatela seratswana, ke sefe sepheo sa mantlha sa dibapadi tsa Gymnastics tsa Amerika le komiti ya diolimpiki ya Amerika?","The correct answer is **D: Ho kgothaletsa tikoloho e bolokehileng bakeng sa dibapadi**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mokgatlo wa Dijimnastiki wa USA le USOC di na le sepheo se tshwanang — e leng ho etsa hore papadi ya dijimnastiki, le tse ding, e bolokehe ka hohle ka moo ho ka kgonehang hore baatlelete ba latele ditoro tsa bona tikolohong e bolokehileng, e molemo mme e matlafaditsweng."" (The USA Gymnastics and USOC share the same goal - to make the gymnastics community, and others, as safe as possible so that athletes can follow their routines in a safe, positive, and strengthened environment.)

While options A, B, and C are related to the situation, they aren't the *central* shared goal. The central shared goal is safety.



"
Sekepe se ne se lebile kae ha ketsahalo e etsahala? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text states: ""Sekepe sa sehlopha sa Avenger sa mehato e kgahlanong le dibomo tsa metsing, sekepe sena se ne se le tseleng ya sona ho ya Puerto Princesa mane Palawan."" (The Avenger-class ship, part of the sea control warfare group, was en route to Puerto Princesa and Palawan.)
"
Ke eng e boletsweng seratswaneng e seng nnete ka sekepe?,"The correct answer is **B: Se fumaneha sehlekehlekeng sa Palawan**.

The text states: ""Se anetswe U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet mme se boemakepeng ba Sasebo, Nagasaki mane Japan.""  This means the ship was *going to* Puerto Princesa, but it *was based* in Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan. It doesn't say it was found shipwrecked in Palawan.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Se ne se le tseleng e yang Puerto Princesa:** The text explicitly states the ship was ""ho ya Puerto Princesa mane Palawan.""
* **C: Ke sekepe se thibelang liqhomane:** The text mentions the ship was involved in ""mehato e kgahlanong le dibomo tsa metsing,"" suggesting it's a ship designed to deal with underwater threats, which could include preventing landings.
* **D: Se fuwe mokhahlelo wa Sventh Fleet wa sesole sa Amerika sa metsing:** The text clearly says ""Se anetswe U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet.""



"

The text states: ""Ha morao ka Sontaha, Mopresidente wa United States, **Donald Trump**,...o phatlaladitse hore mabotho a naha ya US a tla tswa naheng ya Syria."" (After Sunday, the President of the United States, **Donald Trump**, announced that US troops will leave Syria...)
"
"Ho ya ka polelo, ke naha efe e nkileng boikarabello ba ho lebela batshwaruwa ba ntwa?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The text states: ""Hape Turkey e ne e tla nka tshebetso ya ho disa balwanedi ba tshwerweng ba ISIS bao..."". This translates to ""Also Turkey was going to take action to capture suspected ISIS militants..."".  Therefore, Turkey is the country taking responsibility for the militants.
"
Ho belaelwa sesosa sa kotsi ebile sefe?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebaka se dithabeng**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho swahlamana ho etsahetse hodimo sebakeng se dithabeng..."" (The conflict happened in a high-altitude area...).  The other options are related factors, but the *location* is specifically identified as a mountainous area.
"
Ke mofuteng ofe wa sebaka seo kotsi e etsahetseng?,"The correct answer is **D: Bo dithaba**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho swahlamana ho etsahetse hodimo sebakeng se dithabeng..."" which translates to ""The clash occurred in a high, mountainous area..."".  Therefore, the location is mountainous.
"
Ba boholong ba lebelletse eng ka tshepo ka mora likgohola?,"The correct answer is **A: Tsosoloso ya lehlabathe le lebopong la lewatle.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""baofisiri ba tshepa hore bo lekane ho busetsa dithibella tsa mela ya lehlabathe tse hoholetsweng tlase ke metsi."" This translates to: ""officials hoped it would be enough to prevent large spawning grounds for fish from being affected by rising water levels.""  The focus is on protecting fish spawning areas and the overall health of the marine ecosystem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tshimoloho ya mabopo a lewatle:** While the passage mentions whales, the primary concern is the effect on *fish* spawning grounds.
*   **C: Palo e eketsehileng ya dithlapi tsa humpback chubs:** The passage specifically mentions the humpback chub is at risk, but doesn't say the officials expected their population to increase.
*   **D: Sebaka sa dimela le diphoofolo tsa naheng:** The passage focuses solely on the marine environment and fish populations.

"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e amehileng ka ho sa feleng ke ho hahwa ha letamo?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlhapi tsa Hump chubs**.

The text highlights that humpback whales were significantly impacted by the decommissioning of the dam. They were likely dependent on the ecosystem that the dam supported, and its removal put them at risk.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Fish:** The text does not specifically mention the impact on fish populations.
*   **Ecosystem:** The text implies that the ecosystem was impacted but doesn't focus on the entire ecosystem.
*   **Ocean:** The text is more specific to the humpback whale's habitat."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya fileng Amerika menyenyetsi ka khonahalo ya tlhaselo?","The correct answer is **A: Marabele a Somalia**.

The text states that the US Embassy in Nairobi made the announcement regarding ""al-Shabaab militants from Somalia planning a terrorist attack in Kenya and Ethiopia."" Therefore, al-Shabaab is the group planning the attack.
"
Ke dipolelo dife ho tse latelang tse hlalosang ka nepo morero wa tlhaselo wa marabele?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho phahlola dibomo dibakeng tsa bohlokwa dinaheng tse pedi**.

The text explicitly states that the planned terrorist attacks are targeting Kenya **and** Ethiopia.  Therefore, the plan involves targeting bombs in **two** countries.
"
"Ho ba latelang, ke mang eo e seng ramolao?","The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Sakis Kechagioglou, George Nikolakopoulos, Petros Mantouvalos, and Evangelos Kalousis were all lawyers (boramolao).
* Makis Triantafylopoulos is identified as a journalist (moqolotsi wa ditaba).

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only one who is not a lawyer among the options provided.
"
Ke sehlopha sefe sa batho seo ho sa bolelwang se nkile karolo manyofonyofong kahara ditaba tsa molao ho setjhaba sa Magerike? ,"The correct answer is **A: Mofuta wa bo Ramolao wa Solicitors**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...baahlodi, boramolao, babuelli ba molao ba phahameng le ba tlase ba di entseng dilemong tse fetileng."" This translates to ""...leaders, lawyers, senior and junior legal representatives who have been involved in illegal activities in recent years.""  ""Boramolao"" translates to ""lawyers"" or ""legal professionals,"" and ""babuelle ba molao"" translates to ""legal representatives"" or ""legal agents,"" which includes solicitors. While the other options are mentioned, the core group being implicated in illegal activities is the legal profession.



"
India e lahlehetswe ke mekhahlelo e mekae ya di wicket?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""...kamora ho lahlehelwa ke wikete ya mokaptene India e fumane mabelo a 36 feela moo e lahlehetsweng ke diwikete tse 7 ho phethela makga a yona a papadi.""  This directly tells us India was dismissed for 7 wickets.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke dinthla tse ka hodimo ke tse kae tse fumanweng ka ho otlwa ha bolo ka bete?","The correct answer is **A: Di-run tse 70**.

The passage states: ""Robin Uthappa o fihletse dintlha tse phahameng ka ho fetisisa tsa lekga la papadi, mabelo a 70 ka dibolo tse 41 feela moo a otlileng bolo..."" which translates to ""Robin Uthappa reached the highest score in the tournament, 70 runs in just 41 balls...""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   Di-run tse 36 (36 runs) is the score of Sachin Tendulkar after getting out.
*   Di-run tse 100 (100 runs) is not mentioned in the passage.
*   Di-run tse 41 (41 runs) is the number of balls Robin Uthappa faced, not his score.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng e sa bakang pherekano ho Adam Cuerden?","The correct answer is **D: Mafosisa ka sesosa sa ho hlakola botaki ba Wales (Criticism of the investigation into the Wales's integrity).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Adam Cuerden is upset because he feels the investigation into his integrity was conducted unfairly. He claims they acted with prejudice and treated him as if he were a criminal.
* The passage also mentions public outcry and the resulting difficulties in planning for the future of the open-licensed dataset. This is a consequence *of* the investigation, not the cause of Cuerden's upset.
* Options A, B, and C are either unrelated or not the primary reason for his upset. The focus is on the perceived unfairness of the investigation itself.



Therefore, option D best reflects the reason for Adam Cuerden's dissatisfaction.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana see, ke eng e hlakotsweng ho marangrang?","The correct answer is **A: Botaki**.

The text states: ""...ka ho ikgakanya jwalo ka ha eka o re mametse, ho fihlela hantle ho phumulweng ha botaki ba hae."" This directly indicates that Adam Cuerden's right to privacy was violated.

While the text mentions other things (news, open-licensed data, community plans), the core issue being discussed is the violation of his privacy.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke eng e sa tshehetsweng ke Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **A: Ho kenyeletsa bahlabani ba basadi diolimpiking**.

The text explicitly states that Amir Khan said women shouldn't box. Therefore, supporting female Olympic boxers is something he *doesn't* support. The text also confirms he *did* support the British Olympic boxers in 2012, contradicting option B. Options C and D are not directly mentioned or implied.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng eo Amir Khan a tla e tshehetsa ho sa tsotellehe maikutlo a hae?","The correct answer is **C: Diolimpiki tsa selemo sa 2012**.

The text states that although Amir Khan previously said he didn't think women should box, he *would* support the British Olympic boxers in 2012. Therefore, the answer is 2012 Olympics.
"
Peter Lenz o hlokahetse neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Sepetlele**.

The text states: ""Ha a ntse a le lekgeng la boikwetliso ba hae, Lenz a wa sethuthuthung sa hae, mme yaba o thulwa ke mopalami e mong wa mohlodisani Xavier Zayat. O ile a hlahlojwa hanghang ke ba bongaka ba lebaleng la mejaho le ho iswa sepetlele se haufinyane moo a ileng a shwa ha morao."" 

This translates to: ""As he was at risk of injury, Lenz crashed his motorcycle and was hit by another racer, Xavier Zayat. He was immediately examined by the race medical team and taken to a nearby hospital where he died.""

Therefore, he needed to go to the hospital.
"
Ke mang Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Sebapadi se seng**.

The passage states that Xavier Zayat is ""mopalami e mong wa mohlodisani"" (another racer). This means he is a fellow racer, not a doctor, medical personnel, or agent.
"
Ke maemong afe ao mopalami wa sefofane ya tshohileng a ka nnang a una molemo ka ho utlwisisa tshebetso ya ka hare ya sefofane?,"The correct answer is **B: Haeba ho se rate ho fofa hwa bona ho bakwa ke tshabo eo ba sa tsebeng na e tswa kae.**

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding how a motorcycle works and what happens during riding can help manage fear related to unfamiliar or uncontrollable things. Option B directly aligns with this: the rider is fearful of riding (something unfamiliar and potentially uncontrollable) and doesn't know the source of that fear.  Understanding the mechanics of the motorcycle could alleviate that fear.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Haeba mopalami a hlajwa ke dihlong ke tshabo ya hae:** While fear is present, it's attributed to the rider's fear itself, not specifically to the motorcycle's operation.
*   **C: Haeba mopalami a sa rate mefuta yohle ya dipalangwang:** This is unrelated to fear of motorcycles; it's about a general dislike of things.
*   **D: Haeba matshweyeho a hae a bakwa ke diketsahalo tse sithabetsang empa di sa amane le ho fofa:** This describes a positive experience that doesn't directly relate to overcoming fear of riding.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what a travel agent *should* do.** The prompt emphasizes the importance of comparing prices and researching before booking a motorcycle trip. 
* **Option C directly addresses this.**  Comparing prices across multiple travel companies is the core of finding the best deal and making an informed decision.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

* **A: Ho sheba dinyehlisetso tse etswang ke dikhampani tsa maeto (Checking offers from travel companies):** While checking offers is helpful, it's only one part of the process. Comparison is crucial.
* **B: Ho lefella leeto khampaning ya maeto ka kotloloho (Paying for the trip directly to a travel company):** This is premature.  The travel agent's role is to help *find* the best option *before* payment.
* **D: Ho sheba marangrang a difofane (Checking motorcycle websites):** While researching motorcycle websites is a good idea, it doesn't address the travel *arrangement* aspect. The travel agent should be comparing overall trip packages, not just the motorcycles themselves.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng eo baeti ba tshwanelang ho e etsa pele e le ho beheletsa leeto le ditjeo di bobebe?","The correct answer is **B: Ho bapisa ditjeo ho marangrang a mang**.

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes the importance of comparing prices and researching before booking a flight and hotel. Option B directly reflects this advice.  The text explicitly states that comparing prices on various flight websites is beneficial.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho sheba marangrang a difofane:** While checking airline websites is good, the text suggests comparing across *multiple* websites.
* **C: Ho lefella ka kotloloho ho khamphani ya difofane:** This is premature. You should compare options *before* committing to a booking.
* **D: Ho lefella ka kotloloho ho ejente ya maeto:**  While using a travel agent *can* be an option, the text emphasizes doing your own research and comparison first.

Therefore, option B is the most aligned with the advice given in the text.
"
Motho eo o tsamayang le yena o lebeletswe ho felehetsa thepa neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ha thepa e posetswa ka kotloloho sebakeng seo mopalami a yang ho sona.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that the fastest way to get things done is to have them transported ""as if they were inspected inside a heart."" This implies a direct and immediate delivery to the recipient's location. Option C, ""Ha thepa e posetswa ka kotloloho sebakeng seo mopalami a yang ho sona,"" means the item is directly delivered to the place where the recipient is, which aligns with the passage's core idea of speed and directness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha dintho di romelwa ka sefofane:** The passage states that shipping by plane is *slower*.
*   **B: Ha khamphani e sebedisa difofane tsa yona:** While large companies might have their own fleets, the passage focuses on the general issue faced by smaller businesses.
*   **D: Ha thepa e tsamaiswa ke khamphani e kholo:** The passage addresses the difficulties faced by *smaller* businesses.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ha o khetha sefofane sa Frequent Flyer sa selekane, ke ntho e feng ya bohlokwa eo o lokelang ho e sheba?","The correct answer is **A: Khamphani ya difofane e fanang ka dintlha tse ngata** (Airline that offers more benefits).

Here's why: The question states that benefits vary greatly between different Frequent Flyer programs. Therefore, you should choose the airline offering the *most* benefits, not necessarily the biggest or the one you fly most often with. You want the best value for your points and miles.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke khamphani e feng ya difofane e ka nnang ya fana ka dintlha tse ngata ha motho a e sebedisa hangata?","The correct answer is **C: Khampani ya difofane eo o e sebedisang haholo selekaneng se fapaneng.**

Here's why:

* The question states that frequent flyer benefits *vary* between airlines.
* It asks which airline *typically* offers the most benefits for frequent use.
* Option C accurately reflects this – it's the airline you use *frequently* within a *specific* airline group (selected airline).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khamphani ya difofane e fapaneng, e selekaneng se fapaneng:** This is too general. The question is asking about which *specific* airline within a selection is best.
* **B: Khamphani ya difofane e sebediswang haholo selekaneng se tswanang:**  While it mentions frequent use, ""selekaneng se tswanang"" (similar selection) is vague and not specific to the question.
* **D: Khamphani ya difofane e fapaneng e selekaneng se tshwanang:**  Similar to A, this is too general.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly answers the question based on the provided text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke kutlo e fe e ka feliswang ke bokgoba ba tahi?","The correct answer is **C: Tatso**.

The passage states that alcohol affects the senses differently and that alcohol poisoning can cause loss of taste.
"
"Jwalo kaha ho hlalositswe seratswaneng, ke eng e ka fokotsang ditlamorao tsa jwala?","The correct answer is **C: Ho nwa jwala ka tekanyetso**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dintho tse ka amang bophelo ha nako etse e tsamaya ka lebaka la ho nwa haholo di akareletsa tshenyo ya sebete le bofofu le lefu. Kotsi e ka bang teng e eketseha haholo ha motho a nwa bojwala bo seng molaong.""  This indicates that excessive drinking is harmful.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Jwala bo thata bo ka eba le ditshila tse fapaneng tse kotsi tse akareletsang methanol, e ka bakang bofofu kapa lefu le ha ho nwewa e nyenyane."" This highlights the dangers of unregulated alcohol, especially methanol.
* **Therefore, drinking in moderation (tekanyetso) is the key to reducing the risks associated with alcohol consumption.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho kopanya jwala le methanol:** This would *increase* the risks, not decrease them.
* **B: Ho nwa majwala a tswekere a seng molaong:** This would *increase* the risks significantly.
* **D: Ho nwa jwala le batho ba fapaneng:** This has no direct bearing on the health risks of alcohol consumption.



"
Ke dibaka dife toropng ya Amsterdam moo matlo a turang haholo?,"The correct answer is **A: Seterekeng sa Canal**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Canal District (Grachtengordel) is a famous area in Amsterdam's historic Binnenstad (city center). It then goes on to describe the canal district's UNESCO World Heritage status and high property values.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sebakeng sefe kapa sefe se kgethilweng e le sa nalane boemong ba lefatshe sa mokgatlo wa lefatshe wa thuto, mahlale, botjhaba le dikhokahanyo (UNESCO):** While the Canal District *is* a UNESCO World Heritage site, this option is too broad. It describes the *status* of the Canal District, not the location of densely populated residential areas.
* **C: Dibakeng tse tlositsweng sebakeng sa Binnenstad:** This is too vague. While residential areas are *within* the Binnenstad, it doesn't specify *where* in the Binnenstad.
* **D: Dibakeng tse nang le boleng ba nalane:** This is also too general.  Many places in Amsterdam have historical significance.  The passage focuses specifically on the Canal District.



"
"Hobaneng Setereke sa Canal se kgethilwe e le Sebaka sa Nalane Boemong ba Lefatshe sa Mokgatlo wa Lefatshe wa Thuto, Mahlale, Botjhaba le Dikgokahanyo?","The correct answer is **A: Ke sebaka sa boleng sa nalane le botjhaba (It is a place of outstanding cultural and historical value)**.

The passage explicitly states that the Canal District was chosen as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ""for its outstanding universal value of **cultural and historical** significance."" While options B and D touch on aspects of the district, option A encompasses the core reason for its designation. Option C is too general."
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse lateng, ke ntho efe e etsang hore ho tjhakela Phnom Krom ho be le boleng?","The correct answer is **A: Tjhebahalo e ntle e hodima letsha la Tonle Sap**.

The text states: ""Tikoloho e sa hlakang ya tempele le ho shebahala ha letsha la Tonle Sap ho etsa ho palamela leralleng ho tshwanelehe."" This translates to: ""The unfavorable environment of the temple and the appearance of the Tonle Sap lake cause the land to be prone to flooding.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, keng se hlokuwang ho baeti hore ba kene thoteng ya Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **D: Ho palama seketswana ho potoloha letsha la Tonle Sap.**

The text states: ""Tsela ya ho Feta ya Angkor ya hlokeha hore o kene tempeleng kahoo o seke wa lebala ho tla le phasepoto ya hao ha o ya Tonle Sap."" This translates to ""The way to visit Angkor requires you to enter the temple, so don't forget to bring your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.""  The connection is that getting to Phnom Krom involves a boat trip on Tonle Sap Lake, and a passport is required for that.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ka thibelang bahahlaodi ho tjhakela sebakeng sa Antarctica?","The correct answer is **C: Lethathamo la mosebetsi le dumellang moeti ho tsamaya ka Tshitwe le ka Pherekgong.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Antarctic travel is dangerous and requires experienced people. It also mentions that the travel is often done by plane between certain locations. The passage implies that a significant workload, allowing for travel by plane (Tshitwe le ka Pherekgong - likely referring to aircraft), is a key factor in enabling travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ditekanyetse tsa ditjhelete tse phahameng bakeng sa leeto (High travel costs):** While likely a factor, the passage doesn't specifically highlight cost as the *main* impediment. It focuses on the dangers and the need for experienced people.
*   **B: Ho kgahlwa feela ke ho ya lewatleng la Ross (Only being allowed to go to the Ross Sea):** This is too restrictive. The passage describes travel between multiple locations.
*   **D: Ho sitwa ho tsamaya (Being delayed in travel):** This describes a problem *during* travel, not a reason to *prevent* travel altogether.

Therefore, the workload that enables plane travel is the most likely factor preventing travel to Antarctica.
"
Mohahlaudi ya nang le kgahleho ho dipapadi tsa dithabeng a ka tjhakela karolo efe ya Antarctica?,"The correct answer is **B: Dibaka tse hole le lebopo la lewatle**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maeto a bahahlaudi a tura haholo, a hloka motho ya shahlileng, mme a ba nakong ya lehlabula feela ho tloha kgweding ya Pudungwana ho ya ho Hlakola, mme hangata a fella Hlwahlweng, Dihlekehlekeng le Lewatleng la Ross."" 

It further mentions: ""Ka dinako tse ding bahahlaudi ba etsang mesebetsi e itseng ba leba kahara naha ka sefofane, ba hlwa dithaba kapa ba leba Ntlheng, moo ho nang le kampo e kgolo.""

Since the question asks about a mountaineer participating in expeditions, and mountaineering involves climbing mountains, the most logical location would be ""Dibaka tse hole le lebopo la lewatle"" (Places away from the coast), where mountains are found and large camps exist. The other options are specific locations mentioned but don't encompass the general area where mountaineering happens.



"
Sebaka sa khale sa ho boha se ka fumaneha kae moo ho seng bobebe hore se fumanehe?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebakeng se hole le toropo (A place away from the city)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that historical sites are often found in places away from cities or educational institutions, making them more accessible. 
* Option C directly reflects this information.
* Options A and B are incorrect because the passage emphasizes sites *away* from urban areas.
* Option D is too specific; while some historical sites might be in schools, the passage doesn't suggest that's the *primary* location.



"
Khamera ya telescope ya dipatlisiso e ka behwa sebakeng sefe?,"The best answer is **D: Sebakeng se seholo (A large site)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that modern research facilities are often located in remote, environmentally suitable areas. A telescope camera needs a large, unobstructed view of the sky, so it requires a large, open space.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Sebaka sa poloko ya lintho tsa khale (An archaeological site):** While research happens at archaeological sites, the passage doesn't connect this to telescope locations. Also, archaeological sites might not always have ideal viewing conditions.
*   **B: Kahara Junifesithi (University campus):** University campuses can be crowded and may not have the necessary open space or minimal light pollution.
*   **C: Sebakeng ba boithuto (Educational institution):** Similar to university campuses, educational institutions are unlikely to be remote enough or have the optimal conditions for a telescope.

Therefore, a large, remote site is the most logical location for a telescope camera."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe se khutsitseng hantle ho ka etela lebopo letshehare lohle?","The correct answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states that Mission Bay is part of the Waitemata Harbour and is known for being a popular spot for families and having many shops, and being a safe place to visit.
* While St Heliers is also mentioned as being part of the Waitemata Harbour and a good spot, Mission Bay is highlighted more strongly as a place that attracts families and has a lot to offer, implying a more bustling and likely enjoyable experience for a whole day.
* The other options are too broad: ""Setereke sa North Harbor"" is a region, not a specific location; and ""Waitemata Harbor"" is the harbour itself.

Therefore, Mission Bay is the best fit for a place to visit a bay and spend the whole day according to the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe se bolokehileng ka ho fitisisa bakeng sa ho sesa?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""Mabopo a Kou e ka Leboya... e ka borwa ho ya Devonport e ka borwa."" (The beaches of North Harbour... can be travelled north to Devonport.)
* It also says: ""Ho ekabang kaofela ha wona ke mabopo a tletseng lehlabathe moo motho a ka sesang a sireletsehile..."" (All of them are beaches full of sand where a person can feel safe...)
* Devonport is explicitly mentioned as a safe place to swim.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Setereke sa North Harbor:** This is too broad. The text specifies Devonport as a safe beach within the North Harbour.
* **C: Central Auckland:** The text mentions beaches in Central Auckland (Mission Bay and St Heliers), but doesn't specifically highlight them as *the* safest.
* **D: Long Bay:** The text says you can travel *from* Long Bay *to* Devonport, implying Devonport is the destination for a safe swim, not Long Bay itself.



"
"Ha o etetse sebaka se hlalositsweng seratswaneng, ke ntho efe ho tse latelang e nkuwang e le ho se hlomphe?","The correct answer is **C: Ho etsa metlae**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly states:** ""O se ke wa etsa metlae ka Holocaust kapa Manazi."" (Do not make graffiti about the Holocaust or Nazis).  Making graffiti is a direct violation of the respectful treatment the location deserves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho itshwara ka tsela e hlomphehang (To behave respectfully):** This is exactly what the prompt *asks* of you.
* **B: Ho siya letshwoa kae-kae setsheng seo (Leaving trash around the place):**  While disrespectful, it's not as severe as making graffiti related to the Holocaust.
* **D: Ho ngwapa seterakatjhara (Spitting on the ground):** This is disrespectful but again, not on the same level as Holocaust-related graffiti.

Therefore, making graffiti (especially about the Holocaust or Nazis) is the most egregious act of disrespect among the choices.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke lintho dife tse hlalosang dipuo tsa fanakalo?","The correct answer is **B: E sa tlwaelehang (Unusual)**.

Here's why:

The question describes ""dipuo tsa fanakalo"" (language of reconciliation) as distinct from everyday languages. It specifically mentions that these languages are *not* like natural or standard languages. Therefore, ""e sa tlwaelehang"" (unusual) best captures this difference.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ya maiketsetso (Formal):** While language of reconciliation might be somewhat structured, formality isn't the primary defining characteristic.
*   **C: E hlophisitsweng (Structured):**  While there's structure, the emphasis is on being *different* from standard structure.
*   **D: E sa hlapholwang (Unconstrained/Uncontrolled):** While perhaps a component, ""unconstrained"" doesn't fully capture the nuanced meaning of a language specifically designed for reconciliation and overcoming past conflicts.

Therefore, **""E sa tlwaelehang"" (Unusual)** is the most accurate descriptor."
Ke polelo efe e sa haloseng ka nepo dipuo tseo eseng tsa mathomo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ke dipuo tsa mathomo le tse iketseditseng**.

Here's why:

The question asks which option doesn't fit the description of ""non-native or planned languages"" designed to facilitate communication between people who have difficulty communicating.  Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ke dipou tse sa hlaphollwang tse sebediswang ho fetisa molaetsa dipakeng tsa batho ba buang dipuo tse fapaneng** (Unspoken languages used to convey messages between people speaking different languages) - This *could* fit.  Sign languages, for example, are a form of unspoken language.

*   **B: Ke dipuo tsa mathomo le tse iketseditseng** (Native and independent languages) - This is the **opposite** of what the question is describing. ""Native"" languages are the languages people grow up speaking, and ""independent"" doesn't align with the idea of a language created *specifically* for cross-cultural communication.

*   **C: Ke dipuo tse etseditsweng ho matlafatsa puisano boemong boo batho ba sa utlwisisaneng** (Languages created to improve communication in situations where people do not understand each other) - This *perfectly* fits the description. This is precisely what planned languages are for.

*   **D: Dipuo tse iketseditsweng tse ka sehloohong lipakeng tsa batho ba buang dipuo tse fapaneng** (Independent languages primarily between people speaking different languages) - This *could* fit. Esperanto, for example, is an independent planned language used for communication between people of different native languages.

Therefore, **B** is the only option that doesn't describe a planned or non-native language designed for communication between people with language barriers.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng seo bapalami ba lokelang ho se ela hloko haeba leeto la bona la sekepe le ha ho le mariha?","The correct answer is **A: Sebaka sa ho beha thepa sekepeng (Luggage placement on the ship)**.

Here's why:

The text mentions checking the luggage storage area for potential issues like damage from movement during the journey.  The question asks what passengers should be mindful of if their sea voyage is not smooth. Therefore, luggage placement and security are the most relevant concern.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dipehelo tsa ho fumana visa (Visa requirements):** The text explicitly states there are no visa requirements for passengers on Saint Petersburg cruise ships (subject to verification).
*   **C: Dipehelo (Regulations):** While regulations are always important, the text focuses on a specific issue related to the voyage's smoothness, not general regulations.
*   **D: Nako eo a e qetang toropong (Time spent in the city):** The text mentions the duration of the trip in Saint Petersburg but does not highlight it as a primary concern if the journey is not smooth.

Therefore, luggage placement and the possibility of damage to belongings is the most directly relevant concern.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, haeba leeto la sekepe la mopalami le ka ba hlabula, ke sefe seo a ka nnang a se qoba?","The correct answer is **A: Nako toropong**.

Here's why:

The question asks what a traveler might lose if their ship is delayed according to the text. The text states: ""Dikepe tsa bahahlaudi tsa Saint Petersburg di akarelletsa nako toropong."" This translates to ""Saint Petersburg cruise ships include time in the city.""  Therefore, a delay would result in lost time in the city.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho feta hara maqhwa (Passing through the fairway):** The text mentions checking for debris in the ship's hull, but it doesn't connect a delay to passing through a fairway.
* **C: Dipehelo tsa ho fumana visa (Visa requirements):** The text explicitly states there are no visa requirements for cruise ship passengers (subject to verification).  A delay wouldn't suddenly introduce visa issues.
* **D: Saint Petersberg:** While the text mentions Saint Petersburg, it's the location, not a potential loss due to a delay.



"
Hobaneng puo ya Catalan e sebeliswa khafetsa matshwaong le ho etsa ditsebiso toropong ya Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ke puo ya pele ya se-molao toropong eo**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""matshwao a mangata a bontshwa feela ka Secatalan hobane se hlomamisitswe ka molao e le puo ya pele ya molao."" (many signs are displayed only in Catalan because it is legally recognized as the official language).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E utlwisiseha ho feta puo ya Spanish** (It is understood more than Spanish) - The text says half the population understands Catalan, but *everyone* knows Spanish. Therefore, it's not understood *more*.
* **C: Ke puo e thahasellwang toropong ya Barcelona** (It is an interesting language in the city of Barcelona) - The text doesn't mention anything about Catalan being interesting; it focuses on its legal status.
* **D: Sebaka sa diterene tse tsamayang tlasa lefatshe le dibaka tse ding tse etelwang khafetsa ke batho ba buang puo ya Calatan** (Underground train stations and other frequently visited places are used by people who speak Catalan) - While the text *does* mention that train station announcements are only in Catalan, it doesn't state that underground stations are *frequently* visited by Catalan speakers. Also, the question is about where it's used *most often*, not *by whom*.



"
Ke puo efe ho tse latelang e sebeliswang ho etsa ditsebiso ke setsi sa toropo ya Barcelona sa diterene tse tsamayang ka tlasa lefatshe?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ditsebiso tsa kamehla Seteisheneng sa Terene di etswa feela ka Secatalan..."" which translates to ""Regular announcements at the Metro Station are made only in Catalan...""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe ya dintho tse khahlisang eo ho seng bobebe ho hlwauwa ele ya bohlokwa ke matlo a bodulo a maemo a phahameng?","The correct answer is **B: Thepa ya ka tlung ya mehleng ya khale, e ikhethang (Unique antique home furnishings)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ho boemong bo hodimo, di-B&B ka ho hlakileng di hlodisana ka dintho tse pedi tse ka sehlohoong: marobalo le dijo tsa hoseng. ... Hlophiso e ka ba moaho wa kgale wa histori o nang le thepa ya boholo-holo, dirapa tse kgabisitsweng le letamo la ho sesa."" This translates to: ""In higher-end accommodations, B&Bs clearly focus on two main things: furnishings and breakfast. ... The decor can be an old historical building with unique antique furnishings, well-equipped kitchens, and a dining room.""

The other options are not mentioned or emphasized in the text as key characteristics of luxury B&Bs.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe eseng ya tse ding tsa dintlha tsa bohlokwa ho qothisaneng lehlokwa hwa matlo a boroko a maemo a hodimo?","The correct answer is **D: Dijo le terinki tse fumanehang haufinyane** (Food and toiletries readily available).

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes that luxury B&Bs focus on **bedding and breakfast**.  It mentions luxurious bedding (silk sheets, large beds) and breakfast that includes local specialties or custom meals.
* Options A, B, and C all relate directly to creating a luxurious experience:
    * **A: Mekgabiso ya mmala e kopaneng** (Coordinated color scheme) contributes to the aesthetic and luxury.
    * **B: Khetho ya dijo tsa hoseng e fapaneng ho latela dinako tsa selemo** (Variety of breakfast choices depending on the season) adds to the personalized and luxurious experience.
    * **C: Dikobo le masela a bethe tsa boemo bo hodimo** (High-end bed linens) is directly mentioned as a key element of luxury bedding.
* Option D, **Dijo le terinki tse fumanehang haufinyane** (Food and toiletries readily available), while useful, is not specifically highlighted as a core element of what defines a luxury *B&B* experience in the provided text. The text focuses more on the *quality* and *selection* of food and the luxurious nature of the *bedding*.



Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the passage's emphasis is D.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa tlo tshwarelwa toropong ya Beijing ka 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Dipapadi tsa ho theledisa lehlweng sebakeng sa Taizicheng**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dipapadi tse ding tse ding tsa ho thellisa leqhweng di tla ba sebakeng sa ho thellisa leqhweng sa Taizicheng e ileng Zhangjiakou, ho e ka bang 220 km (di-mile tse 140) ho tloha Beijing.""  This means the events held in the Taizicheng venue (near Zhangjiakou) *won't* be held in Beijing.

The other options *are* mentioned as being held in Beijing:

*   **A: Mokete o bulang lipapadi** (Opening Ceremony) is explicitly stated to be in Beijing.
*   **C: Mokete o kwalang dipapadi** (Closing Ceremony) is explicitly stated to be in Beijing.
*   **D: Dipapadi tsa leqhweng tsa ka tlung** (Indoor Winter Sports Events) are explicitly stated to be held in Beijing.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke dintho dife tse tla tshwarelwa Beijing ka selemo sa 2022?","The correct answer is **D: Mekete e kwalang dipapadi**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Beijing e tla tshwara mokete wa ho bula le ho kwala le dipapadi tse bapallwang leqhweng tsa ka hare."" (Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the indoor competitions.)

While Beijing will host both the Winter Olympics and the closing ceremony, option D ""Mekete e kwalang dipapadi"" (Closing ceremonies) is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided text.  It encompasses both the opening *and* closing ceremonies, which are key elements mentioned.
"
Ke batho bafe ba tlokotsing e kgolo ya ho fumana tshwaetso ya lefuba la avian?,"The correct answer is **C: Basebetsi ba dikhohong (Poultry workers)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ke ngata di akarelletsa batho ba sebetsang ka dikgoho..."" which translates to ""It often includes people who work with poultry...""

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Batho ba ratang ho boha dinonyana (People who raise birds)** - While bird raisers are at risk, the passage specifically mentions those working *with* poultry in general.
*   **B: Batho ba sebetsang le diphoofolo tse nyantshang (People who work with livestock)** - The passage focuses specifically on *dinonyana* (birds), not general livestock.
*   **D: Batho ba ileng ba tshwaetswa pele (People who have been infected before)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke dipolelo dife tse hlalosang ka nepo lefuba la dinonyana?","The correct answer is **B: Dipalo tse ngata di fumanwe ho batho ho feta ho dinonyana**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Dipeho tse tlaase ho tse dikete di kile tsa behwa ka batho... Tse ngata di akarelletsa batho ba sebetsang ka dikgoho..."" This indicates that human cases, while not as common as in birds, *do* occur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ke basebetsi feela ba dikhohong ba tshwerweng ke lefuba:** The text mentions people working with poultry but also explicitly says there's a risk to poultry workers (which includes those who might not be directly employed by a government).
* **C: Batho ba ratang ho boha dinonyana ba tlokotsing ya ho tshwaetswa:** The text doesn't mention people who *try* to infect birds with the flu. It discusses accidental exposure.
* **D: Dipalo tsohle tsa batho ba tshwaeditsweng ke tsa batho ba hlokahetseng:** The text states that the cases often involve poultry workers, but doesn't claim all infected people are ""vulnerable"" in some way.



"
Sekepe sa White sea-Baltic se kopanya eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Lewatle la Artic le Noka ya Baltic**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lewatle le Lesweu–Baltic Canal e hokahanya Lewatle la Arctic le Lewatle la Baltic...""  This translates to ""The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea...""

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the connection made by the White Sea-Baltic Canal.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuteng ofe wa koloi moo diphasepoto di ka nkuwang e le ho qoba ho kena-kenana le bapalami?","The correct answer is **C: Dikepe**.

The text states: ""Sebaka sa ho hlola diphasepotso tsa bafalli ka ho tlwaelehileng ke sebaka sa ho qala seo o yang ho sona ha o theoha sefofaneng, sekepeng kapa sepalanngwang se seng.""  This translates to: ""The usual place to check passports is where you first arrive, whether you arrive by plane, ship, or other means.""

While the text mentions planes, ships, and ""other means,"" it specifically includes ""sekepeng"" which means ""ship"" or ""ferry.""  The question asks about vehicles where passports are checked to board.  Among the options, a **ship (dikepe)** is the most accurate fit.  The other options are not specifically mentioned in the text as places where passport checks are routinely performed *before* boarding.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, tokomana ya hao ya boitsebiso eka nna ya batluwa neng ditereneng tse yang kantle ho naha?","The correct answer is **A: Kamora ho theoha tereneng**.

The passage states: ""Sebaka sa ho hlola diphasepotso tsa bafalli ka ho tlwaelehileng ke sebaka sa ho qala seo o yang ho sona ha o theoha sefofaneng, sekepeng kapa sepalanngwang se seng."" This translates to: ""The usual place to check passports is the place you arrive at, whether it's an airplane, a ship, or other transport.""

Therefore, your passport is checked **after** you arrive at the location.

"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ka nnang ya o etsahalla ha o dula dibakeng tse pela bohare ba lefatshe naheng ya Singapore?","The correct answer is **C: Ho hlolwa ke motjheso (Being exposed to the sun)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Singapore is near the equator and experiences both constant humidity and intense sun, especially when the sky is clear. Option C directly reflects this: being exposed to the sun.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho khothotswa (Being flooded):** The passage mentions humidity, not flooding.
*   **B: Ho se fumane mokgwa wa ho ya dishopong (Not being able to go to shops):** The passage says it's easy to go shopping.
*   **D: Ho lahleha (Getting lost):** While getting lost is *possible* anywhere, it's not specifically mentioned as a consequence of staying in Singapore.
"
Ke mang ya ka nnang a batla ho qoba ho ja di-pastry tsa Majeremane?,"The correct answer is **A: Motho ya hlolwang ke dijo tsa dinatse haholo** (Someone who is very wary of sweets).

Here's why:

* The text describes German pastries as being very rich and sweet (""monate haholo,"" ""enne haholo"").
* The description emphasizes ingredients like almonds, walnuts, and cream.
* It even mentions that they are often enjoyed with strong coffee.

Therefore, someone who avoids sweets would likely not enjoy German pastries. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Motho ya ratang mafatshe-thotomela a boemo bo hodimo** (Someone who likes high-end gourmet food): While some German pastries could be considered gourmet, the description doesn't specifically target this preference.
* **C: Motho ya sa rateng ditjhokolete** (Someone who doesn't like chocolate): While some pastries *might* have chocolate, the text doesn't focus on chocolate as a primary characteristic.
* **D: Motho ya ratang dijo tse tswekere ho feta tse letswai** (Someone who likes crunchy foods more than soft foods): The text describes pastries as soft and creamy, not crunchy.



"
Ke eng eo molemo wa yona e leng ho natefisa di-pastry tsa Majeremane?,"The correct answer is **A: Diapole (Apples)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Diphae tsa ditholwana di tlwaelehile, ka di apole tse phehilweng tse kengwang diphaeng selemo kaofela..."" which translates to ""The most common pastries are baked apples, which are prepared in the dough all year round...""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ke keng ya ba keletso ho batho ba yang leetong ka tjhelete e lekaneng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho kopa batho tjhelete (To beg people for money)**.

The text explicitly states that the advice **does not** include things like ""ho kope"" (begging). The passage outlines ethical ways to travel cheaply, emphasizing not engaging in illegal activities or exploiting others. Begging falls squarely into the category of unethical and unacceptable behavior according to the described ""moralo wa tjhelete e nyenyane"" (ethical money plan).

Let's look at why the other options are *not* explicitly excluded:

* **A: Ho fumana mesebetsi ya nakwana ya katlung ha o le leetong (Finding seasonal jobs while traveling):**  This is a common and acceptable way to reduce costs while traveling.
* **B: Ho dula o butse kelello le ha o natefetswe (Staying open-minded and being content):**  This is a positive attitude that aids in budget travel.
* **D: Ho fokotsa ditjeo tse kang dijo le boroko (Reducing expenses like food and accommodation):** This is the core of the ""money plan"" and a key way to travel cheaply.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang a ka bang le mathata ha ya leetong ka tjhelete e nyane?","The correct answer is **A: Motho ya amohelang phepetso (Someone who accepts the challenge)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the travel plan is for those ""bakeng sa bao ba ikemiseditseng ho lahlehelwa ke mabotho-botho, nako le ponelo-pele ya hore o sututse ditshenyehelo di fihle ho noto..."" which translates to ""for those who are prepared to sacrifice time, money and personal comfort to make expenses reach their lowest point...""  This implies that someone willing to take on this challenge would be the one who could potentially face difficulties on a budget.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Motho ya se nang mathata ka taba ya nako (Someone who doesn't have problems with time):** The text mentions sacrificing time, so this isn't applicable.
* **C: Motho ya rerang ho sebeletsa ka thoko ho kantoro ya mosebetsi ha le leetong (Someone who plans to work full-time while traveling):**  The text focuses on minimizing expenses, not generating income.
* **D: Motho ya natefelwang ke ho latela melao ya ditaba tsa leeto la hae (Someone who is committed to following the laws of their travel destination):**  The text *specifically excludes* illegal activities like entering unauthorized areas or engaging in illicit markets. Therefore, commitment to laws is a positive attribute, not a source of difficulty.



"
"Hara dipolelo tse latelang, ke polelo efe e sa hlaloseng ka nepo tsela e dipakeng tsa Point Marion le Fairmont?","The correct answer is **C: Bakhanni ha ba ikobele taolo ya lebelo la molao (Drivers do not always adhere to speed limits)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sebaka se bohareng ba Point Marion le Fairmount se baka maemo a thata haholo a ho kganna Mmileng o Moholo wa Buffalo-Pittsburgh...Meedi ya lebelo e ngotsweng e fatshe ka tsela e kgethehileng ho feta dikarolong tse fetileng le tse latelang — ka ho tlwaelehileng 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — mme ho di mamela hohle-hohle ho bohlokwa haholo ho feta ho se etse jwalo.""  This highlights a problem with drivers *not* adhering to the speed limit.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **A: Ho na le ditsela tse telele tse maluting ka thoko ho toropo (There are long winding roads in the town):** The passage mentions winding roads as a contributing factor to difficult driving conditions.
* **B: Ditsela di mopatisane (The roads are narrow):** The passage mentions narrow roads as a contributing factor to difficult driving conditions.
* **D: Ditshebeletso tsa mehala ya thekeng ha di a lokela ho ba bothata (Road maintenance services are not likely to be problematic):** The passage actually notes that cell service is strong in this area, which is a positive, *not* a problem with road maintenance.

Therefore, the statement that drivers do *not* always adhere to speed limits is the one that is *not* accurately described by the passage.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e lokelang ho ba ngongoreho e kholo ho bakhanni ba sebedisang tsela e kholo ya Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **A: Ho kwallwa ke sephethephethe se sengata** (Heavy Traffic).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Point Marion and Fairmount sections of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh corridor have ""very difficult conditions for recreational canoeing"" due to ""numerous rapids, narrow passages, and numerous waterfalls."" While the passage mentions cell service being strong, it also emphasizes the importance of listening for traffic noise, implying it's a significant factor. However, the primary difficulty mentioned is the rapids and waterfalls, which naturally lead to heavy traffic as people navigate those challenging sections. The other options aren't directly supported by the passage's emphasis on the canoeing experience.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho se fumane tshebediso e lekaneng ya ditshebeletso tsa mara-ngrang** (Lack of adequate internet service): The passage states cell service is strong, the opposite of this option.
*   **C: Ho tjeka huku ya tsela e kotsi ka sekgahla** (Checking for dangerous road noise): The passage mentions listening for traffic noise, not checking for dangerous road noise.
*   **D: Ho kopano le dibaka tse ngata tsa moo tsela e lokiswang** (Encountering many well-maintained roads): The passage describes the *opposite* - difficult, poorly maintained sections with rapids and waterfalls.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa hlokahaleng hore motho a ka qala ho sesa ka seketswana?","The correct answer is **B: Boemo ba dilemo tseo motho a bang le matla haholo ho tsona** (Physical fitness for the canyons).

Here's why:

The text states that canyoning requires ""kwetliso e nyenyane kapa ho itekanela mmeleng hore o qadise"" (moderate fitness or physical ability to cope). It explicitly *doesn't* say you need to be exceptionally fit. While physical fitness is helpful, it's not a primary requirement for *starting* to canyon.

The other options are all relevant:

*   **A: Bokhoni ba ho sesa** (Rappelling ability) - Canyoning involves rappelling.
*   **C: Bokhoni ba ho qhoma** (Swimming ability) - Canyoning often involves swimming.
*   **D: Kwetliso e fokolang** (Minimal training) - The text specifically mentions minimal training is needed.



Therefore, being exceptionally physically fit for canyons is *not* a necessary prerequisite to beginning canyoning."
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ka hlokahalang ho etsa hore leeto la ho sesa ka seketswana e be le atlehileng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho tiiswa ka molao ditabeng tsa ho sesa ka seketswana (Having legal authorization for canyoning)**.

Here's why:

* **Safety First:** Canyoning can be dangerous.  Having the proper authorization often involves certification and understanding of local regulations, hazards, and rescue procedures.  This is crucial for a successful and safe trip.
* **Other Options are relevant but secondary:**
    * **A: Boiphehlelo bo hodimo mmeleng ho tsa dipapadi (Advanced upper body fitness):** While helpful, physical fitness is important but not the *primary* requirement for a *successful* trip.  It's more about preparedness.
    * **B: Boiphelo ditabeng tsa ho qwela ka metsing (Experience in water-based activities):**  Some experience with water activities is beneficial, but canyoning involves specific techniques and risks unique to canyons.
    * **D: Ho tseba ho sesa (Knowing how to rappel):** Rappelling is *part* of canyoning, but knowing how to rappel alone doesn't guarantee a safe or successful canyoning trip.  It requires a broader understanding of canyoning techniques and safety protocols.

Therefore, the most fundamental requirement for a successful and safe canyoning trip is ensuring you have the legal authorization and understand the regulations.  This is often tied to having the necessary skills and training.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe e ka bang bohlokwa ho motho ya rerang ho khempa ka koloing ya hae?","The correct answer is **A: Kutlwisiso e matla tabeng ya hore na koloi ya hao e ka se etse eng le eng.**

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Ho kampa koloing ho ka etsahala haeba o na le vene, SUV, Sedan kapa Station Wagon se se nang le ditulo tse kgonang ho robala.""  This means the *capability* of the car to fold/recline seats is essential. Knowing what your car *can* do is the foundational understanding for successful car camping.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly the *most* important according to the passage:

*   **B: Koloi e dumellang ditulo hore di sekame:** While important, this is a *consequence* of the ability to camp. You need to know your car *can* fold down before you consider if it *does*.
*   **C: Tente:** The passage doesn't mention tents as being inherently important to car camping. It's implied that you might *use* a tent.
*   **D: Sebaka sa monga sona seo motho a ka khempang ho sona:** Location is important for *where* you camp, but understanding your car's capabilities is the first step to *if* you can camp at all.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, bo-ramakoloi ba khempang ba ka batla ho qoba eng haeba ba batla ho dula tlasa reidara?","The correct answer is **A: Ho khanna koloi e kholo jwalo ka mofuta wa SUV kapa fene e nyane**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Ho kampa koloing ho ka etsahala haeba o na le vene, SUV, Sedan kapa Station Wagon se se nang le ditulo tse kgonang ho robala."" (Camping in a car can happen if you have a van, SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon with foldable seats).  The question asks what type of car a camper might want to use. Option A directly reflects this information.

The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **B: Ho nka leeto le lelelele** (Taking a long trip): While camping often involves travel, the text doesn't specifically link long trips to wanting to camp *in* a car.
*   **C: Ho hloma tente hara toropo kapa setsheng sa monga sona** (Setting up a tent in a town or campground): This describes a different way to camp, not camping *in* a car.
*   **D: Ho se tsebe ka koloi eo ba e sebedisang** (Not knowing the car they are using):  Knowing your car is important, but the text isn't about lack of knowledge, it's about having the right type of car for camping.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya ahileng botjha toropo ya Casablanca lekgetlo la bobedi?","The correct answer is **D: Morena wa naha ya Morocco**.

The text states: ""Mmusi wa Morocco o hahile botjha toropo e le Daru I-Badya..."" which translates to ""The ruler of Morocco rebuilt the town as Daru I-Badya...""
"
Ke mang ya lahlileng toropo ya moraorao ya Casablanca kamora koduwa ya tlholeho?,"The correct answer is **B: Mapotoketsi (Phoenicians)**.

The passage states: ""Mapotoketsi a e thubile mme ba e haha hape ka tlase ha lebitso la Casa Branca..."" This translates to ""The Phoenicians rebuilt it and also built it below the name Casa Branca...""

Therefore, the Phoenicians were the ones who rebuilt the city after the earthquake.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, toropo ya Sintra e ile ya tuma jwang ho baditjhaba?","The correct answer is **C: Maikutlwo a matle ka yona a Lord Byron**.

The text explicitly states: ""e tume ho batho ba dinaha tse ding ka moraho ha tlaleho entle haholo ya bokgabane ba yona e tlalehilweng ke Lord Byron.""  This translates to ""it became famous among people from other countries after the very good reputation of its beauty was attributed to Lord Byron.""
"
Ke eng e sa amohelweng ke naha ya Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Rephaboliki e ntjha**.

The passage states: ""Le ha ho le jwalo, ha ho na naha e thehilweng - esita le Armenia - e e amohelang ka se mmuso."" This means Armenia doesn't recognize the newly formed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.
"
Keng eng e tswelang pele ho thunthetsa dikamano dipakeng tsa Azerbaijan le Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Sebaka sa Nagorno-Karabakh**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka 1994, sebaka sa morabe sa Armenia sa Nagorno-Karabakh se ile sa lwana le Azerbaijan."" (In 1994, the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Armenia clashed with Azerbaijan.) This conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region is the primary reason for the breakdown in relations between the two countries.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batho ba Armenia ba dulang Azerbaijan** (Armenians fled Azerbaijan): While there was displacement of people, the core issue was the territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, not simply Armenian migration.
*   **B: Ntwa ya 1994** (The year 1994): While 1994 is the year the conflict escalated, it's the *event* (the clash over Nagorno-Karabakh) that caused the breakdown, not the year itself.
*   **C: Dingangisano tsa dipolomate** (Diplomatic negotiations): The passage indicates that diplomatic negotiations *failed*, contributing to the conflict, but they were not the cause of the initial breakdown.



"
"Ha o tsamaya ka tekesi ho ya Charlotte, ke eng e ka eketsang ditjeo?","The correct answer is **B: Ho ba le baeti ba bararo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ho na le tefo e eketsehileng ha ho na le bapalami ba fetang 2, eka kgetho ena e ka bitsa haholo ho sa hlokahale.""  This translates to: ""There is an added benefit when there are more than 2 passengers, making this option very convenient.""

This directly relates to the option of having three guests. The other options are not mentioned or supported by the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng ntho e nkuwang e se hantle ya ho dula sebakeng sa Charlotte le bana?","The correct answer is **B: Ho tsamaya ka tekesi (Taking taxis)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ditekisi ha di sebediswe hangata ke malapa ka Charlotte, le hoja di ka sebediswa maemong a itseng. Ho na le tefo e eketsehileng ha ho na le bapalami ba fetang 2, keona kgetho ena e ka bitsa haholo ho sa hlokahale.""  This translates to: ""Taxis are not often used by families in Charlotte, although they can be used in certain situations. There is an additional cost if there are more than 2 passengers, so this option is often not worth it.""

The text implies that taxis are *not* a good option for families in Charlotte. The other options are presented as positive aspects of living in Charlotte with children.



"
"Pele batho ba Spain ba fihla, ke mang a neng a laola karolo e leboya ya naha ya Chile?","The correct answer is **C: MaAraukania**.

The text states: ""Mamapuche e ne e le se seng sa dihlopha sa ho tswallwa moo tse ikemetseng tsa ho qetla tsa Amerika, tseo di neng di sa kena ka ho felletseng molaong wa ho bua Spanishe kamorao ha ho ikemela ha Chile."" This directly refers to the Mapuche people (also known as Araukania) being the governing group in the southern part of Chile before the arrival of the Spanish.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latenalg, ke ntho efe e sa etsahalang ka selemo sa 1810?","The correct answer is **A: Ho ne ho se na mmuso o moholo (There was no major government)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Le hoja Chile e patlaladitse ho Ikemela ka 1810..."". This means Chile declared independence in 1810.  The following sentence says ""...hare ha dintwa tsa Napoleon tse siileng Spain e se na mmuso o moholo dilemo tse mmalwa,"" which translates to ""...after the Napoleonic Wars had left Spain without a major government for several years.""

Therefore, while Chile declared independence in 1810, Spain didn't have a major government *at that time*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Chile e ile ya hlola batho ba Spain (Chile had fought the Spanish people):** The text says the major conflict *didn't* happen until 1818. It doesn't say there was fighting in 1810.
*   **C: Dintwa tsa Napoli di ne di lwanwa (The Napoleonic Wars were being fought):** The text states that the Napoleonic Wars had *already* occurred and resulted in Spain having no major government.
*   **D: Chile e ile ya phatlalatsa boipuso (Chile declared independence):** The text says Chile *did* declare independence in 1810.



"
Batho ba ka fihla jwang metseng e hole ya Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka terene kapa sekepe**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ditselana, diterene le dikepe di hokahanya metsana..."" This translates to ""Ferries, trains, and boats connect the villages...""
* It also says: ""...dikoloi ha di kgone ho fihla ho tsona di tswa ka ntle."" This translates to ""...cars cannot reach them from outside.""

Therefore, the primary ways to reach these villages are by train or boat.
"
Lentsoe lee ‘Cinque Terre’ la Setadiana le bolelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Metse e mehlano (Five towns)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Cinque Terre, e na le metsana e mehlano..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre has five towns...""
"
"Ho latela seratswana see, ke mofuta ofe wa dibutsu o loketseng ha ho rella?","The correct answer is **A: Dibutsu tse lirethe li motopo (Rounded nuts are suitable)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Paterone e lokela ho ba e tebileng ka ho lekaneng, 5 mm (1/5 inch) kapa ho feta, mme lesela e be bonolo ho lekananetseng ha ho bata. Dibutsi tse ding di na le dikonopo mme ho na le disebediswa tsa dikonopo tse eketswang bakeng sa maemo a thellang, tse loketseng dieta tse ngata le dibutsi, bakeng sa direthe le kapa direthe le bohato. **Lehlabathe, lehlohlojane kapa letswai (calcium chloride) hangata le hasana ditseleng kapa litselelaneng ho ntlafisa tshubuhlellano. Dibutsu tse lirethe li lokela ho ba tlase le bophara.**""

This means rounded nuts are the best choice for rolling because they are low and narrow.
"
Ho tse latelang ke eng e thusang hore ho se ke hwa thella tseleng nakong ya mariha?,"The correct answer is **C: Lehlabathe**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lehlabathe, lehlohlojane kapa letswai (calcium chloride) hangata le hasana ditseleng kapa litselelaneng ho ntlafisa tshubuhlellano."" (Lime, calcium chloride or salt are often sprinkled on the paths or tracks to improve hardening.)

While lehlohlojane (calcium chloride) and letswai (salt) are also mentioned as options, lehlabathe (lime) is listed first and is a common choice for this purpose.  Metsi (water) would *not* help prevent the tracks from becoming soft.
"
Ke efe tshwano e nepahetseng dipakeng tsa Hawaii le Dihlekehleke tsa Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Di nakong e le nngwe (at one time)**.

The text states: ""Ka nako ya sebaka e tswhanang le ya Hawaii, dihlekehleke ka nako e nngwe di nkuwa jwaloka “Hawaii ka tlaase”."" This means that at one point in time, the Cook Islands were considered similar to Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bobedi di na le dihotele tse kgolo tse ngata** - The text explicitly says the Cook Islands *do not* have large resorts.
*   **B: Bobedi ha di na boemo** - The text doesn't mention anything about the geographical location of Hawaii.
*   **D: Bobedi ha di na ditoropo** - The text states the Cook Islands are made up of 15 separate islands, with Rarotonga and Aitutaki being the main ones."
Ke eng e sa hlaloseng ka ho nepahala Dihlekehleke tsa Cook moo?,"The correct answer is **A: Di nyane ho Hawaii**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Like Hawaii, at one time the islands were described as “Hawaii en petite” (Hawaii in miniature)."" This directly means they are *smaller* than Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **B: Ke dihlopha tsa dihlekehleke (It is an archipelago):**  The text explicitly states this: ""Dihlekehleke tsa Cook ke sehlopha sa dihlekehleke...""
* **C: Ditoropo tsa mantlha ke Rarotonga le Aitutaki (The main towns are Rarotonga and Aitutaki):** This is mentioned in the text.
* **D: Naha e sehlekehlekeng e sebedisa nako e tshwanang le ya Hawaii (A small nation that uses the same time as Hawaii):**  The text mentions the time similarity, but doesn't specifically say it's a *small nation*. While it's small, the focus of the question is on what's *not* clearly explained, and the size comparison to Hawaii is more directly addressed.



"
Ke dife diteishene tsa bolebedi tse fanang ka mefuta e mmedi ya bodulo?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sirena ke yona feela seteishene sa bahlokomedi ba serapa se fanang ka sebaka sa ho dula le dijo tse tjhesang hodimo ha dikampo."" (Sirena is the only ranger station that offers lodging and food above the campsites.)

The other options are listed as campsites *without* food services.
"
"Ho latela seratswana see, ke kae moo o ka bolokang tumello ya ho paka haeba o batla ho sebedisa tjhelete eseng mokitlane?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sirena ke yona feela seteishene sa bahlokomedi ba serapa se fanang ka sebaka sa ho dula le dijo tse tjhesang hodimo ha dikampo."" (Sirena is the only ranger station that provides lodging and meals above the camps.)

This means that if you want to use money other than cash for your permit, Sirena is the only place mentioned that offers both lodging and meals, allowing for alternative payment methods.  The other options are either only camps (La Leona, San Pedrillo, Los Patos) or a place to get permit information (Puerto Jiménez), or a place to prepare for the trek (CafeNet El Sol).
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa ho theledisa o etswang moepeng?","The correct answer is **C: Setaele sa Alpine**.

The text specifically mentions ""Ho bona sebaka ka ho thellisa lehlweng kapa ho hahlaula naha ka ho thellisa lehlweng. E amahanngwa le empa e seng ka ho tlwaelehileng ho akarelletsa setaele sa ho thellisa lehlweng sa alpine sa ho sheba sebaka kapa ho palama dithaba..."" This clearly indicates that Alpine climbing is a type of climbing mentioned in the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana see, ke eng e ka thusang ba theledisang dibakeng tse kotsi ho fihlela lebelo le hodimo?","The correct answer is **D: Ditsela tse hlophisitsweng tsa ho thelledisa lehlweng (Established ski slopes)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Maemong a matle o tla kgona ho tsamaya bohole bo bolelele ho ena le ho tsamaya ka maoto – empa ke ka sewelo haholo feela o ka fumanang lebelo la ho thellisa lehlweng dibakeng tse sa tlwaelehang ntle le mokotla o imelang ditseleng tse lokisitsweng.""  This translates to: ""In good conditions you can walk for a long distance and hike - but you can only get skiing on unusual terrain without an independent ski lift.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dieta tse thata (Difficult diets):**  The text doesn't mention diets.
* **B: Mokotla o boima o jarwang ka mahetleng (Heavy ski lift):** The text talks about ski lifts in general, not specifically heavy ones.
* **C: Maemong a matle (Good conditions):** Good conditions are *necessary* but not *sufficient*. The text implies that even in good conditions, you need established slopes to ski safely and at higher levels.



"
Baeti ba nang le ho tshoha ho dula le ba ditso tse ding ba kopana le mathata afe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho ikamahanya le ditlwaelo tsa sebaka se setjha (Adjusting to the customs of a new place)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the difficulty of returning home after a long absence, specifically mentioning that it takes time to readjust to old customs and habits.  This directly relates to adjusting to the customs of a new place. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:

*   **B: Hoba le mamello le kutlwisiso (Having empathy and understanding):** The passage states that *others* have empathy and understanding for returning travelers, not that travelers themselves struggle with it.
*   **C: Ho etela mose (Visiting the sea):** While visiting the sea is mentioned, it's not the core problem faced by returning travelers.
*   **D: Ho ikamahanya le ditwaelo tsa moo ba tswang (Adjusting to the customs of where they come from):** The passage focuses on adjusting to the customs of the *new* place they were in, not their original home.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tshoha ho dula le batho ba ditso tse ding ho ka baka bothata ho moeti ya jwang?","The correct answer is **A: Baeti ba kopanang le ditlwaelo tse mpe tse tshosang**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the difficulty returning home after a long absence, especially after adapting to a new environment (the ocean).  It highlights the need for understanding and patience from those at home. Option A directly addresses this by stating that guests can bring bad expectations that can cause problems for the returning person. The passage implies that those at home might have expectations about how quickly the returning person should readjust, which could be stressful and problematic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Baeti ba ileng ba tlwaela ho dula mose ho mawatle kapele:** The passage states the opposite - it's difficult to readjust quickly.
*   **C: Baeti ba qetang ho nyalana:** The passage doesn't mention anything about guests being prone to arguing.
*   **D: Baeti ba hlokang mamello:** While the passage *does* say returning people need patience, it focuses on the *returning person* needing it, not the *guests* needing it. The question asks about the problems for the *returning person* caused by guests.



"
Ke eng eo batho ba sa lokeleng ho e etsa ha ba kopana le phoofolo e bitswang moose?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho fokotsa kotsi eo ba ka nnang ba e baka.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that moose don't like to fight but will defend themselves.
* People might underestimate moose and approach them carelessly.
* Therefore, the best action to take is to reduce the risk of provoking a defensive reaction from the moose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho iphapanyetsa boteng ba yona:**  This isn't directly mentioned in the passage and might even escalate the situation.
* **B: Ho atamela butle-butle:** While being calm is good, it doesn't address the potential risk of provoking the moose.
* **D: Ho di shebela hole:** While maintaining a distance is important, the main focus should be on avoiding any action that could be perceived as threatening.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng eseng nnete ka phoofolo e bitswang moose?","The correct answer is **C: Di ka qalwa ke batho ba pela tsona haholo** (They can be easily tamed by people nearby).

Here's why:

* The passage states that moose don't *like* to be around people, but they will defend themselves if they feel threatened. This directly contradicts the idea that they can be easily tamed.
* The passage explicitly says they don't need antlers, but they'll defend themselves.
* The passage mentions that people might underestimate them, leading to danger.
* The passage confirms that they will defend themselves if they feel threatened.

Therefore, option C is the statement that is *not* true according to the passage.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka bang kotsi ho batsamai ba lehwatateng?","The correct answer is **B: Ho bona seriti se kang metsi empa e se ona.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ha ho tjhesa, batsamai ba ka bona ho phatsima ho kang metsi ho fanang ka kgopolo ya hore ke metsi (kapa dintho tse ding). Tsena di ka eba kotsi haeba motsamai a latella ho phatsima ho kang metsi, a senya matla ao e leng letlotlo le metsi a setseng.""  This directly points to mistaking water-like formations for actual water as a danger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho hloka diaparo tse mofuthu bosiu ha ho bata:** While lack of warm clothing is a risk, the passage emphasizes the danger of *mistaking formations for water* first.
* **C: Ho senya nako ba shebana le diriti:** The passage doesn't mention time or being exposed to the sun as a primary danger.
* **D: Ho senya metsi ba latelletse seriti:** The passage does mention following a water-like formation *can* be dangerous, but the core danger is mistaking it for real water in the first place.



"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang e le tshoso ho baeti ba lehwatata?,"The correct answer is **C: Bokudi bo bakwang ke bho hatsela nako e telele** (Sunburn caused by prolonged exposure to the sun).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on risks associated with cold weather and wet conditions.** It mentions hypothermia, falls on ice/slush, and the dangers of getting wet.
* **Sunburn is a risk associated with *hot* weather and exposure to the sun, not cold or wet weather.** Therefore, it's the exception among the risks discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are *not* the correct answer:

* **A: Kgaello ya metsi (Water ice):**  The passage explicitly mentions the risk of falling on water ice.
* **B: ho phatshima ho kang metsi (Ice/Slush):** The passage directly states that falling on ice/slush is a risk.
* **D: Ho tjheswa ke letsatsi (Sunburn):** As explained above, this is unrelated to the theme of the passage.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa batho o ileng wa angwa ke ho fihla ha bafuputsi?","The correct answer is **C: Mataíno**.

The text states: ""Ho ya ka Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias) pakeng tsa 1492 le 1498 batho ba Taíno ba ka bang 100,000 ba ile ba bolawa ke bahale ba Spanish."" This directly indicates that the Taíno people were among the first to be killed by the Spanish colonizers.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Batho ba Haiti:** While Haiti is in the Caribbean, the text focuses on the Taíno people specifically.
* **B: Batho ba Caribe:**  ""Caribe"" refers to a group of indigenous people, but the text specifically mentions the Taíno.
* **D: Batho ba Spain:** The Spanish *killed* the Taíno, they were not the ones who were killed *first*.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, setjhaba sa Caribe se ne se bua puo efe?","The correct answer is **D: Searawakan**.

The text states: ""Macaribe e ne e le batho ba puo ya Arawakan ba fihlileng nakong ya 10,000 BCE."" This translates to ""The Macaribe were people who spoke the Arawakan language who arrived around 10,000 BCE.""
"
Ke mang ya ka tlotlwang ka ho tumisa ho theledisa e le papadi ya boithabiso?,"The correct answer is **A: Sehlopha sa ho theledisa (Skiing club)**.

The text states: ""ka 1861 sehlopha sa ho qala sa ho thellisa lehlwa sa boithabiso se ile sa bulwa ke batho ba Norway e leng Australia"" which translates to ""In 1861, the first skiing club for recreation was founded by people from Norway who were also Australians.""  Therefore, the skiing club is credited with popularizing skiing as a recreational activity.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho theledisa ho elelletswe neng hore ke papadi?","The correct answer is **C: 1861**.

The text states: ""Ho thellisa lehlweng o theosa le maralla ke papadi e tlohang morao kwana lekgolong la bo17 la dilemo, **ma-1861 sehlopha sa ho thellisa lehlwa sa boithabiso se ile sa bulwa ke batho ba Norway e leng Australia**"". This directly indicates that skiing as a recreational activity began in 1861.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke efe ho tse latelang e amahangwang le sehlekehleke se seholo ka ho fetisisa botjhabela ho lebopo la Afrika?","The correct answer is **D: Dibaka tsa boikgathollo tsa boemo bo hodimo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Madagascar ke yona e kgolo ka ho kgetheha, mme ke kontinente ka boyona ha ho tla bophelong ba naheng. Bongata ba dihlekehleke tse nyenyane ke dinaha tse ikemetseng, kapa tse amahanngwang le Fora, mme tse tsejwang jwaloka dibaka tsa boikgathollo tse mabopong a lewatle tsa majabajaba.""  This directly identifies the island nations as ""dibaka tsa boikgathollo tsa boemo bo hodimo"" (high-latitude refuges/islands).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tshusumetso ya ya Europa (European influence):** While European influence is mentioned, it's a *process* that happened over time, not the defining characteristic of the *largest* island nation.
* **B: Tumelo ya Mamoseleme (Muslim faith):**  The passage mentions Islam spreading to some countries, but it's not specific to the largest island nation.
* **C: Diphoofolo tse hlaha (Fossils):**  The passage doesn't mention fossils.



"
Ke eng eo e seng tshobotsi ya dihlekehleke tse nyane ka Afrika Botjhabela? ,"The correct answer is **C: Seriti se setle sa diphoofolo tse hlaha**.

Here's why:

* The text mentions that the island nations of the Indian Ocean are known as luxury, high-altitude refuges and centres of tourism. It also mentions the influence of Europe and colonialism.
* However, the text does **not** mention a ""fine herd of mammals"" as a defining characteristic of these island nations. 
* The other options are mentioned in the text:
    * **A: Tsela e kopanyang naha ya Fora** (A route connecting European countries) - The text mentions the sea route from Europe to India.
    * **B: Dibaka tse ngata tsa boikgathollo tsa boemo bo hodimo** (Many high-altitude refuge places) - The text refers to them as luxury, high-altitude refuges.
    * **D: Boipuso ho tloha ho ditjhaba tse ding** (Influence from other peoples) - The text mentions the influence of Arabia, Islam, and Europe.



Therefore, option C is the only one not supported by the provided text."
"Ho latela seratswana, Paseka e ketekwa jwang, haholo ke dikereke tsa setso?","The correct answer is **B: Ho tsamaisa mokete wa tebelo ya bosiu ba Moqebelo**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that many old churches have a ""Ho se Robala ka Paseka"" (Watch-the-Easter-Night) service on Holy Saturday night, celebrating Christ's resurrection. This directly aligns with option B, which describes a vigil service.
* The text also mentions the early Christian tradition of rising early to see the sun, but this isn't the primary way Easter is celebrated according to the text or the typical practice described.
* Option A refers to Lent, which is a different period of Christian observance.
* Option C is too general. While Easter is a time of celebration, the text focuses on a specific practice: the Easter Vigil.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Ele ho qoba tse ding tsa dipehelo tsa ho kena naheng ya Eucador, Moahi wa naha ya Cuba o lokela ho ba le eng pele?","The correct answer is **B: Lengolo la memo la molao (Legal memo)**.

The text explicitly states that Cuban travelers entering Ecuador as tourists or visitors must obtain a legal memo from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The other options are either related to visa requirements (C) or irrelevant (A & D).
"
Dipehelo tsa ho etela Ecuador ha di bolele eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho boloka lenane le lekaneng la batho ba kenang naheng eo.**

Here's why:

The text states that the requirements for a letter of invitation are established to provide a *structured flow of travel* between the two countries. This implies controlling the number of people entering Ecuador. Option B directly reflects this control by aiming to maintain a reasonable number of visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ho beha palo ya baeti boemong bo tlaase:** While managing visitor numbers might *result* in a lower number of visitors, the primary *goal* isn't just to lower the number; it's to manage the flow.
*   **C: Ho netefatsa nako eo moeti a tla dula naheng eo:** While the invitation letter mentions the duration of stay, the overarching purpose of the requirements isn't just about confirming the length of a visit.
*   **D: Ho netefatsa hore dibukana tsa ho eta di nakong:** The text focuses on the requirements for the invitation letter itself, not generally about entry procedures.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke efe e ditjeo di boima naheng tse ding ho feta naheng ya lehae?","The correct answer is **B: Dikhalase tsa mahlo tsa boemo bo hodimo (High-quality eyeglasses)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Diforeime tsa boleng bo hodimo tsa mabitso dibakeng tse jwalo ka tsena di ka ba le mathata a mabedi, tse ding e ka ba tse e seng tsa nnete, mme tsa nnete tse rometsweng naheng eo di ka bitsa tjhelete e ngata ho feta hae.""

This directly translates to: ""High-quality eyeglasses for such cases can have two problems, some may be fake, and the genuine ones sent to that country may cost more than at home.""

Therefore, high-quality eyeglasses are mentioned as being more expensive in other countries. The other options are either necessary for eye care (eye exams, insurance) or are simply a type of eyeglass (plain eyeglasses).
"
Bokotsi ba ho reka dikhalase tsa mahlo tsa boemo bo hodimo naheng e nngwe e ka ba bofeng?,"The correct answer is **C: E ka nna ya ba ke tsa bohata (They could be counterfeit).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Diforeime tsa boleng bo hodimo tsa mabitso dibakeng tse jwalo ka tsena di ka ba le mathata a mabedi, tse ding e ka ba tse e seng tsa nnete...""  This directly indicates that high-quality glasses in countries where costs are low *can* be counterfeit.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Tlhatlhobo e nngwe ya mahlo e ka nna ya hlokahala (Another type of eye exam might be needed):** While possible, the passage doesn't focus on the need for another exam. It focuses on the potential for counterfeit glasses.
* **B: Di ka nna tsa se sebetse diforeiming tse ding (They could use different frames):**  The passage doesn't suggest that the frames themselves are the problem, only their authenticity.
* **D: E ka nna ya ba inshorese e ka se di lefelle (They could be uninsured):** This is related to insurance coverage, but not the reason why high-quality frames might be counterfeit.



"
"Ho latela tshebediso ya tjhelete sebakeng sa Falkland, ho tse latelang, ke polelo efe eo eleng mafosisa?","The correct answer is **A: Dihlekehleke tse thoko le ditoropo di amohela feela dikarete tsa mokitlane le diponto tsa Borithane.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Diponto tsa Britain ka ho tlwaelehileng di tla amohelwa kae kapa kae dihlekehlekeng le dikareteng tsa ho reka ka sekoloto tsa Stanley le di dolara tsa United States le tsona hangata dia amohelwa.""
* **It further clarifies:** ""Dihlekehlekeng tse ka thoko dikarete tsa ho reka ka sekoloto di ke ke tsa amohelwa..."" This means that major establishments and towns primarily accept *either* Falkland currency *or* British pounds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Stanely ke sona sebaka feela se amohelang ditolara tsa Amerika:** The passage says US dollars are *often* accepted in Stanley, but not that it's the *only* place.
* **C: Diponto tsa Falkland di lokela ho tjhentjhwa ka mora ho tloha dihlekehlekeng:** The passage advises *against* exchanging Falkland currency outside of establishments, not that it needs to be exchanged upon leaving.
* **D: Ntle le diponto tsa Falkland, diponto tsa Borithane ke yona tjhelete e sebediwang haholo:** The passage indicates both Falkland currency and British pounds are used, but it doesn't say British pounds are *more* widely used. It highlights that British pounds are accepted.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ha motho a etela Falklands a tloha Amerika, ke hokae moo mofuta wa ho patala ntle le karete ya mokitlane, o ka bang le thuso?","The correct answer is **A: Lebenkeleng la FIC West**.

The text states: ""Tjhelete e ka fetolwa bankeng eo e leng yona feela sehlekehlekeng e leng Stanley ka nqane ha lebenkele la FIC West."" (Money can only be exchanged at the only bank, which is a small branch in Stanley at FIC West store.)

Therefore, FIC West is the only place mentioned where you can exchange currency.
"
Ke mokete ofe o sa amahangweng le diketekelo tsa tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho hlaha hwa tlou (The appearance of a whale)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that temple festivals are connected to temple celebrations, the birth of a deity, or significant events related to the temple. While the appearance of a whale might be a significant event in general, it isn't mentioned as being directly connected to the *temple's* celebrations or religious calendar.

The other options *are* mentioned as being related to temple festivals:

* **Sehopotso sa tempele (Temple celebration):** The passage states temple festival attendance is tracked as part of the temple celebration.
* **Letsatsi la tswalo la modingwana (Birth of a deity):** The passage mentions the birth of a deity as a reason for a temple festival.
* **Diketsehalo tsa bohlokwa tse amang tempele (Significant events relating to the temple):** This is a general category that directly aligns with the passage's description of temple festivals.



"
Ditlou tse kgabisitsweng di ka bonwa hokae?,"The correct answer is **C: Mekolokong e halalelang ka nako ya mekete ya ditempele/Mekolokong e halalelang nakong ya mekete ya ditempe.**

The text states: ""Bongata ba mekete ya tempele ya Kerala e thahasellisa haholo ho e bona, ka mokolokolo wa ka mehla wa ditlou tse kgabisitsweng, mmino wa diletsa tsa tempele le mekete e meng."" This directly links the elephants to the temple festivals and specifically mentions ""mekolokong e halalelang nakong ya mekete ya ditempele"" which translates to ""temple grounds during temple festivals"".
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke mokhwa ofe o ka sehloohong wa ho boloka tjhelete diteketeng tsa boemo bo hodimo e leng maemo a pele le maemo a bobedi a phahameng ka sefofaneng?","The correct answer is **B: Ho lefella tekete ya boemo bo hodimo ba pele ho feta boemo bo hodimo ba bobedi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the high cost of fast-tracking.** It states that fast-tracking can cost several times the normal business expenses, and significantly more for top positions.
* **The passage highlights the willingness of players to pay for fast-tracking.** It mentions a group ready to pay dollars for a quicker path, with costs escalating based on the position.
* **Option B directly addresses the cost management aspect.** By paying for the top position's fast-track before the second-highest, the company controls the expenditure.  They only incur the significant cost for the most critical fast-track.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ho tswa ditjeong tsa khampani ya hao:** This is not mentioned in the passage and doesn't address the high costs associated with fast-tracking.
    * **C: Ho lefella sefofane se o siyang tseleng sa tekete ya boemo bo hodimo ba pele:** This is a specific, costly action. Paying for *one* fast-track is a large expense, but doesn't manage the overall budget.
    * **D: Ho fumana dinyehlisetso:**  The passage implies a market where players *pay*, not receive, for fast-tracking.



Therefore, option B is the most logical answer based on the information provided.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng seo e ka bang tshenyo ya nako ho shebana le sona nakong ya ho lefella ditekete tsa maemo a fapaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Sefofane se fihlisang motho sebakeng seo a yang ho sona**.

Here's why:

The passage states that players are willing to pay a premium (higher than normal business costs) to quickly reach a desired location.  This is explicitly linked to the ""sefofane se fihlisang motho sebakeng seo a yang ho sona"" - the vehicle that transports people to the desired location.  It's the *transportation* cost that represents the time expense.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sebaka sa maemo a bobedi a hodimo ka sefofaneng:** This refers to the location itself, not the cost of getting there.
* **C: Dinyehlisetso:** The passage mentions that business loans aren't usually needed, so this is irrelevant.
* **D: Sebaka sa maemo a pele a hodimo ka sefofaneng:** Again, this refers to the location, not the transportation expense.



"
Ke eng e sa hlokeng ho eketswa ha motho a lekanya ditjeo tsa Afrika le ho ya mafatsheng a mang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditjeo tse ding tsa visa ho etela dibaka tse kantle ho Afrika**

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that when comparing travel costs to Africa, you should consider extra visa fees for countries *outside* of Africa. Options B, C, and D don't align with the passage's emphasis on external visa costs. The passage advises considering the cost of visas *for countries outside of Africa* in addition to comparing the cost of flights to Africa.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng seo mabenkele a qalellang ho fana ka sona ka mekgwa e fapaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Dijo tse phehilweng (Prepared foods)**.

The text states: ""Ho atang disuphamakete di fumana karolo e fapaneng haholo ya dijo tse lokiselleditsweng."" This translates to ""Pharmacies offer a wide variety of prepared foods.""  The passage then goes on to mention microwave meals and other heating methods, implying that prepared food is the foundation. Options B, C, and D are mentioned as *additional* offerings, not the initial offering.
"
Ke ntho efe e khahlang mabenkeleng e ka khahlang moreki ya rekang dijo tse phehilweng?,"The correct answer is **A: Dibaka tsa ho jella sebakeng seo (Eating areas there)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...he often has a small, often unregulated space for eating, where pre-prepared foods are often sold at lower prices."" This directly refers to eating areas within the supermarket where customers can eat the prepared food they purchased.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Khetho e tlase ya dintho tse fapaneng (Lower choice of various things):** While supermarkets *might* have lower-priced options, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as a key characteristic related to eating prepared food.
* **C: Dijo tse sa phehwang (Uncooked foods):** The passage is specifically about *prepared* foods (dijo tse lokiselleditsweng).
* **D: Sefuthumatsi sa dijo (Food warmer):** While some supermarkets might have food warmers, the passage primarily focuses on the eating area itself.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng e ke keng ya utluwa ke batho ba buang Sefora ba dinaha tsa Belgium le Switzerland?","The correct answer is **D: Boholo ba Sefora se buuwang Fora**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people who speak Sefora in Belgium and Switzerland will have studied the core Sefora dialect. This means they will likely understand the majority of Sefora speakers from other regions (like Fora), even if there are slight differences.

Therefore, they *will* understand the common ways of saying things (B), the standard written numbers (A), and other ways of saying things (C).  However, the passage implies that while there might be minor differences, they won't be drastically different from the core dialect, so it's not a significant barrier to understanding. The question asks what they *won't* understand, and the passage doesn't suggest they won't understand a majority of Fora speakers.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng e sa tshwaneng naheng ya Fora jwalo ka dinaheng tsa Belgium le Switzerland?","The correct answer is **B: Mokhwa wa ho ngola dipalo (Number writing system)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the *numbering system* at Sefora Belgium and Switzerland is different from Sefora in France.
* The passage mentions that people who speak Sefora in Belgium and Switzerland have learned the core Sefora system and can understand variations. This implies the core number system is likely shared.
* Options A, C, and D are all related to language and are unlikely to be drastically different, especially since speakers from Belgium and Switzerland have likely been trained on the core Sefora system.

Therefore, the most distinct difference mentioned is in the number writing system.



"
Ke maemong afe ao o ke keng wa fuwa tekete ya batho ba shwelletsweng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha o tsamaya ka sefofane sa WestJet**.

Here's why:

The passage states that WestJet is one of the airlines that *does* offer discounts for baggage fees, implying it's *not* the airline where you wouldn't be offered discounts.  The question asks where you *wouldn't* get discounts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha o lefa tekete ka kotloloho dikantorong tsa sefofane ho ena le ho ya ditshebeletsong tsa ejente ya maeto:** This option is irrelevant to whether you get discounts on baggage fees.
* **C: Ha o tsamaya ka sefofane sa Lufthansa ho tloha toropong ya Paris ho ya naheng ya Amerika:** The passage doesn't specify any different baggage fee policies for flights originating in Paris.
* **D: Ha o tsamaya ka sefofane sa Delta:** The passage lists Delta as an airline that offers baggage fee discounts.



Therefore, the only logically sound answer is A.
"
Keng seo eleng nnete ka ditefiso tsa batho ba shweletsweng?,"The correct answer is **A: Di kenyeletsa ditjeo tsa ho ya lefung**.

The provided text states that some airlines offer refunds for cancelled flights, which could include funeral expenses. The other options are incorrect based on the text:

* **B: Di lokela ho lefellwa feela marang-rang a khampani ya difofane:** The text mentions calling the airline for a full refund, suggesting other methods are available.
* **C: Di kenyeletsa le ditjeo tsa ho lefa motsotsong wa ho qetela:** The text only mentions ""ditjeo tsa ho palama,"" which translates to ""travel expenses"" or ""flight tickets.""
* **D: Di tlameha ho ngoliswa ka kotloloho le khamphani ka founu:** While calling the airline is recommended, the text doesn't specify a mandatory written notification.



"
Ke neng re ka bonang ho sebesisa motjhini wa GPS ho loketse ho feta marang-rang a GPS?,"The correct answer is **B: Ha o na le bonnete hore o tla ba le kgokelo ya marang-rang (You don't have a guarantee you'll have internet access)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...Haeba o se na kgokahano ya datha founung ya hao kapa ha e sa fihlellehe, ho sebetsa ha yona ho ka lekanyetswa kapa ya se ke ya sebetsa. (If you don't have phone data or it doesn't reach, it may not work or won't work at all.)""  This directly links the lack of internet access to GPS functionality.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ha o leka ho boloka tjhelete (When you are trying to save money):** While using a smartphone GPS can save money compared to buying new maps or renting a GPS, it's not the *primary* reason it might be preferred. The passage highlights the functionality issue first.
* **C: Ha o ya kantle ho sebaka (When you are going to a remote area):**  Going to a remote area *increases* the likelihood of needing GPS, not avoiding it.  Remote areas often have poor internet connectivity, making GPS even more valuable.
* **D: Ha o sa batle ho hira motjhini (When you don't want to rent a device):**  This is a preference, not a reason why you might choose smartphone GPS. The passage presents smartphone GPS as a viable *alternative* to renting.



"
Lebaka le sa nepahalang ka ho sebedisa marang-rang a GPS kgahlanong le motjhini wa GPS ke lefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ke ho se hloke ho tshwenyeha ka kgokelo ya marang-rang**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Haeba o se na kgokahano ya datha founung ya hao kapa ha e sa fihlellehe, ho sebetsa ha yona ho ka lekanyetswa kapa ya se ke ya sebetsa."" This means that a lack of internet connectivity is a significant drawback of using GPS on a smartphone compared to dedicated GPS devices or rented GPS units.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho boloka tjhelete:** While using a smartphone GPS can save money compared to buying new maps or renting, the passage highlights a major limitation (internet dependency), not cost savings as the *problem*.
*   **C: Ho qoba ho hira:**  The passage mentions that smartphones can be a cheaper alternative to renting a GPS, but this isn't the core issue.
*   **D: Ho se hloke ho reka dimmapa tse ntjha:**  This is a benefit of using a smartphone GPS, but not the problem being discussed.

Therefore, the lack of internet connectivity is the primary problem with relying on smartphone GPS for navigation."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka o fang tiisetse ya hore o palame sekepe se nepahetseng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho lefella ho ejente e sebetsanang le maeto a Galapagos.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tiiseha hore moemedi eo o beheletsang sebaka ho yena ke setsebi sa Galapagos ya nang le tsebo ya dikepe tse fapa-fapaneng."" (Ensure the person you book with is a Galapagos expert with knowledge of different boats.)
* Galapagos travel agents are the experts who can recommend the right boat for your interests and budget.  They will understand the different boat sizes and their suitability for various activities.
* The other options are not directly supported by the text:
    * **A:** While booking a group of 8 or more might influence boat selection, it's not the definitive guarantee of a suitable boat.
    * **B:** Booking during a quieter time might affect boat availability but doesn't guarantee the right fit.
    * **D:** Booking in advance is always a good practice, but doesn't ensure you'll get the boat that's best for *you*.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng ho tse latelang e sa sebedisweng e le leqheka la ho boloka baeti ho betjha?","The correct answer is **A: Bongata ba khanya ya tlholeho (Brightness of health)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that casinos use various strategies to keep guests there longer, including:

*   **Limited exits:** Making it difficult to leave.
*   **Specific amenities:** Offering food, drinks, and entertainment.
*   **Free drinks:** A common tactic to encourage gambling.
*   **Timekeeping:** Often using alarms and announcements to remind people of time.
*   **Security presence:**  To deter bad decisions and ensure rule enforcement.

""Bongata ba khanya ya tlholeho"" (Brightness of health) doesn't fit into any of these categories. It's unrelated to the strategies used to keep guests at a casino.

The other options are all strategies casinos *do* use:

*   **B: Ho fumantshwa ditekete tsa mahala tsa konsarete (Offering free concert tickets):** This is an amenity to keep guests entertained.
*   **C: Dino tsa mahala (Free drinks):**  A well-known tactic to encourage gambling.
*   **D: Ho hlokahala hwa tshupa-nako ya leboteng (Timekeeping of the venue):** Casinos often use timekeeping to remind people of time.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng eo batho ba betjhang ba lokelang ho e qoba?","The answer is **C: Ho sheba tshupa-nako ya letsoho kapa ya leboteng (Checking the time of the casino or the clock)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that casinos actively try to keep guests there as long as possible and make it difficult to leave.  One way they do this is by making it hard to know what time it is. Checking the time helps guests keep track of time and potentially decide to leave.  The passage also implies that gamblers are prone to poor decisions when impaired by alcohol.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ho nwa haholo (Drinking heavily):** While the passage mentions that gamblers make poor decisions when impaired by alcohol, it doesn't specifically say they should avoid drinking. It focuses on the casino's tactics.
* **B: Ho amohela ditlatsetso (Accepting comps/freebies):**  While casinos offer comps, the passage doesn't directly address whether gamblers should accept them.  The focus is on the difficult exit.
* **D: Ho botsa na monyako o haufi o hokae (Asking where the nearest exit is):**  This is a *result* of recognizing the difficulty of leaving, not something gamblers are specifically told to avoid *doing*. It's a consequence of the casino's tactics.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is **C**."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo dife tsa puo tse ngolwang ka tlhaku tse kgolo hara polelo?","The correct answer is **A: Maeetsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ho tsamaisana le lentswe Sie bakeng sa hao, o dula o qala ka tlhaku e kgolo, le ha e le hare ha polelo."" This translates to ""to structure a word for you, you always start with a large sound, and it is inside the word.""  This refers to the **initial consonant cluster**, which is often referred to as a **maeetsi** in Sesotho.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mareho** - This refers to the vowels within a word.
* **C: Dihlakisi** - This refers to prefixes or suffixes that modify the meaning of a word.
* **D: Maeketsi** - This refers to the syllable structure of a word.

Therefore, the passage explicitly indicates that the ""large sound"" at the beginning of a word is a **maeetsi** (initial consonant cluster)."
"Ho latela seratswana, ho ngola mareho ka ditlhaku tse kgolo ho ka baka bothata bofe?","The correct answer is **C: Ho ngola**.

Here's why: The passage states that writing is often made difficult by the need to find a way to represent a specific word or concept visually. This directly relates to the challenge of writing using large initial letters.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho bala (Reading):** The passage actually says that writing with large initial letters *can* make reading easier.
* **B: Ho kgetholla leetsi (Identifying a word):** While the passage mentions identifying a word, the primary difficulty is in the act of writing.
* **D: Ho kgetholla dintho (Identifying objects):** This isn't directly related to the core issue discussed in the passage.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: Ho ngola**."
Mahaeng a naha ya Malaysia lentswe “tloho” le bontshwa jwang?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho tsoka letsoho**.

The passage explicitly states that in Malaysia, a slight turn of the head (tsoka letsoho) indicates ""come here.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, lentswe “kgutla” le bontshwa jwang?","The correct answer is **C: Ho tsoka letsoho o le shebisa kantle**.

Here's why: The passage states that in Britain, a handshake can signify a good, sincere greeting and invite someone to come closer. Option C accurately reflects this meaning. The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

* **A: Ho tsoka letsoho ole shebisa ka ho wena:** While a handshake involves physical contact, this option doesn't capture the implied meaning of invitation or greeting described in the text.
* **B: Ho koba monwana wa bo supa:** This refers to a different cultural practice mentioned in the passage, not the meaning of a handshake in Britain.
* **D: Ho oma ka hlooho:** This gesture has a different meaning entirely, typically signifying agreement or acknowledgment.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e bakang ho petsoha ha maboloko a leqhwa?","The correct answer is **C: Mahaha a leqhwa a helehang.**

The passage states: ""Sena se tla baka ho petsoha, mapatso, hoo ka thbelwang ke marokgo a lehlwa. **Mabota le marulelo a mahaha a leqhwa a ka heleha mme ho petsoha ho kwalehe.**"" This directly links the presence of large, dry thorns to the occurrence of bushfires.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke dintho dife tse ka patwang ke matsaranka a lehlwa?","The answer is **C: Mabota**.

The text states: ""Mabota le marulelo a mahaha a leqhwa a ka heleha mme ho petsoha ho kwalehe."" This translates to: ""Feathers and large, old tree trunks can be found, and the erosion can be severe.""  Therefore, feathers are directly mentioned as something found where erosion occurs.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Letlere la majwe (Jewel necklace):** There's no mention of jewelry in the text.
* **B: Mahaha a nang le maqhwa ka dinako tsohle (Hairs that are always hairy):** This is not a common item found in erosion areas.
* **D: Maboloko a maqhwa a matenya (Thick feather tips):** While feathers *are* mentioned, the text specifically says ""mabota"" (feathers) making option C the best fit. ""Maboloko a maqhwa a matenya"" is more specific and less directly implied than just ""mabota"".



"
"Ho latela seratswana, baeti ba lokela ho ba sedi haholo ha ba etela sebaka sefeng?","The correct answer is **C: Bohareng ba toropo (The city center)**.

The text states: ""Leha Goma e sirelletsehile ka tsela e itseng, baeti bohle ba tswang kantle ho Goma ba lokela ho hlahlojwa ho utlwisisa boemo ba ntwa e tswelang pele profensing ya North Kivu. **Baeti bohle ba tswang kantle ho Goma ba lokela ho hlahlojwa ho utlwisisa boemo ba ntwa e tswelang pele profensing ya North Kivu.**"" This implies that visitors coming from within the city of Goma (specifically, the city center) need to be checked.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke boeletsi bofe bo sa nepahalang bakeng sa motho ya etelang sebaka sa Goma?","The correct answer is **C: Dithuthuthu tse lefellwang di hantle sebakeng sa ho tsamaya (Well-maintained buses are good for travel)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""O ka sebedisa boda-boda(tekesi ya sethuthuthu) ho pota-pota Goma."" This means minibuses are a common mode of transportation. It **does not** say buses are well-maintained.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible:

* **A: Dintwa Kivu e Leboya di a natefisa (North Kivu mountains are impressive):** The text mentions Goma is situated at the foot of the Nyiragongo volcano and near other low-cost tourist destinations in the Virunga Mountains. This suggests the area has impressive mountains.
* **B: Ke sebaka se setle sa ho boha ditshwene tsa dikorilla (It's a good place to hunt gorillas):** The Virunga Mountains are famous for gorilla trekking. The text positions Goma near these mountains, making gorilla hunting a possibility.
* **D: Motheo wa thaba ya seretse se tjhesang ya Nyiragongo o toropong (The core of the Nyiragongo volcano is in the town):** The text states Goma is ""at the foot of the Nyiragongo volcano"" and is ""home to the core of the Nyiragongo volcano.""

Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text is that well-maintained buses are available.



"
Lengolo la tumello le tla fumaneha neng ho etela sebaka se maluting maqalong a khwedi ya Phato?,"The correct answer is **A: La 1 Pherekhong**.

The text states: ""Phemiti ya naha thote e qalang ka Motsheanong e tla fumaneha ka **Pherekg**."" (National forest permits for the start of the season are available in **February**.)
"
Ke leano lefe le teng ho tshireletsa sebaka seo e leng khorwana?,"The correct answer is **D: Mangolo a tumello a mayane ka palo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Diphemiti dia fokola ka palo bakeng sa dikopo tsa batho ba itlelang feela ka leano la ya fihlileng pele, o sebeletswa pele.""  This translates to ""Permits are limited in number for those applying solely for walk-up reservations, and are reserved in advance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lengolo la tumello le fuwang ba le kopileng pele:** While pre-booked permits are mentioned, it's not the *reason* the permits are limited.
* **B: Mangolo a tumello a tla fumaneha feela ka la 1 Pherekhong:** The passage states permits are available on the first day of the month *four months before* the desired month.
* **C: Mangolo a tumello a ka fumanwa feela ha motho a ikopela ona dikantorong:**  The passage mentions walk-up reservations are reserved in advance, indicating that permits aren't *only* available at the offices.

Therefore, option D best reflects the core reason for permit limitations as explained in the text.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa fumaneheng ha bobebe mefutemg ya dihotele tse hlalositsweng seratswaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Bara e rekisang mofuta wa dino wa cocktails** (A bar selling a variety of cocktail drinks).

Here's why:

The passage describes luxurious hotels of a certain era. It mentions fine dining, entertainment, historical significance, and attracting dignitaries. However, it **doesn't mention** a bar with a variety of cocktails. The other options are plausible:

*   **B: Sebaka sa ho jella se maemong a hodimo se fumanehang moo** (An elevated dining area available there) - This aligns with the description of fine dining and luxurious amenities.
*   **C: Baeti mmoho ba tsebahalang haholo** (Highly prominent guests) - The passage states that these hotels often welcomed leaders and dignitaries.
*   **D: Diphaposi tse sa tswa lokiswa ka mekhwa ya moraorao** (Unnecessary decorations with old-fashioned methods) - The passage mentions antique furnishings and a unique aesthetic.

Therefore, the bar selling cocktails is the only element *not* mentioned in the description of these hotels."
"Ho latela ditaba tse seratswaneng, ho tse latelang, ke dintho dife tseo baeti ba ka hlokang thahasello haholo ho tsona?","The best answer is **B: Sebaka sa ho jella se nang le setsibi sa mopheho sa maemo a hodimo (A fine dining restaurant)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights that these hotels were known for:

* **Fine dining:** ""di dijo tse monate mme bosiu ho ketekwa"" (delicious food and nightly entertainment).
* **Luxury and indulgence:** ""batho ba ruileng le ba tummeng ba neng ba dula ho tsona"" (rich and famous people used to stay there).
* **Entertainment:** ""bosiu ho ketekwa"" (nightly entertainment).

Option B directly addresses the key aspect of luxury dining mentioned in the passage. While options A and C are related (luxury and entertainment), B is the *most* explicitly stated feature of these hotels. Option D is completely irrelevant to the context.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, batho ba etelang Greenland ba lokela ho qoba eng?","The correct answer is **B: Ho tla le diaparo tse boima ka ha ho tjhesa selemo kaofela.**

The text explicitly states: ""Go etela Greenland ka dinako tsa selemo tse batang (le ho nahanela hore haeba o ya ka leboya, ho tla bata haholo), ho bohlokwa hore o tshware diaparo tse futhumetseng ka ho lekaneng."" (Visiting Greenland at the peak of the season (and considering that if you go in winter, it will be very cold), it is important to wear warm clothes enough.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tse ding tsa dibaka tse tummeng ka botlokotsebe bo hodimo** (Some of the most popular places due to extreme cold): While extreme cold is a factor, the text isn't recommending visiting those places *because* of the cold. It's warning about the cold *when* visiting.
* **C: Ho nahana ho sebeletsa moo ka ha marang-rang a sokodisa** (Thinking about securing a place where the internet is fast): The text mentions internet access is generally good, but doesn't specifically say to prioritize securing a place *because* of fast internet.
* **D: Ho bitsa motho wa sebaka sa Greenland ka ho re “Eskimo”** (Calling a person from Greenland ""Eskimo""): The text strongly advises *against* using the term ""Eskimo"" due to its potentially offensive nature. It doesn't recommend doing it.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ka bakelang batho ba sa itlhopelang mathata ha ba etela Greenland?","The correct answer is **A: Mofuta wa monwang wa Nordic (Nordic fungi)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Le hoja di sa fetisetse malwetsi, empa di ka tena. (Even though they don't transmit diseases, they can cause them.)"" This refers to Nordic fungi, which can be a problem for visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Botlokotsebe (Crowding):** While the text mentions that the polar climate is the only danger people need to prepare for, it doesn't mention overcrowding as a risk.
* **C: Maemo a lehodimo (Extreme weather):** The text does mention extreme weather and the need for warm clothing, but it doesn't frame it as a reason *people won't prepare for* as much as the Nordic fungi.
* **D: Baahi ba lehae (Local residents):** The text provides information about the local residents and their customs, but it doesn't state that they pose a risk to visitors.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e seng e sebeliswa e le sebaka sa boikhathollo?","The correct answer is **C: Templo de San Diego**.

Here's why:

* **Jardín de la Unión** is described as a central hub with events happening day and night, including restaurants and concerts. It's clearly a place for gathering and social interaction.
* **Alley of the Kiss (Callejon del Beso)** is specifically mentioned as a place where people gather to hear the romantic legend.
* **Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss)** is described as a place for people to gather and hear the legend.
* **Templo de San Diego** is stated to be the *only* building that wasn't used as a phase for the 17th-century military festival. The question asks for something *not* used for social gathering. Since the other options *are* used for social gathering, the Templo de San Diego is the answer.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke eng e sa fumaneheng sebakeng sa Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: Tente e sebediswang ho tshwarela meketjana ya dipina (Tent used to host fairs)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ho na le dibaka tsa ho jela tse mmalwa tse potolohileng serapa, mme thapama le mantsiboya ho na hangata tenteng e bohareng."" (There are a few cramped outdoor dining areas, and the upstairs and terrace often host tents inside.)  This implies tents *are* present, but not specifically for fairs.
* The text *does* mention Callejon del Beso (the alley of the kiss) and it is described as the location of the old love story.
* The text *does* mention cramped outdoor dining areas.
* The text doesn't mention old architectural ruins.



Therefore, the only thing *not* mentioned as being present in Jardín de la Unión is a tent used to host fairs.



"
"Ha latela seratswana, ke polelo efe ho tse latelang e buang ka ho hlwa dithaba e sa nepahalang?","The correct answer is **B: Bohole bo ka fapana empa bo reretswe ho fela ka letsatsi.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ho hahlaula naha ho ka qetwang ka letsatsi ho akarelletsang bohole bo ka tlaase ho mile ho ya ho bohole bo botelele bo ka finyellwang ka letsatsi le le leng."" This directly translates to ""Downhill hiking can be completed in a day, starting with moderate weather to potentially extreme weather reached the next day.""
* Option B accurately reflects this information. It talks about the potential variation in weather and the possibility of it lasting until the next day.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Boitukiso bo bonyane bo ntse bo hlokahala bakeng sa ho hlwa dithaba ka letsatsi ditseleng tse bonolo** (Minimal preparation is always needed for downhill hiking on easy trails). While some preparation is always good, the passage emphasizes that even beginners can enjoy it. The statement about ""always"" is too strong.
* **C: Batho ba kwetlileng ka kakaretse ba ka natefelwa ke papadi ena** (Completely unfit people can enjoy this activity). The passage acknowledges that families with young children might need more preparation, implying that completely unfit people might struggle.
* **D: Ho hlwa dithaba ka letsatsi ha hwa lokela malapa a nang le bana** (Downhill hiking on a day is not suitable for families with children).  The passage states the opposite: that families can enjoy it, especially when children are older.



Therefore, option B is the only one that directly aligns with the information provided in the passage."
"Ho latela seratswana, ho hlwa dithaba ka letsatsi ho hloka boitukisetso bo fokolang neng?","The correct answer is **A: Ha motho ya hlwang dithaba a kwetlile hantle** (If the person who hikes is well-trained).

Here's why:

The text states that for a simple day hike, minimal preparations are needed and almost anyone can enjoy it. It also says that even families with young children can easily check outside every day, except when there are insects and children are starting school.  The key is that *a well-trained person* can handle the basic preparations needed for a day hike. The other options aren't directly supported by the text as being the *only* required minimal preparation:

* **B: Ha ditsela di tsamaeha** (If the paths are well-maintained): While well-maintained paths are helpful, the text doesn't say it's *essential* for minimal preparation.
* **C: Ha bana ba lo hlwa dithabaka** (If children are not being carried): Carrying children adds to the preparation needed.
* **D: Ha ho hlwa dithaba ka tikolohong ya tlhaho** (If hiking in a natural environment):  Hiking in a natural environment *implies* you're prepared for the environment, which requires some level of planning, even if minimal.



"
Sehlaba sa sebaka sa Rogaland kapa Agder se fapane jwang papisong le Norway kaofela?,"The correct answer is **A: Di na le difate** (They have fences).

Here's why:

The passage states that Norway is generally known for **high mountains and flat areas**. It then contrasts Rogaland and Agder, saying they are typically called ""hei,"" which refers to **open spaces with no fences** and often covered in low-growing vegetation.

Therefore, the difference is that Rogaland and Agder (specifically ""hei"") **do not have fences**, unlike the more general description of Norway. The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **B: Ha ho na metsi a pakeng tsa mafika** (There is no water between the peaks): The passage doesn't mention water.
*   **C: Boholo ba dihlaba di a lekana** (Most of the mountains are equal): The passage describes Norway as having high mountains, which implies they are not all equal.
*   **D: Boholo di kwahetswe ke dimela tse tala** (Most of them are covered in low-growing vegetation): While ""hei"" is covered in low-growing vegetation, the passage *also* emphasizes the absence of fences as a defining characteristic of ""hei."""
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e sa twaelehang ka sebaka sa Norway?","The correct answer is **B: Dihlaba tse morung (Mountains)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically describes Norway as having *flat, elevated plateaus* called ""vidde"" and open, treeless areas called ""hei.""  It explicitly contrasts these with mountains.  Therefore, mountains are presented as *not* typical of Norway.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dibaka tse bulehileng (Open spaces):** The text describes ""vidde"" and ""hei"" as open spaces, so this *is* typical.
*   **C: Metsi a tibileng a pakeng tsa mafika (Deep lakes between mountains):** While Norway *does* have lakes, the text doesn't highlight them as defining features. The focus is on the plateau and open areas.
*   **D: Dihlaba tse mangope (Rocky mountains):** While Norway has mountains, the text implies they aren't the most characteristic feature, as it focuses on the flat areas.



"
Bahahlaudi ba ratang ho thelledisa ba tjhakela dibaka tse dithota neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Nakong ya lehlabula la India**.

The text states: ""Nako ya bahahlaudi bakeng sa dibaka tsa maralla ka kakaretso e hodimo nakong ya lehlabula la India..."" which translates to ""The time for woodpeckers for nesting at a high level is during the Indian summer...""

Therefore, woodpeckers nest during the Indian summer.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, bahahlaudi ba bangata haholo neng diseteishineng tse dithoteng?","The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya ho kgethea hwa lehlwa le lengata**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the blackbuck population is at its highest during the Indian monsoon season. It also mentions that these deer are often found in large numbers during the *gathering of the herd* (ho kgethea hwa lehlwa le lengata). This indicates that the blackbuck congregate in large numbers during this period.  While they may be present during the entire growth period (B), and during the monsoon (C), the gathering of the herd is specifically highlighted as a time of large numbers.  The passage also doesn't associate them specifically with the dry season (D).



"
Seo o lokeng ho qoba ho se etsa haeba o na le tshepo ya ho fumana seketswana se hlokang thuso ke sefe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho bapatsa ditshebeletso tsa hao**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes networking and offering assistance to gain visibility.** Option C, ""Ho bapatsa ditshebeletso tsa hao"" (Offer your services), directly aligns with this advice. It encourages the person to actively promote their skills and what they can do to help others, which will lead to recognition and referrals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho ya hodimo le tlaase seemelong sa diketswana (Going up and down the marina):** While observing is helpful, this is a passive approach. The passage encourages active engagement and offering help, not just wandering around.
* **B: Ho theha setswalle le batsamaisi (Forming a partnership and managers):** This is a long-term strategy and not the immediate action the passage is describing. It's more about building a business structure later.
* **D: Ho iphapanyetsa batho ba kopang palamiswa (Making friends with people who meet in the marina):**  While networking is important, the passage focuses on offering *services* to gain visibility, not just making friends.  The friend-making is a byproduct of offering value.



Therefore, **C** is the best fit because it directly relates to the passage's core message of active participation and offering value to gain recognition in the marina.



"
O lokela ho etsang seemelong sa diketswana nakong eo o batlanang le seketswana se hlokang thuso?,"The best answer is **A: Ho kopana le basesisi ba diketswana (Meeting yacht owners)**.

Here's why:

* **The context of the first question:** The first question describes a strategy for gaining visibility and finding clients in a marina.  It emphasizes networking with yacht owners and potential buyers.
* **Why A fits:** Meeting yacht owners directly aligns with the first question's advice to network and promote your services. It's about building relationships with the people who are most likely to need your help.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: E ba ka tla sa motjhini wa sebonela hole (They might come without arriving at the marina).** While possible, it's not a proactive strategy.  The question is about what you should *do* at the marina.
    * **C: Atamela batho feela ha ba hlwekisa seketswana sa bona sa boleng (Only approach people who maintain their yachts well).** This is limiting.  You might help someone with a less-maintained yacht who still needs assistance.  It also creates a potentially judgmental atmosphere.
    * **D: Qoba batho ba ratang ho kopa phalamiswa (Avoid people who want to ask for assistance).** This is completely unprofessional and against the spirit of helping others.


Therefore, networking with yacht owners is the most logical and effective action to take in the described scenario."
Ke sebaka sefe se ka ratwang ke bahahlaudi nalaneng ya sehlekehleke sa bokolone?,"The correct answer is **B: Sebakeng sa Kowloon se pela metsi**.

The text explicitly states: ""...ye lebopong la lewatle la Kowloon le lebaneng le yona."" which translates to ""...and go to the waterfront of Kowloon which is opposite it."" This indicates that Kowloon's waterfront is a popular spot for tourists.
"
Ke sebaka se fe se ka khahlang bahahlaudi ba shebanang haholoholo le dibaka tse kgahlang mahlo?,"The correct answer is **C: Sehlekehleke sa Hong Kong**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Sehlekehleke sa Hong Kong se fa sebaka sa Hong Kong lebitso la sona mme ke sebaka seo bahahlaudi ba bangata ba se nkang jwaloka sebaka sa ho eta se ka sehloohong."" (Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists take as a starting point.)
* The passage also mentions that the skyline of Hong Kong Island is often compared to a ""chateng ya dithutswana e phatsimang e entsweng ke ho ba teng ha metsi a Victoria Harbour."" (The skyline of Hong Kong Island is often compared to a ""branching tree"" created by the presence of Victoria Harbour.)

The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

* **A: Seemelong sa dikepe sa Victoria** (Victoria Dockside) is a specific area *within* Hong Kong Island, not the entire island itself.
* **B: Hong Kong e loketse** (Hong Kong is suitable) is too general.
* **D: Sebakeng sa Kowloon se pela metsi** (The waterfront area of Kowloon) is a different location than Hong Kong Island.



"
Disale tse ding di na le eng e thusang khahlanong le menyatla ya kotsi e etsang hore leoto la sepalami le tshwarehe ka hara moraho wa sale?,"The correct answer is **C: Moraho wa letlalo (Loop for the stirrup)**.

The passage states: ""Disale tse ding, ka ho kgethehileng disale tsa Senyesemane, di na le ditshepe tsa ho sireletseha tse dumellang letlalo la stirrup hore le we ho tswa saleng haeba se hulelwa morao ke mopalami ya welang fatshe.""  This directly refers to a loop or mechanism on the stirrup that allows it to release if the rider falls backward.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Disole tse patisaneng (Reinforced leather)** - While reinforced leather increases durability, it doesn't prevent the stirrup from catching the rider's leg.
* **B: Mekwallo ya polokeho (Safety buckles)** -  Buckles are generally used to secure things, not release them in a fall.
* **D: Ho tsitsa ho khotsofatsang (Comfortable padding)** - Padding improves comfort, but it doesn't address the risk of the leg getting caught in the stirrup.



"
Ke karolo efe ya dieta tsa bapalami e ba thusang ho ntlafatsa polokeho ya bona ha ba sebedisa moraho wa sale?,"The correct answer is **B: Letlalo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Disale tse ding, ka ho kgethehileng disale tsa Senyesemane, di na le ditshepe tsa ho sireletseha tse dumellang letlalo la stirrup hore le we ho tswa saleng haeba se hulelwa morao ke mopalami ya welang fatshe.""  This directly indicates that the *letlalo* (stirrup) is a safety feature that prevents the stirrup from getting trapped if the rider falls backward.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sole e thata e mopatisane (Hard sole):** While a hard sole is part of riding boots, it doesn't specifically address stirrup safety.
* **C: Serethe (Filter):** The filter is mentioned in relation to the boot's upper part, but not as a primary safety feature concerning stirrups.
* **D: Sole e sephara (Separate sole):**  This refers to a type of boot sole, but not a key safety mechanism related to stirrups.



"
Ke eng se ka fuwang baeti ho marangrang a kamohelo ya baeti?,"The correct answer is **C: Maeto tlasa bolaodi ba batho ba lehae** (Accommodation under the supervision of local residents).

Here's why:

* The text describes a welcoming system for visitors where they stay with local people. This is the definition of accommodation under the supervision of local residents.
* Options A and B are irrelevant to the text.
* Option D is too general and doesn't capture the core concept of the described system.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects what guests receive in a welcoming host system.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke polelo efe ho tsa marang-rang a kamohelo ya baeti eo e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Ka nako e nngwe baeti ba ka fumana lethathamo la maikutlo ka batho ba dulang le baeti**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes hospitality platforms connecting travelers with locals.**  These platforms usually provide information about locals who are willing to host guests.
* **Options A, B, and C are all plausible features of such platforms.**  Providing a list of potential hosts, ways to verify hosts, and a list of hosts in a town all align with the described function.
* **Option D (a list of *feelings* about hosts) is less likely.** While reviews and ratings are common, a list of ""feelings"" isn't a typical or practical feature of a hospitality platform.  Reviews usually offer more concrete feedback.



Therefore, option D is the statement that is least likely to be a feature of a hospitality platform described in the passage.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa baeti o sa fumaneheng habobe diphaphosing tse kopanetsweng tsa boroko?","The correct answer is **A: Moeti ya dilemong tse mashome a mabedi (A 20-year-old)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that hostels are often targeted towards **young people in their twenties**, but older travelers are also common.
* The question asks which type of guest is *not* typically found in combined booking.
* While older travelers and families with young children might be present, the text specifically implies that a 20-year-old is the *typical* guest. Therefore, a 20-year-old wouldn't be *unexpected* in a combined booking.

The other options are more likely to be found:

* **B: Moeti ya tsamayang a lemong (A 20-year-old)** - as stated in the text.
* **C: Moeti ya tsamayang le bana ba banyane (A traveler with young children)** - families are commonly found in hostels.
* **D: Moeti ya bohareng ba dilemo di mashome a mararo (A 30-year-old)** -  30-year-olds are a common age for hostel guests.



Therefore, a 20-year-old is the most unexpected among the choices presented.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya ka nnang a dula sebakeng sa bodulo se kopanetsweng?","The correct answer is **A: Baratani ba tsamayang le ngwana ya qetang ho hlaha**.

Here's why: The question states that hostels can accommodate families, particularly those with young children. Option A describes a family with a young child, which aligns with this possibility.  Options B and C are not described in the text. Option D mentions two families, which is possible, but the phrasing of the question (""malapa a nang le bana ke ka sewelo a bang teng"") suggests a more general accommodation of families.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke polelo efe e hlalosang ka nepo papali ya Boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: E tla khutlela ho wena ha o e bitsitse ka nepo** (It will return to you if you throw it correctly).

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes that a good boomerang *returns* to the thrower. Option A directly reflects this key characteristic.
* Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:
    * B is irrelevant to the function of a boomerang.
    * C is factually incorrect; boomerangs are found in Australia.
    * D is misleading; many boomerangs are designed to return.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sebeliswang haholo mokhweng wa ho pheha wa Javanese?","The correct answer is **C: Tswekere ya khokhonate (Coconut chili)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...diso tsa Java di akarelletsa dijo tse ngata tse nokilweng habonolo, di-chilli, **tswekere (haholo-holo tswekere ya Java ya kokonate)**...""

Therefore, coconut chili is mentioned as a prominent ingredient in Javanese cuisine.

"Ho latela seratswana, mafu a tshwaetsanang a nama jwang?","The correct answer is **C: Baktheria**.

Here's why:

The question asks what causes contagious diseases according to the text. The text states that contagious diseases are caused by things like ""dikokwana-hloko, dibaktheria, fungus kapa dipharasaete"" (bacteria, fungi, or parasites).  Of the options provided, bacteria is listed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Batho ba tshwaelitsweng (Susceptible people):** People are *affected* by contagious diseases, but they don't *cause* them.
* **B: Kokwana-hloko ya pathogen (Pathogen's nucleus):** This isn't a recognized term in the context of disease causation.  A pathogen is the disease-causing agent.
* **D: Diente (Teeth):** Teeth are not related to the causes of contagious diseases.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e sa tsejweng e ka bakang mafu a tshwaetsanang?","The correct answer is **B: Dikokwana-hloko (Viruses)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that **bolwetsi bo tshwaetsanang (contagious disease)** is caused by things like **dikokwana-hloko (viruses)**, bacteria, fungus, or parasites.
* The question asks what *sa tsejweng* (is not included) as a cause of contagious disease *according to the text*.
* The other options (dikokwana-hloko, dibaktheria, difungus) are all listed in the text as potential causes.  Therefore, **diente (teeth)**, which is not mentioned as a cause of contagious disease in the text, is the correct answer. Although teeth themselves aren't *directly* a cause of contagious disease, the question is looking for the item NOT listed.


Therefore, the answer is **B: Dikokwana-hloko (Viruses)**. The question is subtly testing if you understand what *is* included, rather than what isn't. Since viruses are listed as causes of contagious disease, and teeth are not, teeth is the answer.

However, looking more carefully, I realize that ""diente"" is a typo and should be ""Dientes"" which means ""teeth"" in Spanish. Teeth themselves don't *cause* contagious disease. The virus that *can be spread* when someone has a dental issue (like gingivitis) is what causes the contagious aspect. The question is poorly worded. However, given the options provided, the closest answer reflecting that teeth themselves aren't a direct cause is ""Dientes"".

**Therefore, considering the flawed wording and the options, I'm leaning towards the best *intended* answer being B (Viruses) but a corrected answer would be Dientes (teeth)**. I'll go with the corrected one as the more technically accurate response.

Ke maemong afe ao ho ka kgethwang marang-rang a inthanete ho ena le VPN ya motho ka mong ho ka lokelang mosebedisi?,"The best answer is **A: Mosebedisi o batla ho fapohisa sephethephethe kaofela (The user wants to hide their entire identity)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that VPNs provide a layer of anonymity for all internet traffic, not just web browsing.** It mentions ""sephethephethe sohle sa Inthanete"" (all internet traffic).
* **Options B and C are too specific.** While VPNs can *help* with bypassing restrictions and hiding IP addresses (as mentioned in the question), the primary benefit described in the passage is overall anonymity.  Options B and C focus on specific use cases (bypassing restrictions, hiding IP address), but don't encompass the broader concept.
* **Option D is less directly related to the core function of a VPN.** While a VPN *can* provide a more secure network, its primary role isn't to provide a ""hlwahlwa"" (secure network) in the sense of a dedicated, high-security network.

Therefore, the user wanting to hide their *entire* identity aligns best with the broader purpose of a VPN as described in the passage.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe eo e seng nnete ka VPN le Web Proxies?","The correct answer is **D: Di VPN di fetola feela tsela ya sephethephethe sa mofuta wa http**

Here's why:

* **VPNs** encrypt all internet traffic, not just HTTP. They create a secure tunnel for *all* your online activity, including HTTPS, FTP, and other protocols.
* **Web proxies** typically only handle HTTP and sometimes HTTPS traffic.
* **A: Di VPN di hlwahlwa ho feta Web proxies** - This is generally true. VPNs offer more comprehensive security and privacy.
* **B: We proxies di ka se fetole tsela ya sephethephethe sa batho ba kenang ho marangrang** - This is true. Proxies act as an intermediary, masking the user's IP address.
* **C: Web proxies di na le ditshebeletso tsa boleng bo tlase papisong le di VPN** - This is usually true. VPNs generally offer better performance and security than web proxies.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that is false."
Ke eng se ka dumellang motho ho sebedisa khamphani ya mehala e kantle ho sebaka sa moo a le teng?,"The correct answer is **B: Dinomoro tse sebetsang lefatshe lohle (Worldwide phone numbers)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that you can use a single, worldwide phone number to make calls that connect to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).  This allows you to call from anywhere, even if the number isn't located in the country you're currently in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho letsa ka marang-rang (Calling over the internet):** While internet calling (VoIP) is *one way* to do this, the passage specifically mentions the use of a *single number* for PSTN connections, which is a broader concept than just VoIP.
* **C: Sathalaete (Satellites):** Satellites are not the primary method discussed for making international calls.
* **D: Difono tsa PSTN (PSTN Phones):** PSTN phones are tied to a specific location and wouldn't allow you to easily make calls from a different country without additional services.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng se ka etswang ho amohela mehala e itseng?","The correct answer is **A: Ho reka nomoro e letsetsang lefatshe lohle (Buying a global toll-free number)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hangata, o lokela ho reka nomoro ya lefatshe lohle e le nngwe e dumellang mehala ya PSTN hore e ho letsetse.""  This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho sebedisa khamphani ya lehae ya mehala (Using a local phone company):** The passage argues *against* needing to use a local phone company because calls are routed through the internet.
* **C: Ho fumana nomoro ya sebakeng se haufinyane (Getting a local number):** The passage says it's not necessary to get a local number because of internet-based calls.
* **D: Ho reka fono ya moetso wa PSTN (Buying a PSTN gateway phone):** While a PSTN gateway *can* be used, the passage implies it's often unnecessary and that a global toll-free number is a more common solution for international calls.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe, e sa hlaloseng ka nepo ho bitswa hwa mantswe a Setadiana?","The correct answer is **A: Di “r” tse pedi di bitswa ka tsela e fapaneng le “r” e le nngwe**.

Here's why:

* **The core concept of Italian pronunciation is that the letters generally correspond to their sounds.** While there are exceptions, the statement that double ""r"" (rr) is pronounced differently than a single ""r"" is a fundamental aspect of Italian pronunciation. This difference is a core rule.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Boholo ba mantswe a bitswa jwalo ka ha a ngotswe:** This is largely true. Italian spelling is quite phonetic.
* **C: Mantswe a nang le “c” le “g” a ka sokodisa:** This is also true. The ""c"" and ""g"" have different sounds depending on the following vowel (e.g., ""c"" before ""e"" or ""i"" is pronounced like ""ch,"" ""g"" before ""e"" or ""i"" is pronounced like ""j"").
* **D: Ho bitswa hwa mantswe ho fapana ho latela seduma-nosi se hlahlamang:** This is also true. Italian pronunciation is influenced by stress and vowel sounds.



Therefore, option A highlights a key rule of Italian pronunciation, making it the only statement that is *not* accurately describing how Italian words are pronounced.



"
Ke ditshobotsi dife tsa toropo ya Izmir tse qadileng pele ho matsatsi a moraorao?,"The correct answer is **D: Marulelo a dithaele tse kgubedu (Seven-story buildings)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...dithaba, **meaho e entsweng ka di kgalase ka pele le disenthara tsa mabenkele tsa sejwale-jwale tse nang le marulelo a dithaele tse kgubedu**..."" (hills, first-floor buildings and modern shops with **seven-story balconies**...). This indicates that seven-story buildings are a prominent and characteristic feature of Izmir.

While the other options are features of the city, the text highlights the seven-story balconies as particularly noteworthy.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe eo eseng tshobotsi ya nnete ya toropo ya Izmir?","The correct answer is **B: Boemo ba yona bo fana ka sebophe sa setso sa naha ya Turkey**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that although Izmir has modern features, ""the city feels like a Mediterranean Europe with a Turkish town."" This directly contradicts the statement that its location provides a typical representative of Turkey's national character.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the text:

* **A: Toropo e potapotile kou e kgolo:** The text describes Izmir as ""potapotileng kou e kgolo mme se pota-potilwe ke dithaba"" (built up and large, and surrounded by hills).
* **C: O ka fumana setsi sa mabelenke sa sejwale-jwale le dikereke tsa kgale:** The text mentions ""ditherata tse sephara, meaho e entsweng ka di kgalase ka pele le disenthara tsa mabenkele tsa sejwale-jwale tse nang le marulelo a dithaele a moetlo tse kgubedu, meaho e entsweng ka di kgalase ka pele le disenthara tsa mabenkele tsa sejwale-jwale tse nang le marulelo a dithaele a moetlo tse kgubedu, le di-mosque tsa kgale le dikereke"" (apartments, modern houses, and modern shopping malls, as well as old mosques and churches).
* **D: E na le seemelo sa dikepe sa bobedi se seholo Turkey:** The text mentions ""seemelo sa dikepe sa bobedi se seholo Turkey"" (Turkey's second largest shopping district).



"
Lentswe “hanami” le bolela ho boha eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Moetlo wa Japane wa bohlomphehi ba tswalo**.

The passage states that ""hanami"" is a custom in Japan that started as viewing cherry blossoms from the Imperial Court. This indicates it's a cultural tradition. Option B best reflects this meaning.
"
Ke mang ya qalileng ho etsa mekete ya boithabiso ya ho boha difate tsa lithungthung tsa dicheri?,"The correct answer is **A: Morena wa China**.

The text states: ""Kgopolo e hlahile Chaena moo dipalesa tsa sefate sa purumu e ne le palesa e ratwang."" This translates to ""The custom originated in China where plum blossoms were a beloved flower.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke dikarolo dife tsa Jerusalema tse ke keng tsa kgahla bahahlaudi haholo?","The correct answer is **C: Moetlo wa ho etsa dihlabelo (Tradition of making pilgrimages)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Jerusalem is a holy city for three religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  This implies the *tradition of pilgrimage* is a significant aspect of Jerusalem's importance to these faiths. The question asks what's *not* highlighted in the text.  The text *does* highlight the religious importance, the city's status as a major city of Israel, and its historical significance.  Therefore, the tradition of pilgrimage is the aspect *not* emphasized.



The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Bohlokwa ba bodumedi toropong (Religious importance of the city):** The text directly says Jerusalem is a setsi sa bomoya, bodumedi, le setso (a spiritual, religious, and cultural center).
*   **B: Boemo ba yona ba hore ke motse-moholo wa Iseraele (Its status as a major city of Israel):** The text says Jerusalem is one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Israel *because* of its importance.
*   **D: Dibaka tse ngata tsa nalane (Many historical sites):** The text mentions numerous historical and ancient sites.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng e sa bolelwang seratswaneng e tsebahalang haholo ka Jerusalema?","The correct answer is **C: Bohlokwa ba bodumeli (Religious significance)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Jerusalem is a ""setsi sa bomoya, bodumedi, le setso"" - meaning a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.  It highlights that it's holy to three major religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
* While the other options are true of Jerusalem to some extent, the text *emphasizes* its religious importance more strongly than its political, geographical, or cultural aspects.

Therefore, the answer that best represents something *highlighted* as important in the text is its religious significance.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke baeti bafe ba ke keng ba una molemo ha ba reka karete e bitswang Wild Card?","The correct answer is **D: Moeti ya rerileng ho etela sebaka sa Kruger sa diphoofolo tse hlaha le dibakeng tse ding.**

Here's why:

The text states that the Wild Card allows entry to *different* parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.  Therefore, someone planning to visit Kruger *and* other parks would benefit from the Wild Card.  The other options are not directly addressed or related to the benefit/drawback of purchasing a Wild Card.
"
Ke polelo efe e sa hlaloseng ka nepo sebaka sa Kruger sa diphoofolo tse hlaha?,"The correct answer is **C: E nyane ka ho fitisisa dibakeng tsa Afrika Borwa tsa diphoofolo tse hlaha** (It is smaller than most wildlife areas in South Africa).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Serapa ke sebaka se 19,500 km²..."" which indicates a significant size, not small.
* **The text highlights:** The park's diverse ecosystems and wildlife, suggesting it is *not* smaller than most wildlife areas.
* **Options A and B are supported by the text:**  It says Kruger is a major wildlife area in South Africa, and the ecosystems contribute to the variety of animals.
* **Option D is also supported:** The text explicitly mentions the need for entrance fees and the benefit of a Wild Card.

Therefore, option C directly contradicts the information provided in the text.



"
Ke eng enka bakang mathata ho batho ba hlwang dithaba moo di leng telele?,"The correct answer is **A: Maemo a mongobo (Altitude)**.

The passage explicitly mentions that the altitude makes the climb challenging (""Ho bonahala ho tshosa hanyenyane ho tloha tlaase""). It also warns about the effects of the thin air (""lebella hore o tla fellwa ke moya""). The other options are mentioned as aids or features of the trail, not the primary cause of difficulty due to altitude.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke polelo efe e sa nepahalang mabapi le bophahamo bo otlolohileng ba thaba ya Machu Picchu bo hlalositsweng seratswaneng?","The correct answer is **D: Bophahamo ba thaba bo ba kotsi ha ho le mongobo** (The mountain's height is not dangerous when there is no rain).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states the mountain is dangerous *when it rains*.**  It mentions slippery sections and the risk of rapid flooding.
* Option D directly contradicts this information.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: Bahlwi ba dithaba ba kwetlileng ba ka fellwa ke moya** (Trekking people can be affected by the wind): The text says ""Lebella hore o tla fellwa ke moya"" (Expect to be affected by the wind).
* **B: Ha ho na moo ho itshwareletswang bophahamong bohle ba thaba** (There is no place where one is protected from the mountain's height): The text describes sections with steps and handrails but also mentions exposed areas.
* **C: O lokela ho feta le lehaheng le hodimo** (You should also go over the small lehaheng (lake) nearby): The text mentions a small lake near the summit that you are expected to cross.



Therefore, option D is the only one that presents information inconsistent with the provided text.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke dijo dife tseo e seng tsa mantlha tsa Majorcan?","The correct answer is **C: Dijo-thollo (Vegetables)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Majorcan cuisine is based on fish, meat, and especially lamb, and uses olive oil extensively.  Simple southern dishes often include tomatoes, tuna, and other available ingredients like eggplant.  While vegetables are *used*, the text doesn't emphasize them as a core component in the same way it does fish, meat, and lamb. Therefore, ""vegetables"" is the least emphasized food group in the described cuisine.
"
"Ho ipapisitswe le seratswana, ke polelo efe eseng nnete ka dijo tse phehelwang ka mokoting?","The correct answer is **C: Hangata dijo tsa matsiboya tse hadikilweng diphehwa ka mokoting (Often cooked lamb dishes are found in geothermal areas)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** Geothermal areas are known for cooking food using heat from the earth (hot springs or naturally occurring ground heat). It doesn't specifically mention lamb dishes being commonly found. 
* **The other options are supported by the text:**
    * **A:** The text mentions using geothermal heat from the earth (mollong) to cook.
    * **B:** The text states geothermal areas in Rotorua, Christchurch, and Wellington produce hangi.
    * **D:** The text specifically mentions Rotorua as a place where hangi is available.

Therefore, option C is the statement that is *not* supported by the information provided in the text.



"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang e le tlwelaelo ya ho phehela mokoting ya ho futhumatsa sekoti?,"The correct answer is **C: Mobu o tjhesang**.

Here's why:

The passage states that geothermal heat can be used to heat buildings. It specifically mentions:

*   Geothermal heat can come from underground hot springs (caused by minerals from the earth).
*   Geothermal activity can naturally heat the ground.
*   Geothermal energy is used for hot pools.
*   Geothermal heat is available in Rotorua, Christchurch, Wellington, and other places.

While minerals and hot springs (which are often mineral-rich) are mentioned as sources of geothermal heat, **mud** is not typically associated with being used for heating buildings in this context. Mud is more commonly associated with mud pools or mud baths, not direct heating of structures.

Therefore, mud is the least likely option to be used for heating buildings using geothermal energy."
Ke eng e ka bakwang ke ho fumana temoho e kgethehileng ya baitlami ba basadi le ba banna?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho apara lesela le ithatelang le kganyang (Wearing a comfortable and matching sweater)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the importance of wearing appropriate attire when visiting a lodge.** It specifically mentions sweaters for both men and women.
* **It highlights the effect of matching colors.**  Matching sweaters are mentioned to create a positive impression.
* **Option A accurately reflects the advice given in the text.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho kwahela mahetla (Waving hands)** -  This is a gesture, not an article of clothing.
* **C: Ho kadima lesela le ithatelang mmeleng boitlaming (Putting on a comfortable sweater on the body)** - This is repetitive and not the main point. The text focuses on *matching* colors.
* **D: Ho apara mose o ka hodima lengwele (Wearing a shirt that can be rolled up)** - While shirts might be acceptable, the text specifically mentions sweaters as a key item of clothing.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke mefuta efe ya diphahlo e ka adingwang matlong a baitlami? ","The text explicitly states that **dikhete (ties)** are a type of clothing that men can wear at traditional ceremonies. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Dikhete**.
"
Baeti ba ka ba le monyetla wa ho boha dinaledi neng ha ba tjhaketse moo ho batang Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Nakong ya mariha**.

The text states: ""Kaha dibaka ha di na baahi ba bangata, le tshilagfalo ya kganya e se bothata bo boholo hakaalo, o tla kgona hape ho thabela dinaledi. **Kaha dibaka tsa Arctic kapa Antarctic di etswetse nakong ya mariha, o tla kgona ho bona Aurora borealis.**"" (Because the places have few inhabitants, and the snow is not a big problem, you will also be able to enjoy the aurora. **Because these places are visited during winter, you can see the Aurora borealis.**)

Therefore, the opportunity to see the aurora, and thus potentially photograph wildlife, is during the winter/summer (depending on the hemisphere) when visiting Antarctica.
"
Ke neng fono ya sathalaete e ke keng ya nka sebaka sa mohala wa thekeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Haeba pono ho ya fihla sathalaeteng e ka sitiseha (If line of sight to the satellite is not available)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph explicitly states: ""Founu ya satellite ka kakaretso ha e nkele selefounu sebaka, kaha o lokela ho ba kantle o bona hantle sathelaete ha o letsa mohala"" (Satellite phone does not completely replace a cell phone, as you need to have a clear view of the satellite to make a call).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Haeba sebaka se le hole (If the location is remote):** While satellite phones *are* used in remote locations, the remoteness itself isn't the *reason* they don't replace cell phones.  The reason is the need for a line of sight.
* **C: Haeba e tla sebediswa kantle (If it will be used indoors):**  Satellite phones generally *cannot* be used indoors because of the need for a clear view of the satellite.
* **D: Ha leeto le na le tlhoko ya data (If the trip requires data):** While satellite phones *can* provide data, the main reason they don't replace cell phones is the line of sight requirement for voice calls.  Data is a secondary function.



"
Fono ya sathalaete e hlokahala ho feta selefono neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Leetong la sekepe**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that satellite phones are often used by people working in remote areas, including those on ships (""ba rwalang dithoto, ho akarelletsa dikepe tse sebedisetswang boithabiso""). 
* Ships are inherently remote locations with no cellular service. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nakong eo o ileng phomolong toropong:** In a city slum, you might have limited or no cellular service, but a satellite phone isn't necessarily *more* necessary than a regular phone (though it would be a backup).
* **C: Ha data ya ho le e sa hlokahale:**  Satellite phones are useful even when data isn't needed, as they provide voice communication in areas with no cellular coverage.
* **D: Ha o ka etsahala o fumane kgokahano e lekaneng ya mohala wa thekeng:** If cellular coverage is available, a regular phone is generally more convenient and cost-effective than a satellite phone.



"
Ke qwaketsano ya eng bakileng ho thehwa hwa naha ya Transinistria Republic?,"The correct answer is **B: Morabe**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ka 1994, kgohlano ena e ile ya lebisa ho thehweng ha Repabliki e ipolelang e le Transnistria ka botjhabela ho Moldova, **e nang le mmuso wa yona le tjhelete ya yona empa ha e hlokomelwe ke naha le ha e le efe eo e leng karolo ya UN**."" This clearly indicates a conflict (kgohlano) as the cause of Transnistria's secession.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe eo Transnistria Republic e nang le yona e fapaneng le Moldova yohle?  ","The correct answer is **C: Ho ananelwa ke dinaha tsa matjhaba a kopaneng (Not recognized by the international community)**.

The text states: ""Ka 1994, kgohlano ena e ile ya lebisa ho thehweng ha Repabliki e ipolelang e le Transnistria ka botjhabela ho Moldova, e nang le mmuso wa yona le tjhelete ya yona empa ha e hlokomelwe ke naha le ha e le efe eo e leng karolo ya UN."" This means Transnistria is not recognized by the UN or most countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Puo (Language):** The text says Seromania Serussia is widely used throughout Moldova.  It doesn't state that Transnistria uses a different language.
* **B: Tumelo (Religion):** The text states that the main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.  It doesn't mention anything about Transnistria having a different main religion.
* **D: Mofuta wa tjhelete (Currency):** The text says Transnistria has its own currency. This is *true* but the key difference highlighted is lack of international recognition, which is a more significant distinction.

"Ho latela seratswana, baeti ba lokela ho tjhakela sebaka sa Montevidio neng ha ba sa rate moya o mongata?","The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya dikgweli tsa mariha ka leboya**.

The passage states: ""Montevideo e hare ha dinaha tse tjhesang; ka dikgwedi tsa lehlabula, dithempereitjhara tse fetang +30°C di tlwaelehile. Mariha a ka bata haholo: dithempereitjhara ha dia tlwaela ho feta tlaase ha ntlha ya kgwamo, empa moya le mongobo dia kopana ho etsa hore ho bate ho feta kamoo thermometer e bolelang kateng."" This indicates that the rainy season is when the weather is humid and hot.  Therefore, if someone doesn't want humid weather, they should avoid visiting during the rainy season.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Montevideo e hare ha dinaha tse tjhesang; ka dikgwedi tsa lehlabula, dithempereitjhara tse fetang +30°C di tlwaelehile."" (Montevideo is in a subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures exceeding +30°C are typical.)

The question asks when a tourist interested in the warmest weather should visit.  Summer is the warmest time of year. Options B, C, and D refer to other weather conditions (spring, rainfall, and the rainy season) which are not the warmest."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe ho tse latelang e ka amahangwang le ssa mengolo se molaongkgahlanong le tshenyo?","The correct answer is **C: Boitshwaro bo sa hlokahaleng thepeng ya setjhaba (Unauthorized use of public property)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that graffiti artists are increasingly seen as artists rather than just vandals. It also mentions ""diketsahalo tsa graffiti"" (graffiti incidents) and ""mabota a 'molaong'"" (legal graffiti). The core issue discussed is the act of writing or drawing on public property without permission.

* **A: Diketsahalo tsa botaki ba mengolo (Vandalism incidents)** is too broad. While related, the passage is moving beyond simply vandalism to consider a more nuanced view of graffiti as art.
* **B: Ho ngola (Writing)** is too general. Anyone can write, but it doesn't necessarily relate to illegal graffiti.
* **D: Matshwao a seng molaong (Illegal acts)** is also too broad.  While illegal graffiti *is* an illegal act, the passage focuses on the specific act of using public property without permission.

Therefore, **C: Boitshwaro bo sa hlokahaleng thepeng ya setjhaba** most accurately captures the central theme of the passage regarding graffiti and its legality.
"
Ke dikarolo dife tsa mekete ya dipina tseo batho ba nkang di le bohlokwa?,"The best answer is **D: Ho fihla ka nako**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of arriving early to secure a camping spot close to the music.** This is directly stated: ""Haeba o batla ho bona se etsahalang o le haufi o tshwanetse hore o fihle kapele hore o fumane sebaka sa ho kampa se haufi le mmino."" (If you want to see what's happening, you should arrive early to get a camping spot close to the music.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ho tlisa bana ba banyane (Bringing young children):** While relevant for some, it's not the *most* crucial aspect emphasized by the passage. The passage mentions dedicated camping areas for families, but doesn't frame it as a general key element.
* **B: Ho khempa sebakeng seo (Securing a spot):** This is a *result* of arriving early, not a core element in itself.  The early arrival is the action, the secure spot is the outcome.
* **C: Mmino o llang bosiu haholo (The music playing late at night):** The passage acknowledges the music playing late, but it's not the *most* important thing people prioritize when planning to attend. It's a feature, not a fundamental requirement.



Therefore, arriving early is the action that enables attendees to enjoy the market effectively, making **D** the correct answer.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, motho a yang moketeng wa dipina o moholo o lokela ho sheba eng haholoholo haeba o batla ho khempa pela moo ho binelwang?","The correct answer is **C: Ho khempa ka thokwana ho sebaka seo (To look for a spot quickly there)**.

Here's why:

* The first paragraph states that people rush to secure a camping spot quickly at music markets.
* The question asks what a large, experienced festival-goer should do to find a spot.
* Therefore, the most logical action is to look for an available spot promptly.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ho fihla bosiu haholo (To arrive very late)** - Arriving late means most of the good spots will be taken.
* **B: Ho dula dibakeng tsa malapa (To stay in family areas)** - This is only relevant if you have children.
* **D: Ho fihla ka nako (To arrive on time)** - While arriving early is helpful, the text emphasizes the *speed* needed to secure a spot.

"Ho latela seratswana, baeti ba lokela ho qoba eng ha ba batla ho ya menateng ya bosiu ka leboya ho New Mexico?","The correct answer is **A: Pueblos**.

The text specifically mentions that New Mexico has many issues with intoxicated people, and that smaller town bars near towns are often heavily populated with them. This implies that Pueblos (which are often associated with cultural sites and potentially tourist areas) would be a place to avoid for a safe nightlife experience.

This indicates casinos near Santa Fe are likely to have more upscale entertainment.
* **The passage also cautions:** ""Hlokomela: dibare tsa ditoropo tse nyenyane mona ha se hangata e le dibaka tse ntle bakeng sa moeti ya tswang kantle ya batlang ho phomola."" This rules out local town bars.
* **The passage mentions:** ""New Mexico e ka leboya e na le mathata a mangata ka lebaka la batho ba kganna ba tahilwe, mme bongata ba bakganni ba tahilweng ba tletse haholo dibareng tse nyenyane haufi le ditoropo."" This reinforces that smaller town bars are not ideal.

Therefore, a casino near Santa Fe is the most logical place for an out-of-town visitor seeking quality entertainment, based on the information provided.  The other options are less likely:

* **A: Khasinong, e ka bang dihora tse pedi ho tloha sebakeng sa Albuquerque:** While Albuquerque has casinos, the question asks for a *more upscale* experience, and the passage suggests Santa Fe casinos are more likely to offer that.
* **B: “Pueblo” e hole toropo:** Pueblos are historical and cultural sites, not typically associated with casinos or upscale entertainment.
* **D: Bareng e torotswaneng:**  As mentioned above, local town bars are not recommended.



"
Baeti ba tsitsang bajeteng ya bona ba ka batla ho qoba dino dife?,"The correct answer is **A: Veine ya Austrlia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ho na le di veine tse ngata tsa se Fura tse ka nwewang, empa di veine tsa New Zealand le Australia di ka ba molemo nyana."" (There are many types of tea that can be drunk, but New Zealand and Australian teas can be quite good.)  Therefore, a traveler on a budget might want to buy Australian tea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Metsi a rekiswang** (Bottled water): The passage says tap water is safe and easily available, and bottled water is only for those who are afraid. This suggests it's *not* the most budget-friendly option.
*   **C: Jwala ba lehae** (Home-cooked meals): The passage doesn't mention anything about eating, so this is irrelevant.
*   **D: Terinki ya ditholwana** (Souvenir mug):  This is an unnecessary purchase for someone trying to save money.

Therefore, buying Australian tea is the most logical choice for a budget-conscious traveler based on the provided information.
"
"Ho latela sebaka se hlalositsweng seratswaneng seo, ho tse latelang ke otara efe ya dino e ka ferekanngwang ke mofani wa dino?","The correct answer is **C: Sauvignon Blanc ya New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ho na le di veine tse ngata tsa se Fura tse ka nwewang, empa di veine tsa New Zealand le Australia di ka ba molemo nyana."" This translates to ""There are many types of Fura wine that can be drunk, but the wines of New Zealand and Australia can be quite good."" Sauvignon Blanc is a type of wine commonly associated with New Zealand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Short black:** The passage mentions ""espresso"" and ""flat white,"" but not ""short black.""
* **B: Number One:** The passage describes ""Number One"" as a type of bird, not a drink.
* **D: Flat White:** The passage describes ""flat white"" as a coffee drink, not a type of wine.



"
Taba ya bokolone e nkileng dilemo tse makgolo a mararo e qadilwe ke sehlopha sefe?,"The correct answer is **D: Batho ba Spain**.

The text states: ""Batho ba Spain ba qadile nako ya ho etsa dikoloni e nkileng dilemo tse makgolo a mararo."" (The people of Spain spent a time making colonies that lasted three centuries.)
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mokhwa ofe o motle wa ho etsa motho ya hlahang Paris a o phuthulohele?","The correct answer is **C: Ho bontsha tlhompho (to show respect)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bokantle ba kgalefo batho ba Parisia bo tla nyamela ka potlako haeba o bontsha mekgwa e metle."" This translates to: ""The hearts of Parisians will quickly soften if you show good manners.""  ""Mekgwa e metle"" (good manners) directly relates to respect and politeness.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ho leka ho etsisa boikutlo ba batho ba hlahang Paris (To try to appease the feelings of Parisians):** While being agreeable is helpful, the text focuses on *manners*, not necessarily appeasement.
* **B: Ho bontsha boitshepo (To show pride):**  The text doesn't associate Parisian culture with showing pride.
* **D: Ho bontsha boitswharo ba ho rata ho ba le batho (To show the generosity of liking people):** Again, while being friendly is good, the emphasis is on *manners* (respect).



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e nkuwang e se ya tse ke keng tsa fetolwa ka batho ba hlahang Paris?","The correct answer is **D: Ho se hlomphe (Disrespect)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Parisians value self-control, etiquette, and restraint. It emphasizes that demonstrating good manners will quickly win them over.  Therefore, showing disrespect would be the opposite of what is valued and would *not* be easily forgiven or overcome. The other options – self-control, being polite, and being refined – are all aspects of the ""bien élevé"" attitude that the passage promotes.
"
Molemo wa ho dula boemong ba pele tereneng e mathang ka tlase ho lefatshe Cape town ke ofeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Bodulo ba maemo a hodimo bo qalong ya terene**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that MetroPlus trains, which are faster and cheaper, are located at the *front* of the trains, closer to Cape Town. 
* Therefore, sitting in the front provides a better view.
* The other options are not supported by the text:
    * B: The passage doesn't mention whether the front of the train is less crowded.
    * C:  The size of the seats isn't mentioned.
    * D:  The seat price is not relevant to the location of the seats on the train.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, kaofela diterene tsa basebetsi tsa Cape Town di na le eng?","The correct answer is **B: Ditjeo tse lekanang tsa ditekete ka bobedi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Terene e nngwe le e nngwe e na le ka bobedi materoko a MetroPlus le a Metro..."" which implies that each train has both types of ticket options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sebaka sa maemo a hodimo se nang le batho ba fokolang:** The passage doesn't mention seating arrangements or occupancy levels.
*   **C: Maemo a mararo a fapaneng:** The passage only mentions two types of trains/sections (MetroPlus and Metro).
*   **D: Boemo bo phahameng ba pele le boemo ba boraro:** The passage doesn't specify seating classes.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe eo kokoanyana e ke keng ya e etsa?","The correct answer is **C: Ho jala tshwaetso (To hunt snakes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states bats eat insects, spiders, and some smaller animals.** While bats *might* eat very small snakes occasionally, it's not a typical or common part of their diet. The other options are all things bats *do* eat:
    * **Ho baka makhopho (To catch moths):** Bats are known insectivores and moths are a common food source.
    * **Ho baka botsikinyane (To catch mosquitoes):** Mosquitoes are a frequent part of a bat's diet.
    * **Ho baka maqeba (To catch flies):** Flies are another common insect that bats eat.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that bats are *least likely* to hunt snakes.
"
Dikarete tse nang le moya tsa difono di ka rekwa kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Dinaheng tse itseng** (In certain countries).

Here's why:

* The question describes prepaid phone cards that can be used on both payphones and phones. It also mentions that some cards offer cheaper calls within specific countries. 
* The text implies the availability of these cards is limited to particular countries, not universally accessible.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Diemelong tsa diterene** (Train stations): While possible, train stations aren't the primary place to buy prepaid phone cards.
* **C: Mabenkeleng a manyane hukung ya meaho e meholo** (Small shops in large shopping malls):  This is a possibility, but not the most accurate or common location.
* **D: Difonong tse patallwang tsa setjhaba** (Public phone stores): These stores *might* sell them, but the question doesn't explicitly state it's *only* available there. The emphasis is on country-specific availability.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and best fits the information in the question."
"Ditjeo tse bobebe tse fanwang ke dikarete tse ding, di ka fumaneha jwang?","The correct answer is **B: Dinomorong tse sa lefellweng**.

Here's why:

The question asks where to find free/cheap calls from certain prepaid cards. The text states that free access to these services is often achieved by obtaining a prepaid phone number that can be called from many devices without cost. Therefore, the free calls are associated with the *prepaid phone numbers* themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dinaheng tse itseng** (In certain countries): While the cards might be specific to certain countries, the question is about where to *find* the free calls associated with them, not the locations where the cards are sold.
*   **C: Lebenkeleng le lenyane hukung ya meaho e meholo** (In a small shop in a large shopping mall): This is a possible place to *buy* a card, but not where to *find* the free calls.
*   **D: Ka ho sebedisa fono ya setjhaba e lefellwang le ho lefa ditjeo tse ding hape** (By using a paid public phone and making other calls as well): This describes a method of making calls, but doesn't address where to obtain the free/cheap calls associated with prepaid cards.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho difate tse latelang, ke sefe se sa fumaneheng habobebe setsing sa diphoofolo tse hlaha le dimela sa Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **B: Leoka (Pine)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Plitvice Lakes has beech, spruce, and fir trees. It also lists several animals that can be found there, including lynx and capercaillie. Pine trees are *not* mentioned as being present in the area. Therefore, the answer is pine (leoka).



"
Ke mofuta ofe wa diphoofolo o sa fumaneheng habobebe setsing sa diphoofolo tse hlaha sa Pltitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **C: Cassowary**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that **Capercaillie** can be found in the Plitvice Lakes area.
* The passage explicitly states that **Honey Badger** (bere e sootho ya Europe) can be found in the Plitvice Lakes area.
* The passage explicitly states that **Lynx** can be found in the Plitvice Lakes area.
* **Cassowaries** are native to New Guinea and Australia and are not found in Europe. Therefore, the answer is Cassowary.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, dinomoro tse ikhethang tsa dibaka tsa pele dinomorong tsa mehala di thusa jwang?","The correct answer is **D: Ho kopitsa ho seng molaong (Illegal copying)**.

The provided text explicitly states that the ""real plan"" is to benefit powerful companies in their markets, and this is ""just a money-making scheme."" It then goes on to say that bootleg copies (illegal copies) only play well on the device they were used with, and not on any other device. Therefore, the focus is on facilitating illegal copying of disks.

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

*   **A: Ho kopitsa di disk (Copying disks):** While copying is mentioned, the text frames it as the *result* of the plan, not the plan itself.
*   **B: Taolo ya mebaraka (Market control):** The text suggests the plan is about financial gain, not market control in the traditional sense.
*   **C: Thibelo ya lekunutu (Prevention of piracy):** The text directly contradicts this, stating the plan *enables* illegal copying.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang yeo eseng nnete ka dikhoutu tsa sebaka e tswelliswang pele ke ditsi tsa kgaso?","The correct answer is **D: Ke ka sewelo di thusang thibelong ya lekunutu (They can reasonably help in preventing piracy).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that the stated reason for location tracking is to ""prevent piracy"" but claims this is misleading.** It argues that location tracking doesn't actually stop illegal copying, just limits where a copied disc *might* play.
* **The passage implies the real reason is financial gain for the companies.**
* **Options A, B, and C are all stated or strongly implied as reasons *why* location tracking is being pushed:**
    * **A: Di bohlokwa bakeng sa ho fumana taolo e eketseileng ya di mmaraka (They are important for gaining more control of the market):**  This aligns with the argument that companies want more power in the market.
    * **B: Di thusa ho qoba ho qopitsa ho seng molaong (They help prevent illegal copying):** This is directly contradicted by the passage's main claim.
    * **C: Di thusa ho kenya tjhelete (They help make money):**  This is the core argument of the passage - location tracking is primarily about profit.

Therefore, the only option that's *not* supported by the passage's argument is that location tracking reasonably helps prevent piracy.  The passage argues it doesn't.



"
"Ha o fihla haeno, ke tshebetso efe e etswang ka mokhwa o bobebe?","The correct answer is **A: Ho hlahloba bojaki** (Inspecting goods).

The question describes the difficulty of inspecting incoming goods and the importance of knowing what to expect to meet legal standards. This directly relates to the process of inspecting goods upon arrival. The other options are not directly connected to the scenario described.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng eo o lokelang ho e tseba pele o fihla haeno?","The correct answer is **B: Ha o batla ho phatlalatsa dintho tse rekilweng kantle ho naha ka hodima meedi ya molao.**

Here's why:

* **The question states that inspecting incoming goods can be difficult.** This highlights the importance of understanding regulations *before* arrival.
* **Option B directly addresses the need to understand legal requirements regarding importing goods.**  Knowing how to declare and comply with customs regulations is crucial to avoid problems.
* **Options A, C, and D are consequences, not preventative measures.** While they might be relevant, understanding the legal framework is the *preemptive* step.

Therefore, understanding the legal requirements for declaring imported goods (Option B) is the most important thing to know *before* arrival to ensure smooth customs clearance.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke bongata ba eng bo dumellang bahlwi ba dithaba ho dula ba fuamana ditsela tse ntjha kamehla?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlhoro (Expeditions)**.

The text states: ""Ditlhoro di akareletsa ho sheba dibaka tse tsotehang ho tswa ditlhorong.""  This means expeditions (ditlhoro) are involved in exploring new routes and discovering new spots. This is how climbers continue to find new routes in Cochamó Valley.
"
"Ho ipapisitswe le ditaba tse hlahang seratswaneng, ke khamphani efe e nang le dibaka tsa ho tshela tse ngata ka ho fetisisa Karolo e ka Borwa ya Lefatshe?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states that Star Alliance *does* include flights covering North Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti. It explicitly mentions that Star Alliance is the only alliance that covers a route from North Pacific to the far west of North America. It also says that SkyTeam does *not* include any North Pacific locations.

Therefore, Star Alliance has more destinations in North/South Pacific than SkyTeam does, according to the passage.
"
Ke bafufisi ba selekane sefe ba nkang karolo e nyane ho tsheleng lewatle la Karolo e ka Borwa ya Lefatshe?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Star Alliance e akaretsa ntho engwe le engwe ntle le Pacific Borwa e ka botjhabela ho tloha Santiago de Chile ho ya Tahiti, eo e leng leeto la sefofane la LATAM Oneworld.""  This directly indicates that Star Alliance has a significant role in North Pacific air travel.
* The passage mentions LATAM Oneworld as *one* option for traveling to the North Pacific, not the overall role of airlines in the region.
* SkyTeam is mentioned as *not* encompassing all three major oceanic regions.
* South Pacific is a *region*, not an airline alliance.



Therefore, Star Alliance is the alliance mentioned as having a substantial presence in the North Pacific.
"
Ke mokgatlo ofe wa maeto o atlehileng ho Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **A: Running Copenhagen**.

The text states that Global Running Tours includes Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona, Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, and Running Tours Prague, among others.  The question asks for a successful tour organization within Global Running Tours, and Running Copenhagen is listed as one. While Go Running Tours is the overarching company, Running Copenhagen is a specific and mentioned tour.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, Go running Tours e thusa ho kopanya mekgatlo e mekae e thusang ho felehetsa baeti le ho ruta sebaka?","The correct answer is **B: 200**.

The passage states: ""Ho na le ho e ka bang mekgatlo ya bohahlaudi e tsamaiswang e 200."" which translates to ""There are approximately 200 online organizations.""
"
Bahahlaudi ba lokela ho etsa eng ha ba batla ho bonela lengau haufi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho sebedisa koloi o nkile disebediswa tse tlwaelehileng.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Diphoofolo tse ding, jwaloka ditlou le dithuhlo, di tlwaetse ho atamela haufi le dikoloi mme disebediswa tse tlwaelehileng di ka etsa hore o di bone hantle."" (Other animals, such as elephants and rhinos, are used to approaching cars and common equipment can help you see them better.)

Therefore, using a vehicle with common equipment is the best way to see animals up close, according to the passage.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa phoofolo oo moeti a ka kopanang le ona habobebe ha a tsamaya ka koloi?","The correct answer is **A: Ditau**.

The text states: ""Diphoofolo tse ding, jwaloka ditlou le dithuhlo, di tlwaetse ho atamela haufi le dikoloi mme disebediswa tse tlwaelehileng di ka etsa hore o di bone hantle."" (Other animals, such as elephants and rhinos, are used to approaching cars and usual equipment can help you see them better.) Therefore, tourists are likely to encounter elephants while on a safari by car.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka fokotsang ditshenyehelo tsa leeto?","The correct answer is **B: Ho fumana sehlopha sa batho ba bane se o tsamayang le sona.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Maeto ha a bitse haholo bakeng sa dihlopha tse kgolo, kahoo haeba o le mong kapa o na le motswalle a le mong, leka ho kopana le batho ba bang mme le etse sehlopha sa batho ba e ka bang ba nne kapa ba tsheletseng bakeng sa theko e molemonyana ya motho ka bomong."" This means traveling in a group of four or more is more economical.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho tsamaya o le mong:** The passage says travel is *more* expensive when traveling alone.
* **C: Ho ya le motho e mong:** This is also more expensive than traveling in a group.
* **D: Ho fumana sehlopha sa batho ba tsheletseng kapa ho feta:**  While traveling with a larger group is good, the passage specifically mentions a group of *four*.  A group of ""more"" than four isn't the primary solution mentioned.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya ka fumanang ditjeo hantle ka ho fitisisa tsa maeto a bohahlaudi?","The correct answer is **A: Bahahlaudi ba fapanyetsanang ka makoloi (Passengers travelling separately in the same plane)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ho bonahala hantle-ntle e le tsela ya ho qhekanyetsa batho hore ba tshepe hore ba tshwanetse ho lefa ho eketsehileng. **Hangata bahahlaudi ba bangata ba tsamaiswa hohle hore ho tlatswe dikoloi.**"" This indicates that airlines often fill planes with passengers travelling individually.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Sehlopha sa batho ba bararo (A group of three people)** - The text suggests groups of four are ideal for cost savings.
*   **C: Metswalle e mmedi e etang mmoho (Two travelling together)** - This is not mentioned as a preferred or commonly used arrangement.
*   **D: Sehlopha sa batho ba bahlano (A group of five people)** - Similar to B, the text prefers groups of four.

Therefore, the airline filling planes with individual passengers is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e entseng hore sebaka sa St Francisco se tsebahale lefatsheng ka bophara?","The correct answer is **A: Boteng ba mefuta e mengata ya bonono le bophatlalatsi** (Variety of art and culture).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ho bontshiwa ha yona mminong, dibaesekopong, dibukeng le ditsong tse ratwang ho thusitse ho etsa toropo le diemahale tsa yona di tsejwe lefatseng ka bophara.""  This translates to: ""Its display in museums, libraries, books, and popular collections has helped to make the city and its attractions internationally renowned.""  This directly points to the city's cultural offerings as the reason for its global recognition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dibaka tsa dikopano tse boemong bo hodimo** (High-rise conference centers): While San Francisco has these, they are listed as *economic activities*, not the primary reason for its worldwide fame.
* **C: Mefuta e fapaneng ya moruo** (Variety of weather): The text mentions a variety of weather, but it's not presented as a key factor in the city's international recognition.
* **D: Tjhebahalo e khotsofatsang ya dijo tsa batho ba Asia** (Comfortable atmosphere of Asian food):  The text notes the excellent Asian food scene, but it's not stated as the *reason* for global fame. It's just one of many attractions.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e seng nnete ka San Francisco?","The correct answer is **D: Moruo o itshetlehile feela ka bohahlaudi (The weather is only foggy)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that San Francisco's weather is *diverse* and mentions its fame for fog. However, it *doesn't* say the weather is *only* foggy. The text also mentions its strong job market, cultural significance, and diverse Asian cuisine, indicating a broader range of characteristics than just fog.

The other options are all mentioned in the text:

* **A: E hlahelletse hangata dibukeng le dibaesekopong (It is often featured in books and magazines):** This is directly stated.
* **B: Dijo tsa batho ba Asia di atile (Asian foods are available):** This is directly stated.
* **C: Di fumaneha haholo dihoteleng le ditsing tsa kopano (They are mainly found in hotels and conference centers):** This is directly stated.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa baeti o ke keng wa una molemo ditshebeletsong tsa maeto tsa ejente?","The correct answer is **C: Moeti ya so fumane visa (A traveler who cannot obtain a visa)**.

Here's why:

* **Travel agents** often assist with visa applications and ensure travelers have the necessary documentation.  A traveler who cannot obtain a visa would limit the travel agent's ability to facilitate the trip. The agent's services become significantly less valuable in that situation.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Moeti ya hlolwang ho etsa qeto hangata (A traveler who tends to make decisions quickly):** This isn't necessarily a disadvantage.  Travel agents can work with travelers who are decisive and can quickly finalize plans.
* **B: Moeti ya tlwaetseng ho etsa dintho a sa rera (A traveler who tends to do things unprepared):** While a bit challenging, travel agents can help prepare such travelers.  It's a common task.
* **D: Moeti ya ratang ho lefella ditshebeletso tse sehlopha (A traveler who wants to pay for exclusive services):** This is a potential client. Travel agents offer a range of services, including those that can be tailored to clients willing to pay extra for exclusivity.



Therefore, a traveler unable to obtain a visa presents the biggest obstacle to the travel agent's ability to provide useful services.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa bolelwang seratswaneng e le molemo wa ho lefella ho ejente ya maeto?","The correct answer is **A: Ditokomane tsa maeto tse tswang kapele (Emergency travel documents)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the benefits of travel agents providing pre-trip preparations.  It focuses on things like booking hotels, arranging meals, and handling visa issues.  Emergency travel documents are *not* typically something a travel agent would pre-arrange or be responsible for.  They are something a traveler should be prepared to handle themselves in case of an unexpected situation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ditjeo tse bobebe tsa dihoteleng (Hotel room upgrades):** Travel agents *can* often arrange hotel room upgrades as part of their service, especially if they have relationships with hotels.
* **C: Ditshebeletso tsohle e le sehlopha se ditjeo tse bobebe (All services as a package of emergency documents):** This is too broad. While some emergency documents *could* be included, it's not a standard package.
* **D: Ho bolokela motho sebaka (Holding a space for someone):** Travel agents can sometimes hold a space for someone at a hotel or for certain tours.

Therefore, the most ""sa bolelwang seratswaneng e le molemo wa ho lefella ho ejente ya maeto"" (not typically expected to be arranged by a travel agent) is emergency travel documents.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sefe seo mananeo a ho fetolela mantswe puong e nngwe a sitwang ho se etsa?","The correct answer is **B: Ho fetolela polelo yohle puong e nngwe**.

The passage states: ""Mananeo a nang le bokgoni ba ho fetolela ka ho iketsahallang dikgeo tsohle tsa mongolo ho tloha puong e nngwe ho ya ho e nngwe."" This translates to: ""Applications that have the ability to automatically translate all written text from one language to another.""
"
Ke eng e thusang hore puo e fetolelwe ka thoko ho marang-rang?,"The correct answer is **D: Mananeo a ho fetolela puo tsa mokhahlelo wa real-time**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mananeo a ho fetolela...a kgona le ho fetolela mengolo ho dipuo disele e le matshwao kapa disebediswa tse ding tse teng lefatseng ha motho a supisa smartphone ho disebediswa tseo."" This refers to real-time language translation apps.
* **Options A, B, and C are less specific:** While ""Lintho tsa morao-rao tse fetolelang puo"" (Recent language translation tools) is a broad statement, and ""Mehala ya thekeng ya mora-rao"" (Recent technological advancements) is even broader, they don't pinpoint the *mechanism* of translation. ""Ho taolouta teitha ya puo"" (Using a language database) is a part of the process, but not the core of real-time translation.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and specific answer based on the provided text."
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa bakeng mophula wa lehlwa?","The correct answer is **A: Lehlwa le itswarellang (A rolling hill)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that unusual things can cause the hills to roll, but *a rolling hill itself* is *not* a cause of the problem. The problem is that the hill *rolls* and needs to be stabilized. The other options are described as *causes* of the rolling:

*   **B: Batho (People)** are mentioned as a potential cause.
*   **C: Khanya ya letsatsi (Sunlight)** is mentioned as a potential cause.
*   **D: Ho khethea hwa lehlwa hodima le leng (Differential heating of the hill)** is mentioned as a potential cause.

Therefore, a rolling hill is the *effect*, not the cause, and is the correct answer."
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe eo e leng mophula wa lehlwa?","The correct answer is **A: Lehlwa le itshwarellang le sa phunyeletswa** (A tree that grows irregularly and is not pruned).

Here's why:

The passage describes unusual tree growth where the top branches grow upwards only, and the lower parts become sparse. It also mentions that the tree is growing unusually and needs to be pruned to encourage downward growth.  The passage explicitly states that these unusual growths are caused by factors like a hot sun, another tree, or human intervention.  The key is the *irregular and unpruned growth*.  Option A best captures this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Meepa e tibileng e se nang lehlwa** (Dead branches without leaves): The passage is about living trees, not dead branches.
* **C: Lehlwa le le ngata meepeng e tibileng** (A tree with many dead branches):  While dead branches *could* contribute to unusual growth in some circumstances, the passage doesn't focus on dead branches.
* **D: Lehlwa le sa thetswang ke batho** (A tree not pruned by humans): The passage *explicitly mentions* human intervention as a potential cause of the unusual growth.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, sopho e etsoa ka dintho life?","The correct answer is **A: Yokate le metsi (Cow dung and water)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sejo sa k’heri ke sejo se entsweng ka ditlama le dinoko, hammoho le nama kapa meroho. K’heri e ka nna ya e ba “e omileng” kapa “e metsi” ho itshetlehile ka tekanyo ya mokedi-kedi."" This means cow dung and water are the main ingredients. While meat and blood *can* be added, the base is dung and water.  The question asks what it is *made of* according to the text, and cow dung and water are listed first and as the base. Options C and D are incorrect as they include ingredients that are optional additions, not the primary components. Option B is incomplete as it omits the water."
"Dibakeng tse ding, lebese la khokhonte le ka sebeliswa ho sebakeng sa ntho efe e etsang sopho?","The correct answer is **A: Nama**.

The text states that in some places (like parts of India and Pakistan), a *kheri* (a type of bowl) is commonly used with meat or *nama* (meat). 

The text also mentions that coconut shells are used in some other places, but doesn't specify what they are used *with*. Therefore, the answer that aligns with the information given is meat.
"
Hobaneng tsela e potolohang Dithaba tsa Transantarctic e lokela ho fihla sehlabeng?,"The correct answer is **B: Lehlwa le bokellaneng le kotsi** (A dangerous pass).

Here's why:

The passage states the South Pole Traverse needs to take a route that avoids the Transantarctic Mountains and then reaches the continent. Because the traverse is done by specialized tracked vehicles, it must take a *dangerous pass* through the mountains to avoid the more difficult terrain. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seteishene sa McMurdo se dula se kwetswe hangata** (McMurdo Station is frequently blocked) - This is irrelevant to the route through the Transantarctic Mountains.
*   **C: Diterekere tse etseditsweng hona ha di hlwahlwa** (The tracked vehicles are not approved) - The passage explicitly states that specialized tracked vehicles *are* used.
*   **D: Ho bobebe ho feta ho tsamaya le lewatleng la Ross** (It's easier to travel along the Ross Sea) - The passage implies avoiding the Ross Sea route, stating the route should take a ""setelele"" (high) path to cross the mountains.

"
"Tseleng ya South Pole Traverse, ke eng e tshwauweng ka difolakha?","The correct answer is **C: Di “crevasse” tse tletseng lehlwa (Crevasses filled with ice)**.

The passage states: ""It is completely covered with packed snow and secured with **ice crevasses**.""
"
Ke se fe se sa bolelwang seratswaneng seo bahahlaudi ba lokelang ho se ela hloko ha ba ntse ba ithuta dibaka hlwahlweng e ka Borwa ho Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditjhaba tse fapaneng di na le dipehelo tse fapananeng tsa visa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Afrika e Borwa e se na merusu ha se dinaha tsohle tsa baahisani tse leng jwalo. Ditlhokahalo tsa visa le ditshenyehelo di fapana ho ya ka dinaha mme ho amuwa ke naha eo o tswang ho yona."" This directly addresses the visa requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho tsamaya ka koloi ke mokhwa o motle wa ho tsamaya tseleng e sa tlwaelehang:** While the passage *does* say this, it's a general statement about road trips and not something travellers *need to be particularly cautious of* while learning the routes.
* **C: Boholo ba dinaha hlwahlweng e ka Borwa ho Afrika ha di na dintwa le merusu:** The passage explicitly *contradicts* this, stating that not all countries have them.
* **D: Koloi ya 4x4 ke yona e khothalletswang ha motho a tsamaya ka koloi:**  The passage *suggests* a 4x4 is recommended, but it doesn't say it's a critical thing travellers *need to be cautious of* while learning routes.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng se ka nkuwang e le keletso e fosahetseng ho bahahlaudi ba etelang hlwahlwa e ka Borwa ho Afrika?","The correct answer is **D: Hase dinaha tsohle tsa Afrika e Borwa tse hantle sebakeng sa ho tjhakelwa.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho amuwa ke naha eo o tswang ho yona. Ditslhokahalo tsa visa le ditshenyehelo di fapana ho ya ka dinaha mme ha se dinaha tsohle tsa Afrika e Borwa tse hantle sebakeng sa ho tjhakelwa."" (Visas and costs vary depending on the country, and not all countries in South Africa are equally suitable for traveling.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dintho tse ding tse ka thusang nakong ya tsietsi ka koloing di ya hlokahala ho latela molao** - While car safety is important, the passage focuses more on the varying suitability of countries, not general car safety regulations.
*   **B: Le ha koloi ya 4x4 e khothalletswa, dibaka tse ngata di ntse di fihleleha ka dikoloi tse tlwaehileng** - The passage *does* say that many places are accessible by regular cars, so this statement is accurate, not a ""foolish piece of advice.""
*   **C: Ho tsamaya ka koloi ho hantle bakeng sa batho ba ratang ho kheloha tsela e tlwaehileng** - While road trips offer a unique experience, the main point is about the varying suitability of countries for travel, not just for those seeking a different way to travel.

Therefore, option D directly reflects a key point made in the passage and represents advice that isn't ""foolish.""
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa bolelwang e ka ba kotsi ya ho siya mekotla ho se motho ya e shebileng?","The correct answer is **B: O ka ba motsamaisi wa dithethefatsi o sa tsebe (You could be an unwitting informant).**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically warns about being used as an informant without your knowledge, especially when traveling abroad.  This aligns perfectly with option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: E ka nna ya utsuwa (It could be stolen):** While theft is a risk, the passage focuses on the *legal and political* risks of carrying illegal substances. Theft is a separate concern.
* **C: Mekotla e ka fapanngwa le ya motho e mong (The drugs could be different from someone else's):**  This is a possible concern, but the core issue isn't the substance's identity, it's the *legal ramifications* of possessing it.
* **D: Ba boholong ba ka nka e le tshoso ya bomo (Authorities could consider it a threat to public safety):**  This is also a general risk, but the passage highlights the risk of *being used* by others, not just the authorities' general reaction to drugs.



Therefore, option B is the most direct and accurate answer based on the passage's warning.
"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang ka hara seratswana mabapi le ho tsamaya ka lithethefatsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Dinaheng tse ling, batho ba qalang ho tlola molao ba ka ahlolelwa lefu**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Dinaheng tse ding di na le ditsela tsa ho otla tse sehloho haholo bakeng sa ba qalang ho tlola molao; tsela ena di ka akarelletsa dikahlolo tsa tjhankane tsa dilemo tse fetang 10 kapa lefu."" (In other countries, there are very strict ways to obtain a driver's license for beginners; this can include significant fines or even imprisonment).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho ba sedi ho hlwahlwa ha motho a etela mafatsheng a mang** (It's shameful for someone to visit other countries if they are a woman) - This is not mentioned or implied in the passage.
* **C: Dintja tse nkhellang dithethefatsi di ka sebediswa motho a sa elellwe** (Animals that guide are used by someone who is not trained) - The passage warns that untrained individuals might misuse the driver's license and that the license can be taken if not cared for.
* **D: Ba boholong ba ka nna ba nka mekotla ya hao le ha o sa nka dithethefatsi** (The elderly might take your license if you don't take care of it) -  While the passage mentions the license can be taken if not cared for, it doesn't specifically state the elderly will be the ones to do it.



"
Ke mofuta ofe wa dino o sa bolelwang oo motho a ka iketsetsang ona boikhathollong ba hae ba lehae?,"The correct answer is **A: Terenki**.

The passage specifically mentions making juice or combining herbs, and then gives the example of making **terenki** (a type of herbal drink) as something easy to make at home. The passage also contrasts this with going to bars or restaurants, implying it's something easily made at home, hence a ""hidden"" or less common drink to prepare.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke sebaka sefe se o lokelang ho se etela boikhathollong ba hao ba lehae haeba toropo ya heno e tsebahala haholo ka ho nwa?","The correct answer is **B: Dibaka tse rekisang terinki kapa smoothie**.

Here's why:

* The passage mentions that in a town known for drinking, there are many places to drink.
* The passage also suggests making juice or herbal tea when feeling unwell.
* Drink shops (terinki kapa smoothie places) offer a variety of beverages, including those that can be soothing when feeling under the weather.

The other options are less likely:

* **A: Dibaka tsa ho nwella kofi tse ka thoko ho moo o dulang:** While coffee is mentioned, the passage suggests something more soothing than coffee for feeling unwell.
* **C: Dibara tseo o sa di tlwaelang:** The passage explicitly states avoiding those places.
* **D: Dibaka tsa ho jela tse rekisang tee ya chamomile:** While chamomile tea is mentioned, the passage focuses on general beverages that can be helpful when feeling unwell, not just tea.

Therefore, a place that sells juices or smoothies is the most logical choice based on the passage."
Ditswantsho tse betlwilweng tsa maeba di hokae?,"The correct answer is **A: Halofo ya hora ho tloha motseng**.

The text says: ""Ka lebaleng la kereke, ho na le dintshwantsho tse thahasellisang tsa mmabole tsa maeba hodimo ha mabitla a mang."" This translates to: ""Behind the church, there are interesting stone carvings above some of the graves."" It also states ""ho nka halofo ya hora ho tsamaya-tsamaya motseng ona o thahasellisang."" which translates to: ""It takes half an hour to walk around the interesting village."" Therefore, the carvings are found **half an hour from the village**.
"
Ke mofuta ofe wa visa o ka hlokang hore motho a fane ka bopaki ba tshehetso e lekaneng ya ditjhelete?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ya baithuti (Student Visa)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ditshebetso tsa ho ngodisa ho tloha ho mohahlaudi ya tlwaelehileng kapa **divisa tsa kgwebo**. Dinaheng tse ngata, o tla hloka lengolo la ho amohelwa ho tswa sebakeng seo o labalabelang ho ithuta ho sona, le bopaki ba tjhelete ba hore o tla tla kgona ho itjara bonyane selemo sa ho qala sa ho ithuta.""

This refers to student visas, which commonly require proof of sufficient funds to cover tuition and living expenses. While business visas *can* require proof of funds, the passage focuses on the context of studying abroad.  ""Visa ya nakwana"" (temporary visa) isn't a specific visa type mentioned in the passage.



"
Ke mamg ya ka bang monyetleng wa ho ekeletswa visa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mohahlaudi wa mehla le mehla (Daily worker)**.

Here's why:

The text states that students typically need a visa to stay longer than a certain period.  A daily worker is the one most likely to fall under a category where visa requirements might be waived or are simpler, especially for short-term stays. The other options (expert, student, business professional) are more likely to require a visa, especially for longer stays related to their profession or studies.
"
O lokela ho ela menwang hloko haholo neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya kgwedi tsa lehlabula**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that you need to be especially careful about ticks during the spring (kgwedi tsa lehlabula).  Ticks are more active and prevalent during this season.

The other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ha o hlwa dithaba:** While ticks can be found on mountains, the passage doesn't specifically link mountain climbing to an increased risk.
* **C: Morung e mongobo:**  The passage mentions ticks in wooded areas, but doesn't say that *only* wooded areas are a risk.
* **D: Ha o kganna:**  The passage states that ticks can enter a car when you're inside, meaning you don't necessarily have to be actively walking or ""kganna"" (walking/hiking) to get bitten.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng seo o lokelang ho qoba ho se etsa e le ho qoba menwang ka dibakeng tsa meru e mongobo ha o khanna?","The correct answer is **A: Ho tlohela mamati a koloi a butswe nako e telele haholo** (Leave the car windows open for a long time).

Here's why:

* The question states that when you drive in a humid, swampy area, it's crucial to ventilate the car to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.
* Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can build up inside a closed car.
* Option A directly addresses this by suggesting leaving the windows open for an extended period to allow fresh air to circulate and dilute the CO.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho kganna nakong ya lehlabula** (Ventilate during the drive): While ventilation is important, simply cracking the windows isn't sufficient.  The air needs to be replaced.
* **C: Ho kganna dibakeng tse tjhesang haholo** (Ventilate in very humid places):  The humidity itself isn't the primary problem; it's the potential for trapped, stale air containing carbon monoxide.
* **D: Ho tlohela koloi e sa lebelwa nakong yeo o ntseng o hlwa dithaba** (Leave the car unexpectedly while hiking): This is dangerous and doesn't address the immediate risk of carbon monoxide poisoning during the drive.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e seng ya nnete ka sebaka sa Sundarbans?","The correct answer is **C: Ke moru o moholo ka ho fetisisa lefatsheng** (It is the largest forest in the world).

Here's why:

* The text states that Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², with roughly one-third being wetlands. While large, this doesn't make it the largest forest in the world. Other forests like the Amazon rainforest and the Taiga are significantly larger.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the text:

* **A: Se na le meru e meholo e seng mekae e setseng** (It has some of the rarest endemics): The text mentions that Sundarbans includes rare endemic species, including the Royal Bengal Tiger.
* **B: Kakaretso ya halofo ya sona e kwahetswe ke mohlwa moo ho dulang ho na le metsi** (Approximately half of it is covered by wetlands): The text explicitly states that about one-third is wetlands.
* **D: Ke lehae la dikgama tse matheba ho feta nkwe ya Bengal** (It is the habitat for more tigers than any other part of Bengal): The text mentions that there are around 400 Royal Bengal Tigers in the area.



"
Ke karolo efe ya moru e ka hara sebaka sa MaIndia?,"The correct answer is **B: Sebaka sa polokeho ya diphoofolo tse hlaha le dimela (Protected area for wildlife and plants)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Disundarban di bile tshireletseho ya diphoofolo tsa naha"" (Sundarbans became a protected area for wildlife).
* It also mentions that the Sundarbans are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which often signifies the protection of both wildlife and natural landscapes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sebaka sa poloko ya diphoofolo tse hlaha sa Sundarbans (Sundarbans wildlife heritage site):** While the Sundarbans *have* a significant wildlife heritage, the text emphasizes its *protected* status.
* **C: Dibaka tsa botjhaba tsa lefatshe (Global natural wonders):**  While it *is* a global natural wonder, this doesn't describe its primary function.
* **D: Thota e kgolohadi (Healthy forest):**  The text mentions mangrove forests, but also the protected status and the wildlife. ""Healthy forest"" is too general.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya ka bang monyetleng wa ho ba le kutlwisiso e fokolang ya Senyesemane?","The correct answer is **A: Batho ba ka buang bonyane puo tse pedi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many people in Toronto speak various languages. While many are proficient in English, some may only speak a few languages. Option A directly addresses this possibility.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Batho ba banyenyane dilemong:** The passage doesn't specifically link age to limited English proficiency. It states that older people are more likely to have a better grasp of English.
*   **C: Batho ba etelang Toronto:** The passage mentions people from diverse backgrounds in Toronto, but it doesn't imply that *all* visitors have limited English proficiency.
*   **D: Batho ba baholo:** As mentioned above, the passage implies that older people are *more likely* to have a better grasp of English, not less.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka bang thata ho bitseha?","The correct answer is **B: Diaterese**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sena ke nnete haholo ka diaterese, tseo ho leng boima ho di bitsa hantle."" (This is especially true of dialects, which are difficult to name properly.)

Therefore, the passage indicates that dialects are difficult to name properly.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke maemo afe a loketseng moeti ya rerang ho palama bese seteisheneng sa ditereke?","The correct answer is **A: Moeti ya lebang Jakar a se a rekile tekete pele.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Jwalokaha dibese tse bohareng ba ditereke tse pedi hanata di dula di tletse, ho kgothalletswa ho reka tekete matsatsi a mmalwa esale pele."" (Because buses inside both trains are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.)
* It also says the buses from Jakar/Bumthang usually depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
* Therefore, if someone is traveling from Jakar and wants to ensure they get a seat, they should buy their ticket in advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moeti ya lebang Bumthang a tlameha ho tsamaya ka ya 7** - The text doesn't give any specific travel times for those leaving Bumthang.
* **C: Moeti ya lebang Paro a tlameha ho tsamaya ka mora 11** - The text mentions Paro (Nu 150) but doesn't specify a required departure time after 11:00.
* **D: Moeti ya lebang botjhabela a fihla seteisheneng pele ho 6:20** -  The text states that buses from botjhabela depart between 06:30 and 07:30, not that someone needs to arrive at the station before 6:20.



"
Ke eng e ka bang keletso e ntle ho mohahlaudi ya shebileng ho etela botjhabela a tloha seteisheneng sa dibese tsa setereke?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho reka tekete pele ho nako ya leeto.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Jwalokaha dibese tse bohareng ba ditereke tse pedi hanata di dula di tletse, ho kgothalletswa ho reka tekete matsatsi a mmalwa esale pele."" (Because the buses inside the two-story buses are always full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dibese di tsamaya feela ka mora 8:30:** The text says buses often leave between 06:30 and 07:30, contradicting this statement.
* **C: Dibese tse ngata di tsamaya letsatsi lohle:** The text says buses *often* leave between 06:30 and 07:30, implying they don't run all day.
* **D: Tekesi e kopanetsweng e ka nna ya ba mokhwa o nepahetseng ka ho fetisisa wa ho tsamaya:** While the text mentions combined tickets are a quick way to travel to nearby places, it doesn't say they're the *most* suitable option for traveling to Paro or Punakha.  Buying tickets in advance is the more directly supported recommendation.



"
Ho tse latelang ke eng e sa hlaloseng ka nepo tlhaloso ya Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **B: E hlasetswe ke bofutsana (It was attacked by bandits)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Timbuktu is difficult to reach.
*   The passage mentions the city's historical significance and its importance to the African world.
*   The passage mentions that it was designated in 1990 as a World Heritage site due to the threat of **terrorist** attacks. 

The passage doesn't mention bandit attacks, and is focused on the challenges of reaching the city and its historical status. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E na le tshusumetso e ngata ya Maarabo ho feta dibaka tsohle kahara naha (It has a strong Arab influence than any other place in the country)** - The passage directly states this.
*   **C: Ha e fihlellehe ka sefofane (It is not accessible by plane)** - The passage directly states this.
*   **D: E hohela bahahlaudi ba ratang ho ithuta dibaka tse ntjha (It welcomes tourists who want to learn about new places)** - The passage mentions that Timbuktu was featured on Henry Louis Gates' show, implying it welcomes visitors.



"
Ke ntlha efe e nepahetseng ka Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: E na le bokgabane bo fokolang ba Seafrika ho feta ditoropo tse e potileng.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Toropo e fapane ka ho feletseng le ditoropo tsa mahaeng, hobane e tletse mekgwa ya Maarabia haholo ho feta ya Afrika."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Toropo e fihlellehang ka sefofane:** The passage says it's *not* easy to reach, implying it's not easily accessible by sea.
* **B: Ha e a tlwaeleha ho feta ho futsaneha:** The passage states Timbuktu is a ""toropo e futsanehileng"" (a historic town).
* **D: Toropo ha e sa kgahla bahahlaudi:** The passage says, ""le hoja botumo ba yona bo e etsa e ratwe ke bahahlaudi"" (even though its fame makes it loved by tourists).



"
Diolimpiki tsa hlabula di ne di behetswe ho ba neng? ,"The correct answer is **A: Phato selemong sa 2021**.

The text clearly states: ""Diparalimpiki di tla etsahala ho tloha ka 24 August ho ya ho 5 September 2021."" (The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021.)
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke boemong bofe boo fanele e bang lehodiotswana?","The correct answer is **B: Ha meya e theosang e qalella ho bidika**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the stages of a tornado. Option B accurately reflects the beginning of a tornado's formation: ""It starts as rotating funnel clouds rising from the base of the cloud."" The other options describe later stages:

*   **A:** This describes the wind speed of a strong tornado, not the initial formation.
*   **C:** The passage explicitly states it starts from the base of a cloud.
*   **D:** This describes the tornado's dissipation, not its initial formation.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e nepahetseng ka tshobotsi ya lehodiotswana?","The correct answer is **A: Le dula le fehla meya e pakeng tsa dimaele tse 100-200 ka hora.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Se baka meya e hodimo (hangata 100-200 ya dimaele/ka hora)...""  This directly corresponds to option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hangata le tsamaya le dintho tse boima:** The passage says it *can* lift heavy objects, but it's not a constant characteristic.  The lifting happens *as* the wind gets stronger.
* **C: Le fetoha fanele ka mora ho fihla fatshe:** The passage describes the *process* of the wind becoming stronger and forming stronger gusts, but doesn't say it changes after reaching the ground.
* **D: Di spinning column tse suthumelletsag moya kantle:** The passage describes a wind, not a machine with spinning columns.

Therefore, the only statement directly and accurately supported by the text is that the wind often reaches speeds between 100-200 miles per hour."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke hokae moo moeti a lokelang ho fumana keletso mabapi le maemo a sepolotiki teropong a yang ho yona?","The correct answer is **A: Mmusong wa naha eo a tle be a e etetse (In the embassy of the country he/she is traveling to).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Baahi ba Amerika bo Hare bo ka lebana le maemo a fapa-fapaneng ho tswa ho batho ba Europe le Maarabia.""  This highlights that political situations vary by country.
* It also says, ""Dipono tse ngotsweng hangata ke mohwalotso feela, di tlwaelehile mme di nolofaditswe haholo ha di bapiswa le boitsebiso bo hlalositsweng haholo bo fumanehang sebakeng se seng."" This suggests relying on firsthand information.
* Therefore, the most reliable source of information about a country's political climate is the embassy of that country, located within the country itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maikutlong a fanweng ke ditsebi tsa ditaba tsa maeto (Information provided by travel news experts):** While travel experts can offer insights, their information may not be as current or specific as what's available from the embassy.
* **C: Ho baahi ba naha eo a tle be a e etetse (From citizens of the country he/she is traveling to):**  While citizens *might* have information, it's not a reliable or official source.
* **D: Mmusong wa naha ya habo (In the embassy of his/her home country):**  The embassy of the traveler's home country will primarily focus on assisting their citizens with consular matters, not on providing detailed political analysis of the country they are visiting.



"
"Maemong ao moeti a eleditsweng ke ditsebi tsa ditaba tsa maeto, ke mathata afe ao moeti a hlahang kantle a ke keng a kopana le ona?","The correct answer is **D: Tlhahisoleseding e hlakileng mabapi le maemo a dipolotiki a naha (Clear information about the political situation of a country)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that advice from travel experts is often based on the political situation of a country.  It also highlights a problem: advice is often generalized and doesn't account for the specific experiences of different nationalities.  

Therefore, the passage implies that a lack of **clear and specific information** about a country's political situation is a problem with the advice travel experts offer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dienshorense tse hlakotsweng (Generalized insurance)** - The passage mentions that travel insurance *can* be affected by the political situation, so generalized insurance is not necessarily a problem.
* **B: Ditaba tse ngotsweng eka li bobebe mabapi le maemo a dipolotiki a naha (Inaccurate news about the political situation of a country)** - The passage talks about advice being *generalized*, not necessarily about inaccurate news.
* **C: Inshorense ya bophelo bo botle (Health insurance)** - The passage focuses on *travel* insurance and the political situation. Health insurance isn't directly addressed.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mofuta ofe wa leeto o monyetleng o tlase haholo wa ho batla thuso ya ho lefella leeto, ho ejente ea maeto?","The correct answer is **A: Leeto la ho ya sebokeng sa ditaba tsa mosebetsi toropong eo moeti a seng ile a e etela pele.**

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are *most helpful* for trips that are new or complex.  Option A, a business trip to a city the person has never visited, fits this description perfectly. It's a new and potentially logistically challenging trip.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Leeto la dibeke tse pedi ka bajete e itseng:** While a travel agent *could* assist, budget trips are often more easily planned independently.
*   **C: Leeto le tla tlisa ho se utlwane ka puo:** A travel agent could be helpful, but not necessarily the *most* likely to be sought. The person might find language learning resources or independent travel guides more useful.
*   **D: Leeto la moeti la pele la ho ya mose ho mawatle:** This is a significant trip, but perhaps less complex than a new business trip. Also, a travel agent might be less necessary for someone who has experience with international travel.

Therefore, the business trip to an unfamiliar city best aligns with the advice given in the passage.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke maemong afe ao moeti a ka unang molemo ha a thuswa ke ejente ya ditaba tsa maeto?","The correct answer is **B: Ha moeti a na le thahasello ya leeto la boithabiso ka sehlopha lekgetlo la pele.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that travel agents are particularly helpful for first-time adventure travelers.**  The text states that a travel agent is a good choice for a ""short, post-holiday trip focused on nature, culture, language, or different countries on a smaller budget.""  First-time adventure travel often falls into this category.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ha moeti a lefella leeto la ho ya le ho kgutla la sefofane ho ya habo:** While travel agents *can* help with this, it's not their *primary* strength, especially compared to assisting with more complex or specialized itineraries. This could be handled by booking directly or using a simpler travel service.
* **C: Ha moeti a tseba puo ya lehae ya moo a etelang, ka nepo:**  The passage doesn't say the agent *needs* to speak the language.  They can still provide valuable assistance with planning and logistics, even without language proficiency.
* **D: Ha moeti a etela sebaka seo a utlwsisang botjhaba ba sona le ha bo fapane le ba hae:**  This is the *opposite* of a situation where an agent would be beneficial.  An agent is most helpful when dealing with unfamiliar cultures and environments.




"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka thusang moeti ho qoba ho se khotsofale ha etetse dibaka tse ntjha?","The correct answer is **A: Ho lebella maemo a tshwanang le a moo a tswang (Expecting similar conditions to where they are coming from)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of anticipating differences in various aspects of a new place.** This includes customs, laws, food, etc.
* **Option A directly addresses this by suggesting expecting similar conditions.** While not perfectly accurate (since the point is to expect *differences*), it's the *least wrong* and most helpful approach to reducing discomfort. By mentally preparing for potential similarities, the individual is less likely to be completely thrown off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho leka ho ja dijo tseo a sa di tsebeng (Trying to eat foods they don't know):** This is likely to *increase* discomfort, not reduce it. New foods can cause digestive issues and generally lead to unpleasant experiences.
* **C: Ho hlompha melao e tswanang le moo a tswang (Respecting laws similar to where they come from):** The passage highlights differences in laws, not similarities. Respecting laws from their home country won't prepare someone for new legal frameworks.
* **D: Ho qoba ho etsa dipatlisiso ka ditaba tsa matlo a boroko (Avoiding doing research on the home country's news):** Researching the local news and culture is precisely what someone should do to prepare for a new environment. Avoiding news would be detrimental.



Therefore, option A is the best answer, even though it's not a perfect reflection of the passage's message. It's the option that's most logically connected to reducing discomfort in a new place.



"
"Ho latela ditaba tse seratswaneng, ke mofuta ofe wa batho o ka nnang wa se khotsofale ha o etela sebaka se kantle ho naha?","The correct answer is **B: Motho ya ratang diphetoho (Someone who likes changes)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that traveling involves encountering different customs, laws, food, etc.  Someone who enjoys changes is more likely to be comfortable with these differences. The passage suggests that being prepared and open-minded is key to enjoying travel.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Motho ya ratang dijo tse sa tlwaelehang (Someone who likes unusual foods):** While trying new foods is part of travel, it's not the core reason someone would be comfortable with a new place.
* **C: Motho ya sa rateng maikutlo a fapaneng (Someone who doesn't like different feelings):** This is the *opposite* of what's needed for comfortable travel.
* **D: Motho ya ratang ho ithuta (Someone who likes to learn):**  While a good trait for travel, the passage focuses more on *accepting* and *being open to* differences, rather than specifically *wanting* to learn. A person who likes changes would *be more inclined* to learn.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke keletso efe e sa khothalletsweng moeti ya etelang naha e ntseng e thuthuha?","The correct answer is **B: Ho qoba ho ja haholo ydijo matsatsing a hao a pele.**

The text explicitly advises against eating too much in the first few days. The passage says to ""use money to stay in upscale hotels, food, and services to help you adjust to the place.""  This implies a need to ease into the new environment and avoid overexertion, including overeating.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho tseba ka mefuta yohle ya diphoofolo tse teng moo pele o robala naheng:** While being aware of local wildlife is important, the text focuses on adjusting to the *cultural* aspects of a developing country and *personal safety* related to animals, not knowing every animal species.
* **C: Mofuta wa bethe ya boikhathollo wa “cot” kapa “hammock” o a khothalletswa bakeng sa khempa:** The text advises *against* sleeping directly on the floor, even with a cot or hammock, due to potential risks from local insects and animals.
* **D: Ho ba le tjhelete e lekaneng ya hotele ya maemo a hodimo ha a qala ho fihla:** The text *encourages* having sufficient funds for upscale accommodations, as it helps with adjusting to the new environment.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa bolelwang e le eo motho a ka e etsang ho feta tekano ha a tlwaela sebaka dinaheng tse thuthuhang?","The correct answer is **C: Meterase kapa mmete sebakeng sa ho khempa (Sleeping on a mattress or floor in unfamiliar places)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Se ke wa robala materaseng kapa seponcheng fatshe dibakeng tse o sa tsebeng diphoofolo tsa sebaka."" (Don't sleep on a mattress or floor in places where you don't know the local wildlife.) This indicates that sleeping directly on the floor or on a mattress in unfamiliar places is considered risky and potentially exceeding normal acclimatization behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho ja dijo tse phehuweng ka mokgwa wa dinaha tsa bophirima (Eating food prepared in a Western style):** The passage doesn't mention anything about eating Western-prepared food being excessive.
* **B: Ho batla ditshebeletso tsa maemo a hodimo (Seeking high-end services):** The passage *recommends* using high-end services (hotels, food, etc.) *initially* to help acclimatize, so seeking these services isn't inherently excessive.
* **D: Hotele tsa maemo a hodimo (High-end hotels):** As explained in B, the passage recommends using high-end hotels initially for acclimatization.



"
"Ke efe ho tse latelang e ka bang molemo ka ho fetisisa bakeng sa motho ya nkileng sehlahiswa sa inshorense, ha a batla ho bona kopi ya sona ore hna e jwang empa a se na marang-rang?","The correct answer is **A: Ho fa motho yeo a tsamayang le yena kopi (Giving a copy to the person traveling with them).**

Here's why:

* **The question specifically asks about someone who *doesn't* have internet access.** Options B, C, and D all require internet access to create or access the copy.
* **Option A directly addresses the scenario.**  Sharing a physical copy with a travel companion ensures access even without internet.  The other options would be useless without internet connectivity.

Therefore, giving a copy to a travel companion is the most practical solution for someone without internet access.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng ho tse latelang e sa lokelang ho hlaha sehlahisweng sa inshorense?","The correct answer is **A: Dinomoro tsa matjhaba bakeng sa ho etsa dikopo (Phone numbers for making applications)**.

Here's why:

The prompt specifically states that you should include the **insurance email address and international phone numbers for assistance/applications**.  Phone numbers for applications are *not* mentioned as something that should be included. The question asks what *shouldn't* be included.

The other options *should* be included:

* **B: Aterese ya lengolo la tswibila la inshorense (Insurance email address):**  The prompt explicitly states this should be included.
* **C: Dinomoro tsa matjhaba tsa tumello (Authorization phone numbers):**  The prompt explicitly states this should be included.
* **D: Aterese ya tswibila ya monga sehlaiswa (Claims administrator address):** While not explicitly stated as *required*, it's good practice to have this information readily available as part of your insurance documentation.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke saese efe ya mofuta wa “negative” wa difoto o bontshang mofuta wa filmi o sebediswang hangata?","The correct answer is **C: 35 mm negative**.

The passage explicitly states that the most common film format is ""filimi e tlwaelehileng ya 35 mm (negative ya 36 e pheta-phetilweng ka 24 mm)"". This directly translates to 35mm film.
"
Ke dibopeho dife tsa filimi tse fanang ka boleng bo tshwanang le ba khamera ya mofuta wa DSLR?,"The correct answer is **B: Filimi ya sebopeho se mahareng (Medium Format Film)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for film formats that match the image quality of a DSLR.** DSLRs are known for their high resolution and detail.
* **The passage states that medium format film (6x6cm and 6x7cm) offers a more detailed and sharper image than 35mm film.** It explicitly says it provides a ""ponahalo e phethilweng hoo e ka bang ha nne ha negative ya 35 mm"" (a more refined look, roughly four times that of a 35mm negative).
* **While 35mm film is popular, it's generally *not* considered to have the same image quality as a modern DSLR.**
* **6x6cm film is also mentioned as providing a sharper look than 35mm, but medium format (generally referring to 6x7cm or larger) is the standard for DSLR-level image quality.**
* **6x6cm film is technically not the best answer since medium format is generally preferred for high-resolution images.**



Therefore, medium format film is the closest match to the image quality of a DSLR among the options provided.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e ka bang mohato wa ho qetela wa ho qala kgwebo ya ho ngola ka tsa maeto?","The correct answer is **C: Haha webosaete ya hao (Launch your website)**.

The passage states that after getting comfortable with online formatting and editing, you can then launch your website. This makes launching the website the final step.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ikwetlisetse ho fomata ka webosaete (Familiarize yourself with website formatting):** This is an early step in the process, *before* launching the website.
* **B: Ngola dihlooho tse mmalwa mabolokong a tsebahalang a maeto (Write a few articles on popular travel topics):** This happens *before* launching the website - you need content *for* the website.
* **D: Ntlafatsa tsebo ya hao ya ho hlophisa (Improve your organizational skills):** While organization is helpful, it's not the final step in launching a website.



"
"Ha o qala khwebo ea ho ngola ka tsa maeto, ke tsebo efe ho tse latelang e lokelang ho matlafatswa pele?","The correct answer is **A: Ho ngola kamokhwa wa blog**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what to improve *first* when starting a travel blog.** The provided text states that developing the ability to write is the *first* step to building a successful travel blog.  You need content (blog posts) *before* you can effectively format, organize, or speed up your website.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *first* step:

* **B: Ho fomata webosaete (Formatting website):** You need content to format.
* **C: Ho hlophisa (Organizing):**  You need content to organize.
* **D: Ho iqapela webosaete (Speeding up website):** You need a functional website with content to optimize for speed.

Therefore, writing compelling blog posts is the foundational skill to develop first.
"
Ke maemong afe a lehodimo ao bohloko ba mala bo fumahalang haholo?,"The correct answer is **B: Maemo a lehodimo a batang ka ho fitisisa**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jwalo ka mathata a amanang le ho hema dibakeng tse batang, mathata a ka maleng dibakeng tse tjhesang a tlwaelehile haholo mme maemong a mangata a tena haholo empa ha kotsi hakaalo.""

This translates to: ""Regarding problems related to eating in unclean places, problems can often occur in seemingly clean places, and in many cases, they are not that dangerous.""

The key phrase is ""seemingly clean places"" (maemo a lehodimo a tjhesang). The passage emphasizes that even *seeming* clean places can be problematic.  The phrase ""ka ho fitisisa"" (extending to/reaching) implies the danger is not limited to just seemingly clean places, but can extend to more extreme unclean situations.

Therefore, **B: Maemo a lehodimo a batang ka ho fitisisa** best captures the danger described in the passage.  Option A is too limited, and options C and D don't fit the nuance of the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho pepeseha kgafetsa ho ka thusa boitshereletso kgahlanong le eng?","The correct answer is **B: Dikokwana-hloko tsa lehae** (Household bacteria).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hae, ka lebaka la ho pepesetseha kgafetsa ho dikokwana-hloko tsa sebakeng, ho na le menyetla ya hore o se ntse o kgona ho itshireletsa ho tsona."" This translates to ""Well, because of frequent contamination from household bacteria, there are ways you can still protect yourself from them.""

The passage then goes on to discuss bacteria in other parts of the world and the problems they can cause, including diseases like Delhi Belly.  It contrasts this with the more common and less dangerous bacterial problems associated with ""ho hema dibakeng tse batang"" (contaminated environments), implying household bacteria are a primary concern.



Therefore, the statement that frequent contamination from household bacteria can help with protection is directly supported by the passage."
"Ho tse latelang, ke molemo ofe wa ho tsamaya ka hara sebaka sa Schengen?","The correct answer is **A: Ho qoba dikopo tse ngata tsa visa.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ka ho ba le visa ya Schengen, ha ho hlokahale hore o ngodisetse di-visa bakeng sa dinaha tsohle tsa Schengen ka ho fapana, ka hoo o boloka nako, tjhelete le ho tlatsa difomo.""  This directly addresses the benefit of avoiding multiple visa applications.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ho boloka tjhelete:** While avoiding multiple visa applications *does* save money, the text focuses more on the time and effort savings.  It's a consequence of saving on application fees.
* **C: Ho qoba dibaka tse ngata tsa ho hlahloba bukana ya ho eta:** The Schengen area allows you to cross borders *without* needing to be checked as frequently (within the area), but it doesn't eliminate all border checks.
* **D: Ha ho hlokahale bukana ya ho eta:**  This is incorrect. You *do* need a visa (specifically a Schengen visa) to enter the Schengen area.



"
Ke eng e kekeng ya hlola e fumanwa lebitleng la Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Maruo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Maruo a makatsang a lebitla ha sa leyo ho lona, empa a tlositswe a yiswa Musiamo ya Egepeta e leng Cairo."" This translates to: ""The intricate jewelry of the coffin is not on it, but was removed and taken to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo."" 

Therefore, the passage says that jewelry was *not* found in the coffin.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe sa teropo ya Vancouver se ke keng sa khahla haholo ho baeti ba sedi ka ditjeo? ","The correct answer is **C: Sehlekehleke sa Bowen**.

Here's why:

The text describes Bowen Island as a destination for kayaking, hiking, and enjoying a ""true village"" atmosphere. This suggests a more relaxed, less flashy vibe compared to the other options. 

*   **Sehlekehleke sa Granville** is mentioned as the starting point for ferries, implying a more central and potentially bustling location.
*   **Phaseje ya The Sea to Sky** refers to the road, not a specific destination, and is more about the journey.
*   **Whistler** is explicitly linked to the Winter Olympics and known for skiing and other outdoor activities, indicating a higher level of popularity and likely more tourism.

Therefore, Sehlekehleke sa Bowen is the most likely option to be less ""glamorous"" for visitors seeking a quiet, nature-focused experience."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe se nang le bokhoni ba ho fa moeti phihlelo ya nnete ya ho etela Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Sehlekehleke sa Bowen**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sehlekehleke sa Bowen ke leeto la letsatsi le ratwang kapa leeto la ho intsha la mafelo-beke le akarelletsang kayaking, ho hlwa dithaba, mabenkele, dibaka tsa ho jela, le ho hong. Motse ona wa nnete o sebakeng se leng Howe Sound ho tloha fela Vancouver, mme o fihlelleha ha bonolo ka ditekese tsa metsing tse lokiseditsweng tse tlohang Sehlekehlekeng sa Granville se leng toropong ya Vancouver.""

This directly identifies Bowen Island as a place offering a genuine experience of visiting Vancouver. While Whistler is mentioned, the text focuses on Bowen Island as the primary location for this type of experience. Granville Island is described as the departure point for water taxis, not the destination itself."
"Ho latela seratswana, baeti ba lokela bo etela Phororong neng haeba ba re ba batla ho e boha ho se se ba tshirang?","The correct answer is **D: Nako ya selemo eo pula e sa neng**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ho latela pula (November ho ya ho March), tekanyo ya metsi e tla ba hodimo mme Diphororo di tla ba le matla haholo."" This translates to: ""According to the rains (November to March), the water level will be high and the rapids will be very powerful.""

Therefore, if a tourist wants to avoid being swept away by the rapids, they should visit during the **dry season** when the water levels are low. Option D is the only one that implies a time *without* the heavy rains mentioned in the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke bothata bofe boo motho a ka kopanang le bona ha etela phororo ya Victoria Falls dipakeng tsa Pudungwana le Tlhakubele?","The correct answer is **C: Tjhebahalo e sa tlwaelehang ya Phororo (Unusual sight of the Falls)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""O netefatswa hore o tla koloba ha o feta borokgo kapa o tsamaya ditselaneng tse haufi le Diphororo. Lehlakoreng le leng, ke lebaka la hore tekanyo ya metsi e hodimo haholo hoo ho sheba ha hao Diphororo ho tla sireha—ke metsi ohle.""  This translates to: ""You are guaranteed to get soaked if you go past the railing or walk close to the Falls. On the other hand, because the water level is so high, viewing the Falls will be obstructed - by water.""

Therefore, the unusual sight of the Falls due to the excessive water is the main problem mentioned.



The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dibaka tse khahlang tsa Phororo tse sa sirwang ke letho (There are no dry spots at the Falls):** The text says you *will* get soaked.
* **B: Bahahlaudi ba fokolang (Few tourists):** The text indicates that many tourists visit.
* **D: Ho qoba nako ya selemo eo pula e nang (Missing the rainy season):** The text clarifies that the rainy season (when the Falls are at their most powerful) is when to visit."
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e sa khothalletsweng ha motho a sebedisa khamera e fofang?","The correct answer is **A: Ho sheba pele hore na o dumelletswe ho nka ditswantswo moo.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Haeba ho nka senepe sa ntho e itseng ho sa dumellwa, o se ke wa naha le ho e nka video.""  This means you *must* check if you are allowed to film a location before you even start.

While options B, C, and D might be good practices, they aren't as directly addressed as the fundamental need to check for permission.  Option A is the most direct and critical warning given in the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke dibaka dife tsa mantlha tseo motho a ka sebedisang khamera e fofang?","The correct answer is **D: Dibakeng tseo o fumaneng tumello pele.**

Here's why:

* **The first paragraph emphasizes the importance of permission.** It explicitly states, ""Haeba ho nka senepe sa ntho e itseng ho sa dumellwa, o se ke wa naha le ho e nka video."" (If taking a picture of something is not allowed, do not enter and take a video.)
* **The second paragraph discusses regulations and permits.** It highlights the need to check regulations and obtain permits, especially when using a drone.
* **Option D directly reflects this emphasis on obtaining permission.**  The passage implies that you can use a camera in a location *if* you have secured the necessary authorization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pela batho ba sa tlo sitiswa ke letho ha khamera e fofang e nka ditshwantsho** (People are not harmed when a camera takes pictures): This is an overly broad and inaccurate statement.  Regulations are in place for various reasons beyond just potential harm.
* **B: Dibakeng tseo ho nka ditshwantsho hangata ho sa dumellehang** (Places where taking pictures is often not allowed): This is the *opposite* of what the passage advocates. It stresses avoiding places where photography is prohibited.
* **C: Dibakeng tse phetheselang moo khamera e fofang e sa bonahaleng ha bobebe** (Places where a camera can take pictures discreetly): While discretion might be a consideration, the core message is about legal permission, not simply taking pictures without being noticed.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe mabapi le dipehelo tsa ho ngodisa “visa” eo eseng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Haeba o dula matlong a boroko a bahahlaudi ha o wa lokela ho ngodisa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Maemong a mang, ke bao feela ba dulang kantle ho dintlo tsa bahahlaudi ba tshwanetseng hore ho ngodise."" This means that if you are staying in a hotel, you *might not* need to register, unlike if you are staying in a private residence. Option A directly contradicts this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dinaha kaofela di hloka hore ho ngodiswe le ba boholong** - The text implies that not all countries require registration.
* **C: Ho etela dikantoro tsa bojaki ho ka hlokahala** -  The text mentions filling out forms or visiting immigration offices *in other countries*, but it doesn't say it's a universal requirement.
* **D: Dibakeng tse ding, dihotele tsa lehae di ka etsa ngodiso** - The text states that in many countries, *hotels* are the ones who register (but you should confirm this).

Therefore, only option A is directly refuted by the information given in the text.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke sebaka sefe seo mohahlaudi a ke keng a ya ho sona sebakeng sa ngodiso?","The correct answer is **A: Mapoleseng a lehae (Home police station)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that in many countries, hotels are responsible for registering guests. It also mentions that in some cases, only guests staying in guesthouses need to register.  The passage does *not* mention home police stations as a place where a guest would register. Options B, C and D are not mentioned or implied in the text.
"
Ke mang a ke keng a una molemo wa ho ithaopa ha etile?,"The correct answer is **B: Motho ya shebileng mokgolo o toma.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the *benefits* of travel.**  It highlights personal growth, cultural understanding, and new opportunities.
* **Option B describes someone who is fearful and hesitant to take risks.**  This directly contradicts the proactive and open-minded attitude needed to benefit from travel.  Fear would prevent them from experiencing the cultural immersion and personal growth described.
* **Options A, C, and D all describe potential benefits of travel.**  While someone might *hope* for those things, the passage focuses on the broader, more significant advantages. Option B describes someone who is actively *preventing* themselves from experiencing those benefits.

Therefore, the person who is fearful and hesitant (""shebileng mokgolo o toma"") is the least likely to benefit from travel.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, boithaopo bo ka thusa moeti ya mose ho mawatle ya nkileng tjhelete e lekaneng jwang?","The correct answer is **B: Hanagata bo lebisa ho menyetla aa mesebetsi** (It doesn't directly provide assistance with job opportunities).

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes the benefits of volunteering – cultural understanding, meeting new people, personal growth, and gaining new skills. While the text mentions the possibility of earning a small income, it doesn't directly link volunteering to finding job opportunities. Option B, suggesting that volunteering can lead to job leads, aligns with the potential for skill development and networking mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Mokholo o batla o dula o fanwa** (The employer wants to be housed) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Dijo le boroko di ya fanwa ka dinako tse ding** (Food and lodging are provided at other times) - While some volunteering programs offer this, it's not a universal or guaranteed outcome and not directly emphasized in the text.
*   **D: Bo ka thusa motho ho ba le maikutlwo a hlaphohetsweng** (It can help people have a determined mindset) - While personal growth is a benefit, the text doesn't specifically highlight that volunteering directly improves a determined mindset.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke ntho efe e nkuwang e tlwaelehile ho maeto a mmalwa a ho ya Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **D: Ho nka bese ho tloha boemafofane o ya hoteleng**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho eta ho “tlwaelehileng” ho akarelletsa ho fofa o ye Boema-fofane ba Ditjhaba ba Orlando, ho palama bese e yang hoteleng e Disney..."" This means taking a bus from the airport to a Disney hotel is considered a typical part of a Disney World trip.
"
"Ho tse latelang, ke polelo efe ka Walt Disney World eo eseng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Ditekete tse kenang dibakeng tsohle tsa moo, tsa boikgathollo di ka fitisetswa ho baeti ba bang.**

The passage explicitly states that Disney **does not allow** tickets to be resold. Therefore, option A is the false statement.

Here's why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **B: Matlo a bodulo a fumaneha moo:** The passage mentions staying at a Disney hotel.
* **C: Dibese di ya fumaneha ho lata baeiti boemafofane di ba isa sebakeng seo:** The passage mentions flying into Orlando International Airport and then taking a bus to a Disney hotel.
* **D: Ditekete tsa matsatsi a mangata di ka fumaneha ho marangrang a fantisi:** The passage states that tickets are often bought online through websites like eBay and Craigslist.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke ntho efe e ka nnang ya ba ha ya kenella boithutong bo porofeshenale le dingolilweng?","The correct answer is **D: Tshwantsiso ya se ka etsahalang** (Emergency preparedness).

Here's why:

The text outlines a professional training program for visiting remote areas.  The key components are:

*   **Comprehensive training:** Covers all aspects of survival in the environment.
*   **Practical experience:**  Includes hands-on exercises and first aid.
*   **Resources:** Books and magazines on survival and wilderness living.

The question asks what *isn't* typically included in this professional training.  While the other options *could* be relevant, they are not core components of a comprehensive professional wilderness survival training as described.

*   **A: Ho hlola diqholotso tsa lefelleng (Assessing risks):** This is certainly important for any wilderness trip, but it's a foundational step, not a core part of the *training* itself.
*   **B: Ho bona ho re ditshebeletso tsa thuso ya pele di dula di le malala-a laotswe (Knowing that first aid services are always available):** This is incorrect. A key aspect of wilderness survival training is learning to be self-sufficient in first aid because professional help may be far away.
*   **C: Ho ba malalaotswe ha sebaka sa ntwa (Being a local resident):** Being a local resident doesn't automatically equip someone with the skills needed for a visitor undertaking a remote trip.  The training is designed for outsiders.
*   **D: Tshwantsiso ya se ka etsahalang (Emergency preparedness):** This is what is not necessarily included in a wilderness survival training program because the training program is geared toward helping individuals be self-sufficient in dealing with emergencies.

Therefore, **emergency preparedness** is the best answer because the training aims to equip visitors with the skills to handle emergencies independently, implying a focus on *self-sufficiency* rather than relying on external resources (even if those resources are available).

"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e kekeng ya nkwa e le keletso e nepahetseng bakeng sa ho bapala korostina hantle?","The correct answer is **C: O hlokomele ho tobetsa dikonopo ha o ntse o boloka letsoho le iketlileng**.

Here's why:

* The prompt states: ""Hopola ha ho hlokehe hore o tobetse dikonopo ka thata hore modumo wa piano o utlwahale o phahame haholo."" This emphasizes the importance of proper finger technique and a relaxed hand.
* Option C directly aligns with this instruction.  Maintaining a relaxed hand while pressing the keys properly is crucial for good organ playing and avoiding fatigue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakeng sa molumo o eketsehileng, eketsa matla ao u otlang linotlolo ka ona:** While using strength is *part* of producing sound, it shouldn't be the primary focus. It's more about *controlled* strength.  The prompt emphasizes avoiding unnecessary tension.
* **B: Boloka ho sisinyeha ho sa hlokahaleng bonyane e le hore u boloke matla a hao:**  This is generally good advice for musicians, but the prompt's core message focuses on proper finger technique and relaxed hands as the *foundation* of good playing.
* **D: Eketsa lebelo leo o sebedisang seqha ka lona ho fihlela modumo o eketsehileng:**  While adjusting the bellows is how an organist increases volume, it doesn't relate to proper hand technique.



"
"Ha u bapala korostina, ke efe ho tse latelang e tla thusa ho eketsa modumo?","The correct answer is **A: Lebelo le eketsehileng (Increased bellows)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ha o letsa korostina, hore o eketse modumo, o sebedisa di-bellow ka ho di hatella kapa ka ho phahamisa lebelo."" (When playing the organ, to increase the volume, you use the bellows by pumping them harder or by raising the foot pedal.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matla a eketsehileng (Increased force):** While increased force *can* contribute, the passage specifically focuses on the bellows.
* **C: Kgatello e fokolang (Less key pressure):**  The passage says to press the keys *hard* to get the sound to be loud.
* **D: Ho fokotseha ha monoana (Less foot pressure):**  The passage instructs to press the keys hard, implying a strong foot pressure is needed.



"
Hobaneng ha ditshwantsho tse thelebisheneng di kgaotswe mahlakoreng?,"The correct answer is **B: Hore setshwantsho se tlale sekrini kaofela.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Dintho tsohle tseo o di bonang thelevisheneng di ne di sehilwe meedi, hodimo, tlase le mahlakoreng. Sena se etsetswa ho netefatsa hore setshwantsho se tlala sekerine kaofela."" (Everything you see on television is cropped at the top, bottom, and sides. This is done to ensure the picture fills the screen.)



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakeng sa ho dumella dihloho (To allow titles):** While titles might be considered, the primary reason isn't just for titles.
* **C: Ho lumella phetoho e bonolo ho lifomete (To allow easy format changes):** This is not the reason for overscan.
* **D: Ho seha dihloho haufi haholo le botlase (To hide titles closer to the bottom):**  This isn't the purpose of overscan. Overscan's aim is screen filling, not hiding titles.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mathata afe ho a latelang ao motho a ka kopanang le ona ha a fetolela filimi ho fomete ea DVD?","The correct answer is **A: Setshwantsho se sa tlatseng sekirini kaofela (The picture not filling the entire screen)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""overscan"" is the process of cropping the edges of the image to ensure it fits the screen. 
* If you don't account for overscan when converting a movie to DVD, the edges of the image will be cut off, resulting in a picture that doesn't fill the entire screen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dihloho tse sehiloloeng ka mokgoa o sa fellang (Halves of heads being cropped)** - While overscan *can* potentially crop parts of objects (like heads), it's not the primary or guaranteed problem. The main issue is the overall image not filling the screen.
* **C: Setshwantsho se tlatsang sekirini kaofela (The picture filling the entire screen)** - This is the *opposite* of what happens with overscan.
* **D: Kgaola meeli (Black borders)** - Black borders can be a result of overscan, but it's not the direct consequence. The more fundamental issue is the image not covering the entire screen.

Ho ne ho e-na le sesole sa Borithane se neng se le hokae?,"The correct answer is **A: Assunpink Creek**.

The passage states: ""Molaodi James Ewing o ne a nka masole a 700 ho tshela noka ya Trenton Ferry, a hape borokho bo leng **Assunpink Creek** mme a thibele masole le ha e le afe a dira hore a balehe.""
"
Ke mosaeno oa mang o hlahileng mongolong o ngotsweng ka letsoho?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The passage states: ""lengolo le ngotsweng ka letsoho le saennweng ke Mopresidente wa Lekgotla John Hancock le **Mongodi Charles Thomson**..."" This indicates that Charles Thomson was one of the people who penned the Declaration of Independence.
"
"Hara tulo tse latelang, ke efe ya ho qetela eo pampiri e kgolo ya Dunlap e fihletseng ho yona?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The text states: ""Kopi ile ya fihla London ka August 10."" (The copy arrived in London on August 10th.) This is the final destination mentioned in the passage.
"
Mabotho a Kolonele Stark a ne a le ho kae?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka pela terata**.

The text states: ""Banna ba Stark ba ile ba nka maemo haufi le terata e leng ka qetellong ya leboya moo e leng boemo ba Bo-radikoloni."" (Stark's men took position near the ridge at the far end of the bay, which was the position of the Radikoloni.)  And later: ""Gridley kapa Stark o behile thupa e ka bang bophahamo ba maoto a 100 (30 m) ka pele ha terata..."" (Gridley or Stark placed a gun about 100 feet (30 m) ahead of the ridge...).
"
"Ho latela seratswana, banna ba Stark ba ile ba eketsa terata ya bona neng?","The correct answer is **D: Ha mabotho a ntse a nka boemo ba pele.**

The passage states: ""Banna ba Stark ba ile ba nka maemo haufi le terata e leng ka qetellong ya leboya moo e leng boemo ba Bo-radikoloni.""  This indicates they added their barricades *as* they took position.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e neng e le nako e tletseng tlhekefetso ka ho fetisisa ya Chaena?","The correct answer is **D: Nakong ya Borena bo Boraro (Three Kingdoms Period)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mehleng eo ho bile le dintwa tse mahlo mafubedu pakeng tsa baetapele ba bangata ba lwanelang setulo sa borena. Mehleng ya Mebuso e Meraro e bile nako e tletseng tshollo ya madi e ngata nalaneng ya Chaena ya Mehleng ya Bohololoholo...""

This translates to: ""During that time, there were many fierce conflicts between various leaders vying for power. The Three Kingdoms Period was a time of great bloodshed and heavy financial loss in ancient China...""

Therefore, the Three Kingdoms Period is described as the most turbulent time in Chinese history according to the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, nnete ke efe ka sehlopha sa bohloa ba sesole se kenang mokgahlelong oa bo hloma-u-hlomole?","The correct answer is **B: Ba ba le phepelo e nyane ya dijo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bohlwa bo qala mokgahlelo wa hloma-o-hlomole ha dijo tse leng teng di fokotsehile."" (The animal begins the hibernation cycle when the available food has decreased.) This directly indicates a lack of food is the trigger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba aha bodulo bosiu** (They hold a ceremony at night): The passage doesn't mention any ceremonies.
* **C: Ba etsa madulo a fetolwang ka mora matsatsi a 17** (They perform a ritual after 17 days):  While the hibernation lasts 17 days, the passage doesn't say they perform a ritual *after* that time.  It's about the *start* of the hibernation.
* **D: Ba tsamaya motshehare** (They migrate): The passage explicitly states they *don't* migrate, they hibernate.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e buang ka nepo ka mekgwa ya sephiphitha sa dikokonyana ya ho etsa bodulo nakong ya hloma-u-hlomole?","The correct answer is **C: Ba tjhentjha bodulo letsatsi le letsatsi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka nako ya mokgahlelo ona, bohlwa bo etsa dihlaha tsa nakwana tse fetolwang letsatsi le letsatsi."" This translates to: ""During this period, the baboons make short journeys that are changed day by day.""  The term ""dihlaha tsa nakwana"" (short journeys) implies they are foraging for food. While the other options might be *partially* true, only option C directly reflects the described behavior of actively seeking and consuming food each day during the drought.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e tla tswella pele ho tsotellehe boteng ba matshwao a ka ntle?,"The correct answer is **B: Merethetho ya dinako tse itseng (Quorum Sensing)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what *promotes* the development of extracellular toxins.** The passage explicitly states that ""Merethetho ya nako e itseng"" (Quorum Sensing) are rules based on the concentration of signaling molecules.  These rules are crucial for microbes to coordinate their behavior, including the production of toxins, when they reach a certain population density.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matshwao le diketsahalo tse ka hare (Intracellular pathogens and internal events):** While internal factors *can* influence toxin production, the question is about what *promotes* the development of *extracellular* toxins.  Quorum sensing is more directly linked to extracellular toxin production.
* **C: Nako ya tlhaho (Natural time):**  While environmental conditions can *influence* toxin production, the passage highlights a specific regulatory mechanism (quorum sensing) over just ""natural time.""
* **D: Merethetho e shebiloeng (Predictable rules):** This is too vague. While there are rules, ""merethetho ya dinako tse itseng"" (quorum sensing) provides a much more specific and accurate answer to the question.



Therefore, quorum sensing is the most direct and accurate answer to what promotes the development of extracellular toxins, based on the information provided in the text.



"
Ke lentswe lefe le hlalosang batho ba bontshang phapang ya ditlwaelo tse itseng tsa tlhaho?,"The correct answer is **D: Popo e fapaneng (Different populations)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks for the word that describes people showing different variations in certain natural traits.
* The text states that ""batho ka bomong ba bontsha mefuta e mmalwa e sa tshwaneng ya tshobotsi e itseng"" which translates to ""people often show a few different variations in certain traits.""
* **Popo e fapaneng** directly refers to different populations, implying different groups of people with distinct characteristics, including natural traits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Poponngwe (Population):** While related, ""poponngwe"" is a broader term referring to a group of individuals of the same species living in the same area. It doesn't specifically address variations in traits.
* **Dintho tse phelang (Living things):** This is too general. It refers to all organisms, not specifically to variations in traits within a population.
* **Mefuta (Species/Types):** This refers to distinct biological categories, not necessarily the variations within a single population.



"
Ke lentswe lefe le nepahetseng ho a latelang bakeng sa dintho tse phelang tulong e itseng?,"The correct answer is **B: Baahi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines ""baahi"" (habitants/inhabitants) as living things with specific habitats.** The question asks for a suitable word for living things in a specific place.
* **""Baahi"" is used repeatedly in the passage to refer to the living beings in a particular environment.**
* **The other options don't fit the context as well:**
    * **Poponngwe (species):**  While related, it refers more specifically to groups of organisms. The passage talks about the inhabitants *of* a place, not just the species themselves.
    * **Mefuta (types):**  This is too general. The passage implies there's a specific group of living things being discussed, not just ""types"" of life.
    * **Popo e fapaneng (different populations):** Similar to ""mefuta,"" this is too broad.  The passage focuses on the inhabitants of a particular location.

Therefore, **Baahi** is the most accurate and contextually appropriate word.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya eba mohlala wa ketsahalo ya bohahlauli e thehiloeng tlhahong?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho etela musiamo wa saense**.

Here's why:

* **Bohahlauli bo thehiloeng tlhahong (Ecotourism)** focuses on responsible travel to natural areas, conserving the environment, and improving the well-being of local people. 

Let's look at the options:

* **A: Ho tsamaya ka maoto ho ya phororong (Hiking in the forest):** This is a classic example of ecotourism, enjoying nature responsibly.
* **B: Ho nka dinepe tsa dipalesa tsa naheng (Collecting national flowers):**  If done sustainably and with permission, this can be part of ecotourism, promoting appreciation for the natural environment.
* **C: Ho etela musiamo wa saense (Visiting a science museum):** Science museums are typically focused on education and technology, not primarily on experiencing and conserving natural environments.  While a museum *could* have exhibits on ecology, the core activity isn't ecotourism.
* **D: Ho tshwasa ditlhapi ka difofane (Birdwatching with binoculars):** This is a direct example of enjoying and appreciating wildlife, a key component of ecotourism.



Therefore, visiting a science museum is the only option that doesn't fit the definition of ecotourism.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e leng motheo wa motjha wa dipalangwang?","The correct answer is **C: Bodulo bo tsitsitseng (Stable structure)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saense hona jwale e bontsha hore ho ba teng hona ha carbon ho sentse tlhaho ho tloha boemong bo bong ba yona bo tsitsitseng haholo bo tshehetsang ho iphetola ha motho dilemong tse dimillione tse pedi tse fetileng.""

This directly implies that the core of the evolutionary process is the existence of a *stable structure* (in this case, a carbon-based structure) that can undergo change. The other options are components *of* the process, not the fundamental core.

*   **A: Dibaka tsa mesebetsi (Workplaces):**  Workplaces are a result of human civilization, not the evolutionary mechanism itself.
*   **B: Dikoloi tsa botho (Human vehicles):**  Vehicles are a technological development and irrelevant to the evolutionary process being described.
*   **D: Tswelopele ya batho (Human evolution):**  Human evolution is the *outcome* of the process, not the *core mechanism*.



"
Dikarolo tse potapotileng dikhubu ya sele di na le mofuta ofe wa tjhatjhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Matla a motlakase a dielektrone tse fokolang le tse ngata**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dielektrone di na le bokgoni bo tlaase ba motlakase."" (Electrons have a low electrical charge.)
* **The passage also states:** ""Diprothone di na le bokgoni bo phahameng ba motlakase ha di-neutron di se na motlakase."" (Protons have a high electrical charge, while neutrons have no charge.)
* **Therefore:** Atoms are composed of protons (positive charge), neutrons (no charge), and electrons (negative charge).  While a single electron has a low charge, the *collective* charge of electrons contributes to the overall electrical properties of the atom.  Electrons are numerous, and their combined (though relatively small) electrical charge is a key factor in atomic behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matla a motlakase a dielektrone:**  This is too general.  It doesn't account for the fact that there are many electrons, each with a low charge.
* **B: Ha ho matla a motlakase:** This is completely false.  Electrons *do* have electrical charge.
* **C: Matla a motlakase a dielektrone tse ngata:** While the electrons are numerous, this doesn't address the varying amounts of charge contributed by each electron.



"
Khubu ya sele e bopilwe ka dikarolo dife?,"The correct answer is **D: Diprothone, dinyutrone, le dielektrone**.

The passage states: ""Khubu e na le dikarolwana tse pedi - di-neutron le diprothone. Diprothone di na le bokgoni bo phahameng ba motlakase ha di-neutron di se na motlakase. Dielektrone di na le bokgoni bo tlaase ba motlakase.""  This means all three are components of the nucleus.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, mohlala wa palo ya baenari e nang le dikarolo tse hlano ke efe ho tse latelang?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **Binary Numbers:** Binary numbers use only 0s and 1s. Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit as 2<sup>0</sup>, then 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, and so on.

Let's examine each option:

* **A: 1010:** This is a four-digit binary number.
* **B: 12001:** This is a five-digit decimal number, not a binary number.
* **C: 10010:** This is a five-digit binary number.  Let's convert it to decimal to verify:
    (1 * 2<sup>4</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>3</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>2</sup>) + (1 * 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>0</sup>) = 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 18 (decimal)
* **D: 110101:** This is a six-digit binary number.

Therefore, the only option that represents a five-digit binary number is 10010.
"
Dinomoro tsa binary di bitswa eng hape?,"The correct answer is **C: Dijakone**.

Binary digits are commonly referred to as **digits** or **bits**. The closest option to ""bits"" from the choices provided is ""Dijakone"".

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that writing blogs helps students improve their writing skills (""mongodi wa blog o qala ho leka ka matla ho ngola hantle hore a seka a tshwaiwa diphoso""). It also mentions that blogging encourages students to learn about things they are interested in, which inherently boosts language learning.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported:

* **B: Ho fokotseha ha ho nyatswa ho tswa ho dithaka (Reduction of stress from exams):** While blogging might reduce exam stress indirectly, it's not the primary or most direct benefit mentioned in the text.
* **C: Tlhokomediso e atolositsweng ya tikoloho (Structured environment):** Blogging doesn't necessarily create a structured environment. It's often a more free-form activity.
* **D: Takatso e eketsehileng ya ho tswela pele ho ithuta (Increased motivation to continue learning):** While blogging *can* increase motivation, the passage primarily highlights the direct skill development aspect.



Therefore, the most directly and strongly supported benefit of blogging for students, according to the passage, is the improvement of their language learning and writing skills.
"
Ke dintlha dife ho tse latelang tsa ho ngolla di-blog tse qotsitsweng e le ntho e susumetsang baithuti ho ntlafatsa tsebo ya bona ya ho ngola?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho boloka thahasello ya bamamedi ba bona**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tlhokahalo ya ho fepa dithahasello tsa ba balang e kgothalletsa diithuti ho ba bohlale le ho thahasellisa (Toto, 2004)"".  This means keeping the readers (the audience) interested is crucial for students to become knowledgeable and engaging writers.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported:

* **A: Ho arabela kgafetsa ho disebedisweng tsa inthaneteng:** While the passage mentions responding to online resources, it's presented as a *method* students can use, not the primary *motivation* for blogging to improve writing.
* **B: Takatso ya ho qoba ho nyatsuwa:** The passage doesn't mention fear of judgment as a motivating factor in blogging.
* **D: Tlhokahalo ya ditshebedisano:** While blogging *can* foster communication, the core idea highlighted is maintaining audience interest, which drives the need for engaging content.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng molemo wa puisano e sa tsitsang bakeng sa baithuti? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dihora tse bonolo tsa ho sebetsa (Flexible work hours)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights that flexible work hours *can* be beneficial by allowing students to manage their time and pace. However, the passage also mentions that having fixed timeframes for work hours is beneficial as well.  ""Dihora tse bonolo tsa ho sebetsa"" (Flexible work hours) could actually be *detrimental* to consistent and reliable communication.  Without set times, it becomes harder to predict when a student will be available, leading to delays and disruptions.

Let's look at why the other options *are* beneficial for consistent communication:

* **A: Tšebediso ya marang-rang e le sesebediswa (Using the internet as a tool):**  This is clearly beneficial. The passage explicitly states the internet allows students to reach out to instructors anytime.
* **B: Ho fihlella difahleho ho barupedi ka nako efe kapa efe ya letsatsi (Accessing instructors anytime):**  This is also beneficial, as stated in the passage. It enables quick responses and avoids waiting for the next scheduled meeting.
* **D: Taolo ya lebelo (Time management):**  The passage emphasizes time management as a benefit of allowing students to structure their own work. This contributes to predictable communication.



Therefore, flexible work hours (option C) are the *least* beneficial for consistent communication, and in some ways, potentially *detrimental*.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ya dikarolo tse latelang tsa puisano e sa fetoheng bakeng sa baithuti?","The correct answer is **B: Dihora tsa ho sebetsa (Work Schedules)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""It includes also the allowance of flexible work hours."" This directly corresponds to option B. The other options are mentioned as benefits or consequences *related* to flexible work hours, but not the core, unchanging element.

* **Lebelo la ho ithuta (Learning Expectations):** While important, the passage doesn't focus on specific learning expectations.
* **Boitsebiso bo rutang (Self-directed learning):** The passage mentions self-directed learning as a *result* of flexible hours, not a defining characteristic.
* **Tshebediso ya inthanete (Internet use):**  The passage highlights the *impact* of internet use, not the core structure itself.



"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang seratswaneng see e le ntho eo motho a ka e amahanyang le diqhobosheane tsa mehleng e bohareng?,"The correct answer is **C: Boikemisetso (Dedication)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the sounds of traditional ceremonies involving drumming, dancing, and conflict. It highlights the significance and intensity of these events. The question asks what is *not* typically associated with these ceremonies.

* **A: Dikoti tsa dikoting (Drum skins):** Drums are central to the ceremony and therefore associated with it.
* **B: Ho lwana ka dipere (Fighting with spears):**  Conflict and spear fighting are part of the ceremonies described.
* **C: Boikemisetso (Dedication):** While ceremonies can be about dedication, it's not a *direct* or *primary* auditory or visual element described in the passage. The passage focuses on sounds and actions of conflict and celebration.  Dedication is a more internal, less outwardly expressed aspect.
* **D: Bahlabani (Combatants):** Combatants are actively involved in the conflict aspect of the ceremony.

Therefore, **boikemisetso (dedication)** is the option that is least directly and obviously related to the described traditional ceremonies. It is the most ""sa bolelwang seratswaneng"" (not typically associated) with the scene.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bolelwang temaneng e le monko kapa modumo o ka hlahiswang hara dithako tsa qhoboshyane?,"The correct answer is **B: Tshabo (Fear)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes common elements of ancient ceremonies: drumming, marketplaces, and sacrifices. It highlights the sounds of drums, chanting, and the fear associated with combat rituals. However, it asks what *isn't* typically found in these ceremonies.

While the passage mentions the sounds of drums and chanting (which evoke fear), it doesn't explicitly state that fear is a *component* or *element* of the ceremony itself. Fear is a *response* to the ritual and its potential violence. The passage focuses on the sounds, sacrifices, and the *actions* within the ceremony.

Let's look at why the other options are likely present:

* **A: Dintwa (Animals):** Sacrifices often involved animals.
* **C: Mekete (Marketplaces):** Markets were likely part of the broader societal context surrounding these ceremonies, perhaps for procuring resources or offering goods.
* **D: Ditlhako (Sacrifices):**  Sacrifices (of animals or even humans, as hinted at) were a key part of the rituals.



Therefore, **fear** is the element that is most likely a *response* to the ceremony, rather than a fundamental *component* or *element* within it.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e leng tlhaloso e nepahetseng ya Qhoboshyane ya Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **B: E ne e hloka tshireletso e fokolang ka lebaka la tlhaho ya kgotso ya naha nakong ya kaho.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ho latela mehla eo, Qhobosheane ya Kirby Muxloe e nkwa e le ntlo e tlwaelehileng e sireleditsweng ho fapana le ho ba qhobosheane ya nnete. Ha ho ke ke ha kgoneha hore difensetere tsa yona tsa kgalase le mabota a masesaane a setlele ka nako e telele ha ho hlaselwa ka matla."" This means it wasn't designed for heavy defense.
* The text also mentions: ""ha Lord Hastings a qala ho e haha, ho ne ho batla ho na le kgotso mme ho hlokahala tshireletso feela kgahlanong le dihlotshwana tse nyane tsa bafutuhi ba ntseng ba solla.""  This indicates that the initial focus was on a fortified house, not a heavily defended castle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mabota a teteaneng a qhoboshyane a ile a koptjwa ke Lord Hastings:** The text doesn't state that elaborate curtain walls were built.
* **C: Kaho ya qhoboshyane e ne e sa tlwaeleha ka nako eo:** The text indicates it was *considered* a typical fortified house, not unusual.
* **D: E ne e hahilwe ho boloka ditlhaselo tse telele le tse ikemiseditseng:** The text focuses on defense against minor raids, not long-term protection or independence.



"
Ke efe ho dikarolo tse latelang tsa kaho e ka nkwang e le ntho e sa tlwaelehang bakeng sa Qhobosheyane ya Kirby Muxloe ka nako e hlalositsweng temaneng ee?,"The correct answer is **B: Motheo o hahilweng ho emelana le ditlhaselo (A reinforced core).**

Here's why:

* The text states that Kirby Muxloe was *not* a typical castle and that its windows and small towers wouldn't withstand prolonged attacks. 
* Lord Hastings built it with defense in mind, but initially only against minor raids. This implies a need for *stronger* defenses than a typical castle of the time.
* A reinforced core would provide significantly more structural strength, making it much harder to breach than a standard castle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Difensetere tse kgolo (Large windows):** Large windows would be a *weakness* in a defensive structure, not a feature of a strengthened castle.
* **C: Tshireletso e fokolang ho feta ya diqhoboshyane tse ding (Less defense than other castles):** The text says the opposite - that Kirby Muxloe was specifically built for defense.
* **D: Mabota a masesaane (Small towers):** The text indicates the towers were a weakness. Reinforcement would be needed, not smaller towers.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ka bang molemo ka ho fetisisa ho semathi se itokisetsang sehla se tlang?","The correct answer is **B: Ho tsepamisa maikutlo ho hlaoleng lebelo ha o ntse o koetlisa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes controlling expectations and being aware of all risks.**  Option B directly addresses this by focusing on controlling expectations *during* training.
* **The passage mentions gradual increases in distance.** Option B aligns with the principle of controlling intensity (which is related to expectations) as fitness increases.
* **The other options are less directly supported by the text:**
    * A: While training in different terrains is beneficial, the passage specifically recommends open-air running and controlling risks, not just training in one location.
    * C: Setting a timer is a general training practice, but doesn't specifically relate to managing expectations and risks as strongly as option B.
    * D: Using dumbbells focuses on strengthening the upper body, while the passage specifically mentions the whole body and managing overall risks.



Therefore, controlling expectations and being aware of risks during training is the most relevant and beneficial approach according to the passage.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e leng ya bohlokwa ka ho fetisisa ho semathi-se-ipabolang-sa-halofo-ya maele?","The correct answer is **B: Ho hlaolela mamello ho feta lebelo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ke nnete hore motho ya mathang halofo ya mile a le sehlopheng se pele, o tshwanetse ho ba le boholo ba lebelo bo lekaneng, mme mamello e lokela ho hlaolelwa dikotsing kaofela."" (It is true that a person in the first trimester of pregnancy should have a reasonable expectation, but the expectation should be balanced against all risks.)

This means managing expectations (mamello) is crucial and potentially *more* important than just focusing on the expected development (lebelo). The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Ho itlwaetsa ho matha ka hara naha nakong ya dikgwedi tsa mariha** (Exercising during the first trimester): While exercise is generally good, the passage doesn't prioritize it.
*   **C: Ho kena ka tlase ho metsotso e mmedi** (Going deep for two minutes): This is irrelevant to the passage's focus on pregnancy management.
*   **D: Ho hlaolela lebelo ho feta mamello** (Balancing expectation over expectation): The passage states the opposite - managing expectations against the expected development.



"
"Bakeng sa moatlelete, ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya finyellwa feela ka mekgwa ya phepo e nepahetseng?","The correct answer is **C: Tshebetso e phahameng (Peak Performance)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while good health *won't* automatically lead to peak performance, it *can* positively impact overall athletic longevity.
* The passage emphasizes things like maintaining fitness levels, hydration, and understanding the body's systems – these are important for *improvement* in performance, not necessarily reaching the highest possible level.
* **Peak performance** implies reaching the very top of one's potential, which often requires more than just basic good health. It involves specialized training, talent, and other factors not directly addressed in the passage.
* Options A (improve performance), B (increase enjoyment), and D (overall good health) *are* things that can be achieved through good health, according to the passage.

Therefore, ""Peak Performance"" is the only option that isn't directly suggested as a guaranteed outcome of good health alone.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e sa buellwang e le tsela ya hore baatlelete ba batjha ba fumane thabo e eketsehileng papading ya bona?","The correct answer is **A: Ho itlwaetsa phepo e nepahetseng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mekgwa e hantle ya phepo e nepahetseng ka boyona e ke ke ya baka ho bapala hwa boemo bo phahameng, empa e ka ama ho phela ha baatlelete ba batjha ka kakaretso ka tsela e bonahalang.""  It then lists things that can help young athletes *enjoy* their sport.  ""Ho itlwaetsa phepo e nepahetseng"" (maintaining a healthy lifestyle) is the first and most encompassing option mentioned as a way to help them enjoy their sport more.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

* **B: Ho sebetsa ka mokgwa o tsitsitseng:** While important for athletic development, the passage doesn't directly link this to *enjoyment*.
* **C: Ho kenya metsi hantle:**  This is important for performance and health, but again, not directly tied to enjoyment.
* **D: Ho boloka botsitso ba matla a bophelo bo botle:** This is similar to A, but ""ho itlwaetsa phepo e nepahetseng"" is a broader term encompassing maintaining healthy habits.



Therefore, the passage emphasizes a healthy lifestyle as a key factor in allowing young athletes to enjoy their sport.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke hobaneng semathi sa sebaka se mahareng se ka reka sesebediswa se turang hofeta?","The correct answer is **A: Ke kgetho ya bona ya botho (It's their personal choice)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where people buy products they don't really need or that have little practical use, often influenced by marketing and perceived desirability. The core point is that the purchase is driven by *personal desire or inclination* rather than a rational need or proven benefit. The passage explicitly states ""Baatlelete ba ka ikutlwa ba rata sehlahiswa le hoja se sa fane ka melemo ya nnete"" (Athletes might feel they love the product even though it doesn't provide real benefit).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E na le melemo e netefaditsweng (It has proven benefits):** The passage implies the products often *lack* proven benefits.
* **C: E tla ama tshebetso ya bona haholo (It will significantly improve their performance):** Again, the passage suggests this is not the case; the products have little practical use.
* **D: Ho na le maikutlo a fosahetseng mabapi le disebediswa tse theko e tlaase (There are false feelings about low-cost products):** While there might be *perceptions* about low-cost products, the passage is more focused on the overall *desire* for products, regardless of cost.

Therefore, the passage points to the *personal choice* being the reason why people purchase these items.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho matha sebaka se bohareng ho hloka eng?","The correct answer is **A: Disebediswa tse ngata (Many equipment)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the matha (gym/facility) lacks equipment and that many essential parts are missing. While athletes might be drawn to products, they often don't provide real benefit if the necessary equipment is absent.  Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the facility needs *more equipment*.
"
Ke mang ya sibolotseng matla a khohedi a nyutlelie? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch le Purcell**.

The text states: ""Ho resonance ena, matla a kgohedi le maqhubu a seya-le-moya ho baka diathomo ho ntsha matshwao a seya-le-moya a manyenyane. Ka selemo sa 1930, Felix Bloch (ya neng a sebetsa Univesithi ya Stanford) hammoho le Edward Purcell (ya tswang Univesithi ya Harvard) o a fumanwa."" This indicates that Bloch and Purcell discovered the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance.
"
Tumello ya molao e ile ya fanwa ka selemo sefe bakeng sa tshebediso ya sekene sa bongaka? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Dilemo tse nne hamorao ho ile ha fanwa ka tumello, eo e neng e le tumello ya ho qala lefatsheng e ntshitsweng lefapheng la MRI.""  Four years after what? The text indicates that the development of MRI started in the 1970s.  Therefore, the patent was granted in 1974.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, batho ba lokela ho ba le kutlwisiso e matla ya eng e le hore ba ka hlalosa diketso tsa batho ba bang?","The correct answer is **B: Boikemisetso (Empathy)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Har’a bokgoni bona, ho utlwisisa **boikemisetso** ba batho ba bang ho bohlokwa haholo."" (Among these abilities, understanding the **commitment/empathy** of other people is very important.)
* Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. It's crucial for interpreting actions, especially when those actions might seem strange or inexplicable.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Takatso (Hope):**  While hope can influence behavior, it's not the core ability for understanding *why* someone does something.
* **C: Tumelo (Belief):** Belief is about accepting something as true. It doesn't directly relate to understanding another person's motivations.
* **D: Maikutlo (Feelings):** Feelings are a component of empathy, but the passage emphasizes the *understanding* of another person's state, which is more accurately described as empathy.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho utlwisisa morero ho thusa batho ho etsa eng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho sheba batho ba bang ntle le kahlolo.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding people's motivations and intentions *before* jumping to conclusions. It specifically contrasts two scenarios to illustrate how context changes interpretation. This aligns directly with the idea of observing others without judgment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho fedisa ho se kgodisehe ka diketso tsa ba bang:** While understanding motives *can* help avoid jumping to conclusions, the core of the passage isn't about preventing judgment in general. It's about understanding *why* someone might act a certain way.
* **B: Ho bolela ditakatso:** The passage doesn't mention predictions or forecasting.
* **D: Ho bala dikelello tsa ba bang:** The passage states that we are capable of understanding the successes, commitment, belief, or knowledge of others, not simply reading their experiences.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e leng kakaretso e nepahetseng ya sepheo se seholo sa AI?","The correct answer is **D: Mosebetsi o iketsang (Autonomous work)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""Phuphutso ho AI e akarelletsa ho etsa metjhini hore e etse mesebetsi ka ho iketsahallang e hlokang monahano wa motho."" (The future of AI includes creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like reasoning.)
*  ""Mosebetsi o iketsang"" (Autonomous work) directly reflects this key aspect of AI's development and potential.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Thero (Intelligence)** - While AI involves intelligence, the passage emphasizes *how* that intelligence is manifested – through autonomous task performance.
* **B: Temoho ya lentswe (Language processing)** - Language processing is *one* application of AI, but not the overarching theme described in the passage.
* **C: Kemiso (Planning)** - Planning is *another* application, but again, not the central concept.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo AI e atisang ho amahanngwa le yona?","The correct answer is **A: Tshebeletso ya bareki (Customer service)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions that AI is being used for ""ho araba mathata le dipotso tsa bareki"" (to solve problems and answer questions of customers). This is a clear example of AI being applied to customer service.
* While AI *can* be used for planning (B), generating text (C), and analyzing images/facial expressions (D), the text specifically highlights customer service as an application.

Therefore, **Tshebeletso ya bareki** is the option that aligns most directly with the information provided in the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e leng matla a motho ya nang le mekgwa ya ho nahana e feto-fetohang?","The correct answer is **B: Ho sebedisa mekgwa e mecha bothateng.**

Here's why:

The passage describes people with a particular thinking style as those who can think logically, strengthen their reasoning in dilemmas, solve problems, and deal with scientific tests. It specifically states that this type of thinking involves considering only *two* possible answers, one correct and one incorrect. This implies a focus on exploring different *methods* or approaches to a problem, rather than just finding a single solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho fumana dikarabo tse ngata tse nepahetseng bothateng:** The passage explicitly states that there is only *one* correct answer.
*   **C: Ho ipha nako ya bona ho rarolla mathata:** While time management is helpful, it's not directly linked to the *type* of thinking described.
*   **D: Mekgwa ya ho tshwara ka hlooho:** This is not related to the analytical thinking described in the passage. It suggests impulsive decision-making.



"
"Ho latela seratswana sena, ke efe ho e latelang e sa nkweng e le sepheo sa mohopolo o feto-fetohang wa ho nahana?","The correct answer is **B: Ho ipha nako**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a specific type of thinking characterized by a single, correct solution.  Let's look at why the other options *are* part of this thinking process:

* **A: Ho utlwisisa hore ho na le karabo e le nngwe feela e nepahetseng:** This is the *defining* characteristic of this thinking style.
* **C: Ho kgetholla dintlha:**  Gathering information is essential to arrive at the correct solution.
* **D: Ho bokella tlhahisoleseding:**  Being open to new information helps refine the understanding and pinpoint the correct answer.

* **B: Ho ipha nako** is not directly linked to the process of finding a single, correct solution. While time might be *spent* gathering information or considering options, the ability to quickly identify the *one* correct answer isn't a core component of this thinking style as described.  It's not mentioned in the passage as a characteristic of this type of thinking.



Therefore, ""Ho ipha nako"" (Spending time) is the option that *doesn't* fit the description of the single, correct solution thinking style.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya nkwa e le polelwana-e-nyane?","The correct answer is **D: Ho fana ka mahlohonolo**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses microexpressions – very brief facial expressions that can reveal a person's true emotions. The examples given (like twitching, brief skin changes) are all involuntary and fleeting.

*   **Ho sheba ka thoko ha o ntse o bua (Looking sideways while speaking):** This is a microexpression, suggesting discomfort, deception, or thought.
*   **Ho phunya phatla (Quickly sniffing):**  This is a microexpression that can indicate stress or anxiety.
*   **Ho panya ka potlako (Quickly blinking):** This is a microexpression that can signal nervousness or deception.
*   **Ho fana ka mahlohonolo (Offering congratulations):**  This is a *deliberate* action, not a spontaneous, brief facial expression. It's a conscious social gesture, not a microexpression.

Therefore, offering congratulations is the only option that doesn't fit the definition of a microexpression as described in the passage.



"
Ke efe ya dipolelo tse latelang mabapi le tlhaloso ya polelwana-e-nyane eo e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **D: E ka thusa ho hlahloba botshepehi (It can help to assess truthfulness)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the connection between subtle facial expressions and truthfulness.**  It states that even people who can't consciously understand language can perceive subtle cues in facial expressions that indicate truth or falsehood.
* **Oliver Sacks' study highlights this point.** He showed that individuals with impaired language comprehension could accurately detect deception based on non-verbal cues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Direkoto tsa divideyo di lebisitse tswelo-peleng e kgolo (Video recordings have advanced greatly):** While true, this isn't the *main point* of the passage. The passage isn't about the technology of video recording, but what can be *learned* from the recordings.
* **B: Tlhaloso e nepahetseng e ka lemoha leshano (Accurate description can recognize lies):** The passage *implies* that accurate description can *help* recognize lies, but it doesn't state that a *description alone* is enough.  It emphasizes the role of subtle, almost unconscious perception.
* **C: Puo hammoho le ponahalo ya sefahleho dia hlaloswa (Language and facial appearance are described):** The passage mentions both language and facial appearance, but it's the *interaction* and the subtle cues in facial appearance, rather than the language itself, that are the key focus.



Therefore, option D is the best answer because the passage explicitly states that the ability to detect subtle facial cues *can* aid in assessing truthfulness.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ileng ya ba ya bohlokwa haholwanyane ka lebaka la Tsosoloso? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ho hopola mongolo (Remembering texts)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Motho ha a sa na kgatello ya ho hopola, empa bokgoni ba ho hopola sengolwa e bile yona ntho eo ho amehilweng ka yona."" (People didn't have a knack for remembering, but the ability to remember writing was the thing that was happening.)  The Renaissance significantly changed the way people learned and acquired knowledge, and a key part of that change was focusing on the preservation and study of written texts.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ho hopola motho ka mong (Remembering individuals):** While important, the passage focuses on the shift towards textual learning, not personal recall.
* **B: Tsebo e potolohang (Specific knowledge):** The Renaissance led to *more* knowledge, but the primary change described is *how* that knowledge was acquired (through texts).
* **D: Ho fumana dintlha (Acquiring information):** This is a broader concept. While acquiring information was important, the passage emphasizes the *method* of acquiring it – by studying and remembering written material.



"
"Ka lebaka la Tsosoloso, ho ile ha ba le ho hatiswa ho fokolang hofe ho tse latelang?","The correct answer is **C: Ho hopola mongolo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Motho ha a sa na kgatello ya ho hopola, empa bokgoni ba ho hopola sengolwa e bile yona ntho eo ho amehilweng ka yona."" (People didn't have the ability to memorize, but the ability to remember writing was the thing that was happening.)

The passage then links the Renaissance to a major change in learning and acquiring knowledge. This change was centered around the increased importance and ability to *remember written material*.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ho hopola motho ka mong:** The passage doesn't mention a change in the ability to remember individuals.
* **B: Ho fumana tsebo:** While the Renaissance led to increased knowledge acquisition, the passage focuses on the *method* of acquiring knowledge – specifically, the shift towards reading and remembering written text.
* **D: Kabo ya ditaba:**  The passage doesn't discuss news or information networks.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bontsheng tshusumetso ya ho sebedisa inthanete bakeng sa dikamano tse tswelang pele?,"The correct answer is **A: Kgokahano ya kgwebo (Business communication)**.

Here's why:

The question asks which option *doesn't* demonstrate the influence of internet use on *social relationships*. The passage highlights ""learning"" and ""having friends"" as key motivators for internet use related to social interaction.  ""Growing business"" primarily relates to professional activities and economic transactions, not social connections. The other options (talking to family, research, meeting new people) all directly relate to building and maintaining relationships.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bontsheng tshusumetso ya ho sebedisa inthanethe bakeng sa ho ameha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho batla resepe (Looking up a recipe)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how the internet helps with **social connection and emotional support** when people are experiencing loneliness. Options B, C, and D all relate to connecting with others or addressing personal needs, which can alleviate loneliness. 

Looking up a recipe is primarily a practical task – it's about fulfilling a need for food, not necessarily about addressing feelings of loneliness or fostering social connection. It doesn't directly contribute to mitigating the feeling of being alone.
"
Europe Bophirimela e ile ya kgaotsa neng ho itshetleha haholo ka ditshusumetso le ho qala ho iketsetsa mokgwa wa yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho elella bofelong ba Mehla e Bohareng**.

The passage states: ""Leha ho le jwalo, kaha metjha ya puisano e ne e tsamaya butle, ditaele tsa ka bophirimela di ne di ka salla morao ka dilemo tse 25 ho ya ho 30. **Ho elella qetellong ya Mehla e Bohareng, Yuropa bophirimela e ile ya qala setaele sa yona.**""  This clearly indicates that the Renaissance marked the beginning of Western Europe's independent fashion trends.
"
Ho sebedisa dikonopo ho tiisa diaparo ho bile phello ya eng? ,"The correct answer is **A: Nako ya Gothic**.

The text states that the introduction of buttons to fasten garments was a major innovation during the Gothic period, driven by the need for more secure clothing due to the rise of powerful armies.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e nkwang e le tharollo ya nako e telele ditabeng tsa tikoloho?","The correct answer is **B: Boiketsiso (Sustainability)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes long-term solutions.** It talks about addressing environmental issues for the future (""mahlomola a nako e tlang"").
* **Sustainability** is all about meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This is a long-term approach to environmental issues.
* **The passage contrasts sustainability with a quick fix (""motso wa mathata, mme re a fedise"").**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ho tlohela mekgwa e mebe ya bophelo (Lifestyle changes):** While lifestyle changes are *part* of sustainability, they are not a comprehensive long-term *solution* on their own. They are more of a component.
* **C: Ho hlwaya sesosa sa mathata (Problem-solving):** Problem-solving is necessary, but it doesn't guarantee a long-term solution. It addresses immediate issues.
* **D: Ho ba motswalle wa motsamayo wa tikoloho (Becoming an active participant in environmental action):**  Being an active participant is important, but it is not a solution. It is more about taking action, not resolving the fundamental issue.



Therefore, **Boiketsiso (Sustainability)** is the most accurate answer reflecting the passage's focus on long-term environmental solutions.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ya ditharollo tse latelang e ke keng ya nkwa e le phekolo ya matshwao a ditaba tsa tikoloho?","The correct answer is **B: Ho tima disosa tsa ditaba**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes environmental problems as needing solutions like those in the animal kingdom, where adaptation and minimizing harm are key.**
* **""Ho tima disosa tsa ditaba"" (Ignoring environmental news) is the *opposite* of addressing the problem.** It's a way of avoiding the issue rather than finding a solution.
* **Options A, C, and D all represent proactive approaches to environmental issues:**
    * **Ho ikakgela ka setotswana (Adapting/Learning from nature):**  Directly aligns with the passage's analogy to the animal kingdom.
    * **Ho fana ka maikutlo mabapi le kgetho ya bophelo bo feteletseng (Promoting sustainable lifestyle choices):** Encourages actions to reduce environmental impact.
    * **Ho phela ka tsela e baballang tikoloho (Living in an environmentally responsible way):**  The core of environmental stewardship.



Therefore, ignoring environmental news is the action that would *not* be considered a solution to environmental problems.



"
Ntwa ya pele ya Europe e bile naheng efe eo ho neng ho bolelwa hore taba ya yona e bohareng e amana le ho leka-lekana ha matla ho e-na le ho ba le taba ya bodumedi?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

The passage states: ""Ntwa ya Tlhahlamano ya Borena ba Spain e bile ntwa ya pele eo sesosa se ka sehloohong sa yona e neng e le tekatekano ya matla."" (The Union of Iberian States of Spain was the first union where the main objective was to achieve a balance of power.)
"
Ke ntwa efe eo ka dinako tse ding e hlaloswang e le ‘ntwa ya bodumedi’ ya ho qetela?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntwa ya Dilemo Tse Mashome a Marero (Treaty of the Nine Years)**.

The passage states: ""Ntwa ya Dilemo Tse Mashome a Marero e ne e tla ba ntwa ya ho qetela e rehwang ntwa ya bodumedi."" which translates to ""The Treaty of the Nine Years was to be the last treaty ratified as a treaty of peace.""
"
Ke dintlha dife ho tse latelang tsa Kereke e Khatholike tse neng di sa hlahlojwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Bongata ba matla ka hare ho Kereke.**

Here's why:

The passage highlights that the Catholic Church had immense power and wealth. This power and wealth were questioned over time, suggesting it wasn't always viewed as being wielded appropriately or justly.  The passage explicitly states: ""taba ena ya hore kereke e na le matla le tjhelete tse ngata e entse hore ba bangata ba ipotse hore na tumelo ena e ne e latelwa ka nepo."" (the fact that the church had so much power and money made many people question whether this faith was followed properly).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Haeba kabo ya leruo ka hare ho Kereke e ne e loketse:** While the passage mentions the ideal of using resources to alleviate suffering, it doesn't directly state whether the Church's internal organization was always adequate.
*   **B: Haeba ditaba tse kholo tsa bodumedi di lokela ho lokiswa:** The passage does not mention the need to fix major problems of faith.
*   **D: Haeba ho ne ho finyellwa dithuto tse kgolo tsa Kereke:** The passage mentions theological learning but doesn't indicate a problem with the existence of these doctrines, only with their application or the Church's overall power.

Therefore, the Church's **power and wealth** were the most directly questioned aspects mentioned in the passage, making **C** the best answer.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya bolailweng Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Molebedi**.

The text states: ""ka nako e nngwe setho sa sehlopha seo se halefileng se ile sa tsoka hlooho ya molebedi wa boreneng ya bolailweng Versailles kapela Mofumahadi ya tshohileng.""  This translates to: ""At one point, a member of the group that rushed forward seized the head of the male valet who had been executed at Versailles along with the deceased Queen.""
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya qobellwa ho Morena le Mofumahadi ke mokhopi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho tswa ka tshohanyetso ho tloha Versailles**.

The text states they returned to Paris *with* a group of merchants. It doesn't mention a forced departure *from* Versailles. The other options are all mentioned as things that happened to them.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya bakwa ke ntwa e sa tlwaelehang ya sesole sa metsing ya Brithani?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho ile ha etswa diphetoho molaong wa amatjhaba**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that the blockade violated widely accepted international law.** This directly contradicts option C.
* **The passage describes the blockade as successful in protecting shipping and civilians.** This supports the ideas in options A (German U-boats using similar tactics) and B (unescorted ships being at risk).
* **The passage mentions that vital supplies were not reaching Germany.** This aligns with option D.

Therefore, the only statement that isn't supported by the text is that international law was changed. The blockade *violated* existing international law.



"
Ke polelo efe e sa hlaloseng ka nepo thibelo ya sesole sa Brithani kgahlanong le Jeremane?,"The correct answer is **A: E ne e le kgahlanong le molao wa matjhaba**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Leano lena le ile la sitisa phepelo ya bohlokwa ya sesole le baahi, le hoja thibelo ena e ile ya tlola molao o neng o amohelwa ka kakaretso o neng o ngotswe ditumellanong tse ngata tsa matjhaba dilemong tse fetile tse makgolo a mabedi."" (This plan saved the lives of sailors and civilians, although the blockade violated a widely accepted law enshrined in many international treaties over the past two major decades.)

This directly indicates that the blockade was a violation of international law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E ile ya qholotsa ntwa ya sesole sa metsing sa Jeremane:** While the blockade *did* impact German submarines, the passage focuses more on the violation of international law than on directly attacking their underwater bases.
* **C: E ile ya sitisa phallo ya phepelo ya Jeremane:**  The blockade *did* restrict German shipping, but the passage highlights the violation of international law as the core issue.
* **D: E ile ya etsa bonnete ba hore dikepe tse sa nkeng lehlakore di ke tsa senyeha:**  The passage mentions the danger to neutral ships, but this isn't the primary point about the blockade's problematic aspect.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**."
"Ho ipapisitswe le seratswana sena, ho ka etsahala hore ebe hangata ho fumanwa hore ke motho ofe ya nang le Multiple Sclerosis?","The passage states that young adults have twice the likelihood of developing MS compared to older adults. Of the options provided, **A: Mosadi ya dilemo di 32 (A 32-year-old woman)** is the most likely answer because 32 falls within the young adult age range mentioned.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, barupeduwa mesebetsing ya kamehla ba ne ba hloka tshehetso e eketsehileng bakeng sa eng?","The correct answer is **A: Maikutlo a fosahetseng ka bohloko (Traumatic fear)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""People participating in rehabilitation consistently need significant support regarding the ingrained fear of trauma in order to perceive the endless variations and not feel uncomfortably self-conscious about normal bodily sensations.""  This directly points to the need for support related to *traumatic fear*.  While the other options might be related, ""traumatic fear"" is the most accurate and specific term used in the text.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, hangata papadi ya fensing e bapalwa jwang?","The correct answer is **D: Ka dibopeho tse pedi**.

Here's why:

* The first paragraph states that fencing is practiced in various settings, ""from university students to professional and Olympic levels.""
* The question asks how fencing is usually practiced according to the text.
* Since it's mentioned in multiple settings, the most accurate answer is that it's practiced in *both* university and professional/Olympic settings.

Therefore, option D is the best fit. While the text mentions university and Olympic levels directly, the phrase ""dibopeho tse pedi"" (two formats/structures) implies more than just those two specific levels. It hints at different ways the sport is structured and practiced across different skill levels.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ka bang pontsho e matla ka ho fetisisa ya chefu ya ka hare?","The correct answer is **C: Ho ba le ho hlaba ho matla le bohloko ka mpeng.**

Here's why:

* **Internal bleeding** often presents with symptoms like severe abdominal pain and a feeling of anxiety or dread (fear/anxiety). The pain can be intense and localized.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *most* significant indicator of internal bleeding:

* **A: Ho nyekelwa ke pelo le feberu (Chest pain and fever):** While chest pain and fever can be serious, they are more commonly associated with heart problems, infections, or pneumonia, not typically a direct sign of internal bleeding.
* **B: Ho hlatsa le ho fufulelwa (Vomiting and diarrhea):** Vomiting and diarrhea can occur with a wide range of illnesses and aren't specifically linked to internal bleeding.
* **D: Botlolo ya pidisi ya ngaka (Doctor's stethoscope):** A stethoscope is a tool for listening to the body, but it doesn't directly indicate internal bleeding. It's used to assess heart and lung sounds.



**Important Note:**  *Any* suspected internal bleeding is a medical emergency. If you suspect someone is experiencing internal bleeding, seek immediate medical attention by calling an ambulance or going to the nearest emergency room.  Do not try to self-diagnose.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, mohato wa pele o nepahetseng ke ofe ha ho hlahlojwa motho ya hlokofaditsweng?","The correct answer is **A: Hlokomela ketsahalo eo (Attend to the situation)**.

Here's why:

The first sentence in the original text emphasizes the importance of checking the environment and ensuring safety *before* approaching the person.  Option A, ""Hlokomela ketsahalo eo"" (Attend to the situation), is the most logical starting point – understanding what happened and the overall context is crucial before engaging with the person.

Let's break down why the other options are not the *first* step:

* **B: Atamela mohlaseduwa (Approach the person):**  This is too soon.  Safety and understanding the situation come first.
* **C: Sheba boemo ba mohlaseduwa (Assess the person's condition):**  While assessment is important, you can't properly assess someone without first understanding the situation and ensuring your own safety.
* **D: Emela thuso (Call for help):**  Calling for help might be necessary, but it's not the *first* step.  First, you need to understand the situation and assess if intervention is safe and appropriate.



"
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e sa bontsheng ka nepo mokgwa wa ho hlahloba mohlasediwa?,"The correct answer is **A: O se ke wa ameha ka ho ba le maqeba (You should not touch the sludge)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks which action *doesn't* represent a proper way to inspect sludge.**  Touching sludge is inherently unsafe. Sludge can contain harmful bacteria, chemicals, and other contaminants.

Let's look at why the other options *are* proper inspection techniques:

* **B: Lekola sebaka ka pela mohlaseduwa (Inspect the area around the sludge):**  This is crucial to understand the extent of the contamination and identify potential sources.
* **C: Sheba boemo ba mohlaseduwa (Check the condition of the sludge):** Observing the sludge's appearance (color, consistency, odor) can provide clues about its composition and potential hazards.
* **D: Leka ho ela hloko difolakha tse kgubedu (Be careful of splashing):**  This is a safety precaution to prevent exposure to harmful materials.



Therefore, touching the sludge is the one action that's explicitly unsafe and doesn't contribute to proper inspection."
Ke diphetoho dife tse bakilweng ke Phetohelo ya Mafora tse bileng le tshusumetso e kholo ho baahi ba sehlopha sa basebetsi?,"The correct answer is **B: Phetoho ya maikutlo ho tloha sehlopheng ho ya ho bokgoni.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ho a tshwana le sesoleng hobane ho fapana le hore maemo sesoleng a itshetlehe ka maemo a motho setjhabeng, batho ba ne ba se ba fuwa maemo ho itshetlehile ka bokgoni ba motho.""  This directly translates to a shift in perception from being defined by group membership to being defined by individual ability.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Tshehetso e eketsehileng bakeng sa setjhaba:** While there might have been increased support for the nation, the core shift wasn't simply about more support, but *how* people viewed their place within the nation.
* **C: Ho amohelwa ha maikutlo a Rephabliki:** The text mentions the acceptance of Republican ideals, but the primary change was in how individuals perceived themselves and their capabilities, not just the acceptance of a political system.
* **D: Sistimi e ntjha ya ho metha:**  The text mentions a new merit-based system, but the *effect* on workers was the change in their self-perception, not the system itself.

Therefore, option B best captures the fundamental change in mindset experienced by the workers as a result of the Fora Revolution.
"
"Ka mora Phetohelo ya Mafora, katleho sesoleng le mesebetsing e meng e ne e sa ka ya thehwa hodima eng?","The correct answer is **A: Katleho (Success)**.

The passage states: ""Kamora Ho Lwanela Phetoho Fora, mesebetsi e ile ya bulelwa banna bohle ba kenyang dikopo, *leng se tlisitseng katleho ho ba nang le ditabatabelo tse hodimo le ba atlehileng*."" (After the Fora Change, jobs were offered to all men who applied, *resulting in success for those with high expectations and those who performed well*.)

The passage doesn't mention success in terms of a group, support, or position. It explicitly connects the Fora Change with *katleho* (success) in job applications.

Ke tshebeletso efe ya setjhaba eo hothweng e baka ho se kgotsofale ka ho fetisisa dinaheng tse tswetseng pele?,"The correct answer is **A: Boleng ba metsi (Water Quality)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that developed countries often have similar low ratings for water and soil quality, which is a common finding from environmental surveys. This suggests a consistent, ongoing problem.  The question asks why environmental surveys consistently show these low ratings and why engineers are constantly working on them.  Poor water quality is a persistent and significant environmental concern in many developed nations, requiring continuous effort and monitoring.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Kaho ya borokgo (Waste Disposal)** - While waste disposal is important, the passage focuses more directly on water and soil quality.
* **C: Dipalangwang tsa setjhaba (Public Transport)** - Public transport issues are certainly present but aren't highlighted as the consistently problematic area in environmental surveys like water quality is.
* **D: Thuto (Education)** - Education is a crucial aspect of society, but it's not typically the focus of environmental monitoring and surveys in the same way as pollution levels.



Therefore, **Boleng ba metsi (Water Quality)** is the most fitting answer based on the information provided in the passage.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho ka thweng ka dipalangwang tsa setjhaba?","The best answer is **C: Di baka ditletlebo tse ngata ke ba di sebedisang (They produce many illusions for users)**.

Here's why:

* **The question is about illusions created by simulations.** The passage explicitly asks why simulations, especially in areas like water quality and soil erosion, give misleading results.  This points to the concept of simulations not perfectly representing reality and potentially creating ""illusions.""
* **Option C directly addresses this.** It acknowledges that simulations can generate misleading results for users.
* **Other options are less relevant:**
    * **A: Di ratwa haholo ke bohle ba di sebedisang (They are highly loved by all users):**  This doesn't address the core problem of misleading results.
    * **B: Ha di mpe jwalo ka boleng ba metsi (They are not as bad as water quality):** This is irrelevant to the question about simulations and their accuracy.
    * **D: Ke mahala dinaheng tse ngata tse tswetseng pele (They are free in many developed countries):**  This is about cost, not the accuracy of the simulations.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and directly relevant answer to the question posed.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo ho ka bang thata ho e lekanya ka lebaka la ho se tsitse ha bakhanni?","The correct answer is **A: Lebelo la sephethephethe (Traffic anticipation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka bomadimabe, ho ithuta phallo ya sephethephethe ho boima hobane boitshwaro ba mokganni bo ke ke ba hakanngwa ka ho tiiseha ho feletseng."" (Generally, learning traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of other drivers cannot be measured with complete certainty.)

While traffic anticipation is *influenced* by driver behavior, it's the *most directly impacted* by the uncertainty of other drivers' actions.  You can't accurately measure how much a driver anticipates others will do, because you can't perfectly predict what they *will* do. The other options are more measurable:

*   **Moralo wa tsela (Road design):** Roads have physical characteristics that can be measured.
*   **Tshebetso ya ditsela (Road operations):** Traffic counts and other operational data are collected.
*   **Phallo ya Sephethephethe (Traffic flow):**  While difficult, traffic flow *can* be quantified using things like vehicle counts per unit time.

Therefore, **Lebelo la sephethephethe (Traffic anticipation)** is the most difficult to measure due to the inherent uncertainty of other drivers.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sebediswang ha e emela phallo ya sephethephethe ka dipalo?,"The correct answer is **D: Bongata ba Sephethephethe (Traffic Volume)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...sephethephethe se sekametse ho tshwana mme ho ka bontshwa ka dipalo."" (Traffic has become quantifiable and can be shown with numbers.)
* **The passage also says:** ""Dikamano tsena di thusa ka ho rera, boqapi le ditshebetso tsa disebediswa tsa tsela."" (These relationships help in planning, design, and operation of road facilities.)

Traffic volume directly relates to how many vehicles are using a road, which is a measurable quantity. The other options are less directly quantifiable as traffic flow:

* **A: Tshebetso ya ditsela (Road operations):**  While traffic volume *influences* road operations, it's not the measurement *of* traffic flow itself.
* **B: Boitshwaro ba mokganni (Driver behavior):**  Driver behavior is difficult to quantify consistently.
* **C: Moralo wa ditsela (Road layout):** Road layout is a design element, not a measurement of traffic.

Therefore, **Bongata ba Sephethephethe (Traffic Volume)** is the most accurate answer because it's a directly measurable quantity used to represent and analyze traffic flow.



"
Hershey le Chase ba sebedisitse eng ho kenya DNA ya bona? ,"The correct answer is **D: Dikokwana-hloko**.

Here's why:

The question states that Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to *deliver* their DNA into bacteria. Bacteriophages are made of protein coats surrounding the genetic material (DNA). They didn't use phosphorus or sulfur directly, but rather the entire bacteriophage particle, which *contained* the DNA.

The experiment used phosphorus-32 (radioactive phosphorus) to label the protein coat and sulfur-35 (radioactive sulfur) to label the DNA. This allowed them to track where the DNA went after the bacteriophages infected the bacteria.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
"
Matla a hore phetoho e fetisetswe baneng e itshetlehile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Mofuta wa phetoho**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diphetoho tse bang teng di ka ba le diphello tse fapa-fapaneng ho ya ka mofuta wa phethoho..."" This directly indicates that the type of mutation is the key factor determining the impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haeba disele e le dikokwana-hloko:** While the location of the mutation *can* be relevant, the passage emphasizes the *type* of mutation as the primary determinant of the effect.
*   **B: Bohlokwa ba diphatsa tsa lefutso:** The passage mentions the importance of the gene, but again, the *type* of mutation is presented as more crucial.
*   **D: Haeba phetoho e ka baka lefu la sele:** While some mutations *can* lead to cancer, the passage doesn't imply that this is the defining factor. It focuses on the different effects of different types of mutations.

Therefore, the passage explicitly points to the **type of mutation** as the most important factor influencing the outcome.
"
"Ho latela boitsebiso bo fanweng seratswaneng sena, diphello tse sa tshwaneng tsa ho fetoha ha diphatsa tsa lefutso ha dia itshetleha ka eng?","The correct answer is **D: Mofuta wa phetoho e amehang**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the effects of mutations vary depending on the *type* of mutation. It explicitly mentions that only mutations in germ cells (sperm and egg) are heritable and can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in somatic cells (other body cells) don't have these effects. Therefore, the type of mutation is the key factor determining the potential for heritable effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ke karolo e kae ya diphatsa tsa lefutso e amehang:** The passage doesn't focus on *where* the mutation occurs within the genome, but rather *what kind* of mutation it is.
*   **B: Haeba disele tse anngweng ke dikokwana-hloko:** While germ cells are important, the question asks about the determinant of *different* effects, not just the location of the cells.
*   **C: Bohlokwa ba diphatsa tsa lefutso tse amehang:** While the significance of mutations is important, it's the *type* of mutation itself that causes the variation in effects.

Therefore, the type of mutation is the most important factor determining whether mutations will have heritable and noticeable effects.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e neng e se lebaka leo ditso tsa kgale di neng di boloka dipodi?,"The correct answer is **A: Di ile tsa fana ka monyetla wa ho fumana nama**.

The passage states: ""Ditso tsa kgale le merabe di qadile ho di ruwa bakeng sa ho fumana habonolo lebese, **moriri, nama, le matlalo**.""  This directly indicates that hunting was done to obtain meat. While the other options might be *potential* benefits, the passage explicitly mentions meat.
"
Sepheo sa papadi ya kolofo ke ho nka bonyane ba eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Dibolo**.

The passage states: ""Kolofo ke papadi eo ho yona dibapadi di sebedisang melamu hore di otle dibolo di kene ka hare ho dikoti.""  This translates to ""Kolofo is a game where players use pieces to get pawns into the boxes."" Therefore, the pieces being moved are the pawns (dibolo).
"
"Lebaleng la kolofo, jwang bo kgutsufatswa kae?","The correct answer is **C: Sekoting sa pele**.

The text states: ""ha dibapadi di qala sekoting sa pele lebaleng..."" which translates to ""when the players start in the first round of the back...""  Therefore, the back round starts in the first round.
"
Sepheo se tlwaelehileng sa teko ke sefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho fedisa kgopolo-taba e le nngwe kapa ho feta**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...teko ke tlhahlobo e sebediswang ho fedisa dikgopolo-taba e le nngwe kapa tse ngata..."" This directly defines the typical scientific test.

While options B, C, and D are related to the scientific method, they don't define the *test* itself. The test is the act of testing a hypothesis to resolve a question or problem.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e sa thuseng ho tataisa dipatlisiso tsa mahlale?","The correct answer is **A: Mokgwa wa mahlale feela (Just the scientific method)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what *doesn't* help guide scientific investigations.** The provided text states that the scientific method *does* guide scientific inquiry.
* **The other options *do* help:**
    * **B: Ho fana ka ditlhaloso (Providing definitions):** Clear definitions are crucial for understanding the concepts being investigated.
    * **C: Ho fedisa menahano e ka bang teng (Eliminating potential biases):**  Minimizing bias is essential for objective and reliable results.
    * **D: Ho etsa diteko (Conducting experiments):** Experiments are a core part of testing hypotheses and gathering evidence.

Therefore, limiting oneself *only* to the scientific method, without incorporating definitions, addressing biases, and conducting experiments, would *not* effectively guide scientific investigations.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e mabapi le mahodiotswana eo e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Boholo ba mahodiotswana a nka dihora tse fetang dihora tse tharo.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Diphesente tse pedi tsa difefo tse matla tse mabifi haholo di nka nako e fetang dihora tse tharo."" (Two percent of the strongest tornadoes take over three hours.) This means *not* the majority.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Mahodiotswana a kgona ho senya ntho e nngwe le e nngwe e haufi le ona:** The text explicitly says, ""Difefo tse matla di ka senya ntho e nngwe le e nngwe e leng tseleng ya tsona."" (Strong tornadoes can damage anything in their path.)
* **B: Mahodiotswana a otla dibaka tse nyane ho feta difefo tse ding:** The text says, ""Mahodiotswana a otla dibaka tse nyane empa di ka senya ntho e nngwe le e nngwe e leng tseleng ya tsona."" (Tornadoes damage small areas but can damage anything in their path.) This implies they damage smaller areas than other types of storms.
* **D: Mahodiotswana a mang a ka ba le meya ya dikhilomithara tse 300 ka hora:** The text states, ""Mahodiotswana a mang a ka ba le moya o fokang o ka bang 480 km/h..."" (Some tornadoes can have a descending wind of up to 480 km/h...)  This confirms some tornadoes can reach that speed.



Therefore, option C is the only statement that contradicts the provided information.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo boholo ba mahodiotswana?","The correct answer is **B: Di bopa meya e ka bang ya dikhilomithara tse 480 ka hora**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Difefo tsena tse mabifi di na le moya o fokang o ka bang 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)."" This directly translates to the tornadoes can travel at speeds of around 480 km/h.
* **Option B reflects this speed.**
* **Option A** is only partially correct, as while some tornadoes *can* last over 3 hours, the text focuses on their speed.
* **Option C** is not mentioned or implied in the text. The text talks about *damage* they cause, not their size compared to other tornadoes.
* **Option D** is mentioned in the text but not in a way that directly addresses their overall size. It talks about them lifting cars, which is a consequence of their power, not a description of their size.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo batho ba qadileng ho e etsa lekgolong la bo-16 la dilemo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho etsa dibonela-hole**.

The passage states that realistic viewing holes were first created in Europe towards the end of the 16th century. These viewing holes used a system of two lenses to make distant objects appear closer and larger. Therefore, the correct answer is that people commonly made viewing holes at that time.
"
Ke nako e kae batho ba hodisa dintho ka dilense?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho tloha qetellong ya lekgolo la bo-16 la dilemo**.

The passage states: ""Batho ba ntse ba etsa le ho sebedisa dilense ho hodisa ponahalo ya dintho dilemo tse dikete-kete. Le ha ho le jwalo, dibonela-hole tsa nnete tsa ho qala di entswe Europe qetellong ya lekgolo la bo16 la dilemo."" (People have always been doing and using lenses to make distant things appear closer. However, the first true telescopes were created in Europe at the end of the 16th century.)
"
"Ho latela seratswana, lehaha la Muhammad le reng ka ditlwaelo tsa hae tsa moya kapa ditekanyetso?","The correct answer is **C: O ne a hloka nako e nyane haholo a le mong.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hang ha o kene ka lehaheng lena, o tla be o le mong ka ho feletseng."" (Once you enter this cave, you will be completely alone.) This highlights the need for solitude and being alone, which suggests he needed time for spiritual reflection and connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ananela kgotso le ho behwa ka thoko** (He sought refuge and was placed securely) - While the cave provided security, the passage focuses on his spiritual practice within it, not just the refuge itself.
*   **B: Lerata le ka ntle le ka thusa ho nahana** (The outside can help with thinking) - The passage explicitly describes the cave as being isolated and conducive to internal reflection, not external stimuli.
*   **D: O ne a labalabela ho bonwa le ho utluwa** (He was seeking to be seen and heard) - The passage states the opposite – he sought solitude and was completely alone.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, tshepe e ile ya sebediswa bakeng sa eng pele?","The correct answer is **D: Diporo** (Piers).

The text states: ""Metheo ya seporo ile ya thehwa kgale hore ho tswharwe diporo di tiye."" This translates to: ""The concept of a pier was invented long ago to support the pillars.""  The passage then goes on to describe how the shape of the pillars evolved, eventually leading to the use of iron plates. Therefore, the iron plate was initially used to improve the **piers (diporo)**.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke hobaneng ha mabidi a lehong a ile a nkelwa sebaka ke mabidi a tshepe?","The correct answer is **D: A ne a qetwa ke tshepe seporong** (They were destroyed by the screw in the hinge).

The passage states: ""Qetellong, mabili a mapolanka a ile a nkelwa sebaka ke mabili a tshepe. Ka 1767, seporo sa tshepe hohle sa ho qala se ile sa thehwa.""  This translates to: ""Finally, the wooden pegs were replaced by screw pegs. In 1767, the entire screw hinge began to be used.""  The passage also mentions that the wooden pegs were destroying the wooden pegs (""sena se ile sa senya mabili a mapolanka a dikariki"" - this damaged the wooden pegs of the hinge). So, the pegs were being destroyed by the screw in the hinge.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e neng e susumetsa batho nakong ya Romanticism?","The correct answer is **D: Setso**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tabeng ya Romanticism, dibaka di ile tsa susumetsa dikelello tsa batho, mme ha nako e ntse e feta ho ile ha hlahella meetlo le setso tse amanang le sebaka seo..."" This translates to: ""In the context of Romanticism, places influenced people's experiences, and over time customs and traditions related to that place emerged..."" The passage further emphasizes that belonging to a place and its traditions was more beneficial than following imposed laws.

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that **setso (customs/traditions)** was what motivated people during the Romanticism period.
"
Dipolelong tse latelang ke dife tse sa bontsheng kgopolo e akaretsang ya ho iketsetsa diqeto tsa determinism ya tekhenoloji? ,"The correct answer is **A: Diphello tsa theknoloji setjhabeng di itshetlehile ka maemo a bophelo.**

Here's why:

* **Technological determinism** argues that technology shapes society. Option A, stating that the effects of technology on society are independent of living conditions, directly contradicts this core idea. Technological determinism would argue that living conditions *are* shaped by technology.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with technological determinism:

* **B: Tswelo pele ya theknoloji ha e susumetswe ke setso:** This supports technological determinism because it suggests that technology follows its own internal logic and isn't driven by cultural factors.
* **C: Theknoloji e na le diphello tsa tlhaho setjhabeng:**  Technological determinism posits that technology has inherent impacts on society, like a natural force.
* **D: Tswelo pele ya theknoloji ha ya thehwa tshusumetsong ya dipolotiki:** This aligns with technological determinism by suggesting technology progresses independently of political influence.



Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't reflect the core tenets of technological determinism."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e sa amaneng le ho hula seqha?","The correct answer is **A: Modumo o bonolo (Simple shape)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the difference between ""up bow"" and ""down bow"" handshapes in music. 

* **Up bow:** Creates a clear, bright sound.
* **Down bow:** Creates a strong, rich sound.

The options B, C, and D all directly relate to the described characteristics of the ""up bow"" and ""down bow"" techniques:

* **B: Letshwao le shebahalang jwalo ka sesupo (A shape like a bow):** This describes the visual shape of the hand, which is key to understanding the bowing technique.
* **C: Modumo o matla (Strong sound):**  This is the characteristic sound produced by the ""down bow"".
* **D: Ho qala ka senqanqane (Starting small):**  This refers to the starting position for the ""down bow"".

**""Modumo o bonolo"" (Simple shape)** is a general description of a handshape and not a specific characteristic related to the *sound* produced by the bowing technique, which is the main focus of the passage. Therefore, it doesn't fit with the information given.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e amanang le modumo o bonolo?","The correct answer is **C: Letshwao le shebahalang jwalo ka-V**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the ""up bow"" resembles a ""V"" shape and produces a light, clear sound.
* The ""down bow"" resembles a staple or square with a bottom corner and produces a strong and resonant sound.

Therefore, the ""up bow"" (V shape) corresponds to a simpler, lighter sound.
"
Mesaletsa ya dintho tsa kgale e bontsha hore matsoho a ile a qetella a ikamahanya le maemo hore a sebediswe haholo-holo bakeng sa se latelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Motsamao**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Masapo a matsoho mesaletseng ya dintho tsa kgale a dilemo di dimilione tse pedi ho isa ho dimilione tse tharo a bontsha phetoho ya tsela ya ho sebedisetsa letsoho, ha a sa sebedisetswa motsamao empa a sebedisetswa ho tshwara."" This directly indicates that the fossil record shows hands evolving for manipulation.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo masapo a menwana a chimpanzi? ,"The correct answer is **A: A otlolohile ho feta a batho**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Letsoho la motho le lekgutshwane ho feta leoto, mme **masapo a menwana a batla a otlolohile**.""  This directly indicates that chimpanzee bones are more elongated than human bones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matsoho le maoto a tsona a fapane ka boholo:** The passage states they are *equal* in size and length, implying they *are* used for climbing.
* **C: A sebedisetswa ho jara boima ba mmele:** While chimpanzees *do* use their arms for climbing, the primary point is about the shape of the bones.
* **D: A sebeliswa haholo-holo bakeng sa ho tsamaisa dintho:** The passage focuses on the shift in arm use for climbing, not for carrying objects.



"
Kgetho e tlosa phapang e ntjha ya diphatsa tsa lefutso ho tswa letamong lefe?,"The correct answer is **C: Karohano**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Karohano le poelano di isa phetoho pele le morao pakeng tsa dihlopha tse pedi molokong ka mong.""  This translates to: ""Reasoning and planning lead to change forward and backward between the two groups in the same place.""

This directly indicates that **reasoning** (Karohano) is the driving force behind the emergence of a new type of genie.
"
Ke tshebetso efe e ikarabellang bakeng sa ho eketsa phapang ya diphatsa tsa lefutso?,"The correct answer is **C: Phetoho**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Phetoho ya tsona e eketsa mofuta o motjha o fapaneng wa dijini..."" (This change adds a new type of genie...).  The word ""phetoho"" directly translates to ""change"" in English. The passage emphasizes that a *change* occurred that led to a new type of genie.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Karohano (Separation/Division):**  While the passage mentions separation, the *change* is the primary factor leading to the new genie type.
*   **B: Ho kopanya hape (Recombination/Joining together):** The passage describes a divergence, not joining.
*   **D: Hlahisitswe (Published/Issued):** This is irrelevant to the biological process described.



Therefore, **Phetoho (Change)** is the most accurate answer because it directly relates to the creation of a new type of genie with different intellectual capabilities."
"Ho latela boitsebiso bo serapeng, ke efe ho tsee eo tshwene e lokelang ho e ja ho rarolla “bothata ba protheine”?","The correct answer is **C: Ditsiyane (Insects)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that early primates solved the ""protein problem"" by eating insects. The passage also mentions that insects are rich in protein and contain all the necessary amino acids. Therefore, based on the text, insects are the food source that early primates likely utilized to overcome their protein deficiency.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mathata afe ho a latelang a sa bakweng ke khaello ya di-amino acid tsa bohlokwa?","The correct answer is **D: Lefu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ho hloleha ho etsa jwalo ho na le ditlamorao tse bosula: ho hola ka monyebe, ho se fepehe hantle le ho qetella ka lefu.""  This directly links the lack of essential amino acids to death.
"
Ditho tsa mofuta o itseng wa setso hangata di bontsha ho kopana ha tsona le sehlopha jwang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka ho leka ho kopanya le ba bang** (By trying to connect with others).

Here's why:

The text states that small communities bring together people who think and feel similarly, and offer a sense of belonging. This belonging is achieved by *connecting with others* who share similar characteristics.  The text also highlights shared values, customs, language, and behavior as key elements of a small community.  All of these facilitate connection and belonging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka ho amohela ditumelo tsa bohle ba potolohileng** (By accepting the beliefs of all those who are marginalized): While accepting diverse beliefs *could* exist within a community, it isn't the primary driver of the community's formation as described in the text. The text focuses on shared characteristics, not necessarily accepting all beliefs.
* **C: Ka ho amohela ditlwaelo tsa setjhaba** (By accepting national customs): Small communities often have customs that differ from national ones. The text emphasizes the *specific* customs within the small community, not acceptance of national customs.
* **D: Ka ho sebedisa setaele jwalo ka mofuta wa tshwantshetso** (By using a pattern in the same way as a type of pattern): This option is too vague and doesn't directly address the formation of the community based on shared characteristics and connection.



Therefore, option A accurately reflects the information provided in the text."
"Ho ya ka kgopolo e fanweng serapeng sena, ho ka nna ha etsahalang ka ngwana ya ikamahanyang le sehlotshwana sa morabe seo ho nkwang hore se na le boitshwaro bo kotsi?","The best answer is **B: Ho ka etsahala hore ngwana a kenelle boitshwarong bo kotsi.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that when a child is teased for having a small penis, it can negatively impact their behavior, potentially leading to difficulties in school.
* This suggests that the child might try to compensate for the perceived weakness by engaging in risky behaviors as a way to prove themselves or gain attention.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ngwana o tla leka ho qoba ho kopanela boitshwarong bo kotsi:** While possible, the passage focuses on the negative impact of teasing, suggesting a *potential* risk-taking behavior rather than a conscious attempt to engage in it.
* **C: Ngwana o tla ikgula maemong a setjhaba:**  This is not directly supported by the passage. While low self-esteem *might* lead to this, it's not the primary consequence mentioned.
* **D: Ngwana o tla hana ho ikopanya le merabe e meng e menyenyane:** The passage doesn't mention anything about aversion to other small penises.  The focus is on the impact of *being teased* for a small penis.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate interpretation of the potential consequence described in the passage."
"Ho ya ka seratswana sena, tsebo ya ngwana ya maikutlo a merabe e ka ba le tshusumetso ho efe ho tse latelang?","The correct answer is **B: Boitshwaro ba bona**.

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding how to recognize and manage the causes of a small stomach can impact a child's behavior. The example given directly links a child who identifies with a small stomach and performs poorly in school to the fact that they haven't learned how to manage their stomach's function. This clearly demonstrates an impact on their behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Sehlotshwana sa merabe seo ba kgethang ho ikamahanya le sona:** While related, the passage focuses on *understanding* the stomach, not just the child's association with it.
* **C: Dikamano tsa bona le bana ba bang:**  While a child's understanding of their body can *indirectly* affect relationships, the passage directly links it to *their own* behavior and performance.
* **D: Tlhaloso ya bona ya morabe:**  The passage suggests that their understanding is incomplete (they haven't learned to manage it), but the core impact is on how they *act* because of that understanding (or lack thereof).



Therefore, **Boitshwaro ba bona** (Their behavior) is the most direct and accurate consequence mentioned in the passage.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho e latelang eo ho ka etsahalang hore ebe e ke ya lumellana le kgodiso ya ngwana ya hlaha?","The correct answer is **C: Ditlwaelo tse kgelohileng (Traumatic experiences)**.

Here's why:

The passage details how neglect and abandonment, often coupled with abuse, can severely impact a child's development, leading to them becoming ""untamed"" or wild.  It specifically mentions traumatic events like being abandoned, abused, or even raised by animals.

**Traumatic experiences** directly contradict the healthy development of a child's sense of self and their ability to form appropriate social and emotional attachments. They can create lasting psychological damage that makes it difficult for a child to function normally.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ho phela ka boikemelo (Living independently):** While challenging, living independently *can* be a positive development, especially for a child who has overcome adversity. It demonstrates resilience.
* **B: Tsebo e matla ya ho qoqa (Strong ability to reason):** Reasoning skills are valuable, but they don't negate the impact of early trauma.  A child can be intelligent and still struggle with emotional and behavioral issues stemming from a traumatic past.
* **D: Matshwenyeho a setjhaba (Social stigma):** Social stigma is a consequence of being ""untamed"" or having a difficult past. It doesn't *cause* the disconnect between a child's instincts and healthy development.  It's a reaction to it.



Therefore, **C: Ditlwaelo tse kgelohileng (Traumatic experiences)** is the most directly related factor that would likely prevent a ""hlaha"" (wild/untamed) child from developing in a healthy, expected way.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo boitshwaro bo hlahla ba bana?","The correct answer is **B: Boitshwaro bo hlaha bo ka bakwa ke ho hloka botswalle.**

Here's why:

The text explains that ""bana ba sa laoleheng"" (abandoned children) often exhibit behaviors similar to animals. It mentions being raised by animals, or living among them. The text also notes that abandonment can stem from parents being mentally or physically incapacitated.

While the text touches on various reasons for abandonment (negligence, death, being raised by animals), it highlights a key element: the *lack of social interaction/peers*.  Children deprived of human connection are more likely to develop behaviors influenced by instinct and survival, similar to animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bongata ba boitshwaro bo hlaha bo bakwa ke ho holofala mmeleng** (The extent of behavior arises from physical development) - While physical development plays a role, it's not the primary driver of the *animalistic* behaviors described. The text focuses more on the impact of social deprivation.

*   **C: Boitshwaro bo hlaha bo atile feela ho bana ba kwaletsweng ke batswadi ba bona** (Behavior only arises in children abandoned by their parents) - The text indicates that abandonment isn't the only cause; neglect can also lead to similar behaviors.

*   **D: Boitshwaro bohle bo hlaha bo bakwa ke bokowa bo matla ba kelello** (All behavior arises from strong mental trauma) - While trauma can contribute, the text suggests instinct and lack of social interaction play a significant role in shaping these behaviors.



Therefore, option B best encapsulates the reason behind the animalistic behaviors observed in abandoned children, as described in the text."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mekgwa efe ho e latelang e sa tsamaellaneng le temo ya ho iphedisa?","The correct answer is **C: Ho tsepamisa maikutlo ho tjhai e ngata ho fapana le mekgwa e tswetseng pele.**

Here's why:

* **Temo e nyane** (subsistence farming) is about producing *just enough* food to feed the family. It's not about generating surplus for sale or focusing on high yields.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with subsistence farming:

* **A: Ho tsepamisa maikutlo hodima tjhai e kgotsofatsang ditlhoko tsa lelapa la molemi:**  This directly aligns with the core principle of subsistence farming - providing for the family's needs.
* **B: Ho hlahisa dijo ho rekisetsa ba bang:** While subsistence farming is primarily for self-sufficiency, some surplus might be sold, making this option plausible.
* **D: Ho fumana peo sebakeng sa molemi:**  Utilizing local knowledge and adapting to the environment is a key characteristic of subsistence farming.

Option C, however, is about *increasing* food production *beyond* what's needed for the family, which contradicts the fundamental idea of subsistence farming.  It implies aiming for surplus and potentially competing with established agricultural practices, which is not the goal of a subsistence farmer.

Ke efe ho tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo mokgwa wa ho iphedisa ka temo?,"The correct answer is **B: E sebedisa mekgwa e ikgethang ho eketsa dijalo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Temo e nyane ke mokgwa o bonolo, wa tlhaho, o sebedisang peo ya sebaka seo e bolokilweng e dumellanang le maemo a tikoloho ebe selemo le selemo ho fetolwa dijalo *kana ho sebediswa mekgwa e meng e batlang e le bonolo ho eketsa tjhai*."" This directly translates to using different methods to increase yields.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ke tsamaiso ya tlhahiso ya dijo ka ho feletseng:** While a complete food production system might *include* a small-scale farming approach, it's not the definition of it.
* **C: E dumella ditsebi tsa temo ho arolelana dijalo tsa bona ho pholletsa le sebaka sa bona:**  This refers to knowledge sharing, not the practice of small-scale farming itself.
* **D: E ntse e sebediswa ke bo ra dipolase dinaheng tse ding:** The passage mentions it's been used historically and in many developing countries, but this doesn't define *what* it is.



"
Ho etela musiamo ho tla wela tlasa mofuta ofe wa bohahlaudi?,"The answer is **B: Bohahlaudi ba boithabiso (Leisure Tourism)**.

Here's why:

* The passage defines ""bohahlaudi ba boikgathollo"" (leisure tourism) as travel for relaxation and recreation.
* Visiting a mountain is typically done for enjoyment, exercise, and a break from routine – all characteristics of leisure tourism.
* The other options don't fit as well:
    * **Bohahlaudi ba kgwebo (Business Tourism):** Travel for work-related purposes.
    * **Bohahlaudi ba setso (Cultural Tourism):**  Travel focused on experiencing the culture and history of a place. While a mountain *could* have cultural significance, the primary reason for visiting is usually not cultural exploration.
    * **Bohahlaudi ba kantle (Adventure Tourism):** While mountain climbing *can* be adventure tourism, the passage defines leisure tourism more broadly and visiting a mountain for general enjoyment falls under that category.



"
"Ho latela seratswana sena, ke eng e ka nnang ya e-ba ntho e tlang pele ho baeti ba boithabiso?","The correct answer is **D: Ho utlwisisa nalane ya sebaka (To understand the history of the place)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Haeba sepheo sa motho sa ho etela sebaka se itseng ke ho tseba histori le setso sa yona jwale mofuta wa bohahlaudi bona bo tsejwa e le bohahlaudi ba setso."" (If a person's motive for visiting a certain place is to know its history and culture, then this type of tourism is recognized as cultural tourism.)

This directly indicates that understanding the history is a primary reason for cultural tourism. While the other options *might* be part of the experience, the text explicitly links understanding history to the *type* of tourism being cultural.

Ke eng e bolelwang serapeng e le ntho e thusitseng ho fokotsa tshabo ya phetoho ka hare ho kereke ya lehae?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho hopola mehlala e atlehileng ya boitshwaro ba borakgwebo.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tabeng ena, ho hopola makgetlo a feteleng a ho itshwara ha rakhoebo le katleho e bileng teng ho thusitse batho ho bula diphetoho tse ntjha le mehato e metjha ya kereke ya sebakeng seo.""  This directly links remembering successful business endeavors to reducing fear of change.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ho fumana temohisiso ka batho ba ileng ba susumetsa setso sa mokgatlo:** While helpful for understanding the psyche, the passage focuses more on the *examples of success* rather than just understanding the psychology behind leadership.
* **C: Ho sibolla matla a kgannang mokgatlo:**  The passage doesn't mention consciously channeling emotional energy.
* **D: Ho utlwisisa nalane ya mokgatlo:**  Understanding the history is mentioned, but the *examples of success* are highlighted as the more powerful tool for overcoming fear of change.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho utlwisisa histori ya motho ho ka thusa ka eng?","The correct answer is **A: Ho fokotsa tshabo ya phetoho.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Tabeng ena, ho hopola makgetlo a feteleng a ho itshwara ha rakhoebo le katleho e bileng teng ho thusitse batho ho bula diphetoho tse ntjha le mehato e metjha ya kereke ya sebakeng seo. Ditaba tse jwalo tsa katleho di fokoditse ho tshaba phetoho, e be di etsa hore batho ba be le mohopolo o mo ntle wa phetoho nakong e tlang.""  This directly links remembering past successes to reducing the fear of change.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ho matlafatsa ditekanyetso:** While understanding history can inform values, the text doesn't primarily focus on strengthening values.
* **C: Ho fumana maikutlo a sebaka ka hare ho mokgatlo:**  The text discusses understanding the history *within* the mind but doesn't frame it as finding a sense of belonging.
* **D: Ho ntlafatsa boitshwaro ba borakgwebo:** While this *could* be a result, the text focuses more broadly on the psychological impact of understanding history, not specifically on business acumen.



"
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo mokgwa wa ho ithuta wa morao-rao?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho ithuta ho lokela ho tsepamiswa dinthong tseo re dumelang hore di tla re etsahalla.**

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes that people often watch educational TV shows without ever applying what they learn. This suggests that learning is most effective when it's relevant to one's life and potential future experiences. 
* Option B directly reflects this idea: learning is most impactful when focused on things we anticipate encountering or needing to do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Diphihlelo tse ding tsa ho ithuta di molemo ho feta tse ding:** While this might be true, the passage doesn't focus on comparing different learning styles.
* **C: Mekgwa e meng ya ho ithuta e molemo ho feta e meng:**  Again, the passage doesn't discuss the effectiveness of different *methods* of learning, only the relevance of the *topic*.
* **D: Ha ho na botlalo thutong:** This statement is too broad and doesn't capture the core argument of the passage, which is about the *application* of learning.



"
Ke efe ya dipolelo tse latelang e sa bontsheng mokgwa wa ho ithuta wa morao-rao?,"The correct answer is **D: Tsebo eo mohlomong le ka mohla re ke keng ra e sebedisa e ntse e le molemo ho ithuta.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that learning isn't just about acquiring knowledge, but about the interaction *between* the learner and the information.**  It criticizes passively watching TV programs that teach skills we won't actually use.

* **Option D directly reflects this criticism.** It points out that learning knowledge we won't apply is ineffective learning. The passage argues against learning for the sake of learning *without* the intention of using the learned skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho na le mekgwa e mengata ya ho ithuta ditaba** - This is a general statement about learning methods and isn't inherently contradictory to the passage.
* **B: Boiphihlelo bo itseng ba ho ithuta bo lokela ho behwa pele ho bo bong** - This relates to the learner's perspective and the importance of their own engagement, which aligns with the passage.
* **C: Boiphihlelo ba ho ithuta bo itshetlehile hodima moithuti le tsebo e hlahisitsweng** - This is the central idea of the passage; learning is a dynamic process between the learner and the information.



Therefore, option D is the only one that *doesn't* represent a learning method advocated by the passage; it highlights a passive and ultimately ineffective way of learning.

"Ka mora ho tsoha ka boomo nakong ya nako e tlwaelehileng ya ho robala, ke efe ho tsee e neng e ka kenakenana le tshebetso ya ho sitisa boroko?","The correct answer is **B: Ho sebedisa ntlwana le ho kgutlela betheng**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where someone wakes up briefly during the night and then struggles to fall back asleep. Option B, ""Ho sebedisa ntlwana le ho kgutlela betheng"" (Using a fan and returning to bed), is specifically mentioned as a way to encourage the person to wake up and eventually fall back asleep. The passage states: ""Haeba o iphumana o seta watjhe hape o ntse o robetse, e ka behwa ka lehlakoreng le leng la kamoreng le leng se tla o qobella ho tsoha hore o ilo e tima."" (If you find yourself awake again, it can be placed in another corner of the room that will make you wake up and eventually fall asleep.) A fan is a common way to achieve this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho bala hora le halofo pele o robala hape** (Reading an hour and a half before going to sleep again):  This is likely to *delay* sleep, not help with the problem of waking up briefly.
*   **C: Ho tima alamo setulong sa hao sa bosiu ebe o robala hape metsotso e mashome a mabedi hamorao** (Turning on your bedside lamp and going back to sleep after twenty minutes): While this is a common recommendation for people who wake up briefly, it's not explicitly mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Ho tsoha ho ya nwa metsi ka botlolo setulong sa hao sa bosiu** (Getting up to drink water at night): The passage actually lists drinking water as a *contributing factor* to waking up, not a solution. (""Ho sitisa boroko"" - waking up briefly - is linked to things like drinking water).



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng tlhaloso e nepahetseng ya tshitiso ya boroko?,"The correct answer is **A: E ka thehwa ho biorhythm**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes sleep inertia as a temporary state of impaired performance after waking up.** It focuses on the immediate aftermath of waking, not on long-term cycles like biorhythms. Biorhythms are a theory about cyclical biological patterns, and while they might *influence* sleep patterns, sleep inertia isn't *caused* by them according to the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate descriptions of sleep inertia based on the text:

* **B: Sepheo ke ho se tsohe ka botlalo** - The passage states ""Sena se ka etswa habonolo ka ho sebedisa watjhe e batlang e kgutsitse hore e o phaphamise ntle le hore e o tsose ka ho feletseng."" (This can be easily done by using an alarm that wakes you up without fully waking you). This means you don't fully wake up immediately.
* **C: Mokgwa ona o etsahala nakong hya ho robala ha hao ho tlwaelehileng** -  The passage says ""Mokgwa ona o etsahala nakong hya ho robala ha hao ho tlwaelehileng"" (This happens during your regular sleep).  Sleep inertia is linked to the disruption of a regular sleep cycle.
* **D: Ka mora ho tsoha, sepheo ke ho kgutlela borokong ka mora dihora tse pedi** - While not explicitly stated, the passage mentions that drinking coffee or tea before bed can help you wake up and suggests you'll be more likely to get up and have a coffee/tea after getting up. The text implies that the inertia will subside within a couple of hours.



"
"Ha boko bo ntse bo leka ho lora ka mokgwa o hlakileng kgafetsa, ho eketswa eng?","The correct answer is **A: Palo ya maemo a REM**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the problem is often linked to a *lack of REM sleep*.  It specifically mentions that if someone has insufficient REM sleep at night, their body might react unusually.  Therefore, the number of REM cycles is the key factor being discussed.

The other options are less directly related to the core problem described:

*   **B: Maemo a matla (Stage 3 sleep):** While important for deep sleep, the passage focuses on REM sleep.
*   **C: Bolelele ba boemo ba ho hlaphohelwa (Slow-wave sleep):** Again, important, but not the central issue mentioned.
*   **D: Nako dipakeng tsa maemo a REM (Time between REM stages):** While the timing of REM cycles *could* be a factor, the passage directly points to *insufficient REM cycles* as the primary issue.



"
Ke ditshusumetso dife ho tse latelang tse mpe tse ka bang mmeleng khafetsa ha o lora?,"The correct answer is **B: REM e fokotsehile ka bosiu bo bong.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the phenomenon described (feeling like you've been awake for a long time after sleeping) is often linked to **reduced REM sleep**.  The passage explicitly mentions ""ditoro tseo motho a ikutlwang ho tsona e leng se eketsang nako pakeng tsa boemo ba ho robala o ntse o panyapanya (kapa REM)"".  If REM sleep is insufficient, the body's natural sleep cycles are disrupted, leading to the feeling of not fully resting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho fokotseha ha nako dipakeng tsa maemo a REM:** While related, the key issue isn't necessarily the *time* between REM episodes, but the *amount* of REM sleep overall.
*   **C: Ho itshetleha ka toro e hlakileng:**  This is the opposite of the problem.  The passage describes *not* feeling rested.
*   **D: Ho eketseha ha REM ka bosiu bo bong:** This is also the opposite of the described problem. More REM sleep would generally be associated with feeling more rested.

"Ho latela seratswana, dihlopha tse tlwaelehileng le dihlopha tsa sebele di tshwana jwang?","The correct answer is **C: Dihlopha ka bobedi di tlalehela sehlopha sa batsamaisi se sa bonahaleng**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""“Sehlopha se sa bonahaleng” ke sehlopha se laolang seo ditho ka ding di tlalehang ho sona. Sehlopha se sa bonahaleng se beha ditekanyetso tsa setho ka seng."" This means both regular and computer groups report to an invisible management group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dihlopha tseo ka bobedi di lebelletswe ho bapala maemong a tshwanang:** The text doesn't mention any expectation of equal roles. In fact, computer groups often have a greater number of members and their interactions are less predictable.
* **B: Dihlopha ka bobedi di na le maemo a fapaneng a boikemelo mekgweng ya bona ya letsatsi le letsatsi:** The text implies that computer groups have a degree of autonomy through the ""invisible management group,"" but doesn't say they have *different* levels of autonomy.
* **D: Dihlopha ka bobedi di sebetsa sebakeng se le seng sa nako:** While computer groups operate across time (through reports), the text doesn't make a direct comparison to regular groups operating in a single time frame.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e mabapi le dihlopha tse kopanang ka k’homputha le ka sebele eo e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Nako e fapaneng ya dibaka e ka thusa dihlopha tse kopanang ka k’homputha.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ho ba teng ha “sehlopha se sa bonahaleng” sa nnete (Larson le LaFasto, 1989, p109) e boetse e le karolo e kgethehileng ya sehlopha sa k’homputa. “Sehlopha se sa bonahaleng” ke sehlopha se laolang seo ditho ka ding di tlalehang ho sona. Sehlopha se sa bonahaleng se beha ditekanyetso tsa setho ka seng. **Nako e fapaneng ya dibaka e ka thusa dihlopha tse kopanang ka k’homputha**"".  This directly addresses the question about what's true regarding computer-mediated groups. The ""invisible group"" aspect allows for interaction across different times and locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dihlopha tse tlwaelehileng hangata di tshwarwa ka maemo a hodimo:** The text doesn't say anything about the hierarchy of traditional groups.
*   **B: Dihlopha tse kopanang ka k’homputha hangata di sebetsa e le sebaka sa ho ikopanya le dihlopha tse tlwaelehileng:** The text states that computer-mediated groups are *different* from traditional groups, not a place for them to meet.
*   **C: Dihlopha tse tlwaelehileng di na le boipuso bo fokolang ho feta dihlopha tse kpanang ka k’homputha:**  The text doesn't compare the level of intimacy between the two types of groups.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on fundamental human needs and motivations, particularly those that develop throughout life.** It highlights how individuals grow and develop expectations as they mature.
*   **Options B, C, and D directly relate to the core concepts of motivation theories discussed:**
    *   **B (How the environment influences behavior):** This aligns with the idea that external factors shape people's choices.
    *   **C (Inner needs):**  This relates to Maslow's hierarchy, which emphasizes physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization needs.
    *   **D (Understanding what people want):** This is central to understanding their motivations and desires.
*   **A (New fulfilled aspirations as an adult):** While people *do* have aspirations as adults, the passage's main emphasis is on foundational needs and expectations established *during* development and throughout life, not necessarily on *newly* fulfilled aspirations *after* adulthood. It's not a primary focus of the described motivation theories.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng ntho ya rule of third?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho theha bophelo le matla ka hara senepe** (To create life and energy within the frame).

Here's why:

* **Rule of Thirds** is specifically about dividing the frame into thirds and placing key elements along those lines or at the intersections. It's a compositional guideline for balance and visual interest.

Let's break down why the other options *are* related to the rule of thirds:

* **A: Ho theha motheo wa moo taba e ka behwang teng** (To compose the core of where the subject can be placed) - The rule of thirds helps you determine *where* to place the subject, which is a core part of composition.
* **C: Ho boloka taba sebakeng se itseng le se sebetsang hantle** (To keep the subject in a certain place and functioning well) -  Placement within the frame, guided by the rule of thirds, contributes to a subject being well-positioned.
* **D: Ho theha taelo ka hara senepe** (To create direction within the frame) - The lines of the rule of thirds can be used to create visual pathways and direct the viewer's eye through the image.

Option B, focusing on ""life and energy"" within the frame, is a more general compositional concept and not directly tied to the specific grid structure of the rule of thirds. It's a broader principle of good photography.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng mokgwa wa ho nka dinepe wa 35mm?,"The correct answer is **C: E na le karolo e fapaneng ya dikarolo ho feta dijithale tse ngata tse tlwaelehileng** (It has a different aspect ratio than most common digital ones).

Here's why:

* **A: E ntse e hlahiswa (It is still produced):** The text explicitly states ""Se ntse se etswa le kajeno"" (It is still made today).
* **B: E amohetswe ke dijithale tsa khamera ya dijithale (It is accepted by digital cameras):** The text says ""ntlha ya bohlokwa ke hore rashio ya sona e keneletse ho difomate tsa sensara ya senepe sa khamera ya dijithale"" (the important thing is that its ratio fits the formats of digital camera sensors).
* **D: Ke fomate e tsebahalang haholo lefatsheng (It is a very well-known format worldwide):**  The text implies this by mentioning its historical significance and its influence on aspect ratios used today.

* **C: E na le karolo e fapaneng ya dikarolo ho feta dijithale tse ngata tse tlwaelehileng (It has a different aspect ratio than most common digital ones):** This is the *definition* of the 35mm aspect ratio. The text emphasizes this by providing the aspect ratio calculation (3.2) and comparing it to APS-C and other formats. This is what the question asks about – what is *not* explained about how the 35mm format works.  The other options describe aspects *explained* in the text.



Therefore, option C is the best answer because it describes a key characteristic of the 35mm format that the text elaborates on, but the question asks what is *not* explained.  The text provides the aspect ratio and its relation to digital sensors, making the contrast with other digital formats a core part of its description.

"Ho latela seratswana, ha bahlahisi ba ntse ba eketsa boleng ba tlhahiso ya lense, dilense tsa zoom di ntlafaditswe jwang?","The correct answer is **C: Boleng ba tsona ba dinepe bo tshwana le ba dilense tse nang le bolelele bo tsitsitseng.**

Here's why:

The passage states that a problem with zoom lenses is that their high zoom range often compromises image quality.  However, the question asks how zoom lenses have been improved *according to the text*.  The text implies that manufacturers are working to overcome this by improving the quality of the lens elements themselves, making them comparable to prime lenses. Options A and D are incorrect because the passage states that high zoom ranges often *reduce* image quality, not increase it. Option B is not mentioned in the text. Therefore, C is the most logical inference based on the provided text.



"
"Ho ipapisitswe le tlhaiso-leseding e serapeng, ke neng moo lense ya zoom e ka bang molemo ho feta lense e kgolo?","The correct answer is **A: Haeba lesoba le phahameng ke lona le tlang pele.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that zoom lenses allow manufacturers to reach higher focal lengths than prime lenses.** This is a key advantage.
* **The question asks when a zoom lens would be *better* than a prime lens.**  If you need to zoom in on distant subjects (like wildlife or sports) where the subject is far away (high focal length), a zoom lens is essential. 
* **Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the passage.**  While zoom lenses have drawbacks (like potentially lower maximum apertures), the primary benefit highlighted is their ability to achieve longer focal lengths.  The passage doesn't mention the specific benefit of being able to get closer to subjects, or needing to use flash, or the complexity of the lens.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya nkwa e le tlhaloso e nepahetseng ya tumelo ya sephiri sa moya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho na le taba ya ho ba le kgotso le maemo a monate a kelello (There is a matter of having faith and elevated mental states)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Sephiri sa moya as a continuous seeking of connection with the divine.** It emphasizes a feeling, intuition, or understanding of the divine, not necessarily a state of *having* faith or elevated mental states. 
* **Options B, C, and D align with the passage's description.**  The passage states that Sephiri sa moya involves seeking understanding, using methods to enhance spiritual connection, and that it's a way to achieve a feeling of divine presence.  These options all describe aspects of that seeking and connection.

Therefore, option A deviates from the core concept of continuous seeking and feeling described in the passage, making it the incorrect definition of Sephiri sa moya.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng taba ya tumelo ya saphiri sa moya?","The correct answer is **B: Ho phehella temohisiso ka diphihlelo tse arolelanwang, tsa setjhaba.**

Here's why:

* **Saphiri sa moya (Spiritual Sapphire)**, as described in the passage, is about a deep, unending connection with the divine, characterized by feelings of bliss, intuition, and understanding of God or the gods. It's about *personal* spiritual experience.

* **Option B** refers to achieving enlightenment through shared, communal feelings. This is about external validation and group experience, not the introspective, personal connection that defines Saphiri sa moya. It emphasizes conformity and external acceptance rather than individual spiritual understanding.

Let's look at why the other options *are* aligned with Saphiri sa moya:

* **A: Ho batla boikutlo ba nneteng ya bomodimo (Seeking a deep feeling of the divine)** - This is directly mentioned as a characteristic of Saphiri sa moya.
* **C: Ho toboketsa boemo bo monate ba kelello (Accessing a state of elevated consciousness)** -  This is listed as a method used to support the experience of Saphiri sa moya, leading to feelings of bliss and understanding.
* **D: Ho phehella kutlwisiso e hlokolosi ya Modimo (Achieving profound understanding of God)** - This is explicitly stated as a characteristic of the Saphiri sa moya experience.



Therefore, option B is the only one that doesn't reflect the core principles of Saphiri sa moya, which centers on a personal, internal connection with the divine.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya qadileng setjhaba sa temo?","The correct answer is **C: Batho ba Maori ba tswang Polynesia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""hone ho dumelwa hore baahi ba New Zealand e ne e le batho ba Maori, bao ba neng ba tsoma dinonyana tse kgolo tse bitswang di-moa.""  This directly indicates that the Maori were the original inhabitants of New Zealand and therefore established the first settlement.

While the passage goes on to describe the later migration of the Moriori, it identifies the Maori as the initial founders.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, sehlopha se neng se tsoma moas e bile baahi ba pele ba sebaka sefe?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

The text states: ""hone ho dumelwa hore baahi ba New Zealand e ne e le batho ba Maori, bao ba neng ba tsoma dinonyana tse kgolo tse bitswang di-moa."" (it is believed that the inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people, who used to fish for large fish called moa.)

Ke boemo bofe bo neng bo ka sebedisa mokgwa wa Pureland wa origami molemong wa foldara?,"The correct answer is **A: Foldara e kgetha ho etsa memeno e mengata ka nako e le nngwe.**

Here's why:

The description of Pureland origami states that ""mameno a mang a rarahaneng jwaloka ho mena o kgutlela morao ha aa dumellwa, mme mameno wohle a leba pele feela."" This means the folds are all forward folds, and no reverse folds are allowed. This method is designed for efficiency and creating multiple teeth at once.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Foldara e na le tsebo e tswetseng pele ya ho sebetsa:** While the method might require some understanding, it's not necessarily a prerequisite for its use.
* **C: Foldara e theha mokgwa wa origami o hlokang memeno ya ho kgutlela morao:** This is the opposite of Pureland origami's design.
* **D: Foldara e se e lekile hanngwe kapa habedi feela pele:**  The description doesn't mention the number of trials, but the core principle is about forward folds, not the number of attempts.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo mokgwa ya Pureland wa origami?,"The correct answer is **A: E etseditswe difoldara tse nang le boiphihlelo (It is made with flexible folders)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Origami ya Pureland ke origami e nang le thibelo ya hore ke lemeno le le leng feela le ka etswang ka nako..."" (Pureland origami is an origami that is restricted to using only one piece of paper at a time...)  This directly contradicts the idea of using flexible folders.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Mokgwa ona ha o kenyelletse mameno a ho kgotlela morao (The method does not involve folding back)** - The text says ""mameno a mang a rarahaneng jwaloka ho mena o kgutlela morao ha aa dumellwa"" (other folds like folding back are not allowed).
* **C: Mameno a tlameha ho ba le dibaka tse otlolohileng (The folds must have defined spaces)** - The text states ""mameno wohle a leba pele feela"" (all folds only face forward). This implies defined spaces are necessary.
* **D: Ke mokgwa o motle bakeng sa difoldara tse nang le tsebo e fokolang (It is a good method for folders with little expertise)** - The text mentions it was developed to help people with dental issues or those confined, suggesting ease of use was a consideration.



Therefore, option A is the only one that *doesn't* accurately reflect the description of Pureland origami in the text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebaka sefe se sa amaneng le Ntshetsopele Kgohlong ya Indus?","The correct answer is **C: Dibaka tsohle tse ka leboya botjhabela ho Afghanistan**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Indus Valley Civilization spanned parts of present-day Pakistan, northwest India, *and* northwest Afghanistan.  While Afghanistan *was* part of the civilization's reach, the question asks for a location *not* associated with it. 
* Harappa, the Indus River, and parts of Pakistan are all explicitly mentioned as being part of the civilization.
* Noka ya Sarasvati is mentioned as a possible companion river to the Indus, and the civilization is sometimes referred to as Indus-Sarasvati.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bolelwang e le lebitso le ka bang teng bakeng sa ntshetsopele ya Mehla ya Bronze e boletsweng serapeng?,"The correct answer is **D: Ntshetsopele ya Phula ya Indus**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that while some scholars call it the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, the civilization is *also* known as the Harappan Civilization, named after the first excavated site, Harappa.
* The text mentions that there were also settlements along the Sarasvati River.
* There is no mention of a ""Phula"" (which translates to ""flower"" in some languages) civilization in the text.

Therefore, ""Ntshetsopele ya Phula ya Indus"" is not mentioned and is unlikely to be a correct name for the civilization based on the provided text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e hlahisang molemo wa nako e telele?","The correct answer is **A: Ho sebedisana le ba bang (Working with others)**.

Here's why:

The question asks about long-term benefits based on the provided text. The text states: ""Meharo le boithati ho tla dula ho le teng mme ke boemo ba ho sebedisana ba hore moo ba bangata ba ruwang molemo teng ho tla dula ho na le ho hongata ho ka ruiwang ka nako e kgutshwanyane ka ho tshwara ka boithati. Re tshepa hore, bongata ba batho bo tla bona hore ho kgetho e ntle haholo ke ho sebedisana le ba bang.""

This translates to: ""Challenges and effort will always be present, and the situation of working together is one where many people benefit, and there is a lot that can be achieved in a short time by working together. We believe that the majority of people will see that it is a very good choice to work with others.""

The text emphasizes the benefits of working *together* (ho sebedisana le ba bang) and achieving more in a shorter time.  Therefore, working with others is presented as the option that leads to the greatest long-term benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho etelletsa dithahasello tsa hao pele (Pursuing your own interests)** - While this can be beneficial, the text focuses on the benefits of collective effort.
*   **C: Ho hatisa se neng se tla tswela batho ba fokolang molemo ho feta ba bangata (Blocking something that would benefit fewer people more than others)** - This is negative and doesn't align with the overall positive tone of the text.
*   **D: Ho hlokomela hore meharo e ka ba molemo (Acknowledging that challenges can be beneficial)** -  While acknowledging challenges is important, it doesn't equate to the *greatest long-term benefit*. The text specifically highlights the benefits of collaboration.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo motho a ka e etelletsang pele haeba a tsepamisitse maikutlo melemong ya hanghang?","The correct answer is **C: kutlwisisano (understanding)**.

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes the importance of cooperation and understanding others (""ho sebedisana le ba bang,"" ""ho kgetho e ntle haholo ke ho sebedisana le ba bang"").
*  If someone is paying attention to their feelings (""melemong ya hanghang""), it suggests they are becoming more aware of their own emotions and potentially the emotions of others.  This heightened self-awareness often leads to greater empathy and understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ho hloka boithati (Lack of patience)** - The passage doesn't suggest a lack of patience is the primary issue. It focuses on cooperation.
* **B: Tshebedisano (Cooperation)** - While cooperation is mentioned, the question asks what a person *experiences* when focusing on their feelings, not what action they take.
* **D: Kutlwisisano (Understanding)** - This is repeated and is the best fit as a natural outcome of emotional awareness. Understanding is a key element of successful cooperation and relationship building.



Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that focusing on feelings would lead to increased understanding.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya ileng a kwahela karolo e kholo ya ditshenyehelo tsa ntwa?","The correct answer is **C: Puso ya bokolone ya US**.

The passage states: ""Ba ile ba qobellwa ho lefa lekgetho ke puso ya bohatelli ya bokolone ba Maamerika ho behella karolo e kgolo ya ditshenyehelo le tswala ya dibonto tse fanweng ka lebitso la mmuso wa Philippine ho sebediswa matlo a ho banka a Wall Street."" This clearly indicates that the US government was responsible for a large portion of the currency's expenses.
"
Ke nako efe e tlileng pele ho mehla ya Templars?,"The correct answer is **C: Mehla e Bohareng ya Pele (Early Middle Ages)**.

The passage states: ""Pele ho nako ya Kgubung ya Mehla e Bohareng ebile Mathwasong a Mehla e Bohareng mme ha latela Bofelong ba Mehla e Bohareng, e leng seo ho dumelwang hore e fedile hoo ekabang ka selemo sa 1500.""  This directly indicates that the Early Middle Ages (around the 11th-13th centuries) came before the period of the Templars and the Crusades.
"
Ke nako efe e tlileng ka mora dilemo tsa Templars?,"The correct answer is **A: Qetellong ya Mehla e Bohareng**

Here's why:

* The question states that the Templars existed during the Crusades, which occurred from roughly 1000-1300 AD.
* The text then says the Crusades ended around the 1500s.
* Therefore, the time period *after* the Templars is the end of the Crusades.



"
Ke phekolo efe kapa mokgwa ofe oo ho sa bolelwang hore o ne o sebediswa ke dingaka kapa dingaka tse buwang nakong ya Mmuso wa Roma?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho phekola lefu la kgatello ya kelello ka mora ho sithabela maikutlo ka meriana e sa tshwaneng e robatsang.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Roman doctors developed methods to *control the effects of potent drugs* to prevent them from being harmful.  This implies they also had to deal with the psychological effects.
* The passage mentions the use of opium and scopolamine.  While scopolamine comes from a plant (herbane), the *treatment* of psychological effects after taking potent drugs is not specifically mentioned as a known Roman practice, although it's a logical extension of their efforts to manage the effects of these drugs.
* Options C and D are directly mentioned in the passage as Roman practices.



Therefore, option A is the best answer because it represents a potential, but not explicitly detailed, aspect of Roman medical practice related to potent drugs."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e sa amaneng le tswelopele e entsweng lefapheng la bongaka nakong ya Mmuso wa Roma?","The correct answer is **C: Theho ya dipetlele tsa ho ithuta (Establishment of teaching hospitals)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the development of medicine in ancient Rome, specifically:**
    *  The role of the Roman government in promoting medical advancement.
    *  The establishment of medical regulations and the creation of the first Roman medical institutions (Masupatsela a Bongaka).
    *  The involvement of emperors like Augustus in supporting physicians.
    *  The use of medicinal plants and techniques for pain management and surgery.

* **Teaching hospitals as a formalized system of medical education didn't emerge until much later in history (Middle Ages and Renaissance).** The passage doesn't mention this development.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

* **A: Ho theha Masupatsela a Bongaka (Establishment of medical institutions):** This is explicitly stated as one of the key developments.
* **B: Leano le mabifi la sesole sa Mmuso (Government support of medicine):**  The passage emphasizes the Roman government's role in advancing medicine.
* **D: Ho thaothwa ha dingaka ke Moephera (Physicians being patronized by emperors):** This is mentioned as a way the government supported the development of medicine.



"
Bokgoni ba ho bona bo itshetlehile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditho tsa kutlo tsa tsamaiso ya pono kapa mahlo.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Pono, kapa bokgoni ba ho bona bo itshetlehile ka ditho tsa kutlo tsa tsamaiso ya pono kapa mahlo."" (Vision, or the ability to see, is specialized by the sensory organs of vision or the eyes.)  Therefore, the ability to see is specialized by the sensory organs of sight.
"
Phapang ya sebopeho sa mahlo pakeng tsa dintho tse phelang e itshetlehile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ditlhoko tsa ntho e phelang**.

Here's why:

The passage states that different eye structures exist depending on the needs of the organism. This directly relates to the *needs* of the organism – what it needs to see in order to survive and thrive. The different structures evolve to fulfill those specific visual requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Karabelo ya fapaneng bo tlohang ntlheng e nngwe ho ya ho e nngwe:** While true, this is a general description of the differences, not the *reason* for those differences.
*   **C: Boemo ba ho bona ka ho hlaka:**  While eye structure affects how clearly an organism can see, the passage focuses on *why* the structures are different, not just the result.
*   **D: Ho rarahana ha ntho e phelang:**  This is irrelevant to the differences in eye structure.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana seo, ke polelo efe e buang ka Sikhism e sa bontsheng bolumedi ka nepo?","The correct answer is **A: Bosikhi e bile phello ya karohano ya maqulwana ka hara neano ya Mahindu.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Masikh a nka tumelo ya wona e fapane le Bohindu, leha a dumela hore metso ya wona e Sehindung ebile ba sebedisa meetlo ya sona."" This means Sikhism *does* have distinct beliefs and isn't simply a branch of Hinduism.
* **Option A suggests** Sikhism *is* a result of a split within Hinduism, implying it's not a separate and distinct faith. The text refutes this.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Guru ke karolo ya bohlokwa e ikgethang ho Bosikhi:** The text states, ""Guru ke tshobotsi ya motheo ya madumedi wohle a India embutle, e nkile boemo ba pele jwaloka tumelo e ka sehloohong ya Masikh.""
* **C: Diguru tse robong di ile tsa latela ka mora mothehi wa bolumedi, Guru Nanak:** The text says, ""Ho ile ha latela tlhahlamano e nngwe ya di-guru tse robong.""
* **D: Ditlwaelo tse ding tsa Masikhi di thehilwe Bohindung:** The text directly acknowledges this: ""leha a dumela hore metso ya wona e Sehindung ebile ba sebedisa meetlo ya sona.""



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e nkwang e le karolo ya motheo ya tsamaiso ya tumelo ya Bosikh?","The correct answer is **A: Kgopolo ya guru (The belief in the Guru)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Guru ke tshobotsi ya motheo ya madumedi wohle a India emba ho Sesikh, e nkile boemo ba pele jwaloka tumelo e ka sehloohong ya Masikh."" This translates to ""The Guru is the core principle of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism, it holds a primary position as the faith's foremost belief.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditlwaelo tsa Mahindu (Hindu beliefs):** While Sikhism utilizes some Hindu customs and terminology, the passage emphasizes that Sikhism has a distinct identity and a unique belief system.
* **C: Ho hana ho amohela madumedi a mang a India (Refusing to accept beliefs from other Indian religions):**  The passage mentions that Sikhism adopts some customs from other Indian religions, so this is incorrect.
* **D: Ho bua puo ya Sepunjabi (Speaking Punjabi):** While the term ""Gurmat"" is Punjabi for ""path of the guru,"" the language itself is not a core belief within Sikhism.

Therefore, the belief in the Guru is the central and defining element of Sikh faith according to the provided text.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke eng eo bana ba nang le bothata ba ho se tsepamise kelello (ADD)ho ka bang thata ho tsepamisa maikutlo ho yona?","The correct answer is **A: Mosebetsi wa sekolo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bana ba tshwerweng ke lena la ADD ba thahafallwa ho tsepamisa mohopolo dinthong tse kang mosebetsi wa sekolo..."" (Children diagnosed with ADD struggle to concentrate on things like schoolwork...).
"
"Ho latela seratswana sena, ke hobaneng ha bana ba nang le bothata ba ho se tsepamise Maikutlo ba atisa ho kopanela boitshwarong bo kotsi?","The correct answer is **B: Ho ba thusa ho ikopanya le dithaka**.

Here's why:

The text states that children with ADD often get into trouble because they ""act impulsively"" because their experiences aren't processed in the usual way. They may ""do risky things, fight, and defy authority"" due to this impulsive ""attack on the mind."" This impulsivity stems from difficulties in understanding social cues and how to navigate relationships with peers.  Therefore, acting impulsively is a way of trying to cope and connect with others when traditional communication methods fail.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho fokotsa khatello ya maikutlo** While impulsivity *can* be related to stress, the text directly links it to difficulties in processing experiences and social understanding, not just stress reduction.
*   **C: Ho fumana tlhokomelo ho batswadi ba bona**  The text focuses on the impact on relationships with peers, not specifically on parental support.
*   **D: Ho susumetsa boko ba bona** The text doesn't mention anything about stimulating their brains in the way that would cause risky behavior.



"
"Ho latela boitsebiso bo serapeng, ke efe ho ee eo e seng mohlala wa ho ruta wa sekafole?","The correct answer is **B: Morupedi wa SAT**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines ""ho ruta motho boikemelo"" (teaching someone independence) as not just teaching skills, but also equipping them with the ability to learn independently.**

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Thupelo qalong ya papadi ya khompiyutha (Tutorial of a computer program):** This provides basic instruction, but the key is that it's designed to guide a student *through* a specific program.  It doesn't necessarily foster independent learning.
* **B: Morupedi wa SAT (SAT Prep):** This focuses on preparing for a standardized test. While valuable, it's *directed* practice for a specific assessment. The student isn't necessarily learning how to learn *on their own* in a broader sense.
* **C: Lenaneo la Phuputso le ikemetseng (Self-paced learning program):** This *explicitly* encourages independent learning.  The student progresses at their own speed and is expected to take ownership of their learning.
* **D: Mokwetlisi e monyane wa liki (Simple word processor):** This provides a tool, but the passage implies teaching someone independence involves more than just providing a tool - it involves instruction and guidance.

Therefore, the SAT Prep is the option that least aligns with the passage's definition of teaching someone independence. It's about test preparation, not independent learning skills.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo mohopolo wa mokgwa wa ho ruta wa boikemelo?,"The correct answer is **C: E boetse e tsejwa e le thuto e thehilweng ho morero.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that teaching independence is *not* a way of learning, but a support system.** It clarifies that it's a tool to help someone learn new things, like using a computer program. 
* **Options A, B, and D are all consistent with the passage's description of teaching independence.** The passage mentions it helps with computer use, is a support system (more than just a learning method), and is used to provide support at the beginning of a learning journey.
* **Option C directly contradicts the passage.** The passage emphasizes that teaching independence is *not* a structured lesson or curriculum. It's a flexible support system, not a planned educational unit.



Therefore, option C is the only one that is *not* accurately reflected in the passage's explanation of teaching independence."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo efe ya MySpace e ka ruisang baithuti ba nang le bothata ba ho bala?","The correct answer is **A: Hohlophiswa (Layout)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that MySpace profiles can be ""hlophiswa hore di be bonolo ho baleha"" which translates to ""laid out to be easy to read"". This directly addresses the difficulty students might have with reading.  While other features are mentioned, only the layout is directly linked to readability.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e neng e se karolo ya karabo ya Krushchev merusung ya basebetsi?","The correct answer is **A: Kgetha tonakgolo e ntjha**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Krushchev ultimately allowed the election of Wladyslaw Gomulka, who was popular and desired as a new leader. This directly corresponds to option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sebedisa ditanka ho kgutlisa taolo** - The passage mentions Krushchev *sending* tanks to quell unrest, but the primary outcome was *not* using them to maintain control. The tanks were a measure taken *before* he ultimately conceded to the workers' demands.
*   **C: Eketsa ho fokotsa meputso** - The passage states the initial grievances revolved around food shortages and family benefits, but it doesn't indicate that Krushchev increased family restrictions as part of his response.
*   **D: Hlokomela dihoko tse ding tsa moruo** - While the passage mentions Krushchev addressing agricultural issues, the main outcome described is the change in leadership, not a broad focus on all agricultural problems.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is **A**."
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e neng e se sesosa sa merusu Poland?,"The correct answer is **A: Bokomonisi (Communism)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the strikes in Poland in June 1956 initially started due to concerns about food shortages and the reduction of families. However, the strikes *evolved into resistance against Communism*. Krushchev's response and eventual acceptance of Gomulka as leader further indicate the central issue was the Communist regime itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kgaello ya dijo (Food shortages):** While food shortages were the initial trigger, the passage explicitly states the protests *evolved* beyond just that.
*   **C: Ho fokotsa meputso (Family reduction):** Similar to food shortages, this was an initial concern but not the ultimate issue the protests centered on.
*   **D: Ho kgethwa ha Wladyslaw Gomulka (The election of Wladyslaw Gomulka):** Gomulka's election was a *result* of the protests and a concession by Krushchev, not the core grievance.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya ama dikamano pakeng tsa USSR le USA?","The correct answer is **B: Maikutlo ka Jeremane** (Feelings about Germany).

Here's why:

The passage clearly states the Cold War stemmed from disagreements about **system, methods, and culture** between the USSR and the USA. It specifically mentions the alliance between the USSR and USA ending and the subsequent hostility.  The Cold War's impact was widespread, affecting conflicts globally.

While Germany's history *influenced* the post-WWII world and the power dynamics between the US and USSR, the passage doesn't explicitly state that feelings *about Germany* were a direct cause of the Cold War *itself*. It's a related historical factor, but not a primary driver of the conflict according to the text. The other options (disagreements on systems, different methods, and conflicts about governance) are explicitly mentioned as reasons for the Cold War's beginning.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo morero wa ho romela methapo ya kutlo ho pholletsa le mmele?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho fokotsa phallo ya madi (To decrease blood flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the nervous system *maintains* proper blood flow. Decreasing blood flow would be the *opposite* of what the nervous system is trying to achieve in response to a threat or danger. The nervous system's goal is to *ensure* good blood flow to support survival.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **B: Ho laola phallo ya madi (To regulate blood flow):** This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of the nervous system's function. The nervous system *regulates* blood flow to ensure it's adequate for the body's needs.
*   **C: Ho boloka botsitso ba homeostasis (To maintain the body's safety/homeostasis):** This is the overarching goal described in the passage. The nervous system helps maintain homeostasis, which includes maintaining proper blood flow.
*   **D: Ho qoba ditshokelo tse ka bang teng mmeleng (To prevent potential dangers in the body):**  The nervous system responds to dangers and initiates actions to protect the body, including regulating blood flow to allow for a quick response.

Therefore, decreasing blood flow is the *incorrect* statement regarding the nervous system's role in maintaining homeostasis.



"
O ka fumana eng ho The Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Dimakatso tse supileng kaofela**.

The passage explicitly states that the Giza Plateau (or Giza Necropolis) has ""diphiramiti tse ngata (mme phiramiti e kgolo ke yona e di fetang kaofela), mabitla a mmalwa a manyane, ditempele tse mmalwa le Sefika se seholo kapa Sphinx e kgolo.""  Option C encompasses all these elements, making it the most accurate answer.
"
Morero oa Phiramiti e Kholo e ne e le ofe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho hlompha Faro**.

The text explicitly states: ""Phiramite e kgolo e ile ya hahuwa ho tlotla Faro Khufu..."" which translates to ""The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...""
"
Ke mang ya ikarabellang bakeng sa tsebo ya rona ya setjheso se ileng sa senya tempele?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

The passage states: ""Re tena re tseba taba ena tjena hobane rahistori wa Mogerike e leng Strabo o ile a tlaleha lebitso la motho eo."" This translates to: ""We know this story because the Greek historian Strabo recorded the name of the man who did it.""
"
Ke polelo efe e nepahetseng mabapi le ho tsosolowa ha tempele ya Artemise?,"The correct answer is **B: E ile ya hahwa botjha ka mora puso ya Alexandere e Moholo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hamorao kamora lefu la Alexander, tempele e ile ya tsosoloswa ka selemo sa 323 BCE."" (After Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.)

Option B accurately reflects this information. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kaho e ntjha e ile ya lefellwa ke Alexandere e Moholo** - The text doesn't say Alexander rebuilt it. He only offered to pay for people to rebuild it, but Ephesians rejected him.
*   **C: Herostratus o ile a laelwa hore a lefelle ditshenyehelo tsa ho tsosolosa mohaho oo** - There's no mention of Herostratus being ordered to pay for the reconstruction.
*   **D: E ile ya hahwa botjha ka 320 BCE** - The text specifies 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana seo, ke neng ha pele-pele ho ka etsahala hore mofuta o itseng o tsamaee ka maoto a mabedi?","The correct answer is **A: Dilemo tse dimilione tse supileng tse fetileng** (Millions of years ago).

The text states: ""ho hoja bo Sahelanthropus ba ka be ba ile ba tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi hoo e ka bang mathwasong a dilemong tse dimillione tse supileng tse fetileng."" (although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as 7 million years ago).
"
Ke efe ho mefuta ee e neng e tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi kgafetsa?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""le hoja bo **Sahelanthropus** ba ka be ba ile ba tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi hoo e ka bang mathwasong a dilemong tse dimillione tse supileng tse fetileng."" (and although *Sahelanthropus* may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Homo Erectus:** The text mentions *Homo Erectus* as a species that *evolved* *after* the development of bipedalism, not as one of the earliest to walk upright.
*   **C: Ho tsamaya ka maoto ka ho kgethehila (Bipedalism):** While bipedalism is the *ability* to walk on two legs, it's not a specific species.
*   **D: Australopithecus:** The text says that *Australopithecus* did *not* typically walk bipedally. While some evidence suggests they *could* walk upright at times, it wasn't their primary mode of locomotion.



"
Sesole sa metsing sa Jeremane se ne se leka ho finyella eng nakong ya WWII?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho thibela thepa e tswang Brithani**.

The passage states that German U-boats were trying to ""thiba sephethephethe,"" which translates to ""block the supply route"" or ""prevent supplies from reaching."" This directly corresponds to preventing goods from Britain from reaching its ports.
"
"Ho latela boitsebiso bo fanweng serapengng sena, ke mang ya ileng a atleha ka ho fetisisa ntweng ya metsing nakong ya Letsholo la Lewatle la Atlantic Leboya?","The correct answer is **D: Mabrithani**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the US and Britain were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic, while Germany was trying to *stop* them. The passage concludes that if Germany had succeeded in stopping the Atlantic convoys, they *could have* conquered all of Europe.  This implies that Britain and America *succeeded* in keeping the convoys going and therefore were the ones who ultimately prevailed in the naval battle of the Atlantic.
"
Ke eng e neng e le siyo ha ba-Assyria ba kenya tshebetsong tshebediso ya bapalami ba dipere?,"The correct answer is **A: Disale (Remnants)**.

The text states: ""Ho ne ho eso qaptjwe disale, kahoo sesole sa Assyria se ne se lwana se sa beha letho mekokotlong ya dipere."" This translates to: ""Only remnants were found, so the Assyrian army fought without anything in their boat compartments."" Therefore, they started using captured remnants to create their boat army.
"
Dintwa tse sebedisang bapalami ba dipere di lwanwa jwang?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka pere**.

The text states: ""Sesole sa dipere ke mabotho a lwanang a kaletse dipere."" which translates to ""The chariot corps is a corps of fierce fighting chariots."" This implies the soldiers fought *from* the chariots, using them as their primary weapon.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke hokae moo o ke keng wa fumana moahi ya tlwaelehileng wa Babylona?","The correct answer is **C: A le moketeng o lebaleng la tempele**.

Here's why:

The passage states that only priests were allowed to enter the inner sanctuary of the temple.  People brought offerings to the temple, but they did so in the courtyard (lebaleng la tempele). Therefore, you wouldn't find a typical Babylonian worshipper *inside* the inner sanctuary.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e neng e etseditswe baprista ka ho kgetheha?,"The correct answer is **B: Dibaka tse halalelang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...baprista ba ne ba ikitlaelletsa ho tlisetsa medimo dintho tseo e di hlokang ka meetlo le mekete.""  This means priests would use the sacred spaces (dibaka tse halalelang) to present offerings (including meat) to the gods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mekete (Meat):** While meat *was* offered, the question asks where the priests performed the ritual. The passage indicates it was in the sacred spaces.
*   **C: Mekete (Meat):** Same reason as A.
*   **D: Di-Ziggurat (Ziggurats):** Ziggurats were part of the temple complex, but the priests didn't specifically perform rituals *inside* the ziggurats. They did so within the sacred spaces connected to the ziggurat.



"
Morena Tutankhamun o ile a tsebahala neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka mora ho sibollwa ha lebitla la hae**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Le hoja ho ile ha utsuwa mabitleng a mangata a kgale, lebitla lena le bonahala le ile la tlohelwa mme ha ho a kenakenanwa le lona. Boholo ba dintho tseo Tutankhamun a ileng a patwa le tsona di bolokilwe hantle, ho kopanyelletsa le dithulusi le mekgabiso e dikete e entsweng ka ditshepe tsa bohlokwa le majwe a sa tlwaelehang."" This implies that his fame and recognition significantly increased *after* the discovery of his tomb.

While his reign was important, it wasn't the moment he became famous. And the passage indicates he wasn't initially considered particularly significant during his lifetime.
"
Ke eng e ileng ya etsa hore Morena Tutankhamun e be morena ya tsebahalang wa Egepeta?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho sibollwa ha lebitla la hae le sa kgathatswang (The unearthing of his tomb)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho sibollwa ha lebitla la hae ka 1922 ho ile ha mo etsa motho ya tummeng."" (The unearthing of his tomb in 1922 made him a famous person.)

While options B, C, and D contain elements related to Tutankhamun, they are not the *primary* reason for his fame according to the passage. His fame is directly linked to the discovery of his tomb.
"
Seroki sa Mogerike Homer se ile sa sitwa ho etsang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho utlwa (He heard)**.

The text states: ""Mohlomong motho ya tummeng haholo wa moetlo ona ke Homer, seroki se tummeng se foufetseng, se ileng sa qapa dingolwa tse pedi tse ratwang haholo tsa Segerike: e leng dithothokiso tsa Iliad le Odyssey."" This implies Homer *heard* the stories and poems he composed, rather than seeing, traveling, or speaking them into existence.  The passage refers to him as a ""poet"" who *composed* these works.

Therefore, ""ho utlwa"" (to hear) is the most fitting answer.
"
Ke Segerike sefe se tsebahalang ka ho hong ntle le dingolwang?,"The correct answer is **B: Di-Homer**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mohlomong motho ya tummeng haholo wa moetlo ona ke Homer, seroki se tummeng se foufetseng, se ileng sa qapa dingolwa tse pedi tse ratwang haholo tsa Segerike: e leng dithothokiso tsa Iliad le Odyssey.""  This directly links Homer to famous works of Greek literature.

While Sophocles, Pythagoras, and Aristophanes are also mentioned as important figures, the passage highlights Homer's *writings* as the most well-known aspect of his contribution.  The question asks what was known about Greece *besides* writing, but the answer is looking for the most famous figure associated with Greek literature.
"
Lelapa la Baheberu le ne le qeta boholo ba nako ya lona hokae?,"The correct answer is **A: Sebakeng se bulehileng (The open air)**.

The passage states: ""Sebakeng sa Botjhabela bo Hare moo ho futhumetseng, ntlo e ne e se bohlokwa hakaalo. Malapa a Baheberu a ne a phela nako e ngata a le kantle moo a hahlwang ke moya."" (In the hot region of the Negev, the house was not so important. The Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors, sheltered by the wind.)
"
Ke eng eo e neng e se ya bohlokwa hakaalo lelapeng la Baheberu?,"The correct answer is **C: Lehae la bona (Their house)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sebakeng sa Botjhabela bo Hare moo ho futhumetseng, ntlo e ne e se bohlokwa hakaalo."" (In the region of the Negev, which is hot, the house was not as important.)

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloswang e le phapang dipakeng tsa dinaha tsa Scandinavia?,"The correct answer is **A: History**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while Greenland became associated with Scandinavian culture due to Erik the Red, it was inhabited by Inuit people already. It highlights that despite the Scandinavian influence, there were significant differences in people, customs, and *history* between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.  The passage emphasizes that Greenland's history, while influenced by Scandinavians, didn't perfectly mirror the histories of the other Scandinavian countries.

The passage *does* mention differences in:

*   **People:** The Inuit population of Greenland.
*   **Customs:** Implied by the statement about differences in culture.
*   **Meqgwa (traditions/ways of life):** Again, implied by cultural differences.
*   **Nalane (history):**  The passage directly contrasts the history of Greenland with that of the other Scandinavian countries.



Therefore, **History** is the element that the passage specifically says is *not* the same across all the Scandinavian countries, and is therefore the correct answer to the question."
Ke mang ya ileng a dula Greenland pele?,"The correct answer is **A: Merabe ya maeskimo**.

The text states: ""Leha a ile a sibolla naha ena, merabe ya Maeskimo e ne e se e ntse e dula moo ka nako eo.""  This translates to ""Even though he settled the country, Eskimo people were already living there at that time.""
"
Ke sehlopha sefe se ratang ho ja se sa dula ditulong?,"The correct answer is **C: Banna ba ruileng ba Roma**.

The passage states: ""ha mafutsana le basadi ba ne ba ja dijo tsa bona ba dutse ditulong, banna ba barui ba ne ba rata ho ba mmoho meketeng moo ba neng ba ka otla ka lehlakore ha ba ntse ba ja dijo tsa bona."" (While slaves and women ate their meals in the dormitories, free men liked to be in the market where they could eat while trading.)
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e neng e ke ke ya e-ba karolo ya mokete wa Roma ya Kgale?,"The correct answer is **D: Sejana sa turkey e hadikilweng (Roasted turkey)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Romans of antiquity did not have access to foods that originated in the Americas or Asia until much later. Roasted turkey is a New World food, meaning it wouldn't have been part of their diet in ancient times.

Let's look at why the other options *could* have been part of a Roman feast:

* **A: Baeti ba futsanehileng ba ja ditulong (Guests ate honey cakes):** The passage mentions they ate ""dijo tsa mohlolo"" (delicacies) and honey cakes would fit that description.
* **B: Sejo se monate sa dikhofu (A fancy dish of goose):** The passage specifically mentions goose as something they ate.
* **C: Banna ba ruileng ba robala nakong ya dijo tsa mantsiboya (Married men slept during midday meals):** The passage notes a cultural difference where men would eat in the market and sleep while eating.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya e-ba le tshusumetso e tshwarellang?","The correct answer is **B: Tlwaelo e nyane (Small Settlement)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines civilization as a large-scale social group (setjhaba) with cooperation and interaction.**  Small settlements are not large enough to be considered a civilization.
* **The passage states that civilizations (kahisano) are built upon cities (motsemoholo).**
* **The passage explicitly mentions that civilizations have a system for transmitting knowledge.**
* **The passage defines civilization (kahisano) as a large, self-aware society.**

Therefore, a small settlement doesn't meet the criteria of a civilization as described in the passage. The other options (setjhaba, motsemoholo, and kahisano) *are* components or characteristics of a civilization.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e etellang setjhaba pele?","The correct answer is **A: Kahisano (civilization)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kahisano (civilization) ke mokgwa o le mong wa sehlopha se seholo haholo sa batho ba dulang mmoho le ho sebedisana, e leng setjhaba.""  This translates to: ""Civilization is one way of a very large group of people living together and interacting, which is a nation."" The text then goes on to define civilization and its importance. Therefore, according to the passage, civilization comes first.
"
Ke polelo efe ka The Drukgyal Dzong eo e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: E hahilwe ho keteka tlholo ya mabotho a Tibetan-Mongol**.

Here's why:

* The text clearly states Drukgyal Dzong was built in **1649 to counter attacks from Tibetan-Mongol armies**.  It wasn't built to celebrate their victories.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: E fumaneha Bhutan** - The text states it's in the upper Paro District of Bhutan.
* **C: Mollo o ile wa tjhesa mesaletsa e mengata ya qhobosheane** - The text mentions significant damage from the fire, leaving only some important artifacts.
* **D: E entswe ke Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - The text explicitly states that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the Dzong.



"
Ke polelo efe e hlalosang ka nepo sephetho sa mollo ho Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntho feela e setseng e ne e le setshwantsho sa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka 1951, ho ile ha qhoma mollo mme ha sala feela diemahale tse ding tse rapelwang tsa Drukgyal Dzong, tse kang setshwantsho sa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""  This translates to: ""In 1951, a fire broke out and only a few remaining important structures of Drukgyal Dzong remained, such as the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""

This directly indicates that after the fire, *only* the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was left standing. The other structures were destroyed.  Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they describe events *before* the fire or misrepresent the outcome.



"
Dipolelong tse latelang ka Cambodia ke dife tseo e leng nnete?,"The correct answer is **C: Cambodia e ile ya hlaselwa ke Mavietnam mathwasong a lekholo la bo-18 la dilemo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Qetellong ya ngwahakgolo wa bo18, Vietnam le yona e ile ya hapa Cambodia."" (In the end of the 18th-century conflict, Vietnam also attacked Cambodia.)
*   The passage also mentions Thailand attacked Cambodia multiple times, including recapturing Phnom Penh in 1772.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ma-Vietnam a ile a senya Phnom Phen** (Vietnamese people attacked Phnom Penh) - The passage says Vietnam attacked Cambodia, not that Vietnamese people specifically attacked Phnom Penh.
*   **B: Cambodia e ile ya hlasela Thailand ka-1772** (Cambodia attacked Thailand in 1772) - The passage states Thailand attacked Cambodia in 1772.
*   **D: Mathai a ile a senya -Phnom Phen** (Thai people attacked Phnom Penh) - While the passage mentions Thailand attacking and recapturing Phnom Penh, it doesn't explicitly state that the Thai people *attacked* Phnom Penh. It's more about the *kingdom* of Thailand.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo tlhaselo ya Cambodia?,"The best answer is **B: Mathai le Ma-Vietnam ba ile ba hlasela Cambodia ka-1772**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Thailand e ile ya hapa Cambodia ka makgetlo a mmalwa ka ngwahakgolo wa bo18 mme ka 1772 ya ripitla Phnom Phen. Qetellong ya ngwahakgolo wa bo18, Vietnam le yona e ile ya hapa Cambodia."" (Thailand attacked Cambodia several times during the 18th century and in 1772 recaptured Phnom Phen. At the end of the 18th century, Vietnam also attacked Cambodia.)
* **Option B accurately reflects this:** It mentions both Thailand and Vietnam attacking Cambodia and specifically notes the year 1772.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ma-Vietnam a ile a hlasela Cambodia ka makha a mmalwa** - The passage says Thailand attacked Cambodia several times, not Vietnam.
    * **C: Ma-Vietnam a ile a senya Phnom Phen** - The passage says Thailand *recaptured* Phnom Phen in 1772, not Vietnam. While Vietnam attacked, the passage doesn't explicitly say they *captured* Phnom Phen.
    * **D: Mathai a ile a hlasela Cambodia ka makgetlo a mmalwa** - The passage says Thailand attacked Cambodia several times, not Vietnam.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo Khampani ya Dutch East India e sa kang ya e etsa nakong eo e neng e le Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **D: E ikemiseditse ho fana ka taolo ya Taiwan ho lesika la Qing** (It did not dedicate itself to handing over Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that in 1683, the Qing Dynasty took control of Taiwan.
* The Dutch East India Company established a presence, developed the pineapple industry, and used Chinese laborers.
* However, the text *doesn't* say they ever handed Taiwan over to the Qing. They were eventually ousted by the Qing.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct:

* **A: E-ba le setsi karolong e ka borwa-bophirimela ya sehlekehleke** (It established a presence in the northern part of the island): The text says they did this.
* **B: Itlwaetse tlhahiso ya dijo-thollo tsa matswalloa** (It promoted the production of pineapple crops): The text says they developed the pineapple industry.
* **C: Hira basebetsi ba Machaena masimong a yona** (It hired Chinese laborers in its plantations): The text says they hired Chinese laborers.



"
Selekane sa Shimonoseki se thehile eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Bolaodi ba Japane hodima Taiwan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka 1895, kamora ho hlolwa Ntweng ya Pele ya Sino-Majapane (1894-1895), mmuso wa Qing o saena Tumellano ya Shimonoseki, eo ho yona e nehelang puso ya Taiwan ho Japane, e busang sehlekehleke sena ho fihla selemong sa 1945.""  This directly says that the Treaty of Shimonoseki transferred control of Taiwan to Japan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho hlolwa ha Japane Ntweng ya Pele ya Sino-Japanese:** While the treaty *followed* the war, the war itself didn't *create* the treaty. It was the outcome of the war that led to the treaty.
* **B: Boemo ba Taiwan e le profinse tlasa leloko la borena la Qing:** The text says Taiwan was a Qing colony *before* the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The treaty changed its ruler.
* **C: Bokgoni ba Taiwan ba ho kgutlisa taolo dibakeng tsa yona tse lebopong la lewatle:** The text doesn't mention Taiwan's ability to control coastal areas. It focuses on its political control.
"
Boemo ba pH ba khemikhale bo lekanngwa jwang?,"The correct answer is **C: Palo ya di-ion tsa Haedrojene khemikhale**.

Here's why:

* **pH is defined as a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution.** The more hydrogen ions present, the lower the pH (more acidic), and the fewer hydrogen ions, the higher the pH (more alkaline/basic).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khemikhale ke ya motheo kapa e nang le asiti hakae:**  While acids *contribute* to pH, pH is a *measurement* of the concentration of hydrogen ions, not just whether a substance has acid.
* **B: Ke diprothone tse kae ka khemikhaleng:** This is close, but ""di-ion tsa Haedrojene"" (hydrogen ions) is the more precise scientific term than just ""diprothone.""
* **D: Ke di-electron tse kae ka hara dikhemikhale:** Electrons are related to chemical bonding, but they are not directly responsible for determining pH. pH is about the concentration of hydrogen ions.



"
Ke eng e tlositsweng ho di-ion tsa Haedrojene?,"The correct answer is **A: Di-proton**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diayone tsa Haedrojine ke di-proton tseo di-electron tsa tsona di tlositsweng ho tsona...""  This directly indicates that a hydrogen ion (proton) has lost an electron.
"
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo boikakaso ba ditau?,"The correct answer is **B: Karo-karolelano ya tse tona le tshehadi ha e tshwane (The ratio of mammals to reptiles is not the same)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Mehlapi e entswe ka tau e tona e le nngwe ho fihla ho tse tharo tse kgolo tse amanang, mmoho le tse tshehadi tse ngata bo ka fihlang ho tse mashome a mararo le madinyane."" (A herd is composed of one mammal to up to three related reptiles, ranging from one to three large, with many small mammals, reaching up to thirty and some.)  This implies a variable ratio, not a consistent one.
* **Option A is correct:** The text explicitly states ""Mehlapi ya ditau e itshwara jwalo ka mehlape ya dintja..."".
* **Option C is incorrect:** The text states ""Ditau tse tshehadi ka tlwaelo di amana haholo, e leng lelapa le leholo la bonnake le baradi."" (Reptiles typically bond closely, which is a large family of snakes and lizards.)
* **Option D is correct:** The text states ""Di ka bolaya le ho ba lephidisano bakeng sa dinyamatsane tsa tsona."" (They can kill and have competition for their own species.)



Therefore, the inconsistency in the mammal-to-reptile ratio is the poorly explained aspect of mammal behavior.



"
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo boitshwaro ba ditau?,"The correct answer is **B: Boitshoaro ba tsona bo tshwana le ba diphiri.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mehlapi ya ditau e itshwara jwalo ka mehlape ya makanyane kapa dintja, diphoofolo tse makatsang ka ho tshwana le ditau (empa e seng dikatse te ding tse kgolo) **ka boitshwaro, mme hape di le kotsi bakeng sa dinyamatsane tsa tsona.**"" This directly contradicts option B, which says their behavior is similar to felines (cats).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di lephedisano ka ho fetisisa:**  The passage states they have a ""phedisano ka ho fetisisa"" (close relationship), which is accurate.
* **C: Ka bobedi tse tona le tse tshehadi di kotsi haholo ho diphofu:** The passage says they are a threat to other animals.  While they *could* be dangerous to prey, the passage doesn't claim they are *extremely* dangerous to all prey animals.
* **D: Boitshwaro ba tsona bo tshwana le ba dikatse tse ding tse kholo:** The passage explicitly says their behavior is *not* like larger cats.



Therefore, option B is the only one that is *not* explained accurately by the passage."
Mebutlanyana ke phofu e tlwaelehileng ya sebatana sa mofuta ofe?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikatse tse nyane**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Qetellong, ho na le dikatse tse ngata tse nyane (ho kenyeletswa dikatse tsa malapeng tse sollang) tse jang diphoofotswana tse ngata haholo tse nyane jwalo ka dikokonyana, ditweba, mekgudutswane, le dinonyana."" (Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat many small prey such as mice, voles, shrews, and moles.)
"
Dikatse tse nyane di atisa ho tsoma efe ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditweba**.

The passage states: ""...ho na le dikatse tse nyane (ho kenyeletswa dikatse tsa malapeng tse sollang) tse jang diphoofotswana tse ngata haholo tse nyane jwalo ka dikokonyana, **ditweba**, mekgudutswane, le dinonyana.""

Therefore, small cats eat shrews.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng karolo ya mokgwa wa ho tsoma wa ocelot?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho ja diphoofolo tse nyane feela.**

Here's why:

* The text states that ocelots hunt a variety of small animals like squirrels, birds, rodents, and reptiles. They don't *only* eat small animals.
* The other options are all mentioned in the text as part of their hunting strategy:
    * **A: Ho ipata tikolohong ya tsona** (Adapting to their environment) - They use camouflage.
    * **B: Ho latela monko wa phofu ya tsona** (Following the scent of prey) - They hunt by scent.
    * **C: Ho latela phofu ya tsona bosiu** (Hunting at night) - They have excellent night vision.



Therefore, option D is the only one that isn't supported by the provided text."
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ocelot ka nepo? ,"The correct answer is **B: Di tsamaya ka kgutso (They walk on all fours)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Di ka bona hantle lefifing ka pono ya bosiu, le ho tsamaya ka ho ngotla mohwasa haholo, hape."" (They can see well at night with night vision, and they also walk very stealthily.)  This means they don't walk on all fours.
* **The passage confirms:** ""Di rata ho tsoma ditshwene, dinoha, ditweba le dinonyana haeba di ka kgona."" (They like to hunt rodents, rabbits, birds, and lizards if they can.)
* **The passage says:** ""Borasaense ba nahana hore di-ocelot di latela le ho fumana diphoofolo tseo di di jang (nyamatsane) ka monko..."" (Scientists think that ocelots follow to find the animals that eat (meat) by scent...) This implies their sense of smell is important, not weak.
* **The passage confirms:** ""Di ka tsoma nyamatsane ya tsona ka ho ikgakanya le sebaka seo di leng ho sona ebe di tlolela nyamatsane."" (They hunt their prey by scenting the place where it is and then going to the prey.) This implies their sense of smell is strong.



Therefore, the only statement that is *not* accurately described in the passage is that they walk on all fours.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ke keng ya nkwa e le matla a maholohadi a nkwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho qhoma**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that roaring is a primary display of power in leopards.
* The passage also mentions that clawing, stalking, and pouncing are also displays of power.
* The question asks which is *not* considered a primary display of power.  The passage doesn't mention stalking or pouncing, but it definitely emphasizes roaring and physical displays like clawing and pouncing.
* **Ho qhoma** (to purr) is the opposite of a display of power; it's a sign of contentment or relaxation.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Ho qhoma**.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, phapang ke efe pakeng tsa dinkwe le ditau?","The correct answer is **A: Bokgoni ba ho sesa (The ability to purr)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ho rora ha nkwe ha ho jwalo ka ha tau e hotseng ka botlalo, empa ho jwalo ka polelo ya mantswe a bitswang ka ho rora, a hoeletswa.""  This translates to: ""Purring is not like a cat meowing, but it is like a word called purring, a hum.""  This implies that purring is a unique characteristic of the leopard (nkwe) that distinguishes it from other cats like lions.

While leopards *can* roar and have powerful muscles, the key difference highlighted in the passage is their unique purring ability. The passage explicitly links purring to the leopard's characteristic ""word.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, Robert Hooke o ile a etsa eng pele ho ditsebi tse ding tsa baeloji?","The correct answer is **A: Sheba disele tse shweleng**.

The passage states: ""Robert Hooke, setsebi sa baeloji se tswang Engelane, o bone disekwere tse nyenyane tsa cork ka motjhine o hodisang ponahalo ya dintho. Di ne di shebala jwaloka diphaposi. E ne e le motho wa ho qala wa ho hlahloba disele tse shweleng."" (Robert Hooke, an English biologist, saw small squares of cork through a microscope. They looked like compartments. He was one of the first to examine living cells.)
"
Tshimoloho ya lentswe “sele” e bolelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebopeho se senyane**

The text states: ""Sele ke sebopeho se senyenyane se sebetsang sa (dintho) kapa dibopuwa tse phelang."" This translates to ""A cell is a small working unit of (things) or living structures.""  Therefore, ""sele"" means a small structure or component.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, diphoofolo tse ngata di na le matla a ho etsa eng?","The correct answer is **A: Fofa**.

The passage states: ""Diphoofolo di fofa sepakapakeng."" This translates to ""Jellyfish float in the water."" Therefore, ""fofa"" (float) is the action the passage describes jellyfish doing.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, diphoofolo tse ding ha di na eng?","The correct answer is **C: Boko**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Diphoofolo tse ngata di kgona ho sisinyeha. Diphoofolo feela tse nang le boko (le hoja e se diphoofolo tsohle tse jwalo, jellyfish, ka mohlala, ha e na boko).""  This means not all animals have a backbone. The question asks what *other* animals *don't* have, and the passage highlights the backbone as a defining characteristic of many animals, but not *all*.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Disele:** The passage says ""Diphhofolo di entswe ka disele tse ngata"" (Animals are made up of many cells), so animals *do* have cells.
*   **B: Bokgoni ba ho sila dijo:** The passage states ""Di ja dintho mme di di sille ka hare"" (They eat things and digest them), meaning animals *do* have the ability to digest food.
*   **D: Bokgoni ba ho ja:** The passage states ""Di ja dintho"" (They eat things), meaning animals *do* have the ability to eat.



"
Ke eng e thusang dimela tshebetsong ya tala?,"The correct answer is **D: Letsatsi**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Dimela di etsa dijo tsa tsona ho tswa letsatsing ka tshebetso ya photosynthesis."" (Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis.)
* **Photosynthesis** is the process where plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create food (sugar) and oxygen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moriti (Fertilizer):**  While fertilizer can help plants grow, it's not *essential* for photosynthesis. Plants can photosynthesize without fertilizer.
* **B: Diphoofolo (Animals):** Animals rely on plants for food, but they don't directly help plants with photosynthesis.
* **C: Dijo (Food):** Food is *produced* through photosynthesis, not what helps the process happen.



"
Ke eng seo batho ba se hemang se hengwang ke dimela?,"The correct answer is **D: Khabondaeoksaede (Carbon Dioxide)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dimela di nka khabone daeoksaete eo batho ba e hemelang kantle (ke hore, e tswang mmeleng ya bona).""  This translates to ""Plants take the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, from their body).""

Therefore, carbon dioxide is what plants consume from human exhalations. While plants *produce* oxygen, the question asks what they *take* from us.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho mehlala e latelang e ka sitisang tshebetso ya ho iphetola ha dintho?","The correct answer is **A: Sehlopha se senyenyane se hlolehang ho atleha sebakeng se setjha.**

Here's why:

The text describes speciation as a process where a single species evolves into two distinct species. It starts with a population being separated and adapting to different environments.  

* **A: Sehlopha se senyenyane se hlolehang ho atleha sebakeng se setjha (A small, isolated group successfully colonizes a new habitat)** is the initial step in speciation.  The small group is isolated from the original population, allowing them to adapt to the new environment independently. This isolation and adaptation are crucial for speciation to occur.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Karolo ya baahi ba le bang ba fallelang tikolohong e ntjha (A portion of the inhabitants expanding into a new habitat)**  While habitat expansion *can* lead to isolation, it doesn't automatically guarantee speciation.  The expanding group might still remain connected to the original population.
* **C: Palo ya batho e fetolang boemo ba yona tikolohong e ntjha (A change in the number of people adjusting to their position in a new habitat)** This is too general.  The *number* of people isn't the key factor; it's the *isolation* and subsequent adaptation.
* **D: Qetellong baahi ba le bang ba imena habedi (Finally, the inhabitants divide into two)**  This describes a *result* of speciation, but not the initiating cause.  The division happens *after* isolation and adaptation.



Therefore, a small, isolated group successfully colonizing a new habitat is the most direct example of a scenario that can initiate the process of speciation, according to the text.



"
Ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo tshebetso ya ho iphetola ha mefuta ya dintho? ,"The correct answer is **C: E bolela ho thehwa ha mofuta o motjha.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly defines speciation as ""the emergence of a new, reproductively isolated species."" Option C directly reflects this definition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E etsahala ha dintho di sa khone ho ikamahanya le maemo:** While environmental changes *can* drive speciation, the passage doesn't state that speciation *only* happens because organisms can't adapt.
* **B: Ke karolo ya bohlokwa ya tshebetso ya ho iphetola ha ntho:** The passage states that speciation is a *result* of evolutionary processes, not a component *of* them.
* **D: Ho etsahala ha yona ho ke ke ha qojwa:** The passage clearly states that speciation is a crucial part of evolutionary history.



"
Ke karolo efe ya tsamaiso ya ho potoloha ha madi e tlisang madi pelong?,"The correct answer is **A: Methapo e tlosang madi pelong (Arteries)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Madi a tloha pelong ka ditjhubu tse bitswang methapo ya madi ya di-artery..."" which translates to ""Blood leaves the heart through vessels called arteries...""  This directly answers the question of what carries blood *to* the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dikhapilari (Capillaries):** Capillaries are tiny vessels where exchange of oxygen and nutrients happens. They don't carry blood *to* the heart.
* **C: Ditho (Veins):** Veins carry blood *away* from the heart.
* **D: Di-vein (Veins):** Veins also carry blood *away* from the heart.



"
Ke methapo efe e menyenyane ka ho fetisisa tsamaisong ya madi?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikhapilari**.

The passage states: ""Dikhapilari tse nyane ka ho fetisisa di bitswa dikhapilari."" (The smallest vessels are called capillaries.)
"
Bokgoni ba kokoanyana ba ho phutha mapheo a yona bo eketsa efe ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho fofa ka lebelo (Avoiding predators)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to burrow helped anteaters escape predators and find food and mates. It specifically says, ""Sena se di fa sebaka se seholo sa dibaka tse nyane tsa hore di ipatele diphoofolo tse hlaselang."" (This gives them a large space to hide from predators.)

While the other options (finding food, finding mates, and burrowing) are all benefits of burrowing, the primary purpose highlighted in the passage is *avoiding predators*.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa bolelwang serapeng e le ntho e anngweng ke bokgoni ba kokoanyana ba ho fofa?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolelele ba bophelo (Longevity)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how the ability to burrow helps prairie dogs survive.** It mentions finding food, escaping predators, and having safe places to hide.
* **The passage doesn't explicitly link burrowing to increased lifespan.** While survival *can* contribute to a longer life, the primary focus is on the immediate benefits of burrowing for protection and resource access.
* **The other options are directly mentioned or implied:**
    * **A: Ho ikatisa (Shelter):**  Burrows provide shelter.
    * **C: Ho bokella dijo (Finding food):**  The passage states burrowing helps find food.
    * **D: Katleho (Success):** The passage implies burrowing leads to success in survival.

Therefore, longevity is the least directly supported claim based on the text.
"
Ke ditshobotsi dife ho tse latelang tseo hangata di sa amaneng le di-dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **B: Masiba**.

Here's why:

The passage states that humans don't resemble dinosaurs because we have spines and can walk upright. The question asks which characteristic is *least* associated with dinosaurs.

* **Ho tsamaya ka maoto a ka morao (Walking on two legs):**  The passage mentions that some ""dinosaurs"" (dodos) walk on two legs, so this *is* associated with them.
* **Ho behela mahe (Beak):** The passage states that dodos have beaks, so this *is* associated with them.
* **Maoto a koaletsoeng (Scaly feet):** The passage mentions dodos have scaly feet, so this *is* associated with them.
* **Masiba (Spines):** The passage explicitly states that humans have spines, and humans *don't* resemble dinosaurs *because* of spines. Therefore, spines are *least* associated with dinosaurs in this context.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo hangata e sa nkweng e le tshobotsi e arolelanwang ya dinonyana le di-dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho behela mahe**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""Di na le mahe"" (They have teeth) as one of the features that makes some creatures resemble dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ho sebedisa maoto a mabedi a ka morao ho tsamaya (Using two feet to walk in the back):** While some dinosaurs walked on two feet, the passage says the creatures resemble T-Rex, which walked on two feet. However, this is not unique to dinosaurs.
* **C: Bokgoni ba ho fofa (The ability to roar):**  The passage states that humans don't roar because they don't have a larynx (masiba) like dinosaurs.  While some dinosaurs might have roared, the passage *doesn't* say that the creatures resembling dinosaurs roar.
* **D: Maoto a nang le manala (Feet with claws):** The passage mentions ""maoto a e nang le makgakgapha le dinala"" (feet with claws and nails). While claws are common in dinosaurs, this isn't *as* unique a feature as teeth.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo efe ya semela sa-cycad e ka jewang ke Triceratops?","The correct answer is **A: Makgasi a hlabang (Flattened cones)**.

The passage states: ""Dimela tsena di shebahala jwaloka difate tse nyane tsa dipalema tse nang le korone ya makgasi a ntjhotjho, a hlabang."" This directly indicates that Triceratops ate the flattened cones (makgasi a hlabang) of the cycad plant.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ka jewang ke Triceratops? ","The correct answer is **B: Semela se nang le makala a thata**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that scientists believe Triceratops ate **cycads**, which are described as ""semela o neng o atile mehleng ya boholoholo e bitswang Cretaceous. Dimela tsena di shebahala jwaloka difate tse nyane tsa dipalema tse nang le korone ya makgasi a ntjhotjho, a hlabang."" (cycads, which existed during the Cretaceous period. These plants look like small palm-like ferns with a crown of cone-like scales, a trunk.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sloth:** While the passage mentions sloths eating cones and cycads, it's not presented as a food source for Triceratops according to the scientists' current understanding.
* **C: papakgaeye:**  The passage only mentions papakgaeye (a small dinosaur relative) as potentially eating cones or roots, not as food for Triceratops.
* **D: Semela se nang le tholwana e tjhefo:** While some dinosaurs *might* have eaten roots, the passage doesn't state that Triceratops ate roots. The primary food source identified is cycads.



"
"Ho latela temanaseratswana, ke papadi efe ho e latelang eo e ka nnang yaba e tumme haholo dibakeng tse ka leboya-botjhabela ho Italy?","The correct answer is **D: Mojaho wa dikoloi F1**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dipapadi tsa mariha di tumme haholo dibakeng tse ka Leboya, moo Mataliana a hlodisanang dipapading tsa matjhaba le diketsahalong tsa Olympic."" This translates to ""Motor sports are very popular in the European region, where Italy combines national sports and Olympic competitions.""  Formula 1 (F1) is a major form of motor sport.
"
"Ho latela boitsebiso bo fanweng serapeng sena, ke papadi efe ho e latelang e ileng ya baka hore Italy e hape tlhodidisanong ya lefatshe?","The correct answer is **A: Bolo ya maoto (Football)**.

The text states: ""Sehlopha sa papadi ya bolo ya maoto ya maoto sa Italy, hammoho le sehlopha sa naha sa bolo ya maoto sa Jeremane ke sehlopha sa bobedi se atlehileng haholo lefatsheng mme se ile sa hapa Mohope wa Lefatshe wa FIFA ka 2006.""  This directly indicates that Italy won the FIFA World Cup with **football**. The question asks which sport Italy won the *next* world cup in, implying that football is the sport they are associated with winning world cups.
"
Ke ka mora ketsahalo efe dikarolo tse ding tsa Luxembourg di ileng tsa fetoha tsa Belgian?,"The correct answer is **B: Phetohelo ya Belgian**.

The passage states: ""Dikarolo tse ding tsa Belgium ya kajeno e ne e le karolo ya Luxembourg nakong e fetileng empa ebile tsa Belgium kamora Phetoho ya Belgium dilemong tsa bo1830."" (Parts of present-day Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg but became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s).
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ileng ya ama ho se nke lehlakore ha Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Mosebetsi wa Jeremane (German occupation)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Luxembourg was occupied by Germany during both World War I and World War II. This directly means they *didn't* have self-determination or independence during those periods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho ikopanya le European Union (Joining the European Union):** This is a later event in Luxembourg's history, *after* the period of not being independent.
* **C: Phetohelo ya Belgian (Belgian Revolution):** While parts of modern-day Belgium were once part of Luxembourg, the revolution itself didn't directly impact Luxembourg's lack of independence; rather, it led to the creation of Belgium from territories that *included* parts of Luxembourg.
* **D: Ho ba naha e ikemetseng (Becoming an independent nation):**  The passage explicitly states Luxembourg gained full sovereignty in 1839, meaning it *did* become an independent nation at that point.



"
Ke dikhilomithara tse kae tsa disekoere-khilomithara tsa sebaka sohle sa Turkey se Europe?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""...disekwere khilomithara tse 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) di Yuropa."" This directly answers the question of how many square kilometers of Turkey's European territory there are.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, Turkey e bolelele ba dikhilomithara tse kae?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Naha ya Turkey e bolelelele bo fetang dikhilomithara tse 1,600 (1,000 mi)..."" which translates to ""Turkey's length is over 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles)...""
"
Puo ya Setadiana e sebedisetswang Toropong ya Vatican?,"The correct answer is **D: Puisano ya semmuso**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Toropo ya Vatican e sebedisa Setaliana molaong wa sona le dipuisanong tsa mmuso."" This translates to ""The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and government communications."" Government communication falls under the umbrella of official language use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mekete ya bodumedi (Friendly markets):** While Italian might be used in markets, the text doesn't specify this as the primary use.
* **B: Puo ya ka mehla (Everyday language):** While Italian *is* used in everyday life, the text specifically mentions its use in laws and government.
* **C: Molao wa tsamaiso (Administrative law):** While Italian is used in laws, the question asks about *where* it is used, and the text points to government communications.



"
"Toropong ya Vatican, Setadiana ha se sebedisetswe eng?","The correct answer is **A: Molao wa tsamaiso** (Law of administration).

The text states that the Vatican City uses Italian as its official language and in government communications. It also mentions Italian is commonly used in markets. However, it *doesn't* say Italian is used for the law of administration. Therefore, the answer is A.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e ruang molemo ka ho kopanya molumo dik’homputha tse tswetseng pele?","The correct answer is **A: Mmino**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mmino hangata o rekotuwa ho sebediswa dik’homputha tse rarahaneng ho tsamaisa le ho kopantsha medumo.""  This translates to: ""Music is often recorded using computers to manage and create music.""

Therefore, the passage directly links music recording to the use of computers.  The other options are mentioned as things computers *can* do (edit video, handle audio/video files), but not as something commonly recorded *with* computers.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke sebakeng sefe seo boholo ba matlo a neng a na le matlwana a nang le metsi?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The question explicitly states: ""Ditoropokgolo tsa Harappa le Mohenjo-daro di ne di na le ntlwana ya metsi ho batlang e le ntlong e nngwe le e nngwe..."" which translates to ""The Harappa and Mohenjo-daro cities had a bathroom in each house...""

While the other options mention bathhouses, the passage directly links the presence of bathhouses to Mohenjo-daro. The question asks *where* the bathhouses were found, and Mohenjo-daro is the only location directly mentioned in that context.
"
Ke dibakeng dife ho tse latelang moo tsamaiso ya dikgwerekgwere e tswetseng pele e ileng ya fumanwa?,"The correct answers are **B: Santorini, C: Egepeta, and D: China**.

The question asks where sophisticated sewage systems were found, and the passage mentions these locations. Harappa is mentioned as an example, but the question asks for *other* locations besides Harappa.

Therefore, B, C, and D are all correct.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e etsang hore motho ya thellisang a fetohe?,"The correct answer is **A: Mokobeho o monyane botlaseng ba lehare la ho theledisa (A small wobble at the base of the binding)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that a small wobble at the base of the binding causes the skateboarder to lean. This is because the wobble leads to the binding rubbing against the board, causing the skateboarder to adjust their weight and lean.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maqhubu a mabedi haufi le lehare la ho theledisa (Two trucks close to the binding)**: While the position of trucks *can* affect stability, the passage specifically highlights the wobble at the base of the binding as the primary cause of leaning.
*   **C: Maemo a kakaretso a sebapadi sa ho theledisa (The overall position of the binding)**: This is too general. The passage focuses on a specific *wobble* rather than the overall position.
*   **D: Boleng ba leqhwa (The quality of the board)**: The passage mentions the quality of the board allows for good grip, but doesn't directly link board quality to *causing* the skateboarder to lean. The lean is related to binding wobble.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo sekoti se lehareng la theledisa ya leqhweng?","The correct answer is **D: Se sekamisitswe (Deformed)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the shape of the skate's core is crucial for its performance. It states that if the core deforms (sekamisitswe), the skate becomes unstable and the rider loses control. The options relate to the condition of the core:

*   **A: Se mahlakoreng a mabedi (Two-layered):** This describes the construction, not the issue described in the passage.
*   **B: Se kobehile (Bulged):**  While a bulge could cause problems, the passage focuses on *deformation* which is a more general term for a change in shape.
*   **C: Se kobehetse ka hare (Cracked internally):** This is a specific type of damage, not the general issue described.
*   **D: Se sekamisitswe (Deformed):**  This directly aligns with the passage's description of how a change in the core's shape leads to instability and loss of control. The passage says ""Hobane bokatlase ba mofeng bo kobehile hanyane, ha mofeng o sekame lehlakoreng kapa ho le leng, mothati o thetsang leqhwa le wona o a kobeha."" This shows deformation, which is the most fitting description.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mokhwa ofe o dumellang diathomo ho tlosa matla a mangata a tswang leseding ?","The correct answer is **B: Ho hlahiswa ha di-photons (Emission of photons)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Di tlameha ho tlosa eneji ya tlatsetso eo di e fumaneng ho tswa kganyeng. Di etsa sena kaho ntsha thokolwana e nyane ya kganya e bitswang """"photon""""."" (They need to release the energy they obtained from the light. They do this by emitting a tiny packet of light called a ""photon"".)

The passage then explains that this process is called ""stimulated emission of radiation"" and that photons are the resulting light.  Therefore, the process of emitting photons is the mechanism by which atoms release energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mahlaseli (Attacks/Strikes)** - This isn't a scientific term related to atomic energy release.
* **C: Photon** - A photon is a *particle* of light, not the *process* of releasing energy.
* **D: Kgothaletso ya ho ntsha radiation (Stimulated emission of radiation)** - While this describes *how* the process works, it doesn't describe *what* allows the energy release.  The emission of photons *is* the key mechanism.



"
Ke eng e etsang hore atom e ntshe photon?,"The correct answer is **B: Kgothatso e bakwang ke kganya e phatsimang (Stimulation by strong radiation)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Borasaense ba bitsa tshebetso ena """"stimulated emission of radiation"""" hobane di-atom di hlasimollwa ke kganya e matla, e leng se bakang ho ntshwa ha photon ya kganya..."" (Scientists call this process ""stimulated emission of radiation"" because atoms are stimulated by strong radiation, which causes the emission of a photon of light...).

Therefore, the atom is stimulated by strong radiation to release a photon.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e tla qetella e entse hore tleloubu e kgaotse ho sebetsa?","The correct answer is **A: Lebone ha le tingwe ka nepo** (The filament was not inserted properly).

Here's why:

The passage states that the filament might break because the extruder needs to be cleaned and the filament needs to be re-inserted.  It also emphasizes the danger of a partially inserted filament and the need to ensure the metal part of the filament is fully within the socket to avoid electrical hazards.  Therefore, the most likely cause of the filament breaking is not inserting it correctly.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Ho se kenye tleloubu ka ho feletseng soketeng** (Not inserting the filament fully into the socket): This is a *contributing factor* to problems, and the passage warns against it, but the question asks what *ultimately* caused the filament to stop working.  A fully inserted filament *should* be working.
* **C: Kgwele e ka hare ho tleloubu e tuka** (A snake might be inside the filament and it is broken):  The passage doesn't mention any snakes or internal damage to the filament.
* **D: Phallo ya motlakase ho sokete e a fokotseha** (The power output to the socket is reduced): The passage focuses on the physical insertion of the filament, not electrical power issues.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ka bang kotsi ho e tshwara ha u tjhentjha tleloubu?,"The correct answer is **B: Polaka ya lebone**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states that the filament polaka (housing/shell) is a potential hazard.** It mentions the risk of electric shock if the metal part of the filament touches the inside of the socket before the filament is fully inserted.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kgwele (Cable):** While cables can be a general safety concern, the text focuses specifically on the filament's housing.
* **C: Motheo wa tleloubu (Filament core):** The core itself isn't directly described as a hazard during the tightening process.
* **D: Mohala (Heat):** While heat can be a factor when working with 3D printers, the text's primary concern during tightening is the risk of electric shock.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho etsahalang ha kgubu e arotswe?","The correct answer is **B: Matla a lokollwa**.

Here's why:

* **Nuclear fission** is the process where a heavy nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei.
* **Energy is released** during fission. This energy comes from the conversion of a small amount of mass into a large amount of energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation E=mc².
* While protons and neutrons are indeed released (A and D), the most defining and immediate outcome of fission is the release of a significant amount of energy.
*  (C) is incorrect because the resulting nuclei are typically *also* unstable, but the primary immediate effect is energy release.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e bontshang mehala e melele ho khutlela Lefatsheng,"The correct answer is **D: Dirokete**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what *returns* to Earth.** The passage explicitly states that the satellite is launched into space by a rocket.  Therefore, the rocket is the one that returns to Earth.
* The telescope, satellite, and even the astronaut are in space for the purpose of observation and research, and not to be returned.



"
Ke efe ho tsee e sebediswang ho beha ditheleskoupe sepakapakeng?,"The correct answer is **B: Dirokete**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Sathalaete e rometswe sepakapakeng ka rokete."" (The satellite was sent to space by a rocket.)
* It also mentions the rocket's height: ""Ho hlokeha rokete e kgolohadi bo fetana maoto a 100 ka bophahamo ho e jarisa theleskoupe sepakapakeng."" (A powerful rocket is needed to launch the space telescope 100 miles high.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mahlasedi a kganyang (Telescopic lenses):** While telescopes are used in space, the question asks about *how* they are placed in space. Telescopes themselves don't launch into space.
* **C: Sepakapaka sa lefatshe (Earth spacecraft):**  The passage refers to a *satellite*, not an Earth spacecraft.
* **D: Disathelaete tse bohole ba maoto a fetang 100 (High-altitude satellites):**  While the satellite is high-altitude, the question asks *what is used to put it there*. The answer is a rocket.



"
Ke eng e lokelang ho hlokomelwa ka ketsahalo ya potoloho e le hore ho latelwe ho feta ha nako?,"The correct answer is **B: pheta-phetwa (repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ketsahalo e potolohang ke ntho e etsahalang nako le nako kgafetsa."" This translates to ""A recurring event is something that happens time and again frequently.""

The question asks what should be paid attention to in a recurring event to track time.  The key element for tracking time with a recurring event is its **repetition** (pheta-phetwa).  By observing how often the event repeats, you can understand the passage of time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nako (Time):** While time is the subject, it's not *what* you pay attention to *in* the event itself.
* **C: Ama (Connects/binds):** The word ""ama"" refers to connecting things, which is not relevant to tracking time through a recurring event.
* **D: Bothata (Problems):** Problems aren't inherently related to measuring or tracking time.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo efe ya ketsahalo eo nako e sebediswang ho bapisa?","The correct answer is **B: pheta-phetwa (repetition)**.

The passage states: ""Ketsahalo e potolohang ke ntho e etsahalang nako le nako kgafetsa."" This translates to: ""A recurring event is something that happens again and again frequently.""  The passage goes on to say that time is measured by the repetition of events. Therefore, repetition (pheta-phetwa) is the key element used to measure time.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e nkwang e tloaelehile bakeng sa mojalefa teroneng?","The correct answer is **B: Ho tlohela univesithi ho kena sesoleng**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while it was expected of a nobleman to go to the army after school, Charles *did* go to university (Trinity College, Cambridge). This implies that attending university is a deviation from the usual path.
* The passage then details Charles's university studies and degree.
* Therefore, the sentence ""Ka tlwaelo, mohlahlami boreneng o ne a leba ka kotloloho sesoleng kamora ho qeta sekolo"" (By custom, a nobleman was expected to go to the army after finishing school) establishes the usual expectation.
* The question asks what is *usually* done by a nobleman.  The passage *directly* states the usual path is the army.  While Charles deviated, the question isn't asking about Charles's specific choices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho fumana degree ya 2:2:** While Charles obtained a 2:2, the passage doesn't suggest this is the typical outcome.  It focuses on the *fact* he went to university.
* **C: Ho Ithuta Histori:**  Charles studied History, but the passage doesn't indicate this is a typical subject for nobles.
* **D: Ho ya yunivesithing pele o kena sesoleng:** This is the reverse of the usual expectation. The passage says the *custom* is army *then* potentially university.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the passage's information is that going to the army after school was the standard expectation.  While not explicitly stated as a choice, **B: Ho tlohela univesithi ho kena sesoleng** is the best answer available given the choices, since the passage highlights Charles's unusual path of going to university *instead* of the army. However, it's important to note that the question is phrased poorly.



"
"Ho latela dintlha tse fanweng serapeng, Charles e bile wa pele wa ho etsa eng?","The correct answer is **C: Ho fumana lengolo la degree**.

The passage states: ""Charles ebile setho sa pele sa Lelapa la Boreneng la Brithani sa ho fuwa lengolo la degree."" This directly translates to ""Charles was the first person in the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.""
"
Dikepe tsa Trygvasson di ne di tswa naheng efe?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The text explicitly states: ""Letoto lena la dipalangwang tsa mabotho le ne le eteletswe pele ke Olaf Trygvasson, e leng **moNorway** ya nang le ditabatabelo..."" (This raiding party was led by Olaf Trygvasson, who was **from Norway**...).
"
Ke nakong efe historing moo Jeremane e bileng le tshusumetso e matla ya setso Estonia?,"The correct answer is **C: Hoo e ka bang dilemo tse 600 tse fetileng**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hoo ekabang ngwahakgolo wa bo15... Banna ba bang ba baitlami ba Majeremane ba ne ba batla ho tlisa Modimo haufi le matswallwa a moo, kahoo ba qapa puo ya Seestonia ya lentswe ka lentswe... Eo ebile qaleho ya kutlwisiso e feletseng.""  The development of the Estonian language and its connection to German influence occurred over a significant period, spanning centuries. 600 years is a reasonable estimate considering the gradual process of language development described. The other options (200, 400, and 800 years) are less likely given the described timeline.
"
Puo ya SeEstonia e ile ya susumetswa ke eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Alfabeta ya Sejeremane**.

The passage explicitly states: ""E ne e thehilwe ho alfabete ya Sejeremane..."" which translates to ""It was based on the German alphabet...""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, palo ya batho ba buang se-Hindi e feto-fetoha ho latela ntlha efe?","The correct answer is **C: Haeba ho balwa batho ba kgonang ho utlwisisa puo.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Palo ya matswallwa a buang puo ena e fapana ho itshetlehile ka hore na ho balwa le batho ba buang mefuta ya puo e haufiufi le puo eo."" (The number of speakers of this language varies depending on whether those who speak closely related languages are counted.)

And later: ""mme batho ba ka bang dimilione tse 800 ba ka utlwisisa puo ena."" (and about 800 million people can understand this language.)

This means the count depends on *who* is being counted – those who speak Hindi, those who speak related languages, or those who can *understand* Hindi.
"
Ke polelo efe ho tse latelang eo e leng nnete ka dipuo tsa Se-Hindi le Se-Urdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Di fapane ka mongolo**

The text explicitly states: ""Mantswe a puo ya Sehindi le a Seurdu aa tshwana empa a ngolwa ka tsela e sa tshwaneng"" which translates to ""The words of Hindi and Urdu are similar but are written differently.""
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang eo e seng nnete e nepahetseng ka alfabeta ya Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **D: E qapilwe ka boomo** (It was invented by chance).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Alefabeta ena e ile ya qapuwa ka selemo sa 1444 nakong ya puso ya Morena Sejong..."" (This alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong...) This indicates it was deliberately invented.
* **Options A, B, and C are all true according to the passage:**
    * **A:** The passage explicitly states it was invented during King Sejong's reign.
    * **B:** The passage states the original name was Hunmin Jeongeum.
    * **C:** The passage describes King Sejong as the ruler of the Joseon Dynasty.
* **D:**  The passage doesn't mention it was invented by chance.  It emphasizes the deliberate creation by King Sejong.



Therefore, the statement that Hangeul was invented by chance is the incorrect one."
Alfabeta ya Hunmin Jeongeum e ile ya qetella e fetoletswe ho eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The text states that Hunmin Jeongeum is the original name for the alphabet that is now known as Hangeul.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke dipuo dife tse susumeditsweng ke Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **A: Dipuo tsa Selatine**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sesanskrit ke puo ya kgale mme e bapiswa le puo ya Selatine se buuwang Yuropa."" (Sanskrit is an ancient language and is related to the Latin spoken in Europe.) While it also mentions European languages, the direct relationship is to Latin.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, tshebediso ya Sanskrit e ile ya fokotseha ka lebaka la eng?","The correct answer is **C: Dipuo tsa Selatine**.

The passage states: ""Sesanskrit se ile sa nyamela ka lebaka la maemo a sona papisong le dipuo tse ding.""  These ""dipuo tse ding"" are later explained to be the languages of the Indo-European family, specifically mentioning Latin as a source language for European languages like French and Spanish. Therefore, the decline of Sanskrit was due to the rise and prominence of these other languages.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho rarahana (Scarcity):** While possibly a contributing factor, the passage doesn't explicitly state scarcity as the primary reason.
*   **B: Ho falla ha Aryan (The Aryan migration):** The Aryan migration is mentioned as the *origin* of Sanskrit in India, not the reason for its decline.
*   **D: Boemo bo phahameng (High status):** The passage states Sanskrit *had* a high status, but this did not prevent its decline. In fact, the passage implies its high status was part of the reason it eventually lost prominence.

"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e leng polelo e nepahetseng mabapi le matla a kgohedi a ho Io?","The correct answer is **B: Matla a kgohedi a Io a hula ho feta, ke ka lebaka leo o ka fokolang.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""Haeba o ne o ka ema kgweding ya Io, boima ba hao bo ne bo tla fokotseha ha ho bapiswa le ha o le Lefatsheng."" (If you could stand on Io, your weight would decrease relative to Earth.)
* **This implies:** Io's gravitational pull is weaker than Earth's.
* **Therefore:** The gravitational pull of Io would exert less force on you, resulting in you feeling lighter.  So, Io's gravity *would* pull on you, but not as strongly as Earth's, meaning it would ""hula ho feta"" (pull more on you relative to your reduced weight).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matla a kgohedi a lefatshe a ne a tla o hula hanyane ho feta matla a kgohedi a Io:** The passage directly contradicts this. Earth's gravity is *stronger* than Io's.
* **C: Matla a kgohedi a Io a hula ho feta, ke ka lebaka leo o neng u ka lekanya ho feta:** The passage says you'd *decrease* in weight, not measure *more*.
* **D: Matla a kgohedi a lefatshe a ne a tla o hula ho feta matla a kgohedi a Io:**  Again, the passage clearly indicates Earth's gravity is *stronger*.

"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang e hlalosang ka nepo lera le ka ntle la Kwgedi?","The correct answer is **A: Lehlakore le haufi le na le bokahodimodimo bo teteaneng**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kgwedi e entswe ka majwe le lerole. Karolo e kantle ya Kgwedi e bitswa bokantle. Bokantle bo botenya bo ka bang 70 km ka lehlakoreng le ka haufi mme le botenya ba 100 km lehlakoreng le hole."" This tells us the central part (bokantle) is much thicker near the edge (lehlakore le haufi) than it is further away.
* **The passage also says:** ""Ho ka nna ha eba le diphula tse leng ho kgwedi tse ngata ka lehlakoreng le haufi hobane bokantle bo bosesaane. Ho ne ho le bonolo hore seretse se tjhesang se nyolohele hodimo."" This indicates that the thinner central part near the edge makes it easier for storms to rise.
* **Therefore:** The region near the edge of the Kwgedi (lehlakore le haufi) has a more ""dense"" or thick (bohahodimodimo bo teteaneng) structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lekhapetla le lesesaane tlasa dibaka tse phahameng:** The passage doesn't mention anything about a ""lekhapetla"" (shelter) or ""dibaka tse phahameng"" (higher places) under the Kwgedi.
* **C: Ho ka nna ha e-ba le maria a fokolang ka lehlakoreng le hole:** The passage doesn't discuss rainfall patterns and specifically mentions the central part being thicker near the edge.
* **D: Ho ka nna ha e-ba le maria a fokolang tlasa dibaka tse phahameng:**  Again, the passage doesn't address rainfall under higher places.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, bokahodimo ba kgwedi bo botenya kae ka ho fetisisa?","The correct answer is **A: Ka lehlakoreng le haufi**.

The text states: ""Bokantle bo botenya bo ka bang 70 km ka lehlakoreng le ka haufi mme le botenya ba 100 km lehlakoreng le hole."" This directly indicates that the thickness of the core is greatest at the near side of the Moon.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang e lumelwang ke batho ba itseng?","The correct answer is **A: Batho ba ile dinaleding tse ding (People have been to other planets)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Batho ba bangata ba lora ka nako eo ba tla kgonang ho ya naleding e nngwe mme ba bone le mafatshe a mang..."" which translates to ""Many people dream of going to another planet and seeing another world...""  The key point is the *dream* or aspiration, and the question asks what is *believed* by some people.
* The passage implies that people believe it *could* happen eventually, but they haven't gotten there yet.
* Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:
    * B: The passage doesn't say people *can't* explore other worlds, just that it might take a long time.
    * C: The passage doesn't explicitly state belief in extraterrestrial life. It mentions the possibility but doesn't affirm belief.
    * D: The passage says there are trillions of miles *between* planets, not kilometers.  It's also a factual statement, not a belief.



"
Ke eng e ntseng e fokola ha o tloha setsing sa Letsatsi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kgase**.

The text states: ""Ha o kenella hare ho tloha kgubung ya Letsatsi, kgase e ba tshesane le ho feta."" (If you enter from the Sun's atmosphere, the gas becomes denser and denser.)

While plasma and mollo are present in the Sun, the question specifically asks what *decreases* as you move *into* the Sun from its atmosphere.  The density of **gas** increases as you go deeper.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke karolo efe ya letsatsi e bonahalang ho tswa Lefatsheng?","The correct answer is **C: photosphere**.

The passage states: ""Karolo e ka hodimo eo re e bonang Letsatsi e bitswa photosphere..."" which translates to ""The upper part that we see of the Sun is called the photosphere...""
"
Ke dintlha dife ho tse latelang tse ileng tsa thusa ho tiisa kgopolo ya Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Mekgahlelo ya Venus (Phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **Phases of Venus:** Galileo's observation of Venus exhibiting phases (like the Moon) was a *direct* contradiction to the Ptolemaic model (which placed Earth at the center).  If Venus phases, it implies it orbits the Sun, just like the Moon orbits the Earth.  This was strong evidence supporting Copernicus's heliocentric theory.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **Ho tsamaya ha Venus (Venus's motion):** While Venus's motion *was* observed and studied, it wasn't the primary, groundbreaking evidence.  It's a supporting detail but not as impactful as the phases.  It was also difficult to explain within the Ptolemaic system.
* **Ho tshwana ha Letsatsi le Venus (Similarity between the Sun and Venus):** The similarity in size and composition between the Sun and Venus isn't directly related to proving heliocentrism.
* **Ho tshwana ha Letsatsi le Kgwedi (Similarity between the Sun and the Moon):** This is not relevant to proving the heliocentric model.

Therefore, the discovery of Venus's phases provided the most compelling and immediate support for Copernicus's heliocentric theory.



"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ileng ya hlokomelwa ke Galileo Galilei ka-1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Mekgahlelo ya Venus**.

The passage states that Galileo Galilei observed that Venus had phases similar to the Moon. This observation was the key discovery he made in 1610. Options A, C, and D are either consequences of the observation or later discoveries, but not what Galileo directly observed in 1610.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, Noka ya Amazon e bokella metsi hokae?","The correct answer is **A: Dinokeng tse nyane**.

The text states: ""Amazon hape ke noka e bokella metsi ho tswa dinokeng tse nyenyane tse dikete-kete."" which translates to ""Amazon also collects water from small rivers.""
"
Ke thoriso efe e sa amaneng le Noka ya Amazon?,"The correct answer is **D: Ke noka e sephara (It's a floating river)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes the Amazon as the longest and largest river in the world.
* It mentions its extensive length, volume of water, and its source in smaller rivers.
* The passage *doesn't* describe the Amazon as a floating river. Rivers are flowing bodies of water, not floating.

The other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

* **A: Ke noka ya bobedi e telele ka ho fetisisa (It's the second longest river):** The passage states this directly.
* **B: Ke noka e kgolohadi (It's a giant river):** The passage describes the Amazon as very large.
* **C: Ke noka e telele ka ho fetisisa (It's the longest river):** The passage states this directly.



"
Ke mosebetsi ofe o boletsweng serapeng o sebedisang palo e fokolang ya batho ba Venezuela?,"The correct answer is **A: Temong**.

The text states: ""hoo ekabang kotara e sebetsa difemeng athe a le mong ho ba bahlano o sebetsa temong."" This translates to ""where a quarter works in companies, and only one in five works in restaurants."" This directly indicates that the restaurant industry has a low percentage of working Venezuelans.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang tse sebedisang palo e kgolo ya batho ba Venezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Tshebeletso (Services)**.

Here's why:

* The text states ""Mavenezuela a etsang 18% ha a sebetse..."" which means 18% of Venezuelans are employed. This refers to the overall **service sector** as the primary area of employment, considering the other details about people working in healthcare and food service. 
* While other options are mentioned, they are specific sub-sectors within the broader service sector. The 18% figure represents the largest overall portion of the workforce.
* The other options (Temong, Indasteri, Oli) are specific examples of sectors within the economy, but not the largest overall employer according to the provided text.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho kopana ha dinutlelie ho dumella dinaledi ho etsa eng?","The correct answer is **A: Theha dikarolo tse boima (Create heavier elements)**.

The passage states: ""Dinaledi di hlahisa kganya le otjheso ka lebaka la eneji e entsweng ha di-atom tsa haedrojine di kopana (kapa di matahana) mmoho ho theha dielemente tse boima ho feta.""  This translates to: ""Stars produce energy due to the energy released when hydrogen atoms combine (fuse) together to form heavier elements.""

Therefore, the fusion of hydrogen atoms creates heavier elements.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e ka hlahiswang ke mohlodi wa matla a motlakase?,"The correct answer is **D: Matla (Energy)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes the process of releasing energy when hydrogen atoms combine to form heavier elements.
* The ultimate product of this process, and what a power reactor aims to harness, is **energy**. 
* While hydrogen, elements, and atoms are involved in the process, the *outcome* is the generation of energy.



Therefore, the most accurate answer from the given options is **Matla (Energy)**.
"
Moetso wa dik’hemik’hale wa metsi ke ofe?,"The correct answer is **D: Diathomo tse pedi tsa haedrojene le athomo e le nngwe ya oksijene**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Metsi ke mohlala o mong. Metsi wa metsi o entswe ka diathomo tse pedi tsa haedrojene le athomo e le nngwe ya oksijene."" (Water is another example. Water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.)
"
"Ha metsi a fetoha, ke eng e tla lula e tshwana?","The correct answer is **A: Sebopeho sa dimolek'hule**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that even though the physical state (gas, liquid, solid) of a substance can change, the *molecular structure* remains the same.  The example of water is used to illustrate this: H2O remains H2O regardless of whether it's liquid water or ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Botenya:**  Water's density changes depending on temperature.
* **C: Boemo ba mmele:** The passage states that the physical state (boemo ba mmele) *can* change (e.g., from liquid to gas).
* **D: Naetrojene e metsi:** Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, not nitrogen.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A: Sebopeho sa dimolek'hule**."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho tse latelang eo e neng e se taba bakeng sa dinaha tse leshome le metso e meraro ha di leka ho beha melao e itseng?","The correct answer is **B: Ho hloka matla ka hare ho Congress.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ho hang Congress e ne e se na matla a ho qobella batho ho lefa makgetho..."" and ""...e ne e itshetlehile ka balaodi ba phahameng ba dinaha, bao hangata ba neng ba sa sebedisane...""  This directly points to a lack of power *within* Congress itself, making it difficult to enact laws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tlhokomelo e boima ho tswa ho balaodi ba mmuso:** While the passage mentions reliance on governors, it doesn't highlight the governors themselves as the primary obstacle to lawmaking.  The core problem is Congress's weakness.
* **C: Ditokiso tse hlokang tumello e le nngwe:**  The passage doesn't mention any requirements for unanimous approval of laws.  In fact, it says laws needed unanimous consent from *all* states to be changed.
* **D: Phethahatso ya naha e seng teng:**  The passage focuses on the weaknesses of the *existing* government structure, not the lack of a unified national identity.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke polelo efe e bontshang ka nepo boemo ba mmuso o bohareng nakong ya Ntwa ya Phetohelo?","The correct answer is **C: Baemedi ba naha ba ne ba sa be teng**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""e ne e itshetlehile ka balaodi ba phahameng ba dinaha, bao hangata ba neng ba sa sebedisane..."" (it was reliant on the high officials of the states, who often did not cooperate...). This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Makgetho a ne a qobellwa ke Congress le balaodi ba naha:** While Congress *tried* to compel states to pay taxes, the passage says it *could not*. This makes the statement inaccurate.
* **B: Ditokiso ho Dingollwa di ne di itshetlehile ka matla a Congress:** The passage implies the opposite – Congress lacked the power to enforce laws and treaties.
* **D: Mmuso o moholo o ne o e-na le dikarolo tse pedi tsa sehlooho:** The passage describes a weak, centralized government, not a federal system with distinct branches.

Therefore, option C is the only one accurately reflecting the weakness and lack of a strong central authority during the Articles of Confederation.
"
Mantswe a ka morao ho Phatlalatso ya Boikemelo a ngotswe jwang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka mongolo o moholo (In large handwriting)**.

The text explicitly states: ""ha tokomane ena e ngoletsweng moqolong o moholo (e boholo ba ditswe tse 29¾ ka ditswe tse 24½) e sa le ntjha, e ne e thatetswe hore e bolokwe."" (this parchment was written in large handwriting (with dimensions of 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) and was preserved).
"
Singapore e tumme ka efe ho tse latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Botala ba ditoropong (Gardens City)**.

The text explicitly states that Singapore Botanic Gardens helped transform the country into a ""Garden City"" in the tropics. Therefore, the answer is A.
"
Vanda Miss Joaquim ke eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Palesa**.

The passage states: ""1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, e leng orchid ya motswako, e ile ya kgethwa e le **palesa** ya naha e ratwang ke setjhaba."" which translates to ""1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a native orchid, was chosen to be the **national flower** of the country.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke boleng bofe ba diphiramide tsa Giza bo neng bo ke ke ba hlolla ho Baegepeta ba New Kingdom?","The correct answer is **C: Boholo ba tsona** (Their size).

The passage states that the pyramids of Giza were unsurpassed in size and artistic brilliance, and that the Egyptians of the New Kingdom were awestruck by them, having stood for over six thousand years. This implies that the sheer size of the pyramids was something that impressed and perhaps even intimidated the later Egyptians.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Dilemo tsa tsona (Their age):** While the age is mentioned, the passage focuses on the *impact* of the pyramids, not necessarily the age itself as the overwhelming factor.
* **B: Tshebediso ya majwe (Their craftsmanship):**  The passage mentions artistic brilliance but doesn't explicitly state craftsmanship was the most impressive element.
* **D: Kaho ya tsona (Their design):**  While the design is part of the artistic brilliance, the passage emphasizes the overwhelming size as the primary reason for awe.



"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, diphoofolo tse jang ditlama di tloha kae ho lelekisa pula?","The correct answer is **D: Maralla a bophirimela**.

The passage states: ""...ebe di leba ka leboya hape di se di hlaha ka bophirimela..."" which translates to ""...and they also graze when it is rainy in the north..."". This indicates that the animals graze in the rainy areas of the north. The question asks where they go to check for rain. The passage links them grazing in the north to checking the rainy lands in the north, therefore the answer is the rainy lands in the north, which are located in the **bophirimela (north)**.

Therefore, the correct option is **D: Maralla a bophirimela**."
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke sebaka sefe seo diphoofolo tse jang dimela di tlohang ho sona nako e nngwe ka bo Mmesa?","The correct answer is **C: Noka ya Mara**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ebe di tshela Noka ya Mara, di hlaha dihlabeng tse ka leboya ka lebaka la dipula. Ebe di leba ka leboya hape di se di hlaha ka bophirimela, di boetse di tshela Noka ya Mara, kamora sehla sa dipula ho elella kgweding ya Mmesa.""

This means the animals migrate to the Mara River (Noka ya Mara) for grazing and then return to it after the rains in May.  Therefore, they are at the Mara River at the same time in May.

While the Serengeti and Maasai Mara are mentioned as important locations, the question specifically asks where the animals go *at the same time* in May.
"
Operation ya Sealion e ne e le tlhaselo ya naha efe?,"The correct answer is **A: Jeremane**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ha ntwa ya ho tseka Fora e letse, Jeremane e ile ya itokisetsa ho hapa sehlekehleke sa Brithani. Majeremane a ile a reha tlhaselo eo “Operation Sealion”."" (After the invasion of France failed, Germany prepared to launch an invasion of Britain. The Germans launched the operation called ""Operation Sealion"".)
"
Jeremane e ile ya bitsa tlhaselo ya Brithani jwang?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The passage states: ""Majeremane a ile a reha tlhaselo eo “Operation Sealion”."" which translates to ""The Germans prepared the offensive as “Operation Sealion”.""
"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang e le mohato o hlokahalang morerong wa Italy wa ho hapa dinaha tsa Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: Ho tlosa dikepe Egepeta**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hore e atleha, e ne e tla lokela ho fedisa dikampo tsa Mabrithani le dikepe tse Egepeta."" (To succeed, it needed to eliminate British camps and Egyptian ships.)  The passage emphasizes this as a *necessary* step for Italian naval power to operate effectively in the Mediterranean and Africa.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ho haha dikepe tse eketsehileng:** The passage says Italy's ships were weak and it wasn't building new ones, so this isn't a necessary step.
*   **C: Ho theha sebaka sa ho qala sesole:** This is not mentioned in the passage as a requirement.
*   **D: Ho senya ditsi tsa Brithani:** While eliminating British camps is mentioned, the passage directly states the need to eliminate *ships*, not just British forces in general.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e neng e nkwa e le sepheo se ka sehloohong sa ntwa ya Italy?","The correct answer is **A: Ho hapa dinaha tsa Afrika**.

The passage states: ""Italy e ne e amehile haholoholo ka dinaha tsa Afrika."" (Italy was very interested in African lands). It also says that to achieve its goals, Italy needed to eliminate British and Egyptian fleets to control trade routes to Africa.
"
Ke mang ya thehileng dikamano tsa botswalle le bahlasedi?,"The correct answer is **B: Sefora sa Vichy**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""E ne e laolwa ke Mafora a “Vichy”. Bana batho ba Mafora ba neng a ile ba bopa kgotso le Majeremane ka 1940 mme ba sebedisana le wona ho fapana le ho a lwantsha."" This means Vichy France collaborated with the Germans.  The passage highlights their role in controlling the southern part of France.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Majeremane:** While they controlled the area initially, the question asks who had alliances.
*   **C: Maamerika:** The Americans ultimately liberated the area, but the question is about alliances at the time.
*   **D: Mafora a Lokolohileng:**  The liberated French forces were not allied with the Germans. They fought *against* them.



"
Balekane e ne e le bo mang ba neng ba ameha tshebetsong ya Operation Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Maamerika le Mafora a Lokolohileng**

The text explicitly states: ""Pada la 15 Phato 1940, Mabotho a Kopaneng a ile a hapa karolo e ka borwa ya Fora, mme tlhaselo eo e bitswa “Operation Dragoon”. **Maamerika le Mafora a Lokolohileng** a ne a lokolotse karolo e ka borwa ya Fora mme jwale a habile Jeremane.""
"
Ke kgatelo-pele ya theknoloji efe e entseng hore dikepe tse tsamayang ka tlasa metsi di qale ho tsamaya tlasa metsi?,"The correct answer is **D: Navikeitara ya ditemoso lewatleng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Qalong ya ntwa, di ne di tsamaya haholoholo ka hodima lewatle, empa ha navikeitara ya ditemoso lewatleng e ntse e ntjhafatswa, mme e nepa le ho feta, di sabomarine di ile tsa tlameha ho dula tlasa metsi hore di se ke tsa bonwa.""

This translates to: ""At the beginning of the war, they sailed quickly on the surface of the ocean, but as the detection technology at sea was being improved, they had to dive underwater to avoid being seen.""

Therefore, the improvement in surface detection technology forced submarines to start operating underwater.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di-U-Boats:** U-Boats were a *type* of submarine used by Germany. They weren't the *cause* of submarines starting to operate underwater.
*   **B: Sebaka sa ho thunya:** The ability to hide was a *result* of operating underwater, not the cause.
*   **C: Ho tsamaya ha dikepe:**  The passage is about *submarines*, not surface ships in general.

"
"Nakong ya tshebediso ya tsona ya pele, disabomarine di ne di e-na le sebaka se fokolang haholo sebakeng sefe?","The correct answer is **A: Ho tsamaya ha dikepe (During sailing)**.

The passage states: ""Qalong ya ntwa, di ne di tsamaya haholoholo ka hodima lewatle, emba ha navikeitara ya ditemoso lewatleng e ntse e ntjhafatswa, mme e nepa le ho feta, di sabomarine di ile tsa tlameha ho dula tlasa metsi hore di se ke tsa bonwa.""  This translates to: ""At the beginning of the war, they sailed rapidly on the surface of the sea, but as the naval air patrol increased and became more effective, submarines had to dive underwater to avoid being seen.""

This indicates that the submarines initially sailed on the surface, and the need to dive was a result of the increased threat of air patrols.  Therefore, the space was limited *during sailing*.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya tlotseng tumellano? ","The correct answer is **D: Ma-Soviet**.

The passage states: ""ha masole a kahodimo ho 800,000 a Lebotho le Lefubedu la Soviet Union le kena mme le etsa mela ya ntwa ya Belarussia le Ukraine kamora ho hapa dikarolo tsa Poland..."" This indicates the Soviet Union invaded and occupied parts of Poland, forcing the cancellation of agreements.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya etswa ke Lebotho le Lefubedu ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho hlophiswa botja haufi le borokgo (Reconstruction near the border)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Soviet Union *invaded* Poland, occupied territories in Belarus and Ukraine, and subsequently signed treaties that effectively partitioned Poland.  It doesn't mention any plans or actions by the Soviet Union to reconstruct areas *near the border*. The focus was on seizing territory and securing the newly acquired land.

Let's look at why the other options *were* actions taken by the Soviet Union:

*   **A: Ho thehwa ha pele ha bala la ntwa la Ukraine (The advance of the Soviet army into Ukraine):** The passage explicitly mentions the Soviet army invading and occupying parts of Ukraine.
*   **B: Tlhaselo ya dibaka tse ka botjhabela (Occupation of territories):** The passage describes the Soviet Union occupying territories in Belarus and Ukraine.
*   **D: Tlolo ya selekane (Seizure of territory):** The passage mentions the Soviet Union seizing territory, leading to the Treaty of Riga and other agreements.



"
Ho etsahetseng ka Moenjiniere e Moholo wa Lebotho la Leshome la Italy?,"The correct answer is **C: O ile a haptjwa ke Ma-Brithani** (He was captured by the British).

The text states: ""Tlhaselong ya ho tsometsa ka botjhabela ba Bardia, Maborithani a hapile Moenjineri wa Sehlooho wa Ithali ya Maemong a Leshome Lebothong la Fatshe, Mojenerale Lastucci."" (During the advance to the south of Bardia, the British captured the Italian Chief of Staff Engineer, General Lastucci.)
"
Italo Balbo o bolailwe hokae?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Q: ...Marshal Italo Balbo, Mmusisi-Kakaretso wa Libya le mohlahlami wa Mussolini, o ile a bolawa ke dikulo tse tswang ho lebotho la habo ha ba ne ba tsorama ka sefofane **Tobruk**.""
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ya mekhwa e latelang eo e leng karolo ya bohlokwa ya ho thuisa ha Tibetan?","The correct answer is **C: Ka ho bona medimo e sa tshwaneng metjha ya matla e a hlweka**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ho ya ka seratswana, ke efe ya mekhwa e latelang eo e leng karolo ya bohlokwa ya ho thuisa ha Tibetan? **Ka ho bona medimo e sa tshwaneng metjha ya matla e a hlweka, ho tsoswa di-chakra mme ho qala boikutlo ba ho behwa leseding.**""

The other options are mentioned as parts of the broader Tibetan Buddhist practice, but not specifically highlighted as *the* crucial element according to the passage. While mantras and meditation are important, the passage directly links the visualization of deities to the awakening of chakras and the feeling of energy in the body, indicating its paramount importance.
"
"""Ho ya ka seratswana, di-chakras di kenngwa jwang nakong ya """"bohareng"""" ba ho thuisa ha Tibetan?""","The correct answer is **B: Ka ho bona medimo e sa tshwaneng metjha ya matla e a hlweka**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ka ho bona medimo e sa tshwaneng metjha ya matla e a hlweka, ho tsoswa di-chakra mme ho qala boikutlo ba ho behwa leseding."" (By visualizing the powerful, divine forms, the chakras are awakened and the feeling of being rooted begins.)
"
Ke mang ya ileng a hlahisa pina ya bobedi ya borapedi nakong ya lenaneo?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

The text states: ""Sebini Sanju Sharma o qadile phirimana, a latelwa ke Jai Shankar Choudhary eo le yena a faneng ka chhappan bhog bhajan."" This translates to ""Singer Sanju Sharma sang first, followed by Jai Shankar Choudhary who also offered a chhappan bhog bhajan."" Therefore, Jai Shankar Choudhary sang the second bhajan.
"
"Ho ya ka seratswana, ke mang ya ileng a hlahisa pina ya borapedi nakong ya nyehelo ya dijo?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jwale, Lakkha Singh a etella pele ho bina di-bhajan."" which translates to ""Now, Lakkha Singh has started singing bhajans."" and later ""Lakkha Singh le yena o nyehetse ka chhappan bhog bhajan."" which translates to ""Lakkha Singh and he sang chhappan bhog bhajans"". This indicates Lakkha Singh was the one who performed the bhajan during the offering of food.
"
Ke eng e ileng ya etswa karolong ya bobedi ya ho qetela mantsiboyeng ao?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina le Haris Alexiou**.

The text states: ""Sebini sa mosadi sa moTurkey Sezen Aksu a bina tinoro ya moIthali Alessandro Safina mmoho le sebini sa Mogeriki Haris Alexiou."" which translates to ""The Turkish female singer Sezen Aksu performed alongside the Italian singer Alessandro Safina and the Greek singer Haris Alexiou."" This happens in the second to last part of the paragraph.
"
Alessandro Safina ke oa setjhaba sefe?,"The correct answer is **B: Mogerike**.

The text states that Alessandro Safina is ""tinoro ya moIthali Alessandro Safina"", which translates to ""Italian Alessandro Safina"". Therefore, he is Italian, not Turkish.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke efe ho dipolelo tse latelang eo e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Ho nkile bonyane metsotso e-60 ho theola motho wa pele.**

Here's why:

* The text states: """"ho nkile bonyane hora e le nngwe hore motho wa pele a theolwe ho """"roller coaster."""" "" (It took about an hour for the first person to be evacuated from the roller coaster.)

Therefore, option D, which says it took about 60 minutes (metsotso e-60) to evacuate, is incorrect. The text says *an hour* (hora e le nngwe).

Let's look at the other options to confirm they are true:

* **A: Ho bile le mollo Santa Clara** - The text explicitly mentions the Santa Clara wildfire.
* **B: Batho ba ne ba sitwa ho tswa ka hara di-roller coaster** - The text says people were evacuated.
* **C: Bapalami ba ne ba fuwa metsi** - The text states ""Baeti ba fuwe metsi ha ba eme motjhesong wa dikgerata tse 90(F)."" (Guests were given water while waiting in line at the 90°F ride.)



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mang ya faneng ka maikutlo mabapi le boemo bo sa thabiseng ba motjheso?","The correct answer is **B: Molaodi wa mollo**.

The text states: ""Mokaptene wa mollo Scott Kouns o itse..."" which translates to ""Fisherman Captain Scott Kouns knows...""  This indicates that Scott Kouns is the one providing the quote and therefore expressing an opinion on the uncomfortable heat.
"
Motlakase o ile wa kgaoha hokae ka lebaka la tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""...motlakase o kgaohile nakwana, e leng se tlalehwang se thibetse baetapele ba Tonga ho se fumane tlhokomediso ya tsunami e phatlaladitsweng ke PTWC."" This translates to: ""...the power surged so much that it prevented the leaders of Tonga from receiving tsunami alerts issued by PTWC.""
"
"Ho latela seratswana, Tonga e ile ya angwa jwang ke ho kgaoha ha motlakase?","The correct answer is **D: Ba boholong ha baa kgona ho fumana ditemoso tse amehang**.

The text states: ""motlakase o kgaohile nakwana, e leng se tlalehwang se thibetse baetapele ba Tonga ho se fumane tlhokomediso ya tsunami e phatlaladitsweng ke PTWC.""  This translates to: ""The power outage was so significant that it prevented Tongan leaders from receiving tsunami alerts issued by PTWC.""

Therefore, the power outage prevented them from receiving the tsunami warnings.

Mapolesa a khonne neng ho sebedisa dithunya tsa bona tsa radar ho tshwara lebelo la ho khanna la Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka lekgetlo la bosupa hodima borokgo (During a jump over a jump)**.

The text states: ""Mapolesa a New Zealand a kgonne ho sebedisa dithunya tsa bona tsa radar ya lebelo ho bona hore na Mong Reid o palame ka lebelo le lekae ka lebaka la ka moo Black Beauty e manameng fatshe ka teng..."" This indicates they were able to get a speed reading *during* the jumps. The text also mentions they got a speed reading when he slowed down from 160km/h, but the primary mention of using radar during the chase is related to the jumps.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha a ntse a kganna ka lebelo la 160km/h (While he was traveling at 160km/h):**  The text says they couldn't use radar to read his speed at 160km/h *because* the car was jumping.
* **C: Ha a ntse a kganna ho feta 160km/h (While he was traveling faster than 160km/h):** The text explicitly mentions he jumped *over* a jump, and it was at that point the police were able to use radar.
* **D: Ka lekgetlo la pele a le hodima borokgo (During the first jump):** While he jumped during the chase, the text doesn't specify it was the *first* jump they used radar on.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke hobaneng ha ho ne ho le thata hore mapolesa a New Zealand a shebe lebelo la Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **B: Koloi e ne e le tlase haholo (The car was very low)**.

The text states: ""Mapolesa a New Zealand a fumane bothata ba ho ka sebedisa dithunya tsa bona tsa radar ya lebelo ho bona hore na Mong Reid o palame ka lebelo le lekae ka lebaka la ka moo Black Beauty e manameng fatshe ka teng..."" which translates to ""New Zealand police had difficulty using their radar speed guns because of how low the Black Beauty was to the ground...""

This indicates the car's low profile interfered with the radar's ability to accurately measure its speed. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Tshisinyeho ya lefatshe e ne e le hokae kamanong le Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 dimmaele ka borwa**.

The passage states: ""...a sebaka se ka bang 65 km (dmmaele tse 40) ka borwa ho Butte.""  This translates to 40 miles north of Butte.
"
Ho etsahetseng nakong ya moferefere Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Tlhekefetso ya batshwaruoa (Torture of prisoners)**.

The question states that the Abu Ghraib scandal was revealed during a prison investigation and gained notoriety *after* US soldiers were caught. The core of the scandal was the torture of Iraqi prisoners.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lockdown:** While a lockdown might have been part of the situation, it wasn't the defining event of the scandal.
*   **C: Mabotho a-US a nkile taolo (US soldiers took control):** The US *already* had control of the prison. The scandal was about what they *did* with that control.
*   **D: Tjhankana e ile ya tjheswa (The prison was destroyed):** The prison was not destroyed. The scandal concerned abuses *within* the prison.



"
Hobaneng ha tjhankana ya Iraq e ile ya tsebahala? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ho sibollwa ha tlhekefetso ya batshwaruwa (The release of the prisoner)**.

The question asks *how* the Abu Ghraib scandal became known. The text states it became known after the release of the prisoner and the subsequent discovery by US forces.
"
Ho ne ho tla tshwarelwa ketsahalo ya mofuta ofe Lebaleng la Sehopotso la Ntwa la Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Konsarete**.

The question states that Bente was holding a **konsarete** at Maui War Memorial Stadium. The question is asking what *type* of event was being held.
"
Ke mang ya ileng a qetella a fane ka tlhaloso mabapi le ho hlakolwa ha ketsahalo eo?,"The correct answer is **C: Monga Lebala la Sehopotso sa Ntwa (The Mayor's Office)**.

The text states that Bente requested an exemption from the Mayor's Office. While HK Management Inc. initially didn't provide a reason for the postponement, the Mayor's Office eventually provided an explanation citing logistical reasons for the following day. Therefore, the Mayor's Office is the one who ultimately gave the explanation.
"
Baahi ba mmalwa ba Bishkek ba ne ba nahana hore ke mang ya ikarabellang bakeng sa boshodu boo?,"The correct answer is **C: Baipelaetsi**.

The passage states: ""Baudi ba Bishkek ba jarisitse baipelaetsi ba tswang ka borwa bakeng sa meferefere ena ya tlhokeho ya molao."" This translates to ""Several Bishkek residents hired bail bondsmen for these legal troubles.""
"
Ke mang ya ileng a beha baipelaetsi ba tswang ka borwa molato bakeng sa boshodu?,"The correct answer is **A: Baahi ba Bishkek (Residents of Bishkek)**.

The text states: ""Badudi ba Bishkek ba jarisitse baipelaetsi ba tswang ka borwa bakeng sa meferefere ena ya tlhokeho ya molao.""  This translates to ""Residents of Bishkek hired private security from the south for these security needs."" Therefore, the residents of Bishkek are the ones who hired the private security.
"
Ring e fumane thekiso e eketsehileng neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka mora ho hlaha ho QVC**.

The passage states: ""Dithekiso di phahame kamora boitlhahiso ba hae ka 2013 lenaneong la Shark Tank moo moifo wa lenaneo o ileng wa hana ho tshehetsa qalo ya kgwebo ya hae. Mafelong a 2017, Siminoff a hlaha kanaleng ya thelevishene ya tsa mabenkele ya QVC.""

This indicates that sales increased *after* appearing on QVC. While the other options are related to Ring's success, QVC is specifically mentioned as a point where sales increased.
"
Jamie Siminoff o nkile qeto ya ho qala Lesale neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka mora ponahalo ya Shark Tank e hlolehileng**.

The passage states: ""O ile a aha tshepe ya ho kokota monyako ya WiFi, a rialo. Dithekiso di phahame kamora boitlhahiso ba hae ka 2013 lenaneong la Shark Tank..."" This indicates that his appearance on Shark Tank and the subsequent increased sales were the catalyst for him to pursue his business more seriously. While he later found success with QVC and ADT, the initial surge was after Shark Tank.
"
Karolo ka nngwe ya Reading Rainbow e fa bana dikgothalletso tsa eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Dibuka**.

The passage states: ""Karolo kanngwe ya lenaneo e lebisa tlhokomelo ho sehlooho se bukeng e itseng mme ho atoloswe sehloooho seo ka dipale tse ngata."" and ""Reading Rainbow e rutile bana hore hobaneng ba lokela ho bala,… lerato la ho bala — [lenaneo] le kgothalleditse bana ho nka buka mme ba bale.""  This clearly indicates the show encouraged reading books.
"
E ka nna ya ba ke eng e bakileng ho hlakolwa ha letoto la Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **A: Tjhelete e sa lekaneng**.

The text explicitly states: ""ka bobedi ba fanang ka ditjhelete le ho fetoha ha filosofi ya mananeo a thelevishene a rutang ho tlatseditse ho fedisweng ha lenaneo."" This translates to ""both the funding shortage and the change in the philosophy of children's educational television filled the end of the program."" While John Grant's opinion is mentioned, the primary reason given is the lack of funding. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Ke efe ho tse latelang e sa kang ya etswa khang ke ba boholong bakeng sa Amsterdam le musiamo mabapi le sefate?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha ho pelaelo hore se tla wa (There was no expectation that it would fall)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the authorities *believed* the meteorite posed a risk and planned to secure it. They also stated it was a rare type.  It explicitly says they *did* secure it after a ceremony. Therefore, the idea that they had *no expectation* it would fall is contradictory to the information given. The other options align with the passage:

*   **B: Se lokela ho bolokwa (It should have been secured)** - The passage says they planned to secure it.
*   **C: Se silafaditsoe ke hlobo (It was identified as rare)** - This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **D: Se kotsi ho bophelo bo botle ba setjhaba (It posed a risk to public safety)** - This is also directly stated in the passage.



"
"Ho ya ka mohlahlobi ya ka sehloohong wa RSPCA, tlhahlobo e lokela ho ba e tlwaelehileng bakeng sa efe ho tse latelang?","The correct answer is **B: Mang kapa mang ya sebetsang le diphoofolo**.

Here's why:

The quote states: """"CCTV e tla feela e romele letshwao le matla ho batho ba sebetsang ka diphoofolo..."""" This directly indicates that the inspections and CCTV implementation are intended for those who work with animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dikhamera tsa CCTV:** While CCTV is the *tool* being implemented, the inspections aren't *of* the cameras themselves.
*   **C: Disebedidiswa tsa ho beha leihlo:** While CCTV is a surveillance method, the focus isn't on the surveillance methods themselves, but who is working with the animals.
*   **D: Dibaka tsa ho hlaba diphoofolo:** The quote doesn't specifically mention slaughterhouses. While animal welfare is a concern in slaughterhouses, the statement is broader.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang, ke thuto efe e kenyeletswang boithutong ba porofeshenale?","The correct answer is **A: Thuso aa pele (First aid)**.

The passage states: ""Thuto ka ho tlwaelehileng e tla kopanyeletsa ditaba tsohle tse boletsweng mona ka botlalo, hangata ka ho etsa dintho ka sebele. Thuto ka ho tlwaelehileng e tla ba matsatsi a 2-5 mme e tla akarelletsa ho nka karolo, **thuso ya pele e ngata** mme nako e nngwe kwetliso ya dibetsa.""

This indicates that first aid is a typical component of a wilderness training course. While the other options are related to wilderness survival, the passage specifically mentions ""thuso ya pele"" (first aid) as a common element."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke mokhwa ofe wa mantlha o ka o thusang ho qoba metsi a kanna ya ba a ditshila?","The correct answer is **D: Lekola metsi bakeng sa kotsi e ka bang teng**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of checking water for potential contaminants, especially given the various purification methods and the potential risks associated with contaminated water. While boiling and using filters are mentioned, the core advice is to *check* the water first.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Bedisa metsi metsotso e itseng (Boil water for a certain amount of time):** This is a method of purification, but the passage focuses more on the initial assessment.
*   **B: Reka metsi a dibotlolong (Buy bottled water):** This is a solution, but not a method for preventing contaminated water.
*   **C: Bedisa metsi motsotso (Boil water for a short time):** Similar to A, it's a purification method, but not the primary advice highlighted in the text.

Therefore, **checking the water for potential dangers** is the most fundamental step to prevent drinking contaminated water, aligning best with the overall message of the passage."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke eng e batlang e ke ke ya kgoneha le ho disesi tse nang le boiphihlelo?","The correct answer is **C: Ho sesa kgahlanong le sefutho sa metsi (Sesa against the water current)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Batho ba bangata ba shwa ka lebaka la ho kgathala ba leka ho sesa kgahlanong le phallo, ho ka bang boima ho ho etsa."" (Many people drown because they try to swim against the current, it can be difficult to do.)

The question asks what cannot be done by people with feelings, according to the text. The passage directly mentions the difficulty of swimming against the current. Therefore, it implies that people with feelings (i.e., those struggling) will have difficulty swimming against the current.
"
Ke eng seo o lokelang ho se etsa ha o khangwa ke sefutho sa metsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Leka ho tswa ka ho ya sebakeng se seng, ebe o sesa o kgutlela lebopong ka tlwaelo** (Try to move to another place and then swim back to the surface normally).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how a cramp in the leg can occur while swimming.** It emphasizes the importance of staying calm and trying to get to safety.
* **Option A aligns with the advice given in the passage.** It suggests a controlled exit and a normal swimming motion back to the surface.
* **Option B (Sesa kapele kgahlanong le metsi - Swim hard against the water) is incorrect.** This would likely worsen the cramp and exhaust the swimmer.
* **Option C (Sesa ka nqa e fapaneng - Swim with a different stroke) is incorrect.** This is unlikely to help and could be dangerous.
* **Option D (Sesa ka tlasa metsi - Swim underwater) is incorrect.**  This is extremely dangerous and should be avoided.



Therefore, option A is the safest and most appropriate response according to the provided text."
"Ho latela seratswana, ke sebakeng sefe moo ho ka tjhakelwang qhobosheaneng se ka etsang hore e ba leeto la bohlokwa la matsatsi a phomolo?","The correct answer is **C: Phuleng ya Rhine**.

The question asks where you can go wine tasting for a memorable trip, and the text specifically mentions the Loire Valley (a region known for its wines) and the Rhine Valley as examples. Therefore, the Rhine Valley is a good fit.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, ho tse latelang ke keletso efe e sa kgothaletsweng basadi ba etelang sebaka seo?","The correct answer is **A: Tlohela ho bua ka ditaba tsa boemo ba lenyalo (Avoid talking about your marital status)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly warns women to avoid discussing their marital status. It states that in the Sahel region, women who travel and mention they are unmarried may be targeted, regardless of their marital status.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hlokomela hore ho setshwane hwa setso ho ka baka batho ba lehae ba ntshe maikutlo ka mokwa o hlohleletsang (Be aware that cultural norms can cause locals to react in a disturbing way):** This is actually *encouraged* by the text. It advises women to be aware of potential cultural sensitivities and how they could be misinterpreted.
* **C: Qoba ho rwala mabenyane a turu (Avoid wearing flashy jewelry):** This is also *encouraged* by the text. It advises against wearing things that might be perceived as provocative or attract unwanted attention.
* **D: Bua ka thata ha ho hlokahala (Speak firmly when necessary):** This is *encouraged* by the text. It advises women to be assertive and stand their ground if they encounter unwanted attention.



Therefore, the only advice the text *discourages* is discussing one's marital status.



"
"Re ipapisitse le tlhaloso ya sebaka seratswaneng, ke eng e ka bang keletso e thusang baeti ba basadi?","The best answer is **A: Elellwa hore ha hwa tlwaleha ho salwa morao.**

Here's why:

*   The provided text heavily emphasizes the danger of being taken advantage of and the importance of not being left alone. It explicitly states ""Ho kgothalletswa hore basadi le ha e le bafe ba nkang leeto ba bolele hore ba nyetswe, ho sa tsotellehe boemo ba bona ba lenyalo. Hoa thusa hape ho rwala reng (empa e sa shebahaleng e bitsa haholo)."" This directly relates to the risk of being taken advantage of.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Rwala reng e kgolo ho bontsha hore o nyetswe** While the text mentions ""rwala reng,"" it frames it as something ""sa shebahaleng e bitsa haholo"" (not highly recommended) and doesn't make it the primary advice.
*   **C: Utlwisisa hore ho fapana hwa setso ho etsa hore o qobe ho ikemela** The text states that cultural differences can cause problems but that it's not an excuse for bad behavior.  This isn't the most crucial piece of advice for a female traveler.
*   **D: Moo o sa batleng, tiisa ho hana banna** While standing firm and refusing unwanted advances is important, the core message is about avoiding potentially dangerous situations in the first place, which is more directly addressed in option A.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the provided text.



"
"Ho latela seratswana, ke maemo afe ao ho ka hlokahalang hore motho ya nkang diphoofolo tse hlaha difoto a sebedise dilense tse kgethehileng?","The correct answer is **C: Haeba diphoofolo tse nkwang difoto di le dihlong.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ho boima ho fumana diphoofolo tse ngata tsa mafatsheng a mang, mme dirapa ka dinako tse ding di na le melao e mabapi le ho nka dinepe ka morero wa ho etsa kgwebo ka tsona. Diphoofolo tsa naha di ka ba le dihlong kapa leqhoko.""

This directly links the presence of horns or tusks on the animal to a potential need for specialized lenses.  Horns and tusks can obstruct the view, requiring a lens that compensates for that obstruction to get a clear photo.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Haeba o nka foto ya phoofolo tse nyane:** While small animals might require different lenses than large ones, the passage doesn't explicitly connect small size to *specialized* lenses.
* **B: Haeba difoto tseo di tlo rekiswa:**  The passage mentions commercial hunting regulations, but not that selling photos *requires* specialized lenses.
* **D: Haeba sebaka seo se na le melao e kgethehileng mabapi le ho nka diphoofolo tse hlaha difoto:**  Regulations might require certain permits or practices, but they don't automatically necessitate specific lenses.



"
Ke eng e sa bolelwang seratswaneng eo e leng phephetso ho batho ba nkang difoto?,"The correct answer is **B: Ho sebetsana le diphoofolo tse mabifi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Diphoofolo tsa naha di ka ba le dihlong kapa leqhoko."" (Wild animals can have claws or horns). This means one of the unexpected aspects of photographing them is dealing with the potential danger of potentially dangerous animals.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ho fumana diphoofolo tse sa tlwaelehang (Finding unusual animals):** While finding unique animals *can* be a goal, the passage doesn't highlight this as an unexpected difficulty.
* **C: Ho fumana mefuta ea dilense tse hlokwang (Finding the right types of lenses):** The passage mentions the need for long lenses, but doesn't characterize this as an unexpected difficulty in itself.
* **D: Ho sebetsa dibakeng tse ka bang le bora (Working in potentially rough locations):** The passage mentions that the environment can be harsh, but not necessarily ""rough"" in a way that's unexpected regarding the animals themselves.



"
"Ho tse latelang, ke eng e ka bakang mathata a fokolang ho bakganni ba kgannang tseleng tse dithabeng?","The correct answer is **C: Mouwane wa metsi o fetoha mokedikedi o mongata (Water film turns into a thin layer)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ho bonahala ho ka thibelwa ke lehlwa le wang kapa le fokang kapa ke mouwane kapa leqhwa difensetereng tsa koloi."" (It seems it can be prevented by a film that is worn or faded, or by water or dirt on the car windows.)
* **Option C directly addresses this prevention:** A thin water film is less likely to cause problems for cyclists than a thick layer of dirt or grime.  A thin layer can be cleared easily.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Sephethephethe se seholo (Large hail):** The passage specifically mentions hail as a *potential* hazard, not a solution to a problem.
* **B: Kgohlano e tlaase (Low angle):**  The angle of the sun doesn't inherently create problems for cyclists (though it can affect visibility, which the passage addresses with dirt/water).
* **D: Ponahalo e fokotsehileng (Reduced appearance):** This is too vague. The passage talks about visibility being reduced by dirt or water.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer because it points to a condition that, according to the passage, can be prevented and thus lessen difficulties for cyclists.



"
Ke eng e ka dulang e tsitsitse ka lekeno la lekgetho dinaheng tse fapaneng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditefiso (Fees)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the **costs** of work permits (lekgetho la basebetsi) vary greatly from country to country.  This directly relates to the fees associated with the permit.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Sebopeho (Structure/Format):** While the *structure* of work permits can differ, the passage doesn't focus on that. It highlights the *financial* differences.
* **C: Moo o bolokang difaele (Where you store files):** This is irrelevant to work permits.
* **D: Masakana (Requirements):** The passage mentions differences in requirements but specifically emphasizes the cost variations.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **Ditefiso (Fees)**.
"
"Ho latela seratswana, haeba o sebetsa mose ho mawatle empa o dula sebakeng se seng o tla be o ntse o tlatsa lekgetho kae?","The correct answer is **C: Naheng eo o sebetsang ho yona**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ntle le ha o le moemedi wa dinaha, ho sebetsa mose ho mawatle ka kakaretso ho bolela hore o tla lokela ho ngodisetsa lekgetho la basebedtsi **naheng eo o dulang ho yona**."" (Except if you are a resident of a country, working abroad generally means you need to register with the resident's workers' insurance in **the country where you are staying**.)
"
Ke polelo efe ho tse latelang e sa hlaloseng ka nepo Dipontsho tsa Lefatshe?,"The correct answer is **D: Dinaha ha di tlamehe ho nka karolo** (Countries do not have to participate).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Dinaha tse nkang karolo di bontsha dintho tsa boqapi le tsa thuto..."" (Countries participating show architectural and educational things...). This implies that participation is *required*, not optional.
* **Options A, B, and C** are all directly supported by the text:
    * **A:** ""...histori ya naha"" (history of the country)
    * **B:** ""...dipontsho tsa dipalesa, dirapa le ntho le ha e le efe e tsamaisanang le dimela"" (...flower shows, gardens, and anything related to plants)
    * **C:** ""nka nako e tlohang ho dikgwedi tse tharo ho ya ho tse tsheletseng"" (can take a full three to six months)



Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the text is D.
"
Ke eng ho tse latelang e leng molao wa dipontsho tsa lefatshe kapa dipontsho tsa matjhaba?,"The correct answer is **B: Naha e tshwanang e ke ke ya tshwara diketsahalo tsena selemo le selemo.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Le hoja ha ho bolelwa di ka etsahala ka selemo (hafeela di le dibakeng tse fapa-fapaneng), ka sebele ha ho jwalo.""  This means World Expos don't happen every year.

Let's look at why the other options are not as accurate:

* **A: Dipontsho di lokela ho bontsha nalane ya naha le ditaba tsa lefatshe:** While the text mentions countries showcasing culture, issues, and history, it doesn't *require* them to specifically present national history and global affairs.
* **C: Diketsahalo di tlameha ho nka dikgweli tse tsheletseng:** The text says Expos typically last three to six months, but doesn't *require* them to be that long.
* **D: Hore dipontsho di tshwarwe, dinaha di tlameha ho nka karolo:**  The text doesn't state that countries are *required* to participate simply because an Expo is held.

Therefore, option B is the most directly supported by the provided text."
Ho ka etswang ho tse latelang e ka fokotsang menyetla ya hore diphoofolo li hlasele?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho ba hole le diphiri bohato ba maoto a 25**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ho ya ka balaodi ba serapa, dula bonnyane di-yard/mithara tse 100 hole le dibere le diphiri le di-yard/mithara tse 25 ho diphoofolo tsohle tsa naha."" This means maintaining a distance of 25 yards (approximately 23 meters) from bushes and wildlife is a key safety precaution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ho jara ditlama tse monko o monate** - This is not mentioned in the passage and is not a primary safety measure.
*   **B: Ho tlosa dithole kampong** - While removing food attractants is helpful, the passage prioritizes maintaining distance from wildlife.
*   **D: Ho thibela diphoofolo ka makumane a dijo** -  This is related to option B (removing food attractants) and not as important as the distance requirement mentioned in the passage.



"
Ke eng ho tse latelang e sa bolelwang seratswaneng e ka bakang sesosa sa ho hlaselwa ke diphoofolo tse hlaha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho fepa diphoofolo tse hlaha**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""...ha dia tshwanela ho fepuwa kapa di sitiswe."" This means *not* trying to feed the baboons is important for safety. Feeding them makes them associate humans with food and increases the likelihood of them approaching and potentially attacking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Menko e bohale:** The text doesn't mention anything about noisy behavior attracting baboons.
* **B: Ho hlolwa ho ba hole le tsona haholo:** The text states staying 100 yards from baboons and 25 yards from other animals, so being distant is advised.
* **D: Diphoofolo tse sa tlwaelang batho:** The text says baboons *don't* usually fear humans, which is part of the problem.

Therefore, the only option that directly contradicts the safety advice given in the text is feeding the baboons."
