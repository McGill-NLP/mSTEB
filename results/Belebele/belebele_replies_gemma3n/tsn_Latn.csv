"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se o ka reng ga se kakantsho e ntle ka go tshameka korosetina?","The correct answer is **B: O se ka wa tshikinyega mo go sa tlhokegeng go boloka maatla a gago.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Gape o leke go re o seka wa dira motshikinyego o o kgethegileng ka menwana ya ga go."" (Also, try not to exert yourself excessively.) This directly supports option B.
* **Option A** contradicts the text, which says you don't need to press buttons hard.
* **Option C** is irrelevant to the text. The text doesn't mention sitting position.
* **Option D** describes a method of creating a quiet sound, which isn't the focus of the text. The text is about preventing unnecessary exertion.



Therefore, option B is the only option that reflects the information presented in the text."
"Fa o tshameka korosetina, ke eng mo go tse di latelang, e e tla thusang go oketsa modumo?","The correct answer is **C: Go se tobetse ka maatla.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Gakologelwa gore ga go tlhokege go tobetsa dikonopo ka maatla a magolo gore go utlwale modumo o mogolwane jaaka mo pianong."" (It should be noted that you don't need to press the buttons with great force to hear a loud sound like on a piano.)
* **The passage also says:** ""Fa o bona modumo o mogolwane, o dirisa kgatelelo kgotsa lebelo le legolwane mo meubeng."" (If you see a loud sound, you use a hammer or a large nail on furniture.) This implies a delicate touch is needed.

Therefore, pressing buttons *with force* (option B) is the *opposite* of what the passage recommends.  Options A and D are irrelevant to the situation described.
"
Ke ka ntlha ya eng ditshwantsho tse di mo thelebisheneng di segilwe melelwane?,"The correct answer is **B: Gore setshwantsho se khurumetse sekirini sotlhe.**

Here's why:

The passage explains that ""go tshwantsha phetelela"" (letterboxing) is used to ensure the picture fills the entire screen.  Sometimes, the aspect ratio of a video doesn't match the aspect ratio of the TV screen. To avoid distortion, black bars (letterbox) are added to the top and bottom of the image.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go letlelela tlhaloso ya se se buiwang:** This is too general. While the passage *explains* letterboxing, it's not the *reason* the pictures are letterboxed.
* **C: Go letlelela phetogo e e motlhofo gore e nne ka tsela e nngwe:** This refers to aspect ratio changes, not letterboxing.
* **D: Go ntsha mafoko a a tlhalosang gore a se ka a nna gaufi thata mo tlase:** While there *are* text descriptions sometimes placed at the bottom, they aren't the primary *reason* for letterboxing. The core reason is to fill the screen properly.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke mathata afe a a latelang, a motho a ka kopanang le one fa a fetolela filimi kwa sebopegong sa DVD?","The correct answer is **A: Setshwantsho se se sa khurumetseng sekirini sotlhe.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the problem with DVD film conversion is that ""dithelebishene di le dintsi di dirilwe ka tsela e e tla itumedisang batho ka kakaretso...ka ntlha ya seo, sengwe le sengwe se o se bonang mo thelebisheneng se ile sa segwa melelwane, kwa godimo, kwa tlase le kwa thoko."" This means the picture isn't perfectly aligned across the entire screen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mafoko a a tlhalosang a ntshitswe go se kae:** The passage mentions text appearing at the bottom of the screen, but it doesn't say it's *missing*. It just says it might be blurry or difficult to read.
*   **C: Setshwantsho se se khurumetsang sekirini sotlhe:** This is the opposite of the problem described.
*   **D: setšhaba sa Mokgatšha wa Indus:** This is completely unrelated to the topic of DVD conversion.



"
Masole a Borithane a ne a le mo lefelong lefe?,"The correct answer is **B: Trenton**.

The passage states: ""Mogenerale James Ewing o ne a tla ralala noka kwa **Trenton Ferry**..."" This indicates that American soldiers were stationed at Trenton.
"
Ke mosaeno wa ga mang o o tlhagelelang mo tlhomong ya mokwalo?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bosigo jotlhe go ne ga gatisiwa dikhopi di le 150 go ya go 200, tse ga jaana di itsegeng e le """"Dipampirikgolo tsa ga Dunlap""""."" This means John Dunlap printed the broadside.
"
"Mo mafelong a a latelang, matlhakore a mabedi a Dunlap a gorogile kwa kae la bofelo?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The passage states: ""Kopololo ya sone e ile ya goroga kwa London ka di-10 tsa Phatwe."" which translates to ""Its copy then went to London on October 10th.""
"
Masole a ga Colonel Stark a ne a le kwa kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka fa bokone, go bapisa legora** (On the heights, facing the gorge).

The passage states: ""Banna ba ga Stark ba ne tsaya maemo a bonego bapisa legora..."" which translates to ""Stark's men positioned themselves on the heights, facing the gorge...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mo metsi a felelang teng, fa letshitshing lo lonnye.** (In the available water, where the river was narrow). This describes a location *within* the gorge, not where Stark's men were positioned.
*   **C: Ntlheng ya bokone-botlhaba jwa setlhakatlhake.** (On the northern heights of the gorge). While technically true, the passage specifies they were positioned *facing* the gorge, not just *on* the northern heights.
*   **D: Fa pele ga legora.** (In front of the gorge). This is not the precise location described in the passage. They were on the heights *facing* the gorge.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, banna ba ga Stark ba ne ba oketsa lorako leng?","The correct answer is **B: Go fitlha ba ka metlha ba feta pale**.

The passage states: ""Gridley kana Stark o ne a tlhoma pale sekgala se ka nna dikgato di le 100 (30m) fa pele ga legora a bo a laela go re ope a seka a hula go fitlha ba ka metlha ba e feta pele."" This translates to: ""Gridley or Stark then ordered a line to be made 100 (30m) ahead of the line and told them not to stop until they had passed it.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang, e e neng e le ka nako ya fa China e ne e tletse tshololo ya madi?","The correct answer is **D: Motlha wa Magosi a Mararo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nako e itsegeng thata go gaisa e ne e le ya motlha wa Magosi a a Mararo o o nnile gone ka lobaka lwa dingwaga di le 60 fa gare ga Lolwapa Lwa Segosi lwa Han le Jin. **Mo lobakeng lono lwa nako go nnile le dintwa tsa matlho a mahibidu fa gare ga batlotlegi ba le bantsi ba lwelwa setilo sa bogosi. Magosi a le Mararo e ne e le nngwe ya dipaka tse di tletseng tshololo ya madi thata mo hisitoring ya China wa Bogologolo**...""

The passage directly connects the period of the Sixteen Kingdoms (Motlha wa Magosi a Mararo) with a time of extreme political turmoil and bloodshed. While the other options are related to Chinese history, they aren't as directly linked to the description of a period of extreme political strife and bloodshed as the Sixteen Kingdoms are.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se e leng boammaruri ka setlhopa sa masole a ditshoswane a neng a aga manno a nakwana, a a agiwang sesha letsatsi le letsatsi?","The correct answer is **B: Fa a felelwa ke dijo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Masole a simolola go bothologa fa a felelwa ke dijo."" (The soldiers start to digest when they are fed.) This directly answers the question of what triggers the soldiers to digest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di lala di tsamaya bosigo.** (They sleep and walk around.) - While the passage mentions they sleep and walk around *after* digesting, it doesn't state that sleeping and walking around is what *starts* the digestion process.
* **C: Megwantlo e e nna e tsaya lebaka la malatsi a tla nna 17.** (The stomach takes the place of 17 days.) - This refers to the duration of digestion, not the trigger for digestion.
* **D: Di bothologa motshegare.** (They digest daily.) - This is too general. The passage says they digest *when they are fed*.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko a fe a a bontshang sentle gore setlhopa sa masole a ditshoswane se aga manno  a nakwana, a a agiwang sesha tsatsi  le letsatsi?","The correct answer is **A: Di aga mesima bosigo**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Masole a aga manno a nakwana, a a agiwang sesha tsatsi le letsatsi."" (The soldiers built a sturdy shelter, which was given to them day by day.)
* **Option A** directly reflects this statement by saying ""Di aga mesima bosigo"" (They built a sturdy shelter/den).
* **Option B** talks about the duration of the shelter, not the building process.
* **Option C** and **Option D** are not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately represents the information given in the passage.
"
Ke eng mo go tse di latelang di tlile go tswelela le fa go na le dilo tse dingwe tse di diregang ko ntle?,"The correct answer is **B: Meribo ya nako le nako (Time and time again)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many things happening in the body and human behavior are influenced by time and change over time. It emphasizes that these changes are often subtle and influenced by various factors like diet, environment, and even slight emotional shifts.  This directly aligns with the concept of things happening ""time and time again"" or repeatedly over time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dilo tse di diragalang mo teng ga tsone (The things that happen there):** This is too general. The passage is about *how* things change over time, not just *what* happens.
*   **C: Dinako tsa tlholego (Times of rest):** While rest is important, the passage isn't primarily focused on periods of rest. It's about continuous change.
*   **D: Meribo e e lebeletsweng (Expected things):**  The passage highlights the unexpected and subtle ways time influences bodily processes, not just what's predictable.



"
Ke lefoko lefe le le tlhalosang mongwe le mongwe yo o bontshang ditshwano tsa mokgwa tse di farologaneng?,"The correct answer is **D: Medumo e e tshwanang**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** means having many different forms or appearances. The question asks for the word that describes individuals showing diverse phenotypic traits.  ""Medumo e e tshwanang"" translates to ""different forms"" or ""varying appearances"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dilo di direga ka tsela e e tshwanang** (Things happen in the same way): This describes a process, not the characteristics of individuals.
* **B: Ditshedi** (Species): This refers to a broader classification of organisms, not individual variation within a population.
* **C: Ditshedi** (Species) -  This is a duplicate of option B.



"
Ke mafoko afe a a tshwanang a detshedi tse di dulang mo lefelong le le rileng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ditshedi**

Here's why:

The passage discusses how different individuals within a population can have similar (monomorphic) or different (polymorphic) physical characteristics (ditshedi). The question asks what word is the same for the individuals in a population that live in the same habitat.  The passage explicitly states that if all individuals in a population have similar physical traits, they are called ""monomorphic,"" and if they have different traits, they are ""polymorphic."" Thus, the individuals are referred to as ""ditshedi"" (which translates to ""individuals"" or ""organisms"") in both scenarios.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dilo di direga ka tsela e e tshwanang (Things happen in the same way):** This is too general and doesn't directly relate to the physical characteristics of the individuals.
*   **B: Palo ya batho (Number of people):**  While the number of individuals in a population can be a factor, the passage focuses on their physical characteristics, not their quantity.
*   **D: Medumo e e tshwanang (Similar fame):** This is completely irrelevant to the context of the passage, which is about biological variation."
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang o kare ga e se sekai sa tiro ya tlhago ya bojanala?,"The correct answer is **B: Go tsaya ditshwantsho tsa malomo a naga (Photographing wildlife)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes wildlife tourism as focusing on experiencing nature and its animals. While all the options *could* be part of a wildlife experience, the passage specifically mentions activities like ""go tsoma ditlhapi"" (tracking animals), ""go tsaya dinepe"" (observing animals), ""go leba dinonyane"" (watching birds), and ""go eta"" (visiting parks).  Photographing wildlife fits perfectly within this category of observation and appreciation.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct matches:

* **A: Go tsamaya go ya ko diphororong tsa metsi (Going on boat trips):** Boat trips *can* be part of wildlife tourism (e.g., river cruises to see animals), but it's not the core focus described.
* **C: Go etela diparaka (Visiting parks):** This is a general activity, and while parks are mentioned, it's a broader category than the specific experiences detailed.
* **D: Go tshwara tlhapi (Tracking animals):** This is explicitly mentioned as an activity within wildlife tourism.



Therefore, **B** is the best fit as it represents a key activity within the described wildlife tourism experiences.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e leng motheo wa tsamaiso ya dipalangwa?","The correct answer is **B: Dikoloi tsa beng (People's cars)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights that the core of the transportation system is people using their own cars to travel to work and events. The fact that they rely on their cars and can find help from others using their cars is presented as central to the described situation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Lefelo la tiro (Workplace location):** While workplace location is a factor influencing travel, it's not the *core* of the transportation system itself.
* **C: Lefatshe le le ikemetseng (Independent Earth):** This is a broad statement about the Earth's capacity to support life, not specific to transportation.
* **D: Go iphetogela ga batho (Human evolution):** Human evolution is a historical process and not directly related to the mechanics or structure of the current transportation system described in the passage.

Therefore, the passage emphasizes the role of individual cars in the transportation system, making ""Dikoloi tsa beng"" the most accurate answer."
Dilwana tse di dikologileng nutlease di na le mofuta ofe wa maatla?,"The correct answer is **D: Di tlhatlhetswe booketsego le bofokotsego (Both repulsive and attractive)**.

Here's why:

* **Protons:** Protons have a positive electric charge. Like charges repel each other. This creates a repulsive force between protons within the nucleus.
* **Neutrons:** Neutrons have no electric charge.
* **Electrons:** Electrons have a negative electric charge.  Opposite charges attract each other. Electrons are attracted to the positive charge of the protons in the nucleus.

Therefore, the forces within the nucleus are a combination of both repulsive forces (between protons) and attractive forces (between neutrons and protons, and between electrons and protons - although the electron's attraction is outside the nucleus).
"
Nutlease e nale dilwana dife?,"The correct answer is **B: Di-neutron le proton**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Togwa e na le dikarolo di le pedi - di-neutron le di-proton."" (An atom has two parts - neutrons and protons.)
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e leng sekai sa nomore e e nang le dinomore tse pedi tse tlhano?","The correct answer is **D: 110101**

Here's why:

* **Binary Number System:** The question states that computers use a binary number system, which only uses the digits 0 and 1.
* **Binary Numbers with Five Digits:** We need to find the option that consists of five digits, each of which is either 0 or 1.

Let's examine the options:

* **A: 1010** - Has only 4 digits.
* **B: 12001** - Contains the digit 2, which is not a binary digit.
* **C: 10010** - Has only 5 digits, all of which are binary digits.
* **D: 110101** - Has 6 digits, all of which are binary digits.

Therefore, option **D** is the only one that fits the description of a five-digit binary number.
"
Dinomore tse di nang le dinomore tse pedi di bidiwa eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Manathwana**.

Here's why:

* **Manathwana (bits)** are the fundamental units of information in computing. They represent the two possible states (0 or 1).
* **Boleng (quantity/amount)** is not related to the basic units of digital information.
* **Puo e e faphegileng (different language)** refers to programming languages, not the numerical representation of data.
* **Dipopego (visions/ideas)** is irrelevant to the concept of binary numbers.

Therefore, the question asks for the name of numbers with only two possible values (0 and 1), which are called bits or manathwana.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tse go sa buiwang ka tsone mo serapeng jaaka e le tse di solegelang molemo moithuti yo o nang le taeari ya inthanete?,"The correct answer is **D: Koketsego ya keletso ya go batla go tswelapele go ithuta**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the benefits of blogging for students in terms of:

* **Developing writing skills:**  ""Go kwala go dira gore baithuti ba nne botlhale ba itse se diragalang mo lefatseng le le ba dikologileng."" (Writing makes students knowledgeable about what's happening in the world.)
* **Promoting collaboration:** ""Go kwala ka sengwe go tiisa tirisano-mmogo..."" (Writing together strengthens collaboration.)
* **Encouraging deeper learning:**  ""...le go kgothatsa bana ba sekolo go oketsa go ithuta thata..."" (...and encourages students to learn harder...)
* **Building confidence and a sense of belonging:** ""Go kwala ka sengwe go tiisa tirisano-mmogo, le go kgothatsa bana ba sekolo go oketsa go ithuta thata go fetisa jaaka go tlwaelesegile ka letsatsi la thuto.  Tiso e e siameng ya di-blog ""e kgona go fa baithuti bokgoni jwa go lebelela ko teng le go nna tlhaga..."" (Writing blogging offers students the ability to look around and be heard.)

While the passage touches on students becoming ""heard"" and developing skills, it *doesn't* explicitly mention the increased encouragement to continue learning or a desire for more knowledge.  Option D is the option that best represents this implied benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tokafatso ya bokgoni jwa thutapuo le go kwala:** The passage *does* discuss this extensively.
* **B: Phokotsego ya go tshwaiwa phoso ke dithaka:** The passage doesn't mention anything about avoiding criticism or making mistakes.
* **C: Go lemoga thata ka se se diregang mo tikologong:** While mentioned, the emphasis isn't on simply *noticing* the challenges, but on actively engaging with and understanding the world through writing.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tsa dikarolo tsa go dira taeari mo ithaneteng e e bontshiwang e tlhotlheletsa moithuti go tokafatsa bokgoni jwa bone jwa go kwala?,"The correct answer is **D: Go batla go dirisana (To communicate)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that blogging fosters collaboration and allows students to share their perspectives. It states: ""Go kwala ka sengwe go tiisa tirisano-mmogo, le go kgothatsa bana ba sekolo go oketsa go ithuta thata go fetisa jaaka go tlwaelesegile ka letsatsi la thuto"" (Writing about something else ensures togetherness, and encourages school children to improve their hard work than usual on a school day).

Furthermore, it highlights that blogging provides students with the ability to ""nna tlhaga mo go arabeng ditirelo tsa mo inthaneteng"" (be a voice in the online world).  Being a voice and sharing information is fundamentally about communication. Option D, ""Go batla go dirisana,"" directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go araba dilo tse di mo inthaneteng ganngwe le gape (To divide online things into others):** While organization might be helpful, the passage doesn't prioritize this as a key aspect of developing writing skills.
* **B: Go batla go itlhokomolosa go tshwaya diphoso (To want to forgive mistakes):**  While resilience is good, the passage focuses on the positive aspects of blogging, not specifically on forgiving mistakes.
* **C: Go baya leitlho kgatlhego ya babadi (To put a bad attitude):** The passage is completely opposite of this. It promotes a positive and collaborative environment.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **D: Go batla go dirisana**.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tse di sa tsweleng mosola tsa puisano e e sa diregeng ka nako e e tshwanang ya baithuti? ,"The correct answer is **B: Go bua le molaedi ba lebane mo matlhong ka nako nngwe le nngwe ya letsatsi.**

Here's why:

The passage states that effective communication helps students manage their study schedule and avoid procrastination. Option B, ""Go bua le molaedi ba lebane mo matlhong ka nako nngwe le nngwe ya letsatsi"" (Talking to friends at any time of the day), directly contradicts the idea of managing time and avoiding distractions.  Constantly talking to friends would be a major source of distraction and would hinder a student's ability to study effectively.

Here's why the other options are *not* the best fit:

* **A: Go dirisa inthanete jaaka motswedi** (Using the internet as a tool): The passage actually *encourages* using the internet for research. It's presented as a benefit.
* **C: Go fetofetoga ga diura tsa go dira** (Changing study hours):  The passage mentions that flexibility in study time is a feature of time management, not something inherently wrong.
* **D: Go laola lobelo** (Managing schedule):  The passage explicitly states that time management is about managing schedules, so this is a key component of effective communication/study habits.



Therefore, option B is the only one that directly presents a behavior that would impede the effective communication and time management described in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tsa puisano e e sa diregeng ka nako e e tshwanang, e e sa fetogeng go rekegela baithuti?","The correct answer is **D: Tiriso ya inthanete**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights how the internet and the World Wide Web *change* the way students access information and communicate with teachers.  It specifically mentions the ability to find information at any time and ask questions at any moment.  This is a direct contrast to the other options:

* **A: Lobelo lwa go ithuta (Learning styles):**  While learning styles might be addressed in teaching, the passage doesn't indicate a change in them.
* **B: Diura tsa tiro (Work schedules):**  Work schedules are outside the scope of the passage regarding communication and learning.
* **C: Dibuka tsa ditaelo (Instructional manuals):** While manuals might be available online now, the passage emphasizes the broader shift caused by the internet and WWW, not just access to manuals.

Therefore, the internet's impact is the only one explicitly presented as a *change* in the context of communication and learning discussed in the passage.



"
"Ga go a umakiwa eng mo temaneng e, se motho a ka se golaganyang le dikago tsa bogologolo?","The correct answer is **D: Batlhabani (Pests)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the common plagues of the harvest cause ""disasters, hunger, large markets and the hardship of Arthur's people."" It also mentions hearing ""the rustling and chirping of insects in the fields and being tormented by the fluttering of moths.""

Therefore, the plagues are specifically described as pests (batlhabani). The other options, while potentially related to hardship, aren't the primary focus of the passage as the *cause* of the plagues.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang mo serapeng jaaka monkgo kgotsa modumo o o kgonang go diriwa jaaka kgakgamatso mo matlotleng a dikago tsa bogologolo?,"Letshwao le tlhako.

**Explanation:**

The passage discusses the common folklore surrounding the legend of Arthur and the Holy Grail. It mentions the quest, the trials, and the supposed supernatural elements.  The question asks what *isn't* typically found in the legend that could be used as a metaphor.

* **Dintwa (Animals):** Animals often feature in folklore and can represent different qualities or challenges. They are a common metaphorical element.
* **Letshogo (Gold):** Gold is a classic symbol of wealth, value, and often, spiritual purity.  It's frequently used metaphorically.
* **Mediro (Miracles):** Miracles are inherently symbolic of divine intervention, hope, and overcoming impossible odds.  They are often used to represent inner transformation.
* **Tlhako (Blood):** Blood is a powerful symbol of sacrifice, life, and often, a connection to the past or spiritual realm. It is a very common and potent metaphor.

Therefore, **Letshogo (Gold) and Tlhako (Blood)** are the least likely to be used as a metaphor in the Arthurian legend, as they are quite literally part of the physical objects being sought.  The others (animals, miracles) are much more readily used metaphorically to represent deeper meanings.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e tlhalosang sentle Kago ya bogologolo ya ga Kirby Muxloe?,"The best answer is **A: Mabota a a makima a kago ya bogologolo a kopilwe ke Lord Hastings.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Difenstere tsa yone tse di tona le mabota a a masesanyane..."" which translates to ""Its tall windows and small loopholes..."" This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Go ne go tlhokega kago ya phemelo e nnye ka ntlha ya tlhago e e kagiso ya naga eo ka nako ya fa e ne e agiwa:** The passage says there were *three* loopholes, not just one.
* **C: Kago ya bogologolo e ne e se e e sa tlwaelegang ka nako eo:** The passage says it *was* unusual for its time, but option A is a more specific and directly supported detail.
* **D: E ne ya agiwa gore e kgone go dira fa go ne go lwewa dintwa tse di tsayang sebaka le tse di ikemiseditseng:** The passage mentions defense against raiding parties and horses, but doesn't detail it was specifically built for fighting entrenched troops.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and directly supported answer from the passage.
"
Ke efe ya dikarolo tsa kago tse di latelang di neng di tsewa e le tse di sa tlwaelegang mo go Kagong ya bogologolo ya ga Kirby Muxloe ka nako e e tlhalosiwang mo serapeng?,"The correct answer is **D: Mabota a masesane**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Difenstere tsa yone tse di tona le mabota a a masesanyane, ne di ka seke tsa kgona go emelela tlhaselo e e mashetla lebaka le le leele."" (Its tall windows and small arrow slits could not have withstood a siege due to the narrowness of the walls.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Difensetere tse dikgolo (Tall windows):** The passage actually highlights the *lack* of strong windows as a weakness.
* **B: Motheo o o agailweng gore e kgone go dirisiwa fa go le ko ntweng (A built-in core for use in the middle):** The passage doesn't mention a built-in core.
* **C: Go ne go se na kago ya phemelo mo dikagong tse dingwe tsa bogologolo (There was no fortified manor in other grand manors):** The passage implies that fortified manors *did* exist, and Kirby Muxloe was one of them.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e ne e se mosola fa motabogi a ne a ipaakanyetsa paka e e tlang?","The correct answer is **D: Go dirisa lefelo la go ikatisa mmele o o ko godimo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bangwe ba ralala naga ba taboga ka paka ya mariga, go patagane le go itshidila mmele mo go berekanang le karolo e e kwa godimo ya mmele, go leng ipaakanyo e e siameng go gaisa ya setlha sa metabogo.""

This translates to: ""Some people in the wilderness pray by using a tripod, leaning and stretching their bodies against the upper part of their body, which is a normal posture compared to that of a sitting human.""

Option D directly reflects this description of using a position with the body leaning against the upper part of the body. The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e botlhokwa thata mo phaposing ya ntlha mo motaboging yo o sa tabogeng sekgala se se leele thata?","The correct answer is **A: Go ikatisetsa motabogo wa naga ka paka ya mariga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bangwe ba ralala naga ba taboga ka paka ya mariga, go patagane le go itshidila mmele mo go berekanang le karolo e e kwa godimo ya mmele, ya leng ipaakanyo e e siameng go gaisa ya setlha sa metabogo.""  This directly translates to ""Some people who are prone to nightmares cope by lying on their stomach, hugging themselves and resting their body in a position that is opposite to that of a corpse.""  

Therefore, the text highlights lying on the stomach (paka ya mariga) as a coping mechanism for nightmares.  While the other options are related to nightmare coping, the text explicitly mentions the stomach-lying position.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Go lwela go taboga sephatlho sa maele** (Struggling to cope with nightmares): While this might be *a* reality for many, the text isn't emphasizing the struggle itself, but rather *how* some people cope.
* **C: Go kgona go taboga mo tlase ga metsotso e mebedi** (Being able to cope lying on your stomach for two minutes): The text mentions coping *by* lying on your stomach, not necessarily being able to do it for two minutes. The two minutes is just an example of how some people cope.
* **D: Go lwela go taboga ka lebelo ka boitshoko** (Struggling to cope with expectations through self-control):  The text doesn't discuss expectations or self-control as coping mechanisms.

"Go motabogi, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e se kitlang e kgona go fitlhelelwa fela ka go ja dijo tse di nang le dikotla?","The correct answer is **A: Tokafatso ya tiragatso**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Go boloka tekano e e itekanetseng ya maatla, le mekgwa e e berekang ya go nwa metsi, le go tlhaloganya dikarolo tse di farologaneng tsa mekgwa ya go oketsa dikotla go ka thusa batsayakarolo ba metshameko go tokafatsa tiragatso ya bone...""  This directly links consuming foods with potassium to improved performance.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported:

* **B: Boitumelo jo bo oketsegileng (Complete well-being):** While improved performance can contribute to overall well-being, the passage doesn't make a direct claim about potassium leading to complete well-being.
* **C: Tiragatso ya maemo a a ko godimo (Altitude performance):** The passage doesn't mention altitude specifically.
* **D: Boitekanelo jwa ka gale (Peak performance):**  The passage discusses *improved* performance, not specifically *peak* performance.  While improved performance could lead to peak performance, the passage doesn't assert that potassium *guarantees* peak performance.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang jaaka tsela e motabogi yo o monnye a ka bonang boitumelo thata mo motshamekong o a o tshamekang?","The correct answer is **C: Go nwa metsi thata (Drinking too much water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that drinking *too much* water can negatively impact performance. The other options are presented as ways to *improve* performance. 

* **A: Go ikatisa go ja dijo tse di nang le dikotla (Consuming foods with potassium)** is mentioned as helping maintain appropriate muscle strength.
* **B: Go nna ka gale a taboga ka tsela e e kwa godimo (Being well-hydrated)** is mentioned as being important for performance.
* **D: Go nna a nale maatla a itekanyetseng a a siameng (Having adequate and balanced strength)** is directly linked to improving performance and enjoyment.



Therefore, excessive water intake is the only option described as *detrimental* to performance.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke ka ntlha yang motabogi yo o tabogang mo sekgala se se mo magareng a reka sedirisiwa sa tlhwatlhwa e e kwa godimo?","The correct answer is **D: Go nale dipuo tse di sa tlhomamang ka didirisiwa tse e seng tsa tlhwatlhwa e e ko godimo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""go na le dilkgopolo tse e seng boammaruri mabapi le didiriswa tse di mmalwa tse di dirisiwang go ka tsaya karolo."" This translates to ""there are several untrue rumors about accessories that are used to play a role.""

This implies that people might be using *fake* or *unauthentic* accessories to try and make the taboga appear more impressive, even though the passage warns against relying on them.  The taboga itself is genuinely valued, but people might use deceptive accessories.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ke seo ba se batlang (It's what they want):** While people might *want* a flashy taboga, this doesn't explain *why* they'd use fake accessories.
* **B: E bontshitswe e solegela molemo (It's shown to be beneficial):** The passage cautions against relying on accessories, so it doesn't portray them as beneficial.
* **C: E tlile go dira gore ba kgone go taboga (It has come to make them able to taboga):** This is inaccurate.  The passage emphasizes that the taboga is played *without* the need for accessories.



Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the passage is that people are using fake or inappropriate accessories in an attempt to make the taboga appear more impressive.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se batabogi ba ba tabogang sekgala se se mo magareng ba se tlhokang?","The correct answer is **A: Di dirisiwa tse mmalwa**.

The passage states: ""go na le dilkgopolo tse seng boammaruri mabapi le didiriswa tse di mmalwa tse di dirisiwang go ka tsaya karolo."" This translates to ""there are several untrue rumors about the implements used to play a role.""  This implies that only a few implements are actually needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba tshwanetse go nna le kitso ka go taboga:** The passage doesn't mention needing proof or evidence to play.
* **C: Didirisiwa tse mmalwa thata:** The passage only says the rumors about the implements are untrue, not that they are difficult.
* **D: Madi a mantsi:** The passage doesn't mention money at all.

Ke mang a boneng kgogego ya makenete ya nutlia? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch le Purcell**.

The text states: ""MRI e berekela mo maranyaneng a a bidiwang 'nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)', e e lemogilweng mo dingwageng tsa bo-1930 ke Felix Bloch (wa Stanford University) le Edward Purcell (wa Harvard University).""  This directly indicates that Bloch and Purcell discovered nuclear magnetic resonance.

Ke ka ngwaga o feng go ne gwa newa patente ya ntlha ya kgogedi ya setshwantsho sa kalafi? ,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

The text states: ""Ka ngwaga wa 1977, Dr. Damadian o ile a fetsa go aga sediriswa sa maranyane a """"mmele otlhe"""" sa MRI, se a neng a se bitsa """"Indomitable""""."" This directly indicates that the initial patent for the MRI scanner was obtained in 1977.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se batho ba tshwanetseng go se tlhaloganya gore ba kgone go itse ditiro tsa nama tse di diriwang ke batho ba bangwe?","The correct answer is **A: Maitlhomo (Emotions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that understanding other people's thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and evidence is difficult *without* considering their **emotions**. The example of seeing someone look at a car window and assuming they're going to steal it highlights how our own anxieties can lead us to misinterpret someone's actions.  Therefore, understanding emotions is crucial for accurate interpretation of others' behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Maitlhomo (Beliefs)** - While beliefs influence behavior, the passage suggests emotions are a more fundamental factor in *interpreting* behavior.
* **C: Tumelo (Faith)** - Faith is related to belief, not directly to understanding behavior interpretation.
* **D: Temogo (Language)** - Language is a tool for *expressing* thoughts and feelings, but not the key to *understanding* them.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go tlhaloganaya maitlhomo go thusa batho gore ba dire eng?","The correct answer is **D: Go bala ditlhaloganyo tsa ba bangwe (To read the minds of others)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that understanding others' perspectives, feelings, beliefs, and motivations is difficult and that making assumptions can lead to misinterpretations. Therefore, being able to understand what others are thinking (reading their minds, metaphorically) is crucial for avoiding incorrect assumptions and fostering better understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ntsha maisaitsiweng a a mo morago ga ditiro tsa nama (To make assumptions based on the aftermath of actions):** This is the opposite of what the passage advocates. The passage warns against making assumptions.
*   **B: Go bonela pele dikeletso (To foresee consequences):** While predicting consequences can be helpful, it's not directly related to understanding *why* someone did something.
*   **C: Go leba batho ba bangwe ntle le go ba tlhaola (To look at other people without judging them):**  While non-judgement is important, the passage is more focused on actively *understanding* their thoughts and feelings, not just passively observing.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tlhalosang sentle tshobokanyo ya mosola wa AI?","The correct answer is **D: Go itirela tiro (Problem-solving)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes AI as the ability to create machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  It then lists examples of those tasks, including:

*   **Go dira mechini e e kgonang go itirisa ditiro tse di thlhokanang le tiriso ya botlhale.** (Creating machines that can perform tasks requiring intelligence)
*   **Dikai di akaretsa, go laola, go loga maano, le go beela dinako sentle.** (Involves reasoning, planning, learning from experience, and understanding language)
*   **Bokgoni jwa go araba dipotso tsa bareki, go lemoga mokwalo, lentswe le sefatlhego.** (Ability to answer customer questions, understand writing, language, and tone)
*   **Tsamaiso ya maranyane a Al jaanong a dirisiwa thata mo go tsa itsholelo ya sechaba, kalafi, bo-enjenere le tsa sesole, e ageletswe mo dikhomputareng tsa ko malwapeng le mo metshamekong ya ditshwantso tsa motshikhonyego.** (AI is now widely used in public services, healthcare, engineering, and agriculture, including in embedded computers and virtual reality systems).

All of these points ultimately fall under the umbrella of **problem-solving**. The passage emphasizes AI's ability to tackle complex challenges by using intelligent methods.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Go rulaganya (Planning):** While planning *is* a component of AI, it's not the overarching definition.
*   **B: Go itse ka lentswe (Understanding language):**  This is *one* specific capability of AI, not the defining characteristic.
*   **C: Go dira thulaganyo (Calculating):** While AI can perform calculations, the passage stresses *intelligence* rather than just computation.  It is a much broader concept.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e AI gantsi amangwang le yone?","The correct answer is **A: Tirelo ya badirisi (User service)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dilo tsa go nna jalo di setse e le mefuta e e faraologanyeng ya boitseanape, e e dirisiwang go thusa go rarabolola dikgwetlho dingwe tse di teng mo botshelong. **Tsamaiso ya maranyane a Al jaanong a dirisiwa thata mo go tsa itsholelo ya sechaba, kalafi, bo-enjenere le tsa sesole, e ageletswe mo dikhomputareng tsa ko malwapeng le mo metshamekong ya ditshwantso tsa motshikhonyego.**"" This indicates AI is frequently used for user service in various fields.

While the other options are related to AI, they aren't the *most* frequently mentioned application in the passage.

* **B: Go dira dithulaganyo (Performing calculations)** - This is a fundamental aspect of AI but not the primary focus discussed.
* **C: Tlhamane ya saense (Scientific theory)** - AI is *based* on scientific theories, but the passage emphasizes its practical application.
* **D: Go itsege ga mokwalo (Knowledge of language)** - While AI uses language processing, the passage highlights a wider range of capabilities.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e leng maatla a mongwe yo o kgonang go akanya a tsepamisitse mogopolo?","The answer is **B: O kgona go dirisa ditsela tse disha mo bothateng.**

Here's why:

The passage describes critical thinking as involving analyzing information, considering multiple perspectives, and evaluating evidence.  Option B, ""O kgona go dirisa ditsela tse disha mo bothateng"" (You can use new approaches in a problem), directly reflects this. It implies being flexible and not sticking to one fixed method, which is a key component of critical thinking.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: O kgona go bona dikarabo tse dintsi mo bothateng** (You can see many answers to a problem): While critical thinkers *consider* multiple perspectives, the passage states that critical thinking doesn't limit answers to just ""true"" or ""false."" It's about evaluating those perspectives.
* **C: O tsaya nako go rarabolola mathata** (You spend time solving problems):  While thoughtful problem-solving often takes time, the passage doesn't emphasize time as a defining characteristic of critical thinking.
* **D: O kgona go tshwarelela dipopego ka tlhogo** (You can visualize things in your mind): Visualization can be helpful, but it isn't the core of critical thinking as described in the passage.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e motho yo o kgonang go akanya a tsepamisitse monagano a sa tsepamisang monagano mo go yone?","The correct answer is **A: Go tlhaloganya gore go nale karabo e le nngwe fela e e leng boammaaruri**

Here's why:

The passage describes critical thinking as involving:

*   **Tsepamo ya menagano e ke lebelo:**  Thinking carefully and deliberately.
*   **Mabaka, boikanyego le go lemoga mabaka:** Analyzing reasons, assumptions, and implications.
*   **Go dirisa dithulaganyo tse di setseng di le teng le go batlana le kitso:** Using evidence and seeking facts.
*   **Kgangkgolo ya tlhaloganyo ke: go na le karabo fela e le nngwe e e leng boammaruri:**  This explicitly states that critical thinkers believe there's only one true answer.

Options B, C, and D are all elements of critical thinking, but the passage highlights the belief in a single, true answer as a defining characteristic.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang, e e tsewang e le go ntsha maikutlo a mannye?","The correct answer is **A: Go leba gosele fa a bua (Watching the mouth when someone speaks)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tiriso ya go rekote bidio e ile ya lebisa kwa dithibololong tsa botlhokwa mo tlhalosong ya maikutlo a mannye, metsamao ya sefatlhego tse di tsayang sebaka sa disekonto di le dimilione. Thata thata, go buiwa go re motho o kgona go lemoga go re a motho o bua maaka ka go ela tlhoko ka fa dikarolwana tsa sefatlhego sa gagwe di tsamayang ka teng.""

This directly translates to: ""The fact that video recording led to important discoveries in the understanding of private feelings, facial expressions that occupy millions of seconds. Interestingly, it is said that a person can recognize that someone is speaking with an eye on the movement of the parts of their face.""

Therefore, watching the mouth is the key to understanding facial expressions and, by extension, private feelings. The other options are not mentioned or supported by the passage.
"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang a a tlhalosang go ntsha maikutlo a mannye e seng boammaruri?,"The correct answer is **A: Direkoto tsa bidio di lebisitse kwa dithibololong tsa botlhokwa mo tlhalosong ya maikutlo a mannye.**

Here's why:

The question asks what describes the *recording of emotions that are not genuine*. The text states that video recordings have led to important findings in the understanding of *genuine emotions*.  The implication is that the recordings are revealing what *is* genuine, and by contrast, would help us identify *what is not* genuine.  Option A directly reflects this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tlhaloso e e siameng e ka lemoga maaka:** While true, this focuses on recognizing deception, not the *recording of non-genuine emotions*.
* **C: Puo le tebego ya sefatlhego e ka tlhalosiwa:**  This describes how emotions are expressed, not how they are *recorded* as being inauthentic.
* **D: E ka thusa go lebelela gore a go tswa pelong:** This talks about the origin of emotions (whether from the heart) not the recording of inauthenticity.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate description of how video recordings help us understand and identify non-genuine emotions.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e nnileng ya botlhokwa ka ntlha ya Tsosoloso? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ka fa re anamisang kitso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Totatota, motlha wa tlhabologo o fetotse ka fa re ithutatang ka teng le ka fa re anamisang kitso ka teng."" This translates to: ""Grandfather, the concept of learning has changed in how we learn and how we share knowledge.""  The key here is the sharing/dissemination of knowledge (anamisang kitso).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Go gakologelwa o le esi (Being instructed/Taught):** While instruction is a part of learning, the passage emphasizes the *sharing* of knowledge, not just receiving it.
*   **C: Go gakologelwa molaetsa (Being told a message):**  The passage highlights the *transformation* of learning, not just receiving a message.
*   **D: Go amogela kitso (Receiving knowledge):** Similar to A, receiving knowledge is a component, but the passage is more focused on the *sharing* aspect as a change in the concept of learning.

Therefore, **B** best reflects the core point about the change in learning related to knowledge sharing."
"Ka ntlha ya Tsosoloso, ga go a gatelela efe ya dilo tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **C: Go gakologelwa molaetsa** (Receiving a message).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Totatota, motlha wa tlhabologo o fetotse ka fa re ithutatang ka teng le ka fa re anamisang kitso ka teng. **Go gakologelwa molaetsa e ne ya nna selo sa konokono.**"" This translates to: ""Grandfather, the concept of learning has changed in how we learn and how we share knowledge. **Receiving a message was the essence of wisdom.**""

The question asks what is *not* allowed according to the passage. The passage explicitly says that receiving a message *was* the essence of wisdom (and therefore important). Options A and B are related to receiving a message and gaining wisdom, so they aren't ""not allowed"". Option D is a repeat of option B.

Therefore, the only option that represents something the passage *doesn't* specifically mention as being a core part of wisdom in the context of the changed learning landscape is receiving a message. Because the passage highlights the importance of receiving a message, it implicitly suggests that other aspects of learning have taken precedence.

However, the question asks which of the listed options *ga go a gatelela* (is not allowed). Given the context, the best answer is **C: Go gakologelwa molaetsa** as the text implies a shift away from *solely* receiving a message as the foundation of wisdom.



**Therefore, the most accurate answer is C.**
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa kayeng tlhotlheletso ya go dirisa inthanete go tsweledisa botsalano?,"The correct answer is **A: Go itsalanya ka tsa kgwebo (Shopping online)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""Kamego ya botho"" (social interaction) and ""go tsweledisiwa wa dikamano"" (relationship development) are considered important aspects of using the internet.  The options B and D directly relate to these aspects. 

""Go itsalanya ka tsa kgwebo"" (Shopping online) is about commerce and isn't directly linked to building social connections and relationships, which are the focus of the text. While online shopping *can* sometimes lead to interactions, it's not inherently a social activity in the same way as connecting with others or developing relationships.

Therefore, option A is the one that *doesn't* fall under the highlighted aspects of internet usage for social development according to the provided text.



"
"Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang, e e sa kayeng tlhotlheletso ya go dirisa inthanete go itsenyaletsa?","The correct answer is **D: Go leba tsamaiso ya tsa ditšhelete (To view financial transactions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""go ithuta"" (learning) and ""go tsalana le batho"" (socializing) are considered important motivations for using the internet. It also mentions ""kamego ya botho"" (community) and ""go tsweledisiwa wa dikamano"" (relationship development) as newer aspects of motivations.

While viewing financial transactions *can* be done online, it's not highlighted or presented as a core motivation or fundamental purpose of using the internet in the same way learning and socializing are. The passage focuses on social and educational aspects.

Therefore, option D is the one that doesn't fit the described motivations.
"
Ke leng fa Bophirima jwa Yuropa bo neng jwa lesa go ikamaganya thata le tlhotlheletso ga mmogo le go simolola kapari ya yone?,"The correct answer is **A: Middle Ages se ya fifing**.

Middle Ages se ya fifing, mafatshe a bophirima ja Yuropa a ne a simolola go itlhamela kapari ya bone.""  This directly links the beginning of the Middle Ages with the West of Europe starting to develop its own military traditions and banners.
"
Go dirisa dikonopo go kopela diaparo go nnile le ditlamorago tsa eng? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ka nako ya dintwa tsa tumelo**.

The text states: ""Nngwe ya ditlhabologo tsa nako tsa teng, ka ntateng ya dintwa tsa tumelo tsa di-crusades, e ne e le ya go dirisa dikonopo go gagamatsa dilwana."" This translates to: ""One of the innovations of the time, in the context of the tenets of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing."" Therefore, the use of buttons to fasten clothes was associated with the time of the Crusades.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e bonweng e le tharabololo e e dirileng sebaka se se leele ya mathata a tsa tikologo?","The correct answer is **C: Go bona gore ke eng se se bakang mathata** (To understand what is causing the problems).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding the root cause of environmental problems.** It uses the analogy of diagnosing an illness - you need to find the underlying issue, not just treat the symptoms.  The passage states ""Mme, fa re sa batle fela tharabololo ya nakwana, re tshwanetse go bona sesosa sa mathata, mme re tshwetse go se fedisa"" (And if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to see the root cause of the problem and try to fix it).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go ngala ditshwetso tsa botshelo jwa manobonobo** (To write down the symptoms of a disease): This is a symptom-focused approach, not a root-cause analysis.
* **B: Tiragatso** (Destruction):  While destruction is a consequence of environmental problems, it doesn't address *why* the destruction is happening.
* **D: Go nna thuso ya metsamao ya tsa tikologo** (To be a tool for environmental management): This is a *solution* or *tool*, not the initial step of understanding the problems.



Therefore, the passage directly connects understanding the cause of the problems to finding meaningful, long-term solutions.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya ditharabololo ya dilo tse di latelang e e bontshiwang e le kalafi e e bonalang ya mathata a tsa tikologo?","The correct answer is **B: Go bona sesosa sa mathata** (Seeing the root of the problem).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that simply focusing on solutions (like treating an illness) is not enough.  It argues that we need to **understand the underlying causes (sesosa sa mathata)** of environmental problems and address those root causes directly. This is stated clearly: ""Mme, fa re sa batle fela tharabololo ya nakwana, re tshwanetse go bona sesosa sa mathata, mme re tshwanetse go se fedisa."" (And if we don't just want short-term solutions, we need to see the root of the problem and end it.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Go tsenela tiragatso** (Entering chaos) - While environmental problems *can* lead to chaos, the passage isn't primarily about chaos itself.
*   **C: Go bua dikakanyo ka ga ditshwetso tsa botshelo jo bo magasigasi** (Discussing policies regarding unsustainable lifestyles) - This is part of addressing the root problem, but not the core concept *presented* in the passage. The passage argues for going *beyond* policies and understanding the underlying issues.
*   **D: Go tshela thata ka tsela e e kgonegang ya tikologo** (Living as hard as possible in an environmentally sound way) - This isn't directly mentioned or advocated in the passage. It's about making sacrifices, but the core idea is about understanding the *cause* of the problems first.

Ke naga efe e Yuropa e neng ya nna le ntwa ya ntlha e mathata a yone a konokono e neng gotwe a nyalana le go dirisa sentle maatla ntle le go tsenyeletsa ba bodumedi?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ntwa ya Boswa-ja-puso ya Spain ke yone ya ntlha e go neng go lwelwa dithata tsa go busa."" (The motto of Spain was the first to be fought over in the disputes of conquest.) and discusses Spain's power and its impact on the rest of Europe.
"
Ke ntwa efe e e mo gongwe e tlhalosiwang jaaka ‘ntwa ya bodumedi’?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntwa ya Dingwaga di le Masome a mararo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""“Ntwa ya Dingwaga di le Masome a Mararo” e ne e le ntwa ya bofelo go bidiwa ntwa ya tumelo."" This translates to ""'The Coat of Arms of the Thirty Years' was a symbol of hope, called the symbol of faith.""
"
Ke dilo dife tse di latelang tsa Kereke ya Katoliki tse di neng di sa tlhatlhobiwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Go tsenelela ga maatla mo teng ga Kereke.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Maatla a yone a a re nang gotlhe a amile mongwe le mongwe go simolola ka kgosi go fitlha ka motho wa maemo a a kwa tlase. Taolo ya botlhokwa ya kereke e nnile kwa Roma dingwaga di feta sekete mme kgobokanngwa gono ga maatla le madi mo lefelong le le nosi go ile ga dira go re bontsi bo ipotse go re a mme tumelo eno e a diragadiwa.""

This indicates that the concentration of power and wealth within the Church was a point of questioning and disapproval. The passage suggests that the immense power held by the Church, particularly in Rome, raised doubts about the validity of its faith.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa go bewa ga khumo ya Kereke e ne e siame:** The passage actually implies the opposite – that the *application* of faith (through the use of money) was being questioned.
*   **B: Fa ditheo tsa konokono di ne di fetolwa:** The passage does not mention the alteration of religious doctrines.
*   **D: Fa ditheo tsa konokono tsa Kereke di ne di diriwa ka moo go tshwanetseng:** The passage does not mention any issues with the doctrines being practiced properly.

"Go ya ka serapa, Ke mang yo o bolailweng ko Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Motlhokomedi**.

The text states: ""lekolo la mogoso le ile a tsikinya tlhogo ya motlhokomedi wa segosi yo o neng a bolawa kwa Versailles fa pele ga Kgosigadi e e neng a tshogile thata."" This translates to: ""the mob also broke the head of a courtier who had been killed at Versailles before the Queen who was very frightened.""

Ke efe ya tse di latelang e neng e sa patelediwa mo Kgosing le mo Kgosigading ya segopa?,"The correct answer is **A: Go bulwa ga difensetere tsa karana (The storming of the Bastille)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the mob *prevented* the King and Queen from escaping the prison-like conditions at Versailles. 
* The mob *did* threaten the royal family, and there was an incident involving the death of a guardsman.
* The passage explicitly mentions the King and Queen were being pressured to return to Paris.
* The passage mentions the guardsman's head being paraded, implying a threat, but *not* the storming of the Bastille itself.  The storming of the Bastille was a major event that happened *before* the King and Queen were pressured to return to Paris, though related to the overall events.

Therefore, the storming of the Bastille is the event that is *not* mentioned as a direct part of the circumstances surrounding the King and Queen's confinement and pressure to return to Paris.

The passage states: ""Borithane e epile metsi a boditšhabatšhaba go thibela dikepe dipe fela go re di se tsene mo dikarolong tsotlhe tsa lewatle, baya mo kotsing le e leng dikepe tse di sa tseyeng letlhakore."" This translates to ""Britain used naval blockades to prevent ships from entering all parts of the sea, endangering those ships that were not escorting them.""  This indicates that the ships *not* under escort were being left vulnerable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Keletso ya Jeremane ya go dirisa ditsela tsa ntwa e e tse di tshwanang:** The passage doesn't mention anything about Germany using similar naval tactics.
* **C: Diphetogo tse di dirilweng tsa molao wa lefatshe:** While there were changes to international law, the passage focuses on Britain's *tactical* use of blockades.
* **D: Didirisiwa tse di batlegang di ne di sa bonwe motlhofo:** The passage doesn't discuss the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of British deployments.

This means the blockade violated international law.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E ne e gakatsa ntwa ya Majeremane ya mo tlase ga lewatle:** The passage doesn't say the blockade was meant to provoke the German underwater base.
* **C: E ne e kgoreletsa motsamao wa dilwana tsa Jeremane:** The passage doesn't mention anything about disrupting German submarine movements.
* **D: E ile ya netefatsa gore dikepe tse e seng karolo ya ntwa di se ke tsa tshosediwa:** The passage states the blockade *targeted* non-combatant ships (dikepe tsa mo lewatleng tse di sa beelwang melelwane), not to ensure they weren't sunk.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a ka nna le Multiple Sclerosis thata?","The correct answer is **A: Mosadi wa dingwaga tse 32**.

The passage states that women are twice as likely to get MS than men. Option A, ""Mosadi wa dingwaga tse 32"" is the only option that aligns with this information.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, batsayakarolo mo ditirong tsa ka gale tse di batlang tshegetso e e kwa godimo ya eng?","The correct answer is **C: Kgatelelo ya maikutlo (Emotional distress)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Dipatlisiso di supa fa bolwetsi jwa kgatelelo ya maikutlo..."" which translates to ""Studies show that emotional distress..."".  The entire passage focuses on the emotional impact of trauma and the need for support related to it.  The passage links emotional distress to difficulties with self-regulation, lack of relaxation, and unusual physical symptoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga ba nne le ditlhabi (They don't have seizures):** The passage doesn't mention seizures.
* **B: Go bolaiwa ke mokwatla (Being a victim of abuse):** While the passage *mentions* being a victim of abuse as a contributing factor, the *primary focus* of the passage is on the resulting emotional distress.
* **D: Letshogo (Panic):** Panic is a symptom *of* emotional distress, not the underlying problem itself. The passage is talking about the broader issue of emotional distress, not just panic.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go bewa ga legora gantsi go tshamekiwa jang?","The correct answer is **B: Kwa univesithing**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Motshameko wa fencing wa segompieno o tshamikiwa ke batho ba maemo a a farologaneng jaaka baithuti mo yunivesithing go ya kwa go bomankge, go fitlelela kwa metshamekong ya mafatshefatshe ya di-Olimpiki."" This translates to: ""Modern fencing is practiced by people of different backgrounds as students at the university, going from there to international Olympic competitions.""

The question asks where fencing is often practiced. The passage explicitly mentions the university as a place where it's practiced by many.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wa segompieno (Modern):** This refers to the type of fencing, not the location where it's practiced.
*   **C: Metshamekong ya mafatshefatshe ya diolimpiki (International Olympic competitions):** This is the ultimate goal for some fencers, not the place where they typically start.
*   **D: Gantsi (Often):** While fencing is practiced often, the passage specifically points to the university as a common location.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e le letshwao le le tseneletseng ya botlhole jo bo moteng?","The correct answer is **B: Go tlhatsa go tlwaelegile thata**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Matshwao, a a tshwanang le go tlhatsa a tlwaelegile thata mo e leng go re tlhatlhobo ya ka bonako e ka se kgone go dirwa."" This translates to: ""Signs similar to itching are often difficult to see, meaning that the visible type cannot be done.""

The question asks what is a *typical* sign of a fungus. The passage highlights that *itching is difficult to see* when it comes to fungal infections.  Therefore, option B accurately reflects the information in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go tlhatsa (Itching):** While itching *can* be a symptom, the passage emphasizes the difficulty in *seeing* the itching, making it less of a clear sign than the difficulty in observing the fungus itself.
* **C: Dichefu tsa go phepafatsa ntlo (Household cleaning products):**  This is irrelevant to the question.
* **D: sejana se se bulegileng sa melemo (Open wound with beneficial bacteria):** This is also irrelevant to the question.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke kgato efe e e tshwanetseng ya ntlha fa o tlhatlhoba motho yo o amegileng?","The correct answer is **C: Lemoga maemo a motswasetlhabelo fa o mo atamela.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the *most important* thing to do when caring for an elderly person.** The provided text emphasizes understanding their physical condition (""lemoga maemo a motswasetlhabelo fa o mo atamela"") as a fundamental aspect of care.
* While the other options are good suggestions, they are secondary to understanding the person's current state:
    * **A: Sekaseka gore a mme ga o mo diphatseng:**  While important for comfort, this is a *result* of understanding their needs, not the primary action.
    * **B: Sekaseka gore a mme ga o mo diphatseng:** Same as A.
    * **D: Fa o utlwa botlhoko, o thusa, o dira gore dilo di nne maswe le go feta:** This is a response to a specific situation (feeling scared), not the overall principle of elderly care.

Therefore, understanding their physical condition is the core principle highlighted in the text, making option C the best answer.
"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang a sa tlhaloseng sentle tsamaiso ya go lemoga motswasetlhabelo?,"The correct answer is **A: O se ka wa thusa fa o utlwa botlhoko.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks which phrase *doesn't* clearly describe how to recognize a situation of distress.** Option A is vague. While helping someone who is scared is a good thing, it doesn't directly address the *process* of recognizing distress. It only describes a reaction.

Let's look at why the other options *do* describe the process:

* **B: Lemoga maemo a motswasetlhabelo pele ga fa o mo atamela.** (Recognize the situation of distress *before* approaching them.) This is a key step – assessing the situation first is crucial.
* **C: Lemoga maemo a motswasetlhabelo fa o mo atamela.** (Recognize the situation of distress *when* you approach them.) This also highlights the importance of assessing the situation as you interact.
* **D: Se dire gore dilo di nne maswe le go feta.** (Make things easier and go beyond.) This suggests taking action, but it doesn't describe how to *identify* the distress in the first place.

Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't clearly explain how to recognize a situation of distress."
Ke diphetogo dife tse di batliwang thata ke Tshenolo ya SeFora e neng e nale thotloetso thata mo badiring?,"The correct answer is **A: Tshegetso e e tswang ko godimo ya setšhaba (Leadership from above the nation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go na le morago ga Bomenolapuso ditiro di ne tsa bulegela bakopi ba tiro ba banna botlhe mme seo sa dira go re bao ba ikaeletseng go atlega le go feta le bao ba atlegang ba tswelele pele mo botshelong. Gape morago ga Tsogela puso kgatlhanong, go ne gape ga rotloetsa badiri ba bangwe ba bantsi ba ba gateletsweng, ma mafatshe a mangwe, go tsogela dipuso tsa bone kgatlhanong.""

This implies that people were encouraged to take initiative and lead, suggesting a shift *from* top-down leadership *to* leadership emerging from the people themselves. Option A, ""Tshegetso e e tswang ko godimo ya setšhaba"" (Leadership from above the nation), represents the *opposite* of this desired shift. The passage indicates a move *away* from leadership from above.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Go ntsha mogopolo go tswa mo bathong go ya ko kgaisanong (Developing initiative from the people to cooperation)** - While the passage mentions people taking initiative, it doesn't explicitly state that cooperation was the primary goal.
*   **C: Go gapiwa ga kgopolo ya Rephaboliki (Granting the initiative of a Republic)** - The passage discusses the shift towards a republic, but doesn't emphasize this as a difficult change *for workers*.
*   **D: Tsmaiso e ntšhwa ya go lekantsha (A new management system of measurement)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer because the passage implies a desire for leadership to emerge from the people, which is the antithesis of ""Leadership from above the nation."""
"Go latelana le Tshenolo ya Fora, katlego mo masoleng le ditiro tse dingwe tse di ne di beilwe mo go eng?","The correct answer is **A: Phitlhelelo (Democracy)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the transition from a business government to a republic and a state where the nation belongs to all citizens, not just rulers. This is the core principle of democracy. The gathering at Fora further encouraged other nations to seek democracy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Setlhopha (Clique):**  The passage is explicitly contrasting democracy with a system where power is held by a select few.
* **C: Go gagamalela maemo (Seeking position):** While some might seek positions, the passage emphasizes a broader shift in governance.
* **D: Maemo (Status/Position):**  The passage is about the *source* of status and position, not the status itself.  It's about a system where status isn't inherited but earned.



"
Ke tirelo efe ya setšhaba e gotweng ke yone e bakang go sa kgotsofale mo dinageng tse di tlhabologileng?,"The best answer is **B: Go phutlhama ga marogo**. Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go thata go utlwa batho ba ikuela ba sa kgwe mathe ka boleng jwa metsi kgotsa go phutlhama ga marogo kwa mafatsheng a a tlhabologileng."" This directly links concerns about disease outbreaks to a lack of trust in public services.  While water quality is mentioned, disease outbreaks are presented as a more significant and immediate concern driving skepticism.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Boleng jwa metsi:** While water quality *is* a public service, the passage presents disease outbreaks as a more impactful reason for distrust.
* **C: Dipalangwa tsa botlhe:**  This is too broad.  The passage focuses on specific problems (water quality and disease).
* **D: Thuto:** The passage doesn't mention education as a factor in distrust.

Therefore, the link between the stated difficulties in trusting public services and the constant worry about disease outbreaks makes **B: Go phutlhama ga marogo** the most accurate answer.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go ka tweng ka tsamaiso ya dipalangwa tsa botlhe?","The best answer is **C: Di baka gore batho ba bantsi ba ba di dirisang ba ngongorege.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* people don't trust public utilities.**  The passage states that many people are wary of them. Option C directly addresses this, suggesting the utilities *cause* this distrust.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Botlhe ba dirisa dipagamo tsa sechaba.**  This is a basic statement of fact and doesn't explain the distrust.
* **B: Batho ba ikuela ba sa kgwe mathe ka boleng jwa metsi.** While related to potential concerns, this is a *specific* concern, not the overarching reason for distrust.
* **D: Mo dinageng tse dintsi tse di tlhabologileng.** This just states where this is happening, not *why* it's happening.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and logical explanation based on the information provided in the passage. The passage implies that something about how public utilities operate leads to people being suspicious.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e ka nnang boima go e lekantsha ka ntlha ya bakgweetsi ba ba sa itsegeng?","The correct answer is **D: Go tsamaya ga pharakano (Traffic flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that analyzing traffic flow (the movement of vehicles) is a major task in road safety and can be done even with independent drivers. However, it emphasizes that it's *more* beneficial when drivers act similarly and consistently.  This implies that analyzing traffic flow is more difficult to accurately assess when drivers are unpredictable or don't follow consistent patterns, which is more likely among those who don't adhere to traffic rules.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Palo ya pharakano (Traffic volume):**  This is relatively straightforward to measure (number of vehicles).
* **B: Leano la ditsela (Road design):**  Road design is a fixed factor and easier to analyze.
* **C: Tiriso ya tsela (Road usage):** While related to traffic flow, it's a broader term. The passage focuses specifically on the *movement* of vehicles, making ""traffic flow"" a more precise distinction.



Therefore, **Go tsamaya ga pharakano (Traffic flow)** is the most difficult to accurately evaluate when dealing with drivers who don't follow established patterns or rules.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e dirisitsweng fa go diriwa dipalo tse di bontshitsweng tsa pharakano?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditiro tsa tsela (Traffic rules)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""Maduo a a tsepameng ka pharakano ya dikoloi...a amantswe dintlha dikgolo tse tharo: (1) go elela ga dikoloi (2) bokete kwa dikoloi le (3) lobelo la dikoloi.""  These three elements directly relate to **traffic rules** - how cars are positioned, how much space exists between them, and the appropriate distances to maintain.

The other options are less relevant:

*   **B: Mokgwa wa mokgweetsi (Driver's behavior)** is a contributing factor, but the core data analysis relies on the rules that govern behavior.
*   **C: Tsela eo ditsela di dirilweng ka yone (How roads are designed)** is a factor in traffic flow, but the data analysis focuses on *how traffic behaves* within the existing road design.
*   **D: Bontsi jwa pharakano (Amount of traffic)** is a *result* of traffic rules and behavior, not the *basis* of the data analysis itself. The analysis breaks down traffic based on adherence to traffic rules.



"
Ke eng se Hershey le Chase ba se dirisitsweng go tsenya di-DNA tsa bone? ,"The correct answer is **A: Phosphorus ya Marang a a kotsi**.

Here's why:

* **Hershey and Chase used radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of the bacteriophage.**  They then observed whether the radioactive phosphorus ended up inside the bacteria.  Since DNA contains phosphorus, this experiment helped them determine that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Togwa ya dijini:** While they were trying to prove DNA *was* the genetic material, the question asks *what they used to introduce their DNA*.
* **C: Salefa ya Marang a a kotsi:**  They used radioactive phosphorus, not sulfur. Sulfur is a component of proteins.
* **D: Megare:** They used bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) *to carry* the DNA, but the question asks what they used to label or introduce *their own DNA*.



"
Bokgoni jwa go fetoga ga dijini tse di fetiseditsweng mo losikeng e ikaegile mo go eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa disele tse di amegileng e le tsa losika lwa mogare wa disele.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Phetogo ya dilo ya losika mogare wa disele ke yone fela e e kgonang go fetela ko baneng..."" (The chromosomal translocation of chronic myeloid leukemia is the only one capable of transformation in humans...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Botlhokwa jwa togwa ya dijini:** While chromosomal translocations involve genes, the question is specifically about *what* makes the transformation possible. The importance of the gene translocation is a contributing factor, but not the defining element.
* **C: Mofuta wa phetogo:** The type of mutation is important, but the passage narrows it down to the specific translocation of chronic myeloid leukemia.
* **D: Fa phetogo e ka baka loso lwa disele:**  While mutations *can* cause leukemia, the passage focuses on the *ability to transform* into something else.  It's not just about causing leukemia in general.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e filweng mo serapeng, ditlamorago tsa diphetogo tse di sa tshwaneng ga di a ikaega ka eng?","The correct answer is **C: Fa diteng tsa botlhokwa tsa dijini di amegileng ka gone**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the mutations that are *not* self-sustaining (i.e., don't lead to cancer or death) occur when **important functions of the gene are mutated**.  The passage emphasizes that only mutations in the *locus of the tumor suppressor gene* are capable of leading to cancer.  Therefore, the crucial factor is the mutation affecting the gene's functionality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gore togwa ya dijini e amega go le kana ka eng:** While mutations in the gene are involved, the *specific* aspect of the mutation is what matters.
* **B: Fa disele tsa losika le megare di amegileng ka gone:**  The passage implies the *gene* mutation is the critical element, not necessarily the mutation of the tumor suppressor gene itself.
* **D: Mofuta wa phetogo e e amegileng:**  The passage doesn't specify the *type* of mutation, only that it affects important functions.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e seng lebaka la gobo ditso tsa kgale di ileng tsa boloka dipodi?,"The correct answer is **B: Di ne di thusa go fula lefatshe (They helped to till the land)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the sheep were herded for their wool, meat, and milk. Options A (nama - meat), C (ditsala - plants), and D (maši - milk) are all things the sheep provided.

The text *doesn't* mention the sheep being used for tilling the land. Therefore, option B is not supported by the provided text.
"
Mokgele wa golofo ke go tsaya eng e nnye?,"The correct answer is **D: Mesima**.

The passage describes a golf course with holes and mentions the ""mesima"" (holes) multiple times. The question asks what a golf course is for, and the passage implies it's for playing *in* the holes (mesima).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dibolo (Balls):** Golf is played *with* balls, but the passage doesn't define what a golf course *is*.
* **B: Go kgotletsa (To Rest):** While golfers might rest, the primary purpose isn't rest.
* **C: Nako (Time):** Time is relevant to the game, but not what the golf course *is*.



"
"Mo lebaleng la golofo,  tlhaga e ne e kgaotswe gore e nne khutshwane kae?","The correct answer is **B: Ko botaleng.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Motshameko o tshamekelwa mo tlhageng, mme tlhaga e e gaufi le mosima e kgaolwa bokhutshwane thata mme e bidiwa """"ko botaleng"""".""  This translates to: ""The hole is located in the green, and the area near the hole is heavily mowed and called """"the fringe"""".""
"
"Ke efe ya mothale yo, e e dirisiwang thata mo dipatlisisong?","The correct answer is **D: Mo dipatlisisong tsa maranyane.**

The passage states: ""Mothale ôno ke one baitseanape ba o dirisang thata mo dipatlisisong tsa maranyane."" This translates to ""That mothale is the one who is used a lot in small searches.""

Therefore, the answer is D.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se sa thuseng go batlisisa ka maranyane?","The correct answer is **D: Go dira diteko** (To conduct experiments).

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions that young children are very good at making observations and conducting simple experiments.** The example of the German soldiers with their uniforms illustrates a simple observation – they didn't need to put on a coat even when it was cold.
* **Experiments are a core part of the scientific method and crucial for understanding how things work.**  The passage implies that this kind of simple experimentation is key to scientific inquiry.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go dira tsela e nngwe ya saense (To conduct a scientific method):** While important, this is a broad term. The passage focuses on the *simple* aspect of observation and experimentation.
* **B: Go dira ditshekatsheko (To make inferences/guesses):** Inferences are not the same as scientific investigation.  While inferences can be *based* on observations, they aren't a method for testing hypotheses.
* **C: Go ntsha dikakanyo tse di kgonegang (To make logical deductions):** Logical deductions are important, but the passage emphasizes hands-on exploration and testing, which is what experiments provide.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya mafoko a tlhalosang ka ga ditsuatsue e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Ditsuatsue di kgona go senya sengwe le sengwe mo di leng gone.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Thoromo ya lefatshe e tlhasela thata mafelo a mannye fa o bapisa le ditiragalo tse dingwe tsa tlhago, fela di ka senya sengwe le sengwe mo tseleng.""  This directly translates to: ""The earthquake strongly shakes the ground compared to other natural phenomena, but it can damage anything in its path.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditsuatsue di ama mafelo a mannye go na le diphefo tse dingwe** - The passage says earthquakes *shake* the ground, not necessarily *destroy* things in the same way other disasters do.
* **C: Bontsi jwa ditsuatsue bo tsaya go feta diura tse tharo** - The passage specifically mentions that large earthquakes can last three hours, but doesn't state that *most* earthquakes do.
* **D: Ditsuatsue tse dingwe di kgona go dikologa go fitlha sekgala sa dikilomitara tse 482 ka ura e le nngwe** - While the passage mentions a specific earthquake's speed, it doesn't say that *all* earthquakes travel at that speed.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang a tlhalosang sentle bontsi jwa ditsuatsue?","The correct answer is **C: Di ama mafelo a mannye go feta diphefo tse dingwe.**

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Thoromo ya lefatshe e tlhasela thata mafelo a mannye fa o bapisa le ditiragalo tse dingwe tsa tlhago..."" (Earthquakes strongly shake the ground compared to other natural disasters...).
* It also mentions that ""Ditsuatsue tsa diphefo di kumola ditlhare, dikgagola dikagong, dikukela dikoloi mo phefong."" (Earthquakes break rocks, cracks the earth, and destroys cars in houses).
* The key point is the comparison to other natural disasters.  The passage emphasizes that earthquakes are *more* powerful in their shaking than other events.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Di tsaya sebaka sa diura tse tharo** (They cover an area of three hours):  This refers to a distance covered, not the strength of the shaking.
* **B: Di dikologa dikilomitara tse 772 ka ura e le nngwe** (They cover 772 kilometers per hour):  This is a speed, not a description of the shaking's intensity.  It seems to be a misinterpretation of the provided speed of the tsunami.
* **D: Di kgona go ntsha ditlhare go tswa ko meding** (They can break rocks from the mountains):  While earthquakes can cause this, the passage doesn't highlight this as the defining characteristic of earthquakes; it focuses on the overall shaking.



Therefore, option C best summarizes the main point about earthquakes – their powerful shaking compared to other natural disasters.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e ile ya simolola go diriwa ke batho mo lekgolong la bo 16 la dingwaga?,"The correct answer is **D: Go dira di thelesekoupu (To make telescopes)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Le fa go ntse jalo, **di-telescope tsa ntlha tsa go bontsha dinaledi di dirilwe kwa Yuropa go ela kwa bowelong jwa lekgolo la bo-16 la dingwaga.**"" (Even so, the first telescopes to show stars were made in Europe during the 16th century.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go dirisa dilense (To use lenses):**  While lenses were known and used earlier, the passage emphasizes the *development* of telescopes *using* lenses in the 16th century.
* **B: Didiriswa tsa go godisa mafoko (Printing presses):** Printing presses were developed much earlier than the 16th century.
* **C: Go dira lense (To make lenses):**  Making lenses was a precursor to telescopes, but the passage focuses on the creation of the telescopes themselves, not just the lenses.



"
Batho ba ntse ba dirisa didirisiwa tsa go godisa ba dirisa dilense lobaka lo lo kae?,"The correct answer is **D: Go simologa ka tshimologo ya lekgolo la bo 16 la dingwaga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batho ba tswa kgakala ba dirisa digalase tsa go bonela koteng dingwaga di le diketekete tse dintsi. Le fa go ntse jalo, di-telescope tsa ntlha tsa go bontsha dinaledi di dirilwe kwa Yuropa go ela kwa bowelong jwa lekgolo la bo-16 la dingwaga.""

This translates to: ""People have been using glasses to see far for many years. However, the first telescopes to show stars were made in Europe at the beginning of the 16th century.""

Therefore, telescopes, a form of lens-based device for magnification, *began* to be used around the beginning of the 16th century.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, legaga la ga Muhammad le bua eng ka ditiro tsa gagwe tsa semoya kgotsa boleng?","The correct answer is **A: O bontsha boleng jwa kagiso le go batla go nna a le nosi (He demonstrates a spirit of peace and a desire to be solitary).**

Here's why:

*   The passage states Muhammad would retreat to a cave called ""Hira"" in the mountains near Mecca to meditate. 
*   The cave was isolated, dark, and remote.
*   The passage emphasizes his desire for solitude and his ability to focus there. 
*   This isolation points to a spiritual seeking and a preference for peace and quiet, not outward displays or attention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Modumo wa ko ntle o ka thusa go tlhatlhanya (The external world can help with purification):** The passage doesn't suggest that the external world is helpful for Muhammad's purification. Instead, he seeks purification through isolation.
*   **C: O tlhoka nako e nnye a le nosi (He needs time alone):** While true, option A is a better *interpretation* of *why* he needs that time alone. It connects the solitude to a deeper spiritual desire.
*   **D: O ne a tshwenyegile ka go bonwa le go utlwiwa (He was afraid of being seen and heard):** The passage indicates the opposite. He *seeks* isolation and doesn't seem afraid of being alone.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, tshipi e ne e dirisediwa eng pele?","The correct answer is **C: Maotwana (Felt)**.

The passage states: "" Mme ne ga lemogwa go re seporo se ka dira botoka fa go na le tshipi fa gadimo. Se se ne sa nna tlwaelo, mme tshipi ya seporo e ne senya maotwana a logong a dikolotsana.""  This translates to: ""It was not noticed that a felt could make the coat brittle if there was a lining on top. It was customary, and the felt lining would damage the natural wool of the coats.""  This indicates that felt was initially used to line the coats, and it was later found to damage the natural wool.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, gore go ntshitswe maotwana a magong ka maotwana a tshipi?","The correct answer is **A: A ne a oketsa lobelo la dipitsi (They improved the ability of the wheels to turn)**.

The passage states that the original wheel spokes were problematic because they could break if a knot appeared on top. This led to the idea of using iron spokes instead. The passage also mentions that the iron spokes were eventually moved to be used for the hub, and the wooden spokes were used for the rim.  Therefore, the reason for switching to iron spokes was to improve the wheel's ability to rotate smoothly and withstand more stress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A ne a tsewa e le a dirang sentle (They were known to be excellent)** - While iron spokes might have been *better*, the passage doesn't explicitly say they were widely *known* to be excellent.  The primary driver was addressing the breakage problem.
* **C: Di kgona go tsaya dithoto tse dintsi (They could hold more loads)** - The passage doesn't directly link the spokes to the wheel's load-bearing capacity.  While stronger spokes *might* indirectly contribute, it's not the stated reason.
* **D: Di ne di tsofadiwa ke tshipi mo maotong (They were protected by the hub in the axles)** - The passage mentions the spokes being moved to the hub, but this was a *later development* and not the *reason* for replacing wooden spokes with iron.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se mongwe le mongwe a neng a kgona go se dira ka nako ya Lorato?","The correct answer is **C: Ditlwaelo (Beliefs/Ideals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Romanticism rejected rigid rules (""melao e e beilweng fela"") and emphasized the importance of feeling, imagination, and a connection to the world and people.  This aligns directly with the rejection of strict adherence to established norms and the embracing of individual beliefs and ideals, which is what ""ditlwaelo"" represents.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Melao (Rules):** The passage explicitly says Romanticism rejected rules.
* **B: Popego ya lefelo (Tradition/Customs):** While Romanticism reacted against tradition, the passage focuses more on internal beliefs and feelings than on external traditions.
* **D: Ditso (Facts/Knowledge):** The passage emphasizes feeling and imagination over objective facts.

Ke efe ya mafoko a a tlhalosang a sa bontsheng kakantsho ya kakaretso ka go tlhomamisega ga thekelonoloji? ,"The correct answer is **B: Go tlhamiwa ga thekenoloji ga go a amiwa ke setso (Technology adoption is not determined by culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: *""Bontsi jwa ditlhaloso tsa setegeniki di na le dikakanyo tse pedi: go re tlhabololo ya setegeniki ka bo yone e latela tsela e e fetang ngwao kgotsa tlhotlheletso ya dipolitiki, le thekenoloji e ko bofelong e nang le """"ditlamorogo"""" mo sechabeng ka kakaretso mme e seng go fetolwa ke botsalano.""*

This means the passage rejects the idea that technology adoption is solely driven by technological or political factors. It posits that *social factors* are also at play. Option B directly reflects this rejection of a purely technological determinism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka moo thekenoloji e amang botsalano jwa setshaba ka gone (Where technology affects public interaction)**: This is a true statement *within* the passage, but it doesn't represent a statement *denying* complete technological determinism.
* **C: Thekenoloji e ama tlholego mo setšabeng (Technology affects society)**:  This is also a true statement *within* the passage, but it doesn't reject the idea that society has an influence on technology.
* **D: Kgolo ya thekenoloji ga ya ikaega ka tlhotlheletso ya dipolotiki (Technological growth is completely independent of political ideology)**: This is directly contradicted by the passage, which says technology's growth is *influenced* by political ideology.



Therefore, option B is the only one that accurately describes a perspective *against* complete technological determinism.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang ga di a amana le go goga thapo e e bofilweng?","The correct answer is **D: Go simologa mo segwagweng (ko e le gone letsogo la ga go le tshware bora)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tlase go raya go re o tshwanetswa wa simolola ko segogwaneng (ko e le gone letsogo la ga go le tshware bora) o bo o goga bora."" This translates to ""down-bow implies that you should start on the frog (where the bow is held) and draw it to the right.""  The question asks what relates to drawing the bowstring.  The passage directly connects the ""down-bow"" technique with starting on the frog and drawing the bow.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Modumo o o sa tsenelelang (Unstable pattern):**  The text doesn't mention anything about an unstable pattern.
* **B: Letshwao le le tshwanang le seteipole (Pattern similar to tape):**  The text doesn't make this comparison.
* **C: Modumo o o tseneletseng (Complete pattern):** While a down-bow is part of a complete archery technique, the passage focuses on the starting point on the frog.

Therefore, the only answer directly linked to the passage's description of the ""down-bow"" technique and drawing the bowstring is option D.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe e e latelang e amanang le modumo o o siameng?","The correct answer is **D: Go simologa mo letsogo la gago le tshwereng thapo e e bofilweng.**

Here's why:

The passage describes ""up-bow"" as starting at the bottom and moving upwards, creating a curve upwards. It also describes ""down-bow"" as starting at the top and moving downwards, creating a curve downwards.  Option D directly reflects the description of ""down-bow"": ""Go simologa mo letsogo la gago le tshwereng thapo e e bofilweng"" translates to ""Starting from the top and wrapping the string.""

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Letshwao la mo fatshe la thapo e e bofilweng** (Bottom shape of a wrapped string): This describes the *result* of the down-bow, not the *process* of creating it.
*   **B: Go goga thapo e e bofilweng** (Pulling a wrapped string): This describes an action that can be performed with a wrapped string, but it's not the specific starting point and direction of a down-bow.
*   **C: Letshwao le le lebegang jaaka V** (A shape resembling a V): This describes an up-bow, but the passage focuses on the downward-bow.

Therefore, option D is the only one that accurately corresponds to the description of the down-bow in the passage."
Marapo a kgale a a bontshang maemo kwa tshimologong go ya ka se se latelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Go tsamaya**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the evolution of the human foot, with its arched structure and forward-pointing big toe, is linked to bipedalism (walking on two legs).
* The passage contrasts this with chimpanzees, which have feet designed for grasping.
* The mention of fossil evidence spanning millions of years further supports the idea of an evolutionary shift towards walking upright.

Therefore, the fossil evidence primarily points to the evolution of the foot *for walking*.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tlhalosang sentle dipente tsa marapo a menwana a chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **A: A tlhamaletse go nale a batho (Are elongated)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Leoto la tshwene ya chimpanzi ratile go lekana le letsogo la yone ka bophara le boleele."" (The bones of a chimpanzee's foot are adapted to be wide and flat).
* **It further explains:** ""Se se supa go re letsogo le dirisiwa gape go jara bokete jwa mmele wa yone fa e tsamaya ka matsogo."" (This suggests the bones are adapted for walking on all fours).
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Masaledi a marapo a diatla a dingwaga di le dimilione tse pedi go ya go dimilione tse tharo a bontsha phetogo eno mo go kgethegeng ga seatla go tloga mo go itsamaiseng go ya taolo."" (Million-year fossil records show this adaptation in the skeletal structure evolving from quadrupedal to bipedal).

Therefore, the key feature of chimpanzee foot bones highlighted in the passage is their elongation, which is a step towards bipedalism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matsogo le maoto a yone ga a lekane ka bogolo (Its legs and feet are not large enough):** The passage explicitly says the bones are *adapted* and *wide and flat*, suggesting they are sufficient and even specially designed for a certain purpose.
* **C: Di dirisiwa go sikara boima (They are used to bear weight):** While bones *do* bear weight, the passage focuses on the *adaptation* of the bones for walking in a specific way, not just weight-bearing.
* **D: Di dirisediwa sentlentlele go tsietsa (They are used for climbing):**  The passage focuses on the adaptation for walking, not climbing."
Tlhopo e ntsha go sa tshwane ga dijini tse diša go tswa mo go tsefeng tse di leng gone?,"The correct answer is **C: Di kgaogantshitswe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the emergence of digital technology ""leads to the introduction of a new digital paradigm, which pushes the group to leave the group of traditional paradigms.""  It also says that ""recognition and merging are used to reflect the future and past changes within the two groups, respectively.""

Therefore, the new digital paradigms *emerge* (kgaogantshitswe) as a result of the changes. The other options don't fit the context.
"
Ke efe ya tsamaiso e e nang le maikarabelo mo go oketseng dijini tse di sa tshwaneng?,"The correct answer is **B: Di kopantshitswe (Combined)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go kgaoganngwa le go kopanngwa gape go refosanya phetogo kwa pele le kwa morago fa gare ga ditlhopha tse pedi mo kokomaneng nngwe le nngwe.""  This translates to: ""The joining and combining also reflect the change both forward and backward within the two groups that are divided."" 

Therefore, the key action is the **combination** of the previously separate groups (the ""forward"" and ""backward"" aspects) to form a new, combined group containing the ""digital"" algorithms.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di kgaogantshitswe (Are created/generated):** While new algorithms are created, the question is about what *happens* to the existing, ""digital"" algorithms.
* **C: Go oketsega (Are increased/grow):** The passage doesn't talk about an increase in the number of algorithms, but rather a change in their structure.
* **D: Di bontshitswe (Are shown/displayed):** The passage doesn't mention display or presentation.

"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng, ke efe ya tseno e e ka bonalang e ka jega go rarabolola “bothata jwa poreiteine”?","The correct answer is **B: Dinawa tse di sa butswang (Uncooked meat)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dikutla tse di tswang mo dimeleng tse di itlhelelwang bonolo e ne e ka nna poreteine e e bonwang bonolo mo matlhareng le **dinawa tse di sa butswang**, mme fela, di di thata gore di ka silwa ke mebele ya batho fa di sa apeiwe."" (Proteins from easily accessible tissues could be found easily in meat and **uncooked meat**, but they are difficult for human predators to digest if not cooked.)

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions uncooked meat as a food source that animals have evolved to digest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Matlhare a a suleng (Raw fish):** The passage doesn't mention raw fish in relation to how animals solve their protein problem.
*   **C: Ditsie (Insects):** The passage refers to insects as a food source but doesn't link them directly to how animals solve their protein problems.
*   **D: Dikutu tsa malomo (Mouth parts):** Mouth parts are not a food source, so they are irrelevant to this question.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya mathata a a latelang e e sa bakiweng ke go tlhoma diasiti ya amino e e tlhokegang?","The correct answer is **C: Kgolo ya kgatelelo ya mogopolo (Kidney failure)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the body's kidneys struggle to process the amino acids from insects because it can lead to kidney failure. Options A and B are not mentioned as direct consequences of amino acid processing. Option D, while mentioned as a potential outcome, is linked to severe kidney problems, not just amino acid processing itself.
"
Maloko a setso se se rileng gantsi a bontsha jang gore a amana le setlhopha?,"The best answer is **A: Ka go batla go amogelwa** (By seeking to be accepted).

Here's why:

The passage states that subcultures form among people with shared characteristics who feel marginalized by the dominant culture and want to define themselves.  The core motivation for this is *acceptance* and belonging within a group that understands them.  

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **B: Ka go dira se bodumedi jwa batho botlhe ba ba ba potileng** (By demonstrating the friendship of all those who are disadvantaged) - While friendship might be a component, the primary drive is the shared identity and belonging that leads to acceptance.
* **C: Ka go dira ka moo batho ba dirang dilo ka gone** (By creating a place where people do things together) -  Shared activities are important for a subculture, but creating a place is a *result* of seeking acceptance and defining oneself, not the primary reason for interacting.
* **D: Ka go dirisa setaele jaaka tsela ya setshwantsho** (By using symbolism as a form of representation) - Symbolism is a *tool* subcultures use to communicate and create identity, but it's not the *reason* they interact in the first place.



Therefore, seeking acceptance is the most fundamental reason why subcultures form and how they relate to a broader group."
"Go ya ka kgopolo e e leng mo serapeng, go ka direga eng ka ngwana yo o bontshang a tswa mo lotsong lo lo rileng le le nang le mokgwa wa go akanya ka boitshwaro jo bo tshosetsang?","The correct answer is **B: Ngwana go ka direga thata gore a itshware ka tsela e e tshosang.**

Here's why:

* The question describes a situation where a child comes from a family where poor academic performance is tolerated and even accepted. This environment makes it *difficult* for the child to develop a strong sense of responsibility and self-discipline.
* Option A (""Ngwana ga a kitla a itshwara ka tsela e e tshosang"") is too absolute. While it's likely to be challenging, it's not impossible.
* Option C (""Ngwana ga a kitla a tsaya karolo mo maemong a a botsalano"") is irrelevant to the core issue of self-discipline and responsibility.
* Option D (""Ngwana ga a kitla a dumela go tsaya karolo mo dilong tse dingwe tse di amanang le lotso lo lo rileng"") is also irrelevant and doesn't address the central problem.

The key takeaway is that a family culture that doesn't value academic success makes it harder for a child to internalize the importance of good behavior and self-regulation.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, kitso ya ngwana ka go akanya ka ditsela tse di rileng ka lotso go ka nna le ditlamorago dife tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **B: Boitshwaro (Behavior)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the consequences of a child's thought process related to social situations and school performance.** The passage states that children who feel their families are disappointed in them for not doing well at school experience negative consequences.
* **Option B (Behavior) directly reflects this.**  If a child believes their family disapproves, they are likely to change their behavior, often to avoid further disappointment. This could manifest as improved academic performance, more effort, or altering their social interactions.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Lotso lo lo rileng le ba tlhophiwang go itsege ka lone (Feeling insecure and being stigmatized):** While related, this is a *feeling* and a *perception* stemming from the thought process, not a direct consequence *of* the thought process in the way behavior is.
* **C: Botsalano le bana ba bangwe (Social interaction with other children):**  While the passage mentions social dynamics, the primary consequence linked to the thought process is how the child *acts* (their behavior).
* **D: Tlhaloso ya bone ya lotso (Their perception of themselves):** This is also a consequence of the thought process, but it's a more internal, cognitive consequence. The question asks about broader consequences.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e neng e sa tsamaisane le go gola ga ngwana wa phage?","The correct answer is **B: Bokgoni jo bo boteng jwa puo (Language skills)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""diphologotswana"" (children with severe neglect, abuse, or trauma) and how they often exhibit behaviors similar to their abusers.  It also mentions that some may have been severely deprived as infants, leading to difficulties in forming attachments and experiencing fear.

The passage *doesn't* say these children have difficulties with language skills. It focuses on emotional and behavioral development.  The other options are all things a child *could* struggle with due to trauma and neglect:

*   **A: Go itshelela (Attachment):**  The text explicitly states they often struggle with forming attachments.
*   **C: Mekgwa ya go itlhaola (Self-regulation):** Trauma often impairs self-regulation.
*   **D: Go tshaba go nna mogare ga batho (Fear of people):**  The passage mentions fear and difficulty forming attachments.

Therefore, language skills are the most unlikely to be negatively impacted by the described experiences.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e tlhalosang sentle mekgwa ya bophage ya bana?","The correct answer is **A: Boitshwaro jwa bophage ka bontsi bo bakiwa ke go golafala mo mmeleng.**

Here's why:

The passage states that some children who develop ""phologotswana"" (which translates to ""animalistic"" or ""bestial"") behaviors are *raised* by animals.  It also mentions that children can be born with these behaviors due to trauma, abuse, or neglect.  

However, the key point is that if raised by animals, the child *copies* the animal's behavior.  The passage says, ""If raised by animals only, the child develops a range of behaviors identical to the animal that raised them (as much as the body allows), such as fear and indifference to people.""

Option A directly reflects this: behavior is largely determined by physical development, especially when raised by animals.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Boitshwaro jwa bophage bo ka bakiwa ke go tlhoka go itsalanya le batho:**  While trauma and neglect *involving* people can contribute, the core of the animalistic behavior isn't about needing to socialize. It's about mimicking the behavior of an animal.
* **C: Boitshwaro jwa bophage bo tshwara bana ba batsadi ba bone ba ba tshwarang thata:**  The passage mentions difficult upbringing *as a cause*, but it's not the primary determining factor if raised by an animal.  It's about the *environment* (animal) shaping the behavior.
* **D: Boitshwaro jotlhe jwa bophage bo bakiwa ke bogole jo bo tseneletseng jwa tlhaloganyo:** The passage doesn't suggest that animalistic behavior is caused solely by a mental defect. Trauma, environment and physical development are key contributing factors.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya mekgwa e e latelang e sa tsamaelaneng le temo-thuo ya itshetso?","The correct answer is **B: Go dira dijo tse di rekisediwang ba bangwe (To have someone else prepare the food)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines self-reliance as using stored resources and skills (like gardening, preserving, etc.) to provide for oneself and one's family.** It emphasizes independence and utilizing what's available.

Let's break down the options:

* **A: Go tsepamisa mogopolo mo thobong e e lekanang ditlhokego tsa lelwapa la molemi (Focusing on the amount of food to meet the family's needs):** This aligns with self-reliance because it's about planning and ensuring sufficient food supply, a key aspect of providing for oneself.
* **B: Go dira dijo tse di rekisediwang ba bangwe (To have someone else prepare the food):** This is the *opposite* of self-reliance. It indicates dependence on others and a lack of control over food preparation.
* **C: Go itebaganya le thobo e e kwa godimo go na le go dirisa methale ya botsipa ja maemo a a fa godimo (To have a rooftop garden and use hydroponics or other advanced techniques):** This *can* be self-reliant, as it utilizes skills and resources to grow food, although it might require some initial investment.  The key here is the *skill and resourcefulness* used.
* **D: Go batla dipeo tsa selegae mo lefelong la molemi (To seek local resources in the family's garden):** This aligns with self-reliance, as it utilizes what's available within the family's own resources.

Therefore, option B is the only one that directly contradicts the definition of self-reliance presented in the passage.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e tlhalosang sentle tsela ya go lema?,"The correct answer is **A: Ke tsamaiso yotlhe ya dijo tse di jetsweng.**

Here's why:

* The text defines ""lema"" as the entire system of acquiring food, including farming, gathering, and other sustainable practices. Option A directly reflects this broad definition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E dirisa ditsela tse di sa tlwaelegang go godisa dijalo (It uses unusual methods to obtain food):** While some subsistence practices might be unusual, the definition focuses on the overall *system*, not specific methods.
* **C: E letlelela balemi go abelana ka dijalo tsa bone mo kgaolong ya bone (It encourages people to share their food within their community):** Sharing is *part* of subsistence, but the definition is much broader than just sharing.
* **D: E santse e dirisiwa ke balimi mo dinageng tse dingwe (It has been used by farmers in other countries):**  While subsistence farming *does* exist in other countries, the text isn't specifically discussing farming; it's about the overall *system* of acquiring food.



"
Go etela museamo go wela mo karolong efe ya go ja nala?,"The correct answer is **C: Bojanala jwa setso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fa maikaelelo a moeti segolobogolo e le go etela lefelo lengwe go ka itse ka ditso le setso, mofuta o wa bojanala o itsege e le 'bojanala jwa setso'."" (If a tourist is interested in learning about the culture and customs of a place, the type of tourism is known as 'cultural tourism'.)

Visiting a museum is directly related to learning about the culture and customs of a place, therefore it falls under the category of cultural tourism (bojanala jwa setso).
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se ka tlang pele mo baeng ba tsa go iketla?","The correct answer is **B: Go ikhutsa mo ditirong tsa bona letsatsi le letsatsi.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fa ke fa batho ba etelang lefelo le le farologanyeng le botshelo ba letsatsi le letsatsi go iketla le go ikhutsa mowa."" (When people visit a different place and daily life, they tend to immerse themselves in the spirit.)  This directly supports the idea that experiencing the daily routines and customs is a key part of preparing for and appreciating a new culture.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Go itsenya mo setsong sa selegae:** While important, immersing oneself in daily life is a broader aspect of cultural preparation.
*   **C: Go bona matshwao a naga a a botlhokwa:**  Important for understanding the environment, but not the primary focus of the passage regarding cultural preparation.
*   **D: Go tlhaloganya hisitori ya lefelo:** History is useful, but the passage emphasizes the *experience* of daily life and customs as a way to connect with the ""spirit"" of a place.

Therefore, the passage prioritizes immersing oneself in the daily routines and customs of a place to truly experience its culture.
"
Se se builweng mo serapeng jaaka sengwe se se thusitseng go fokotsa go fetola poifo mo teng ga kereke ya selegae?,"The correct answer is **A: Go gopola moo go nnileng le katlego gone mo boitshwarong jwa kgwebo (Recognizing where there has been success in entrepreneurial endeavors).**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fa ntse a sekaseka katlego e bile o nna keletlhoko ka ditlholego, motho ka nosi le batho botlhe ba ba tsayang karolo, ba lemoga thata boleng, maitlhomo, le maatla a setheo."" (When he examines success and is a mentor to startups, he and all those participating notice the difficulty of life, dignity, and strength of the tribe.)

Later, it mentions that stories of entrepreneurial success have reduced the resistance to change. This implies that showcasing successful ventures (entrepreneurial endeavors) helps people see positive change and adapt to new directions.

Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the text as a means to reduce resistance to change in the church. While understanding history (D) and the organization's strengths (B & C) *could* contribute, the text specifically highlights the impact of recognizing success in entrepreneurial activities.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, go tlhaloganya hisistori ya botho go ka thusa ka eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go fokotsa letshogo la go fetoga (To reduce the fear of change).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dipolelo tse di ntseng jaana tsa katlego di fokoditse letshogo la diphetogo, ebile di tsetsekeletso ya go bona diphetogo mo nakong e e seng kgakala."" (These current words of comfort have reduced the fear of change, and they have prevented seeing changes at unexpected times.)

The passage also discusses how understanding human history helps people accept changes and new directives from religious communities. Therefore, reducing the fear of change is the most direct benefit highlighted in the text.

The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

*   **B: Go thatafatsa boleng (To improve well-being):** While related, the passage focuses more specifically on the fear of change.
*   **C: Gore o kgone go nna mo mokgatlhong (To be able to be in an organization):** The passage doesn't explicitly link historical understanding to organizational skills.
*   **D: Go tokafatsa mekgwa ya kgwebo (To standardize business practices):** The passage is not related to business practices.



"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a tlhalosang a a latelang a tlhalosang sentle ditsela tsa morago ga gompieno tsa go ithuta?,"The best answer is **A: Maitemogelo a mangwe a go ithuta a tswela mosola go nale a mangwe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that learning happens through the interaction between the learner and the knowledge.** It highlights various ways this interaction can occur: learning from experience, teaching others, using visual aids, and engaging with media.
* **Option A directly reflects this idea of multiple learning paths.**  The passage explicitly states ""Ga go tsela epe e e nosi e e leng yone fela e e dirisiwang go ithuta. Tota ebile, ga go na selo se le sosi se go ka tweng ke sone fela se se siametseng go ka ithutiwa."" (There's no single path used for learning. Rather, there's no one thing that can be considered the only way to learn).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Go ithuta go tshwanetse go tlhoma mogopolo mo dilong tse re dumelang gore re tlile go itemogela.** (Learning should focus on things we feel we are capable of). This is too restrictive.  The passage implies learning can involve pushing beyond current capabilities.
* **C: Ditsela tse dingwe tsa go ithuta di botoka go nale tse dingwe.** (Other learning methods are useless with some). This is too absolute and doesn't align with the passage's inclusive view of learning approaches.
* **D: Ga gona ditsela tsa botlhokwa mo go ithuteng.** (There are no important methods for learning). This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.



Therefore, option A accurately encapsulates the core message of the passage regarding the diversity and varied nature of learning pathways.



"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a tlhalosang a a latelang e bontshang sentle ditsela tsa morago ga gompieno tsa go ithuta?,"The correct answer is **C: Maitemogelo a go ithuta a ikaegile ka moithuti le kitso e a e abetsweng.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that learning happens through the interaction between the learner and the knowledge.** It explicitly states, ""Thutego e diragala mo maitemogelong gareng ga moithuti le kitso e e teng.""
* **The examples provided (teaching others, using diagrams, watching TV, etc.) all highlight the learner's active role in acquiring knowledge.**  The learner isn't passively receiving information; they are engaging with it.
* **Option C directly reflects this active and learner-centered approach to learning.**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go nale ditsela tse dintsi tsa go ithuta tshedimosetso (There are many ways to learn knowledge)** - While true, it doesn't capture *how* learning effectively happens.
* **B: Maitemogelo a mangwe a go ithuta a tshwanetse go beelwa kwa pele go nale a mangwe (Some learning examples should be learned before others)** -  This focuses on sequencing, not the core learning process itself.
* **D: Kitso e re se kitlang re e dirisa le yone go santse go le botlhokwa go e ithuta (The knowledge we have we use it to learn it)** - This statement is convoluted and doesn't accurately reflect the passage's main point. It suggests knowledge is used to learn knowledge, rather than the learner actively engaging with knowledge.

"Morago ga go tsoga ka bomo ka nako ya gale ya go robala, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka amang go tsamaiso ya go kgoreletsa boroko?","The correct answer is **C: Go tima alamo e e gaufi le bolao mme o bo o ya go thulamela metsotso e le masome mabedi morago ga moo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes sleep paralysis and how to manage it.** The passage states that waking up during sleep paralysis and being unable to move can be frightening.
* **Option C aligns with the recommended action for sleep paralysis.**  The passage implies that a gentle and non-jarring way to regain control is best. Waking up, getting out of bed, and then *quietly* getting up and moving (like walking to the bathroom) after a few minutes is the suggested approach. This helps to break the paralysis without a sudden shock.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go bala ura le halofo pele ga go boela borokong (Reading for an hour and a half before returning to bed)** - While good sleep hygiene is important, this doesn't address the *current* situation of sleep paralysis.
* **B: Go ya ntlwaneng mme o bo o boela bolaong (Going to the bathroom and then returning to sleep)** -  This is a valid action *after* regaining some control, but not the immediate recommended step.  Going to the bathroom could potentially startle someone who is still in a state of paralysis.
* **D: Go tsogela go nwa metsi go tswa mo botlolong e e gaufi le bolao (Getting up to drink water from a nearby water bottle)** - This could be a little too sudden and potentially startling, which is not ideal during sleep paralysis.



Therefore, **C** is the best and most appropriate answer based on the information in the passage.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e seng tlhaloso e e tshwanetseng ya go kgoreletsega ga boroko?,"The correct answer is **D: Morago ga go tsoga, mokgele ke go robala mo diureng tse pedi (After getting up, the person sleeps for two hours)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that sleep paralysis is characterized by being awake but unable to move for a short period (10-60 seconds).** It does *not* mention sleeping for two hours after waking up.

Let's look at why the other options *are* valid descriptions of sleep paralysis according to the text:

* **A: E ka nna ka ntlha ya motsamao wa mmele (It can be due to a bodily malfunction):** The passage implies a bodily malfunction by mentioning the possibility of a nerve in the spine being pinched.
* **B: Mokgele ke gore ke seka ka tsoga gotlhelele (The person is unable to move):**  This is a core symptom of sleep paralysis, directly stated in the passage.
* **C: Tsamaiso e diragala nako ya fa o ntse o robetse (The process occurs while the person is still waking up):** The passage clearly states that it happens during the transition between sleep and wakefulness.



Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the provided information.



"
"Fa boboko bo ntse bo leka go lora ka tsela e e utlwalang gantsi, ke eng se se oketsegang?","The correct answer is **A: Palo ya maemo a REM (Number of REM episodes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that when you try to fall asleep, your brain often activates, and you might experience vivid dreams. This activation is linked to REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep.  The passage then explains that the difficulty falling back asleep often stems from a continued brain activity and dreaming.  Therefore, the increase in the number of REM episodes is the most likely occurrence.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Dikgato tsa maatla (Muscle twitches):** While muscle twitches *can* occur during sleep, they aren't the primary issue described in the passage regarding difficulty falling back asleep.
*   **C: Boleele jwa boemo jwa go fola (Increased body temperature):** Body temperature normally decreases during sleep, so an *increase* is counterintuitive.
*   **D: Nako mogare ga maemo a REM (Duration of REM episodes):** While the *length* of REM episodes can vary, the passage focuses on the *frequency* of these episodes – how often they occur.

The passage explicitly states: ""Re re ka o sa robale boroko jo bo kwa teng bosigo bongwe le bongwe, seemo seno sa fa o itemogela boroko jwa mmatota mme o mmele wa ga go o itharabologelwa se direga sewelo thata mo e nnang bothata.""  This translates to: ""We say you might not sleep soundly throughout the night, this position where you experience nightmares and your body is not relaxed can cause problems.""  It then links this to difficulties waking up.

The passage further mentions that frequent awakenings are associated with difficulties falling back asleep and feeling rested.  The reason for these frequent awakenings is explained as a disruption of sleep cycles, specifically REM sleep.  Therefore, a decrease in REM sleep throughout the night would lead to more frequent awakenings and difficulty with restful sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go fokotsega ga nako mo gare ga maemo a REM (Decreased time within REM sleep stages):** While a decrease in time *within* REM is related, the passage focuses more on the *frequency* of REM sleep being disrupted, not just the duration within each REM stage.
* **C: Go ikaega ka go lora (Independent sleep):** The passage doesn't discuss the concept of independent sleep.
* **D: Go oketsega ga REM bosigo bongwe le bongwe (Increased REM sleep throughout the night):**  The passage directly states that a disruption of sleep cycles, including REM, is problematic.  Increased REM sleep would not explain the difficulties described.

"Go ya ka serapa, ditlhopha tse di tlwaelegileng le tse e seng tsa mmatota di tshwana jang?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlhopha tseno ka bobedi di na le maemo a a farologaneng a go itaola mo ditirong tsa letsatsi le letsatsi.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditlhopha tse di mo maranyaneng di tshwerwa ka seemo se se ko godimo sa ditsholofelo, fela jaaka ditlhopha tse di tlwaelesegileng mme dipharologanyo tsone di teng.""  This directly translates to: ""Small teams are called at the same level as regular teams, and they have the same functions.""

Option B accurately reflects this.  Both types of teams (regular and virtual/small) operate at the same level and have similar roles within the organization.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a malebana le ditlhopha tsa mmatota le tse e seng tsa boammaaruri?","The correct answer is **A: Gantsi ditlhopha tse di tlwaelegileng di na le maemo a a kwa godimo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ditlhopha tse di mo maranyaneng di tshwerwa ka seemo se se ko godimo sa ditsholofelo, fela jaaka ditlhopha tse di tlwaelesegileng mme dipharologanyo tsone di teng."" (Virtual teams are termed as being above the hierarchy, just like regular teams with their own metrics.)
* **The passage also defines ""setlhopha se se sa bonaleng"" (virtual team):** ""Go ya ka larson le LaFasto, 1889, p109, bolengteng ba ”setlhopha se se sa bonaleng” sa mmatota ke karolo ya virtual team."" (According to Larson and LaFasto, 1889, p109, the performance of a virtual team is a part of a virtual team.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditlhopha tse e seng tsa boammaruri gantsi ke tsone tse di kopanang le ditlhopha tse di tlwaelegileng:** The passage contrasts virtual teams (sometimes called ""die seng tsa boammaruri"" or ""unusual"") with regular teams. It doesn't say they are *combined*.
* **C: Ditlhopha tse di tlwaelegileng ga di na taolo e e kalo go na le tse e seng tsa boammaruri:**  The passage says virtual teams are *above* the hierarchy, not that regular teams have *more* control.
* **D: Dinako tse di farologaneng di ka solegela molemo ditlhopha tse e seng tsa boammaruri:** The passage doesn't mention the benefits of virtual teams at all.



Therefore, option A accurately reflects the passage's description of virtual teams and their hierarchical position compared to regular teams.

Ke efe mo go tse di latelang se se sa amaneng le dikgopolo tsa diteng?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikeletso tse disha tse di diragalang fa motho a setse a godile (New achievements that occur when a person has matured)**.

Here's why:

* The text focuses on theories about *what motivates people* and *what drives their behavior*. It specifically mentions needs, desires, and how the environment impacts actions.

Let's break down why the other options *are* related:

* **B: Kafa tikologo ya motho e amang ditiro tsa gagwe ka teng (How a person's environment affects their actions):** This directly aligns with the text's emphasis on the environment impacting behavior.
* **C: Ditlhokagalo tse di mo teng (Existing needs):** The text mentions that people have needs that evolve as they grow, which is the foundation of theories like Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.
* **D: Go tlhaloganya se batho ba se ratang (Understanding what people want):** This is a core component of motivation theories, as the text states people are driven by things they desire.

**Option A** is about achievements that happen after someone has already ""matured"" – it doesn't directly relate to the fundamental drives and motivations explored in the text's description of motivation theories. It's more about outcomes of maturity than the processes of motivation.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa akarediweng mo molaong wa boraro?,"The correct answer is **A: Go dira motheo wa gore motho a ka nna a bewa kae (To define where a person can be born)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the third law of thermodynamics regarding entropy and the natural tendency of systems to move towards disorder. It focuses on how energy is distributed in a system and the likelihood of finding it in a particular state. The key elements of this law, as described, are:

* **B: Go bopa botshelo le maatla mo setshwantshong (To build life and energy in the system):** This aligns with the natural tendency of energy to spread out and create complexity (like life) within a system.
* **C: Go dira gore motho a nne mo lefelong le le rileng le le molemo (To make it possible for a person to be in the most favorable location):** This relates to the concept of entropy and equilibrium. Systems naturally tend towards a state of maximum entropy, but life (and organisms) actively work to maintain order and complexity, often in locations that are thermodynamically favorable.
* **D: Go tlhoma thulaganyo mo setshwantshong (To determine quantity in the system):**  This relates to the distribution and availability of energy and matter within the system, which are crucial aspects of thermodynamics.

Option A, ""Go dira motheo wa gore motho a ka nna a bewa kae,"" is not a core element of the third law of thermodynamics. While birthplace *can* influence a person's life, the law doesn't specify or dictate where a person *can* be born.  It's about the behavior of energy and matter within a system, not about the possibilities of individual existence.

Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa tlhaloseng popego ya ditshwantsho tsa dimilimitara tse 35?,"The correct answer is **C: E na le selekanyo se se farologaneng le sa dipopego tse dingwe tse di tlwaelesegileng.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sebopego sa 35mm tota tota, se ka tsela nngwe se tlhakanyang tlhogo, ke sa bophara jwa 36mm ka boleele jwa 24mm. Karoganyo ya dikarolwana tsa sebopego seno (e e aroganngwang ka lesome-le-bobedi go fitlhelela karoganyo ya nomore e feletseng) ka gone e bolelwa fa e le 3:2.  **Dikarolwana tsa sebopego seno di fana ka selekanyo se se farologaneng sa karoganyo, le sa dipopego tse dingwe tse di tlwaelesegileng.**""

* **Option C directly reflects this statement.**  The passage highlights that the 35mm format has a unique aspect – its aspect ratio (3:2) – which distinguishes it from many standard formats (like APS and other digital formats).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E santse e dirwa:**  This is a general statement and doesn't explain something *unusual* about the 35mm format. The passage does mention it was used in early digital cameras.
* **B: ""E ne ya dirisiwa ke dipopego tsa dikapaditshwantsho tsa maranyane a """"digital"""" ""**: While the passage mentions digital cameras, it's not the *unusual* aspect that's being discussed.
* **D: Ke poego e e tlwaelesegileng thata mo lefatsheng:**  The passage emphasizes that 35mm *isn't* a standard or commonplace format; it has a distinct aspect ratio.

"Go ya ka serapa, fa baetsi ba dilense ba ntse ba tokafatsa boleng jwa dilense tsa bone, dilense tsa go atolosa dilo di tokafetse jang?","The correct answer is **C: Di kgona go tsaya ditshwantsho ka tsela e e tshwanang le ya dilense tse di nang le lobelo lo lo tlhomameng lwa go tlhoma lense.**

Here's why:

The passage states that high-index lenses are difficult to manufacture with the same quality as conventional lenses. The reason given is that their lower refractive index makes it difficult to achieve the same optical quality. However, the passage also mentions that manufacturers have overcome this challenge by using advanced molding techniques to achieve comparable optical quality.

Option C directly reflects this point:  high-index lenses can create images in a similar way to lenses with high-quality, thinner designs. This implies advancements in manufacturing techniques to compensate for the refractive index difference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di na le lobelo lo lo kwa godimo lwa dilense:** While true they have a higher index, this doesn't explain *how* they achieve comparable optical quality.
* **B: Go motlhofo go di dirisa fa maemo a lesedi a le kwa tlase:** The passage states that the lower thickness can be a problem in low-light conditions when using non-prescription high-index lenses. This option contradicts the passage.
* **D: Di na le bo tlhoma leitlho jo bo kwa tlase go na le jwa dilense tse dikgolo:** The passage indicates the refractive index is the issue, not necessarily the lens's thickness.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng, ke leng go ka nnang molemo go dirisa lense e e gogelang dilo kwa pele go na le dilense tse ditlwaelegileng?","The correct answer is **C: Fa o sa batle go dirisa folaše mo maemong a a lefifi.**

Here's why:

The passage states that high-index lenses are thinner at the bottom. This makes them problematic to use in dim lighting situations without using frames. Therefore, someone who *doesn't want to use frames* in low light would benefit from high-index lenses because their thinness minimizes the frame's impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fa e le gore go botlhokwa thata gore o nne le phatlha e kgolo:** The passage doesn't mention anything about needing a large frame.
* **B: Fa e le gore o batla go dirisa dilense tse dinnye:** While high-index lenses *are* thinner, the primary advantage mentioned isn't just thinness itself, but the ability to use them without frames.
* **D: Fa e le gore o batlana le lefelo le le raraaneng go feta:** The passage focuses on optical performance and thinness, not aesthetics.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e sa tseweng e le e e tlhalosang sentle Masaitseweng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go gatelelwa thata go nna le kagiso le boitumelo mo mogopolong** (It is difficult to have peace and contentment in the world).

Here's why:

The passage describes Masaitseweng as a belief system focused on finding meaning, purpose, and connection with the divine (God, the true spirit, or God of gods). It highlights that followers seek guidance and models for living a virtuous life. 

Option A directly contradicts this. Masaitseweng isn't about the difficulty of finding peace and contentment *in the world*. It's about finding that peace and contentment *through* a connection with the divine and a virtuous life, *despite* the difficulties of the world.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

* **B: Balatedi ba Masaitseweng ba batla go itse boammaaruri jwa semoya** (Followers of Masaitseweng want to know spiritual truths): This aligns with the passage's emphasis on seeking meaning and guidance.
* **C: Balatedi ba Masaitseweng ba ka nna ba dirisa mekgwa e e tla ba thusang go tlhaloganya dilo tsa bomodiano** (Followers of Masaitseweng can use methods to help them understand spiritual things): The passage mentions followers using models and guidance.
* **D: Tsela e go gatelelwang thata ka yone gore motho a nne le maitemogelo a a tlhamaletseng e tshwana le mefuta e mengwe ya bodumedi le kobamelo** (The way it is often difficult for a person to have virtuous models is similar to other forms of faith and belief): The passage directly states that finding virtuous models is a key aspect of Masaitseweng.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that doesn't accurately reflect the information provided in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e seng karolo ya dithuto tsa Masaitseweng?","The correct answer is **C: Go gatelela boemo jo bo itumedisang jwa mogopolo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the core of Christian faith as seeking understanding, relationship, and knowledge of God.** Options A, B, and D all align with this.  Seeking to understand God, using examples to learn, and desiring to know God are all central to the tenets of Christianity, according to the passage.
* **Option C, ""Go gatelela boemo jo bo itumedisang jwa mogopolo"" (Avoiding an elevated position of success), is NOT a core tenet of Christian faith as presented.**  The passage focuses on spiritual growth and humility, not on avoiding success.  In fact, it's often seen as acceptable to even be successful *while* maintaining faith and humility.

Therefore, the passage doesn't advocate for avoiding success; it advocates for maintaining a spiritual perspective regardless of success.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o ka tswang a simolotse setšhaba sa temothuo?","The correct answer is **C: Ba-Maori ba ba tswang kwa Polynesia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""go ne go dumelwa fa baagi ba ntlha ba naga ya New Zealand e ne e le morafe wa ba Maori... go ne go na le kakanyo ya go re batho ba letso la Maori ba dule go tswa mo Polynesia ba leba New Zealand ba bo ba mo tsaya mo morafeng wa Moriori, ba simolola tsamaiso ya temo-thuo.""

This directly indicates that the initial settlers of New Zealand were the Maori, who came from Polynesia and established the first culture. While the passage discusses the Moriori later, it clearly identifies the Maori as the originators of the culture.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, setlhopha se se neng se tsoma di-moas e ne e le baagi ba ntlha ba lefelo lefe?","The correct answer is **A: Naga**.

The passage states: ""Go ne go dumelwa fa baagi ba ntlha ba naga ya New Zealand e ne e le morafe wa ba Maori..."" which translates to ""It was believed that the original inhabitants of the country of New Zealand were the Maori people...""
"
Ke mo seemong sefe se go dirisa mokgwa wa Pureland wa go dira di-origami go ka solegelang yo o menang molemo?,"The correct answer is **C: Foldara e dira origami e e tlhokang go menwa go tswa kwa morago.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Pureland origami is designed to be easier to learn for beginners, especially when learning with children and educators.  A key characteristic of Pureland origami is that the folds are designed so that the *inside* of the paper is always visible. This means many folds are made *from the inside out*, which is a crucial aspect of the Pureland method and would be most beneficial to a beginner.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Foldara e rata go menola dilo di le dintsi ka nako e le nngwe:**  While complexity is relative, the focus of Pureland origami is simplicity and clarity, not necessarily attempting to create highly intricate models in a single step.
* **B: Foldara eno e na le bokgoni jo bo kwa godimo jwa go kgweetsa:**  This isn't mentioned in the passage and isn't a characteristic of Pureland origami.
* **D: Foldara e e lekile gangwe kgotsa gabedi pele ga foo:** The point of Pureland origami is its ease of learning, making prior experience not a necessity.



Therefore, the ability to easily see the inside of the paper and make folds from the inside out makes option C the most appropriate."
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa tlhalosang sentle origami ya Pureland?,"The correct answer is **A: E diretswe dipampiri tse di mennweng gantsi.**

Here's why:

The provided text states that Pureland origami uses *thin* paper to make the folds crisp and well-defined. Option A says it uses *thick* paper, which directly contradicts the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the text:

* **B: Mokgwa ono ga o akaretse go menoga go go sa siamang:** The text implies a precise folding method, suggesting no irregular unfolding.
* **C: Memeno e tshwanetse go nna e tlhamaletse mo mafelong:**  This aligns perfectly with the text's emphasis on crisp, well-defined folds.
* **D: Ke mokgwa o o molemo mo difoldareng tse di nang le bokgoni jo bo lekanyeditsweng jwa go kgweetsa:**  The text mentions the goal of making it easier for learners to understand, implying a structured approach that could be beneficial for creating folds with controlled creases.



Therefore, the only option that *doesn't* align with the text is **A**.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke lefelo lefe le le sa amaneng le Setso sa Mokgatšha wa Indus?","The correct answer is **B: Noka ya Sarasvati**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while some scholars suggest a civilization existed in the Sarasvati Valley, it's ""not well established.""
* The Indus Valley Civilization is explicitly linked to sites like Harappa and areas in northwest India and Afghanistan.
* Therefore, the Sarasvati Valley, lacking strong evidence of a civilization equivalent to the Indus Valley Civilization, is the answer.
"
Ke efe ya maina a a latelang e e sa umakiweng e le leina le le ka tswang le dirisitswe go bitsa Bronze Age e go buiwang ka yone mo serapeng?,"The correct answer is **C: Setšhaba sa Noka ya Indus**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Indus Valley Civilization is well-known for its finds at sites of the **Nokian Indus** culture.
* While ""Setšhaba sa Ba-Harappan"" (Harappan People) and ""Setšhaba sa Indus-Sarasvati"" are related and sometimes used, they are not the primary, accepted name mentioned in the passage.
* ""Setšhaba sa Mokgatšha wa Indus"" (Indus Settlement People) is not mentioned at all in the passage.

Therefore, the option that is *not* mentioned as a name used to refer to the Bronze Age civilization described is ""Setšhaba sa Noka ya Indus.""  The passage highlights the importance of the **Nokian Indus** culture in identifying this civilization.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tla re solegelang molemo mo isagweng?","The correct answer is **A: Ba dirisane mmogo le ba bangwe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lefufa le bogagapa di tla tlhola di na le rona ebile ke mokgwa wa go dirisana go re fa bontsi bo bona dipoelo go tla tlhola go na le mo go gontsi go gatjwa mo nakong e khutshwane ka tsela ya bo gagapa."" (Wealth and poverty will come with us and it is a way of interacting that will show that many of its benefits will occur in times of hardship in a self-serving way.)
* **The passage also suggests:** ""Gongwe, bontsi jwa batho bo tla lemoga fa go tla ba tswela mosola fa nako e ntse e ya go re ba dirisane mmogo le ba bangwe."" (Perhaps, many people will realize that they will be swept away if they interact with others.)

This indicates that cooperation and interacting with others will be beneficial, especially during difficult times.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go baya dilo tse motho a di kgatlhegelang kwa pele** (Putting things that people are attached to in front): This is irrelevant to the passage's main point about wealth, poverty, and cooperation.
* **C: Go gatelela gore ke eng se se tla solegelang ba le mmalwa molemo go feta bontsi** (Preventing what will benefit the few more than the many):  While ethical, this isn't the *most* directly supported answer based on the passage. The passage emphasizes the *interaction* with others, not just preventing unequal benefits.
* **D: Go lemoga bopelotshetlha go ka nna molemo** (Recognizing selfishness can be beneficial): The passage implies selfishness leads to being ""swept away"" and doesn't portray it as beneficial.



Therefore, **A: Ba dirisane mmogo le ba bangwe** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Go ya ka temana e, ke eng se motho a ka se bayang kwa pele fa a batla maduo a a bogadi bo gaufi?","The correct answer is **A: Go sa nne pelotshetlha (Not being shy/confident)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that people will be hesitant to interact due to fear of embarrassment.** Therefore, overcoming shyness is crucial to initiating romantic connections.
* While the other options might play a role later, being confident and not shy is the *initial* step to approaching someone.  Being collaborative, working together, or being romantic are subsequent actions.
* The passage mentions that many people will feel awkward interacting with others, and that overcoming that awkwardness is key. Confidence helps to negate that feeling.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a duelela karolo e kgolo ya ditshenyegelo tsa ntwa?","The correct answer is **D: Batho ba Philippines**.

The passage states: ""...ba ne ba patelesega go duela puso ya bokoloniale ya U.S. makgetho go duelela karolo e kgolo ya ditshenyegelo le merokotso ya ditheko tsa matlo tse di neng di le mo maroding a puso ya Philippine go dirisiwa dibanka tsa Wall Street.""

This means the Filipino people resisted the US colonial ambitions and fought to prevent the exploitation of their resources by Wall Street banks. Therefore, they were the ones who fought to oppose the bulk of the exploitation.
"
Ke nako efe e e neng ya tla pele ga motlha wa Ba-Templar?,"The correct answer is **B: Lekgolo la bo12 la dingwaga (12th Century)**.

The text states that the High Middle Ages, the period when the Knights Templar existed, lasted from AD 1000-1300. Therefore, the 12th century falls within the timeframe of their existence and is the time when they first became known.
"
Ke nako efe e e neng ya latela motlha wa Ba-Templar?,"The correct answer is **A: Bofelo jwa Metlha ya Bogare (High Middle Ages)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nako e ditiragalo di diragetse ka yona e bidiwa """"High Middle Ages"""" - nako ya ditso tsa Uropa, a makgolo a fetileng a dingwaga (AD 1000-1300)."" which translates to ""The period in which the events took place was called the """"High Middle Ages"""" - a large period of European history, spanning many years (AD 1000-1300).""

Therefore, the High Middle Ages followed the rise of the Templars.
"
Ke kalafi efe kgotsa karo e go sa umakiweng gore e ne e dirisiwa ke dingaka le dingaka tse di arang mo motlheng wa Mmusomogolo wa Roma?,"The correct answer is **A: Go alafa bolwetse jwa go ngomoga pelo morago ga tiragalo e e utlwisang botlhoko ka diritibatsi tse di farologaneng tse di robatsang.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Roman doctors used various drugs, including morphine and scopolamine, to treat ailments like **""dintho tse di kekelang ga mmogo""** which translates to something like ""conditions related to the stomach.""  The passage also mentions using these drugs to prevent blood loss and treat gangrene.  While options B, C, and D are all things the Romans *did* (using plants for scopolamine, clamping blood vessels, and treating gangrene), option A best reflects the *specific* ailment mentioned in connection with the use of these drugs: ailments related to the stomach (which could include things like peptic ulcers or gastritis).



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa amaneng le kgatelopele e e neng ya dirwa mo go tsa kalafi ka nako ya Mmusomogolo wa Roma?","The correct answer is **B: Leano le le bogale la sesole la Mmusomogolo**.

Here's why:

* **A: Go tlhomiwa ga Setlhopha sa Kalafi (The establishment of medical corps):** The text explicitly states that Emperor Augustus established the first Roman medical corps.
* **C: Go tlhomiwa ga dikokelo tsa go ithutela bongaka (The establishment of medical training):** The text mentions that doctors were highly respected and had a scientific approach, implying a level of medical training.
* **D: Go thapiwa ga dingaka ke Mmusimogolo (Emperors providing medicine):** The text states that emperors like Augustus funded the medical corps and medicine.
* **B: Leano le le bogale la sesole la Mmusomogolo (The emperor's lavish lifestyle):** While Roman emperors were known for their lavish lifestyles, this is *not* mentioned in the provided text about Roman medicine.  It's unrelated to the medical practices discussed.



Therefore, the only option that doesn't align with the information provided in the text is the emperor's lavish lifestyle.



"
Bokgoni jwa go bona bo ikaegile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikarolo tsa mmele tse di dirang gore motho a bone**.

The passage clearly states that the ability to see is due to specific body parts. Options B, C, and D are not mentioned in the text as related to the ability to see.
"
Go farologana ga popego ya leitlho ga ditshedi go ikaegile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ditlhokego tsa setshedi (Rods of the retina)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the retina is made up of many layers of cells. These layers contain **rods**, which are responsible for vision in low light conditions (seeing in dim light or at night). The passage emphasizes that the rods have the ability to be flexible, meaning they can adapt to the amount of light available and respond accordingly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tshwarega ga lekhubu (Shape of the pupil):**  The pupil controls the amount of light entering the eye, but the flexibility of the rods is a separate function.
*   **C: Boleng jwa go nna bogale (Health of the eye):** While eye health is important for vision, the passage specifically focuses on the *function* of the rods and how their flexibility contributes to vision.
*   **D: Go raraana ga setshedi (Flexibility of the lens):** The lens focuses light, and its flexibility is important for focusing at different distances, but it's not directly related to the rods' ability to adapt to light levels.

Therefore, the passage directly links the rods' flexibility to **ditlhokego tsa setshedi (rods of the retina)**."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a malebana le Sikh a a sa tlhalosang bodumedi jono sentle?","The correct answer is **A: Bo-Sikh bo simologile ka go kgaogana ga makoko mo dingwaong tsa Bahindu.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bo-Sikh ke tumelo e e tswang kwa nageng ya seka-kontinente ya India. E simologile kwa kgaolong ya Punjab mo lekgolong la bo-15 la dingwaga go tswa mo kgaoganong ya makoko mo setsong sa ba-Hindu.""

The question asks which option *doesn't* describe Sikhism positively. While the passage acknowledges its roots in Hinduism, phrasing it as ""simologile ka go kgaogana ga makoko mo dingwaong tsa Bahindu"" can be interpreted as downplaying its unique identity and potentially implying dependence on Hinduism, which isn't necessarily a positive portrayal.

Let's look at why the other options *are* positive descriptions:

*   **B: Boruti ke karolo e e botlhokwa ya Ba-Sikh:** The passage explicitly states this.
*   **C: Go ne go na le baruti ba le robongwe ba ba neng ba latela mosimolodi wa bodumedi jono e bong Guru Nanak:** This highlights the lineage and continued guidance within Sikhism.
*   **D: Dingwao dingwe tsa Sikh di simologile mo Bohindu:** The passage says ""Dingwao dingwe tsa Sikh di simologile mo Bohindu,"" which isn't inherently negative. It acknowledges the historical connection.

Therefore, option A is the *least* positive description and is the best answer to the question."
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tsewang e le karolo ya konokono ya tumelo ya Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Kgopolo ya gore go na le moruti (The belief that there is a teacher/guru)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Tumelo e ne e simolotswe ke Guru Nanak (1469-1539) ka paka ya bolesome le botlhano. E be a salwa morago ke ke diguru tse dingwe tse di borobabongwe.""  This directly indicates the importance of a teacher (Guru) in Sikhism.
* The text also mentions that the Guru is a crucial part of all Indian spiritual traditions.
* Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the text. While Sikhism is rooted in Hinduism, it's described as distinct. The text doesn't mention rejecting other Indian faiths or the importance of speaking Punjabi.

"Go ya ka serapa, bana ba ba sa kgoneng go tlhoma mogopolo ba ka nna ba thatafalelwa ke go tlhoma mogopolo mo go eng?","The correct answer is **A: Tiro ya sekolo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bana ba ba nang le bolwetse jwa ADD ba na le bothata ja go dira tiro ya sekolo..."" (Children with ADD have difficulty doing schoolwork...).
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke ka ntlha yang fa bana ba ba sa kgoneng go tlhoma mogopolo ba rata go dira dilo tse di kotsi?","The correct answer is **A: Go fokotsa go sa dire dilo ka tsela e e feteletseng**.

Here's why:

The text states that children with ADD have difficulty with schoolwork and may struggle with things they enjoy, like staying still or paying attention to favorite activities. It also mentions that they might not use written cues.  The text directly links this difficulty focusing to engaging in risky behaviors as a way to release energy.  Therefore, reducing the amount of unstructured activities (i.e., things they might do to release energy) is the logical approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go ba thusa gore ba nne le kamano le balekane ba bone:** While social skills are important for children with ADD, the text directly links risky behaviors to difficulty focusing. This option doesn't directly address that connection.
* **C: Gore batsadi ba bone ba ba ele tlhoko:**  The text doesn't suggest that parents need to feel guilty. It focuses on the challenges children with ADD face.
* **D: Go tlhotlheletsa boboko jwa bone:** This is not a helpful or appropriate response and goes against the principles of supporting a child with ADD. It also doesn't directly address the connection between difficulty focusing and risky behaviors.

"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng, ke efe mo go tseno e e seng sekai sa go thusa ngwana go ithuta?","The correct answer is **C: Thulaganyo e e ikemetseng ya go ithuta (Independent learning system)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""Scaffolding ga se motlhale wa thuto... ke sedirisiwa se se thusang baithuti ba ba ithutang dilo tse disha..."" This means scaffolding is a *support* mechanism, not the learning itself.
* The passage then mentions various examples of scaffolding, including ""borutabana o ka kaiwa e le scaffold"" (tutoring can be scaffolding).
*  A ""Thulaganyo e e ikemetseng ya go ithuta"" (Independent learning system) implies a system that allows a student to learn on their own, without direct support.  This is the *opposite* of scaffolding, which is designed to *provide* support.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Thuto ya go simolola motshameko wa khomputara (Computer coding tutorial):**  A tutorial *could* be a form of scaffolding.
* **B: Motlhatlheledi wa SAT (SAT test administrator):**  An administrator is involved in *testing*, not learning support.
* **D: Motlhatlheledi yo monnye wa setlhopha (Individual group facilitator):** A facilitator could provide scaffolding within a group setting.



Therefore, the independent learning system is the one that *isn't* a support mechanism designed to help a student learn, making it the correct answer.

"""Ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang a a sa tlhaloseng sentle kgopolo ya """"scaffold"""" (go thusa ngwana go ithuta)?""","The best answer is **D: Di-scaffold di dirisiwa go thusa fa go simololwa go ithuta.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Scaffolding ga se motlhale wa thuto, ke sedirisiwa se se thusang baithuti ba ba ithutang dilo tse disha, di tshwana le go ithuta go dirisa sebalamakgolo kgotsa ba simolola porojeke e ntsha."" (Scaffolding is not a teacher, it is a tool that helps students learn new things, like learning to use a stapler or starting a project.)
* **Option D directly reflects this explanation.**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go thusa ngwana go ithuta go ka nna teng ka tsela ya mmatota:** While scaffolding *could* be used in a manipulative way, the passage doesn't focus on that. The primary purpose is structured assistance.
* **B: Ke thuso go na le mokgwa wa go ithuta:** This is too general.  Scaffolding is *a specific type* of support, not just any help with learning.
* **C: Gape go itsege jaaka go ithuta go go ikaegileng ka porojeke:** This is a consequence of using scaffolding, but not the *definition* of what scaffolding *is*.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke karolo efe ya MySpace e e ka thusang baithuti ba ba nang le bothata jwa go bala?","The correct answer is **C: Aterese e le nngwe ya Inthanete (Single website address)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Sebe eno ya inthanete e letlelesega bonolo ka go fana ka aterese e le nngwe ya webosate, seo se dira gore go nne bonolo go gopola ebile go nne bonolo gore baithuti ba ba nang le bothata le go dirisa khiiboto kgotsa le mopeleto ba tlanye."" (This online platform emphasizes ease of use by providing a single website address, which makes it easy to remember and easy for students who have difficulty using a keyboard or mouse to navigate.)

This ease of navigation directly helps students who struggle with reading because they can easily access the content without the added difficulty of technical navigation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Thulaganyo e e diretsweng wena (Personalized content):** While personalization *could* be helpful, the passage doesn't explicitly link it to helping students with reading difficulties.
* **B: Di-blog (Blogs):** Blogs are a feature, but the passage doesn't explain how they specifically assist struggling readers.
* **D: Difaele di le dimilione di le 54 (54 million files):** The sheer number of files isn't presented as a benefit for readers with difficulties. It's more about the platform's overall content.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e neng e se karolo ya karabo ya ga Khrushchev mo dikhuduegong tsa badiri?","The correct answer is **A: Go tlhomiwa ga Tonakgolo e ntšha (The rise of a popular leader)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while Krushchev initially sent troops to suppress the unrest, he *also* allowed for some concessions.  A key concession was allowing Wladyslaw Gomulka, a popular figure, to become the new leader. This aligns with Krushchev's overall strategy of appeasement and finding a compromise, albeit one that still maintained Communist control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go dirisa ditanka go busetsa thulaganyo (Using tanks to suppress the uprising):** The passage *says* Krushchev initially sent troops to suppress the uprising, making this an action he took *before* allowing concessions.
* **C: Go fokotsa dituelo (Reducing wages):**  The passage explicitly mentions that reducing wages was *one of the reasons* the workers were protesting.  Krushchev didn't *implement* this as a part of his response; it was the problem.
* **D: Go lemoga gore go na le dilo dingwe tse o tlhokang go di dira ka madi (Recognizing that there are other things that need to be done with money):** The passage doesn't mention Krushchev recognizing a need for other financial actions.



"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e neng e sa bake dikhuduego kwa Poland?,"The correct answer is **A: Bokomonisi (Communism)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the initial protests in Poland in 1956 were *because* of issues like food shortages, rising prices, and utility cuts. However, the protests *escalated* into a confrontation with the communist government.  Krushchev's response involved sending troops to suppress the unrest.  He *conceded* some demands, including allowing Wladyslaw Gomulka to become the new leader, but the *root cause* of the initial unrest was dissatisfaction with the communist system itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go tlhaela ga dijo (Food shortages):**  The passage mentions food shortages as a factor *leading* to the protests, but not as the *reason* the protests started.
*   **C: Go fokotsa dituelo (Utility cuts):** Same as above; utility cuts were a contributing factor, but not the main reason for the initial protests.
*   **D: Go tlhomiwa ga Wladyslaw Gomulka (The rise of Wladyslaw Gomulka):** Gomulka's rise was a *consequence* of the protests, not the reason they occurred. Krushchev conceded to his rise *after* the protests had already begun.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e neng e sa ame dikamano tsa USSR le USA?","The correct answer is **C: Dithulaganyo tsa go farologanya (Ideological differences)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that after the Second World War, ""dipharologanyo tsa ditsamaiso, metheo, le dingwao di ile tsa dire go re kutlwano ya mafatshe a e nyelele"" (ideologies, values, and languages led to the breakdown of global cooperation).  This means the fundamental differences in political and economic systems (capitalism vs. communism) were a major factor in the Cold War.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dipharologano tsa setso (Cultural differences):** While cultural differences *could* exist, the passage focuses specifically on ideological differences as the driving force behind the breakdown of cooperation.
* **B: Dikgopolo ka Jeremane (German missions):** The passage mentions Germany's role as a meeting point, but doesn't link German missions specifically to the breakdown of relations.
* **D: Dikgotlhang tse di amanang le dithulaganyo (Meetings related to treaties):** The passage mentions treaties and meetings, but the focus is on the *failure* of cooperation due to ideological differences, not on the treaties themselves.

Therefore, the passage highlights **ideological differences** as the primary reason for the Cold War.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa tlhaloseng sentle boikaelelo jwa go romela matshwao a ditshika mo mmeleng otlhe?,"The correct answer is **A: Go fokotsa kelelo ya madi (To reduce blood flow)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that sending signals through the body *maintains* good blood flow and prevents it from becoming stagnant. 
* Reducing blood flow would be the *opposite* of what the passage describes as the effect of sending signals.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Go laola kelelo ya madi (To control blood flow):**  The passage implies the signals *regulate* blood flow, not reduce it. Control is a more encompassing term than reduction.
* **C: Go dira gore mmele o nne o ritibetse (To make the body more resistant):** While improved blood flow *can* contribute to overall body health and resistance, the passage doesn't specifically say the primary purpose is to make the body resistant.
* **D: Go tila dikotsi tsa mmele tse di ka nnang tsa direga (To avoid bodily risks):** Maintaining good blood flow *does* help avoid risks, but it's not the core reason why sending signals is beneficial as described.  The passage focuses on the positive effects of signal transmission.



Therefore, reducing blood flow contradicts the central idea presented in the passage."
Ke eng se se ka fitlhelwang kwa Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikgakgamatso Tsotlhe Tse Supa**

The text explicitly states: ""Setlhaba sa Giza, kgotsa ”Mabitla a Giza” kwa Mokgatšheng wa Baswi wa Egepeto se na le diphiramiti di le mmalwa (tse mo go tsone ”Phiramiti e Kgolo” e le e kgolo go gaisa), mabitla a mannye a le mmalwa, ditempele di le mmalwa, le sefikantswe sa ”The Great Sphinx”."" This indicates that all of the listed options (pyramids, temples, and the Great Sphinx) are found on the Giza Plateau.
"
Boikaelelo jwa Phiramiti e Kgolo e ne e le bofe?,"The correct answer is **B: Go tlotla Faro**.

The passage states: ""Phiramiti e kgolo e ne e agetswe go tlotla Faro Khufu..."" (The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...).
"
Ke mang yo o ikarabelelang ka go bo re itse motho yo o neng a fisa tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Baefeso**.

The passage states: ""Baefeso ka ntlha ya kgalefo, ba ile ba itsise go re leina la Herostratus le ka motlhale seka la kwalwa mo direkotong."" (The Ephesians, out of outrage, decided that Herostratus’ name should not be recorded in the annals.) This directly indicates that the Ephesians were the ones who decided to conceal Herostratus's name.
"
Ke polelo efe e e boammaaruri malebana le go agiwa seša ga tempele ya ga Aretemise?,"The correct answer is **B: E ne ya agiwa sesha morago ga puso ya ga Alexander yo Mogolo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Alexander, jaaka kgosi, o ile a ithaopa go duelela kago sesha ya tempele, mme boithaopi jwa gagwe ga bo aka jwa dumelwa. Moragonyana, ga gore Alexander a tlhokafale, tempele e ile ya agiwa sesha kwa ngwaga ya 323 BCE."" This clearly indicates Alexander the Great wanted to rebuild it, and it was rebuilt *after* his death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go agiwa seša ga yone go ne ga duelelwa ke Alexander yo Mogolo:** While Alexander *wanted* to rebuild it, the rebuilding didn't happen during his lifetime.
* **C: Herostratus o ne a laelwa gore a duelele ditshenyegelo tsa go aga sesha:** The passage doesn't mention anything about Herostratus being tasked with rebuilding it. He was responsible for the original destruction.
* **D: E ne ya agiwa seša ka 320 B.C.E.:** The passage states it was rebuilt in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the information provided in the passage.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke leng mofuta mongwe wa ditshedi o neng wa simolola go tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi?","The correct answer is **A: Dingwaga di le dimilione di le supa tse di fetileng**.

The passage states: "" Mme le gale gongwe di-Sahelanthropus, tsone di ka tswa di ne di tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi mo e ka nang a **dingwaga tse di dimilione tse supa tse di fetileng**."" (And perhaps Sahelanthropus walked upright perhaps 6 million years ago.)
"
Ke mofuta ofe wa ditshedi tseno o ka metlha o neng o tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: "" Mme le gale gongwe di-Sahelanthropus, tsone di ka tswa di ne di tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi mo e ka nang a dingwaga tse supa tse di fitileng."" (And perhaps the Sahelanthropus, they may have walked on two legs approximately 6 million years ago).
*   The passage also mentions Australopithecus walking on two legs starting around 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago.
*   Homo erectus is mentioned as a later species that definitely walked on two legs.

Therefore, Sahelanthropus is the earliest species mentioned as potentially walking on two legs, making it the correct answer."
Ke eng se sesole sa lewatle sa Jeremane se neng se leka go se fitlhelela ka nako ya Ntwa ya Lefatshe ya WWII?,"The correct answer is **B: Go thibela Borithane go amogela batho le dithoto**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""MaAmerika a ne a leka go tsamaisa batho le didiriswa go ralala lewatle la Atlantic go thusa Britain. E ntseng le thata go tsamaisa batho le dithoto ka tshosologo.""  This directly indicates that the German U-boats were trying to *prevent* the Allies (specifically Britain) from moving people and supplies across the Atlantic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go tshwara dithoto tse di tswang kwa Borithane:** The passage doesn't say the Germans were trying to capture ships *from* Britain.
* **C: Go tsamaisa dilo go kgabaganya Atlantic:** The passage discusses stopping movement, not facilitating it.
* **D: Go thibela Amerika go amogela batho le dithoto:** While the U-boats certainly impacted American efforts, the passage focuses on Britain's supply lines as the primary target.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng, ke mang yo o neng a atlega thata mo ntweng ya sesole sa lewatle ka nako ya Letsholo la Bokone jwa Atlantic?","The correct answer is **C: Majeremane le Maesemane**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the conflict involved the Allies (led by the US and Britain) trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic, and the Germans using U-boats to *stop* those transports.  Therefore, both sides were heavily involved and had significant stakes in the outcome.  The passage doesn't explicitly say one side *won* decisively, but rather describes a struggle.

While the Allies ultimately prevailed, the passage highlights the intense and difficult nature of the naval warfare between them and the Germans. So, both were heavily engaged in the naval battle.
"
Ke eng se se neng se seyo fa Maaasiria ba ne ba simolola go dirisa bapalami ba dipitse?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikara** (Chariots).

The text explicitly states: ""Metswi e e tswang mo boreng jwa bone jo bo borai e ne kgona go phunyeletsa mo seaparong sa phemelo sa masole a ba lwang nao. **Mo e ka nnang ka 1000 B.C., ma-Asiria a ne a simolodisa sesole sa ntlha sa dipitse.** Calvary ke masole a lwanelang mo morago ga pitse. Setulo se se mo morago ga pitse se ne ise se diriwe, jaanong maAssyrian bane ba lwanela mo mokwatleng wa pitse yo o senag sepe."" This directly indicates the introduction of chariots.
"
Dintwa tse go dirisiwang kalvari mo go tsone di lowa jang?,"The correct answer is **C: Go palama pitse**.

The passage states: ""Calvary ke masole a lwanelang mo morago ga pitse. Setulo se se mo morago ga pitse se ne ise se diriwe, jaanong maAssyrian bane ba lwanela mo mokwatleng wa pitse yo o senag sepe.""  This directly indicates that the cavalry fought *on* the backs of the chariots.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mo dinaong:** The passage doesn't mention fighting on foot.
* **B: Go se na diaparo tsa ntwa:**  The passage doesn't give information about their clothing.
* **D: Ka masole a mannye:** The passage specifies they fought *with* chariots.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke kae koo o neng o ka se ka wa fitlhela moagi yo o tlwaelegileng wa Babelona gone?","The correct answer is **C: Kwa moletlong mongwe mo lolwapeng lwa tempele** (In a specific chamber within the temple complex).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that people brought offerings *to the temple*.
* It also mentions that priests would look after the offerings in *various chambers* of the temple.
* Options A and D are too specific. While offerings *could* be brought to the temple, they weren't solely confined to the temple's altar or a specific sacred chamber.
* Option B is incorrect because the passage doesn't say offerings were placed in a specific chamber of the temple's inner sanctum (the ""inner chamber"").

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that offerings were placed in one of the **chambers within the temple complex**.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tse di neng di diretswe baperesiti ka tlhamalalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Mekete**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Fa baruti bone ba ne ba leka go tlamela ditlhoko tsa medimo ka mekete..."" (Priests tried to satisfy the gods with offerings of markets...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mafelo a a boitshepo a mo teng** (Incense available): The passage mentions incense, but it's described as being offered *by the priests themselves* and isn't specified as something they used for their own benefit or directly for ritual practices.
* **C: Mekete** (Markets): This is a duplicate of option A, but is still the correct answer.
* **D: Di-ziggurat** (Ziggurats): While ziggurats were sometimes used as temple platforms, the passage focuses on what the priests *used* in their rituals, and the passage focuses on markets.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is **Mekete**.
"
Kgosi Tutankhamun o ne a tuma leng?,"The correct answer is **C: Morago ga go utololwa ga lebitla la gagwe**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Le fa go ntse jalo, go utololwa ga lebitla la gagwe ka ngwaga wa 1922 go mo dirile go re e nne motho yo o itsegeng thata."" (Even so, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a very famous person.) This indicates his fame grew *after* the discovery of his tomb.
"
Ke eng se se neng sa dira gore Kgosi Tutankhamun e nne kgosi e e itsegeng thata ya Egepeto?,"The correct answer is **A: Go ribololwa ga lebitla la gagwe (The discovery of his tomb)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Le fa go ntse jalo, go utololwa ga lebitla la gagwe ka ngwaga wa 1922 go mo dirile go re e nne motho yo o itsegeng thata."" (Even so, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a very famous person.)

While options C and D are related to the discovery, they are *results* of the tomb's discovery, not the initial reason he became famous. Option B is incorrect because the passage says he wasn't considered particularly important during his lifetime.
"
Mmoki wa Mogerika e bong Homer o ne a sa kgone go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Bua**

The passage states that Homer was a ""mogaka wa mmoki wa sefofu"" (a poet of the lyre).  Poets *sing* and *tell stories* – they **speak** or **utter** words. The other options (hear, see, travel) aren't directly related to Homer's role as a poet.
"
Ke Mogerika ofe yo o tumileng yo o itsegeng ka sengwe kwa ntle ga  dibuka?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Go ka direga go re motho yo o itsegeng thata wa setso seno ke Homer...rradipalo e bong Pythagoras, yo a itsegeng thata ka mokgwa wa gagwe o o itsegeng wa dikamano tsa matlhakore a dikhutlotharo."" (It can be said that the most important person of this nation is Homer...the mathematician Pythagoras, who was important in his own way for his work on the ratios of musical intervals.)

While Sophocles, Homer, and Aristophanes were all prominent Greek figures, the passage specifically highlights Pythagoras's importance as a mathematician.
"
Lelapa la Bahebera le ne le fetsa nako e ntsi ya lone kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwa ntle**.

The passage states: ""Bontsi jwa botshelo jwa malapa a ma-Hebero bo ne bo le kwa ntle."" This translates to ""Much of the life of the Hebrew families was outside.""
"
Ke eng se se neng se se botlhokwa thata mo lelapeng la Bahebera?,"The correct answer is **A: Tlelaemete ya bone (Their hardship/suffering)**.

The passage describes a difficult life for the Hebrews in Botswana:

*   ""ntlo e ne e se botlhokwa thata"" - homes were not very important.
*   ""Botshelo jwa malapa a ma-Hebero bo ne bo le kwa ntle"" - the lives of the Hebrew families were outside.
*   ""Basadi ba ne ba apeela mo lelwapeng"" - Women were appealing for help.
*   ""Go ne go dirisiwa mantswe go a ga matlo"" -  Words of distress were used.
*   ""Go ne go sena ko dikgwa tse di tona ko Kanana, ka jalo, dikgong di ne di rekwa ka madi a a ko godimo"" - There was a shortage of cattle in Canaan, so herds were bought with money from above.

All these points indicate hardship and suffering. The other options (stores, their house, their distress) are not the primary focus of the passage. While stores might exist, and people might desire a better house, the overwhelming theme is difficulty and lack of resources. Therefore, the hardship/suffering is the most accurate answer.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa tlhalosiweng e le pharologano fa gare ga dinaga tsa Scandinavia?,"The correct answer is **B: Lefatshe (Land)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions differences in history, culture (which includes traditions), and people among the Scandinavian countries.  It states that Greenland *was* inhabited by Eskimo people *before* the Norse arrived. This indicates a difference in *land* use and original inhabitants.  However, the passage doesn't discuss differences in the *land* itself (geography, climate, etc.) between the Scandinavian countries.

Therefore, the land is the only option not directly mentioned as a source of divergence among the Scandinavian nations in the provided text.
"
Ke mang yo o neng a nna kwa Greenland pele?,"The correct answer is **A: Merafe ya Maeskimo**.

Ke setlhopha sefe se se ka ratang go ja dijo tsa maitseboa se sena ditulo?,"The correct answer is **A: Basadi ba ba humileng ba Roma (Poor Roman women)**.

The passage states: ""Pharologanyo e nngwe e ne e le go re fa batho ba ba dikobo di dikhutshwane le basadi ba ja dijo ba ntse mo ditilong..."" which translates to ""Another account is that poor people and women used to eat while in bed..."" This indicates that poor women were the ones who ate unusual foods, including dormice, while lying down.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e neng e se karolo ya moletlo wa Baroma ba Bogologolo?,"The correct answer is **A: Baeng ba ba humanegileng ba ja mo ditulong (Wealthy people eating in tubs)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Pharologanyo e nngwe e ne e le go re fa batho ba ba dikobo di dikhutshwane le basadi ba ja dijo ba ntse mo ditilong..."" which translates to ""Another story was that the wealthy and women would eat while sitting in tubs...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sejo sa pele sa dikgopa (First course of dormice):** While dormice *were* eaten, the passage doesn't say they were the *first* course.
* **C: Banna ba ba humileng ba rapame fa ba ja (Poor men would beg while eating):** The passage doesn't mention poor men begging for food.
* **D: Sejana sa kalakuni e e besitsweng (A roasted peacock):**  The passage states that the Romans never heard of roasted peacock.



Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the text."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka se kang ya nna le diphelelo tse di nnelang ruri?","The correct answer is **B: Setso se sennye (Simple society)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Metsemegolo e tsile pele ga dichaba. Setso se se tlhabologileng se bolela go re go fetisiwa ga kitso go ya le dikokomana di le mmalwa, se se dira gore di seka tsa tsewa jaaka merafe e e feletseng.""  This translates to: ""Societies came before civilizations. A civilized society implies the transmission of knowledge through a few written records, which makes them known as complete races.""

This implies a hierarchical progression: Simple societies (setso se sennye) come before civilizations. The other options (civilization, town/city, civilized society) are all aspects *of* a civilization. Therefore, a simple society wouldn't have the characteristics of a civilization and wouldn't be considered ""complete"" in terms of recorded knowledge.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se tlang pele ga setšhaba?","The correct answer is **A: Setso se se tlhabologileng (Civilized custom/tradition)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Metsemegolo e tsile pele ga dichaba."" which translates to ""Customs came before civilizations."" and further clarifies ""Setso se se tlhabologileng se bolela go re go fetisiwa ga kitso go ya le dikokomana di le mmalwa..."" meaning ""Civilized custom/tradition implies that the transmission of knowledge took place with few artifacts..."" 

Therefore, the text indicates that **civilized customs/traditions** preceded the formation of a civilization.
"
Ke polelo efe e e seng boammaaruri ka Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **C: Molelo o ne wa senya masalela a mantsi a kago ya phemelo (The report destroyed the remains of the fortress)**.

* **The text states:** ""Ka 1951, molelo o o neng wa tlhosediwa o ne wa sadisa fela masalela Drukgyal Dzong, tse di jaaka ditshwantso tsa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel."" (In 1951, a report destroyed only the remains of Drukgyal Dzong, which are like traces of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.)
* **Option C says:** ""Molelo o ne wa senya masalela a mantsi a kago ya phemelo"" (The report destroyed many remains of the fortress).  The text specifically says *only* the remains were destroyed.
* **Options A, B, and D are accurate according to the text.**

Therefore, option C is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text.



"
Ke polelo efe e e tlhalosang sentle se se neng sa direga morago ga molelo kwa Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **C: Go tuma ga lefelo leno ga go a amega (The site of the fortress was abandoned).**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Morago ga molelo, kago eno ya phemelo e ne ya baakanngwa le go sirelediwa, mme ya nna yone fela e e setseng ya mafelo a a ngokang kgatlhego a kwa Bhutan."" This translates to: ""After the destruction, the fortress site was abandoned and only ruins remained in Bhutan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Selo se le sengwe fela se se neng se setse e ne e le setshwantsho sa ga Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (It was only the ruins of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel).** While the ruins *were* of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's fortress, the question asks what happened *after* the destruction. The answer focuses on the state of the site, not the ruins themselves.
* **B: Masole a Ba-Tibetan le Ba-Mongol a ne a fenya (Tibetan and Mongol soldiers were fighting).** The text mentions the fighting *caused* the destruction, but this option doesn't describe what happened *after*.
* **D: E ne ya bolokwa ke Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (It was protected by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel).**  The text says it was *destroyed* after Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's time.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the abandonment of the site after the destruction.



"
Ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri ka Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **D: Ba-Thai ba ne ba senya Phnom Phen**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Mo dingwageng tsa bofelo tsa bo-1700, ma-Thai ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia makgetlho a le mmalwa mo lekgolong la bo-18 la dingwaga mme ka 1772 ba ne ba senya Phnom Phen."" (In the chronicles of the 1700s, the Thai raided Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they burned Phnom Penh.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba-Vietnam ba ne ba senya Phnom Phen:** The passage states that the Thai burned Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.
* **B: Cambodia e ne ya tlhasela Thailand ka 1772:** The passage states that the Thai raided Cambodia in 1772, not the other way around.
* **C: Cambodia e ne ya tlhaselwa ke Ba-Vietnam kwa tshimologong ya lekgolo la bo18 la dingwaga:** The passage doesn't mention the Vietnamese raiding Cambodia in the 18th century.



"
"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e tlhalosang sentle go tlhaselwa ga Cambodia?","The best answer is **D: Ba-Thai ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia makgetlo a le mmalwa**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for a general description of the invasions of Cambodia.** The passage states that the Thai invaded ""makgetlho a le mmalwa"" (several times) in the 18th century. This is a broader and more accurate description of the situation than the other options.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ba-Vietnam ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia makgetlo a le mmalwa:**  The passage *does* mention Vietnam invaded, but it doesn't say they did so ""makgetlho a le mmalwa."" It only states that they *did* invade.
* **B: Ba-Thai le Ba-Vietnam ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia ka 1772:** This is too specific. While the passage mentions a Thai invasion in 1772, it doesn't say Vietnam invaded *in* 1772.
* **C: Ba-Vietnam ba ne ba senya Phnom Phen:** This focuses on a single event (the destruction of Phnom Phen) and doesn't encompass the broader history of invasions.



Therefore, option D provides the most comprehensive and accurate summary based on the given text."
Ke efe yakhamphani tsa Ma-Dutch a ko Botlhaba jwa India e ne ya se ka ya dira eng fa e ne e le kwa Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **A: Nna le lefelo kwa karolong e e kwa borwabophirima jwa setlhaketlhake.**

Here's why:

The passage states that in 1624, the Dutch East India Company claimed land in the northern part of Taiwan.  Option A directly reflects this claim of territory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go lema dithoro tsa tlholego:** While the passage mentions the Dutch initiating valuable commodity production, it doesn't say they were primarily focused on *growing* crops.
* **C: Go thapa badiri ba Machina mo masimong a yone:**  The passage mentions hiring Chinese laborers, but it doesn't say the Dutch were actively *taking* laborers from China to work in the mines.
* **D: Ba iketleeleditse go tlogela go laola Taiwan gore e nne ya losika lwa segosi lwa ga Qing:** The passage indicates the Dutch *did* initially control the northern part of Taiwan before the Qing Dynasty took over. They didn't plan to relinquish control for the Qing.



"
Tumalano ya Shimonoseki e ne ya tlhomamisa eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Taolo ya Japane mo Taiwan**.

The text states: ""In 1895, it was defeated in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, granting Japan control of Taiwan."" This directly indicates that the Treaty of Shimonoseki granted Japan control of Taiwan.
"
pH ya khemikale e lekanngwa jang?,"The correct answer is **C: Palo ya di-ion tsa haeterojene mo khemikaleng**.

Here's why:

* **pH** is specifically defined as a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution. 
* Option C directly reflects this definition: it refers to the *number* of hydrogen ions present.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khemikhale e o e na le beisi le asiti e kana kang:** While acids and bases are related to pH, this isn't the *definition* of pH itself.  The strength of an acid or base determines its pH, not just the presence of either.
* **B: Go na le diprotone tse kae mo khemikaleng:** While hydrogen ions *do* have protons, the pH scale specifically measures the concentration of *hydrogen ions* (H+), not just the total number of protons.
* **D: Go na le dieleketerone tse kae mo khemikaleng:** Electrons are related to the overall electrical charge of an atom, but not directly to the pH scale.
"
Go ne ga ntshiwa eng mo di-ioneng tsa haeterojene?,"The correct answer is **A: Diprotone**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diayone tsa Hydrogen ke di-proton tse di kgaogantsweng le di-electron tsa tsone..."" This directly identifies protons as a component of hydrogen ions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH:** pH is a *measure* of the concentration of hydrogen ions, not the ions themselves.
* **C: Alkalaene:**  While alkali substances are alkaline, the passage links pH to the concentration of hydrogen ions, not specifically to alkali.
* **D: Di-eleketerone:**  While hydrogen atoms *do* have electrons, the passage specifically states that hydrogen ions are *proton* ions.



"
Ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang a a sa tlhalosang setlhopha sa ditau sentle?,"The correct answer is **B: Palo ya banna le basadi ga e lekane (The ratio of males to females is not balanced)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Manamagi a teng, ga ntsi a a sikana, e le lelwapa le le tona la bagolole le barwadi."" This translates to: ""There are females, but not many, forming the majority of the group of males and females.""  This implies an imbalance in the sex ratio, with significantly fewer males than females.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di itshwara fela jaaka motlhape wa dintša (They only organize themselves like a herd of antelopes):** While they do organize like herds, the text emphasizes their unique social structure. This isn't the *unexplained* aspect.
* **C: Ditona le namagadi tsotlhe di amana thata (All females and males get along badly):** The text doesn't suggest that females and males clash. It highlights that females form the majority.
* **D: Di a bolaya e bile di dirisana le batho (They kill and interact with humans):**  The text doesn't mention hunting humans. It focuses on their internal social dynamics.



"
Ke dipolelo dife mo go tse di latelang tse di sa tlhalosang sentle tsela e ditau di itshwarang ka yone?,"The correct answer is **A: Di rata batho thata**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that lions live in groups called prides and that their behavior is similar to that of other felines (like leopards or jaguars). It also mentions their social structure, including males, females, and cubs.

Option A, ""Di rata batho thata"" (They love humans), is **not** mentioned in the passage and is therefore not a characteristic described as part of their social structure or behavior.  It's an extraneous statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Boitshwaro jwa tsone bo tshwana le jwa diphiri** (Their behavior is similar to that of hyenas) - This is **correctly described** in the passage.
* **C: Tse ditonanyana le tse di namagadi di kotsi thata mo diphologolong tse dingwe** (Young and female ones are very dangerous to other prey) - While the passage mentions cubs, it doesn't state that young or female lions are dangerous to other prey. It highlights their role within the pride.
* **D: Boitshwaro jwa bone bo tshwana le jwa dikatse tse dingwe tse dikgolo** (Their behavior is similar to that of other large cats) - This is **correctly described** in the passage.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* explained or mentioned in the passage is that lions love humans.



"
Ke mofuta ofe wa sebatana se gantsi se bolayang mebutla?,"The correct answer is **B: Dikatse tse dikgolo**.

The passage states: ""Mo go tsone go na le dikatse tsa bogolo jo bo mo magareng tse di jang diphologolo tsa bogolo jo bo magareng tse di jaaka mebutla..."" (There are large cats in the jungle that eat large jungle animals like buffaloes...). This directly links large cats with eating buffaloes.
"
Dikatse tse dinnye gantsi di tsoma eng mo go tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditshenekegi**.

The passage states: ""Kwa bofelong, go na le dikatse tse dinnye di le dintsi (go akaretsa dikatse tse di ruiwang tse di sa bofiwang) tse di jang ditshedinyana tse dinnye tse dintsi tse di jaaka ditshenekegi..."" 

This translates to: ""In the forest, there are many other cats (including wild, un-tamed cats) that eat many other small animals that eat things like shrews...""

Therefore, the smaller cats primarily eat shrews (ditshenekegi).
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e seng karolo ya mokgwa wa go tsoma wa ocelot?,"The correct answer is **C: Di sala diphologolo tsa bone morago bosigo (They leave their prey behind)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ocelots hunt by stealth, meaning they stalk their prey.  They *then* pounce on their prey.  It doesn't say they leave prey behind.
* Options A and B are directly mentioned in the passage as part of their hunting strategy.
* Option D is incorrect because the passage states they hunt *other animals* (monko wa diphologolo).
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e sa tlhaloseng sentle gore sebatana sa lengau le go tweng ocelot ke eng? ,"The correct answer is **C: Go dupa ga tsone go bokoa (Their movements are recorded)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that scientists are studying the movements of ocelots to see what they eat based on where they were found.  It doesn't explicitly say the movements are *recorded*. It implies that they are observing and tracking the movements to deduce feeding habits.
* A: ""Di kgona go tsoma sentle bosigo"" (They can move well in the dark) - This is mentioned in the passage.
* B: ""Di tsamaya ka tidimalo"" (They move stealthily) - This is also mentioned in the passage.
* D: ""Di rata go tsoma diphologolo tse dinnye"" (They like to hunt other animals) - This is stated directly in the passage.

Therefore, the only statement that isn't directly or clearly supported by the text is that their movements are recorded.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka se tseweng e le nonofo e kgolo ya nkwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Go rora (To roar)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mefuta eno ya dikatse key one fela e e kgonang go rora."" (This group of cats can only roar.)  The other options (to pounce, to hunt, to growl) are actions that other cats can do."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se dirang gore go nne le pharologanyo fa gare ga ditau le dipitse?","The correct answer is **A: Bokgoni jwa tsone jwa go thuma**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the leopard has a unique ability to roar, unlike other cats (lions, tigers, jaguars). The passage also mentions that this roaring is different from the typical cat meow. The question asks what causes the reverberation (pharologanyo) inside the ears. The passage explicitly links the roaring ability to the leopard's vocalization (go thuma), which creates the reverberation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Modumo wa go kurutla ga tsone (The structure of their throats):** While throat structure contributes to vocalization, the passage focuses on the *ability* to roar as the key factor.
* **C: Tsela e ba tlolelang ka yone (The way they open their mouths):**  Mouth opening is part of vocalization, but not the core reason for the reverberation.
* **D: Maatla a bone a go gogela (Their strength to roar):** Strength is a contributing factor to the volume of the roar, but not the cause of the reverberation inside the ears.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, Robert Hooke o ne a dira eng pele ga baithutatshelo ba bangwe?","The correct answer is **A: Ela tlhoko disele tse di suleng**.

The passage states: ""Robert Hooke, moitsethutatshelo go tswa Engelane, o ne a bona dikhutlonne tse dinnye mo kgokong ka maekerosekoupu. Di ne di bonala jaaka diphaposi. **E ne e le motho wa ntlha go lekola disele tse di suleng.**"" 

This directly indicates that Robert Hooke was significant for examining thin slices (disele tse di suleng).  While he used a microscope to see the cells, the crucial point is that he *examined* them.
"
"""Lefoko """"sele"""" le tswa kae?""","The correct answer is **B: Phaposi e nnye**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lefoko sele le tswa mo lefokong la Selatine la """"cella"""" le le kayang phaposi e nnye."" which translates to ""The word 'cell' comes from the Latin word """"cella"""" meaning a small compartment.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, bontsi jwa diphologolo di kgona go dira eng?","The correct answer is **B: Tsamaya**.

The passage states: ""Bontsi jwa diphologolo di kgona go tsamaya."" which translates to ""Many phologolo can move.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, diphologolo dingwe ga di na eng?","The correct answer is **C: Boboko**.

The passage states: ""Diphologolo ke tsone fela tse di nang le boboko (le fa tota e se diphologolo tsotlhe; ka sekai, jellyfish, yone ga e na boboko)."" which translates to ""Jellyfish are the only ones that have a body (although not all jellyfish have a body; in the world, jellyfish, it doesn't have a body).""

This means that while many jellyfish *do* have a body, the passage specifically mentions that jellyfish (and by extension, some types of jellyfish) *don't* have a body.  Therefore, the option stating that jellyfish lack a body is the most accurate reflection of the text. The other options are characteristics of jellyfish mentioned in the passage.
"
Ke dimela dife tse di thusang mo thulaganyong ya fotosentesese?,"The correct answer is **D: Letsatsi**.

Here's why:

* **Photosynthesis** is the process where plants use sunlight to create their food. 
* The text explicitly states: ""Dimela di itirela dijo go tswa mo letsatsing ka thulaganyo ya photosynthesis."" (Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moriti (Animals):** Animals eat plants, they don't participate in photosynthesis.
* **B: Diphologolo (Insects):** Insects are affected by plants (they eat them, live in them), but don't perform photosynthesis.
* **C: Dijo (Food):** Food is the *result* of photosynthesis, not a component of the process itself.



"
Ke eng se batho ba se hemang se dimela di se hemang?,"The correct answer is **A: Dijo (Food)**.

The passage states: ""Dimela di itirela dijo go tswa mo letsatsing ka thulaganyo ya photosynthesis."" which translates to ""Plants make their own food from the sun through a process called photosynthesis."" 

Therefore, plants are consumed by people for food.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke sekai sefe mo go tse di latelang se se ka kgoreletsang thulaganyo ya go iphetogela ga ditshedi ka botsone go nna tse dingwe?","The correct answer is **A: Setlhopha se sennye se se palelwang ke go atlega mo lefelong le lentshwa.**

Here's why:

The passage describes speciation as the process where a single population diverges into two distinct populations, eventually becoming separate species. This divergence often happens when a small group becomes isolated in a new environment (option A). Being in a new, harsh environment forces them to adapt differently than the original population, leading to genetic differences that can eventually result in reproductive isolation (the key to speciation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Karolo ya batho e e fudugelang kwa lefelong le leša:** While migration can introduce genetic variation, it doesn't necessarily lead to speciation on its own.
*   **C: Palo ya batho e e tlwaelang tikologo e ntšha:**  Simply moving to a new environment isn't enough.  Isolation and adaptation are crucial.
*   **D: Kgabagare batho ba nna babedi:**  This describes a later stage of speciation, not the initial trigger.

Therefore, the passage directly links a small group becoming isolated in a new environment (option A) to the start of the speciation process.



"
Ke dipolelo dife mo go tse di latelang e e sa tlhaloseng sentle gore ditshedi di iphetogela go nna tse dingwe? ,"The correct answer is **A: Go direga fa setlhopha se sesha sa batho se sa kgone go fetoga**.

Here's why:

The passage explains *speciation* as the process by which populations diverge and eventually become distinct species. The passage explicitly states that the initial isolated group *does* adapt and eventually diverges. Option A is the *opposite* of what the passage describes. It suggests the group *cannot* adapt, which contradicts the core concept of speciation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ke thulaganyo e e botlhokwa ya kgolo le phetogo ya ditshedi go nna tse dingwe:** This is a direct restatement of the definition of speciation provided in the passage.
*   **C: Go kaya go bopiwa ga mofuta o mosha wa ditshedi:** This is also a restatement of the outcome of speciation – the creation of a new species.
*   **D: Ga go kake ga tilwa gore go tla direga:**  The entire passage describes speciation as a real and observed biological process.



"
Ke karolo efe ya thulaganyo ya madi e e isang madi kwa pelong?,"The correct answer is **A: Mesifa (Veins)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...diatheri a bo a boela mo pelong ka dipeipe tse di bidiwang **diveini**."" ( ...blood returns to the heart through vessels called **veins**.)

Therefore, veins are the vessels that carry blood *to* the heart.  The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

* **Dikhaphilari (Arteries)** carry blood *away* from the heart.
* **Ditokololo (Capillaries)** are tiny vessels that connect arteries and veins, facilitating the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nutrients.
* **Ditshika (Vessels)** is a general term for blood vessels and doesn't specify the direction of blood flow.



"
Ke ditšhupu dife tse dinnye mo thulaganyong ya madi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditshikana**.

The passage states: ""Madi a tswa mo pelong ka ditshika tse di bidiwang diatheri a bo a boela mo pelong ka dipeipe tse di bidiwang diveini. Dipeipi tse dinnye di bidiwa ditshikana."" which translates to: ""Blood leaves the heart through vessels called arteries and returns to the heart through veins. The smaller vessels are called capillaries.""

Therefore, capillaries are the smaller vessels in the circulatory system mentioned in the text.
"
Bokgoni jwa tshenekegi jwa go mena diphuka tsa yone bo oketsa eng mo go tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **B: Mafelonyana a le mantsi a di ka tshabelang dibatana mo go one.**

Here's why:

The passage states that dragonflies and mayflies rely on their ability to catch prey to raise their young.  It then says that dragonflies have many appendages (mafelonyana) for catching prey. Therefore, the ability to catch prey leads to having many appendages that can hold prey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Phepelo ya dijo:** While catching prey *provides* food, the question asks what the ability to catch prey *itself* results in.
* **C: Go batla ditsala:** The passage connects catching prey with finding food and materials, not specifically with finding plants.
* **D: Lobelo lwa sefofane:** This is a general statement and not a direct consequence of the ability to catch prey.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa umakiweng mo serapeng e le sengwe se se amang bokgoni jwa tshenekegi jwa go fofa?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsala (To give birth)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how the ability to fly helps dragonflies and mayflies hunt. It mentions their ability to catch insects in mid-air, thanks to their numerous eyes.  The question asks what is *not* related to this flying ability.

*   **Go kokoanya dijo (To hunt for food):** This *is* directly related to flight – flight allows them to find and catch prey.
*   **Go lekana (To balance):**  Flight requires balance.
*   **Botshelo jotlhe (Entire life):** Flight is a part of their life cycle and hunting behaviour.
*   **Go tsala (To give birth):**  Reproduction (giving birth) is a separate life process and not directly tied to the *ability* to fly, although flight might help with finding a mate.

Therefore, giving birth is the only option not explicitly connected to the flying ability discussed in the passage."
Ke mokgwa ofe mo go e e latelang e gantsi e sa amaneng le di-dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsamaya ka leoto le le kwa morago**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes dinonyane (small dinosaurs) and mentions they walk on two legs like a T-Rex.
*   Option A, ""Go tsamaya ka leoto le le kwa morago"" (Walking on two legs and backwards), is a characteristic explicitly attributed to dinonyane in the text and is thus a dinosaur-like trait.
*   Option B, ""Diphofa"" (Claws), are present on many animals, including dinosaurs, so it isn't unique to dinosaurs.
*   Option C, ""Go beela mae"" (Laying eggs), is also common to many animals, including dinosaurs.
*   Option D, ""Maoto a a nang le manala"" (Feet with claws), are also present in many animals, so it isn't unique to dinosaurs.

Therefore, the most dinosaur-like characteristic among the options is walking on two legs and backward."
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e gantsi e sa tseweng e tshwana le dinonyane le di-dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **B: Go tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi a kwa morago**.

Here's why:

* The question states that ""Di na le maoto a magwatlale le dinala, di baya mae, di tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi a ko morago jaaka T-Rex.""  This directly describes bipedal locomotion (walking on two legs) similar to how a T-Rex moved.
* Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:
    * **A: Go beela mae:**  While some dinosaurs did care for their young, this isn't a defining characteristic shared with the animal being described (dinonyane).
    * **C: Go kgona go fofa:**  The passage specifically states that people *don't* consider dinonyane dinosaurs because they can ""fofa"" (breathe/respire), implying dinosaurs don't breathe the same way.
    * **D: Maoto a a nang le manala:** While some dinosaurs had claws, the passage mentions *dinala* (claws) specifically in connection with the dinonyane, and this is a common feature in many animals, not just dinosaurs.



Therefore, the shared characteristic of walking on two legs is the most accurate and directly supported answer.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke karolo efe ya semela sa cycad e Di-Triceratop e ka nnang ya e ja?","The correct answer is **A: Mathare a a motswi (Cones)**.

The text states: ""Banetetshi bangwe ba akanya go re triceratops e ne e ja di-cycad - mofuta wa dimela tse di neng di atile thata mo pakeng ya Cretaceous. Ditlhare tse di lebega jaaka ditlhare tsa palm tse di nnye, tse di mathare a a motswi.""

This indicates that Triceratops likely ate the cones (mathare a a motswi) of the cycad plant.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng mo go tse di latelang se Di-Triceratop e ka se jang? ","The correct answer is **D: Semela se se nang le maungo a a botlhole (Fossilized plants with tough fibers)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Triceratops likely ate cycads, which are plants that had tough, palm-like leaves.
* It also mentions that some paleontologists believe Triceratops used its strong beak to strip leaves from branches.
* Finally, it says that some fossils show Triceratops eating fossilized plants with tough fibers, suggesting a diet of tough plants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sloth:** Sloths are mammals and not related to dinosaurs.
* **B: Semela se se nang le dikala tse di thata (Plants with tough stems):** While Triceratops *might* have eaten some plants with tough stems, the primary focus of the text is on leaves and cycads.
* **C: Papalagae (Mangoes):** Mangoes are fruits and not a focus of the text describing Triceratops's diet.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mofuta efe ya metshameko e e latelang e e ka tswang o ratiwa thata kwa dikgaolong tse di kwa bokone jwa Italy?","The correct answer is **C: Go palama snowboard**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""Metshameko ya mariga e tumile thata mo dikgaolong tsa Bokone..."" which translates to ""Eight sports are very popular in the northern regions...""
*  The passage lists several sports including ""rugby, wa dibaesekele, hockey ya serame le ya ditlhako tsa maotswana"" which are typically associated with colder, mountainous regions and therefore more likely to be popular in the northern parts of Italy.
*  **Go palama snowboard** (Snowboarding) is a winter sport directly linked to mountainous, snowy regions – fitting the description of popular sports in northern Italy.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kgwele ya Dinao (Ice Hockey):** While ice hockey is played in colder climates, the passage specifically mentions other sports more strongly associated with the northern regions. 
* **B: Motshameko wa volleyball (Volleyball):** Volleyball is a popular sport worldwide but isn't specifically linked to northern Italy in the context of the passage.
* **D: F1 dikoloi tsa lobelo (Formula 1 Cars):** Formula 1 is a global sport and while Italy has a strong association with it, it's not specifically tied to the northern regions in the same way winter sports are.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng eno, ke mofuta ofe wa metshameko e e latelang o o neng wa dira gore Italy e nne mmampodi wa lefatshe?","The correct answer is **A: Kgwele ya Dinao (Football)**.

The text states that both the Italian and German national teams are among the two fastest in the world and were finalists in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.  Football (Kgwele ya Dinao) is explicitly mentioned as one of the top sports.  The fact that Italy was a finalist in the World Cup directly implies that football is a major sport for them.
"
Ke tiragalo efe e e neng ya dira gore dikarolo dingwe tsa Luxembourg e nne tsa Belgium?,"The correct answer is **B: Diphetogo Tsa Kwa Belgium**.

The passage states: ""Dikarolo tsa segompieno tsa Belgium e ne e le karolo ya Luxembourg mo nakong e e fetileng mme ya nna karolo ya Belgium morago ga Phetogo ya kwa Belgium ya bo-1830."" This directly links the Belgian Revolution to the incorporation of parts of Luxembourg into Belgium.
"
Ke maemo afe a a latelang a a neng a ama boitlhaodi jwa Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **C: Diphetogo Tsa Kwa Belgium**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Dikarolo tsa segompieno tsa Belgium e ne e le karolo ya Luxembourg mo nakong e e fetileng mme ya nna karolo ya Belgium morago ga Phetogo ya kwa Belgium ya bo-1830."" (Parts of present-day Belgium were once part of Luxembourg and later became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go nniwa ke Jeremane:** While Luxembourg *was* under German influence at times, the text doesn't mention it being ""given"" to Germany. It implies a more complex history of being part of the German Confederation.
* **B: Go tsena mo Lekgotleng la Ditšhaba Tse di Kopaneng tsa Yuropa:** Luxembourg joined the European Union in 1957, which is mentioned in the text, but it isn't the *initial* event relating to its sovereignty.
* **D: Go nna naga e e ikemetseng:** The text says Luxembourg ""ga e bolo go nna e leka go nna naga e e itlhaotseng"" (was unable to try to become an independent nation).  It was not an independent nation until later.



Therefore, **C: Diphetogo Tsa Kwa Belgium** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Ke dikilometara di le kae tsa sekwere tsa naga ya Turkey tse di mo Yuropa?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage states: ""Lefelo la Turkey, go akaretsa le matsha, le disekwere khilomithara di le 783,562 (300,948 sq mi), tse mo go tsone disekwere khilomithara di le 755,688 (291,773 sq mi) di leng kwa borwa-bophirima jwa Asia le disekwere khilomithara di le 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) di leng kwa Yuropa."" This translates to ""The area of Turkey, including the new land, is 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 (291,773 sq mi) are in western Asia and 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) are in Europe.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, Turkey e boleele jwa dikilometara di le kae?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The passage states: ""Tshimo ya kwa Turkey e bogolo jo bo fetang dikhilomithara di le 1,600 (dimaele di le 1,000)..."" which translates to ""The east of Turkey is large, exceeding 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles)...""
"
Puo ya Selatine e dirisiwa jang kwa Toropong ya Vatican?,"The correct answer is **D: Molaetsa wa semmuso**.

The text states: ""Toropo ya Vatican e dirisa puo ya se-Ithali mo mekwalong ya moloa le dikanamisong tsa semmuso."" This translates to ""The Vatican City uses the Italian language in official documents and formal settings."" Therefore, Latin is used in an official capacity, not for everyday conversation.
"
"Kwa Toropong ya Vatican, Setadiana ga se dirisiwe mo go eng?","The correct answer is **A: Molao (Law)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Vatican City uses Italian in official documents and communications.  It *doesn't* mention that Italian is used in law. It focuses on official communication and religious context. The other options *could* potentially be used in Vatican City (official messages, friendly markets, daily conversations), but the passage highlights Italian's use in formal documentation.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke melemo efe e e latelang ya go kopanya modumo mo dikhomputareng tse di raraaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Mmino**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Mmino ga ntsi o gatisiwa ka dikhomputara tse di tlhatlhameng go tsamaisa le go tswakanya medumo mmogo.""  This translates to: ""Music is often played on computers to run and share melodies together.""

While computers *can* be used for images and models (options B & C), and can be used for building (option D), the text specifically highlights the use of computers for *music*.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, bontsi jwa matlo a a mo lefelong lefe a ne a na le matlwana a boithomelo a a tlhatswang metsi?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Masalela a mafaratlhatlha a kgopo ya metsi a aleswe a fitlhetswe mo mantlong a ditotopo tsa ma_Minoa tsa Crete le Santorini kwa lefatsheng la Greece. **Go ne go na le matlwanaboithomelo kwa Egepeto, Peresia le China tsa bogologolo.**""  It then directly links the presence of water storage to the Harappan and Mohenjo-daro civilizations.

Therefore, based on the passage, Mohenjo-daro is the civilization mentioned as having water storage facilities within homes.
"
Ke mafelo afe mo go a a latelang a a neng a na le dithulaganyo tse di tlhabologileng tsa go tsamaisa leswe?,"The correct answer is **C: Egepeto** and **D: China**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""matlwanaboithomelo kwa Egepeto, Peresia le China tsa bogologolo."" This directly indicates that Egypt and China had advanced systems of water management.
*  While Harappa and Santorini did have water management, the passage specifically mentions that the water systems in Crete and Santorini were *similar* to those found in the Indus Valley Civilization (Harappa). This implies they were advanced, but not necessarily at the same level as Egypt and China.



Therefore, both Egypt and China are correct answers based on the information provided."
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e dirang gore motshameki a retologe?,"The correct answer is **B: Matlhakore a mabedi go bapa le legare la sekete** (Both ankles and the kneecap).

Here's why:

The passage describes how when the tendons around the kneecap are damaged, the bones of the lower leg (tshware botoka) rotate. This rotation causes the lower leg to twist, and the ankle (letlhakore) on one side twists in the opposite direction. This twisting action is what leads to the person needing to walk with a crutch (retologe).  Therefore, damage to *both* ankles and the kneecap is the condition that causes this twisting and necessitates the crutch.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mokgoko o monnye o o mo tlase ga legare la sekate (A single splinter below the kneecap):** A single splinter wouldn't cause the systemic twisting described in the passage.
*   **C: Seemo sa bokgoni jwa motshameki (The flexibility of the muscles):** Muscle flexibility might influence how someone *walks* with a crutch, but it doesn't cause the initial twisting and the need for the crutch itself.
*   **D: Boleng jwa aese (The health of the tendons):** While tendon health is related, the passage specifically mentions the *kneecap tendons* and how their damage leads to the twisting motion involving both ankles.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang a a tlhalosang sentle phatlha e e mo letlhakoreng la seketswana sa gompieno?","The correct answer is **D: E sekame**. 

Here's why:

The passage describes a phenomenon where a surface (like a riverbank) erodes due to the action of two different types of water flow. This erosion *causes* the land to be broken apart (sekame). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E na le matlhakore a mabedi (It has two rivers):** The passage isn't primarily about the presence of two rivers; it's about the *interaction* of two different water flows.
* **B: Go kobega (To thrive/flourish):** This describes a positive state, the opposite of what's happening with erosion.
* **C: Sephara (To be beautiful):** While the land *might* be beautiful before erosion, the passage focuses on the destructive process.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke thulaganyo efe e e dirang gore diatomo di kgone go ntsha maatla a a feteletseng mo leseding?","The correct answer is **B: Go ntshiwa ga difothone go go tlhotlheletsang** (The emission of photons is essential).

Here's why:

The text explains that atoms emit light (energy) by releasing tiny packets of energy called photons. This process is called ""go ntshiwa ga marang a a fetlhilweng"" (stimulated emission). The question asks *what* allows atoms to emit energy as light. The text directly states that this emission *is* the key process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maatla a marang** (Energy waves): While light *is* a type of energy wave, the text specifies the *mechanism* by which atoms release this energy - the emission of photons.
*   **C: Fothone** (Photon): Photons are the *result* of the process, not the *cause* of the energy release.
*   **D: Go ntshiwa ga marang** (Stimulated emission): While stimulated emission is the name of the process, the question asks *what* allows the atoms to release the energy, and the answer is the emission of photons.



"
Ke eng se se dirang gore atomo e ntshe fotone?,"The correct answer is **B: Tlhotlheletso e e bakwang ke lesedi le le phatsimang.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ba dira se ka go ntsha lebonenyana le le nnye le le bidiwang """"photon"""". Baitsesaense ba bitsa tsamaiso eno go re ke """"go ntshiwa ga marang a a fetlhilweng"""" ka go nne diathomo di fetlhwa ke lesedi le le tsabakelang, le le bakang go re go ntshiwe photon ya lesedi, mme lesedi ke nngwe ya mofuta wa marang.""

This translates to: ""They do it by emitting a tiny particle called a """"photon"""". Scientists call this process """"spontaneous emission"""" in which atoms are changed by a bright light, causing a photon of light to be emitted, and light is one type of radiation.""

Option B directly reflects this description -  the emission is caused by a bright light. The passage connects the emission of photons to being changed by bright light.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ntsha maatla a a oketsegeng** (Emitting stored energy): While atoms *can* emit stored energy, the passage specifically links the emission to bright light and ""spontaneous emission."" It doesn't just say atoms emit stored energy.
* **C: Maemo a a sa tlhomamang a maatla** (Unstable energy states):  Unstable energy states *lead* to spontaneous emission, but the emission itself is directly *caused* by the interaction with the bright light.
* **D: Go tsibogela marang ka tsela e e sa siamang** (Emitting radiation in an abnormal way):  The passage describes the emission as a normal process called ""spontaneous emission."" It's not abnormal.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se kgabagare se tla dirang gore tleloupo e emise go bereka?","The correct answer is **C: Thapo e e mo teng ga tleloupo e a tima**.

Here's why:

The problem states that the ""lebone le ne la felela le sha le bole sa tlhole le bereka"" - meaning the light bulb burned out and stopped working.  The text also warns about electrical issues. 

Option C directly addresses a potential electrical problem: ""Thapo e e mo teng ga tleloupo e a tima"" - The wire inside the light bulb is burnt. This is a common cause of a light bulb burning out.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Mabone ga a timiwe sentle** - Poorly tightened contacts can cause problems, but usually result in a flickering light rather than a complete burn-out.
* **B: E na le motheo wa tshipi wa tleloupu e le nngwe fela** - A single filament is normal for most light bulbs.
* **D: Motlakase o tsena mo seleng o a fokotsega** - While this *can* happen, the text focuses on the wire inside the bulb as a more probable cause.



Therefore, based on the information provided, a burnt wire is the most likely reason for the light bulb to stop working."
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e ka nnang kotsi go se ama fa o fetola tleloupo?,"The correct answer is **B: Switšhi ya lebone (Light switch)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that disconnecting the power source (light switch or wire) is crucial when replacing a light fixture. It warns about the danger of electricity potentially flowing through parts of the fixture, especially if there's a broken wire.  The light switch is a direct electrical component.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Mogala (Bulb):** While the bulb is part of the fixture, the main danger lies in the live electrical components, not the bulb itself.
*   **C: Beisi ya tleloupu (Fixture base):** The fixture base is the mounting point, and while it *could* have electrical connections, the switch is more directly involved in controlling the power.
*   **D: Mogala (Bulb):** Same reason as A, the bulb itself is not the main risk.

Therefore, the light switch is the component that poses the most significant electrical hazard during replacement.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go direga eng fa nutlease e kgaogana?","The correct answer is **A: Diprotone di a oketsega**.

Here's why:

The passage states that nuclear fission involves splitting a nucleus into smaller nuclei, releasing energy and neutrons.  When a nucleus fissions, the number of protons in the resulting nuclei *decreases* compared to the original nucleus.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go ntshiwa maatla** - While energy is released in fission, this doesn't describe *what happens to the nucleus itself*.
*   **C: Diathomo ga di tlhomame** - Fission *does* involve atoms breaking apart, but it doesn't say they don't become stable. The resulting atoms are generally more stable than the original, heavier nucleus.
*   **D: Di-neutron di a nyelela** - Neutrons are *released* during fission, they don't move *into* the nucleus in this process.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided information is that protons decrease during nuclear fission. The best way to rephrase that option to fit the given choices is that protons *increase* in the *resulting* nuclei (though this is technically a slight misstatement - it's more accurate to say the number of protons per *resulting* nucleus is lower than in the original).

However, since the options are not perfectly worded, and ""Diprotone di a oketsega"" is the *closest* and technically least incorrect answer, it is the best choice."
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e bontshang gore go na le difouno tsa sekgala se seleele tse di yang kwa Lefatsheng,"The correct answer is **B: Disathalaete (Satellites)**.

The passage explicitly states that satellites are used to collect data about Earth and that they are launched into space via rockets.  The question asks what *shows* the existence of these distant, sophisticated tools. Satellites are the key evidence of their presence.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Dithelesekoupo (Telescopes):** Telescopes are used *to observe* satellites and other celestial objects, but they don't *show* the existence of the satellites themselves.
* **C: Dipone (Telescopes):** Same reasoning as above.
* **D: Didirisiwa tsa rokete (Rocket launches):** While rocket launches are *necessary* to put satellites into space, the rockets themselves are not the evidence of the satellites. They are the means of transport.



"
Ke efe ya tsone e e dirisiwang go romela thelesekoupo mo lefaufaung?,"The correct answer is **B: Didirisiwa tsa rokete (Rocket propulsion)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tsaya rokete e kgolo thata bogodimo jwa dikgato di feta 100 go ya kwa godimo go baya sathalaete kgotsa thelesekoupu mo lefaufaung"" which translates to ""Launching a large rocket above 100 tonnes to send a satellite or telecommunications device into space."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Marang a Lesedi (Light emissions):** While satellites *reflect* light, light emissions are not used to *send* them into space.
* **C: Atemosefere ya lefatshe (Earth's atmosphere):** The atmosphere is *what* the rocket must overcome to reach space, not a method of sending something there.
* **D: Disathalaete tse di kwa godimo ga dimetara di le 100 (Satellites above 100 meters):**  Satellites are *the thing being sent*, not the method of transportation.



"
Ke eng se re tshwanetseng go se ela tlhoko ka tiragalo e e diregang gangwe le gape gore re kgone go bona gore nako e tsamaya jang?,"The correct answer is **A: Lobaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nako e dirisiwa gape go lekanya lobaka lwa ditiragalo."" This translates to ""Time is also used to measure the extent of events.""  ""Lobaka"" means extent or scope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go boeletsa (Observation):** While observation is helpful for understanding time, the passage directly links time to *measuring the extent* of events, not just observing them.
* **C: Go ama (To affect/impact):**  The passage states time *affects* everything, but it doesn't say that *affecting* things is how we measure time's passage.
* **D: Bothata (Problem/Difficulty):**  The passage doesn't connect time to problems or difficulties.



Therefore, the passage explicitly connects time to measuring the **extent** or **scope** of events, making ""Lobaka"" the most accurate answer."
"Go ya ka serapa, nako e dirisiwa go tshwantsha karolo efe ya tiragalo?","The correct answer is **C: Maitemogelo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nako e dirisiwa gape go lekanya lobaka lwa ditiragalo."" (Time is also used to measure the extent of events.)  ""Lobaka"" (extent) refers to the *scope* or *range* of an event.  The passage then says we can compare the passage of time to our own, by observing things happening in sequence. This implies that time helps us understand the *pattern* or *model* of events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boleele** (Belief) - While belief might influence how we perceive time, it isn't the primary function of time itself according to the passage.
*   **B: Go boeletsa** (To be calm/peaceful) - The passage doesn't connect time with calmness.
*   **D: Go ama** (To touch/grip) - This doesn't relate to how time functions as a measure of events.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tsewang e le e e tshwanelang moruaboswa wa bogosi?","The correct answer is **D: Go ya yunibesithing pele ga ke ya bosoleng**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Le fa go ntse jalo, Charles o ne a ya mmadikolo kwa Trinity College, Cambridge ko a ithutela boitseanape jwa Anthropology le Archaelogy, mme moragonya Hisetori, mme a falola ka 2.2(seetsele sa boleng jwa bobedi jo bo potlana)."" This confirms he went to university *before* going to the palace.
* The passage also mentions he was a prince, highlighting his royal lineage, but the key point related to his academic path is attending university first.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go bona dikirii ya 2:2:** While he achieved a 2:2, the crucial point isn't the specific grade, but that he pursued higher education *before* his royal duties.
* **B: O tlogela yunibesithi gore a ye bosoleng:** The passage explicitly says he *went* to university, not left it to go to the palace.
* **C: Go Ithuta Hisitori:**  He studied History, but the main point is his academic journey *prior* to becoming a prince.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng seno, Charles e ne e le ene wa ntlha go dira eng?","The correct answer is **B: Ithute Thutamarope**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka tlwaelo, moja-boswa wa bogosi o ne a tlhamalela ko sesoleng fela ga a fetsa sekolo. Le fa go ntse jalo, Charles o ne a ya mmadikolo kwa Trinity College, Cambridge ko a ithutela boitseanape jwa Anthropology le Archaelogy, mme moragonya Hisetori...""

This translates to: ""Normally, a royal heir would only attend school until after completing secondary school. However, Charles went to Cambridge University, studying Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History...""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that Charles *studied History*.
"
Sekepe sa ga Trygvasson se ne se tswa kwa nageng efe?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The passage states: ""Boidiidi jo bo ne bo eteletswe ke Olaf Trygvasson, monna wa mo-Norway..."" which translates to ""The forces were led by Olaf Trygvasson, a man from Norway...""
"
Jeremane e ne ya tlhotlheletsa setso sa Estonia thata ka nako efe?,"The passage states: ""Ka nako e lekgolo ya dingwaga di ka nna 15..."" which translates to ""For a period of about 15 years..."".  The passage then goes on to describe the early stages of German influence.  The question asks about *how long* Germany dominated Estonia. The passage doesn't give a specific timeframe for *the entire period of dominance*, only that the German influence began around 15 years ago.

However, the options all refer to much longer periods.  The key phrase is ""ka nako e lekgolo ya dingwaga di ka nna 15"" which means ""for a period of approximately 15 years"". It then states that the Estonian language was influenced, and that a German alphabet was used. There's no specific timeframe mentioned.

Since the question asks when Germany *dominated*, and the passage only gives a starting point of 15 years, none of the answers are directly supported. However, we can infer that the German influence was significant and lasted a considerable amount of time.  The options are all quite long. Considering the gradual assimilation of German words and the replacement of the Estonian ""Õ/õ"" with German equivalents, it's likely the influence wasn't just 15 years. The most reasonable (though not directly supported) inference, given the choices, would be a long period.

However, this is tricky because the passage doesn't *state* a timeframe.  We're forced to choose the *most plausible* option given the context. Given the choices, and the implication of gradual language shift, 800 years seems like a massive understatement of the influence. It is likely that the dominance was for a very long time.



**Therefore, based on the provided options and the limited information in the passage, none of the answers are explicitly correct. However, the closest and most plausible answer given the choices would be D: Mo e ka nnang dingwaga di le 800 tse di fetileng (Could be 800 years ago).** The passage simply doesn't give us a specific timeframe for the German dominance, only that the influence began around 15 years ago, and the passage discusses a gradual language shift.



"
Ke eng se se neng sa tlhotlheletsa puo ya Seestonia?,"The correct answer is **B: Alefabete ya Sejeremane**.

The passage states that the early Estonian language was based on the German alphabet. This indicates the German alphabet was a major factor in shaping the development of Estonian.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, palo ya batho ba ba buang Se-Hindi e farologana go ya ka ntlha efe?","The correct answer is **A: Fa go balwa dipuo tse di tshwanang thata le Se-Hindi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Teme ya Hindi le ya Urdu di tshwana ka puo mme di farologana mo go kwaleng; fa go tserwe dikgang tsa letsatsi le letsatsi, babui ba diteme tsoo-pedi go le ga ntsi ba a tlhaloganyana.""  This translates to: ""The Hindi and Urdu languages are similar, but they differ in writing; when daily usage is considered, many speakers of the two languages understand each other.""

This implies that the numbers provided (340 million to 500 million speaking Hindi as a first language, and potentially 800 million understanding Hindi) include speakers of languages *similar* to Hindi. Options B, C, and D are too narrow and don't encompass the range of speakers implied in the text.
"
Ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri ka Sehindi le Seurdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Di farologana ka mokwalo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Teme ya Hindi le ya Urdu di tshwana ka puo mme di farologana mo go kwaleng..."" This translates to ""The Hindi and Urdu scripts are similar but differ in writing."" 

Therefore, option B is the only accurate statement based on the provided text.
"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e seng boammaaruri ka dialefabete tsa Sehangeul?,"The correct answer is **D: E ne e tlhamilwe ka bomo (It was created by accident)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kwa tshimologong o ne a taya alfabete ya Hangeul leina la Hunmin Jeongeum..."" which translates to ""At first, he created the Hangeul alphabet called Hunmin Jeongeum...""  This indicates it wasn't accidental.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: E ne ya tlhamiwa kwa tshimologong ya puso ya ga Kgosi Sejong (It was created at the beginning of King Sejong's reign):** The passage says it was created during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
* **B: Leina la ntlhantlha la mokwalo ono e ne e le Hunan Jeongeum (The original name of the alphabet was Hunmin Jeongeum):** The passage clearly states the original name was Hunmin Jeongeum.
* **C: E ne ya tlhamiwa ke kgosi ya bonè ya Mmusomogolo wa Joseon (It was created by the most respected king of the Joseon Kingdom):** King Sejong is described as a highly respected and esteemed king of the Joseon Kingdom.



Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the passage is that it was created by accident.



"
Kgabagare dialefabete tsa Hunmin Jeongeum di ne tsa fetolwa go nna eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The text states that King Sejong created the alphabet Hangeul, also known as Hunmin Jeongeum.
"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke dipuo dife tse di neng tsa tlhotlhelediwa ke Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **A: Dipuo tsa Selatine**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sanskrit ke puo ya bogologolo e tshwanang le puo ya se Selatine e e neng e buiwa kwa Yuropa."" (Sanskrit is a classical language similar to the Latin language spoken in Europe.)

While Sanskrit influenced many Indian languages, the text directly compares it to Latin and its role in the development of European languages. Therefore, Latin is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, go ne ga fokotsega go dirisiwa ga Sanskrit ka ntlha ya eng?","The correct answer is **B: Go fuduga ga ma-Aryan**.

The text states: ""Sanskrit ke puo ya bogologolo e tshwanang le puo ya se Selatine e e neng e buiwa kwa Yuropa. Buka ya pele e e itsegeng mo lefatsheng ene e kwadilwe ka se Sanskrit. Morago ga gore Upanishads e kgobokanngwe, Sanskrit e ile ya nyelela ka ntlha ya thulaganyotatelano.

This indicates that the spread of the Aryan migration was the initial reason for Sanskrit's presence in India. The other options are consequences of Sanskrit's history, not the initial reason for its use.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri malebana le kgogelofatshe a Io?","The correct answer is **A: Maatla a magolo a lefatshe a ka go gogela kwa tlase go feta maatla a magolo a lefatshe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that gravity on Io is weaker than on Earth.**  This means that Io's gravitational pull is less.
* **Lower gravity means you weigh less.** This is directly related to the passage's explanation of how weight changes on different planets.
* **Option A accurately reflects this:**  It states that Io's gravity can pull on you *less* than Earth's gravity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maatla a magolo a maatlakgogedi a dira gore go nne thata, ke gone ka moo o ka se kang wa kgona go dira jalo:** This refers to the strength needed to move *yourself* in a different gravitational environment. While true, it's not directly about the *gravity itself*.
* **C: Maatla a magolo a maatlakgogedi a dira gore o nne bokete thata, ke ka moo o ka bong o le bokete thata:** This is incorrect and nonsensical.  Strength doesn't make you ""heavy"".
* **D: Maatla a magolo a lefatshe a go gogela mo go wena a feta maatla a magolo a lefatshe:** This is the opposite of what the passage explains. It says Io's gravity is *weaker*.



Therefore, only Option A correctly describes the relationship between Io's gravity and how it affects your weight.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Legogo le, le boteng ja dikhilomithara di ka nna masome a supa (70km) mo letlhakoreng le le gaufi, le bo le nna dikhilomithara di ka nna lekgolo mo letlhakoreng le le kgakala. **Go le sesane fa tlase ga mawatle, la bo le nna lekimanyana fa tlase ga dithota.**""
* **This translates to:** ""The bulge, with a width of up to 70km in the near hemisphere, and being much wider in the far hemisphere. **It is located beneath the sea, and is small beneath the mountains.**""
* **Option D directly reflects this:** ""Go ka nna ga nna le di-maria tse di kwa tlase ga dithaba"" (It can be that there are bulges beneath the mountains).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kafa letlhakoreng le le fa gaufi go na le dikgapetla tse di motsu** (How the near hemisphere has mountainous formations) - The passage doesn't focus on mountainous formations in the near hemisphere as a defining characteristic of the bulge.
* **B: Mo dithabeng go na le mmu o mosesane** (Beneath the mountains there is a small bulge) - While the passage mentions bulges beneath mountains, option D is a more precise and direct reflection of the text.
* **C: Go ka nna ga bo go na Maria yo monnye kwa letlhakoreng le lengwe** (There might be a single bulge in one hemisphere) - The passage talks about *two* hemispheres, not just one.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke kae mo kgolokwe ya ngwedi e leng tona thata gone?","The correct answer is **A: Mo letlhakoreng le le gaufi**.

The passage states: ""Legogo le, le boteng ja dikhilomithara di ka nna masome a supa (70km) mo letlhakoreng le le gaufi...""  This translates to ""The crater, with a diameter of up to (70km) is in the near side..."" 

Therefore, the near side (letlhakoreng le le gaufi) is where the dark area of the Moon is predominantly located.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e batho bangwe ba e dumelang?","The correct answer is **C: Go na le botshelo mo dipolaneteng tse dingwe** (There is life on other planets).

The passage states: ""...bangwe ba ipotsa go re go na leng eng koo, bangwe ba dumela go re go na le batho ba ba sa tsheleng jaaka rona kgotsa botshelo jo bongwe jo bo farologanang le jwa rona."" (some wonder what's there, others believe there are people who don't live like us or a different kind of life). This directly points to the belief that life exists elsewhere.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batho ba ile ba ya kwa dinaleding tse dingwe** (People have gone to other planets): The passage says this hasn't happened yet (""ga se kake sa direga ka lobaka lo lo leele"").
*   **B: Batho ga ba kgone go ithuta ka mafatshe a mangwe** (People can't learn about other planets): The passage talks about learning from the data gathered by space agencies.
*   **D: Go na le dikilometara di le dibilionebilione fa gare ga dinaledi** (There are kilometers and billions inside planets): This is a detail about the size of planets, not a belief about life on other planets.



"
Ke eng se se nnang sennye fa o ntse o katogela kgakala le bogare jwa letsatsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Plasema**.

Here's why:

* **Plasma** is the fourth state of matter, and it's the most abundant state of matter in the universe.  The Sun's outer layers are made up of plasma – superheated gas where electrons have been stripped from atoms. This is a result of the extreme heat and pressure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Molelo (Molecule):** Molecules are formed by two or more atoms bonded together. While the Sun contains molecules, the dominant state of matter is plasma.
* **Gase (Gas):**  While the Sun *does* contain gas, it's not just ordinary gas. The extreme temperatures have ionized the gas into plasma.
* **Khukhwane (Crust):** Crust refers to the outermost solid layer of a planet or moon. The Sun is a ball of plasma, not a solid with a crust.



Therefore, the Sun's outer layers are primarily **plasma**."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke karolo efe ya letsatsi e e bonalang go tswa mo lefatsheng?","The correct answer is **C: Photosphere**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Selol se re se bonang mo bokafantleng jwa letsatsi se bidiwa photosphere, mo go rayang go re “kgolokwe ya lesedi”."" This translates to: ""The layer we see on the surface of the sun is called the photosphere, meaning 'sphere of light'.""

Therefore, the photosphere is the visible surface of the sun, and the passage directly identifies it as the part we see. The other options are incorrect based on the passage's definition.
"
Ke eng se se neng sa thusa go tlhomamisa kgopolo ya ga Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikarolo tsa Venus (Phata tsa Venus)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Galileo's observation of the phases of Venus (having two ""moons"" like the Moon) *supported* Copernicus's heliocentric theory (that the planets revolve around the Sun). The phases of Venus couldn't be explained by the geocentric model (Earth-centered) without the planet orbiting the Sun.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tsamaya ga Venus (Venus's motion):** While observing Venus's motion was important, it was the *phases* of Venus that provided the decisive evidence.
* **C: Go tshwana ga Letsatsi le Venus (Similarity between the Sun and Venus):** The passage doesn't mention a similarity between the Sun and Venus as a factor in supporting Copernicus.
* **D: Go tshwana ga Letsatsi le Ngwedi (Similarity between the Sun and the Moon):** The analogy to the Moon's phases was helpful, but it was the existence of phases at *all* that was the key.



"
Galileo Galilei o ne a bona eng mo go seno se se latelang ka 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Dikarolo tsa Venus**.

The passage states that Galileo observed that Venus had ""two moons, just like the moon."" These ""moons"" were actually phases of Venus, meaning that only a portion of the planet was illuminated at any given time. This observation supported Copernicus's heliocentric theory.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, Noka ya Amazon e tsaya metsi kae?","The correct answer is **A: Dinoka tse dinnye**.

The text states: ""Noka e konokono ya Amazon e boleele jwa dikhilomithara di le 6,387 km (dimmaele di le 3,980). E tsaya metsi a yone go tswa mo dinokaneng tse dinnye di le diketekete.""  This translates to: ""The Amazon river is about 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gets its water from smaller streams and tributaries.""
"
Ke tlotlo efe e e sa newang Noka ya Amazon?,"The correct answer is **C: Ke noka e telele go di feta tsotlhe**

Here's why:

The first sentence of the text states: ""Noka ya Amazon ke noka ya bobedi e telele le e kgolo go gaisa mo Lefatsheng.""  This directly translates to ""The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world."" Therefore, ""telele go di feta tsotlhe"" (longest than all) is the most accurate description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ke noka ya bobedi e telele go di feta tsotlhe** - While technically correct, ""telele go di feta tsotlhe"" is more concise and accurate.
*   **B: Ke noka e kgolo go di feta tsotlhe** - The text states it's the *second* largest, not the largest.
*   **D: Ke noka e e atlhameng thata** - The text provides information about its length and water volume, but nothing about the difficulty of navigating it.



"
Ke tiro efe e go buiwang ka yone mo serapeng seno e e thapang Ba-Venezuela ba le mmalwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Temothuo (Oil)**.

The passage states: ""Kgwebo ya botlhokwa mo bathong ba Venezuela ke lookwane, koo naga e leng yone e romelang lookwane kwa dinageng tse dingwe go gaisa, le fa gone e le peresente e le nngwe fela ya batho e e dirang kwa bodirelong jwa lookwane."" This translates to ""The important trade for Venezuelans is oil, where the country sends oil to other countries to export, although only one percent of people work in the oil industry.""

Therefore, oil is the key industry mentioned that significantly impacts Venezuelans. While other options are mentioned as types of work, oil is highlighted as the *important trade*.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke lefapha lefe mo go a a latelang le le thapang batho ba le bantsi go gaisa mo Venezuela?","The answer is **A: Tirelo (Services)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nngwe-peding ya batho ba kwa Venezuela ba ba dirang ba mo ditirong tsa ditirelo..."" which translates to ""One-fifth of the people working in Venezuela are in the service sector..."" This directly indicates that the service sector employs the largest percentage of people in Venezuela, according to the text.

While other sectors exist, the text highlights the prevalence of the service sector more than any of the others listed.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, go kopana ga dinaledi go dira gore dinaledi di kgone go dira eng?","The correct answer is **A: Dira dilo tse di bokete** (Create useful things).

Here's why:

The question describes nuclear fusion, the process where hydrogen atoms combine to form heavier elements. The text states that scientists are trying to replicate this process to create a powerful source of energy.  The key point is that this process *creates* things, in this case, new, heavier elements, which can then be used for various applications, including energy production.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go aga di-fusion reactor** (Build fusion reactors): This is a *method* of achieving fusion, not what fusion *does*.
* **C: Go ntsha lesedi le mogote** (Produce light and heat): While fusion *does* produce light and heat, this is a *result* of the process, not the primary outcome in terms of what the new elements can *do*.
* **D: Dira diatomo tsa haeterojene** (Create deuterium atoms): This is a specific element involved in fusion, but not the overall outcome or benefit of the reaction.
"
Ke eng se se latelang se se ka dirwang ke motshodi wa nutliliya o o nang le mosola?,"The correct answer is **B: Dinaledi (Elements)**.

Here's why:

* **The question describes nuclear fusion.** Nuclear fusion is the process where light atomic nuclei (like hydrogen) combine to form heavier nuclei, releasing enormous amounts of energy.  This process is how stars generate their energy.
* **The question asks what a fusion reactor produces.** Fusion reactors aim to replicate this process on Earth. The *result* of successful fusion is the creation of *new elements*.
* **Therefore, the correct answer is elements.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hydrogen:** Hydrogen is a fuel for fusion, not a product.
* **C: Diathomo (Atoms):**  While atoms are involved in the process, the outcome is the creation of *new* atoms (different elements).
* **D: Maatla a Motlakase (Electricity):** Electricity is *released* during fusion, but it's not the *product* of the fusion process itself.

"
Metsi a dirilwe ka dikhemikale dife?,"The correct answer is **B: Atomo e le nngwe ya haeterojene le atomo e le nngwe ya okosejene**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kopanyo ya metsi e dirilwe ka athomo e le nngwe ya hydrogen le atomo e le nngwe ya okosejene."" (Water is formed by one atom of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.)

Therefore, option B accurately reflects this information.
"
"Fa metsi a fetoga, ke eng se se tla nnelang ruri?","The correct answer is **A: Sebopego sa dimolekhule (Molecular structure)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a compound's chemical composition remains the same even if its structure changes.  It uses the example of nitrogen gas and liquid nitrogen having the same chemical composition (nitrogen) but different structures.  The question asks what will change when water changes its state. The passage indicates that while the *form* might change, the fundamental *molecular structure* (the arrangement of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms) will remain the same.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Boima (Weight):** Changing state doesn't fundamentally alter the number or type of atoms present, so the weight remains the same.
*   **C: Boemo jwa mmele (Physical state):** This is what's *changing* when water goes from solid (ice) to liquid (water) to gas (steam), but the question asks what is *resulting* from the change, not what the change *is*.
*   **D: Naetherojene e e mo metsing (Nitrogen in water):** Water *doesn't* contain nitrogen. It's composed of hydrogen and oxygen.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e neng e se bothata mo dinageng tse di lesome le boraro fa di ne di leka go tlhoma melao e e rileng?","The correct answer is **B: Go tlhoka maatla mo Kongereng (A lack of power in Congress)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Palamente e ne e sena maatla ape a go batla lekgetho..."" (Congress had no power to enforce laws...). This lack of power in Congress is directly linked to the difficulty in creating effective laws.  The passage goes on to explain how this powerlessness stemmed from the Articles of Confederation's structure, which lacked the ability to levy taxes, raise a national army, or effectively change laws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Puso e dira ka natla go laola dilo (The government acts decisively to control things):** The passage indicates the opposite - the government was *unable* to act decisively.
* **C: Diphetogo tse di tlhokang go amogelwa ka bongwefela jwa pelo (Changes that need to be accepted wholeheartedly):** While consensus was difficult, the passage doesn't say changes *needed* to be accepted wholeheartedly.  The problem was achieving consensus at all.
* **D: Puso ya bosetšhaba e e sa nneng teng (There was no national government):** The passage implies a national government *did* exist (the Articles of Confederation), but it was weak and powerless.  The problem wasn't the *absence* of a government, but the *weakness* of the one in place.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke polelo efe e e bontshang sentle boemo jwa puso ya bogare ka nako ya Ntwa ya Kgololesego?","The correct answer is **C: Baemedi ba puso ba ne ba seyo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditlhogo tseno di ne di tlhoka tumalano ka botlalo ya dinaga tsotlhe pele ga fa e ka felolwa mme naga e ne ya tsaya puso ya bogare botsatsa tota mo e leng go re baemedi ba yone go le ga ntsi ba ne sa nne teng."" 

This translates to: ""These heads required unanimous agreement of all states before it could be resolved and the nation had a purely federal government where its executives were not many.""

This directly indicates that the executive branch (the government's leaders) was weak and lacked power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Makgetho a ne a patelediwa ke Congress le balaodi ba puso** (The departments were supervised by Congress and the government officials): The passage describes the *lack* of effective departments and the difficulty in governance, not their supervision.
* **B: Diphetogo tse di neng di dirwa mo Ditemaneng di ne di ikaegile ka taolo ya Kongerese** (The changes that were made in the Departments were independent of Congressional control): The passage emphasizes the *lack* of Congressional control, the opposite of what this option states.
* **D: Puso e kgolo e ne e na le dikarolo tse pedi tsa konokono** (The large government had two branches of government): The passage describes a *weak* central government, not a large one with distinct branches.



"
Mafoko a a mo morago ga Maiphako a Kgololesego a kwadilwe jang?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka mokwalo o monnye**.

The text states: ""Go ne go kwadile mafoko a a reng, """"Maikano a kwa Tshimologong a Boipuso a a kwadilweng ka di-4 tsa Phukwi 1776"""" ka fa morago ga Maikano a Boipuso."" This translates to ""The words that were written were, 'The Declaration of Independence, adopted on the 4th of July 1776,' after the Declaration of Independence.""  The phrase ""mafoko a a reng"" means ""words that were written"".  The context implies it was written in a standard script (mokwalo o monnye).
"
Singapore e itsege ka eng mo go tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Metshameko ya bogatlhamelamasisi (Pride of nation)**.

The text states that Vanda Miss Joaquim was chosen to be the national flower of Singapore, implying it became a source of national pride.
"
Vanda Miss Joaquim ke eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Lelomo la bosechaba la naga.**

The text explicitly states: ""Ka 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, lelomo la kwa tshimologong la orchid le ne la tlhophiwa go nna lelomo la bosechaba la naga."" which translates to ""In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a orchid from Singapore, was chosen to be the national flower of the country.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke nonofo efe ya Mantswe a kwa Giza e Baegepeto ba Bogosi jo Bosha ba neng ba sa e rate?","The correct answer is **D: Go agiwa ga tsone** (Their construction).

Here's why:

The passage states that the pyramids of Giza were so massive and built with such advanced engineering that even the powerful New Kingdom of Egypt was awed by them. The question asks what aspect of the pyramids the New Kingdom *didn't* appreciate. Given the context of the passage emphasizing the complexity of their construction, the New Kingdom wouldn't have been able to replicate or understand the **construction** methods used.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bogolo** (Their size): They were clearly impressed by their size.
* **B: Go dirisa leje** (The use of stone): While they used stone, it's not stated they didn't appreciate that.
* **C: Bogolo jwa tsone** (Their grandeur): The passage implies they were impressed by the pyramids' grandeur.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ditshedi tse di jang dimela di tsamaya di tswa kae go ya go batla dipula?","The correct answer is **A: Dithota tse di kwa bokone (Eastern hills)**.

The passage states: ""Ngwaga le ngwaga ka Diphalane diphologolo tse di jang dimela di le dimilione di le 1.5 di tsaya mosepele go ela kwa dipoeng tse di kwa borwa, ... go tswa kwa dithoteng tse di kwa bokone di latelela dipula.""  This translates to: ""Year after year, millions of herbivores migrate to the eastern areas, ... coming from the eastern hills to follow the rains.""
"
"Go ya ka temana eno, diphologolo tse di jang ditlhare le bojang di tswa mo lefelong lefe ka kgwedi ya Moranang?","The correct answer is **D: Lefelo la Diphologolo la Maasai Mara**.

The text states: ""Go tswa fo di boela gape kwa bokone di feta ka fa bophirima, di tshela gape noka ya Mara, morago ga dipula ka kgwedi ya Moranang."" (They also return from the north, crossing to the west, and again live in the Mara Valley, after the rains by a week of Moranang.)  The Mara Valley is part of the Maasai Mara National Reserve.
"
Operation Sealion e ne e le tlhaselo ya naga efe?,"The correct answer is **A: Jeremane**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jeremane ya simolola go ipaakanyetsa go tlhasela setlhaketlhake sa Boritane. Jeremane e ne ya bitsa tlhaselo eo """"Operation Sealion""""."" which translates to ""Germany began to prepare to invade Britain. Germany called that invasion """"Operation Sealion"""".""
"
Jeremane e ne ya bitsa tlhaselo eo ya kwa Boritane jang?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jeremane e ne ya bitsa tlhaselo eo """"Operation Sealion"""". "" which translates to ""Germany called that invasion ""Operation Sealion"""".
"
Ke eng se se sa umakiwang e le kgato e e tlhokegang mo thulaganyong ya Italy ya go gapa dinaga tsa Aforika?,"The correct answer is **A: Go fedisa mafelo a dikepe kwa Egepeto.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kwa ntlha ya seo, ba ile ba tshwanelwa ke go fedisa mafelo a masole le dikepe tsa Borithane kwa Egepeto."" (Because of that, they had to destroy the enemy's armies and ships in Egypt.) The passage indicates this was a necessary step *before* Italy could effectively explore African territories.

The other options are not directly linked as a *necessary* step for Italy to gain access to African lands, according to the text.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, boikaelelo jo bogolo jwa ntwa ya Italy e ne e le bofe?","The correct answer is **A: Go gapa mafatshe a Aferika**.

The passage states: ""Maikaelelo magolo a Italy e ne e le dinaga tsa Aforika."" which translates to ""The main ambition of Italy was the African lands.""

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the information provided in the text.
"
Ke bomang ba ba neng ba dira botsalano le batlhasedi?,"The correct answer is **B: Bafora ba Vichy**.

The passage states: ""Bano e ne e le batho ba Mafora ba ba ileng ba dira kagiso le Majeremane ka 1940 mme bo ba dirisana le batlhasedi go na le go re ba ba lwantshe."" This translates to: ""They were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had collaborated with the occupiers, meaning they fought them.""  Therefore, the French Vichy government (who collaborated with the Germans) were the ones who made the agreement with the Germans.
"
"""Ke bomang ba Balekane ba ba neng ba nna le seabe mo """"Operation Dragoon?""""""","The correct answer is **A: Baamerika le Bafora ba ba Gololesegileng**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ka 15 Phatwe 1940, Dinaga tse di Ikgolagantseng di ne tsa tlhasela borwa jwa Fora, tlhaselo eo e ne ya bidiwa """"Operation Dragoon"""". Mo dibekeng tse pedi fela masole a Baamerika le Mafora a a Gololesegileng a ne a golotse borwa jwa Fora mme a ya ntlheng ya Jeremane.""
"
Ke thekenoloji efe e e neng ya dira gore dikepe tsa kafa tlase ga metsi di simolole go tsamaya kafa tlase ga metsi?,"The correct answer is **B: Lefelo la go thuntsha (Submerging method)**.

The passage states: ""Kwa tshimologong ya ntwa jwa Lefatshe ya Ntlha le ya Bobedi, dikepe tsa ka fa tlase ga lewatle di ne di sa kgone go thunyetsa kgakala.""  This indicates that the ability to submerge (go thuntsha) was a key technological advancement that allowed them to operate underwater. While U-Boats were a specific type, the fundamental technology enabling underwater travel was the method of submerging.
"
"Ka nako ya fa dikepe tse di tsamayang kafa tlase ga metsi di ne di dirisiwa lekgetlho la ntlha, di ne di kgona go fofa ka selekanyo se se lekanyeditsweng mo karolong efe?","The correct answer is **C: Go thunya (To submerge)**.

The passage states: ""Kwa tshimologong ya ntwa jwa Lefatshe la Ntlha le ya Bobedi, bontsi jwa sebaka di ne di tsamaya mo godimo ga lewatle, mme fa didiriswa tsa go tsibosa di simolola go tlhabololwa le go nepa dilo le go feta, dikepe tsa ka fa tlase ga lewatle di ne tsa patelesega go ya kwa tlase ga metsi go tila go re di seka tsa bonwa.""

This translates to: ""In the beginning of the First and Second World Wars, most of the area sailed above sea level, and when diving mechanisms started to develop and things went further, submarines began to descend underwater so that they were no longer visible.""

Therefore, the primary action of the submarines was to **submerge** (go thunya).
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a tlola tumalano? ","The correct answer is **D: Masoviet**.

The passage states: ""...Soviet Union...entered Belarus and Ukraine, and then occupied the northern part of Poland, **forced the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non Aggression Pact, and other agreements**...""

This clearly indicates the Soviet Union (Masoviet) was the one who dictated the terms of the treaties.
"
Ke eng mo go tse di latelang se se neng sa se ka sa dirwa ke Sesole se Sehibidu?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tlhamiwa ga karolo ya Ukraine (Annexation of parts of Ukraine)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Soviet Union's actions were primarily focused on regaining territory in eastern Poland and securing borders in Belarus and Ukraine *after* they had already invaded Poland. While the Soviet Union *did* eventually annex parts of Ukraine, the passage doesn't directly link this to the initial events described.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Go tlhasela dikgaolo tsa kwa botlhaba (Occupying northern territories):** The passage *does* mention the Soviet Union occupying the northern territories of Poland.
* **C: Go rulaganngwa seša go bapa le tlhogo ya borogo (Quickly stop the invasion):** The Soviet Union's entry wasn't a quick stop; it was a significant military intervention.
* **D: Go tlola kgolagano (Establishing cooperation):** The Soviet Union's actions were aggressive and aimed at control, not cooperation.

Therefore, the answer that is *least* supported by the passage is the annexation of Ukraine. The passage focuses on their actions within Poland and the immediate aftermath, and doesn't mention Ukraine annexation as an initial or primary goal.
"
Go ne ga direga eng ka Moenjenere yo Mogolo wa Sesole sa Bosome sa Italy?,"The correct answer is **A: O ne a tshwarwa kwa Fort Capuzzo**.

The text states: ""Mo tlhaselong ko bophirima jwa Bardia, ba Britain ba thopile mogolwane wa tsa bo engineer wa sesole sa Italy, General Lastucci. **O ne a tshwarwa kwa Fort Capuzzo**..."" (In the vicinity west of Bardia, the British troops captured the Italian army's engineer general, General Lastucci. He was stationed at Fort Capuzzo...).
"
Italo Balbo o ne a bolawa kae?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Seetebosigo a le 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Tonakgolo wa Libya a a bileng gape e le motlhatlhami wa ga Mussolini, o ne a bolawa ke ba ga gabo fa a goroga kwa **Toburk**.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mekgwa efe e e latelang e e leng karolo ya botlhokwa ya go tlhatlhanya ga Setibetan?","The correct answer is **A: Dithuthuntsho tsa go hema (Yoga ya Kundalini)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka “Yoga” ya Kundalini, maatla a kundalini, (maatla a tshedimosetso), a a tsosolosang boemo jwa mmele, **dithuthuntsho tsago hema**, maikanopoelelo le ponatshego.""  This directly links yoga kundalini to the development of spiritual experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go boeletsa melaetsa (Receiving messages):** While spiritual experiences might *include* receiving messages, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as a core component of Tibetan healing.
* **C: Go bona medimo ka leitlho la mogopolo (Seeing deities in a visionary way):**  The passage mentions seeing deities as a result of meditation, but the central focus is on the physical and spiritual transformation facilitated by yoga kundalini.
* **D: Go ithuta go dira yoga (Learning to do yoga):**  The passage refers to *Yoga ya Kundalini*, which is a specific type of yoga, not just learning any kind of yoga. Therefore, ""dithuthuntsho tsa go hema"" is more precise.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, di-chakra di tshubiwa jang ka nako ya go tlhatlhanya ga Setibet?","The correct answer is **A: Ka go dirisa mekgwa e e farologaneng ya yoga**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Tibetan Buddhism incorporates aspects of Indian yoga, specifically mentioning Kundalini Yoga. The passage links the practice of yoga with the activation of chakras. Therefore, the most logical answer is that chakras are stimulated through various yoga techniques.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka go akanya ka medimo:** While meditation is part of Tibetan Buddhism, the passage focuses on the physical practice of yoga and chakras.
*   **C: Go boaboeletsa medumo:** This option is unrelated to the passage's content.
*   **D: Dithuthuntsho tsa go hema:** While physical postures (asanas) are part of yoga, the passage indicates a broader application of yoga principles, not just physical postures.



"
Ke mang yo o neng a opela pina ya bobedi ya boineelo ka nako ya thulaganyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Lakkha Singh**.

The passage states: ""Lakka Singh o ne a tsaya ketapelo mo go opelweng ga difela."" This translates to ""Lakkha Singh was reciting a prayer during the celebrations.""  Since the question asks who performed the *second* devotional song, and Lakka Singh was reciting a prayer during the celebrations, it implies he was performing a devotional song.  The passage specifically mentions him reciting ""chhappan bhog bhajan,"" a type of devotional song.

While Sanju Sharma and Raju Khandelwal are mentioned as performers, it doesn't state specifically that they were performing a *second* devotional song. Jai Shankar Choudhary is mentioned as following Sanju Sharma. Therefore, Lakkha Singh is the most likely answer.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a opela pina ya boineelo fa go ne go ntshiwa dijo?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lakka Singh o ne a tsaya ketapelo mo go opelweng ga difela."" which translates to ""Lakkha Singh was chanting prayers during the distribution of food.""
"
Tiragalo ya bofelo ya maitseboa e ne e le efe?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina le Haris Alexiou**.

The text explicitly states: ""Seopedi segolo sa lefatshe la Turkey **Sezen Aksu** o diragaditse le seopedi sa Italy sa lentswe la tinoro le se se tswang **Greek, Gerika Haris Alexiou**.""

Options B, C, and D refer to other elements mentioned in the text (Fire of Anatolia, Whirling Dervishes, Fatih Erkoç & Müslüm Gürses) but not the specific vocalists listed as performing.
"
Alessandro Safina ke wa morafe ofe?,"The correct answer is **D: Moitaly**.

The text states that Alessandro Safina is an Italian tenor.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a seng boammaaruri?","The correct answer is **A: Go ne ga nna le molelo kwa Santa Clara** (There was no sound in Santa Clara).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states, ""Letsatsi la teng, go ne go le mogote thata ko Santa Clara."" (That day, there was a loud noise in Santa Clara.) This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options are likely true based on the text:

* **B: Batho ba ne ba tshwareletse mo koloing ya roller coaster.** (People were waiting in the roller coaster car.) The passage says people were waiting *under* the roller coaster, implying they were waiting to ride.
* **C: Bapalami ba ne ba neelwa metsi.** (Riders were given water.) The text directly states, ""Bapalami ba ne ba neelwa metsi fa ba ne ba letile mo mogoteng..."" (Riders were given water when they were tired in the heat...)
* **D: Go ne ga tsaya metsotso e feta masome a marataro (60) go ntsha motho wa ntlha mo koloing.** (It took over sixty minutes to rescue a person from the car.) The passage says, ""Go tsere ura go ntsha motho wa ntlha mo go yone."" (It took an hour to rescue a person from it.) While it says ""hour"" (ura), an hour is more than 60 minutes.



Therefore, the only false statement is that there was no noise in Santa Clara.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a akgela ka mogote o o feteletseng?","The correct answer is **C: Bapalami**.

The passage states: ""Bapalami ba ne ba neelwa metsi fa ba ne ba letile mo mogoteng..."" which translates to ""The riders were given water when they got out of the water ride...""

The passage also mentions Scott Kouns, the ""mogolwane wa batima-molelo"" (safety manager), describing the conditions. 

Therefore, the riders (bapalami) were the ones who were affected by the extreme heat.

Ke kae koo go neng ga kgaolwa motlakase gone ka ntlha ya tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The passage states: ""Go ne go na le kgaogo ya motlakase ka nakwana, e go begilweng e kganetse bagolwane ba Tonga go amogela tlhagiso ya tsunami e e ntshitsweng ke PTWC."" which translates to ""There was a significant power surge that allowed the people of Tonga to receive the tsunami warning issued by PTWC.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, Tonga e ne ya amiwa jang ke go tima motlakase?","The correct answer is **C: Dipalo tsa lewatle di ne tsa amega** (Sea levels were unusual).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go ne go na le kgaogo ya motlakase ka nakwana, e go begilweng e kganetse bagolwane ba Tonga go amogela tlhagiso ya tsunami e e ntshitsweng ke PTWC."" This translates to: ""There was a significant power outage, which prompted Tongan authorities to heed the tsunami warning issued by PTWC.""

The preceding sentence mentions unusual sea level readings (""Go ya ka dikgang tsa sesheng, dipalo tsa selekanyo sa metsi a lewatle di kaile fa setsuatsue sa Tsunami se ne se dirilwe."").  The power outage was a *result* of these unusual sea levels. Therefore, the most logical connection, as stated in the passage, is that unusual sea levels prompted the power outage, and ultimately the warning was heeded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ne ga begiwa gore go na le tshenyo e e rileng** (It wasn't believed there was a strong earthquake): The passage doesn't say whether or not an earthquake was believed to have occurred.
* **B: Balaodi ga ba a ka ba utlwa sepe ka go tlosiwa ga ditlhagiso** (What did the authorities hear when the warning was issued?): The passage doesn't specify what the authorities heard. It says they heeded the warning.
* **D: Balaodi ba ne ba sa kgone go amogela tsiboso tse di maleba** (The authorities couldn't receive further information): The passage doesn't say authorities couldn't receive further information. They *did* receive information about the tsunami.



"
Ke leng mapodisi a neng a kgona go dirisa ditlhobolo tsa one tsa lenaka le le balang bofefo  go bona gore Jonny Reid o kgweetsa ka lobelo lo lo kana kang?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa a ntse a kgweetsa ka dikhilomithara di feta 160 ka oura.**

The passage states that the police used radar to determine how fast Jonny Reid was going. They initially had trouble because he was going at a very high speed, but eventually, they were able to determine his speed was over 160 km/h. The radar is the tool used to measure speed, and the text specifically mentions they slowed him down *after* determining he was going over 160 km/h.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke ka ntlha yang fa go ne go le thata gore mapodisi a kwa New Zealand a kgone go laola lobelo lwa ga Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: O ne a kgweetsa ka lebelo le le kwa tlase ga dikilometara di le 160 ka ura.**

Here's why: The passage explicitly states that the police had trouble controlling Jonny Reid's speed *because* he was driving at a very high speed (approximately 270 km/h). The police were only able to get him to reduce his speed to 160 km/h.  The other options are not directly supported by the text:

* **B: Koloi e ne e le kwa tlase thata:** The text doesn't say the car was difficult to maneuver.
* **C: O ne a kgweetsa ka koloi go kgabaganya borogo makgetlho a le supa fela:**  The passage mentions he was driving *fast* and making dangerous maneuvers, not specifically that he was only making sharp turns.
* **D: Borogo jwa Boemakepe jwa Auckland bo tsofetse thata:** The text doesn't mention anything about the Auckland bridge being difficult.



"
Thoromo ya lefatshe e ne e le fa kae fa e bapisiwa le Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: Dikhilomithara di le 40 kwa borwa**.

The text states: ""Thoromo ya lefatshe e ne e remeletse sekgele sa dikhilomithara tse 20 (dimaele tse 15), kwa bokone-bokone-botlhaba jwa Dillion, dikhilomithara tse 65 (maele tse 40) mo borwa jwa Butte.""  This means the earthquake was 65 kilometers *north* of Butte.
"
Go ne ga direga eng ka nako ya ditshupetso?,"The correct answer is **A: Kgokgontsho ya magolegwa** (The torture of prisoners).

The question asks what *happened* during the time of the abuses. The passage states the Abu Ghraib scandal was revealed *after* the torture of prisoners was seen. Therefore, the torture itself was happening during that time.
"
Ke ka ntlha yang fa kgolegelo ya Iraq e ne ya tuma thata jaana? ,"The correct answer is **A: E ne ya fisiwa (It was concealed/covered up)**.

Here's why:

The question asks *why* the Abu Ghraib scandal gained notoriety. The provided text states it was ""fisitswe ka nako ya ditshupetso"" which means it was concealed or covered up during a period of secrecy. This concealment is the primary reason it gained notoriety – the fact that the abuse was being hidden was a major part of the problem.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Masole a Amerika a ne a tsaya marapo (American soldiers had just established a base):** While the base establishment is a detail of the context, it doesn't directly explain *why* the scandal became widely known.
* **C: Go ne ga nna le ditshupetso (There were operations):**  This is too general.  The text mentions operations but doesn't link them to the scandal's notoriety.
* **D: Go ribololwa ga kgokgontsho ya magolegwa (The leaking of information about the abuse):** While leaking *contributed* to its notoriety, the *reason* it gained notoriety was due to the initial concealment/covering up.  The leaking was a result of the concealment being exposed.



Therefore, the concealment/covering up is the key element in why the scandal gained notoriety.
"
Go ne go tlile go tshwarwa tiragalo ya mofuta ofe kwa War Memorial Stadium ya Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Maitiso a mmino**. 

The question states clearly that the band was supposed to perform at the Maui War Memorial, and that they were requesting accommodation for 9000 people for the concert.
"
Ke mang yo kgabagare a neng a tlhalosa gore ke ka ntlha yang fa tiragalo eno e ile ya phimolwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Setheo se se okametseng botsamaisi**.

The passage states: ""Setheo se se okametseng botsamaisi ja setlhopha sa HK Management Inc, ga se a fa tlhaloso ko tshimologong fa ba emisa ka Lwetse a le 20..."" This directly indicates that the management spokesperson offered an explanation (or lack thereof) regarding the cancellation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Setlhopha (The band):** The passage mentions the band, but it's *their spokesperson* who provided the statement.
* **C: Mong wa War Memorial Stadium (War Memorial Stadium Manager):**  The passage doesn't mention the stadium manager at all.
* **D: Balatedi (Ticketholders):** While the event was for 9000 ticketholders, the spokesperson's statement is about the cancellation, not the ticketholders' reaction or understanding.



"
Baagi ba le mmalwa ba Bishkek ba ne ba akanya gore ke mang yo o neng a dira tiro eno?,"The correct answer is **D: Badiraditshupetso ba ba tswang kwa Borwa**.

The text states: ""Baagi ba le mmalwa ba Bishbek ba ne ba pega badiraditshupetso ba ba tswang kwa borwa molato ka ntlha ya botlhokatsebe"". This translates to ""A few residents of Bishkek blamed the perpetrators who came from the south.""
"
Ke mang yo o neng a pega babopeledi ba kwa borwa molato wa go utswa dilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Baagi ba Bishkek**.

The passage states: ""Baagi ba le mmalwa ba Bishbek ba ne ba pega badiraditshupetso ba ba tswang kwa borwa molato ka ntlha ya botlhokatsebe..."" which translates to ""A few Bishkek residents were arresting suspects coming from the south due to their recklessness...""
"
Ring e ne ya oketsa dithekiso leng?,"The correct answer is **C: Morago ga go tlhagelela mo QVC**.

The text states: ""Ring e ne gape, ya duela kompone e e phadisanyang le yone ya tsa itshireletso, ADT Corporation, e e neng e e sekisitse ka fa molaong. **Siminoff o ne a tlhagelela mo thelebishening ya tsa theko mo chaneleng ya QVC.**"" This indicates that pitching on QVC was a key factor in Ring's sales growth. While other options might be related to Ring's history, the text specifically links QVC to their sales success.
"
Jamie Siminoff o ne a swetsa leng go simolola Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa a sena go lemoga gore tshitswana e e kokotang,ya lebentlele, e ne e sa utlwale.**

The text explicitly states: ""Mo nakong e e fetileng, mookamedi wa Ring, Jamie Siminoff, o ne a tshwaela fa kompone e simolodisitswe fa tshitswana e e kokotang ya lebentlele e ne e sa utlwale fa a le ko mabeelong a dikoloi."" (In the past, Ring's founder, Jamie Siminoff, was frustrated because the doorbell camera didn't work when he was in his car.)

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the text does not mention Shark Tank, seeing money, or a QVC appearance as the initial trigger for starting Ring. These events happened later in Ring's history.
"
Kgaolo nngwe le nngwe ya Reading Rainbow e ne e naya bana dikatlageniso tsa eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Dibuka**.

The passage states: ""Kgaolo nngwe le nngwe ya tshupegetso e, e itebaganya le moono o o mo bukeng nngwe..."" which translates to ""Each episode of the show is based on a book..."" and later ""...e ntsha kaelo ya dibuka tse bana ba ka di batlang fa ba ya ko motlobong wa dibuka wa bone,"" meaning ""...promotes books that children might want to find at their local library.""
"
"""Ke eng se se ka tswang se bakile gore go phimolwe motseletsele wa """"Reading Rainbow""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Madi a a sa lekaneng (Insufficient funding)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bangwe, ba ba akaretsang John Grant, ba dumela go re go fokodiwa ga madi a a abelwang bagasi, ga mmogo le go fetola megopolo ka go re kgaso ya dithulaganyo tsa thuto e tshwanetse go nna jang, go nnile le seabe mo go emisiweng ga thulaganyo e."" This translates to: ""Others, including John Grant, believe that the reduction in funding allocated to broadcasters, along with changes in programming because the budget for educational amounts should be, was a factor in the show's cancellation.""

While the show *did* win Emmy awards (B) and John Grant's opinions (C) were important, the primary reason cited for the cancellation is the lack of funding.  ""Katlego ya Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" (D) is mentioned as a comparable show, but not as a reason for the cancellation of *Reading Rainbow*.



"
Ke ntlha efe mo go tse di latelang e e neng e sa ganediwe ke badiredi ba kwa Amsterdam le ba musiamo malebana le setlhare?,"The correct answer is **D: Go kotsi mo boitekanelong jwa batho (It's dangerous for public safety)**.

The passage states that the authorities were concerned about the danger the diary posed to public safety, which is why they decided to remove it. The other options are not mentioned or supported by the text.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ruri e tla wa (It will fall):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the diary falling.
* **B: E tshwanetse go bolokiwa (It should be preserved):** This is the opposite of what the authorities decided to do.
* **C: E kgotletswe ke mouta (It should be kept by a child):** There's no mention of children or the diary being kept by a child.
"
"Go ya ka motlhatlhobi yo mogolo wa RSPCA, ditlhatlhobo di tshwanetse go nna selo se se tlwaelegileng mo go dife tsa dilo tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **C: Go tsenngwa ga dikhamera tsa go lebelela (Installation of CCTV cameras)**.

The question asks where the installation of CCTV cameras should be commonplace, according to the RSPCA. The text explicitly states that the RSPCA believes the installation of CCTV cameras in animal shelters should be the norm in Australia.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se ka thusang go gatelela kafa go leng botlhokwa ka teng gore badiri ba kwa mafelong a go bolaelwang diphologolo kwa go one kwa Australia ba tlhokomele diphologolo?","The correct answer is **A: Go tsenya dikhamera tsa CCTV (Installing CCTV cameras)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mogolwane wa dikanoko wa RSPCA New South Wales David O'Shannessy o boleletse ba ABC gore go tlhoma matlho le go kanoka ga matlhabelo e tshwanetse go nna selomodiro mo Australia. Kwantle ga pelaelo CCVT e romela molaetsa o o bogale kwa bathong ba ba berekang ka diphologolo gore botsogo jwa bone bo botlhokwa thata.""  This directly links the installation of CCTV cameras to deterring cruelty and emphasizing the importance of animal welfare.

The other options are less directly supported by the passage:

*   **B: Dipokano tse di patelesegang le RSPCA (Video conferences with RSPCA)**: While important for discussion and reporting, the passage doesn't highlight this as a preventative measure.
*   **C: Ditlhatlhobo tsa ka metlha tsa matlhapelo (Improved humane trapping methods)**: The passage doesn't mention trap improvements.
*   **D: Tlhokomelo ya ABC (ABC coverage)**: While ABC is reporting on the issue, the coverage itself doesn't deter cruelty.

Therefore, installing CCTV cameras is the action directly presented as a deterrent in the passage."
"Go ya ka serapa, motho yo o neng a tshwarwa o ne a dira tiro efe?","The correct answer is **A: Moithuti (Student)**.

The passage states: ""mongwe yo o neng a amana le go thuntsha tlhobolo kwa sekolong ka Mopitlwe 21, o tshwarwe."" This translates to ""one who had a connection to sending a bomb to school on February 21st, was arrested."" And later mentions ""Louis Jourdain, son of Red Lake Tribal Chairman, Floyd Jourdain, age 16.""  The context indicates Louis Jourdain was a student involved in the school bombing incident.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, fa go ntse go anamisiwa dikgang tsa go tshwarwa gape, go ne go tshwerwe diphitlho tsa batho ba le kae?","The correct answer is **C: Robongwe**.

The passage states: ""dikgang tsa ga Jeff Weise le batswa-setlhabelo ba bararo mo go ba le robongwe di ne di tshwerwe..."" which translates to ""the charges against Jeff Weise and the three victims who were killed in the massacre were scheduled..."".
"
Ke naga efe e e neng ya se ka ya tswelela pele ka tumalano ya yone ya ACTA e e neng ya saenwa ka ntlha ya ditshupetso?,"The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko kgweding e e fitileng go ne go na le bangongoregi ko Poland fa lefatshe leo le dumelana ka mokwalo le ACTA, se se ne sa gogela ko go reng puso ya Poland e tseye tshweetso go sa baakanya tumelano le gompieno.""  This means Poland took action to withdraw from the agreement.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dinaga tse di latelang e e neng ya swetsa ka gore e busetse morago thulaganyo ya go nna leloko la ACTA?","The answer is **D: Latvia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Latvia le Slovakia ka bobedi ba diile tsamaiso ya go inaakanya le ACTA."" This directly indicates that Latvia rejected the ACTA framework.  The question asks which country *switched* (meaning rejected) the framework, and Latvia is explicitly mentioned as having done so.
"
Ke batho ba le kae ba ba neng ba gobala ka ntlha ya ditiragalo tsa go gotela ga di-iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: Bone (People)**.

The text states: ""Le tlogela batho ba ka nna nne ka dikgobalo tse di seng masisi tsa molelo."" which translates to ""Causing injuries to as many as four people with minor injuries."" Therefore, ""bone"" (people) is the correct answer.
"
Ke mang yo o neng a re ditiragalo tsa go gotela thata ga di masisi?,"The correct answer is **A: METI**.

The passage states: ""Lephata la Itsholelolo, Papadi le Madirelo la kwa Japane (METI) le buile fa le itse ka dikotsi di le masome a mabedi le bosupa (27) tse di amanngwang le didirisiwa tsa teng."" This translates to ""The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said that it knew of twenty-two safety concerns and 27 reports related to their use.""
"
"Ka nako ya puo ya gagwe, Steve Jobs o ne a re Apple e tlile go dira eng gape?","The correct answer is **B: Phounu (Phone)**.

The text states that Steve Jobs announced the iPhone during a presentation and said, ""Today Apple is reinventing the phone.""
"
Boikaelelo jwa puo ya diura tse pedi ya ga Steve Jobs e ne e le bofe?,"The correct answer is **C: Go ribolola founo e ntšhwa**.

The text states that Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone at an event in his personal warehouse.  His quote, ""Today Apple is reinventing the phone,"" clearly indicates he was announcing a new phone.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o ne a itsise eng kwa Theater ya Argentina?,"The correct answer is **B: Maitlhomo a gagwe a go batla go tlhophiwa go nna Senate**.

The passage states: ""Mohumagadi Kirchner o itsisitse ka maikaelelo a gagwe a go emela maemo a bo tautona kwa lefelo la bodiragatsi la Argentine, e bong lefelo le a le dirisitseng go simolola ipapatso ya gagwe ka 2005, **go nna leloko la Senate, e le moemedi wa porofense ya Buenos Aires**."" This indicates that she was campaigning to become a Senator.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o ne a itsise kae gore o batla go tsenela bosole?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwa bo bogelong jo bo dikilometara di le 31 go tswa kwa La Plata**.

The text states: ""Mohumagadi Kirchner o itsisitse ka maikaelelo a gagwe a go emela maemo a bo tautona kwa lefelo la bodiragatsi la Argentine, e bong lefelo le a le dirisitseng go simolola ipapatso ya gagwe ka 2005, go nna leloko la Senate, e le moemedi wa porofense ya Buenos Aires.""  It then specifies that this location is ""go tswa kwa Buenos Aires.""  This means it is 31 miles *from* La Plata, which is near Buenos Aires. Option A correctly reflects this.
"
ACMA e ne ya lemoga eng malebana le Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **B: Go ne ga fitlhelwa gore tshedimosetso ya mmedia e beilwe mo tsebeng ya inthanete ya Big Brother.**

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Big Brother e ne e sa tlola melao ya kanamiso kitso ya mo inthaneteng e re ka tshedimosetso ya mmedia e ne e sa bewa mo tsebeng ya inthanete ya Big brother.""  This translates to ""Big Brother was not complying with internet content regulation regarding media content being published on its internet platform.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ne go sa tlolwa melao ya kanamiso kitso ya mo inthaneteng:** While true, this is a general statement and not the specific focus of ACMA's observation regarding Big Brother.
* **C: Go ne go tlotswe melao ya go thibela batho go dira dilo dingwe:** The text doesn't mention any violations of laws prohibiting specific actions by people.
* **D: Go ne ga fitlhelwa gore diteng di ne di nna mo sedirisiweng sengwe:** This option is not directly supported by the text.



"
Metswedi ya tshedimosetso e tshwanetse go nna le ditekanyetso dife gore e tsewe e le diteng tsa Inthanete?,"The correct answer is **A: E tshwanetse ya bo e le mo Inthaneteng (It must be on the Internet)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Molao wa Tsa Tirelo ya Kgaso o neelana ka molawana wa diteng tsa Inthanete...mme o tshwanetse go tsewa e le diteng tsa Inthanete, mme o tshwanetse go bolokwa mo sefareng."" (The Broadcasting Act provides for the regulation of online content...and it must be considered as online content, and it must be monitored online).

Therefore, the defining characteristic of online content, according to the passage, is that it *must* be on the internet.  Options B, C, and D are incorrect based on the information provided.
"
Ke mang moeteledipele wa Mokgatlho wa Liberal wa Australia?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text explicitly states: ""Rre Peter Costello, motshwaramatlotlo wa Australia..."" which translates to ""Mr. Peter Costello, Treasurer of Australia..."" and later identifies him as having succeeded John Howard."
"""Ke ka ntlha yang fa Australia e ise e nne le madirelo a motlakase wa maranyane a """"nuclear""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Go tlhoka tshegetso ya setšhaba (Public support is needed)**.

Here's why:

The passage doesn't state *why* Australia hasn't had nuclear power plants before. It focuses on Peter Costello's argument *for* considering it.  However, his argument is framed around the idea that Australia *should* explore it if it's beneficial for the economy.  Therefore, a key factor in implementing such a project would be public opinion and approval.  The other options don't directly relate to the passage's content:

*   **B: Go ganetsana thata (It's very difficult to oppose):** The passage doesn't discuss opposition.
*   **C: Go kotsi thata (It's very dangerous):** The passage doesn't mention safety concerns.
*   **D: Go ja madi a mantsi thata (It's very expensive):** While nuclear power is expensive, the passage doesn't focus on the cost as a barrier.

Therefore, the most logical inference from Costello's statements is that public support would be a necessary condition for pursuing nuclear power.



"
Ke mothadisi ofe wa ski yo o neng a gaisana a thusiwa ke mokaedi?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Maciej Krezel, **le mokaedi wa gagwe, Anna Ogarzynska**, ba feditse mo maemong a bolesome-le-boraro mo Super-G.""  This directly indicates that Maciej Krezel was skiing with Anna Ogarzynska.
"
Ke naga efe e e neng ya wetsa e le ya bolesome mo kgaisanong ya Super-G ya basadi ba ba emeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Finland**.

The text states: ""le Anna Jochemsen a fetsa mo maemong a borobabongwe mo kgaisanong ya bomme ba ba emeng sentle ya Super-G maabane, **le lefatshe la Finland ka Katja Saarinen a fetsa mo maemong a bolesome mo go yone kgaisano eo.**""  This directly links Finland with Katja Saarinen finishing in a podium position in the women's Super-G competition.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke polelo efe e e seng boammaaruri ka Blake?","The correct answer is **B: O ne a dumela gore ke ene a mo tlhasetseng** (He agreed that he was the one who assaulted him).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Mogasi, yo a neng a tshwarwa kwa lefelong la tiragalo, o ne a ganela tlhaselo..."" (The complainant, who was taken to the scene of the incident, refused the charge...). This directly contradicts option B, which says Blake *agreed* to the assault.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: O ne a tshwarwa kwa lefelong la tiragalo** (He was taken to the scene of the incident) -  The passage explicitly states this.
* **C: O ne a dirisa thobane ka nako ya tlhaselo** (He used a cane during the assault) - The passage states Blake refused the charge and that he used a cane to defend himself.
* **D: O ne a bolela gore go ne ga latlhelwa dibotlolo mo go ene** (He said bottles were thrown at him) - The passage states he used bottles to defend himself, implying bottles were thrown at him.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se latelang se se neng sa se ka sa diragalela Blake?","The correct answer is **B: O ne a tshwarwa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Blake gape o ile a tshwarelwa go leka go sokamisa tsamaiso ya bosiamisi."" This translates to ""Blake was also arrested to try to stop the riot.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ne a bonwa molato wa go sokamisa tshiamiso** (He was seen as the culprit of stopping the riot): The text says he was *arrested* to *stop* the riot, not that he was seen as the culprit.
*   **C: O ne a tlhaselwa ka thobane** (He was shot): There is no mention of him being shot.
*   **D: O ne a bolelelwa gore gongwe o tla isiwa kgolegelong** (He was told he would be released): The text says he was told ""go ne go batla go sa kgonege"" which means ""it was not possible"" that he would be released, implying the opposite.



"
Letlole la Lekgotla la Ditšhaba la go lwantsha go thuthafala ga lefatshe ga le kitla le dirisiwa go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Go fokotsa ditlamorago tsa go thuthafala ga lefatshe.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the UN initiative aims to help countries vulnerable to climate change ""live with and adapt to the consequences.""  Adapting to climate change is directly related to reducing the negative impacts (environmental consequences) of global warming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dijalo tse di farologaneng (Various things):** This is too broad. The passage focuses on climate change adaptation.
* **B: Go tlisetsa dinaga tse di tlhabologang maranyane (Providing small countries with resources):** While the passage mentions using funds for infrastructure and clean water, it's not the *primary* goal of the UN initiative described. The focus is on adaptation.
* **C: Matlo a a sa gogolweng ke metsi (Waterproof houses):** This is just one example of a potential use of funds, not the overall purpose of the initiative.



"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke eng se Lekgotla la Ditšhaba le solofetseng go se boloka?","The correct answer is **A: Madi, ka go abelana maranyane.**

Here's why:

The question asks what the UN pledged to *not* conserve according to the text. The text states the UN pledged to help people survive disasters by conserving:

*   ""go aga matlo a ka se keng a senngwa ke merwalela"" (building homes that aren't easily destroyed by disease)
*   ""go dirisa metsi sentle"" (using clean water)
*   ""le go lema ga mefutafuta"" (planting forests)

The answer options do not include these points. However, option A states ""Madi, ka go abelana maranyane"", which refers to money shared to help, which is not what the text states the UN pledged to conserve, but rather to use. The text says money will be used to build homes, provide clean water and plant forests.

Therefore, A is the best option based on the provided text."
Albert Muchanga o ne a sa umake eng mo go seno se se latelang jaaka sengwe se se neng se sa ntse se tlhoka go dumalanwa ka sone?,"The correct answer is **C: Melawana ya Tshimologo (Tariff regulations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ga re ise re dumalane ka melao ya tlhago le go fokoletswa lekgetho..."" This directly translates to ""We have not yet agreed on tariff regulations and the reduction of tariffs...""

Therefore, tariff regulations are the element that hasn't been agreed upon and is hindering the start of trade negotiations. The other options are mentioned as factors in the context, but the lack of agreement on tariffs is explicitly stated as the sticking point.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke ka ntlha yang fa kgwebo e ka simolola ka kgwedi ya Phukwe?","The correct answer is **A: Letlha la go simolola la Phukwe e ne e le karolo ya maemo a Nigeria a go tsena mo AfCFTA.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""fela popego e re nang le yone e siame go re go ka simololwa kgwebisano ka kgwedi ya Phukwi a tlhola letsatsi 2020"" which translates to ""only because we have a positive momentum that it can be possible to start trade in the week of August 2020.""  This momentum is directly linked to Nigeria's progress in joining the AfCFTA. The passage doesn't say that trade *will* start, just that it's *possible* due to the momentum.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go na le melao ya tlhago** - The passage states they haven't agreed on regulations and customs clearance.
*   **C: E ne ya amogelwa ke mokomišenara wa kgwebo le madirelo wa AU** -  While the Commissioner mentioned Benin, this doesn't directly determine when trade *can* start for Nigeria.
*   **D: Go dumalanwe ka melao ya tshimologo le ditshiamelo tsa lekgetho** - The passage explicitly says they haven't agreed on regulations and customs clearance.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution e ne ya latofatsa badiredibagolo ba thuto ka eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go fetola pego ya Journal-Constitution**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka nako ya sekgele, Jenale ya Kgotlatheomolao ya Atlanta e ne ya phasalatsa pego e e bontshang mathata ka dipoelo tsa teko. ... Hall, ga mmogo le bagogi ba lephata la thuto ba le masome mararo le bone, ba ne ba lebisiwa molato ka ngwagawa 2013.""

This implies the Journal-Constitution was reporting on the issues raised in the law enforcement report and the subsequent looming sanctions.  The implication is they were *following up* on the original report. The options relate to reactions or consequences of the report, not the Journal-Constitution's actions *regarding* the report itself.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e neilweng mo serapeng, ke eng se se neng se sa umakiwe mo pegong ya Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **B: Bosupi jwa gore dipampiri tsa tlhatlhobo di ne di fetotswe.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution article revealed that the standardized test scores were falsified. This is a crucial finding and a key piece of information that was *not* anticipated or expected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go tokafala e kgolo mo dintlheng tsa thuto:** This was *expected* after Hall's recognition and the improved test scores. It wasn't a surprise finding.
* **C: Mofenyi wa 2013 wa National Superintendent of the Year:** While this was an award Hall received, it's not the surprising element revealed in the article about test score manipulation.
* **D: Ditshitshinyo tsa go tlhabolola thuto ya ditoropo:** This is a broad topic and while the article touches on school issues, the specific surprise was the falsified test scores.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke tshedimosetso efe e e itsiweng morago ga go thuntshiwa ga bomo?","The correct answer is **A: Palo ya bofelo ya dikgobalo (The number of lives of the victims)**.

The passage states: ""Dibomo tse dingwe tse tharo di thuntshitse gaufi le dikago tsa puso mo sebakeng sa dioura di le pedi. Dibomo dingwe tsa re palo ya semolao ya baswi ke robedi, mme dipego tsa semolao di tlhomamisa go re batho ba ka tshwara 30 ba ne ba gobala; mme gone palo ya makgaolakgang ga ise e itsiwe.""

This translates to: ""Three other bodies were found near government buildings in a quarry area. Other reports indicate the number of missing people is four, and legal reports confirm that 30 people were abducted; and the number of rescuers is not yet known.""

The question asks for the known conclusion *after* the bodies were found. While the passage mentions the number of missing people (4) and abducted people (30), it explicitly states a *known* conclusion related to the bodies themselves: the number of lives lost. Options B, C, and D are details mentioned but not presented as the primary conclusion drawn *after* the discovery of the bodies. The discovery of the bodies directly leads to knowing the number of lives lost.



"
"Fa e sale a tsena mo Manchester City ka 2017, Jesus o tshamekile metshameko e le kae?","The correct answer is **A: 24**.

The question asks how many goals Jesus scored *after* joining Manchester City in 2017. The text states: ""...a nosa dinno di le mosome a mabedi le bone (24)."" which translates to ""...he scored twenty-four goals.""
"
Jesu o ne a amogela madi a a kana ka diranta di le dimilione di le 27 gore a nne leloko la setlhopha sefe?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The text states: ""Jesus wa dingwaga di le 21 o tsene mo setlhopeng sa Manchester City ngwaga o fetileng ka January 2017..."" (Jesus was 21 years old when he joined Manchester City last year in January 2017...)
"
Ke polelo efe e e seng boammaaruri ka baeng ba lefelo la bonno?,"The correct answer is **A: Baeng ba ne ba le kwa Mecca go ya go dira boikhutso (People were in Mecca to perform pilgrimage)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Hosetele e ne ya phutlhama kwa motse o o boitshepo wa Islam wa Mecca ka nako ya losome (ya gone ko Mecca), mosong ono.""  This translates to ""The camels were crowded in the holy city of Mecca during the pilgrimage (during the month of Ramadan), that month.""
* **The purpose of the trip is the pilgrimage (Hajj).**  The other options are directly supported by the text.
* **B: Baeng bangwe e ne e se baagi ba selegae (Some of them were not locals):** The text states many of the pilgrims were from the United Arab Emirates, indicating some were not local.
* **C: Baeng ba ne ba le koo mo letsatsi pele ga hajj (They were there on the first day of Hajj):** The text specifically says they were there on the first day of their second journey.
* **D: Bontsi jwa baeng ba ne ba tswa kwa motseng o o boitshepo (Many of those who came were from a holy city):**  The passage states many pilgrims were from the United Arab Emirates, a holy city.



Therefore, the statement that they were *in Mecca to perform pilgrimage* is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided information.



"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri?","The correct answer is **B: Bontsi jwa baeng ba ne ba tswa kwa United Arab Emirates.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Hosetele e ne e abela balatedi ba sedumedi ba le mmalwa ka boroko ba ba neng ba etetse teropo e boitshepo ka letsatsi la pele ga fa ba tsaya loeto lwa sedumedi la haji. **Bontsi jwa baeti ba hosetele e ne e le baagi ba United Arab Emirates.**"" (The pilgrimage was for a few pilgrims with relatives who had previously visited the holy city on the first day of the second journey of Hajj. **Many of the pilgrims were residents of the United Arab Emirates.**)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Palo ya baswi e ka tshwara 15.** The passage says the number of pilgrims *could* reach 15 kgotsa go feta (or more), but it doesn't say it *can only* reach 15.
* **C: Baeng ba ne ba le koo mo maitseboeng a boikhutso jwa Hajj.** The passage mentions they were going on the second journey of Hajj, but it doesn't specify they were at a training center for Hajj rituals.
* **D: Bontsi jwa baeng e ne e le batho ba selegae Mecca.** The passage states that many were residents of the UAE, not locals of Mecca.



"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke tshedimosetso efe e e ka ikanngwang malebana le go thulana ga dikoloi tseno?","The correct answer is **C: Ditlamorago tsa go thulana ga tsone mo Lefatsheng (The consequences of the collision on Earth).**

Here's why:

The passage heavily emphasizes the potential consequences of the collision on Earth:

* ""Borrasaense ba re go thunya mo go tlhodilweng ke go thulana mo, go ne go boitshega thata."" (Scientists say that the impact was difficult to predict.)
* ""Ba sa leka go sekaseka go re kotsi e e diragetseng e ne e le bogolo jo bo kae, le go re Lefatshe le tsile go amega jang."" (They are trying to assess how large the danger was and how Earth was affected.)
* ""Lekgotla la Amerika la ditogamano tsa Lephata la itshireletso la U.S. le latedisa masalela. Maduo a tshekatsheko a tla tsengwa mo maranyaneng a botlhe."" (The U.S. National Capitol Planetary Defense Council has deployed debris. Investigation teams will be sent to all locations.)

While the size of the object (A) and its speed (B) are mentioned, the *primary focus* is on the *effects on Earth* (C). Option D is too general; while location is mentioned, the consequences are the central concern.



"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke eng se se sa ntseng se tshwanetse go tlhomamisiwa malebana le go thulana ga tsone?","The correct answer is **A: Ke mang yo o tla tlhokomelang go latelwa ga matlakala?**

Here's why:

The passage clearly states that the U.S. Department of Defense is ""delaying the release of debris"" and that ""investigations will be conducted worldwide."" This directly implies that identifying and tracking the debris (and potentially the source of the problem) is a high priority and that people will need to be held accountable for the investigation process.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Disathalaete di ne di tsamaya ka lobelo lo lo kana kang ka nako ya go thulana** - The passage gives a specific speed (17,500 miles per hour), but the question asks for what *needs* to be confirmed, not just what is stated.
*   **C: Tsela e dipholo tsa tshekatsheko ya dipolane di tla abelanwang ka yone** - The passage doesn't discuss how investigation funds will be allocated.
*   **D: Bogolo jwa thoromo ya lefatshe** - While the passage mentions the Earth's impact, the primary focus is on the aftermath and investigation.



Therefore, identifying who will be responsible for the investigation and the consequences that may arise is the most crucial aspect to confirm based on the information provided."
"Go ya ka temana eno, Batten o kile a nna kae mo lenaaneng la Maamerika a a humileng thata?","The correct answer is **A: 400**.

The passage states: ""Batten o ne a le mo maemong a bo-190 mo lenaaneng la 2008 la ma-Amerika a le 400 a a humileng go gaisa...""  This directly indicates that Batten was ranked 400th in the most generous American philanthropists of 2008.
"
Batten o ne a ntsha moneelo mo go ofe wa ba ba latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Lenaane la Maamerika a a humileng go gaisa**.

The passage states that Batten was the CEO of the American Bankruptcy Institute."
Ke eng se se seng karolo ya molaotlhomo o o saenilweng ke Molaodi Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: Go thibelwa ga go rekisiwa kana go hirisiwa ga metshameko ya dibidio e e nang le tirisodikgoka mo baneng ba ba kwa ntle ga California**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is *not* part of the law Schwarzenegger signed. The provided text states the law applies to California. Option C specifically states the law applies to children *outside* of California, which isn't mentioned in the original text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the text:

*   **A: Go thibelwa ga go rekisiwa kana go hirisiwa ga metshameko ya dibidio e e nang le tirisodikgoka mo baneng mo California yotlhe** - This is directly stated in the first sentence.
*   **B: Kotlhao ya madi go ya ka molato mongwe le mongwe** - This is also directly stated in the first sentence.
*   **D: ""Go tlhokega gore metshameko ya thubakanyo e nne le letshwao le mokwalo o o reng """"18"""".sekgomaretsi""** - This is stated as a requirement for movies sold/rented to children.

Therefore, option C is the only one that isn't part of the described law.

"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke mang yo o neng a sa utlwe se se neng se buiwa?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The text states: ""Miller o rile, """"Mike o bua thata mo tshekong... Ke ne ke sentse ke ipaakanya, ke jalo tota ga ke a utlwa se a neng a se bua."""""". This directly indicates that Miller couldn't hear what Mike was saying.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri malebana le se se neng sa diragalela Miller kwa tshekong?","The correct answer is **B: O ne a sa tlhwaya tsebe fa a ntse a ipaakanya.**

Here's why:

The quote from Miller states: """"Mike o bua thata mo tshekong... Ke ne ke sentse ke ipaakanya, ke jalo tota ga ke a utlwa se a neng a se bua."""" This directly indicates that Miller was intoxicated (""ipaakanya"" means drunk in Sesotho) and therefore not fully aware of what Duvall was saying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duvall o ne a kgatlha Miller ka nako ya tsheko** - The quote doesn't say Duvall was arguing, just that he was speaking loudly.
*   **C: Bana ba ga Duvall ba babedi ba ne ba bua thata ka nako ya tsheko** -  This is irrelevant to Miller's experience.
*   **D: O ne a reetsa kgang ya ga Duvall ka kelotlhoko** - The quote suggests Miller *didn't* understand what Duvall was saying, not that he was deliberately ignoring or dismissing him.



"
Ke mang yo o neng a tshitshinya gore go fetolwe ‘Clean Air Act’?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The text states: ""morago ga bokopano ja metsotso e le masome a mabedi le botlhokwa le moetapele wa NDP, Jack Layton, kwa PMO ka Labobedi. Layton o ile a kopa diphetogo di dirwe mo molawaneng wa go tlhokomela tikologo ka nako ya fa bane bana le kopano le PM, ba kopa ”go kwala sesha mo go tseneletseng” ga molawawana wa go tlhokomela tikologo."" This clearly indicates that Jack Layton requested changes to the Clean Air Act.
"
Ke mang yo o neng a ganetsa gore ‘Molao wa Phefo e e Phepa’ o ne o dirisiwa jaaka motshameko wa pele ga ditlhopho?,"The correct answer is **C: Moeteledipele wa NDP**.

The text states: ""morago ga bokopano ja metsotso e le masome a mabedi le botlhwa le moetapele wa NDP, Jack Layton, kwa PMO ka Labobedi. Layton o ile a kopa diphetogo di dirwe mo molawaneng wa go tlhokomela tikologo ka nako ya fa bane bana le kopano le PM, ba kopa ”go kwala sesha mo go tseneletseng” ga molawawana wa go tlhokomela tikologo.""

This clearly indicates that Jack Layton, the leader of the NDP, raised concerns about the Clean Air Act being used as a political stunt.
"
Dikhemikale tsa cyanuric acid le melamine di ne tsa bopiwa ke eng fa di ne di dirisana mmogo mo motlhapeng wa katse?,"The correct answer is **A: Diphilo (Biological matter)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that cyanuric acid and melamine were found in *cat urine* after the cats ate contaminated cat food.  The fact that they are found *together* in cat urine suggests they are a result of a biological process (the cat metabolizing the ingredients).  The passage also mentions that the compounds are found in the *kidneys* of cats, further reinforcing that this is related to biological waste products.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dijo tsa diruiwa (Cat food)** - While the contamination originated from the cat food, the question asks what cyanuric acid and melamine *became* when they interacted *in the cat's urine*. They weren't simply ""cat food"" anymore.
*   **C: Dikhiristale (Crystals)** - While the passage mentions that the compounds are crystalline when compared using FTIR, this doesn't explain what they *are* formed *from* in the urine.
*   **D: Thekenoloji ya go leba dilo ka marang a a tseneletseng (Spectroscopic technology)** - This refers to the method used to identify the compounds, not the compounds themselves.



"
Babatlisisi ba ne ba dirisa thekenoloji ya infrared spectroscopy go bona eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Seelo sa dikhiristale mo motlhapeng wa diphologolo**.

Here's why:

* The question states the researchers used infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to compare the *structure* of melamine and cyanuric acid found in cat urine to the structure found in crystalline products from industrial polymers.  FTIR spectroscopy is used to analyze the vibrational modes of molecules, which are directly related to their structure. Therefore, they were examining the crystal structure of these substances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tiro ya diphilo (Biological activity):** While melamine and cyanuric acid *can* have biological effects, the question focuses on *analyzing* their structure, not their activity.
* **C: Diphologolo tsa mo gae tse di amilweng (Household products):** The comparison is made to *industrial polymers* not household products.
* **D: Dijo tse di kgotletsweng tsa diruiwa (Consumed cat food):**  The question is about analyzing the *components* found in the urine, not the food itself.



"
"""Ke mang yo o neng a bitsa Luna a re ke """"Mohumagadi wa ntlha  yo o Feteletseng""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer o ne a re """"Luna e ne e le Mohumagadi wa ntlha yo o Feteletseng.""

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer was the one who called Luna ""Mohumagadi wa ntlha yo o Feteletseng"".
"
"""Ke mang yo o neng a bitsa Luna a re o  """"popota""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text says: ""Tommy Dreamer o ne a re """"Luna o tlhokafetse mo bosigong jwa ngwedi tse pedi. Seo se ne se farologane tota fela jaaka ene. Mosadi yo o popota."""" ""  This directly translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said """"Luna was missing for two months. That was just odd, like her. A woman who is capricious."""" ""
"
Ke eng se se neng sa se ka sa diragalela mokgweetsi yo o neng a amega mo kotsing?,"The correct answer is **A: O ne a gobetse mo tlhogong** (He was in the garden).

Here's why:

The puzzle states: ""Le fa koloi e betsa, ga gona yo o gobetseng"" (Even though the car crashed, no one was injured). This means the person who saw the unusual things in the garden *wasn't* in the car. The other options describe events *related* to the accident, but don't explain why someone could see strange things without being injured.

The puzzle then describes the person's medical history, indicating they were injured in a previous incident. The clue about the garden suggests the unusual things were seen by the injured person, who wasn't involved in the car crash.

Therefore, the most logical answer is that the person who saw the strange things was in the garden and therefore *not* in the car when the crash happened.



"
Ke eng se se neng se sa tlhomologe mo motshamekong wa Afrika Borwa wa motshameko wa rugby?,"The correct answer is **A: Tiro e e kgatlhang ya setlhopha (The team's impressive performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Go itshwara sentle ga basireletsi, kitso ya go tshwara bolo ka matsetseleko, le go dirisana sentle ga batshameki, go dirile go re ba ikgethe mo go ba bangwe, e bile go tlhatswegile go re se ke setlhopha se ba tla se betsang."" This translates to: ""The good defense, the skill of passing the ball with precision, and the good teamwork made them stand out from the rest, and it was clear that they were not a team to be beaten.""

While options B, C, and D are all *elements* of the impressive performance, option A, ""Tiro e e kgatlhang ya setlhopha"", is the overarching description of what made the team stand out and be so strong. It's the collective effect of all the other positive attributes.



Therefore, the team's *entire performance* was what was impressive.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, motshameko wa Afrika Borwa o simolotse leng go tokafala?","The correct answer is **D: Fa kgaisano e ntse e tsweletse**.

The passage states: ""...e ne ele letsatsi le le siametseng motshameko wa rugby wa bo supa. Bafenyi ba maemo a ntlha ba Aforika Borwa ba simolotse sentle ba bona phenyo motlhofo ya 26 - 00 kgatlhanong le maemo a botlhano a gapilweng ke Zambia. **Ga ba lebega ba ineetse, fa ba tshameka kgatlhanong maphadisanyi ka bo ne go tswa borwa, Aforika Borwa, ene ya tokafala fa motshameko o ntse o tsweletse.**""

This clearly indicates that the game was being followed and the conclusion was reached *as the match continued*.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a sa bontsheng sentle gore itsholelo ya China e ntse jang?","The correct answer is **D: China ga e ise e ko e romele dikoloi di le dintsi go feta Jeremane.**

Here's why:

The question asks which statement *doesn't* reflect China's current economic success. The passage explicitly states: ""Le fa e tsweletse ka go nna puso ya sekomonisi. Mananeo a ntlha a go tlhabolola itsholelo a dirilwe ka fa tlase ga boeteledipele jwa ga Deng Xiaoping. Fa e sa le nako eo, itsholelo ya lefatshe la China e godile ka seelo sa ga 90. **E le la ntlha, ngwaga o o fetileng China e rekiseditse mafatshe a sele dikoloi tse dintsi go feta Jeremane, e bo e feta Amerika ka go nna mmaraka o motona wa kgwebo e.**""

Option D directly contradicts this established fact. The passage says China *now* sells more cars than Germany, implying they didn't in the past. The other options all *support* the passage's claims about China's economic growth and global prominence.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke leng GDP ya China e ka fetang ya United States?","The correct answer is **B: Mo masomeng a mabedi a dingwaga (In the next two decades)**.

The text explicitly states: ""GDP ya China e ka nna ya feta ya Amerika mo dingwageng tse di masome a mabedi tse di tlang."" which translates to ""China's GDP could surpass that of America in the next two decades.""
"
Hu o ne a akantsha gore dinaga tse di tlhabologang di dire eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Go dira ditiro tse di fetang tse ba di dirang gone jaanong.**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""O ne a rotloetsa dinaga tse di santseng di tlhabologa """"go emisa mokgwa wa bogologolo wa go kgotlhela pele mme go phepafadiwe morago."""" O ne a oketsa ka go re """"mme gone ga ba a tshwanela go kopiwa go tsaya maikarabelo a a fetang seemo sa bone sa kgolo, maikarabelo le bokgoni.""""

This means the developing countries need to change their current practices.  Option C, ""Go dira ditiro tse di fetang tse ba di dirang gone jaanong"" (To do different things than they are doing now), best reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go dira dilo tse di tla ba thusang gore ba gole sentle** (To do things that will help them grow well) - This is too general. The passage doesn't say *what* will help them grow well, just that they need to change.
*   **B: Go tlhoma mogopolo mo go ntsheng madi** (To borrow money from the continuous flow of money) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Go tila ditsela tsa bogologolo tsa kgotlelo** (To abandon the traditional ways of collecting) - While related to reducing carbon emissions, the passage focuses on broader changes in practices related to growth, capabilities, and capabilities, not specifically on traditional collection methods.



"
Ke eng se Hu a neng a sa se umaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Letlha le ka lone go solofetsweng gore dikhemikale tsa khabone di tla fokotsega ka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O ne a se ke a bua selekanyo sa go re ba tla kgaola ka bokae, a bua fela go ra selekanyo sa teng se tla laolwa ke mabaka a itsholelo a lefatshe la Chaena."" This translates to: ""He did not say how much they would cut back, he only talked about the existing amount that would be controlled by the natural conditions of China.""

Therefore, Hu Jintao did *not* mention a specific target or amount for carbon emission reduction.  He only acknowledged the existing level and the influence of natural factors.
"
Veerman o ne a re boemo ga bo a siama mo go efe ya dilo tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The quote states that Angola is ""on the way to controlling measles"" and that the situation is still a ""serious challenge in Angola."" Therefore, Veerman was referring to the situation in Angola.
"
"Ka ntlha ya tatofatso, ke mang yo o tla tsayang maemo a ga Huhne mo Kabineteng?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP o lebeletswe go re a tseye tiro ya Tona ya tsa Kgwebo e Davey a e tlogelang."" which translates to ""Norman Lamb MP is expected to take over the Chief Secretary for Business post that Davey is leaving.""
"
Ke mang yo o tla nnang Tona ya Kgwebo morago ga go sekisiwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP o lebeletswe go re a tseye tiro ya Tona ya Kgwebo e Davey a e tlogelang."" which translates to ""Norman Lamb MP is expected to take over the role of Business Secretary that Davey is leaving.""
"
Batshameki ba rotloetsa bareetsi go dira eng ka nako ya opera ya ga Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **A: Nna le seabe mo go gogeng cannabis.**

The passage states: ""Ka ntlha ya seo, badiragatsi ba goga cannabis mo seraleng, mme bobogelo ka bojone bo kgothaletsa babogedi go tsaya karolo."" This translates to: ""Because of this, the performers smoke cannabis in the hall, and the general attitude encourages guests to participate.""

Therefore, the performers are encouraging guests to smoke cannabis.
"
Ke mang yo gantsi a gogang disekerete ka nako ya opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Badiragatsi**.

The text states: ""Ka ntlha ya seo, badiragatsi ba goga cannabis mo seraleng..."" which translates to ""Because of this, the performers smoke cannabis in the restroom..."" Therefore, the performers are the ones smoking.
"
"""Leina le lengwe la """"spacewalk"""" e Leonov a neng a e dira ke lefe?""","The correct answer is **C: Go tsamaya mo lefaufaung, a le kwa ntle ga sesutlhalefaufau.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""O ne a dira tiro ya gagwe ya ntlha ya mosutlhalefaufau, kgotsa """"go tsamaya mo lefaufaung"""", a le kwa ntle ga sesutlhalefaufau a le nosi metsotso e feta fela e le lesome-le-bobedi."" This translates to: ""He performed his main cosmonaut task, or """"spacewalk"""", outside the spacecraft for just over twelve minutes.""

Option C directly reflects this information. The other options are related to Leonov's career, but not the specific type of spacewalk mentioned in the question.
"
Leonov o ne a eteletse pele karolo ya Soviet ya thomo efe?,"The correct answer is **A: Go Gaisana mo Lefaufaung (Going into Space)**.

The text states: ""Leonov, e gape e itsegeng jaaka """"basutlhalefaufau No. 11"""", e ne e le karolo ya setlhopha sa ntlha sa Soviet Union sa basutlhalefaufau. Ka kgwedi ya Tlhakole 18, 1965, o ne a dira tiro ya gagwe ya ntlha ya mosutlhalefaufau, kgotsa """"go tsamaya mo lefaufaung"""", a le kwa ntle ga sesutlhalefaufau a le nosi metsotso e feta fela e le lesome-le-bobedi.""

This directly translates to: ""Leonov, also known as """"Cosmonaut No. 11"""", was part of the initial Soviet Union cosmonaut group. On April 18, 1965, he performed his first cosmonaut mission, or """"going into space"""", outside the spacecraft for just over twelve minutes.""

While he later participated in the Apollo-Soyuz mission, his *first* major role was going into space.  ""Go Gaisana mo Lefaufaung"" is the Sesotho translation of ""going into space.""
"
Ke mang yo o neng a gobala mo kotsing?,"The correct answer is **D: Mokgweetsi wa lori**

The passage states: ""Mokgweetsi wa dilori, yo o nang le dingwaga tse 64, o ne a seka a gobala mo kotsing."" which translates to ""The 64-year-old truck driver had been waiting at the accident site.""
"
Go ne ga direga eng ka batho ba ba neng ba amega mo kotsing eo?,"The correct answer is **A: Boobabedi ba ne ba swa** (Both of them fell).

The text states: ""Go ne go na le bana ba ba neng ba letile go kgabaganya tsela mme botlhe ba gowa e bile ba lela."" This translates to: ""There were children who had run onto the road and all of them fell and lay down."" Therefore, both children fell.
"
Baitsesaense ba ba neng ba dira ka thulaganyo eno ba ne ba solofetse go bona ditlamorago tse di bakwang ke dife tsa dilo tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikarolwana tse dinnye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiori ya re bontsi jwa bontsho go dikologa lesagaripana lwa dinaledi bo fitlhelwa go dikologa lesagaripa lwa dinaledi go dira e kete go a phatsima, se dirwa ke dikarolwana tse dinnye di le dintsi.""

This translates to: ""Theory says that much of the show of the constellations is achieved by the scattering of light from the stars, which is made possible by many small components.""

Therefore, the scientists predicted that the phenomena were caused by **small components** (dikarolwana tse dinnye).



"
Baitsesaense ba ne ba ela tlhoko kgang efe ya dilo tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **D: Losagaripa lwa Sagittarius le Molala wa Tladi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions both the Sagittarius constellation (and its association with the Milky Way) *and* the Moon (referring to its ""celestial dance"" and the similar movement of the Milky Way).  The scientists are studying the relationship between these two celestial bodies, specifically how their movements create a ""celestial dance.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se batho ba ba sa rateng go fetoga ga polotiki ba sa se kgaleng?","The correct answer is **A: Madi a go thusa.**

Here's why:

The question asks what people are *unhappy* about changing in politics. The text states that some of the money meant to help those affected by Hurricane Katrina is being labeled negatively (""Bush's New Orleans Deal"").  This implies dissatisfaction with the *way the aid is being distributed* and the potential for political maneuvering around it.  

Therefore, the core issue people object to isn't necessarily the idea of aid itself, but how it's being managed and potentially politicized – in other words, the ""madi a go thusa"" (the help money). The other options are not directly addressed in the text:

* **B: Go tlhoka maiteko a go tsosolosa** (The need for effort to recover) -  The text doesn't mention effort or recovery.
* **C: Ba ba abelwang dikonteraka tsa kago seša** (Being awarded old contracts) - While the text mentions contracts, the focus is on the *negative framing* of those contracts, not the contracts themselves.
* **D: Ditshenyegelo tsa go aga seša** (Future development concerns) - The text doesn't address future development concerns.



"
Ke mang yo o tshwayang dikonteraka tsa go tsosolosa tiro ya go namola ba ba amilweng ke Setsuatsue sa Katrina diphoso?,"The correct answer is **C: Bush**.

The passage states that the ""accelerated proposal"" was seen by those in Washington as ""Bush's New Orleans Deal."" This directly links the proposal to President Bush. Therefore, the answer is Bush.

"Go ya ka serapa, dipone tsa sekepe sa Stardust di tla bonala kae pele?","The correct answer is **B: Bokone jwa California**.

The passage states: ""Se se ka tsamaela kwa ditshitshing tsa bophirima jwa bokone jwa California..."" which translates to ""It will travel along the western skies of Northern California..."" This indicates that the dust from the Stardust mission will first be visible over Northern California.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, sejanaga seno sa lefaufau se tla tlhoma rekoto ya eng mo go tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **A: Go phatsimisa loapi** (To illuminate).

The passage explicitly states: ""Stardust e tla baya nako e ncha e e khutshwane go fetisa, ya sesutlhalefaufau go boela mo Lefatsheng, **ya sesutlhalefaufau go boela mo Lefatsheng, ya sesutlhalefaufau go bewa ke Apollo X ka Motsheganong wa 1969.**"" and ""**Se se ka tsamaela kwa ditshitshing tsa bophirima jwa bokone jwa California e bile se tla phatshimisa loapi go tswa California go kgabaganya bogare jwa Oregon le go ralala Nevada le Idaho go fitlha kwa Utah.**""

The key phrase is ""**ya sesutlhalefaufau go bewa ke Apollo X ka Motsheganong wa 1969**"" which implies it's a luminous object. And the following statement confirms that it will illuminate areas between California, Oregon, Nevada, Idaho and Utah.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go bonala mo metseng e mentsi** (To be seen in many places) - While it will be *visible*, the primary function highlighted is illumination.
*   **C: Go boela mo Lefatsheng ka bonako** (To return to Earth safely) - The passage discusses its journey and what it *will do*, not whether it will return safely.
*   **D: Go tsamaya go tswa kwa San Francisco go ya kwa Los Angeles ka bonako go gaisa** (To travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles safely) - The passage mentions the travel between San Francisco and Los Angeles but it's not the main purpose. The passage emphasizes illumination more.

Go ne go ntse jang Dr. A Malar Balasubramanian o amana le Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Mmè**.

The text states: ""Ngaka Malar Balasubramanian yo o dingwaga tse 29, o fitlhetswe kwa Blue Ash, Ohio, toropo e e sekgala sa dimaele di le 15 kwa bokone jwa Cincinnati, a rapaletse fa fatshe go bapa le tsela a apere sekipa, le seaparo sa ka fa teng a lebega a le mo maibing a kgatelelo ya melemo. Gone fale, ba bone mmele wa ga Saroja Balsubramniam, 53 o apesitswe ka kobo e e nang le dikolo tsa madi.""

This indicates that Saroja Balsubramniam was Dr. Balasubramanian's mother. Therefore, the answer is ""Mmè"" (Mother).
"
Mmele wa ga Sara Balasubramanian o ne wa fitlhelwa kae?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo teng ga koloi**.

The passage states: ""Gone fale, ba bone mmele wa ga Saroja Balsubramniam, 53 o apesitswe ka kobo e e nang le dikolo tsa madi."" (When they looked down, they saw the body of Saroja Balsubramaniam, 53, inside the car with blood clots).  This directly indicates the body was found inside the car.
"
eBay e ne ya reka eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The text explicitly states that eBay acquired Skype.
"
eBay e batla go fitlhelela eng ka go reka?,"The correct answer is **A: Go nonotsha lotseno lwa yone (To increase its revenue)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes eBay expanding its presence to new regions and offering a wide variety of goods. This expansion is driven by the goal of reaching more customers and ultimately increasing sales, which directly translates to increased revenue.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Go atolosa kwa re nang le kemedi teng (To establish itself where it has resources):** While expanding to new regions requires resources, the core motivation isn't simply to deploy resources. It's about the potential for growth and revenue.
* **C: Dira gore e bonwe ke batho (To be seen by people):**  While visibility is important, it's a means to an end.  The ultimate end is sales and revenue.
* **D: Kgotsofatsa bana-le-seabe (To please children):** This is completely unrelated to eBay's business goals and is not supported by the passage.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a sa kopane le magolegwa a a neng a sala mo jarateng morago ga ntwa?","The correct answer is **C: Batlhankedi (Guardians)**.

The text states: ""...mapodise a a tlametsweng ka didiriswa tsa twantsho ya dikhuduego, ba ne ba tsena mo jarateng, ba kgorogela bagolegwa ka gase e e tshololang dikeledi. **Ba setima molelo ba ne kwa bofelong ba kgona go tima molelo ka 11.35 bosigo.**"" This implies that the guardians were still present in the shack after the police operation. The other options are not mentioned in the text as being present."
Ke eng mo go tse di latelang se kgabagare se neng sa dira gore magolegwa a boele morago mo dikhuduegong?,"The correct answer is **B: Gase e e gogelang (The gas leaking)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mo ise go e kae, mapodise a a tlametsweng ka didiriswa tsa twantsho ya dikhuduego, ba ne ba tsena mo jarateng, ba kgorogela bagolegwa ka gase e e tshololang dikeledi.""  This directly translates to: ""Before that, police officers, equipped with forensic techniques, entered the chamber, **dragged the prisoners out with a leaking gas**.""

The gas leak is the key reason the prisoners were moved. The other options aren't supported by the text:

* **A: Dipuisano Tse di Atlegileng (Quick negotiations):** The passage says negotiations failed.
* **C: Magolegwa a mangwe a a gobetseng (Other prisoners who had succumbed):** The passage mentions prisoners who had died, but doesn't state that *their* condition caused the evacuation.
* **D: Molelo (The commotion/noise):** While there was commotion, the gas leak was the immediate and critical factor.



"
"Go ya ka pono ya ga Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, naga ya Iran e tshwanetse go gololesega mo go eng?","The correct answer is **D: Go ikaega ka oli**.

The passage states: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, o tlhalositse gore go ikaega thata ka leokwaneng ke ”serai” sa pele ga phetogo ya Iselamo ya Iran ka 1979 le se naga e tshwanetseng ya ikgolola mo go sone."" This directly translates to Iran needing to be self-reliant in oil.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a dumela gore kgaosetso-dipapadisanyo e ama itsholelo ya Iran?","The correct answer is **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei**.

The passage states: ""Thekiso ya leokwane le e na le seabe sa 80% ya letseno mo itsholelong ya Iran. Go pegong ya yone ya kgwedi e e tswang go feta, OPEC e supa fa thekiso ya kwantle ya leokwane le le sa tlhotlhiwang e wetse ko tlase...

This clearly indicates that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the one who believes oil self-sufficiency is crucial for Iran."
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa akarediweng mo thulaganyong ya go bouta ya Fora?,"The correct answer is **C: Go saena lenaane la batlhophi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the original French prison system had difficulty with prisoners assaulting each other. The solution introduced boxes for prisoners to protect them from this violence. The text *doesn't* mention prisoners signing their names after an assault, or anything related to that process.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: Mabokoso a go tlhopha a a bonalang sentle:** The text clearly states that boxes were introduced in 1988.
*   **B: Baemedi ba ba rometsweng ke batlhophiwa:** The text mentions prisoners sending memos to check on the management of the prison.
*   **D: Diboutu tse di balwang ke baemedi ba ba tlhophilweng:** The text states that prisoners were counted by guards and that this was done according to established rules.

Therefore, the only option *not* discussed is prisoners signing their names."
Batlhophi ba supa kae motho yo ba mo tlhophileng?,"The correct answer is **A: Mo lenaaneng la batlhophi (In the clan's treasury)**.

The passage states: ""Fa motlhopise a fetsa gore nnetefatsa motlhopi, a bo a digela tlhopho ya gagwe mo lebokosong..."" which translates to ""When the clan determines the punishment of a person, it puts the clan's treasure in a box..."" This indicates the treasure (and presumably the person being punished) is kept within the clan's treasury.
"
Ke eng se se neng sa dira gore Allen a simolole go batla Musashi ka dingwaga di le robedi?,"The correct answer is **D: Kgatlhego ya gagwe mo ntweng (His old reef obsession)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Allen go bolelwa ha beeleditse bontsi jwa madi a gagwe mo ditlhotlhomisong tsa ka fa tlase ga metsi e bile o simolotse letsholo la gagwe la go batla Musashi go tswa mo kgatlhegong ya gagwe ya ntwa.""  This translates to: ""Allen didn't spend much of his money on underwater explorations and instead started his quest to find Musashi from his old reef obsession.""

While the other options might be related to Allen's activities, the passage directly links his long-term pursuit of Musashi to his old reef obsession.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, Allen o ne a dirisa madi a mantsi a gagwe mo go eng?","The correct answer is **B: Dipatlisiso tsa lewatle (Underwater explorations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mongwe wa bahumi mo lefatsheng ka bophara, Allen go bolelwa ha beeleditse bontsi jwa madi a gagwe mo ditlhotlhomisong tsa ka fa tlase ka metle e bile o simolotse letsholo la gagwe la go batla Musashi go tswa mo kgatlhegong ya gagwe ya kgale ya ntwa.""

This translates to: ""One of the world's leading explorers, Allen is believed to have invested much of his money in underwater explorations and has begun his quest to find Musashi from his old cliff formation.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions investing heavily in underwater explorations. While ROVs and mapping are related to underwater exploration, the broader category of ""underwater explorations"" is the most accurate answer based on the given text.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke sefe sa dilo tse di latelang se se ka tswang se ile sa dira gore go nne le maemo a a kotsi mo setlhareng le mo tikologong ya sone?","The correct answer is **A: Leokwane la yuraniamo.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the presence of Cesium and Iodine indicates that uranium fuel rods have likely melted. Uranium is the core component of nuclear fuel.  The melting of the uranium fuel rods is the primary event that led to the release of radioactive materials. While Cesium and Iodine are *byproducts* of that melting process, the *cause* of the dangerous situation is the uranium.

Therefore, the melted uranium is the root cause of the environmental and health risks described in the text.
"
Ke efe ya ditshitshinyo tse di latelang e e seng nngwe ya ditshitshinyo tsa pabalesego tse di neng tsa akantshiwa baagi ba selegae morago ga tiragalo e e diragetseng kwa setheong?,"The correct answer is **A: Tila go dirisa didirisiwa tse di dirang gore go nne le moya o o phepa (Stop using air purifiers)**.

Here's why:

The passage details the dangers of radioactive contamination following a nuclear incident.  The symptoms described (vomiting, hair loss, lack of water) are consistent with radiation exposure. The passage specifically mentions cesium and iodine. The options relate to preventative measures.

* **B: Nna mo teng (I was there):** This is a statement of fact, not a preventative measure.
* **C: Tila go hema mosi o mosweu (Stop inhaling the smoke):** This is a direct preventative measure against inhaling radioactive particles.
* **D: O se ka wa nwa metsi a pompo (You shouldn't drink tap water):** This is a crucial preventative measure because water can be contaminated.
* **A: Tila go dirisa didirisiwa tse di dirang gore go nne le moya o o phepa (Stop using air purifiers):**  While air purifiers *can* help, the passage implies that relying solely on them might be insufficient. It's a less effective preventative measure than stopping exposure to the contaminated air in the first place. The passage focuses on the source of the contamination (radioactive particles) and how to avoid them, rather than on mitigating the effects of exposure with air purifiers.

Therefore, stopping the use of air purifiers is the least effective preventative measure listed compared to the other options.



"
"Go ya ka Dr. Moll, ke eng se se tshosang thata ka XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Palo e e kwa godimo ya dintsho tse o di bakang.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Mo potsolotsong, o ne a re mofuta o mosha o """"o tshosa tota ka ntha ya palo e e kwa godimo ya dintsho tse o di bakang."""" "" This translates to ""In the briefing, he said the new strain is """"much more dangerous because of the higher number of bacteria it causes."""" ""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mofuta ono o ne wa tsenwe ke mogare o, kwa bookelong.** While this is mentioned, it's not the *reason* Dr. Moll considers it dangerous.  It's a possible mode of transmission, not the dangerous characteristic itself.
* **B: Mofuta ono o na le go emelana le diritibatsi.** The passage doesn't mention drug resistance.
* **C: Palo ya batho ba motho yo o tshwaeditsweng a ka ba tshwaetsang.** This describes the *impact* of an infected person, but not what makes the XDR-TB strain inherently dangerous.



"
Go tlhomamisitswe gore ke balwetse ba le kae ba ba tshwaeditsweng ke mofuta o moša wa mogare ba e neng e le badiri ba tsa kalafi?,"The correct answer is **C: 15**.

The text states: ""Mme fela, palo ya mogare wa XDR-TB mo setlhopeng sa batho botlhe ba ba nang le bolwetse jwa kgotlholo e tona, e lebega e santse e le ko tlase; 6,000 mo palong yothe ya batho ba le 330,000 ba ba amilweng ke bolwetse mo nakong eno, mo Aforika Borwa."" and "" Mme fela, palo ya mogare wa XDR-TB mo setlhopeng sa batho botlhe ba ba nang le bolwetse jwa kgotlholo e tona, o kgona go tshwaetsa ba le 10 go ya ko go 15, ba ba amanang le ene thata.""

Therefore, the answer is 15.
"
Tsamaiso ya NextGen e dirisa thekenoloji ya mofuta ofe?,"The correct answer is **C: Thekenoloji e e ikaegileng ka disupalefelo tsa mo lefatsheng (Satellite-based autonomous technology)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""It uses **satellite-based autonomous technology** to pinpoint the location of aircraft...""
* While the other options mention elements of NextGen, they aren't the core technology used for aircraft tracking. The key is the combination of satellite technology *and* autonomous capabilities.
"
Baokamedi ba dipalangwa tsa difofane ba solegelwa molemo jang ke NextGen ka tlhamalalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Go supa kwa difofane di leng teng ka nepo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that NextGen uses satellite technology and ground-based technology to ""track aircraft accurately and precisely locate them relative to each other."" This directly relates to the ability to precisely locate aircraft.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Go fofa sekgala se sennye** - While NextGen contributes to safety, the primary focus mentioned isn't just on preventing collisions.
* **C: Go fokotsa mosi o o kgotlelang** - Reducing emissions is mentioned as a *result* of NextGen, but not the core benefit for pilots.
* **D: Di somarele dimilione tsa dilithara tsa leokwane ka ngwaga le go feta** - This is a detail about the *scale* of the program, not a benefit to pilots.



Therefore, the best answer reflecting a direct benefit for pilots is accurately locating aircraft."
"Go ya ka serapa, bakwadi ba hisitori ga ba a ka ba tshwaya phoso FBI ka go bo e ne e tlhomile mogopolo mo go eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go oketsa selekanyo sa katlego ya bone (To enhance their intelligence gathering)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the FBI started a program in 2005 to deploy ten agents to monitor small-scale drug trafficking, specifically to **enhance their intelligence gathering** capabilities.  The goal was to improve the FBI's ability to understand and disrupt criminal networks.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Go abela bokebekwa jo bo ka rarabololwang motlhofo madi (To divide legally obtained money)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about dividing money.
* **C: Go tlhoma mogopolo thata mo dikgannyeng tsa ditshwantsho tsa thobalano (To uncover difficult plots within surveillance footage)** - While the agents *might* hope to uncover plots, the primary stated goal is intelligence gathering, not specifically uncovering difficult plots.
* **D: Dikgetsi tsa koloi tse di utswitsweng (Switched car signals)** -  Switched car signals are mentioned as examples of drug trafficking, but not as the reason the FBI started the program.



"
Letsholo la go thibela boitsholo jo bo maswe le pateletsa FBI go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Tlhoma mogopolo mo bokebekweng jo bo tshwanetseng go rarabololwa motlhofo.**

Here's why:

The passage describes the FBI's efforts to investigate and prevent illegal gambling operations, particularly those involving horse racing. The core strategy involves gathering intelligence on these operations. Option C directly reflects this: ""Investigate the underlying business that needs to be prosecuted.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go aba ditsompelo tse di oketsegileng go tlhokomela dikgetsi tsa dikoloi tse di utswitsweng:** While tracking vehicle data *might* be part of an investigation, the passage emphasizes the broader goal of understanding the illegal gambling business itself.
*   **B: Go oketsa kelo ya katlego ya setheo:**  While intelligence gathering aims to improve the FBI's success rate, it's not the primary *preventative* measure described.
*   **D: Baemedi ba ba ineetseng mo dikgannyeng tsa ditshwantsho tsa thobalano:** This describes a *method* of intelligence gathering (monitoring video feeds), but not the underlying *strategy* of investigating the illegal business.



"
Go ne ga direga eng ka koloi ya setimamolelo e e neng ya tsibogela go thulana ga JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **B: E ne ya pitikologa**.

The passage states: ""Bobegadikgang jwa lefelo leo bo begile fa koloi ya setimamolelo ya maemelo-difofane e ne ya **pitikologa** e le mo letsholong la go thusa mo tiragalong e."" (The location where the flight data recorder was located was found to be **damaged** in the investigation to help with the incident.)



"
"Morago ga go Phatlakanathubega ga JAS 39C Gripen, boemafofane bo ne jwa tswalwa go dira eng?","The correct answer is **A: Difofane tsa kgwebo (Commercial aircraft)**.

The text explicitly states: ""boemelo-difofane bo tswalelwe difofane tsa kgwebo"" which translates to ""the air traffic was caused by commercial aircraft"".
"
Brzezinski o ne a kaela mang ka nako ya Phetogo ya Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The text explicitly states that Brzezinski served as National Security Advisor (NSA) to Carter from 1977 to 1981, and the Iranian Revolution happened in 1979. Therefore, he would have been working with Carter at that time.
"
Ke mang yo o neng a nna Mogakolodi wa Tshireletsego ya Bosetšhaba go fitlha ka 1977?,"The correct answer is **D: Johnson**.

The passage states: ""Mo dingwageng tsa bo-1960, Brzezinski o ne a direla John F. Kennedy jaaka mogakolodi wa gagwe, mme morago, a direla le botsamaisi jwa ga Lyndon B. Johnson."" This directly indicates that Brzezinski was a counselor to Lyndon B. Johnson *before* becoming National Security Advisor to Jimmy Carter in 1977.
"
Ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a sa bontsheng sentle gore Bobek o ne a dira tiro ya gagwe le Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **B: O nole dino di le dintsi go feta motshameki ope fela (He scored more goals than any other player).**

Here's why:

The question asks which statement *doesn't* paint Bobek in a positive light regarding his performance. Options A, C, and D all highlight his impressive achievements and positive contributions to Partizan Belgrade. Option B, however, while stating a fact (he scored a lot of goals), doesn't really offer any *insight* into *how* he achieved that. It just states the outcome.  It's a neutral statement and doesn't imply skill, dedication, or any other positive attributes of his work.

Therefore, it's the least complimentary statement about his work with the team.



"
Ke mafoko afe a a boammaaruri ka ditso tsa ga Bobek le Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: O ne a simolola go tshamekela Partizan ka 1945**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Bobek, o a tsholetsweng kwa motsemoshate wa Croatia o o bidiwang Zagreb, o sele a tuma thata fa a tshamekela Partizan Belgrade. O ne a ikgolaganya le bone ka 1945 a bo a nna go fitlha ka 1958."" (Bobek, who was from the Croatian city of Zagreb, strongly claimed that he started playing for Partizan Belgrade in 1945 and stayed until 1958.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O ne a tshamekela Zagreb pele ga Partizan Belgrade:** The text doesn't mention this. It only states he was *from* Zagreb.
* **C: O ne a tshamekela Partizan go fitlha ka 1995:** The text says he was *dismissed* as a player in 1995, not that he played until that year. He left in 1958.
* **D: O ne a tuma fa a sena go tlhophiwa jaaka motshameki yo o gaisang wa Partizan:** The text says he was *dismissed* as a player, not that he was recently dismissed and claiming a new role.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke nonofo efe e e farologanyang Hesperonychus le Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **C: E diphuka tse dintsi** (It had many feathers).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Nonyane e, e diphuka tse dintsi..."" which translates to ""It was small, and it had many feathers...""
* While Hesperonychus and Velociraptor both walked on two feet, the key differentiator highlighted in the text is the presence of feathers on Hesperonychus.  The text mentions the second toe being small and the name ""Hesperonychus"" meaning ""western sunset claw"" due to the light color of the second toe, but it's the feathers that are the distinguishing feature mentioned in relation to Velociraptor.
* Options A and B are incorrect because both animals walked on two feet. Option D is not mentioned in the text.



"
"""Bokao jwa leina la """"Hesperonychus"""" bo tswa mo selong sefe sa mofuta ono?""","The correct answer is **D: Leboko**.

The text states: ""Lenala la yone la bobedi le ne le letona, ka jalo la isa magoletsa leina la Hesperonycus, ra ya """"lenala la letlhakore la bophirima tsatsi."""" "" which translates to ""Its second claw was small, thus giving rise to the name Hesperonychus, meaning ""western sunset claw.""""  Therefore, the name is derived from the **claw** (leboko).
"
Ke mafoko afe a a boammaaruri mo go a a latelang malebana le go thuntshiwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Monna le mosadi ba ne ba tswa kwa Texas**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Batho ba palo e e sa fetiweng ke 100 ba ne ba tseneletse moletlo, go ipelela ngwaga wa ntlha mo lenyalong la baratani ba tseo ya bone e tshwerweng mo ngwageng o o fetileng. Baratani ba nyalane kwa Texas ngwaga o fetileng mme ba tla kwa Buffalo go keteka le ditsala le masika.""  This directly confirms the man and his wife were from Texas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go ne go le batswasetlhabelo ba le batlhano:** The passage states ""Monna wa dingwaga tse 30, yo o tsholetsweng kwa Buffalo, e ne e le mongwe wa batho ba le 4 ba ba bolailweng fa go thuntshiwa"". This implies 4 people were killed, not 5.
* **C: Banyalani bano ba ne ba nyalana ngwaga pele ga foo kwa Buffalo:** The passage says the *group* of people came to Buffalo to celebrate, not specifically that *women* had previously visited.
* **D: Go thuntshiwa go diragetse kwa Buffalo:** The passage says the *group* was in Buffalo to celebrate, and the man was killed *there*.  It doesn't explicitly state the shooting happened in Buffalo.



"
Ke polelo efe e e boammaaruri malebana le tiragalo e go thuntshitsweng mo go yone?,"The correct answer is **A: Go ne ga diragala kwa moletlong wa segopotso kwa Buffalo** (It happened at a fraternity party in Buffalo).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Baokamedi ba tlhalositse boipelo jo bo ka fa tsamaisong bo tla nna teng mo nakong e e tla bolelwang. Baratani ba nyalane kwa Texas ngwaga o fetileng mme ba tla kwa Buffalo go keteka le ditsala le masika."" (The investigators described the circumstances that would be in the coming events. The fraternity members vacationed in Texas last year and came to Buffalo to celebrate fall and winter.) This indicates the events occurred at a fraternity party in Buffalo.
* **Option B** is incorrect because the passage doesn't mention a legal investigation.
* **Option C** is incorrect because the passage states the fraternity members were in Buffalo, not Texas.
* **Option D** is incorrect. While the passage mentions fraternity members, it doesn't say the incident happened *only* at a sorority party. It happened at a fraternity party.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, badiredibagolo ba ne ba tshwenyegile ka eng fa ba utlwa ka Luno?","The correct answer is **B: Makhubu le diphefo tse di maatla (Strong winds and debris)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Diphefho tse mashetla le makhubu tsa e kgoromeletsa mo maboteng a a diretsweng go sireletsa letshitshi kgatlhanong le makhubu a mashetla.""  This translates to ""Strong winds and debris battered the walls used to protect the city from strong winds.""  This indicates the strong winds and debris were a primary concern.

While the other options are possible consequences of the storm, the passage directly highlights the wind and debris as the cause of worry.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a malebana le go tlhatlhamololwa ga Luno a a seng boammaaruri?","The correct answer is **A: Go senyega go ne ga diragala pele ga go tsewa dithoto (The accident happened before the causes were known).**

Here's why:

The question asks about *untruthful explanations* for Luno's accident. Option A directly addresses this by stating that the cause of the accident wasn't immediately understood. This implies that initial explanations (or lack thereof) might have been inaccurate or incomplete. The other options simply state facts about the accident, not about misleading explanations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sekepe se ne se na le dimetara di le 100 tsa lookwane fa se ne se senyega (The boat had 100 meters of railing when it sank):** This is a factual statement about the boat's construction, not a misleading explanation.
*   **C: Babereki mmogo ba le lesome le bobedi, mme go nnile le kgobalo fela ya go robega nko (Twenty-one passengers were on board, and there was only a smell of burnt nose):** This is a factual statement about the passengers and the smell, not a misleading explanation.
*   **D: Sekepe se ne sa kgoromelediwa mo seretseng (The boat was not moored to the shore):** While potentially relevant to the accident's cause, this isn't necessarily an *untruthful explanation* in itself. It just describes the boat's position.

Therefore, option A is the only one that directly relates to the possibility of inaccurate or misleading explanations about what caused Luno's accident.
"
Algeria e ne ya nna naga e e ikemetseng ka ngwaga ofe?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo dingwageng tsa bo 1960.**

The text states: ""Mo dingwageng tsa bo-1960, o ne a boela ko lefatsheng la Algeria go ya go ruta go tsamaisa ditshwantsho tsa motshikinyego."" This means Vautier returned to Algeria in the 1960s.  Algeria gained independence in 1962.

Ke kae koo go neng go se na dithelebišene gone mo phitlhong?,"The correct answer is **A: Mo mafelong a a farologaneng mo Roma (In various locations in Rome)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ke ne ga tsenngwa dithelebishene di le mmalwa tse di tona mo mafelong a a farologaneng mo Roma go dira go re batho ba kgone go leba moletlo."" (Few large televisions were installed in various locations in Rome so that people could watch the spectacle.)

While options B and C are related (Italy and Poland also had similar setups), the question asks *where* televisions were *not* present. Option D is too specific, as televisions were not *everywhere*, just in various locations. Therefore, option A best reflects the information given.
"
Tirelo ya phitlho e ne e tshwaretswe kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Mo mafelong a a farologaneng kwa Roma (In various locations in Rome)**.

The text states: ""Ga tsenngwa dithelebishene di le mmalwa tse di tona mo mafelong a a farologaneng mo Roma go dira go re batho ba kgone go leba moletlo."" This translates to ""A few big screens were set up in various locations in Rome so that people could watch the spectacle.""

While the event was at St. Peter's Square, the screens were placed in *various locations* throughout Rome to allow more people to view it. Poland also held a similar event, but the question asks where the *ceremony* was broadcast.



"
"Morago ga go thunya, ke mang yo o neng a alafelwa dikgobalo tse di masisi?","The correct answer is **A: Batho ba le batlhano ba ba neng ba le teng**.

The text states: ""Batho ba le batlhano ba ba neng ba le teng nako ya go thunya ba ne ba alafelwa letshogo."" which translates to ""The five people who were there when the fire broke out were taken as hostages.""
"
Ke mang yo o neng a bega ka go dutla ga gase?,"The correct answer is **A: Moagisane mo kagong (The servant in the kitchen).**

The passage states: ""Modiredi wa kgwebo ya gase o ne a goroga ko tiragalong morago ga go re **moagisane a mo leletse mabapi le go dutla ga gase.**"" This translates to ""The sales manager came in the back after the **servant asked him about the ghost**.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke batho ba le kae ba ba neng ba swa mo tlhaselong eo?","The correct answer is **C: 5**.

The passage states: ""Tlhobolo ya ga Uka e ile sa tlholwa fa se santse se supile tlhogo ya monna wa **botlhano**.""  This translates to ""Uka's wreckage was found after it hit the head of a **fifth** man."" So, five people were injured.
"
Sebetsa sa ga mang se ne sa tlholwa ke go thuntsha ka nako nngwe fa go ne go tlhaselwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The passage states: ""Tlhobolo ya ga Uka e ile sa tlholwa fa se santse se supile tlhogo ya monna wa botlhano."" This translates to ""Uka's body was found after the head of the fifth man was found."" Therefore, Uka's body was the one discovered at the same time as the head.
"
Ke mofuta ofe wa metshameko o o neng wa tlosiwa mo thulaganyong ya Diolimpiki?,"The correct answer is **A: Squash** and **D: Karate**.

The text states that ""Metshameko ya squash, karate le roller e lekile go tsennwa mo lenaneong la di-Olympics..."" which translates to ""Squash, karate and roller skating have been tried to be included in the Olympics...""  It also mentions that baseball and softball were previously part of the Olympics.

Therefore, both Squash and Karate were considered but not yet included.
"
Ke mofuta ofe wa metshameko e e latelang o Komiti ya Boditšhabatšhaba ya Diolimpiki e neng ya tlhopha gore o akarediwe mo metshamekong eno?,"The correct answer is **A: Roller**.

The text states: ""Metshameko ya squash, karate le roller e lekile go tsennwa mo lenaneong la di-Olympics..."" (Squash, karate, and roller sports have tried to be included in the Olympics...) and ""...baseball le softball, e e ntshitsweng mo metshamekong ya di-Olympic ka ngwaga wa 2005."" (baseball and softball, which were featured in the Olympic Games in 2005.)

Therefore, Roller is among the sports that were considered for inclusion.
"
Kwa tshimologong Arthur Guinness o ne a hira St James' Gate Brewery ka dingwaga tse kae?,"The correct answer is **B: 10**

The passage states: ""Morago ga dingwaga di le 250, Guinness e godile go nna kgwebo ya mafatshefatshe..."" This means it took 250 years *after* 1759 for Guinness to become a global company.  Therefore, Arthur Guinness rented the brewery 10 years after 1759 (1759 + 10 = 1769). However, 10 is not an option. 

The question is asking when he *first* rented it. The passage tells us the agreement was for 9000 years, and that 250 years later it became a global company. The question asks *when* he first rented the brewery, and it says the agreement was for 9,000 years, and it took 250 years for Guinness to become a global company, therefore it took 10 years for Guinness to first rent the brewery. I believe that the question meant to ask about how many years after the agreement was signed, that the company became a global business.
"
Guinness e dira diranta di le dibilione di le kae ka ngwaga?,"The correct answer is **C: Di-euro di le lesome (US$14.7 billion)**.

The text states: ""Guinness e godile go nna kgwebo ya mafatshefatshe, e e dirang madi a a fetang dibilione tsa di-euro di le lesome (US$14.7 billion) ngwaga le ngwaga.""  This directly answers the question.
"
Go lemogilwe mogare wa H5N1 mo dinageng di le kae tsa European Union?,"The correct answer is **C: Bosupa**.

The text states: ""Naga ya Fora ke ya bosupa mo kgolaganong yaMafatshe a Yuropa ya go sotlwa ke mogare o..."" which translates to ""France is the most affected country in the European Union outbreak of the bird flu...""

Therefore, the answer is **C: Bosupa (Most Affected)**.
"
Motho wa bofelo yo o neng a tshwaeditswe ke mogare wa H5N1 o ne a bonwa kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Fora**.

The text states: ""Naga ya Fora ke ya bosupa mo kgolaganong yaMafatshe a Yuropa ya go sotlwa ke mogare o; e latela Austria, Geremane, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece le Italy."" This translates to ""France is the most affected country in the European Union outbreak; it is followed by Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy.""
"
Haiti e ne ya kopana leng la bofelo le bolwetse jono pele ga bo anama ka ntlha ya badisa ba kagiso?,"The correct answer is **A: Dingwaga tsa bo-1800.**

The passage states: ""Pele ga kgorogo ya masole, Haiti e ne e ise e itemogele mathata a a malebana le bolwetse ga e sale ka dingwaga tsa bo-1800."" This directly answers the question about Haiti's health situation before the outbreak linked to the peacekeeping mission.
"
Ke matlakala a a tswang kwa lefelong lefe a a neng a baka go anama ga bolwetse jono?,"The correct answer is **A: Noka ya Artibonite**.

The text explicitly states: ""Go ya ka kgetse, leswe le le tswang mo kampeng ya Lekgotla la Dichaba tse di Kopaneng le ne sa tlosiwa leswe sentle, mme seo sa dira go re baketeria e tsene mo molatswaneng wa Noka ya Artibonite, nngwe ya dinoka tse dikgolo tsa Haiti."" This means the bacteria entered the Artibonite River, which is a major river in Haiti.



"
Puso ya Ireland e ikaeletse go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Melao e e gololesegileng malebana le go letlelelwa ga diritibatsi.**

Here's why:

* The text states the Irish government is moving to *regulate* the use of beneficial schemes (like tax avoidance) to protect the rule of law and accountability.
* Option C, ""Melao e e gololesegileng malebana le go letlelelwa ga diritibatsi,"" directly translates to ""Regulations concerning the taxation of tax avoidance."" This accurately reflects the government's intention to create rules and controls around tax avoidance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go tlhama molao ka bonako jo bo kgonegang mabapi le batho ba ba dirang tlolomolao ya diritibatsi** (To pass a carefully considered law regarding those who engage in tax avoidance) - While careful consideration is mentioned, the text focuses on regulation, not necessarily a completely new law.
* **B: Go tlhama melao e e gagametseng malebana le gore diritibatsi di letlelelwa jang.** (To pass independent laws regarding how tax avoidance is taxed) -  The emphasis is on *regulation* - controlling and managing, not independent, separate laws.
* **D: Go tlosa tlolomolao mo diritibatsing.** (To eliminate tax avoidance) - The text doesn't suggest eliminating tax avoidance, but rather regulating it.



"
Ke eng se se neng se letleletswe semolao ka nakwana kwa Ireland?,"The correct answer is **C: Go Tlhaselwa (Protection)**.

The passage states that the Irish government is being urged to carefully consider the impact of new laws on human rights and the rule of law. The Council of State expressed concern that people's fundamental rights, such as freedom of assembly, are threatened by the new legislation. This indicates a concern for **protection** of those rights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go thuba (Opportunity):** While new laws *might* create opportunities, the passage focuses on potential negative consequences, not opportunities.
* **B: Bokebekwa (Accountability):** Accountability is related to government responsibility, but the primary concern raised is the impact on individual rights.
* **D: Diokobatsi (Security):** The passage doesn't mention security as a key concern; it focuses on civil liberties.



"
Motho yo go belaelwang gore o dirile molato o batlisisiwa ka eng?,"The correct answer is **D: E seng wa go senyaka (Not a natural/genuine one)**.

The passage states: ""...dipatlisiso di ne di dirwa mo rre wa mmelaelwa go wa go dira molato go tsena mo lefelong la mong a sena tetla e seng wa go senyaka."" This translates to ""...investigations were carried out on the guest regarding committing a crime to enter the life of someone with a not-genuine/fake birth certificate.""

Therefore, the investigation is focused on the authenticity of the birth certificate.
"
"Fa motho yo o belaelwang a ne a fetola letshwao, o ne a se ka a dira eng?","The correct answer is **A: Fetola nngwe ya ditlhaka tsa yone** (Change one of its letters).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diphetogo di ne di dirwa ka thapoline e ntsho e kgabisitswe ka ditshupo tsa kagiso le pelo go fetola tlhaka ya """"O"""" go tlhaka """"e"""" e nnye."" This translates to: ""Changes were made with the help of a spiritual guide, using symbols of peace and heart to change the letter 'O' into the letter 'e'.""

The key is that the change involved altering the letter itself. The options relate to this direct alteration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E kgabise ka tshupo ya kagiso** (It was combined with a symbol of peace): While symbols of peace were used *during* the process, the core action was the letter changing.
*   **C: Go e senya mo mmeleng** (To destroy it in the body): This is not mentioned or implied in the passage.
*   **D: Dirisa thapoline e ntsho go e fetola** (Use a spiritual guide to change it): While a guide was used, the question asks what the person being influenced could do. The person being influenced *had* to change the letter itself.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, morutabana wa Seesemane e bong Karno o ne a sa latofadiwe ka eng mo go tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **A: Go ne go na le dipego tsa gore o dirisa ditlhapa fa a ruta.**

Here's why:

The question asks what Karno was *not* found to be disciplined for.  The text explicitly states: ""Mo melaetseeng ya gagwe o dirisitse mafoko a batsadi bangwe ba neng ba a tsaya e le a a sa tlhotlhiwang, gape go na le **dipego tsa go re o ne a dirisa ditlhapa fa a ruta**.""  This means using threats was *one* of the things he was disciplined for.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A ntse fela jaaka tsala mo baithuting.** This is *part* of a description of *how* he taught, not a reason for discipline. It's meant to be a negative description, not a disciplinary action.
* **C: Go gatisa dipapatso tse di sa letlelelwang.** This is mentioned as a way he was *compared* unfavorably to other teachers, not something *he* was disciplined for.
* **D: Go dirisa puo e e leswe mo phaposing.** While the text says he used ""puo ya setsotsi"" (vulgar language) in the classroom, it's connected to his teaching methods and wasn't listed as a separate disciplinary reason.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a sa tsewa e le motshwarwa ke Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **A: Bajanala**.

The passage states: ""Rolando Mendoza o ne a thuntsha bajanala ka tlhobolo ya gagwe ya M16."" This translates to ""Rolando Mendoza was shooting civilians with his M16 rifle."" Therefore, the civilians were the ones being shot, and the question asks who Mendoza was identified as shooting.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke batshwarwa bafe ba go neng go sa tlhomamisiwa gore ba tla gololwa pele ga nako?","The correct answer is **A: Bajanala (Civilians)**.

The passage states: ""Batswarwakananyo ba le barataro, go akaretsa bana le bagolo, ba ne ba gololwa go sa le gale, fela jaaka ba tsayadinepe ba ma-Phillipines."" This translates to ""Civilians, including children and adults, were killed without warning, just like the Filipino civilians.""  Therefore, civilians were the ones who were killed without warning.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o kokoanyang mesaeno ya go tshegetsa go letlelelwa ga manyalo a batho ba bong jo bo tshwanang kwa Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Badiraditshupetso (Lawmakers)**.

The text states: ""Badiraditshupetso ba solofela go amogela kopo ya mesaeno..."" which translates to ""Lawmakers have promised to accept the bill..."" This indicates that lawmakers are the ones supporting the legislation to allow same-sex marriage.
"
Batlhabanelatumelo ba tla naya mang kopo ya bone?,"The correct answer is **A: Kereke ya Roman Catholic**.

The passage states: ""Badiraditshupetso ba solofela go amogela kopo ya mesaeno e le sedikadike tse 1, 2 go e isa kwa Lekgotla kgolo la sechaba ka Ngwanatsele."" and earlier says ""Molao-kakanyetso wa ntlha o ne wa kwalwa ke rratoropo wa pele Sao Paulo..."" and ""...Kereke ya Roman Catholic e tlhamaletse kgatlhanong le go molao o o letang go nyalana ga batho ba bong bole bongwe.""

The context suggests the Catholic Church is the one submitting the petitions.  The petitions are related to the Church's efforts to influence legislation regarding same-sex marriage, which was originally written by São Paulo but is now being handled by Roberto Jefferson.
"
"Go ya ka pego ya ga Armand Versace, go ne ga direga eng pele ga boidiidi bo simolola go tsibogela maemo a bosa?","The correct answer is **A: E bo e simolola go na ka sehako.**

Armand says: ""Go tswa foo pula ya simologa, ka bokete jo bo betsang letlalo ekete nnale, e bo e simolola go na ka sehako..."" which translates to ""From there the rain started, with a dark, ominous cloud, it started from the forehead...""  ""Sehako"" means forehead or top. Therefore, the rain started from the top (forehead/sky).
"
"Go ya ka Versace, diphefo tse di maatla di ne tsa simolola leng?","The correct answer is **D: E bo e simolola go na ka sehako.**

Armand says: ""Metsotso e sekae morago ga gore pontsho e simolola, motsotso o latelang, phefo di tsamaya mo go 70km/oura… go tswa foo pula ya simologa, ka bokete jo bo betsang letlalo ekete nnale, e bo e simolola go na ka sehako...""

This translates to: ""Moments after the shooting started, the cars started at 70km/hour... from there the rain started, with a cloud as dark as night, and it started at the peak...""

Therefore, the powerful explosions started at the peak (go na ka sehako).
"
"Pele ga Fred, go ne go na le ditsuatsue di le kae tse dikgolo tse di neng di begilwe kwa botlhaba jwa 35°W?","The correct answer is **A: Ga go ope (None)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Fred ke sone setshuatshue sa metsi se segolo se se kileng sa bonala bokgala kwa borwa le botlhaba mo Atlantic...ele setshuatshue sa boraro se bonetse go pota mola wa 35°W ka fa botlhabatsatsi.""

This means Fred is the third major marine debris detected at that location (35°W).  Since he's the *third*, there were no major marine debris found *before* him at that location. Therefore the answer is none.
"
"Fa Fred a ne a le gaufi le ditlhaketlhake tsa Cape Verde, o ne a ya ntlheng efe?","The correct answer is **D: Bokone-bophirima**

The passage states: ""...Fred ke sone setshuatshue sa metsi se segolo se se kileng sa bonala bokgala kwa borwa le botlhaba mo Atlantic, sale go similola go tsaya ditshwantsho ka disathalaite; ebile ele setshuatshue sa boraro se bonetse go pota mola wa 35°W ka fa botlhabatsatsi.""

This implies Fred is west of the Cape Verde Islands, and the passage says he is traveling west. Therefore, he is traveling in a west-northwest direction, which is close to northwest. However, since the options only offer ""Bokone-bophirima"" (Northwest), it's the closest accurate answer given.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e nang le lobelo lo lo kwa godimo go feta tse di tlileng pele ga yone?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The question states that 802.11n is an improvement over previous standards and offers speeds of up to 600Mbit/s.  The other options (802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a) are older standards with significantly lower speeds.
"
Ke eng se se tlhokegang gore 802.11n e dirisanye le 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **A: Lobelo la 2.4Ghz le la 5.0Ghz.**

Here's why:

* **802.11n supports both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz bands.** The question states this directly.  To be compatible with older standards like 802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g, the 802.11n device needs to operate on frequencies that those older standards also use.
* **802.11b only operates on the 2.4 GHz band.**  It doesn't support 5.0 GHz.
* **600Mbit/s is the *speed* of 802.11n.** It's a feature, not a requirement for compatibility with older standards.
* **Dual radios are *used* by 802.11n to support both bands.**  While true, it's not the *requirement* for compatibility with 802.11b. The presence of the 2.4 GHz band is the crucial element.



Therefore, the ability to operate on both the 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz bands is the fundamental requirement for 802.11n to function with devices using older standards like 802.11b.



"
Mofenyi wa metale wa gouta wa Diolimpiki o ne a tshwanetse go thuma mo metshamekong e le kae kwa Metshamekong ya Mafatshe a Selekane?,"The correct answer is **C: Tse pedi** (Two).

The question states he was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle in **two** different qualifying events at the World Championships in Budapest.
"
Ke ka ntlha yang fa mmampodi wa metale wa gouta wa Diolimpiki a ne a sa tseye melemo ya ditlhabi tsa gagwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntse a sa kgone go tsaya diokobatsi tse a di tlhokang gore a okobatse matlhaba,ka di sa letlelelwa mo metshamekong.**

Here's why:

* The question asks *why* the athlete didn't take advantage of their talent.
* The passage explicitly states: ""Ntse a sa kgone go tsaya diokobatsi tse a di tlhokang go re a okobatse matlhaba, ka di sa letlelelwa mo metshamekong."" (Because he couldn't achieve the necessary times to win medals, and was not allowed to compete in the competitions).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: O ne a sa utlwe botlhoko bope (He wasn't given much consideration).** While this might be *part* of the problem, it doesn't fully explain why he didn't compete.
* **B: Ntse a sa kgone go tsaya diokobatsi tse a di tlhokang (Because he couldn't achieve the necessary times).** This is partially correct but doesn't address *why* he couldn't achieve those times - it's related to not being allowed to compete.
* **D: Ga go a letlelelwa kwa Metshamekong ya Mafatshe a Selekane (He wasn't allowed to compete at the World Championships).** This is true, but it's a consequence of the main problem (not being able to achieve the times) - it's not the root cause of him not taking advantage of his talent.

Therefore, option C best captures the reason why the athlete didn't perform well."
"Go ya ka temana e, ke eng se se ka tswang se ile sa dira gore go nne le tlhakatlhakano malebang le tiragalo ya dithoromo tsa lefatshe?","The correct answer is **A: Go nna gone ga maru a ntshontsho.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maru a ntshontsho a a sa amaneng ka gope le tiragalo ya lekgwamolelo go ne ga begiwa fa a bonetse ka fa tlase ga thaba. Maru a tlisitse kgonagalo ya tsietsego ya go re a mme tota lekgwamolelo le diragetse."" (Animal tremors unrelated to the eruption were detected below the mountain. The animals provided an early warning that the eruption was indeed happening.)

This indicates that the animal tremors were the early warning sign that led to the realization the eruption was occurring, and caused confusion with the initial seismic activity.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Dipego tsa offisi ya tepoloapi ya Iceland:** While the observatory's reports are important, they don't *cause* the confusion; they *respond* to it.
* **C: Mmapa wa mafatshefatshe ka dithoromo tsa lefatshe:**  A world map of earthquakes is a tool for tracking, not a cause of confusion.
* **D: Tiro e e begilweng mo dikgaolong tse dingwe tsa Iceland:**  Eruptions in other parts of Iceland are unrelated to the confusion described.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go ne ga direga leng gore go nne le phetogo e kgolo?","The correct answer is **C: Ka Mopitlo a le 10.**

The passage states: ""Thoromo ya lefatshe e e tseneletseng, e e neng ya fetola seemo kwa letlhakoreng la bokone-botlhaba jwa mosima o o kwa godimo ga lekgwamolelo e diragetse ka Mopitlo a le 10."" which translates to ""The recent earthquake, which shifted the ground north of the volcano located above the eruption, occurred with magnitude 10.""
"
"Ke mafoko afe a a latelang, a a malebana le sedirisiwa sa Chandrayaan-1, a a sa siamang?","The correct answer is **A: Sekepe se se neng sa e romela se ne se na le batho ba se neng se tsamaya le bone.**

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states Chandrayaan-1 was an uncrewed mission.**  It mentions ""didirisiwa tse di botlhokwa tsa maranyane"" (small important instruments) and describes what the instruments did. It *never* mentions humans being on board.
* **Options B, C, and D are accurate statements based on the passage.**  Chandrayaan-1 *did* have important instruments, the mission *was* successful (as implied by the description of the MIP), and it *did* have the Indian flag painted on it.

Therefore, the only statement that *isn't* supported by the text is that the spacecraft carried people.



"
"Ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang, a a tlhalosang sentle se se neng sa dirwa ke sedirisiwa sa go tlhatlhoba ngwedi?","The best answer is **C: E ne ya wela ka katlego gaufi le south pole ya ngwedi.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the *best* description of what was done by the lunar probe.** Option C directly states the probe's landing location, which is a key piece of information about its mission.
* **Option A** is true, but less descriptive than C.
* **Option B** focuses on the speed of the landing, which is secondary to the location.
* **Option D** mentions a separate detail (the instruments used), but doesn't describe the overall action of the probe.

Therefore, option C is the most comprehensive and accurate description of the probe's activity as described in the passage.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke kgato efe ya go sireletsa kgatlhanong le bolwetse e e tla dirisiwang la bofelo?","The correct answer is **D: Matsela a thibelang menang.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Tlhatlogo ya bolwetse e tlhotlheleditse mmuso ya kwa India go tsenya mo tirisong go anamisa batshwari ba dikolobe mo mafelong a amegileng thata, go aba **dikete tsa matsela a thibelang menang** le dibolaya leroborobo la diji.""

This clearly indicates that the government is using mosquito nets to prevent the spread of the disease.
"
Bolwetse jono bo tsena jang mo bathong?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikolobe**

The passage states: ""Bolwetse bo tsamaisiwa ke dikolobe, bo bo bo tsena batho ka menang."" This translates to ""The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes, which enter people through the bite.""

Therefore, the disease enters people through mosquito bites.
"
Go palelwa ke go dirisa polelwana ya bobedi go ka felela ka eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Tshwanelo ya mo isagweng ya go nyalana ga batho ba bong jo bo tshwanang**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the second amendment was aimed at preventing the violation of the right to bear arms and potentially allowing crimes to be committed by people of the same race.
* The core of the second amendment is about individual rights and the right to self-defense, which relates directly to the right to bear arms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tshekatsheko ya ka bonako ya HJR-3:**  While HJR-3 is mentioned, the text focuses on the purpose of the second amendment, not the outcome of HJR-3.
* **C: Nakokopanong ya tokafatso ya melao:** While the second amendment *is* part of the legal framework, the question asks about the *result* of using the second amendment, not its place within the legal framework.
* **D: Go thibelwa ga manyalo a batho ba bong jo bo tshwanang:** The text implies the second amendment was *intended* to prevent this, but the question asks what the *use* of the amendment would *lead to*.  The amendment itself is about rights, not a guarantee against specific crimes.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, polelwana ya bobedi e ne ya kganelwa ka fa molaong leng?","The correct answer is **A: Ka nako ya kopano ya molaotheo (during the parliamentary session)**.

The text states: ""Go na le phetogo e e dirilweng mo nakokopanong ya tokafatso ya melao moo ba Ntlo ya Baemedi ba Setšhaba ba ileng ba phimola seele sa bobedi mme molao oo o ile wa dumalanwa o ntse jalo ke ba Lekgotlakgolo ka Mosupologo."" This translates to ""There was a change made during the parliamentary session where the National Assembly of Parliament introduced a second bill, and the bill was then passed as is by the Portfolio Committee.""

Therefore, the second bill was considered during the parliamentary session.
"
"""Ke bomang ba ba neng ba filwe """"Dipampiri tsa Panama""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Bobegadikgang.**

The text states: ""Dipampiri di bontshitse gore dibanka di le lesome-le-bone di thusitse bahumi go fitlha dikhumo tsa madi a fitlhang go dibilione tsa didolara tsa Amerika go tila go duela makgetho le melawana e mengwe.""  This directly translates to ""The papers showed that dozens of banks helped clients to obtain gains of up to billions of US dollars to evade taxes and other laws.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Setheo sa molao sa Mossack Fonseca:** Mossack Fonseca *created* the papers, they weren't *given* them.
*   **C: Deutsche bank:** While Deutsche Bank was involved, the text describes *clients* being given the papers.
*   **D: Baeteledipele ba puso ya Iceland:**  They were *potentially* involved (and did rotate staff), but the text focuses on who was *given* the papers.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo bobegadikgang jwa Borithane bo neng jwa bolela gore o ne a laola bontsi jwa ditlamo tse di neng di dirisiwa go fitlha dikhumo?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche bank.**

The text states: ""Lokwalodikgang lwa Borithane e leng The Guardian le bontsha gore Deutsche Bank e e laolwang ke nngwetharong ya dikhampani di le 1 200 tsa dikgapetla tse di diretsweng go dira seno."" This translates to ""The British newspaper The Guardian revealed that Deutsche Bank was controlled by a network of 1,200 shell companies used to do this.""
"
"Ke dife tsa dikotsi tse di latelang tsa difofane, tse di neng tsa bolaya batho ba le bantsi?","The correct answer is **A: Sefofane se ne sa phutlhama fa se ne se ya kwa Armenia, se tswa kwa Iran.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Iran e bone kotsi ya bone e masisi go di feta tsotlhe ya tsamo phefong fa sefofane se se neng seya Armenia..."". This means the helicopter crash in Armenia resulted in the highest number of deaths.
* It also mentions, ""Mo tshimologo ya beke eno, sefofane sa mapodisi sa tlhoo-tomo, se ile sa phatlakana go bo go swa batho ba le bararo, go bo go gobala ba le bararo ba bangwe."" This refers to the police helicopter crash in Iran, but it caused a lower death toll than the Armenia crash.
* Option C is incorrect because it reverses the direction of travel.
* Option D refers to a helicopter that *stopped* and caused damage, not a crash resulting in many deaths.

Therefore, the helicopter crash in Armenia is the event that resulted in the highest number of deaths mentioned in the passage.
"
Ke eng mo go tse di latelang se e seng lebaka la gore go nne le dikotsi tse dintsi tsa difofane kwa Iran?,"The correct answer is **D: Difofane tse di sa tlhokomelweng sentle.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the problem is due to **old, neglected motorcycles** used by the military and the general public. This lack of maintenance is a primary cause of the accidents.
*   Options A, B, and C all contribute to the problem, either directly or indirectly. The old motorcycles are a direct cause, the international sanctions limit new motorcycle purchases, and the sanctions indirectly perpetuate the use of old, unsafe vehicles.
*   While neglected motorcycles worsen the situation, the core *reason* for the danger is the age and neglect. Options A, B, and C address the *factors contributing to the situation*, while Option D describes a *result* of the primary issue.

Therefore, Option D is the least accurate answer because it doesn't address the root cause of the motorcycle accidents. The accidents are caused by the condition of the motorcycles, not just the fact that they aren't well-maintained (although neglect certainly exacerbates the problem).

"Ke dintlha dife tse di latelang, tse di neng di seyo mo pegong ya dithutiso tsa kwa Iraq?","The correct answer is **A: Go tshwaiwa maitlamo a gompieno a Bookamedi.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pego e e tshwaya phoso thata bontsi ja dikarolotsa maitlamo a gompieno a Bookamedi, a a itebagantseng le Iraq mme e rotloetsa phetogo ya se ka bofefo."" This translates to: ""The statement strongly criticizes the current sentiments of Bookamedi, which have been involved with Iraq and calls for a positive change.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kitsiso ya gore ka diphetogo dingwe, dintwa tsa tumelo le tlhakatlhakano di ka emiswa.** The passage implies this *as a result* of the changes being proposed, but doesn't state it as a separate, existing point in the original statement.
* **C: Mo megopolong ya bone ya go sireletsa melelwane ya Iraq** This is a detail *within* the changes being proposed, not a separate point that was *already* in the original statement.
* **D: Go kopa dipuisano, go batla tumalano mo lefatshe la Amerika ka maikemisetso a lone go mafatshe a kwa Botlhaba-gare.** This is the *reason* for the changes being proposed, not a separate point that was already in the original statement.



"
Setlhopha sa dithutiso sa kwa Iraq  se ne sa se ka sa Tlhomamisa eng mo go seno se se latelang mo pegong ya sone?,"The correct answer is **B: Phetogo ya bofefo (A change for the better)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pego e e tshwaya phoso thata bontsi ja dikarolotsa maitlamo a gompieno a Bookamedi, a a itebagantseng le Iraq mme e rotloetsa phetogo ya se ka bofefo."" This translates to: ""The statement emphasizes the many mistakes in today's political decisions that have affected Iraq and calls for a change for the better.""

While option D is *mentioned* in the statement, it's presented as *one of the actions already taken*, not something the statement *couldn't* have affirmed. The statement's core message is the desire for a positive change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gore go itsisiwe gore go tla sireletswa melelwane kgatlhanong le botlhabetsi (That it has been decided that meetings with the opposition will be protected):** While the passage mentions efforts to protect meetings, it's not the central point the statement *couldn't* have affirmed. It's a specific action within the broader call for positive change.
* **C: Go dirisa puisano e e bulegileng (To use open diplomacy):** The passage mentions open diplomacy as part of the strategy, but it's not the primary focus of what the statement *couldn't* have affirmed.
* **D: Go simololwe mothale o mongwe wa dipuisano pele ngwaga o, o wela (That another diplomatic mission was launched a year ago and failed):**  This is a specific detail mentioned as a past action. The statement isn't necessarily affirming or denying this past failure; it's focused on the *future* and the *desire for improvement*.



Therefore, the statement's strongest affirmation is the desire for a ""phetogo ya bofefo"" - a change for the better.



"
"Go ya ka mapodisi, ke mang yo o neng a tsewa e le letsogo la moja la ga Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Picco**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mapodisi a ne a re Lo Picco o mo maemong a kwa godimo ka go re o nnile mothusi wa ga Provenzano kwa Palermo..."" which translates to ""The police said Lo Picco was in a high position because he had become an assistant to Provenzano in Palermo...""
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e neilweng mo karolong eno, ke eng se se gapileng botshelo jwa Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Botshelo jwa gagwe bo ne jwa gapiwa ka nako ya ntwa e e neng e eteletswe pele ke Riina**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ntwa e e neng ya gapa matshelo a batlhani ba mmafia e bong Giovanni Falcone e le ka ngwaga was 1992..."" which translates to ""The leadership conflict that caused the deaths of many mafia figures, including Giovanni Falcone, was in 1992..."" and then mentions Riina as the leader at that time.  Falcone was killed *because* of the leadership conflict Riina was involved in.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O ne a thuntshiwa ke mapodisi:** The text says Lo Picco was *identified* by the police as connected to Provenzano, not that Falcone was *transferred* by them.
* **C: Lo Picco o ne a tla dira gore ntwa ya boetapele e ne e tla runya:** Lo Picco's actions were *related to* the leadership conflict, but he didn't *cause* it.
* **D: O ne a bolawa ke Paulo Borsellino yo e neng e le mongwe wa Batlhabani ba Mmafia:** The text states Falcone and Borsellino were *both* killed in the conflict, not that Borsellino killed Falcone.  Furthermore, the text clarifies they were both mafia figures (""Batlhabani ba Mmafia"").



"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e seng nngwe ya dilo tse Hitoshi Saito a di anaanelang?,"The correct answer is **D: Mankge wa Judo**.

The text explicitly states that Hitoshi Saito was a gold medalist at the Olympics and a two-time World Champion. It also states he was the chairman of the Japanese Judo Federation. While he was a judo athlete, the text doesn't mention him being a *teacher* of Judo.
"
Iwasaki o ne a kgona jang go falola nyalo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tibet**.

The passage states: ""O ne a utswelwa ke dilalome, a tlhaselwa ke ntsa e e nang le molafu ko Tibet, a falola nyalo ko Nepal a bo a tshwarwa ke ba sepodise ko India.""  This translates to: ""He was caught by the police, arrested with a drug in Tibet, smuggled a drug in Nepal and was then arrested by police in India.""  The key phrase is ""...a tlhaselwa ke ntsa e e nang le molafu **ko Tibet**"" which means ""...arrested with a drug **in Tibet**"".

Therefore, Iwasaki was arrested with a drug *in* Tibet, meaning he was able to smuggle the drug *from* Tibet.
"
Ke mang yo o neng a tlhasela Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntša**.

The passage states: ""O ne a utswelwa ke dilalome, a tlhaselwa ke ntsa e e nang le molafu ko Tibet..."" which translates to ""He was kidnapped by smugglers, abducted by a drug-laced suitcase in Tibet..."" Therefore, the suitcase (ntša) is what abducted him.
"
Alonso o ne a wetsa leng lebelo la gagwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa Schumacher a sena go wetsa lobelo lwa gagwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Michael Schumacher o feditse kgaisano ya gagwe moragonyana fela ga Alonso, ka lebaka la ditshenyego tsa sasepenshene go tswa mo dintweng tse dintsi mo kgaisanong."" (Michael Schumacher finished his race just behind Alonso, due to numerous retirement incidents in the race.)

This implies that Alonso overtook Schumacher *after* Schumacher retired. Therefore, Alonso won the lead when Schumacher retired.
"
Ke eng se se neng sa dira gore Schumacher a fetse kgaisano ya gagwe pele ga nako?,"The correct answer is **D: Go senyega ga sasepenshene ya koloi (Car suspension failure)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Michael Schumacher feditse kgaisano ya gagwe moragonyana fela ga Alonso, ka lebaka la ditshenyego tsa sasepenshene go tswa mo dintweng tse dintsi mo kgaisanong."" which translates to ""Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso, due to multiple car suspension failures in the race.""



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O ne a latlhegelwa ke taolo ya koloi ya gagwe (He was hampered by his car's controls):** While the text mentions Fisichella losing control, it doesn't say this *caused* Schumacher's early retirement.
* **B: Go thulana le Alonso (Competing with Alonso):** The text says Schumacher finished *after* Alonso, not because of direct competition.
* **C: Tshenyo ya maotwana e e bakilweng ke Fisichella (A collision caused by Fisichella):**  The text mentions Fisichella losing control, but not a collision with Schumacher.

"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke tiro ya ga mang go baya batho ba ba tshwerweng kwa lefelong la batshwarwa?","The correct answer is **A: Lepodise le le tshwereng mmelaelwa**.

The passage states: ""...Moatlhodi Glynn kgatlhanong le setheo go pateletsa go gololwa ga ba ba ntseng ba tshwere dioura di feta 24 fa ba sena go tsewa mme ba sa amogela ditheetso tsa motsamaisi wa kgotlatshekelo. **Molaodi o baya tlhwatlhwa ya madi a kgololo, fa kopo ya teng e atlegile, a bo a bega semmuso, ditatofatso tse di begilweng ke lepodise le le tshwereng mmelaelwa.**""  This clearly indicates the investigating officer (lepodise le le tshwereng mmelaelwa) is responsible for initiating the detention.
"
"Go ya ka taelo ya kganelo ya nakwana ya go tsena mo ntlong e e umakilweng mo serapeng, batho ba ba tshwerweng ba tshwanetse go letlelelwa go nna le eng gore ba tshwarwe lobaka lo lo fetang diura di le 24?","The correct answer is **A: Ba golotswe**.

The passage states: ""Mo Moranang monongwaga, taelo ya kganelo ya nakwana e ne ya ntshiwa ke Moatlhodi Glynn kgatlhanong le setheo go pateletsa go gololwa ga ba ba ntseng ba tshwere dioura di feta 24 fa ba sena go tsewa mme ba sa amogela ditheetso tsa motsamaisi wa kgotlatshekelo.""

This directly translates to: ""In the past year, an emergency warrant was issued by Magistrate Glynn in consultation with the prosecutor to prevent the arrest of those who had been detained for more than 24 hours after being identified and not accepting the instructions of the court administrator.""

Therefore, the people in question were arrested (golotswe).
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke lebaka lefe le le sa dirisiwang go tlhalosa go emisa tswelopele ya ditlhopho?","The correct answer is **B: Kganetsano le molaotheo (Objection to the law/legal opposition)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Baemedi ba mafatshe ba re ba bone tlhakatlhakano ya selekanyo se se kwa godingwana mo molao-motheong wa Afghanistan, mo go diriling go re ba tseye tshweetso ya go re tikilogo e nngwe ya ditlhopho ga e tlhokafale. Se se ganetsana le dipego tsa pele tse di buang go emisa go tikologo ya bofelo ya ditlhopho e tlabo e le tlolo molao.""

This translates to: ""International observers have seen a dispute within the Afghan legal system, leading to a reversal of the decision to protect one ethnic group, which contradicts early statements that the protection of the survival of a vulnerable ethnic group should be a legal obligation.""

Therefore, the passage highlights the disagreement and opposition to the law regarding the protection of ethnic groups.  The reversal of the decision is due to this legal dispute.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tshireletsego e e nnang mo kotsing (Protection based on risk):** While risk might be a factor in considering protection, the passage focuses on the legal *dispute* rather than risk itself.
*   **C: Ditshenyegelo tse di kwa godimo (Higher-up considerations):** The passage doesn't mention any higher-up considerations or political influences.
*   **D: Go potapota ga molaotheo (Erosion of the law):** The passage describes a *reversal* of a legal decision, not necessarily an erosion of the law itself. It's more about the legal system's conflict.



"
"Goreng, mo bofelong, badipolomate ba sa tsaya gore go a tlhokega go tswela pele ka ditlhopho?","The correct answer is **C: Go ne go na le go potapota mo molaotheong (There was a contradiction in the law).**

Here's why:

The text states that international observers saw a ""quantity conflict"" in the Afghan legal framework, indicating a contradiction or inconsistency in the law. This contradiction is what led Lodin to take action to halt the process, as it threatened the safety of the ethnic groups.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Go ne go le kgatlhanong le molaotheo (There was an agreement on the law):** This is the opposite of what the text describes. The text explicitly mentions a conflict *within* the law.
*   **B: Tshireletsego e ne e le mo kotsing (Protection was at risk):** While protection *was* at risk, this is a consequence of the contradictory law, not the reason diplomats hesitated to proceed.
*   **D: Ditlhopho di ne di ja madi a le mantsi thata (The groups were consuming too much money):** The text doesn't mention financial issues as a factor.

Therefore, the contradiction in the law is the most logical reason for the diplomats' hesitation.



"
Ke mang a tlamelang FATA ka ditirelo tsa boatlhodi?,"The correct answer is **A: Puso ya Pakistane**.

The passage states: ""Tautona wa Pakistan o ne a tlhoma 'Badiredi ba tsa Polotiki' go laola FATA...Baemedi bano ba ikarabelela ka go naya ditirelo tsa puso le tsa bosiamisi ka fa tlase ga Kgatiso 247 ya Molaotheo wa Pakistan.""  This means the Pakistani government appointed political agents to administer FATA.
"
"Ke dife tsa dintlha tse di latelang ka “ Baemedi ba Sepolotiki” ba FATA, tse e seng nnete?","The answer is **B: Ba ne ba tlhophiwa ke moporesidente wa Pakistane** (They were appointed by the President of Pakistan).

Here's why:

The text states the ""Political Agents"" were appointed under Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution, implying an administrative appointment, not one made by the President. The other options are supported by the text:

* **A: Ba tlamela ditirelo tsa boatlhodi** (They received government services) - The text mentions they were given government and administrative services.
* **C: Ba obamela molaotheo wa Pakistane** (They were subject to Pakistani law) -  The text states they operated under the Pakistan Constitution and laws.
* **D: Ba na le taolo ka botlalo mo dikgaolong tse dingwe** (They had ultimate control in other areas) - The text explicitly states they had authority to govern the tribal areas as they wished.

Therefore, the only incorrect statement is that they were appointed by the President.



"
Ke sekgele sefe seo Emma Stone a neng a se tlhophetswe?,"The correct answer is **C: Modiragatsi wa mosadi yo o gaisang botlhe**.

The passage states: ""Gosling le Stone ba tlhophilwe go ya makgalokgannyeng a go phadisanyetsa sekgele sa Modiragatsi yo o Gaisang, wa monna, le wa mosadi, ka tatelano."" This directly translates to ""Gosling and Stone were nominated to present the award for Best Actor and Best Actress, jointly.""
"
Ke sekgele sefe seo baesekopo e neng e sa tlhophelwa sone?,"The correct answer is **B: Matsetseleko a a gaisang botlhe a go laola tse re di bonang.**

Here's why:

The text states that the film *La La Land* received nominations in 14 categories.  The question asks what category was *not* nominated for. The film did receive nominations for *all* the technical categories listed (Cinematography, Costume Design, Film-editing, Original Score, Production Design, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Original Screenplay) and for Best Picture, Director, and actors.  The question is asking which category was **missing**, and the only option that describes a broad category that wouldn't have been specifically mentioned is ""Matsetseleko a a gaisang botlhe a go laola tse re di bonang"" (All the elements that control what we see).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Setshwantsho se se di gaisang tsotlhe** (All the films): This isn't a category in the Oscars.
*   **C: Tswakanyo ya medumo, e e gaisang yotlhe** (All the popularity polls): This is not a category.
*   **D: Pina e e itlhametsweng, e e gaisang tsotlhe** (All the independent songs): While the film *did* feature independent songs, there isn't a category specifically for ""all independent songs.""



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa leng ya tswelela pele e dira morago ga thoromo ya lefatshe?,"The correct answer is **D: Lefelo la go fetlha motlakase mo Niigata**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant was performing well *before* the earthquake. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami then led to the shutdown of the plant.  The other options all experienced damage or were directly affected *because of* the earthquake:

* **A: Didiriswa tsotlhe tse di laolang maatla kwa bodirelong ba Hokuriku Shika:** These control systems were damaged as a result of the earthquake.
* **B: Boemafofane mo Ishikawa:**  The tsunami caused damage to boats in Ishikawa.
* **C: Tirelo yotlhe ya diterena:** Train lines were disrupted due to the earthquake.

Therefore, the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa power plant's *performance* in Niigata was the initial state that was disrupted *after* the earthquake, not something that caused the earthquake to happen.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e senyegileng ka ntlha ya thoromo ya lefatshe?","The correct answer is **B: Didiriswa tse pedi tse di laolang maatla kwa bodirelong jwa Shika**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the power lines controlling Units 1 and 2 of the Shika nuclear power plant were damaged due to the earthquake. 
* While the earthquake also caused damage to other things (like roads and bullet trains), the passage specifically highlights the damage to the power control systems as a major consequence.
* The other options are mentioned as secondary effects.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dikgang tse di latelang, e e sa akarediwang mo tokomaneng?","The correct answer is **B: Se se bakileng ntwa ya 1967**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the conflict revolves around the situation *after* the 1967 Six-Day War. Options A, C, and D are all directly mentioned as points of contention *resulting from* that war. Option B, stating that the situation ""caused"" the 1967 war, is inaccurate based on the information provided. The passage is describing the aftermath of the war, not its cause.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e seng nngwe ya ditopo tsa Palestina?","The correct answer is **D: Go nna gone ga masole ga dingwaga di le tlhano mo mokgatšheng wa Jordan**.

Here's why:

* The question asks for something *not* typically considered one of the core issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
* While the presence of Israeli soldiers in the West Bank is a significant point of contention, the statement that it has been the case for *five years* is inaccurate according to the provided text. The text mentions a PA agreement for only five years of Israeli presence there. 
* The other options (A, B, and C) are all directly mentioned as core issues:
    * **A: Melelwane e e theilweng mo maemong a pele ga ntwa (The conflict based on the pre-1967 borders)** is the foundational issue.
    * **B: Go nna gone ga masole mo go tsweletseng, mokgatšheng wa Jordan (The presence of soldiers in the West Bank)** is a key part of the conflict.
    * **C: Dikarabo tebang le isagwe ya Jerusalema (The settlements and the status of Jerusalem)** are major sticking points.



"
Ma o ithutetse molao mo lefatsheng lefe?,"The correct answer is **D: Hong Kong**.

The passage states: ""Ma o tsholetswe kwa Hong Kong..."" which means ""Ma was educated in Hong Kong...""
"
"Go ya ka temana,bobueledi ba lefatshe lefe bo thusitse mo phenyong ya Ma ya ditlhopho?","The correct answer is **B: Hong Kong**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Ma was ""tsholetswe kwa Hong Kong"" (sent to Hong Kong).  It also mentions that he ""atlega thata mo moeding o o buelelang go okediwa ga dikgolagano le lefatshe-legolo la Chaena"" (struggled to be accepted in the world of international negotiations and the global Chinese community). This implies Hong Kong played a significant role in his development and ultimately, his success. The passage doesn't mention the other options in relation to helping Ma.



"
"Jaaka go kailwe mo temaneng, Carolyn Wilson o ne a direla mang pele a fuduga kwa toropong eo?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The text states: ""Fa bahirisi ba simolola go abelana se se ba tlhagetseng, bontsi jwa malwapa a a ne a amega a ile a lemoga g ne foo go re Carolyn Wilson wa **OHA** o utsule madi a bone a peeletso..."" This indicates that Carolyn Wilson, who works for OHA (Office of Child Abuse), was the one who allegedly misappropriated the funds.
"
"Ka go setse mabelo a le mane mo pakeng, ke mang yo o leng mo maemong a bone a Bommampodi ba Bakgweetsi?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

The question asks who is in the 8th position, and the text states: ""Kahne le Truex ba mo maemong a botlhano le borataro ka go letelelana, ka dintlha di le 2,220 le 2,207."" This means Truex and Kahne are tied for 5th and 6th, and then it states ""mme a sia Bowyer ka di le tlhano."" This means Hamlin is 5 places ahead of Bowyer. Therefore, Bowyer is in 8th place."
"Morago ga lobelo lo lo umakilweng mo temaneng, Kahne o na le dintlha di le kae mo Bommampoding ba Bakgweetsi?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The question asks about Kahne's position *after* the race. The text states: ""Truex ba mo maemong a botlhano le borataro ka go letelelana, ka dintlha di le 2,220 le 2,207."" This means Truex is in 5th and 6th place, with 2220 and 2207 points respectively.  Since the question asks about Kahne after the race, and Kahne is not mentioned in the provided information, we can infer that Kahne is in the 5th position because he's tied with Truex in 5th and 6th position. Looking at the provided options, 2220 is the point total for the driver tied with Truex who is in 5th/6th place.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke ga kae batho ba bona didumedi tse di welang mo lefatsheng, tseo morago go fitlhelwang di tswa kwa polaneteng ya Mars?","The correct answer is **C: Ga lesome tlhano**.

The passage states: ""Matlapa a le lesome le botlhano mo go one a, a amanngwa le meteorite shower ya ngogola ka Phukwi."" which translates to ""Fifteen of these are associated with a meteor shower of fire in February.""  This indicates that 15 of the identified meteorites are believed to be from Mars.
"
"Jaaka go umakilwe mo temaneng, ke eng sa boammaruri ka matlapa a go fitlhetsweng a tswa kwa polaneteng ya Mars?","The correct answer is **B: Di 24,000**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Matlapa a le lesome le botlhano mo go one a, a amanngwa le meteorite shower ya ngogola ka Phukwi. Matlapa a le lesome le botlhano mo go one a, a amanngwa le meteorite shower ya ngogola ka Phukwi. Matlapa a le lesome le botlhano mo go one a, a amanngwa le meteorite shower ya ngogola ka Phukwi. Matlapa a le lesome le botlhano mo go one a, a amanngwa le meteorite shower ya ngogola ka Phukwi."" This indicates that there are approximately 24,000 meteorites that fall to Earth each year.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsotlhe, di fitlhetswe ka Phukwi, ka nako ya fa maje a magolo a tswa kwa lefaufaung, a wela fa fatshe** - While many are linked to a shower in February, it doesn't mean *all* are.
* **C: Boleng ba tsone bo feta ba gauta ka $11,000** - The passage says they are valued *more* than platinum and gold, but doesn't explicitly state they exceed the value of gold by that specific amount.
* **D: Di 34** - The passage states there are *approximately* 24,000, not 34.



"
Schumacher o rotse tiro neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Morago ga phenyo ya gagwe ya bosupa ya bommampodi.**

The text states: ""Schumacher yo o tlogetseng tiro ka 2006 morago ga go fenya bommampodi jwa Formula 1 ka makgetlho a le supa..."" which translates to ""Schumacher got the job in 2006 after recovering from a severe racing injury...""

While the other options are related, they aren't the *direct* reason he got the job.  He got the job *because* of his recovery from the injury.
"
Massa o gobetse neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka nako ya Grand Prix**.

The text states: ""Motho wa letso lwa Brazil o gobetse tlhogo morago ga go nna le kotsi ko dikgaisanong tsa Hungarian Grand Prix ka ngwaga wa 2009."" This translates to ""The Brazilian driver injured himself after having an accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009."" Therefore, he was injured *during* the Grand Prix.
"
"Go ya ka temana, thulaganyo e tla ama jang AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Palo ya badirisi ba AOL e tla gaisiwa ke ya badirisi ba Yahoo le Microsoft**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the combined user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft is *surpassing* AOL's.  This directly implies that AOL's user base is likely to decline as people switch to those platforms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Palo ya badirisi ba AOL e ka nna ya oketsega:** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.
* **B: AOL e tla nna setheo se le sosi se se tlhabolotsweng mo mmarakeng wa IM:** The passage indicates a decline, not a resurgence.
* **D: AOL ga e sa tlhole e tla dirisiwa kwa Dinageng tse di Kopaneng tsa Amerika:**  The passage doesn't explicitly say AOL will stop being used in the US, but it implies a shrinking user base due to competition.  It's a less direct consequence than the user base being surpassed.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka felang, morago ga thulaganyo e ntšha?","The correct answer is **C: Kgololosego ya AOL ya go tlhabolola mmaraka ka lebelo la yone (AOL's expectation of market growth)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL's growth strategy of dominating the instant messaging (IM) market in the United States is in jeopardy due to declining user bases of Yahoo! and Microsoft.  This directly implies that AOL's *expectation* of successful growth is likely to fail.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Tlhabololo ya inthanete e aname mo Dinageng tse di Kopaneng tsa Amerika (The remaining internet growth in the United States):** While internet growth might be affected, the passage doesn't specifically focus on the overall internet growth. It centers on AOL's *IM market* growth.
*   **B: Tiriso ya mmaraka wa IM (The use of the IM market):** The passage indicates a decline in IM use overall, not that the market will cease to exist.
*   **D: Tirisanommogo ya Yahoo le Microsoft (The partnership between Yahoo and Microsoft):** The passage only mentions the decline in user bases of Yahoo and Microsoft, not the future of their partnership.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the passage is that AOL's original growth expectations are likely to be unmet.



"
"Ke batho ba le bakae ba ba bolailweng mo tlhaselong, ba e neng e se mapodisi?","The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The question states: ""Ofisi ya boeteledipele ba re mo go ba le lesome le borobabongwe ja ba ba gobetseng e ne e le mapodisi."" This translates to ""The investigation office said that of the 19 people killed, 10 were police officers.""  Therefore, 19 people were killed in total, and 10 of them were police officers, meaning 9 were civilians. The question specifically asks how many *non-police* people were killed, which would be the remaining 9. However, among the provided options, 19 is the only answer that's close enough and doesn't clearly indicate the number of people who were killed as non-police. I believe there is a mistake in the provided answer options. 

However, if we have to choose from the given options, and assuming the question intends to ask about the total number of casualties (including both police and civilians), then the answer is 19 (police) + 9 (civilians) = 28, but this answer is not provided.  

Given the options, and the statement that 10 of the killed were police, we can deduce that the remaining 19 were not police. Thus, the most reasonable answer, considering the provided options, is **A: 19**.



"
Ke mang yo o begileng mmelaelwa mo tlhaselong?,"The correct answer is **A: Mapodise (Police)**.

The question states: ""maabane mo mosong e ne ya bolaya mapodise a le mabedi..."" which translates to ""in the attack, two police officers were killed..."". Therefore, the police were the ones targeted and killed in the attack.
"
"Ka ntlha ya maemo a Florida, a naga e e tsayang gotlhe fa e fenya,ke eng se se abetsweng Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **B: Tlhopho ya Lekoko la Republican**.

Here's why:

The question states that Florida's electoral votes, which are awarded to the winner of the state, are crucial for the Republican nomination. Romney won Florida, giving him a significant boost in the Republican nomination race.  The question asks what was *won* by Romney due to Florida's outcome.  That ""thing"" is the support of the Republican party.

"Go ya ka temana,Gingrich o bone diperesente di le kae tsa diboutu mo ditlhophong tsa go itlhophela ntlhopheng yo ba mo ratang?","The correct answer is **B: Diperesente di le 32**.

The text states: ""Mmueledi wa pele wa U.S. wa House Newt Gingrich o tshotse maemo a bobedi ka diperesente di le 32."" which translates to ""The leading U.S. House member Newt Gingrich came in second place with 32 percent.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mang a sa tswelelang ka bontlhopheng morago ga dipholo tsa khokhase?","The answer is **A: Gingrich**.

The passage states: ""Morago ga maduo a tswa, Gingrich o ile a akgola Santorum..."" This implies Gingrich was still in the race after the initial rounds of primaries and caucuses, while Bachmann dropped out. Perry was also eliminated, and Romney remained. Therefore, Gingrich is the one who continued on."
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo o tlotlomaditseng ntlhopheng yo mongwe morago ga dipholo tsa khokhase?","The correct answer is **A: Bachmann**.

The passage states: ""Bachmann, who had won the Ames Straw Poll in August, then announced her withdrawal from the race."" This indicates she was the one who dropped out after the early primaries.
"
Lefelo le le lengwe fela foo lenaneo le neng le bontshiwa pele ga 2015 e ne e le kae?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The text states: ""Kwa tshimologong, lenaneo leno le ne le gasiwa fela mo tsebeng ya nthanete ya seromanowa sa Toginet..."" which translates to ""Initially, the program was only broadcast on the internet radio of TogiNet...""

While AstroNet Radio was a later development, the initial broadcast was on TogiNet's internet radio.
"
Seteišene se tlhalosa lenaneo jaaka le le sekametseng letlhakoreng lefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Magogorwane (Bacteria)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kwa tshimologong, thulaganyo e, e ne e tlhagisa batshameki ba mantswe ba bogogorwane ba ba tswang botlhaba ba Texas."" which translates to ""Initially, the program broadcast messages to bacterial communities coming from North Texas.""
"
"David Headley o kokoantse eng e, mo bofelong, e thusitseng tlhaselo ka setlhopha sa balwelakgololosego?","The correct answer is **C: Borradithunya (Intelligence)**.

The passage states: ""Go sekaseka le go batla tshedimosetso ga ga David Headley go ne ga tlela mosola borraditlhobolo ba le 10 ba setlhopha sa batlhabani sa Pakistani, Lakshar-e-Taiba.""  This translates to: ""The investigation and search for information from David Headley led to the arrest of 10 terrorists from the Pakistani militant group, Lakshar-e-Taiba.""

Therefore, intelligence (borradithunya) was crucial in identifying and apprehending the terrorists involved.
"
Ke mokgwa ofe wa dipalangwa o o neng o dirisiwa ke setlhopha sa balwelakgololosego go tsaya loeto go ya kwa Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **A: Seporo sa diterena (Trains)**.

The text states that the attackers arrived in Mumbai by boat. While not explicitly mentioned in the options, the context implies they used boats to reach the city. Considering the options provided, and knowing the attack involved multiple locations, it's highly probable that the attackers used boats to infiltrate Mumbai. Train is not a plausible mode of transport for terrorists aiming to attack multiple locations simultaneously in a city. 

Therefore, the best answer among the choices is **A: Seporo sa diterena**, as it's the only one remotely related to the initial arrival method described in the text (even if it's not directly stated). It's a distractor designed to test understanding of the main event described.
"
"Ke mafoko afe a a bontshang ka go nepagala,dipholo tsa motshameko wa Nadal le Raonic tsa Brisbane Open, tse di umakilweng mo temaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Raonic o fentse Nadal**.

The passage explicitly states: ""O fentswe mo malobeng ke Raonic kwa Brisbane Open."" which translates to ""He was defeated by Raonic at the Brisbane Open.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Raonic o ne a na le diperesente di le 88 tsa dintlha mo motshamekong:** While this is true, it doesn't describe who won the match.
*   **C: Nadal o fentse Raonic:** This is the opposite of what the passage says.
*   **D: Raonic o korile dintlha di le 76:** This refers to Nadal's points won, not who won the match.



"
"Go ya ka temana, kemo ya motshameko wa Nadal le Raonic e ne e le jang morago ga go thankgololwa?","The correct answer is **A: Raonic o ne a na le diperesente di le 88 tsa dintlha mo motshamekong**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Nadal o kgobokantse dintlha tsa 88% mo motshamekong..."" which translates to ""Nadal won 88% of the points in the match..."" This means Raonic won the remaining 12% and therefore had 88% of the points.
* Option B is incorrect because 76 is the number of points Nadal won, not the percentage of points Raonic won.
* Option C is the score of the match, not the points won by each player.
* Option D is incorrect because the text says Nadal defeated Raonic.



"
"Ke lenaneo lefe la puo, le le sa akaretswang mo dikgasong tsa ntha tse tharo tsa Naked News?","The correct answer is **A: Se-Italy**.

The question states that Naked News is adding three new shows featuring Spanish, Italian, and Korean content. Therefore, Italian is one of the languages included.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae foo dikgaso tsa Naked News tse disha di ka se bonweng gone?","The correct answer is **B: Inthanete**.

Here's why:

* The question states that Naked News has launched three new channels. 
* The text doesn't mention television, magazines, or newspapers.
* Naked News is known for its online presence, particularly through websites and streaming platforms.

Therefore, the most logical place to find the new channels would be **the internet**.
"
Ke bagaisani ba ba kae ba ba sa fetsang Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **A: 36**.

The passage states: ""Mo bataboging ba le lekgolo le metso e lesome le borataro le borataro ga ba kgona go fetsa lobelo. Mo kgaisanyong e nngwe ya gagwe, Giant Slalom, o ne a o fetsa a le wa bolesome mo motabogong wa bomme ka dinako tsa 4:41.30... Basadi ba le bane mo motshamekong wa skii wa basadi ba paletswe ke go fetsa...""

This indicates that 36 athletes did not finish the Giant Slalom race. The 117 is the total number who started, and the 45 is the number who were placed.  The question asks how many *failed* to finish.
"
"Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang, e e bontshang ka go nepagala,dipholo tsa mabelo kwa Bommampoding?","The correct answer is **A: Mo lobelong lwa bobedi, Carpenado o feditse pele ga motshameki wa skii wa kwa Hungary.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Mo kgaisanyong e nngwe ya gagwe, Giant Slalom, o ne a o fetsa a le wa bolesome mo motabogong wa bomme ka dinako tsa 4:41.30, a siilwe ke mofenyi wa mo-Australia, Claudia Loeshh ka metsotso ele 2:11.60 e bile a siilwe ke yo feditseng mo maemong a borobonngwe, Gyöngyi Dani wa Hungary, ka metsotso e le 1:09.02."" This directly indicates Carpenado finished ahead of Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary in the Giant Slalom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Batshameki ba skii ba le 45, ga baa fetsa metshameko ya bona mo Giant Slalom:** The text says 45 skiers were *ranked* in Giant Slalom, not that they *finished* their races.
* **C: Batshameki ba motshameko wa skii ba le bantsi ba feditse Giant Slalom go na le Slalom:** The text doesn't provide a comparison of the number of finishers between Giant Slalom and Slalom.
* **D: Carpenado o bone maemo a bolesome mo Slalom:** The text says Carpenado finished *second* in Slalom, not that he had a good position.



"
Ke ofe wa ba ba latelang yo NBA e sweditseng go mo sekega?,"The correct answer is **C: Motshameki mongwe le mongwe yo go tlhomamisitsweng gore o na le COVID-19** (A player who tested positive for COVID-19).

The text explicitly states: ""Tshweetso ya ba NBA e tla morago fa mongwe wa batshameki ba Utah Jazz a tshwarwa ka mogare wa COVID-19."" This translates to ""The NBA's return will come after a player from the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.""

Therefore, it was a **player** who tested positive, not the entire team or just a specific position.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se neng sa dira gore go nne le matshwenyego mo NBA mabapi le mogare?","The correct answer is **D: Go tlhomamisitswe gore motshameki wa Utah Jazz o na le mogare.**

The passage states: ""Tshweetso ya ba NBA e tla morago fa mongwe wa batshameki ba Utah Jazz a tshwarwa ka mogare wa COVID-19."" This directly indicates that a player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19. Option D reflects this information.

While option B is *related* to the correct answer, it's not as precise. The passage focuses on *one* player testing positive, not just a few players. Options A and C are incorrect because the passage doesn't mention the team being quarantined or the player performing poorly.
"
Ke mang yo o nositseng nno e e tlisitseng phenyo mo motshamekong wa Washington Capitals kgatlhanong le Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The question states: ""O Ovechkin o simolotse ka go thusa Nicklas Backstrom go nosa sego joo."" which translates to ""Ovechkin started by helping Nicklas Backstrom score that goal.""
"
Ke mang yo a nositseng nno ya gagwe ya bo 60 ya paka mo motshamekong wa Capitals kgatlhanong le Thrashers ?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The question specifically asks who scored his 60th career goal *in that particular game* against the Thrashers. The text states that Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th career goal in that game.
"
Banka ya Northern Rock e tlhokile neng tshegetso go tswa kwa pusong?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka nako ya mathata a tuelo ya matlo**.

The text states: ""Banka ya Northern Rock e ne kile ya kopa thuso mabapi le manokonoko a seru se se neng se wetse bareki ba mantlo ka 2007."" This directly links the need for assistance to problems with mortgage defaults (tuelo ya matlo). While the bank was eventually rescued, the initial need for help stemmed from these issues.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Morago ga gore banka e dirwe ya bosetšhaba:**  This describes a later event, not the initial reason for seeking help.
* **B: Fa banka e kgaogana le setheo sa tsamaiso ya dithuo:** While the bank *was* restructured, the underlying problem was the mortgage defaults.
* **C: Morago ga fa Virgin group e reka banka:** Virgin's acquisition was a *result* of the bank's troubles, not the cause of the initial need for help.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke afe a mafoko ano, a a tlhalosang ka nepagalo, tirisano ya Virgin Group le banka ya Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **A: Virgin Group, gape, e rekile setheo sa tsamaiso ya dithuo ya Northern Rock.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ikopelo ya setlhamo sa ga Sir Richard Branson sa Virgin Group go reka banka eo, e ne ya ganwa pele fa e tsewa ke puso. Ka 2010, fa e ne e le ya puso, banka ya ga jaana ya mmila o mogolo ya Northern Rock plc e ne ya kgaoganngwa le """"banka e e bosula"""", Northern Rock (Asset Management). Virgin o rekile """"banka e e molemo"""" fela ya Northern Rock, seng kopone ya tlhokomelo dithoto."" This clearly indicates Virgin Group bought the asset management side of Northern Rock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Virgin Group e rekile banka morago ga gore e dirwe ya bosetšhaba:** While Virgin *did* buy a part of Northern Rock after it was nationalized, the text specifies they bought the asset management part, *not* the entire bank.
* **C: Virgin Group e ile ya neela banka tshegetso ya potlako ka nako ya mathata a tuelo ya matlo:**  The text doesn't mention Virgin providing quick assistance during the mortgage crisis. It only details their purchase of a portion of the bank.
* **D: Virgin Group e ne ya tlhagisa gore e ka reka banka ka bokae morago ga fa e se na go diriwa banka ya bosetšhaba:** The text doesn't mention Virgin offering a price for the bank after nationalization. It states they *did* buy a specific part of it.



"
"Jaaka go tlhalositswe mo temaneng, ke setšhaba sefe se se angwang ke go saeniwa ga tumalano ya Kyoto ya maemo a bosa ?","The correct answer is **C: Australia**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Puso ya pele ya boratangwao ya Australia e ganne go dumalana le Kyoto..."" (The first government of Australia refused to agree to Kyoto...).
"
Puso ya pele ya Australia e ne e akanya gore go dumalana ka go saena ga Kyoto go ka senya eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Itsholelo ya lefatshe**.

The passage states: ""Puso ya pele ya boratangwao ya Australia e ganne go dumalana le Kyoto, e supa fa leano le le tla senya itsholelo ya lefatshe e e ikaegileng ka go rekisa magala...""  This directly indicates that the Australian government believed refusing to sign Kyoto would harm global efforts to combat climate change (itsholelo ya lefatshe).
"
"Bahudi ba ba neng ba le mo tselaneng, ba ne ba thapetswe lenaneo lefe?","The correct answer is **B: Mananeo a Pabalelo ya Tsa Tlhago le Ngwaoboswa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka tshwaragano ya ba NPWS le ba mokgatlho wa bahudi ba Australia (NSW), baithaopi ba ba maleba ba ne ba thapiwa, ka lenaneo la go tsoma la mokgatlho wa motshameko wa bahudi.""  This translates to: ""Through a meeting of NPWS and the Jewish Organisation of Australia (NSW), veteran shooters were offered a relocation program by a Jewish advocacy organization.""

The text also mentions Mick O'Flynn from NPWS and the fact that four Jewish shooters received full protection and support to join the core management of controlling dangerous wildlife.  This indicates the program was related to wildlife control and likely offered by an organization focused on endangered species and conservation. While NPWS was involved in the meeting, the program itself was an advocacy program for conservation.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lenaneo la Australia la Sporting Shooters Association:** The text doesn't mention the Sporting Shooters Association.
*   **C: Lenaneo la NPWS:** While NPWS was involved in the meeting, the *program* wasn't directly a NPWS program. It was offered through a Jewish advocacy group.
*   **D: Lenaneo la botsomi la Sporting Shooters Association:** This option isn't mentioned in the text.

"
"Ke mafoko afe a a sa bontsheng ka nepagalo,teko ya go laola disenyi?","The correct answer is **B: Bahudi ba ne ba bona taelo ya thupiso.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the Jewish people were placed under the protection of wildlife experts and that a specific agreement was established to secure their protection.**  Option B, ""Bahudi ba ne ba bona taelo ya thupiso"" (The Jewish people saw a protection order), is **not mentioned** in the text. The passage focuses on the establishment of a protection framework, not the Jewish people *seeing* an order.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **C: Bahudi ba beilwe leitlho ke batlhokomedi ba diphologolo:** The passage explicitly states this: ""...ba ne ba beilwe leitlho ke batlhokomedi ba dipholologo..."" ( ...they were placed under the protection of wildlife experts...)
* **A: Ka fa e ne e le tekeletso ya lenaneo, ga le a ka la sekasekiwa:** This is implied. The passage says an agreement was established to secure protection, suggesting it was a framework that could be reviewed.
* **D: Bahudi ba le bane ba ne ba tlhophiwa:** The passage states that four Jewish people were *selected* or *chosen* to participate in the management framework. This is close to the meaning of ""tlhophiwa"" (chosen).



Therefore, the only option that is *not* explicitly stated in the passage is B.



"
"Go ya ka temana, kgaogano e diragetse neng?","The correct answer is **C: Mo bosuping ba dimolekhule (In the context of molecular evidence)**.

The text states: ""go supega go re go kgaogana go diragetse pele ga nako e neng e akantswe fa go lebilwe bosupi jwa di-molecule."" This translates to ""it is surprising that the agreement happened before the time when molecular evidence was found."" Therefore, the agreement (the ""kgaogano"") happened in the context of the discovery of molecular evidence.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rift Valley:**  Rift Valley is a *location* where the discovery of the agreement happened, not the time itself.
* **B: Mo bonelong ja matlapa a bogologolo (In the context of large bones):** While the sentence mentions large bones, the focus of the agreement's timing is specifically tied to the *discovery of molecular evidence*.
* **D: Kwa Ethiopia (In Ethiopia):** Ethiopia is a *location* where the research was conducted, not the time itself.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se diragetseng ka bonako go feta ka fa go neng go lebeletswe ka teng?","The correct answer is **A: Thibololo ya bonelo ja matlapa a bogologolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fa go go remeletswe mo bonelong ja matlapa a bogologolo, go supega go re go kgaogana go diragetse pele ga nako e neng e akantswe fa go lebilwe bosupi jwa di-molecule.""  This translates to: ""When the fossils are examined, it turns out that the evolution happened before the time that was assumed when evidence of molecules was expected.""

This means the *timing* of the evolution of these fossils is earlier than scientists predicted based on the expected molecular evidence.  The passage highlights that the *thibololo* (thoroughness/unexpectedness) of the fossil findings is what's significant.
"
Motshameki o tla tlhoka go dira eng gore a laole dikgato le metsamao mo motshamekong wa bidio?,"The correct answer is **D: Sutisa sediriswa se mo moweng.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""It will allow players to control actions in video games by translating their movements into signals."" This directly indicates that the player needs to *translate their movements into signals*, which is accomplished by *sutisa sediriswa se mo moweng* (translating movements into signals).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Netefatsa gore disensara tsa molaodi di beilwe gaufi le khonsole:**  While proximity is important, the crucial action isn't just the placement of the sensors.
* **B: Go kgaoganya lefelo le mo go lone seraro:** This describes a function of the sensors, not what the player *does* to control the game.
* **C: Baya disensara gaufi le thelebišene:** The sensors need to be near the TV, but the main action is about translating the player's movements.



"
Ke eng se se dirilweng gore se tshwane le selaola thelebišene?,"The correct answer is **A: Disensara tse pedi tsa selaodi**.

Here's why:

The article explicitly states: ""Go tshwana le selaola thelebishene, selaodi se dirisa disensara tse pedi tse di beilweng gaufi le modirisi wa thelebishene...""  (Similar to a TV remote, the console uses two sensors placed close to the television...)  The two sensors are the key element that makes the Nintendo Revolution console similar to a TV remote.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Selaodi sa Nintendo Revolution:** This is *what* is similar, but not *what* makes it similar. It's the device itself.
* **C: Puo ya setlhogo:** This refers to the article's content, not a component of the console's functionality.
* **D: Khonsole ya Nintendo Revolution:** Same as B – the console itself, not the specific feature.



"
Ke eng se se neng se sa buiwa mo pegong ya moragonyana ya ditheo tsa dikgang tsa Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Sefofane se ne sa kotama mo Ürümqi.**

Here's why:

The question asks what wasn't mentioned in the *later* reports from Xinhua. The text states that later reports said the plane was met with fuel and then taken to Afghanistan and crashed in Kandahar.  However, the *initial* reports (mentioned at the beginning) state the plane was met with fuel *after* refusing to land in Ürümqi. Therefore, the fact that it refused to land in Ürümqi and was met with fuel *before* being taken to Afghanistan is what was *not* mentioned in the later reports.

Let's break down the other options:

*   **A: Sefofane se ne se amogetse matshosetsi a bomo:** This *was* mentioned in the later reports.
*   **C: Sefofane se ile sa busetswa morago kwa Afghanistan:** This *was* mentioned in the later reports.
*   **D: Sefofane se ne sa kotama kwa Kandahar:** This *was* mentioned in the later reports.



"
Ke eng seo se neng se sa buiwa mo pegong ya ntlha ya ditheo tsa dikgang tsa Xinhua ?,"The correct answer is **B: Sefofane se ne sa ganediwa go kotama ga tshoganyetso**.

Here's why:

* The Xinhua report initially stated the plane was seized with drugs.
* The subsequent reports from other countries mention the plane was refused permission to land in Ürümqi, leading to the diversion to Afghanistan and eventual crash in Kandahar.
* Option B directly addresses the information *not* in the initial Xinhua report - the refusal of landing permission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sefofane se ne sa gapiwa ka dikgoka:** This *is* mentioned in the Xinhua report.
* **C: Sefofane se ne sa busediwa morago kwa Afghanistan:** This *is* mentioned in the Xinhua report and the later reports.
* **D: Sefofane se ne sa amogetse matshosetsi a bomo:** This *is* mentioned in the Xinhua report.



"
Ke eng se se neng sa phatlhaladiwa ke Sara Danius mo thulaganyong ya seromamowa?,"The correct answer is **B: Komiti ga e a bona diphetolo go tswa go ba ba dirisanang thata le ene**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what Sara Danius *investigated* in the radio interview.
* The text states: ""Leditse ke be ke romela melaetsa ya e-mail ko go ba ba dirisanang thata le ene ka bo ke amogela diphetolo tse di solofetsang. Ga jaana se se selekane."" This translates to: ""I was sending emails to those who were in close contact with him, and I was receiving promising developments. That's not the case anymore.""
* This indicates that she was investigating the *lack* of developments or changes in the situation regarding the committee's efforts to engage with Bob Dylan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mofenyi wa Sekgele sa tsa Bokwadi sa Nobel:** While she *is* the Secretary of the Swedish Academy for Literature, the question asks what she *investigated*, not her position.
* **C: Batlhophiwa ba 2016 ba Sekgele sa Bokwadi sa Nobel:**  The interview focuses on the *process* of selecting the Nobel laureate, not the laureate themselves.
* **D: Komiti e tla emisa maiteko a go ikgolaganya le Bob Dylan:** The text implies the opposite - the efforts were *ongoing* and then stalled.



"
Ke mang yo go neng go pala go mo fitlhelela?,"The correct answer is **A: Yo o dirisanang le Bob Dylan thata (Those who are close to Bob Dylan)**.

The text states: ""Ke leditse ke be ke romela melaetsa ya e-mail ko go ba ba dirisanang thata le ene ka bo ke amogela diphetolo tse di solofetsang."" This translates to ""I sent emails to those who are close to him, as I welcomed the promised changes.""  Therefore, it was the people close to Bob Dylan who were being contacted.



"
"Ke mang a rebotseng maitlamo, a re ke “kgatelopele”?","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The question specifically asks who *reported* the sentiment. The text states, ""Moanamisa mafoko wa ga Bush, Gordon Johndroe o rebotse maitlamo a Korea bokone..."" which translates to ""Translating Bush's words, Gordon Johndroe said that North Korea..."".  Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who reported the sentiment and used the term ""kgatelopele"".
"
Ke ditempe di le kae tse Słania a di diretseng dinaga tse dingwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Go ka feta 2,000**

The passage states: ""O diretse lefatshe la Sweden ditempe di ka feta 1,000 le dinaga tse dingwe di le 28."" This translates to: ""He created temples in Sweden exceeding 1,000 and in other countries 28."" Therefore, the total number of temples is more than 1,000 + 28 = 1,028.  Since the question asks about temples in *other* countries, and the passage mentions 28, and the total is over 1000, it's reasonable to infer that the number of temples in other countries is more than 2,000. 
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka bong se baka go dutla mo go tswelelang ga tanka ya letsha?","The correct answer is **C: Go buduloga ga sediriswa se se laolang botsididi le molelo mo teng ga tanka.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tanka ya letsha e ne ntse e dutla, gongwe e le ka ntlha ya go buduloga ga sedirisiwa se se laolang botsididi le molelo mo teng ga tanka.""  This directly links the tank's stillness to the malfunction of the control system for pressure and level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lefelo la bobedi la bobolokelo le a tladiwa, ebile le a tshologa:** The text doesn't mention any failure in the secondary protection system.
* **B: Diteko tsa ka gale tsa motšhini o o laolang molelo:** While failed tests *led* to the problem, the text identifies the *malfunction of the control system* as the direct cause of the tank's stillness. The tests are the *reason* for the understanding of the problem.
* **D: Mollo kwa nngwe ya di- Fort Greely pump station:**  The text focuses on the tank itself, not a problem at the pump station.

Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the provided text.
"
Goreng di-valve di ile di a bulega?,"The correct answer is **B: Go ne ga nna le kgaogo ya motlakase fa morago ga teko ya ka gale ya motshini o o laolang molemo.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Go kgaoga ga motlakase go go diregileng morago ga diketo tsa ka gale tsa motshini o o laolang molelo di bakile gore di-valve di bulege..."" which translates to ""Electricity, coming after the results of a test of the control system, caused the valves to open...""



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ne ga nna le go buduloga ga sediriswa se se laolang botsididi le molemo mo teng ga tanka** - While a malfunction *might* be a factor, the passage directly links the valve opening to the electricity from the control system test.
* **C: Ditanka di ne di tletse sentle** - The passage indicates the tank was empty at the time of the leak.
* **D: Setsholadilwana sa bobedi se se neng se tshotse dibarele di le 104, 500 jwa ditanka se ne se ise se tlale sentle** - The passage mentions the leak *before* the second spill occurred and doesn't state anything about the tank's condition prior to the first valve opening.



"
"Ga jaana, metsi a kwa Wateng ya borobongwe, a tsamaya go fitlha kae?","The correct answer is **D: Dikgato di le 100**.

The text states: ""Metsi a tshologelela kwa ntle ga nokana ya bophara ja100."" which translates to ""Water spread outside the levee by 100 feet.""  While the other options mention distances, they don't accurately reflect where the water *actually* spread.
"
"Ka nako ya Kgwanyape ya Katrina, go diragetse eng mo Wateng ya borobongwe?","The correct answer is **A: Metsi a tshologela kwa ntle ga nokana ya bophara ja 100**.

The text explicitly states: ""Metsi a tshologelela kwa ntle ga nokana ya bophara ja 100."" (Water overflowed outside the levee by 100 feet).  While the other options are mentioned, they don't directly address what *happened* to the water in the levee during Hurricane Katrina.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e neng e sa tlhomamisiwa ke Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **D: Maemo a gajaana a molwetse (Severity of the illness)**.

Here's why:

The question states that Hamilton was recognized for his expertise in managing epidemics, traveling to Nigeria during the Ebola outbreak, and implementing strategies for disease control and patient management.  The other options align with this:

*   **A: Ko molwetse a kileng a tseela loeto teng (Having traveled to an affected area):** This directly relates to his experience in Nigeria.
*   **B: Kgonagalo ya balwetse ba bangwe ya go tshwaetswa ke mogare (The tendency of some patients to be contagious):** This is a critical aspect of managing an epidemic.
*   **C: Gore a tsamaiso e e tshwanetseng e ne e latetswe (That proper protocols were followed):** This refers to his work in implementing control measures.

However, the question asks what Hamilton *didn't* emphasize or consider.  While severity is a factor in managing an epidemic, the provided text doesn't say he *didn't* address it. The text focuses on control measures, logistics, and patient management.  The prompt implies he focused more on *how to manage the epidemic* rather than specifically categorizing the *severity* of the illness itself.



"
Ke eng sengwe se borasaense ba batlang go se tlhaloganya?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa dinaledi tsa motšhotšhonono di thulana le Lefatshe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dinaledi tsa motshotshonono di kile tsa thulana le Lefatshe bogologolo."" The question asks what else scientists want to understand. This directly connects to the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ka fa diporoteini di dirwang ka teng:** While protein synthesis is important, it's not directly mentioned as a current research focus in the passage.
* **C: Se dibodi e leng sone:** This is too vague and doesn't relate to the passage's content.
* **D: Ka fa Lefatshe le bopilweng ka teng:** The passage mentions the *origin* of Earth and the evolution of life, but not its current state of being ""alive.""



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke seabe sefe se mapodise a selegae se nnileng le sone mo go tswaleng?","The correct answer is **A: Ba ikuetse go FBI go tswalela**.

The passage states: ""Transportation Authority ya Maryland e ile ya tswalela ka go gakala ga mapodisa a FBI."" This means the Maryland Transportation Authority contacted the FBI to investigate.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba sweditse go tswalela:** This implies they went *to* the FBI, but the sentence structure indicates they *contacted* the FBI.
* **C: Ba ne ba kaela bakgweetsi ba dijanaga go ya ditseleng tse dingwe:** This is irrelevant to the initial action taken.
* **D: Ba begile tiego ya pharakano mo tseleng e nngwe:** While they anticipated congestion, the initial action was to involve the FBI in the investigation.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is A.
"
Go diragetse eng ka matseno a diphanele ka nako ya go tswala?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba ne ba thibelwa go tsena** (They were prevented from entering).

The passage states: ""Go na ga dirisiwa diteraka tsa matlakala go thiba dikgoro tsa teng"" which translates to ""Barriers were used to stop the vehicles that were coming."" This indicates the vehicles were prevented from entering the area.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se sa diragalang pele ga fa motsayaditshwantsho a thulwa ke sejanaga?","The correct answer is **B: Motsayaditshwantsho o ne a emisa sejanaga sa gagwe mo Sepulveda Boulevard.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bieber o ntshitse molaetsa a re, ”ntswa lefa ke ne se teng fa kotsi e ya matlhotlapelo e diragala, dikakanyo le dithapelo tsame di na le ba lelapa la motshwasetlhabelo.” Mafarathata a maranyane a dikgang a TMZ a re motsaya dinepe one a emisa koloi ya gagwe fa thoko ga Sepulveda Boulvelda...""

This directly indicates that the paparazzi found the driver *stopped* on Sepulveda Boulevard.  The other options are incorrect based on the provided text."
Motsayaditshwantsho o ne a leka go dira eng pele ga fa a thulwa ke sejanaga?,"The correct answer is **A: Emisa sejanaga mo Sepulveda Boulevard**.

The text states: ""Bieber o ntshitse molaetsa a re, ”ntswa lefa ke ne se teng fa kotsi e ya matlhotlapelo e diragala, dikakanyo le dithapelo tsame di na le ba lelapa la motshwasetlhabelo.” Mafarathata a maranyane a dikgang a TMZ a re motsaya dinepe one a emisa koloi ya gagwe fa thoko ga Sepulveda Boulvelda...""

This directly indicates that Bieber stopped his car on Sepulveda Boulevard."
"Ke mafoko afe a a sa tlhaloseng ka go nepagala, maemo a moporesidente morago ga fa go tlhomamisitswe gore o na le mogare?","The correct answer is **A: Ga a ikutlwe sentle** (He doesn't feel well).

The passage states: ""Ke ikutlwa sentle e bile ke siame go re ke dire tiro ya me ka kgolagano ya mogala."" which translates to ""I feel good and it's pleasant for me that I can do my work in a collaborative manner.""  This implies that *before* the announcement of his illness, he was feeling well. The question asks what's unclear or confusing. The most straightforward unclear point is that he *doesn't* feel well *after* the announcement, even though the phrasing might seem a bit indirect. Options B, C, and D don't directly relate to the implied sentiment of his current state.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, ka moporesidente, a e leng nnete?","The correct answer is **B: O tla nna a ntse kwa gae dibeke di le mmalwa** (He will be staying at home for a few weeks).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Seemo sa moporesidente se tlhomame, mme gone o tla nna a le nosi kwa legaeng la gagwe malatsi a le mmalwa."" This translates to: ""The presidential spokesperson confirmed that he will be staying at home for a few days.""  The options include ""dibeke"" (weeks) and ""malatsi"" (days). Since the spokesperson is confirming a period of time, ""dibeke di le mmalwa"" (a few weeks) is the closest and most accurate interpretation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga a na letshoroma** (He has no cold) - The text explicitly states he *does* have a cold (""o na le mogare"").
* **C: O ikutlwa sentle mo e leng gore a ka direla kwa gae** (He feels good about being able to rest at home) - While he says he feels good about being able to work collaboratively, the main reason he's staying home is due to illness, not because he feels good about resting.  The statement emphasizes collaborative work despite being sick.
* **D: O ne a na le mogare o o masisi** (He had a severe cold) - The text simply states ""mogare"" (a cold) without specifying severity. The statement is not confirmed.



"
"Go ya ka temana, Setsuatsue sa Boboatsatsi se se bidiwang Gonu se solofetswe go tswela pele se koafala neng?","The correct answer is **A: Pele o fitlha Maldives**.

The passage states: ""Mo mosong wa letsatsi leno, diphefo di ne di tsamaya ka lobelo la 83km/h, mme go solofetswe go re seemo se tla tswelela go tokafala."" This translates to ""On this day, the sharks were traveling at a speed of 83km/h, and it was predicted that the journey would take longer."" The prediction of a longer journey implies they haven't reached the Maldives yet.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The speed of 83km/h is mentioned as the speed *on that day*, not when the journey was predicted to take longer.
* **C:** The passage doesn't say anything about the shark reaching its destination.
* **D:** The speed of 149km/h is the maximum speed, not the speed at which the journey is predicted to take longer.
"
Diphefo di ne di le bonako bo bo kaakang fa Setsuatsue sa Boboatsatsi se se bidiwang Gonu se ne se le bogale thata?,"The correct answer is **B: Dimaele di le 240 ka ura**

Here's why:

The question asks about the speed of the Gonu when Setsuwatsue was considered to be in danger. The passage states: ""Fa se le ko setlhoweng, Setsuwatsuwe wa Gonu, se se teilweng ka kgetse ya matlhare a sethare sa di-palms mo puong ya se-Maldives, se ne se le diphefo tse di tsamayang ka lebelo la dikhilomithara di le 240 ka oura (dimmaele tse149 ka oura).""  This directly tells us the speed of the Gonu when it was in danger.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa tseweng jaaka mokgwa wa Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **B: E ka koafatsa ditshika tsa batho**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that red tide blooms are harmful to both marine life and humans.** It explicitly mentions that marine life can die from the toxins produced.
* **While the passage implies humans can be affected by consuming contaminated seafood, it doesn't directly state that red tide *can* kill marine life.** It says marine life *can die* from the toxins.
* **The passage *does* mention that red tide blooms are caused by the Karenia brevis algae (which are single-celled organisms).**
* **The passage *does* state that red tide blooms are caused by natural conditions.**



Therefore, option B is the statement that is *not* directly supported by the text.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang tseo Karena brevis a sa kgoneng go di dira?,"The correct answer is **C: Ama metsi**.

Here's why:

* The text states that *Karenia brevis* is responsible for red tides which can produce toxins that kill fish and marine life.
* The text *doesn't* say that *Karenia brevis* can *consume* water (ama metsi). It produces toxins that have a harmful effect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Koafatsa ditshika mo tlhaping:** The text explicitly states that red tides kill fish.
* **B: Oketsega mo palong ka bonako mo maemong mangwe le mangwe:** The text says that red tides can trigger similar conditions, implying they can spread.
* **D: Tlhagisa botlhole bo bo tlhaselang dinyurone:**  The text says the toxins produced cause the red tide to produce toxins that kill fish and can affect humans by causing respiratory issues. While it doesn't specifically state it damages neurons, it aligns with the overall effect of the toxin.

Therefore, the only option *Karenia brevis* is explicitly stated *not* to do is consume water.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa diragalang ka ntlha ya Kgwanyape e e bidiwang Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: Morwalela wa mo mmileng (Waterborne disease)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states, ""mme le go fitlha gompieno, ga go na tshenyo kgotsa morwalela ope o o begilweng"" which translates to ""and as of today, there are no injuries or illnesses reported."" This directly contradicts the possibility of a waterborne disease outbreak.

The other options are plausible based on the description of the storm:

*   **A: Go na ga pula go go solegelang molemo (There is rain that is beneficial)** - While the storm brought heavy rain, the text doesn't say it was beneficial.
*   **B: Go na ga pula, go tsamaya le tumo ya maru (There is rain, it comes with a rainbow)** -  Rainstorms can sometimes be followed by rainbows.
*   **C: Legadima le le ipoapoeletsang (Flash floods)** - The text mentions flash floods as one of the potential consequences.



"
"Ke mafoko afe ka Kgwanyape e e bidiwang Felicia, a e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Pula e e feletsang e na, e ne ya ungwela Oahu**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Masalela a yone a tsisitse pulanyana mo ditlhakatlhakeng tse ka bontsi, mme le go fitlha gompieno, ga go na tshenyo kgotsa morwalela ope o o begilweng.""  This implies the storm *did not* make landfall on Oahu.
* **The text states:** ""Pula ya teng, e e kaeilweng e gorogile mo selekanyang sa di-inch di le 6.34, mo selakanyetsing sengwe ko Oahu, go tlhalositswe ”e le mosola”."" This confirms the storm was *near* Oahu, but not on it.

Therefore, the statement that the storm made landfall on Oahu is false.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Santlha, e ne e tlhaotswe jaaka boboatsatsi ba diphefo tsa lobelo lo lo kwa tlase, pele ga fa e fetoga go nna setsuwele sa Setlhopha 4:** The text explicitly says this.
* **C: Bontsi ba setlhaketlhake bo itemogetse pula:** The text states the storm caused thunderstorms, which is accurate.
* **D: Pula nngwe e ne e tsamaya le legadima:** The text mentions thunderstorms and heavy rain, which are both forms of precipitation.



"
"Ke mafoko afe a a bontshang ka nepagalo,dipoelo tsa Grand Prix ya Hungary ya 2009?","The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. o ne a lebogiswa tiro morago ga foo (Piquet Jr. was demoted after that).**

The text explicitly states: ""Piquet Jr o kobiwa morago ga tikologo ya Hungary ya 2009."" This means he was penalized, or demoted, as a consequence of the incident.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fernando Alonso o ne a amega mo kotsing (Fernando Alonso was in danger):** While Alonso was involved in the accident, the text focuses on Piquet Jr.'s actions and consequences.
*   **B: Piquet Jr. o fentse (Piquet Jr. won):** The text says he was *penalized*, not that he won.
*   **D: Sejanaga sa pabalesego se ne sa amega mo kotsing (The safety car appeared during the accident):** While a safety car *did* appear, the question asks about what happened at the Hungary Grand Prix 2009 related to Piquet Jr.'s demotion."
Thulano e diragetse neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Fa dikoloi tse dingwe di ne di tshelwa mafura** (When the other cars were being pitted).

Here's why: The text states that because the other cars were pitting (being serviced), Piquet Jr. was able to overtake and then crash. This directly connects the crash to the pitting period of the other cars.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tsereng nako e nnye go feta ka fa babatlisisi ba neng ba dumela peleng?","The correct answer is **D: Go iphetogela ga mefuta e e farologaneng ya ditshedi (Adaptive radiation)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the new finch species arose from the beak adaptations of Darwin's finches, Geospiza finches, and Goespiza conirostris finches. This indicates a process of diversification driven by adaptation to different food sources. 
* **Adaptive radiation** is the evolutionary process where a single ancestral species rapidly diversifies into many new forms, each adapted to a different ecological niche. This perfectly describes the scenario outlined in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Popo ya mefuta e e farologaneng ya ditshedi (Speciation of diverse finches):** While speciation (the formation of new species) *happened*, the passage focuses on the *pattern* of diversification, not just the occurrence of new species.
* **B: Pego ka mefuta e e farologaneng ya ditshedi (Evolution of diverse finches):** Evolution is a broad term. Adaptive radiation is a *specific type* of evolution.
* **C: Go tsadisa magareng ga mefuta e e farologaneng ya ditshedi (Ecological isolation of diverse finches):**  While ecological isolation *can* lead to speciation, the passage doesn't emphasize isolation as the primary driver. It highlights adaptation to different food sources.



Therefore, **Adaptive radiation** is the most accurate description of the evolutionary process described in the passage.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e neng e sa begiwa ke babatlisisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Leina la mofuta o montšhwa wa ditshedi (Name of the new species of finch)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the scientists *did* discover a new species of finch. Options A and B are directly supported by the text. The passage mentions the location where the finches were found and the evolutionary context.

However, the passage *doesn't* state what the new species is *called*.  It only refers to it as a new species.

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
CowParade e tla diriwa kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Mo toropong ya Bucharest**.

The text explicitly states: ""Moletlo wa bodiragatsi ke ntlha nngwe ya ipapatso ke ba Bucharest City Hall..."" which translates to ""The event is one of the reasons for the partnership being with Bucharest City Hall..."" and ""...toropo e tla nna ya ntlha mo borwa-botlhaba jwa Yuropa go ka tshwara moletlo wa CowParade..."" which translates to ""...the city will be a starting point in northwestern Europe to host the CowParade event..."".  This means the event is primarily taking place in Bucharest.
"
"Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang e e tlhalosang ka nepagalo, CowParade?","The correct answer is **D: Ke tiragalo ya bosetšhaba ya botaki e e kgolo go di gaisa mo lefatsheng.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...tiragalo e kgolo ya lefatshe ya botaki magare ga kgwedi ya Seetebosigo le Phatwe monongwaga."" This directly translates to ""a large international art event held around the time of Christmas and New Year each year.""
* Option D accurately reflects this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E diragala fela mo diteropong tse di tsewang jaaka tse di “nang le bokgoni ba go itlhamela dilo”** - While CowParade *does* happen in cities that are ""open to inspiration,"" the text doesn't state this as the defining characteristic.
* **B: E ne ya tlhamiwa ke Bucharest City Hall** - The text says the Bucharest City Hall *wants to start* a CowParade, not that they created it.
* **C: Ke tiragalo ya botaki e e tshwarwang selemo go ralala borwabotlhaba ba Yuropa** - The text states it's a yearly event, not happening every year for a whole year.



"
Ke eng se se bakileng gore Russia e sekege tiriso ya di II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Kotsi**.

The text explicitly states: ""Naga ya Russia e ne ya emisa metsamao yo difofane tsotlhe tsa modiro wa II-76 ka nakwana morago ga kotsi eo."" (The Russian government suspended all flights of the Il-76 mod after that accident.)

While the other options might be related, the direct cause mentioned is the accident.
"
II-76 ke eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Motšhini o o fofang (Turboprop)**.

The text states: ""Il-76 e ntse e le karolo e kgolo ya sesole sa ko Russia le sa Soviet Union go tsweng dingwageng tsa bo-1970... Naga ya Russia e ne ya emisa metsamao yo difofane tsotlhe tsa modiro wa II-76 ka nakwana morago ga kotsi eo."" 

This indicates that the Il-76 is a type of aircraft (""modiro wa II-76"") that uses turboprop engines (""difofane"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sekepe sa ntwa sa ka fa tlase ga metsi (Submarine):** The text clearly describes an aircraft.
* **B: Tanka (Tank):** Tanks are land-based military vehicles, not aircraft.
* **D: Terena (Train):** Trains are a form of ground transportation, not aircraft.



"
Ke mang a thapileng setlhopha sa bakwadi sa The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

The text states that Simon worked with Brooks *and* Groening to create The Simpsons. Therefore, Groening is a key member of the writing team.
"
"Go ya ka Fluke, ke mang a neng a mo romela ditshwaelo tse di molemo le thotloetso?","The correct answer is **D: Batho ba borre le bomme**. 

The question states the flyers were sent by ""men and women of renown"". Therefore, the answer is ""men and women"".
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo batho bangwe ba sa batleng basadi ba bua kgatlhanong le sone?","The correct answer is **B: Ditshenyegelo tsa kalafi (Health concerns)**.

The text states that the survey revealed that many people are reluctant to discuss their sexual history because of health concerns. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided information.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke polanete efe e e nang le maatla go feta?","The correct answer is **A: Lefatshe**.

The text states: ""Go ya ka kitso ya rona, go na le setlhopha sa dipolanete se se bontshang matlhagatlhaga go feta Titan, mme leina la yone ke Lefatshe."" which translates to ""According to our research, there is a group of planets that show exploration more than Titan, and its name is Earth.""  Therefore, the planet with more exploration than Titan is Earth.
"
"Dinoka le matsha, tse di nang le seedi se se bonalatsang di supilwe mo polaneteng efe?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go ya ka kitso ya rona, go na le setlhopha sa dipolanete se se bontshang matlhagatlhaga go feta Titan..."" This directly indicates that Titan is the planet with visible clouds and haze, and therefore the planet where icy moons with visible clouds and haze are found.
"
"Ke efe ya diphitlhelelo tseno, e e seng ka ntlha ya thibololo ya diphofa?","The correct answer is **C: Temoso ya go tlhaloganya go iphetogela ga diphofa (Evidence for the evolution of scales)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states, ""Diphhitlhelelo tse gape, di fa tshedimosetso ka ga diphuka tsa dinonyane di fetogileng ka teng mo tsamaong ya nako"" (Further evidence provides insights into the evolution of scales over time). This directly addresses the evolution of scales.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mmala wa diphuka tsa phologolo (Color of dinosaur scales):** The passage mentions color but doesn't highlight it as a key piece of evidence *separate* from the scale evolution.
* **B: Go tlhaloganya gore diphofa di ne di sa dirisiwa mo phofong (Determining that scales were not used for locomotion):** While the passage discusses the function of scales, it's not presented as a distinct piece of *evolutionary* evidence, but rather a description of their function.
* **D: Tlhomamiso ya gore di-dinosaur tse dintsi di ne di na le diphofa (Conclusion that many dinosaurs had scales):** The passage doesn't conclude that *many* dinosaurs had scales. It refers to the evolution *of* scales from smaller reptiles.



"
Diphofa tsa di- dinosaur di ne di se na eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Rachis**.

The passage states: ""Ka gonne diphuka tsa dinosaur di sena dithupana tse di itekanetseng, tse di bidiwang di rachis...""  This directly identifies rachis as a feature of dinosaur bones.
"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang ka ZMapp e e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **B: E kgona go alafa ditshwaetsego tse di leng teng fela e sa thibele leso (It can only reduce symptoms but not prevent death).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Molemo mongwe, ZMapp o ne o solofetsa fa o dirisiwa, dipatlisiso tse di tseneletseng di ne tsa supa fa o sa thuse thata mo ke thibeleng loso.""  This means ZMapp didn't *prevent* death, but rather *reduced* the severity of the illness.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the passage:

* **A: E dirilwe ka dilwantshamalwetse (It was derived from primates):** The passage doesn't explicitly state this, but it is a well-known fact about ZMapp.
* **C: E dirile jaaka taolo mo tekong ya PALM (It was used as a control in the PALM trial):** The passage states that ZMapp was compared to three other potential treatments in the PALM trial. This suggests it was used as a treatment, not a control.
* **D: Tshekatsheko e bontsha gore ditshiamelo tsa yone di kwa tlase go na le ka fa go neng go akangwa ka teng mo tshimologong (The trial showed that its effectiveness was lower than it was initially hoped):** The passage states that ZMapp's effectiveness was comparable to the other three treatments in the PALM trial, indicating that initial hopes for its effectiveness may have been overly optimistic.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts information presented in the text.



"
"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang a a tlhalosang ka nepagalo,teko ya PALM?","The correct answer is **B: Seokobatsi se se ka fa tlase ga taolo e e gagametseng se ne sa bapiswa le dikalafi tse dingwe tse tharo, ZMapp e le e nngwe ya tsone.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Tshekatshekong ya PALM, ZMapp e ne e le one molemo o o neng o dirisiwa go tshwantshanya boleng ja melemo e meraro e mengwe."" (In the PALM trial, ZMapp was the one drug that was used to compare survival to three other drugs.)
* This directly indicates that ZMapp was one of four drugs being tested, and it was the control (or comparison) group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tshekatsheko e bontshitse gore e ka nne ya nna le ditshiamelo tse di fetang ka fa go neng go akantswe mo nakong e e fetileng** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: ZMapp e ne e dirisiwa jaaka mola wa motheo wa teko** - While ZMapp *was* a key part of the trial, the passage doesn't explicitly state it was the *main* drug being tested. It was being compared *to* other drugs.
* **D: E ne ya bontshiwa e dira sentle mo kalafong ya maemo a a leng teng** - The passage only states it was *compared* to other drugs; it doesn't say it performed well. It also highlights that even with ZMapp, there was no significant improvement.



"
Babatlisisi ba akanya gore tshitswana e ntšhwa e tla nna botlhokwa go gaisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Dinaga tse di nang le lotseno lo lo kwa tlase** (Low-cost countries).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...ko selekanyetso sa go fola mo malwetsing a a tshwanang le kankere ya mabele se ka nna sephatlo sa kwa mafatsheng a a tlhabologileng."" This translates to ""...the cost of treatment for diseases similar to breast cancer could be a solution for low-income countries.""

The passage emphasizes that the new printing technology could make healthcare more accessible in countries with limited resources.  Therefore, the technology is considered important for **low-cost countries**.
"
Ke mokgwa ofe o o tla dirisiwang go dira sediriswa sa tlhatlhobo?,"The correct answer is **B: Motšhini wa tlwaelo wa go gatisa wa inkjet**.

Here's why: The passage explicitly states: ""tshitswana e nnye fela thata e e ka bopiwang ka porintara fela a malatsi otlhe e e dirisang maranyane a inkjet...""  This means the device uses inkjet printing technology.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mafoko afe ka lobate scarps a e seng a nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Go nna gone ga tsone go kaya gore ngwedi ga o tlhaele tiro ya jioloji.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the lunar ""riblets"" (mekgokolosa e e boleta) are evidence *against* the idea that the Moon has undergone significant geological activity.  Option B directly reflects this: it says the riblets disprove the idea of the Moon having a geological history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ka direga gore ditiragalo tse di di tlhodileng, di bo di diragetse bošeng jaana:** While the passage mentions the formations are *likely* from ancient events, this doesn't mean they *prove* the Moon isn't geologically active. It's a possible explanation, not a direct refutation.
*   **C: Di ka nna ditlamorago tsa go ngotlega ga ngwedi:**  The passage doesn't mention meteor impacts as an explanation for the riblets.
*   **D: Ga di a bonwa ka bontsi mo boalong ba ngwedi:** This is irrelevant to whether they support or contradict geological activity.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kgopolo efe malebana le dipopego tse di farologaneng tsa lefatshe, e e supang gore go na le tiro ya jioloji e e diragalang mo ngweding?","The correct answer is **D: Dipopego tse di farologaneng tsa lefatshe di tlhodilwe bošeng jaana.**

Here's why:

* The passage describes lunar craters as being formed by impacts, indicating geological activity on the moon in the past.
* The passage specifically states this contradicts the idea that the moon is geologically dead.
* Option D directly reflects this idea that lunar craters are a sign of *past* geological activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngwedi o ngotlega ka bonya , ka bonya** - This is just a statement about lunar exploration and doesn't address the geological activity itself.
* **B: Dipopego tse di farologaneng tsa lefatshe di tlhodilwe bogologolo** - This is incorrect. The passage states the craters are *few* and indicate a recent decrease in activity.
* **C: Go na le palo e e kwa tlase fela ya dipopego tse di farologaneng tsa lefatshe mo boalong ba ngwedi** - While true based on the passage, option D provides a better and more comprehensive explanation of *why* the craters are significant (they indicate past geological activity).
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se ka se nneng teng ka bontsi go fitlhela go bonwa molato?","The correct answer is **C: Metlotlo ya bopaki jwa dipaki tse di boneng ka matlho.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""bosupi bope jwa batho ba ba boneng ka matlho bo ka tswa bo kgotletswe gonne senepe sa gagwe se anamisitswe thata."" This means the fingerprints found on the weapon are crucial evidence and the key to potentially securing a conviction.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ditshwaelo go ya pele:** While fingerprints are a type of evidence, ""ditshwaelo go ya pele"" (fingerprints are at the forefront) is not as specific as option C.
* **B: Dikgatiso tsa ditshwantsho:**  The passage mentions fingerprints specifically, not general fingerprint analysis.
* **D: Kgatiso ya Tiro e e kwadilweng:** The passage doesn't mention a written forensic report.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the key element leading to a potential conviction is the fingerprint evidence.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se e seng bothata gajaana go batshwari ba manyibi?","The correct answer is **A: Maemo a bosa a a boitshegang (Favorable weather conditions)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that unfavorable weather conditions make it difficult to manage water storage.
* It also mentions that water quantity and quality have been a challenge for farmers for the past 15 years.
* Therefore, *favorable* weather conditions would be *not* a problem for farmers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bokana ba kgapetla (Good soil):** While good soil is beneficial for agriculture, the text doesn't explicitly say it's *not* a problem for farmers. Water issues are highlighted as a bigger concern.
* **C: Bokima ba kgapetla (Good quality water):** The text explicitly states water quality has been a challenge.
* **D: Kgapetla e e gakologang (Good irrigation):**  The text doesn't directly address irrigation as a problem.  It focuses on water storage and quality.



"
"Mo godimo ga gore go nne le kgapetla, ke eng gape se se amang maiteko a go namola?","The correct answer is **B: Maemo a bosa a sa iketlang**.

The passage states: ""Mo godimo ga gore go nne le kgapetla, ke eng gape se se amang maiteko a go namola? **Maemo a bosa a sa iketlang a kgoreletsa maiteko a go falotsa.**""  This directly translates to: ""Besides having a flood, what else makes it difficult to drain? **Unstable ground makes it difficult to drain.**""



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go sa nne le ditlhokwa (Not having resources):** While lack of resources can be a problem, the passage specifically mentions unstable ground as a contributing factor to difficulty draining.
* **C: Go tlhoka thuso (Needing help):** The passage doesn't mention needing help.
* **D: Batshwari ba manyibi (Crocodiles):** Crocodiles are not mentioned in the passage.

Ke tumelo efe e Roberts a tilang go e tlhomamisa?,"The correct answer is **A: O dumela le tiriso ya go nna le tshwanelo ya gore dikgang tse di amang motho di nne sephiri sa gagwe.**

The passage explicitly states: ""O ne gape a tlhomamisa go re o dumelana le tiriso ya go nna le tshwanelo ya go re dikgang tse di amang motho di nne sephiri sa gagwe, selo se tshwetso ya ga Roe e tshegeditseng ka sone."" (He also affirmed that he agreed with the right of individuals to be sovereign over their own bodies, which Roe established.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Botlhokwa ba ditshwetso tse di tlhomameng tsa Kgotlatshekelokgolo:** While Roberts acknowledges the importance of judicial precedent, he's not primarily affirming its *importance* in this passage. He's affirming a principle *derived* from that precedent.
* **C: Tshimologo ya botshelo:** While the Roe v. Wade case touched on the issue of life, Roberts' affirmation isn't directly about the sanctity of life.
* **D: Tshiamelo ya sephiri:** While the passage mentions the right to be sovereign over one's body, calling it simply a ""tshiamelo ya sephiri"" (principle of sovereignty) doesn't fully capture the specific point Roberts is making about individual autonomy.



"
"Ke kgang efe e Roberts a neng a akanya gore e ka ga mekgwa e e sa siamang, mme go ka se tlotliwe ka yone?","The correct answer is **A: Go tlhomama ga ditshwetso tsa Kgotlatshekelokgolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Roberts ""gatelela polelo ya gagwe e a neng a intshitse go le pele ya go re Roe v. Wade e ne e le """"molao o o mo tirisong wa lefatshe"""" a gatelela botlhokwa jwa go tsamaelana ga ditshwetso tsa dikgetsi tse di tserweng ke kgotla ya makgaolakgang.""  This indicates he disagreed with the precedent set by Roe v. Wade and the importance of judicial decisions.  While the other options are related, they are consequences *of* his disagreement with the precedent. His core disagreement was with the importance and precedent of judicial decisions in general.



"
Ke kae mo marang a mabedi a lesedi a ageletsweng gore a lebe kwa loaping mo bosigong?,"The correct answer is **D: Mo gareng ga serapa sa segopotso**.

The passage states: ""Marang a mabedi a lesedi a ageletswe go re a lebe kwa loaping mo bosigong. Kago ya dikago tsa meago e kwa godimo di tsweletse kwa teng. Go tla nna le lefelo la dipalangwa le lefelo la go itlosa bodutu la segopotso mo gare."" This translates to: ""Two lights are switched on so that they can be seen in the distance. The roof of the train has ended. There will be a luggage area and a dual-purpose train toilet in between."" 

Therefore, the lights are located *between* the luggage area and the train toilet, which are parts of the train's undercarriage or frame (serapa sa segopotso).
"
"Go ya Ka temana, dikago tse dintha tse di goletseng kwa godimo di agiwa neng mo setsheng?","The correct answer is **D: Kago e tsweletse**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""Kago ya dikago tsa meago e kwa godimo di tsweletse kwa teng."" This translates to ""The scheduled time for the high-altitude military drills has ended.""  Therefore, the drills (and the lights used for them) happened *during* the scheduled time, which is stated to have ended.
"
Ke tshedimosetso efe e e bontshang gore The Seven Sisters ke magaga?,"The correct answer is **A: Dipharologano tsa mogote**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Pharologanyo ya ditshwantsho tsa mogote le botsididi tse di tserweng bosigo le motshegare e supa fa di ka tswa e le magaga.""  This translates to: ""The measurements of the shadows and dimensions taken at night and during the day suggest that they might be asteroids.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bophara ba matseno a legaga (Width of the asteroids):**  While the width is mentioned, it's not the primary evidence for them being asteroids. It's a characteristic of asteroids, but not unique to them.
* **C: Tshekatsheko ya Jioloji (Geological history):** The text doesn't focus on the geological history of the area.
* **D: Ditshwantsho tsa magaga mo Lefatsheng (Asteroid shapes on Earth):** The text compares their shape to other asteroids on Earth, but the *reason* for the comparison is the shadow and dimension measurements (shadows and dimensions) - which is given in option A.



"
"Go elwa tlhoko jang, tsibogelo ya Seven Sisters go bo mogote fa bo ntse bo fetoga?","The correct answer is **C: Bophara ba magaga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pharologanyo ya ditshwantsho tsa mogote le botsididi tse di tserweng bosigo le motshegare e supa fa di ka tswa e le magaga."" This translates to: ""The measurements of the light and shadow patterns taken at night and during the day suggest that they could be asteroids.""

Later, it mentions the width of the Seven Sisters: ""Dikgoro tsotlhe tsa legaga, tse di biditsweng leina la """"The Seven Sisters"""", di sekgele sa dimithara di ka nna 100 go ya go 250 (di-feet di le 328 go ya 820) ka bophara."" This translates to: ""All the asteroids, known as the ""Seven Sisters"", span from 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet) in width.""

Therefore, the passage directly connects the width (bophara) of the Seven Sisters to the possibility of them being asteroids. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mafoko afe ka mmelaelwa, a e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Lotso lwa gagwe le itsiwe ke balaodi (His identity was known to the browser)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Leina la gagwe le santse le sa itsiwe go bamolao, le fa gone ba itse go re ke leloko la setlhopha sa morafe wa Uighur."" This directly contradicts option C, which says his identity *was* known to the browser.

Let's look at why the other options are likely true based on the passage:

* **A: O dirisitse sejanaga ka nako ya tlhaselo (He used a VPN during the period of the incident):** The passage states he was caught *while* trying to download something. Using a VPN is a common method to mask one's location and activity during such actions.
* **B: Gatwe o thuntshitse sethuthupi (He was allegedly trying to download a file):** The passage says he was caught downloading something, which implies an attempt to download a file.
* **D: O ne a sa gobala (He was not paying attention):** The fact that he was caught suggests a lack of caution or awareness while conducting the download.

Therefore, the only statement definitively contradicted by the passage is that his identity was known to the browser."
Ke tshedimosetso efe tebang le tlhaselo e e tlhomamisitsweng ke balaodi?,"The correct answer is **D: Leina le sefane tsa mmelaelwa (The name is a clue to the ethnicity).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that while the suspect's name wasn't initially known, it *was* known that he belonged to the Uyghur ethnic group. 
* The fact that the name points to a specific ethnicity is a key piece of information that likely played a role in the investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Boitshupo ba mongwe le mongwe yo o thusitseng (The individual efforts of those who helped):** This is too general. While various people may have contributed to the investigation, the name itself is the specific clue mentioned.
* **B: Lotso lwa mmelaelwa (Ethnic prejudice):**  The text doesn't provide enough information to conclude that ethnic prejudice was a driving factor. While the ethnicity is relevant, the text focuses on the name as a specific clue.
* **C: Se se dirileng gore go nne le tlhaselo (What made it possible to have a clue):** This is also too broad. It doesn't directly address the *nature* of the clue.



Therefore, **D** best reflects the information presented in the text. The name is identified as a clue related to the suspect's ethnicity."
Ke ditlhopha dife tse di tla tshamekang mo motshamekong kwa Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Aforika Borwa le Australia**.

The passage states: ""Motshameko wa bofelo wa series o tla diragala ko lebaleng la metshameko la Ellis Park ko Johannesburg beke e e latelang, fa setlhopha sa Springbok se tla bo se tshameka le sa Australia."" (The decider match of the series will take place at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg next week, where the Springbok team will play against Australia.)
"
Di-Springbok di tla tshameka neng motshameko wa tsone o o latelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Motshameko wa bofelo wa di series o tla diragala ko lebaleng la metshameko la Ellis Park ko Johannesburg beke e e latelang, fa setlhopha sa Springbok se tla bo se tshameka le sa Australia."" (The decider match of the series will take place at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg next week, when the Springboks will play against Australia.)
"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang tse seteišene sa lefaufau se kgaratlhileng ka sone ka nako ya letsholo?,"The correct answer is **B: Go nna le gyroscope**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the aircraft were protected from thrusts by a ""sekgala se se sireletsegileng"" (protected shield).  The description of the shield's function in the question suggests it's something that helps maintain stability and orientation. A gyroscope is a device used for maintaining orientation, and it's a crucial component in aircraft for stability and control.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Tshola sekgala se se siameng go tswa kwa didirisweng tsa go laola tsibogo mo difofela loaping (A self-regulating shield from the flight control surfaces of the aircraft):** While shields might exist, this option doesn't directly address *what* protected the aircraft from the thrusts and how it maintained stability.
* **C: Go tlhosetsa jete (Releasing jets):** Releasing jets is a propulsion method, not a stabilization mechanism.
* **D: Go bona gape, boikutlo jo bo tlwaelegileng (Also, normal feeling):** This is too vague and doesn't describe a technical component.

Therefore, a gyroscope is the most logical answer as it relates directly to maintaining orientation and stability, which is what the passage implies the ""sekgala se se sireletsegileng"" did."
"Go ya ka temana, mokgele wa letsholo la seteišene sa lefaufau e ne e le eng?","The correct answer is **B: Go atamela enjene ya rokete e e dirisiwang go fetofetola lebelo la sefofane sa lefaufau**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Chiao and Sharipov were protected by a ""sekgala se se sireletsegileng go tswa go di-thruster tsa teng"" (a protective shell from the thrusters).  The phrase ""Taolo ya difofane e fa fatshe ya Russia e ile ya gologanya difofane mme seriti sa seteishene se ile sa bowa"" (The Russian ground control locked the spacecraft, and the station's axis tilted) implies a problem with the spacecraft's orientation and control. 

A gyroscope is essential for maintaining a spacecraft's orientation in space.  It's used to control attitude and stability. The passage mentions thrusters, which are used for maneuvering. Therefore, the station's axis tilting suggests a problem with the gyroscope or the system that uses it to control the spacecraft's orientation – essentially, the system that manages the rocket engine responsible for attitude control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go bona gyroscope e e timetseng** (To see a stationary gyroscope) - A stationary gyroscope wouldn't be useful for controlling a spacecraft.
* **C: Go konosetsa tsamao mo lefaufaung** (To monitor the trajectory in space) - While trajectory monitoring is important, the passage focuses on the *problem* with the spacecraft's *orientation*, not its trajectory.
* **D: Go tlhotlhetsa dijete** (To cook food) - This has absolutely nothing to do with the spacecraft's control systems.

"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, ka kgetse, a e seng nnete?","The incorrect statement is **D: AOL e ne e bonwa molato (AOL was considered a pioneer).**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that AOL *was* one of the leading internet service providers, and in fact, *pioneered* many online practices. The question implies this is incorrect.
*   Statements A, B, and C are all directly supported by the text: AOL was a leading ISP in Virginia, a law was created to reduce spam, and the law was implemented in 2003.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, a a tlhalosang kgetse ka nepagalo?","The correct answer is **B: Kgetse e ne e ama batlamedi ba babedi, ba ba itlhomileng kwa pele ba ditirelo tsa inthanete.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ke kgetse e ne ya sekwa kwa Virginia ka go re ke legae la batlamedi ba mafaratlhatlha a inthanete ba maemo a a kwa pele e leng AOL..."" This directly translates to ""It was a lawsuit against users of online services who were leading users of internet services, namely AOL..."" This indicates the lawsuit was *against* users, not about AOL itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL e bonwe molato wa phasalatso ntle le tetlelelo:** While AOL was a target of spam, the passage doesn't say they were found liable for failing to take action.
* **C: Kgetse e ne ya sekiwa ka 2003:** The passage mentions the law was enacted in 2003, not that the lawsuit *occurred* in 2003.
* **D: AOL e simolotse tsheko ya kgetse:** The passage says AOL was *a user* of the online services, not the one who initiated the lawsuit.



"
"Go ya ka temana, Vidal o ne a simolola go tshamekela setlhopha sefe dipaka di le tharo tse di fetileng?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The question asks where Vidal played for the three previous seasons before joining Barcelona (Barça). The text states: ""Vidal yo o ne a ikgolaganya le setlhopha sa Barca a tswa kwa setlhopheng sa Sevilla, paka tse tharo tse di fetileng."" which translates to ""Vidal was contracted to Barca coming from the Sevilla team, for the previous three.""
"
Vidal o tshameketse Barça metshameko e le mekae?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The question states: ""Fa a sale a fudugela kwa moshateng wa ma-Catalan, Vidal o tshameketse setlhopha se makgetho a le 49."" which translates to ""After joining the Catalan team, Vidal played 49 matches.""
"
Ke bomang ba e leng setlhopha se se emang kgatlhanong mo motshamekong?,"The correct answer is **A: Jarque**.

The passage states: ""Jarques o ne a ikatisa ka nako ya ikatiso kwa Coverciano kwa Italy mo mesong..."" which translates to ""Jarques was training during the training session at Coverciano in Italy..."" and later ""...o ne a dula mo hoteleng ya maloko a setlhopha pele ga motshameko o o rulaganyeditsweng go tshamekiwa ka la Tshipi kgatlhanong le Bolonia."" which translates to ""...he was staying at the team hotel before the match scheduled for the match on Thursday against Bologna.""

Therefore, Jarques is the one training and staying at the hotel related to the upcoming match.
"
Goreng Jarque a ne a nna mo hoteleng?,"The correct answer is **A: O ne a ikatisa** (He was training).

The text explicitly states: ""Jarques o ne a ikatisa ka nako ya ikatiso kwa Coverciano kwa Italy..."" which translates to ""Jarques was training during training time in Coverciano, Italy...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O ne a na le kopano ya pele ga paka** (He had a pre-match meeting): The text says he was at the team hotel *before* the match, but it doesn't say he had a meeting.
* **C: O ne a tshameka ka Sontaga** (He was playing on Sunday): The text mentions a match *scheduled* for Sunday, but it doesn't confirm he was playing on that day.
* **D: O ne a ikatisa le Bolonia** (He was training with Bologna): The text mentions he was training *before* a scheduled match *against* Bologna, not *with* them.



"
Goreng setlamo sa thutafatshe sa Jakarta se ne se sa batle go ntsha tsiboso?,"The correct answer is **A: Go ne go se na matshosetsi a tsunami**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that even though the earthquake was strong (6.5 magnitude), there was *no tsunami warning* because the earthquake didn't reach the critical depth of 6.5.
* The fact that people started evacuating on their own *after* the earthquake happened indicates a lack of official warning.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **B: Go tila ketsaetsego magareng ga baagi (People starting to evacuate):**  While people evacuated, this doesn't explain why a warning wasn't issued.
    * **C: Go tila go amega ga kgwebo ya selegae (Disruption of the local economy):** Economic disruption doesn't prevent a tsunami warning.
    * **D: E ne e sa fitlhelele bogolo bo bo lekaneng go nna thoromo ya lefatshe (It didn't reach a large enough magnitude to be a significant earthquake):** The passage states it *was* a 6.5 magnitude earthquake, which is significant. The key issue was the depth.



Therefore, the absence of a tsunami warning was directly linked to the earthquake's depth, not its magnitude.



"
"Go ya ka temana, thoromo ya lefatshe e bakile eng?","The correct answer is **D: 6.5 mo selekanyong sa bogolo ba thoromo ya lefatshe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""go ya ka ba tepoloapi ba Jakarta, ga go na go ntshiwa tlhagiso ka tsunami lebaka e le go re thoromo ga e ya fitlha mo selekanong se se tlhokegang sa **6.5**."" This directly indicates that the earthquake's magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale was the reason for the lack of a tsunami warning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baagi ba selegae ba ba tshogileng:** While the people were concerned, this isn't *what the earthquake caused*. It's a reaction to the situation.
*   **B: Matshosetsi a tsunami:** The passage states there were *no* tsunami alerts.
*   **C: Tsiboso e e ntshitsweng:** The passage doesn't mention an earthquake causing a landslide.



"
Ke efe ya tseno e e tlhotlheletsang tiro ya Letsatsi le dinaledi tse dingwe tsotlhe?,"The correct answer is **A: Kelelo ya lesedi le polasema** (The combination of light and plasma).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tiro ya dinaledi tsotlhe mo loaping go lemogilwe go re e dirwa ke ka fa di ntshang lesedi ka teng le go dikologa fela.""  This translates to ""The operation of all stars in the universe has been shown to be due to them emitting light and only splitting."" The passage then elaborates that the combination of light and splitting is key to understanding Rossby waves.

Therefore, option A directly reflects the information provided in the passage.  The other options include elements that are either not central to the passage's main point or are presented as secondary factors.
"
Nomoro ya Rossby ya naledi e tlhomamisiwa jang?,"The correct answer is **B: Bokana ba kelo ya polasema (The gradient of the magnetic field)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiro ya dinaledi tsotlhe mo loaping go lemogilwe go re e dirwa ke ka fa di ntshang lesedi ka teng le go dikologa fela.  **Go phatsima le go dikologa di dirisiwa mmogo thata go bona palo ya naledi ya Rossby, e e tsamaelanang le go elela ga polasema.**""  This translates to: ""All the activity in the atmosphere is shown to be caused by the fact that they emit light and are only separated. **The intensity and separation are combined to see the Rossby wave number, which is related to the arrangement of the magnetic field.**""

Therefore, the Rossby wave number is determined by the *gradient* or change in the magnetic field.  Option B directly reflects this.
"
Ke peresente efe ya batho ba ba neng ba botsolodiwa e e reng Australia e nne rephaboliki ka bonako?,"The correct answer is **A: Diperesente di le 31**.

The question asks about the percentage of people who wanted Australia to become a republic *no time soon*. The passage states: ""29% ya bone ba dumela go re Australia e tshwanetse go nna rephaboliki mo nakong e e sa fediseng pelo, fa ba ba dirang 31% ba dumela go re e seke ya nna rephaboliki, gotlhelele."" (29% of them agreed that Australia should become a republic at some point in the future, while 31% agreed that it should not become a republic, ever.)
"
"Go ya ka Julie Gillard, Australia e tshwanetse e nne rephaboliki neng?","The correct answer is **B: Morago ga puso ya Kgosigadi Elizabeth II**.

The text states: ""Tonakgolo wa nama-o-sa-tshwere, Julia Gillard o buile ka ipapatso ya ditlhopo tsa puso-kgolo tsa 2010 go re o dumela go re Australia e tshwanetse e nne puso ya rephaboliki fa paka ya ga Mmamosadinyana (Elizabeth II) e wela.""

This directly indicates that Julia Gillard believed Australia should become a republic *after* the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.



"
Ke mokgatlho ofe o o leng ka fa tlase ga diotso-patlisiso tsa molao?,"The correct answer is **D: Komitipotlana ya Bookamedi le Dipatlisiso**.

The text states: ""...ka fa tlase ga House Energy and Commerce Committee.""  ""House Energy and Commerce Committee"" is the English translation of Komitipotlana ya Bookamedi le Dipatlisiso.
"
Cliff Stearns ke tlhogo ya komiti efe?,"The correct answer is **D: Komitipotlana ya Bookamedi le Dipatlisiso**.

The text states: ""...ja fa Planned Parenthood e dirisang madi le dipego tsa yone ka teng go ya patlisiso e e dirwang ke Moemedi Cliff Stearns, o o ka fa tlase ga **House Energy and Commerce Committee**.""  The phrase ""House Energy and Commerce Committee"" is equivalent to ""Komitipotlana ya Bookamedi le Dipatlisiso"" in Setswana.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng seo se sa diragalelang mosadi wa kwa Switzerland?","The correct answer is **D: Mogala wa gagwe le lepothopo di ne tsa utswiwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Re tshwere batho bale batlhano ba ba beteletseng mme wa mo-Swiss, e bile re ne ra bona mogala wa lethatheka le lepothopo tsa gagwe"" which translates to ""We arrested five people who were involved and we also saw the trunk and belongings of the Swiss man."" This directly indicates that the Swiss man's trunk and belongings were found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dithoto tsa gagwe tse di utswitsweng, di bonwe.** (His clothes were found) - While it's implied belongings were found, the passage specifically mentions the trunk and belongings, not just clothes.
* **B: O bolailwe** (He was killed) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the Swiss man being killed.
* **C: O ne a sotliwa ka thobalano ke batho ba ba 5** (He was kidnapped by 5 people) - The passage says 5 people were *arrested* for involvement, not that the Swiss man was kidnapped.

The text explicitly states: ""ASUS Eee PC, e pele e anamisitsweng lefatshe ka bophara ka ntata ya bokgoni ja yone ja go fokotsa ditshenyegelo tsa madi, ga mmogo le ditiro tse e kgonang go di dira, e nnile kgang ya moruthutha ko Taipei IT Month ka 2007."" This translates to: ""ASUS Eee PC, being widely promoted for its ability to reduce energy consumption, along with its capabilities, became the star of Taipei IT Month in 2007.""

Netbooks are known for their small size and focus on low energy consumption, making ""mogala wa letheka"" (netbook) the most accurate description.
"
Ke mang a neng a rwele maikarabelo a ditokomane tse di latlhegileng tsa poso?,"The correct answer is **A: Badiri ba poso (Postal workers)**.

The passage states that the postal workers wrote a letter requesting clarification from the agents and the post office after one person had 600 undelivered documents, including 429 from the New Year. Therefore, the postal workers were the ones dealing with the overflowing mail.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang a kopileng boitshwarelo tebang le ditokomane tse di timetseng?","The correct answer is **C: Bobegadikgang (Postmasters)**.

The text states: ""Maabane, ba poso ba ntshitse lekwalo la go kopa maitshwarelo mo baageding le mo mmedieng morago ga go re..."" which translates to ""Therefore, the postmasters wrote a letter requesting clarification from the agents and the mediator after..."" 

This clearly indicates that the postmasters (ba poso) were the ones who requested the clarification and submitted the documents.
"
Del Potro o ne a tlhoka go mekamekana le kgang ya gagwe ya legetla neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo seteng ya bobedi**.

The text states: ""Del Potro o ne a na le ketelo pele mo legatong la bobedi..."" which translates to ""Del Potro had a lead in the second set...""  and ""...mme se gape se tlhokane le go kgaoganya dinno morago ga go fitlhelela 6-6."" (""...and it also led to a tiebreaker after reaching 6-6"").  The phrase ""morago ga go fitlhelela 6-6"" refers to the second set. Therefore, Del Potro needed to find his focus in the second set.
"
Dipoelo tsa kgaisano ya ntlha ya go tlhomamisa mofenyi?,"The correct answer is **D: E ne ya fenngwa ke Del Potro mo seteng ya bobedi.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Del Potro o ne a na le ketelo pele mo legatong la bobedi, mme se gape se tlhokane le go kgaoganya dinno morago ga go fitlhelela 6-6.""  This translates to: ""Del Potro had a lead in the second set, and it also led to a tiebreak after reaching 6-6.""  This means Del Potro won the second set tiebreak.

Therefore, option D is the accurate reflection of the information given in the passage.
"
"Jaaka go tlhalositswe mo temaneng,ke mang,segolobogolo, yo o neng a amana le molwetse ?","The correct answer is **B: Bana**.

The text states: ""Gape molaodi o ne a re, ”Gompieno, re ithutile gore **bana bangwe ba ba leng mo dingwageng tsa go tsena sekolo ba supilwe e le ba ba kopaneng le molwetse**”."" which translates to ""And the teacher said, ""Today we learned that **some other children who are in the school age group have been trained to be with the sick**.""""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke netefaletso efe e mmusi a sa e dirang fa a ne a bua le banni ba kwa Texas?","The correct answer is **D: Kgetse ga e masisi**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Perry o tlhamaletse hela a re, """"go na le mafelo a le mmalwa mo lefatsheng a a tla kgonang go emelana le dikgwetlho tsa kgetse e."""" Gape molaodi o ne a re, ”Gompieno, re ithutile gore bana bangwe ba ba leng mo dingwageng tsa go tsena sekolo ba supilwe e le ba ba kopaneng le molwetse”. O ne a tswelela a re, """"kgetse e e masisi.

This clearly indicates that the speaker (presumably Perry) believes the measles are not serious (""kgetse e e masisi"").  The other options are either not directly supported by the text or are less accurate reflections of the main point.
"
"Ke motswedi ofe wa kakgelo ya metlae, e e neng ya tlhangwa ke baithuti ba pele ba UW, ba le babedi?","The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

* It also describes The Onion's rise to prominence and its impact on other satirical programs.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pegelo ya Colbert** - This refers to Stephen Colbert, not the satirical publication.
* **B: batlhophi ba moporesidente le mothusi wa gagwe** - This refers to the President and Vice President, and has no connection to the question.
* **C: Daily Show** - While the Daily Show is mentioned, the passage focuses on The Onion as the origin and inspiration for many satirical programs. The Daily Show is a product *influenced* by The Onion, but not the originator of the satirical concept.

"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tseno, e e sa akarediwang mo teng ga kgwebo e kgolo ya kakgelo ya metlae ya The Onion?","The correct answer is **C: Webosaete**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that The Onion has a ""kgatiso-kwalo, tsebe ya inthanete e e nnileng le kgogedi ya batho bale 5,000,000 ka kgwedi ya Diphalane..."" (a strong online presence with a weekly readership of 5,000,000...).  This indicates the *website* is a core element of their success.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pontsho ya mmapa wa lefatshe (World map show):** The passage doesn't mention a world map show as a component of The Onion's success.
* **B: Filimi (Film):** While The Onion has released a book (""Our Dumb Word""), the passage doesn't state they've released any films.
* **D: Kgatiso e e gatisitsweng (Published book):** The passage *does* mention they've published a book (""Our Dumb Word""), so this isn't the answer.



Therefore, the only option that *isn't* explicitly mentioned as part of The Onion's successful online presence is a world map show, and the closest option reflecting that is the *website*.  Since the question asks which is *not* part of their success, and the website is a key part, the best answer is the remaining option. However, since the question is looking for what is *not* specifically mentioned, and option C isn't explicitly mentioned as a component, then it is the right answer.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se neng se letetswe ke mapodise?","The correct answer is **C: Matseno a Downing Street**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Moragonyana fela ga nako ya lesome le bongwe, bangongoregii ba ile ba thibela dikoloi mo tseleng e e lebileng bokone kwa Whitehall."" This translates to ""Shortly after 11:15, agents blocked cars on the road heading north in Whitehall."" 

Whitehall is where Downing Street is located. Therefore, the road being blocked is heading towards Downing Street. The passage further mentions the meeting was at the ""legaeng la semmuso la Tonakgolo"" (official residence of the Prime Minister), which is Downing Street. 

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, the road blockage directly affected access to Downing Street.
"
Mapodise a ne a kopa badiraditshupetso ka nako mang gore ba sute go tila go oketsega ga pharakano go ya pele?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka 11:20**.

The text states: ""Ka nako ya 11:20, mapodise a ne a kopa babopeledi go sutela fa godimo ga bodilo jwa letlhakore la tsela..."" which translates to ""At 11:20, the police asked pedestrians to move above the normal level of the road...""
"
Ke eng se e leng nnete ka dipatlisiso tse di dirilweng ke Dr. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **A: Dipholo di ka nna mosola go balwetse ba bolwetse ba sukiri ba Type 1 bo neng bo ntse bo le teng.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Dr. Ehud Ur... o tsibositse go re dipatlisiso tse di sentse e le gone di simolodisiwang...o na le dipelaelo tsa go re a bolwetse jwa sukiri bo a alafega, go sa lebalwe go re diphitlhelelo tseno ga di amane ka gope le batho ba ba nang le sukiri ya Type 1.""  This directly indicates that the research suggests hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) *could* be a sign of undiagnosed Type 1 diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dipeba tse dingwe tse di neng di na le bolwetse ba sukiri ga di sa na bona:**  The passage says the *opposite* is true – the research is questioning if hypoglycemia *could* be a sign of undiagnosed diabetes.
* **C: O na le tsholofelo ya gore diphitlhelelo di ka tlisa kalafi:** While hypoglycemia *can* be a health concern, the passage doesn't focus on the dangers of hypoglycemia itself. It's about its potential link to *undiagnosed* diabetes.
* **D: Dipeba dingwe tse di neng di se nang bolwetse jwa sukiri, jaanong di na le bone:** This is the opposite of what the research is suggesting. The research is about those who *already have* diabetes.



"
"Go ya ka temana, Dr Ur o belaela ka eng?","The correct answer is **A: Fa diphitlhelelo di le maleba go batho ba ba nang le bolwetse jwa sukiri jwa Type 1.**

The passage explicitly states that Dr. Ur is skeptical of the recent findings because they don't align with what's observed in people with Type 1 diabetes. He believes the findings might be flawed.
"
"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, a a sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo,thubagano ya Flight CG4684?","The correct answer is **A: Kwa ntlheng, sefofane se ne se sa kgone go kotama ka ntlha ya maemo a bosa.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Patlo e ile ya kgorelediwa ke seemo se se tshwanang se se sa siamang sa bosa se se bakileng go re sefofane se tlogele go kotama."" (The crash was caused by a malfunctioning part due to icing, which caused the plane to crash.)
* Option A directly reflects this cause: ""Kwa ntlheng, sefofane se ne se sa kgone go kotama ka ntlha ya maemo a bosa"" (Essentially, the plane couldn't take off due to icing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sefofane se ne sa thubagana mo lefelong le le kgakalakgakala** (The plane crashed at a critical altitude): While the crash was critical, the passage doesn't specify *where* it crashed in terms of altitude.
* **C: Sefofane se lekile go kotama gararo pele se thubagana** (The plane tried to take off twice before crashing):  The passage doesn't mention multiple takeoff attempts.
* **D: Go batla lefelo le sefofane se thubegetseng teng, go amilwe ke maemo a bosa** (The location and the plane being delayed were due to icing): While icing caused the delay, the passage doesn't connect the location or a delay directly to the icing.  It focuses on the *cause* of the crash.



"
Ke eng se se bakileng gore Flight CG4684 e emise go kotama?,"The correct answer is **D: Maemo a bosa a ne a le bokoa**.

The text states: ""Patlo e ile ya kgorelediwa ke seemo se se tshwanang se se sa siamang sa bosa se se bakileng go re sefofane se tlogele go kotama."" This translates to ""The crash was caused by a faulty part of the landing gear which caused the plane to crash."" Therefore, the faulty landing gear (a part of the aircraft's structure) being faulty caused the failure to land.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke afe a mafoko a a latelang ka se se diragaletseng Franciszek Kowal a e leng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: O kgonne go thuba letlhabaphefo** (He could have been lucky).

Here's why:

* The text states that the glass in the barn *did* break, and people started taking the sheep out. 
*  It specifically mentions Franciszek Kowal as *one* of the shepherds who went out with the sheep.
* The text emphasizes the unusual nature of the glass breaking when the sheep were trying to escape. This implies that Kowal's being there at that specific moment was a matter of chance or luck.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mo bofelong, o ne a sa gobala** (In the barn, he didn't sleep): The text doesn't say anything about Kowal sleeping in the barn.
* **C: O robile setulo fa a ne a leka go tswa** (He fell down when he tried to get up): The text doesn't mention Kowal falling.
* **D: O ne a gobale fa a leka go thuba letlhabaphefo** (He was injured when he tried to be lucky):  The text doesn't say Kowal was injured.  It frames his presence at the moment as fortunate, not related to an injury.



"
Goreng go le thata go lekanya ditlamorago tse di ka nnang teng tsa Letsubutsubu la Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Letsubutsubu le kgakala le lefatshe le le fetang kwa godimo ga lone.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ga go bonolo go ka sekaseka go re ditlamorago tsa sone di tla nna jang mo lefatsheng la Amerika kgotsa kwa Caribbean."" This directly points to the difficulty in predicting the storm's path and intensity.  The reason for this difficulty is that hurricanes are complex systems influenced by many factors, including the temperature of the water they are moving over and the atmospheric conditions above them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Goreng go le thata go lekanya ditlamorago tse di ka nnang teng tsa Letsubutsubu la Danielle:** This is a restatement of the question, not an explanation of *why* it's hard.
* **B: Borasaense ga ba na bonnete ka diphefo tse di maatla tsa letsubutsubu:** While scientists can't be 100% certain, they do have models and data that allow them to make informed predictions. The passage focuses more on the path prediction difficulty.
* **D: Letsubutsubu le kgakala thata le Miami:** The passage mentions Miami as a potential area of impact but doesn't explain the difficulty in predicting the storm's overall path and consequences.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, a e seng nnete, ka Letsubutsubu la Danielle?","The incorrect statement, according to the text, is **A: Khuetso ya yone go Caribbean ga e itsiwe (Its path to the Caribbean is unknown).**

The text explicitly states: "" Baitseanape ko National Hurricane Center, ba buwa go re e tlaare go ise go fete Laboraro, sefefo sa Danielle, se tla oketsa maatla go nna setsuatsue."" (Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center say that before Labor Day, storm Danielle is expected to intensify into a hurricane.)  And it further states ""...ga go bonolo go ka sekaseka go re ditlamorago tsa sone di tla nna jang mo lefatsheng la Amerika kgotsa kwa Caribbean."" (...it is difficult to predict where its remnants will go in America or the Caribbean.)

This implies that its path *to* the Caribbean is uncertain, not unknown.  The other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: E tlholegile kwa lewatleng la Atlantic (It is located in the Atlantic Ocean):** The text states it has formed in the Atlantic Ocean.
*   **C: Le ka fetoga go nna kgwanyape (It can become a major hurricane):** The text mentions that it is expected to intensify into a hurricane and become a major hurricane.
*   **D: Le gaufi le lefatshe le le fetang fa godimo ga lone (It is far from land):** The text mentions that predicting the impact on land in America or the Caribbean is difficult, implying it is currently far from land.

"Go ya ka temana, go tshitshinngwa gore go diragale eng ka bolwetse pele bo baka leroborobo la lefatshe lotlhe?","The correct answer is **A: E tshwanetse e nne e e seng kotsi thata**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the H5N1 virus in Turkey is concerning because it *might* be a precursor to a global pandemic. The fact that people are infected *without* showing symptoms suggests the virus might be evolving to be less severe initially. If it were already causing severe symptoms, the risk of a pandemic would be higher. The passage implies a concern that the virus could be spreading asymptomatically before becoming symptomatic. Therefore, the initial stage is likely less dangerous, but the potential for future severity is what's worrying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Matshwao a tshwanetse a nne a ntse a se bogale thata:** This is the opposite of what the passage implies. The concern is that people are infected *without* symptoms, suggesting mild initial illness.
*   **C: Batho ba bantsi ba tlhoka go tshwaetsega:** While precautions are always wise, the passage doesn't specifically state that many people need to quarantine. The concern is about the virus's potential to evolve.
*   **D: Bana ba tshwanetse go nna le matshwao:** The passage explicitly mentions that children are being infected *without* symptoms.



"
"Go ya ka temana, letsubutsubu le ne le le bokgakala jo bo kana kang go tswa kwa Fujian?","The correct answer is **D: Dikhilomitara di le 77**

The passage states: ""Go tloga mo bosigong jwa Phatwe 9, leitlho la Morakot le ne le ka nna bokgakala jwa dikhilomithara di le masome-a-supa go tswa porofenseng ya China ya Fuijan.""  This translates to: ""From the starting point of Path 9, the meteor shower could be seen to be a distance of over seventy kilometers from the Fujian province of China.""
"
Ke mang yo a neng a dumedisa George W. Bush fa a goroga kwa Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng le Lee Hsien Loong**.

The text states: ""O ne a dumedisiwa ke mothusa Tonakgolo wa Singapore e leng Wong Kan Seng a bo a buisana le Tonakgolo ya Singapore e leng Lee Hsien Loong..."" which translates to ""He was greeted by the Chief of Staff of Singapore, Wong Kan Seng, who then spoke with the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong...""
"
Moporesidente o buile neng ka katoloso ya kgwebisano ya Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa morago ga go latlhegelwa ke ditlhopho tsa paka ya magareng.**

The text states: ""Morago ga go ya go latlhegelwa ke ditlhopho, Bush o ile a bolelela babogedi ka katoloso ya papadisanyo kwa Asia."" This directly indicates that he spoke about the Asian economic crisis *after* the meeting with the business leaders.

"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e leng mokgele wa konokono wa puso?","The correct answer is **A: Ka Mopitlwe wa ngwaga ono, o bo o tlametse ka matlole, dikoloi tse dintsi tsa dipitse.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the *goal* of the government.** The text states the goal is to reduce traffic congestion.
* **Option A directly reflects that goal.**  It says the goal is to secure (presumably, acquire or increase) a large number of buses (dikoloi tse dintsi tsa dipitse) during the year to reduce congestion.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:**  ""Nna le dikoloi tsa dipitse di le 300"" (Having 300 buses) is just a number and doesn't represent the overall goal.
    * **C:** ""Nna le dikoloi tsa dipitse tse dingwe di le 1,300"" (Having other buses of 1,300) is also just a number and doesn't express the objective.
    * **D:** ""Fokotsa lesukasuke mo dikoloing tsa dipitse"" (Reduce traffic congestion in buses) is a *result* of the goal, not the goal itself.  It describes what will happen if the goal is achieved.



Therefore, option A best represents the government's aim to address traffic congestion by increasing the number of buses."
Puso e itsisitse eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba rulaganya go tlamela ka matlole, dikoloi tse dingwe gape tsa dipitse di le 300**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""To fill 300 more will bring the total number of cars to 1300, which will be used to reduce congestion.""
* **This means:** The government is acquiring 300 more buses (or vehicles) to reach a total of 1300, with the goal of reducing traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba ikanetse go imolola bothata jwa dikoloi tsa dipitse:** This is too general. While they are trying to address the problem, it doesn't describe the specific action.
* **C: Ba rulaganya go tlamela ka matlole, dikoloi tse dingwe tsa dipitse di le 1,300:**  This is incorrect because they are *adding* to the existing fleet, not just having 1300 total. The 1300 is a *result* of adding 300.
* **D: Bothata ba lesukasuke bo tla bo rarabolotswe ka Mopitlwe:** This is incorrect because the action is happening *now* (or very soon) with the acquisition of the buses.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke tshedimosetso efe e e itsiweng?","The correct answer is **A: Selekanyo sa matshosetsi se fokotsegile (The number of protesters has decreased)**.

Here's why:

The statement ""O ne a re, """"ga gona botlhale jwa go re go ya go nna le tlhaselo mo bogautshwaneng. Le fa go ntse jalo, phokotsego ya matshosetsi go nna selekanyo se se tseneletseng ga go reye go re matshosetsi otlhe a tsamaile."""""" translates to: ""He said, 'There is no reason for us to go and have a protest in the town. Even so, the decrease in protesters has reached a level where not all protesters have gone.'""

The key phrase is ""phokotsego ya matshosetsi go nna selekanyo se se tseneletseng"" which means ""the decrease in protesters has reached a certain level"".  This indicates the number of protesters has decreased.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ga go sa na matshosetsi ape (There are no protesters):** The statement explicitly says protesters *have* decreased, not disappeared entirely.
* **C: Tlhaselo e lebeletswe (A protest is expected):**  The statement explicitly states the speaker doesn't think a protest is necessary.
* **D: Ba tsa Matlhale ba tlhomamisitse gore tlhaselo e tsile go nna masisi (The elders have agreed that the protest has become a woman):** This option is nonsensical and not supported by the text.



"
"Ke polelo efe tebang le ditshupetso, e e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Khomišine ya moporesidente e ne e le tsibogo go ditshupetso**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ke CEP ya botlhano ya ga Martelly mo dingwageng di le nne. Kgwedi e e fetileng komishene ya boporesidente e ne ya atlanegisa go re di-CEP di role tiro pele e le karolo ya ditlamelwana tsa ditsela tse di tla dirang go re naga e ye kwa ditlhophong tse disha. **Komishene ya boporesidente e ne e le tsibogo ya ga Martelly ya megwanto e e anameng kgatlhanong le go lwantsha mmuso e simolotseng ka Diphalane.**""

This clearly indicates the President's commission was a loyalist commission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ditlhopho tse di diegileng, di tsositse ditshupetso:** While the text mentions the alleged kidnapping of groups, it doesn't state that these groups orchestrated the incidents themselves.
*   **C: Ditshupetso di ne di batla gore CEP wa pele a role tiro:** The text says the commission *asked* the CEP to prepare work, but it doesn't say the incidents *wanted* the previous CEP to do so.
*   **D: Ditshupetso di ne di na le tirisodikgoka ka dinako dingwe:** The text says that in the past, the incidents were palled by the kidnapping of groups, but not that the incidents themselves had a history of being suspicious.

Therefore, the only false statement is that the President's commission was a loyalist commission."
Ke mang a tshitshintseng gore CEP ya bofelo e role tiro?,"The correct answer is **A: Martelly**.

The text explicitly states: ""P: Martelly o letse a ikanisitse khuduthamaga e ncha ya Provincial Electoral Council (CEP), ya maloko a le marobongwe, maabane. Ke CEP ya botlhano ya ga Martelly mo dingwageng di le nne."" This translates to: ""Q: Martelly has appointed a new leadership for the Provincial Electoral Council (CEP), composed of independent members, recently. This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years."" This clearly indicates that Martelly is the one who appointed the new leadership and therefore made the CEP role work.
"
"Go ya ka temana,Ke eng seo lekgotla la USA Gymnastics le sa dumalaneng le sone, morago ga gore Nassar a kgokgontshe batshameki?","The correct answer is **D: Dipatlisiso tse di ikemetseng (Independent investigations)**.

The text states: ""Ba sethopha sa USA Gymnastics ba rotloetsa go re go nne le patlisiso e e ikemetseng..."". This means they are advocating *for* independent investigations, implying they haven't fully embraced or agreed to them yet. The text also mentions their agreement with the USOC on needing independent investigations to uncover the depth of the Larry Nassar abuse scandal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go tlosa leina le o bidiwang ka lone semmuso (Removing the name itself officially)** - The text doesn't mention any disagreement about officially removing a name.
* **B: Go tlhola maemo a a maatlafaditsweng (Strengthening positions)** -  The text doesn't imply disagreement about strengthening positions.
* **C: Diphetogo tse di tlhokegang mo teng ga lekoko (Necessary changes within the organization)** - While they agree that necessary changes are needed, the question asks what they *disagree* with regarding Nassar. They are advocating *for* changes, not disagreeing with the need for them.



"
"Go ya ka polelo,ke eng maikaelelomagolo a USA Gymnastics gammogo le Komiti ya Di-Olimpiki ya Amerika go ya pele?","The correct answer is **D: Go tsweletsa tikologo e e sireletsegileng ya batshameki.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC ""agree on the importance of fostering a safe environment for all athletes connected to the Olympics.""  All the other options are *aspects* of achieving that goal, but the overarching, agreed-upon objective is a safe environment.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate as the primary agreement:

* **A: Leba ka kelotlhoko, go sotla ga Larry Nassar** - While the Nassar scandal is a major driver of the agreement, it's the *reason* for wanting a safe environment, not the agreement itself.
* **B: Go tsaya setefikeiti** -  Issuing certificates is a *method* to achieve a safer environment, but not the core agreement.
* **C: Go latelela dipatlisiso tsa sephiri** - Independent investigations are a *means* to understand what happened and implement changes, ultimately contributing to a safer environment.

Therefore, the most accurate and encompassing answer is **D**.



"
Sekepe se ne se ya kae fa tiragalo e diragala? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text states: ""Sekepe sa teng se ne se le mo tseleng go ya **Puerto Princesa ko Palawan**."" which translates to ""The ship was on its way to **Puerto Princesa in Palawan**.""
"
Ke eng se e seng boammaaruri tebang le sekepe se se umakilweng mo temaneng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ke sekepe sa moepo sa go thibela bothata bo bo ka tlhagang.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the ship is a ""sekepe sa mofuta wa Avenger sa tshwantsho dibomo te di epetsweng"" (Avenger-class escort ship). Escort ships were designed for protection and to prevent attacks.  Options A and B refer to a location, not the ship's purpose. Option D is true, but it doesn't explain what kind of ship it is.

Therefore, option C accurately describes the function of an Avenger-class escort ship.
"
Ke mang a neng a neelana ka polelo tebang le masole a ntwa a US?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage explicitly states that Donald Trump, the President of the United States, told the US military that they would be leaving Syria.
"
"Go ya ka polelo, ke naga efe e e rweleng maikarabelo a go disa batlhabani ba ba tshwerweng?","The correct answer is **A: Syria**.

"
Ke eng se go dumelwang gore se bakile kgosomano?,"The correct answer is **B: Molelo o o sa laolegeng (Uncontrollable winds)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Thulano e diragetse kwa godimo mo dithabeng, go dumelwa go re e bakilwe ke molelo o o bogale."" which translates to ""A tornado struck above the mountains, it was agreed that it was caused by uncontrollable winds.""
"
Kgosomano e diragetse mo karolong ya mofuta ofe?,"The correct answer is **D: Le le dithaba (Mountains)**.

The passage states: ""Thulano e diragetse kwa godimo mo dithabeng..."" which translates to ""A landslide occurred high in the mountains...""
"
Batlhankedi ba ne ba solofela eng ka ntlha ya morwalela?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsosoloswa ga dithotobolo tsa motlhaba (The recovery of the river's population)**.

The passage states: ""...badiredi ba solofela go re a tla bo a lekane go tsosolosa moshawa o o gogotsweng kwa tlasenyana."" which translates to ""...the officials promised that the population will be able to recover and thrive in the future.""  This refers to the recovery of the river's population, specifically the endangered river chub.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tlholwa ga lewatle (The flourishing of the ocean):** The passage focuses on a river ecosystem, not the ocean.
* **C: Palo e e oketsegileng ya dihumpback chub (A stable population of humpback chub):** While the passage mentions humpback chub, it states that they were dwindling and one species disappeared. The promise is for the recovery of the river's ecosystem, which *includes* the chub, but isn't solely about their numbers.
* **D: Diphologolo tse dintsi tsa naga (Many fish species):** The passage discusses the decline of several species, not a general increase in fish populations.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, tse di amilweng ke kago ya letamo, go ya go ile?","The correct answer is **A: Dithotobolo tsa motlhaba (Habitat restoration)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go itsheka mo gone gole botlhokwa go dira di thothobolo tsa motlhaba, mo go thusitse go jewa ke diphologolo tsa naga."" This translates to ""It is important to do habitat restoration, which has helped the fish to survive."" 

Therefore, habitat restoration was a crucial action taken after the dam was built. The other options are consequences or outcomes of the dam and restoration, not the initial action taken to address the problem.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang a fileng Dinaga tse di Kopaneng, tshedimosetso ka tlhaselo e e ka nnang gone?","The correct answer is **C: Motswedi o o sa utololwang (Unidentified source)**.

"
"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e tlhalosang ka nepagalo,se go tweng ke leano la tlhaselo la bafeteletsa dilo?","The correct answer is **C: Phatlakanya dibomo kwa mafelong a konokono mo dinageng di le pedi.**

Here's why:

* The text states the U.S. is concerned about the use of human smugglers to facilitate the movement of ""methamphetamine"" (mafelo a konokono) *through* Kenya and Ethiopia.
* This implies the smuggling operation involves crossing *between* the two countries.

Therefore, the most accurate description of the U.S.'s concern (and the likely scope of their investigation) is the movement of people across *both* Kenya and Ethiopia to facilitate the drug trafficking.
"
Ke ofe wa batho ba ba latelang yo e seng mmueledi?,"The correct answer is **B: Sakis Kechagioglou**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are **both** journalists.
* Petros Mantouvalos and Makis Triantafylopoulos are also mentioned as journalists or involved in media.
* Evangelos Kalousis is described as an analyst.

Therefore, Sakis Kechagioglou is the only one who isn't identified as a journalist in the text.
"
"Ke setlhopha sefe sa batho, se se sa umakiwang e le karolo ya matlhabisaditlhong mo teng ga setlhopha sa babueledi sa Bagerika?","The correct answer is **B: Baatlhodi**

The text explicitly states: ""Matlhabisaditlhong mo setlhopha sa sa ithutetseng molao, se upoloditse ditiro tse di seng ka fa malaong tsa baatlhodi..."" which translates to ""In the press, it exposed unethical actions of investigators...""

India e latlhegetswe ke metabogo e le mekae?,"The correct answer is **A: 11**.

The question states: ""Robbin Uthappa o kgonne dira dinno tse di kwa godimo ka metabogo e le 70 mo motshamekong e le 41, a betsa bone ga 11 le borataro ga 2."" This translates to ""Robbin Uthappa can score runs above 70 in an innings of 41 balls, hitting 11 fours and 2 sixes."" The number 11 refers to the number of wickets taken by the opposing team (the bowlers) against Robbin Uthappa.

The passage also mentions India being all out after scoring 36 runs and losing wickets.  However, the question specifically asks how many wickets India was all out for, and the text states they lost ""di-wicket di le supa"" (a certain number of wickets) and scored 36 runs before being all out. The 11 refers to the number of wickets taken by the opposition. Therefore, the answer is 11.
"
"Go ya ka temana,dintlha tse dintsi go feta tsa di- innings?","The correct answer is **A: Metabogo e le 70**.

The question asks how many innings are mentioned in the text. The text states: ""Robbin Uthappa o kgonne dira dinno tse di kwa godimo ka metabogo e le 70..."" which translates to ""Robbin Uthappa was able to score over 70 innings..."". Therefore, the answer is 70.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e seng yone e bakang go kgobega marapo ga Adam Cuerden?","The correct answer is **A: Pholisi e ntšhwa tebang le go bontsha tlhakanelodikobo (A new policy requiring the display of credentials)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Adam Cuerden was flagged for editing in a way that seemed illegal.
* It also mentions he was then flagged for editing *after* a review.
* The core issue was the *way* he edited, not a new policy requiring credentials. The passage doesn't mention any new policy.
* Wales's review and the subsequent legal investigation were the actions that caused the controversy.
* The fact that his edits were not initially edited is a contributing factor, but not the *primary* reason for the controversy, which stemmed from the questionable edits themselves.



Therefore, the new policy about displaying credentials is the least directly related to *why* Cuerden was embroiled in the controversy.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se phimotsweng mo webosaeteng?","The correct answer is **A: Botaki** (Content).

The text explicitly states: ""Tota fela Wales o simolotse ka go re bolelela maaka. Labobebedi, a itira jaaka e kete o re reeditse, fitlhela go phimolwa botaki ja gagwe."" This translates to: ""Just simply Wales started by telling lies. Secondly, he acted as if he had edited, until his content was reviewed.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa tse di latelang tseo Amir Khan a sa di tshegetseng?","The correct answer is **C: Dikakanyo tsa basadi**

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Go tswa mo botennyeng jwa me ke nagana go re basadi ga ba tshwanela go lwana. Ke kakanyo ya me eo."" (From my perspective, I think women should fight. That's my plan.) This clearly indicates he *opposed* women's fighting/competitions.
* He later *supported* British athletes at the 2012 Olympics.
* The Olympics were held in London (but that's not what he supported/opposed).
* He did not support the inclusion of women boxers at the Olympics, as he explicitly stated women shouldn't fight.



Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e Amir Khan a e tshegetsang, go sa kgathalesege gore dikakanyo tsa gagwe ke eng?","The correct answer is **C: Diolimpiki tsa 2012**.

The passage states: ""Kwa ntle ga ditshwaelo tsa gagwe o rile o tla bo a tshegetsa bagaisani ba Boritane kwa Diolimpiking tsa 2012 tse di yang go tshwarelwa kwa London.""  This directly indicates that he supported the British athletes at the 2012 Olympics.

While he may or may not support female athletes in general or athletes in general (options A and D), the passage explicitly mentions his support for the 2012 Olympics. Option B is incorrect because the Olympics were in 2012, not 2004.
"
Peter Lenz o tlhokofetse neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Morago ga go wa mo baesekeleng ya gagwe**.

The passage states: ""Lenz o ile a wa mo sekuteng sa gagwe a bo a thulwa ke mokgweetsi ka ene Xavier Zayat."" This translates to ""Lenz went off his track and was then hit by another driver, Xavier Zayat.""  Therefore, he was injured *after* he went off his track.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka nako ya go tlolatlola, ba ithuthufatsa** - This means ""During the investigation, they are researching,"" which is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Kwa bookelong** - This means ""At the hospital,"" which is where he *was taken*, not where the injury occurred.
* **D: Fa a na le badiri ba kalafi mo tseleng ya tabogo ya mabelo** - This means ""When there were paramedics on the racetrack,"" which is true, but doesn't explain *when* he was injured. The paramedics were *responding to* the injury, not the cause of it.



"
Ke mang Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Mogaisani yo mongwe** (Another driver).

The text states that Peter Lenz was involved in a crash *with* Xavier Zayat (""a thulwa ke mokgweetsi ka ene Xavier Zayat""). This implies they are both drivers.
"
"Ke mo seemong sefe, mo mopalami wa sefofane, yo o tshogileng,a ka nneng a sologelwa mosola ka go tlhaloganya bokafateng jwa sefofane?","The correct answer is **D: Fa letshogo la bone le tswa kwa ditiragalong tse di utlwisang botlhoko, tse di sa amaneng le go fofa.**

Here's why:

The passage states that a confident cyclist might be startled by a strange sound and a sudden braking event.  This suggests a connection between unusual sounds and a feeling of being unsettled or vulnerable. Option D is the only one that describes a sound that could cause this reaction – a sound associated with danger or unexpected events, but *not* directly related to the act of braking itself. The passage emphasizes that feeling this way can help build independent confidence in dealing with unpredictable situations.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tse di latelang se mosepedi yo o nang le kitso ka ditlhwatlhwa, a tshwanetseng go se dira labofelo?","The correct answer is **D: Tlhola webosaete ya boemafofane** (Check motorcycle classifieds websites).

Here's why:

* **The question asks what a knowledgeable buyer should do.** The passage states that experienced buyers often check motorcycle classifieds websites *before* looking at the bike in person and comparing specifications. This is a standard practice to get an idea of pricing, availability, and what's on the market.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Batla tse ditheo tsa mosepele tse dintsi di se kgothaletsang** (Look for many features that are appealing) - While features are important, the passage emphasizes checking classifieds for a *knowledgeable* buyer.
* **B: Beeletsa ka tlhamalalo le ditirelo tsa diphofo** (Communicate clearly with motorcycle dealers) -  While communication is important, the passage focuses on pre-purchase research.
* **C: Bapisa dituelo magareng ga ditheo tse dintsi tsa mesepele** (Compare prices between many motorcycle brands) -  Price comparison is part of research, but the core of the passage's advice is to check classifieds.



Therefore, checking classifieds websites aligns best with the passage's advice for an informed buyer."
"Go ya ka temana, batsamai ba tshwanetse go dira eng pele go bona ditlhwatlhwa tse di gaisang tsotlhe, tsa go fofa?","The correct answer is **A: Tlhola webosaete ya boemafofane**.

Here's why:

The question asks what people should do *before* looking at all the available options for a motorcycle. The text states: ""Malatsing ano go go tšwa leeto ka sefofane ke ka sewelo go beelediwang ka tlhamalalo kwa ditirelong tsa difofane kwa ntle ga go batla pele le go bapisa ditlhwatlhwa."" (These days, planning a motorcycle trip involves looking at options in motorcycle forums without searching first and comparing models.)

This implies that the first step is to explore motorcycle forums (webosaete ya boemafofane) to get an overview of available options *before* engaging in detailed comparisons or looking at specific dealerships.
"
Ke neng fa molekane a tlhokang go pata tsamaiso?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa dilo di romelwa ka dipalangwa tsa dithoto tsa mo moweng** (When items are shipped via the carrier's animal couriers).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Melawana ya difofane e ka se letle go romela dithoto kwa ntle ga mopalami, jaanong ke gone fa wena o tsenang teng."" (Animal couriers might not like to ship items outside of the animal, so that's where you come in.) This means animal couriers are the method being discussed for shipping items, specifically when items are being shipped *via* them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fa setheo se dirisa difofane tsa sone** (When the company uses its own animal couriers): The passage mentions companies having their own animal couriers, but it focuses on using *other* animal couriers.
* **C: Fa dilo di romelwa jaaka morwalo yo o kwadisitsweng** (When items are shipped as a treasured artifact): While the items are valuable, the passage doesn't focus on them being treated as artifacts.
* **D: Fa tsamaiso e tshwerwe ke setheo se segolo** (When the management is controlled by the main company): The passage doesn't discuss company management.



"
"Go ya ka temana,fa o tlhopha tirelo ya difofane ya Frequent Flyer e e mo kgolaganong,ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tshwanetseng go nna ditlapele?","The correct answer is **B: Tirelo ya difofane mo kgolaganong e kgolo go di gaisa** (Frequent flyer programs on airlines with larger fleets are more likely to offer benefits).

Here's why:

* **Fleet Size and Reward Availability:** Airlines with larger fleets typically have more frequent flights and more opportunities for passengers to earn miles.  A larger fleet also means more potential for partnerships with other businesses (hotels, car rentals, etc.), leading to a wider range of redemption options for miles.
* **Competition and Customer Retention:**  Larger airlines often operate in more competitive markets.  They need to offer attractive frequent flyer programs to retain customers.  This means better benefits and rewards.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Boemafofane jo bo neelang dintha tse dintsi go gaisa** (A smaller airline with more flights is more likely): While more flights can *help* you earn miles, a smaller airline might not have the resources to offer generous rewards.
* **C: Tirelo ya difofane e o e palamang gantsi** (A frequent flyer program that is frequently used):  Frequency of use doesn't *guarantee* better benefits.  It's the airline's policy and fleet size that matter.
* **D: Tirelo ya difofane e e ka bong e tsenya ditshiamelo tse di oketsegileng** (A frequent flyer program that includes standard benefits):  This is too general.  While standard benefits are common, a program needs to offer *more* than standard to be considered good.



Therefore, a larger airline is the most likely to offer more valuable benefits within a frequent flyer program.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang a ka neelang dintlha tse dintsi tsa frequent flyer?","The correct answer is **C: Tirelo ya difofane, e o e dirisang gantsi go gaisa,mo kgolaganong enngwe.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks who *might* have earned frequent flyer points.**  The text says frequent flyer points are earned on flights.
* **Option C states ""Tirelo ya difofane, e o e dirisang gantsi go gaisa,mo kgolaganong enngwe""** which translates to ""A frequent flyer, who flies frequently, on another airline."" This fits the context of earning frequent flyer points on flights.  The text mentions the points can be earned with *any* airline.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tirelo e nngwe ya difofane, mo kgolaganong e nngwe:** ""A single frequent flyer, on another airline.""  The word ""single"" is too restrictive. The text implies multiple frequent flyers could accumulate points.
* **B: Tirelo ya difofane, e o e dirisang gantsi go gaisa, mo kgolaganong e e tshwanang:**  ""A frequent flyer, who flies frequently, on a similar airline."" While possible, the text doesn't limit it to only *similar* airlines.
* **D: Tirelo ya difofane e nngwe, ka kgolagano e e tshwanang:** ""A single frequent flyer, on a similar airline."" Similar to B, it's too limiting and the text doesn't imply it's only applicable to similar airlines.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya ditemosi tse di latelang, tse di ka kgorelediwang ke go nwa nnotagi thata?","The correct answer is **D: Monko (Brain)**.

Here's why:

The text states that prolonged alcohol abuse can lead to severe and permanent damage, including brain damage and death.  While alcohol affects many parts of the body, brain damage is a significant and serious consequence mentioned.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kutlo (Hearing):** While excessive alcohol *can* affect hearing, it's not as directly or severely linked to alcohol abuse as brain damage.
* **B: Pono (Reason/Judgment):** Alcohol *does* impair judgment and reasoning, but the text points to more severe and lasting damage.
* **C: Tatso (Taste):**  Alcohol can temporarily affect taste, but prolonged abuse leads to much more serious health problems.



Therefore, based on the information provided, the brain is the most accurate answer.



"
"Jaaka go tlhalositswe mo temaneng, ke eng se se kgonang go fokotsa ditlamorago tse di kotsi tsa bojalwa?","The correct answer is **C: Go nwa bojalwa ka tekanyetso** (To drink alcohol in moderation).

The text explicitly states that knowing your limit is important and that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious health problems, including death.  Option C directly addresses this by recommending drinking in moderation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go nwa nnotagi le methanol** (Drinking alcohol and methanol) - Methanol is a dangerous chemical found in illegal alcohol; it doesn't help reduce risks.
* **B: Go nwa bojalwa jo bo dirwang ka tsela e e sa letlelesegang** (Drinking alcohol that is produced illegally) - Illegal alcohol is *more* dangerous, not less.
* **D: Go nwa le batho ba bangwe** (Drinking with other people) - While social context can influence drinking habits, it doesn't directly reduce the inherent risks of alcohol itself.



"
Ke kae moo tlhwatlhwa ya ditsha e leng magareng ga tse di kwa godimo go gaisa mo Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Kgaolo ya Canal**.

The text explicitly states: ""ditlhwatlhwa tsa ditsha teng ke dingwe tsa tse di kwa godimo ga gaisa mo nageng. **Kgaolo ya Canal**"" (The canals are among the most remarkable in the country. **The Canal District**). This directly links the remarkable canals to the Canal District.
"
Goreng Kgaolo ya Canal e beetswe thoko go nna Lefelo la Ngwao la Lefatshe la UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: Boleng ba kwa re tswang le setso (Its heritage and quality)**.

The text states: ""Kgaolo yotlhe e beetswe thoko go nna Lefelo la Ngwao la Lefatshe la UNESCO ka ntlha ya **setso se se kgethegileng le boleng jwa ditso**..."" which translates to ""The entire area was designated a World Heritage Site due to its **remarkable heritage and quality of its buildings**..."".

While the other options are related, they aren't the primary reason mentioned in the text. The text emphasizes the quality of the heritage and buildings as the key factor in its UNESCO designation.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e dirang gore go etela Phnom Krom go go tswele molemo?","The correct answer is **A: Se o se bonang fa o le godimo ga Tonle Sap**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Phnom Krom is located on a hill overlooking Tonle Sap Lake. Therefore, the view *from* Phnom Krom, looking down at Tonle Sap, is a key benefit of visiting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tsamaya go ralala Angkor Pass:** While you need an Angkor Pass to enter the temple, the *benefit* of visiting Phnom Krom isn't simply obtaining the pass.
* **C: Go bona Siem Reap:** Phnom Krom is *in* Siem Reap, but the passage doesn't highlight seeing the city as a reason to visit the temple itself.
* **D: Leeto la sekepe go ya kwa lekadibeng:** The boat trip to get to Phnom Krom is a *means* of access, not the primary reason for visiting.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se tlhokegang gore baeng ba tsene kwa Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Go bona Angkor Pass**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Teseletso ya Angkor Pass e a tlhokafala fa o batla go tsena mo tempeleng e..."" which translates to ""An Angkor Pass is required if you want to enter the temple..."". 

While options A and D might be things you *could* do, the text clearly identifies the Angkor Pass as a *requirement* to enter Phnom Krom. Option B is irrelevant.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e neng e ka thibela mojanala gore a se etele Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: Tlhwatlhwa godimo ya maeto a bojanala**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Maeto a bojanala a tlhwatlhwa godimo, a tlhoka boitekanelo mo mmeleng..."" This means that the physiological demands of traveling at high altitudes are a major obstacle to visiting Antarctica.  Therefore, avoiding high-altitude travel would prevent someone from visiting Antarctica, based on the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kgatlhego e le yosi, ya go tlhotlhomisa Lewatle la Ross** - While potentially helpful, a volunteer position focused on Ross Sea exploration doesn't directly address the challenges of *reaching* Antarctica.
* **C: Lenaneo la tiro le le kgontshang mosepele ka Sedimonthole le Ferikgong** - A work program in geology and mining isn't related to the difficulties of getting *to* Antarctica.
* **D: Tsamaiso ya mmele e e lekanyeditsweng** - While good physical conditioning is helpful, the passage highlights the specific challenge of high-altitude travel as a major barrier. Physical conditioning alone doesn't overcome that.



"
Mojanala yo o kgatlhegelang go palama dithaba a ka nne a etela karolo efe ya Antartica?,"The correct answer is **A: Lewatle la Ross**.

The text states: ""...go ka etiwa fela ka selemo mo kgweding tsa Ngwanatsele go fitlha go Tlhakole, e bile ga ntsi a felela fela mo pheninsulareng, le tlhaketlhake, le **Lewatle la Ross**.""

This indicates that the Ross Sea is a place where adventurous expeditions to climb mountains might end, as the text suggests. The other options are mentioned as locations where expeditions *end*, not necessarily places where they *begin* or are *likely to be undertaken for mountain climbing*.
"
Ke kae moo lefelo la tshekatsheko ya loapi le dinaledi la pele le ka se nne gone thata?,"The correct answer is **A: Mo lefelong le le fitlhelelwang motlhofo (In remote locations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E re ka kgotlelo ya lesedi mo nakong ya bone ya katlego e ne e se bothata jaaka fa e le bothata gompieno, ga ntsi di fitlhelwa kwa ditoropong kgotsa kwa mafelong a bonno, go le motlhofo go a fitlhelela go na le tse di agilweng mo metlheng ya segompieno.""  This translates to: ""We can imagine the light's brilliance during their time wasn't a problem like it is now, because they were located in cities or in the wild, it was difficult for the observatory to have those available in modern times.""

This implies that the ancient observatories were in remote locations, making it difficult to have the technology we have today.  Modern telescopes are in remote locations because it's crucial to minimize light pollution and atmospheric interference for optimal observation.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mo bogareng ba toropo (In the city outskirts):** The passage indicates that city outskirts are *not* ideal because of light pollution.
*   **C: Kwa lefelong le le kgakala (In the high mountains):** While high mountains are good locations for telescopes, the passage focuses on the *difficulty* of accessing these locations for ancient observatories.
*   **D: Mo lefelong la bonno la mo kholetšhe (In the wild/wilderness):** This is a general term, and while it's true ancient observatories were often in wilderness, option A is more precise in connecting this to the *difficulty* of the environment affecting technology.



"
Thelesekhoupu ya patlisiso ya segompieno e ka bewa kae?,"The correct answer is **D: Mo kagong e kgolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Telescope tsa dipatlisiso tsa segompieno ke dikago tse di boitshegang mo mafelong a a kgakala a a nang le maemo a atemosefiere a a nametsang.""  This translates to ""Modern research telescopes are freestanding structures located on high mountain sites with excellent atmospheric conditions.""

Therefore, they are located in large observatories, often on mountain tops. Options B and C are incorrect because while universities may have telescopes, and some are used for education, the *research* telescopes mentioned are typically very large and specialized and not usually found at universities or educational facilities. Option A is incorrect as well.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke lefelo lefe le le ka tshwanelang go gaisa, letsatsi la go itheetsa kwa lotshitshing la lewatle?","The correct answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Matshitshi a Tamaki Drive a mo Boemakepeng jwa Waitemata, mo mafelong a bahumi a **Mission Bay le St Heliers** kwa Central Auckland.""  This indicates that Mission Bay is a popular spot to go to the beach.

While St Heliers is also mentioned alongside Mission Bay, Mission Bay is explicitly listed as part of the popular beach area. The other options (Bokone jwa Kgaolo ya Boemakepe and Boemakepeng jwa Waitemata) are broader regions, not specific beach destinations."
"Go ya ka temana,maemo a go thuma, a ka nna a babalesega go feta kae?","The correct answer is **D: Long Bay**.

The text explicitly states: ""...a a thuma mo go one, a a batla e le mabopo a a nang le motlhaba e bile go babalesegile go thuma mo one... Matshitshi a a tletse ka malapa ka mabenkele a a farologaneng a a mo letshitshing."" This refers to the area where the ferries depart, and the text mentions the ferries travel from **Long Bay** to Devonport. Therefore, the most dangerous place to send a ferry is Long Bay, as it's where the ferries originate and potential issues could arise there.
"
"Fa o etela lefelo le le tlhalositsweng mo temaneng, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka tsewang e sa tshwanela?","The correct answer is **C: Go dira metlae**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly warns against mimicking the Holocaust or Nazis.**  ""Seke la dira metlae ka Holocaust kana DI-Nazi"" directly prohibits this behavior.
* **Option C, ""Go dira metlae"" (To make fun), falls under this broad prohibition of inappropriate actions.**  Making fun of the suffering of others is deeply disrespectful and insensitive.
* **Other options are not directly condemned in the passage:**
    * **A: Diragatsa maikano (Show respect):** This is the desired behavior.
    * **B: Go tlogela matshwao gongwe mo lefelong (Leave no trace in the place):** This is a general principle of respecting any location.
    * **D: Go kgwarinya motako (To break a window):** This is explicitly forbidden as a destructive act.

Therefore, **Go dira metlae (To make fun)** is the most unsuitable action to take in the described location.



"
Ke efe ya tseno e e tlhalosang dipuo tsa lingua francas?,"The correct answer is **D: Tse di tshelang**.

Here's why:

* **Lingua francas** are languages that develop as a common means of communication between people who speak different native languages. They are typically *living* languages, meaning they are actively used and evolving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsa maitirelo (Auxiliary):** While lingua francas *can* be used as auxiliary languages, this isn't the defining characteristic.
* **B: Tse e seng tsa tlholego (Non-standard):** Lingua francas often become quite standardized over time.
* **C: Itlhametswe (Invented):** Lingua francas are rarely invented; they arise organically from necessity.



"
Ke polelo efe e e sa tlhaloseng dipuo tse di thusang ka nepagalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ke dipuo tse di tshelang, tse di thusang gore puisano e kgonagale magareng ga batho ba ba buang dipuo tse dingwe**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks which option *doesn't* accurately describe the auxiliary languages.** The passage explicitly states that auxiliary languages are ""tsa tlholego kgotsa dipuo tse di tshelang"" (official or existing languages) used to facilitate communication between speakers of different languages.
* **Option A** correctly identifies auxiliary languages as ""dipuo tse di tshelang"" and explains their function - to help communication between people speaking different languages.
* **Options B, C, and D** all describe auxiliary languages in a way that aligns with the passage's description.

Therefore, only option A doesn't offer a *misdescription* but rather a correct description. The question is a bit tricky because it asks for something that *doesn't* describe them accurately, when in fact, it does. However, among the options, A is the one that is the most accurate description.
"
"Go ya ka temana,mopagami o tshwanetse a lebe eng fa leeto la bone la sekepe le le ka mariga?","The correct answer is **D: Nako e e feditsweng mo toropong**.

Here's why:

The question asks what a passenger should expect on a three-day cruise. The passage specifically mentions that the cruise includes time spent in the city of Saint Petersburg. While visas and regulations (B & C) are important to consider *before* the trip, and the location of the ship (A) is relevant, the most direct expectation for a three-day cruise *schedule* is the time spent in port (the city).

Therefore, the passage's focus on sailing and city exploration makes ""Nako e e feditsweng mo toropong"" (Time spent in the city) the most relevant answer.
"
"Go ya ka temana,fa leeto la sekepe la mopalami le le selemo, ke eng seo a ka kgonang go se efoga","The correct answer is **A: Nako kwa toropong** (Time in the city).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Go tsamaya ka sekepe mo Saint Petersburg go akaretsa go tsamaya mo toropong."" (Traveling by ship in Saint Petersburg includes traveling through the city.)
* **The question asks:** What can a passenger on a year-long cruise *gain*? Spending time in the city is a direct benefit of the cruise itinerary.
* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Go tsamaya mo dikgapetleng** (Traveling through islands) - The passage doesn't mention island travel.
    * **C: Ditlhokego tsa Visa** (Visa requirements) - The passage explicitly states that passengers don't need visas (within legal limits). So, it's not something they ""gain.""
    * **D: Saint Petersburg** - While the cruise *visits* Saint Petersburg, the *experience* gained is more about the time spent *in* the city, not just its name.



"
Goreng Secatalan se dirisiwa kgapetsakgapetsa mo matshwaong le dikitsisong mo Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **A: Se tlhaloganngwa ka bontsi go feta se-Spanich** (It is widely used more than Spanish in signs and on the metro).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ka tlwaelo dikitsiso mo Metro di dirwa fela ka se-Catalan..."" (Typically, signs on the Metro are only done in Catalan...). This directly supports the idea that Catalan is used more frequently.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **B: E ne e le leleme la semmuso la ntlha la toropo** (It was the original official language of the city): While Catalan is an official language, the text doesn't say it was the *original* one.
    * **C: Batho ba ikgethela leleme leo kwa Barcelona** (People choose the language in Barcelona): While people have a choice, the text indicates a strong preference and official use of Catalan.
    * **D: Mo Metro le mafelo a mangwe a bosetšhaba, go tla bontsi jwa baagi ba ba buang Secatalan** (On the Metro and other public spaces, there will be many residents speaking Catalan):  While Catalan speakers are present, the text emphasizes the *use* of Catalan in the signage itself, not just the presence of speakers.



"
Ke efe ya diteme tse di latelang e e diriswang ke tsamaiso ya Metro ya kwa Barcelona go dira dikitsiso tsa ka metlha?,"The correct answer is **B: Secatalan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dikitsiso mo Metro di dirwa fela ka se-Catalan..."" which translates to ""Signage in the Metro is only done in Catalan...""
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya ditlamelo tse di latelang e e ka se tseelweng kwa godimo ke bed and breakfast ya maemo a a kwa godimo?","The correct answer is **D: Wi-Fi e e bonako**.

Here's why:

The passage states that luxury bed and breakfasts focus on:

* **Boleng jwa dikobo** (Quality of bedding)
* **Dijo tsa mo mosong** (Fine dining)
* **Didirisiwa tse dintle tsa bogologolo** (Excellent amenities)
* **Ditlhare tse dintle, tse di tlhokomelwang** (Well-maintained furniture)
* **Setheo e katswa e le kago ya bogologolo** (A luxurious setting)

While the passage mentions ""dijo tse di monate tsa setlha se se rileng tsa kgaolo kgotsa sejo sa molaletsi se se kgethegileng"" (delicious, locally sourced cuisine or a gourmet chef's menu), and ""didirisiwa tse dintle tsa bogologolo"" (excellent amenities), it *doesn't* specifically mention Wi-Fi.  And generally, while Wi-Fi is becoming increasingly common, it's not always a defining characteristic of *luxury* establishments in the way the other elements are.

Therefore, Wi-Fi is the least likely of the options to be a primary focus of a luxury bed and breakfast.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e seng nngwe ya dintlhakgolo tsa kgaisano magareng ga di B&B tsa maemo a a kwa godimo?","The correct answer is **C: Maroko a madi a a kwa godimo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that B&Bs struggle with two things when facing high demand: ""boleng jwa dikobo le dijo tsa mo mosong"" (quality of rooms and food).  While the other options are *examples* of things that might be offered at high-end B&Bs, the passage explicitly says that *high costs* (maroko a madi a a kwa godimo) are a *problem* leading to the struggles.  The other options are features or offerings, not a core problem.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang tse di ka se tshwarelweng kwa Beijing ka 2022?","The correct answer is **A: Mekete ya pulo**.

The text states: ""Mokete ya pulo le wa go tswalelwa ga metshameko ya ”Indoor Ice Events” e tla tshwarelwa ko Beijing."" This translates to: ""The opening ceremony and the awarding of medals will be held in Beijing.""

While Indoor Ice Events will also be held in Beijing, the question asks what *can* be held in Beijing, and the opening ceremony/medal ceremony is explicitly mentioned.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditiragalo tsa go relela mo serameng kwa Taizicheng** (Skiing events in Taizicheng): The text says skiing events will be held in Zhangjiakou, not Beijing.
* **C: Mokete wa go tswalelwa ga metshameko** (Awarding ceremony): While the awarding of medals is mentioned, the text specifically mentions the opening ceremony alongside the awarding, and ""Mokete ya pulo"" (Opening Ceremony) is a more direct and encompassing answer.
* **D: Indoor ice events:**  Indoor Ice Events *will* be held in Beijing, but option A is a more specific and direct answer based on what the text explicitly states *can* be held there.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e tla tshwarwang ke Beijing ka 2022?","The correct answer is **A: Metshameko ya Olympics ya selemo**

Here's why:

* The first sentence of the text clearly states: ""Toropokgolo ya China, Beijing e tla tshegetsa metshameko ya Olympics Winter Games ka 2022."" (The city of Beijing, China will host the Winter Olympics Games in 2022.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditiragalo tsa go relela mo serameng di tshwarelwa mo teng ga lefelo** (Skiing events will be held in that location) - While true, this is a specific detail and not the overall event being held in Beijing.
* **C: Diolimpiki tsa mariga** (The Summer Olympics) - The text specifically mentions *Winter* Olympics.
* **D: Mekete ya go tswalelwa ga metshameko** (The event of hosting games) - This is a general description and not the specific event being held.



"
Ke mang a leng kotsing thata ya go tshwaediwa ke mohikelo wa dinonyane?,"The correct answer is **A: Balebeledi ba dinonyane (Young children)**.

The passage specifically states: ""Gantsi go amega batho ba ba berekang le dikoko le dipidipidi, mme fela le balebeledi ba dinonyane le bone ga ba a sireletsega."" which translates to ""Often, people who are in contact with poultry and wild birds get sick, but young children are the ones who are not protected.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, tse di tlhalosang ka nepagalo,mohikela wa dinonyane?","The correct answer is **C: Balebeledi ba dinonyane ba mo kotsing ya go tshwaediwa.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Gantsi go amega batho ba ba berekang le dikoko le dipidipidi, mme fela le balebeledi ba dinonyane le bone ga ba a sireletsega.""  This translates to: ""Often, people who interact with poultry and wild birds get sick, but only the young birds are not protected.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba ba berekang le dikoko le dipidipidi, ke bone fela ba ba tshwaeditsweng ke mohikela** (People who interact with poultry and wild birds are the only ones infected by the virus): The passage says people who interact with poultry and wild birds *get sick*, but it doesn't say they are the *only* ones infected.
* **B: Go begilwe dikgetse di le dintsi mo bathong go feta mo dinonyaneng** (Many cases have started in humans more than in birds):  The passage indicates that *young birds* are not protected, implying that the virus is primarily affecting birds and then potentially spreading to humans. It doesn't suggest the reverse is true.
* **D: Dikgetse tsotlhe tse di begilweng mo bathong, diphelelo e nnile loso** (All cases started in humans, the outcome has been death): The passage doesn't mention death as a result of the infection.



"
White Sea–Baltic Canal e golanyanya eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Lake Onega le River Volga**.

The text states: ""Lecha la Onega le lone le golaganye le Volga, ka jalo o santse o kgona go tswa Caspian Sea o feta ka Russia."" (The Onega Lake also flows into the Volga, thus it was possible to travel from the Caspian Sea through Russia.)  This directly indicates the canal connects Lake Onega and the Volga River. While the canal connects to the Baltic Sea via the Arctic Ocean, the question asks *what* it connects *directly* in terms of bodies of water within Russia.
"
"Go ya ka temana, makwalo a mesepele a ka latiwa ka mofuta ofe wa sepalangwa go itsa go kgaupetsa mopagami?","The correct answer is **B: Diterena tsa bosigo**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Mo ditereneng tsa bosigo, dibukana tsa mesepele di ka tsewa ke babereki ba terena go itsa go kgaupetsa bapalami boroko."" (In subway trains, the gaps between the tracks can be recognized by passengers to avoid stepping onto the tracks).

The other options are not mentioned in relation to passengers identifying gaps for safety.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke neng mo bukana ya gago ya boitshupo e ka tlhatlhobiwang teng mo ditereneng dingwe tse di kgabaganyang melelwane?","The correct answer is **D: Terene e ntse e tsamaya**.

The passage states: ""Mo ditereneng dingwe tse di kgabaganyang melelwane ditlhatlhobo di dirwa mo tereneng e ntse e tsamaya mme o tshwanetse wa nna le boitshupo jo bo siameng mo go wena fa o palama nngwe ya diterena tseo.""  This translates to: ""In other crowded trains, the activities are done on a train that is moving, and you must have a normal posture on your body when you get on one of those trains.""

Therefore, the activity (fatiguing) happens **while the train is moving**.
"
"Ke efe ya dikgang tse di latelang, e e ka nneng ya tlhagelela thata fa o nna kwa lefelong le le gaufi thata le mola wa equator kwa Singapore?","The correct answer is **A: Go thukuthiwa (Flooding)**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** The area near the equator (northern part of Singapore) is prone to heavy rainfall and thunderstorms.
* **Flooding** is a direct consequence of heavy rainfall.
* **Let's look at why the other options are less likely:**
    * **B: Go sa nne le phitlhelelo ya mabenkele (Lack of access to shops):** This is the opposite of what's described in the first part of the question. Singapore is known for its excellent shopping.
    * **C: Go felelwa ke maatla ka ntlha ya mogote (Power outages due to thunderstorms):** While thunderstorms *can* cause power outages, flooding is a more immediate and likely consequence of heavy rain near the equator.
    * **D: Go timela (Stagnant air):**  This isn't directly linked to the weather conditions described in the question.

Therefore, flooding is the most plausible and direct consequence of heavy rain and thunderstorms in a region near the equator like the northern part of Singapore.



"
Ke mang a ka batlang go sa je marotho a Sejeremane?,"The correct answer is **B: Mongwe yo o ratang diphuding tse di nontshang go feta tse dingwe (Someone who likes sweet pastries more than other things).**

Here's why:

* The text describes German doughnuts (Marotho) as sweet pastries filled with jam, often dusted with powdered sugar. 
* The whole passage emphasizes the sugary nature of the Marotho.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mongwe yo mmele wa gagwe o ganwang ke manoko ka tsela e e masisi (Someone whose body is allergic to nuts).** While many German pastries *do* contain nuts, the text doesn't suggest that allergies are a reason to eat them.  The focus is on the taste and sweetness.
* **C: Mongwe yo o sa rateng tšhokolete (Someone who doesn't like chocolate).**  While some variations might have chocolate, the text doesn't make chocolate a defining characteristic of Marotho.
* **D: Mongwe yo o ratang tatso e e botshe thata go na le tatso ya letswai (Someone who likes a strong, bitter taste).** The Marotho is described as sweet, not bitter or strong.
"
Ke sediriswa sefe se se se kaiwang jaaka karolo ya paka e e rileng ya di-pastry tsa Majeremane?,"The correct answer is **A: Diapole (Apples)**.

The text states: ""Tse di apeilweng ka diapole di nna teng ngwaga otlhe..."" which translates to ""Those filled with apples are available all year round...""
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang tse e ka nnang ntlha ya kakantsho ka “traveling on a budget”?","The best answer is **D: Fokotsa ditshenyegelo jaaka dijo le bonno (Reduce expenses like food and lodging)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions ""minimum budget travel"" and ""fokotsa tshenyegelo ya madi"" (reduce expenses).** This directly aligns with option D.
* **Option A (Go theogela o ntse o le mo loetong - Sleeping in hostels) and B (Ikemisetse go latlhegelwa ke manobonobo - Being committed to being exploited) *can* be part of budget travel, but aren't the core principle.** They're *methods* of reducing cost, not the underlying philosophy.
* **Option C (Kopa batho madi - Begging for money) is presented as a *negative* consequence or extreme measure people resort to when budget travel isn't enough.** The passage doesn't frame it as a core principle of budget travel.

Therefore, reducing expenses like food and lodging is the most fundamental principle of traveling on a budget, according to the provided text.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo o ka kgaratlhelang go tsamaya ka madi a a lekanetseng?","The correct answer is **D: Mongwe yo o itumelelang go latela thulaganyo ya loeto (Someone who is able to follow their budget).**

Here's why:

The text describes ""minimum budget travel"" as a way to travel with limited funds. It emphasizes reducing expenses and surviving on very little.  The key phrase is ""minimum budget travel"" which implies strict adherence to a budget. Option D directly reflects this concept.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Mongwe yo o amogelang kgwetlho (Someone who accepts handouts):** While the text mentions begging as a survival tactic, it doesn't define it as the primary characteristic of someone who travels on a limited budget.
*   **B: Mongwe yo o nang le nako e ntsi (Someone who has a lot of time):**  The text focuses on financial limitations, not time availability.
*   **C: Mongwe yo o rulaganyang go dira a le kgakala fa a ntse a le mo loetong (Someone who is resourceful in making themselves useful while homeless):** Resourcefulness is helpful, but the text highlights budgeting as the core element.



"
"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e sa tlhaloseng ka go nepagala,go kgweetsa magareng ga Point Marion le Fairmont?","The correct answer is **C: Selekanyo se se supilweng sa lobelo ga se gantsi se latelwa (The posted speed limit is not always followed).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Go obamela molao wa tsone o o gagametseng go botlhokwa le e leng go feta go na le go se dire jalo.""  This translates to ""Obeying the posted speed limit is important, and it is often not done.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go na le ditsela tse di telele tsa mafelo a a kwa kgakala (There are longer stretches of rural roads):** The passage mentions ""mefologelo, ditselana tse di tshesane, le metsopodia ya tsela e e segogoropo"" (curves, narrow roads, and sharp bends) which implies there *aren't* long, straight stretches.
* **B: Ditselana di a tlhaela (The roads are winding):** The passage mentions curves and sharp bends, confirming the roads are winding.
* **D: Tirelo ya mogala wa letheka ga e a tshwanela go nna e bothata (A leisurely drive is bound to be difficult):** The passage states that a leisurely drive is *hard* to do because of the lack of other settlements. It doesn't say it's bound to be difficult in general.



Therefore, only option C is directly and explicitly addressed in the provided text.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tseno se bakgweetsi ba tshwanetseng ba tshwenyege thata ka sone fa ba kgweetsa mo tselafefong ya Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **C: Go retologa ka bonako mo tseleng e e motsopodia** (Navigating winding roads).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""If you are not accustomed to driving in the countryside, you may be at a disadvantage: due to curves, narrow roads, and winding roads."" It also mentions that the average speed is low due to the curves. This highlights the difficulty of navigating the winding roads.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Go tshwarwa ke pharakano e e kitlaneng** (Being hindered by constant traffic): The passage doesn't mention heavy traffic as a major concern.
* **B: Go tlhoka tirelo e e lekaneng ya mogala** (Requiring adequate off-road driving experience): While some off-road experience might be helpful, the primary difficulty is the winding roads themselves.
* **D: Go kopana le ditiro tsa ditsela kgapetsakgapetsa** (Encountering intersecting roads): The passage mentions narrow roads and curves more prominently than intersecting roads.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa tlhokegeng go simolola motshameko wa go dirisa seketswana?","The correct answer is **D: Go itshidila mmele go le gonnye (Being able to float)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that canyoning involves activities *without* needing to float. It explicitly says: ""mo go sa tlhokeng go itshidila mmele go go ipaakanyetsa..."".  This translates to ""without needing to float, the body must be positioned..."" implying that floating is *not* a requirement.

The other options *are* mentioned as skills involved in canyoning:

*   **A: Bokgoni ba go thuma (Swimming ability):** The passage mentions swimming as an activity involved.
*   **B: Seemo sa mmele se se siameng (Good body control):** The passage mentions body positioning and control as necessary.
*   **C: Kgono ya go tlola (Climbing ability):** The passage mentions climbing (tlola) as one of the activities.



Therefore, being able to float is the skill *not* mentioned or required for canyoning according to the text."
"Ke dife tsa tseno, tse di ka tlhokegang mo loetong lo lo khutswane lwa canyoning?","The correct answer is **A: Bokgoni ba go itshidila mmele jo bo mo maemong a a kwa godimo (The ability to control your body in challenging situations).**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Go sa tlhokeng go itshidila mmele go go ipaakanyetsa (fa go tshwantshanngwa le go palama matlapa, scuba diving kgotsa alpine skiing)."" This translates to ""Without the ability to control your body, it becomes dangerous (similar to paragliding, scuba diving, or alpine skiing).""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Boitemogelo jwa pele ka scuba diving (Prior experience in scuba diving):** While scuba diving involves controlling your body in water, the text specifically mentions that canyoning can be done in dry canyons, and it emphasizes the general ability to control your body in *challenging* situations.
* **C: Go nna le setifikeiti sa canyoneering (Having a canyoning certificate):** The text doesn't mention needing a certificate.  While a certificate is beneficial, the core requirement is body control.
* **D: Bokgoni ba go thuma (The ability to jump):** Jumping is *part* of canyoning, but it's not the *only* or necessarily the *most important* skill.  Controlled body management is more fundamental.



Therefore, the ability to control your body in challenging situations is the most crucial skill for canyoning, based on the provided text."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se ka thusang fa motho a rulaganyetsa go kampa mo koloing ya gagwe?","The correct answer is **A: O itse makoa a koloi ya gago**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fa o tshwantshanya dikoloi tse dikgolwane le ya ga go, o tshwanetse o bo o tlwaetse go kgweetsa ya ga go mme e bile o itse makowa a yone."" (If you compare your car to larger cars, you should be used to driving it and know its quirks.)  Knowing the car's quirks (makowa) is crucial for preventing a roll-over.

While options B, C, and D are all related to safety, they aren't directly addressed as preventative measures against rolling over.  Knowing the car and its handling is the most important factor highlighted in the text.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo ba ba kampelang mo koloing ba ka batlang go se efoga gore ba se bonagale?","The correct answer is **C: Go tlhoma tente mo toropong kgotsa mo lelwapeng la mong.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Go tlhoma tente mo lelwapeng la mong kgotsa toropo go sa kgathalesege go re e botona bo kae go kgona go go biletsa dira."" This translates to ""It is not important whether it is in a private house or in town to pitch a tent, it can lead you to do it."" The question asks what people might want to avoid being seen doing. Therefore, pitching a tent in a public place is the activity people would likely want to conceal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa o na le koloi e tona, ya modiro wa SUV kgotsa bene e nnye:** While owning a suitable car is *necessary* to do what the passage describes, it isn't something people would specifically want to hide.
*   **B: Go tsaya loeto lo loleele la tsela:** Taking a leisurely drive is presented as a normal activity.
*   **D: Go sa tlwaele dikoloi tse ba di dirisang:** Not being familiar with cars is not something people would want to hide; it might even be expected.

"Go ya ka temana, Ke mang yo o agileng Casablanca seša lokgetlho lwa bobedi?","The correct answer is **A: Mapotokisi**.

The text states: ""Ma-Potokisi ba ile ba di thuba mme ba tswa ba di aga sesha ka leina la Casa Branca..."" which translates to ""The Portuguese then took over and built a new city called Casa Branca...""
"
Ke mang yo a ikgatolositseng toropo ya gompieno ya Casablanca morago ga masetlapelo a tlholego,"The correct answer is **B: Mapotokisi**.

The text states: ""Ma-Potokisi ba ile ba di thuba mme ba tswa ba di aga sesha ka leina la Casa Branca, mme morago ga moo ba di ikgatolosa morago ga thoromo ya lefatshe ya ngwaga wa 1755."" (The Portuguese then took it over and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, and later they rebuilt it after the earthquake of 1755.)
"
"Go ya ka temana,Sintra e ne ya tumisiwa ke eng magareng ga batswantle?","The correct answer is **C: Pego e ntle, e e begilweng ke Lord Byron**.

The text states: ""Go ela kwa bokone e bile go fitlhelega bonolo ke toropo ya marato le e kgatlhang ya Sintra le e e neng ya tumisiwa ke batswantle morago ga pego e ntle ya bontle **e e begilweng ke Lord Byron**...""

This directly answers the question of what made Sintra famous among travelers.
"
Ke eng se se tsa tseweng tsia ke Armenia?,"The correct answer is **A: Kgaolo ya Nagorno-Karabakh**.

The passage clearly states that the conflict began over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which was inhabited by Armenians but located within Azerbaijan. The Armenian side sought to control this region.
"
Ke eng se se tsweletseng go goga- goga mo seretseng dikamano tsa magareng ga Azerbaijan le Armenia?,"The correct answer is **C: Dingangisano tsa sepolotiki (Political negotiations)**.

The passage states: ""Dingangisano tsa sepolitiki kaga kgaolo di tsweletse ka go goga goga mo seretseng dikamano tsa magareng ga Armenia le Azerbaijan."" This translates to ""Political negotiations regarding the conflict culminated in heated discussions regarding relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Batho ba letso la Armenia mo lefatsheng la Azerbaijan (Armenians in Azerbaijan):** While the conflict involved Armenians living in Azerbaijan, they weren't the *culmination* of the negotiations. They were a part of the issue.
* **B: Ntwa ya 1994 (1994 Year):** The year 1994 is a timeframe, not the process of negotiation itself.
* **D: Kgaolo ya Nagorno-Karabakh (Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict):** The conflict is the *subject* of the negotiations, not the negotiations themselves.



"
"Fa o pagama tekesi kwa Charlotte, ke eng se se ka dirang gore go nne le tuelo ya tlaleletso?","The correct answer is **B: Go nna le bapagami ba le bararo** (Having three or more passengers).

The text explicitly states: ""Go na le tuelo ya tlaleletso fa bapagami ba feta 2, ka jalo jaana go tura go feta selekanyo."" This translates to ""There is a surge fee if there are more than 2 passengers, therefore it's over capacity.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go nna kwa lefelong le lengwe** (Being in one location) - This is not mentioned as a reason for surge pricing.
* **C: Go ya Uptown** (Going to Uptown) - While the text mentions Uptown Charlotte as having increased ride requests, it doesn't state that going there *itself* triggers surge pricing.
* **D: Kwa ba lelwapa botlhe ba ka ijesang monate** (Where all families can enjoy themselves) - This is irrelevant to surge pricing.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka kaiwang e le se se sa itumediseng ka go nna kwa Charlotte le bana?","The correct answer is **A: Tlhwatlhwa ya matlo (Childcare costs)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that:

* ""Go le ga ntsi banni ba mafelo a mangwe ba kaya fa go bo lefelo leo le siametse malwapa e le lebaka la kokono le le dirileng go re ba hudugele koo, mme le ba ba jelang nala teng ba bona go le motlhofo go le akola le bana ba le teng."" (Many multi-generational families live here because the city is a hub for families and because they feel it's a good place to raise children, and they feel it's a privilege to be able to afford to do so with their children.) This implies a cost barrier.
* ""Mo dingwageng tse di masome a Mabedi tse di fetileng, palo ya tsamaiso e e amogelang maikutlo a bana ko Uptown Charlotte e godile ka palo e e kgatlhisang e e ko godimo."" (In the last twenty years, the number of childcare placements in Uptown Charlotte has grown significantly.)  This directly highlights the increasing cost of childcare.
* ""Ga se ga ntsi ba malapa a Charlotte ba dirisa ditekisi, le fa gone di le mosola mo mabakeng a a rileng.  Go na le tuelo ya tlaleletso fa bapagami ba feta 2, ka jalo jaana go tura go feta selekanyo."" (It's not that many Charlotte families use taxis, and when they do, they are expensive for long distances. There is an estimate that if parents work over 2, it becomes excessive.)  This touches on the cost of taxis, but the main emphasis is on the general cost of raising children.

While the other options might be factors, the passage strongly emphasizes the high cost of childcare as a significant challenge for families in Charlotte.



"
"Pele ga ba-Spain ba  goroga, Chile e e kwa bokone e ne e busiwa ke mang?","The correct answer is **D: Ya Inca**.

The text states: ""Chile e e kwa bokone e ne e busiwa ke Inca..."" which translates to ""Northern Chile was ruled by the Inca...""
"
".Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tse di latelang se se sa diragalang ka 1810?","The correct answer is **A: Go ne go se na puso ya bogareng** (There was no independent government).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Le fa Chile e se na go ikemela ka bo yone ka 1810 (mo gare ga dintwa tsa Napoleon tse di tlogetseng Spain e sena puso ya bogareng e e berekang ka dingwaga di le mmalwa)..."" This means that in 1810, Chile *did not* have an independent government.  It was in the process of establishing one, influenced by the fall of Napoleon and the Spanish government's recent collapse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Chile e fitlheletse go fenya Maspain** (Chile began to fight Spain): The passage mentions fighting *occurred* but doesn't say it *began* in 1810.
* **C: Dintwa tsa Napoleon di lwelwe** (Napoleon's armies were defeated): The passage says the fall of Napoleon *influenced* the establishment of a government in Chile, but doesn't say the defeat necessarily occurred *in* 1810.
* **D: Chile e nnile le boipuso** (Chile became independent): The passage clearly states Chile *didn't* become independent in 1810. Independence wasn't achieved until 1818.



"
Batho ba ka fitlha jang kwa metsaneng mo kgaolong ya Liguria?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka koloi kgotsa ka terena**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ditselana, diterena, le mekoro di kopanya metse e..."" (Boats, trains, and ferries connect the towns...) This confirms that ferries and trains are ways to reach the towns.
* **The text also mentions:** ""dikoloi ga di kgone go goroga go tswa ko ntle."" (cars cannot drive in from outside). This indicates that cars are used *within* the area, but not the *only* way to get there.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that you can arrive by car *or* by train/ferry.
"
Lereo la Sentariane le le reng ‘Cinque Terre’ le raya eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Metsana e Metlhano (Five Lands/Villages)**.

The text clearly states: ""Clique Terra, mo go rayang Mafelo a Matlhano..."" which translates to ""The Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands/Villages...""  The text goes on to list the five villages: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, and Monterosso.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mofuta ofe wa ditlhako o o tshwanetseng maemo a mariga a a ka reledisang?","The correct answer is **A: Ditlhako tsa dikwaekwae tse di tshesane (Small granules)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tomagano ya gona e tshwanetse go nna boteng, 5mm (1/5 inch) kgotsa go feta..."" which translates to ""The aggregate should be between 5mm (1/5 inch) or more in size...""  It also mentions ""Dikweekwee di tshwanetse go nna ko tlase di le bophara."" (""Gravel should be narrow at the bottom."")  Small granules fit this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ditlhako tse di nang le didiriswa tse di ka tshwarisiwang mo ditlhakong tsa mefuta e e farologanyeng ka bontsi (Aggregates with expandable additives):** While the passage mentions additives like calcium chloride, it doesn't specify that expandable additives are *required* for a stable road base.
*   **C: Ditlhako tsa dikwaekwae tse di kwa godimo (Top aggregates):**  The passage specifies the aggregate needs to be *between* 5mm and more, and gravel should be narrow at the bottom - this isn't typical of top aggregates.
*   **D: Ditlhako tse di se nang boteng ba kgatiso ya mm( 1/5 inch) (Aggregates without a 1/5 inch size):** The passage explicitly states the aggregate *must* be at least 5mm (1/5 inch) in size.



"
Ke efe ya tseno e e ka se thuseng go tokafatsa tsamao mo ditseleng tsa metsi a a gatsetseng mo marigeng?,"The correct answer is **B: Matlapana (Calcium Chloride)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mmu, matlapana kana letswai (calcium chloride) ga ntsi di gasame gotlhe mo ditseleng kgotsa ditselana go tokafatsa tsamao.""  This translates to ""For example, calcium chloride (matlapana) or salt (letswai) are often used to melt ice on roads or sidewalks to facilitate traffic.""

Therefore, calcium chloride (matlapana) is mentioned as a substance used to melt ice and facilitate traffic. The other options are not mentioned in the context of melting ice on roads.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e tshwanang sentle magareng ga Hawaii le Setlhaketlhake sa Cook?","The correct answer is **C: Di na le nako e e tshwanang**.

The passage states: ""Re ka di na le nako e e tshwanang le ya Hawaii..."" This directly indicates a similarity in their age or formation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bobedi jwa tsone, di na le dihotele di le dintsi, tse ditona:** The passage explicitly says Cook Islands *do not* have many large hotels.
* **B: Bobedi jwa tsone, ga se leloko la Amerika:** The passage states that Cook Islands are often referred to as ""Hawaii is Australia and New Zealand"" implying they *were* a Polynesian nation, not part of American history.
* **D: Bobedi jwa tsone ga bo na ditoropo:**  The passage says Cook Islands *do not* have any inhabited towns.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo, ditlhaketlhake tsa Cook?","The correct answer is **A: E nnye go feta Hawaii**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""E re ka di na le nako e e tshwanang le ya Hawaii..."" This means Cook Islands are *similar* in time to Hawaii, not ""more than"" Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Ke ditlhopha tsa ditlhaketlhake:** The passage says, ""Ditlhaketlhake tsa Cook ke ditlhopha tsa ditlhaketlhake...""
* **C: Ditoropo tsa konokono ke Rarotonga le Aitutaki:** The passage states, ""Ditlhaketlhake tsa konokono ke Rarotonga le Aitukaki.""
* **D: Naga ya setlhaketlhake e na le nako e e tshwanang le Hawaii:** The passage says, ""E re ka di na le nako e e tshwanang le ya Hawaii...""



Therefore, option A is the only one that contradicts the passage's explicit statements."
Ke afe a mafelo a batlhokomedi ba diparaka a a neelanang ka mefuta e mebedi ya maroko?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The passage states: ""Sirena ke yone fela lefelo la batlhokomedi ba paraka le le neelanang ka lefelo la boroko le dijo tse di bolelo mo godimo ga go kampa."" which translates to ""Sirena is the only place where park rangers are accommodated and where food is provided above the river.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,o ka bona kae teseletso ya go phaka fa o batla go dirisa madi a seatleng go na le dikarata tsa madi?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

The text states: ""Ga kgonagala go bona teseletso ya phaka gotswa go mannong a batlhokomedi kwa Puerto Jiménez, mme ga ba tseye dikarata tsa madi."" This translates to ""It is possible to see travelers in Puerto Jiménez, and they do not carry money cards.""

"Go ya ka temana, ke mofuta ofe wa go skiya o o dirwang go tswa kwa godimodimo?","The correct answer is **C: Mokgwa wa Alpine**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ke sika loo alpine skiing kgotsa moutaineering le fa tota e se selo se le sengwe..."".  This indicates that alpine skiing is one of the types of skiing done from the mountains.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka thusang ba ba skiyang mo sekgweng, ba batla go bona mabelo a a kwa godingwana?","The correct answer is **C: Mo seemong se se siameng**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mo seemong se se siameng o tla kgona go tsamaya sekgela se se leele ka maoto - mme ke ka sewelo o ka bonang mabelo a go ralala naga a go relela mo kapokong ntle le sekgwama se se bokete se se belegwang mo ditselaneng tse di gorutsweng."" (In a proper setting, you will be able to walk a long way - and you can certainly see the beauty of the countryside as you reach the peak without the heavy equipment found on steep slopes.)

This directly links the ability to see the beauty of the countryside (the ""mabelo a a kwa godingwana"") to being in a ""seemong se se siameng"" (a proper setting).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ditlhako tse di tsetsepetseng (Special equipment):** The passage says alpine skiing and mountaineering require *specific equipment*, but it emphasizes the ability to see the countryside *without* heavy equipment.
* **B: Sekgwama se se bokete (Heavy equipment):** The passage states you can avoid heavy equipment in a proper setting.
* **D: Ditselana tse di gorutsweng (Steep slopes):** The passage mentions steep slopes as where heavy equipment is found, implying you want to avoid them to see the countryside.

Batsamai ba ba bowang ba tlwaela botshelo jwa ga bo bone ba se na go nna kwa lefatsheng le sele ba kgaratlhela go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Amogela setso sa lefatshe le sele**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batsamai ba ba amogelang ngwao le botshelo jwa lefathe le sele motlhofo ke bone thatatathata ba a tleng ba sokole go bowa **tlwaela ngwao ya bone fa ba boela gae**.""  This translates to: ""Those who welcome travelers are the ones who will be struggling to **adopt their own language and way of life when they return home**.""

The question asks what returning travelers do to adapt to life in a new land. The passage emphasizes that they need to *adopt the customs of the new land.* Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the passage's explanation of adaptation.
"
"Go ya ka temana, go bowa o tlwaela botshelo ba kwa gaeno o se na go nna kwa lefatsheng le sele, go ka nna bokete thatathata go mofuta ofe wa motsamai?","The correct answer is **B: Batsamai ba ba amogelang setso le botshelo jwa lefatshe le sele motlhofo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batsamai ba ba amogelang ngwao le botshelo jwa lefathe le sele motlhofo ke bone thatatathata ba a tleng ba sokole go bowa tlwaela ngwao ya bone fa ba boela gae."" This translates to: ""Migrants who accept the language and life of the foreign land are the ones who find it difficult to return and adjust to their own language.""

Option B directly reflects this idea. It identifies the difficult migrants as those who accept the language and life of the foreign land. The passage implies that this acceptance makes it harder to readjust to their home culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batsamai ba ba amilweng ke go tlwaela botshelo le ditso tsa lefatshe le sele:** This option suggests the migrants are *accustomed* to the foreign life, which contradicts the passage's point about the difficulty of readjusting.
*   **C: Batsamai ba ba sa ntseng ba tlwaela go nna kwa lefatsheng le sele:** This option describes migrants who *don't* adjust, which isn't the focus of the passage. The passage highlights the difficulty in adjusting *after* some level of acceptance.
*   **D: Batsamai ba ba se nang boitshoko:** This option mentions a lack of confidence, which is not a central theme of the passage."
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e batho ba tshwanetseng go efoga go e dira go moose?,"The correct answer is **B: Atamela o se kelotlhoko**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people hunt moose because they are attracted to the challenge and the thrill of the hunt.  ""O se kelotlhoko"" means ""challenge"" or ""thrill"" in Setswana.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Atamela ka bonya (Observe carefully):** While observation might be part of hunting, it's not the primary reason people hunt moose according to the passage.
*   **C: E iphemela fa e dumela e gomagomediwa botshelo (It allows itself to be hunted for survival):** This is incorrect. The passage implies people hunt moose for sport, not because the moose allows it.
*   **D: Lemoga gore e ka nna borai (Believing it can be dangerous):**  While moose *can* be dangerous, the passage focuses on the *attraction* of the hunt, not the danger.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang ka moose, ga se nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Ke diphologolo tse di mafega (They are small animals)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Phologolo e e bidiwang moose (e gape e itseweng ka leina la elk) ga e bogale..."" which translates to ""The animal called moose (also known as elk) is **not small**...""

Options B, C, and D are all directly mentioned or implied in the passage:

*   **B: Ka dinako dingwe, ba ka baya matshelo a bone mo diphatseng (At times, they can go to pastures)** -  The passage says they go to pastures to survive.
*   **C: Ba ka e atamela ba se kelotlhoko (They can be tamed)** - The passage states that people have tamed moose.
*   **D: Di tla iphemela fa di dumela e gomagomediwa botshelo (They will allow themselves to be domesticated)** - The passage explains they allow themselves to be domesticated.

Therefore, only option A contradicts the provided text."
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang, ke eng se se ka se nneng borai go baeng ba sekaka?","The correct answer is **A: Fa motho a sa apara dilwana tse di bothito mo bosigong jo bo tsididi.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go wela mogote wa mmele thata, go a kgonega fa motho a sa apara dilwana tse di bothitho.""  This translates to: ""A hard bodily sound can occur if a person is not wearing tight clothing.""  This directly links not wearing tight clothing to a hard bodily sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go itemogela meuwane e e dirang ekete o bona metsi (kgotsa dilo tse dingwe).** (To swallow something that makes a sound and see water (or other things).) While mentioned in the first sentence as a possible cause of a sound, it's not the *most direct* cause of a hard bodily sound.
* **C: Go senya maatla fa o latelela dilo tse di seyong.** (To produce force when you swallow things.) Similar to B, it's a possible cause but not the most direct.
* **D: Go senya metsi fa o latelela dilo tse seyong.** (To produce water when you swallow things.) This is incorrect. Swallowing usually doesn't directly produce water.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of what the passage states as a possible cause of a hard bodily sound."
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang , e e sa umakiwang jaaka se se ka nnang borai go basepidi ba sekaka?","The correct answer is **D: Mo mogoteng wa letsatsi**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is *not* typically heard by dogs in a thunderstorm. The passage describes the sounds dogs *do* hear: thunder, rain, the dog's own body noises (like whimpering or panting), and potentially the sound of the dog seeing the rain. Thunder itself isn't a sound *of* the thunderstorm; it's the *result* of the thunderstorm's electrical activity.

Therefore, the thunder isn't something dogs hear *in* the thunderstorm itself, but rather as a consequence of it.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke setlhopha sa baagi bafe se se neng se fokodiwe morago ga gore babatlisisi?","The correct answer is **C: Mataino**.

The text states: ""Go ya ka Fray Bartolomé de las Casas...baagi ba ba-Taino ba ne ba fokoditse thata ke bathopi ba ba-Spain."" This directly indicates that the Taíno people were severely reduced in number after the arrival of the Spanish.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke puo e feng e e neng e buiwa ke Macaribe?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The text states: ""Ba-Caribe e ne e le batho ba puo ya se-Arawakan ba ba gororileng ka mo e ka nnang 10,000 BCE."" (The Taino were people of the Arawakan language who lived there as early as 10,000 BCE.)
"
Ke mang a ka supiwang e le yo o neng a bula lefelo la ntlha la go skiya jaaka itloso bodutu?,"The correct answer is **B: Manowegian**.

The text states: ""Ka ngwaga wa 1861 ma-Norweigan mangwe ba ne ba bula lefelo lwa ntlha la itlosa boduto la go skiya kwa Australia."" which translates to ""In 1861, some Norwegians opened the first ski resort in Australia.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,e ka nna neng fa motshameko wa go skiya o neng o simolola go tseelwa tlhogong?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 BC**.

The passage states: ""Go ijesa monate o itheledia mo kapokong mo ka puo ya seeng go tweng """"skiing"""" go tswa kgakala thata - go na le botaki jo bo supang batho ba dira jalo ka 5000 BC!"" which translates to ""The interest in skiing can be traced back to the origin of the word ""skiing"" - there is evidence that people did this as far back as 5000 BC!""

While the passage mentions the 18th century as the start of modern skiing and 1861 as when the first ski resort opened in Australia, it explicitly states the practice existed as early as 5000 BC.
"
"Ke sefe sa tse di latelang, se, ka tlwaelo,se golagangwang le setlhaketlhake se segolo go feta lewatle la Botlhabatsatsi jwa Afrika?","The correct answer is **A: Tlhotlheletso ya se-Yuropa (European colonization)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ditsamaiso tsa serodumo sa se-Yuropa le bokolone di simologile mo dingwageng tsa bo 14--..."" This clearly indicates that European colonization had a significant and impactful arrival and beginning in the Indian Ocean region.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **B: Tumelo ya Islamic:** While important, the passage mentions the spread of Islam *later* than the arrival of European powers and only in specific areas (Comoros and Mayotte). It wasn't a continent-wide phenomenon like colonization.
* **C: Diphologolo tsa naga (Native cultures):**  The passage acknowledges the existence of native cultures but frames them as being affected *by* the other influences mentioned. They weren't the dominant, overarching influence.
* **D: Mafelo a go iketla a maemo a a kwa godimo (Strategic outposts):** While strategic outposts were important, they were a *result* of European colonization, not the colonization itself.

Therefore, European colonization is the most significant and overarching influence on the Indian Ocean region according to the provided text.



"
Ke eng seo ditlhaketlhake tse dinnye tsa Botlhabatsatsi jwa Afrika di se nang sone? ,"The correct answer is **C: Go lebilwe diphologolo tsa naga**.

The passage states: ""Madagascar ke yone e kgolo mo go tsone tsotlhe, mme e bile go ka twe ke kontinente e e ikemetseng ka nosi fa go lebilwe diphologolo tsa naga."" (Madagascar is the largest among them all, and it can be said to be an independent continent by sea where country products are found.)

The other options are mentioned as characteristics *of* the islands, but the passage explicitly says that Madagascar is independent *because* of its country products.

"Go ya ka temana, Paseka e ketekiwa jang ke dingwe tsa, segolobogolo,dikereke tsa setso?","The correct answer is **C: Ka phuthego e keteka bosigogare go itumelela tsogo ya ga Keresete.**

The text explicitly states: ""Dikereke tsa setso ga ntsi di tshwara Tebelelo ya Paseka bosigo ja Lamatlhatso, ka phuthego e keteka ka bosigogare go itumelela tsogo ya ga Keresete."" (Many traditional churches celebrate Easter vigil on Holy Saturday, in a congregation that celebrates joyfully to celebrate the triumph of Christ.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moletlo o o itebagantseng le tsholo:** While the text mentions the Easter celebration as a symbol of resurrection and triumph over death, this is just *one* aspect of how churches celebrate. It's not the comprehensive answer.
* **B: Go tshwara Tebelelo ya Paseka bosigo ja Lamatlhatso:**  This is *part* of the celebration, but doesn't fully describe *how* churches celebrate.
* **D: Go bona tlhabo ya letsatsi:**  Seeing the sunrise is mentioned as a *symbolic* aspect, not the main way churches celebrate.

"Gore ba seka ba amiwa ke tlhokego eno fa o tsena ka Ecuador,moagi wa Cuba o tshwanetse a nne le eng pele?","The correct answer is **C: Tekete ya leeto la go ya le go boa e tlhokega go supa gore o tsile go nna lobaka lo lo kae.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Baagi ba Cuba ba ba nang le karata e tala ya US ba tshwanetse go etela Kantoro ya Boemedi ya Ecuador go re ba seka ba amiwa ke tlhokego eno."" (Cuban citizens with a valid US visa must visit the Ecuadorian Embassy if they are not exempt from this requirement.)

This implies that if a Cuban citizen is not exempt from the requirement, they need to have a valid travel document (specifically, a visa in this context) to prove where they are from.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lekwalo la mosepele le le letlesegile ka dikgwedi di le 6 ka kwa ga letlha la mosepele** - While the passport needs to be valid for 6 months beyond the intended stay, the question asks what they need *if they are not exempt*.  The visa is the primary document needed to prove origin in this scenario.
* **B: Lekwalo la taletso le le letleletsweng semolao** -  ""Lekwalo la taletso"" translates to ""entry permit"" or ""stay permit,"" which isn't directly mentioned as a requirement for Cuban citizens if they have a US visa.
* **D: Karata e tala ya US** - The text mentions a *valid* US visa for Cuban citizens.  The question implies the visa is not being used (because they are not exempt), and a separate travel document to prove origin is needed.



"
Ditlhokego tsa Ecuador tsa mosepele ga di a direlwa eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Go neelana ka tshedimosetso ya tsa bofudugelo magareng ga dinaga tse pedi.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Ditlhokego tse di diretswe go neelana ka tshedimosetso ya tsa bofudugelo magareng ga dinaga tse pedi."" which translates to ""The requirements were used to provide health information between the two countries.""
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka nnang tlhwatlhwa- godimo kwa nageng e sele go na le kwa lapeng?,"The correct answer is **B: Diforeimi tsa maemo (Frame faults)**.

Here's why:

The question describes a situation where frame faults (diforeime tsa maemo) are more likely to occur in countries with poor healthcare and lower wages. It explicitly states that even with health insurance, the quality of medical care might not be sufficient.  Frame faults are described as being either untrue or being exacerbated by the quality of care available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tlhatlhobiwa matlho (Eye exams):** While important, eye exams themselves aren't directly linked to the problems described in the text.
*   **C: Itshireletso ya tsa pono (Vision protection):** Vision protection is a preventative measure, but the text focuses on *existing* problems related to the quality of care.
*   **D: Diforeimi tse tse e seng tsa maemo (Non-frame faults):** The text specifically mentions frame faults as being problematic."
Ke eng se se ka nnang le matshosetsi ka go reka diforeimi tsa maemo mo nageng e sele?,"The correct answer is **C: Di ka nne di a se nne tsa nnete (They can be fake)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Diforeime tsa maemo fa di bonala mo mafelonga a ntseng jalo go ka nna le mathata a mabedi ; ga se tsa nnete, gape tsa nnete di tura go feta kwa di tswang gone.""  This translates to ""Position frames where they appear in such places can have two problems; they may not be genuine, and even genuine ones are more likely to come from elsewhere.""

Therefore, the primary concern when buying position frames in a country with weak regulations is the possibility of them being counterfeit.  The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Tlhatlhobo e nngwe ya matlho e ka nne ya tlhokega (One type of frame may be needed)** - The passage doesn't discuss frame types.
*   **B: Lekwalo la ngaka la melemo le ka nne la se letlelesege mo diforeiming tse dingwe (A beneficial medical record may not be helpful with other frames)** - The passage implies a medical record *can* be helpful but doesn't state it won't be with other frames.
*   **D: Itshireletso ya bongaka e ka nne ya se duele ditshenyegelo (Health insurance may not cover regulations)** - The passage doesn't discuss health insurance covering regulations.

"Tebang le tiriso ya ledi kwa Falklands, ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang e e leng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Kwa ntle ga ponto ya Falkland , ponto ya Boritane, go le gantsi, e amogelwa gongwe le gongwe.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Diponto tsa Borithane go le ga ntsi di amogelwa gongwe le gongwe mo ditlhaketlhakeng le mo dikarateng tsa molato tsa Stanley mme le didolara tsa United States le tsone ga ntsi di a amogelwa."" This means British pounds are commonly accepted outside of the main bank.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go amogelwa fela dikarata tsa molato le diponto tsa Boritane (GBP) , mo ditlhaketlhakeng tse di ikadileng mo mafelelong** - The passage mentions US dollars are also widely accepted.
*   **B: Stanley ke lone fela lefelo le le tla amogelang didolara tsa United States** - The passage says British pounds and US dollars are widely accepted in Stanley.
*   **C: Diponto tsa Falkland di tshwanetse go ananywa morago ga go tswa mo ditlhakatlhakeng** - The passage states that money transfers *must* happen *before* leaving the bank.



"
"Go ya ka temana,fa o ya Falklands, o tswa United States, ke kae moo mokgwa wa tuelo, kwa ntle ga karata ya molato, o tla nnang molemo thata?","The correct answer is **C: Ke di ikadileng mo mafelelong**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mo ditlhaketlhakeng tse di ikadileng mo mafelelong dikarata tsa molato go ka direga di seka tsa amogelwa..."" This translates to ""In isolated establishments on the outskirts, credit cards may not be accepted...""

Therefore, if you're outside of a bank (like FIC West) or a general store in Stanley, you'll likely have difficulty using credit cards.



"
Ke moletlo ofe o o sa golaganang le go dirwa ga meletlo ya tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsalwa ga tlou (Birth of a Cow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that most temple festivals are celebrated to commemorate the temple's foundation, a specific day of a deity's birth, or a festival related to the temple.  It explicitly says that the temple festivals of Kerala are *rarely* accompanied by the depiction of cows or other animals. 

Therefore, the birth of a cow (Go tsalwa ga tlou) is the option that doesn't align with the typical reasons for celebrating temple festivals as described in the text.  The other options (commemorating the temple, deity's birth, and temple-related festivals) *are* mentioned as common reasons.



"
Ke kae moo ditlou tse di kgabisitsweng di ka bonwang teng?,"The correct answer is **A: Gongwe le gongwe, go tswa bokhutlong jwa Ngwanatsele, go fitlha Motsheganong e le fa gare**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bontsi jwa meletlo ya tempele bo dirwa ele bontlhabongwe sa segopotso sa tempele, letsatsi la matsalo la modingwana yo ka nako eo a ikametseng tempele kgotsa moletlo mongwe le mongwe fela o o amanang le tempele. **Meletlo ya ditempele tsa Kerala e kgatlha fela thata, go etle go bonagale gape le ditlou tsedi kgabisitsweng, baopedi ba kereke letse dingwe.**""

This means the decorated elephants are seen *along the route from the temple to the festival grounds*. Option A best reflects this.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mekgwa efe ya e e latelang, ya go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa mo karolong ya tsa bagwebi kgotsa ya maemo a ntlha?","The correct answer is **A: Kopa ba setheo sa gago go go duelela (Asking for a loan from your peers).**

Here's why:

The text states: ""ga gona mosola wa go re o leke go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa fa o le mo karolong ya kgwebo, kgotsa ya maemo a ntlha, mo sefofaneng se se tlhamalelang go tswa lefelo A go ya B.

This translates to: ""there is no practice of seeking a loan if you are in the business sector, or in the short term, on a plane that travels from point A to point B. However, what is true is that you can borrow a larger amount than usual if you use the business sector, and more with some and others in the short term.""

The text explicitly highlights that asking peers for a loan (Kopa ba setheo sa gago go go duelela) is associated with borrowing larger amounts, especially in the short term.  Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the text.



Therefore, option A is the best answer based on the information provided.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se go ka se nneng mosola go se batla fa o batla go dirisa dikarolo tse di rileng tsa sefofane?","The correct answer is **C: Go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa (Being charged more)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ga gona mosola wa go re o leke go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa fa o le mo karolong ya kgwebo, kgotsa ya maemo a ntlha..."" which translates to ""there is no buyer who tries to be charged more in the cargo or high-altitude section...""  This directly indicates that people *don't* want to be charged more.

The passage also mentions that ""ditheo tsa difofane ba itse sentle go re go na le setlhopha sengwe sa bafofi se se ikeetleditseng go duela madi a mantsi go bona tshiamelo ya go ya sepela ka bonako ba sosologile; ka jalo ba ba batla dituelo tse di maleba."" This means that people who are traveling for pleasure *don't* want to be charged more, and they are willing to pay for better service. Therefore, they would not be looking for better service if they were being overcharged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Difofane tse di tlhamaletseng (Expensive airplanes):**  While expensive airplanes *might* be associated with charging more, the passage focuses on the *buyer's* perspective - they don't want to be charged more.
*   **B: Karolo ya kgwebo (Cargo section):**  The passage says there are no buyers who try to be *charged more* in the cargo section. It's not about a preference for the cargo section itself.
*   **D: Maemo a ntlha (High-altitude section):** Similar to the cargo section, the passage emphasizes the *charge* itself, not a preference for the high-altitude section.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: Go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa (Being charged more)**."
Ke eng se se sa tlhokeng go tsenngwa fa o bapisa palogotlhe ya go ya Aforika le madi a go ralala lefatshe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditshenyegelo tse di okeditsweng ke dibukana tse dingwe tsa mesepele ko ntle ga Aforika** (Expenses incurred by other airlines outside of Africa).

The question specifically asks what should *not* be included when comparing the revenue to Africa and global revenue. The passage states that expenses incurred by other airlines *outside* of Africa should be included when calculating the total revenue for the comparison.  Therefore, expenses incurred by other airlines *outside* of Africa should *not* be excluded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditshenyegelo tsa makgetho a mesepele mo Aforika** (Expenses of other airlines in Africa): These *should* be included in the Africa revenue calculation.
* **C: Ditshenyegelo tsa makwalo a mosepele a Aforika** (Expenses of other airlines in Africa): Similar to B, these *should* be included in the Africa revenue calculation.
* **D: Ditshenyegelo tsa dipalangwa tsa mafelo a a leng kwa ntle ga Aforika** (Expenses of airport fees outside of Africa): These *should* be included in the global revenue calculation, as the passage mentions including other costs at destinations outside of Africa.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se marekisetso a simolotseng go se kabakanya?","The correct answer is **A: Dijo tse di apeetsweng ruri**.

The text explicitly states: ""Marekisetso a simolotse go oketsa le go kabakanya dijo tse di apeetsweng ruri."" This translates to ""The stores started to sell and package leftovers.""
"
"Ke eng se se tlamelwang ke marekisetso a mangwe, se se ka kgatlhang bareki ba dijo tse di apeetsweng ruri?","The correct answer is **D: microwave**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dingwe tsa tsone e bile di na le di-microwave le methale e mengwe ya go thuthafatsa dijo."" (Some of them have microwaves and other appliances to heat food.) This indicates that microwaves are a feature offered by some food stores, and therefore something a customer might find appealing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Marekisetso a dijo (Food stores):** While the passage is about food stores, the question asks about something *offered by* the stores to customers.
* **B: Dijo tse di sa kabakangwang thata (Hard-to-digest food):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about the digestibility of the food.
* **C: Dijo tse tala (Fresh food):** The passage is specifically about *prepared* food, not fresh food.



"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang tse di ka nneng di a se tlhaloganngwe ke ba-Belgium le ba- Switzerland ba ba buang Sefora?,"The correct answer is **A: Thulaganyo ya dinomore ya Sefora**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Segolobogolo, thulaganyo ya dinomore ya Sefora sa Belgium le Switzerland e harologana go go le gonnye le Sefora se se buiwang kwa Fora...""  (Essentially: ""Generally, the numbering system of Sephora in Belgium and Switzerland is the same as in Sephora in France..."")

The other options are related but not the *primary* point of similarity. While they *are* similar, the consistent numbering system is the most direct and fundamental similarity mentioned in the text.
"
Ke eng sa tse di latelang se se farologaneng kwa France jaaka se le mo Belgium le Switzerland?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka fa mafoko otlhe a bitswang ka teng (All the words used)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that besides the number format, the words used to refer to things are also different in France compared to Belgium and Switzerland.
* Options B (Number format) and C (Standard vocabulary) are mentioned as being *similar* between France and Belgium/Switzerland.
* Option D (Other Sefora words) is also mentioned as being different.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the *entire vocabulary* used by Sefora differs between France and Belgium/Switzerland.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ditlamo tsa difofane tse di neelanang ka se di akaretsa Air Canada, Delta Airlines, le Lufthansa mo difofaneng tse di emelelang go tsa kwa Amerika le Canada, le WestJet.""  and ""Mo maemong otlhe, o tshwanetse go tsenya kopo ka mogala ka tlhamalalo kwa difofaneng."" However, the question asks *where* you would receive discounted fares. The passage specifically associates discounted fares with WestJet. The other options are either incorrect based on the passage or lack sufficient information to be definitively correct.
"
Ke eng se e leng nnete ka ditlhwatlhwa tsa go ya diphitlhong ka tshoganyetso?,"The correct answer is **D: O tshwanetse go tsenya kopo ka mogala ka tlhamalalo kwa difofaneng.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Mo maemong otlhe, o tshwanetse go tsenya kopo ka mogala ka tlhamalalo kwa difofaneng."" (In all cases, you must apply in person with a detailed application to the airline.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di duela ditlhwatlhwa tsa bapagami ba ba yang diphitlhong ka tshoganyetso** (They require detailed applications from those applying for early flights) - This is partially true, but doesn't capture the full meaning of the sentence. It doesn't specify *how* the application must be made.
* **B: O tshwanetse go tsenya kopo ka tlhamalalo mo webosaeteng ya ditlamo tsa difofane** (You should apply in person on the airline's website with a detailed application) - The text says ""ka mogala"" (in person), not ""mo webosaeteng"" (on the website).
* **C: Ba duelela go fofa ga tshoganyetso** (They allow for early boarding) -  This is not mentioned in the text. The text discusses the requirement for a detailed application, not early boarding.

Ke neng fa tiriso ya GPS e e ikemetseng ka nosi e leng botoka le go feta ditiriso tsa GPS tsa go supa tsela mo mogaleng wa gago wa letheka?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa o leka go babalela madi**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that using a standalone GPS is more convenient and reliable than relying on GPS in a network-limited area. However, it also mentions that standalone GPS devices can be expensive (requiring purchase or rental).  Therefore, the statement that standalone GPS is ""more convenient and reliable"" is *accompanied by a cost*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fa o tlhomamisitse gore o tsile go nna le kgolagano ya inthanete:**  This is the *opposite* of when standalone GPS is more beneficial.  If you have internet, you can use online map services.
* **C: Fa o se na neteweke:** This *supports* the idea of using standalone GPS, but doesn't explain *why* it's more convenient.
* **D: Fa o sa batle go hira tiriso:**  Hiring a GPS is just one way to get one; it doesn't inherently make standalone GPS more convenient.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that standalone GPS is more convenient, *but at a cost.*



"
Ke eng se e seng lebaka le le siameng go dirisa ditiriswa tsa go supa tsela mo mogaleng wa gago wa letheka go na le tiriso e e ikemetseng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go sa tlhoke go tshwenyega ka kgolagano ya inthanete (Not needing internet connectivity)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Fa o sena kgolagano ya inthanete mo mogaleng wa gago, kana fa go sena neteweke, tiragatso ya tsone e ka nna ya lekanyediwa kgotsa ya seka ya nna teng.""  This means GPS devices *rely* on internet connectivity for accurate and up-to-date information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Boloka madi (Save money):** While GPS can potentially save money in the long run by avoiding getting lost and wasting fuel, the initial purchase or rental cost isn't necessarily a reason *not* to use them.
* **C: Go tila go hira (Avoiding renting):**  Renting is an option, and avoiding it isn't a reason the device wouldn't be useful.
* **D: Go sa tlhoke go reka di mmepe tse diša (Not needing to buy new maps):**  Modern GPS devices often have maps built-in, but they still might need updates, and even with built-in maps, a reliable internet connection is often required for accuracy.



"
"Go ya ka temana, o ka netefatsa jang gore o nyalanngwa le sekepe se se maleba?","The correct answer is **C: Buka le modiredi yo e leng moitseanape wa maeto a Galapagos.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of having an experienced Galapagos guide.** It explicitly states, ""Netefatsa gore modiredii yo o bukang mo go ene ke moitsaanape wa Galapagos yo o nang le kitso e e tseneletseng ka mefuta ya dikepe tse di farologaneng."" (Ensure the person taking you on the trip is a Galapagos local with extensive knowledge of different ship types.) This is the most direct and reliable way to ensure you're paired with a suitable vessel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ipeela sebaka sa setlhopha sa bapagami ba le 8+, ba dikeletso tse di tshwanang (Choosing a group of 8+ passengers with similar belongings):**  While having a group is common, it doesn't guarantee a suitable ship. The ship's capacity and type are still key.
* **B: Go ipeela sebaka sa paka ya fa di sa palangwe thata (Choosing a spot on a difficult-to-dock harbor):** This relates to the logistics of docking, not the suitability of the ship itself.
* **D: Go ipeela sebaka go sa le gale thata (Choosing a spot that's not difficult to dock):** Similar to option B, this concerns docking difficulties, not ship suitability.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang,e e sa dirisweng jaaka metlhale ya go dira gore bareki ba nne nako e ntsi mo teng?","The correct answer is **A: Lesedi la tlhago ka bontsi (Bright lighting)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how casinos use various tactics to keep people playing for longer. It explicitly mentions:

*   **Lack of clocks and schedules:** To make people lose track of time.
*   **Difficult-to-see payouts:**  Making it hard to realize how much they're losing.
*   **Attractive food and drinks:**  To create a pleasant environment and encourage staying.
*   **Free drinks:** A classic tactic to loosen inhibitions.
*   **The act of not being paid out:**  A psychological tactic to encourage further play.

Bright lighting, in contrast, is generally considered a standard feature in casinos and not a deliberate manipulation tactic used to keep people playing longer. Options B, C and D are directly mentioned as tactics used to make people spend more time in casinos.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo mankge wa go betšha a tshwanetseng go se tila?","The correct answer is **A: Go tagiwa thata (Having difficulty saying no)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Gantsi ga gona matlhabaphefo le tshupanako, le mabati a go tswa ga a bonale bonolo. ...ka jalo, mme bomankge botlhe ba go becha ba itsi bomosola jwa go sa tagiwa."" (There are often no temptations and no distractions, and the winnings are not easily visible...therefore, all gamblers know the danger of not saying no.)

This clearly indicates that the difficulty in resisting the lure of the casino and the temptation to gamble is the key issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Amogela ditlhotlheletso dingwe le dingwe (Accepting other incentives):** While casinos offer incentives, the core problem is the inherent difficulty in resisting the gambling itself.
* **C: Tlhola ditshupanako (Seeking distractions):** The text says there *aren't* many distractions, implying that distractions aren't the primary issue.
* **D: Go botsa ka mabati a a gaufi a go tswa (Asking about nearby winnings):** This is a tactic used *by* the casino, not a characteristic of the gamblers themselves.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke karolo efe ya puo e e simololang ka tlhaka e tona, le fa e le fa gare ga seele?","The correct answer is **A: Madiri**.

Here's why:

The question states that ""Se ke tsela e e botlhokwa ya go farologanya madiri le dilo"" which translates to ""It is an important way to expand words and things.""  This directly refers to **madiri** (verbs). Verbs are the words that describe actions, and expanding your verb vocabulary is crucial for expressing a wide range of ideas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mafoko (Words):** While words are important, the passage specifically emphasizes *expanding* verbs.
* **C: Matlhaodi (Nouns):** Nouns represent things, and while important, the passage focuses on the active aspect of language – actions (verbs).
* **D: Matlhalosi (Adjectives):** Adjectives describe nouns, and the passage doesn't focus on them.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka ketefatsang thata, go simolola mafoko ka ditlhaka tse di tona?","The correct answer is **A: Go buisa (Speaking)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that speaking always starts with a need, even if it's internal. The question asks what is *most difficult* to start with one's needs when speaking. Therefore, the answer is speaking itself. The other options (sharing ideas, writing, sharing things) are all things that *can* be linked to needs, but the passage specifically highlights speaking as being inherently tied to need.
"
"Kwa magaeng a kwa Malaysia, ke letshwao le feng le le rayang gore “tlaa kwano”?","The correct answer is **A: monwana wa bosupa o lebile mo mmeleng**

The passage explicitly states: ""Kwa Malaysia, bobotlana mo go ba letso lwa Ba-Malay kwa magaeng, go raya go re """"tla kwano,"""" go tshwana le **monwana wa bosupa o lebile mo mmeleng**..."" which translates to ""...In Malaysia, shaking hands is a sign of respect among the Malay people at home, it is said to be """"welcome,"""" it is like a **handshake that has been returned**...""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke letshwao lefe le le ka rayang gore “bowa”?","The correct answer is **C: Go tsholetsa letsogo ka seatla se lebile motho yo o mo sadisang sentle**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mo go tshwanang, mosepedi wa moBorithane kwa Spain a ka dira phoso ka go akanya go re go tsholetsa letsogo fa o sadisa sentle ka seatla se lebile motho yo o go sadisang sentle, (e seng yo o sadisiwang sentle) e le sesupo sa go re boela kwano."" 

This directly links the act of briefly touching someone's arm while shaking hands (which is done well) to the custom of ""boela kwano"" (returning to normalcy or familiarity) in Spain, and the potential for a faux pas.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se dirileng gore go nne le diphatlha tse di bipilweng ke marogo?","The correct answer is **A: marogo a kapoko**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what causes the formation of detached scales.** The passage explicitly states: ""Kgatselo e e tsamayang ga e a itshetlela, mme e elela mo thabeng. Se se kgona go dira go re marogo a kapoko a bipege a bo a sa bonale."" (The moving scales retreat and land on the mountain. This can cause detached scales to form, even if they are not visible.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kgatselo tse ditona di tlabe di kgokologa go tswa mo matlhakoreng** (The dead scales will crumble from the surface): While this happens, it's not the *cause* of detached scales forming in the first place. It's a result.
* **C: Mabota a magaga a metsi a a gatsetseng a kgona go phutlhama** (The dried-up scales can crack):  Like B, this is a process that happens to scales, but doesn't directly explain *how* detached scales are formed.
* **D: Kgatselo tse di tona tla bo di robega** (The dead scales will become hard): Again, a process that affects scales, but not the initial formation of detached scales.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer based on the passage is that **marogo a kapoko (detached scales)** are the cause of the detached scales.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tseno e e ka bipiwang ke Marogo a kapoko?","The correct answer is **A: Diphatlha (Fungi)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko dithokong tsa kgatselo e, kgatselo tse di tona tla bo di robega, di wela fa fatshe kana di tlola kana di kgokologa go tswa mo matlhakoreng.""  This translates to: ""In the fruiting bodies, mature spores will become heavy, fall to the ground, or fly or be carried away from the mycelium.""

The passage also mentions ""diphatlha tsa teng di kgona go tswalaga"" which translates to ""the spores are able to be produced"".  Spores are the reproductive units of fungi, and fungi are commonly referred to as ""marogo a kapoko"" (molds) in the context of this passage.

Therefore, the passage directly links spores (diphatlha) to the fruiting bodies of the mold, indicating that fungi (and by extension, their spores) are what are produced and can be dispersed by the mold.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Magaga a dikgapetla (Pollen grains):**  Pollen is produced by plants, not fungi.
*   **C: Mabota (Seeds):** Seeds are produced by plants, not fungi.
*   **D: Kgatselo tse di tona (Mature fruiting bodies):** While mature fruiting bodies *contain* spores, the passage specifies that the spores *themselves* are what are dispersed.



"
"Go ya ka temana,basepedi ba tshwanetse ba batlisise pele ka seemo sa lefelo lefe?","The correct answer is **B: Mafelo a kwa ntle ga Goma**.

The text states: ""Le fa Goma e sireletsegile, mesepele epe kwa ntle ga Goma e tshwanetse go batlisisiwe pele ka yone go tlhaloganya seemo jwa ntwa e e tswelelang mo kgaolong ya Kivu Bokone."" (Even though Goma is protected, all the areas outside of Goma must be checked first to understand the evolving situation in the Kivu Bokone region.)



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lekgwamolelo la Nyiragongo:** While Nyiragongo is mentioned, the text emphasizes checking areas *outside* of Goma first.
*   **C: Mo bogareng jwa toropo:** The text says Goma is protected, so there's no need to check *inside* the town for a general situation assessment.
*   **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda is mentioned in relation to the Nyiragongo volcano, but not as the primary area to be checked for the overall situation in Kivu Bokone."
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka se nneng keletso e e siameng go mosepedi mo Goma?,"The correct answer is **D: Lekgwamolemo la kwa Nyiragongo le ne la apesa toropo.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ka ngwaga wa 2002 lefelo la Goma le ne la senngwa ke seretse se se elelang gotswa mo lekgwamolelong la kwa Nyirango le le neng la apesa mebila ya toropo, segolobogolo mo bogareng jwa toropo."" This translates to ""In 2002, the town of Goma was covered by ash from the Nyiragongo volcano, which had flooded part of the town, near the town's center.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dintwa tsa kwa North Kivu di tlosa bodutu:** While North Kivu *does* have many minerals, the text doesn't specifically say the *animals* there are mining them.
* **B: Ke nngwe ya mesepele ya go lepa di-gorrilla tsa Dithaba, e e tlhwatlhwatlase:** The text *does* mention Goma is near a gorilla conservation area, but it doesn't say Goma itself is a conservation area.
* **C: Dithekesi tsa sekuta ke tsela e e siameng ya go tsamaya:** The text *does* say you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma, but it doesn't say it's the *most common* or *usual* way.



"
"Teseletso ya go kampa kwa lefelong le le kgakajana, ya letsatsi la ntlha la Phatwe e tsile go nna teng neng?","The correct answer is **C: 1 tsa Motsheganong**.

The passage states: ""Ka jalo, tetla ya go kampa gope fela mo mafelong ao e simololang ka Motsheganong e nna teng ka di-1 tsa Ferikgong."" This translates to ""Therefore, the lottery for campsites only in the campgrounds that start with the Backcountry begins on the 1st of the month.""  The question asks where the lottery begins.
"
Ke pholisi efe e e beilweng go sireletsa legope?,"The correct answer is **B: Diteseletso di nna teng fela ka 1 tsa Ferikgong**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka jalo, tetla ya go kampa gope fela mo mafelong ao e simololang ka Motsheganong e nna teng ka di-1 tsa Ferikgong."" This means permits are only available on the first day of the month for reservations made four months in advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba tla thusiwa go ya ka gore go tsile mang pele:** This refers to the lottery system, not the location or availability of permits.
*   **C: Ditetla di bonwa fela ka dikopo tsa go tsena fela o tsamaya ka dinao:** The passage states permits are needed to protect the wilderness and are available at the beginning of the month.
*   **D: Palo ya ditetla ga e ntsi thata:** The passage states that permits for popular campgrounds are difficult to obtain and are often fully booked on the first day of the application period.

"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e ka se tsogeng e bonwe kwa mefuteng ya dihotele tse di tlhalositsweng mo temaneng?","The correct answer is **C: Go ne go nna bahumi le batho ba ba itsegeng thata ba nako eo.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Diotela tse ke kwa go tsone go neng go nna bahumi le batho ba ba itsegeng thata ba nako eo..."" (These hotels were frequented by wealthy travelers and difficult people of that era...)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Bara ya nnotagi e e tswakantsweng le dilo dingwe:** While luxury hotels *might* have had some decorative items, the text doesn't focus on specific items like perfume bottles.
* **B: Direseturente tsa maemo a a kwa godimo:** The text mentions that these hotels sold high-quality food, implying restaurants, but it's not the *most* prominent feature discussed.
* **D: Diphaposi tse di ntšhafaditsweng sešeng jaana ka ditlhabololo tsa segompieno:** This option is completely irrelevant. The text describes historic luxury hotels, not modern-day themed rooms.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e tlhagisitsweng mo temaneng ke efe ya tse di neelwang mo hoteleng, tse bajanala ba ka se di tseyeng tsia?","The correct answer is **D: Dituelo tsa boroko tse di tlhwatlhwa-tlase (Fine lace)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mekgabisa ya bogologolo, letlhoko la ditlamelo tsa sesha, **le go bo e le tsa dinako tsele tsotlhe ke dingwe tsa dilo tse di dirang go re di nne dintle le go feta.**""  It then mentions these were enjoyed by the wealthy and travelers, and that a wealthy person could travel the world visiting these hotels.  Finally, it says these hotels were sometimes used by royalty and dignitaries.

Of the options provided, fine lace (dituelo tsa boroko tse di tlhwatlhwa-tlase) is the most likely item a wealthy person staying in these opulent hotels would enjoy and that a traveler could reasonably expect to find. The other options are less consistently mentioned as standard features.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se basepedi ba ba etelang Greenland ba tshwanetseng go se tila?","The correct answer is **B: Go tsamaya ka diaparo tse di bothitho tse dintsi, ka phetogo ya loapi, ka tlwaelo, e le bothito ngwaga otlhe.**

The text explicitly states: ""Bokebekwa, le go ilwa ga batswantle ka kakaretso, ga go itsagale gotlhe gotlhe kwa Greenland. Tota le e leng mo ditoropong, ga go na """"mafelo a a kotsi."""" Maemo a bosa a a tsididi ke nngwe ya diphatsa tsa nnete tse ba ba sa ipaakanyang batla itemogela tsone. **Go etela lefatshe la Greenland ka paka ya mariga (gakologelwa gore fa o ntse o tsamaela bokone, go nna tsididi le go feta), go botlhokwa go tsamaya ka diaparo tse di bothitho tse dintsi.** Malatsi a a maleele a selemo a ka dira go re go nne le mathata a go robala sentle le mathata a botsogo a a amanang le gone.""

Option A is incorrect because while internet access is available, it's not mentioned as something visitors *must* prepare for.

Option C"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang , e e ka nnang bothata go baetii ba ba etelang Greenland ba sa ipaakanya?","The correct answer is **C: Maemo a bosa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Maemo a bosa a a tsididi ke nngwe ya diphatsa tsa nnete tse ba ba sa ipaakanyang batla itemogela tsone."" (The harsh weather is one of the truths that those who do not expect to experience want to encounter.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Monang o o bidiwang Nordic:** The text mentions ""Nordic"" in the context of a specific type of blanket, not as a general problem for visitors.
*   **B: Bosenyi:** While potentially a challenge, the text doesn't highlight ""bosenyi"" (loneliness) as a significant concern for visitors. It focuses more on the physical environment.
*   **D: Banni ba selegae:** This translates to ""foreigners"" and isn't a specific environmental or cultural issue outlined in the text.

Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text is **Maemo a bosa (Harsh weather/Climate)**.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ga jaana e diriswang jaaka marekelo a konokono?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ga jaana Templo de San Diego e leng yone fela kago e e santseng e le gone. **Ga jaana e dirisiwa jaaka marekelo a konokono**, mme e nna e na le dilo di le dintsi tse di diragalang mo go yone, motshegare le bosigo."" (The Templo de San Diego is not the only one that used to be there. **It is not used as a public restroom**, and it has many things happening in it, day and night.)

The other options are described as places where things happen, but not specifically as restrooms.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa bonweng mo Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: Tiragatso ya konsarata ka fa tlase ga moriti wa sekgele**.

The text explicitly states that ""e ga jaana e dirisiwa jaaka marekelo a konokono, mme e nna e na le dilo di le dintsi tse di diragalang mo go yone, motshegare le bosigo. Go nale mafelo a le mantsi a go ja a a dikanyeditseng tshingwana, e bile ka thapama le maitseboa ditiragatso koo gantsi di direrelwa ka fa tlase ga moriti wa sekgele."" This means concerts *do* happen there, but it's not primarily known as a concert venue.

The other options are all things the text *does* mention as being present in Jardín de la Unión.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke dife tsa dipolelo tse di latelang ka go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe, tse di tsewang di sa nepagala?","The correct answer is **C: Mongwe le mongwe yo o itekanetseng, a ka kgona go itumelela se.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Malapa a a nang le bana ba ba nnye a ka tlhoka dipaakanyo tse di oketsegileng, mme go nna letsatsi kwa ntle go kgonega motlhofo le e leng ka masea le bana ba khereche.""  This implies that *everyone* can enjoy going for walks in nature, with adjustments as needed.  The core message is about accessibility and enjoyment for all individuals, regardless of age or circumstance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga go tlhoke gore motho a ipaakanye thata go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe:** While the passage says you don't have to *try* too hard, it doesn't say it's *not* challenging *at all*.  It acknowledges different levels of difficulty.
* **B: Dikgala di a farologana, mme ke tse di ka dirwang mo letsatsing le le lengwe:**  The passage mentions that the activities can vary, but the focus is not on the variety of *activities* but on the *accessibility* of the overall experience.
* **D: Go palama dithaba go tlhoka dipaakanyo tse di oketsegileng mo malapeng a a nang le bana ba bannye:**  The passage says families *might* need adjustments, not that it *always* requires extensive modifications.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke neng mo go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe go sa tlhokeng gore motho a ipaakanye thata?","The correct answer is **B: Fa go dirisiwa tsela e e bonolo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe, ga go tlhoke gore motho a ipaakanye thata, ebile mongwe le mongwe a ka kgona a itumelela se."" This translates to ""Going for a walk in the mountains on a day like this doesn't require a lot of effort, and everyone can enjoy it.""  ""Go dirisiwa tsela e e bonolo"" (using an easy way) is the closest paraphrase of this idea.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fa mopagami a itekanetse mo mmeleng** (When the person is in good shape): While fitness helps, the text emphasizes that it's *not required* to enjoy a mountain walk.
* **C: Fa bana ba ya go haeka** (When the children go to play): This is a specific scenario mentioned for families with young children and doesn't represent the general point of the text.
* **D: Fa go pagama dithaba go akaretsa go tsamaya mo ditikologong tsa tlhago** (When going for a mountain walk includes being in a natural environment): This is true, but it's not the reason why it doesn't require a lot of effort. The easy nature of the walk is the key point.



"
Ke eng se se farologaneng ka mafelo a a lekalekanang kwa Rogaland le Agder fa go bapiswa le Norway yotlhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Di nna di apesitswe ke ditlhatshana (They are marked by glaciers)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Kwa Rogaland le Agder ka ga ntsi di bidiwa """"hei"""" mo go rayang lefelo le le se nang ditlhare le le nnang le apesitswe ke ditlhatshana.""  This translates to: ""In Rogaland and Agder, they are often called ""hei"" which indicates a place with glaciers and marked by them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di na le ditlhare (They have glaciers):** While glaciers are mentioned, the text doesn't say all fells in Rogaland and Agder have glaciers.  It says they are *marked by* glaciers.
* **B: Ga go na dinkana tse di fa gare ga dithaba (There are no fells with mountains behind them):** The text explicitly says that fells are *behind* the mountains.
* **C: Gantsi ke mafelo a a lekalekanang (They are mostly fells):** The text doesn't directly state that they are ""mostly fells"" compared to the rest of Norway. It simply describes what fells are in general.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka se tlwaelesegeng ko Norway?","The correct answer is **C: Dinokana tse di fa gare ga dithaba**.

The text explicitly states: ""Selo se se tlwaelesegileng ko Norway ke **dinokana tse di fa gare ga dithaba**..."" which translates to ""A common sight in Norway is **rocks under the mountains**..."".

While the other options are *found* in Norway (vidde are open areas with rocks, hei are rocky areas), the text specifically identifies rocks under mountains as a *common* or *usual* sight. Therefore, it's the most directly stated ""normal"" feature.
"
Bajanala ba ba kgatlhegelang go relela ba tshwanetse go etela lefelo la dithaba neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka paka e bojanala bo tlhatlogang**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the ski resorts are located in areas that are ""bojanala"" (snowy) because they are affected by the Indian winter.
* It also mentions that the resorts offer activities similar to skiing and snowboarding. 
* Option B directly reflects this information.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka mariga** - While the passage mentions the resorts are at high altitudes (mariga), it doesn't specify it as the *place* to go.
* **C: Ka selemo sa se-India** - This refers to the cause of the snow, not the location.
* **D: Ka dikgakologo** - This word doesn't fit the context of ski resorts.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke neng fa gantsi go nang le bajanala ba bantsi go gaisa kwa lefelong la dithaba?","The correct answer is **A: Ka nako ya sefako se se itekanetseng**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Paka ya bojanala kwa dithabeng, ga ntsi e tlhatloga ka selemo sa se-India. Go tswa go le jalo, bana le bontle jo bo sa tshwaneng le go kgatlhisa ka mariga..."" (Ski resorts are popular because they are open during the Indian summer... This allows for beautiful children and a breathtaking view, offering activities similar to skiing and snowboarding.)
* **This implies:**  The popularity of these resorts is directly linked to the Indian summer, which is the time when people can enjoy the activities. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka paka yotlhe ya go tshamekela mo kapokong:** This is too broad. The passage doesn't say resorts are always open year-round.
* **C: Ka selemo sa se-India:** While the resort *opens* during the Indian summer, the passage implies the *activity* is most enjoyable *during* that time, not just the season itself.
* **D: Mo dikgweding tsotlhe tsa mariga:** The passage focuses on the Indian summer and the activities it enables, not all of March.



"
O tshwanetse o efoge go dira eng fa o solofela go bona sekepe se batla thuso?,"The correct answer is **C: Go bapatsa ditirelo** (To offer services).

Here's why:

The prompt describes a situation where you are trying to help people find the right boat. You need to:

* **Engage with people:** Talk to many people to understand their needs.
* **Offer assistance:** Help them find the right boat and provide them with information.
* **Show enthusiasm:**  Encourage them and highlight the boats available.

Offering services directly relates to providing assistance and help, which is the core of the scenario.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: O tsamaya mo maemakepeng (You walk around the docks):**  Walking around is part of the process, but not the key action when someone asks for help.
* **B: Go tsalana le batsamaisasekepe (To talk to boat operators):** While talking to boat operators is helpful, the primary focus is on helping the *people* looking for boats.
* **D: Go itlhokomolosa batho ba ba kopang go pegiwa mo dikepeng (To be attentive to people who are about to be boarded):** Attentiveness is important, but not the main action related to offering help.



Therefore, **C** best describes the action you should take after promising to help someone find a boat - to *offer services* or directly help them.

O tshwanetse go dira eng kwa maemelong dikepe fa o batlana le sekepe se se tlhokang thuso?,"The correct answer is **A: O golagana le batsamaisadikepe (You should talk to the boat operators)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of interacting with people in the docking areas to spread the word about the boat you're looking for. Specifically, it mentions talking to boat operators (""leka go golagana le batsamaisasekepe mo bareng"").  This is the most direct way to reach people who can help connect you with the boat you need.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Se bonagale (It shows itself):**  The passage explicitly states that boats don't just appear. You need to actively seek them out.
* **C: Bua le batho fela fa ba phephafatsa dikepe tsa bone (Talk only to people who promote their boats):** While talking to boat owners is helpful, the passage encourages talking to *many* people in the docking area.
* **D: Ikgatholose batho ba ba kopang go pegiwa mo dikepeng (Introduce people who are being put on boats):** This is a very narrow focus and doesn't cover the broader goal of finding a boat in need of help.



"
Ke lefelo lefe le le ka ngokang mojanala yo a nang le kgatlhego mo ditsong tsa sekolone tsa lefatshe le?,"The correct answer is **B: The Kowloon waterfront**.

The text specifically states: ""Fa o batla go bona ditso tsa sekolone tsa lefatshe le, o ka simolola gone fa. **The Kowloon waterfront**."" which translates to ""If you want to see the remnants of the colonial past, you can start there.""
"
"Ke lefelo lefe le le ka gogelang mojanala yo o bayang kwa pele, go bona dilo tse dintle?","The correct answer is **C: Setlhaketlhake sa Hong Kong**.

The passage states: ""Setlhakakatlhakeng sa Hong Kong ke sone se se fang kgaolo ya Hong Kong leina la yone, e bile ke lefelo le bajanala ba le kayang jaaka la kgogelo."" (The Hong Kong skyline is what gives Hong Kong its name and is a beloved place of inspiration.)  It then goes on to describe seeing Hong Kong well *from* the skyline.
"
"Ke eng seo disale tse dingwe di nang le sone, tse di thusang go fokotsa matshwenyego a pabalesego, a lenao la mopagami le ganeletse mo madulong a pitse?","The correct answer is **B: Dinakana tse di babalesegileng (Protective scales)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Madulo a pitse, segolo jang a modiro wa kwa ga Mmamosadinyana, a na le dinakana tse di babalesegileng tse motho o ka itshwareleleng ka tsone go letla fa maoto a tsenang teng go wela fatshe fa go gogelwa morago ke mopalami fa a wa.""  This directly links the protective scales to reducing the risk of injury when the bird lands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sola e e motsu (A flexible mesh):** While flexible mesh is used, the passage focuses on the *scales* as the primary protective feature within the nest.
*   **C: Fa maoto a tsenang teng (Where the feet enter):** This describes a location, not a protective feature.
*   **D: Di tshegetsa mopagami (They support the bird):** This is a general function of a nest, not a specific feature for reducing injury.



"
"Ke eng se se leng mo setlhakong se se faphegileng, se se thusang go oketsa pabalesego ya mopagami fa a dirisa sale ya pitse?","The correct answer is **A: Sola e e makgwakgwa, e e motsu**.

The text specifically mentions that many pilots use special attachments that have a ""pale filter that is round and made of metal."" This filter is designed to help prevent the propeller from hitting the ground if it's lowered too far. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Letlalo (Handle):** While a handle is part of the plane, it doesn't directly contribute to propeller safety in this context.
* **C: Serethe (Filter):** The text mentions a filter, but it describes it as a round *pale* filter made of metal, not just a general filter.
* **D: Sola e e sephara (Separate filter):** The text states pilots use attachments *with* a filter, not a separate one.



"
Ke eng se go tweng se ka newa bajanala ka Maharathatha a bojanala?,"The correct answer is **D: Kgolagano le bajanala ba bangwe ba ba etelang lefelo le le lengwe.**

Here's why:

* The passage describes Couchsurfing as a platform where travelers can connect with locals and stay in their homes for free.  The key aspect is *connection* and *sharing experiences* with other travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Mafelo a bonno le benggae:** While Couchsurfing might involve interactions with locals of different genders, the core concept isn't solely about gender.
* **B: Difofane tsa madi a a kwa tlase:**  The passage mentions ""money-saving"" as a reason people might use Couchsurfing, but it's not the *defining* characteristic.  The focus is on the cultural exchange and connection.
* **C: Bakaedi ba selegae ba maeto ba neelana ka maeto a bojanala:** While some travelers might offer free stays, the passage emphasizes the broader concept of cultural exchange and friendship.  It isn't just about offering a place to sleep.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang tebang le Mafaratlhatlha a bojanala, tse e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Bajanala ba tla neelwa mekwalo ya pampiri kgotsa e e mo mafaratlhatlheng a enthanete, ya baamogelabaeng ba ba tla bong ba le teng.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Go tswa foo, bajanala ba neelwa mekwalo ya pampiri kgotsa e mo mafaratlhatlheng a enthanete, fa gongwe e patilwe ke bopaki kwa bajanala ba bangwe."" This means they were given paper cards or online links, potentially with proof from other travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bajanala, ka gale, ba neelwa bopaki ka benggae:** The text doesn't say they were *generally* given proof from other travelers. It implies proof *could* be provided.
* **B: Mekgatlho e mengwe e ka nne ya tlhoka gore o netefatse itshupo ya gago go feta foo:** The text says *some* organizations *might* require verification of your profile *beyond* the initial setup.  This is not a direct statement about the process described.
* **D: Bopaki ka batho ba selegae, ka dinako dingwe, bo nna gone go bajanala:** This is incorrect. The text says proof could come from *other travelers*, not local people (selegae) being travelers themselves.



Therefore, only option C is directly supported by the information in the text."
"Go ya ka temana,ke mofuta ofe wa mojanala yo a ka se bonweng mo ntlong ya hosetele, e e kopanetsweng?","The correct answer is **C: Mojanala yo a tsamayang le bana ba bannye (A toddler who travels with other children)**.

Here's why:

* The prompt states that many of the people in the hostels are young men between the ages of 20 and 40.
* It also mentions that there are many children living in the hostels.
* The phrase ""Malapa a a nang le bana a ga a tlwaelesega"" (Families with children are unusual) suggests that children are present but not necessarily with their parents in a traditional family structure.
* The question asks about a toddler likely to be seen in the hostel.

Therefore, a toddler traveling with other children fits the described situation best.  The other options are less likely:

* **A: Mojanala yo o mo dingwageng tsa bomasome a mabedi (A toddler who is in their twenties):** This is contradictory.
* **B: Mojanala yo a tsamayang a le esi (A toddler who travels alone):** While possible, the prompt implies children are often found *with* others.
* **D: Mojanala yo o mo dingwageng tsa gagwe tsa bo masome a mararo (A toddler who is in their thirties):** This is also contradictory.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo, gantsi, a ka nnang kwa hoseteleng?","The correct answer is **B: Batho ba bararo ba dingwaga di le 22 ba tsamaya mmogo.**

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states that the hostels are mostly occupied by men aged 20 to 40, and there are many young women who come to work there.  It also mentions that families are uncommon, and there are other hostels where people can be robbed.
* **Q (the question)** asks who is *often* found in the hostel according to the passage.
* **Option B** directly reflects the passage's description of men aged 20-40 being prevalent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While some young people might be with a partner, the passage emphasizes the age range of the men in the hostels.
* **C:** People in their 70s are outside the described age range.
* **D:** The passage states that families are *uncommon*.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang e e tlhalosang ka nepagalo, go latlhela boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: Ka metlha, e tsile go boela ko letsogong la gago, fa o e konopile sentle.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Go latlhela Boomerang ke bokgoni jo bo rategang jo baeti ba le bantsi ba ka ratang go nna le jone."" (Throwing a boomerang is a skill that many visitors might like to learn.)
* **The passage also says:** ""Ka metlha, e tsile go boela ko letsogong la gago, fa o e konopile sentle."" (Normally, it returns to your hand if you throw it correctly.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E ratiwa thata ke benggae go feta bajanala:** The passage doesn't mention anything about gender preferences.
* **C: Ga go na dibumaring tse di leng gone mo Australia:** The passage explicitly states that most boomerangs in Australia *don't* return.
* **D: Ke dibumaring di se kae fela, tse di kgonang go bowa:** The passage focuses on the boomerang's ability to *return* and doesn't mention it flying off in all directions.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e dirisiwang thata mo dijong tsa batho ba Java?","The correct answer is **C: Sukiri e e dirilweng ka khokhonate (Coconut sugar)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...Java foods include many ingredients that are not suitable for consumption by children, such as palm sugar (gula jawa), dates, sugar (including coconut sugar from Java) and various other syrups that are made from palm nectar.""  Therefore, coconut sugar is listed as one of the ingredients not suitable for children.
"
"Go ya ka temana , bolwetse jo bo tshelanwang, bo fetela jang?","The correct answer is **B: Ditshidinyana (Pathogens)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bolwetse jo bo tshelanwang bo bakiwa ke ditshidinyana jaaka megare, mothuthuntshwane kgotsa megare e mengwe.""  This translates to ""Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or other parasites."" 

Therefore, the passage explicitly links infectious diseases to pathogens. The other options are incorrect.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se go itseweng se ka se bake bolwetsi jo bo tshwaetsanang?","The correct answer is **B: Megare (Viruses)**.

The text states: ""Bolwetse jo bo tshelanwang bo bakiwa ke ditshidinyana jaaka megare, mothuthuntshwane kgotsa megare e mengwe."" This translates to: ""Contagious diseases are caused by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, or other parasites.""

Therefore, the answer is **Megare (Viruses)**.
"
"Ke mo maemong afe a go tlhopha kemedi ya webo go na le VPN e e sa tlhakanelwang, go lekanenetse modirisi?","The correct answer is **B: Modirisi o batla go tila dikganelelo tse di bewang mapolotiki le bagwebi ba ba lekang go bona gore motho yo o dirisang enthanete a bo a le kae, ka fa go kgonegang ka teng.**

Here's why:

* **The initial text states that VPNs are superior to web proxies because they can encrypt *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP.**  This is a key difference.
* **The question asks when a web proxy is sufficient.** The text implies that web proxies are *not* sufficient when the user's goal is to circumvent political censorship and hide their location from websites.  This requires the broader encryption offered by VPNs.
* **Option B directly reflects this need for censorship circumvention and location masking.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Modirisi o batla go kaela pharakano go sele** - While a web proxy can encrypt traffic, option B is a more encompassing reason.  Simple encryption isn't *just* about concealing traffic; it's often about concealing the *origin* of the traffic.
* **C: Modirisi o kaela go sele,pharakano yotlhe ya http** -  This is partially true about web proxies, but the text emphasizes that VPNs are better for *all* traffic, including HTTPS.
* **D: Di neelana ka makhubu a a kwa godimo le tirelo** -  This describes a characteristic of *some* proxies, but it doesn't define *why* someone might choose a web proxy over a VPN.

Therefore, option B is the only one that correctly identifies the scenario where a web proxy might be adequate – when the user's primary goal is simply to encrypt their traffic, but not necessarily to hide their location from sophisticated tracking or bypass strict censorship.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang ka di- VPN le dikemedi tsa webo, e e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Di-VPN gantsi di neelana ka makhubu a a kwa godimo go na le dikemedi tsa webo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gantsi di neelana ka makhubu a a kwa godimo le tirelo ya boleng jo bo botoka."" (They often provide overhead and a fast connection.)  This directly contradicts option A. VPNs generally use encryption to protect all internet traffic, not just HTTP.

Let's break down why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Dikemedi tsa webo di ka se kgone go kaela go sele,pharakano yotlhe ya inthanete:**  The passage states VPNs can encrypt all internet traffic, not just HTTP. This implies web proxies don't have that capability.
* **C: Dikemedi tsa webo ke tsa boleng jo bo kwa tlase, go bapisiwa le di-VPN:** The passage explicitly says VPNs offer better security and a faster connection than web proxies.
* **D: Di-VPN di kgona fela go kaela gosele, pharakano ya http:** The passage states VPNs protect *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP.



Therefore, the only false statement among the options is A."
Ke eng seo se letlang mongwe go dirisa mogala wa setlamo kwa ntle ga fa ba nnang?,"The correct answer is **A: Megala e e mo mafaratlhatlheng a inthanete**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka gore megala e mo maharathatheng a enthanete, ga go tlhokege go re o dirise mogala wa setlamo sa kwa o nnang teng kgotsa kwa o etelang teng."" (In internet phone systems, you don't need to use a landline from where you are or where you are going.)

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the passage emphasizes the independence of internet phone systems from traditional landline infrastructure.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se o tlhokang gore se diriwe gore o emetswe ke dinomoro tse di rileng?","The correct answer is **A: Reka nomore ya lefatshe lotlhe (Buy a global number)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Gantsi, o tshwanelwa ke go reka nomore ya lefatshe lotlhe kwa thoko e e letlang go re megala PSTN e go leletse."" (Often, you have to buy a global number because PSTN phones are limited.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dirisa mogala wa setlamo sa kwa o nnang teng (Use a local number):** The text says you don't *have* to use a local number.
* **C: Bona nomoro ya selegae (Find a local phone number):**  The text says a local phone number isn't necessary, and you can have a number in one place and use it in another.
* **D: Reka mogala wa PSTN (Buy a PSTN phone):** The text implies PSTN phones are limiting and you need a global number instead.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo, go bitsa mafoko a se-Italy?","The correct answer is **D: Go bitsa bontsi ba mafoko go farologana go ya ka gore di salwa morago ke tlhaka efe** (Translates to: ""Calling many words differently depends on which letter is left over"").

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Go bitsa mafoko a se-Italy go motlhofo ka go re bontsi jwa mafoko a bitswa fela ka fa a kwadilweng ka teng."" (Calling Italian words is tricky because many words are only pronounced based on how they're written.)
* **The passage explains:** The importance of 'c' and 'g' because they're often silent and the difference between 'r' and 'rr'. 
* **Option D contradicts this:** The passage doesn't say that pronunciation differences *depend* on which letter is left over. It implies that the *presence* of certain letters (like 'c' and 'g') can affect pronunciation, but the overall pattern isn't simply about what's left over.

Let's look at why the other options are *not* the answer:

* **A: Di r tse pedi , di bidiwa ka tsela e e farologaneng le r a le mongwe** (Translates to: ""Two 'r's, are called differently, and 'r' is one."") This is *supported* by the passage's explanation of 'r' vs 'rr'.
* **B: Bontsi jwa mafoko a bitswa fela ka fa a kwadilweng** (Translates to: ""Many words are only pronounced based on how they are written."") This is *directly stated* in the first sentence of the passage.
* **C: Mafoko a ditlhaka c le g a ka go tsietsa** (Translates to: ""Words with letters c and g can be tricky."") This is *supported* by the passage's mention of 'c' and 'g' being silent.



Therefore, Option D is the only statement that doesn't accurately reflect the information provided in the passage.



"
Ke dife tsa dibopego tsa Izmir tse di simolotseng pele ga bošeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Mafaratlhatlhatlha a matona (Historical monuments)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mafaratlhatlhatlha a matona, dikago tsa galase ka fa pele..."" which translates to ""Historical monuments, followed by glass houses..."". The passage then goes on to list other features, but historical monuments are mentioned first as a key characteristic of Izmir.
"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang se e seng sebopego se se nepagetseng sa Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Go na le seemo le dipopego tse di tlwaelegileng tsa Turkey**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Izmir has ""seemo le ditebego tsa Yuropa ya Mediterranean go na le tse di tlwaelegileng tsa Turkey"" which translates to ""It has common European Mediterranean customs and traditions of Turkey"". This means it *does* have common Turkish customs and traditions.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the text:

*   **A: Toropo e ikadile go dikologa kgogometso** - The text states ""E dikologilwe ke dithaba"" (It is surrounded by mountains), implying it's isolated from major transportation routes.
*   **C: O ka bona marekisetso a segompieno le mafelo a thapelo le dikereke** - The text mentions ""marekisetso a segompieno a kgabisitswe ka marulelo a dithaele tse di khibidu, dikago tsa galase ka fa pele le mafelo a thapelo le dikereke"" (modern markets are enhanced by modern glass buildings and modern markets, glass buildings and places of worship and churches).
*   **D: E na le boemakepe jwa bobedi ka bogolo** - The text says ""E na le boemakepe jwa bobedi ka bogolo"" (It has the second largest population).



"
"Lefoko, hanami, le kaya go bogela eng?","The correct answer is **A: Dithunya tsa ditšheri (Cherry blossoms)**.

The passage states: ""Go bogelwa ga dithunya tsa Cherry...ga go bolo go nna karolo ya setso sa Japane go tloga ka lekgolo la bo-8 la dingwaga."" (The tradition of cherry blossom viewing...has not been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.) and ""Kakanyo ya teng e ne e tswa kwa China kwa dithunya tsa leungo la polamo e leng lelomo le le rategang."" (The custom originated in China with the viewing of flowering plum trees.)

Therefore, the question asks what ""hanami"" refers to, and the passage clearly indicates it's about viewing **cherry blossoms**.
"
Ke mang a neng a tshware meletlo ya ntlha ya go bogela dithunya tsa ditšheri?,"The correct answer is **C: Kgosikgolo ya Japane**.

The passage states: ""Kwa Japane, meletlo ya ntlha ya dithunya tsa dicheri e ne e tshwarela **kgosikgolo**; a o tshwarela ene le maloko a mangwe a bogosi, gaufi le Kgotla ya Bogosi."" (In Japan, the original cherry blossom festival was presided over by the **Emperor**; he presided over it along with other royal families, near the Imperial Palace.)
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dintlha tse di latelang tsa Jerusalem tse di ka nneng di a se ngoke bojanala?","The correct answer is **A: Botlhokwa jwa toropokgolo e mo tumelong**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states, ""Jerusalem e boitshepho mo ditumelo tsa Judaism, Christianity le Islam e bile ke lefelo la tumelo, le tsa setso."" (Jerusalem is a shrine in the faiths of Judaism, Christianity and Islam and is a place of faith, and of the people.) This highlights its religious significance.
* While options B, C, and D are all true statements about Jerusalem, they are not as central or emphasized as its religious importance in the provided text. The text dedicates the most space and detail to explaining Jerusalem's religious significance.

Therefore, the text emphasizes its religious importance above all else, making option A the most accurate reflection of what the text highlights as a reason for its enduring appeal.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang jaaka se Jerusalem e itsegeng ka sone?","The correct answer is **B: Tlhotlheletso ya sepolotiki (Political turmoil)**.

Here's why:

* The passage focuses on Jerusalem's historical and religious significance. It mentions its status as a holy city for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, its ancient history, and its role as a major tourist destination. It also describes the city's cultural attractions and offerings.
* While the passage *implies* there might have been conflict due to its religious importance (""segolobogolo mo mafelong a mantsi a kgale a Old City""), it doesn't explicitly discuss or emphasize ""political turmoil"" as a defining characteristic of the city. 
* The other options *are* explicitly mentioned in the passage:
    * **Ditso tse di kgatlhisang (Ancient historical sites):**  ""Toropokgolo ya bogologolo ya Judean Hills e na le ditso tse di kgatlhisang tsa dingwaga tse di diketekete.""
    * **Botlhokwa jwa tumelo (Importance of faith):** ""E bile ke lefelo la tumelo, le tsa setso."" and ""Ke nngwe ya konokono ya mafelo a bojanala kwa Israel.""
    * **Mafelo a tsa ditso (Cultural attractions):** ""Jerusalem e na le mafelo a ditso, dikago tsa bogologolo le tsa ditso...""

Therefore, ""Tlhotlheletso ya sepolotiki"" is the option that is *least* directly described or emphasized in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mothale ofe wa mojanala yo a ka se ungwelweng ke go reka Wild Card?","The correct answer is **A: Motho yo o ikaelelang go etela diSANPark ka bontsi jo bo kgonegang** (Someone who plans to visit SANParks frequently).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that a Wild Card is beneficial for those who plan to visit *multiple* protected areas in South Africa. 
* Option A aligns with this by suggesting frequent visits to SANParks.
* Options B, C, and D are too narrow. Wild Cards are not primarily for single visits or those solely concerned about cost. They are designed to provide value for repeated access to various parks.



"
"Ke efe polelo e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo,Kruger National Park?","The correct answer is **B: Diphologolo di farologana magareng ga dikarolo tse dintsi tsa phaka** (The reserves are spread among the many sections of the park).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kgaogantswe ka dikarolwana di le 14, nngwe le nngwe e tshegetsa diphologolo ka go farologana."" (It is divided into 14 sections, each supporting wildlife widely).  This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E tsewa jaaka e e kgatlhisang e tona mo Aforika Borwa** (It is known as the largest wildlife reserve in South Africa): While Kruger is a large reserve, the passage doesn't state that it's *the largest*. It only mentions its area.
* **C: Ke e nnye thata mo diphakeng tsa bosetšhaba tsa Aforika Borwa** (It is the most difficult of the national parks in South Africa): The passage gives no information about the difficulty of accessing Kruger.
* **D: Baeng ba kgona go e fitlhelela ka go reka Wild Card** (Visitors can access it by buying a Wild Card):  The passage *does* mention Wild Cards, but it frames it as an *alternative* way to access parks, not a defining characteristic of Kruger itself.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e ka nnang kotsi thata go bapagami go ralala dikarolo tse di motlhatlogo thata?","The correct answer is **D: Megala ya tshipi**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...dikarolong tse di tlhatlogelelang thata tsa megala ya tshipi di neelana ka tshegetso ya matshwaro a diatla."" (The most difficult parts of the stone stairs were reinforced with iron supports.)
* **It further warns:** ""segolobogolo jang fa go le metsi, e re ka go ka nnang kotsi ka bonako."" (especially if it's wet, as it can be very dangerous.)
* **The other options are less directly linked to the danger of slipping:**
    * **A: Maemo a a bongola (The weather conditions):** While weather *can* make the stairs slippery, the text focuses on the inherent danger of the stone stairs themselves.
    * **B: Mantswe a go gatiwang mo go one (The words written along the way):**  These provide information, not a physical danger.
    * **C: Logaga lo lo nnye (The nearby ledge):** This is a feature to be aware of, but not the primary danger of slipping on the stairs.

Therefore, the **megala ya tshipi (stone stairs)**, especially when wet, are presented as the most significant risk of slipping.



"
"Ke dife tsa dipolelo tseno, tse di sa bontsheng ka nepagalo, go ya kwa godimo ga thaba ya Machu Picchu jaaka di tlhalositswe mo temaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Le bapagami ba ba itekanetseng tota, ba ka nne ba felelwa ke mowa.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Solofela go felelwa ke mowa, mme o itlhokomele mo dikarolong tse di motlhatlogo thata, segolobogolo jang fa go le metsi, e re ka go ka nna kotsi ka bonako."" This indicates that people who are physically able can reach the top, and the experience is somewhat spiritual. Option A captures this idea of accessible people reaching the top with a spiritual element.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ga go na tshegetso ya matshwaro a diatla go ralala dikarolo tse di motlhatlogo thata:** The text says the difficult sections have supports made of stone.
* **C: O tshwanetse go feta mo logageng kwa setlhoeng se o tshwanetse ka sone:** The text says you *should* pass near a small cave near the top, not necessarily *over* it.
* **D: Dikarolo tse di motlhatlogo di nna kotsi fa go le metsi:** While the text mentions danger if it rains, it doesn't say the difficult sections are inherently dangerous when wet. It specifically mentions rain as a risk.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tsone e e sa itsegeng ka dijo tse di ratwang thata tsa Ma-Jorca?","The correct answer is **A: Nama**.

The text states that traditional Majorcan dishes consist of ""borotho, merogo le nama"" (meat, vegetables, and meat), but then specifically highlights the *pa amb oli* as a favorite dish of meat, olive oil, tomatoes, and sometimes cheese or snails. This implies that meat isn't a defining ingredient of the *favorite* hearty dishes in the same way the other options (vegetables and snails) are.

Therefore, based on the context, meat is the answer.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso mo temaneng, ke polelo efe ka dijo tsa hangi, e e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Dijo tsa Hangi, go dirisiwa maje a molelo, e gone kwa Wellington**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Khuti e gotediwa ka maje a molelo a a tswang mo molelong... fa hangi e nngwe e ka lekelediwa mo Christchurch, Wellington le kwa mafelong a mangwe.""  This means Hangi is found in several places including Christchurch and Rotorua, not *only* Wellington.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** This is a summary of the passage and generally accurate.
*   **C:** The passage explicitly says Hangi is often used to serve traditional Maori foods.
*   **D:** The passage states Hangi is found in Rotorua.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang jaaka tsela e e tlwaelesegileng ya go gotetsa khuti ya hangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Gase**.

Here's why:

The passage states that hangi is traditionally cooked using hot stones (maje a molelo) heated by geothermal activity (mafelo a a pumpunyegang ka mogote). It also mentions that sometimes other boiling springs are used.  The passage *doesn't* mention using gas to cook hangi.
"
Ke eng se se ka dirang gore o lemogiwe ke monna wa phuthego kgotsa mosadi wa phuthego ka tsela e e kgethegileng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go rwala serwalo sa mebala e e phatsimang**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bontsi jwa mafelo a kobamelo a neela basadi ba ba tlang basa ipaakanya dirwalo, fela fa otla ka sa gago, segolothata sa mebala e e phatshimang, wa go bona monyenyoo gotswa go banna mo phuthegong kgotsa basadi ba phuthego kwa kgorong.""  This directly links wearing brightly colored clothing to attracting unwanted attention from men or women in the community.

The other options are either:

* **B: Go bipa magetla a gago:**  Mentioned in the passage but not specifically tied to attracting unwanted attention.
* **C: Mafelo a kobamelo a neela basadi ba ba tlang ba sa ipaakanya dirwalo:** This describes a practice, not a specific action that attracts unwanted attention.
* **D: Go apara mesese e e fetang mangole:**  This is mentioned as a way for men to avoid being noticed, not for attracting attention.



"
Ke efe ya diaparo tse di latelang e e ka nneng ya se nne gone go adima mo mafelong a kobamelo? ,"The correct answer is **C: Marokgwe**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mo kgannyeng yone eo, banna ba tshwanetse go apara marokgwe a a thibetsang mangole."" (In that section, men should wear trousers that cover their genitals.)

Therefore, trousers (marokgwe) are the appropriate clothing to wear in places of worship, according to the text.
"
Moeng a ka nna le ditšhono tse dintsi neng go itumelela dinaledi fa a etetse mafelo a kwa Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka dikgwedi tsa selemo** (Throughout the year).

Here's why:

The passage states that you can see the Aurora Australis (Southern Lights) throughout the year in Antarctica. The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fa mafelo a se na baagi ba bantsi** (When there are few people): While true that Antarctica has few people, this isn't the *reason* you can see the lights throughout the year.
* **C: Ka mariga** (In March): The passage says you can go in March, but doesn't limit the aurora viewing to just that month.
* **D: Kgotlelego e le kwa tlase** (Low altitude): Low altitude is irrelevant to seeing the aurora.
"
Ke neng foo mogala wa sethelaete o ka se kgoneng go emisetsa mogala wa letheka?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa o tla tshwanela ke gore o bo o le kwa ntle ka mogala.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mogala wa sathalaete tota ga o emisetse mogala wa letheka, ka o tla tshwanelwa ke go re o bo o le kwa ntle ka mogala o o bonalang sentle kwa sathalaeteng go re o letse mogala."" This translates to: ""A satellite network does not replace a terrestrial network; you will need to be outside where you can see the satellite to get a signal.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa mogala o o bonalang sentle kwa sethelaeteng o ka nne wa kgoreletsega:** While a clear view is *required*, the fact that it might be obstructed doesn't explain *why* the satellite can't replace a terrestrial network.
*   **B: Fa lefelo le le kwa tennyana-teng:** The remoteness of the location is a factor that *makes* satellite communication a solution, but not the *reason* it can't replace terrestrial networks.
*   **D: Fa ba matsholo ba na le ditlhokego tsa tshedimosetso e kgakala:** The need for secure communications is a *reason* for using satellite networks, but not the reason they can't replace terrestrial ones.



"
Ke neng foo mogala wa sethelaete e ka nnang one o dirisiwang go na le mogala wa selula?,"The correct answer is **B: Mo loetong ka mokoro** (In a boat).

Here's why:

The text states that satellite phones are useful in areas where there's no cellular signal. A boat is a common place to be far from cellular towers, making option B the most logical choice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa o ijesa monate mo toropokgolong** (When prospecting for minerals in a town):  While it *could* be used, it's not the primary reason stated in the text. The text emphasizes lack of cellular service.
*   **C: Fa tshedimosetso e kgakala e sa tlhokege** (When confidentiality is not required): The text highlights satellite phones for those needing secure communications.
*   **D: Fa o ka nneng wa kgona go dirisa maranyane a mogala wa cellular a a lekaneng** (When you could use a sufficient amount of cellular signal): This directly contradicts the text's premise that satellite phones are used *because* there's no cellular signal.



"
"Kgotlhang ka efe ya tse di latelang, e tlhodile boikemelo jwa Transnistria Republic?","The correct answer is **A: Tsa itsholelo (Secession)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ka ngwaga wa 1994, kgotlhang e e tlhodile boikemelo jwa Transinistria Republic..."" which translates to ""In 1994, secession led to the independence of Transnistria Republic...""

Therefore, the secession is what triggered the independence of Transnistria.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang,e Transnistria Republic e nang le yone, e e farologaneng le Moldova yotlhe?  ","The correct answer is **D: Madi a naga ya teng** (State funds).

The text explicitly states: ""kwa go nang le puso e e leng ya yona le **madi a naga ya teng**, mme fela ga tlhomamisiwa ke leloko lepe la UN."" This means Transnistria Republic had its own government and its own state funds.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Puo** (Language): While language is a factor, the text doesn't specifically highlight it as a defining characteristic that separates Transnistria.
*   **B: Tumelo** (Religion): The text states the dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity. It doesn't mention a specific religion in Transnistria.
*   **C: Go tlhomamisiwa ke UN** (Recognition by the UN): The text says it was only recognized by one UN member state, indicating it *didn't* have widespread UN recognition."
"Go ya ka temana, ke neng fa moeti a ka etelang Montevideo fa a solofela go tila maemo a phefo e e fokang?","The correct answer is **A: Ka dikgwedi tsa mariga tsa Bokone jwa Hemisefere**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""E re ka Montevideo e le kwa borwa jwa Equator, go selemo koo fa e le mariga kwa Bokone jwa Hemisefere le ka go refosana jalo."" This translates to: ""Although Montevideo is south of the Equator, it can be cold there in March as it is March in the Northern Hemisphere and it can be similar. In Montevideo it is hot; during the months of the year, average temperatures are often above +30°C."" This indicates that March in the Northern Hemisphere is a time when Montevideo experiences cooler temperatures compared to other months.
"
"Go ya ka temana, moeti o tshwanetse go etela Montevideo neng fa ba kgatlhegela maemo a bosa a a tsiditsana?","The correct answer is **A: Fa e le selemo kwa Montevideo**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""E re ka Montevideo e le kwa borwa jwa Equator, go selemo koo fa e le mariga kwa Bokone jwa Hemisefere le ka go refosana jalo."" This translates to: ""It can be in Montevideo, in the Southern Hemisphere, that it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere and it can be like that.""
* The text then goes on to describe the typical weather in Montevideo during the year, mentioning that temperatures often exceed +30°C.
* Therefore, to experience the ""tsididi thata ka bolotsana"" (very intense heat) described, the best time to visit is during the year in Montevideo.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B:** The weather in the Northern Hemisphere doesn't directly dictate the weather in the Southern Hemisphere.
* **C:** The text says there aren't specific ""rain"" or ""storm"" seasons.
* **D:** While spring in the Northern Hemisphere coincides with autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, the description of intense heat applies to Montevideo *during the year*, not just during autumn.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke sefe sa tse di latelang, se se amanngwang le bataki ba mekwalokwalo ya mabota go na le tshenyo ya didiriswa tsa botlhe le tsa poraefete?","The correct answer is **C: Mokwalo le ditshwantsho tse di mo maboteng, tse di sa batliweng**.

Here's why:

* The passage defines graffiti as ""Mokwalo le ditshwantsho tse di mo maboteng, tse di sa batliweng"" (Writing and drawings on walls, that are not authorized).
* The question asks what is associated with graffiti that *does* involve unauthorized defacement.
* Option C directly refers to the definition of graffiti itself, which *implies* unauthorized defacement.
* Options A, B, and D are either specific aspects of graffiti (like markets or the concept of ""non-violent activism"") or descriptions of graffiti, but not the *core definition* of the unauthorized act that defines graffiti.



Therefore, the best answer is C because it represents the fundamental element of graffiti – unauthorized writing and drawings on walls."
Ke ntlha efe ya meletlo eo batho ba ba e tseneng ba tsayang e le botlhokwa thata mo moletlong oo?,"The correct answer is **A: Go na le bana ba bannye (There are other children)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bontsi jwa bone ba tsaya go dira jalo go le botlhokwa thata mo moletlong o o. Go batla o nna gaufi le ditiragalo go batla o tla nako e sale teng go re o kgone go bona lefelo la boroko gaufi le ko mmino o teng. Gopola go re le fa go tshameka mmino mo phatlalatseng go fedile, go na le kgonagalo ya go re dikarolo tse dingwe tsa maitiso tsa di tshameka mmino go fitlhelela bosigo thata. **Meletlo e na le dikampa tse di kgethegileng tsa malapa a go nang le bana ba ba nnye.**""

This paragraph links the difficulty of attending the concert to the fact that many people have other children and the concert has specific camping areas for families with young children. This implies that the presence of other children is a major factor making it difficult to enjoy the concert.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Meletlo e na le dikampa (The concert has camping areas):** While true, this is a *result* of the difficulty, not the *reason* for it.
* **C: Di tshameka mmino go fitlhelela bosigo thata (The music is hard to hear):** This is a potential consequence of the sound system not being optimal, but it's not the primary reason people find it difficult.
* **D: O tla nako e sa le teng (You will spend time not being there):**  This refers to the strategy of going to the concert to be closer to the action, it doesn't explain *why* it's difficult.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng seo motho yo o tsenelang meletlo a tshwanetseng go se dira pele fa a batla go nna gaufi le ditiragalo?","The correct answer is **D: O tla nako e sa le teng** (You should go at a time when the event is not happening).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Go batla o nna gaufi le ditiragalo go batla o tla nako e sale teng go re o kgone go bona lefelo la boroko gaufi le ko mmino o teng."" (To be close to the events, you should go at a time when you can see the stage and the music clearly.)  This means you need to go *before* the main event starts to get a good spot.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae moo go sa siamelang baeng fa ba batla go itlosa bodutu bosigo kwa bokone jwa New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Dibara tsa metsana e mennye (Small towns)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ela Tlhoko: dibara tsa ditoropo tse dinnye mono di kgona go sa nneng mafelo a a siametseng moeng o o tswang go sele. Se se le teng ke go re bokone jwa Mexico botshabelelwa ke go nna le bakgweetsi ba ba itshietseng nnotagi, bontsi ja bone ba le gaufi le dibara tsa metsana e mennye."" (Note: This is a translation of the sentence, but it conveys the meaning.)
* This translates to: ""Note: the small towns here are not necessarily reputable environments. What exists is the ability of Mexico's history to be accompanied by discreet gamblers, many of whom are close to small towns.""
* The passage also mentions casinos, but the main point is that *small towns* offer a more discreet and less ""reputable"" environment for gambling.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae moo moeng a ka nneng a bona mafelo a a itsegeng a maitiso mo bokone jwa New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: Kwa dikhasinong, gaufi le Sante Fe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...a bontsi ja mafelo a itloso boduto a di casino a a umakilweng fa godimo, a rekisa bojalwa; e bile mangwe mo go one a dirisa didirisiwa tsa maina a a tumileng go natefisa maitiso (bogolo jang mo go tse di tona tse di gaufi le Albuquerque le Santa Fe).""

This directly translates to: ""...many legalized casinos are located above, selling alcohol; and some of them use well-known games to satisfy customers (as big as those near Albuquerque and Santa Fe).""

Therefore, the passage indicates casinos near Santa Fe are a place where you can find legalized gambling.
"
Baeng ba ba se nang madi a mantsi ba ka batla go se nwe mofuta ofe wa nno?,"The correct answer is **B: Metsi a mo dibotlolong**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Metsi a pompo a mo lefelong a sireletsegile go ka a nwa, mme gone metsi a mo dibotlolong a motlhofo go bonwa fa e le go re o a tshaba."" This translates to: ""Tap water in the level is safe to drink, and bottled water is also seen as a precaution.""  Bottled water is generally cheaper than coffee or other specialty drinks.

The other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mofine wa kwa Australia:** Australian coffee, especially ""flat white,"" is described as unusual and potentially more expensive.
* **C: Bojalwa ba selegae:** The text mentions local specialties like ""Manta,"" but doesn't specify a price point.
* **D: Seno sa matute a maungo:** Belgian chocolate is described as delicious but not necessarily a budget option.



"
"Go ya ka lefelo le le tlhalositsweng mo temaneng, ke efe ya di otara tsa dino e e ka tlhakatlhakanyang batho ba ba tsamaisang dijo?","The correct answer is **A: espresso e ntsho**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mo bathong ba Australia, go nwa kofi e e tshetsweng mashi a lobese (e a tleng ”flat white”) ke selo se se sa tlwaelesegang. Bone ba nwa ”espresso” e ntsho e bile e sa tlala kopi."" This translates to ""In Australia, drinking coffee made with steamed milk (called a ""flat white"") is not common. They drink ""espresso"" which is a strong, concentrated coffee.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Number One:** This refers to a type of local honey.
* **C: Sauvignon Blanc go tswa New Zealand:** This is a type of wine from New Zealand.
* **D: kofi e e tshetsweng mashi a lobese:** While mentioned, the text says it's *not* common in Australia.



"
"Mokgwa wa go thopa, yo o neng wa tsaya lobaka lwa makgolo a mararo a dingwaga, o ne wa simolola ke setlhopha sefe sa batho?","The correct answer is **D: Ma-spain**.

The passage states: ""Ba-Spain ba ne ba simolola motlha wa go thopa o o neng wa tsaya lobaka lwa makgolo a le mararo a dingwaga."" (The Spanish started a wave of colonization that lasted for three long years.)
"
"Go ya ka temana,gore o kgone go tseega sentle fa o le kwa Paris, o tshwanetse o dire eng?","The correct answer is **C: Itshware sentle**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ma-Paris ba itsege ka go nna bohula, le go sa tlotleng ba bangwe, mmogo le go nna lenyatso. Le ntswa se gantsi e le kakanyetso e e sa lolamang, go re o kgone go tseega sentle fa o le ko Paris, go batla o itshwara sentle, ka maitsholo a ba a bitsang ”bien élevé” (go godisiwa sentle).""

This translates to: ""Parisians are known for being refined, not disrespectful to others, and being poised. It is often considered a requirement to succeed in Paris, to appear well-mannered, in a manner they call 'bien élevé' (well-bred).""

The passage directly links being well-mannered (""bien élevé"") to being able to ""tseega sentle"" (succeed/get along well) in Paris.  ""Itshware sentle"" means ""to behave well"" or ""to be well-mannered.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maiteko a go itshwara ka maitsholo a batho ba Paris:** While related, it's not the most concise or accurate answer.
*   **B: Go tlhagisa go itshepa thata:** This means ""to work hard to be independent,"" which isn't directly related to Parisian etiquette.
*   **D: Supa maitseo a mantle:** This means ""to offer valuable ideas,"" which is mentioned as a *result* of being well-mannered, not the core requirement.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa tseweng jaaka kakanyetso e e sa lolamang ka batho ba Paris?","The correct answer is **C: Go itshamekela (Being rude)**.

Here's why:

The text states that being ""bien élevé"" (well-mannered) in Paris is highly valued.  The passage explicitly lists ""go nna lenyatso"" (being rude) and ""go sa tlotle"" (not being polite) as things that are *not* tolerated and considered a bad impression. 

While being ""a tshosang"" (outgoing/lively) is *positive* and attracts attention, it's not presented as something frowned upon like rudeness or impoliteness. The passage focuses on the importance of proper etiquette.

Therefore, ""go itshamekela"" (being rude) is the *least* likely to be considered a positive attribute in Paris, and aligns with the passage's emphasis on proper manners.
"
Melemo ya Maemo a ntlha mo MetroRail ya Cape Town ke eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Letoroko le kwa pele ga terena (The first stop before the train)**.

The text states: ""A: MetroPlus a nna a le ko morago ga terena e e gaufi le Cape Town."" which translates to ""A: MetroPlus is the stop before the train closest to Cape Town."" This directly answers the question about the advantage of MetroPlus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ga e a tlala (It is not expensive):** While the text mentions MetroPlus is cheaper than regular European tickets, it doesn't state that it's *not expensive* in general.
* **C: E tlhwatlhwatlase go feta thekete ya Maemo a Boraro (It is cheaper than Metro tickets):** The text says MetroPlus is cheaper than *regular* European tickets, not necessarily cheaper than Metro tickets.
* **D: Ke tlhwatlhwa e e lekanang le ya thekete ya Metro (It is the same price as a Metro ticket):** This is incorrect as the text clearly indicates MetroPlus is cheaper.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se diterena tsotlhe tsa Cape Town di nang le sone?","The correct answer is **D: Letoroko la Maemo a Ntlha gammogo le a Boraro**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Diterena tsotlhe di na le matoroko a ka bobedi MetroPlus le Metro..."" which translates to ""All trains have both MetroPlus and Metro lines...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Letoroko la Metro le le sa tlalang** - The text mentions both MetroPlus *and* Metro lines, not just the Metro line.
* **B: Tlhwatlhwa e e tshwanang ya dithekete tsa mefuta ka bobedi** - While the ticket prices might be similar, the text doesn't focus on the ticket prices as a common feature.
* **C: Maemo a le mararo a a farologaneng** - The text only discusses two lines, not three.

Therefore, the only option that accurately reflects what all trains in Cape Town have, according to the text, is both the MetroPlus and Metro lines.



"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang se setshedi se ka nneng sa se se dire?,"The correct answer is **B: Malwetse a ilwang ke mmele**.

The passage states that bacteria can cause various illnesses, including ""malwetse a ilwang ke mmele"" (diseases that affect the body). The other options are also mentioned as potential consequences of bacteria, but illness is a more general and direct result.
"
Dikarata tsa prepaid tsa mesokelatsebeng di ka rekiwa kae?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo mabenkeleng a mannye**. 

The first sentence of the text states: ""Mabenkele otlhe a mannye a na le tlhakantshuke ya dikarata tsa pre-paid tsa mesokelatsebeng..."" which translates to ""All major banks have a stock of pre-paid phone cards...""
"
Dielo tse di sologelang molemo di neelana jang ka dikarata dingwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka dinomoro tsa mogala tse di sa duelelweng**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mgaa dikarata tse dintsi di siametse go ka letsetsa gongwe le gongwe, tse dingwe di diretswe go neelana ka dielo tse di solegelang molemo tsa go letsa tsa setlhopha se se rileng sa dinaga."" ( ...many cards are programmed to call each other, some are used to provide mutually beneficial discounts for group calls in countries with a developed network.)  This implies that the discounts are linked to using **unlimited phone numbers.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di kgona go bonwa fela mo dinageng tse di rileng:** The passage doesn't limit this to only developed countries.
*   **C: Mabenkeleng a mannye:** While the initial sentence mentions banks, the information about discounts is specifically tied to the phone numbers.
*   **D: Ka go dirisa mesokelatsebeng le go duela tlhwatlhwa e e oketsegileng:** This describes a regular phone call, not the special discounts mentioned in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya ditlhare tse di latelang e e sa tlwaelegang thata mo phakeng ya Plitvice Lakes ya bosetšhaba?","The correct answer is **B: Moakere (Oak)**.

The text specifically states that Plitvice Lakes is full of beech, spruce, and fir trees, as well as Alpine and Mediterranean plants. It also mentions the presence of a very diverse fauna.  Oak trees are *not* mentioned as being prevalent in the area. Therefore, oak would be the unusual and harder-to-find tree among the options listed.
"
Ke eng ya diphologolo tse di latelang tse di sa tlwaelesegang tse di ka bonwang mo phakeng ya Plitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The text specifically mentions ""capercaillie"" as one of the unusual birds found in the Plitvice Lakes area. The other options are not mentioned in the text as being present there.
"
"Go ya ka temana,dikhoutu tsa lefelo totatota, di thusa ka eng?","The correct answer is **B: Taolo mo mebarakeng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Boikaelelo tota tota ke go naya dikhampani tseo taolo e e oketsegileng mo mebarakeng ya tona; ke kgang ya go dira lotseno.""  This translates to: ""This rationale overall gives companies complete control over their markets; it is the reason for doing business.""  

The passage connects the ""control over markets"" (taolo mo mebarakeng) to the overall rationale behind using these protections.  The other options are incorrect because the passage *discredits* the idea that these protections prevent illegal copying or help with copying, and it doesn't mention making copies illegally.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang tse e seng nnete , tse di bolelwang ka dikhoutu tsa lefelo ke dikomponi tsa metswedi ya tshedimosetso?","The correct answer is **B: Di thusa go tila go kopolola mo go seng ka fa molaong**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tota e bile, dikhoutu tsa lefelo ga di na thuse ka sepe mo ditirong go kopolola mo go seng ka fa molaong..."" which translates to ""However, local franchises do not help in preventing illegal practices in transactions...""

The other options are supported by the text:

* **A: Di tlhokega go naya dikhamphani taolo ya mebaraka e e oketsegileng** - The text says: ""Boikaelelo tota tota ke go naya dikhampani tseo taolo e e oketsegileng mo mebarakeng ya tsone; ke kgang ya go dira lotseno."" which means ""This rationale is to give companies full control over their markets; it's the reason for doing business.""
* **C: Ke kgang ya go dira lotseno** -  As mentioned above, the text directly connects the franchises' purpose to ""ke kgang ya go dira lotseno"" - ""it's the reason for doing business.""
* **D: Ga di na thuso ka sepe mo ditirong go kopolola mo go seng ka fa molaong** - This is the exact statement made in the text.



Therefore, option B is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the text.



"
"Fa o boela mo lefatsheng la gaeno,ke tsmaiso efe, e ka tlwaelo, e seng ya semmuso?","The correct answer is **A: Go phuruphutsha ga ba lephata la mosepele**

Here's why:

* The question asks about a non-official, customary way to re-enter the world of ancestors.
* The passage states: ""Le ntswa ba lephata ba mesepele e se ga ntsi ba phuruphutsha motho fa a boela mo lefatsheng la ga gabo..."" (The ancestors are the gatekeepers; they lead a person when they return to the land of their fathers...). This implies that being led by the ancestors *is* the customary way of returning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Netefatsa gore o itse se se letleletsweng le se se sa letlelelweng:**  Knowing the proper rituals (the good and the bad) is important, but it's not the *way* of returning itself. It's preparation.
* **C: Seelo se se beilweng sa dilo:** ""Seelo se se beilweng"" translates to ""established rules"" or ""set rules."" While rules are part of the process, they don't define the core customary act.
* **D: Ba taolo ya dithoto:** ""Ba taolo ya dithoto"" translates to ""they are the control of spirits."" While the ancestors *are* spirit-like, this doesn't explain *how* one returns.

Therefore, the passage directly links returning to the ancestors with being led by them (""Go phuruphutsha ga ba lephata la mosepele"").



"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang seo o tshwanetseng go se itse pele o boela mo lefatsheng la gaeno?,"The correct answer is **B: Fa o tlhoka go bega tsotlhe tse di bontsi jo bo fetang seelo se se beilweng ka fa molaong.**

Here's why:

The question states that the *ntswa* (spirits/ancestors) can cause harm to those returning to their homeland, and their power can steal memories.  It then emphasizes the importance of knowing the good and bad things to avoid when entering the homeland, and adhering to the prescribed rules.

Option B directly addresses this crucial point:  **You need to observe all the prescribed rules when entering the homeland.** This is the action needed to ensure a safe and respectful return.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Fa go ka nna le lefelo la go phuruphutsha fa motho a boela mo lefatsheng la gaabo (There might be a place of harm when a person returns to their homeland):** While this is a risk, it's a consequence to be *avoided* by following the rules, not a necessary fact to *know* beforehand.
* **C: Fa go nna le taolo ya dithoto (There is control of spirits):** This is true according to the question, but knowing about the spirits *themselves* isn't as important as knowing how to *interact* with them safely.
* **D: Fa nngwe ya dilo tse o di tsenyang di sa letlelelwa (That one of the things you are doing is disliked):** This is a possible scenario, but again, following the rules is the proactive solution to avoid disliked actions.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se leng ka bontsi, se se kgontshang bapagami go atisa go ipetlela ditsela tse diša mo teng ga Cochamó Valley?","The correct answer is **C: Mafelo a a kgatlhisang (Stunning views)**.

The text states: ""Ditlhoa tsa dithaba di kgontsha motho go bona mafelo a a kgatlhisang."" which translates to ""Mountain peaks make people see stunning views."" This directly answers the question about what attracts the climbers to Cochamó Valley.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e neilweng mo temaneng, ke mang yo a fetang mo makgabaganyong a mantsi mo Sephatlong sa Borwa?","The correct answer is **A: SkyTeam**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ga gona kgolagano epe ya difofane e e fetang mo makgabaganyong otlhe ka boraro a a mo Sephatlong sa Borwa (e bile SkyTeam ga se fete mo go lepe)."" This translates to ""There is no single alliance that operates across all three regions of Southern Africa (except SkyTeam which does not operate in the south).""

Therefore, SkyTeam has the most extensive presence in Southern Africa.
"
"Ke kgolagano efe ya difofane, e e fetang mo palong e nnye thata ya makgabaganyo mo Sephatlong sa Borwa?","The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

The text explicitly states: ""Star Alliance e tsamaya gotlhe kwa ntle ga botlhaba jwa Borwa jwa Pacific go tswa kwa Santiago de Chile go ya kwa Tahiti, e e leng sefofane sa LATAM Oneworld. **(bona kwa tlase)**"" This means Star Alliance is the only alliance that operates across all three regions of Southern Africa.
"
"Ke mokgatlho ofe o o dirang tiro ya go bontsha bajanala lefelo , o o tlileng morago ga Global Running Tours?","The correct answer is **A: Running ya Copenhagen**.

The passage states: ""Motlhatlhami wa Globala Running Tours, Go Running Tours o golaganya ditlhopha di le lesome-le-bobedi tsa batlamedi ba batabogi ba lefelo mo dikontinenteng di le nne. E simolotse e le Barcelona Running Tours ya ko Barcelona, le Copenhagen Running ya ko Copenhagen, mme ka bofefo ya kopana le Running Tours Prague ya ko Prague, le tse dingwe.""

This means Copenhagen Running was one of the first running tours established and is mentioned before other specific locations like Prague and Barcelona.

"Go ya ka temana, Go Running Tours e thusa go golaganya ditlhopha di le kae tse di farologaneng tsa batabogi?","The correct answer is **A: Nne**.

The passage states: ""Go golaganya ditlhopha di le lesome-le-bobedi tsa batlamedi ba batabogi ba lefelo mo dikontinenteng di le nne."" which translates to ""Go runs groups of twenty-one local tourist groups on four continents."" Therefore, the answer is four continents.
"
Mojanala o tshwanetse a dire eng fa a solofela go bona letose sentle?,"The correct answer is **C: Didiriswa tsa go bonela kgakala (Binoculars)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Fa o tshotse dididrisiwa dingwe le dingwe fela le tse di sa tureng tota o ka kgona go di bona sentle."" (If you only have binoculars and those not in the distance, you can see them clearly.) This directly links binoculars to better viewing of animals.
* Option A, ""Eya hiking safari"" (Go on a hiking safari) is a possibility, but not the *best* answer based on the text. While hiking allows for closer observation, the text doesn't specifically say it's the key to seeing animals *well*.
* Option B, ""Eya safaring ya dinao ya sekgwa"" (Go on a walking safari) is similar to A and less specific than C.
* Option D, ""Tsaya koloi mme o dirise didiriswa tse di tlwaelegileng"" (Stop the car and use regular binoculars) is incorrect. The text mentions that you can see animals better *if you only have* binoculars, implying they are essential for good viewing.

Therefore, binoculars are the most directly and explicitly linked tool for improved animal viewing according to the provided text.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mofuta ofe wa phologolo o moeng a ka nneng a kopana le one ka nako ya leeto ka koloi?","The correct answer is **A: Ditau**.

The text states: ""Ditau, dinkwe le matotse di na le ditlhong nako dingwe mme o ka se bona botoka fa o dirisa dibonela-kgakala."" This translates to ""Elephants, antelopes, and baboons have different habits and you can see them easily if you use binoculars."" Since the question asks about a species that *might* be seen on a car safari, and elephants are mentioned as being visible with binoculars, they are the most likely answer.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka dirang gore leeto le nne tlhwatlhwatlase?","The correct answer is **B: Kopana le batho ba bangwe, le itireng segopana sa batho ba le bane.**

Here's why:

* The question asks how to make a journey *more interesting*.
* The passage states that traveling with a group of four people (or more) allows you to see different perspectives and the unique qualities of others.
* Option B directly reflects this idea of traveling with others to have a more enriching experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fa o le mongwe** (If you are alone): While being alone can be peaceful, the passage doesn't suggest it makes a journey more interesting. It's the opposite, it emphasizes the benefit of group travel.
* **C: O tsamaya le tsala e le nngwe fela** (You travel with a pet alone):  The passage focuses on human interaction, not animals.
* **D: Kopana le batho ba bangwe, le itireng segopana sa batho ba le barataro le go feta** (Meet other people, and travel in a group of older people and beyond): This option is too specific and doesn't capture the core idea of the passage which is about a group of four.  The phrase ""le go feta"" (and beyond) is also unclear in this context.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo o ka nneng a bona seelo se se gaisang sa leeto?","The correct answer is **A: Bajanala ba a fapanngwa go tlatsa dikoloi** (People of different origins to fill the cars).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Le go le jalo, tota tota seno ga se a tshwanela go go tshwenya, ka go nne ga ntsi bajanala ba a fapanngwa go tlatsa dikoloi. Seno go bonala tota tota e le tsela ya go tsietsa batho go re ba dumele go re ba tshwanetse go duela madi a kwa godimo.""

This translates to: ""And yet, this should not worry you, because many people of different origins are filling the cars. This appears to be a way to trick people into letting them pay more money.""

Therefore, the people who are described as having a ""seelo se se gaisang sa leeto"" (a leading/guiding pattern for the journey) are the ""bajanala ba a fapanngwa go tlatsa dikoloi"" - the people of different origins who are filling the cars. They are presented as the ones who are setting the pace or the pattern for the journey.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se dirileng gore San Francisco e itsege lefatshe ka bophara?","The correct answer is **B: Mafaratlhatlhatlha a magolo a bojanala**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""San Francisco e tlhomile mafaratlhatlha a magolo a bojanala a a akaretsang dihotele di le mmalwa, mafelo a dijo mmogo le mafelo a maemo a a kwa godimo a go tshwarelwang diphuthego mo one."" (San Francisco boasts major luxury attractions including several hotels, restaurants, and rooftop bars.)  This is a key reason for its global recognition.

Let's look at why the other options are not the primary reason, although they contribute:

* **A: Itsholelo e kabakanye (Itsholelo ya yone e kabakanye):**  While the passage mentions its iconic skyline, it's presented as *part* of the reason for global recognition, not the main driver.
* **C: Go supiwa thata ga yone mo botaking bo bo farologaneng le mo dibukeng (Go supiwa thata ga yone mo botaking bo bo farologaneng le mo dibukeng):** This is mentioned, but the passage gives more weight to the luxury attractions.
* **D: Dijo tsa Asia ka mefuta yotlhe (Dijo tsa Asia ka mefuta yotlhe):**  These are a significant draw, but not the *primary* reason for global recognition, which is the broader range of luxury attractions.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa dipolelo ka San Francisco tse e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: E supilwe thata mo difiliming le dibukeng**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Go supiwa thata ga yone mo mminong, mo difiliming, mo di dibukeng le ka kakaretso fela, di dirile gore toropo eno e itsege lefatshe ka bophara.""  This translates to: ""It has been widely portrayed in movies, in books, and in general, which has made the city known worldwide."" This indicates that the city's portrayal in media is a significant factor in its fame.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lefelo le le botoka thata kwa go nang le dijo tsa Asia:** The text *does* mention a wide variety of Asian cuisine, so this is accurate, not false.
* **C: Go na le dihotele di le mmalwa le mafelo a maemo a kwa godimo a go tshwarelwang diphuthego mo one:** The text *does* mention hotels and rooftop bars, so this is accurate, not false.
* **D: Itsholelo e remeletse mo bojanaleng:** The text *does* state that the city's appeal has contributed to its popularity, so this is accurate, not false.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mofuta ofe wa mojanala yo a ka nneng a se bone molemo wa go dirisa ditirelo tsa barulaganyi ba mesepele?","The correct answer is **A: Fa o tlhoka go ikakanye ka se ba go fang sone**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ba kgona go go tshegeletsa kopo ya gago fa o tlhoka nako gore o ikakanye ka se ba se go fang kgotsa o sentle o rulaganya dipampiri tse dingwe tsa mosepele (jaaka visa)."" This means one benefit of using travel agents is getting time to review the options they present.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Le fa ka dinako dingwe go na le kgonagalo ya gore o iponele mefuta e mengwe ya boroko, jaaka go kampa:** While travel agents *can* help with alternative accommodations like hostels, it's not the primary benefit mentioned in relation to *reviewing options*.
* **C: Ba kgona go rulaganya dipampiri tse dingwe tsa mesepele, jaaka Visa:**  This is a *function* travel agents can perform, but it's not the main reason someone would find them beneficial *at the start* of planning.
* **D: Mojanala yo o beeletsang maeto a akaretsang tsotlhe (dijo,boroko, dipalangwa, jalojalo:** This describes the *type* of service a travel agent offers, not a specific benefit a traveler would seek.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang mo temaneng e le molemo wa go beeletsa ka barulaganyi ba mesepele?","The correct answer is **D: Ba kgona go go tshegeletsa kopo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travel agents can ""go tshegeletsa kopo ya gago fa o tlhoka nako gore o ikakanye ka se ba se go fang kgotsa o sentle o rulaganya dipampiri tse dingwe tsa mosepele (jaaka visa)."" This means they assist with applications, which is a key benefit of using a travel agent.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Rulaganya dipampiri tse dingwe tsa mesepele, jaaka Visa:** While travel agents *might* help with this, it's not the core benefit described.  They offer a broader range of assistance.
* **B: Barulaganya-mesepele ba dirisanya le dihotele dingwe tse di rileng:** The passage mentions this as a *possible* scenario where travel agents can help. It's a feature, not the most important.
* **C: Maeto a a akaretsang tsotlhe:**  This is a product travel agents *sell*, not a service they *provide* as a benefit of using them.

Therefore, the ability to assist with applications is the most prominently mentioned and valuable service offered by travel agents according to the passage.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se ditiriso tsa thanolo ya mafoko tse di direlang ka bonako di sa kgoneng go se dira?","The correct answer is **D: Go ranolola ka nepagalo, ka dinako tsotlhe** (To translate accurately, all the time).

Here's why:

The passage states that while these translation tools are powerful, they aren't perfect. It explicitly mentions the risk of errors because they are often trained on large datasets, including unlabeled data. Therefore, they *cannot* translate accurately *all the time*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ranola mafoko a dipuo tsa dinaga di sele mo matshwaong** (To translate foreign language words in real-time): The passage says these tools *can* do this.
* **B: Go ranolola seele sotlhe jaaka se ntse** (To translate everything as it is):  The passage indicates they can translate ""everything"" to some degree, but not necessarily *perfectly*.
* **C: Go ranolola sekwalwa ka go supa ka mogala wa letheka** (To translate text by hovering with a mouse): The passage doesn't mention this functionality.

Therefore, option D is the only one that accurately reflects the limitations discussed in the passage.



"
Ke eng se se kgontshang thanolo go dirwa go se na inthanete?,"The correct answer is **A: Dienjene tsa thanolo tse di tokafaditsweng (Tokafaditso ya Google Translate, etc.)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dienjene tsa thanolo di tokafaditswe ka selekanyo se se kwa godimo tota..."" This directly addresses the question of what is responsible for translation *without* internet.  The passage is explaining that advanced translation engines, like Google Translate (which can work offline after downloading language packs), are the key.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mogala wa letheka (Offline dictionary)** While an offline dictionary can assist with word lookups, the passage focuses on the *engines* powering translation, not just dictionaries.
* **C: Laisolola tshedimosetso ya puo e o e batlang (Downloading language packs)** Downloading language packs is a *step* in preparing for offline translation, but it's not the core of *what makes* translation possible offline.
* **D: Ditiriso tsa thanolo tse di direlang ka bonako, tse di mo setlhopheng seno (The ""smart"" translation tools in this group)** This is too general. The passage specifically points to the *engines* within those tools as the key factor.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa iseng kapoko kwa tlase?","The correct answer is **A: Kapoko e a kgomarela**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bothata ke gore kapoko e a kgomarela, ka jalo e tlhoka go isiwa kwa tlase..."" which translates to ""The problem is that the snowpack can avalanche, therefore it needs to be evacuated downhill...""

The question asks which of the options *doesn't* cause an avalanche. The passage implies the avalanche is triggered *by* the snowpack collapsing (kgomarela).  The other options (people, sunshine, normal snowfall) are listed as *potential* triggers, but the passage explicitly states the *snowpack collapsing* is the problem causing the need for evacuation.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa tse di latelang, tse di kgokologang e le diavalanche?","The correct answer is **A: Kapoko e e kgomarelang, e sa isiwa kwa tlase**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that an avalanche is triggered when a snowpack accumulates on a slope. 
* A **compacted snowpack** is more likely to trigger an avalanche because it's unstable and can release under the weight of new snow or other factors. 
* The passage also mentions that the problem is that the snowpack can **accumulate** and needs to be released downhill, implying an unstable and potentially dangerous situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Letlhakore la thaba kwa ntle ga kapoko:** This refers to the slope itself, not the snowpack.
* **C: Kapoko e ntsi thata mo letlhakoreng la thaba:**  The passage says it's *not* a large, dense snowpack that's the problem, but rather a compacted one. A large, dense snowpack is less likely to trigger an avalanche.
* **D: Kapoko e tlogetswe e sa angwa ke batho:** While this can contribute to avalanche danger, the passage focuses on the properties of the snowpack itself being unstable.



"
"Go ya ka temana,kheri e dirilwe ka didiriswa dife?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlhatsana le dipaese**.

The text states: ""Khari ke dijo tse di dirilweng ka ditlhatsana le dipaese, ga mmogo le nama kgotsa merogo."" which translates to ""Curry is food made with flour and spices, along with meat or vegetables.""
"
"Mo dikgaolong tse dingwe, mašwi a coconut a dirisiwa, ka dinako dingwe, mo legatong la sediriswa se feng mo kharing?","The answer is **A: Nama (Meat)**.

The text states: ""Mo mafelong a a kgakajana le lewatle kwa bokone jwa India le Pakistan, yogurt e dirisiwa mo di sopong tsa khari. Kwa borwa jwa India le mafelo a mangwe a a fa lewatleng, go dirisiwa maswi a coconut thata."" This implies that in other regions (like those in the north of India and along the coasts), coconut is used in *meat* curries.
"
Goreng go dikologa dithaba go tlhokega go ya kwa phitlhelelong?,"The correct answer is **B: Kapoko e e gatisitsweng e kotsi.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ga se motsamo o o bonolo, se se raya gore tsela ya teng e dikologa dithaba go fitlhela ko phitlhelelong."" This translates to ""It is not an easy journey, it involves traversing mountains to reach the South Pole.""

This implies that the mountain traversal is a dangerous aspect of the traverse, making it a risky expedition.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Seteišene sa McMurdo gantsi, se tswetswe:** While McMurdo Station is the starting point, its construction doesn't directly explain *why* mountain traversal is dangerous.
* **C: Diterekere tse di kgethegileng ga di tsamaye bonolo:**  The passage mentions that only specialized vehicles can be used, but this describes a logistical challenge, not the inherent danger of the mountain traversal itself.
* **D: E motlhofo go na le go tsamaya ka tsela ya Ross Sea:** The passage describes the Tselakgolo as traversing the Ross Sea route.  It doesn't suggest the Ross Sea route is more dangerous; it focuses on the danger of the mountain traversal.



"
"Go bapa le South Pole Traverse (kgotsa Tselakgolo), ke eng se se tshwailweng ka difolaga?","The correct answer is **C: Diphatlha tse di katetsweng kapoko**.

The text states: ""Ke kapoko e e gatisitsweng le diphatlha tse di katetsweng le go tshwaiwa ka difolaga."" This directly translates to ""It is a traverse secured with tracked vehicles and winches."" Therefore, the traverse is secured with tracked vehicles *and* winches (difolaga).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsela kwa McMurdo Station:** The traverse *starts* at McMurdo Station, but it's not what's secured *with* winches.
* **B: Diterekere tse di gogang selei sa leokwane:** While tracked vehicles are used, the question asks what's secured *with* winches. The traverse *is* secured with winches.
* **D: Go dikologa mo go kotsi mo dithabeng:** The difficult terrain is *part* of the traverse, but not what's secured with winches.



"
Ke eng se se sa umakiwang mo temaneng e le sengwe se bajanala ba tshwanetseng go se ela tlhoko fa ba etela mo borwa jwa Aforika?,"The correct answer is **A: Melawana le madi a dipampiri tsa teseletso ya mosepele tsa Visa di farologana ka mafatshe.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Melawana le madi a dipampiri tsa teseletso ya mosepele tsa Visa di farologana ka mafatshe e bile e laolwa ke lefatshe le o tlholegang kwa go lone.""  This is a crucial piece of information for anyone planning to travel to North Africa, as visa requirements and costs vary by country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tsamaya ka koloi ke tsela e e siameng ya go etela mafelo a a seng mo mebileng e e tlwaelegileng ya bojanala:** While traveling by car is *a* way to see North Africa, the passage doesn't say it's the *most common* or *ideal* way. It simply presents it as an option.
* **C: Mo e ka nnang mafatshe otlhe a a bapileng le borwa jwa Aforika a tletse thitibalo:** The passage says *North Africa* is mostly desert, not all of the world.
* **D: Ka jaana bontsi jwa mafelo go ka gorogwa kwa go one fela ka koloi e e emetseng fa godimo ya 4x4:**  This is true, but the passage isn't highlighting this as something to be particularly aware of *before* traveling. It's just a statement about the landscape.



Therefore, visa requirements are the most important logistical detail the passage emphasizes that a traveler should be aware of beforehand.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka tsewang e le keletso e e sa siamang go bajanala ba ba batlang go tlhotlhomisa borwa jwa Aforika ka koloi?","The correct answer is **D: Ga se mafatshe otlhe mo borwa jwa Aforika a tletseng thitibalo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Go gakologelwe fa o dira dithulaganyo go re e re ntswa kgaolo ya Bora jwa Afrika e tletse thitibalo ga se mafatshe otlhe a a mo tikologong a a ntseng jalo."" (It is advised when you make calculations that the region of North Africa is full of obstacles, not the entire world in such a climate.)

Options A, B, and C are all mentioned in the passage, but option D is the *most* significant and relevant caveat to the idea of traveling North Africa by car. It highlights that the region is not uniformly challenging; some areas are not as obstacle-ridden as others.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e sa umakiwang mo temaneng e le kotsi e e ka tlisiwang ke gore o kgaogane le dibeke tsa gago?,"The correct answer is **B: O ka nna wa iphitlhela o dirisitswe go rwala ditagi o sa itse.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""O ka nna wa iphitlhela o dirisitswe go rwala ditagi o sa itse, mme seo se ka go tsenya mo mathateng a a seng kana ka sepe."" (You might find yourself being used to kill unknown tags, and that can get you into trouble.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di ka utswiwa** (They can be caught): While it's possible to catch them, the passage focuses on the danger of encountering them.
*   **C: Di ka tsewa gore ke tsa motho o mongwe** (They can be known to be someone else's): The passage doesn't mention whether the tags belong to someone else.
*   **D: Baokamedi ba lefelo ba ka belaela, bogolo thata jang fa go kile ga nna le matshosetsi a dibomo** (Local authorities can accuse, no matter how difficult it is if there have been bomb threats): While authorities *might* accuse, the passage is more directly concerned with the immediate risk to an individual.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the text."
Ke eng se se sa umakiwang mo temaneng tebang le go rwala ditagi?,"The correct answer is **A: Mo mafatsheng a mangwe, e le la ntlha motho a dirile molato, kotlhao e kgona go nna loso.**

Here's why:

* The text specifically states, ""Mafatshe mangwe a dirisa dikotlhao tse setlhogo phetelela le e le la ntlha motho a dirile molato ; e kgona go akaretsa katlholelo dingwaga tse 10 mo kgolegelong kgotsa loso."" This means the risk of a severe punishment (years in prison or death) is unique to those countries.
* The other options are mentioned in the text but aren't presented as something *not* found in other countries:
    * **B: Ikele tlhoko thata fa o kgabaganya melolwane:** The text *does* state it's dangerous to harass animals.
    * **C: Dintša tse di dirisiwang go dupa ditagi di ka nna tsa dirisiwa nako nngwe le nngwe ntle le tsiboso:** This is mentioned as a risk.
    * **D: Baokamedi ba ka go amoga dibeke, le fa o sa tsamaise ditagi:** The text says harassment can lead to severe consequences, not just a few weeks.



"
"Ke mofuta ofe wa seno, o o sa umakiwang e le sengwe se o ka lekang go se dira kwa gae fa o na o le nosi?","The correct answer is **D: Tee**.

The passage specifically mentions chamomile tea as a calming drink to have when feeling stressed or overwhelmed, especially when you're at home.  It also suggests seeking tea at a cafe or nearby shop if you're out and about. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Matute (Matcha):** While matcha can be calming, the passage doesn't mention it.
*   **B: Kofi (Coffee):** The passage suggests *avoiding* coffee when feeling stressed.
*   **C: Biri (Beer):** The passage advises *against* getting drunk in public.



"
"Ke dife tsa tse di latelang, tse o tshwanetseng o di etele fa o le nosi, fa toropo ya gago e itsege ka mokgwa wa yone wa go nwa bojalwa?","The correct answer is **C: Diphabo tse o sa yeng go tsone kgapetsa.**

Here's why:

The passage advises finding a quiet place to relax when feeling stressed. It specifically suggests going to a cafe or a family member's place *away from the usual spots* where people go to drink alcohol. This implies avoiding places known for heavy drinking in your town.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mabenkele a kofi kwa ntle ga toropo ya gago:** While getting coffee is suggested, simply going to a cafe *in* your town is not the primary recommendation. The passage wants a place *away* from the usual alcohol-drinking spots.
* **B: Mabenkele a juse kgotsa smoothy:** This is similar to A. It offers a relaxing activity but doesn't address the need to avoid alcohol-heavy places.
* **D: Mafelo a bojelo a titielang tee ya khemomaele:** This is a specific type of tea and not directly related to finding a place to relax and avoid alcohol-centric environments.



"
Maphoi a a betlilweng a beilwe kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Mo jarateng ya kereke**.

The text explicitly states: ""Go tsaya halofo ya ura go tsamaya tsamaya mo motseng ono o o kgatlhisang. **Mo jarateng ya kereke, gona le maphoi a a kgatlhisang, a a betwileng ka mmabole, fa godimo ga mabitla a mangwe.**"" (It takes half an hour to walk around the village. **In the churchyard, there are decorative sculptures, made of marble, above some graves.**)
"
Ke mofuta ofe wa visa o o ka tlhokang gore mongwe a tlamele bopaki jwa tshegetso e e lekaneng ka madi?,"The correct answer is **B: Visa ya bojanala** (Student Visa).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Gape o tla tshwanelwa ke go ntsa sesupo sa go re o na le madi a go ituelela sekolo le go itshetsa ngwaga wa ntlha wa sekolo."" (You will also be required to provide proof that you have sufficient funds to cover your studies and living expenses for a full academic year.)

This requirement for proof of sufficient funds is a key element of applying for a student visa. Business visas and tourist visas don't typically have this specific financial requirement tied to studying. While a visitor visa *might* be an option for a short-term visit, it wouldn't be appropriate for staying long enough to attend school.
"
"Ke mang, thata, yo a ka nnang a tlhoka Visa e e atolositsweng?","The correct answer is **C: Moithuti wa boditšhabatšhaba (International Student)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tetlelelo ya baithuti go ya kwa dinageng tse dingwe e nale ditlhokego tse di farologaneng go tsa bajanala kgotsa bo-rrakgwebo Mo mafatsheng ka bontsi, go tlhokwa lekwalo le le supang go re o amogeletswe ko sekolong se o eletsang go ithuta ko go sone."" This directly refers to international students who need a visa to study abroad.
"
"O tshwanetse o tlhokomele menang neng, segolobogolo?","The correct answer is **C: Mo sekgweng sa pula**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka selemo, segolobogolo, o tla tshwanela go tlhokomela menang fa o swetsa ka go re o batla go haeka mo dikgweng tsa pula."" which translates to ""Throughout the year, elephant, you must take care of where you stay if you want to stay in the rain forests.""  It then goes on to clarify that this is specifically *in the rain forest*.

The other options are not as accurate:

*   **A: Ka dikgwedi tsa selemo** (Throughout the months of the year) - While related, it's less specific than ""in the rain forest.""
*   **B: Fa o haeka** (When you leave) - This refers to leaving, not the location where the elephant needs to take care.
*   **D: Fa o kgweetsa** (When you travel) - This refers to travel, not where the elephant needs to be.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se o sa tshwanelang go se dira go tila menang fa o kgweetsa go ralala sekgwa sa pula?","The correct answer is **A: Go tlogela dikgoro tsa sejanaga di butswe sebaka** (Don't remove the dust layers that have settled).

Here's why:

The passage states that when you are driving through a sandstorm, dust layers can accumulate on your vehicle.  It's crucial *not* to remove these layers because they act as a seal, protecting the vehicle's components from damage. Removing them would expose the vehicle to the full force of the storm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go kgweetsa ka selemo** (Drive slowly): While driving slowly is generally a good practice in a sandstorm, the passage doesn't explicitly state that it's something you *must not do*.
* **C: Go kgweetsa go ralala mafelo a boboatsatsi** (Drive to avoid the clouds of dust): This is not mentioned in the passage. The focus is on what to do *while* you're in the storm.
* **D: Go tlogela sejanaga se sa tlhokomelwa fa o haeka** (Don't remove the dust layers that aren't important when you leave):  This is partially related to option A but option A is more directly related to what should not be done *while driving* through the storm.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the passage's advice.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa dipolelo tseno ka Sundarbans tse e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Bontlhabongwe jwa yone bo apesitswe ke mafelo a loraga.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Dikgwa tse ga se mafelo a loraga a a tletseng metsi fela, go na le mafelo a kileng a bo a aperwe ke dikgwa tse di tona tse di kitlameng, tse di tala."" This directly contradicts option B, which claims its biodiversity is based on aquatic forests.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Go na le mafelo a kileng a bo a aperwe ke dikgwa tse di tona, tse di kitlaneng, tse di tala:** The text states this directly.
* **C: Ke sekgwa se se pataganeng sa ditlhare tsa mangrove tse di bapisitseng lewatle,se se di fetang tsotlhe mo lefatseng:** This is stated in the first sentence.
* **D: Ke legae la diphala dintsi tse di bonweng foo, go feta dinkwe tsa Bengal:** The text says ""Gompieno go akanyediwa go ka tswa go na le dinkwe tsa Royal Bengal di le 400 (makgolo a mane) le diphala di ka nna 30, 000 (dikete di le masome a marandu) mo lefelong la teng."" This indicates a large number of species, including more than just Bengal tigers.



"
Ke karolo efe ya sekgwa e letseng mo nageng ya India?,"The correct answer is **A: Phaka ya bosetšhaba ya Sundarbans (Sundarbans National Park)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lefelo la sekgwa se le le mo nageng ya India lebitswa Sundarbans National Park.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo go ka fitlhelwang a na le , bonnye, go tlhaloganya mo go lekanyeditsweng, ga puo ya sejatlhapi go gaisa bangwe?","The correct answer is **A: Batho ba ba buang, bonnye, diteme tse dingwe tse pedi**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights the difficulty of translating between languages, even when people from different linguistic backgrounds are present. The example of people from Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, and Sydney having difficulty understanding each other illustrates this.  The question asks who is *least* likely to have their language easily translated. The passage implies that speakers of languages *other* than the common language of the group (presumably English, given the locations) would face the most difficulty. Therefore, the individuals who are speaking *other* languages are the ones least likely to have their meaning easily translated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Batho ba dingwaga tse di kwa tlase:** Age isn't directly linked to language difficulty in the passage.
* **C: Batho ba ba tsayang mesepele go ya kwa Toronto:**  Traveling to Toronto doesn't inherently make someone's language easier to translate.
* **D: Batho ba dingwaga tse di kwa godimo:** Age isn't directly linked to language difficulty in the passage.

"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se go ka nnang thata go se bitsa?","The correct answer is **C: Mafoko a a kwadilweng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gape, go le ga ntsi go motlhofo go tlhaloganya mafoko a a kwadilweng botoka go na le a a buiwang."" This translates to ""Also, the large number of languages makes it difficult to accurately transcribe spoken words."" 

Therefore, the difficulty lies in transcribing *written* words, not in the languages themselves, the dishes, or the people.

"Go ya ka temana, ke seemo sefe se se ka siamelang mosepedi yo o ikaelelang go tshwara bese go tswa kwa seteišeneng sa dibese tse di tsamaelang ko dikgaolong di sele?","The correct answer is **A: Moeti o lebile Jakar mme o setse a rekile thekete pele.**

Here's why:

The passage states that buses going to more remote areas (like Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM. It also says that buses to more distant locations are often full, so it's recommended to buy a ticket in advance. Option A describes a situation where the traveler went to Jakar and bought a ticket *before* 6:30 AM, which aligns with the recommendation to purchase tickets in advance for the earlier departures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moeti o lebile Bumthang mme o tlhoka go tloga ka 7:**  The passage specifies departure times between 6:30-7:30, making a 7:00 AM departure perfectly feasible. Buying a ticket beforehand is still recommended. While it's *possible*, it's not as strongly suggested as Option A.
* **C: Mosepedi o lebile Paro mme o tlhoka go tloga morago ga 11:**  The passage doesn't mention Paro's departure times.  Furthermore, buying a ticket *after* 11 AM isn't the point of the passage which is about avoiding full buses.
* **D: Moeti o lebile botlhaba mme o goroga kwa seteišeneng pele ga 6:20:** The passage doesn't mention a destination called ""botlhaba"" or a time before 6:20.



"
Ke eng seo e ka nnang keletso e e siameng go mojanala yo a batlang go ya botlhaba go tswa seteišeneng sa dibese tse di tsamaelang kwa dikgaolong di sele?,"The correct answer is **B: Reka thekete malatsinyana pele o tsaya loeto.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ka gore dibese tse di tsamaelang ko dikgaolong di sele di nna go botoka o reka thekethe ya bese malatsinyana pele o tsaya loeto."" (Because the buses traveling to the remote areas are often full, it's advisable to buy a ticket in advance before taking the trip.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dibese fela, di tloga morago ga 8:30** - The passage says most buses leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
* **C: Dibese tse dintsi di tloga motshegare otlhe** - The passage indicates buses to remote areas are often full, implying they are not constantly running.
* **D: Thekisi e e kopanelwang e ka nna mokgwa o botlhale wa go tsamaya** - While the passage mentions the types of buses, it doesn't suggest the connecting service is a better way to travel.

Therefore, buying a ticket in advance is the most logical advice based on the information provided."
"Ke efe ya e latelang e e seng tlhaloso ka nepagalo, ya Timbuktu?","The correct answer is **C: Ga o kgone go e fitlhelela ka sefofane** (You can't reach it by boat).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Timbuktu ke toropo e e humanegileng, le fa e itsege ka go nna kgogedi ya bajanala, gape e na le boemafofane."" (Timbuktu is an established town, even though it is known as a center of learning, it also has a strategic location.) This indicates it *can* be reached.
* **The text mentions:** ""Go kopanya le go sa fitlhelelwe bonolo, """"Timbuku"""" e setse e diriswa jaaka tshwantshiso ya dinaga tse di sa tlwaelegang, tse di kgakala."" (Getting to Timbuktu and not being easily accessible, ""Timbuktu"" was used as a metaphor for unusual, remote places.) This implies it *was* difficult to reach historically, but not impossible.
* **The text states:** ""Ka ngwaga wa 1990, e ne ya tsengwa mo maineng a mafelo a Ditso tsa Lefatshe a a mo kotsing, ka ntata ya go gomagomediwa ke motlhaba wa sekaka."" (In 1990, it was listed among the World Heritage Sites, due to being threatened by the Sahara Desert.) This confirms it *can* be reached and is a recognized place.
* **The text says:** ""Toropo e farologane thata le ditoropo tse dingwe tsotlhe tsa naga e, ka e lebega se-Arabea go na le se-Afrika."" (The town is different from all other towns in the country, being a blend of Arab and African.)

Therefore, the statement that you can't reach it by boat is not supported by the provided text.



"
Ke efe ya dintlha tse di latelang ka Timbuktu e e leng nnete?,"The correct answer is **C: E farologane thata le ditoropo tse dingwe tsa naga.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Toropo e farologane thata le ditoropo tse dingwe tsotlhe tsa naga e, ka e lebega se-Arabea go na le se-Afrika."" This directly translates to ""The town is hard to compare with other towns in the country, because it feels Arab rather than African.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Toropo e a fitlhelelwa ka sefofane:** The passage says ""Go kopanya le go sa fitlhelelwe bonolo,"" meaning it's *not* easily found, but it doesn't specify *how* it's not easily found (by foot or other means).
* **B: Go sa tlwaelege ga yone go feta go humanega:** The passage says ""Go sa tlwaelege ga yone go feta go humanega,"" which means it's *more* unusual than normal.
* **D: Ga e sa ngoka bajanala:** The passage states ""Ka ngwaga wa 1990, e ne ya tsengwa mo maineng a mafelo a Ditso tsa Lefatshe a a mo kotsing, ka ntata ya go gomagomediwa ke motlhaba wa sekaka."" This means it *was* considered endangered.



"
Diolimpiki tsa selemo di ne di rulaganyeditswe neng mo tshimologong? ,"The correct answer is **B: Mopitlwe 2020**.

The passage states: ""Tokyo etla nna toropo ele nosi ya kwa Asia e e amogetseng metshameko ya selemo ya di Olimpiki, e e ileng ya tshwara metshameko ka ngwaga wa 1964.""  It also mentions that the games were postponed due to the pandemic and that the games were originally scheduled for July 2020. Therefore, the games were originally planned for July 2020 (Mopitlwe 2020).
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke neng mo diphatlhanyana tse di fologang go tswa mo marung a setsuatsue, di nnang kgwanyape?","The correct answer is **D: Morago ga go kgoma mmu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Di simolola pele e le diphatlhanyana tse di fologang go tswa mo marung a setsuatsue, mme di bo di nna """"kgwanyape"""" fa di kgoma mmu.""

This translates to: ""They begin as small filaments sprouting from the roots of the plant, and then they become """"wasps"""" when they catch the wind.""

Therefore, the transformation into a ""wasp"" (kgwanyape) happens *after* they catch the wind (kgoma mmu).
"
"Ke sefe sa tseno, se e leng sebopego ka nepagalo, sa kgwanyape?","The correct answer is **A: Di dira diphefo tse di bogale(gantsi 100-200 ya dimmaele ka ura**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a type of spider that produces silk. Option A directly states the quantity of silk produced per hour (100-200 strands).  The passage emphasizes this as a key characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Di kgona go tsholetsa dilo tse di bokete mo moweng** - While true, this is a function of the silk, not the defining *body* characteristic.
* **C: Di nna pele le diphatlhanyana tse di fologang go tswa mo marung a setsuatsue, di bo di kgoma mmu** - This describes the spider's life cycle and how it becomes a spider, not a body characteristic *of* the spider itself.
* **D: Ke go dikologa ga phefo ya kgatelelo e e ko tlase, e e kgapelang moya kwa ntle** - This is a general description of the spider's habitat and function, not a specific body characteristic.

Therefore, the most specific and defining body characteristic mentioned in the passage is the silk production rate.



"
"Go ya ka temana,mojanala o tshwanetse a bone kgakololo go tswa kae tebang le seemo sa dipolotiki kwa toropong e a batlang go e etela?","The correct answer is **A: Go tswa pusong ya naga eo ba tla bong ba e etela.**

The text explicitly states: ""Go fa sekai, batho ba lefatshe la Amerika ba ka nna ba tsholwa ka tsela e e farologaneng le batho ba Europa kgotsa Ma-Arabea. Dikitsiso tseno ke tshoboko ya seemo sa diplotiki tsa lefatshe."" This indicates that the legal system and the potential for legal trouble depend on the laws and policies of the country being visited. Therefore, the origin of legal issues comes from the laws of the country the traveler is going to.
"
"Fa go na le dikitsiso tsa mosepele,ke eng se se ka nneng sa se diragalele motswantle?","The correct answer is **D: Tshedimosetso ka botlalo tebang le seemo sa polotiki sa naga.**

Here's why:

The passage discusses the challenges of navigating international travel insurance and the potential for political situations to impact travel. Option D directly addresses this by highlighting the need for final guidance and understanding of the political climate in a country.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Inshorense ya go emisa loeto e a amega:** While travel insurance is important, the passage focuses on broader challenges beyond just the insurance policy itself.
* **B: Tshoboko e e sa tsenelelang tebang le maemo a dipolotiki a lefatshe:** This is too general.  The passage specifies that political situations *can* impact travel negatively.
* **C: Inshorense ya botsogo e a amega:**  Similar to A, while important, it's not the central theme of the passage.



Therefore, understanding the political situation and seeking final advice are the most relevant responses to the challenges described."
"Go ya ka temana, ke mofuta ofe wa leeto o o ka tswang o ka se tlhoke thuso ka peeletso go tswa kwa moemeding wa tsa mesepele?","The correct answer is **A: Leeto la go ya phuthegong ya badiri mo toropong e mojanala a kileng a e etela peleng** (A trip to a local artisan's workshop in a village they've visited before).

Here's why:

The passage states that traditional crafts are often overpriced.  Option A suggests going directly to the artisan, likely eliminating the middleman and potentially getting a better price. The passage also mentions looking for reputable artisans online or in stores.  Going to the artisan's workshop is a direct way to find a reputable one.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Leeto la dibeke tse pedi ka madi a a lekanyeditsweng** (A two-week trip with a fixed budget): This is too vague. It doesn't guarantee access to affordable or authentic crafts.
* **C: Mojanala o tla gakololwa ka tlhago, setso le puo ya naga e a e etelang** (A tour will be guided by the culture, customs and language of the country they are visiting):  While a tour might mention crafts, it doesn't guarantee access to artisans or better prices. The passage warns about inflated prices on tours.
* **D: Leeto la ntlha la mojanala kwa moseja** (A first-time trip to a destination):  This is the *least* suitable because a first-time trip makes it harder to identify reputable artisans and potentially get good deals. You'd be more vulnerable to overcharging.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mo seemong sefe mo mojanala a ka solegelwang molemo ke thuso ya moemedi wa tsa mesepele?","The correct answer is **B: Fa mojanala a na le kgatlhego go peeletso ya leeto le le kgethegileng lekgetlho la ntlha.**

Here's why:

The passage states that a good tour guide enhances the experience by providing insights into the culture, language, history, and traditions of the place. If a traveler is genuinely interested in the tour and the local history, they will be more receptive to the guide's explanations and insights.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Fa mojanala a beeletsa leeto la mafelo a le mantsi, a bo a bowa gape, go ya go etela toropo ya gaabo** - While a multi-city trip is great, it doesn't directly relate to how a traveler benefits *most* from a tour guide.
*   **C: Fa moeti a kgona go bua sentle, puo ya kwa a etelang teng** -  Language skills are helpful, but not the *most* impactful benefit. A guide can use translation tools.
*   **D: Fa mojanala a etela lefelo le pharologano ya ditso e leng setlwaedi go bone** - Visiting a unique cultural site is wonderful, but the guide's expertise enhances the *understanding* of that site.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka thusang mojanala go tila go swabisiwa fa a etela mafelo a maša?","The correct answer is **A: Go solofela gore dilo di tla tshwana le kwa o tswang teng.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Go tsaya leeto, solofela go re dilo di ka se tshwane le ka fa di leng ka teng kwa """"gae ko o tswang teng""""."" (When you travel, assume things might be the same as they are back home.)
* **The passage warns:**  ""...go tlhoa tsela ya selegae e go dirwang dilo ka yone."" (...to avoid being caught off guard by the local way of doing things.)  This highlights the importance of not assuming things will be the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go ikaelela go leka go ja dijo tse o tla bong o sa di tlwaela** (Assuming you'll try to eat foods you won't be used to) - While trying new foods can be part of the experience, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a way to avoid being caught off guard.
* **C: Go latela melao e e tshwanang le ya mo o tswang teng** (Following laws similar to where you come from) - The passage directly warns *against* this. Laws, customs, and ways of doing things *differ* in other places.
* **D: Tila go dira dipatlisiso pele ka bonno** (Don't do research beforehand) - Research is *exactly* what helps prepare you and avoid being surprised.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso mo temaneng, ke mofuta ofe wa motho o a ka swabang fa a etela lefelo le lengwe?","The correct answer is **B: Mongwe yo o itumelelang phetogo** (Someone who is adaptable to change).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of being prepared for differences in customs, laws, food, etc., when traveling. It warns against expecting things to be the same as at home.  Someone who is adaptable is able to adjust to these changes, while someone who isn't would be more likely to be overwhelmed or uncomfortable.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mongwe yo o ratang dijo tse a sa di tlwaelang** (Someone who likes unusual foods): While trying new foods *can* be part of being adaptable, it's not the core concept.  The passage is about broader cultural adjustments.
* **C: Mongwe yo o sa fetoleng mogopolo** (Someone who doesn't change habits): This is the opposite of what the passage advocates.  Being rigid in habits would hinder adaptation.
* **D: Mongwe yo o kgatlhegelang go ithuta** (Someone who is willing to learn):  Willingness to learn *helps* with adaptation, but the passage emphasizes the *need* to adapt in the first place.  Adaptability is the broader skill.



"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang se o ka se eletseng mojanala yo o etelang naga e e tlhabologang la ntlha ka sone?,"The correct answer is **B: Tila go dirisa madi a mantsi mo dijong malatsi a ntlha a mmalwa.**

Here's why:

The passage describes the challenges of traveling to a new, developing country. One of the key points is the difficulty in adjusting to a new environment, especially when it comes to food.  It specifically mentions that many travelers experience stomach problems due to the unfamiliar cuisine.  

Option B directly addresses this by suggesting limiting the use of food initially.  This is a common and wise precaution when traveling to a new place to avoid digestive issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Itse diphologolo tsa lefelo le o le jetseng nala, pele o robala fa fatshe:** While trying local delicacies can be part of the experience, immediately eating a lot and sleeping on the ground is risky and not recommended.
*   **C: Letloa le le gokelwang mo ditlhareng fa o le mo kampeng:** While appropriate for camping, it doesn't address the general issue of adjusting to the local food.
*   **D: Sekaseka go tšhwina mo dioteleng tsa mafe a a tlhabologileng, tsa maemo a a kwa godimo:** The passage implies that staying in upscale hotels is not always feasible or necessary, and it highlights the challenges of adjusting to a new environment, suggesting a more grounded approach.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang e le sengwe se o ka se ntshetsang madi a a bonalang fa o itlwaetsa naga e nngwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Dijo tsa mekgwa ya kwa dinageng tsa Bophirima (Foods from the Southern countries)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the difficulties and expenses of traveling to exotic and luxurious locations. It mentions expensive hotels, fine dining, and specialized equipment for activities.  However, it specifically highlights the *lack* of something that is often expected when traveling.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Dijo tsa mekgwa ya kwa dinageng tsa Bophirima:** While interesting, food from Southern countries is generally accessible and not considered a unique or expensive element of a luxury travel experience. 
*   **B: Ditirelo tsa boleng:** Health and wellness services *could* be expensive, but the passage doesn't emphasize them as the most lacking element.
*   **C: Materase le mosamo tsa go kampa:** Camping gear is readily available and not necessarily a unique or expensive part of luxurious travel.
*   **D: Diotele tsa mafatshe a a tlhabologileng:** Luxury hotels are mentioned as being *expected* and expensive, not lacking.

The question asks what is *not* something you'd expect to find when traveling to a new country, given the context.  Food is a common expectation, but the passage implies that other, more exclusive things are the ones that are lacking or difficult to obtain.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.



"
Ke dife tsa ditlhopho tse di latelang tse di ka tshwanelang mong wa pholisi yo a batlang khopi ya pholisi fela a ka nna a se nne le inthanete?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa o tsamaya ka lepothopo kgotsa mogala wa letheka wa sefatlhego se se tona, boloka dikhopi mo memoring wa yone kgotsa disike (e kgona go dirisiwa go se na inthanete).**

Here's why:

The question asks what options a police officer *could* use to get a copy of their policy *without* having internet access. Option C directly addresses this by suggesting keeping copies on a wallet memory card or USB drive, which can be accessed offline.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa ba o tsamayang nabo meriti ya pholisi ya gago:** This refers to situations where the officer is *with* the insurance company, not a method of obtaining a copy *without* internet.
*   **B: O ithomele meriti ya tsone ka imeili:**  This requires internet access.
*   **D: Boloka khopi ya gago mo “cloud”:** This requires internet access.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tse di latelang, se se sa tlhokeng go bontshiwa mo pholising?","The correct answer is **D: Aterese ya imeili ya mong wa pholisi**.

Here's why:

The prompt emphasizes needing contact information for the insurance company. While police contact information *might* be useful in a dire situation, it's not a primary requirement for insurance claims.  The focus is on getting in touch with the insurance provider.

* **Aterese ya imeili ya inšorense (Email address of insurance):** This is explicitly stated as needed for communication.
* **Dinomoro tsa boditšhabatšhaba tsa mogala go dira tleleimi (Emergency contact numbers of the lodge for a claim):**  While potentially helpful, it's not a *mandatory* piece of information requested.
* **Dinomore tsa boditšhabatšhaba tsa mogala tsa ditetlelelo (Emergency contact numbers of the lodge for inspections):** Similar to the above, it's useful but not a core requirement for the initial insurance claim process.
* **Aterese ya imeili ya mong wa pholisi (Email address of a police officer):**  This is not directly relevant to filing an insurance claim.  While the police might be involved in an accident, the insurance company is the primary contact.



Therefore, the email address of a police officer is the least important piece of information to show the police.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke selekanyo sefe sa negative e e bontshang mofuta wa filimi o o tlwaetseng go dirisiwa?","The correct answer is **A: Negative ya 6 ka 6 cm**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dikhamera tsa selekanyo se se mo maemong a a fa gare di dirisa selekanyo sa 6cm ka 6cm go tlhomamisa thata e le 56 ka 56mm o o bonalang ka tsela e e farologaneng."" This translates to ""Cameras in those positions use a format of 6cm by 6cm to achieve a high degree of sharpness...""
"
"Ke efe ya mefuta e e latelang, e e farologaneng ya difilimi, e e neelanang ka resolushene e e sa tlhomamang fa e bapiswa le khamera ya gajaana ya dijithale , ya lense e le nngwe?","The correct answer is **A: Filimi ya dimilimitara di le 35**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Filimi tsa go tlwaelegatsa tsa 35 mm (ya negative ya 36 ka 24mm) ke tsone tse di itseweng thata...e naya resolushene e e sa tlhomamang fa e bapisiwa le khamera ya ga jaana ya dijithale ya lense e le nngwe.""  This directly connects 35mm film with lower resolution compared to modern digital cameras.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dikhamera tsa selekanyo se se mo maemong a a fa gare:** The text says these cameras *resolve* better than 35mm film, not worse.
* **C: Filimi ya dimilimitara di le 56 x 56 ya dimilimitara:** The text suggests this film has higher resolution than 35mm.
* **D: Filimi ya disenthimitara di le 6 x 6 ya disentimetara:**  This film type is also known for good resolution.

Therefore, only 35mm film is described as having lower resolution compared to modern digital cameras."
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tla nnang ya bofelo ya go simolola kgwebo ya go kwala ka mosepele?","The correct answer is **C: Itirele webosaete e e leng ya gago.**

Here's why:

The passage outlines a process:

1. **Start with a travel-friendly website:**  This provides a platform to start.
2. **Learn to network and promote online:** This builds your skills.
3. **Build your own website:** This is the final step and the core of having your own business.

Therefore, creating your own website (option C) is the culmination of the steps and the ultimate goal described in the passage. While the other options are steps *towards* that goal, they aren't the final, defining action.
"
"Fa o simolola kgwebo ya go kwala ka mesepele, ke bofe ba bokgoni jo bo latelang, bo o ka bo tokafatsang pele?","The correct answer is **C: Ipaakanyetsa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the initial goal is to **""tokafatsa bokgoni jwa ga go mo webosaeteng e e tlhomilweng ya maeto""** (demonstrate the ability to be on a supported travel website).  This implies you need to be able to *connect* to and *use* an existing platform first.

Here's why the other options are not the *first* step:

* **A: Go bloga (Blogging):** Blogging is a content creation activity and not a fundamental requirement to start selling on a travel website.
* **B: Go rulaganya webosaete (Building a website):**  The passage says you eventually want to build your own website, but that's a later step *after* demonstrating you can work within an existing platform.
* **D: Tlhola webosaete (Testing the website):** Testing comes *after* the website (either an existing platform or your own) is built and functional.

Therefore, **Ipaakanyetsa (Connecting/Registering/Integrating)** to a supported travel website is the necessary first step to fulfill the initial goal outlined in the passage.



"
Mathata a mala a bonwa ka tlwaelo mo maemong afe a bosa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mafelong a a tsididi (Desert regions)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Fela jaaka malwetsi a mafatlha mo mafelong a a tsididi, malwetsi a mala a tlwaelesegile mo mafelong a a molelo mme go le ga ntsi a tena mme a se diphatsa mo go kalo.""  This translates to: ""Just like parasitic diseases in arid regions, enteric diseases are common in moist regions and are abundant and spread upwards.""

Therefore, the passage directly links enteric diseases (malwetsi a mala) to desert regions (mafelong a a tsididi).
"
"Go ya ka temana, ka go bo o rakana le megare ya ko o tswang,masole a mmele wa gago a ka tswa a tiile kgatlhanong le eng?","The correct answer is **A: Mathata a mala (Colored problems)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gape, kwa mafatsheng a a bothitho megare e gola ka bofefo e bile e tshela lebaka le le leele kwa ntle ga mmele. Ka moo go nang le digajaja tsa letsholo la Delhi Belly, the Pharaoh's Curse, le tse dingwe tse dintsi tse di tsamaelanang natso. Fela jaaka malwetsi a mafatlha mo mafelong a a tsididi, malwetsi a mala a tlwaelesegile mo mafelong a a molelo mme go le ga ntsi a tena mme a se diphatsa mo go kalo.""

This translates to: ""Also, in tropical countries, bacteria grow rapidly and live outside the body. There are outbreaks of Delhi Belly, the Pharaoh's Curse, and many others associated with it. Just as parasitic diseases are common in arid regions, colored diseases are common in moist regions and are often transmitted orally.""

The passage directly links ""malwetsi a mala"" (colored diseases) to the possibility of your body's immune system being overwhelmed.  Option A, ""Mathata a mala"" (colored problems), is the closest and most accurate translation of that concept in the context of the passage. While ""Delhi Belly"" is mentioned as an example, it's a specific type of colored disease, not the general category being discussed.

Therefore, **A: Mathata a mala** is the best answer.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e nang le molemo wa go tsamaya mo teng ga kgaolo ya Schengen?,"The correct answer is **B: Boloka madi (Save money)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the Schengen visa saves time, money, and paperwork.**  Option B directly reflects the ""save money"" aspect.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The passage explicitly says the Schengen visa *avoids* applying for visas multiple times.
* **Option C is incorrect:**  The Schengen area allows you to travel freely *within* the area, so you *don't* need to constantly cross many border controls.
* **Option D is incorrect:**  The passage states you *don't* need to show a passport within the Schengen area; the Schengen visa acts as your travel document.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**.
"
Ke eng seo se sa tlholeng se bonwa kwa lebitleng Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **A: Mokgabiso mongwe**.

The passage states: ""Ha e bapisiwa le diphopho tse dingwe, phuphu ya ga Tutankhamun ga e na boleng jwa go etelwa, ka gore e nnye fela thata ebile e na le **mekgabisa e menyee**."" (Compared to other tombs, Tutankhamun's tomb is not worth visiting because it is only difficult and has **many locks**.)

While the passage mentions the head and legs might be visible, the primary reason the tomb is not well-preserved is due to the locks (mekgabiso) making access difficult and leading to damage.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae kwa Vancouver koo go ka se ngokeng bajanala ba ba se nang madi a le mantsi? ","The correct answer is **A: Setlhaketlhake sa Granville**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Batho bano ba reetsang ka kelotlhoko ba fitlhelwa kwa Howe Sound ka fa ntle fela ga Vancouver, mme go motlhofo go e etela ka dipalamo tsa sechaba tsa mo metsing tse di tswang kwa Setlhaketlhakeng sa Granville mo toropokgolong ya Vancouver.""

This translates to: ""Those who come on a whim are taken to Howe Sound just outside of Vancouver, and it's a pleasure to visit the public water gardens from Granville Island in the city of Vancouver.""

The text presents Granville Island as a more affordable option than Bowen Island, Howe Sound, or Whistler.  It specifically highlights the *public water gardens* as a place for casual visits.



Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Tsela ya kwa godimo, kwa lewatleng go ya mankalakaleng a Loapi:** This describes a hiking trail to Loapi Falls, which is more geared towards outdoor enthusiasts, potentially with costs for transportation.
*   **C: Setlhaketlhake sa Bowen:** The text implies Bowen Island is less affordable.
*   **D: Whistler:** Whistler is mentioned as a more expensive destination, known for skiing and the Olympics.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke lefelo lefe, le le ka neelang bajanala, maitemogelo a mmatota a Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Setlhaketlhake sa Bowen**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bowen Island ke mosepele wa letsatsi o o ratiwang thata kgotsa go intsha ga mafelobeke go ya go palama mokorwana wa kaya, go haeka, mabenkele, mafelo a go ja, le tse dingwe tse dintsi.""  This describes Bowen Island as a desirable day trip or getaway near Vancouver.

While Whistler is mentioned for outdoor activities, the question asks for a place *like* Vancouver's ""mmatota"" (which implies a pleasant, relaxing place), and Bowen Island is presented as fitting that description.  Granville Island is mentioned as a public waterfront park *in* Vancouver, but not as a separate destination for a relaxing escape.
"
"Go ya ka temana, bajanala ba tshwanetse ba etele neng Diphororo fa ba batla go bona ba sa kgoreletsege?","The correct answer is **A: Ngwanatsele go fitlha Mopitlwe**.

The passage states: ""Mo pakeng ya dipula (Ngwanatsele go fitlha Mopitlwe), seelo sa metsi se ya kwa godimo mme diphororo di boitshega thata."" This translates to: ""Between the rains (from November to March), the water level rises and the falls are difficult to see.""

Therefore, the best time to visit Victoria Falls to see it at its most impressive is between November and March (the rainy season).
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke molemo wa eng o o bonwang ka go etela Diphororo tsa Victoria magareng ga Ngwanatsele le Mopitlwe?","The correct answer is **C: Go leba go ntse go diragala tse dingwe tse di ngokelang (Seeing other interesting things happening)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that during the rainy season (Ngwanatsele to Mopitlwe), the water levels rise, making it difficult to see the falls clearly. 
* It also mentions that it's dangerous to walk near the falls due to the risk of illness or falling.
* Therefore, the passage implies that the rainy season isn't the best time to *specifically* see the Victoria Falls.  Instead, it suggests that if you visit *between* Ngwanatsele and Mopitlwe, you'll be able to see other interesting things happening in the area because the falls will be less visible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ditebo tse di sa kgorelediweng tsa Diphororo (Unrelated beliefs about the Falls):** The passage doesn't discuss beliefs.
* **B: Bajanala ba palo e e kwa tlase (Fewer tourists):** The passage doesn't mention tourist numbers.
* **D: Go tila setlha sa dipula (Avoiding the rainy season):** The question asks what is *good* about visiting *during* the rainy season, according to the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke sefe sa tse di latelang se se sa kgothaletsweng fa o dirisa drone go gatisa filimi?","The correct answer is **D: Go gatisa filimi mo go tletseng batho moo drone e ka se lemogweng.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Go fofisa drone gaufi le boemafofane kgotsa mo godimo ga batho ba le bantsi ke kakanyo e e sa siamang ka metlha..."" (Flying a drone near people or above large crowds is not a reasonable plan...).

Option D directly relates to this, as filming in crowded areas where the drone might not be noticed is discouraged due to safety and privacy concerns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhola pele gore o letleletswe go gatisa eng:** (Check in advance what is prohibited to film) This is good advice and aligns with responsible drone operation.
*   **B: Go bona ditlankana tse dingwe tsa tetlelelo:** (See other filming locations) This is also a good practice to find suitable locations.
*   **C: Makwalo a tetlelelo ya go batlisisa:** (Filming angles) Considering filming angles is standard practice for good filmmaking.



Therefore, option D is the only one that describes an *unreasonable* or *discouraged* action according to the provided text.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke kae mo go siametseng go gatisa filimi ka tiriso ya drone?","The correct answer is **B: Mo mafelong a go tsaya ditshwantsho go go tlwaelegileng go sa letlelelwang**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go fofisa drone gaufi le boemafofane kgotsa mo godimo ga batho ba le bantsi ke kakanyo e e sa siamang ka metlha..."" which translates to ""Flying a drone near crowds or above large groups of people is an unwise decision...""

Option B, ""Mo mafelong a go tsaya ditshwantsho go go tlwaelegileng go sa letlelelwang"" translates to ""In areas where shoots are typically not allowed."" This aligns with the caution in the passage about not flying near crowds. Areas where shooting is typically restricted are likely places where drone use would also be restricted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gaufi le batho ba bantsi ba ba ka se tshwenggweng ke go nna gone ga drone** - This translates to ""Near large groups of people who are not expecting the drone,"" and directly contradicts the warning against flying near crowds.
*   **C: Mo mafelong a a tlhanaselang foo drone e sa bonagaleng** - This translates to ""In areas where the drone is not visible,"" which isn't a key concern highlighted in the passage.
*   **D: Mo mafelong a o kileng wa bona ditlankana tsa tetlelelo gone** - This translates to ""In areas where you have seen surveillance cameras,"" while drone usage might be restricted near surveillance cameras, it's not directly discussed in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke polelo efe tebang le ditlhokego fa o ikwadisetsa setlankana sa go etela naga e nngwe e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Fa o nna mo mafelong a bajanala, o ka nne wa se tlhoke go ikwadisa.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fa gongwe, ba ba nnang kwa ntle ga mafelo a bojanala ke bone fela ba ba ba tshwanetseng go ikwala."" This directly supports option A. Options B and D are incorrect because the passage explicitly states that not all countries require registration and hotels aren't always responsible for it. Option C is a possible consequence of not registering, but not the reason *why* someone might not need to register.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e seng lefelo le mojanala a ka yang go dira ikwadiso?,"The correct answer is **C: Kantoro ya selegae ya poso (Post office)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that hotels are *typically* the places that handle registration in countries with such laws.  It also mentions that people staying outside of established accommodations are often the ones required to register. A post office wouldn't typically be involved in mandatory travel registration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seteišene sa mapodisi sa selegae (Local police station):**  The passage implies police stations are a place where registration *might* happen, particularly if someone is staying outside a hotel.
*   **B: Hotele e ba nnang mo go yone (Hotel they are staying at):** This is directly mentioned as a common location for registration.
*   **D: Lephata la tsa mesepele (Border control):** Border control is a common place to register upon entering a country.



"
Ke mang a ka se ungwelweng ka go ithaopa o le maetong?,"The correct answer is **A: Mongwe yo o solofelang go kopana le ditsala tse dintšhwa** (Someone who wants to meet new people).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that traveling exposes you to ""batho ba basha"" (new people).  This aligns directly with option A.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Mongwe yo o batlang tuelo e e utlwalang** (Someone who wants a traveling award): While travel *might* lead to awards, it's not the primary or most common motivation mentioned in the text.
* **C: Mongwe a solofetse go bona bokgoni bo bošwa** (Someone who wants to see new skills): While you *can* learn new skills while traveling, the text emphasizes broader experiences, not just skill acquisition.
* **D: Mongwe yo o ka kgatlhegelang bonno le boroko** (Someone who can relax and enjoy life):  Relaxation and enjoyment are *results* of traveling, but not the core motivation for *going* on a trip, according to the text.



"
"Go ya ka temana,go ithaopa o le kwa moseja, go ungwela jang mojanala yo o se nang madi a mantsi?","The correct answer is **B: Go le gantsi, e felela e le ditšhono tsa ditiro.**

Here's why:

The passage describes traveling as a way to earn money by doing odd jobs. Option B directly reflects this by stating that travel often leads to opportunities for temporary work. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Madi a tuelo a tlamelwa (Pocket money is saved):** While you might save *some* money while traveling, the passage focuses on earning money *through* travel.
* **C: Go neelanwa ka lefelo la bonno le boroko ka dinako dingwe (Being sheltered in hostels and cheap lodging at times):** This is a *result* of traveling on a budget, not a primary way to earn money.
* **D: E ka go thusa go leba dilo ka tsela e e farologanyeng (It can help you see things in a different way):** While the passage mentions this benefit, it's not the main point regarding financial aspects of traveling.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka tsewang e le leeto le le tlwaelesegileng la go ya Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Go nna leeto lotlhe ntle le go tswa kwa dikagong tsa Disney.**

Here's why:

The passage states that a typical Walt Disney World trip *includes* staying at a Disney resort, but *also* includes a week-long stay *excluding* the Disney parks. Option C accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go nna beke ntle le go tswa kwa dikagong tsa Disney:** This is only *part* of a typical trip, not the whole thing.
*   **B: Go nna hoteleng e e kwa ntle ga kago:** Staying at a non-Disney hotel is a possibility, but it doesn't define a typical trip.
*   **D: Palama bese go tswa boemafofaneng, go ya hoteleng:** This describes a transportation aspect, not the overall trip.

"
Ke dife tsa dipolelo tseno ka Walt Disney World tse e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: Dithekete tse di ka dirisiwang gantsi di a amogangwa le bajanala**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that while used tickets are commonly sold on websites like eBay and Craigslist, Disney *doesn't* accept them. This means the statement ""Dithekete tse di ka diriswang gantsi di a amogangwa le bajanala"" (Resale tickets are accepted and used) is **false**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go na le lefelo la bonno mo dikagong** (There is a hunting ground in the parks): The passage doesn't mention any hunting grounds.
* **C: Go na le dibese tse di leng gone, go tsamaisa bajanala go tswa kwa lefelong la difofane, go ya kwa kagong** (There are buses, travel from the hotel to the park): This is a true description of how people typically get around at Disney World, and isn't presented as being untrue in the passage.
* **D: Dithekete tse di ka diriswang gantsi, di ka bonwa gantsi mo diwebosaeteng tsa palabalo** (Resale tickets can be seen often on auction websites): This is a true statement according to the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dintlha tse di latelang, e e ka nneng ya se nne gone mo dithutong tsa ikatiso ka fa tshwanelong kgotsa dibuka le dimakasine?","The correct answer is **A: Go iphemela mo sekgweng (Staying alert/vigilant)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions: ""...gantsi go na le go rutwa go dirisa dibetsa."" ( ...there might be instructions to use camouflage/disguise.) and ""...dibuka le dimakasine tse di buang ka go iphemela mo sekgweng di dintsi..."" (...many books and magazines that talk about staying alert/vigilant...).

While the other options might be *related* to safety, they are not directly mentioned as key components of the ""Hostile Environment Course"" as described in the text. The text specifically highlights staying alert/vigilant as an important skill taught.

* **B: Go ipaakanyetsa thusopotlako (Memorization)** is not directly mentioned.
* **C: Go itshiamisetsa lefelo la ntwa (Understanding the terrain)** is implied, but not as a core element specifically detailed in the text.
* **D: Diketšhe (Camouflage/Disguise)** is mentioned in the context of using ""dibetsa"" (camouflage/disguise), but ""go iphemela mo sekgweng"" is a broader concept encompassing vigilance and awareness which is highlighted more prominently.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dithuto tse di latelang, e e ka nneng ya rutwa thata mo ikatiso ka fa tshwanelong?","The correct answer is **C: Go iphemela mo sekgweng (Self-defense)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ithutuntsho ya mohuta o ka gale e go ga malatsi a le 2 go ya go a 5, mme e akaretsa dikeche, kitso e e tseneletseng ka dithuso tsa ntlha mme fa gongwe go na le go re **o ka rutwa go dirisa dibetsa**."" (The training typically lasts 2 to 5 days and includes drills, theoretical knowledge with basic assistance, and sometimes you can be taught to use weapons.)  ""Dibetsa"" translates to self-defense or weapons.

While the other options are mentioned as part of the course, self-defense is the skill that would likely be taught and practiced in a potentially hostile environment.  The phrase ""o ka rutwa go dirisa dibetsa"" directly points to self-defense as a potentially difficult skill to master.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke tlhopho efe e e di gaisang,e o ka tilang metsi a a ka tswang a tlhoka go phephafadiwa ka yone?","The correct answer is **D: Tlhatlhoba metsi gore a ga a na matshosetsi a a kgethegileng** (Treat the water so that it has no harmful microorganisms).

Here's why:

* The passage states that water purification methods vary depending on the level of contamination.  
* It also emphasizes the importance of treating water to remove harmful microorganisms if you are unsure of its safety. 
* Option D directly addresses the core principle of water purification - removing harmful microorganisms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bedisa metsi metsotso e le mmalwa** (Boil water for a few minutes): While boiling is a common purification method, the passage doesn't focus *only* on boiling and mentions various purification methods.  It's a *method*, not the overarching principle.
* **B: Reka metsi a lebotlolo** (Buy bottled water): This is a solution for when you *cannot* purify water, not a method of purification itself.
* **C: Bedisa metsi motsotso o le mongwe** (Boil water for just one minute):  This is likely not long enough to effectively kill harmful microorganisms and is therefore incorrect.



Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the passage's overall message is D.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka batlang se sa kgonagale le fa o le mothumi yo o nang le bokgoni?","The correct answer is **A: Go thuma gaufi le matlapa a fitlhelwang mo lewatleng**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Makhubu a metsi a a elelang ka bonako a a bo a a tswa kwa letshitshing la lewatle, ga ntsi mo matlapeng a fitlhelewang mo lewatleng kgotsa sengwe sa go tshwana le seo."" (Clear water flows from the spring, not from the water that has already flowed through the rocks or something similar).

This means it's impossible to get clear water by collecting it directly from water that has already passed through rocks. The passage goes on to explain why this is difficult and why people struggle with it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go thuma mo metsing a a boteng:** The passage *does* mention collecting water from clear springs, even if it's difficult.
* **C: Go thuma ba itepatepanya le makhubu:** The passage talks about people trying to carry water, but it doesn't say it's impossible for someone with abilities.  The passage focuses on the *difficulty* of carrying water in certain conditions.
* **D: Thuma go dikologa makhubu:** This option is not mentioned in the passage.



"
O tshwanetse go dira eng fa o le mo metsing a a elelang ka lebelo?,"The correct answer is **A: Leka go tswa mo makhubung ka go leba letlhakoreng le lengwe, o bo o thuma jaaka gale, o boela kwa lotshitshing.**

Here's why:

* The provided text describes the dangerous nature of flash floods and how people get caught in them.
* The text explicitly advises: ""Leka go tswa mo makhubung ka go leba letlhakoreng le lengwe, o bo o thuma jaaka gale, o boela kwa lotshitshing."" (Try to escape from the floodwaters by looking for another bank, and then swim to shore, and then return to the original bank).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Thumela ka bonako kgatlhanong le makhubu** (Swim carefully alongside the floodwaters) - This is dangerous and not advised.
* **C: Thuma o lebile tsela e e farologaneng** (Swim towards a different path) - While finding a different path *might* be part of the escape, the text emphasizes looking for another *bank*.
* **D: Thumela kwa boteng** (Swim towards the shore) - While eventually getting to shore is the goal, the text advises escaping the floodwaters *first* by finding another bank.


Therefore, option A accurately reflects the advice given in the text."
"Go ya ka temana,ke lefelo lefe le go etela ntlo ya bogosi, e le leeto la tlosobodutu, go ka ntswelang molemo?","The correct answer is **C: Mo mokgatšheng wa Rhine**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley as good places to visit royal castles.** The question asks for a good place to visit a castle on a two-week trip.
* **The passage also mentions the Danube Valley, but doesn't explicitly highlight it as *the best* place for castle visits.**
* **The Erie Canal is mentioned as a place to take a boat trip, but not primarily for visiting castles.**
* **The passage states that royal castles can be a good place for self-discovery.**

Therefore, the Rhine Valley is the most directly supported option in the passage for a castle-focused trip.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tse di latelang se o ka se eletseng basadi ba ba tsamayang mo lefelong le, go se dira?","The correct answer is **B: Lemoga gore go farologana ga dingwao go ka nne ga rotloetsa maitsholo a e ka reng o a tlhekefadiwa go tswa kwa baaging ba selegae.**

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""Basadi ba tshwanetse go lemoga go re go farologana ga dingwao go ka dira go re ba bone se e kareng ba tlhekefadiwa, e bile go tlwaelesegile go salwa morago, o tshwarwa ka letsogo, jalo jalo."" (Women should be aware that a difference in appearance can make them feel harassed, and it is common to be followed, taken away, etc.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O seke wa tlotla ka maemo a gago a lenyalo:**  The text *warns* against this very behavior.  It's part of what leads to harassment.
* **C: Se rwale palamonwana e e lebegang e le tlhwatlhwa e e kwa godimo thata:** While the text mentions women can use this as a defense, it's not the primary, *essential* thing they should do.  Awareness of the potential for harassment is more fundamental.
* **D: Dirisa bopopota fa go tlhokega:** While using your voice is good, the text doesn't highlight it as the *most* crucial thing women should do when traveling in this region. Awareness and recognizing potential harassment are more important preventative measures.



Therefore, being aware that differences in appearance can be used as a pretext for harassment is the most crucial and recommended action for women traveling in this region, according to the text.



"
"Go ya ka lefelo le le tlhalositsweng mo temaneng,o ka eletsa bajanala ba basadi jang?","The correct answer is **A: Lemoga gore ga go a tlwaelega go salwa morago.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Go tlwaelesegile go salwa morago"" which translates to ""It is customary to be abandoned."" The question asks how to advise women based on the provided text. Therefore, the most relevant advice is to understand that being abandoned is not unusual.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Rwala palamonwana e kgolo go supa gore o nyetswe** - While making a loud noise might help, the passage's primary focus is on the societal acceptance of abandonment.
* **C: Tlhaloganya gore pharologano ya ditso e tsitsinya gore o tile go ikemela** -  This option focuses on body language and independence, which are important but not as directly addressed as the societal norm of abandonment.
* **D: Tlhomama fa o gana banna, mme o ikemele, fa ba go kopa lerato** - This is good advice, but the question asks for advice *based on the provided text*. The text emphasizes the acceptance of abandonment more strongly than the importance of refusing unwanted advances.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke seemo sefe se se ka tlhokang gore motsayaditshwantsho wa diphologolo a dirise lense ya taolabogolo, e telele?","The correct answer is **A: Fa ba tshwantsha,segolobogolo,ditshedi tse di nnye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go tsaya ditshwantsho tsa diphologolo tsa naga go tlhoka lense ya taolabogolo e telele; fela dilo di tshwana le letsomane la dinonyane kgotsa setshedi se se nnye se tlhoka lense tse dingwe."" (Creating maps requires a long-range lens; it's just like a small magnifying glass or a single telescope needing others.)

This directly connects the need for a long-range lens with viewing distant objects like mountains, telescopes, and single scopes.  The other options are either irrelevant or mentioned as *reasons* for map-making, not as *triggers* for needing a long-range lens.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang e ka nna kgwetlho go batsayaditshwantsho ba diphologolo?","The correct answer is **A: Go bona diphologolo tse dingwe tse di sa tlwaelegang**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Go thata go bona diphologolo tse dintsi tse di sa tlwaelegang..."" (It's difficult to see many unusual patterns...).  This directly connects the difficulty of seeing unusual patterns to the act of pattern recognition.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Diphologolo tse di tlhaga di na le dikgoka:** While true, this describes a characteristic of *some* patterns, not the *difficulty* of recognizing patterns in general.
* **C: Go bona mofuta wa lense o o tlhokegang:** This describes a tool needed for pattern recognition, not a characteristic of patterns themselves or the difficulty in recognizing them.
* **D: Go dira mo seemong se se tletseng letlhoo:** This describes a characteristic of the *semo* (texture), not the patterns themselves.

Therefore, option A is the only one that directly relates to the difficulty described in the passage about pattern recognition.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e ka bakang mathata a a seng mantsi go mokgweetsi yo a tsamayang go ralala dithaba?","The correct answer is **C: Go wa ga marothodi ka bontsi (Flooding)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Mo letlhakoreng le lengwe, kapoko le go gatsela ga metsi mo ditseleng ke selo se se tlwaelesegileng mo mafatsheng a mantsi, ka jalo bokete jwa dikoloi mo tseleng bo tsamaya fela bo sa fetoge ngwaga otlhe."" This means flooding is a common problem.
* **The text highlights the danger of flash floods:**  It says, ""Mo ditseleng tse di gatsetseng, di wetswe ke kapoko, maotwana a dikoloi ga a kgone go itsetsepela, ka jalo ga o kake wa kgweetsa okare o kgweetsa fa godimo ga sekonotere fela. Go bona go ka kgoreletsega ka go wa kgotsa go bodulwa ga semathana kgotsa ka marothodi a pula kgotsa serame mo matlhabaphefong a sejanaga.""  This emphasizes the extreme danger of flash floods, causing vehicles to become stranded.
* **The other options are less impactful:**
    * **A: Bokete jwa dikoloi (Vehicle congestion):**  While frustrating, congestion is not as immediately dangerous as a flash flood.
    * **B: Ga a kgone go itsetsepela (Lack of maneuverability):**  Lack of maneuverability can contribute to problems, but flooding *directly* causes vehicles to be stranded.
    * **D: Go bona mo go kgoreletsegileng (Poor visibility):**  Poor visibility is a factor in driving, but flooding is a more immediate and widespread danger.

Therefore, **flooding (Go wa ga marothodi ka bontsi)** poses the most significant threat to a driver navigating mountainous roads.
"
Ke eng se se ka nnang sa se fetoge ka lekgetho la letseno go ralala dinaga tse di farologaneng?,"The correct answer is **D: Seelo (Bracket)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Seelo sa lotseno le dituelo (tax bracket) di farologana thata go tswa mo nageng e nngwe go ya kwa go e nngwe."" (Tax brackets are difficult to transfer from one country to another.)

This indicates that the **tax bracket** (seelo) is the aspect of income tax that varies significantly between countries. The other options don't directly address the difficulty of transferring tax systems:

* **A: Dikelo (Rates):** While tax rates are important, the passage focuses on the *brackets* themselves.
* **B: Le agilwe (Levied):**  The method of levying taxes (how they're collected) can vary, but isn't the core issue described.
* **C: Koo o kwadisang teng (Where you earn):**  While where you earn affects your tax obligations, the main point is the difficulty of transferring the *bracket system*.



Therefore, the passage is specifically highlighting the variability of **tax brackets (seelo)** across different countries.



"
"Go ya ka temana , fa o dira kwa moseja, mme o nna golo gongwe, ke kae moo o ka nneng wa kwadisa lekgetho la letseno teng?","The correct answer is **C: mo nageng e o dirang go yone gajaana**.

Here's why:

The passage states that income tax systems vary greatly between countries and that tax brackets are difficult to transfer from one country to another. It also mentions that in countries like the US and Canada, tax brackets are calculated on a national level.

Therefore, if you are working abroad, you are subject to the income tax laws of the country where you are working.
"
"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo, Dipontsho tsa Lefatshe?","The correct answer is **B: Dipontsho tsa temo di diriwa gammogo le ditshupetso tsa botaki le dithuto.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Dipontsho tsa Lefatshe (tse ga ntsi di bidiwang World Exposition, kgotsa fela Expo) ke moletlo o mogolo wa bodichabachaba wa botaki le maranyane. Dinaga di dira ditshupetso tsa botaki le dithuto mo pavilion ya naga..."" This indicates that World Expos involve both trade and exhibits.
*   The passage *specifically* says ""Dipontsho tsa Bodichabachaba tsa Temo ke ditiragalo tse di kgethegileng tse di bontshang dithunya, ditshingwaga tsa temo le sepe fela se se amanang le dijalo."" This shows that themed expositions *are* a part of the World Expos, and they include exhibits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dipontsho di ka nne tsa bontsha ka fa dilo di dirwang ka teng mo ditsong tsa one:** While this is *true* of World Expos in general, it's not a unique or particularly *unexplained* characteristic. The passage mentions trade pavilions.
*   **C: Meletlo e ka tsaya dikgwedi di le thataro:** The passage states the event lasts ""gantsi e tsaya lobaka lwa dikgwedi tse tharo go fitlha go tse thataro,"" meaning it *can* last up to three months. This is not something that is unexplained.
*   **D: Dinaga ga di tlhoke go tsaya karolo:** The passage clearly states ""Dinaga di dira ditshupetso tsa botaki le dithuto mo pavilion ya naga,"" meaning countries *do* participate.

Therefore, option **B** is the only statement that, while not necessarily *unexplained*, presents a characteristic of World Expos that isn't directly mentioned in a way that implies it's not a fundamental aspect. The passage presents both Trade and Themed Exhibits as features of World Expos."
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e leng molawana wa Dipontsho tsa Lefatshe kgotsa Dipontsho tsa Bodichabachaba ?","The correct answer is **A: Ditshupetso di tshwanetse go supa ka fa dilo di dirwang ka teng mo nageng gammogo le dikgwetlho tsa lefatshe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dinaga di dira ditshupetso tsa botaki le dithuto mo pavilion ya naga, go supa dikgwetlho tsa lefatshe, le ka fa dilo di dirwang ka teng mo ditsong tsa one."" This directly aligns with option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ga go naga e le nngwe e e ka tshwarang meletlo ngwaga le ngwaga:** The passage says they *don't* happen every year (except in specific locations).
* **C: Ditiragalo di tshwanetse go tsaya dikgwedi di le thataro:** The passage says they typically last 3 to 4 months.
* **D: Gore go tshwarwe dipontsho, dinaga tsotlhe di tshwanetse go tsaya karolo:** While many countries participate, the passage doesn't state that *all* countries *must* participate.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate description of a World's Fair/International Exposition based on the provided text.
"
"Go dira dife tsa tse di latelang, go ka batla go fokotsa kgonagalo ya tlhaselo ka diphologolo?","The correct answer is **B: Go tlosa matlakala mo kampeng (Removing the rubbish from the camp)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Menkgo e ngoka dibera le diphologolo tse dingwe tsa naga, ka jalo tila go tshola kgotsa go apaya dijo tse di nang le menkgo mme o boloke kampa e le phepa."" (Rubbish attracts insects and other wild animals, so there's a risk of theft or feeding them and keeping the camp clean.)

* **Removing rubbish eliminates the attractant.** By keeping the camp clean and free of rubbish, you reduce the likelihood of attracting animals that might steal food or cause problems.

Let's look at why the other options are less effective:

* **A: Go tshola dijtlhatshana tse di nang le monkgo (Collecting fruits with seeds):** While minimizing seed dispersal is good, it doesn't directly reduce animal attraction. Animals are attracted to the *food source*, not just the seeds.
* **C: Go tshola sekgala sa dijarata di le 25 go tswa kwa diphiring (Collecting a 25-meter strip of rubbish from the bushes):** This is helpful, but removing *all* rubbish from the camp is more comprehensive.
* **D: Ba seka ba di fa dijo (Don't feed them):**  The passage already implies this by mentioning the risk of feeding animals. However, simply *not feeding* them doesn't eliminate the attractant if the rubbish is still present.

Therefore, the most effective action to reduce animal attraction is to remove the rubbish from the camp.

"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang mo temaneng jaaka se se ka bakang ditlhaselo ka diphologolo tsa naga","The correct answer is **A: Menkgo e e bogale**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ela tlhoko go re menkgo e ngoka dibera le diphologolo tse dingwe tsa naga, ka jalo tila go tshola kgotsa go apaya dijo tse di nang le menkgo mme o boloke kampa e le phepa."" (Pay attention to the fact that bark attracts berries and other wild animals, so there is a risk of eating them or giving them food that has bark and keeping the husk as feed). This means bark is a known attractant for animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go retelelwa ke go emela kgakala le tsone:** This refers to the fact that animals are attracted to the smell of feces, not a direct cause of attracting berries and bark.
* **C: Go fepa diphologolo tsa naga:** While possibly true in some instances, the text doesn't emphasize this as a major cause of attracting animals. It focuses more on the bark.
* **D: Diphologolo tse di sa tlwaelang batho:** The text states that even animals that don't normally approach humans can be attracted.

Therefore, **menkgo e e bogale (bark)** is the most directly linked cause of attracting animals according to the provided text."
