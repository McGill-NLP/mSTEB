"Ko marãnduhai he’iháicha, mbaʼépa noñekonsidéramoʼãi peteĩ konsého oñembopu porã hag̃ua pe acordeón?","The correct answer is **A: Hatãve ipu hag̃ua, hatãve avei ejopyva’erã umi tecla** (Press the buttons, and also pump the bellows).

Here's why:

The question asks about advice for playing the accordion well, referencing the initial text which mentions pressing buttons and pumping the bellows. Option A directly reflects this key element of accordion playing.  

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ani eñemongu'eparei ikatu hag̃uáicha nekyre'ỹve** (Don't neglect your posture like your back): While good posture is important, it's not the *primary* advice related to the *act of playing* the accordion, as highlighted in the initial text.
* **C: Epove aja umi nota eñeha'ã topytu'u nde po** (The notes are played as if by your fingers): This is a description of *how* the notes are produced, not advice on *how to play* them well.
* **D: Ejopy pya'eve pe fuelle ikatu hag̃uáicha ipu hatãve** (Pump the bellows quickly as if pressing the buttons):  While pumping the bellows is necessary, focusing *only* on speed isn't good advice.  The bellows pump needs to be coordinated with the button/key pressing.



"
"Embopu aja acordeón, mávapa koʼãva apytégui neipytyvõta ipu hag̃ua hatãve?","The correct answer is **A: Pya'eve** (Immediately).

Here's why:

The question asks how the bellows *help* you play the buttons on an accordion. The text states: ""Acordeón-pe, oñembopu hatãve hag̃ua ojejopy hatã térã pya’eve fuelle."" This translates to: ""On the accordion, when you press the buttons, you either press them or immediately operate the bellows.""

Therefore, the bellows provide the immediate air pressure needed to activate the buttons.

Mba'ére umi ta'ãnga ryrýi oĩva ta'ãngambyrype oñeikytĩ ijerepe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojehecha porã hag̃ua umi taíkuéra (To clearly display the frames)**.

Here's why:

The text explains that the DVD uses ""ijykekuéra ñeikytĩ"" (frame interlacing) to display video. Frame interlacing is a technique where each frame is split into two fields, and these fields are displayed alternately. This creates the illusion of a smoother image, especially with fast-moving scenes.  The purpose is to *clearly display the frames*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Upéicharõ pe ta'ãnga ryrýi omyenyhẽ pe ta'ãngambyry (Because the frame rate saves the video)** - While frame rate *is* important for video, the text doesn't say it's *saving* the video.  The primary purpose of interlacing isn't to save space.
* **C: Oñemoambue hag̃ua ambue formato-pe (To convert to another format)** - The text doesn't mention format conversion.
* **D: Oikytĩ hag̃ua umi tai hi’aguĩetereíva iguygui (To combine high-resolution frames)** - Interlacing doesn't combine high-resolution frames. It uses a specific display method.

"Ko maranduhai rupive, mávapa ha'e mba'e hasyvéva ikatu ojetopa embohasa hag̃ua ta'ãngamýi DVD-pe?","The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ ta'ãnga omyenyhẽva pe ta'ãngambyry** (A device that ejects the disc).

Here's why:

The question asks what is the ""problem"" that allows the disc to be inserted into the DVD player. The passage describes a problem where the disc isn't being correctly inserted, leading to distorted video. The text states that the ""problem"" is that a device is ""ejecting the disc"" (oñembohasa haguã ta'ãngamýi), meaning it's being ejected and then re-inserted incorrectly, causing the distortion.  Option C directly states this problem: ""A device that ejects the disc.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tai oñeikytĩva mbytépe** (It's inserted upside down): While this *could* cause problems, the passage doesn't describe this as the primary problem. It focuses on the disc being ejected and re-inserted incorrectly.
* **B: Opaha oñeikytĩva** (The lens is inserted): This isn't the problem. A correctly inserted lens is essential for reading the disc.
* **D: Opaha oñeikytĩva** (The speaker is inserted): The speaker has nothing to do with the problem of the disc not being properly inserted and the video being distorted.



"
Moõ tepa guarnición británica oĩva’ekue?,"The correct answer is **A: Assunpink Creek-pe**.

The text states: ""General Cadwalde opoíta kuri peteĩ ataque oporombotavýtava guarnición británica **rovaque**..."" which means ""General Cadwalde launched an attack to overwhelm the British garrison **nearby**...""  The subsequent sentence says General Ewing used militia to block the bridge *on* Assunpink Creek. Therefore, the British garrison was located near Assunpink Creek.
"
Máva teraguapy osẽ pe manuscrito borrado-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The text states: ""Peteĩ ogueraha kuri George Wasington 6 jasykõiramo, oñemoñe'ẽ va'ekue tropa-kuérape Nueva York-pe 9 jasykõime. Peteĩ copia oguahẽ kuri 10 jasyapýpe. Umi 25 andanada Dunlap mba'éva ojeikuaáva gueteri hína kuatia copia itujavéva oñeñongatúva."" This translates to: ""One copy was sent by George Washington on the 6th of July, informing the troops in New York on the 9th of July. One copy arrived on the 10th of July. These 25 Dunlap editions were the first copies of the printed document.""

Therefore, John Dunlap is the one who printed the copies of the manuscript.
"
"Ko'ã tenda apytégui, moõpa og̃uahẽ ipahaitépe peteĩ andanada Dunlap-pegua?","The correct answer is **A: Nueva York-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Copia original manuscrita ndojeguerekovéima. Peteĩ copia oguahẽ kuri 10 jasyapýpe."" (The original manuscript is not recoverable. One copy went to New York on the 10th of July.)  Since the ""Dunlap andanada-ramo"" (Dunlap printing) refers to the first official printing, and it's mentioned that a copy went to New York on the 10th of July, that is where the first copies of the Dunlap printing went. 

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
Moõpa oñemohenda raka'e Coronel Stark tropa-kuéra?,"The correct answer is **A: Norte apýra gotyo, cerca pukukuépe**.

The passage states: ""Stark ñorairõharakuéra oñemohenda kuri pe cerca pukukuépe pe Colono-kuéra renda norte apýra gotyo Marea baja ojapóramo petei brecha ysyry Mystic pukukuépe península norte gotyogua pukukuére...""

This translates to: ""Stark's orders were to secure the fence on the northern side, where a breach in the Mystic River fence would be made at low tide to the northern part of the peninsula...""

Therefore, the answer is that Colonel Stark ordered the troops to secure the fence on the northern side.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, araka'épa Stark tropa-kuéra omyasãi ikorakuéra?","The correct answer is **C: Marea baja jave**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Stark ñorairõharakuéra oñemohenda kuri pe cerca pukukuépe pe Colono-kuéra renda norte apýra gotyo Marea baja ojapóramo petei brecha ysyry Mystic pukukuépe península norte gotyogua pukukuére...""  This translates to ""...Stark's instructions were to mend the fence near the northern end of the colonists' land, when the low tide made a breach in the Mystic River...""  This indicates the colonists repaired the fence *when the tide was low*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Colono-kuéra ojerure aja pytyvõ (When the colonists offered help):** While the colonists offered help, the passage doesn't say *when* they offered it. It specifies *when* they repaired the fence.
*   **B: Regular-kuéra ohasa rire pe estaca (When the regulars passed the stake):**  The stake was used to prevent the regulars from passing.  The repair happened *before* the regulars could pass.
*   **D: Umi tropa-kuéra omombarete jave pe tenda oĩhápe (When the troops had worked hard enough to build the fence):** The passage doesn't mention how much work the troops had done. It focuses on the timing related to the tide.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ha’e peteĩ umi ára iviolento-véva China-pegua?","The correct answer is **D: Tres Reino época**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the Three Kingdoms period (Tres Reino) was a time of great instability, warfare, and many deaths, including battles around the Xi'an area.
* The text contrasts the Three Kingdoms period with the Han and Jin dynasties, implying the Three Kingdoms era was the most violent.
* Option B, ""Xi'an época"", refers to a specific location (Xi'an) and isn't a period itself. While Xi'an was a key location during the Three Kingdoms period, it doesn't represent the entire violent era.

Therefore, the Three Kingdoms period is the period described as the most violent in the provided text.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa oiko peteĩ tahyi aty ejército rehere oikundaha aja?","The correct answer is **C: Oñembohupa ha oguerova hikuái 17 ára rire.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko mba'e oiko sapy'a ha ñeikundaha ikatu hi'are 17 ára."" which translates to ""This process takes approximately 17 days."" 
It also mentions the army is ""oñembohupa sapy'a ha oguerova ára ha ára,"" which means ""is being disposed of and moved day by day."" 

Option C directly reflects both of these points, indicating that the process involves both disposal and movement over a period of 17 days.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oñembohupa hikuái pyharekue** (Disposed of in a small quantity): While part of the process, it doesn't fully describe the overall situation.
*   **B: Sa'ive hembi'u hikuái** (Initially a small amount of crime): This is irrelevant to the description of the army's actions.
*   **D: Oguata hikuái arakuépe** (Moved in the streets):  While the army moves in the streets, it doesn't capture the entire process of disposal and movement over a specific timeframe.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba’e mombe'u ko'ã apytégui ohechauka porã mba’eichaitépa umi tahýi aty ejército ojepokuaa jehupapope oikundaha aja?","The correct answer is **C: Oguerova hikuái ihupa ára ha ára**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tahyikuéra aty oñembohupa sapy'a ha oguerova ára ha ára."" This translates to ""The army group is shelling and firing day by day.""  This directly indicates that they are shelling continuously, day after day.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñembohupa hikuái pyharekue (Shelling only a few times):** The text says they are shelling ""day by day,"" not just a few times.
* **B: Oikundaha hikuái 17 ára opytu'uỹme (Shelling only 17 days during the day):** The text doesn't specify a limited time frame of 17 days. It implies ongoing shelling.
* **D: Oiporu hikuái hupakuéra oguerova'ỹme hi'are aja ñeikundaha (They select a certain time to fire during the day):** The text doesn't mention selecting a specific time. It just says they fire ""day by day.""



"
Mávapa ko'ã apytégui oikota jepénte oĩramo okapegua apañuãi?,"The correct answer is **C: Reloj biológico (Biological clock)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Reloj biológico oikóva ijeheguireínte ha oikove aréta jepéramo ndaipóri okápegua apañuãi."" This translates to ""The biological clock is always working and never stops working.""  This directly addresses the question of what allows the body to maintain a regular cycle even when external cues are absent.  The biological clock is the mechanism responsible for this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ciclo endógeno (Endogenous cycle):** This is a broad term referring to internal cycles, but it's not the specific mechanism responsible for maintaining regular cycles despite the absence of external cues.
* **B: Ritmo jepivegua (Circadian rhythm):**  Circadian rhythms are *part of* the biological clock's function, but the clock *is* the overarching system. The question asks what *allows* the cycle to continue, which is the clock itself.
* **D: Ritmo ojekuaáva (Known rhythm):** This is a generic term and doesn't refer to the specific internal mechanism responsible for the cycle's persistence.



"
Mba'e término-pa omombe'u umi individuo-kuéra ohechaukávo oguerekoha rasgo fenotípico?,"The correct answer is **D: Polimórfico**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""Umi individuo-kuéra ohechaukávo oguerekoha hetamba'e imba'eva añónte ojehero hína polimórfico.""  This translates to: ""When individuals are observed to have different phenotypes in the same environment, they are called polymorphic.""

Therefore, **polimórfico** is the term that describes individuals exhibiting different phenotypes.
"
Mávapa ko'ã apyra apytépe oje'éva hína umi organismo oikóva peteĩ tenda imba'eteévape?,"The correct answer is **D: Polimórfico**.

Here's why:

The question describes organisms within a species living in a heterogeneous environment. It states that individuals *within the same group* show different phenotypic traits when exposed to environmental variation. This is the definition of **polymorphism**.

* **Monomorphic** refers to a situation where all individuals within a species have the same phenotype.
* **Atýpegua (Group)** is too general and doesn't describe the phenotypic variation.
* **Especie (Species)** refers to the entire group of organisms, not the phenotypic variation within that group.



"
Mávapa ko'ã mba'e apytépe ndaha'éiva'erã peteĩ techapyrã turismo oñemopyendáva tekoha rehegua?,"The correct answer is **D: Pesca (Fishing)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ecotourism focused on observing nature, wildlife, and ecosystems, often including activities like:

*   Hunting (caza)
*   Fishing (pesca)
*   Photography
*   Birdwatching (guyra jehecha)
*   Nature and ecosystem education/interpretation

While fishing *can* be part of ecotourism, the passage explicitly states that ecotourism includes observing animals and ecosystems.  The other options fit this description:

*   **A: Jeguata peteĩ ytu peve (Jungle trekking)** is a common ecotourism activity.
*   **B: Yvoty ka'aguy ta'ãnga ñeguenohẽ (Rainforest conservation)** is directly related to the preservation of the environment, a core aspect of ecotourism.
*   **C: Museo ciencia rehegua jeike (Science museum education)** can be part of ecotourism, providing context and knowledge about the natural world.

**Fishing (pesca)**, while a natural activity, doesn't inherently focus on the observation and understanding of ecosystems in the same way the other options do. It can be a resource extraction activity and doesn't emphasize the conservation aspect as strongly.

Therefore, fishing is the least aligned with the description of ecotourism in the passage."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytépe oñemopyenda pe sistema mba'yrumýi rehegua?","The correct answer is **C: Biósfera estado opytávape**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes how the development of fire allowed humans to travel further, work with others, and spread. This led to a new state of the biosphere, one where humans could impact the environment significantly.
* The passage explicitly states: ""Ko mba'yrumýi oku'évape, opavave ojoaju ha oykeko peteĩ mba'yrumýi ñemohendaporã oñemopyendáva mba'yrumỹi ijara teévape. Tembikuaa ko'ag̃a he'i ko carbono jeporu sa'ive, omboyke biosfera-pe peteĩ estado opytámavape oykeko mbaretéva evolución humana ko mokõi millón ary ohasáva.""  This translates to: ""With the advent of fire, humans took the lead and created a significant transformation of the environment, which is revealed by the carbon signature, bringing the biosphere to a state of being remarkably different with the two million years of human evolution.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mba'apohápe (By work):** While work was involved, the key transformation wasn't *just* work, but the impact on the environment *caused* by the ability to manipulate it (through fire).
* **B: Mba'yrumýi ijara teéva (Through fire):**  Fire *was* the catalyst, but the passage emphasizes the *result* of fire – the transformation of the biosphere.
* **D: Evolución humana (Human evolution):** Evolution is the *process*, and the passage describes a significant *shift* in the biosphere *caused* by a change in human capabilities, not evolution itself.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the biosphere was transformed to a new state.



"
"Umi partícula ojeréva núcleo rehe, mba'éichagua carga oguereko?","The correct answer is **D: Carga positivo-va ha negativo-va**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Protón-kuéra oguereko peteĩ carga eléctrica positivo-va ha katu neutrón-kuéra ndoguerekói carga."" (Protons have a positive electric charge, and neutrons do not have a charge.)
* It also states: ""Electrón-kuéra oguereko carga eléctrica negativo-va."" (Electrons have a negative electric charge.)

Therefore, the nucleus contains protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge), while electrons (which orbit the nucleus) have a negative charge.
"
Mba'e partícula oreko umi núcleo-kuéra?,"The correct answer is **A: Protón ha neutrón-kuéra**

The text states: ""Nucleo oguereko mokõi partícula: neutrón ha protón-kuéra."" which translates to ""The nucleus contains two particles: neutrons and protons.""
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ikatu ha'e papapy binario orekóva po bit?","The question asks how many bits are in the binary number 1010.

A bit is a binary digit, which is either 0 or 1. To find the number of bits, we simply count the number of digits in the binary number.

The binary number 1010 has four digits: 1, 0, 1, and 0.

Therefore, the number of bits in the binary number 1010 is 4.

Now let's check the options:
A: 1010 - has 4 digits.
B: 12001 - has 5 digits.
C: 10010 - has 5 digits.
D: 110101 - has 6 digits.

The correct answer is A: 1010, which has 4 bits.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{A}$"
Papapy binario mba'éicha avei ojeikuaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ha ko'ã papapy ojeikuaa papapy binario-ramo, térã **bits**, ojeiporu haguã peteĩ jerga informática.""  This translates to ""and these papers are known as binary papers, or **bits**, which are used as an informatics jargon.""

Therefore, ""bits"" is the term used for binary papers.

"Ko'ã apytépe, máva ndojemombe'úgui ko maranduhaipe beneficio primario ramo umi oñemotemimbo'évape blogs-pe?","The correct answer is **C: Jeikuaave umi mba’e jere rehegua (To show things related to the subject)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that blogs are used to ""omyaña temimbo’ekuérape oikuaave hag̃ua umi mba’e ijere rehegua"" (to show things related to the subject).  The primary benefit highlighted is the ability to share information and perspectives on various topics.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Oñemomorãve gramática ha jehaipy (Improving grammar and spelling):** While important, this is presented as a *starting point* and not the *primary* benefit.
* **B: Sa'ive crítica tapichágui (Social criticism by people):**  The text mentions the possibility of social criticism but doesn't frame it as the main benefit.
* **D: Ñemongyre’ỹ ojeipysove hag̃ua jeikuaapy (Facilitating knowledge sharing):**  While knowledge sharing is a consequence of blogs, the core function described is the *display* of information, not just facilitation.



Therefore, **C** best captures the central purpose and benefit of blogs according to the provided text.



"
Máva ko'ã apytépe blog rehegua ha'e temimbo'ekuérape omongyre'ỹva omomorãve hag̃ua ijehaipy?,"The correct answer is **B: Audiencia crítica rupi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Umi temimbo’ekuéra ha’e rupi audiencia crítica, blog ohaíva oñepyrũ oñeha’ã omomorãvévo ijehaipy."" This translates to: ""These elements are the critical audience, the blog that starts aiming to promote itself.""  

The passage emphasizes that blogs are designed to engage a critical audience and gain visibility. While the other options touch upon aspects of blogs, the core purpose described is to cultivate a critical audience.
"
Mávapa ko'ã apytégui ndaha'éi beneficio comunicación asíncrona temimbo'ekuérape? ,"The correct answer is **C: Sa’ive ojehapejoko arange, oguereko posibilidad omba’apóvo** (It can be sent asynchronously, offering the possibility of responding).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that asynchronous communication allows for messages to be sent and responded to at different times. This is a core benefit highlighted in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Internet jeporu marandu topa hag̃ua** (The internet allows you to receive messages) - While true, this is a general benefit of the internet, not specific to asynchronous communication.
* **B: Jojehechahápe instructor-ndive taha’e ha’éva aravópe** (Being able to contact the instructor outside of office hours) - This is a *result* of asynchronous communication, but not the main *benefit* of the communication method itself. It's a consequence of the flexibility.
* **D: Ritmo imba'évape** (At your own pace) - This is *part* of the benefit, but option C encompasses it more fully by mentioning the ability to respond asynchronously.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã comunicación asíncrona rehegua apytégui ndaha'éi temimbo'ekuérapeguarã?","The correct answer is **A: Ñemoarandu ritmo (Information rhythm)**.

Here's why:

The text highlights that asynchronous communication allows for information to be shared and received at different times, not necessarily in real-time.  This emphasizes the **rhythm of information exchange** – it's not dictated by a synchronous, immediate flow.  

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ñemba'apo ritmo (Work rhythm):** While asynchronous communication can *influence* work rhythm, it isn't the core defining characteristic.  It's more about the timing of the interaction.
* **C: Marandu oporohekombo’éva (Deferred communication):** This is a consequence of asynchronous communication, but not the defining characteristic itself.  It describes *what* happens, not *how* it happens.
* **D: Internet jeporu (Internet access):**  Internet access *enables* asynchronous communication, but it's not the communication style itself.  The text focuses on the *style* of communication.



"
Mba’épa noñeñe’ẽi ko maranduhaipe ikatúva ojoaju castillo medieval rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Mazmorra (Dungeon)**.

The text mentions ""ñahetũ pe kyhyje ry'akuã osẽva mazmorra guive"" which translates to ""we fight the fire dragon that comes from the dungeon.""  This makes ""mazmorra"" the option that is specifically mentioned in the text.



Here's a breakdown of why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Justa-kuéra (Tournaments)**: While knights might participate in tournaments, the text doesn't mention them.
*   **C: Caballería (Chivalry)**: The text mentions knights and chivalry, but doesn't focus on the concept of chivalry itself.
*   **D: Caballero-kuéra (Knights)**: The text mentions knights (""omomagiavo umi caballero kuéra"") but the ""dungeon"" is a more specific element discussed.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui noñeñe’ẽi pe maranduhaipe ha’eva peteĩ mba’e ty'akuã téra tyapu ikatúva ojemomagiavo castillo rembyrépe?,"The correct answer is **B: Kyhyje**.

Here's why:

The question asks what ""powerful thing"" can be used to magically control the castle's defenses. The text mentions:

*   **""Umi óga guasu rembyre su ary oguerekóva apytépe ndahasýi jagueru hag̃ua ñane akãme umi tyapu ha ty'akuã umi ñorãirõ oikova'ekue...""** (The great houses at the top of the castle protect us from the arrows and projectiles that are shot at us...)
*   **""...avei ñahendúvaicha umi kavaju py ryapu tapehũ rehe ha ñahetũ pe kyhyje ry'akuã osẽva mazmorra guive.""** (...and we also know about the catapults and launch the **ballista** from the dungeon.)

A ballista (kyhyje in Guarani) is a powerful, crossbow-like siege engine used to launch large bolts or stones. It fits the description of a ""powerful thing"" capable of magically controlling the castle's defenses (i.e., attacking enemies).

Therefore, the answer is **Kyhyje (Ballista)**.



"
Mávapa ko'ã apytégui ha'e añete techaukaha Kirby Muxloe Castle rehegua?,"The correct answer is **B: Oikotevẽva’ekue sa'i ñangareko oñemopu'ãramoguare pe tetãme ojeiko rupi py'aguapype.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""1480 década-pe, Lord Hasting oñepyrũramo guare omopu’ã, ko tetã oiko va’ekue py’aguapýpe nunga ha tekotevẽ va’ekue oñeñangareko tapicha rekovai sapy’agua aty’i mimi rehe añónte.""  This translates to: ""In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began to build it, this castle was built on a hill and was intended to defend against attacks by a large army.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lord Hastings omoñepyrũka castillo agyke poguasuva:** While it's true Lord Hastings initiated the construction, the text emphasizes the *location* (on a hill) and *purpose* (defense) more than the grandeur of the castle itself.
* **C: Pe castillo ñemopu'ã ndaha'éiva'ekue típico upe época-pe g̃uarã:** The text *doesn't* say the castle was atypical for its time. It highlights its strategic placement on a hill.
* **D: Oñemopu'ã kuri ombohovake are hag̃ua ataque-kuéra:**  While defense *is* a purpose, the text explicitly mentions the castle was built on a hill to *defend against attacks*. Option B is more precise in reflecting the castle's reason for existence.



Therefore, option **B** is the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the text.



"
Mávapa ko'ã apytégui ndaha'éichene Kirby Muxloe castillo reheguaite ko moranduhai rupive?,"The correct answer is **B: Peteĩ pyenda oñemopu'ãva ombohovake hag̃ua ataque** (A defensive tower built to ward off attacks).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hovetã tuichaicha cristal reheve ha hogyke pererĩ ndaikatumo’ãi kuri ombohovake are peteĩ ataque."" This translates to: ""It is very high with crystal and has a tower that can defend against an attack.""  This clearly indicates the tower's purpose was defensive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ovetã tuicháva** (It is very big): While the text mentions it's high, the primary function discussed isn't its size.
* **C: Sa'ive jeñangareko ambue castillo-gui** (It is like another castle): The text explicitly states it's a castle *with* a tower, not a copy of another.
* **D: Agyke pererĩ** (It has a tower): While true, this doesn't explain the *purpose* of the tower.  It's the defensive purpose that's highlighted.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko apytegui oiko porãvéta peteĩ oñanítavape oñembosako’íva peteĩ ñeñani temporada-pe g̃uarã?","The correct answer is **D: Eiporu gimnasio tete yvate gotyogua emomba'apo hag̃ua**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Peteĩ ñeñani campo traviesa rehe, oñembojoapývo tembiapo gimnacio-pe tete yvate gotyoguápe, upéva oiko porãvéva hína ñeñani temporada-pe guarã."" This translates to: ""On a difficult field day, doing gym work above the waist is what's best for the season.""

Therefore, option D directly reflects the information given in the text.  Let's look at why the others are incorrect:

*   **A: Ñeñani campo traviesa rehe arahaku jave** (Avoid field days): The text suggests doing gym work *instead* of struggling on the field day.
*   **B: Jeheka pya’eve hag̃ua práctica-jave** (Practice more frequently): While practice is important, the text doesn't specify *how* to improve for the season, only *what* activity is beneficial.
*   **C: Pya'eve mbohapy aravo'ígui** (In the third week): The text doesn't mention anything about a specific week of training.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ãva apytegui imba'eguasuvéva peteĩ oñanítavape primera clase medio kilómetro-gua?","The correct answer is **B: Resistencia oñemomba'eguasuvéramo pya'ekuaágui** (Resistence is depleted quickly).

Here's why:

The question asks what is the main reason the person in the scenario experienced a decrease in performance after the first half-mile (medio kilómetro) of the race. The text explicitly states: ""Peteĩ ñeñani campo traviesa rehe, oñembojoapývo tembiapo gimnacio-pe tete yvate gotyoguápe, upéva oiko porãvéva hína ñeñani temporada-pe guarã."" (On a difficult field day, doing gym exercises above the usual intensity, that was better for the season.) This implies that the intense gym work *depleted* their stamina, leading to a decrease in performance during the race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñeñani campo traviesa rehe araro'y jave** (Less running on the difficult field day) - The text doesn't mention less running on the field day, only that the gym work was more intense.
* **C: Omarkávi mbykyve mokõi aravo'igui** (Marked a significant decrease after two days) - The text focuses on the performance decrease *during* the first half-mile, not over two days.
* **D: Pya'ekuaa oñemomba'eguasuvéramo resistencia-gui** (Quickly depleted stamina) - While stamina was depleted, option B is a more complete and accurate reflection of the cause as described in the text.  The text doesn't just say stamina was depleted, it links it to the intense gym work and its impact on performance.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**.
"
"Atléta-pe g̃uarã, mávapa ko apytégui ndaikatúi ojehupyty práctica nutricional rupivente?","The correct answer is **A: Rendimiento poravẽ (Lower Performance)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks why an athlete might not achieve optimal nutritional practice.** The initial statement says that even with good energy balance, sufficient food intake, and supplementation, athletes might *still* not achieve optimal performance.
* **Option A, ""Rendimiento poravẽ,"" directly reflects this lack of optimal performance.** It aligns with the idea that despite good nutritional support, something is still hindering peak performance.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Jevy'ave (Energy/Vitality):** While nutrition impacts energy, the core issue stated is not about a lack of energy, but a lack of *optimal* performance.
* **C: Rendimiento yvateve (Higher Performance):** This is the opposite of what the initial statement implies.
* **D: Jeiko porã (Good/Well-performing):** This is again the opposite; the question is about *not* performing optimally.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndoje'éi atleta imitãvape g̃uarã ovy'ave hag̃ua ojapo jave deporte?","The correct answer is **B: Katuete ojapova'erã rendimiento yvatéva** (However, they can't achieve top performance).

Here's why:

* The prompt states that while some athletes may have good physical attributes (like being tall and strong), they *cannot* achieve top performance. The question asks *why* they can't.
* Option B directly addresses this by saying they ""can't achieve top performance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jekaru porã** (They are well-built): This is a characteristic mentioned as a potential attribute, not the reason for limited performance.
* **C: Jey'u heta** (They eat a lot): While nutrition is important, the passage implies it's not *sufficient* to overcome the limitations.
* **D: Eguerekóramo equilibrio energético** (They have energy balance):  Energy balance is good, but the passage suggests it's not enough for top performance.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the passage's message."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'ére oñaníva media distancia ikatu ojogua mba'erepykue hepyvéva?","The correct answer is **A: Oñandu mba'érepa oipotave**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* medium-distance running is considered beneficial.** The passage states that athletes are trying to understand *why* they achieve benefits from it. Option A directly addresses this.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **B: Oreko rupi beneficio:** While the passage mentions benefits, it's not the *reason* it's considered beneficial. It's the *result* being investigated.
* **C: Oreko rupi impacto irendimientope:** The passage mentions social impact, but it's not the core reason for the *physical* benefits.
* **D: Oĩ heta concepto ojavýva umi equipo ndahepýiva rehe:** This refers to the different concepts about training teams, which is a separate point from *why* medium-distance running is beneficial for individuals.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oikotevẽ ñeñani hag̃ua media distancia?","The correct answer is **A: Heta equipo (Many teams)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the text says about the *number of teams* participating in middle-distance running. The first paragraph states: ""Ñeñani orekóva media distancia hína peteĩ deporte ndahepýiva; katu oĩ heta concepto ojavýva umi equipo ojeiporu va'erãva ojejapo haguã."" This translates to: ""Middle-distance running is a very popular sport; however, there are many concepts to learn about how the participating teams are formed.""

Therefore, the text explicitly mentions that there are *many teams* involved. The other options don't align with what the text says.
"
Mávatepa oikuaapyva'ekue Resonancia magnética? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch ha Purcell**.

The text states: ""Resonancia magnética ha’e peteĩ física-pegua fenómeno (RMN), ojekuaa’ypyva’ekue 1930-pe Felix Block ( omba’apóva Stanford Mbo’ehaovusúpe) ha Edward Purcell ( Harvard Mbo’ehaovusúpe)...""

This clearly indicates that both Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell are credited with discovering or developing the principle of Magnetic Resonance. Raymond Damadian is mentioned later for his pioneering work in *diagnostic* Magnetic Resonance and building the first MRI scanner, but not for the initial discovery. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Bloch and Purcell are the ones who discovered/developed Magnetic Resonance.
"
Mba'e arýpe oñeme'ẽ patente ñepyrũ yvy'ape'ári? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Irundy ary uperire oñeme’ẽ peteĩ patente, ha’éva patente ñepyrũ yvy’ape’ári, oñeme’ẽva ko resonancia magnética campo-pe."" which translates to ""The following year, he was granted a patent, which was the first patent in the world, granting this magnetic resonance in the field.""  The year following Damadian's patent in 1970 is 1974.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oikuaava'erã avakuéra ikatu hag̃ua oikuaa ambue tapicha remimo'ã?","The correct answer is **A: Oipotáva (They are capable)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Avakuéra ha’e, hetavérõ, especie ikatupyryvéva omoñe’ẽkuaáva hapicha remimo’ã.""  This translates to: ""They are, above all, species capable of communicating with each other in a sophisticated way.""  The key word here is ""ikatupyryvéva,"" which means ""capable."" The passage then goes on to describe their ability to build, create, and understand complex things.  All of these are related to being *capable* of sophisticated communication and understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **B: Ojaposéva (They create)** - While they do create, it's not the core point being asked about in the question.
* **C: Oimo’ãva (They are comfortable/agreeable)** - This doesn't align with the passage's focus on sophisticated communication abilities.
* **D: Oñandúva (They are different)** - While they are different, that's not what the passage emphasizes as the key characteristic enabling complex communication.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oipytyvõ yvypórape oikuaávõ ambue tapicha ojaposéva?","The correct answer is **A: Jeipe'a jeikuaa'ỹ ambue ojapóvare** (Learning from others' experiences).

Here's why:

The text describes how Kóva's simulations and materials help people understand processes better by seeing how others have done things.  It emphasizes the ability to learn from and understand what others have created and accomplished. This directly relates to option A, which is learning from others' experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eikuaa ojeipotáva** (Knowing how to create) - While the simulations might lead to understanding how to create, the core point is about learning *from* existing creations, not just the ability to create.
* **C: Emaña ambue tapichare ehusga'ỹme** (Being skilled at helping others) - The text focuses on understanding *others'* work, not on helping *others*.
* **D: Emoñe'ẽ ambue temimo'ã** (Communicating in different ways) - While Kóva uses different materials, the central idea isn't about communication methods, but about gaining knowledge from others' actions.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ã mombyky apytégui añete IA rembipota guasuvéva?","The correct answer is **C: Programación**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Techapyrã ryepýpe oĩ control rape’apo ha **programación**, ñembohovaikuaa umi diagnóstico ha hasýva ñeporandu, upéicha avei pópe jehai jeikuaa, ñe’ẽ ha tova.""

This translates to: ""In practice, there is control of the **program** and programming, combining diagnoses and useful information, as well as the ability to see, speak, and respond.""

Therefore, programming is a fundamental aspect of how IA works and enables its functionalities. The other options are related but not as central as programming itself.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytégui IA-pe ko'ãga oñemoirũve?","The correct answer is **B: Rape'apo ha programación** (Programming and programming).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Techapyrã ryepýpe oĩ control rape’apo ha programación..."" which translates to ""In the initial stage, there is control of programming and programming..."".  This directly indicates that programming is fundamental to the development of AI.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ñembohovái hasývape (In innovation):** While innovation is a result of AI, it's not the *initial* stage of its development.
*   **C: Ciencia ficción (Science Fiction):** Science fiction often *imagines* AI, but the actual development starts with practical methods.
*   **D: Pópe jehai jeikuaa (Ability to recognize):** While recognition is an aspect of AI, it's a *capability* that arises *from* programming, not the initial stage itself.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytégui ha'e mba'e tuichavéva pe ñepensa patrón orekóva?","The correct answer is **D: Omoinge iñakape patrón-kuéra (They identify patterns)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that ""patron kuéra ojehuntava oñemoi porã haguã oĩ vaiva ombojojapava umi idea"" - that patterns help effectively organize ideas to find a solution.  It then states that ""ikatu omoinge iñakape patrón-kuéra"" - that they identify patterns.  This is a key aspect of how pattern thinking works, as it allows for better organization and problem-solving.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Heta ñembohovái oĩ porã (Many options are good):** This is too general and doesn't specifically address what makes pattern thinking *unique*.
* **B: Jeipuru mba'e kuaa pyahu (Quickly understand things):** While pattern thinking *can* lead to quicker understanding, it's not the defining characteristic. It's about the *how* of understanding, not just the speed.
* **C: Ñepensa mbegue oñemoĩ porã hag̃ua oĩ vaiva (Thinking is correctly organized):**  Organization is a *result* of identifying patterns, not the fundamental aspect of pattern thinking itself.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytégui ndaha'éi ohekáva ko ñepensa patrón?","The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ ñembohovái añoite oĩ porã (A well-defined problem)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that a good problem-solving mindset involves:

* **Clear thinking:**  ""ñepensa pua'e"" (clear thought)
* **Logic:** ""logica jeipuru"" (logical reasoning)
* **Structure:** ""jeipuru hesakuaitepe"" (structured thinking)
* **Information Gathering:** ""marandu jetopa"" (information is gathered)
* **Identifying knowns and unknowns:** ""jeipuru mba'e kuaa oĩva ha marandu jeporeka"" (identifying what is known and what is unknown)
* **A goal:** ""peteĩ solucion"" (a solution)
* **Iteration and Improvement:** ""Repensa hina mokõi ñembohováinte, oĩ porãva ha oĩ vaiva"" (Repress twice, there is one that is good and one that will be)

Option A, ""Peteĩ ñembohovái añoite oĩ porã,"" is a fundamental element of this mindset. You can't solve a problem effectively if the problem itself isn't clearly and precisely defined. The other options, while potentially helpful, are not as central to the core concept of the problem-solving approach outlined in the passage.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytégui ndojeikuaaichéne microexpresión-kuéra ramo?","The correct answer is **A: Ñemaña ambuegotyo eñe'ẽaja (They don't understand other language)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that people with brain damage can't recognize microexpressions, even though they can understand spoken language. The passage specifically mentions Oliver Sacks' observation in ""The President's Speech,"" where individuals with brain damage couldn't recognize emotions conveyed through microexpressions, despite understanding the words being spoken.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Odeforma pe hova (They distort the face):** While brain damage *can* sometimes cause facial distortions, the core issue related to microexpression recognition is the inability to interpret the subtle emotional cues.
* **C: Pya'e esapymi (They are just lying):**  This is an incorrect assumption.  The passage states that the brain damage doesn't prevent understanding *language*, it affects the ability to interpret *emotional expressions*.
* **D: Poguasu yvate gotyo (They look upwards):** This is irrelevant to the issue of microexpression recognition.



"
Mávapa ko'ã techaukaha apytépe microexpresión-kuéra rehegua ndaha'éiva añetegua?,"The correct answer is **B: Jajesareko porãramo ikatu ojeikuaa peteĩ tapichápa ijapu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Upáva rehe, oñemboaje ikatuha ojeikuaa peteĩ tapichápa ijapu jajesareko porãramo microexpresión-kuéra rehe.""  This translates to: ""Therefore, it is possible to understand a person's actions by accurately recognizing microexpressions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Grabación jeiporu omohenda kuri heta mba'e ojejuhúva:** (Recording captures many things that are done) - This is too general. While recording can capture actions, the passage focuses specifically on *understanding* actions through microexpressions.
* **C: Ñe'ẽ ha tova ku'e ikatu ojeikumby:** (Speech and tone of voice are what are recognized) - The passage mentions speech and tone, but it highlights microexpressions as a more accurate method of understanding.
* **D: Ikatu ohechakuaa he'i añetéva:** (It is possible to say that it is learned) - The passage talks about understanding actions, not necessarily about learning a specific thing.



Therefore, option B directly reflects the passage's core point about accurately understanding someone's actions through the recognition of microexpressions.



"
Mávapa ko'ã apytépe mba'e guasuve Renacimiento rupive? ,"The correct answer is **B: Mba'ekuaa ñemosarambi (Artistic Creativity)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Upe ojopýva ndaha'evéima tapicha imanu'áva rehe, katu upe jehaipy jegueromandu'a iñambue peteĩ enfoque ojeguerekóvape. **Upéicha, Renacimiento omoamue kuri mba'ejekuaa enfoque ha mba'ekuaa ñemoasarambi.**""

This translates to: ""That which is simple doesn't explain the person who is born, but the explanation I give is born from the emergence of a certain approach. **Thus, the Renaissance gave rise to artistic creativity and a new way of thinking.**""

Therefore, artistic creativity is directly mentioned as something the Renaissance brought about. The other options are either things the text *doesn't* attribute to the Renaissance or a consequence *of* the Renaissance, not a thing *brought about* by it.
"
"Renacimiento rupive, mba'épe oĩ sa'ive enfoque ko'ã apytégui?","The correct answer is **A: Tapicha imanu'áva**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Upe ojopýva ndaha'evéima tapicha imanu'áva rehe..."" which translates to ""The one who is ignorant does not know about the person who is born..."" This indicates that the focus (enfoque) is on the individual (tapicha) who is born or comes into being.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mba'ejekuaa jeguereko (What knowledge we create):** While related to the Renaissance, it's not the central focus of the paragraph's description of the *enfoque*.
*   **C: Jehaipy jegueromandu'a (The information I am telling you):** This refers to the speaker's narration, not the focus of the Renaissance.
*   **D: Mba'ekuaa ñemosarambi (Artistic creativity):** This is a result or consequence of the Renaissance's focus, but not the focus itself.

"Ko'ã apytégui, máva ndojehechaukái motivación oipuru hag̃ua internet umi relacion ipukúva?","The correct answer is **B: Nde rogayguandi reĩ hag̃ua en contacto (to stay in contact with loved ones)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pe jepytaso ndete ejapova"" (the ability to communicate) and ""umi relacion ipukuva"" (close relationships) also represent a motivational aspect (Eighmey and McCord, 1998). The text implies that staying in contact with loved ones is a key driver for internet use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Red de negocio-kuéra (Business networks):** While internet *can* be used for business, the text focuses on personal motivation.
* **C: Viaje jeheka (Travel):**  Travel is not mentioned in the context of internet motivation in the provided text.
* **D: Yvypóra pyahu jeikuaa (Seeing celebrities):**  Seeing celebrities is not a factor highlighted as a motivator in the passage.



"
"Ko'ã apytégui, máva ndojehechaukái motivación pe jepytaso ndete ejapova eipuru hag̃ua internet?","The answer is **C: Pohã jeheka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pe jepytaso ndete ejapova ojetopa avei aspecto de motivacion puahuicha..."" This translates to: ""The **amount of time spent** on the internet also affects the motivational aspect...""  ""Pohã jeheka"" means ""a lot"" or ""significant amount,"" which aligns with the idea that spending time on the internet contributes to motivation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Receta jeheka (Recipe for success):** This is not directly related to the text's focus on internet motivation.
*   **B: Panel de discusión jehecahuka (Unfiltered discussion panel):** This is also unrelated to the topic of motivation related to internet usage.
*   **D: Viropukuaa jemaneha (Unstable network):** While internet stability can impact the user experience, the text focuses specifically on *motivation*, and doesn't link internet stability to motivation.

Therefore, **C: Pohã jeheka** is the most appropriate answer.
"
Araka'e Europa occidente-gua oñypurũ oguerojera estilo imba'evoi?,"The correct answer is **A: Edad media paha rupi (During the Middle Ages)**.

The text states: ""Edad media ipaha gotyo Europa occidente-gua oguerojera ñepyrũ kuri estilo imba'evavoi..."" which translates to ""During the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a new style...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Byzantine época rupi (During the Byzantine era):** While the Gothic style *originated* with Byzantine influences, the question asks when Western Europe *developed* a new style.
* **C: 25 ary rupi edad media rire (25 years during the Middle Ages):** The text mentions a timeframe of 25-30 years for styles to develop in the West, but it doesn't specify *when* during the Middle Ages this happened. The correct answer points to the broader period.
* **D: Siglo 11 jave (In the 11th century):**  While the 11th century is a relevant period, the text indicates the development of the new style occurred *during* the Middle Ages, not just in the 11th century.



"
Mba'éicha rupi tapichakuéra oiporu votö pya'eve oñembojokupyty hag̃ua ao? ,"The correct answer is **C: Cruzada-kuéra rupi**.

This translates to: ""In the late Middle Ages in Western Europe, a new style emerged, and this happened because the Crusaders sought a way to connect with God.""

Therefore, the Crusaders (Cruzada-kuéra) are directly linked to the emergence of a new artistic style as they sought to express their faith and connect with God.

"Ko maranduhai rupive, mávapa ko'ã apytégui ha'éne ipukúva rehegua myatyrõ tekohape ğuarã?","The correct answer is **A: Ñembyai yvypóra rekove asa extravagante-va (Population control)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the most important solution to a sustainable future.** The preceding text discusses the problems of overpopulation and the need for long-term solutions beyond just symptomatic treatments.
* **The text explicitly mentions ""apañuái okakuaa avei superpoblación rehe"" (the awareness of overpopulation).** This directly links the problem to the need for population control measures.
* **While the other options might contribute to a sustainable future, they are not presented as the *most important* or overarching solution.**
    * B: Activismo (Activism) is important, but it's a broad category.
    * C: Jajuhuva'erã apañuái rapo (Awareness of overpopulation) is a necessary step, but not a solution in itself.
    * D: Jajoajukuaa tekoha rehe oku'éva ndive (Understanding the implications of family size) is related to population, but population control encompasses a wider range of strategies.



Therefore, population control is the most directly and importantly linked solution presented in the text to ensure a sustainable future.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jajoaju oku'éva ndive** (We will consult with others): While consultation might happen, the main point is the *research* to find a cure.
* **C: Ñame'ẽ ñande remiandu yvypóra rekove asa extravagante-va rehe** (We will talk about our concern over human overpopulation):  Human overpopulation is mentioned as a factor influencing scientific and technological advancement, but it's not presented as a *treatment* or a *solution* to the symptom.
* **D: Jaiko porãkuaave ñande rekoha ndive** (We will improve the relationship with our body): This refers to symptomatic treatment and is directly contradicted by the text's focus on finding a cure.

Mba'e tetãme raka'e tendondetegua ñorairõ Europa-pe oje'e pokatu ñembojoja rupi jeroviapy rangue rehe?,"The correct answer is **D: España-pe (Spain)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""La Guerra de Sucesión española omoñepyrũ peteĩha ñorairõ ha upépe ojeheka va'ekue pe pokatu rekojoja.""  This translates to ""The Spanish War of Succession initiated the first major conflict and in it, the principle of hereditary succession was upheld.""

The question asks which country's civil war brought the principle of hereditary succession to the forefront. The text directly links the Spanish War of Succession to this principle.
"
"""Máva ñorairõpe ojeikuaa sapy'a avei """"ñorairõ jeroviapy rehe""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Guerra de los Treinta Años**.

The text states: ""pe Guerra de los Treinta Años ha’éta pe ipahapegua ojeherótava ñorãirõ jeroviapy rehe."" (The Thirty Years' War is the climax that demonstrates the outbreak of war.)

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Heta oĩma oma’ẽ saykéva he’ikuévo añetehápepa oñemboguata hína ko’ã principio he’íva"" (Many have questioned where these principles were interpreted). This directly links the questioning to the interpretation of the principles *by the Church*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pirapire tupão ryepýpepa oñemboja'o porã** (The clear explanation of the Church's priestly power): While the text mentions the Church's power, it doesn't say it's a clear explanation of priestly power being questioned.
* **B: Umi principio religión he'ívapa ojeguerovava'erã** (The way the religious principles are interpreted): The text focuses on *where* the principles are interpreted, not *how*.
* **C: Poder oñembyatýva tupãope** (Power concentrated in the Church): The text mentions power being concentrated in the Church, but the main question is *where* the principles are interpreted, stemming from the concentration of power.



Therefore, option D most accurately reflects the core of the question posed in the text."
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mávapa ojejuka Versalles-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ kuña ñemuhapegua (One day)**.

The passage states: ""6 japa 1789 ramo kuña ñemuhapegua aty pochy oñemyaña chupekuéra..."" which translates to ""On June 6, 1789, a mob stormed their palace...""  Therefore, the event happened on a specific day.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rey Louis XVI (King Louis XVI):** While the king was involved, the question asks what happened *at Versalles*.
* **C: Peteĩ mafia atygua (A mob):** The mob *caused* the event, but it's not the event itself.
* **D: Peteĩ guardia (A guard):** The guard's action was part of the event, but not the event itself.



"
Ko'ã apytéguipa mba'e ndojopýi hikuári Rey ha Reina-pe umi tapicha?,"The correct answer is **C: Guardia akãngue jehecha** (The royal guard saw them).

Here's why:

The text states that a ""mafia atygua"" (a mob) caused a royal guard to see the queen being threatened. Options A, B, and D all describe things that *did* happen in the text. Option C is the only one that describes something the mob *did* to the royal couple.
"
Mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndaha'éi Gran Bretaña convencional-ỹva rupi guerra naval?,"The correct answer is **A: Alemania ojapose rupi estrategia upéichagua** (Germany implemented such a strategy).

Here's why:

* The passage describes how Britain implemented a naval blockade.  The question asks what *isn't* a conventional naval war *by Britain*.
* The passage then states that as a result of the blockade, Germany *implemented a submarine war*. This is a direct consequence and a strategic response by Germany to Britain's naval blockade.  It's the key departure from traditional naval warfare.
* Options B, C, and D describe effects or consequences of the blockade, not a fundamentally different *strategy* employed by Britain.  The core point is that Germany responded to the blockade with a non-conventional tactic.



Therefore, the answer is A.
"
Mávapa ko'ã ñe’ẽ apytégui ndaha'éi añetete upe bloqueo naval Gran Bretaña ojapóva Alemania rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Opyrũ derecho internacional rehe (International law)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""jepéramo ko jehapeko opyrũ derecho internacional oñemoeĩva heta acuerdo internacional-pe ko’ã mokõi siglo ohasavápe ko’ã mokõi acuerdo internacional-pe oñemboaje va’ekue rehe.""  This translates to: ""Furthermore, this approach initiated international law, which has been incorporated into many international agreements over these two centuries, leading to the rejection of such agreements.""  The initial justification for the naval blockade was its basis in international law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Omyaña Alemania guerra submarina (Germany initiated submarine warfare):** While the blockade *led to* Germany initiating submarine warfare, it wasn't the reason for the blockade itself. It was a consequence.
* **C: Ojoko opaichagua suministro Alemania-gui (It cut off all supplies from Germany):** This is a *result* of the blockade, not the underlying reason for establishing it.
* **D: Umi barco neutral ndoñemoĩri peligro-pe (Neutral ships were not in danger):** The text states the opposite – that neutral ships were in danger, which is why the blockade was implemented.

Therefore, the international law aspect is the fundamental reason given in the text for the naval blockade.

"Ko maranduhai rupive, mávape ikatuve ojediagnostica esclerosis múltiple?","The text doesn't provide information about the age of the person in question. It only states that multiple sclerosis (EM) is a neurological disease affecting the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves, and it's more common in women than men.  Therefore, none of the provided options (A, B, C, D) can be definitively answered based *solely* on the text.

**However, the question is a bit misleading.** The question asks ""mávape ikatuve ojediagnostica esclerosis múltiple?"" which translates to ""At what age is multiple sclerosis diagnosed?"". The text doesn't say *when* someone is diagnosed, only that it's more common in women.

Without further information, I cannot definitively answer.  However, let's analyze the options and see if one is *more likely* based on general knowledge, even though the text doesn't state it. Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed between the ages of **20 and 40**.

Considering that, the closest option, even with no information from the provided text, is:

**C: Kuimba'e 43 ary orekóvape (Man aged 43)**.  While the text mentions it's more common in women, 43 is a plausible age for a diagnosis for either gender.

**Important Disclaimer:**  **This is an educated guess based on general knowledge, *not* on information provided in the text.** A medical diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional.

"Ko maranduhai rupive, ambue ojapóva teteku'e mba'e oikotevẽve?","The correct answer is **A: Ykeko tasy percepción negativa rehe** (Negative perception of pain).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ambue ojapóva teteku'e oikotevẽve kuri ykeko tasy percepción negativa rehe, oikumbývo mba'éichapa iñambue tasy crónico ha hasyvýva ojeheteku'e jave.""  This translates to: ""Other treatments, when performed, involve a negative perception of pain, making it clear how chronic and persistent pain can be.""

The passage directly links a negative perception of pain to the resulting chronic and persistent pain.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lumbar** - While the passage mentions lumbar issues as a cause of depression, it doesn't state that *other treatments* involve lumbar issues.
*   **C: Depresión** - The passage refutes the idea that the catastrophic effects are *caused* by depression.
*   **D: Kyhyje** (Anxiety) - While anxiety is mentioned, the passage specifically points to the *perception* of pain as the key element involving other treatments.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba'éicha oñeha'ã esgrima?","The correct answer is **D: Duelo formato-pe**.

The passage states: ""Ko ñoa'ãngatu oiko duelo formato-ramo, peteĩ escrima ra'ãha ambuéva rovake."" which translates to ""This competition is in a duel format, one fencer against another.""

Therefore, the answer is D.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ikatu ha'e síntoma envenenamiento hyepýpe rehegua?","The correct answer is **B: Gue'ẽ ha ty'ái (Dizziness and vomiting)**.

The text states that symptoms of poisoning are not easily recognized, and this makes early diagnosis difficult. It also mentions that a good indication of poisoning is the appearance of a swallowed or toxic chemical substance. While the text doesn't list specific symptoms, **dizziness and vomiting** are common and frequently mentioned symptoms of poisoning.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Py'ajere ha akanundu (Convulsions and tremors):** While possible in severe cases, these are not typical first-line symptoms.
*   **C: Calambre ha tye rasy (Spasms and muscle cramps):** These can be symptoms of various conditions, not necessarily poisoning.
*   **D: Pohã recetada ryru (Prescribed medicine):** This option is irrelevant to the question about poisoning symptoms.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ejapova'erã tenondete ejesareko hag̃ua víctima rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Ejesareko mba'écihapa opyta ra'e**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the text says someone should do when they encounter a victim of a crime. The text states: ""Ojesareko va'erã escena rehe oñangareko hagua ijehe. Ojesareko va'erã mba'écihapa opyta ra'e víctimia oñembojávo hese ha oĩmeraẽ alerta ijehegui reheguáva...""

This translates to: ""If you encounter a crime scene, you should check the surroundings, check what happened to the victim when they were injured, and be aware of a possible alert from a witness.""

Option C, ""Ejesareko mba'écihapa opyta ra'e"" (Check what happened to the victim when they were injured), directly reflects this instruction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ejesareko escena rehe (Check the scene):**  While mentioned, it's not the *primary* action the text highlights.  Checking what happened to the victim is the more important part of the instruction.
* **B: Eñemoaguĩ ehóvo víctima rehe (Approach the victim):** The text implies caution and being aware of potential danger (""oĩmeraẽ alerta ijehegui reheguáva"" - a possible alert from a witness), so approaching the victim directly isn't recommended in the context of the text.
* **D: Eha'arõ pytyvõ (How to help):** While helping is the ultimate goal, the text specifically tells you *what to do initially* when encountering the victim - check what happened to them.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e nderejapóiva'era ejesareko hag̃ua víctima rehe?","The correct answer is **B: Ejesareko escena rehe tenonde víctima mboyve (You assess the scene, prioritizing the victim)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what you *don't* do when assessing a victim. The initial statement describes the correct procedure: prioritize the victim's safety and well-being. Options A, C, and D all describe actions *you would* take. Option B describes an action that would be incorrect, because the priority is always the victim, not the surrounding scene. You assess the scene *around* the victim, but your primary focus is on them.



"
Mba'e ñemoambue ojapóva Revolución Francesa ojapo efecto clase trabajadora ári?,"The correct answer is **A: Hetave pytyvõ tetãme (It helped the nation)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the French Revolution led to the emergence of candidates from the people (the populace) and the creation of a system where people could be elected to hold office. It also mentions the rise of the working class and their participation in the revolution.  This ultimately empowered the nation by bringing the people into the political process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Clase-gui jeva competencia-pe (Competition between classes):** While class tensions were present, the revolution's impact on the working class was more about empowering them than just intensifying competition.
*   **C: Temimo'ã republicano ojejagarra (The republican ideal was seized):** While a republican government *was* established, the question asks about the effect on the working class, not the seizure of an ideal.
*   **D: Sistema métrico pyahu (Improved metric system):**  The text mentions the improved metric system as a result of the revolution, but this doesn't directly address the effect on the working class.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the revolution's impact on the working class and the nation as a whole based on the provided text."
"Revolución Francesa rire, militar ha ambuepe ohupyty hag̃ua ohekáva, mba'épe sa'ive ojejesareko?","The correct answer is **B: Clase rehe (By Class)**.

The text states: ""Revolución rire, tetã rekuáipe jeikerã oñehokẽpe’a opavave candidato kuimba’épe g̃uarã, upéva ombohape umi ivare’arekove ha iñapysẽvéva ohupyty hag̃ua ohekáva. **Upéva oiko avei militar-kuéra apytépe ojejesareko rãngue rupi clase rehe oñeñemohenda hag̃ua ejercito-pe, ojejesareko cailaber rehe.**""

This translates to: ""During the Revolution, it became possible to elect a candidate based on their gender, which allowed the ambitious and those who had risen in status to attain power. **This also involved the military uniting by class to be organized in the army, and to be organized by rank.**""

Therefore, the military was reorganized **by class**. While ""cailaber"" refers to rank, the broader point is the organization *by class*.
"
Mba'e servicio público oje'e ndogustáiva umi tetãnguéra iñakarapu’ãvéva ryepýpe ?,"The correct answer is **C: Mba’yrumỹi público (Public infrastructure)**.

Here's why:

* **The question describes a situation where public infrastructure (bridges) is failing.** The text mentions bridges being unable to handle heavy traffic and the need for repair.
* **The question asks what public service is disliked by the cities due to the traffic congestion.**  The context implies that the failing infrastructure is the reason for the dislike and congestion.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Y vai (Yes)** - This is a response to a general question and doesn't specify the *type* of public service.
* **B: Puente mopu'ã (Good bridge)** - This is the *opposite* of what's happening. The bridges are *not* good.
* **D: Tekombo'e (Roads)** - While roads are part of infrastructure, the question specifically mentions *bridges*. ""Mba'yrumỹi público"" is a more encompassing term for the infrastructure being discussed.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa ikatu oje'e umi mba'yrumỹi ñemohenda rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Aimete opavave tapichakuéra oiporuva ipochyjoa**.

Here's why:

* **The question describes a situation where people are concerned about the safety of bridges and other structures being weakened by corrosion.** This concern is expressed by the people themselves.
* **Option C directly reflects this concern.** The question asks why people are worried about the weakening of structures and mentions their concerns being voiced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mayma oporúva ohayhu (It's not the result of a storm):** The question doesn't mention a storm as the cause of the corrosion.
* **B: Ndaha'éi ivaíva y-guaicha (It's not like a human):** This doesn't address the concern about corrosion.
* **D: Ha'e grati aimete opavave tetãnguéra iñakarapu’ãvéva ryepýpe (It's a free concern voiced in the context of the safety of the city's infrastructure):** While the concern is related to infrastructure, it's the *people* voicing the concern, not a general, free concern.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ko'ã apytépe hasyeterei ojejesareko porã hag̃ua mba'yrumỹi mboguatakuéra rupi?","The correct answer is **D: Tráfico ñemongu’e (Traffic flow)**.

The passage explicitly states that Traffic Flow is hindered by the inability to perfectly understand the movement of vehicles and the fact that vehicles are only observed in a limited range. It then says that Traffic Flow is improved by three characteristics: flow, speed, and safety.  The whole passage revolves around improving traffic flow.
"
Máva ko'ã apytégui ojeiporu ojehechauka ha oñembopapapy hag̃ua trafico ñemongu'e?,"The correct answer is **C: Tapekuéra jehai**.

Here's why:

The text states that Traffic Flow improves traffic management by combining three characteristics: **(1) ñemongu'e (efficiency), (2) hetakue (safety), and (3) ipya'ekue (smoothness)**. These characteristics help to reduce traffic jams and improve the efficiency of road networks. The text also mentions that roads are ""jehai"" (managed/controlled).

Therefore, the option ""Tapekuéra jehai"" (Road management) best represents how traffic flow is monitored and improved.
"
Mba'e oiporu Hershey ha Chase omoĩ hag̃ua ADN? ,"The correct answer is **B: Material genético**.

Here's why:

* **The Hershey-Chase experiment was designed to prove that DNA, not protein, is the genetic material.** They used radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA and radioactive sulfur to label the protein of the bacteriophage (the virus that infects bacteria).  By observing which component entered the bacterial cell, they determined that DNA was the substance responsible for carrying genetic information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fósforo radiactivo (Radioactive phosphorus):**  While they *used* radioactive phosphorus, it was a *tool* to identify the DNA, not the *purpose* of the experiment.
* **C: Azufre radiactivo (Radioactive sulfur):** Similarly, radioactive sulfur was used to label the protein, but it wasn't the main aim of the experiment.
* **D: Virus:**  Viruses (specifically bacteriophages in this case) were the *vehicle* used to deliver the genetic material, but the experiment was about *what* that material was.



"
Mutación ohasa hag̃ua ñemoñare mba'e oikotevẽ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ojehechakuaava'erã material genético** (It checks the genetic material).

Here's why:

The question ""Mutación ohasa hag̃ua ñemoñare mba'e oikotevẽ?"" translates to ""What happens when a mutation occurs?"" The provided text states that mutations can affect the genetic material, the cells, and the germ cells.  Option B directly addresses what the text says happens *when* a mutation occurs – it checks the genetic material.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Umi célula ha'éramo linea germinal rehegua** (The cells are of the germ line): While mutations *can* occur in germ line cells, this describes a type of cell, not what *happens* during the process of a mutation.
* **C: Mba'eichagua mutación-pa** (Various mutations): This simply states that there are different kinds of mutations. It doesn't describe the process itself.
* **D: Mutación-pa ikatu ojuka célula-pe** (The mutation can enter a cell):  While mutations *can* enter cells, this describes a possible outcome, but not the fundamental process that occurs during a mutation.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is B because the text explicitly mentions that mutations involve checking/affecting the genetic material."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e efecto-pa ndojapói mba'eve mutación rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Mboýpa ha'e material genético ivaíva (The genetic material is altered)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks about the *effect* of mutations. The passage states that mutations involve changes in the genetic material.
* Options B, C, and D describe aspects of mutations *themselves* or related processes (like germline mutations potentially causing cancer) but don't directly address the *effect* of the mutation.  Option A is the most direct and accurate description of what a mutation *does* to the genetic material.



"
"Ko'ã apytépe, máva ndaha'éi mba'érepa Cultura ha tribu-kuéra oreko raka'e kavara?","The correct answer is **C: Ome'ẽ hikuái compañía (Provides company)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the reasons for domesticating sheep:

* **""Kavara domesticado ojeguerekómi va'ekue rebaño oĩva yvatehápe térã ambue tenda pastoreo oĩhápe, kavarakuéra ñangarekoha va'ekue mitã terã mitãrusukuéra, ojoguáva pator-kuéra jaikuaáva ko'ágã.""** (Domesticated sheep were kept in herds in higher areas or other grazing areas, and the sheep's movement led the people to discover this land.) This highlights the benefit of finding new grazing lands.
* **""Ko'ã pastoreo método ojeiporu gueri ko'ágã.""** (This grazing method became common in this area.) This indicates the practical use of the sheep for pastoralism.

The text mentions sheep provided food (meat, milk, wool, and hair) and helped with grazing.  It *doesn't* mention they were kept for company. Therefore, option C is the incorrect answer."
Mba'e oñeha'ã golf-pe sa'ive?,"The correct answer is **A: Pelota (Ball)**.

The passage clearly states that the game involves hitting a ball into a hole. Therefore, the ball is the fundamental object used in golf.
"
Golf ñembosarái kapi'ipépe mba'éicha héra?,"The correct answer is **B: Green-pe**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks where the golf game is played in the final stage.** The text states: ""Ñembosarái oiko kapi'ipépe upe yvykua jerére ha héra green."" which translates to ""The game is played in the area around the hole and is called the green.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Papoapy yvykua (Approach shot):** This refers to a shot *towards* the green, not the final playing area.
* **C: Pe yvykua peteĩha (The first tee):** This is where the game *begins*, not where it's played in the final stage.
* **D: Ñembosarái mbytéramõ (Beyond the fairway):** While the game might happen beyond the fairway, the final playing area is the green.



"
Mba'e ohupytyse jehesa'ỹijo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojeipe'a hag̃ua peteĩ térã hetave hipótesis**.

Here's why:

The question asks what a scientist *does* (ohupytyse jehesa'ỹijo - what does a scientist achieve?).  The passage states: ""ndaha'éi jehesa'ỹijónte, peteĩ jehesa'ỹijo ojeiporu ojeipe'a hag̃ua peteĩ térã hetave hipótesis..."" which translates to ""not just to write, a scientist proposes one or more hypotheses...""

The other options are related to the scientific method but aren't what a scientist *achieves* specifically in terms of the research itself.

* **B: Ojeiikuaa hag̃ua mba'échapa oiko arapy** (To understand how the process works): This describes the *understanding* of the scientific method, not what a scientist *does*.
* **C: Jeporandu hag̃ua** (To gather information): While scientists gather information, this is a component of the process, not the main achievement of a scientific investigation.
* **D: Ombohapéva científico rapereka** (To demonstrate to other scientists):  This is a result of the process, specifically *sharing* findings, not the core activity of the research itself.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ndopytyvõi cientifico-kuéra rapereka?","The correct answer is **C: Jeipe'a hipótesis (Formulate hypotheses)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndaha'éi jehesa'ỹijónte, peteĩ jehesa'ỹijo ojeiporu ojeipe'a hag̃ua peteĩ térã hetave hipótesis..."" which translates to: ""Not simply by observing, a scientist formulates one or more hypotheses...""

This directly indicates that formulating hypotheses is a key characteristic of the scientific method and distinguishes it from simple observation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Método científiko año (Year of the scientific method):** The text doesn't discuss a specific year.
* **B: Jehecha apo (Observation):** The text explicitly says scientists do *more* than just observe.
* **D: Jehesa'ỹijo jejapo (Creating an experiment):** While experiments are part of the scientific method, the text focuses on the initial step of hypothesis formation.

"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba'e ndaha'éi añete tornado rehegua?","The correct answer is **D: Peteĩva tornado ikatu oguereko yvytu ohupytykuaáva 300 milla por hora (300mph)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that tornadoes can have winds up to **480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)**.
* Option D claims a single tornado can have winds *only* 300 mph. This contradicts the information provided in the text.
* Options A, B, and C are all directly supported by the information in the text.
"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, máva ko'ã techauka apytépe ha'e añete aimete opa tornado rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Hi'arekuaa hetave mbohapy aravógui**

The text states: ""Dos por ciento tornado hatãvéva hi'arekuaa hetave mbohapy aravógui."" which translates to ""Two percent of tornado outbreaks occur in three hours or less.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Oguereko yvytu ohypyty kuaáva 480 milla por hora (480 mph)** - While true, this describes the wind speed of a tornado, not a characteristic of *all* tornadoes.
*   **C: Tornado ho'akuaa peteĩ apu'a tuichavévape ambue tormenta-kuéra hatãva rovake** - This is a definition of a tornado, not a characteristic that all tornadoes share.
*   **D: Tornado-kuéra ohapo'o yvyramáta** - This describes what tornadoes *do* to the ground, not a defining characteristic of all tornadoes.



"
Mba'e oñepyrũ ojapo avakuéra siglo 16-pe?,"The correct answer is **D: Ojapo telescopio**.

The passage states: ""Telescopio tee jejapo ñepyrũmby ojejapo Europa-pe siglo 16 opapotávo."" (Telescopes were first made in Europe in the 16th century.) 

While the passage also mentions lenses (""lente jehecha""), it clarifies that the *telescope* was the key invention of that time.
"
Araka'e guive avakuéra ombotuichaverã oiporuhápe lente?,"The correct answer is **B: Siglo 16 opapotávo** (Invented in the 16th century).

The text states: ""Ko'ã telescopio ojejapo ñepyrũmby ojejapo Europa-pe siglo 16 opapotávo."" which translates to ""These telescopes were first made in Europe in the 16th century.""
"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba'e he'i pe itakua Muhammad ojapova ha ijerovia rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Ha'e oñemomombyry opavavégui (He escaped by fleeing)**.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the text clearly indicates *escape* and *fleeing*, not seeking help, being a prophet, or observing and understanding.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'erã ojeiporu ñepyrũva'ekue hierro?","The correct answer is **C: Rueda (Wheel)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbeguakatu, katu, ohechakuaa pista-kuéra oikokuavétaha oguerekóramo peteĩ hierro hu'ãme. Kóva ojejapo meme, katu pe hierro ombyai pya'eve vagón rueda madera-kuéragui ojejapóva. Upeicha umi rueda madera-guigua oñembohekovia rueda de hierro rehe.""

Translation: ""However, it was observed that the rails were being damaged when wood was placed between them. Thus, iron was made to replace the wooden wheels of the wagons. In this way, the wooden wheels were connected to iron wheels.""

This clearly indicates that iron was used to make the *wheels* of the wagons, replacing the wooden ones.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'ére rupi oñembohekovia rueda madera-gua rueda de hierro rehe?","The correct answer is **D: Hierro ombyai pya'eve umi vagón rueda madera-kuéragui ojejapóva** (Iron made the wagons with wooden wheels faster).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Mbeguakatu, katu, ohechakuaa pista-kuéra oikokuavétaha oguerekóramo peteĩ hierro hu'ãme. Kóva ojejapo meme, katu pe hierro ombyai pya'eve vagón rueda madera-kuéragui ojejapóva."" This translates to: ""However, it was observed that the tracks were strengthened by using an iron band. This made the wagons with wooden wheels faster.""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Heta kavaju ipya'eve** (Many horses were faster) - The text doesn't mention horses.
* **B: Hembiapo porãve rupi** (Because it was more efficient) - While efficiency might be a result, the text specifically highlights the speed improvement.
* **C: Hetave carga ogueropu'aka** (Because it could carry more cargo) - The text doesn't mention increased cargo capacity.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e omboheko tapichakuérape Romanticismo jave?","The correct answer is **B: Geografía (Geography)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Romanticismo ryepýpe, geografía omboheko tapichakuérape ha ára ohasávo iñapysẽ oapichagua teko ohóva pe geografía rehe."" This translates to: ""In the Romantic period, geography influences people and their aspirations become focused on things related to geography.""

Therefore, geography is the element that the text says influenced people during the Romantic period.
"
Máva ko'ãva apytépe ndohechaukái determinismo tecnológico idea? ,"The correct answer is **C: Tecnología oreko efecto inherente sociedad ári**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a core debate within technological determinism revolves around whether technology has an inherent effect on society *independent* of societal influences. Option C accurately reflects this central point. The text says: ""pe tecnologia oguereko efecto ambue avakuérare ouva inerente ha ndaha'éi pe socieda ocondicionava"" (technology has an effect on other things that is inherent and not conditioned by society).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tecnología efecto avakuérare ha'e sociedad ocondicionava** (Technology has an effect and society conditions it): This is the *opposite* of what technological determinism often argues.
*   **B: Tecnología desarrollo ndaha'éi cultura-gui influencia** (Technology development is not influenced by culture): The passage states that culture *does* influence technological development.
*   **D: Desarrollo tecnologico ndaha'éi política-gui influencia** (Technological development is not influenced by politics): The passage states that politics *does* influence technological development.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva ko'ã apytépe ndojojái ñambosyryry pe arco?","The correct answer is **A: Mbopu vevyive (When the bow is empty)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Arco yvate gotyo katuete ombopu vevuive, arco yvy gotyo ipu hatãve aja."" which translates to ""An arco yvate gotyo is completely empty, an arco yvy gotyo is empty when it reaches the frog.""

Therefore, the only time you wouldn't draw the bow is when it's empty (mbopu vevyive).
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva ko'ã apytépe ojoja ñembopu vevuive ndive?","The correct answer is **A: Arco yvy gotyo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Arco yvate gotyo katuete ombopu vevuive, arco yvy gotyo ipu hatãve aja.""  This translates to: ""Arco yvate gotyo is almost always (or very often) has a clear curve, arco yvy gotyo has a straight edge.""  

The question asks which of the options is NOT a characteristic of *your* (meaning, the one you are holding) bow.  The text explicitly says that the ""arco yvy gotyo"" has a straight edge (""ipu hatãve aja""), meaning it's not curved.
"
Kanguekue ohechauka po ojeadaptava'ekue ojeiporu hag̃ua mba'erã?,"The correct answer is **D: Jeguata nudillo ári**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka'i guasu po ha ipy ojoguáva tuichakue ha ipukuke, ohechaukáva po jeiporu oñemoĩ haguã pohyuikue jeguata haguã nudillo ári."" This translates to: ""When it grows large and its claws become numerous and its fingers, when it is able to grasp, it inserts a claw by grasping with its knuckles.""

Therefore, the fossil evidence shows that the creature adapted to grasping **by grasping with its knuckles (jeguata nudillo ári)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mba'ejokópe (In what way):** This is too general. The question asks *how* they adapted to grasping.
* **B: Oñemoĩ hagua pohyuikue (Inserting a claw):** This describes *what* they did, not *how* they adapted.
* **C: Jeguata (Grasping):**  While grasping is part of the adaptation, the text specifies *how* they grasped (with the knuckles).



"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytégui ohechauka porã ka'i po kangue? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ojeiporu oñemoĩ hag̃ua pohyuikue**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the formation of the first finger (ka'i) involved the placement of a ""pohyuikue"" (likely meaning a small bone or element). Option C directly reflects this process. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ikarẽ’ỹve peteĩ avagui (It's due to a single stage):** The passage indicates a gradual process over millions of years.
* **B: Ipo ha ipy ndojojoguái tuichakuépe (The tip and base don't grow much):** The passage describes the tip and base (ipy and ikarẽ'ỹve) as important in the process.
* **D: Ojeiporu mba'ejoko g̃uarã (It's due to a complex thing):** While the process is complex, the passage emphasizes the specific action of placing the ""pohyuikue.""



"
Jeiporavo ombogue ñemoambue mutación pyahu mba'e atýgui?,"The correct answer is **D: Ohechaukáva**

Here's why:

The question asks what mutation causes *to be transmitted* from one generation to the next.

* **Mutation:** A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence. It's the *initial* source of new genetic variation.
* **Segregation:**  This is the separation of allele pairs during gamete formation (sperm and egg).
* **Recombination:** This is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis.

While segregation and recombination *distribute* the mutated allele, the **mutation itself** is the event that *creates* the new allele in the first place. The mutated allele is then passed down.

Therefore, the mutation *causes* the new genetic variation to be passed on.  ""Ohechaukáva"" (that which is transmitted/passed on) is the most accurate way to describe the result of a mutation in terms of inheritance.



"
Mba'e proceso ha'e responsable omoĩ haguére ñemoambue mutación?,"The correct answer is **C: Mutación**.

The question asks what process is responsible for *creating* a mutation. The passage states: ""Mutación omoĩ peteĩ ñemoambue pyahu..."" which translates to ""Mutation creates a new allele...""

Therefore, the answer is mutation.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ho'uva'erã ka'i orekóramo problema proteína rehegua?","The correct answer is **C: Saltamonte**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Ka'avo oĩva ojehupyty pya'evéva ha'e va'erã kuri proteína oĩva togue ha legumbre-pe..."" which translates to ""The protein found in grasshoppers and legumes is easily digested..."" and later ""...umi tembi'u oúva mymbakuéragui (tahýi, kupi'i, tupi'águi) ndaha'éi ojesigeri pya'évante, avei ome'ẽ heta proteína orekóva opaite aminoácido oñeikotevẽva."" which translates to ""...insects (grasshoppers, crickets, etc.) are not easily digested, but they also provide a lot of protein containing all the essential amino acids.""  Finally, the text concludes ""...ko'ã árape chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme ko'ágã chipmance-kuéra oĩva ñúme"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva ko'ã apytépe ndaha'éi aminoácido ñeikotevẽ rupi?","The correct answer is **B: Desnutrición (Malnutrition)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ndojapóramo oguereko consecuencia ivaíva; jekakuaa depresión, **desnutrición** ha amo hapópe, ñemano."" (we can suffer adverse consequences; psychological depression, **malnutrition** and weakening, illness).

The passage explains that certain plant proteins are not easily digested by primates, leading to potential nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, malnutrition is a consequence mentioned in the text.
"
Mba'éicha atyguakuéra peteĩ subcultura-pegua ohechauka upepeguaha hikuái?,"The correct answer is **D: Oiporu estilo isimbólico-va** (They present a symbolic style).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** How do people within a subculture present their style?
* **The provided text states:** ""Peteĩ subcultura atyguakuéra jepivéramo ohechauka upepeguaha peteĩ mba'e jeiporu iñambue ha simbólico-va estilo-gui..."" which translates to ""When a group of people within a subculture are identified, they present something through a distinctive and symbolic style...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñeha'ã ojehe'a** (They try to be heard): While expressing themselves is part of it, it doesn't directly address *how* they present their style.
* **B: Ojagarra jerovia ijererehegua** (They grab their own language): Language is *part* of the style, but the option isn't comprehensive. The style includes more than just language (fashion, mannerisms, etc.).
* **C: Omoñei estándar social-kuéra** (They reject social standards):  Rejecting social standards is a *characteristic* of many subcultures, but it doesn't describe *how* they present themselves.  The text explains how they present themselves *despite* or *in contrast to* those standards.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided text.

"Ko mba’ekuaarã he’iháicha oñeme’ẽva ko maranduhaipe, mba'e ikatu oiko peteĩ mitã oikuaáva peteĩ raza sa'ivevaguaha ha orekóva estereotipo comportamiento rehegua?","The correct answer is **A: Pe mitã oñeha'ãta ojecomporta hag̃ua** (The person is inclined to behave).

Here's why:

The initial statement says that people are prone to acting in ways that reinforce stereotypes, even if they consciously reject those stereotypes. The question asks what happens when a person consciously rejects a stereotype but still holds it.  The answer ""Pe mitã oñeha'ãta ojecomporta hag̃ua"" best captures the idea that despite conscious rejection, the ingrained stereotype still influences behavior, making the person *inclined* to behave in accordance with it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe mitã ndojecomportamo'ãi** (The person does not behave): This is contradicted by the initial statement, which indicates that stereotypes *do* influence behavior, even subconsciously.
* **C: Pe mitã ojehekýita situación social-gui** (The person is influenced by the social situation): While social situations *do* influence behavior, the question specifically focuses on the influence of *holding a stereotype*.  The answer isn't just about social influence in general.
* **D: Pe mitã ndojehe'asemõái umi raza sa'ivévandi** (The person doesn't acknowledge the stereotypes): The initial statement implies that people *do* acknowledge stereotypes, even if they try to reject them.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate response to the question based on the provided text."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, peteĩ mitã oikuaaramo estereotipo raza rehegua, mba'épe ikatu oreko impacto?","The correct answer is **A: Ha'e oporavo mba'e raza sa'ivevaguahapa ha'e**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the impact of a person holding racial stereotypes. The passage states that when someone *perceives* (oikuaa) a racial stereotype, it influences (oporavo) their behavior towards people of that race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Heko:**  This is incomplete and doesn't make sense in the context.
* **C: Heko ambue mitãndive:**  ""Heko ambue mitãndive"" means ""it affects others."" While the stereotype *does* affect others, the immediate impact is on the person holding the stereotype.
* **D: Mba'épa he'ise chupe raza:** This translates to ""What their own race says.""  This is irrelevant to the passage's focus on the impact of *racial stereotypes*.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva ndaha'eichéne ojoajúva omongakuaávo peteĩ mitã salvaje-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Oiko ijeheguíntema (They become feral)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...mitã salvaje-va ikatu ohasa kuri abuso térã mitã trauma rehe ojehejarei térã okañy mboyve. Ambuéva rehe katu oje'e mymbakuéra omongakuaaha chupekuéra; oje'e ambue oikohague ka'aguýre ojeheguíntema.""

This translates to: ""...feral children can survive abuse or severe trauma, or extreme neglect. Others are said to become feral; others, when seen in the jungle, are said to wander around.""

Therefore, the text directly links ""mitã salvaje-va"" (feral children) to the behavior of ""ojeheguíntema"" (wandering around/becoming feral). The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e añete mitã salvaje comportamiento rehe?","The best answer is **A: Aimete opavave comportamiento oiko deterioro hetépe rupi (Comportamiento salvaje es un comportamiento que causa deterioro)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes that ""salvaje"" behavior is linked to a lack of socialization.**  It describes children who, due to neglect, abuse, or intentional harm, haven't developed proper socialization skills.
* **The text highlights the *result* of this lack of socialization: deterioration.**  It mentions that children with ""salvaje"" behavior might suffer from cognitive deterioration or become isolated.
* **Option A directly reflects this deterioration.**

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Comportamiento salvaje ikatu ha’e sa’i socialización rupive (Comportamiento salvaje es solo por falta de socialización):** While lack of socialization is a *cause*, the text doesn't state it's the *only* cause. Abuse and trauma are also mentioned.
* **C: Comportamiento salvaje oiko mitã ojegueraha mombyry rupi (Comportamiento salvaje es causado por ser maltratado):**  Abuse is a *factor*, but the text doesn't exclusively attribute ""salvaje"" behavior to abuse.
* **D: Comportamiento salvaje oiko orekogui tuicha deterioro iñakã rupigui (Comportamiento salvaje causa un deterioro significativo en la comunidad):** The text focuses on the deterioration *within the individual child*, not on the broader community impact.



Therefore, **A** most accurately encapsulates the meaning of ""salvaje"" behavior as described in the provided text."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ko'ãva apytépe ndaha'éi agricultura ojeikove hag̃ua rehegua?","The correct answer is **B: Ojapo tembi'u ohepyme'ẽ hag̃ua**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that traditional agriculture is *not* about using chemical fertilizers. It emphasizes using native seeds and sustainable techniques.
* Option B, ""Ojapo tembi'u ohepyme'ẽ hag̃ua"" (Creating/producing chemical fertilizer), directly contradicts this core principle of traditional agriculture.

Let's look at why the other options are *part* of traditional agriculture, not things that *aren't* part of it:

* **A: Jesareko jehupytýva omyanyhẽ hag̃ua ñemitỹhára ha hogayguakuéra remikotevẽ** (Using hand tools to cultivate the land and involve farmers and their families) - This is a key aspect of traditional agriculture.
* **C: Oñemoambuéva técnica hasy'ỹva omobarete hag̃ua ojehupytýva** (Implementing sustainable techniques to maximize the yield) - This describes the sustainable methods used.
* **D: Jeiporu semilla upe tenda jerepeguáva** (Planting seeds from the local variety) - This is a defining characteristic of traditional agriculture.



Therefore, the only option that represents something *not* part of the described traditional agriculture is creating chemical fertilizers.



"
Mba'épa añete ko'ãva apytépe oiporuva agricultura ojeikove hag̃ua rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha'e sistema orgánico paite**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Agricultura ojeikove haguã hína peteĩ sistema ndahasýiva, jepivérõ orgánico..."" which translates to ""Agriculture is a sustainable system, rather than organic...""  Option A directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **B: Oiporu técnica hasýva omombarete hag̃ua ojehupytýva:** While the text mentions ""técnica hasy'ỹva omobarete haguã ojehupytýva"" (efficient technique to cultivate the land), it's not the defining characteristic of what agriculture *is* according to the text.
* **C: Oipytyvõ umi ñemitỹhárape omboja'o hag̃ua ñemitỹ opa tavapehẽ ndive:** The text mentions that many farmers are becoming self-sufficient, but it doesn't state that agriculture *helps* farmers become self-sufficient *away from cities*.
* **D: Ñemitỹhára oiporu gueteri heta tetã ojeguerojerávape:** This refers to the fact that farmers are globalized, which is mentioned but not the core definition of agriculture.



"
"Museope jeho, mba'e tendápe ho'ata?","The correct answer is **C: Turismo cultural**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly defines **turismo cultural** (cultural tourism) as tourism that allows people to learn about the work and culture of a place.
* It mentions visiting places to learn about history, culture, and local customs.
* The definition of ""turismo kuaapyrã"" (cultural tourism) directly aligns with what the question asks about.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Turismo negocio-gua (Business Tourism):** This refers to tourism related to business, conferences, and trade shows, which isn't the focus of the passage.
* **B: Turismo recreativo (Recreational Tourism):**  While related, it's a broader category. The passage highlights the *cultural* aspect of recreational tourism.
* **D: Turismo okapegua (Adventure Tourism):** This focuses on adventurous activities, which isn't mentioned in the text.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ikatu ha'e mba'e tuichave turista recreativo-pe g̃uarã?","The correct answer is **A: Oikevo hikuái cultura local-pe**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ojehupytyséva jehópe hína ojeikuaa haguã hembiasa ha cultura oguerekóva, upéicharamo upe turismo héra turismo kuaapyrã.""  This translates to: ""In addition, it's possible to learn about the work and culture that exists there, therefore this tourism is called cultural tourism.""

While options B, C, and D are aspects of tourism, the text specifically highlights the importance of learning about the **culture** of a place in relation to cultural tourism. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oipytyvõ tapichakuérape ndokyhyjevéi hag̃ua ñemoambuégui tupão ryepýpe?","The correct answer is **A: Oñemandu’ava’erã ambue guare ñemureko rembiasa ha mba’e osẽ porãva’ekue**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kóva ryepýpe, oñemandu’ava’erã ambue guare ñemureko rembiasa ha mba’e osẽ porãva’ekue oipytyvõva tapichakuérape oipykúivo tape pyahu ha mba’epyahu tupãope g̃uarã.""  This translates to ""In this context, various communication skills and effective approaches are being developed to help people understand the nuances of healthy and destructive relationships.""

Options B, C, and D are related to understanding relationships, but they don't encompass the *action* of developing communication skills and effective approaches that the text highlights as a way to prevent destructive patterns.  While understanding relationships (B & D) and finding supportive communities (C) are helpful, the core solution presented is the development of specific skills (A).



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épe oipytyvõ ojeikuaávo ñane rembiasa tee?","The correct answer is **C: Jeikuaa hag̃ua moõpa hína aty rembiasa ryepýpe** (To understand what constitutes a successful team dynamic).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Oĩ porã jaikuaa ñane rembiasa tee, ha kóva ndaha’éi arandupy ñaikumby katueteva’erãha, hakatu oipytyvõ tapichakuérape oĩ oikuaa hag̃ua moõpa hína aty rembiasa ryepýpe."" (It's good to understand our team dynamic, and this isn't something that's created out of nothing, but it helps people understand what constitutes a successful team dynamic.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndojekyhyjevéi rupi ñemoambuégui** (It's not created out of nothing): While true, this is a broader statement and not the *specific* answer to what understanding team dynamics helps with.
* **B: Oĩ porãva ñemombarete** (Good strength/effectiveness):  The text mentions effectiveness, but the core benefit highlighted is understanding the team dynamic, not just having strength.
* **D: Ñemureko rembiasa porãve** (Perfect team dynamic): The text doesn't suggest a ""perfect"" team dynamic is achievable, but rather understanding what *constitutes* a successful one.

"Ko'ãva apytépe, mávapa ha’e hina umi enfoque posmoderno añetegua ñemoarandurã hag̃ua?","The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ experiencia ñemoarandu rehegua ikatu iporãve ambuegui (An understanding of information is better through experience.)**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the postmodern approach to knowledge emphasizes that there is no single, perfect way to understand something. It highlights the role of personal experience (""experiencia ohasáva temimbo'e kuaapy ojehechaukava kuápe"" - experience that brings knowledge to be shown within us). The examples of TV programs about DIY and crafts illustrate how practical experience is often more effective than abstract information.  The references to researching historical ruins or fixing a household problem reinforce this point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñemoarandandu oikova'erã umi mba'e jaguerovíava oikotaha ñanderehe (Information exists in what we perceive):** While perception is important, this isn't the *core* of the postmodern approach as presented. It's more about the subjectivity of interpretation.
* **C: Peteĩ tape ñemoarandu hag̃ua ikatu iporãve ambuegui (A linear understanding is better than another):** Postmodernism rejects the idea of a linear, logical progression of knowledge.
* **D: Ñemoarandandupe ndaipóri peteĩ tape año (There is no single path to information):**  This is close, but option A is more specific and directly reflects the text's emphasis on the *value of experience* over just the lack of a single path.



Therefore, option A best captures the postmodern perspective on knowledge as outlined in the text.



"
Mba'e ko'ã apytépe ndohechaukái enfoque posmoderno ñemoarandu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñemoarandu ningo oñemboheko hína pe experiencia ohasáva temimbo’e kuaapy ojehechaukava kuápe** (Knowledge is linked to the experience of the sensory perception that is presented to us).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the postmodern approach to knowledge emphasizes the link between knowledge and our sensory experience. It argues that there isn't a single way to understand things perfectly because our experiences shape how we perceive and interpret information.
* Options A, B, and D are related to the text but don't capture the core of the postmodern perspective as well as option C. While the text mentions learning from different sources (related to A), the central point is the interplay between knowledge and sensory experience.  Options B and D focus on the subjectivity of understanding (which is touched upon) but not the fundamental connection to experience itself.

Therefore, option C most accurately reflects the postmodern perspective on knowledge as presented in the text.

"Jepái rire ijehegui ojeke aja, mávapa ko'ã apytépe oñemombytéta jeke interrupción ndive?","The correct answer is **C: Embogueramo alarma nde rupa ykére ha eke jey mokõipa aravo'i rire (Setting an alarm on your phone and waking up after a few hours)**.

Here's why:

* The question describes a sleep disruption where you wake up for a short period (10-60 minutes) and then fall back asleep.  The problem is that the alarm clock is set to wake you up at the scheduled time, *before* you've completed your natural sleep cycle.
* Option C directly addresses this: you set an alarm and wake up after a few hours, indicating a disrupted sleep cycle and the need for an alarm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñemoñe'ẽ peteĩ aravo mbyte peve eke mboyve jey (Talking about a day before waking up)** - This isn't relevant to the sleep disruption described.
* **B: Jahuha jeho ha upéi eñeno jey (Going to bed and then falling asleep)** -  This describes a normal sleep process, not the disrupted one.
* **D: Epu'ã hey'u y peteĩ limétagui oĩva nde rupa ykére (Setting a message on your phone)** - While you *could* set a message, the core of the problem is the alarm clock waking you up at a fixed time despite a disrupted sleep cycle.



"
Mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndaha'éi añete jeke interrupción rehe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndohekái ndemombay'etevõ** (It doesn't prevent you from waking up).

Here's why:

* **The question asks what is *not* a cause of sleep disruption.** The passage describes several things that *do* cause sleep disruption (sleep inertia, medication affecting sleep, etc.).
* **Option B directly states that sleep disruption doesn't prevent waking up.** The passage focuses on the *difficulty waking up* after sleep inertia, not the ability to wake up at all.  The other options all describe factors that contribute to difficulty waking up.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojesarekóva biorritmo-kuéra rehe (Due to biorhythms):** The passage explicitly mentions biorhythms as a factor that can disrupt sleep.
* **C: Jepái ijehegui ojeke aja (When you wake up suddenly):**  Sleep inertia is a sudden awakening, and the passage defines sleep inertia as difficulty waking up after a sudden awakening.
* **D: Ojepayrire ojeheka eke jeyrõ mokõi aravo ohasa mboyve rupi (If you wake up twice in two days):** Waking up twice in two days is a common disruptor of sleep patterns.

"Apytu'ũ oñeha'ãvo oguereko hag̃ua kerayvoty ojekuaa porãva, mba'e oikove?","The correct answer is **D: REM estado periodo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ambue tapicha oimo'ã oguerekóra kerayvoty ojekuaa porãva ha oñemokyre'ỹva oiko py'ỹi haguã ikatu ñanemokane'õ. Ko fenómeno oikove hína umi tembiapokue ñanemandu'avéva oiko REM estado periodo aja.""

Translation: ""Some people who watch TV a lot and are very knowledgeable and informed become more childlike when they are about to fall asleep. This phenomenon occurs in people who are exposed to various media during the REM sleep period.""

This directly links the phenomenon of becoming childlike to the REM sleep period.  While options A, B, and C are related to REM sleep, option D is the most direct and encompassing answer to the question ""Apytu'ũ oñeha'ãvo oguereko hag̃ua kerayvoty ojekuaa porãva, mba'e oikove?"" (What happens when people are exposed to a lot of knowledge and are very informed?).  The answer is that it happens *during* the REM sleep period.



"
Ko'ã mba'e vai apytépe mávapa oiko ñande rete reheve py'ỹi kerayvoty ojekuaa porãva jarekóramo?,"The correct answer is **D: Hetave REM pyharekue (Both REM sleep and dreaming)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the phenomenon of being unable to sleep after watching TV for a while is linked to the REM sleep period.**  It explicitly mentions that during REM sleep, we experience vivid dreams.
* **The passage links the inability to sleep to the brain being ""activated"" by the TV content while in REM sleep.**
* **Therefore, the effect is related to both REM sleep and the dreaming that occurs during it.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sa'i REM estado periodo (Only REM sleep period):**  While REM sleep is *involved*, the passage suggests the *dreaming* aspect within REM is also key.
* **B: REM sa'ive pyharekue (Only REM dreams):** While dreams are important, the passage connects the issue to the brain activity *during* REM sleep, not just the dreams themselves.
* **C: Dependencia kerayvotý rehe (Dependence on television):**  The passage isn't directly claiming a dependence on TV. It's explaining *why* watching TV can disrupt sleep *especially* when you are in REM sleep.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'éichapa umi aty convencional ha internet-pegua ojojogua?","The correct answer is **A: Mokõivéva oreko estándar excelencia reheguáva**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umi aty intenet-pegua py’ỹinte ha’e upe punto ojokupytyhápe aty convencional-pe g̃uarã."" This translates to ""The pinnacle of internet organizations is the point where it aligns with conventional organizations.""  It further mentions ""umi aty intenet-pegua py’ỹinte ha’e upe punto ojokupytyhápe aty convencional-pe g̃uarã."" which aligns with ""Mokõivéva oreko estándar excelencia reheguáva"" (They both have excellence standards).  The passage emphasizes the alignment and standardization.

While options B, C, and D touch on aspects of internet organizations, they are not the core point of how conventional and internet organizations relate according to the text. The text highlights that they have shared excellence standards.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndorekói jokuaa umi aty convencional ha internet-pegua ndive?","The correct answer is **B: Aty internet-pegua py’ỹinte ha’e upe punto ojokupytyhápe aty convencional-pegua**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umi aty internet-pegua py’ỹinte ha’e upe punto ojokupytyhápe aty convencional-pe g̃uarã.""  This translates to: ""The essence of internet-based teams is the point of convergence with conventional teams.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aty convencional ogureko estándar ijyvatevea:** While conventional teams *do* have standards, the text doesn't emphasize this as a key difference *from* internet-based teams. It focuses on the convergence point.
* **C: Aty convencional oreko sa'ive autonomía aty internet-peguagui:** The text says the internet-based teams gain autonomy *from* conventional teams, not the other way around.
* **D: Aty internet-pegua ikatu ijaty opa aravópe:**  The text says internet-based teams can work in *all* locations, but it doesn't characterize this as a defining difference from conventional teams. It's more about the teamwork structure.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what is *not* a component of content theories of motivation.** The passage describes these theories as focusing on what drives people to action.
* **Options A, B, and C** all directly relate to what the passage states as core elements of content theories:
    * **A:**  The idea of striving for self-actualization (reaching one's full potential) is a key element of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
    * **B:** This describes the impact of experiences on future behavior, a central concept in content theories.
    * **C:**  Content theories focus on the needs or desires that *motivate* people.
* **Option D** describes the *observation* of what attracts people, not a *component* *of* the theories themselves. The theories try to *explain* *why* people are attracted to certain things, not just that they are attracted.

Therefore, ""Jeikuaa mba'épa tapichakuéra oñeñandu hag̃ua atraído"" (Knowing what people are attracted to) is the element that is not a component of content theories of motivation.

"Ko'ã apytépe, mávapa ndaha'éi tercio mbojojaha rehegua?","The correct answer is **A: Ejapo peteĩ línea base pe tenda ikatuhápe oñemohenda pe sujeto (It creates a base line for the camera to stabilize the subject)**.

Here's why:

* **Tercio Mbojojaha (Rule of Thirds)** is a compositional guideline that suggests dividing an image into nine equal parts with two horizontal and two vertical lines. The key is to place important elements along these lines or at their intersections.

Let's break down why the other options *are* related to the Rule of Thirds:

* **B: Omoheñói tekove ha kyre'ỹ ta’ãnga guive (It facilitates the framing of landscapes):** The Rule of Thirds is *particularly useful* for landscape photography, helping to create balanced and visually appealing compositions.
* **C: Ojapo tenda mba’e oguenohẽséva renda iporãvévaha’eha (It creates a frame that enhances the visual appeal):** This is the core function of the Rule of Thirds - to create a more visually engaging and balanced image by providing a frame.
* **D: Omboheko ta'ãnga (It creates a composition):**  The Rule of Thirds *is* a method of creating a composition.

Option A describes a camera stabilization technique that is independent of the Rule of Thirds. While good camera stabilization is important for photography in general, it's not a characteristic *of* the Rule of Thirds itself.  The Rule of Thirds is about *composition*, not about stabilizing the camera.



"
Mávapa ndaha'éi formato de fotografía 35mm rehegua?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndojejoguái heta formato común ndive relación de aspecto-re**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Heta formato común (formato aty APS techapyrã) ojuehegua térã ojojogua relación de aspecto orekóva rupive."" which translates to ""Many common formats (like the APS crop format) have a different aspect ratio."" This directly contradicts option C, which says they *don't* have the aspect ratio.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojeiporu gueteri ko’ág̃a peve:**  This translates to ""It can be used to develop at home."" The text mentions this as a benefit of the 35mm format.
* **B: Heko ojeiporu avei ko’ág̃a umi cámara digital formato-pe:** This translates to ""It can also be used in digital cameras with image sensor formats."" The text explicitly discusses how the 35mm format relates to digital cameras.
* **D: Ha'e formato de fotografía de imágenes fijas ojeikuaavéva arapýpe:** This translates to ""It is a format of still photography used in a wide range."" The text defines the 35mm format as a still photography format used in a wide range.



Therefore, only option C is incorrect according to the text.

Here's why:

The question asks *how* zoom lenses overcome the disadvantage of fixed focal length lenses. The text states that a key advantage of zoom lenses is their ability to **zoom in on distant subjects that would require a fixed focal length lens with a different focal length**.  Options A, B, and D are incorrect based on the information provided in the text.  Option C directly addresses how zoom lenses offer versatility in reaching different distances.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, araka’épa ikatu ojepuru peteĩ objetivo zoom peteĩ objetivo fijo rãngue?","The correct answer is **A: Ojeikotevẽveramo apertura máxima** (By adjusting the maximum aperture).

Here's why:

* **The text states that a disadvantage of zoom lenses is that they often have a smaller maximum aperture.** This means they let in less light than fixed focal length lenses.
* **To compensate for this smaller aperture, you need to adjust the aperture setting (f-stop) on the zoom lens.**  You can often achieve similar exposure to a fixed lens by selecting a slightly wider aperture on the zoom lens (like f/2.8 instead of f/1.8) – although this might impact the depth of field.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Reipotáramo sa'ive elemento objetivo rehegua** (By adjusting the individual lens elements): While lens elements are crucial for image quality, adjusting them doesn't directly solve the light-gathering problem caused by a smaller maximum aperture.
* **C: Ndereipuruséiramo flash hesakãpora’ỹhápe** (By not using flash):  Avoiding flash might help in some situations, but it's not a general solution.  You still need sufficient light, and a zoom lens with a smaller aperture will struggle.
* **D: Ehekáramo complejidad focal** (By ignoring focal length complexity): Focal length complexity is a *feature* of zoom lenses, not a way to overcome the smaller maximum aperture.

Máva ko'ãva apytégui ndaha'éichene peteĩ techapyrehai misticismo rehegua?,"The best answer is **A: Ñemomorãramo omomba’eve rehe pe experiencia personal ojeguerekóva peteĩ estado de conciencia heko py’aguapyvéva ha ivy’a pypukukuaáva rehe.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what is *not* part of the definition of mysticism.**
* The provided text defines mysticism as an experience of a heightened state of consciousness, often involving feelings of bliss, ecstasy, and transcendence.
* Option A directly reflects this core definition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ohapykuehóva oheka peteĩ conocimiento consciente peteĩ angapy añete** - While mysticism can involve knowledge, the text emphasizes *direct experience* rather than purely intellectual knowledge. Also, 'angapy añete' (a third divinity) is a specific belief and not a universal part of the definition.
* **C: Ohapykuehóva oheka peteĩ mba’e ojejapokuaáva otopa hag̃ua realidad divina** - Similar to B, mysticism is more about the *experience* of divine reality, not necessarily a specific action *to* perceive it.
* **D: Ñemomorãramo experiencia personal jeheka ikatu oñembojoja ambue hendaichagua jeroviapy ndive** - This option is contradictory. Mysticism *is* about personal experience and transcendence *beyond* ordinary experiences.

Therefore, option A is the only one that aligns with the provided definition of mysticism and represents something *included* in the definition, not excluded.  The question asks what is *not* part of the definition. It's a trick question framed poorly. A more accurate question would be ""Which of these is a component of the definition of mysticism?""



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ndohekái miticismo?","The correct answer is **C: Omomba’eve peteĩ estado de conciencia ipeteĩva rehe, ko’ýte umi heko ivy’a pypukukuaáva rehe.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Misticismo ikatu ojehecha ambue hendaichagua jeroviapy ha iñemomorãramo omomba’eve rehe pe experiencia personal ojeguerekóva peteĩ estado de conciencia ipeteĩva rehe, ko’ýte umi heko py’aguapyvéva, hembihechakuaa, ivy’a pypukukuaáva rehe.""

This translates to: ""Mysticism seeks various means and aims to foster personal experiences that arise from a heightened state of consciousness, such as feelings of bliss, ecstasy, and rapture.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oheka realidad divina (It seeks divine reality):** While mysticism *can* seek divine reality, the text describes it as seeking a *heightened state of consciousness* that *leads* to encounters with divine reality, rather than directly seeking it as the primary goal.
* **B: Oheka jehechakuaa atýpe (It seeks self-awareness):** Self-awareness can be *a result* of a mystical experience, but the text isn't solely focused on self-awareness. It describes a broader range of experiences.
* **D: Conocimiento consciente Dios jeheka rehe (Conscious knowledge of God):** The text doesn't necessarily frame mystical experience as ""conscious knowledge."" It focuses more on the *experience* itself, which can be beyond conscious knowledge.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ikatu omoñepyrũ raka'e ñemitỹregua aty?","The correct answer is **B: Moriori Islas Chatham-gua**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Avei oĩ ambue tribu islas Chatham-pegua, ha’éva maoríes oúva Nueva Zelanda-gui. Ha’ekuéravoi ojehero Moriori..."" which translates to ""There was also another tribe in the Chatham Islands, which were Maori who came from New Zealand. They were called Moriori...""

The question asks who *initiated* the formation of the community. While the Maori originated in Polynesia and migrated to New Zealand, the Moriori specifically formed their community *on the Chatham Islands* after migrating *from New Zealand*.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, pueblo ojekáva hikuái moas ha'e avakuéra oĩ’ypyva’ekue moõ?","The correct answer is **A: Continente-gua**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Aveí oĩ ambue tribu islas Chatham-pegua, ha’éva maoríes oúva Nueva Zelanda-gui. Ha’ekuéravoi ojehero Moriori, oĩmimi ñorãirõ ha ipahápe, Umi Moriori ojejukapaite.""  This translates to: ""There were also other tribes in the Chatham Islands, who were Maori from New Zealand. They were called Moriori, they were shy and peaceful, the Moriori ended up being wiped out.""

The text then contrasts this with another theory: ""Hakatu, oĩ jeikuaa pyahu he’íva umi Moriori ha’ehague peteĩ maoríes aty continente-pegua ohova’ekue Nueva Zelanda-gui Islas Chatham-pe, ha omoakarapu’ã hikuái arandukuaa pyahu omomba’éva chupekuéra."" This translates to: ""However, a recent discovery suggests that the Moriori were a Maori group that migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands on the continent, and were wiped out by a severe plague.""

The key phrase is ""...peteĩ maoríes aty continente-pegua ohova’ekue Nueva Zelanda-gi Islas Chatham-pe..."" which directly translates to ""...a Maori group that migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands on the continent...""

Therefore, the Moriori were a Maori group that migrated *from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands on the continent*, making them continental-based.
"
Ko'ã apytégui mba'épe oipytyvõta Origame yvy tee jeiporu carpeta-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Carpeta hembiasa ha omỹikuaa.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ojapo va'ekue Jonh Smith 1970 década-pe oipytyvõ haguã carpeta hembiasa'ỹva térã omyikuaa porã'ỹvape.""  This translates to ""He created a workbook or a well-illustrated folder in the 1970s.""

* **Option B directly reflects this:** ""Carpeta hembiasa ha omỹikuaa"" means ""Workbook and well-illustrated/well-presented folder.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Carpeta ojapose hetave pliegue ohovo:** ""The folder makes many folds"" - While origami involves folding, the primary purpose mentioned is the creation of the folder itself.
* **C: Carpeta ojapo origami pliegue ypy gotyogua oikotevẽva:** ""The folder makes origami folds of a triangular shape"" - This describes a *type* of origami, not the function of the folder.
* **D: Carpeta oha'ãva'ekue peteĩ téra mokõi vece ramo:** ""The folder has a box that is doubled"" - This is not mentioned in the text.



"
Mávapa ndaha'éi añete origami yvy tee rehegua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndoikotevẽi pliegue ypy gotyogua** (It doesn't have a triangular fold).

Here's why:

The text states: ""ha opa pliegue oguereko tenda ndahasýiva"" (and all folds have a hollow).  It *also* states: ""pliegue ypy gotyoguáicha"" (a triangular fold).

Option B directly contradicts the text's description of origami.  All origami folds *do* involve a triangular fold.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha'e umi hembiasa porãvape g̃uarã** (It is useful for work): The text says origami was developed to help with work or organize papers.
* **C: Opa pliegue oguereko tenda ndahasýiva** (Not all folds have a hollow): The text explicitly states all folds *do* have a hollow.
* **D: Omacha carpeta omyikuaa porã'ỹvape g̃uarã** (It's useful for organizing papers): The text says it was initially developed to help with work or organize papers.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva ko'ã tenda apytépe ndojehe'ái Valle del Indio civilización rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The text states: ""añetehápe ojehero va’erã kuri civilizción Indo-Sarasvati, upeicha héra rupi tenda ojejo’o ypyhague 1920 década-pe."" This translates to ""another civilization is called the Indo-Sarasvati civilization, and the first settlements to be discovered in the 1920s were called Harappa.""  Therefore, Harappa is the name of the first discovered settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization.
"
Mávapa ko’ãvagui noñe’ẽi peteĩ téra ikatuha ojehero pe Civilización Edad de Bronce rehe oñeñe’ẽva’ekue pe maranduhaipe?,"The correct answer is **D: Valle del Indo-pegua civilización**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Valle del Indo-pegua civilización ningo ou Edad de Bronce-gui..."". This means the passage *defines* the Valle del Indo-pegua civilization. The question asks what the text *talks about* in relation to the Bronze Age civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Civilización Harappa:** Harappa is a *specific city* within the Valle del Indo-pegua civilization, not the civilization itself. The text mentions Harappa by name, but it's not the main subject being defined.
* **B: Civilización Indo-Sarasvati:** The text mentions the possibility of an Indo-Sarasvati civilization, but it's presented as an alternative theory, not the primary focus.
* **C: Civilización Río Indo:** While the civilization is associated with the Indus River, the text uses the more complete term ""Valle del Indo-pegua civilización"" to refer to it.

Therefore, the passage's main topic concerning the Bronze Age civilization is the **Valle del Indo-pegua civilización**.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva ko'ã apytégui iporãve?","The correct answer is **C: Hechakuaave mba'épa sa'iveháva oikotevẽ, opavave rãngue (Understanding what is being said, being attentive)**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks which of the options is the best.
* **The first sentence (P)** explains that communication relies on understanding what the other person is saying.  It highlights the importance of attentive listening.
* **Option C** directly addresses this core idea.  It emphasizes *understanding what is being said* and being *attentive* to it.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ñamba'apo oñondivepa (Working with understanding):** This is a consequence of understanding, not the act of understanding itself.
* **B: Nde eipotávante emomba'eguasuve (Being polite while speaking):** Politeness is important, but not the primary focus of good communication as outlined in P.
* **D: Mba'epotarasa ikatu omacha (What is the meaning of the question?):** This is irrelevant to the core point being made about effective communication.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate reflection of the importance of understanding in achieving good communication.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ikatu oĩ omotenondevéva oñecentráramo umi beneficio pya’e oúvare?","The correct answer is **A: Altruista**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the type of person who focuses on the benefit of others to achieve a desired outcome.** The initial statement describes how someone who understands this can achieve better results.
* **Altruism** is defined as selfless concern for the well-being of others.  Altruistic people prioritize the benefit of others, even if it means less direct benefit for themselves.  This aligns perfectly with the question's premise.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Jecolabora (Collaborative):** While collaboration involves working with others, it doesn't necessarily imply prioritizing *their* benefit above all else.  Collaboration can be driven by self-interest as well.
* **C: Ñemba'apo oñondive (Self-interest):**  This is the opposite of what the question describes.  Self-interest focuses on personal gain.
* **D: Peteĩmembánte (Individualistic):**  This refers to a focus on oneself and one's own goals, which is also the opposite of prioritizing the benefit of others.



Therefore, **Altruista** best captures the essence of the person described and the motivation behind achieving a desired outcome by focusing on others."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ohepyme'ẽ hetaiterei ñorairõ-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Filipinas retä rekuái (The Philippines territory)**.

The text states that the US imperialism involved the Philippines territory (""Imperialismo estadounidense ñorãirõ Pilipinas-pe oike hag̃ua repy, ohepyme’ẽ’ẽ Filipinas retãyguakuéra jeýnte""). The question asks what was linked together by this imperialism.  The text then elaborates on how this link occurred through taxation and debt.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wall Street casa bancaria (Wall Street banks):** While Wall Street banks were involved in the financial aspect of the imperialism, the primary thing linked together was the territory itself.
* **C: Estados Unidos régimen colonial (United States colonial regime):**  The colonial regime *enacted* the imperialism, but it wasn't the *thing* being linked.
* **D: Filipinas retãyguakuéra (The people of the Philippines):** The people of the Philippines were affected by the imperialism, but the core link was the territory.

Mba'e periodo oú raka'e Templario-kuéra época mboyve?,"The correct answer is **A: Baja Edad Media (Late Middle Ages)**.

This translates to: ""The events are known from the High Middle Ages, during Europe's period of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD). The High Middle Ages is followed by the Early Middle Ages and then the **Late Middle Ages**...""

Therefore, the Templars' era falls within the Late Middle Ages.
"
Mba'e periodo tepa oú Templario-kuéra época rire?,"The correct answer is **C: Alta Edad Media (High Middle Ages)**.

The text states that the Knights Templar originated during the High Middle Ages, specifically in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 d.C.). While the other options touch on parts of that timeframe, the broader period encompassed by the High Middle Ages is the most accurate.
"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ojapokuaa hikuái amputación oñangareko haguã paciente-kuérape gangrena-gui..."" which translates to ""They frequently performed amputations to save patients from gangrene...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sedante estrés postraumatico-pe g̃uarã:** While the text mentions sedatives, it doesn't connect them to post-traumatic stress.
*   **B: Herbano ra'ỹigui onohe hag̃ua escopolamina:** The text mentions escopolamine as a herbal remedy, but it doesn't say they *used* it to treat PTSD.
*   **C: Ojoko hag̃ua tyguy rape pinza arterial-kuéra guive:** The text mentions using arterial clamps, but it doesn't directly link this to the reasons for the failure of the Roman medical system.

The fact that amputations were frequently performed *despite* being a drastic measure points to a significant failure in the Roman medical system to effectively treat infections like gangrene, which is a key aspect of their medical limitations.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ndopytyvõgui ojeguerojera hag̃ua ñepohãnokuéra Imperio Romano jave?","The correct answer is **C: Ñemoarandu médico atýpe (Medical knowledge)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Roman soldiers were aided in healing due to their **medical knowledge**. It mentions surgeons knowing about sedatives, morphine (from opium), and scopolamine (from henbane), and performing amputations. 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Cuerpo Médico (Medical Corps):** While the medical corps existed, the text emphasizes the knowledge *within* the corps, not just its existence.
* **B: Imperio-gua militarista política mbarete (Powerful militaristic empire):**  While the empire's strength and military structure contributed, the core reason for healing was the medical expertise.
* **D: Pohãnoharakuéra oike ñepyrũ recluta-ramo emperador rupi (Recruits enlisting with the emperor):**  Recruitment was necessary, but it didn't directly contribute to the healing process itself. It provided the soldiers who *benefited* from the medical knowledge.



Therefore, the best answer is **C** because the text highlights the medical knowledge of the soldiers and surgeons as the primary factor aiding their healing."
Mba'e oñeikotevẽ jehecha hag̃ua,"The correct answer is **C: Jeñandu ambue onda pukukue (It analyzes various waves)**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** ""...oñandu ambue onda pukukue..."" This directly translates to ""...it analyzes various waves...""  This is a key function of the visual system.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Temiandu órgano sistema visual-pegua (The visual system's internal organs):** While the text *mentions* the internal organs, it doesn't say that's *what is observed* during the process.
* **B: Ojesarekóvo ambue tapicha organismo rehe (Available for other organisms):**  This describes availability, not a core function of the process itself.
* **D: Oguereko jehecha porã iñambuéva (Provides clear vision):** While clear vision is the *result*, the text describes what happens *during* the process that leads to clear vision, not just the final outcome.
"
Mba’épa odepende pe variación tesa estructura rehegua umi organismo apytépe?,"The correct answer is **A: Sensibilidad onda pukukue rehegua**.

Here's why:

* **The text states that the initial development of the visual system has multiple effects, including developing specific wave sensitivities and enabling good vision.**  The options directly relate to the outcomes of the development.
* **Option A, ""Sensibilidad onda pukukue rehegua"" (Wave sensitivity), is a direct consequence and key aspect of how the visual system functions.**  It refers to the ability to detect different wavelengths of light, which is fundamental to seeing color and distinguishing objects.
* **Option B, ""Ojesarekóvo ambue tapicha organismo rehe"" (Being able to be used in other organisms),** while true, is not the *primary* impact of the initial development. It's a potential application, not a fundamental characteristic.
* **Option C, ""Oguereko jehecha porã iñambuéva"" (Having good vision),** is an outcome *resulted from* the wave sensitivity, but not the initial development's core effect.
* **Option D, ""Hasykue iñambueva organismo kuerape"" (The organism having a developing eye),** describes the process of development but doesn't explain *what* the early development accomplishes.



Therefore, **sensibilidad onda pukukue rehegua** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

This translates to: ""Guru is a guide in the religions of India, but in Sikhism, it refers to the one that defines the Sikh religion.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Sijismo oñepyrũ tradición indu oñemboja’o rire:** While true, this is a general fact and not the *primary* point the question is asking about.
* **C: Guru Nanak rire ou porundy ambue guru ojoapykuéri:** This is also true and a significant event, but the question asks what the passage *specifically* says about Sikhism itself.
* **D: Sijismo he’i avei ouhague hikuái hinduismogui:** This is true but the passage highlights that Sikhism *defines* the Guru's role differently than in Hinduism. Therefore, the definition of the Guru is a more crucial detail.

This translates to: ""Guru is a person devoted to the way of life in the Indian subcontinent, but in Sikhism, it is the one who embodies the essence of the Sikh faith.""  Therefore, the Guru is what defines Sikhism.

The other options are also mentioned as things children with ADHD struggle with, but the text specifically says they *cannot* perform work-related tasks.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'ére mitã orekova Transtorno Déficit de atención rehegua ojapo tembiapo orekóva riesgo?","The correct answer is **D: Omokyre'ỹ hag̃ua iñapytu'ũ (They are prone to impulsive actions).**

This directly links impulsivity (omokyre'ỹ hag̃ua iñapytu'ũ) to taking risks. The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: Isa'ive hag̃ua hiperactiviad (Due to hyperactivity):** While hyperactivity is a symptom of TDA, the text focuses on impulsivity as the primary reason for risky behavior.
*   **B: Ojoaju hag̃ua iñirũnguéra ndive (Because they are prone to being distracted):** Distractibility is a symptom, but not directly linked to taking risks in the text.

"Ko maranduhai rupive, máva ko’ãvaguipa ndaha'éi peteĩ techapyrã andamio rehegua?","The correct answer is **D: Peteĩ entrenador liga menor-pegua (A smaller league coach)**.

Here's why:

The text states that scaffolding (""andamio"") is *not* a method for teaching a whole new subject. It's a method to help people learn a *new skill* within a larger, familiar context. 

An entrenador liga menor-pegua (a smaller league coach) is analogous to scaffolding. They help someone learn a specific skill (like a particular play in a sport) within the framework of the game itself. They don't teach the entire sport from scratch.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jehechauka ñembosarái mboyve computadora-pe (Checking a computer forum):** This is a way to *find information*, not a structured learning method like scaffolding.
* **B: SAT mbo'ehára (SAT tutor):**  A tutor *could* provide scaffolding, but the text isn't specifically talking about tutoring.  The role of a tutor is broader than the role of scaffolding described.
* **C: Peteĩ programa de estudio independiente (An independent study program):** An independent study program often covers a whole subject on its own.  Scaffolding is *not* a complete subject; it's a support system *within* a subject.



Therefore, **D** is the best analogy to the text's description of what scaffolding *isn't*.

* The text explicitly states: ""Andamio ikatu **peteĩ método oipytyvõva umi tapicha oguerekóva peteĩ tembiasa pyahu kuaapyrãme**..."" (Scaffolding is a method that helps people who are learning a new concept...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Andamio ikatu ha’e virtual:** While the text mentions virtual scaffolding, it's not the *definition* of scaffolding.  It's just one characteristic.
* **B: Ha'e peteĩ método oipytyvõva umi tapicha, ndaha'éi peteĩ método kuaapyrã:** The text says it *is* a scaffolding method (peteĩ método kuaapyrã). The statement is incorrect.
* **C: Oje'e avei chupe Kuaapy oñemopyendáva apopyrã:** While the text *mentions* scaffolding in the context of programing (Kuaapy oñemopyendáva apopyrã), this isn't the definition of scaffolding itself.

Therefore, option D accurately captures the core concept of scaffolding as described in the text.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oreko MySpace ikatuva opytyvõ temimbo'ekuérape?","The correct answer is **B: Blogs**.

The text explicitly mentions that MySpace allows users to have their own ""página internet"" (website/page) where they can share ""heta jesareko"" (many posts/content), and mentions ""heta terã sa'ive sa'y kuéra ojeipotaháicha"" (many different types of content are created). This strongly implies the existence of blogs or similar content-sharing features.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikatu oñemoĩ porãve** (It's very easy to): This is too general and doesn't specify a particular feature.
*   **C: Peteĩ direccion internet pegua** (On a website address): This is true, but not what MySpace *does* for you.  It's a consequence of using the platform.
*   **D: 54 millon perfil** (54 million profiles): This is a statistic about the platform's size, not a feature it offers users.

Here's why:

The text states that after the protests, Krushchev used tanks to suppress the rebellion and then *appointed Wladyslaw Gomulka as prime minister*. This was his response to the crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oguerahauka tanque ojoko hag̃ua sarambi** (He used tanks to crush the rebellion) - This was *part of* his response, but not the primary action that occurred *after* the protests.
* **C: Ohupi tembiapo repy** (He started work/development) - This isn't mentioned as an action Krushchev took in response to the protests.
* **D: Omonĩ upépe ojejeruréva** (He deployed the military) - This is a more general description of using tanks, and less specific than appointing a prime minister.
"
Mávapa ndaha'éi peteĩ causa oiko haguére guerosapukái Polonia-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Comunismo (Communism)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the initial protests in Poland in 1956 were sparked by the promise of reforms from Krushchev, specifically regarding better living conditions and more work opportunities.  However, the protests escalated into a general protest *against communism*.  The government's response, using tanks and ultimately installing Gomulka, was a direct result of the communist regime being challenged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hesa’ipa hi’upyrã (Better living conditions)** - This was a *reason* for the initial protests, not the primary cause.
* **C: Tembiapo repy (More work opportunities)** - Similar to B, this was a motivating factor, not the fundamental cause.
* **D: Oñemoi hag̃ua Wladyslaw Gomulka primer ministro ramo (Installing Wladyslaw Gomulka as Prime Minister)** - This was a *consequence* of the protests, not the cause.  It was a way to try and quell the unrest, not the reason it began.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that despite the shared enemy, the Soviet Union and the United States had fundamentally different **political systems, processes, and cultures**. This difference was a major factor in the Cold War.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cultura joavy (Popular culture):** While cultural differences existed, the passage doesn't highlight popular culture as a key area of disagreement or conflict between the two superpowers.
* **B: Oje'eva Alemania rehe (Regarding Germany):** Germany is mentioned as a nation affected by the conflict, but not as a point of contention *between* the US and USSR's political systems.
* **C: Proceso iñambue ojoehegui (Process of emergence):** The passage mentions processes, but doesn't say they were a point of disagreement. The core issue was the *nature* of the political systems themselves.



Therefore, the fundamental difference in **political system** is the key factor the passage emphasizes regarding the US and USSR."
Ko'ã apytéguipa mba'e ndohechaukahai mba'erã ojeguerahauka impulso nervioso ava rete rupive?,"The correct answer is **B: Osyryry katui hag̃ua tuguy**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *triggers* the nerve impulse. The text states: ""Sistema nervioso ojoko homeostasis-pe, oguerahauka rupi impulso nervioso ava rete rupive osyryry katui hag̃ua tuguy...""  This translates to ""The nervous system, to maintain homeostasis, triggers a nerve impulse to transmit signals through the body...""

The word ""oguerahauka"" (triggers) directly points to the action that starts the nerve impulse. The phrase ""osyryry katui hag̃ua tuguy"" (to transmit signals through the body) describes the *result* of the trigger, not the trigger itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mbegueve osyryry hag̃ua tuguy** (To maintain homeostasis): This is the *purpose* of the nervous system's action, not what triggers the nerve impulse.
* **C: Ojoko homeostasis-pe** (To maintain homeostasis): Similar to A, this is the reason for the action, not the trigger.
* **D: Oipytyvõva rete jeikove oimeraẽ amenaza oguerekóvagui** (Helps the body recognize threats): This is a *consequence* of the nerve impulse, not the trigger itself.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**.
"
Mba'e ikatu ejuhu Meseta de Giza-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Tumba**.

The text states: ""Meseta de Giza, térã """"Necrópolis de Giza"""" oĩva Valle de los Muertos de Egipto-pe, oreko heta pirámide (gran pirámide hína pe ijapytepekuéra tuichavéva), heta templo ha gran Esfinge.

The text explicitly mentions ""tumba"" (tomb) as something found on the Giza Plateau. While the other options are also present (pyramids, temples, Great Sphinx), the question asks what *can* be found there, and tombs are listed.
"
Mba'erã ojejapo raka'e pe Gran Piramide?,"The correct answer is **B: Oñemopu’ã oñemomorã hag̃ua faraón** (It was built to honor the pharaoh).

The text clearly states: ""Gran pirámide oñemopu’ã oñemomorã hag̃ua faraón Khufu..."" which translates to ""The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiko hag̃ua chugui peteĩ siete maravillas apytépe** (It was built as one of the seven wonders): While the pyramid *is* one of the seven wonders, the text explains its *purpose*, not just its status.
* **C: Oiko hag̃ua tenda ojekuaava ramo** (It was built as a place to worship): The text mentions temples, but the *main* purpose of the pyramid itself was to honor the pharaoh.
* **D: Oñeñongatu hag̃ua tumba umi omanova'ekue mba'e** (It was built to house the tombs of deceased things):  While the pyramid *contains* a tomb, the text emphasizes its role in *honoring* the pharaoh, not just being a tomb.
"
Máva ha'e responsable ko árape ñande jaikuaa hag̃ua tarendype oñehundi hague templo?,"The correct answer is **C: Estrabón**.

The text states: ""Grecia-gua Estrabón ohai tenondeve, ha’eha ko árape ojeikuaaháicha."" This translates to ""The Greek Strabo provided the account, and he is the one who made this known."" Therefore, Strabo is responsible for us knowing about the temple's destruction on that date.
"
Máva ko'ãva apytépe ha'e peteĩ mba’e añete oñemopu'ã jey haguére Artemisa templo?,"The correct answer is **A: Alejandro Magno ñemopu'ã repy ojehepyme'ẽ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Alejandro, rey-ramo, oikuave’ẽ pe templo ñemopu’ã repy jehepyme’ẽ, katu oñembotove chupe.""  This translates to: ""Alexander, the king, was ashamed of the temple's poor state, but he did not rebuild it."" However, later it says ""Uperire, Alejandro omano rire, pe templo oñemopu’ã jey 323 a.C."" (Afterwards, upon Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.). 

The question asks about the *first* time the temple was rebuilt. The text indicates that Alejandro Magno initiated the rebuilding effort, although he didn't finish it.  The rebuilding was completed *after* his death. Therefore, Alejandro Magno's *attempt* to rebuild is the more accurate answer to the question of the first rebuilding effort.
"
"Ko maranduai he’iháicha, araka'e guive ikatu ra'e peteĩ especie oguata hetyma ári?","The correct answer is **A: 7 millon arýma**.

The passage states: ""Sahelanthropus ikatúma ra'e oguara hetyma ári ojapóma 7 millóna arýma."" (Sahelanthropus could have walked upright 7 million years ago.)
"
Máva ko'ãva especie pa'ũme oguatama raka'e hetyma ári?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sahelanthropus ikatúma ra'e oguara hetyma ári ojapóma 7 millóna arýma."" This translates to ""Sahelanthropus could have walked upright 7 million years ago.""  The other options are incorrect:

*   **Homo Erectus:** The passage says Homo Erectus is known to have walked upright from 2 million years ago.
*   **Pýpe jeguata:** This means ""early hominids"" and is a general term, not a specific species.
*   **Australopithecus:** The passage states Australopithecus is not as likely to have walked upright like humans.



"
Mba'épa oheka raka'e marina Alemania-gua Tetãnguéra Ñorãirõ guasu mokõihápe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ojoko Gran Bretaña-gui hetãygua ha mba'erepykuéra** (They intercept goods and materials from Great Britain).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Alemania-gua marina, oiporúvo submarino-kuéra, oñeha'ã kuri ojoko upe tráfico."" (The German navy, using submarines, began intercepting that traffic.)
* ""Upe tráfico"" refers to the traffic *from* Great Britain, meaning goods and materials being transported *to* Great Britain.
* Option B directly reflects this interception of goods and materials.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojoko hag̃ua mba'e repy oúva Gran Bretaña-gui** (They intercept goods arriving in Great Britain) - This is the opposite of what the passage describes. They are intercepting goods *leaving* Great Britain.
* **C: Omongu'e material oceano Atlántico rupive** (They transport materials from the Atlantic ocean) - While Germany did transport materials, the passage focuses on their *intercepting* of traffic.
* **D: Ojoko tapichakuéra ha material ñemongu'e Estados Unidos-gui** (They intercept people and materials transported from the United States) - The passage mentions US aid to Great Britain, but the German navy's focus was on traffic *from* Great Britain.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa orekove éxito batalla naval-pe campaña Atlantico Norte jave?","The correct answer is **D: Gran Bretaña**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Aliado-kuéra oguereko rire fracaso upépe, Alemania ikatúne kuri ojapyhu Gran Bretaña ojapohaguéicha Europa tuichakuépe."" This translates to: ""If the Allies had failed, Germany could have invaded Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.""

This implies that the Allies, primarily Great Britain and the United States, *succeeded* in preventing Germany from invading.  The campaign was a success for the Allies. While the US played a crucial role, the text specifically highlights the threat to Great Britain and Germany's ambitions towards the rest of Europe, emphasizing Great Britain as a key element in the campaign's outcome.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate based on the provided text.
"
Mba'e ndaipóri gueteri kuri asirio ogueroikémaro guare caballería?,"The correct answer is **A: Kalcha jeguapyrã (Well-trained horses)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hakatu ndoguerekói gueteri ikalcha jeguapyrã, upévare caballería asiria oñorairõ kavaju nandi ári gueteri."" which translates to: ""However, they did not have well-trained horses, therefore the Assyrian cavalry rode on donkeys.""

Therefore, the Assyrians lacked well-trained horses.
"
Mba'éicha oiko ñorairö orekóva caballería?,"The correct answer is **C: Cabaju ári** (On horseback).

The text explicitly states: ""Caballería ha’e peteĩ ejército oñorairõva kavaju ári."" which translates to ""Cavalry is an army that is trained on horseback.""
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, moõ kuri nderetopamõ'ái Babilonio-kuéra ndaha'éiva pa'i rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Ojapo sacrificio tupão korapy nandipe** (They made sacrifices to the god with a lion's head).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Umi babilonio-kuéra omopu’ã peteĩ teĩ itupãkuérapeg̃uarã peteĩ tupão ha’evéva ojeheróva tupã roga. Avakuéra ojapo sacrificio tupãkuérapeg̃uarã ha pa’ikuéra oñeha’ã oñangareko tupãkuéra remikotevẽ ñembo’e ha jeroky rupive."" (The Babylonians made a temple for a god that resembled a lion. They made sacrifices to the gods and the people hoped to be heard and answered by the gods.)

Option A directly reflects this statement about offering sacrifices to a god depicted with a lion's head. The other options are not supported by the text."
Máva ko'ã apytépe ha'e pa'i añónte g̃uarã?,"The correct answer is **B: Tupã renda tupão ryepýpe**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Peteĩ teĩ tupão oguereko korapy nandi ha upéi peteĩ tupã renda hyepýpe ikatuhápe oike pa’ikuéra añónte.""  This translates to: ""One god had a winged serpent and then people could enter his temple through the god's wings.""  Therefore, the temple (or more accurately, the space *within* the temple, accessed through the god's wings) is where people could reach the gods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jeroky (Sacrifice):** While sacrifice was part of Babylonian religious practice, the passage describes *how* people accessed the gods, not what they offered.
* **C: Ñembo'e (Prayer):**  Prayer was likely part of Babylonian religious practice, but the passage describes a physical entry point to the gods.
* **D: Zigurats:** Zigurats were temples, but the passage describes the *entrance* to the gods, specifically through the god's wings within the temple.
"
Araka'e rire oñemomba’eguasueterei Rey Tutankamón-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ojejuhu rire he'õngue renda (When his tomb was discovered)**.

The text states: ""Hakatu, he’õngue renda jejuhu 1922-pe, omomba’eguasueteri ichupe."" which translates to ""However, when his tomb was discovered in 1922, it became famous.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Araka'e rire oñemomba’eguasueterei Rey Tutankamón-pe? (Why did King Tutankhamun become famous?)** While true, this is the question being answered, not the reason *when* he became famous.
* **B: Ha'e Rey jave (He is a King)**  This is a basic fact, but the text focuses on the *discovery* making him famous.
* **D: Héra oĩ rupi rey-kuéra réra rysýi ymave guarépe (His name exists among kings who are revered)** This refers to the historical reverence, not the specific event that catapulted him to fame.



"
Mba'e ojejapo Rey Tutankamón-gui peteĩ rey ojekuaavéva Egipto-gua?,"The correct answer is **C: Oñemonda rupi heta mba'e he'õngue rendagui** (Many treasures were found).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Hakatu, he’õngue renda jejuhu 1922-pe, omomba’eguasueteri ichupe. Heta te’õngue renda ymaguaréva oñemonda, kóva katu ojejuhu aimete oĩhaguéichaite."" (However, in 1922, much more was discovered, greatly increasing his fame. Many valuable treasures were found, and this one was found as if it were newly made.)

This clearly indicates that the discovery of many treasures is what made Tutankhamon famous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojejuhu rire he'õngue renda oĩhagueichaite** (Found as if it were newly made): This is too specific. While the treasures *looked* newly made, the main point is that *many* were found.
* **B: Oĩ rupi opa Rey rysýi-pe** (Was in all kings' riches): The text doesn't say that his riches were in *all* kings' riches. It focuses on the treasures found *with* him.
* **D: Oñemomba'eguasu rupi chupi Egipcio época-pe** (Increased fame in the Egyptian era): While it did increase his fame, the text doesn't directly say it increased fame *in the Egyptian era*. It states it greatly increased his fame *because* of the treasures found.



"
Mba'e raka'e ñe'ẽpapahára griego Homero ndikatúi ojapo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ñe'ẽ** (Language).

The text states: ""Umiva apytépe ojekuaavéva ikatu hína Homero, ñe’ẽpapahára griego, ohaiva’ekue jehaipyporãmby mba’eguasuetéva: Ñe’ẽpoty Ilíada ha Odisea.""

This translates to: ""Among them is Homer, a Greek poet, known for his masterful work: the poems Iliad and Odyssey.""  The key phrase is ""ñe’ẽpapahára griego,"" which means ""Greek poet"" or ""Greek **language** expert."" While he wrote *in* the Greek language, the question asks what he *created* - and he created works *in* the Greek language.

The other options are not as accurate:

*   **A: Ñehendu** (To see) - Incorrect context.
*   **B: Jehecha** (To observe) - Incorrect context.
*   **C: Jeguata** (To learn) - While he likely learned to write, the main point is his skill *with* the language.



"

This translates to: ""Among them is Homer, a Greek writer, who is known for his masterpieces: the poems Iliad and Odyssey.""

The other options are mentioned as important Greek figures, but Homero is specifically highlighted as a writer known for his masterpieces.
"
Moo raka'e oiko katuete umi familia hebreo-kuérava?,"The correct answer is **A: Okaháre** (When they settled).

The sentence ""Medio Oriente ára pytu hakukuépe, ogakuéra ndojehecharamõi."" translates to ""In the time of the Middle East's drought, they were not satisfied."" The following sentence says ""Umi familia hebreo-kuéra hetave jey oiko hikuái hekove’aja okaháre."" which translates to ""Many Hebrew families had to move when they settled.""

Therefore, the question asks *when* the Hebrew families had to move, and the answer is ""when they settled"" or ""okaháre.""
"
Mba'e ndohecharamõi umi familia hebreo-kuérava?,"The correct answer is **A: Ára pytu**.

The question asks what makes the Hebrew families uncomfortable. The first sentence states: ""Medio Oriente ára pytu hakukuépe, ogakuéra ndojehecharamõi.""  This translates to ""Because of the Middle East's climate, they are uncomfortable.""

Therefore, the answer is ""Ára pytu"" (climate).
"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytégui noñemombe’úi ojoavyha umi tetã escandinavo apytépe?,"The correct answer is **A: Rembiasa (Geography)**.

The text states: ""rey, hekokatu ha Dinamarca, Suecia, Noruega ha Islandia rembiasa.""  This translates to ""king, land and Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland are related (or have a connection)"".  The word ""rembiasa"" refers to geographical and historical ties, indicating they are geographically close and share a history.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yvy (Earth/Land):** While related to geography, it's too general.  ""Rembiasa"" is more specific to the historical and geographical connection between these nations.
* **C: Hekokatu (Money):**  The text doesn't mention money or economic factors.
* **D: Avakuéra (People):** While people are involved, the text focuses on the geographical and historical connection, not just the people.



"

The text states: ""Hakatu oñemboykévo ijejuhu, umi tribu esquimal oikomava’ekuevoi upépe upéramo guare."" This translates to ""However, when they were discovered, the Inuit tribes were already living there.""

Therefore, the Inuit tribes were the ones inhabiting Greenland when Erik the Red arrived.
"
Mávapa okarupyharéne apyka'ỹme?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuimba'e Roma-pegua iviru hetáva** (Men of Rome who hunted).

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
Mba'épa ndaipoichéne ymaguare Roma-pegua tembi'ukuérape?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuimba'e iviru hetáva okaruva ojekohápe** (The birds that roam and peck at the ground).

The passage states: ""Avei iñambuéva ha’e imborihúva ha kuña okaru’aja oguapyhápe, **kuimba’ekuéra iviru hetáva oguerohory umi karu guasu ha okarujoa hikuái ojekohápe.**"" This translates to: ""They also nest in the ground and in the shade of the trees, **the birds that roam and peck at the ground, producing large eggs and easily hatching them.**""

The question asks what wasn't present in Roman agriculture. Option C directly refers to the birds that were part of the Roman agricultural landscape, implying they were *present*, not absent. The passage then goes on to list crops and animals *not* found in Europe before the Americas and Asia.

Therefore, the question is a bit tricky, worded to make you think about what *wasn't* present, but the best answer based on the text is C because the passage describes these birds as part of the Roman environment. The question is essentially asking what the passage *describes* as being in the Roman environment, and then implying that these things weren't found in other parts of the world before the described period.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ndorekoichene impacto guasu?","The correct answer is **C: Tavusu-estado (City-state)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Umi tavusu-estado ha’e omoheñóiva tetãnguéra."" which translates to ""City-states are what unite nations.""  This indicates city-states were a fundamental element and had a significant impact on the development of civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Peteĩ tekoha (A country/territory):** While a country can *be part* of a civilization, it's not the core element the text emphasizes as having the *most* impact.
*   **B: Peteĩ cultura imichĩva (A small culture):**  A small culture isn't a defining feature of a civilization. Civilizations are characterized by complex, widespread cultures.
*   **D: Arandupy civilización-pegua (A non-civilized nation):** This describes what a civilization *isn't*, not a key element *within* a civilization.  The text emphasizes *what* makes a civilization significant, not the absence of it.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e omoheñói peteĩ tetãme?","The correct answer is **B: Peteĩ arandupy hekoteéva**.

Here's why:

* The text defines a civilization as a highly developed society with a population living in cities and possessing a state.
* It then states that a civilization is a society that develops over many generations, with a highly structured and complex culture.
* The question asks what *forms* a nation.  The text implies that a civilization is what *forms* a nation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Arandupy civilización-pegua (In a pre-civilized country):** This is the opposite of what the question is asking.
* **C: Tavusu-estado (City-state):** City-states are *part of* a civilization, but they don't *form* the entire nation.
* **D: Cultura-kuéra imichĩva (Combined cultures):** While a developed culture is *a part of* a civilization, the text isn't directly implying that *combined* cultures are what form a nation. It's the *developed* and structured culture within a civilization.



"
Mba'e nda'añetéi Drukgual Dzong rehe?,"The correct answer is **B: Oĩ Bután-pe**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Drukgyal Dzong ningo peteĩ fortaleza tapere ha peteĩ monasterio budista oĩva yvate Paro distrito-pe (Phondey Village-pe)."" which translates to ""Drukgyal Dzong is a fortress and a Buddhist monastery located in the Paro district (Phondey Village).""

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer, although they are true statements from the text:

* **A: Oñemoñepyrũ omomorã hag̃ua tibetano-mongoles osẽre tenonde ñorãirõhárape:** This is *part* of what Drukgyal Dzong was built to do, but not the most fundamental defining characteristic.
* **C: Tata guasu rupive opyta sa’imíntema Drukgyal Dzong reliquia:** This describes a specific event that happened *later* in the Dzong's history, not what defines it generally.
* **D: Omoñepyrũ Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:**  While Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel *did* build Drukgyal Dzong, this doesn't define what Drukgyal Dzong *is*.


Therefore, the most general and accurate answer is that Drukgyal Dzong **oĩ Bután-pe** (is located in Bhutan).



"
Mávapa omombe'u porã ko apytépe oiko akue tata guasu rire Drukgyal Dzong-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Oikóvo chugui peteĩva umi mba’e ojehechasevéva**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tata guasu rire, oñeñangareko pe fortaleza rehe, oikóvo chugui peteĩva umi mba’e ojehechasevéva Bután-pe."" This translates to ""With the King, he rebuilt the fortress, containing one of the most precious things in Bhutan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Reliquia opytáva ha'e Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal ta’ãnga añoite:** While the reliquary is important, the text doesn't state that it contains the King's body.
* **B: Umi tibetano-mongoles osẽ tenonde ñorairõhápe:** This describes the initial reason for building the fortress, not what the King did later.
* **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel oñangareko hese:**  The text says the King rebuilt the fortress, not Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.

Mávapa ko'ã mombe'u apytépe ha'e añete Camboya rehe?,"The correct answer is **C: Vietnam-gua oike Camboya yvýpe oikévo siglo XVIII** (Vietnam-people entered Cambodia during the 18th century).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Umi arypaha siglo XVIII ryepýpe, Vietnan-gua avei oike Camboya yvýpe."" (During the latter half of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also entered Cambodian territory.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vietnam-gua ohundiete Phnom Phen** (Vietnam-people conquered Phnom Penh) - While Vietnam did eventually conquer Phnom Penh, the text doesn't specify this happening in the 18th century. It just states they entered Cambodian territory.
* **B: Camboya oike Tailandia yvýpe 1772-pe** (Cambodia entered Thai territory in 1772) - The text says Thailand entered Cambodia in 1772, *not* the other way around.
* **D: Tailandia-gua ohundiete Phnom Phen** (Thai-people conquered Phnom Penh) - The text states Thailand entered Cambodia, not conquered Phnom Penh.

Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the provided text."
Mávapa ko'ãva apytépe omombe'u añetéva Camboya yvýpe jeike?,"The correct answer is **D: Tailandi-gua oike Camboya yvýpe heta jey**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tailandi-gua oike Camboya yvýpe heta jey siglo XVIII aja..."" which translates to ""The Thai people entered Cambodia frequently in the 18th century...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vietnam-gua oike Camboya yvýpe heta jey:** While Vietnam did enter Cambodia, the passage explicitly states that the Thai presence was more frequent in the 18th century.
* **B: Tailandi-gua oike Camboya yvýpe 1772-pe:** This is only one specific point in time and doesn't represent the overall frequency of Thai incursions.
* **C: Vietnam-gua ohundiete Phnom Phen:** This is also a specific event and doesn't encompass the broader pattern of Vietnamese presence in Cambodia.

The other options are incorrect:

Mba'éichapa ojehechakuaa nivel pH-gua?,"The correct answer is **C: Mboy ion hidrógeno-gua oguereko upe sustancia química** (How many hydrogen ions does the substance have).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""pH nivel ojehechakuaa mboy ion de hidrógeno-pa oguereko rupi upe (H+)"" which translates to ""The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions it has (H+).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mba’éichaitépa oguereko ácido térã básico upe químico** (How acidic or basic the substance is): While acidity and basicity *relate* to the number of hydrogen ions, the *direct* measurement of pH is based on the *concentration* of hydrogen ions.
* **B: Mba’éichaitépa oguereko protón-kuéra upe químico-pe** (How many protons does the substance have):  The passage mentions protons, but the pH is specifically about *hydrogen ions* (which are protons *without* their electrons).
* **D: Mba’éichaitépa oguereko electrón-kuéra upe químico** (How many electrons does the substance have): Electrons are not directly related to the pH level.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hidrógeno ion-kuéra ha’e hína umi protón-kuéra ojepe’ava’ekue chuguikuéra electrón oguerekóva..."" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost an electron...""  Therefore, hydrogen ions are protons.

The question asks what *doesn't* describe a lion pride. The other options *do* describe aspects of lion prides mentioned in the text. Therefore, the statement that they hunt like a pack is the exception.

The passage explicitly states: ""León-kuéra ha’e mbarakaja oikokuaavéva ojoapytépe ha oiko atyguasúpe hérava manada."" (Lions are animals that live in groups and form social units called prides.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Oiko ku aguara atýicha (They live like a family):** While lions live in groups that function somewhat like families, the passage doesn't specifically say they live ""like a family."" It focuses on them living in prides.
*   **C: Macho ha hembra pya’e ojukakuaa hapichápe (Males and females quickly mate):** The passage mentions mating, but not the speed of the process.
*   **D: Heko ojogua ambue mbarakajakuérape (They hunt with other animals):** The passage clarifies that lions *only* hunt with their pride and not with other species. It is not a general characteristic of their behavior.

Therefore, the most accurate statement *not* mentioned in the passage is that lions live in groups.



"
Tapiti mávape g̃uarã presa jepigua?,"The correct answer is **A: Mbarakaja imichĩva (Smaller predators)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ipahaitépe, oĩ heta mbarakaja michĩva (umíva apytépe ogapegua mbarakajakuéra isãsóva) ho’úva mba’e michĩvéva, taha’e bicho, anguja, ambere ha guyra’i."" This translates to: ""When it hunts, there are many smaller predators (including those that are not part of the big cats) that hunt smaller animals, such as rodents, shrews, lizards, and snakes.""

Therefore, smaller predators are the ones that prey on the tapir.  The tapir is a large animal and would be preyed upon by smaller animals."
Mba'épa ho'u umi mbarakaja michĩvéva?,"The correct answer is **A: Anguja (Hedgehog)**.

The text states: ""Ipahaitépe, oĩ heta mbarakaja michĩva (umíva apytépe ogapegua mbarakajakuéra isãsóva) ho’úva mba’e michĩvéva, taha’e bicho, **anguja**, ambere ha guyra’i.""

This translates to: ""When it's scared, there are many smaller animals (among them animals that are not considered small animals) that do small things, such as creatures, **hedgehogs**, ants, snakes, and birds.""



"
Mávapa ko’ãvagui ndaha'éi peteĩ mba’e ojapóva jaguarete'i ojapyvy jave?,"The correct answer is **A: Okañy hekoháre**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that jaguars *often* take their prey to a secluded spot *before* eating.  It then lists other behaviors like hunting deer, monkeys, and birds, having excellent night vision, and being able to climb trees.
* The question asks what is *not* something a jaguar *does* when it hunts.
* While jaguars *do* eat their prey in a secluded spot, the passage presents this as something they do *before* eating, not as a part of the *hunting* process itself. The other options (hunting deer, taking prey to hide, climbing trees) are presented as behaviors associated with hunting.
* The passage mentions that ocelots *hide* their prey before eating. While jaguars might do this too, the passage doesn't explicitly say it's a characteristic of their hunting *process*.

Therefore, ""Okañy hekoháre"" (taking prey to a secluded spot) is the action that's *not* directly linked to the act of hunting itself as described in the passage.
"
Mávapa ko'ãva mombe'u apytépe ndaha'éi hína añete jaguarete'i rehegui? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ojapyvykuaa pyharekue (They hunt by sight)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ikatu ohecha porãiterei pytũmby hápe visión pyharegua rupive..."" which translates to ""They see very well at night through their night vision."" 

Option A directly reflects this information. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Oiko mbegue katuete (They are very agile):** While jaguars *are* agile, the passage doesn't focus on this aspect.
*   **C: Ndohetü poräi hikuái (They don't hunt well):** The passage describes them as effective hunters.
*   **D: Ojapyvyseve mymba michĩeteveve ichugui (They hunt smaller animals):** The passage mentions they hunt a variety of animals, but doesn't specifically say they *only* hunt smaller ones.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that they hunt using their excellent night vision."
Mávapa ko'ãvagui ndaha'éi jaguarete ojapokuaavéva?,"The correct answer is **B: Ojupi yvate**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is *not* a characteristic of a jaguar. The passage states:

*  ""Peteĩ atleta ha’evéva, jaguareté ikatu ojupi yvate (sa’imirõ jepe)..."" -  This tells us the athlete jumps high.
*  ""Jaguarete ñekorõrõ ndaha’éi león korõrõichagua, ha’éte ku ñe’ẽrysýi oguerekóva ñe’ẽ vai ha osapukáiva."" - This highlights that jaguars roar differently than lions (with more speech-like sounds) and can purr.

The other options are things jaguars *do*:

* **A: Ñekorõrõ (Roar):** The passage mentions a unique roar.
* **C: Opo puku (Scratch):** This is implied by the act of attacking and biting.
* **D: Oitira (Pounce):** The phrase ""ojupi yvate"" (jumps high) strongly suggests a pouncing motion.

Therefore, **ojupi yvate (jumps high)** is the action that *isn't* necessarily exclusive to a jaguar, although it is a characteristic of the athlete described. It's the most neutral option regarding jaguar behavior.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épe ndojojái jaguarete ha león?","The correct answer is **B: Ñekorõrõme (In hunting)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jaguarete ñekorõrõ ndaha’éi león korõrõichagua, ha’éte ku ñe’ẽrysýi oguerekóva ñe’ẽ vai ha osapukáiva."" This translates to: ""Jaguar hunting is not like lion hunting; rather, it is characterized by stealth and ambush.""

Therefore, the difference is in their hunting methods.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ojapo Robert Hooke ambue biólogo mboyve?","The correct answer is **A: Ohechava’ekue célula-kuéra omanóva** (He observed the cells within the cork).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Robert Hooke, peteĩ biólogo Inglaterra-gua, ohecha cuadro michĩ’iva corcho-pe peteĩ microscopio rupive. Ojogua kotýpe. Ha’eraẽvete tapicha ohecha va’ekue célula-kuéra omanóva.""  This translates to: ""Robert Hooke, an English biologist, observed small squares in cork with a microscope. He called them cells. And so, the term cells were born.""

Therefore, the key takeaway is that Hooke *observed cells*.  While he didn't identify them as the fundamental building blocks of life (that came later), he did see and describe them.  Option A directly reflects what the passage states he observed.
"
"""Mba'e he'ise """"célula""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Koty imichĩva (Small room)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Cell ou latí ñe’ẽgui he’iséva koty michĩva."" which translates to ""Cell in Latin means small room.""
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa ojapokuaa opa mymba?","The correct answer is **B: Omỹi** (They reproduce).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mymbakuéra ikatu omỹi."" This directly translates to ""Jellyfish can reproduce.""

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Oveve** (They swim) - The text mentions they swim but doesn't say that's *what all jellyfish do*.
*   **C: Oyta** (They eat) - The text mentions they eat, but again, doesn't say this is what all jellyfish *do*.
*   **D: Ojo'o** (They hunt) - The text mentions they hunt, but again, doesn't say this is what all jellyfish *do*.

Therefore, the only action explicitly stated as something jellyfish do is reproduction.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa ndaha’éi opaite mymba orekóva?","The correct answer is **C: Cerebro**.

The text states: ""Mymbakuéra añónte oguereko cerebro (hakatu ndaha’éi opaite mymba; medusa, ndoguerekói cerebro).""  This translates to: ""Jellyfish possess a brain (although not all animals have one; jellyfish do not have one).""

Therefore, the text explicitly says that not all animals have a brain.
"
Mba'e oipytyvõ yvyramatakuérape fotosíntesis jave?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuarahy'ã (Sunlight)**.

The text states that plants use sunlight to produce food through photosynthesis.
"
Mba'e ojapo avakuéra upéi yvyramáta oipytéva?,"The correct answer is **A: Tembi'u (Food)**.

The passage states: ""Yvyramata kuéra ojuhu alimento kuarahýpe fotosíntesis rupive."" This translates to ""Plants get food through sunlight via photosynthesis.""  Photosynthesis produces sugars, which are a type of food for the plant.

Therefore, the answer is **tembi'u (food)**.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã techaukaha apytépe oñemoĩne evolución renondépe?","The correct answer is **B: Aty’i oñemomombyry atyguasu oĩhagui** (The species multiplies by creating groups).

Here's why:

The text describes how a species multiplies and colonizes new habitats. This multiplication (""oñemomombyry atyguasu oĩhagui"") is a key driver of evolution because it leads to the species adapting to different environments.  The other options are steps *within* that process, but not the fundamental driver of evolution itself.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aty'i oho ambue tendápe ha ndoikokuaái hekoha pyahúpe** (The species moves to other places and doesn't settle in a new habitat): This is the opposite of what the text describes.
*   **C: Aty pyahu oñepyrũvo oikokuaáma hekoha pyahúpe** (When the species first arrives, it settles in a new habitat): This describes the *initial colonization* but not the broader evolutionary process.
*   **D: Aty ñemomombyry ojoehegui** (The species multiplies by extinction): This is incorrect because multiplication and extinction are opposite processes. The text highlights multiplication leading to diversification.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva mombe'u apytépe ndomombe'úi proceso de especiación? ,"The correct answer is **C: He’iséva hína especie pyahu ñepyrũ**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ko proceso-pe rohenói especiación, he’iséva hína especie pyahu ñepyrũ."" (This process creates speciation, which is the birth of a new species).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oiko aty pyahu ndoikokuaáiramo hekoha pyahúpe** (A new species is not formed when a population settles on an island) - This is incorrect because the text says a new species *is* formed when they settle on an island.
*   **B: Mba’eguasueterei evolución-pe g̃uarã** (It greatly contributes to evolution) - While speciation *does* contribute to evolution, the text's focus here is on *what* speciation *is*, not its broader impact on evolution. It's not the core definition being presented.
*   **D: Ndaikatúi ojehapejoko** (It cannot be reversed) - The text doesn't mention the reversibility of speciation. While often irreversible, it isn't the primary point being made.



"
Mávapa ha'e retepy jeikoparãverã ombohapéva tuguy korasõme?,"The correct answer is **A: Arteria**.

The passage states: ""Tuguy osẽ korasõgui peteĩ tuguy rapére hérava **arteria** ha ohojey korasõ me ambue ruguy rape hérava vena-kuéra rupive."" which translates to ""A vessel leaves the heart and becomes an **artery**, carrying blood from the heart to other parts of the body through other vessels called veins.""

Therefore, arteries are the vessels that carry blood away from the heart.
"
Mávapa ha'e tuguy rape michĩvéva?,"The correct answer is **A: Capilares**.

The text states: ""Umi tuguy rape michĩvéva hérava capilares."" which translates to ""These small vessels are called capillaries.""
"
Mba'épe ombokatupyry mymbachu'ipe ikatu haguére omoĩ ipepo ikupegotyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Okañy hag̃ua tenda**.

The text states: ""Kóva rupi ikatu ombokatupyryve ichupe okañy hag̃ua umi tenda michĩvévape umi depredador-kuéragui.""  This translates to: ""Therefore, I am able to defend myself by fleeing to small dens from predators.""

The sentence is explaining *why* the anteater spits.  It spits as a defense mechanism *to flee to a den*. The other options aren't directly linked to the reason the anteater spits in the given context.



"
Mba'e ko'ã apytépe ndoje'éi mymbachu'i oveve haguére?,"The correct answer is **D: Hekopete (Because of being fragile)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that *peve mymbachu'i ndaikatúiva oipepy ipepo ha'e ñahatĩ ha efímera-kuéra* which translates to ""Because the fragile insects are prey to spiders and ephemeral creatures."" This directly implies that fragility is a reason why some insects are not spiders.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ijykererã jetopa (Because of being small):** The text mentions that some small insects are prey, so being small doesn't exclude them from being insects.
* **B: Mboypa oiko (Where they are located):** The text doesn't discuss location as a defining characteristic.
* **C: Tembi'u jeheka (Extreme drought):** The text doesn't mention drought.



"
Mba'e ko'ã apytépe ndaha'éi dinosaurio-kuéra rehegua?,"The correct answer is **B: Plumaje**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that many birds are believed to have evolved from dinosaurs *and* possess plumage. 
* The passage describes dinosaurs having scales and claws. 
* Birds *have* plumage (feathers). 

Therefore, plumage is the characteristic that distinguishes birds (and therefore, *isn't* a characteristic solely of dinosaurs, as the passage implies). The other options (claws, scales, and teeth) are all characteristics specifically mentioned as being found in dinosaurs.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva mba’e apytépe ndaha'éi guyra ha dinosauro-kuéra ojojaha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ovevekuaa**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what is *not* a characteristic shared by birds and dinosaurs.
* The text states that birds have plumaje (feathers).
* The text also describes dinosaurs as having escama (scales) and garra (claws).
* Birds evolved *from* dinosaurs, and feathers are a key characteristic that links them.

Therefore, feathers are the characteristic that birds and dinosaurs *don't* share in the way the other options do.  Dinosaurs had scales and claws. Birds can claw and have feathers. T-Rex had scales, claws, and could bite powerfully.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e cícada yvyramáta parte-pa ikatu Triceraptop ho'u?","The correct answer is **A: Hogue haimbéva (Flower and stem)**.

The text states: ""Ko yvyramáta ha’ete peteĩ palmera michĩva oguerekóva hogue akua ha haimbéva.""  This translates to ""This plant is a small palm tree with a flower and stem."" Therefore, the Triceratops eats the flower and stem of the cicada plant.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva mba’e apytépe ikatu ha'e Triceraptop rembi'u? ","The correct answer is **D: Yvyra orekova yva ivenenosova** (Plants that produce venom).

Here's why:

* The passage discusses the theory that Triceratops might have eaten cícadas (a type of plant) that produced venom. 
* It also mentions that some scientists believe plants could have been venomous.
* The question asks what could have been the food source for Triceratops according to the passage. 
* Option D directly reflects this theory of Triceratops consuming plants with venom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Perezoso (Sloth):** Sloths are not relevant to the passage's discussion of Triceratops' diet.
* **B: Yvyra rakã hatãva (Plant with thorns):** The passage mentions plants with thorns, but the main focus is on venomous plants.
* **C: Gua'ái (Animals):**  The question asks about the *food source* for Triceratops, not about other animals.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva deporte apytépe oiméne ojeguerohoryeterei umi región oĩva Italia norte gotyope?","The correct answer is **C: Snowboarding**.

Here's why:

The text mentions that Italian athletes excel in various sports and that they are particularly successful in sports practiced in the northern regions of Italy. **Snowboarding** is a sport strongly associated with the mountainous regions of Northern Italy. 

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Vakapipopo (Volleyball)** - While Italy is good at volleyball, it's not specifically tied to Northern Italy.
*   **B: Voleibol (Volleyball)** - Same reasoning as above.
*   **D: Carreras de F1 (F1 Racing)** - F1 racing is a global sport and not specific to any region within Italy. While Ferrari is based in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy, F1 isn't as broadly associated with Northern Italy as snowboarding.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva deporte-pe pa Italia osẽ campeón mundial raka'e?","The correct answer is **A: Vakapipopo (Football/Soccer)**.

The text explicitly states: ""...osẽ campeón Mundial 2006-pe"" which translates to ""...won the 2006 World Cup"".  Italy won the 2006 FIFA World Cup in football (soccer).
"

The text states: ""Belgica yvy pehẽ kko’agãgua ymave Luxemburgo yvy va’ekue, katu ohasa Bélgica poguýpe Revolución belga 1830 rire."" This translates to: ""Belgium's territory surpasses Luxembourg's territory, but it passed through Belgium during the Belgian Revolution of 1830.""

Therefore, the reason Luxembourg's territory passed through Belgium is the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
"
Mba'e ojehu Luxemburgo oñemombyte haguére?,"The correct answer is **A: Oike Alemania poguype** (It became part of Germany).

The text states: ""Luxemburgo akói oñeha’ã oiko hag̃ua tetã oñemombytéva apañuãime ramo, katu Ñorãirõ Guasu Peteĩ ha Mokõihápe oike Alemania poguýpe."" This translates to: ""Luxembourg was intended to be a neutral state, but after the Great Revolution, it came under the German Empire.""
"

The text states: ""Turquía retepy, taha’e yno’õ, oipuru 783,562 kilómetros cuadrados (300,948 millas cuadradas),upévagui 755,688 kilómetros cuadrados (291,773 millas cuadradas) ojejuhu Asia suroeste gotyo ha **23,764 kilómetros cuadrados (9,174 millas cuadradas) oĩ Europa-pe**.""

This translates to: ""Turkey's territory, partly in Europe, covers 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) are located in southwestern Asia and **23,764 square kilometers (9,174 square miles) are in Europe**.""
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mboy milla rupi ipuku Turquía?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Turquía yvy oguereko hetave 1.600 kilómetros (1.000 millas) ipukukue..."" which translates to ""Turkey has a coastline of 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles)..."".  The question asks for the coastline in miles, and the text provides 1600 miles.
"
Mba'erã ojeporu ñe'ẽ latín Ciudad del Vaticano-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ñandejara ñe’ẽ oñehendu hag̃ua** (God's language to be understood).

The passage states: ""hakatu latín ojeporuve Ñandejara ñe’ẽ oñehendu hag̃ua."" which translates to ""Latin is used to explain God's language to be understood.""
"
"Ciudad del Vaticano-pe, mba'erã ojeporu italiano?","The correct answer is **A: Ñe’ẽ léikuéra ñemboguapyrã (Official language)**.

The text states: ""Ciudad del Vaticano oipuru italiano ñe’ẽ léikuéra ñemboguapyrã ha Tetã momarandurã."" This translates to ""The Vatican City uses Italian as its official language and is an independent state.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tetã momarandurã (Independent state)** - While true, this isn't *what* Italian is used *for* in the Vatican.
* **C: Ñandejara ñe’ẽ oñehendu hag̃ua (God's language to be understood)** - This refers to Latin, which is mentioned later in the text as the language used to understand God.
* **D: Ñe'ẽ ojeporuvéva (Language used)** - This is too general.  The text specifies *how* Italian is used – as the official language.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytepe onohe beneficio oñembojehe’a haguére computadora-pe pukuéra oĩva?","The correct answer is **A: Purahéi (Music)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Purahéi katuínte oñembohasajey computadora-kuéra ha’evéva rupive ojejapo ha ojehe’a hag̃ua pukuéra oĩva.""  This translates to: ""Beautiful music is created and played through computers and the files that exist within them.""

The question asks what benefit the files within a computer provide, and the text specifically mentions music as a benefit.  The other options are related to processing power (ta'ãnga), speed (ta'ãngamýi), and animation (animación), but the text directly links *music* to the benefit derived from the files.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, moõgua óga oreko inodoro ojehykuavokuaáva?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The text explicitly states that Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had sophisticated plumbing, including flush toilets and sewage systems, predating similar systems found in other civilizations mentioned (Minoan Crete, Santorini, Egypt, Persia, China, and Rome).  Therefore, Mohenjo-daro is the civilization directly linked to the described advanced toilet system.
"
Moõ ojetopa ra'e alcantarillado?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The text explicitly states that Harappa (and Mohenjo-daro) had a sophisticated drainage system with toilets connected to it, which is comparable to systems found in Minoan Crete and Santorini, Greece. The other options are mentioned as having bathrooms but not necessarily comparable drainage systems with connected toilets.
"
Mba'e oiko patinador ojere hag̃ua akatúa gotyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Cuchilla yvypegua ikarẽ rupi michĩmĩ (The blade is smaller)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Upe cuchilla yvypegua ikarẽ rupi michĩmĩ, upe cuchilla ikarẽ’imívo peteĩ térã ambue tenda gotyo, upe hembe’y ojáva yrypyy’áre ikarẽ’imi avei."" This translates to: ""The blade is smaller, and when the blade is replaced with one from another store, the jump performed on the ramp also gets higher.""

The text then connects this smaller blade to the skater's ability to jump. It implies that a smaller blade allows for greater height and therefore helps the skater to land more easily.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mokõive hembe’y cuchilla ykere (Multiple jumps with the blade):** The text focuses on *one* jump and how it's affected by the blade.
* **C: Patinador talento rupi (Due to the skater's talent):** While talent is important, the text directly links the blade size to the success of the jump.
* **D: Yrypy'a calidad (Skate quality):** The text specifically mentions the *blade* quality, not the entire skate.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytepe omombe'u porã patín ko'ãgaguáva mba'ére oreko peteĩ ikuaha?","The correct answer is **C: Ojoapytépe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Upéicha rupi mokõive hembe’y ojaporãve yrypy’a rehe, jepéramo oĩ karẽ."" This translates to ""In this way, both skaters can perform the spin, but there is a crack (or gap).""  Then it goes on to explain that the crack is caused by the ice being worn down (""Upe cuchilla yvypegua ikarẽ rupi michĩmĩ..."").

Therefore, the reason the ice skater has a gap (ikuaha) is because the ice is **oñoapytépe** (worn down/wearing away).



* **A: Mokõi hembe'y (Both skaters)** - While both skaters are involved in the process, it doesn't explain *why* the gap exists.
* **B: Ikarë (Crack)** - This is the result, not the cause.
* **D: Ikarẽ'imi (Wearing away/being worn)** - This describes the *process* that creates the gap, but ""oñoapytépe"" is a more direct translation of what's happening to the ice. ""Ikarẽ'imi"" fits the context better than just ""Ikarẽ.""

This translates to: ""Scientists discovered in this process ""emission radiation"" when atoms are excited by light, and they emit a light particle called a photon..."" 
* Therefore, the process of emitting energy extra from light involves **emission radiation**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Radiación-gui (From Radiation):** While radiation is involved, it's the *emission* of radiation that's the key process.
* **B: Fotón ñeme'ẽ-gui (From Photon Emission):** Photon emission is a *result* of the radiation, not the process that causes the atom to release extra energy.
* **C: Fotón-gui (From Photon):** Photons are *emitted* as a result of the process, not the source of the energy release.



"
Mba'ére peteĩ átomo ome'ẽ peteĩ fotón?,"The correct answer is **C: Nivel de energía inestable (Unstable energy level)**.

Here's why:

The text describes atoms emitting photons when they lose energy.  This loss of energy often happens when an atom is in an unstable energy state.  To become more stable, the atom releases the excess energy in the form of a photon.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Oñeguenohẽ energía extra (Gaining extra energy):** The text indicates *losing* energy to emit a photon, not gaining it.
* **B: Oñemomỹi rupi luz mimbi rupive (Being illuminated by light):**  While light *can* excite atoms, the text describes the atom *emitting* a photon, not being illuminated to do so.
* **D: Reacción adversa radiación-gui (Adverse reaction to radiation):** The text doesn't describe photon emission as an adverse reaction. It's a natural process to achieve a more stable energy state.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'ére foco ndoikovéitama?","The correct answer is **C: Foco-pe oĩva filamento okái**.

Here's why:

The text explains that a light bulb works by passing electricity through a filament. The filament heats up and emits light. If the filament breaks (okái), the electricity can't pass through, and the bulb won't light up.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndojeporu porãi rupi foco rehegua llave (The switch isn't turned on properly):** While a switch needs to be on for the bulb to light, the text specifically discusses *why* a bulb might not light *even when the switch is on*. The filament being broken is the core reason.
* **B: Ndoikepái rupi foco base metálica casquillo-pe (The bulb isn't making contact with the metal base in the socket):**  If the bulb isn't making contact, there would likely be a short circuit or no connection. The text isn't describing that scenario.
* **D: Electricidad oĩva casquillo-pe sa'i (Electricity isn't present in the socket):** If there's no electricity, the bulb won't light. However, the question is asking *why* the bulb might not light *when electricity *is* present (implied by the text's description of how it works).

Therefore, the damaged filament (okái) is the direct reason the bulb won't light.
"
Mba'ereheve epokóramo ehasa peligro emoambue jave foco?,"The correct answer is **A: Filamento (Filament)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how a light bulb works: electricity passes through a metal filament inside the bulb. The filament heats up and glows, producing light.  The text specifically mentions that the filament is what creates the arc and the heat. The potential danger is that the filament gets extremely hot.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Llave foco rehegua (Light switch):** The switch controls the flow of electricity, but it isn't the source of the danger.
* **C: Foco base (Bulb base):** The base connects the bulb to the socket and isn't inherently dangerous.
* **D: Cable (Cable):** The cable carries electricity, but the danger lies within the bulb itself.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oiko núcleo ojemboja'oramo?","The correct answer is **B: Opoi energía**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Oñemboja’o pyahu jey pe núcleo opoi’imi upe energía."" This translates to ""The nucleus releases a lot of energy when it is split.""  Therefore, the core function of a nucleus releasing energy is the release of energy itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oĩve protón-kuéra (It has protons):**  The passage mentions protons and neutrons as components of the nucleus, but it doesn't say that *having* protons causes energy release.
*   **C: Átomo-kuéra ndopytái (Atoms are unstable):** While unstable atoms can undergo fission, instability itself doesn't directly cause the energy release.
*   **D: Okañy neutrón-kuéra (Releases neutrons):**  Fission *often* releases neutrons, but the release of energy is the primary outcome. The passage focuses on the energy release aspect.



"
Máva ohechauka porã jehenói mombyry guive?,"The correct answer is **A: Telescopio**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tembikuaaharakuéra oipuru telescopio arapýre yvy’apu’apegua atmósfera omoambue upe ñande luz ha jehecha."" This translates to: ""Scientists use telescopes from space to observe the Earth's atmosphere and analyze our light.""

Therefore, the telescopes are the instruments used to observe the light and understand the phenomenon. The other options are involved in the process (satellites are launched by rockets, light is what's being observed, and rockets launch the satellites), but the telescopes are the tools for *seeing* the phenomenon.
"
"Ko’ãvagui, mávapa ojeporu oñemoĩ hag̃ua telescopio arapýre?","The correct answer is **B: Cohete-kuéra (Rockets)**.

The text states: ""Satélite ojegueraha kuri arapýre peteĩ cohete rupive."" This translates to ""The satellite was launched from space by a rocket."" Therefore, rockets were used to deploy the telescope.
"
Mba'e ojeikuaava'erã evento cíclico-rehe ehapykueho hag̃ua tiempo ohasávo?,"The correct answer is **B: Jehecha jey jeývo (Being seen again)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tiempo avei ha’e mba’éichapa ñambojoajuse umi oikóva pukukue (ipukukue). **Ndetevoi ikatu ehapykueho tiempo ohasávo, ehechakuévo upe oikóva jehecha jey jeývo.**"" which translates to: ""Time is also how it brings back what was (cyclical). **Once time passes, it is seen again.**""

Therefore, the cyclical nature of an event, as described in the text, is defined by being seen again after a period of time.  The other options are not directly related to the cyclical definition in the text.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'éreheve oñembojoaju tiempo?","The correct answer is **B: Jehecha jey jeývo (By seeing it anew)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tiempo avei ha’e mba’éichapa ñambojoajuse umi oikóva pukukue (ipukukue). **Evento cíclico ha’e hína mba’e oiko jey jey katuíva.**"" This translates to: ""Time is also how we experience the cyclical things (cyclical events). **A cyclical event is something that happens again and again.**""

The key phrase is ""ñambojoajuse umi oikóva pukukue"" which means ""we experience things cyclically"". This implies that time is linked to the recurrence of events and our repeated observation of them. While the other options might be related to time, they aren't the core reason time is described this way in the passage.

*   **A: Pukukue (Cyclical):** This is a *result* of time, not the *reason* for it.
*   **C: Experiencia (Experience):** While experience is involved, the passage specifically highlights the *cyclical* nature of experience.
*   **D: Opamba'epe oĩ (From memory):** Memory is related to time, but the text isn't focusing on how time is preserved in memory. It's about how we perceive time through repeated observations.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba’épa ojapo katuete hína heredero trono-pegua?","The correct answer is **A: Ohupyty 2:2 jehechakuaa mokõihápegua**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hakatu Charles oho Trinity College Mbo’ehaovusúpe, Cambridge, upépe oñemoarandu Antropología ha Arqueología-pe **yperire Historia**, ohupytyhápe 2:2 (jehechakuaa mokõihápegua) Charles ha’e Kuri Familia Real Británica apytégui ohupytýva peteĩ título mbo’ehaovusúpe.""

This translates to: ""King Charles went to Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, **and History**, and inherited a title from the British Royal Family according to 2:2 (cross-reference).""

Option A directly refers to the text's mention of ""ohupyty 2:2 jehechakuaa mokõihápegua,"" meaning ""inherited according to 2:2 (cross-reference).""  While the text mentions other activities, the question asks *what does he do to become the heir to the throne?* and the answer is that he *inherits* the title. The ""2:2"" reference is the key to understanding the mechanism of his succession.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Oheja mbo’ehaovu oho hag̃ua ejército-pe** (He joins the army to get a title): The text doesn't say he joins the army to get a title.
*   **C: Oñemoarandu historia-pe** (He studies history):  While he *does* study history, it's not the reason he becomes heir.
*   **D: Oho mbo’ehaovusu ha upéi ejército-pe** (He gets a title and then goes to the army): The text doesn't say he gets a title *and then* goes to the army. He inherits the title directly.



"
"Ko maranduha he’iháicha, mba'epa akue ojapóva tenondete Charles?","The correct answer is **D: Oho Trinity College-pe** (He went to Trinity College).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Hakatu Charles oho Trinity College Mbo’ehaovusúpe, Cambridge..."" (Prince Charles went to Trinity College in Cambridge...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oike ejército-pe omohu’ã mboyve mbo'ehao** (He joined the army and received a high rank) - The text says he *didn't* join the army *to* receive a high rank. It says he *is* the heir and will lead the army.
* **B: Oñemoarandu Antropología-pe** (He studied Anthropology) - The text says he studied Anthropology *and* Archaeology, but being *only* anthropology is not the complete picture.
* **C: Ohupyty jehechakuaa** (He graduated) - The text mentions he studied and is pursuing history, but it doesn't mention he has graduated.



"
Moõ tetã guare ha'e Trygvasson yga'aty?,"The correct answer is **D: Noruega-gui** (From Norway).

The text explicitly states: ""Olaf Trygvasson, **peteĩ Noruego oipotajeýva** hetã umi Danés poguýgi."" which translates to ""Olaf Trygvasson, a **Norwegian who led** some Danish troops.""
"
Araka'e rupi Estonia oĩva’ekue Alemania arandupyeta poguýpe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ojapo 600 ary rupi (600 years)**.

The text states that Estonia was under German rule in the 15th century and that this period lasted for about 600 years.
"
Estonio ñe'ẽ oñemopyenda mba'éreheve?,"The correct answer is **A: Tai “Õ / õ” rehe** (Because of the ""Õ / õ"" sound).

The passage states: ""Oñemopyenda alemán achegety rehe ha oñemoĩ tai “Õ / õ”."" This translates to ""It was borrowed from the German language and the 'Õ / õ' was introduced."" The introduction of the ""Õ / õ"" sound is highlighted as a key factor in the borrowing of German words.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Alemán achegety (German priests):** While German priests played a role in introducing the language, the passage emphasizes the *sound* (""Õ / õ"") as the primary reason for the borrowing.
* **C: Monje alemán-kuéra (German monks):** Similar to option B, monks were involved but the specific sound is the more direct cause mentioned.
* **D: Ñandejára (God):** God is mentioned in the context of the monks' mission, but not as a reason for the linguistic borrowing.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, hindi ñe’ẽharaitévavoi nativo iñambuekuaa mba'ére?","The correct answer is **A: Ojehecháramo umi dialecto ojoajuetereíva ojuehe** (Because the dialects are not standardized).

The text explicitly states: ""Ñe’ẽharaitévavoi iñambuekuaa ojehecháramo umi dialecto ojoajuetereíva ojuehe."" which translates to ""It is not possible to standardize the dialects because they are not standardized.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Urdu oñe'ẽva ojehecháramo** (Because Urdu speakers are speaking it): This is not the reason. The text is about the standardization of Hindi, not Urdu speakers.
* **C: Avakuéra ontendéva ko ñe'ẽ ojehecháramo** (Because people who understand this language are speaking it): This is irrelevant to the lack of standardization.
* **D: Avakuéra oleeva ko ñe'ẽ ojehecháramo** (Because people are not speaking this language): This is incorrect. The text clearly states that 800 million people speak Hindi.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ha’e peteĩ ñe’ẽ añetegua hindi ha urdu ñe’ẽ rehegua?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndojojoguái hikuái ñe’ẽavúpe** (They share some vocabulary).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hindi ha urdu ojojogua hikuái ñe’ẽavúpe hakatu ndaupéichai ijehaípe."" This translates to ""Hindi and Urdu share some vocabulary despite not being mutually intelligible.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñe'ẽva ko'ãva ndaikatúi ojokupytypa** (They do not share anything): This is incorrect because the text explicitly states they *do* share some vocabulary.
* **B: Ndojojoguái hikuái ijehaípe** (They share some grammar): The text says they are not mutually intelligible, implying their grammar is different.
* **C: Ojojogua ñe'ẽ ha jehaípe** (They share language and grammar):  While they share vocabulary, the text implies grammar is distinct.



Therefore, option D is the only one that accurately reflects the information provided in the text.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaha’eĩ hína peteĩ ñe’ẽ añetegua Hangeul achegety rehegua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ñepyrũraite oñehenói achegety Hunan Jeongeum**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ñepyrũraite oñehenói achegety Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum he’iséva “Tyapu oĩporãva avakuéra ñemoarandurã”"" which translates to ""Initially, the Hangeul alphabet called Hunmin Jeongeum was created, meaning 'The correct sound for the teaching of the people'.""
* Option B directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **A: Oñemoheñóiva Rey Sejong reinado ñepurũ jave (Initially created during King Sejong's reign):** While true, it's less specific than option B. Option B tells us *what* was created.
* **C: Joseon dinastía-gua irundyha rey omoheñóiva'ekue (The second king of the Joseon dynasty to create something):**  The text states Sejong was the *first* Joseon king to create Hangeul, making this incorrect.
* **D: Oñemoheñóiva jeporu katuirã opavépe g̃uarãva (Created for the correct sound for the teaching of the people):** This describes the *purpose* of Hangeul, but not what was actually created.
"
Hunmin Jeongeum achegety oñemoambue akue mba'épe?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The text states: ""Ko achegety oñemoheñói 1444-pe rey Sejong reinado jave (1418-1450). Rey Sejong ha’e Kuri irundyha rey Joseon dinastía-pegua ha ha’e oñemomba’eguasuvéva. Ñepyrũraite oñehenói achegety Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum he’iséva “Tyapu oĩporãva avakuéra ñemoarandurã”"" which translates to: ""This alphabet was created in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450). King Sejong is the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and he was a great scholar. Initially, he created the alphabet Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum, which means ""The correct sound for the teaching of the people"".""

Therefore, the alphabet created was Hangeul.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba’e ñe’ẽpa oguereko influencia sánscristo rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Latín ñe’ẽ**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sánscrito ha’e peteĩ ñe’ẽ ymaguare ha oñembojoja latín reh oñeñe’ẽva Europa-pe.""  This translates to ""Sanskrit is a language and it influenced Latin spoken in Europe.""

While Sanskrit influenced many languages, the text *specifically* mentions Latin as being influenced by it. Options B, C, and D are too broad.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'ére okañyrei sánscristo?","The correct answer is **D: Jerarquía-gui** (Due to hierarchy).

The text explicitly states: ""Upéi Upanishads oñembyaty rire, sánscrito okañyrei jerarquía rupive."" This translates to ""Then, after the Upanishads were composed, Sanskrit declined due to hierarchy.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oguerekopaitéva (Because it is versatile):** While the text mentions Sanskrit's versatility, it doesn't say versatility caused its decline.
* **B: Migración ária-gui (Due to the Aryan migration):** The Aryan migration is presented as one theory of Sanskrit's origin, not the reason for its decline.
* **C: Latín ñe’ẽ (Due to the Latin language):** The text compares Sanskrit to Latin, but doesn't suggest Latin caused Sanskrit's decline.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ã apytégui ha’e añetegua gravedad Io rehegua?","The correct answer is **B: Io gravedad ndeitirave, upéare ndevevuivéta**

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** A person weighing 90 kg on Earth weighs only 16 kg on Io.
* **Gravity is the force of attraction between objects with mass.**  The weight of an object is the force of gravity acting on it.
* **Io has weaker gravity than Earth.** This is why the person weighs significantly less on Io.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yvypegua gravedad ndeitirata sa'ive Io mba'egui (Human gravity is different from Io's composition):**  While Io's composition influences its gravity, the core reason is the *amount of mass* in Io.  The composition is relevant to how the gravity *is generated*, not the strength of the gravity itself.
* **C: Io gravedad ndeitirave, upéare ndepohyivéta (Io's gravity is the same, but it doesn't pull):**  This is incorrect. The problem shows the gravity *does* pull (the person loses weight).
* **D: Yvypegua gravedad ndeitirataveta Io mba'égui (Human gravity is different from Io's composition):**  Again, while Io's composition is relevant, the key is the mass, not just the composition.



**Therefore, the most accurate explanation is that Io's gravity is weaker than Earth's, and that's why the person weighs less.**  Option B captures this correctly."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ã mba’e oje’évagui ohechauka porã pe jasy corteza?","The correct answer is **A: Ipekue hi’ag̃uĩvévo** (Its height).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jasy corteza oguereko 70 km ipekue hi’ag̃uĩvévo ha 100 km mombyryveháguivo.""  This translates to ""The Earth's crust has a height of 70 km in depth and 100 km in extension.""  The passage specifically mentions the *height* of the crust.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ipo'ive altiplano výguio** (Its extension into the altiplano region). While mentioned, the passage focuses on the crust's height as a defining characteristic.
* **C: Sa'ive maría mombyryveháguivo** (Its extension into the ocean). Similar to B, this is mentioned but not the primary characteristic highlighted regarding what defines the crust.
* **D: Sa'ive maría altiplano výguio** (Its extension into the ocean and the altiplano region). This combines information that's not specifically used to *define* the crust in the passage.

Therefore, the height (ipekue hi’ag̃uĩvévo) is the most direct answer to what characteristics are mentioned to describe the crust."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, moõ ipoguasuve jasy corteza?","The correct answer is **A: Ag̃uĩvégotyo (By wind)**.

The text states: ""Jasy corteza oguereko 70 km ipekue hi’ag̃uĩvévo ha 100 km mombyryveháguivo."" This translates to: ""The Earth's crust has a thickness of 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.""  It then continues to mention that many rivers flow through the crust and are pushed up towards the altiplano.  The final sentence says that the crust is pushed up (oguasuve) *because* of the wind (ag̃uĩvégotyo) and the rivers.

Therefore, the wind (ag̃uĩvé) is the reason the Earth's crust is pushed up. While rivers are involved, the wind is the primary force mentioned in the text.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui oĩ tapicha oguerovíava?","The correct answer is **A: Avakuéra oikundahama ambue mbyjape (They will understand other worlds)**.

Here's why:

The question describes how humanity is increasingly aware of other possibilities – other worlds, what's beyond our understanding, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  The core of the question revolves around *future* understanding.  Option A directly addresses this future understanding, stating that future generations *will* understand other worlds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Avakuéra ndoikundahakuaái ambue mundo oĩva (They will not understand other worlds):** This contradicts the overall tone of the paragraph which suggests increasing awareness.
* **C: Tekove oĩkuaa ambue planeta-pe (There are civilizations on other planets):** While the paragraph mentions the possibility of civilizations on other planets, it doesn't say future generations *will* understand them. It focuses on humanity's evolving awareness.
* **D: Mbyajakuéra ndamombyryeterei oĩ ojuehegui (Generations will not be interested in exploring):** The paragraph *does* mention a growing desire to explore and understand the unknown.



"
Mba'e ipo'ive ohóvo eñemomombyryvévo kuarahy mbytégui?,"The correct answer is **C: Gas**.

The text states: ""Gas ipo’ive ohóvo oñemomombyryvévo kuarahy mbytégui."" This translates to ""When gas is expelled, it is ionized and emitted from the sun's surface."" Therefore, gas is what causes the emission from the sun's surface.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicga, mba'e jahechakuaa kuarahýre yvyape ari?","The correct answer is **C: Fotósfera**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuarahýre jahecháva ñamañávo hese héra fotosfera, he’iséva “Tata rendy apu’a”.""  This translates to ""What we see in the sun's surface is called the photosphere, which means 'Father's bright sky'.""

Therefore, the passage directly identifies the photosphere as what we see on the sun's surface from Earth.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ ape (A place):** While the photosphere *is* a location on the sun, the question asks specifically what we *see* from Earth, not just a general location.
* **B: Plasma:**  The sun *contains* plasma, but the photosphere is a specific layer *within* the sun, not plasma itself.
* **D: Kuarahy mbyte (Sun's core):** The core is deep inside the sun and not what we see from Earth.



"
Mba'e opytyvõ Copérnico remimo'ã?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuarahy ojoguaha Venus-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umi Venus fase-kuéra oykeko Copérnico remimo’ã he’íva umi planeta-kuéra ojereha kuarahy rehe."" This translates to: ""The phases of Venus made Copernicus's idea correct, which said the planets revolve around the Sun.""

Therefore, the phases of Venus provided evidence supporting Copernicus's heliocentric model (that the planets revolve around the Sun).
"
Mba'epa ohecha Galileo Galilei 1610-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Venus fase-kuéra**.

The text states: ""Ojapo mbohapysu rire rupi, 1610-pe. Italia-pegua astrónomo Galileo Galilei oipuru peteĩ telescopio ohecha hag̃uã Venus oguerekoha fase, jasýicha avei."" which translates to: ""In 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei built a telescope that observed Venus exhibiting phases, as well."" The phases of Venus are the key thing he observed.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, moõgui Ysyry guasu Amazonas ombyaty y?","The correct answer is **A: Ysyry michĩvévagui** (By smaller rivers).

The text states: ""Ombyatypaite y umi ysyry michĩvévagui."" which translates to ""It is formed by smaller rivers.""
"
Mba'e mención ndaha'éi Río Amazona mba'e?,"The correct answer is **B: Ysyry tuichavéva** (The largest river).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states ""Ysyry guasu Amazonas ha’e mokõiha ysyry guasu **tuichave** ha ipukuvéva yvy ápe ári."" (The Amazon River is the second largest river **in terms of size** and the most voluminous river in the world.)
* Therefore, it is *not* the largest river. The text indicates there's a larger one.

The other options are all stated as facts in the text:

* **A: Mokõiha ysyry guasu pukuvéva** (The second largest voluminous river) - The text says it's the second largest in terms of volume.
* **C: Ysyry pukuvéva** (The most voluminous river) - The text states it's the most voluminous.
* **D: Ysyry ipevéva** (A river that floods) - The text mentions it floods 6 miles wide.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva tembiapo pa'ũme ojapo sa'ive umi Venezuela-gua?,"The correct answer is **A: Agricultura**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dos tercio umi Venezuela-gua hembiapóva apytépe oñemongu’e sector servicio-pe, haimete peteĩ cuarta parte omba’apo industria-pe ha quinta parte agricultura-pe."" 

This translates to: ""Two-thirds of employed Venezuelans work in the service sector, one-fourth work in industry, and one-fifth work in agriculture.""

Therefore, agriculture is the sector where the smallest percentage of Venezuelans are employed.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva tembiapo pa'ũme ojapo hetave umi Venezuela-gua?","The correct answer is **A: Servicio (Service)**.

The text states: ""Dos tercio umi Venezuela-gua hembiapóva apytépe oñemongu’e sector servicio-pe"" which translates to ""Two-thirds of employed Venezuelans work in the service sector.""
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épe opytyvõ joaju rupi mbyjakuérape?","The correct answer is **A: Omoheñói hag̃ua elemento ipohyivéva (Produção de elementos radioativos)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Mbyjakuéra ojoaju rupi, umi átomo hidrogeno ojoaju rupi omoheñói hag̃ua elemento ipohyivéva."" This translates to: ""Through fusion, hydrogen atoms produce radioactive elements.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojejapo fusión rehegua reactor (Construção de um reator de fusão):** While the text mentions the goal of building a fusion reactor, the question asks what *helps* with fusion, not what the goal is.
* **C: Ome'ẽ mimbi ha haku (Produzir calor e energia):** While fusion *does* produce heat and energy, the text specifically highlights the creation of radioactive elements as a consequence.
* **D: Ojapo átomo hidrogeno (Produção de átomos de hidrogênio):** The text states that hydrogen atoms are *used* in fusion, not that fusion *produces* them.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Mba'erã oikóta ojejapóramo peteĩ fusión rehegua reactor ojeporukuaáva hekopete?,"The correct answer is **C: Átomo-kuéra (Atoms)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that fusion involves hydrogen atoms combining to create energy. 
* The goal is to create a reactor that can harness this fusion process. 
* The core of the process is the interaction of atoms (specifically, hydrogen atoms).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Hidrógeno (Hydrogen):** While hydrogen is *involved*, the question asks *how* a fusion reactor is made. The reactor needs to contain and control the atoms, not just hydrogen itself.
* **B: Mbyja (Plasma):** Plasma is a state of matter where atoms are ionized. While plasma is *created* in a fusion reactor, it's not the fundamental building block of the reactor itself.
* **D: Energía (Energy):** Fusion *produces* energy; it's not the thing the reactor is made of.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: Átomo-kuéra (Atoms)**.  The reactor is designed to manipulate and contain the atoms involved in the fusion reaction.



"
Mba'e ha'e composición química y rehegua?,"The correct answer is **D: Mokõi hidrógeno átomo ha peteĩ oxígeno átomo rehe**.

The text states: ""Y compuesto-va oñemohenda mokõi hidrógeno átomo ha oxígeno átomo rehe."" which translates to ""The compound is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""
"
"Y forma oñemoambuéramo jepe, mba'e noñemoambue mõ'ái?","The correct answer is **C: Estado físico (Physical state)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Umi elemento ikatu ohasa peteĩ estado-gui ambue estado-pe iñambue’ỹrehe."" (Elements can change from one state to another.) This directly refers to physical states (solid, liquid, gas).
* **The text also mentions:** ""Jepéramo estado físico ikatu iñambue, estado químico noñemoambue kuaái."" (However, the physical state can change, but the chemical state cannot.) This reinforces the idea that the question is about the changing physical state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Estructura molecular (Molecular structure):**  Molecular structure remains the same during a change of state. It's the arrangement of atoms, not the state itself, that changes.
* **B: Pohýi (Volatility/Evaporation):** Volatility describes how easily a substance evaporates, but it's not the *change* that occurs when a substance changes state.
* **D: Nitrógeno líquido (Liquid nitrogen):** Liquid nitrogen is *one* state of nitrogen, but the question asks what changes when *any* physical state changes.



Therefore, the change from one state to another is a change in the **physical state**.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ã apytégui ndaha'éi apañuãi umi paapy estado-kuérape oipokatu hag̃ua léi-kuéra?","The correct answer is **D: Ndapóri rupi peteĩ mburuvichavete (Lack of a common treasury)**.

The text states: ""Congreso ndaipokatúi omoĩ hag̃uã impuesto ha, ndapóri rupi peteĩ mburuvichavete, oĩjey tavusu mburuvichakuéra poguýpe, noipytyvõ guasúiva ichupe, oñemoneĩ hag̃uã léipe oñemboguapýva.""  This translates to: ""Congress could not levy taxes and, lacking a common treasury, the people of the states were unwilling to help it, preventing it from enacting laws and enforcing them.""

The lack of a common treasury is the fundamental problem preventing the Congress from effectively enacting and enforcing laws across the states.  The other options are consequences of this lack of a treasury, not the core reason why the states didn't want to follow the laws.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytepe omombe'u porã tetã rekuái Revolución aja?","The correct answer is **A: Impuesto oñemombarete Congreso ha tavusu mburuvichakuéra rupi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Congress couldn't levy taxes and lacked the power to create a national currency. This inability to collect taxes is a core issue highlighted as a reason why the Confederation failed. The passage also mentions the need for taxes to support the Congress and the people. Therefore, the lack of tax power is a key characteristic of the weak national government that led to the Revolution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umi marandukuéra oguerekova’erã umi Congreso ñemoneĩ** (The states disagreed with the Congress's summoning): While disagreement existed, the passage focuses on the practical inability of the Congress to function *due to lack of power*, not simply on disagreements.
*   **C: Tavusu mburuvichakuéra ndaipokatúi** (The people were not able to): The passage doesn't say the people weren't able to do something. It focuses on the Congress's inability to act.
*   **D: Tetã Rekúai oreko mokõi ipypegua** (The nation had two halves): This refers to the existence of two states within the nation, not the problem with the national government itself.

Therefore, option A directly addresses the central problem of the weak national government as described in the passage.

This translates to: ""In the Declaration of Independence, these words “Independence declared on the 14th of July, 1776” are written in a **code** that is hidden within the parchment.""

Therefore, the words are not just written; they are encoded.
"
Mba'ére ojeikuaave Singapúr-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín-kuéra rupi (Through gardens)**.

The text states that the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped to create a tropical City Garden on the island. This means the Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid was introduced *through* the gardens.
"
Mba'epa ha’e hína Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Peteĩ yvoty (A flower)**.

The text states that Vanda Miss Joaquim is a hybrid of orchids. Orchids are flowers.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e porãguipa umi pirámide de Giza ndojehecharamo'ãiva'ekue Imperio pyahúpegua egipcio-pe?","The correct answer is **D: Ijejapo** (They were built).

Here's why:

The question asks *why* the pyramids of Giza weren't destroyed during the decline of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. The passage states that many works were neglected and forgotten during the decline, *except* for the pyramids.  The reason they survived is because they *were built* (ijejapo) well. They were so well-constructed that they withstood the decline.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hi ary** (Those years) - This doesn't make sense in the context of the question.
* **B: Ita jeporu** (That beautiful) - While the pyramids are beautiful, the passage doesn't focus on their beauty as the reason for their survival.
* **C: Ituicháha** (The tallest) - This is irrelevant to the question of why they survived.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, moõguipa ou ka'avo'uha okyeterei rupi?","The correct answer is **B: Colina norte-pegua** (North hill).

The text states: ""oho sur gotyo umi llanura-pe, ohasávo río Mara, colina norte-pegua guive okyeteri rupi."" which translates to ""It travels south to the plains, crossing the Mara River, and then climbs the north hill.""
"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, moõgui ka'avo'uha oho jasyrundi rupi?","The correct answer is **C: Río Mara-gui**.

The text states: ""oho sur gotyo umi llanura-pe, ohasávo río Mara, colina norte-pegua guive okyeteri rupi. Ha upéi ojevy jey norte gotyo oeste guio, ohasa jeývo río Mara, okypa rire jasyrundy rupi."" This translates to: ""It travels south to the plains, crossing the Mara River, and then after that, it travels north to the west, crossing the Mara River, arriving at the river.""

Therefore, the wildebeest cross the Mara River to reach the river.
"
"Pe Operación Sealion, moõgua tetã jeike ha’e raka'e?","The correct answer is **B: Gran Bretaña**.

The text states: ""Alemania oñepyrũ oñembosako’i oike hag̃ua mbaretépe **Gran Bretaña-pe**."" (Germany initially planned to invade **Great Britain**.) The Operation Sealion was the German plan to invade Great Britain.
"
Mba'éicha ombohéra Alemania ijeroike Gran Bretaña-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Operación Sealion**.

The text explicitly states: ""Alemania ombohéra ijeroike """"Operación Sealion"""""". This translates to ""Germany called the invasion """"Operation Sealion""""""

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dunkerque:** Dunkerque was the location where the British army retreated, not the name of the German invasion plan.
* **C: Kriegsmarine:** This refers to the German Navy, not the invasion plan itself.
* **D: Royal Navy:** This refers to the British Navy, which fought against the German invasion.



"
Mba'epa noñemombe'úi oñeikotevẽha Italia ojapyhy hag̃ua Africa-pegua tetãnguéra?,"The correct answer is **C: Oguerekova'erã peteĩ plataforma tropa-kuéra g̃uarã (It creates a troop platform)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Italia ohupytyse umi Africa-pegua tetãnguéra. Ojapyhy hag̃uã umi tetãnguéra oguerekova’erã peteĩ plataforma tropa-kuéra, ikatuhag̃uãicha oike Mar Mediterráneo rupive ha ohekojopy Africa-pe.""  This translates to: ""Italy has a foothold in African countries. It uses these countries to create a troop platform, allowing it to access the Mediterranean Sea and deploy to Africa.""

Option C directly reflects this statement. While option A is related (Italy *does* have bases in Egypt), the main point about *using* African countries is to create a platform. Options B and D are not accurately supported by the text.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba’epa raka’e ojapose Italia pe ñorairõhápe?","The correct answer is **A: Ojapyhy tetãnguéra África-pegua (It projects power towards African countries)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Italia ohupytyse umi Africa-pegua tetãnguéra"" which translates to ""Italy projects power towards African countries."" While the other options are mentioned, projecting power is the main action highlighted in relation to Italy's foreign policy in this text.
"
Máva oñoñe’ẽme’ẽva’ekue invasores-ndive?,"The correct answer is **A: Alemán-kuéra** (Germans).

The text states: ""Oñembopokatuva’ekue umi francés ojeherova “Vichy”... omba’apova’ekue umi invasores-ndive y ndaha’éi oñorãirõva hendivekuéra."" This translates to: ""The French were known as ""Vichy""... they collaborated with the invaders and not with those who were not invaders.""  The ""invaders"" are identified as the Germans.
"
Máva oĩ ra'e Operación Dragón ryepype?,"The correct answer is **A: Estadounidense ha Francia-guáva isãsomava (American and French forces)**.

The text states: ""15 jasypoapy jave ary 1940-pe, umi aliado-kuéra ojeroike hikuái Francia sur gotyo, ko jeroike guasu ojeherova’ekue “Operación Dragón” Mokõi arapokõindy ryepýpe, **umi estadounidense ha Francia-guáva isãsõmáva**, omosãsõ avei Francia sur-pe y ohoitéma hikuái Alemania gotyo."" (On September 15, 1940, the allies launched a major offensive in southern France, this major offensive was called ""Operation Dragoon"" on the second half of the year, **led by American and French forces**, and they also liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany.)

The text explicitly mentions American and French forces as the ones leading Operation Dragoon.
"
Mba'e oñembokatypyryve rupi submarino-kuéra oñapymĩ?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ñorãirõ ñepyrũme, opavave submarino oikundaha ysyry guasu ári, hakatu radar oñembokatypyryvépe..."" which translates to ""At the beginning of the war, the submarine would dive with the great sea, because radar was being used...""

Therefore, radar was the technology used to detect submarines.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U-Boats:** U-boats are the German submarines, not the reason they are detected.
*   **B: Mbokapu mombyry (Ballast tanks):** Ballast tanks control a submarine's buoyancy, but they are not directly related to how submarines are detected.
*   **C: Ygarata (Depth):** While submarines use depth to hide, it's the radar that allows others to detect them *even when* they are submerged.



"
"Ojeporu tenondérõguare submarino, mba'e ne'ĩra gueteri mombyry?","The correct answer is **A: Ygarata (Depth)**.

The text states: ""Upéramo guare imbegue gueteri hikuái ha nombokapúi gueteri mombyry."" which translates to ""Furthermore, they dive very deep and can carry very heavy loads."" The question asks what a submarine can do more than other ships. The answer is depth.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva opyrũ py'aguapy ñe'ẽme'ẽ ári? ","The correct answer is **D: Unión Soviética-gua**.

The text states: ""...800.000 soldado Ejercito pytã Unión Soviéticaguáva oike..."" which translates to ""...800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered..."".  This indicates the Soviet Union initiated the invasion.
"
Mávapa ko’ã apytégui ndojapóiva’ekue Ejército pytã?,"The correct answer is **B: Invasión región oriental-pe** (Invasion in the eastern region).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...800.000 soldado Ejército pytã Unión Soviéticaguáva oike **ojapo mokõi frente Bielorrusia-gua ha Ucrania-gua ojepo rire invasión Polonia región oriental opyrũvo Riga py'aguapy ñe'ẽme'ẽ**...""

This translates to: ""...800,000 soldiers of the Red Army entered to **make two fronts, one in Belarus and one in Ukraine, after invading the eastern region of Poland, starting with the Riga talks**...""

The question asks *why* the Red Army didn't adhere to the agreements. The text indicates they didn't adhere because they invaded the eastern region of Poland.
"
Mba'e ojehu Ingeniero Mburuvicha Paha Ejército Italia-guape?,"The correct answer is **A: Oity chupe hikuái Fuerte Capuzzo-pe**.

The text states: ""Peteĩ ñuháme Bardia kuarahy reike gotyo, umi Británico oity Ingeniero Mburuvicha Paha Ejército Italia-gua, General Lastucci-pe."" which translates to ""A few days later, near Bardia, the British captured the Chief Engineer of the Italian Army, General Lastucci."" and immediately following that ""Mburuvicha Italo Balbo... ojejuka peteĩ angirũ jejapipe oguejy jave Tobrukpe."" which translates to ""Chief Italo Balbo... was wounded in a skirmish near Tobruk.""

Therefore, General Lastucci, the Chief Engineer of the Italian Army, was captured at Fuerte Capuzzo.
"
Moõ ojejuka Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk-pe**.

The text states: ""Jasypoteĩ 28 pe, Mburuvicha Italo Balbo, Tendota Guasu Libia pe gua ha jararã Mussoline pe, ojejuka peteĩ angirũ jejapipe oguejy jave Tobrukpe.""  This translates to: ""On September 28, General Italo Balbo, Commander-in-Chief of Libya and Mussolini's right-hand man, was seen in a small group arriving in Tobruk.""
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ha'e meditación Tibetana-pe tuicha mba'e?","The correct answer is **C: Deidad jehecha**.

The text states: ""Meditación tibetana rendaite hína Deida Yoga. **Mba'ejehecha rupi heta deidad omopotĩ energía rape, oñemyandy chakras-kuéra ha ojejapo iluminación andu.**"" (Tibetan meditation is called Deida Yoga. **Through the visualization of deities, energy is awakened, chakras are aligned, and enlightenment is achieved.**)

Therefore, the visualization of deities is highlighted as a key element of Tibetan meditation.
"
"""Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'éichapa chakra oñemomba'apo meditación tibetana """"rendaite"""" aja?""","The correct answer is **B: Deidad jehecha**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Meditación tibetana rendaite hína Deida Yoga. **Mba'ejehecha rupi heta deidad omopotĩ energía rape, oñemyandy chakras-kuéra ha ojejapo iluminación andu.**"" (Tibetan meditation is called Deida Yoga. **Through the visualization of deities, much energy is awakened, the chakras are aligned, and enlightenment is achieved.**)

While yoga postures (A), mantras (C), and mudras (D) are part of Tibetan practice, the text explicitly connects the visualization of deities (deidad jehecha) with the awakening of energy and chakra alignment. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Máva ohapykueho canción devocional rupive ko programa?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanju Sharma**.

The text explicitly states: ""Puraheihára Sanju Sharma omoñepyrũ vy’arã, ohapykueho chupe jai Shankar Choudhary.""  This translates to ""Singer Sanju Sharma begins with a song, then sings for Jai Shankar Choudhary."" Therefore, Sanju Sharma is the first singer mentioned as performing a devotional song.
"
Máva opurahéi canción devocional tembi'u ñeikuave'ẽ jave?,"The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text explicitly states: ""Upéi, Lakkha Singh oñepyrũ ijehegui ha opurahéi los bhajans."" which translates to ""Then, Lakkha Singh started and sang the bhajans."" The text also mentions Lakkha Singh performing the 108 Chhappan Bhog devotional songs.
"
Mávapa ha’eva’ekue pe penúltimo espectáculo ko pyharépe?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina ha Haris Alexiou**.

The question asks about the penúltimo (second-to-last) show. The text states that Diva Tuquía brings together Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou. Sezen Aksu is also mentioned as part of the lineup. Therefore, the second-to-last show includes Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou.
"
Moõ tetãgua ha'e Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Italia-gua**.

The text explicitly states: ""Diva Tuquía-gua omoha'ãnga kuri tenor italiagua Alessandro Safina..."" which translates to ""The diva Tuquía invites Italian tenor Alessandro Safina...""
"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mávapa ko’ã apytégui hina ha’e ñe'ẽrei?","The correct answer is **D: Sa’ivérõ hi’are kuri peteĩ aravo oñeguenohẽ ypy hag̃ua peteĩ tapicha upégui.**

Here's why:

* The passage compares a 90°F temperature to the feeling of being on a roller coaster.
* The main point of the comparison is the discomfort and potential danger of extreme heat, specifically relating it to the risk of heatstroke.
* Option D directly reflects this point, stating that it feels like a dangerous situation where someone could suffer from heatstroke.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiko tata guasu Santa Clara-pe (It's hot in Santa Clara):** While the passage mentions Santa Clara, it's not the main point of comparison.  The location is just where the firefighter is speaking from.
* **B: Avakuéra opa'ã peteĩ montaña rusa-pe (Everyone is on the same roller coaster):** This is a general statement and not the core message of the comparison.
* **C: Pasajero oñemboy'u (The passenger is uncomfortable):**  While passengers on a roller coaster *can* be uncomfortable, the analogy goes beyond just discomfort to the serious risk of heatstroke.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa he'i pe temperatura noĩporãiva rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Montaña rusa omomba'apóva (Rollercoaster)**.

Here's why:

The quote compares a 90°F temperature to the feeling of riding a rollercoaster.  The phrase ""Montaña rusa omomba'apóva"" translates to ""Rollercoaster that's being described.""  The whole analogy is comparing the feeling of intense heat to the intense feeling of a rollercoaster.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bombero-kuéra moakãha (Firefighters are being shown):** While firefighters are mentioned, the comparison isn't about them.
* **C: Pasajero-kuéra (Passengers):**  The quote is about the feeling experienced by passengers on a rollercoaster, but the analogy itself isn't about passengers.
* **D: Tahachi-kuéra moakãha (Children are being shown):** There's no mention of children in the quote.



"
Moõpa oiko kuri apañuãi energía rehegua tsunami rupive?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga-pe**.

The text states: ""Tonga-pe, electricidad katu ohókuri sapy'ami, ha pévagui tendota Togan-gua ndoikuaái Tsunami ñemomarandu og̃uenohẽva'ekue PTWC.""  This translates to ""In Tonga, electricity is available, and therefore the people of Tonga are not aware of the tsunami warning issued by the PTWC."" This directly addresses the question of where the energy issue (lack of awareness due to power outage) related to the tsunami occurred.

While other locations are mentioned in relation to the tsunami's occurrence, only Tonga is directly linked to an energy-related issue (electricity outage) preventing awareness of the warning.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oiko Tonga-pe oho haguére electricidad?","The correct answer is **D: Tendota Togan-gua ndoikuaái Tsunami ñemomarandu og̃uenohẽva'ekue PTWC.**

Here's why:

* The text states: "" electricidad katu ohókuri sapy'ami, ha pévagui tendota Togan-gua ndoikuaái Tsunami ñemomarandu og̃uenohẽva'ekue PTWC.""  This translates to: ""electricity still flows, and therefore the people of Tonga do not know the tsunami warning issued by the PTWC.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñemomarandu sa’i ñembyai (They are informed of the earthquake):** While an earthquake likely triggered the tsunami, the passage focuses on *why* the Tongan people didn't receive the warning.
* **B: Tendotakuéra ndohupytýi marandu umi advertencia ojeipe'áva rehe (The power grids do not transmit the issued warnings):** The passage says electricity *is* flowing, so this is incorrect.
* **C: Para retakue ojeafecta (For that reason it is affected):**  This is too general and doesn't specifically address what happened in Tonga related to the warning.



"
Araka'e rire ikatu ra'e tahachi oiporu imboka radar kuera oikuaa hag̃ua mba'e hatãpa oho kuri Karai Reid?,"The correct answer is **C: Ohasávo 160 km/h** (When he was traveling at 160 km/h).

The text states: ""Tahachi Nueva Zelanda pegua ijapañuãi kuri oipuru haguã upe imboka radar kuera oikuaa haguãã mba'e hatãpa oho kuri Karai Reid, **ikarapere Black Beauty, ha'e kuri omboguata 160 km/hpe**."" This translates to: ""New Zealand authorities issued a fine because the radar detected that Karai Reid, **driving Black Beauty, was traveling at 160 km/h**.""
"
"Ko maranduha he’iháicha, mba'ére hasy ra'e tahachípe oikuaa hag̃ua Johnny Reid mba'e hatãpa oho?","The correct answer is **A: Oho rupi sa'ive 160 km/h-gui** (He was speeding at 160 km/h).

The text explicitly states: ""Tahachi Nueva Zelanda pegua ijapañuãi kuri oipuru haguã upe imboka radar kuera oikuaa haguãã mba'e hatãpa oho kuri Karai Reid ikarapere Black Beauty, ha umi tahachi ikatu ocronometra kuri peteĩha añoite Karai Reidpe ha'e kuri ha'e omboguejyvo imboguata 160 km/hpe.""  This translates to: ""The authorities installed a radar trap that could detect how fast Mr. Reid was driving in his Black Beauty car, and the authorities timed him for a year and he was caught speeding at 160 km/h.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imba'yru mbegue rupi** (For some other reason) - The text directly links the radar trap to his speed.
* **C: Puente ári pokõijeynte ohasa** (He passed through the bridge at a lower speed) - The text says he was going 160 km/h *on* the bridge.
* **D: Pe Puente Auckland Harbour ituja** (The Auckland Harbour Bridge itself) - The text is about the radar trap and his speed, not the bridge's construction.



"
Moõ oñemopyenda raka'e pe yvyryrýi Butte rehehápe?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 milla yvy gotyope**.

The text states: ""Yvyryrýi oiko'ypy 20 kilómetro (15 milla) Dillon yvate-yvate ha kuarahy resẽ gotyope **y 65 kilómetro (40 milla) rupi Butte yvy gotyope**."" This translates to ""The fire was 20 kilometers (15 miles) upwind of Dillon and 65 kilometers (40 miles) downwind of Butte.""  The question asks for the distance *to* Butte, and the text specifies 40 miles downwind.
"
Mba'epa oikova’ekue Abu Ghraib-pe motín jave?,"The correct answer is **A: Tapicha monambipyre kuera abuso** (People committed cruel acts).

Here's why:

* The question asks ""What was there in the Abu Ghraib prison riot?"".
* The passage states: ""Ka'irãi Irak pegua Abu Ghraib oñemyendy kuri upe motin jave. Upe ka'irãi ojeikuaa porã kuri tapicha monambipyre kuera abuso ojetopa upepe umi milíko Americano cargope opyta rire."" which translates to ""A prison riot occurred in Abu Ghraib, Iraq. The prison riot was known for cruel acts committed by people as American soldiers were stationed there.""

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the riot involved cruel acts committed by people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñemboty (Crime)** - While the acts were criminal, the passage doesn't directly state the riot *was* a crime. It describes the *acts* within the riot.
* **C: Milíko americano opyta cargope (American soldiers were stationed there)** - This describes a location, not what *happened* in the riot.
* **D: Ka'irãi oñemyendypa (Prison riot)** - This is a general description of the event, not what *was in* the riot itself.
"
Mba'ére ojeikuaa ka'irãi Irak-pegua? ,"The correct answer is **D: Tapicha monambipyre kuera abuso** (People were subjected to cruel abuse).

Here's why:

* The question asks ""What is the prison in Iraq known for?""
* The text states ""Upe ka'irãi ojeikuaa porã kuri tapicha monambipyre kuera abuso ojetopa upepe umi milíko Americano cargope opyta rire."" which translates to ""The prison is well-known for people being subjected to cruel abuse after American soldiers took charge.""

While options A and B are related, they aren't the *known characteristic* of the prison. The defining aspect is the abuse. Option C is mentioned as a consequence *resulting from* the prison's reputation, but it's not the core reason for its notoriety.

Therefore, option D accurately captures the central point of the text.
"
Mba'éichagua jeguerohyhapa oiko ra'e Estado Maui War Memorial-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñembopu (Concert)**.

The question states: ""Pe musico kuera ombopaha kuri **ñembopu** upe Estado Maui War Memorialpe..."" which translates to ""The musician held a **concert** at the State Maui War Memorial..."".  Therefore, the answer must be ""Ñembopu"".
"
Mávapa ome'ẽ kuri ñe’ẽmombe’u mba'érepa oñembopa upe ñembopu?,"The correct answer is **B: Músico rendota mba'apoha (The musician's management company)**.

The passage states: ""Upe músico rendota mba'apoha, HK Management Inc., nome'ẽi ñepyrũra mba'érepa ombopaha 20 Jasyporundypegua, ombojákuri ñemongu'e rehe upe ambue árape."" This translates to: ""The musician's management company, HK Management Inc., did not initially say why they were holding the concert on January 20th, and they are rescheduling it for another date.""

Therefore, the management company is the source of the information regarding the reason for the concert and its rescheduling.
"
Mávapa oimo'ã heta tapicha oikóva Bishkek-pe ha’eha responsable pe ñemondagui?,"The correct answer is **A: Tahachikuéra (They)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tahachikuéra ndaipóri rupi Bishkek tapére."" which translates to ""They are not in Bishkek."" 

The sentence then explains that people in Bishkek are looking for someone who can facilitate the meeting (""mburuvicha'ỹ"").  Therefore, ""they"" (referring to the people who are not in Bishkek) are responsible for the facilitation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mba'e repy ñemuha (The negotiation/agreement)**: The negotiation isn't responsible for finding a facilitator.
* **C: Ojepytasova (The meeting)**:  The meeting itself isn't responsible for facilitating.
* **D: Mitãrusukuéra (The Russians)**: The text doesn't mention Russians being responsible.

Therefore, the only logical answer based on the text is **A: Tahachikuéra**.
"
Mávapa omboja umi ojepytasóvare ñemonda?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkek-gua**.

Here's why:

The passage says: ""Heta tapicha oikóva Bishkek-pe omboja umi ojepytasóvare ha'éva yvy gotyogua upe mburuvicha'ỹre."" This translates to: ""Many people who live in Bishkek are wary of the people who gather around this leader.""

Therefore, ""Bishkek-gua"" (people from Bishkek) is the group wary of the leader.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tahachikuéra** (They): This refers to the people who are gathering around the leader. The question is asking *who* is wary.
*   **C: Anarquista-kuéra** (Anarchists): The passage doesn't mention anarchists.
*   **D: Yvypóra aty** (People's association/collective): While the passage mentions people gathering, it doesn't specify they are a formal ""people's association."""
Araka'e ojupi ñemu?,"The correct answer is **B: Oñeme'ẽ rupi chupe pirapire 2013-pe**.

The text states: ""Siminoff he'íkuri pe ñemu ojupi tuicha ha'e osẽ rire Shark Tank episodio-pe 2013-pe..."" which translates to ""Siminoff said that his breakthrough was when he appeared on the Shark Tank episode in 2013...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Osẽ rire Shark Tank episodio-pe:** While appearing on Shark Tank was significant, the text highlights the breakthrough *happened* when he appeared.
* **C: Osẽ rire QVC-pe:** Appearing on QVC is mentioned later in the text, not as the initial breakthrough.
* **D: Omohenda rire peteĩ demanda mba'apoha ADT-ndive:** The lawsuit is mentioned as a later development, not the initial breakthrough.



"
Araka'e Jamie Siminoff omoñerypũ Ring?,"The correct answer is **B: Osẽ vaire rire Shark Tank rupi**.

The text states: ""Siminoff he'íkuri pe ñemu ojupi tuicha ha'e osẽ rire Shark Tank episodio-pe 2013-pe..."" which translates to ""Siminoff said that the negotiations were very close and he appeared on a Shark Tank episode in 2013...""  This indicates that appearing on Shark Tank was a significant early event for Ring.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Itimbre ndoiko porãi rupi (The doorbell wasn't good):** While the doorbell wasn't initially perfect, the text focuses on the *launch* of the company and the Shark Tank appearance.
* **C: Oñeme'ẽ rupi chupe pirapire (He offered his idea):**  Offering the idea is a general event, and the text highlights the *specific* event of appearing on Shark Tank.
* **D: Osẽ porã rire QVC-pe (He appeared well on QVC):**  Appearing on QVC happened later (in 2017) and is less of a defining early event than the Shark Tank appearance.



"
Mba'e recomendación ome'ẽ peteĩteĩ episodio-kuéra Lectura de Arco Iris-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Biblioteca local-kuéra**.

The text states: ""Peteĩteĩ episodio ojesarekota hina peteĩ temare peteĩ kuatia ñe'ẽ rehegua ha upei omohesakã pe tema oipuruvo heta mombe'urã kuéra. **Peteĩteĩ Show avei ome'ẽta hina recomendación mitã peguarã kuatiañe'ẽ ha'ekuéra oheka vaerã oho jave upe bibliotecape.**"" (One episode addresses a language theme and presents topics that interest many children. **The Show also gives a good recommendation for children to go to the library.**)
"
Mba'e ocontribuine ra'e Lectura de Arco Iris opa hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **C: John Grant he'íva**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ambue tapicha kuéra ocree hina, peape oike avei John Grant, he'i mokõiveva umi fondo kuéra ha pe jere oikova upe filosofia educacional pe programa ta'anga mbyry pe ocontribui kuri opa haguã pe serie kuéra."" This translates to: ""Other people believe, and John Grant also says, that the funds and the educational philosophy behind the program contribute in every way to the series.""

While John Grant *does* mention the funds and educational philosophy, the question asks what ""Lectura de Arco Iris"" contributes to *in general*. The passage highlights that John Grant specifically says the program contributes to the series.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndaipóri pirapire (No answer):** The passage *does* give an answer.
* **B: Ndorekói rupi premio Emmy (Doesn't win Emmy awards):** The passage states that the program *wins* Emmy awards.
* **D: Mister Roger's Neighborhood-pe oho porãve rupi (Goes well in Mister Roger's Neighborhood):** The passage doesn't mention Mister Roger's Neighborhood.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: John Grant he'íva**. The passage attributes the contribution to the program to John Grant.
"

Here's why:

The question asks what *isn't* a statement made in the text about the Amsterdam tulips and Anne Frank's diary.  Let's break down the options:

* **A: Ho'apotaiteha (It's quite interesting)** - This is a general observation about the tulips and diary, not a specific statement *made in* the text.
* **B: Ojeñangarekova'erã hese (They are related)** - The text explicitly states the tulips and Anne Frank's diary are connected because the tulips were grown in the same place Anne Frank hid. This *is* a statement *made in* the text.
* **C: Ombohasyha peteĩ urupe (It makes one sad)** - This expresses an emotion about the connection, not a specific statement *made in* the text.
* **D: Ikatu ombyai avaetagua resãi (It can teach people a lesson)** -  This is also an interpretation or consequence of the connection, not a direct statement *made in* the text.

Therefore, the only option that *isn't* a direct statement *made in* the text is ""They are related.""

"RSPCA inspector mbohapehára rupive, mba'e rehe ojesareko meme va'erä?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV cámara**.

The text states: ""RSPCA inspector mbohapehára David O'Shannessy, he'i kuri ABC-pe ñeñangareko ha jesareko mymba jejukaha rehe ojejapo meme va'erãha Australia-pe. **CCVT añetehápe oikuaauka mbaretéta umi tapicha omba'apóva mbymba ndivepe ijeguerekoporã tuicha mba'eha.**""

This translates to: ""RSPCA inspector David O'Shannessy said to ABC that memes are made in Australia about animal cruelty. **With CCTV footage, it clearly shows people abandoning animals.**""

Therefore, the memes are based on CCTV footage.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oikuaauka mbaretéta tapicha omba'apóva mbymba ndivepe ijeguerekoporã tuicha mba'eha?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV cámara ñemoĩ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""CCVT añetehápe oikuaauka mbaretéta umi tapicha omba'apóva mbymba ndivepe ijeguerekoporã tuicha mba'eha."" This translates to: ""Thanks to the CCTV camera, it is clearly seen what people report about the excessive cruelty to animals.""

Therefore, the CCTV camera is what provides the clear evidence.
"
"Ko maranduha he’iháicha, mba'e profesión-gua ha’eva'ekue pe ojedeteneva?","The correct answer is **A: Estudiante (Student)**.

The text explicitly states: ""...y umi estudiante ojearresta avei..."" which translates to ""...and other students were also arrested..."".  The question asks about the profession of the victims."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháica, mboy víctima funeral pa oiko hina ra'e ojedetenévoguare hína ambuepe?","The correct answer is **B: Mbohapy**.

The text states: ""...Jeff Weise funeral pe ha ambue **mbohapy** victima porundy apytegui ojedetene..."" which translates to ""...the funeral of Jeff Weise and **three other** victims were buried..."".
"
"Ko'ã protesta rupi, mba'e tetã ndofirmái kuri pe acuerdo ACTA?","The correct answer is **B: Polonia**.

The text states: ""Pe Jasy ohasa vaekue, oiko peteĩ protesta tuichava Polonia pe upe tetã ofirma kuri ACTA, ha pea ogueraha kuri pe gobierno polaco ani haguã oratifica ko acuerdo ko'agã."" This translates to: ""In July, a large protest was held in Poland because the country did not sign ACTA, and the Polish government did not ratify this agreement.""
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã tetã apytépe omombegue upe proceso oike hag̃ua ACTA-pe?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The text explicitly states: ""Latvia ha Eslovaquia mokõiveva omombegue hina pe proceso jeike haguã ACTApe."" (Latvia and Slovakia have both initiated the ratification process for ACTA.)

While other countries are mentioned protesting ACTA, Latvia and Slovakia are the ones actively involved in the ratification process according to the provided text.
"
Mboy tapicha okai'imi iPod osẽ vaíva ombuakupahaguépe rupi?,"The correct answer is **B: 27**.

The text states: ""Ministerio Economía, Comercio ha Industria, Japon-gua (METI) he'i kuri oikuaahague 27 omba'ejehu va'ekue ojoajúva ko'ã tembiporu osẽ vaívagui."" This translates to ""The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) reported that it was aware of 27 reports of devices being defective.""

The question asks how many people were affected by the defective iPods. The text says 27 *reports* of defective devices were received, not the number of people affected. However, among the given options, 27 is the number associated with the reported incidents.
"
Máva he'i incidente ombuakupahaguépe ndaha'eiha tuicha mba'e?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The text states: ""Arapokõindy ohasa va'ekuépe Apple omomarandu kuri ambue 34 incidente ombuakupahaguépe, ha ñemuha he'i kuri ndaha'eiha tuicha mba'e.""

This translates to: ""Later, Apple reported another 34 incidents of battery swelling, and the report said it wasn't much.""

Therefore, Apple is the one who reported the incidents that ""ndaha'eiha tuicha mba'e"" (weren't much).
"
"Oñe'ẽ aja, mba'e he'i Steve Jobs Apple ombopyahujeýtaha?","The correct answer is **A: Marandekohai**.

The passage says: """"Ko árape Apple ombopyahujeýta ñe'ẽmbyry, ore rojapóta marandekohai ko árape"""" which translates to: """"Today Apple is releasing communication, we are creating a revolution today.""""

Therefore, Steve Jobs says Apple is releasing **a revolution** (marandekohai).
"
Mba'ére Steve Jobs oñe'ẽ mokõi aravo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ohechauka hag̃ua ñe'ẽmbyry pyahu** (He announced a tablet).

Here's why:

The text says: ""Apple mburuvicha Steve Jobs ohechauka kuri upe dispositivo oguatahavo upe noha'agahape ha oguenohẽvo upe iPhone ivaquero bolsillogui."" This translates to: ""Apple's president Steve Jobs unveiled a device that is thin and light and can fit in your pocket, the iPhone.""

The following sentence says: ""Upe mokõi aravo oñe'ẽ aja, ha'e he'íkuri: """"Ko árape Apple ombopyahujeýta ñe'ẽmbyry, ore rojapóta marandekohai ko árape"""""" which translates to: ""Two days later, he said: ""Today Apple is introducing a revolution, we will create a revolution today.""""

The context suggests the ""revolution"" is the introduction of the iPhone (and, by extension, the beginning of Apple's foray into tablet computers).  The options provided list ""tablets,"" ""computers,"" and ""the internet.""  Since the iPhone was a groundbreaking device, the most accurate answer is that Steve Jobs announced the **tablet** (which the iPhone essentially pioneered).

While the iPhone was revolutionary, the question refers to what he *announced*. The entire narrative points to the launch of a new type of device – a tablet, not just an iPhone.
"
Mba'e omomarandu Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner Argentina Teatro-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Omomarandu kuri iñintención oñanitaha senadorarã** (She is informing about her intention to run for senator).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ña Kirchner omomarandu kuri iñintencion oñanitaha mburuvichara Argentina Teatrope..."" which translates to ""Mrs. Kirchner is informing about her intention to run for senator in Argentina Theater...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojecandidataha mburuvicharã** (She is a candidate for president) - While she was a presidential candidate, the text specifically mentions her intention to run for senator.
* **C: Icampaña provincia Buenos Aires atyhápe oikóvaguáicha** (Her campaign is as it was in the province of Buenos Aires) -  The text discusses her intention to run *in Argentina Theater*, not about a current campaign.
* **D: Omomarandu hag̃ua iretiro senado-gui** (She is informing about her retirement from the senate) - The text explicitly states she's *intending to run* for senator, not retiring.



"
Moõ kuri Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner omomarandu iñintencion oñanitaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ teatro opytáva 31 milla La Plata-gui** (A theater located 31 miles from La Plata).

Here's why:

* The question asks *where* Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her intention to run.
* The text states she announced it at a theater *located 31 miles from La Plata*. 
* Option A accurately reflects this information.
* The other options are incorrect because they misplace the theater or misstate the distance.
"
Mba'e otopa raka'e ACMA Big Brother rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Nombohovakéi léi ñemokirirĩ rehegua** (Doesn't regulate online content).

The text explicitly states: ""Big Brother nombohovakéi léi ñemokirirĩ rehegua ha'éva ojehupíva online rehegua"" which translates to ""Big Brother doesn't regulate online content.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi oñemomarãndúva oñeñongatu Big Brother web rendápe** (Those who complain are aggregated on the Big Brother website) - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Ombohovake léi ñemokirirĩ rehegua** (Regulates online content) - The text directly contradicts this.
* **D: Ojejuhu contenido oikoha teterehe peteĩ servidor-pe** (Content is found on their own server) - While the text mentions content is on a server, it doesn't state that *ACMA* finds it there.  It relates to the general location of online content, not specific to ACMA's actions.



"

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...umi oñemomarãndúva noñeñongatuihaguére Big Brother web rendápe. Léi Mosarambiha Pytyvõ rehegua ohechauka ñemohenda ha'éva Internet-pe ojehupíva rehegua, ha katu, ha'e hag̃ua Internet-pe ojehupíva, oĩmanteva'erã teterehe peteĩ servidor-pe.""  This translates to: ""...those who are monitored are not connected to the Big Brother web page. The Law on Assistance provides information about those who are online, and furthermore, those who are online exist on a separate server.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Osẽva'erã Internet-pe** (They appear on the Internet): While technically true, it's not the *specific* information the passage highlights about where they *exist* in relation to the Big Brother system.
* **C: Ndaikatúi oñeñongatu web rendape** (They cannot be connected to the web page): The passage says they *are not* connected to the web page, but it doesn't say they *can't* exist elsewhere.
* **D: Ojehechaporãva'erã ACMA guive** (They are approved by ACMA): The passage doesn't mention ACMA at all.



"
Máva ha'e tendota Partido Liberal Australia-pegua?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The text states that Peter Costello believes the Liberal party *should* allow nuclear energy in Australia, and John Howard is the Prime Minister of the Liberal party. Therefore, John Howard is the leader of the Liberal party in Australia.
"
Mba'ére Australia ndoguerekóima energía nuclear industria?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndaha'éiti viable economicamente** (It's not economically viable).

The text explicitly states: ""Karai Costello he'i kuri upe energia nuclear jejapo oikoha ara viable economicamente, Australia oheka vaerã oipuru haguã."" This translates to: ""Mr. Costello said that nuclear energy production would be economically viable, Australia could afford it."" However, the following sentence contradicts this, stating:  ""Oiko porã ramo comercialmente, ñande jaguerekomante vaerã. Upeva hina, ndaipori ñembotove ñepyrũpy hina energia nuclearpe"" which translates to ""If it works well commercially, we will have it. Otherwise, we won't even consider nuclear energy in the future."" The initial statement implies that it *isn't* currently viable.

Option D directly reflects this economic viability argument. The other options are not mentioned or supported in the text.
"
Máva esquiadorpa oha'ã peteĩ sambyhaha pytyvõme?,"The correct answer is **A: Anna Jochemsen**.

The text states: ""Ijapytepekuéra oĩ Holanda, Anna Jochensen reheve omohu’ãvo porundyhápe kuñanguéra apytépe Super-G-pe..."" which translates to ""Second place is held by Anna Jochensen from the Netherlands, who won second place among women in Super-G...""
"
Mávapa omohu'ã porundyhápe Super-G kuñanguéra apytépe?,"The correct answer is **B: Holanda**.

The text states: ""Ijapytepekuéra oĩ Holanda, Anna Jochensen reheve omohu’ã porundyhápe kuñanguéra apytépe Super-G-pe..."" which translates to ""Second place was the Netherlands, with Anna Jochensen winning silver among women in Super-G...""
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ha’e hína ñe'ẽrei ko'ã apytépe Blake rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Oipuru pe palo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Blake avei oho condenado oñeha'ã haguére ombyai haguã tekojoja ñemboguata."" This translates to ""Blake was also convicted and sentenced to protect the home of a group of 30 people.""  ""Ombyai haguére"" means ""to protect.""  The passage also mentions he was protecting bottles being collected by a group of 30 people.
*  The question asks what Blake was condemned *to*.  The passage explicitly states he was condemned to ""protect the home of a group"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojepykuaava’ekue upépe (To be aware of it):** While he might be aware of the situation, this isn't what he was condemned *to*.
* **B: He'i oataka haguére (Having said he won't):** This refers to a statement he made, not his sentence.
* **D: Botella oñemombóva hese (The bottles being collected):** This describes *what* he was protecting, not *what* he was condemned *to do*.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba’e ñe’e Blake rehehua ha’e hína ñe'ẽrei ko'ã apytépe?","The correct answer is **A: Oho condenado oñeha'ã haguére ombyai hag̃ua tekojoja**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Blake avei oho condenado oñeha'ã haguére ombyai haguã tekojoja ñemboguata."" This translates to ""Blake was also convicted of damaging a home in a dispute.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojepykua (He'i ndoatakai hague ha he'i ha'e oipuru hague pe palo ojeprotege haguã umi botella gui...)** -  This refers to what Blake *said* in court, not a conviction.
* **C: Oñemombo hese palo (They are collecting those bottles)** - This describes the action Blake was trying to prevent, not a consequence of his actions.
* **D: ""Oje'e chupe """"""""casi inevitable"""""""" pe ijeho angairo pe"" (""It was told to him that the imprisonment was almost inevitable"")** - This refers to the judge's statement *about* Blake's likely sentence, not something Blake *did*.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **A**.



"
Mba'erãpa ndojeiporumõ'ái Tetãnguéra Ojoajúva viru ñongatupy?,"The correct answer is **A: Ñemitỹ juavyvarã (In a calm manner)**.

Here's why:

The text states the ""viru ñongatupy"" (compass) is made to be easily held and calibrated for accurate readings.  The text also mentions it's placed in a ""óga yjapyhy'ỹva"" (calm place).  Therefore, the compass needs to be used/calibrated in a calm manner to ensure accurate readings.  Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mba'aporekokuaa oñeipytyvõ hag̃ua tetã okakuaa'ívape okakuaa hag̃ua (To help the country achieve stability)** - While the compass *helps* the country, this isn't *how* it's used in the context of the passage.
* **C: Óga yjapyhy'ỹva (A calm place)** - This describes *where* the compass is placed for calibration, not *how* it's used.
* **D: Oñembosa'ive hag̃ua arapytu ñembyaku efecto (To create a weather effect)** - This is completely unrelated to the function of a compass.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e hi'ãnte Tetãnguéra Ojoajúvape oipysyrõ?","The correct answer is **A: Viru, oñemboja'ota rupi mba'aporekokuaa** (Arrow, it is used to help).

Here's why:

The text states: ""En Tetãnguéra Ojoajúvape omoñepyrũ peteĩ viru ñongatupy oipytyvõ hag̃ua tetãme ohasa asýva arapytu ñembyakúre ombohovake hag̃ua mba'e vai."" This translates to: ""In the Community Gardens, a small arrow is introduced to help the plants pass through the weeds to make them grow."" 

The sentence then goes on to explain *how* the arrow is made: ""Viru ikatu ojeipuru ojejapo hag̃ua óga yjapyhy'ỹva, y ojeipuru porãve hag̃ua ha ñemitỹ ojuavyvarã."" which means: ""The arrow is made by sharpening it, and it is properly placed and watered.""

The question asks what is introduced in the Community Gardens. The text directly says **""Viru""** is introduced.  While the arrow needs to be sharpened, properly placed, and watered, these are *details* of how the arrow is made, not what is introduced.



"
"Ko'ã apytépe, mba'épa Albert Muchanga nde'íri mba'e ne'irãva gueteri oñemoñeï?","The correct answer is **C: Mba'éichapa ñepyrũgua** (How to start).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ne´irã romoneĩ mba'éichatapa ñepyrũgua..."" which translates to ""We are going to propose *how to start*...""  Muchanga is outlining the plans for the initial steps of the AfCFTA implementation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Benin-pa oiketa AfCFTA-pe** (Benin is participating in AfCFTA) - While Benin is mentioned, it's not the primary point of Muchanga's statement. He's speaking about the process of starting.
* **B: Araka'épa ikatu ñemba'apo oñepyrũ** (When the work will start) - The text mentions a date (July 1, 2020), but Muchanga's initial statement is about *how* to start, not *when*.
* **D: Ñeme'ẽtava mbojojaha** (To impose tariffs) -  Muchanga mentions tariffs, but it's in the context of the *initial* steps and the framework, not the main point of his statement.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'érepa ikatu mba'apo oñepyrũ jasypokõipe?","The correct answer is **B: Marco ha concesión-kuéra oĩmbáma rupi.**

Here's why:

The text states: """"Ne´irã romoneĩ mba'éichatapa ñepyrũgua ha arancel oñeme'ẽtava mbojojaha, katu marco oĩmbáma romba'apo ñepyrũ haguã 1 jasypokõi 2020-pe.""""  This translates to: ""We are putting together what is needed and the tariff to be paid, but **a framework exists to work starting on July 1, 2020**.""

The framework (marco) is the foundation that allows the work to begin.  The text doesn't say Nigeria *wants* to start on a specific date (A), but rather the framework is ready *for* starting on that date.  The commission's approval (C) is implied but not explicitly stated as the reason for the start date.  Option D describes the process of preparing for the start, not the reason *why* the work will start on July 1st.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa The Atlanta Journal-Constitution oacusa tekombo’e mba’apohára rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Oñemoambuepahague Journal-Constitution marandu**.

The text states: ""Sa’imiupe rire, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution oikuaauka peteĩ marandu ohechaukáva oĩha apañuãi kuaara’ãme ojehupýtývape."" This translates to ""Afterward, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution revealed a report that there was a leak in the garbage bags.""

The question asks what The Atlanta Journal-Constitution accused the waste management worker of. The answer is that they revealed the report of the leak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndohekomba’e payhúi tavapýpe g̃uarã** (Not reporting garbage to the public): This is a description of the worker's actions, not an accusation made by the newspaper.
* **C: Ojuhuha apañuãi hyepýpe, katu ndoku’éi umi ojuhúva rovake** (They leak information, but those who leak don't come back): This describes the leak itself, not what the newspaper accused the worker of.
* **D: Omoarandu rupi kytakuéra ojehupytýva kuaara’ãme oguejyveha** (Informing the public about the waste management worker's actions): The newspaper *did* inform the public, but that's not the accusation itself. The accusation is related to the leak.



"
"Oñemopyendáva marandu ko maranduhaipe, mba'e noñemombe'úi Atlanta Journal-Constitution marandupe?","The correct answer is **A: Kytakuéra ojehupytýva kuaara’ãme ojupiveha.**

Here's why:

The question asks what the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report **didn't** mention. The passage states that the report focused on the fact that the water system operators were *leaving* their posts quickly and alerting the mayor to the problem. Options B, C, and D *were* mentioned in the passage. Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately reflects something the report *didn't* discuss.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa ojeikuaa oikorire bomba kapu?","The correct answer is **A: Mboýpa opyta herido (Number of injured)**.

The question asks what the information tells us about the bomb attack. The text explicitly states that there were 30 injured people. While it mentions fatalities (3), the primary focus of the information provided is the number of injuries. 

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Mba'e edificio yképepa okapu bomba-kuéra (What building the bombs hit):** The text mentions the government building but doesn't specify which part or the exact location within it.
* **C: Okapuvépa ra'e ambue bomba-kuéra (The timing of the other bombs):** While the text mentions other bombs in a government building two days later, the primary focus of the initial report is on the damage and casualties of the first bomb.
* **D: Mboy omanóvapa oĩ (Number of deaths):** While the text mentions 3 deaths, the information emphasizes injuries more directly.



"
Mboy partido-pa oha'ã Jesús oike rire Manchester City 2017-pe?,"The answer is **B: 21**.

The question asks *when* Jesús joined Manchester City. The text states: ""Jesús, 21 ary oguerekóva, ojoaju kuri Manchester City-pe ary 2017 jasyteĩramo club Brasil-gua Palmeiras-gui peteĩ tepy ojeikuaaukáva £ 27 millones rehe."" This translates to: ""Jesús, 21 years old, joined Manchester City in July 2017 from Brazilian club Palmeiras for a transfer worth £27 million.""

The options relate to different numbers:

*   24: Number of goals scored
*   21: Jesús's age when joining Manchester City
*   27: Transfer fee
*   53: Number of matches played

The question asks about the *date* of his arrival, and the text explicitly states he joined in July 2017. The age (21) is provided as context, and the other numbers refer to statistics or the transfer amount, not the date of joining. However, the question is poorly phrased; it asks ""Mboy partido-pa oha'ã Jesús oike rire Manchester City 2017-pe?"" which translates to ""In which match did Jesús arrive at Manchester City in 2017?"". There is no match number mentioned in the text, and the question is designed to be a trick. Therefore, the most logical answer is the number related to the date, which is 21 (his age).

**However**, the question is inherently flawed. It asks about a ""match number"" when the text doesn't mention a specific match. The best possible interpretation of the question is asking *when* he joined, and the text states he joined in *July* of 2017.  Since none of the options reflect this clearly, it is important to recognize the flaw in the question.

**Given the options, the answer that is most related to a timeframe is B: 21.** The flaw in the question and answer choices is that they are not related in a meaningful way.

**Final Answer: B**"
Mba'e club-pe pa Jesús oike £27 millones rehe?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City-pe**.

The text states: ""Jesús, 21 ary oguerekóva, ojoaju kuri Manchester City-pe..."" which translates to ""Jesús, 21 years old, is a player for Manchester City..."" and also mentions his transfer from Palmeiras.
"
Mávapa hína japur ko'ãva apytépe ñembohupaha huésped-kuéra rehe?,"The correct answer is **C: Huésped oúva táva marangatúpe hajj peregrinación ára oguahẽtavo.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the guests (huésped-kuéra) in the description.** The description states that ""Upe ñembohupaha huésped-kuéra hetave oĩ Emiratos Árabes Unidos retãygua"" (The guests in the accommodation are many from the United Arab Emirates).
* **Option C directly addresses who these guests are:** ""Huésped oúva táva marangatúpe hajj peregrinación ára oguahẽtavo"" (Guests who came from other countries on the day of the Hajj pilgrimage).  This aligns perfectly with the information given in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Huésped-kuéra oú La Meca-pe peregrinación árarã** (Guests came to Mecca for pilgrimage): This is true, but it's a general statement about *all* guests, not specifically what the text tells us about their origins.
* **B: Petetãteã huésped-kuéra ndaha'éi ko táva-gua** (Not all guests are from this country): While implied by the mention of many from the UAE, it's not as direct and specific as option C.
* **D: Upe ñembohupaha huésped-kuéra hetave oĩ táva marãngatupeguáva** (The guests in the accommodation are many from other countries): This is partially true, but option C provides a more specific and complete description of who these guests are (they came for the Hajj pilgrimage).



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ha’e hína añetegua?","The correct answer is **C: Huésped oúva táva marangatúpe hajj peregrinación ára oguahẽtavo**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the text *primarily* focuses on. The text emphasizes the large number of pilgrims **from all over the world** arriving in Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage and being hosted by the UAE. Option C directly reflects this core point: *pilgrims from all over the world arriving for the Hajj pilgrimage.*

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ndoikói mba'e vai (I don't know):** While acknowledging you don't know is okay, the question expects you to identify the main topic.
*   **B: Mayma huésped-kuéra ha'e Emiratos Árabes Unidos retãygua (Most guests are from the United Arab Emirates):** While the text *mentions* UAE hosts, it doesn't focus solely on *who hosts* the pilgrims. The focus is on *where the pilgrims come from.*
*   **D: Huésped-kuéra hetave oĩ Meca retãygua (Many guests are in Mecca):**  This is true, but the text isn't primarily focused on the *location* of the guests, but rather their *origin* and the pilgrimage event.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba’e marandu jechoka rehegua ndojeikuaaporãi?","The correct answer is **C: Mba'e efectopa ikatu jechoka oguereko ñande planetare.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the scientists are trying to understand ""mba'eichaitepa tuicha pe jechoka ha mba'e efectopa ikatu oguereko ñande planetare"" - how much the debris increases and what effect it has on our planet.  The other options are mentioned but not the central question being addressed in the passage.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa tekotevẽ gueteri ojeikuaa jechoka rehegui?","The correct answer is **B: Mba'eichaitépa ipya'e ojere hína ra'e satélite-kuéra jechoka jave.**

Here's why:

The text states that scientists are trying to understand ""mba'eichaitepa tuicha pe jechoka"" (how much the debris increases) and its effects on the planet.  This directly relates to *why* satellites are experiencing increased drag due to space debris.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mávapa o-seguíta desecho-kuéra (How the debris is tracked):** While tracking is important, the main focus of the scientists' study isn't on how the debris is tracked, but on *why* the drag is increasing.
* **C: Mba'éichapa pe resultado de análisis oñeguenohẽta (How the analysis results are published):** This is about the dissemination of information, not the core scientific question.
* **D: Mba'eichaitépa ituichakue upe jechoka (How the debris is getting bigger):** The text implies that the debris is getting bigger, but the main inquiry is the *increase in drag* due to the debris, not necessarily its size. The increase in size is likely a contributing factor to the drag.

Therefore, option B best reflects the central scientific question being addressed in the text.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e puesto-pa raka'e ohupyty Batten terarysýi Americano Ipirapire hetavéva apytéguipe?","The correct answer is **A: 400**.

The passage states: ""Batten ohupytýkuri 190° upe ary 2008 terarysýi 400 Americano Ipirapire hetavéva apytégui $2,3 su sua rupi.""

This translates to: ""Batten opens a store on the 400th of March 2008 at Americano Ipirapire street for $2.3.""

Therefore, the answer is 400."
Mávape Batten ome'ẽva’ekue peteĩ me'ẽrei?,"The correct answer is **D: Facultad de Artes ha Ciencias-kuérape** (In the Faculty of Arts and Sciences).

The text states: ""Ha'e ojerecivi kuri upe Facultad de Artes ha Cienciasgui..."" which translates to ""He graduated from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences..."".  Therefore, the answer is D.
"
Mba'epa ndaipóri pe léi oguenohẽva'ekue Motenondehára Arnold Schwarzenegger pa'ũme?,"The correct answer is **C: Ombotovéva ta'ãngamýi ñembosaraiha orekóva violencia umi tapicha menor-vape California okára**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what the law *does* according to the text.** The text states the law ""omotovéva ta'ãngamýi ñembosaraiha orekóva violencia umi tapicha menor-vape California-pe"" which translates to ""prohibits the use of violence against minors in California.""
* **Option A** is too general. It doesn't specify *what* the law does.
* **Option B** is a consequence of the law, not what the law *is*.
* **Option D** is also a consequence, not the definition of the law itself.
* **Option C** accurately reflects the core action of the law as described in the text.  It restates the law's primary function: prohibiting violence against minors in California. The ""okára"" (meaning ""in California"") is important because the law is specific to that state.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa nohendúi oje'eva'ekue?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The text states: ""Miller he'i kuri """"Mike heta oñe'ẽ kuri upe audienciape, che añembo sako'i hina kuri ha upevare nahendúi kuri ha'e he'i vaekue hina"""""" which translates to ""Miller said """"Mike talks a lot to the audience, I'm going to tell you and therefore I can't say what he's going to say""""""

Therefore, Miller is the one who couldn't say what Mike would say.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytégui ha’e añetegua Miller ohasava’ekuére audiencia-pe?","The correct answer is **B: Nohendúi kuri ha'e he'iva’ekue oñembosako'i hína rupi.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Miller he'i kuri """"Mike heta oñe'ẽ kuri upe audienciape, che añembo sako'i hina kuri ha upevare nahendúi kuri ha'e he'i vaekue hina"""""" which translates to ""Miller said """"Mike talks a lot to the audience, I admit it and therefore I don't know what he's saying."""""".

* **This directly indicates that Miller denies knowing what Duvall is saying.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dave oheja peteĩ jehecha tuicha Miller-pe** (Dave made a critical comment about Miller) - The text doesn't say Duvall made a critical comment; it says he made a comment and Miller responded.
* **C: Duvall mitãnguéra oñe'ẽterei audiencia jave** (Duvall's family spoke to the audience) - The text doesn't mention Duvall's family.
* **D: Ohendu porã hína kuri mba’épa Duvall omombe'úva’ekue** (He understood what Duvall was saying well) -  The text explicitly states Miller *doesn't* know what Duvall is saying.



Therefore, **B** is the only option that accurately reflects the information provided in the text."
"""Mávapa he'iva’ekue ojehecha jey hag̃ua pe """"Lei Pytu Potĩ""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Conservadores-kuéra**.

The text states: ""upe comite opavave partido kuera pegua ojehecha jey hag̃ua..."" which translates to ""a committee of the conservative party will review..."" Therefore, the conservatives are the ones who will review the ""Lei Pytu Potĩ"" (Big Wind Law).
"
Mávapa ombotove 'Lei Pytu Potĩ' ha'ehagui peteĩ ñemaniobra ñepyrũra upe elección ojejapotava rupi?,"The correct answer is **A: Tetã rekuái**.

The passage states: ""Upe Tetã rekuái Federal oike guive ocontrola haguã pirapire ñemoĩ Tasyo Mersey Devonport pegua, Tasmania, upe tetã rekuái ha ambue mburuvicha federal kuera okaguai kuri ko leire ha'e peteĩ ñemaniobra ñepyrũra upe eleccion federalpe ojejapotava hina Jasypateĩme.""

This translates to: ""The Federal State controls the import of ships at the Mersey Devonport port in Tasmania, this law is a preliminary maneuver for the federal election to be held in Jasypateĩme.""

Therefore, the law is being used as a preliminary maneuver by the **Federal State** for the upcoming election.



"
Mba'e ojapo compuesto-kuéra ácido cianúrico ha melanina-gua ojoaju rire mbarakaja týpe?,"The correct answer is **C: Cristal-kuéra**.

The text states: ""Mokõive compuesto ojoaju ojapo haguã cristal ohapembotykuaáva riñón rembiapo..."" which translates to ""Some compound forms a crystal that is useful for kidney function..."" and later ""...Mba'ekuaaharakuéra ohecha kuri cristal oikóva mbarakaja týpe oñembojoaju rupi melanina ha ácido cianúrico rehe."" which translates to ""Researchers see crystals formed by the combination of melanin and cyanuric acid.""

Therefore, the compound of cyanuric acid and melanin forms **crystals**.
"
Mba'érepa ohechava’ekue umi Mba'ekuaaharakuéra upe espectroscopía infrarroja?,"The correct answer is **C: Mymbakuéra hasyva'ekue**.

Here's why:

The text states that the crystals containing melanin and cyanuric acid are detected in **""ymbakuéra hasyva'ekue týpe oñembohovakéramo espectroscopía infrarroja rupive""** which translates to ""in the type of decaying/rotting materials through infrared spectroscopy.""  This directly links the use of FTIR to identifying decaying/rotting materials.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Riñón rembiapo (Kidney function):** While the text mentions that the crystals can interfere with kidney function, this isn't the reason they are *detected* using FTIR.
* **B: Cristal oikóva mbarakaja týpe (Type of crystal containing melanin):**  The crystal type itself isn't the reason for the detection method. It's the presence of the crystals *in decaying materials* that's important.
* **D: Mymba rembi'u ivaíva (Decaying material):** This is too broad. The FTIR isn't just identifying decaying materials in general; it's specifically identifying the presence of the melanin/cyanuric acid crystals *within* those materials.



"
"""Mávapa he'i Luna-re """"Mburuvicha tenonde Apýrape""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dramer he'i: """"Luna hína mburuvicha tenonde apýrape. Che gerente tenonde. Luna omano kuri mokõi jasy pyharépe. Peteĩvante ha'éicha. Kuña mbarete."""" This translates to ""Tommy Dramer said: """"Luna is the boss of the top. My manager is the boss. Luna died on the second day of the month. It was like that. A sunny day.""""

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer said Luna was ""the boss of the top.""
"
"""Máva he'i Luna-re """"iñambue"""" ha?""","The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text says: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels he'i kuri """" Luna iñambue va'ekue chéicha ikatu cherasa hína ahayhu ha ahechaga'úta chupe...hi'ã oĩ peteĩ tenda iporãvévape."""" This translates to: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels said """"Luna will be reborn, I will be a champion and I will avenge him...he will be in a beautiful heaven.""""

Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who said Luna will be ""iñambue"" (reborn). ""Iñambue"" in this context refers to Dustin Runnels' belief in Luna's rebirth and his vow to avenge him.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-seguidor kuéra (Followers):** While Luna likely had followers, Dustin Runnels is the one directly quoting about Luna's potential rebirth.
*   **C: Tekuái tapukuerekahára (The record keeper):** The record keeper is mentioned in the first sentence, but not in relation to Luna's ""iñambue"".
*   **D: Tommy Dreamer:** Tommy Dreamer is mentioned, but doesn't speak about Luna's rebirth.

Mba'épa ndojehúi upe mba'yrumýi mboguatahárape oĩva'ekue accidente-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Iñakã jeka vai** (He/She was seriously injured).

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Tape ojehuhaguépe accidente oñemboty sapy'a kuri emergencia kuave'ẽmby pytyvõhára oguenohẽ mboguatahárape Audi TT pytãvagui. Ñepyrũrã ojegueraha hospital James Paget-pe oĩva Great Yarmouth-pe. Upe rire oñembohasa kuri Hospital Adebrooke-pe oĩva Cambridge-pe."" This translates to ""Due to an accident, an emergency medical team took the injured person in an Audi TT. Initially, he/she was taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth. Afterwards, he/she was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.""

* The key phrase is ""Iñakã jeka vai,"" which means ""was seriously injured."" This directly answers the question of what happened to the injured person.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndojapói mba'eve tapicha óga ryepýpe oĩvare** (Nothing happened to the person in the house): This is completely unrelated to the accident described in the text.
* **C: Oñembohasa chupe hospital Cambridge-pegui ambue oĩva Great Yarmouth-pe** (He/She was transferred from Cambridge hospital to another one in Great Yarmouth): The text states the opposite; the person was *taken* to Great Yarmouth first, *then* transferred to Cambridge.
* **D: Emergencia kuave'ẽmby pytyvõhára oguenohẽ mboguatahárape pe mba'ygúgui** (The emergency medical team took the injured person in the car): While true, this describes the *action* taken, not what *happened* to the person as a result of the accident.

Mba'épa ndaha'éi kuri peteĩ mba’e oñembotuicháva Sudáfrica ñembosarái rehe upe torneo rugby-gua aja?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndaha'éi herrumbroso upe juego (It's not a close game)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jehecharamo jepe herrumbroso pe juego pe heindy yvy gotyo va kuéra ndive"" which translates to ""Although the game in the first half was not close between them."" Therefore, the opposite, that the game *was* herrumbroso (close) is the correct answer to the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñemba'apo porã angirũ kuéra ndive (Good start):**  The text mentions ""ñemba'apo porã angirũ kuéra ndive"" -  a good start.
* **B: Oguerekokuaa pe vakapipopo (They control the scrum):** The text mentions ""oguereko kuaa pe vakapi popo"" - they control the scrum.
* **D: Pe idefensa disciplinada (Disciplined defense):** The text mentions ""Pe idefensa disciplinado"" - a disciplined defense.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, araka'e oñepyrũ Sudáfrica oĩ porãve?","The correct answer is **A: Pe 10:00 rupi**.

The question asks when South Africa's game starts. The text states: ""Pe cabeza de serie Sudafrica oñepyrû porã kuri oĩ porãve rei ohasavo ohovo pe torneo. **Pe 10:00 rupi** oñepyrũ kuri..."". This translates to ""The series leader South Africa is doing well in reaching the tournament. **The game starts at 10:00**..."".

While options B, C, and D are true statements *about* South Africa's performance, they don't answer the question of *when* the game starts.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ndohechaukái China mercado-gui?","The correct answer is **A: China ñemureko okakuaa kuri umi ñemureko oñemoambue rire**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that China transitioned from a communist state to a state with a market economy, starting with Deng Xiaoping's reforms.
* The passage also mentions that China's economy has grown significantly in the last 90 years, with substantial exports to Germany and the US, and a growing GDP.
* Option A directly reflects the core idea of the passage: China's economic success is attributed to the implementation and expansion of its market economy reforms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: China ojapo mba'yrumýi expotación hetave Estados Unidos-gui:** While true (as mentioned in the passage), it's a *result* of the market reforms, not the underlying reason why China has achieved economic growth.
* **C: China PIB ikatu hína tuichave Estados Unidos mba'évagui:** This is a specific *outcome* of the market reforms. It doesn't explain *what* the reforms are.
* **D: China ndojapóiva hetave mba'yrumýi exportación Alemania-gui:** This is factually incorrect, as stated in the passage.  And even if true, it doesn't explain the overall economic growth.



Therefore, option A is the most comprehensive and accurate answer to the question of what allowed China to succeed in the market economy.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, araka'egui ikatu China PIB ohasa Estados Unidos mba'e?","The correct answer is **B: Mokõi década-pe** (Two decades).

The text explicitly states: ""China PIB ikatu hína tuichave Estados Unidos mba'évagui **mokõi década-pe**."" which translates to ""China's GDP became greater than that of the United States in **two decades**.""
"
Mba'e omokyre'ỹ Hu umi tetã kuera ojapo hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojapyhy hag̃ua jejapova ohasava idesarrollo-kuérape (They hinder the development of developing countries)**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""Hu omokyre'ỹ umi tetã kuera subdesarrolladope """"ojei haguã upe tape tujagui omongy'araẽvo ha uperire omopotĩ haguã"""".""  This translates to: ""Hu criticizes developing countries for 'using a short-sighted approach and further worsening the situation'.""  This directly points to the criticism that developing countries are hindering their own development.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojesareko economia rembiapo rapyta rehe (Regarding economic development):** While the discussion touches on economic development, it's not the *specific* criticism Hu makes.
* **C: Ohasa hag̃ua hikuái arigua-kuéra (Passing through other resources):**  The text doesn't mention resources.
* **D: Ojei hag̃ua upe tape tujagui omongy'araẽvo (Using a short-sighted approach):**  This is *part* of the reason for the criticism, but option A encapsulates the *overall* criticism more accurately.
"
Mba'e nomoĩri Hu?,"The correct answer is **A: Rembiapo rapyta rupive (Through economic development)**.

The text states: ""Hu omokyre'ỹ umi tetã kuera subdesarrolladope """"ojei haguã upe tape tujagui omongy'araẽvo ha uperire omopotĩ haguã""""."" This translates to ""Hu criticizes underdeveloped countries for 'using a small amount of energy and then increasing it'.""  Then, the text continues: ""Ha'e he'i avei """"ha'ekuera, uvei, ndojejopyi vaerã ojapyhy haguã pota'ỹme jejapova ohasava idesarrollo kuerape, arigua ha ikatupyry kuera"""".""  This means ""We, for our part, do not want to hinder the development of countries in poverty, with dignity and sustainability.""

Therefore, Hu's main point is that economic development is key to helping these countries, and they shouldn't be stopped from pursuing it.  Option A reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oñe'ẽ upe tape omongy'araẽvo rehe (About energy use)** - While energy use is mentioned, it's part of the larger point about development.
* **C: Araka'epa oñemboguejyta upe emisión dioxido carbono rehegua (The timing of carbon dioxide emission)** - The text doesn't discuss the timing of emissions.
* **D: Papaha upe emisión dioxido carbono-gua ñemboguejype (Criticizes carbon dioxide emission through its development)** -  While it mentions carbon emission reduction, the central argument is *not* about criticizing emission reduction directly, but about the importance of allowing developing countries to pursue economic development.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytépe rehe he'i Veerman ivaiha?,"The correct answer is **A: Pohãnohára Nahembe'ýiva**.

The text states: ""Richard Veerman, Pohãnohára Nahembe'ýiva... he'i..."" which means Richard Veerman (the President of Angola) said...  Therefore, Veerman is the one who expressed the sentiment.
"
"Juicio rupi, mávapa ombohekoviáta Huhne-pe Gabinete-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Huhne ohejarei kuri ha oñembohekoviáta Gabinete-pe Diputado Ed Davey rehe."" which translates to ""Huhne will be charged and will be prosecuted by Member of Parliament Ed Davey.""
"
Máva oñemohendáta Ñemureko motenondeháraramo Juicio rupi?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Oñeha'ãrõ avei diputado Norman Lamb toñemohenda Ñemureko motenondeháraramo tenda Davey ohejávape.""  This translates to ""Deputy Norman Lamb will also testify regarding the housing that Deputy Davey has been offered.""

Therefore, Norman Lamb is the one who will testify regarding the housing issue.
"
Mba'épa omongyre'ỹ umi artista ohechávape ojapo hag̃ua Camille Saint-Saens ópera jave?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojoaju hag̃ua hesekuéra ha opita cannabis**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the artists are looking at or doing when they perform Camille Saint-Saens' opera. The passage states: ""Umi artista opita porro de cannabis escenario-pe ha peteatro ijehegui omongyre’ỹ ohecháva guivépe ojoaju hag̃ua hesekuéra."" This translates to: ""The artists smoke cannabis on stage and in the theater, looking at them (presumably the audience or something related to the performance).""

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oho hag̃ua Japón-pe:**  The passage mentions Japan as something the artists are affected by, not a place they are going.
* **C: Ojupi hag̃ua hikuái escenario-pe:** The passage mentions they smoke cannabis on stage, but doesn't state they are drinking anything.
* **D: Hekovekuéra ombohape hag̃ua jehayhugui:** While the passage mentions drug use, it doesn't explicitly say they are *smoking* drugs to be affected by them.  It's implied, but the direct link to the visual aspect is with looking.



"
Mávapa añetehápe opita cannabis ópera jave?,"The correct answer is **C: Umi artista-kuéra**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *who* is smoking cannabis on stage. 
* The sentence says ""Umi artista opita porro de cannabis escenario-pe..."" which translates to ""The artists smoke cannabis on stage..."" 
* Therefore, ""Umi artista-kuéra"" (the artists) is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe artista** (The artist) - This is too singular; the sentence talks about multiple artists.
* **B: Umi ohecháva** (Those who perform) - While performers are involved, the sentence specifically identifies *artists* as those smoking.
* **D: Camille Saint-Saens** - The passage states that Saint-Saens is a composer, not an artist who smokes drugs on stage. It's a misrepresentation.



"
Mba’éichapa avei ojehero “espacio rehe jeguata” ojapóva’ekue Leonov?,"The correct answer is **C: Tembiapo extravehicular tripulada**.

The text explicitly states: ""18 jasyapy 1965-pe, oñemotenonde kuri tembiapo extraveicular tripulada (EVA), térã """"espacio rehe jeguata"""", oĩvo nave espacial okaháre hetave 12 aravo'ígui.""  This translates to: ""On July 18, 1965, he performed a manned extravehicular activity (EVA), also known as """"spacewalk"""", while the spacecraft was orbiting for over 12 days.""

While Apolo-Soyuz and ""Carrera espacial"" are mentioned later as a result of Leonov's actions, the direct answer to *how* he performed ""espacio rehe jeguata"" is ""tembiapo extravehicular tripulada.""
"
Leonov omoakã kuri sovietico-kuéra mba'e rembiapópe?,"The correct answer is **B: Apolo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Pa ary rire, omoakã kuri sovietico-kuéra vore Apolo-Soyuz rembiapópe oikuaaukáva carrera espacial opámaha."" which translates to ""A year later, the Soviets participated in the Apollo-Soyuz mission to observe the space race.""

The text states: ""Gibson ojegueraha tasyópe, ha katu omano uperiremínte. Omoakãva mba'yrumýi, oguerekóva 64 ary, noñehungái pe mba'e'andýime."" This translates to: ""Gibson was shot, and then died later. He was buried, having lived 64 years, in the cemetery.""

Therefore, Gibson is the one buried in the cemetery.
"
Mba'épa ojehu umi tapicha oĩva'ekue mba'e'andýime?,"The correct answer is **B: Peteĩ noñehungái, peteĩ omano**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Omoakãva mba'yrumýi, oguerekóva 64 ary, noñehungái pe mba'e'andýime."" This translates to ""The person who created the object, who lived for 64 years, died in the end.""  It also mentions the object's creation time and the saying associated with it.  The crucial information is that the creator *died*.  The phrase ""noñehungái pe mba'e'andýime"" (died in the end/in the end) is directly linked to the creator, implying their death. While the object is also mentioned, the question asks about *the people who are in the object*. Since the creator is specifically mentioned dying, and the object is created, the answer ""Peteĩ noñehungái, peteĩ omano"" (One dies, one is created) is the most accurate, even if it's not a perfect fit for the question.  Option A is too simplistic. Options C and D are not supported by the text.



"
Umi científico omba’apóva pe prográma-pe oha’ãro kuri ohecha umi efecto ojapóva mávapa koʼã mbaʼe apytégui?,"The correct answer is **A: Ambue pokopýva (Other cells)**.

The text states: ""Umi cientifico kuera omohu'ã kuri upe pokopýva hũva oafecta umi ambue pokopýva hũvape ojapoháicha avei ambue pokopýva.""  This translates to: ""The scientists explain that the affected cell affects other cells, as well as other cells.""  Therefore, the other cells are affected by the program's simulation.
"
Mba'éichagua jepokopyre omaña hína ra'e umi científico-kuéra?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagitario ha Kamby Rape rehe** (Regarding Sagittarius and Cancer).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Upe efecto oheka vaekue hina ko equipo ikatu oiko hina marejada rupive upe mbyja atýre pokopýva hũ ha upe Kamby Rape pokopýva hũ.""  This translates to: ""That effect affects this team because it's affected by the opposing zodiac sign Cancer and the opposing sign Sagittarius.""

The text further explains that they have ""mbarete"" (energy/force) relating to each other: ""Umi cientifico kuera omohu'ã kuri upe pokopýva hũva oafecta umi ambue pokopýva hũvape ojapoháicha avei ambue pokopýva. Ko kuaara'ã he'i aimete opavave jepokopýva hũva mbyja aty jerere oime hina umi mbyja aty jerere ha'eteva kora, ha ojeforma hina heta ku'i kueragui."" which translates to: ""The scientists explain that the opposing sign affects other signs as well, and vice versa. This research shows that the opposing signs of the zodiac are always in conflict, and many unforeseen situations arise.""

Therefore, the scientists are focusing on the interaction *between* Sagittarius and Cancer.

The passage states: ""Umi ñe'ẽreity Liberal kuera ojapova ñeha'ã ñemopu'ajevy haguã ojenfoca kuri umi contrato kuera oñeme'ẽva umi Washington peguape."" This translates to: ""Liberal commentators are focusing on the contracts they gave to Washington.""

The question asks why conservatives *don't* discuss something. The passage implies that conservatives are *not* focusing on the rescue and recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina (specifically mentioning the levee failure) and instead are focusing on the contracts.  Therefore, the answer is that they are choosing to focus on something else -  **sa'i ñeha'ã ñemopu'ajevy haguã** (a different topic of discussion).  Options A, C, and D describe the topic *being* discussed, not the reason for the lack of discussion by conservatives.



"
Máva oñe'ẽreity contrato-kuéra oñeme'ẽva rehe ñemopu'ã jevy hag̃ua Yvytupochy Katrina rire?,"The correct answer is **B: Liberal-kuéra**.

The question asks who is focusing on the contracts. The text states: ""Umi ñe'ẽreity Liberal kuera ojapova ñeha'ã ñemopu'ajevy haguã ojenfoca kuri umi contrato kuera oñeme'ẽva umi Washington peguape."" This translates to ""Liberal commentators are making a fuss, focusing on the contracts that they gave to Washington.""

This translates to: ""It travels a small, fast orbit through the upper part of California and then crosses the water from California to Oregon, and then through Nevada and Idaho to Utah.""  Therefore, Oregon is mentioned as a point along Stardust's trajectory.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e récord omohendáta ygarata?","The correct answer is **C: Ipya'evéva og̃uahẽjevy hag̃ua Yvyýpe (The fastest re-entry into Earth)**.

This translates to: ""Stardust broke a new record in all aspects for the fastest re-entry into Earth, achieving a record that was broken in 1969 with the Apollo X spacecraft.""

Options A, B, and D are mentioned in the text but are not the *record* Stardust broke.

This translates to: ""A driver Malar Balasubramanian, was stopped in Blue Ash, Ohio, about 15 miles up from Cincinnati, **in a car**, wearing a shirt and pants, and was taken away.""

Mba'e ojogua eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**. 

The question states that Upéva (presumably a company or entity) uses eBay to sell and offers video calls through Skype, as well as other platforms. 
"
Mba'épa eBay oheka ohupyty pe jejogua rire?,"The correct answer is **A: Oreko peteĩ viru ome'ẽva** (Receives a notification).

The text states that Upéva (presumably eBay) sends notifications when a seller has a sale. The other options are not mentioned in the provided text.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tatarendy pysyrõhára** (The first responder) - The text mentions the first responder helping, but it doesn't say they are the ones who don't speak when the fire department arrives.
* **C: Tahachi** (After that) - This is a time reference, not a person.
* **D: Pohanohára** (The volunteer) - The text mentions volunteers, but it doesn't say they are the ones who don't speak when the fire department arrives.

Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui amo ipahápe ojapo umi preso ojere hag̃ua pe ñorairõgui?,"The correct answer is **B: Tĩmbo ombohesaýva (Emergency call)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pyharekue 10:00-11:00 MDT aravópe, ka'irãigua omoñepyrũ tatarendy korapýpe. Pya'éko tahachi oguerekóva mba'erembipuru ñemosarambirã oike korapýpe ha omongora ka'irãiguápe oipurúvo **tĩmbo ombohesaýva**.""

This translates to: ""Between 10:00-11:00 MDT, the prisoners start to call the cell. Then, if there is an emergency, they use an **emergency call** to contact the cellmates.""

Therefore, the emergency call (tĩmbo ombohesaýva) is what the prisoners use to get help after being silenced.
"
"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei resa rupi, mba'égui Irán isãsova'erã?","The correct answer is **B: Islámico ñepu'ã**.

The text states: ""Tendota rusu upe tetãgua, Ayatolá Ali Khamenei, he'i itakyráre ñesãingo ha'eha """"peteĩ ñuhã"""" oñepyrũ va'ekue Irángua Islámico ñepu'ã mboyve 1979-me ha pe tetã isãsoha va'erã upévagui."" This translates to: ""The Russian representative of the country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that in his opinion, it is """"a milestone"""" that marked the beginning of the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979 and the country has since prospered because of it.""

Therefore, Khamenei believes the Islamic Revolution is what caused Iran to prosper.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa omonéĩ umi tapykuere orekóva virupurukuaa iraní rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Irán-gua apohare oñemomba'eguasúva (Iranian diplomats)**.

The text states: ""Umi temiandu, ta'ãngambyrýme osẽva, ha'e peteĩha jevy umi Irán-gua apohare oñemomba'eguasúva he'iha umi ñembohepy ohejaha tapykuere."" This translates to: ""The messages, transmitted in secret, are from the first group of Iranian diplomats who say the contacts offered by the intermediaries are...""

The question asks what is affected by the Iranian diplomats' revelations. Therefore, the Iranian diplomats are the most directly affected.
"
Máva ko'ã pa'ũme ndaha'éi Francia-pe jeporavo reko?,"The correct answer is **A: Mba'yrurã'i hesakã**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ary 1988 guive, mba'yrurã'i hesakãva'erã umi oiporavóva..."" which translates to ""Since 1988, the *candidates* have been disclosed...""  The question asks what *isn't* a characteristic of law regarding abortion in France.  The text focuses on the *candidates* being disclosed, not on the other options listed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oha'ãva jeporavorã ikatu omondo tapicha hérape:**  ""The candidates are called upon to respect all the freedoms."" This is a characteristic of the candidates.
* **C: Oñemboheraguapy jeporavo rysýi:** ""Abortion is *disclosed* as a right to freedom."" This is a description of the legal status of abortion.
* **D: Tapicha omondóva hérape umi oha'ãva oipapa voto-kuéra:** ""People who are called upon to respect the freedoms of the nation."" This is a description of the candidates.



Therefore, the only option that highlights a specific action *taking place* (the disclosure of candidates) and isn't a characteristic or description of the abortion law itself is ""Mba'yrurã'i hesakã"" (candidates disclosed).



"
Moõpa umi avakuéra oiporavo ha'ãhára?,"The correct answer is **A: Jeporavo rysýi-pe (In a prison cell)**.

The text states: ""umi oiporavóva oike ha'eño peteĩ koty'ípe, omoinge kuatia ojehechaukahápe ha'ãhára oiporavóva peteĩ hyrukuatiápe."" This translates to: ""those who are arrested are placed in a cell, with the person who arrested them having a prison cell.""  The subsequent text clarifies that prisoners are held in a separate cell and their possessions are searched. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that prisoners are arrested **in a prison cell**.
"
Mba'épa omomýi Allen-pe oheka hag̃ua Musashi-pe poapy ary pukukue?,"The correct answer is **B: Ohecharamo rupi mapeo mar ruguáre**.

Here's why:

The question asks *why* Allen went to Musashi after 3 years. The passage states: ""Ojejuhúva omohu’ã poapy ary Allen jeporeka Musashi rehe."" which translates to ""After 3 years, Allen went to Musashi."" 

Then, it follows up with the reason: ""Ohecharamo rupi mapeo mar ruguáre,"" meaning ""Because he saw a map of the island.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iviru tuicha rupi** (Because of a large number of people): The passage doesn't mention anything about a large number of people influencing Allen's decision.
*   **C: Oiporu rupi tuichakue iviru ojeporeka hag̃ua mar rehe** (Because he wanted to send a large number of divers to the island):  Allen *eventually* wanted to send divers, but the initial reason for going was seeing the map.
*   **D: Ohecharamo rupi ñorairõkuéra rembiasa** (Because of rumors/stories): The passage doesn't mention rumors or stories as the reason.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épe oiporu Allen iviru tuichakue?","The correct answer is **B: Ojeporeka hag̃ua mar rehe (To launch a rocket)**.

The text states: ""Vaicha, Allen, peteĩva umi tapicha iviru hetavéva yvy ape ári, oiporu tuichakue nunga iviru ojeporeka hag̃ua mar rehe..."" This translates to: ""The leader, Allen, one of the few people on Earth, sought to launch a rocket...""

Therefore, Allen's main goal is to launch a rocket.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva rupi oiko mba'e vai mba'ejapoha jerére?","The correct answer is **A: Uranio okaireíva (Radioactive Uranium)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the radioactive material causing the problem is ""uranio okaireíva"" (radioactive uranium).  The text then mentions that the authorities are concerned about people ingesting this uranium.
"
Mávapa ko'ãva pa'ũme ndoje'ekái umi yvypora oikóva mba'ejapoha ykére?,"The correct answer is **A: Ombogue hag̃ua pytu ñemohendapy**.

The text states that the authorities are ""ombogue hag̃ua pytu ñemohendapy,"" which translates to ""they are pumping water to cool the reactor.""  This is the action taken to prevent the spread of radioactive material. The other options describe actions taken *because* of the pumping, but not the primary response to prevent the spread.
"
"Dr. Moll rupive, mba'épa ombopy'apyve chupe XDR-TB rehe?","The correct answer is **D: Ojukakuaa hetaiterei tapichápe** (Spreads to many people).

The text explicitly states: """"ombopy'apy ha omoãngataiterei ojukahaguére hetaiterei tapichápe"""" which translates to ""spreads and is highly contagious, infecting many people.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ikatuha ojeipyhýi pe vícho tasyópe** (Can cause lung infection): While XDR-TB *can* cause lung infection, the key point Dr. Moll makes about its concerning nature is its ability to spread.
* **B: Variante imbareteterei pohã rovake** (Highly contagious drug-resistant strain): This is a description of XDR-TB, not what Dr. Moll emphasizes about it.
* **C: Mboy tapichápepa ikatu peteĩ hasýva ombohasy** (How many people a single infected person can infect):  This describes the *potential* spread, but the core concerning aspect, according to Dr. Moll, is that it spreads to *many* people.



"
Mboy hasýva oje'e ha'eha tasyo mba'apohára?,"The correct answer is **A: 10**.

The text states: ""Peteĩ arýpe, peteĩ tapicha ikatu ombohasy 10-15 tapicha ag̃uiguáme."" which translates to ""In one case, one person can infect 10-15 people."" Since the question asks for the number of people infected, and 10 is listed as an option, it's the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Mba'éichagua tembiporupa oiporu pe NextGen sistema?,"The correct answer is **A: Oñemopyendáva satélite-pe**.

The text states: ""Oipuru tembiporu pyahu oñemopyendáva satélite-pe..."" which translates to ""It uses a ground-based system that is transmitted to a satellite..."".  While the other options are related to the system's function, they are not *what* the system uses as a source of data.  The data is transmitted to a satellite.
"
Mba'erã oikovéta hina umi tráfico aéreo jesarekoharakuérape pe NextGen?,"The correct answer is **B: Ohecha pya’eve ha ome’ẽvo marandu porãve piloto-kuérape (Detects quickly and provides clear alerts to pilots)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that NextGen uses satellites and other sensors to ""ohejáva hag̃ua umi tráfico aéreo jesarekoharakuérape ohecha pya’eve ha ome’ẽvo marandu porãve piloto-kuérape"" - meaning it detects air traffic and provides clear alerts to pilots.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Tape mbykyvéva jeve (More efficient)** - While NextGen aims for efficiency, this isn't the specific action described in the text about air traffic.
* **C: Sa’ivéta carbono jepoi (Reduces carbon emissions)** - This is a *result* of NextGen, not its direct action on air traffic.
* **D: Sa'ive combustible (Saves fuel)** - Similar to C, this is a benefit of NextGen, not its primary function regarding air traffic control.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'ére ndokaguai marandekohaiha umi FBI-pe ojocentra haguére?","The correct answer is **B: Ocentra irecurso kuera umi caso ndahaýiva ojemuesakã rehe.**

Here's why:

The first paragraph of the text states: ""Marandekohaiha kuera okaguai kuri FBI politica tujare ocentra haguere irecurso kuera umi caso ndahaýiva ojemuesakã...""  This directly translates to: ""The initiative aims to center resources for cases that are difficult to solve...""

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the core purpose of the initiative as described in the text. The other options are either too general or not explicitly mentioned in the provided passage.
"
Mba'e iniciativa tie'ỹrehegua ojapoka FBI-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ojecentra hag̃ua umi caso ndahaýiva ojemuesakã**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Congreso oñepyrũ kuri ome'ẽ pira pire upe iniciativa tie'ỹrehegua ary fiscal 2005pe **ha ohai kuri upe FBI omoĩ vaerãha 10 tahachi kakuaa tie'ỹ reguape.**"" This translates to ""Congress initially allocated funds for this initiative in fiscal year 2005 **and authorized the FBI to deploy 10 additional agents.**""

The question asks what the initiative *does* for the FBI.  The key phrase is ""ojecentra hag̃ua umi caso ndahaýiva ojemuesakã,"" which means ""to concentrate on cases that are difficult to solve."" This directly describes the initiative's purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ocentrave hag̃ua recurso mba'yru ñemonda rehe** (To concentrate resources on investigations) - While this is *part* of what the initiative allows, it's not the *primary* purpose. The emphasis is on difficult cases.
* **B: Ombotuicha rembiapo porã papaha** (To improve efficiency) -  The passage doesn't explicitly state that the initiative aims to improve overall efficiency.
* **D: Tahachi oñeme'ẽva caso tie'ỹ rehe** (On the cases where agents are deployed) - This is a consequence of the initiative, not what the initiative *is*.



"
Mba'épa ojehu pe mba'yru rendy ombohováiva'ekue pe JAS 39C Gripen-pe? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ojetopeta** (It takes off).

The text states: ""Pe JAS 39C Gripen ojetopeta kuri..."" which translates to ""The JAS 39C Gripen takes off...""

The rest of the text describes the flight details, including the time and the pilot, and mentions a potential emergency, but the core action related to the question is that the plane takes off.
"
Mávagui oñemboty aeropuerto ojetopeta rire JAS 39C Gripe?,"The correct answer is **A: Vuelo ñemuhã reguape (Scheduled flights)**.

The text states: ""Pe piloto oñemopeteĩ kuri ha'eha Escuadron Mo'akãha Dolokrit Pattavee. Umi kuatia ñe'ẽ local kuera omomarandu peteĩ mba'yru rendy oñetumbava ombohovai jave oikova aeropuertope."" This translates to ""The pilot is Captain of Squadron Mo'akãha Dolokrit Pattavee. Local sources report a bomb threat, with scheduled flights being canceled.""

Therefore, the cancellation is specifically affecting scheduled flights.
"
Mávapepa Brzezinski oaconseha Iran Revolución jave?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter-pe**.

The text states: ""NSA pe, ha'e oipytyvõ Carter pe oñangarekovo upe tetãkuera moñondivepe..."" which translates to ""The NSA, he helped Carter in managing international relations..."" and then lists the events Brzezinski helped with, including the Iranian Revolution.
"
Mávapa ha’eva’ekue Consejero Seguridad Nacional 1977-peve?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter-pe**.

The text states: ""upei oservi Consejero Segurida Nacional pe (NSA) 1977 guive 1981 peve, Henry Kissinger rendaguepe. NSA pe, ha'e oipytyvõ Carter pe oñangarekovo upe tetãkuera moñondivepe..."" which translates to ""he served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, in the service of Henry Kissinger. As NSA, he helped Carter in international relations...""

Therefore, Brzezinski served as NSA *for* Carter.
"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndohechaukái hekopete Bobek rembiapo Partizan Belgrado ndive?,"The correct answer is **D: Oha'ã hetave partido mayma oha'ãvagui (He played many more matches than he scored).**

Here's why:

* **The text states he played 468 matches and scored 403 goals.** This means he played significantly *more* matches than he scored goals.
* **Option A** is incorrect because while he scored 403 goals, the text emphasizes the large *number of matches* he played.
* **Option B** is too general.  While he scored a lot, the key information is the disparity between games played and goals scored.
* **Option C** describes the transfer to Partizan, but not *why* he didn't score more goals at Bobek.

Therefore, the best answer is that he played a much larger number of games compared to the number of goals he scored for Bobek.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva pa'ũme ha’e añetegua Bobek rehe oha'ã aja Partizan-pe g̃uarã Belgrado-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Oñepyrũ oha'ã Partizan-pe 1945 guive** (He started playing for Partizan in 1945).

The text states: ""Ojeikuaaite kuri oha'ãramo guare Pertizan-pe belgrado-pe. Oĩ aja upépe, 1945-pe ha oi upépe 1958 peve."" (He played for Partizan in Belgrade. He was there from 1945 to 1958.)

Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately reflects when he started playing for Partizan.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épe Hesperonychus ojoavy Velociraptor-gui?","The correct answer is **B: Ipyapẽmbuku mokõiha ituichave**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ipyapẽmbuku mokõiha tuichavéraka'e, upévare ojehero Hesperonychus, he'iséva """"pyapẽmbuku kuarahy reike gotyogua"""".""  This translates to ""The second pair of claws is larger, therefore it is called Hesperonychus, meaning 'small, early raptor'.""

Therefore, Hesperonychus is distinguished from Velociraptor by having a larger second claw.
"
Pe he’iséva “Hesperonychus” ou hína mba'e característica física rehegua especie-gui?,"The correct answer is **C: Kupygui**.

The text states: ""Hesperonychus, he'iséva """"pyapẽmbuku kuarahy reike gotyogua"""""" which translates to ""Hesperonychus, meaning 'small, small, two-legged bird'"".  The key phrase is ""pyapẽmbuku"" which means ""two-legged"" or ""bipeds"". The question asks about a physical characteristic of the species, and ""kupygui"" (two-legged) accurately reflects that.
"
Máva ha'e añete jejapirehe guare?,"The correct answer is **B: Oĩ kuri po ojejukáva jejapípe (There is a gap in their relationship)**.

Here's why:

The question states that despite being together for 30 years, the couple hasn't been able to fully connect or understand each other. Option B directly addresses this lack of connection or understanding within their relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mokõivéva ména ha tembireko Texas-guare (They have a child and live in Texas):** While mentioned, having a child and living in Texas are facts about their life, not the core issue being asked about.
*   **C: Pe pareja omendava'ekue Buffalo-pe ojapo peteĩ ary (The couple spent a year in Buffalo):** This is a factual detail about their history, but doesn't explain the current problem.
*   **D: Jejapi oiko Buffalo-pe (They met in Buffalo):** This is also a factual detail about their history and doesn't address the main issue.



"
Mávapa he’i añetegua pe mba’e ojehúva upe jejapi?,"The correct answer is **A: Oiko peteĩ aniversario vy'ahápe Buffalo-pe**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Peteĩ aniversario oiko va'ekue oñembosako'i va'ekue peteĩ arange upe rire guarã, he'i kuri moakãharakuéra."" This translates to ""According to the grandparents, the anniversary was celebrated with a party.""
* Later, it mentions: ""Ména oguerekóva 30 ary, heñói va'ekue Buffalo-pe..."" meaning ""Having lived for 30 years, they moved to Buffalo...""
* The question asks what the passage says about the event (the anniversary). It clearly states the anniversary was celebrated in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oiko peteĩ ñembosako'ípe (It was a meeting/gathering):** While a party is a gathering, the passage specifically uses the word ""aniversario"" (anniversary), indicating it was a celebratory anniversary event.
* **C: Oiko peteĩ jevy'ahápe Texas-pe (It was a party in Texas):** The passage states they lived in Texas *before* moving to Buffalo for the anniversary.
* **D: Oiko peteĩ pareja omendahape (It was a couple's party):** The passage mentions a couple, but the focus is on the anniversary *event* itself, not just that it was for a couple.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa ojepy'apy ypyva'ekue umi funcionario-kuérape Luno rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Sa'i fertilizante carga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Barco oguerekóva 100 metro oho kuri ogueru fertilizante carga jepiverõguáicha y ñepyrũrã funcionario-kuéa okyhyje kuri buque oñohẽ mba'éramo peteĩ carga.""  This translates to: ""A 100-meter ship travels carrying fertilizer cargo, and initially officials are present when the ship receives a load.""

The question asks what is the concern for the officials on Luno. The text directly links the officials' presence to the fertilizer cargo.  The other options are not explicitly connected to the officials' role in the text.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ndaha'éi añete Luno ñemyaña rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Pe ñemyaña oiko ojehupi mboyve carga** (The pilot is positioned in the middle of the cargo).

Here's why:

The question asks what *doesn't* happen with Luno's piloting. Let's break down the information:

* **Luno pilots a combustible (fuel) barge.** This is stated at the beginning.
* **The barge has a capacity of 120 ha 160 metro cúbico rupi pype ha yvytu hatã ha ola-kuéra omyaña kuri rompeolas rehe.** (The barge has a capacity of 120 hectares 160 cubic meters and is protected by a wave breaker against wind and waves.) This describes the barge's capabilities and protection.
* **Helicopters carry two crew members and a small container.** This relates to helicopter operations.
* **A ship carrying 100 meters travels to deliver fertilizer and initially has officials on board to oversee the cargo.** This describes the ship's function and initial loading process.

Now let's analyze the options:

* **A: Pe ñemyaña oiko ojehupi mboyve carga** (The pilot is positioned in the middle of the cargo): The text **doesn't** state where the pilot is positioned relative to the cargo. It just says Luno pilots the barge.
* **B: Pe barco oreko kuri 100 metro combustible oikóvõguare ñemyaña** (The ship has 100 meters of fuel to help the pilot): The text mentions the ship carrying fuel *to deliver fertilizer*, but it doesn't connect this fuel to assisting Luno *in piloting*.
* **C: Pakõi tripante pa'ũgui, peteĩ oñehunga** (With a small crew of two, one is on the flight): This refers to the helicopter crew, not Luno's piloting.
* **D: Barco oñemyaña rompeolas rehe** (The ship is piloted by the wave breaker):  The text indicates the *barge* is protected by a wave breaker, not that it's *piloted* by it.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* directly supported or mentioned concerning Luno's piloting is option A.



"
Mba'e arykuéra-pe Argelia isãso?,"The correct answer is **A: Arykuéra 1940-pe**.

The text states: ""Arykuéra 1990 aja ou jey tetã isãso ramóva Argelia ombo'e hag̃ua cine ñemoakã."" This means he returned to Algeria in the 1990s to direct a film about the Algerian War. The Algerian War took place primarily in the 1950s and 1960s, but the conflict began in **1940** with the beginning of the Algerian War of Independence. Therefore, the answer is 1940.

While the provided options don't include 1940, the closest and most reasonable choice, given the context that the film was made in the 1990s *about* the war, is **A: Arykuéra 1940-pe**, as it's the starting point of the war.

However, it's important to note there's a discrepancy between the provided answer choices and the information in the text.
"
Moõpa ndaipóri raka'e ta'ãnga mbyry funeral ceremonia jehecha hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ambue tavakuéra Italia-pe** (Other people in Italy).

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Heta ta'anga mbyry kuera oñemoĩ kuri ambue tenda kuera pe Romape ikatu haguãicha ambue tapicha kuera ohecha upe ceremonia."" This translates to ""Many people set up other places in Rome so that other people could watch the ceremony as if they were there."" This implies that people across Italy (and beyond) watched the funeral in various locations *other* than the Plaza San Pedro.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Roma-me** (In Rome) - While some people in Rome attended the funeral, the question is about where those who *couldn't* attend the Plaza San Pedro watched it.
*   **C: Peteĩteĩ tenda Polonia-pe** (A place in Poland) - The passage mentions Poland as a place where similar setups occurred, but it doesn't say that it was the *only* place, nor does it state that this was the specific place to watch the ceremony.
*   **D: Plaza San Pedro-pe** (In Plaza San Pedro) - The question asks where people watched the funeral if they *couldn't* attend the Plaza San Pedro.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided."
Moõ oiko ra'e funeral ceremonia?,"The correct answer is **D: Tenonderã Roma-me ha upéi ambue táva Italia-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Heta ta'anga mbyry kuera oñemoĩ kuri ambue tenda kuera pe Romape ikatu haguãicha ambue tapicha kuera ohecha upe ceremonia. Heta ambue táva kuerape Italia pegua ha yvyapereguape avei, poravopyre Poloniape, ojejapo avei upeicha, he ojehecha vaekue heta papaha ava kuerare.""

This translates to: ""Many groups of people are gathered in various places in Rome so that other people can watch the ceremony. Many other homes in Italy and abroad, especially in Poland, also do the same, and many people watch the funeral.""

This indicates the funeral ceremony takes place in Rome (specifically, in various places in Rome, including Plaza San Pedro), and also in other homes in Italy and Poland. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that it takes place in Rome and then in other places in Italy. Option D best captures this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ambue tenda Roma-me** (In various places in Rome): While true, this doesn't mention the other locations where the ceremony is observed.
*   **B: Polonia-pe** (In Poland): True, but not the primary location of the ceremony itself.
*   **C: Plaza San Pedro-pe** (In Plaza San Pedro): This is *one* location, but the text mentions that the ceremony takes place in several places.



"
"Oiko rire pe jekapu, mávare oñeñangareko herida ivaietereíva rupi?","The correct answer is **A: Po tapicha rupi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndoje’éi oĩha herido ivaietereíva, katu po tapicha oĩva uperupi rehe oñeñangareko oñemondyivaieterei rupi."" This translates to: ""There were no injured, but a person who was there suffered from smoke inhalation."" 

Therefore, the person who suffered from smoke inhalation (the injury) was the person **who was in the apartment**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Avave (Nobody):** This is incorrect because the text explicitly mentions someone suffered from smoke inhalation.
*   **C: Peteĩ compañía de gas mba’apohára (A gas company employee):** The gas company employee *responded* to the situation but did not suffer the injury.
*   **D: Peteĩ vecino (A neighbor):** The neighbor *reported* the gas leak, but did not suffer the injury.



"
Máva ohenói fuga de gas rupi?,"The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ compañía de gas mba’apohára** (A gas company technician).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Peteĩ compañía de gas mba’apohára oguahẽ upépe peteĩ vecino ohenói rireoĩ rupi fuga de gas.""  This translates to ""A gas company technician went there and a neighbor noticed a gas leak.""

Therefore, the gas company technician is the one who *discovered* the gas leak, not *caused* it. The question asks *what* caused the gas leak, but the text only states that a neighbor *noticed* it. The technician's arrival is linked to the discovery of the leak, not its cause.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peteĩ vecino** (A neighbor): The neighbor *noticed* the leak, they didn't cause it.
*   **B: Apartamento-pe oikóva** (Someone in the apartment): The text mentions someone *felt* unwell, but doesn't say they caused the leak.
*   **D: Apartaménto-re oñangarekóva** (Someone in the apartment who was reacting): The person reacting is a consequence of the leak, not the cause.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mboy tapicha omano?","The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""Víctima omano Nicholas Alden, 25 ary, ha Zachary Cuddeback, 21 ary..."" which translates to ""Victims are Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old...""  It also says, ""...Edgar Veguilla oguereko herida ijyva ha hendyvápe..."" (Edgar Veguilla has a stab wound and a wound in his abdomen...). and ""...Kristoffer Schneider Katu oikotevẽ opytávo cirugía oemyatyrõ haguã."" (Kristoffer Schneider had to undergo surgery to remove a bone...).  This makes a total of 4 victims mentioned.
"
Máva mboka ndoikóiva’ekue sapy'ánte ataque aja?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka-gui**.

The text states: ""Uka mboka ndokói oha'ãsévo poha tapichápe."" This translates to ""This attack did not cause injury to anyone.""  The ""uka"" refers to the attack itself.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"
Mávapa ko'ã ñoa'ãrã apytépe ojeiporavo ojeipe'a hag̃ua programa Olímpico-gui?,"The correct answer is **C: Béisbol**.

The passage states: ""Béisbol ha softbol, ojeipe’a va’ekue Juegos Olímpicos ryepýgui 2005 arýpe."" This translates to ""Baseball and softball, are dropped from the Olympic program since 2005."" Therefore, baseball was the one removed from the Olympics.
"
Máva ko'ã ñoa'ãrã apytépe oiporavo Comité Olímpico Internacional oike jey hg̃ua?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby unión**.

The passage states: ""Rugby, rugby unión ja’eporãitesérõ g̃uarã, ha golf ojeiporavo po apytégui ojegueroike jey hag̃ua Juegos Olímpicos-pe."" This translates to: ""Rugby, rugby union are considered more suitable, and golf is included in the Olympic Games.""  The sentence goes on to mention other sports, but rugby union is specifically highlighted as being considered ""more suitable.""
"
Arthur Guinness omboheraguapy raka'e alquiler St. James's Gate Brewery g̃uarã mboy ary pukukuépa?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The question asks how many years after Arthur Guinness took out the lease on St. James's Gate Brewery it took for him to be able to charge 10 suo euro per year. The passage states he charged 10 suo euro *after* 250 years.
"
Mboy su sua dólar rupi omongu'e Guinness ary ha ary?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states: ""Guinness okakuaa oiko hag̃ua chugui peteĩ ñemuha yvytuichakue javeve omongu'éva 10 su sua euro (US$ 14,7 su sua) ary ñavõ."" This translates to: ""Guinness can pay a wind tax of 10 cents (US$ 14.7 cents) per barrel per year.""  The question asks for the cost in US dollars.

Therefore, the answer is 14.
"
Mboy tetã Unión Europa-pe ojehasa asy virus H5N1-rupive?,"The correct answer is **D: Poapy** (Four).

The text explicitly states: ""Francia hína tetã oĩva pokõihápe Unión Europea ryepýpe ohasa asýva ko virus reheve; Austria, Eslovenia, Bulgaria, Grecia ha Italia rapykuéri."" This translates to ""France is one of the few countries in the European Union affected by this virus; also Austria, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy.""  Therefore, there are four countries mentioned as being affected.
"
Moõpa ojetopa peteĩ caso ipahaitéva H5N1 virus rehegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Francia**.

The text explicitly states: ""...ombohasyhague peteĩ ype ka’aguy omanóvape, ojejuhu va’ekue arakõime peteĩ karuguápe **Lyon ypýpe, este gotyo Francia-pe**."" ( ""...resulting in the death of a bird, a case was detected in a farm near **Lyon, France** this year."")
"
Araka'épa Haiti oguereko paha mba'asy ojegueraha mboyve umi mbokárakuéra py'aguapy?,"The correct answer is **B: Umi mboka rehe oúva oguahẽ mboyve**.

The text states: ""Haiti ndoguerekói ve’ekue mba’eveichagua apañuai ko mba’esy rehegua siglo XIX guive. **Oguahẽ mboyve umi mboka rehe oúva**, Haití ndoguerekói ve’ekue mba’eveichagua apañuai ko mba’esy rehegua siglo XIX guive."" which translates to ""Haiti has not been able to overcome the consequences of these bacteria since the 19th century. **It has been contaminated by the waters**.""
"
Moõgua tembyre oipytyvõ ojegueraha hag̃ua mba'asy?,"The correct answer is **B: Naciones Unidas campamento jerere (United Nations camp sites)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pe demanda rupive, tembyre pe Naciones Unidas campamento pegua noñemopotĩri porã, ha upévare oike bacteria kuéra pe afluente Ysyry Artibonite pe, upea hina Haiti pegua tuichaveva.""

This translates to: ""Due to the demand, the sanitation in the United Nations camp sites was not adequately improved, and therefore bacteria entered the tributary of the Artibonite River, which greatly affected Haiti.""

Therefore, the failure to properly manage sanitation in the UN camp sites is directly linked to the spread of bacteria and the subsequent health crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ysyry Artibonite (Artibonite River):** The river was affected *because* of the bacteria, not the cause of the bacteria.
* **C: 2010-guare yvyryrýi (2010 earthquake):** The earthquake created the conditions, but the text focuses on the *sanitation failure* in the UN camps as the direct problem.
* **D: Pe Instituto de Justicia ha Democracia Haiti-gua (Haiti Institute of Justice and Democracy):** While they conducted a study, the text doesn't say they *prevented* the spread of bacteria; they just *studied* the issue.



"
Mba'e ojapose hína Irlanda retã rekuái?,"The correct answer is **B: Oguenohẽvo léi mbaretevéva droga ñemoneĩ rehe** (When a strong law is enacted regarding drug use).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko’ágã tuichaiterei mba’e, oñema’ẽvo hese tavaygua resairã ha justica penal-ramo, ko legislación toñemboajéma pya’eveháicha"" which translates to ""Because of this, when there's a concern for public safety and criminal justice, this legislation will be quickly enacted.""  The context revolves around a *law* being enacted to address the situation.

Option B directly reflects this. The other options are either too specific (condemning drug sentences) or too general (mentioning substances or drug use). The core of the paragraph is about the *enactment of a law*.



"
Mba'e oñemoneĩ sapy'ami Irlanda-pe?,"The correct answer is **D: Sustancia-kuéra (Substances)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ministro de Salud he’i ojepy’apyha tapichakuéra ñeimeporã rehe oaprovecha jave sapy’ami oñemoneĩ jave umi sustancia oñeñe’ẽha..."" which translates to ""The Minister of Health said to advise people to take advantage of the opportunity to avoid the introduction of substances...""

Therefore, the text is specifically discussing the prevention of the introduction of *substances* into Ireland.
"
Mba'ére oñeimo'ãva ojapoha pe mba'evai ojeheka?,"The correct answer is **A: Oga sururúre (In a haunted house)**.

The text states: ""Christopher Garcia, oñe'ẽva Tahachi Myakãha Los Ángeles-gua rérape, he'i pe kuimba'e oñeimo'ãva ojapoha pe mba'evai ojeheka **óga sururúre**, mba'e ñembyai rãngue.""

This translates to: ""Christopher Garcia, who lives in Tahachi, Los Angeles, says that the thing that is scary is to do something that is seen in a **haunted house**, anything scary.""

Therefore, the scary thing is happening *in a haunted house*.
"
"Ombojegua jave, mba'e ndojapói pe oñeimo'ãva ?","The correct answer is **A: Omoambue ñemoñe'ë**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pe haihechaukaha noñembyaíri teterehe; ñemoambue ojejapo ojeipurúvo ao anambusu hũ oñembojeguáva py'aguapy ha ñe'ã ra'ãnga ndive oñemoambue hag̃ua pe """"O"""" oñemoñe'ẽ hag̃ua """"e"""" michĩvéva rupi.""

This translates to: ""The speaker will imitate you; the imitation is made when, after your lips have opened, he attempts to imitate the 'O' by saying 'e' instead.""

Therefore, the action the speaker *imitates* is the *opening of the lips* to say ""O,"" and then incorrectly saying ""e.""  The core of what is imitated is the sound produced by opening the mouth. This is best captured by ""Omoambue ñemoñe'ë"" (imitate the speaking).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ombojegua py'aguapy ra'ãnga ndive (He creates a noise from you):** While there might be a sound, the passage doesn't focus on the noise itself, but the *attempted imitation of speech*.
* **C: Ombyai teterehe (He makes fun of you):** The passage doesn't explicitly say the imitation is meant to be mocking. It's presented as a simple act of imitation.
* **D: Oiporu ao anambusu (He offers you a biscuit):** This is completely unrelated to the passage.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ndoñembojái tutor Inglés-pegua Karno rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Oreko cita temimbo'e ndive (Lack of a citation from the original source)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the modern Jehekombo'e (likely referring to a religious authority) punishes those who introduce new ideas *without* a citation from a primary source. The text explicitly mentions this as a reason for punishment: ""Modern Jehekombo'e omboja kuri hese omoĩhague ñekuave'ẽ tuicháva mba'yrumýi rehe oñemboaje'ỹre chupe, he'ívo ha'eha tutor ha'evéva Inglés-pegua."" (Modern Jehekombo'e punishes those who introduce new ideas without citing them, saying he is the English tutor).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oreko cita temimbo'e ndive (Lack of a citation from the original source):** This is the correct answer, as explained above.
* **C: Omoĩhague ñekuave'ẽ oñemboaje'ỹre chupe (Introducing new ideas without citing them):** While this *is* punished, the text clarifies that the punishment is specifically because of the *lack of citation*, not just the introduction of new ideas in themselves.
* **D: Oiporu blasfemia mbo'esyrýpe (Speaking blasphemy):**  The text mentions speaking blasphemy as something punished, but it's not directly tied to the punishment of Karno specifically in the context of the question. The question is about *what* Karno is punished *for*, and the lack of a citation is the direct reason stated in the text for Karno's punishment.



Therefore, the most accurate and direct answer to the question is **A**.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapepa ndojapóiva rehenro Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **A: Turista-kuéra** (Tourists).

The text explicitly states: ""Rolando Mendoza ombokapu pe imetralla M16 **umi turistare**."" which translates to ""Rolando Mendoza shot the M16 **at the tourists**.""
"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, máva rehen-gui ndojepoiri?","The correct answer is **A: Turista-kuéra** (Tourists).

The text explicitly states: ""Rolando Mendoza ombokapu pe imetralla M16 umi turistare."" which translates to ""Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 at the tourists."" The rest of the text details the aftermath and the involvement of other groups, but the *initial* victims of the shooting were the tourists.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ombyaty hína teraguapy omoañetegua hag̃ua upe ñemenda meña ojeheguava rehe Brasil-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Ñe'ẽngurukuéra (Speech/Discourse)**.

The text states: ""Ava ñe'ẽnguru kuera oha'arõ hina ombyaty peteĩ jerurera 1,2 sua teraguapy kuera ogueraha haguã upe Congreso Tetãme Jasypateĩpe."" This translates to ""The speech/discourse that he gave caused a 1.2 million increase in the vote in the National Congress.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is mentioned as someone who might modify the legislation, but the main cause of the increase is not him.
*   **C: Tupão Católico Romano:** The Catholic Church is mentioned as historically influential, but not as the immediate cause of the vote increase.
*   **D: Marta Suplicy:** She is the author of the bill, but not the cause of the vote increase.

Therefore, the increase in the vote is attributed to the speech/discourse given in the National Congress.
"
Mávape ome'ẽta ñe'ẽngurukuéra pe jerurera?,"The correct answer is **C: Congreso Tetãgua Brasil pegua**.

The text states: ""Upe Congreso Tetãgua Brasil pegua odebati kuri ko ñemoañeteguaseva 10 ary kuerama..."" which translates to ""The Brazilian National Congress is debating this agreement for 10 years...""

Therefore, the Brazilian National Congress is the entity mentioned as providing the comments on the bill.
"
"Versace mombe'u rupive, mba'épa ojehu heta tapicha oñepyrũ mboyve ombohovái tiémpore?","The correct answer is **A: Ho'a amandau**.

The passage states: ""Okañy chegui che reindy ha iñirũ, che rapépe oĩ mokõi tapicha oguata’ỹva silla de ruedas-pe, tapichakuéra opoha omyañante chupekuéra” which translates to ""I felt ashamed and embarrassed, in my house there were two people sitting in wheelchairs, and people seemed to be looking at them.""  This indicates the reason for embarrassment and the reason people were looking was because of the **flood/storm (ho'a amandau)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Po aravo'i pe pantalla oĩ tarde (The sun came out late):**  While the passage mentions the sun being out after the storm, it's not the primary reason for Versace's embarrassment or the reason people were looking.
* **C: Yvytu hatã (Strong wind):** The strong wind is mentioned as part of the storm, but it's not the core issue.
* **D: Okañy chugui hogaygua (Ashamed of his own home):** Versace is ashamed of the situation *in* his home, specifically about the people in wheelchairs being looked at. The shame isn't directly about the home itself.



"
"Versace he'iháicha, araka'e oñepyrũ yvytu hatãvéva?","The correct answer is **B: Oky rire**.

The text states: ""Oky, hatã ha tuicha nde pire rehe ho'a ju ho'aramoguáicha..."" which translates to ""Then, with the wind and everything, it was as if you were being blown away...""  This indicates the wind started to pick up *after* the initial stage described.

Therefore, the wind started to pick up **after** the initial stage.
"
"Fred mboyve, mboy yvytupochy ojeregistrava'ekue 35° W kuarahy resẽ gotyo?","The answer is **C: Mokõi (Two)**.

The text states: ""Fred ha'e hina upe yvytu hatã imbareteveva ojeregistra va'ekue mombyry yvy gotyo ha kuarahy resẽ gotyo upe Atlantico-pe ojeipuru guive ta'ãnga satelite pegua **ha yvytu hatã tuichava mbohapyha ojeregistráva upe 35° W kuarahy resẽ gotyo.**""

This translates to: ""Fred is the wind that is most monitored by satellite, and the **third most monitored wind recorded at 35° W longitude** in the Atlantic.""

Therefore, the wind at 35°W longitude is the third most monitored.
"
"Fred oĩroguare Cabo Verde isla ykére, moõ gotyo oho hína ra'e?","The correct answer is **D: Yvate kuarahy reike gotyo (Upper level trough)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Fred is traveling *along* a trough (kuarahy reike) 645 miles (1040 km) from Cabo Verde. It also mentions he's a strong wind system and the third strongest recorded at that latitude (35°W).  The question asks how he travels *to* Cabo Verde. The trough is a weather pattern, a zone of low pressure.  Strong winds and weather systems move *with* and *along* troughs. Therefore, he is traveling along the trough.
"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ipya'eve henonderaẽvévagui?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

Here's why:

The question asks which standard offers the fastest data transfer rate among the options. The text states that 802.11n has a potential speed of 600Mbit/s, which is significantly faster than 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a.  Therefore, 802.11n is the standard with the fastest data transfer rate mentioned.
"
Mba'e oikotevẽ pe 802.11n compatible hag̃ua hapykue gotyo 802.11b ndive?,"The correct answer is **A: Pya'eveva'erã (Backward compatible)**.

Here's why:

* **802.11n is backward compatible:** This means that devices using older standards like 802.11b *can* still connect to an 802.11n network.  The 802.11n router supports the older protocols to allow those devices to connect, although they won't benefit from the faster speeds of 802.11n.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 802.11b oikova'erã 5,0Ghz-pe (802.11b operates on 5.0Ghz):** 802.11b operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency, not the 5 GHz frequency.
* **C: Ipya'evéva 600Mbit/s peve (It's 600Mbit/s):** While 600 Mbps is a key feature of 802.11n, it doesn't explain the compatibility issue.  The question is *how* 802.11n is compatible, not *what* it does.
* **D: Mokõi puhoe (Two frequencies):**  The fact that 802.11n can use two frequencies is a *feature*, but it doesn't directly answer the question of compatibility with 802.11b.



"
Mboy jeyta-pe pa pe medallista Olímpico-va oytava'erã ra'e Commonwealth ñembosaráipe?,"The correct answer is **B: Mbohapy** (Third).

The question asks *how many* medals the Olympic medalist won at the Commonwealth Games. The text states they won a gold medal in the 100m and 200m, and *three* bronze medals. Therefore, the answer is three.
"
Mba'ére pe medallista oro Olímpico-va ndo'úi pohã oikotevẽva?,"The correct answer is **C: Okyhyje ijestado físicore ojapo vairamo (He's worried that his physical condition will deteriorate)**.

Here's why:

* The text states the athlete won gold in the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, but he's worried about his physical condition deteriorating and affecting his performance in future competitions. This worry is the reason he isn't performing well.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndahasýi chupe mba'eve (He's worried about something)** - This is too general. While he's worried, the text specifies *what* he's worried about – his physical condition.
* **B: Ombohasy chupe (He's tired)** - The text doesn't mention tiredness. It focuses on the fear of physical decline.
* **D: Oñembotove rupi ñembosarái Commonwealth-pe (He's competing in the Commonwealth Games)** - This is incorrect. The question asks *why* he isn't performing well, and being in the Commonwealth Games isn't the reason. It's the concern about his physical condition affecting his performance.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'ére ikatu ra'e oĩ confusión yvy ryryi rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Arai hũ rupi (Due to the lack of information)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Arai hûva ndoguerekóiva mba'eve actividad volcanica ojehecha kuri pe yvyty ape."" This translates to ""Because there is no information about volcanic activity being observed in the area."" 
* The confusion arises because of the lack of data, not because of the map, the weather office reporting, or other volcanic areas.

Therefore, the lack of information is the direct cause of the confusion regarding the eruption.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, araka'e oikova’ekue pe cambio de fase?","The correct answer is **C: Jasyapy 10 pe**.

The text states: ""El yvyryryi tuichava oiko vaekue pe cambio de fase oiko kuri Jasyapy 10 pe yvate kuarahy reikevo pe volcan apýra caldera gotyo."" This translates to: ""The volcano initially experiences a phase change on July 10th in the early morning of the volcano's caldera.""

Therefore, the phase change occurred on July 10th.
"
Mávapa ko'ã mombe'u apytépe sonda Chandrayaan-1 rehegua ndaha'éi añetegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe orbitador opoiva'ekue sonda oreko tripulación** (The orbiter doesn't have a crewed probe).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Orbitador lunar no tripulado Chandrayaan-1..."" which translates to ""Unmanned lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1..."" This directly tells us it's an uncrewed mission.
* **Option A reflects this:** It accurately points out that the orbiter lacks a crewed probe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe sonda oraha instrumento científico** (The probe has scientific instruments) - The text explicitly states this: ""Mbohapy instrumento científico ogueraháva ykére..."" (Three scientific instruments are on board...).
* **C: Pe sonda jepoi oiko hekoitépe** (The probe landed on the moon) - The text says it impacted the lunar surface, but it doesn't say it landed. It did an impact experiment.
* **D: Pe sonda oñembosa’y opahenda rupi** (The probe studies everything) - The text says it studies all aspects, but it doesn't imply it studies *everything*. It focuses on specific aspects.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that is *not* contradicted by the provided text."
"Ko'ã apytégui, mávapa ohechaukahai porã pe sonda lunar?","The correct answer is **B: Oguejy hekoitépe** (It landed on the south pole).

The text explicitly states: ""...oguejyha hekoitépe jasy polo sur ypýpe"" which translates to ""...landed on the vicinity of the south pole.""  Option B accurately reflects this. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba'e ojeiporuta pahaitépe ojejoko hag̃ua mba'asy?","The correct answer is **A: Vícho jukaha (Tick)**.

The passage states: ""Mba'asy reñói omokyre'ỹ India sãmbyhyháme omohenda hag̃ua tapicha oitýva kure ñuhãme umi tendáre ivaivehápe, ome'ẽ hag̃ua heta su ñati'ũjokoha ha omotĩmbo hag̃ua vícho jukaha.""

This translates to: ""The tick, having been nourished by the Indian rat, attaches itself to the skin of an itchy person in rural areas, sucks a lot of their blood and transmits the tick.""

Therefore, the tick (vícho jukaha) is what transmits the disease.
"
Mba'éichapa oñembohasa ko mba'asy yvypórare?,"The correct answer is **B: Vícho jukaha (Tick)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mba'asy reñói omokyre'ỹ India sãmbyhyháme omohenda hag̃ua tapicha oitýva kure ñuhãme umi tendáre ivaivehápe, ome'ẽ hag̃ua heta su ñati'ũjokoha ha omotĩmbo hag̃ua **vícho jukaha**.""

This translates to: ""The disease is spread by the bite of an infected tick, which attaches itself to the skin of a person who has been bitten by a tick, transmits its saliva, and injects a tick larva.""

Therefore, the tick is the vector (carrier) of the disease to the human.
"
Mba'e ikatu oiko ñe'ẽsyry mokõiha fracaso rupi?,"The correct answer is **B: Tapicha imeña ojoeheguáva omenda hag̃ua oñondive ágã tenonderãve.**

The text states: ""Ñe'ẽsyry mokõiha fracaso, he'íva ombotoveha tapicha imeña ojoeheguáva omenda haguã oñondive ágã tenonderãve."" This translates to ""The second debate failed, because the petitioner demanded to be heard within three days.""

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the reason for the second debate's failure. The other options are related to the process but not the specific reason for the failure.
"
"Ko maranduha he’iháicha, araka'e oñembogue ra'e pe ñe'ẽsyry mokõiha?","The correct answer is **B: 2011-pe**.

The text states: ""Enmienda oje'éva omboajéma kuri mokõive cámara 2011-pe."" This translates to ""An amendment allowing the passage through both chambers was introduced in 2011.""  The second reading (ñe'ẽsyry mokõiha) happened within that same legislative session (sesión legislativa jave) in 2011. Therefore, the second reading occurred in 2011.
"
Mávape oñembotyky ra'e pe “Panama Papers”?,"The correct answer is **A: Firma Mossack Fonseca-pe**

The text states: ""“Panama Papers” ha'e hina peteĩ apy tuicha umi 10 sua rupi kuatia kuera upe Panama pegua firma tekopegua Mossack Fonseca..."" which translates to """"Panama Papers"" is a massive leak of 10,000 documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca...""

Therefore, the documents were leaked from the Mossack Fonseca law firm.
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávare he'i pe kuatia ñe'ẽ Inglaterra-pegua ocontrolaha empresa-kuéra pira pire?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Bank**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kuatía ñe'ẽ Inglaterra pegua he'i Deutsche Bank ocontrolaha 1/3 rupi umi 1200 empresa gua'u kuera ojeipuruva ojepapo haguã ko mba'e."" This translates to ""The article in the English newspaper says Deutsche Bank controls 1/3 of the 1200 companies involved in this.""
"
Mávapa ko'ãva accidente aéreo-kuérape oĩ hetave omanóva?,"The correct answer is **C: Avión ho'ava'ekue ohóva hína kuri Irán gotyo Armenia-guive**.

Here's why:

* The question asks about the number of fatalities in the air accidents.
* The text states: ""Jasy ohasa va’ekuépe, Irán ohecha desastre aéreo tuichavéva peteĩ avión de pasajero ohóva Armenia-pe ho’árõ guare, ojukávo 168 tapicha ohóva ipype."" (In the same week, Iran witnessed another air disaster when a passenger plane flying from Iran to Armenia crashed, killing 168 people on board.)
* Option C accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Avión ho'ava'ekue ohóva hina Armenia-pe Irán-guive:** While technically correct, it's not specific enough. Option C is more precise.
* **B: Accidente de helicóptero policía mba’éva:** The police helicopter accident resulted in injuries, not fatalities.
* **D: Avión ombetiva'ekue Mashhad-pe:**  The plane crash in Mashhad resulted in fatalities, but the question is asking about the *total* fatalities across *all* accidents, and option C refers to the largest loss of life.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ndaha'éi peteĩ mba’e mba'érepa oiko heta accidente aéreo Irán-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Sanción orekóva ndaikatui ojogua avión pyahu.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that international sanctions prevent Iran from acquiring new airplanes. This is a direct cause that contributes to the higher number of accidents.
* While the other options mention the Iranian fleet, they don't directly address the *reason* for the increased accidents.  The sanctions are the underlying factor limiting Iran's ability to maintain a safe and modern fleet.
"
Mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndaipóri kuri Irak Jetypekaha Aty marandupe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ñe'ẽreoity ko Ejecutivo politica ko'agãguare** (The Executive political speech).

Here's why:

The question asks what the Iraqi government's statement *doesn't* cover. The text states the statement focused on the Executive's political speech regarding Iraq, concerns about violence in Iraq, a diplomatic initiative to secure Iraq's borders, and communication with the US. Therefore, the statement *doesn't* cover the entire Executive political speech itself. Options B, C, and D are all explicitly mentioned as parts of the statement.
"
Mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndojejeruréi Irak Jetypekaha Aty marandupe?,"The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ garantía ojejoko hag̃ua violencia (A guarantee to prevent violence)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oje'epohýi kuri ndaiporiha avave ikatuva ome'ẽ garantia taha'e ha'eva ojejapova Irakpe ko'agã ojokotaha pehẽngue ñorairõ kuera, violencia jejupi tera ojesyry sarambi gotyo.""

This translates to: ""It was reported that a guarantee should not be given unless a solution is found in Iraq to prevent another conflict, where violence is unleashed.""

The report emphasizes the need for a *guarantee* to prevent violence as a key condition. Options B, C, and D describe actions that *might* be taken, but they are not the primary condition highlighted in the report. The guarantee is the core requirement mentioned.



"
"Tahachi he'ívare, mávava’ekue Provenzano jehecharamove?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text states: ""Tahachikuéra he'íkuri Lo Piccolo oguereko changui ha'égui Provenzano jehecharamove Palermo-pe..."" which translates to ""They say Lo Piccolo is Provenzano's right hand in Palermo...""

Therefore, the answer is Lo Piccolo.
"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba'ére omano Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Ojejuka Riina ñorairõme (He died in the aftermath of Riina's vendetta)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko'ã mburuvicha ojejopýkuri Provenzano-re ombopaharõ guare upe Riina ñorãirõ tetãete rovake oguerahava'ekue umi Mafia joasa rekove Giovanni Falcone ha Paolo Borsellino 1992-me"" which translates to: ""These bosses are accusing Provenzano of retaliating after Riina's death, and the Mafia, in revenge, killed Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.""

Therefore, Falcone died as a result of the Mafia's revenge following the death of Riina. Options B, C and D are incorrect because the text does not support these statements.
"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ndaha'éiva'ekue Hitoshi Saito apore?,"The correct answer is **C: Oguereko mokõi medalla olimpica itajúgui ojejapóva**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what Hitoshi Saito *did not* do.**
* The text explicitly states that Saito ""oguereko mokõi medalla olimpica itajúgui ojejapóva"" (won two Olympic medals).
* All the other options are things the text *does* say Saito did:
    * **A:** He was a two-time champion.
    * **B:** He was the President of the Japanese Judo Federation.
    * **D:** He was a Judoka (practitioner of Judo).

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* mentioned in the text as something Saito did is winning two Olympic medals."
Moõgui Iwasaki okañy ñemendagui?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepal**.

The text states: ""okañy kuri ñemendagui Nepal-pe"" which translates to ""he was arrested in Nepal"".
"
Mávapa oataca Iwasaki-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Pirata-kuéra**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""What attacked Iwasaki?"". The first sentence of the passage states: ""Pirata-kuéra omonda kuri chupe"" which translates to ""Pirates attacked him"". Therefore, the answer is pirates.
"
Araka'e omohu'ã Alonso pe carrera?,"The correct answer is **A: Schumacher rueda oñemoĩvai rupi**.

Here's why:

The question asks *why* Alonso had to retire from the race. The passage states: ""Michael Schumacher omohu’ã carrera Alonso rire, suspensión oñembyai rupi hatã oñorairõ rupi carrera aja.""  This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher caused Alonso to retire from the race, because the suspension broke during the race.""

Therefore, the reason Alonso had to retire was because of a broken wheel (rueda oñemoĩvai). The answer choice that best reflects this is option A.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fisichella ndaipu’akavéi rupi imba’yrumýi rehe:** This translates to ""Fisichella didn't participate in the race."" The passage is about Alonso, not Fisichella.
*   **C: Schumacher omopu'ã rupi carrera rire:** This translates to ""Schumacher won the race."" The passage states Schumacher *caused* Alonso's retirement, not that he won.
*   **D: Oĩ mboyve kuri tenondete:** This translates to ""There was something else.""  The passage specifies *what* caused Alonso to retire – a broken suspension.



"
Mba'ére Schumacher omopu'ã voi pe carrera?,"The correct answer is **D: Mba'yrumýi suspensión oñembyai rupi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher omohu’ã carrera Alonso rire, suspensión oñembyai rupi hatã oñorairõ rupi carrera aja."" This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher won the race when Alonso was leading, due to a suspension failure during the race.""

Therefore, the reason Schumacher won was because of a suspension failure that occurred during the race.
"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, máva rembiapo ha'e ñemonambi?","The correct answer is **A: Tahachi omonambi vaekue**.

The passage describes the process of releasing someone who has been detained for a certain period, specifically mentioning the ""tahachi omonambi vaekue"" (the one who is being released) needing to post a bond to be released 24 hours before their scheduled court date. The entire paragraph is about the release process for a detained person.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tekojojahára Glynn** (Judge Glynn): While Judge Glynn is mentioned, the passage focuses on the *action* being taken by the detainee to secure release, not the judge themselves.
* **C: Pe Central Booking instalacion** (The Central Booking installation): The Central Booking installation is where the person was initially detained, but the passage isn't primarily about the installation itself.
* **D: Ava corte-gua** (The court): The court is involved in the process, but the passage mainly focuses on the detainee's actions to secure release *before* the court date.



"
"Pe kuatia ipuku'ỹva rupive, mba'e oñemonambiva’ekue ikatu ojapo ojejoko hag̃ua 24 aravo rire?","The correct answer is **A: Fianza**.

The text states: ""Upe comisionado omoĩ fianza, oñeme'ẽro, ha omoĩ hekópe pe mombe'u ojapo vaekue tahachi omonambi vaekue."" This translates to: ""The commissioner provided a bond, after submitting it, and placed it as collateral for the promise to perform the scheduled booking.""  Therefore, the bond (fianza) is what is required for the 24-day booking.
"
"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, mba’e ndojeiporúi oñemyesakã hag̃ua mba’érepa ojehapejoko jeporavo jevy?","The correct answer is **A: Ñemongyhyje oguerúva (The resulting conflict)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lodin avei he'i umi tembiguái ohapejokoha jeporavo jevy ani hag̃ua umi Afganistán-gua oipuru iviru ha omboyke hag̃ua ñemongyhyje oguerúva ambue jeporavo.""  This translates to: ""Lodin also said that there are rumors about war being started because the people of Afghanistan are receiving weapons and fueling a resulting conflict with other weapons.""

* **The question asks:** ""Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, mba’e ndojeiporúi oñemyesakã hag̃ua mba’érepa ojehapejoko jeporavo?"" This translates to: ""Considering the things that have been said, what is not considered the reason for the war being started?""

* **The passage directly links the conflict (ñemongyhyje oguerúva) to the war's initiation.**  The other options are mentioned as potential aspects of the situation, but the passage clearly identifies the resulting conflict as the core issue.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Mba’érepiko ipahápe umi oñe’ẽkuaáva he’i ojehapejoko jeporavo jevy?,"The correct answer is **A: Tetã Kuatiaguasúpe imba’eavýkuri (In a country with a lot of problems)**.

The text states: ""Umi oñe'ẽkuaáva he'íkuri otopaha Afganistán kuatiaguasu imba'eavyha he'i hag̃ua jeporavo jevy noñeikotevẽiha."" This translates to: ""Those who speak say that Afghanistan is a country with a lot of problems, so it is not possible to have a revolution.""

Therefore, the reason people say a revolution isn't possible is because of the **problems in the country**.
"
Mávapiko ome’ẽ tekojoja kuave’ẽmby FATA-pe g̃uarã?,"The correct answer is **B: Umi agente político**.

The text states: ""Ko'ã agente poguýpe opyta tetã rekuái ha tekojoja kuave'ẽmby ñeme'ẽ ipyendáva Art. 247-pe Pakistán Léi Guasúpe."" This translates to: ""These political agents are given state authority and **emergency powers** as defined in Article 247 of the Pakistan Law.""

Therefore, the agents are the ones who are given the emergency powers (tekojoja kuave'ẽmby) in FATA.
"
Ko’ã apytépe mavaitéva mbohováipa umi agente político FATA-pegua rehegua ndaha’éi añetegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Ome’ẽ tekojoja kuave'ẽmby**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the political agents are sent to FATA to enforce laws and regulations (tekojoja kuave'ẽmby) as outlined in Article 247 of the Pakistani Law.
* Options B, C, and D are all things the passage *states* happen, but they aren't the *primary* reason the agents are sent.  The core purpose is to enforce the law, which includes applying regulations.

Therefore, ""Ome'ẽ tekojoja kuave'ẽmby"" (Enforcing regulations) best describes a key function of the political agents and a reason for their deployment.



"
Mba’e premio-pe oñembohérakuri Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Actriz iporãvéva (Best Actress)**.

The text states: ""Gosling ha Stone ojapyhy ñembohéra actor ha actriz porãvevape guara."" which translates to ""Gosling and Stone are nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress.""
"
Mba’e premio-pe oñembohérakuri pe ta’ãngamýi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ta’ãnga iporãvéva (Best Picture)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Gosling ha Stone ojapyhy ñembohéra actor ha actriz porãvevape guara. Ambue ñembohérakuerape oike hina Ta'anga Porãve..."" which translates to ""Gosling and Stone are nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress. In other categories, they are nominated for Best Picture...""
"
Ko’ãva apytégui mávapa oiko gueteri pe yvyryrýi rire?,"The correct answer is **A: Opavave reactor pe planta Shika Hokuriku-peguápe (The Shika Hokuriku plant's reactor)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the Hokuriku Electric Power Co. has stopped operations at the reactors 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant.
* The question asks *where* the power generation has stopped.
* Therefore, the correct answer is that the power generation has stopped at the Shika Hokuriku plant's reactor.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aeropuerto Ishikawa-pe (Ishikawa Airport)** - The text mentions the airport as being affected by the suspension, but it doesn't say power generation stopped there.
* **C: Opavave servicio ferroviario (Railway service)** - Similar to the airport, the railway service is affected, but the power generation isn't.
* **D: Peteĩ central eléctrica Niigata-pe (A power plant in Niigata)** - While the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant is in Niigata prefecture, the text explicitly states that the Shika plant's reactors are the ones that have stopped operations.



"
"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, ko’ãva apytégui mávapa oñembyai pe yvyryrýirupi?","The correct answer is **B: Mokõi reactor pe planta Shika-peguápe (Two reactors at the Shika plant)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Hokuriku Electric Power Co. is restarting reactors 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant.  This is a direct statement about the sources of electricity being generated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oĩmimi ogakuéra (There are them/they exist):** This is too general and doesn't specifically identify *what* is generating the electricity.
* **C: Oĩ tape oñembyaíva (There is a power line):** A power line is necessary for transmission, but it doesn't *generate* the electricity.
* **D: Noto aeropuerto (Noto Airport):** Noto Airport is mentioned as being affected by the power outages, but it's not a source of electricity itself.



Therefore, the most direct answer based on the provided text is that the electricity is being generated by the two reactors at the Shika plant."
"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, ko’ã tema apytégui mavaitéva noñemoĩri kuatiápe?","The correct answer is **A: Jerusalén renonderã (The status of Jerusalem)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks which topic is *not* mentioned in the text.** The text explicitly discusses:
    * The Israeli-Palestinian conflict
    * The 1967 borders and their impact
    * Israeli military presence in Palestinian territories
    * Discussions about borders

* **Jerusalem's status is a central and highly debated issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.** While the text mentions Jerusalem's importance, it *doesn't* delve into the complexities of its contested status as a holy city and a key point of contention.  It only mentions its location within the State of Israel.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **B: Ñorãirõ 1967-peguare mba’érepa oikoraka’e (Why the 1967 borders were established):** The text directly states that the 1967 borders were established after the Arab-Israeli war.
* **C: Umi militar ñeime ñúme (Israeli military presence in the territories):** The text mentions the Israeli military's presence and the Palestinian Authority's complaints about it.
* **D: Jeikovai frontera rehe (Discussions about borders):** The text explicitly states that discussions about borders are taking place, particularly regarding the 1967 borders.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**.



"
"Ko’ã apytégui, mávapa ndaha’éi Palestina mba’ejerure?","The correct answer is **A: Umi frontera oñemopyendáva umi condición ñorãirõ mboyveguare rehe.**

Here's why:

The question asks what is *not* mentioned as a Palestinian concern based on the text. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Umi frontera oñemopyendáva umi condición ñorãirõ mboyveguare rehe (The borders that were established under the conditions of the Six-Day War):** The text explicitly states that the borders were established after the 1967 war, which is a key concern for Palestinians in relation to their territorial claims.
*   **B: Militar-kuéra ñeime pe Jordán ñúme (Military forces are stationed in Jordan):** The text mentions that Israel withdrew its military from Jordan after 10 years of occupation. This is a point of contention for Palestinians.
*   **C: Mbohovái pe Jerusalén renonderã rehegua (The sovereignty of Jerusalem):** The text clearly mentions the dispute over Jerusalem, specifically regarding the eastern part being claimed by the Palestinian State.
*   **D: Militar-kuéra ñeime po ary pukukue pe Jordán ñúme (Military forces are stationed in Jordan after 10 years):** The text states Israel *withdrew* its military from Jordan after 10 years. This is the opposite of the statement in option D, and is a point of contention for Palestinians.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* mentioned as a Palestinian concern in the provided text is the establishment of borders under the conditions of the Six-Day War.



"

The text states: ""Ma ojetavy'o kuri Mbo'ehaguasu Nueva York ha Facultad de Derecho Harvard-peguápe ha peteĩ jey oguereko va'ekue upe """"green card"""" residencia permanente Estados Unidos pegua."" This translates to: ""Ma will study at Columbia University and Harvard Law School and then obtain a ""green card"" permanent residency in the United States.""
"
"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, mba’e tetã oipytyvõkuri Ma ogana hag̃ua jeporavópe?","The correct answer is **A: Estados Unidos America-gua (United States)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Heñói va'ekue Hong Kong-pe, Ma ojetavy'o kuri Mbo'ehaguasu Nueva York ha Facultad de Derecho Harvard-peguápe ha peteĩ jey oguereko va'ekue upe """"green card"""" residencia permanente Estados Unidos pegua."" 

This translates to: ""He went to Hong Kong, Ma is expected to study at Columbia University and Harvard Law School and then obtain a ""green card"" permanent residency in the United States.""

The text explicitly mentions the ""green card"" and studying in the US, indicating the US is the country helping Ma achieve his goals. The other options are mentioned as places he has been or might consider, but the primary country facilitating his plan is the US.

This directly answers the question about where Carolyn Wilson went.
"
"Hembývo irundy carrera opa hag̃ua ko temporada, máva oĩ irundyhápe ko Campeonato de Pilotos-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Hamlin**.

Here's why:

The question asks who is in third place in the Drivers' Championship *after* two races. The text states: ""Mbohapyhápe oĩ Hamlin veinte punto reheve tapykuévo..."" which translates to ""In third place is Hamlin with twenty points behind..."" This means Hamlin is currently in third place.
"
"Pe carrera oje’eva’ekue oikohague rire, mboy punto oguereko Kahne pe Campeonato de Pilotos-pe?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kahne ha Truex, Jr. Oĩ po ha poteĩhápe ojoapykuéri 2.220 ha 2.207 punto reheve."" This translates to ""Kahne and Truex, Jr. are in second and third place with 2220 and 2207 points respectively.""

The question asks if people see meteorites and find them originating from Mars. The text implies this possibility.
"
"Oñemombe’uháicha pe ehẽnguépe, mba’épa umi mba’e añeteguáva umi ita ojejuhuva’ekue rehegua oje’éva ouhague marte-gui?","The correct answer is **A: Opavavete umíva ojejuhuva’ekue upe lluvia de meteorito jasypokõime**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *why* the meteorites are said to come from Mars.
* The text states: ""Papo ko’ã ita apytégui oje’e ouhague lluvia de metorito jasypokõi ohasa va’ekuére guare apytépe."" (Talking about these stones, it is said that a meteor shower passes through the sky.)
* This implies that the reason they are *said* to come from Mars is because they are associated with a meteor shower.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oĩ 24.000 hesekuérava** (There are 24,000 of them): This is just a factual statement about the number of meteorites found, not a reason *why* they are thought to be Martian.
* **C: Oñemoñemu 11.000 dólares hepyve órogui** (They are valued at $11,000 per ounce): This is about the value of the meteorites, not their origin.
* **D: Oĩ 34 añónte** (They have existed for 34 years): This is a time frame, not an explanation for their Martian origin.



"
Araka’épiko oñemomombyryva’ekue Schumacher?,"The correct answer is **B: Osẽrire tenonde campeonato-pe pokõi jey** (He finished second in the championship).

The question asks *when* Schumacher finished second in the championship. The passage states: ""Schumacher, oñemomombyrýva 2006-pe osẽrire tenonde campeonato de Formula 1-pe pokõi jey..."" which translates to ""Schumacher, after finishing second in the Formula 1 championship in 2006...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñaccidenta rire Felipe Massa** (After Felipe Massa had an accident): This describes a consequence of a later event, not the event itself.
* **C: Omyengovia rire Felipe Massa-pe** (After defeating Felipe Massa):  This describes a result of the championship finish, not the event itself.
* **D: Opa rire pe temporada 2009** (Not in the 2009 season):  The passage actually mentions the 2009 season.



"
Araka’épa hasýva’ekue Massa?,"The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ Gran Premio aja** (During a Grand Prix).

The text explicitly states: ""Pe brasileño oinupã hatãiterei iñakã peteĩ accidente oiko va’ekue Gran Premio de Hungría-pe 2009 arýpe.""  This translates to ""The Brazilian suffered a serious injury after having an accident during the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009.""



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Osẽrire tenonde campeonato de Formula 1-pe** (When Schumacher won the championship):  While this is related to the context of the passage, it doesn't answer *when* Massa was injured.
* **C: Schumacher oñemomombyry mboyve** (Schumacher won the championship): Similar to B, this is context, not the answer to the question.
* **D: Temporada 2009 mboyve** (After the 2009 season): Massa's injury happened *during* the 2009 season, not after.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what the mentioned development means for AOL.** The initial paragraph states that AOL is a company that provides instant messaging and has a significant presence, similar to companies in the US.
* **Option B directly reflects this information.** It explicitly states that AOL is a company in the instant messaging market.  The development mentioned in the question (Yahoo! and Microsoft's developers potentially joining AOL) would strengthen AOL's position as a company in that market.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ikatuete ojupive AOL poruharakuéra retakue.** (It might cause AOL developers to leave) - This is a *possible* consequence, but not the primary meaning of the development for AOL.
* **C: Umi AOL poruhára retakue ombohováita umi Yahoo ha Microsoft puruhára** (AOL developers will replace Yahoo and Microsoft developers) - This is incorrect. The question states that Yahoo! and Microsoft developers *might join* AOL, not that AOL developers will replace them.
* **D: AOL ndojeiporuvéitama Estados Unidos-pe** (AOL is not established in the United States) - This contradicts the initial paragraph's statement about AOL having a significant presence, *similar to companies in the US*.



"
Mavaitévapa ko’ã apytégui ikatúne opa pe oñemohendáva hendaguépe pyahu rire?,"The correct answer is **A: Internet jeguerojeraguasu Estados Unidos-pe** (The internet is widespread in the United States).

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* the user likes the fact that AOL is being acquired, specifically the ability to access its services from anywhere.**  The core reason for this freedom is the widespread availability of the internet in the US.  Without the internet, remote access wouldn't be possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe mensajería instantánea mercado jeiporu (The instant messaging market is being acquired):**  While related, the acquisition of the market itself doesn't directly explain the user's ability to access the services remotely.
* **C: AOL sãso omongu'e ha omboheko hag̃ua mercado ha’e oipotahaichaite (AOL's acquisition and its availability for purchase):** This focuses on the acquisition itself, not the *reason* the user appreciates accessing services from anywhere.
* **D: Yahoo ha Microsoft joaju (Yahoo and Microsoft are competing):**  This refers to a competition between companies, and doesn't address the accessibility aspect.



Therefore, the availability of the internet in the US is the fundamental reason the user is pleased with the acquisition.



"

The text states: ""Upe mburuvicha oficina guive he'i kuri 19 ojedegrasia vaekue ha'eha tahachi."" which translates to ""The chief of the office said that 19 were injured.""  The question asks how many people died, and the text doesn't state anyone died. However, the options provided refer to injured people. So, we have to assume the question meant ""how many were injured?""

"
Mávapa odenunciakuri pe sospechoso del atake-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Mburuvicha oficina guive** (Chief of Office).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mburuvicha oficina guive he'i kuri 19 ojedegrasia vaekue ha'eha tahachi."" which translates to ""The chief of the office said that 19 people were injured and one was dead.""

Therefore, the chief of the office is the one who reported the casualties.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Florida ome'ẽ kuri 50 delegado Romney-pe..."" which translates to ""Florida will give 50 delegates to Romney..."".
* It also says that Florida is the state with the most delegates, making Romney the favorite.
* Option C accurately reflects this information - Florida awards 50 delegates to the winning candidate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 32 delegado estado-pegua (32 state delegates):** This is Newt Gingrich's percentage of the vote, not the number of delegates Florida awards.
* **B: Partido Republicano candidatura (Republican candidacy):** This is a general term for the race, not the specific number of delegates Florida awards.
* **D: 46% umi oiporavóva chupe (46% of those who voted for him):** This is Romney's percentage of the vote in Florida, not the number of delegates the state awards.

The question asks what percentage of the vote Newt Gingrich received. The text explicitly states: ""Representante-kuéra Cámara Estados Unidos-gua, Newt Gingrich, opyta kuri tenda mokõihápe 32% oiporavóva chupe."" This translates to ""Representative of the United States House, Newt Gingrich, is in second place with 32% of the vote.""

This translates to ""Perry said 'We will continue to be in Texas to be able to participate in the caucus in this state, I want to see what chance I have to further this career.'""  This implies Perry is concerned about his chances *in* the race to win the caucus. The question asks what would happen *if* he wasn't in the race to win the caucus.  The answer to that implication is Perry would be negatively impacted as he views the caucus as a crucial step in his career advancement.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gingrich:** The text suggests Gingrich is actively campaigning and making announcements, implying he *is* in the race.
* **B: Bachmann:** The text states Bachmann is considering a campaign but has not committed. She is not described as being actively in the race.
* **D: Romney:** Romney is only mentioned as a recipient of campaign ads from Gingrich. The text doesn't indicate Romney is directly affected by Perry potentially not being in the race.

"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, mávapa oñe’ẽ porãiterei ambue candidato rehe osẽ rire ojehupytýva caucus-pe?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oguahẽ rire ojehupytýva, Gingrich oguerohory Santorum-pe, katu iñe’ẽpohýi Romney-pe..."". This translates to ""After the caucus, Gingrich attacked Santorum, but spoke vaguely about Romney..."". This indicates Gingrich was the candidate who spoke about the others.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bachmann:** The text says Bachmann is ""osẽ tenondevéva Ames Straw Poll-pe jasypoapy ramo, he’i campaña omboguatáva oguahẽmaha hu’ãme."" meaning Bachmann is not well-positioned.
* **C: Romney:** The text says Gingrich spoke *about* Romney, not the other way around.

Pe puhoemosarambiha he'i upe hechaukapy ha'éva omombe'úvo oguerekoha peteĩ mba'ekuaaiterei jere?,"The correct answer is **B: Mba'ekuaaiterei**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the radio program *says* about the artifact. The text states: """"ymaguare puhoe ñoha'ãnga oguerekóva peteĩ mba'ekuaaiterei jere ipyahu ha itapiagua'ỹva!"""" This translates to: """"A strange object that has been discovered which is an artifact of immense value!""""

Therefore, the program says the artifact is an **artifact** (mba'ekuaaiterei).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amateur:** This describes the people who operate the radio program, not what the program says about the artifact itself.
*   **C: Ymaguare:** This means ""strange"" or ""weird,"" which is a description of the object but not what the program *says* the object is.
*   **D: Upe gotyogua:** This means ""that small town,"" which refers to the location of the amateur radio operators, not what the program says about the artifact.

The question asks *what* David Headley's report says he helped with. The report says he helped with the escape of the terrorists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umi granada (The grenades)** - The grenades were used *in* the attack, not what Headley helped with.
*   **C: Tapichakuéra mbokareheve (The escape of the people)** - This is what Headley helped facilitate, but the question asks what *his report* says.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raonic ohupytýkuri 88% umi punto neto-gui** - This is true, but it doesn't directly answer the question of *who won*.
* **C: Nadal ogana Raonic-pe** - This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **D: Raonic ojapo 76 punto** - This is a detail about points Raonic made, not who won the match.

Therefore, the question asks for the statement that describes the result of the Brisbane Open match, and that result is that Raonic won.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’éichapa oñemohendákuri partido Nadal ha Raonic oha’ãva pe servicio peteĩha rire?","The correct answer is **A: Raonic ombovosa kuri 88% umi punto neto-gui**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nadal ombovosa kuri 88% umi punto netogui upe partidope ogana kuevo 76 punto upe servicio peteĩhape.""  This translates to: ""Nadal won 88% of the net points in the match, gaining 76 points on his first serve.""

Therefore, Raonic won 88% of the net points.

Mba’e programa ñe’ẽ rehegua ndoikéi umi mbohapy Naked News transmisión pyahúpe?,"The correct answer is **A: Italiano**.

The text states that Naked News broadcasts in English, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, and Korean.  The question asks which language is *not* mentioned as being broadcast. The text specifically lists Italian as one of the languages they *do* use, but the question asks which language is *not* used.  Therefore, the answer is Italiano.

Let me rephrase to be clearer about why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Coreano:** The text explicitly states they broadcast in Korean.
* **C: Japonés:** The text explicitly states they broadcast in Japanese.
* **D: Español:** The text explicitly states they broadcast in Spanish.



"
"Pe pehẽngue heʼiháicha, moõpa ndojeguerekomo'ãi umi transmisión pyahu Naked News?","The correct answer is **B: Internet**.

The text states: ""Yvy'ape'áripegua atyguasu, oporomarandúmava inglés ha japonés-pe, omyasãima apopyrã español, italiano ha coreano ta'ãngambyry, **internet ha tembiporumỹime g̃uarã**.""  This translates to ""Globally, with a team that translates into English and Japanese, it offers translations into Spanish, Italian and Korean, **through the internet and telecommunications**.""

Therefore, the naked news broadcasts are accessed via the internet.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what the text *shows* about the results of the races.**
* The text explicitly states: ""Mokõiha carrera-pe, Carpanedo omohu'ã peteĩ esquiador Hungria-gua mboyve"" (In the second race, Carpanedo beat a skier from Hungary). This is a direct result presented in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 45 esquiador nomohu'ãi icarrera Slalom Guasúpe (45 skiers did not qualify for the Super Slalom race):**  While this is true, the text focuses on the results of *those who did qualify*, not those who didn't. The question is about what the text *shows* about the results, and the qualification number is secondary.
* **C: Hetave esquiador omohu'ãva Slalom Guasu Slalom-gui (Another skier didn't qualify from Super Slalom):** This is a bit confusing and not directly supported. The text says 45 skiers didn't qualify, but it doesn't say *another* skier specifically.
* **D: Carpenado opyta pa tendápe Slalom-pe (Carpanedo fell on the Slalom run):** The text says Carpanedo *beat* a skier, implying success, not falling."
Mávapa ko'ãva apytégui odecidi NBA ojejoko hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **C: Oimeraẽva ha’ãhára osẽva chupe positivo COVID-19 rehegua**.

Here's why:

The question asks *what* decided the NBA's pause. The provided text states the NBA paused *because* a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19. Therefore, the player testing positive is the direct cause.
"
"Pe pehẽngue heʼiháicha, mba'érepa NBA oñepyrũ ojepy'apy virus rehe?","The correct answer is **D: Peteĩ ha’ãhára Utah Jazz-gua osẽkuri chupe positivo.**

Here's why:

* The question asks *why* the NBA started addressing the virus.
* The initial statement says the NBA started addressing it because a Utah Jazz player tested positive.
* Option D directly reflects this initial statement.

The other options are too broad or don't specifically relate to the immediate reason the NBA started taking action. While options B and C are related (multiple positives), the trigger was the initial positive test of the Utah Jazz player.
"
Mávapa omoingera’e gol motenondeha partidope Washington Capitals ohugava’ekue Atlanta Thrashers ndive?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Oveschkin asistencia peteĩha ko pyharepe ha'e kuri upe gol motenondeha partidope ojapo vaekue puahu Nicklas Backstrom..."" which translates to ""Oveschkin's first assist in this game was for the opening goal scored by Nicklas Backstrom...""
"
Mávapa omoinge gol 60ha peteĩ ára vorépe partido Capitals ohugava’ekue Thrashers ndivépe?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text explicitly states: ""igol mokõiha upe pyharépe ha'ékuri 60-ha upe ára vorépe, ha oiko chugui jugador peteĩha omoingéva 60 térã hetave gol peteĩ ára vorépe 1995-96 guive, uperõ Jaromir Jagr ha Mario Lemieux ambue ohupytýkuri ko tu'ã.""

The text states: ""Northern Rock ojerure kuri ñepytyvõ oñe’ẽvo crisis de las hipotecas de alto riesgo aja 2007 arýpe."" (Northern Rock claimed to need help when the high-risk mortgage crisis arose in 2007.)

While the other options are related events, the crisis is the *reason* Northern Rock needed assistance from the government.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa pe ñe’ẽasãi omombe'u porãvéva mba’eichaitépara’e pe trato ojapóva Virgin Group banco Northern Rock ndive?","The correct answer is **A: Virgin Group ojogua avei empresa orekóva gestión activa Northern Rock mba’évakuri** (Virgin Group also spun off a company with active management from Northern Rock).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Virgin ojogua pe Northern Rock “banco porã” añónte, ha ndojoguáipeempresa orekóva gestión activa."" (Virgin spun off the ""good bank"" Northern Rock in 2012, and kept the company with active management.)
* Option A accurately reflects this action.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * B is too general; it doesn't specify *what* Virgin did beyond spinning off a company.
    * C is incorrect; the text says Virgin *spun off* a company, not that they were embarrassed.
    * D is also too general; it doesn't pinpoint the specific action of spinning off a management company.

This translates to: ""When Prime Minister Rudd advocated for the Kyoto Protocol, he did so in the United States, and it was the country that did not sign the agreement.""

Therefore, the United States is the country affected by the Kyoto Protocol's language because it didn't sign it.
"
Australia-gua Sãmbyhyhakue oimo'ã pe ratificación Kioto-pegua ombyaineha  mba'épe?,"The correct answer is **C: Tatapỹirã guerahaukáre (In the event of emissions reduction)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Australia *didn't* ratify the Kyoto Protocol because it believed it would negatively impact its economy due to the need to reduce emissions.  This directly links the reason for non-ratification to the impact on emissions reduction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Estados Unidos-pe (In the United States):**  The text mentions Rudd speaking *about* the Kyoto Protocol in the US, but it doesn't say Australia didn't ratify *because* of the US.
* **B: Tetã virupurukuaa (Developed countries):** While developed countries were the main focus of the Kyoto Protocol, the text doesn't specifically state this was the *reason* Australia didn't ratify.
* **D: Tetã ñemyasãi jehupytyrã (Developing countries):** The text mentions India and China didn't have a binding commitment, but this isn't presented as the primary reason for Australia's non-ratification.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is C.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Australia-gua tirador ñoa'ãngatupegua caza apopyrãmegua Ogueru kuri pytyvõhára oikoitéva..."". This translates to ""The Australian Shooting Squad is offering assistance..."". The passage is about the Australian Shooting Squad helping with wildlife management.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pe Apopyrã Australia-gua tirador ñoa'ãngatupegua:** This is too broad. It describes the organization, not the specific group being informed.
*   **B: Pe Apopyrã Conservación ha Parque-kuéra Patrimonio rehegua:** While NPWS is related to conservation and parks, the text focuses on the *shooting squad* and their work.
*   **C: Pe Apopyrã NPWS rehegua:** NPWS (New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service) is involved, but the primary focus is the Australian Shooting Squad's involvement.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...guardabosque-kuéra ojejesareko va'erã aguĩ guive, ha upe oñeñangareko kuri upe tembiapo rehe ha ojehecha oiko porãpa."" ( ... rangers are being trained to identify and assess the extent of the infestation...).  This directly implies that **the first step is to identify and assess the infestation**, which is what option A describes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi tirador-pe oñemomarandu kuri jehekombo’e rehe** (The hunters are being informed of your contact details) - This is a consequence of the infestation being identified and assessed, not the initial step.
* **C: Umi tirador rehe ojesarekókuri guardabosque-kuéra** (Rangers are being trained with the hunters) - This describes the training process itself, not the initial identification.
* **D: Ojeporavo irundy tirador** (Two hunters are being deployed) -  This is a possible action *after* the infestation has been identified, but not the initial step.

This translates to: ""After examining this fossil, it is known that the division occurred with a lot of molecular evidence that said it was splitting. “That is everything that is being separated”, said Berhane Asfaw, a researcher and worker at Rift Valley Research Service in Ethiopia.""

The text directly links the division to the Rift Valley. The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Peteĩ fósil-pe** - The fossil provides evidence *of* the division, but the division itself happened in the Rift Valley.
*   **C: Pe evidencia molecular-pe** - Molecular evidence *suggests* the division, but doesn't *define* where it happened.
*   **D: Etiopía-pe** - Ethiopia is where the research service is located, not necessarily where the division occurred.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Upéva he’ise opa mba’e oñembojevy jey va’erãha"" which translates to ""That [molecular evidence] says everything is being challenged."" 
* **The question asks:** ""mbaʼépa oikoma ymaiterei?"" (what is being challenged?)
* **The answer clearly points to the interpretation/conclusion drawn *from* the molecular evidence.** The researchers are challenging the traditional understanding based on this new evidence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe fósil jejuhu (The fossil's discovery):** The passage doesn't focus on the discovery of the fossil itself, but on what the *molecular evidence* implies about the fossil.
* **B: Pe división (The division):**  The passage doesn't really discuss a division in terms of land or geography.
* **D: Pe tembikuaareka ojejapóva Rift Valley-pe (The research done in the Rift Valley):** While the research was done in the Rift Valley, the passage's focus is on the implications of the *molecular evidence*, not the research location itself.

Mba’épa ojapova’erã peteĩ oñembosaráiva omanipula hag̃ua umi jeku'e oiporu aja pe ta’ãngamýi ñembosarairãme?,"The correct answer is **B: Otriangula henda** (Triangulates it).

Here's why:

The text describes how the Nintendo Revolution controller uses sensors on the TV to track movement in a 3D space. This tracking is achieved by **triangulation**, which is a process of determining the position of an object by measuring the angles to it from multiple points.  The controller's sensors are used to create a triangular measurement to determine its position relative to the TV.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ejesareko porã umi sensor controlador reheguápa oñemohenda consola ypýpe** (Properly aligning the controller's sensors with the console) - While alignment is necessary, it doesn't describe the *process* of how the controller tracks movement.
*   **C: Emoĩ umi sensor TV ypýpe** (Places sensors on the TV) - The text states the sensors are *on* the TV, not *placed* on the TV.
*   **D: Emomýi pe controlador yvate rupive** (Moves the controller upwards) - This is incorrect and doesn't relate to the tracking mechanism.

Therefore, **triangulation** is the accurate description of how the controller determines the player's movements."
Mbaʼépa ojejapova’ekue ojogua hag̃ua pe TVcontrol remoto-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Pe controlador Nintendo Revolución rehegua** (The Nintendo Revolution controller).

Here's why:

* The text states that the controller uses two sensors on the back to track movement.
* It then describes how these sensors work with a TV remote to allow players to control the game in a 3D space.
* The whole passage is about the Nintendo Revolution controller.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi mokõi sensor controlador rehegua (The two sensors of the controller):** While the sensors are important, they aren't the *thing* used to control the game. The *controller* is.
* **C: Pe jehechaukarã principal (The main showcase):** The Tokyo Game Show is the event, not the control mechanism itself.
* **D: Pe consola Nintendo Revolución rehegua (The Nintendo Revolution console):** The console is necessary, but the passage focuses on the *controller* and how it interacts with the TV.

* The question asks what the news agency Xinhua reported regarding the hijacking.
* The text explicitly states: ""Marandu uperiregua he’i pe avión oguerekoha amenaza de bomba..."" (The security agency said the plane received a bomb threat...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe avión oguejy Ürümqi-pe** (The plane was heading to Ürümqi) - This is part of the story but not the primary information Xinhua reported *about* the hijacking.
* **C: Pe avión oguevi jeyha Afganistán-pe** (The plane was supposed to land in Afghanistan) - Similar to B, this is a detail of the hijacking but not the main reported information.
* **D: Pe avión oguejy Kandahar-pe** (The plane was heading to Kandahar) - This is a specific location within Afghanistan and not the core of the initial report.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Marandu uperiregua he’i pe avión oguerekoha amenaza de bomba..."" which translates to ""Security sources said the plane received a bomb threat...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe avión oĩha seceustrado (The plane was hijacked)** - While the plane *was* hijacked, the question specifically asks what the security sources reported. The bomb threat is the primary information they shared.
* **B: Pe avión oñembotoveha pya’e oguejy hag̃ua (The plane was flown quickly to)** -  This refers to the flight path to Ürümqi, not the initial report.
* **C: Pe avión oguevi jeyha Afganistán-pe (The plane was diverted to Afghanistan)** - This is a consequence of the hijacking/threat, but not the initial report.

Here's why:

* The text states that Sara Danius spoke publicly on a radio program about the Nobel Committee's decision regarding Bob Dylan's 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.
* Option A accurately reflects this.
* Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:
    * B is related to collaboration, not the prize itself.
    * C is about those awarded in 2016, but the focus is on the *decision* surrounding Dylan.
    * D is incorrect because the text clearly states the committee *did* discuss Dylan.



"
Mávandipa ndaikatúikuri oñeñe’ẽ?,"The correct answer is **B: Sara Danius**.

The question asks ""Mávandipa ndaikatúikuri oñeñe'ẽ?"" which translates to ""Who spoke publicly?"".

The text clearly states: ""Arakõipe, Sara Danius... oikuauka kuri publicamente..."" which means ""Sara Danius... spoke publicly..."".

Therefore, Sara Danius is the one who spoke publicly.
"
Mávapa he’iva’ekue pe ñe'ẽme'ẽ ha'eha “peteĩ paso tuichava”?,"The correct answer is **A: Momaranduha**.

The question asks what ""peteĩ paso tuichava"" refers to. The text says Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndroe, said that the US has a ""strong path"" (""peteĩ paso tuichava"") regarding dialogue with North Korea about nuclearization.  ""Momaranduha"" translates to ""message"" or ""communication,"" and in this context, it refers to the *path* or *approach* the US is taking. The other options identify people involved, but the phrase itself refers to the approach/path.

The 1000th work is recognized as being compiled in the Guinness World Records as """"The Great Work of Swedes"""" done by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl in the year 2000.""

The question asks how many works Słania has done in many countries. The text clearly states that the 1000th work is a record recognized by Guinness World Records. Therefore, the answer is 1000.  While the text mentions the year 2000 in relation to the recognition, the question is about the *number of works*.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe jejokoha renda yryrurãguýpe oñemyenyhẽ ikatuha peve (The oil reservoir is sufficient).** The text says there's a large oil reservoir, but it doesn't explain *why* the pipeline is vulnerable.
* **B: Peteĩ mba'era'ã jepiguáva rire tatarendy jeporavorape reheguávape (Due to a leak in the pipeline).** This is a circular argument. The question asks *why* leaks happen, not why leaks are a problem.
* **D: Peteĩ tatarendyguasu peteĩva mba'enohẽha pytaha Fort Greely-peguápe (A major leak occurred at Fort Greely).**  The text mentions a leak *could* occur in the future, not that one *did* happen at Fort Greely.

The text states: ""Peteĩ ñanirýi apañuãi rupi, mba'era'ã jepiguáva rire tatarendy jeporavorape rehegua..."" which translates to ""Due to a pipeline break..."" This directly answers the question of why the alarms were triggered.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oĩkuri takukue omyasãihaguére umi yryrurãguasu ryepýpe** (There is a significant leak in the oil field) - While a leak *could* trigger alarms, the text explicitly states a pipeline break as the cause.
* **C: Umi yryrurãguasu henyhẽtereímakuri** (The oil fields are emptying) - The text mentions oil fields, but doesn't connect their emptying to triggering alarms.
* **D: Pe jejokoha renda yryrurãguýpe rehegua ndikatúikuri oguereko heta mba'yruyvyra oñeikotevẽva** (The capacity of the oil field is not enough to hold many spilled materials) - The text actually mentions a significant capacity for spilled materials, making this option incorrect.

"Ko'ag̃aitéramo, mboýpiko pe y ijyvatekue pe Ninth Ward-pe?","The correct answer is **A: 6 m**.

The question asks how high the water reached in the Ninth Ward after Hurricane Katrina.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 150 mm** - This is the height of the dike, not the water level.
*   **C: Ku'a alturape** - This means ""at a great height"" and is a general description, not a specific measurement of water level.
*   **D: 300 m** - This is the length of a section of the dike, not the water level."
"Pe Huracán Katrina jave, mba’épa oikókuri Ninth Ward-pe?","The correct answer is **C: Umi y ku’a peve ijyvatekuéva ohasapákuri pe dique**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what happened to the Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.** The passage states: ""Upe Ninth Ward, ohecha vaekue upe y japyhy ohupyty vaekue 6 m upe Huracan Katrina jave..."" which translates to ""The Ninth Ward, which was seen to have flooded up to 6 m during Hurricane Katrina...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi y ojupiva’ekue ipekue oguerekókuri 300 m** - This refers to the length of a section of the dike, not what happened to the Ninth Ward.
* **B: Pe y ku’a peve ijyvatekuéva ohasapákuri pe dique** - This is a rephrasing of option C, and option C is a more direct and accurate answer.
* **D: 150 mm amangýre oitýkuri pe dique oñembyaíva** - This refers to the rainfall amount and the dike's capacity, not what happened to the Ninth Ward.

Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui nomoañetéikuri Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **C: Ojejapópakuri umi oñeikotevẽva ñeñangarekorã**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hospital ojapopaite oñeikotevẽva infección rehe ñeñangarekorã, ápe oike hasýva jeipe’a ambuégui ani hag̃ua oguerova avave rehe."" This translates to: ""The hospital performs isolation of infected patients, where the patient is treated in isolation until they recover.""
* **Option C directly reflects this statement.** It asks about what Hamilton *does* to prevent the spread of the virus. The isolation of infected patients is a key preventative measure.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Moõpa ohova’ekue pe hasýva (What does the patient do?)** - The passage focuses on what the *hospital* does, not the patient.
* **B: Pe probabilidad oĩva ambue hasýva ikatuha ojapyhy pe virus (The probability that another patient can transmit the virus)** - While relevant, the passage doesn't explicitly state the probability or discuss the likelihood of transmission from other patients.  It focuses on the hospital's actions.
* **D: Pe hasýva mba’échaitépa oĩ ko'ágãitéramo (What if the patient is in this state?)** - This is too general and doesn't address the specific actions taken by Hamilton (the hospital).



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text."

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...80 policía oĩ kuri ombohape haguã umi mba'yrumýi omboguatávape desvio-kuéra rehe."" ( ...80 police officers are securing the area for the detours.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojerure hikuái FBI-pe ohapemboty hag̃ua** (They are mainly relying on the FBI to investigate): While the FBI is involved, the text focuses on the local police's role in securing the area.
* **B: Odecidi hikuái ojapo jehapemboty** (They decided to conduct an investigation): The text doesn't say the police decided to investigate; they are reacting to the situation and securing the area.
* **D: Omombe'u hikuái jeiko mbegueve tráfico ipohýirupi upe ambue tape ojeiporúva pukukue** (They are informing about the slow traffic in the other road that is being used): While traffic is mentioned, the primary focus of the police's activity described is securing the detour area.

Here's why:

The passage states that the FBI is investigating the turning of trucks to **divert** tubes in the cargo. Option B accurately reflects this diversion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ojehapembotypa (They are being released):**  The passage describes a criminal investigation, not a release of tubes.
*   **C: Ojeipe’akuri ohasa hag̃ua umi mba'yrumýi omboguatávape (They are being cut through the cargo):** The passage mentions tubes being diverted, not cut through.
*   **D: Oĩkuri heta tráfico ipohýiva ombohapéva (There is a lot of slow traffic releasing):** While traffic is mentioned, it's a consequence of the incident, not what happened to the tubes themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe Patrulla de Caminos-pegua he’ikuri pe fotógrafo-pe ohasajey hag̃ua tape ambue gotyo:** While the police did tell the photographer to move, this is *how* they intervened, not *what* the photographer was doing that led to the intervention.
* **C: Pe fotógrafo oguenohẽkuri ta'ãnga peteĩ policía parada-pe:** The text says the photographer *approached* a police car, not that he *got out* of one.

""He is able to work effectively from home,"" Arias said in an interview.""

Option C directly reflects this information. The other options are not supported by the text:

* **A: Naiñakãnundúi (He is not well)** - The text explicitly says the President is well.
* **B: Opytáta hógape heta arapokõindy pukukue (He can go home with many apologies)** - The text says he *can* work from home, not that he needs to apologize.
* **D: Ojagarra vai chupe pe virus (He has caught the virus)** - The text implies he *doesn't* have the virus, as he is working from home due to being well.

Here's why:

The question asks *when* the Yvytuvai Yvyjopepygua Gonu starts to churn (ikãngyve). The text states: ""Ko árape pyharevete, yvytu oho 83 kilómetro aravóre rupi ha oñeha'ãrõ ikãngyve ohóvo."" (On this day, when the wind reaches 83 kilometers per hour, it starts to churn).

The other options are incorrect:

* **D: Og̃uahẽ mboyve yvytu 149 millas aravóre** (It arrives at a wind speed of 149 miles per hour) -  While the text mentions 149 miles per hour (240 kilometers), it's the *speed* at which it churns, not the arrival time.

Here's why:

* The question asks about the speed of the wind in miles when it is at its highest.
* The passage states the wind reaches 240 kilometers per hour.
* Option B gives the same speed in miles (240 miles per hour).
* Option C (249 miles per hour) is incorrect and not mentioned in the text.
* Option D (83 kilometers per hour) is the speed of the wind when it is at its lowest.

Therefore, the correct answer is the one that represents the wind speed in miles mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha'e peteĩchagua ygáu:** While true (it *is* an organism), this isn't the most significant or unique characteristic highlighted in the text.
* **C: Heta célula oguerekóva:** The passage mentions it's a unicellular organism (one cell), not multicellular.
* **D: Oikóva teko harupi:** This is true, but the passage emphasizes the toxicity as the key problem.  The fact that it lives in water is a descriptive detail, not a distinguishing trait causing harm.



Therefore, the ability to *kill fish and mammals* is the most important and defining characteristic mentioned in the passage.

* The text explicitly states: ""Ygau oguereko peteĩ mba'e tajygue oporombohasýva ikatúva omonge tajygue yvypóra ha pirápe."" (The algae has something dangerous that can kill fish and mammals.)
* The question asks what Karenia brevis *does* that prevents it from being controlled. The ability to produce this dangerous substance *is* what allows it to thrive and spread.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Omonge tajygue pirakuérape (It kills fish):** This is a *result* of what Karenia brevis does, not the reason it can't be controlled.
* **B: Pya’e oñembohetave ipapapýpe ojejuhúvo oimeraẽ condición-pe (It becomes more aggressive when exposed to sunlight):** While sunlight might influence its behavior, the core issue is the toxic substance it produces.

"He’ihaicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼãva apytégui ndoikói pe huracán Felicia rupi?","The correct answer is **A: Ama ouporãva (Surprisingly)**.

Here's why:

The text states that despite being a Category 4 hurricane, Felicia unexpectedly weakened into a tropical depression before making landfall. The ""mba'eporãramo"" (surprisingly) rainfall in Oahu further emphasizes this unexpected weakening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ama arasunu reheve (Due to wind)**: While wind is a factor in weakening hurricanes, the text focuses on the unexpected nature of the *entire* weakening process, not just the wind.
* **C: Aratiri akói (Rain)**: Rain is a symptom, not the cause of the unexpected weakening.
* **D: Tapekuéra oñapymíva (Due to human intervention)**: The text doesn't mention human interference.

Therefore, ""Ama ouporãva"" (Surprisingly) best captures the unexpected nature of Felicia's weakening."

Here's why:

The question asks what *isn't* stated about Hurricane Felicia. Option B directly contradicts the information given in the passage. The passage explicitly states that the storm *weakened into* a tropical depression *after* being a Category 4 hurricane. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pe ama oúva upévagui oipytyvõ Oahu-pe:** The passage states the storm *caused* significant rainfall in Oahu, not that the storm itself helped.
*   **C: Oky opavave umi isla-pe:** The passage states the storm *moved towards* the islands, but didn't necessarily make landfall. It also notes the islands remained unprepared.
*   **D: Umi amáme omoirũ aratiri:** The passage mentions thunderstorms and lightning associated with the storm.

* The text states: ""Piquet Jr. Oñemosẽ kuri upe Grand Prix Hungaria 2009 pegua."" This directly translates to ""Piquet Jr. appeared at the Grand Prix Hungary 2009.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernando Alonso ochoka kuri** (Fernando Alonso crashed) - While mentioned in the first sentence, it's not relevant to what happened to Piquet Jr. in the Hungarian Grand Prix.
* **B: Piquet Jr oñemotenondékuri** (Piquet Jr. caused [something]) - The text mentions his involvement in a safety car incident, but doesn't say he *caused* it in the Hungarian Grand Prix.
* **D: Pe mba'yru segurida regua oĩkuri peteĩ ojechokahápe** (The safety car appeared due to a crash) - While the safety car was involved, this option focuses on the safety car and not Piquet Jr.'s appearance."
Araka'épa oiko pe choque?,"The correct answer is **A: Alonso jepyt boxespe riremi** (When Alonso was pit).

The question asks *when* the collision occurred. The provided text states: ""Piquet Jr. ochoka kuri upe Grand Prix Singapur 2008pe, jepyta voi boxespe riremi Fernando Alonso ojapova, ha osẽ kuri upepe mba'yru segurida regua."" This translates to: ""Piquet Jr. collided in the Singapore Grand Prix 2008, it is said that when Fernando Alonso was pitting, a safety car was deployed.""

Therefore, the collision happened *when Alonso was pitting*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi ambue mba'yru omoĩ aja nafta** (When other cars refueled) - This describes a separate action, not the cause of the collision.
* **C: Osẽ mboyve pe mba'yru segurida regua** (When the safety car was deployed) - The deployment of the safety car was a *result* of the collision, not the event itself.
* **D: Piquet oike rire nafta piári** (When Piquet went to refuel) - The text states Piquet Jr. collided, not that he went to refuel."

The passage states that researchers in Princeton and Uppsala studied the evolution of a finch species on the Galapagos Islands. They observed the evolution of the endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortes*, from an immigrant finch, *Geospiza conirostris*, over two generations. 

Therefore, the study focuses on the **evolution** (ñemoheñói) of the wild species.  The other options are not as accurate:

* **B: Ñemomarandu pe especie rehegua (Information about the species):** While the study provides information, it's specifically about *how* the species evolved.
* **C: Ñemoheñói opaichagua especie apytépe (Evolution of all species):**  The passage is about a specific finch species, not all species.
* **D: Ñemoheñói orekóva pe especie (Evolution of the species they observed):** While close, ""pe especie pyahu ñemoheñói"" is a more direct and complete description of the evolution being studied.

* The study focuses on how a finch species in the Galapagos Islands evolved over two generations. 
* It compares the evolution of a native finch (Geospiza fortes) with a finch that immigrated from elsewhere (Geospiza conirostris). 
* The researchers are essentially investigating the mechanisms of evolution through this comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Moõpa heñói pe especie pyahu** (How the wild species evolved) - While the study *does* explore how the species evolved, the core focus is on the *process* of evolution itself, not just *how* it happened in this specific case.
* **C: Pe especie pyahu réra** (The wild species' fate) - The study doesn't primarily focus on the future of the species, but rather on the mechanisms driving its evolutionary changes.
* **D: Umi guyra oikeva’ekue pe ñemoheñóime** (The incoming birds' ability to colonize) -  This is a *part* of the study, but the overarching theme is the evolutionary process, not just colonization.

The text explicitly states: ""Mba'eporã'apogua oikótava ha'e avei peteĩ aporã omoakãva Bucarest Tavaróga..."" which translates to ""It is also a wonderful event held in Bucharest...""

While the other options might be related in a broader sense (CowParade is popular in Europe), the text specifically mentions Bucharest.

* The paragraph states: ""Pe táva ha'éta peteĩha Europa yvy ha kuarahy resẽ gotyoguápe oguerekótava CowParade..."" which translates to ""The city is the first in Europe and the Mediterranean to host CowParade..."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiko umi tavusu ojeheróva “creativapente”** (It features creatively decorated cows): While true, this is *part* of CowParade, not the defining characteristic.
* **B: Omoakã Bucarest Tavaróga** (It takes place in Bucharest city): This is a location, not a description of what CowParade *is*.
* **D: Ha'e pe mba'eporã'apo avaetagua rehegua tuichavéva ko yvy ape ári** (It is the most popular art exhibition in this country): The paragraph doesn't claim CowParade is the *most* popular. It simply mentions it's a unique art exhibition.

The text states: ""Upe Il-76 ha'eva'ekue mba'e Rusia ha Soviético milíko atygua oñemomba'eguasúva 1970 pa'arajere guive, ha oikomavoíkuri hese mba'e'aindýi Rusia-pe jasy ohasávape.""  This translates to: ""The Il-76 has been a valuable asset of the Russian and Soviet military since 1970, and has been used to transport these valuable items to Russia since the early 1990s.""

While the other options mention military and Soviet origins, the text directly identifies the Il-76 as transporting **valuable items** (""mba'e'aindýi""). Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.
"
Mba’épa pe II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ pepo'atã (An aircraft)**.

The text states: ""Upe Il-76 ha'eva'ekue mba'e Rusia ha Soviético milíko atygua oñemomba'eguasúva 1970 pa'arajere guive..."" which translates to ""The Il-76 is an aircraft that was used by the Russian and Soviet military since 1970...""  The first sentence also mentions ""pepo'atã oho'aínakuri Irkutsk"".

Therefore, the Il-76 is an aircraft, not a submarine, tank, or train.

This translates to: ""And in 1989, Brooks and Groening helped improve The Simpsons, and their team included a talented show writer. **In 1993, he created the show, became a co-executive producer, and earned tens of millions of dollars in royalties from every season that aired.**""

The text explicitly mentions Simon as the talented show writer who created the show and became a co-executive producer.
"
"Fluke heʼiháicha, mávapa omondo chupe hetaiterei temiandu porã ha ñemokyre'ỹ?","The correct answer is **A: Pohãnoharakuéra (Dating)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what Fluke says leads to so many beautiful and sophisticated messages that attract young people. The text explicitly states that Fluke's device helps to ""date"" (pohãnoharakuéra) and that this leads to a lot of attractive and sophisticated messages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuñanguéra tesãirã rehe omba'apóva (Women who are sending [messages])**: While women are involved in the messages, it's not the *cause* of the messages being attractive.
* **C: Kuimba’ekuéra (Men)**: The text mentions men are involved in sending messages, but it doesn't explain *why* the messages are beautiful and sophisticated.
* **D: Umi kuimba’e ha kuña (Men and Women)**: This is too general. The answer needs to be more specific about what's causing the beautiful messages.



"
"Pe pehẽnguépe heʼiháicha, mbaʼe rehépa ndojeipotaiva’ekue kuñanguéra oñeʼẽ?","The correct answer is **A: Kuimba’ekuérare** (Because of men).

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* women aren't allowed to speak when men are, according to the text.** The first sentence states that the Fluke Ohaíkuri ritual prevents women from speaking when men are, and it does so to ensure men can have many good thoughts and clear ideas, without being disturbed by the ""noisy"" voices of women. This implies it's the men who are the reason for the restriction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi ojehepyme’ẽva ñepohãnorã rehe** (Because of those who have a relationship with the source): This is too vague and doesn't directly address the reason for the restriction.
* **C: Kuñanguéra tesãirã rehe** (Because of women's talk): The text implies it's not the women themselves, but the *noise* of their voices that's the problem.
* **D: Fluke** (Fluke): Fluke is the name of the ritual, not the reason *why* women are silenced.



Therefore, the most logical answer based on the provided text is **A: Kuimba’ekuérare**."

Mba'épa ko'ã mba'e ojetopáva ndaha'éiva osẽva pe tague jejuhúgui?,"The correct answer is **A: Mymba rague sa’y (Fat in the skull)**.

Here's why:

The text states that scientists believe the skull's fat is a type of brown fat, derived from carotenoids in the diet. It also mentions that this skull fat is a key feature in understanding skull evolution. The text further suggests this skull fat developed as dinosaurs evolved to be more agile and capable of running. It even indicates that the skull fat may have helped control the dinosaurs' body temperature.

Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the text as the *reason* for the skull fat's existence. While related to the broader topic of dinosaurs and evolution, the text focuses specifically on the skull fat itself. Therefore, the fat in the skull is the most directly cited and discussed aspect in the provided text.
"
Mba’épa ndorekoiva’ekue umi dinosaurio rague?,"The correct answer is **C: Guyrarague okakuaapava (Well-developed feathers)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Upe guyrarague kuera ohechauka ndojepurúi haguã tera ocontrola haguã arapytu tera ohechauka haguã.""  This translates to: ""This feather allows control of the temperature of the body."" and ""Umi investigador kuera he'i kuri, jepe pea ha'e peteĩ dinosaurio ra'y ruguái, pe techarã ohechauka guyra rague okakuaapava regua ha ndaha'éi peteĩ michĩva regua."" which translates to: ""Researchers say it is a young dinosaur, the feather shows a well-developed plumage and not a small one.""

The text emphasizes the development of feathers (guyrarague okakuaapava) as a key evolutionary characteristic. While the other options are mentioned, feathers are highlighted as the main result of this evolutionary development.

The text explicitly states: ""Jeitypeka porãve ohechauka kuri oguerekoha sa'ive mba'e porã oñeha'ãrovaekuegui ojoko haguã ñemano."" This translates to ""It was successfully shown to be effective in preventing monkeys from being infected.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojejapo anticuerpo-gui (It is made from an antibody):** While Zmapp *is* an antibody, the question asks what the text *doesn't* say *about* Zmapp. The text doesn't focus on its origin in detail.
* **B: Ha'e oipohanokuaa umi infección ha katu ndaikatúi ojoko ñemano (It prevents infections and monkeys were not infected):**  The text says Zmapp *was successfully shown to prevent* infection *in monkeys*. It doesn't state that monkeys *weren't* infected.
* **C: Oipytyvõ ojehechaporã hag̃ua pe ensayo PALM-peguápe (It helps to improve the PALM trial):** While Zmapp *was* used in the PALM trial, the text doesn't say it *helps* improve the trial. It only says it was tested *within* the PALM trial.

This translates to: ""In the PALM trial, Zmapp was administered alongside a control group, meaning scientists tested it against three other treatments.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi jeitypeka ohechauka ikatuha oguereko hetave mba’e porã oñeha'ãrõva'ekuégui:** While the text mentions scientists found promising results, this option is too general. It doesn't capture the specific design of the PALM trial.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umi escarpe ojejuhu jasy tuichakue ha vaicha oĩ michĩmi erosionado, upéva ohechauka umievento geológico ijapohare ramoite guareha.""  This translates to: ""The escarpments are found in a lot of water and their sides are less eroded, which shows a geological event occurring.""

The question asks what the *lobular* escarpments are *not* (ndaha'ei). The passage connects the lobular shape to the fact that they are formed by smaller amounts of water (""jasy michĩve rupi""). Therefore, option C directly contradicts the passage's description of how these escarpments are formed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiméne nda’aréi oikohague umi mba’e omoheñóiva’ekue chupekuéra (It's not seen when small things are formed).** This is irrelevant to the question about the lobular escarpments.
* **B: Oĩha hikuái he'ise jasýpe ndofaltaiha pe actividad geológica (Some say there is no geological activity in the water).** The passage *contradicts* this idea, suggesting geological activity *did* occur.
* **D: Ndahetái ojejuhu jasy ape ári (They are not found in water).** The passage explicitly states they are found in a lot of water.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼe teoría oñe’ẽva umi accidente geográfico rehépa ohechauka oĩha actividad geológica jasýpe?","The correct answer is **A: Jasy michĩve rupi ohóvo ko'ẽreíre** (Because they are formed by the erosion of small hills).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umi escarpe ojejuhu jasy tuichakue ha vaicha oĩ michĩmi erosionado, upéva ohechauka umievento geológico ijapohare ramoite guare."" (The cliffs are seen as very high and the base is smaller and eroded, which shows a geological event that happened).

This directly connects the eroded base (small hills) to the geological event.  Option A reflects this connection.  The other options are not supported by the text.

*   **B: Umi accidente geográfico ymaite guive ojejapo** (Geographical features are formed by volcanic activity) - The text doesn't mention volcanic activity.
*   **C: Oĩ michĩmi accidente geográfico isarambíva pe jasy apére** (There are smaller geographical features that are eroded by the river) -  While erosion is involved, this doesn't explain the geological event.
*   **D: Umi accidente geográfico ramoite guare** (Due to the geographical features) - This is too general and doesn't specify *how* the features indicate a geological event.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'épa ndojeikuaaukamo'ãvéima acusación peve?","The correct answer is **A: Ndojeikuaaukamo'ãvéima temiandu**.

The text explicitly states: ""Corona-pegua oficina, omotenondéva enjuiciamiento-kuéra, he'i kuri periodista-kuérape ndojeikuaukamo'ãveimaha temiandu ágã acusación peve."" This translates to: ""The Crown Office, which manages the trials, says that journalists cannot have access to the accusation details.""

Therefore, journalists are not able to access the accusation details.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'épa ndaha'éi apañuái ko'ág̃a umi sellador-pe g̃uarã?","The correct answer is **D: Yrypy'a hykúva (Shaved seal)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pittman he'íkuri arapytu naiporãmo'ãiha ambue arapokõindy meve. Pittman he'iháicha, yrypy'a retakue ha anambusukue ha'e mba'e ivaivéva umi foca omymbajukávape g̃uarã 15 ary ohasávape."" This translates to: ""Pittman says that no other seal is as good. As Pittman says, a shaved seal and a spotted seal are what is diverse among seals that live for 15 years.""

The question asks what is NOT a seal that's good for sealers. The text identifies **shaved seals (yrypy'a hykúva)** as *not* being the best option compared to spotted seals (yrypy'a retakue) and spotted seals (anambusukue).  The other options are mentioned as good types of seals.
"
"Pe yrypy’a ári, mba’e ambue mba’e oafectáva pyrysõ ñepia'ã?","The correct answer is **B: Arapytu rehegua (Regarding the blowhole)**.

The text states that the blowhole (arapytu) is the most vulnerable part of the whale. It also mentions that the blowhole and the whale's respiration are linked, and that this vulnerability is linked to the fact that whales can live up to 15 years.

The question asks what *other* factors affect the blowhole's sensitivity. Option B directly addresses this, while the other options are not mentioned or relevant to the text.
"
Mba’e jerovia piko Roberts ombotovete?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe ética oñeñe’ẽvo umi káso rehe** (Ethics when discussing cases).

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""ombotovete voi he'i hag̃ua ha'e oroviava mba'e momentopepa upe tekove oñepyrũ, peteĩ ñeporandu guasu ojeñe'ẽro upe etica membykua reheguare..."" This translates to ""Roberts said that at a moment when the country was just starting, after a big announcement about women's ethics...""  The key point is that the announcement was *about ethics relating to cases*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñemomba'eguasuva'erã Tekojojaro Rusu apopyrã ijojáva** (The overthrow of the Russian Constitution) - While mentioned, this is a consequence Roberts links to Roe vs. Wade, not the main topic of his initial statement.
* **C: Tekove ñepyrũ** (The country's beginning) -  Roberts mentions the country's beginning as the *time* of the announcement, not the subject of his statement.
* **D: Tekokatu ha'éva ñemi rehegua** (The issue concerning us) - This is a detail about the impact of Roe vs. Wade, not the core of what Roberts said.



"
Mba’e témapa Roberts he'i ndaha’emo'ãiha etico oñeñe’ẽ hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **D: Umi mba’e específico umi káso rehegua**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Roberts says it's unethical to speak about ""umí káso ndaha'éva añetegua"" (those specific cases that are not yet decided). 
* Option D directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe Tekojojaro Rusu apopyrã ijojáva (The Russian Constitution):** While Roberts mentions the Russian Constitution, the passage doesn't say that's the *topic* he finds unethical to discuss. It's mentioned as an example of a legal precedent.
* **B: Pe decisión Roe v Wade rehegua (The Roe v. Wade decision):** Roberts *names* Roe v. Wade as a ""grounding law,"" but the unethical topic isn't the Roe v. Wade decision itself, but rather discussing the specific cases related to it *before* a decision.
* **C: Tekokatu oje'e'ỹva ha'éva ñemi rehegua (Cases that are being discussed/mentioned):** This is too broad. The ethical issue is not about discussing *all* discussed cases, but the specific, undecided cases.



"
Moõpa omimbi umi araveraichagua hendýva?,"The correct answer is **A: Ára gotyo** (The next day).

The passage states: ""Mokõi araveraichagua hendyva ojupy ára gotyo upe pyhare mbytepe."" which translates to ""The two other people met the next day at the foot of the mountain.""
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, araka'épa oñemopu'ãta rascacielos pyahu upe tendápe?","The correct answer is **A: Ára mbytépe (The next day)**.

The text states: ""Mokõi araveraichagua hendyva ojupy ára gotyo upe pyhare mbytepe."" This translates to ""The two teams met the next day at the foot of the building.""

Therefore, the skyscraper was completed the next day.
"
Mbaʼe marandúpa ohechauka umi Pokõi Kypy'y haʼeha itakua?,"The correct answer is **A: Arapytu ñemoambue (Infrared radiation)**.

The text states: ""Ta'ãnga infrarrojo ohechauka arapytu ñemoambue pyharekue ha pyharevekue, upéva he'ise ha'eha itakua."" This translates to: ""Infrared detection reveals heat signatures of warm and cool objects, which is what it means to be a thermal.""

Therefore, the answer is that thermal imaging reveals heat signatures, which is based on infrared radiation.
"
Mba’éichapa ojehechakuaa umi Pokõi Kypy'y rakukue ñemoambue ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ta’ãnga infrarrojo rupive (Infrared detection)**.

The text states: ""Ta'ãnga infrarrojo ohechauka arapytu ñemoambue pyharekue ha pyharevekue, upéva he'ise ha'eha itakua."" This translates to: ""Infrared detection reveals thermal radiation, which is what it is."""
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'e ñe’ẽasãi pe tapicha oje'eha o rehegua ndaha'éi añeteguáva?","The correct answer is **B: Oje'e ombokapuha peteĩ explosivo.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what the person *didn't* say that could be considered suspicious.** The passage states the person said an explosive device was ""detonated.""  This is a factual statement about what happened.

* Options A, C, and D all point to potentially suspicious elements:
    * **A: Oiporu peteĩ mba'yrumýi explosión aja (They are carrying an explosive device):** This is a highly suspicious claim.
    * **C: Mburuvichakuéra oikuaa mba’e etnia-guápa (The police know their ethnicity):** While knowing ethnicity *could* be relevant in some investigations, it's not inherently suspicious on its own, especially since the ethnicity was already known.
    * **D: Chupe ndojehúi mba’eve (They didn't say anything):** This is not a statement the person *made*, it's a statement about what they *didn't* say.

Therefore, the only statement the person made that *isn't* inherently suspicious is the one about the explosive device detonating.
"
Mba'e marandu explosión reheguáva omoañete mburuvichakuéra?,"The correct answer is **A: Umi omo’ãva’ekue identidad (The claimed identity of the perpetrator)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the people who witnessed the explosion *don't know* the cause, but they *do* know the person claimed to be Uyghur. This indicates their primary piece of information is the perpetrator's claimed identity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mba’e etnia-guápa pe tapicha oje'eha (The ethnicity the person claims to be):** While the text mentions the person claims to be Uyghur, the question is about the *information* the witnesses have about the explosion itself.  Knowing the claimed ethnicity doesn't explain what *caused* the explosion.
* **C: Pe mba’e omokyre’ỹva ojejapo hag̃ua pe explosión (What was used to create the explosion):** The witnesses *don't know* what created the explosion. The text specifically says ""Mburuvichakuéra ndoikuaái gueteri héra"" (The witnesses don't know the cause).
* **D: Pe tapicha oje’eha réra ha herajoapy (The person's claim of being injured):** The text states the person claims to be injured, but this doesn't explain the explosion itself.  While relevant to the situation, it's not the primary piece of information the witnesses have *about the explosion*.



"
Mba'e atýpa oha'ãta pe partido Ellis Park-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: All Blacks ha Australia**.

The text states: ""Ñeha'ã paha upe rysýi rehegua oikóta Ellis Park-pe Johannesburgo-pe arapokõindy oútavape, Springboks oha'ãvove Australia ndive."" which translates to: ""Will the same result be seen at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, with the Springboks playing against Australia?""

Therefore, the match at Ellis Park will be between the All Blacks and Australia.
"
Moõpa oha'ãta Springboks' partido oúva?,"The correct answer is **A: Australia**.

The text states: ""Ñeha'ã paha upe rysýi rehegua oikóta Ellis Park-pe Johannesburgo-pe arapokõindy oútavape, Springboks oha'ãvove Australia ndive."" which translates to ""The victory was also seen at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, with the Springboks defeating Australia.""
"
Mávandipa ko’ãva apytégui oguerekókuri apañuái pe tembiapo estación espacial aja?,"The correct answer is **A: Oñeñemomombyry hekopete umi propulsor-gui (They are propelled by powerful thrusters).**

Here's why:

The text states that Chiao and Sharipov were warned about a problem with powerful thrusters. The question asks *how* the work of the space station is maintained. The problem with the thrusters directly relates to *how* the station's work is sustained - they are the source of the necessary propulsion.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Oñemantene peteĩ giroscopio (A gyroscope is maintained):** While gyroscopes are used for stability, the text highlights a *problem* with the thrusters, not with the gyroscope.
* **C: Oñemyendy avión (Planes are flown):** The text mentions planes flying to the station to refuel, but this is a method of *supporting* the station, not the core way the station *operates*.
* **D: Oñemohenda porã jey (It is refueled well):** Similar to C, refueling is a method of support, not the fundamental aspect of the station's operation.

Therefore, the most direct answer based on the information provided is that the space station's work is sustained by powerful thrusters.

Here's why:

The text mentions that Chiao and Sharipov used powerful propellants to overcome the challenges of the work at the space station.  Option B directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojejuhu peteĩ giroscopio okañyva’ekue** (Finding a malfunctioning gyroscope): While a malfunctioning gyroscope might be a problem, the text highlights the use of powerful propellants as a solution to work challenges, not simply finding a faulty component.
* **C: Oñemohu’ãvo peteĩ caminata espacial** (Performing a spacewalk): The text mentions spacewalks as part of the work, but doesn't portray it as *the* solution. It's one method among others.
* **D: Oñemyendy avión-kuéra** (Using airplanes): The text states that Russian cosmonauts used airplanes to *deliver* materials to the station, not as part of the actual work being done *at* the station.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ojeguereko peteĩ condena ojeiporúvo mbojojaha oñeguenohẽ va'ekue 2003-pe ojehapejoko haguã corro masivo, ojeikuaáva ave spam-ramo, oñemoguahẽva poruharakuéra marandu guahẽhápe ojerure'ỹre.""
* **Translation:** ""...it received a sentence for being held responsible for the massive crash in 2003, known also for spam, which sent messages of warning when email could not be sent.""
* **Option C accurately reflects this sentence.** It directly mentions the sentence received for being held responsible for email not being able to be sent (due to the crash).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñembohasa kuri pe estado oimehápe AOL róga (It was released by the state where AOL is located):** The passage doesn't mention AOL being released by a state. It mentions a sentence being received.
* **B: Ojeguereko peteĩ condena (A sentence was received):** While true, it's a general statement. Option C is more specific and accurately reflects the *reason* for the sentence.
* **D: AOL-pe ojehepyme’ẽkákuri oikóvo (AOL when it is seen):** This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Mávapa ko’ã mbaʼe ojeʼévagui omombeʼu porã upe ojehúva?,"The correct answer is **A: AOL rehe oje'e ojapohague distribución ndojejeruréiva’ekue** (AOL was accused of not preventing distribution).

Here's why:

* The question asks what the mentioned events *reveal* about the case.
* The passage states that AOL was accused of failing to prevent the spread of a massive worm and spam. This implies a failure to implement proper distribution controls or preventative measures.
* Options B, C, and D are factual details *about* the case, but they don't explain what the events reveal about AOL's responsibility or failure.  While C is a fact, it doesn't explain the *meaning* of the events.  B is irrelevant. D is also not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, option A best captures the underlying issue revealed by the events: AOL was accused of a failure in its system to prevent the worm's spread.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'e clubpe oñepyrũ ojuga kuri Vidal mbohapy ara vore ohasava’ekuépe?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla-pe**.

The text states: ""Vidal, oguerekova 28 ary, oike kuri Barçape ojapoma mbohapy ara vore, Sevilla gui."" This translates to: ""Vidal, at 28 years old, joins Barça for three years, from Sevilla.""  Therefore, he *joins* Barça *from* Sevilla.
"
Mboy partido ojuga kuri Vidal Barça-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Vidal ojuga kuri 49 partido ko clubpe."" which translates to ""Vidal has played 49 matches for the club.""
"
Mávapa pe equipo ombohováiva pe partido-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The question asks ""Mávapa pe equipo ombohováiva pe partido-pe?"" which translates to ""Who does the team play against in the match?"". The text states: ""equipo ha’e oĩha hotel-pe partidooha’ãtava arateĩ Bolonia rovake mboyve."" which translates to ""the team is staying in a hotel for the match against Bologna.""

Therefore, the team plays against **Bolonia**.
"
Mbaʼérepiko Jarque opyta kuri pe hotel-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Oguerekókuri peteĩ partido upe arateĩme** (He is staying in the hotel for a match).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Opyta kuri equipo ha’e oĩha hotel-pe partidooha’ãtava arateĩ Bolonia rovake mboyve."" This translates to ""The team is staying in the hotel for the match against Bologna."" 
* Jarque is part of the team, so he is also staying in the hotel *for that match*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha’e oñemongu'e hina kuri (He is training)** - While he *is* training (pre-season training), the text specifically says he's in the hotel *for the match*.
* **B: Oguereko peteĩ entrenamiento pretemporada rehegua (He is having a pre-season training)** -  Again, he's having pre-season training, but the context is about the *match* and his location is the hotel for that match.
* **D: Oguerekókuri entrenamiento Bolonia ndive (He is having training against Bologna)** - He's not specifically having training *against* Bologna in the hotel. He's staying in the hotel *for the match* against Bologna.

Mba'érepiko yvyrekorete myakãha Yakarta-gua nomosarambíri mba'eveichagua marãndu tsunami rehegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndaipórikuri ñemongyhyje tsunami rehegua (We don't have early warning systems for tsunamis)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndaipórirõ jepe ñemongyhyje tsunami rehegua, tapichakuéra oikóva upépe oñepyrũ okyhyjeterei ha oheja iñemuha ha hogakuéra."" (Without an early warning system for tsunamis, the people who were there immediately ran and went to the evacuation centers.)

This directly links the lack of an early warning system to the immediate reaction of the people. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Ani hag̃ua okyhyjeterei tapichakuéra oikóva upépe (People there didn't run).** The passage explicitly says they *did* run.
*   **C: Ani hag̃ua ombyai umi ñemuha upepeguápe (There wasn't a way to inform the evacuation centers).** The passage doesn't mention a problem with informing the centers, only about early warning systems.
*   **D: Ndohupytyihaguére tuichakue ojejeruréva oje’e hag̃ua ha’eha peteĩ yvyryrýi (Because it reached a magnitude of 7).** While the magnitude is mentioned, the passage focuses on the lack of an early warning system as the main reason for the reaction. The magnitude triggered the tsunami, but the *lack of warning* triggered the immediate response.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ojapo pe yvyryrýi?","The correct answer is **A: Tapichakuéra oikóva upépe jekyhyjeterei** (People there evacuated).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndaipórirõ jepe ñemongyhyje tsunami rehegua, tapichakuéra oikóva upépe oñepyrũ okyhyjeterei ha oheja iñemuha ha hogakuéra."" This translates to: ""Without warning of a tsunami, people there began to evacuate and go to higher ground.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Peteĩ ñemongyhyje tsunami rehegua (A tsunami warning):** While a warning *might* have been issued, the text explicitly states there was *no warning*.
* **C: Peteĩ ñemosarambi marãndu tsunami rehegua (A simulated tsunami):** The text discusses a real tsunami, not a simulation.
* **D: Peteĩ 6,5 pe escala tuichakuépe (A 6.5 on the scale):**  The 6.5 refers to the magnitude of the earthquake, not the tsunami itself. The passage describes the *effect* of the earthquake (the tsunami) and the *reaction* of the people.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui oimpulsa kuarahy rembiapo ha opaite ambue mbyjakuera rembiapo?,"The correct answer is **B: Rossy papaha, ijere ha umi inversión magnética**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks *what* drives the Sun's activity and other astrophysical phenomena *based on the previous statement*.**
* **The previous statement explicitly mentions:**
    * **Hendykue (Differential Rotation):**  The Sun's differential rotation is a key driver of magnetic field generation.
    * **Ijere (Jet):** Jets are linked to plasma flows and influence the Sun's activity.
    * **Rossby papaha (Rossby Waves):**  Rossby waves are related to plasma flows and are involved in the formation of magnetic inversions.
    * **Inversión magnética (Magnetic Inversion):** Magnetic inversions are a consequence of the interaction between the Sun's differential rotation and plasma flows.

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the key components identified in the text that drive the Sun's activity and related phenomena.  Options A, C, and D are incomplete.
"
Mba'éichapa ojekuaa peteĩ mbyja Rossby papaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Hendykue ha ijere (Winds and Vortices)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Upe hendykue ha ijere ojeipuru oñondive oñemoi haguã Rossby papaha...""  This translates to ""The winds and vortices create a Rossby wave...""

Therefore, a Rossby wave is created by winds and vortices.
"
Mba’e porcentajepa tapichakuéra ombohovai va'ekue encuesta omboaje Australia-gui oiko va'erãha peteĩ república?,"The correct answer is **B: 29%**.

The text states: ""Encuenta apýrape, 29% ombohováiva porandu oimo'ã Australia-gui oiko va'erãha peteĩ república ikatuvovéntema..."" which translates to ""According to the survey, 29% expressed support for Australia becoming a republic.""
"
"Julia Gillard he’iháicha, araka’épa oikova’erã Australia-gui peteĩ república?","The correct answer is **B: Opa rire reina Isabel II reinado** (Without Queen Elizabeth II's reign).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Primera ministra interina Julia Gillard omboaje kuri federal-kuéra jeiporavo campaña aja 2010-pe oimo'ãha Australia-gui oiko va'erãha peteĩ república opa rire reina Isabel II reinado.""

This translates to: ""Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard launched a federal election campaign in 2010 proposing that Australia become a republic without Queen Elizabeth II's reign.""

Therefore, Julia Gillard proposed Australia becoming a republic *without* the Queen.



"
Mba'e organización-pa oĩ investigación legal guýpe?,"The correct answer is **D: Investigación ha Supervisón Subcomité**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Investigación ha Supervisón Subcomité (Investigation and Oversight Subcommittee) of the House Energy and Commerce Committee is involved in the investigation regarding Planned Parenthood.  The question asks which organization is involved in legal investigation, and the text directly identifies the subcommittee.
"
Cliff Stearns mba’e comité omoakã?,"The correct answer is **D: Investigación ha Supervisón Subcomité**.

The text states: ""...Investigación ha Supervisón Subcomité mburuvicháramo, Cámara po guýpe."" This translates to ""...within the Investigation and Oversight Subcommittee, of the House.""

While Cliff Stearns is associated with the House of Representatives (option B), the question specifically asks what *committee* he was part of. The passage clearly identifies the Investigación ha Supervisón Subcomité.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ndojehúi pe kuña Suiza-guápe?","The correct answer is **D: Oñemonda ipumbyrymýi ha computadora portatil**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ro japyhy kuri po tapicha oviola va'ekue kuña Suiza-gua ha ojejuhu jey ipumbyrymýi ha computadora portatil."" which translates to ""We are investigating the person who violated the Swiss house and found their mobile phone and laptop.""

The text states: ""ha katu papañemohendaha rypa'ũmegua jejogua ñemuha oñembojuavyereíta ha oñemoambuéta ASUS oñembojopói rire 2007 Taiwán Ñembokakuaapuku Jopói ndive ome'ẽva Mburuvicha Yuan República de China-gua.""

This translates to: ""and, in response, ASUS, after the meeting was revealed, and was supported by the President of the Republic of China, Yuan, who was presented by the 2007 Taiwan National Assembly.""

Therefore, ASUS was presented at the 2007 Taiwan National Assembly.
"
Mba'épa pe ASUS Eee PC?,"The correct answer is **B: Peteĩ computadora portatil (A portable computer)**.

The text explicitly states ""ASUS Eee PC, oñeg̃uenohẽvakuri arapy tuichakue javevére ndahepýigui ha oiko porãgui"" which translates to ""ASUS Eee PC, although it is small and light, it works well"".  This description aligns with a portable computer. While it predates the widespread use of tablets, it's definitely a type of computer.
"
Mávapa ha’e responsable umi documemto postal okañýva rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Umi omba’apóva correo-pe** (Those who reported it to the mail).

Here's why:

The text states that many people in Obanazawa began receiving mail with Ary Pyahu cards attached.  Furthermore, the problem arose when these cards were sent to a large number of people (600, with 429 specifically being Ary Pyahu). The responsibility for *those documents being sent* would fall on the postal service (""umi omba’apóva correo-pe"" - those who reported it to the mail) because they are the ones handling the mail and responsible for its distribution. The people in Obanazawa were *receiving* the mail, not sending it.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umi tapicha oikóva Obanazawa-pe** (Those who live in Obanazawa): While they received the mail, they aren't responsible for its sending.
*   **C: Peteĩ mitã** (A certain group):  The text doesn't specify a certain group as being responsible.
*   **D: Marandu myasãihakuéra** (The messengers/notifiers): The text implies the messengers were *not* the ones sending the mail with the Ary Pyahu cards. They were the ones *notifying* people about the issue.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ojejerure toñeñyrõmi chupekuéra  umi documento postal  okañýva rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Umi tapicha upepegua (The people who are affected)**.

The passage states that ""heta tapicha upepegua"" (many people affected) were sent the postal cards. The question asks who receives the postal documents. The answer is the people who are affected.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe mitã (The town/city):** The town isn't specifically mentioned as receiving the documents. It's the *people* in the town who were affected.
* **C: Marandu myasãihakuéra (The informants/news providers):** The informants are the source of the news, not the recipients of the documents.
* **D: Obanazawa correo rembiapo renda rovái noguahẽi rupi chupekuéra tarjeta jepivegua Ary Pyahu rehegua (The Obanazawa postal service department):** This is the organization that *sent* the documents, not the recipients.



"
Araka'épa oikotevẽkuri Del Potro oñeipohãno ijati’ýpe?,"The correct answer is **D: Tie break mbohapyha rire**.

Here's why: The question states that Del Potro was down in the tiebreak when the score was 6-6.  This means the tiebreak was in its third set (or, more accurately, third *tiebreak* of the match).  The text then says he recovered and went on to win.
"
Mba’éichapa osẽ pe tie break peteĩha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ogana Del Potro set mokõiha** (Del Potro wins the second set).

Here's why:

* The question states that Del Potro initially had a set lead.
* It then says they went to a tiebreak when the score was 6-6 in the second set.
* The question asks about the outcome of the *first* tiebreak.
* The information given doesn't specify who won the first tiebreak. However, since the question mentions Del Potro had a set lead, the most logical implication is that Del Potro won the tiebreak to win the *second* set.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Operde Murray set peteĩha** (Murray loses the first set) - This is true, but it doesn't tell us about the tiebreak.
* **B: Del Potro operde oñehunga rire** (Del Potro loses by losing) - This doesn't make sense in the context of tennis.
* **C: Ogana Murray set mokõiha** (Murray wins the second set) - This is the opposite of what we can infer from the problem.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa, específicamente ojojuhúkuri pe hasýva ndive?","The correct answer is **A: Karai gobernador**.

The passage states: ""He’ive ohóvo: “Kóva ivaieterei. Eikuaáke ore sistema oikoha hína tekotevẽhaichaite”"" which translates to ""He said: “It’s difficult. We know our system is not as effective as it should be.”""

The ""he'ive"" (he said) refers to **the governor (Karai gobernador)**. The governor is the one expressing the difficulty and acknowledging the system's shortcomings. The rest of the options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Mitã** means ""people"" - The passage doesn't specify *who* is struggling, just that the system isn't effective.
*   **C: Umi mba’apohára Texas-pegua** means ""people from outside Texas"" - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Tavayguakuéra upepegua** means ""other people"" - Similar to option C, this is not directly addressed in the quote.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’e seguridad nome’ẽi pe gobernador oñe’ẽvo umi Texas tavayguápe?","The correct answer is **A: Pe sistema oikoha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kóva ivaieterei. Eikuaáke ore sistema oikoha hína tekotevẽhaichaite."" This translates to ""This is not working. I know our system is flawed."" 

Therefore, the governor says the **system** is flawed, not that security is lacking in Texas.

Mba'e fuente momarãndu ñeha'ã pukarã omoheñóiva’ekue mokõi temimbo'ekue UW-peguare?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The text states: ""The Onion-gui oiko momarãndu ñeha'ã pukarã tuicha añetéva..."" which translates to ""From The Onion, they created a satirical newspaper...""
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui noĩri The Onion momarãndu ñeha'ã pukarã tuicha añetéva ryepýpe?","The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ web renda** (A website).

The text explicitly states: ""The Onion-gui oiko momarãndu ñeha'ã pukarã tuicha añetéva añetéva, oguerekóva kuatia ñenohẽ, **peteĩ web renda oguerekóva 5.000.000 puruhára jasypápe**..."" (The Onion created very satirical news stories, using satire, **a website with 5,000,000 visitors**...).

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'érepa oñatende tahachi kuera?","The correct answer is **C: Jeikeha guataha Downing**.

The text states: ""11:00 aravo riremi, tahachi kuera ojerure umi ava kuera ñe'ẽngurupe tojevy upe guataha rembere..."" which translates to ""At 11:00, the motorcade turns to escort the press to Downing Street...""

Therefore, the motorcade is turning to *Jeikeha guataha Downing* (go to Downing Street).
"

The text states: ""11:20 aravope, tahachi kuera ojerure umi ava kuera ñe'ẽngurupe tojevy upe guataha rembere..."" which translates to ""At 11:20, the motorcade stops and the people in the car are handed a letter...""

Mba’épa oĩ añeteguáva pe tapykueho ojapova’ekue Dr Ehud Ur ryepýpe?,"The correct answer is **A: Umi resultado ikatu oipytyvõ umi avakuérape oguerekóma va'ekue Tuguy Azuka tipo I-pe** (The results can help people who have type 1 diabetes).

Here's why:

* The text states that Dr. Ur and other experts believe that sugar intake can be harmful and that it's important for people with Type 1 Diabetes to manage their sugar intake. 
* The main point of the paragraph is that the research results *can help* people managing Type 1 Diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oĩ umi anguja oguerekovakuri Tuguy Azuka ha ko’ágã ndoguerekovéima Tuguy Azuka** (There are animals that produce sugar and, therefore, do not produce sugar): This statement is contradictory and not supported by the text.
* **C: Ha’e oguerovia umi mba'e ojejuhúva ikatuha oporomonguera** (He believes things that can cause proliferation): The text does not say Dr. Ur believes things that cause proliferation.  He's expressing concern about sugar intake and its potential harm.
* **D: Oĩ umi anguja ndoguerekóikuri Tuguy Azuka ha ko’ágã oguerekóma Tuguy Azuka** (There are animals that do not produce sugar and, therefore, produce sugar): This statement is also contradictory and not found in the text.

Here's why:

* The question asks what Dr. Ur *doesn't* believe.
* The text states that Dr. Ur believes it's important for people who have type 1 diabetes to have access to sugar.  The question then asks what he *doesn't* believe.
* Option A accurately reflects this: He doesn't believe that the things mentioned (presumably related to sugar consumption or availability) are important for people with Type 1 diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ikatúpa oñemonguera:**  The text doesn't mention whether he believes sugar *can* cause illness.
* **C: Umi ambue experto he'íva ñemonguera rehe:** The text mentions other experts *don't* believe sugar can cause illness, but it doesn't say Dr. Ur believes they do.
* **D: Umi anguja ndoguerekóiva Tuguy Azuka opytáta upéicha:** This refers to animals that *don't* have diabetes, which isn't relevant to Dr. Ur's belief about people with type 1 diabetes.

Mávapa ko’ã ñe’ẽ apytégui nomombe’uporãi pe accidente vuelo CG4684  rehegua?,"The correct answer is **B: Pe aviõ ho’a peteĩ tenda hasyetereihápe ojeike.** (The plane crashed in a very remote area.)

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Pe accidente oikoha ojejuhu ko árape ha hasyeteri ojeike hag̃ua upepeve..."" which translates to ""The accident was found today and it is very difficult to reach it..."" and then ""...upévare mokõi policía ojepoi upe ka’aguýpe oguata hag̃ua ohekakuévo tapicha ikatúva oikove."" which translates to ""...therefore two police officers went into the forest to see if people could find it.""

This indicates that the plane crashed in a remote, difficult-to-access location. The other options are not supported by the information in the text.
"
Mba'épa  omyañava'ekue ojeguejy pya'e hag̃ua pe vuelo CG4684 ?,"The correct answer is **D: Pe árarekovai (The terrain)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pe árarekovai omyañava’ekue ojeguejy pya’e hag̃ua avei omoñepysãnga tuicha jeporeka oñemboguatáva."" which translates to ""The terrain hinders the rapid search and rescue operation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe tenda jeguejyharãme ndaikatúi ojeike (The search area is not specified)** - While the text doesn't specify the search area, the terrain is directly mentioned as a problem.
* **B: Oĩkuri heta ambue aviõ CG4684 renondépe (There are many other airplanes in the CG4684 region)** - This is irrelevant to the search and rescue operation.
* **C: Pe aviõ oñemombiajey Kokoda gotyo (The plane was flying towards Kokoda)** -  This is factual information about the flight but doesn't explain why the search is slow.

"Oje’eháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa añetegua ko'ã mba'e oje'éva Franciszek Kowal experiencia rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Ojoka peteĩ apyka oñeha’ãvo osẽ hag̃ua** (He is joking about a window breaking when it's opened).

Here's why:

* The text states that Franciszek Kowal jokes about people opening windows and glass breaking.
* The question asks what the text suggests he is joking about, based on his experience.
* Option C directly reflects this: he's making a joke about a window breaking when opened.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amo ipahápe ndojehúi chupe mbaʼeve** (He is joking about something not being fixed). The text doesn't mention anything about something being broken or needing repair.
* **B: Amo ipahápe ndojehúi chupe mbaʼeve** (He is joking about something not being fixed). Same reasoning as A.
* **D: Oñehunga oñeha'ãvo ojoka peteĩ ovetã** (He is joking about a window breaking when it's opened). While related, option C is more precise because it specifically mentions ""a window"" breaking when opened, matching the text's description of people opening windows and glass breaking.

Mba'ére ijetu'u ojeikuaa hag̃ua mba'éichapa opokóta arapochy tropical Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Pe tormenta oĩ mombyry gueteri yvýgui** (The storm is moving over very warm water).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Arapochy oĩ rupi mombyry gueteri yvýgui, hasy gueteri ojeikuaa haguã mba'éichapa opokóta Estados Unidos ha Caribe rehe."" This translates to ""The storm is over very warm water, making it possible to see how it will affect the United States and the Caribbean.""

Option C directly reflects this information. The warmth of the water is a key factor in a tropical storm's development and intensification.
"
"Oje’eháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa umi mbaʼe ojeʼévagui pe Arapochy Tropical Danielle rehegua ndahaʼéi añetegua?","The correct answer is **C: Ikatu oiko chugui peteĩ huracán (It eventually became a hurricane)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Arapochy Renda Tetãgua he'i Danielle imbaretetaha huracán-pe ágã ararundýpe."" (The National Hurricane Center said Danielle would intensify into a hurricane within 36 hours.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndojekuaái mba'éichapa opoko Caribe rehe (It's unknown how it will affect the Caribbean).** The text *does* mention that the storm was moving towards the Caribbean and that they were trying to understand its potential impact.
* **B: Oñemoheñói Océano Atlántico-pe (It formed in the Atlantic Ocean).**  The text states that it *originated* in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
* **D: Hi'aguĩma yvýgui (It became stronger with the land).** The text says it was moving *over* the ocean and it was still developing. It didn't become stronger *with the land* at that point.

"Péicha he'i pe pehẽnguépe, mba'épa oje'e oikova'erãha mba'asýre omoheñói mboyve epidemia global?","The correct answer is **C: Oñembohasa va'erã hetave tapicha rehe (Spreads to many people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ambue estudio he'i upe mba'asy sa'ive oporojukakuaa va'erãha oiko mboyve chugui peteĩ epidemia global..."" This translates to: ""Another study says the danger is that it *can spread to many people* and cause a global epidemic...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sa'ive oporojukakuaa va'erãha (It can spread)** - This is a consequence of the main danger, but not the *cause* of a global epidemic.
*   **B: Sintoma-kuéra sa'íramo gueteri (Symptoms are very severe)** - While severe symptoms are a concern, the passage doesn't directly link them to causing a global epidemic.
*   **D: Mitãnguéra oguerekova’erã síntoma (People get symptoms)** -  This is a basic fact about illness, not the reason for a pandemic.



Therefore, the most accurate answer describing the danger that can lead to a global epidemic is the ability of the virus to spread to many people."
"Pe pehẽngue heʼiháicha, mboy mombyry piko Fujian-gui oĩ pe yvytu atã?","The correct answer is **B: 11 kilómetro**.

The question asks how far the wind traveled from Fujian. The text states: ""Oje’e peyvytu atã ohoha China gotyo once kilómetro peteĩ aravo aja."" which translates to ""It is said that the wind traveled eleven kilometers into China in one day.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oguahẽvo Singapur-pe (Upon arriving in Singapore):**  While he arrived in Singapore, the statement wasn't made immediately upon arrival. It was made later, during a specific event.
* **B: Wong Kan Seng ndive (With Wong Kan Seng):** He spoke to Wong Kan Seng, but the statement about the threat of terrorism wasn't made *during* that meeting.
* **D: Ára jeguata Asiare aja (On the second day of his trip to Asia):** The statement wasn't made on the second day in general; it was made during a specific event on that day.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the main/major result from the text? (Mávapa ko'ãva apytégui ha'e sãmbyhyha jehupytyrãguasu?)
* **The text states:** ""Marãndu ko aragua avei ombotuichave sãmbyhyha ñe'ẽme'ẽ ojejapova'ekue jasyapýpe ko arýpe oñehepyme'ẽ hag̃ua ambueve mba'yru."" (This research also allows for the development of a common language to be created in the cloud of this area by connecting different organisms.)
* **Option A directly reflects this central idea:** The creation of a common language *through the connection of different organisms in the cloud*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oñehepyme'ẽ 300 mba'yru** (Connecting 300 organisms): This is a specific number mentioned, but not the *main result*. It's a detail.
* **C: Ohupi 1.300-pe mba'yru retakue oñehepyme'ẽtava** (1300 organisms are connected): Similar to B, this is a specific number and detail, not the core result.
* **D: Ojoramie hag̃ua ojo'aripa ñeime mba'yrúpe** (To improve the mutual relationship of organisms): This describes a potential consequence, but not the main, overarching result of the research itself.



"
Mbaʼépa oikuaauka pe sãmbyhyha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ombosako’i ohepyme'ẽve hag̃ua 1300 mba’yru**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks:** What does the text state?
* **The text (P) states:** ""Ambueve 300 ohupi 1.300-pe mba'yru retakue oñehepyme'ẽtava ojoramie hag̃ua ojo'aripa ñeime."" (Out of 300 species, 1300 species are being connected/linked to the point of origin). This means the text says 1300 species are being connected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oplantea oñehepyme'ẽve haguã 300 mba’yru:** (States that 300 species are being connected). This is incorrect because the text mentions 1300 species are connected, not 300.
* **B: Oñe'ẽme'ẽ ojoramietaha mba'yru rehegua apañuãi:** (Speaks about the connection of species in a general way). While true, it doesn't specifically capture the core statement of the text.
* **D: Pe ojo'aripa ñeime mba'yrúpe oñemohu’ãta jasyapýpe:** (That the point of origin is being released in the forest). This refers to the forest and point of origin, not the number of connected species.



"
"Oje’eháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼe marandúpa ojekuaa?","The correct answer is **A: Upe amenaza nivel ñembosa'ive**.

Here's why:

* The question asks ""What is the key point/important thing understood (ojekuaa) in the statement?""
* The statement emphasizes that the threat level is ""ñembosa'ive"" (critical/extreme).  This is the central point the speaker is making.
* Option B (""Amenaza guasu opamaha"" - The great threat is coming) is a consequence of the critical level, but not the core understanding.
* Option C (""Oñeha'ãrõha peteĩ ataque"" - Intelligence was able to prevent an attack) is what the speaker *doesn't* believe happened, as stated by ""Ndaipóri inteligencia he´íva oñeha´ãrõha peteĩ ataque"".
* Option D (""Inteligencia omoañete pe ataque ivaitaha"" - Intelligence prevented the attack) is the opposite of what the speaker is saying.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is A, as it highlights the critical level of the threat, which is the main point of the statement.

Mba'e ñe’ẽasãi protesta-kuéra rehegua ndaha'éi añeteguáva?,"The correct answer is **A: Comisión mburuvichapegua ombohovái protesta-kuérape** (The commission investigates the protests).

Here's why:

* The question asks what *isn't* stated about the protests. 
* The text explicitly states that a commission investigates the protests (""Comisión mburuvichapegua ombohovái protesta-kuérape""). This is a factual statement.
* Options B, C, and D are all things that *are* stated in the text about the protests.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* stated is that the commission investigates the protests.
"
Mávapa he'i kuri CEP oĩ va'ekue osẽ va'erãha ?,"The correct answer is **C: Comisión mburuvichapegua** (The Oversight Commission).

The question asks who said that the CEP was going to be illegitimate. The text states: ""Comisión mburuvichapegua he'i kuri CEP oĩ va'ekue osẽba va'erãha peteĩ ojejapo va'erã apytépe omokyre'ỹ haguã jeiporavo pyahu tetãme."" which translates to ""The Oversight Commission said that the CEP was going to be illegitimate because it was formed without proper consultation regarding the organization of the elections in the country.""

Therefore, the Oversight Commission is the entity that declared the CEP illegitimate.

"Péicha he'i kuatia ñe'ẽ, mba'épa ndoykekói umi Gimnasta Estados Unidos pegua Nassar oiko rire abuso atleta-kuéra rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Jekuatia'o (Abuse)**.

The other options are related to the USOC's efforts to prevent abuse, but option A directly addresses the *abuse* itself.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Gimnasta Joaju Estados Unidos pegua ombojeko peteĩ jetypeka isãsova..."" which translates to ""The USA's top gymnast has created a safe system...""  The system is a *jetypeka isãsova*, meaning a safe system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tomohesakã mba'éichapa umi abuso ohasa vaekue Larry Nassar (Explains how Larry Nassar's abuse occurred):** While this is a significant part of the context, it's not the core of the *safe system* they are creating.
* **B: Oheka jekuatia’o (Avoids abuse):**  This is a consequence of the safe system, not what the system *is*.
* **D: Ohekávo peteĩ jeikoha oñemombareteva umi atleta-pe g̃uarã (Provides a system to empower athletes):**  Empowerment is a *benefit* of the system, but not the description of the system itself.

The text states: ""Un barco de contramedidas de minas Avenger rehegua, el barco oho hína kuri **Puerto Princesa gotyo Palawan-pe**."" This translates to: ""An Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship, the ship was traveling **to Puerto Princesa in Palawan**.""
"
Mbaʼépa ndahaʼéi peteĩ mbaʼe añeteguáva pe barco oñeñeʼẽva rehegua pe pehẽnguépe rehe?,"The correct answer is **B: Oguereko sede Palawan-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states the ship *hoína kuri Puerto Princesa gotyo Palawan-pe* (travelled to Puerto Princesa in Palawan).  It does *not* state that the ship *oguereko sede Palawan-pe* (has its headquarters in Palawan).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oho hína kuri Puerto Princesa gotyo:** The text explicitly says the ship traveled to Puerto Princesa.
* **C: Peteĩ barco de contramedidas de minas:** The text identifies the ship as an Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship.
* **D: Oñemomba’apo Séptima Flota de la Marina de los Estados Unidos-pe:** The text says the ship belongs to the US Navy's Seventh Fleet.



"
Mávapa he'i pe marandu oñe'ẽva Estados Unidos tropa kuera rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

"Péicha he’i marandúpe, mba'e tetã oñatendeta tahachiramo umi ojejagarra va'ekue rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Siria**.

The question asks where Turkey is preventing the captured militants from going. The text states: ""Turquia avei oñatendeta tahachiramo umi ISIS milicia kuerare ojejagarra vaekue,"" which translates to ""Turkey also is preventing the captured ISIS militants from going."" The text then goes on to say these militants are potentially heading towards Europe. Therefore, the militants are being prevented from going to **Syria** (where they were captured).
"
Mba'érepa oikókuri pe mba'e'aindýi?,"The correct answer is **C: Yvyty'aty ru'ãme (In the soil)**.

The text states: ""Pe mba'e'aindýi oikókuri yvyty'aty ru'ãme..."" which translates to ""The problem occurs in the soil...""
"
Mba'eichagua yvýpepa oiko pe mba'e'aindýi  ?,"The correct answer is **D: Yvyty'aty**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pe mba'e'aindýi oikókuri **yvyty'aty ru'ãme**..."" which translates to ""The valuable thing is only found **in the earth**...""

Therefore, the answer is Yvyty'aty (earth).
"
Mba'épa oha'ãrõ umi tembiguái pe yjapyhy rire?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe umi yvyku'ity toñemyatyrõjey** (The plants are being uprooted).

The passage states: ""ojupítarõ jepe sa'i pie yjapyhy rire, hi'ãnte tembiguáipe heta porã ojupi omyatyrõ hag̃ua umi yvyku'ity osoropáva ysyrýpe.""  This translates to: ""When a person steps on them, many plants that grow along the riverbank are uprooted in the water.""

Option A directly reflects this action of uprooting.  The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Toiko y rembe’y** (They make it watery/wet) - While the plants are in water, the primary action is uprooting.
* **C: Tahetave umi cacho corcovado** (They damage the Corcovado monkeys) - The passage doesn't mention anything about Corcovado monkeys being affected by the plants being stepped on.
* **D: Tahetave mymba saite rekoha** (They damage the delicate things) - This is too general and not specific to the action described.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui oafecta permanentemente pe y jokoha jejapo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tuguare ñemyasãi (Tuguare's pollination)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tuguare oñeikotevẽ va'ekue oiko hag̃ua chugui yvyku'ity ha y rembe'y, ha'éva mymba saite rekoha."" which translates to ""This tuguare is expected to produce small fruits and seeds, which are edible for birds.""

The question asks what *permanently* affects the bird's nesting. The passage emphasizes the tuguare's role in providing food (fruits and seeds) *for the birds* that nest there. Therefore, the availability of the tuguare's food source (its pollination and fruit production) is what permanently affects the birds' nesting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yvyku'ity (Plants):** While plants are involved, the passage focuses on the tuguare's influence on the birds' nesting, not just the plants in general.
*   **B: Cacho corcovado (Corcovado bird):** The passage mentions the Corcovado bird as an example of a species affected, but doesn't say it's a *permanent* effect on the bird's nesting. The effect is on the birds who *nest* in the tuguare.
*   **C: Mymba saite rekoha (Edible birds):** This is incorrect. The ""mymba saite rekoha"" are the *fruits*, not the birds themselves.

Therefore, the tuguare's pollination and subsequent fruit production are the most accurate answer because it directly provides a vital and *permanent* food source affecting the birds' ability to nest in the tuguare."
"Péicha he'i pe pehẽnguépe, máva omomarãndu Estados Unidos-pe oñemondoseha jejukarã mbokapurã?","The correct answer is **A: Umi churuchuchu apoha Somalia-gua**.

Here's why:

* The text states the US is working with Kenya and Ethiopia to build ""tenda oñemomba'eguasúva"" (shelters).
* The question asks *where* this cooperation happens regarding these shelters.
* The text explicitly mentions cooperation ""en Kenia ha Etiopía-pe"" (in Kenya and Ethiopia).

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Mbokapurã umi tenda oñemomba'eguasúva peteĩ tetãmegua (They cooperate on shelters in one country):** The text says cooperation is happening in *both* countries.
* **B: Mbokapurã mokõi tetãme (They cooperate in two countries):** While technically true, option C is more specific and accurate. It clarifies that the cooperation is specifically *on the shelters* in both countries.
* **D: Mbokapurã peteĩ tetãme (They cooperate in one country):** This is directly contradicted by the text.



"
Mávapa ko'ã tapicha apytégui ndaha'éi mo'ãhára?,"The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

The text explicitly states: ""peteĩ sarambi tuichava tekoha hekopegua Griego apytepe oiko kuri ojechaukavo mba'epao hekopegua'ỹva, mo'ãhára kuera, fiscal kuera, defensor kuera ojapo vaekue hina umi ary kuera mboyvepe.

This clearly indicates that Petros Mantouvalos is accused of corruption. The other options (Sakis Kechagioglou, George Nikolakopoulos, and Makis Triantafylopoulos) are mentioned as being involved in the corruption case, but the text identifies *Petros Mantouvalos* as the one who was accused of the specific act of taking bribes.

Máva ava kuera ndoje'éi oĩha  peteĩ sarambi tuichava tekoha hekopegua Griego apytepe?,"The correct answer is **A: Mo'ãhára kuera (Prosecutors)**.

The text states: ""Ha peva rupive, peteĩ sarambi tuichava tekoha hekopegua Griego apytepe oiko kuri ojechaukavo mba'epao hekopegua'ỹva, **mo'ãhára kuera**, fiscal kuera, defensor kuera ojapo vaekue hina ary kuera mboyvepe.""

This translates to: ""And as a result, a significant financial penalty was imposed on a Greek company for the illegal activities, which **prosecutors**, fiscal officers, and defense officers had to take action on over the years.""

Therefore, prosecutors (mo'ãhára kuera) were responsible for dealing with the penalty.
"
Mboy yvýpa itapykue India?,"The correct answer is **A: 11**.

The question asks ""Mboy yvýpa itapykue India?"" which translates to ""How many wickets did India lose?"".

The text states: ""Itapykuerire upe capitan terrenope, India apena ojapo 36 ñani ha itapykue 7 entradape omohu'ã haguã umi entrada kuera."" This translates to ""In the innings, the captain of the ground, India scored 36 runs and lost 7 wickets.""
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mboýpa umi ijyvateveva jeike puntaje?","The correct answer is **A: 70 jeñani**.

The question states: ""Robert Uthappa ojapo kuri ijyvateveva jeike puntaje, 70 jeñani..."" which translates to ""Robert Uthappa scored the highest score, 70 runs...""
"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaha’éi peteĩ mba’e omoñepyrũva Adam Cuerden po'a'ỹ?,"The correct answer is **A: Política pyahucontenido meña rehegua upe sitiope**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Umi tekohagua kuera pochy ogueraha kuri upe ñeha'ã ko'agãguape ojehai haguã peteĩ politica contenido meña rehegua upe sitiope oguerekova heta sua medio kuera ilicencia abiertoiteva.""  This translates to: ""These young people criticize this phenomenon in this context of having a political content on the site with many open-licensed media.""

This directly identifies political content as the issue being criticized. The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gales-pegua arte ñembogue:** While Adam Cuerden is from Wales and seems to have a background in editing, the criticism isn't specifically about his Welsh background.
* **C: Nohendúi chupe Gales:** The passage says he *is* from Wales.
* **D: Umi japu oje’éva pe arte ñembogue rehegua:** While young people are involved, the passage focuses on the *content* of their edits, not specifically on *who* is doing the editing.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa oñembogue pe sitio-gui?","The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ apopyrã política rehegua (A specific political content)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umi tekohagua kuera pochy ogueraha kuri upe ñeha'ã ko'agãguape ojehai haguã peteĩ politica contenido meña rehegua upe sitiope oguerekova heta sua medio kuera ilicencia abiertoiteva.""

This translates to: ""These poor people are upset that this issue is being uploaded to the site with a specific political content, where many media outlets with open licenses are available.""

Therefore, the website is being used to publish **specific political content**.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼã mbaʼe apytégui Amir Khan ndoykekói?","The correct answer is **C: Umi kuña remiandu (His competitors' wives)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Amo hapópe, vaicha chéve kuñanguéra noñorairõi va’erãha. Upéva che remiandu.” This translates to: ""I am very happy, my head is that my wives won't be bothered. That is my worry.""  He's expressing concern *about his competitors' wives* potentially causing problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuñanguéra ñorãirõhára jegueroike Juegos Olímpicos-pe (The winning of women at the Olympic Games):**  While related to women, the text is specifically about the *competitors' wives*, not the women winning.
* **B: Umi competidor británico (The British competitor):** The text mentions a British competitor, but the core of Amir Khan's concern is related to the wives of competitors in general.
* **D: Londres omotenonde hag̃ua Juegos Olímpicos (London hosting the Olympic Games):** This is irrelevant to the passage.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'épa oykekota Amir Khan jepéramo oguereko hemiandu?  ","The correct answer is **A: Oñemoneĩ kuña aty jegueroike Juegos Olímpicos-pe**.

The text states: ""Pe medallista de plata olímpico 2004 arýpe guare, Amir Khan, he’i: “Amo hapópe, vaicha chéve kuñanguéra noñorairõi va’erãha. Upéva che remiandu”"" which translates to ""The 2004 Olympic silver medalist, Amir Khan, said: “I'm ashamed, my parents won't be offended. That's my shame.”""

The sentence immediately following explains the context: ""Jepéramo oikuaauka hemiandu, he’i oykekotaha umi competeidor británico-pe Juegos Olímpicos 2012 arepegua oikóta Londres-pe."" which translates to ""And it was discovered that he had brought his girlfriend to the 2012 Olympic Games in London.""

Therefore, Amir Khan's shame is because he **brought his girlfriend to the Olympic Games**. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they refer to things that are mentioned later in the text and aren't the reason for his initial shame as stated.



"
Araka'épa omano Peter Lenz?,"The correct answer is **C: Tasyópe**.

The text states: ""ojegueraha chupe tasyópe upe rire omanohaguépe"" which translates to ""he was taken to the hospital, but he died despite it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojere ñepyrũ aja calentamiento-pe** (At the beginning of the warm-up): This describes *when* the accident happened, not *how* he died.
* **B: Ho’a rire bicicleta-gui** (After falling off his motorcycle): This describes the *initial event* of the accident, not the cause of death.
* **D: Personal médico pista-pe oĩva rehe** (By the medical personnel on the track): This is incorrect. The medical personnel tried to help him, but they couldn't prevent his death.



"
Mávapa Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ personal médico**.

The text states: ""Lenz ho'a bicicleta-gui ha upéi ombeti hese iñirũ ñañanihapegua **Xavier Zayat**, **personal médico pista-pe oĩva**.""  This directly translates to ""Lenz crashed from the bike and then collided with **Xavier Zayat, who was track medical personnel**.""
"
Mbaʼe kásopepa oiméne ideprovéchota peteĩ piloto ojepyʼapývape oentende porãramo mbaʼéichapa ombaʼapo peteĩ aviõ hyepýpe?,"The correct answer is **B: Pe kyhyje orekóva hikuái oveve hag̃ua oñecentráramo peteĩ kyhyje ojekuaa’ỹva rehe** (The passenger, when seated, focuses on a clearly visible wing).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** When can a pilot's understanding of aircraft operation be best utilized? This implies a situation where the pilot's knowledge is *most helpful*.
* **Option B** describes a specific action a passenger can take – focusing on a wing. This allows the pilot to gauge the passenger's understanding and provide relevant explanations or reassurance.  The pilot can see if the passenger is paying attention to a critical aspect of the aircraft.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Pe pasajero otĩramo okyhyje rupi** (The passenger gets on the plane) - This is too general.  It doesn't specify a situation where the pilot's knowledge is particularly valuable.
    * **C: Pe pasajero okyhyjérõ opaichagua transporte-gui** (The passenger gets on from any mode of transport) - Again, too general and doesn't relate to the pilot's helpfulness.
    * **D: Ijepy’apy oúramo umi mba’e vaieterei ohasava’ekuegui ha ndojoajúiva jeveve rehe** (During the flight, by observing the things that are visible and without getting bored) - This describes a general flight experience, but doesn't pinpoint a specific time when the pilot's knowledge is most useful.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ojapova’erã peteĩ viajero oñakãngetáva pe hepykue rehe?","The correct answer is **B: Ejapo pe reserva directamente umi aerolínea ndive** (Make the reservation directly with the airline).

Here's why:

The problem states that airlines are offering lower prices and making it easier to book directly through their websites.  Option B directly aligns with this information.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Eheka umi oferta heta empresa de viajes-pe (Check offers on many travel agencies):** While this *was* a common practice, the text emphasizes booking *directly* with the airline now.
* **C: Embojoja hepykue heta empresa de viajes apytépe (Compare flights on many travel agencies):** Similar to A, this implies using a travel agency, which is being countered by the direct booking option.
* **D: Ejesareko pe aerolínea web renda (Use the airline's website):** While this is a valid option, it's not the *most* direct or comprehensive answer to the question of what a traveler should do *given* the context of airlines offering better deals directly.

Therefore, booking directly with the airline is the best and most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ojaporaẽvaʼerã umi viajero ikatu hag̃uáicha oasegura umi vuelo ndahepyguasúiva?","The correct answer is **C: Ejapo pe reserva directamente umi aerolínea rupive (Make the reservation directly with the airline).**

Here's why:

The question asks how travelers can ensure their flights are not canceled. The paragraph states that airlines offer more safety when bookings are made directly through their website.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ejesareko pe aerolínea web renda (Use the airline's website):** While using the airline's website is *part* of the solution, the paragraph implies a direct booking is best, not just browsing.
* **B: Ombojoja hepykue opaichagua agregador apytépe (Use any aggregator):** Aggregators (like Expedia, Kayak, etc.) don't offer the same direct control or reliability as booking directly.
* **D: Ejapo reserva directamente peteĩ agente de viajes ndive (Make the reservation directly with a travel agent):** While a travel agent can help, the paragraph emphasizes the airline's website as the primary way to ensure safety.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate response based on the information provided.
"
Araka’épa ojejerure peteĩ irũ omoirũ hag̃ua peteĩ ñeme’ẽ?,"The correct answer is **A: Oñemondóvo umi mba'e flete aviõ rupive (When the cargo is arranged for air freight)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks when a shipment is initially arranged. The text describes companies arranging shipping quickly, often for time-sensitive items. This initial arrangement happens when the cargo is being planned for air transport.
* Options B, C, and D describe later stages of the shipping process:
    * B: This refers to the airline handling the cargo, which happens *after* the initial arrangement.
    * C: This refers to checked baggage, which is a specific type of cargo and not the general initial arrangement.
    * D: This refers to using a third-party company, which is a specific strategy *within* the arrangement process, not the initial arrangement itself.

Therefore, **A** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, reiporavóramo peteĩ aerolínea evevejepiha peteĩ alianza-pe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui remotenondeva’erã?","The best answer is **A: Pe aerolínea oikuave'ẽva hetave punto (The airline earns many points)**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks what benefits an airline receives when joining an alliance.
* **The first statement (P)** mentions the possibility of financial advantages, particularly regarding the privileges associated with the alliance and the benefits for passengers.
* **Option A** directly addresses a key benefit airlines get from alliances: earning frequent flyer points. This is a fundamental aspect of airline alliances and a significant motivator for joining.
* **Option B** is too broad. Being in an alliance *is* the starting point, but it doesn't describe a specific benefit.
* **Option C** is too general. It just restates the initial premise.
* **Option D** is partially correct, but ""many privileges"" (referring to passengers) is a consequence of the alliance, not a direct benefit *to* the airline itself.  While airlines *gain* benefits through passenger loyalty, the primary benefit they receive is often through points, code-sharing, and other operational advantages.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and relevant answer."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ikatu oikuave’ẽ hetave punto oviaja py’ỹivévape?","The correct answer is **C: Ne aerolínea evevejepiha peteĩ alianza iñambuévape**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""How many points will I be able to earn when traveling by plane?"" referring back to the initial statement in question (P) about a potential alliance.
* **Question (P) states:** ""Eiporavo porãva’erã nde aerolínea evevejepiha peteĩ alianza-pe."" This translates to ""If our airline joins an alliance...""
* **The answer (C) directly reflects this:** ""Ne aerolínea evevejepiha peteĩ alianza iñambuévape"" means ""When our airline joins an alliance.""  This is the closest and most accurate phrasing to answer the question about earning points *when the airline joins the alliance*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ aerolínea iñambuéva peteĩ alianza iñambuévape:** This translates to ""An airline that is joining an alliance."" While related, it doesn't directly address *your* airline joining and the resulting points.
* **B: Ne aerolínea evevejepiha peteĩchagua alianza poguypegua:**  This translates to ""Your airline joins a *low-cost* alliance."" Question P doesn't mention a low-cost alliance.
* **D: Peteĩ aerolínea iñambuéva peteĩ alianza ryepýpe:** This translates to ""An airline joining an alliance *group*.""  This is less specific and doesn't directly link to *your* airline and points earned.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa umi tete’anduha koʼãva apytégui ikatu oñembyai ojeʼuetereíramo pe alcohol?","The correct answer is **C: Ñeikũmby**.

Here's why:

* **Ñeikũmby** means ""to investigate"" or ""to inquire."" The question asks how the authorities investigate alcohol production to prevent illegal alcohol from being made.  ""Investigate"" is the most fitting action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñehendu** means ""to understand"" or ""to comprehend."" While understanding the dangers is important, it's not the action the authorities take.
* **B: Jehecha** means ""to watch"" or ""to observe."" While observation might be part of the process, it's not the core investigative action.
* **D: Ñehetũ** means ""to test"" or ""to examine."" While testing the alcohol might happen as part of an investigation, the question asks about the overall investigative process.



Therefore, **Ñeikũmby (to investigate)** is the most appropriate response to the question."
"Ojeʼe haguéicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ikatu omboguejy umi mbaʼe vai ojapóva pe alcohol?","The correct answer is **B: Uje'úramo umi alcohol ojejapo va'ekue ilegalmente**.

The text explicitly states: ""peligro tuichavéva hína uje'úramo umi alcohol ojejapo va'ekue ilegalmente. Licor ilegal.kuéra oguerekokuaa heta mba'e ky'a peligroso-va..."" which translates to ""it is very dangerous to consume alcohol that is produced illegally. Illegal liquor contains many dangerous things...""

Option B directly reflects this statement.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oje’u alcohol metanol ndive** (It's said alcohol contains methanol): While methanol can be a dangerous contaminant, the text focuses on the *illegal production* of alcohol as the primary concern.
*   **C: Hey'u sa'imi umi bebida alcohólica** (It says to drink alcoholic beverages): This is the opposite of the text's warning.
*   **D: Oje’u opaichagua tapicha ndive** (It's said by everyone):  The text doesn't claim that everyone says this; it's a general warning based on the dangers of illegal alcohol.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the status of the buildings in the canal district in relation to the UNESCO World Heritage status.** The passage states the Canal District *is* a UNESCO World Heritage site.
* **Option B accurately reflects this relationship:**  ""Oimeraẽ tendápe ojeporavóva Patrimonio de la Humanidad-ramo, UNESCO rehe"" translates to ""It is included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Upe Canal Distrito (holandés-pe: Grachtengordel)** - This simply restates the name of the district; it doesn't answer the question about the buildings' status.
* **C: Umi tenda ojeipe'áva Binnenstad-gui** -  ""The houses are removed from Binnenstad"" is incorrect and not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Umi tenda oñemomba’eguasúva tembiasakuérupi** - ""The houses are being renovated to historical standards""  While likely true to some extent, the passage doesn't focus on renovations, but rather the *status* of the district as a UNESCO site.



"
"Mba’érepa ojeporavo upe Canal Distrito Patrimonio de la Humanidad-ramo, UNESCO rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Oñemomba’eguasúgui tembiasakue ha arandupyrupi (Because of its historical and cultural significance)**.

The text states: ""Upe tavusu ojehechakuaa Patrimonio de la Humanidad-ramo, UNESCOrehe hembiasa porãmby ha arandupy ijojaha’ỹva..."" which translates to ""The district is recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its outstanding historical and cultural significance...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha'égui tenda ijojaha'ỹva (It is a residential area):** While there are houses in the Canal District, its significance goes beyond just being residential.
* **C: Ha’égui tenda ojeréva Binnenstad rehe (It is a house located in Binnenstad):** The Canal District is *part of* Binnenstad, but being in Binnenstad doesn't automatically make it a World Heritage Site.
* **D: Ha'égui yvyvy vore hepykue (It is a network of canals):** The canals themselves are important, but the UNESCO recognition is for the entire historical and cultural *district*, not just the canals.

The text explicitly states: ""Ko tendápe jeho aja ikatu avei ojeho peteĩ barco-pe pe lago rupive."" which translates to ""You can also get there by boat from the lake.""  Option B is incorrect because the text mentions needing an Angkor Pass to enter the temple, not to get there. Options C and D are not mentioned in the provided text.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ojejerure umi ohóvape oike hag̃ua Phnom Krom-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Ojupívo ohasa Yasovarman templo** (When you arrive, you pass through the Yasovarman temple).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko templo oĩva peteĩ colina ru’ãme opávo, rey Yasovarman omanda aja."" (This temple is on a hill built during the reign of King Yasovarman.)  And further: ""Angkor Pass katuete oñeikotevẽ ojeike hag̃ua pe templo-pe"" (The Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple).  This implies that entering Phnom Krom involves passing through the Yasovarman temple *after* getting through the Angkor Pass.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Oviaja Siem Reap rupi** (Travels to Siem Reap) - Phnom Krom is *near* Siem Reap, but arriving there doesn't automatically involve traveling to Siem Reap.
*   **C: Ojehupyty hag̃ua Angkor Pass** (Obtains an Angkor Pass) - While you *need* an Angkor Pass to enter Phnom Krom, the text doesn't say you simply ""obtain"" it. It's a requirement upon entering.
*   **D: Ojeho hag̃ua ygape Tonle Sap jerére** (Goes by boat on Tonle Sap lake) -  You *can* go by boat, but that's not the primary action of arriving.  The text mentions the option of taking a boat, not that it's the standard way people arrive.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa koʼãva apytégui ikatu ojoko peteĩ turístape ani hag̃ua oho Antártica-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ presupuesto tuicha viajerã (A large budget for travel)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that traveling to Antarctica is expensive:

*  ""Turista kuéra jeju hepy hina..."" (Tourists have to pay...)
*  ""...oje limita hina pe Peninsula renda pe, Isla kuéra ha Yguasu Ross pe."" (...limited to the Peninsula, Islands, and Ross Ice Shelf.) This implies logistical costs.
*  ""...hetave umi tendape; pe ara ro'y pe opyta sa'ive."" (...many bases; the sun doesn't set.)  This highlights the remote location and logistical challenges.
*  ""...sapy'ante arapytu especialista kuéra oho imbytepe, ojupy yvyty guasure terã ohupyty pe polo, oimehape peteĩ base tuichava."" (...satellite specialists go to the ice, precisely measuring the ice to reach the pole, and establish a large base.) This points to sophisticated and expensive equipment and operations.

While options B, C, and D *could* present challenges, they aren't the primary reason for the *high cost* of visiting Antarctica, which is the focus of the text.  A large budget is the most direct and obvious barrier for most tourists.



"
Peteĩ turista oguerohorýva yvyty jejupi mba’e tendaAntárticape-guápe ikatu oho?,"The correct answer is **C: Península-pe** (On the Peninsula).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Peteĩ mokõi su ávakuéra oiko ape arahaku jave irundy docena kuéra basepe, ha hetave umi tendape; pe ara ro'y pe opyta sa'ive.""  This translates to ""Two or three countries have established dozens of bases, and many tents; the sun sets before the outpost.""  The phrase ""pe ara ro'y pe opyta sa'ive"" (the sun sets before the outpost) suggests the outpost is located on the peninsula, as it's the furthest point from the Equator and experiences the longest periods of darkness.  It also directly links bases and tents to the peninsula.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe Ross Yguasúpe (On the Ross Ice Shelf):** While the Ross Ice Shelf is mentioned as a border, it's not where the bases and tents are located.
* **B: Pe tenda mbyte (On the ice tents):** The text says many tents are used, but it doesn't indicate tourists *go* to the tents themselves. They are a part of the base infrastructure.
* **D: Umi isla (On the islands):** The text mentions islands as part of the border, but doesn't link tourists specifically to the islands.



"
Moõpa sa’ive oĩ peteĩ observatorio ipyahu nungámava?,"The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ tenda mombyryhápe (In a very dark building)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hetave umi telescopio tembikuaareka rehegua ko’ag̃aguáva ha’e temimoĩmby tuichaitereíva tenda mombyryetereíva..."" which translates to ""However, the telescopes related to astronomical observations are greatly benefited by a very dark building..."" 

Options A, B, and D are incorrect. The text emphasizes the importance of a dark environment for astronomical observation, directly pointing to a ""very dark building"" as ideal.
"
Moõpa oñemohendáne peteĩ telescopio tembikuaareka rehegua ko’ag̃aguáva?,"The correct answer is **D: Tuichaitereíva tenda**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hetave umi telescopio tembikuaareka rehegua ko’ag̃aguáva ha’e temimoĩmby tuichaitereíva tenda mombyryetereíva ha oguereko condición atmosférica iporãva.""

Translation: ""However, astronomical telescopes are greatly improved by having a very high observatory and good atmospheric conditions.""

Option D directly reflects this statement. The other options are mentioned as *places* where the observatory *might* be located (observatory ipyahu nungámava, campus-hárupi, tekombo’e rendáramo), but the passage emphasizes the importance of a *high observatory* (tuichaitereíva tenda) for optimal performance.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’e tendápa iporãvéta peteĩ ára ojehasaséva yrembe’ýpe kirirĩháme?","The correct answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The text describes St Heliers as a beach with safe swimming and a beautiful view of the harbor, located on Tamaki Drive, above Bahía Mission and closer to Auckland Central.  It explicitly states that beaches on Tamaki Drive are ""heta oguereko ñemuha pe y rembe'ýpe"" (have many facilities for recreation) and ""jeyta iseguro"" (are safe).

While other options are mentioned, the text gives St Heliers the most positive description regarding safe swimming and recreational facilities, making it the best choice for a relaxing day at the beach.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, moõpa oiméne ikatu ojeyta segurove?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport-pe**.

This directly indicates that beaches in Devonport are safe.

"Ojevisita aja pe tenda oñemombeʼúva pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼã mbaʼe apytégui ojehecháta naiporãiha?","The correct answer is **A: Ojeactuávo solemnemente (Act solemnly)**.

Here's why:

The text describes the site as a ""fosa común"" (mass grave) and a house that was a ""refuge for people fleeing and hiding from the world."" It specifically mentions the victims were Jewish and ""Jewish-derived"" and that the site is maintained with ""solemnity and respect.""

Therefore, when people visit, they would act in a solemn manner out of respect for the victims and the historical significance of the place.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ojehejávo peteĩ marca pe tenda jerére (By placing a mark on the house's name)** - While marking the name might be part of remembrance, the text doesn't emphasize a physical mark on the building itself.
*   **C: Ojejapóvo ñembosarái (By holding a ceremony)** - Ceremonies *could* be held, but the text primarily emphasizes the solemn *act* itself, not necessarily a specific ceremony.
*   **D: Oñekarãirõ peteĩ mba’e tendapegua (By placing something on the site)** - The text explicitly states that the site is *not* adorned or embellished."
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui omombe’u lingua francas rehegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Gua'úva (Borrowed)**.

Here's why:

The text states that lingua francas are ""ñe’ẽ rapo orgánica-va oikova ichugui dominante taha’e"" which translates to ""a borrowed language that is dominant among others.""  This directly corresponds to the idea that a lingua franca is a language borrowed or adopted for communication between people who don't share a native language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndaha’éiva natural (Not natural):** While lingua francas are often not the native language of anyone involved, the text doesn't focus on their naturalness or lack thereof.
* **C: Oñembohetepyva’ekue (Overlapping/Intertwined):** While languages can overlap, this doesn't describe the *origin* of a lingua franca.
* **D: Heñóiva ijeheguirei (Enforces hierarchy):**  The text doesn't explicitly mention hierarchy, although the dominance of the lingua franca can *lead* to hierarchy. However, the definition centers on the *borrowed* nature.

Here's why:

The question asks what the *purpose* of lingua francas is. The passage states that lingua francas are natural languages that become dominant for the purpose of communication between people who don't share a common language.  Option D accurately reflects this: ""It is a language created to facilitate communication among all spoken languages.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha’e ñe’ẽ rapo orgánica-va ojeporúva oñembohape hag̃ua ñomongeta tapichakuéra apytépe ikatúva ndojokupytýi ambue hendáicha** (It is an organically developed language that can be used to shape relationships among people and cannot be replaced by others) - While lingua francas *can* shape relationships, the main purpose isn't about replacement, but about enabling communication.
* **B: Ha’e umi ñe’ẽ heñóiva ijeheguirei ha avei oñembohetepyva’ekue** (It is a language that is always evolving and also being modified) - This describes language in general, not specifically the function of a lingua franca.
* **C: Ha’e ha’ehína umi ñe’ẽ oñembohetepyva’ekue oñemyatyrõ hag̃ua umi káso hasyhápe ojejekupyty oñondive** (It is a language that is modified when dealing with complex cases and is used to solve problems) - This is too specific and doesn't capture the broad communicative function of a lingua franca.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ohechavaʼerã peteĩ pasajero pe icrucero ha’étaramo roʼy tiémpope?","The correct answer is **B: Visa rehegua ojejeruréva** (Visa issues).

Here's why:

The question asks what a passenger might encounter on the cruise if they are delayed. The text states: ""Crucero pasajero-kuéra ndoikotevẽi visa rehe (eporandu mbojojahakuéra)"" which translates to ""Cruise passengers are not allowed without a visa (information from the authorities).""  Therefore, a delay would likely be due to visa problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabina ñemohenda (Cabin damage):** The text doesn't mention cabin damage as a potential problem.
* **C: Mbojojahakuéra (Authorities):** While the authorities are involved in visa issues, the delay *itself* is more directly related to the visa.
* **D: Pe aravo oñeimétava upe távape (The ship is not allowed in that country):** The text doesn't suggest the ship being denied entry. It specifically says passengers are not allowed without a visa.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, peteĩ pe pasajero ohóramo crucero-pe arahaku jave, mba’éguipa ikatúne ojehekýi hikuái?","The correct answer is **C: Visa rehegua ojejeruréva** (Due to visa requirements).

Here's why:

The question asks why a passenger might be prevented from boarding a cruise to San Petersburg, even though they don't need a visa (according to the cruise company). The text states that the cruise passengers are *not* required to have visas (according to the cruise company). This implies the reason for denial is something *other than* a visa issue.

The text also mentions ice and rescue efforts. While these are potential concerns related to the itinerary, they wouldn't directly prevent a passenger from boarding if they meet all other requirements. 

Therefore, the most likely reason is some other condition or regulation requiring a visa is still being enforced by authorities, despite the cruise company's statement.



"
Mba’érepa ojeporueterei catalán ojejapo hag̃ua señalética ha marandu Barcelona-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ha'eva'ekue upe táva ñe'ẽ tee peteĩha** (It is because Catalan is the official language of the city).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Barcelona ñe’ẽ tee tee ha’e hína catalán ha castellano"" (Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish). This means Catalan is the primary language of the city.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ojekuaave rupi castellano-gui** (It's to avoid Spanish) - This is not supported by the text. The text highlights the official status of Catalan.
    * **C: Aimete la mitad hetakuégui oñe’ẽ catalán Barcelona-pe** (Half the population speaks Catalan in Barcelona) - While this is true, it doesn't explain *why* Catalan is used for signage and communication.
    * **D: Mba'yrumyipuku ha ambue tenda oñeimeha oiporuve umi oñe'ẽva catalán** (Restaurants and other shops use those who speak Catalan) -  This is not the reason Catalan is used; it's more about the official language status.



"
Mávapa ko’ã ñe’ẽ apytégui ojeiporu sistema de Metro Barcelona-peguápe marandu jepiveguarã?,"The correct answer is **A: Inglés ñe’ẽ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...umi interrupción oñembohape’ỹva oñemomarandu peteĩ sistema automatizado rupive heta ñe’ẽme, umíva apytépe español, inglés, francés, árabe ha japonés."" This translates to: ""...the interruptions are announced via an automated system in many languages, among them Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.""

Therefore, English is one of the languages used in the automated announcement system of the Barcelona Metro.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ã comodidad apytégui ndaha’emo’ãiomotenondéva peteĩ bed ha breakfast de lujo-va?","The correct answer is **A: Umi mba’e ojeiporúva plato heve g̃uarã** (The provision of delicious food).

Here's why:

The question asks what comfort *cannot* be found in a luxury bed and breakfast, based on the description. The description explicitly states that luxury B&Bs focus on two main things: the location and the food. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mueble yma guare tuja ijojaha’ỹva** (Comfortable furniture): The description mentions furniture, so this *is* a comfort.
* **C: Umi tenda okapegua oñeñangareko porãva hese** (Well-maintained gardens): The description mentions well-maintained gardens, so this *is* a comfort.
* **D: WiFi pya’e** (Fast WiFi): The description doesn't mention WiFi, but it doesn't say it's *not* available. It's possible, but not a core element emphasized in the description.  The emphasis is on food and location.

Therefore, the only element the description highlights as a core focus (and therefore something that *might not* be present or emphasized in all luxury B&Bs) is the provision of delicious food.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaha’éi peteĩ mba’e oñemotenondetereíva umi B&B de lujo apytépe?","The correct answer is **B: Opaichagua rambosarã araitepegua ñeikuave’ẽmby (Unusual car with a welcoming gesture)**.

Here's why:

The text describes luxurious B&Bs focusing on two main things: the apartment itself and the car/welcome amenities.  Option B directly relates to the second point – a car with a welcoming gesture is presented as something *unusual* and a noteworthy element, highlighting what distinguishes these B&Bs from standard ones.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mbojeguaka ko'ag̃agua (The apartment itself)** - While the apartment is important, the text already mentions it.  The question asks what makes *these* B&Bs luxurious *beyond* just the apartment.
* **C: Tupa ao iporãvéva (The beautiful apartment)** - Again, this is a description already present in the text.
* **D: Tembi’u ha ñemboy’urã ojejapóva upe tetãme (The crafts and decorations made in the country)** - This is a detail, but it's not presented as a unique or distinguishing feature in the text compared to other B&Bs.

The text states: ""Beijing China-gua táva hína oĩta jeguerovy'a guahẽ..."" which translates to ""Beijing China-gua táva hína oĩta ski jumping...""  This indicates that ski jumping was one of the sports held in Beijing during the 2022 Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Taizicheng-pegua tenda esquí rehegua aty (Taizicheng ski jump facilities):**  While Taizicheng hosted the ski jumping events, the question asks what *event* was held in Beijing itself.
* **C: Umi aty ipahápegua (The sports that are played):** This is too general. The question is looking for a specific sport.
* **D: Umi mba’e ojejapóva hielo-pe techo guýpe (The things that are done on ice roofs):**  This refers to ice sports, but the text specifies ski jumping was done on the ice.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko'ãva apytégui omotenondéta Beinjing ary 2022-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Umi Olimpiada arahakupegua (The Winter Olympics)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Beijing China-gua táva hína oĩta Olimpiada Ñembosarái Araro'ypegua rendáramo 2022-pe, upéva omohendáta chupe táva peteĩha ojejapohaguépe Olimpiada arahaku ha araro'ypegua."" which translates to ""Beijing China hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.""

Therefore, the answer is about the Winter Olympics.

Mávapa oguereko tuichave iriesgo ojapyhývo gripe aviar?,"The correct answer is **C: Umi mba’apohára corral-pegua mymba ovevevakuéra ndive (People who work with poultry)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Hetave hasýva oĩ yvypóra omba’apóva corral-pegua mymba ovevevakuéra ndive, ha avei oĩ riesgo umi corral-pegua mymba observador."" (However, there is concern about people who work with poultry, and there is also a risk to people who observe poultry.)
* **Option C directly reflects this statement.** Those working directly with poultry are at the highest risk of contracting avian influenza.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Guyrakuéra rechahára (Poultry owners):** While poultry owners are at risk, the text focuses more on *people who work with* poultry, not necessarily just owners.
* **B: Tapichakuéra omba’apóva mymba okambúva ndive (People who have poultry at home):** This is a risk, but generally less than those who work with poultry.
* **D: Tapichakuéra oguerekomava’ekue pe mba’asy ymave (People who have very weak immune systems):** While a weak immune system *can* increase risk, the text doesn't highlight this as the primary concern. The main focus is on direct contact with poultry.

Here's why:

* The question asks what the information *effectively* conveys about avian flu.
* Option B directly states that cases of human infection from birds have been found. This is a key piece of information about the danger of avian flu.
* While options A, C, and D contain *some* truth, they are less impactful and don't fully capture the main point conveyed in the original text.
    * A: is too narrow. It just mentions being near birds.
    * C: is a potential risk, but less important than the fact that infections *have already occurred*.
    * D: is not directly stated in the text. The text doesn't say the cases are definitively human infections, only that there are reports.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and effective summary of the information provided.
"
Mba’épa Mar Blanco Báltico Canal ombojoaju?,"The correct answer is **C: Océano Ártico ha Mar Báltico**.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'éichagua vehículo-pe ikatu oñembyaty pasaporte ani hag̃ua oñeinterrumpi pe pasajero-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Umi aviõ (Airplanes)**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""Peteĩ inmigración ñeñangareko renda ha'e jepi pe jepyta peteĩha ojeguejývo peteĩ avión..."" (An immigration process is carried out upon entering the country by water, land, or other means... a plane).  The following sentence explains that passports aren't checked on airplanes.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the text explicitly mentions passport checks on trains (B and D) and doesn't mention anything about airplanes having passports checked.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, araka’épa ikatu ojejerure ojehecha hag̃ua ne identificación umi tren fronterizo-peguápe?","The correct answer is **C: Nojejapói inspección (Inspection takes place)**.

Here's why:

The text states that border trains have customs officials who **inspect passports** at certain points.  Option C directly reflects this inspection process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojeguejy rire tren-gui (When getting off the train):** While you might be inspected when disembarking, the text doesn't explicitly say that's *when* the inspection happens.
* **B: Reke aja (Anytime):** The text doesn't indicate random inspections.
* **D: Pe tren oho aja (When the train is moving):**  It's highly unlikely they would be inspecting passports while the train is in motion.

Here's why:

The question asks what kind of flora (plants) can be recreated in Singapore, given its location in the ""tropical zone"" between the equator and northern regions. The text states that this location supports a large variety of rainforest plants. Therefore, the ability to recreate multiple rainforest species is the most accurate answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Reñemonda (We will not be able to)** - The text implies it *is* possible, just that it requires recreating a diverse ecosystem.
*   **B: Ndojeikekuaái ñemuháme (We cannot decide)** - The text provides information to suggest a decision *can* be made.
*   **D: Oñekañy (It will be easy)** -  While possible, the text indicates recreating a rainforest is complex and requires multiple species.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions that many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Option A directly addresses a reason why someone might *not* be able to enjoy these pastries - a nut allergy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Peteĩ tapicha oiporavoséva umi mba’e he’ẽ hevévante** (Someone who doesn't understand the words) - While language barrier might hinder enjoyment, it doesn't prevent them from eating the pastries.
* **C: Peteĩ tapicha ndogustáiva chupe chocolate** (Someone who doesn't like chocolate) - The text doesn't mention chocolate being a primary ingredient in the pastries.
* **D: Peteĩ tapicha oguerohoryvéva umi mba’e he’ẽ pe umi he’ẽ jukývagui** (Someone who is sensitive to ingredients similar to those in the pastries) - While possible, allergy to nuts is a much more common and direct reason someone wouldn't be able to eat the pastries described.

Therefore, **A** is the most logical and relevant answer based on the information provided in the text."
Mba'e ingrediente-pa ojeiporuve elemento estacional-ramo umi mbujape he'ẽ Alemania-gua?,"The correct answer is **C: Ciruela-kuéra**.

The text explicitly states: ""cereza ha **ciruela** ojehecha jepi avei arahakúpe."" (cherries and **plums** are also seen in jams). This indicates that plums are an ingredient used in German cuisine, and the passage mentions seasonal ingredients. While apples and cherries are also mentioned, plums are specifically listed alongside other seasonal items.

This translates to: ""The advice tells travelers not to bother, not to bring illegal things, not to steal, and **not to bother other people** to travel safely.""

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the advice given in the text. The other options are incorrect because:

*   A:  The text doesn't say anything about what to do *before* traveling.
*   B: The text emphasizes comfort.
*   D: The text doesn't mention anything about expensive hotels or flights.

Here's why:

* The article discusses motorcycle travel.
* The question asks *when* someone should be careful when traveling by motorcycle.
* Option C directly addresses this by mentioning people *preparing* to travel by motorcycle, implying that precautions are necessary during preparation.

The other options are not as relevant:

* **A: Peteĩ tapicha oguerohorýva umi desafío (Someone who faces challenges)** - While travel can present challenges, this is too general.
* **B: Peteĩ tapicha hi’aravo hetáva (Someone who is talking)** - This is unrelated to motorcycle travel or safety.
* **D: Peteĩ tapicha ovy’áva oikundahávo peteĩ taperekónte (Someone who is looking at a map)** - Looking at a map is a part of preparation, but not the core reason for needing to be careful.  Option C encompasses this better by focusing on the entire process of preparation.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nderejpokuaáiramo emboguata mba'yrumýi tape rural rehe, eguereko nde ingenio nendive:oĩ heta pendiente ijyvatéva, carril estrecho ha curva pronunciada-va."" (Although I don't have knowledge of rural roads, I understand that it has many steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves).
* While the other options are *elements* of the road, they are not the *overarching* characteristic that the passage emphasizes as making the stretch difficult.  The rural nature and its inherent features (inclines, narrowness, curves) are the key.

Therefore, option A is the most comprehensive and accurate answer.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Buffalo-Pittsburgh race features long straightaways where cars can reach speeds of 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h).  The question asks what makes this race so challenging. The answer isn't traffic (A) because the text doesn't mention it.  The difficulty isn't solely due to rough roads (B) although the road conditions are challenging.  The fact that cars can go fast on the straights (D) doesn't explain *why* the race is difficult; it's the contrast between the straightaways and the challenging curves that creates the difficulty. Therefore, the ability to drive faster on the straightaways is part of what makes it a unique and challenging race.

Mávapa ko’ã mba’e apytégui noñeikotevẽi oñeñepyrũ hag̃ua ojejapo barranquismo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ojepokuaaiterei**.

* **The passage states:** ""Barranquismo-pe oñembojoaju elemento jeyta, jejupi ha jepo, katu natekotevẽi heta entrenamiento rehe térã tete ñemongu'e oñemoñepyrũ haguã (ita rehe jejupi rovake, buceo, terã esquí alpino, techapyrãramo)"" which translates to: ""Canyoning involves rappelling, swimming, and jumping, but it doesn't require much training or initial preparation (like cave diving, diving, alpine skiing, or paragliding).""
* **Therefore, the answer is that extensive training is *not* required.**  ""Ojepokuaaiterei"" (meaning ""is not necessary"" or ""is not required"") accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojeytakuaa** (meaning ""is suitable"" or ""is appropriate""): While it *can* be suitable, it doesn't specifically address what *isn't* needed.
* **B: Tete oĩ porãitereirasa** (meaning ""is very good""): This is irrelevant to the question about preparation.
* **D: Ñembokatupyry michĩmi** (meaning ""is minimal""): While preparation might be minimal compared to other activities, the passage specifically says it *doesn't require much*, which is a stronger statement than just minimal.

Here's why:

* **Barranquismo** is described as involving challenging elements like rappelling, jumping, and swimming. It also mentions that significant training isn't *always* required, but preparation is still key.

* A **good canyoning guide** is essential for safety and proper technique. They know the canyon, the hazards, and how to manage the various elements.  They can also provide necessary equipment and instruction.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Katupyryeterei atletismo rehegua (Good athletic training):** While athleticism is helpful, it's not the *most* crucial factor.  A guide provides the specific knowledge and skills needed for canyoning.
* **B: Ojejapomava’erãkuri buceo upe mboyve (Being able to dive in the river):**  While diving might be *part* of some canyoning trips, it's not a universal requirement and doesn't cover all the skills needed.
* **D: Katupyry jeyta hag̃ua (Being prepared):**  ""Prepared"" is too general.  Being prepared *how*? A guide provides the specific preparations necessary for a *canyoning* excursion.



Therefore, having a knowledgeable and experienced guide is the most important factor for a successful and safe canyoning excursion.

Here's why:

The prompt describes a scenario where the tent is packed neatly and efficiently, making it easy to transport in a vehicle.  The key factor enabling this is knowing *how* to pack and fold the tent effectively.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the *best* fit:

* **B: Mba’yrumýi ikatúva oñemoñeno ijapyka** (A tent that can be folded compactly): While important, the prompt emphasizes efficient packing *regardless* of the tent's compactibility.

Here's why:

* **The text describes needing a vehicle to transport camping gear.** The initial paragraph emphasizes that camping requires transporting a lot of items.
* **The question asks how to transport camping gear to a store.**  The question is slightly misleading - it's not about transporting to a store, but about *getting* to a place where you can set up camp.
* **Option A directly addresses the need for a vehicle large enough to carry camping supplies.**  SUVs and minivans are commonly used for this purpose.
* **The other options are incorrect:**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabo da Roca:** This is a location, not a description of how Sintra relates to other artists.
* **B: Ojekuaahague Tupãsy María:** This refers to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima, a different site mentioned in the passage but not directly related to Sintra's connection to artists.
* **D: Ojejuhu iporãmbajepéva joahu renda:** This means ""finding the beautiful view,"" which is simply a description of Sintra, not how it connects to other artists.

The passage states: ""P: 1994-pe, Nagorno-Karabaj Azerbaiyán tavusupegua..."" which translates to ""P: In 1994, Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan...""  The passage focuses on the region of Nagorno-Karabakh as the core issue.  While the other options are related to the situation, they are not the primary subject being discussed in the question ""Mba'épa ndohechakuaái Armenia?"" (What does Armenia control?).

(One country was divided, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan remained whole. With Armenia's support, Nagorno-Karabakh region became an independent republic.)

The question asks what *caused* the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The passage indicates the conflict originated with the creation of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Armenio-kuéra oikóva Azerbaiyán-pe (Armenians living in Azerbaijan):** While there was a significant Armenian population in Azerbaijan, it wasn't the *cause* of the conflict; rather, it was a contributing factor and a point of contention. The conflict was primarily about the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
* **B: Ñorãirõ 1994-peguare (In 1994):** 1994 is when the conflict escalated significantly, but the underlying issues predated this. The root cause was the formation of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.

This translates to ""A good thing in Charlotte...you can easily request it from many places...they are easily found as if they were a bus.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojeikórõ ambue tendápe (They are requested from other places):** While you *can* request a taxi from other places, the main point is their general availability.
* **B: Oĩramo mbohapy pasajero (There are three passengers):** The passage mentions a surcharge for more than two passengers, but this isn't what happens *when* you request a taxi.
* **C: Ojehórõ Uptown gotyo (When going to Uptown):** The passage doesn't specify a particular area when mentioning taxis. It's about their general availability throughout Charlotte.

"Pe pehẽnguépe he’iháicha, mba’épa ikatu oñeconsidera peteĩ mba’e vai jaikorupi Charlotte-pe mitãnguéra ndive?","The correct answer is **C: Umi oikóva ambue tendápe (Those who are located in other cities)**.

Here's why:

The first paragraph describes how Charlotte has a great transportation system, particularly for people who have arrived from other cities. It mentions the city's ability to easily transport visitors from the airport to their destinations.  The emphasis is on the ease of travel *from other locations*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Óga repy rehegua (Related to money/payment):** While there's mention of a surcharge, the core of the paragraph is about the ease of transport, not financial aspects.
* **B: Ojeiporúvo peteĩ taxi (When taking a taxi):** The paragraph states that taxis aren't the primary mode of transport in Charlotte, and then goes on to describe other options.
* **D: Oñeha'ãrõ ojevy'a tavaguasúpe (When using ride-sharing apps):**  While ride-sharing might be an option, it's not specifically mentioned as a key aspect of Charlotte's transportation system in the text.

"Og̃uahẽ mboyve España-guakuéra, mávapa ocontrola Chile norte gotyo?","The correct answer is **A: Mapuche**.

The text states: ""España-gua og̃uahẽmboyve siglo XVI-pe, norte de Chile oĩ va’ekue Inca poguýpe, umi indígena araucano (mapuche) oiko va’ekue centro ha surgotyo Chile-pe."" 

This translates to: ""After the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca power, and the indigenous Araucano (Mapuche) established themselves in the center and south of Chile.""

Therefore, the Mapuche controlled northern Chile after the Spanish arrival and before the 19th century.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼãva apytégui ndoikóiva’ekue 1810-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Pe gobierno central ipore’ỹetékuri** (The central government was weakened).

Here's why:

The text states that the Napoleonic Wars in Spain weakened the central government. This created a power vacuum and instability that allowed Chile to declare independence in 1810.  The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Chile oganákuri España-guakuérape** (Chile was annexed by Spain) - This is the opposite of what happened. Chile fought for independence.
* **C: Ojegueroguatahínakuri umi ñorãirõ Napoleón rehegua** (They were defeated by Napoleon's forces) - While Napoleon's wars had a global impact, the text doesn't mention Chile directly being defeated by Napoleon's forces. It highlights the weakening of Spain itself.
* **D: Chile ohupyty sãso** (Chile achieved independence) - While Chile *did* achieve independence later, the question asks *why* things didn't happen in 1810. The weakening of the Spanish central government *led to* the 1810 declaration, but it wasn't the *reason* things didn't happen *in* 1810.
"
Mba'éichapa ikatu og̃uahẽ tapichakuéra umi aldea mombyry oĩva tendapehẽ Liguria-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Tren térã yga rupive** (Train or by boat).

The text states that Cinque Terre consists of five villages (Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, and Monterosso) located in the Liguria region of Italy. It also mentions that people have built terraces and cultivated the landscape on the cliffs overlooking the sea. Finally, it says that the villages are connected by narrow paths and that the combination of the sea, cliffs, and vineyards create a unique view. 

While the text mentions the scenic beauty, it doesn't explicitly state the primary modes of transportation to reach the villages. However, knowing about Cinque Terre, we understand that accessing these villages is commonly done by either train or boat, or a combination of both.  

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mba’yrumýi térã yga rupive (By car or by boat):** While cars might access some parts, it's generally discouraged due to limited parking and narrow roads.
*   **B: Mba’yrumýi térã tren rupive (By car or by train):** Cars are not the main access method, and while trains are an option, boats are also crucial.
*   **D: Aviõ térã tren rupive (By plane or by train):** Planes are not used to reach Cinque Terre as there are no airports in the immediate vicinity.



"
Mba’épa he’ise ‘Cinque Terre’?,"The correct answer is **A: Po tava’i (Towns)**.

The text states: ""Cinque Terre, he’iséva Po Yvyvore..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Town...""  The text then lists the five towns that make up Cinque Terre.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’eichagua bota iporãve ojeiporu hag̃ua ro’y jave umi isỹiháme?","The correct answer is **B: Bota orekóva tachuela (Shoes with treads)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...ambue bota oguereko tachuela ha oĩ ambue equipo orekóva clavo tenda isýĩvape guarã..."" (other shoes have treads and other equipment with nails in the soles...). This directly links treads to good grip on ice and snow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bota orekóva taco po’i (Shoes with a flat heel):** While a flat heel might offer *some* stability, it doesn't provide the necessary grip for icy or snowy conditions.
* **C: Bota orekóva taco yvate (Shoes with a high heel):** High heels are *very* unsuitable for ice and snow. They offer poor stability and traction.
* **D: Bota ndorekóiva peteĩ patrón 1/5 pulgada ipypukúva (Shoes without a 1/5 inch tread pattern):** The text emphasizes the importance of a tread pattern *of that size* for good grip.  So, *having* a tread pattern is important, and this option is incorrect because it suggests the *absence* of one.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui noipytyvõmo’ãi oñemyatyrõ hag̃ua tracción umi tape henyhẽva hielo ro’y javépe?,"The correct answer is **A: Juky (Calcio cloruro)**.

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...tacón-kuéra ikarape ha ipe va'erã, yvyku'i, grava térã juky (calcio cloruro) py'ỹinte oñemosarambíva carretera..."" ( ""...the heels are made of rubber and plastic, and are sprinkled with sand, gravel, or **calcium chloride**..."") This directly links calcium chloride to improving traction on icy roads.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Grava (Gravel):** While gravel can provide some traction, the text mentions it as an alternative to calcium chloride, implying it's not the *best* solution.
* **C: Yvyku'i (Sand):** Similar to gravel, sand is a possible option but calcium chloride is specifically mentioned for ice.
* **D: Y (Water):** Water would make the situation *worse* by creating a slippery surface.



"
Mba’érepa ko'ãva apytégui ojojoguaiterei Hawái ha Isla-kuéra Cook?,"The correct answer is **A: Mokõivéva oguereko heta hotel tuicháva** (Because they have many large hotels).

The text explicitly states: ""...umi isla sapy'ánte oje'éjepi hese """"Hawái yguypegua"""" Michĩvéramo jepe, imandu'a ambue Hawái visitante itujávape oĩ mboyve estadía umi hotel turístico tuichávape ha ambue jeguerojera."" ( ...these islands are called ""Hawaii-like"" even smaller, attracting many Hawaiian visitors to stay longer in the many tourist hotels and other resorts.)

Option A directly reflects this information. The other options are not mentioned or supported by the text.
"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytégui nomombe'úi hekopete umi Isla-kuéra Cook rehegua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ha'e peteĩ archipiélago**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Isla-kuéra Cook hína peteĩ archipelago orekóva 15 isla..."" (Cook Islands are an archipelago consisting of 15 islands...).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ha'e michĩve Hawái-gui:** While the text mentions ""Hawái yguypegua"" (like Hawaii), it doesn't state that the Cook Islands are *smaller* than Hawaii. It refers to a similar time zone.
* **C: Umi tavaguasuvéva ha'e Rarotonga ha Aitutaki:** While Rarotonga and Aitutaki are mentioned as the main islands, the text's primary description is of the overall island grouping (archipelago).
* **D: Ko tetã ypa'ũ oguereko peteĩchagua zona horaria Hawai ndive:**  This is true, but it's a detail. The main feature described is that it's an archipelago.

Therefore, option B is the most comprehensive and accurate description of the Cook Islands as presented in the text.
"
Mávapa ko'ã guardabosques estación rehegua oikuave'ẽva mokõichagua jepyta hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sirena añoite hína guardabosques estación oikuave’ẽva ojepyta hag̃ua..."" which translates to ""Sirena is the ranger station that offers the possibility to..."" 

The other options are mentioned as locations where camping is available, but the question specifically asks about the ranger station offering the ability to reserve a permit.

The text states: ""CafeNet El Sol oikuave’ẽ peteĩ servicio de reservaciones peteĩ tarifa hepýva US $ 30, térã $ 10 peteĩ árape jeikerã rehe; eikuaave Corcovado página guive.""  This translates to ""CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a cheap price of US $30, or $10 per day for entry; see the Corcovado page.""  Since credit cards aren't accepted at the parking lot in Puerto Jiménez, CafeNet El Sol is the alternative option mentioned for booking a permit.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼeichagua esquípa ojejapo umi tenda escarpado-pe?","The correct answer is **C: Estilo alpino rehegua (Alpine style)**.

This translates to: ""Be careful, do not do skiing or **alpine skiing** in unpatrolled areas, these two are done in steep terrain and require skis and boots to be attached.""

Option C, ""Estilo alpino rehegua,"" accurately reflects this.  The other options are either too general (A, B, D) or don't specifically mention the challenging terrain described.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa ikatu oipytyvõ umi esquí huguapegua ohose pya'evévape?","The correct answer is **B: Peteĩ mochila pohýi (A small backpack)**.

The text states: ""Oĩ porãramo ikatu reho mombyryve jeguatágui, katu sapy'ánte reguerekóta esquí rugua jeho pya'e peteĩ mochila pohyi'ỹre pista oñemyatyrõpyrévape."" This translates to: ""It's good to be able to carry things, but later you can easily take your skis and go quickly on a small backpack on groomed slopes.""

This directly indicates that a small backpack helps skiers travel quickly, especially on groomed slopes.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bota-kuéra hatãvéva (Specialized boots):**  While important for skiing, boots don't directly help with speed *after* skiing.
* **C: Oĩ porãramo (Being able to carry things):** This is a general statement, not a specific factor for speed.
* **D: Umi pista oñemyatyrõpyrévape (On groomed slopes):** Groomed slopes are a *condition* that allows for faster skiing, but the backpack is what facilitates moving quickly *on* them.

Umi viajero ohasáva shock jejujey mba’e hasy chupe ojapo hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojepokuaa pe cultura tenda pyahupegua rehe** (They learn about the indigenous culture).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Guatahárakuéra otopava ndahasýi otende haguã pe cultura pyahu hetavece otopa hasyeterei ojepokuaa jevy haguã pe icultura nativore."" This translates to ""Tourists are not able to easily understand the indigenous culture because they are often encouraged to learn about the native culture."" The rest of the passage details the positive reactions of the local people when tourists show interest in learning about their culture.

Options B, C, and D are related to the tourist's experience but not the *reaction* of the local people to the tourist showing interest in the indigenous culture.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’eichagua viajero-pe g̃uarãpa hasyvéta pe shock jejujey haguére ramomegua?","The correct answer is **A: Umi viajero ohasavaíva oikévo ambue cultura pyahúpe** (Travelers who are exposed to a new indigenous culture).

Here's why:

The text explains that culture shock happens when someone is exposed to a significantly different culture.  The text emphasizes that the impact of culture shock is lessened by *exposure* to the new culture. The passage states that travelers are often prepared to understand and appreciate the new culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi viajero ojeadaptáva pya'e oiko jave tetã ambuére** (Travelers who adapt quickly upon arriving in a new country): While adaptation is helpful, the text isn't focused on *speed* of adaptation, but rather the initial exposure as a mitigating factor.
* **C: Umi viajero oĩva gueteri jasy eiragui fase-pe** (Travelers who are in the ""third month"" phase): The text doesn't mention any specific phases of culture shock.
* **D: Umi viajero orekóva sa’ive py’aguapy** (Travelers who have a strong sense of humor):  Humor can help, but the core issue addressed in the text is cultural *exposure*, not just a personality trait.

Mba’épa ko’ãva apytégui ndojapoiva’erã tapichakuéra alce ndive?,"The best answer is **C: Oñemomichĩ umi amenaza potencial ikatúva ojeguereko** (They assess potential threats that could endanger them).

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""Tapichakuéra ndohechairamo alce ikatuha peligroso, ikatu oñembojaiterei oñemoĩ peteĩ riesgo-pe."" (People don't think an elk is dangerous, but they are alerted and put at risk.) This implies people are *aware* of potential dangers associated with elk, even if they don't perceive the elk themselves as inherently threatening.

* **Option C directly addresses this:** Assessing potential threats is a logical response to being alerted and placed at risk.  People would evaluate what dangers *might* come with the presence of an elk (e.g., charging, territorial defense, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ojehechagívo oĩha hikuái** (They have it in front of them): This doesn't explain *why* they're doing something, just that they're experiencing something.
* **B: Oñeñembojávo mbeguekatuete** (They are more cautious): While caution is a possibility, the prompt emphasizes *assessment* of threats, not simply increased caution.
* **D: Mombyry guive ojejesarekóvo hesekuéra** (They wait until they are sure of them):  Waiting until sure doesn't address the prompt's idea of being ""alerted and at risk.""

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and logical response to the provided prompt."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa umi mbaʼe ojeʼéva alce rehegua apytépe ndahaʼéi añetegua?","The correct answer is **B: Sapy’ánte ndojehechakuaái chupekuéra peteĩ amenaza potencialramo** (They are not perceived as a potential threat).

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks what the following statements *don't* say about moose.
* **The premise (P)** states that moose aren't aggressive, but they *can* be a threat when feeling threatened, and people often view them as dangerous.
* **Option B** directly contradicts the premise. The premise states that people *do* see moose as a threat, but option B says they *don't*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha’ekuéra ha’e mymba iñañáva (They are wild animals)** - This is a general statement about moose, not necessarily something the premise contradicts.
* **C: Ikatu omombáy chupekuéra umi yvypóra oĩva ag̃uieterei (They can provoke people who get too close)** - This aligns with the premise that moose can be a threat when feeling threatened.
* **D: Oñedefendéta hikuái tekotevẽramo (They defend themselves if threatened)** - This is also in line with the premise about moose defending themselves when threatened.



Therefore, only option B accurately reflects what the premise *doesn't* say about moose."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼãva apytégui saʼive ipeligrosóta peteĩ viajero desierto-peguápe g̃uarã?","The correct answer is **C: Oipuru rei imbaretekue ojehóvo pe y ra’ãnga rapykuéri** (They hallucinate when they see mirages of water).

Here's why:

The question asks about the dangers of a desert for travelers, specifically referencing hallucinations.  The provided text directly states: ""umi visitante-pe guarã ohapykuhóramo upe espejismo, oipuru rei imbaretekue ha y oguerekóva rembyre"" (visitors can be deceived by mirages, hallucinating and becoming thirsty).  Option C directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndojeguerekói ao aku peteĩ pyhare ho’ysãvape g̃uarã** (They don't have access to a fresh water source in the desert) - While lack of water is a *major* danger, the question is specifically asking about dangers related to *hallucinations*.
*   **B: Ohechávaicha peteĩ y ra’ãnga ha’etévaicha añeteguáva** (They see a mirage and believe they can drink it) - This is partially true, but option C is more precise because it emphasizes the *hallucination itself* as the cause.
*   **D: Oñeñohẽmbarei y ojeho aja peteĩ y ra’ãnga rapykuéri** (They don't get lost and find a shady spot) - Getting lost is a desert danger, but the question is not focused on getting lost, it's focused on hallucinations.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndoje’éi ha’eha peteĩ amenaza potencial umi viajero desierto-peguápe g̃uarã?,"The correct answer is **C: Ro’yetereirasa** (Hypothermia).

Here's why:

The passage mentions several threats in the desert: mirages, dehydration, and heatstroke. However, it *also* states: ""Avei umi desierto hakuvéva ikatu pyharekue ro’yeterei"" which translates to ""Also, very cold deserts can be very cold."" This directly points to the risk of hypothermia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Y pokã (Dizziness):** While dizziness can be a symptom of dehydration or heatstroke, it's not explicitly mentioned as a primary risk in the text.
* **B: Y ra’ãngagua’u (Dehydration):** Dehydration *is* mentioned, but hypothermia is also explicitly mentioned as a risk in cold deserts.
* **D: Pirekaipa (Sunstroke):** Sunstroke is a risk in hot deserts but the passage mentions cold deserts as well.

Therefore, **Ro'yetereirasa (Hypothermia)** is the most accurate answer because the text specifically mentions cold deserts and the risk of it.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼe ava’atýpepa tuicha ojeafectákuri og̃uahẽ rire umi explorador?","The correct answer is **C: Umi Taínos**.

The text explicitly states: ""Fray Bartolomé de las Casa taiha rupive (Tratado de las Indias) umi 1492 ha 1498 pe, conquistador Español kuéra ojuka 100.000 Tainos kuéra."" This translates to: ""Thanks to Fray Bartolomé de las Casa (Treaty of the Indies) in 1492 and 1498, Spanish conquistadors killed 100,000 Tainos.""

Therefore, the Taino people were the ones most affected by the arrival of the explorers.

While the other options mention periods in history, the text clearly indicates skiing's origins are much earlier.
"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytégui ojehe'ájepi pe isla tuichavéva ndive oĩva África costa oriental gotyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Europa-pegua jepokuaapy (European exploration)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Influencia ha colonialismo Europa-gua oñepyrũ siglo XV-pe, explorador Portugal-gua Vasco da Gama ojuhúramo guare Ruta del Cabo Europa guive India peve."" (European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovering the sea route to India bypassing Europe.) This points directly to European exploration as the main factor influencing the larger islands off the East African coast.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Islám jeroviapy rehegua (Islamic influence):** While Islam *is* present and influential, the text focuses on the *initial influence* and major shifts, and doesn't frame Islam as the primary reason for the islands' situation.
* **C: Mymba ka’aguy (Rainforest):** The text mentions rainforests, but this is a characteristic of the islands, not the *reason* they are the way they are.
* **D: Umi resort de playa de lujo iporãvéva (Luxurious beach resorts):**  The text mentions resorts, but these are a *result* of later developments and tourism, not the *initial* influencing factor.

Mba’épa ndaha’éi umi isla michĩvéva África Oriental-pegua rehegua? ,"The correct answer is **D: Sãso ambue tetãgui (From other countries)**.

Here's why:

The text states that some of the smaller islands in East Africa are French territories and others are luxury beach resorts. It *doesn't* say they are from other countries. It implies they are *part* of other countries (France).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peteĩ joaju Francia ndive (Part of France):** The text explicitly mentions some islands being French territories.
*   **B: Heta resort de playa de lujo (Many luxury beach resorts):**  The text mentions luxury resorts as *a type* of island, but not that *all* small islands are resorts.
*   **C: Teko ka’aguy rehegua terekuãporã (Very rich in rainforests):** The text states that the larger islands are rich in rainforests. It doesn't mention the small islands being particularly rich in rainforests.

Here's why:

The question points out the potential connection between the Easter tradition and pre-Christian fertility rituals. The passage explicitly mentions that the tradition might be a blend of Christian theology and older practices related to fertility. Offering a fertility ritual aligns directly with this idea of a pre-Christian tradition influencing Easter customs.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Omotenondévo vigilia arapokõi pyharépe (Offering vigils in multiple stages)** - While vigils are part of Easter, the core of the tradition's potential pre-Christian roots isn't directly tied to multiple vigil stages.
* **C: Ojapóvo peteĩ vy’aguasu arapoty rehegua congregación-pe g̃uarã (Holding a fertility-related feast in the congregation)** -  A feast could be *part* of a fertility ritual, but the ritual itself is more fundamental.
* **D: Ojesarekóvo kuarahy resẽre (Celebrating at sunrise)** -  Celebrating at sunrise is a significant part of Easter, but it doesn't inherently connect to fertility rituals in the same way that offering a ritual does.



Therefore, option A best reflects the potential historical connection between Easter and fertility practices highlighted in the question."

The text explicitly states: ""Ecuador oikotevẽ umi Cuba-guápe toguahẽ raẽ peteĩ carta ñepyrũrã oike hag̃ua Ecuador-pe aeropuerto internacional térã punto de admisión fronterizo rupive.""  This translates to ""Ecuador requires a letter of introduction for Cubans traveling to Ecuador through an international airport or border entry point.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ pasaporte ovaléva poteĩ jasy ohasávo arange ojeviajaha (An oval passport valid for at least six months)** - While the text mentions a passport, it focuses on the *letter of introduction* as a primary requirement.  The passport validity is a separate condition mentioned later in the text, not a primary requirement for entry.
* **C: Peteĩ boleto ojeho ha ojeju hag̃ua ojehechaukávo mboy ára pukukue ojepytáta (A round-trip ticket showing the date of return)** -  The text mentions a round-trip ticket, but it's not the *initial* requirement described.
* **D: Peteĩ kuatia’atã rovyũ Estados Unidos-pegua (A visa issued by the United States)** - The text does *not* mention a visa issued by the United States. It focuses on requirements for Cubans traveling directly from Cuba to Ecuador.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Ecuador requires a letter to enter, and that these letters are used to prevent an uncontrolled migration flow.  This points to the main goal being to maintain organized migration.
* Option A is too narrow. While they do maintain a record of travelers, the primary purpose is not just to ""hold"" them.
* Option C is incorrect.  The text doesn't say they guarantee a traveler's stay.
* Option D is partially true (passport validity is checked), but it's a means to an end – maintaining organized migration. It's not the overarching goal.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ikatu hepyve ambue tetãre ambuépe reikohágui?,"The correct answer is **A: Ehechauka nde resa reikohápe (Check your prescription)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What should I check to be able to buy glasses in other countries?""
* **The text states:**  ""Ehecha ehechauka nde resa reikohápe..."" which translates to ""Check your prescription..."" This is the fundamental requirement for buying glasses *anywhere*. You need a valid prescription to get the correct lenses.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Umi marco alta gama-va (High-end frames):** While frames are important, the primary concern is the prescription. High-end frames are a secondary consideration.
* **C: Umi seguro tesa rehegua (The most reliable ones):**  ""Reliable"" is subjective.  A prescription is objective and essential.
* **D: Umi marco ikatu imitación (Imitation frames):**  The type of frames is less important than having the correct prescription to have the lenses made.



Therefore, checking your prescription is the crucial first step when buying glasses in a foreign country.

Here's why:

The text highlights that buying high-end frames from other countries can be risky. It mentions issues with imitation or imported frames that might not be suitable.  Option B directly addresses this risk by saying the prescription might not be correct for the frame, implying potential vision problems.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ikatu oñeikotevẽ peteĩ exámen adicional tesa rehegua (An additional test will be required)** - While an exam might be *needed* after buying frames, the core risk is the frame being incompatible with the prescription.
* **C: Ikatu nosẽporãi ha ndaha’éi añetegua (We won't get reimbursed and it won't be insured)** - This speaks about insurance and reimbursement, not the safety or effectiveness of the glasses themselves.
* **D: Ikatu pe seguro ndohepyme’ẽi umí rehe (Insurance won't cover them)** - Similar to C, this is about insurance coverage, not the potential harm to your vision.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate potential risk is that the frame won't be compatible with your prescription."
"Viru jeporu rehegua Malvinas-pe, mávapa añetegua ko’ã mba’e oje’éva apytépe?","The correct answer is **A: Umi isla okaháre oñemoneĩ tarjeta de crédito ha libra esterlina añoite**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umi isla jere rehe oĩva, ikatu hína ndoku’éi tarjeta de crédito jeiporu, katu ojeiporukuaáne divisa británica ha estadounidense.""  This translates to: ""On the islands there is, however, no credit card payment, but British and US currency can be used.""  It also says that credit cards and British pounds became available *after* the islands were inhabited (""Umi isla okaháre oñemoneĩ tarjeta de crédito ha libra esterlina añoite"").  Therefore, option A accurately reflects a key point made in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Stanley-pe añoite ojejagarra pe dólar Estados Unidos-pegua** - While US dollars are accepted, the text doesn't say they *became* accepted in Stanley in a specific year.
* **C: Umi libra malvinense oñemoambueva’erã oñesẽ rire umi isla-gui** - The text says it's *better* to exchange pounds *before* leaving the islands, not that they are exchanged upon arrival.
* **D: Pe libra malvinense rire pe libra esterlina ha’e viru ojeaceptavéva** - The text states that the British pound and the US dollar are acceptable, but it doesn't indicate the Falkland Islands pound itself is widely accepted.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, ojeviajavo Malvinas-pe Estados Unidos-gui, moõpa ikatu ideprovécho peteĩ forma de pago ndaha’éiva tarjeta de crédito rupive?","The correct answer is **B: Opa umi isla pukukue javeve** (Other islands, apart from the main island).

Here's why:

* The text states that while credit cards aren't accepted *in the islands* (presumably referring to the main island of the Falkland Islands), British pounds and US dollars are accepted.
* It also states that a ""libra malvinense (FKP) is pegged to one British pound (GBP).""
* Therefore, to use a payment method other than a credit card, you need to go to the *other islands* (presumably smaller islands around the main Falkland Islands).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe tienda FIC West-pe** (At the FIC West store): The text explicitly states that you can only exchange currency at the FIC West store *in Stanley*.  This doesn't address using a payment method *other* than a credit card on the islands.
* **C: Umi isla jere rehe oĩva** (Where they exist, the other islands): While technically true, it's not the best answer because it doesn't specify *how* you can use a different payment method.
* **D: Stanley pukukue javeve** (Outside of Stanley): The text says credit cards aren't accepted *in the islands* (implying the main island, Stanley). This isn't the solution to using a different payment method.

Mbaʼe oikóvapa ndojeheʼái umi jeguerohory ojejapóva tupãopegua rehe?,"The correct answer is **D: Umi acontecimiento tuichavéva tupão rehegua (Other events related to the deity)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the rituals involve either ""tupao aramboty"" (deity's image) or ""Tupã aramboty"" (God's image) or other things that are **related to the deity**. Option D encompasses this broader meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ elefante heñoihague (An elephant is adorned):** While elephants are part of the Kerala deity processions, the passage doesn't say *only* an elephant is involved.
* **B: Tupão aramboty (Deity's image):** The passage mentions the deity's image, but also other aspects of the rituals.
* **C: Peteĩ tupã aramboty (God's image):** Similar to B, it only refers to one specific aspect, not the full scope of events.



"
Moõpa ikatu ojehecha umi elefante oñembojeguáva?,"The correct answer is **C: Umi procesión ojejapóva umi tupaõ jeguerovy'ahápe**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *where* the elephants are seen.
* The text states that elephants are part of the regular procession (*procesión regular*) associated with the harvest festival in Kerala.
* Option C directly reflects this by saying elephants are seen in the processions organized by the villagers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oparupiete jasypateĩ paha guive jasypo mbyte peve** - This refers to the timing of the festival, not where the elephants are seen.
* **B: Tupaõkuérape** - While elephants are part of the festival, they are not *in* the houses (tupaõ).
* **D: Kerala rapére** - This indicates the region, but doesn't specify *where* the elephants are seen within Kerala.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided text."

Here's why:

The text describes how airlines charge more for first-class tickets, emphasizing the privileges associated with it (more space, comfort, etc.). It also states that airlines understand that some passengers are willing to pay a premium for these advantages.

The question asks what the *airline* does to maximize revenue from passengers desiring premium class.  The text implies that airlines leverage the demand for these luxuries, even if the first-class flight isn't a direct one.  Passengers willing to pay extra for the experience will choose a flight that offers the desired comfort and privileges, regardless of directness. Therefore, offering first-class tickets on flights that aren't direct allows the airline to charge a premium and increase revenue.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ehepyme’ẽvo ne empresa rupive (By your company offering it):**  This is too general.  It doesn't explain the *specific* tactic the airline uses.
* **B: Rereservarõ primera clase negocio-rãngue (By reserving first class for business travelers):** While this *can* be a strategy, the text doesn't focus on exclusively reserving first class for business travelers. It speaks more generally about passengers willing to pay for premium experiences.
* **D: Ojejuhúvo peteĩ sa’ive ojepagaha (By offering a payment option):** Offering a payment option is standard practice for any business, not a specific strategy for maximizing revenue from premium class.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa ha’éta peteĩ perdida de tiempo ojehekárõ ojereservakuévo peteĩ pasaje?","The correct answer is **B: Ñemuha clase (Economy class)**.

Here's why:

The text discusses how the airline has different classes (economy, business, first class) and how people pay different amounts for different levels of comfort and privilege.  The question asks what constitutes a ""perdida de tiempo"" (waste of time) when booking a ticket. The passage implies that choosing a lower class (economy) is the waste of time because the direct option (A) is better, and the other options (C & D) are related to different classes of service which the passage is comparing. 

The core of the passage argues that you're paying extra for the ""privilege"" of higher classes, and economy class is simply the base level.  Therefore, choosing economy class *is* the waste of time, relative to the potential for a better, more direct experience."
Mba’épa natekotevẽi  embohovake jave tarifa repy Africa-pe peteĩ tarifa yvy ape ári jerére ndive rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Costo adicional, ñeikundaha adicional rehegua umi tenda okaháre Africa-gui.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Ani nderesarái emoĩve hag̃ua umi costo adicional, ñeikundaha adicional rehegua, ñesẽ rehegua impuesto, mba’yrumÿi ha hetave mba’e..."" which translates to ""You will not be charged additional costs, such as additional fees, flight changes, language taxes, baggage fees, and many other things..."" and then ""oparuitepe g̃uarã umi tenda okaháre Africa-gui"" meaning ""especially when flights depart from Africa"".

Option A directly reflects this statement. The other options are mentioned as examples of things that *won't* be charged, not things that contribute to a cheaper fare.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa umi ñemuhaguasúpe oñepyrũ oikuave’ẽ hikuái peteĩ jeporavopyre opaichaguareíva?","The correct answer is **A: Tembi'u ojejapopyrémava (Microwave ovens)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how many supermarkets now sell microwave ovens. The question asks what appliance is most commonly found in households that are quick and easy to prepare food. Microwave ovens fit this description perfectly.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Umi horno microondas (Microwave ovens)** - This is essentially the same as A, but A is more concise and the better answer.
* **C: Umi karuha oĩva upe tendapevoi (The ovens that are in the house)** - This is too general. While ovens exist, the focus is on quick cooking, which microwaves excel at.
* **D: Hepy sa’íva (Fast food)** - Fast food is a *result* of quick cooking, not the appliance used for it.

Therefore, **Tembi'u ojejapopyrémava (Microwave ovens)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Mba’e comodidad ome’ẽva ñemuhaguasukuérapa ikatu oguerohory peteĩ cliente ojoguáva tembi’u ojejapopapyrémava?,"The correct answer is **A: Umi karuha oĩva upe tendapevoi** (The free samples that are available in the store).

Here's why:

* **The question asks about what provides comfort to a customer when they are trying a sample.** Free samples are a common way to allow customers to try a product *before* committing to a purchase. Having free samples readily available makes the experience more comfortable and less risky for the customer.
* **B: Sa’ive mba’e ojeporavo hag̃uáicha (How the product is prepared)** - While interesting, the preparation method isn't directly related to the customer's comfort during the sampling process.
* **C: Tembi'u ipýrava (The product is cheap)** - Price is a factor, but not the immediate comfort related to trying a sample.
* **D: Peteĩ horno microondas (A microwave oven)** - A microwave oven isn't related to the sampling experience itself.

Therefore, the presence of free samples is the most relevant and comfortable aspect for a customer trying a product.

Here's why:

The text explains that while Belgian and Swiss French have differences from standard French, they are still fundamentally French-based.  The text states that ""opavave belga ha suizo-kuéra francófonos , oñemoaranduva’ekue francés stándar-pe mbo’ehaópe, upévagui ikatu oikumby eréva jepéramo eipurúramo francés jeipapapy ypýva."" This translates to ""Belgian and Swiss francophones, they harmonize in standard French in formal situations, but you can still understand a bit of the standard French language.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe francés jeipapapy ypýva (Standard French language):** While standard French is *part* of what they speak, the question asks what *you* can understand. It doesn't mean that the entire language is understandable.
* **B: Ñe’ẽ francés-pegua ndojeporumeméiva (They don't understand French):** The text explicitly states that they *do* understand French, especially in formal settings and to some extent in everyday situations.
* **D: Hetave francés oñeñe'ẽva Francia retãme (Any French spoken in France):** The text is about Belgian and Swiss French, not French spoken in France.  And even if it were, it wouldn't mean you can understand their particular dialects.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate response to the question.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaha’éi peteĩcha Francia-pe Bélgica térã Suiza-peguáicha?,"The correct answer is **B: Pe papapy ñemohenda rehegua (The geographical relationship)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights that Belgium and Switzerland have geographical proximity to France and share a border with French-speaking regions of France. This shared geography contributes to their French-speaking populations having a different dialect of French, influenced by their own languages and historical interactions, distinct from standard French spoken in France.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Opaite ñe’ẽ ñe’ẽpu (A different language):** The passage explicitly states that they speak French, just a different variety.
*   **C: Pe francés estándar oñembo’éva mbo’ehaópe (Standard French being used in formal settings):** While the passage mentions that Belgians and Swiss often use standard French in formal settings, it isn't the primary reason for their distinct dialect.
*   **D: Pe jehaikatu oĩva umi ñe’ẽ francés-pe (The existence of French dialects):** The passage already discusses the existence of French dialects; it focuses on the *reason* for their distinctiveness in Belgium and Switzerland.

Therefore, the geographical proximity and relationship with France is the key factor discussed in the passage that sets Belgium and Switzerland apart from France in terms of their French dialect.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Opaháichante, ojehechámava’erã reserva pumbyry rupive aerolínea ndive."" (When you book, you can book directly with the airline.)

And then lists WestJet as an airline that offers these discounted funeral flight fares.  The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B:** The passage states you can book *directly with the airline*, not through a third-party service.
*   **C:** While Lufthansa is mentioned as an airline offering the discounted fares, the question asks when *you* might encounter this.  The passage doesn't specify *when* you'd encounter this with Lufthansa; it only lists it as one of the airlines.
*   **D:** Delta is also listed, but similarly, the passage doesn't specify *when* you might encounter this with Delta.

Therefore, the most direct answer based on the passage is that you might encounter these fares when booking with **WestJet**."
Mbaʼépa añete umi pe ñemano rehegua tarifa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ojereservava'erã directamente aerolínea ndive pumbyry rupive**.

The passage states: ""Opaháichante, ojehechámava’erã reserva pumbyry rupive aerolínea ndive."" This translates to: ""Upon requesting, a reservation can be made through the airline.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ome’ẽmba hikuái pe viaje funerario repykue (It only offers a funeral trip):** The passage says they offer travel *tariffs*, implying more than just funeral trips.
* **B: Ojereservava'erã directamente aerolínea página web-pe (It is reserved directly on the airline's website):** The passage mentions booking *through* the airline, not necessarily *on* their website.
* **C: Ocubri hikuái viaje aravo pahápema ojejeruréva repykue (It is discovered a trip to the place of burial):** The passage is about tariffs, not discovering trips.

Here's why:

* **The problem states:**  The issue arises from poor data connection, intermittent connections, or lack of connection, leading to poor performance or failure of the navigation app.
* **Option B directly addresses the potential solution:** A secure data connection is crucial for a navigation app to function properly.  A poor or insecure connection is a likely culprit for the described problems.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Reñeha'ã jave hembyve ndéve viru (Make sure to update your software):** While software updates can sometimes improve performance, they are not the primary solution to data connection issues.
* **C: Resẽvohína pe ojagarrahágui (Check the battery):** Battery level can affect performance, but it's unlikely to be the *main* reason for data connection problems.
* **D: Nderehepyme’ẽséirõ eiporu hag̃ua peteĩ dispositivo (Don't try to power on the device):** This is nonsensical and irrelevant.  The problem isn't about turning the device on or off; it's about the *connection* to data.



Therefore, ensuring a secure and stable data connection is the most relevant solution to the problem described.

Here's why:

* **The initial question** states that GPS navigation apps can become unreliable or fail to provide navigation if there are issues with the phone's data connection.
* **Option A** directly addresses this issue.  If the phone doesn't have a reliable data connection (cellular data or internet), the GPS app can't download updated maps or real-time traffic information, leading to poor performance or failure.
* **Option B (Ikatu hembyve ndéve viru - ""I can't understand you"")** is irrelevant to the technical issue of GPS navigation.
* **Option C (Ani hag̃ua eipuru - ""It doesn't work"")** is too general. While the app *might* not work, the problem isn't necessarily that it doesn't work at all, but that it works poorly *due to data connection issues.*
* **Option D (Natekotevẽi ejogua mapa-kuéra pyahu - ""We can't download updated maps"")** is also related, but option A is more comprehensive, encompassing data connection problems in general.



Therefore, data connection problems are the primary reason GPS navigation apps can perform poorly when using a standalone GPS device.

Here's why:

* The text states that agents can help you understand everything about the Galapagos and ships, and even help you track the ship's schedule.
* Option C aligns perfectly with this by suggesting booking through a travel agent specializing in Galapagos trips.  This leverages the agent's expertise to ensure a smooth and reliable booking process.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Reserva peteĩ aty oĩháme 8 rasa pe pasajero ndeichagua avei omba’ekuaaséva:** While having a group with a certain number of passengers might be beneficial in some cases, the text doesn't mention anything about this being a guarantee of booking.  It's not directly supported by the text.
* **B: Rejapova’erã pe reserva temporada oguejyve jave:** Booking ""when the season begins"" isn't a guarantee.  Demand is high, and the ship could be fully booked regardless of when you try to book.
* **D: Rejapórõ reserva voi:** Simply booking ""or not"" doesn't guarantee a booking. It's an incomplete statement.

Here's why:

The question asks which tactic *wouldn't* be used to prevent the two groups from meeting. Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Kuarahy jehesapeporãiterei (Very good sunshine):** This is irrelevant to preventing the groups from meeting. It might be a distraction, but not a preventative tactic.
* **B: Ñembojopói ojeike rei hag̃ua umi concierto-pe hamba’e (Disguise the search in the concerts):** This would *encourage* the groups to meet, as they'd be interacting at the concerts.  So it's *not* a tactic to prevent them from meeting.
* **C: Ñemboy’urã ñembojopói (Disguise the search):** This is a tactic to *prevent* the groups from meeting. By disguising the search, they would be less likely to recognize each other and avoid interaction.
* **D: Ndaipóri aravopapahakuéra (There are no accomplices):** This is not a tactic to prevent the groups from meeting, but a statement of fact.

Therefore, option C is the only one that represents a tactic that *wouldn't* be used to prevent the two groups from meeting.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa oñeha’ãva’erã omboyke peteĩ ha’ãhára iñarandúva?","The correct answer is **A: Alcohol je’ueterei (Alcohol intoxication)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a casino environment specifically designed to disorient and exploit guests. The lack of timekeeping devices (windows and clocks), confusing language, and carefully orchestrated distractions (music, games, and the availability of alcohol) all contribute to the goal of getting people to lose track of time and make poor decisions.  The final sentence explicitly states that the casino aims to make people forget how much time has passed and that the casino's staff are knowledgeable about how to manipulate guests' perceptions.

Alcohol intoxication is the most direct way to achieve this disorientation and make guests more susceptible to losing track of time and making impulsive, financially unwise choices.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Oimerãe mba’e mokyre’ỹrã ñemomeĩ (There are many stimulants available):** While stimulants *could* contribute to the problem, alcohol is the most common and readily available tool for achieving the desired effect in a casino.
* **C: Aravopapaha ñemaña (The language is confusing):** Confusing language is a *part* of the overall strategy, but not the primary driver of disorientation.  Alcohol amplifies the effect of confusing language.
* **D: Oñeporandu moõrupipa ikatu oñesẽ pya’eve (They teach people how to speak quickly):** This is highly unlikely and doesn't fit the overall scenario. The goal is not to *teach* people to speak quickly, but to *disorient* them.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What word describes the element that comes *before* a sentence or object?
* **Ñe’ẽteja** means ""sentence-starter"" or ""the word that initiates a sentence."" This fits perfectly with the description in the prompt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Ñe’ẽteva:** Means ""sentence-ending.""
* **Tero:** Means ""to begin"" or ""to start."" It doesn't specifically refer to the word *itself*.
* **Teroja:** Means ""to open"" or ""to expose.""

Therefore, **Ñe’ẽteja** is the only option that correctly identifies the word that precedes a sentence or object.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa ikatu ombohasýve pe téro ojehai hag̃ua tai tuichávape?","The correct answer is **B: Ñe’ẽtéva apytépe ñembojoavy**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What makes a word (ñe'ẽtéva) take a capital letter?
* **The text explains:** Words are capitalized when they begin a sentence or when they refer to a specific object.  It also mentions capitalizing proper nouns (like names).
* **Option B (Ñe’ẽtéva apytépe ñembojoavy - Capitalizing the word itself)** directly reflects this explanation.  The act of capitalizing the word happens *because* it's the beginning of a sentence or refers to a specific object.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moñe'ẽrã (It is said)** - This is a general statement and doesn't specify *why* a word is capitalized.
* **C: Jehaipy (To begin)** - While capitalization *can* mark the beginning of something, it doesn't encompass all reasons for capitalization.
* **D: Ñembojoavy umi mba’e apytépe (Capitalizing things)** - This is too broad and doesn't focus on the specific role of the *word* itself.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and complete answer based on the given text.

"Malasia okaháre, mbaʼe gesto-pa heʼise “eju”?","The correct answer is **A: Ojeipokávo pe kuã jehechaukaha** (By pointing the index finger).

The text explicitly states: ""ha’ete ku kua’ã índice ojepokáva rete gotyo"" which translates to ""and it's the index finger pointing outwards."" Therefore, option A is the accurate description of the Malaysian gesture.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼe gesto-pa ikatu heʼise “ejujey”?","The correct answer is **B: Ojeguerahávo tapykue gotyo pe kuã techaukaha (Pointing with the index finger towards the nose)**.

Here's why:

The question describes how a gesture of ""thank you"" is misinterpreted in Malaysia, where pointing at the nose with the index finger means ""eju"" (meaning ""stupid"" or ""fool""). The British traveler's attempt to say goodbye with a handshake was also misunderstood.

The question then asks what gesture is used to say ""ejujey"" (meaning ""sorry"" or ""excuse me"") in the same context.  The phrase ""Ojeguerahávo tapykue gotyo pe kuã techaukaha"" describes the gesture of pointing at the nose. In the context of the provided information, this is the gesture associated with saying ""ejujey"".

Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ojapo umi grieta?","The correct answer is **A: Umi puente de nieve (Snow bridges)**.

The passage states: ""Kóva ombohapéta grieta, ikuaha ikatúva opyta kañyhamẽ umi puente de nieves rehe."" which translates to ""It creates cracks, which can open up and break the snow bridges."" 

Therefore, the cracks are formed *because of* the snow bridges.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kóva ombohapéta grieta, ikuaha ikatúva opyta kañyhamẽ umi puente de nieves rehe."" This translates to: ""Here, cracks are formed, which can cause the snow bridges to break.""

Therefore, the cracks are the reason the snow bridges break.

(This town is also the base for Nyiragongo volcano and the ones who go to see the mountain gorillas in the highlands of Africa.) This indicates that Nyiragongo volcano is a significant attraction for visitors. While there are shops in Goma, and the town suffered from the volcano, the question is about a place visitors actively go to *visit*, and Nyiragongo volcano fits that description best.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for advice for a tourist visiting Goma.**  The text highlights the volatile situation in North Kivu due to ongoing conflicts. 
* **Option A directly addresses this risk.** Consulting locals is the best way to get up-to-date information about safety, potential dangers, and recommended precautions.  Locals have the best understanding of the current situation.

Let's look at why the other options are not as suitable:

* **B: Ha'e peteĩ tenda iporãva ojehapykuerereka hag̃ua umi Gorila yvyty yvate pegua oikóvape** (It's a good shop that offers tours to see mountain gorillas). While gorilla trekking is a major attraction in the area, a tourist's *initial* concern should be safety and understanding the political context.  Finding a tour operator is a secondary step.
* **C: Umi taxi moto ojeiporu porã eho hag̃ua Goma ryepýre** (Motorcycle taxis are convenient to get around Goma).  The text mentions motorcycle taxis as a *transportation option*, but it doesn't imply they are a reliable or recommended way to navigate the potentially dangerous environment.
* **D: Nyiragongo volcán pyenda opyta távape** (The Nyiragongo volcano is located within the city).  This is a fact mentioned in the text, but it doesn't offer advice for a tourist's safety or planning.  Volcanic activity can be a risk, but consulting locals is better for understanding the current level of risk and any precautions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peteĩ sistema de permiso oñeme’ẽva ouraẽvévape** (A permit system is given out on a first-come, first-served basis): While there's a limited number of permits, the text doesn't explicitly say it's first-come, first-served. It specifies a date (January 1st).
*   **C: Umi permiso ikatu ojehupyty ojejerurévo ha natekotevẽi oñeguenohẽ pedido upe mboyve** (Permits are only effective if requested and are not refunded if the request is made on that date): The text doesn't say this.
*   **D: Sa’i papapy oñeme’ẽ umi permiso** (No information is given about the permits): The text *does* give information about the permits - when they are issued.

Mávapa ko'ãva apytégui sa'ive ojejuhu pe tipo de hotel oñemombe'úva pe pasaje-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Umi irũnguéra oñeipepepirũva ojekuaa porãva térã ikatúva ojekuaa** (The guides who know well or can learn about them).

Here's why:

The text describes old, historic hotels with a rich past, often associated with steam trains, transatlantic voyages, and famous figures. It emphasizes their antique charm, lack of modern comforts, and the unique character they possess.  It mentions that travelers are captivated by these hotels.

Therefore, the option that best fits the description of what a traveler might seek *information* about *regarding* these hotels is guides who are knowledgeable or can learn about them. Options A, B, and D are all features *within* the hotels themselves, not what someone would seek information *about* *regarding* them.



"
"Oñemopyendávo umi marandu oje’évare, mávapa ko’ã oferta apytégui umi invitado hotel-pegua sa’ive omotenondétava?","The correct answer is **B: Peteĩ restaurante orekóva peteĩ chef herakuãporãva (A restaurant with an excellent chef).**

Here's why:

The text describes these hotels as having a rich history, attracting famous and wealthy guests, and being filled with antique furniture, elegant decorations, and a unique character.  While the other options *could* be present, a high-quality restaurant with a renowned chef aligns most directly with the description of catering to sophisticated and discerning guests.  It suggests a high level of service and culinary experience, fitting the profile of these historic hotels.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Umi mueble tuja oĩva tenda pukukue (Antique furniture in the lobby):** The text *already* mentions antique furniture throughout the hotels. This isn't a unique offering.
* **C: Peteĩ koty oñeikuave'ẽha ñembosarái pyharekue (A swimming pool to relax):** While a pool could be present, it's not highlighted as a defining feature or a reason to choose these hotels over others.  The emphasis is on history, elegance, and service.
* **D: Koty repykue ndahetái (No gym):** This contradicts the idea of catering to guests who value high-quality services. It's unlikely a hotel of this caliber would lack a gym.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ndojapoivaʼerã ambue tapicha okavagua ohóva Groenlandia-pe?","The correct answer is **B: Egueraha ao haku porãva upépe arahaku ary aja pukukue (Bring a good sleeping bag when you go there in the summer)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the importance of being prepared for the unique conditions in Greenland.  Specifically:

* **Lack of ""tenda ijetu'uha"" (shelters):**  There are no readily available shelters, so you need your own.
* **Risk of danger:** The text warns of dangers for those unfamiliar with the environment.
* **Sleep conditions:** It stresses the need for a good sleeping bag, especially if visiting during the summer months (as temperatures can be surprisingly cold).

Option B directly addresses this need for proper sleeping arrangements and preparation for the summer climate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oĩ tenda ojekuaáva hetárupi oĩ umi mba'evai apoha upépe (There are tents available for rent there with things to sleep on):** The text *specifically* states there are no readily available shelters.
* **C: Omba'apose oime aja upépe, Internet ikatu ndoikoporãmeméi (If you go there, the Internet isn't very good):** While the text mentions internet isn't great, it's not the primary concern or a core piece of advice about visiting. The need for sleeping gear is far more emphasized.
* **D: Jehero Esquimal peteĩ nativo Groenlandia-guápe (Call an Eskimo a native of Greenland):** The text directly addresses the problematic term"
"Pe pehẽngue heʼiháicha, mávapa ko’ã problema apytégui ikatu ojehu umi viajero noñembosako`írivape ovisita jave Groenlandia?","The correct answer is **A: Ñati’ũ nórdico uperupigua (Northern Lights)**.

Here's why:

The text details the unique experiences and potential dangers of traveling to Greenland.  It highlights:

* **Limited infrastructure:** Few hotels, lack of designated restrooms.
* **Cultural sensitivity:**  The problematic use of the term ""Esquimo"" and the importance of respecting Inuit culture.
* **Natural beauty:** The mention of the Northern Lights as a stunning sight.
* **Environmental risks:** The danger of unexpected weather changes.

The question asks what travelers might encounter *despite* these problems.  The text emphasizes that the Northern Lights are a major draw and a beautiful experience that many travelers seek out in Greenland, regardless of other challenges.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mba'evai'apo (Nothing):** This contradicts the detailed problems outlined in the text.
* **C: Ára (Day):** While it's day in Greenland sometimes, it doesn't address the specific challenges travelers face.
* **D: Umi tapicha upe tendágua (People of that village):**  While cultural sensitivity is important, the Northern Lights are a universally sought-after phenomenon, not limited to any particular village.

Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ojeporu ko`ág̃a plaza central ramo?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ko tenda oñemopu’ã va’ekue peteĩ convento siglo XVII-pegua atrio-ramo, ichugui hemby ko’agãite Templo de San Diego añoite. Ko’ágã oiko plaza central-ramo..."" which translates to ""This shop is located in the courtyard of a 17th-century convent, next to the San Diego Temple, and it is in the central square...""  This directly identifies Jardín de la Unión as being in the central square.

"Pe pehẽnguépe he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndojejuhúi Jardín de la Unión-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ mirador central oikohápe concierto (A central viewpoint hosts concerts)**.

The text states: ""ka’aru ha pyharekue sapy’ánte oiko concierto ojehepyme’ẽ’ỹva mirador central guive."" which translates to ""In the evening and at night, there are concerts projected from the central viewpoint.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Peteĩ mborayhu rembiasakue tuja róga (A romantic balcony)** - While the Alley of the Kiss has balconies, the text doesn't highlight them as a primary reason to visit.
* **C: Umi restaurante henyhẽva yvotyty ijerére (The food in the restaurants)** - The text mentions restaurants *in* the gardens, but doesn't focus on the food as a specific attraction.
* **D: Peteĩ óga tuja convento rehegua (A building related to the convent)** - The text mentions the convent as the location of the San Diego Temple, but doesn't emphasize the building itself as a key visitor draw.

"Oñemopyendáva oje´évare, mávapa umi ñe’ẽasãi oje’éva umi excursión peteĩ arapegua rehe oñeconsiderakuaáva hendape’ỹha?","The best answer is **A: Sa’i oñeikotevẽ ñembosako’i ojeguata hag̃ua peteĩ ára umi tape ndahasýivape.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the challenges of hiking:** It mentions the difficulty of a one-day hike, the potential for getting lost, and the risks of weather changes.
* **The question asks what aspects of a one-day excursion are considered important.**
* **Option A directly addresses the core problem highlighted in the passage:**  The need for careful planning and consideration of the trail's difficulty before embarking on a one-day hike.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Umi mombyrykue iñambue, ha katu oje’e ojecubri hag̃ua peteĩ ára pukukue javeve (The routes are prepared, and it is said to be discovered on the first day):** While routes might be prepared, the passage emphasizes the *difficulty* and *risk* of the trails, not just their preparation.
* **C: Umi tapicha hete omba’apo porãva generalmente ikatu oguerohory ko tembiapo (Generally well-prepared people usually undertake this activity):** The passage doesn't focus on the skill level of hikers. It highlights the risks even for experienced individuals.
* **D: Pe jeguata peteĩ aragua ndaha’éi peteĩ ñembosaráiokapegua oĩ porãva umi familia orekóva mitãme g̃uarã (Hiking is not a good activity for families with young children):** The passage doesn't specifically address suitability for families with young children. It focuses on the general challenges of one-day hikes.



Therefore, Option A most accurately reflects the importance of assessing trail difficulty before a one-day hike, as emphasized in the passage."
"He’ihaicha pe pehẽnguépe, araka’épa peteĩ jeguata peteĩ aragua oikotevẽ sa’i ñembosako’i?","The correct answer is **C: Mitãnguéra ohóta jave oguata**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Peteĩ caminata oikóva peteĩ árape guarã peteĩ sendero hasy'ỹva pukukuépe, tekotevẽ ñembosako'i michĩmi ha oĩmeraẽ tapicha hete hu'ũva ohecharamokuaa.""  This translates to: ""A walk on a trail in the forest, it is necessary to be careful and there are many people who are not aware.""  Then it continues: ""Oguayguakuéra orekóva mitã michĩva ikatu oikotevẽve ñembosako'i, katu peteĩ ára okaháre ndahasyiete jepéramo mitãra'ýre ha mitã oikémava mbo'ehaópe rehe."" This translates to: ""Those who are less experienced, they have no idea how to be careful, but one day, even after seven years, they still get lost in the forest.""

This means that the *reason* people get lost is because they are inexperienced hikers who don't know how to be careful and get disoriented, regardless of how long they've been hiking or where they are. The passage specifically points to lack of experience as the cause of getting lost.

Mba’épa ojoavy umi meseta Rogaland térã Agder-pegua oñembojojávo Noruega-peguare?,"The correct answer is **D: Py’ỹinte ojejaho’i hikuái brezo-pe**.

The text states: ""Rogaland ha Agder-pe ojehero jepi “hei”, he’iséva peteĩ páramo yvyraraka’ỹrehe ha py’ỹínte ojako’i upépe brezo-kuéra.""  This translates to: ""In Rogaland and Agder, it is called 'hei', which is a high plateau and on its slopes grows heather.""

The question asks what distinguishes the plateaus of Rogaland and Agder from the rest of Norway. The text specifies that *heathers grow on their slopes*.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oguereko hikuái yvyramáta (They are mostly covered in forest):** The text describes them as plateaus, not forests.
* **B: Ndaipóri umi fiordos (They don't have fjords):** The text explicitly mentions fjords as a characteristic of Norway, so this is incorrect.
* **C: Umi meseta hetave oĩ peteĩchapávante (The plateaus are more numerous than elsewhere):** The text doesn't make a claim about the number of plateaus.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaha’emo’ãi típico Noruega-pe g̃uarã?","The correct answer is **D: Umi páramo (The plateaus)**.

Here's why:

The text describes ""vidde"" in Rogaland and Agder as ""peteĩ páramo yvyraraka’ỹrehe ha py’ỹínte ojako’i upépe brezo-kuéra,"" which translates to ""a vast plateau with heather growing on it.""  The question asks what *isn't* typical Norwegian weather based on the text.  While fjords are mentioned, the text emphasizes the vast plateaus, suggesting they're a key feature of the landscape. The other options are described positively or are elements directly mentioned as defining features, not as what *isn't* typical."
Araka'épa umi turista oñeinteresáva esqui rehe ohova'erã umi yvytýpe?,"The correct answer is **A: Araro’y jave**.

* **Translation:** ""The tourist season of the ski resorts, many come to enjoy the native indigenous people. However, with good infrastructure and designed for the winter, there are many ski resorts that receive a lot of snow and allow for great skiing and snowboarding.""

* **Therefore:** The text explicitly says that the ski season is *during the winter* (araro’y - winter).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Temporada yvate aja (Upper season):** The text doesn't mention a specific ""upper season"".
* **C: Indio arahaku’aja (Indigenous people):**  While indigenous people are mentioned as a tourist attraction, they aren't directly related to *when* tourists go skiing.
* **D: Arapoty aja (Spring):** The text clearly states skiing is possible *because* of the snow, so it can't be in spring.

* **Translation:** ""Tourist season in the ski resorts, many come to see the indigenous people. However, with good slopes and for those who enjoy winter, there are many ski resorts that have a lot of snow and allow for great skiing and snowboarding.""
* **The question asks:** ""When do tourists come in large numbers to the ski resorts?""
* **The answer:** The text explicitly states that people come in large numbers *when there is winter* (""ojehecharamóva araro’y aja"" - for those who enjoy winter).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi yrypy’aku’i oĩ hetave jave** (There are many waterfalls): This is irrelevant to the question about ski resorts and tourism.
* **B: Pe snowboard temporada pukukue javeve** (The snowboard season is short): The text doesn't mention anything about the length of the snowboard season.
* **C: Indio arahaku’aja** (Indigenous people): While they are a tourist attraction, the question is about the *time* when tourists visit the ski resorts, not about the presence of indigenous people.

Mbaʼépa nderejapoiva’erã rehaʼarõramo retopa peteĩ yga nepytyvõkuaáva?,"The correct answer is **A: Jeguata yvate ha yvýre umi muelle-pe (Look up and down the docks)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a scenario where a hitchhiker arrives at a marina and actively looks for opportunities to help and connect with people. The most logical first step, based on the text, would be to observe the docks to see who needs assistance or who might be able to offer help.  The text explicitly mentions looking for people who might need help with their boats and connecting with sailors at the bar. This aligns with observing the docks.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ñemoangirũ umi capitán rehe (Approach the captains first):** While approaching captains might be *eventually* part of the process, it's not the immediate first action described or implied.
* **C: Eñemoherakuãvo umi servicio-kuéra (Advertise the services):**  The text doesn't mention advertising. The hitchhiker is offering help directly, not promoting services.
* **D: Emboykévo hapicha autoestopista ygaratepegua (Talk to other hitchhikers):**  While interacting with other hitchhikers might be part of the experience, it's not the most logical first step in seeking assistance.

Mba’épa rejapova’erã umi puerto deportivo jerére rehekávo peteĩ yga oikotevẽva pytyvõ?,"The correct answer is **A: Eñe’ẽ umi marinero ndive (Talk to the sailors)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a scenario where someone finds a hitchhiker at a marina. The person then contacts the sailors at the docks to alert them, allowing them to offer assistance to the hitchhiker. The text emphasizes communicating with the sailors to get information and help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Epyta radar guýpe (Check radar)** - This is irrelevant to the scenario. Radar is used for detecting ships, not people.
*   **C: Eñembojánte tapichakuérare omopotĩ aja ijyga (Warn people about the hitchhiker)** - While warning people is helpful, the text specifically states contacting the *sailors* at the docks, not just general people.
*   **D: Ejehekýi umi tapicha autoestopista-gui (Ignore the hitchhiker)** - This is the opposite of what the text describes. The text outlines a system for offering help.



"
Mba'e tenda oguerohorýta peteĩ turista ointeresáva chupe pe isla tembiasakue colonialva?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe Costa Norte (North Point)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Opaite nunga desarrollo urbano isla de Hong Kong-pegua oñemohenda jo’apa nunga tierra recuperada-pe costa norte pukukue javeve.""  This translates to: ""Besides the urban development on Hong Kong island, urban development is also expanding on reclaimed land on the North Point coast.""
* It further says: ""Kóva hína peteĩ tenda umi colonizador británico oñemomba’ehague, ha upévare, ehekáramo evidencia ko territorio rapykuere colonia jave guare, ko tenda iporãiterei emoñepyrũ hag̃ua."" This translates to: ""This was a place where the British colonizers first settled, and therefore, it is an excellent evidence of this territory being a former colony, starting with this area.""

Therefore, North Point is the area most relevant to a tourist interested in Hong Kong's colonial past. Kowloon promenade, Victoria Harbour, and Hong Kong Island's cityscape are impressive, but North Point directly represents the initial settlement and colonial history.



"

This directly indicates that Victoria Harbour is a key scenic spot for tourists. While the other options are mentioned in the text, Victoria Harbour is specifically highlighted as offering a great view.

(There are also other saddles, among which are English saddles, which have a leather bar that holds the stirrup from the saddle when a rider gets off quickly.)

This describes a mechanism designed to *reduce risk* when dismounting, specifically by preventing the saddle from sliding backward.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi suela ipo'íva (Smooth soles):** While smooth soles can be part of riding boots, the text doesn't link them to reducing risk specifically related to the stirrup.
* **C: Estribo cuero-guiguáva (Leather stirrups):**  Leather stirrups are mentioned as a standard type, but the text focuses on a specific *mechanism* (the bar) for risk reduction.
* **D: Tuichavéva estabilidad (Greater stability):** While stability is important, the question asks *how* the saddle reduces risk related to the stirrup, and the text points to the bar mechanism.

The text states: ""Hetave jinete-kuéra oiporu bota de montar peteĩ tacón ha **peteĩ suela lisa ha ipo'íva**."" (Many riders use riding boots with a heel and **a smooth and non-slip sole**.) This non-slip sole is what provides grip and security when the rider interacts with the stirrups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jeveve hapy sa'íva:** This refers to Casey Fenton's first experience, not what travelers receive *through* the hospitality exchange network.
* **C: Umi tour ome'ẽva umi guía upe tendapegua:**  The text doesn't mention tours or guides.
* **D: Ombojoapýva viejero-kuéra tendagua ndive umi téva ohohápe:** While this describes the purpose of the network, it doesn't specify *what* travelers receive.  The network *facilitates* the hospitality, but the hospitality itself is the main offering.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Sapy'ánte oguereko referencia ha temiando ome'ẽva ambue viajero"" (They have references and testimonials provided by other travelers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oĩ red ikatúva oikotevẽ verificación adicional umi viajero-gui** (Some networks can perform additional verification of travelers): While Couchsurfing *could* potentially have verification processes, the text doesn't mention it.
* **C: Umi viajero-pe oñeme'ẽta peteĩ tysýi umi óga jara ojeguerekóva tavaguasu rehegua** (Travelers are given a list of hosts with high ratings): The text doesn't state that travelers receive a list of highly-rated hosts.
* **D: Umi marandu óga jarakuéra uperupigua rehegua sapy’ánte ojeguereko umi viajero-kuérape oñeme’ẽ hag̃ua** (Testimonials from hosts are provided to travelers):  The text says travelers *provide* testimonials, not that they are provided to travelers.

Therefore, only option A is directly supported by the given text."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’eichagua huésped sa’ive ojejuhu peteĩ koty albergue compartido-peguápe?","The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ huésped orekóva mokõipa ary** (A guest who has two years).

Here's why:

The question describes a situation where guests in a hostel share a room and a bathroom, but some guests also have private rooms available. The key information is that even though they share common areas, they might still have different ages.

Option A, ""A guest who has two years,"" is a bit nonsensical and doesn't fit the context of age.  However, considering the other options:

* **B: Peteĩ huésped oviajava ha’eño (A guest who is younger than you)** - While possible, it doesn't directly address how guests *can* meet each other in a shared room.
* **C: Peteĩ huésped oviajava mitã michĩva ndive (A guest who is younger than you)** - Same as B, doesn't specifically address how they *can* meet.
* **D: Peteĩ huésped orekóva treinta áño mbytépe (A guest who is over thirty years old)** - This is a possible age, but it doesn't tell us anything specific about how they might encounter other guests in the shared space.

The most logical answer is that the guests will simply be in the same room and might interact based on their age, even if it's just a passing observation.  While none of the options perfectly capture the situation, option A is the *least* irrelevant and *could* be a way they might interact.

**It's important to note that this question is poorly worded and the options are not ideal.** A better question would ask *how* guests might encounter other guests, rather than focusing on a specific age.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa oiméne ikatuve opyta peteĩ albergue-pe?","The correct answer is **B: Mbohapy mitãrusu 22 ary orekóva oviajava oñondive**.

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** ""Alberguekuéra oñangarekove mitã pyahúre, peteĩ huésped jepiverõguáva oguereko hetave pokõi arýgui, katu py'ỹi avei ejuhukuaa viejero ijary hetavéva."" This means hostels accommodate various guests, including a single guest with many small children, and even elderly people.
* **The problem then mentions:** ""Ogayguakuéra mitãre ndojehechaguasúi, katu oĩ albergue omboejéva koty privado-vape."" This means the guests in the dormitories don't know each other, but some hostels offer private rooms.
* **The question asks:** ""Mávapa oiméne ikatuve opyta peteĩ albergue-pe?"" This asks about what kind of people you might find staying at a hostel.

Option B, ""Mbohapy mitãrusu 22 ary orekóva oviajava oñondive"" (Three 22-year-old brothers traveling together), fits this description. It's a plausible group of travelers who might stay in a hostel dorm and wouldn't necessarily know each other.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Peteĩ ojohogaygua oviajava peteĩ mitã heñói ramóva ndive** (A single person traveling with a newborn baby) - While possible, it's less common to find someone traveling *only* with a newborn in a hostel dorm.
* **C: Peteĩ pareja orekóva 70 ary** (A 70-year-old couple) - Couples of that age might prefer private rooms or other types of accommodation.
* **D: Mokõi familia oviajava imembykuéra ndive** (Two families traveling with their children) - This is much more likely to require private rooms or a whole separate accommodation.

Therefore, **B** is the most reasonable answer given the information provided.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about how the text describes the boomerang returning to the thrower.** The text explicitly states ""Reikuaaséramo mba'éichapa ojepoi boomerang ou jeýva nde pópe..."" (You want to know how a boomerang comes back to your hand...).  Option A directly addresses this, saying it's not easy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oguerohoryve umi tavayguakuéra upepeguavoi umi turista-gui** (It's thrown by tourists). This is irrelevant to how the boomerang returns. The text talks about the boomerang's ability to return, not who throws it.
* **C: Ndaipóri heta boomerang ojeguerekóva Australia-pe** (There aren't many boomerangs found in Australia). The text actually says the boomerangs found in Australia don't return. This option is the opposite of what the text states.
* **D: Oĩnte boomerang-kuéra ikatúva ojevy** (There are boomerangs that can be thrown). While true, the question focuses on the *return* of the boomerang, not simply its ability to be thrown.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ojepuruve tembi’u javanesa-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Asuka mbokajaguigua (Household sugar)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...javanés-kuéra oipotave jepi cacahuate, chile ha mora-kuéra (Especialmente hína **mbokaja asuka javanés**)..."" 

""Mbokaja asuka javanés"" translates to ""Javanese household sugar"". Therefore, the Javanese cuisine uses household sugar. While the other options are types of sugar, the text specifically mentions *mbokaja asuka* as being particularly characteristic of Javanese cooking.

* **Pathogens are the agents that cause infection.** These include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, as mentioned in the passage.
* **Option A (Tapichakuéra oguerekóva mba’asy rupive - From people with diseases) is incorrect** because while people *can* spread diseases, the underlying cause is the pathogen *within* them.
* **Option C (Bacteria rupive - From bacteria) is too narrow.** Bacteria are *one type* of pathogen, but not the only one.  The definition covers viruses, fungi, and parasites too.
* **Option D (Vacuna rupive - From vaccines) is incorrect.** Vaccines *prevent* infection, they don't *cause* it.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is that infectious diseases are caused by pathogens."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ndojekuaái omyeñoiha peteĩ mbaʼasy infeccioso?","The correct answer is **B: Virus-kuéra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Peteĩ mba'asy infeccioso hína peteĩ mba'esy omoñepyrũva peteĩ patógeno, ikatu peteĩ virsus, bacteria, hongo térã ambue parásito."" This translates to: ""An infectious disease is a disease that is initiated by a pathogen, which can be a virus, bacteria, fungus, or other parasite.""

Therefore, viruses are one of the things that can cause an infectious disease. While bacteria, fungi, and parasites also cause infectious diseases, the question asks what *can* cause an infectious disease, and viruses are explicitly mentioned as an example.

Mba’éicha javépa oĩ porãta puruhárape oiporavo peteĩ  web proxie-kuéra  VPN ome'ẽ harakuéra tapichápe g̃uarãva rendaguépe?,"The correct answer is **B: Puruhára ojehekýi hag̃ua censura poítica ha ojeikeve pype oñema'ẽ haguã.**

Here's why:

* The initial text states that VPNs are good for bypassing political censorship and IP geo-filtering.
* Option B directly reflects this key benefit: *jehekýi hag̃ua censura poítica ha ojeikeve pype oñema'ẽ haguã* (bypassing political censorship and encrypting your communication).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe puruhára ombohapepaite Internet tráfico** (The provider forwards Internet traffic): While true of VPNs, it doesn't highlight the *primary purpose* or main advantage discussed in the text. Many services forward traffic.
* **C: Pe puruhára ombohapepaite tráfico http año** (The provider forwards HTTP traffic):  This is incorrect. VPNs forward *all* Internet traffic, not just HTTP.
* **D: Pe puruhára rembiapo oikotevẽ peteĩ ancho de banda tuichavéva ha peteĩ kuave'ẽmby iporãvéva** (The provider works with a larger bandwidth and a faster connection): While a good VPN *should* offer this, it's not the *core benefit* that distinguishes it from other services. It's a consequence of good VPN implementation, not the primary advantage.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ã mba’e oje’éva apytépe VPN ha web proxy rehegua ndaha’éi añetegua?","The correct answer is **B: Umi web proxy ndaikatúi ombohapejey opaite tráfico web-pegua.**

Here's why:

* **VPN (Red Privada Virtual)** encrypts all internet traffic coming from your device and routes it through a VPN server. This protects *all* your online activity, not just web browsing.

* **Web Proxy** only handles web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS). It doesn't encrypt all traffic and doesn't protect traffic from applications other than web browsers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi VPN oikuave’ẽjepi ancho de banda tuichavéva umi web proxy-kuéragui** (VPNs use more bandwidth than web proxies) - This is generally *not* true. Proxies can be faster depending on the server load and encryption.
* **C: Umi web proxy oguereko sa’ive calidad iservicio oñembojojávo umi VPN rehe** (Web proxies offer better service quality than VPNs) - This is also usually *not* true. VPNs often offer more stable and reliable connections.
* **D: Umi VPN ikatu oisãmbyhyjey http tráfico añoite** (VPNs can handle HTTP traffic) - This is true. VPNs *can* handle HTTP, but they are capable of handling much more than just HTTP.



Therefore, the key difference highlighted in the question is the scope of traffic each provides.  VPNs protect all traffic, while web proxies only protect web traffic.

Here's why:

The question describes using a satellite to create a network connecting a location in Chicken Natureza to one in Arizona, specifically to a solar store. This directly relates to **global satellite networks** enabling communication and data transfer across vast distances, bypassing traditional terrestrial infrastructure.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Umi ñehenói oñembohasáva Internet rupive (Networks created via the internet):** While the initial setup might involve the internet, the core of the solution is the satellite link itself, not just the internet connection.
* **C: Satélite-kuéra (Satellites):**  This is too broad. While satellites are *part* of the solution, the question emphasizes the *network* aspect they enable.
* **D: Umi pumbyry RTC (RTC modems):** RTC modems are specific types of modems used for data transmission, but they aren't the overarching solution for a global satellite network connecting remote locations.

"Pe pehẽnguépe he’iháicha, mba’épa ikatu tekotevẽ ojejapo ojerrecibi hag̃ua ñehenói?","The correct answer is **A: Ejogua peteĩ papapy global**.

Here's why:

* The question describes the user creating a ""papapy"" (which translates to a blog or online post) and then asks how it can be accessed by others. 
* The answer ""Ejogua peteĩ papapy global"" (You create a global blog) directly addresses the creation of content accessible to a worldwide audience, which is the natural outcome of creating something online.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eipuru peteĩ teléfonía ñemuha oĩva upe tendápe** (You install a telephone connection in that place): This is about setting up communication, not sharing a blog.
* **C: Ehupyty peteĩ papapy ne comunidad local-gui** (You get a blog from your local community): The user *creates* the blog, it's not received from a local community.
* **D: Ejogua peteĩ pumbyry RTC** (You create an RTC module): While an RTC module (Real-Time Clock) could be *used* in a system, it's not the primary output or what's meant to be shared.

Therefore, the most logical and accurate answer is that the user creates a global blog.

Here's why:

The text states that in Italian, a double 'r' (rr) is pronounced differently from a single 'r' (r). The example ""carro"" (cart) vs. ""caro"" (expensive) demonstrates this. Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hetave ñe’ẽ oñembohyapu pe ojehaiháicha** (Many words are pronounced as they are written): This is incorrect because the text explicitly shows a deviation from the written form (single 'r' vs. double 'r').
*   **C: Umi ñe’ẽ orekóva tai c ha g ikatu ijetuʼu** (Words containing 'c' and 'g' are always pronounced the same):  While 'c' and 'g' can have different pronunciations, the text focuses on 'r' and 'rr'. Furthermore, 'c' and 'g' are not always pronounced the same.
*   **D: Hetave ñe’ẽ oñembohyapu ambuéicha ojejesarekóvo mba’eichagua pu’aépa ou upe rire** (Many words are pronounced differently depending on the vowels around them): While vowel combinations can *influence* pronunciation in Italian, the primary distinction highlighted in the text is between single and double 'r'.

The text specifically mentions: ""Bulevar kakua, oga’yvate henonde vidrio..."" (Wide boulevards, with glass lining...). This directly answers the question of what is described in the text.

While the other options are *part* of the description, the wide boulevards are a more encompassing feature mentioned at the beginning, setting the tone for the city's appearance.

This translates to ""Esmirna is the second largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, and it has the second largest port after Istanbul and its economic importance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko táva ojere peteĩ ypa tuicháva rehe** (This city is home to a large historical site): While the text mentions historical elements (mezzas and churches from the 13th century), it doesn't emphasize a *large* historical site as a defining feature.
* **B: Pe tekoha ohechauka Turquía ymaguare** (The city showcases Turkey): This is generally true, but not a specific detail highlighted in the text.
* **C: Ikatu rejuhu mokõive ñemuhaguasu moderno ha tupão ymaitereiguare** (You can find both modern and ancient ports): The text only focuses on the port's size and economic importance. It doesn't elaborate on the coexistence of modern and ancient ports.

The text states: ""P: Cerezo poty rehe jejesareko katui, ojekuaáva hanami ramo..."" which translates to ""P: When we observe the cherry blossoms, we can understand hanami..."" and then explains that *hanami* is the concept of enjoying cherry blossoms. Therefore, *hanami* refers to cherry blossoms.
"

The text states: ""Japón-pe, umi vy’arenda cerezo poty ombosako’iva’ekue emperador, ima’erãite ha ambue hapichakuéra aristocracia-pegua Corte Imperial-gua."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the cherry trees were considered by the emperor, nobles, and other people of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.""

Therefore, the Japanese aristocracy valued the cherry blossoms.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼã mbaʼe Jerusalén rehegua saʼive ogueraháva turismo?","The correct answer is **C: Umi oferta cultural orekóva (Its cultural offerings)**.

Kóva hína táva marãngatu mbohapy jeroviapy hemimo’ã peteĩvape g̃uarã: judaísmo, cristianismo ha Islam, ha ojeiporu centro espiritual, religioso ha cultural-ramo.""  This highlights Jerusalem's significance as a *cultural* center due to its religious importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Pe táva he’iséva jeroviapy ryepýpe (It's a strategic location):** While Jerusalem *has* a strategic location, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a *primary* driver of tourism.
* **B: Iñemohenda ha'eha Israel tavaguasu (It's the capital of Israel):** Being the capital is important, but the passage focuses more on its cultural and religious aspects than its political role in attracting tourists.
* **D: Umi heta tenda tembiasakue rapykueréva (Its many luxury shops):** The passage mentions a commercial center, cafes, and restaurants, but doesn't emphasize luxury shopping as a key attraction.

Therefore, the passage most clearly points to Jerusalem's rich cultural offerings as a major factor in its tourism appeal.
"
Mávarepa ko’ãva apytégui noñeñe’ẽi pe pehẽnguépe peteĩ mba’e ojekuaaveha Jerusalén-pe?,"The best answer is **B: Influencia política rupive** (Political Influence).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes Jerusalem's importance as a religious, spiritual, and *cultural* center. While religious influence is highlighted, the passage also states that Jerusalem has been a focal point of conflict and contention throughout history, affecting its political landscape.  This ongoing political influence shapes the city's present-day reality and experiences.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Tembiasakue ojehecharamoitereíva** (Being a highly visited place): While it's a tourist destination, this isn't the *primary* point the passage makes. The passage focuses more on its historical and religious significance.
*   **C: Jeroviapýpe g̃uarã he’iséva** (Being rich in resources): The passage doesn't mention Jerusalem being rich in resources.
*   **D: Umi tenda tekoha rehegua** (Related to housing): The passage doesn't focus on housing issues in Jerusalem.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate choice because it reflects the underlying complexities and historical factors influencing Jerusalem, as suggested by the text.

The text states that a Wild Card allows you to visit multiple South African National Parks. Option A accurately reflects this benefit.  The other options are too specific:

* **B:** A Wild Card isn't just for visiting Kruger.
* **C:** While possible, the text doesn't specifically mention someone visiting *all* parks.
* **D:**  While visiting Kruger *and* another park *is* a valid reason for a Wild Card, the core benefit is the ability to visit *multiple* parks.



"
Mba'e ñe'ẽasãipa nomombe'úi hekopete Parque Nacional Kruger rehegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Oje’e ha’eha mba'e ojehecharamovéva Sudáfrica- pe**.

* **Option B** is true, but not the *most* prominent information.
* **Option C** is incorrect - the text says it's one of the *largest* parks.
* **Option D** is a secondary detail related to visiting the park, but not the main point the text emphasizes.

Therefore, option A best captures a key piece of information about Parque Nacional Kruger according to the provided text.

The passage states that the steep mountain and the height (4500 meters) make it dangerous for hikers. It further mentions the use of steel cables for safety, indicating that there *is* danger. The question asks what is particularly dangerous for hikers on the steep paths.  Therefore, ""He'ojave"" (Yes) is the appropriate response.



"

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Oñemoĩ escalón itaguigua tape tuichavéva pukukue, ha umi hasyveha ojejupi hag̃uame oñemoĩ cable de acero oikóva ñandepojái hag̃ua.

(Steps are built along the path, and the stairs are equipped with steel cables for support. However, this is still challenging and one can easily slip and quickly be in danger.) This directly points to the danger of climbing the stairs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi jupihára ikatupyrýva jepe oiméne ipytupátavaicha** (The hikers can still see it as described) - While true, it doesn't address the *danger* of the stairs.
* **B: Ndaipóri jejokoha umi tenda hasyvehápe ojejupi hag̃ua** (There are no restrictions on climbing the stairs) - The text clearly indicates there *are* restrictions and dangers.
* **C: Rehasavaʼerã peteĩ itakuárupi oĩva yvate gotyo** (You can see a structure located higher up) -  This relates to what you *see*, not the danger of climbing.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

Here's why:

The question asks what is missing from the traditional Mallorcan bread (Pa amb Oli) in other places. The text describes Pa amb Oli as bread with olive oil, tomato, and other ingredients.  The question highlights that Mallorca-based Pa amb Oli incorporates vegetables (specifically, the tomato is a key vegetable). Therefore, vegetables are what's commonly missing in other versions.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what is *not* mentioned about geothermal hot springs.**
* **Option D** directly states a fact mentioned in the passage: many places in Rotorua use geothermal hot springs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hangi geotérmico-pe pozo oñembyaku ita akúpe peteĩ ñemyandypeguáva:** This is explicitly mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Hangi oiporúva ita hakúva ojeguereko Wellington-pe:** While the passage mentions hot springs in Wellington, it doesn't say specifically that *the hot springs are used there*. It mentions other hot springs are used in Wellington.
* **C: Hangi ojeiporu jepi oñembojy haguã peteĩ cena jepiverõguáicha ñembichy estilo-pe:** This is also explicitly mentioned in the passage as a way hot springs are utilized.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that is directly and accurately supported by the provided text."
Mávapa ko’ã mba’e apytégui ndoje’éi ha’eha peteĩ forma típica oñembyaku hag̃ua pe Hangi pit?,"The correct answer is **C: Mba’eraku geotérmica (Geothermal vents)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes a Hangi being cooked with geothermal heat. 
* Geothermal vents are a direct source of this heat. 
* The passage explicitly states that the Hangi is cooked in a style similar to a regular dinner, suggesting the heat source is a natural phenomenon like geothermal activity.
* Options A and B (""Gas"" and ""Ita hakúva"" - likely meaning ""wood/fire"") are possible, but the passage heavily emphasizes the geothermal aspect of Hangi cooking, making geothermal vents the most *typical* heat source.
* Option D (""Ita hakúva"" - likely meaning ""wood/fire"") is mentioned as a source for hangi in other cities, but the primary focus of the passage is on geothermal hangi.

Therefore, a geothermal vent is the most fitting and typical way a Hangi is heated, according to the text.
"
Mba’épa ikatúne peteĩ monje térã monja jehechakuaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Emondévo peteĩ ao ojejaho’i verapáva (When a vow is taken)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a ritual where monks and nuns take vows, and their robes are symbolic of this commitment. The question asks what a monk or nun can recognize or understand.  The act of taking a vow is a central and important element of their life, and therefore something they would recognize and understand.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ejaho’ivo nde ati’y (They will give you their life):** While dedication is part of their life, it doesn't directly relate to recognizing a specific event or practice.
*   **C: Eiporúvo peteĩ ao monasterio-gui (When they leave the monastery):** Leaving the monastery is a significant event, but not something they *recognize* in the moment; it’s something that happens.
*   **D: Emonde peteĩ sái oñeikytĩva tetymy’ã ári rupi (When they make a promise in the presence of a holy person):** This is related to promises, but the core event the text focuses on is the taking of vows, not a general promise to a holy person.



"
Mávapa ko’ã ao apytépe ndaha’éi oiméne ojeipurukuaáva peteĩ monasterio-pe? ,"The correct answer is **C: Kasõmbuku**.

The text explicitly mentions that monks and nuns often wear a *kasõmbuku* (a type of long, loose robe). The question asks what is *not* typically worn in a monastery.  *Kasõmbuku* is a common garment, so it's not what wouldn't be worn.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Saikuéra (Socks):** While nuns might wear socks, it's not a defining or essential garment associated with monasteries like *kasõmbuku* or a habit.
* **B: Kasõmbyky (A specific type of tunic):** Similar to *kasõmbuku*, monks and nuns often wear *kasõmbyky*.
* **D: Aho’iha (A type of head covering):**  Monks and nuns *do* wear head coverings, although the text doesn't specify a particular type.



Therefore, *kasõmbuku* is the most logical answer because it's a common garment found within monasteries. The question asks what is NOT typically worn, so it cannot be *kasõmbuku*.
"
Arakaʼépa peteĩ visitante oguerekóta hetave oportunidad ohecha hag̃ua umi mbyja ovisita aja umi tenda Antártica-pegua?,"The correct answer is **C: Araro’y jave**.

* The question asks about the opportunities to see the aurora when visiting Antarctic lodges.
* The answer ""Araro’y jave"" (usually/often) aligns with the text highlighting the *opportunity* to see the aurora as a significant aspect of visiting these lodges.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Arakaʼépa peteĩ visitante oguerekóta hetave oportunidad ohecha hag̃ua umi mbyja ovisita aja umi tenda Antártica-pegua?** (What opportunity does a visitor have to see the aurora when visiting Antarctic lodges?) - This is a rephrasing of the question itself, not an answer.
* **B: Pe tendápe ndojeikoguasúi jave** (You can't go to the lodge) - The text focuses on the *opportunity* to see the aurora, not on access to the lodge itself.
* **D: Sa’ive jave pe contaminación lumínica tesape rehegua** (Because of the light pollution) - The text explicitly states that the lack of light pollution is *beneficial* for seeing the stars and aurora.  Therefore, light pollution isn't a hindrance, but an advantage.

Araka’épa peteĩ pumbyry satélite rupivegua ndaikatuichéne omyengovia peteĩ pumbyrýpe?,"The correct answer is **A: Oiméramo ojejoko pe línea de visión satélite rehegua (When the satellite line of sight is blocked)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Peteĩ pumbyry satelital, jepivéramo ndaha'éi oñemongovia haguã pumbyrymýi, oikotevẽ rupi oĩ aire libre-hápe peteĩ jehecha porãme ikatu haguãicha satélite ojapo peteĩ ñehenói pumbyry rupive.""  This translates to: ""A satellite, even if not blocking the view of the target, is visible in the clear air as if the satellite is making a connection to the target through a ray of light.""

This implies that a direct line of sight is necessary. If something is blocking the satellite's path to the target (like a building or the tent mentioned in the passage), the connection (or ""ñehenói pumbyry rupive"" - ray from the satellite) will be broken, and the satellite won't be able to communicate with the target.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe tenda oĩramo mombyryeterei (The tent is blocking the view):** While the tent *could* block the view, the passage doesn't say this is the *reason* a satellite might not connect. It's presented as one possible scenario. The more general reason is the blocked line of sight.
* **C: Ojeiporútaramo okápe (It's being redirected):** The passage doesn't mention redirection as a reason for a satellite not connecting.
* **D: Peteĩ expedición oikotevẽramo datos (An expedition is gathering data):**  Data gathering is a function of a satellite, not a reason it wouldn't connect to a target.

Therefore, the blocked line of sight (option A) is the most accurate and general explanation based on the provided text.
"

Here's why:

* **The passage describes satellite phones as working by establishing a connection with a satellite.** The question asks *when* a satellite phone works well.
* **Option D directly addresses the core function of a satellite phone:**  It needs a coverage area to function.  If the phone is within that area, it will work well.
* **Options A, B, and C are incorrect:**
    * **A (Ojepytu’u aja peteĩ távape - ""When it's in a city""):**  While satellite phones can be used in cities, it's not the *defining* factor for good performance. Performance depends more on satellite coverage.
    * **B (Peteĩ viaje ojejapo aja ygápe - ""When a trip is taken by boat""):**  Similar to A, a trip by boat *can* use a satellite phone, but it's not the defining factor for good performance.
    * **C (Natekotevẽi jave umi dato mombyrygua - ""When satellite data is not available""):**  This is the *opposite* of what's needed for good performance. If data isn't available, the phone won't work.

Mba’e rehegua ñorãirõpa ko'ãva apytégui ogueruva’ekue República de Transnistria ñemoheñói?,"The correct answer is **A: Virurekopy (Political)**.

The text states that the Republic of Transnistria was established in 1994 due to **political** unrest within Moldova. The text mentions ""virureko mokõiveguio Moldovia vore"" which translates to ""political unrest within Moldova"".
"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytégui oguereko República de Transnistria iñambuéva Moldavia-gui?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Virutee**.

The text states: ""1994-pe ko apañuãi rupi oñemoheñói ijeheguieténte ojeherova República de Transnistria, Moldovia este gotyo, **oguerekóva ipokatu ha ivirutee**..."" which translates to ""In 1994, due to this conflict, the breakaway territory of the Republic of Transnistria was established in Moldova, **possessing its own government and armed forces**...""

Therefore, the reason Transnistria was established is because of a **virutee** (conflict/war).

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, araka’épa peteĩ viajero ovisitava’erã Montevideo ani hag̃ua oho yvytu jave?","The correct answer is **C: Hemisferio Norte gotyo arahaku jave (When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""jasy arahaku aja, arapytu ikatujepiohasa + 30 °"" which translates to ""During summer, the temperature can reach +30°"". 

Since the Northern Hemisphere's summer is in December-February, and the Southern Hemisphere is in June-August,  when it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it's winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, Montevideo (in the Southern Hemisphere) experiences its coldest temperatures during the Northern Hemisphere's summer.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, araka’épa peteĩ viajero ovisita va’erã Montevideo ha’éramo parcial peteĩ clima ro’ysãvévape?","The correct answer is **A: Oguahẽvo arahaku Montevideo-pe** (When the traveler arrives in Montevideo).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Montevideo is located in the subtropics. 
* It further explains that the temperature there is relatively stable throughout the year, with no extreme hot or cold periods. 
* The average temperature is around +30°C.
* The humidity and wind can influence the perceived temperature, but the base climate remains subtropical.

Therefore, the traveler experiences the subtropical climate *when they arrive in Montevideo*. The other options are incorrect because:

* **B:** The traveler arriving in the Northern Hemisphere isn't relevant to Montevideo's climate.
* **C:** The text states there isn't a distinct ""hot"" or ""cold"" season, so the temperature isn't necessarily lower when the traveler arrives.
* **D:**  The text places Montevideo in the subtropics, not the Northern Hemisphere.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko'ãva apytégui oñembojoajúta peteĩ artista grafiti rehegua ndive, ndojoajúiva vandalismo rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Mural ndojeipotáiva tenda público-pe**

Here's why:

* The text explains that graffiti is often associated with vandalism (using aerosols to deface public and private property). 
* It then states that graffiti is evolving and becoming accepted when done on ""legal"" walls (meaning walls that are permitted for graffiti).
* The question asks how an artist can be recognized without being labeled a vandal. The answer lies in creating *murals* (large, often commissioned artworks) on permitted walls, rather than simply tagging (writing signatures) on property without permission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi mba’e ojehúva grafiti rehegua (Things related to graffiti):** This is too broad. It doesn't address the core issue of how an artist can be distinguished from a vandal.
* **B: Ojehaívo garabato-kuéra (When they draw scribbles):**  While scribbles *can* be a starting point, the text highlights that graffiti is more than just scribbles; it's an art form that can be accepted when done legally.
* **D: Umi etiqueta noñemoñe’ẽporãiva (The tags are not understandable):**  The readability of tags is irrelevant to whether the art is considered vandalism or legitimate graffiti.  Tags are often signatures.

Mba’emba’épa umi festival de música-pe ohóva oguerekove en cuenta osẽ porã hag̃ua chupe pe tembiapo?,"The correct answer is **C: Mba’epu ñembopu pyhare pyte peve** (They set up their tents far away).

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where people at a music festival are having trouble because the main stage is crowded, and the camping area for those who want to camp is located far away, ""vore opurahéiva gueteri pyhare pyte peve"" (far beyond the edge of the forest). 

Therefore, option C, ""They set up their tents far away,"" accurately reflects this problem. The other options don't align with the text's description of people having to camp a long distance from the main events.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa omotenondeva’erã peteĩ ohóva festival-pe oacampasérõ hi’ag̃uĩ pe mba’epúgui?","The correct answer is **B: Opytávo peteĩ tenda oĩháme ogayguakuéra**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a common practice at festivals:** People often camp in tents designed for groups.
* **The question asks what people do when camping at a festival:**  The passage implies this is a typical setup for camping at festivals.
* **Option B directly reflects this idea.**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Oho pyhare pyte (Go to the side):** While people might sometimes camp on the periphery, the passage focuses on group camping and specialized tents.
* **C: Oacampa ambue tendápe (Camp in another tent):** This is possible, but not the common or implied solution described in the passage.
* **D: Oñeg̃uahẽ voi (Just go):** This is too vague and doesn't address the practical aspect of festival camping.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, moõpa ndohoiva’erã umi visitante ohekávo pyharegua aporã Nuevo México norte-pe?","The correct answer is **D: Casino-kuéra**.

Here's why:

The question asks where visitors can find good entertainment in Northern New Mexico. The passage explicitly states: ""haimete mayma casino-kuéra oje'e va'ekue oguereko jey'urã, ha heta jey oguereko entretenimiento iporãva"" which translates to ""However, the casinos are said to have a lot of entertainment.""

While the passage mentions bars in small towns (option B), it also emphasizes the casinos as a primary source of entertainment. Option A (travel) and Option C (guides) are not direct answers to where to *find* entertainment.



"
"Heʼiháicha pe pehẽnguépe, moõpa ojuhuvéta peteĩ visitante umi vyʼarã ojekuaáva Nuevo México norte-pe?","The correct answer is **D: Peteĩ bar táva michĩvape** (In a small town bar).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...bar-kuéra oĩva umi táva michĩvévape ndaha'éi katuete tenda iporãva visitante ambue estado-gua ohasa haguã."" ( ""...bars exist in small town establishments, not necessarily the fancy establishments that out-of-state visitors pass through."")  This indicates a small town bar is a possible place to find a unique experience.  The text then mentions that many bartenders recommend visiting these bars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ casino-pe mokõi aravo Albuquerque-gui** (In a casino two days from Albuquerque) - While the text mentions casinos, it doesn't say a visitor *must* go to one from Albuquerque.
* **B: Peteĩ táva mombyryguápe** (In a tourist establishment) -  The text contrasts tourist establishments with the smaller town bars.
* **C: Peteĩ casino Sante Fe ypýpe** (In a casino near Santa Fe) - The text mentions casinos, but doesn't specify a location near Santa Fe.



"
Mba’eichagua ñemboy’urã oñeha’ãta ani hag̃ua ho’u umi viajero oikuaáva ipirapire sa’iha?,"The correct answer is **A: Vino Australia-gua (Australian wine)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Oĩ heta vino Francia-gua, katu vino-kuéra Nueva Zelanda ha Australia-gua ikatu oho porãve."" which translates to ""There are many French wines, but wines from New Zealand and Australia are very good."" This directly highlights Australian wine as something travelers should try.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Y embotelladova (Bottled beer):** The text mentions ""Manta"" beer but doesn't specifically recommend it. It only says it's another beer.
* **C: Cerveza upe tendapegua (Beer from that tap):**  The text mentions ""Number One"" beer and ""Manta"" beer, but doesn't recommend the tap beer specifically.
* **D: Yva rykue (Red wine):** The text mentions red wine as being ""very good,"" but it's not as direct a recommendation as the Australian wine. It's presented more as a general observation.



Therefore, **Australian wine** is the most strongly recommended item for travelers to try based on the provided text.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Peteĩ hũ mbyky, 'espresso' capuchino henyhẽ crema-gui (ndahyjúi), ha te ojeitykua kamby'ỹre."" This translates to: ""A small espresso cappuccino with crema (without foam), and topped with milk.""

The question asks what a waiter would likely bring if asked about the listed items.  Of the options, ""Peteĩ hũ mbykyva"" directly corresponds to the described espresso cappuccino.  The other options are specific brands of beer, wine, or a type of coffee that are not directly mentioned as something a waiter would typically serve in response to a general inquiry.

"Ojepysóva mbohapy siglo pukukue, mba'e aty omoñepyrũva’ekue pe periodo de colonización?","The correct answer is **D: Umi España-gua**.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼéicha ikatu ojejapo peteĩ parisino pya’e ojepokuaa hag̃ua nderehe?","The correct answer is **D: Ehechauka nderoryha opavavéndi (They show you their smile)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Parisians are known for being friendly and welcoming. It specifically mentions that they quickly show their smile to make others feel welcome and comfortable. Option D directly reflects this behavior described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eñeha’ã umi Paris-gua reko (They are known for their manners):** While Parisians might have good manners, the text emphasizes the smile as a key welcoming gesture.
*   **B: Ejeroviaukava’erã ndejehe (They are polite to you):** Similar to A, politeness is mentioned but not the defining characteristic of a quick welcome as described in the text.
*   **C: Eikokuaa jepoyhúpe (They are good at speaking):** The text doesn't mention language skills as the primary way Parisians welcome people. While they might speak, the smile is the main focus.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko'ãva apytégui noñeconsiderái cualidad estereotipada umi Paris-gua rehegua?","The correct answer is **D: Jehechakuaa (Stereotyping)**.

Here's why:

The text describes the Parisians as being critical, judgmental, and quick to judge visitors. The phrase ""Umi parisino rekove katui iñambuéta pya’eterei ehechaukáramo chupekuéra ejehekombo’eporãha"" translates to ""Parisians are quick to judge when they see you."" This clearly indicates a tendency to make assumptions and form opinions based on stereotypes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jejapo (Work/Creation):** This doesn't relate to the description of the Parisians' behavior.
*   **B: Tie’ỹreko (Inflexible):** While Parisians might be perceived as somewhat inflexible, the text focuses more on their judgmental nature.
*   **C: Tory (Arrogant):** While arrogance could be *part* of the stereotype, the text focuses more on the quick judgment and critical attitude.

Therefore, **Jehechakuaa (Stereotyping)** is the most accurate description of the phenomenon described in the text.



"
Mba’épa peteĩ beneficio First Class rehegua ome’ẽva MetroRail Cabo távapegua?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndahepyive peteĩ boleto tercera clase-peguágui** (You don't need a third-class ticket).

Here's why:

* The passage states that MetroPlus (which includes First Class) offers more comfort and service, and that it's for those who are willing to pay more.
* It specifically mentions that tickets for MetroPlus and Metro are more expensive than tickets purchased in Europe.
* Option C directly reflects the implication that First Class offers a way to avoid the cheaper third-class ticket.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe autocar oĩ pe tren renondépe** (The bus is on the train) - This is irrelevant to the benefit of First Class.
* **B: Ndahetaitereíri tapicha** (It carries more people) - The passage doesn't mention capacity being a benefit of First Class.
* **D: Peteĩ boleto metro-peguáichante ovale** (An oval ticket for the metro) - This is simply incorrect; the passage doesn't mention anything about the shape of the tickets.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa oreko opa tren mohi'aguĩva Cabo távapegua?","The correct answer is **B: Peteĩchaite boleto repykue mokõive clase-pe g̃uarã (A single ticket for different classes)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Metrorail oguereko mokõichagua tren mohi'aguĩva Cabo távape ha ijerére; MetroPlus (ojeikuaáva avei First Class-ramo) ha Metro (ojeheróva Third Class-ramo) MetroPlus oguerekove comodidad ha sa'ive tapicha oĩ pype, katu hepymiẽ, katu hepy sa'ive gueteri umi billete ojehepyme'ẽva Europa-pegui.""

This translates to: ""Metrorail has two trains running in and out of Cabo; MetroPlus (also known as First Class) and Metro (offering Third Class) MetroPlus provides comfort and seats for passengers, but it is more expensive, and the ticket price is higher than those purchased in Europe.""

The key takeaway is that MetroPlus and Metro offer different classes (First and Third), implying you can have a ticket for different classes.  Option B accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ vagón Metro-pegua sa'ive henyhẽva (A Metro wagon with a seat) ** While some wagons might have seats, the text doesn't mention this as a universal feature of *all* trains.
* **C: Mbohapy clase iñambuéva (Third class available)**  The text mentions Third class specifically in the context of the ""Metro"" train, but it doesn't say it's available on *every* train.
* **D: Mokõive autocar ha’éva primera ha tercera clase-gua (A single bus that is First and Third class)** The text mentions buses (""autocar"") but it doesn't link them to First and Third class specifically. It just mentions that Metrorail has trains and buses.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ikatúne ndojapói peteĩ mymba plaga?,"The correct answer is **D: Oproduci umi lesión ijetu’úva (Produce itchy lesions)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how pests can cause itching, irritation, allergic reactions, and rashes. All of these manifest as *lesions* or bumps/sores on the skin.  Option D, ""Oproduci umi lesión ijetu’úva"" directly translates to ""Produce itchy lesions"" which aligns perfectly with the descriptions provided.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **A: Oporomonguru (Cause allergies)** While allergies *can* be a reaction to pests, the text doesn't specifically say the pests *cause* allergies. It states allergic reactions as a symptom.
* **B: Omboalergia (Produce allergies)** Similar to A, this is a symptom, not the primary way a pest creates a problem.
* **C: Oñemosarambi peteĩ mba’asy (Cause infection)** The text mentions infectious diseases, but also other problems pests can cause *without* directly being infectious. It's not the central point.



Therefore, the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text is **D**."
Moõpa ikatu ojejogua umi pumbyry tarjeta jehepyme’ẽmbyrémava?,"The answer is **D: Umi pumbyry público oĩháme (At public transport stops)**.

Here's why:

The text mentions that many cards are available for purchase and that some offer discounted fares for people traveling between cities. It then asks where a single card can be purchased that allows access to all types of public transport (bus and train).

Therefore, the most logical location to purchase such a card is **at public transport stops**. Options A, B, and C are too specific and don't encompass all forms of public transport mentioned in the text.
"
Mba’éichapa ojeiporukuaa umi tasa de llamada omachavéva oikuave’ẽva algunas tarjetas?,"The correct answer is **B: Umi papapy reiguáva rupive (From the calling cards)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...oĩ katu ojeporúva ome’ẽvo tarifa ñehenóirã umi aty oñemoneĩmbyréva tetãnguéra hárupi."" ( ""...there are also those that offer lower rates for companies that make calls within the country."")
* **It then discusses a ""pumbyry papapy ojehepyme’ẽ’ỹva guive..."" (a calling card that is combined/linked... )** and the ability to use it for calls.

This implies that the rate-saving is associated with *using a specific calling card*, not necessarily a physical location or a public phone. Therefore, the rates are tied to the calling card itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oĩnte tetã ikatuha ojeiporu (There is a public phone booth)** - While a public phone booth *could* be used, the text doesn't mention a public phone booth specifically offering lower rates. The focus is on calling cards.
* **C: Pe ñemuha esquina-peguápe (At the corner)** - This is irrelevant to how calling cards work.
* **D: Ojeiporúvo pumbyry público ha ojehepyme’ẽvévo michĩmi (When a public phone is used and it is linked)** - Again, the text focuses on calling cards and not public phones.

The text explicitly states: ""Tetã Rekuái okavusu hérava Lagos de Plitvice oguereko heta yvyraty, hetave oĩva hayas, **abetos ha abetos**..."" (The National Park known as Lagos de Plitvice has many trees, many of which are oaks, **firs and spruces**...).
"
Mávapa ko'ã mymba ndahetáiva rehegua apytégui ikatu ojejuhu parque nacional Lagos de Plitvice-pe?,"The correct answer is **D: Urogallo**.

This translates to: ""In it, you can see watchable animals, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and **urogallo**, and many other animals are also seen.""

Therefore, the urogallo is listed as one of the animals found in the Lagos de Plitvice National Park. The other options are not mentioned in the text."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épe añetehápe oipytyvõ umi tendapegua código?","The correct answer is **B: Oñecontrola hag̃ua ñemuha (Control the reproduction)**.

The text states: ""umi tendapegua código ndoguerekói mba'éichagua efecto peteĩ copia ilegal ári: peteĩ copia bit ha bit rehe ombohasa jeykuaa oimeraẽ dispositivo ojejapotahápe ype original.""

Translation: ""the code does not allow any effect on an illegal copy: a bit by bit copy allows the detection of the device being restored from the original.""

This means the code's purpose is to *control* reproduction, specifically to detect and prevent illegal copying.  It doesn't just prevent piracy itself (C), but actively works to control the reproduction process. While it's related to illegal copies (D), the main action is control. Option A (Disco jekopiápe - on disk copying) is too specific; the code isn't *only* about disk copying.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko'ãva apytégui japu umi tendapegua código rehegua ojehejapukúva are guivéma umi empresa momaranduha rupive?","The correct answer is **B: Oipytyvõ ani hag̃ua ojejapo copia ilegal.**

Here's why:

* The text states that the code doesn't allow for the creation of a bit-by-bit copy.  This directly prevents the illegal copying of the software.
* Option B accurately reflects this prevention.  The code's function is to *prevent* the creation of illegal copies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñecontrola porãve hag̃ua ñemuha:** While code *can* be used for monitoring, the primary function described is preventing copying, not control.
* **C: Ha’ekuéra ideprovécho pirapire oñembojere hag̃ua:** The text doesn't mention using piracy for profit.
* **D: Sa’i oipytyvõ ohapejoko hag̃ua piratería:**  The code is *designed to hinder* piracy, not help it.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided text."
"Eg̃uahẽvo ne retãme, mba’e proceso-pa ojejapo vaivaínte?","The correct answer is **A: Umi control inmigración rehegua (Immigration controls)**.

Here's why:

* **P's question** asks about the process involved when someone immigrates to a country and whether it's a true control or just a formality. It highlights the importance of customs control.
* **Q's question** asks what happens *upon entering the country*.
* **Option A** directly addresses this by mentioning ""immigration controls"" (umí control inmigración), which is the most relevant and encompassing answer to what happens upon entry.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ojedeclara umi mba’e rehegua (Things are declared)** - While declaration is part of the process, it's not the *entire* process of entering the country.
* **C: Umi límite legal mba’ekuéra rehegua (Regarding legal limits)** - This refers to legal boundaries, not the process of immigration itself.
* **D: Aduana-pegua jejesareko (Customs control)** - This is a specific *part* of immigration control, but not the encompassing process.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and complete answer to Q's question based on the context of P's question.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks how to find out about immigration procedures upon entering a country.
* **The initial text (P)** states that immigration control might not exist or might be a formality, but it mentions customs control to avoid problems. It also highlights the importance of informing authorities upon arrival.
* **Option A** directly addresses the question by stating the presence of an immigration checkpoint, which is a common place to inquire about procedures.
* **Options B, C, and D** are less direct or incomplete answers. Option B focuses on informing authorities, which is a consequence of entering, not the primary way to find out about procedures. Options C and D describe potential scenarios (customs, missing items) but don't directly address how to find information about immigration procedures.



Therefore, the most logical and direct answer based on the given text is that there's an immigration control checkpoint."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’e oĩ hetávapa opermiti umi jupihárape umi tape pyahu jejuhu Cochamó Valle ryepýpe?","The correct answer is **A: Oñemaña hag̃ua (By permit)**.

The text states that climbers who want to climb in Cochamó Valley have to obtain a permit (""tape pyahu""). Therefore, they are permitted to climb *by permit*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yvytyru’ãnguéra (Bears)**:  While bears might be present, the question is about permits for climbing, not bears.
* **C: Umi pico (Peaks)**:  The text mentions peaks (""cumbre-kuérape""), but it doesn't say climbing is permitted *by* the peaks themselves.
* **D: Tapiakuéra (Ropes)**: Ropes are climbing equipment, not a permit.

"Oñemopyendáva marandu oñeme'ẽva pe pehẽnguépe rehe, mávapa ocubri hetave cruce Hemisferio Sur-pe?","The correct answer is **B: Star Aliance**.

This translates to: ""There is no airline alliance connecting three oceanic crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not connect any of these crossings, Star Alliance connects, flying from Santiago de Chile east to Tahiti in the South Pacific, and LATAM Oneworld).""

Therefore, Star Alliance is explicitly mentioned as the only alliance connecting at least one oceanic crossing in the Southern Hemisphere.  The other options are either explicitly ruled out (SkyTeam) or refer to a specific route/company, not an alliance connecting multiple crossings.
"
Mba'e alianza aerolínea-pa ocubri sa'ive umi cruce océano Hemisferio Sur-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Aliance**.

The text explicitly states: ""Star Aliance aimete og̃uahẽmba, nog̃uahẽi Santiago de Chile este gotyo, Pacífico Sur-pe Tahiti-peve..."" which translates to ""Star Alliance operates, connecting from Santiago de Chile eastwards, to Tahiti in the South Pacific..."" This confirms that Star Alliance is the alliance that operates transatlantic crossings in the Southern Hemisphere.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Pacífico Sur** is a geographical location, not an airline alliance.
*   **C: LATAM Oneworld** is an airline (LATAM) that is part of the Oneworld alliance, and while it operates flights in the South Pacific, the text doesn't say it's the *only* or primary alliance for transatlantic crossings.
*   **D: SkyTeam** is mentioned as *not* operating any transatlantic crossings in the Southern Hemisphere.

Therefore, Go Running Tours is an organization that operates in the same field as Global Running Tours. The other options refer to specific locations of Running Tours, not the overarching organization.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, Go Running Tours oipytyvõ ombojoaju hag̃ua, mboy organización carrera jehecha rehegua iñambuévapa?","The correct answer is **A: Irundy (Many)**.

The text states: ""Heta jey oiko ijeheguínte"" which translates to ""There are many of them"" or ""Many exist"".  This directly answers the question of how many organizations Go Running Tours helps.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 200** - This refers to the number of cities the tours cover, not the number of organizations Go Running Tours helps.
* **C: Heta docena (Many dozens)** - While ""heta jey"" implies a large number, ""heta docena"" isn't the accurate translation and doesn't directly answer the question.
* **D: Mbohapy (Three)** - The text doesn't mention three organizations.

The text states: ""León, guepardo ha leopardo-kuéra sapy'ánte hi'otĩ ha rehecha porãvéta binocular rehe."" This translates to: ""Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are spotted and can be seen well with binoculars.""

Therefore, a tourist would use binoculars to see a cheetah clearly.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa omboguejýne peteĩ recorrido repy?","The correct answer is **C: Rehórõ ambue ne rapicha ndive** (Removing other people from your group).

Here's why:

The text states that the initial group is too large and hinders interaction between people. The goal of the ""recorrido"" (tour) is to encourage more interaction. Removing other people from the group is the direct way to achieve this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rehórõ neaño** (Removing your year/age): This doesn't relate to the problem of group size hindering interaction.
* **B: Rejuhúvo peteĩ aty irundy tapicha oĩha** (Reforming a group with two people):  This might be *a* solution, but it doesn't address the issue of large groups.
* **D: Rejuhúvo peteĩ aty oĩha poteĩ térã hetave tapicha** (Reforming a group with one or many people): This is the opposite of what the text describes; it's saying to make the group larger.

The question asks what happens when someone is ""ñeikundaha hepy’ive atyguasúpe"" (unfamiliar with social gatherings). The text states: ""upévare reimérõ ne añonte térã peteĩ ne angirũ ndive, eñeha’ã eñomoirũ ambue tapicha ndive peñembyatývo po térã poteĩ ikatu hag̃uaicha peteĩ teĩ pehepyme’ẽ’ive.""  This translates to: ""therefore, when you are introduced or at the beginning, you tend to mingle with other people when someone offers you a drink or when you are alone at a small gathering.""

Option A directly reflects this: ""Akói umi turista oku'e rupi omyanyhẽ hag̃ua peteĩ mba'yrumýi"" which translates to ""when a tourist offers you a drink"".  This is a common scenario where someone unfamiliar with social gatherings might be introduced to others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Peñembyatývo mbohapy tapicha** (when mingling with three people): The text doesn't specify the number of people involved.
* **C: Reimérõ peteĩ ne angirũ ndive** (when being introduced at the beginning):  While this can be a starting point, it's not the *result* of being unfamiliar with social gatherings; it's a *potential scenario*.
* **D: Peñembyatývo po tapicha** (when mingling with people): Similar to B, it doesn't specify the number of people.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jepéramo San Francisco viru reko oĩ peteĩ atracción turística de clase mundial-ramo, iviru reko oku’e heta mba’e rupive.""  This directly translates to ""San Francisco is a world-class tourist attraction, and the guidebooks mention many things.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Py’ỹi ha heta oĩrupi opaichagua arte ha medio de comunicación (Small and numerous arts and media)** - While San Francisco has a vibrant arts scene, the passage doesn't highlight this as the *primary* reason for its global recognition.
* **B: Umi tenda iporãvéva ojejapohápe amandaje (Luxury hotels because of their splendor)** - While San Francisco has luxury hotels, this isn't the main reason for its global appeal, according to the passage.
* **D: Umi tenda tembi’u Asia-pegua oĩ hetahápe (The presence of Asian shops is abundant)** - The passage mentions Asian shops but doesn't emphasize this as a key driver of its global recognition.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe-pe, mávapa umi mba'e oje'éva San Francisco rehe ndaha'éiva añeteguáva?","The correct answer is **A: Py’ỹi ojehechaukájepi umi ta’ãngamýi ha aranduka (It's difficult to navigate the streets and the city)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes San Francisco's many attractions, professional services, infrastructure, and international connections. Option A, ""It's difficult to navigate the streets and the city,"" is the *only* point mentioned in the text as a potential negative or difficulty that might deter tourists.  The other options are either positive aspects (B, C) or not directly mentioned as drawbacks (D).
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'eichagua viajero-pe noipytyvõichéne oiporúvo umi servicio agente de viajes oikuave’ẽva?","The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ viajero ipy’amokõiva (A traveler who is unsure/hesitant)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how travel agents can help with various aspects of planning a trip, including:

*   **Hotel recommendations:**  Offering alternatives to specific hotels or even suggesting camping.
*   **Package deals:**  Providing transportation (airport transfers), hotels, and sometimes even tours in a single package.
*   **Document assistance:**  Helping with visa applications or other necessary documents.
*   **Alternatives to hotels:**  Suggesting options beyond traditional hotels.

The question asks *who* benefits from these services.  The text implies that people who are not sure about the details or overwhelmed by the planning process are the ones who would particularly benefit from the assistance of a travel agent. They might be hesitant or unsure how to proceed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Peteĩ viajero ojapóva sapy’a opa mba’e (A traveler who does everything themselves):** This contradicts the purpose of a travel agent. A travel agent is meant to *help* those who *don't* want to do everything themselves.
*   **C: Peteĩ viajero ndoguerekóiva gueteri ivisa (A traveler who doesn't need a visa):** While visa assistance is a service, it's not the defining characteristic of *who* needs help. Anyone planning an international trip could benefit from visa guidance.
*   **D: Peteĩ viajero oiporavóva paquete ndahepyivéva (A traveler who chooses an incomplete package):**  The text focuses on the services travel agents *offer*, not on traveler choices or incomplete packages.

Therefore, option A best reflects the target audience for the travel agent's services.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndoje’éi pe pehẽnguépe ha’eha peteĩ beneficio ojejapórõ reserva peteĩ agente de viajes rupive?,"The correct answer is **C: Umi paquete opa mba’e oguerekóva (Packages with everything included)**.

Here's why:

The text describes that travel agencies offer packages that include transportation (flights, ground transport), accommodation (hotels or camping), and sometimes even assistance with visas.  Option C directly reflects this benefit: getting everything bundled together into one package.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kuatia viaje rehegua pya’eve osẽ (Quick travel arrangements):** While travel agencies *can* arrange travel quickly, it's not the *primary* benefit highlighted in the text.
* **B: Umi oferta hotel rehegua (Hotel offers):** The text mentions hotels, but the core benefit of using an agency is the comprehensive package, not just hotel deals.
* **D: Omotenondévo peteĩ reserva (Handling a reservation):**  While agencies handle reservations, this is a basic function and not the unique benefit they provide compared to booking independently.

Here's why:

The text mentions that current translation apps struggle with punctuation.  Option A directly addresses this weakness. The other options aren't weaknesses of current translation apps.

*   **B: Ombohasapaite umi jehaipyre vore (They translate verb tenses)** - While verb tense translation can be tricky, it's not the primary weakness highlighted in the text.
*   **C: Ombohasa jehaipyre umi mba’e rehe pumbyry iñarandúva rupive (They translate things based on highly complex rules)** - Translation apps don't rely on *highly complex* rules, but rather statistical models and machine learning, which are prone to errors with nuances.
*   **D: Ombohasa hekopete 100% pe aravoitépe (They translate with 100% accuracy)** - This is simply not true of any translation app, and the text acknowledges errors exist.

Mbaʼépa opermiti ojejapo umi ñe’ẽasa conexión’ỹre?,"The correct answer is **C: Oñemboguejývo umi dato ñe’ẽnguéra rehegua (Data translation)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Google Translate, ohejáva ojejapo ñe’ẽasa conexión-ỹre oñemboguejy rire dato- kuéra ñe’ẽ ojeipotávagui."" which translates to ""Google Translate, which performs translation with a connection, by retrieving data of the language being typed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi tembiporu ñe’ẽasa rehegua oñemyatyrõva (Translation services)** - While true, this is too general. The question is about *what* the connection allows.
* **B: Umi pumbyry iñarandúva rehegua (Advanced keyboards)** - The text doesn't mention advanced keyboards.
* **D: Umi aplicación oĩva umi categoría ñe’ẽasa ojejapova aravo teépe ryepýpe (Applications in the translation category)** - This describes the *category* of apps, not *what* a connection allows.

This translates to ""Sometimes, a warm sun melts the snow, then other snowfalls, other natural events, and **volcanic eruptions**.""

Earthquakes are a known trigger for avalanches. While other options might indirectly contribute, earthquakes are a direct and powerful initiating force.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui oguejy avalancha-kuéraicha?","The correct answer is **C: Umi volumen hembýva nieve rehegua pendiente yvatépe**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Umi pendiente yvate ikatu ojoko sapy'a umi volumen hembýva ha oguejýtava avalancha-ramo."" (The higher slopes hold a mass of snow that can slide and trigger an avalanche.)
* **The question asks:** ""He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui oguejy avalancha-kuéraicha?"" (As it is said in the text, what is it from above that triggers avalanches?)

Option C directly reflects this:  ""Umi volumen hembýva nieve rehegua pendiente yvatépe"" translates to ""The mass of snow on the upper slopes."" This is the direct cause of the avalanche as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nieve oja'imi upéva rehe oikotevẽ activación** (Snow is triggered by this activation): This is too general. It doesn't specify *what* triggers the avalanche.
* **B: Umi pendiente yvate ndorekóiva nieve** (The upper slopes without snow):  This is the opposite of what causes an avalanche.
* **D: Nieve ndopokoiva’ekue hese yvypóra** (Snow that doesn't fit those trees): This is irrelevant to the trigger of the avalanche.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, peteĩ curry oñemopyenda mba’e ingrediente rehe?","The correct answer is **B: Ka’avo ha especia-kuéra**.

The text states: ""Peteĩ curry hína peteĩ plato oikóva ka'avo ha especia-kuéra peteĩ so'o térã verdura-kuéra rehe."" This translates to ""A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.""

While yogurt and meat are sometimes used, the core ingredients mentioned as defining a curry are herbs and spices.
"
"Oĩ tenda, sapyʼánte mbaʼe ingrediente curry-pegua rendaguépe ojeiporu kamby mbokajaguigua?","The correct answer is **C: Yogur**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""umi tenda oĩva India ha Paquistán-pe norte gotyo, yogur ojeiporu jepi currype..."" which translates to ""in restaurants in northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is added to the curry...""

While the text mentions meat (""so'o"") and vegetables (""verdura-kuéra"") as possible components of curry, and spices (""especia-kuéra"") as essential ingredients, it explicitly mentions yogurt (""yogur"") as being added to curry in certain regions.

The text states the route takes tractors and sleds to McMurdo Station and then goes via a detour over the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau. This implies the mountains are a necessary part of the route to reach McMurdo Station. The other options don't logically fit the provided context.
"
"Pe Polo Sur Travesía pukukue, mba’épa ojehechauka poyvi rupive?","The correct answer is **A: Pe tape oĩva Estación McMurdo-pe** (The tape located at McMurdo Station).

The text states: ""nieve oñepyrũpyréva **ha ojehechauka bandera rupive**"" which translates to ""snow is piled up **and is shown with a flag**."" The flag is located at McMurdo Station, marking the end of the traverse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi tractor ogueraháva combustible** (The tractors that carry fuel): This describes the means of transportation, not what is displayed at the pole.
* **C: Umi grieta henyhẽva yrypy’aku’ígui** (The cracks in the ice): While the ice might have cracks, the text doesn't mention them being displayed.
* **D: Ipeligroso ojepiaha umi yvyty jerére** (It is dangerous to cross the glaciers): This describes the hazards of the traverse, not what is seen at the pole.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...Visa jejerure repy ha oñeikotevẽva upevarã iñambue peteĩ tetãme ambue hendapeguágui ha he’iséta hína mba’e tetãguipa ojeju."" This refers to the difficulty tourists face in accessing certain areas because of visa requirements and restrictions on travel.
* **Option B aligns with this difficulty:** ""Ojehórõ mba'yrumýime ojevisitakuaa umi tenda ndojehomemeiha"" translates to ""It is difficult to visit the areas where the camps are located.""  This directly connects to the challenges mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi tetã opaichagua oreko hetaichagua visa jejerure ome’ẽ hag̃ua (All countries have many visa requirements):** While visa requirements exist, the text focuses on *difficulties* in obtaining them and restrictions on travel, not just the existence of requirements.
* **C: Haimete opaite tetãnguéra oĩva África sur-pe ykére oĩ porãmba (All countries are equally good in South Africa):** The text doesn't discuss the quality of different countries.
* **D: Oje’e iporãha ojeiporu peteĩ 4x4 ojeviaja-ramo mba'yrumýime (It is recommended to rent a 4x4 to travel through the wilderness):**  The text *mentions* the recommendation for a 4x4, but it's not the primary challenge discussed. It's more of a logistical suggestion.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions needing a high-wheel 4x4** to travel in Southern Africa's wilderness and along rough paths. 
* **The text also refers to choosing a safari lodge** as part of the travel planning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Léi ikatu ojerure umi tembiporu pytyvõ pya’erãoñeikotevẽva mba’yrumýime** - This is too general. While the text mentions laws regarding safari guides, it doesn't directly address advice for tourists *in the wilderness*.
* **C: Mba’yrumýime jeviaja oikoite umi tapicha opiaséva ambue tapérupi** - This is irrelevant. The text isn't discussing tourists who are already staying in other places.
* **D: Ndaopavavéi tetãnguéra oĩva Sudáfrica sur-pe ykére ndaha’éi iporãitereiva ojevisita hag̃ua** - This is incorrect. The text mentions the potential to visit South Africa's southern regions, implying they *can* be visited, just that preparation is necessary.



"
Mávarepa ko’ãva apytégui noñeñe’ẽi pe pehẽnguépe ha’eha peteĩ peligro potencial rehejávo nde vosakuéra oñeñatende’ỹre hese?,"The best answer is **B: Ikatu reikuaa'ỹre oñemboja nderehe reguerahaha droga (Because they suspect you of drug trafficking)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states the reason for the potential danger:** The text describes how people are stopped at the border *suspected* of drug trafficking, which can lead to serious consequences like imprisonment.
* **Option B directly reflects this:** The text says, ""Ikatu oñemondapa umíva reguerahaha droga"" which translates to ""They suspect you of drug trafficking"". This is the direct cause of the potential problem.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ikatu oñemondapa umíva (Because they think you are someone else)** - While possible, the text doesn't suggest mistaken identity.  The focus is on suspicion of a specific crime.
* **C: Ikatu oñeconfundi ambue tapicha mba'e ndive (Because someone confuses you with someone else)** - Same as A, this isn't supported by the text.
* **D: Mburuvichakuéra ikatu ohecha umíva ha'eha peteĩ amenaza potencial bomba reheguáva (Because the police see you as a potential bomb threat)** - The text mentions bomb threats as a *consequence* of drug trafficking, not as the primary reason for the border stop.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and directly supported answer.
"
Mba’épa ndoje’éi pe pehẽnguépe droga jegueraha rehegua?,"The correct answer is **D: Nde voko rehe ojesarekokuaa mburuvichakuéra nderegueraháiramojepe droga.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is *not* mentioned regarding drug trafficking?
* **The passage states:** ""Nde voko rehe ojesarekokuaa mburuvichakuéra nderegueraháiramojepe droga."" which translates to ""You can be punished by the police if you are caught trafficking drugs.""
* **The other options are all mentioned in the passage:**
    * **A:** Mentioned regarding the severity of punishment in other countries.
    * **B:** Mentioned as a reason for people to be caught.
    * **C:** Mentioned as a consequence of getting caught.

Therefore, option D is the only one that *isn't* directly discussed in the passage."

Here's why:

The passage talks about enjoying different types of drinks, specifically mentioning coffee and chamomile tea. The question asks what kind of drink is easy to prepare at home.  Yvarykue (yerba mate) is a very common and easily prepared drink at home in Paraguay and surrounding areas.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Café (Coffee):** While you *can* make coffee at home, it often requires a coffee maker or specific preparation methods that aren't always considered ""easy.""
* **C: Guariryjúi (Passion Fruit Juice):** While you can make passion fruit juice, it involves sourcing and preparing the fruit. It's not as simple as just brewing a drink.
* **D: Pohã rykue (Very Cold):**  This describes a *state* of the drink (coldness) rather than the drink itself.



"
Mávapa ko’ã tenda apytégui revisitava’erã ne vacación aja nde rógape ha nde táva oimérõ herakuãguasu culturajey'urã reheguarupi?,"The correct answer is **B: Yva rykue térã batido oñevendeha (Juice or smoothies are available)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:** The speaker enjoys trying new drinks, including smoothies, while traveling. It also mentions finding cafes and bars.
* **The question asks:**  If they revisited the places they enjoyed on their vacation, considering they are now more interested in cultural experiences. 
* **Option B aligns with the context:** It suggests that juice or smoothies are available, implying that the places the speaker enjoyed might still be there, offering a familiar element while they explore new cultural experiences.  It doesn't necessarily require the exact same *type* of establishment; a place serving juice or smoothies could be a cafe, a bar, or even a restaurant.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Café oje’uha noĩriva nde róga jerére (A cafe is available near your house):** While a cafe *might* be near their house, the question is about revisiting *vacation* spots.
* **C: Umi pub nderehomemeiha (The pubs don't exist):** The passage explicitly states they find pubs in remote towns. This is highly unlikely.
* **D: Umi restaurante ojapohápe té manzanilla-guigua (Restaurants serve chamomile tea):** Chamomile tea is a specific drink, and the passage doesn't highlight it as a key feature of the places the speaker enjoyed. It's also less relevant to a general desire to revisit a place.



"
Moõpa oĩ umi pykasu raʼãnga?,"The correct answer is **B: Cementerio-pe** (In the cemetery).

The text explicitly states: ""Cementerio-pe, oĩ oñemomba’eguasúva mármol-guigua escultura, pykasu oĩva umi panteón ári."" which translates to ""In the cemetery, there is a marble sculpture, a statue on the pantheons.""
"
Mba’eichagua visa oñeme’ẽ hag̃uapa ojejerure peteĩ tapichápe ogueraha hag̃ua umi ojechaukáva ojeguerekoha pe viru rehegua jeykeko?,"The correct answer is **C: Visa jehosapy’arã rehegua (Visa for business)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ikatúramo jepe noñekotevẽi peteĩ visa jehosapy’arã ambue tetãme, turista térã ñemba’aporã..."" (Ikatúramo will issue a visa to another country, for tourist or business purposes...)

Therefore, the question asks what kind of visa is issued when someone applies for a visa to work, and the text explicitly mentions ""ñemba’aporã"" (business) as a reason for obtaining a visa.  Option C directly addresses this.

The other options are not as precise:

* **A: Ñemba’aporã visa rehegua (Visa about business)** - This is too general; it describes information *about* business visas, not the visa itself.
* **B: Turista g̃uarã visa (Tourist visa)** - This is for tourism, not business.
* **D: Temimbo’e ñemoaranduverã visa (Information about visa)** - This is also too general; it's information, not the visa type.



"
Mávapa ikatúne oikotevẽve peteĩ visa ipukuvéva?,"The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ oñemoarandúva ambue tetãme (A person traveling to another country)**.

Here's why:

* The text discusses visas for tourism and business travel.  The question asks *who* needs a visa.
* Option C directly addresses this by stating ""a person traveling to another country.""
* Options A and B are too specific.  While a tourist and a traveler *might* need a visa, the text covers both scenarios.
* Option D, ""a person doing business,"" is also too specific; the text covers business travel generally.



Therefore, the broadest and most accurate answer based on the provided text is C.
"
Mba’éicha javépa oñeñangarekomemeva’erã ñati’ũgui?,"The correct answer is **B: Ojeguata jave**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks ""Mba’éicha javépa oñeñangarekomemeva’erã ñati’ũgui?""** which translates to ""Where does the jaguar come from?"".
* **The passage (P) states ""Arahakúpe jave, eñeñangarekova’erã ñati’ũgui esẽ esẽ ramo eguata selva tropical rehe.""** which translates to ""The jaguar comes from the jungle, it is found in tropical rainforests, and it also appears in tropical subtropical forests when it ventures out of the jungle.""  This directly answers the question about where the jaguar comes from – the jungle.

Therefore, option B, ""Ojeguata jave"" (it appears/is found), is the most accurate response based on the passage. The passage clarifies that the jaguar originates from the jungle (""ñati’ũgui"").
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa nderejapoivaʼerã ani hag̃ua ndeaho’i ñatiʼũ remboguatakuévo pe kaʼaguýrupi?","The correct answer is **D: Ojeheja mba'yrumýi oñeñangareko’ỹre ojeguata aja** (It searches for insects when it rains).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Arahakúpe jave, eñeñangarekova’erã ñati’ũgui esẽ esẽ ramo eguata selva tropical rehe. Upéicha avei ehojave mba’yrumỹime selva tropical subtropical rehe, nerokẽ nerembotýiramo sapya’aitépe oikepaitéta ñati’ũ.""  This translates to: ""The leafcutter ant, when it rains, searches for food in the tropical rainforest. It also goes into the tropical subtropical rainforest, and when it's not raining, it stays in the nest.""

* **Option D directly reflects this behavior:**  The ant specifically searches for food *when it rains*. The other options are incorrect because:
    * **A:**  The passage doesn't say the ant only searches for insects.
    * **B:** The passage states it goes *into* the nest when it's *not* raining, not that it builds a nest.
    * **C:** The passage refers to the *tropical* and *subtropical* rainforests, not specifically to ants coming from subtropical forests.



Therefore, **D** is the only answer consistent with the provided text."

The forest in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park. However, these forests are not only mangrove forests, there are also hardwood forests, formed by the Ganges plain.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ijyvy orekóvagui mbytere ojeaho’i karugua rendápe** (Being flooded with water that floods the land): While the text mentions that a third of the area is flooded, it's not presented as something *not* included in the Sundarbans. It's a characteristic of the region.
* **C: Ha'e cinturón de manglares litorales tuichavéva arapýpe** (It is a wide coastal mangrove belt): This is a defining characteristic of the Sundarbans, not something it *isn't*.
* **D: Ko tendápe oĩ hetave ciervo para umi tigre Bengala-gui** (There are many deer in this area for the Bengal tigers): The text mentions the Bengal tigers, but doesn't imply that the abundance of deer is something *not* part of the Sundarbans ecosystem.
"
Mba'e ka'aguy pehẽnguépa pa oĩ umi India yvy ryepýpe?,"The correct answer is **A: Parque Nacional Sundarbans-pegua**.

The text states: ""Upécharamo jepe, umi ka’aguy ndaha’éi manglares añónte, oĩ avei ipype rodal ipahápe opytáva ka’aguy guasúpe, ymave ojahao’i va’ekue Ganges llanura.

This translates to ""Furthermore, these forests are not only mangroves but also have areas with open forests, and are also formed by the Ganges plain. Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a forest sanctuary, and it is said that there are 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer in this area.""  And the text says ""A: Parque Nacional Sundarbans-pegua"" which means ""National Park Sundarbans"".
"
"Pe pehẽnguépe heʼiháicha, mávapa oiméne oikuaaʼimíjepe inglés ñe’ẽ?","The best answer is **B: Tapichakuéra imitãvéva (Immigrants)**.

Here's why:

* **The text discusses multilingualism and the challenges of communication in a diverse world.** It specifically mentions people from different countries (Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, Sydney, Toronto) coming together.
* **The question asks about who might need to understand English.** The text implies that many immigrants need to understand English to navigate new environments and opportunities.
* **Option B directly addresses this need.** Immigrants are more likely to be in a situation where they need to understand English to integrate into a new society.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Tapichakuéra oñe'ẽva mokõi térã hetave ñe'ẽme (People who speak two or more languages):** While some multilingual people might need to understand English, the text's focus is broader than just multilingualism.
* **C: Yvyporakuéra ohóva Toronto-pe (People living in Toronto):**  Toronto is a diverse city, and not everyone living there needs to understand English.  Many Torontonians are bilingual or speak other languages.
* **D: Tapichakuéra ijedavémava (People who are traveling):**  Travelers might need to understand English, but the text's central theme isn't about travelers. It's about long-term integration and communication in a globalized world.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa oiméne hasy oñembohyapu hag̃ua?","The correct answer is **D: Ñe’ẽ upe tendápente ojeiporúva** (Language used in that context).

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks what makes communication difficult in the scenario described.
* **The passage (P)** emphasizes the challenges arising from:
    * **Different accents** (Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, Sydney)
    * **Different slang** (argot)
    * **The context** (a meeting where people are trying to understand each other)

Therefore, the difficulty isn't just about having many languages (A), or the presence of different people (B), or language being generally used (C). It's about the specific language *being used* in that particular context - the accents and slang that create confusion.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Umi autobús ohóva peteĩ távagui ambuépe sapy’ánte henyhẽ rupi, ojejerure ojejogua hag̃ua bolete peteĩ ára ojeho mboyve."" (The buses travel from one town to another three times a day, and it is necessary to buy a one-day ticket).

* **The best way is to buy a ticket to their destination (Jakar in this case).**  The text implies that tickets are bought *before* boarding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe viajero oho Bumthang-pe ha tekotevẽ osẽ 7 aravo jave** (The traveler goes to Bumthang and waits until 7 o'clock). This isn't a method of stopping at the station.
* **C: Pe viajero oho Paro gotyo ha tekotevẽ osẽ 11 aravo rire** (The traveler goes to Paro and waits until 11 o'clock). This is also not about stopping at the station.
* **D: Pe viajero ohohína este gotyo ha og̃uahẽ estación-pe 6:20 mboyve** (The traveler goes to this town and arrives at the station at 6:20). This describes an arrival time, not a method of stopping.

Mba'épa ha'éta peteĩ consejo iporãva peteĩ turista-pe g̃uarã oviajaséva este gotyo estación de autobuses ohóva ambue távape guive?,"The correct answer is **B: Ojejoguava’erã voíma umi boleto (You can buy tickets)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umi autobús ohóva peteĩ távagui ambuépe sapy’ánte henyhẽ rupi, ojejerure ojejogua hag̃ua bolete peteĩ ára ojeho mboyve."" This translates to ""Buses traveling from one town to another usually allow you to buy a ticket for the next day of travel.""

Therefore, option B is the most relevant and helpful advice for a tourist.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi ómnibus osẽ 8:30 rirénte (Buses depart at 8:30 AM)** - The text mentions departures at 06:30 and 07:30, not 8:30.
* **C: Hetaiterei autobús osẽjepi ára pukukue javeve (More buses depart the next day)** - While true, the text emphasizes the ability to buy tickets for the next day.  This isn't as directly helpful as knowing tickets are available.
* **D: Peteĩ taxi oñondive ojeiporúva ikatu ha’e ñemongu’eha omachavéva (A taxi that is hired is usually a negotiated price)** - The text mentions taxis for specific routes (Paro and Punakha) and doesn't give advice on taxi fares in general.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui nomombe’úi hekopete Tombuctú rehegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Oguereko hetave influencia árabe tetã ambuégui (Has a lot of Arab influence from other countries)**.

Here's why:

The text mentions:  ""...Ary 1990 ramo, oñemoinge sitios del patrimonio mundial oĩva en peligro apytépe, yvyku’i heta rupi. Kóva kuri peteĩva umi ojepytaveha Wonders of the African World de Henry Louis Gates, PBS-pe. Ko táva tuichaiterei iñambue ambue táva ko tetãmegua ndive, hese ojekuaave rupi Arabia reko África-gua rãngue.""

This translates to: ""...In 1990, it was included among the world heritage sites in danger, due to erosion. This is one of the sites presented in Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS. This program highlights other places in this country, showing the Arab and African influence.""

The text explicitly states that the program highlights the Arab and African influence on the country, and Tombuctú is presented as an example. Therefore, Tombuctú has a lot of Arab influence.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: imboriahu (is boring):** The text says it's a tourist attraction with an airport, implying the opposite of boring.
*   **C: Ndojeikekuaái aviõme (is not mentioned):** The text *does* mention Tombuctú.
*   **D: Ohecharamo gueteri umi turista omba’ekuaáseva (is not visited by many tourists):** The text says it's a tourist attraction, implying it *is* visited by tourists.



"
Mavaitéva marandu Tombuctú reheguápa ha’e añetegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe távape ojeikekuaa aviõ rupive (The city is depicted as being inhabited by the wind).**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hasy nunga ojeikeike hag̃ua ipyke ári, """"Tombuctú"""" oñemoha’ãnga peteĩ metáfora de tierras exóticas ha imombyrývaramo. Ko’ágã rupi g̃uarã, Tombuctú hína peteĩ táva oñemomboriahúva, jepéramo hembiasakue rupive oiko chugui peteĩ atracción turística ha oguereko peteĩ aeropuerto.""  This translates to: ""From time to time, ""Tombuctú"" is presented as a metaphor for exotic and intriguing lands. In reality, Tombuctú is a city inhabited by the wind, which has created a tourist attraction and has an airport.""

Option A directly reflects this statement about being ""inhabited by the wind."" The other options are incorrect because the text says Tombuctú *does* have a tourist attraction and an airport. It's also not specifically described as having an African style, and the text explicitly states it *does* attract tourists.



"
Arakaʼépa oñeprograma ypy aʼekue umi Olimpiada arahakupegua? ,"The correct answer is **A: Jasypoapy ary 2021-pe (September 2021)**.

The text states: ""Paraolímpico oikótva 24 jasyapy guive 5 jasyporundy peve 2021-pe."" which translates to ""The Paralympics were held from September 24th to October 5th, 2021.""
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’e árape peteĩ embudo-gui oiko peteĩ tornado?","The correct answer is **C: Oguejy aja umi arai yvytuguasuguiguáva (When winds that are opposite each other collide)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that a tornado forms when there's a column of air with low pressure, and wind speeds are high (100-200 mph) at both the top and bottom.
* The key to this situation is **opposing wind directions**.  When winds moving in opposite directions collide, they can create a rotating column of air. This rotating column can then descend from a thunderstorm, eventually touching down on the ground as a tornado.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yvytu ohupyty jave 100 milla rupi peteĩ aravópe (When winds reach 100 miles per hour in a single storm):** While strong winds are a *component*, it's not the *cause* of the tornado formation itself.
* **B: Umi columna de aire oñepyrũvo ojere (When air columns begin to rise):**  Rising air columns are part of thunderstorm formation, but not the tornado-specific mechanism.
* **D: Opoko rire yvýre (After touching down on the ground):** This describes the tornado *after* it's already formed, not how it starts.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui peteĩ omombe’u hekopete mba’éichapa pe tornado?,"The best answer is **A: Akóinte omoheñói yvytu 100-200 millas rupi peteĩ aravópe.**

Here's why:

* **Option A** directly addresses a key characteristic of a tornado - its extremely high wind speeds (100-200 mph). The passage explicitly states this.
* **Option B** mentions objects being lifted, which is *a consequence* of the tornado, but not a defining characteristic of *how* a tornado is described.
* **Option C** describes the formation process, but the question asks how a tornado is *described*.
* **Option D** is a general description of a tornado but doesn't pinpoint a single, key aspect of how it's characterized.

Therefore, **Option A** most accurately captures a central feature used to describe tornadoes.
"
"Péicha he'i pe pehẽnguépe, moõguipa peteĩ viajero omono’õva’erã consejo pe táva ohotaha política situación rehegua?","The correct answer is **B: Umi temiandu opresentáva pe marandu viaje reheguáva ryepýpe (Travel advisories from news outlets)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Temiandu oñeme'ẽva py'ỹinte hova árinte ojeikuaa, jepivéva ha mbykyeterei ñambohováiramo umi marandu oĩva ojehecha haguãicha ambue tendápe.""  This translates to: ""News outlets, in their duty, inform, warn, and help us to understand the information that exists, as if it were being viewed in other countries."" This highlights the role of news sources in providing information about political situations affecting travel.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Pe tetã ohotaha gobierno guive (The government of the affected country):** While government advisories are important, the passage doesn't emphasize them as the primary source of information. It focuses on understanding the situation from an external perspective.
* **C: Umi tetãygua oikóva pe tetã ojehotahápe (Countries that have relations with the affected country):** While these countries might offer advice, it's not the main point the passage makes.
* **D: Igobierno-guivoi (The government itself):** This is too broad. The passage emphasizes the role of *news outlets* and *travel advisories* as a way to understand the situation.



Therefore, option **B** is the most accurate reflection of the information presented in the passage."
"Oĩramo peteĩ mba’e jesarekorã ojeviaja hag̃ua, mba'épa ndaha'éi katuete ikatúva ohasa peteĩ pytagua?","The correct answer is **B: Marandu mbyky hesakãporãva ha oñe'ẽva política situación tetãmegua rehe (Clear and informative news about the political situation in the country).**

Here's why:

The text states that news about the political situation in a country is crucial for making informed travel decisions. It highlights how news from reliable sources can help assess potential risks. Option B directly reflects this, emphasizing the *clarity* and *informativeness* of the news.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seguro viaje jeheja rehegua ikatu ojepoko (Your travel insurance will cover it).** While travel insurance is important, it doesn't guarantee you can pass through a country. Insurance covers *losses*, not necessarily *passage*.
*   **C: Seguro tesãi rehegua ikatu ojepoko (Your safety insurance will cover it).** This is too general. The text focuses on the *political* situation, not just general safety.
*   **D: Marandu hesakãporãva oñe'ẽva situación política tetãmegua rehe (Informative news about the political situation in the country).** This is very similar to B, but ""hesakãporãva"" (informative) is less strong than ""mbyky"" (clear and informative).

Here's why:

* **The question asks what kind of trip is best to have a travel agent help book.** The passage emphasizes that travel agents are good for trips involving multiple people with specific budgets.
* **Option B directly aligns with this:** ""A trip with two or more people within a specific budget.""
* **The other options are less directly related:**
    * **A:** While a travel agent *could* help with this, the passage doesn't highlight conferences.
    * **C:** Language trips *could* be booked with an agent, but the passage isn't focused on language-specific travel.
    * **D:**  A first trip abroad *could* benefit from an agent, but the passage is more about group trips and budget control.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.
"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’e kásopepa oñebeneficiavéta peteĩ viajero oipytyvõramo chupe peteĩ viaje agente?","The correct answer is **A: Pe viajero orreserva jave vuelo jeho ha jejukuévo g̃uarã ovisita hag̃ua itavaguasu (The traveler reserves their flight and is able to visit the capital city.)**

Here's why:

The text describes travel agencies as helpful for organizing trips, especially for travelers who want to visit different cultures, languages, and countries.  Option A directly reflects this: a travel agent can handle the complex task of booking flights and coordinating a visit to a capital city, making the trip easier for the traveler.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Pe viajero orreservase ñepyrũ jave peteĩ excursión especial (The traveler initially reserves a special excursion)** While agencies *can* arrange excursions, the text emphasizes their ability to plan *entire* trips, not just single excursions.
* **C: Pe viajero oñe’ẽporãrõ ñe’ẽ ojeiporúva ohotahápe (The traveler speaks the language of the country)**  Language skills are helpful, but a travel agent doesn't directly provide or guarantee those skills.  They assist with the logistical planning.
* **D: Pe viajero ovisita jave peteĩ tenda oikuaahápe oĩha hetaichagua cultura ha’e oikuaáva (The traveler visits a shop that has a lot of the culture they want to know.)** This is a very specific and limited scenario.  A travel agent can provide a broader cultural experience through organized itineraries and connections.



"
"Pe pehẽnguépe heʼiháicha, mbaʼépa ikatu oipytyvõ peteĩ oviajavape ani hag̃ua ipochy ovisita jave umi tenda pyahu?","The best answer is **A: Oha’ãrõva’erã umi mba’e tojogua umi mba’e oĩva ha’e ouhágui (Being aware of what exists and what is around you)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what helps avoid problems when visiting hotels. The original text lists many potential issues (manners, language, traffic, accommodation, etc.).  Being aware of these potential issues – anticipating what might arise and being prepared – is the core of preventing problems.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **B: Pe voluntad oñeha’ã hag̃ua ho’u umi tembi’u ndoikuaáiva (The will to learn unknown customs)** - While important, simply *wanting* to learn isn't enough. You need to actively *be aware* of what those customs are and how they affect your behavior.
* **C: Ojepytasóvo umi léi ojoajúva moõguipa ou rehe (If you consult the laws that govern how to behave)** -  While laws are important, they are only one aspect of hotel etiquette and respectful behavior.  Focusing solely on laws is too narrow.
* **D: Ani oporandueterei pe alojamiento rehe oho mboyve (Not avoiding traveling with accommodation)** - This is completely contradictory. Traveling *with* accommodation is the very thing the question is asking about – how to avoid problems *when* you're visiting hotels.



Therefore, **A** is the most comprehensive and directly addresses the question of avoiding problems when visiting hotels, aligning perfectly with the text's emphasis on being prepared and aware.
"
"Oñemopyendáva umi marandu oĩva pe pehẽnguépe rehe, mbaʼeichagua tapichápa ikatu ipochy oho jave ambue tendápe?","The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ tapicha oguerohorýva umi tembi’u iñambuetereíva (A person who is accustomed to social etiquette).**

Here's why:

The question asks who needs to learn about proper behavior when traveling to a new place. The original text lists many aspects of etiquette (modales, leikuéra, tembi'u) as things to consider.  Someone familiar with social etiquette (having learned proper manners) would be the most prepared to navigate these situations.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Peteĩ tapicha oñemotenondéva iñambue rupive (A person who is overly concerned with manners):** While manners are important, being *overly* concerned could be awkward and not necessarily reflect a deeper understanding of cultural norms.
* **C: Peteĩ tapicha iñapytu’ũ ñembotýva (A person who is easily frightened):**  Fear isn't directly related to etiquette or navigating a new place.
* **D: Peteĩ tapicha ovy’áva oñemoarandu jave (A person who is unwilling to learn):**  The text emphasizes the *need* to learn about these things, so someone unwilling to learn wouldn't fit the description.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes cultural adjustments:** The text describes a lack of familiar things like comfortable beds and proper hygiene standards in some establishments.
* **Option A directly addresses the potential discomfort and health risks:**  Being aware of what's on the ground relates to hygiene and avoiding potential health issues, which is a crucial adjustment when traveling to a new country.
* **Why the other options are less suitable:**
    * **B: Ani rehundiparei nde viru tembi’úre umi ára iñepyrũmbýpe** (Don't immerse yourself in your worries on the first few days): While managing stress is important, it doesn't directly address the practical cultural adjustments described.
    * **C: Oje’e iporãha peteĩ tupa’i térã kyha oñeacampa-ramo** (It's good to bring a medicine or plaster): Bringing medication is generally a good idea, but the passage focuses on *cultural* differences in comfort and hygiene, not just potential health emergencies.
    * **D: Epaga peteĩ hotel iporãva rehe pe reguahẽ ypy guive** (Book a nice hotel in advance): Booking a hotel is practical, but the passage highlights issues even in decent establishments, suggesting it's not enough to simply book a nice one.



Therefore, being aware of things on the ground is the most relevant advice based on the passage's core message about cultural adaptation and potential discomfort in a new environment.

Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndoje’éi ha’eha peteĩ mba’e ojedespilfarrava’erãha ojejepokuaaramóme peteĩ tetã ojeguerojerávape?,"The correct answer is **A: Tembi’u occidente estilo (Western-style lodging)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the difficulties travelers face when trying to find accommodation that caters to their needs when traveling in a new country. Specifically, it mentions the lack of comfortable beds (mattresses and platforms) and the presence of insects like ants and scorpions. It also highlights the preference for Western-style hotels for comfort and familiarity.

While the other options are factors in travel comfort, the passage *directly* focuses on the challenges of finding suitable *lodging* that aligns with a Western standard. The passage indicates travelers are forced to camp or make do with uncomfortable sleeping arrangements because Western-style hotels aren't readily available or comfortable.

Here's why:

The question asks about creating a *virtual copy* of the policy *without internet access*.  Option C describes saving a copy to a computer's memory (like a USB drive or internal storage). This is a valid solution when internet access is unavailable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ome’ẽvo peteĩ copia peteĩ iñirũ de viaje-pe (Receiving a copy at the beginning of the trip):** This refers to receiving a physical or digital copy *before* the trip, not creating a copy *during* the trip when internet isn't available.
*   **B: Omondo correo electrónico rupive ijupe peteĩ copia (Getting a copy via email):** This requires internet access to *receive* the email and download the attachment.
*   **D: Oñongatúvo peteĩ copia “arai”-pe (Saving a copy to a ""flash drive""):** This is similar to option C, but less specific. While a flash drive is a valid storage medium, option C more accurately describes the action of saving a copy to the computer's memory, which is a central point for accessing files.

Here's why:

* The question asks what prevents you from having your policy sent to you. The text says you can request a copy via email or international mail.
* Option A states ""Umi pumbyry papapy internacional ojejapo hag̃ua mba’ejerure"" which translates to ""When international mail is processed"". This is the most logical reason why you might not receive your policy.  There could be delays or issues during international mail processing.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Pe aseguradora correo electrónico (The insurance company's email):**  The text explicitly states they can send it via email.
* **C: Umi pumbyry papapy internacional umi ñemoñeĩrã (International mail shipments):** This is too specific.  It doesn't explain *why* there might be a problem.
* **D: Pe póliza jára correo electrónico (The policy via email):** The text says they *can* send it via email.

Therefore, Option A is the most accurate answer."

The question states: ""Ambue cámara ta'ãngamýi-peguava oiporu peteĩ formato 6 x 6 cm, he presisamente peteĩ negativo orekóva 56 x 56 mm rehe."" (Another camera format uses a 6 x 6 cm format, specifically with a negative measuring 56 x 56 mm.)

This directly links the 6x6 cm format with a 56x56 mm negative. The other options describe the 35mm format, which is the standard.
"
Mávapa umi ta’ãngamýi formato rehegua apytégui oikuave’ẽ resolución ojoguáva peteĩ DSLR-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ta’ãngamýi formato mediano rehegua (Medium format)**.

Here's why:

* The question states that the 6x6 cm format with a 56x56 mm negative provides a resolution equivalent to four 35mm negatives.  This indicates a higher resolution than 35mm.
* The 35mm format is the standard and is mentioned as the baseline.
* The 6x6 cm format falls into the category of ""medium format"" photography.  Medium format cameras have larger sensors than 35mm cameras, leading to higher resolution.



Therefore, the answer is **B**."

Here's why:

The initial statement talks about using a blog to document a business trip and how they are starting a new website. The question asks what's *most important* to do when starting a business trip *with* a website.  Standardizing the web format is foundational. You need a solid web presence *before* you start blogging about the trip.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ehai heta artículo peteĩ blog de viajes herakuã porãvape g̃uarã (Publish many articles on a well-designed travel blog):** While blogging is part of the plan, it's a subsequent step. You need a website *first*.
* **C: Emopu’ã nde página web tee (Launch your website):** This is also important, but standardizing the format comes *before* launching. You need to have a clear structure and design.
* **D: Eñembokatupyryve edición-pe (Standardize in editing):** Editing is a process that happens *after* the format is defined.

Therefore, **A** is the most logical and crucial first step.
"
"Oñemoñepyrũvo peteĩ viaje jehaipy negocio-pe jeike reheguáva, mávapa umi mba'e eñemoaranduvéva'erã?","The correct answer is **A: Blogs web renda**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q) asks:** What are the things discussed when starting a business trip related to ""jehaipy negocio"" (business trip)?
* **The Initial Statement (P) says:** The person is writing about blogs/websites related to business trips to share their knowledge. They are also learning about the web format and website setup for a new online business.

Therefore, the most direct answer to what's discussed when starting this type of business trip is **blogs web renda** (business trip blogs/websites). It's the core topic being explored and shared.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Formato web (Web format):** While mentioned in the initial statement, it's a *tool* being learned, not the core topic of discussion related to the business trip itself.
* **C: Web ñemoambuépe (Website setup):** Similar to B, this is a *process* being learned, not the central subject matter of the business trip.
* **D: Moñepyrũ web renda (Starting a web business):** This is a broader topic than just the content being shared *about* business trips.  The focus is on sharing insights from a business trip, not necessarily starting a web business in general.



"

This translates to: ""...regarding respiratory infections, they are more common in hot climates, they are very deadly and cause a lot of illness but are not dangerous.""

Therefore, the text explicitly links respiratory infections to hot climates.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, pe exposición regular ikatu ogueru inmunidad mba’épe g̃uarã?","The correct answer is **C: Apañuái pyturape rehegua (Frequent exposure to germs)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks why regular exposure helps build immunity.** The text explicitly states: ""Ógape, ñaime rupi expuesto ko'ã germen-kuéra upepeguápe, ikatuete nde repytáma inmune umi mba'épe."" This translates to ""I understand that being exposed to these germs regularly allows me to become immune to them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Apañuái tyekue rehegua (Allergic reactions):** The text doesn't discuss allergies.
* **B: Umi germen upepegua (The germs themselves):** While germs are involved, the key is the *exposure* to them.
* **D: Delhi rye rehegua (Delhi belly):** Delhi belly is mentioned as an example of a specific illness, not the general concept of building immunity through exposure.

Therefore, the text clearly links **frequent exposure** to the development of immunity."
Mávapa ko’ã mba’e apytégui ome’ẽ ventaja ojeviaja hag̃ua tenda Schengen ryepýpe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndaiporirupi heta visa jejerure (You don't need to get multiple visas)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that with a Schengen visa, you don't need to get a separate visa for each Schengen country. This is a major advantage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hembyve hag̃ua viru (Avoid paying fines)**: The text doesn't mention fines being avoided.
* **C: Noñecontrolaguasúirupi umi pasaporte (Not having passports controlled)**:  The text states that passport control is *reduced* within the Schengen area, not eliminated.
* **D: Ndaipóri mba'eveichagua requisito pasaporte rehegua (No passport requirements)**: Passports are still required to enter the Schengen area.

Therefore, option A accurately reflects a key advantage of the Schengen Area explained in the text.
"
Mbaʼépa ndaikatuvéima ojejuhu Tutankhamón tyvytýpe?,"The correct answer is **C: Pe momia ati’ykue (The mummy's face)**.

The text states: ""opytáta ohechasépe, iñakã ha ijati’ỹ pevénte ikatu rupi ojehecha,"" which translates to ""after being opened, it was taken out, and the face was washed and examined.""  This implies the face was examined, so it *was* visible. The question asks what *couldn't* be found. The text says that the wealth in the tomb was removed and is now in the Egyptian Museum, but it doesn't explicitly state that the mummy's face was missing or couldn't be found. Therefore, it's the most logical answer that the face wasn't something that couldn't be discovered.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jeguakakuéra (The jewels)** - The text says the jewels were removed and are in the museum.
* **B: Pe momia akãngue (The mummy's body)** - The text explicitly mentions the mummy's body was taken out and examined.
* **D: Umi iviru hetáva (The funerary objects)** - The text states the funerary objects were removed and are in the museum.

This translates to: ""Those who are returning home can enjoy a scenic drive along the Sea to Sky Corridor."" The Sea to Sky Corridor is the road that connects Vancouver to Whistler, and it's highlighted as a scenic route for travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ypa'ũ Granville (Granville Island):** While mentioned as a starting point for the water taxi, it's not a route *to* see the mountains.
* **C: Ypa’ũ Bowen (Bowen Island):** Bowen Island is the destination of the trip, not a route to see the mountains.
* **D: Whistler:** Whistler is a mountain resort, but the question asks about routes *to see* the mountains, not the destination itself. The Sea to Sky Corridor *leads to* Whistler.

The text explicitly states: ""Katu avei, y heta rupi ndaikatumo’ãi ehecha hekoitépe mba’éichapa añetete umi catarata, y hetaiterei rupi!"" which translates to ""Also, many times you can't see how the waterfalls are, and many times!"" This indicates that seeing the waterfalls from a unique perspective is a key reason to visit during the rainy season.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sa’ive turista-kuéra:** While tourists visit, the text doesn't say the number of tourists is the reason for the rainy season's appeal.
* **C: Rehecha porãvéta Cataratas:** The text says you *can't* always see the waterfalls clearly during the rainy season, making this incorrect.
* **D: Ani eho ára oky hetaveha jave:** The text says the rainy season *is* a time of heavy rain.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼãva apytégui noñerrecomendái ojeiporu jave peteĩ dron oñefilma hag̃ua?","The best answer is **C: Oinvestigávo umi permiso (Investigating the permits)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Dron ñemboveve peteĩ aeropuerto ykérehe térã yvypóra aty ári na’ipórãi ojejapo, ni ndaha’éiramo ilegal eimehápe."" This translates to: ""Drones cannot be flown near an airport or a crowd, nor are they allowed in illegal areas.""

Therefore, the core concern is checking for and obtaining the necessary permits and complying with regulations regarding drone operation, especially in restricted areas.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: Ojejesarekova’erã ojeho mboyve mba'épa ojeheja oñefilma (It's recommended to check what is being filmed):** While checking what you film is generally good practice for ethical reasons, it's not the primary legal concern raised in the text.
* **B: Ojehupyty hag̃ua licencia adicional (Obtain an additional license):** The text doesn't mention a general ""additional license"" requirement. Specific permits are mentioned.
* **D: Oñefilmávo umi área henyhẽvape añoite ndojehechakuaamo'ãihápe upe dron (Filming in areas you don't know):**  The text isn't about filming in *unknown* areas; it's about restricted areas like airports and crowds.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, moõpa oĩ umi tendaiporãvéva oñefilma hag̃ua ojeiporúvo peteĩ dron?","The correct answer is **D: Umi tenda oñeme’ẽmahaguépe ndéve permiso**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the regulations for filming with a drone near establishments. The provided text states that flying a drone near airports or crowds is prohibited and illegal.  Option D, ""Umi tenda oñeme’ẽmahaguépe ndéve permiso"" (Establishments provide you with permission), implies that permission is required to fly a drone near establishments.  This is the most logical and accurate answer based on the information given.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ava’aty ypýpe reikuaarõ ndaipochymo’ãiha hikuái reiporuhaguére ijykére dron** (You should be aware of the airspace to avoid flying near aircraft) - While airspace awareness is important, this doesn't directly address filming near establishments.
* **B: Umi tenda ndojehejaihápe oñeguenohẽ fotografía** (Photography is not allowed in establishments) - This is irrelevant to drone filming.
* **C: Umi tenda oñeime hetahápe sa'ive ojehechatahápe dron** (Establishments have a sign prohibiting drone filming) -  While signs might exist, the primary concern isn't just signs but the need for permission.



Therefore, **D** is the best answer.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'e ñe’ẽasãi oñe'ẽva pe requisito de registro proceso de visa rehe ndaha'éi añeteguáva?","The correct answer is **C: Ikatu tekotevẽ ojevisita umi oficina de inmigración**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what *isn't* a requirement for the visa registration process, according to the text.
* The text explicitly states: ""Kóva ikatu oikotevẽ oñemyanyhẽ peteĩ formulario policía upepegua ndive térã peteĩ visita inmigración oficina-kuérape."" (You can either submit a police form or visit an immigration office.)
* Option C directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiméramo repyta umi alojamiento turístico-pe, ikatu natekotevẽi reñemboheraguapy:** (It's possible to extend your stay in tourist accommodation, but it's not mentioned that you need to register.)  The text *does* mention registration for tourist accommodations.
* **B: Mayma tetã ojerure oñeñemboheraguapy hag̃ua moakãharakuéra upepegua ndive:** (In many countries, you need to register your accommodation details.) This is true, but the text isn't saying it's *not* a requirement.
* **D: Oĩ tenda umi hotel-pe ikatuha omaneja pe ñemboheraguapy:** (There are desks in hotels that handle registration.) While hotels might facilitate the process, the text doesn't say registration *must* happen at the hotel.

Therefore, the only option that accurately states something *not* mentioned as a requirement is C.

Here's why:

The text states that if a tourist is staying at a tourist accommodation, they *must* register. It also says that this registration can be done at a police station or an immigration office. Therefore, immigration offices are a place where the registration can occur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peteĩ tahachirenda upe tendapegua (A separate room in the hotel):** The text mentions registration, but not necessarily in a separate room. It's referring to a process, not a physical space.
*   **B: Pe tenda ojepytahápe (At the hotel's reception):** While hotels often facilitate the registration process, the text doesn't explicitly state the *only* place it can happen. It mentions police stations and immigration offices as alternatives.
*   **C: Peteĩ oficina de correos local-pe (At a local post office):** There is no mention of post offices in the text.

Mávapepa noipytyvõmo’ãi ombaʼapórõ voluntario-ramo oviaja aja?,"The correct answer is **D: Peteĩ tapicha ikatúva ointeresa chupe oiko hag̃ua ha hi'upyrã.**

Here's why:

The text describes a volunteer who travels to help people in need. The key points are:

* **They are open to new experiences and different cultures.**
* **They are knowledgeable and skilled in helping others.**
* **They are willing to learn from the people they are helping.**
* **They are adaptable and can work independently or as part of a team.**

Option D (""Peteĩ tapicha ikatúva ointeresa chupe oiko hag̃ua ha hi'upyrã"" - Someone who is interested in what they do and is well-prepared) best reflects these qualities. The text emphasizes the volunteer's enthusiasm and readiness to contribute.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Oĩ oha’ãrõva ojuhu angirũ pyahu tetã ambuére (Someone who has initial knowledge of the new country).** While helpful, it's not the *most* important quality described.  The text emphasizes adaptability and learning *while* there.
* **B: Oĩ ohekáva peteĩ jehepyme’ẽ porã (Someone who is well-prepared with information).** Similar to A, preparation is important, but the text emphasizes the volunteer's openness to *new* information and experiences.
* **C: Oĩ oha’ãrõva ohupyty peteĩ katupyry pyahu (Someone who is capable of achieving a significant result).** While a volunteer *can* achieve results, the text emphasizes the *process* – their willingness to learn and help, not necessarily a grand outcome.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...eikuaa yvypóra pyehu, ejeikuaave nde voi, ema’ẽ ambueháicha **ha avei eguereko katupyry pyahu.**"" (It knows the local language, introduces you, offers you accommodation and comfort, and even helps with financial issues).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Haimete akóinte ojehepyme’ẽ** (Sometimes it connects you) - While volunteering might *lead* to connections, it's not the primary way it helps a traveler struggling with resources.
* **B: Uperire ikatu osẽ ambue mba’apo** (Sometimes it offers other things) -  The passage doesn't mention offering ""other things"" besides accommodation and help with financial issues.
* **D: Ikatu nepytyvõ ema’ẽ hag̃ua ambueháicha** (It helps you to communicate in other ways) -  The passage states it knows the *local language* and introduces you, implying communication is facilitated, but doesn't specifically state help with communicating *in other ways*.

Here's why:

The paragraph describes the typical journey of a Disney World visitor:

1.  **Travels to Orlando:** They arrive at Orlando International Airport.
2.  **Travels to a Disney hotel:** They take a bus to a Disney-owned hotel.
3.  **Enjoys Disney property:** They explore and enjoy the Disney parks.

Therefore, the overall experience is *taking a trip to Disney*. Options A, B, and D describe specific parts of that trip, but option C encompasses the entire experience.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Umi boleteo ndaikatúi oñembohsa peteĩ tapichágui ambuépe."" (Tickets cannot be resold to another person).
* **Option A contradicts this statement.** It claims Park-hopper tickets *can* be resold. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oĩ alojamiento upe tendapete ojeguerekóva** (Accommodation is available at the resort). - The passage mentions accommodation, but it's not presented as a problem or something that's *not* part of the ""Disney World experience.""
* **C: Oĩ autobús ojeguerekóva oñembohasa hag̃ua umi viajero-pe aeropuerto guive pe propiedad peve** (There is a bus to transport travelers from the airport to the property). - The passage mentions the bus service, but it's not presented as something problematic.
* **D: Umi jeikerã heta árape g̃uarãva ikatu ojejuhújepi umi web renda subasta aporã** (Multi-day tickets are sold on online auctions). - The passage mentions this practice but states it's *not* allowed and is a problem for Disney.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions: ""internet-pe jeheka """"Ñorairõ renda mbo'epy rehegua"""" ikatu ome'ẽ peteĩ empresa upepegua renda."" This translates to ""On the internet, there is a search for """"Survival skills"""" which offers a certain skill.""

The text then goes on to describe the courses offered under that search, including ""juegos de roles, heta primero auxilio y sapy'ánte entrenamiento mboka jeiporurã. Aranduka ha maranduhaikuéra oñe'ẽva supervivecia desieerto-pe rehe oĩ meme jepi, katu umi ojeikuaaukáva oñe'ẽva ñorairõ renda rehe sa'ive.""  This translates to ""Role-playing games, first aid and emergency training are also offered. There are memes about desert survival knowledge and information, but those who know about survival skills are talking.""

Therefore, option C, ""Ñorãirõrã tenda rehegua ñemobosako’i"" (Survival skills training), is the most accurate answer.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions a course about ""Ñorairõ renda rehegua"" (Survival). The options provided list topics mentioned in the text.  The text highlights that this course includes:

*   ""Aranduka ha maranduhaikuéra oñe'ẽva supervivecia desieerto-pe rehe oĩ meme jepi"" (Information and advice about desert survival)
*   ""Umi ojeikuaaukáva oñe'ẽva ñorairõ renda rehe sa'ive"" (Those who know about survival talk about it).

While First Aid and Role-playing are also part of the courses offered, the main focus and the most directly related to the question about a professional training class is the survival course itself. Therefore, ""Ñorairõrã renda rehegua"" is the most fitting choice."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa pe iporãvéva ani hag̃ua oje’u y potencialmente contaminado?","The correct answer is **C: Oñembopupu y peteĩ aravo’i aja (The water is collected once)**.

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** ""Ambue tendápe, y ñembopupu peteĩ aravo'i aja oikóma, ambuévape oikotevẽ hetave.""  This translates to: ""In other cases, water collected once is found to be contaminated.""

* **The question asks:** ""He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa pe iporãvéva ani hag̃ua oje’u y potencialmente contaminado?"" This translates to: ""As mentioned elsewhere, what is the best way not to say water potentially contaminated?""  It's looking for the *least* risky scenario.

* **Option C** directly addresses the scenario mentioned in the problem where collecting water *once* is associated with contamination. This is the scenario to *avoid*.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Oñembopupu y heta aravo’i pukukue (The water is collected multiple times):**  While collecting water multiple times *might* reduce contamination, the problem doesn't explicitly say this is ideal, and the effectiveness of filtering is questionable.
* **B: Ojejogua y botellapegua (The water is stored in a bottle):** Storing water in a bottle doesn't prevent contamination; it just *might* slow down the growth of bacteria (depending on the bottle material and how clean it is). It's not a guaranteed solution.
* **D: Oñehesa’ỹijo pe y jahecha oĩpa amenaza específica (The water is tested to see if a specific threat exists):** Testing is important for *confirmation*, but doesn't prevent the water from being contaminated in the first place. It's reactive, not preventative.



Therefore, the best answer is **C**. The problem highlights that collecting water just once is a high-risk situation, and avoiding that is what the question is asking."
"Pe pehẽnguépe heʼiháicha, mbaʼépa ha’etévaicha ndaikatúiva umi oytáva ikatupyrývape jepe?","The correct answer is **B: Ojeyta y hypývape (They can escape through the riverbed)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where a river floods and carries people away. It mentions that the flow of the river can be divided into sections. The passage then states that if a person is swept away, they can try to escape **within the riverbed** (y hypyvape) to avoid being carried further downstream.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojeyta ag̃uĩeterei umi arrecife-gui (They can escape from the reefs):** While reefs might be present, the text doesn't explicitly say escaping *from* the reefs is a viable escape method. The focus is on escaping the current within the river.
* **C: Ojeyta ysyry rovái (They can escape to another river):**  The text describes a single river flooding. There's no indication of another river being accessible as an escape route.
* **D: Ojeyta umi ola jerére (They can escape above the waves):** This is incorrect because the person is already being carried by the waves. Escaping *above* the waves is not a realistic option in this scenario.

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where a person is caught in a river current. The best course of action is to tie a rope around your waist to help you stay afloat and potentially be rescued. The text explicitly states, ""Eñeha'ã ejapi peteĩ tenda ndejapy'ỹ jeýta gotyo térã nde katupyrykue ome'ẽramo nderecháramo, ikatu reha'ãrõ peteĩ rescate."" (You should tie a rope around your waist or use your belt if possible, so you can be rescued.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eyta pya’eve pe ysyry rovái** (Wait for the river to calm down): This is a risky strategy. The current might not calm down, and waiting could make the situation worse.
* **C: Eyta ambue gotyo** (Go to another side):  This isn't always possible or safe. The current might be strong on the other side too.
* **D: Eyta pe y guýpe** (Swim against the current):  The text mentions that swimming against the current is futile and exhausting.

Here's why:

* The initial text mentions castles in the **Valle del Loira, Valle del Rin, and along the Danube River**.
* The question asks about a worthwhile castle visit for a ""jepytu’u"" (tourism) excursion.
* Option C, ""Valle del Rin-pe"" (in the Rhine Valley), is a direct and valid option mentioned in the text as a location for castle visits, making it a suitable choice for tourism.
* Options A and B refer to specific locations (Danube River and Canal Erie) that are mentioned but not explicitly linked to castles in the introductory text.
* Option D is a general description of a type of tour, not a specific location.



Therefore, the most logical answer based on the provided text is **C**."

The other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage explicitly states that marital status is *not* discussed.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention anything being hidden.
* **D:** The passage doesn't say that people are never strengthened.

Here's why:

* The question asks how the women near the Atlantic Ocean are helped *after* the damage.
* The text states that they are given a large initial sum to repair the damage.
* Options A, C, and D describe actions women *avoid* doing, not actions they *receive* to help them.

Therefore, option B is the only one that aligns with the information provided in the text."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’e kásopepa peteĩ mymba ka’aguy rehegua fotógrafo oikotevẽ peteĩ teleobjetivo?","The correct answer is **A: Oñeguenohérõ ta'ãnga umi mymba michĩvape (To photograph small objects)**.

Here's why:

The text states that photographers use telephoto lenses to photograph groups of animals or objects that are far away. It also mentions that exotic animals are often found in parks and can be photographed from a distance.  The key phrase is ""oñeguenohérõ ta'ãnga umi mymba michĩvape"" which directly translates to ""to photograph small objects"".  This aligns perfectly with the context of using a telephoto lens for distant subjects, which often *are* small.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Umi ta'ãnga ojeiporúramo oñeikuaave’ẽ hag̃ua (To showcase the beauty of objects):** While showcasing beauty is a goal of photography, the text doesn't specifically tie telephoto lenses to showcasing beauty.
* **C: Umi mymba oñeguenohẽva ta’ãngápe otĩramo (When the photographed animals are in a group):**  Photographing groups is *a* reason to use telephoto, but not the *primary* or encompassing reason, according to the text.
* **D: Peteĩ parque oguerekórõ mbojojaha oñeguenohẽ haguã ta'ãnga ojehepyme'ẽ haguá (When a park has a location to photograph a combined object):** This is too specific and doesn't reflect the general use of telephoto lenses for distant subjects.

Here's why:

The passage highlights the challenges of photographing wildlife:

*   **Difficult subjects:** Animals are unpredictable and hard to capture.
*   **Technical requirements:**  Requires specialized equipment (telephoto lenses, etc.) and skill.
*   **Hostile environments:** The environments themselves (forests, jungles) can be dangerous.

Option D directly addresses the environmental challenges, which are a core element of the difficult task described in the passage. The other options are less central to the overall challenges outlined.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tapekuéra helada ha nevada oĩhápe, fricción sa'ive ha ndaikatúi oñemboguata reimeramoguáicha peteĩ asfaltado perõme."" (When roads are icy and snowy, slippery friction and inability to steer like normal are present on an asphalt road.)

The passage highlights that the ice and snow create a lack of friction, making it difficult to control a vehicle. While the other options are related, slippery friction is the most direct and accurate explanation for why it's difficult to drive on icy or snowy roads.
"
Mba'épa oiméne opyta peteĩcha renta rehegua impuesto opáichagua tetã rupi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ñemohendapy (Taxation)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* income tax differs between countries.** The passage establishes that income tax is a fundamental part of government revenue collection, and that rates and brackets vary. This variation *is* taxation in action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hepykue (Randomness):** Tax systems are not random; they are structured and designed by governments.
* **C: Moõpa oñemog̃uahẽ (How it's combined):** While the passage mentions combined levels (federal and local), the core reason for differences isn't just the combination itself.
* **D: Mopyendaha (Disagreement):** Disagreement might exist about tax policies, but it's not the fundamental reason for *how* income tax is applied differently across countries.

Therefore, the best and most direct answer reflecting the reason for income tax differences is taxation itself."

Here's why:

The question asks where your income tax should be paid if you work in another country. The passage states that income tax is generally paid in the country where the income is earned.  Option C directly reflects this principle.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiméramo rembaʼapohína tetã ambuépe ha katu reñemopyenda ambue hendápe (It is possible to work in another country and then send money to another country):** This is too general. While you *might* send money home, it doesn't address where the tax is actually paid.
* **B: Estados Unidos-pe (In the United States):**  This is incorrect because the question asks about working *in another country*.
* **D: Oimeháme umi tarifa sa’ivehápe (Depending on the tax rates):** Tax rates are a factor, but they don't determine *where* the tax is paid.

* **Option B** focuses on botanical aspects, which is only *one* aspect of what's showcased.
* **Option C** talks about the size of exhibits, which isn't the *primary* reason for a world fair.
* **Option D** is incorrect as the text says countries *do* participate.

* **Option A directly reflects this:** ""Umi jehechauka ohechaukava’erã peteĩ tetã rembiasakue ha umi mba’e oikóva ko yvy ape ári."" (The exhibits present a country's customs and things found on this earth.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndaikatúi pe aty ojejapo opa ary peteĩ tetãme año** (The association is not held every year in the same country) - The text says it *is* held annually, but not necessarily in the same country.  This isn't directly stated as a rule.
* **C: Umi jeguerovyá guasu ikatu ipuku poteĩ jasy peve** (The large gardens are only one month long) - The text says the large gardens are *50 hectares* and takes a significant amount of time to prepare, suggesting a longer duration.
* **D: Pe feria ojejapo hag̃ua opavave tetã oparticipava’erã** (The fair is held in turn by the participating countries) - While countries likely take turns hosting, this isn't a directly stated rule.


Therefore, **A** is the best and most accurate answer based on the provided text.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the reason for the warnings and precautions is to prevent people from disturbing the forest (teko ka’aguy).  It mentions that people are getting injured from being charged by animals. The core issue is the disruption of the natural environment and the animals' behaviors due to human presence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hyakuã mbaretéva (Being too loud):** While noise *can* disturb animals, the text focuses on the overall *disruption* of the forest, not just loudness.
* **B: Noñeñemombyrýi (Being charged):** Being charged is a *consequence* of disrupting the forest, not the root cause.
* **D: Heta mymba ndojepokuaái ohecha yvypóra (Many animals aren't used to seeing people):** This is partially true, but the text emphasizes the broader impact of human presence on the forest ecosystem.



Therefore, disrupting the forest is the most accurate and comprehensive answer to why these warnings are in place.
