"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tɛ jate ladilikan ɲuman ye walasa ka akɔridiyɔn fɔ?","The correct answer is **D: Dɔ fara i ka nɛgɛniw digi cogo teliya kan walasa ka farankan mankan sɔrɔ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Akɔridiyɔn kan, walasa ka mankan layɛlɛ, i bɛ nɛgɛniw digi ni fanga ni teliya dɔɔnin ye."" (The accordion, the player's hands, were moving rapidly with the frets and keys.)
* **Option D directly reflects this:** ""Dɔ fara i ka nɛgɛniw digi cogo teliya kan walasa ka farankan mankan sɔrɔ"" (The player's hands were rapidly moving with the frets and keys, and the player was playing the accordion).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Walasa ka mankan layɛlɛ, i bɛ butɔnw digu ni fanga min ye, dɔ fara o kan** (The player's hands were moving rapidly with the frets and keys, and the player was playing the music). - While related, it doesn't specifically mention the accordion.
* **B: Lamagali nafatanw dɔgɔya kosɛbɛ walasa i ka mɛn ka sɔrɔ i ma sɛgɛn** (The elderly person was using the player's hands to play the music). - The passage indicates the player was using their *own* hands.
* **C: I hakili to a la ka fɔlikanw digi ka i bolo to lafiya kɔnɔ** (The player was moving their fingers on the keys, and it was a peaceful sight). -  The passage emphasizes the *rapid* movement of the fingers, not just peacefulness.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and directly supported answer."
"N'i bɛ ka akɔridiyɔn fɔ, ninnu jumɛn de b’i dɛmɛ ka dɔfara mankan kan?","The correct answer is **B: Fanga caman**.

Here's why:

The text states that when someone plays the accordion, they use ""fanga caman"" (fender button) and ""teliya dɔɔnin"" (thumb button).  The question asks what part of the accordion is used with a ""fanga caman"".  Therefore, the answer is ""fanga caman.""
"
Munna jabarani jaw kunw tigɛlendo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka dugumasɛbɛnniw yamaruya**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Where is the source of the problem?""  The provided text explains *what* overscan is (a problem with DVDs causing black borders) and *how* it happens (due to the video processing).  It then asks where the *source* of this problem is.

Option A, ""Ka dugumasɛbɛnniw yamaruya"" translates to ""It comes from the DVD player."" This aligns with the text's explanation that the overscan issue originates with the DVD player's video processing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Walasa ja ka ekaran bɛɛ lafa:** ""It comes from the television's settings."" This is the opposite of what the text states.
* **C: Ka yɛlɛmali nɔgɔmanw yɛlɛmali yamaruya fɔrima wɛrɛw la:** This option is grammatically incorrect and doesn't have a clear meaning related to the text.
* **D: Ka dugumasɛbɛnni tigɛ ka surunya dugumana na kosɛbɛ:** ""It comes from the sound system connected to the DVD player.""  While the sound system is connected, the *problem* is with the video processing of the DVD player itself.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ bɛ se ka nin degun jumɛn kelen de sɔrɔ n'a bɛ ka filimu dɔ yɛlɛma ka ta DVD fɔrima la?","The correct answer is **C: Ja dɔ min bɛ ekaran bɛɛ lafa**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""If the image is distorted, why does the DVD look like it has a black border around it?""
* **The provided text explains:** Overscan is a phenomenon where the TV crops the edges of the image. This results in a black border (like a frame) around the picture.
* **Option C** translates to ""Yes, it's because of the overscan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ja dɔ min tɛ ekaran bɛɛ lafa** translates to ""Yes, it's because of the picture quality."" While picture quality *can* cause issues, the text specifically identifies overscan as the cause of the black border.
* **B: Dugumasɛbɛnniw fan dɔ tigɛ** translates to ""The player is broken.""  While a faulty player *could* cause problems, the text focuses on the TV's cropping behavior, which is overscan.
* **D: Ka kunw tigɛ** translates to ""It's because of the contrast."" Contrast issues don't directly cause a black border.



"
Bretaɲi kɛlɛbolo dɔ tun bɛ min?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The passage states: ""Cadwalder kun bena kɛlɛkɛbolo dɔ ci Biritaniki kɛlɛkɛbolo marayɔrɔ ka`a Bordertown kɔnɔ..."" which translates to ""Cadwalder was a British colonial major of Bordertown...""

Therefore, Bordentown is the correct answer. The other options are mentioned in the passage but not as the location of the British colonial major.
"
Jɔn de tigɛnɔ yera tigɛra sɛbɛni kan?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The passage states: ""...tigɛra sɛbɛni tigɛnon bila mina Wasadenbulɔn ɲɛmɔgɔ fɛ John Hancock ani Sɛkiretɛri Charles Thomson cira ka ta so damani damani dɔrɔn John Dunlap gafedilanyɔrɔ."" This directly indicates that John Dunlap printed the broadsides.
"
"Nin yɔrɔ kofɔtɔ ninnu na, Dunlap broadside dɔ sera laban jumɛn na?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The text states: ""Sɛbɛn fotokopi de sera Londres Utikalo tile 10."" which translates to ""Seven copies were sent to London on the 10th.""
"
Kolonɛli Stark ka kɛlɛkulu tun bɛ min?,"The correct answer is **D: Sinsan ɲɛfɛ** (A very tall man).

The text states: ""Gidley walima Start kun ye poto jɔ piye 100 bɔɲɔgɔngo (mɛtiri 30) sinsan nɛfɛ ani ye ɔridiri di ko mɔgɔsi kana mugu ci fo waatimina nin u yɛrɛw ka kɛlɛkɛdenw tɛmɛna la."" This translates to: ""Colonel Stark was about 100 feet (30 meters) tall and was originally a man of great stature and was known for his ability to command troops.""

""Sinsan ɲɛfɛ"" accurately reflects his exceptional height.
"
"K'a kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Stark ka mɔgɔw y'u ka sinsan bonya tuma jumɛn?","The correct answer is **C: Ji funnu fitiniw waati la (The time of the Mystic River disaster)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nin ji funu fitini ye wo dayɛlɛ Mystic Riŋer fanfɛ penɛnsili kɔkɔdugu ni kɔrɔn yanfan fɛ, u ye sinsan bɔɲan jɔna nin kabkuru kɔgɔ surumaniye kɔkɔ yanfan dan fɔ ji dagolola jida fitini sanfɛ."" This translates to: ""At the time of the Mystic River disaster, a large number of people were lost and many houses were destroyed, forcing them to flee the disaster.""

The question asks *why* the people fled. The passage directly links their flight to the Mystic River disaster.  The other options are incorrect based on the information provided.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de tun ye Sini nin juguya waati ba ye?","The correct answer is **C: Han Fangabolo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""O waatiw la lakodɔnniba tun ye MasamaraSaba ka waati ye min ye san 60 kɛ Han ni Jin Fangabolo ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ."" This translates to ""The most important dynasties are the Masamara Saba dynasty and the Han and Jin dynasties, which are considered major dynasties.""
* **The question asks:** ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de tun ye Sini nin juguya waati ba ye?"" which means ""Which dynasty is considered the most important in Chinese history?""
* **Therefore, the most important dynasty mentioned as being significant along with the Masamara Saba is the Han dynasty.**  Jin is also mentioned, but the question asks for *the* most important dynasty, and the passage groups Han and Jin together as major dynasties.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jin Fangabolo:** While the Jin dynasty is mentioned, it isn't presented as *the* most important. It's grouped with the Han.
* **B: Xi'an ka waati:** Xi'an is a city and a former capital, not a dynasty.
* **D: Masamara Sabaw waati:**  The Masamara Saba dynasty is mentioned as *one* of the important dynasties, but not *the* most important in the context of the question.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de ye tiɲɛ ye dugumɛnɛ kulu don tɔ sigiyɔrɔfalen la?","The correct answer is **A: U bɛ don ɲagala sufɛ** (He had been suffering from a fever).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Dugumɛnɛni kulu be tama sufɛ ani be jɔ ka lafiyɛn tile kɔnɔ."" (The old man had a fever and was not well).
* **The question asks:** ""What was the reason for the old man's visit to the doctor?""
* **The text indicates the reason:** The old man went to the doctor *because* he had a fever.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U ka dumuni maralenw dɔgɔyara** (He had a strong headache). - The text mentions a fever, not a headache.
* **C: U bɛ ɲaga da min bɛ falen tile 17 kɔfɛ** (He had been feeling unwell for 17 days). - While he was unwell, the text doesn't specifically state the duration of his illness. The fever is the primary reason given.
* **D: U bɛ tama tilefɛ** (He had a cough). - The text mentions a fever, not a cough.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn de bɛ dugumɛnɛkulu ka ɲagada delinakow ye sigiyɔrɔfalen waati la?","The correct answer is **B: U bɛ tama tile 17 ka sɔrɔ u m'a don ɲaga la**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Nin yɔrɔfalen falen girin girinw walima tamaw be tile tani 17 de kɛ."" This translates to ""And the age of the woman when she gave birth was 17 years old.""
* **The question asks:** ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn de bɛ dugumɛnɛkulu ka ɲagada delinakow ye sigiyɔrɔfalen waati la?"" This translates to ""What was the age of the woman when she gave birth, according to the woman's own words?""

Therefore, the answer is simply that she was 17 years old when she gave birth. Option B directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U bɛ ɲaga dilan sufɛ:** This translates to ""She said she was a very old woman."" This contradicts the text.
* **C: U bɛ ɲaga falen don o don:** This translates to ""She said she was a small child."" This also contradicts the text.
* **D: U bɛ don ɲaga kelenw de la waati jayan kɔnɔ:** This translates to ""She said she had a large family."" This is irrelevant to the question about her age when giving birth."
Fɔta jumɛn de bɛ taa fɛ hali ni kɛnɛma taamasiɲɛw bɛ yen?,"The correct answer is **B: Waatidɔw la yɛlɛmaliw**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the previous sentence is talking about. The previous sentence describes ""waatidɔw la yɛlɛmali"" (the shiny tables) and how they are used with other items like bowls, plates, and glasses.  Therefore, the sentence is about the shiny tables.

* **A: Kɔnɔna yɛlɛmaliw** (the bowls) is mentioned in the sentence but isn't the main subject being discussed.
* **C: Adamadenfarikolo kɔnɔna sumalila** (the glasses) is also mentioned but not the primary focus.
* **D: Yɛlɛma jateminɛnenw** (the table legs) are part of the tables but not what the sentence is principally about.



"
Kumaden jumɛn de bɛ mɔgɔw ɲɛfɔ minnu kɛcoko n’u yɛrɛ jogo tɛ kelen ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Fɛ suguyaw**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes a situation where people are moving from rural areas to urban areas for jobs.** It says people leave their villages (farikolo) to find work in cities (jamana).
* **The question asks what the majority of people are doing.**  The text explicitly states, ""Nin jamana konodenw bɛɛ ye kelen ye lajɛlila nin mɔgɔyadilan na cogoya kɛrɛnkɛrɛn ne dola. Nin fɛnw be yɛlɛmabolo cama jira nin cogoya kɛrɛnkɛrɛni ye, u be wele ko farikolo camaw."" This translates to ""And the people who come to the city are looking for work and earning money. And those who are looking for work in the city come from the villages.""
* **Therefore, the majority are coming *from* the villages to the city.** ""Fɛ suguyaw"" means ""from the villages.""



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Suguya kelen** (Village work): This refers to the work done *in* the villages, not the movement *from* them.
* **B: Nimafɛw** (Rural people): This is just a description of the people, not what they are *doing*.
* **D: Suguya caman** (Village earnings): This refers to the money earned *in* the villages, not the movement *from* them.



"
Ninnu cɛla jumɛn kelen de ye danɲɛ ye min bɛ nimafɛw minnu bɛ sinsin yɔrɔ kɛrɛnkɛrɛnna ?,"The correct answer is **C: Fɛ suguyaw** (The population of the young ones).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a population dynamic:** It talks about the population having young people who are born and grow into adults, then have their own children.  This is a core concept of population growth.
* **The question asks about the key factor determining population growth.**
* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nin jamana konodenw bɛɛ ye kelen ye lajɛlila nin mɔgɔyadilan na cogoya kɛrɛnkɛrɛn ne dola. Nin fɛnw be yɛlɛmabolo cama jira nin cogoya kɛrɛnkɛrɛni ye, u be wele ko farikolo camaw."" This translates to: ""And as the young people grow into adults and have children, the population grows. And as the adults die, the population shrinks.""

Therefore, the growth of the population is directly linked to the **number of young people** (fɛ suguyaw).  They are the ones entering the reproductive phase and contributing to population increase.



Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Suguya kelen (Young people):** While related, this is too broad. It doesn't pinpoint *what* about the young people is most crucial.
* **B: Popilasiyɔn (Population):** This is the overall term, not the *factor* driving change.
* **D: Suguya caman (Adult young people):** This is also too specific. The passage speaks to *all* young people, not just those who are transitioning to adulthood.



"
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ se ka kɛ kunkokanu yɔrɔlajɛli misaliya baara ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Mize Siyansi lajɛli (Science Studies)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Kunkokanu yɔrɔlajɛli as a field of study dealing with the relationship between humans and nature, encompassing topics like ecology, conservation, and the history of human interaction with the environment.  This aligns directly with the scope of Science Studies, particularly those focused on environmental science, anthropology, or cultural studies with an environmental focus.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Jibɔyɔrɔ sennataama (Political Science):** While politics can *influence* environmental issues, the passage focuses on the scientific and ecological aspects of the relationship.
* **B: Kunkokɔnɔ falenfɛnw fototali (Natural History):** Natural history is a component *within* Science Studies, but the passage describes a broader, interdisciplinary field.
* **D: Panni jɛgɛmɔli (Anthropology):** Anthropology *could* be relevant, particularly cultural anthropology, but the passage's emphasis on ecological relationships and conservation leans more towards a science-based approach.

Therefore, **Science Studies** is the most encompassing and accurate description of Kunkokanu yɔrɔlajɛli based on the information provided.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, tiransipɔri fɛrɛɛ sigile bɛ jumɛn kelen de ka?","The correct answer is **B: Tɔgɔla mɔbiliw (Cars)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Nin boli fɛn in kɔnɔ min be takasegikɛ, mɔgɔw be tugulen cogodɔla nin, **ani b'u jukɔrɔma dɔndɔn, tiransipɔri fɛrɛɛw la min sirileno no yɛrɛtɔgɔla mɔbiliw kan.**"" 
* This translates to: ""The most common thing that is bought, people spend money on, and **the most expensive item is the transportation vehicle that is used as a car.**""
* Therefore, the passage explicitly says that cars are the most expensive transportation vehicles.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baarayɔrɔw (People)**: While people buy cars, they are not the most expensive *item* being discussed.
* **C: Nimafɛw ka yɔrɔ kelen ɲɛnɛmaya (The amount of money that is needed for good life)**:  The passage mentions a large amount of money (one hundred million francs), but it doesn't say this amount is *needed* for a good life.
* **D: Hadamadenya sankɔrɔtali (The happiness of ancestors)**: This option is completely unrelated to the passage's content.



"
Paritikili minnu bɛ ka kɔnɔna munumunu kuran sugu jumɛn b’olu?,"The correct answer is **D: Kuran ɲuman ani batɔ** (Nuclear forces and forces).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kuran batɔ be elɛkitɔron na. Kuran ɲuman be purotɔnw la tumamina kuran foyisi tɛ neturɔn na.""  This translates to ""Forces are on electrons. Nuclear forces are responsible for protons and neutrons.""

* **The question asks:** ""What kind of forces hold the nucleus together?""

* **The passage directly links the nucleus's stability to nuclear forces (between protons and neutrons).**

Therefore, the answer encompasses both nuclear forces and the forces acting on electrons, which play a role in the overall stability of the atom, even though the direct holding together of the nucleus is attributed to nuclear forces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuran ɲuman (Nuclear forces):** While nuclear forces are crucial, the passage doesn't *solely* attribute the holding together of the nucleus to just nuclear forces.
* **B: Kuran fosi (Forces):**  This is too general. The passage distinguishes between different *types* of forces.
* **C: Kuran batɔ (Forces):**  This is also too general. The passage specifically mentions nuclear forces and the forces on electrons.



"
Kɔnɔna dilannen do ni paritikili jumɛnw ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Purotɔnw, neturɔnw, ani elɛkitɔrɔnw**.

The text states: ""Kuran batɔ be elɛkitɔron na. Kuran dilan ne dɔn ni paritiki fila ye: neturɔn ani purotɔn."" (Atoms are made of electrons. The fundamental particles are: neutrons and protons.)  It also mentions that protons and neutrons are in the nucleus.  Therefore, to be complete, it must include electrons.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jumɛn kelen de ye misali ye min ka dɔgɔ binari jateden duuru la?","The question describes a binary number system where each digit can be either 0 or 1.  It mentions that the computer processes these binary digits. The question asks for an example of a binary number that represents a given value.

The problem states that the computer's ""original"" input is a series of binary digits (0s and 1s).  The core of the question asks about the binary representation of a specific quantity. Since no specific quantity is given, we must infer that we are looking for a valid binary number among the options.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: 1010** - This is a valid binary number.  It can be converted to decimal as (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10.

*   **B: 12001** - This is not a valid binary number because it contains the digit '2', which is not allowed in binary.

*   **C: 10010** - This is a valid binary number. It can be converted to decimal as (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 18.

*   **D: 110101** - This is a valid binary number. It can be converted to decimal as (1 * 2^5) + (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 32 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 53.

The question asks for *an* example.  Any of the valid binary numbers could be an example. Without further context, we cannot choose one over another. However, assuming the question is looking for *a* simple valid binary number, option A (1010) might be preferable. But technically, all the other valid numbers satisfy the requirements.

Given the context of binary numbers and a computer input, all valid binary numbers are possible. Without additional information to guide the answer, it's impossible to give a definitive selection.  Since the question asks for an *example*, and there isn't a specific calculation to be done, any valid binary representation would fit the criteria.

Since the problem doesn't tell us what the target is, any one of the valid binary representations would answer the question.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1010}$"
Fila fila jatedenw bɛ se ka wele cogo wɛrɛ la di?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

Here's why:

The problem states: ""Jateden fila fila be seka waleri kelen walima fila dɔrɔn ne di, ani nin jateden be jateminɛ inafɔ fila fila jateden - walima bits..."" This translates to: ""The power of the exponent is a power of 2, and the exponent is always a power of 2 bits...""

Therefore, the exponent (the ""fila fila jateden"") is always a power of 2 bits, which means it's a number represented in binary, composed of bits (0s and 1s). The term ""bits"" directly refers to the fundamental units of digital information.
"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen de ma kofɔ tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ inafɔ kalanden ka bulɔguli nafa fɔlɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kan sariyaw ani sɛbɛncogo cɛɲi taɲɛ (Strategic communication and public relations)**.

Here's why:

The text states that strategic communication and public relations are used to manage the image of organizations. It mentions the use of the internet to disseminate information and build relationships with key stakeholders. This aligns perfectly with the definition of strategic communication and public relations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kalanden ɲɔgɔnw ka kiritikeli dɔgɔyali (Critical mass of critical organizations):** While critical organizations are mentioned, the focus isn't on the concept of a ""critical mass.""
*   **C: Lafaamuyali jɛnsɛlen kɛrɛfɛ mɔgɔw la (Mass media's influence on public opinion):**  The text discusses the internet and strategic communication, not solely the influence of mass media.
*   **D: Nege layɛlɛlen kalan nɔfɔ tugu la (The digital age's impact on organizations):** While the digital age is mentioned, the core focus is on *how* organizations use communication strategies within the digital age, not just the digital age's overall impact.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bulɔgu itilize ɲuman """"be seka fagan di kalandenw ma ka kɛ mirilili ani sɛgɛsɛgɛli kɛlaw ye; Nin ɛntɛrɛnɛti fɛnw jaabili ye, kalandenw be sek'u jɔyɔrɔw ɲɛfɔ mɔgɔ wɛrɛw ka sɛbɛni siratigɛla, ani be sek'u yɛrɛ hakilinaw fɔ kunbalan kɛrɛnkɛrɛnlen dɔ kuna (Ovarec, 2002).""

This translates to: ""The guide uses the term 'to search for information about calendars is easy; And the internet has enabled calendars to use information from many users strategically, and to search for scientific information from various scientific fields.""

Therefore, the internet and online resources are highlighted as ways to find information about calendars. Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the text.
"
Ninnu kelen jumɛn de nafa tɛ kalandenw ka kuma fɔnfɔni ye ɲɔgɔnkɔ? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ɛntɛrɛnɛti itilizeli inafɔ kalan kɛ minɛ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ɛntɛrɛnɛti itilizeli ani Diɲɛ Ɛrezoba Tugunlen siraw b'a to kalandenw be akisɛ sɔrɔ kunafonina waatibɛɛla.""  This translates to: ""The internet and the Diɲɛ Ɛrezoba Tugunlen network have brought about devices that can access knowledge and information.""

Option A, ""Ɛntɛrɛnɛti itilizeli inafɔ kalan kɛ minɛ"" (The internet has brought about devices that can access knowledge and information), directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka ɲɛ-ni-ɲɛ akisɛ sɔrɔ ni kalanfaw ye tile waati bɛ** (Because the device is able to access information and can present it in a useful way) - While true of the devices, the passage doesn't say *why* they can access information, only that they *do*.
* **C: Baarakɛwaati minnu bɛ ka falen** (Because the software is able to function) - The passage mentions software but doesn't explain its function in relation to accessing knowledge.
* **D: Konturoli u bɛrɛla** (Because the controls are able to operate) - The passage mentions controls but doesn't connect them to the ability to access knowledge.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu fɛnw kelen jumɛn kuma fɔnfɔni ye ɲɔgɔnkɔ tɛ se ka yɛlɛma kalandenw ye?","The correct answer is **D: Ɛntɛrɛnɛti itilizeli** (Internet utilities).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ɛntɛrɛnɛti itilizeli ani Diɲɛ Ɛrezoba Tugunlen siraw b'a to kalandenw be akisɛ sɔrɔ kunafonina waatibɛɛla.""  This translates to ""Internet utilities and search engines have led to the development of tools that help with finding information on the internet.""  The question asks *what* has led to the development of these tools. The answer directly points to internet utilities.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kalan kɛli bɛrɛla** (Free software): While free software *can* be used to create tools, the text doesn't directly link the development of these specific tools to free software.
* **B: Baarakɛwaatiw** (Search engines): Search engines are a *type* of internet utility, but the text is asking for the broader category that encompasses them.
* **C: Kalan kɛ minɛ** (Kalandenw be minɛ) (Utilities): While ""utilities"" is a general term, the text specifically mentions ""Internet utilities"".

Mun de ma kofɔ ni tɛmɛsira in na inafɔ fɛn min mɔgɔ bi se ka fara mejewali faamasow kan?,"Let's break down these questions and answers.

**Question P:** This is in Kikuyu, a language spoken in Kenya. It asks about the construction of the demolished house, the materials used, the techniques employed, and the challenges faced.  Essentially, it's asking for a detailed description of the building process.

**Question Q:** This is in a language I don't immediately recognize. Based on the sounds and some word structures, it *might* be a dialect of a language spoken in West Africa, possibly related to a language like Fula or a related group. It asks about the reason why a certain object/situation is being discussed. The core meaning seems to be asking ""What is the reason for this problem?"" or ""Why is this happening?"".

Now let's analyze the options for Q.  Without knowing the specific language, it's difficult to definitively say. However, based on the options and the general question, option **C: Sotigideya** is the most plausible. It sounds like it could be a response meaning ""It's because of..."" or ""The reason is...""

**Therefore, based on my analysis, the most likely correct answer is C: Sotigideya.**  (While I can't be 100% sure without knowing the exact language.)



"
Ninnu kelen jumɛn de ma kofɔ ni tɛmɛsira in na inafɔ kasa walima mankan min tun bi ka fɛrɛ ye faamaso tiɲɛniw na?,"Let's break down the questions and answers.

**Question P (Swahili):** This question asks about the construction of the houses of the people who were harmed. It specifically mentions the use of mud, wood, and thatch, and describes the houses as having no windows and being vulnerable to the wind. It then asks *how* they were built, *what* the houses looked like, and *how* they were damaged.

**Question Q (Unknown Language):**  This question is in a language I don't recognize.  My analysis tools can't translate it, so I can't answer it.

**Answer Options:** The options are all in the same unknown language as Question Q.

**Therefore, I can only provide an answer to question P's *structure*, not its content.**  The question is asking for details about building techniques and characteristics of damaged houses.

**Since I can't answer question Q**, and there's no information to connect the two questions, I can't choose a correct answer from the options provided.

**I need a translation of Question Q to be able to help you.**

Ninnu kelen jumɛn de bi faamaso Kirby Muxloe cogoya jaati ɲɛfɔ ka?,"The correct answer is **B: A tun mako bɛ kogopɛnpɛrɛnlen fitini na ka sabu kɛ jamana ka bɛn ye jɔli waati la.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""A ka filantɛrɛnɔrɔlenbaw ni kogopɛnpɛrɛnlenw ye waatijankɛlɛbuniw kun."" This translates to ""It was a place where philanthropists and those with great wealth lived.""
* **It also states:** ""1480 sanw kɔnɔ, a jɔli daminɛlen Lord Hastings fɛ, kayira tun bɛ jamana fanbɛ la ani lakana tun bɛ ɲini fo ni coolokuluni dɔw tun nana binkani na."" This translates to ""In 1480, it belonged to Lord Hastings, and it was a place where people of high standing lived and enjoyed the comfort of great houses.""

Option B accurately reflects this:  ""It was a place where philanthropists and those with great wealth lived because it was a place of high standing in its time.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Faamaso tata kogow tun laɲininen do Lord Hastings fɛ** (The manor belonged to Lord Hastings): While true, it doesn't explain *why* Kirby Muxloe was important.
* **C: Faamaso jɔli tun ta damana ko ye o waati** (The manor was built with its wealth):  The text says people *lived* there because of their wealth, not that the manor itself was built *with* the wealth.
* **D: A tun jɔla walasa ka mɛn kosɔbɛ ani ka kɛlɛ gɛlɛw kunbɛn** (It was used for hunting and catching wild animals): There's no mention of hunting in the text.



"
Ninnu so jɔli nafaw kelen jumɛn de tun bi se ka jate a damana ko Faamaso Kirby Muxloe la waati kofɔlen na ni tɛmɛsira in na?,"The correct answer is **C: Tatakogo jɔli ka dɔgɔ ka tɛmɛn faamaso ka** (The great claim of the time of the Faamaso).

Here's why:

* The passage states that in 1480, Faamaso Kirby Muxloe claimed the title of Lord Hastings and asserted his right to the lands and possessions of the former lord. This claim was a significant one, putting him in a powerful position.
* The question asks *why* Faamaso Kirby Muxloe's claim was significant.  The passage implicitly links his claim to the power and status associated with being Lord Hastings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Finɛtiribaw (Frenchmen):** While Frenchmen might have been involved in the political landscape, the passage doesn't directly connect Faamaso Kirby Muxloe's claim to them.
* **B: Subasema jɔlendo ka min mɛn ka kɛlɛ kunbɛn (The demands of those who were previously in power):** While there might have been demands from previous holders of power, the passage focuses on Kirby Muxloe's *assertion* of a claim, not merely responding to demands.
* **D: Kogopɛnpɛrɛnlenw (The nobility):**  The nobility were involved in the political situation, but the passage focuses on the specific significance of Kirby Muxloe's individual claim.

Therefore, **C** best captures the reason for the importance of Faamaso Kirby Muxloe's claim – it was a major assertion of power and right in that time."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de bɛ nafa ba se bolikɛla ma min bɛ k’a labɛn waati nata kama?","The correct answer is **A: Ka jamana cɛci bolikɛ tilema waatila**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dɔw bolotɔ be jamana cɛci nɛnɛ waatila..."" which translates to ""The older people [of the tribe] have been using [the technology] for a long time...""
* **The question asks:** ""What has been used for a long time?""
* **Option A directly reflects this information.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka sinsin teliya matarafali kan degeli waatila:** This translates to ""The young people use the technology to play and have fun."" While the young people might use it, the passage emphasizes the long history of its use by older generations.
* **C: Ka sanga saba bugɔ:** This translates to ""They sing seven songs."" This is irrelevant to the passage's content.
* **D: Farikoloɲɛnajɛyɔrɔ itilizeli ye ka sanfɛ farikolo fanw bɔɲɔnalibaaraw kɛ:** This translates to ""The foreign people rely on the foreign technology and use the foreign products."" This is about foreign influence, not the long-standing use by the tribe.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de nafa ka bon kilimɛtiri tilancɛ boliba kosɛbɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Ka teliya matarafa ni jija ye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dɔw bolotɔ be jamana cɛci nɛnɛ waatila, nin sanfɛ farikolo fanw bɔɲɔnalibaaraw tuguli y'ala, ye labɛni waati ɲɛnɛma ye kabɛn bolili waatima.""

This translates to: ""The distance the car travels is short, and the fuel it uses is not much, so it uses a little fuel to continue its journey.""

This indicates that the car's range (how far it can travel on a tank of fuel) is determined by the **fuel consumption (jija)** and the amount of fuel it has (teliya).  The car doesn't travel a certain distance *because* of the fuel consumption or distance. It travels *based on* the fuel's capacity to power the engine and the engine's efficiency in using that fuel.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka jamana cɛci bolikɛ samiya kalow kɔnɔ** (The car travels a short distance because of the short distance traveled): The passage says the distance is *short*, but it doesn't state that the *travel* is *because* of the distance.
*   **B: Ka jijali matarafa ni teliya ye** (It's the fuel consumption and fuel that matter): While fuel consumption and fuel *are* involved, this option doesn't fully capture the relationship.  It's not just *that* they matter; it's *how* they interact to determine the distance the car can travel.
*   **C: Ka se ka kɔn sanga fila ɲɛ** (It's because it's not a long distance): The passage mentions the distance is short, but it doesn't say that the shortness of the distance *causes* the car to travel that distance.

"Farikoloɲɛnɛjɛra dɔ fɛ, fɔta jumɛn de tɛ se ka sɔrɔ dumuniɲumannafama waleyaw dɔrɔn fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Dɔfaralen farikolo se kan**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What do the rumors say about the future of the factory owners?"" (translated from ""Farikoloɲɛnɛjɛra dɔ fɛ, fɔta jumɛn de tɛ se ka sɔrɔ dumuniɲumannafama waleyaw dɔrɔn fɛ?"")

* **The text states:** ""Farikolo kɛnɛya barika dakɛɲɛnali marali, jimi waleyaw ɲuma barali ani dafana fɛnw cogoya cama famuya be seka farikoloɲɛnɛjɛra dɛmɛ ka ka dɔfara a farikolo se kan ani ka ka farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ damu bɔnɲa."" (translated from ""The factory owners are in a difficult situation, and the rumors say that the factory owners will be forced to sell their factories and that the factory owners will be able to make a good profit."")

* **Therefore, the rumors say the factory owners will be forced to sell their factories.**  Option A, ""Dɔfaralen farikolo se kan"" (translated from ""The sale of the factory""), accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Damu bɔnɲalen (Good profit):** The text says they *can* make a good profit *from the sale*, not that a good profit is their future.
* **C: Sanfɛla farikolo se (Sell the factory):** While related, the question asks about *rumors* about their future, not simply a statement of what *will* happen. The more accurate answer is about the *act of selling*.
* **D: Kɛnɛya (Keen/Eager):** This doesn't relate to the future of the factory owners.

"Ka da nin tɛmɛsira in ka, fɔta jumɛn ma poropoze i n’a fɔ sira dɔ min b’a to farikoloɲɛnɛjɛla denmisɛniw walasa k’u farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ damu bɔnɲa sɔrɔ?","The correct answer is **D: Farikolo kɛnɛya barika dakɛɲɛnali marali**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks: ""What is the reason that the community is looking for other skilled workers besides the skilled workers who are making good products?""  Essentially, why are they seeking more workers?

* **The text (P)** states: ""The skilled workers in the community are looking for other skilled workers to have the ability to make things that are *more* valuable."" This implies they're seeking people who can produce *higher quality* or *more valuable* goods than the current skilled workers.

* **Option D: Farikolo kɛnɛya barika dakɛɲɛnali marali** translates to ""The skilled workers are looking for workers with advanced skills.""  This directly addresses the need for workers who can produce goods of higher value, as stated in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dumuniɲumannafama yɛrɛ yɛrɛ waleyaw** translates to ""The community's living conditions are getting better."" While this might be a general positive outcome, it doesn't explain the specific reason for seeking *more* skilled workers.
* **B: Sanfɛla farikolo baara tuma bɛɛ** translates to ""The skilled workers are starting to be a lot."" This is irrelevant to the question about seeking *more* workers.
* **C: Jimi waleyaw ɲuman** translates to ""The community's abundance."" Again, this is a general statement and doesn't address the specific need for skilled workers with advanced skills.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Muna yɔrɔ camancɛ bolila bɛ se ka fɛnw san minnu da ka gɛlɛn?","The correct answer is **C: A bɛ na nafa ba se u ka farikolo se ma.**

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** describes a situation where people are using tools (farikolo) to get food. However, these tools are causing problems (fitiniw). The passage highlights that these tools are causing a decline in the amount of food available.

* **Q (the question)** asks what the reason is for the food shortage that is happening because of the tools.

* **A (O y’olu yɛrɛ diyaɲɛfɛn de ye)** - This translates to ""It is because people are being careless."" While carelessness might contribute, it's not the *reason* for the decline in food.

* **B (A y’a nafaw jira)** - This translates to ""There is a drought.""  The passage doesn't mention drought.

* **C (A bɛ na nafa ba se u ka farikolo se ma)** - This translates to ""They have started to use the tools (farikolo) to the point where the food is decreasing."" This directly addresses the passage's main point - the tools are causing the food shortage.

* **D (Famuyabaliya dɔw bɛ fɛn danɔngɔnw dafɛ)** - This translates to ""The powerful ones are taking the food for themselves."" While this could be a contributing factor, the passage primarily focuses on the tools themselves as the cause of the decline in food.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the passage's explanation for the food shortage.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, yɔrɔ camancɛ bolili be mun de laɲini?","The correct answer is **C: Fɛn fitininin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yɔrɔ camancɛ bolili ye cogola farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ nɔgɔmani ye; nka, famuyabaliya beyi ka ɲesin fɛn fitiniw minunw be laɲinin ka dɔn la."" This translates to: ""The people have become accustomed to the authority of the chiefs; therefore, they willingly obey the law and respect the judgments of the chiefs.""

The question asks: ""What has the people's accustomedness to the chiefs' authority led to?""

The answer is: ""The people have willingly obeyed the law and respect the judgments of the chiefs.""  This is directly stated as ""ɲesin fɛn fitiniw minunw be laɲinin ka dɔn la,"" meaning ""they willingly obey the law and respect the judgments.""  Therefore, ""Fɛn fitininin"" (respect for the judgments/laws) is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fɛn caman** (the people's accustomedness): While this is part of the sentence, it doesn't answer the question of *what* that accustomedness led to.
* **B: Farikoloɲɛnajɛ dɔnniya banbannen** (the chiefs' diverse judgments): The text mentions judgments, but the question isn't about the judgments themselves; it's about the *result* of the people's obedience to those judgments.
* **D: Wari caman** (other accustomedness): The text only discusses accustomedness to the chiefs' authority, so this is incorrect.



"
Jɔn ye nikilerɛri makan bɔlen kodɔn? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch ni Purcell**.

The text states: ""Nin ni makan ye, ɛman foro and aradiyo jikuruw be seka to atomuw be siɲali fitiniw di. San ba 1930 kɔnɔ Felix Bloch fɛ (be baara kɛ Stanford Sanfɛkalansola) ani Edward Purcell (Kabɔ Harvard Sanfɛkalansola)."" This directly identifies Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell as the discoverers of NMR.

While Raymond Damadian is mentioned later in the text for developing MRI, the question specifically asks about the discovery of NMR.
"
San jumɛn tigiya sɛbɛn dira dɔgɔtɔrɔ nikilerɛri makan bɔlen tɔgɔla? ,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

The passage states: ""San ba 1977, Dɔkitɛri Damadian ye """"farikolo fɔlɔ"""" dilani dafan, MRI sɛgɛsɛgɛlikɛna, a ye min wele ko """"bukɔbali""""."" This translates to ""In 1977, Doctor Damadian invented the first MRI scanner, which is what we call 'revolutionary'.""

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, adamadenw kan ka faamuyaliba sɔrɔ mun de kan walasa ka tɔw ka ko dogonin dɔw ɲɛnabɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Danaya**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes how humans are clever and inventive.** They create tools and technologies to make their lives easier. The example of using a mobile phone is a clear illustration of this.
* **The question asks *why* humans are able to invent and create tools.**
* **""Danaya"" (meaning cleverness, ingenuity, or inventiveness) best captures the reason.**  The text highlights the ability to think creatively and solve problems, which is the essence of inventiveness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nege (Yes):** While the text implies humans *can* invent, it doesn't directly answer *why* they do.
* **B: Ŋaniya (No):** This is the opposite of what the text suggests.
* **D: Yecogo (Luck):** The text emphasizes cleverness and skill, not luck.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ŋaniya famuyali bɛ adamaden dɛmɛ ka mun kɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Ka tɔw hakilina kalan (It is about having different qualities/characteristics)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Adamadenw as having diverse qualities.** It mentions qualities like being quick-witted, clever, and capable of different skills (like fixing things). 
* **The question asks what the qualities of Adamadenw are.**
* **Option D directly reflects this description.**  ""Hakilina kalan"" translates to having different qualities or characteristics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka danabaliya bɔ adamaden ka dogoninw dɔw kofɛ (It is about respecting the different qualities of people).** While related, the passage *describes* the qualities, not the act of respecting them.
* **B: Ka negew ɲɛfɔ (It is about knowledge).**  The passage mentions knowledge and skills, but it's broader than just knowledge.
* **C: Ka adamaden tɔw lajɛ kasɔrɔ jalakili tɛ (It is about people being good at different things).** This is close, but ""hakilina kalan"" (different qualities) is a more encompassing and accurate description based on the passage.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn ye AI ka kuntilenna jɔnjɔn ye?","The correct answer is **A: Pilanifikasiyɔni (Planning)**.

Here's why:

* The text describes how AI is used to automate and optimize various processes, including planning, scheduling, and logistics. It mentions things like ""bilalisenkan"" (scheduling), ""pilantifikasiyɔni"" (planning), and optimizing resource allocation.
* The question asks what AI is used for *in the text*.
* Option A, ""Pilanifikasiyɔni,"" directly aligns with the text's explanation of AI's role in automating and improving planning processes.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is planning."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de jɛlen do ni AI waati dɔw?","The correct answer is **B: Bilalisenkan ani pilanifikasiyɔni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Misaliw dɔw ye sɛgɛsɛgɛli ye, **bilalisenkan ani pilanifikasiyɔni**, se ka kiliyanw ka ɲininkaliw jaabi ani tigɛla sɛbɛni dɔnli, kan ani ɲɛda.""

This directly translates to: ""Examples include, **licensing and planning**, which allow people to easily access and manage important information, and produce it.""

The question asks what is a use case of AI in the given context.  Licensing and planning are specifically mentioned as use cases.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɔta jumɛn de ye mɔgɔ ka fanga ye mɔgɔ min bɛ miiricogokɛ min bɛ ɲɔgɔn sɔrɔ?","The question asks: ""If someone is experiencing a headache, what is the most appropriate thing to do?""

Here's a breakdown of the options and why the answer is what it is:

* **A: Ka yirali kɛ jaabi ɲuman cama na kungo kelen na** (If you take a medicine to cure the headache and go to the doctor) - This is a less direct and potentially unnecessary step for a simple headache.
* **B: Ka fɛɛrɛ kuraw labaara kungo dɔ la** (You should go to the laboratory to take a test) - A lab test is usually *not* necessary for a typical headache.
* **C: K’u ka tan ta ka kungo ɲɛnabɔ** (You should look for a doctor) - While seeking medical advice *can* be a good idea, it's not the *most appropriate* first step for a common headache.  It's a bit too broad.
* **D: Ka cogoyaw durusi** (You should rest) - **This is the best answer.** Rest is a common and often effective way to treat a headache.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D: Ka cogoyaw durusi.** (You should rest)."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛŋ de tɛ jate inafɔ sinsinyɔrɔ mɔgɔw ka hakilina la minnu miiricogokɛ bɛ ɲɔgɔn sɔrɔ?","The question asks: ""If we are to research it, how should we study the research of those who have conducted research on the same subject?""

The correct answer is **A: K’a famu ko jaabi ɲuman kelen dɔrɔn de bɛ yen**.

This translates to: ""If we are to research it, we should look at the original sources.""

Here's why:

* **The text describes how scientists build upon existing knowledge.** They study previous research, analyze data, and use scientific methods to understand phenomena.
* **Option A directly aligns with this process.** It emphasizes the importance of examining the initial research papers and sources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: K’i ka waati ta:** (This doesn't make sense and is likely a typo).
* **C: Ka yirali kɛ kow la:** (This translates to ""Maybe it's the same thing""). While previous research might be similar, simply stating this doesn't explain *how* to study it.
* **D: Ka kunafiniw fara ɲɔgɔn kan:** (This translates to ""Maybe we should avoid looking at other sources""). This is completely contradictory to the scientific method.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Widewo dilan natilli y'an sama ka ɲɛɲiniliw nafan ma cama kɛ farikolo tabolo finitiw ɲɛfɔlila..."" which translates to ""Some people are able to solve finite-time problems using a specific type of memory...""
* **The question asks:** ""What is the timeframe for these finite-time problems?"" which translates to ""What is the timeframe for these finite-time problems?""
* **The text further states:** ""...minunw ye milisekɔndi damadami dɔrɔn."" which translates to ""...in milliseconds.""
* **Therefore, the answer is:** ""Ka yɔrɔwɛrɛ lajɛ n’i bɛ kumana"" meaning ""They can be solved in milliseconds.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: K’i ɲɛ sisi** (It's simple) - The text describes a specific type of memory and a problem-solving technique, so it's not simple.
* **C: K‘i ɲɛ kɔmi teliyala** (It's a phone call) - This is irrelevant to the topic.
* **D: Ka bolonkɔni kumaba lawuli** (It's a religious matter) - This is also irrelevant to the topic.

Ninnu kumasen jumɛn de tɛ tiɲɛ ye farikolo tabolo finiti ɲɛfɔli kan?,"The correct answer is **D: A be seka dɛmɛlikɛ ka jɛlenya sɛgɛsɛgɛ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oiver Sacks, a ka sɛbɛn kɔnɔ The President's Speech, ya jira cogomina mɔgɔ minunw tɛ seka kuma famuya ka sababu kɛ nzɛbɛn cɛnliye, be seka jɛlenya sɛgɛsɛgɛ kaɲɛ kosɛbɛ.""  This translates to: ""Oliver Sacks, a worker for The President's Speech, found that the nervous system is prone to sudden, involuntary spasms.""

The question asks what causes the involuntary spasms in the finite table. The text directly links these spasms to sudden, involuntary spasms of the nervous system. Option D, ""A be seka dɛmɛlikɛ ka jɛlenya sɛgɛsɛgɛ"" which translates to ""It is caused by sudden, involuntary spasms"", accurately reflects this connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Widewo dilan y'an sama ka taa ɲɛtaa nafamanbaw ma** - This translates to ""The finite table is a complex network of nerves."" While true, it doesn't explain *why* the spasms occur.
* **B: ɲɛfɔli cogo ɲuman bɛ se ka nkalon ye** - This translates to ""The nervous system is prone to involuntary spasms.""  This is close but doesn't link the spasms *to* the finite table specifically.
* **C: Kumakan ani ɲɛda cogoyaw ɲɛfɔlen do** - This translates to ""It is the connection between the nerves and the brain."" This is related, but the text focuses on the involuntary spasms *within* the nervous system, not just the connection to the brain.



"
Ninnu jumɛn nafa boɲana kosɛbɛ k’a sabu jɛ Renaissance ye? ,"The correct answer is **A: Mɔgɔ kelen ka mirila (The great thinkers)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Duguma jateminɛla, Renaissance ye yɛlɛma ba dɔn kalanli fɛɛrɛ la ani dɔni carilila."" (In the past, the Renaissance was a time when people began to value reason and knowledge.)  It also mentions that ""Piresiyon tɛyi tuguni mɔgɔ kelen ka mirila, nka mirili gafe la se kɛra piriyorite ba ye."" (Reason began to be valued by the great thinkers, so the Enlightenment became a crucial period.) This clearly indicates that the great thinkers were central to the Renaissance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dɔni ka yaala la (The rich people):** While wealth might have played a role in supporting the Renaissance, the *driving force* was the intellectual movement of thinkers.
* **C: Mirili gafe (The Enlightenment):** The Enlightenment *followed* the Renaissance, building upon its ideas.
* **D: Kunafoni sɔrɔli (The artisans):** Artisans were important during the Renaissance, but not the primary reason for its emergence.

Therefore, the **great thinkers** are the most accurate answer.
"
"K’a sabu kɛ Renaissance ye, sinsinni dɔgɔyara ninnu jumɛn de kan?","The correct answer is **A: Mɔgɔ kelen ka mirila (The people who were struggling)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Duguma jateminɛla, Renaissance ye yɛlɛma ba dɔn kalanli fɛɛrɛ la ani dɔni carilila.""  This translates to: ""In addition, the Renaissance was a time when people were struggling and seeking new knowledge.""  The phrase ""ba dɔn kalanli fɛɛrɛ la ani dɔni carilila"" means ""were struggling and seeking new knowledge.""  The question asks what group of people were struggling *because* of the Renaissance. Therefore, ""Mɔgɔ kelen ka mirila"" (The people who were struggling) is the most accurate answer.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dɔni sɔrɔli (The wealthy):** The text doesn't connect the Renaissance with the wealthy.
* **C: Mirili gafe (The poor):** While the Renaissance impacted the poor, the text focuses on the *struggle* of people in general.
* **D: Kunafoni carili (The educated):** While education was valued, the text emphasizes the struggle and search for *new* knowledge, not just existing education.

Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ kun jira ka ɛntɛrinɛti labaara jɛɲɔgɔnya min bɛ taɲɛ kama?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka to jɛɲɔgɔnya la ni denbaya ye**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""How did the internet make it possible to share information between people and different groups?""
* **The text states:** ""Intanet nĩĩingĩranĩtie mĩario ya mũingĩ na ya gatagatĩ ka mũndũ na ũrĩa ũngĩ."" This translates to ""The internet has facilitated the sharing of information between others and different groups of people.""
* **Option B translates to:** ""It is possible to share it with anyone."" This aligns perfectly with the text's description of the internet's ability to connect people and facilitate information sharing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jagokɛlaw ka jɛɲɔgɔnya:** This translates to ""It is possible to communicate."" While the internet facilitates communication, the question specifically asks about information *sharing*.
* **C: Dugu taa ɲinini:** This translates to ""It is not possible."" This contradicts the entire premise of the text.
* **D: Mɔgɔ kuraw dɔnni:** This translates to ""It is a complex problem."" The text doesn't frame the internet's ability to share information as a complex problem.



"
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ kun jira ka ɛntɛrinɛti labaara mɔgɔ yɛrɛ sendonni kama?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka dumunidɔ nafɛnw n’a tobicogo ɲini**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""How does the internet make it possible to be connected to others?"" (translated from the Swahili).
* **The text describes:** The internet connecting people and allowing them to communicate in various ways. It mentions actions like ""chatting"" and ""flirting"" as examples of online interactions.
* **Option A (Ka dumunidɔ nafɛnw n’a tobicogo ɲini) translates to:** ""By connecting to a common topic."" This is the most accurate answer because the internet facilitates connection through shared interests and discussions (tobiogo means topic or subject).  The text emphasizes communication and interaction based on shared spaces.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ka bilikɛ ɛntɛrineti barokɛyɔrɔ dɔ kan** (The internet is simply a tool): While true, it doesn't explain *how* the internet enables connections.
* **C: Ka kɛnɛya fɛnw ɲini** (By just being present): Being present online doesn't automatically lead to connection.  It requires interaction.
* **D: Ka nafolo ko ɲɛnabɔ** (By following a certain path):  This is too vague and doesn't reflect the nature of online connectivity.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nka k'a da kunnafonidi siraw sumaya kan, Erɔpu taabolow tun be se ka to kɔ ni san 25 k'a se 30 ma.""  This directly translates to ""However, due to the development of writing, European tables were to be about 25 to 30 times greater.""  This refers to the time period of the late Middle Ages (Cɛmancɛ Waati laban yɔrɔw la), which is roughly the 13th-15th centuries.  The 25-30 is an estimate of the size increase compared to earlier tables.

The text states: ""Kuruniw labaarali ye ka donfiniw datugu. Gotik taabolo ye Sanba tanifilafili kɛra sankɛmɛsigi 10na, 11na ni 14na."" This translates to: ""The ancient rulers were very tall. Gothic tables are very tall, with a height of 10th, 11th, and 14th (units of measurement).""

Therefore, the text directly links the ancient rulers (kuruniw labaarali) to the Gothic period.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de jatelen do inafɔ waatijan fɛɛrɛ min be se ka kɛ diɲɛ kunkow la?","The correct answer is **A: Balocogo damatɛmɛlen sugandili boyikoteli**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the negative effects of modern technology and chemical substances on the environment and human health.** It mentions things like pollution from industry and agriculture, and the potential dangers of chemical products.
* **The question asks for a solution to prevent the contamination of water.**
* **""Balocogo damatɛmɛlen sugandili boyikoteli"" (Banned fragrant chemical substances)** directly addresses the problem by suggesting the banning of chemicals that cause water pollution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko dɔw kɛlɛli (Local cleaning)** - While cleaning is helpful, it doesn't prevent the *source* of the pollution.
* **C: kunkow kun dɔnni (Clean water source)** - This is a desired outcome, not a solution to *prevent* contamination.
* **D: Ka jɛɲɔgɔnya kɛ ni diɲɛ kɔlɔlisili kulula (Using traditional, natural cleaning agents)** - While natural agents can be better, they aren't explicitly presented as a primary solution in the passage. The passage focuses on the impact of *modern* chemicals.



Therefore, the answer that best aligns with the passage's focus and addresses the question of preventing water contamination is **A**."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de jatelen tɛ inafɔ bana tamasiyɛn furakɛli diɲɛ kungow la?","The correct answer is **D: Ka balo ni diɲɛ teriya cogoyaw ye kosɛbɛ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes the benefits of technology and knowledge.** It states that understanding and applying knowledge and technology is essential for the progress of humanity and for overcoming problems. 
* **The question (Q) asks what is necessary for human progress.**
* **Option D directly reflects the passage's central theme:** ""To utilize knowledge and technology for the benefit of humanity.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: K’i sen don kɛlɛw la (It's a good thing)** - While true, it doesn't specify *what* is a good thing in the context of progress.
* **B: Ka kunbalan jujɔnw balili ka baara kɛ (To use knowledge and innovation for overcoming problems)** - This is related but doesn't encompass the broader idea of progress as described.
* **C: Ka kumakan bila balocogo damatɛmɛlen sugandili balili ma (To develop scientific and technological advancements)** - This is a part of progress, but not the whole concept presented in the passage. It's too narrow.



Therefore, **D** is the best answer because it encompasses the overall message of the passage regarding the importance of knowledge and technology for human progress.

The text states: ""Ɛsipaɲi fanga yɛlɛmayɛlɛma kɛlɛ ye kɛlɛ fɔlɔdaminɛ yira min jujɔn tun ye fangalatilen ye."" which translates to ""Spanish has the largest number of countries that use French as an official language.""

Therefore, the question asks which country *doesn't* have French as an official language. The text implies that Spain is the country with the most countries using French, thus it's the one *not* having it as a primary official language.

Nin yɔrɔ jumɛnw de la Egilizi Katoliki tun tɛ ka sɛgɛsɛgɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebaaya lajɛlicogo Egilizi kɔnɔ**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Why did the Catholic Church become so powerful?""
* **The provided text explains:** The Catholic Church gained power through a combination of factors:
    *  It was the only institution providing guidance and comfort in a chaotic world.
    *  It claimed to have divine authority (the Pope as God's representative on Earth).
    *  It controlled land and wealth.
    *  It persecuted those who disagreed with it.
* **Option C (Sebaaya lajɛlicogo Egilizi kɔnɔ)** translates to ""The religious authority of the Church."" This directly reflects the text's explanation of the Church's power stemming from its claim to divine authority and control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ni nafolomanfɛnw tilacogo tun bɛnnen don Egilisi kɔnɔ** - ""It was the people who supported the Church."" While popular support contributed, it wasn't the *reason* for its power.
* **B: Ni diinɛ sariya jɔnjɔnw kan ka ladilan** - ""It was the only religion that was established."" While it *was* the dominant religion, being the ""only established religion"" doesn't explain *why* it became so powerful.
* **D: Ni Egilizi sariya jɔnjɔnw tun bɛ ka dafa** - ""It was the religious power of the Church."" This is too general; Option C provides a more specific and accurate explanation.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn de fagara Versailles ?","The correct answer is **D: Lakanabaa dɔ** (The people).

The text states: ""Waati dɔ selen, jaman in mɔgɔ dɔ ye Masa lakanabaa dɔ kunkolo yanga min fagara Versailles Masamuso jatigɛlen ɲɛna."" This translates to: ""At that time, the people were the ones who, in a great fury, stormed Versailles and forced the royal family to return."" 

Therefore, the people were the ones who forced the royal family to leave Versailles.

"Ninnu na, mun de jagoya Massakɛ ni Masamuso kan Jama fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: U ka sowotoro finɛtiriw dayɛlɛli** (They went to the people's court).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sowotoro dɔ kɔnɔ, u seginna Pari u lamininen jaman dɔ fɛ minnu be kule ni kankari da la Masakɛ ni Masamuso ma."" This translates to ""Soon after, they went to Paris and entered a period of intense anxiety and fear of the Massacre and the Revolution."" The phrase ""sowotoro finɛtiriw dayɛlɛli"" refers to going to the people's court or public sphere, which is where the anxiety and fear arose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: U ka bɔ Versailles yɔrɔninkelen** (They went to Versailles): The text mentions they went to Paris, not Versailles.
*   **C: Lakanabaa dɔ kunkolo tigɛlen lajɛli** (The nobles who were fleeing Versailles): While nobles were fleeing Versailles, the question asks *why* the Massacre and Revolution began, not *who* was fleeing.
*   **D: Kɔsiginin ka taa Paris** (They started in Paris): While they did end up in Paris, the text says they went *to* Paris *after* the initial events. The text does not state they began in Paris.

* **Translation:** ""Britain is a large country that has a lot of capital and a powerful economy, but it is a country that is experiencing a decline in its currency value.  Because of the currency crisis, Germany has decided to buy a large amount of British bonds and invest in them.""
* **The question asks:** ""Why did Germany decide to buy British bonds?""
* **The text explains:** Germany bought the bonds because Britain's currency value was declining.

Therefore, option A, ""Germany decided to buy British bonds because Britain's currency value was falling,"" is the accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kurun minnu tun sen tɛ fosi la, olu bilala farati la (The country's economy is strong, it has a declining currency).** This is partially true, but it doesn't explain *why* Germany bought the bonds.
* **C: Yɛlɛmaw donna diɲɛlamini sariya (The currency is not experiencing a crisis).** This is directly contradicted by the text.
* **D: Fɛn nafamanbaw tun tɛ se ka sɔrɔ (The currency is stable).**  This is also contradicted by the text.

* The text states: ""Beretaɲi ye Alimaɲi jisira datugun.

(Britain and Germany are cooperating. The collaboration involves large-scale projects and a partnership based on the shared history of the two countries.)

Option A directly reflects this statement about a ""large-scale collaboration.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A ye Alimaɲi ka jijukɔrɔkɛlɛ lawuli (It is Germany's high-level commitment):** While Germany is committed, the text emphasizes the *joint* effort, not just Germany's commitment.
* **C: A ye Alimaɲi ka minɛnkumabaw tɛmɛni bali (It is Germany's extensive economic power):** The text mentions economic aspects, but the primary focus is on the collaboration itself, not solely Germany's economic strength.
* **D: A y’a sabati kurun minnu tɛ mɔgɔsi ta ye olu kana bila farati la (There is a shared history between the two countries that is built on lessons learned):** While the shared history is important, the text highlights the *ongoing collaboration*, not just the historical basis.

"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, a ka c’a la mɔgɔ jumɛn de bɛ se ka sɛgɛ ko nsɛmɛ bana yer’a la?","The text states that there are approximately 400,000 people with mental disorders (MD) in America. It then asks how many people with mental disorders are treated with medication. The text says that the medication treatment rate is 32%.

Therefore, to find the number of people with mental disorders treated with medication, we need to calculate 32% of 400,000.

Calculation: 0.32 * 400,000 = 128,000

Looking at the options:

*   A: Muso san 32 dɔ (32 thousand)
*   B: Cɛ san 15 dɔ (15 thousand)
*   C: Cɛ san 43 dɔ (43 thousand)
*   D: Muso san 10 dɔ (10 thousand)

None of the options match the calculated result of 128,000. However, there might be a typo in the provided options. The question probably meant to ask, ""how many *thousand* people with mental disorders are treated with medication?"" In that case, 128,000 would be 128 thousand.

Let's re-examine the text. There seems to be an error in the answer choices. Since 32% of 400,000 is 128,000, we need to find which answer is closest to that number. However, the answer choice ""Muso san 32 dɔ"" is nowhere near 128,000.

The correct answer should be 128,000. Since that's not an option, let's examine the options and see if there's any logic to them.

The closest option is none. However, let's consider that the numbers in the options are in thousands. If we rephrase the question to, ""how many *thousand* people with mental disorders are treated with medication?"", then we can choose the option that is closest to 128. 

Since the question provided options in thousands, there's likely a typo. Assuming the question meant ""how many *thousands* of people...?"", we are looking for an option closest to 128. 

None of the options are close to 128. It's possible the numbers in the text are incorrect or there is a typo in the question. 

Since the percentages were correct (32%), and the question specifically asks for people treated with medication (32%), and there is a strong indication of an error in the response options. The most probable error has to be a typo.

Based on this error in response options, and the requirement to pick an option from the choices, none of the options is correct.

However, one possible intention for the question, could have been ""How many people are treated with medication *per thousand people*"", the correct answer is still 32%, and given that it's probably a typo, let's pick the one that is most close to this answer (128).

None of these answers makes logical sense.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{Muso san 32 dɔ}$"
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, minnu b'u sedɔn nin baara jɔlenw na olu mako bɛ dɛmɛ caman na ka ɲɛsin mun ma?","The correct answer is **A: Dimi yeli cogojuguma** (The reason is the great hunger).

Here's why:

* **P (The Problem):** The text describes a severe famine (""Ɲɛninli"") where people are starving (""jɔrɔ""). The cause is a lack of food and drought (""dɔngɔndɔn boli boli"").
* **Q (The Question):** The question asks for the reason why the people are suffering so much.
* **A (The Answer):** The answer ""Dimi yeli cogojuguma"" directly states that the reason for the suffering is the great hunger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kɔ duguma dimi (The great drought):** While drought is *a cause* of the famine, the text explicitly states the core issue is the hunger caused by the lack of food.
* **C: Jigitigɛ (Famine):** This is the state of being in a famine, not the *reason* for it.
* **D: Siran (Sickness):** The text doesn't mention sickness as a cause of the famine.

Therefore, the most accurate answer to the question ""Why are the people suffering so much?"" is ""The reason is the great hunger."""
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, a ka c'a la ɛsikirimu be zuye cogodi?","The correct answer is **D: ɲɔgɔndan cogoya la** (the bodybuilders).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Farikoloɲɛnajɛ kura ɛsikirimu be zuye niwo cama na, ka daminɛ sanfɛ kalandenw la minunw y'a kalan sanfɛ kalansola ka ta bila a dɔn ba nganaw la Olɛnpiki tulɔnkɛla la.""
   * Translation: ""Bodybuilders eat protein and drink milk, and many athletes who train hard have won medals at the Olympic Games.""
* **The second sentence states:** ""Farikoloɲɛnajɛ in be zuye fɔlɔfɔlɔ ɲɔgɔndan cogoyala, ɛsikirimlu zuyeba kelen ani dɔwɛrɛ.""
   * Translation: ""Bodybuilders drink a lot of protein shakes, and also eat a lot of meat.""

The question asks *what* the bodybuilders eat.  The passage explicitly states they eat **ɲɔgɔndan cogoya la** (bodybuilders). The ""ɲɔgɔndan cogoya la"" is used to refer to the bodybuilders themselves, because they are the ones who eat these things.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cogoya kura la** (bodybuilding protein) - While bodybuilders consume this, it's not what they *eat* in a broader sense.
* **B: Sanfɛ kalanso niwo la** (milk) - Milk is mentioned, but it's not the primary focus of what bodybuilders eat.
* **C: Olɛmpiki niwo la** (the Olympics) - The Olympics are where athletes win medals, but not what bodybuilders *eat*.

Here's why:

* **The text says:** ""Tamasiyɛn ɲuman ɲuman kɔnɔna dɔngɔnɔn kan be seka kɛ fura baraniw ye ani furaw bagama sɔrɔli ye.""  This translates to: ""Many, many people are going to the fire for the sake of the valuable treasures and the wealth that is in the bag.""
* **The question asks:** ""What is the reason why people are going to the fire?""
* **The text explicitly states the reason:**  It's for the ""valuable treasures and the wealth.""  These treasures and wealth are described as being ""kɔnɔdimi jugumanba ani kɔnɔdimi"" - which translates to ""riches and wealth"" or ""treasure and valuables"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fɔnɔnege ni farigan** - ""Fire and smoke"" - While there's fire, it's not the reason *why* people are going.
* **B: Fɔnɔ ni wɔsili** - ""Fire that burns"" - Again, focuses on the fire itself, not the motivating factor.
* **D: Furakisɛ buteli furasɛbɛn** - ""A flask with a fire"" - This is irrelevant to the question.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a gas station that has a mechanic who is good at fixing cars.**  It specifically mentions the mechanic is skilled at ""cogoya jateminɛ waatimina i be gɛr'ala ani dirapo wilema suguw sugu,"" which translates to something like ""working with engines, fixing them quickly and with care."" 
* **The question asks what kind of mechanic is being described.**
* **Option C (""Binkɛra min kan k'o cogola lajɛ"" - Mechanics who can fix engines) directly reflects the description in the passage.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka yɔrɔ jateminɛ (Engineers):** While a mechanic might have some engineering knowledge, the passage focuses on the practical repair skills, not theoretical engineering.
* **B: Binkɛra min kan ka gɛrɛ o la (Mechanics who are good at selling):** The passage focuses on *fixing* cars, not *selling* them.
* **D: Ka dɛmɛ kɔnɔ (People who are tired):** This is completely unrelated to the description of the mechanic.

"Ninnu kumasen jumɛn de tɛ ye, bin kɛra min kan k'o lajɛ cogo baaraw jira ka ɲɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Ka lajɛ ka jateminɛ kɛ dirapo bilema suguw sugu la**

Here's why:

* **P asks:**  The passage describes a workshop where things are being made with wood, nails, and very long screws. It asks what kind of work is being done there.

* **Q asks:**  What kind of work is being done?

* **A:**  ""Jɔrɔbaliya n'i yɛrɛ joginni ye"" (It's a carpentry workshop). While related, it doesn't directly address the *specific* work being done.

* **B:** ""Ka yɔrɔ sɛgɛsɛgɛ ka kɔn bin kɛra min kan ɲɛ"" (It's about the things that were made). This is a description of the result, not the process.

* **C:** ""Bin kɛra min kan ko cogoya la"" (It's about things that are made of wood).  This is a material, not the activity.

* **D:** ""Ka lajɛ ka jateminɛ kɛ dirapo bilema suguw sugu la"" (Making things with wood, nails, and very long screws). This directly describes the *process* being happening in the workshop as stated in the passage. It's the most accurate answer to what kind of work is being done.



Therefore, option D is the most logical and direct answer to the question.

* The text states that ""Faransi Yɛlɛma fɛnɛ ye jamana wɛrɛw mɔgɔdegunnenw caman sɔn hakili la ka yɛlɛmaw dadon u yɛrɛ fɛ yen"" which translates to ""The French Republic is a democratic nation based on the respect for human rights and dignity"".
* This implies that a core function of the government (Faransi Yɛlɛma) is to ensure and protect citizens' rights and dignity.
* Option B directly reflects this core function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jamana ka farankan dɛmɛ** (The French government is old) - This is irrelevant to the question about their responsibility.
* **C: Tilannifanga hakilinaw tali** (The upholding of laws) - While upholding laws is important, the text emphasizes *respect for human rights and dignity* which is broader than just law enforcement.
* **D: Hakɛjatelan jura** (Judicial power) - Judicial power is one component of a functioning state, but the question is about the government's overall responsibility regarding citizens' rights.

* **The passage states:** ""O kelen kɛra kɛlɛcɛw la bawo sani jalasɔrɔ ka kɛ jɛɲɔgɔnyako ye a kɛra o waati seko ani dɔnko mugudala ye."" This translates to: ""The state power, in seeking to maintain its authority, resorts to **journalists** and its allies to use the means of power, of speed and wealth.""

* **The question asks:** ""What are the means by which the French state uses journalists and its allies to maintain its authority?""

* **""Jɛɲɔgɔnyako""** means ""journalists.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sansɔrɔ** means ""censorship."" While censorship might be *used* in conjunction with journalists, the passage doesn't directly state it as the primary *means* they employ.
* **C: Ɲɛtaa ɲinini** means ""false news"" or ""lies."" While journalists *could* spread lies, the passage focuses on their role in *maintaining authority* using various *means*.
* **D: Seko ni dɔnko** means ""speed and wealth."" While speed and wealth are mentioned as tools the state uses, they are *used through* entities like journalists, not as the primary entities themselves.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Muna tiransipɔritasiyɔn cogoya siraw be damagasiw natai, muna u tɛ sɔn dɔngɔndɔ?"" which translates to ""In damaged freight transport, what is the cause?""

* **The text states:** ""Jamana minunw taleno ɲɛ kɔnɔ, a ka gɛlɛ i ka nin damagasiw suguw mɛ ji kalite kuna walima pɔnw beni duguma kuna."" which translates to ""The main cause is the use of low-quality packaging and poor handling.""

* **Option C, ""Foroba tiransipɔri,"" refers to freight transport.** This is the context in which the damaged goods are being transported.  The problem isn't just transport in general, but *freight* transport. The answer highlights a problem within the freight transport system itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ji kalite (Good quality):** The text states the *opposite* – low quality is the problem.
* **B: Pɔn dilanni (Wooden planks):** While wooden planks *could* be part of packaging, the text is more focused on *overall* packaging quality, not just one material.
* **D: Kalan (Stone/Rock):**  This is irrelevant to the discussion of transport and packaging.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de be se ka fɔ foroba tiransipɔri kan?","The correct answer is **C: U ye u la baara bagaw bila ka damakasi caman kɛ**

Here's why:

The passage describes a problem: transportation vehicles are damaged by cargo. It asks about the causes of this damage and how to prevent it. Option C directly addresses the root cause of the problem: *the cargo itself* is causing the damage because it is fragile.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U kanunen ka ɲɛ u ta baga bɛɛ fɛ** (It is because the cargo is heavy): The passage mentions the cargo is *fragile*, not necessarily heavy.
*   **B: U tiɲɛnen do ka tɛmɛ ji kalite kan** (It is because the material is of poor quality): While poor quality material might contribute, the primary issue is the fragility of the cargo itself.
*   **D: U ye fu ye jamana yiriwalen cama na** (It is because of the way the vehicles are driven): The passage mentions the drivers might be driving poorly to cause damage, but this is not the root cause of the problem. The cargo is the fragile one.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the passage.

Here's why:

The text states that a major reason for the high cost of mobile phones (100% of the cost) is the **cost of the components (sirakunana baaraw)**.  The text explicitly mentions that the components (battery, screen, and processor) make up a significant portion of the total price. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sirikilasiyɔn teliya (Technology/Engineering):** While technology is involved, the text doesn't highlight it as the *main* reason for the high cost.
*   **B: Sirakunana labɛnni (Components/Parts):** This is too general. The text specifies *which* components (battery, screen, processor) are expensive.
*   **D: Sirikilasiyɔn Bolili (Production/Manufacturing):** While manufacturing costs are a factor, the text prioritizes the cost of the components as the main driver of the price.

The passage states that Hershey and Chase used radioactive phosphorus to track the genetic material.  They observed that the phosphorus ended up in the nucleus of the bacteria, supporting the idea that DNA, which contains phosphorus, is the genetic material.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jɔlan fɛn (Sulfur)**: The passage mentions sulfur as being present in proteins, but it was *phosphorus* that was used in the experiment.
* **C: Silifiri farima (Silicone)**:  Silicone is not mentioned in the context of the Hershey-Chase experiment.
* **D: Banakisɛw (Bacteriophages)**: While bacteriophages were the viruses used in the experiment, the question asks *what they used to identify the genetic material*.

* **The question asks:** ""What is the chemical in kola nuts?""
* **Option D** directly reflects this statement by saying the chemical is a type of chemical compound.  The other options are incorrect because:
    * A:  ""Ni farikolobɔn ye bɔlen ani bugulen ye"" (Chemicals are natural or synthetic) - This is too broad.
    * B: ""Jɔlan fɛn nafaw"" (Human beings/People) -  Irrelevant.
    * C: ""Yɛlɛmali cogoya"" (Kola nuts) -  This is what the chemical *is found in*, not *what it is*.

"Ka da kunafoni dilenw kan tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, yɛlɛma nɔ suguyaw tɛ u jigi da mun kan?","The correct answer is **B: Ni Nɔ bilala bɔn dɔ bɔlen ani bugulen ye**.

Here's why:

* **P states:**  Yellémali (a certain substance) is found in both naturally occurring and manufactured food. Consuming it can lead to health problems like cancer.
* **Q asks:** What happens when kunafoni (a type of pastry) is cooked? Does the yellémali disappear?

The answer needs to address whether cooking removes the harmful yellémali. Option B directly states that yellémali *does not* disappear when cooked, but remains in both natural and processed foods. This aligns with the information in P.  The other options are incorrect because they don't address the presence or absence of yellémali after cooking.

Let's break down why the other options are wrong:

* **A: Nɔ bilala jɔlan fɛn hakɛ joli la (It doesn't disappear during the process):** This is a restatement of the core information from P, but doesn't directly answer the question of what happens *during* cooking of kunafoni.
* **C: Nɔbilala jɔlan fɛ min na o nafa (It disappears during the process):** This directly contradicts the information in P, which states yellémali is present in both natural and manufactured foods.
* **D: Nɔbilala yɛlɛmamin na o cogoya (It disappears during the process):** Incorrectly suggests yellémali disappears during cooking.



Therefore, option **B** is the only logically sound and supported answer.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de tun tɛ kun ye walasa tabolow ka baa mara?,"The correct answer is **D: U tun b’a to u bɛ nɔnɔ sɔrɔ** (They were looking for honey).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bakurubala, bakɔlɔni maralen kun maralen dɔ kuluw cɛra minunw kun be yala kuluw la walima biman yɔrɔ wɛɛrɛw la, waatidɔw la kun be gɛn bagangɛnanw fɛ minunw kun ya waaticama denmisɛniw walima cɛmisɛniw, minw kasurun bagangɛnan kodɔnlen na. Nin bagan gɛn fɛrɛw beka nati ali bibi in na.""

This translates to: ""...the colonists, in search of a new land, were looking for honey, herbs, and other valuable plants, which provided food for their animals and sustenance for themselves, and they used these plants for medicine and for various other purposes.  This was the reason for their arrival.""

Therefore, the colonists were looking for honey as one of the things they searched for when seeking a new land.



"
Gɔlifu kun ye ka mun hakɛ dɔgɔmani taa?,"The correct answer is **A: Balɔnw**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Goliath as a giant who used a club to hit people and throw large balls. The question asks what Goliath used to hit people. The passage explicitly states he used a ""balɔn bugɔ"" which translates to ""large ball"" or ""big ball.""  The answer options refer to:

*   **B: Bɔni** -  Means ""fight"" or ""struggle"".
*   **C: Waati** - Means ""water"".
*   **D: Woni** - Means ""people"".

Therefore, ""Balɔnw"" (large ball) is the only option that aligns with what the passage describes Goliath using."
"Gɔlifu tɛrɛnkan, yɔrɔ jumɛn bin tigɛlendo k’a surunya?","The correct answer is **C: Woni fɔlɔ** (Their feet).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gɔlifu ye farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ je min n'a zuyebaw be jiri fɛrɛn do labaara ka balɔn bugɔ ka dɔn wɔni kɔnɔ."" (Golifu is a strong man whose legs he used to jump over a high wall to reach the other side.)

Then, it says: ""Zuye fan fɔlɔ be kɛ wɔni tanisegin la, nin zuyekɛraw daminɛli ye waatibɛla wɔni fɔlɔla ani taleɲɛ ba laban wɔni taniseginanla."" (His legs were strong, and his power allowed him to jump over the wall and run to the other side.)

Finally, it describes what happened after the jump: ""Zuwekɛra min bɔni fitini kɛ, walima jirifɛrɛ yɛlɛma yɛlɛma dafa ka turu sebaya sɔrɔ. Zuwe be kɛ bin sanfɛ ani bin min be wɔni da gɛrɛfɛ tigɛlen kokɛ fitini ani be wele green."" (His enemies were afraid, and they ran away in all directions. Golifu was quick and ran toward the wall as fast as he could.)

The question asks: ""Golifu tɛrɛnkan, yɔrɔ jumɛn bin tigɛlendo k’a surunya?"" (Golifu's legs, what did they do at that time?)  The text indicates his legs were used to jump *over* the wall. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that his legs were used to jump. ""Woni fɔlɔ"" translates to ""their legs"" and is the correct answer.



"
Jumɛn ye sɛgɛsɛgɛli kun ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka hakilina kelen walima caman dɛn kɛrɛfɛ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the characteristics of a ""sɛgɛsɛgɛli"" (a type of plant).**  It mentions its leaves, stems, flowers, and how it grows.
* **The question asks ""What are the leaves of the plant?""**  (Jumɛn ye sɛgɛsɛgɛli kun ye?)
* **Option A, ""Ka hakilina kelen walima caman dɛn kɛrɛfɛ"" translates to ""The leaves are [like] small, white [things] that [are] fragrant.""** This directly answers the question about the leaves' appearance and a key characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: K’a faamu diɲɛ bɛ cogo min na** - ""What kind of food does it contain?"" This is about the plant's nutritional value, not its leaves.
* **C: Ka ɲininkali kɛ** - ""The stems are [like]..."" This is about the stems, not the leaves.
* **D: Ka dɔni ɲinini bila sira** - ""The flowers are [like] [something] that [is] fragrant."" This is about the flowers, not the leaves.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately describes the leaves based on the provided passage."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tɛ dɛmɛlikɛ ka dɔni ɲinini bila sira?","The correct answer is **C: Hakilina minnu bɛ se ka sɔrɔ k’olu dɛn gɛrɛfɛ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...hakilina kelen walima fila den gɛrɛfɛ, ɲininkaliw kɛli ani lajɛliw kɛli be dɔni ɲɛɲininli nɛfɛ."" This translates to ""...the benefits of the benefit of the forest, the health of the people and the well-being of the community are all achieved through the forest's richness.""

* **The question asks:** ""What is the reason why the forest is important?""

* **Option C** (""Hakilina minnu bɛ se ka sɔrɔ k’olu dɛn gɛrɛfɛ"" - The health of the people and the well-being of the community are achieved through the forest) directly reflects the purpose and importance of the forest as described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dɔniya fɛrɛw dɔrɔn** (Forest richness) - While the forest *is* rich, this doesn't explain *why* that richness is important.
* **B: Ka jateminɛw kɛ** (It is a place of gathering) - The passage mentions gatherings, but this isn't the primary reason for the forest's importance.
* **D: Ka sɛgɛsɛgɛliw kɛ** (It is a place of food) - The passage mentions food, but it's presented as *one* of many benefits, not the *main* reason for the forest's importance.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the given passage.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn de tɛ tiɲɛ ye fiyɛnkolonw kan?","The correct answer is **A: Fiyɛnkolonw bɛ se ka fɛn bɛɛ tiɲɛ u kɛrɛfɛ** (Trains are very useful for transporting goods and people).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fiyɛnkolɔɔn be jirijuw bɔn, a be sojanw jirifɛrɛnw ta kabɔ u kuna, ani ka mɔbiliw ta k'u fili sanfɛ."" (Trains are very useful, they carry goods and people from one place to another.)

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Fiyɛnkolonw bɛ yɔrɔ fitininw gosi ka tɛmɛ fununfunun tɔw kan** (Trains are a very large and fast mode of transport). While trains *can* be fast, the passage doesn't emphasize speed as the primary reason for their usefulness.
* **C: Fiyɛnkolon caman bɛ tɛmɛ lɛri saba kan** (Trains can travel at a speed of 100 km/h). This is a specific speed mentioned in the passage, but it doesn't address the overall usefulness.
* **D: Fiyɛnkolon dɔw be se ka fiyɛn fili fo mayili (miles) 300 lɛri kɔnɔ** (Trains can travel a distance of 300 miles). This is a specific distance mentioned, but again, doesn't directly address their usefulness.



Therefore, option A best summarizes the main point of the passage regarding the usefulness of trains."
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, kumasen jumɛn de bɛ ɲɛfɔlikɛ fiyɛnkolon kan ka ɲɛ?","The correct answer is **B: U bɛ fiyɛn dilan ka se 480 mayili (miles) ma lɛri kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nin subaga fiyɛnkolɔn be fiyɛnw fili min be kimomɛtiri 480 lɛrɛ kɔnɔ (133 mɛtiri/sekɔndi kɔnɔ; 300 mph)."" This translates to: ""The train can travel a distance of 480 kilometers in an hour (133 meters per second; 300 mph).""

Therefore, the question asks how far the train can travel in an hour, and the text directly answers that it can travel 480 kilometers (or 480 miles).
"
Adamadenw ye ninnu jumɛn de kɛli daminɛ san kɛmɛ sigi 16nan?,"The correct answer is **C: Lunɛtiw dilanni** (Telescopes of that time).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What were the people of that time using to observe the stars?""
* **The passage states:** ""Telesikɔpu fɔlɔ tiɲɛ tiɲɛ dilana Erɔpu sikɛli 16 na labana."" (Telescopes were first invented in Europe in the 16th century.)
* **Therefore:** The people were using telescopes to observe the stars. The phrase ""dilanni"" refers to ""of that time,"" referring to telescopes from the 16th century.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lunɛtiw labaarali** (Early telescopes): While accurate that they were early, the question isn't specifically about the *early* telescopes, but what they were *using* to observe.
* **B: Fɛnw bonyali** (Simple lenses):  The passage states telescopes were used. While telescopes utilize lenses, just saying ""simple lenses"" isn't specific enough to the tool used for observing stars.
* **D: Telesikɔpu dilanni** (Telescopes of that time): This is a rephrasing of the correct answer, but option C is the more concise and natural way to express the answer.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and complete answer.
"
Kabi waati joli adamadenw bɛ fɛnw bonya ni lunɛtiw ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Kabinin kɛmɛ sigi 16nan daminɛ** (The 16th century).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Telesikɔpu fɔlɔ tiɲɛ tiɲɛ dilana Erɔpu sikɛli 16 na labana."" (Telescopes first appeared in Europe in the 16th century.)
* **The question asks:** ""Kabi waati joli adamadenw bɛ fɛnw bonya ni lunɛtiw ye?"" (When did people begin to use telescopes?)
* **Option D directly answers this question** by stating the 16th century.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: San bakelen** (Later) - The passage explicitly states the 16th century.
* **B: Kabini kɛmɛ sigi 16nan laban** (The 16th century) - This is the same as D, but the phrasing ""laban"" (the 16th) is less natural in this context than ""daminɛ"" (century). However, it is factually correct.
* **C: San ba caman** (Long ago) - This is too vague and doesn't provide a specific time frame.



Therefore, **D: Kabinin kɛmɛ sigi 16nan daminɛ** is the most accurate and complete answer.

"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, Muhamadu ka kuluwo bɛ mun fɔ kelennadeliw an’u nafaw kan?","The correct answer is **C: A tun mako bɛ waati fitinin dɔrɔn walasa ka to a kelen na.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Kulu la ka a lajɛ. Kuluwo in yɛrɛ, min ye waatijan kɛ, ye taamasiɲɛɲumanba di Muhammad ka kelennadeliw ma."" (The community grew and it was a small community, and Muhammad became their leader.)
* **The question asks:** ""Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, Muhamadu ka kuluwo bɛ mun fɔ kelennadeliw an’u nafaw kan?"" (Over time, how did Muhammad become a leader for the community?)
* **Option C translates to:** ""He worked as a merchant and was known for his honesty, and he became their leader."" This directly aligns with the passage describing Muhammad's role and how he gained leadership.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A bɛ nafa di hɛrɛ ni kelenna toli ma** (He began to pray and worship alone.) While prayer was important, the passage doesn't say *this* is how he became a leader of the community.
* **B: Kɛnɛma mankanw bɛ dɛmɛli kɛ miiri la** (The people were scattered in a small area.) This describes the initial state of the community, not how Muhammad became a leader.
* **D: A tun mako bɛ waati fitinin dɔrɔn walasa ka to a kelen na** (He became a strong warrior and took control of his leadership.) The passage doesn't describe Muhammad as a warrior."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nɛgɛ tun bɛ kɛ mun de ye fɔlɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Siratugulan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Siratugulan nana jɔna walaka ka siraw bil'u nɔna ka to."" This translates to ""The invention of the bicycle was a great success.""  The question asks what was a great success.

Therefore, the answer is ""Siratugulan"" (invention of the bicycle).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, munna jiri senw falenna ka kɛ nɛgɛ senw ye?","The correct answer is **A: U ye dɔfara sow ka teliya kan** (It was a difficult task to make the wheels turn).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O kɛra waleya carilen ye, nka nege be cɛni cama kɛ wagɔn jiri senw na. Waati jateminɛla, jiri senw falen na nin nɛgɛ senw ye."" This translates to: ""It was a difficult task to make the wheels turn, so they had to use a lot of force to move them. Later, the wheels would turn with a bit of force.""

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the difficulty involved in the early tire design and the need for significant effort to get the wheels rotating.  The other options don't align with the passage's description of the challenges.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de ye mɔgɔw labɛn Romantizimu waati la?","The correct answer is **B: Sigiyɔrɔ**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Who were the people associated with Romanticism?""
* **The passage states:** ""Romantizimu hokumu kɔnɔ, sigiyɔrɔ ye mɔgɔw labɛn ani ni waati tɛmɛni ye..."" which translates to ""Romanticism flourished, and the people associated with it were women and men who lived during that time...""
* **Therefore, ""sigiyɔrɔ"" (women) is a correct answer.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sariyaw (flowers):** Flowers are not directly associated with the people who *created* Romanticism.
* **C: Laadaw (books):** Books were a medium used during Romanticism, but not the people themselves.
* **D: Kokɔrɔw (birds):** Birds are mentioned as a symbol in Romanticism (freedom, nature), but not as the people who *were* Romantic.



"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn de tɛ jirali kɛ fɛɛrɛsiraw detɛrimizimu hakilinala bakurunba la? ,"The question is in a language that is not easily recognizable. It seems to be a garbled attempt at a question related to determinism and free will.  Without knowing the language, it's impossible to accurately translate the question and therefore impossible to choose the correct answer.

**However, based on the context of the provided text (which discusses the interplay of physics, human perception, and predictability), the answer most likely refers to a philosophical position on free will.**  The question asks about the compatibility of determinism (the idea that all events are predetermined) with free will (the idea that we have genuine choice).

Given the options, and assuming the question asks about the compatibility, the best *guess* (again, relying on context and the probable intent) would be:

**C: Fɛɛrɛsiraw bɛ fɛn kɛ sigida mɔgɔw la**

This translates to something like: ""Determinism can be seen as a limitation of the scope."" This option hints at the idea that determinism, while perhaps accurate in its description of how the universe *works*, doesn't necessarily negate the experience of freedom or choice within that scope.

**Important Note:** This is purely an educated guess.  Without understanding the language, a definitive answer is impossible.  The question is fundamentally unanswerable in its current form.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de jɛlen tɛ nɛgɛjurunin sama fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Mankan fɛgɛnman**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sanfɛ nɛgɛkuruni bɛ mankanfɛgɛnman di..."" which translates to ""The character of the Sanfɛ Nɛgɛkuruni is [one of] endurance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mariki dɔ be i ko sɛbɛnfuranɔrɔlan:** This refers to the strength of the people, not the character of the Sanfɛ Nɛgɛkuruni.
* **C: Mankan girinman:** This means ""endurance of green,"" which doesn't fit the context of the character being described.
* **D: Daminɛli kanba la:** This refers to being very careful or cautious, not the primary character trait mentioned.

Therefore, **Mankan fɛgɛnman (endurance)** is the correct answer because it directly reflects the character trait attributed to the Sanfɛ Nɛgɛkuruni in the passage."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn lajɛnnen do ni mankan fitini ye?","The correct answer is **D: K’a daminɛ i tɛgɛ bɛ nɛgɛkurunin minɛ yɔrɔmin na**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Which of these is the cause of the great problems?"" (translated)
* **The text states:** ""Sanfɛ nɛgɛkuruni bɛ mankanfɛgɛnman di, dugumanɛgɛkuruni ka girinman ani a bɛ mɔgɔ don.""  This translates to: ""The cause of the Sanfɛ Nɛgɛkuruni is great problems, and the dugumanɛgɛkuruni is the cause of sickness and death.""
* **Option D directly reflects this:** ""K’a daminɛ i tɛgɛ bɛ nɛgɛkurunin minɛ yɔrɔmin na"" translates to ""The very cause of the Nɛgɛkurunin minɛ yɔrɔmin na."" The ""minɛ yɔrɔmin na"" refers to the Sanfɛ Nɛgɛkuruni, which is explicitly identified as the cause of the great problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Duguma nɛgɛkuruni (Sickness Nɛgɛkuruni):** While sickness is a consequence, the text identifies the Sanfɛ Nɛgɛkuruni as the *cause* of the problems, and the dugumanɛgɛkuruni as the cause of sickness.
* **B: Nɛgɛkuruni samali (Small Nɛgɛkuruni):** The text doesn't mention ""samali"" (small).
* **C: Nɛgɛkuruni min bɛ i ko V (Nɛgɛkuruni that is from V):** The text refers to ""Nɛgɛkuruni min ye ko V"" but does not identify it as the cause of the problems.

Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately identifies the cause of the great problems as described in the text."
Sukɔrɔw b’a jira an ko tɛgɛ laban k’a bɛrɛbɛn ni ninnu jumɛn de labaarali ye fɔlɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Yɛlɛmalima** (children).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sukɔrɔ tigɛkolo, san miliyɔn filia ka se saba ma kɔrɔya, be nin yɛlɛma tigɛ baaraw la jira kabɔ tamala ka ta yɛlɛma yɛlɛmalima."" This translates to: ""The population is large, about six million people, and mostly consists of children, who are being raised by families and living in temporary shelters.""

Therefore, the question asks who primarily make up the population, and the answer is **children (yɛlɛmalima)**.

Ninnu jumɛn de bɛ woronin tɛgɛngɔni kolow ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ? ,"The correct answer is **A: U tilennen do ka tɛmɛ adamaden ta kan**.

Here's why:

The text describes the impact of the disease: it affects children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. It also mentions a high number of deaths. The question asks what the main consequence of the disease is.

Option A (""It causes death among people"") directly reflects the information in the text about the high mortality rate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U bolow n’u senw tɛ kelen ye bonya la** (""It causes the spread of the disease among the people"") - While the disease spreads, the text focuses more on the *effect* of the disease, which is death.
* **C: U bɛ doni ɲun de kɛ** (""It causes suffering"") - While suffering is likely, the text doesn't explicitly emphasize suffering as the primary consequence.  Death is more directly mentioned.
* **D: U ka baara dɔlɔ ye yɛlɛmayɛlɛmali kɛ** (""It causes financial difficulties"") - The text doesn't mention financial impacts.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text.



"
Sugandili jɔlan kura yɛlɛmali bɔ suguya jumɛnna?,"The correct answer is **D: Kɛnɛkanda**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Siyekili muganan ɲɛɲinli ya' jira ko suguya fila dɔrɔn de beyi: dogolen ani **kɛnɛkanta**."" This translates to: ""The most popular types of aromatic plants are used to make incense: frankincense or **myrrh**.""  The question asks what incense is made from.  Therefore, myrrh (kɛnɛkanda) is the answer.
"
Baara taa cogo jumɛn de bɛ dɔfara jɔlan yɛlɛmali kan?,"The correct answer is **C: Yɛlɛmali (coffee)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Siyekili muganan ɲɛɲinli ya' jira ko suguya fila dɔrɔn de beyi: dogolen ani kɛnɛkanta. Yɛlɛmali be farikolo dilan na yɛlɛmali kura farakan, ani sugandili b'a bɔ kɛnɛkantaw yɛlɛmali kulu cɛla.

This translates roughly to: ""The coffee beans are roasted and ground: roasted or unroasted. Coffee is a very popular drink, and its aroma is often associated with coffee.  The roasted and ground beans are used to make coffee, which is widely consumed across generations.""

The question asks what the people are gathering for (cogo jumɛn).  The passage describes people gathering around coffee, specifically for drinking and enjoying it. Therefore, the answer must be **Yɛlɛmali (coffee)**.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dɛnni gɛrɛfɛ (Roasted beans):** While roasted beans *are* used to make coffee, the passage is about the coffee itself, not just the beans.
* **B: Faraɲɔgɔnka (Ground coffee):**  Similar to roasted beans, ground coffee is a *form* of coffee, but the gathering is about the beverage.
* **D: Kɛnɛkanda (Unroasted beans):**  Again, unroasted beans are a component, but the gathering is focused on the coffee itself.

"Ka da kunnafoni dilen kan tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, gɔn kan ka ninnu jumɛn de dun walasa k’a ka “poroteniyi ko gɛlɛya” ɲɛnabɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Furabulu jalan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jiriw minunw sɔrɔkadi kosɛbɛ be kɛ puroteyiniw jiri furaburuw la ani nakɔkɔnɔ fɛnw la..."" which translates to ""The foods that we eat are made up of proteins from animals and plants...""

Then it explains that these proteins are broken down into amino acids, and some of these amino acids are essential proteins (""poretiyeni ko kunbalan"").  Therefore, ""furabulu jalan"" (animal protein) is a source of these essential proteins.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nakɔla fɛn kɛnɛw (Plant fats):** While plants contain proteins, the text emphasizes that *animal* proteins are essential proteins.  Plant fats are not the primary source of essential proteins mentioned.
* **C: Ntɔnw (Fish):** Fish is a type of animal protein, and therefore a source of essential proteins. However, ""furabulu jalan"" is a broader category encompassing all animal proteins, making it a more accurate answer.
* **D: Fulɛri kalaw (Fruits):** Fruits primarily contain carbohydrates and vitamins, not significant amounts of essential proteins.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kunbalan jumɛn de sabu ma bɔ amino-asidi nafamanw dɛsɛli la?","The correct answer is **C: Kɔrɔbayali gɛlɛya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kɔrɔbayali gɛlɛya, dumuni nafan ma dɔn ni baliya bana, ani laban laban na saya."" This translates to ""Cɔrɔbayali gɛlɛya, the proteins that are found in the meat, and the ones that are present in all the parts, and in all the parts they are found.""  The question asks which of the options are responsible for providing amino acids. The text explicitly links proteins in meat (""kɔrɔbayali gɛlɛya"") to amino acid provision.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dumuni yɛlɛma dakunw (The body's proteins):** While the body *does* have proteins, the text specifically highlights *meat proteins* (""kɔrɔbayali gɛlɛya"") as key providers of amino acids.
* **B: Balokojuguya (Vegetables):** The text mentions vegetables as containing proteins, but it emphasizes that meat proteins are more significant in this context.
* **D: Saya (All parts):** While the text says proteins are in all parts, it doesn't specify *which* part is the primary source of amino acids. Meat proteins are the strongest link to amino acids provided within the text.

This translates to: ""The table of discussions is used to explore the relationship between the source of information and the credibility of the information, whether it is credible, questionable, or whether it is questionable and credible.""

* **Option D directly reflects this:** ""Ni finidon cogo kɛli ye tamasiyɛn sugudɔ ye"" translates to ""The credibility is assessed and the reliability is evaluated.""  This captures the essence of determining whether information is credible or not, as discussed in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: N’a si filɛli ye k’u ɲagamin u la** (It is based on the opinion of the person.) - While opinion can play a role, the text focuses on *evaluating the credibility of the information itself*, not just the opinion of someone who presented it.
* **B: N’u kɛrɛfɛmɔgɔ bɛɛ ka danayaw tali ye** (It is based on the analysis of the expert.) - Similar to A, the text doesn't solely focus on expert analysis but on assessing the information's inherent credibility.
* **C: Ni jɛnniye ni sigida kɛwalew ye** (It is based on the authenticity of the source.) - Authenticity is a *part* of credibility, but not the *entire* assessment process. Credibility encompasses more than just source authenticity.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni hakilina jiralen in ye tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, mun de bɛ se ka denmisɛn na min b'a yɛrɛ jati siyakulu fitini dɔ fɛ min kofɔlen do k’u bɛ don bagabagali walew la?","The correct answer is **B: A ka c’a la o denmisɛn in bɛ se ka don bagabagali walew la**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks: ""If those who have been the victim of the great famine have experienced hardship, is it true that the people who have been victims of the great famine have also experienced hardship?""  This essentially asks if the groups are experiencing the same level of hardship.

* **The text (P)** describes how some people who have been victims of the famine are experiencing hardship (being unable to find food). It also states that those who have been victims of the famine are experiencing hunger and have lost their usual food sources.

* **Option B** directly reflects this.  ""A ka c’a la o denmisɛn in bɛ se ka don bagabagali walew la"" translates to ""It is possible that those who have been victims of the famine have also experienced hardship."" This aligns with the text mentioning hardship and loss of food, and it answers the question of whether the groups are experiencing the same level of hardship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O denmisɛn in b’a si filɛ k’a yɛrɛ tanga bagabagali walew donni ma** translates to ""Those who have been victims of the famine have not experienced hardship at all."" This contradicts the text which says they *are* experiencing hardship.

* **C: O denmisɛn in b’a yɛrɛ bɔsi jama dalajɛw la** translates to ""Those who have been victims of the famine have experienced great joy."" This is completely opposite of the text and the question.

* **D: O denmisɛn in b’a yɛrɛ bɔsi jama dalajɛw la ni siyakulu fitini tɔw ye** translates to ""Those who have been victims of the famine have experienced great joy or the great famine is over.""  This is not directly answering the question about hardship; it introduces the idea of the famine ending.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and logical response based on the given text and question."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, denmisɛn ka bɔli kow kalama minnu kofɔlen siya kan, a bɛ se ka yɛlɛma don ninnu jumɛn de la?","The correct answer is **C: U ka jɛɲɔngɔnya ni denmisɛn wɛrɛw ye** (It is a consequence of the fact that the denmisɛniw are the ones who are constantly seeking to imitate the elders).

Here's why:

* **The text explains:** Denmisɛniw (young people) imitate elders' actions, including their speech and behavior. This imitation is a driving force behind the development of their language.
* **The question asks:** What is the reason why the language of denmisɛniw is different from the language of elders?
* **Option C directly addresses this:** It states that the difference in language is *a consequence* of denmisɛniw constantly trying to emulate the elders.  Since they're imitating, their language will naturally evolve and differ from the original.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Siyakulu fitinin min n’a b’a yɛrɛ jati o fɛ (The elders' language is very old):** While elders speak a long-established language, the text doesn't focus on the *age* of the language as the primary reason for the difference. It emphasizes imitation.
* **B: U jogo (It is a game):** Language development isn't presented as a game in the text.  It's a serious process driven by imitation.
* **D: U siya faamu (It is a foreign language):**  The text clearly indicates it's not a foreign language but a variation arising from the imitation process within the community.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and logical response based on the provided text.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, a ka c’a la ninnu jumɛn de basigilen tɛ denmisɛn bagannamanw lamɔnina?","The correct answer is **D: Mɔgɔw ɲɛ n’u hakilina ɲɛ siranɲɛ**.

Here's why:

The text describes the ""bagan"" (garden) as a place where the denmisɛni (the person speaking/narrator) cultivates crops for food. It emphasizes the importance of the denmisɛni's effort and knowledge in tending to the garden and harvesting the produce. The final sentence states that the denmisɛni then prepares the food (and also serves it to the people).

Therefore, the denmisɛni is primarily a **farmer/cultivator** – someone who works the land to grow crops for sustenance and sharing with others. Option D, ""Mɔgɔw ɲɛ n’u hakilina ɲɛ siranɲɛ"" (farmer and provider), accurately captures this role.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka lamɔ a yɛrɛma** (It is a story of experience): While the text is a narrative, the core function described isn't just about sharing experience, but about the act of cultivation and provision.
* **B: Kumaɲɔgɔnya dɔnni ba** (A simple joke): The text is serious and descriptive, not humorous.
* **C: Kelenna to walew** (A song or poem): The text is prose, not poetic or lyrical.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de bɛ baganya jogow kofɔ ka ɲɛ denmisɛnna?","The correct answer is **C: Baganya jogo ka ca denmisɛnw na minnu tun bɛ datugu so bangebagaw fɛ**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""bagan"" as something that is done when a person is feeling sad or depressed (datugu so bangebagaw fɛ).  The passage specifically states that people ""baganya jogow"" (do a certain activity/game) to lift their spirits when they are in this state.  The game is designed to distract the person from their sadness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baganya jogow caman sababu bɔra lujura dɔ la** (Do a game for a certain reason): While there's a reason for playing, the core reason is to alleviate sadness, not just any reason.
*   **B: Baganya jogo bɛ se ka bɔ fo dɛngɛrɛfɛ la** (The game is about getting rid of sorrow):  The game *helps* to get rid of sorrow, but it's more about distraction and a change of focus, not a direct removal of sorrow itself.
*   **D: Baganya jogo bɛɛ bɔra nalomaya juguman de la** (The game is about a certain activity): This is too general. The text doesn't specify *what* the activity is, just *why* it's done.

"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, nin wale jumɛn de basigilen tɛ ni baloɲini sɛnɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Ka sinsin sɔrɔ caman kan n’o ye fɛɛrɛ ɲɛtaalenw fɔnkɔɲɔgɔn ye**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tariku la, sɛnɛkɛlaw fanba tunbe baloɲini sɛnɛ de kɛ wa hali sisan o kelen do ɲɛtaa jamana caman na.""  This translates to: ""Recently, scientists have been developing balloons made of a new material that is 100 times stronger than the material used for traditional balloons.""

* **The question asks:** ""Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, nin wale jumɛn de basigilen tɛ ni baloɲini sɛnɛ?"" This translates to: ""In the future, what will be the advantage of these new balloons?""

* **Option C states:** ""Ka sinsin sɔrɔ caman kan n’o ye fɛɛrɛ ɲɛtaalenw fɔnkɔɲɔgɔn ye"" which translates to: ""Because the material is a very strong and lightweight fabric.""  This directly addresses the advantage – being strong *and* lightweight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka sinsin sɔrɔ kan min bɛ sɛnɛkɛla ka denbaya makow ɲɛ** - This translates to ""Because the scientists who developed it need to study it further."" While study is necessary, it's not the *advantage* of the balloons themselves.
* **B: Ka dumuni dilan k’a feere tɔw ma** - This translates to ""Because it is cheaper to produce."" The passage doesn't mention cost.
* **D: Sumansiw sɔrɔli minnu ye sɛnɛkɛla ka yɔrɔ ta ye** - This translates to ""Because it is easy to transport.""  While easier transport might be a consequence of stronger balloons, it's not the primary advantage stated or implied.



Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately reflects the advantage of the new balloons based on the given passage.

Ninnu jumɛn de bɛ baloɲini sɛnɛ walew ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: A b’a to sɛnɛkɛkɛlaw bɛ se k’u ka sumansi yɛrɛkɛ o ka mara la.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Tariku la, sɛnɛkɛlaw fanba tunbe baloɲini sɛnɛ de kɛ wa hali sisan o kelen do ɲɛtaa jamana caman na."" (Recently, scientists have been creating balloons that are very similar to those used in the past.)
* **Option C accurately reflects this:** ""A b’a to sɛnɛkɛkɛlaw bɛ se k’u ka sumansi yɛrɛkɛ o ka mara la"" translates to ""It turns out that scientists have been experimenting with making them float."" This directly addresses the recent development of scientists working on these balloons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O ye cogo ye min bɛ danfɛnw dɔrɔn de kan** (It's a result of the research that people have done.) - While research is involved, the text specifically focuses on the scientists *creating* the balloons.
* **B: U bɛ fɛɛrɛw kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnenw labaara ka sɔrɔ bonya f’a dan** (They are made of very thin, transparent material and are released into the air.) - The text doesn't mention the material or the releasing of the balloons. It focuses on the creation by scientists.
* **D: Ali sisan u bɛ ka labaara sɛnɛkɛlaw fɛ jamana dɔw la** (Ali is the scientist who created the balloons in the past.) - The text doesn't mention a specific scientist named Ali or the past creation of these balloons. It talks about the *recent* work of *scientists* in general.



"
"Ka ta bɔ fɛnkɔrɔmaraso la, o bɛ jate turisimu suguya jumɛn fɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Yɛrɛɲɛba turisiw turisimu**.

Here's why:

The text describes tourism as something that involves traveling and experiencing different cultures and places for pleasure and relaxation. It mentions that tourists are people who travel for these reasons. Option B, ""Yɛrɛɲɛba turisiw turisimu"" (Tourist tourism), best captures this definition.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Baara turisimu** (Rural tourism): While rural tourism is a *type* of tourism, the text doesn't focus specifically on rural areas.
*   **C: Yɔrɔtabolodɔn turisimu** (Community-based tourism): Similar to rural tourism, this is a specific *type* but not the overarching definition provided.
*   **D: Kɛnɛma turisimu** (Adventure tourism): Adventure tourism is also a *type* and not the general definition.

Therefore, **Yɛrɛɲɛba turisiw turisimu** is the most accurate answer, as it directly refers to the people (tourists) who engage in tourism as described in the text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de bɛ se ka kɛ yɛrɛɲɛba dugutaalaw bolo kosɛbɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Ka u yɛrɛ don tabolow kɔnɔ kosɛbɛ**.

Here's why:

* **The text explains that tourists who want to learn about the history of a place will consult history books and timelines.** The question asks *where* people go to learn about history.
* **Option A directly reflects this information**, stating that people go to books and timelines.
* **Option B** is about safety, which is a separate concern.
* **Option C** is about the historical narrative itself, not where people go to find it.
* **Option D** is about the timeline, not where people go to learn about history.

Here's why:

The text describes how antiretroviral drugs (tabolo antirepirɛniya) have changed the lives of people with HIV/AIDS.  Specifically, it mentions that these drugs allow people to live longer, become healthier, and participate more fully in society, including attending church and having fulfilling relationships. The passage highlights the positive impact of these medications.

The question asks what made it possible for people with HIV/AIDS to live longer and participate fully in church?  Option A directly addresses this by stating that antiretroviral drugs made this possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka dɔnni sɔrɔ mɔgɔw kan mɔgɔ minnu ye nɔ bila jɛkulu ka tabolo la:** This option is too vague. While medications are involved, it doesn't specifically explain *how* they allow participation in church.
* **C: Jɛkulu tagali fangaw lakodɔnni:** This option is unrelated to the topic of HIV/AIDS medication and church participation.
* **D: Jɛkulu ka tariku faamuyali:** This option refers to a specific date and is not relevant to the general impact of antiretroviral drugs on the lives of people with HIV/AIDS.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ yɛrɛ ka tariku faamuya be se k’i dɛmɛ mun na?","The correct answer is **C: Ka yɔrɔ ko faamu sɔrɔ jɛkulu kɔnɔ** (They pray for the dead to rest in peace).

Here's why:

The text states: ""O yɔrɔ in na, mirilila kunu antirepirɛniya tabolo ani u folola taɲɛ minunw na be mɔgɔw dɛmɛ ka dayɛlɛ yɛlɛmaliye ani tabolo kuraw o yɔrɔ ɛgilizi la.

(They pray for the dead to rest in peace and the people use the church table and the other traditions of the church. Their prayer on that day is a prayer for the dead to rest in peace, and the church table is used for the celebration of these prayers.)

The question asks what the people pray for on that day. The text explicitly says they pray for the dead to rest in peace. Option C reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka dɔ bɔ yɛlɛma ɲɛ siranɲɛ na** (They are looking for the deceased). While related to the deceased, it doesn't capture the prayer aspect.
* **B: Ka fanga di nafaw ma** (They are looking for a solution). This is completely unrelated to the text.
* **D: Ka antirepirɛniya tabolo fisaya** (They are praying for the church table).  The text mentions praying *with* the table, but not *for* the table itself.

Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately reflects the text's meaning.

Ninnu kumasen jumɛn de bɛ posimodɛrini mɔgɔw ka kalanfɛrɛ ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Kalan kɛ cogo dɔw ka fisa nin dɔw ye**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes postmodern individuals as being characterized by a fluid and ever-changing sense of self.**  They adopt various masks and personas (""fɛn kelen dɔrɔn teyi ka kalan""). This aligns with the idea that they ""fisa nin dɔw ye"" (mimic/imitate others/roles).

* **Option A (""Kalan kɛcogo dɔw nafa ka bon ni dɔw tɔw ye"" -  ""Color is a dynamic essence that is always changing"")** is too general. While the passage mentions change, it focuses on the *mimicry* aspect, not just change itself.

* **Option B (""Kalan kan ka sinsin fɛnw kan an dalen b’a la k’an bɛna minnu kɛ"" - ""Color can be a new mask that is worn by the person"")** is partially correct but doesn't fully capture the core idea of adopting *multiple* masks.

* **Option D (""Fɛnw tɛ kalan na minnu ye kelen ye fan bɛɛ walima minnu tɛ yɛlɛma"" - ""Masks and color are the person's essence and are also temporary depending on the situation"")** is also partially correct but doesn't emphasize the mimetic/imitative aspect as strongly as option C.

Therefore, option C most accurately reflects the passage's description of postmodern individuals adopting different personas and mimicking others.

Here's why:

The text describes how modern people use mobile phones to take pictures. It mentions various features of phone cameras and how they've replaced traditional cameras. Option A directly reflects this central idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dɔnni cogoyadɔw k’an ka bila dɔw sanfɛ** (Pictures can be shared easily). While true, this is a consequence of taking pictures, not the primary reason people take them in the modern era, according to the text.
* **C: Kalan cogoya sɛmɛnen do kalanden ani dɔnni jiralen** (Mobile phone cameras are better than traditional cameras). The text *implies* this by saying mobile phones have replaced traditional cameras, but it doesn't state this as a fact.
* **D: Ali dɔnni min n’a be se ka kɛ an tɛ baara k’a la o kan ka kalan** (All pictures taken are stored in the cloud).  The text doesn't mention cloud storage as a standard feature.

"Dabɔnkama kunuli sugunɔgɔ nɔrɔmali waatikɔnɔ, ninnu jumɛn de sen be don sugunɔgɔ tigɛli baaraw la?","The correct answer is **C: Ka alarimu faga i ka tabalikan ani ka segin ka sunɔgɔ miniti mugan kofɛ.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the regular oscillation of a pendulum slows down gradually. This slowing down is due to friction (air resistance and friction at the pivot point). The pendulum's swing gradually decreases in amplitude (height) over time. This is directly linked to the time it takes for the pendulum to complete each swing.

Option C accurately describes this:  ""The pendulum's swing decreases and its period (the time for one complete swing) increases with each swing."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka kalan kɛ lɛri kelen ani miniti bisaba sani i ka segin ka sunɔgɔ la** (It depends on the length of the string and the angle at which it is set, it is related to the oscillation of the pendulum): While string length does affect the period, this doesn't explain the *gradual slowing down* of the oscillations.
* **B: Ka taa ɲɛgɛnna ani ka segin ka taa dilankan o nɔgonni fɛ** (It depends on the density of the medium and is related to the oscillation of the pendulum): The density of the medium (air) *does* affect the damping (how quickly the pendulum slows down), but the passage doesn't focus on this.  The question asks about the *regular oscillation* and how it *slows down*.
* **D: Ka kunun ka ji min buteli la i ka tabalikan** (It depends on the shape of the pendulum bob and is related to the oscillation of the pendulum): The shape of the pendulum bob has a minor impact, but it's not the primary factor in the gradual slowing down.

* **The text states:** ""Cogoya wɛrɛw dɔgɔn dɔn tabolola bɛ seka kɛ ji man fɛnw cama miliye (kɛrɛenkɛrɛniyala ji walima te, sugunɛ cayala dɔnlen dɔ) yan'i ka sunɔgɔn, min be karaba ka wili ka sugunɛ kɛ.""  This translates to: ""Scientists have calculated that there are hundreds of billions (approximately 200 billion, or more) of galaxies, and each galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars, which are capable of having planets.""

* **Option D aligns with this calculation.** It directly refers to the estimated number of stars within galaxies, which is the basis for the overall estimate of the number of stars in the universe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A be se ka da dɔgɔn dɔn tabolokan:**  ""It's said that scientists have calculated..."" While scientists *have* calculated, the option doesn't specify *what* they calculated.
* **B: A kun de y’i kan’i yɛrɛ pewu:** ""It's that the universe is constantly expanding...""  The text doesn't mention the expansion of the universe.
* **C: A baara bɛ kɛ i ka sunɔgɔ nɔrɔmali waati la:** ""It's that the normal matter in it is...""  The text discusses stars and planets, not the composition of matter.



Therefore, option D is the only one that accurately reflects the information provided in the text about the estimated number of stars in galaxies.

Here's why:

The passage describes a phenomenon where the skin loses its elasticity with age. It mentions that this loss is due to a decrease in collagen and elastin, which are proteins responsible for skin's firmness and resilience. The passage also states that aging skin becomes more prone to wrinkles.

Option D, ""Waati janya ɲɛtugu ka dayɛlɛ telimanw ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ"" translates to ""Water and elasticity of the skin and firmness"". This option accurately reflects the core issue discussed in the passage: the loss of skin elasticity and firmness due to aging.  The other options are either too specific or don't fully capture the scope of the problem described.
"

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""How does the phenomenon of being unable to sleep affect the body?"" (translated)
* **The text states:** ""Nin nɛtugu ka dayɛlɛw dama damani ɲɔgɔn cɛ su kɔnɔ, nin cogoya in i be sunɔgɔ kɛ ani i faikolo be yɛrɛ sɔrɔ bɛ dɔgɔya kosɛbɛ f'a be kɛ kunbalan ye."" (translated) This translates to: ""The phenomenon of being unable to sleep affects the body and causes the body to become tired, and the body's energy is depleted, and it becomes weak.""

* **Option A:** ""Ɲɛtugu ka dayɛlɛ teliman cogoyaw dɔgɔyali"" translates to ""The body becomes tired.""  This is a direct consequence of sleep deprivation described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Option B:** ""Ɲɛtugu ka dayɛlɛ teliman dɔgɔyali sufɛ"" translates to ""The body becomes weak."" While weakness is mentioned, the text primarily focuses on tiredness and depletion of energy.
* **Option C:** ""Sirili jɔlen sunɔgɔ la"" translates to ""The body's energy."" This is not a direct answer to *how* the phenomenon affects the body; it's just stating what gets depleted.
* **Option D:** ""Ɲɛtugu ka dayɛlɛ teliman caya sufɛ"" translates to ""The body becomes weak.""  Similar to option B, weakness is a consequence, not the primary impact discussed.



Therefore, option A is the best and most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kulu kɛnɛkantaw ni ɛntɛrɛnɛti sanfɛ kuluw bɔlen do mun ni mun na?","The correct answer is **B: Kulu fila bɛɛ ka waati hakɛ bɛ yɛlɛma u ka don o don baaraw la.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the internet has become a powerful tool (""kuluw be mara nin ni baaraɲumankɛli sariya kelenw ne ye inafɔ kulu kɛnɛkantaw"").  It then describes how the internet is used to create content and how this content can spread quickly.  The passage also defines ""kulu yebali"" (power/influence) as the ability to make things happen.

Option B best reflects this idea by saying that ""Kulu fila bɛɛ ka waati hakɛ bɛ yɛlɛma u ka don o don baaraw la"" which translates to ""Power/influence is the ability to make things happen and to influence people."" This aligns with the internet's power to spread information and influence opinions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sigi kɛlen do n’a ye kulu fila bɛɛ ka baara kɛ hakɛ kelen na** (Power/influence is the ability to make things happen and to influence people). While close, this option is less specific.
* **C: Kulu fila bɛɛ bɛ ɲɛfɔlikɛ marabaga yebali ye** (Power/influence is a strong force of power). This is too general.
* **D: Kulu fila bɛɛ bɛ baara kɛ yɔrɔminnu lɛri ye kelen ye** (Power/influence is the ability to make things happen and to influence people). This is a restatement of option B.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

Here's why:

The text states that the internet is a platform for generating content and spreading rumors. It also defines ""online content"" as material created by users and shared online.  Therefore, the internet *allows* for the creation and sharing of content (including rumors).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ɛntɛrinɛti sanfɛ kuluw bɛ baara kɛ tumadɔw la inafɔ kɛnɛkan kuluw ka ɲɔgɔnsɔrɔyɔrɔ:** While rumors are spread, this option focuses *only* on rumors and ignores the broader range of content.
* **C: Kɛnɛkan kuluw waati ka dɔgɔn ka tɛmɛ ɛntɛrinɛti sanfɛ kuluw ta kan:** This option implies that content is *created* *by* the internet, which is inaccurate. Content is *created* *by users* *on* the internet.
* **D: Yɔrɔminnu tɛ lɛri kelen na, ɛntɛrinɛti sanfɛ kuluw be se k’olu nafa:** This option is too vague and doesn't directly address the relationship between the internet and the creation/sharing of content.

Ninnu jumɛn tɛ fɛn ye min b’a kɔnɔkow hakilinaw sinsinnen bɛ min kan?,"The correct answer is **A: Nege kura minnu bɛ na balikuya kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

The text discusses Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory. Both theories deal with *human needs and motivation*. The question asks what the ""needs"" are that are being discussed.

* **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs** is a theory proposing a hierarchy of human needs, starting with basic physiological needs and progressing to safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.  ""Nege kura minnu bɛ na balikuya kɔnɔ"" (basic needs are satisfied) directly aligns with the foundational level of Maslow's hierarchy.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Cogomin mɔgɔ sigiyɔrɔ nɔ b’a ka walew la** (People are not happy because they are not working). While work can contribute to happiness, it's not the core focus of either Maslow's or Herzberg's theories *as described in the text*. The text emphasizes needs, not specifically employment.
* **C: Mako minnu dumina kɔnɔ** (People are always motivated). This is overly broad and not specific to the theories discussed.  The theories focus on *what* motivates people, not that they are *always* motivated.
* **D: Mɔgɔw ka diyaɲɛw faamuyali** (People who are happy with their families). While family is important, it's more related to the ""love/belonging"" level of Maslow's hierarchy. The text's discussion is more generally about fundamental needs.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer because it directly refers to the basic needs that are the foundation of both Maslow's and Herzberg's theories.

* **Option C directly reflects this description:** ""Ka fɛn to yɔrɔ jɔnjɔn ɲuman dɔ la"" translates to ""It is known to be a place where various kinds of animals live.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Basigiyɔrɔ dɔ dilanni yɔrɔ minna fɛn be se ka bila yɔrɔminna** (The rain in the savanna is not enough for all kinds of plants to grow) - The passage doesn't say the rainfall is insufficient. It focuses on the presence of animals.
* **B: Ka ja in ɲɛnɛmaya ani k’a barika** (It is hot and dry) - While savannas *can* be hot and dry, the passage doesn't emphasize those characteristics.  It focuses on the animals.
* **D: Ka ja fɛnw bɛnɲɔgɔnya** (It is a place of very tall grass) - The passage doesn't mention tall grass being a defining characteristic. Savannas can have grasses, but it's not the main point being made.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ 35mm ja yangan ɲɛfɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: A bonya yɛlɛmali cogoya ka ca ni yanga tɔw caman ta ye baara bɛ kɛ minnu na** (It's about the digital camera's sensor size and the focal length that's appropriate for it).

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the equivalent focal length of a 35mm lens on a digital camera.** The passage explains that the focal length of a lens (35mm, 36mm, or 24mm) needs to be considered in relation to the camera's sensor size.
* **The passage mentions different sensor sizes:** 35mm, 36mm, 24mm, and APS-C. 
* **It states that a focal length appears different depending on the sensor size.**  A 35mm lens on a smaller sensor (like APS-C) will produce a narrower field of view compared to a 35mm lens on a full-frame sensor (36mm or 35mm).
* **Option C directly addresses this relationship:** It highlights that the equivalent focal length depends on the camera's sensor size and the crop factor (if applicable).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A bɛ ka dilan hali sisan** (It's about the lens's focal length).  While focal length is *part* of the question, it doesn't cover the *entire* issue – the relationship between focal length and sensor size.
* **B: A tara jatalan nimeriki yanganw fɛ** (It's about digital cameras and lenses). This is too general.  The question isn't simply about digital cameras and lenses; it's about the *specific relationship* between focal length and sensor size.
* **D: Yangan min ka ca diɲɛ kɔnɔ n’a bɛɛ ye o de do** (Lenses are all the same and that's enough). This is completely incorrect.  The passage emphasizes that lenses *aren't* the same and that their effect varies depending on the sensor.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, komi dilannikɛlaw bɛ ka kuntilenna ɲumanw dilanni caya, samali kuntilennaw fisayara cogodi?","The correct answer is **D: U sinsinyɔrɔ gɛlɛya ka dɔgɔn ka tɛmɛ kuntilenna fɔlɔw ta kan.**

Here's why:

* **The text describes Zoom's ability to focus on a speaker and follow them.** The question asks how Zoom can automatically follow a speaker.
* **Option D directly reflects this described functionality.** ""U sinsinyɔrɔ gɛlɛya ka dɔgɔn ka tɛmɛ kuntilenna fɔlɔw ta kan"" translates to ""It automatically finds the speaker and follows the camera."" This is precisely what the text explains Zoom does.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dɔfarala kuntilenna teliya kan** (Focuses on the camera lens). While important, it doesn't explain *how* the camera follows the speaker.
* **B: U labaara kadi yelen dɔgɔman yɔrɔw la** (It uses artificial intelligence to analyze the people's faces). While AI is involved, the text doesn't focus on face analysis as the primary mechanism for following the speaker.
* **C: Ja ɲɛ ni kuntilenna minnu sinsin yɔrɔ janya ni dansigilen b’a la de ye kelen ye** (It uses very sensitive and powerful cameras that are very small and compact). This describes the physical camera, not its functionality of following a speaker.



"
"Ka da tɛmɛsiran in kɔnɔ kunafoni kan, tuma jumɛn zoom lentiyew bɛ se ka fusaya ka tɛmɛ kuntilen fɔlɔw kan?","The correct answer is **A: Ni kuntilenɲa dayɛlɛnni dan ye laɲini dɔ ye** (The zoom function is based on the difference in the lens elements).

Here's why:

The text explains that zooming works by moving the lens elements relative to each other. This creates a change in the focal length, which results in the zoom effect.  Option A directly reflects this explanation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: N’i mago tɛ kuntilenɲa fɛnw canman na** (It's about the movement of the lens elements). While movement *is* involved, the *principle* isn't just the movement itself, but the *difference* in the lens elements.
* **C: N’i tɛ fɛ ka yelen mɛnɛ dibimayɔrɔw la** (It's about the arrangement of the lens elements). The arrangement is important, but the zoom *function* relies on how those elements are *moved*.
* **D: N’i bɛ ka fokali gɛlɛya wɛrɛ ɲini** (It's about changing the focal length). While changing focal length *is* the result of zooming, it doesn't explain *how* it happens. The text clarifies that it's through the movement of lens elements that the focal length is altered.

Nin fɛn jumɛn kelen tɛ se ka jate Misitisisimi bugunatigɛ hakika fɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka sinsin i yɛrɛ kelen pe ka faamuya-ɲininin kan o bɛ se ka sanka diinɛ ani batoko canman wɛrɛw ma.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Misitisisimi as a practice involving various rituals and offerings.** It mentions sacrifices (dinɛkulu), food (farafasiyali), and libations (walema tiɲɛnlaban).  It also talks about offerings to ancestors and spirits.
* **Question Q asks about the truth of Misitisisimi today.**
* **Option D directly addresses this by suggesting that Misitisisimi involves sacrifices and offerings to ancestors and spirits.** This implies a continuation of the practice, even if its specific forms may have changed.  It highlights the core elements that might still be relevant to understanding the practice's truth or validity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Sinsin kɛlen bɛ mɔgɔ ka bɛn ani nisɔndiya hakililatigɛ kan (Sacrifices are actions that people perform with respect for the ancestral spirits).** This is true *according to the passage*, but it doesn't answer the *question* about the truth of Misitisisimi today. It describes *what* is done, not *if* it still holds truth.
* **B: Misitisisimi mantow bɛ diinɛtiɲɛ ɲini (The offerings of Misitisisimi are sacred).** While the passage states offerings are made, it doesn't explicitly label them as ""sacred"" in a way that directly answers the question of its contemporary truth.  ""Sacred"" is a subjective term.
* **C: A bɛ se kɛ Misitisisimi kalandenw bɛ waleya dɔw kɛ minnuw b’a to u hakili bɛ Alako tiɲɛ famu (It is that Misitisisimi is a practice that is done in order to obtain the favor of the Ancestral Spirits).**  The passage indicates offerings are made *to* ancestors and spirits, but it doesn't explicitly state the *purpose* is to *obtain favor*. While likely, it's not explicitly stated as a central truth.



Therefore, option D is the most logically connected answer to the question about the truth of Misitisisimi today, given the information provided in the passage."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛn jumɛnw dɔlakelen tɛ Misitisisimi kuntilenna dɔ ye?","The correct answer is **C: Sinsinni hakilikunu kan min bɛ nunsɔndiya nati**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes the role of ""Misitisisimi"" (often translated as ""priestess"" or ""female diviner"") as a spiritual leader and intermediary.** They perform rituals, communicate with the spirits, and offer guidance.
* **Question Q asks about the source of their power/ability.**
* **Option C directly states that their power comes from the spirits/ancestors (nunsɔndiya).** This aligns with the text's description of their connection to the spiritual world.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sɔmin ɲinini diinɛkotiɲɛ la (The powerful female diviner of the spirits).** While the text describes them as powerful, this option doesn't explain *where* that power comes from.
* **B: Diinɛkosɛgɛsɛgɛli ɲuman ɲinili sigida mɔgɔw ka dɔɔnintilennen na (The ancestral spirits who are always listening to the people).** While the ancestors are mentioned, the text emphasizes the direct connection between the priestess and the spirits through rituals and communication, rather than simply the ancestors' passive listening.
* **D: Ka Alako danaya ɲininin (Because Alako is the most powerful).**  ""Alako"" (often translated as ""God"") is mentioned as a possible entity they communicate with, but the text doesn't say they derive their power *from* Alako in a direct way. The power comes from the spirits themselves.

"Ka kɛnɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn tun bɛ se ka sɛnɛla sigida sigi?","The correct answer is **B: Moriori ka bɔ Chatham gun sanfɛ**.

The text states: ""Pirewu kura y'a jira ko Morioriw kun ye Maori gɛlɛkan mɔgɔw ye minunw bɔra Nouvelle Zelande ka ta Chatham gun sanfɛ, nin u yɛrɛ ka sɛnɛcogo lafiyalen dilani ye.""  This translates to: ""The ancestors of Moriori were Maori who migrated to New Zealand and then to the Chatham Islands, where they lived in isolation.""

Therefore, the question asks where the Moriori migrated, and the text explicitly states they migrated to the Chatham Islands.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kulu minnu tun bɛ maos faga olu tun ye yɔrɔ jumɛn sigiba fɔlɔw ye?","The correct answer is **C: Chatham Gun**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pirewu kura y'a jira ko Morioriw kun ye Maori gɛlɛkan mɔgɔw ye minunw bɔra Nouvelle Zelande ka ta Chatham gun sanfɛ, nin u yɛrɛ ka sɛnɛcogo lafiyalen dilani ye."" 

Translation: ""The descendants who left the Moriori were the Maori who came from Polynesia to New Zealand and settled on the Chatham Islands, where they lived a difficult life.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions the Chatham Islands as the place where the Moriori were settled and faced hardship. The question asks where the descendants of the Moriori lived.
"
Lahaliya jumɛn na purelans ka oragi fɛɛrɛ bɛ kurulikɛla nafa?,"The correct answer is **B: Kurulikɛla in bɛ se kuruli la kosɛbɛ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Purelans origami ye origami dɔ ye minna kuriko kelen dɔrɔn de be se ka kɛ waati kelen kɔnɔ, kuruli gɛlɛnmanw ma daga inafɔ kuruli wolokilen, wa yɔrɔ ɲɔgɔnmanw de be kuruliw bɛɛ la."" This translates to: ""Purelans origami and origami are both types of paper folding, which is a way to make figures from paper, and the art of paper folding is made from paper.""
* **Option B accurately reflects this:** ""Kurulikɛla in bɛ se kuruli la kosɛbɛ"" translates to: ""Paper folding is a way of making figures from paper.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kurukɛla in b’a kanu ka kuruli camanw kɛ ɲɔgɔnfɛ:**  This translates to: ""Paper folding is a type of folding that is related to the art of decoration."" While paper folding *can* be decorative, the passage focuses on the *making of figures*.
* **C: Kurulikɛla bɛka origami dɔ ladan min mako bɛ kuruw la kɔfɛ:** This translates to: ""Paper folding is a type of origami that is often used to create animals."" The passage doesn't specify that paper folding is *always* used to make animals.
* **D: Kurulikɛlan y’a senfilɛ siɲɛ kɛlen walima siɲɛ fila:** This translates to: ""Paper folding has a very long history and has evolved over time."" While this might be true, the passage doesn't discuss the history of paper folding.

Nin fɛnw dɔlakelen jumɛn tɛ Purelans origami bugunatigɛ jaati?,"The correct answer is **D: Fɛrɛ ɲuman do min bɛ kurulikɛlaw dɛmɛ minnu te se kuruli la kɔsɛbɛ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""A tun labɛnna John Smith fɛ san 1970w kɔnɔna na walasa ka kurulikɛla kuraw dɛmɛ walima minnu lujuralen do.""  This means John Smith, starting in the 1970s, *developed* origami techniques and *published* books about them.

* **The question asks:** ""Nin fɛnw dɔlakelen jumɛn tɛ Purelans origami bugunatigɛ jaati?""  This translates to ""What is the current state of Purelans origami?""

* **Option D translates to:** ""The techniques and methods that were developed by John Smith and are now used for origami."" This directly addresses the current state, indicating that Purelans origami is built upon and uses the techniques pioneered by John Smith.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A dabɔlen bɛ kurulikɛla kɔrɔw de kama:** This translates to ""The origami techniques are coming into fashion.""  While origami is popular, this doesn't explain the *basis* of Purelans origami.
* **B: Kɔfɛ kuruw tɛ fɛrɛ in kɔnɔ:** This translates to ""Origami is a craft and a hobby."" This is a general statement and doesn't address Purelans origami specifically.
* **C: Yɔrɔ tilenɛw kakan ka kɛ kuruw la:** This translates to ""Origami is a new art form."" While origami has evolved, it's not a new art form; it has a long history.



Therefore, option D is the only one that logically follows from the passage and answers the question about the current state of Purelans origami."
"Kakɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, yɔrɔ jumɛn sɛn tɛ Indus ka Badingɛ Tabiya la?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The text states: ""Harappa bolo aka yɔrɔw fɔlɔfɔlɔw min wɔgɔbɛra 1920 sanw na."" which translates to ""Harappa, a city of the ancient civilization, was discovered in the 1920s.""  This directly links Harappa to the Indus Valley Civilization.
"
Nin fɛnw dɔlakelen jumɛn tɔgɔ ma fɔ tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ min be se ka kɛ kurukanfolon Tabiya tɔgɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Indus-Sarasvati Tabiya**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Hali n'a y'a sɔrɔ kodɔnna dɔw be k'a ŋunuŋunu ko k'a d'a kan ko tabiya in fana tunbe sisan **Sarasvati badingɛw la**..."" which translates to ""However, it is thought that the Indus River and the Sarasvati River were once connected..."".
*  It also mentions that ""a tɔgɔ tun kakan ka kɛ **Indus-Sarasvati tabiya** ye k'a sɔrɔ dɔw b'a fɔ a ma Harappan tabiya..."" which translates to ""...it is often considered that the Harappan civilization was based on the Indus-Sarasvati river system"".

Therefore, the Indus-Sarasvati River system is considered the foundational river system for the Harappan civilization, and thus the correct answer.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nafakuntalajan bɛ sɔrɔ nin fɛn jumɛn kelen na?","The correct answer is **C: Ka sisin kɛ fɛn min bɛ madamadɔ nafa ka tɛmɛ jamafanba kan.**

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks about the reason why the ""nafakuntalajan"" (which seems to refer to a specific action or state) has been abandoned.
* **The text (P)** states that people abandoned their traditional customs and behaviors because they were influenced by something else (indicated by ""ani o ye sigiɲɔgɔnkan cogoya ye ko""). 
* **Option C** translates to: ""It is because the things they were used to doing have become very difficult to do."" This directly addresses *why* people would abandon customs – because those customs are no longer practical or achievable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka baara kɛ ni ɔ ye** - ""It is because it is him/her."" This is too vague and doesn't explain the abandonment of customs.
* **B: K’i ka nafa bila ɲɛfɛ** - ""It is because they are afraid of evil."" While fear might play a role, it doesn't directly explain *why* the customs became difficult.
* **D: Ka sɔn a ma ko nafa bese ka sɔrɔ wasabaliya la** - ""It is because they have become obsessed with the customs of the Wassabaliya."" This implies a positive adoption of a new culture, which contradicts the idea of abandonment.

Therefore, **C** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text and question."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ bese ka nin fɛnw jumɛn kelen bila ɲɛfɛ n’a ka laɲini ye nafa teliman ye?","The correct answer is **D: Ɲɛngoya**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What is the meaning of the word *wasabaliya*?""
* **The first statement (P) defines *wasabaliya* as:** ""Wasabaliya is a person who is a great storyteller and who tells stories that are both interesting and have a moral lesson, and who is respected by the people.""
* **Therefore, *wasabaliya* directly translates to ""storyteller"" or ""narrator.""**  The option *Ɲɛngoya* means storyteller.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mɔgɔɲɛnɛnmaya:** This likely refers to a type of official or administrator, not a storyteller.
* **B: Baarakɛli nin ɲɔgɔn ye:** This means ""a respected and wise person,"" which is too general.  While a wasabaliya might be respected, the definition is more specific than that.
* **C: Jɛɲɔgɔnya:** This means ""a leader"" or ""chief,"" which is unrelated to storytelling.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni nin tɛmɛsira ye, jɔn ye kɛlɛ musakaw fanba sara?","The correct answer is **B: Wall Street warimarasow**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ka musakaw fanba sara ni nafaw juru dulonni tora Filipini marabulon na **Wall Street warimarasow** fɛ.""  This translates to ""...the musaka was bought in large quantities in the Philippines and sold to **Wall Street brokers**.""

Therefore, Wall Street brokers were the ones who bought the musaka and facilitated its trade.
"
Waati jumɛn kɔna diinɛkɛlɛcɛw ka tile ɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanfɛ Cɛmanɛ waati Laban**.

The text states: ""Tile minna ko nunuw kɛra be wele forobala ko Sanfɛ Cɛmancɛ Waati, Erɔpu tariku waati sankɛmɛsigi 11na, 12na ni 13na (san 1000-1300 Yesu bangeli kɔfɛ).

This translates to: ""The people who sought refuge were among the followers of the Catholic Church, European dates of 11th, 12th, and 13th (from 1000-1300 AD). The Catholic Church became the Catholic Dominicans and the Church became the Church of the Dominicans, which was founded around 1500 AD.""

Therefore, the question asks what the people sought refuge *in*. The text explicitly says they sought refuge in the **Catholic Church** (Sanfɛ Cɛmanɛ waati Laban).
"
Waati jumɛn fɔra diinɛkɛlɛcɛw ka tile kɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanfɛ Cɛmanɛ waati Laban**.

The text states: ""Tile minna ko nunuw kɛra be wele forobala ko Sanfɛ Cɛmancɛ Waati, Erɔpu tariku waati sankɛmɛsigi 11na, 12na ni 13na (san 1000-1300 Yesu bangeli kɔfɛ). Sanfɛ Cɛmancɛ Waati tugura Sanfɛ Cɛmancɛ Waati Daminɛ la wa Cɛmancɛ Waati laban tugura ola, min, ni bɛnkan na, banan san 1500 yɔrɔw la.""

This translates to: ""The most important events are related to the Council of Nicaea, European history in the years 11th, 12th, and 13th (from 1000-1300 AD). The Council of Nicaea gave rise to the Council of Nicaea Later, which gave rise to the Council of Nicaea Daminɛ, and which was held in the years 1500 AD.""

Therefore, the question asks where the Council of Nicaea Later was held, and the text answers that it was held in the Council of Nicaea Later.

Furakɛli suguya walima furakɛli sira jumɛn tɔgɔ m’a fɔ ni furakɛlikɛlaw ani farali furakɛlifaw tun bɛ baara kɛ n’a ye Roman Fanga waati?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka fogofogoyiri kisɛw kɛ ka isicopolamini dilan**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the Roman Empire is known for in terms of its ""furakɛli"" (likely referring to infrastructure or engineering). The text states: ""...furakɛlikɛlalaw ye dimidalafura caman dɔn inafɔ mɔrifini k'a bɔ sayiyirini kisɛw la ani isicopolamini k'a bɔ fogofogoyiri kisɛw la.""  This translates to ""...its infrastructure (or engineering) was known for building roads that connected towns and infrastructure (or engineering) for building bridges that spanned deep valleys.""

Option B directly reflects this: ""Ka fogofogoyiri kisɛw kɛ ka isicopolamini dilan"" means ""Bridges and infrastructure (or engineering).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jawilibana, min be mɔgɔ minɛ ka sabu kɛ jatigɛ wale kɔrɔ dɔ ye, ko furakɛ ni dimidafura suguyaw camanw ye** - This translates to ""In addition, we are known for the fact that we are a powerful people, with advanced and ingenious engineering."" While technically true (the text *does* say they are powerful and have advanced engineering), it's not the *specific* thing they are *known for* in the context of the question. It's a broader statement.
*   **C: Ko joli munumunni kunbɛn ni jolisiraw digili ye** - This translates to ""And also, for the fact that they are very skilled craftsmen and skilled artisans."" The text mentions skilled craftsmen, but the emphasis is on infrastructure/engineering, not craftsmanship itself.
*   **D: Ka kelebebanabaatow jɔlan tigɛ** - This translates to ""For the fact that they built roads connecting towns."" While roads are mentioned, the text also highlights bridges and overall infrastructure.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni nin tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛnw jumɛn kelen ma kɛ furakɛli ɲɛtaw nɔ ye Roman fangamara waati?","The correct answer is **A: Furakɛli baarakɛbolow sigili senkan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Roman Fangamara kɛlɛhakilina sira y'u dɛmɛ ka furakɛli ɲɛtaaw sɔrɔ. Furakɛlikɛlalaw y'a daminɛ ka ta baara la Fangamasa Augustus fɛ wa u ye Roman Furakɛlikɛli Baarakɛbolo fɔlɔ sigi senkan min tun kakan ka baarakɛ kɛlɛ kɔfɛ.""

This translates to: ""...Roman Fangamara are responsible for the authority of the people. These authorities are based on the tradition of the Roman Emperor Augustus, who was the Roman Emperor Baarakɛbolo based on the tradition of the ancestors, which has been passed down to this day.""

Therefore, the authorities (furakɛlikɛlalaw) are based on the tradition of the Emperor Baarakɛbolo (furakɛli baarakɛbolow). Option A accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fanga ka kɛlɛlɛmarahakilina fɛɛrɛw:** This refers to the responsibility of the Roman Fangamara, but doesn't specify *what* they are responsible for in terms of tradition.
* **C: Furakɛlikɛkalansow sigili senkan:** This is a grammatically incorrect option.
* **D: Furakɛlikɛlaw tali baara la fangamasa fɛ:** This translates to ""authorities who are based on the tradition of the Emperor,"" but is less precise than option A, which directly links the authorities to the Emperor Baarakɛbolo.



"
Yeli se sirilendon fɛn jumɛn la?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeli fasajuruw**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Who are the people who are traveling?"".  The first sentence states ""Lajɛlin, walima lajɛli se sirileno yeli fasajuruw fanw la walima ɲɛdenw"" which translates to ""Lajelin, the purpose of the travel is for the people traveling to visit"".  Therefore, the people traveling are ""yeli fasajuruw"" (travelers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baarakɛta fan dɔ ka laɲini** (The people who are well-dressed) - While they might be well-dressed, the sentence doesn't specify that.
* **C: Fɛgɛyali ni funufunuw janya ye** (The elders and the children) - This is not explicitly stated in the provided text.
* **D: Lajɛli ɲuman cogoya caya** (The purpose of the travel is to buy things) -  The text says the purpose is to visit, not to buy things.



"
ɲɛ dilani cogoya caya fan nin ɲɔgɔncɛ o sirilen do fɛn juman la?,"The correct answer is **A: Funufunu janya fɛgɛyali**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What kind of thing do they use to make the perfume fragrant?""
* **The text states:** ""...ali u mako baaraw cama la walasa kunfoni dɔn taw famuya ani jateden camaw ka baara kɛ a cogola."" This translates to ""...and they use a certain thing to make the perfume fragrant and to add a pleasant scent, and also a certain thing to make the perfume's color bright.""
* **""Funufunu janya fɛgɛyali""** translates to ""Fragrant powder"". This directly answers the question about what makes the perfume fragrant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baarakɛ fan ka laɲini** (Fragrant essence): While related, the text points to a *powder* rather than just an essence.
* **C: Lajɛli ɲuman cogoya** (Perfume ingredient): This is too general. The question asks about the *fragrant* component, not just any ingredient.
* **D: Baarakɛfan ka misɛnya** (Fragrant oil): Similar to option B, the text specifies a powder, not an oil.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni nin tɛmɛsiran ye, nin Sikhism kun kan kuma jumɛn tɛ diinɛ in bugunatikɛ faasi?","The best answer is **B: Guru ye Sikhism sinsinbereba min tɛ sɔrɔ diinɛ fosi wɛrɛ kɔnɔ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the role of the Gurus.** It states ""Guru ye Ɛndi diinɛw bɛɛ sinsinbeereba ye guru ye nka Sikhism na a ye nafan dɔ sɔrɔ min bɛ kɛ Sikhs ka danayabakuruba ye"" which translates to ""The Guru is the supreme teacher of Sikhism and is a guide that leads Sikhs to righteousness.""
* **The passage mentions Guru Nanak** as the founder, but it highlights the *ongoing* role of the Gurus as teachers.
* **Option A** is partially true (Sikhism originated in the Punjab region), but it doesn't answer the question of *what defines Sikhism today*.
* **Option C** is true (Guru Nanak was the first Guru), but it doesn't address the core principle of the Gurus' role in Sikhism's continuation.
* **Option D** is true (Sikhism rejected some aspects of Hinduism), but it doesn't answer the question of how Sikhism *continues* to be a religion today.

Therefore, option B best encapsulates the enduring importance of the Gurus in shaping and maintaining Sikhism as a relevant religion.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni nin tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛnw kele jumɛn be se ka jate nafɔ Sikh diinɛ sinsinbereba dɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Guru miirina**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Guru ye Ɛndi diinɛw bɛɛ sinsinbeereba ye guru ye nka Sikhism na a ye nafan dɔ sɔrɔ min bɛ kɛ Sikhs ka danayabakuruba ye."" This translates to: ""The Guru is the supreme spiritual teacher, and the Guru is the guide for Sikhs to live a righteous life.""

Therefore, the Guru is the central figure and the primary source of spiritual guidance in Sikhism.  The question asks about the spiritual teacher/guide in Sikhism.

This translates to: ""Jatekɛminɛbaliya Bana's people were given a certain knowledge, and they used this knowledge to build elaborate and magnificent structures, and they used it to create complex and sophisticated systems of governance and social organization.""

The phrase ""zuye kɛli walima i jaɲɛ wakulɔni filɛli walima kumasen sɛbɛni nin tomi sɛbɛn baliya ye"" (complex and sophisticated systems of governance and social organization) directly points to **fɛn minnu kɛli ka d’u ye** (elaborate and magnificent structures/systems). While other options are mentioned as aspects of their knowledge, this is the most accurate answer to the question of what they used their knowledge to ""gɛlɛya u ma k’u sinsin mun de kan"" (apply it to build).

The text states: ""Jatekɛminɛbaliya Bana be denmisɛni minunw na be gɛlɛya sɔrɔ walasa ko ɲɛsin fɛnw ma inafɔ lɛkɔli baara, nka u be seka ɲsɛin fɛnw ma minw ka d'o ye inafɔ zuye kɛli walima i jaɲɛ wakulɔni filɛli walima kumasen sɛbɛni nin tomi sɛbɛn baliya ye.

This clearly indicates that they use *nisondiya* (a type of traditional medicine or herbal remedy) along with other things like farati, kelew, and fagan.  Therefore, ""K’u hakili nisɔndiya"" (They use nisondiya) is the most accurate answer.

"Ka da kunafoni dilen kan tɛmɛsir in kɔnɔ, ninnu jumɛn de tɛ dɛmɛli kalan misali ye?","The correct answer is **A: Kanlansen dɔ ɔridinatɛri zuye daminɛ na**.

Here's why:

The text describes various types of software, including those for:

*   Word processing
*   Spreadsheets
*   Presentations
*   Database management
*   Email

The question asks which of the listed options is a computer program used to do all of these things.  ""Kanlansen dɔ ɔridinatɛri zuye daminɛ na"" (Desktop computer software) is the most encompassing answer, as it includes all the functionalities mentioned in the text.

Let's break down the other options:

*   **B: SAT kalanfa** (SAT Exam) - This is an exam, not a software program.
*   **C: Damana kalan bolodalen dɔ** (Mobile application) - While mobile applications can perform *some* of the functions described, they aren't generally designed to do *all* of them in the same way desktop software is.
*   **D: Kalanfa jɛkulu fitini dɔ** (Web browser) - A web browser is used to access internet-based applications, but it's not a program itself that performs word processing, spreadsheets, etc.

Therefore, the best and most accurate answer is **A**."
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ dɛmɛli kalan hakilina ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Dɛmɛli kalanw bɛ se ka kɛ ɛntɛrinɛti kan** (Software can be found on the internet).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kalan dɛmɛliw be seka ɛntɛrɛnɛti sanfɛ ani kɛnɛ kan..."" (Software is found on the internet and also...).  This directly answers the question of where software can be found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A dɛmɛlaman de do ka tɛmɛ kalan cogolaman kan** (Software is created by developers). While true, the question asks *where to find* software, not *who makes it*.
* **C: A dɔn ne fɛnɛ do inafɔ kalancɛcogo min sinsinnen do baara dɔ kan** (Software is based on simple and common programming languages). The passage doesn't focus on programming languages.
* **D: Dɛmɛli kalanw bɛ kɛ walasa ka dɛmɛkɛ kalan daminɛ la** (Software is a tool for creating other software). While software *can* be used to create other software, the passage doesn't highlight this as its primary function or where to find it.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, MySpace baarakɛcogo jumɛn be se ka kalandenw dɛmɛ kalanjɛ ka gɛlɛn minnu ma?","The correct answer is **D: Porofili miliyɔn 54**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rũrenda rũrĩa rwa gatatũ kũmenyekana mũno nĩ ta MySpace bũrũri-inĩ wa Amerika, na rũtũmagĩro nĩ arũmĩrĩri matanyihĩirie millioni mĩrongo ĩtũna na inya.""

Translation: ""The third-most popular site found here is MySpace in the American community, and its number of members reached fifty-four million and more.""

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, MySpace baarakɛcogo jumɛn be se ka kalandenw dɛmɛ kalanjɛ ka gɛlɛn minnu ma?"" (How many members did MySpace have at its peak?) is 54 million.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de tun tɛ Krushchev ka jaabi la ka ɲɛsin baarakɛlaw ka mankanw ma?","The correct answer is **B: Ka mugucimɔbiliw bila ka ta basigilanati** (Because the leaders who are in power).

Here's why:

* The text states that Khrushchev, as the leader (mugucimɔbili bila ka ta basigilanati), sent troops into Poland to suppress the protests. 
* Option B directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka minisiri ɲɛmɔgɔ kura dɔ sigi** (Because the Prime Minister was in power): While the Prime Minister (Wadyslaw Gomulka) was involved, Khrushchev's actions were driven by the broader political power of the Soviet Union.  The text emphasizes Khrushchev's role as the leader.
* **C: Ka dɔfara sara jiginni kan** (Because of the loss of the election): The text mentions the election of Gomulka, but it's the *response* to that election (the protests) that triggered Khrushchev's actions. The loss of the election wasn't the direct cause of the troop deployment.
* **D: Sɔrɔsira ɲinini dɔw lakodɔnni** (Because of the internal conflicts): While there were internal conflicts in Poland, the text specifically links Khrushchev's action to the *protests* and the *election results* which he perceived as a challenge to Soviet control.



"
Ninnu jumɛn de tun te makanw kun ye Polɔɲi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kominizimu (Communism)**.

The passage states that Kruschev ""dɛsɛra sɔrɔsira gɛlɛya dɔw la an'a sɔnna ka jamatigi Wadyslaw Gomulka kɛ Minisiri Ɲɛmɔgɔ kura ye"" which translates to ""was forced to accept the leadership of the party leader Wladyslaw Gomulka as the Prime Minister.""  The passage also mentions that Kruschev's aim was to ""laban foroba murutili la Kominizimu kama"" meaning ""to prevent the revival of Communism.""  Therefore, the core issue being addressed is Communism.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de ma fɛn kɛ USSR ni USA ka jɛɲɔgɔnya la?","The correct answer is **D: Sisitɛmuw kukan kɛlɛw (The Cold War)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a period of intense competition between Germany, the USSR, and the USA. It mentions the division of Germany, the development of weapons, and the spread of influence to various regions.  These are all key characteristics of the Cold War.

* **A: Taabolo danfara (The Beginning of the Table)** - This doesn't fit the context.
* **B: Hakilinaw Alimaɲi kan (The German Government)** - While Germany was central, the conflict was broader than just the German government.
* **C: Danfara ɲini baaraw (The Power of the Animals)** - This is completely irrelevant.
* **D: Sisitɛmuw kukan kɛlɛw (The Cold War)** - This accurately describes the global political and ideological struggle between the USSR and the USA, which Germany was a major player in.



"
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ fasa cikanw cili ka ta farikolola kun ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka joli bolili ɲɛnabɔ**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q):** ""Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ fasa cikanw cili ka ta farikolola kun ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ?"" translates to ""What kind of small animals do they catch to eat?""
* **The initial statement (P):**  Describes a situation where small animals are caught and eaten, even if they are small and difficult to find. It emphasizes the act of catching and eating.
* **Option B: Ka joli bolili ɲɛnabɔ** translates to ""They catch small animals that are plentiful."" This directly answers the question of *what kind* of small animals are caught, suggesting they are plentiful.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ka joli bolili sumaya** (""They catch small animals that are special/unique"") doesn't fit the context of regular catching for food.
    * **C: K’a cogoya mara** (""They catch a lot/many"") describes the quantity, not the type of animal.
    * **D: Ka tangali kɛ ka bɔ bagabaliw ma minnu bɛ se ka kɛ farikolola** (""They catch and even eat the bones of the animals"") is a detail about what happens *after* catching, not what they catch to eat initially.

Therefore, option B is the most logical and direct answer to the question based on the provided text."
Mun de bɛ se ka sɔrɔ The Giza Plateau la?,"The correct answer is **D: PiramidiBa in**.

The text explicitly states: ""Giza Kulu, walema """"Giza Kaburukulu"""" Misira jamana Suw ka Lɛ kɔnɔ ye piramidiw caman..."" which translates to ""Giza Plateau, also known as 'Giza Necropolis' in ancient Egyptian, consists of pyramids..."". The rest of the paragraph details what's *in* the Giza Plateau - pyramids, tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
"
Piramidi Ba kun tun ye mun ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka tasibilakɛ Firawuna dɔ ye** (To bury Pharaoh).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Piramidiba jɔra ka Farawuna Khufu tasibila, ani piramidideniw, kaburuw, ni sɔnnikɛyɔrɔw cama tun jɔra ka taasibila kɛ ka ɲɛsin Khufu musow ni dudenw ma."" This translates to: ""The pyramids were built to bury Pharaoh Khufu, and the pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to serve to bury Khufu's remains and possessions.""

Therefore, the primary purpose of the pyramids was to bury Pharaohs.
"
Jɔnni y’an ka tasumadonwale dɔnni sabu ye min ye tasumadonwale sɔnnikɛyɔrɔ tiɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Zulu Kara Nani**.

The passage states: ""Zulu Kara Nani, k'a to masaya la, y'a ɲini ka mɔgɔw sara ka sɔnnikɛyɔrɔ in kurakuraya, ɲa ban kɛra a ka laɲini ma. kɔfɛ, Zulu Kara Nani saalen kɔ, sɔnnikɛyɔrɔ kurakurayara san 323 Yesu Bangelen kɔ."" 

This translates to: ""Zulu Kara Nani, who was a priestess, was angry that people were worshiping the goddess Artemis, and she was very angry about it. Therefore, Zulu Kara Nani led the people to destroy the temple of Jesus in 323.""

The question asks who led the people to destroy the temple of Artemis. The passage directly names Zulu Kara Nani as the one who did this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ephesuskaw** - Ephesus was the location of the temple, but not the person who destroyed it.
* **C: Strado** - Strabo is a Greek geographer mentioned as having written about the temple, but he didn't destroy it.
* **D: Artemis** - Artemis is the goddess whose temple was destroyed, not the person who destroyed it.



"
Kumasen jumɛn ye tiɲɛ ye ka ɲɛsin Artemis sɔnnikɛyɔrɔ jɔli ma kokura?,"The correct answer is **A: A jɔli kokura o baaraw sarala Zulu Kara Nani**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Zulu Kara Nani, k'a to masaya la, y'a ɲini ka mɔgɔw sara ka sɔnnikɛyɔrɔ in kurakuraya, ɲa ban kɛra a ka laɲini ma."" This translates to ""Zulu Kara Nani, who was a priestess, was angry that people celebrated the Artemis temple, and she was very upset by it.""
* It then mentions that Zulu Kara Nani caused the temple to be burned down.

Therefore, Zulu Kara Nani was the one who instigated the destruction of the Artemis temple.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A jɔra kokura Zulu Kara Nani ka mara kɔfɛ:** This translates to ""Zulu Kara Nani caused the destruction of the temple later.""  The text implies she caused it *at* the time of the celebration.
* **C: Herostratus yamaruyara ka jɔlikokura wari sara:** This translates to ""Herostratus was responsible for the destruction."" The text clearly states Zulu Kara Nani was responsible.
* **D: A jɔra kokura 320 ka kɔn Yesu bangeli ɲɛ:** This translates to ""She caused the destruction 320 years after Jesus' birth."" The text provides a timeline related to Jesus' death, not the temple destruction.

The passage states: ""Tamali sen fila kan cogoya sinsinlen sɔrɔla Australopithecus kaburuw la kabɔ san miliyɔn 4.2 ka ta bila san miliyɔn 3.9 tɛmɛni...""  This translates to ""The oldest fossils are attributed to Australopithecus robustus and date back to around 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago.""
"
Nin danfɛn jumɛnw de tun bɛ tama u sen fila kan tuma bɛɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ali na sɔrɔ Sahelanthropus kun tamara lala a sen fila kan inafɔ miliyɔn wɔlɔnwula tɛmɛni damina la."" This translates to ""and the Sahelanthropus, whose oldest fossil dates back to approximately 6 million years ago.""

The question asks which of the options represents the oldest fossil. Sahelanthropus is explicitly mentioned as having the oldest fossil among the options provided.
"

The text states: ""Alimaɲi kɛlɛkɛ bato kulu, ye U-boats nati kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala, kun beka laɲinin ka bato boli jɔ. Nin jɛnɲɔgɔnw kun dɛsɛla, lala Alimaɲi kun be seka na Grande Bretagne minɛ inafɔ a kun ye Erɔpu fan tɔw."" (German large ships, and U-boats, were very effective at sinking ships.  At first, they attacked British shipping in the Atlantic.)

"Ka da kunnafoni dilen kan tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, jɔn ye se ba sɔrɔ kɔgɔji kɛlɛ la Atlantic Woroduguyanfan Kanpaɲi na?","The correct answer is **C: Alimanw ni Biritanikiw**.

The passage states that the war involved ""Lamerikɛn kun be ka laɲinin ko ka mɔgɔw ani kɛlɛkɛminɛnw mobilize Oseyan Atlantic sanfɛ walasa ka Grande Bretagne dɛmɛ."" (Americans mobilized men and resources to patrol the Atlantic Ocean to protect Great Britain). It also mentions ""Alimaɲi kɛlɛkɛ bato kulu, ye U-boats nati kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala, kun beka laɲinin ka bato boli jɔ."" (German large ships and U-boats sank many ships). This clearly indicates that both Germany and Britain were major players in the Battle of the Atlantic.
"
Mun de tun tɛ yen tuma min na Asariyaniw ye so kɔ sanfɛ kɛlɛ daminɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Wotorow**.

The text states: ""San 1000 yani Yesu bangeli cɛ Asariyaniw ye sokankɛlɛ daminɛ. Sokankɛlɛkɛla ye kɛlɛbolo ye min be kɛlɛ kɛ k'a to so kan. **Kɛrɛkɛ tun ma dilan fɔlɔ, o la Asariyaniw tun be kɛlɛ kɛ k'u to uka so kɔ jalanw kan.**""

This translates to: ""Around 1000 years ago, Jesus spoke of the great power of the Assyrians. Their power was something that was to come to pass. **And, as it has been foretold, the Assyrians went to conquer the nations.**""

Therefore, the question asks *what* the Assyrians went to conquer, and the answer is their **power** (represented by ""wotorow"" in the text).
"
"Kɛlɛ minnu tun bɛ kɛ so kɔkan, olu bɛ cogodi?","The correct answer is **C: So kɔkan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""San 1000 yani Yesu bangeli cɛ Asariyaniw ye sokankɛlɛ daminɛ."" This translates to ""Around the year 1000, the prophets warned the Assyrians of their impending doom.""

The question asks ""Kɛlɛ minnu tun bɛ kɛ so kɔkan, olu bɛ cogodi?"" which means ""What did they warn them about?""

The answer ""So kɔkan"" (their doom/destruction) directly corresponds to the warning given to the Assyrians.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Senna** - This word doesn't appear in the text and doesn't make sense in the context.
*   **B: Kɛlɛkɛfinin tan** - This translates to ""The power of the gods."" While mentioned in the text as something the Assyrians relied on, it's not the direct warning.
*   **D: Dɔbɔlen kɛlɛcɛw la** - This means ""The power of the prophets."" The prophets *gave* the warning, they weren't the thing being warned *about*.

Therefore, **So kɔkan (their doom)** is the most accurate answer.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, i tɛ Babyloneka ka sɔrɔ yɔrɔ jumɛn na?","The correct answer is **C: Ɲɛnajɛ dɔ la sɔnniyɔrɔ dukɛnɛla** (The gods were the rulers of Babylon).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Babylonekaw kun ye sofɔlɔ dɔ jɔ u ka jow kelenkelenna bɛ ye min kun jatera ka kɛ ala ka so ye."" (Babylonians considered the gods as the most important things to worship and to honor).
* **It further explains:** ""Mɔgɔw kun bɛ sarakaw bɔ jow ye ani sɔnnikɛla kun b'a ɲini ka jow ka laɲini batoni sarakaw ni ɲɛnagɛw ye."" (People worshiped the gods and built beautiful temples to honor the gods and goddesses).
* **And it concludes:** ""Towɛri in balen tun ye ala in bato kɛ yɔrɔ kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen ye."" (The towers were like mountains made of baked brick). This reinforces the idea of grand structures dedicated to the gods.

Option C directly reflects the core idea that the gods held a position of power and rulership in Babylonian society, as evidenced by their worship and the monumental structures built in their honor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka na ni sarakaw ye sɔnniyɔrɔ dukɛnɛna** (The gods were the leaders of the kings). While gods were important, the passage doesn't suggest they were *leaders* of the kings.
* **B: Ka taa ɲɛnajɛ kɛ sɔnniyɔrɔ fɔlɔ dɔ la** (The gods were the followers of the kings). This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **D: Ka ta ni sarakaw ye sɔnnikɛ soɲɛkɔnɔ kɔnɔ** (The gods were the companions of the beautiful things). This is too vague and doesn't capture the importance of the gods in Babylonian society.



"
Nin fɛn jumɛn kelen tun dabɔlen do sɔnnikɛlaw kama kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnenya la?,"The correct answer is **D: Ziggurats**.

Waati jumɛn Masa Tutankhamun ye tɔgɔtigiya sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: A kaburu yeli kɔfɛ (He was buried in a tomb)**.

The text states: ""Nka a kaburu yeli san 1922 y'a kɛ tɔgɔtigi ye."" which translates to ""And his tomb was discovered in 1922 by archaeologists.""
"
Mun tun ye Tutankhamun kɛ Izipiti Masa dɔnnen ba dɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **C: A kaburu wɔgɔbɛli ka fɛnɲumanw ta** (He was buried in a tomb with treasures).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""A kaburu yeli san 1922 y'a kɛ tɔgɔtigi ye. Tuma minna kaburu cama wɔgɔbɛra, se ma kɛ ni kaburu in ma."" which translates to: ""His tomb was discovered in 1922 by archaeologists. His tomb was found with treasures inside.""
* Option C directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A kaburu min tun tora a cogo la o kɛli** (His tomb was discovered and it was small). While the tomb *was* small for a pharaoh, the passage doesn't highlight its small size as the key fact.
* **B: A tɔgɔ jateli Masa dɔnnenw fɛ** (He was given treasures by the pharaohs). The passage doesn't mention being ""given"" treasures by other pharaohs; it states the treasures were *inside* his tomb.
* **D: Nafa min tun b’a la lawale Izipiti kɔrɔ kaw ka waati la** (He was a ruler in ancient Egypt). The passage confirms he was a pharaoh (a ruler), but the question specifically asks where he was buried.



"
Gɛrɛki poyi bɔla Homer tun tese ka mun kɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka yeli kɛ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Homer de kakan ka kɛ u bɛɛ la tɔgɔtigi ye, ni fiyɛntɔ poyi bɔla dagabana in, min ye dagabana sɛbɛnni fila kɛ Gɛrɛki sɛbɛnniw la : Iliad ni Odyssey poyiw."" This translates to: ""Homer is considered the author of these epic poems, and the most famous are the Iliad and the Odyssey.""

Therefore, the answer is ""Ka yeli kɛ"" which means ""is considered"" or ""is regarded as.""
"
Gɛrɛki tɔgɔtigi jumɛn dɔnna fɛn wɛrɛ sababu la min tɛ sɛbɛni baara ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Sophocoles**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sophocoles ni Aristophanes ye hali sisan sɛbɛnnikɛla tɔgɔtigiw ye wa uka sɛbɛnniw be jate diyɛn sɛbɛnni baara baw cɛ la."" This translates to ""Sophocles and Aristophanes are both known for their plays that depict characters who are dealing with their own inner conflicts.""

While Homer is mentioned as a storyteller of the Iliad and Odyssey, the passage specifically links Sophocles to the theme of characters dealing with inner conflicts. The other options (Pythagoras and Aristophanes) aren't directly linked to this specific characteristic in the text.

Therefore, Sophocles is the most relevant answer.
"
Izirayɛli denbayaw tun b’u ka waati fanba bɛɛ kɛ yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **C: Dukɛnɛ ma**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Musow tun be tobili kɛ dukɛnɛ na;"" which translates to ""The people were scattered among the nations.""  This directly answers the question of where the Israelites went after the events described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kɛnɛma fiɲɛ na** (After a long time) - While this might be true, the passage doesn't explicitly say *how long* they were scattered.
* **B: Nbɛda la** (In exile) - While they were in exile in a sense, the passage emphasizes being scattered *among* other nations, not just a formal exile.
* **D: So kɔnɔ** (To a certain place) - The passage doesn't specify a particular place they went. They were dispersed.



"
Mun nafa tun man bon kosɛbɛ Izirayɛli denbayaw bolo?,"The correct answer is **D: U ka tobili**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Musow tun be tobili kɛ dukɛnɛ na; feerekɛso tun yɔrɔda bɔlen ye ka ɲɛsin nbeda ma.""  This translates to: ""The people were scattered among the nations; the Philistines commanded them to pay tribute.""

This means the Israelites were in a bad situation because they were scattered and forced to pay tribute. Therefore, they were not thriving and not living well.  ""Tobili"" (tobili) means ""scattered"" or ""dispersed.""



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U ka waati cogoya** (It was a time of plenty): The passage describes hardship, not plenty.
*   **B: U ka feerekɛsow** (It was the time of the Philistines): While the Philistines are mentioned, the passage describes the Israelites' state, not the Philistines' time.
*   **C: U ka so** (It was a time of growth):  The passage describes being scattered, not growth."
Nin fɛnw jumɛn kelen ɲɛfɔlen tɛ ka kɛ Sikandinavi jamanaw danfara ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Taariku (History)**.

The text states: ""...jamana kelen kelen tun ye """"Sikandinavi kaw"""" ye, danfara caman tun be Danemariki, Suwɛdi, Nɔriwɛzi ani Isilandi mɔgɔw, masaw, laadaw ni **tarikuw** ni ɲɔkɔncɛ.""

The word ""tarikuw"" means history. Therefore, the Scandinavian region is defined by its history, culture, and heritage.
"
Jɔn fɔlɔ tun sigira Greenland?,"The correct answer is **C: Erik Bilen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Norse maanaw la u b'a fɔ ko Erik Bilen bolila ka bɔ Isilandi jamana kɔnɔ ka sabu kɛ mɔgɔfaga dɔ ye...""  This translates to ""Norse men went to settle in Iceland under Erik the Red, because there was a lot of land...""  This directly links Erik the Red to the Norse settlement in Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eskimo siyaw** - Eskimos (also known as Inuit) arrived in Greenland *after* the Norse. The text mentions they arrived later.
*   **B: Nɔriwɛzi kaw** - While Norwegians were involved, the text specifically names Erik the Red as the leader of the initial settlement.
*   **D: Suwɛdi mɔgɔw** - Swedes are not mentioned in the text in relation to Greenland.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Romain musowaaritigiw kun bɛ dumuni kɛra u sigilen sikilanw kan..."" This translates to ""Roman merchants were the ones who traveled and established trade routes...""  The question asks who established trade routes, and the passage directly identifies the Roman merchants (musowaaritigiw) as the ones responsible.

This translates to: ""The Romans spread their influence to Europe and even to America and Arab lands, and brought back goods such as cotton, tomatoes, tobacco, and cocoa. And the Romans also enjoyed luxurious things.""

The question asks *what* the Romans brought back *as a result of their influence*. The passage directly states they brought back ""dunan fantaw ka dumuni kɛ u sigilen sigilan sanfɛ"" - which means ""goods from countries they influenced and where they established themselves"".  This highlights that the goods were a consequence of the Romans' expansion and established presence in other regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kɔtɛ dumuniw minnuw bɛ kɔkɔn lawuli** (The countries they influenced were very wealthy) - While some of the areas were wealthy, the passage doesn't emphasize wealth as the main reason for the Romans' interest.
* **C: Cɛwaaritigiw dalen ka surɔfana dun** (The army was very strong) -  The passage mentions the army's role in spreading influence, but it doesn't specifically say the army was *very strong* as the *result* of bringing back goods.
* **D: Kulokulo wɔrɔtilen tasaɲɛkelen** (Luxurious things were the main goal) - While the Romans *did* enjoy luxurious things, the passage focuses on the exchange of goods and influence, not just the Romans' pursuit of luxury.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni nin tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛnw jumɛn kelen te se ka wolo nafa sabatilen na?","The correct answer is **D: Sigida seko ni dɔnko**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the origin of the concept of ""civilisation"" (hadamadenyataabolo).** It explains that the word derives from Latin and relates to the idea of a ""civilised"" citizen and community.
* **The passage then states that ""civilisation"" is built upon the accumulation of knowledge and skills over time.** It emphasizes the role of accumulated wisdom and experience.
* **Option D, ""Sigida seko ni dɔnko"" (Accumulated knowledge and skills), directly reflects this core idea.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sigida dɔ (Knowledge itself):** While knowledge is important, the passage stresses that it's the *accumulated* knowledge and skills over generations that define civilisation.
* **B: Seko ni dɔnko fitini (The process of accumulating knowledge and skills):** This describes *how* civilisation is built, not what it *is* fundamentally composed of.
* **C: Dugu-jamana dɔ (The accumulated wisdom of generations):** This is a good related concept, but ""Sigida seko ni dɔnko"" is the more encompassing term used in the passage to describe the fundamental building blocks of civilisation.

Here's why:

* **The passage explains the origin of ""civilisation""**: It traces the word back to Latin (""civilis"") and connects it to the concept of citizens (""civis"") and the city-state (""civitas""). It describes early civilizations as being formed by groups of people who lived together and developed a sophisticated culture and political system.
* **The question asks what is the origin of civilisation**: The passage explicitly states that the origin lies in the ""seko ni dɔnko fitiniw be tunu tuma dɔw la k'a sɔrɔ u ma nɔ ɲɛnama to tariku la wa u te se ka lakodon inafɔ hadamadenyataabolo yɛrɛyɛrɛ"" – meaning ""the origin lies in the evolving culture and political system that eventually led to the formation of civilizations."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sigida seko ni dɔnko (Early civilizations)** - While early civilizations are a *result* of the origin, the question asks for the *origin* itself.
* **B: Seko ni dɔnko kɛrɛnkɛrɛn dɔ (Complex cultures)** - Complex cultures are a *feature* of civilizations, not their origin.
* **C: Dugu-jamana dɔ (City-states)** - City-states are a *type* of political system found in early civilizations, but not the ultimate origin of the concept of civilisation.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Drukgyal Dzong ye tarakogo ni Budawdelikɛyɔrɔ ye Paro faaba kɔnɔ (Phondey dugu kɔnɔ). A fɔra ko san 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ye taracogo jɔ ka hakilijigi kɛ ka kɛ ɲɛsin a ka se ma Tibɛti-Mɔngɔlikaw ka kɛlɛcɛw kan.""

This translates to: ""Drukgyal Dzong is a fortress and a sacred place of Paro valley (Phondey dugu). It was built in 1649, and Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, as a protector, built it to be a defense against the Tibetan-Mongolian invasion.""

Therefore, the text explicitly says that Drukgyal Dzong was built to be a defense against the Tibetan-Mongolian invasion.  Option A reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A be Bhutan kɔnɔ** - While Drukgyal Dzong *is* in Bhutan, the question asks *why* it was built, not *where* it is located.
* **C: Tasuma dɔ ye jasɛbɛnfuraw canma jeni** - This option refers to the invaders, not the purpose of building the Dzong.
* **D: A jɔra Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel fɛ** -  While Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel commissioned the building, the question asks *why* it was built, not *who* built it.



"

Here's why:

* The provided text states: ""San 1951, tasuma dɔ mɛnɛni kɛra sababu ye Drukgyal Dzong jasɛbɛnfura damadama dɔrɔn tora, i n'a fɔ Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ja.""  This translates to: ""In 1951, the reason for the destruction of Drukgyal Dzong was the rebellion of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jasɛbɛnfura kelen min tora o tun ye Zhabsdrung Ngawang Namgyel ja ye** (The reason for the destruction was the rebellion of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel): While partially correct, it doesn't fully capture the *reason* behind the rebellion. The text indicates the rebellion *caused* the destruction, but the text doesn't explicitly state the reason *for* the rebellion itself.
* **B: Tibɛti-Mɔngɔlikaw ka kɛlɛcɛw tun ye se sɔrɔ** (It was destroyed by the Tibetan-Mongol invasion): The text mentions a Tibetan-Mongol invasion in the past, but it doesn't state that *this* invasion destroyed Drukgyal Dzong in 1951.
* **C: A ma fosi bɔ filifɛn in diyaɲɛ la** (It was destroyed by a powerful enemy): While Drukgyal Dzong was destroyed, the text specifically identifies the cause as the rebellion of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, not a generic ""powerful enemy.""



Therefore, option D is the most accurate and directly supported by the text."

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kɛmɛsi 18na labanw na Viyetinamukaw fɛnɛ ye Kanbɔji minɛ."" This translates to ""In the 18th century, Vietnam dominated Cambodia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Viyetinamukaw ka ye Phnom Phen filenkolonci ka dakolonci:** While Vietnam *did* influence Phnom Penh, the passage emphasizes the broader domination of Cambodia in the 18th century, not just control of the capital.
* **B: Kanbɔji ye Tayilandi minɛ san 1772:**  The passage mentions the establishment of Phnom Penh in 1772 due to the relationship between Cambodia and Thailand, but it's not the core answer to the question about Vietnam's influence.
* **D: Tayilandikaw ye Phnom Phen filenkolonci ka dakakolonci:** The passage focuses on Vietnam, not Thailand, and while Thailand had influence, the question asks about *Vietnam's* domination.



Therefore, option C directly reflects the information provided in the passage about Vietnam's dominance over Cambodia in the 18th century.

* The provided text states: ""Kɛmɛsi 18na labanw na Viyetinamukaw fɛnɛ ye Kanbɔji minɛ."" which translates to ""In the 18th century, Vietnam and Cambodia were at war.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tayilandikaw ani Viyetinamukaw ye Kanbɔji minɛ san 1772:** While Thailand was involved, the text mentions the war between Vietnam and Cambodia in the 18th century, not specifically the year 1772.
* **C: Viyetinamukaw ka ye Phnom Phen filenkolonci ka dakolonci:** The text mentions Phnom Penh as a capital, but it doesn't say Vietnam colonized it or that it was decolonized.
* **D: Tayilandikaw ye Kanbɔji minɛ siɲɛ canman:**  The text states Vietnam and Cambodia were at war, not that Thailand and Cambodia were at war.

The passage states: ""1624 san, Peyiba cakɛda East India Company ye jujɔn dɔ sigi Tayiwani worodugutilebinyanfan na, ka bayɛlɛmani dɔ judon ka ɲɛsin sumakisɛlakika-labaaraliw ma ani ka Sini baarakɛraw ta k'a malo ni sukarofoorow labaara.""

This translates to: ""In 1624, Philip (Peyiba) founded the East India Company, and the company's purpose was to engage in lucrative trade with Chinese and Japanese markets, especially for silk and sugar.""

Therefore, the East India Company went to Taiwan for lucrative trade, specifically involving silk and sugar.

* The text states: ""1895 san, a dɛsɛni kɔ ka sebagaya sɔrɔ Sinuwa-Zapɔnɛkɛlɛfɔlɔ la (1894-1895), Qing marabylon ye bolonɔnbila kɛ Shimonoseki bɛnkan na, min kɔnɔ a jɛnna Tayiwani tigiya kɔ k'a si Zapɔn ma, min ye gun mara fo san 1945."" This translates to: ""In 1895, as a result of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty was defeated and forced to sign the Shimonoseki Treaty, which ceded Taiwan to Japan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zapɔn dɛsɛni ka sebaya sɔrɔ Sinuwa-Zapɔnɛkɛlɛfɔlɔ la** (Japan participated in the First Sino-Japanese War) - While true, this doesn't answer the question of *what* the Shimonoseki Treaty resulted in.
* **B: Tayiwani lahalaya min b’a kɛ Qing fangabolokɛlɛcɛw ka mara kɔnɔ** (Taiwan was under the control of the Qing dynasty) -  This is true for a period, but the question asks about the result of the Shimonoseki Treaty.
* **C: Tayiwani seli k’a ka mara kuraya a ka badabolow kan** (Taiwan was a place of high trade and development) - This is not directly related to the Shimonoseki Treaty and the transfer of control.

Danifɛnw bayɛlɛman kundama be suman cogo di?,"The correct answer is **C: Hydrogene ions kundama nin be bayɛlɛma kɔnɔ** (Hydrogen ions are the cause of acidity).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""PH kundaman jirara ni Hydrogene hakɛ ye (H⁺ la) ɲɛɲini i na."" which translates to ""The pH level is determined by Hydrogen ions (H⁺).""
* **The passage also explains:** ""Hydrogene ions ye protons ye munu ka electrons samanra ka bɔ..."" which means ""Hydrogen ions are protons that can accept electrons...""
* **Acidity and alkalinity are linked to hydrogen ion concentration.**  A higher concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) indicates acidity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Asidi walima basiki ŋakaminlen be bayɛlɛma la cogo min** (Acids and alkalis are the cause of acidity): While acids and alkalis *influence* acidity, the *direct* cause is the concentration of hydrogen ions.
* **B: Protons joli bɛ bayɛlɛma kɔnɔ** (Protons are the cause of acidity): While hydrogen ions *are* protons, the passage specifically refers to *hydrogen ions* (H⁺) as the determinant of pH.
* **D: Electrons kundama joli be bayɛlɛma kɔnɔ** (Electrons are the cause of acidity): Electrons play a role in chemical reactions, but they aren't the direct cause of acidity.  Acidity is about the *presence* of hydrogen ions.



"
Mun tun bɔra Hydrogene ions la?,"The correct answer is **A: Protons**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hydrogene ions ye protons ye munu ka electrons samanra ka bɔ...""  This directly translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that can gain electrons...""  Therefore, hydrogen ions are protons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH:** pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity, not the ion itself.
* **C: Alkaline:** Alkaline describes a substance with a high pH, not the ion.
* **D: Electrons:** Electrons are negatively charged particles; hydrogen ions are positively charged (because they are protons).



"
Kumasen jumɛn tɛ warakuluw ɲɛfɔ kaɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Cɛ ni muso bɛɛ ka surun ɲɔgɔn na**.

Here's why:

The text describes how warawakuluw (war chiefs) used to raid and take captives. It then asks *why* they did this. The text explicitly states: ""Musomanw kɛ kadi ka fara ɲɔkɔn kan, bawo u ye balimanmuso ni denmuso'duba ye."" This translates to ""The people were forced to fight, as a result of the war chiefs and their soldiers."" This implies the captives were taken as a consequence of the conflict and used for forced labor or as a form of tribute/sacrifice.  Option C, ""Cɛ ni muso bɛɛ ka surun ɲɔgɔn na"" (The land and the people were subjugated/enslaved), best captures this meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U kɛwalew ni wulukuluw ta ye kelen ye** (It was a religious and spiritual practice): While there *might* have been religious elements involved, the text focuses on the economic and political motivations behind the raids.
* **B: Cɛ ni muso ka gɛrɛ ɲɔgɔnna tɛ te** (The land and the people were poor): The text describes a powerful war chief, suggesting the land and people were not poor.
* **D: U bi fakali kɛ ani hadamadenya** (It was a custom and a tradition): While raids might have become a tradition, the text highlights the forceful nature of the practice.



"

Here's why:

* **The text describes a situation where a ""waraw"" (a type of community leader) is acting unfairly, prioritizing their own people (musoman) in accessing resources (kuluba - likely a resource like water or land) over others.**  The waraw is using their position to benefit their own kin.
* **Option C directly reflects this:** ""A cɛman n’a musoman bɛɛ bɛ fagali kɛ kosɛbɛ ka ɲɛsin fɛn minɛtaw man"" translates to ""The waraw's own people are favored in accessing resources that should be available to everyone.""  This accurately captures the injustice described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U ka jɛɲɔgɔnya ka bon kosɛbɛ (It's a community leader who is good at decision-making).** This is the *opposite* of what the text describes. The waraw is acting badly, not making good decisions.
* **B: U kɛwale bɛ se ka suma ni bakɔlɔwulu ta ye (It's a situation where the community leader is prioritizing their own people and their families).** While the text mentions prioritizing their own people, this option doesn't specifically address the injustice of that prioritization and the unfair allocation of resources.
* **D: U kɛwalew bɔli kungo waraw tɔw fɛ (It's a situation where the community leader is just like the waraw and acting in their own interest).** This option is too broad and doesn't highlight the unfairness. The text isn't saying the waraw is acting according to their role, but rather abusing it.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and comprehensive answer to the question of why the waraw's actions are problematic.



"
Zɔzanw ye ɲiminiwaraw jumɛn ka dumunifɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Waranifitiniw**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Zɔzanw ye ɲiminiwaraw jumɛn ka dumunifɛn ye?"" which translates to ""Who are the creatures that are the offspring of the water and the land?"".

The text states: ""...waranifitiniw (k'a fara ɲiminawaraw kan) munuw bɛ ka yɔrɔjan dumunimisɛn caama dun i n'a fɔ fɛn misɛniw, bagan misɛniw, basaw, ani kɔnɔw."" 

This translates to ""...water-creatures (which originate from the water) are the offspring of the water and the land, and they give birth to fish, birds, reptiles, and mammals.""

Therefore, **waranifitiniw (water-creatures)** are the creatures that are the offspring of water and land.



"

This translates to: ""Warafitiniw (as soon as the rain starts) use the water to make things like **pottery**, baskets, tools, and other things.""

Therefore, the question ""Warafitiniw ka telin ka sogo jumɛn de fɛlɛ ninnu cɛla?"" which means ""What do the waranifitiniw make from the water?"" has the answer **Bagan misɛnninw** (pottery).

The text states: ""Jakumawaraw b'u ka sogo yala ka to k'a yɛrɛ doko u kɛrɛfɛlaw la ka sɔrɔ k'i pan a ka sogo nɔfɛ."" This translates to: ""They (jakumawaraw) can come and take it (something), or they can take it to the place where the chief is, and they will take it with a respectful greeting.""

The question asks ""Ninnu jumɛn tɛ jakumawara ka fɛlɛli fɛɛrɛ kɔnɔ?"" which translates to ""What does it take for the jakumawaraw to be happy?"" The text indicates that presenting the item to the chief is a way to make them happy. Option A, ""K'a yɛrɛ doko u kɛrɛfɛlaw la"" which means ""to take it to the place where the chief is"" is the most direct answer based on the provided text.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sokow kasa nɔndoli** (Respectful greeting) - While a respectful greeting is part of the process, it's not the *thing* they take to make them happy.
*   **C: Sokow dɛndɛli sufɛ** (Something that is beautiful and new) - The text doesn't explicitly state that the item has to be beautiful or new.
*   **D: Dumunimisɛnw dɔrɔn dunni** (Good words of the chief) - Good words are part of the greeting, but not the primary action that makes them happy.

* **The passage states:** ""Jakumawaraw b'u ka sogo yala ka to k'a yɛrɛ doko u kɛrɛfɛlaw la ka sɔrɔ k'i pan a ka sogo nɔfɛ."" This translates to ""The people are looking for a solution to make it [the problem] disappear.""
* **Option A:** ""U bɛ se ka sogow yala sufɛ ka ɲɛ"" translates to ""It is said that a solution is being sought."" This directly reflects the passage's core idea.
* **Options B, C, and D:**  These options are not supported by the passage. The passage focuses on the *search* for a solution, not on specific *types* of solutions, the *cause* of the problem, or the *responsibility* of the government.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate summary of what the passage is saying."
Nin fɛnw jumɛn tɛ jate jaraminɛjara ka sew dɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka kule**.

The text states: ""jaraminɛjara kulekan tɛ bɔ kosɛbɛ i m:a waraba ta, nka i n'a fɔ kumasen dɔ ŋunukan, kumaden dɔw fɔlen ka yɛlɛ.""

This translates to: ""The species of big cats are characterized by: being carnivores, and having sharp teeth and claws for hunting.""

Therefore, the question ""Nin fɛnw jumɛn tɛ jate jaraminɛjara ka sew dɔ ye?"" (What is the food that big cats eat?) is answered by ""Ka kule"" (Carnivores).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛnw jumɛn bɛ danfara do jaraminɛjaraw ni warabaw cɛ?","The correct answer is **B: U kulekan** (It is carnivorous).

Here's why:

* Therefore, the question asks about the type of food lions eat, and the text directly states they are carnivorous.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U ka nɔnni se** (It is herbivorous): This is the opposite of what the text states. Herbivores eat plants.
* **C: U ka panni paara hakɛ** (It is a fruit eater): While lions *might* eat fruit occasionally, their primary diet is meat.
* **D: U ka samani fanga** (It is a grain eater):  This is also incorrect. Grains are plant-based foods.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Robert Hooke balofɛnw kalanba dɔ kabɔ Angiletɛri, ye fan naaniw ye jirifara kɔnɔna jila nin mikorɔsikɔpu ye."" This translates to ""Robert Hooke looked at a microscope he made in England, and he saw cells and microorganisms.""

* **The question asks:** ""What did Robert Hooke observe when he looked at the microscope?""

* **Therefore, the answer is:** He observed cells (fan naaniw).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Farikolobɔn salenw lajɛ (Cells in the air):** The passage doesn't say he saw cells *in the air*. He saw them within the specimen he was observing.
* **B: Ka mikorɔsikɔpu kɛ ka fɛnɲɛnama dɔ lajɛ (Microscope that can magnify things):** While he used a microscope, the question is about what he *saw* with it, not the microscope's function.
* **D: Yelikɛ balo fɛn bɛla fitiniw nafan ma la (It's a kind of thing that is a fitiniw nafan ma):** This is a nonsensical option and not related to the passage.



"
“Farikolobɔn” daɲɛ bɔra mina o kɔrɔ ye mun ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Fan naanifitiniw**.

The text states: ""Farikolobɔn ye balo fɛn bɛla fitiniw nafan ma ye."" This translates to ""Cells are the building blocks of living things.""  ""Nafan ma ye"" means ""that make up"".  Therefore, ""fan naanifitiniw"" (building blocks) is the most accurate description of what a cell is according to the text.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, baganw caman bɛ se ka mun ni mun kɛ ?","The correct answer is **A: Pani**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes various types of bamboo:**  mediyisi (medicine), misalila (cooking), nzɛbɛn t'ula (weaving).
* **The question asks what bamboo is used for:** ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, baganw caman bɛ se ka mun ni mun kɛ?"" translates to ""What are the uses of bamboo?""
* **The passage states:** ""Bagan be sɔrɔ dugukolo fan bɛ fɛ. U be dugukolo sen, ko kɔkɔla, ani ka pan sankolola."" This translates to ""Bamboo is used for building houses. It is used for pillars, beams, and for making furniture.""
* **""Pani"" (building)** is the most encompassing and accurate answer based on the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Taama (Food):** While bamboo can *contain* food (like bamboo shoots), the passage doesn't primarily focus on bamboo as a food source.
* **Nɔnni (Cloth):**  While some bamboo can be used for weaving, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a primary use.
* **Senni (Tool):** While bamboo can be *part* of a tool, it's not the primary function described in the passage.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun fɛn tɛ bagan dɔw la?","The correct answer is **A: Farikolobɔn**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baganw dilan neno nin farikolobɔnda camaw ye."" which translates to ""Baganw are the children of the rainbow.""  The question asks what the children of the rainbow are called.  The answer, according to the text, is ""Farikolobɔnda"".



"
Mun bɛ falenfɛnw dɛmɛ photosynthese baara kɛli la?,"The correct answer is **C: Dumuni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Falenfɛnw bɛ u dumuni tile fɛ photosynthese fɛ."" This translates to ""Falenfɛnw uses sunlight for photosynthesis.""  The word ""dumuni"" means ""sunlight.""

Therefore, the question ""Mun bɛ falenfɛnw dɛmɛ photosynthese baara kɛli la?"" (What does falenfɛnw use for photosynthesis?) is answered by ""Dumuni"" (sunlight).
"
Mɔgɔw bɛ mun bila ka bɔ fiyɛn fɛ ni falenfɛnw b'o sama?,"The correct answer is **D: Dioxide de carbone**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""falenfɛnw bɛ oxygene dilan mɔgɔw bɛ munuw saman, ani u bɛ dioxyde de carbone ta mɔgɔw bɛ munuw bila ka bɔ...""  This translates to: ""plants take in oxygen from the air, and they take in carbon dioxide from the air...""  The question asks what humans exhale (bila ka bɔ) that plants use.  The passage directly states plants use carbon dioxide.
"

Here's why:

The passage states that when a ""jamakilitini"" (a type of fraud) is discovered, it's found that the fraudster has been using a ""jamakuluba"" (a type of scam/fraud).  Option B directly reflects this relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jama fitini dɔ ka dɛsɛ yiriwalila yɔrɔ kura dɔ la:** While ""yiriwalila yɔrɔ kura"" (a type of fraud) is involved, the passage emphasizes the link *between* the ""jamakilitini"" and the ""jamakuluba"".
*   **C: Jamakulu dɔ k’a ka lahala bɛrɛbɛn a yɛrɛ ka yɔrɔ kura la:**  This is too specific. The passage doesn't state that a ""jamakuluba"" *always* involves a ""yɔrɔ kura"" (fraudulent activity).
*   **D: A bɛ se ka kɛ jamakulu dɔ bɛ kɛ fila ye:** This is not supported by the passage. The text describes the use of jamakuluba for fraudulent activities, not simply a type of deception.

Ninnu kumasen jumɛn tɛ siyakurabɔ baara bugunnatigɛ ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛn? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ale bɛ kɛ waati min jama kulu kura dɛsɛra ka deli yɔrɔ kura la.**

Here's why:

The text states that the reason for the increase in the number of cybercriminals is because they are using new techniques to steal information. This directly aligns with option A, which says that cybercriminals are using new techniques to steal data.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ale ye fɛn ye min jɔyɔrɔ ka bon ɲɛlɛmanin baara la:** This option talks about the criminals being skillful, which is a general statement and not the specific reason for the increase.
*   **C: A bɛ kuma fɛnɲɛnɛma kuraw dɔ dilani kan:** This option is not related to the content of the text.
*   **D: A kɛli tɛ se ka bali:** This option means they are being arrested, which is not the cause of the increase in cybercriminals.

Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately reflects the reason provided in the text for the rise in cybercrime.



"
Farikolo yɔrɔ jumɛn jɔyɔrɔ ye ka jɔli se dusukun na?,"The correct answer is **A: Jɔlisirakumabaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jɔli bɛ dusukun na siraw fɛ n'u bɛ wele jɔlisirakumabaw ni ka segin sɔnkun kɔnɔ siraw fɛ n'a bɛ f'u ma jɔlisiradeniw.""  This translates to ""The things (jɔli) are made of a material that is used to make jɔlisirakumabaw, and that material is also used to make jɔlisiradeniw.""

Therefore, the question asks what the things (jɔli) are made of. The passage directly states that they are made of **jɔlisirakumabaw**.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jɔlisiraniw:**  The passage says jɔlisiradeniw is *made* of the material, not the other way around.
* **C: Farikolo yɔrɔw:** This refers to Farikolo's child, not the material.
* **D: Jɔlisiradeniw:**  Again, jɔlisiradeniw is made of the material, not the other way around.



"
Jolisiraw jumɛn de ka dɔgɔ ni farikolo jolisiraw bɛɛ ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Jɔlisiradeniw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""jɔli bɛ dusukun na siraw fɛ n'u bɛ wele jɔlisirakumabaw ni ka segin sɔnkun kɔnɔ siraw fɛ n'a bɛ f'u ma jɔlisiradeniw.""  This translates to something like: ""The beautiful ones are also born from the heart and are made by the beautiful women according to the truth of their heart, and they are given to the beautiful people as beautiful daughters.""

* **The question asks:** ""Jolisiraw jumɛn de ka dɔgɔ ni farikolo jolisiraw bɛɛ ye?""  This translates to ""What is the name of the beautiful people to which the heart's beautiful daughters belong?""

* **The passage explicitly says the beautiful daughters are given ""to the beautiful people as beautiful daughters.""** Therefore, the ""beautiful people"" are referred to as **jɔlisiradeniw**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jɔlisiraw (Beautiful ones):** This is too general. It refers to the daughters themselves, not the people who receive them.
* **B: Jɔlisirakumabaw (Beautiful women):** The passage mentions beautiful women *making* the daughters, but it doesn't identify the recipients of the daughters as beautiful women.
* **D: Farikolo yɔrɔw (Heart's people):**  While the daughters are made from the heart, this option doesn't fit the context of who *receives* the daughters.



"
Fɛnɲɛnɛmaniw ka kamaw kuruli se bɛ faranka kɛ fɛnw jumɛnna ninnu cɛla?,"The correct answer is **A: Dumuni maralen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fɛnɲɛnɛmaniw cama bolo k'u kamaw kuru kana u farikolola. O b'a to u be seka dogo yɔrɔw camana kabɔ fɛnɲɛnɛmani minɛnaw ma.""  This translates to: ""The information can help to improve the cycle of learning and self-improvement. It is said to be a large amount of knowledge that can be found in the information."" 

The question asks: ""What is the source of the information in the cycle of learning?"" This means where does the information *come from* that fuels the cycle.

The text indicates that the information comes from **people** (dumuni) who are constantly learning and sharing. Therefore, ""Dumuni maralen"" (people constantly learning) is the most appropriate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yɔrɔw dogoli** (Old people): While old people can be sources of information, the text emphasizes the ongoing and continuous nature of the knowledge source.
*   **C: Tɔɲɔngɔnw ɲinini** (Very knowledgeable people): Similar to old people, the text doesn't focus solely on extremely knowledgeable individuals but on the broader pool of people contributing.
*   **D: Panni teliya** (Written texts): The text doesn't primarily refer to written documents, but to a wider range of sources and continuous learning.



"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen ma fɔ tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ n’o be dankari kɛ fɛnɲɛnɛmani dɔ panni fanga la?,"The correct answer is **C: Dumuni faraɲɔgɔnkan**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the main reason why the people are grateful for the arrival of the Fennec foxes?
* **The text states:** ""Awantazi be fɛnɲɛnɛmaniw cama bolo k'u kamaw kuru kana u farikolola."" This translates to ""It is known that the Fennec foxes help to protect the crops and scare away pests.""  This directly links the gratitude to the foxes' protective abilities.
* **Dumuni faraɲɔgɔnkan** translates to ""their usefulness.""  This is the best fit as it summarizes the primary reason for the gratitude - they are useful in protecting the crops.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ɲɛnɛmaya janya** (Their beauty): While Fennec foxes might be considered beautiful, the text doesn't emphasize beauty as the reason for gratitude.
* **A: Bange** (Nothing): This is completely wrong, as the text clearly states there's a reason for gratitude.
* **D: Ɲumanya** (Their cleverness):  The text mentions their ability to scare away pests, but doesn't highlight cleverness as the *main* reason for gratitude.  Usefulness is a broader and more accurate descriptor.



"
Nin taamasiyɛn jumɛn kelen tɛ ɲagamin dinozɔriw la?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka taama kɔfɛ sen fila kan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fara b'u sen na ani si jan b'ula ani sɔniw, u be fan da, ani u be tama u kɔfɛ senw fila kan inafɔ T-Rex dɔ."" This translates to: ""Because humans and animals have existed for a long time, they have created a sculpture that looks like the T-Rex."" 
* **The question asks:** ""Nin taamasiyɛn jumɛn kelen tɛ ɲagamin dinozɔriw la?"" which translates to ""What is the sculpture that resembles the dinosaur?""
* **Option A:** ""Ka taama kɔfɛ sen fila kan"" translates to ""It's a sculpture made of stone."" This directly answers the question based on the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Siw** (Wood) - The passage mentions stone, not wood.
* **C: Fanda** (Bone) - While dinosaurs are made of bone, the passage refers to a *sculpture*, not actual dinosaur bones.
* **D: Sennɔ** (Cloth) - There's no mention of cloth in the passage.



"
Nin jumɛn kelen tɛ jate kosɛbɛba i bɛ a fɔ ko kɔnɔw ni dinozɔruw ka bɛɛjɛ taamasiɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka se kan pan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mɔgɔ camaw tɛ mir'u la inafɔ dinozɔruw bari si b'ula ani u be pan."" This translates to ""People have found many bones of dinosaurs and they are pieced together.""
* **The question asks:** ""What is it that people have put together to create the image of dinosaurs?"" This is asking what people have assembled from the bones.
* **Option C directly answers this:** ""Ka se kan pan"" means ""They are pieced together.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fanda** means ""False."" The passage describes the process of piecing bones together.
* **B: Ka taama kɔfɛ senw fila kan** means ""They are put together with some thread."" While thread might be used, the core action is piecing the bones.
* **D: Sen sɔnni maw** means ""Ancient stories."" The passage is about the physical remains of dinosaurs, not stories about them.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, a tun kɛlen inafɔ Triceratope tun be se ka cycades fan jumɛn dun?","The correct answer is **B: Yiriju**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""o yiri ni bɔlen do ntensunfitini fɛ ni ɲɔni da dumanw, furabulu nunjanw ye.""  This translates to ""it ate plants and animals, ferns and cycads."" Therefore, triceratops ate cycads (yiriju).



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, a tun kɛlen inafɔ Triceratope tun be se ka cycades fan jumɛn dun ka tɛmɛ a fan tɔw bɛɛ kan? ","The correct answer is **C: Sɔlɔni dɔ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ɲininikɛla wɛrɛw ko baka bɛ o jiri nunu la ola dinosaure si kun tɛ o dun, ali n'a sɔrɔ njɛw ni bakan wɛrɛw i n'a fɔ sɔlɔni (dinosaures bɔnsɔn) bɛ jiribuluw ni jiridenw bakaman dun.""

This translates to: ""The herbivores were like the other dinosaurs that lived at that time, and they were followed by groups of predators (carnivorous dinosaurs) that fed on herbivorous dinosaurs.""

The question asks *what* the Triceratops ate, and the text indicates they ate **cucades** which were the food source for the **herbivorous dinosaurs** (sɔlɔni). Therefore, the Triceratops ate the same thing as the herbivorous dinosaurs, and the herbivorous dinosaurs ate the cycades.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Njɛw dɔ (Predators):**  The text says predators ate *Triceratops*, not the other way around.
*   **B: Jiribolokolojalen dɔ (Paleontologists):** Paleontologists study dinosaurs, but the text isn't asking *who* studied the dinosaurs; it's asking *what* the dinosaurs ate.
*   **D: Baga be jiri min denw na (Something else):** The text clearly identifies what the Triceratops (and other herbivorous dinosaurs) ate - cycades.

"
"Ka kaɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, farikoloɲɛnajɛ jumɛn dɔnnenba do Itali jamana worodugu yanfan fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Ntolantan (Football)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Farikoloɲɛnajɛ dɔnnenbaaw ye ntolatan..."" which translates to ""The most popular sports in Italy are football...""  The text goes on to list other sports, but football is presented as the most popular.
"
"Ka da kunnafoni dilen kan tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, nin farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ jumɛn kelen ye Diyɛn Ntolantan jɔjɔn ta Itali?","The correct answer is **A: Ntolantan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Farikoloɲɛnajɛ dɔnnenbaaw ye ntolatan..."" which translates to ""The most popular sports in Italy are football (ntolantan)..."".  Therefore, the most popular sport in Italy is football (ntolantan).
"

The text states: ""Luxembourg y'a ɲini waati bɛɛ la ka to a ka fasabaliya kɔnɔ nka a tun minɛ na Alimakɛlɛfɔlɔ ni filana na Alimaɲi fɛ."" This translates to ""Luxembourg was forced to sign a treaty and became a protectorate of Germany.""  ""Alimakɛlɛfɔlɔ"" is the word for protectorate in this context.

Therefore, Luxembourg became a protectorate of Germany, not of Belgian people or the European Community.
"
Nin fɛn kelen jumɛn ye dankari Luxembourg ka fasabaliya la?,"The correct answer is **A: Alimanw ka minɛli**.

The text states: ""Luxembourg y'a ɲini waati bɛɛ la ka to a ka fasabaliya kɔnɔ nka a tun minɛ na Alimakɛlɛfɔlɔ ni filana na Alimaɲi fɛ."" This translates to ""Luxembourg had a long history of neutrality and was occupied by German forces.""  Therefore, Germany occupied Luxembourg.
"
Tiriki dugukolo kilomɛtiri kare joli bɛ Ɛrɔpu kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **B: 755688**.

The text states: ""Tiriki dugukolo, k'a fara dalaw kan, bɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ_kare 783.562 (nɔgɔn_kare ɲɛ 300.948) ta, min cɛma kilomɛtɛrɛ_kare 755.688 (nɔngɔn_kare ɲɛ 291.773) Azi worodugu_tilebinyanfan fɛ."" This translates to: ""The Tiriki dugukolo, after starting to travel, was 783.562 square kilometers (approximately 300.948 square miles), and it reduced to 755.688 square kilometers (approximately 291.773 square miles) by the end of its journey.""

The question asks for the total area of the Tiriki dugukolo in Europe. The text provides the area at the end of its journey as 755.688 square kilometers. This is the most relevant area given in the text related to its presence in Europe.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Tiriki janya be taa nɔngɔn ɲɛ joli ɲɔgɔnw la?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The passage states: ""Tiriki dugukolo bɛ tɛmɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ 1.600 (nɔngɔn ɲɛ 1.000) kan janyan na ani kilomɛtɛrɛ 800 (nɔngɔn ɲɛ 500) kan boɲan na...""

This translates to: ""The duration of the journey is 1,600 kilometers (approximately 1,000 miles) and covers a distance of 800 kilometers (approximately 500 miles) and is completed...""

Therefore, the journey's total distance in kilometers is 1600.

The text states: ""Vatican dugu be italiyɛn kan labaara u ka sariyasun kɔnɔ ani u ka kuma **lasetaw** la."" This translates to ""The Vatican state uses Italian for communication and also uses **Latin**.""
"
"Vatican dugu kɔnɔ, Italiyɛn kan be labaara ka mun kɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Kuma lasetaw**.

The text states: ""Vatican dugu be italiyɛn kan labaara u ka sariyasun kɔnɔ **ani u ka kuma lasetaw la**.""  This translates to ""The Vatican City also has a treaty with Italy concerning security **and also the postal system**.""
"
"Ka kɛnɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn kelen be nafa sɔrɔ dɔngili ɲagamili la ɔridinatɛri ɲuman la?","The correct answer is **A: Dɔngili (Dongili)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dɔngili be anrezirisire waatidɔw nin ɔridinatɛri laban natili ye walasa ka dɔngiliw baara ani k'u faraɲɔgɔn kan."" This translates to: ""Dongili records the movements of a computer and the images displayed on it, and it captures the sounds.""

The question asks what is used to record the movements of a computer and the images displayed on it. The passage explicitly identifies **dongili** as the device that performs this function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Animasiyɔnw (Animations)**: Animations *are* displayed on the computer, but they aren't the recording device.
*   **C: Fotow (Photos)**: Photos can be *captured* by a computer, but they aren't the primary recording mechanism mentioned.
*   **D: Dilani (Dilani - likely referring to ""dilani"" meaning ""screens"")**: Screens *display* the images, not record them.

Therefore, **dongili** is the only option that accurately answers the question based on the provided text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsiran in ye, nɔkɔsamanɲɛkɛn tun be yɔrɔ sow fanbaw kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""nɔkɔsamanɲɛkɛn dɔ bɛ Harappa ni Mohenjo-daro so kelen-kelenna rilankɛ bɛɛ kɔnɔ..."" This translates to ""The Indus seals were found in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro...""

The question asks where the Indus seals were found.  Therefore, the correct answer is Mohenjo-daro.
"
Ninnu yɔrɔ jumɛnw kelen na jinɔkɔ sariŋa sistɛmu sɔrɔ la ?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The text states: ""nɔkɔsamanɲɛkɛn dɔ bɛ Harappa ni Mohenjo-daro so kelen-kelenna rilankɛ bɛɛ kɔnɔ..."" which translates to ""the script found on Harappa and Mohenjo-daro...""

Therefore, Harappa is directly mentioned as a place where the script was found. The other options are mentioned as places where the script *wasn't* found or where it had influences, but not as the original location.
"
Ninnu jumɛnw kelen bɛ sanbɛlɛbolikɛla bila ka fara?,"The correct answer is **B: Dakunfila minnuw bɛ sanbɛlɛbolinɛgɛ la**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Dakunfila bɛ sanbɛlɛbolinɛgɛ la digankurulen bɛ munu ni ɲɔkɔn cɛ."" This translates to ""The day is filled with the sounds of children's laughter and singing.""

* **The question asks:** ""Ninnu jumɛnw kelen bɛ sanbɛlɛbolikɛla bila ka fara?""  This translates to ""What makes the sounds of laughter and singing begin?""

* **The answer B: Dakunfila minnuw bɛ sanbɛlɛbolinɛgɛ la**  translates to ""The day is filled with the sounds of children's laughter and singing."" This directly reflects the initial statement about the source of the sounds.  It's not *what* makes them start, but *what* they are.  This is a trick question. It asks what *makes* the sounds start, but the text only tells us *what the sounds are*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tikɛyɔrɔ fitini min bɛ sanbɛlɛbolinɛgɛ kɔfɛla lan:** This translates to ""The bright sun that shines on the sounds of children's laughter."" While the sun might be present, the text doesn't say it *makes* the laughter start.  It's an unnecessary detail.
* **C: Sanbɛlɛbolila ka dɔniya hakɛ:** This translates to ""The music that comes from the village."" The text doesn't specify that the music comes from the village, or that the sounds *begin* from the music.
* **D: Sanbɛlɛ ɲa:** This translates to ""Laughter."" While laughter is *part* of the sounds, the question asks what makes *all* the sounds of laughter and singing begin, not just laughter alone.




Therefore, **B** is the most appropriate answer, even though the question is slightly misleading. The text establishes the *source* of the sounds and option B directly references that source.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn kelen bɛ sisan sanbɛlɛbolinɛgɛ digɛn bugunatigɛ ka ɲɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Dakunfilama**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the process of fermentation (sanbɛlɛbolinɛgɛ). It states that fermentation is carried out by microorganisms (dakunfila) that consume sugars and produce gases (like carbon dioxide). 

The question asks what is responsible for the fermentation process. The passage explicitly states: ""Dakunfila bɛ sanbɛlɛw famuya ka ɲɛ..."" which translates to ""Microorganisms carry out fermentation and produce gas..."".  Therefore, the microorganisms (dakunfila) are responsible.

**Dakunfilama** (the plural of dakunfila) refers to microorganisms or bacteria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Kurulen:** This refers to fermentation itself (the process).
* **Kuru:**  This means ""to ferment"" (the verb).
* **Jɛgɛnnen:** This means ""to ripen"" or ""to mature"".



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsiran in ye, lafilili juman kelen b’a to kisɛniw bɛ funtɛnikurafarankan labɔ u ye mun be sɔrɔ yeelen fɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Photons Lafililidiyagoyalen**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *kind* of particles are the ""lafililijagoyalen"" (which translates to something like ""light particles"") that are mentioned as being emitted by stars. The text explicitly states: ""ja wɛrɛ bɛ kisɛniw jira min bɛ ka photons fili. ka sikanan bɛ bɔ a la, tuɲanna photons ka dɔkɔ kojuku ka tɛmɛ ja taw kan. Photons ka dɔkɔ fɛnɛ ni fɛnmisɛni munuw bɛ kɛ kisɛniw ye!""  This translates to: ""These are particles that emit photons. These particles are small and move very fast. The photons are small and have energy!""

The text then refers to these photons as ""lafililijagoyalen"" and clarifies they are ""photon yeelen fili"" (emitted photons).  Therefore, ""lafililidiyagoyalen"" refers to photons.

Option B, ""Photons Lafililidiyagoyalen,"" is the best fit because it directly connects the light particles (lafililijagoyalen) to their fundamental nature as photons.  Options A and C are too general. Option D repeats ""Lafililidiyagoyalen"" without the crucial connection to photons.

Therefore, **B: Photons Lafililidiyagoyalen** is the most accurate and complete answer.
"
Mun de be kisɛni bila photon dɔ fili la?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka funtenikurafarankan labɔ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""u ka kan ka u funtenikurafaralen de labɔ u ye min sɔrɔ yeelen fɛ."" This translates to ""It is said that the fundamental particles are the ones that make up everything.""  The question asks what fundamental particle makes up everything. Therefore, the answer is ""Ka funtenikurafarankan labɔ"" which means ""Fundamental particles"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jagoyalabɔli yeelenjɛlen fɛ** - This translates to ""particles of light"". While photons *are* particles of light, the passage is asking about the *fundamental* particles that make up everything, not just light particles.
*   **C: Funteni kundama basigibali** - This translates to ""fundamental matter"". While related, the passage's focus is on the ""fundamental particles"" themselves.
*   **D: Labɔli balili** - This translates to ""simple particles"".  While photons are simple, the passage points to a more basic level of particles.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de bɛ laban ka yeelenbarani ban baara ma?","The correct answer is **A: Yeelenbarani minnanw fagabaliya ka ɲɛ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""yeelenmɛnɛnna ka kan ka bɔ a la walema tasumajuru ka bɔn."" (They [the people] are looking for a healer who can heal.) This implies a need for healing.

The question asks: ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de bɛ laban ka yeelenbarani ban baara ma?"" (What is the reason for this need, so that they seek out healers?)

The text then says: ""o kɛkun ye tasuma min bɛ woni kɔnɔ yeelenbaraninɛgɛ bɛ sigi yɔrɔ minna bɛ se ka i jɛnni kɔsɛbɛn n'i makara woni walema yeelenbaraninɛgɛju la k'a fan dɔ sɔrɔ woni kɔnɔ."" (It is because the disease that the people are suffering from is a disease that healers have experience in treating, and they are looking for a healer who can cure it.)

This confirms that people seek healers *because* they are suffering from a disease.  Therefore, the reason for seeking healers is **they are sick (fagabaliya ka ɲɛ)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka yeelenbarani nɛgɛmanyɔrɔ tilancɛ dɔrɔn don woni la** (Because healers have some special medicine). The text doesn't mention special medicine.
* **C: Yeelenbarani kɔnɔjurunin jenin** (Healers are just people). While technically true, it doesn't explain *why* they are sought out.
* **D: Kuran bolita woni kɔnɔ o lasumayali** (Because the disease is spread by a certain insect). The text doesn't mention a disease spread by insects.



"
Ninnu jumɛn de be se ka kɛ farati fɛn ye n’i magar’a la kuma min i bɛka yeelenbarani falen?,"The correct answer is **B: Yeelenmɛnɛnnan**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Yeelenmɛnɛnna ka kan ka bɔ a la walema tasumajuru ka bɔn."" This translates to ""The elders are the ones who raise up the community by teaching them morals.""
* **The question asks:** ""Who are the ones who teach the community morals?""
* **Therefore, ""Yeelenmɛnɛnnan"" (the elders) is the correct answer.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A kɔnɔ juruni (The religious leaders):** While religious leaders might influence morality, the text specifically focuses on the role of elders.
* **C: Yeelenbaraninɛgɛ (The morals/ethics):** This refers to the subject matter, not the people who impart those morals.
* **D: Nɛgɛjuru (The children):** The text states the elders *raise up* the community, implying a teaching role, not the children themselves being the primary teachers.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de bɛ kɛ ni camancɛ dɔ cira?","The correct answer is **D: Netɔrɔnw bilala (Electrons)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Atomu dɔw camancɛla jɔlen tɛ min kɔrɔ ye k'u be seka ci kabɔ ɲɔgɔna nin ɲɔndili fitini walima ɲɔntili foyisi ye."" This translates to: ""The atom's nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons, and it is surrounded by clouds of electrons that are constantly moving in a complex way.""

Therefore, the electrons are the particles that orbit the nucleus (made of protons and neutrons) and are responsible for the chemical behavior of the atom.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ yɔrɔjan weleli jira ka ɲɛ min be segin ka jigin Dugukolo kan,"The correct answer is **B: Satellites**.

Here's why:

The passage describes satellites as being used to observe the universe (""k'a kɛ satellite fɛ"" - ""it is a satellite""), to take pictures of distant objects (""filikurun dɔ fɛ"" - ""pictures of distant objects""), and to help scientists study the universe (""bɛ weleli ta k'a fili ka segin o yɔrɔ ni bɛ"" - ""they are used to take pictures and follow their orbits""). The question asks what is used to observe the universe and study the cosmos.  Satellites are explicitly mentioned as the tools for this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Telesikɔpuw (Telescopes):** While telescopes *are* used to observe the universe, the passage focuses on satellites as the primary means for this task in this context.
*   **C: Yeelenw (Stars):** Stars are objects observed in the universe, not tools for observing it.
*   **D: Filikurunw (Pictures):** Pictures are the *result* of observations, not the instruments used for observing.

Therefore, **Satellites** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Ninnu jumɛn de bɛ kɛ telescope bila ka ta sanfɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Dugukolo lahalayaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ɲininikɛlaw bɛ baara kɛ ni telescopes ye sanfɛ bawo dugukolo lahala bɛ anw ka yeelen ni filɛli lafili."" This translates to: ""Scientists use telescopes to observe the stars and galaxies.""

Therefore, the telescopes are used to observe **galaxies**.
"
Mun de k’an ka jate kokɛta kumacama walasa ka waati temɛta jatedɔn?,"The correct answer is **A: Janya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kokɛta kumacama ye fɛn ye min be kɛ tuguni ani tuguni tumabɛla."" This translates to ""The medicine is a cure for sickness and for wounds.""

The question asks: ""Is the medicine a cure for wounds?""

The answer to that question, based on the provided text, is ""yes"" or ""janya"" in the context of the given options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Seginkanni:** This likely means ""no"" or ""not at all"" in the context of the language.
* **C: Nɔ:** This means ""no.""
* **D: Gɛlɛya:** This means ""perhaps"" or ""maybe.""

Therefore, only **Janya (Yes)** aligns with the text's statement that the medicine is a cure for wounds.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kokɛta yɔrɔ jumɛn de bɛ ta ka sanga waati la?","The correct answer is **A: Janya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the characteristics of the ""kokɛta kumacama"" (the sacred tree).** It mentions it's a tree that grows tall and has a strong, unwavering root.  It also emphasizes its importance and the reverence people have for it.
* **The question asks *why* people sing and dance around the sacred tree.**
* **The passage implies that people sing and dance around the tree to show respect and honor it.**  The description of the tree as sacred and the reverence mentioned strongly suggest this connection.  The word ""janya"" (meaning ""respect"" or ""reverence"") is the closest fit to this implied reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Seginkanni (Danger):**  The passage doesn't suggest the tree is dangerous.
* **C: Ko kɛlenw (It is not):** This is a negative answer, and the passage strongly implies *something* is done around the tree.
* **D: Nɔ (No):** This is also a negative answer and doesn't align with the passage's description of reverence.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni temɛsira in ye, a jatelen don ko ninnu jumɛn de bɛ se ka kɛ tiɲɛtabaga ye ka ɲɛsin masasigilan ma?","The correct answer is **A: Kunnawolosɛbɛn 2:2 sɔrɔli**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Charles tun ye Biritaniki Masa Bɔnda mɔgɔ fɔlɔfɔlɔ ye ka kunnawolosɛbɛn dɔ sɔrɔ.""  This translates to ""Charles is a very famous British historian who studied History (2:2 honors degree).""

The question asks what Charles studied. The passage explicitly states he studied the **kunnawolosɛbɛn dɔ sɔrɔ**, which means the **History degree (2:2 honors degree)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Banni sanfɛ kalanso taali ma ka don kɛlɛbolo la** (The college where he studied is a very prestigious one): While true, this doesn't directly answer *what* he studied.
* **C: Tariku kalanni** (History degree): This is a rephrasing of the correct answer, but option A is the more precise and complete response given the wording of the options.
* **D: Taali sanfɛkalanso la ka kɔn donni ɲɛ kɛlɛbolo la** (The college where he studied is very famous): Same reason as option B.



Therefore, **Kunnawolosɛbɛn 2:2 sɔrɔli** is the most accurate and directly supported answer."
"Ka da kunnafoni dilen kan temɛsira in kɔnɔ, Charles kɛra mɔgɔ fɔlɔ ye ka mun kɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Kunnawolosɛbɛn dɔ sɔrɔli**.

Here's why:

The text states that Charles studied History to a 2:2 level (which is a degree classification).  The question asks what Charles studied.  The text explicitly says he studied ""Tariku ni 2:2 sɔrɔli ye,"" which translates to ""History to a 2:2 level.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka don kɛlɛbolo la ka kɔn kalan banni ɲɛ** - This translates to ""That he is a very successful person who has achieved a high position"". While Charles is successful, the text focuses on his *studies*, not his success.
* **B: Ka Arikeyolozi kalan** - This translates to ""That he studied Archaeology"".  The text states he studied History, not Archaeology.
* **D: Ka taa College Trinity la** - This translates to ""That he attended Trinity College"". While he *did* attend Trinity College, the question asks what he studied, not where he studied.



"
Trygvasson ka kurunw bɔra jamana jumɛn na?,"The correct answer is **D: Nɔriwɛzi (Norway)**.

The passage states: ""Mbũtũ ĩno yatongoretio nĩ Olaf Trygvasson, wa kuma Norway..."" which translates to ""This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, from Norway...""
"
Tariku waati jumɛn na Alimaɲi ka taabolo nɔba bilala Ɛsitoni jamana na?,"The passage states: ""San kɛmɛ sigiyɔrɔma 15na yɔrɔw la, worodugu Ɛsitoni tun be Alimaɲi seko ni dɔnko taabolo la kɔsɛbɛ."" This translates to: ""15 years after the death of the king, in the city of Ɛsitoni, the Alimaɲi (chief) sat at a table.""

Then it says: ""Alimaɲikaw ka batokɛla dɔw tun be fɛ ka Ala surunya mɔgɔw la, ola u ye Ɛsitoni kan gɛrɛgɛrɛ in dilan."" This means: ""The chief then prayed to God for the people, that they might be prosperous in Ɛsitoni.""

And: ""A tun b'a sinsin Alimaɲi kan siginidenw kan wa siginiden dɔ """"Õ/õ"""" farala a kan.""  This means: ""And the chief, with a smile, gave a gift to those who came to him.""

Finally: ""Ni waati tɛmɛli ye, kanɲɛ caman minnuw singala Alimaɲi kan fɛ ɲagamin'a la. O kɛra Yeelen waati daminɛ ye"" This means: ""And in the end, the people rejoiced greatly at the Alimaɲi's generosity. The story of this is well known.""

The question asks: ""Tariku waati jumɛn na Alimaɲi ka taabolo nɔba bilala Ɛsitoni jamana na?"" which translates to: ""On what date did the Alimaɲi sit at the table in Ɛsitoni?""

The passage says the Alimaɲi sat at the table **15 years after the death of the king**.  The passage *doesn't* state the king's death date. Therefore, we cannot determine the date from the provided information.

However, the options give dates in 'yanfan' (years). Assuming 'yanfan' refers to years after a certain point, and that the question is asking how many years *after* the king's death the Alimaɲi sat at the table, then the information given in the passage is: the Alimaɲi sat at the table 15 years after the king's death.  None of the answer choices reflect this value. 

The question is flawed, the answer cannot be derived from the information provided and none of the answer choices correlate to the data given.

**Because the question cannot be accurately answered, I cannot provide a selection.**
"
Mun de ye nɔ ba bila Ɛsitoni kan na?,"The correct answer is **A: Siginniden Õ/õ**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Who did the Chief say?"" (Mun de ye nɔ ba bila Ɛsitoni kan na?).

The text states: ""Alimaɲikaw ka batokɛla dɔw tun be fɛ ka Ala surunya mɔgɔw la, ola u ye Ɛsitoni kan gɛrɛgɛrɛ in dilan. A tun b'a sinsin Alimaɲi kan siginidenw kan wa siginiden dɔ """"Õ/õ"""" farala a kan.""

This translates to: ""The Chief spoke to the people, saying that Allah had sent the prophet to Ɛsitoni, and he had called for the Chief's servant to say the words ""Õ/õ"".""

Therefore, the Chief said **""Õ/õ""** (Siginniden Õ/õ).

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ minnu fakan ye Hindi ye olu bɛ falen ka da fɛn jumɛn de kan?","The correct answer is **C: Mɔgɔ minnu bɛ kan famu n’olu bɛ ka jate** (People have been living and speaking Hindi and Urdu for a long time).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hindi kan ni Urudu kan daɲɛw ye kelen ye nka u sɛbɛncogo te kelen ye don o don kumaw la..."" (Hindi and Urdu are ancient languages that have been used for a long time...)
* **The question asks:** ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ minnu fakan ye Hindi ye olu bɛ falen ka da fɛn jumɛn de kan?"" (Since ancient times, why have people been speaking Hindi and Urdu?)
* **Option C directly reflects this information.**  The passage explains that Hindi and Urdu have a long history of use, therefore people have been speaking them for a long time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kan bolofara minnu ka surun Hindi la kosɛbɛ n’olu bɛ ka jate** (Bolofara people have been speaking Hindi...) - The passage doesn't specify Bolofara people. It speaks generally about people speaking Hindi and Urdu.
* **B: Ni Urdu fɔlaw bɛ ka jate** (Urdu has been spoken...) -  While true, it doesn't fully answer *why* people have been speaking Hindi and Urdu. The passage provides a broader historical context.
* **D: Mɔgɔ minnu bɛ se ka kan kalan, n’olu be ka jate** (People have been living here, and they have been speaking...) - The passage focuses on the *language* being spoken, not necessarily on people living in a specific place.

Ninnu kumasen jumɛn ye tiɲɛ ye Hindi ni Urdu kanw ka ?,"The correct answer is **C: U ye kelen ye daɲɛw ni sɛbɛnni na (They are a family of languages that are mutually intelligible)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Hindi kan ni Urudu kan daɲɛw ye kelen ye nka u sɛbɛncogo te kelen ye don o don kumaw la...""  This translates to ""Hindi and Urdu are a family of languages that are mutually intelligible, and they have a lot of common words...""
* **Option C accurately reflects this.** It highlights that Hindi and Urdu belong to the same language family and can be understood by speakers of the other.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ka c’a la jɛɲɔgɔnya tigɛ bɛ kan fila ninnu fɔbagaw ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ (They are a family of languages that share the same basic vocabulary and grammar):** While there are similarities in vocabulary and grammar, the text explicitly says they are *mutually intelligible*, which is a stronger connection than just sharing basic features.
* **B: U sɛbɛnniw tɛ kelen ye (They are the same language):** The text clearly states they are *two different* languages (Hindi and Urdu).
* **D: U daɲɛw tɛ kelen ye (They are different languages):** While true, this option doesn't capture the crucial aspect of their relatedness and mutual intelligibility that the text emphasizes.



"
Ninnu jumɛn tɛ tiɲɛ ye Hangeul siginidenw kan?,"The correct answer is **C: A dilanna Joseon Masasi masakɛ naaninan fɛ** (It was created by the Joseon Dynasty's king).

Here's why:

* **The text clearly states:** ""Masa Sejong tun ye Joseon masasi masakɛ naaninan ye, ani ani a jatelen do kosɛbɛ."" which translates to ""King Sejong, during the Joseon Dynasty, dedicated himself to its creation and continued to use it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A dilanna Masakɛ Sejong ka mara daminɛ waati la** (It was created by King Sejong during a long time): While true that King Sejong worked on it for a long time, the text emphasizes his role *during the Joseon Dynasty*.
* **B: Siginiden in tɔgɔ yɛrɛyɛrɛ tun ye Hunan Jeongeum ye** (The creation is based on the Hunmin Jeongeum):  The text mentions the *creation* of Hunmin Jeongeum as a document, but doesn't state that the creation *is based on* it.  The Hunmin Jeongeum *is* the document that explains the creation of Hangeul.
* **D: A laɲini ka dilan de** (It was created by someone): The text explicitly names King Sejong as the creator.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided text."
Hunmin Jeongeum siginiden tun labanna ka falen mun na?,"The correct answer is **A: Sejong**.

The text states: ""Masa Sejong tun ye Joseon masasi masakɛ naaninan ye, ani ani a jatelen do kosɛbɛ."" This translates to ""King Sejong, during the Joseon Dynasty, was a ruler who greatly valued the people and dedicated himself to them.""  It directly links King Sejong to the creation and promotion of Hangeul.

While Hangeul and Jeongeum are related to the question, the text explicitly mentions Sejong's role in creating and implementing them.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Sanskrit ye nɔ bila kan jumɛnw de la?","The correct answer is **B: Erɔpu kanw**.

The text states: ""Sanskrit ye kan kɔrɔba dɔ ye ani a be sanga Latɛn kan fɔta ma Erɔpu."" This translates to ""Sanskrit is a language that was brought to Europe through Latin.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de ye Sanskrit labaarali dɔgɔya?","The correct answer is **C: Latɛn Kan**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sanskrit ye kan kɔrɔba dɔ ye ani a be sanga Latɛn kan fɔta ma Erɔpu."" This translates to: ""Sanskrit is a language that served as a basis for Latin and spread to Europe.""

Therefore, Latin is the language to which Sanskrit is related and influenced.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn ye tiɲɛ ka ɲɛsin lo munumunu cogo ma?","The correct answer is **D: Dugukolo ka munumununi b’i sama kosɛbɛ ka tɛmɛ lo munumununi kan**.

Here's why:

The problem states:

* A person weighs 90 kg, and their bones weigh 16 kg.
* The remaining weight is made up of organs and tissues.

Therefore:

* Total weight = Bones + Organs & Tissues
* 90 kg = 16 kg + Organs & Tissues
* Organs & Tissues = 90 kg - 16 kg = 74 kg

The question asks what makes up the remaining weight (organs and tissues). Option D accurately states that the organs and tissues *compose* the remaining weight.  The other options are incorrect because they suggest the bones or the overall weight are somehow contributing to the organs and tissues.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tasumajisisikuluw camaw be sɔrɔ fan gɛrɛlen na bari kɔfara jalen ka min sen. A kun ka nɔgɔ tasumajima ka yɛrɛ fo sanfɛla la.""  This translates to ""Bicycles often carry many people to and from the forest. It is also possible to use bicycles to go to and from the village.""
* **Option C accurately reflects this:** It highlights the use of bicycles for transportation *to and from the forest*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kɛrɛ gɛrɛlen Kɔfara ka bon (It's that the bicycle is good for carrying people):** While bicycles are good for carrying people, the passage emphasizes their use for *forest* travel.
* **B: Kɔfara ka dɔgɔn legelegew duguma (It's that the bicycle is very fast):** The passage doesn't mention the speed of the bicycles.
* **D: A be se ka kɛ tasumajisisikulu ka dɔgɔn legelegew duguma (It's that the bicycle is very heavy):** The passage doesn't mention the weight of the bicycles.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Kalo kɔfara ka bon kosɛbɛ yɔrɔ jumɛn?","The correct answer is **D: Tasumajisisikulu duguma**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tasumajisisikuluw camaw be sɔrɔ fan gɛrɛlen na bari kɔfara jalen ka min sen."" This translates to ""Bicycles are faster than many vehicles when carrying a lot of cargo.""
* **The question asks:** ""What is the reason why vehicles that carry a lot of cargo use bicycles?"" This means we need to find the reason *why* they choose bicycles.
* **The passage implies:**  People choose bicycles because they are faster than other vehicles when carrying a significant amount of cargo.

Therefore, the answer is that bicycles are faster when carrying a lot of cargo.
"
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, mɔgɔdɔw dalen bɛ jumɛn na?","The correct answer is **B: Adamadenw te se ka diɲɛ wɛrɛw ɲɛɲini** (People are looking for the most valuable things).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that people are constantly seeking something valuable.** It mentions things like desires, ambition, and the relentless pursuit of wealth.  The phrase ""mɔgɔw dɔw b'u yɛrɛ ɲininka ko mun b'o yɔrɔla"" translates to ""people are constantly seeking something,"" and the overall tone points to a continuous striving for more.
* **Option A (Adamadenw tara tamana na dolo wɛrɛw la - People are looking for valuable things)** is close but doesn't fully capture the *constant* and *relentless* nature of the pursuit described in the passage. Option B is a more direct and accurate reflection of the passage's core idea.
* **Option C (Diɲɛnatigɛ be dugukolo wɛrɛw kan - The most valuable things are ambition)** is too specific. While ambition is *a* valuable thing, the passage doesn't limit it to just ambition.
* **Option D (Dolow ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ janya ka dɔgɔn ni kilomɛtiri tiriliyɔn ye - Wealth and the universe are vast, like trillions of kilometers)** is irrelevant to the main point of the passage, which is about the human desire for valuable things.

Therefore, **B** is the most appropriate answer because it directly reflects the passage's theme of people continuously seeking valuable things."
Mun de bɛ dɔgɔya ka t’a fɛ n’i be k’a janya tile camancɛ la?,"The correct answer is **C: Gazi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gazi bɛ dɔkɔya ka taa a fɛ n'i bɛ ka i ma janɲa tile camancɛ la."" This translates to ""Gazi (gas) are released so that they can make the surface shine.""

Therefore, ""Gazi"" (gas) is what makes the surface shine.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, tile fan jumɛn de be ye k’i to Dugukolo kan?","The correct answer is **A: Farajalan**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Which of these is the thing that is connected to Dugukolo?"" The text says ""Farajalan tɛ tile la a bɛ jɔ min kan"" which translates to ""Farajalan is connected to this thing that [is] my friend.""  Therefore, Farajalan is the one connected to Dugukolo.
"
Nin jateminɛli jumɛnw de ye dɛmɛlikɛ ka Copernicus ka hakilina sinsin?,"The correct answer is **A: Venus kɛrɛw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kɛrɛw bɛ Venus la, i n'a fɔ kalo."" This translates to ""Galileo, using the telescope, saw mountains on Venus.""

The question asks what Copernicus's theory predicted that Galileo's observations supported. Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model (sun-centered) where planets orbit the sun.  A key prediction of this model was that planets would sometimes appear to move backwards in the sky (retrograde motion) because of the relative positions and speeds of the Earth and other planets.

Galileo's observation of mountains on Venus directly contradicted the Ptolemaic model (earth-centered) where Venus would always appear as a crescent (similar to the moon) and never show phases like a full moon. This observation, in turn, supported Copernicus's heliocentric model, which predicted Venus would have phases like the moon, just like Earth's moon.

Therefore, Galileo's observation of mountains on Venus was crucial in supporting Copernicus's heliocentric theory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Venus tɛmɛsira (Venus phases):** While Galileo's observation *revealed* Venus phases, the question asks what Copernicus *predicted*.
* **C: Tile ni Venus ye kelen ye minnu na (The Earth and Venus are connected):** This is not a concept associated with Copernicus's theory.
* **D: Tile ni Kalo ye kelen ye minnu na (The Earth and the Sun are connected):** While the Earth and Sun are connected in a heliocentric system, the key prediction Copernicus's model supported was the motion of the planets *around the Sun*, not necessarily a direct connection between the Earth and the Sun in terms of being ""connected"" in a specific way.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de jateminɛna Galileo Galilei fɛ san 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Venus kɛrɛw**.

Here's why:

The question asks what Galileo Galilei observed in 1610. The passage states: ""...Galileo Galilei ye jateminɛ kɛ telescope la ka ye ko kɛrɛw bɛ Venus la..."" which translates to ""...Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe Venus...""  The passage then goes on to describe what he saw about Venus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kalo kɛrɛ min bɛ ɲɛsin tile ma** (The moons that revolve around the Earth): While Galileo *did* discover moons, the passage doesn't mention this specifically in relation to 1610.
*   **C: Dugukolo minnu bɛ munumunu Tile dafɛ** (The planets that revolve around the Sun): While Copernicus's theory was about planets revolving around the Sun, the passage focuses on what Galileo observed about Venus *using his telescope*.
*   **D: Venus tɛmɛsira** (Venus's phases): Galileo *did* observe Venus's phases, but the question asks what he observed *in 1610*. The passage focuses on the fact that he saw phases, but doesn't detail this observation as the main event of 1610.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Amazon Ba bɛ ji sɔrɔ min?","The correct answer is **A: Ba fitininw** (By the sea).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amazoni ba yɛrɛyɛrɛ ye kilomɛtiri 6387 (3980 miles). A be sɔrɔ kabɔ ba bayirikaw fitiniw la."" This translates to: ""The Amazon is a large river, 6387 kilometers (3980 miles) long. It flows through the sea.""

Therefore, the Amazon flows by the sea.  The question asks what the Amazon flows *by*.
"
Nin tanunin jumɛn tɛ talikɛ Amazon Ba la?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba jamujan ba filanna do** (It takes about 8 minutes to cross the river).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""A be ji ta siyɛn 8 min ka ca nin ba belebele filana ji ye."" which translates to ""It takes about 8 minutes to cross the river.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba bɛ la belebele do** (It is about the rapids) - The passage doesn't mention the rapids specifically.
* **C: Ba bɛ la jamujan do** (It is about the jungle) - While the Amazon is in a jungle, the question asks about the time to cross the river.
* **D: ba bɛ la wagalen do** (It is about the wildlife) - The passage doesn't focus on the wildlife."
Baarada jumɛn de kofɔlen do tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ ni Venezuwelaka hakɛ bɛla fitinin de bɛ baara kɛ yen?,"The correct answer is **D: Forobacakɛda**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...fila b'a kɛ forobacakɛda la..."" which translates to ""...they are fleeing as refugees...""

The question asks what people from Venezuela are fleeing *to*. The text says they are fleeing *to* refugee camps. Therefore, ""forobacakɛda"" (refugee camps) is the correct answer.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu cakɛda jumɛn bɛ Venezuwelaka hakɛ bɛ la caman ta?","The correct answer is **C: Bayɛlɛmacakɛda**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Venezuwelakaw fɛ bayɛlɛmacakɛda nafama dɔ ye taji ye..."" This translates to ""Venezuelans are mostly suffering from hunger and poverty...""

Therefore, ""bayɛlɛmacakɛda"" (suffering/hardship) is the closest synonym to the description of the difficult situation faced by Venezuelans.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Forobacakɛda** (in addition): This doesn't fit the context.
* **B: Forobaara** (to be hungry): While hunger is a problem, it doesn't encompass the entire economic hardship described.
* **D: Taji** (poverty/lack of resources):  While related, it's a more specific term than the broader suffering implied in the text.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dolo ka ɲagami b’a yamaruya ka mun kɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Idorozɛne kisɛw dilan**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks: ""What is the thing that is kept in the place where one keeps or protects precious things?""
* **The passage (P)** describes a place that is used to keep valuable items, specifically mentioning ""idorozɛne kisɛw"" which translates to ""precious things"" or ""valuable objects"".  The passage states this place is used to keep ""walema ka ɲagami"" (treasure or wealth) and ""idorozɛne kisɛw"" (precious things).
* **Option D** directly refers to ""Idorozɛne kisɛw dilan"" which translates to ""the place for precious things.""  This aligns perfectly with the description in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka fɛn girinmaw dilan** (The place for green things) - Not mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Ka yeelendimansindorokolen dilan** (The place for things that are used in work) - Not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Ka yeelen ni funteni bila** (The place for things that are eaten) - Not mentioned in the passage.



"
Yeelendimansindorokolen ɲuman ninnu jumɛn bɛ mun dilan?,"The correct answer is **A: Idorozɛni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dolow be yeelen ni funteni di k'a sabu kɛ fanga bɔ ta ye ni idorozƐne kisɛw bɔra (walema ka ɲagami) ɲɔkɔn fɛ ka kɛ dengirimanw ye."" This translates roughly to: ""The pain is a result of the combination of the feeling of a burning sensation and the discomfort of a painful area (or a wound) that is causing the muscles to contract.""

The question asks what the muscles are contracting *because of*. The text directly states that the muscles are contracting because of **idorozɛni** (pain/discomfort).

Therefore, the answer is **Idorozɛni**.
"
Ji dilannen do ni simi fɛn jumɛnw ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Idorozɛni kisɛ fila ani ɔkisiziyɛni kisɛ kelen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A b'a molekili cogola kelen ne ta ali na sɔrɔ a kɛra fiyɛn, ji walima jalen ye. Alina sɔrɔ a farikolo cogoya be seka falen, a dilan cogoya simila be t'a nɔna."" This translates to ""A molecule of carbon is able to form bonds that are strong and stable. Alina's factory makes carbon fibers, and its similar carbon products are not broken easily.""

The text also explains that carbon atoms are bonded with hydrogen and oxygen atoms to form molecules. The breakdown of carbon compounds releases hydrogen and oxygen. Therefore, carbon atoms form bonds with **hydrogen (kisɛ fila)** and **oxygen (kisɛ kelen)**.



"
"Ni ji y’a cogo falen, mun bɛ to a nɔ na?","The correct answer is **A: Molekiliw cogoya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Alina sɔrɔ a farikolo cogoya be seka falen, a dilan cogoya simila be t'a nɔna."" This translates to ""Alina's factory produces a smell, and the smell of the factory is similar to the smell of carbon monoxide.""  

The question asks ""What is the smell of carbon monoxide?"". The text directly answers that the smell *is* the carbon monoxide molecule. While the factory *produces* the smell, the smell itself is the molecule.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn tun tɛ gɛlɛya ye jamanabolo tannisaba kan kuma min a tun b’a fɛ ka sariya dɔw jagoya sigi?","The correct answer is **C: Yɛlɛmali minnu bɛ jamanabolow bɛɛ ka yamaruya jagoya**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a time of hardship and famine where people were desperate. The answer asks what happened during that time to help people survive. The passage states: ""Sariyasen nunuw tun kakan ka yamaruya sɔrɔ jamanabolow bɛɛ fɛ yani uka yɛlɛma wa jamanabolow tun ma cɛmancɛ marabolo in jate kaɲɛ fo ka kɛ uka wasadenw tun te ye yen tuma dɔw la."" This translates to ""The people of the wise ones sought help from the knowledge of the past in order to overcome the extreme hardship and famine that was present, and they did so by taking the path of their ancestors.""

This directly indicates that people looked to the wisdom and practices of their ancestors (the knowledge of the past) for solutions and survival strategies during the famine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kɔlɔsili gɛlɛn ka bɔ fanga ɲɛmɔgɔw yɔrɔ** (The leaders gave instructions to the people): While leaders likely played a role, the passage focuses on the *source* of help, not just the distribution.
*   **B: Fanga tanya Wasabulon kɔnɔnana** (Prayers to the Lord): The passage doesn't mention prayer or religious rituals as the primary means of survival.
*   **D: Ɲɛmɔgɔ fanga tanya** (The people asked for prayers): This is also not supported by the text.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the passage's main point: people sought help and survival strategies by looking to the wisdom and practices of their ancestors.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn de bɛ cɛmacɛ marabolo ka jamanabolow jira ka ɲɛ yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya Kɛlɛ waati la?","The correct answer is **A: Ninsɔngɔnw tun jagoyara Wasabulon ni fanga ɲɛmɔgɔw fɛ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fanga foyi tun te Wasabulon bolo ka nisɔngɔ sigi senkan...minnuw tun te son tuma dɔw la k'aka sariya labaara."" This means the people of Wasabulon were responsible for the security (fanga) that protected the community.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sariyasenw Falenni jigi tun bɛ Wasabulon ɲɛmɔgɔw de kan:** The passage doesn't mention Sariyasenw Falenni.
* **C: Jamanabolo lasigiden tun tɛ yen:** While the passage discusses historical periods, it doesn't say the historical leaders *were* the security.
* **D: Cɛmacɛ marabolo tun ye fɛn koloman fila ye:** The passage doesn't describe the historical figures as physical pillars or structures.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the passage is that the people of Wasabulon were responsible for the security.
"
Daɲɛw sɛbɛnnen do cogodi Yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya Ɲɛfɔli Gafe in kɔkan?,"The correct answer is **A: Sɛbɛnni kumaba la**.

The passage states: ""Yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya Gafe in kɔkanna Sebɛnniw tun ye ''Yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya Ɲɛfɔli Gafe Yɛrɛyɛrɛ min dansigira Zuyekalo tile 4 nan san 1776''.""  This translates to ""The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776.""  Therefore, the Declaration of Independence is what the passage refers to as the ""Sebɛnni"" (the document).
"
Sɛngapuri lakodɔnnen do ni ninnu jumɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Dugubakɔnɔ jirifalen** (DuguYirifalenyɔrɔsumamanba).

The text states: ""San 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, feerewoloso dɔ min tara ka kɛ jamana feere ye. **Sɛngapuri Yirifalenyɔrɔkodɔnnaw ye dɛmɛ kɛ ka gun yɛlɛma ka kɛ duguYirifalenyɔrɔsumamanba ye.**""

This translates to: ""In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a flower that I like, became the national flower. **The national flower of Singapore is the orchid.**""
"
Vanda Miss Joaquim ye mun ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Feere dɔ** (Flower).

The text states: ""San 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, **feerewoloso dɔ min tara ka kɛ jamana feere ye.**"" which translates to ""In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, **a flower was chosen as the national flower.**""

Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a flower.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Giza piramidiw kalite jumɛn tun tɛ kɛ ka kon ka Ezipitikaw Masamara Kura dabaliban?","The correct answer is **C: U kundama (U are amazing/wonderful)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Giza pyramids are delicate and have been weathered over time, but still remain magnificent and full of wonder. Option C, ""U kundama,"" best captures this sentiment of awe and amazement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U si (They are)** - This is a simple statement of existence and doesn't convey the wonder described in the text.
* **B: Gabakuruw labaarali (They are strong/powerful)** - While the pyramids are certainly strong, the text focuses more on their delicate beauty and enduring wonder than their raw strength.
* **D: U dilanni (They are old/ancient)** - The text mentions their age, but the emphasis is on their continued magnificence despite their age.

Therefore, ""U kundama"" is the most fitting answer to the question about the overall impression the Giza pyramids leave."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, bindunbaganw be bɔ yɔrɔ jumɛn ka yaala sanji nɔfɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Tilebin lɛw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O kɔ u bɛ baani na tilebin fɛ..."" which translates to ""It went to the television..."" This directly answers the question of where the people were watching the program.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, bindunbaganw be to ka segin ka bɔ yɔrɔ kelen jumɛn Avirili waati?","The correct answer is **A: Serentigi mara**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Serengeti forobakungobagawmarayɔrɔ...kɔnɔ ani Maasai ForobaKɛnɛkɛrɛnkɛrɛnni Kɛniya kɔnɔ bɛ Serengeti mara kɔnɔ."" This translates to ""Serengeti... and Maasai... in Kenya are in Serengeti.""  The question asks where the elephants are found. The passage directly links the elephants to the Serengeti.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Worodugu lɛw** - This means ""the river"" and is not the place where the elephants are found.
*   **C: Ba Mara** - This refers to the Maasai people, not a location.
*   **D: Maasai Foroba Kɛnɛ Kɛrɛnkɛrɛnni** - This is the name of the Maasai people, not a location where the elephants are found.



"
Kɔkɔjiwara Kɛlɛwale tun ye jamana jumɛn minɛli ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Alimaɲi**.

The text states: ""Alimaɲi ye kɛlɛ in tɔgɔ dogolen da ko ''Kɔkɔjiwara kɛlɛwale''"" which translates to ""Germany was the creator of the code called 'Enigma'.""
"
Alimaɲi bɛ Biritaɲi minɛli weele jogodi?,"The correct answer is **A: Dunkirk**.

The text states: ""Biritaɲi kɛlɛbolo maramafɛn girimanw ni balow fanba ciyɛnna uka Dunkirk bɔli senfɛ..."" which translates to ""British forces were retreating from Dunkirk..."".  This directly answers the question of where the Germans forced the British to retreat.
"
Mun de fɔra k’o ye Itali ka laɲini fan kologɛlɛn dɔ ye walasa ka Farafinna jamanaw sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Tilali jikurunw la Ezipiti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O waleya nunuw kɛrɛfɛ, Itali ka kɛlɛkɛ jikɛlɛkɛkurunw tun bisikiyalen te ka foyi wɛrɛ kɛ. Sisan Zapɔn ka ko la. Zapɔn tun ye gun jamana dɔ ye inafɔ Biritaɲi.""  This means Italy's ancient civilizations expanded and controlled territories, and *then* Japan became a major power, *after* Britain had colonies.  The passage also mentions Italy expanded and controlled territories, and then *also* made colonies in Egypt.

Therefore, the question asks about Italy's ancient colonial expansion and its relationship with ancient Egypt. Option A, ""Tilali jikurunw la Ezipiti"" (colonies in Egypt), directly addresses this. The other options are incorrect based on the information given.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsiran in ye, mun tun jatilen do inafɔ Itali ka kɛlɛ laɲini fanba?","The correct answer is **A: Ka Farafinna jamanw minɛ**.

The text states: ""Itali ka laɲini fanba tun ye Farafinna jamanaw ye."" which translates to ""Itali's history is rooted in the ancient Egyptians.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka kɛlɛbolo ni jikankɛlɛbolo sigi:** This refers to the Etruscans, who were important but not the primary root of Italian history.
* **C: Ka tila Ezipiti jikurunw la:** While there were connections to Egypt, the text specifically points to the influence of the *ancient Egyptians*.
* **D: Ka Biritaɲi kɛlɛdagayɔrɔw sigi:**  The text mentions connections to Britain, but this is not the primary root of Italian history.

Therefore, the best answer based on the provided text is **A**."
Jɔni tun ye teriya kɛ ni binkanikɛlaw ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Faransi Vichy**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Olu tun ye Faransi ''Vichy'' fɛ."" This directly translates to ""It was called Vichy France.""  The passage then goes on to describe Vichy France as the French government that collaborated with Nazi Germany.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alimanw (Germans):** While the Germans collaborated with Vichy France, the passage is asking *who* was the Vichy government itself.
* **C: Amerikikaw (Americans):** The Americans eventually fought against Vichy France.
* **D: Faransi Labilalenw (Free French):** The Free French were the resistance movement *against* Vichy France.



"
Farankan kulu jumɛnw tun sen dona Daragɔn Kɛlɛwalen la?,"The correct answer is **A: Ameriki kaw ni Faransi labilalenw**.

The text states: ""Dogokun fila dɔrɔn Ameriki kaw ni Faransi labilalenw ka kɛlɛbolow ye Faransi baba bolo labila ani firikan in tɔgɔ dara ko ''Daragɔn kɛ lɛ wale''.""  This translates to ""During the war, the alliance between America and France helped the French to regain their territory and the Africans became known as 'Dragons of the West'.""
"
Subahanamansi jumɛn yiriwali kɛra sababu ye jijukɔrɔkurun diyagoyara ka boli ji jukɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: U-Boats**.

The text states: ""Alimaɲi jijukɔrɔkurun tun be wele ko U-Boats."" which translates to ""The Alimanyi (leaders) of the Jukorokurun used U-Boats.""  The question asks what was used by the Jukorokurun to attack the Jukorokurun.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Muguci kuntala (War machines):** While the text mentions war machines, it doesn't specify them as the *primary* means of attacking.
*   **C: Jijukɔrɔkurunboli (Jukorokurun bullets):** The text mentions bullets, but not as the main weapon.
*   **D: Jateminɛ-mansi (Council of chiefs):** The council of chiefs is mentioned as a group that decided on the attack, not as a weapon.

Therefore, **U-Boats** is the only option directly supported by the text as being used by the Jukorokurun in their attacks."
"U labaarakofɔlɔ kɔnɔ, jujukɔrɔkurun ka mun hakɛ tun ka dɔgɔn kosɛbɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Jijukɔrɔkurunboli**.

The passage states: ""Alimaɲi jijukɔrɔkurun tun be wele ko U-Boats. Alimaɲi kaw tun be se kɔsɛbɛ jijukɔrɔkurun bolili n'a lataama cogo la.""

This translates to: ""The Chief of the Iron Coast used U-Boats. The Chief also used iron-coast warships with large guns.""

Therefore, the iron coast warriors used warships (jijukɔrɔkurunboli).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔni tun ma bɛnka labato? ","The correct answer is **D: Soviet kaw**.

Here's why:

The text states that in 1939, Poland was partitioned. It then details that Poland was occupied by the Soviet Union's Red Army and the Belarusian and Ukrainian populations were annexed.  The text explicitly mentions treaties signed with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union was the entity responsible for the partition and occupation.
"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen tun ma kɛ Red Army fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukraine kɛlɛyɔrɔ dilanni**.

The passage states: ""o fɛɛrɛ ninunw kun kɔrɔla suki ni dugujɛ cɛ, tumamina nin kɛlɛkɛdenw min ka ca nin ban 800.000 ka bɔ SoViet's Union Red Army dɔna ani ka Bielorussie dilan, ani **Ukraine kɛlɛkɛyɔrɔ bolo u kɛnikɔ ka Pɔlɔɲi kɔrɔn maarayɔrɔ minɛ nin Riga Peace Treaty...**""

This directly indicates that the Red Army invaded Ukraine.  The other options are incorrect.
"
Mun de tun ye Itali Tenth Army Mansimanfɛbaara-Ɲɛmɔgɔ sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: A tun minɛla Fort Capuzzo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuhĩtũkira ihithũkĩra Irathĩro rĩa Bardia, Ngeretha niyanyitire mĩgwate General Lastucci ũrĩa warĩ Inginia mũnene wa mbatũ ya Itari rĩa Ikũmi.. Kũrĩ mweri wa gatandatũ 10, 1940, mbatu ya Ngeretha ya Hussars 11 niyegwatiire Fort Capuzzo kuu Libya.""

This translates to: ""Following the raid on the Bardia Road, the British forces attacked the troops of General Lastucci who was the commander of the Italian Tenth Army... On March 10, 1940, the British Hussars regiment 11 occupied Fort Capuzzo in Libya.""

Therefore, the Tenth Italian Army's main position was Fort Capuzzo.
"
Itabo Balbo tun fakara yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Kũrĩ mweri wa gatandatũ 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, ũrĩa warĩ Gavana Mũnene wa Libya na mũgai wa Mussolini nĩoragirwo nĩ mbũtũ ciao o hĩndĩ akinya **Tobruk**."" which translates to ""On March 28th, Marshal Italo Balbo, who was the Governor-General of Libya and Mussolini's representative, was ordered to attack **Tobruk**.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu fɛɛrɛw jumɛn kelen ye Tibetan tasili fan nafama do ye?","The correct answer is **A: Fiyɛnminɛ degeli baaraw (Subtle body)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nin Kundalini Yoya ye, kundalini fagan (yelen fagan) be kunun ni yoga sigicogow, fiyɛnminɛ degeli baaraw, kuma kanw ani lajɛli yɔrɔnikelenw ye."" This translates to: ""And in Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (golden energy) is a source of yoga practice, the subtle body, the mind, and the nervous system.""

The question asks what *the subtle body* is (in the context of the passage). The passage directly identifies the subtle body (""fiyɛnminɛ degeli baaraw"") as one of the aspects connected to Kundalini Yoga, and therefore a key component related to Tibetan tantra.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kumakanw yɔrɔnikelen (Nervous system):** While the nervous system is *part* of the subtle body, the text specifically mentions the subtle body as the overarching concept.
*   **C: Maaw canman lajɛli (Mental abilities):** Mental abilities are *also* part of the subtle body, but not the encompassing definition.
*   **D: Yoga sigicogow ɲɛdɔnni (Yoga practices):** Yoga practices are *used* to work with the subtle body, but the subtle body itself is the *thing* being discussed.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fanga tɛmɛsira be dayɛlɛ cokodi Tibetan tasili “camancɛ” kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **D: Fiyɛnminɛ degeli baaraw (Subtle energies)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nin Kundalini Yoya ye, kundalini fagan (yelen fagan) be kunun ni yoga sigicogow, **fiyɛnminɛ degeli baaraw**, kuma kanw ani lajɛli yɔrɔnikelenw ye.""

This translates to: ""In Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (golden energy) is a coiled yoga energy, **subtle energies**, and the body's vital life force and psychic powers.""

The question asks what ""tɛmɛsira"" (subtle energies) are, and the text directly identifies them as ""fiyɛnminɛ degeli baaraw"".



"
Jɔni tun ye bato fɔli filanan kɛ bakuruba in kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanju Sharma**.

The text states: ""Dɔnkilidala Sanju Sharma ye sufɔli daminɛ..."" which translates to ""Donkilidala Sanju Sharma ye sufɔli daminɛ...""  This means Sanju Sharma was the main donor.
"
"Ka kɛnɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔni tun ye bato fɔli dɔ kɛ dumuni di waati kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's the reasoning:

The question asks who sang the most bhajans (devotional songs). The text states:

*   ""O kɔfɛ Lakkha Singh ye bahjans fɔli kun ta."" (Lakkha Singh sang all the bhajans).
*   ""Lakkha ye chappan bhajan fana yira."" (Lakkha sang fifty-six bhajans).

The other options are mentioned in the text, but they are not identified as having sung the most bhajans. Therefore, Lakkha Singh is the correct answer.
"
Su fɔli -laban filanan tun ye jumɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina ani Haris Alexiou**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Turquie donkilidaraŋana Sezen Aksu donna kɛnɛ kɔnɔ ni Italieka Alessandro Safina ni Girɛsi donkilidala Haris Alexiou ye."" (Turkish singers Sezen Aksu are also present along with Italian Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fire of Anatolia:** This is mentioned as a performance, not a singer.
*   **C: Whirling Dervishes:** This is a performance, not a singer.
*   **D: Fatih Erkoç ani Müslüm Gürses:** These are mentioned as performers, but the question asks for singers in total, and Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou are listed as singers.



"
Alessandro Safinna ye jamana jumɛn den ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Italieka**.

The text states: ""Istanbul Foroba Fɔlikulu, Janissary Fɔlikulu dɔ ni dɔnkilidalaw Fatih Erkoç ani Müslüm Gürses. O kɔ Whirling Dervishes donna kɛnɛ kɔnɔ. Turquie dɔnkilidaraŋana Sezen Aksu donna kɛnɛ kɔnɔ ni **Italieka Alessandro Safina** ni Girɛsi donkilidala Haris Alexiou ye.""

This directly tells us that Alessandro Safina is from Italy.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasen jumɛn te tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **A: Tasuma tun wuli la Santa Clara**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Where did they find the people?""
* **The passage states:** ""Tasuma Kɛlɛbolo ɲɛmɔgɔ Scott Kouns tun ko, ''Ni tun ye tile fariman don ye Santa Clara ni kalaya hakɛ 90w ye.'' "" This translates to ""According to the Keralan spokesman Scott Kouns, 'We were searching in Santa Clara and nearby areas.'""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mɔgɔw tun balannen do sanfɛ-tulokɛ mɔbilini la:**  This translates to ""People were searching for these off-road vehicles.""  While related, it doesn't directly answer *where* they were found.
* **C: Ji tun dira taamadenw ma:** This translates to ""The people who were talking about the incident."" This is irrelevant to the location.
* **D: A dɔgɔyalen, mɔgɔw be miniti 60 kɛ sani mɔgɔ fɔlɔ ka lajigin:** This translates to ""Furthermore, people in 60 minutes were searching for the people."" This talks about the timeframe, not the location.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn tun ye hakilina di ka ɲɛsin mɔgɔw ka lafiya baliya la funteni hakɛ fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Mɔbilini bolibaga (Mobile phone operator)**.

Here's why:

* The text states Scott Kouns, a representative of ""Tasuma Kɛlɛbolo ɲɛmɔgɔ"" (a type of mobile network), says that mobile phones are a crucial tool for people to report accidents and get help. 
* He emphasizes that it's important for people to be able to report accidents quickly and safely using their mobile phones.

Therefore, the mobile phone operator is the entity facilitating this reporting and ensuring safety.
"
Kuran tun tigɛra min ka sabu kɛ tsunami wale ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""Tiɲɛnniba ni banaliba si ma lakalen Tonga, nka kuran tun tigɛra waati kunkuruni kɔnɔ min ye a to Tonga famaw tun te se ka tsunami lasɔmili sɔrɔ ka bɔ PTWC yɔrɔ la."" This translates to ""The earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Tonga caused the water to rise, which was then reported by the PTWC.""

While the tsunami affected Pago Pago and Niue, and Hawaii monitored the situation, the *cause* of the tsunami was the earthquake in Tonga.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kuran tigɛ in tun ye mun de se Tonga ma?","The correct answer is **A: Tiɲɛnniba tun lakalen la** (The situation was reportedly calm).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Tiɲɛnniba ni banaliba si ma lakalen Tonga...nka kuran tun tigɛra waati kunkuruni kɔnɔ min ye a to Tonga famaw tun te se ka tsunami lasɔmili sɔrɔ ka bɔ PTWC yɔrɔ la.""  This translates to: ""Reports from Tonga said that the water was rising...and the authorities in Tonga said that a tsunami warning was issued by PTWC.""  This implies that the situation *was* reported as calm *before* the tsunami warning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Famaw tun ma kunnafoni sɔrɔ ka ɲɛsin lasɔmili wulilen ko ma** (The authorities in Tonga issued a tsunami warning). While the authorities *did* issue a warning, the question asks about the situation *before* the warning was issued.
* **C: Kɔkɔji hakɛ tun yɛlɛma na** (The earthquake was strong). The passage doesn't explicitly state the earthquake's strength, only that it happened.
* **D: Famaw tun ma se ka lasɔmili jɔnjɔnw sɔrɔ** (The authorities in Tonga said the tsunami was small). The passage doesn't mention the size of the potential tsunami, only that a warning was issued.



"
Waati jumɛnna lakanatigilamɔgɔw tun sera ka teliyasumanikɛlaw kɛ ka Jonny Reid ka boli teliya suma?,"The correct answer is **C: Tuma min’a tun bɛ ka boli ka tɛmɛ km 160 nɛgɛ kanɲɛ kelen kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Mr Reid sera ka New Zealand A1GP mɔbili, Black beauty boli k'a tɛmɛ km 160 kan nɛgɛ kanɲɛ kelen kɔnɔ babili in sanfɛ siyɛn wolowila New Zealand lakanatigilamɔgɔw ye gɛlɛya sɔrɔ walasa ka Mr Reid ka boli teliya suma ni teliyasumanikɛlaw ye bawu Black Beauty ka surun, tuma kelen min na u sera ka Mr Reid ka boli teliya suma o kɛra waati minna a bolila km 160 kan nɛgɛ kanɲɛ kelen kɔnɔ""

This translates to: ""...Mr Reid drove the New Zealand A1GP car, Black beauty, for 160 kilometers in the first lap, and he drove it with great skill, surpassing the best New Zealand drivers and gaining the admiration of the New Zealand public, and it was evident that Mr. Reid drove the car for 160 kilometers in the first lap.""

Option C directly reflects this information. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tuma min’a tun bɛ ka boli km 160 nɛgɛ kanɲɛ kelen kɔnɔ** is incomplete.
*   **B: A siyɛn wolowila babili in sanfɛ** is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: A siyɛn fɔlɔ babili in sanfɛ** is not mentioned in the text.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, munna a tun gɛlɛya la New Zealand lakanatigilamɔgɔw fɛ ka Jonny Reid ka boli teliya suma?","The correct answer is **C: A tun ye mɔbili boli ka tɛmɛ babili in sanfɛ siyɛn wolowila**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Jonny Reid drove the New Zealand A1GP car, nicknamed ""Black Beauty,"" for 48 laps at the Auckland Harbour Circuit. 
* The question asks *what* he drove the car *to do*.
* The passage explicitly says he drove the car to ""surun, tuma kelen min na u sera ka Mr Reid ka boli teliya suma o kɛra waati minna a bolila km 160 kan nɛgɛ kanɲɛ kelen kɔnɔ"" which translates to ""to win, achieve the time that Mr. Reid set when he drove 160 kilometers in the heat.""  This means he was competing to achieve the fastest lap time.
* Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they don't reflect the purpose of the drive. He didn't just drive a certain distance, the car didn't just become a timekeeper, and the circuit didn't just provide a location. He drove to compete for the fastest lap time.



"
Yɔrɔ jumɛnna dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ kɛrɛ a ni Butte cɛman cɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Nɔngɔnɲɛ 65 kaɲɛka fɛ**.

The passage states: ""Dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ tun ye kilomɛtɛrɛ 65 (nɔngɔnɲɛ 45) Butte worodugu fɛ."" This translates to ""The earthquake was 65 miles (45 kilometers) from Butte.""
"
Mun tun kɛra Abu Ghraib ka kasobɔn wolikajɔ senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Danmantɛmɛ wale kɛli hakili banabatɔw la**.

Here's why:

* **P (Question):** The question asks *what* the Abu Ghraib prison scandal was about. It describes it as abuse of prisoners by American soldiers.

* **Q (Question):** The question asks *what* happened in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.

* **A (Answer):** ""Danmantɛmɛ wale kɛli hakili banabatɔw la"" translates to ""Prisoners were subjected to abuse by American soldiers.""  This directly answers the question of *what* happened (the abuse).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Datuguli dɔ (This is a word/phrase and doesn't provide information about the scandal.)**
* **C: Ameriki finitigiw tun ye fanga minɛ (American soldiers were involved.)**  While true (as stated in the question), this doesn't *explain* what happened. It just confirms who was involved.
* **D: Tasuma tun bila la kasobɔn na (The scandal was a lie.)** This is incorrect. The Abu Ghraib scandal is well-documented and not a lie.



Therefore, option A provides the most accurate and complete answer to the question ""Mun tun kɛra Abu Ghraib ka kasobɔn wolikajɔ senfɛ?"" (What happened in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal?).
"
Munna Iraqi kasobɔn tun ye tɔgɔbasɔrɔ? ,"The correct answer is **D: Danmantɛmɛ wale kɛli hakili banabatɔw la lakodɔnni.**

Here's why:

* **P asks about the nature of the Abu Ghraib prison abuses.** It describes them as torture committed by American soldiers on Iraqi prisoners.
* **Q asks if Iraqi prisoners were also torturers.**  This is a key question based on the premise of P.
* **A says ""Tasuma tun bilalen do a la""** which is unclear and doesn't directly answer the question.
* **B says ""Ameriki finitigiw tun ye fanga ta""** which is already stated in P. It doesn't address the question about Iraqi prisoners.
* **C says ""Danmantɛmɛ walew tun ka ca""** which means ""Prisoners also do it"". This is too vague and doesn't explain *who* is being tortured *by whom*.
* **D says ""Danmantɛmɛ wale kɛli hakili banabatɔw la lakodɔnni""** which translates to ""Prisoners also endured the brutality of those who were oppressed/wronged."" This implies that Iraqi prisoners were *victims* of torture, not perpetrators. This aligns with the established narrative in P that American soldiers were the torturers.

Therefore, option D is the only one that logically follows from the provided information and answers the question posed in Q.  It highlights that Iraqi prisoners were the ones suffering the torture.



"
Ɲɛnajɛ sugu jumɛn tun bina kɛ Maui Kɛlɛ Hakilijigin Ntolatankɛnɛ kan?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntolatan**.

The passage states: ""FɔlijƐkulu in ka fɔli bɔra ama Maui Kɛlɛ Hakilijigin **NtolatankƐnƐ** kan..."" which translates to ""The school is buying a building for Maui Kɛlɛ Hakilijigin **Institute**..."".

Therefore, the answer is Institute (Ntolatan).
"
Jɔnni tun ye kun jɔnjɔn fɔ ka ɲɛsin ɲɛnajɛ bɔli y’ama ?,"The correct answer is **A: Fɔlijɛkulu in**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Who is the company that is responsible for the construction of the buildings?"" The passage states: ""FɔlijƐkulu in ɲƐmɔgɔyaso ba, HK Management Inc."" which translates to ""The school is a project of HK Management Inc."" Therefore, the school (FɔlijƐkulu) is the company responsible.
"
Jɔnni tun miirila Bishkek sigibagaw caman tun nɔ bɛ sonyali in la?,"The correct answer is **A: Sariyasinsinɲɛmɔgɔw**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""Who are the specialists who help translate from Bishkek to another language?""

The passage states: ""Sariyasinsinɲɛmɔgɔw tun tɛ Bishkek bolɔnkɔnɔna kɛnɛ kan."" which translates to ""Translators are those who translate from Bishkek to another language."" 

Therefore, ""Sariyasinsinɲɛmɔgɔw"" (Translators) is the correct answer. The other options are mentioned in the text as roles or characteristics of people in Bishkek, but not the specific group who do the translation work."
Jɔnni tun jigina mɔgɔmurutiniw la ka bɔ worodugu fɛ sonyali in na?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkek sigibagaw**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Jɔnni tun jigina mɔgɔmurutiniw la ka bɔ worodugu fɛ sonyali in na?"" which translates to ""Who are the habitual residents who live in Sonyali?"".
* **The text states:** ""Bishkek sigibagaw caman tun jigina mɔgɔmurutiniw la ka bɔ worodugu fɛ sariya bonyabaliya la."" which translates to ""Bishkek's habitual residents are the ones who live in the Sonyali region.""

Therefore, the habitual residents in Sonyali are the residents of Bishkek.

Waati jumɛn dɔfarala Ring ka ferew kan?,"The correct answer is **A: A bɔlen kɔfɛ Shark Tank ka**.

The text states: ""Siminoff ye a fɔ ko dɔfarala fere kan a bɔlen a bɔlen kɔfɛ Shark Tank ka epizɔdi dɔ la san 2013 min senfɛ lajɛmukan in ye a ban ka startup kuraw dɔ dɛmɛ."" This translates to: ""Siminoff first promoted it by appearing on the show Shark Tank in an episode in 2013...""

Therefore, option A is the accurate answer.
"
Waati jumɛnna Jamie Siminoff y’a laɲini ka Ring cakɛli daminɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Shark Tank ka bɔlen bannen kɔfɛ**.

The text states: ""Siminoff ye a fɔ ko dɔfarala fere kan a bɔlen a bɔlen kɔfɛ Shark Tank ka epizɔdi dɔ la san 2013 min senfɛ lajɛmukan in ye a ban ka startup kuraw dɔ dɛmɛ."" (Siminoff pitched the company and appeared on Shark Tank in 2013...)

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A bɔlen a kalama k’a ka da konko nɛkɛ tun maɲi** - While he sought funding, the text specifically mentions the *Shark Tank* appearance.
*   **C: Dɛmɛ sɔrɔlen kɔfɛ** - The text doesn't mention dealing with investors in general.
*   **D: A bɔlen kɔfɛ QVC fɛ ka ɲɛ** - The text mentions his appearance on QVC *later* (in 2017) after gaining more traction. The initial question is about how he *started* to gain prominence.

Rainbow Kalani kelen o kelen tun bi layini jumɛn se denmisɛnw ma?,"The question asks: ""Rainbow Kalani kelen o kelen tun bi layini jumɛn se denmisɛnw ma?"" This is in a language that isn't readily identifiable. However, considering the context of the provided text (which is in English about the show Reading Rainbow), it's likely this question is *about* Reading Rainbow.  It seems to be asking something like ""What are the key points or lines of the program?""

Let's analyze the provided options:

*   **A: Jabarani jabɔliw** -  This doesn't seem to be a meaningful response in relation to the text or the question.
*   **B: Sigida gafemarayɔrɔw** - This also appears to be nonsensical in the context.
*   **C: Dakunw** - Again, unlikely to be relevant.
*   **D: Gafew** - This is also not a valid response.

**The question itself is poorly phrased and seems to be in a foreign language.** Without a translation of the question, and given that none of the options make sense in relation to Reading Rainbow, it's impossible to definitively choose the correct answer. It's possible the question is a trick or contains a typo.

**However, if we have to *guess* based on what the question *might* be asking, and focusing on the positive impact described in the text, a possible interpretation is that the question is asking about the show's message/core idea.**

The text emphasizes:

*   The show's focus on the joy of reading.
*   The show's ability to inspire children to pick up books and read.
*   The impact of the show in cultivating a love of reading.

**Therefore, *if* the question is about the show's central message, a possible (and extremely speculative) answer might be something related to the joy of reading.**  However, without understanding the language of the question, this is purely conjecture.

**Given the choices and the lack of understanding of the language of the question, it is impossible to give a definite answer.**  There is likely an error in the question itself.  I cannot confidently choose any of the provided options.



**Therefore, I cannot select an answer.**
"
Mun de be se ka nɔnba bɔ Rainbow Kalani seriw bɔli a ma?,"The correct answer is **C: John Grant ka hakilina**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Hamwe na John Grant, amwe metĩkĩtie atĩ ũnyihu wa mĩcara na ũgarũrũku wa mwĩcirĩrie wa gĩthomo kĩa tafaarĩra nĩgĩcangĩire gũthira kwa kĩbindi kĩu."" (Along with John Grant, some experts believed that the popularity and creative approach to reading contributed to the success of this show.)

This means John Grant is mentioned as someone who supported and spoke about the show's success. The question asks who *hakilina* (believed/supported) the Rainbow show.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wari ko dɛsɛ (It is a dream):** This is not directly supported by the passage.
* **B: Emmy jɔnɲɔn sɔrɔbaliya (A truly important Emmy):** While the show won Emmys, the passage doesn't focus on the Emmys themselves.
* **D: Mister Rogers sigida yiriwali (Mister Rogers is not important):** The passage mentions Mister Rogers as a character on the show but doesn't offer an opinion on his importance.



"
Ninnu jumɛn tun ma fɔ duguɲɛmɔgɔw fɛ Amsterdam ni sekonidɔnkomaraso fɛ ka ɲɛsin yiri in ma?,"The correct answer is **C: Biyɛlɛnbaana y’a minɛ**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** Who visited the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam?
* **The text states:**  ""Duguɲɛmɔgɔw minnu bɛ Amsterdam ni sekonidɔnkomaraso Anne Frank kama ko biyɛlɛnbaana bɛ yiriw minɛ min bɛ se ka mɔgɔw ka kɛnɛya bila ngalama na u ka dalu kɛra k'a bɛ yɛlɛman farati kɔnɔ."" This translates to: ""Many people visit the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, where children visit to see the place where a man hid to escape the persecution of the Nazis.""  This directly indicates children are among those who visit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A tun te se ka bali bini ma cogosila (It is said that it is not a difficult thing):** This is irrelevant to who visits the house.
* **B: A tun kan ka lakana (It is said that it is interesting):**  While the house is certainly interesting, the question asks *who* visits.
* **D: A bɛ mɔgɔw ka kɛnɛya bila ngalama na (It is people who hid to escape persecution):** This describes *who hid* in the house, not who *visits* it now.

This translates to: ""New South Wales RSPCA inspector David O'Shannessy told ABC that the large number of dogs seized by the RSPCA in Australia were **caught on CCTV**.""

Therefore, CCTV cameras are the method used by the RSPCA to capture the dogs.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tun be se ka dɛmɛn do ka bagaw nafa sinsin Ɔstarali baganfakayɔrɔ barakɛlaw fɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Yamaruya ɲɔgɔn ye RSPCA fɛ (Police and RSPCA investigation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the RSPCA is investigating the puppy farm and that police are involved. It also mentions CCTV footage is being reviewed.  The core of the action being taken to address the problem is the investigation by both the police and the RSPCA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: CCTV ja maralanw sigili (CCTV footage)** While CCTV footage is *being reviewed*, it's not the investigation itself. It's evidence *used in* the investigation.
* **C: Tuma bɛ baganfakayɔrɔ fɛsɛfɛsɛliw (Sending the puppy farmers to prison)**  The passage *doesn't* state the puppy farmers have been sent to prison. The investigation is ongoing.
* **D: ABC ka kɔlɔsili (ABC reporting)** ABC reporting is simply *reporting* on the situation, it's not part of the solution or investigation.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ min tun minnɛn na ka baara tun ye mun ye?","The correct answer is **B: Kunnafoni diladɔ ni Minneapolis Star-Tribune** (News reports from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune).

Here's why:

* The question asks where the report about Louis Jourdain being a victim of the shooting came from.
* The provided text explicitly states: ""No riboti kuuma kwĩ mundũ ũĩ thitango ĩno nicikinyĩire Minneapolis Star-Tribune cikiuga atĩ..."" which translates to ""The report about this person was obtained from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kalanden** (A certain/somehow): This is a general word and doesn't specify the source of the report.
* **C: Kabila ɲɛmɔgɔ** (Tribal council): While Louis Jourdain is connected to the Red Lake Tribal chairman, the report itself originated from a news source, not the tribal council.
* **D: Red Lake marako** (Red Lake community): Similar to the tribal council, the report came from a news source covering the event, not directly from the Red Lake community.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, tuma min kunnafoni tun be ka jɛnsɛn minɛni wɛrɛw ka, sabagatɔ joli tun janajaw be ka kɛ?","The answer is **B: Saba (Seven)**.

The question is asking ""How many days are there in a week?"". In Swahili, ""saba"" means seven.
"
"Ni mɔgɔmurutiniw jabi ye, jamana jumɛn tun ma taɲɛn na ACTA bɛnka bolonɔbila ye?","The correct answer is **B: Polɔɲi (Poland)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mĩrũrũngano mĩnene mweri mũhetũku kũria Poland rĩrĩa bũrũri ũcio wahũrire kĩrore ACTA, ĩrĩa ĩtũmĩte thirikari ya Poland ĩtue dĩkũhetũkia wĩiguithanio ũcio."" This translates to: ""Several cities, including Poland, supported the ACTA agreement, which led the Polish government to repeatedly reject the agreement.""

Therefore, Poland was a key country involved in the debate surrounding ACTA and actively opposed it.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jamana jumɛnw tun y’a laɲini k’u ACTA doni bila kɔfɛ la?","The correct answer is **B: Lithuania**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Vilnius thĩinĩ wa Lithuania..."" and then lists Lithuania as one of the countries that ""nĩ mabĩte kũrũgamia mũtaratara wa kuĩngĩra ACTA"" (strongly opposed the entry into ACTA).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Estonia:** While Estonia is mentioned as a city with a data center, the text only says it's *within* Estonia, not that Estonia opposed ACTA.
*   **C: Scotland:** Scotland is listed with Edinburgh and Glasgow, but there's no mention of Scotland's stance on ACTA.
*   **D: Latvia:** The text specifically mentions Latvia as one of the countries that opposed ACTA.

Therefore, Lithuania is the only option explicitly linked to opposing ACTA in the text.



"
Mɔgɔ joli tun bana na ka sabu kɛ Ipodi kalaya kojugu kasaraw ye?,"The correct answer is **D: 34**.

The question asks how many countries Apple has stopped selling iPods in. The text states: ""METI ko Apple y'a kunnafoni kalayali kojugu kasara **34** wɛrɛ la..."" which translates to ""METI and Apple have stopped selling iPods in **34** countries...""
"
Jɔnni tun y’a fɔ ko kalaya kojugu kasaraw tun ma juguya kosɔbɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: METI**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *who* has banned the import of iPods.
* The passage states: ""Zapɔn jamana Sɔrɔ, Jakɔ ani Dilanni Minisiriso (METI) y'a fɔ k'a lasɔmina kasaraw 27 la minnu dulolendo ni mansinmafɛnw la."" which translates to ""In the current era, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (METI) has banned the import of 27 types of goods...""

Therefore, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (METI) is the entity that imposed the ban.
"
"A ka kumalase senfɛ, Steve Jobs tun ye mun fɔ ko Apple tun bina o lakurakura ya?","The correct answer is **D: Tɛkinolozi (Technology)**.

Here's why:

The question asks *why* Apple grew. The original statement says that Apple grew because of the iPhone. The iPhone's success was due to technological innovation. Therefore, technology is the reason Apple grew.

*   **A: Tariku (History)** - While history is relevant, it doesn't directly explain the growth.
*   **B: Telefɔni in (Telephones)** - The iPhone *is* a phone, but the underlying reason for its growth wasn't just being a phone; it was the innovative technology within it.
*   **C: Barada in (Brothers)** - This is irrelevant to the reason for Apple's growth.



"
Steve Jobs ka lɛrɛ fila kumalase tun kun ye mun ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka telefɔni kura dɔ bɔ**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what Steve Jobs ""lɛrɛ"" (started/launched).
* The text states ""Bi Apple bena Iphone in lakurakura ya..."" which translates to ""When Apple started the iPhone..."".
* Therefore, the answer is that he started the iPhone, which is a phone.



"
Crisrina Fernandez de Krichner tun ye mun fɔ Arizantine Kɔtɔbaso la?,"The correct answer is **B: A ka wasadenya ɲini ɲaniya jiira** (She was a candidate for governor).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mrs Kirchner y'a kan bɔli ɲɛmɔgɔya ɲini ɲaniya jiira Arizantine kɔtɔbaso la,"" which translates to ""Mrs Kirchner was a candidate for governor of the Argentine province.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ka jamanaɲɛmɔgɔya ɲinili** (She was a political figure): While true, this is too general. The question asks for her specific role.
* **C: A ka wulikajɔ Buenos Aires marabolo wasadenya ɲinini na** (She was a mayor of Buenos Aires): The passage mentions her connection to Buenos Aires, specifically the 2005 Buenos Aires mayoral elections, but doesn't say she was a mayor.
* **D: A ka fɛɛrɛ k’a sebɔ wasaden ya jɔrɔla nin waati na** (She was elected to a position she ran for): This is close to the truth but not as precise as ""candidate."" She *was* running for the position.



"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner tun y’a wasadenya ɲaniya ɲinini kɛ yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **C: Argentine kɔtɔbaso la mayili 31 ani Buenos Aires cɛ**.

Here's why:

The question asks where Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was born. The text states: ""Mrs Kirchner y'a kan bɔli ɲɛmɔgɔya ɲini ɲaniya jiira Arizantine kɔtɔbaso la, a y'a ka san 2005 Buenos Aires marabolo wasadenya ɲinini wulikajɔ daminɛ o yɔrɔ kelen in da la.""

This translates to: ""Mrs Kirchner was born in an Argentine province, which is 31 miles (50 kilometers) from Buenos Aires."" Therefore, she was born in an Argentine province located 31 miles from Buenos Aires. Option C accurately reflects this information.
"
ACMA ka jabiw tun ye jumɛn ye ka ɲɛsin Big Brother ma?,"The correct answer is **D: Kɔnɔ tun sɔrɔlen do bɔlɔlɔkanfɛn fɛ minnu tun ka kan ka mara so dɔ kɔnɔ.**

Here's why:

* **The question (P)** asks about the ACMA's role in regulating Big Brother, specifically concerning the broadcasting of content that could harm viewers. It asks how they enforce rules and stop harmful content.
* **Option D** translates to: ""The content is monitored, and if something harmful is found, action is taken against it."" This accurately reflects the ACMA's regulatory function - monitoring content and taking action when violations occur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ɲakinisariyaw tun batolen do (The news is telling this.)** This is too general. While news might report on ACMA actions, it doesn't explain the *how* of the regulation.
* **B: Bɔlɔlɔ kɔnɔ ko y'a ye ko mara tun kɛn bɛ Big Brother ka bɔlɔlɔso kɔnɔ (The broadcasting is what is being done with Big Brother's content.)**  This is a description of broadcasting, not about the ACMA's regulatory *role*.
* **C: Ɲakinisariyaw tun batolen tɛ (The news has told that.)** Similar to A, this is too general and doesn't address the core of the question.

Therefore, option D is the only one that directly answers the question about the ACMA's enforcement of rules related to harmful content in Big Brother."
Dan jumɛn bɛ bɔlɔlɔ kan min bɛ jate ka kɛ bɔlɔlɔkanfɛnw ye?,"The correct answer is **B: A ka kan ka mara so dɔ kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** How can ACMA (the broadcasting authority) punish a Big Brother housemate who has violated the rules? The question implies a penalty or consequence.
* **Option B: A ka kan ka mara so dɔ kɔnɔ** translates to ""ACMA can punish him/her."" This directly answers the question about the possible outcome of a rule violation.
* **Option A: A ka kan ka taa ka segin kɛ bɔlɔlɔ kan** translates to ""ACMA can only follow the rules of the Big Brother show."" This is not a punishment; it's a limitation of ACMA's power.
* **Option C: A te se ka mara bɔlɔlɔso kan** translates to ""ACMA can only give warnings."" This is a weaker form of punishment and not the most comprehensive answer.
* **Option D: ACMA ka kan ka sɔn a ma** translates to ""ACMA can't do anything."" This is incorrect, as ACMA has regulatory power.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate and direct response to the question.



"
Jɔn ye Ɔsitrali Liberal Party ton ɲɛmɔgɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text states: ""Peter Costello Australia waribon tigi ye mɔgɔ min ka teli ka na Minisiri ɲɛmɔgɔ John Howard nɔna ka sabu kɛ Liberal Party ton y'a ka dɛmɛ di nikiliyɛr goni dilanyɔrɔko ma Australia Mr Costello ko tuma minna nikiliyɛri goni labɛnni be se ka kɛ wariko sira fɛ...""

This translates to: ""Peter Costello was the most senior minister under Prime Minister John Howard and a member of the Liberal Party in Australia. Mr. Costello said that the country was on the verge of bankruptcy.""

Therefore, Peter Costello was a minister in the Liberal Party.
"
Munna nikiliyɛri goni dilanyɔrɔko tɛ Ɔsitrali fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Jamana dɛmɛ sɔrɔbaliya**.

The text states: ""Australia ka kan ka se tɛmɛ n'a jenini ye 'N'a kɛra jagoko ye, an ka kan ka sɔrɔ. O kɔrɔ ye, balili jonjon sarati te nikiliyɛri goni la'"" which translates to ""Australia has been a country of strong values. It is a country that always strives forward. It is a country that always seeks the best.""

This implies that a key value or characteristic of Australia is being a nation of strong values and striving for the best. ""Jamana dɛmɛ sɔrɔbaliya"" (a country of strong values) best captures this sentiment.
"
Jikan bolikɛla jumɛn tun ye jɔgɔndan kɛ ni yiralikɛla ka dɛmɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Anna Jochemsen**.

The text states: ""U tun ye Holandi Anna ye Jochemsen min kɛra jɔyɔrɔ kɔnɔtɔnnan ye muso ka jɔnjɔn kɛnɛ in sɔrɔ ."" This translates to ""She is Dutch Anna Jochemsen who is a winner of super-G World Cup and a winner of the Super-G race.""
"
Jamana jumɛn tun tilala ɲɔgɔndan jɔyɔrɔ tan na Super-G muso ka ɲɔgɔndan na?,"The correct answer is **A: Fɛlandi**.

The text states: ""U tun ye Holandi Anna ye Jochemsen min kɛra jɔyɔrɔ kɔnɔtɔnnan ye muso ka ɲɔgɔndan Super-G in na kunu, wa ani **Fɛlandi Katja Saarinen** min kɛra mɔgɔ kɔnɔtɔnnan ye ni ɲɔgɔndan kelen in na."" This translates to ""Anna and Jochemsen from the Netherlands are known for their winning positions in Super-G, but also Katja Saarinen from **Finland** is known for winning positions in the sport.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn te tiɲɛn ye Blake ka?","The correct answer is **B: A tun sen be ataki in na**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks: ""Was Blake found guilty of the crime?""
* **The passage (P)** states: ""Blake noanyitĩtwo na thitango ya kũgeria kũgirĩria wĩigĩrĩku wa igoti."" This translates to ""Blake was convicted on a charge of attempted murder with a firearm.""  A conviction means he *was* found guilty.
* **Option B** translates to: ""He was actually found guilty.""  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A tun minɛna ka to sɛni kan** - ""We think it's not possible.""  This is irrelevant to the facts of the case.
* **C: Bere tun ba boli ataki kɔnɔ** - ""They didn't even try to prove it."" This implies a lack of evidence, which isn't stated in the passage.
* **D: A tun be ka fɔ k’u tun ye bidɔn fili a ma** - ""They were actually looking for the firearm."" This is also irrelevant to the question of Blake's guilt.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛn ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn kelen tun ma kɛ Blake la?","The correct answer is **A: A tun jalakila ka sabu kɛ sariya yɛlɛmali ye**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What did the jury find Blake guilty of?"" (Ka kɛɲɛn ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn kelen tun ma kɛ Blake la?)
* **The text states:** ""Blake noanyitĩtwo na thitango ya kũgeria kũgirĩria wĩigĩrĩku wa igoti."" (Blake was convicted on a charge of manslaughter.)
* **Option A translates to:** ""The jury found him guilty of manslaughter."" (A tun jalakila ka sabu kɛ sariya yɛlɛmali ye)

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: A tun minɛna (They doubted)** - The text states he *was* convicted, not that they doubted.
* **C: A tun ataki la ni bere ye (They didn't find him guilty)** - This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **D: A tun fɔla ye ka tun be sɔnka ta kaso la (They acquitted him because they thought the case was weak)** - This is incorrect; he was convicted.

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the jury's verdict as described in the text."
Diɲɛlaminitɔnba waatiyɛlɛma ka dɛmɛ tina kɛ ka mun kɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Jison ka sobin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Musaga bɛ se ka ɲɛsin jison ka sobin, jiɲuma dilanfɛɛrɛw, ni sumasicaya ma.""  This translates to: ""The future is about to be shaped by artificial intelligence, big data, and nanotechnology.""

The question asks: ""What will the future be made of?"" (Diɲɛlaminitɔnba waatiyɛlɛma ka dɛmɛ tina kɛ ka mun kɛ?)

Therefore, ""Jison ka sobin"" (the shaping of the future) is the most accurate answer. While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are components *of* what will shape the future, not the future itself.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛn ni tɛmɛsira in ye, diɲɛlaminitɔnba hakili b’ala ka mun de lakisi?","The correct answer is **C: Diɲɛkungo tɔniw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diɲɛlaminitɔnba fɛnɛ hakili b'a la ka dɛmɛ laban walasa ka dɛmɛ kɛ ka ɲɛsin jamanaw ma minnu sɛgɛra waatiyɛlɛma bolo walasa ka kɔlɔlɔw kunbɛ.""  This translates to: ""The ability to create content is now being used to share information and to communicate with people across the world and to build a global network.""

The question asks: ""What is the ability to create content being used for?""

The answer to that question is explicitly stated in the passage, and it is directly related to **Diɲɛkungo tɔniw** (Content Creation). The passage then explains that this content creation is used for sharing information, communication, and building networks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wari, baarafɛɛrɛdiw kan** (World, people) - While people are involved, the passage isn't directly asking about people themselves.
* **B: Sumasiw** (Technology) - Technology *enables* content creation, but the passage is focused on the creation itself.
* **D: Mɔgɔ minnu ma se ka jiɲuma dilanfɛɛrɛw sɔrɔ** (People who are constantly consuming information) - The passage focuses on the *creation* of information, not its consumption.



"
Ninnu fɛn jumɛnw ma fɔ Albert Muchanga fɛ inafɔ fɛn min bɛn ka kɛ min ka halisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Bɔ yɔrɔ sariyaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""anw ma bɛn halisa bɔyɔrɔ sariaw ni sɔnkɔn ka[r]iaw kan..."" which translates to ""the continent will be a market of goods and services..."".  Albert Muchanga is quoted saying this. Therefore, the answer is referring to the goods and services.



Let's break down the other options:

*   **A: N'a sɔrɔ Benin bɛ don AFCTA la** (It's about Benin being part of AFCTA): While Benin is mentioned as the place where Muchanga spoke, the question asks what he said he would be a market *of*.
*   **B: Don min sanifere tun bɛ se ka daminɛ** (It's about the continent being prosperous):  This is a general statement and not the specific thing Muchanga mentioned as a focus.
*   **D: Sɔnkɔn kariyaw** (Services provision): Services are mentioned as one of the components of the market, but ""bɔ yɔrɔ sariyaw"" (goods and services) is a broader and more accurate representation of what Muchanga emphasized.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, munna sanni-ni-feere be daminɛ zuluye kalo la?","The correct answer is **A: Zuluye kalo tali ka kɛ daminɛ waati ye tun bɛ Nigeria ka laɲini baw la walasa ka don AfCFTA la**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""anw ka baarasirataabolo bɛ wasa kɛ walasa sanni ni feere ka daminɛ zuluye kalo tile mugan san 2020"" which translates to ""the continent will be a market for goods and services, and will be a major source of revenue for Nigeria as a result of the AFCFTA in 2020.""  

Option A accurately reflects this statement. It connects the revenue generation for Nigeria to the AFCFTA. The other options are either too general (C) or repeat information already stated (B, D).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Atlanta Sariyakolo Kunnafonidila ye mun fɔ kalanko ɲɛmɔgɔw ma k'u jalaki?","The correct answer is **D: Sɛgɛsɛgɛli jaabiw dɔgɔmanw laseli**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Atilanta Sariyakolo Kunnafonidila ye sɛbɛn dɔ bɔ min be gɛlɛya yira sɛgɛsɛgɛli jaabiw la.""  This translates to ""The Atlanta police department started to investigate the disappearances of young girls.""  The investigation was *because* of the missing young girls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Atilanta Sariyakolo Kunnafonidila ka jaabi lanɔgɔli** - This means ""The Atlanta police department is investigating the neighborhood."" The text doesn't say they are investigating the neighborhood generally.
* **B: Dɛsɛli ka duguba kalanko ɲɛkurayali kɛ** - This translates to ""They are trying to solve the mystery."" While solving the mystery is the goal, the text focuses on the investigation into the missing girls.
* **C: Fɛn kɛ baliya kɔnɔ na gɛlɛyaw la** - This means ""They are looking for clues in the girls' belongings.""  The text doesn't explicitly mention searching belongings.



"
"Ka sinsin kunnafoniw kan ni tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, fɛn jumɛn tun ma fɔ Atilanta Sariyakolo Kunnafonidi sɛbɛn kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **B: Daliluw mun ba jira ko sɛbɛnw ninnu tun lanɔgɔ la** (The reason is that the same police officers were involved in the shooting).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sɛbɛn in y'a yira ko sɛgɛsɛgɛli jaabiw yɛlɛla cogo la min ma faamu, w'a y'a fɔ ko kalanso in y'a don gundola nk'a ma fɛn kɛ.

(The same police officers were involved in the shooting, and the reason is that the police officers involved, including officer Hall, had been involved in 34 previous shootings, with 12 resulting in deaths in 2013.)

* **Option B directly reflects this information.** It points to the shared involvement of the same police officers in previous shootings as the reason for the current situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sɛgɛsɛgɛli jaabi taali ɲɛfɛ min tɛ deli ka kɛ** (The police officers were simply involved in a deadly shooting). This is too general and doesn't explain *why* this particular shooting is significant.
* **C: San 2013 Jamana ka San Ɲɛmɔgɔ Jɔnjɔn ta baga** (The same police officers were involved in a shooting in 2013). While the passage mentions a shooting in 2013, it doesn't say the *same* officers were involved.
* **D: Duguba kɔnɔ kalanko ɲɛkurayali hakilinaw** (The police officers are under investigation). The passage mentions an investigation, but doesn't highlight it as the *reason* for the similarity to previous shootings.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kunnafoni jumɛn dɔnna bɔmu cilen kɔfɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Madimini laban jate (Eight minutes later)**.

The text states: ""Kunafoni dɔw ye mɔgɔsekisulakodɔni yira ni kasara in na, ani ɲɛmɔgɔw y'a sɛbɛnciya kase mɔgɔw 30 madimini ma, nka hakɛ laban ma dɔ halisa."" This translates to: ""The phone rings and the user answers, and the users work for 30 minutes, but eight minutes later they make a break.""

Therefore, the break happens **eight minutes** after they start working.
"
"Kabini a taara Manchester City la San 2017, Jesus zuyera siyɛn joli?","The correct answer is **A: 24**.

The question asks how many matches Jesus played for Palmeiras before joining Manchester City. The text states: ""Bresil ka den y'a yɛrɛyira maci 53 la kulɔbu ye ntolantankɛ a bɛɛ la ani a ye bi 24 don."" This translates to ""In Brazil, he played 53 matches for the club before being transferred, of which 24 were...""  The sentence is incomplete, but the number 24 is associated with the matches played *before* the transfer. Since the question is about matches played before joining Manchester City, and 24 is the number associated with that, it's the correct answer.
"
Ntolantan kulu jumɛn ye dolari wari miliyɔn 27 di Jesus ma walasa a ka na?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The question asks where Jesus transferred to for $27 million. The text states ""A san 21 Jesus taara Manchester City la salon zanwuye kalo san 2017 ka Bresil club Palmeriras dolari wari miliyɔn 27 dɔ kofɔni nɔfɛ."" This translates to ""In 2017, Jesus transferred from Brazil club Palmeiras to Manchester City for $27 million.""
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn dunanjigisow kan tɛ tiɲɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Dunanw tun bɛ Makan Hiji kama** (The people were from Mecca on Hajj).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dunanjigiso dɔ benna Makan nɛkɛ 10 waati min ye silamɛyasinsindugu ye."" (The Dunajigiso were from Mecca, about 10 days away by camel caravan.)  The question asks *who* the Dunajigiso were.  The answer directly states they were from Mecca on Hajj.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dunan dɔw tun tɛ sigida la mɔgɔw ye** (The people were known for their bravery). While the Dunajigiso might have been brave, the text doesn't provide that information.
* **C: Dunan dɔw tun bɛ yen hiji ɲɛkɔrɔla la** (The people were very devout in their Hajj).  Again, the text doesn't state the level of their devotion.
* **D: Dunanw fanba bɔra dugu sanuman in na** (The people were very wealthy). The text doesn't mention their wealth.

Therefore, option A is the only answer directly supported by the text.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasen jumɛn ye tiɲɛn ye?","The correct answer is **B: Dunaw bɛɛ tun ye Emira Arabes Unis jamanadenw ye**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Dunajigiso in dunaw tilan bɛɛ tun ye Emira Arabes Unis jamanadenw ye."" which translates to ""The Danube River was once the river of the Emirates of the United Arab Emirates.""
* The question asks: ""What is the most accurate information?""
* Option B directly reflects a factual statement made in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maasiba ko foyi tun tɛ yen (The people are very poor):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the economic status of the people.
* **C: Dunanw tun bɛ ye hiji surunyani (The rivers were holy rivers):** While the Danube might have historical or cultural significance, the passage doesn't explicitly state it was a ""holy river"" in a religious sense.  It mentions its history related to the Emirates.
* **D: Dunanw fan caman tun ye Makan dugudenw ye (Rivers were like the rivers of Mecca):** The passage doesn't make any comparison between the Danube and the rivers of Mecca.



"
"Ka da ni tɛmɛsira in kan, kunnafoni jumɛn bɛ gasili in kan min bɛ filan filan na?","This is a tricky question! Let's break it down.

* **The first part (P) describes a satellite and its capabilities.** It's a scientific description of a high-speed satellite.  It's largely irrelevant to the second part.

* **The second part (Q) is in a language that isn't immediately recognizable as English.** It appears to be a combination of phonetic sounds and words. This strongly suggests it's not a straightforward question requiring logical deduction based on the satellite information. It's likely a distorted or coded phrase.

* **The options (A-D) also appear to be in the same unidentified language as the question.**  Without knowing the language, we can't definitively choose the correct answer.

**However, let's look for clues.** The question seems to be asking about a connection (""kan"") and a service (""gasili""). The words ""min bɛ filan filan"" could possibly relate to files or information.

**Given the limited information and the foreign language nature of the question and options, there's no *correct* answer.**  We are simply guessing.

**If I had to *guess* the *most plausible* answer based on the fragments, I'd lean towards C: Gasili kɔlɔlɔ Dugukolo sanfɛ.** This option has the most syllables and the most structure which is just a guess based on observation.

**Therefore, my answer is C, but with a huge disclaimer that I'm guessing due to the lack of language understanding.**



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn de ka kan ka sidɔn ka ɲɛsin gasili in ma?","The question in the second part (Q) is in a different language (likely a fictional or coded language).  Let's analyze it, even though we don't know the language.  It seems to be asking something about a time period and a location (possibly a place name).  The options (A-D) are also in the same language.

Without knowing the language, it's *impossible* to definitively choose the correct answer. However, we can make an educated guess based on the context of the first part.

The first part discusses a satellite, its speed, and its distance, and mentions the United States Strategic Command. This suggests a context involving technology, space, and potentially military applications.

Option B: ""Satellite tun bɛ ka teliya cogodi gasili kɛ waati"" translates roughly to ""Satellite has been to the Earth, a satellite to a gas/fuel/energy"". This option connects the satellite with a journey to Earth and something related to energy or fuel.  This *somewhat* fits with the technological context of the first part.

The other options don't seem to fit as well without knowing the language.

**Therefore, the most plausible answer, *given the limited information and the fact that we are guessing at a coded language*, is B.**

**Important Disclaimer:** This answer is highly speculative.  A translation of the second question is needed for a certain answer.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, Batten tun delila ka jɔyɔrɔ jumɛn sɔrɔ Ameriki Nafolotigibaw ka lisi sanfɛ ?","The correct answer is **C: 190nan**.

The question asks how many years it took for Batten to become a top 400 on the American Track and Field list. The passage states: ""Batten tun be jɔyɔrɔ 190 nan de la Amerikika 400 minw ye nafolotigiba san 2008 lisi kan ni a nafolo hakƐ be se dolari wari miliyari 2,3 ma."" This translates to ""Batten became top 190 on the American 400m list by the 2008 list, and the prize money was $2.3 billion.""

Therefore, the answer is 190.
"
Batten tun ye dɛmɛ do ninnu fɛn jumɛnw ma?,"The correct answer is **A: Amerikikaw ka nafolotigiw lisi**.

Here's why:

The first sentence states: ""Batten tun be jɔyɔrɔ 190 nan de la Amerikika 400 minw ye nafolotigiba san 2008 lisi kan ni a nafolo hakƐ be se dolari wari miliyari 2,3 ma.""  This translates to: ""Batten tun (something) was the 190th in the list of 400 most innovative companies in America in 2008, and it had a value of 2.3 billion dollars.""

The question asks: ""Batten tun ye dɛmɛ do ninnu fɛn jumɛnw ma?"" which translates to: ""What was Batten tun among them?""  The sentence directly states that Batten tun was **in the list of 400 most innovative companies in America**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Virginia Sanfɛkalansoba:** This is mentioned as a historical fact, but not what Batten tun *was*.
* **C: Kalankɛyɔrɔ nafama caman:**  This translates to ""The company and its products,"" which isn't a direct answer to the question about *what* Batten tun was *among* the other companies.
* **D: Kalanyɔrɔw minnu ɲɛsin bɛ sekow ni dɔnni kalan ma:** This translates to ""The old companies that were founded by families,"" which is a general description, but not what Batten tun specifically *was*.



"
Fɛn jumɛn sen tɛ sariyalaɲini in kɔnɔ min ni Maraɲɛmɔgɔ Arnold Schwarzenegger ye bolonɔn bila a la?,"The correct answer is **C: Cɛnni-jeux videos feereli walima a singali kɔnni denmisɛn kɔkɔbaluw ma Californie kɔfɛ**

Here's why:

* The question asks what Arnold Schwarzenegger did *in California* related to video games.
* The text states he ""feere Californie kɔnɔ ka tamasiɲɛn ni """"18"""" ye min bɛ u feereli ɲanki dɛmisɛnifitiniw ma ni dolari wari 1000 ye a sɔsɔli kelen na."" This translates to ""he released in California a game with a rating of '18' which earned him a profit of 1000 dollars and its derivatives.""
* Option C accurately reflects this by saying he released a video game in California.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cɛnni-jeux videos feereli walima a singali kɔnni denmisɛn kɔkɔbaluw ma Californie kɔnɔ** - This is a repetition of part of the correct answer and isn't as specific.
* **B: Ɲankili wari min bɛ sara sɔsɔlibagaw fɛ** - This translates to ""the amount of money that was earned"". While the text mentions money, the question isn't about the money itself.
* **D: Tamasiɲɛn tali cɛnni-jeux videos kama** - This translates to ""He just released a video game"". While true, it doesn't specify *where* he released it, which is crucial to the question.



Therefore, **C** is the most precise and correct answer.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn ma kumadɔw mɛn minnu fɔra?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""Mike be kuma kɔsɛbɛ lamɛni tuma... N tun be ka n labɛn ola ne tun ma labɛn kɔsɛbɛ k'a mɛn a tun be ka min fɔ"" which translates to ""Mike is [doing] something... And we were doing something and we were doing something that we were doing for me."" This is Miller talking and addressing Mike. Therefore, Miller is the one who said the quoted sentence.

The question is asking who said the quoted sentence, and that is Miller.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu fɛn jumɛnw bɛ tiɲɛn ye Miller ka lamɛnni kɛli la?","The correct answer is **A: Duvall ye Miller dabali ban lamɛnni tuma na**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Mike be kuma kɔsɛbɛ lamɛni tuma... N tun be ka n labɛn ola ne tun ma labɛn kɔsɛbɛ k'a mɛn a tun be ka min fɔ.""  This translates to: ""Mike was supposed to come and work... We thought he would come and work because we thought he would help us.""  Duvall is saying they *expected* Miller to come and work, and that their reliance was on that expectation.

* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: A tun tɛ k’a lamɛn kɔsɛbɛ tuma min a tun bɛ k’a labɛn:**  This translates roughly to ""We thought he was supposed to come and work because we thought he was going to help us.""  While close, it doesn't capture the core meaning of Duvall's statement that they *counted on* Miller.
    * **C: Duvall den fila tun kumana kosɛbɛ lamɛnni tuma:** This translates to ""Duvall and his group were supposed to come and work."" This isn't what Duvall is saying; he is expressing disappointment/confusion about Miller.
    * **D: A tun tɛ ka Duvall ka kokɔrɔ laseli lamɛn kosɛbɛ:** This translates to ""We thought Duvall's group would help work.""  This doesn't align with Duvall's complaint about Miller's absence.

Therefore, option A accurately reflects Duvall's primary point: they were depending on Miller to come and work.



"
Jɔnni ye ‘Fiyɛn Jɛlen Sariyasen’ in yɛlɛmani laɲini kɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: John Howard**.

The text states: ""Minisiri Ɲɛmɔgɔ John Howard ye a fɔ ko sariyasen in tun ye dɔrɔn marabaaw kana kɛnɛyaso in daraja jigin ni AUD$ miliyɔn 45 farakan dili ye.""  This translates to ""Prime Minister John Howard was the first to offer the government's support in the form of a major donation of AUD$45 million.""  The donation was *for* the ""Fiyɛn Jɛlen Sariyasen"" (Gen Len's Memorial). Therefore, John Howard was the one involved in offering support for the memorial.
"

The text states: ""Minisiri Ɲɛmɔgɔ Stephen Harper sɔnna ka jamana ɲɛmogow ka """" Fiyɛn Jɛlen Sariyasen""""..."" which translates to ""Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the government's ""Lenin's Dream""...""  Therefore, the Prime Minister (Minisiri Ɲɛmɔgɔ) made the announcement.
"
Acide cyanurique ni melamine bɛ fɛn jumɛn di n'u ɲakamina ɲɔgɔn na jakuma sugunɛ la ?,"The correct answer is **C: Kisɛkisɛniw**.

Translation: ""The result is determined. The result is determined by the presence of crystalline substances of melamine and cyanuric acid in the sample.""

Therefore, the test relies on detecting **crystalline substances (kisɛkisɛniw)** to identify the presence of melamine and cyanuric acid.
"
Koɲɛɲininaw tun ye baara kɛ nin infrares rouges ye ka fɛn jumɛn lajɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kisɛkisɛni faralen ɲɔgɔn ka sokonɔ bagan sukunɛ na**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ni kisɛkisɛni ninnu farani ɲɔgɔn kan bɛ bɛn ni minnu sɔrɔ la sokonɔnbagansukunɛ na n'a sanganna infrares rouges (FTIR) la."" This translates to: ""And the different kinds of impurities are found in the substance by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

This means infrared spectroscopy is used to identify the *impurities* within the substance, which are the ""kisɛkisɛni faralen ɲɔgɔn"" (impurities of the color/dye).  The FTIR is *used* to detect these impurities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sugunɛbara ka baara (The impurities are burnt):** The text doesn't mention burning.
*   **C: Sokɔnɔbagan bananenw (The impurities are a certain kind of substance):** While impurities *are* substances, this is too general. The text focuses on identifying specific *types* of impurities, not just that they are substances.
*   **D: Sokɔnɔbagan dumunibagaman (The impurities are a certain kind of compound):** Similar to C, this is too broad.  The text details the identification of *specific* impurities.



"
Jɔni tun ye Luna weele ko “Extreme ka Masamuso”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tommy Dreamer ko """"Luna tun ye Extreme ka Masamuso ye."""" This translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said """"Luna is the Extreme Masamuso.""""

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who referred to Luna as ""Extreme Masamuso"".
"
Jɔni tun ye Luna weele ko “mɔgɔfamuyabali”?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels y'a hakilina di ko """"Luna tun ye mɔgɔfamubali ye i n'a fɔ ne... hali ka tɛmɛ ne kan...a ko kadi ne ye ani a bɛ na ɲɛnafin bila ne la... ne dara a la k'a b'a boloɲuman kan."""" which translates to ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels said that """"Luna is a great man... he was a very good person... he always wanted to be a wrestler... and he always did his best.""""

Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who called Luna a ""mɔgɔfamubali"" (great man).
"
Mɔbili min tun ye kasara kɛ mun tun ma o mɔbilibolila in sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: A banana a kunkulo la** (The one that is of the oldest is).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mɔgɔ saba tun be so in kɔnɔ waati minna mobili in y'a gosi nka u si ma bana."" This translates to: ""Seven people all bought cars, the one whose age is the oldest is the one who doesn't drive.""

Then the text continues with details about the car bought by the oldest person.

The question asks ""Mɔbili min tun ye kasara kɛ mun tun ma o mɔbilibolila in sɔrɔ?"" which translates to ""Which car did the oldest person buy?"".

The answer is directly stated in the first sentence: ""A banana a kunkulo la"" - the oldest one.  The rest of the text details that person's car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mɔgɔ minnuw tun be so in kɔnɔ a ma olu si bana** (The people who bought cars are those who don't drive) - This is a restatement of the initial premise, not the car itself.
* **C: A yɛlɛmara kura ye ka bɔ kɛnɛyaso dɔ la min be Cambridge ka ta kɛnɛyaso dɔwɛrɛ la min be Great Yarmouth** (The oldest one bought a car and went to a hospital in Cambridge and then to a hospital in Great Yarmouth) - This describes the oldest person's actions *after* buying the car, not the car itself.
* **D: Tulomagɛn cakɛdaw y’a dɛmɛ ka bɔ mɔbili in kɔnɔ** (The oldest person bought the car) - While true, it's not the *name* or *description* of the car. The question is asking *what car* was bought.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately identifies the car the oldest person bought, as the text states the oldest one is the one who doesn't drive and then describes their car.
"
Fɛn jumɛn tun te ye South Afrika ka ntolatancogo la rugby ɲɔgɔndan waati la?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntolantan cɛɲi ɲɔgɔndan daminɛ la** (The current world champions).

Here's why:

The text states: ""South Afrika nĩyeyũkĩrĩirie o mathako magĩthiaga nambere.""  This translates to ""South Africa remained at the top of the rankings.""  The following sentence describes their strength and dominance. The question asks *why* South Africa is the current world champions (implied by ""ka ntolatancogo la rugby""). Option C directly states that they are the current world champions.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, South Afrika ka ntolantancogo yɛlɛmana ka ɲɛn waati ɲuman na?","The correct answer is **A: Sɔgɔma nɛgɛ kanya 10:00 waati**.

The text states: ""Athaki ngũthi a South Afrika maajirie mathako na mũthiĩre mwega rĩrĩa maahũrire timu ya Zambia 26- 00 ĩrĩa yarĩ namba ithano mũthakoinĩ."" This implies the match happened at a specific time, and option A is the only one offering a time.  The text doesn't give specific details about where it was played, or other details.

The other options are irrelevant:

* **B: Celukɔlɔsili kologɛlɛyalen** - This is gibberish.
* **C: U jigitigɛlen kɔfɛ Zanbi fɛ** - This refers to the Zambian team, not the match time.
* **D: Ɲɔgɔndan tun be sena waati min** -  This translates to ""The game doesn't have minutes"", which is nonsensical in this context.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasen jumɛn kelen te Sini jamana ka sɔrɔbosoni jira a cogo yɛrɛ la?","The correct answer is **A: Sini jamana sɔrɔ yiriwara yɔrɔninkelen kabinni yɛlɛmaw kera.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the main reason for the rapid rise of China's economy in recent years?""
* **The provided text states:** ""Sɔrɔboso yɛlɛmabolo fɔlɔ in kɛra Deng Xiaoping ka fanga kɔnɔ.""  This translates to ""The reformist leader who followed Deng Xiaoping's path.""  The text then goes on to describe how this leader initiated economic reforms, leading to rapid growth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sini jamana be mɔbili canman labɔ ka feere ka tɛmɛ Ameriki jamana kan:**  ""China is able to export to the American market."" While export is a part of China's economy, it doesn't explain the *rapid rise* in the first place.
* **C: Sini jamana ka GDP be se ka boɲa ni Ameriki jamana ta ye taalenɲɛfɛ:** ""China's GDP is very large, and it is a major economic power.""  GDP size is a *result* of economic growth, not the *reason* for the growth.
* **D: Sini furadama ma mobili caman labɔ ka fere ka tɛmɛ Alimaɲa jamana kan:** ""China's products are able to export to the German market.""  Similar to B, this describes export, not the fundamental reason for the economic surge.



Therefore, option A is the only one that directly addresses the core of the question, highlighting the role of reformist leadership in driving China's economic boom.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati juman Sini jamana GDP bena se ka tɛmɛ Ameriki jamana ta la?","The correct answer is **D: San tan sigiyɔrɔma saba kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Sini jamana GDP be se ka boɲa ni Ameriki ta ye yani san tan sigiyɔrɔma fila la.""  This translates to: ""China's GDP is now greater than America's total.""
* The question asks *how* China's GDP became greater than America's.
* The text directly answers that it happened because of ""san tan sigiyɔrɔma saba kɔnɔ"" which translates to ""the new policies"" or ""the reforms"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sɔrɔbonson yɛlɛmaw kɔfɛ** (The economic reforms were effective) - While the reforms *were* effective, the text doesn't say that *effectiveness* is the reason. It's the *reforms themselves* that are the cause.
* **B: San tan sigiyɔrɔma fila kɔnɔ** (Total reform) -  The text mentions reforms, but doesn't specify it was a *total* reform.
* **C: Ni jamana be mɔgɔ kura ka fanga kɔnɔ** (The country has a strong leadership to guide it) - While leadership is important, the text focuses on the economic reforms as the driving force.



"
Hu tun y’a fɔ ko ɲɛtaa jamanaw be se ka mun kɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: K’u jagoya fɛn na min b’u ka ɲɛtaa lase sanfɛ**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Nk' u mankan k'u jagoya fɛn na min be ta u ka ɲetaa, jɔyɔrɔ ani se sanfɛ.""  This translates to ""We have to use our wisdom to make the future better, joyful, and prosperous.""

* Option A directly reflects this statement by saying ""K’u jagoya fɛn na min b’u ka ɲɛtaa lase sanfɛ"" which means ""Our wisdom is used to make the future better and prosperous.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: K’u sinsin sɔrɔ bɔtaw kan** (Our foreign exchange reserves) - While foreign exchange reserves are mentioned in the first part of the text, they are not the answer to the question about what the future should be like.
* **C: Ka taa u ka sisan jɔyɔrɔw sanfɛ** (To make a prosperous and joyful future) - This is close, but option A is a more precise restatement of the wisdom needed.
* **D: Ka nɔgɔba sɔrɔsira kɔrɔw bila** (To create a broad-based economy) - This is a goal, not a description of the desired future state as expressed in the text.



"
Hu tun da ma se mun ma?,"The correct answer is **B: Ladilikan dili ka ɲɛsin ɲɛtaa jamanaw ma nɔgɔba kunkan** (The most important thing is to learn from the experiences of previous generations).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes learning from the past:** The first sentence states that GDP growth is being compared between 2020 and 2005, suggesting an analysis of past performance. The quote ""Ka nɔgɔba sɔrɔsira kɔrɔw bali fɔlɔ, k'u lajɛya o kɔfɛ"" directly translates to ""To learn from the experiences of previous generations, we must strive.""
* **The second quote reinforces this idea:** ""Nk' u mankan k'u jagoya fɛn na min be ta u ka ɲetaa, jɔyɔrɔ ani se sanfɛ"" translates to ""We must value our wisdom and use it to learn from the past, present, and future.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Songojigin hakɛ** (The analysis/study): While the passage *contains* an analysis, the main point isn't just about the analysis itself.
* **C: Sisifin jinsinni be na se ka dɔgɔya waati min** (The future depends on our ability to grow):  While growth is mentioned, the passage focuses more on learning from the past than solely on future growth.
* **D: Jateden dɔ sinsinfin jinsinni hakɛ dɔgɔyali** (The progress of the modern future depends on the growth of the modern nation): Similar to C, this focuses on the future, not the core message of learning from past experiences.

"Ka sabu kɛ nɔminɛli ye, jɔn bena Huhne jɔyɔrɔ t’a ka baarayɔrɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Huhne demisiyɔnnera wa a bɛ na nɔɔrɔbila a ka baarayɔrɔ la ni Wasaden Ed Davey ye."" This translates to ""The Huhne nominators were nominated by Ed Davey."" Therefore, Ed Davey nominated Huhne.
"

The text states: ""Huhne Norman Lamp min makɔnɔnen do ka Davey nɔnabila jamana ni jamana wɛrɛw cɛ-Minisiriso la ni a lankolon do fɔlɔ."" This translates to: ""Norman Lamp, a former Prisons and Local Communities Minister, is expected to testify after Davey."" Therefore, Norman Lamb is the former Prisons and Local Communities Minister mentioned.

The original text says: ""...min ka diɲɛnatikɛ fanba bɛɛ bɛnni do furaw ni Zapɔn kanu ma.""  This translates to ""...it [the thing being pulled] is the future of the world, even surpassing Japan.""

The question asks: ""What did Camille Sèans say about the future of the world?""

The answer is that he said it was related to the future of the world. Option D accurately reflects this statement.  Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: K’u sen do ɲɛnaminisisimin la** (It is the minister of the people): This doesn't match the content of the sentence.
*   **B: Ka ta waati kɛ Zapɔn** (That it surpasses Japan): While the sentence mentions surpassing Japan, it's not the core of what Camille Sèans said *about* the future. It's a detail of what the future *is*.
*   **C: Ka fara u kan minnin na** (That it is like a dream):  This is not mentioned in the original sentence.

Therefore, only option D correctly states the main point of Camille Sèans' statement according to the text.
"
Jɔni kelen be ɲɛnaminisisi min fɔli-ni-dɔnkilida senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Sekonidɔnkoditigilamɔgɔ (Second violin)**.

The passage states: ""Camille Saint-Saens fɛ, ye sekonidɔnkotigilamɔgɔ dɔ ta ye..."" which translates to ""Camille Saint-Saens was, he was the second violin...""

Therefore, the question asks who Camille Saint-Saens was, and the answer is ""sekonidɔnkotigilamɔgɔ"" which means ""second violin"".
"
Leonov tun ye “dugukolokɔkan taama” min kɛ o tɔgɔ dɔwɛrɛ ye juman ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Apollo-Soyuz cikulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""San tan tɛmɛni kɔ, a tun ye Union Sovietique Appollo-Soyuz cikulu ye, min tun b'a yira ko Dugukolokɔkan ɲɔgɔdan banna.""  This translates to ""Later, he participated in the Soviet Union's Apollo-Soyuz cycle, where they docked with an American spacecraft.""

While Leonov was known as ""Cosmonaut No. 11"" and performed a spacewalk (""pankurunbaara""), the question asks about the *cycle* or mission he participated in *later* in his career. The passage explicitly states he was part of the Apollo-Soyuz cycle.



"
Leonov bilara Union Sovietique ka cikulu juman ɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""San tan tɛmɛni kɔ, a tun ye Union Sovietique Appollo-Soyuz cikulu ye, min tun b'a yira ko Dugukolokɔkan ɲɔgɔdan banna."" This translates to: ""Later, he was part of the Union Soviet Apollo-Soyuz cycle, where he docked with the American spacecraft.""

Therefore, Leonov participated in the Apollo-Soyuz cycle.
"
Jɔn tun mandimina kasara in la?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""Gibson taara ka taa dɔkɔtɔrɔso dɔ la, ɲa a saara waatini o kɔfɛ."" This translates to ""Gibson went to the doctor, and he got a cough.""  The question asks who had a cough. Therefore, the answer is Gibson.
"
Mun tun ye kasara in kɛbaw sɔrɔw?,"The correct answer is **C: U tun be kule ni kasi la**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""U bɛɛ bolira ka segi u kɔ ka bɔ kasara in kɛyɔrɔ la."" which translates to ""He said he would go and find the person who had stolen the money.""
* **The question asks:** ""Who stole the money?"" (Mun tun ye kasara in kɛbaw sɔrɔw?)
* **The text then says:** ""Demisɛni dɔw tun jɔni do sira tigɛ la minnu tun bɛ kule ni kasi la."" which translates to ""The person had been looking for the thief for a long time, and he had been searching and asking around.""

Therefore, the person who stole the money is the one the speaker was looking for and searching for - ""U tun be kule ni kasi la"" (He had been searching and asking around).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U fila bɛɛ sara** (Someone had been looking) - This is true, but not who stole the money.
* **B: Kelen tun ma madimi, kelen sara** (He had been looking for a long time, he was searching) - This describes the process, not the identity of the thief.
* **D: U fila bɛɛ farikolofanw dɔw mandimina** (Someone had been looking for the thief) - This is close to the correct answer, but ""U tun be kule ni kasi la"" is more specific to the act of searching and asking questions *because* of the theft.

Dɔnikɛla minnuw be ka baara kɛ tabolo in kan olu tun b’a laɲini ka nin fɛn jumanw kelen fanga filɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Fɛn misɛnmanninw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hakilinasira in ko fɛn fima fanba dolokulu lamini la be ye dolokulu lamini la kori sugu dɔ kɔnɔ, w'a kɛlendon ni fɛn misɛnmanninw ye.""  This translates to: ""The star, which is a star that is also a very bright star, is also a star that moves in a very fast direction, and it is a star that is a very distant star.""

The question asks what the star's light is made of. The passage directly states the light is made of **fɛn misɛnmanninw** which translates to **distant stars**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fɛn gansan (dust):** The passage doesn't mention dust as a component of the light.
* **B: Dolokulu (galaxy):** While the star is *in* a galaxy, the light itself isn't made of the galaxy.
* **D: Fɛn finmanw (bright stars):** While the star *is* bright, the passage describes its light as originating from distant stars, not simply bright stars.

Therefore, **Fɛn misɛnmanninw (distant stars)** is the accurate answer.



"
Dɔninkɛlaw tun be ka nin fɛnw juman kelen filɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagittarius dolokulu ni Milky Way**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kulu in ka laɲini nɔ tun ye dolokulu taanikasegin fangaw fɛn fimaw ni dolokulu Milky Way tonkulu fɛn fimaw ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ Inafɔ kalo be samanifanga lawaleya dugu kolo kan cogo min, n'o be nani samasamani ye, o cogo kelen in de la dolokulu Milky Way be samasamani fanga dɔ lawaleya Sagittarius dolokulu kan.""

This translates to: ""The group is very close and is a star cluster in the Milky Way galaxy, in the halo of the Local Group, in the direction of the Sagittarius galaxy, which is a dwarf galaxy of the Milky Way.""

The question asks what the group is close to. The text explicitly says it's close to both the Sagittarius galaxy *and* the Milky Way.
"
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, kɔnsɛriwatiwu ka kɔrɔfɔw tun ma se fɛn jumɛn kan?","The correct answer is **A: Lafiyada wari bɔta** (Waterborne diseases).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What was the main health problem that emerged after Hurricane Katrina?
* **The provided text states:** ""Barow ganan ni fɔɲɔgɔkɔ ye min ye ka lafiyada dɔ ci ani yɔrɔw jɔli kuraya fiyɛnkolonba Katrina tɛmɛnen kɔ..."" which translates to ""The main problem [after] the hurricane was diseases caused by contaminated water...""
* **Option A, ""Lafiyada wari bɔta"" (Waterborne diseases),** directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yɔrɔw jɔli kura wilikajɔ tan yan (The strong wind and rain):** While the hurricane caused strong winds and rain, the text focuses on the *health consequences* of the disaster, specifically water contamination.
* **C: Jɔn ye jɔli kura dili saratiw sɔrɔ (Other diseases):** The text specifically mentions diseases caused by contaminated water, not just any other diseases.
* **D: Jɔli kura wari bɔta (Water contamination):** While water contamination was a factor, the text states the *result* of contamination was diseases, making ""Waterborne diseases"" a more accurate description of the main health problem.



"
Jɔn bɛ ka kɔrɔfɔw kɛ jɔli kura saratiw kan mun bɛ ɲɛsin fiyɛnkolonba Katrina lafiyada wilikajɔw ma?,"The correct answer is **C: Bush**.

The passage states: ""...nisɔngɔ lasɔnba dɔw y'a tɔgɔ da ni yɛlɛko ye ko Bush New Orleans Benkan Jɔliko kurayali in timinandiya foroba kɔrɔfɔw y'u sinsin jɔli kura dili saratiw kan k'a di Washington kɔnɔ mɔgɔw ma"" which translates to ""...the response of the administration under Bush in New Orleans and the federal government in Washington to the disaster.""

The question asks who was involved in the response to Hurricane Katrina. The passage explicitly mentions ""Bush"" in connection with the response.  The other options are either too general (Sɔrɔko kɔnsɛriwatiwu - conservative, Liberalisiw - liberals, Washington kɔnɔ mɔgɔw - Washington government) or not directly supported by the text.

This translates to: ""The journey took about 12.8 hours at a speed of 8 boli per second, meaning it took about San Francisco to Los Angeles minutes. The journey was about the California corridor, where the trajectory passed from California to Oregon through the center and Nevada and Idaho to Utah.""

Therefore, Oregon through the center is mentioned as part of the trajectory.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, pankuru in bɛna kɛ dan kura ye ninnu jumɛn man?","The correct answer is **D: Ka bɔ SanFiransisiko ka taa Lɔsangelɛsi teliya dan na**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kapisili in bɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ 12,8 walema 8 boli segondi kɔnɔ, min teliya ye ka bɔ SanFiransisiko ka taa Lɔsangelɛsi miniti kelen kɔnɔ.""

This translates to: ""The capsule is 12.8 kilometers away, traveling at 8 times the speed of sound, which is a distance that connects San Francisco to Los Angeles in minutes.""

Option D directly reflects this information. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Ka yeelen mɛnɛ sankolo yɔrɔ fɛrɛlen ba la** - While true the capsule is traveling faster than sound, this option doesn't capture the main point about the distance between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
*   **B: Ka se ka ye duguw fan ba fɛ** - This option is too vague and doesn't specify what is being described.
*   **C: Segili dugu kolo sanfɛ teliya dan na** - This option only talks about the capsule speed and does not mention the distance between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Sira jumɛn tun bɛ Dr. Malar Balasubramanian ani Saroja Balasubramanian cɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Bamuso**.

The text states: ""Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, san 29 , tun yera duguma sira kɛrɛfɛ ni T-shirt ani kulusisurumanni dɔ ye a tun b'i n'a fɔ a tun ɲɛgannen do do furakɛli la Blue Ash, Ohio, min ye kiin ye Cincinnati kɔrɔn masurun na.

This translates to: ""Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, who is 29 years old, is a police officer wearing a T-shirt and trousers, and he chased after a car that had been speeding for 500 meters in Blue Ash, Ohio, which is a suburb of Cincinnati. He is following a policy of chasing down speeding cars. Then, he is Saroja Balasubramanian, who is 53 years old, his mother, and she is very happy. The police chased after him because he was speeding.""

The text explicitly says ""Saroja Balasubramanian su sɔrɔ yen"" which means ""Saroja Balasubramanian is his mother."" Therefore, they are mother and son, which is ""Bamuso"" (mother-son).



"

The text states: ""A bilala polɔsiɲɛɲinikɛlaw ɲɛ ka taa a ka mɔbilikɔrɔdogodogoni yɔrɔ la min tun bɛ nɔngɔn ɲɛ 500 bɔ."" and later ""Yen, u ye Saroja Balasubramanian su sɔrɔ yen, san 53, a dabirilen tun do ni birifiniw ye minw bɛɛ tun ye joli ye."" This indicates that Saroja Balasubramanian is a teacher (sira kɛrɛfɛ).

Fɛn jumɛn sɔrɔ la eBay fɛ?,"The answer is **C: Skype**.

The question asks what company eBay was acquired by. The text states: ""O ye ladilikanbelebeleba ye EBay ka masala la.

This translates to: ""eBay was acquired by a company. It is a communication platform used by people in China, Europe, and Brazil.""

Skype is a well-known communication platform. The other options (Microsoft, Apple, Zoom) are related to technology but not the direct answer to what company acquired eBay, based on the provided text.  The text *implies* communication, and Skype is the best fit among the choices.


**Important Note:** This question is a bit of a trick because the text is poorly written and grammatically incorrect, making it difficult to understand.  eBay was actually acquired by **Microsoft**. However, based *solely* on the provided text, Skype is the more logical choice.
"
Fɛn jumɛn de kɛli laɲinnen do ni ladilikan in ye?,"The correct answer is **C: K'a ka porofili bonyan**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* people like eBay.** The passage states that eBay is popular because it ships to many countries (China, Europe, Brazil).
* **Option C (K'a ka porofili bonyan - ""Because of its user-friendly profile"")** is the most logical reason for its popularity. A user-friendly profile (meaning easy to use and navigate) would contribute significantly to a positive shopping experience and thus, increased popularity.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: K'a ka sɔrɔ in sinsin (Because of its newness):** While eBay isn't brand new, its long-standing presence isn't the primary reason for its current popularity.
* **B: Ka jɛnsɛn ka taa sigi yɔrɔ kuraw kan (Because of its high quality of products):** The passage doesn't mention the quality of products as a reason for eBay's popularity.
* **D: K'a ka baarayɔrɔtigiw nimisiwasa (Because of its diverse selection of items):** While eBay *does* have a diverse selection, the passage highlights its shipping reach more directly.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer is **C**."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, jɔn tun ma kumaɲɔgɔnya ni kasodenw ye minnu tun bɛ dukɛnɛ na kɛlɛ ban ne?","The correct answer is **A: Cɛkanfɔlaw**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cɛkanfɔlaw y'a ɲini ka ko latilen, nka kasodenw ka laɲiniw tun ma jɛya."" This translates to: ""The [traditional healers/herbalists] are known for their knowledge, so the medicines they use are effective.""

The question asks who the people consulted for medicine. The text directly links the effectiveness of the medicines to the knowledge of the *cɛkanfɔlaw* (traditional healers/herbalists).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tasumafagalaw:** (The herbal medicine gatherers) - While they gather the herbs, they aren't the primary ones consulted for medical advice.
*   **C: Lakanatigilamɔgɔw:** (The traditional medicine dispensers) -  This group isn't mentioned as being consulted.
*   **D: Dɔkɔtɔrɔso baarakɛlaw:** (The biomedical doctors) - The text doesn't mention consulting doctors. The focus is on traditional medicine.



"
Ninnu fɛn jumɛnw tun kɛra sababu ye a dɔ la ka kasodenw ka murutili la sa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kasoden madiminenw u kasodenɲɔgɔnw fɛ (The medicine and the wound are infected).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sufɛ nɛgɛ ɲɛ 10 ni 11 cɛ tasuma mɛnɛna kasodukɛnɛ kɔnɔ kasodenw fɛ. Sɔɔni, lakanatigilamɔgɔ dɔw donna dukɛnɛ na ni jamacariminaw ye ka kasodenw degun ni ɲɛjibɔgazi ye.""

Translation: ""For 10 or 11 days, the wound did not heal, and the medicine made the wound infected. Therefore, the traditional healers and the medical doctors said that the wound was infected and had pus.""

Therefore, the infection of the wound due to the medicine is the reason for the lack of healing.

"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hakilina la, Iran jamana kan k'a yɛrɛ bɔ siri jumɛn na?","The correct answer is **B: Silamɛyayɛlɛma**.

This translates to: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the supreme leader, has said that the Islamic revolution in Iran, which began in 1979, was based on his divine guidance.""

Therefore, the answer is **Silamɛyayɛlɛma** (Islamic Revolution).

This translates to ""But we have been talking about the oil and gas of Europe in the 20th century, but the oil of Iran is 80% of it.""  Therefore, oil and gas (kunafoniɲinijɛkulujoniw) are the primary focus of the passage regarding Iran's resources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: OPEC:** OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is mentioned as a body that controls oil prices, but it's not the *resource* being discussed.
* **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei:** He is mentioned as a political leader, but again, not the core resource.
* **D: Erɔpu Jɛkulu (European Century):** This refers to a period in history and is not the resource.



"
Ninnu jumɛn sen tɛ Faransi kalata kɛ cogow la?,"The correct answer is **D: Kalata minnu jatera cɛbɔw ka cidenw fɛ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""su fɛ, jateminɛba kɔnɔ min bɛ taa sira kɛrɛn-kɛrɛnni fɛ, kalatalaw bɛ jatɛ kelenkelen."" This translates to: ""Subsequently, the government has been implementing various measures, and the French constitution has been amended.""

The amendment to the constitution was done to allow for referendums on important issues, specifically regarding the constitution itself. This means that the constitution's power comes from the **referendums held by the citizens**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kalata kɛsu (The constitution itself):** While the constitution is *the* power source, this isn't *where* that power originates.
* **B: Cɛbɔw ka cidenw (Citizens):** While citizens are involved in referendums, the constitution doesn't *come from* the citizens alone. It's a complex relationship.
* **C: Bolonɔbilali kalata tɔgɔ gafe la (The government's current constitution):** The passage isn't focusing on the *current* constitution, but on the amendment process and the source of its power.



"
Kalatalaw bɛ u ka cɛbɔ suganti yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **C: Forokoni kɔnɔ** (Production).

The text states: ""...kalatalaw kelen bɛ taa gundosoni kɔnɔ, ka u ɲɛnamɔgɔsubantikalatasɛbɛn don foroko kɔnɔ."" This translates to ""...the power of the factory is also based on production, and the nuclear fuel is used for production.""

Therefore, the factory's power is linked to production.

* **The passage states:** ""Kumaw y'a yira ko diyɛn in waribatigi ba dɔ, Allen y'a ka nafolo ba don jijukɔrɔ ɲɛɲini la w'a ya daminɛ ka Musashi in ɲini k'a da ka diyɛnkutaala kɛlɛ ɲɛci dɔ kan.""
* **Translation:** ""When the situation worsened, Allen followed the most recent surge of the current, and went to the location where Musashi's body was, following the waves and finally finding a piece of clothing that belonged to Musashi.""

This clearly indicates that Allen followed the current and *then* found a piece of clothing, implying he followed the wave/current *to* the location of Musashi's body, and *then* found the clothing. Option C accurately reflects this sequence of actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ka nafolo:** (He followed) - This is too general. It doesn't explain *what* he followed or *why*.
* **B: A kuntala kaɲɛsin kɔkɔji jukɔrɔla jaw ma:** (He jumped to the most recent surge of the current) - He *followed* the current, not jumped to it.
* **D: A ɲɛci kaɲɛsi kɛlɛ ma:** (He found a piece of clothing) - This only describes the *result*, not the *process* of how he found it.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Allen y'a ka nafolo ba caman do fɛn jumɛn de la?","The correct answer is **B: Jijukɔrɔla ɲɛɲini**.

The text states: ""Allen y'a ka nafolo ba don jijukɔrɔ ɲɛɲini la w'a ya daminɛ ka Musashi in ɲini k'a da ka diyɛnkutaala kɛlɛ ɲɛci dɔ kan."" This translates to: ""Allen followed the very loud noise, and then went to a place where Musashi was trying to find a very high level of excitement.""

Therefore, Allen followed the loud noise (jijukɔrɔla ɲɛɲini).

This translates to: ""Japanese scientists developed a way to use Caesium Radioactive and Iodine to make atomic bombs. People used a type of Uranium to make a chain reaction that produced a lot of energy.""

Therefore, the text explicitly links **Uranium (iraniyɔmu tajibara)** to the chain reaction that made atomic bombs. While Caesium and Iodine were *used* in the bombs, Uranium was the fuel that initiated and sustained the reaction.
"
Ninnu fɛn jumɛn tɛ lakana bila sira kanw minnu dira sigida ɲɛmɔgɔw fɛ ka di sigidamɔgɔw ma dilannikɛyɔrɔ kasara in kɔfɛ ?,"The correct answer is **D: A y’aw yɛrɛ minɛ ka bɔ robinɛw ji mini ma** (It is the result of the reaction of the neutrons with the uranium).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a chain reaction:** It explains how neutrons released from uranium fission (splitting) cause more uranium atoms to fission, releasing even more neutrons. This is the basis of a nuclear reaction.
* **The question asks what the neutrons do:** The question specifically asks *what* the neutrons *do* after being released.
* **Option D directly addresses this:**  It states that the neutrons react with uranium, leading to more fission. This is the core mechanism of a sustained nuclear reaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ye jɛ sosumananw kɔ** (It is the result of the power of the sun): This is irrelevant; the passage is about nuclear fission, not solar energy.
* **B: A ye to sokɔnɔ** (It is the result of a fire):  Fire is a chemical reaction, not a nuclear reaction.
* **C: A y'aw kɔlɔsi sisi jɛman in samani ma** (It is the result of the great power of the people): This is a metaphorical and nonsensical answer in the context of a scientific explanation.



Therefore, **D** is the only answer that accurately describes the role of the neutrons in the described nuclear chain reaction.

This translates to ""Therefore, XDR-TB cases are extremely serious; there are 6,000 people and 330,000 people affected annually in Africa.""
* Dr. Moll's opinion (hakilina) is that the number of people affected annually is high.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Banasugu kura in sɔrɔli dɔgɔtɔrɔso la** - While doctors are involved, the text doesn't say doctors *caused* the problem.
* **B: Furaw sebaliya ka banasugu kura in kɛlɛ joona** - The text doesn't mention the furaw (religious leader) causing the problem.
* **D: A ka fagata ka ca** -  This means ""It is caused by something,"" but the text doesn't specify *what* caused the problem. It only highlights the high number of affected people.



"
Banabatɔ joli ye banasugu kura in sɔrɔ minnu sɛbɛntiyala furakɛlikɛlaw fɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: 15**.

The text states: ""San kelen kɔnɔna na, banabaatɔ kelen be se ka banakisɛ in yɛlɛma a masurunna mɔgɔ 10 k'a se 15 ma."" which translates to ""According to the report, the prevalence of the disease among children is between 10 and 15.""

This translates roughly to: ""...NextGen communication uses a network that includes satellite communication and terrestrial communication. It uses a combination of ground stations and air-based communication to support voice and data communications.""

While terrestrial communication is mentioned, the core of the NextGen system's communication is its reliance on satellites for a large portion of its functionality and reach. The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **B: Sanfɛ dɔnni sɛlɛn** (Cellular communication):  The text doesn't indicate that the NextGen system primarily relies on cellular networks.
*   **C: Dɔnni min be duguma radariw kun kan** (System using radar): While radar might be used for air traffic control within the system, it's not the main communication infrastructure.
*   **D: Dɔnni min be funteni bɔ kun kan** (System using fiber optics): Fiber optics are part of the terrestrial network but not the primary communication method.

The question asks what NextGen is focused on. The provided text states: ""NextGen boloda ye FAA bɛ ka min laɲini kun bɛ na pankuru pansira surunɲa ani taji digan caama nɔkɔya san o san ani ka fuɲɛjugubɔ lajɔ."" This translates to: ""NextGen is a FAA initiative focused on modernizing air traffic control systems and improving air navigation safety and efficiency.""

Option A, ""Pan sira surunmanw"" which translates to ""modernizing air traffic control systems,"" directly reflects this focus. The other options don't accurately represent the information provided in the text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛ sira ye, kokɔrɔ dɔnbagaw ma FBI jalaki ka’a da u ka sinsin nin k'an?","The correct answer is **A: Ka u ka ɲɛsɔrɔ hakɛ caya (Because it was a suspected drug smuggling)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the FBI investigated the suitcase because it was found with ""sinsin kow kan minnu ɲɛnɛbɔli ka nɔgɔ"" - which translates to ""white powder that smells like drugs"".  This strongly indicates the suspicion of drug smuggling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka nafolo don kojugu ɲɛnabɔta dumanw dafɛ (Because it was followed by a series of drug arrests)**: While arrests *may* have happened, the initial reason for the FBI's interest was the suspicious substance.  The text doesn't directly link the arrests to the suitcase itself.
* **C: Sinsin belebele jaajugufilɛ koɲɛw kan (Because the white powder was an unusual substance)**: The unusual nature is a *contributing* factor, but the core reason is the suspected drug smell.
* **D: Mɔbili taalenw koɲɛw (Because of the mobile phone contents)**: The text mentions the mobile phone was examined, but the *initial* trigger for the investigation was the suspicious powder.

Hakilina ka ɲɛsin fɛn nɔgɔlenw ma ye FBI diyagoya ka mun kɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Nafolo caman do mɔbili taalenw koɲɛw dafɛ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tariku dɔnbagaw ye FBI taabolo kɔrɔw lagosi ka da kan u ye sɔrɔdaw sinsin kow kan minnu ɲɛnɛbɔli ka nɔgɔ, kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnenyala mɔbili suyɛnni ni ɲaniya ye ka cakɛda in ɲɛtaa hakɛ caya."" This translates to: ""On the date of the event, the FBI table was filled with white dust, which had been a crime scene and a mobile phone with a certain type of lock had been taken and the key had been found.""

The question asks what the FBI investigated regarding the missing mobile phone.  The text directly states they investigated the **mobile phone's data**. Option A, ""Nafolo caman do mɔbili taalenw koɲɛw dafɛ"" translates to ""Following the data of the mobile phone."" This is the most logical investigation to follow after finding the phone and its lock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Cakɛda ɲɛsɔrɔli hakɛ la caya** (Recovering the key of the lock) - While finding the key is mentioned, the focus of the investigation seems to be on the phone's data.
* **C: I sinsin kojuguw k'an minnuw be sen ka ɲɛnabɔ nɔgɔyala** (The type of lock used was of a certain pattern and related to the crime) - The text doesn't specify the lock's pattern or its direct relation to the crime beyond it being on the phone.
* **D: Baarakɛlaw kɛrɛnkɛrɛn jaajugufilɛ koɲɛw ma** (Searching for the perpetrators of this crime) - While the FBI might eventually search for perpetrators, the immediate investigation focuses on the phone's data.



"
Mun sera taafagalaw ka bolifɛn min naana JAS 39C Gripen bin yɔrɔ la? ,"The correct answer is **A: A binna** (It happened).

The text states: ""Pankunru Gripen JAS 39C binna pankunru jigi kɛnɛ dɔ kan sɔkɔma nɛkɛ kan ɲɛ 9:30 (0230 UTC) ni ka mɛnɛ..."" which translates to ""The Gripen JAS 39C crashed at 9:30 (0230 UTC)...""  Therefore, the crash *did* happen.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: A ya yɛlɛma** (It was a dream) - The text describes a real event.
*   **C: A fodora** (It was a rumor) - The text reports a confirmed event.
*   **D: A taji banna** (It was a joke) - The text describes a serious incident.



"
"Ka tugun JAS 39C Gripen bin nin na, pankurun jigin yɔrɔ kun tugunna mun ɲɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Sigida Kunnafonidilaw (Squadron Leaders)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yen kunafoni dilaw y' a lase ko pankunruw sow tasuma fagamobili dɔ binna u tasuma fagatɔ.""  This translates to: ""Their phone calls were made by the Squadron Leaders to the command center regarding the operation's progress.""

Therefore, the Squadron Leaders were the ones making the calls regarding the JAS 39C Gripen's flight.
"
Brzezinski ye kunkelenna di jɔni ma faarisiw ka Erewolison waati kɔnɔ?,"The answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states: ""San 1976 San 1976 kalataw waatiw la, a be Carter bilasira jamana kɔkan politiki tabolow kan..."" which translates to ""In 1976, Carter appointed Henry Kissinger as his chief foreign policy advisor...""

Therefore, Brzezinski worked for Carter.
"
Jɔni ye jamana lakana ladilikɛla jɔyɔrɔ fa fo ka se 1977 ma?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states: ""San 1976 kalataw waatiw la, a be Carter bilasira jamana kɔkan politiki tabolow kan, ani ka laban ka kɛ jamana lakana bilasirali jɔyɔrɔ kƐ ((JLB) ka bɔ san 1977 ka ta san 1981, **Henry Kissinger kɔfɛ**.""  This directly indicates that Henry Kissinger was the American national security advisor (and therefore a key political figure) from 1977 to 1981.
"
Nunun na jɔni ma Bobek ka baara ladege tigitigi Partizan Belgrade kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: A ye celu yaara siɲɛ 468 kan ka’a to a ka ekipu la** (He played a total of 468 games for the club).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""A ye waati min kɛ ni jɛkulu in na, a ye bii 403 do bɔli 468 kɔnɔ.""  This translates to ""He played a total of 403 and scored 468 goals.""  The question asks *how* Bobek became a legend for Partizan, and playing a significant number of games and scoring a lot of goals is a major factor in achieving that status.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A ye celu yaara ka tɛmɛ a tolan tanna tɔɲɔgɔn bɛɛ kan** (He was famous for his speed and dribbling skills). While Bobek might have had those skills, the passage doesn't highlight them as *the* reason for his legendary status.
* **C: A delila ka sugandi ka kɛ tolan tannaw ka sodanso ye siɲɛ kelen a ka ekipu tariku la** (His legendary status is due to his unique role as a player who shaped the history of the club).  The passage doesn't directly state his unique role in shaping the club's history.
* **D: A ye cɛbɔya kɛ tolan na ka tɛmɛ a tolantan ɲɔgɔn bɛɛ ye** (He was famous for his scoring ability and many goals).  While scoring goals is important, the passage emphasizes the total number of games played *and* goals scored, making option A a more complete and accurate answer.



"
Dantigɛli jumɛn tɛ tiɲɛ ye Bobek ka tariku kan ka’a to Partizan Belgrade la?,"The correct answer is **A: A ye tolantan daminɛ Partizan Belgrade ye 1945** (It is from the time when Partizan Belgrade was founded in 1945).

The text explicitly states: ""A farala u kan san 1945 ni ka to yen fo san 1958."" which translates to ""He played until 1945 or until 1958."" Since the question asks about his connection to Partizan Belgrade, and 1945 is listed as the starting point, it's the most accurate answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A ye tolan tan Zagreb ye ka kɔn Partizan Belgrade ye** (He was a player from Zagreb who joined Partizan Belgrade): While he *did* play for Zagreb initially, the question is about his connection to Partizan.
* **C: A ye tolan tan Partizan ye fo 1995** (He was a player for Partizan from 1995): The text mentions a significant event in Partizan's history in 1995, but it doesn't say Bobek started playing for them then.
* **D: A ye tɔgɔ sɔrɔ n’a ka sodansoya sugandili la** (He was a supporter from the time of the war and a significant figure): The text indicates he was a player, not just a supporter.

"Ka kɛɲɛn nin tɛmɛ ye, jogo jumɛn be Hesperonychus nin Velociraptor bɔ ɲɔgɔnna?","The correct answer is **B: Sen sɔnin belebeleba filanan b’a la** (They share some similarities in their skeletal structure).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Hesperonychus Elizabethae ye Dromeosauridae du suguya dɔ ye w'a ye Velociraptor duden dɔ ye Danaya tun be a kan ko ni kɔnɔfugan ni fan-bɛɛ si ni joli kalama kɔnɔ in taamana sen fila kan a sɔniw kan inafɔ Velociraptor."" This translates to: ""Hesperonychus Elizabethae is a Dromeosaurid of the same genus as Velociraptor, and it is a small dinosaur with feathers or beautiful plumage that resembles the skeleton and structure of a Velociraptor.""

* The key phrase is ""in taamana sen fila kan a sɔniw kan inafɔ Velociraptor"" (it resembles the skeleton and structure of a Velociraptor).

* Therefore, the similarity lies in their skeletal structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sen fila b’a la** (They have the same skeletal structure) - This is too strong. The text says it *resembles* the structure, not that it's exactly the same.
* **C: Si b’a fari fan bɛ datugu len** (If they had a common ancestor, they would be similar) - While possible, the text doesn't explicitly mention a common ancestor. It focuses on the resemblance of their skeletons.
* **D: A fari ka kalan waati bɛ** (They are related by a distant line) -  The text states they are in the same genus, implying a closer relationship than ""distant line.""

Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the text.
"
Hesperonychus kɔrɔ samanna ka bɔ dafɛn jumɛn farikolo cogoya la?,"The correct answer is **A: Sen sɔnin(w)**.

Here's the breakdown:

* **Q: Hesperonychus kɔrɔ samanna ka bɔ dafɛn jumɛn farikolo cogoya la?** translates to: ""What kind of animals did Hesperonychus eat?""
* **P:** Describes Hesperonychus as a small dromaeosaurid, similar to Velociraptor, but with a more feathered appearance and smaller size. It also mentions that it might have been an ancestor of Velociraptor.
* **""Sen sɔnin(w)""** translates to ""Small animals"" or ""Small prey"". This aligns with Hesperonychus being a smaller predator.
* **""Sima fariw""** means ""Big animals"". This is unlikely, as Hesperonychus was small.
* **""Senw""** is not a recognized word or phrase in the given context.
* **""Dakala""** means ""Big"" or ""Great"". Also unlikely.

Therefore, based on the description in P and the question in Q, the most logical answer is **Sen sɔnin(w)**.
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn ye tiɲɛ ye muguci kun kan?,"The correct answer is **C: U fila ye furu siri Buffalo san kelen ka kɔn**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Furudenw nunuw furula Tɛkizasi ni y'a san kelen ye wa u taara Bifalo k'u yɛrɛ ɲanajɛ ni teriw ani somɔgɔw ye."" This translates to: ""The buffalo herds came from Texas and crossed the river when they were fleeing from hunters and warriors.""
* **Option C directly reflects this:** ""U fila ye furu siri Buffalo san kelen ka kɔn"" translates to ""They came from Buffalo's side crossing the river."" This accurately summarizes the movement of the buffalo herds as described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cɛ nin muso fila bɛ kun be bɔ Texas** (They are all the animals that came from Texas) - This is too broad. The passage specifically mentions the buffalo.
* **B: Kasaarabatɔ duuru de kun be ye** (They are all the animals that are...) - This is incomplete and doesn't accurately reflect the passage.
* **D: Muguci kɛra Buffalo** (Buffalo near Buffalo) - This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage, which describes a migration.



"
Dantigɛli jumɛn ye tiɲɛ ye lajɛrɛ kun kan muguci kɛra min kɛnɛ kan?,"The correct answer is **C: A kɛra ɲɛnajɛ dɔ senfɛ Texas**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Furudenw nunuw furula Tɛkizasi ni y'a san kelen ye wa u taara Bifalo k'u yɛrɛ ɲanajɛ ni teriw ani somɔgɔw ye."" which translates to ""The buffalo came from Texas and were hunted for meat, hides, and other things.""

The question asks where the buffalo came from. The text directly answers this by saying they came from Texas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A kɛra Buffalo sanfɛkalanso dɔ ka ɲɛnajɛ senfɛ:** This translates to ""It comes from Buffalo, the place where the buffalo are hunted."" While Buffalo is related, the text specifies the origin is Texas, not just Buffalo.
*   **B: A kɛra sanyɛlɛmaseli lajɛrɛ senfɛ min labɛnna sariya kɔnɔ:** This translates to ""It comes from the buffalo hunting grounds where they are slaughtered."" This is not the origin of the buffalo.
*   **D: A kɛra furuɲɔgɔnma dɔw furu senfɛ:** This translates to ""It comes from the hunting grounds of the buffalo.""  Similar to B, this refers to hunting grounds, not the origin itself.

This translates to: ""After 100 small-scale plots are cultivated, the remaining land is used to provide food for the women and children in the community.""
* **The question asks:** ""What is the purpose of the land that is left over after cultivating 100 small-scale plots, according to Luno?""
* **Option A:** ""Nɔgɔdonnan kurun donin ko dɛsɛ"" translates to ""The remaining land for food."" This directly reflects the passage's description of the remaining land being used for food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jikuruw nin fiɲɛ baw** translates to ""The women and children are growing."" The passage doesn't say they are *growing* anything, just that they *receive food*.
* **C: Taji bɔn** translates to ""Good land."" While the land might be good, the passage specifies its *purpose* – for food.
* **D: Joginnin bɛ sen len baarakɛlaw ma** translates to ""The land is being used for livestock."" The passage doesn't mention livestock.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the amount of water that Luno's well can hold, according to the text?""
* **The text states:** ""Mɛtɛrɛ 100 kɔkɔjikuru in tun be sira la ka taa ka nɔgɔtakurunni ta inafɔ kɔrɔlen o la ɲɛmɔgɔw siranna fɔlɔfɔlɔla ko kurunni in be se ka donni in bɔn."" This translates to ""A well with a diameter of 100 cubits is dug and is able to provide water to the people during the dry season.""  This directly tells us the well has a diameter of 100 cubits. While the *volume* isn't explicitly stated, the question is about the well's capacity, and the diameter is a key factor in determining capacity.
* **Option B** mentions the diameter (100 cubits) which is related to the well's capacity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tiyɛnli kɛra ka kɔn donin ta ɲɛ:** This translates to ""The well is able to provide water during the dry season."" While true, it doesn't give us the *amount* of water the well can hold.
* **C: Baarakɛla tannifila cɛla, kelen de jogin da sɔrɔ:** This translates to ""The people are digging a well, the earth is soft and easy to dig."" This is about the digging process, not the well's capacity.
* **D: Kurun ɲɔninna ka ta’a dankanda la:** This translates to ""The well water is very clean."" This is about the quality of the water, not the quantity it can hold.

The text states: ""San 1960w la a seginna ka taa Alizeri yɛrɛmahɔrɔnyalen kura la ka mɔgɔw kalan filimun turunè la."" which translates to ""In 1960, he began to travel to Algeria to film documentaries.""  This indicates that he started traveling to Algeria in 1960. The question asks when he began filming documentaries about Algeria.
"
Jabaraninw ma sigi yɔrɔ jumɛnw sudo lajɛrɛ senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Rome dugu kɔnɔna fan bɛ** (Rome is the center).

The text states: ""Jabara belebele caama tun sigira yɔrɔ caama na Rome walasa mɔgɔw ka se ka janaja in lajɛ Italy dugu caama wɛrɛw la ani duniya fan tɔw la..."" 

This translates to: ""Many people came to Rome to attend the funeral, which was held in the center of Italy and attracted people from all over the world...""

Therefore, the core message is that Rome was the central location for the funeral.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Litaliyen jamana duguba caman kɔnɔ** (The Italian government's center): While Italy was involved, the text focuses on Rome as the physical location.
*   **C: Yɔrɔ dɔw la Poland jamana kɔnɔ** (The Polish government's center): This is irrelevant to the question. The text mentions Polish officials attending, but not their government's location.
*   **D: Saint Peter ka fɛrɛkɛnɛ kɔnɔ** (St. Peter's Basilica's location): While the funeral *took place* in St. Peter's Square, the question asks where people *came* to. The text emphasizes Rome as the destination.



"
Sudonni lajɛrɛ kɛra min?,"The correct answer is **D: Rome dugu kɔnɔ fɔlɔ, kɔfɛ Itali jamana duguba wɛrɛ la**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the funeral was held in St. Peter's Square in Rome, and that the event drew people from all over Italy and the world, especially Poland and countries with large Polish communities.
* Option D accurately reflects this information: ""Rome was the host, and it was the capital of Italy.""
* Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they don't accurately describe the main location or context of the funeral.



"
"Ka tugun mugu fodonna, jɔni furakɛra jɔginda sɛbɛ sababu la?","The correct answer is **D: Kɛrɛfɛmɔgɔ dɔ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gaziko cakƐda ɲƐmɔgɔ dɔ taara a yɔrɔw la kƐrƐfƐmɔgɔ dɔ ka weleli kɔfƐ gazi bɔli kola."" This translates to: ""The reason is that the evil spirits have made the wicked to work for the evil ones.""

The text then explains that these evil spirits are causing problems, and a large number of people (100,000) are working for them.  Therefore, the cause of the problems is the **evil spirits (kɛrɛfɛmɔgɔ dɔ)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A dɔgɔman ye mɔgɔ duuru ye** (The cause is a strongman/powerful person): While a powerful person *could* be involved, the text directly attributes the cause to the evil spirits.
* **B: Mɔgɔ si** (People are angry):  The text describes *actions* driven by the evil spirits, not simply anger.
* **C: Taji cakɛda faama dɔ** (It's a result of a bad fate):  The text implies a *deliberate* manipulation by evil spirits, not just bad luck.



"

The text states: ""Gaziko cakƐda ɲƐmɔgɔ dɔ taara a yɔrɔw la kƐrƐfƐmɔgɔ dɔ ka weleli kɔfƐ gazi bɔli kola."" This translates to ""The kingdom had counselors who worked to help the king.""

The question asks who John was. The answer directly follows that he was one of those counselors.  The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ joli fatura ni ataki in na?","The question asks for the number of people who received tetanus shots.

Therefore, the answer is 4 (Schneider + his colleagues + his team).

Looking at the options:

* A: 4
* B: 2
* C: 5
* D: 2

The correct answer is **A: 4**.
"

This translates to: ""He [Schneider] was informed that he had to get a tetanus shot. Moreover, his vaccination card was missing and he and his fellow cadets had to get a tetanus shot.""  This clearly indicates that Schneider was the one informed about needing the tetanus shot.

This translates to: ""Taekwondo, Karate and wrestling were included in the 2005 Olympics."" Therefore, wrestling is the correct answer.
"
Arthur Guinness tun ye bolonɔ da singa St James Gate Brewery na ni y’a san joli ye?,"The correct answer is **C: 1759**.

The question asks when Arthur Guinness established the brewery. The text states: ""Arthur Guinness ye bolonɔ da singa san 9000 St James Gate Brewery Dublin Irland jamanan ye. **San 1759** Arthur Guinness ye bolonɔ da singa san..."" which translates to ""Arthur Guinness established the 9000 St James Gate Brewery in Dublin, Ireland in the year **1759**.""
"

The passage states: ""San 250 kɔfɛ, Guinness ye sɔrɔcakɛ yiriwa min be munumun Euro wari kasabi miliyari 10 (America jamanan Wari dollari 14) san o san."" This translates to: ""After 250 years, Guinness is a major exporter with a turnover of 10 billion Euros (American dollars 14 billion).""

Therefore, Guinness's turnover is stated to be **14 billion dollars**.
"

The text states: ""Faransi de jamana wolonwula nan ye Uniyɔn ErɔpƐƐnni la ka sƐgƐn baanakisƐ in kɔsɔn...""  This translates to ""France and the European Union together are taking measures to prevent the spread...""

Therefore, ""wolonwula"" (together) is the correct answer.
"
H5N1 baanakisɛ tun sɛbɛnciyala yɔrɔ laban jumɛn na?,"The correct answer is **A: Faransi**.

The text states: ""Faransi de jamana wolonwula nan ye Uniyɔn ErɔpƐƐnni la ka sƐgƐn baanakisƐ in kɔsɔn..."" which translates to ""France was the first country to be affected..."".

The text states: ""Haiti dĩonete mathĩna makonainiĩ na mũrimũ ũcio kuuma mĩaka ya 1800s."" which translates to ""Haiti has suffered from this kind of disaster since the 1800s.""

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Baanakisɛ siɲɛn laban kɛra Haiti waati jumɛn san’a ka jɛsɛn kɛlɛbanikɛlaw fɛ?"" (How many times has Haiti suffered from such disasters?) is ""San 1800 waatiw"" (Since the 1800s).

* **The text states:** ""Taka taka kuuma kambĩ ya UN diarĩ therie wega, igatũma dwari ciingĩre rũĩini rwa Artibonite, rumwe wa njũĩ iria nene mũno Haiti."" This translates to: ""A significant amount of UN aid from Nepal went to the Artibonite region, one of the most populous areas in Haiti.""
* **The text also mentions:** ""Mbere ya gũkinya kwa mbirarũ, Haiti dĩonete mathĩna makonainiĩ na mũrimũ ũcio kuuma mĩaka ya 1800s.""  This refers to the aid from Nepal in response to the 2010 earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Artibonite Kɔɔ in:** This is just the name of the region, not where the aid *went*.
* **B: UN dagayɔrɔ:** This translates to ""The UN is doing."" It doesn't specify *where* the UN aid went.
* **D: Haiti Sariya ani Demokaraci Kalanyɔrɔ:** This translates to ""Haiti Society and Democracy Organization."" While mentioned as a recipient of lessons learned, it doesn't specify where the Nepal aid *physically* went.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that directly answers the question about where the UN aid from Nepal went.



"
Irilandi marabaaw be ka mun labɛn ka kɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Sariya nɔgɔmanw ta dɔrɔkuw yamaruyali kan**.

Here's why:

The text describes Irilandi Marabaaw's actions:  ""Irilandi marabaaw be k'u sinsin Wasabulon sariyasen teliman in kan ka ko in latilen."" This translates roughly to ""Irilandi Marabaaw has been busy organizing Wasabulon for five days, focusing on organizing things.""

Then, the text states, ""A nafa ka bon sisan foroba kɛnɛya ni sariya tileni hakilina na ko sariyalabɛnni ka waleya joona.""  This suggests that Irilandi Marabaaw is responsible for coordinating various tasks.

Finally, the passage concludes, ""Marabaw ka laselikɛla dɔ y'o fɔ.. Kɛnɛya Minisiri y'a ka jɔrɔ yira fura tabaaw ka kuntaala surun hɛɛrɛ yamaruyali ni furata dannaya dilen kabini ni waati sariyatan yɛlɛmaw waleyala."" This means that the Minister has praised Marabaaw for successfully managing the various tasks (amaruyali) and coordinating with different departments.

Therefore, the question ""Irilandi marabaaw be ka mun labɛn ka kɛ?"" asks what Marabaaw is responsible for. The text indicates that Marabaaw is responsible for coordinating *various tasks (sariya nɔgɔmanw ta dɔrɔkuw yamaruyali kan)*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka nimero di dɔrɔku afari kɛlaw ma:**  This translates to ""The number of very few things."" The text doesn't suggest Marabaaw is dealing with only a few things.
* **B: Ka sariya gɛlɛw ta dɔrɔkuw yamaruyali kan:** This translates to ""The kind of tasks and very few things."" The text doesn't suggest Marabaaw is dealing with only a few things.
* **D: Ka dɔrɔkuw yamarubaliya yɛlɛma:** This translates to ""The coordinating tasks of high-level officials."" While Marabaaw is coordinating, the text doesn't indicate that it's specifically for high-level officials.



"
Mun tun yamaruyali do Irilandi waati ni kɔnɔ?,"The answer is **A: Sonyali**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Mun tun yamaruyali do Irilandi waati ni kɔnɔ?"" which translates to ""What kind of people are the inhabitants of Ireland?"".  The provided text says ""Marabaw ka laselikɛla dɔ y'o fɔ.."" which translates to ""Marabaw proudly stated that they are Sonyali.""

Therefore, the correct answer is Sonyali.
"
Dankarilikɛla jumɛn de ko be ka ɲɛɲini n’a ye damatɛmɛ wale?,"The correct answer is **B: Nɔnabila tiɲɛnni**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what *type* of thing the ""dankarilikɛla"" (which we can translate as ""complaint"" or ""report"") is about.
* The text states: ""ko ɲɛɲini bɛ ka kɛ cɛw dankarilikɛla mi tun ye damatɛmɛ wale kɛ ni o ni sekonidonko mafiyɛɲani tɛ kelen ye.""  This translates to ""that the complaint I filed is about someone who is involved in a criminal group.""
* The phrase ""damatɛmɛ wale kɛ ni o ni sekonidonko mafiyɛɲani tɛ kelen ye"" directly describes the nature of the complaint – it's about involvement with a criminal group (mafiyɛɲani).
* ""Nɔnabila tiɲɛnni"" translates to ""criminal activity"" or ""criminal behavior"" which aligns with the meaning of being involved in a criminal group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dankarilikɛli** (Complaint): This is just the noun itself and doesn't describe what it's *about*.
* **C: Mafiyɛɲani** (Criminal group): While relevant, the question asks about the *type* of thing the complaint is about, and ""criminal activity"" is a broader description.
* **D: Son** (Son): This has no connection to the text.



"
"Nɔnabila yɛlɛma waati, dankarilikɛla tun ye mun kɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Ka ɲɛkɛn ni bɛn tamasiɲɛ ye**

Here's why:

The question asks ""What is the cause of the police officer's frustration?"".  The text states: ""Nɔnabila tun ma tiɲɛn; yɛlɛma tun kɛla ka finifin ɲɛkɛn ni bɛn ni dusukun tamasiɲɛw ye ka yɛlɛma fitini kɛ """"o"""" la ka a kɛ """"e"""" ye.""  This translates to: ""The officer is not happy; they are frustrated because they have to correct people who say 'o' instead of 'e'.""

Therefore, the cause of the officer's frustration is *people incorrectly using ""o"" instead of ""e""* (which is a phonetic error in the language being spoken). Option B accurately captures this meaning: ""Because of the people who use incorrect sounds.""



Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A siginindenw kelen yɛlɛmali (Because of the weather):** The text doesn't mention weather.
*   **C: Nɔnabila tiɲɛnna (The officer is angry):** While the officer is frustrated, the text specifies the *cause* of the frustration, not just the emotion itself.
*   **D: Ka fini ta k’o yɛlɛma (Because of the officer's sound):** The frustration isn't about the officer's *own* sound, but about the errors of *others*.

Therefore, the key element added was the construction of gas stations.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn tun ma minnɛ Rolando Mendoza fɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Polisiw (Police officer)**.

The text states: ""Rolando Mendoza arathũkirie mũcinga wake wa M16 erekeirie atarii acio."" This translates to ""Rolando Mendoza pointed his M16 rifle at those people."" This action, along with the context of the incident, strongly suggests he is a police officer.  The text also says he was arrested (""Mendoza nĩarathirwo agĩkua""), which is consistent with police involvement.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ minɛnnenw jumɛn ka bilali ma fɔ jona?","The question is in a different language (likely Swahili or a related language) and asks ""What is the name of the woman who gave birth to a child after a long time?"".

The correct answer is **A: Turisiw**.  This is likely a misspelling of ""Turisimu"" which means ""Tourism"" in Swahili.  The question seems to be a riddle or word puzzle, and ""Tourism"" is a playful connection to the story – the ""long time"" the woman was waiting might be linked to the long journey tourists take to a place.

The other options are unlikely to be relevant:

* **B: Mɔgɔ kɔrɔbaw** -  This doesn't seem to be a recognized word or concept.
* **C: Jatalaw** -  Also not a recognized word.
* **D: Deminsenniw** - Not a recognized word.



Therefore, despite the bizarre connection, **A: Turisiw** is the most plausible (though riddle-like) answer given the context of the question.  It's important to note that the connection is highly abstract.

The text states: ""Mɔgɔmurutilew jigi be ka bɔlɔlɔ kan sɛbɛn miliyon 1.2 fara ɲɔgɔn kan ka ɲɛsin Jamana Wasabulo ma Nowanburukalo la.""  This translates to ""Citizens have been found to have received 1.2 billion reais in bribes from the Brazilian government.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Roberto Jefferson** is mentioned as someone who allegedly gave bribes, but the question asks *who* received the bribes, not who gave them.
* **C: Roman Catholic Batokɛso** refers to Catholic priests and isn't mentioned in relation to the bribery.
* **D: Marta Suplicy** is mentioned as a politician, but not in connection to the bribery.



"
Mɔgɔmurutilew bin’u ka dɛmɛ di joni ma?,"The correct answer is **A: Roman Catholic Batokɛso**.

The text states: ""Mɔgɔmurutilew jigi be ka bɔlɔlɔ kan sɛbɛn miliyon 1.2 fara ɲɔgɔn kan ka ɲɛsin Jamana Wasabulo ma Nowanburukalo la. **Roman Catholic Batokɛso** y'a balan gɔrɔjinɛni ni gini furu la jamana in kɔnɔ Bresile Jamana Wasablon ye kuma falenfalen kɛ sariya taliko la san 10, wa ni ɲɔgɔnna kɛnɛkan furuw yamaruyalen do Rio Grande do Sul dɔrɔn.""

This translates to: ""The majority of people voted for the Brazilian President in the last 10 years, and the religious group that has been a majority in Brazil since the beginning of the Brazilian Republic is the **Roman Catholic population** of Rio Grande do Sul.""

Therefore, the majority of people voted for the president are Roman Catholic.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...sanbɛlɛni ye binni daminɛ..."" which translates to ""...textile industry was his business...""
* **The question asks:** What was Armand Versace's profession?
* **Option A directly answers this.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jirali tun bɛ ka taa sanga duuru kɔfɛ** (His company used to do a lot of foreign trade) - The passage doesn't mention foreign trade.
* **C: Fiɲɛbaw tun bɛ** (It was the textile industry) - While technically true, the question asks about *Armand Versace*, not the industry itself.
* **D: Duden dɔ nɔn tununa a la** (The news was not good for him) - The passage doesn't give any indication that the news was bad.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately reflects the information provided in the passage."
"Versace fɛ, fiɲɛba baw daminɛna waati jumɛn?","The correct answer is **A: Sanga duuru kɔfɛ jirali daminɛnen**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...fiɲɛ dɔ ye cili daminɛ, sanga kelen o kɔ, fiɲɛ ye kilomɛtɛrɛ 70 sɔrɔ waati kelen kɔnɔ...."" This translates to ""...the road is very long, the car went, the road is 70 kilometers and it went...""
* Then it continues describing the journey and the reason for traveling.
* Armand then says, ""Versace fɛ, fiɲɛba baw daminɛna waati jumɛn?"" which translates to ""Armand said, 'Versace, how long is the road?'""
* The answer to this question, based on the passage, is ""Sanga duuru kɔfɛ jirali daminɛnen,"" which translates to ""The road is very long.""

The other options are not supported by the text:

* **B: Sanji kɔfɛ** - This translates to ""The car is old"" and is not mentioned.
* **C: A balimamuso tununen kɔfɛ a la** - This is nonsensical and not found in the passage.
* **D: Ka kɔn sanbɛlɛnin ɲɛ** - This translates to ""It went to the village"" and is not the answer to the question about the road's length.

"Ka kɔn Fred ɲɛ, fiyɛnkoloba joli de ɲɔgɔn tun ma kɛ 35°W kɔrɔn fɛ?","The question asks how many miles Fred is from the 35°W meridian.

We are given:
* Fred is 105 miles east of the 35°W meridian.

Therefore, Fred is 105 miles from the 35°W meridian.

The correct answer is **B: Saba** because in the provided options, ""Saba"" translates to ""Seven"" in some contexts, but the question refers to the distance, which is 105 miles, meaning the options must be a unit of distance. Considering this, there seems to be an error in the provided options. The distance is 105 miles, which is equivalent to 105 * 1.60934 kilometers = 169.18 kilometers.

However, if we assume there's a typo and ""Saba"" is meant to represent the number of miles, then the answer would be 105. Since that isn't an option, let's re-examine the question and the units.

The question asks ""how many miles Fred is from the 35°W meridian?"". Fred is 105 miles *east* of the 35°W meridian.  So, the distance is 105 miles.

Looking at the options:
A: Fosi - means ""First""
B: Saba - means ""Seven""
C: Fila - means ""Four""
D: Kelen - means ""Ten""

None of these represent 105 miles.  There's likely an error in the question or the provided answers.

However, if we consider the possibility that the question intended to ask *how many degrees west* Fred is from the 35°W meridian, the answer would be 105 miles / (1.60934 km/mile) / (35° longitude per degree) = approximately 105/563.37 = 0.186 degrees west. This isn't among the options.

Let's consider the meridian. Fred is *east* of the meridian. The question should ask how many miles east. The correct answer would be 105 miles. Since none of the answers match 105 miles, there must be an error.

Let's consider a different interpretation of the question. If ""Saba"" represents a distance of miles, then the answer is 105 miles. However, 105 miles isn't in the options. Let's examine the context of the question. It says ""Fred is 105 miles east of the 35°W meridian."" So the distance is 105 miles. None of the options represent this.

There seems to be an error in the question or the provided options. If we were forced to choose the closest option to 105, it would be ""Kelen"" which means 10. But that doesn't make sense in the context.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{Kelen}$"
"Ka Fred to Cape Verde jamana kɛrɛfɛ, a tun kundalen do fan jumɛn kan?","The correct answer is **A: Tilebin**.

Here's why:

* The question asks how Fred traveled to Cape Verde.
* The text states that Fred traveled using a **satellite-based navigation system** (kɔkɔjida fiyɛnkoloba saaban min lakodonnen do kɔrɔn fƐ ni 35°W hakƐ). This system relies on **tiles** (tilebin) to pinpoint location and guide the journey.
* The other options don't fit the context:
    * **Kɔkɔdugu** (dog) is irrelevant.
    * **Kɔrɔnfɛ** (cloud) is irrelevant.
    * **Worodugutilebin** (world map) is a general tool, but the passage specifies a satellite-based system using tiles.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **Tilebin**."
Nin jumɛn de ka telin ka tɛmɛ a fɔra minnu kɔ kan?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The text states that 802.11n is an improvement over older standards like 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g, and can achieve speeds up to 600Mbit/s. The question asks which standard allows for such speeds, and the text explicitly identifies 802.11n as the one capable of that.
"
Mun de kan ka kɛ walasa 802.11 waati tɛmɛlenw kɛɲɛni 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Arajo fila (Infrastructure)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nɔremu 802.11n be barakƐ fiɲƐsira 2,4 Ghz ni 5 Ghz kan."" This means 802.11n operates on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies. It can work with older standards like 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g, which are part of an infrastructure.
* **The question asks:** How does 802.11n's wireless speed compare to 802.11b?
* **The passage provides:** ""Teliya 802.11n hakƐ ka telin kɔsɔbƐ dɔnni ka tƐmƐ minw kɔnna a ɲƐ ni 600Mbit/s teliya hakƐ ye.""  This indicates 802.11n can achieve speeds up to 600 Mbps, which is *significantly* faster than 802.11b.  The speed improvement is due to the infrastructure being able to support faster data transfer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Teliya kosɛbɛ (Wireless router):** While a wireless router *facilitates* the connection, it doesn't explain *how* 802.11n's speed surpasses 802.11b.
* **B: 802.11b fanga walasa ka baara kɛ ni 5.0Ghz (802.11b only operates on 5.0 GHz):** 802.11b operates on 2.4 GHz, not 5.0 GHz.  This is factually incorrect.
* **C: 600Mbit/s teliya hakɛ ye (600 Mbps speed):**  The 600 Mbps speed is a *result* of the infrastructure's capability to handle faster data transfer, not the direct comparison *how* the speed improvement works.

Therefore, **D: Arajo fila (Infrastructure)** is the most accurate answer because it recognizes that 802.11n's speed improvement is linked to the broader infrastructure's capability."
Ko joli de Olympic sanujɔnjɔntabaa tun b'u nɔ Angilɛfɔjamanaw ka Tulonkɛw la?,"The correct answer is **C: Fila**.

Here's why:

The question describes a scenario where athletes in the 100m and 200m races are trying to beat the record held by a British champion. The phrase ""bawo jɛn kɛlen tɛ n'u ye tulonw na"" asks how they can achieve this.  ""Fila"" means ""to beat"" or ""to surpass.""

The question asks *how* the athletes can beat the British champion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duuru** means ""to be enough"" or ""to suffice."" This doesn't make sense in the context of trying to beat a record.
*   **B: Saba** means ""seven."" It's a number and doesn't relate to the question.
*   **D: Naani** means ""no"" or ""not."" This contradicts the idea of trying to beat a record.



"
Munna Olympic sanujɔnjɔntabaa tun tɛ fura ta u ka dimi na?,"The correct answer is **D: A tun ma yamaruya Angilɛfɔjamanaw ka Tulonkɛw**

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* the Olympic runners are so fast.** The passage states they are fast *because* they train with the ""Angilɛfɔjamanaw ka Tulonkɛw"" (elite/world-class athletes).
* **Option A** is too general and doesn't explain *why* the runners are fast.
* **Option B** suggests they are simply born fast, which isn't the main point the passage is making.
* **Option C** describes a training method, not the reason for their speed.

Therefore, the passage implies that the runners are fast *because* they train *with* elite athletes, making **D** the accurate answer."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tun bɛ se ka nani ɲakamin ye dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ kan?","The correct answer is **B: Rapɔri ka bɔ Icelandic Meteorological Biro** (Report from the Icelandic Meteorological Office).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Wabici ya Icelandic Meteorological onayo dĩarutĩte riboti cia gũtuthũka gwa kĩrĩma..."" which translates to ""The scientists of the Icelandic Meteorological Office have issued a report on the eruption of the volcano...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kabanɔgɔ fiimanw bɔli** (Some kind of story): This is too vague and not supported by the text.
* **C: Jɛn dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ kariti** (Some kind of map): While a map might show the location of the volcano, the text focuses on the report detailing the eruption.
* **D: Kɔw ɲɛfɔlen minnu kɛra Isiland fan wɛrɛw fɛ** (Some kind of fallen star in Iceland): This is completely unrelated to the text, which discusses a volcanic eruption.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jumɛn ɲɛ yɛlɛmani daminnɛ na?","The question asks: ""When did the German team win the championship?""

The text describes volcanic activity in Iceland. **This question is completely unrelated to the text provided.**

However, looking at the answer options, the correct answer would be **C: Marisikalo tile 10** because that translates to ""March 10th"" in Swahili, and that's the only option that indicates a date. It's highly probable that the question intends to ask about a sports event that happened on March 10th.

**Therefore, assuming the question intends to ask about a sports championship, C is the most logical answer.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kalobolisira min ye ciden fili, mɔgɔw tun bɛ a kɔnɔ"" which translates to ""The orbit is a free orbit, it was created by the moon's gravity"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Minnɛ ɲanamaw tun bɛ ciden na** - This translates to ""The moon's gravity created the orbit."" While true, the passage explicitly states *how* the orbit is maintained - through the free orbit itself. This option doesn't address the core of the question.
* **C: Ciden filili kɛra kunnawolo ye** - This translates to ""The orbit is a simple circular one."" The passage doesn't specify the shape of the orbit.
* **D: Ciden kɛrɛw pɛntirilen do** - This translates to ""The orbit is very small."" The passage states the orbit is 1,500 kilometers, which is a significant distance.

Therefore, option A directly answers the question about what *created* the orbit, according to the passage.

This means Chandrayaan-1's orbit had a difference in altitude (height) of 1.5 kilometers (approximately 3000 Watts of energy), and this was due to the difference in gravitational forces.

* **Option A directly reflects this explanation.** The difference in gravitational forces is the *reason* for the difference in altitude in the orbit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A ka filili cuni kɛra ka ɲɛ** (It is due to the Earth's rotation).  While Earth's rotation *influences* orbits, the text explicitly points to *gravitational forces* as the cause of the altitude difference.
* **C: A tun filila ni kalobolisira mɔgɔ man ye** (It is due to the use of powerful rockets). The text doesn't mention the use of powerful rockets as the cause of the altitude difference.
* **D: A tun bɛka fɛn nafama fila ta** (It is due to the firing of a thruster).  The text doesn't specify the firing of a thruster as the reason.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately answers the question based on the information provided in the text.

The text states: ""Baana nin bɛ lɛw dɛ la, min tilala tuguni ka yɛlɛma mɔgɔw la sosow fɛ.""  This translates to: ""Children do listen to it, and they are kept awake by the stories of the ancestors."" Therefore, children are kept awake by the stories of the ancestors (sosow).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bagajiw** (Stories) - While related, the text doesn't say children *are* stories. They are *kept awake by the stories*.
*   **C: Lɛw** (Listen) - This describes an action, not what children are kept awake by.

The question asks: ""What is the source of the data that is used to make the table?""

The text explicitly says the data comes from ""gɔrijigɛni ni gin jɛw balili"" which translates to ""population in the period of..."". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: HJR-3 sɛgɛsɛgɛli jonajona:** This refers to the specific data categories within HJR-3, not the overall source of the data.
* **B: Hakɛ kura ka ɲɛsin gɔrijigɛni ni gin jɛ ma:** This means ""the data that is collected from the population"". It's close, but ""gɔrijigɛni ni gin jɛw balili"" is more precise.
* **C: Wasabulon sesiyɔn tɛliman:** This refers to the population census results, which is *a* possible source, but the text is more specific about the time period covered by the data.

* The text explicitly states that the Panama Papers are about the ""panamaka Mossack Fonseca ka soronnadonnaw ka cakƐda sƐbƐnw min be surunɲa miliyon tan"" (Panama's Mossack Fonseca law firm's documents revealing millions of transactions).  
* The text further mentions that the documents revealed ""sariya nɔminƐli bara caman tun kundora ani islandi ni paskistan fila bƐƐ jamana ɲƐmɔgɔw demisiyɔnnera"" (political figures like Iceland and Pakistan were also implicated).

* **A: Bankibolofaracanmaw ka kiliyanwaritikiw** (British banks): While British banks *might* have been involved, the primary focus of the Panama Papers is on Panama and its law firm.
* **C: Olandi Banki** (Dutch Bank): The text doesn't mention the Dutch bank.
* **D: Pakisitan jamana ɲɛmɔgɔw** (Pakistani political figures): While Pakistani figures were mentioned as being implicated, the broader context is about the Panama Papers and their revelations about tax evasion linked to Panama.

Ni pankuru kasara jumɛn de kɛra kasara bɛɛ juguman ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Pankuru kasara a ka sira kan ka bɔ Iran ka taa Ameriki.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Salo Iran ka pankurun kasaraw bɛɛ la juguman kɛra kabini san caman tuma minna taama pankurunni dɔ kun dalen Arameni kan binna k'a kunna mɔgɔ 168 faga. Kalo tɛmɛnen in na taama pankurun wɛrɛ ye sira bila ka gosi koko dɔ kun, ka mɔgɔ tanniwolonwula faga.""

This translates to: ""The history of Iranian diplomacy includes a significant presence of Armenian diplomats who served in Iran for about 168 years.  During this time, they played a crucial role in fostering relations between Iran and the United States.""

Therefore, option C accurately reflects this information. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** Mentions the US sending diplomats *to* Iran, not the diplomats being *in* Iran.
*   **B:** Is too vague.
*   **D:** Mashhad is a city in Iran, but the question asks about the diplomats' overall presence, not a specific location.



"
Ni jumɛn tɛ seka kɛ kun ye sanfɛsira kasara caman min bɛ kɛ Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Ɲangini minnu bɛ pankurukura san bali** (Christian minorities were persecuted in Iran).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ka kon nin dɔgɔkun in ɲƐ, lakanabaw ka pankurunni kasara ye mɔgɔ saaba faaaga ka saba wɛrɛw bana. Salo Iran ka pankurun kasaraw bɛɛ la juguman kɛra kabini san caman tuma minna taama pankurunni dɔ kun dalen Arameni kan binna k'a kunna mɔgɔ 168 faga.

This translates to: ""Because of this, the minorities of the country were subjected to severe restrictions, especially the Christians, who numbered 168 thousand.  Over time, the Christians were persecuted and killed in large numbers.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Siviliw ni finitikiw ka pankurukalan kɔrɔ** (Civil and political minorities were persecuted) - While potentially true in a broader sense, the text focuses specifically on the persecution of Christians.
* **B: Musaga dɛsɛ walasa ka pankuru kuraw san** (The followers of other religions were persecuted) - While other religions *may* have faced restrictions, the text details the persecution of Christians.
* **D: Pankurukalan fanga dɔgɔyali** (Persecution of religious minorities) - This is too general. The text specifically mentions and provides numbers for the persecution of Christians.



"
Nin fɛnw jumɛn kelen tun tɛ Iraki Kalan Jɛkulu ka gafe kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Mara tabolo lagosili**.

The text states: ""Gafe in be dayɛlɛ ni sankɔrɔta ye k'a ɲinsin foroba baro ma ani fɔkabɛn Lameriki jamann kɔnɔ minnu be talikɛ mara taabolow la Azi bangu kɔrɔfɛ jamanaw la."" This translates to: ""The incident was caused by a protest led by supporters of the American administration and representatives of the American administration in Asia.""  The word ""lagosili"" means ""led by"" or ""initiated by"". Therefore, ""Mara tabolo lagosili"" (led by a protest) is the most accurate summary of what caused the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lase dɔ min b’a fɔ ko yɛlɛma dɔw be se ka binkanni cayali bali Iraki kɔnɔ** (The reason is the desire of the people to escape the oppression of the Iraqi government): While people may have desired to escape, the text doesn't directly state this as the *cause* of the incident.
* **C: Laɲiniw walasa ka Iraki jamana dancɛw lakana** (The actions of the Iraqi government): The text describes the incident as a *reaction* to the government's actions, not the cause itself.
* **D: Sankɔrɔta dɔ ka ɲɛsin Lamerikɛn jamana ka fɔkabɛn ma** (The protest led by American supporters): While American supporters were involved, the text emphasizes that the *protest* itself was the initiating factor, led by various supporters.



"
Lraki Kalan Jɛkulu ma nin fɛnw juman kelen laɲini?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka jamanaw ni ɲɔgɔncɛ hakilina kura dɔ ta**.

The text states: ""A ka laɲini 78 cɛla fɔlɔ ye ka jamanaw ni ɲɔgɔcɛ hakilina kura dɔ ka kan ka ta yani ni san in ka ban walasa ka Iraki jamana dancɛw lakana ka bɔ ladorokoli juguw la walasa ka lasigidenyjuruw lakuray'a na dafɛ jamanaw ni ɲɔgɔcɛ.""  This translates to: ""And 78 days later, the Iraqi people, who were oppressed, were able to take to the streets to protest and demand the resignation of the Iraqi government and the arrest of those responsible for the killing of the oppressed people.""

Therefore, the Iraqi people protested for the **resignation of the Iraqi government and the arrest of those responsible for the killing of the oppressed people.** Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko sɛnbɛntiya ka kɛ ka fo ko Iraki binkanni cayali ka lajɔ** (The military was able to free the Iraqi people): While the military was involved, the text emphasizes the Iraqi *people* taking to the streets to protest.
*   **B: Tasira yɛlɛmali jona-jona** (Continuous strikes): The text doesn't mention continuous strikes.
*   **C: Foroba baro kɛli** (A protest by the unemployed): The text focuses on the oppressed people, not specifically the unemployed.

"Lakanatigilamaw ka fɔ la, jɔni tun jatelen do nafɔ Provenzano demɛ bolo dɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Giovanni Falcone**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tun marala Provenzano fɛ tuma minn'a ye dan siri Rinna ka kɛlɛ kolokolonen la ka ɲɛ sin jamana in ma min ye Mafia kɛlɛkɛdenw Giovanni Falcone ni Paolo Borsellino dajili laɲini san 1992.""  This translates to: ""...was killed by Provenzano, and this happened in the same year as the assassinations of Mafia magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.""

Therefore, Giovanni Falcone is the one mentioned as being killed alongside Paolo Borsellino.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ kunafoni fun ye, mun kɛra Falcone ka saya sababu ye?","The correct answer is **A: A fagara Riina ka kɛlɛ kolokolen sen fɛ**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""...Ni fama nunu tun marala Provenzano fɛ tuma minn'a ye dan siri Rinna ka kɛlɛ kolokolonen la ka ɲɛ sin jamana in ma min ye Mafia kɛlɛkɛdenw Giovanni Falcone ni Paolo Borsellino dajili laɲini san 1992.""

This translates to: ""...And the powerful Provenzano, who was the leader of the clan that was responsible for the killings that marked the time, who were the Mafia agents Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino killed in 1992.""

Therefore, the text directly links Falcone and Borsellino's killings to the clan led by Riina (Provenzano).  Option A accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A fagara lakanatigilamaw fɛ (He fought against the clans.)** While Falcone fought against the Mafia clans, the text specifically mentions Riina's clan as being responsible for his death.
* **C: Picolo bilara ka faga (Picolo was responsible.)** Picolo is mentioned as a figure within the Mafia, but the text focuses on Riina's clan and the direct responsibility for Falcone and Borsellino's deaths.
* **D: A fakara a yɛrɛ ɲɔgɔn mafaala jugu Paolo Borsellino fɛ (He was responsible for Paolo Borsellino's death.)** The text states Falcone and Borsellino were killed *together* by Riina's clan, not that Falcone was responsible for Borsellino's death.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka fara Olɛnpik ni diyɛn ŋana dɔ kan, Saito tun ye Zapɔn ka waatiw bɛɛ Zido Kalankɛ Kulu ɲɛmɔgɔ ye a sa waati."" This translates to ""Since the Olympics began, Saito has been Japan's leading Judo champion.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Diɲɛ ŋana siɲɛ fila** (A simple player) - While he is a player, the text highlights his significance as a champion.
* **C: Olɛnpiki sanu jɔjɔn fila tabaa** (Olympic games a top player) - This is true, but not the *most* accurate or complete answer based on the text.  The text emphasizes his role as *Japan's* leading champion.
* **D: Zido dɔnbagaŋana** (Judo expert) -  He's an expert, but the text emphasizes his status as a *champion*.



"
Iwasaki sera ka yɛrɛ tila furula saratikandili yɔrɔ juman?,"The correct answer is **C: Ɛndi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...wulufaatɔ dɔ dara a kan Tibet, a yƐrƐɲinnibatɔ bolila ka bɔ furu dɔ la Nepali, wa u ye a minƐ Ɛndi.""  This translates to ""...the people of Tibet, whose ancestors were descendants of a princess who married a Nepali, and who live in India.""

The question asks where Iwasaki's ancestors originally came from (where they lived before coming to Nepal and India). The text indicates they lived in **Ɛndi** (India). Therefore, Iwasaki's ancestors were originally from India.



"
Jɔni dara Iwasaki kan?,"The correct answer is **B: Piratiw**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Piratiw ye a suɲɛ, wulufaatɔ dɔ dara a kan Tibet, a yƐrƐɲinnibatɔ bolila ka bɔ furu dɔ la Nepali, wa u ye a minƐ Ɛndi."" This translates to: ""Piratiw is a type of [something - the text is incomplete but implies a type of person/being], the Tibetan people... [do something] and have a lot of fur like the Nepali, and it is [something else - also incomplete].""
* **The question asks:** ""Jɔni dara Iwasaki kan?"" which means ""What is Iwasaki like?""
* **The answer states:** ""Min tun be na kɛ a furumuso ye,"" meaning ""I haven't seen its fur."" This directly refers back to the description of Piratiw in the first sentence.

Therefore, the answer is that Iwasaki is a **Piratiw**. The other options don't relate to the information provided."
Alonso ka ɲɔgɔndan labanna waati juman?,"The correct answer is **C: Schumacher kɛlen kɔ ka senbɔ ɲɔgɔndan na** (Schumacher was able to overtake the car).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Michael Schumacher tilala aka ɲɔgɔndan na sɔɔni Alonso kɔfɛ, k'a sabu kɛ mɔbili jɔlan ciyɛnni ye kɛlɛ caman senfɛ ɲɔgɔndan in na.""  This translates to ""Michael Schumacher drove to overtake Alonso's car, because his car was faster than Alonso's.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alonso ka ɲɔgɔndan labanna waati juman?** (How many times did Alonso overtake?) The passage doesn't give this information.
* **B: Fisichella ka mɔbili tilala a la** (Fisichella drove the car). This information is not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Sani a ka kɛ ɲɛfɛ** (Sani was fast).  There is no mention of someone named Sani.



"
Mun kɛra sababu ye Schumacher y’a senbɔ ɲɔgɔndan jona?,"The correct answer is **D: Mɔbili jɔlan tiɲɛni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher tilala aka ɲɔgɔndan na sɔɔni Alonso kɔfɛ, k'a sabu kɛ mɔbili jɔlan ciyɛnni ye kɛlɛ caman senfɛ ɲɔgɔndan in na.""  This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher overtook Alonso because his car was faster than Alonso's.""

Option D, ""Mɔbili jɔlan tiɲɛni"" (The car was faster), directly reflects this reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A mɔbili tilala a la (His car was a machine):** While true, this isn't the *reason* for the overtake. It's a general statement.
* **B: Ani Alonso ka ɲɔgɔn susu dɔ (Alonso was driving poorly):** The text doesn't imply Alonso was driving poorly. It focuses on the car's performance.
* **C: Fisichella kɛra wɛsɛwɛsɛ min tiɲɛni sabu ye (Fisichella's car was faster):** The text is about Schumacher overtaking Alonso, not Fisichella.

This translates to: ""When the hours of the young people are over, Glynn Computer Center is used to take the names of the young people who have been waiting for 24 hours and they are given food and drink and they are given a place to sleep in the Glynn Computer Center...""

Therefore, Glynn Computer Center (Kiiritigɛla Glynn) is the place where the young people are taken.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni waati kunkuruni minɛli yamaruya ye mun kofɔlen be tɛmɛsiran in kɔnɔ, minɛlenw yamaruyalen be ka mun sɔrɔ walasa u ka se ka datugun nɛgɛ kaɲɛ 24 tɛmɛnen kɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Kɛnɛkan ɲangiliw sɛbɛndiyalen Kiiritigɛla Glynn fɛ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...w'a be ɲaginliw sɛbɛntiya minɛlikɛla ɲɛmɔgɔ fɛ. **Ɲangiliw be don jamana ka ɔridinatɛrɛ ɲɛsiraw fɛ, min b'a to kiri in be se ka sirabɔ. Lamɛli in be siganamɔgɔ in ka hakɛ don tamaseren ka kiiri lateliya. **""

This directly translates to: ""...they have a customer service department. **They have a computer system that allows them to search. The system allows customers to book appointments.**""

Therefore, the system used by the customer service department (specifically, the computer system operated by customer service representatives) is what allows customers to book appointments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Musaga (Musaga)** - This means ""easily"" or ""simply."" The passage describes a process, not an easy one.
*   **B: Minɛli ɲɛmɔgɔ kumaɲɔgɔnyali (Customer service representatives)** - While customer service representatives *use* the system, the question asks about the system itself.
*   **D: Lamɛli (The system)** - The system *allows* the appointments to be booked. It's the *customer service department* that operates the system and facilitates the booking.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kun jumɛn kelen de ma ta ka kɛ walawali ye kalafili takofilanan dabilalila?","The correct answer is **D: Siriyakolo dibidibifɛn (Syrian refugees)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Lasigidenw y'a fɔ k'u tun ye dibidibifɛn jɔnjɔn sɔrɔ Afuganisitan siriyakolo la walasa ka kalafili takofilana in kɛ manamana ye."" This translates to: ""Many of them are Syrian refugees who are also refugees from Afghanistan.""

* **The question asks:** ""What is the reason for the increase in Syrian refugees?""

* **The text implies (though doesn't explicitly state the *reason* for the increase),** that the influx of Syrian refugees is linked to the Afghan refugees seeking refuge. This is a common pattern where conflict and instability in one region lead to refugees seeking safety in another.  Therefore, Syrian refugees are a significant part of the overall refugee population in Afghanistan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lakanabaliya faratiw (Pakistani refugees):** While there are Pakistani refugees, the text focuses specifically on the *increase* in refugees and links it directly to the Syrian refugees alongside the Afghan ones.
* **B: Sariyakolo sɔsɔli (Afghan tribal leaders):** This is irrelevant to the question about the increase in *refugees*.
* **C: Musakabaw (Negotiators):** This refers to people involved in negotiations and not to refugee populations.



Therefore, **D: Siriyakolo dibidibifɛn (Syrian refugees)** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the given text. It's not a direct answer to the *reason* for the increase, but it identifies a key component of the refugee population being discussed."
Munna kalafili takofilanan tun laban kɛra manamana ye lasigidenw fɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Siriyakolo in tun dibidibifɛn ne do**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lasigidenw y'a fɔ k'u tun ye dibidibifɛn jɔnjɔn sɔrɔ Afuganisitan siriyakolo la walasa ka kalafili takofilana in kɛ manamana ye.""

This translates to: ""The leaders have been repeatedly urging the Afghan government to release the hostages.""

Therefore, the leaders have repeatedly urged the government to release the hostages. This implies the government has been hesitant to release the hostages and hasn't acted on the pleas to do so. The phrase ""dibidibifɛn"" means repeatedly or continuously. So, the most accurate answer is that the Afghan government has been delaying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A tun taara siriyakolo in juguya la (They have been waiting for the terrorists to act).** The passage doesn't say they were waiting for terrorists to act. It states the leaders were urging the government to release hostages.
*   **B: Lakanabaliya faratiw tun bɛ yen (The foreign ones have been helping).** The passage doesn't mention foreign help.
*   **D: Kalafili musaka tun ka kojugu (The terrorists have started to act).** The passage doesn't say the terrorists have started to act. It's about the leaders urging the government to release hostages.



"
Jɔnni bɛ kirikow sigi senkan FATA ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Pankisitan marabulon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pakistan jamanakuntigi ye """"Politikimɔgɔw"""" ta ka FATA kow ɲɛnabɔ, min ka mara bɛ yɔrɔw tilan bɛɛ kan."" This translates to: ""Pakistan's government is the ""Politikimɔgɔw"" that was entrusted with FATA's administration, which was previously under British control.""

The question asks *who* was entrusted with FATA's administration. The passage explicitly says **Pakistan's government** (""Pakistan jamanakuntigi"" - Pakistan's government) was entrusted with it. ""Marabulon"" means government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Politikimɔgɔw** - ""Politikimɔgɔw"" refers to the government/administration itself, not the entity that *received* the responsibility.
*   **C: Pakisitan jamanakuntigi** - This means Pakistan's government, but it's a bit redundant. Option A is more precise.
*   **D: Grande Bretagne marabulon** - This refers to the British government, which is stated as having *previously* controlled FATA, but not currently administering it.

Therefore, the best and most accurate answer is **A: Pankisitan marabulon**.



"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn tɛ tiɲɛ ye FATA “Politikimɔgɔw” kan?,"The correct answer is **A: U bɛ kirikow sigi senkan**.

Here's why:

Translation: ""Pakistan's administration was in FATA, which was a tribal area, which was prone to rebellions. Its administration was due to the failure of managing the tribes, which was stipulated in Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution.""

The key phrase is ""marabulon ni kiri sigi senkan min latikɛra"" which translates to ""failure of managing the tribes"".  This means the administration was a result of *tribal rebellions* or *tribal unrest*.  The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
Emma Stone tun sugandira jɔnjɔn jumɛn na?,"The correct answer is **C: Filimu Bɔlamusoma bɛɛ la Ɲuman** (Movie drama bɛɛ la Ɲuman).

* **The provided text states:** ""Filimu kɔrɔ dongili filaw, LamƐl¡ (Fatɔw minw be sugo) ani Dolow ka dugu, sugandira ka kɛ dongiliw bɛƐ la ɲuman danma ye."" (The films ""La La Land"" (the musical with love) and ""The Notebook"", starring Emma Stone, have been highly praised.)
* **The question asks:** ""Emma Stone tun sugandira jɔnjɔn jumɛn na?"" (Has Emma Stone starred in many movies?)
* **The text directly links Emma Stone to ""La La Land"" and ""The Notebook"" as highly praised films.**  Therefore, the best option reflecting this information is that she has starred in movie dramas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Filimu bɔlamusoma Dɛmɛbaga bɛɛ la Ɲuman** (Movie drama has been highly praised): This is too general and doesn't specifically mention Emma Stone.
* **B: Filimuɲama bɛɛ la Ɲuman** (Movies have been highly praised): This is also too general and doesn't focus on Emma Stone's specific involvement.
* **D: Filimu dilancogo bɛɛ la Ɲuman** (Action movies have been highly praised): The text doesn't mention action movies.



"
Jɔnjɔn jumɛn tun ye filimu ye na tun ma sugandi?,"The correct answer is **D: Dongili bɛɛ la Ɲuman Danma** (The movie is a drama).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sugantili dɔ ninnu be taali kɛ filimu, filimuɲama, sinenmantogarafi, donfiniw, filimu dilancogo, fɔlikan danma, dilanni hakilina, mankan sigicogoɲɔgɔnkan, kƐnƐlabarali danma boli bƐƐ la ɲuman."" This translates to ""The genre of the film covers cinema, filmmaking, cinematography, editing, action films, comedy, romantic films, thrillers, horror films, and drama.""

Later, it mentions ""Filimu kɔrɔ dongili filaw, LamƐl¡ (Fatɔw minw be sugo) ani Dolow ka dugu, sugandira ka kɛ dongiliw bɛƐ la ɲuman danma ye."" which translates to ""The films are epic, Lamela (a story of love) and Dolow ka dugu, which are a combination of drama.""

Therefore, the most accurate option is D, as it identifies the film as a drama (Ɲuman Danma).
"
Ninnu jumɛn de tora baara la dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ kɔfɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Pankurunjigikɛnɛ min bɛ Ishikawa**.

The passage states: ""Sira dɔw halakira, nɛgɛsiracakɛda y'a ka baara jɔ sigidakofɔniw na ani pankurunjigikɛnɛ Noto min bɛ Ishikawa mara la datuguni tora.""  This translates to: ""Subsequently, the power was transferred to the Noto peninsular area of Ishikawa Prefecture.""  Therefore, the power was rerouted to the Noto peninsular area.

Option B directly reflects this information. The other options are incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate that the power was rerouted to the Hokuriku Shika power grid (A), the Noto power grid in Ishikawa (the rerouting location - B), or to Niigata (D).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de tora halaki kɔfɛ ka sabu kɛ dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Sira dɔw**.

* **The passage states:** ""Sira dɔw halakira, nɛgɛsiracakɛda y'a ka baara jɔ sigidakofɔniw na ani pankurunjigikɛnɛ Noto min bɛ Ishikawa mara la datuguni tora.""
* **Translation:** ""The damage caused by the earthquake has led to a power outage affecting the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture.""

The question asks what the power outage is affecting.  The passage explicitly states that the outage is affecting the Noto Peninsula. Therefore, the answer is ""Sira dɔw"" (the Noto Peninsula).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Du dɔw (The cause):** While the earthquake is *the cause* of the power outage, the question asks *what* the power outage is affecting, not *why* it happened.
* **B: Yeelenjibarakalamaw fila Shika yeelendibon la (The Shika Power Station):** The Shika Power Station was affected, but the power outage is broader than just that station.  The passage mentions a larger area.
* **D: Noto Pankurunjigikɛnɛ (Noto Peninsula):**  This is the correct answer, but it's phrased as ""Sira dɔw"" in the passage.  ""Sira dɔw"" means ""the Noto Peninsula"" in this context.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko kuma wɛrɛw sera Isirayɛli jamana ka siniɲɛsigin ma min ka gɛlɛn jamana fila nunuw ma..."" which translates to ""And so the Israeli occupation has been ongoing for many years...""
* **The question asks:** ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu ko jumɛn kuma ma fɔ sɛbɛn in kɔnɔ?"" which translates to ""What is the reason for the conflict that has been ongoing for so long?""
* **The passage provides context:** The passage describes the conflict starting with the 1967 war and the subsequent Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: San 1967 kɛlɛ kun (Since 1967):** While the conflict *began* in 1967, the *ongoing reason* for the conflict is the continuing occupation.
* **C: Kɛlɛbolo kɛli kulufurancɛ (The blockade of Gaza):** The blockade of Gaza is a *part* of the conflict, but not the fundamental, long-term *reason* for it.
* **D: Fɔnkɔɲɔgɔn yali dancɛw la (The ongoing territorial disputes):** While territorial disputes are a part of the conflict, the *occupation* is the overarching reason that fuels those disputes.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories since 1967.** It mentions the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
* **The question asks about the extent of the Palestinian territories currently under occupation.**
* **Option D directly reflects the passage's statement that the Israeli occupation covers the West Bank and Gaza Strip.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dancɛw sinsin li fɔlɔ sani kɛlɛ cɛ** - This translates to ""The current territories are not completely free."" While true, it's not the *extent* of the occupation.
* **B: Kɛlɛbolo kɛlila Zɔrɔdani Kulufurancɛ** - This translates to ""Territories of the Jordanian West Bank."" While the West Bank *was* under Jordanian control before 1967, the passage focuses on the *Israeli* occupation.
* **C: Jabiw ka ɲɛsin Isirayɛli jamana ka siniɲɛsigin ma** - This translates to ""The territories that have been under Israeli occupation since the establishment of the Israeli state."" While factually correct in a broader sense, it doesn't specify the *current* extent of the occupation as described in the passage.

The text states: ""ɲɔgɔnye dɔ tun kɛra Marisikalo tile 20 East Bay Law Community Center la so ŋanamulen tigiw kan..."" which translates to ""The meeting took place at 20 East Bay Law Community Center..."".  This directly answers the question of where Carolyn Wilson was seen to be actively involved.

"Ni ɲɔgɔndan naani min bɛ na kɛ siɲɛn wɛrɛ, jɔnni de bɛ mɔbilibolilaw ka ɲɔgɔndandangele jɔyɔrɔ naani na?","The correct answer is **A: Hamlin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hamlin ye kuru mugan jɛn kɔfɛ, nka duuru b'a bolo ka tɛmɛ Bowyer la."" This translates to ""Hamlin was the fastest in practice, and his time was faster than Bowyer's.""

The question asks who was the fastest in practice.  Hamlin is identified as the fastest.
"
"Ɲogɔndan min kofɔlen do tɛmɛsira in nan, Kahne ka kuru ye joli ye ni Mɔbilibolilaw ka Ɲɔgɔndandangele na?","The correct answer is **B: 2250**.

Here's why:

The question asks for the number of laps completed by K'a Keselowski. The first sentence states: ""K'a to ɲogɔndan na Keselowski ye mɔbilibolilaw ka ɲɔgɔndandangele ye ni kuru 2,250 ye.""  This directly translates to ""K'a Keselowski completed 2,250 laps.""

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nɛgɛkuru kodɔnlen 24,000 minnu binna dugukolo kan, 34 dɔrɔn sɛgɛsɛgɛra ka kɛ Marisi minɛlakikaw ye.""  This translates to ""In the period of 24,000 days, 34 dark-skinned people who were immigrants to Mars were born."" 

Therefore, the people born were both tan-skinned and dark-skinned immigrants.
"
"Inafɔ a fɔlendo ni tɛmɛsira in na, mun de ye tiɲɛ fara ninnu na minnu sɛgɛsɛgɛra ka kɛ marisi minɛlakikaw ye?","The correct answer is **A: U bɛɛ tun sɔrɔ la ka bɔ nɛgɛ sanji jigilenw la Zuwe kalo kɔnɔ** (He had to buy the gold with precious stones from the Jew's money).

Here's why:

* The question asks *why* the gold was bought with precious stones.
* The text explicitly states: ""Fara ninnu cɛman, tanniduuru dɔrɔn lakodɔnna ka bɔ nɛgɛ sanji jigilenw la Zuwe kalo tɛmɛnnen in."" (He had to buy the gold with precious stones from the Jew's money).
* Option A directly reflects this reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U ɲɔgɔnna 24,000** (He had 24,000 of them) - This refers to the quantity of gold, not the reason for the exchange.
* **C: U sɔngɔ bɛ $11,000 bɛ min ka ca ni sanusɔngɔ ye** (He spent $11,000 on... ) - This refers to a separate transaction of selling gold for money, not the reason for the initial exchange.
* **D: U ɲɔgɔnna 34** (He had 34 of them) - This refers to the number of precious stones, not the reason for the exchange.

The passage states: ""Schumacher min be baarasɛgɛlafiyɛnbɔ la kabini san 2006..."" which translates to ""Schumacher retired from racing in 2006...""
"
Waati jumɛn Massa tun bana na?,"The correct answer is **D: Sani san 2009 waati tɔ cɛ**.

The text states: ""Massa tun ka kan ka Formula 1 ɲɔgɔndan jɔnjɔn ta siɲɛn wolowila, tun ka kan ka Sani Schumacher banabakatɔ nɔnabila Berezili ka in degunna kɔsɛbɛ kunkolo bana fɛ kasara dɔ la san 2009 Hɔngiri Jɔnjɔn Ba la. Massa kakan k'a sen bɔ san 2009 wati tɔ la a dɔgɔyalen.""

This translates to: ""Massa then became a Formula 1 driver, then became Michael Schumacher's teammate Brazilian driver who was considered a promising talent until the 2009 British Grand Prix. Massa had his worst performance in 2009.""

Therefore, Massa had his worst performance *in 2009*.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ko in dilanni bina se ka fɛn kɛ AOL cokodi?","The correct answer is **C: AOL labaaralaw hakɛ bina fadenya Yahoo ni Microsoft labaaralaw hakɛ la**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ni ko in dilanni ye yɔrɔla, yɛrɛ mabila in ka kan ka ban.""  This translates to ""When the years passed, many companies were bought.""  And the passage mentions that Microsoft acquired AOL.
* **The question asks:**  ""What is the reason why AOL's stock price has fallen in recent years?"" The passage says AOL's stock price has fallen because of the competition from Yahoo and Microsoft.
* **Option C directly reflects this:** ""AOL's stock price has fallen due to the competition from Yahoo and Microsoft's stock prices.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL labaaralaw hakɛ bina seka caya (AOL's stock price is constantly rising).**  The passage clearly states the opposite – it's fallen.
* **B: AOL bina kɛ cakɛda kelen taalen ɲɛ n'a ka bɔlɔlɔkanfeere ye (AOL is a leader in the internet market).** While AOL *was* a leader in the past, the passage implies it's no longer, as its stock has fallen due to competition.
* **D: AOL tina labaara tun Etats Unis (AOL is only operating in the United States).** The passage indicates AOL operated in the US, but doesn't specify it's *only* there.  The core issue isn't its geographical location, but competitive pressures.



"
Ninnu jumɛn de tun laban bi se ka na ni dilanni kura ye?,"The correct answer is **C: AOL ka yɛrɛ mabila ka taa ɲɛ feere la a yɛrɛ tɔgɔla**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ni ko in dilanni ye yɔrɔla, yɛrɛ mabila in ka kan ka ban."" This translates to ""And over time, the players in the market have been eliminated.""
* It then mentions AOL's decline: ""AOL sera ka bɔ ka taa ɲɛ n'a ka bɔlɔlɔkanfeere ye a yɛrɛ tɔgɔla,"" meaning ""AOL was once a major player in the internet market that was once dominant.""
* The other options are less directly linked to the idea of players being eliminated:
    * **A:** While the internet's growth is relevant context, it doesn't explain *why* AOL declined.
    * **B:**  The decline of internet portals is *part* of the story, but not the specific reason for AOL's elimination.
    * **D:** Yahoo and Microsoft's actions *contributed* to the changing landscape, but aren't the primary reason for AOL's demise as described in the passage.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the passage's core message is that AOL, a once dominant force, has been eliminated from the market.
"
Mɔgɔ joli sara ni binkanni wale in na minnu tun tɛ polosiw?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The text states: ""Polosiw ye a jira ka fɔ ka olu sikalenbƐ Daesh (ISIL) ka kƐlƐcƐ dɔ la min nɔminƐlendo binkanni wale in na."" which translates to ""Police officers who were killed in the attack were 19.""
"
Jɔnni ye sikanna mɔgɔ minnu jira ni binkanni wale in na?,"The correct answer is **A: Polosiw (Police)**.

The text states: ""Polosiw ye a jira ka fɔ ka olu sikalenbƐ Daesh (ISIL) ka kƐlƐcƐ dɔ la min nɔminƐlendo binkanni wale in na."" which translates to ""The police are fighting to eradicate the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist organization and its members.""

Therefore, the question ""Jɔnni ye sikanna mɔgɔ minnu jira ni binkanni wale in na?"" (Who are the people fighting the members?) refers to the police.
"
"Ka da Florida jɔyɔrɔ ka I n'a fɔ sarabacɛjamana, mun de tun dira Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **D: Kɛmɛkɛmɛ sarada 46 kalatasɛbɛn**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Etats Unis jamanakuntigiso'kumalaserakɔrɔ Newt Gingrich ye jɔyɔrɔ filanan sɔrɔ ni 32 ye kɛmɛkɛmɛ sarada."" This translates to ""The Republican Party's presidential candidates, led by Newt Gingrich, had 32 delegates.""

The passage then says: ""I n'a fɔ sarabacɛjamana, Florida y'a ciden taniduuruw bɛɛ di Romney ma, min y'a dɛmɛ ka kɛ Republican Party ɲɛfɛ."" This means ""Because of this situation, Florida's primary favored Romney, who became the Republican nominee."" 

The question asks what happened to Mitt Romney *because* of the Florida primary. The passage explicitly states he won 46 delegates in that primary, which led to him becoming the nominee. Options A, B, and C are incorrect.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kɛmɛkɛmɛ sarada kalatasɛbɛn joli de tun sɔrɔ la Gingrich fɛ jamanakuntigikalatafɔlɔ la?","The correct answer is **C: Kɛmɛkɛmɛ sarada 46**.

The passage states: ""Etats Unis jamanakuntigiso'kumalaserakɔrɔ Newt Gingrich ye jɔyɔrɔ filanan sɔrɔ ni 32 ye kɛmɛkɛmɛ sarada.""  This means Newt Gingrich received 32 electoral votes.

It also states: ""Massachusetts maraɲɛmɔgɔ Mitt Romney ye Florida Republican Party jamanakuntigikalatafɔlɔ ta Tarata don ni kɛmɛkɛmɛ sarada 46 kalatasɛbɛn ye."" This means Mitt Romney received 46 electoral votes.

The question asks for the number of electoral votes received by Gingrich, which is stated as 32. Therefore option B is the correct answer.

**I apologize for the error in my previous response.** I misread the question and initially focused on Romney's score. The question specifically asks about Newt Gingrich's score.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔnni tun ma kalata ɲɔgɔndan kɛ tugun kalataɲɛnɛbɔbagaw ka jabi kɔfɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Gingrich ye Santorum fo, nka a ka kumakankolon sera Romney ma..."" This translates to ""Gingrich and Santorum are together, and he (Gingrich) is trying to catch up to Ron Romney...""  This indicates Gingrich is the one trying to gain ground.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔnni de tun kuma kɔsɔbɛ kalata cɛbɔ wɛrɛ ka kalataɲɛnɛbɔbagaw ka jabi kɔfɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Bachmann**.

The text states: ""Bachmann, min tun ye jɔnjɔn Ames Straw Poll sɔrɔ Uti kalo la, y'a ŋanuya ka yɛrɛkofɔ jɔ."" which translates to ""Bachmann, who was the runner-up in the Ames Straw Poll for the Republican nomination, had a good showing.""

The question asks who had a good showing in the Republican nomination. The text directly mentions Bachmann having a good showing. The other options are mentioned in the context of their strategies or comparisons, but not explicitly described as having a good showing.
"
Yɔrɔ jumɛn kelen de tun kɛnɛ tun dabɔra jabɔ yɔrɔ kama sani san 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Kumaso**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""San 2005 laban na, Toginet ye kumaso filana dɔ sigi n'o ye Astronet ye."" This translates to ""In 2005, Toginet became the facility that was also Astronet.""

The question asks about the facility used in 2015. While the text doesn't explicitly state what was used in 2015, it establishes that in 2005, Toginet was the facility. Since the question asks about a facility used *after* 2005 and it's asking about a facility *used* (not necessarily *became* a facility), the most logical conclusion, based on the provided text, is that Toginet Kumaso is the answer. Options B and C refer to specific locations or entities that are mentioned but not directly linked to the facility used in 2015. Option D is too vague.



"
Kumaso sira bi jabɔ ɲɛfɔ inafɔ ka dankari ya suguya jumɛn sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **B: Adamadenya la**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...min na na ni yokorofɔlisenkura ye min bɛ dankari kɛ adamadenya la!"" This translates to ""...we have been grateful to the people for their kindness!""  Therefore, ""adamadenya la"" (the people) are the ones who have been grateful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kanuban:** Kanuban refers to the type of medicine.
*   **C: Kalansokɔrɔ:** Kalansokɔrɔ refers to the people who do work.
*   **D: Sigida:** Sigida refers to the first person who is in charge.

"
David Headley tun ye mun de fara ɲɔgɔn ka min labanna ka kɛ dɛmɛn ye binkanniikɛla marifatigi kulu ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Kunnafoni**.

The text states: ""David Headley ka lakɔlɔsili ni kunnafoni faraɲɔgɔnkan tunye dɛmɛn..."" which translates to ""David Headley was a **phone operator** who was used to...""

Therefore, the answer is Kunnafoni (phone operator).
"

The text states: ""Nadal ye a kunfa ni kuru 88% macila ni sebaya kuru 76 sɔrɔli ye taako fɔlɔ la."" This translates to: ""Nadal has a serve percentage of 88% and a return percentage of 76%, and he played well."" The phrase ""sebaya kuru"" means ""return"" and ""Raonic ka"" means ""Raonic's"".  Therefore, Nadal returned better than Raonic.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔyɔrɔ jumɛn de tun bɛ Nadal ni Raonic ka maci la taako fɔlɔ kɔfɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal ye kuru 76 sɔrɔ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nadal ye a kunfa ni kuru 88% macila ni sebaya kuru 76 sɔrɔli ye taako fɔlɔ la."" This translates to ""Nadal has a first serve percentage of 88% and a return percentage of 76%.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic ye kuru 88% sɔrɔ:** This states Raonic's first serve percentage, not Nadal's.
*   **C: Ɲɔgonsɔrɔ jaate tun ye 7-2:** This is the score of the match, not information about the players' percentages.
*   **D: Raonic ye sebaya sɔrɔ Nadal ka:** This states Raonic is returning against Nadal, but the text states Nadal's return percentage.



"

The text states: ""Dunuyalaminijɛkɛlu bɛ ka ɛsipaɲɔli, Italiyɛn ani kɔreyɛn kanw lasankɔrɔta..."" This translates to ""The world's editors are from Spanish, Italian and Korean news...""

Therefore, Italian is one of the languages represented in Naked News's news sources.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, yɔrɔ jumɛn tɛna Naked News ka kunnafoni sɔrɔ?","The correct answer is **B: Ɛntɛrinɛti (Internet)**.

The text says Naked News broadcasts ""kan kunafonijɛnsɛn kama"" (broadcasts via online platforms). The internet is the platform that enables online broadcasting.

This translates to: ""The main group of volunteers has been working hard to help, and the total number of volunteers is 117 in Silalomi Ba who are involved in this work.""

Therefore, 117 is the correct number of volunteers in Silalomi Ba.
"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn bi ɲɔgɔdan ninnu Ɲɔgɔndan la jabi tigitigi jira?,"The correct answer is **B: Jikurubolikɛla 45 ma se ka boli kuncɛ ni Silalɔmiba in na.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Muso kulu jikurukan bolikɛla naani dɛsɛra ka u ka boliw kuncɛ, ani jikurubolikɛla 45 a kuuru 117 la Silalɔmi Ba in na bina jɔyɔrɔko la ni boli in na.""  This translates to: ""The large group of people who had been preaching the good news, and the group of 45 elders from the Silalomiba were present to encourage the brothers and the preaching work.""

Option B directly reflects this information. Options A, C, and D are not supported by the text.
"
NBA ya laɲinni ka ninnu jumɛn kelen basikɛtikɛnɛ jɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: Fɔlikɛra min COVID-19 baanakisɛ tun ye min minɛ**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the NBA postponed games because of COVID-19. 
* It then specifically mentions that the Utah Jazz had a COVID-19 outbreak. 
* The question asks *which* players have been affected. 
* Therefore, the answer must be the Utah Jazz players who tested positive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Basikɛti waati (Water basketball):** This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **B: Atah Jazz fɔlikɛra dɔ (Utah Jazz players):** While correct *that* they are affected, option C is more specific and directly answers the question of *which players*.
* **D: Atah Jazz basikɛti ekupu (Utah Jazz basketball team):**  This refers to the team as a whole, not the individual players impacted by the outbreak.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de nana ni jɔɔrɔ ye NBA la ka ɲɛsin baanakisɛ in ma?","The correct answer is **A: Baanakisɛ tun yera NBA mɔgɔw la** (The coronavirus is affecting NBA players).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""NBA hakilina bɔra Atah Jazz fɔlikɛra dɔ baanani na COVID-19 baanakisɛ tun ye min minɛ"" (The NBA has postponed the Utah Jazz game due to the spread of COVID-19). This directly implies that the COVID-19 outbreak is affecting *players* in the NBA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baanakisɛ tun yera basikɛti tana caman na Atah Jazz fɔlikɛ yɔrɔ la** (The coronavirus is affecting the basketball game of the Utah Jazz). While the game is affected, the core impact is on the *players* who play in the game.
* **C: Atah Jazz fɔlikɛra dɔ tun mase ka fɔlikɛ ka ɲɛn baanakisɛ yele kɔfɛ a la** (The Utah Jazz players have been forced to isolate). This is a possible consequence, but the passage doesn't explicitly state this.
* **D: Baanakisɛ tun yera Atah Jazz fɔlikɛra dɔ la** (The coronavirus is affecting the Utah Jazz players).  This is too specific. The passage refers to the *NBA* and the spread of the virus among its players, not just the Utah Jazz players.



"
Jɔnni ye sebayasɔrɔli bii do Washington faabaw ye balontanna ka ta Atlanta Thrashers juguyara?,"The correct answer is **D: Alex Ovechkin**. 

The passage states: ""A ye bi 2 do ni ka dƐmƐdo ko 2 ni balon diili ye sen min fƐ 5-3 sebaaya sɔrɔla Athlata Thrashers kan Whasington. Ovechkin ka diili fɔlɔ kƐra sebayasɔrɔli bii do tunma degeden Nicklas Backstrom fƐ"" which translates to ""He scored 2 goals and had 2 assists in the game with a score of 5-3 against the Atlanta Thrashers. Ovechkin's assist came from Nicklas Backstrom.""

The question asks who scored the goals for the Washington Capitals against the Atlanta Thrashers. The first sentence establishes that Alex Ovechkin was the one who scored the goals, not Backstrom who assisted. 
"
Jɔnni y’a ka celu 60nan do Faabaw ka balonta ka ta Atlanta Thrashers juguyara?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text states: ""A ye bi 2 do ni ka dƐmƐdo ko 2 ni balon diili ye sen min fƐ 5-3 sebaaya sɔrɔla Athlata Thrashers kan Whasington. Ovechkin ka diili fɔlɔ kƐra sebayasɔrɔli bii do tunma degeden Nicklas Backstrom fƐ ; A ka o suu in celu filanan tun ye a ka sƐsɔn celu 60 nan de ye..."" This indicates Ovechkin scored 2 goals in the game against the Atlanta Thrashers and reached 60 points in a season. The subsequent sentence then compares his achievement to that of Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux, mentioning their dominance in the 1995-96 season.

The question asks who reached 60 points in a season and played for the Washington Capitals, which is Alex Ovechkin.
"
Waati jumɛn na Northern Rock Bank mako tun bɛ dɛmɛ na jamana marabulon yɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **B: Waati jumɛnna banki farala ka bɔ warimaraso minɛkoɲuma na**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""San 2010, a kɛni kɔ jamana ta ye, o waati warimaraso min tun bɛ siraba kan, Rock plc, farala ka bɔ """"warimaraso kolon"""" Northern Rock (minɛkoɲuma)..."" 
* This translates to: ""In 2010, it went to become a bank, the company that had previously failed, Rock plc, separated to form the ""remainder bank"" Northern Rock (the core business)...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Banki in kɛlen kɔ jamana ta ye:** While true, it doesn't specify *when* the bank became a bank.
* **C: Virgin Group kɛlen ka warimarasoɲuma sannen kɔfɛ:** Virgin Group became a shareholder, not a majority owner.
* **D: Lahawotafarankan waati:**  ""Lahawotafarankan"" means ""the time of the crisis"" and is too general. The question asks *when* the bank became a bank.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasenw jumɛn bi Virgin Group ka Northern Rock bank sani ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?","The correct answer is **D: Virgin Group ka wɛntɛrɛ fɔlɔ warimaraso la kɛra warimaraso kɛlɛ jamana ta ye.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group tun banan laɲini dɔ la sani warimaraso in ka kɛ jamana ta ye."" (Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group has been interested in becoming a major player in the banking sector.)
* **Later, it says:** ""San 2010, a kɛni kɔ jamana ta ye, o waati warimaraso min tun bɛ siraba kan, Rock plc, farala ka bɔ """"warimaraso kolon"""" Northern Rock (minɛkoɲuma) la. Virgin ye """" warimarasoɲuma"""" dɔrɔn san Northern Rock fɛ nka a ma kɛ minɛkoɲumajɛkulu ye."" (In 2010, it entered the banking sector, acquiring the salvaged Rock plc, which became the ""core banking"" Northern Rock (subsidiary). Virgin is the ""shareholder"" group of Northern Rock and is not a major subsidiary.)

Therefore, Virgin Group's involvement was as a shareholder in Northern Rock, meaning they invested in the bank. Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Virgin Group fana ye Northern Rock warimaraso minɛkoɲuma tun san** (Virgin Group is not a subsidiary of Northern Rock) - Incorrect. The passage explicitly states Virgin is *not* a subsidiary.
* **B: Virgin Group ye warimaraso san a kɛlen jamana warimaraso ye** (Virgin Group is a major player in the banking sector) - While Virgin *became* a major player, the passage emphasizes their initial *interest* and subsequent *shareholding* rather than being a major player from the outset.
* **C: Virgin Group tun ye dɛmɛ di warimaraso ma lahawotafarankan waati la** (Virgin Group was a subsidiary of the banking sector at that time) - Incorrect.  Virgin was *not* a subsidiary. They entered the sector by acquiring a salvaged entity.

"Inafɔ a fɔlen bɛ tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, jamana jumɛn ye ko sɔrɔ Kyoto bolonɔnbila waatiyɛlɛmabɛnkansɛbɛn na?","The correct answer is **A: Lameriki Jamana** (American Union).

The passage explicitly states: ""Mr. Rudd ka hakilina ka bolonɔnbila kɛ Kyoto watiyɛlɛmabɛnkansɛbɛn la ye Lameriki jamana to a kelenna setigijamanaw cɛma sisan min man bolonɔn bila bɛnkansɛbɛn na."" This translates to ""Mr. Rudd's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol is that of the American Union or a similar group of countries that are committed to the Protocol.""

Therefore, the passage directly identifies the American Union as being committed to the Kyoto Protocol. While other countries are mentioned, the passage specifically links the commitment to the American Union.
"
Ɔsitrali laadajamanamarabulonɲɛmɔgɔ miirila ko bolonɔn bila Kyoto bɛnkansɛbɛn na tun bina se ka mun lase u ma tɔrɔ la?,"The correct answer is **A: Lameriki jamana**.

This translates to: ""Mr. Rudd's [claim/argument] regarding the Kyoto protocol is that it is the American [position/stance] or a position adopted by the United States as a significant power.""

Therefore, the text directly links Mr. Rudd's position on the Kyoto Protocol to the **American position**.

Baarasira jumɛn tun hokumu kɔnɔ kisɛcilaw sifilɛli sugandila?,"The correct answer is **D: Farikoloɲɛnajɛ Kisɛcilaw ka Ton baarasira hokumu kɔnɔ**.

The text states: ""Yɛrɛbɔla jolenw sugandila farikoloɲɛnajɛ Kisɛcilaw ka Ton baarasira hokumu kɔnɔ."" which translates to ""The NSW government legislates on the protection of threatened species and ecosystems.""  The ""NSW government"" is referred to as ""Farikoloɲɛnajɛ Kisɛcilaw ka Ton"" in the provided text. Therefore, the answer is D.
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn ti banayɛlɛma kunbɛli sifilɛli tigitigi jira?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka d'a sifilɛli baarasira hokumu fɔlɔ kan, a tun ma jateminɛ**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yɛrɛbɔla jolenw sugandila farikoloɲɛnajɛ Kisɛcilaw ka Ton baarasira hokumu kɔnɔ."" (The community has been working with the local council to develop a management plan.)
* **The question asks:** ""Ninnu kumasen jumɛn ti banayɛlɛma kunbɛli sifilɛli tigitigi jira?"" (What is the purpose of the community's involvement in the development of the management plan?)
* **Option A directly answers the question** by stating that the management plan is being developed *with* the local council and is being developed *based on* a management plan. This implies the purpose is to create a framework for dealing with the issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kisɛcilaw ye kalan dafalen sɔrɔ** (The council is a source of support) - While true, it doesn't explain *why* the community is involved.
* **C: Kisɛcilaw tun lajɛlen do yiri lakanabaw fɛ** (The council is developing it based on community input) - The passage says they are working *with* the council, not *based on* community input.
* **D: Kisɛcilaw naani tun sugandila** (The council is developing it) - This is too simplistic and doesn't explain the community's role or the overall purpose.

The passage states: ""O kɔrɔ ye ɲɛɲini min tun sinsinna dugujukɔrɔfɛnw ma kɔnna kojugu farali ɲɛ."" (The land is a region where the earth is cracked and the rain is scarce.) and ""O kɔrɔ ye fɛnbɛɛ ka kan ka segin kɔ,"" (The land is wide and stretches far).  Then, Berhane Asfaw identifies the region: ""Rift Valley ɲɛɲinicakɛdaɲɛɲinikɛra Etiyopi ani ɲɛɲinibarakɛɲɔgɔn."" (The region is the Rift Valley of Ethiopia and the surrounding areas.)

Therefore, the question asks where this land is, and the answer is the Rift Valley.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de kɛra jona k’a kɔn waati makɔnɔnen ɲɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Fugujukɔrɔfɛn yeli**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the reason for the drought in the area?""  (Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de kɛra jona k’a kɔn waati makɔnɔnen ɲɛ?)
* **The text states:** ""O kɔrɔ ye ɲɛɲini min tun sinsinna dugujukɔrɔfɛnw ma kɔnna kojugu farali ɲɛ."" (The drought is a phenomenon that has been happening for a long time and it is becoming severe.)  This indicates the drought is caused by a lack of rain.
* **The text also mentions:** ""O kɔrɔ ye fɛnbɛɛ ka kan ka segin kɔ,"" (The drought is caused by the failure of the rains).

Therefore, ""Fugujukɔrɔfɛn yeli"" (Lack of rain) is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A farali** (It is severe) - This describes the severity of the drought, not the *reason* for it.
* **C: Molekili nɔ sɛgɛsɛgɛli** (Molekili is getting smaller) - This is irrelevant to the cause of the drought.
* **D: Rift Valley ɲɛɲinili** (Rift Valley rainfall) - While the Rift Valley is mentioned as a location, the text doesn't say the *rainfall itself* is the cause; it's the lack of rain.

Ɲɛnajɛkɛla mako bina se mun kɛli ma yalasa ka taanikaseginw kɛ ɲɛnajɛ kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: Talikɛlaw bilali jabarani kɛrɛfɛ (His dedication to the fans)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Satoru Iwata was known for his dedication to the fans and that he was a kind and respectful person who valued the opinions of others. Option C directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka labaaralikɛla talikɛlaw bila mansin kɛrɛfɛ (His dedication to the fans)** - This is the correct answer.
*   **B: U kɛyɔrɔ sumali (His love of food)** - The text doesn't mention anything about Iwata's love of food.
*   **D: Labaaralikɛla in munumununi fiyɛn fɛ (His deep sense of responsibility)** - While responsibility is part of his character, the text emphasizes his connection with fans more strongly.

Therefore, **C** is the best answer as it encapsulates the most prominent aspect of Satoru Iwata's personality described in the text."
Mun tun dilanna na bɔlen bɛ jabarani yɔrɔjanlabaarala fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Labaaralikɛla talikɛla fila**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A bɔlen do jabarani yɔrɔjanlabaarala dɔ fɛ, **labaaralikɛla in be baara kɛ ni talikɛla fila ye minnuw be bila jabarani kɛrɛfɛ k'a kɛyɔrɔ suma.**""

This translates to: ""He became a successful executive, **leading the development of the console and the software that made it successful.**""

Option A directly reflects this statement. The other options are either too specific (like mentioning Nintendo Revolution or Satoru Iwata) or don't accurately capture the meaning of the sentence.
"
Mun tun ma fɔ kunafoniw bɛɛ laban na Xinhua kunafoniso fɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Pankurun in tun damununa k'a ɲɛsin Afuganisitan ma** (The flour was used to make bread for the people of Afghanistan).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What did the flour (kunafoni) do?
* **The text states:** ""Kunafoni labanw y'a sɛbɛntiya tuguni ko pankurun in ye mugujugu farati Kunafoni dɔ sɔrɔ w'a y'a damunu ka jigin Afuganisitan jamana na Kandahar.""  This translates to ""The flour was used to make bread from flour. The flour was also used to provide food for the people of Afghanistan in Kandahar.""
* **Option C directly reflects this statement.**  It says the flour was used to feed the people of Afghanistan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pankurun in tun ye mugujugu farati sɔrɔ** (The flour was a major ingredient).  This is true, but doesn't answer *what it did*.
* **B: Pankurun in tun jiginna Ürümqi** (The flour was sent to Ürümqi).  The text says the bread *ended up* in Ürümqi after being sent from Afghanistan, but doesn't say the flour was directly sent *to* Ürümqi.
* **D: Pankurun in tun jiginna Kandahar** (The flour was sent to Kandahar). The text says the bread was for the *people of* Kandahar, not that the flour was *sent to* Kandahar.



"
Mun tun ma fɔ Xinhua baarabolo kura ka fɔlɔ fɔlɔ kibaruya fɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Pankurun nin tun dɛsɛlen ka jigin karabalen yamaruya la**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What did Xinhua report about the disappearance of the Kunafoni?"" (Mun tun ma fɔ Xinhua baarabolo kura ka fɔlɔ fɔlɔ kibaruya fɛ?)
* **The answer in the text states:** ""Kunnafoni fɔlɔfɔlɔw ko pankurun in damununa k'a ɲɛisin Afuganisitan jamana ma u dɛsɛlen kɔ ka jiginni karabalen yamaruya sɔrɔ Urumqi.""  This translates to: ""The Kunafoni and the goods disappeared, and they were found in the possession of Afghan nationals, who were later found to be carrying a shipment of yams to Urumqi.""

Option B accurately reflects this information. The text specifically mentions the disappearance of the goods and their later discovery with individuals carrying yams to Urumqi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pankurun nin tun kunmayɛlɛmana** (The goods were found). While true, this doesn't answer *what* Xinhua reported *about* the Kunafoni's disappearance.
* **C: Pankurun nin tun damununa k'a segi ka ta Afuganisitan** (The goods were found in Afghanistan).  This is partially true, but it doesn't explain the subsequent discovery in relation to Urumqi.
* **D: Pankurun nin tun ye mugujugu farati sɔrɔ** (The goods were a variety of high-quality fabrics). The text says the goods were ""yamaruya sɔrɔ"" which means yams, not fabrics.



"
Mun de tun ladɔnniya kɛra Sara Danius fɛ rajo kan jɛmukan dɔ senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Literatire Nobele jɔnjɔn sɔrɔbaga**.

The text explicitly states: ""TƐnnƐndo, Sara Danius, Siwisi Akademi Literatire Nobel komite sekeretƐri peremanan, ye jama ladɔnniya rajo kan jƐmukan dɔ senfƐ Sveriges Radio kan SiyƐde kɔnɔ ko komite in, a dƐsƐlen ka Bob Dylan yƐrƐlasɔrɔ ka kuma 2016 literatire Nobele jɔnjɔn sɔrɔliko kan, tun ye a weleli ko bolobila.""

This translates to: ""Tends, Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Swiss Academy of Literature, is a member of the jury who has been interviewed on Sveriges Radio about the committee, who announced that Bob Dylan won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, and also about their work.""

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Sara Danius is a member of the Nobel Prize in Literature jury.
"
Jɔnni de tun se ka sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The text states: ""Bob Dylan yƐrƐlasɔrɔ ka kuma 2016 literatire Nobele jɔnjɔn sɔrɔliko kan..."" which translates to ""Bob Dylan was awarded the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature..."" and then goes on to say he was also interviewed. Therefore, the question ""Jɔnni de tun se ka sɔrɔ?"" (Who was interviewed?) refers to Bob Dylan.
"
"""Jɔnni de tunna weleweleda tɔgɔda ko """"Senɲɛ Kankaran""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

Here's why:

The question asks who ""weleweleda"" (spoke) the phrase ""Senɲɛ Kankaran"". The first sentence states that Gordon Johndroe, the spokesperson for the United States Department of Defense, spoke the phrase. Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the answer.
"
Bolonɔnbilanaw joli tun dilanna Słania jamana caman ye?,"The correct answer is **D: 1,000 ni kɔ**.

The text states: ""A ye bolonɔnbilana 1000 ni a kunkanfɛn dilan Suwɛdi ni jamana 28 wɛrɛw ye."" This translates to ""There are 1000 [people] and a total of 28 Swedish and Japanese [people].""  Since the question asks about the number of people, and the number 1000 is mentioned directly before the total number of Swedish and Japanese people, the answer is 1000. The ""ni kɔ"" part is a stylistic element in the original text and doesn't change the core information.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de bɔlen do bondo da sɔgɔli banbali kun fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Marayɔrɔ filana tun bɛ ka fa ka s'a daan na.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Marayɔrɔ filana wɛrɛ bɛ bondo in duguma barikonw 104.500 bɛ don min kɔnɔ n'o tun man fa ka s'a daan na.""  This translates to ""The mayor's office said that the water level reached 104,500 cubic feet and that it was predicted to continue rising.""

The question asks what the water level is predicted to be. The answer is that the mayor's office predicted it would continue to rise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tasuma sɛgɛsɛli gansan dɔ senfɛ (Sediment from the south):** This refers to the *source* of the water, not the predicted level.
* **C: Fiɲɛbilada (Cubic feet):** This is a unit of measurement, not the predicted level itself.
* **D: Tasuma sɛgɛsɛli Fort Greely tajisamaniso dɔ kelenna (Sediment from the Fort Greely reservoir):** This also refers to the source, not the predicted level.



"
Munna bɔlidaw tun yɛlɛla?,"The correct answer is **A: Fiɲɛbilada tun bɛ bondo kɔnɔ** (The pipeline was built to transport oil).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the purpose of the pipeline: ""Trans-Alaska na nɛgɛburu-sira mayili 800 tun datugura k'a sabu kɛ taji kɛnɛ bara ba camaw bɔnni ye, Fairbanks baniyan fan fɛ, Alasika."" (The 800-mile Trans-Alaska pipeline was built to transport oil from Fairbanks, Alaska.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuran tun tigɛra sɛgɛsɛgɛli kɔfɛ** (It was built to carry military supplies): While the pipeline *could* be used for military purposes, the primary purpose described is oil transport.
* **C: Barikonw tun falen do ka s'u daan na** (The barrels fell and were lost): This refers to a specific incident mentioned later in the text and is not the reason for the pipeline's existence.
* **D: Marayɔrɔ filana tun se ka barogon caman ta** (The mayor said the oil reserves were 55,000 barrels): This is a specific detail about oil reserves, not the reason the pipeline was built.



"
"Ni waati in, The Ninth Ward ji jaɲan je joli ye?","The correct answer is **A: Fiti 20**.

The question asks ""Ni waati in, The Ninth Ward ji jaɲan je joli ye?"" which translates to ""How many years ago did The Ninth Ward get flooded?"". The text states: ""The Ninth Ward, min fala ji la fo fiti 20 ɲɔgɔnna Hurricane Katrina senfɛ..."" which means ""The Ninth Ward, which was flooded 20 years after Hurricane Katrina...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inci 6** - This refers to the height of the water.
*   **C: Ji min be cɛkisɛ la** - This refers to the fact that the water was checked.
*   **D: Fiti 100** - This refers to the area affected by the flooding.



"
"Hurricane Katrina senfɛ, mun tun kɛra The Ninth Ward la?","The correct answer is **C: Fala ji tun walankata la fo fiti 20 ɲɔgɔnna**.

Here's why:

* The question asks ""Mun tun kɛra The Ninth Ward la?"" which translates to ""What happened to The Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina?"".
* The provided text states: ""The Ninth Ward, min fala ji la fo fiti 20 ɲɔgɔnna Hurricane Katrina senfɛ..."" which translates to ""The Ninth Ward, it was affected by Hurricane Katrina 20 years ago...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fala ji tun walankata la fo fiti 100 boɲa furancɛ la** - This translates to ""It was affected by 100 times more water"".  The text doesn't mention a specific amount of water.
* **B: Cɛkisɛ ji fara ka a dama tɛmɛ** - This translates to ""It was inspected for the damage."" The text talks about being affected by the hurricane, not just inspected afterward.
* **D: Sanji inci 6 tun ye dɔ fara tiyɛnnen ninnu kan** - This translates to ""It is 6 inches tall and a very tall building."" This is irrelevant to the question about what happened during the hurricane.



Therefore, option C accurately answers the question about what happened to The Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.



"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen tun ma sɛmɛntiya Hamilton fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Banabaatɔ in tun tara yɔrɔ min**.

Here's why:

* The first sentence states that Hamilton and the Sanfège balance are being used to manage the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria.
* The second sentence mentions that the people (banabaatɔ) in Nigeria are being tested for Ebola.
* Therefore, the people in Nigeria are being tested for Ebola. Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Banabaatɔ tɔw ka bana kisɛ sigana sɔrɔli** (The people are getting very angry). While the situation is serious, the text doesn't explicitly state anger as a result of the testing.
* **C: N’a sɔrɔla banayɛlɛma kunbɛ taabolo tun bato la** (They are following the rules to eat food). This is about food rules, not the testing related to Ebola.
* **D: Banabaatɔ ka sisa lahala ya** (The people are having fun). This is completely unrelated to the context of an Ebola outbreak.



"
Ɲɛɲinikɛlaw b’a fɛ ka ko jumɛn ko?,"The correct answer is **B: Proteines dilannen do cogodi**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks: ""What does the protein (ɲɛɲinikɛlaw) do?""**
* **The text (P) states: ""kƐrƐkƐrƐnnen yala dugukolo danra cogo min, kabi ni doloɲɛdumanw ni dugukolo gosira ɲɔkɔn kun ka naa se fo sisan.""** This translates to ""It is responsible for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and also for the metabolism of sugars.""
* **The text also mentions: ""Proteines dilan ka balo nɔkɔya""** This translates to ""Proteins help to carry nutrients.""
* **Therefore, the protein's main function, according to the text, is to help carry nutrients (proteins dilan) and is involved in the metabolism of proteins.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waati jumɛnna tun doloɲɛdumanw gosira dugukolo la** (Water is a carrier of carbohydrates and fats). While water is involved in metabolism, the text specifically focuses on the protein's role.
* **C: Nɔkɔ jumɛn ko** (Nutrients are carried). This is true, but doesn't specify *what* carries them. The text points to proteins.
* **D: Dugukolo dilanbɛ cogodi** (Carbohydrates are metabolized). While carbohydrates are metabolized, the question asks about *the protein's* function, not the carbohydrate's.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** Who is searching for the missing people?
* **The passage states:** ""FBI nege tun wilila"" which translates to ""The FBI and its agents are searching.""
* **Option A directly reflects this information.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U tun y’a laɲini ka baara in ban:** This translates to ""We are looking for the missing people."" The passage states the FBI is doing this, not ""we.""
* **C: U tun ye mɔtɔtigiw bila ka taa sira wɛrɛ kan:** This translates to ""We are the drivers who were seen driving a car."" This is not what the passage says.
* **D: U tun ye sirakanboli dekun fɔ ka fara dugu siraba filana ka:** This translates to ""We are the police who started to gradually increase the search."" While the police might be involved, the passage specifically highlights the FBI's role.



"
Mun tun kɛra dingɛdondaw jɔsɔ waati la?,"The correct answer is **B: U tun kɛra inafɔ ka sira munumunu dɔ** (We were looking for people who were involved in the murder).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Mariland taakasegi ɲɛmɔgɔw ye baara ban ni FBI ye min nege tun wilila."" (Maryland authorities and the FBI have been looking for people who are involved in the murder.)
* **The text further says:** ""U tun kɛra dingɛdondaw jɔsɔ ani dɛmɛbaga lakanatigilamɔgɔ 80 tun wilini do ka jɔ walasa ka mɔtɔtigiw bila ka sira munu."" (We were looking for suspects and witnesses and 80 people have been questioned in the hope that they will provide information about the murder.)

Option B directly reflects this information, stating that they were looking for people *involved in the murder*. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: U tun balannen do** (We were praying for them) - This doesn't match the context of a police investigation.
* **C: U tun bɛ mɔtɔtigiw ka bila la** (We were catching the cars) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Degunba tun bɛ sirakanboli la** (The Beltway was being blocked) - While the Beltway was blocked, the question asks *what they were looking for*, not what was happening to the Beltway.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ɲanajɛ kunnafoniw bɔlɔlɔ sira TMZ b'a faamu ko jatala tuny'a ka bolifɛn jɔ Sepulveda nbɛda kɛrɛ dɔ in fɛ ani ka sɔrɔ ka lakanatigilamɔgɔw siracamanfarayɔrɔ jaw ta yani ka sira tigɛ ka sɔrɔ ka tɛmɛ ka taa...""  This translates to: ""The paparazzi from TMZ reported that the jet landed at Sepulveda Boulevard and was taken to a special treatment facility...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jatala tun bilalen do dosiracamanfarayɔrɔ yirabaga fɛ ka sira tigɛ tugun:** This translates to ""The jet was taken to a special facility for medical treatment."" While true, it's not as specific as option B, which mentions the location.
* **C: Jatala tun ye lakanatigilamɔgɔw jaw ta yani ka sira tigɛ:** This translates to ""The jet was taken to a special facility."" It's too general.
* **D: Jatala tun sera ka Bieber ka ja sɔrɔ:** This translates to ""The jet was to pick up Bieber."" While the text mentions Bieber, it doesn't state that the jet was *specifically* there for him. It's implied, but not explicitly stated.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the text.
"
Jatala tun be fɛ ka mun kɛ sanni a ka furan bolifɛn in fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka bolifɛn jɔ Sepulveda nbɛda la**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ɲanajɛ kunnafoniw bɔlɔlɔ sira TMZ b'a faamu ko jatala tuny'a ka bolifɛn jɔ Sepulveda nbɛda la..."" This translates to ""The paparazzi from TMZ reported that the Jatala was taken to the Sepulveda Boulevard hospital...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lakanatigilamɔgɔw jaw jatali yani ka sira tigɛ:**  While the text mentions doctors are involved, it doesn't specifically say they *took* the Jatala to the hospital. It says the Jatala *was taken* to the hospital.
* **C: Dosiracamanfarayɔrɔ degunnen tikɛli:** This translates to ""Doctors are being treated."" The text says doctors are involved in the investigation, but not that they are *being* treated.
* **D: Lakanatigilamɔgɔ lasɔnli ka to ka jata:** This translates to ""Doctors are being asked/interviewed."" While doctors might be questioned, the text doesn't explicitly state this.



"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn ti Peresidan ka lahaliya ɲɛfɔ a jiralen ko a ye banakisɛ juguba dɔ sɔrɔ tigi jira?,"The correct answer is **C: A ka lahaliya kafisa**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *who* is the President's chief of staff.
* The text states: ""Peresidan ka lahalya kafisa, hali ni a ye sɔrɔ a bena bila a kelen ka tile caaman kƐ.""  This translates to: ""The President's chief of staff, who is the person who has been with him since the beginning.""
* Therefore, the answer is the President's chief of staff.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A fari mandi a la** (It is a big problem) - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **B: Ɲɔɔnɔdimin b’ala** (The minister is not) - This is talking about the Minister of Foreign Affairs, not the chief of staff.
* **D: Farikalaya b’ala** (The journalist is not) - This is talking about a journalist, not the chief of staff."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasen jumɛnw Peresidan ka ye tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **C: A ka kɛnɛ kɔsɔbɛ nin la ka baara kɛ yɔrɔjanfɛ**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"I ne jigi be a kan ka segin n’ka baaraw bƐƐ ma ntƐnƐdɔ,"""" Arias ye o de fɔ kuma dɔ senfƐ."" This translates to: ""It is a matter that we must not tolerate any more,"" Arias said, emphasizing the urgent need to address the issue. The following sentence describes the situation: ""Farikalaya ni ɲɔɔnɔdimin, basi foyi te na wa n ka kƐnƐ kɔsɔbƐ nin la yasa n’ka baara kƐ yɔrɔjanfƐ."" This means: ""The police and military have been deployed to the area to secure it and prevent further violence.""

The question asks what the president's reaction is. The text indicates that the president's reaction is to deploy security forces to the area to control the situation and prevent more violence. Option C directly reflects this action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Farikalaya t’ala:** This is not mentioned in the text as the president's reaction.
*   **B: A bena bila so ka tile dɔgɔkun caman kɛ:** This option refers to a past action, not the current reaction.
*   **D: Banakisɛ juguba de y’a sɔrɔ:**  This describes the reason for the president's statement, not the statement itself.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jumɛnna Fiɲɛjuguba Gonu sigi tun kɛra ni o jigili ye ka taa a fɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Waati jumɛnna fiɲɛteliya tun bɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ 83 sanga kelen kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Waati jumɛnna Fiɲɛjuguba Gonu sigi tun kɛra ni o jigili ye ka taa a fɛ?"" which translates to ""How far did Fiɲɛjuguba Gonu travel?"".

The provided text states: ""Fiɲɛjuguba Gonu, min tɔgɔ dara ntenbulubɔrɔkelen na Malidivikan na, k'a to a dan bɛɛ la tun bɛ kɛ funufunuba min bɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ 240 boli sanga kelen kɔnɔ (nɔngɔnɲɛ 149 sanga kelen kɔnɔ).""  This means ""Fiɲɛjuguba Gonu, we went on a journey in the Maldives, either by land or by sea, traveled a total distance of 240 miles (149 kilometers).""

Then it continues: ""Bi sɔgɔmajona fɛ, fiɲɛteliya tun bɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ 83 sanga kelen kɔnɔ, ani sigi tun kɛra ni o jigili ye ka taa a fɛ."" This means ""On the other hand, by sea, Fiɲɛjuguba Gonu traveled 83 kilometers, and then continued to travel until it reached its destination.""

Therefore, the answer to ""How far did Fiɲɛjuguba Gonu travel?"" is **83 kilometers**. Option B directly states this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sanni ka se Malidivi ma** (It is in the Maldives) - This is a true statement but doesn't answer the question of distance.
* **C: Sanni ka s’a dan bɛɛ la** (It is by land) - The text states it could be by land *or* sea, and doesn't tell us which mode of transport it used for the 83 km.
* **D: Fiɲɛteliya tun bɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ 240 boli sanga kelen kɔnɔ** (By sea, it traveled 240 miles) - This refers to the total distance (land *or* sea), not specifically the distance traveled by sea.
"
Fiɲɛteliya dan tun bɛ joli Fiɲɛjuguba Gonu senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Nɔngɔnɲɛ 240 sanga kelen kɔnɔ**.

The passage states: ""k'a to a dan bɛɛ la tun bɛ kɛ funufunuba min bɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ 240 boli sanga kelen kɔnɔ (nɔngɔnɲɛ 149 sanga kelen kɔnɔ)."" This translates to: ""It took to travel from there to the other side, it was a distance of 240 nautical miles (149 statute miles).""  The question asks how far the *fiɲɛteliya* (boat) traveled from Fiɲɛjuguba Gonu.  The passage specifies that it traveled 240 nautical miles.
"
Ninnu jumɛn ti jate Karenia brevis sɔn fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Yɛrɛlapoyisababuw suguya dɔ do** (The police investigation revealed that).

The passage states: ""Yɛrɛlapoyisababuw bɛ se ka nerotokesine dii min bese adamadenw ni jƐgƐw fila bƐƐ fasaw ja."" which translates to ""The police investigation revealed that the victims and their families were killed by a snake bite.""

Therefore, the police investigation revealed that a snake bite caused the deaths. The other options are incorrect.
"
Ninnu jumɛn ma se ka kɛ Karena brevis fɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Nerotokesine dili**.

The passage states: ""Jifunufunubile sababu ye faraɲɔgɔnkanba min tɛ deli ka kɛ Karenia brevis fɛ, min ye kɔkɔjikuruso ye min bɛ bɔ a yɛrɛ ma."" This translates to: ""The reason was the presence of a foreign substance that was found to be *Nerotokesine dili*, which is a type of bacteria that caused his illness.""

Therefore, the question ""Ninnu jumɛn ma se ka kɛ Karena brevis fɛ?"" (What was the cause of his illness?) has the answer ""Nerotokesine dili"".
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn makɛ inafɔ Felicia sanfiɲɛba nɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Sankisɛ nafama** (Storm surge).

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""SankisƐw, sera fo 6,34 pusew ma ni suguya dɔ ye Oahu kunna, lakalira i na fɔ ​​‘’ ko nafama’’. "" This translates to ""Storm surge, which affected 6.34 percent of Oahu residents, was the reason for the 'coastal flooding'.""  ""SankisƐw"" directly refers to storm surge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sankisɛ tugulen sanfiɲɛba la** (Storm surge is) - This is too general and doesn't pinpoint the *cause* of the damage.
* **C: Tuma ni tuma sanpɛrɛn** (Rain and flooding) - While rain and flooding are mentioned, the passage specifically identifies storm surge as the major contributing factor in this case.
* **D: Jiiwalagatali sira ka** (Dam construction) - This is not mentioned in the passage.

The passage states: ""SankisƐw, sera fo 6,34 pusew ma ni suguya dɔ ye Oahu kunna, lakalira i na fɔ ‘ko nafama’."" This translates to ""Storm surge, which affects 6.34 percent of the population in Oahu, is considered 'not dangerous'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A tun sigiyɔrɔmalen be inafɔ depresiyɔn tropical dɔ sann’a ka kɛ sanfiɲɛba hakɛ 4 dɔ ye:** While the storm *is* a Category 4 hurricane, the question asks what the storm *did*. This option describes its category, not its impact.
* **C: Gunw fanba bɛɛ tun ye sanjiiba ye:**  This states that the storm surge is considered a danger, which is not what the passage says. The passage says it's considered ""not dangerous.""
* **D: Sankisɛ dɔ tun tugulen bɛ sanpɛrɛn na:** This states that the storm surge is considered to be a threat to power lines, which is not directly mentioned in the passage.

Ninnu kumasen jumɛn bi Hɔngiri 2009 Grand Prix kɔ jabi tigitigi jira?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. tun bilara ka bɔbarala kɔfɛ** (Piquet Jr. was disqualified from the race).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Piquet Jr. Bilara ka bɔbarala Hɔngiri 2009 Grand Prix kɔfƐ."" This translates to ""Piquet Jr. was disqualified from the British 2009 Grand Prix.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernado Alonso tun sen dona mobili kasara dɔ la** (Fernando Alonso had a mechanical failure). While true, the question asks about *why* the race was chaotic, and Piquet Jr.'s disqualification is the direct cause mentioned in the text. Alonso's issue was a contributing factor, but not the main reason for the chaos.
* **B: Piquet Jr. ye sebaya sɔrɔ** (Piquet Jr. caused a crash). The text says Piquet Jr. was disqualified, not that he caused a crash.
* **D: Lakana mobili tun sen dona mobili kasara dɔ la** (The cars had mechanical failures). The text doesn't state that the cars generally had mechanical failures.



"
Waati jumɛn kasara in kɛra?,"The correct answer is **C: Sanni lakana mobili tun ka bɔ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Piquet Jr. ye a yƐrƐ ta ka pƐrƐn san 2008 Singapure Grand Prix la, a jɔlen kɔfƐ Fernando Alonso ka guwata kɔrɔ , yasa ka lakana mobili labɔ."" This translates to: ""Piquet Jr. was accused of deliberately crashing in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, which allowed Fernando Alonso to win the race, and thus win the championship.""
* **Option C directly reflects this:**  ""Sanni lakana mobili tun ka bɔ"" translates to ""He deliberately crashed the car.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A jɔlen kɔfɛ Alonso ka guwata kɔrɔ dɔrɔn** - This translates to ""He allowed Alonso to win the race."" While true, it doesn't specifically address *how* he did it, which is the core of the question.
* **B: Tuma minna mobili tɔw tun bɛ taji ta la** - This translates to ""He crashed the car."" This is incomplete; it doesn't mention the *reason* or *purpose* of the crash.
* **D: Piquet taalen kɔfɛ taji ta la** - This translates to ""Piquet's team crashed the car."" The passage attributes the crash to Piquet Jr. personally, not his team.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn tun ma waati jan taa ka tɛmɛ ɲɛɲinnikɛlawka jate fɔlɔ kan?","The correct answer is **D: Kɔnɔsukuyakuraw bɔli** (The universities).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ɲɛɲinnikɛlaw ka bɔ Prince University Etats Unis kɔnɔ ani Uppsala University Swede kɔnɔ ye kɔnɔsukuyakuraw nunu kofɔ yɛlɛma ko fila durɔn kɔnɔ..."" which translates to ""Scientists from Prince University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have conducted research...""

The question asks *who* conducted the research. The passage explicitly names the universities where the scientists are from.
"
Ninnu jumɛn tun ma kofɔ ɲɛɲinnikɛlaw fɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Kɔnɔsukuyakuraw ninnu tɔgɔ**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ɲɛɲinnikɛlaw ka bɔ Prince University Etats Unis kɔnɔ ani Uppsala University Swede kɔnɔ ye kɔnɔsukuyakuraw nunu kofɔ yɛlɛma ko fila durɔn kɔnɔ..."" which translates to ""Scientists at Prince University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden are conducting research and field studies...""
* **The question asks:** ""Ninnu jumɛn tun ma kofɔ ɲɛɲinnikɛlaw fɛ?"" which translates to ""What are the scientists studying?"".
* **The text then lists specific examples of their research subjects:** ""...ali n'a sɔrɔ a ko i yera ko a kajan, k'o sabu kɛ balo ye cɔrɔnideni Darwin ni Geospiza fortes, ani cactus cɔrɔni, Geospiza Conirostris cɛ."" which translates to ""...which is related to the origin of species and the work of Darwin and the Geospiza fortes, and the cactus species, Geospiza Conirostris, etc.""

Therefore, the scientists are studying **the origin of species**.  ""Ninnu tɔgɔ"" means ""the origin"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kɔnɔsukuyakuraw tun be ka dilan yɔrɔ min** (Scientists are studying a particular subject) - This is too vague. While they *are* studying a particular subject, it's not specified here.
* **B: Kɔnɔsukuyakuraw bɔli jayan** (Scientists are studying animals) - While some of their research involves animals (like the Geospiza birds), it's not the *sole* focus.
* **D: Kɔnɔsukuyakuraw ninnu baloli** (Scientists are studying plants) - While they study plants (the cactus species), it's not the sole focus.

**Therefore, option C, ""Kɔnɔsukuyakuraw ninnu tɔgɔ"" (The origin), is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.**"
Misi Yɛgɛleli binna kɛ min?,"The correct answer is **C: Erɔpu tilebin-kɔrɔnyanfa fɛ**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Who is Miss Yɛgɛleli?"".  The text states: ""...mi kɛla zuwɛn ni uti kalow ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ ni san i na, ni o kɛla jamakafowale ye mi ɲɔgɔn ma deli ka kɛ dunuya kɔnɔ."" This translates to ""...I am a person who lives in the city and has a different language, and she is a woman from the European television network who delivers my message to the world.""  Therefore, Miss Yɛgɛleli is a woman from a European television network.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Romani dugubaw caman na:**  The text doesn't mention Roma people.
* **B: Bucharest duguba kɔnɔ:**  Bucharest is the capital of Romania, and while it's in Europe, the text doesn't specify her location.  The focus is on her *affiliation* with a television network.
* **D: Erɔpu jamana faabaw caman na:** The text doesn't indicate that she is a representative of European fashion.



"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn bi Misi Yɛgɛleli ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?,"The correct answer is **C: Seko jirali do min tun kɛra tilema kɔnɔ Erɔpu tilebin-kɔrɔnyanfan fɛ**.

Here's why:

The question asks where Miss Yegeleli *used to* work. The text states: ""Dugu i bɛ na kɛ a siɲɛ fɔlɔ ye ka taama kɛ ni missi yɛgɛlew ye erɔpu tilebin-kɔrɔnyanfa na mi kɛla zuwɛn ni uti kalow ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ ni san i na, ni o kɛla jamakafowale ye mi ɲɔgɔn ma deli ka kɛ dunuya kɔnɔ.""  This translates to: ""She used to work in a job that involved working for European television channels, and she was a reporter or a camera operator, or a news presenter, and she also worked for my news agency and delivered my news to the world.""

Option C accurately reflects this information: ""Seko jirali do min tun kɛra tilema kɔnɔ Erɔpu tilebin-kɔrɔnyanfan fɛ"" which translates to ""She used to work for European television channels.""
"
Mun de y’a to Irisi II-76 labaarali jɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: Sowiyeti kɛlɛbolo**.

The text states: ""...w'a delila k'a ye kasara juguma dɔ la Irisi jamana kɔnɔ kalo tɛmɛnen. **Irisi jamana ye II-76 lapanni jɔ waati kunkurun na kasara in kɔfɛ.**"" This means the Irisi II-76 was a Soviet-made aircraft.
"
Mun ye II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Pankurun dɔ**.

The passage states: ""Pankurun in kun kunsinnen do Irikusiki ma wa tun be ka boli kɔnɔna kuluw fɛ."" This translates to something like ""The Pankurun, in its kind, is a vehicle that carries people and goods.""  The rest of the passage discusses the II-76 as a type of Pankurun.

Therefore, the II-76 is a type of Pankurun.
"
Jɔnni ye Simpson sɛbɛnba kulu ta?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

The text states: ""San 1989 a sen yera Simpson la ani Brooks ni Groening wa jɛmukan in sɛbɛnba kulu fɔlɔ tali tunb'a bolo."" which translates to ""In 1989, Simpson teamed up with Brooks and Groening to create the show."" 

Therefore, Groening was a key figure in creating The Simpsons.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni Fluke fɛla ye, jɔnni tun bɛ ka hakilinaɲumaw ni maguwan kumaw ci?","The correct answer is **D: Musow ni cɛw** (Both humans and animals).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Fluke y'a sɛbɛn ko dɔw ka fɛɛrɛw tiɲɛna minnu tun dabɔra ka musow bali ka kuma u ka kɛnɛya kan.""  This translates to: ""Fluke has been seen to be a disease that humans and animals can contract and it can cause their deaths.""
* **The question asks:** ""Who are the humans and animals that Fluke affects?""
* **The text explicitly mentions both ""musow"" (animals) and ""cɛw"" (humans).** Therefore, option D is the accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dɔgɔtɔrɔw (Doctors):** The text doesn't mention doctors being affected by Fluke.
* **B: Musow ka kɛnɛya lafasabaw (Domestic animals):** While animals are mentioned, the text doesn't specify only domestic animals.
* **C: Cɛw (Humans):** The text mentions humans, but not exclusively them.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ dɔw ta fɛ muso ka kuman mun ka?","The correct answer is **C: Musow ka kɛnɛya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fluke y'a sɛbɛn ko dɔw ka fɛɛrɛw tiɲɛna minnu tun dabɔra ka musow bali ka kuma u ka kɛnɛya kan."" This translates to: ""Fluke has been using a tool that measures the moisture content of wood to determine its dryness.""
* **The question asks:** ""If the wood is very dry, what is the tool used to measure it?""
* **The passage then says:** ""...a la musow ni cɛw fɛ k'a ka a ɲini ka bangekɔlɔsi jateminɛ furakɛli dɔ ye."" This translates to ""...a tool that measures the moisture content and is used to determine the dryness.""

Therefore, the tool used is a **musow ka kɛnɛya** (a moisture meter).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cɛmaw** (Clay): This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **B: Kɛnɛya musakaw** (Wood moisture): This is a description of what the tool measures, not the tool itself.
* **D: Fluke:** Fluke is the brand of the tool, not the name of the tool itself.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dolomanfɛn kelen jumɛn de galabu ka kɛnɛ bɛla ye?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The question asks what celestial body is mentioned as being the destination of the ""Dugukolo."" The passage states: ""...wa tɔgɔ ye Dugukolo"" which translates to ""...and it goes to Dugukolo.""

The passage also mentions ""dolomanfɛn kelen dɔrɔn de galabu ka kɛnɛ ni Titan ye, wa tɔgɔ ye Dugukolo"", which translates to ""...and the Jupiter-like moon that is the home of the giant is Titan, it goes to Dugukolo.""

Therefore, Titan is the destination of the Dugukolo.
"
Kɔw ni lakiw ka ji jɛli tun yera dolomanfɛn kelen jumɛn de ka?,"The answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes a place where liquid (ji) exists and is found even in the atmosphere (jɛlen do). It then mentions ""dolomanfɛn kelen dɔrɔn de galabu ka kɛnɛ ni Titan ye"" which translates to ""giant planets with a cloudy atmosphere like Titan."" 

Therefore, the text directly points to **Titan** as the location being described.
"
Ninnu jabi jumɛn ma sɔrɔ jolo sɛnbɛntiya fɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Sɛnbɛntiyali ka fɔ ko jolo bɛ dinozɔri caman fɛ**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Nin lakodonni fƐnnƐn be a to kɔnɔw siiko ɲƐtaa ka faamu kaɲƐ kɔsɔbƐ. Sabula dinosoriw sikalaw ma janya ka ɲƐ, min ni a be wele ko rasi, ɲa siiw kƐcogo wƐrƐw be a ala – siikisƐ ni sii - ɲinninlikƐbaw ye a famu ko rasiw tun be janya ka bɔ u yƐrƐla a cogoya tow kɔfƐ.""

This translates to: ""Fruits are often sweet, and dinosaurs, when they walked, had a strong bite, and their fruits were often sweet, and they would eat them to satisfy their hunger.""

This directly links the sweet taste of fruits to the dinosaurs' eating habits and the characteristics of the fruits they consumed. Option D accurately reflects this connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Datanfɛn in faarikansi kulɛri (Dinosaur bones are colorful):** The text doesn't mention the color of dinosaur bones.
* **B: Faamuyali min ba jira ko jolo tun ma kɛ ka pannikɛ (Fruits that are often eaten by dinosaurs):** While the text says dinosaurs ate fruits, it doesn't specify *which* fruits they often ate beyond them being sweet.
* **C: Kɔnɔw siiko ɲɛtaa faamu li (Often sweet fruits):**  While the text mentions sweet fruits, option D is a more complete answer as it connects the sweetness to the dinosaurs' eating habits and the characteristics of the fruits they consumed.



"
Mun tun tɛ dinozɔri jolo ma na?,"The correct answer is **C: Kɔrɔbalen sii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dinosoriw sikalaw ma janya ka ɲƐ, min ni a be wele ko rasi, ɲa siiw kƐcogo wƐrƐw be a ala – siikisƐ ni sii - ɲinninlikƐbaw ye a famu ko rasiw tun be janya ka bɔ u yƐrƐla a cogoya tow kɔfƐ."" This translates to: ""Dinosaurs, when they died, the remains of their bodies - bones and other things - of their flesh were left, and the bones were left to be eaten by the earth.""

Later, the text says: ""Ɲinnilaw ye u ka halikilina jira ko, halini dinɔsɔridenni de kukala ko do, esantiyɔn in be a kɔrɔbalen sii de jira ɲa jƐgƐfara tƐ.""  This translates to: ""The earth swallows them, the remains of the dinosaurs are gradually consumed by the earth.""

Therefore, the earth consumes the dinosaurs' remains **kɔrɔbalen sii** (gradually).  Option C accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sii** - Means ""yes"". It doesn't relate to what the dinosaurs are made of or how they disappear.
*   **B: Rasi** - Means ""bones"". While bones are part of the remains, the text indicates a more complete consumption by the earth.
*   **D: Ɲɛn kɔrɔla yanfa ladibilen** - Means ""red skin, fat, and flesh"". This is just a description of the dinosaur's body, not what it becomes after death.



"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn ye tiɲɛn ye ZMapp?,"The correct answer is **C: A tun be kɛ ka jateminɛ kɛ PALM mafilɛli la**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""PALM mafilƐli la, ZMapp kƐra ka jateminƐ de ye..."" which translates to ""PALM facility, ZMapp is a result of research there...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A dilan bɛ ni faarikolo dɛmɛlan jiw ye** (It is a result of the research of many people): While true, the passage focuses on the PALM facility specifically.
* **B: A be se ka senkɔrɔ banakisɛw lakodɔnnen kɛlɛ nka te se k’a saya bali** (It is said that it is very effective in treating infected people and can save lives): The passage mentions ZMapp's effectiveness but doesn't claim it's ""said"" to be that way. It states its potential to save lives.
* **D: Ɲininiw y’a jira k’a nafa ka dɔgɔ ka tɛmɛn min tun miiri la fɔlɔ ka** (People have taken it and are showing a decrease in the amount of fluids they produce): While this describes a potential effect of ZMapp, the passage doesn't specifically say this is what people are observing.



"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn bi PALM mafilɛli ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?,"The correct answer is **D: A tun y’a jira ko fura ɲɛnɛman do banakisɛw lakodɔnnen kɛlɛ la.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""PALM mafilɛli la, ZMapp kƐra ka jateminƐ de ye, a be i nafɔ dɔnnikƐlaw ye a taa ka baarakƐ ni a ye i nafɔ jateminƐlan ani u ye a sanga furakƐlicogo saba wƐrƐw ma.""  This means PALM is a vaccine that is being tested and has shown to reduce the severity of the disease and that it is also being tested on people with a high risk of severe illness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ɲininiw tun y’a jira ka be se nafa caman sɔrɔ ka tɛmɛ miiri fɔlɔ ka:** This is not mentioned in the text.
* **B: Fura jateminɛnen tun bɛ ka sankan ni fura suguya wɛrɛ saba ye, u dɔla kelen ye ZMapp ye:** The text says ZMapp is *different* from the other experimental treatments, not that it's similar.
* **C: ZMapp tun kɛra ka mafilɛli kɛ:**  The text says ZMapp is a vaccine, not a medication.



"
Yɔrɔ jumɛn na ɲinninikɛlaw y’a miiri ko pisi kura in binna kɛ nafaba ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Dɛsɛbato jamanaw (The 1980s)**.

The text states: ""Pisi fitifitinin do min bese ka dilan ni Ɛnpirmanti ankirima ye US wari tama ɲɔgɔnna a kelen o kelen songɔ ye."" which translates to ""The initial research and development in the US led to a growing awareness of the disease."" The text then mentions the emergence of diseases like AIDS and Hepatitis.  The passage explicitly mentions these diseases becoming prominent in the **1980s**.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Setigi jamanaw (The 1970s):** While research was happening, the major awareness and emergence of these diseases came later.
* **C: United States kɔnɔ (The United States):** While the US was the location of the research, the question asks about the *time period* the research *led to awareness*.
* **D: Stanford sanfɛkalanso la (Stanford Institution):** Stanford was one institution involved, but the text is broader than just Stanford. It refers to research and development across the US.



"
Fɛɛrɛ jumɛn binna tigɛ ka sɛgɛsɛgɛli minanw dilan?,"The correct answer is **B: Ɛnpirmanti ankirimaw (Research institutions)**.

The text states: ""Pisi fitifitinin do min bese ka dilan ni Ɛnpirmanti ankirima ye US wari tama ɲɔgɔnna a kelen o kelen songɔ ye.""  This translates to: ""The studies done by research institutions in the US are the most advanced...""

Therefore, the research institutions are the ones conducting the studies on adolescent sexual health.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn jolinɔ fununen ka te tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **A: Faralawaleya ko minnu nu y'a kɛ u ma mɛ kosɔbɛ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where people are becoming increasingly preoccupied with their own worries and are neglecting their families.** The phrases ""wele ko jolinɔ fununen"" (become preoccupied with their own worries) and ""inafɔ min kɛra kalo ka dɔnidɔni fɔsɔnni fɛ"" (neglect their families) clearly indicate this.
* **The question asks *what* causes this phenomenon (the preoccupation).**
* **Option A directly addresses this cause:** ""Faralawaleya ko minnu nu y'a kɛ u ma mɛ kosɔbɛ"" translates to ""Worries and problems that are too difficult to bear.""  This directly links the preoccupation to the burden of difficult problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U kɛli ye b’a jira ko kalo farala-lawaleya ko foyi te ye** (It is a result of a strong desire for wealth and material possessions). While wealth *could* contribute, the passage focuses on worries and problems, not specifically material desires.
* **C: U be se ka kɛ kalo fɔsɔnni ye nɔn ye** (It is only a problem of the elderly). The passage doesn't limit the issue to just the elderly; it describes a broader trend.
* **D: U tun ma ca ka se kalo sanfɛ** (It is a result of a lack of respect for family). The passage focuses on worry and neglect, not necessarily a lack of respect.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately answers the question about the cause of the increasing preoccupation with worries.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, hakilinasira jumɛn ka ɲɛsin yɔrɔkɛcogo ma b’a jira ko kalo farala-lawaleya bɛ sena kalo sanfɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Yɔrɔkɛcogow hakɛ tamadɔnni de bɛ kalo sanfɛ**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the reason why the human race (yɔrɔkɛcogo) has been facing a lot of problems and is constantly suffering?""  This is essentially asking for the *cause* of human suffering.

* **The passage states:** ""Ni hakilinasira in be kuma sɔsɔ min b'a fɔ ko farala-lawaleya ko foyi te kalo kan."" This translates to ""And the reason is that people have been constantly engaging in conflict and violence.""

* **Option C directly reflects this:** ""The reason is that the human race has been constantly engaging in conflict and violence."" (Yɔrɔkɛcogow hakɛ tamadɔnni de bɛ kalo sanfɛ)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kalo bi ka fɔsɔnni dɔnidɔni** (The problem is constant suffering) - This is a restatement of the problem, not the *reason* for it.
* **B: Yɔrɔkɛcogow tun dilanna waati ja** (The human race has a natural tendency towards evil) - While there might be a philosophical debate about this, the passage specifically points to conflict and violence.
* **D: Yɔrɔkɛcogow tun dilanna kɔsan in na** (The human race has a tendency to be selfish) - Similar to B, this isn't directly supported by the passage, which focuses on conflict.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer because it directly identifies conflict and violence as the reason for human suffering according to the provided text.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de caman tina sɔrɔ fo jalakili ka kɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Jaw jɛnsɛnni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A datugulen do jalakili ni kiiri makɔnɔni na, nka seere jonjon bɛɛ be se ka yurukuyuruku ka d'a kan aka jaw jɛnsɛnna kɔsɛbɛ."" This translates to ""The investigation by the sheriff and his team, after a brief hearing, resulted in a call for a public inquiry into the incident.""

The question asks what the result of the investigation was. The text clearly says the result was a call for a **public inquiry (jaw jɛnsɛnni)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ɲɛfɔli wɛrɛw (News reports):** While this incident would likely be reported in news, the text itself *is* the report.
* **C: Seereya kumaɲɔgɔnyaliw (Legal documents):** The text describes an investigation, not legal documents.
* **D: Aritikili bɔliw (Articles of law):** This is irrelevant to the content of the text.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tɛ jɛgɛminɛkurun mɔgɔw ka sisan gɛlɛya ye?","The correct answer is **D: Jikuru jiginni**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the topic of the story?"" (Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tɛ jɛgɛminɛkurun mɔgɔw ka sisan gɛlɛya ye?)
* **The story's beginning:**  The story starts by mentioning a ""jikuru jiginni"" (a type of spiritual practice or ritual).
* **The rest of the text:** The rest of the text details someone named Pittman and their connection to this ""jikuru jiginni"" and a specific length of time (15 years).

Therefore, the central topic is the ""jikuru jiginni.""
"
"Ka fara jikuru ka, mun wɛrɛ kɛra lakisili wilikajɔw la?","The correct answer is **D: Jɛgɛminɛkurun mɔgɔw**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""...Pittman hakilina la jikuru hakɛba in ye a bɛɛ la juguman ye min ɲɔgɔn ma kɛ jɛgɛminɛkurunw na san 15 tɛmɛn in na.""

This translates to: ""...Pittman's agreement was to fulfill the requirements and the money related to the mining of 15 days.""

Therefore, the question ""Ka fara jikuru ka, mun wɛrɛ kɛra lakisili wilikajɔw la?""  which means ""What is the subject of the agreement?"",  is answered by ""Jɛgɛminɛkurun mɔgɔw"" (Mining).



"
Dannaya jumɛn tun ya to Roberts ma sɔn?,"The correct answer is **A: Hakili ɲuman jateminɛ (Human rights)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Roberts told the person that they had the right to vote and that they should have the right to elect their leaders. It then mentions Roe v. Wade and the concept of ""a woman's right to choose."" These points all relate to **human rights**, specifically rights related to voting and bodily autonomy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sanfɛ Kiiribulon ka kiiri ɲuman nafa (The president of South Sudan's population):** While the president is mentioned, the core of Roberts' statement is about rights, not specifically the president's population.
* **C: Ɲɛnɛmaya daminɛ (The majority of the population):** The text doesn't focus on the majority of the population but rather on the individual's right to vote and elect leaders.
* **D: Dogodogoli hakɛ (General rights):** While related, ""human rights"" is a more specific and accurate term encompassing the rights discussed in the text.

Therefore, **A: Hakili ɲuman jateminɛ (Human rights)** is the most fitting answer."
Roberts tun miiri la hakilina jugu jumɛn kuman maɲi?,"The correct answer is **B: Roev. Wade ka dantigɛli**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nka, a seginn'a ka kuma tɛmɛnen kan ko Roev. Wade tunye """"dugukolo sariyasen labɛnnen in ye""""...""  This translates to: ""Therefore, he said that Roev. Wade had a precedent that...""  The question asks who has a precedent mentioned in the text.  The answer is Roev. Wade.
"
Yeelen sira fila bɛ min?,"The correct answer is **A: Ɲɛsin sankolo ma** (The songs of the elders).

Here's why:

The question ""Yeelen sira fila bɛ min?"" translates to ""What are the songs of the elders?"".

The sentence ""Yeelen sira fila tigɛra ka u ɲɛsin fo sankolo ma su kɔnɔ"" translates to ""The songs of the elders are sung in the name of the ancestors.""

Therefore, the answer is ""Ɲɛsin sankolo ma"" which means ""The songs of the elders"" or ""Songs of the ancestors"".



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jumɛnna sangasojan jɔlibaaraw tun be sen na a yɔrɔ la?","The correct answer is **D: Jɔlibaaraw be sena**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What is the reason why the drums (sangasojan jɔlibaaraw) are being played?""
* **The text (P) states:** ""Yen yɔrɔ la sangasojan duuru jɔlibaaraw be sen na, ani taama soba kelen ani hakilijigin tamasere camacɛ la."" This translates to: ""They play the drums with great energy, and also with a loud noise and with a beautiful and skillful rhythm.""

Therefore, the reason the drums are being played is **because the drums are being played (Jɔlibaaraw be sena)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tile camacɛ la:** ""The rhythm"" - This is a consequence of the drumming, not the reason for it.
* **B: 8:46 waati:** ""8:46 o'clock"" - This is a time mentioned in the text, but not the reason for the drumming.
* **C: Su kɔnɔ:** ""How"" - This is a question word, not a reason.

Kunnafoni jumɛn y’a jira ko Balimamuso Wolonfilaw ye kuluwow de ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuluwow don da kɔnɔbonya** (Minerals that are economically viable).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kuluwodondaw bɛɛ minnu tɔgɔ tun ye """"Balimamuso Wolonfilaw"""" ye, janya dɔgɔmani ye k'a bɔ nɔngɔnɲɛ 100 la ka taa nɔngɔnɲɛ 250 la ( ka bɔ senɲɛda 328 la ka ta 820 la) kɔnɔbonya na."" This translates to: ""The study of minerals is known as 'Balimamuso Wolonfilaw', where the country produces between 100 and 250 (or 328 to 820) types of minerals economically.""  The key phrase is ""kɔnɔbonya na,"" meaning ""economically.""

The question asks what minerals are produced by Balimamuso Wolonfilaw. The text explicitly says the minerals are ""kɔnɔbonya na"" - economically viable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waatiyɛlɛmaw** (Geological Survey): While a geological survey is *involved* in studying minerals, it's not the *minerals themselves*.
* **C: Geological Survey:** Same reason as A.
* **D: Kuluwow jaw dugukolo kan** (Specific, valuable minerals): The text doesn't mention specific valuable minerals; it refers to a large *number* of minerals, but crucially, emphasizes their *economic viability*.



"
Funteni hakɛ bɛ cogodi Balimamuso Wolonfilaw jateminɛnina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ɛnfirauruzijaw (Scientists)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ɛnfirauruzijaw b'a yira ko su ni tile, waatiyɛlɛmaw b'a yira k'a fɔ kuluwow de don.""  This translates to ""Scientists are constantly researching and are working to improve the efficiency of the turbines.""

Therefore, scientists are the ones working to improve the Balimamuso Wolonfilaw.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn te tiɲɛn ye siga mɔgɔ in ka?","The correct answer is **C: A siya dɔnnen do lakanatigilamɔgɔw fɛ**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where Uighur people are facing difficulties and being targeted.** The first paragraph states ""A b'nafɔ ko cɛ in ya sensaba mɔbili dɔ boli mugujuguw tun be min na k'a ɲɛsin jama dɔ ma."" which translates to ""They have been constantly harassed by the authorities and are being targeted as a minority group.""
* **The question asks about the reason for the situation.**  The question ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn te tiɲɛn ye siga mɔgɔ in ka?"" means ""What is the reason for this situation, what is the cause of the persecution?""
* **Option C directly addresses the root cause.** ""A siya dɔnnen do lakanatigilamɔgɔw fɛ"" translates to ""The state has been using oppressive methods."" This aligns perfectly with the idea that the Uighur people are facing harassment and being targeted by the authorities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bolimafɛ tun b’a bolo binkanni wale kɔnɔ** (They have been using their power to collect information) - While this might be *part* of the harassment, it doesn't explain *why* they are collecting the information in the first place.
* **B: A tun y’a tukun ka mugujugu in ci** (They have been using propaganda to spread lies) - Again, this is a potential tactic, but not the core reason for the targeting.
* **D: A tun ma bana** (They have been being unreasonable) - This is completely unrelated to the context of persecution and targeted harassment.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that provides a logical and direct answer to the question about the cause of the situation.



"
Ka ɲɛsin binkanni wale kunnafoni jumɛn tin sɛmɛntiyala lakanatigilamɔgɔw fɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Sabubuya mu y’u bila ni binkanni wale na** (The reason is the lack of information about the missing people).

Here's why:

* **The provided text states:** ""A b'nafɔ ko cɛ in ya sensaba mɔbili dɔ boli mugujuguw tun be min na k'a ɲɛsin jama dɔ ma."" (They are searching for mobile phones that were used to contact the missing people.) and ""A tɔgɔ ma dɔn fɔlɔ ɲɛmɔgɔw fɛ, hali n'u b'a dɔn ka ye Uighur siya mɔgɔ ye."" (This has led to the investigation of Uighur people.)

* **The question asks:** ""Where are the missing people?""

* **The text *doesn't* state where they are.** It only describes the investigation process and the tools being used.  The absence of information about their location is the most direct and logical answer to why their whereabouts are unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kojugukɛɲɔgɔnw bɛɛ bugunnatikɛliw** (The investigation is a mistake):  The text presents the investigation as a necessary step, not a mistake.
* **B: Siganamɔgɔ siya** (Uighur people): The text *mentions* Uighur people as being investigated, but it doesn't *state* they are the missing people or where they are.
* **D: Siganamɔgɔ tɔgɔ an’a jamu** (People are hiding): While possible, the text provides no evidence to support this claim.


Therefore, **C** is the only answer that accurately reflects the information provided in the text.

The text states: ""Tolonkuncɛtolon bɛ na kɛ Ellis Park, Johannesburg kɔnɔ, dɔgɔcɛ wɛrɛ, min senfɛ Springboks ni Ɔsitirali bɛ na ɲɔgɔn sɔrɔ."" This translates to: ""The match was at Ellis Park, Johannesburg, which was a draw, where Springboks and Australia played a draw.""
"
Springboks ka ɲɔgɔnkunbɛn bina kɛ min maci nata la?,"The correct answer is **A: Ɔsitarali**.

The text states: ""Tolonkuncɛtolon bɛ na kɛ Ellis Park, Johannesburg kɔnɔ, dɔgɔcɛ wɛrɛ, min senfɛ Springboks ni Ɔsitirali bɛ na ɲɔgɔn sɔrɔ."" This translates to ""The next match was at Ellis Park, Johannesburg, where Springboks played against Australia.""
"
Ninnu jumɛn de kɛra kungo ye dugukolokɔkan-cakɛda ma ni ci senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka segin a kɛcogo ɲuman na**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What did Hali and Sharipov use to make the rotating platform spin?
* **The text states:** ""Chiao ni Sharipov y'a yira k'u tun kisira ka bɔ yɛlɛma-yɛlɛmaw ma."" which translates to ""Chiao and Sharipov used to create friction to make it spin.""
* **The text further says:** ""Gyroscope kɔnna ka tunun dugukolokɔkan-cakɛda ka ci senfɛ, cakɛda m'a kɛcogo bila."" which translates to ""The gyroscope was used to make the rotating platform spin, but it was slow.""  This tells us the gyroscope *helped* with the spinning, but not that it was the *primary method* of making it rotate initially. The friction (ka segin a kɛcogo ɲuman na) was the key.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka to a kɛcogo ɲuman na ka bɔ yɛlɛma-yɛlɛmaw ma:** This is partially correct, but doesn't fully answer *what* was used to make the platform spin.  It describes *how* they made it spin (friction), but not the initial tool.
* **B: Gyroscope kɔlɔsili:** The text indicates the gyroscope was *slow*, not powerful enough to initiate the spin.
* **C: Fililipankurun bilali baara la:** This refers to the rotating platform itself, not what made it spin.



Therefore, **D: Ka segin a kɛcogo ɲuman na** (friction) is the most accurate answer as it describes the method used to make the platform spin, as the text explains. While not explicitly stating friction as the answer, it's the closest one, because the other options are false.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun tun ye dugukolokɔkan-cakɛda ka ci ye?","The correct answer is **A: Gyroscope tununen ɲinini** (The gyroscope spins quickly).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hali n'a sɔrɔ gyroscope kɔnna ka tunun dugukolokɔkan-cakɛda ka ci senfɛ, cakɛda m'a kɛcogo bila.""  This translates to: ""Hali's gyroscope spins very fast, and it makes a sound like a whip."" This indicates the gyroscope spins rapidly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka suuruɲan kosɔbɔ ka bɔ yɛlɛma-yɛlɛmaw ma** (It makes a sound like a whip). While the passage mentions a whip-like sound, it doesn't explain *why* it makes that sound.
* **C: Dugukolokɔkan tamani bani** (It's a different kind of spinning top). The passage focuses on the gyroscope's spinning speed, not its type.
* **D: Ka fililipankurunw bila baara la** (It's a Russian invention). The passage mentions a Russian invention, but it doesn't explain *how* the gyroscope spins.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is that the gyroscope spins quickly.

Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn ko in ka te tiɲɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Sariyatali ka ɲɛsin bɔlɔlɔkankatabikulu ma tun sedonna ni ko in na.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks *who* took action.** The original text states that AOL took action to combat spam and malicious email. 
* **Option C directly states that AOL took steps to address the problem.**  The text mentions AOL's efforts to fight spam and malicious emails.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A tun welela kiri la jamana na AOL jabalaba la** (We were initially a user of AOL): This is about the speaker's initial relationship with AOL, not who addressed the problem.
* **B: Hakilina dɔ tun dilala** (The authorities intervened):  The text doesn't mention any authorities intervening. It focuses on AOL's actions.
* **D: AOL tun bɛ ka jalaki** (AOL did complain): While AOL might have complained, the text emphasizes their *action* to fight spam, not just complaining.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately reflects the information in the original text.
"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn bɛ ko nin ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko nin tun welela kiri la san 2003 la** (You joined AOL in 2003).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Who did you join AOL with?""
* **The text states:** ""Ni y'a siɲɛnfɔlɔ ye hakilina dɔ ka sɔrɔ ni san 2003 sariyatali baara walasa ka bɔlɔlɔkanbatakikulu"" (I signed up for AOL in 2003).  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL tun jalakila cili ma minw laɲini fɛ** (AOL created a user-friendly interface): This is about AOL's features, not who the user joined with.
* **B: Ko nin tun bɛ bɔlɔlɔkoɲɛnabɔla fila de kun kan** (You were a user of the internet before):  This is irrelevant to who the user joined AOL with.
* **D: AOL tun ye ko nin weleli kiri la laɲini** (AOL was the platform you used): This is about AOL being the platform, not who the user joined with.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, munni kulɔbu jumɛn tun ye Vidal ntolatan kɛ sɛsɔn sabanan na?","The correct answer is **A: Sewiye**.

The question asks *why* Vidal is the 49th player in the Barcelona squad. The text states ""Vidal ye ntolatan 49 de KƐ a ka kulubu ye"" which translates to ""Vidal is the 49th player in the club"".  It then immediately follows with ""Sewiye la"", meaning ""Specifically, Sewiye"".  Therefore, Sewiye is the reason/explanation for Vidal being the 49th player.
"
Vidal ye ntolatan joli kɛ Barisa ye?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Vidal ye ntolatan 49 de kƐ a ka kulubu ye."" which translates to ""Vidal is the 49th player in the club.""
"
Ekipu jumɛn tun bi ka ntolatan u juguyara ni maci na?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A tun be ntolatan kulu ka dunanjigiso la yani ntolatan dɔ cɛ **Karidon Bolonia** juguya la."" This translates to ""He was a key player who played for **Bologna**.""  Therefore, the team Jacques played for is Bologna.
"
Munna Jarque tun bi ka to dunanjigiso la?,"The correct answer is **A: A tun ye ladegeli kɛ** (He is a coach).

Here's why:

* **P:** The text states ""Jacque tun be ntolatan ɲɛbila ladegeli dɔ la sɔkɔma joona fɛ Coverciano Itali kɔnɔ."" This translates to ""Jacque is a coach who trains the players at Coverciano, Italy.""
* **Q:** The question asks ""What is Jacque?""
* **A:** ""A tun ye ladegeli kɛ"" translates to ""He is a coach.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: A tun ye ɲɛbila ɲɔgɔnye dɔ kɛ** (He is a player). The text clearly states he's a coach.
* **C: A tun ye ntolatan kari** (He is a referee).  The text doesn't mention anything about him being a referee.
* **D: A tun bɛ ladegeli kɛ ni Bolonia ye** (He used to be a coach at Bologna). While the text mentions he trains players for Bologna, it doesn't say he *used to* be a coach *at* Bologna.  It just says he trains them there now.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is A.
"
Munna Jakarta cakɛda min ɲɛsinnendo dugukolokɛcogoma ma ladɔniyakunafoni di?,"The correct answer is **A: Dugukoloyɛrɛɲɛsiranɲan tun te yi**.

Therefore, the buildings collapsed, and people were trapped under the rubble. Option A, ""The buildings collapsed"" is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dugukoloyɛrɛ tun ye mun kɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Dugukoloyɛrɛɲɛsiranɲan dɔn** (Earthquake magnitudes).

Here's why:

* The text states that the tsunami was triggered by an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.5.
* The question asks *what* the earthquake magnitude is.
* The text directly links the tsunami to the earthquake's magnitude.
* Option B, ""Dugukoloyɛrɛɲɛsiranɲan dɔn"" (Earthquake magnitudes), is the most accurate and direct answer to what the earthquake magnitude was.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sigida mɔgɔw la siranli** (The strong wind is...) - This is irrelevant to the question.
* **C: Ladɔniyakunafoni dɔ** (Tsunami events) - This is the *result* of the earthquake, not the earthquake itself.
* **D: 6,5 tiɲɛnikɛyɔrɔ hakɛ** (6.5 magnitude) - While true, the question asks *what* the magnitude *is*, and ""Earthquake magnitudes"" is a broader and more appropriate answer.

Ninnu jumɛn kɛra tile ni dolotɔw bɛɛ ka baraw sababu ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Yelen bɔ ta, Rossby hakɛ ani rotasiyɔn**.

Here's why:

The text states that the phenomenon (the large-scale weather patterns and the formation of Rossby waves) is caused by:

*   **Yelen bɔ ta (Coriolis force):**  The text explicitly mentions the Coriolis force as crucial for the formation of Rossby waves.
*   **Rossby hakɛ (Rossby waves):** The text directly links the formation of Rossby waves to the phenomenon.
*   **Rotasiyɔn (Rotation):** The text states that the system involves rotation.

Therefore, option D encompasses all the correct causes mentioned in the passage."
Kalo ka Rossby hakɛ be dɔn cogo jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **A: Yelen bɔ ta ani munumununi (Wind and rotation)**.

The text states: ""Kalow be ka bara sistƐmu tun be don u ka yelen bɔ ta, rotasiyɔn, ani fosi wƐrƐ.""  This translates to: ""Rossby waves are part of a system that involves wind, rotation, and force."" Therefore, wind and rotation are what cause Rossby waves.

"
"Julie Gillard ka fɔ la, waati jumɛn Ɔsitarali ka kan ka kɛ jamana kelen ye?","The correct answer is **D: Jamanadorogonikalata kɔfɛ**.

This translates to: ""Prime Minister Julia Gillard was sworn in as Prime Minister of Australia in 2010, succeeding Queen Elizabeth II.""  Therefore, she became Prime Minister when the previous Prime Minister stepped down, marking a change in government.
"

This translates to: ""The Komen Foundation's decision was because of the controversy that arose when Representative Cliff Stearns questioned the funding of Planned Parenthood, and Stearns questioned the proper use of funds for Planned Parenthood to the **Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee**, which is part of the House Energy and Commerce Committee."" 

Therefore, the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee was the body involved in questioning the funding.
"

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun muso ma Swiss muso sɔrɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Binkɛra a kan mɔgɔ 5 fɛ** (There are 5 brothers).

The text states: ""Jalakitigiw tɔgɔw ye Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar ani Vishnu Kanjar."" This lists five brothers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A bolola fɛn ntarakilenw sɔrɔ la** (They are from a neighboring country): The text doesn't specify their origin, only that they come from Switzerland.
* **B: A fagara** (They are wealthy): The text doesn't mention their financial status.
* **D: A ka jukakɔnɔ tɛgɛrɛni n’a ka bolola ɔridinatɛri tun soŋara** (They are skilled in computer and software):  The text says they are skilled in computers and software, but the question asks *where* they come from, not *what* they are skilled at.

The text explicitly states ""Nbalankɔnɔɔridinatɛri Asus Eee..."" which translates to ""The Asus Eee computer..."". The question asks what an Asus Eee is.  Therefore, the answer is ""npalankɔnɔɔridinatɛri"" (computer).
"

This translates to: ""...and it is the Japanese Association of Social Workers that has contributed 600 words to the dictionary, of which 429 are from the Japanese language.""

Therefore, the Japanese Association of Social Workers is the organization that contributed the words to the dictionary.



"
"Ka kɛnɛ ni tɛmɛsiran in ye, jɔni ye yafadeli kɛ ka ɲɛsin sɛbɛnw tununni ma?","The correct answer is **A: Sigidamɔgɔw (tile fɔlɔ)**.

This translates to something like: ""The cost of repairing the tile and the tile sealant of the dam of Obanazawa region was high because the work was done by skilled workers.""

The question asks: ""What was the reason for the high cost of the repair work?""

The passage directly states the reason: ""because the work was done by skilled workers"" which is referred to as **sigida-mɔgɔtanifilakuluw**, or tile sealant workers (skilled workers who do tile work). Therefore, **Sigidamɔgɔw (tile fɔlɔ)** is the correct answer, representing the skilled workers who performed the repair.



"
Waati juman Del Potro tu mako be ka kaman furakɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Sɛti filanan kɔnɔ** (The set of points).

The passage states: ""Del Potro tun ye se sɔrɔ sɛti filanan na..."" which translates to ""Del Potro is also a strong player in sets..."" and later ""...a mako jɔra tayi-bɛrɛki dɔ la a kɛlen kɔ ka 6-6 sɔrɔ."" meaning ""...and they played a tie-break that went to 6-6.""  This implies the tie-break happened *within* the set.

Therefore, the answer is that the tie-break happened during the **set**.
"
Tayi-bɛrɛki fɔlɔ jaabi kɛra mun ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Muray y’a jɛ sɛti fɔlɔ kɔnɔ** (Murray ye sɛti fɔlɔ kɔnɔ).

The text states: ""Murray ye sɛti fɔlɔ jɛ tayi-bɛrɛki dɔ fɛ cɛ fila munu kɛlen kɔ ku ka tɛmɛni kɛ sɛti in senfɛ."" This translates to ""Murray was the first to reach deuce in the set and then to the point where he said it was over."" This directly answers the question of who reached deuce first.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Del potro y’a jɛ a ka kamankun mandimi kɔfɛ** (Del Potro y'a jɛ a ka kamankun mandimi kɔfɛ) - This means ""Del Potro was the one who made the first mistake.""  While Del Potro did make mistakes, the question asks *who reached deuce first*.
* **C: A sebaya tara Murray fɛ sɛti filannan na** (A sebaya tara Murray fɛ sɛti filannan na) - This means ""He (someone) was watching Murray in the set.""  The text doesn't mention anyone watching.
* **D: A sebaya tara Del Potro fɛ sɛti filannan na** (A sebaya tara Del Potro fɛ sɛti filannan na) - This means ""He (someone) was watching Del Potro in the set.""  The text doesn't mention anyone watching.

"I n’a fɔ a fora tɛmɛsira kɔnɔ cogo min, jɔnin de tun gɛrɛla banabaatɔ la?","The correct answer is **B: Dɛmɛsinniw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maraba y'a kan to tuguni, """"bii kalanso dɛnmisɛnni kɔrɔbalen dɔw yera ka gɛrɛ banabaatɔ in na."""" ""  This translates to: ""Maraba then spoke, """"The big Dɛmɛsinniw are the ones who help the people."""" ""

Therefore, the question ""I n’a fɔ a fora tɛmɛsira kɔnɔ cogo min, jɔnin de tun gɛrɛla banabaatɔ la?"" (Who did Perry say are the ones who help the people?) is answered by **Dɛmɛsinniw**.

And he still finds it (the situation) as a complete mess.""  The phrase ""baarasira be ka baara ka kɛ ka cogo la"" means ""it is still a complete mess"" or ""it is chaotic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fɛrɛw be ka kɛ walasa ka jama ka lakana sabati.** (It's a way to earn money to spend on weekends.) While mentioned earlier, it's not the *reason* the speaker finds the situation chaotic.
* **C: U be se ka gɛlɛya in kunbɛn.** (It is possible to make a living.) This is stated directly by Perry, but the response focuses on the *current* state of affairs, not just possibility.
* **D: Nin ko in ka gɛlɛn.** (It is possible.) This is a general statement and doesn't explain *why* the situation is chaotic.

The text states: ""Waatijan ka kɔn Daily Show ni The Colbert Report ɲɛ..."" which translates to ""Since the 1988s, satire has been seen on Daily Show and The Colbert Report...""  Therefore, the Daily Show is mentioned as one of the programs that featured satire on UW (presumably referring to a platform or news outlet).

Here's why:

The passage describes The Onion's satirical news articles and their podcast, which parodies real news and current events. Satire is a form of humor that uses irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.

The passage mentions:

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tun be ka kɔlɔsi polisiw fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Trafalgar Square**.

The text states: ""Taalen 11 h 29 waati , lajƐ taarase fɔ Whitehall kan, ka tƐmƐ Trafalgar Square fƐ..."" which translates to ""At 11:29, the procession moved from Whitehall to Trafalgar Square..."".

Therefore, Trafalgar Square is where the procession stopped.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...Dr. Ehud Ur, kɛnɛya karamɔkɔ Dalhousie sanfɛ kalanso la Halifax, Nova Scotia ani Kanada sukɔrɔbana jɛkulu tɔn kɛnɛyako ni ɲinini cakɛda ɲɛmoko ye lasɔnni kɛ ka yira ko ɲininiw ma ta yɔrɔ jan fɔlɔ.

* This directly translates to: ""...Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia and a leading Canadian diabetes researcher, has been studying the mechanisms by which people develop diabetes, **and the role of the gut microbiota in glucose metabolism and the development of type 1 diabetes.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sukarobana tun bɛ ɲinɛ minnu na fɔlɔ a tɛ olu la tun:** (Glucose is a very important component that is present) - While glucose is important, this isn't the main focus of what Dr. Ur studies.
* **C: A dalen b’a la ko jaabiw bɛ na se ka wolo bana in furakɛlila ka ban:** (He has shown that the microbiota can help people heal) - The text focuses on the *role* of the microbiota, not specifically on its healing abilities.
* **D: Sukarobana tun tɛ ɲina minnu na, a bɛ olu la sisan:** (Glucose is a very important component, it is present and it is a component) - This is redundant and doesn't capture the core of Dr. Ur's research.

* This translates to: ""Dr. Ehud Ur... has conducted research on the potential of sugar to be used as a substitute for insulin, **and has studied the effects of sugar on the blood of people with type 1 diabetes.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: N’a bɛ se kɛnɛya (He is a researcher):** While true, the question asks *what he has done*, not *what he is*.
* **C: Dɔnnibajolen wɛrɛw hakilina ka ɲɛsin bana in kɛnɛyali ma (His research focuses on the effects of sugar on the body):** This is a bit too broad. The passage specifically mentions the effects on people with *type 1 diabetes*.
* **D: Bana tɛ ɲina minnu na n’olu kɛnalen bɛ na to (People with diabetes are not allowed to eat sugar):**  This is incorrect and not supported by the passage. The research is *about* the effects of sugar on people with diabetes.

Ninnu laseli jumɛnw tɛ CG4684 pankurun ka kasara bugunnatigɛ tigitigi?,"The correct answer is **C: Pankurun ye a lajɛ ka jigin siyɛn saba sani kasara in ka kɛ**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Twin Otter tun ye a lajƐ ka jigin Kokoda kunun ni pankurun CG4684 ka pankurun PNG ye, ɲa a tun ye a sɔrɔ a tiɲƐ siyƐn kelen."" This translates to ""The Twin Otter is a large aircraft used in the Kokoda route and CG4684 and PNG aircraft, and it is used to transport goods.""
* **The text further explains:** ""Kasara in kƐyɔrɔ yera bii wa yen lasɔrɔ ka gƐlƐn o cogoya kɔsɔn polosi fila bilara ka jigin kungokolo kɔnɔ yasa ka taa a yɔrɔw ani ka mɔgɔnilamaw ɲinni. ɲinninliw senkɔrɔmacƐra ni o waatibiwibasa kelen o ɲɔ ngon ye minw kƐra sababu ye ka jiginni in mafɔ.""  This means ""The aircraft is used to transport various goods, including medicine, police equipment, and essential supplies to remote areas and people in need. The lack of infrastructure and the difficulty of transportation are the main reasons for the aircraft's importance.""

Therefore, the aircraft's role is to transport a variety of goods. Option C, ""Pankurun ye a lajɛ ka jigin siyɛn saba sani kasara in ka kɛ"" (The aircraft is a large aircraft used in various goods transport), accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pankurun in tun ma se ka jigin ka da waati kan** (The aircraft is mainly used for water transport) - The text clearly states it's for goods transport, not water transport.
* **B: Pankurun ye a lajɛ ka jigin siyɛn saba sani kasara in ka kɛ** (The aircraft is a large aircraft used in various goods transport) - While it *is* a large aircraft used for transporting goods, the text specifies a *variety* of goods, not just ""various goods transport."" Option C is a more precise answer.
* **D: The question doesn't provide any option D**"
Sababu jumɛn ye CG4684 pankurun jiginni mafɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Jiginni yɔrɔ tun lasɔrɔ ka gɛlɛn**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Miniti tan ɲɔgɔn sani a ka jigin dugu ma a gƐrƐ ko filanan la, a tunura.

This translates to: ""After a few days, the plane was repaired. The cause was that the propeller was damaged by a collision with a bird, and it was replaced with a new propeller. The later investigation revealed that the reason for the plane's failure was the damage to the propeller.""

Therefore, the reason the CG4684 plane failed was **damage to the propeller due to a collision with a bird.** Option A accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pankurun wɛrɛw caman tun bila la CG4684 pankurun ɲɛfɛ** (The plane was not painted like the CG4684 plane): This is irrelevant to the reason for the failure.
* **C: Pankurun in bila la taa Kokoda sira kan** (The plane was flying over the Kokoda range):  While the plane was over the Kokoda range, that's not the cause of the failure.
* **D: Waati cogoyaw tun maɲi** (There was a lot of water): This is not mentioned in the text.

"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, ninnu laseli minnu bɛ kuma Franciszek Kowal ka ko tɛmɛnenw baro kan jumɛn kelen ye tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **D: A madimina waati min a tun y'a lajɛ ka fiɲɛbɔda dɔ kari**

Here's why:

The passage states that Franciszek Ko ten talks about ""sofiɲɛbiladaw"" (a type of plant) and how its roots are used to make a medicine. The text specifically mentions that the roots are used as a ""bɔli daminɛ sofiɲɛbɔda fɛ"" (a powerful remedy).

Option D accurately reflects this: ""A madimina waati min a tun y'a lajɛ ka fiɲɛbɔda dɔ kari"" translates to ""His root is used to make a powerful remedy.""  It directly connects the plant's root to its medicinal properties, as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A sera ka sofiɲɛbilada dɔ kari** (He is talking about the plant itself): While true, it's too general. The passage emphasizes the importance of the *roots* for medicinal purposes.
* **B: A ma madimin hali fitini** (He is a great person of action): This is a personal attribute of Franciszek Ko ten and not directly mentioned in the passage.
* **C: A ye sigilan dɔ kari waati min na a tun bɛka a lajɛ ka bɔ** (He is a sign/symbol of the plant, which is used to make medicine): The passage doesn't describe Franciszek Ko ten as a symbol or sign of the plant.

Therefore, only option D correctly summarizes the core idea of the passage as it relates to Franciszek Ko ten's discussion.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ŋɛɲininikɛlaw ka bɔ National Hurricane Center ko Danielle bɛ bonya ka kɛ funufunu ye Araba don."" (The National Hurricane Center said Danielle was heading towards the Caribbean.)
* The question asks *where* Danielle was headed.
* Option B directly addresses this by stating the location according to the National Hurricane Center.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sigi kɛlen do ko funufunu in bɛna bonya** (The storm was 40 miles away) - While true, this doesn't answer *where* it was going.
* **C: Sanfiɲɛ in ni dugukolo ka na cɛ ka jan kojugu** (The storm was approaching the coast and people were preparing) - This talks about preparations, not the destination.
* **D: Sanfiɲɛ in sɔrɔ yɔrɔ ni Miami cɛ ka jan kojugu** (The storm was approaching Miami and people were preparing) - This is partially true, but option B provides a more specific location according to the National Hurricane Center.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and direct answer to the question.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ŋɛɲininikɛlaw ka bɔ National Hurricane Center ko Danielle bɛ bonya ka kɛ funufunu ye Araba don.""  This translates to: ""According to the National Hurricane Center, Danielle formed in the Atlantic Ocean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A kɔlɔlɔ Karayibu kan na la, o ma dɔn (It went to the Caribbean, but it didn't).** The text doesn't say it *went* to the Caribbean. It states it was *forecast* to potentially go to the Caribbean.
* **C: A bɛ se ka bonya ka kɛ funufunu ye (It was said to be a strong storm).** While Danielle *was* a strong storm, the question asks *where it formed*.
* **D: A ka surun dugukolo ka na la (It hit land).** The text doesn't say it made landfall. It only mentions a forecast for potential impact.

Here's why:

The text states that Dr. Lee is concerned about the spread of avian influenza (A(H5N1)) in Turkey.  The text also says that the virus can infect birds and that humans can get infected if they come into contact with infected bird droppings or fluids. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A kaɲi ka mɔgɔ dɔnni faga (It's just a common flu):** Avian influenza is *not* a common flu. It's a serious and potentially deadly respiratory illness.
* **B: Taamasiɲɛ in kan ka to dogo la (The virus is only in certain regions):** The text implies the concern is widespread, not limited to specific regions.
* **D: Denmisenw kan ka taamasiɲɛw ye (The disease is a type of termite):** This is completely unrelated to the text!

The text states: ""A jateminɛnna ko Fiyɛnkolonba Tyfɔn be ka ɲɛsin Siniwa jamana ma km 77 tannikele lɛrɛ la."" This translates to: ""The central point of the Typhoon was 77 kilometers to the east of the Fujian province.""

Therefore, the distance is 77 kilometers.

The question asks what George W. Bush met with in Asia. The text states: ""Bush kumana jama dɔ fɛ jago yiriwali kan Asia"" which translates to ""Bush met with various leaders in Asia.""

Therefore, the answer is ""Jama dɔ"" (various leaders).
"
Waati jumɛn jamanaɲɛmɔgɔ kuma na jago yiriwali kan Asia?,"The correct answer is **D: A ka dɔgɔkun kelen taama sen fɛ Asia** (He gave a speech to the people of Asia).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bush kumana jama dɔ fɛ jago yiriwali kan Asia"" which translates to ""Bush gave a speech to the people of Asia."" Option D directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A sen le Singapɔre** (He was in Singapore): While the event took place in Singapore, the question asks *what* he did, not *where* he was.
*   **B: Ni Wong Kan Seng ye** (It was Wong Kan Seng): Wong Kan Seng is a Singaporean minister who *met* with Bush, but the core action described is Bush giving a speech.
*   **C: Ka tugu a ka furancɛ kalata ciliw la** (Because he received a letter from France): The letter from France is mentioned as the reason for the meeting with Wong Kan Seng, but it doesn't describe what Bush did to the people of Asia.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, ninnu jumɛn kelen ye ɲɛmɔgɔw ka kuntilena ba ye?","The correct answer is **C: Ka tɛrɛnwotoro wɛrɛw den 1 300 sɔrɔ**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""If you had to choose one, which one do you want to use?""

The initial text states: ""Tirɛnwotorow 300 fara la 1.300 kan walasa ka jamakafoba nɔgɔya."" This translates to ""There are 300 of one type and 1300 of another type available.""

Therefore, the choice is between 300 and 1300. Option C directly states the choice of 1300. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:**  ""Ka tɛrɛnwotoro wɛrɛw san ɲinan san Marisikalo waati"" - This translates to ""The type of tire that is available for the market"". It's not a choice of quantity.
*   **B:** ""Ka tɛrɛnwotoro a bɛɛ lajɛlen faralen ɲɔkɔn ka den 300 sɔrɔ"" - This translates to ""The type of tire that has a quantity of 300"".  It's not a choice of quantity.
*   **D:** ""Ka tɛrɛnwotorow ka jamakafoba ko ban"" - This translates to ""The tires that are in the same quantity"".  It's not a choice of quantity.



"
Cikan jumɛn fɔra maraɲɛmaw fɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: U y'a ɲaniya ka tɛrɛnwotoro wɛrɛw den 1,300 jikɔrɔmatonto.**

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** ""Tirɛnwotorow 300 fara la 1.300 kan walasa ka jamakafoba nɔgɔya.""  This translates to: ""There are 300 francs and 1,300 (units of something - assumed to be the same unit as the francs) that are distributed among the families.""
* **The question asks:** ""Cikan jumɛn fɔra maraɲɛmaw fɛ?"" which means ""How many families are there?""
* **The answer (C) directly reflects the total number of units distributed, which corresponds to the total number of families in this context.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""U y'a ɲaniya ka tɛrɛnwotoro wɛrɛw den 300 san"" - This translates to ""There is a certain number of units equal to 300."" This is just one part of the distribution, not the total number of families.
* **B:** ""U ɲɛsin ne don ni sɛbɛ ye tɛrɛnwotoro ko gɛlɛya nɔgɔyali ma"" - This translates to ""It is not known how many units each family receives."" This is about the distribution per family, not the total number of families.
* **D:** ""Jamakafoba gɛlɛya bɛna nɔgɔya sani Marisikalo cɛ"" - This translates to ""The families are in the same market."" This is irrelevant to the question of how many families there are.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kunnafoni jumɛn dɔnnen do?","The correct answer is **D: Kunnafoni y'a sɛbɛntiya ko binkani in bɛna juguya kosɔbɛ**.

Here's the breakdown of the question and answer:

* **P (Question):** ""A ko, """"Keguya foyi t'a yira k'a fɔ tigitigi sigi kɛra ni binkani dɔ ye. O bɛ na ta, bagabagali dɔgɔya o dɔgɔya, o kɔrɔ tɛ bagabagaliw banna pewu.""""""  This translates roughly to: ""Listen, the white person (Keguya) is looking at the small, round (tigitigi) grains and the people. He said, 'Those people are strong, they've made the grains rise up.'""

* **Q (Question):** ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kunnafoni jumɛn dɔnnen do?"" This translates to: ""What is the purpose of the grain that the white person has made the people work for?""

* **A (Option D):** ""Kunnafoni y'a sɛbɛntiya ko binkani in bɛna juguya kosɔbɛ."" This translates to: ""The grains are used for the work that the people have to do.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A (Option A):** ""Bagabagali kɛli hakɛ jigina"" - ""The people are just working hard."" This doesn't address the *purpose* of the grains.
* **B (Option B):** ""Bagabagali foyi tɛ yen bilen"" - ""The white people are their own masters.""  This is unrelated to the grains and the work.
* **C (Option C):** ""Sigi kɛlen do binkani dɔ kan"" - ""The grains are the same as the people."" This is nonsensical.

**Therefore, option D correctly answers the question by stating that the grains are used for the work the people are doing.** The white person made the grains rise up, implying the people are working to make them grow or harvest them. The question asks the purpose of this work.
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn ka ɲɛsin lagosiliw ma tɛ tiɲɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Kalafiliw kɛ baliya ka mɛn tun ye lagosiliw lawili.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...minni dɔw tun kakan ka kabini san kɛ2011."" This translates to ""...the population of the cities was increasing and they were being linked to the cities in 2011.""

This indicates that the cities (Kalafiliko) were linked to the cities (lagosiliw) and their populations were growing. Option B directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ɲɛmɔgɔya so jɛkulu tun kɛra jaabi ye lagosiliw ma** (The population of the cities was being linked to the cities): While partially true, it doesn't explain *how* the cities were linked.
* **C: Lagosilaw ye CEP kɔrɔ k'a baarabila laɲini kɛ k'a gɛlɛya** (Cities and CEPs were linked by a very beautiful and efficient connection): The text doesn't mention a ""beautiful and efficient connection.""
* **D: Lagosiliw tun ka farin tuma dɔw la** (Cities began to have a very large number of people):  While the text mentions population increase, it doesn't say cities *began* to have a large number of people.

Therefore, option B is the only one that accurately reflects the information presented in the text.
"
Jɔn tun y’a laɲini ko CEP kɔrɔ ka baara bila?,"The correct answer is **A: Martelly**.

The text states: ""Martelly ka CEP duurunan ye san naani kɔnɔ."" which translates to ""Martelly's CEP is the one that is being sought."" This directly answers the question of who is seeking the CEP.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni kumasen in ye, USA Jimnastiki ma dɛmɛdo fɛn jumɛn ma Nassar ka dantɛmɛ wale min kɛra farikoloɲɛnajɛlaw la kɔfɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Falenniw minw tun kan ka kɛ jɛkulu in kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the USA Gymnastics and USOC's response to the Larry Nassar scandal was inadequate. It describes their actions as prioritizing the sport and protecting gymnasts over reporting Nassar's abuse.  The phrase ""falenniw minw tun kan ka kɛ jɛkulu in kɔnɔ"" (which translates to ""a failure to take the situation seriously"") best captures this inadequate response and the failure to address the abuse properly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jɔyɔrɔ tanɲa (Joyful celebration):** This is the opposite of what the passage describes. The passage is about a scandal and failure.
* **B: Tanɲɛ dɔ dilani (A serious situation):** While the situation was serious, this option doesn't address *how* USA Gymnastics and USOC handled the situation – which is the core of the question.
* **D: Ɲinnin kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen (A series of failures):** While it could be argued that there were multiple failures, option C is more precise in describing the root cause of the problem - the lack of seriousness and proper action.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni kumasen in ye, USA Jimnastiki ani Ameriki Komite Olympik ka laɲini ba ye mun ye?","The correct answer is **D: Sigida lakana waleyaw carili farikolo ɲanajɛlaw ye** (Demand for accountability for abuse of power).

Here's why:

The text clearly states that the USOC and USA Gymnastics have faced criticism for **not holding those responsible for the abuse accountable**. The criticism stems from the Larry Nassar case, where he abused gymnasts, and the perception that the organizations failed to protect them and address the issue effectively. The demand for accountability is a central theme of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka tiɲɛ bange Larry Nassa damatɛmɛwale in kan** (The fact that Larry Nassar abused gymnasts): While true, this is a *part* of the problem, not the overall criticism of the organizations themselves.
* **B: Jɔyɔrɔ tanɲɛ** (Public outcry): Public outcry *exists*, but the passage focuses on the organizations' inaction and failure to respond appropriately.
* **C: Sɛgɛsɛli kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen taɲɛ** (Disciplinary actions): The passage implies a *lack* of sufficient disciplinary actions, not that they have been adequately taken.

The passage states: ""Dugujukɔrɔfɛn ɲinini lagosili kɛ kɔkɔjikurun Avenger tun be aka sira fɛ ka taa Puerto Princesa Palawan."" This translates to ""The American aircraft carrier group, after traveling, went to Puerto Princesa Palawan.""

Therefore, the aircraft carrier group went to Palawan.

Ninnu jumɛn kelen tiɲɛn ye ka ɲɛsin kɔkɔjikurun in ma min fɔra tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: A tun bɛ ka taa Puerto Princesa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dugujukɔrɔfɛn ɲinini lagosili kɛ kɔkɔjikurun Avenger tun be aka sira fɛ ka taa Puerto Princesa Palawan."" This translates to ""The US aircraft carrier group, led by the Avenger, flew and arrived in Puerto Princesa, Palawan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A dagalen do Palawani:**  ""Dagalen do Palawani"" means ""departed from Palawan."" The passage says they *arrived* in Puerto Princesa, not departed from Palawan.
* **C: Dugujukɔrɔfɛnw ɲinini kɔkɔjikurun do:** This means ""the US aircraft carrier group."" While true, the question asks *where* they arrived.
* **D: A tun kalifala Ameriki Kɔkɔjikɛlɛbolo wolonfilanan ma:** This means ""It departed from the US aircraft carrier group."" The passage says they *arrived* in Puerto Princesa.



"
Jɔn ye tun ye kuma lase ka ɲɛsin Ameriki kɛlɛdenw ma?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The text states that the phone call was between Donald Trump (America) and Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkey). The question asks who the phone call was with regarding America. Therefore, the answer is Donald Trump.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni kumasen nin ye, ninnu jamana jumɛn kelen k'a bɛ jɔ ni kɛlɛ denw minɛninw ladonni ye?","The correct answer is **D: Turki**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Turki bena a jɔ fɛnɛ ni ISIS ka kƐlƐden minɛlenw la donni ye minw ni erɔpu jamanaw ye I ban lasegifaso la...""  This translates to ""...Turkey has been fighting alongside ISIS and against European countries and international coalitions...""

Therefore, according to the text, Turkey is the one fighting alongside ISIS and against European countries.
"
Mun de jateminɛna ka kɛ kasara in nɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Fitinɛkɔlɔlɔ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pankurunkasara kɛra kuluma yɔrɔ dɔ sanfɛ, min jateminɛna ka kɛ futinɛkɔlɔlɔ ye."" This translates to: ""The reason for the destruction of the city was the burning of the buildings, which was due to fire.""  

Therefore, ""fitinɛkɔlɔlɔ"" (fire) is the reason for the destruction.
"
Yala kasara tun kɛra yɔrɔ sugu jumɛn na?,"The correct answer is **A: Juguya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pankurunkasara kɛra kuluma yɔrɔ dɔ sanfɛ, min jateminɛna ka kɛ futinɛkɔlɔlɔ ye."" This translates to: ""The most common cause of lakanadɛmɛjɛkulu is that it is caused by a lack of vitamins.""  

The question asks: ""What is the most common cause of lakanadɛmɛjɛkulu?""  

The text directly answers this question by stating the lack of vitamins is the cause. ""Juguya"" translates to ""vitamins"". Therefore, the correct answer is Juguya.
"

* The text also mentions that many people rely on these networks for news, which is why they are a key part of people's daily lives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jijɔyɔrɔniw dilanni (Traditional leaders):** While traditional leaders might be a source of information, the text focuses more on the rise of social networks.
* **C: Ntɛbɛnnunjanw cayali (Digital platforms):** This is too broad. While social networks *are* digital platforms, the text specifically highlights the importance of social networks.
* **D: Fɛnmisɛnnisiyɔrɔw cayali (Scientists):** Scientists might contribute to information, but the text doesn't emphasize their role as a primary source of information in the way it emphasizes social networks.



"
Barazi dilanni ye nɔ bila ninnu jumɛn de la kudayi?,"The correct answer is **A: Cɛncɛntonw (Journalists)**.

The text states: ""Nafan tun bɛ in badagoloɲama in na walasa ka cɛncɛnton ni jijɔyɔrɔniw dilan, minw tun ye fɛnmisɛnnisiyɔrɔw ye.""  This translates to: ""Later, we were involved in journalism and news reporters of that time, who were freelance journalists.""

Therefore, the question ""Barazi dilanni ye nɔ bila ninnu jumɛn de la kudayi?"" (What were they mainly doing at that time?) is answered by the fact that they were journalists.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn tun ye Ameriki jamana kunnafoni binkanniwalew kan minnu bɛ se ka kɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Somali jatigɛ walekɛlaw**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""... Etats Unis ko a ye kunafoni in sɔrɔ gundomayɔrɔ dɔ la min y'a kɛrɛn-kɛrɛn fo ko mugujugukɛlɛminɛw bɛ na ci yɔrɔjɔnjɔnniw ma Etiyopi ni Kɛniya jamanaw kɔnɔ.""  This translates to: ""...The United States is a partner in providing humanitarian assistance to the people who are fleeing from famine in Ethiopia and Kenya.""  

The sentence *directly* links the US assistance to the Somali refugees. Therefore, the Somali refugees are the ones receiving the humanitarian aid.
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn be jatigɛwale kɛlaw ka binkanni labɛnni ko ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka mugujuguw ci dugu nafamanyɔrɔw la jamana fila kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the cause of the conflict between the Somali and Kenyan communities. The passage states: ""Lameriki jamana lasigiso min bɛ Nayirobi, Kɛniya kɔnɔ ye lasɔmini kɛ ko """" jatigɛwalekɛraw minnu bɛ Somali """" bɛ yɛrɛfagasumugujugu labɛnna ka ɲɛsin Kɛniya ni Etiyopi jamanaw ma."" This translates to: ""The conflict in Nairobi, Kenya, is triggered by the ""Somali"" communities' clashes which affect the territories of Kenya and Ethiopia.""

The passage then explains that the United States is involved in efforts to reduce this conflict. The phrase ""ka ɲɛsin Kɛniya ni Etiyopi jamanaw ma"" (affect the territories of Kenya and Ethiopia) suggests the conflict exists *between* communities in those territories.  The conflict is related to movement *across* borders (""jamana fila kɔnɔ"" - border regions/areas). Therefore, the clash originates from tensions in the border regions.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka mugujuguw ci dugu nafamanyɔrɔw la jamana kelen kɔnɔ** (Caused by tensions in the coastal regions): The passage focuses on conflict affecting Kenya and Ethiopia, not specifically the coastal regions.
* **B: Ka mugujuguw ci jamana fila kɔnɔ** (Caused by tensions in border regions): While close, option C is more precise because the phrase ""jamana fila kɔnɔ"" (border regions) refers to the area where the conflict happens, and option C adds the concept of communities clashing *within* those border regions.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the given text.
"
"Mɔgɔ ninnu na, jɔn tɛ soronadonbagaw ye?","The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

The text states: ""Ni y'a dɔgɔkun damadɔ ye, kunnafoni jɛnsɛnnen do kunnafonidila Makis Triantafylopoulos fɛ aka Teleso jɛmukan lakodɔnnenba la, Wasaden ni sariyatigi **Petros Mantouvalos** labɔra aka baara la ka da a kan aka baarayɔrɔ mɔgɔ dɔw sen yeera surafɛn ni yuruguyurugu la.""

This translates to: ""And in the end, the prosecutor Makis Triantafylopoulos, with the assistance of Teleso, a lawyer, and the prosecutor **Petros Mantouvalos** took over the investigation of the charges against the people who were involved in the attack and the vandalism.""
"
Ninnu jama kulu jumɛn ma kofɔ minnu sen bɛ kunmasuliko la min kɛra Gɛrɛki sariyatigɛjɛkulu la?,"The correct answer is **B: Kiiritigɛlaw**.

The text states: ""...Ola kunmasuliko ba dɔ kɛra Gɛrɛsi jamana sariyatigɛjƐkulu la ni sariyatan kow kofɔli ye kiiritigɛlaw ye...""

This translates to: ""...They were accused by the Greek judicial system and the relevant courts of... **serious offenses**...""

Therefore, ""kiiritigɛlaw"" (serious offenses) is the correct answer.
"
Cɛluda joli tununa Ɛndujamana fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: 11**.

The passage states: ""11 ani woroni 2 Camacɛ kulu gosilikɛlaw..."" which translates to ""11 years old and 2 Camacɛ (a type of measurement) in the stadium..."".  This refers to the age at which Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid started playing together in India.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, bere ntolan bɛɛ la cɛlu sɔrɔlen tu ye joli ye?","The correct answer is **B: Boli 36**.

The question asks ""What is the total number of runs scored by the team?"" The passage states: ""India dron ye boli 36 kɛ ka cɛluda 7 labila ka bere ndolan in kun cɛ.""  This translates to ""India's team scored 36 runs and 7 wickets fell in the remaining overs.""  Therefore, the total number of runs scored is 36.
"
Ninnu jumɛn tun tɛ Adam Cuerden ka jigilatigɛ kun ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Siti ka sariya kura min talikɛ cɛnimusoya fɛnw**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Filanan, k'a kɛ inafɔ a tun be k'anw lamɛ, a ka seko nidɔngɔ kofɔli kɔ.""  This translates to ""In fact, it is also a land of gentle hills, where sheep graze and the fertile soil is used for growing crops.""
*  The question asks what Adam Cuerden is known for in terms of agriculture.
* Option A (""Siti ka sariya kura min talikɛ cɛnimusoya fɛnw"" - ""A land of gentle hills where sheep graze and fertile soil is used for growing crops"") directly reflects this description.
* Options B, C, and D are not mentioned in the provided text.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, mun de jɔsira ka bɔ siti kan?","The correct answer is **C: Politiki sariyasun sɛbɛn (Political activism)**.

Here's why:

* The text describes someone involved in ""jigilatigɛ yira labɔliko nunuw na aka kuma dɔ la Wikimews"" (writing articles and contributing to Wikipedia) and advocating for Wales' independence (""Ale [Wales] ye galɔn tigɛ anw ma kabini a daminɛ"").
* The text mentions ""sariyako kun na"" (activism) and ""k'anw lamɛ"" (advocacy).
* The final sentence talks about reaching ""miliyɔn caman jatigi"" (millions of people) and mobilizing support, which are hallmarks of political activism.

Therefore, the most fitting option is **C: Politiki sariyasun sɛbɛn (Political activism)**.  The other options don't capture the essence of the described activities.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, ninnu jumɛn Amir Khan tɛ dɛmɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Musow hakilinaw (Boxing skills)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Amir Khan, san 2004 Olɛnpik Ɲɛnajɛ warijɛ jɔnjɔn tabaa, ne yɛrɛ kɔnɔ, n hakilila musow mankan ka kɛlɛ kɛ."" This translates to: ""Amir Khan, a medal winner at the 2004 Olympics, has been working hard and has excellent boxing skills."" 

Therefore, his boxing skills are what led to his success and recognition.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Amir Khan bɛna ninnu jumɛn dɛmɛ hali n’a hakilina tɛ?","The correct answer is **B: A ɲɔgɔndanɲɔgɔnw ka bɔ 2004 Olɛnpiki la**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Amir Khan, san 2004 Olɛnpik Ɲɛnajɛ warijɛ jɔnjɔn tabaa, ne yɛrɛ kɔnɔ..."" which translates to ""Amir Khan, a gold medalist in the 2004 Olympics, was...""  Therefore, his Olympic success is directly linked to the 2004 Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Muso kɛlɛkɛlaw (Boxing skills):** While boxing skills are important, the question asks *when* he achieved recognition for those skills.  The text highlights the 2004 Olympics as the key moment.
* **C: 2012 Olɛnpik (2012 Olympics):** The text mentions the 2004 Olympics, not the 2012 Olympics.
* **D: Warijɛ medayitigi tɔw (Won a medal):** While he won a medal, the question asks about the specific event where he became known for his skills - the 2004 Olympics.



"
Peter Lenz sara tuma jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **B: A binnen kɔ ka bɔ a ka moto kan** (He was born into a family that owned a car).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Peter Lenz, san 13 den mɔtɔtulonkɛra dɔ, saara a sen yeni kɔ kasara dɔ la Indianapolis Motor Speedway kan."" (Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old racer, had been coming to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since he was young.)
* It further mentions: ""A ka labɛn senfɛ Lenz bɔra a ka mɔtɔ kan ka bin, ni ka gosi a tulonkɛɲɔgɔn Xavier Zayat fɛ."" (It was said that Lenz was born into a family that owned a car, and that his mentor was Xavier Zayat.)

Option B directly reflects this information. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ka labɛn senfɛ** (It was said...) - This is a general statement and doesn't specify *what* was said.
* **C: Dɔgɔtɔrɔsola** (Doctor) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Tuma min na a ni sirakankasarakɛnɛyamaakulu tun do** (People and his mentor...) - While Xavier Zayat is mentioned as a mentor, the passage focuses on Lenz's family owning a car."
Xavier Zayat ye jɔn ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Tulonkɛɲɔgɔn wɛrɛ**.

The text states: ""O yɔrɔni bɛɛ, sirakankasarakɛnɛyamaakulu dɔ ye dɛmɛ don a ma ka taa dɔkɔtɔrɔsodeni dɔ la a saara yɔrɔ minna kɔfɛ."" This translates to: ""His friends, the racing team members, were all the people who were supposed to be in the doctor's room after the race.""  Therefore, Xavier Zayat is a racing team member.

Cogoya jumɛn na panikɛla hamitɔ bɛ se ka faamuyali sɔrɔ pankuru kɔnɔna marise cogo la?,"The correct answer is **C: Ni taamakɛla bɛ hami bolifɛn sugu bɛɛ kɔnɔdonni na.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** How do babies prevent their skin from being damaged by sunlight?
* **The text states:** ""Famuyalila pankuru be marise cogomina ani min be kɛ pani kɔnɔ be sek'u dɛmɛ ka siranya kɛlɛ min sigileno dɔnibaliya kan walima yɛrɛminɛn baliya.""  This translates to: ""Applying sunscreen protects the skin from harmful rays that can cause sunburn and skin damage.""
* **The options relate to baby skincare:**
    * **A:** This talks about the general benefits of sunscreen.
    * **B:** This suggests using baby powder, which isn't a primary sun protection method.
    * **C:** This directly addresses sun protection for babies.  Babies have very delicate skin and aren't able to apply sunscreen themselves, so parents need to do it for them.  The text implies that parents apply sunscreen to babies' skin.
    * **D:** This is about using a specific type of lotion and isn't directly related to sun protection or babies.

Therefore, option C is the only one that logically answers how babies are protected from sunlight's damage, given the text's emphasis on sunscreen application.



"
"Ka da ni tɛmɛsira in kan, paseko dɔnni bɛ taamakɛla o bɛ mun de laban kɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Ka barayɔrɔ caman ka pasew sanga ɲɔgɔnna.**

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks why people are increasingly using the internet to share information and news.
* **The passage (P)** states that the internet is being used to share information and news, including opinions and perspectives, and that this is happening rapidly.  It highlights that people are increasingly using this method of sharing information.
* **Option C** directly addresses this by saying that people are using the internet to share their perspectives and opinions (which aligns with the passage mentioning ""opinions and perspectives"" being shared).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka taama barayɔrɔ caman ka fɛn di taw ɲini** (Because people are increasingly interested in news). While related, the passage focuses on *sharing* information, not just being interested in it.
* **B: Ka marali kɛ ka bila pankuruso ka baarakɛyɔrɔ la** (Because it is easy to post opinions and perspectives).  While posting is part of it, the passage emphasizes the increasing *use* of the internet for sharing, not solely the ease of posting.
* **D: Ka pankuruso ka baarakɛyɔrɔ ka siti lajɛ** (Because opinions and perspectives exist online). This is a tautology; the passage already states that opinions and perspectives are being shared online.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the passage and the question."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dugutaalaw k’an ka mun de kɛ walasa ka pankuru pase bɛ la daduman sɔrɔ?","The correct answer is **C: K’a mara bila pankuru cakɛda ka siti ɛntɛrinɛti kan.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the reason why the use of pornography is increasing among teenagers?
* **The text states:**  ""...piri baw camaw be seka kɛ woli kelen kɔnɔ kunafonisow camaw la ani ɲininli jaabi sumani ye ɲɔgɔna be sara kaɲɛ ani ka pankuruso baarakɛyɔrɔ ka ɛntɛrɛnɛti siti lajɛ fɛnɛ yani marali cɛ kabila.""  (Translation: ""...increasingly, young people are using the internet to access pornography, which is considered a significant issue and a cause for concern among parents and society."")

Option C directly reflects this statement: ""The increase in pornography is due to its availability on the internet.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka pankuruso ka baarakɛyɔrɔ ka siti lajɛ** (Pornography is available on the internet) - This is a true statement *but it doesn't explain *why* it's increasing.*
* **B: Ka kunafonisow ka pasew sanga ɲɔgɔn ma** (Parents are not able to control this situation) -  While parental control is a concern, the text doesn't explicitly state this as the *reason* for the increase.
* **D: K’a mara bila duguta ko ɲɛnabɔbaga dɔ ye** (It is due to the lack of education among children) - The text doesn't mention a lack of education as the primary reason.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the provided text.



"
Tuma jumɛn tɔɲɔgɔn bɛ jaguya ka taa fɛn di ta nɔfɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Nin fɛnw bɛ ka ci inafɔ minɛn tɔgɔ sɛbɛnnen**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sira dɔw kan, cili baarakɛyɔrɔw ka pankuruw b'u yɛrɛw bolo, nka nin sira wɛrɛ ani izini fitiniw fɛ, kunbalan kun beyi. Nin u kun ye fɛnw ci dɔnita pankuru fɛ, sira dɔw fɛ a kun be seka tile camaw ta ka se jigili ma ani duwani. **Sira kelen min beyi ka cili teliya kun ye ka ci inafɔ minɛn tɔgɔ sɛbɛnlen.** Pankuruso sariyaw t'u yamariya ka minɛnw jalan kelenw ci, i bena do yɔrɔ mina.""

Translation of the key sentence: ""**The reason the people are looking for a worker is to do work.** The person in charge is looking for a worker to do work, and the work is very important, it doesn't have a short time.""

Therefore, the question asks what the people are looking for a worker to do. The answer is ""to do work,"" which is reflected in option C: ""Nin fɛnw bɛ ka ci inafɔ minɛn tɔgɔ sɛbɛnnen"" (The reason the people are looking for a worker is to do work).



"
"Ka da tɛmɛsira kan, Frequent Flyer pankurun cakɛda sugandi tɔn jɛkulu dɔ kɔnɔ, ninnu na jumɛn kan ka kɔn ka kɛ?","The correct answer is **C: I bɛ taama pankurun cakɛda min bolo ka caya**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:**  ""What kind of frequent flyer miles are usually used for?"" (Ka da tɛmɛsira kan, Frequent Flyer pankurun cakɛda sugandi tɔn jɛkulu dɔ kɔnɔ, ninnu na jumɛn kan ka kɔn ka kɛ?)
* **The provided text says:** ""Ali na sɔrɔ i be seka miri k'o ye miriya ɲuman ye ka ta pankuruso la i be woyase mina ka caya, i kan ka dɔ ko tɔnɔn minunw di tɛ kelen ye waatidɔw la ani pankuruta waatibɛ pɔnyin be seka kɛ ɲuman ye pankuruso dɔ wɛrɛla o kulu kelen kɔnɔ.""  This translates roughly to: ""Ali's group usually collects miles and uses them to pay for flights, and they can also use them for things other than flights, like upgrades or other travel benefits, and they use the miles to get better benefits.""
* **Option C translates to:** ""They usually use miles to get upgrades."" This aligns perfectly with the text's mention of using miles for ""upgrades"" (waatidɔw la).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pankurun cakɛda min bɛ kuru caman ni** (Miles that are easily earned) - The text doesn't focus on how miles are earned, but rather what they are used for.
* **B: Pankurun cakɛda mun bɛ jɛkulu bɛ la kunbaba kɔnɔ** (Miles that are accumulated over a long time) -  The text doesn't mention the time it takes to accumulate miles.
* **D: Pankurun cakɛda min bɛna sɔn ka kɛ farankan bɛrɛbɛrɛliw dili la** (Miles that are used for various special purposes) - While the text *does* mention using miles for things *other* than flights, it specifically highlights upgrades as a common use.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira ye, jɔn bɛ sɔn ka pankuruta waatibɛ pɔnyin caman di?","The correct answer is **D: Pankurun cakɛda wɛrɛ jɛkulu kelen in kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q):** ""Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira ye, jɔn bɛ sɔn ka pankuruta waatibɛ pɔnyin caman di?"" translates to ""What is the reason for the strong smell of the big basket?""

* **The Text (P):** The text describes a large, fragrant basket (pankuru pɔnyin sugandi). It mentions it's made of woven reeds (pankuruta waatibɛ) and that its aroma is due to the material it's made from.  The text emphasizes that the basket's scent is a result of the reeds themselves.

* **Analyzing the Options:**

    * **A: Pankurun cakɛda wɛrɛ jɛkulu wɛrɛ kɔnɔ** translates to ""The basket is made of dry reeds."" While the basket *is* made of reeds, the text focuses on the reeds' *fragrance*, not their dryness.
    * **B: I ka taama fanba pankurun cakɛda sira min fɛ jɛkulu kelen in kɔnɔ** translates to ""It is the fact that the basket is made of reeds that smells like dry reeds.""  The text doesn't explicitly state the reeds smell *like dry reeds*. It simply states the reeds *are* the source of the fragrance.
    * **C: I ka taama fanba pankurun cakɛda sira min fɛ jɛkulu wɛrɛ kɔnɔ** translates to ""It is the fact that the basket is made of reeds that smells like wet reeds.""  Again, the text doesn't specify wet reeds.
    * **D: Pankurun cakɛda wɛrɛ jɛkulu kelen in kɔnɔ** translates to ""The basket smells like the material it is made of."" This directly reflects the text's emphasis that the basket's fragrance originates from the reeds used to weave it.

Therefore, option D best answers the question based on the provided text.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira ye, dusukuntayɔrɔ jumɛn bɛ dugan k’a kɛ dɔlɔ minko juguya sababu ye?","The correct answer is **D: Sumatali**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes a situation where people believe their ancestors are angry and causing misfortune. They offer sacrifices (food, libations) and seek the help of spiritual leaders to appease them and restore harmony.

The question asks *why* people perform these rituals. The text explicitly states the rituals are performed to *appease the angry ancestors* and to *seek their help* to resolve the problems they believe are happening. 

Therefore, ""Sumatali"" (meaning ""to appease"" or ""to pacify"") is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mɛnni** (meaning ""no"" or ""not""): This is the opposite of what the text describes.
*   **B: Yeli** (meaning ""yes""): While the rituals are performed *because* people believe their ancestors are angry, the question asks the reason *why* they do it, not whether they do it.
*   **C: Nɛnɛli** (meaning ""to ignore"" or ""to disregard""): This is completely unrelated to the text.



"
"Inafɔ a fɔra cogo minna ni tɛmɛsira kɔnɔ, mun de tun be se ka dɔlɔ kɔlɔlɔ juguw baga faga?","The correct answer is **B: Dɔlɔ sipiritiw dagabali minni (Spirited water)**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes ""alikɔlimanfɛn"" as a magical substance used in rituals.** It mentions it's made from a specific type of fruit (cogoya) and is believed to possess spiritual power. It's used for healing and spiritual guidance.
* **The question asks about the source of this substance.**
* **The text explicitly states that ""Jama jama camaw be seka sɔrɔ sipiriti kɔnlenw la minunw be seka kɛ metanɔli ye, min be seka fiyɛn nati walima saya ali a fitini minli.""** This translates to something like: ""The people believe that the water used in these rituals contains spiritual power, which heals and protects them from evil.""  This directly links the substance to spiritual origins.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dɔlɔ ni metanɔli ɲagaminni minni (Water containing beneficial minerals):** While the water might have minerals, the text emphasizes the *spiritual* power, not just the mineral content.
* **C: Dɔlɔ minni hakɛ la (Sacred water):** ""Hakɛ la"" could mean sacred, but the text goes further and links it specifically to spiritual power and healing.
* **D: Minni ni mɔgɔ wɛrɛw ye (Water used by ancestors):** The text doesn't mention the water being *used by ancestors*, only that it contains spiritual power.



Therefore, **B (Spirited water)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
So walɛribaw Amsterdam sow cɛla bɛ min?,"The correct answer is **B: Yɔrɔ o yɔrɔ la min sugandira ka kɛ UNESCO Diɲɛ Cɛnma Yɔrɔ ko ye**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dugu in bɛɛ jiraleno inafɔ UNESCO Diɲɛ Cɛnma Yɔrɔ ko sababu ka k'a ladala ani tariku nafan kelen ye, ani a sow walɛri be jamana so walɛribaw cɛla."" This translates to: ""The district is nominated for UNESCO World Heritage because of its remarkable historical and cultural value, and its layout is characteristic of the time it was created.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Canal District:** This is just restating the name of the district, not *why* it's special.
* **C: Yɔrɔ minnu tun bɔlen don Binnenstad la:** This translates to ""The district is located near Binnenstad,"" which is true but doesn't explain its UNESCO status.
* **D: Tariku walɛribaw ma yɔrɔw:** This translates to ""The historical value of the district,"" which is related but not the complete answer.

Option B directly reflects the reason given in the passage for the Canal District being a UNESCO World Heritage site – its remarkable historical and cultural value.



"
Munna Canal District sungandira ka kɛ UNESCO Diɲɛ Cɛnma Yɔrɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Tariku nin danbe walɛri b’a la** (Its history and cultural heritage are preserved).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Dugu in bɛɛ jiraleno inafɔ UNESCO Diɲɛ Cɛnma Yɔrɔ ko sababu ka k'a ladala ani **tariku nafan kelen ye**"" (The canal district is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of its **rich history**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: So kɛrɛnkɛrɛnw b’a la** (Because of its architecture): While the architecture is part of the appeal, the text emphasizes the overall historical significance more.
* **C: A yɔrɔ bɛ ka Binnenstad la kolilen** (It is located near Binnenstad):  The location near Binnenstad is mentioned, but it's not the *reason* for the UNESCO designation.
* **D: Faama so walɛrilen don** (Because of the canals): While the canals are essential to the district, the text focuses on the broader historical and cultural heritage.



Therefore, option A directly reflects the reason given in the text for the Canal District being a UNESCO World Heritage site."
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jemɛn bɛ ka Phnom Krom lajɛli kɛ fɛn nafama ye?","The correct answer is **A: Ɲɛnafilɛli Tonle Sap sanfɛ** (It's located near Tonle Sap Lake).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tanpulu yɛlɛ ani nisondiya cogo ani Tonle Sap Lake lajɛli be kulu yɛlɛ in kɛ fɛn nafama."" This translates to ""The temple is located near Tonle Sap Lake and is a large, historical site.""  Therefore, Phnom Krom is situated near Tonle Sap Lake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Taama nin Angkor Pass ka sira ye** (It's near the Angkor Pass): The passage mentions Angkor Pass is needed to enter the temples, but it doesn't say Phnom Krom is *near* it.
* **C: Siem Reap yeli** (Siem Reap city): While Phnom Krom is *near* Siem Reap, the passage doesn't highlight that as a defining characteristic of its location. The key information is its proximity to Tonle Sap Lake.
* **D: Batɔɔn woyazi ka taa laki la** (Tourist buses that stop there): The passage says tourist buses stop there, but it's not the most important aspect of its location.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira ye, mun diyagoyalen bɛ filɛbagaw kan yaasa ka don Phnom Krom kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Ka yɛlɛ ka tɛmɛ Yasovarman alabatoso la** (It was built by King Yasovarman the younger).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Masakɛ Yasovarman ka fanga kɔnɔ."" which translates to ""It was built by King Yasovarman the younger.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Siem Reap laminin taama** (Siem Reap is a tourist attraction): While Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, the question asks *what* Phnom Krom is *known for*. The text focuses on the temple itself, not the city.
* **C: Angkor Pass sɔrɔli** (Angkor Pass is expensive): While the Angkor Pass is required, the question is about *what Phnom Krom is known for*, not the cost of entry.
* **D: Batɔɔn woyazi Tonle Sap laminin na** (Tourists to Tonle Sap): The text mentions Tonle Sap Lake's proximity, but it doesn't say Phnom Krom is known for attracting tourists to the lake.

Therefore, the only answer directly supported by the text is the construction by King Yasovarman the younger.

"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn tun be bɛ turisiw bali ka ta bɔ Antarctica la?","The correct answer is **C: Baara waati min b’a to i bɛ taama Desanburu nin Zanwuye kalo kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""If you want to travel to Antarctica, when is the best time to go?""
* **The text states:** ""Andũ ngiri ciganona aruti wĩra nĩmaikaraga gũkũ ihinda rĩa summer thĩini wa kambĩ mĩrongo ĩtano; andũ anini nĩmaikaraga kũu ngina ihinda rĩa winter."" (Many tourists choose to visit during the summer within 50 days; some choose to visit during the winter.)

The text explicitly mentions the summer months (November-February) are popular for tourism. Options A, B, and D don't directly address the *best* time for travel based on the provided text. Option C correctly points to the winter months (December and January) as a potential time to go, consistent with the text mentioning some tourists visit during the winter. However, the text more strongly emphasizes the summer as the preferred time for most tourists.

Therefore, **C** is the closest and most reasonable answer based on the limited information provided. It's important to note that the text doesn't definitively state the *absolute best* time, only that both summer and winter are options, with summer being more popular.
"
Turisi min tun mako donnen do kulukan yɛlɛ la tun bɛ ka Antarctica yɔrɔ jumɛn lajɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Peninsula**.

The text states: ""Gũcera kũu kwĩ goro, kwendaga ucamba, kũngĩhanĩka tu mĩerinĩ ya summer Nov-Feb, na **mũngĩcerio o Peninsula**...""

This translates to: ""The most common way to get there is by ship, traveling to the coast, and gathering in the areas of summer Nov-Feb, and **the Peninsula**...""

Therefore, the Peninsula is listed as a place where tourists commonly go to visit Antarctica.
"
Lajɛkɛyɔrɔ minunw ye bi kɔn ma teli ka kɛ yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **A: Yɔrɔ lasɔrɔduman**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where the police are investigating a crime (the theft).** The text mentions a suspect who might have been involved.
* **The question asks *who* is likely to have committed the crime.**
* **""Yɔrɔ lasɔrɔduman"" translates to ""The thief's family.""** This is the most logical answer, as the police would investigate the family of the suspect to gather more information and potentially find the stolen goods.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Dugu camancɛ (The old man's house):** While the old man might be a witness, it's unlikely the crime happened *in* his house.
* **C: Yɔrɔ samanen (The father's house):** Similar to B, the father's house is a potential location for questioning, but not necessarily the perpetrator's location.
* **D: Sanfɛ kalanso lakɔliden jigiso (The bright, beautiful, and shiny fortress):** This is a metaphorical or poetic description and doesn't relate to who committed the crime.

Therefore, **A: Yɔrɔ lasɔrɔduman** is the most appropriate and logical answer based on the information provided in the passage."
Sisan ɲɛɲinlini lajɛlikɛlaw ka teli ka mara min?,"The correct answer is **C: Kalankɛyɔrɔkɛnɛ**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""What is the *reason* (mara) for the police action?"" The passage states that the police action is because of ""kalankɛyɔrɔw"" (stolen goods) and that they are looking for ""bibi in na cogomina"" (criminals in the area).  ""Kalankɛyɔrɔkɛnɛ"" translates to ""theft"" or ""robbery,"" which directly relates to the reason for the police's actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mize dɔ kɔnɔ** (The people are there): While people are present, this doesn't explain *why* the police are there.
* **B: Sanfɛkalanso lakɔlidenjigiso** (Law enforcement organization): This is a general description of the police, not the reason for their current activity.
* **D: Baarakɛso belebeleba** (Political tension/conflict): The passage doesn't mention any political tension.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, jidawolo jumɛn bɛ sɔn ka ɲɛ kosɔbɛ tile kelen lafiya ma?","The answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

The text describes the location of certain housing areas in Auckland. It specifically mentions:

*   ""Icũa cia Tamaki Drive ciĩ thĩinĩ wa Waitemata Harbour, ĩrĩa ĩrĩ thĩinĩ wa icegerera cĩa Mission Bay na St Heliers thĩinĩ wa Central Aukland."" 

This translates to: ""Houses on Tamaki Drive, within Waitemata Harbour, within the areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers within Central Auckland.""

Therefore, Mission Bay is one of the locations mentioned in the text as a housing area. The question asks where someone would stay if they wanted to be near a nice place, and Mission Bay is presented as a nice place within the described housing areas.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, nɔnni cogow jumɛn te tɛli ka kɛ lakana kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **B: North Harbor District**.

Here's why:

The passage describes three areas where houses are built:

*   **North Shore (within the North Harbour district):** This is the first area mentioned, and the description details its location and characteristics.
*   **Houses along Tamaki Drive (within Waitemata Harbour):** This area is described as being within the areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers, which are part of Central Auckland.
*   **Long Bay:** This is mentioned as the starting point of a road that runs along the coast.

Option B, **North Harbor District**, encompasses the North Shore and is the most accurate description of the first area described in the text.
"
"Ni tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ yɔrɔ lakalilen tun lajɛtɔ, ninnu jumɛn tun bina jate inafɔ kɔnnen ye?","The correct answer is **D: Desin cɛnliw sojɔlen dɔ lo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the Holocaust.** The passage explicitly mentions the Holocaust and the Nazi regime. 
* **The question asks about the reason for the widespread killing of Jews.** The passage states that the Holocaust was carried out by the Nazi regime, and the description of Nazi actions (killing Jews and other groups) directly explains the widespread killings.
* **Option D, ""Desin cɛnliw sojɔlen dɔ lo"" (The soldier of the Nazi regime),** directly relates to the perpetrators of the Holocaust and therefore the reason for the widespread killing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sɛbɛya kɛli (The simple/easy way):** This doesn't explain *why* the killings happened.
* **B: Ka taamasiɲɛn to kɛnɛ kɛrɛ dɔ fɛ (To find a way to make things better):** While this might be a *response* to the problem, it doesn't explain the initial cause.
* **C: Yɛlɛkokuma fɔliw (The desire to succeed):** This is a very general and unrelated reason for the Holocaust.

Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately answers the question based on the provided passage."
Ninnu jumɛn bɛ forobakanw lakali?,"The correct answer is **A: Hadamaden ka dilalen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gɛrɛfɛ kanw ye kan dilaniw minunw dilana walasa ka kuma waleya nɔgɔya mɔgɔw nin ɲɔgɔncɛ min bena kunbalan sɔrɔ kuma siratigɛ fɛ."" This translates roughly to: ""The giraffe is a creature that speaks, and it has the power to understand the language of humans and animals, and it is very wise and strategic.""

Then the text says: ""U danbɔɔleno forobakanla, mɔgɔ ma min dilan walima kɔnɔna kanw min bena kɛ kan min sera tɔw ye kun kelen na walima kun wɛrɛ inafɔ kuma siraw kan wɛrɛw fɔbaw nin ɲɔgɔncɛ."" This translates roughly to: ""It [the giraffe] can give advice.  The people who speak to it often ask it for advice, and the advice it gives is very helpful and wise.""

The question asks: ""Ninnu jumɛn bɛ forobakanw lakali?"" which means ""What kind of advice does it give?""

The text directly states: ""U danbɔɔleno forobakanla"" which means ""It can give advice."" The following sentence details the nature of that advice – it's helpful and wise. Therefore, the answer should be something that relates to the *type* of advice the giraffe gives.

* **A: Hadamaden ka dilalen (The advice is wise):** This aligns with the text which states the giraffe's advice is ""very helpful and wise.""
* **B: Mɔgɔ ye min dilan (People who speak):** This refers to *who* asks for advice, not *what* the advice is.
* **C: Jɔlen (Understanding):** This refers to the giraffe's ability to understand language, not the type of advice it gives.
* **D: Kɔnɔna (Agreement):** This refers to a state of agreement, not the nature of the advice.

Therefore, **A: Hadamaden ka dilalen (The advice is wise)** is the best and most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
Nunnu kumasen jumɛn tɛ gɛrɛfɛ kanw lakali tigitigi?,"The correct answer is **B: U ye kanw ye minnu dilan wa u ladilalen fana**

Here's why:

* **The question (Q):** ""Nunnu kumasen jumɛn tɛ gɛrɛfɛ kanw lakali tigitigi?"" translates to ""What kind of animal is the giraffe, that it can easily reach tall trees and eat leaves of trees that other animals can't reach?""

* **The initial text (P):** Describes the giraffe's long neck, allowing it to reach high into trees and eat leaves that other animals cannot. It also mentions its powerful legs and its ability to run quickly.

* **Analyzing the options:**
    * **A:** ""U ye kɔnɔna kanw ye minnu tun labaarala ka kumaɲɔgɔnya nɔgɔya mɔgɔw cɛ minnu be se ka dɛsɛ ka ɲɔgɔn faamuya cogo wɛrɛlama"" translates to ""It is an animal that has a very long neck and allows other animals to easily eat fruit with its tongue."" This is incorrect because the giraffe's neck is for reaching leaves, not fruit, and the text doesn't mention its tongue.
    * **B:** ""U ye kanw ye minnu dilan wa u ladilalen fana"" translates to ""It is an animal that has a long neck so that it can reach."" This accurately reflects the giraffe's ability to reach high into trees due to its long neck, as described in the text.
    * **C:** ""U ye kanw ye minnu ladilana yaasa ka kumaɲɔgɔnya yɔrɔw gɛlɛnmanw lanɔgɔya"" translates to ""It is an animal that has a strong tongue so that it can eat leaves of trees that other animals can't."" This is incorrect because the giraffe's strength is in its neck and legs, not its tongue.
    * **D:** ""K'an dilalenw don minnu fɔli ka ca mɔgɔw minnu tɛ k'an kelɛn fɔ"" translates to ""Its legs are strong so that it can run quickly."" While the text mentions the giraffe's powerful legs, the question is specifically about its neck.

Therefore, option **B** is the only one that directly and accurately answers the question based on the information provided in the initial text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, taamaden tun be se kakan ka sɛgɛsɛgɛ n’a ya sɔrɔ u ka jikuru bɛ bɔ fonɛnɛ fɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Waati min tun tɛmɛna k’i to dugu kɔnɔ (Water that has been frozen to a great extent).**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Saint Petersburg mɔgɔta batɔn be dugu waati ta."" (Saint Petersburg's ice is made of water.)
* **The question asks:** ""Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, taamaden tun be se kakan ka sɛgɛsɛgɛ n’a ya sɔrɔ u ka jikuru bɛ bɔ fonɛnɛ fɛ?"" (What is the reason why the ice is so large and always present?)
* **The answer then suggests:** ""Kabini sigiyɔrɔ"" (The cold weather).
* **The text further explains:** ""Batɔn woyazikɛlaw baleleno ka bɔ wiza tali laɲininw ma (Benkanw lajɛ)."" (The ice is formed from large quantities of frozen water.)

Therefore, the reason the ice is so large and present is due to the **very cold weather** that freezes the water to a large extent. Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kabini sigiyɔrɔ (The cold weather):** While the cold weather is *the reason*, the question asks for *what* the ice is made of, not the cause of its formation.
* **B: Wiza tali laɲininw (Frozen water):** This describes what the ice *is* made of, not why it's so large.
* **C: Benkanw (Large quantities of frozen water):** This also describes what the ice is made of, not the reason for its size and persistence."
"ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, nin batɔn woyazikɛlaw bɛ funteni bɔ waati kɔnɔ, mun tun be sen ka bali?","The correct answer is **C: Wiza tali laɲininw**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Batɔn woyazikɛlaw baleleno ka bɔ wiza tali laɲininw ma (Benkanw lajɛ)."" This translates to ""The pilgrims went to buy pilgrimage tickets (Benkanw lajɛ).""
* **The question asks:** ""ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, nin batɔn woyazikɛlaw bɛ funteni bɔ waati kɔnɔ, mun tun be sen ka bali?""  This means ""What did the pilgrims go to buy, and why did they spend money there?""
* **The text indicates:**  Pilgrims spent money on ""wiza tali laɲininw"" (pilgrimage tickets). 

Therefore, option C is the direct answer to the question based on the provided text.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Waatibɛɛ kunafɔni Meturo kɔnɔ be Catalan dɔrɔn dela, nka kobalenliw bolodabaliw be fɔ cogoya dilane kabila kan camaw la inafɔ ɛsipaɲɔli, angilɛ, faransɛ, arabu ani zapɔnɛ.""
* **Translation:** ""The public transportation in Catalan areas uses the same signage and announcements as in Spanish, but also includes information in various other languages such as English, French, Arabic and Japanese.""
* **The question asks:** ""Where can you find Catalan in public transportation in Barcelona?""
* **Option D directly reflects this information.** It says that public transportation (meturo and jamana yɔrɔ wɛrɛw - meaning buses and trains) in Catalan areas uses Catalan signage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A bɛ faamu yɔrɔ caman na ka tɛmɛ Ɛsipaɲɔli ka (It is necessary to know Spanish to communicate):** While knowing Spanish is helpful in Barcelona, the passage doesn't claim it's *necessary* to understand Catalan in public transportation.
* **B: Dugu sariya kan fɔlɔ kun don (There is no Catalan signage):** The passage explicitly states that Catalan *is* used for signage.
* **C: Barcelona ka kan mandi do (Barcelona is a large city):** The size of the city isn't relevant to where you find Catalan in transportation.



Therefore, option D is the only one supported by the passage.
"
Ninnu kanw jumɛn bɛ itilize waatibɛɛ kunafɔni na Barcelone Meturo fɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ɛsipaɲɔli**.

The text states: ""Waatibɛɛ kunafɔni Meturo kɔnɔ be Catalan dɔrɔn dela, nka kobalenliw bolodabaliw be fɔ cogoya dilane kabila kan camaw la inafɔ ɛsipaɲɔli..."" which translates to: ""The tourist information center in Barcelona, in addition to providing information in Catalan, also offers information in Spanish...""  This clearly indicates that Spanish is one of the languages used at the tourist information center.

Here's why:

* **The text describes the B&B's amenities:** The text explicitly states that the B&B offers ""fɔlɔfɔlɔ dilan"" (free Wi-Fi) and also mentions other amenities like a garden, playground, and swimming pool.
* **The question asks what is included in the price:**  The question asks what is included in the price when booking.  Free Wi-Fi is a standard amenity that is often included in accommodation prices.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Kɛrɛnkɛrɛnw yɔrɔ (Parking):** While the text mentions parking, it doesn't say it's *included* in the price. Parking is frequently an extra charge.
    * **C: Kɛnɛma yɔrɔw ladonkoɲuman (Kitchen equipment):** The text doesn't specifically detail kitchen equipment.
    * **D: WiFi tɛliman (Wi-Fi router):**  A Wi-Fi router is a component of a Wi-Fi system, but ""fɔlɔ so masiriw dɔrɔn ye"" (Free Wi-Fi) is the better and more encompassing answer.

"Ka da ni tɛmɛnsira in ka, ninnu jumɛn te ye ɲɔgɔndan kun yɛrɛyɛrɛ ye B&Bs ka fɛnw ɲumanw cɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Sanfɛ dilan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the advantages of B&Bs.** It specifically mentions things like a comfortable atmosphere, delicious food, and a relaxing environment with amenities like a pool and garden.
* **The question asks what makes B&Bs attractive to travelers.**
* **The passage highlights the ""sanfɛ dilan"" (comfortable atmosphere/amenities) as a key factor.**  The description of the environment and facilities directly supports this as a major draw for visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Diɲɛn laban mansiri (All are simple):** The passage emphasizes that B&Bs are *not* simple; they offer comfort and amenities.
* **B: Waati ni waati daraga diliw (They are always expensive):** The passage doesn't state that B&Bs are always expensive. They might be more affordable than hotels, but cost isn't the main point being made.
* **D: Dudun dumini ni ji (Big rooms and bathrooms):** While B&Bs might have decent rooms and bathrooms, it's not the central focus of the passage. The emphasis is on the overall *atmosphere* and *amenities*.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, ninnu jumɛn tɛna kɛ Beijing san 2022?","The correct answer is **A: Tulɔnkɔw dayɛlɛli (Infrastructure)**.

The passage states that Beijing built ""tulɔnkɔw dayɛlɛli ani tuguli tulɔnkɔ kun bɛ ani sɔkɔnɔna gilasi zuyew"" which translates to ""infrastructure and new buildings and glass stadiums"" for the Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Taizicheng sikilkɛ zuye kɛ yɔrɔw (Taizicheng railway to Zhangjiakou):** While mentioned, this is just a specific part of the infrastructure and not the overarching theme.
* **C: Tulɔnkɔw datuguli (New buildings):** This is a part of the infrastructure, but ""infrastructure"" is a more encompassing term.
* **D: Sɔkɔnɔna gilasi zuyew (Glass stadiums):** These are specific buildings, not the general infrastructure.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn bɛna kun bɛ Beijing fɛ san 2022?","The correct answer is **A: Tilemanfɛ Olympics**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Beijing dugu Siniwajamana kɔnɔ bena kɛ Olymic Winter Games san 2022 kun bɛ baga ye, min bena kɛ dugu fɔlɔ ye min be tilema ani nɛnɛ zuye olɛnpiki kun bɛ.""

Jɔn bɛ farati danna ka kumasɛbɛfɔlila giripu sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kɔnɔlajɛlaw**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Who helped John recover from the flu?""
* **The text says:** ""Mɔgɔ minɛnw camaw be siyɛ baarakɛ, nka kɔnɔlajɛlaw fɛnɛ be faratila.""  This translates to ""My friends gave him medicine, and the doctor helped him recover.""  The word ""kɔnɔlajɛlaw"" means ""doctor"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mɔgɔ minnu bɛ baara kɛ ni sindi ye** - ""My friends gave him medicine"" - While friends helped, the question specifically asks *who* helped him recover from the flu.
* **C: Siyɛ baarakɛbagaw** - ""Medicine"" - This is what was given, not who helped recover.
* **D: Banakisɛ ye mɔgɔ minnu sɔrɔ ta tɛmɛ** - ""Children and other people who were there"" - This is not who helped him specifically recover from the flu.

Here's why:

* **P (Question):** The speaker is complaining about having a cough and a fever, feeling weak, and having trouble breathing. They mention seeking help from doctors, but the medicine didn't work. They also say their family members are worried and expressing concern.
* **Q (Question):** The question asks what is the reason why medicine doesn't help the speaker's illness.
* **A (Answer):**  ""Siyɛ baarakɛbagaw dɔrɔn de ye mura bana sɔrɔ"" translates to ""The medicine is not strong enough for the speaker's illness."" This directly addresses the problem stated in the question – why the medicine isn't effective.  It aligns with the speaker's experience of having taken medicine without improvement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A ɲɔgɔnko caman yera adamadenw na ka tɛmɛn kɔnɔw kan:** ""The cold is spreading to other people."" This isn't the reason *why the medicine isn't working* for the speaker.
* **C: Kɔnɔlajɛlaw bɛ faratila ka banakisɛ sɔrɔ:** ""Doctors are worried about the speaker's health."" While the family is worried, the question is about the medicine's effectiveness, not the doctor's worry.
* **D: Minnu tun yera adamadenw na bɛɛ labana sayala:** ""We are also taking medicine and not recovering."" This is a general statement about the family but doesn't specifically explain why the speaker's medicine isn't working.

Therefore, option A is the most logical and accurate answer to the question.

White Sea-Baltic Canali bɛ tugu ɲɔgɔnna?,"The correct answer is **C: Ocean Arctic ani Balitic Sea**.

Therefore, option C is the accurate answer.

Here's why:

* The text states that people are denied entry to a country if they lack a passport or other travel documents.
* ""Pankuruw"" translates to ""passport"" in the provided context.
* The question asks what people need if they lack documents to enter a country.

Therefore, the answer is **Pankuruw (Passport)**.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jumɛn i ka karididantite bɛ se ka sɛgɛsɛgɛ Furɔntiyɛri tirɛw dɔw la?","The correct answer is **A: I jiginen ka bɔ tirɛ kɔnɔ**.

This translates to: ""In the frontier, the government issues identification documents to people who are registering for citizenship.""

* **The question asks:** ""Why is it necessary to have an identification document from the frontier government?""  

* **Option A (I jiginen ka bɔ tirɛ kɔnɔ - It's necessary to register)** is the closest to the reason given in the passage.  The passage implies that having an ID is a *result* of registering.  The underlying reason for registration isn't explicitly stated, but it's implied to be a prerequisite for obtaining an ID.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I bɛ sunɔgɔla waatimin - It's for collecting data.** While collecting data is *part* of the registration process, it's not the primary reason for needing an ID.
* **C: A tɛ sɛgɛsɛgɛ - It's a requirement.** While it *is* a requirement, the passage doesn't specifically state that it's simply a requirement. It implies that it's connected to the citizenship process.
* **D: Tirɛ boli tɔ - The government has power.** This is too broad and not directly related to the specific question about identification documents.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i bena ɲɛnɛbɔ ni funtɛni (waatibɛɛla) ani tile ye (tumamina sankolo jɛleno, cogoya gɛlɛ dɔgɔmanila)."" This translates to ""...it [Singapore] has a lot of gardens and parks (green spaces) and also (modern) buildings, (tall skyscrapers).""

The question asks what people in Singapore do to relax in Singapore's ""jimayɔrɔ belebelebala"" (which likely refers to the beautiful/amazing Singapore). The passage mentions ""gardens and parks"" (funtɛni carini fɛ) as a place people can go for relaxation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka bin i kan** (They are watching) - The passage doesn't mention watching anything.
*   **B: Ka bali butiki taalilila** (They are shopping) - While Singapore is known for shopping, the passage focuses on relaxation in natural and architectural spaces.
*   **D: Ka tunu** (They are praying) - The passage doesn't mention praying.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Alimaɲi dumuni jɛniniw camaw la fɛnɛ la, amandiw, nuwazɛtiw ani jiri kolow dɔwɛrɛw b'u cɛla."" This translates to: ""German pastries often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.""

Therefore, people with nut allergies would avoid German pastries. The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"

The text states: ""Pate yiridenmanw be fanbɛ, nin pate dilani ye nin pomu ye san mumɛ bɛɛ kɔnɔ..."" which translates to ""Pastries are very popular, and the most popular pastry is the apple...""

Therefore, the answer is **Pomu (Apple)**.

"Ka da nin tɛmɛnsira in ka, ninnu jumɛn tɛ fɛnyamariyalen ye duguta musaga la?","The correct answer is **D: Ka dɔbɔ dumini ni siyɔrɔ musaga la** (Because it is the cause of disease and various ailments).

Here's why:

* **The text describes how the 'nin' (presumably a harmful substance) causes various health problems.** It mentions stomach aches, headaches, fever, vomiting, and weakens the body. It also states that it can cause skin problems and make people weak and tired.
* **The question asks *why* the 'nin' causes these problems.**
* **Option D directly addresses the cause by stating that it's the source of diseases and ailments.** This aligns perfectly with the information provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka baara dɔ sɔrɔ i ka dugutaga senfɛ** (Because the water is the source of various ailments): The text focuses on the 'nin', not water.
* **B: Ka i janto i ka hɛra tuma la** (Because it is the result of the body's effort): This doesn't explain *why* the 'nin' causes problems; it describes a consequence.
* **C: Ka waari ɲinni mɔgɔw fɛ** (Because it is the manifestation of the body's spirit): This is a spiritual explanation and doesn't fit the practical, health-related description in the text.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the dangers of not taking care of one's health.** It mentions illnesses, suffering, and the importance of seeking medical help.
* **The question asks what people do when they get sick.**
* **Option C translates to: ""People who are sick go to the doctor for treatment.""** This directly aligns with the passage's emphasis on seeking medical help when unwell.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mɔgɔ min bɛ gɛlɛya kun bɛ (People who are sick are dying):** The passage doesn't explicitly state that sick people are dying. It talks about suffering and the need for care.
* **B: Mɔgɔ hali waati dɔnni tɛ a bolo (People who are healthy are strong):** While the passage implies that good health leads to strength, it doesn't focus on the characteristics of healthy people.
* **D: Sira dɔ minnɛni kadi mɔgɔ ye (The child is the most important person):** The passage doesn't discuss the importance of children.

The passage states: ""Witesi dan tamasiyɛn ka dɔgɔ ka tɛmɛ fanw tɛmɛniw tɔw kan - waaticamana 35-40 kilomɛtiri lɛri kɔnɔ (56-64 kilomɛtiri lɛri kɔnɔ) - ani u batoli kan ka kɛ kɔsɛɛbɛ cogoya ka tɛmɛ alisa tɔw kan. Kabakoko kɔni, nɛgɛjuru sira fagan ka bɔn yan ka sira yɔrɔ tɔw camaw kan, misalila, the Pennsylvania Wilds.""

This translates to: ""Bus tours of about 35-40 kilometers (56-64 kilometers) in length are available, and the route goes through scenic areas. Furthermore, guided tours are available that take you to different destinations, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.""

Therefore, the passage directly mentions that guided bus tours are available. The other options are not supported by the text.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, nin jumɛn ka kɛn ka dabɔ yɛrɛyɛrɛ bolimafɛn bolilaw ka boli la Buffalo-Pittsburg siraba kan?","The correct answer is **C: Ka tɛliya ka sirafara ta**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nin i ma deli kunkokɔnɔna siraw bolilila, i janto kosɛbɛ: yɛlɛ ka jigi garo garolen, sira fitiniw, ani sirafaran tileninw be fan bɛɛ."" This translates to: ""It is also a destination for those who like to travel, and it offers hiking, biking, and rafting.""  

The question asks about the primary activity that draws people to Sirafurancɛ Point Marion and Fairmont in relation to the Buffalo-Pittsburgh corridor. Since rafting is listed as one of the activities, and rafting is a water-based activity along rivers, the answer must be related to water travel. 

Option C, ""Ka tɛliya ka sirafara ta"" (It is a destination for whitewater rafting), directly addresses this. The other options are not supported by the text:

*   A: Ka koron sira falen kan (It is a place for fishing) - While the text mentions fishing, it's not the primary focus in the context of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh corridor.
*   B: Nɛgɛjuru sira baara caya sɔrɔbaliya (It is a place for hunting and observing wildlife) - Hunting and wildlife observation are mentioned as activities in the broader area but aren't the specific reason for people to visit Sirafurancɛ Point Marion and Fairmont in connection to the Buffalo-Pittsburgh corridor.
*   D: Ka siraba gilalenw caman yeli (It is a place for scenic drives) - The text mentions scenic drives, but it is not the central activity highlighted in the provided text.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C**."
Ninnu jumɛn ma jagoya ka bolili kulufulancɛɛ jira sanfɛ daminɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Nɔnni se**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Do you know what the main components of the bolili kulufulancɛ jira sanfɛ are?"" (Essentially asking for the ingredients)
* **The text states:** ""Bolili kulufulancɛ jira sanfɛ be nɔnili, yɛlɛli ani pani fɛnw faraɲɔgɔnkan..."" which translates to ""Bolili kulufulancɛ jira sanfɛ are made of, flour and other ingredients...""
* **""Nɔnni se""** means ""Yes, it is"" or ""Indeed."" This is the most appropriate response because the text *does* list the components.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Farikolo kɛnɛya ɲuman** means ""A certain amount of sugar."" While sugar might be *one* ingredient, it doesn't represent the *main* components.
* **C: Panni se** means ""Water.""  Again, water is likely an ingredient but not the main components.
* **D: Kalanni hakɛya dɔgɔma** means ""A large amount of butter."" Similar to sugar and water, butter is probably an ingredient, but not the defining main components.



"
Ninnu jumɛn bɛ se ka nafa kɛ bolili kulufulancɛ jira sanfɛ boli la?,"The correct answer is **B: Famuyali fɔlɔw sumarɛn ka nɔɔni kan**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What are the causes of the increase in the population of the desert locust?""
* **The text (P) states:**  Desert locust populations increase significantly due to favorable weather conditions and a large amount of vegetation.  It also mentions that they are attracted to areas with abundant food.
* **Option B translates to:** ""The increase follows a pattern of favorable weather.""  This directly aligns with the text's mention of favorable weather conditions as a cause.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Boli se ɲɛtaga (The population is a blessing):** The text describes the locusts as a problem, not a blessing.
* **C: Bolili kulufulancɛ jira sanfɛdɔnni bugunatigɛ sɛbɛn (Desert locusts are only found in certain areas):**  The text doesn't limit their location; it discusses their widespread potential.
* **D: Nɔnni se (It is not):** This is a general negative statement and doesn't offer a specific cause.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the given text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jumɛn de bɛ seka kɛ dɛmɛ ye mɔgɔ min bɛ ka fɛrɛ kɛ ka to a ka mɔbili kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **B: Bolimafɛn min sigilanw bɛ se ka t’i bi da**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What kinds of vehicles are typically used to transport people (referring to the previous text about cars)?
* **The text states:** ""Mobili jɔlensigili be seka kɛ nin mobili kɔnɔfɛrɛlen ba b'i bolo, SUV, Sedan walima Wagon Station nin sigiyɔrɔw minunw be kari.""  This translates to: ""Passenger cars are used for transporting people, such as SUVs, Sedans, and Wagon Stations, and other types of vehicles.""
* **Option B** directly reflects this by stating ""Bolimafɛn min sigilanw bɛ se ka t’i bi da"" which translates to ""Passenger cars are used for this"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Famuyaba i ka bolima fɛn danw kan** - This translates to ""This is the advantage of passenger cars."" While passenger cars *have* advantages, the question asks *what kinds* are used, not their advantages.
* **C: Tanti** - This means ""Tanti"" (which is a bit unclear on its own, but related to ""tanti"" = many, multiple). This doesn't answer the question about *types* of vehicles.
* **D: Wali yɔrɔ dɔ la ka jɔlensigili kɛ** - This translates to ""The tall ones use passenger cars"".  This is too specific and not generally true.  Not only are tall people not the only ones who use passenger cars, but the text specifies a range of vehicle *types*.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, mobili jɔlensigilibaw bɛ fɛ ka fɛn jumɛn kɔtɛrɛma bɔ nu bɛ k’a ɲini ka to yɔrɔ dɔnnen dɔ la?","The correct answer is **A: Bolimafɛn belebeleba dɔ bolili, i n'a fɔ SUV dɔ walima mobili kɔnɔfɛrɛlen** (Cars are available in various types, including SUVs and sedans).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What types of cars are available for people who travel in groups?""
* **The provided text states:** ""Mobili jɔlensigili be seka kɛ nin mobili kɔnɔfɛrɛlen ba b'i bolo, SUV, Sedan walima Wagon Station nin sigiyɔrɔw minunw be kari."" (Large cars are available in various types, including SUVs, Sedans, Wagon Station, and minivans.)

Option A directly reflects this information by mentioning SUVs and sedans as examples of available car types.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Woyazi sira jan dɔ tali** (People travel in groups) - This is a restatement of the question, not an answer.
* **C: Tanti dɔ turuli dugu kɔnɔ walima wali yɔrɔ dɔ la** (These are large cars and other types) - This is too general and doesn't specify types suitable for groups.
* **D: Delinabaliya u ka baarakɛ bolimafɛn na** (The car body is made of steel) - This describes the construction of a car, not its type.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔnni tun ye Casablanca jɔ siɲɛn filanan na?","The correct answer is **A: Portugal mɔgɔw**.

The text states: ""Casablanca kun ye yɔrɔ nafan ma fitini yɔrɔ ye sanila Maroc kɔnɔ. Portugal mɔgɔw y'o ci ani k'o jɔ duguni nin Casa Branca tɔgɔ, ka ban alan dɔrɔ dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ dɔ kɔfɛ san ba 1755.""  This translates to: ""Casablanca is a prominent port and a major economic hub of Morocco. The Portuguese built the city and its fortress called Casa Branca...""

Therefore, the Portuguese were the ones who established Casablanca.
"
Jɔnni tun bolila Casablanca dugu kɔnɔ kasara dɔ kɔfɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Portugal mɔgɔw**.

The text states: ""Portugal mɔgɔw y'o ci ani k'o jɔ duguni nin Casa Branca tɔgɔ..."" which translates to ""Portuguese people took over and built Casa Branca..."". This indicates the Portuguese were the ones who initially developed Casablanca.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Sintra tun ye koɲumandɔn sɔrɔ cogodi kɔfɛmɔgɔw cɛla?","The correct answer is **A: Cabo da Roca**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Scotturb bisi 403 be ta tumacamana Sintra, nin jɔli ye Cabo de Roca la."" This translates to ""Scotturb bus 403 goes to Sintra, and it stops at Cabo de Roca.""

The question asks what is a notable landmark in Sintra.  The text explicitly mentions Cabo de Roca as a landmark reached by a bus line going to Sintra. The other options are related to Sintra but are not presented as specific landmarks *within* Sintra in this text.
"
Mun ma koɲumandɔn Armenie fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Nagoro-Karabakh maarayɔrɔ**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""What is the main conflict of Armenia?"" The text states that the main conflict is over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is currently under Armenian control and claimed by Azerbaijan. Options B, C, and D are related to the conflict but not the core of Armenia's main conflict.
"
Fɛn jumɛn bɛka Azerbajan ani Armenie cɛ ciyɛn?,"The correct answer is **D: Nagorno-Karabakh maarayɔrɔ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""San 1994, Azerbajan maarayɔrɔ Armenie-Nagoro-Karabakh siyakuku ye kɛlɛ tikɛ Azeriw la."" This translates to ""Since 1994, the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which was under Armenian control, has been a point of contention between Azerbaijanis.""

The passage directly links the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia to the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The other options are related but not the primary cause as stated in the text:

* **A: Armenie mɔgɔw minnu bɛ sigi la Azerbajan:** ""Armenian people have been oppressing Azerbaijan"" - While this is a claim often made, the text doesn't explicitly state this as the *starting point* of the conflict.
* **B: San 1994 kɛlɛ:** ""Since 1994"" - This is a timeframe, not the *reason* for the conflict.
* **C: Politiki mankanw:** ""Political maneuvers"" - This is a general factor, but the passage identifies Nagorno-Karabakh as the specific issue driving those maneuvers.



"
"Ka sɔrɔ takisi dɔ bɛ ka ta Charlotte, fɛn tun bɛna dɔ fara doni ka?","The correct answer is **C: Ka taa Uptown**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""San 20 tɛmɛni kɔ, denmisɛni teriya hakɛya cogow Uptown Charlotte kɔnɔ yɛlɛna kɔsɛbɛ kɔsɛbɛ."" This translates to: ""On January 20th, the taxi union held a press conference in Uptown Charlotte.""

Therefore, the taxi drivers were protesting *in* Uptown Charlotte.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun tun be se ka kɛ jate gɛlɛya ye Charlotte kɔnɔna ni denminsenw ye?","The correct answer is **C: Yɔrɔ wɛrɛw sigibaw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hakilina jɔlen kelen kabɔ Charlotte yɔrɔ, Caroline du Nord, ye ko a nafan ɲuman baw cogoya se denbayaw ma."" This translates to ""The Hakilina hotel in Charlotte, North Carolina, is a place that is often booked by many people for business.""
* **The question asks:** ""What is it that many people use Charlotte for?"" This is asking the reason *why* people visit Charlotte.
* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...denbayaw ma"" which means ""for business."" And the earlier sentence says the Hakilina hotel is often booked by people *for business*.
* **Option C: Yɔrɔ wɛrɛw sigibaw** translates to ""Business travel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: So sɔnkɔw** translates to ""Social gatherings."" The passage focuses on business, not social events.
* **B: Takisi dɔ tali** translates to ""Taxis travel."" The passage mentions taxis, but it doesn't say that's *why* people use Charlotte.
* **D: K'a lajɛ ka duguba diya bɔ** translates to ""To find a place to live."" The passage discusses business travel, not residency.



"
"Yani Ɛsipaɲɔliw nali cɛ, Chilie kɔkɔdugu yanfan tun bɛ jɔnni ka mara kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Araucanians**.

The text states: ""Yani Ɛpaɲɔliw nali cɛ siyɛkili 16 kɔnɔ, Chilie kɔkɔdugu yanfan kun be Incaw ka mara kɔnɔ tumamina **Araucanians** sigibaw (Mapuche) kun sigilen Chilie camancɛra ani worodugu yanfan fɛ.""

This translates to: ""In the 16th century, Chile's lands were initially controlled by the Incas, but then the **Araucanians** (Mapuche) began to fight for Chilean lands and resist Spanish domination.""

Therefore, the Araucanians (Mapuche) were the people who initially fought against the Incas and later against the Spanish.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn tun ma ma kɛ san 1810?","The correct answer is **C: Napoleon ka kɛlɛw tun bɛ senna**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ali na sɔrɔ Chilie y'a ka yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya fɔ san 1810 (Napoleon ka kɛlɛw waatila min Ɛsipaɲi to gofɛrɛneman tan san fila kɔnɔ)..."" This directly links the events of 1810 to Napoleon's invasion of Spain. The French invasion destabilized the Spanish Empire, creating an opportunity for independence movements in its colonies, including Chile.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gofɛrɛneman tanɲa tun bɛ yen:** While the Cortes (parliament) did exist, the text specifically connects 1810 to Napoleon's actions.
* **B: Chilie tun ye sebaya sɔrɔ Ɛpaɲɔli ka:** Chile hadn't yet declared independence in 1810. It was in the early stages of the process.
* **D: Chilie tun y’a ka yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya laselikɛ:** This option doesn't align with the information provided in the text. It suggests a more direct and immediate declaration of independence, which didn't happen in 1810.



"
Mɔgɔw bɛ se ka dugu lasamanenw lasɔrɔ cogodi Liguria mara la?,"The correct answer is **A: Mobili wali batɔn la**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Siraw, tirɛnw ani batɔnw be wulakɔnɔnaw tukuɲɔgɔna, ani mɔbiliw tɛ sek'u sɔrɔ kabɔ kɔfɛ.""  This translates to: ""The roads, trains and buses are used to reach the beautiful villages, and cars are used to reach the cafes.""

Therefore, cars (mobiliw) and buses (batɔn) are used to reach Liguria.
"
Italikan na ‘Cinque Terre’ kuma kɔrɔ ye mun ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Dugu duuru**.

The text explicitly states: ""min kɔrɔ ye Dugu Duuruw..."" which translates to ""its name is Cinque Terre...""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, samara suguya jumɛn de kaɲi tɛrɛntɛnni waati cogoyaw la?","The correct answer is **A: Samara talɔn surunmaw**.

Here's why:

The text states that the water contains salts and minerals.  It also mentions that the water evaporates, leaving behind these salts.  The residue left behind is called ""samara talɔn surunmaw,"" which translates to **""salt residue""** or **""salt deposit.""**  The question asks what is left behind after the water evaporates.



Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kiranpɔn farakan samaraw (Mineral residue):** While minerals are present, the specific residue mentioned after evaporation is the salt.
*   **C: Samara talɔn jamanjanw (Water sediment):** Sediment refers to particles that settle out of water, not what's left after evaporation.
*   **D: Samara minnu milimɛtiri (1/5 puse) tanw (Salt particles (1/5 puse) in size):**  The text doesn't specify the *size* of the salt particles left behind, just that the water evaporates, leaving them.



"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen tɛ dɛmɛdo walasa ka samali taɲɛ sira gilasi manw kan nɛnɛ waati la?,"The correct answer is **B: bɛlɛ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cɛncɛn, bɛlɛ walima kɔkɔ (kiloridi de kalisiyɔmu)be yɛrɛkɛ waatidɔw la gudɔrɔn walima siraw kan walasa ka samali taɲɛ.""

This translates to: ""Therefore, calcium (calcium and chloride) are essential for the healthy growth and development of bones and teeth.""

Therefore, ""bɛlɛ"" (calcium) is the essential component for healthy bone and teeth development.  The question asks what is essential for healthy bone development when a glass of water is consumed. The passage directly links calcium to healthy bones.
"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen bɛ talikɛ tigi tigi Hawaii ni Cook Gun ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: U fila bɛɛ bɛ waatibɔnda kelen na** (The islands are located near the aforementioned islands).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Nin waatibɔnda kelen nin Hawai ye, gun ninunw be miri inafɔ """"Hawai tukuma yɔrɔ"""".""  This translates to: ""Located near Hawaii, it is called the 'Hawaii twin'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dunanjigisow baw b'u fila bɛɛ bolo** (The islands are far away from the aforementioned islands): The text clearly states they are *near* Hawaii.
* **B: Jamanaya jɔyɔrɔ t’u fila si bolo** (The islands are a long distance away):  Again, the text says they are *near* Hawaii, not far away.
* **D: Duguba t’u fila si kɔnɔ** (The islands are a short distance away): The text doesn't specify the distance as short. It only says they are located *near* Hawaii.



"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen tɛ Cook Gun ɲɛfɔ tigi tigi?,"The correct answer is **C: A dugubaw ye Rarotonga ani Aitutaki ye.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dugu tɛ Cook Island nka a dilan neno ni gun 15 ye. Gun belebelebaw ye Rarotonga ani Aitutaki ye."" which translates to ""The Cook Islands have 15 islands. The most important are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A ka dɔgɔ katɛmɛ Hawaii** (It is located near Hawaii): While the passage mentions its proximity to Hawaii, it doesn't state it's *near* Hawaii in terms of being a major defining characteristic.
*   **B: Gun kuluw dɔ do** (It is large): The passage mentions the total area, but it doesn't specify that the islands are *large* in general.
*   **D: Gun jamana in ni Hawaii jɛlen do waatibɔnda kelen na** (It is named after Hawaii because it is similar): The passage says the islands are named ""Hawai tukuma yɔrɔ"" (Hawaiian garden islands), meaning they have a similar landscape to Hawaii, but it doesn't claim it's named *after* Hawaii due to similarity.



"
Ninnu lakɛli sigiyɔrɔ jumɛn bɛ siyɔrɔ ko suguya fila di?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The passage states: ""Sirena ye lakɛli sigiyɔrɔ kelen dɔrɔn de yemin be siyɔrɔ di ani dumuni kalamaw kafara sigili kan."" This translates to ""Sirena is a guide who has a lot of experience in the forest and knows the trails well.""  The question asks who has a lot of experience guiding.

The text states: ""CafeNet El Sol be sɛbɛni minɛnikaliba baara kɛ dolari 30 la, walima dolali 10 nin tile kelen sɛbɛn ye; kunafoniw tɔw b'u Corcovado pazi kan."" This translates to ""CafeNet El Sol has a wi-fi service for $30, or $10 for an hour and a phone for travel to Corcovado."" This directly answers the question about where you can get internet access and use a card for payment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sirena:** The text mentions Sirena as a location within the park and describes its features, but it doesn't say it offers internet or payment services.
* **B: Puerto Jiménez:** Puerto Jiménez is a town near the park, but the text only mentions a Ranger Station there and doesn't state that it's a place to get internet or use cards.
* **D: La Leona:** La Leona is described as a location where some park services are established, but there's no mention of internet or payment options.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, siki nasuku jumɛn bɛ kɛ sira garo nin kan?","The correct answer is **A: Tama tama siki**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nin baara in be wele fɛnɛ ko wulakɔnɔ siki, yɔrɔmunu mununi siki walima tama tama siki."" This translates to: ""When the ground is dry, the grass becomes yellow, and the small plants become green.""

The question asks what *makes* the ground dry. The passage explicitly says ""Nin baara in be wele fɛnɛ ko wulakɔnɔ siki,"" meaning ""When the ground is dry, the grass becomes yellow."" Therefore, the drying of the ground is the cause of the change in the grass.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wulakɔnɔ siki:**  (Dry ground) - This is the *result* of the process, not the cause.
*   **C: Sanfɛyɛlɛli cogoya:** (Sanfɛyɛlɛli/Limbaya): This refers to a type of tree, not the reason the ground becomes dry.
*   **D: Sakidɔnkɔla ka siki kɛ:** (Sakidɔnkɔla ka siki kɛ): This refers to Sakidɔnkɔla's situation or condition, not the reason the ground becomes dry.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Tama tama siki** (The ground being dry)."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn bɛ se ka wulakɔnɔ sikikɛlaw dɛmɛ minnu bɛ fɛ ka dɔ fara teliya fanga kan?","The correct answer is **D: Sira dilaniw**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I miri siki kɛ sira inafɔ ma surunyala kuluyɛlɛ sira."" This translates to ""It is a type of tree that produces a black dye from the bark.""  The question asks what the dye is made from.  The text directly identifies the bark as producing the dye, and the bark is referred to as ""sira dilaniw"" (black dye bark).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Samaraw jalen:** This refers to the wood of the tree, not the dye.
* **B: Kɔlasaki girinma dɔ:** This refers to the green leaves, not the dye.
* **C: Cogoya ɲumanw:** This refers to the fruit of the cogoya tree, not the dye.

**Translation into English:**

""The way a child is born (with a wound/rupture), it is often associated with a wound in the mouth. Children who are brought up with a white wound are often associated with a wound in their own mouths. A special way of learning from the animal kingdom is to understand a white wound and to gain other knowledge from it. When a child is born with a white wound, they have a feeling and an understanding that the animal kingdom is meant to understand these things. They are able to learn how the feeling and understanding are connected to those who are born with wounds.""

Option B: ""Fever can be a sign of a serious illness"" - This is a general statement and doesn't directly answer *how quickly* you should seek help.

Option C: ""Fever can sometimes be a sign of a simple cold"" - This is also a general statement and doesn't address the speed of seeking medical attention.

Option D: ""Fever can be caused by a skin infection"" - This is a specific cause of fever, not about seeking medical help.

Option A: ""Fever can sometimes be a sign of a serious illness and you should seek help immediately."" - This directly answers the question by stating that a fever can indicate a serious condition and recommends seeking immediate help.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.



"
Ninnu jumɛn tun kɛli ka kan ka toye mɔgɔw fɛ nin minɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **C: K’u ka siran kow hakɛ dɔgɔya** (It's because they are looking for a way to get rid of the pests).

Here's why:

* **P (Question):** The speaker is complaining about pests (dancogola) attacking their crops and says that people who have had pest problems before are always looking for solutions.
* **Q (Question):**  The question asks *why* people who have experienced pest problems are always searching for solutions.
* **A (Incorrect):** ""Ka kɛ i n'a fɔ u tɛ yen"" (It's because they have no one to help them) - While having no one to help could be a factor, it's not the primary reason.  The text emphasizes the active *seeking* of solutions.
* **B (Incorrect):** ""Ka gɛrɛ dɔnni dɔnni"" (It's because of the lack of rain) - The text talks about pests, not rainfall.
* **C (Correct):** ""K’u ka siran kow hakɛ dɔgɔya"" (It's because they are looking for a way to get rid of the pests) - This perfectly aligns with the speaker's statement that people with previous pest problems are *always* looking for solutions.
* **D (Incorrect):** ""K’u jateminɛ yɔrɔjan fɛ"" (It's because they are thinking of their ancestors) - This is completely irrelevant to the topic.

Therefore, option C is the most logical and accurate answer.



"

Here's why:

* **P (Question):** The speaker is talking about a certain type of person who is good at storytelling (dancogola) and who is also very knowledgeable (farati).  They say that people who are good at storytelling often have a lot of knowledge.

* **Q (Question):** The question asks: ""What kind of people are knowledgeable and good at storytelling, and are they often respected?""  Essentially, asking what characteristics are associated with someone who is both knowledgeable *and* a good storyteller, and if they are admired.

* **A, B, and D** are not directly addressing the core of the question. They offer descriptions of knowledge or storytelling in isolation, or focus on material possessions, but not the combination and implied respect.

* **C** translates to: ""They are often sought after to teach and to resolve conflicts."" This directly answers the question.  Someone who is both knowledgeable and a good storyteller is likely to be someone people want to learn from and someone who is respected for their wisdom and ability to mediate.  This implies respect and being valued.



Therefore, option C best reflects the implied qualities and societal role of someone described as both knowledgeable (farati) and a good storyteller (dancogola).

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira ye, ninnu na jumɛn farati ka dɔgɔn n’a bɛɛ ye dezɛri woyasikɛla ma?","The correct answer is **D: Ka ji tiɲɛn fu hakili wasu wasu ɲininni la.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Funteni dɔn la, woyasikɛlaw be seka hakili wasu wasu ye min bena jira ola ko ji beyi (walima fɛn wɛrɛ).""  This translates to: ""The heat is strong, and it seems like it will continue to be strong (the sun is shining).""
* **The question asks:** ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira ye, ninnu na jumɛn farati ka dɔgɔn n’a bɛɛ ye dezɛri woyasikɛla ma?"" This translates to: ""Considering the current situation, what will the heat be like in the future and what will the advice of the wise person be?""
* **Option D directly answers this:** ""Ka ji tiɲɛn fu hakili wasu wasu ɲininni la"" means ""It will continue to be very hot.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Funtenima fini tanɲa sufɛ nɛnɛ bɔ don** (The heat is still strong and the sun is shining.) - This restates information from the passage but doesn't predict the future.
* **B: Ka hakili wasu wasu ye min bena jira ko ji beyi** (It will continue to be strong, the sun is shining.) -  Similar to A, it restates information but doesn't predict the future.
* **C: K’i yɛrɛ sɛgɛn fu hakili wasu wasu ɲininni la** (It will be as hot as it is now.) - This implies the heat will stay the same, which is not supported by the passage's indication that it will *continue* to be strong.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that logically follows from the passage and answers the question about the future heat.



"
Ninnu jumɛn ma kofɔ inafɔ farati sɛbɛ don dezɛri woyasikɛlaw ma?,"The correct answer is **C: Farikolo tanperatiri jiginle**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ali dezɛri kalama baw be sumaya tɔntɔn sufɛ. **Farikolo tanperatiri jiginle ye farati ba ye nin fani kalama teyi.**""  This translates to: ""Ali's hair is black. **The high temperature is the reason his hair is yellow.**""

Therefore, the high temperature is the reason for the change in Ali's hair color.

Here's why:

* The question asks ""Where are we referring to?""
* The passage clearly states that the Dominican Republic is an island country ""of the Caribbean"".
* The question is asking for the geographical region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hayitikaw (Haiti)** - Haiti is a separate country, neighboring the Dominican Republic, but the question is not asking *about* Haiti.
* **C: Taínos (Taínos)** - The Taínos were an indigenous people of the region, but the question isn't asking about them.
* **D: Ɛsipaɲɔli kaw (Spanish)** - Spain colonized the area, but the question isn't asking about the colonizers.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛn ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Kan jumɛn tun bɛ fɔ Caribes fɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Akaribe marĩ adũ maaragia mwario wa Arawakan arĩa makinyĩte kũu ĩhida rĩa 10,000 BCE...""  This translates to ""The Caribbean originally derives from the Arawakan people who inhabited this land since 10,000 BCE...""

Therefore, the Arawakan people are the ones who originally inhabited the Caribbean."
Jɔnnin bɛ sɛn lakodɔn nin mɔgɔw ladɔnniyali ye siki la ko farikolo ɲɛnajɛlan don?,"The correct answer is **A: Siki kɛba jɔnjɔnw**.

The passage explicitly states: ""minunw b'u ka konze boloda ka ben siki ma yɔrɔ kɛrɛnkɛrɛnlen dɔla. **Siki kɛba jɔnjɔnw** ye hakilina ye hakilina kɔrɔlen ba ye..."" which translates to ""I was able to create a business that made a lot of money. **The 'small business' is the basis of all bases**..."".  This directly answers the question of what kind of business the person started.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛn ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ka gɛrɛ waati jumɛn na siki lakodɔnna fɔlɔfɔlɔ inafɔ farikolo ɲɛnajɛ?","The correct answer is **C: 1861**.

The text states: ""Siki inafɔ o farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ be sekɔ ka ta fo siyɛkili 17 na, ani san 1861 kɔnɔ siki tulɔnkɛyɔrɔ fɔlɔ da yɛlɛla Norvege jamanaden dɔw fɛ Ɔsitirali kɔnɔ."" This translates to: ""The clockwork followed cycles from 17, and in 1861 the clockwork was taken to Australia by Norwegian immigrants.""
"
Ninnu jumɛn cogoya tugulen bɛ gun bɛɛ la belebele la Farafinna gun kɔrɔnfɛla fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ɛrɔpu mɔgɔ ka se (European people)**.

The passage states: ""Ɛrɔpu mɔgɔ ka se ani jagoyafaganmarali daminɛ siyɛkili 15 la, waatimina Portugal ɲɛɲininkɛla Vasco de gama ye Cape Route sira ye kabɔ Erɔpu ka ta Inde."" This translates to: ""European people began to travel in large numbers around the 15th century, with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opening a sea route to India.""

Therefore, Europeans were the ones who started traveling to Africa, especially the region of Farafina (present-day Senegal).



"
Mun tɛ farafinna gun kɔrɔnfɛla gun dɔgɔmanw taamasiyɛn ye? ,"The correct answer is **A: Jɛɲɔgɔnya dɔ faransi fɛ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gun fitiniw camaw ye yɛrɛmahɔrɔn jamanaw ye, walima tugulen Faransi la, ani kodɔnlen no inafɔ kɔkɔjida ɲɛmanbaw yɔrɔw.""  This translates to: ""The age of discovery was during the age of colonialism, especially by the French, and their ships were used for the slave trade.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions the French's involvement in the slave trade. Options B, C, and D are not supported by the text.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛn ni tɛmɛsira in ye, pakiseli bɛ kɛ cogo di kerecɛn laadala kɛrɛnkɛrɛnlen tigi alabatoso dɔw bolo?","The correct answer is **C: Ka tilema ɲɛnajɛ labɛn kerecɛn jama ye** (They print and distribute religious materials to Christian communities).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Awɔ Kiretiyɛn ya dinɛ ɲɛfɔliw beyi nin lada in kan, nka o be seka kɛ fɛnɛ ka kon Kiretiyɛnya nali pirɛntan ani ɲɛli sarakabɔ ye."" This translates to: ""They [the people of Pakistan] are known to be generous and they are keen to help those in need, so they readily print and distribute religious materials to Christians.""

* **Option C directly reflects this action:**  ""Ka tilema ɲɛnajɛ labɛn kerecɛn jama ye"" means ""They print and distribute religious materials to Christian communities.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Densɔrɔ alabato jɔli (The population is large):**  While Pakistan has a large population, the passage doesn't focus on population size.
* **B: Ka sibirisu ɲɛnamali jatigiya (They are building places of worship):** The passage mentions printing and distributing materials, not building churches.
* **D: Ka tilebɔ lajɛ (They are collecting donations):** The passage focuses on *distributing* materials, not collecting donations.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Cuba jamanadenw Ameriki Green Card be minunw bolo kan ka tagabɔ Equateur lasigidenso la walasa ka jɛn sɔrɔ kabɔ nin laɲini in ma."" This translates to ""Cuban citizens can obtain an American Green Card to come to Ecuador and then obtain residency.""
* **The question asks:** How can a foreign citizen obtain Cuban citizenship to come to Ecuador?  The passage doesn't say they *can* obtain Cuban citizenship, only that they can *get a Green Card* and then *reside* in Ecuador.
* **Option A is the only one that reflects the information given:** The passage says the process takes approximately 6 months to obtain a Green Card.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sariya siratigɛla weleli bataki:** (The immigration process is very difficult) The passage doesn't indicate the process is difficult, just that it takes time.
* **C: Taanikasegin taama sɛbɛn mun bɛ taama janya jira:** (The process is very fast) This contradicts the passage stating it takes around 6 months.
* **D: Amerikɛn jamana don binkɛnɛ sɛbɛn:** (American citizens have a special process) The passage is specifically about *Cuban* citizens.



"
Ecuador taama sariyaw ma labɛn mun kama?,"The answer is **D: K’i hakililatigɛ jamana donni sɛbɛnw numanya kan** (It's a problem with the current immigration system).

Here's why:

The text describes Ecuador's efforts to attract Cuban citizens by offering pathways to residency and even a Green Card. This indicates that the current immigration system is likely restrictive or doesn't adequately cater to the needs of people seeking to migrate. The challenges mentioned (legalizing coffee, attracting skilled workers, and issues with passports and travel) all point to flaws and difficulties within the existing system.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ka taamadenw hakɛ to dɔgɔmanna** (It's a problem with economic development): While economic issues can influence migration, the text focuses more on immigration *policies* than general economic development.
*   **B: Ka taamaden jamakulu to dalakɛnyɛnnen** (It's a problem with social inequalities): Similar to A, social inequalities might play a role, but the core issue presented is about immigration systems and policies.
*   **C: Ka taamadenw ka taama janya sɛmɛntiya** (It's a problem with current political tensions): The text doesn't explicitly mention political tensions as a driver of Ecuador's immigration policies.



"
Ninnu na jumɛn sɔngɔ bɛ caya walijamanakɔnɔ ka tɛmɛ faso Kan?,"The correct answer is **A: Ɲɛkili sɛgɛsɛgɛli (Insurance companies)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how insurance companies (ninnu na jumɛn sɔngɔ) help people recover financially after a disaster, covering damages to their homes and belongings.  The question asks who helps people financially after a disaster. Therefore, the answer is insurance companies (Ɲɛkili sɛgɛsɛgɛli).
"
Mun bɛ sɛn ka na nin nunɛti kala dakabana sannin ye yɛrɛyɛrɛ walijamana kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ɲɛkili sɛgɛsɛgɛli wɛrɛ bɛ sɔn ka wajibiya** (It is a mandatory obligation to pay the insurance).

Here's why:

The passage states that lunettes (glasses) are a necessary item for many people with vision problems, and that insurance companies provide coverage for them. The question asks about the reason people need to get glasses.  The passage explicitly says that getting glasses is a **mandatory obligation** (wajibiya) if you have vision problems, to see well.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Furasansɛbɛn tɛna sɔn ka bɛn nunɛti kala dɔw ma** (The insurance company pays for the glasses) - While the passage mentions insurance, the core point isn't about the insurance company *paying* but about the *need* for the glasses.
* **C: U bɛ sɔn ka kɛ ladegen ye** (It is paid in installments) - The passage doesn't mention payment in installments.
* **D: A bɛ sɛn ka kɛ asuransi tɛna jɔ musaka kɔrɔ** (It is paid through insurance and a contribution) - While insurance *might* be involved, the passage emphasizes the *need* for the glasses due to vision problems, not specifically the financial method of payment.



"
"ka tali kɛ nin wari labaara ye Falklands, mankutu jumɛn tɛ tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **C: Falkland pounds ka kan ka falen i kɛlen kɔ ka gun bila.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Falklands dugu waari ye Falkland pound ye (FKP) min walɛri tugulen no British pound walɛrila (GBP)."" This means the Falklands use their own currency, the Falkland Pound, which is pegged to the British Pound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Warita karati nin angilɛ liwuru dɔrɔn bɛ minɛ kɔfɛ gunw kan:** While the passage mentions credit cards and the British Pound, it doesn't say that *only* credit cards are used.
* **B: Stanley yɔrɔ dɔrɔn dɛ bɛna lamerikɛn dolari minɛ:** The passage mentions that US dollars are accepted in Stanley, but it doesn't state that they are the primary currency there.
* **D: Falkland pound bɔlen a la, British pound y wari ye sɔn kɛlen do min na kosɛbɛ:** The passage clarifies that the Falkland Pound is *pegged* to the British Pound, not that the British Pound is a secondary currency.

The text states: ""Waari be seka falen banki kelen dɔrɔn de la gunw kɔnɔ min be Stanley kɔnɔ ka tɛmɛ kabɔ FIC West butiki kɔnɔ."" This translates to: ""The currency is issued by the Falkland Islands Monetary Authority, which has a branch in Stanley called FIC West bank.""

Therefore, FIC West bank is the entity responsible for issuing the Falkland Pound.
"
Lajɛrɛ jumɛn tɛ danbe ka taa alabatoso ɲɛnajɛw ma?,"The correct answer is **A: Samadenni ka wololi**.

Here's why:

The text describes *tanpulu camaw* (temples) as places where people go to pray to the spirits (San Fɛti) for various reasons – for anniversaries, weddings, or to ask for blessings.  It then mentions that these temples are often built with good materials, including wood, and adorned with images of ancestors and other spiritual figures.

The question asks: ""Where do people go to pray to the spirits?""

The text states that people go to temples (tanpulu) to pray to the spirits (San Fɛti).  Therefore, the answer is **Samadenni ka wololi** (the place of worship).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Alabatoso sanyɛlɛmaseli** (The sacred place of the ancestors): While ancestors are important in the context of temples, the text doesn't exclusively focus on ancestral worship. Temples are for praying to *all* spirits, not just ancestors.
* **C: Deity ka bangedon** (The dwelling place of deities): The text refers to ""spirits"" (San Fɛti), not necessarily ""deities"" in the traditional sense.
* **D: Lajɛrɛbaw alabatoso la** (The sacred place of the worshippers): This describes the place where people worship, but not the specific name for that place.



"
Sama masirilenw bɛ ye yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **A: Yɔrɔ bɛɛ ka daminɛ Nowanburukalo laban na ka ta bila Mɛ kalo camancɛ la**.

Here's why:

The question (Q) asks ""What are the materials of the temple?"" The answer (A) directly addresses this by stating ""The materials are the same as those used in the Newburukalo ceremony..."" (translated). The text in the question states that the temple is built with the same materials as the Newburukalo ceremony.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tanpuluw kɔno (The temple itself)** - This doesn't answer the question of *what it's made of*.
* **C: Mɔgɔw ni bagan ɲɔgɔn nɔfɛ Tanpulu fɛtuw la (Men and women who participate in the temple ceremony)** - This refers to the *people* involved, not the materials.
* **D: Karela bɔlɔnw kɔnɔ (The golden colors)** - While the text mentions ""golden colors"" as a feature of the temple, it doesn't say *those are the only* materials.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Kabuni cia ndege nĩciũĩ ni kũrĩ andũ meharĩirie kũrĩha mbeca nyingĩ nigetha mathiĩ ihenya na mwĩgangaro, na makarĩhia ũrĩa kwagĩrĩire."" (Airline cabins have more space for passengers to relax and enjoy comfort, and offer superior service). This implies higher costs.
* **The question asks:** Why are first and business class tickets more expensive?
* **Option C directly answers this:**  First class tickets are more expensive *and* offer more amenities (more comfort and superior service), justifying the higher price.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka wari sara i ka cakɛda ka sira fɛ** (It depends on the ticket price). While ticket prices vary, the core reason for the difference isn't *just* the price. It's what you get for the price.
* **B: Ka first class tike mara sanni i k’a kɛ business class ta ye** (First class tickets are always more expensive than business class). This is a generalization and not necessarily true. The difference can vary depending on the airline and route.
* **D: Ka sɔngɔnjigi ɲini** (That's a coincidence).  The price difference is not a coincidence; it's a result of the value and amenities offered.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de ɲinini ye yɛrɛlasumaya ye ni bɛ pankun tike dɔw mara?","The correct answer is **B: Business class**.

Here's why:

* The text discusses the price difference between business class and economy class, mentioning business class costs 80% more than economy. It also mentions first class costing 111% more than economy.
* The question asks what kind of ticket is typically purchased by people who can afford the higher prices.
* The text implies that business and first class are often purchased by those who can afford to pay more for comfort and space.

Therefore, the most logical answer based on the text is **Business class**. The phrase ""pankurun minnu bɛ tilen u tayɔrɔ la"" in the answer is likely a transcription or phonetic rendering of ""Business class.""



"
Mun de man kan ka jate ni tike wari faralen ɲɔgɔnkan ka taa farafinna n’o bɛ suma ni diɲɛ tuuru kɛli tike wari ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Farafinna wiza wari**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kana ɲina ka wiza waari fara depansi wɛrɛ kan, tali takisi, tuma tiransipɔri, dɔ wɛrɛ nin yɔrɔ ninunw bɛɛla Farafina kɔfɛ.""  This translates to: ""Or, people can use airport visas, taxis, public transport, etc., to travel to the airport.""  Since the question asks about *expensive* travel options, and the text mentions ""wiza waari fara depansi"" (airport visas) as an option alongside taxis and other transport, it implies that airport visas are considered an expensive way to get to the airport.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, sipɛri-marisew ye bɛ k’a daminɛ ka fɛn juman yɔrɔ caman bila senka?","The correct answer is **A: Dumuni dilannenw kaban**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What kind of things do supermarisels use to carry things in bags?"" (translated)
* **The text states:** ""Sipɛrimarisew be seka dumuni dilaninw ka ban yɔrɔ camaw bila sekan."" (Supermarisels use things that are always with them to carry things in bags.)
* **""Dumuni dilannenw kaban""** translates to ""Things that are always with them"". This directly answers the question about what supermarisels use to carry things.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Furudeniw** (Words) - The text doesn't mention supermarisels using words to carry things.
* **C: Dumuni kɛyɔrɔ kelen** (Small things) - While they might use small things, the text emphasizes that they use things *always with them*.
* **D: Piri danɔgɔ** (Strong ropes) - The text mentions ropes being used for some things, but not specifically as what supermarisels use to carry things in bags.



"
Sipɛri-marise bɛ minɛw nafama juman di n’o bɛ se ka ja dilannen sanbaga dɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Dumuni kɛyɔrɔ kelen**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What are the things that supermarines are capable of using to travel?
* **The text states:** ""Dugu walima butiki dɔw la, dumuni kɛyɔrɔ kelen dɔ be sɔrɔyi, waatidɔw la kodɔnbali dɔ sariya siratigɛ piri danɔgɔla..."" This translates to: ""The sturdy shell of the turtle is what they use to travel in the waters, with a very strong, large, and smooth shell...""
* **Therefore, ""Dumuni kɛyɔrɔ kelen"" (The sturdy shell of the turtle)** is the answer to the question about what supermarines use for travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yɔrɔ dɔgɔman (Large waves):** The text describes the shell, not waves.
* **C: Dumuni minnu dilan (Small things):**  This is the opposite of what the text describes - a sturdy, large shell.
* **D: Furudeni (Speed):** The text doesn't mention speed as a means of travel. It focuses on the shell.



"
Nin fɛn juman kelen tɛ se ka famuya Belgique ani Suise faranfɛsɔlaw?,"The correct answer is **A: Faranse nɔrɔmali jate cogoya** (Standard French and colloquial French).

The passage states: ""Belgique ani Suisse faransɛfɔlaw bena seka faransɛ nɔrɔmali kalan kalansola, ola u bena sek'i famuya ali nin i ye faransɛ nɔrɔmali jate cogoya itilize."" This translates to: ""Belgian and Swiss French speakers use standard French with some colloquial French.""

Therefore, the common element used by French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland is **standard French combined with colloquial French**.
"

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the common language between French and Belgium or Switzerland?""
* **The text states:** ""Belgique ani Suisse faransɛfɔlaw bena seka faransɛ nɔrɔmali kalan kalansola, ola u bena sek'i famuya ali nin i ye faransɛ nɔrɔmali jate cogoya itilize.""  This translates to: ""The French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is the standard French, or it is a mixture of standard French and the local French.""

Therefore, the common language is standard French. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they refer to different concepts.



"
Lahalaya kelen juman na sudɔni wari tɛ d’i ma?,"The correct answer is **B: N’I ye tike maralikɛ dirɛkiteman ni pankurun ye sani i ka kɛ cɛmamɔgɔ ka sira fɛ**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Cogoya bɛɛ la, i kan ka tike maralikɛ dirɛkiteman nin pankuruso ye u ka nɛgɛjuru sifa fɛ."" This translates to ""However, it can be through connecting flights or airlines that offer a direct route.""  Option B directly reflects this statement, explaining that connecting flights or airlines with direct routes are possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: N'i bɛ ka ta WestJet pankurun na:**  The text mentions WestJet as an airline *that* operates, but it doesn't say it's the only or the most likely way to travel.
* **C: N’i bɛ ka ta Lufthansa pankuruso fɛ ka bɔ Paris ka ta Ameriki:** While Lufthansa flies to America, the text doesn't specify a connection *through Paris*.
* **D: Ni bɛ ka ta Delta pankurunso fɛ:** Similar to WestJet, Delta is mentioned as an airline but not presented as the definitive answer to *how* one can travel.



"
Mun ye tiɲɛ ye sudɔni wari kunkan?,"The correct answer is **D: U ka kan tike lamara dɛrɛkitiman pankurunso ka nɛgɛjurusira fɛ.**

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Cogoya bɛɛ la, i kan ka tike maralikɛ dirɛkiteman nin pankuruso ye u ka nɛgɛjuru sifa fɛ.""  This translates to: ""However, it can also find tickets through travel agents or airlines that offer fares.""

Option D accurately reflects this statement. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U bɛ sudɔni wari di** - This translates to ""It is a travel agency."" While Cogoya *is* a travel agency, this isn't the most specific answer to the question.
* **B: U ka kan ka lamara dɛrɛkitiman pankurunso ka** - This translates to ""It can find travel agents for airlines."" This is not quite right, the sentence implies Cogoya finds tickets *through* agents or airlines, not just finds agents for airlines.
* **C: U bɛ teliya woyasi wari di** - This translates to ""It is a flight booking agency."" While related, this is not as accurate as option D, as it doesn't mention the possibility of finding tickets through travel agents or airlines directly.



Therefore, option D is the most precise and accurate answer based on the provided text.

Waati juman GPS jɔlen a yɛrɛ ye o utilizeli bɛ se ka kɛ sira lafiyalen ye ka tɛmɛ yɔrɔɲini GPS apilikasiyɔn kan?,"The correct answer is **A: Waati min ’i bɛ ka lajɛ ka wari mara** (The power to use a smartphone is to have a strong battery).

Here's why:

The passage states that GPS functionality on a smartphone uses a lot of power.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Waati min i dan b’a la ko ɛntɛrinɛti keredi bɛ na k’i kun** (The power is from the internet credit). While internet is used, the primary power drain for GPS is the device's battery.
* **C: Waati ti min i bɛ talen yɔrɔ la a tɛ sɔn yɔrɔ min** (The power is from the user's data). The user's data isn't the power source.
* **D: Waati min i tɛ fɛ ka baara masin dɔ luwanse** (The power is from the device's sound). Sound isn't related to GPS power consumption.

The passage specifically links GPS usage to battery drain (""walima GPS jɔlen a yɛrɛ ye walima kelen luweli mɔbili luwe baarakɛɛda dɔ fɛ"" -  the power of the GPS function is the power that drains the smartphone's battery quickly). Therefore, a strong battery is necessary for extended GPS use.

The text states: ""Nin ɛntɛrɛnɛti kiredi t'i kun telefɔnila, walima nin a tɛ sɔn o yɔrɔla, u ka baarakaɲɛ be ka dɔgɔya walima tɛ sɔrɔ."" This translates to: ""And with mobile internet credit on the phone, it allows you to search and access information.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Wari marali** (Mobile data) - While related, the text specifically mentions ""ɛntɛrɛnɛti keredi"" (internet credit), which is a more common term for mobile internet access in many contexts.
*   **C: K’i yɛrɛ kisi singan ma** (It uses any single one) - The text implies a specific type of internet access.
*   **D: Mako jɔbaliya kariti kura sani na** (It uses a mobile credit card) - The text mentions ""ɛntɛrɛnɛti keredi"" (internet credit) and not necessarily a credit card.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye,cogoya juman na i bɛ se ka danganiya sɔrɔ k’i bɛnna batɔn hakika ma?","The correct answer is **C: Ka lamarali kɛ baarakɛla dɔ fɛ min ye Galapagos woyasi ɲɛdɔnba ye.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the reason for the unique characteristics of the Galapagos finches?
* **The text states:** Charles Darwin observed these finches on the Galapagos Islands in 1835 and noted that there were 10 different species, with each species having a beak adapted to a different food source. He believed these finches were descended from a common ancestor and had evolved to suit the different environments of the Galapagos Islands.

Option C directly reflects this information: the finches' unique beaks are a result of adaptation to the different environments of the Galapagos Islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka kulu dɔ tike lamara taamaden 8+ walima u kan ka can n’o ye o bɛ min kɔnɔ wa minnu ka laɲiniw ka surun ɲɔgɔn na:** This option refers to the number of finch species and doesn't explain *why* they are unique.
* **B: Ka lamarali kɛ sɔngɔ ka nɔgɔn waati min:** This option is unclear and doesn't relate to the text.
* **D: Ka lamaralikɛ waati jan kɔnɔ:** This option is also unclear and doesn't align with the information about adaptation to different food sources.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛn juman kelen tɛ utilize nafɔ fɛrɛ min b’a to zuwekelaw bɛ to zuwe la?","The correct answer is **B: Nɛgɛnikalanw inafɔ wari te sara ka tike minnu san.**

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P) describes a situation where the Kazonow are facing a threat from the ""minfɛnw"" (likely a hostile force). They are using technology (""finɛtiriw"" and ""monturu"") to defend themselves.**  The passage emphasizes the need to use these technologies effectively.
* **The Question (Q) asks how to utilize the technology they have to defend themselves.**
* **Option B translates to ""The mechanical devices that create noise and break the ground.""**  This aligns perfectly with the need for defensive technology to deter or disable the attacking force.  ""Noise"" could be a sonic weapon, and ""breaking the ground"" could refer to a defensive system that creates obstacles or disruptions.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Tile yelen cayali (Simple water tiles):** While water might be used in some defensive measures, simple tiles don't offer the kind of technological advantage described in the passage.
* **C: Dafalikɛ minfɛnw (Hostile minfɛnw):** This is simply a description of the enemy, not a solution to defending against them.
* **D: Mɔnturu taɲa (Bright machines):**  While the Kazonow have machines, ""bright"" doesn't convey the defensive purpose the question is asking about.


Therefore, option B best answers the question of how to utilize their technology for defense."
"Ka kɛɲe ni tɛmɛsira in ye, zuwekɛla ɲanama ka kan ka i yɛrɛ kisi mun ma?","The correct answer is **C: Ka sokɔnɔmɔnturu ni bololamɔnturu lajɛ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where the Kazonow are mobilizing and preparing for a conflict.** They are gathering weapons, training warriors, and focusing on their military capabilities.
* **The question asks what is being done to prepare for this conflict.**
* **Option C, ""Ka sokɔnɔmɔnturu ni bololamɔnturu lajɛ"" (To gather weapons and equipment), directly reflects the information provided in the passage about the Kazonow's preparations.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: K’a dɔlɔ min ka dan tɛmɛ (To wait for the right time):** The passage emphasizes immediate action and preparation, not waiting.
* **B: Ka sɔn nɛgɛsikɛlanw na (To send messengers):** While communication might be involved, the primary focus of the preparation described is on military strength.
* **D: K’i masurunyala bɔda ɲininkali kɛ (To build strong fortifications):** The passage mentions weapons and warriors, but not specifically the construction of fortifications.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, daɲɛ siyɔrɔma juman sɛbɛnnen bɛ ni siginiden kunba ye kumasen camancɛ la?","The correct answer is **A: Waleyakɛlanw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""O ye sira ɲuman ye ka waleyakɛlanw ani tɔgɔmankuntulanw danfarabɔ ɲɔgɔna."" This translates to ""It is a kind of significant thing that the people and the chiefs have done to build a good relationship.""  This directly connects ""waleyakɛlanw"" (the people) to the building of a good relationship with the chiefs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tɔgɔw (Togow):**  While Togow is mentioned in the initial phrase ""Tɔgɔw bɛɛ..."" (Togow is...), the passage doesn't attribute the building of the relationship *to* the Togow people specifically.
* **C: Mantukɛlanw (Chiefs):**  The passage states that the chiefs are involved in building the relationship, but it doesn't say they are the ones *doing* it.  It says the *people* and the chiefs are working together.
* **D: Cogoyajiralan (the significant/important things):** While the passage *describes* the relationship as a significant thing, the question asks *who* is building the relationship, not *what* the relationship is.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Tɔgɔw daminɛni ni siginidenkunba ye o bɛ se ka mun gɛlɛya kosɛba?","The correct answer is **D: Ka tɔgɔmantulanw danfara (The old people/elders)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...ali nin kumasen camancɛla. O ye sira ɲuman ye ka waleyakɛlanw ani tɔgɔmankuntulanw danfarabɔ ɲɔgɔna.""  This translates to ""...and the elders are respected. They are wise and guide the youth and the old people/elders with wisdom.""  

* **The question asks:** ""Who are the ones who guide the youth and the old people in the community?""

* **Therefore, the answer must be ""Ka tɔgɔmantulanw danfara"" (the old people/elders).**



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kalanni (Children/Youth):** The text says the elders guide the youth, not the other way around.
* **B: Ka waleyakɛlanw danfara (The youth):**  The text says the elders guide the youth, not the other way around.
* **C: Sɛbɛnni (The neighbors):** The text doesn't mention neighbors as guides.



"
"Malaysie burusikɔnɔnaw na, wale juman kɔrɔ ye “na yan”?","The correct answer is **B: Tikɛwili**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Malaisie kɔnɔ, kɔni malɛw cɛla burusi kɔnɔnaw la, o kɔrɔ ye """"na yan"""" ka surun digɛndɛnɛ deni naanina kuruli kana farikolo fanfɛ, wale min be nati Ɛrɔpu jamana dɔw kɔn, ani kan ka itilize o kun dɔrɔn de kama."" This translates to: ""Malaysia, its people, who are of Chinese origin, used the term """"na yan"""" for the entire trading activity, from the shipping of goods to the factories, which were built in the style of European times, and used their own money to manage it.""

The question asks what the term ""na yan"" referred to in relation to Malaysian Chinese traders. The passage explicitly says ""o kɔrɔ ye """"na yan"""" ka surun digɛndɛnɛ deni naanina kuruli kana farikolo fanfɛ"" - meaning ""it used the term """"na yan"""" for the entire trading activity from shipping goods to factories.""  ""Tikɛwili"" (shipping) is a key component of that trading activity.

Therefore, ""Tikɛwili"" is the most accurate answer.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, wale juman kɔrɔ be se ka kɛ “segin”?","The correct answer is **A: Tikɛwili ni tikɛkɔnɔnan sini ye ɲɛfɛ**

Here's why:

The passage says: ""Grande Bretagne woyasikɛlaw Ɛsipaɲi kɔnɔ be seka fili tikɛwili kanbɛn miny tikɛkɔnɔna silinye folibama (ka tɛmɛ tikɛ beka wili mɔgɔ mina) inafɔ seginli waleya.""

This translates to: ""Great Britain, along with Spain, used a type of weaving using a loom with a shuttle (where the shuttle had a wooden or metal base) to produce cloth in a more regular and efficient manner.""

The word ""seginli"" (in the context) refers to the **regularity and efficiency** of the weaving process.  The options describe different aspects, but option A, ""Tikɛwili ni tikɛkɔnɔnan sini ye ɲɛfɛ"" (the weaving and the shuttle were regular), best captures this meaning.  The regular weaving *is* the ""seginli.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka tigɛdenni dɔ naaninan kuru** (It was a simple and easy process): While it might have been *easier* than earlier methods, the passage emphasizes the *regularity* and *efficiency*, not just simplicity.
*   **C: Tikɛlili ni tikɛkɔnɔnan sini ye kɔfɛ** (The weaving and the shuttle were expensive): The passage doesn't mention cost.
*   **D: Kunkolo kɔmili** (A type of silk): The passage discusses cloth made from other materials.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de nɔ ye gilasisanflacili ye?","The correct answer is **A: Gulasikuru pɔnman**.

Here's why:

* The question asks: ""What is the reason why glass is so useful?""
* The text states: ""Gilasikuru pɔnan manw ye."" which translates to ""Glass is useful because it is strong.""
* Therefore, the reason glass is useful is its strength (gulasikuru pɔnman).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gulasi kulu basikibaliw** - This translates to ""Glass is easily broken."" This is the *opposite* of why glass is useful.
* **C: Kuluwokɔnɔ dilasikulu binnin** - This is unclear and doesn't relate to the reason for glass's usefulness.
* **D: Gulasi kulu binnen** - This translates to ""Glass is heavy."" While glass *can* be heavy, the text doesn't mention weight as a reason for its usefulness.  Strength is emphasized.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛn ni temɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛnw bi se ka dogo gilasikuru pɔnan manw fɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Gilasikuru bele beleba**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""What is the cause of the smallness of the glass bottle?"" The text states: ""Gilasikuru bele beleba sanfɛlala be ci fitini, ka ben ani lala ka pan walima ka kɔnlɔnkɔnlɔn yɔrɔjan kabɔ sanfɛlala."" This translates to ""Small glass bottles are caused by a flaw, which causes them to be warped and unable to be used for storing liquids.""

Therefore, the smallness (bele beleba) of the glass bottles is *caused by* the flaw (fitini).
"
"Ka da ni temɛsira in ye, taamadenw ka kan jantoyɛrɛla wɛrɛw ta ka kɔn yɔrɔ jumɛn lajɛli?","The correct answer is **A: Nyiragongo takulu** (Nyiragongo volcano).

The question asks what *caused* the destruction of Goma. The text identifies the Nyiragongo volcano as the cause.
"
Ninnu jumɛn te ladilikan ɲuman ye turisi ma Goma?,"The correct answer is **B: Yɔrɔ ɲuman do w’a sɔgɔma ca Kulukan Gow ka Sira ka**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Moto takisiw ye fɛrɛ ɲuman ye ka s’i seyɔrɔ la."" This translates to ""Taxi fares are around 500 Congolese Francs.""
* **Option B** accurately reflects this information by mentioning the cost of a taxi.
* **Option A** refers to the overall situation in Kivu Province, which isn't about tourist fares.
* **Option C** talks about a specific type of vehicle (motorcycle), not taxis, and the fare is not mentioned.
* **Option D** discusses the Nyiragongo volcano, but not related to tourist fares or transportation.

"
Labɛn jumɛn be sena Kaniɲɔn lakanan na?,"The correct answer is **B: Yamaruyaw bi senna Zanwuyekalo 1ɔlɔ dama**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes the Grand Canyon backcountry permits.** It states the permits are required for overnight trips and are needed for trips from the 1st of the month to the end of the month.
* **Option B translates to:** ""They are obtained from the Grand Canyon National Park."" This aligns with the information in the text about needing a permit *from* the park.
* **Options A, C, and D are incorrect:**
    * **A:** ""They are obtained from the Grand Canyon River."" This is nonsensical.
    * **C:** ""They are obtained from the Park Service office."" While the Park Service might be involved, the text specifically mentions the Grand Canyon National Park.
    * **D:** ""They are not obtained."" This contradicts the entire premise of the text.



"
Ninnu jumɛn de b’inafɔ sɔrɔli ka dɔgɔ ninnu dunanjigisow nasugu minnu ɲɛfɔlendon ni tɛmɛsiran in na?,"The correct answer is **A: Negelafɛn minkɛyɔrɔ** (Neglected minority).

Here's why:

The text describes how the hotel was built to accommodate a marginalized group – those who were ""neglected minorities"" (negelafɛn minkɛyɔrɔ). It states the hotel was intended to provide them with basic necessities and a place to live with dignity. The description emphasizes that the hotel was built *specifically* for this group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dumunimɔgɔ ka dumunikɛyɔrɔ** (Majority group and minority group): While the hotel serves a minority, the text doesn't focus on the dynamics *between* majority and minority groups.
* **C: Tɔɲɔgɔn dunanw minnu dɔn bɛ ka ɲɛn walima lakodɔnnen** (Those who were previously deprived of basic necessities): While the hotel aims to provide necessities, the text highlights the group's previous neglect, not just deprivation.
* **D: So labɛnnenw sisannen ni labɛn minɛ kuraw ye** (Those who are socially disadvantaged and have no status): While there's overlap, the text emphasizes the specific case of neglected minorities and their need for a place to live with dignity.

Therefore, **A: Negelafɛn minkɛyɔrɔ** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text."
"ka da ni kunnafoni fɔlen ye ni tɛmɛsira in na, ninnu sɔnfɛn jumɛn bina diyanye bi se ka dɔgɔya dunanjigiso dunaw ye?","The correct answer is **C: Sufɛ ɲanajɛ kɛli ɲanajɛli kɛyɔrɔla dunanjigiso la**.

Here's why:

The text describes the hotel's facilities, including air conditioning, equipment, and water supply. It also mentions that the hotel is equipped with modern communication systems and provides a comfortable environment for guests.

The question asks what the hotel offers in terms of ""unforgettable experiences"" that guests can enjoy.  The phrase ""Sufɛ ɲanajɛ kɛli ɲanajɛli kɛyɔrɔla dunanjigiso la"" translates to ""Offering unforgettable experiences with modern amenities."" This option directly addresses the question by highlighting the hotel's focus on creating memorable stays through its features.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Minɛ kɔrɔw yɔrɔ fan bɛɛ** (The hotel is beautiful): While the hotel might be beautiful, this doesn't directly answer the question about unforgettable experiences.
* **B: Dumunikɛyɔrɔ ni tobili kɛla wanɛ** (A comfortable and clean place):  Comfort and cleanliness are important, but the question asks for *unforgettable experiences*, which go beyond basic needs.
* **D: So minnu da kadi** (It's really good): This is a subjective statement and doesn't describe what the hotel *offers* to create unforgettable experiences.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and complete answer to the question.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de ma kan ka kɛ Greenland lajɛli taamakɛlaw fɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Greenland ka weleli inafɔ “Eskimo”**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...The term ""Eskimo"" is often used, although it is considered outdated."" This directly answers the question of what term Greenlanders often use to refer to themselves. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn b’inafɔ gɛlɛya Greenland lajɛli taamakɛla labɛnbaliw fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Nɔridiki sosow (Nordique sosow)**.

The text states: ""Tile janba tilema fɛ be seka sunɔkɔbaliya kaɲɛ kunbalan nati ani kɛnɛya kunbalanw. Tilema waatila, janto fɛnɛ Nordique sosow la."" This translates to: ""The tiles are made of a material that is a mixture of natural and synthetic materials. The tiles are water-resistant, and are made in the Nordic countries."" Therefore, the tiles are made in the Nordic countries.



"
Ninnu jumɛn bi ka labaara sisan inafɔ jamankafoyɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Jardin de la Union. Nin yɔrɔ in dilana inafɔ masabɔndayɛlɛlen siyɛkili 17 dine yɔrɔ fɛ, minunw na Templo de San Diego kelen dɔrɔn de ye so balolen ye. **A be baara bibi in na inafɔ jamankafoyɔrɔ...**""

This directly translates to: ""Jardin de la Union. It is a place where people gather every day, next to the San Diego Temple. **It is a place where people gather...**"" Therefore, the Jardín de la Unión is the place where people gather.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn ma sɔrɔ Jardín de la Unión kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Central Gazebo ni konsɛriw**.

The text states: ""Dumuni kɛyɔrɔ dama damaniw be zariden gɛrɛfɛlara, ani tileganiw fɛ ani sufɛ konsɛriw fulama be kɛ yi kabɔ Central Gazebo fɛ."" This translates to ""The people enjoy the garden's green spaces, and there is a large fountain and a beautiful fountain in the Central Gazebo."" Therefore, the Central Gazebo and the fountain are highlighted as important features.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the impact of technology (specifically telephones) on society.** It mentions how telephones connect people across distances, facilitate communication, and change the way people interact and conduct business. 
* **The question asks how technology (telephones) can be used to improve communication and understanding between people.**
* **Option A directly addresses this by stating that telephones allow for communication across distances.** This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of how telephones connect people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Janyaw bi yɛlɛma, nka u ka kan ka bɛɛ taama tile kelen kɔnɔ (People are clever, so they can use technology in new ways).** While true, this is a general statement and doesn't specifically answer *how* telephones improve communication.
* **C: Mɔgɔ min galabu ka kɛnɛ hakɛyala a ka c’a la olu kan ni wale diyabɔ (People who are wealthy can afford to buy and use technology).** This speaks to access, not the functionality of the technology in improving communication.
* **D: Tilefɛtaama tɛ kɛnɛma wale ɲuman ye denbayaw minw bɛ nin den denyɛrɛninw ye (Telephones are a tool for people and businesses to communicate).** This is a true statement, but it's a general definition rather than a specific answer to *how* they improve communication and understanding.

Here's why:

* **The text describes a scenario where someone lost their phone.** It mentions searching in various places like the factory, the road, and asking people for help.
* **The question asks where the people were looking for the phone.**
* **The text explicitly states that people were searching for the phone in the market (""mɔgɔ min galabu ka kɛnɛ hakɛyala be sek'o kɛ nisondiyala"" - people were looking for it and asking for help).**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na bɛ talikɛ sira nɔgɔman na** (They were looking for the phone among the people). While people were involved in the search, the text doesn't specifically say they were looking *among* the people in a general sense.
* **C: Na sɔrɔ denmisɛnw bi ta taama na** (They were following the phone's signal). The text mentions using a signal to track the phone, but doesn't say they were actively *following* it in real-time.
* **D: Na sɔrɔ taama bi kɛ kunkokɔnɔnaw l** (They were following the phone's location). Similar to C, while location was tracked, the text doesn't specify active real-time following.



"
Mun de bɛ Rogaland walima Agder kulujanw danfara ka bɔ Nɔriwɛzi ta tɔw ma?,"The correct answer is **D: A datugulendo waatidɔw la nin biriyɛri ye.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Do people from Rogaland or Agder go to Norway to work?""
* **The text states:** ""Rogaland ani Agder kɔnɔ, u be wele waaticama ko """"hei"""" min kɔrɔ ye ko filemayɔrɔ jididan min datugulen dɔn waatidɔw la nin biriyɛri ye.""
* **Translation of the relevant sentence:** ""People from Rogaland and Agder go to the north to work and to find opportunities for a better life.""

Therefore, option D accurately reflects the information provided in the text. It states that people from these regions go to the north *to work and find opportunities for a better life*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jiriw b’u fɛ** (They don't go) - This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **B: Jidigɛn foyi tɛ ye** (They are immigrants) - While some might be considered immigrants, the text focuses on them going *to work*, not necessarily permanent immigration.
* **C: A c’a la kulujanw kɛɲɛnnendo** (It is the work of the regions) - This doesn't directly address whether people *go* to Norway for work.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn tun tese ka kɛ Nɔriwɛzi cogoya ye?","The correct answer is **A: Yɔrɔ kɛnɛjɛ ba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rogaland ani Agder kɔnɔ, u be wele waaticama ko """"hei"""" min kɔrɔ ye ko filemayɔrɔ jididan min datugulen dɔn waatidɔw la nin biriyɛri ye."" This translates to: ""Rogaland and Agder are known for the 'hei' that is the place of the Norwegian people and the film industry that is the center of the country.""

Therefore, ""Yɔrɔ kɛnɛjɛ ba"" (the place of the Norwegian people) is the correct answer as it refers to what Rogaland and Agder are known for in Norway.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kulujan tufinnen** (The language of the people): While the passage is in a local language, the question asks about what *regions* of Norway are known for something.
*   **C: Jidigɛnw** (The old people): The passage doesn't mention old people.
*   **D: Filemayɔrɔw** (The film industry): While the passage mentions the film industry, it doesn't state it as the primary reason Rogaland and Agder are known. The passage emphasizes the place of the Norwegian people.



"
Waati jumɛn turisiw tun b’u mako don siki lajɛlila kulumayɔrɔw la?,"The correct answer is **B: Yɛlɛ waaticama waatila**.

Here's why:

The question asks *what* tourists are interested in seeing in the Kulumayɔrɔsow area. The passage states: ""Kulumayɔrɔsow sɔw lajɛli waati be yɛlɛ waaticama Inde tilema waatila.""  This translates to: ""The Kulumayɔrɔsow area is popular for tourists to see Indian-style temples and shrines.""

Therefore, tourists are interested in seeing **Indian-style temples and shrines**. Option B, ""Yɛlɛ waaticama waatila,"" accurately reflects this.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, turisiw ka ca waati jumɛn kosɔbɛ kulumayɔrɔ la?","The correct answer is **B: Nɛzisanfɛpani ɲɛnɛjɛ waati bɛɛ kɔnɔ**

* **The text states:** ""...kulumayɔrɔsow camaw kɛniye ka nɛzi ɲuman baw sɔrɔ ani farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ bilale senkan inafɔ siki and nɛzisanfɛpani."" This translates to ""...the cotton growers themselves are able to earn money and create factories that produce textiles and other products.""
* **The question asks:** ""If this is the case, how do tourists visit the cotton farms?"" This is asking about the reason *why* tourists visit the cotton farms.
* **Option B** directly addresses this by stating that tourists visit the cotton farms because they are interested in the textile production and the factories.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nɛzi ba waatila** (They visit to see the cotton) - While true, it doesn't explain the *reason* for the visit, only *what* they see.
* **C: Ɛndi tilema waatila** (It is a textile industry) - This is a general statement about the industry, not about why tourists specifically visit the farms.
* **D: Nɛnɛ kalow bɛɛ kɔnɔ** (It is a beautiful place) -  While the farms might be beautiful, the text focuses on the economic activity and the connection to the textile industry.

Therefore, **B** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
I man kan ka mun kɛ ni bi ka dɛmɛn ɲini bato fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka taama ka ta ka segin dɔnisarize yɔrɔw la**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fitinifɔlila, i bena kunafoni bila dɛmɛdilila, nin dɔnisarize yɔrɔ tamali..."" This translates to: ""Finally, it has a telephone that can dial and transmit information...""
* **The question asks:** ""How can one make a call?""
* **Option A directly addresses this:**  ""Ka taama ka ta ka segin dɔnisarize yɔrɔw la"" translates to ""One can use the telephone to transmit information."" This implies using the phone to make a call.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka kapitɛniw k’i teriye** (The captain will answer) -  This describes who might answer, not *how* to make a call.
* **C: I ka baarakɛtaw gaseli** (The radio operator will answer) - Similar to B, this describes who might answer, not *how* to make a call.
* **D: K’i tɔɲɔngɔ bato ɲinin na ye k’u to yi** (The people who are the same will go to it) - This is a nonsensical option and doesn't relate to making a phone call.

* **The question asks:** ""What kind of people benefit from the use of these devices?""
* **The passage explicitly mentions:** ""kumaɲininlila mɔgɔw jisanfɛ baarakɛlaw fɛ minɛnfɛn miriyɔrɔla"" -  ""for people with hearing impairments.""

Therefore, the option that best reflects who benefits is **A: Kumaɲinanlili jisanfɛ mɔgɔ baarakɛlaw fɛ** (Sign language for people with hearing impairments).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka to radari jukɔrɔ** (To have a small camera) - While some devices might have cameras, it's not the primary benefit mentioned.
* **C: Gɛlɛ mɔgɔw la dɔrɔn k'u t’u ka yaciw jɔsi la** (People who like to listen to stories) - The device allows deaf people to listen, but it's not specifically for people who like stories.
* **D: I mabɔ i tɔɲɔngɔ bato ɲininnaw la** (Those who are the most important people) - The device benefits a broader range of people, not just the ""most important.""



"
Yɔrɔ jumɛn bɛ turisi sama ka ta gun ka kolonizasiyɔn tariku ma?,"The correct answer is **C: Hong Kong dugukɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hong Kong dugu fan baw yɔrɔ dilan ne faraleno ɲɔgɔnkan cogoyala dugukolo ɲininlen kan jidala.""  This translates to ""Hong Kong's history is full of colonialism and is particularly rich in the history of the colonial era.""  ""Dugukɔnɔ"" refers to the history or narrative of a place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jida kɛɲɛkanyanfan:** This translates to ""The era of the 1980s"" and is not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Kowloon jibolo min ɲɛsinen do:** This translates to ""The Kowloon peninsula"" which is mentioned as a place where guns were hidden, but not as the overarching theme of colonialism's historical impact.
*   **D: Victoria Harbor:**  Victoria Harbor is mentioned as a geographical feature where guns were hidden, but not as representing the colonialism history itself.



"
Yɔrɔ jumɛn bɛ se ka turusiw la sama min bɛ lajɛli ɲuman ba kɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Victoria Harbor**.

The text states: ""Nin be fɛka Hong Kong lajɛli ɲuman ba kɛ, gun bila ani ɲɛsin Kowloon jibolo min ɲɛsinleno a ma. **Nin be fɛka Hong Kong lajɛli ɲuman ba kɛ, Harbour Victoria jiw ka kɛli ye.**"" This translates to: ""In addition to the Hong Kong land area, the gun's range extends to Kowloon and the Victoria Harbour.""

Therefore, Victoria Harbour is the area mentioned as being part of Hong Kong's land area.
"
Fɛn jumɛn bɛ sosigilan na min bɛ dɛmɛdo ka sobolila sen balanni sendalan na k'o farati dɔgɔya?,"The correct answer is **A: Dugumala fitiniw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fɔlɔfɔlɔ, sobolila kura be soboli samara talɔn ma dɔn ani dugumala fɛkɛman ani fitinini."" This translates to ""However, the main purpose of soles is to provide grip and prevent slipping and falling.""

Therefore, the reason soles are designed to prevent slipping is to provide **grip** and prevent **falling** (dugumala fitiniw).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lakana nɛgɛw** (English soles): While the passage mentions English soles, it's not the *reason* they are designed for slip resistance.
*   **C: Golo sendalanw** (Round shoes): This is irrelevant to the function of soles.
*   **D: Sitabilite ba** (Stability): Stability is *related* to slip resistance, but not the direct reason *why* soles are designed to prevent slipping. Stability is a consequence of good grip.



"
Lahalaya jumɛn kelen bɛ soboli samara la min bɛ dɛmɛdo sobolila ka lakana ma waati min baara bɛka kɛ sendalanw na?,"The correct answer is **D: Dugumala fɛrɛlenw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sobolila kura be soboli samara talɔn ma dɔn ani dugumala fɛkɛman ani fitinini."" This translates to ""The main benefit of soles is to absorb impact and prevent injuries."" 

* **The question asks:** ""What do soles absorb to prevent injuries when walking?""

* **""Dugumala fɛrɛlenw""** translates to ""impact.""  This directly aligns with the passage's explanation of the primary function of shoe soles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dugumala jalen, fitini dɔ** (Air, moisture): While soles might have some effect on moisture, it's not their main purpose for preventing injuries.
* **B: Golo** (Leather): Leather can be used for soles, but it's not what they *absorb* for impact.
* **C: Talɔn dɔ** (Threads): Threads are used to stitch the sole to the shoe, but they don't absorb impact.



"
Jaabi jumɛn de dilen don taamadenw ma Jatigiya falen-falen erezow fɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Cogoya nɔgɔmaniw**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dunanjigina labilalenw ka lisi be d'ima ola walima sɛbɛn cogoyala ani/walima ɛntɛrɛnɛti sanfɛ, waatidɔw la nin kunafoniw ye ani ɲɛfɔli kabɔ woyazikɛra wɛrɛ yɔrɔ."" This translates to: ""In addition, the list includes useful websites and/or online services, as well as phones and social media accounts of indigenous communities.""

This clearly indicates that the websites and online services are provided **by indigenous communities (cogoya nɔgɔmaniw)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Siyɔrɔw ani jatigiw (Leaders and elders):** While leaders and elders might be involved, the text doesn't explicitly state they *provide* the websites and services.
* **C: Lajɛliw tukukuɲɔkɔn na min bɛ kɛ bila sirabagaw fɛ (People who have been affected by disaster):** The text mentions people affected by disaster in the context of the initial program, but it doesn't say they *provide* the ongoing websites and services.
* **D: Gɛrɛɲɔgɔnnaw ni taamaden wɛrɛw ye ka taa yɔrɔ kelen lajɛ (Government and development agencies that are involved in development):** The text focuses on indigenous communities providing the resources, not government or development agencies.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, ninnu laseliw jumɛn kelen minw bɛ jatigiya falen falen erezo kan ni ciyɛn tɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Dunanjigina labilalenw ka lisi bɛ di taamadenw ma u taa yɔrɔ la.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dunanjigilaw ka lisi be d'ima ola walima sɛbɛn cogoyala ani/walima ɛntɛrɛnɛti sanfɛ, waatidɔw la nin kunafoniw ye ani ɲɛfɔli kabɔ woyazikɛra wɛrɛ yɔrɔ.""

This translates to: ""The digital landscape includes both online business and/or online internet services, as well as phones and social media platforms for communication of youth and youth culture.""

This directly answers the question of *what* the digital landscape is made up of.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunanjigilaw ka kunafoniw bɛ di taamadenw ma tuma bɛ** (Digital networks are being developed and are growing): While true, it doesn't describe the *composition* of the digital landscape.
*   **B: Erezo dɔw bɛ taamadenw sɛgɛsɛgɛli wɛrɛ laɲinin** (These things are being developed in a creative way): This focuses on *how* things are being developed, not *what* they are.
*   **D: Dunanjigilaw ka ɲɛfɔli labɛn ne do waatidɔw taamadenw ye** (Digital networks include communication and social media platforms):  While a *part* of the answer, it doesn't capture the full scope of what the digital landscape encompasses.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dunan sugu jumɛn teli man di kosɛbɛ dunanjigiso den tila len dɔ kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **D: Dunan dɔ min bɛ san bisaba cɛmancɛ yɔrɔ la**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where a river (Dunajiginyɔrɔ) is overflowing and causing damage to nearby villages.** The damage is so severe that it's affecting the livelihoods of the people.
* **The question asks about the reason for the river's overflowing.**  It's looking for the cause.
* **Option D states: ""The river is overflowing because of the excessive rain in the highlands.""**  This directly addresses the likely cause of a river overflowing – heavy rainfall upstream.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dunan minnu bɛ san mugan daminɛ la (The river is overflowing because the dam is broken).** While a broken dam could cause flooding, the passage doesn't mention a dam.
* **B: Dunan dɔ min kelen bɛ taama sira la (The river is overflowing because the channels are blocked).**  Blocked channels might contribute to flooding, but it's less likely to cause such widespread and severe overflowing as described.
* **C: Dunan dɔ min bɛ taama la ni denmisɛn fitiniw ye (The river is overflowing because the people are committing evil deeds).** This is a superstitious and illogical explanation. The passage is about a natural phenomenon.



Therefore, **D** is the most plausible and logical explanation based on the given passage.



"

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks about the number of years it took for the Danube to reach the Black Sea.
* **The text (P)** states that the Danube used to be a large river, but its water level has decreased significantly over time, leading to the formation of many oxbow lakes. It also mentions that the current situation is affecting the lives of people who depend on the river.
* **Option C** states that it took approximately 70 years for the Danube to reach the Black Sea. This aligns with the context of the text describing a change in the river's course and a significant decrease in water levels over time. The other options don't provide a plausible timeframe for such a significant change.

Therefore, option C is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ni laseli ninnu jumɛn kelen bɛ boomerang filili bugunnatigɛ tigitigi?","The correct answer is **A: A bɛ segin kana i tikɛ kɔnɔ tuma bɛ n'a fila kaɲɛ** (It flies back to the thrower if thrown correctly).

Here's why:

* **The passage explains the core function of a boomerang.** It states that if thrown correctly, it returns to the thrower.
* **Option A directly reflects this core function.**  It says the boomerang ""flies back to the thrower if thrown correctly.""
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** While Boomerangs are popular with tourists, the passage doesn't focus on tourism.
    * **C:**  This is true, but not the central point of *how* a boomerang works.
    * **D:** This is a detail about the material, but not the key principle of its flight.



"
Ninnu fɛn jumɛnw de bɛ kɛ Javakaw ka dumuni la?,"The correct answer is **C: Kalo sukaro** (Javanese sugar).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Java dumunitobicogo be dumuni nafɛn manw nɔgɔmani suguya camaw jira, kasajalan fɔlɔ Jaŋa mɔgɔw bɛɛ min fɛ ye kako ye, forɔnto bileman, **sukaro (kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala Java kako sukaro)** ani nafɛn farima cama wɛrɛw.""

This translates to: ""...Java's specialties include various foods made from rice, vegetables, fried foods, **sugar (Javanese palm sugar and regular sugar)** and other delicacies.""

Therefore, ""Kalo sukaro"" (Javanese palm sugar) is explicitly mentioned as a specialty of Java.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, bana mɔgɔ minɛta bɛ cari cogodi?","The correct answer is **C: Banakisɛ fitiniw**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bana mɔgɔ minɛta ye bana ye min be yɛlɛma nɔgɔyala gɛrɛlila banabatɔ dɔ gɛrɛfɛ. **Banakisɛw fitiniw** walima banakisɛ tɔw.""

This translates to: ""The children of the community are those who are able to work hard and earn a living. **The children who are mischievous** and the children who are rebellious.""

Therefore, the text explicitly mentions ""banakisɛ fitiniw"" (mischievous children) as one of the groups of children the community members are concerned about.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn bɛ wele ko bana mɔgɔ minɛtaw?","The correct answer is **A: Bolociliw (Tumors)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nin mɔgɔ minunw deli dɔkɔtɔrɔw ka kumakanw kan, daɲɛw yɛlɛmali ani minɛli tɛ kɔrɔ kelenw ye. Bana yɛlɛmata ye bana ye min nati banakisɛ dɔ fɛ, inafɔ wirisuw, banakisɛ fitiniw, gololabanakisɛw walima banakisɛ tɔw.""

This translates to: ""People go to doctors for various diseases, including cancer, tumors, infections, inflammations, and wounds. Children have diseases such as fever, infections, inflammations, or wounds.""

The question asks what ""bolociliw"" (tumors) is related to in the context of diseases affecting children.  The text directly links tumors to the diseases affecting children. The other options (infections, inflammations, wounds) are also mentioned, but tumors are specifically listed as a type of disease.

Ninnu sinariyo jumɛn na ɛntɛrɛnɛti tamasiyɛn jateden taali katɛmɛ Kelen VPN di baga kan o bɛ baara kɛla ka baara ɲɛnabɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: A baara kɛla bɛfɛ ka ɛntɛrinɛti siraw bɛɛ falen** (It protects the privacy of internet traffic).

Here's why:

* **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** works by creating an encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic. This means that your online activity is hidden from prying eyes, including your internet service provider (ISP) and potential hackers.  The key function of a VPN is to mask your IP address and encrypt your data, making it appear as though you are browsing from a different location.
* Options B, C, and D describe features of the internet in general or related to specific websites/services (like HTTPS) but *not* the core function of a VPN, which is privacy and security of traffic.



Therefore, option A accurately describes the primary purpose of using a VPN."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu laseli jumɛnw VPNs ani ɛntɛrɛnɛti tamasiyɛn jatedenw kan min tɛ ciyɛn ye?","The correct answer is **A: VPNs yɛrɛ bɛ kunnafoni caman di ka tɛmɛ ɛntɛrɛnɛti tamasiyɛn jatedenw kan**.

Here's why:

The question asks what VPNs are used for in the context of accessing the internet. The passage states that people use VPNs to access restricted websites and online services. Option A directly reflects this by saying VPNs are used to access websites that are blocked.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ɛntɛrɛnɛti tamasiyɛn jatedenw tɛ se ka kunnafoni tɛmɛ siraw bɛɛ yɛlɛma** (Internet services are sometimes blocked) - While true, this doesn't explain *how* VPNs are used in relation to these restrictions.
* **C: Ɛntɛrɛnɛti tamasiyɛn jatedenw sɛriwisi ɲumanka dɔgɔ ni y'a ta ka suma ni VPNs ye** (The most popular internet service providers often offer VPNs) - This talks about ISPs offering VPNs, not the *function* of VPNs.
* **D: VPNs bɛ se ka http siraw dɔrɔn de yɛlɛma** (VPNs are used to block HTTP websites) - This is incorrect. VPNs don't *block* HTTP websites; they allow you to access them securely, often bypassing restrictions. They can be used to encrypt HTTP traffic, but the primary function isn't blocking.

Here's why:

The passage describes how internet allows people to make calls. It mentions ""internet telephony"" as a way to make calls over the internet and points out that this is a new method that can replace traditional phone calls (PSTN).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Telefɔni nɛgɛjuruw minnu bɛ se ka diɲɛ fan bɛɛ la sɔrɔ (Internet telephony which is based on the same principle):** This is too general. While internet telephony *uses* the principle of the internet, the question asks *what* enables the use of internet telephony.
*   **C: Sateliti (Satellite):** Satellites are used for internet connections, but not the core technology that *enables* internet telephony itself.
*   **D: PSTN telefɔniw (PSTN telephones):** PSTN telephones are the traditional phone system. The passage mentions they can be replaced by internet telephony, but it doesn't describe internet telephony as being *based on* PSTN technology.

Therefore, **Internet telephony** is the most accurate and complete answer.
"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Waatidɔwla, i kan ka nɛgɛjuru san a dana min be weleli kɛ diɲɛ fan bɛɛ fɛ, min ba to PSTN telefɔniw be sek'i wele."" This translates to: ""Furthermore, internet services that are used for the most common purpose, which is to replace PSTN telephones, are being developed.""

Therefore, the question asks what kind of internet services are being developed to replace PSTN telephones, and the passage directly answers that it's the **internet services that are used for the most common purpose**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka baarakɛ ni nɛgɛjuru baarakɛyɔrɔ min b'i ka yɔrɔ la** (The services of internet providers that allow you to access it): While internet providers exist, the passage is focusing on the *type* of service being developed, not the providers themselves.
*   **C: Ka nɛgɛjuru dɔ sɔrɔ i ka sigida la min b'i ka yɔrɔ la** (The internet that is based on the technology that allows you to access it): The passage isn't detailing the underlying technology.
*   **D: Ka PSTN telefɔni dɔ san** (PSTN telephones themselves): This is incorrect because the passage is talking about *replacing* PSTN telephones with internet services.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sigidi yɛrɛ yɛrɛ ka jateminɛ ye c ani g ye, bari u kalanli be yɛlɛma ko sababu kɛ dafalen nata ye."" This translates to: ""The weather is very hot and the humidity is high, but it is said that it is because of the heat and the humidity.""
* **The question asks:** ""Why do Italians often get sunburned?""
* **Option D directly addresses the cause of sunburn:** ""Italians often get sunburned because of the high heat and humidity.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This talks about the type of skin that is prone to sunburn, not the reason *why* Italians get sunburned.
* **B:** This talks about the type of lotion Italians use, not the cause of sunburn.
* **C:** This talks about how Italians try to avoid sunburn, not the reason *why* they get it.



"

The text states: ""Sirafilancɛɛ belebelebaw, sojan ɲɛfɛra fitiri manw ani feere kɛ butiki kuraw dilane nin ladala sosanfɛla bilemanw ye..."" which translates to ""The Greek population was flourishing, and soldiers were stationed, as well as shops and businesses dealing with various goods...""

Therefore, the flourishing Greek population is the most accurate answer to the question of what was prominent in Izmir at that time.
"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen tɛ Izmir tamasiɲɛn tigitigi?,"The correct answer is **D: A jida ye Turquie jida belebele ba filanan ye** (It is one of Turkey's most important cities).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Izmir de ye Turquie duguba saban ye nin mɔgɔ miliyɔn 3,7 ɲɔgɔna ye, pɔri ba filana Istanbul kɔfɛ, ani tiransipɔri cogoya ɲuman baw."" This translates to ""Izmir is one of Turkey's most important cities, after Istanbul, and a major hub for cargo transportation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dugu in bɛ jida belebele ba dɔ munumunu** (It is a very old and important city): While Izmir *is* old, the passage emphasizes its *current* importance as a trade and transportation hub, not solely its age.
* **B: Dugu cogoya bɛ Turquie kɔrɔlenma de yira** (It is a major port in Turkey): While Izmir *is* a major port, the passage emphasizes its role in *overall* importance as a city and transportation hub, not just its port status.
* **C: I bɛ se ka butiki kuraw ani egilizi kɔrɔw sɔrɔ yen** (It is known for its shops and English cuisine): The passage mentions shops and English cuisine as *part* of its appeal, but it's not the defining characteristic of its importance.



"
Hanami daɲɛ bɛ mun filɛli kofɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kodofin fɔlɔw**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Zapon kɔnɔ, kodofin fɔlɔw falenfanw kun bilɛ masakɛ fɛ a yɛrɛ dɔrɔn ye ani dugutigilakaw minunw be masakɛ so gɛrɛfɛ."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the tradition of *kodofin fɔlɔw* is the reason for the cherry blossom viewing, and the people have been enjoying picnics and gatherings.""

Therefore, the reason for *hanami* (cherry blossom viewing) is the tradition of *kodofin fɔlɔw*.
"
Jɔnni ye kodoninfin faleni lajɛliw labɛnw daminɛ fɔlɔ fɔlɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: Zapɔn masakɛ** (Japan cooks).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Zapon kɔnɔ, kodofin fɔlɔw falenfanw kun bilɛ masakɛ fɛ a yɛrɛ dɔrɔn ye..."" which translates to ""Japan, the code follows the traditions of cooking food that is delicious...""

* **The question asks:** ""Jɔnni ye kodoninfin faleni lajɛliw labɛnw daminɛ fɔlɔ fɔlɔ?"" which translates to ""What does Jɔnni's code follow?"".

Therefore, Jɔnni's code (referring to Japan's code/traditions) follows cooking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Siniwaw ka masakɛ** (Chinese cooks): The text focuses on Japan, not China.
* **B: Zapɔn ka hɔrɔnw** (Japan has rice): While true, it doesn't directly answer what Japan's code *follows*.
* **D: Siniwa dugutigilakaw** (Chinese traditional medicine): This is irrelevant to the text.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Jerusalem ye Israel lajɛli kɛ yɔrɔ baw dɔla kelen ye. Tariku, fuyeli ani seko ni dɔnko yɔrɔ camaw be Jerusalem, nin a sani kɛ yɔrɔw falen ba ani makananw, kafeminw yɔrɔw ani dumunikɛyɔrɔw ye.""

Translation: ""Jerusalem is the holy city for the Jews. History, faith and religious sites are in Jerusalem, which is visited by pilgrims, tourists, and people of all faiths.""

This clearly indicates that Jerusalem's tourism is driven by its religious and historical significance. The other options are less accurate based on the provided text.



"
Nin jumɛn de ma fɔ tɛmɛsiran in kɔnɔ ka kɛ fɛn ye Jerusalem dɔnnen bɛ min ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Dinɛ nafa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dugu in dinɛ nafan ye ani kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala Dugu Kɔrɔ mara yɔrɔ camaw..."" which translates to ""The land itself is a source of conflict and a focal point of the conflict of the Great Power...""  ""Dinɛ nafan"" means ""the land itself"" or ""the territory"". The passage emphasizes that the land itself is the root cause of the conflict in Jerusalem.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Tariku kabakoma** (Ancient History): While history is relevant, the text directly points to the land as the core issue.
*   **B: Politiki hawujali** (Political Rivalry): Political rivalry is *a* factor, but the text stresses the land's inherent nature as a source of conflict.
*   **D: Seko ni donko yɔrɔw** (Religious beliefs): Religious beliefs are a factor, but the text emphasizes the land itself as the fundamental source of the conflict.

Therefore, ""Dinɛ nafa"" (the land itself) best reflects the text's primary point.
"
"Ka Kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dugutagala sugu jɔn tɛna sani sɔrɔ ni Wild Card ye?","The correct answer is **D: Woyasikɛla min b'a boloda ka Kruger Park National lajɛ ani pariki kelen wɛrɛ a dɔgɔyalen ba.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Inafɔ Sud-Afiriki Dugu Parikiw bɛɛ, dɔngodɔn marali ani paraki dɔn li waariw beyi.""  (It forms the South African Large Parks, with a variety of large and small parks.)
* **It also states:** ""a be jateminɛ inafɔ South African National Parks dirapo (SANParks) ye."" (it is managed by the South African National Parks organization (SANParks).)
* **The question asks:** ""Ka Kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dugutagala sugu jɔn tɛna sani sɔrɔ ni Wild Card ye?"" (If you want to visit, what is the best option for a Wild Card?)
* **Therefore, the best answer is that a Wild Card is for visiting Kruger National Park and other parks managed by SANParks.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Woyasikɛla min b'a boloda ka SANParks caman lajɛ i ko a bɛ se cogo min** (It is an option that SANParks offers as a good one) - While true, it doesn't specifically mention Kruger National Park.
* **B: Woyasikɛla min bɛ Kruger National Park dɔrɔn lajɛ** (It is an option that is a Kruger National Park option) -  It doesn't convey that it's *the best* option or that it covers *other* parks.
* **C: Woyasikɛ tikɛmagɛlɛn min jɔrɔlen bɛ pariki musaka kow la** (It is a ticket that you can buy to enter the park) - While you *can* buy a ticket, the question is about a ""Wild Card"" which is a broader pass, not just a ticket.

Therefore, **D** is the most comprehensive and accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Nin kumasen jumɛn nin tɛ Kruger Park National ɲɛfɔ ka ɲa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ale de ye Sudafiriki Parks National bɛɛ la dɔgɔmani ye**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""O ye Sud-Afiriki samalikɛyɔrɔw baw kelen dɔ ye ani a be jateminɛ inafɔ South African National Parks dirapo (SANParks) ye.""  This translates to: ""It is one of South Africa's most famous national parks and is managed by the South African National Parks authority (SANParks).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A jatelen bɛ nafɔ Sudafiriku samalikɛyɔrɔba dɔ:** While the park is in South Africa, this doesn't describe *what* the park is.
* **B: Kunko ani kunkosogow bɛ falen falen pariki yɔrɔmaraw ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ:** This describes the landscape of the park, not its management or status.
* **D: Lajɛlikɛlaw bɛ yamaruya ka don a kɔnɔ Wild card sanni sira fɛ:**  This refers to a type of permit for visiting national parks and is not the fundamental description of what Kruger National Park *is*.

Here's why:

The text describes how the massive stone blocks of Machu Picchu are fitted together so precisely that no mortar is needed. It specifically mentions the ""kulu donda fitiniw dɔ be kulu sanfɛlara min tɛmɛ kan ka kɛ min fɛ"" which translates to ""The large stone blocks that are fitted together so perfectly are very impressive.""  The text highlights the remarkable feat of engineering and precision involved in assembling these blocks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ɲigini (The mountain)**: While Machu Picchu is located on a mountain, the text doesn't focus on the mountain itself as the reason for its impressive construction.
* **B: Senbila kabakurun (The stonemasons)**: The stonemasons were undoubtedly skilled, but the text emphasizes the *result* of their skill – the precise fitting of the stones – rather than the stonemasons themselves.
* **D: Juru nɛgɛlamaw (The Inca rulers)**: The Inca rulers commissioned Machu Picchu, but the text doesn't attribute the impressive construction directly to the rulers. It focuses on the technical aspect.

Nin kuma jumɛn tɛ kɛɲɛni Machu Picchu kulu yɛlɛnda ɲɛfɔlen ye nin tɛmɛsiran in kɔnɔ kaɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: I ka kɛn ka tɛmɛn kulu donda fitini dɔ fɛ sanfɛlala**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kulu dɔnda fitinini dɔ be kulu sanfɛlara min tɛmɛ kan ka kɛ min fɛ, a ka surun kosɛbɛ ani a ka dɔkɔ.""  This translates to: ""The large stone blocks that make up the large terraces are very large, and they are fitted together and locked.""

Option C accurately reflects this information: ""I ka kɛn ka tɛmɛn kulu donda fitini dɔ fɛ sanfɛlala"" translates to ""It is that the large stones that make up the large terraces are very large.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hali kuluyɛlɛna kɛnɛmanw ninakili bɛna se ka durun** (The large stones that make up the terraces are very heavy) - While the stones are likely heavy, the text emphasizes their size and how they are fitted together, not just their weight.
* **B: Juru min bɛ minɛ tikɛ la o fosi tɛ dingɛmayɔrɔw la** (The people who built it had to move the stones) - The text doesn't mention the effort required to move the stones, but rather how they are fitted together.
* **D: dingɛmayɔrɔw bɛ kɛ farati waati min n'u ɲiginnen don** (The builders were very skilled) - While the builders were undoubtedly skilled, the text focuses on the physical characteristics of the stones and their arrangement.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsiran in ye, ninnu jumɛn de tɛ Majorikaw ka duminitɔbita fanba dɔ ye?","The correct answer is **A: Sogo**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""Mayorque toboli inafɔ Mediterane yɔrɔ tɔw ta sinsinleno burukuna, nankɔkɔnɔ fenw ani sogo (kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala lɛ), ani be olive tulu itilize a bɛɛla."" 

This translates to: ""Majorca is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, and its land is arid (desert-like), and it is known for olive trees.""

The question asks what the land of Majorca is made of. The text explicitly states that the land is **sogo** (arid/desert-like).

Therefore, the answer is **Sogo**."
"Ka da kunafoniw kan minnu bɛ tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, kuma jumɛn fɔlen bɛ hangi meal kun kan n’o tɛ tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **A: Dingɛ kalaman funteni bɛ tasuma ka fara kalayalenw itilize walasa ka dingɛ dun kalaya**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What kind of meal do they have that is popular in Rotorua, and what ingredients are used to prepare it?""
* **The answer A states:** ""The meal is a pie that uses the same ingredients as a delicious pie."" This directly addresses both parts of the question: identifies the popular meal (pie) in Rotorua and hints at the use of familiar, good-quality ingredients.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** Mentions Wellington, which isn't relevant to Rotorua or the ingredients.
    * **C:** Simply repeats information about the ingredients without specifying what the meal is.
    * **D:** Mentions Rotorua but doesn't describe the meal or its ingredients.



"
Nin jumɛn de ma fɔ nafɔ hangi dingɛ kalayaya cogoya yɛrɛyɛrɛ dɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: Dugukolo funteni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yɔrɔ camaw Rotorua kɔnɔ be digɛn kalama nin dugufutɛnti ye di tumamina nin digɛn kalama dɔw be seka sɔrɔ Christchurch, Wellington kɔnɔ ani yɔrɔ wɛrɛw.""
* **Translation:** ""The Maori people of Rotorua and the accommodation facilities are well-known for their traditional hangi and other cultural performances, which are also popular in Christchurch, Wellington and other regions.""
* **The question asks:** ""What is the main component of the hangi?""
* **Therefore, the answer is ""Dugukolo funteni"" (Hangi food/cooked food).**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gasi (Gas):** Hangi is cooked underground using hot stones, not gas.
* **B: Farakalamaw (Saltwater):** Hangi involves cooking food underground, not with saltwater.
* **D: Farakalamaw (Saltwater):** Same as above, incorrect.

Therefore, the only option that accurately describes the main component of a hangi, according to the passage, is ""Dugukolo funteni."""
Mun de bɛ seka kɛ Mɔwani walima masɛri ka lakodonni kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen jaabi ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka dantugulan dɔ sigan monasitɛri la**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes how the monks wear simple clothes (kinkiriw datugu - simple cloth). 
* It also mentions they wear a sign (sign kabɔ maara) that indicates they are avoiding worldly pleasures.
* The question asks what the monks wear to show their commitment to avoiding worldly desires. 
* Therefore, the sign they wear that identifies them as monks and signifies their dedication to avoiding worldly pleasures is the answer.  This is directly linked to their life in the monastery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka datugulan ɲuman dɔ don (Simple cloth):** While monks wear simple cloth, it's not the *sign* they wear to show their commitment.
* **B: Ka kamakunw datugu (Simple clothing):** Similar to A, simple clothing is part of their life, but not the specific *sign* mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Ka zupu dɔ don min bɛ kinkiriw sanfɛ (Avoidance of worldly pleasures):** This describes the *goal* of their clothing, but not the *object* they wear to show it.



"
Nin finidonta jumɛn sinka ta man telin ka sɔrɔ ka monasitɛri la? ,"The correct answer is **C: Pantalɔnw**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""O sira kelen fɛ, a ɲinineno cɛw fɛ ka **pantalɔn** do minunw b'u kinkiri kunw datugu.""  This translates to: ""He (the monk) wears a robe, and his brethren wear trousers made of dark cloth.""  Therefore, the answer is ""pantalɔn"" (trousers).
"
Waati jumɛn lajɛlikɛla bɛna okaziyɔn ba sɔrɔ ka lolow ye tuma min na a bɛ ka Antarctic fanw lajɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Tilemafɛ kalow waatila** (Ice formations).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Komi mɔgɔ caman tɛ a yɔrɔw la, ani polisiyɔn fitini dɔrɔn ne be yen ola ote problemoun ye tuma dɔw la, i be sekana nisondiya nin lolow ye."" This translates to: ""People are wondering about the reason for the large amount of snow, and the police are investigating the cause of the problem, suspecting ice formations.""

Therefore, the passage directly suggests that the ""lolow ye"" (problem) is related to ""tilemafɛ kalow waatila"" (ice formations). The other options are not supported by the text.



"
Waati jumɛn telefɔni satelitima tɛna seka kɛ tɛlɛfɔni pɔritabulu nɔnabila ɲuman ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Ni a bɛna seka baara kɛnɛma**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Telefoni satelitiman be seka latigɛ kelen dɔrɔn ye. Telefoni satelitiman tɛ waatcamana tɛlɛfɔni pɔritabulu nɔnabila ye..."" which translates to ""Satellite phones are like mobile phones..."".  This indicates that satellite phones **can do the same things** as mobile phones.  Option C, ""Ni a bɛna seka baara kɛnɛma"" (They can make calls), accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ni bɛ sɔn ka kɛ** (They are similar): While true, this is too general. The question asks *how* they are similar.
*   **B: Ni yɔrɔ ka jan kojugun** (People can use them): This is also true but doesn't answer *what* the similarity is.
*   **D: Ni taa min bɛ sɔrɔ hakɛya dɔw ɲinni** (They have the same price): The passage doesn't mention price.



"
Waati jumɛn telefɔni satelitima bɛ se ka kanu ni pɔritabulu ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Waati min mago bɛ kunafoni jan na**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Telefɔni satelitiman tɛ waatcamana tɛlɛfɔni pɔritabulu nɔnabila ye..."" This translates to ""Satellite phones are like portable telephones..."" Therefore, the key similarity between satellite phones and portable phones is their ability to make calls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sɛgɛnɔbɔ waati duguba kɔnɔ** (Waterproof water) - The text doesn't mention anything about waterproof capabilities.
*   **B: Batɔnkɔnɔ-sɛgɛnafiyɛnbɔ waati** (Battery-saving water) - The text doesn't mention anything about battery saving.
*   **D: Waati min i ka telin ka erezo ma yɔrɔ sɔrɔ** (Water that can be used for communication in remote areas) - While satellite phones *can* be used in remote areas, the text's main point of comparison is their function as phones.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Nin jumɛn nɔfɛ mankan kɛra sababu ye ka Transnitria Jamana sigi sen kan?,"The correct answer is **B: Siyako**.

The text states: ""San 1994, nin kɛlɛ in kɛra sababu ye ka Transnistria jamana sigisenkan Maldive kɔrɔnyanfan fɛ, min ka gɔfɛrɛneman b'a bolo ani waari nka a ma kodɔn Diɲɛforobatɔnba jamana sifɛ."" This translates to: ""In 1994, the reason for the Transnistria conflict was because the government failed to resolve the conflict peacefully."" The text explicitly mentions ""siyako"" (conflict) as the reason.
"
Nin fɛn jumɛn kelen bɛ Transnistria Jamana bolo n’o ni Moldavvie fan tɔ tɛ kelen ye?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Waari**.

The text states: ""San 1994, nin kɛlɛ in kɛra sababu ye ka Transnistria jamana sigisenkan Maldive kɔrɔnyanfan fɛ, min ka gɔfɛrɛneman b'a bolo ani waari nka a ma kodɔn Diɲɛforobatɔnba jamana sifɛ.""

This translates to: ""In 1994, this became a reason for Transnistria separatists to fight for independence, which led to a government that became a non-participant in the international arena.""

Therefore, the reason for the conflict was a **war**.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jumɛ dugutaala ka kan Montevideo lajɛ ni u jigi bɛ a kan ka fuɲɔ fɛkɛn?","The correct answer is **C: Bafɛla fɛ tilemadaminɛ kalow waati**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Montevideo be turopiki dugumataw kɔnɔ; tilemaw fɛ, goniyahakɛ yɛlɛli ka tɛmɛ degire 30 kan ka ca. Nɛnɛ damatɛmɛlen be seka kɛ nisongoyala: goniyajakɛ be jigin cogogɛlɛ jali duguma, nka fiyɛn ani sumaya be faara ɲɔgɔnkan ka nɛnɛ tɔ juguya ka tɛmɛ goniyahakɛ sumana be min fɔ kan.""

This translates to: ""Montevideo is a port city; its area is about 30 square kilometers. The population is made up of immigrants: immigrants are a large group, and the elderly and children are also immigrants who came to live in Montevideo.""

The question asks: ""What is the population of Montevideo, and how many immigrants are there?""

The passage explicitly says the population is made up of immigrants, and describes immigrants as a large group.  It further explains that the elderly and children are also immigrants who came to live there. This indicates the population is composed *of* immigrants. Therefore, the population *is* the immigrant population.  Option C, ""Bafɛla fɛ tilemadaminɛ kalow waati"" (Immigrant population of Montevideo), best reflects this meaning.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jɔn dugutaala ka kan ka Montevideo lajɛ ni nɛnɛ waati dɔni be?","The correct answer is **A: Waati min tilema bɛ Montevideo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Monteŋideo be turopiki dugumataw kɔnɔ; tilemaw fɛ, goniyahakɛ yɛlɛli ka tɛmɛ degire 30 kan ka ca.""  This translates to: ""Montevideo is a city of many streets; the weather is hot, and the temperature reaches 30 degrees Celsius.""

The question asks what kind of weather is in Montevideo. The text directly answers this by saying the weather in Montevideo is ""tilema"" (hot).  Therefore, option A, ""Waati min tilema bɛ Montevideo"" (The weather in Montevideo is hot), is the correct answer.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin jumɛ de bɛ seka fara ɲɔgɔn kan ni garafiti aritisi sigilen ye, ni a vandalisimu bɛli?","The correct answer is **A: Ko Graffiti**.

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where people are painting graffiti on walls, and it mentions the negative impact (""vandalisimu"" - vandalism). The question asks what the situation is about, specifically whether it's about graffiti or vandalism.

* **Ko Graffiti** directly refers to the act of painting graffiti.
* The other options are not as precise:
    * **Sɛnni jɛgɛnnen** (Something related to the sky) is irrelevant.
    * **Sɛbɛnninakoko min ma kanu foroba ta la** (Something that goes up and down) is also irrelevant.
    * **Sɛbɛnni minnu tɛ seka kalan** (Something that moves and makes color) is too general and doesn't specifically address the context of wall painting.

Therefore, ""Ko Graffiti"" is the most accurate and direct answer.
"
Fɔli ɲanɛjɛ fɛn jumɛn ni laminɛnikɛlaw bɛ a jaate koyelen kɔrɔ nafama fɛn dɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka na ni denmisɛnni fitiniw ye**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the fetish priest's power comes from their connection to the spirits (dɔngili). The passage states that the priest performs rituals to communicate with these spirits and that the spirits guide their actions.  The question asks what the priest uses to communicate with these spirits.  The passage explicitly says the priest uses **denmisɛnni fitiniw** (spiritual/ritualistic practices).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka sigi yɔrɔ dɔ la (Using words):** While communication might involve words, the passage emphasizes the spiritual practices and rituals as the primary means.
*   **C: Ka Fɔli kɛ a la dugufilama (Using the sacred object):**  The passage mentions the priest uses a gɛrɛfɛ (sacred object), but it's the rituals performed *with* the object, not the object itself, that are key.
*   **D: Kana jɔna (Praying):**  While praying might be a component, the passage highlights more comprehensive ritualistic actions.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛti lajɛla ka kan ka mun de kɛ baara bɛɛ la nafa ma ye n’u bɛ fɛ ka kɛ dɔngili kɛrɛfɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Ka to sigiyɔrɔ dɔ la denbayaw kama**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the functions of the Feti (spirit/deity).** It states that the Feti can heal illnesses, provide guidance, and protect people.
* **The question asks about the reason why the Feti is sought after.** The passage implies that people seek out the Feti for assistance in difficult situations, specifically mentioning healing and guidance (""ka sigi o yɔrɔla"" - to seek direction/advice, and ""ani lajɛlikɛlaw camaw b'o jateminɛ kakɛ ɲɛnɛbaara nafan ma ye"" - and when a person is facing problems that cannot be solved by normal means).
* **Option B (""Ka to sigiyɔrɔ dɔ la denbayaw kama"" - To seek the help of the spiritual power) directly addresses this need.** It explains *why* people seek the Feti – for its ability to provide help and solve problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka taa sufɛlala (""To offer sacrifices"")** While sacrifices might be part of Feti worship, the passage doesn't explicitly state that sacrifices are the primary reason for seeking the Feti.
* **C: Ka sigi yɔrɔ in kɔfɛ (""To seek direction in the future"")** While guidance is a function of the Feti, the passage focuses more on addressing current problems and illnesses.
* **D: Kana jɔna (""To pray"")**  The passage doesn't equate seeking the Feti with simply praying. It describes a more active engagement for help and intervention.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided text.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dugu fitiniw bariw yan tɛ waatibɛɛ yɔrɔ ɲumanw ye ka ɲɛsin lajɛlikɛla dunaw ma.""  This translates to ""Many people are coming to the area to find work and live a good life.""
* **The question asks:** ""What is the reason why many people are migrating to New Mexico?""
* **Option B, ""Dugufitiniw bariw"" (Many people), directly reflects the information given in the passage about the migration of people seeking work and a better life.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ŋaɲankɔnɔnanw (The people of the land):** This refers to the indigenous people of the area and isn't the primary reason for the *current* migration described.
* **C: Sugubulonbaw (Mobile phones):**  Mobile phones are mentioned as a tool for communication but not the reason for the migration itself.
* **D: Kazinow (Casinos):** Casinos are mentioned as a specific attraction, but the passage highlights broader economic opportunities, not just casinos.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Kazino minunw bɛɛ tɔgɔfɔla sanfɛ be mininfenw feere..."" (Casinos were established in Santa Fe...)
* **The question asks:** ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, lajelikɛla ka telin ka ɲɛnɛjɛ dɔnnenba sɔrɔ yɔrɔ jumɛn na Nouvelle Mevique kɔkɔdugu ya fan fɛn?"" (What is the reason for the growth of the casino business in New Mexico in recent years?)
* **The text implies the growth is linked to the existing casinos in Santa Fe.** The text mentions the casinos in Albuquerque and Santa Fe and how they contribute to the economy.  Therefore, casinos in Santa Fe are a key factor in the casino business's growth in New Mexico.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kazino dɔ min ni Albuquerque cɛ ye lɛri fila ye (Casinos in Albuquerque are the largest revenue generators):** The text mentions Albuquerque *along with* Santa Fe, but doesn't state Albuquerque is the *largest*.
* **B: Ŋaɲankɔnɔnan jan dɔ la (The people of New Mexico):**  While people of New Mexico are involved, the question specifically asks about the reason for the *growth* of the casino business, not just the existence of the people.
* **D: Dugufitini-bari dɔ la (The population):**  The text mentions population as a contributing factor to the economy, but it doesn't directly link population growth to the casino business's *growth* in recent years. The text focuses more on the established casinos.



"
Wari utilize cogo ɲuman kadi woyasikɛla minnu ye olu bɛ se k’a kanu ka minfɛn suguya juman to?,"The correct answer is **B: Bidɔn kɔnɔ ji**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yɔrɔ orobinɛ ji lakana neno ka min, nka bidɔn kɔnɔ sɔrɔkadi nin i be siran."" This translates to: ""Coffee is a popular drink, and the coffee beans are responsible for its aroma.""

Therefore, the coffee beans (bidɔn kɔnɔ) are central to the aroma/flavor of coffee.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ɔsitarali dɔlɔ (Australian coffee):** While Australians have a coffee culture, the passage doesn't specifically state that Australian coffee beans are the most utilized.
*   **C: Yɔrɔ biyɛri (Coffee plants):**  The passage mentions coffee plants generally but focuses on the *beans* and their aroma.
*   **D: Jiriden nɔnɔ (French coffee):** The passage mentions France's coffee consumption but doesn't highlight the French coffee itself as the most utilized component.



"

The text explicitly states: ""Fiman fitini ye """"espresso"""" ye, cappuccino bena ni kirɛmu ba y'a sanfɛ (musi tɛ), te be di a nɔnɔ tan.""  This translates to ""Coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino made with milk (warm milk), and it is a strong drink.""

Therefore, ""Fiman Fitini"" (Espresso) is the coffee drink mentioned in the text.

"Kulu jumɛn y’e Kolonizasiyɔn daminɛ, min janyara fɔ ka se san kɛmɛsaba ma?","The correct answer is **D: Ɛsipaɲɔliw (Spaniards)**.

Therefore, the Spanish were the primary colonizers.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, cogoya bɛɛ la ɲuman jumɛn ye walasa Pari ka nisɔndiya i kɔrɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Ka tabolo ɲuman kɛ** (It is about a table with a vase).

Here's why:

* The passage describes Ali making a ""table vase"" (mɔgɔ lamɔlen) in Paris. 
* The question asks what the story is about.
* Option C directly reflects the core subject of the passage: a table vase.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka Parika ya tabolo ladede** (It is about a big table in Paris) - While there's a table, the focus isn't on the size of the table in Paris, but rather on the *vase* on the table.
* **B: Ka danyɛrɛla dabila** (It is about a tall person) - The passage doesn't mention anyone's height.
* **D: ka yɛrɛbaya tabolo jira** (It is about a table that exists) -  This is too general.  The story is specifically about a *special* table vase.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin kuma sanga bali jumɛn tɛ jate Pari kaw tabolow fɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Yɛrɛbaya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pari mɔgɔw kodɔnlen nin yɛrɛbaya ye ani kafalenya."" This translates to ""Paris's people are both hardworking and creative.""

The question asks what the people of Paris are described as. The text directly states they are ""yɛrɛbaya"" (hardworking).  While the other options might be related to Paris in a broader sense, the most direct answer to the question about *the people* is hardworking.
"
Kulu fɔlɔ nafa ye mun ye Cape Town MetroRail kan?,"The correct answer is **A: Kɔlɔsiliba bɛ tɛrɛn ɲɛfɛ** (They share trains).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Metropolis ani Metro kɔlɔsilibaw be tirɛn bɛɛ kɔnɔ..."" which translates to ""MetroPlus and Metro share trains...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mɔgɔ man can ten kosɛbɛ** (People can use them) - While true, it's not the *primary* connection between the two. The core connection is the shared trains.
* **C: A da ka nɔkɔn ka tɛmɛ Kulu Sabanan tike kan** (It's a connection to the Metro Sabana ticket) -  This is partially true, but not the main point of the shared trains. The text emphasizes the trains themselves.
* **D: A ni meturo tike sɔnkɔ bɛɛ ye kelen ye** (They have a common ticket system) - While likely a factor, the text focuses on the shared trains as the immediate connection.



Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the text is that the trains are shared."

Here's why:

The text states: ""MetroPlus lafiyakabɔn ani tɛ fa ka damatɛmɛ nka daga gɛlɛn dɔni..."" which translates to ""MetroPlus are comfortable and are used for shorter trips...""  This directly addresses the question of how people travel between train stations in Cape Town.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kulu fila ninnu bɛɛ tike wari ye kelen ye** (Trains are used for shorter trips): While MetroPlus is for shorter trips, the entire statement isn't accurate. Metro is also used for longer trips.
* **C: Kulu saba minnu danfaralen do** (The seven trains run daily): The text doesn't mention the number of trains running daily.
* **D: Kulu fɔlɔ ani kulu filanan kɔlɔsilibaw** (Trains and the combination of trains are interconnected): While trains are interconnected, the text's primary focus in relation to *how* people travel is the comfort and purpose of MetroPlus.

Fɛnɲɛnɛmanin kinikɛla man telin ka nin fɛn juman kelen kɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka bana yɛlɛmataw cari**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bana juguw yɛrɛw, walima bagan faratilenw minunw be seka mɔgɔw bana walima faga nin fagan ye, tɛ jate waaticama inafɔ fɛnɲɛnɛmani mɔgɔtɔrɔlaw."" This translates to: ""Children are often prone to diseases, and the body's weakness makes them susceptible to various ailments, including fever, cough, and colds.""

* **The question asks:** ""What kind of illness is it often accompanied by?"" (Fɛnɲɛnɛmanin kinikɛla man telin ka nin fɛn juman kelen kɛ?)

* **The passage directly links the weakness (""bana juguw yɛrɛw"") to the susceptibility to ""bana yɛlɛmataw cari""** (various ailments, including fever, cough, and colds).  ""Cari"" refers to sickness or illness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka nkɔnɲɛ nati (Cold)** - While a cold is a type of illness, the passage doesn't specifically emphasize cold as the *most* common accompaniment to weakness.
* **B: Ka alɛrzi nati (Allergy)** - Allergies are not directly mentioned in the passage as being commonly associated with weakness.
* **D: Ka banadilidaw nati fan ni fanga la (Other diseases and infections)** - While true, this is too broad. The passage doesn't point to *other* diseases, but rather to the general weakness making someone prone to illnesses. ""Cari"" is a more specific and accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
Telefɔni pisi perepeye bɛ san yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **A: Jamana kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen la** (Specialized technicians).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...dɔw sipesiyalizeleno wele nɔgɔmani dilila piriw la ka jamana kulu kɛrɛnkɛrɛni dɔw la."" This translates to ""...specialized technicians who are very knowledgeable."" 

Therefore, the specialized technicians are the ones who can repair the phones.
"
Keredi minnu bɛ wele nɔgɔman piriw di olu bɛ sirasɔrɔ cogo di?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka telefɔni keredima saralen utilise ani ka musaka wɛrɛ sara.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Keredi minnu bɛ wele nɔgɔman piriw di olu bɛ sirasɔrɔ cogo di?"" which translates to ""What is the main purpose of using a prepaid phone?""
* **The text states:** ""Butuki wɔniw bɛɛ faleno telefɔni pisi pirepeye aranze ɲagamuniw la min be seka itilize telefɔni kirediman saralenw la walima telefɔni gansanw."" This translates to ""Butuki uses prepaid phones to make calls and to use phones without a credit balance."" 
* **The text further explains:** ""...dɔw sipesiyalizeleno wele nɔgɔmani dilila piriw la ka jamana kulu kɛrɛnkɛrɛni dɔw la.

Therefore, the main purpose of using a prepaid phone is to **use phones without a credit balance** and **make calls as much as they want**. Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U bɛ sirasɔrɔ jamana kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen dɔw de la** (""It's about a credit system"") - While the text mentions a credit system, it's not the *main purpose* of *using* a prepaid phone.
* **B: Nɛgɛjuru sira fulama fɛ** (""Credit system"") - Similar to A, this isn't the main purpose of using a prepaid phone.
* **C: Ka telefɔni keredima saralen utilise ani ka musaka wɛrɛ sara.** (""To use a prepaid phone and to make calls as much as one wants"") - While it's not the only purpose, it's not the main purpose of a prepaid phone.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin jiri kelen jumɛn man can Plitvice Lakes dugu pariki kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Sapin**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Plitvice Lakes dugu pariki ye kunko baye, kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala nin hɛtiri ye...""  This translates to ""Plitvice Lakes National Park is big, has many lakes, and is a place of beauty.""

The question asks *what* the lakes are known for.  The passage explicitly states they are known for their **lakes** (hɛtiri).

Therefore, the answer is **Sapin**, which means ""lakes"" in the provided language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hɛtiri** - This means ""beauty"" or ""beautiful"". While the lakes *are* beautiful, the question asks what they *are*.
*   **B: Bunbun** - This means ""small"". The lakes are described as ""big"".
*   **D: Episera** - This means ""episode"" or ""chapter"". This is irrelevant to the description of the lakes.



"
Nin kunko soko sɔrɔbali jumɛn kelen bɛ sɔrɔ Plitvice Lakes dugu pariki kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kunkɔ soko sɔrɔbaliw inafɔ Erɔpu orisi sokolarama, kunkowulu, sɛgɛ, gingin, kunkowulu fitini, **kunkokɔnɔ jakuma ani tetara belebele ba be seka sɔrɔ yen, nin kunkokɔnɔ fɛnw suguya kodɔnlen cama wɛrɛw ye.**""

This translates to: ""The bird species that inhabit the European forests, deer, foxes, lynx, wild boars, wild cats, **capercaillie and various small birds that sing sweetly, and various birds that are colorful and fly in flocks.**""

Therefore, *capercaillie* (kunkokɔnɔ jakuma) is listed as one of the bird species found in Plitvice Lakes National Park."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, maarayɔrɔ kɔdiw b’i dɛmɛ ka mun kɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Ka disiki kopiye**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the Maasai people did to ""prevent"" the kunafoni from being stolen. The text states: ""Tiɲɛla, maarayɔrɔw kɔdiw tɛ kɔlɔlɔ foyi nati kopiyeli kɔnlen la; fitini fitini disiki dɔ kopiyeli be zuye kaɲɛ cogoyala aparɛlanfɛn dɔ la yɔrɔ mina a yɛrɛ yɛrɛ bena zuye."" This translates to: ""However, the Maasai people made a lot of effort and created copies of the kunafoni; in every little thing, they made copies with all kinds of intricate designs and patterns that resembled the kunafoni.""

Therefore, the Maasai people created copies of the kunafoni as a preventative measure against theft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sedili sukuw kuna (New school):** The text doesn't mention building a new school.
* **C: Suɲɛni kunbɛnni (Beautiful pattern):** While the copies had beautiful patterns, the act of creating copies is the preventative measure.
* **D: Kopiyeli kɔnnen (Original copy):** The text explicitly mentions *making* copies, not referring to the original.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛn jumɛn kelen ye nkalon ye kunafonidi baarayɔrɔ bɛ tilen ka min tikɛ maarayɔrɔ kodiw kun kan?","The correct answer is **C: U nafa ka bon tɔnɔ sɔrɔli la**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nin kun ye ka se di baarakɛyɔrɔw ma u ka sukuw kuna; a bɛɛ be tɔnɔ sɔrɔ kuna."" This translates to ""And when they are instructed, the people have to be careful; they say that the honey is a kind of slow-burning fire.""

* **The question asks:** ""What is the reason why the honey is said to be slow-burning?""

* **The passage directly answers:** The honey is said to be slow-burning because it's something people have to be careful with (when instructed), and it's likened to a slow-burning fire (tɔnɔ sɔrɔli la).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U b’a to ni se be di suku kuna (It's just that they are instructed):** While instruction is mentioned, it's not the *reason* for the slow-burning nature.
* **B: U b’an dɛmɛ ka kopiyeli kɔnnen kunbɛn (It's because of the burning of the honey itself):** The passage doesn't explain *how* the honey burns, just that it burns slowly.
* **D: U ka dɔkɔn u ka se ka suɲɛli kunbɛn (It's because they have to be careful with it):**  Carefulness is a consequence of the slow burning, not the reason *why* it's slow burning.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
Lajɛli tɛmɛsiran jumɛn ye tɔgɔ dɔrɔn ye waati min ni bɛ ka se i ka jamana kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: Duwaɲɛw ka lajɛli**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the reason why immigrants come to a country?
* **The text states:** ""Ali na sɔrɔ imigirasiyɔn mɔgɔw ka lajɛliw tɛ yi waaticamana walima ye tɔgɔ dɔrɔn de ye tumamina nin i sera i ka jamanala...""  This translates to: ""Ali is talking about the reasons why immigrants come to a country and the benefits they seek in the country.""  The text continues to explain that they seek better opportunities and a better life.
* **Option D, ""Duwaɲɛw ka lajɛli"" (Reasons for immigration)** directly reflects the core topic and the information provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imigirasiyɔn mɔgɔw ka lajɛliw (Immigrants come to live):** This is a statement of fact, not a *reason* for immigration.
* **B: Fɛnw kofɔli (Foreign currency):** While financial opportunities *can* be a reason, the text emphasizes a broader desire for a *better life*, not just currency.
* **C: Fɛnw dan sariya la (Work and salary):** Similar to B, this is a specific aspect of the overall benefits and not the primary *reason* cited in the text.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer because it encapsulates the main point of the text about why people immigrate."
I ka kan nin fɛn kelen jumɛn dɔn sani i bɛ se i ka jamana kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ni duwaɲɛw ka sɛgɛsɛliyɔrɔ bena kɛ yen**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q):** ""I ka kan nin fɛn kelen jumɛn dɔn sani i bɛ se i ka jamana kɔnɔ?"" translates to ""Why did the immigrants come to this country?"" or ""What was the reason for the immigrants coming to this country?"".

* **The Answer (A):** ""Ni imigirasiyɔn mɔgɔw sɛgɛsɛliyɔrɔ dɔ bɛ na kɛ yen"" translates to ""The immigrants themselves were searching for it."" This doesn't directly answer *why* they came to the country.

* **The Correct Answer (C):** ""Ni duwaɲɛw ka sɛgɛsɛliyɔrɔ bena kɛ yen"" translates to ""The hardships that the immigrants were facing."" This answers the question by implying that the immigrants came *because* of hardship in their home country – a common reason for immigration.

* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:**  Focuses on the immigrants seeking opportunities, but doesn't explain *why* they left their home.
    * **D:** Talks about the immigrants seeking a new life, which is a consequence of coming, but not the reason for coming.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that logically answers the question of why the immigrants came to the country."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn caya b’a to kuluyɛlɛlaw bɛ ka siraw lakodɔn tuma o tuma Cochamo Valley kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **B: Kulusanfɛlaw**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What are the characteristics of the landscapes that are similar to the landscapes of the Cochamo Valley?""
* **The text describes the Cochamo Valley as having:** ""kulusanfɛlaw be kulusanfɛ lajɛli ɲuman baw di kabɔ legelegela."" which translates to ""terraces with many layers of rock that are very high.""
* **Option B, ""Kulusanfɛlaw"" (terraces/layered rock formations), directly reflects this description.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lajɛliw (rocks):** While rocks are present, the question is about the *landscape features*, not just the rocks themselves.
* **C: Legelegew (very high):** This describes *one aspect* of the landscape but doesn't encompass the overall characteristics.
* **D: Kokow (sand):** The text mentions mountains and rocks, not sand dunes.

Therefore, **Kulusanfɛlaw (terraces/layered rock formations)** is the most accurate answer as it directly relates to the key description of the Cochamo Valley's landscape."
"Ka sinsin nin kibaruyadilen ye tɛmɛ sira kɔnɔ, jɔnni bɛ taamaden latɛmɛ caman kɛ worodugu bolo Kan?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

The passage states: ""Star Alliance be ta fan bɛɛ foka ɲinbɔ Pasifiki kɔrɔn an'a worodugu yanfan la kabɔ Santiago de Chilie ka ta Tahiti, min LATAM Oneworld ka wɔli ye."" This translates to ""Star Alliance is the main alliance that operates flights in the South Pacific, going from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, while LATAM Oneworld operates there.""  This directly links Star Alliance to flights in the South Pacific.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **SkyTeam:** The passage mentions SkyTeam as a global alliance, but it doesn't specifically link it to the South Pacific flights mentioned.
*   **South Pacific:** This is a geographical region, not an airline alliance.
*   **LATAM Oneworld:** The passage only mentions LATAM Oneworld operating *some* flights in the South Pacific, but it doesn't say it's the *main* alliance for those flights.



"

The text states: ""Star Alliance be ta fan bɛɛ foka ɲinbɔ Pasifiki kɔrɔn an'a worodugu yanfan la kabɔ Santiago de Chilie ka ta Tahiti, min LATAM Oneworld ka wɔli ye."" This translates to: ""Star Alliance is the one that flies from several South Pacific countries to Santiago de Chile and Tahiti, while LATAM Oneworld flies there.""

Therefore, Star Alliance is the airline alliance mentioned as operating flights in the South Pacific.
"
Taama cakɛda jumɛn tugunna Global Running Tours la?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The text states: ""The Global Running Tours nɔnbila, Go Running Tours be baara kɛ..."" which translates to ""The Global Running Tours name, Go Running Tours is the main one..."". Therefore, Go Running Tours is the main entity being discussed.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Go Running Tours b’a dɛmɛ ka jɛɲɔgɔnya don turisimu cakɛda hakɛ joli nin ɲɔgɔn cɛ?","The answer is **C: Dozens**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""bolikɛ kuluw 200 ɲɔgɔn de beyi"" which translates to ""about 200 people are involved.""
* **The question asks:** ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Go Running Tours b’a dɛmɛ ka jɛɲɔgɔnya don turisimu cakɛda hakɛ joli nin ɲɔgɔn cɛ?"" which translates to ""How many people are there, does Go Running Tours offer tourism and runs?""
* **The passage further states:** ""Nin ju ye Bacelonas Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, Running Tours Prague min sinisinleno Prague ani dɔ wɛrɛw ye sendɔ ala jɔna jɔna."" which translates to ""It is Barcelona Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, Running Tours Prague and other locations in Prague and other places."" This implies more than just 200.  ""Dozens"" is the most appropriate term to describe a number that's more than 200 but not a specific large number.



Therefore, **C: Dozens** is the best fit.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naani** (Yes) - This answers the question, but not *how many* people.
* **B: 200** - The passage says *about* 200, not exactly 200.
* **D: Saba** (Seven) - This is completely irrelevant.

* **The text states:** ""Safari daɲɛ kodɔnlen min be kɛ ye sirakan woyazi ye ka Farafina kunkokɔnɔ ɲuman lajɛ..."" (Safaris are a major attraction for tourists in Farafina...).  The question asks what tourists come to see in Farafina.

* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Ka taa senna yala dɔla kungokɔnɔ** (They come to see the tourist sites of Farafina). While similar, ""kungofilɛ dɔla"" is a more natural and concise way to express ""sights"".
    * **C: Jasaman nunɛti labaara** (A beautiful and ancient village).  The text doesn't mention a specific village as the main attraction.
    * **D: Mɔbili ta ani sariya minɛnw labaara** (Cars and other ancient vehicles).  The text mentions vehicles used for safaris, but not as a primary tourist attraction.



Therefore, option A is the best and most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Ka sinsin nin tɛmɛ sira ye, kungokɔnɔbagan jumɛn nin turisi ka teli ka ɲɔgɔn ye farafinna kungofilɛ senfɛ k’u to bolimafɛn kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Waraninkalanw**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the ""lajɛli"" (tourist safari) as a trip that takes tourists to see the wildlife of Farafina, including animals and plants.  It also mentions that the safari uses vehicles and equipment to facilitate observation.  Finally, it defines ""lajɛli"" as a journey that involves observing animals and plants.

The question asks what the ""lajɛli"" (tourist safari) is *essentially* or *in essence*.  The passage repeatedly emphasizes that it's about observing wildlife. ""Waraninkalanw"" translates to ""observational"" or ""observing."" Therefore, the best answer reflecting the essence of the tourist safari is ""Waraninkalanw.""

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, mun tun bɛ sɛn ka taama musaka lajigin?","The correct answer is **D: Ka mɔgɔ wɔɔrɔ walima caman jɛkulu ɲinin**

Here's why:

* **The Problem (P) describes a situation where people are suffering from a lack of basic necessities (food, water, etc.) and are struggling.** They are using mobile phones to seek help and are desperate for resources.

* **The Question (Q) asks ""What is the reason why people are suffering from hunger?""**  It's directly asking for the cause of the problem described in P.

* **Option D (""Ka mɔgɔ wɔɔrɔ walima caman jɛkulu ɲinin"" - ""Because people are lacking basic necessities"") is the most logical and direct answer.**  The text of P clearly establishes that the problem stems from a lack of food and water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: K’i jɔ ni yɛrɛ ye (""It is the work of the spirits"")** -  This introduces a supernatural explanation, which isn't supported by the text. The problem is presented as a real, societal issue.
* **B: Ka mɔgɔ naani jɛkulu ɲinin (""Because people are strong"")** - This is the opposite of what the text describes. The people are *weakened* by hunger.
* **C: Ka taa nin mɔgɔ wɛrɛ kelen ye (""Because the earth is barren"")** - While the earth *could* be barren, the text doesn't state this. It focuses on the lack of resources available to people.

Here's why:

* **P (Question):**  The question describes a tourist using a mobile phone to take pictures and videos, and that this behavior is causing problems with local people, making them unhappy. 
* **Q (Question):** The question asks what the local people are doing in response to the tourist's behavior.
* **A (Answer):** ""Turisi minnu b’a fɛ ka mɔbili falen falen kɛ"" translates to ""The tourists are taking pictures/videos with their phones a lot.""  This directly reflects the situation described in P and is likely the *reason* for the local people's unhappiness.  It answers the question of what the people are reacting *to*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mɔgɔ saba jɛkulu:**  ""All the people are sleeping.""  This doesn't relate to the tourist behavior or the reaction of the local people.
* **C: Terima fila bɛ ka taama ɲɔgɔn fɛ:** ""They are gathering in the market.""  This doesn't explain the reaction to the tourist's actions.
* **D: Mɔgɔ duuru jɛkulu:** ""The people are walking slowly."" This is not related to the situation.

**Therefore, A is the most logical and accurate answer.**

The text states: ""San Francisco ye turusi infirasirikiti ba camaw dilan nin ɔtɛli camaw ye, dugunikɛyɔrɔw, ani yɔrɔbaw minunw be diɲɛ yɔrɔbaw jɔcogo bato.""

This translates to: ""San Francisco is a tourist infrastructure with hotels, museums, and a large number of people from different cultures.""

Option A, ""Yeli sabatilen sekonindɔnko ani kunnafonidi sira caman na"" translates to ""It has a large number of second-generation and immigrant people."" This aligns perfectly with the text's description of San Francisco having a large population from diverse cultures.

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **B: Jamalajɛrɛsoba sanbalaɲɔnw** - This option is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Sɔrɔkosiratigɛla caya** - This translates to ""Strategic location,"" while San Francisco's location *is* mentioned, the question asks about the *population* in San Francisco.
*   **D: Azikaw ka dumuni ɲɛnajɛ sangatigi nata** - This translates to ""A city with a very high level of internationality,"" while the text mentions international presence, it doesn't explicitly state that it has the *highest* level of internationality.

Here's why:

* **The text describes the process of air travel.** It mentions booking tickets, transportation to the airport, check-in, and security. 
* **The question asks about the time needed to go through security.**
* **Option B (""Taamaden min ka teli ka yɛrɛkunnakow kɛ"" - Time it takes to go through the security lines) directly addresses this.** Security lines are a key part of the airport experience and require time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Taamaden sigasigala (General time)** - Too vague. The question asks about a specific part of the process.
* **C: Taamaden mun m’a ka jamanadonsɛbɛn sɔrɔ (Time to wait for the flight)** - This refers to waiting at the gate, not going through security.
* **D: Taamaden mun b’a kanun donin ci kɛ (Time to fill out the immigration forms)** - While immigration forms are part of international travel, the text doesn't explicitly mention immigration, and the question is about security.

The passage describes the services provided by a travel agency (maralikɛlikabila).  The question asks what kind of service travel agencies offer that helps people get to their destination. Option A, ""Donin ci sɛbɛnw"" (Booking services), directly aligns with the description of travel agencies arranging transportation (flights, transfers) and booking accommodations (hotels).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dunanjiginsow** (Something related to money/finance) - While travel involves money, the core service described isn't simply financial.
*   **C: Donin taata bɛɛ** (Something related to food/meals) - This is completely unrelated to the services described in the passage.
*   **D: Sigiyɔrɔ minɛlen tali** (Something related to planning/scheduling) - While planning is involved, the primary service isn't just planning; it's *executing* the plan by booking services.

Here's why:

* **The text describes common issues with applications:**  It mentions crashes, freezing, slow performance, and problems with notifications.
* **The question asks what to do when an application has problems:**  The text implies that a problem *could* be with the smartphone itself.
* **Option C directly addresses this potential cause:** It states that issues could stem from the application and the smartphone working together.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Taamasyɛnw kɔrɔ fɔli kan wɛrɛw la** (The user has to restart the application): While restarting *can* sometimes fix problems, it's not the *only* or even the *best* solution, and the text doesn't explicitly state it's the first step.
* **B: Masalabolo fanw kulubɛlajɛlen bayɛlɛmali** (The problem is with the application itself):  While the problem *could* be with the app, the text doesn't definitively say that's always the case. It allows for the possibility of a smartphone-related issue.
* **D: Ka kanbayɛlɛmali ka ɲɛ 100% waati bɛɛ la** (The application is 100% updated):  Being updated doesn't guarantee an application will be problem-free.  Updates can sometimes introduce new issues.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical and comprehensive answer based on the provided text."
Mun b’a kanbayɛlɛmali daga ka ķɛ ɛntɛrinɛti kɔfɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Smartphones**.

Here's why:

The text describes the application as being designed to help manage and organize digital information. It explicitly mentions that the application works *on* a phone, and further states it's available on Google Play, indicating it's for mobile devices.  Smartphones are the devices that commonly run these types of applications and connect to the internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kanbayɛlɛmali masinw (Computer applications):** While applications can run on computers, the text emphasizes use on a phone.
*   **C: Kan kibaroyaw tali ɛntɛrinɛti kan (Internet cables):** Internet cables are infrastructure; the application doesn't run on them.
*   **D: Applications minnu bɛ kanbayɛlɛmali a nɔla kulu kɔnɔ (Applications that have powerful functionality):** While the application might be powerful, the text doesn't focus on its specific functionality, but on the devices it runs on.

This translates to something like: ""These are things that are normal; the world is filled with problems, and many people are afflicted by these things.""
* **The subsequent sentences describe the causes of these problems:**  It mentions things like the Earth being tired, the sky being cloudy, the sun being hot, and the suffering of people.
* **The question asks:** ""What is the main cause of these problems?""
* **The text directly states the cause:**  ""Nɛzibin wɛrɛ"" which translates to ""the troubles of the world"" or ""the problems of the world.""

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu na jumɛn bɛ na inafɔ jikuruyurundu?","The correct answer is **A: Nɛzi siminen min ma lamaga**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where a certain type of sickness (nɛzi) is common and spreads easily.** It mentions that it affects many people, and its symptoms can vary. 
* **The question asks what causes this sickness to spread rapidly.**
* **Option A (""Nɛzi siminen min ma lamaga"" -  The sickness is contagious) directly addresses the rapid spread by stating that it is contagious.** This aligns with the information provided in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sira yɛlɛkajigi garolen nɛzi tɛ min na (""The specific disease is the one that is now present"")** This is simply restating a fact from the passage and doesn't explain *why* it spreads.
* **C: Nɛzi hakɛ camanba sira sanfɛ (""The sickness is caused by the spirits of the ancestors"")** While ancestral spirits might be a belief in the culture, the passage doesn't provide any information to support this as the cause of the sickness's rapid spread.
* **D: Nɛzi min binna ka sɔrɔ mɔgɔ ma maga la (""The sickness is caused by the lack of respect for the powerful people"")**  Again, this suggests a cultural belief, but the passage offers no evidence linking the sickness to disrespect for powerful figures.

The question asks: ""What are the ingredients of curry?"" The text explicitly mentions ""spices"" (sogo) and ""herbs"" (koko ji) as key ingredients.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yawuri ani ji** - Yawuri (water) is used, but not a core ingredient.
*   **B: Nafɛnbulukɛnɛw ani nafɛnmuguw** - These are not mentioned in the text.

"Marabolo dɔw kɔnɔ, kokoji bɛ bila nafɛn jumɛn nɔna waati dɔw la curry nanna?","The correct answer is **C: Yawuri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inde ani Pakistan kɔkɔdugu yanfan kɔnɔna maarayɔrɔw kɔnɔ, yawuri be dɔn waaticamana nin curry ye..."" which translates to ""And in Pakistan, the people of the country, the Yawuri, have been accustomed to and enjoy curry...""

Munna mununmununyɔrɔ min dɔ bɛ Transantarctic Mountains kɛrɛ la b’a to i bɛ bɔ fuga kan?,"The correct answer is **B: Nɛzi jalen tɛ sɔn (The route is not fixed)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""U ma makan kosɛbɛ, ola sira janya ka tɛmɛ Transantartic Mountains gɛrɛfɛ walasa ka ta kulu la."" This translates to: ""It is not a fixed route, but the route generally goes along the Transantarctic Mountains towards the South Pole.""

Option B directly reflects this: the route isn't a defined path, and the explorers navigate based on the terrain, including the Transantarctic Mountains. The other options are not supported by the text.

"South Pole Traverse jɔ fɛ, mun taamasyɛnnen don jɔnjɔnw fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Sira McMurdo Station la**.

The passage states: ""P: South Pole Traverse (walima siraba) ye sira kilomɛtiri 1600 ye kabɔ McMurdo Station Ross Sea sanfɛ ka ta Poli fɛ."" This translates to: ""P: The South Pole Traverse (walima siraba) is a 1600 kilometer route from McMurdo Station in the Ross Sea to the South Pole.""

Therefore, the South Pole Traverse *starts* from McMurdo Station.
"
Fɛn juman ma fɔ tɛmɛsiran in kɔnɔ ni turisiw ka kan k’o dɔn n’u bɛ farafinna worodugu yanfa yala?,"The correct answer is **A: Danfaraw bɛ jamanaw ka Visas ɲinifɛw cɛ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the tourist's car broke down, and the people they encountered were South Africans. The passage also mentions that visa requirements can affect tourists and their travel. Therefore, the most logical reason for the car trouble and the encounter with South Africans is related to visa issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yala mɔbilila o ye cogoya ɲuman ye ka yɔrɔ ye minnu tɛ sira dɔnnen kɛrɛfɛ:** While the car is described as old, this doesn't explain *why* it broke down or the connection to South Africans.
* **C: Farafinna worudugu yanfa kɛrɛfɛ jamanaw fanba bɛɛ suma neno:**  This is true (the car is old), but it doesn't explain the situation with the South Africans.
* **D: Mɔbili 4x4 de laɲinilen don:** This simply states a fact about the car, not a reason for the situation.



Therefore, the visa requirements are the most plausible connection between the car trouble and the encounter with South Africans.

Here's why:

The text states: ""UO be seka kɛ mɔbili gansan kɔnɔ nin bolodali ɲuman kli ye nka mɔbili 4 x 4 de laɲini neno kosɛbɛ ani yɔrɔ camaw be sɔrɔ nin mɔbili 4 x 4 sen jan ba dɔ ye."" This means a 4x4 vehicle is *required* for traveling this route. The subsequent sentences reinforce the difficulty and dangers of the journey.  Therefore, the vehicle must be capable of handling the rough terrain, which necessitates a 4x4.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hali ni 4x4 laɲini neno, yɔrɔ camanw bɛ sɔrɔ ni bɛ mɔbili gansan:**  While true that 4x4s are required, this option doesn't address the underlying reason *why* the vehicle must be 4x4.
* **C: Mɔbili woyasi kaɲi kosɛbɛ mɔgɔw ma minnu b’a ɲini ka sirakɔrɔw bila:** This is not directly supported by the text. The text focuses on the terrain and safety of the journey.
* **D: Farafinna Worodugu yanfan lamini jamanaw bɛɛ lajɛli tɛ hakika ye:** The text doesn't directly state that the route is solely for tourists, although it is implied.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O ye ka kɔnɔli kɛ aran na, inafɔ durɔgu kasama wuluw be seka itilize waatibɛɛ la ka sɔrɔ i t'a kalama."" This translates to: ""It is that the police, in addition to regular patrols, use water cannons to stop the violence."" 

Question Q asks *why* the police use water cannons. The passage directly answers this by saying they use them to stop the violence. Option B accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U bɛ se ka soɲa:** This means ""It is that it is raining."" The passage doesn't mention rain.
*   **C: U bɛ sa ka ɲagami mɔgɔwɛrɛ taw la:** This translates to ""It is that the people are shouting loudly."" While people might be shouting during violence, the passage doesn't state that *shouting* is the reason for using water cannons.
*   **D: Famaw bɛ se ka filɛ nafɔ bɔmu farati dɔ:** This means ""The people are setting fire to buildings."" The passage mentions violence, but not specifically arson.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""O ye ka kɔnɔli kɛ aran na, inafɔ durɔgu kasama wuluw be seka itilize waatibɛɛ la ka sɔrɔ i t'a kalama.""  This translates to: ""It is that the authorities, in order to track the movements, use watermarks to track the marks.""  ""Durɔgu kasama wuluw"" refers to watermarks.

* **Option C accurately reflects this:** ""Dɔrɔku kasasama wuluw bɛ se ka utilize kasɔrɔ i t’a kalama"" translates to: ""Watermarks are used to utilize the marks.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jamana dɔw kɔnɔ, sariyasɔsɔlafɔlɔw bɛ se ka ɲangi ni si kaso** - ""Authorities, in order to track the movements, have taken action."" While authorities are involved, this doesn't specifically address *how* they track the movements.
* **B: Jantoli labɛn ka kan ka kɛ n’i bɛna woyase diɲɛ kɔnɔ** - ""People are able to take a look at all this information."" The passage doesn't say people can view the information; it focuses on the authorities using watermarks.
* **D: Fangaw bɛ se ka i ka fɛnw minnɛ i la, hali ni dɔrɔgu t’i kun** - ""The technology is able to trace the marks, even if they are hidden."" While watermarks *can* be hidden, the passage doesn't emphasize this aspect of the technology.

Therefore, option C is the most precise and accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Minfɛn nɔgɔmani juman kelen ma fɔ n’o bɛ se ka kɛ fɛn ye i bɛ se ka lajɛ ka min dilan sɔkɔnɔkɔnse waati?,"The correct answer is **A: Jirinɔnɔ (Tea)**.

Here's why:

The text describes tea (jirinɔnɔ) as a healthy alternative to coffee. It mentions its beneficial properties and suggests it's a good option for those sensitive to coffee. The question asks what the text identifies as a healthy alternative to coffee. Therefore, ""jirinɔnɔ"" (tea) is the correct answer.
"
I ka kan ka ta nin fɛn juman kelen lajɛ sɔkɔnɔkɔnse waati n’i ka dugu dɔnnen bɛ n’a ka minfɛn tabolo ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Jirinɔnɔ walima jirinɔnɔ gosilen fereyɔrɔ**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a cafe that offers healthy food and drinks, including coffee and tea. It emphasizes the cafe as a place for people to meet, relax, and enjoy themselves, often with friends.  The last sentence specifically mentions that the cafe is a place where people gather to talk and have fun.

Option B, ""Jirinɔnɔ walima jirinɔnɔ gosilen fereyɔrɔ"" which translates to ""Tea, drinks, and coffee"", accurately reflects the offerings that would encourage people to gather and socialize, aligning with the cafe's described purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kafe-fereyɔrɔ min b’i ka sigida kɔfɛ** (Coffee-flavored things that are served with coffee) - This is too specific and doesn't capture the broader social aspect of the cafe.
* **C: I tɛ deli ka ta bari minnu na** (It's a deli that serves a lot of food) - The passage emphasizes *healthy* food and the social atmosphere, not just the quantity of food.
* **D: Dumuni fere yɔrɔ min bɛ kamomili te wili** (Tea and coffee that are served with food) - Again, this is too narrow. The passage doesn't say coffee and tea are *only* served with food.



"
Tubani dilannenw bɛ yɔrɔ juman?,"The correct answer is **A: Ani dugu cɛ ye lɛri kelen ni tila ye**.

Here's why:

* The question asks ""Tubani dilannenw bɛ yɔrɔ juman?"" which translates to ""What is the reason for the number of the people?"".
* The text states ""Egilizi kuru kɔnɔ, tuganiw kabaru dilane ɲuman beyi kaburuw sanfɛ."" which means ""The church is old, and there are many people who come to pray."" 
* The sentence ""A be lɛri kelen ni tilan bɔ ka ta munu munu nin wulakɔnɔna kabakoma in na."" translates to ""It is said that the people come from far and wide to visit the church.""
* Therefore, the reason for the number of people is that they come from far and wide to visit the church. Option A accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Egilizi kuru kɔnɔ** (The church is old) - This describes the church, not the reason for the people's presence.
* **C: Eysturoy gun kan** (Eysturoy is the country) - This simply states the location, not the reason for the people's presence.
* **D: Egilizi kɛrɛfɛ** (The church is beautiful) - While this might be true, the text doesn't explicitly state the church's beauty as the reason for the people's presence.  The text focuses on people coming from far away to *visit*.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tagali yen inafɔ kɔfɛ kalanden waaticamala mako toli kuntalajan la ka tɛmɛ tagali yen dɔrɔ inafɔ tile damadɔni turisi."" This translates to ""...the visa is used for the purchase of tourist accommodation and for the payment of tourist services.""

The passage also mentions: ""Jamana camaw fɛ, i mako be se jɛndili sɛbɛn ma kabɔ kalanyɔrɔ i be fɛ kana kalankɛ yɔrɔ mina, ani waari pirewu k'i si yɛrɛ kɔrɔ san kelen boɲɔgɔngola i ka kalan kɔnɔ."" This means ""The country is also a destination for people seeking refuge from war and persecution, and many refugees come to seek a better life in a safe and stable place.""

Therefore, the visa being discussed is specifically a *tourist visa* for people coming to the country for tourism. The question asks what type of visa allows people to seek refuge from war and persecution while seeking a better life.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they don't directly reflect the context provided about tourists and refugees.
"
Jɔni mako bɛ na jɔ kosɛbɛ wisa kuntalajan?,"The correct answer is **D: Baara o kumu kɔnɔ woyasikɛla**.

This translates to: ""Furthermore, the cheap food of the Jamana (people) is appealing to tourists, and the tourists are increasing in number. The Jamana (people) are generally hardworking and are known for their kindness and hospitality to those who come from afar, and they are always ready to help those in need. The small shops are owned by the Jamana (people), and the Jamana (people) who are immigrants are settling in their land.""

The question asks: ""Jɔni mako bɛ na jɔ kosɛbɛ wisa kuntalajan?"" which means ""Why do people come to work in the shops?"".

The text directly answers this by saying that tourists are attracted to the cheap food and that the Jamana people are known for their kindness and hospitality to those who come from afar.  The most concise answer reflecting this is **D: Baara o kumu kɔnɔ woyasikɛla** (People from afar).

"Waati juman, kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnenyala, i ka kan k’i janto sosow la?","The correct answer is **C: Kunkofin kɔnɔ**.

Here's the breakdown:

* **P (The Passage):** Describes a situation where people in Tilamala are facing a problem: they have a shortage of water and must carry it from a well. Ali uses a water pump to draw water from the well, and he sells the water, making a profit because others are willing to buy it.

* **Q (The Question):** Asks what the people of Tilamala have to do to get water.

* **A: Tilemafɛ kalow waatila (To find a better water source):** While finding a better water source might be a long-term solution, the passage states their current predicament.

* **B: Taama la (The ground):**  The passage doesn't mention the ground as a source of water.

* **C: Kunkofin kɔnɔ (The well):** The passage explicitly states they must carry water *from the well*.

* **D: N’i bɛ mɔbili boli la (Because he/she sells water):** This describes Ali's action, not what the people of Tilamala *have to do* to get water.

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that the people of Tilamala have to get water **from the well**.



"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, i ka kan k’i janto mun na walasa k’i yɛrɛ kisi soso ma n’i bɛ mɔbili bolila kunkofin kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Ni bɛ mɔbili boli yɔrɔ nɛɛmalenw la**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Tilamala (a certain person) is connected to the ""kunkofin kɔnɔ"" (a certain thing/place) through a connection (latikɛ). Ali (another person) owns a mobile phone and uses it to contact Tilamala regarding the kunkofin kɔnɔ. Ali often calls people who own mobile phones to inquire about the kunkofin kɔnɔ.
* **The question asks:** What is the reason that people who have mobile phones are often called by Ali to inquire about the kunkofin kɔnɔ?
* **Option C translates to:** ""Because they have mobile phones."" This directly addresses the reason given in the passage - Ali calls people *because* they have mobile phones, likely to communicate about the kunkofin kɔnɔ.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka mɔbili daw yɛlɛnnen to waati jan kɔnɔ** - ""Because their mobile phones are old and their contacts are many."" This isn't mentioned or implied in the passage.
* **B: Ni bɛ mɔbili boli tilema fɛ** - ""Because their mobile phones are expensive."" This is not relevant to why Ali calls them.
* **D: Ka mɔbili jɔ ɲɛ t’a ye yɔrɔ min n’i bɛ tama** - ""Because their mobile phones are the kind that Tilamala used to own."" This is not stated or strongly implied in the passage.

Therefore, option C is the most logical and accurate answer based on the information provided."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin kuma juman kelen tɛ tiɲɛ ye Sunbarbans kukan?","The correct answer is **D: A kɛra mankalanin nɔnma dagayɔrɔ ye ka tɛmɛ Bengal tigiri kan.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kabini san ba 1966, Sundarbans kɛra kunko latolen ye, ani a jateminɛleno ko Bengal Tigiri Ruyaliw kɛmɛ 400 beyi sinsin ani makalani nɔnman 30.000 o yɔrɔ in na.""
* **Translation:** ""Since 1966, Sundarbans has been protected, and its population of Bengal tigers has increased to 400 and the population of wild boars to 30,000.""

This directly answers the question of what the Sundarbans is known for regarding its wildlife.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kunkoba laban tolen b’a kɔnɔ (The population of wild boars):** While the passage *mentions* the wild boar population, it doesn't say that's *what* the Sundarbans is known for. It's just a part of the wildlife.
* **B: A bɛ yɔrɔ min na o datugunnen bɛ ni lɛkɔnɔnan ye (It is a region with rivers and wetlands):** The passage mentions rivers and wetlands as part of the Sundarbans' geography, but again, it's not *what* the Sundarbans is primarily known for.
* **C: Diɲɛ kɔkɔjidaboloba don (It is a protected area):** The passage mentions that the Sundarbans is protected, but it doesn't say that's *what* it's known for in terms of its wildlife.

This means that the Sundarbans forest was declared a national park in 1966.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kunko latolen (National Park):** While true, the question asks *where* the forest is located in India.  The national park is *in* the Sundarbans.
*   **C: World Heritage Site:** The passage mentions it's a World Heritage Site, but the question asks about its location *in India*.
*   **D: Gangtic kulu (Ganges River):** The Ganges River is mentioned as the source of the water, but it's not the location in India.

This translates to: ""For example, it is known, Manchester city, Boston city, Jamaica city, and Sydney city are all a global hub, and **Toronto is also** a global hub.""

The question asks: ""What is the most common reason for people to migrate to England?"" The text *doesn't* directly answer that. However, it does highlight that many people migrate to **Toronto**, implying that Toronto is a significant destination for migrants. Option C reflects this connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mɔgɔ minnu ka kan fɔta dɔgɔyalen ye fila ye (People are migrating for work).** While work is *a* reason to migrate, the text doesn't explicitly state it's the *most common* reason for migrating to England.
*   **B: Demisɛnw (Emigration).**  This is a general term for moving out of a country, not a specific reason for moving to England.
*   **D: Mɔgɔkɔrɔbaw (Immigrants).** This is a general term, not a specific location or reason.



Therefore, option C is the most logically supported answer based on the provided text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsiran ye, mun fɔli ka gɛlɛn?","The correct answer is **C: Daɲɛ sɛbɛniw (Citizens)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jamana dɔw mɔgɔw be angilɛ fɔ kaɲɛ cogoɲuman bala, ani ali na sɔrɔ i be seka a dɔni dalen ye - kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala denmisɛniw cɛla.."" This translates to: ""Nowadays, people come to England for various reasons, and the government is focused on selecting citizens - the best people.""  The passage further describes that these people come to England for work, education, and to start new lives.  Therefore, the focus is on the people who are *citizens*.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Daɲɛw fɔcogoya camanw na (Various reasons):** While people come for various reasons, the passage emphasizes the selection of *citizens*.
* **B: Yɔrɔw (Workers):**  Workers are *a reason* people come, but not the central focus of the passage.
* **D: Dugu kuma kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen (To start new lives):** This is *a reason* people come, but again, not the main point.

Here's why:

The text states that buses depart for Jakar and Bumthang at 6:30 and 7:30 respectively. Option B accurately reflects this information. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The text doesn't say buses depart for Jakar and then travel to a ticket office.
* **C:** Buses to Paro depart later (11:00), not at 7:00.
* **D:** The text mentions Tilebinyafan as a destination for taxis, not buses, and the time isn't correct.

Mun bɛ se k’a kɛ bilasirali kan ɲuman ye turisi ma min bɛ fɛ ka bisi ta karitiye-ni-ɲɔgɔncɛ bisitayɔrɔ la ka woyase ka ta tilebin fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Bisiw tɛ ta ni 8:30 tɛmɛnnen tɛ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Komi karitiye ɲɔgɔncɛ bisiw faleno waatcamana, a ɲinineno ka tikɛ san tile dama damani kabila."" This translates to ""The bus schedule is as follows, and tickets can be purchased in advance.""  Then it says ""Takisiw minunw be tilan ye cogoay telima ani lafiyalen ye ka woyaze gɛrɛfɛ yɔrɔw la inafɔ Paro (Nu 150) ani Punakha (Nu 200)."" which means ""The private taxis are comfortable and safe, and they travel to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).""

The crucial part is the first sentence about the bus schedule. While it doesn't explicitly state the 8:30 time *in the question*, the option A is the only one that is mentioned in the text related to the bus schedule. The other options are not directly supported by the information provided in the text.

Therefore, option A is the best answer.

Option A accurately reflects this information. The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fantan-dugu don** (A city of wonders) - While Tombouctou *is* considered a wonder, the passage focuses on its historical and Arab influence.
* **C: Pankuru tɛ ta yen** (A place of meetings) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Hali sisan a bɛ turisiw sama** (The reason it attracts tourists) - The passage mentions tourism but doesn't specifically state it's the *reason* it attracts tourists.  It states tourists *visit* it.



"

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Dugu in kun ye jamana dugu tɔw kontirɛrili ye, bari  Arabu cogoya kabɔn ka tɛmɛ a ka farafin ya kan.""
* This translates to: ""The city has a historical significance, but also Arab and African influence which shaped its character.""
* Option C directly reflects this by mentioning the influence of Arab and African cultures and history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pankurun tɛ ta dugun in kɔnɔ (The city is historically significant):** While true, this is too general. Option C provides *more* specific details about what makes it historically significant.
* **B: Dugu kɔrɔ don ka tɛmɛ fantan dugu ka (The city's importance is due to its beautiful and unique history):**  ""Beautiful"" is subjective and not explicitly stated in the text.  The text focuses on influence, not just beauty.
* **D: Dugu in tɛ tusisiw sama tun (The city became a tourist destination):** The text mentions tourism *later* (around the time of Diɲɛ Cɛnw Mayɔrɔ Minunw), but the *reason* for its initial importance is discussed in the passage.

The passage states: ""U be fiyɛn baw nati (waatidɔw la kilomɛtiri 100-200 lɛrila)..."" which translates to ""It is a beast that travels long distances (waterways of 100-200 kilometers)..."".  Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U bɛ fɛn girinmaw cɛ u fɛ waatidɔw** (It eats plants and eats water) - The passage mentions it's a beast that travels *waterways*, but doesn't say what it eats.
* **C: U bɛ yɛlɛma ka kɛ antonurayi ye tumamina u be maka tugumakolola** (It is capable of having a strong jaw and the ability to make a loud sound) - While the passage mentions a strong jaw (""antonurayi"") and a loud sound (""tumamina u be maka tugumakolola""), this isn't the defining characteristic of what it *is*.
* **D: Olu ye fiyɛn fitiniw ye minnu bɛ fiyɛn sama kata kɔfɛ** (It is a beast that travels long distances and is known for its powerful bite) -  While the first part is correct, the second part is too specific and not the primary description given in the passage.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, woyasi kɛla kan ka politigi ko cogoyaw kunnafoniw sɔrɔ yɔrɔ jumɛn u bɛna woyazi ka taa jamana min na?","The correct answer is **C: Kabɔ jamanadenw yɔrɔ u bɛna taa jamana min lajɛ**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""I be seka kanu lala ka gɔfɛrɛnemanw ka ladilikanw lajɛ nin i yɛrɛ ta ye, nka u ka ladilikan dilana u ka jamanadenw de kama..."" (It is clear that the governments of the countries of origin and the countries where they arrive are involved...).
* **The question asks:** ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, woyasi kɛla kan ka politigi ko cogoyaw kunnafoniw sɔrɔ yɔrɔ jumɛn u bɛna woyazi ka taa jamana min na?"" (What is the reason for the countries of origin and the countries where they arrive being involved in the political and cultural exchanges between them?)
* **Option C directly addresses this:** It states that the governments of the countries of origin and the countries where they arrive are involved. This aligns perfectly with the text's explanation of the governments' role in these exchanges.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kabɔ jamana gɔfɛrɛneman yɔrɔ u bɛna taa jamana min lajɛ** (The governments of the countries of origin are involved in the countries where they arrive) - While partially true, it doesn't fully capture the reciprocal nature of the involvement. The text mentions involvement *in both* countries.
* **B: Kabɔ yeta minnu bɛ jirala woyazi ladilikanw kɔnɔ** (The countries of origin are involved in the countries where the immigrants arrive) - This is similar to option A and doesn't fully encompass the reciprocal involvement.
* **D: Kabɔ u yɛrɛ ka gɔfɛrɛneman yɔrɔ** (It is the governments that are involved) - This is too vague and doesn't explain *how* they are involved.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni woyazi ladilikanw hakilina ye, mun ni mun man teli ka jamana wɛrɛ mɔgɔ sɔrɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Kɛnɛya asiransi min ye kɔlɔlɔ sɔrɔ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I be seka kanu lala ka gɔfɛrɛnemanw ka ladilikanw lajɛ nin i yɛrɛ ta ye, nka u ka ladilikan dilana u ka jamanadenw de kama, Misali kelen dɔrɔn, Ameriki jamanadenw Muwayɛnoriyan la be seka cogoya camaw ye kabɔ Erɔpeyɛnw walima Arabuw ma. **I be seka kanu lala ka gɔfɛrɛnemanw ka ladilikanw lajɛ nin i yɛrɛ ta ye, nka u ka ladilikan dilana u ka jamanadenw de kama, Misali kelen dɔrɔn, Ameriki jamanadenw Muwayɛnoriyan la be seka cogoya camaw ye kabɔ Erɔpeyɛnw walima Arabuw ma.

Kɛnɛya asiransi min ye kɔlɔlɔ sɔrɔ bɔli a ma**.""

This sentence directly links the ""hakilina ye woyazi ladilikanw"" (rights of immigrants) to the ""kɛnɛya asiransi min ye kɔlɔlɔ sɔrɔ"" (the large insurance).  While the passage then goes on to mention other things (like the role of immigrants in politics and economy, and the use of communication technologies), the immediate connection to the rights of immigrants is the large insurance.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer. The passage implies that access to this ""large insurance"" is connected to the rights of immigrants, which is the most direct relationship presented.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, woyasi suguya jumɛn kelen de ka dɔgɔ kosɛbɛ min tɛ taa woyasi ɲɛnɛbɔba baarakɛla ka dɛmɛ kɔ ka marali kɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Ɲɔgɔn ye baara hukumu kɔnɔ woyasi ka ta dugu la woyasi kɛla delila ka taa yɔrɔ min ka tɛmɛ**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Ali na sɔrɔ azansi camaw be fɛka yɔrɔmara nɔrɔmaliw kɛɛ, woyasi ɲɛnɛbɔba baarakɛla camaw b'u yɛrɛw sipesiyalize kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala woyasi suguya dɔw kan, waaribɔta filancɛ walima lajɛɛkikɛyɔrɔ.""  This indicates that specialized job skills are required for these roles.

The question asks what is necessary for these jobs. Option A, ""Ɲɔgɔn ye baara hukumu kɔnɔ woyasi ka ta dugu la woyasi kɛla delila ka taa yɔrɔ min ka tɛmɛ"" translates to ""Job skills are necessary for people who want to work in the field.""  This directly aligns with the text's description of specialized skills needed for these roles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dɔgɔkun--fila janya woyasi min taa len do waaribɔta kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen dô kosɛbɛ** translates to ""Knowledge – only people who have the required skills can work."" While skills are important, the text emphasizes specialized *job skills* as crucial.  This option doesn't capture the full nuance.
* **C: Woyasi min kanbalan b’a la** translates to ""People who are intelligent do it."" While intelligence might help, it isn't the primary requirement emphasized in the text.
* **D: Woyasi kɛla dɔ ka woyazi fɔlɔ jamana kɔfɛ** translates to ""People who want to work in the future."" The text focuses on the skills needed *now* for these jobs.



Therefore, option A is the best answer because it directly reflects the text's emphasis on necessary job skills for these"

Here's why:

The passage states that while some freelancers have normal jobs, others have specialized skills like accounting, financial auditing, or freelance writing. The question asks what kind of jobs freelancers often do. Option B directly reflects this by mentioning specialized skills and work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The passage mentions freelancers having jobs where they can work from home, but this isn't the *main* type of job they do.
* **C:** The passage doesn't specify that freelancers often work in healthcare.
* **D:** The passage doesn't mention freelancers working in construction or other manual labor jobs.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn bɛ se ka woyasi kɛla dɛmɛ ka jigifabaliya bali tuma min a bɛ woyase ka taa dugu kuraw la?","The correct answer is **C: K’u bɛrɛ bɛn sariya kelenw ma inafɔ u bɔyɔrɔ**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q):** ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn bɛ se ka woyasi kɛla dɛmɛ ka jigifabaliya bali tuma min a bɛ woyasi ka taa dugu kuraw la?"" translates to: ""What is the result of the wind's power, which is also used to make the branches shake, and the branches which make the forest shake and fall down?""  Essentially, it asks what the *effect* of the wind's power is on the forest.

* **The Provided Text (P):** The text describes the wind's power: it makes trees shake, and this shaking leads to branches falling, which then cause the forest to fall. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of these actions.

* **Analyzing the Options:**

    * **A: Ka sigi ni balocogo kelenw ye inafɔ u bɔyɔrɔ** translates to ""The wind and the power of the branches are what make the forest shake."" This is partially correct, but it doesn't fully address the overall *result* or the falling of the forest.
    * **B: Sɔnni ka dumuni nɛnɛ u tɛ minnu dɔn** translates to ""The sun and the moon are always in a cycle."" This is irrelevant to the topic of wind and the forest.
    * **C: K’u bɛrɛ bɛn sariya kelenw ma inafɔ u bɔyɔrɔ** translates to ""The result is the shaking of the branches."" This is the most accurate. The text clearly states that the wind makes the branches shake, and this shaking is a direct *result* of the wind's power.  While the ultimate result is the forest falling, the question asks for the result of the wind's power *on the branches*.
    * **D: Ɲininiw so ko la yani ka se balili** translates to ""The animals are always running."" This is irrelevant.

**Therefore, option C best answers the question about the immediate result of the wind's power on the branches, as described in the provided text.**

"Ka sinsin kunnafoni ni tɛmɛ sira in ye,mɔgɔ suguya jumɛn de se a dɔla ka jigifabaliya sɔrɔ tuma min nin i ne woyazi ka taa kɔfɛ Jamana dɔ la?","The question asks: ""What are the reasons why the people of the forest are afraid and quickly run away when they see the Germans?""

Let's break down the provided text (P) to find the reasons. The text states:

* **""Fɛnw camaw beyi i kan ka min jateminɛ yani and tumamina i be ka woyase ka ta yɔrɔ dɔ la.""**  The people of the forest (Fɛnw camaw) are afraid and run away when they see the Germans (woyase ka ta).
* **""Nin i be woyase, sigi a kana kow tɛna kɛ inafɔ """"so"""".** When the Germans appear, they quickly say ""so"" (presumably a signal or warning).
* **""Kɛjogow, sariyaw, dumuni, sirasariyaw, siyɔrɔ ani baloco sariyaw, kan ani dɔ wɛrɛ tɛna kɛ inafɔ i kun be yɔrɔ mina cogoyala.""**  They (the forest people) also use various signs and warnings (sariyaw, dumuni, sirasariyaw, siyɔrɔ, and baloco) to indicate danger.
* **""O ye fɛn ye i kan ka min bila i kun na, ka jigifabaliya bali walima lala ali yɔrɔ ko kɛ cogow kanu baliya.""**  This is because they have experienced terrible things before, and they are afraid of the Germans because they remember the horrors.

Therefore, the reason they are afraid is because **they have experienced terrible things before and remember those horrors.**

Now let's analyze the options:

* **A: Mɔgɔ min bɛ yɔrɔwɛrɛ dumuniw fɛ (People are afraid of the forest people)** - This is incorrect, the question is about *who* is afraid.
* **B: Mɔgɔ min yɛlɛma kadi (People are weak)** - This isn't directly stated as the reason for their fear.  They are afraid *because* of past horrors.
* **C: Mɔgɔ min hakili ka gɛlɛn (People are angry and vengeful)** -  This isn't mentioned in the text. Their reaction is fear and running away.
* **D: Mɔgɔ min dɔwɔ kɛsɛi (People are terrified because they remember terrible things)** - This is the closest to the correct answer.  ""kɛsɛi"" (terrible things/horrors) accurately represents what caused their fear.

So, the best option is **D: Mɔgɔ min dɔwɔ kɛsɛi (People are terrified because they remember terrible things)**.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{D}$"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen ma tɛ bilasirali kan ɲuman ye taama kɛlaw man tuma min na i be ka woyase ka ta yɔrɔ dɔ la u siyɛn fɔlɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: A ɲini i ka maara kunkokɔnɔna dɔn yani i k'i da duguman.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Nin i bena sigi kɛrɛma, nani sigili dilan ye walima jɔ walasa ka saw, buntɛniw ani o ɲɔgɔnaw gɛn ka bɔyi.""  This translates to: ""As it became more developed, the standard of living, clothing and other goods began to increase.""

* **Option A reflects this:** ""A ɲini i ka maara kunkokɔnɔna dɔn yani i k'i da duguman"" translates to: ""It became more developed, leading to an increase in...""  The implied ""increase"" refers to the standard of living and goods mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gɛrɛli kosɛbɛ bali dumuni la i seli tile fɔlɔw kɔnɔ** (Foreign goods began to be sold following the standard). While true, it doesn't directly answer *why* foreign goods followed the standard.
* **C: Sigili dilan walima jɔ laɲini ne don nin i bena sigi kɛrɛma** (The standard of living in the past was not as high as it became more developed). This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **D: Wari don dunanjigiso ɲuman da fɛ fɔlɔ ni sera** (People began to receive a more advanced standard of living and welfare). While related, option A is a more direct and encompassing answer to the question.

Therefore, **A** best answers the question of *why* foreign goods followed the standard of living. The text implies it's because of the overall development and increase in the standard of living.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...nani sigili dilan ye walima jɔ walasa ka saw, buntɛniw ani o ɲɔgɔnaw gɛn ka bɔyi."" This translates to ""...the advanced and specialized services that are constantly developing, as well as businesses and their goods are growing.""
* **The question asks:** ""Ninnu jumɛn kelen ma fɔ inafɔ fɛn min kan ka gɛrɛfɛ kosɛbɛ n'i bɛ fɛ k'i dege jamana dewelopeni dɔ la?""  This means ""What are the factors that contribute to the development of the modern era?""
* **Option C directly addresses the factors driving development** by mentioning the ongoing advancement and specialization of services.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Erɔpu dumunicogola (European economic capital):** While European economic power is important, the text focuses on *services* and their development, not just European economics.
* **B: Baara ɲumanw (African people):** The text doesn't specifically attribute development to African people.  It focuses on services and businesses.
* **D: Dunanjigiso ɲumanw (Indigenous people):** The text doesn't mention Indigenous people in relation to the development of the modern era.

The original text states: ""Nin be seka woyaze nin ɔridinatɛri walima tabilɛti ye, sɛbɛn kopi dɔ mara memuwari kan walima disiki (min be sɔrɔ ali ni ɛntɛrɛnɛti tɛ).""

This translates to: ""I use my computer and tablet, make a copy of the policy and save it on a disc (which is a backup of information from the internet).""

Option C accurately reflects this statement.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka kopi dɔ di taama ɲɔgɔn man** (The copy is a full text) - While a copy might be a full text, the text specifies saving it on a disc as a backup.
* **B: Ka kopi dɔ ci i yɛrɛ ka imeyili** (The copy is attached to an email) - The text mentions saving the copy on a disc, not attaching it to an email.
* **D: Ka kopi dɔ mara “kabanɔkɔ” kɔnɔ** (The copy is the ""backup"" itself) - While ""backup"" is mentioned, the text clarifies the copy is saved *as* a backup on a disc.

Here's why:

The text explains that to confirm a contract, you need a copy of the contract and also a copy of the email correspondence related to it, specifically the email containing the ""kabanɔkɔ"" (confirmation or acknowledgement).  The question asks what you need to confirm the contract via email.

* **A: Nɛgɛjuruw laɲiniw siratigɛ fɛ (Insurance agreement)** - While an insurance agreement *could* be involved, the text specifically mentions the ""kabanɔkɔ"" email.
* **B: Asuransi baga ka imeyili (Email of insurance)** - Similar to A, this is a possible element, but the text focuses on the email confirming the contract itself.
* **C: Nɛgɛjuruw jɛnw (Confirmation)** - This is too general.  The text needs a *copy of the email confirmation*, not just confirmation itself.
* **D: Kɔntira tigui ka imeyili (Kabanɔkɔ - Email confirmation)** - This is the most precise answer. The text clearly states you need a copy of the email with the ""kabanɔkɔ"" to confirm the contract. ""Kabanɔkɔ"" is the key term.

Here's why:

The question asks which negative size is comparable to the film format used by the ""filimu fɔrima kodɔnlen ba ye"" (the film format used by the film camera). The text explicitly states: ""Filimu fɔrima fitini kamera dɔw be 6 nin 6 cm fɔrima itilize..."" which translates to ""The film format used by this film camera uses 6 x 6 cm film...""

Therefore, the answer is 6 x 6 cm.
"
Ninnu filimu fɔrima jumɛnw bɛ solisiyɔn ka surun DSLR dɔ la?,"The correct answer is **A: 35 mm filimu**.

Here's why:

* The question states that a ""normal 35 (36 x 24 mm negative)"" film is used in standard DSLR cameras. 
* The question also gives the dimensions and resolution of other film formats.
* The question asks which film format's resolution is *closest* to a DSLR's.
* Since the 35mm film is specifically mentioned as being used in DSLRs and its resolution is provided, it's the most likely answer.

Therefore, 35mm film is the most compatible and relevant film format to compare with DSLR resolution.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the reason *why* people use social media to share their daily lives?
* **The passage states:** People use social media to share their daily lives because they want to share news and stories.
* **Option B directly reflects this:** ""Articles, blogs, and stories are shared by people who want to share their daily lives.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Toka sɛbɛni sɛbɛn kɛcogoya taa ni ka segin (Everyone can express themselves freely).** While this *can* be a reason, the passage doesn't explicitly state it as *the* reason. It focuses more on sharing news and stories.
* **C: I yɛrɛ tɔgɔla ɛntɛrɛnɛti siti dilan (It's a new trend on the internet).**  The passage implies it's more than just a trend; it's a way people connect and share.
* **D: K'i ka sɛbɛnin kɛliw dɔnniya taɲɛ (People can have a global audience).**  Having a global audience is a *result* of using social media, but not the primary *reason* people start using it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sɛbɛni sɛbɛn kɛcogoya (Social media)** - While social media *can* be used for sharing, the passage specifically mentions blogs.
* **C: Sɛbɛn kɛliw (Online forums)** - Online forums are different from blogs. They are typically discussion-based.

This translates to: ""For example, Delhi Belly, the plague of Pharaoh, the sickness of Montezuma, and the Spanish Flu.  It caused epidemics among kings, **and the diseases of doctors were also among the most deadly.**""

The passage describes various historical instances of food poisoning that affected large populations. It mentions Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's Disease, Montezuma's Revenge, and others. The question asks *what* these instances are, referring to the *types* of food poisoning.  The passage explicitly calls these historical outbreaks ""Ɲɛnɛkirila kunbalanw"" (which translates to ""epidemics of food poisoning"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maarayɔrɔ banakisɛw** (Influential people): While influential people were often affected, the question asks about the nature of the illness itself.
*   **B: Maarayɔrɔ banakisɛw** (Influential people): Same reasoning as above.
*   **D: Delhi Belly**: Delhi Belly is *one example* of food poisoning, not the general term for all historical outbreaks.

Therefore, **Ɲɛnɛkirila kunbalanw** is the most accurate and encompassing answer."

* The text states that to enter the Schengen area, you need to have a valid passport. 
* Option C directly reflects this requirement: ""Tɛmɛ baliya pasipɔri lajɛli yɔrɔw siyɛn caman fɛ"" translates to ""You need a valid passport to enter.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tɛmɛ baliya wiza baaraw siyɛn caman fɛ** (You need a visa to enter) - While visas *might* be required for some nationalities, the text explicitly mentions passports as a fundamental requirement for entering the Schengen area.
* **B: Wari marali** (A valid travel insurance) - Travel insurance is not mentioned as a primary requirement for entering the Schengen area.
* **D: Furɔntiyɛriw tikɛli hali i ma tɛmɛ pasipɔri lajɛ** (Passports are checked at the border) - While passports *are* checked at the border, the question asks about the requirement for *entering* Schengen in the first place.

Therefore, option A, ""Ka bɔ Nowanburu ka taa Marisi la"" (It is the New Moon of March), is the only answer directly supported by the text.  It identifies the specific time when the water is high and tourists visit.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Turisiw ka bɔli waati** (Tourists come to see the water) - This is true, but doesn't specify *when*.
* **C: Nin ji donnen don** (It is a continuous time) - The passage implies it's a specific time (March).

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...Duroni pani ayeropɔri dɔ walima jamamayɔrɔ kuna tɛ waaticama hakili ɲumanw ye, ali nin a dagaleno i ka maarayɔrɔla."" This translates to ""...In the airport, the security checks passengers and their luggage, and this takes a long time.""
* **Option D directly addresses the question** by saying the time needed for security checks (jamama yɔrɔw dɔrɔn la) and the overall duration (doroni tɛ na sɛn ka jateminɛ - this takes a long time/is lengthy).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka lajɛ fɔlɔ i bɛ sɛn ka min ja ta** - This is too vague and doesn't directly relate to the time for security checks.
* **B: Ka yamaruyalisɛbɛn farankan sɔrɔ** - This translates to ""It is a matter of the source of the farankan"" and is completely irrelevant.
* **C: Ɲininnin yamaruyalisɛbɛn** - This translates to ""It is a matter of the nininnin"" and is also irrelevant.

Therefore, **D** is the only option that logically and directly answers the question based on the provided text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ja ta yɔrɔ ɲumanbaw bɛ min doroni la?","The correct answer is **C: Yɔrɔ falenw na nin doroni yeli ka dɔgɔn**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the reason why people are using the internet?"" (Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ja ta yɔrɔ ɲumanbaw bɛ min doroni la?)
* **The passage states:** People are using the internet for various things, including:
    * Watching movies
    * Downloading files
    * Communication
    * Accessing information (like airport information)
* **Option C translates to:** ""People use the internet for education and entertainment."" (Yɔrɔ falenw na nin doroni yeli ka dɔgɔn) This accurately reflects the multifaceted reasons given in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kɛrɛfɛ jamaw minnu tɛ tɔɔrɔ nin doroni nali ye** - ""People have started to use the internet for business."" While business is *a* use, it's not the primary reason highlighted in the passage.
* **B: Yɔrɔw la ladala nin nataliye tɛ yamaruyalen** - ""People are using it for communication and social interaction."" Communication is mentioned, but ""social interaction"" is broader than the specific examples given (like watching movies or downloading files).
* **D: Yɔrɔw la i ye yamaruyalisɛbɛnw sɔrɔ minnuw kunkɔrɔ ka kɔn** - ""People are using it for a wide range of things based on their personal interests."" This is a bit too general and doesn't capture the specific examples from the passage.

"Ka sinsin nin tɛmɛ sira ye, mankutu jumɛn jamana doninsɛbɛn tɔgɔsɛbɛn ɲɛnabɔli kunkan tɛ tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **D: Yɔrɔdɔw la, sigida dunanjiginsow bɛ sɛn k’i jɔ nin tɔgɔsɛbɛn ye.**

Here's why:

* **The text states that many tourists are traveling to Ghana to visit the slave castles.** This is explicitly mentioned: ""Cogoya wɛrɛw la, mɔgɔw minunw jigileno yɔrɔw turisiw ka sigiyɔrɔw kɔfɛ de dɔrɔn kan ka tɔgɔsɛbɛni kɛ."" (In recent times, many tourists are traveling to Ghana to visit the slave castles.)

* **Option D directly reflects this information.** It says that many tourists are coming to see the slave castles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ni bɛna to turisi jiginsow la, A bɛ sɛn ka kɛ i mako tɛ k’i tɔgɔ sɛbɛn** (For the sake of the tourist industry, they say to build it) - While tourism is related, the text doesn't say they *say* to build it. It just says people *visit* it.
* **B: A ɲininnendow jamana bɛɛ denw fɛ k’u tɔgɔsɛbɛn sigida sariyasow la** (Their intention in recent times is to open slave castles for sightseeing) - The text doesn't state the intention is to *open* them for sightseeing; they are already established sites.
* **C: Taamadenw ka cakɛda taali bɛ sɔn ka ɲinin i kan** (They are trying to prevent the truth from being known) - The text doesn't mention any attempts to prevent the truth from being known.



"
Jumɛn tɛ yɔrɔ ye nin turisi bɛ sɛn ka taa ka tɔgɔsɛbɛn ɲɛnabɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Sigida polisiso (Police stations)**.

The text states: ""Jamana camaw kɔnɔ, nin ni sariya sigu ye, maarayɔrɔ otɛliw be tɔgɔsɛbɛni sɛbɛn ko ɲɛnɛbɔ (jatemina ka ɲinin). Cogoya wɛrɛw la, mɔgɔw minunw jigileno yɔrɔw turisiw ka sigiyɔrɔw kɔfɛ de dɔrɔn kan ka tɔgɔsɛbɛni kɛ.""

This translates to: ""In Germany, as well as in other countries, immigrants are often looking for work (often through acquaintances). Nowadays, many tourists are also looking for work (often through acquaintances) and are going to police stations to find jobs.""

Therefore, tourists often go to police stations to find work.
"
Wɔlɔntɛriya tɛ jɔn nafa ka to taama la?,"The correct answer is **C: Mɔgɔ jigidalen bɛ ka dɔnko kura sɔrɔ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes volunteers who use digital technology to support and help people.** It mentions using digital tools to facilitate communication, provide information, and offer assistance.
* **Option C (""Mɔgɔ jigidalen bɛ ka dɔnko kura sɔrɔ"") translates to ""Digital people who are in charge of communication.""** This directly aligns with the description of volunteers using digital technology to connect with and help others, as stated in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Mɔgɔ min sigidalen bɛ ka teri kuraw sɔrɔ k’a to kɔkan (""People who are digital and support communication in the community""):** While partially correct, it's a bit broader than the passage implies. The passage focuses more on *volunteers* using digital tools.
* **B: Mɔgɔ min bɛ saraba ɲinin la (""People who are in need of help""):** The passage describes *volunteers*, not people who are receiving help.
* **D: Mɔgɔ min bɛ sɔn ka kɛ so nin jiri fɛ (""People who are tired and looking for rest""):** This is completely unrelated to the passage's description of volunteers.

Here's why:

* **The text describes a problem:** The Alakamabaarakɛli community is facing a severe shortage of water.  They are worried about the lack of water for drinking, washing, farming, and general daily needs.  They are also facing hardship and conflict due to this scarcity.
* **The question asks about a solution:** The question asks what the community is doing to get help.
* **Option A translates to:** ""They have appealed to the authorities."" This directly addresses the question of what the community is doing to solve the water shortage problem.  Appealing to authorities is a logical step to take when facing a critical need like this.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: A bɛ na nin baara sɔrɔ sira ye:**  ""They are following the instructions of the elders."" While following elders is important in many communities, it doesn't directly address the need for external help in a situation like this.
* **C: So nin jiriw bɛ di fu waati dɔw la:** ""They are digging new wells."" Digging wells is a potential solution, but the text doesn't mention them doing this.  Furthermore, the description of the water shortage suggests the existing wells might be depleted.
* **D: A bɛ sɛn k’i dɛmɛ ka hakilinata sɔrɔ:** ""They are asking for donations from the public."" While seeking donations is a possible aid strategy, the text doesn't specify they are doing this.  The question asks what they are *doing* to get help, and ""appealing to authorities"" is a more direct and crucial action to take in this scenario.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and relevant response to the question."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun bɛ sɛn ka jati tana ye taama camanna ka taa Walt Disney World la?","The correct answer is **C: K’a ka taama bɛɛ Disney dugukolow kan**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the process of visiting Walt Disney World:

1. **Travel:** You travel to Orlando.
2. **Transportation:** You take a bus from the airport to a Disney hotel.
3. **Tickets:** You buy tickets to Disney parks.
4. **Experience:** You enjoy Disney parks and attractions, aiming to achieve the ""Disney World experience.""

Option C directly reflects the core of the passage: **you need to buy tickets to enter the Disney parks.**  The entire description revolves around acquiring and using these tickets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dɔgɔkun kɛ sogomarayɔrɔw lajɛli la:** This translates to ""It's a simple and easy process."" While the passage outlines a process, it doesn't emphasize ease.
* **B: Ka to kɔkan dunanjiginso la:** This translates to ""It's about a certain amount of money."" While tickets cost money, the passage focuses on *getting access* to the parks, not just the cost.
* **D: ka kari ta ka bɔ pankurun jiginso la ka taa dunanjiginso la:** This translates to ""It's about going and buying a certain amount of a jacket and going to a certain amount of money."" This is completely unrelated to the passage about Disney World.

Mankutu jumɛn Walt Disney World kunkan n’a tɛ tiɲɛ ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Park-hopper tikɛtiw bɛ sɛn ka di taamaden wɛrɛw ma** (Park-hopper tickets are for visiting multiple parks).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Lajɛli """"tigitigi"""" ye ka pan ka Orlando ayeropɔru la, ka bisi ta ka o yɔrɔ Disney ɔtɛli, ka dugunu fila ɲɔgɔna kɛ yani kabɔ Disney dugu kɔnɔn ani ka segin so. Yɛlɛmali cama cogoya wɛrɛw beyi, nka in de ye mɔgɔ camaw kan bɛ min ma nin u kumana """"taali kan Disney World kɔnɔ""""."" This translates to: ""They say 'hopper' and go to Orlando airport, take a bus to the Disney hotel, take a shuttle to the Disney park entrance and enter. It allows you to visit multiple parks, so it's for people who want to experience 'all of Disney World'.""

Option A directly reflects this information about park-hopper tickets allowing visits to multiple parks.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yɔrɔ dunanjiginso yɛrɛ bilalen b’a kɔnɔ** (Visiting several different hotels). The text mentions the Disney hotel, but it doesn't focus on visiting multiple hotels.
*   **C: Kariw bilalen bɛ ye ka taamadenw ta ka bɔ pankurun jiginso la ka taa u ka sow la** (Visiting different theme parks and trying to sow seeds). This is unrelated to the text.
*   **D: Kile camanta tikɛtiw bɛ sɛn ka sɔrɔ sannifeere bɔlɔlɔsiraw kan** (Buying tickets that are only for a specific date). The text focuses on the ability to visit multiple parks, not just date-specific tickets.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kunkow jumɛn ka tɛli n’a bɛɛ ye ko makama k’a la baaradegin kalansow kɔnɔ ani kunnafonigafew kan?","The correct answer is **B: Furakɛlilan fɔlɔw labɛn**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kalan in dɔ bena cogoyala kunbalaw minunww ɲɛfɔra yan nin kunafoniw bɛɛ kalankɛ, waaticama nin baarafamuya tigitigi ye."" This translates to: ""The field is made up of new knowledge and skills that are developed through continuous learning, and the experience of professionals.""

Therefore, the field involves **following up on knowledge and skills**.  ""Furakɛlilan fɔlɔw labɛn"" (following up on knowledge and skills) best captures this meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka sɛn ka bɔ wula kɔnɔ** (Just knowing is enough): The passage emphasizes continuous learning and skill development, implying knowledge alone isn't sufficient.
* **C: Kɛlɛ yɔrɔ labɛn** (Being a child): The passage discusses professional fields and expertise, not childhood.
* **D: Mɔgɔ ladege** (Elderly person): While experience is valued, the passage highlights *continuous* learning, not just the accumulated knowledge of an elder.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kalansen jumɛnw ka tɛli ka ta baaradegin kalansow kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Furakɛlilan fɔlɔw**.

The text states: ""Kalan in dɔ be kɛ nɔrimalema tile 2-5 kɔnɔ ani bena kɛ roli zuye kuna, **furakɛli dɛmɛli fɔlɔw camaw ani waatidɔw la marifa kalanw**.""

This translates to: ""The professional area is normally 2-5 years and involves taking on a leading role, **following a specific curriculum and acquiring knowledge in the field**.""

Therefore, ""furakɛlilan fɔlɔw"" (following a specific curriculum) is the most accurate answer to the question of how to become a professional in the field.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, cogo jumɛn de kayin n’a bɛɛ ye yasa ka jicɛnta kɔsagon?","The correct answer is **C: Ji wili Sanga kelen kɔnɔ**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation:** Someone is repeatedly trying to open a stubborn jar. They try for a long time (many minutes), and each attempt is a little bit longer than the last. They're getting frustrated.
* **The question asks:** What is the best way to deal with this situation? (What should the person do?)
* **Option C (Ji wili Sanga kelen kɔnɔ) translates to:** ""Use a spoon and a little water.""

This is a logical solution to a stubborn jar.  A little water can help lubricate the seal and make it easier to open, and a spoon can provide leverage.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ji wili sanga caman kɔnɔ (Use a spoon and a firm push):**  Just pushing harder isn't helpful; it might break the jar or just not work.
* **B: Jiforogo san (A crowbar):** A crowbar is overkill and dangerous for opening a jar.
* **D: Ji lajɛ cinnifɛn kow la (Use a magic spell):** This is clearly not a practical solution.

Therefore, option C is the most sensible and appropriate answer."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun bɛ ye sɔɔni nin kɛɲɛnko dow hali nɔnkɛla ŋanaw fɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Ka nɔn jikuruw kɛrɛfɛ**.

Here's why:

The text describes the process of fermentation, specifically how yeast consumes sugars and produces alcohol and carbon dioxide.  The question asks what is the result of this fermentation process. The text explicitly states: ""ji funu segin ta be sinsin yɔrɔ dɔnw fitiniw dɔrɔn kuna, ani ji funu telima kabɔ ji duguma be seka nati yen lala"" which translates to ""the sugar in the liquid becomes alcohol and carbon dioxide, and the liquid becomes bubbly because of the gas"".

""Jikuruw kɛrɛfɛ"" translates to ""bubbles"" or ""effervescence.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka nɔn jidawolo kɛrɛfɛ:** ""Jidawolo kɛrɛfɛ"" translates to ""steam"" or ""vapor.""  While heat is involved in fermentation, steam isn't the direct result.
* **B: Ka nɔn badunna:** ""Badunna"" translates to ""sour"" or ""acidic."" Fermentation *produces* alcohol, which is not acidic.
* **C: Ka nɔn ka yɛlɛn wɔyɔ ma:** This option is nonsensical in this context. It doesn't relate to the fermentation process or its outcome.

Here's why:

The question asks ""What is the reason why the water becomes clear?"" The text explains that the water becomes clear because of the presence of tiny particles (nɔnili) that are suspended in the water. These particles scatter the light, making the water appear cloudy. When the particles settle down (due to gravity), the water becomes clear.

Option A directly reflects this explanation: ""The reason it becomes clear is that the tiny particles are settling down, and the light is no longer scattered.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I nɔn teliya la ka yɛlɛn woyo ma** (It is not because of rain that the water becomes clear.) - The text doesn't link clarity to rain.
* **C: I nɔn fan doyi fɛ** (It is not because of heat.) - The text doesn't link clarity to heat.
* **D: I nɔn jijukɔrɔ** (It is not because of something.) - This is too general and doesn't provide a specific reason based on the text.

Here's why:

The passage states that rivers were used for transportation in the past. It gives examples of rivers like the Loire Valley, Rhine Valley, Danube, and Erie Canal used for transporting goods and people. The question asks *when* rivers were used for this purpose. Therefore, the answer is the period of time when this transportation was common. Options A, B, and C all refer to specific rivers, not the general time period. Option D captures the overall idea presented in the passage.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jumɛn tɛ sɛn ka kɛ ladilikan kanunen ye musow taama tɔ yɔrɔ in na?","The correct answer is **A: I yɛrɛ minɛ furukow ɲɛfɔli ma** which translates to **It is a very important issue.**

Here's why:

* The passage describes the problem of the Kɔkɔdugu yanfan fɛ (likely referring to a specific issue or challenge). It highlights its impact on the people of the Sahel region, its effect on the environment, and the need for collective action.
* The mention of the ""tabolo kelenyabaliyaw"" (likely a forum or platform) and the emphasis on preventing intimidation and nominations, and dealing with threats, all point to the importance and seriousness of the issue. 
* The passage concludes by stating that this is a significant and urgent problem requiring diverse solutions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I ka dɔn ko danbew danfaraw bɛ sɛn ka nani kogɛlɛnw ye ka bɔ dugukɔnɔdenw yɔrɔ la** (It is a matter of a particular group being able to control the people and cause harm). While the passage mentions threats, it doesn't specifically say that a particular group is controlling the people.
* **C: I kɔsagon masiri dagɛlɛnw donnina** (It is a consequence of weak government). The passage doesn't explicitly attribute the problem to a weak government.
* **D: Kologɛlɛya kɛ n’a ka kan** (It is a matter of tradition). The passage focuses on a contemporary issue, not a traditional one.



Therefore, option A best summarizes the overall importance of the Kɔkɔdugu yanfan fɛ problem described in the passage."
"Ka sinsin yɔrɔ kofɔlen kan tɛmɛ sira kɔnɔ, ladilikan min bɛ sɛn ka dɛmɛnni kɛ muso taamadenw ma?","The correct answer is **B: Ka bololanɛgɛ kunbaba don k’i ka furu koɲɛ jira.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the problem:** The passage states that the people of Kɔkɔdugu are facing a severe drought, and the situation is worsening due to the lack of rain.  They are also experiencing intimidation and are not being nominated for leadership positions, leading to hardship.  They have created a ""tabolo kelenyabaliya"" (a community meeting table) to address these issues.
* **The question asks about a solution:** The question asks what action the people of Kɔkɔdugu could take to solve their water problems.
* **Option B is the most logical solution:**  ""Ka bololanɛgɛ kunbaba don k’i ka furu koɲɛ jira"" translates to ""To search for a good source to divert water."" This is a direct and practical solution to a drought.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ka lakodɔn k’a manca labatola** (To build a big dam) - While a dam *could* be a solution, it's a massive undertaking and not necessarily the *first* or most readily achievable solution. The passage focuses on immediate needs.
    * **C: A dɔn ko danbew cɛ danfaraw b’a jira k’i ka kan ka** (To rely on traditional beliefs and rituals) -  This is unlikely to solve a physical problem like a drought.
    * **D: Nin kungoɲɛfɔliw m’i diya, sabati i ban ninna cɛw la** (To rely on the help of other communities, hoping they will support them) - While seeking help is good, relying *solely* on others isn't a sustainable solution to their water problems.



Therefore, option B is the most appropriate and relevant answer based on the information provided in the passage.



"
"Ka kɛɲi ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, sinariyo jumɛn mako bɛ sɔn ka jɔ Kunkokɔnɔna fototala ma?","The correct answer is **D: Nin pariki dɔ ye sariyaw ta ka ɲɛsin kunkokɔnɔna fotota man**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how Kunkokɔnɔna photography is used for various purposes, including documenting events, creating artistic images, and serving as historical records.  It also mentions the importance of strategically framing shots and using lighting. The final sentence talks about the skill and knowledge required to be a good photographer.

Option D directly reflects this: ""Nin pariki dɔ ye sariyaw ta ka ɲɛsin kunkokɔnɔna fotota man"" translates to ""It is framing and lighting that allows for the creation of excellent Kunkokɔnɔna photography."" This is a key aspect highlighted in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nin u bɛ dantan fitiniw fotota a dan ma** - ""It is the skill of using the camera that is important."" While skill is important, the passage emphasizes framing, lighting, and strategic composition as equally crucial.
*   **B: Nin forow bɛna ɲɛsin fereli siratigɛw fɛ** - ""It is the application of strategic framing that is important."" While framing is mentioned, strategic framing is just *one* element, not the overarching answer.
*   **C: Nin kunkokɔnɔ bagan min foro bɛka ta min bɛ maloya** - ""It is the Kunkokɔnɔ camera that is important."" The passage doesn't specifically focus on the *camera* itself, but rather the *art and skill* of photography.



"

The passage states: ""Kunkokɔnɔ baganw dɔw sɔrɔli ka gɛlɛ, ani sariya be parikiw kɔnɔ waatidɔw la ka ɲɛsin fototama fereli siratigɛw fɛ."" This translates to: ""The organizational structure is responsible for the clothing, and the system manages the processes that ensure the successful implementation of strategic goals.""  The question asks *who* is responsible for the clothing and ensuring the successful implementation of strategic goals. The passage directly links these responsibilities to the organizational structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I mana bɛn bagan farinmanw ma** (It is the work of the financial managers): The passage doesn't connect clothing or strategic goal implementation to financial managers specifically.
* **C: Kungolo suguya min makob'ala donni** (The simple and cheap kind of cloth): The passage doesn't discuss the type of cloth used.
* **D: Baarakɛli yɔrɔ gɛlɛnman na** (The people who sew clothes): While sewing is involved, the passage emphasizes the broader organizational structure's role in clothing and strategic goals, not just the sewing process.

The text states: ""Yeli be seka dɔgɔya nin ɲɛsi benin walima carili ye walima nin faariyeɲɔgɔn kan ye walima nin gilasi bolifɛn witiriw sanfɛ.""

Translation: ""Glass and water are used to make a very clear and beautiful glass, and also to make a glass which is used for water and a glass which is used for the container.""

The question asks what is used to make a clear and beautiful glass. The text directly answers this by stating that **water** is used. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Yeli dɔgɔyali"" which translates to ""Water is used"".



"
Fɛn jumɛn kelen de ka teli ka to ye takisi sarali ko la jamana caman kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Waariw**.

The passage states: ""Jamana kulu dɔw kɔnɔ, inafo Etazini ani Kanada, sɔrɔ takisi be bɔ jamana kulu yɔrɔ la ani maara yɔrɔ la, ola waariw and bɔndaw be seka yɛlɛma kabɔ maarayɔrɔ dɔla ka ta maarayɔrɔ dɔ wɛrɛ la.""  This translates to: ""In modern times, in the USA and Canada, taxi services are based on the amount of time and distance, and fares and tolls are calculated based on the amount of money the passenger is willing to pay.""

Therefore, the key factor determining the price of a taxi ride in modern times is **time and distance** (waariw and bɔndaw).  ""Waariw"" specifically refers to time.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Cogoya** - This likely means ""distance"" in the context. While distance is a factor, it isn't the sole answer to *what* determines the price.
*   **C: I b'a sara yɔrɔ min** - This is unclear and doesn't directly relate to taxi pricing.
*   **D: Bɔndaw** - This likely means ""distance,"" but like ""cogoya,"" it doesn't represent the complete answer.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q)** asks: ""What is the reason why the currency of the United States and Canada is used when people are making transactions and it is used to pay for goods and services?""  This is essentially asking *why* the US/Canadian dollar is used.

* **The Answer (A)** states: ""Currency is used for exchanging goods and services."" This is a general function of currency but doesn't directly explain *why* the US/Canadian dollar is preferred.

* **Option C** translates to: ""The currency of the time is used when people are making transactions and it is used to pay for goods and services."" This is the closest and most accurate explanation given in the text for *why* the US/Canadian dollar is used – it's the accepted currency for transactions and payments.

* **Option B** (United States) is too specific. While the US dollar is used, the text mentions Canada as well.

* **Option D** is too general. While currency helps with transactions, it doesn't explain the *reason* for its adoption and use.



Therefore, **C** is the best answer because it directly addresses the *reason* the currency is used in the context of transactions and payments.

* **B: Filɛriw jiraliw bɛ jira yɛlɛmali so kɔnɔ ariw ani dɔniyaw jiraliw kɛrɛfɛ:** While exhibits *are* part of the expos, the passage emphasizes the *countries* showcasing their achievements, not just the exhibits themselves.

* **The text states:** ""International Horticultural Expositions ye baara kɛrɛnkɛrɛni ye min filɛriw jira, filɛri zaridenw ani fɛnw fɛn nin o be taga nin jiriw ye. Ali na sɔrɔ hakilinanala, u be seka kɛ san un san (fo nin a be kɛ jamana camaw na), tiɲɛla u tɛ kɛ. Nin baara ninunw be kɛ nɔrɔmalila kalo saba ani wɔɔrɔ nin ɲɔgɔncɛ, ani be kɛ yɔrɔ minunw man dɔgɔ ka tɛmɛ ɛkitari 5o kan.""  This translates to: ""International Horticultural Expositions are major events where green spaces, gardens and flowers are shown and enjoyed. They are also a place for international cooperation (between countries), and they are also a place where people can meet and exchange ideas. These events are usually held every two years and last for about 50 days.""

* **Option A directly reflects this purpose:**  ""Green spaces, gardens and flowers are shown and enjoyed.""  It highlights what happens *at* the exposition, which is the main function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jamana kelen in tɛ se k’'a baaraw kɛ san o san ka tugu ɲɔgɔna** (Countries are also a place to promote cooperation) - While true, it's not the primary *purpose* of the exposition itself.
* **C: Baaraw kan ka kɛ kalo wɔrɔ kɔnɔ** (Events are usually held every two years) - This describes the *frequency* of the events, not their *purpose*.
* **D: Walasa ka sugu in sigi, jamana bɛɛ kan ka sen do a la** (The world is getting smaller, countries are trying to promote themselves) - This is a general statement and not a specific explanation of the purpose.

Therefore, **Option A is the best answer because it clearly states what the Diɲɛ Sugu wali International Exposition is *for* – to show and enjoy green spaces, gardens, and flowers.**"
Ninnu jumɛn kɛli bɛ se ka dɔ bɔ bagan dɔ binkani farati la?,"The correct answer is **D: Banganw bɔli kana dumuni tɔw nɔfɛ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Farankalila, i jant'ala ko kasa be urisiw sama ani kunkosoko wɛrɛw, ola i farati ka nana ni walima ka dumuni kasamaba dilann ani sigiyɔrɔ lajɛya."" This translates to ""For example, people use resin and sandalwood to make incense, or they burn them for ceremonies and ritual purposes.""

* **The question asks:** ""Ninnu jumɛn kɛli bɛ se ka dɔ bɔ bagan dɔ binkani farati la?"" which means ""What is the main purpose of using these woods for ceremonies?""

* **Option D directly reflects this:** ""Banganw bɔli kana dumuni tɔw nɔfɛ"" translates to ""These woods are used for ceremonies and ritual purposes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Binbulu suma dumanw tali i fɛ** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Ɲama labɔli sigiyɔrɔ la** - This means ""People use incense."" While related, it doesn't address the *purpose* of the woods in ceremonies.
* **C: Ka mɛtɛrɛ 25 do a ni luw cɛ** - This refers to the length of sandalwood, which is a detail about the wood itself, not the ceremony's purpose.



"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen ma fɔ ni tɛmɛ sira in kɔnɔ inafɔ kun dɔ min bɛ se ka na ni kunkonɔnfɛn ka binkaniw ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Dumuni dili kunkɔnɔfɛnw ma**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a field that is not productive due to soil depletion. The problem is that the soil has lost its fertility and is no longer suitable for growing crops.

* **Option A (Suma gɛlɛnw - ""It is a good omen"")** is incorrect because the passage describes a problem, not a positive sign.
* **Option B (Dɛsɛ ka yɔrɔ jan do aw cɛ - ""It is that people have eaten it"")** is incorrect. While people might have eaten from the field previously, that doesn't explain the current lack of productivity.
* **Option D (Bagan minnu ma deli mɔgɔw la - ""The field is still powerful"")** is incorrect. The passage explicitly states the field is *not* powerful due to the depleted soil.
* **Option C (Dumuni dili kunkɔnɔfɛnw ma - ""It is the depletion of the soil"")** directly addresses the central problem described in the passage. The soil has lost its nutrients, leading to the field's infertility.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately reflects the cause of the field's unproductive state."
