"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki te kondimama lokola sekele pona kobeta accordeon malamu?","The correct answer is **B: Tika koningisa misapi nayopambapamba pona kobatela bopikiliki nayo.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks how to get a louder sound on an accordion.**  The text states that on an accordion, volume is increased by vigorously pumping the bellows.
* **Option B directly addresses that:**  ""Tika koningisa misapi nayopambapamba pona kobatela bopikiliki nayo"" translates to ""Pump the bellows vigorously to increase the pressure.""  This is the direct method described in the text to make the accordion louder.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pona komatisa volime , matisa makasi oyo ozali kofina na yango bilembo** (To increase the volume, press the keys firmly): While pressing keys firmly is important for sound, it doesn't *directly* increase volume on an accordion like bellows pumping does.
* **C: Kobosana te tango ozali kofina bilembo sala ete loboko nayo ezala pete** (Don't hesitate when you are pumping the bellows, let your hand be fast):  This describes a smooth, fast bellows action, but it doesn't explain *how* to get a louder sound. It's about *how* to pump, not *what* the pumping achieves in terms of volume.
* **D: Matisa vitesi oyo ozali kosalela soufflet pona kobakisa volime** (Increase the speed at which you are pumping the bellows to increase the volume): While increasing speed *can* make the accordion louder, the text says ""vigorously pumping."" Speed alone isn't the same as vigorous pumping.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the given text.
"
"Tango ozali kobeta accordeon , nini na kati na mae malandi ekosunga komatisa volime?","The correct answer is **C: Pression ya mukie (Pressure of the bellows)**.

Here's why:

* **The bellows are the heart of an accordion's volume control.** Pushing and pulling the bellows increases or decreases the airflow to the reeds, directly affecting the sound's volume.
* **Vitesi ebele (Many speeds)** can affect the *style* of playing, but not the fundamental volume.
* **Makasi mingi (A lot of force)** *can* increase volume, but it's the *pressure* applied to the bellows that determines the volume.
* **Koningisa misapi mukemuke (Pressing the keys forcefully)** affects the tone and dynamics of individual notes, but not the overall volume of the instrument.



Therefore, the pressure applied to the bellows is the primary mechanism for controlling the volume on an accordion."
Pona nini foto ya television bandelo na yango ya suka ekatemi?,"The correct answer is **A: Pona kosala ete maloba ekomama (To make the image appear to move)**.

Here's why:

The text explains that TV images are created using a technique called ""surbalayage"" (basically rapid sequential display of slightly different images). This creates the *illusion of movement*.  The question asks *why* the image appears to move. Option A directly addresses this: to create the illusion of motion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na yango foto etondi na ecran mobimba (Because the photo is enlarged on the large screen):**  The text doesn't mention the screen size being a factor in the image appearing to move. While a large screen *might* make the effect more noticeable, it's not the *reason* for the movement.
* **C: Pona kosala ete masolo ya pete esalema na lolenge misusu (To make the light source appear to flicker more intensely):**  This is completely unrelated to how TV images are created.
* **D: Pona kokata maloba oyo ezali kokomama pene na bouton (To record the sound that is coming from the button):** This is about recording sound, not about the visual illusion of motion.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana , likama nini kati na mae malandi oyo moto akoki kokutana na yango tango azali kobongola filme na lolenge ya DVD?","The correct answer is **C: Foto oyo etondi na ecran mobimba (The photo is stretched on the screen)**.

Here's why:

The question describes how DVD players and TVs sometimes distort images. It specifically mentions that when a DVD is inserted and plays, the image might not appear perfectly large on the screen, and video with a wide aspect ratio might not fill the screen properly. This is essentially stretching the image to fit, resulting in a distorted, wider-than-intended view.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Foto oyo ezali komonana te na kati ya ecran mobimba (The photo is not seen in the middle of the big screen):** While image placement *can* be an issue, the primary problem described is the *distortion* of the image itself, not just its position.
*   **B: Kokata maloba ya kokomama ndambu (Expanding the area of the picture):** While expanding might be part of the process, the problem is about how the image is being *stretched* rather than expanded evenly.
*   **D: Kokata bandelo (Stretching the frame):** This is close, but ""etondi"" (stretched) is a more accurate and commonly used term to describe the visual effect. ""Bandelo"" refers more to the overall structure or frame.

Therefore, option C best captures the distortion issue described in the question."
Mapinga ya Grande Bretagne ezuamaki na esika nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Assunpink Creek**.

The text states: ""General James Ewing amemaki basoda ya botomboki 700 na ngambo mosusu ya ebale na Trenton Ferry, abotolaka gbagba eza likolo ya Assunpink pe akangaki nzela mpo basoda ya banguna bakima te."" This means the British forces were stopped at the Assunpink Creek.
"
Mokoloto ya nani ezuamaki na mokanda oyo ekomami na maboko?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The text states: ""Batindaki yango basoda na New York na mokolo ya 9 sanza ya nsambo. Bandelo 25 ya Dunlap eyebana oyo eza kino lelo..."" This indicates that John Dunlap was responsible for printing and distributing the Declaration of Independence."
"Na kati ya bisika mae malandi , Dunlap broadside ekomaki wapi pona mbala ya suka?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The text states: ""Kopi moko ekomaki na Londres na mokolo ya 10 sanza ya mwambe."" (One copy went to London on the 10th of the month).
"
Mapinga ya Colonel Stark ezuamaki na esika nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Na suka ya nordi, na efelo**.

The text states: ""Babengaki pe basoda mosusu mpona kosalisa bango. Basoda balendisaki bisika na bango ata mpe esika ya 1 mpe ya 3 na Hampshire ya sika ya bato 200, na litambwisi ya bacolonels John Stark na James Reed... **na suka ya nordi ya esika ya babotoli mboka.**""

This indicates that Colonel Stark's camp was located in the north of the farmers' settlement, on the edge.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana , na tango nini bato ya Stark bakobisaki kimolai ya efelo na bango?","The correct answer is **A: Na tango babotoli basengaki lisalisi** (When the travelers made camp).

The passage states: ""Gridley to Stark batiaki eloko moko ya pene na 100 pieds (30 m) liboso ya lopango pe balobaki ete moto moko te abeta yango masasi kino baoyo babongi bakoleka. **Na tango babotoli basengaki lisalisi** na lopango, bakomisaki noki bandelo na bango molai na mwa efelo ya mabanga ya mokuse na nordi oyo ezosuka na mopanzi ya mai na mwa libongo ya moke."" (Gridley and Stark set up a camp about 100 feet (30 m) from the river and said that no one should approach them. **When the travelers made camp** on the plain, they were able to set an ambush using the ice from the north that flows from the mouth of the river.)

Therefore, the ambush occurred *when* the travelers established their camp.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eleko nini na kati ya mae malandi ezalaki ya mabe koleka na mboka Chine?","The correct answer is **D: Na eleko ya bokonzi Misato**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Eleko oyo eyebana mingi eza eleko ya Bikonzi Misato oyo ezwaki mibu 60 nsima ya boyangeli ya Han na Jin.""  This translates to ""The era that is most often mentioned is the Three Kingdoms period, which emerged 600 years before the Han and Jin dynasties.""

The question asks which era is considered the ""worst"" in Chinese history based on the provided text. The text connects the Three Kingdoms period with a significant amount of warfare and the formation of numerous smaller kingdoms. This implies a period of instability and conflict. The other options (Han and Jin dynasties, and the city of Xi'an) are mentioned in relation to the Three Kingdoms era, but not directly linked to being the ""worst"" period. Therefore, the Three Kingdoms period is the best answer based on the text's emphasis.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana , bosolo ezali nini na mae matali libota ya bafourmis na ngonga batambolaka kokende bisika misusu?","The correct answer is **A: Basaka bisika ya kovanda na butu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ntango bakendaka esika mosusu, bitululu ya bafourmis batambolaka na butu mpe basalaka camp na moi mpo batambola te.""  This translates to: ""When they go far away, the ant trails become thick and they make a camp to not travel.""  This directly indicates that ants create trails when traveling long distances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bazali na kozanga bilei:**  The text doesn't mention ants needing to rest.
* **C: Basalaka bandako oyo ebongwanaka sima ya mikolo 17:** This refers to the lifespan of the ant trails, not the reason for the trails' formation.
* **D: Batambolaka na moi:** While they do make camps, the primary reason for the thick trails is to create a path for other ants to follow.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini esosolisi malamu bizaleli ya bituluku ya bafourmis na ngonga batambolaka kokende bisika misusu?","The correct answer is **A: Batongaka bandako na Butu (They break up into groups)**.

The text clearly states: ""Libota ya bafourmis etambolaka pe etongaka bandako na yango malembe-malembe. Ntango bakendaka esika mosusu, bitululu ya bafourmis batambolaka na butu mpe basalaka camp na moi mpo batambola te.""  This translates to: ""The ant colony also breaks up and splits into groups regularly. When they go far away, the ant columns break up into groups and set up camp so they don't travel.""

This indicates that the ants break into groups to avoid long journeys, leading to the formation of smaller, more manageable units.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Batamboalaka mikolo 17 na kozanga kotonga bandako (They travel for 17 days and then break up)** - While the 17-day timeframe is mentioned, it's a timeframe *before* they break up, not the reason *why* they break up.
* **C: Babongolaka bandako mikolo nyonso (They forage for food every day)** - This is true, but doesn't explain the splitting into groups.
* **D: Basalelaka kaka bandako wana pona ngonga nyonso ya kotambola (They only do this splitting for the entire purpose of travel)** - It's not *only* for travel; they do it regularly.



"
Nini na kati ya mae malandi ekokoba atasoki ba molongo ezali?,"The correct answer is **A: Bileko endogene (Endogenous rhythms)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bagorloge ya biologie ebalukaka yango moko, yango wana ekobaka kosala yango moko ata soki eza te ata na elembo moko euti libanda."" This translates to: ""Biological clocks are self-sustaining, which is why they continue to operate even without external cues.""

The passage then goes on to mention that these biological clocks are based on endogenous rhythms.  Endogenous rhythms are internal, self-generated rhythms. Therefore, the clock continues to function *despite* the absence of external cues *because* it's based on endogenous rhythms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ritme ya ngonga na ngonga (Circadian rhythm):** While circadian rhythms are mentioned in the first sentence, the passage emphasizes the *self-sustaining* nature of biological clocks, which points towards endogenous rhythms as the foundational basis.
* **C: Lolenge ya nzoto kosala mosala to kokola (The time of day for animals to feed or sleep):**  These are examples of *manifestations* of biological clocks, not what keeps the clock running without external cues.
* **D: Ba rythmes oyo etosami (These rhythms are lost):** The passage explicitly states the opposite: the clocks are *not* lost; they are self-sustaining.



"
Maloba nini elimboli malamu bato oyo bazali komonisa bilembo ya kolandana?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

The question describes organisms that exhibit different forms or shapes within the same population. This is the definition of **polymorphism**.  The text explicitly states: ""Soki bato mingi bamonisi lolenge mingi ekeseni ya ezaleli moko bablobaka bazali polymorphes."" (If many organisms are seen with a wide variety of forms within a single population, they are called polymorphic.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphic:** This is the opposite of what the question describes. Monomorphic means having only one form.
* **B: Organisms:** This is too general. The question is asking about a *specific characteristic* of organisms, not just the organisms themselves.
* **C: Bikelamu:** This simply means ""species"" or ""life forms,"" which isn't the specific term for organisms with multiple forms.



"
Maloba nini na mae malandi ekokani na ba organes oyo evandi na esika songolo pakala?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes polymorphism as a condition where a population exhibits multiple forms or shapes.** This is directly linked to the statement: ""Soki bato mingi bamonisi lolenge mingi ekeseni ya ezaleli moko bablobaka bazali polymorphes."" (If many people notice that the shape of an organ varies, they are polymorphic.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphic:** This is the opposite of what the passage describes. Monomorphic means having a single form.
* **B: Bato (People):**  While the passage talks about people, ""bato"" is too general. It doesn't describe the *condition* of having different forms.
* **C: Bikelamu (Organs):** Organs are the *things* that can be polymorphic, but ""bikelamu"" doesn't describe the condition itself.



"
Nini na mae malandi ekoki te kozala Bozalisi ya nature ?,"The correct answer is **C: Kokende kotala Misee ya sience (Going to a science museum)**.

Here's why:

The text describes ""Bozalisi"" (Wildlife/Nature Tourism) as activities focused on observing animals and nature in their natural habitats. The listed activities (birdwatching, photography, filming, watching films, visiting zoos and parks) all fit within that definition.

Going to a science museum, while educational and often showcasing nature-related exhibits, is *not* primarily about experiencing wildlife in its natural environment. It's a more curated and artificial setting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kotala mai (Swimming)** - While one might swim in a natural body of water, swimming itself isn't inherently wildlife/nature tourism. It's an activity.
* **B: Kokanga ba foto ya ba fololo ya zamba (Photographing wild animals)** - This is a direct example of Bozalisi.
* **D: Mbisi (Birds)** - Observing birds is a core part of wildlife tourism.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ezali motuya pona lolenge ya transport?","The correct answer is **B: Mituka ya bato (Human activities)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people use a lot of transportation to work and travel to places they can't easily reach.  This transportation relies on human-powered vehicles. The passage then links this transportation to the release of a large amount of carbon into the atmosphere, which is a key driver of climate change. Therefore, the root cause of the problem is the human activities (the use of transportation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bisika ya kosala mosala (Workplaces):** While workplaces are a destination, they aren't the *cause* of the problem. The problem is how people *get to* those workplaces.
*   **C: Biosphere ya kofanda esika moko (The biosphere's global impact):** The biosphere is the overall system affected by carbon emissions, but it's not the direct cause of the problem.
*   **D: Lolenge ya bato kokola (Human mobility):**  While human mobility *is* part of the issue, the *activities* related to that mobility (driving cars, using planes, etc.) are the more direct cause of carbon emissions.



"
Biteni oyo ezalaka nzinganzinga ya nucleus ezali na courant ya lolenge nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Courant ya malamu mpe ya mabe**.

Here's why:

* **Protons:** Protons have a positive electrical charge, which is a type of current.
* **Neutrons:** Neutrons are electrically neutral, meaning they have no electrical charge.
* **Electrons:** Electrons have a negative electrical charge, which is also a type of current.

Since the nucleus contains both protons (positive charge) and electrons (negative charge), it has both positive and negative currents.
"
Nucleus ezalaka na biteni boni?,"The correct answer is **D: BaProtons, BaNeutrons na BaElectrons**.

The passage states: ""Noyau ezalaka na biteni mibale - baneutron na baproton. Baelectron ezalaka na courant ya mabe.""  This translates to ""The nucleus is in the center - neutrons and protons. Electrons are negatively charged.""

Therefore, the nucleus contains protons, neutrons, and electrons.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezali ndakisa ya botangi oyo ezali ya mitango binaire?","The question asks to identify the correct answer that represents the decimal equivalent of the binary number 1010.

Let's convert the binary number 1010 to decimal:

1010 in binary = (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0)
= (1 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (0 * 1)
= 8 + 0 + 2 + 0
= 10

Now let's check the options:

A: 1010 (binary)
B: 12001 (binary)
C: 10010 (binary)
D: 110101 (binary)

We are looking for the option that is equal to 10 in decimal.
Option A: 1010 (binary) = 10 (decimal)
Option B: 12001 (binary) = (1 * 2^4) + (2 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 16 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 33 (decimal)
Option C: 10010 (binary) = (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 18 (decimal)
Option D: 110101 (binary) = (1 * 2^5) + (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 32 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 53 (decimal)

The binary number 1010 is equal to 10 in decimal, and option A represents the binary number 1010. So the correct answer is A.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{A}$"
Kombo mosusu ya mitango ezalaka nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Mitango**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""motango ebengami binaire ezalaka na elembo moko kati na oyo mibale, elingi koloba 0 to 1, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - **to bits**, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, pe babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire"
Nini na mae malandi ezali te kati ya litomba pona moyekoli kokoma na internet ?,"The correct answer is **D: Komatisa mposa ya koyekola**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights that blogs:

* **Encourage creativity and self-expression:** ""Bablogs ezopusa bana-kelasi na koyeba makambo mingi ya mokili oyo bafandi"" (Blogs empower students to learn more about the world they are interested in).
* **Promote communication and sharing:**  They allow students to share ideas and opinions.
* **Offer opportunities for extended learning:** Learning blogs isn't limited to the classroom.
* **Develop research skills:** They allow students to investigate topics and build skills in using the internet for research.

Option D, ""Komatisa mposa ya koyekola"" (Enhancing research opportunities), directly aligns with these points. The passage explicitly mentions how blogs can help students investigate topics, use the internet, and develop research skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Komatisa lolenge ya koloba mpe lolenge ya kokoma** (Enhancing the skill of speaking and the skill of listening): While communication is part of blogging, the core focus of the passage regarding internet use is more on research and self-expression.
* **B: Kokitisa kotongama na baninga** (Enhancing interaction with others): Interaction with others is a potential outcome of blogging, but not the central reason why blogging is beneficial for learning online according to the passage.
* **C: Kozala na boyebi ebele pona mae matali mokili oyo bazali kofanda** (Having a broad understanding of things related to the world they are interested in):  This is true, but the passage emphasizes *how* blogs achieve this (through research and expression), making option D a more direct answer.



"
Na mae matali kokoma na internet nini elobami kotinda bayekoli pona komatisa lolenge na bango ya kokoma?,"The correct answer is **C: Kosala ete bato oyo batangaka biloko na bango bakoma kotanga**.

Here's why:

The text highlights that blogs help students ""practice writing and communicating (Toto, 2004).""  It also emphasizes that blogs allow students to ""develop the ability to express themselves and share their opinions.""  This implies that by having a wider audience (people who read their blogs), students are motivated to produce higher quality work and be more careful about what they write because they are aware others are reading and potentially commenting.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kolobelela mbala na mbala biloko kouta na internet:** While it's true the internet has many things, the text doesn't directly link this to motivating students to write well.
* **B: Mposa ya koboya kotongama:**  The text focuses on communication and self-expression, not necessarily overcoming shyness.
* **D: Mposa ya kosala elongo na basusu:**  While blogging *can* be a form of social interaction, the primary motivation for better writing stems from the awareness of a reader audience.



Therefore, the awareness that others are reading and potentially engaging with their blogs is the key to encouraging students to improve their writing and communication skills.



"
Nini na kati ya mae malandi ezali te litomba ya kosolola asynkrone pona bayekoli? ,"The correct answer is **B: Kokutana na bakambi moko na moko mikolo nyonso** (Communicating with peers all the time).

Here's why:

The text states that the advantage of asynchronous learning is that it allows students to interact with peers *at any time*, not just during scheduled class times. Options A, C, and D are not described as benefits of asynchronous learning in the provided text.  The text specifically highlights the flexibility of interacting with peers across time zones and schedules.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya kosolola asynkrone ezali pete te pona bayekoli?","The correct answer is **B: Ba ngonga ya kosala mosala (Task Completion)**.

Here's why:

The prompt (P) highlights the benefits of asynchronous learning, specifically:

*   **Pace:** Learners can work at their own speed.
*   **Problem Solving:**  Allows for more time and thought for problem-solving.
*   **Flexibility:**  Learners can access materials and engage with content at any time.

Option B, ""Ba ngonga ya kosala mosala"" (Task Completion), directly addresses the benefit of working at one's own pace and having more time to process information – which are key advantages of asynchronous learning.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Vitesi ya boyekoli (Learning Speed):** While asynchronous learning *can* impact learning speed, it's not the primary reason it's beneficial. The focus is more on *control* over speed.
*   **C: Bisaleli ya ba ndingisa (Technical Issues):** Technical issues are a potential *drawback* of any online learning, not a reason why asynchronous learning is particularly good.
*   **D: Bosaleli internet (Internet Reliability):**  Similar to technical issues, internet reliability is a potential obstacle, not a benefit.

Therefore, **B** is the best answer because it connects directly to the advantages of asynchronous learning presented in the prompt.



"
Na maloba wana nini etangemi te lokola eloko oyo moto akoki kokokanisa yango na ba ndako ya medieval ya kala?,"The correct answer is **C: Chevalerie**.

Here's why:

The passage describes medieval romances as featuring knights, jousts, and Arthurian legends. It then asks why people are so drawn to these stories and what the appeal is.  The passage *directly* implies that the appeal is the concept of **Chivalry** - the code of conduct and ideals of knighthood that are central to these stories. The romantic ideals of chivalry (courage, honor, loyalty, protection of the weak) are what make the stories so captivating.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Mabulu ya molili (Castles)**: Castles are a setting, not the core appeal. While impressive, the stories are *about* the knights *within* the castles and the world they inhabit.
*   **B: Ba joutes (Jousts)**: Jousts are a spectacle, but they are *part of* the larger narrative of knighthood and chivalry. They aren't the underlying reason for the stories' enduring popularity.
*   **D: Bapunda (Tournaments)**: Similar to jousts, tournaments are events associated with knighthood and chivalry. They are not the core appeal.



"
Na maloba wana nini na mae malandi epatami te lokola solo to mongongo oyo ekoki kondimama kozala bobebi ya ndako?,"The correct answer is **B: Somo**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the deeper meaning or theme (somo) behind medieval romances.** The text describes the surface elements (knights, battles, Arthurian legends, etc.). The question then shifts to *why* these elements are repeated and what deeper message they convey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bitumba (Characters):** While important, the question isn't about the individual characters themselves, but the underlying message.
* **C: Bafeti (Battles):** Similar to characters, battles are part of the story but not the core of the question.
* **D: Basapatu (Shoes):** This is a very literal detail from the description and not relevant to the question about meaning.

The text explicitly asks about the ""makambo ya solo"" (deeper meanings) and the ""mpona nini batongaki liboso bandako ya minene"" (why they keep telling these stories). This points directly to the *somo* or theme of the romances. The final question also asks about the ""mae malandi"" (moral) and if it's just a solo or a complex idea, further supporting the answer of *somo*.

* **The passage states:** ""Ndenge ezalaki na kala, ndako kitoko ya Kirby Muxloe eza ndako ya makasi koleka ndako makasi ya solo.

* **Translation:** ""Since ancient times, Kirby Muxloe Castle has been a very strong and very impressive castle. Its large walls and numerous towers did not fall even when it was attacked by enemies. In 1480, when it was taken over by Lord Hastings, the castle had a chemical brick and could only be defeated by a large number of enemies attacking it.""
* **Explanation:** The passage highlights that Lord Hastings used a *chemical brick* (mboka ezalaki na mwa kimia) which made the castle extremely difficult to conquer. This implies that the castle's strength was tied to this chemical component. Options A, C, and D don't accurately reflect the key point of the passage, which is the *chemical nature* of the castle's defenses under Lord Hastings.

Therefore, option B best captures the significance of the chemical brick in understanding Kirby Muxloe's strength.

Lolenge nini elakisi ete botongi ya ndako Kirby Muxloe ezalaki ya bokeseni na tango ya kala oyo elobami na maloba wana?,"The correct answer is **A: Maninisa minene (Significant damage)**.

The text states: ""Maninisa na yango ya minene ya talatala mpe bifelo na yango ya mike elingaki kobika te soki babundisaki yango na ntango molai.""  This translates to ""It suffered extensive and widespread damage and its stones did not remain attached even when it was rebuilt by the later."" This indicates significant damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fondation etongamaki pona kotelemela bitumba (The foundation was built to support structures):** The text doesn't mention the foundation.
* **C: Ekembisamaki mukie kokesana na bandako misusu (It was heavily rebuilt with many stones):** While it was rebuilt, the emphasis is on the *extent* of the initial damage. The rebuilding isn't the primary reason for its current state.
* **D: Bifelo mikiemikie (The stones are very small):**  The text doesn't mention the size of the stones. It focuses on the widespread damage and instability.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ekoki kozala litomba monene pona atlete oyo azali kolengela saison?","The correct answer is **D: Kosala momesano na salle de sport pona kokembisa eteni ya likolo ya nzoto.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of cross-training for runners.** It specifically states that cross-training (like swimming) is a good way to recover from the repetitive impact of running.
* **The question asks what could be a significant problem for an athlete during the season.**  Without adequate recovery and addressing potential imbalances, injuries are common. 
* **Option D directly addresses recovery and addressing potential imbalances.** Cross-training helps build strength and endurance in different muscle groups, reducing the risk of overuse injuries.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kopota mwa mbangu ya kokima na mboka na tango ya molunge (Running speed work)** While important, this increases the risk of injury if not managed properly and without adequate recovery.
* **B: Kosala makasi pona komatisa vitesi na ngonga ya momesano to exercise (Intense speed work on the treadmill)** Similar to A, this puts a lot of stress on the body and increases injury risk.
* **C: Kokokisa limite ya minute misato (Maintaining a 5-minute minute limit)**  This refers to pace during a race, not a preventative measure for injury.

Therefore, **D** is the most logical and appropriate answer, focusing on a key aspect of injury prevention for runners: cross-training.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ezali ya motuya mingi pona atlete ya malamu ya half-mile?","The correct answer is **A: Kopota mwa mbangu ya cross-country na eleko ya malili**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kopota mwa mbangu ya cross-country na eleko ya malili, elongo na ngalasisi ya biteni ya likolo ya nzoto, eza lolenge ya malamu koleka ya komibongisa na mbangu ya mbula mobimba."" 

This translates to: ""Running cross-country on soft ground, where the spikes of the shoes sink in, is the easiest way to manage the impact on the legs in long distances.""

The question asks what is the easiest way for a half-mile athlete to manage impact. The passage directly identifies cross-country running on soft ground as the easiest method.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kokolisa bopikiliki na esika ya mbangu (Adjusting pace to the terrain):** While adjusting pace is important, the passage highlights the specific terrain (soft ground) as the key factor.
* **C: Kosilisa course nase ya minite mibale (Shortening the course to a time of minutes):** This is about altering the distance, not managing impact.
* **D: Kokolisa mbangu na esika ya bopikiliki (Adjusting the run to the pace):** Similar to B, adjusting pace is not the central point of the passage. The passage emphasizes the ground surface.



"
"Pona atlete , na mae malandi nini ekoki te kozuama kaka na nzela ya koliya malamu?","The best answer is **C: Mosala ya malamu mingi (Significant/Extensive Discipline)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes discipline.** It states that while self-discipline alone isn't enough for success, it's crucial for top athletes. It highlights discipline as a key to training, building resilience, and achieving peak performance.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mosala ya malamu (Discipline)** - While true, it's not specific enough. The text implies that *significant* discipline is needed.
* **B: Esengo ya mingi (Great talent)** - The text acknowledges talent, but says discipline is *in addition to* talent. Talent alone isn't enough.
* **D: Kozala malamu na lolenge nyonso (Being disciplined at all times)** - This is too absolute. The text doesn't suggest constant, unwavering discipline, but rather a disciplined approach to training and life.

Therefore, **C (Mosala ya malamu mingi)** best reflects the emphasis on a high level of discipline required for success in sports."
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi toli nini oyo epesameli te na baatletes ya mikie mpona kozua esengo na spor na bango?","The correct answer is **C: Kobatela mai na kati ya nzoto ngonga nyonso** (Maintaining a good balance in training).

Here's why:

* **The premise (P)** states that a good sleep routine is crucial for athletes' recovery and performance. It emphasizes balancing rest with training and recovery strategies.
* **The question (Q)** asks what *doesn't* help athletes achieve excellence in sports.
* **Option C** directly addresses the need for balance.  If an athlete only focuses on training (A), excessively trains (B), or is overly strict about sleep (D), they are neglecting a vital component of performance – recovery.  A good balance between training, rest, and recovery is key to maximizing potential.

Therefore, option C is the best answer because it highlights the importance of a *balanced* approach, implying that focusing *solely* on one aspect (like intense training) wouldn't be beneficial.  It implies that an imbalance in any of those aspects would hinder progress.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, pona nini atlete ya course ya distance ndambu akoki kosomba esaleli ya talo mingi?","The correct answer is **D: Makambo ebele ya lokuta elobamaka pona bisaleli ya talo mukie** (Many factors are involved in the performance of long-distance runners).

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** Mbango babengi demi-fond ezalaka lisano ya mosolo mingi te; kasi, eza na makanisi ebele ya mabe na oyo etali mwa bisaleli oyo osengeli na yango mpona kosangana. (Middle-distance runners are not as demanding as long-distance runners; however, they have many issues that the athlete needs to overcome to succeed.)
* **The question asks:** Why can a long-distance runner perform a distance run so well?
* **The answer should reflect:**  That long-distance running is complex and relies on many contributing factors.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ezali oyo alingi (It's because they like it):**  While passion can help, it doesn't explain the physical and physiological aspects of performance.
* **B: Emonisi litomba na yango (They are used to it):** Being accustomed to something is important, but it doesn't cover the entire reason for success.
* **C: Ekomatisa lolenge naye ya kosala mosala (They optimize their training method):**  Optimizing training is definitely a factor, but it's not the only one, and it doesn't capture the overall complexity.

Option D acknowledges that there are ""many factors"" involved, which aligns with the overall theme of the prompt about the challenges of long-distance running.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, course ya distance ndambu esengi nini?","The correct answer is **A: Bisaleli ebele (Many athletes)**.

Here's why:

The text states that while the ""demi-fond"" (middle distance) is not as demanding as long distance, it still has many bad mechanics that athletes need to correct. It also says athletes can improve even without great natural talent.  This implies that a variety of athletes participate in middle-distance running.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kozala mutu oyo abandaki kokima mbangu kala (Being someone who stopped running a long time ago):** The text doesn't mention this. It's about the mechanics of middle distance running, not past athletic history.
*   **C: Bisaleli mukie (Few athletes):** The text contradicts this. It suggests many athletes are involved in middle distance.
*   **D: Mbongo ebele (Many goals):** While athletes likely have goals, the text focuses on the mechanics and participation in the sport, not the goals themselves.



"
Nani amonaki résonance magnétique nucléaire liboso? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch and Purcell**.

The text states: ""Ekzame IRM esalemaka na kolanda likambo moko ya physique oyo babengaka résonance magnétique nucléaire (RMN), oyo babimisaki na mibu 1930 na Felix Bloch (oyo asalaka na Université ya Stanford) pe Edward Purcell (ya Université ya Harvard)."" This translates to ""MRI exams are based on a physics concept called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).""

Therefore, Bloch and Purcell are credited with the discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance, the foundation for MRI. While Damadian made significant contributions to applying it to medical imaging, he didn't discover the underlying principle.
"
Na mbula nini diplome ya yambo epesamaki pona bilili na résonance magnétique ? ,"The correct answer is **A: Mbula 1977**.

The text states: ""Na 1977, monganga Damadian asilisaki kosala scanner IRM ya liboso ya """"nzoto mobimba,"""" apesaki yango nkombo """"oyo bakoki kolonga te."""" ""  This directly indicates that the diploma was awarded in 1977.
"
"Kolanada maloba wana, esengeli na bato kososola eloko nini makasi mingi pona kolimbola bizaleli ya komonana ya bato misusu?","The correct answer is **D: Komona (Understanding)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that understanding the needs and desires of others is key to building strong relationships. It specifically mentions understanding the ""mikakatano ya misala na bango"" (needs and desires in their actions). The entire text revolves around the idea of effectively connecting with others by understanding them.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mposa (Forgiveness):** While forgiveness is important in relationships, it's not the central theme of the passage.
* **B: Ntina (Neglect):**  The passage is the opposite of neglect; it advocates for actively engaging with others.
* **C: Kondima (Communication):**  Communication is related to understanding, but the passage highlights understanding *as the foundation* of good communication.  Understanding comes *before* effective communication.



Therefore, **Komona (Understanding)** best reflects the main point of the passage."
"Kolanda maloba wana, kososola ntina esungaka bato pona kosala nini?","The correct answer is **D: Kotanga makanisi ya basusu (Diagnosing others)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that knowing how to diagnose others is important because it allows us to understand their behaviors and the reasons behind them. The first paragraph says ""Koyeba makanisi ya basusu eza ntina mingi. Esalisaka na koyeba mikakatano ya misala na bango,"" which translates to ""Knowing how to diagnose others is very important. It allows us to understand the patterns of their behavior.""

The question asks what diagnosing others allows us to do, and the passage directly answers that it allows us to understand their behavior and potentially help them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosilisa kozanga kondima na mae matali bizaleli ya komonana (Empathy is about understanding emotions based on observations):** While empathy *can* be involved, the passage emphasizes *understanding behavior*, not just feeling what someone feels.
* **B: Kolobela ba mposa (Judging others):** The passage strongly *disapproves* of judging others, saying that if someone constantly chooses to be alone, we should understand why and offer support.
* **C: Kotala bato misusu kozanga ko juger bango (Observing people means judging them):** The passage explicitly states that observing people does *not* mean judging them. In fact, it encourages understanding.



Therefore, **D** is the only option directly supported by the passage.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini kati ya mae malandi na kimukuse ekokani na litomba monene ya AI?","The correct answer is **C: Kolengela ntango (Learning)**.

Here's why:

* The text emphasizes that AI is about machines learning to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It mentions AI's ability to analyze data, recognize patterns, make predictions, and improve over time. This directly relates to the concept of learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kolengela (Programming)** While programming is involved in *creating* AI systems, the core essence of AI isn't just about writing code. It's about building systems that *learn*.
* **B: Bososoli mongongo (Emotional Intelligence)**  While AI is increasingly being explored in areas related to emotional recognition, the primary focus of the provided text is not on emotional intelligence.
* **D: Bosali mosala na mashine yemoko (Task execution on a machine alone)** This is too narrow a definition. AI is about more than just executing pre-defined tasks. It's about adaptation and learning.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi oyo elandana mingi na AI?","The correct answer is **B: Kobongisa mpe kolengela ba ngonga ya mosala (Troubleshooting and improving operational efficiency)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that AI is used for:

* **Bandakisa ezotalela mpe kolandela:** (Detecting and monitoring)
* **Kozwa mikano pe kobongisa makambo:** (Making predictions and fixing problems)
* **Kokokisa bamposa ya bakiliya mpe kopesa biyano na mituna na bango:** (Improving customer service and providing services to them)
* **Koyeba makambo bakomi na maboko, mongongo mpe elongi:** (Understanding what people do, think, and feel)

All of these points relate to **troubleshooting and improving operational efficiency** of systems and processes. While AI can *contribute* to customer service (option A), the passage's focus is broader than just that. Options C and D are irrelevant.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ezalaka makasi ya moto oyo azalaka na ndenge ya kokanisa","The correct answer is **A: Kopona biyano ebele ya malamu na kati ya likambo songolo pakala** (Creating many subtle nuances within the overall whole).

Here's why:

The passage describes a specific type of healer who works with the subtle energies of the body.  They don't just focus on obvious symptoms but delve into the interconnectedness of things. They are skilled at:

* **Speed, precision, and intuition:**  This implies a nuanced understanding beyond surface-level observation.
* **Understanding the subtle body:**  This points to a sensitivity to subtle energies and patterns.
* **Releasing old energy:** This suggests a process of unearthing hidden influences.
* **Working with a single point of imbalance:**  This implies identifying and addressing very fine disturbances.

Option A, ""Creating many subtle nuances within the overall whole,"" best encapsulates this.  The healer doesn't just address the visible problem but explores the intricate web of subtle energies to understand the root cause and create balance.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kosalela balolenge ebele na kati ya likambo** (Applying many remedies within the whole): While remedies are involved, the focus is not simply *applying* them but *understanding* the nuances that make each remedy appropriate.
* **C: Kozua ngonga oyo esengeli pona kozua eyano na likambo** (Creating the necessary foundation to create a whole): This focuses on foundational work, which is important, but doesn't fully capture the subtle, nuanced approach described.
* **D: Lolenge ya kobomba makambo na kati ya mayele** (The art of balancing things within the whole):  Balancing is *part* of the process, but the passage emphasizes the *depth* of understanding and the subtle energies that lead to balance, not just the balancing act itself.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi endimami te kotalela makasi ndenge ya kokanisa?","The correct answer is **A: Kososola ete eyano ya malamu ezali kaka moko** (Believing that the cause of the illness is only one).

Here's why:

The passage describes a specific approach to diagnosis and treatment where the belief is that there's only one underlying cause for an illness.  The question asks what *prevents* someone from using this approach.  If someone believes the illness has multiple causes, they wouldn't follow this single-cause approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kozua ngonga oyo esengeli** (Ignoring necessary information): While ignoring information is bad, it's not the core reason someone wouldn't use this diagnostic approach. The fundamental issue is the underlying *belief* about the number of causes.
* **C: Kososola bosolo** (Ignoring symptoms): Similar to B, ignoring symptoms is not the primary reason.
* **D: Kosangisa ba nsango** (Consulting with other doctors): Consulting with others doesn't inherently prevent someone from using this approach. They might consult to confirm their single-cause diagnosis.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ekoki te kondimama lokola micro-expresion?","The correct answer is **C: Kobetabeta miso mbangu mbangu (Frowning the fingers repeatedly)**.

Here's why:

* **Microexpressions** are fleeting, involuntary facial expressions that reveal a person's true emotions, often lasting only a fraction of a second. They are subtle and difficult to control.

Let's analyze why the other options are less likely to be microexpressions:

* **A: Kotala pembeni na ngonga ya kosolola (Looking sideways while smiling):** While unusual, this is a more noticeable and deliberate action than a microexpression.
* **B: Kozipazipa miso (Clasping hands):**  This is a gesture, not a facial expression.
* **D: Komatisa mosapi munene ya loboko likolo (Making a large hand gesture):** This is a very obvious and deliberate action, definitely not a microexpression.

Frowning the fingers repeatedly (or any repetitive, subtle, and involuntary finger movement) could potentially be a microexpression related to frustration, annoyance, or other emotions.  It's the most plausible option among those provided. Therefore, **C** is the best fit.



"
Na maloba ya bolimboli micro-expresion mae malandi nini ezali solo te?,"The correct answer is **D: Ekoki kosalisa komeka bosolo (It can reveal the truth)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how micro-expressions, which are very brief facial expressions, can reveal someone's true feelings, even if they are trying to hide them.  Oliver Sacks' work is cited as evidence of this. Therefore, the core idea is that these subtle expressions *reveal the truth* about what someone is thinking or feeling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosala enregistrement ya video emema makambo mingi te (Recording video is not that much):** This is irrelevant to the main point about micro-expressions.
* **B: Bolimboli ya malamu ekoki komonisa lokuta (Micro-expressions can be misleading):** The passage implies the *opposite* – that they can *reveal* the truth.
* **C: Maloba mpe bizaleli ya elongi esosolami malamu (Speech and actions are not necessarily truthful):** While the passage implies that speech can be deceptive, the main focus is on how micro-expressions *reveal* underlying truth, despite deceptive speech.



"
Na mae malandi nini ekomaki ya motuya mingi kouta na Renaissance? ,"The correct answer is **C: Mayele ya kokanisa makomi (The desire to reconcile the sacred and the profane).**

Here's why:

The passage discusses a shift in how people approach knowledge and understanding. It highlights the increasing importance of reconciling seemingly contradictory ideas.  The Renaissance was a period deeply marked by a desire to bridge the gap between religious dogma (the sacred) and classical learning and humanism (the profane).  Artists, thinkers, and scientists sought to integrate these aspects of life and knowledge, leading to groundbreaking developments in art, science, and philosophy.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Mayele ya kokanisa (The desire to reconcile):** While the desire to reconcile is *part* of the Renaissance, it's not specific enough.  It doesn't pinpoint the core tension being addressed.
*   **B: Boyebi ya kobalukabaluka (The understanding of chaos):** The Renaissance was not primarily driven by an understanding of chaos. It was about order and integration, not embracing disorder.
*   **D: Bozui bansango (You are wrong):** This is irrelevant to the question and not an option representing a key aspect of the Renaissance.



"
"Kolanda boyei ya kobotama lisusu , eloko nini na mae malandi ezuamaki lisusu na litomba mingi te?","The correct answer is **C: Mayele ya kokanisa makomi**.

Here's why:

The text states that while the desire to be understood (knowing how to explain things) is important, the desire to **be heard and understood by others (mayele ya kokanisa makomi)** is even stronger. The text emphasizes that communication and understanding are greatly enhanced when people feel heard and understood.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Mayele ya kokanisa (The desire to explain):** While mentioned as important, the text explicitly states that the desire to be understood by *others* is stronger.
*   **B: Bozui boyebi (Having understanding):** This is a consequence of communication, not the primary driving force.
*   **D: Bopanzi ya bansango (The power of the community):** While community plays a role, the question focuses on what *within the individual* is most significant in the desire to be understood.



"
Na mae malandi nini emonisi te ntina ya kosalela internet pona bokobi ya ba relations ?,"The correct answer is **D: Kokutana na bato ya sika (Connecting with people)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""koyekola"" (connecting) and ""kosangana na basusu"" (meeting many people) are major motivations for using the internet.  The question asks for the reason people use the internet for relationships. Therefore, ""kokutana na bato ya sika"" directly aligns with the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bosali mombongo (Loneliness):** While loneliness *can* be a reason to connect with others, the text doesn't specifically mention loneliness as a motivation for internet use.
* **B: Kosolola na libota ngonga nyonso (To browse the entire world):** The text mentions browsing, but it's not presented as the primary reason for internet use related to relationships.
* **C: Kosala bulukiluki pona mibembo (To search for information for research):** This is about information gathering, not about social relationships.



"
Na mae malandi nini emonisi te ntina ya kosalela internet pona makambo ya moto yemoko?,"The correct answer is **A: Kotala lolenge ya kosala eloko (Understanding how to do things)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na ndaksisa, emonani ete """"koyekola"""" pe """"kosangana na basusu"""" elendisaka mingi na kosalela internt (James et al., 1995). Bamonaki pe ete “komipesa na yo moko” mpe “kokoba boyokani” eza na kati ya bilendiseli ya sika ya Eighmey na McCord (1998) ntango bazolandela ndenge bato bazotalela basite internet.""

This translates to: ""In summary, it is seen that """"finding out"""" and """"connecting with others"""" greatly motivate internet use (James et al., 1995). They also found that “self-expression” and “knowledge sharing” are among the key motivations of internet users (Eighmey and McCord's, 1998) when they observe how people use websites.""

The question asks what *doesn't* motivate internet use for individuals. Options B, C, and D all relate to technical aspects of the internet, which might be relevant for some users but aren't core motivators for *everyone*.  However, the text highlights that people are motivated by finding solutions and connecting with others. Therefore, the least likely motivator for a single person to use the internet would be understanding *how* to do something (solving a problem).  Someone might use the internet for connection or self-expression without necessarily focusing on technical details or learning new skills.



"
Na ngonga nini Erope ya Est etikaki kolanda makasi bizaleli ya basusu mpe kobanda kosala makambo lolenge na yango moko?,"The correct answer is **D: Na ekeke to siècle ya 11**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the middle ages saw Western Europe start to model itself after Eastern Europe.  
* It specifically mentions that around the 11th century, the West began to emulate the East. 
* The passage also suggests that the difference in ""intellectual development"" between East and West narrowed significantly around this time, prompting the Crusades and increased contact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na ngonga ya moyen Age (During the Middle Ages):** While the Middle Ages is the general period, it's too broad. The passage pinpoints a more specific time.
* **B: Na ngonga ya Byzantine (During the Byzantine period):**  This is incorrect because the question asks when the *West* started to catch up, not when the Byzantines were at their peak. The passage indicates a shift in influence from East to West.
* **C: Mbula 25 sima ya moyen age (25 years into the Middle Ages):** The passage doesn't give a specific time frame within the Middle Ages; it mentions a century.



"
Kosalela babutons pona kokanga bilamba ezalaki eyano kouta wapi? ,"The correct answer is **C: The Crusades**.

Here's why:

The text states that the development of Gothic models in Western Europe was significantly influenced by the Byzantine models, but that it took a while for the West to catch up (a delay of 25-30 years).  The text then explicitly says that the desire to catch up and demonstrate superiority led to the Crusades and the subsequent adoption of pointed arches to achieve greater height.

Therefore, the adoption of pointed arches (and thus, the reason for the delay in catching up) is directly linked to the Crusades.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezuami kozala eyano pona ngonga molai na mae matali mikakatano ya esika tofandaka?","The correct answer is **C: Kososola ba ntina ya ba problemes (Solving the root causes of the problems)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that simply treating the symptoms (like giving medicine) isn't enough.** It stresses the importance of understanding and addressing the underlying issues (""makambo euti"" - the root causes) to achieve lasting solutions.  The passage talks about a global environment where scientific and technological advances are driving growth, but also creating complex problems and increasing mental health challenges. Addressing the root causes is the key to dealing with those challenges.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as directly supported by the passage:

* **A: Kotika bomoi ya mindondo (Promoting mental health)** - While important, promoting mental health is a *result* of solving the root causes, not the primary action the passage advocates.
* **B: Activisme to kmisusu lolenge ya kobika (Activism or advocating for change)** - Advocacy can be part of the solution, but the passage focuses more on the *action* of solving problems themselves.
* **D: Kokoma moninga ya Makita pona esika tofandaka (Maintaining a positive outlook about the problems)** - A positive outlook is helpful, but the passage highlights the need for *action* and *problem-solving*, not just a positive attitude.



Therefore, **C** aligns most closely with the core message of the passage: tackling the root causes of the issues we face.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya biyano elandi eyano nini ekoki te kondimama lokola eyano pona ngonga mokuse na mikakatano ya esika tofandaka?","The correct answer is **B: Kolongola ebandeli ya mikakatano**.

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the rapid advancement of science and technology and the resulting increase in complexity.** This complexity is the root of the problem discussed.
* **The question asks how to address this complexity.**
* **Option B, ""Kolongola ebandeli ya mikakatano"" (Understand the underlying causes of complexity), directly addresses the core issue.**  To solve a complex problem, you need to understand *why* it's complex in the first place. This implies investigation, research, and analysis – essentially understanding the mechanisms at play.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kosala activisme (Practice activism):** While activism can be important, it's a *response* to a problem, not a direct solution to its underlying complexity.
* **C: Kolobela mae matali lolenge ya kobika bomoi ya mindondo (Promote education about how to maintain mental well-being):**  Mental well-being is important, but it's a *consequence* of dealing with complexity, not a way to solve it. This is addressing symptoms, not the root cause.
* **D: Kobika malamu na esika tofandaka (Be prudent in the places where we find ourselves):**  Prudence is good advice, but it's a reactive measure, not a proactive solution to increasing complexity. It doesn't address the underlying reasons for the problem.



Therefore, understanding the underlying causes of complexity (B) is the most logical and effective way to deal with the issue presented in the passage.



"
Na Mboka nini bitumba ebandaki liboso na Erope oyo likambo ya makasi ezalaki kowela kibokonzi koleka makambo ya mangomba ?,"The correct answer is **D: Espagne (Spain)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bitumba ya kokitana ya Espagne ezalaki bitumba ya liboso oyo likambo bazalaki kowela ezalaki kokabola bokonzi."" This translates to: ""The territorial expansion of Spain was the first thing that started to erode the balance of power.""
"
Etumba nini tango mosusu ezuamaka lokola “etumba ya mangomba” ya suka?,"The correct answer is **C: Etumba ya bokatikati mboka espagne**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bitumba ya kokitana ya Espagne ezalaki bitumba ya liboso oyo likambo bazalaki kowela ezalaki kokabola bokonzi."" This translates to ""The meeting places of Spain were always places where things were moving, and the thing they were moving towards was the breakdown of unity.""

The question asks where ""etumba ya mangomba"" (a sign of breakdown) is most often found.  The text directly links the breakdown of unity to the meeting places in Spain. Therefore, the ""etumba ya mangomba"" is most strongly associated with the breakdown of unity *in* Spain.
"
Na mae malandi eteni nini ya Lingomba Katolike ezalaki kotalema te?,"The correct answer is **C: Bolembisi ya kibokonzi na Lingomba (The teaching of the Church)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the centralized authority of the Catholic Church, particularly the Pope in Rome. It states: ""Bokonzi monene ya lingomba ezalaka na Roma banda bambula koleka nkoto moko mpe kotia bokonzi mpe mbongo esika moko ebimisa mituna mingi bazotosa mobeko wana."" (The great authority of the Church is in Rome, where it gathers itself and gives authority and doctrine, and all the faithful must obey this authority.)

This directly relates to the teaching (bolembisi) of the Church. The passage implies that the Church's teachings are paramount and should be obeyed, implying that the church's teachings are not open to interpretation or change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soki bokaboli mosolo na lingomba ezalaki malamu (If the faith in the Church is weak):** While a weak faith might be a concern, the passage doesn't state that it's *not* a characteristic of the Church. It focuses on the strength and authority of the Church.
* **B: Soki mibeko ya motuya ya lingomba ekokaki kobongolama (If the rules of the Church can be interpreted):** The passage implies the opposite - that the rules (mibeko ya motuya) are not open to interpretation.
* **D: Soki mibeko ya motuya ya Lingomba ezalaki kotosama (If the rules of the Church are changing):**  Similar to B, the passage implies the rules are not changing. The emphasis is on a consistent and unified doctrine.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani babomaki ye na Versailles?","The correct answer is **C: Moko na kati ya likita**.

The text states: ""moto moko na kati ya bato ya mobulu aningisaki moto ya soda moko ya mokonzi oyo babomaki ye na Versailles liboso ya mokonzi-mwasi oyo azalaki kobanga makasi."" This translates to ""a person among the mob threw a stone at the king that was thrown at him in Versailles.""  ""Bato ya mobulu"" means ""the crowd/mob"" and ""moko na kati ya likita"" means ""a person among the crowd.""
"
Kati ya mae malandi nini oyo etuluku ya bato etindaki te mokonzi mpe mwasi naye basala na makasi?,"The correct answer is **D: Mobembo kozonga Paris**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Na calèche, bazongaki na Paris bazingami na etuluku monene ya bato oyo bazalaki kotia makelele pe koloba maloba ya kobangisa mokonzi mobali pe mokonzi mwasi.""  This translates to: ""In a carriage, they went to Paris accompanied by a large crowd of people who were shouting slogans calling for the king and queen to be united.""  The large crowd and their shouts directly led to the royal family's forced relocation to Paris.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kofongola maninisa ya motuka na bango (Stripping them of their royal privileges):** While the eventual loss of privileges *did* happen, the immediate cause of the mob's anger and the forced move wasn't the stripping of privileges, but the demand for unity and the overwhelming crowd.
* **B: Kolongwa Versailles na lombango (Being forcibly removed from Versailles):**  This is a consequence of the move to Paris, not the initial reason the crowd acted.  They were *going* to Paris, not being forcibly removed from Versailles.
* **C: Kotala lolenge mokengeli azali kokatema kingo (Seeing a single drop of blood cause a great uproar):** The passage mentions a soda of blood, not a single drop, and while this contributed to the rising tension, it wasn't the main factor driving the relocation to Paris. The crowd's overall demands and actions were more significant.



"
Na mae malandi nini ezalaki te na kati ya boyokani ya Mboka Grande Bretagne pona Bitumba ya masuwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mposa ya Mboka Alemgane pona kolandela lolenge moko ya kosala etumba**

Here's why:

The passage states that the UK preferred the German method of brewing beer, which involved a single fermentation process. This contrasts with the more complex fermentation methods used in the UK, which required more time and resources. The passage explicitly says that the German method was seen as more efficient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bamasuwa oyo ezalaki kosala te etiamaki pembeni** (The brewers did not work separately): The passage doesn't mention how the brewers worked together or separately.
* **C: Mbongwana esalemaki na mibeko ya bikolo** (The brewing process was based on ancient traditions): While the UK might have valued tradition, the passage focuses on the *efficiency* of the German method, not ancient traditions.
* **D: Balisungi ya motuya ezalaki te** (The brewers were not skilled): The passage doesn't mention anything about the skill level of the brewers.



Therefore, option A directly addresses the reason why the German brewing method was favored – its efficiency due to a single fermentation process."
Maloba nini elobi malamu te lolenge oyo Grande Grande Bretagne epekisaki bamasuwa ya Alemagne ?,"The correct answer is **A: Eboyaki kotosa mibeko ya bikolo (It was trying to break the existing regulations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Great Britain was trying to ""break the rules"" (""ekataki blei ya basoda pe ya basivile, atako kokanga biloko wana ebukaki mibeko endimami na mikili mingi""). This refers to regulations and restrictions on imports, specifically concerning the types of goods that could be brought into the country.  The passage explains that this was because the regulations were hindering the flow of goods and limiting access to a wider variety of products, even those from other countries.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Elamusaki bamasuwa ya Alemagne pona bitumba (It was attacking German merchants for goods):** The passage doesn't say they were attacking merchants. They were creating regulations *affecting* German merchants.
* **C: Epekisaki balisungi ya Alemagne kokende (It was encouraging German merchants to leave):** The passage indicates the opposite – the regulations were *hindering* trade, not encouraging departure.
* **D: Esalaki ete bamasuwa oyo ezalaki ya mboka moko te ezala na kaka te (It was saying that goods from only one country shouldn't be available):** While the passage discusses limiting imports from specific countries (like Germany) it does not make this point."
"Kolanda maloba wana, epai na nani bokono ya sclérose en plaques ekoki kozuama ?","The answer is **C: Mobange mobali ya mbula 43**.

Here's why:

The question asks who is most likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS), given the information in the prompt. The prompt states: ""Bolukiluki emoni ete basi baza na bachance mbala mibale koleka mibali ya kobela MS.""  This translates to ""The incidence shows that women are 2 to 3 times more likely to develop MS than men.""

Among the options, only option C, ""Mobange mobali ya mbula 43"" (a 43-year-old woman) represents a woman.  Therefore, she has a higher likelihood of developing MS based on the information provided. The other options are either men or younger individuals.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bato basalaka mosala ya mbala na mbala basengeli na lisungi pona nini?","The correct answer is **A: Emoneli mabe pona mae matali pasi** (They should be careful because of the problems).

Here's why:

The provided text explains that individuals who engage in sexual activity frequently are more likely to have problems related to their sexual health and that frequent sex doesn't necessarily mean it's not harmful.  Therefore, they should be careful (emoneli mabe) because of the potential problems (mae matali pasi).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loketo** (Because of pleasure): While pleasure might be a factor, the text focuses on *problems* associated with frequent sex.
* **C: Kozanga esengo** (To be respectful): Respect is important, but the core reason highlighted in the text is the potential for health issues.
* **D: Somo** (Topic/Subject): This is not a reason why people should be careful.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, masano ya escrime ebetamaka ndenge nini?","The correct answer is **B: Na Universite** (At the University).

Here's why:

The question asks *where* fencing competitions take place frequently. The first sentence states that fencing competitions happen often with many people, including university students and people who know and support Olympique. The phrase ""banivo mingi bazotanga na universite"" translates to ""many people compete at the university.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na lolenge ya sika (In the streets):** The text doesn't mention fencing happening in the streets.
* **C: Na Olimpique (At the Olympics):** While Olympique is mentioned as a supportive group, the text doesn't say competitions *always* happen at the Olympics. It's more about supporters of Olympique being involved.
* **D: No lolenge ya bitumba (In a stadium):** The text doesn't mention stadiums as a common venue for these competitions.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ekoki kozala elembo makasi kolakisa ngenge ya kati ya nzoto?","The correct answer is **A: Mposa ya kosanza mpe fievre (Diarrhea and fever)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a central intestinal infection often manifests with diarrhea and fever. Options B, C, and D, while potentially symptoms of other illnesses, aren't specifically linked to central intestinal infections as strongly as diarrhea and fever are according to the provided text."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ezali eloko ya yambo oyo esengeli kosala na ngonga ya kosunga victime?","The correct answer is **A: Kotala esika likama esalemi (Leave the scene)**.

Here's why:

The initial text emphasizes that if you witness someone being assaulted, you should **not** interfere directly, especially if you are not trained. The key advice is to **ensure the safety of the victim and yourself**, and the safest course of action is to **remove yourself from the immediate danger** and then **call for help (police, medical assistance).**

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kopusana pembeni ya victime (Stand beside the victim):** This could put you in danger and potentially escalate the situation.
* **C: Kotala position ya victime (Take the victim's position):** This is dangerous and could make you a target.
* **D: Kozela lisungi (Offer a bandage):** While offering comfort is important *after* the immediate danger has passed and help has arrived, it's not the primary immediate action to take during an ongoing assault.

Therefore, the most crucial and safest action is to leave the scene and call for professional help.
"
Na maloba mae malandi nini ekokani te na lolenge ya kotala position ya victime?,"The correct answer is **B: Tala nanu esika likama yambo ay victime (Look at where the victim is lying)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is *not* helpful in determining the victim's position.  The passage emphasizes the importance of observing the victim's body language and the position of the body in relation to the attacker.

* **A: Komitungisa te soki yomoko okoki kozoka (Don't try to move them if you don't have to)** - This is a crucial piece of advice for safety and preserving evidence. It *is* relevant.
* **C: Tala malamu position ya victime (Look at the victim's position)** - This is essential for understanding what happened. It *is* relevant.
* **D: Meka kotala malamu soki okomona elembo ya bokebisi (Try to look carefully if you see signs of injury)** -  Observing injuries can provide context, but the core focus is on the body position itself.  It *is* relevant.

The passage *doesn't* explicitly mention the importance of *where* the victim is lying. While the location is important contextually, the key is understanding the *position* of the body itself in relation to the attacker and the overall scene.  Therefore, focusing on the specific location the victim is lying isn't the most helpful aspect for determining their position *relative to the assault*.



"
Na kati ya BaMbongwana oyo botomboki ya ba Francais ememaki nini esalaki bokeseni makasi na bato oyo basalaka mosala?,"The correct answer is **B: Kolongola makanisi na kelasi pona kotala mingi makoki ya kosala mosala** (Undermining class distinctions to increase the ability to participate in political life).

Here's why:

The passage states that the French Revolution, while aiming for equality, paradoxically benefited those who were already wealthy and powerful. It mentions that the revolution created opportunities for those who were already at the top, allowing them to consolidate their power.  It also points out the rise of the bourgeoisie (middle class) who used the revolution to gain political power and dismantle class structures that had previously limited their advancement.

Option B directly reflects this: the revolution, despite its ideals of equality, *undermined class distinctions* allowing the bourgeoisie (and ultimately, those who held wealth) to increase their political power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Komatisa lisungi pona ekolo** (Creating a framework for the economy): While economic changes occurred during the revolution, the passage doesn't emphasize the creation of a new economic framework as the most significant aspect of its impact on political participation.
*   **C: Kolanda lolenge ya BaRepibliken kosala makambo** (Extending the principles of Republicanism): The passage acknowledges the spread of Republican ideals, but it focuses more on the uneven distribution of benefits and the consolidation of power by certain groups.
*   **D: Lolenge ya sika ya komeka makambo** (A simple way to express things): This is irrelevant to the content of the passage.



"
"Kolanda botomboki ya ba francais, elonga kati ya mapinga mpe na misala misusu ekokaki kozala penza te na pona nini?","The correct answer is **B: Classe (Class)**.

Here's why:

The provided text discusses the French Revolution and how it initially aimed for equality and a system based on the will of the people. However, it also mentions that with the revolution, opportunities opened up for those who were already powerful and wealthy.  The text further states that the revolution led to a shift where people used soda (presumably meaning leveraging the revolution for personal gain) to gain power and eliminate class structures. 

Therefore, the central issue hindering the full realization of the revolution's ideals is the persistence of **class distinctions**.  The revolution didn't completely eliminate the existing class system; it just altered the way people navigated it.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mosala oyo esalemi (This practice is pointless):**  While the revolution's outcome might be seen as having some pointless aspects, the core issue isn't that the revolution itself was pointless.
* **C: Esika esengeli kokoma (It is necessary to remain):** This doesn't relate to the obstacles faced after the revolution.
* **D: Lolenge ya kozala (The opportunity to be):** While the revolution created opportunities, those opportunities were not evenly distributed due to the existing class system.

Mosala nini ya leta oyo elobami kosala bato kozanga esengo na ba mboka oyo ekoba liboso?,"Let's break down the questions and answers.

**Question 1: Understanding the Transport Challenge**

The question describes a common issue: transporting a large number of people is complex and often faces delays. It asks *why* this happens, especially when considering the significant resources (like engineers) dedicated to transport.

The core of the problem lies in the fact that **there's always a limit to how quickly and efficiently you can move people.**  This is because:

* **Capacity Limits:**  Roads, trains, buses, etc., have maximum capacities. 
* **Traffic Congestion:**  A large number of people trying to use the same routes at the same time causes delays.
* **Infrastructure Limitations:**  Building new roads, expanding railways, etc., takes time and money.
* **Unexpected Events:** Accidents, weather, and other unforeseen circumstances can disrupt transport.
* **Coordination Challenges:**  Coordinating different modes of transport to make them work together smoothly is difficult.
* **Resource Constraints:** Even with engineers, there are budget, material, and labor constraints.

The question is asking *why* perfect, constant, and immediate transport isn't possible, *despite* engineering efforts. It's about inherent limitations.

**Question 2:  The Government's Role in Managing Crowded Areas**

The question asks about a government initiative to manage crowds in areas that are often crowded.

* **A: Lolenge ya mai (Water resources):** This refers to managing water supply and drainage, not crowd management.
* **B: Botongi ba gbagba (Waste management):** This refers to collecting and disposing of garbage, not crowd management.
* **C: Transport ya bato nyonso (Mass transportation):** This refers to providing buses, trains, etc., which can help move people *out* of crowded areas, but it's not directly about *managing* crowds in place.
* **D: Kelasi (Class):** This refers to social stratification and is not directly related to the problem.

The best answer is **C: Transport ya bato nyonso (Mass transportation)**.  Governments often invest in and manage mass transportation systems (buses, trains, metro systems) as a way to *relieve* congestion and make crowded areas more manageable.  They might also implement strategies related to public transport to encourage people to use it and reduce traffic.



**Therefore:**

* **Question 1 doesn't have a single ""correct"" answer but it's about understanding limitations of transport**
* **Question 2's best answer is C: Transport ya bato nyonso (Mass transportation)**



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kolobama na mae malandi transport pona bato nyonso?","The correct answer is **A: Elingami na bato nyonso oyo basalelaka yango (There are many people who use it)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bato nyonso bazalaki komilela mpona transport yango."" (Everyone uses it for transport.) This highlights the high demand and volume of people relying on the transport system.
* **The passage also implies:**  The system is often overwhelmed, leading to delays and congestion.  This suggests the number of users exceeds the capacity.
* **The other options are less directly supported by the text:**
    * **B: Ezali mabe penza te lokola mai (It's not that bad like that):** The text indicates it *is* bad, leading to delays and difficulty.
    * **C: Esalaka ete bato oyo basalelaka yango balobaloba mingi (It's because the people who use it are very thoughtful):**  This is not related to the congestion issue.
    * **D: Ezali ya ofele na ba mboka mingi oyo ekoba liboso (It's due to many roads that are always open):** While the number of roads can influence traffic, the passage focuses on the *number of people using the transport* as the primary driver of the problem.

Therefore, the answer that best reflects the passage's core argument is that the sheer volume of users is the main reason for the congestion.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi ekoki kozala makasi pona komeka kolanda bizaleli makasi ya bakumbi mituka.?","The best answer is **B: Kolengela banzela bisika mituka ezo tambola (Managing the roads where the vehicles travel)**. Here's why:

* **The passage states the problem is inefficient traffic flow due to predictable, often uniform, behavior of drivers.**  This suggests the problem lies in the *infrastructure* (the roads) and how it encourages that predictable behavior.
* **Option B directly addresses this.** Managing the road network – through things like traffic signals, road design, lane markings, and route planning – can significantly impact traffic flow and reduce congestion.
* **Why other options are less suitable:**
    * **A: Vitesi ya bokumbi (Vehicle speed):** While speed is a factor *within* the traffic flow, it's not the core *cause* of the problem described.  The problem is the predictability, not necessarily the speed itself.
    * **C: Lolenge Makambo ezali kosalema na nzela (How things are flowing in the road):** This is too general. The passage describes the *cause* of the flow being problematic, not just the fact that flow exists.
    * **D: Lolenge mituka ezotambola (How the vehicles travel):** While this is related, it doesn't encompass the *management* aspect.  You can't simply observe how vehicles travel; you need to *influence* and *control* that travel.



Therefore, managing the roads where vehicles travel is the most effective solution to improve traffic flow based on the passage's description of the problem.



"
Na mae malandi nini oyo esalemaka mingi na nzela ya mathematique pona kolakisa lolenge mituka etambolaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Lolenge nzela esalemi (Traffic flow theory)**.

Here's why:

* **The question explicitly asks about mathematical approaches to analyze traffic flow.** The passage discusses how traffic flow is affected by flow rate (débit), density, and speed. These are fundamental concepts *within* traffic flow theory.  The passage mentions that mathematical modeling, optimization, and simulation are used to understand and manage traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lolenge Makambo ezali kosalema na nzela (Theory of things are being processed/calculated on the road):** This is too general. While traffic flow involves processing information, it's not a specific theory.
* **B: Bizaleli ya mokumbi (Actions of individuals):** While individual driver behavior *affects* traffic flow, the question is asking about the underlying *theory* that mathematically models it. Individual actions are a factor, not the theory itself.
* **D: Bato boni bazali kosalela nzela (People see they are processing the road):** This is irrelevant. The question asks about mathematical models, not perception.



"
Hershey na Chase bamekaki nini pona kolona ADN nabango? ,"The correct answer is **A: Phosphore radioactive**.

Here's why:

*   **Hershey and Chase's experiment:** They used bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to determine whether DNA or protein was responsible for the genetic material.
*   **Radioactive labeling:** They labeled the DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the protein with radioactive sulfur.
*   **The experiment:** They allowed the phages to infect bacteria and then used a blender to separate the phage particles from the bacterial cells. They then measured the radioactivity in each compartment (phage and bacteria).
*   **The result:** They found that the radioactivity was primarily found *inside* the bacteria, indicating that DNA, labeled with phosphorus, had entered the cells.

Therefore, the key to Hershey and Chase's experiment was the use of **radioactive phosphorus** to track the DNA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ba gene oyo ebotaka (Genes that produce):** While genes are important for heredity, they weren't directly used in this specific experiment.
*   **C: Soufre ya radioactif (Radioactive sulfur):**  Sulfur was used to label the protein, but the experiment's conclusion relied on the phosphorus results.
*   **D: Bavirisi (Viruses):** Viruses (specifically bacteriophages) were the *vehicle* used in the experiment, but the key was the radioactive labeling of their components.



"
Makoki mpo mbongwana epesama na bana elandani na nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntina ya gene oyo ebotaka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mbogwana ekoki kosala na bopusi ekeseni na kotalela lolenge ya mbongwana esalemi, eteni ya gene oyo ebongwani mpe soki baselile oyo ebongwani eza baselile oyo ebotaka."" (A mutation in a gene can occur during a sperm or egg formation, and the change in that gene is the cause of the affected offspring.)
* **This directly links the gene's mutation to the inheritance of traits.**  The passage emphasizes that the *gene* is what's passed down and causes the offspring to have the same traits as the affected parent.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Soki baselile ebotaka:** (If the sperm/egg is affected) While being an affected sperm/egg is *necessary* for inheritance, it doesn't directly state that the *gene* itself is the reason.
* **C: Lolenge ya mbongwana:** (The cause of the mutation) This is related, but option B is more specific and accurate.  It's the *gene* that is altered.
* **D: Soki mbongwana ekoki kotinda selile ekufa:** (If the sperm can kill the egg) This is not mentioned in the text and is irrelevant to the question.



Therefore, the most accurate answer, based on the provided text, is **B**.



"
"Kolanda bansango ebele oyo epesami na maloba wana, bizaleli nini ebele oyo mbongwana etalelaka te?","The correct answer is **A: Ba gene ya kobota boni oyo ezui bokono (Genes that can repair damage)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mbogwana mosusu ekoki koboma baselile to kopesa maladi ya kansere"" (Cancer can be caused by mutations).
* **It further explains:** ""Mbogwana ekoki kosala na bopusi ekeseni na kotalela lolenge ya mbongwana esalemi"" (Cancer can sometimes repair damage to its own genes).  This implies there are mechanisms *preventing* cancer, and those mechanisms are related to gene repair.
* **The question asks:** ""Bizaleli nini ebele oyo mbongwana etalelaka te?"" (What is a lot that cancer doesn't do?) The passage points to the lack of effective gene repair as a key difference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Soki baselile oyo ezui bokono ebotaka (If the damaged cells are dividing):** While cell division *can* contribute to cancer, the passage isn't primarily focusing on cell division itself, but on the *repair* mechanisms.
* **C: Ntina ya ba gene oyo ezui bokono (The lack of genes that repair damage):** This is a bit too direct. The passage doesn't explicitly state the *lack* of repair genes, but rather the *failure* of repair mechanisms. Option A is more nuanced and accurate.
* **D: Lolenge ya mbongwana oyo ezali affecter (The way cancer's genes are affected):** The passage focuses more on the repair mechanisms (or lack thereof) than specifically on *how* the genes are affected.



Therefore, the best answer is **A**.



"
Na mae malandi nini oyo ezali te kati ya bantina pona nini bakoko ya kala babatelaki bantaba?,"The correct answer is **C: Basungaki na kobika elongo na bato (They tie them to the ground)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bazalaki kobokola mbala mingi bantaba ya mboka na bituluku oyo ezalaki kotambolatambola na bangomba to na bisika mosusu oyo ezalaki na matiti, mbala mingi babateli na bango ezalaki bana ya mike to bilenge, ndenge moko na babateli na mpate oyo bayebani mingi.""  This translates to: ""They often tie down animals to the ground, especially in areas where paths wind through the mountains or in other places in the foothills, often targeting young or weak animals, as those who hunt are more likely to succeed in that area.""

Option C, ""Basungaki na kobika elongo na bato,"" which means ""They tie them to the ground,"" directly reflects this description. The other options don't align with the information provided.



"
Litomba ya golf ezali kozua nini mukie?,"The correct answer is **D: Mabulu**.

The text states: ""Golfe eza lisano oyo basani basalelaka banzete mpona kokotisa babalon na mabulu."" which translates to ""Golf is a game where players use clubs to hit balls onto the greens."" 

Therefore, the clubs are called **mabulu** (clubs).
"
"Na terain golfe , matiti ekatemaka mukuse mingi na esika nini?","The correct answer is **A: Na libulu ya zomi na mwambe (Rough)**.

The text states: ""Joueur oyo abetaka banzete moko to oyo asalelaka diemba mingi, to mpona kosilisa pe kolonga. Lisano wana ebetamaka na matiti, pe matiti ya zingazinga ya libulu bakataka yango mpo ezala mokuse pe babengaka yango green.""

This translates to: ""A player who makes a single putt or who hits a long shot, to save or recover. This shot lands in the rough, and the rough grass makes it difficult to get it up and onto the green.""

Therefore, the ball lands in the rough, which is characterized by longer grass.
"
Litomba monene ya komekameka ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Pona kososola ndenge nini mokili ezali kotambola.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the scientific method is used to ""understand how the world works."" Option B directly reflects this purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pona kolongola likanisi moko to ebele ya biyano** (To find a single or multiple solutions): While finding solutions *can* be a result of the scientific method, it's not the core purpose. The method is about understanding, not just finding answers.
*   **C: Pona kotuna mituna** (To verify theories):  Verifying theories is a step *within* the scientific method, but the method itself is broader than just theory verification.
*   **D: Pona kosalisa bolukiluki ya siansi** (To standardize scientific research): Standardizing research is important for reproducibility, but it's not the fundamental aim of the scientific method. The method is about *doing* research to understand the world.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini esungaka te bolukiluki ya siansi?","The correct answer is **D: Kosala bolukiluki**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Komeka, mpe komeka eza eloko basalaka mpona kolongola likanisi moko to makanisi mingi, kotuna mituna, mpe kopesa makanisi esalisaka mpe na bolukiluki ya makambo ya siansi.""  This translates to: ""Experimentation and observation are the things that scientists do to investigate a single phenomenon or many phenomena, to collect data, and to interpret data are also based on scientific methods.""

Therefore, the core of scientific methodology is **conducting experiments (kosala bolukiluki)**.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Metode ya siansi yango moko to lolenge ya kosala** (The scientific method itself or the act of experimentation):  While experimentation is *part* of the scientific method, the method is broader than just experimentation.
* **B: Lolenge ya kosala botali** (The act of experimentation is not): This is incorrect; experimentation is a key element.
* **C: Kolongola makanisi ya biyano** (Collecting data on animals): This is a specific example of data collection, but not the overarching definition of the scientific method.

Therefore, **kosala bolukiluki (conducting experiments)** best captures what is fundamental to the scientific method as described in the text.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini na mae matali mpela ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **A: Mpela ekoki kobebisa biloko nyonso liboso na yango (Pellets can do everything constantly with it)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mpela ekoki koboma biloko nyonso na nzela ntango ezoleka"" which translates to ""Pellets can do everything with the means that are available"". This implies that pellets are versatile and can perform a wide range of actions, not just a single specific one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mpela ebetaka bisika mikie mikie kokokanisa te na mipepe misusu (Pellets don't always have to collide with strong winds)** - The text explicitly says the pellets *do* interact with strong winds.
*   **C: Ebele ya ba mpela ewumelaka koleka bangonga misato (Many pellets can fly up to 3 times as high)** - While the text mentions some pellets can fly high, it doesn't say that's common for *many* pellets.  It focuses on the extreme speed of the wind, not the altitude of the pellets.
*   **D: Ba mpela misusu ekoki kozala na mipepe pene ya 300 kilometres par heuere (Some pellets can be in winds of over 300 kilometers per hour)** - The text confirms that winds *can* reach 300 km/h, but it doesn't say *some* pellets *are* in those winds. It's about the potential of the wind, not the pellets' position within it.

"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini kati ya mae malandi esosolisi malamu ba mpela ebele?","The correct answer is **A: Ewumelaka mingimingi koleka bangonga misato** (It can withstand much stronger winds than normal winds).

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Mpela mibale ya koleka makasi na kati ya mokanda esalaka bangonga koleka misato"" which translates to ""The strongest winds in the center of a hurricane can reach speeds of three times stronger.""
* The question asks what the winds are capable of *despite* being strong. The text highlights the hurricane's ability to withstand high winds.
* Option B is partially true (it *can* reach 480 km/h), but the question is about the hurricane's ability to handle strong winds, not just their speed.
* Options C and D are not directly mentioned or supported by the text.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that hurricanes are capable of withstanding winds much stronger than normal winds."
Kati na mae malandi bato ba bandaki kosala nini na ekeke ya 16?,"The correct answer is **A: Kosalela maneti**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Bato basalaka pe basalelaka maneti mpona kokoma kitoko banda bambula mingi mpenza."" This translates to ""People used to observe the stars in order to discover things that would increase knowledge greatly.""
* The text then goes on to say: ""Kasi, telescope ya liboso ya solo esalemaki na Eropa na suka ya ekeke ya 16."" This translates to ""However, the first telescope was invented in Europe in the 16th century.""
*  The sentence following that is: ""Batelescope oyo esalelaki maneti mibale mpo kosala ete biloko oyo eza mosika emonana pembeni mpe eza minene."" This translates to ""These telescopes were used to observe stars to make distant objects appear closer and smaller.""

Therefore, the main activity people engaged in during the 16th century, related to the passage, was **observing the stars (kosalela maneti)** using the newly invented telescopes.

While the other options are related to what telescopes *do*, the question asks what people *did* with telescopes in the 16th century.
"
Pona ngonga boni bato basili kokokomisa biloko mineneminene na nzela ya maneti?,"The correct answer is **C: Pona bambula nkoto** (To build a telescope).

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* people started building telescopes.** The text says that early telescopes were made in Europe in the 16th century to help people see distant objects. This indicates the *purpose* was to observe things further away, essentially to see more detail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobanda bikeke 16 eleki (Because 16th-century glasses were made):** While telescopes were made in the 16th century, the *reason* for building them wasn't just the availability of those glasses. The glasses were a *tool* used to achieve the goal of observing more distant objects.
* **B: Banda ebandeli ya ekeke ya 16 (Because of the invention of the 16th-century glass):**  Similar to A, the glass was the instrument, not the primary reason for creating telescopes.
* **D: Banda ebandeli ya ekeke ya 16 (Because of the invention of the 16th-century glass):** Same reasoning as B.

Therefore, the core reason for building telescopes was to *observe more distant objects* - essentially to gain a wider view and see things in more detail. Option C, ""Pona bambula nkoto"" (To build a telescope), is the best fit as it encapsulates the fundamental driving force behind their creation.

"Kolanda maloba wana, libulu ya Muhammad elobi nini na mae matali mimesano naye ya kimolimo to bizaleli ya malamu?","The correct answer is **C: Azalaki na mposa ya kozala yemoko pona ngonga mukuse (He was in a state of solitude for intense communion with God).**

Here's why:

The passage describes the cave as a place of intense isolation, hidden and inaccessible. Muhammad sought solitude there to have a direct, personal connection with God. The phrase ""pona komaniola"" (for communion) is key, and the description of the cave's remoteness emphasizes the need for complete isolation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abatelaka makasi kimia mpe kozala yemoko (He was very chemically altered and alone):** The passage doesn't mention any chemical alterations. It focuses on spiritual solitude.
*   **B: Makelele ya libanda ekoki kosunga komaniola (The remoteness of the place could contain communion):** While the remoteness facilitates communion, the passage highlights that it wasn't simply the *remoteness* but the *intense solitude* that was essential.
*   **D: Akokaki kozela te bato bamona mpe koyoka ye (He could not be seen by people and pray):**  The passage states he *did* pray there, but only in solitude, hidden from others.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, libende ebandaki kosalema yambo mpona bosenga nini?","The correct answer is **A: Bisika ya kokatisa (Seals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Babakisaki bisika ya kokatisa malamu na ebandeli po banzela ebeba te."" which translates to ""They tried to seal the gaps in the boilers so that the steam wouldn't escape.""

The passage goes on to describe how steam escaping made the wheels of the wagons wear out.  Therefore, sealing the gaps (bisika ya kokatisa) was the solution to reduce steam loss and prevent wear.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, pona nini nzela ya engbunduka ya mabaya embongwanaki pona kotiya nzela ya engbunduka ya mabende?","The correct answer is **D: Ezalaki kobebisama na libende ya nzela (It was able to absorb the wear and tear of the metal).**

Here's why:

The text states that the problem with iron wheels was that they wore down quickly, causing the wagons to become heavy.  They tried adding layers of iron to the wheels to make them more durable.  The key phrase is ""ebende ebebisaka lisusu mingi bapneu ya mabaya ya ba wagons"" which translates to ""the wood wore down the bad tires of the wagons a lot.""  This indicates that wood (and eventually, iron combined with wood) was better at absorbing the wear and tear compared to solid iron.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ematisaki vitesi ya punda (It increased the speed of the wheels):** The text doesn't mention speed.  The focus is on durability.
*   **B: Emonanaki kozala makasi mpe malamu mingi (It could be made lighter and stronger):** While wood can be relatively lightweight, the text doesn't highlight this as a primary reason for switching. The durability aspect is more emphasized.
*   **C: Ezalaki na makasi ya komema mikumba ya kilo (It was able to save weight):** The text says iron wheels *increased* weight. The goal was to reduce the wear and tear, not necessarily to save weight.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na tango ya BaRoma nini emonisaki bato lolenge ya kozala?","The correct answer is **C: Kibokoko**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""kibokoko"" (spirit/atmosphere) of Rome, along with its history and the thinkers it produced, resonated with those who came after. The question asks what Rome showed people the value of.  The passage directly links the spirit/atmosphere of Rome to a valuable quality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mibeko (Customs/Traditions):** While Rome had customs, the passage focuses more on the *spirit* and intellectual impact rather than specific customs.
* **B: Geografie (Geography):** Geography influenced Rome, but the passage doesn't highlight it as the core reason for its value.
* **D: Milende (Millennia):** The passage mentions a long history, but it's the *spirit* of that history that's emphasized, not the sheer duration of time.



"
Na mae malandi nini elobi malamu te makanisi munene ya mayele ya determinisme ? ,"The correct answer is **A: Makambo tekonolozi esalaka na lisanga ya bato bango moko bapesaka ndingisa (Things that technology does happen through the organization of people who give it direction).**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ete kosala tekonolozi yango moke elandaka malako oyo elandaka te bopusi ya bizaleli to ya politiki, pe ete tekonolozi yango moko eza na """"bopusi"""" na masanga oyo eza yango moko kasi te oyo esanganaka na basusu."" (and that practicing technology on its own does not create effects in the realm of values or politics, and that technology on its own is ""neutral"" in a context that is only for itself, but not one that is connected to others.)

This means technology itself is neutral. It's *how* people organize and use technology that gives it direction and impact. Therefore, the ""malamu te makanisi munene ya mayele ya determinisme"" (the misconception of the large force of determinism) is that technology operates independently of human will and direction.


Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bokobi malamu ya tekonolozi esalemaki te kouta na molende (The neutral nature of technology cannot be used to undermine the state).** The text *does* discuss the implications of technology on politics.
* **C: Tekonolozi ezali na ba effets naturel epai na bato (Technology has natural effects on people).** While technology *does* have effects, the text argues those effects aren't inherent to the technology itself, but rather arise from how it's implemented by humans.
* **D: Bokobi malamu ya tekonolozi esalemi te na makambo ya politike (The neutral nature of technology is not related to political matters).** The text clearly states technology *is* related to political matters, highlighting how it's used within political contexts.



"
"Kolanda moloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini oyo elandani te na bobendi bow?","The correct answer is **D: Kobanda ligorodo (drawing a circle)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Likolo elimboli osengeli kobanda na likolo pe kobeta litimbo na se, pe na se elimboli osengeli kobanda ligorodo (oyo eza esika oyo liboko na yo esimbi litimbo) mpe kobenda litimbo.""  This translates to: ""The pencil should move to the pencil and release the point, and then it should draw a circle (which is where the point of your drawing is) and release the point.""

The text says that drawing a circle is *not* the way to make a ""down bow mark.""  Options A, B, and C all describe ways *to* make a ""down bow mark"" according to the text.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini ekokani na mongongo ya malamu mingi?","The correct answer is **A: Elembo ya down bow**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the difference between the ""up bow"" and the ""down bow."" It states that the ""down bow"" is not a suitable method for creating a clear sound, while the ""up bow"" is. The text then describes the proper technique for the ""up bow"" (moving the bow across the strings).

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kobenda bow:** This is too general. The text focuses on *how* to move the bow, not just the act of moving it.
* **C: Elembo oyo ezali komonana lokola V:** While the text mentions the ""up bow"" resembles a ""V,"" this is just a visual description and not the core issue being discussed. The problem is the *technique* of the bow, not its shape.
* **D: Kobanda esika oyo loboko nayo ezali kosimba bow:** This describes a general placement and isn't specific to the technique being discussed or the error being warned against.



"
Mikwa ya kala emonisi maboko ekomaki kosalema mpona motindi nini kati ya mae malandi?,"The correct answer is **C: Lokomotion**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that early hominids had ""bushy arms"" and that their hands were adapted for locomotion (walking). 
* The phrase ""mokuse koleka lokolo"" (more like the ground) refers to bipedalism, which is a form of locomotion.
* While the passage mentions other possibilities like climbing and carrying, the primary adaptation highlighted is for movement on the ground.

Therefore, the early hominid hand structure is best understood as an adaptation for **locomotion**.
"
Na mae malandi nini elobeli malamu baphalanges ya mokomboso ? ,"The correct answer is **B: Maboko mpe makolo nabango ekeseni na kimolai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loboko ya moto eza mokuse koleka lokolo, ezalaka na phalanges ya semba."" This directly translates to ""The hand of humans is more curved than that of primates, it is on the phalanges of the fingers."" 

Option B accurately reflects this. The curvature and the phalanges of the fingers are key features differentiating human hands from those of primates, and they are linked to the ability to grip and manipulate objects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ezali semba koleka maboko ya moto** (It is more curved than the hand of a human) - This is incorrect because the passage states *the opposite*. Human hands are *more curved* than primate hands.
*   **C: Esalemaka pona komema mikumba** (It is for grasping prey) - While grasping is important, the passage doesn't directly connect the phalanges to hunting. It emphasizes the curvature and the finger bones themselves.
*   **D: Ezalaka yambo pona kosalela** (It is useful for building) - Similar to C, building isn't the primary focus of the passage. The passage emphasizes the structural differences of the hand itself.



"
Boponami elongolaka variation genetique na pole nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Kokabola**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Kokabola mpe kosangisa lisusu ekendaka liboso pe ezongaka nsima na basonge mibele mbala na mbala"" which translates to ""Recombination and reshuffling occur frequently and arise between the chromosomes of the parents.""  Recombination (or crossing over) is the process where genetic material is exchanged between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. This exchange creates new combinations of genes, leading to genetic variation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ya kobombana (By mating):** While mating is necessary for inheritance, it's the *recombination* during meiosis that *creates* the variation.
*   **B: Baoyo eyebana (Because they are related):** Relatedness doesn't directly cause genetic variation.  It allows for shared genes, but recombination is what rearranges them.
*   **D: Ya komonana (By similarity):** Similarity doesn't cause variation. Variation arises from differences and reshuffling.



"
Eteni nini esali ete kobongwana genetique ebakisama?,"The correct answer is **C: Mbongwana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbongwana ebakisa lolenge ya sika ya bagene, mpe kosangisa elongoli yango na molongo ya baoyo esi eyebana.""

Translation: ""The womb gives the essence of the child, and connects its destiny to the destiny of its parents, based on how they are related.""

This clearly indicates that the **womb (mbongwana)** is the element that facilitates the genetic connection and links the child's fate to its parents.
"
"Kolanda bansango na maloba wana, na mae malandi nini oyo esengeli nyama primate aliya pona kosilisa “likambo ya vitamine?”","The correct answer is **B: Bandunda ya mobesu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbala mosusu bilei ya zamba oyo bato bakoki kozwa kozanga mpasi eza baproteine oyo tokoki kozwa na matiti mpe bandunda, kasi yango ezalaka mpasi mingi mpona baprimate lokola biso mpo tolambaka yango liboso ya kolia yango.""  This translates to: ""Often, the most significant thing found in the diet is protein that can be found in milk and nuts, but it is much more significant for primates like us to be able to digest it fully.""

It then goes on to say: ""...soki totaleli makambo nyonso, tokoki kokamwa te soki bakoko na biso babongisaki """"makambo na bango ya vitamine"""" ndenge makaku esalaka yango sikoyo na esobe."" This indicates that nuts and seeds are crucial for obtaining ""vitamine"" (referring to nutrients).

Therefore, the passage emphasizes that **nuts and seeds (bandunda ya mobesu)** are the key source of essential nutrients for primates, including those needed for ""vitamine"" function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Matiti ya kokauka (Cow's milk):** The passage mentions milk and nuts, but it highlights nuts as *more* significant for primates.
*   **C: Banyama mikiemikie oyo baliaka matiti (Mammalian animals that produce milk):** This is too broad. The passage focuses on the particular dietary need for primates.
*   **D: Nzete ya fololo (Fulvous seed):** The passage doesn't mention ""fulvous seed"" at all.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya makambo oyo elandi likambo nini esalemaka te pona kozanga aside amino ya ntina?","The correct answer is **C: Mikakatano pona kokola (Lack of proper digestion)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""kozanga kosala yango ememaka mikakatano minene: koniokwama makasi na makanisi, kolia malamu te mpe **sukasuka liwa**.""  This translates to: ""it requires a lot of digestion: a lot of work for the stomach, not eating soft food and **digestion is difficult**.""  The passage also emphasizes that the digestive system of primates, unlike some other animals, is designed to *break down* these proteins efficiently.  Therefore, a lack of proper digestion is the main obstacle.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Mikakatano ya libumu (Lack of proper stomach acid)** - While stomach acid is important for protein digestion, the passage doesn't highlight a lack of stomach acid as the primary problem. The problem is the complexity of the digestion process itself.
*   **B: Koliya mabe (Eating poorly)** -  The passage states that *not* eating soft food is a factor, but the core problem isn't simply poor eating habits.  It's the *difficulty* in breaking down the protein even when consumed.
*   **D: Liwa (Difficulty)** - While 'liwa' (difficulty) is mentioned, it describes the *overall process* rather than the *specific reason* why protein digestion is difficult. ""Mikakatano pona kokola"" (lack of proper digestion) provides the specific reason.

Lolenge nini bakitani ya molende mbala na mbala bamonisaka kozala nabango kati ya likita?,"The correct answer is **B: Na nzela ya kolanda bondimeli ya moto nyonso nzinganzinga** (By appealing to the universal desire for belonging).

Here's why:

The first paragraph states that the desire to belong to a group is a fundamental human need. The question asks why people who are being manipulated often turn to them. Option B directly addresses this by saying manipulation works by appealing to the desire to belong – a very powerful and common human motivation.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Na nzela ya komeka komiyoka nsomi na kati** (By appealing to the need for inner peace/harmony): While this might be a secondary effect, it's not the primary *reason* people turn to manipulators.
* **C: Na nzela ya kondima mibeko ya likita** (By inciting/provoking the rules of society): This is incorrect. Manipulation doesn't usually involve breaking societal rules; it often works *within* the existing social structure.
* **D: Na nzela ya kosalela ndenge ya kobika lokola elembo** (By presenting a way to be seen as an icon): This is a possible tactic *used by some* manipulators, but it's not the overarching reason why people *turn* to them.

"Kolanda lisolo oyo epesami na maloba wana, nini ekoki kokomela mwana oyo azali konyokwama na likama ya rasisme oyo azali komonana na bizaleli ya matata.","The best answer is **B: Mwana akoki kobanda kozala na bizaleli ya matata**.

Here's why:

* **The question describes a situation where children learn about prejudice and discrimination.** The text states that children who are taught about racism become less likely to exhibit prejudiced behavior. This implies that the initial state *is* prejudice, but it's not a fixed state.
* **Option B acknowledges that children *can* overcome prejudice.** This aligns with the positive outcome described in the prompt.
* **Option A (""Mwana akomeka koboya kozala na bizaleli ya matata"" - The child is becoming prejudiced)** is too definitive and doesn't reflect the possibility of change highlighted in the text.
* **Option C (""Mwana akomibenda na makambo oyo etali bato misusu"" - The child is becoming involved with other people)** is too general and not directly related to the issue of prejudice. While interaction is important, the question focuses on overcoming prejudice.
* **Option D (""Mwana akoboya kosangana na bato ya bikolo misusu ya mikiemikie"" - The child will try to associate with more people of different races)** is a possible strategy to combat prejudice, but it's not the core outcome the question is asking about.  The question is about the child's internal state.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and appropriate response based on the provided text."
"Kolanda na maloba wana, mwana oyo azali na boyebi ya makambo ya rasisme akoki kozala na bizaleli nini kati ya mae malandi?","The correct answer is **A: Ekolo to mposo ya nzoto ya mukie oyo aponi lokola yaye (Racist or prejudiced)**.

Here's why:

The initial statement describes how children who understand racial differences and see them as significant are more likely to exhibit prejudiced behavior.  The question asks what a child with this understanding *might* do.  

Option A directly links the understanding of racial differences with prejudiced behavior.  It states the child *could* be racist or prejudiced.  This is a direct consequence of the premise.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Bizaleli naye (Them/their behavior):** This is too vague. While prejudice *influences* behavior, it doesn't directly *equal* behavior. It's a cause, not the action itself.
*   **C: Lolenge na ya kobika na bana misusu (A solution of having more children):** This is completely irrelevant to the topic of racial understanding and prejudice.
*   **D: Lolenge naye ya kolimbola mposo ya nzoto (Their solution to fight racism):**  While understanding racial differences *can* lead to anti-racist action, the question asks about potential negative outcomes *because* of that understanding.  The initial premise focuses on how this understanding can contribute to prejudice, not necessarily towards fighting it.



Therefore, the best answer reflects the direct link between understanding racial differences and the *potential* for prejudice."
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ekoki te komonana bokolisi ya mwana “feral” to mwana ya zamba?","The correct answer is **C: Bizaleli ya kolinga kozala mosika na bato** (A tendency to find comfort in the company of animals).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Mbala mosusu bana ya zamba baniokolaki bango makasi to bazalaki na mitungisi liboso babwakisa bango to bakima. Emonani ete misusu babokolaki bango na banyama; balobi ete misusu bazalaka kofanda na zamba bango moko. Soki bakokoli mwana na banyama oyo eza te bato, mwana wana azalaka na bizaleli (na makambo ya nzoto) oyo ekokani na oyo ya banyama oyo babaelaki ye, na ndakisa kobanga bato to kosepela na bango te.""

This translates to: ""Often, feral children find great comfort in them or constantly seek them out. It is seen that many of them find comfort in animals; they say that they like to be with animals alone. If a child is taken to animals that are not human, the child will have a (animalistic) tendency that is connected to that of the animals they are with, and will be inclined to distrust people or avoid them.""

The text directly links the tendency to be comforted by animals to a distrust of people and a development of animalistic traits.  This demonstrates that a preference for animals is a key characteristic that distinguishes a ""feral"" child or a ""zamba"" child.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobika yemoko (Solitude):** While solitude might be present, it's not the defining characteristic.  Many children enjoy solitude. The focus is on *what* they seek comfort in, not just *being* alone.
* **B: Lolenge makasi ya kosolola (Great need for affection):** The text highlights a *distrust* of people, not a need for affection.  Feral children are wary of human connection.
* **D: Kozanga koyeba kobika na lisanga ya bato (A tendency to fit in with human groups):**  The text clearly states the opposite – feral children distrust and avoid human groups.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: Bizaleli ya kolinga kozala mosika na bato**.

"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini elimboli malamu bizaleli ya zamba na bana ?","The correct answer is **A: Ebele ya bizaleli ya zamba na bana etindamaka na likama songolo na nzoto.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Soki bakokoli mwana na banyama oyo eza te bato, mwana wana azalaka na bizaleli (na makambo ya nzoto) oyo ekokani na oyo ya banyama oyo babaelaki ye, na ndakisa kobanga bato to kosepela na bango te.""  (If a child is raised with animals that are not human, the child will have (animalistic) traits that are connected to those of the animals they are raised with, and will have difficulty relating to people or separating from them.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bizaleli ya zamba ekoki kouta na kozanga kobika na bato** - While the passage mentions people raising ""zamba"" children, it focuses on the impact of animalistic upbringing, not necessarily the influence of human caregivers on the child's development.
* **C: Bizaleli ya zamba na bana ezalaka mingi kaka na baoyo baboti bakangaki bango** -  The passage states that the impact is *not* limited to just those who raise the child; it specifically relates to the influence of animals if the child is raised with them.
* **D: Bizaleli nyonso ya zamba etindamaka mikakatano ya mayele** - While animalistic traits are mentioned, the passage emphasizes the *difficulty relating to people* as a core component of the ""bizaleli"" (traits/problems) associated with raising a child with animals. It's not just about being inherently ""animalistic.""

"Kolanda maloba wana, na mimesano oyo elandi ya wapi ekokani te na boloni oyo babengaka « agriculture de subsistance » ?","The correct answer is **C: Kotalela kolona ebele na esika ya kotalela ba metodes ya makasi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that subsistence farmers *do* implement techniques to improve crop yields by selecting seeds, using fertilizers, and practicing crop rotation. The question asks what *doesn't* align with subsistence farming.

*   **A: Kotalela mingi kolona oyo ekokokisa bosenga ya moloni na libota naye (Focusing heavily on the science of soil and the sun):** While some subsistence farmers might understand soil and sun, it doesn't necessarily mean they invest heavily in scientific research or advanced soil science techniques.
*   **B: Kolona bilei pona kotekela basusu (Farming more for profit):**  Subsistence farming is about survival, not profit.
*   **C: Kotalela kolona ebele na esika ya kotalela ba metodes ya makasi (Focusing on a wide range of techniques to find advanced methods):** Subsistence farmers typically rely on traditional, locally-developed methods. They aren't actively seeking out and implementing advanced agricultural technologies or scientific advancements. They may experiment, but their focus is on practical, proven approaches.
*   **D: Koluka bambuma oyo ezali ya esika moloni abikaka (Ignoring the knowledge of older generations):**  Subsistence farmers often *do* rely on the knowledge passed down through generations.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is C because it describes an activity that is not characteristic of the traditional subsistence farming practices described in the passage.



"
Na mae malandi nini elimboli malamau bizaleli ya agriculture de subsistance ?,"The correct answer is **A: Bibongiseli na yango ezalaka ya biologie (Biological factors are involved)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Kolona biloko oyo babengaka agriculture de subsistance ezali kosala biloko mpona kobimisa bilei oyo ekokokisa bamposa ya mosali bilanga mpe ya libota na ye. Kolona biloko oyo babengaka agriculture de subsistance ezalaka pete, mbala mingi bibongiseli ya biologie esalelaka milona oyo babomba mpe basangisi yango na biloko euta na bamboka mosusu..."" 

This means that biological factors are key to increasing yields in subsistence agriculture.  The other options are less directly supported by the text:

* **B: Esalelaka technique ya bokeseni po milona ezala mingi (It involves a technique of cultivation to increase yields):** While techniques are used, the text emphasizes biological factors more.
* **C: Esungaka baloni kopesa miloni na bango na etuka na bango (It requires farmers to invest their labor in them):**  Labor investment is implied, but not the central point.
* **D: Ezali kokoba kosalema na baloni na bamboka misusu (It is a process of rotating crops with different varieties):** Crop rotation is a technique, and not the core biological factor discussed.



"
Kokende na musee ekoki kozala na lolenge nini ya tourisme?,"The correct answer is **C: Tourisme ya koyeba bokoko (Tourism of discovery/knowledge)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes museums as places where people go to learn and understand things, often history, art, or culture. This aligns directly with the idea of ""tourism of discovery"" or ""tourism of knowledge"" – traveling to learn something new.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Tourisme ya mombongo (Medical tourism):** This refers to traveling for medical treatments. Museums don't fit this description.
* **B: Tourisme ya kopema (Shopping tourism):** This refers to traveling primarily to shop. While some museums might have gift shops, the main purpose isn't shopping.
* **D: Tourisme ya libanda (Beach tourism):** This refers to traveling to beaches. Museums are generally indoors and not related to beaches.

"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kozala ya litomba pona basali mobembo ya tourisme ya recreation?","The correct answer is **D: Kososola istware ya Esika (Tell the story of the place)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what can be done to promote recreational tourism. The passage emphasizes that people travel for relaxation, escape, and to connect with nature or find peace.  A powerful way to draw people is to give a narrative and history to the place, making it more engaging and memorable. This aligns with option D, which directly addresses telling the story of the location.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Komizindisa mobimba na bango na kibokoko ya esika (Promote them very strongly in the atmosphere of the place):** While atmosphere is important, strong promotion alone isn't enough. It lacks substance and a reason to visit.
* **B: Kozua bopemi na misala na bango ya mikolo nyonso (Create a connection with their daily routines):**  Recreational tourism is often about escaping daily routines, not integrating with them.
* **C: Komona bamboka na bisika ya malonga (See the beauty of romantic places):** Romantic places are only *one* type of recreational destination. The passage describes a broader appeal of relaxation and escape.



Therefore, option D is the most logically sound answer based on the provided passage.

Nini epatemi na kati ya maloba wana lokola eloko oyo esungaki pona kokitisa kobanga mbongwana na kati ya lingomba ya esika?,"The correct answer is **A: Kokanisa ba ngonga ya malamu ya kimombongo (Understanding the complex roots of the trauma)**.

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes that trauma isn't just about the event itself, but the complex, often deeply rooted, factors that contribute to it.  It highlights how understanding the origins and the underlying dynamics of the trauma is crucial for healing.  The passage says ""Ata koyeba lisolo ya bomoi ya moto elakisi te koyeba mimeseno na ye, esalisaka na koyeba ata mpona koyeba esika moto yango azali na lisolo ya lisanga wana."" (Even knowing a person's life story doesn't help understand their trauma, it requires understanding even where they are in that traumatic experience).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kolinga kososola bato oyo basalaki malamu na molende ya lisanga (Focusing on supporting people who are suffering from the trauma)** While support is important, the passage isn't primarily about *supporting* victims, but about *understanding* the trauma itself.
* **C: Kososola ba ntina ya Lisanga (Focusing on the components of the trauma)**  ""Ba ntina ya Lisanga"" is not a standard term used in trauma studies. It's too vague.  The passage is more about the complex interconnectedness of the traumatic experience.
* **D: Koyeba istware ya y a lisanga (Knowing the history of the trauma)**  While understanding historical context can be helpful, the passage emphasizes the *personal and complex roots* of the trauma, not just its historical context.



"
"Kolanda na maloba wana, kozua bososoli ya lisaponge nayo ekosunga moto na nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kokitisa kobanga ya mbongwana** (Promoting the spirit of unity).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that understanding others, empathy, and kindness (the ""solos ya kolonga"" - the soliloquies of kindness) foster unity and connection.  The final paragraph states that these acts of kindness create a ""mbongwana ya sika mpe nzela ya sika na lingomba ya mboka"" - a spirit of unity and a path of unity for the future. 

Therefore, the soap's ability to ""kosunga moto na nini?"" (protect/sustain someone with what?) is to strengthen the spirit of unity that comes from practicing kindness and understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kolendisa bizaleli ya malamu** (Extending benevolent actions): While benevolent actions *lead* to unity, the passage focuses on the *result* of those actions – the strengthened spirit of unity.
* **C: Kozua esika ya kobika na kati ya lisanga** (Creating a place to stay in the middle of the community):  The passage doesn't directly talk about a physical ""place to stay."" It's more about emotional connection.
* **D: Kokolisa bizaleli ya kimombongo** (Magnifying spiritual actions): The passage doesn't talk about magnifying spiritual actions; it emphasizes the *impact* of kindness, which can be considered a spiritual action in this context.



"
Na maloba mae malandi ya wapi elimboli malamu mayele ya koyekola oyo ebengami postmoderne?,"The correct answer is **C: Balolenge misusu ya koyekola ezali malamu koleka misusu (Postmodern theories of interpretation are more subjective)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the subjectivity of interpretation.** It states that interpretation is a ""dialogue between the mind and the understanding that is given to it.""  It highlights that our own experiences and cultural contexts heavily influence how we interpret things.
* **Option C directly reflects this idea.** It says that postmodern interpretations are more subjective, which is precisely what the passage argues.
* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:**  While postmodernism does challenge fixed meanings, the passage doesn't explicitly say that interpretation is about ""less"" research. It's about a different *kind* of research, more focused on the individual's perspective.
    * **B:** This statement is the opposite of what the passage claims. Postmodernism *does* suggest that we can't fully grasp the intentions of the creator.
    * **D:** The passage argues that ""immense wealth"" (mobimba) *does* play a role in interpretation, as our experiences shape our understanding.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of the passage's central point about the subjective nature of postmodern interpretation.



"
Maloba nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu te mayele ya koyekola oyo ebengami post modern learning approach ?,"The correct answer is **C: Lolenge ya koyekola etalaka mingi moyekoli mpe malakisi oyo ezali kopesama.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Koyekola esalemaka na boyokani kati na moyekoli mpe boyebi oyo bazopesa ye."" (Learning happens through a connection between knowledge and understanding that is given to it). This highlights that postmodern learning emphasizes the interplay between what's taught (knowledge) and how it's interpreted (understanding).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lolenge ya koyekola bansango ezali ebele** (The possibilities of learning are numerous): While true, this isn't the *main* point the passage makes about the *nature* of postmodern learning. It describes *how* learning happens.
* **B: Balolenge misusu ya koyekola esengeli kosalema mingi mingi koleka misusu** (More diverse learning possibilities should be implemented): The passage doesn't advocate for more possibilities; it describes a specific approach.
* **D: Malakisi oyo tokoki te kosalela yango mokolo moko ezali na litomba koyekola** (Activities that we can't do even once are definitely learning): This is too extreme. Postmodern learning acknowledges a wide range of activities but doesn't equate the *inability* to do something as automatically being learning.



**In essence, the passage emphasizes that postmodern learning isn't about passively receiving information; it's about actively connecting it with your own knowledge and interpretation, thereby creating personal meaning.**  Option C best reflects this core principle.

"Sima ya kolamuka yomoko na ngonga ya pongi, nini na mae malandi ekoki kosala eloko somgolo pakala na eteni ya bokati pongi?","The correct answer is **A: Kotanga pona ngonga moko na ndambu liboso ya kozonga na pongi**

Here's why:

The text describes how the body's natural rhythms (biorythme) are disrupted by waking up in the middle of the night. The body's natural inclination is to stay asleep and continue its sleep cycle.  Therefore, waking up in the middle of the night can lead to feeling tired and less rested, making it difficult to function well during the day. Option A directly reflects this:  being forced to wake up in the middle of the night disrupts the natural sleep cycle and can make it harder to regain restful sleep later.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Kokende na toilete mpe kozonga na mbeto mbala moko:** While going to the bathroom is a natural bodily function, it doesn't explain the overall feeling of being tired and less rested after waking up in the middle of the night.
* **C: Koboma alarme nayo mpe kolala sima ya ngonga tukumibale:**  This simply delays the problem, it doesn't address the disruption to the natural sleep cycle.
* **D: Kolamuka komela mai na molangi pembeni ya mbeto nayo:** This might help you wake up more gently, but it doesn't address the fundamental issue of being woken up in the middle of your sleep cycle.



"
Nini na mae malandi ekokani te na bolimboli ya kokata pongi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekoki kolandana na biorhythme (It can be related to biorhythms)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Maponi mosusu oyo euti na biorythme esengaka komela mai mingi (mingimingi mai to the, po yango nde esalisaka) liboso ya kolala, yango esengaka kotelema mpona kokende kosuba."" This translates to ""Many other factors related to biorhythms tend to increase greatly (more or less, because it is the one that is responsible) before sleep, and it is necessary to wake up to continue sleeping.""

Therefore, the text connects the difficulty waking up with fluctuations in biorhythms. The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Litomba ezali ya komilamusa yomoko mobimba (It is a problem of waking up very easily):** The text suggests the opposite - difficulty waking up.
*   **C: Esalemaka na ngonga nayo ya kolala mikolo nyonso (It is related to our daily sleep cycle):** While related to sleep, the text specifically links it to *biorhythms* and difficulty waking.
*   **D: Sima ya kolamuka litomba ezali ya kolala lisusu sima ya bangonga mibale to deux heures du temps (The time of waking up is necessary to sleep another two hours):** The text indicates that waking up *prematurely* can disrupt the sleep cycle.



"
"Na tango boongo ezali komeka kozua ba ndoto ya malamu mingi mingi, nini ebakisamaka?","The correct answer is **A: Ba REM**.

Here's why:

The provided text explains that vivid dreams happen most often during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. It directly links the increased brain activity and the state of REM sleep to the intensity and frequency of dreams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nivo ya makasi (High level):** While high levels of something *might* be associated with dreams, the text specifically points to REM sleep.
* **C: Bowumeli pona kolamuka (Sleep deprivation):**  Sleep deprivation can affect dreams, but the text doesn't primarily focus on that. It's about the *state* of REM sleep.
* **D: Ngonga ya lolenge ya REM (Power of REM sleep):** While REM sleep is powerful, the text specifies *what* makes dreams vivid – the REM state itself.



"
Kozala na ba ndoto ya malamu ebele ekoki kosala nini na nzoto?,"The correct answer is **A: Kokitisa ngonga kati ya ba REM**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Ntina monene oyo likambo wana esalemaka ezali bandolo ya solo oyo ebakisaka molai ya ngonga kati na REM."" This translates to ""The reason this happens is due to a surge of blood flow in the brain during REM.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kokitisa ba REM butu moko na moko** - The text doesn't mention REM cycles lengthening.
*   **C: Kotalela mingi bandoto ya malamu** - While the text talks about frequent dreams, it doesn't state that *watching* a lot of dreams is the cause.  It points to the REM cycle.
*   **D: Komatisa ba REM butu moko moko** - The text states a surge (kokitisa) of blood flow, not a compression (komatisa) of REM.

Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the text.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, ekipe ya komonana na ekipe ya komonana te ekokani lolenge nini?","The correct answer is **A: Nyonso mibale esengeli kosala mosala lolenge moko (All members must perform a single task)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a ""virtual team"" or ""non-cohesive team"" as one where members don't have a strong, unified approach and don't work together effectively. They often lack clear goals and don't collaborate well. The key point is the lack of a unified approach or a single, shared task.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nyonso mibale ezali na lolenge na yango kosala misala ya mokolo na mokolo (All members are in agreement on their daily tasks):** The text explicitly states they *don't* agree on daily tasks; they lack a cohesive approach.
*   **C: Nyonso mibale bapesaka raport na lisanga ya bakambi moko oyo emonanaka te (All members report to a single, non-cohesive leader):** While the text mentions reports, it's not the defining characteristic of a non-cohesive team. The core issue is the lack of collaboration and unified effort, not just reporting structure.
*   **D: Nyonso mibale esalaka na ngonga moko (All members work with a single agenda):** This is close, but the text emphasizes *lack* of a shared agenda or unifying goal. Non-cohesive teams are defined by a lack of agreement, not necessarily complete disagreement. Option A is a more precise description.



Therefore, the best answer reflects the central idea that non-cohesive teams lack a single, unified purpose or task."
"Kolanda malaoba wana, maloba nini ezali ya solo te na mae matali ekipe yakomonana te na ya komonana?","The correct answer is **C: Baekipe ya komonana ezalaka na lolenge ya kosala yango moko mukie oyo ekokani te na balisanga ya mosika.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a ""virtual team"" that lacks a strong, unified structure.** It highlights that members often work independently, are not well-coordinated, and lack clear, shared goals.  They operate with minimal formal processes.
* **Option C directly reflects this description.** It states that a virtual team is characterized by a lack of a cohesive structure and that its members' work is not necessarily connected to the broader goals of the team.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Baekipe ya komonana ezuamaka mingi:** While they might be efficient in certain tasks, the passage emphasizes their lack of overall strength due to poor coordination.
    * **B: Baekipe ya mosika ezuamaka lokola esika ya bokutani pona baekipe ya komonana:**  The passage actually contrasts the virtual team *against* a traditional team that meets regularly.  It's not saying virtual teams *are* the meeting place for traditional teams.
    * **D: Mbongwana ya bangonga ekoki kozala malamu pona baekipe ya komonana te:** The passage *says* that poor coordination and lack of shared goals make virtual teams vulnerable to challenges.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate summary of the passage's description of virtual teams.



"
Nini na mae malandi ezali te eloko oyo mateya ya bolukiluki etalelaka?,"The correct answer is **B: Lolenge nini esika ya kofanda ebongolaka bizaleli ya moto** (The meaning of when a person's needs are met).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that a sense of purpose and meaning is crucial for self-actualization (bolukiluki).**  It states that people are driven to achieve things that are meaningful to them and that the lack of this meaning can hinder their progress. This aligns strongly with Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory, particularly the need for self-fulfillment and achievement.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Bamposa ya sika oyo ekokisamaka na kimokolo (Immediate financial needs):** While financial security is important (and addresses lower-level needs in Maslow's hierarchy), the passage focuses on deeper, more intrinsic needs related to personal growth and meaning, not just immediate material comforts.
* **C: Bamposa ya kati (Social needs):**  While social connection is important, the core of the passage is about individual growth and purpose.  It doesn't primarily focus on the need for belonging or social acceptance.
* **D: Kososola oyo bato balingaka (Being able to do what people like):** This is a consequence of self-actualization, but not the defining element. The passage is about *why* people want to do what they like – it's driven by a desire for meaning and purpose.



Therefore, the passage's core message is about the **meaning of fulfilling one's needs** as a key element in achieving self-actualization.



"
Kati na mae malandi nini oyo ezali te elongo na rule of third?,"The correct answer is **C: Kobatela sujet na esika moko mpe ya malamu** (Positioning the subject in a single, balanced spot).

Here's why:

* **Rule of Thirds:** The rule of thirds suggests dividing an image into nine equal parts with two horizontal and two vertical lines.  Placing key elements along these lines or at their intersections creates a more visually appealing and balanced composition.

* **Explanation:** Option C directly reflects this concept.  It emphasizes placing the subject in a location that isn't centered but feels balanced within the frame, adhering to the principle of the rule of thirds.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kosala esika malamu oyo sujet ekofanda** (Positioning the subject where it fits naturally): While important, this is a broader concept. The rule of thirds is a specific guideline for achieving a balanced and visually interesting composition.
* **B: Kosala bomoi mpe energie na kati ya foto** (Distributing beauty and energy throughout the photo): This is about visual flow and balance, but doesn't specifically address the placement of the main subject as the rule of thirds does.
* **D: Kotiya bosembo kati ya foto** (Filling all spaces in the photo): This can lead to a cluttered and overwhelming image, which is the opposite of what the rule of thirds aims to avoid.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate description of how the rule of thirds is applied to image composition."
Nini na mae malandi ekoki te kolimbola format 35mm ya foto ?,"The correct answer is **B: Endimamaki na apareil ya foto** (It depends on the camera).

Here's why:

* The passage clearly states that while 35mm film was widely used, modern digital cameras have different sensor sizes. 
* The key point is that the *sensor size* of a digital camera determines how it interprets the image.  If a camera has a smaller sensor than 35mm, it won't be able to capture the full field of view of a 35mm lens.  This is fundamentally determined by the camera's design.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ezali kaka na production** (It's only due to production): While production capabilities *can* be a factor, the core reason for the mismatch is the physical size of the sensor.
* **C: Ezali na talo ya bokeseni koleka ba formats ebele** (It's due to a lower sensitivity compared to many formats): Sensitivity (ISO) is about how well a sensor captures light, not its physical size. 
* **D: Ezali format oyo eyebani na mokili mobimba** (It's a format that is widely recognized in the world):  The recognition of 35mm film is irrelevant to whether a digital camera can replicate its field of view.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, lolenge basali bazali komatisa qualite yakosala ba camera digital, lolenge nini zoom ekomi malamu?","The correct answer is **D: Ezali na makambo ebele te ya point focal lokola bitalatala ya malamu mingi**.

Here's why:

The provided text explains that digital camera zoom is different from optical zoom. Optical zoom *actually* magnifies the image by moving the lens elements closer together. This means the point focal changes, leading to a higher quality image.  Digital zoom, on the other hand, simply crops into the image, making the pixels appear larger. This process doesn't actually add detail; it just enlarges existing pixels, resulting in a loss of image quality.

Option D accurately reflects this.  Digital zoom relies on changing the *point focal* by cropping, and it's a complex process with inherent quality limitations compared to optical zoom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezali na vitesi ya botalatala** - While focal length *is* related to zoom, it's not the primary reason digital zoom is considered problematic. It's the cropping effect.
* **B: Ezali pete pona kosalela na mwinda ya makasi te** -  Zoom isn't *just* for close-up shots.  The quality issue exists regardless of the distance.
* **C: Bafoto nabango ekokani na botalatala ya point focal fixe** - This is incorrect. Digital zoom *changes* the point focal, not keeping it fixed. This change is the problem.



"
"Kolanda bansango ya maloba wana, ngonga nini camera ya zoom ekoki kolingama koleka camera fixe?","The correct answer is **B: Soki olingi bisaleli ya zoom muke**.

Here's why:

The passage states that zoom cameras can achieve better photos than fixed-lens cameras because they can get closer to the subject. This closeness is achieved through a **zoom lens**. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soki aperture ya malamu mingi ezali ya litomba:** Aperture (f-stop) affects depth of field and light gathering, but it's not the *primary* reason zoom cameras are better.  While zoom cameras *can* have wider apertures, it's not inherent to being a zoom camera.
* **C: Soki olongi te kosalela flash na esika ya molili:** Avoiding flash is good photography practice, but it's not specific to zoom cameras making better photos.
* **D: Soki ozali koluka biloko ebele ya point focal:**  Point focal length is what *defines* a zoom lens. The passage already acknowledges the zoom lens, not the multiple point focal lengths.

Therefore, the key advantage of a zoom camera highlighted in the passage is its ability to achieve greater magnification through its zoom lens.
"
Na mae malandi nini ekoki te kozala bolimboli ya solo ya Mysticisme?,"The correct answer is **D: Molende pona koluka experience personel ekokani na bondimi misusu ebele mpe lolenge ya kobondela.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks for things that *aren't* considered the core of mysticism.** Let's analyze each option:
    * **A: Molende ezali makasi na mae matali kozala na esengo mpe kimia na makanisi** (Mysticism is very related to being in ecstasy and alchemy and magic): While some mystical paths might involve these elements, they are *not* the defining characteristic. Mysticism is more about a direct experience of unity or the divine.
    * **B: Bayekoli ya Mysticisme balukaka kozua mayele ya koyeba bosolo ya kimolimo** (Mystics seek to understand the secrets of medicine):  This is a specific application of mystical knowledge, not the core of mysticism itself.  Mysticism isn't solely about healing.
    * **C: Bayekoli ya Mysticisme bakoki kozua bizaleli oyo ekosunga emoneli nabango na makambo ya kibonzambe** (Mystics can perform actions that preserve their awareness of the divine): This describes practices that might *support* a mystical experience, but isn't the essence of mysticism.  It's about maintaining connection, not necessarily performing actions.
    * **D: Molende pona koluka experience personel ekokani na bondimi misusu ebele mpe lolenge ya kobondela** (The emphasis on personal experience is linked to many dimensions and the longing to connect): **This is the most accurate answer.** Mysticism is fundamentally about a *personal, direct* experience of the divine, unity, or the ultimate reality. This experience is often described as transformative and is fueled by a deep longing for connection. The ""many dimensions"" refers to the various paths and expressions of mysticism. The longing to connect is the driving force behind seeking mystical experiences.

Therefore, option D is the only one that describes something that is *not* at the heart of mysticism; it is more a description of what mystical experiences often involve rather than defining the core of the mystical.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana,nini na mae malandi ezali te motuya ya Mysticisme ?","The correct answer is **B: Koluka kososola na nzela ya ba experiences na basusu** (Seeking through experiences in solitude).

Here's why:

* **The question asks what *doesn't* define mysticism.** The passage describes mysticism as a personal experience, a direct connection to the divine, and a path to profound understanding.
* **Option B directly aligns with this description.**  The passage states that mystics ""seek to perceive things as one, a single source of wisdom, or God.""  This seeking often happens through introspection, solitude, and personal experiences, rather than through structured religious practices or intellectual understanding alone.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Koluka bososoli na makambo ya kibonzambe (Seeking through devotion to religious practices):** While devotion can be *part* of a mystical path, the passage emphasizes a more direct, personal connection. It doesn't equate mysticism solely with religious practice.
    * **C: Molende na mae matali kozala na esengo mingi na kati ya makanisi (Emphasis on the importance of solitude within religious institutions):**  Mysticism can occur *outside* of religious institutions, even while practicing devotion.
    * **D: Kolinga kozala na mayele ya koyeba Nzambe (Believing it's about trying to understand God intellectually):** The passage explicitly says that mysticism isn't just about *understanding* God; it's about *experiencing* a connection.



Therefore, option B is the best answer because it reflects the core characteristics of mysticism as described in the passage, and highlights something it *isn't* solely defined by.
"
"Kolanada maloba wana, lnani akokaki kobanda lisanga ya baloni bilanga?","The correct answer is **B: Moriori kouta Chatham Islands**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ezalaki na ekolo mosusu na bisanga ya Chatham, ezalaki ba Maori oyo bayaki wana longwa na Nouvelle-Zelande."" (There is another place in the Chatham Islands, these are Maoris who were exiled from New Zealand.)  It then goes on to explain the history of the Moriori and their relationship to the Maori.  The core of the question is about where the Moriori went.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moriori kouta Nouvelle Zeland:** This is incorrect. The passage indicates Moriori were *exiled* from New Zealand, not that they originated there.
*   **C: Bato ya Maori kouta Polynesie:** This describes the migration of the Maori, not the Moriori.
*   **D: Bato ya Maori kouta Mainland:** While the Maori did migrate to the mainland (New Zealand), the question specifically asks about the Moriori.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, lisanga oyo ebundisaki Bamaos bazalaki bato ya yambo kobika na esika nini ?","The correct answer is **A: The Mainland**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the initial theory was that Maori migrated to New Zealand from Polynesia and took over from the Moriori, who were the original inhabitants of the ""Mainland."" The later evidence suggests the Moriori were descendants of Maori who went to the Chatham Islands.

Therefore, the answer is **The Mainland** as it refers to the original landmass of New Zealand before the migration to the Chatham Islands.
"
Na lolenge nini bosaleli ya Pureland method ya origami epesi litomba na mazita?,"The correct answer is **A: Mazita elingaka kosala bamizita ebele mbala moko**.

Here's why:

The question asks about *when* the Pureland method of origami requires folding a lot of paper. The provided text states: ""eza origami moko oyo eza na bipekiseli oyo kaka bakoki kokanga kaka lizita moko na mbala moko, mazita ya mpasi neti mazita oyo ebaluka epesami te ndingisa pe mazita mingi ezalaka na bisika ya pete.""  This translates to: ""It's an origami technique where only those with expertise can fold a single sheet of paper only once, a lot of paper and paper that is creased or wrinkled does not work and a lot of paper is placed in a pile.""  This indicates that the method is designed for using *one* sheet of paper and requiring a high level of skill to achieve that with a single fold.

The options:

*   **A: Mazita elingaka kosala bamizita ebele mbala moko (Paper needs to be folded many times):** This is the *opposite* of what the text describes. It's about folding *once*.
*   **B: Mosali lizita esali ete mayele ya kosalela moto ekoba makasi (The skill of folding is based on the number of folds):**  The text doesn't directly link skill to the number of folds, only to the ability to fold *once* successfully.
*   **C: Mosali lizita ezali kosala origami oyo esengi kozala na lizita pona kokanga (The skill of folding is about folding origami that is meant to be done with one sheet of paper for recognition):** This is closer to the core concept, but doesn't explicitly state *when* this happens, it only states what the method *is*.
*   **D: Mosali lizita asi ameki yango kaka mbala moko to mbala mibale (The skill of folding is only known once or several times):** The text refers to *one* fold, so this is a reasonable, but not as direct answer as A.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer because the text explicitly states the method relies on folding paper only once.  While option D mentions one time, it doesn't directly connect to the ""folding many times"" phrasing of the question, while option A is the direct opposite of what is stated in the text."
Na mae malandi nini oyo elimboli malamu te Pureland Origami?,"The correct answer is **A: Ezali pona basalimazita oyo bazali na boyebi makasi** (It's for experienced paper folders).

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Origami Pureland eza origami moko oyo eza na bipekiseli oyo kaka bakoki kokanga kaka lizita moko na mbala moko, mazita ya mpasi neti mazita oyo ebaluka epesami te ndingisa pe mazita mingi ezalaka na bisika ya pete.""  This translates to: ""Origami Pureland is a single origami that has complexities that only experienced folders can fold in one go, many folds and complex folds do not straighten and many folds are in the corner.""  This clearly indicates that it's a very difficult origami designed for skilled paper folders.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Method wana ezalaka te na mazita yakokanga** (This method does not use glue) - The text doesn't mention glue, but that isn't the defining characteristic of Pureland origami.
* **C: Mazita esengeli kozala na bisika ya kozala semba** (The paper must be in a certain orientation) - While the paper orientation is likely important for such a complex model, the text doesn't specify this.
* **D: Ezali method ya malamu pona basali mazita oyo bazali na mayele ebele te pona kosalela moto** (It's a simple method for people who have many folds to fold for someone) - The text explicitly says it's *not* a simple method and is for *experienced* folders.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, esika nini oyo elandani te na civilization Indus Valley ?","The correct answer is **D: Most of modern-day Pakistan**. 

Here's why:

* The question asks what location is *not* part of the Indus Valley Civilization. 
* The passage explicitly states that the Indus Valley Civilization was located in ""nordi weste ya kontina moke ya Inde, ezalaki kozwa eteni monene ya Pakistan ya lelo mpe biteni mosusu ya nordi weste ya Inde mpe nordi este ya Afghanistan."" This means most of modern-day Pakistan *is* part of the civilization.
*  Harappa is a major city within the Indus Valley Civilization.
* The Sarasvati River was important to the civilization, and its location is debated but considered part of the region.
* North-west Afghanistan is considered part of the broader region influenced by the Indus Valley Civilization.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* part of the Indus Valley Civilization, according to the passage, is most of modern-day Pakistan.



"
Kombo nini oyo ekoki te kozala kombo ya Civilization ya Mbula ya Bronze lolenge elobami na maloba wana,"The correct answer is **D: The Indus Valley Civilization**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...ezalaka kozwa eteni monene ya Pakistan ya lelo mpe biteni mosusu ya nordi weste ya Inde mpe nordi este ya Afghanistan.""  This directly identifies the civilization as located in the Indus Valley.
* **""Indus Valley Civilization"" is a commonly accepted and accurate name** for this Bronze Age civilization.
* **The other options are either:**
    * **A: The Harappan Civilization:** Harappa is a major city of the Indus Valley Civilization, but the civilization itself is broader than just Harappa.  While often used interchangeably, ""Indus Valley Civilization"" is the more encompassing and preferred term in academic contexts.
    * **B: Indus-Sarasvati Civilization:**  While the Sarasvati River was important, the civilization isn't solely defined by it. The Indus River is the defining geographical feature.  The term ""Indus-Sarasvati Civilization"" is less commonly used and can be misleading.
    * **C: The Indus River Civilization:** This is too narrow.  While the Indus River is central, the civilization extended throughout the Indus Valley, not just along the river itself.



Therefore, **The Indus Valley Civilization** is the most accurate and complete designation based on the information provided in the text.

"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi epesaka litomba ya ngonga molai?","The correct answer is **C: Kotiya molende na oyo ekosalisa bato ebele na esika ya bato mukie.**

Here's why:

* **The Question:** The question asks *why* the feeling of loneliness is a powerful ache.
* **The Context:** The prompt states that loneliness arises when many people are busy with things *before* you, and that people often feel lonely because their desire for affection isn't met.  It connects loneliness to a sense of being overlooked or unprioritized.
* **Why C is correct:**  ""Kotiya molende na oyo ekosalisa bato ebele na esika ya bato mukie"" translates to ""Missing out on what others are doing in a crowd of people.""  This directly relates to the feeling of being left out, ignored, or not included – the core of why loneliness can be so painful.  It implies seeing others enjoying things while you are separate.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Koyokana na basusu (Being with many people):**  Being surrounded by people doesn't automatically dispel loneliness. You can be in a crowd and still feel isolated.
* **B: Kotiya litomba nayomoko liboso (Missing out on things constantly):** While missing out can contribute to feeling left out, it doesn't fully explain the intensity of loneliness. 
* **D: Koyeba ete lokoso ekoki kozala na litomba (Knowing that loneliness can be a powerful feeling):** This is a statement of fact, not an explanation of *why* loneliness is so powerfully felt.



Therefore, option **C** best explains why loneliness is a strong, painful ache, given the context provided.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini oyo moto akoki kotalela lokola eloko ya motuya mingi soki mposa naye ezali ya kozua litomba nokinoki?","The correct answer is **B: Kosalela elongo nabasuu (Building relationships with others)**.

Here's why:

* **The Question:** The question asks what a person can do to be more resilient when facing challenges and setbacks.  The problem highlighted is the tendency to isolate oneself when things go wrong.
* **The Context:** The provided text states that people often withdraw and become isolated when facing difficulties.  It also notes that the human need for connection is strong.
* **Why B is Correct:** Building relationships with others directly counteracts the isolating tendency.  Having a support network provides emotional support, practical help, and a sense of belonging – all crucial for resilience.
* **Why Other Options are Less Suitable:**
    * **A: Kozanga kimoimi (Self-pity/feeling sorry for oneself):** While feeling down is normal, dwelling on self-pity is detrimental to resilience.
    * **C: Boyokani (Reflection/introspection):**  Reflection is valuable, but it shouldn't be the *primary* coping mechanism for building resilience. It needs to be balanced with action.
    * **D: Kozanga kimoimi (Self-pity/feeling sorry for oneself):**  Repeatedly offering the same answer doesn't make it correct.



Therefore, actively cultivating and maintaining relationships is the most effective strategy for building resilience when feeling overwhelmed.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani afutaki mbongo ebele ya Bitumba?","The correct answer is **B: Wall Street banks**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Badepanse ya bitumba ya baniokoli ya Etats-Unis mpona kobotola Philippines efutamaki na bato ya Philippines bango moko. Bapusamaki na kofuta bampako na bokonzi ya Etats-Unis mpona kofuta mbongo mingi ya badepanse pe matomba ya masengami oyo ezalaki na bokonzi ya Philippines na nzela ya babanke ya Wall Street.""

This directly translates to: ""The profits from the exploitation of the resources of the Philippines are not benefiting the people of the Philippines themselves. They are asking the government of the United States to recover much of the profits and the debts of the securities that are held by the Philippines through Wall Street banks.""

This clearly indicates that Wall Street banks are the ones profiting heavily from the exploitation of Philippine resources.
"
Tango nini eyaki liboso ya mbula Templiers?,"The correct answer is **C: Bileko ya moyen age ya kati (Middle Ages)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""eleko ya lisolo ya Erope na ekeke ya 11, 12, 13 (1000–1300 ya ntango na biso). Eleko Moyen Âge ya likolo eyaki nsima ya eleko Moyen Âge ya se, oyo ndenge balobaka esukaki pene ya mobu 1500."" This translates to ""the era of European history in the 11th, 12th, 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD). This early Middle Ages precedes the later Middle Ages, which lasts until around 1500.""

While the Templars were most prominent during the 12th century, the text defines their historical context as the Middle Ages (Moyen Âge).  Option C is the most accurate and encompasses the timeframe mentioned in the text.
"
Tango nini nde eyaki yambo sima ya mbula ya baTempliers?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekeke to siecle ya 12**.

The text states: ""Mbula oyo makambo wana esalemaki, babengaka yango mbala mingi Moyen Age ya Likolo, eleko ya lisolo ya Erope na ekeke ya 11, 12, 13 (1000–1300 ya ntango na biso).""

This translates to: ""This matter often occurred during the Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).""  Therefore, the 12th century (Ekeke ya 12) is a key period for the Templars.
"
Lolenge nini ya kobikisa to lolenge ya minganga kosala oyo elobami te kosalema na minganga na tango ya Kibokonzi ya Roma?,"The correct answer is **D: Kokata makolo pona kobikisa babeli ya bagangrenes**.

Here's why:

* The provided text explicitly states: ""Bayebaki malamu kokata makolo mpona kobikisa bato ya maladi na maladi ya gangrène pe na garrots pe na mabanga oyo ekangaka makila nzela na kotambola."" (They were eager to use laudanum to treat patients with gangrene, ulcers, and wounds that were slow to heal.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kopesa bato kisi pona kozanga kimia koleka na nzela ya bakisi Sedative** - While sedatives were used, the text doesn't mention them specifically as a primary treatment method during the Roman Empire.
* **B: Kosalela bambuma ya herbane pona scopolamine** - The text mentions scopolamine, but it's linked to ""bambuma ya herbane"" (herbal medicines), implying it was part of a broader herbal approach, not the main treatment.
* **C: Kosala makila eleka na misisa** -  The text mentions ""makila eleka na misisa"" (slow healing wounds) but only in the context of the conditions being treated with laudanum, not as a method of healing itself.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini elobami te kozala na kati ya makambo ya bokolisi ya kimonganga oyo esalemaki na tango ya Bokonzi ya Baroma ?","The correct answer is **C: Lolenge ya kozala ya balopitalo pona koyekola** (The concept of hospitals for treatment).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Romans used medical knowledge to treat illnesses and injuries, even using advanced techniques and substances like morphine and scopolamine. However, it *doesn't* mention the existence of hospitals as we know them today for organized patient care and treatment. While they had specialized healers and treatments, a formal hospital system was not developed during the Roman Empire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lolenge ya kozala ya lisanga ya baminganga** (The concept of medical associations): While there were likely groups of healers and physicians, the text doesn't emphasize a formalized medical association structure.
* **B: Matta ya Basoda ya Bokonzi wana** (The methods of the Roman Asclepius/healing practices): The text *does* discuss healing practices, but it focuses on the specific treatments and substances used, not a broader categorization of their healing ""methods"" in general.
* **D: Lolenge Mokonzi azalaki kotiya minganga na mosala** (The concept of the Empire investing heavily in medicine): The text confirms the Empire invested in medicine, but it doesn't imply this investment resulted in the creation of hospitals.



Therefore, the absence of hospitals for treatment is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
Makoki pona komona etali eloko nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Mbongwana ya ba degree ya acuity**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the ability of the eye to see detail and distinguish objects.** This is directly related to the concept of visual acuity, which is a measure of the eye's sharpness of vision.
* **Option A (Biteni ya nzoto oyo esungaka emoneli - Structures of the eye that make up the eye) is too general.** While important, it doesn't specifically address the *ability* to see detail.
* **Option B (Bosenga ya nzoto - The physiology of the eye) is also too general.** It covers the overall function but not the specific measure of sharpness.
* **Option C (Koyeba koyokela bamolai ya ba onde - Knowing the number of rods in the eye) is incorrect.** While rods are important for vision, the passage focuses on the overall *ability* to discern details, not just the number of rods.

Therefore, **Mbongwana ya ba degree ya acuity** (the degree of acuity) is the most accurate answer because it directly relates to the eye's ability to see detail and distinguish objects, which is what the passage is describing."
Mbongwana na biteni ya miso na kati ya baoraganismes ya nzoto etalelaka nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Nivo to kimolai ya acuity (Level of acuity)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes how the ability to detect stimuli (like movement) in insects is related to the number and distribution of sensory receptors.
* **Acuity** refers to the sharpness or clarity of vision or other senses.  In this context, it refers to the *level* or *degree* of sensitivity or responsiveness of an organism to stimuli.  The passage directly states that the degree of sensitivity changes based on the number and arrangement of receptors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kimolai ya koyokela baondes (Level of detection of movements):** While related, this is not the best description. The passage explains *how* the detection of movement occurs (through receptors), not just the act of detecting movement itself.
* **B: Bosengi ya Nzoto to organismes (Physiological properties of organisms):** This is too broad. While sensory perception is a physiological property, the passage focuses specifically on the *level* of sensitivity.
* **D: Mikakatano ya Nzoto (Species Interactions):** This option is completely unrelated to the passage's focus on sensory perception within an organism.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini pona mae matali bondimi ya Sikhisme elimboli yango malamu te?","The correct answer is **A: Sikhisme ebotamaki kouta bokabwani kati na Kibokoko ya Hindu**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Bato ya Shikhs bamonaka bindimeli na bango ete ekabwana na ya lingomba ya Hindu atako bandimaka ete euta na Hindu pe balandaka mimeseno na yango."" This means Sikhism originated *in opposition* to Hinduism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Guru eza likambo ya ntina mingi mpona Sikhisme:** While true (as stated in the passage), the question asks for something that *doesn't* symbolize Sikhism. The significance of the Guru *is* a core symbol.
* **C: Baguru libwa balandaki sima ya mozalisi ya lingomba, Guru Nanak:** Again, true according to the passage, but not something that *doesn't* symbolize Sikhism. Guru Nanak is a central figure.
* **D: Mimesano misusu ya Sikhisme eutaki na Hinduismes:** The passage states the opposite: Sikhism arose *because* of disagreements and opposition to Hinduism.

Therefore, the only answer that correctly reflects something Sikhism *doesn't* symbolize, based on the passage, is that it originated from conflict with Hinduism.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezali lokola eloko ya motuya mingi na lingomba ya Sikhisme ?","The correct answer is **A: Liteya ya Guru (Teachings of the Guru)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""na Sikhisme eza ndimbola oyo esala ete ezala moboko ya bindimeli na bango. Basalaki lingomba wana na ekeke ya 15 na Guru Nanak...""  This highlights the central role of the Gurus (teachers/spiritual leaders) in Sikhism.  Their teachings (Gurmat) are foundational.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kibokoko ya Hindu (Hindu tradition)**: While Sikhism originated in the context of Hinduism and initially reacted *against* some aspects of it, it's not the core *defining* element. The passage stresses Sikhism's distinctiveness.
* **C: Koboya kondima mangomba misusu ya Inde (Emulating other Indian religions)**: Sikhism is unique and doesn't simply copy other religions. It has its own distinct path.
* **D: Kosolola lokota ya Punjabi (Promoting the Punjabi language)**: While Punjabi is important to Sikh culture, it is not the core theological element of the religion.



Therefore, the **Teachings of the Guru** (Liteya ya Guru) are the most significant aspect highlighted in the passage as defining Sikhism.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bana oyo bazali na bokono ya kozanga kotia likebi bazalaka na mikakatano pona kotiya likebi na nini?","The correct answer is **A: Misala ya kelasi**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bana oyo babelaka TDA bakokaka te kotia makanisi esika moko na makambo neti misala ya kelasi..."" (Children with ADHD can't focus on things like schoolwork...). This directly links the difficulty with focusing to schoolwork (misala ya kelasi).

While the text mentions other things they *do* focus on (anime, drawing, repeating phrases), it's contrasting those with their *inability* to focus on schoolwork.
"
"Kolanada maloba wana, pona nini bana ya Maladi ya kozanga kotia likebi balingaka kozala na bizaleli ya makama?","The correct answer is **D: Kolamusa Boongo nabango (To seek comfort in it)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...mpo **bazalaka na bizaleli ya mabe, babundaka, mpe batosaka te bokonzi** mpona koningisa boongo na bango, mpo bakoki te kopusa boongo na bango esala na ndenge ya malamu."" 

This translates to: ""...because they are **in bad spirits, restless, and lack self-control** to seek comfort in it, because they cannot soothe the evil within them in a healthy way.""

Therefore, the passage indicates that the children are seeking comfort and a way to cope with their internal struggles through the repetitive actions of drawing and watching anime.  Options A, B, and C aren't directly supported by the passage.



"
"Kolanda bansango na maloba wana, na bandakisa mae malandi ndakisa nini oyo ezali ya échafaudages te ?","The correct answer is **C: Malengeli ya koyekola ya mutu yemoko (Personalized Learning Software)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes scaffolding as a tool to support learning.** It explains how scaffolding provides support for learners to tackle complex tasks, offering hints, guidance, and structured frameworks.
* **Personalized learning software** fits this description. Such software adapts to individual learning needs, offering tailored support, practice, and feedback – essentially providing scaffolding for the student.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tutoriel na ebandeli ya lisano ya ordinatere (Online Computer Tutorials):** While helpful, tutorials are generally more structured and less adaptive than scaffolding. They aren't specifically designed to dynamically adjust support based on a student's individual progress.
* **B: Molakisi ya SAT (SAT Coach):**  A SAT coach provides guidance on test-taking strategies, but it doesn't offer the dynamic, supportive frameworks that scaffolding does.
* **D: Coach ya mukie ya Ligue (League Youth Coach):** A sports coach focuses on physical skills and team dynamics, which is unrelated to the concept of scaffolding in educational contexts.



"
Na mae malandi nini elimboli malamu te likambo ya échafaudages ?,"The correct answer is **D: Échafaudages esalemaka pona kopesa lisungi na ebandeli ya boyekoli**.

Here's why:

The text describes scaffolding as a way to provide support and structure for complex tasks, particularly in programming and software development. It allows developers to build upon existing frameworks and libraries, making the process easier and more efficient. This directly relates to improving the development process (ebandeli ya boyekoli).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Échafaudages ekoki kozala na internet:** While scaffolding can be *related* to internet technologies, it isn't inherently *defined* by being on the internet.
* **B: Ezali mingi lokola lisungi kasi lolenge ya koyekola te:** While scaffolding provides structure, its primary purpose isn't *just* to be a support; it's to facilitate and speed up development.  It *helps* with development.
* **C: Eyebani mpe lokola koyekola na lolenge ya projet:** Scaffolding *can* be used within a project, but it's a broader concept of supporting development processes, not solely tied to project management.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya Myspace ekoki kosalisa moyekoli oyo azali na mikakatano pona kotanga?","The correct answer is **A: Customization**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Okoki kozala bongisa yango mpo eza pete na kotanga mpe ekoki kozala na couleur mingi to moke ndenge olingi."" This translates to ""It can be customized for appearance and can be very colorful or whatever you like.""  ""Customization"" directly refers to the ability to personalize the website's appearance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Blogs:** While MySpace had blogs, the passage focuses on the visual appearance and ease of use, not blogging features.
* **C: One web address:** The passage says that only a single web address is needed to access a profile, but this is about ease of access, not addressing the issue of difficulties with typing.
* **D: 54 million profiles:**  The number of profiles is irrelevant to the problem of making typing easier.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezalaki te kati ya biyano ya Krushchev na botomboki ya bato ya mosala","The correct answer is **B: Kosalela bashare pona kozongisa molongo** (Calling for the replacement of party leaders to stabilize the situation).

Here's why:

The text states that Krushchev called for the replacement of party leaders in Poland to stabilize the situation (""Atako na suka, Krushchev atindaki bashare mpona kotia molongo"").  The other options are not the primary reason Krushchev took this action. While he did try to replace the Prime Minister (which is part of stabilizing), the core action described is calling for the replacement of leaders overall. He also didn't specifically focus on ending the ""salere"" (repression), though that was a consequence. And he didn't just ""kondima makambo mosusu ya nkita"" (report more on the situation).



"
Na mae malandi nini ezalaki te kati ya bantina ya botomboki na Mboka Pologne?,"The correct answer is **D: Kotiyama ya Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Polish protests in 1956 were fueled by a desire for change and a rejection of the Communist regime.  The protests were about more than just wanting a different leader; they were about greater autonomy and a move away from Soviet control.

The passage mentions:

*   **Bato basalaki mobulu na Pologne wana bato basalaki kopesa bango mpe bakitisaki salere na bango:** People were asking for more and protesting.
*   **Krushchev atindaki bashare mpona kotia molongo, andimaki makambo mosusu ya nkita oyo basengaki ye pe andimaki kotia Wladyslaw Gomulka:** Khrushchev agreed to changes and appointed Wladyslaw Gomulka as Prime Minister.

While the other options were *part* of the protests (a desire for change, a desire to organize, and the act of protesting itself), the key turning point and the core demand that upset the Soviet leadership was the desire to have **Wladyslaw Gomulka** in power. The Soviets were wary of Gomulka's potential independence from Moscow.

Therefore, the answer is D.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini esalaki mabe te na boyokani kati ya URSS na USA to Mboka Amerika?","The correct answer is **C: Bokeseni ya lolenge ya kosala Makambo (Ideological differences)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Suka ya bitumba mpe kobeba ya ebongiseli, ya lolenge ya kosala makambo pe bokoko, esalaki ete ekolo ekabwana."" (The Cold War, and the rise of ideologies, of action and debate, caused the world to split.) This directly points to ideological differences as the core cause.
* **The passage mentions:** The split of Europe, the formation of blocs, and the arms race. These are all direct consequences of differing ideologies (Communism vs. Capitalism).
* **The other options are less accurate:**
    * **A: Bokeseni ya kibokoko (Arms race):** While the arms race was a significant part of the Cold War, it was a *result* of the ideological differences, not the fundamental cause.
    * **B: Bamakanisi na mae matali Mboka Alemagne (Intervention by the Western European powers):**  While European powers played a role, the core conflict wasn't about interventions by Western Europe. It was about the global ideological struggle.
    * **D: Kosuana mpona mae matali lolenge ya kosala misala (Competition for influence based on the ideology of action):** This is a bit convoluted, but the core issue is the fundamentally different *ideologies* themselves, not just the competition *based* on them.



Therefore, **C** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
Na mae malandi nini elimboli malamu te litomba ya kotinda basango na bansinga ya boongo na nzoto?,"The correct answer is **C: Kobatela bahoméostasie** (Disrupting homeostasis).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Boongo na biso ebatelaka homéostasie ndenge etindaka basango na bansinga ya boongo na nzoto mpona makila ekoba kotambola pe etambola malamu."" (Our disease disrupts homeostasis in a way that causes damage to tissues in the body for as long as it persists and progresses slowly.)
* **Homeostasis** is the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment.  Disease, by its nature, disrupts this balance.  When homeostasis is disrupted, the body's normal functions are impaired, leading to damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosala makila etambola malembe** (Having frequent progress): While disease often progresses, the *reason* it damages tissues is the disruption of homeostasis, not the frequency of progress.
* **B: Kotalela etamboli ya makila** (Following the progress of the month): This is irrelevant to the underlying mechanism of disease.
* **D: Kokebisa makama na nzoto** (Focusing on the tissues):  The disease doesn't just focus on tissues; it disrupts the overall bodily balance (homeostasis) which *then* affects tissues.



"
Nini ekoki kozuama na Plateau ya Giza?,"The correct answer is **C: Makamwisi nyonso sambo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Plateau ya Giza, to """"Giza Necropolis"""" na Lobwaku ya Liwa ya Egypte eza na bapiramide mingi (piramide monene eleki nyonso na monene), **bankunda mingi ya mike, batempelo mingi, mpe Sphinx monene.**""

This means the Plateau of Giza contains tombs (makamwisi) in addition to pyramids, temples, and the Sphinx. Option C is the most encompassing and accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Litomba ya Pyramide ya munene koleka ezalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Kokumisa Faraon**.

The text explicitly states: ""Piramide monene basalaki yango mpona kokumisa Farao Khufu..."" (The Great Pyramid was built to bury Pharaoh Khufu...).
"
Nani asalaki mayele nabiso ya Arson oyo ebebisaki tempelo?,"The correct answer is **A: The Ephesians**.

The text states: ""Bato ya Efezo, basilikaki, balobaki ete bakokoma lisusu te nkombo ya Herostratus."" which translates to ""The people of Ephesus, they were enraged, and said they would never build a temple to Herostratus again.""  This implies they were the ones who responded to his arson.
"
Maloba nini ezali ya solo na mae matali botongi lisusu ya lingomba ya Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Etongamaki lisusu sima ya bokonzi ya Alexander the Great**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after the temple was burned down, Alexander the Great offered money to rebuild it. This was a direct act of his leadership and power. Option B accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Botongisi lisusu efutamaki na Alexander the Great:** While Alexander initiated the rebuilding, it wasn't solely *because* of his personal desire. It was an act of leadership and a public gesture.
* **C: Bapesaki ndingisa na Herostratus ya kofuta pona botongisi lisusu:**  The passage doesn't mention anything about punishing Herostratus for the fire.
* **D: Etongamaki lisusu na 320 liboso ya bantango nabiso:** While the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC, the rebuilding itself was initiated by Alexander the Great.  The date is a consequence, not the primary reason for the rebuilding.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, tango nini ezalaki nokinoki mingi oyo bikelamu bakokaki kotambola na makolo mibale?","The correct answer is **B: Bambula million mibale eleki**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bato bayebi bipèdes bazali na bafossiles ya Australopithecus oyo eumela banda mibu bamilio 4,2-3,9..."" which translates to ""Scientists know bipeds from fossils of Australopithecus that date back 4.2-3.9 million years...""

The question asks when it became more common for hominids to walk upright. The passage indicates that *Australopithecus* (a bipedal hominid) existed and walked upright around 4.2-3.9 million years ago.  Therefore, the answer must be ""Bambula million mibale eleki"" (Millions of years ago). The other options are too specific to the information given.
"
Na Bikelamu oyo nani abandaki kotambola na makolo mibale na ngonga nyonso?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

The passage states: ""atako Sahelanthropus atambolaki na makolo mibale mibu bamilio nsambo esi eleki."" This translates to ""while Sahelanthropus walked in the early days."" Therefore, Sahelanthropus is the species mentioned as walking in the earliest period.
"
Masuwa ya Alemgne ebandaki komeka kosala nini na tango ya Etumba WWII?,"The correct answer is **A: Kobotola biloko kouta na Grande Britagne (Invade Great Britain)**.

The text states: ""Bato ya Amerika bazalaki koluka kotinda bato na biloko na bango ya mbu ya Atlantique mpona kosalisa Grande Bretagne. Na ntango wana moko, basoda ya Allemagne ya mai, oyo basalelaki mingi bamasuwa, bazalaki koluka kokanga bato nzela. Soki baninga balongaki te, Allemagne alingaki kobotola Grande Bretagne ndenge abotolaka Eropa mobimba.""

Translation: ""The Americans were trying to send things to the shores of the Atlantic in order to save Great Britain. Therefore, the German navy soldiers, who were very skilled at sinking ships, were trying to prevent these things from reaching Great Britain. If they didn't, Germany would invade Great Britain and conquer Europe massively.""

This clearly indicates Germany's goal was to invade Great Britain.
"
"Kolanda bansango oyo epesami na maloba wana, nani alongaki makasi na etumba ya mai na Campagne ya Atlantique ya nordi?","The correct answer is **C: Ba Alemans na Ba Britanique**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kosalela bamasuwa mpona komema biloko eza lolenge ya malamu koleka ya kokatisa bato ebele mpenza na bilko mingi na mbu."" (Using spies to gather information is the most effective way to get information from many people at once.) This implies both sides were using spies.
* **The passage mentions:** ""Moko ya bandakisa ya malamu koleka ya likambo wana ezalaki Kampanie WWII ya Atlantiqueya nordi."" (One of the most effective applications of this was the Battle of the Atlantic.) This identifies the specific campaign.
* **The passage describes:** ""Bato ya Amerika bazalaki koluka kotinda bato na biloko na bango ya mbu ya Atlantique mpona kosalisa Grande Bretagne."" (Americans were trying to capture spies in the Atlantic to save Great Britain.) This indicates the Americans were actively trying to capture German spies.
* **The passage also describes:** ""Basoda ya Allemagne ya mai, oyo basalelaki mingi bamasuwa, bazalaki koluka kokanga bato nzela."" (German naval soldiers, who used many spies, were trying to mislead people.) This shows the Germans were actively using spies and trying to mislead the Allies.

Therefore, both the Germans and the British were engaged in the use of spies during the Battle of the Atlantic.



"
Na tango ba Asyriens babandaki kosalela Calvary nini ezalaki naino te na tango wana?,"The correct answer is **A: Bifandelo likolo ya punda (Horseback)**.

The text states: ""Lokola basalaki naino te esika ya kofandela, basoda ya Assirie oyo babundaki likolo ya mpunda bafandaki kaka boye likolo ya bampunda na bitumba."" This translates to: ""Since they were not used for fighting, the Assyrian soldiers who rode horses only used the horses for transport and for carrying equipment.""

Therefore, the reason cavalry wasn't effective was because the horses were primarily used for transport, not for actual combat.
"
Bitumba oyo esalelaka ba cavaliers ebundanaka lolenge nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Likolo ya punda**.

The text states: ""Cavalier eza soda oyo abundaka likolo ya mpunda."" which translates to ""A cavalier is a soldier who has a lot of horsehair (or mane/hair).""  The text then goes on to describe the horses' appearance and how they were used.  Therefore, the carriages used by the cavaliers are made of horsehair.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na esika nini okoki te kokuta moto simple ya Mboka Babylone?","The correct answer is **A: Komema ba mbeka na lopango ya tempelo**.

Here's why:

The text states that only priests were allowed to make offerings *on the altar* of the temple.  The other options are plausible, but the text specifically restricts offerings to the altar, implying that commoners would not have been allowed near that area.
"
Na mae malandi nini oyo ezalaki kaka pona batumbi mbeka,"The correct answer is **A: BaFestivals**.

Here's why:

The text describes the ziggurats as temples dedicated to the gods, where people would offer sacrifices.  Festivals were a common part of religious practice in ancient Mesopotamia, and they would be a time for special offerings and worship at the temples (ziggurats).  The text doesn't mention ""Etumbelo ya kati"" (Central Courts), ""Ba mayangani"" (Other Buildings), or ""Ziggurats"" themselves as the *reason* people came to worship. Festivals were the events *for* the worship.

Na tango nini Mokonzi Tutankhamun azuaki lokumu mpe koyebana ?,"The correct answer is **C: Sima ya komona lilita naye** (The time of discovering his tomb).

The passage states: ""Ata soki malita mingi ya kala bayiba yango, lilita wana etikala kaka ndenge ezalaki. Biloko ebele oyo bakunda na Toutankhamon, babatela yango malamu, ata mpe biloko ebele oyo basala na bibende ya ntina pe mabanga oyo emonanaka mingi te.""  This translates to ""Even though many ancient rulers knew of him, his tomb remained just as it was. Many things people attribute to Tutankhamun, they give it names, even many things they do with his artifacts and the reasons they are seen often.""  The key point is that the discovery of the tomb in 1922 is what brought him significant recognition.  The passage highlights that before 1922, he wasn't very well known.



Therefore, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 is the reason he became famous.



"
Nini esalaki ete Mokonzi Tutankhamun akoma mokonzi ya Egypte oyo ayebani?,"The correct answer is **A: Komonana ya lilita naye oyo bayibaki te** (Discovering his tomb).

The passage states: ""Ata soki malita mingi ya kala bayiba yango, lilita wana etikala kaka ndenge ezalaki. Biloko ebele oyo bakunda na Toutankhamon, babatela yango malamu, ata mpe biloko ebele oyo basala na bibende ya ntina pe mabanga oyo emonanaka mingi te."" This means even if there were many historical records, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 led to a much greater understanding of him.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Esika naye na liste ya mikonzi ya kala** (His inclusion on the list of ancient rulers): The passage explicitly says they didn't know much about him in ancient times, so he wasn't a prominent ruler on any ancient lists.
*   **C: Kimoyibi ya ba artifacts bankoto na kati ya lilita naye** (The wealth of artifacts found in his tomb): While the artifacts are important, the discovery *of the tomb itself* is what fundamentally changed understanding of Tutankhamun. The passage highlights that the tomb's discovery revealed a level of preservation and detail previously unknown.
*   **D: Litomba naye na tango ya civilization ya Egypte** (His connection to the civilization of Egypt): While he's a part of Egyptian civilization, the passage focuses on *why* his understanding increased – it was the discovery of his tomb.

Therefore, the discovery of his tomb is the key reason he became such a well-known and understood pharaoh.
"
Eloko nini poete ya mboka Grece Homer akokaki te?,"The correct answer is **A: Koyoka**.

The text states that Homer ""akufa miso pe ayebana mingi"" (died long ago and is well-known), implying he is deceased and therefore cannot be doing anything currently.  The other options – seeing, composing, and speaking – are actions Homer could have done in his life.
"
Moto nini kouta Grece oyo ayebani makasi libanda ya mosala ya kokoma?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

The passage states: ""Moto ya Grece mosusu oyo ayebana mingi eza moto ya mathematique Pythagore, ya ebana mingi mpona makanisi na ye na ntina etali boyokani na kati ya bandambo ya batriangles oyo eza rectangle.""  This translates to: ""The most well-known Greek person who studied a lot is the mathematician Pythagoras, who studied a lot for his theories on the connection between numbers and the relationship between triangles that are rectangles.""

While Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes were important figures, the passage specifically highlights Pythagoras' connection to mathematics and his understanding of geometrical relationships, making him the one most associated with the concept of understanding the world through logic and reason (the ""kokoma"" - thinking/reasoning).
"
Esika nini libota ya Ba Ebele elekisaki ngonga mingi?,"The correct answer is **A: Na Libanda (In the desert)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Na climat ya moto ya Moyen-Orient, ndako ezalaki te ntina mingi."" (In the hot climate of the Middle East, there isn't much water.) and ""Basalelaki mabanga mpona kotonda bandako."" (They prayed for rain.) This directly connects the need for rain to the desert environment.



The other options don't align with the information provided:

*   **B: Na Nzela (By way of prayer):** While they prayed, the question asks *where* the prayer was effective, not *how* it was effective.
*   **C: Na Kati ya Lopango (In the middle of the plains):** The text emphasizes the lack of water in a *hot* climate, implying a desert, not plains.
*   **D: Na Kati ya ndako (In the middle of the house):** The text is about the environment outside the house, specifically the lack of water and the prayers for rain.



"
Nini oyo ezalaki ya litomba mingi te pona libota ya ba Ebele ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba ndako nabango (Their houses)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Na climat ya moto ya Moyen-Orient, ndako ezalaki te ntina mingi."" which translates to ""In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses are not plentiful.""  The text goes on to explain that people seek refuge in the shade and that shops are often used as places to escape the heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Climat nabango (Their climate):** While the climate is a factor, the question asks *what* is difficult for the people of the Middle East, not just the climate itself.
* **B: Ba depots nabango (Their depots/warehouses):** The passage doesn't mention warehouses.
* **D: Elambeli nabango (Their prayers):** The passage mentions people praying, but it doesn't say that their prayers are a problem or difficulty.

Therefore, the most direct answer based on the text is that **houses** are scarce and a major issue for the people of the Middle East."
Na mae malandi nini elimbolami malamu te neti bokeseni kati ya bamboka ya skandinave?,"The correct answer is **D: Bato**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ata mboka mokomoko ezalaki ya 'Scandinavie', ezalaki na bokeseni mingi na bato, bakonzi, bizaleli pe lisolo na kati Danemark, Suède, Norvège pe Islande."" This translates to: ""Even the term 'Scandinavia' isn't exactly a geographic term; it's a broader term referring to people, organizations, customs, and a region between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.""

The question asks why the term ""Scandinavia"" doesn't perfectly align with the geographical area. The text clarifies it's more about the *people* who share a common cultural and historical background.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Istware ya moko na moko (A single history):** While there's a shared history, the text focuses on the people's shared identity more than a singular historical narrative.
* **B: Mabele (Mountains):** The text doesn't mention mountains as a defining factor.
* **C: Kibokoko (Birds):** The text doesn't mention birds as a defining factor.



"
Nani efandaki na Greenland yambo?,"The correct answer is **A: Bikolo ya ba eskimo** (Eskimo people).

The text states: ""Ata mboka mokomoko ezalaki ya 'Scandinavie', ezalaki na bokeseni mingi na bato, bakonzi, bizaleli pe lisolo na kati Danemark, Suède, Norvège pe Islande. **Bikolo ya baEskimo bazalaki kofanda kuna na ntango wana.**""  (Even though the closest region isn't Scandinavia, it's a mix of people, organizations, businesses and located between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland. **Eskimo people have been living there since then.**)

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: BA Norvegien** (Norwegians): The text doesn't say Norwegians were the first to inhabit Greenland.
* **C: Erik the Red:** Erik the Red discovered Greenland and settled there, but the Eskimo people were already living there.
* **D: Ba Suedois** (Swedes):  The text doesn't mention Swedes.



"
Lisanga nini ekoki kolinga koliya ya kotelema kozanga bakiti te?,"The correct answer is **B: Mibali babola ya Roma**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bokeseni mosusu ezalaki ete babola na mwasi baliaki bilei na bango ntango bafandaki na bakiti..."" This translates to ""Moreover, it was that they would boil their grains with various meats when they went to the games...""  Therefore, the answer refers to the **meat** that the Romans boiled with their grains - the meats prepared by the Roman cooks (mibali babola ya Roma).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Basi ya bozui ya Roma** (Roman cooks): While cooks are involved, the passage specifically mentions the *meat* prepared by them, not just cooks in general.
*   **C: Mibali ya bozui ya Roma** (Roman cooks): Same reason as A.
*   **D: Basi ya babola ya Roma** (Roman bakers): The passage doesn't mention bakers. It focuses on meat being boiled with grains at the games.



"
Na Mae malandi nini ekoki kozala te kati ya feti ya Roma ya kala?,"The correct answer is **A: Bapaya babola koliya na bakiti** (They used slaves to grind grain).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bokeseni mosusu ezalaki ete babola na mwasi baliaki bilei na bango ntango bafandaki na bakiti..."" which translates to ""Furthermore, they used slaves to grind grain when they were occupied with warfare...""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Koliya bambembe pona apeti** (Eating monkeys for food): The text mentions eating wild boar, peacock, and deer, not monkeys.
* **C: Mibali ya bozui kolala nase na ngonga ya koliya** (Using wild animals to grind grain): The text mentions using slaves to grind grain.
* **D: Saani ya dendo yakotumba** (The sweat of the sun growing): This is irrelevant to the food preparation methods of ancient Rome.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini ekoki kozala na litomba ya molai te?","The correct answer is **A: Libota ya bato (Human intellect/thought)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that civilization is fundamentally about the collective intelligence and ability to cooperate of people. It mentions that civilizations are built on a shared understanding of complex things and that large groups of people working together can create sophisticated societies.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Libula ya mukie (Turtle shell):**  A turtle shell is a physical object and not directly related to the core definition of civilization.
* **C: Engumba ya munene (Large city):** While large cities are often a *result* of civilization, they are not the *definition* of it. A civilization can exist without a large city.
* **D: Libula oyo ezali civilizer (The intellect that civilizes):** This is a bit too specific and doesn't capture the broad concept of civilization as a societal development driven by collective intelligence and cooperation.

Therefore, the most accurate answer, according to the passage, is the collective **libota ya bato (human intellect/thought)**.  The passage implicitly states that civilization is a manifestation of human intellect working together.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini eyaka yambo ya ekolo?","The correct answer is **A: Libula oyo ezali civilizer**.

Here's why:

The passage describes civilization as a ""civilizer"" (civilis) in its etymology, meaning it's about cultivating and developing society.  The passage highlights how civilizations foster complex social structures, knowledge, and long-lasting impact. Option A best reflects this core concept.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Libula moko kaka (Only one language):** The passage mentions Latin, but civilization is not solely defined by a single language.
* **C: Engumba ya munene (Large city):** While large cities are often a feature of civilizations, they aren't the defining characteristic.
* **D: Libula ya mikie mike (Many small languages):** This is the opposite of what civilization entails; civilizations tend to have a unifying language or language family.



"
Maloba nini na mae matali The Drukgyal Dzong ezali ya solo te?,"The correct answer is **A: Etongamaki pona kosepela bolongi etumba ya mapinaga ya basoda ya Tibetan-Mongol** (It was built to suppress the invasions of Tibetan-Mongol armies).

Here's why:

* The provided text explicitly states: ""Na 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel atongaka ndako ya makasi mpona kokanisa ndenge balongaki basoda ya Tibetain-Mongol"" (In 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built it as a fortress to suppress the invasions of Tibetan-Mongol armies).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezuami na Bhutan** (It is in Bhutan): While true, this is a general fact about the Dzong and not the *reason* it was built.
* **C: Moto ebebisaki biloko ebele ya ndako** (Someone made many changes):  The text mentions someone damaging the Dzong, but it doesn't say they made *many* changes to its original construction.
* **D: Esalemaki na Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** (It was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel): While true, this doesn't explain the *purpose* of his building it. The purpose is given in the text as defense against invasions.



"
Maloba nini elimboli malamu litomba ya moto na Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Eloko moko kaka etikalaki ezali foto ya Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Na 1951, moto moko ezikisaki biloko mingi etikaki kaka mwa biloko moke na Drukgyal Dzong, na ndakisa foto ya Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel."" (In 1951, someone destroyed most of the contents of Drukgyal Dzong, and only a photo of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel remained.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mapinga ya basoda Tibetan-Mongol balongaki:** The text mentions the Dzong was built to counter Tibetan-Mongol invasions, but it doesn't say the *weapons* are symbolic of the destruction.
* **C: Koyebana mingi nabato ezalaki na mokakatano te:**  The text doesn't mention a large number of people in conflict.
* **D: Ebatelamaki na Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** The photo *is* of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, so this is false.



"
Na maloba malandi pona Mboka Cambodge nini ezali yasolo?,"The correct answer is **C: Cambodge ekotelamaki na makasi na mboka Vietnam na ebandeli ya ekeke 18**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the *cause* of Cambodia's vulnerability.** The provided text states that during the 18th century, Vietnam was expanding and conquered Cambodia. This conquest is a primary reason for Cambodia's later vulnerability.
* **Option A is incorrect:** While Vietnamese forces *did* capture Phnom Penh, the question asks for the *cause* of vulnerability, not just a specific event.
* **Option B is incorrect:**  The text mentions the relationship with Thailand in 1772 but it's not directly linked as the primary *cause* of vulnerability.
* **Option D is incorrect:**  The text states Thai forces attacked Phnom Penh, not Vietnamese forces.



"
Na maloba malandi maloba nini elimboli malamu Bokoti na makasi na mboka Cambodge?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Thailandais mpe ba Vietnamiens bakotaki na Cambodge na mbula 1772**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""Bato ya Thaïlande bakotaki na makasi na Cambodge mbala mingi na ekeke ya 18 mpe na mobu 1772, babomaki Phnom Phen. Na bambula ya suka ya ekeke ya 18 Vietnam ekendaki kobundisa mpe Cambodge.""  This directly links Thailand and Vietnam's involvement in Cambodia during 1772 and the subsequent Vietnamese influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba Vietnamiens bakotaki na makasi na Cambodge mbala ebele:** While true, the passage specifically mentions the conflict of 1772 and the later Vietnamese influence spurred by that conflict.  Option B is more specific and directly supported by the text.
* **C: Ba vietnamien babebisaki Phnom Phen:** This is partially true (Vietnamese forces did capture Phnom Penh), but it doesn't capture the broader context of both Thailand and Vietnam's interactions.
* **D: Ba Thailandais bakotaki na makasi na Cambodge mbala ebele:** While also true, the option doesn't mention the crucial timeframe of 1772 and the subsequent Vietnamese involvement that significantly shaped Cambodia's history.



"
Entreprise ya Inde Dutch Est esalaki nini te na tango nabango na Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **B: Mosala ya misala ya kobongola bambuma (Slave trade)**.

The text states: ""...bazalaki kosalela bato ya Chine lokola bato ya mosala mpona kosala na bilanga ya loso mpe ya sukali."" which translates to ""...they were selling Chinese people as slaves to work in sugar cane and tobacco plantations.""
"
Boyokani ya Shimonoseki esalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Kibonkozi ya Japon likolo na Taiwan**.

The text states: ""Na 1895, ntango bato ya Chine na bato ya Japon babelaki na mbala ya liboso na bitumba (1894-1895), boyangeli ya Qing esalaki boyokani na Shimonoseki, bandimaki kopesa boyangeli ya Taiwan na maboko ya Japon, oyo eyangelaki esanga wana kino 1945.""

This translates to: ""In 1895, when the Chinese and Japanese fought a war (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding the territory of Taiwan to Japan, which remained under Japanese rule until 1945.""

Therefore, the Treaty of Shimonoseki resulted in Japan gaining control of Taiwan.
"
Nivo ya pH ya Chimi etalemaka lolenge nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Lolenge nini acid ezali pete to chimic**.

Here's why:

* **pH** is a scale used to measure the acidity or basicity of a solution. 
    * A low pH (below 7) indicates an acidic solution.
    * A high pH (above 7) indicates a basic (alkaline) solution.
    * A pH of 7 is neutral.

The text states that orange juice is acidic because it contains a lot of acid. Therefore, pH indicates *how acidic* a chemical is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baprotons boni ezali na kati ya Chimi** - While protons (H+) are involved in pH, the pH scale itself doesn't directly indicate the presence of protons. It indicates their *concentration*.
* **C: Ba Hydrogenes boni ezali kati na ba ions chimique** -  Hydrogens are part of hydrogen ions (H+), but the pH scale isn't *about* the presence of hydrogen ions; it's about their concentration.
* **D: Baelectrons boni ezali na kati ya chimie** - Electrons are involved in chemical bonding, but the pH scale measures acidity/basicity, not electron presence.
"
Nini elongolamaki na kati ya baions Hydrogene?,"The correct answer is **A: BaProtons**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Balakisi nivo ya pH na motango ya baions ya hydrogène (H na pH) na eloko ya chimie oyo bamekaki. Baions ya hydrogène eza baprotons oyo balongola baélectrons...""

This directly links hydrogen ions (H+) to protons.  Therefore, hydrogen ions *are* protons.
"
Maloba nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu te Lolendo ya Nkosi?,"The correct answer is **B: Botangi ya mibali na ya basi ekokani te**.

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where the women and men in the bank are very upset and often argue about the needs of the children. This suggests a lack of understanding and cooperation between the men and women regarding the bank's operation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazalaka na bizaleli ndenge moko na etuluku ya bambwa** (They have only one way of doing things in the bank's operation) - The text doesn't explicitly say this. It focuses on their arguments, not necessarily a rigid, single approach.
* **C: Mibali na basi bango nyonso bayokanaka malamu** (All the women and men understand each other well) - The text *directly contradicts* this. It states they often argue and have different priorities.
* **D: Bango nyonso bakoki koboma mpe bayebi kofanda na basusu** (They all can work and understand how to manage) - While they *can* work, the text indicates a lack of understanding *how to manage* due to the constant disagreements and competing priorities.



"
Na mae malandi maloba nini elimboli malamu te ezaleli ya bankosi?,"The correct answer is **D: Bazali na bizaleli ekokana na baniau ya minene misusu** (They have a relationship with very young animals).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Bankosi basalaka makambo neti bambwa ya zamba, banyama ekokona na ndenge ya kokamwa na bankosi (kasi te na baniau mosusu ya minene) na bizalelei na bango..."" (Bankosi do things like dogs, animals can befriend bankosi (but not very young animals) and they have relationships with them...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bayebi kofanda na basusu malamu** (They are good at understanding animals): While they understand animals to some degree, the text focuses on the relationships and specific interactions, not just general understanding.
* **B: Bizaleli na bango ekokani na ya ba mbwa ya zamba** (Their relationship with them is like that of dogs with wolves): The text compares them to dogs, but the core of the relationship is with very young animals.
* **C: Bango nyonso mibali na basi bakoki koboma makasi pona koluka bilei** (All of them, adults and children, can work hard to achieve a common goal): The text mentions both adults and children, and collaboration, but doesn't highlight this as a defining characteristic *not* of the bankosi.



"
Balapins balukamaka lokola bilei mbala ebele pona nani?,"The correct answer is **B: Baniau ya minene**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes how **small insects** (baniau ya mwa moene) are attracted to things that are decaying or have a lot of organic matter. This includes things like rotting food, insects, and decaying plants.  Therefore, the question is asking which type of insect would be attracted to this type of environment, and the text explicitly states the attraction is to **small insects**. The term ""baniau ya minene"" translates to ""small insects"".



"
Baniau ya mike mikie mbala ebele elukaka bilei nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Barongeurs**.

The text states: ""...eza na baniau mingi ya mike (ata baniau oyo babokolaka) oyo eliaka biloko mingi ya mike, na ndakisa bafourmis, **barongeurs**, miselekete, mpe bandeke.""  This translates to ""...there are many (even those that are not) with many things, and are mixed with ants, **termites**, cockroaches, and beetles."" Therefore, termites (barongeurs) are mentioned as one of the insects that often appear in large numbers.



"
Na Mae malandi nini ezali te na bizaleli ya BaOcelot na lolenge naye yakoluka bilei?,"The correct answer is **C: Kolanda banyama oyo bazali kolanda na butu.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bato ya siansi bakanisaka ete baocelots balandaka pe bakangaka banyama ya kolia (mbisi) na solo, babendaka zolo mpona koyeba esika bazalaki na mabele.""  This translates to: ""Scientists believe that ocelots also hunt (fish) on land, they dig holes to find out where they are in the forest.""

The key phrase is ""kolanda banyama oyo bazali kolanda na butu"" which means ""hunt animals that are hunting on land"". The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Kobima libanda ya esika nabango ya kobatama** (Marking the location where they are hunting): While ocelots might mark territory, the text doesn't directly state this is a primary reason for their hunting success.
*   **B: Kolanda solo ya nyama oyo bazali kolanda** (Hunting the flesh of the animals they hunt):  The text focuses on the hunting *method* (digging holes) rather than the consumption of the prey.
*   **D: Balandaka kaka banyama ya mikie** (They only hunt small animals): The text states they hunt *fish* and *other animals*, not just small ones.



"
Na mae malandi nini elimboli Ocelot malamu te? ,"The correct answer is **A: Bakoki koluka bilei malamu mingi na butu (They can climb very high with agility).**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Bakoki komona malamu mpenza na molili mpo bamonaka na butu"" which translates to ""They can see very well from above to watch for prey"".  This is directly linked to their ability to climb and observe.
* Option A reflects this ability.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * B: ""Batambolaka nokinoki"" (They walk everywhere) is not mentioned in the text.
    * C: ""Makoki nabango ya koyoka solo ezali nase"" (Their ability to climb trees is the same) is incorrect because the text emphasizes their *agility* in climbing.
    * D: ""Balingaka koluka banyama ya mikie"" (They hunt large animals) is false; the text says they hunt animals of *various sizes*.



"
Na mae malandi nini ekoki te kozala eloko ya makasi koleka na bizaleli ya Tigre?,"The correct answer is **A: Koganga (To get sick)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the tiger is already a powerful athlete and possesses other strengths. The question asks what *could* limit its strength.  

* **Koganga (To get sick)** directly impacts physical ability and power.  If a tiger is sick, its athletic abilities would be significantly diminished.
* **Komata na esika (To be in a location)** doesn't inherently limit strength.
* **Kopumbwa noki (To be trapped)** could limit *action*, but not necessarily innate strength.
* **Kobenda (To rest)** is necessary for any athlete, but it doesn't inherently limit their strength *capacity*.

Therefore, getting sick is the most likely factor to limit a tiger's physical prowess.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bokeseni ya Tigre na Nkosi ezali nini na mae malandi?","The correct answer is **A: Makoki nabango ya kobeta mai**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Lokola aza athlète ya malamu mpenza, tigre akoki komata (kasi malamu te)..."" which translates to ""Like a very agile athlete, the tiger can pounce (but not easily)..."".  The text then later describes the tiger's roar as different from a lion's roar, focusing on its ability to make a loud, piercing sound.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mongongo ya kolela nabango** (The superiority of lions over them) - The text doesn't compare the intelligence of tigers and lions.
* **C: Makoki nabango ya kopumbwa** (Their ability to be captured) - The text focuses on the tiger's strength and agility, not its vulnerability.
* **D: Makasi nabango pona kobenda** (Their power to be feared) - While tigers are powerful, the text doesn't directly compare their ability to instill fear to lions.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is that tigers share the ability to pounce with lions.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Robert Hooke asalaki nini yambo ya baBiologists misusu?","The correct answer is **C: Kotala biloko ya mikie mikie**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Hooke observed ""ba carrés ya mike"" (small squares) under the microscope that reminded him of small rooms (""bachambre"").
* It also mentions these squares were made up of ""biloko ya mike-mike"" (very small things).
* This discovery of the fundamental building blocks of life, which he named ""cells,"" was a groundbreaking observation of microscopic structures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kotala baselile yakokufa (Seeing dead cells):** While Hooke observed dead cells, the significance was not just seeing dead cells, but recognizing the fundamental unit of living things.
* **B: Kosalela microscope ponakomona ba enama (Using a microscope to see animals):**  While Hooke used a microscope, the text doesn't say he primarily observed animals. His initial discovery was about the basic structure of matter.
* **D: Amonaki moto ya liboso balisanga ya mukie makasi ya eloko (Seeing a simple person who organized very small things):** This is not supported by the text. Hooke's observation wasn't about a person, but about the structure of matter.



"
Ebandeli ya Kombo “cell” to selile elobi nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Chambre ya mukie (Chamber of a small room)**.

The text states: ""Selile euta na liloba ya Kilatini cella oyo elimboli chambre ya moke."" This translates to ""Cell derives from the Latin word cella which means small room."" Therefore, a cell is essentially a small room.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, banyama mingi bazali na makoki ya kosala nini?","The correct answer is **D: Kotimola**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Batimolaka mabele, batambolaka na bambu, pe bapumbwaka likolo.""  This translates to ""They swim in water, they walk on bamboo, and they crawl on sand.""  ""Kotimola"" means to swim.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kopumbwa (To be caught):** The text doesn't mention being caught.
* **B: Kolongwa esika to kotambola (To fly or walk):** While some animals fly or walk, the text specifically mentions swimming and walking on bamboo.
* **C: Kobeta mai (To eat well):** The text doesn't discuss eating habits.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, banyama misusu bazangaka eloko nini?","The correct answer is **A: Selile**.

Here's why:

The first sentence of the text states: ""Banyama ezalaka na baselile mingi."" This translates to ""Animals are very agile.""  The question asks what animals do as a result of being agile.  The text then describes many actions related to agility like jumping, swimming, climbing, and hunting.  ""Selile"" (agile) is the core characteristic highlighted in the initial statement, making it the best answer.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Makoki ya koliya lisusu biloko na kati ya libumu (Ability to learn more things within the book):** While the text *describes* animals, it doesn't imply an ability to learn more from the book itself.
*   **C: Boongo (Goodness):** The text mentions some animals have venom, but it's not a defining characteristic of *all* animals, and isn't directly linked to their agility.
*   **D: Makoki ya koliya (Ability to jump):** While jumping is mentioned, agility encompasses more than just jumping. It's a broader term.

Nini esungaka banzete na tango ya Photosynthesis?,"The correct answer is **A: Esika ya Malili (Carbon Dioxide)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Banzete esalaka bilei na yango na moi na nzela ya ebongiseli babengi photosynthese."" This translates to ""Carbon dioxide is used in the process by which plants perform photosynthesis.""

Therefore, carbon dioxide (banzete) is a key ingredient in photosynthesis.
"
Eloko nini bato babimisaka oyo banzete ezuaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbone dioxide**.

The text states: ""Banzete esalaka esalaka mopepe oyo bato bapemaka, pe ezwaka dioxide ya carbone oyo bato babimisaka (elingi koloba kofula)."" which translates to ""The greenhouse effect is caused by the gases that people emit, and carbon dioxide that people burn (meaning fuel).""
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, ndakisa nini na kati ya mae malandi ekoki kopekisa evolution?","The correct answer is **C: Population komeka koyeba lolenge ya kobika na esika naye ya sika.**

Here's why:

The text explains that species evolve when a population *learns* how to thrive in its specific environment. This adaptation to a particular habitat is the driving force behind speciation.  Options A and B describe movement, not adaptation. Option D, while sometimes part of evolution, isn't the core mechanism described in the text regarding speciation.  The text emphasizes the population's ability to *adapt* and *learn* to stay in its niche.



"
Na mae malandi maloba nini elimboli eteni ya speciation malamu te ? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ezali eteni ya motuya mingi na evolution (It is a major driving force of evolution)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Spéciation eza mbano oyo ebimaka ntango nyonso mpe eza eteni ya ntina mingi ya évolution."" which translates to ""Speciation is a process that happens all the time and is a major driving force of evolution.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ekomaka tango population ya sika ekoki te koyekola kofanda na esika (It happens when a population cannot move to a new location):** While geographic isolation *can* lead to speciation, it's not the *definition* of speciation. The passage defines speciation in a broader context.
* **C: Ezali kolobela bosali ya bikelamu ya sika (It is the explanation of the diversity of species):** Speciation *results* in the diversity of species, but it's not the explanation *of* the diversity itself. The passage indicates speciation *creates* the diversity.
* **D: Bozalisi na yango ekoki kopekisama te (It cannot be tested):** Speciation *is* testable through scientific observation and analysis of populations and their genetic makeup.



"
Eteni nini ya system ya circulation oyo ememaka makila na motema?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba arteres (Arteries)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Makila eutaka na motema na batiyo babengi ba artères pe ezongaka na motema na batiyo babengi ba veines."" This translates to: ""Blood flows with great force in vessels called arteries and slowly in vessels called veins.""  Therefore, arteries are the vessels where blood flows with the most force (meaning fastest/most powerfully).



Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba Capillaires (Capillaries):** Capillaries are mentioned as small vessels, but the passage says blood flows *slowly* through them.
* **C: Ba Enama (Veins):** The passage indicates blood flows *slowly* in veins.
* **D: Misisa (Heart):** The heart *pumps* the blood, but the question asks *where* the blood flows with great force. The arteries are the vessels where that forceful flow occurs.



"
Batiyo nini ezalaka ya mukie makasi na system ya circulation?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba Capillaires**.

Here's why:

* **Capillaries** are the smallest blood vessels and form a vast network throughout the body. This large surface area is crucial for efficient exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and the body's tissues.  This exchange is the primary function of the circulatory system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Arteries:** Carry blood *away* from the heart.
* **Veins:** Carry blood *back* to the heart.
* **Heart:** The pump that drives the circulatory system, but not a vessel.



"
Makoki ya nyama ya mukie emataka na lolenge nini pona kokanga mapapu naye kozongisa sima?,"The correct answer is **C: Kozua balingami (Having a strong will/determination)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that elephants are intelligent and capable of remembering locations where they find food. It also mentions they have a strong tendency to cooperate and that they are sadly often captured for their ivory. The key to their ability to resist capture (and thus not cooperate with poachers) lies in their inherent strength of will and determination to survive.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kozua bilei ebele (Having a lot of size/strength):** While elephants are strong, the passage focuses more on their intelligence and willpower than sheer physical power as a defense mechanism against capture.
*   **B: Bisika ya kobatama (Having a habitat/territory):** While habitat is important for survival, it doesn't directly address the elephant's ability to resist capture.
*   **D: Vitesi ya kobunda (Speed of fleeing):** Elephants are not particularly fast, so speed is not their main defense mechanism.

Therefore, **C: Kozua balingami (Having a strong will/determination)** best captures the essence of why elephants are able to resist poachers despite their vulnerability."
Na mae matali makoki ya banyama ya mikie kopunmbwa nini epatami te na mae malandi oyo ekoki kozala affecter na makoki ya nyama ya mukie kopunbwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Molai ya bomoi (Habitat)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that animals that cannot reproduce when captured often become endangered, like the dragon and ephemeral.  This implies that their survival depends on specific conditions.  The question asks what *prevents* animals from reproducing when captured.  

A key factor preventing reproduction in captured animals is often linked to the **habitat** they are removed from.  Captivity often lacks the suitable environment, social structure, or breeding conditions necessary for them to reproduce successfully. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kobotama (Feeding):** While proper feeding is important, it doesn't directly address the fundamental biological needs required for reproduction – a suitable environment and social cues.
* **C: Kokutanisa bilei (Interaction/Socialization):**  Social structures are crucial for some species' reproduction, but the lack of a suitable habitat is a more primary and often insurmountable obstacle in captivity.
* **D: Kosala musala malamu (Gentle handling):** While gentle handling is important for minimizing stress, it doesn't inherently solve the reproductive challenges posed by a foreign environment.



Therefore, **Molai ya bomoi (Habitat)** is the most direct and encompassing answer to the question.



"
Ezaleli nini na mae malandi oyo elandanaka te na BaDinosore?,"The correct answer is **D: Makolo na manzaka**.

The text states that dinosaurs lived in a time with ""makolo oyo eza na baposo mpe manzaka"" (a time with volcanoes and earthquakes). This is presented as a reason why dinosaurs might have died out. The other options are mentioned as behaviors of dinosaurs, not factors related to their extinction.
"
Na mae malandi ezaleli nini oyo ekokani te kati ya bandeke na baDinosore?,"The correct answer is **D: Makolo na manzaka (Scaly skin)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Baza na makolo oyo eza na baposo mpe manzaka..."" which translates to ""They have skin covered in scales and scaly skin..."".  This is a key characteristic of dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kobwaka maki (Hunting in packs):** While some dinosaurs may have hunted in groups, the passage doesn't specifically mention this as a defining characteristic *that separates them*.
* **B: Kosalela makolo mibale ya sima pona kotambola (Having a long neck for feeding):**  Not all dinosaurs had long necks. The passage mentions dinosaurs with scaly skin and a variety of other features, not just long necks.
* **C: Makoki ya kopumbwa (Ability to be hunted):**  All living things can be hunted, so this isn't a differentiating characteristic of dinosaurs in comparison to other animals.



"
"Kolanada maloba wana, eteni nini ya nzete ya Cycas oyo Triceratops akoki koliya?","The correct answer is **B: Nzete**.

The text states: ""Bato mosusu ya siansi bakaniska ete Triceratops aliaki ba cycas, oyo eza lolenge ya nzete moko oyo ezalaki mingi na Crétacé.""  This translates to ""Many scientists believe that Triceratops ate cycads, which is the source of a plant that was abundant in the Cretaceous period.""

Therefore, Triceratops ate **cycads**, which are a type of **plant** (nzete in the text).
"
"Kolanda maloba wana,Triceratops akoki koliya nini na mae malandi? ","The correct answer is **D: Nzete ya bambuma ya ngenge**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bato ya siansi balobaka ete banzete wana ezalaka na ngenge makasi, yango wana likoki eza te ete dinosaure nde esangisaki bango, atako lelo nyama babengi goigoi mpe banyama mosusu na ndakisa tiaku (oyo eza mwana ya ba dinosaures) bakoki kolia matiti to bambuma eza na ngenge.""

This translates to: ""Scientists believe these plants were very tall, which is why it's unlikely dinosaurs fed them, but now we see goats and many other animals with short legs (which are descendants of dinosaurs) can eat leaves from tall trees.""

Therefore, the Triceratops, being a descendant of dinosaurs with shorter legs, would have likely eaten **tall, leafy plants (nzete ya bambuma ya ngenge)**.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pareseau (Sloth):** Sloths eat leaves, but the text focuses on the *height* of the plants.
*   **B: Nzete ya mitape makasi (Very tough plants):** The text indicates the plants were tall, not necessarily tough.
*   **C: Tiaku (Goats):**  While goats eat leaves, the text points out that Goats and many other animals can eat plants with short legs."
"Kolanda maloba wana, na ba Sports elandi sport nini ekoki kozala ya koyebana makasi na biteni ya nordi ya Mboka Itali?","The correct answer is **C: Snowboarding**.

Here's why:

* The question asks for a sport that is closely related to the Nordic mountains of Italy.
* Snowboarding is a winter sport performed on snow, which is directly associated with mountains and Nordic environments.
* While skiing (which is implied by ""biteni ya nordi"") is also a possibility, snowboarding is a more direct and closely related sport within that category.
* The other options are less related:
    * **Ndembo (Football/Soccer):**  While popular, it's not specific to mountainous regions.
    * **Voleybal (Volleyball):**  Played on a court, not directly linked to Nordic landscapes.
    * **Course ya Moto F1 (Formula 1 Racing):**  A motorsport and not a sport related to the Nordic environment.



"
"Kolanda bansango epesami na maloba wana, Sport nini na mae malandi elongaki World Championship pona Mboka Itali","The correct answer is **A: Ndembo (Football/Soccer)**.

The text explicitly states that the Italian national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 2006. While other sports are mentioned as popular in Italy, football is the only one directly linked to a World Cup victory.
"
Biteni misusu ya Luxembourg ekomaki Belgique sima ya likambo nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Botomboki ya Belgique**.

The passage clearly states: ""Luxembourg eza na lisolo ya kala kasi ezwaki lipanda na 1839. Biteni ya Belgique ya lelo ezalaki naino na Luxembourg na kala kasi ekoma ya Belgique nsima ya botomboki ya Belgique ya mibu 1830.""

This translates to: ""Luxembourg is in a small area but was founded in 1839. The territory of present-day Belgium was also in Luxembourg but became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.""
"
Na mae malandi nini epekisaki Luxembourg kozala na katikati?,"The correct answer is **B: Kokota Boyokani Union Europeene** (Joining the European Economic Community).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Na 1957, Luxembourg ekomaki na kati ya mikili oyo esalaki lisanga oyo eyebana lelo na nkombo ya Union européenne."" (In 1957, Luxembourg became part of the group that is now the European Union.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alemagne kokota na makasi** (Germany's strong influence): While Germany *did* exert influence, the text doesn't say this directly *caused* Luxembourg to become central.
* **C: Botomboki ya Belgique** (Belgian Revolution): The Belgian Revolution led to Luxembourg's incorporation into Belgium, but it doesn't explain its later importance.
* **D: Kozala Mboka ya komitalela yango moko** (Being a center of trade alone): The text states Luxembourg wasn't a major trading center until later, and the EU membership is the key point.



"
Kilometre carrer boni ya mboka Turquie ezali na Erope?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage states: ""755 688 kilomètres carrés (291 773 miles carrés) eza na Asie ya sudi weste mpe 23 764 kilomètres carrés (9174 miles carrés) na Eropa.""  This means that 23,764 square kilometers of Turkey are located in Europe.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kimolai ya Turquie ezali boni?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The question asks for the length of Turkey's territory, and the text states: ""Teritware ya Turquie eza molai bakilometele koleka 1 600 (1 000 mi) pe 800 km (500 mi) na monene..."" which translates to ""The territory of Turkey is approximately 1600 kilometers (1000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide...""
"
Lokota ya Latin esalemaka pona nini na Engumba Vatican?,"The correct answer is **A: Makambo ya Nzambe (Things of God)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lokota ya Italie eza mpe lokota ya mikolo nyonso oyo elobamaka na bato mingi oyo basalaka misala ya Leta kasi basalelaka Latin mbala mingi na makambo ya Nzambe."" (The Italian language is also the language of all those who practice the affairs of the State, but they use Latin often for things of God.)
"
"Na Engumba Vatican, lokota ya Itali esalemaka te pona ntina nini?","The correct answer is **C: Makambo ya Nzambe** (Things of God).

The passage states: ""Lokota ya Italie eza mpe lokota ya mikolo nyonso oyo elobamaka na bato mingi oyo basalaka misala ya Leta kasi basalelaka Latin mbala mingi na makambo ya Nzambe."" This translates to: ""The Italian language is also the language of all those who practice state affairs, but they use Latin often for things of God.""

Therefore, the Italian language is used for religious matters within the Vatican.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kouta na bosangisi ya mingongo na ba ordinatere ya mindondomindondo nini ekoki kozua litomba?","The correct answer is **A: Miziki (Music)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mbala mingi basalaka enregistrement ya miziki na nzela ya ba ordinatere ya mindondomindondo mpona kobongisa mpe kosangisa mingongo"" which translates to ""Often they record music using desktop computers to edit and mix it.""

While computers *can* be used for animations, photos, and video editing, the passage specifically mentions music recording and editing. Therefore, music is the most direct and accurate answer based on the text.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, ebeleya bandako ya esika nini emonanaki kozala na ba toilete ya mindele?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage explicitly states that the sanitation systems in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro are examples of early sanitation, and that they are comparable to those found in Minoan Crete and Santorini, as well as Egypt, Persia, and ancient China. However, the question asks where it is *most* prominently observed. The passage focuses heavily on Mohenjo-daro as a prime example of sophisticated sanitation.
"
Na Bisika elandi esika nini bipai ya malamu ya kobwaka mai ya mbindo emonanaki?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bingumba ya Harappa pe Mohenjo-daro ezalaki na bawese basalelaka mai mpona kolekisa mbindo na bandako na bango mingi mpenza..."" (The temples of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had priests who performed rituals to purify the water...).  While other locations are mentioned, Harappa is the first and primary location cited in connection with this practice.
"
Na mae malandi nini esalaka patineur kobaluka?,"The correct answer is **B: Basonge mibale na Razwar ya patineur**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the problem comes from the ice being uneven (""basonge mibale na libulu na kati na yango"") and the rollerblades being unstable (""razware ezalaka ya kobaluka mwa moke""). 
* The uneven ice combined with the instability of the rollerblades is what causes the skater to lose balance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Suka ya Songe ya Razwar ya patineur** (The type of rollerblade wheel): While the wheels contribute to instability, the core problem isn't *just* the type of wheel. It's the combination of uneven ice and the wheels' effect on that.
* **C: Mayele mpe boyebi nyonso ya patineur** (Skill and overall understanding of the skater): The text doesn't suggest a lack of skill is the main issue. It focuses on the physical environment and equipment.
* **D: Glace ya malamu** (Soft ice): The text mentions ""glace malamu"" (soft ice) but it's a consequence of the unevenness. The underlying issue is the uneven ice itself, not simply the softness.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu libulu na kati ya razwar ya patin ya mikolo oyo?","The correct answer is **B: Esika ya kobaluka**.

Here's why:

The passage states the following: ""Basonge nyonso mibale esalisaka na kozwa glace malamu, ata soki etengami. Po se ya razware ezalaka ya kobaluka mwa moke..."" which translates to: ""All the wooden blocks are made to create soft ice, even if it's not frozen. But when the ice melts, it melts very easily...""

The passage then describes how the melting ice causes the skater to lose balance. Therefore, the ""esika ya kobaluka"" (the place/reason for losing balance) is the melting ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Basonge mibale (Wooden blocks):** While the wooden blocks are *used* to make the ice, they aren't the *reason* the skater loses balance.
* **C: Esika ya kokutana (The place of meeting):** This makes no sense in the context of the passage.
* **D: Kotengama (Freezing):** Freezing is the process of making the ice, not the cause of the skater losing balance.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini esalaka ete Ba Atomes elongola nguya ya koleka ebele na mwinda?","The correct answer is **B: kolendisa mpona kobimisa baphotons**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Basalaka yango na kobimisaka mwa ndambu ya pole babengi """"photon"""". Bato ya siansi babengaka metode wana """"kolendisa mpona kobimisa kongenga"""" po bapesaki atome moto na nzela ya pole makasi, esalaka ete ebimisisa pole ya photon...""

This directly links the process of ""kolendisa mpona kobimisa kongenga"" (using to emit to stimulate) photons. The passage describes how atoms emit photons, which is a form of radiation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Radiation:** While the passage mentions radiation as a result of photon emission, it doesn't directly state that radiation *causes* atoms to emit more photons.  The process of stimulating photons is the mechanism.
*   **C: Baphotons:** Photons are the result of the process, not the cause of atoms emitting more of them.
*   **D: kolendisa mpona kobimisa radiation:** This is too broad. The specific process described is stimulating photons.



Therefore, the passage explains that atoms emit a large number of photons through a process of stimulated emission of photons."
Nini etindaka atome kobimisa photon?,"The correct answer is **B: Kolendisa oyo etindamaka na mwinda ya makasi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Basalaka yango na kobimisaka mwa ndambu ya pole babengi """"photon"""". Bato ya siansi babengaka metode wana """"kolendisa mpona kobimisa kongenga"""" po bapesaki atome moto na nzela ya pole makasi, esalaka ete ebimisisa pole ya photon, pe pole eza lolenge moko ya kongenga.""

This translates to: ""They convert it to be absorbed by the surface, they call it 'photon'. Scientists call this method 'converting to enable energy absorption' and they have made people move very quickly through the surface, it causes the surface to emit photons, and the surface is the only way energy is released.""

The key phrase is ""kolendisa mpona kobimisa kongenga,"" which means ""converting to enable energy absorption."" This describes the process of using a surface to absorb energy and emit photons. This is essentially converting the energy into photons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kobima nguya ya koleka** (Absorbing old energy): While absorbing energy is part of the process, it doesn't fully explain *what* allows the atoms to emit photons.
*   **C: Nguya oyo ezali stable te** (Energy that is not stable): The passage doesn't discuss the stability of the energy.
*   **D: Ezaleli pona kobundisa Kongenga** (It's difficult to break up energy):  The passage says it's a way to *release* energy, not break it up.

Therefore, option B is the only one that accurately reflects the process described in the passage.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kopekisa ampule kosala?","The correct answer is **C: Nsinga ya kati ya Ampule kozika (The filament inside the bulb is broken)**.

Here's why:

The problem description states the bulb keeps burning out, and the typical troubleshooting involves checking the bulb itself (filament) and the electrical connection.  Option C directly addresses the most common cause of a bulb burning out repeatedly – a broken filament.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Biloko ya mwinda kobomana malamu te (The switch is not closing properly):** While a faulty switch *can* cause problems, it's less likely to be the *repeated* burning out described. It would usually result in the bulb not lighting at all.
* **B: Kotiya eteni ya libende ya ampule na soket malamu te (The bulb's base is not tightly connected to the socket):** A loose connection could cause intermittent problems, but not usually repeated burnout.  It might cause a short circuit.
* **D: Kotambola ya courant na kati ya soket kozala malembe (There's a constant flow of current in the socket):**  A constant flow of current would likely trip a breaker or blow a fuse, not just burn out the bulb. It would also be a serious electrical hazard.



"
Na mae malandi nini ekoki kozala likama makasi?,"The correct answer is **D: Nsinga ya munene to cable (The power cord or cable)**.

Here's why:

The question describes a situation where the light bulb doesn't work and the problem might be with the power source (either the cord or the cable).  The passage explicitly states that electricity flowing to the bulb can cause a dangerous situation if there's a short circuit.  A damaged cord or cable is a common cause of such a short circuit.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Nsinga (The socket):** While a faulty socket *can* cause problems, the text focuses on the potential for short circuits related to the power *to* the bulb, pointing more strongly towards the cord/cable.
* **B: Esika ya kopelisa mwinda (The connection point of the cord):**  This is possible, but the power cord itself is a more likely source of a problem that could lead to a dangerous short circuit.
* **C: Eteni yase ya Ampule (The base of the light bulb):** Problems with the bulb's base are more likely to simply prevent the bulb from working, not necessarily cause a dangerous short circuit in the electrical wiring.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini esalemaka tango neutron ekabwani?","The correct answer is **D: Baneutrons ebungaka** (Neutrons are released).

Here's why:

The question asks what happens when a neutron is captured during a fission reaction.  During fission, when a neutron strikes a fissile nucleus (like Uranium-235), the nucleus splits.  A key part of this process is that **multiple neutrons are released** in the splitting process.  These released neutrons then go on to cause further fission events, creating a chain reaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baprotons ezuamaka** (Protons are released): While protons are part of the nucleus, the primary release is of neutrons.
*   **B: Nguya ebimaka** (Energy is released):  Yes, energy is released, but this isn't what *directly* happens to the neutron. The neutron is released, and *then* energy is released as a result.
*   **C: BaAtomes ekomaka bisika nyonso** (Atoms move everywhere): Atoms do move, but it's not the primary effect of the neutron being captured. The splitting of the nucleus is the main event.



"
Na mae malandi nini elimboli malamu kobenga moto na mosika kozonga nase?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Satellites**.

Here's why:

The passage describes launching satellites into space. The observation of a ""malamu"" (something unusual/a signal) is directly linked to satellites orbiting the Earth.  The question asks what could cause a signal to be observed in space, and the passage heavily focuses on satellites as the method of observation and the source of the signal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Telescopes:** Telescopes are used *to observe* things like satellites, but they don't *cause* the signal to be there.
* **C: Minda (Fields):** Fields are irrelevant to the context of space observation.
* **D: Ba Rockets:** Rockets are used to *launch* satellites and telescopes, not to generate the signal itself. They are a means to an end, not the cause of the observed anomaly.



"
Na biloko oyo elandi nini baselalaka pona kotinda telescope na mapata?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Rockets**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Batindaki satelite na likolo na nzela ya rocket."" (They launch satellites into space using rockets.)  Since a telescope is being launched to space, it would also be launched using a rocket.
"
Nini esengeli koyebana na makambo oyo esalemaka mbala na mbala pona koyeba lolenge tango ezali kokende?,"The correct answer is **B: Repetition**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Okoki kotia yo moko bilembo na ndenge ntango ezoleka na kotanga ba repetition ya likambo moko oyo ezongaka."" (You can try to identify it by looking for the repetition of one thing that is being repeated.)

Therefore, **repetition** (Repetition) is the key to understanding how time moves.  The passage connects the repeating action (the ""likambo oyo ezongaka"") to the concept of time's flow.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bowumeli (Perspective/Point of View):** While perspective can influence how we *perceive* time, it's not the fundamental mechanism described in the passage for understanding *how* time moves.
*   **C: Effet (Effect):**  The effect of something is a result, not the cause of the repetitive nature of time.
*   **D: Mokakatano (Contradiction):** Contradiction is a logical inconsistency and doesn't relate to the concept of time's flow as described."
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya likambo esalemaka pona kokokisa tango?","The correct answer is **B: Repetition**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that the phenomenon being discussed is characterized by repeated patterns (""repetition of the same thing"").  The text explicitly states ""ntango ezoleka banda na mikolo eza oyo koleka na lelo pe na ntango ya kala"" (it extends into the future) and links it to ""likambo oyo esalemaka mbala na mbala"" (the thing that is done repeatedly). 

* **Repetition** directly addresses the core idea of repeated patterns.
* **Kimolai** (meaning ""intention"" or ""purpose"") isn't the primary focus.
* **Experience** is a broader concept, not specifically about the repeating patterns.
* **Effet** (meaning ""effect"") refers to a result, not the process of repetition itself.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ekokani na lolenge ya mokitani ya kiti ya kibokonzi","The correct answer is **C: Kotanga Makambo ya kala**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Charles studied anthropology and archaeology, focusing on ""makambo ya kala"" (ancient things/things of the past).
* The question asks what relates to the king's obsession with soda. The passage implies that Charles's fascination with the past somehow connects to the king's unusual habit.
* The other options are not directly supported by the text:
    * **A: Kozua diplome ya Universite na 2.2** - While Charles has a degree, the specific grade is not directly relevant to the king's soda habit.
    * **B: Koboya kokende na Universite pona kokende na Musala ya soda** -  The text suggests he studied *anthropology and archaeology*, not soda studies.
    * **D: Kokende na Universite liboso ya kokende na mosala ya kisoda** - This is inaccurate; the text indicates he studied other fields.



Therefore, the connection is his interest in ancient things/history (""makambo ya kala""), which is the most logical link to the unusual behavior described."
"Kolanda bansango epesami na maloba wana, Charles azalaki moto ya yambo kosala nini?","The correct answer is **C: Kozua Diplome**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Charles azalaki moto ya liboso ya libota ya bokonzi ya Grande Bretagne azwaki diplome."" This directly translates to ""Charles is a well-known scholar of British history who holds a diploma.""  The key word here is ""diplome"" (diploma).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kokende mosala ya kisoda liboso ya kosilisa kelasi** (Going to drink soda every day to study): This is mentioned in the first sentence about the speaker but has nothing to do with Charles.
* **B: Kotanga Archeolohgie** (Studying Archaeology): While Charles studies archaeology, the sentence focuses on him *having* a diploma in a field, not just studying it.
* **D: Akotaki na Universite ya Trinity College** (Attending Trinity College): The passage mentions Charles attends Trinity College, but the emphasis is on him *possessing* a diploma.



Therefore, the only option that accurately reflects what the passage states about Charles is that he holds a diploma."
Masuwa Trygvasson fleet ezalaki ya mboka nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Norvège**.

The text states: ""Mokumbi ya masuwa wana eza Olaf Trygvasson, moto moko ya **Norvège** oyo azalaki na mposa ya kobotola mboka na ye na maboko ya bato ya Danemark..."" (The leader of this battle was Olaf Trygvasson, a man from **Norway** who was aiming to expand his kingdom by taking advantage of the Danes...)
"
Na ngonga nini ya istware Alemagne ekabolaki makasi bizaleli na mboka estoni ?,"The correct answer is **D: Bambula 800 eleki**.

The text states: ""Pene ya ekeke ya 15, nordi ya Estonie ezalaki mpenza kolanda bizaleli ya bato ya Allemagne. **Bamoine mosusu ya Allemagne balingaki kobenda Nzambe pene ya bato ya bamboka wana, yango wana babimisaki lokota ya pete ya Estonie. Eutaki na alfabe ya Allemagne pe elembo moko """"Õ/õ"""" ebakisamaki. Nsima ya bambula, babandaka kodefa maloba mingi na lokota ya Allemagne. Ezalaki ebandeli ya kongengisama.**""

This translates to: ""In the 15th century, the north of Estonia was largely under the influence of the Germans. **Many Germans wanted to serve God among these people, which is why they built churches in Estonian style. Even though the German alphabet was used, the letter ""Õ/õ"" was not included. Consequently, they used a lot of German words in Estonian.** It was a process of assimilation.""

The text clearly indicates the German influence peaked in the 15th century.  While the exact year isn't given, the options provided are centuries later. Considering the context of ""influence"" and ""assimilation"", the 15th century is the most logical timeframe.  Therefore, the closest option representing the period of significant German influence is **D: Bambula 800 eleki** (800s).  Although the text specifically mentions the 15th century, it's the best approximation available among the options. The question is flawed because it asks for a specific number of centuries, but the text refers to a century (15th). We must choose the closest option that represents a period of significant influence.

"
Lokota ya Estoni ezuaki bizaleli kouta wapi?,"The correct answer is **A: Elembo Õ/õ**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Eutaki na alfabe ya Allemagne pe elembo moko """"Õ/õ"""" ebakisamaki.""  This translates to: ""However, in the German alphabet, there is only one character """"Õ/õ"""".""  Therefore, the Estonian alphabet uses the character Õ/õ.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ba Alphabets ya ba Alemands** - While the Estonian alphabet *is* influenced by the German alphabet, the question asks *where* the Estonian alphabet is found. It's found within the Estonian alphabet itself.
*   **C: Ba sango ya Alemagne** -  This refers to Old High German, a historical language. It's not the location of the Estonian alphabet.
*   **D: Nzambe** - This means ""God"" and is irrelevant to the question about the Estonian alphabet.

"Kolanda maloba wana, talo ya bato oyo basololaka lokota ya Hindu ekeseni pona nini?","The correct answer is **C: Soki bato oyo bakoki koyeba lokota yango bazali kotangema (Because the people who can speak the language are increasing).**

Here's why:

The passage states that the number of Hindi speakers is estimated between 340 and 500 million, and around 800 million people can understand the language. This indicates a growing number of people who can speak and understand Hindi.  This growth is the reason for the language's increasing reach and significance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soki minoko misusu oyo elandani na Hindu ezali kotangema (Because the numerous dialects that fall under Hinduism are increasing):** While there are dialects, the passage doesn't explicitly state that dialectal growth is the *reason* for the language's growing reach. It focuses on the increasing number of *speakers and understanders*.
* **B: Soki bato ya kosolola Urdu bazali kotangema (Because the people who speak Urdu are increasing):** Urdu and Hindi are closely related.  While Urdu speakers are growing, the passage focuses on Hindi speakers and understanders. The connection between Urdu and Hindi is mentioned, but not as the *primary* driver of Hindi's increasing reach.
* **D: Soki bato yakotanga munoko lokota bazali kotangema (Because the people who are learning the language are increasing):** This is similar to option C and partially correct, but option C is a more precise and direct answer to *why* the language's reach is increasing. Option C focuses on the capacity to understand and speak the language, which is a clearer indicator of the language's growing significance.



"
Na mae malandi maloba nini ezali yasolo pona lokota ya Hindu na Urdu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekokani na ekomeli mpe elobeli**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Hindi na Urdu eza na ndenge moko ndimbola kasi makomi ekeseni; na masolo ya mokolo na mokolo, balobi ya lokota nyonso mibale bakoki kosolola malamu.""  This translates to: ""Hindi and Urdu are essentially the same language but differ somewhat; on a daily basis, people say that almost all words are mutually intelligible.""

Therefore, the relationship is one of *mutual intelligibility* and *similarity* (ekokani na ekomeli mpe elobeli).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bato oyo basololaka lokota yango bayokanaka te** (People who speak the language don't understand each other): This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **B: Ekeseni na lolenge ya kokoma** (It differs in the way it is written): While there are writing system differences, the question asks about the *spoken* language.
* **D: Ekeseni na elobeli** (It differs in vocabulary): While there are vocabulary differences, the key point is that a significant amount of vocabulary is shared and understood.



"
Na mae malandi pona Alphabet Hangeul nini oyo ezali solo te?,"The correct answer is **B: Kombo ya solo ya alphabet ezalaki Hunan Jeongeum**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Na ebandeli apesaki yango nkombo alfabe ya Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum, oyo elimboli """"makelele ya malamu mpona koteya bato""""."" This translates to ""In 1444, it was presented with the alphabet of Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum, which means """"the orderly way for people to write.""""""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebandaki na ebandeli ya kibokonzi ya mokonzi Sejong:** While King Sejong commissioned the alphabet, the text explicitly mentions the name of the alphabet itself: Hunmin Jeongeum.
* **C: Esalemaki na Mokonzi ya minei ya Joseon Dynasty:**  This is partially true (it was during the Joseon Dynasty), but it doesn't pinpoint the specific name of the alphabet.  Hunmin Jeongeum is more specific.
* **D: Esalemaki pona litomba moko:** The text clearly indicates it was created for the purpose of allowing everyone to learn to write easily.



Therefore, option B directly and accurately answers the question based on the provided text.



"
Alphabet Hunan Jeongeum ebongwanaki kokoma nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Sejong**.

The passage states: ""Mokonzi Sejong azalaka mokonzi ya minei ya libota ya ba Joseon pe aza mokonzi oyo bato balingaka mingi koleka."" which translates to ""King Sejong was the most respected king of the Joseon dynasty...""  And later it says the alphabet was created by him. Therefore, the alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum originates from King Sejong.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Mokota nini ezuaki bizaleli ya Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **D: Makota ya Inde**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sanskrit eza lokota moko ya kala mpe eza ndenge moko na lokota ya Latin oyo balobaka na Eropa. **Sanskrit eza lokota moko ya mpasi mingi oyo eza na maloba mingi, yango nde esalisaka mpona kosala balokota mingi ya Inde ya lelo...**""

Therefore, Sanskrit is a very old language and a major language with a significant influence on the modern languages of India.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bosaleli ya Sanskrit ekitaki pona nini?","The correct answer is **B: Migration ya Aryan**.

Here's why:

* The passage directly states that one theory explains Sanskrit's spread by the migration of Aryans from the West to India.  The passage highlights the influence of the Aryan people on the Indian culture and their linguistic impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Makasi mingi (Very important):** While the migration is presented as *a* significant factor, the passage doesn't say it's *the most* important thing about Sanskrit.
* **C: Lokota ya Latin (The Latin language):**  The passage compares Sanskrit to Latin, but doesn't say Sanskrit *is* Latin.  It mentions the connection as a point of comparison.
* **D: Lolenge makambo etandami likolo (The source of ancient things):** While Sanskrit *is* an ancient language and has ancient texts, the passage focuses on *how* its spread is explained, not just its age.

Therefore, the migration of the Aryans is the primary reason mentioned in the passage for the importance of Sanskrit.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, liloba nini ezali ya solo pona Gravite ya Io?","The correct answer is **A: Gravite yam abele ekokoma mukia pona yo koleka gravite ya Io**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Soki ofandi na esika ya Io, okozala na kilo moke koleka soki ozalaki likolo ya mabele."" (If you were on Io, you would weigh less than you do on Earth.)
* **This implies:** The gravity on Io is weaker than the gravity on Earth.
* **Option A directly addresses this:** ""Gravite yam abele ekokoma mukia pona yo koleka gravite ya Io"" (The gravity is weaker for you compared to the gravity of Io).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gravite ya io ezali ebele, ntina na yango okozala na kilo mukie** (The gravity of Io is strong, so you would weigh more). - This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **C: Gravite ya io ezali ebele, ntina na yango okozala na kilo ebele** (The gravity of Io is strong, so you would weigh more). -  Same reason as B.
* **D: Gravite ya mabele ezali ebele pona yo koleka gravite ya Io** (The gravity of Earth is strong for you compared to the gravity of Io). - The text says you would weigh *less* on Io, meaning Io's gravity is weaker.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini elimboli malamu eteni ya libanda ya sanza?","The correct answer is **A: Eteni ya pene mingi ezali na croute ya muke monene** (The inner part is in a very thick crust).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Esika sanza eza ezali mabanga na putulu. Babengaka libanda ya sanza croûte."" (The core of the Earth is composed of layers, and the Earth has a crust.)  It further emphasizes the thickness of the crust.
* **The text mentions the size of the Earth:** ""Mabele ya makasi eza monene pene ya 70 km mopanzi ya pene mpe 100 km na mopanzi ya mosika."" (The radius is about 70 km in length and 100 km in width). This reinforces the concept of a substantial crust.
* **Option A directly addresses the thick crust.** The text implies that the inner part (the core) is surrounded by a very thick crust.
* **Options B, C, and D** are not directly supported by the text. While the Earth *does* have oceans (maria) and continents (bangomba), the core's thickness is the most prominent feature mentioned in relation to the layers.  The text doesn't specifically link oceans or continents to the core's structure.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, esika nini croute ya sanza ezali makasi koleka?","The correct answer is **C: Na bangomba ya mikie nase ya maria (Due to the high concentration of volcanic activity and the presence of maria)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Eza moke mingi na nse ya maria mpe mwa monene na bangomba ya mike."" (It is very large in the maria and has a large number of volcanoes).
* It further explains: ""Ekoki kozala na ba maria mingi mpenza pene po eloko wana eza moke."" (There can be many maria nearby, and that's why it is large).
*  The size of the crust is directly linked to the volcanic activity (bangomba) and the presence of maria. The text implies that the frequent volcanic activity and large maria contribute to the large size of the crust.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na mopanzi ya pene (On the side facing the Earth):** The text doesn't mention anything about the crust being thicker on one side facing Earth.
* **B: Esika maria ezali ebele (Where there are many maria):** While the presence of maria *contributes* to the size, it doesn't explain *why* the crust is thicker in certain areas. The text links it to volcanic activity *and* maria.
* **D: Nase ya maria (The presence of maria):** Similar to B, while maria are important, this is not the complete explanation. The volcanic activity is also a major factor.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini endimami na bato?","The correct answer is **A: Bato basili kosala mobenmbo na minzoto misusu (People are able to observe the stars more)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bato bakoki kosala mobembo na monzoto mosusu pe komona mikili mosusu"" which translates to ""People can observe the stars more and see further"".
* **Option A directly reflects this statement.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bato bazali na makoki te ya kokende komona mikili misusu (People are not able to see further).** This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **C: Bomoi ezali na ba planetes misusu (There are planets in other places).**  While the passage mentions planets, the main point is about observing stars, not about their existence.
* **D: Katikati ya minzoto distance ezali nase ya ba kilometer trillion (The distance between stars is trillions of kilometers).** The passage mentions the vastness of space and the distance between stars, but doesn't specifically state the distance in trillions of kilometers. It uses the term ""bamiliare ya bakilometele"" (billions of kilometers).



"
Nini ekomaka mukie mukie tango ozali kokende mosika na kati ya moi?,"The correct answer is **A: Plazma**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""Moi mobimba esalema na mipepe, moto, **pe plazma**."" which translates to ""I am mostly made of air, matter, and **plasma**.""  Then it asks what makes the most noise when you go to the center of me. The passage directly links plasma to the loud noise.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya moi emonanaka kouta na mabele?","The correct answer is **A: Croute**. Here's why:

* **The passage describes the Sun's layers.** It mentions the Sun being made of gas, plasma, and the layers that make up the surface.
* **The passage specifically refers to the ""boule ya pole"" (pole ball),** which is a common analogy for the visible surface of the Sun.
* **The visible surface of the Sun is called the photosphere.**
* **The layer *below* the photosphere is the ""croute"" (crust).** This is the layer we directly observe as the Sun's surface, and it's where sunspots and other features are visible. The passage is describing what we see, which is the photosphere but the question is asking for the layer where the Sun's composition is most clearly represented.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Plazma:** While the Sun *is* made of plasma, the passage isn't directly describing plasma.
* **C: Photosphere:** The photosphere *is* the visible surface, but the question asks for the layer that the Sun is *most clearly represented* by, i.e. the layer whose characteristics define the Sun. The crust is more accurately the layer of the Sun that we can see with our eyes, and from which our knowledge of the Sun's properties is based.
* **D: Eteni ya kati (Inner core):**  This is the deepest layer of the Sun and not what we are referring to in the passage.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **Croute** because it's the layer we can see that defines the Sun and where its characteristics are visible. It is also the layer closest to the surface.
"
Kati botali mae malandi fase nini esungaki kokokisa theory ya Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Bafase ya Venus (Phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **Galileo's observation of Venus's phases** was the crucial evidence that supported Copernicus's heliocentric theory.  The phases of Venus (like the phases of the Moon) could *only* be explained if Venus orbited the Sun, not the Earth.  If Venus orbited the Earth, it would always appear as a crescent or a full disk, never showing phases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Koleka ya Venus (Venus's rotation)** While Venus rotates, it wasn't the primary factor in supporting the heliocentric theory.  The phases are a much stronger indicator of a different orbital arrangement.
* **C: Kokokana ya Moi na Venus (The relationship between the Moon and Venus)** The relationship between the Moon and Venus didn't directly contribute to proving the heliocentric model.
* **D: Kokokana ya Moi na Sanza (The relationship between the Moon and the Sun)** While the Moon's relationship with the Sun is important, Galileo's observations of Venus were the direct, compelling evidence linked to Copernicus's theory.



"
Na mae malandi nini etalemaki na Galileo Galilei na mbula 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Bafase ya Venus**.

The passage states: ""Galileo Galilei asalelaki telescope mpona komona ete Venus eza na bafase, neti kaka sanza."" which translates to ""Galileo Galilei built a telescope to see that Venus has phases, like the Moon.""
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Ebale ya Aazon etokaka mai kouta wapi?","The correct answer is **B: Ebale ya molai koleka (Freshwater)**.

The text states: ""Amazom eza mpe ebale eleki monene na Mabele, ntango mosusu ezalaka molai bamiles motoba."" This translates to ""Amazon is also a large freshwater river, and it is often miles wide."" 

Therefore, the Amazon River is a large **freshwater** river.
"
Lokumu nini oyo elobami kozala ya Ebale Amazon?,"The correct answer is **B: Ezali Ebale ya munene koleka** (It is the largest river).

The text explicitly states: ""Mai mingi mbala 8 koleka ebale ya mibale ya monene koleka"" (It is 8 times larger than the largest river).  It also mentions ""Ebale monene ya Amazon 6 387 km (3 980 miles)"" (The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long). This indicates its immense size.
"
Mosala ya ndenge nini oyo elobelami na maloba wana ete epesaka talo mukie ya Bato ya Venezuela misala?,"The correct answer is **C: Essence**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that ""essence"" is a primary activity for Venezuelans and that a significant portion of the population is involved in it.  The text highlights the prevalence of essence production in Venezuela more than any other sector. Therefore, essence is presented as the most defining characteristic of the Venezuelan economy and workforce.



Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kolona (Agriculture):** While agriculture exists in Venezuela, the passage doesn't suggest it's the *dominant* activity or the most defining one.
*   **B: Ba industry (Industries):** The passage mentions industries, but it does not say that industries represent the most significant part of the Venezuelan economy.
*   **D: Mosala ya Biro (Office work):** The passage mentions office work as one of the sectors, but again, it's not portrayed as the most prominent activity.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na ba sectere nyonso oyo etangemi secter nini epesi ebele ya Bato ya Venezuela misala?","The correct answer is **A: Mosala ya Biro (Office work)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bato mibale na kati ya bato misato ya Venezuela oyo basalaka, basalaka na misala ya biro..."" which translates to ""The majority of Venezuelans who work, work in office jobs...""  This indicates that office work is the most common type of job in Venezuela.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kolona (Mining):** The text mentions mining as one sector, but doesn't say it's the *most* common.
*   **C: Ba industry (Industries):** The text mentions industries, but office work is explicitly stated as being done by the majority.
*   **D: Essence:** Essence is a product, not a job sector. The text describes it as something many Venezuelans produce as a side hustle.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, fusion esungaka minzoto kosala nini?","The correct answer is **D: Kosala ba Atomes hydrogene (Reacting hydrogen atoms)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Minzoto ebimisaka pole na molunge mpona nguya oyo esalemaka ntango ba atome ya hydrogène esanganaka mpona kosala biloko ya kilo.""

This translates to: ""Fusion happens in a core where the reaction that produces energy is when hydrogen atoms combine to form heavier elements.""

Therefore, the core process of fusion is the combination of hydrogen atoms.
"
Na mae malandi reacteur fusion ya litomba ekoki kosala nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Energy**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the goal of fusion reactors is to create energy by combining hydrogen atoms. While hydrogen and atoms are involved, the *result* of the fusion process is energy. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.
"
Bozaleli ya Chimi ya mai ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Atome hydrogen moko na atomes oxygene mibale** (One hydrogen atom and two oxygen atoms).

The passage states: ""Mai esalemi na baatome mibale ya hydrgene mpe atome moko ya oxygene."" which translates to ""Water is formed from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the chemical composition of water.
"
"Tango mai ebongoli lolenge ya kozala, nini ekotikala lolenge moko?","The correct answer is **A: Ba molecule**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Soki eza mai ezalaka ya kokangama kasi bamolecule ezalaka kaka ndenge moko. Mai eza ndakisa mosusu. Mai esalemi na baatome mibale ya hydrgene mpe atome moko ya oxygene.""  This translates to: ""If water is to combine, but the molecules are only one way. Water is very complex. Water is made of many hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""

This means that even when water changes state (e.g., from liquid to gas or solid to ice), it's still composed of the same molecules.  Therefore, the fundamental building blocks remain the same: molecules of H2O.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotonda na yango (Its expansion):** This refers to a physical change, not a fundamental component.
* **C: Lolenge ya komonana (The state of aggregation):**  This describes the physical form (solid, liquid, gas), not the constituent parts.
* **D: Liquide Nitrogene (Liquid Nitrogen):**  This is a completely different substance.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, pona bituku zomi na misato nini kati na mae malandi ezalaki likambo pona kotiya mibeko songolo pakala?","The correct answer is **C: Bongwana oyo esengelaki kondimama na bato nyonso (The fact that it was impossible for everyone to agree)**.

Here's why:

The passage clearly states that the Assembly (Congrès) lacked the power to enforce the laws and that laws were constantly changing due to the inability of the different groups to agree.  The core problem was the lack of consensus and the constant disagreements, making it difficult to establish stable and universally accepted laws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mikonzi ya likolo kotelemela makasi (The power of the aristocracy was very strong):** While aristocracy played a role in the political landscape, the passage focuses on the *lack of agreement among all groups*, not specifically on the power of the aristocracy.
* **B: Kozanga kibokonzi na Congrès (Establishing authority in the Congress):** The passage explicitly states the Congress lacked the authority to enforce laws.
* **D: Mokonzi ya kokamba oyo abanadaki komonana te (The structure of governance that prevented people from meeting):** The passage doesn't mention any structure preventing people from meeting; it's the *disagreement and lack of consensus* that's the problem.



Therefore, the central reason for the failure to establish lasting laws was the difficulty in achieving agreement amongst all the different factions."
"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini elimboli malamu lolenge ya boyangeli monene na tango ya etumba ya Botomboki","The correct answer is **B: Kobongola mibeko esalemaki koleka na makoki ya Congrès.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Congress lacked the power to enforce the laws and that the laws were often ignored by the people. 
* It also mentions that the laws were frequently rewritten and changed by the states, further diminishing the Congress's ability to control them.
* This directly indicates that the Congress was unable to effectively enforce the laws, leading to widespread disregard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kofuta mpako etiyamaki na makasi na Congrès mpe Boyangeli monene:** While the Congress struggled to enforce the laws, the passage focuses more on the inability of the Congress to *make* the laws stick, not specifically on the laws being repealed.
* **C: Mikonzi ya Leta bazalaki komonana te:** The passage doesn't explicitly state that the state governments didn't communicate. It highlights that they often refused to abide by the laws.
* **D: Boyangeli monene esalemaki na biloko mibale ya motuya:**  The passage doesn't mention any influence from outside forces or ""tribal"" factors.  It focuses on the internal struggles and weaknesses of the Congress and the laws themselves.



"
Maloba na sima ya mukanda ya lipanda ekomamaki ndenge nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Yako baluka (It's torn)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Atako eza na eloko bakoma na nsima ya mokanda wana, eza te karte ya malamu. Bakomaki yango nsima ya maloba ya lipanda; bakomaki maloba """"Maloba ya lipanga oyo balobi na mokolo ya 4 sanza ya nsambo 1776"""". **Maloba yango eza na nsima ya mokanda, ya kobaluka.**"" (It's not a regular card. They made it on parchment; they made the declaration ""Declaration of Independence proclaimed on the 4th of July 1776"". **The declaration is on the parchment, which is torn.**)



"
Na mae malandi Mboka Singapor eyebani pona nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Engumba ya mobesu (its beauty)**.

The text states that the Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid was selected as the national flower of Singapore in 1981 ""because of its beauty"".
"
Vanda Miss Joaquim ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Fololo**.

The text explicitly states that Vanda Miss Joaquim is a ""fololo orchidée hybride"" (hybrid orchid). 
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eloko nini na Pyramide ya Giza oyo Kibokonzi ya Egypte esepelaki na yango te?","The correct answer is **B: Bosaleli ya mabanga (The structure of the chambers)**.

Here's why:

The text states that while the pyramids of the New Kingdom were inspired by the pyramids of the Old Kingdom, they didn't replicate the internal structure (chambers) of the Giza pyramids. They built chambers for their own beliefs about the afterlife. Therefore, the structure of the chambers is what the New Kingdom Egyptians *didn't* copy from the Giza pyramids.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, banyama balei matiti basalaka mobembo kouta wapi pona koluka bambua?","The correct answer is **A: The western plains**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbula nyonso pene ya sanza ya zomi pene ya banyama 1,5 milio... bakatisaka ebale Mara, longwa na bangomba ya nordi mpona kokima bambula.""  This translates to: ""All the animals from the Great Migration... cross the Mara River, move to the northern plains to graze.""  Later it says ""Etuka ya Serengeti ezali na parke nationale ya Serengeti... esika babombaka biloko ya Maasai Mara na Kenya."" meaning The Serengeti plains are in Serengeti National Park... where they graze in Maasai Mara in Kenya.

The key is that the animals *move to the northern plains to graze*. The passage also mentions the Serengeti, which is located in the west of the Maasai Mara.

Therefore, the animals are moving to the **western plains** (the northern plains *within* the Serengeti context are in the west).
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Banyama balei matiti bautaka esika nini kobanda sanza ya minei?","The correct answer is **A: Etuka ya Serengeti**.

The text states: ""Nsima kozonga na nordi koleka na weste, kokatisa lisusu ebale Mara, nsima ya bambula ya sanza ya minei. Etuka ya Serengeti ezali na parke nationale ya Serengeti...""

This translates to: ""In the north, westwards, further across the Mara River, lies the grazing land of the minei savanna. The Serengeti Plains are in the Serengeti National Park...""

Therefore, the wildebeest migrate to the Serengeti Plains to graze on the minei savanna.
"
Operation Sealion ezalaki kokota na makasi ya Mboka nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Grande Britagne**.

The text states: ""Allemagne ebandaki kobongama mpona kokota na makasi na Grande-Bretagne."" (Germany was planning an invasion of Great Britain.)  Operation Sealion was the codename for Germany's planned invasion of Great Britain during World War II.
"
Alemagne ebengaki kobundisa Grande Britagne kombo nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The text states: ""Allemagne ebengaka bitumba wana """"Mosala Sealion""""."" which translates to ""Germany was planning this operation called ""Operation Sealion"".""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dunkirk:** Dunkirk is where British and Allied soldiers were evacuated, not the plan to attack Britain.
* **C: Kriegsmarine:** Kriegsmarine was the German Navy, not the operation itself.
* **D: Royal Navy:** The Royal Navy was the British Navy, and the operation was against them, not a description of the attack.
"
Na mae malandi nini oyo elobami te lokola eteni na malengeli ya Italy pona Kobotola Bamboka ya Africa?,"The correct answer is **A: Kolongola bamasuwa na Egypte**.

The text explicitly states: ""Longolaki bitika ya bamasuwa ya Grande Bretagne na Egypte."" which translates to ""They established trade routes with Great Britain and Egypt.""
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ezalaki ntina ya motuya ya Italy pona Etumba?","The correct answer is **A: Kokamata mikili ya Afrika**.

The text states: ""Mpona kozwa mikili wana, bakozala na bosenga ya masuwa mpona komema basoda na bango, mpo basoda wana bakatisa mbu ya Méditerranée mpe bakende kobotola Afrika."" (To obtain these resources, they developed a market system to obtain them, as these resources were transported by the Mediterranean Sea and used to exploit Africa.)

While options B, C, and D are mentioned as parts of the Italian trading activities, the main reason for their focus on the ""mass production of spun yarn"" (masuwa ya bitumba ya bato) was to **obtain the resources to fuel that production**, specifically by exploiting Africa.
"
Nani esalaki boyokani ya malamu na babotoli mboka?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Vichy French**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ezalaki bato ya France oyo basalaki kimia na bato ya Allemagne na 1940 pe basalaki elongo na babotoli mboka na esika ya kobundisa bango."" This translates to ""They were French people who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with foreign manufacturers in the area of assembling them."" The ""they"" refers to the Vichy French.
"
Banani bazalaki baninga oyo basalisaki na Operation Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba Ameriken na Bato ya France ya mpole (French Free Forces)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the operation involved French people who had been collaborating with the Germans (the Vichy government) but were fighting *against* them. These are referred to as the ""Mosala Dragoon"" and were part of the Free French forces.
* It also clearly mentions American soldiers participating in the operation.

Therefore, the combination of American soldiers and the French Free Forces is the correct answer.
"
Bozalisi ya teknolozi nini esalaki ba sou-marin kobanda kotambola nase ya mai?,"The correct answer is **A: U-Boats**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bato ya Allemagne bayebaki malamu kotambola na ebale mpe kosalela bamasuwa na bango ya basoda. Mpona bolongi na bango na basoda babundaka na mai, nsima ya bitumba, eza neti bato ya Allemagne baza na yango ebele te."" This translates to: ""The Germans knew how to sail underwater and attack ships with them. For the sake of their ships, before the periscopes, the Germans had a lot of them.""  The ""them"" refers to the U-boats (U-Boats).

Therefore, the Germans' **U-Boats** are what allowed submarines to operate underwater.
"
"Na Bosaleli na bango ya yambo, ba sou-marin bazalaki na esika mukie ya kotambola na esika nini?","The correct answer is **B: Kotambola (Swimming/Navigating)**.

The passage states: ""Basalelaki basous-marins na bitumba ya liboso pe ya mibale ye mokili mobimba. Na ntango wana, ezalaki kotambola malembe mpenza pe ezalaki na masasi mingi te."" which translates to: ""They were traveling in the deep and vast waters. Therefore, they were traveling frequently and very far.""

While the other options relate to activities, ""kotambola"" is the most general and accurate description of what submarines do.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani abebisaki boyokani? ","The correct answer is **D: Ba Soviets**.

The text clearly states that in 1939, the Polish soldiers were only fighting with the help of Romanian troops. However, it then describes a massive Soviet offensive where 800,000 Soviet soldiers invaded Belarus and Ukraine to attack the eastern part of Poland and *establish a chemical defense line (boyokani ya kimia) along the Riga chemical defense line*, which was a division between the Soviet Union and Poland. This was a large-scale operation. Therefore, the Soviets were responsible for establishing this defense line.
"
Na mae malandi nini oyo esalemaki te na Mapinga ya Motane to Red Army?,"The correct answer is **D: Kobebisa boyokani (Chemical warfare)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""ntango basoda koleka 800 000 ya Union soviétique ya motane bakotaki pe basalaki boyokani ya Biélorusse na Ukraine nsima ya kokota na bituka ya este ya Pologne pe kozanga kotosa boyokani ya kimia ya Riga, boyokani ya kozanga kobunda kati na Union Sovietique na Pologne.""

This translates to: ""when Soviet troops advanced 800,000 into Belarus and Ukraine before invading the eastern part of Poland and attempting to deploy chemical warfare of Riga, a chemical warfare that would have been created between the Soviet Union and Poland.""

The text explicitly mentions the attempt to use **chemical warfare**.  The other options are incorrect based on the information given:

* **A: Kosala boyokani na Ukrene (Conducting warfare in Ukraine):** While warfare occurred in Ukraine, the text focuses on the *type* of warfare attempted.
* **B: Kokota na makasi na Bituka ya East (Pushing hard into the Eastern Front):** The text mentions the advance, but the core focus is on the specific tactic (chemical warfare).
* **C: kobongama lisusu na nzela ya bagbagba (Continuing through the help of collaborators):** The text states that collaborators were *already* being used.  The attempt to deploy chemical warfare was a separate, distinct action.



"
Nini esalemaki na Ingenieur mokonzi ya Mapinga ya zomi ya Italy?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba Britanik bakangaki ye**.

The text states: ""Na motambo batielaka bato na este ya Bardia, ba Britanik bakangaki ingénieur mokonzi ya etuluku ya zomi ya basoda ya Italie, general Lastucci.""  This translates to ""In the fighting in the east of Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the Italian army, general Lastucci.""
"
Babomelaki Italo Balbo wapi?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The question asks where Italo Balbo was informed of the situation. The text states: ""Marshal Italo Balbo, Guvernere monene ya Lybie mpe mokitani ya Mussolini, **babomaki ye na masisi ya moninga moko ntango azalaki kokita na Tobruk**."" (Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and Mussolini's confidant, was informed that he was continuing to Tobruk.)
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, mayele nini na mae malandi ezali ya litomba mingi na Bomanioli ya Tibetan ?","The correct answer is **B: Kozongela mantras**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Na lisalisi ya Kundalini Yoga, nguya ya Kundalini (nguya ya pole) ebimaka na bafoto ya yoga, **bangalasisi ya kopema, ba mantras pe bimonaneli**.""  This translates to: ""In the practice of Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the coiled serpent) manifests through yoga postures, **mantras, and visualisations**.""

Therefore, the passage directly links the practice of mantras to the power and effectiveness of Tibetan Buddhism's yogic practices.  The other options are either related but not as directly emphasized as mantras in the passage, or not mentioned at all.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, lolenge nini bachakras efungwamaka na tango ya “Litomba monene” ya Bomanioli ya Tibetan","The correct answer is **C: Repetition ya Mantras**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na lisalisi ya Kundalini Yoga, nguya ya Kundalini (nguya ya pole) ebimaka na bafoto ya yoga, bangalasisi ya kopema, **ba mantras** pe bimonaneli.""  This directly links the repetition of mantras to the activation of chakras.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Na nzela ya bafoto ebele ya yoga:** While yoga postures (asanas) are part of Kundalini Yoga, the text specifically highlights mantras as a key factor in chakra activation.
* **B: Na nzela ya komona kibonzambe:**  While devotion (bhakti) plays a role in Tibetan Buddhism, the text focuses on the practical techniques of Kundalini Yoga for chakra activation.
* **D: Kosala bangalasisi ya kopema:**  While mudras (hand gestures) are used in yoga, the text doesn't emphasize them as the primary method for chakra activation in the context of the ""Litomba monene"" (Great Vehicle) of Tibetan Buddhism.



"
Nani ayembaki nzembo ya losambo ya mibale na tango ya molulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanju Sharma**.

The text states: ""Moyembi Sanju Sharma afungolaki makambo na pokwa wana..."" which translates to ""Singer Sanju Sharma opened the proceedings at that time...""  This indicates he started the devotional singing.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Nani ayembaki nzembo ya losambo na ngonga ya makabo ya bilei?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Na nsima, Lakkha Singh azwaki esika ya liboso na koyemba banzembo ya bhajans."" which translates to ""In the evening, Lakkha Singh went to the stage to sing bhajans.""
"
Nini ezalaki eteni ya pene ya suka ya pokwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou**.

The text explicitly states: ""Diva ya Turquie Sezen Aksu ayembaki eleongo na moyembi ya ténor ya Italie Alessandro Safina mpe moyembi ya Grese Haris Alexiou."" (Turkish diva Sezen Aksu collaborated with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.)

While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are not the answer to the question ""Nini ezalaki eteni ya pene ya suka ya pokwa?"" (Who are the main performers/artists involved in the show?). The show features performances by these three singers."
Alessandro Safina azalaki ya mboka nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Italy**.

The text explicitly states: ""...moyenbi ya ténor ya Italie Alessandro Safina..."" which translates to ""...tenor singer from Italy Alessandro Safina..."".
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, liloba nini ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **D: Ezuaki pene ya ba ngonga 60 ponakobimisa moto ya liboso na nzela.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the angle was 90 degrees. Option D suggests a much smaller angle (60 degrees) which contradicts the information provided.
* Option A is true, but it doesn't highlight what is *not* true.
* Option B is true, but again, doesn't represent what is *not* true.
* Option C is true, but also doesn't address what is *not* true. 

The key part of the captain's statement is that the 90-degree angle was ""mokolo ya moi makasi"" (extremely difficult) and that ""esengaki kaka ngonga moko mpona kolongola moto ya liboso na nzela"" (only one rope is needed to rescue the person).  Option D directly contradicts the difficulty of the situation by suggesting a smaller, easier angle. Therefore, it's the statement that is not true according to the passage.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani alobaki eloko na mae matali makasi mingi ya molunge?","The correct answer is **B: Mokonzi ya babomi moto (Police)**.

The text states: ""Kapitene ya Babomi-moto Scott Kouns alobaki..."" which translates to ""Police Captain Scott Kouns said..."". Therefore, the police are the ones who made the statement about the extensive damage.
"
Na bisika nini courant ebungaki pona makambo ya Tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""mbeba moko te esalemi pe moto moko te azoki na Tonga, kasi courant ekatanaki mpona ntango mokuse..."" which translates to ""a single wave did not occur and no one could see it in Tonga, but the current pushed it towards the south...""
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kobunga ya courant esalaki nini na Tonga?","The correct answer is **B: Mikonzi bazuaki nsango te na mae matali bolongoli ya bokebisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbeba moko te esalemi pe moto moko te azoki na Tonga, kasi courant ekatanaki mpona ntango mokuse, yango esalaki ete bakonzi ya Tonga bazwi te makebisi etali tsunami wana oyo PTWC epesaki.""  This translates to: ""The wave alone does not happen and no one can go to Tonga, but the current flows towards the east, which is why the authorities in Tonga did not issue an alert for the tsunami that PTWC issued.""

This indicates that the Tonga authorities were *not* aware or unable to issue an alert, implying a lack of ability or procedure related to tsunami warnings.  Option B directly reflects this – the authorities are ""not in a position to issue an alert.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba raport ya biloko kobeba epesamaki:** (Reports of what happened were given) - While reports may exist, the passage focuses on *why* an alert wasn't issued.
* **C: Lolenge ya kotalela ebale mpe ezalaki matata:** (The time to detect the wave was difficult) -  The passage doesn't mention difficulties in detecting the wave.
* **D: Mikonzi bazangaki makoki ya kozua bokebisi ya malonga:** (The authorities were unable to create a helpful alert) - The passage doesn't say the authorities *couldn't* create an alert, just that they *didn't* issue one. It's a difference in action, not ability.



"
Na ngonga nini police esalelaki monduki ya Radar na bango pona koyeba vitesi ya Johnny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: Na tango azalaki kokumba na vitesi ya 160km/h**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Polisi ya Nouvelle-Zelande ezokoka te kosalela ba radare na yango ya vitesi mingi mpona koyeba na vitese nini M. Reid azalaki kokende, mpona mozindo ya Black Beauty, pe mbala moko pamba oyo polisi ezwaki ngonga oyo M. Reid asalaki, ezalaki ntango akitisaka vitese na ye na 160 km/h.""

This translates to: ""The New Zealand police do not use speed radars to find out how fast Mr. Reid is going, for the sake of Black Beauty, and once the police caught him, it was when he was going at 160 km/h.""

Therefore, the police used radar *when he was going at 160 km/h*. Options B, C, and D are not supported by the text.
"
"Koalanda maloba wana, pona nini ezalaki makasi na Police koyeba vistesi ya Johnny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: Azalaki kokumba nase ya 160km/h**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Jonny Reid repeatedly reaches 160 km/h on the Auckland Harbour Bridge. The police are trying to determine his speed *because* he is reaching such high speeds. The other options are irrelevant to the reason for the police's interest.



"
Koningana ya mabele na Butte esalemaki mingi na esika nini?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 kilometre na Sud**.

The text states: ""Koningana ya mabele ezalaki pene ya 65 km (40 miles) na sudi ya Butte."" This translates to ""The landslide is about 40 km (25 miles) south of Butte.""
"
Nini esalemaki na tango ya botomboki na Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Konyokola bakangami** (Torture of prisoners).

The provided text states that the Abu Ghraib prison scandal involved abuse and torture of prisoners by US soldiers.  The other options don't accurately reflect the events of the Abu Ghraib scandal.
"
Pona nini Boloko ya Iraq ezuaki lokumu? ,"The correct answer is **B: Mapinga ya Amerike ezuaki bokambi (American abuses were a cover-up)**.

Here's why:

The question refers to the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.  This scandal involved abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US soldiers. The core issue was that the US military attempted to cover up these abuses.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Etumbamaki (Inactivity/Lack of action):** While there *was* a lack of proper oversight, the scandal wasn't primarily due to general inaction. It was due to specific, documented abuses.
* **C: Botomboki ezalkai ebele (There were many prisoners):** The number of prisoners doesn't explain the abuse.  Abuse happened even with relatively small numbers of prisoners.
* **D: Bonyokoli ya bakangami Emonanaki (Informant actions were expected):**  The scandal wasn't about informants; it was about the soldiers' actions and the attempts to conceal those actions.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the underlying cause and nature of the Abu Ghraib scandal is that American abuses were covered up.



"
Molulu nini esengelaki kosalema na Maui's War Memorial Stadium?,"The correct answer is **A: Magic show**.

The text states: ""Etuluku wana wana balobaki bakosala lisusu te spectacle na War Memorial Stadium ya Maui; bato 9 000 balingaka koya na likambo yango, pe basengaki bafana na bango bolimbisi."" This translates to: ""Therefore, they announced another spectacle at Maui's War Memorial Stadium; 9,000 people came to see it, and the children were delighted."" Spectacles often include magic shows. The other options are less likely given the context.
"
Nani epesaki ntina pona nini molulu epekisamaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Compani oyo ezali Kokamba (The company that is organizing)**.

The text states: ""Lisanga oyo ezotambwisi kompani, HK Management Inc., epesaki ata ntina moko te tanga balongolaki oyo balingaki kosala na mokolo ya 20 sanza ya libwa, kasi na mokolo elandaki balobelaki makambo ya kobongisa molulu."" 

This translates to: ""The organization, HK Management Inc., didn't even give a single permit for the planned event on the 20th of the month, but on the day it was cancelled, they announced they would apologize.""

Therefore, HK Management Inc. (the organizing company) is the one offering the apology.
"
Bafandi ebele ya Bishkek bandimaki ete ba nani basalaki ete bobotoli esalema?,"The correct answer is **C: Batomboki (Thieves/Pickpockets)**.

The text states: ""Bafandi mingi ya Bichkek bafundi batomboki bautaki na sudi oyo batosaka mibeko te."" which translates to ""Many residents of Bishkek say that thieves are causing problems in the area where they set up their stalls.""  The word ""batomboki"" means thieves or pickpockets.



"
Nani alobaki ete batomboki kouta sud nde basalaki bobotoli?,"The correct answer is **A: Bafandi ya Bishkek**.

The text states: ""Bafandi mingi ya Bichkek bafundi batomboki bautaki na sudi oyo batosaka mibeko te."" This translates to ""Many residents of Bishkek are dissatisfied with the situation where people are allowed to do whatever they want.""

Therefore, the residents of Bishkek are the ones expressing dissatisfaction.
"
Na tango nini ring esombamaki ebele?,"The correct answer is **A: Sima ya komonana na Shark Tank**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ring ekataki mpe likambo ya kosambisa na lisanga moko ya libateli, lisanga ADT. **Sima ya 2013 na filme moko ya Shark Tank esika ezolakisa bakolo na yango bazoboya kofuta mosolo po ebanda.**"" This means Ring gained significant exposure and recognition after appearing on Shark Tank.
"
Na tango nini Jamie Siminoff akanaki kobanda Ring?,"The correct answer is **B: Sima ya kozanga komonana na Shark Tank**.

The text states: ""Alobaki ete batekaki mingi nsima ya kobima na ye na 2013 na filme moko ya Shark Tank esika ezolakisa bakolo na yango bazoboya kofuta mosolo po ebanda."" This translates to: ""He said he had been pitching for a long time before being invested in on a 2013 episode of Shark Tank where investors agreed to buy his company to go into business.""

While the other options are related to Ring's history, the Shark Tank appearance is specifically mentioned as a significant turning point for the company.
"
Eteni moko na moko ya kotanga Arc en Ciel esungaki bana na lolenge nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Babuku**.

The text explicitly states: ""Emission nyonso ezalaki mpe kolobela babuku bana basengeli koluka soki bakei na biblioteke."" which translates to ""The entire program also encourages children to read books if they go to the library.""
"
Nini ekokaki kosala ete emission ya Television ya kotanga Arc en Ciel epekisama?,"The correct answer is **A: Kozanga mbongo ya kokoka** (Encourages reading).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kotanga arc en ciel eteyaki banda ndenge ya kotanga,... bolingo ya kotanga — [filme] elendisaka bana na kokamata buku mpe kotonga yango."" (Watching ""Arc en Ciel"" is like watching... the love of reading - [the show] encourages children to read books and understand them.)

The passage highlights that John Grant believes the show encourages children to read and engage with books.  The other options are not supported by the text:

* **B: Kozanga Emmy awards** - The text doesn't mention Emmy awards.
* **C: Emoneli ya John Grant** - While John Grant *said* it encourages reading, the text focuses on *what the show does* rather than his personal opinion or credentials.
* **D: Elonga ya esika ya kofanda ya Mister Rogers** - The text mentions Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood as examples of shows that encourage reading, but it doesn't connect Arc en Ciel specifically to Mister Rogers' style.



"
Na mae malandi nini ezalaki te kati ya bantina ya mikonzi ya Amsterdam na musee pona nzete,"The correct answer is **A: Ekosuka na kokweya (It's due to the crowds)**.

The provided text states: ""Bakonzi ya engumba Amsterdam pe ya musée Anne Frank balobi ete nzete wana eza na mayebo pe eza likama mpona bato mpo balobi ete kala mingi te yango eza na likama ya kokwea.""  This translates to: ""The staff of Amsterdam and the Anne Frank museum say that the exhibit is crowded and a place for people to say that it is very difficult to see.""

The text indicates the problem is the crowds.  Options B, C, and D describe *what* the exhibit is (crowded, a place for people, on display) but don't explain *why* people can't see it. Option A addresses the reason for the difficulty: the crowds.
"
"Kolanda Mokonzi inspecteur ya RSPCA, ba inspection esengeli kosalema malamu pona nini?","The correct answer is **A: Ba Camera CCTV**.

The text explicitly states: ""Molandeli-mokambi ya RSPCA New South Wales, David O'Shannessy, alobaki na ABC ete kokengela pe kolandela bisika babomaka banyama esengeli kosalemaka mingi na Australie. **CCTV akotinda mpenza signale ya makasi na bato oyo bazosala na banyama ete bolamu na bango eza likambo ya ntina mingi koleka ba biloko ya kotalela.**""

While CCTV *allows* for observing animal locations (D), the core of the problem and the solution being proposed is the use of CCTV cameras. The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kosunga kolendisa litomba ya bozali malamu ya banyama epai ya bato oyo basalaka mosala na bisika ya koboma banyama na Australi","The correct answer is **A: Kotiya ba Camera CCTV**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""RSPCA ezosenga batia lisusu ba camera ya video mpona kokengela bisika nyonso ya Australie oyo babomaka banyama."" (RSPCA is urging the use of video cameras to monitor all places where animals are kept in Australia.)
* **The passage further explains the benefit:** ""CCTV akotinda mpenza signale ya makasi na bato oyo bazosala na banyama ete bolamu na bango eza likambo ya ntina mingi koleka koleka."" (CCTV is very effective in signaling to people who deal with animals that their welfare is more important.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bokutani na RSPCA na kozanga te:** The passage describes the RSPCA *urging* the use of cameras, not discouraging it.
* **C: Kotalaka Bisika ya koboma banyama mbala na mbala:** This is implied but not the primary solution advocated. Cameras provide constant monitoring.
* **D: ABC Kotalelaka malamu:**  ABC is reporting the news; it's not a solution to the problem.



Therefore, the most direct and supported answer is using CCTV cameras.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, moto oyo bakangaki ye azalaki kosala mosala nini?","The correct answer is **C: President ya Tribal**.

The text states: ""...bakonzi balobaki makambo mingi mpona kondimisa bato bakangi lelo. Kasi, bato baza na basango ya ankete bayebisaki Minneapolis Star-Tribune ete ezalaki Louis Jourdain, mwana ya **mibu 16 ya president ya Red Lake Tribal**, Floyd Jourdain.""

This directly identifies Louis Jourdain as the son of the President of the Red Lake Tribal.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na tango bansango ezalaki kopanzana na mae matali bokangemi mosusu, bamatanga ezalaki kosalema pona bato boni?","The correct answer is **C: Libwa**

Here's why:

The question asks how the death toll grew after the initial report. The passage states: ""Sango epanzani lelo na bato ya lisanga ya Red Lake ntango bazalaki matanga ya Jeff Weise mpe ya bato misato mosusu bakufaki...""  This means the death toll started at Jeff Weise and then added five more, bringing the total to six.  The phrase ""bato misato mosusu"" translates to ""five more people."" Therefore, the total number of deaths is now six. The option that corresponds to six is ""Libwa"" (Six).



"
"Pona mae matali babotomboki, ba mboka nini ekokisaki te boyokani oyo batiaki moboko elongo na ACTA?","The correct answer is **B: Pologne (Poland)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bato mingi batombokaki na Pologne ntango mboka etiaki maboko na ACTA, oyo epusi boyangeli ya Pologne na kotia te maboko na boyokani, mpona sikoyo.""  This translates to ""Many people protested in Poland because of Poland's refusal to give up control of its sovereignty because of ACTA.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Allemagne (Germany)** - The passage mentions protests *in* Germany, but doesn't say Germany *refused* to sign ACTA.
*   **C: Ecosse (Scotland)** - The passage mentions protests *in* Scotland, but doesn't say Scotland refused to sign ACTA.
*   **D: Lithuani (Lithuania)** - The passage mentions protests *in* Lithuania, but doesn't say Lithuania refused to sign ACTA.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, mboka nini na mae malandi eboyaki kokoba na eteni yakokota na ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Laettoni**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lettonie na Slovaquie bango mibali bazelisi miango ya kokota na ACTA."" This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia are actively showing signs of opposition to ACTA."" Since Latvia is listed as ""Laettoni"" in the options, it's the correct choice.
"
Bato boni bazokaki pona makama ya baiPod ya mabe oyo ezalaki kokoma moto?,"The correct answer is **B: 27**.

The passage states: ""Ministre ya nkita, ya mombongo mpe ya industrie ya Japon (METI) alobaki ete basi bayebi makama 27 oyo euti na biloko wana."" This translates to ""The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that 27 people who examined the matter...""  These are the people who saw the defective iPods.
"
Nani alobaki ete makama ya baIpod kokoma moto ezalaki mabe makasi te?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The text states: ""Poso eleki, METI alobaki ete Apple eyebisi yango makama 34 mosusu ya sika, oyo kompani wana ebengaki """"ya makasi te."""" "" which translates to ""However, METI said that Apple had provided them with 34 more cases, which the company said were """"not serious."""""". This means Apple claimed the problem wasn't as severe as reported.
"
"Na tango ya lisolo naye, Steve Jobs alobaki ete Apple ekosala nini ya sika?","The correct answer is **A: Istware (Technology)**.

The question asks what Steve Jobs said Apple was now. The text states: ""Lelo Apple akosala lisusu telefone, Tokosala istware lelo"" which translates to ""Today Apple is again making phones, We are a technology company today."" Therefore, he declared Apple was a **technology** company.
"
Litomba ya lisolo ya Steve Jobs pona bangonga mibale ezalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Kobimisa Telefone ya sika** (To revolutionize the telephone).

The text states: ""Lelo Apple akosala lisusu telefone, Tokosala istware lelo"" which translates to ""Today Apple is making a telephone again, We are revolutionizing the telephone today.""

Therefore, Steve Jobs' goal was to revolutionize the telephone.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner apesaki nsango nini na kati ya ndako ya Cinema ya Argentine?,"The correct answer is **B: Makanisi naye yakopesa kombo pona maponi ya Senat** (Her campaign team held a meeting to campaign for her Senate election).

The text clearly states: ""Mme Kirchner ayebisaki makanisi na ye ya kopesa nkombo na maponi ya president ya Théâtre ya Argentine, esika moko wana oyo asalelaki mpona kobanda kampanie na ye Senat na 2005 lokola mosangani ya etuka ya Buenos Aires."" This translates to: ""Mrs. Kirchner used her campaign team to hold a meeting at the President's Theater of Argentina, which is why she ran a campaign for her Senate in 2005 as a representative of the Buenos Aires district.""

Therefore, option B is the most accurate description of what happened.
"
Na esika nini Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner apesaki nsago été akozala na maponi ?,"The correct answer is **A: Na ndako ya Cinema 31 kilometere na Plata** 

Here's why:

The text states: ""Senatere ya mwasi ya sikoyo pe mwasi ya president ya Argentina, Crisntina Fernandez de Kirchner, alobaki akozala candidat na maponi ya president lobi na pokwa na La Plata, engumba oyo eza pene ya bakilometele 50 (31 miles) na Buenos Aires."" 

This translates to: ""The wife of the vice president and the wife of the president of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, ran for president in La Plata, a city about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.""  The text also mentions she campaigned at the Teatro Argentino in La Plata.  

Option A accurately reflects this: ""Na ndako ya Cinema 31 kilometere na Plata"" - ""At the Cinema 31 kilometers from Plata"". The question incorrectly refers to ""cinema"" instead of ""Teatro Argentino"". However, it is the closest answer reflecting the location of the campaign.



"
ACMA emonaki nini na mae matali Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **C: Mibeko ya kopekisa biloko na internet ebukanaki** (The rules about copying things on the internet do not apply).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Big Brother ebuki te mibeko ya kopekisa biloko na internet... kasi po baloba ete eloko moko eza eloko batie na internet, esengeli kozala na serveur moko.""  This translates to: ""Big Brother does not have rules about copying things on the internet... but they say that the thing is something they put on the internet, it must be on a single server.""

The core of the question is what ACMA is saying about Big Brother's rules regarding internet copying. The answer implies that Big Brother's rules *don't* apply to content they themselves have uploaded, as long as it's on their own server. Therefore, the rules about internet copying are essentially suspended for Big Brother's own content.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mibeko yakopekisa biloko na internet ebuakami te** (Rules about copying things on the internet do not exist) - This is too strong. The text implies rules *do* exist, but they don't apply to Big Brother's own content.
* **B: Biloko emonanaki kotiyama na website ya Big Brother** (The thing can be watched on the Big Brother website) - This is irrelevant to ACMA's statement about the rules.
* **D: Biloko ezuamaki kozala na server** (The thing must be on a server) -  This is a *condition* for the rules not applying, not ACMA's main point.

Esengeli eloko ezala na esika nini pona kobengama biloko ya interenet ?,"The correct answer is **B: Esengeli ezala na kati ya server** (It must be on a server).

Here's why:

The question asks where content should be located to be considered part of the internet. The provided text states that ACMA (the regulatory body) is concerned with content that is on a server, not just anywhere on the internet.  The text highlights that even though content is shared on the internet, it *must* reside on a server for ACMA's regulations to apply.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esengeli ezala na interenet** (It must be on the internet) -  While true, this is too broad. The text emphasizes the *server* aspect.
* **C: Ekoki te kozala na kati ya site** (It cannot be on a site) - This is incorrect. Content *is* on websites (sites), but the key is where the content *resides* – on a server.
* **D: Esengeli kozua ndingisa ya ACMA** (It must be approved by ACMA) -  This is incorrect.  While ACMA has regulations, the location of the content is the primary concern, not just ACMA's approval.



"
Nani nde Mokambi ya lisanga ya Liberal Party Austarli,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""Peter Costello, moko abombaka mbongo ya Austrie pe moto ndenge ezomonana akozwa esika ya premier ministre John Howard lokola mokonzi ya parti ya lipanda..."" which translates to ""Peter Costello, who was Treasurer of Australia and a person known to be considered as successor to Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the Liberal Party...""



"
Pona nini Australi ezali kozanga nguya ya nikleyere ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kozanga lisungi ya bato (To save the planet)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Peter Costello alobaki ete ntango kosala nguya ya nikleyere ekokoma ntina mingi mpona kozwa mosola, Australie ekokoba kosalela yango.""  This translates to: ""Peter Costello said that it is very important to take action to save the planet, Australia must take it."" This directly links the reason for taking action on climate change to saving the planet.

The other options don't align with the provided text:

*   **B: Ezali ya makelele ebele (It's very profitable):** The text focuses on the importance of action, not profit.
*   **C: Ezali Likama monene (It's a big problem):** While climate change is a big problem, the text highlights the *solution* – taking action – not just the problem itself.
*   **D: Talo mingi (Too much):** This is too vague and not supported by the text.



"
Moto ya ski nini asalaki masano na lisungi ya mokambi?,"The correct answer is **D: Anna Ogarzynska**.

The text states: ""Moto ya ski ya Pologne Maciej Krezel na motambwisi Anna Ogarzynska basilisaki na bisika ya zomi na misato na Super-G."" This translates to ""The Polish skier Maciej Krezel and the **mountaineer** Anna Ogarzynska finished in third place in the Super-G.""

Therefore, Anna Ogarzynska is the mountaineer mentioned in the text.
"
Mboka nini esilisaki na esika ya zomi na “the Super-G na women’s standing class”?,"The correct answer is **A: Filande (Finland)**.

The text states: ""moto ya Finlande Katja Saarinen oyo asilisaki na esika ya zomi na komekama moko wana."" which translates to ""Finnish woman Katja Saarinen finished in the second place in the women's standing class.""

Therefore, the answer is Finland.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, liloba nini na mae matali Blake ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **C: Asalelaki nzete na ngonga ya etumba**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Balobaki ete Blake azalaki koluka kobebisa makambo po basambisa yango malamu te."" This translates to ""They said that Blake was reluctant to return things or to give them back easily.""

The phrase ""asalelaki nzete na ngonga ya etumba"" means ""was reluctant to return things or to give them back easily."" This directly reflects Blake's unwillingness to comply with the return requests, which is the core of the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakangaki ye ebayelo** (They contacted him on eBay): This is a fact, but doesn't explain *why* Blake is refusing.
* **B: Andimaki pona etumba** (He responded to the requests): The text states he wasn't responding *easily* – he was reluctant.
* **D: Alobaki ete babwakelaki ye milangi** (They accused him of fraud): While the accusations exist, the main point of Blake's reluctance is the difficulty he's causing with the returns.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi esalemaki na Blake te?","The correct answer is **C: Babundisaki ye na nzete**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Zuzi ayebisaki Blake ete likoki """"ezali ata moke te"""" bakotinda ye na boloko."" This translates to ""Zuzi told Blake that it was """"not even possible"""" to continue with the business and to give up.""  ""Batinda ye na boloko"" means ""they gave up on him"" or ""they told him to give up."" This is the same as giving him a reason to stop, essentially a hard rejection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakutaki ye na mbeba ya kolinga kotia mobulu na esambiselo** (They accused him of trying to defraud the business): While the eBay user *claimed* this, the text doesn't state that Blake was actually accused.
* **B: Bakangaki ye** (They argued with him): The text mentions disagreement and frustration, but doesn't specifically state they argued.
* **D: Bayebisaki ye ete akokaki kotindama na boloko** (They told him he couldn't continue working):  While related, it doesn't fully capture the sense of giving up/rejection as well as ""babundisaki ye na nzete"".
"
Mbongo ya Nations-Unies mpona kosalisa mikili oyo ezoniokwama na molunge makasi ekoki kosalelama te pona nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba ndako pona bilei ebele (Many different sectors)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the issue is a ""huge challenge"" (mikili oyo ezoniokwama na molunge makasi) affecting many areas (bandako oyo ekotisaka te mai, oyo ekangaka mai mpe milona ya ndenge na ndenge).  The UN needs funding to address this challenge across numerous sectors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kobimisa bambuma ebele (Publishing many books):**  While information is important, it doesn't directly address the core problem of funding a large-scale solution.
*   **B: Komema Teknolozi na mikilo ya bobola na kokola (Providing technology in large quantities for cooking):** This is a possible *solution* but not the reason *why* the UN's funding efforts might be hindered.
*   **D: Kokitisa ba effets ya Mulunge makasi na Mokili (Mitigating the effects of climate change on the planet):** This describes the *problem*, not the reason for funding difficulties.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Nations-Unies ezali na elikia yakobikisa nini?","The correct answer is **A: Mbongo, nanzela ya kokaba teknolozie** (Funding, technological solutions).

The passage states: ""Nations-Unies ezali na elikia ya kobongisa mbongo mpona kosalisa mikili oyo ezoniokwama na molunge makasi na kobunda na yango."" which translates to ""The United Nations is eager to raise funds to address the huge problem in a very serious way and to combat it.""

And later: ""Bakoki kosalela mbongo wana mpona bandako oyo ekotisaka te mai, oyo ekangaka mai mpe milona ya ndenge na ndenge."" which translates to ""They can allocate this funding to areas that do not produce money, which produces money and millions of ways."" This indicates the funding is for technological solutions.

Therefore, the UN is eager to raise **funding** and use **technological solutions** to tackle the problem.

Na mae malandi nini oyo elobamaki te na Albert Muchanga lokola eloko oyo esengelaki koyokana pona yango?,"The correct answer is **B: Mokolo oyo mosala ekobanda**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Komisere alobaki ete, """"Toyokani naino mibeko ya ebandeli pe ya kondima kokitisa talo, kasi ntango ya kosala yango ebongi mpo tokobanda misala na **mokolo ya 1 sanza ya nsambo 2020**"""""" which translates to ""The Commissioner said that, ""We are working on the negotiation texts and on the implementation of the agreement, but the date for implementing it will be **January 1st, 2020**"""". 

The question asks what Albert Muchanga was focusing on in terms of the *timing* of the agreement. The text explicitly mentions the date of implementation. The other options are related to the *processes* (negotiations, implementation) but not the specific date.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, pona nini mosala ekoki kobanda na sanza ya Sambo?","The correct answer is **A: Kobanda na Sanza ya Sambo ezalaki na kati ya boyokani oyo Nigeria epesaki pona kokota na AfCFTA**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Nigeria and AfCFTA are negotiating a long-term agreement.
* The statement ""Toyokani naino mibeko ya ebandeli pe ya kondima kokitisa talo"" refers to the negotiation process.
* The text then says the agreement is expected to be finalized by January 1st, 2020.

Therefore, the reason the signing is expected on January 1st is directly linked to the ongoing negotiations for the AfCFTA agreement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esika ya mibeko mpe ya boyokani ezali malamu:**  While the negotiations are complex, the text doesn't specify the complexity as the *reason* for the January 1st date.
* **C: Endimamaki na Biro ya AU pona mae matali Mombongo mpe Industri:** The text mentions the AU and Albert Muchange, but it doesn't say the decision comes from the Bureau for Agriculture and Industry.
* **D: Mibeko ya ebandeli mpe kokitisa talo esi endimami:** The text says the negotiations are ongoing (esi endimami), but it doesn't say that *that's* the reason for the January 1st date.

"Kolanda maloba wana, zulunalu ya mibeko ya Atlanta ekutaki mikonzi ya Education na mbeba nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kosimba raport ya zulunalu ya mibeko ya Atlanta (Reviewing the Atlanta Public Schools report)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Atlanta Public Schools district released a report that showed a significant number of test results were inaccurate. The question asks what action the Atlanta Public Schools district took in response. The passage explicitly mentions they *released* the report.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kozanga komema makambo ya sika na Education Urbain (To take action with Urban Education):**  While there *might* be connections to urban education, the passage doesn't directly link the response to that specific area.
* **C: Kozanga kosala eloko na makambo ya kati oyo emonanaki (To do something with the middle ground that is apparent):** This is too vague and not supported by the text.
* **D: Kopesa nsago to resulta ya ba ekzame ya mibeko (To release the results of the school tests):** The passage already states that the results *were* released, but the *problem* was the inaccuracy of those results. The district's action was to *report on* the problem, not just release the flawed data.



"
"Kolanda bansango oyo epesami na maloba wana, nini oyo elobamaki te na raport ya zulunalu ya mibeko ya Atlanta?","The correct answer is **A: Mbongwana ya malamu te na resulta ya ekzame (Lack of credibility in the exam results)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Atlanta school district's credibility was damaged due to concerns about exam results.  The reports questioned the validity of the results, implying they were not trustworthy.
* The passage mentions investigations, accusations of tampering with exams, and the firing of administrators. This all points to a lack of confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the exam results.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bilembetele emonisi ete babebisaki mikanda ya ekzame (The investigation showed that exams were falsified):** While the investigation *did* reveal some wrongdoing (tampering), the central problem wasn't just the falsification itself. The bigger issue was the *lack of credibility* in the results *regardless* of the falsification. The passage highlights the concern that the results were not accurate even *before* the falsification was revealed.
* **C: Molongi ya “National Superintendent of the Year” na mbula 2013 (Awarded ""National Superintendent of the Year"" in 2013):** This is irrelevant to the issue of exam results and the lack of credibility.
* **D: Batoli pona kokolisa lisusu Education Urbain (They were working to revive Education Urbain):** This is also irrelevant to the main concern about exam results and the resulting loss of credibility.



Therefore, the core message is that the reports questioned the *credibility* of the exam results, and the investigations revealed some degree of manipulation.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nsango nini eyebani na mae matali Bomb?","The correct answer is **B: Bandako nini Bombi epasukaki penepene na yango (What is the extent of the damage Bombi is causing?).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Babombe misato mosusu epanzanaki pene ya bandako ya boyekoli na eleko ya bangonga mibale."" This means the bombs are causing significant damage.
* **The passage also presents conflicting reports:** The official report says 30 people died, but the local population claims a higher number.
* **The question asks:** ""nsango nini eyebani na mae matali Bomb?"" (What is the extent of the damage caused by Bombi?).

Option B directly addresses the *extent* or *scope* of the damage, which is precisely what the question is asking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Botangi ya suka ya baoyo bazoki (The possibility of their escape).** The passage doesn't mention anything about the bombs escaping.
* **C: Soki baBombi misusu ya kopasola ezalaki (If the Bombi are more numerous).** While the passage mentions more bombs, the focus isn't on their number but on the damage they're causing.
* **D: Talo ya Bawei oyo eyebani (The truth of the Bawei who reported).** The passage highlights the discrepancy in reports, but doesn't ask for the truth of a particular report.



"
"Kobanda akomaki na Manchester City na mbula 2017, ba matches boni Jesus asili kobeta?","The correct answer is **A: 24**.

The question asks how many matches Jesus played for Manchester City *before* moving to Palmeiras. The text states he played 53 matches for Manchester City and scored 24 goals.  Since he moved in 2017, the 24 goals are associated with his time at Manchester City.

Therefore, the answer is 24.
"
Na Club nini Jesus azuaki lifuti ya £27 millio pona kokota?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The question states: ""Basombaki ye na mosolo bamilio 27£ pona kokota na Palmeiras..."" which translates to ""They signed him for £27 million to join Palmeiras...""
"
Maloba nini na mae matali bapaya ya hotel ezali yasolo te?,"The correct answer is **C: Bapaya bazalaki wana pona “eve of Hajj”**.

Here's why:

* The text states the hotel is full because many Muslims are arriving in Mecca *before* starting the Hajj pilgrimage. ""Eve of Hajj"" refers to the days immediately preceding the start of the Hajj rituals.
* Option A is true, but doesn't explain *why* they are all in Mecca right now.
* Option B is not mentioned in the text.
* Option D is a restatement of a point already made and doesn't explain the reason for the overcrowding.



Therefore, option C best explains why the hotel is so full – it's the period leading up to the start of the Hajj."
"Kolanda maloba wana, liloba nini na mae malandi ezali yasolo?","The correct answer is **C: Bapaya bazalaki wana pona botamboli pona kotala eve of hajj (Pilgrimage to Hajj)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndako wana ezalaki na bandimi mingi ya baMizilma ekweaki na 10 h lelo na ntongo. Ndako wana ezalaki na bandimi mingi ya baMizilma ekweaki na 10 h lelo na ntongo.

"Kolanda maloba wana, nsango nini na mae matali aksida eyebani malamu te ?","The correct answer is **A: Monene ya kopanzana (Very significant)**.

The text states that scientists believe this collision is ""ya makasi mpenza"" which translates to ""very significant"" or ""very important"".  The passage also highlights that the US government is monitoring the situation and will publish the results. This emphasizes the significance of the event.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini esengeli kosalema na mae matali aksida?","The correct answer is **C: Rapore ya botali ekopesama lolenge nini?** (What information does the report provide?)

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the report's findings.** The core of the passage is about the satellite's data and the scientific community's interest in understanding the impact of the oxygen. The report is what contains the details about how significant the oxygen is and its potential effects.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Nani akolandela boluki ya bitika?** (Who is following the progress?) While the passage mentions NASA is monitoring, the main point isn't *who* is following but *what* they are following - the report's findings.
* **B: Satelite ezalaki kotambola na vitesi nini na tango ya aksida?** (What speed was the satellite traveling during the oxygen event?) This is a detail mentioned, but it's not the central question the passage wants us to consider.  The speed is just a fact about the satellite's operation.
* **D: Makasi penza ya aksida** (The exact amount of oxygen)  The passage *doesn't* state the exact amount of oxygen. It says scientists are trying to *figure out* how significant it is.



Therefore, the question ""Rapore ya botali ekopesama lolenge nini?"" directly addresses the main subject of the passage – understanding the findings of the report about the oxygen."
"Kolanda maloba wana,Batten azalaki na esika nini na liste ya bato ya Mosolo mingi na Amerike?","The correct answer is **C: Esika ya 190**.

The question explicitly states: ""Batiaki Batten na esika ya 190 na liste ya bato ya Amerika 400 baza na mosolo mingi koleka na mobu 2008..."" which translates to ""Batiaki Batten is ranked 190th on the list of 400 wealthiest Americans...""
"
Na mae malandi Batten akabaki mosolo na esika nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Liste ya ba Ameriken ya mosolo ebele (A list of the wealthiest Americans)**.

The text states: ""Batiaki Batten na esika ya 190 na liste ya bato ya Amerika 400 oyo baza na mosolo mingi koleka na mobu 2008..."" which translates to ""Batiaki Batten is ranked 190th on the list of 400 wealthiest Americans...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Universite ya Virginie (University of Virginia):**  While he got a degree there, the question asks about his *ranking* on the wealth list, not his educational institution.
*   **C: Na Ba Biro ebele (In many offices):** The text doesn't mention this.
*   **D: Baninga naye ya Arts mpe Siansi (His studies in Arts and Sciences):**  While he earned a degree in this field, the question asks about his *ranking*, not his area of study.



"
Nini ezali te na kati ya mobeko oyo Gouvernere Arnold Schwarzenegger abimisaki,"The correct answer is **C: Kopekisa koteka to kodefisa bana mike masano ya video ya mobulu libanda ya Etuka Californi** (To prosecute or fine minors who make or distribute child pornography within the state of California).

Here's why:

* **The question asks what Arnold Schwarzenegger *didn't* do.** The prompt explicitly states he *ordered* the prosecution or fining of minors involved in making or distributing child pornography within California.
* **Option A** is too broad. The prompt doesn't say he ordered prosecution statewide, just within California.
* **Option B** is incorrect. The prompt says the penalty is $1000 *for the minors involved*. It doesn't say he's imposing fines on them.
* **Option D** is not mentioned in the prompt. He doesn't issue permits for adult video production.



Therefore, the only action he *didn't* take, according to the text, is to prosecute/fine those involved *outside* of California.  Since the prompt focuses on California, Option C is the most accurate negation of what he did."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani azangaki koyoka makambo oyo elobamaki?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The text states: ""Miller alobaki, """"Mike azoloba mingi na ntango bazosambisa...nazalaki kobongama yango wana nazalaki koyoka mpenza te makambo azalaki koloba."""""" This translates to: ""Miller said, """"Mike talks a lot about them being delivered... I'm getting tired of it and I'm not listening to what he's saying anymore.""""  Therefore, Miller is the one who is getting tired and not listening to what Mike is saying."
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezali yasolo kolanda experience ya Miller na Esambiselo ?","The correct answer is **D: Azalaki koyoka malamu makambo ya Duvall** (He is very worried about what Duvall is saying).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Miller alobaki, """"Mike azoloba mingi na ntango bazosambisa...nazalaki kobongama yango wana nazalaki koyoka mpenza te makambo azalaki koloba."""" ""  This translates to: ""Miller said, """"Mike talks a lot about the harvest...I am worried about it, that's why I am very afraid of what he is saying."""" ""

* **The key word is ""koyoka"" (to be afraid).**  Miller isn't just worried; he's *afraid*. This indicates a strong negative reaction and a sense of apprehension about Duvall's pronouncements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Duvall alobaki eloko pona Miller na ngonga ya kosamba** (Duvall said something to Miller about the harvest):  This is true, but it doesn't explain Miller's reaction. It just states what Duvall said.
* **B: Azalaki koyoka te na tango azalaki komilengela** (He is not afraid of what he is preaching about): This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **C: Bana mibale ya Duvall bazalaki koloba ebele na ngonga ya kosamba** (Duvall's children are talking a lot about the harvest): This information isn't present in the passage.  The passage focuses on Miller's reaction.



Therefore, option D accurately captures the sentiment expressed in Miller's words: he is very fearful of Duvall's statements.

Nani apesaki toli ete “mobeko ya kobatela mopepe” esengeli kobongolama?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The text states: ""nsima ya likita ya miniti 25 ya mokolo ya mibale elongo na mokonzi ya NDP Jack Layton na biro ya premier ministre. Layton asengaki babongola mobeko etali kobatela mopepe..."" which translates to ""after 25 minutes on the afternoon of the 16th with NDP leader Jack Layton at the Prime Minister's office. Layton demanded that the investigation into the air pollution be launched...""

Nani aboyaki kondima ete “mobeko ya Kobatela mopepe” bazalaki kosalela yango lokola lisano liboso ya maponami?,"The correct answer is **A: Mikonzi ya Boyangeli (Federal Agencies)**.

This translates to: ""Federal agencies contributed funds to the Mersey and Devonport hospital in Tasmania, and federal government and multiple federal deputies criticized the initiative, saying it would undermine federal funds that are constantly needed for other things.""

Therefore, it was the **federal agencies** (represented by the federal government and deputies) who criticized the ""airbridge initiative"" for undermining other necessary federal funds.

Biteni ya cyanuric acid na melamine tango esangani na masuba ya niau esalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Bacrystaux**.

The text states: ""Bato basalaki bolukiluki balobi ete mabanga esalemaki na masuba ya niau ndenge babakisaki melamine mpe na aside cyanuricque. Biloko esali bacristaux wana eza ndenge moko na oyo bamonaki na masuba ya banyama oyo babokolaka oyo babelaki ntango balekisaki yango na infrarouge (FTIR).""

This translates to: ""Scientists have discovered that the causes of the contamination in animal feed are melamine and cyanuric acid. These crystals are the same ones found in the tissues of animals that have died after being exposed to it, which were detected using infrared (FTIR).""

Therefore, the crystals are the resulting form of the melamine and cyanuric acid combination in the animal tissues.
"
Baluki basalelaki Infrarouge pona kotala nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba crystaux na masuba ya Niau**.

The text states: ""Bato basalaki bolukiluki balobi ete mabanga esalemaki na masuba ya niau ndenge babakisaki melamine mpe na aside cyanuricque. Bilioko esali bacristaux wana eza ndenge moko na oyo bamonaki na masuba ya banyama oyo babokolaka oyo babelaki ntango balekisaki yango na infrarouge (FTIR).""

This translates to: ""Scientists said that the cause of the contamination was in the feathers of the albatrosses because they had ingested melamine and cyanuric acid. These crystals were the same as those found in the feathers of the birds that died when they were analyzed with infrared (FTIR).""

Therefore, the scientists used infrared analysis to identify the crystals present in the albatross feathers.

Nani abengaki Luna “Queen of Extreme”?,"The correct answer is **A: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels alobaki ete """"Luna azalaki ntina te neti ngai...mbala mosusu koleka...nalinga ye pe nakozanga ye...nakinisi aza na esika ya malamu."""""" This translates to: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels said """"Luna is not only mine...much more often...I am with her and I take care of her...she is in my care."""""" While he doesn't explicitly say he *named* her ""Queen of Extreme,"" his words imply a close and protective relationship, and contextually, he's the one who used the phrase. Tommy Dreamer said she was a ""lifetime queen of extreme,"" but Dustin's statement implies a more personal and intimate connection, fitting the title. Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the most likely to have used the phrase ""Queen of Extreme.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Xinhua** is the news source, not a commentator.
*   **C: Luna’s manager** is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Tommy Dreamer** said she was a ""lifetime queen of extreme"", he did not use the phrase ""Queen of Extreme.""

"
Nani abengaki Luna “moto ya ndege”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer alobaki """"Luna azalaki mokonzi mwasi ya liboso ya mindondo. Mokonzi na ngai ya liboso. Luna akufaki na butu ya basanza mibale. Likambo ya kokamwa neti kaka ye moko. Mwasi ya makasi."""" (Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna is the best winged creature. My best creature. Luna is made of the dust of stars. Only he can understand her. A very beautiful woman."")

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who called Luna ""moto ya ndege"" (winged creature).

Nini esalemaki te na shofere oyo azalaki na aksida?,"The correct answer is **B: Azokisaki moto moko te na kati ya ndako** (He didn't injure anyone inside the car).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Atako bato misato bazalaki na kati ya ndako ntango motuka etutaki yango, moto moko te azokaki."" (There were three people in the car when the accident happened, but no one was injured.)
* The question asks what *didn't* happen to the driver. The sentence clearly states the driver wasn't injured.
* Option B directly reflects this information: ""Azokisaki moto moko te na kati ya ndako"" means ""He didn't injure anyone inside the car.""  The text explicitly says no one was injured *inside* the car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Azokaki na moto:** The text explicitly states *no one* was injured. This is a true statement, not something that *didn't* happen.
* **C: Bamemaki ye na lopitalo moko na Great Yarmouth kouta lopitalo ya Cambridge:** The text says he was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth, and then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge. He *was* taken to more than one hospital.
* **D: Misala pona lisungi esungaki kolongola ye na mutuka naye:** The text mentions that the driver was distracted, but it *doesn't* say that the driver's distraction caused the accident. This option suggests a causal link not stated in the text.

Na mae matali lisano ya Rugby ya Afrique ya sudi nini ezalaki eloko ya kokamwisa te?,"The correct answer is **C: Mosala malamu mingi na ebandeli ya tournoi** (Strong tactical play during the tournament).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mayele na bango ya kobatela nsima, mayele ya kolekisa ndembo pe mosala na bango ya malamu na ekipe esalaki ete baleka basusu pe ezalaki polele ete bango nde ekipe ya makasi koleka.""  This translates to: ""Their ability to score tries, their ability to convert goals and their tactical play in team were the reason they were allowed to lose and it was hoped that they would be the strongest team.""

The phrase ""baleka basusu"" (were allowed to lose) implies that the South African team's tactical play during the tournament wasn't as strong as expected, leading to their loss. Therefore, it was the tactical play that was the weak point.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Mosala malamu ya Equipe** (Team tactical play): This is a general statement. The passage specifies that the tactical play *during the tournament* was the issue.
*   **B: Mayele ya kolekisa ndembo** (Ability to convert goals): The passage mentions ability to convert goals, but the overall focus is on tactical play, not just goal conversion.
*   **D: Mayele ya kobatela sima** (Ability to score tries): Similar to B, the passage mentions scoring tries, but the tactical play during the tournoi is the main concern.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, lisano ya Afrique ya sudi ebandaki kobonga na ngonga nini?","The correct answer is **A: Na Ngonga 10:00**.

The text states: ""Lisano ebandaki na 10h00..."" which translates to ""The match started at 10:00...""  Therefore, the match started at 10:00.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu te nkita ya Mobaka Chine?","The correct answer is **A: Mombongo Ya Chine ekoli makasi banda basalaki mbongwana ya nkita** (The Chinese government is very good at propaganda).

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily focuses on China's propaganda efforts to portray a strong and growing economy.** It emphasizes the narrative created by Deng Xiaoping and the repeated claim of China's economic prowess, even compared to Germany and the US.
* **The question asks what the statement *doesn't* imply about China's economic power.**  While the passage *claims* China's economic power is immense (high GDP, overtaking the US), it doesn't provide concrete, independent evidence to support this claim. It relies heavily on the *presentation* of this information.
* **Options B, C, and D are directly stated or heavily implied in the passage.**  The passage *says* China has a large economy, *claims* it will surpass the US in GDP, and *asserts* it's investing heavily in infrastructure.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the statement highlights the power of Chinese propaganda and doesn't necessarily reflect verifiable economic reality.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na tango nini PIB ya Chine ekokaki koleka ya Amerike?","The correct answer is **B: Na kati bambula tuku mibale** (Within the next few decades).

Here's why:

The text states: ""PIB ya Chine ekoki koleka ya États-Unis nsima ya mibu tuku mibale."" This directly translates to ""China's GDP could surpass that of the United States within the next few decades.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kolanda Mbongwana ebele ya nkita** (Due to its large population): While China's large population is a factor in its economic growth, the text focuses on the *timing* of surpassing the US, not just the population's influence.
* **C: Tango Mboka ezali nase ya kibokonzi ya sika** (When the world becomes more democratic): The text doesn't mention democracy as a factor in China's potential GDP growth.
* **D: Na kati ya bambula tuku misato** (Within the next few years): The text specifically says *decades*, not years.



"
Lolenge nini Hu alendisaki mikili ya bobola ?,"The correct answer is **D: Koboya banzela ya kala ya mabe**.

The text states: """"Alendisaki mikili ya bobola """"na koboya kolanda nzela ya kala ya kobebisa naino mpe kopetola na nsima."""" This translates to: ""He expressed great concern about going down the wrong path of developing and relying on it.""  ""Koboya kolanda nzela ya kala ya kobebisa naino mpe kopetola na nsima"" means ""going down the wrong path of developing and relying on it."" This aligns with option D.

The other options are not supported by the text:

* **A: Kozua mikumba oyo epusi fase na bango ya kokoba** (making things very difficult for them to develop): The text doesn't mention hindering their development.
* **B: Kotalela mingi mingi bambuna nini nkita ekobota** (paying a lot of attention to what the country is doing): The text doesn't mention paying attention to China's actions.
* **C: Koleka makoki na bango ya ngonga oyo** (forcing their ability with this new thing): The text doesn't mention forcing anything.



"
Nini elobamaki na Hu te?,"The correct answer is **B: Malendisi na bamboka ya bobola na mae matali kobebisa mopepe**.

Here's why:

The text states that Hu ""alendisaki mikili ya bobola """"na koboya kolanda nzela ya kala ya kobebisa naino mpe kopetola na nsima."""" (He expressed great concern about continuing the old ways of burning it and relying on it). This clearly indicates that Hu is warning against the environmental consequences of continued carbon dioxide emissions and the need to find alternative solutions.  The phrasing ""malendisi na bamboka ya bobola"" (expressing great concern/worry) aligns perfectly with his statement about the dangers of the current path.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bantina ya kokata (Trading practices):**  The text doesn't discuss trading practices.
* **C: Mokolo oyo bobimisi carbone dioxyde ekosila (The day carbon dioxide is emitted):**  The text focuses on the *consequences* of carbon dioxide emission, not a specific day.
* **D: Talo ya kokitisa kobimisa carbone dioxyde (The problem of increasing carbon dioxide emission):** While increasing emissions is a problem, Hu's statement goes beyond just identifying the problem; it's about expressing worry about the *continuing* emission and the need to change course.



"
"Na oyo elandi, Veerman alobaki ete makambo ezali mabe na ntina ya nini?","The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The text states that Richard Veerman said ""Angola ezokende na mpasi ya makasi koleka pe makambo eza kaka mabe mingi Angola,"" which translates to ""Angola is going to be much worse and things are really very bad in Angola.""
"
"Sima ya bosambi , nani akozua mosala ya Huhne na Cabinet?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**. 

The text states: ""Huhne atiki mosala ye moko mpe **Ed Davey nde akozwa esika na ye ya mosala na Cabinet**."" (Huhne resigned and Ed Davey was called to replace him in the Cabinet.)



"
Nani akozua Mosala ya Ministre ya mombongo mokolo moko liboso ya esambiselo?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Tozozela ete Norman Lamb andima kozala ministre des Affaires na esika ya Davey."" This translates to ""It is expected that Norman Lamb will be the Minister of State in Davey's place.""
"
Ba Artistes bayebisaki bafan kosala nini na tango ya “Opera Camile Saint-Saen”?,"The correct answer is **D: Kotika bamoi nabango etambwisama na oyo balingi**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Camille Saint-Saens was an artist whose ""greatness was rooted in a love of languages and Japan.""
* It then says that because of this, the organizers arranged for the theatre performance to allow the audience to connect and understand each other.  This implies a focus on communication and shared understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komeka komela Bangi (Imitate Japan):**  While Japan influenced her, the text doesn't explicitly say the audience was meant to *imitate* Japanese culture.
* **B: Kosala mobembo na Japon (Perform extravagantly in Japan):** The text doesn't mention performances *in* Japan.
* **C: Komata na podium elongo na bango (Appear on stage with them):**  The text doesn't mention audience members appearing on stage.

Therefore, the best interpretation of the text is that the performance aimed to facilitate connection and understanding between the audience and the artist (or the themes presented).  This aligns with option D.
"
Nani amelaki Bangi liboso na tango ya “Opera”?,"The correct answer is **C: Basani**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Basani bamelaka mbangi ntango bazosala teyatre..."" which translates to ""The critics were interested even when they were going to do theater...""
* The passage emphasizes that the theater allowed people to connect. 
* The question asks *who* were interested in the ""Opera"" (which is being discussed in the context of the theater production). The passage clearly identifies the critics as being interested.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Basani (Critics)**.



"
Kombo mosusu ya “spacewalk” oyo Leonv asalaki ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Extravehicular activity**.

The text explicitly states that Leonov performed an Extravehicular Activity (EVA), which is another term for a spacewalk. While the other options are related to the context, they are not the *type* of activity Leonov performed. The question asks for the *name* of the spacewalk, and the text directly identifies it as an EVA."
Leonov akambaki ba Soviet pona mission nini?,"The correct answer is **A: The Space Race**.

The text states: ""Mibu zomi na nsima, akambaki eteni ya mosala ya Union Soviétique, Apollo-Soyouz oyo ezalaki elembo ya suka mbangu na likolo."" This translates to ""Many years later, he participated in the Union Soviet mission, Apollo-Soyuz, which was a symbol of friendship in space.""  The Apollo-Soyuz mission was a direct result of the Space Race between the US and the Soviet Union. While Leonov's EVA was a significant event, the question asks *why* he eventually participated in a later mission, and that was as part of the evolving relationship that culminated in Apollo-Soyuz, a key part of the Space Race's ending.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Apollo-Soyuz:** This is *where* he participated, not the reason he went in the first place.
* **C: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is a description of who he is, not the reason for a mission.
* **D: EVA:** This is the specific event he's known for, not the overall reason for later mission participation.



"
Nani azokaki na aksida?,"The correct answer is **D: Mokumbi mituka ya minene**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mokumbi motuka, azokaki te na aksida wana."" This translates to ""The elderly woman, she didn't have that accident."" 

Later, the witness from the garage says: ""Ezalaki na bana oyo bazalaki kozela kokatisa nzela pe bango nyonso bazalaki kotia makelele pe kolela."" This translates to ""It's the children who were trying to fix the car and all of them were shouting and screaming.""

Therefore, the children (mokumbi mituka ya minene) are the ones who got injured in the accident.  Gibson was taken to the hospital *because* of the accident, but the question asks *who* got injured.



"
Nini esalemaki na bato oyo bazalaki na aksida?,"The correct answer is **D: Bango nyonso mibale bazokaki** (They all died).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Bango nyonso bazokaki nsima longwa na esika aksida esalemaki."" This translates to ""They all died soon after the accident occurred.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakufaki bango nyonso mibale** (They all died quickly) - While technically true, ""nsima longwa"" (soon after) implies a relatively quick death, but ""mibale"" (quickly) is less precise and doesn't capture the meaning as accurately as ""bazokaki"" (died).
* **B: Moko azokaki, moko akufaki** (One survived, one died) - The text explicitly says ""Bango nyonso bazokaki"" - they *all* died.
* **C: Bazalaki koganga mpe kolela** (They were fighting and screaming) - This describes what someone *witnessed* at the scene, but doesn't describe what happened *to the people in the accident*.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and complete answer based on the provided text."
Bato ya siansi oyo bazalaki kosala na programe wana bazalaki kotia elekia ya komona ba effets ya nini na mae malandi?,"The correct answer is **C: Biteni ya mikie mikie** (Microwave emissions).

Here's why:

The passage states that the program is designed to look for effects of **microwave emissions** caused by the collision of the Milky Way and the Sagittarius galaxy. It specifically mentions that the collision is causing distortions in the galaxy and that the resulting wave patterns, particularly in microwaves, are a key area of study.  The passage connects the collision to changes in the microwave background radiation.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Biloko mosusu** (Other things): This is too vague. The passage focuses specifically on microwave emissions.
*   **B: Ba mbonge ya Makasi** (Dark Matter): While the passage mentions dark matter, the program isn't primarily designed to study dark matter directly. The collision and its effects on microwave emissions are the focus.
*   **D: Biloko ya moindo** (Ordinary matter): While ordinary matter is involved in the collision, the program is designed to detect *effects* of the collision, specifically microwave emissions, which are a result of interactions between ordinary matter and the changing gravitational field.



"
"Bato ya siansi bazalaki kotalela biloko ya nini na ,mae malandi?","The correct answer is **D: The Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way**.

The passage states: ""Bato ya siansi balobaki ete eloko wana ya moindo eza na bopusi na eloko mosusu ya moindo kaka ndenge biloko mosusu esalaka. Likanisi wana elobaka ete biloko mingi ya moindo oyo eza zingazinga ya galaxie ezalaka zingazinga ya galaxie neti mwa halo moko, pe ezalaka na biloko ebele ya mikemike."" This translates to: ""Scientists believe that this phenomenon is only similar to other phenomena in the universe. This hypothesis suggests that much of the matter in the galaxy is concentrated in a halo-like structure, and it contains a lot of dark matter.""

The passage then goes on to say that the Mosalaki (the hypothetical aliens) built programs to study the Sagittarius galaxy. The scientists are studying the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way (our galaxy) because the Mosalaki's programs focused on those two galaxies.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bato ya Party Conservatives bazali koseka te eloko nini?","The correct answer is **B: Kozanga makoki ya kotonga (Trying to gain power)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Conservatives are trying to capitalize on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and use it to undermine the Bush administration and gain political advantage. The phrases ""kosalela badepanse ya kosilisa bato"" (exploiting the expenses of saving people) and ""kotonga lisusu bandako nsima ya mopepe makasi Katrina"" (taking advantage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina) clearly indicate a power grab.  They are using the disaster as an opportunity to strengthen their own position.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ndenge ya kosalela lisungi (The way to manage things):** While the Conservatives might criticize the government's response, the core intent is power, not just better management.
*   **C: Nani akozua contrat pona kotonga lisusu (Who is signing a contract to take power):**  The passage doesn't mention contracts. The focus is on exploiting the situation for political gain.
*   **D: Depense ya kotonga lisusu (The expenses of taking power):** While there are expenses involved, the passage is about the *goal* of taking power, not the cost.



"
Nani azali koseka bacontrat ya lisungi pona kotonga lisusu Hurricane Katrina?,"The correct answer is **A: Babateli likita ya makambo makasi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bato mosusu ya leta oyo batalelaka nkita ya leta ya makambo makasi babengaki yango na ndenge ya kosekisa """"Boyokani ya Bush na Nouvelle-Orléans."""""".  This translates to: ""Many people in the government who were not affiliated with the Bush administration were inclined to criticize the 'Bush response in New Orleans.'""

The question asks *who* is criticizing the contracts. The sentence directly identifies it as those *not* affiliated with the Bush administration, which is the same as the people who were criticizing the Bush administration's response. This refers to those in the ""likita ya makambo makasi"" (the government's administration).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba Liberales (Liberals):** The text mentions liberals as a group who were against the government's actions, but doesn't say they are *criticizing the contracts*.
* **C: Bush:** The text mentions the Bush response being criticized, not that Bush himself is criticizing the contracts.
* **D: Bato ya kati ya Washington (People in the middle of Washington):** This is too vague. The text is more specific about those *not* aligned with the Bush administration.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, mwinda kouta mpepo ya vitesi Stardust ekomonana yambo na esika nini?","The correct answer is **B: Northern California**.

The text states: ""Stardust ekoleka na weste ya Californie ya nordi..."". This translates to ""Stardust flies in Northern California..."".  While it passes through other states, the starting point mentioned is Northern California.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Mpepo ya vitesi ekosala record ya nini na mae malandi?","The correct answer is **C: Kozonga na mabele mbangu mingi** (Traveling at a very high speed).

The passage states: ""Stardust ekosala record ya sika ya kozala mpepo ya vitese koleka ezonga na Mabele, ebuki record ya kala oyo batiaki na sanza ya mitano 1969 ntango Apollo X azongaki na mabele.""  This translates to ""Stardust sets a new record for the fastest wind speed than ever recorded in the atmosphere, surpassing the record set in 1969 during Apollo X."" The passage further clarifies that this speed allows travel from Northern California to Los Angeles in just one minute.

Therefore, the record is for traveling at a very high speed.
"
Lolenge nini Dr. Malar Balasubramanian ayebanaki na Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Maman moboti (Mother)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kuna, bamonaki ebembe ya Saroja Balasubramanian, mibu 53, bazipi yango babulangeti etondi na makila."" which translates to ""There, they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53 years old, wrapped in a blanket."" This implies that Saroja Balasubramanian is Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother.
"
Ebembe ya Balasubramanian ezuamaki wapi?,"The correct answer is **B: Pemebeni ya nzela**.

The text states: ""...alali na mopanzi ya nzela na polo pe ba sous-vêtements..."" which translates to ""...was found in the middle of the road in polo and underwear...""
"
EBay esombaki nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Zoom**. 

The question states that the company is known to be bigger than those on eBay and that it facilitates communication with many locations, including China, Europe, and Brazil. This description perfectly fits Zoom. While Skype is mentioned, the context implies a larger, more globally impactful company.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
EBay ezali koluka kosala nini na bosombi oyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Komatisa koyebana naye** (Facilitating communication with them).

Here's why:

* The text states that eBay is providing tools for communication and collaboration, specifically mentioning Skype as a key tool. 
* The core function being facilitated is *communication* and working together effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kokembisa matomba naye** (Helping them create items): While eBay *might* help with listing items, the primary focus of the text is on communication.
* **B: Kokoma na bisika misusu** (Being in multiple locations):  This is a consequence of facilitating communication, not the direct action eBay is taking.
* **D: Kosepelisa baclients naye** (Connecting them with clients):  Communication is a *means* to connect with clients, but the text emphasizes the tools for interaction, not just the connection itself.



"
"Kolanada maloba wana, nani asololaki te na bakangami oyo batikalaki na lopango sima ya etumba?","The correct answer is **D: Basali ya lopitalo (Hospital staff)**.

Here's why:

The text describes hospital staff responding to a call for help from people trapped under rubble. The passage specifically mentions ""bato oyo babomaka moto"" (people who rescued the person) and ""bato oyo babomaki yango na 11:35 ya butu"" (people who rescued them at 11:35).  These people are the hospital staff.
"
Na mae malandi nini etindaki bakangami kotika kotomboka?,"The correct answer is **B: Milinga ya kopanza bato (The emergency siren)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bakamgami baninga oyo bazokaki na milinga oyo epanzaka bato.""  This translates to ""...the emergency siren which announces people who can help.""  The siren is what alerts people to the emergency and calls for help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Masolo elekaki malamu (The sun is shining brightly)** - This is irrelevant to the scenario.
* **C: Bakamgami baninga oyo bazokaki (The rescuers who can help)** - While rescuers are involved, the question asks *what* triggered the rescuers to come.
* **D: Moto moko (One person)** - The siren is a device, not a single person.



"
"Na emoneli ya Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s , mboka Iran esengeli komitiya mpole yango moko na eloko nini?","The correct answer is **B: Botomboki ya Islam (the Islamic Revolution)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei alobaki ete ndenge bazalaka na mposa makasi mpenza ya essence eza """"motambu"""" oyo euta banda na botomboki ya Bamizilma ya Iran na 1979 mpe mboka esengeli kolongwa na nse na yango.""  This translates to: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the current scarcity of gasoline is a ""threat"" that could lead to the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and that the oil must be managed by the religious authorities.""

Therefore, he associates the current gasoline shortage with the potential for a repeat of the 1979 revolution, implying that the religious authority (and by extension, the Islamic ideology) needs to control the oil situation.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bipekiseli ya mbongo (Oil reserves):** While oil reserves are relevant, Khamenei's statement focuses on the *potential consequences* of the shortage, not just the reserves themselves.
*   **C: Mbongo kouta Libanda (Oil exports):**  The text mentions oil exports but isn't the central point of Khamenei's concern.
*   **D: Kotalela essence (Gathering gasoline):** This is a specific action, not the larger ideological concern that Khamenei expresses.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani andimaki ba effets ya bipekiseli na mbongo ya Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Bakonzi**.

The text states: ""Bakomantere, en direct na televizio, ezalaki mbala ya liboso bakonzi ya Iran bandimaki ete bitumbu ezalaka kopesa bango mpasi."" This translates to ""Officials, live on television, repeatedly announced that sanctions are stopping them from exporting oil.""
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, na esika nini kotala ndako monene ekoki kozala mobembo ya congé oyo ezali na ntina?","The correct answer is **C: Na lobwaku ya Rhin**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions ""lobwaku ya Loire, ya Rhin to kokende na masuwa na bisika ya kitoko na Danube"". This directly links the river Rhine to potential vacation destinations.
* Option A (Danube) is mentioned, but the question asks about where to go for a *long* vacation. While the Danube is a significant river, the text presents the Rhine, Loire, and Danube as examples of rivers for extended travel.
* Option B (Canal Erie) is mentioned as a place for ""bato ya makolo pe bavelo"" (families and tourists), which is a possible type of vacation, but not necessarily a ""long"" or extensive one in the same way as a major river cruise.
* Option D (any water route) is too broad and doesn't align with the specific examples given in the text.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **C: Na lobwaku ya Rhin**."
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, kati na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala toli oyo esɛngami te mpo na basi oyo bazali kosala mibembo na esika yango?","The correct answer is **B: Yeba ete bokeseni ya mimeseno ekoki kotinda bato ya mboka bázala na bizaleli ya makasi (Because the dust can make local people very ill).**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Bokeseni ya mimeseno ekoki kobimisa eloko oyo babengaki kotungisa pe esalemaka mbala mingi ete balanda bango, basimba bango na maboko, pe bongo na bongo."" (Dust can compromise the work they are doing and often cause them to cough, choke, and suffer.)
* **This directly relates to the question:** The question asks what danger is *not* necessary for people doing fieldwork in that region. The text clearly shows that dust poses a significant danger, making option B the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bokima kolobela ezalela ya libala (Good hygiene prevents disease).** While good hygiene is generally good, the text emphasizes the danger of dust, which isn't necessarily prevented by just good hygiene.
* **C: Boya kolata biloko ya motuya oyo ezali kongenga (Avoid touching contaminated things).** The text mentions people often touch contaminated things (coughing, choking) due to the dust. Avoiding contact is a general good practice, but doesn't address the core danger highlighted in the text.
* **D: Salelá makasi soki esengeli (Be very careful if necessary).** This is a general suggestion and doesn't pinpoint a specific danger that is *not* necessary.



"
"Na kotalela esika oyo mokapo yango elobeli, toli nini ekozala malamu mpo na basi oyo bazali kosala mibembo?","The correct answer is **D: Na likambo ya bokóli oyo olingi te, zalá ngwi na koboya mibali**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the danger of snakes.** It specifically states ""Zala makasi na koboya mibali"" which translates to ""It is very important to avoid snakes.""
* **The question asks what is crucial for those who are hunting.**  Avoiding snakes directly contributes to their safety while hunting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeba ete ezali likambo ya momeseno te ete bálanda yango (It's not a matter of luck whether they are bitten).**  The passage *does* imply luck plays a role (you can be bitten even if you're careful).  It's not saying it's *never* luck.
* **B: Lata lopetemoko monene mpo na komonisa ezalela ya libala (It's very important to coordinate movements with others).** While coordination can be helpful, the passage doesn't highlight it as a primary safety concern.
* **C: Sosola ete bokeseni ya mimeseno ezali kolakisa ete oboya kotelema na esika na yo (Be aware that snake danger forces you to be careful about where you step).** While awareness is good, the passage focuses on avoiding snakes themselves, not just being careful about stepping.



Therefore, avoiding snakes (koboya mibali) is the most crucial piece of advice for hunters in this environment.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, likambo nini ekoki kosɛnga moto oyo azwaka ba foto ya banyama ya zamba asalela zoom moko ya sipesiale?","The correct answer is **D: Soki parc moko ezali na mibeko ya sipesiale oyo etali kokanga ba foto ya banyama ya zamba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbala mingi mpona kokanga bafoto ya banyama esengaka kozala na zoom ya molai, kasi biloko neti etuluku ya bandeke to ya bikelamu mosusu ya mike esengaka zoom ya ndenge mosusu. Ezalaka mpasi na kozwa banyama mingi oyo eutaka na bamboka mosusu mpe ntango mosusu baparke baza na mibeko etali kokanga bafoto mpona ntina ya mombongo.""

This means national parks often have special regulations and infrastructure *specifically* designed for wildlife photography. This would likely include things like designated areas, special permits, and potentially even tools (like specific types of zoom lenses) that are allowed or encouraged.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Soki bazo photographier mingi-mingi banyama mike:** While photographing many animals is common, it doesn't inherently require a special zoom.
* **B: Soki bazali kosalela bafoto yango mpo na mombongo:**  Photographing for scientific purposes *might* lead to specific requirements, but it's not the primary reason for special zoom regulations.
* **C: Soki banyama oyo bazali kokanga bango foto bazali na nsoni:**  Whether the animals are shy or not doesn't directly dictate the need for a special zoom lens.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo yango lokola mokakatano oyo ekoki kozala mpo na bato oyo bazwaka ba foto ya banyama ya zamba?","The best answer is **C: Koluka lolenge ya ba objectifs oyo esengeli (Understand the lens capabilities)**. Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding lens zoom.** It states that using excessive zoom can negatively impact image quality (blurring, loss of detail).
* **Option C directly addresses this:**  Understanding the lens's capabilities (its focal length, zoom range, and how it performs at different zoom levels) is crucial for taking good photos of wildlife. You need to know the limits of your lens to avoid poor results.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kozwa banyama mosusu ya mikili mosusu (Get closer to the animals):** While desirable, this isn't always possible or ethical.  It's a *solution* to a problem (lack of detail) but doesn't directly address the *technical* aspect of photo-taking.
* **B: Kosala na banyama oyo ezali na nkanda (Photograph animals that are in a group):**  Group shots can be good, but it's not a universal solution, and it doesn't address the technical challenges.
* **D: Kosala na bisika oyo ekoki kozala na banguna (Photograph in locations that can be hidden):**  Camouflage is important for not disturbing the animals, but it doesn't solve the problem of getting sharp, detailed photos.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekobimisa mikakatano mingi te mpo na mokumbi motuka oyo azali koleka na nzela ya bangomba?","The correct answer is **B: Friction ya moke (High friction)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Na banzela oyo etondi na neige mpe glace, friction ezalaka mingi te mpo na motuka."" (In this case, on snow and ice, friction is very low for the motorcycle).

Therefore, the opposite of high friction, which is low friction, is what makes it difficult to steer a motorcycle on snow and ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mituka mingi (Much more difficulty):** The passage says it's *easier* to have trouble steering, not *more* difficult in terms of friction.
*   **C: Condensation eleki ndelo (Condensation occurs):** While condensation *might* occur, it isn't the primary reason for the difficulty in steering.
*   **D: Komona ekiti (Visibility is poor):** Poor visibility is a problem, but the core issue the passage addresses is the *lack of friction*.



"
Nini ekoki kotikala ndenge moko na oyo etali mpako ya bozwi na mikili ndenge na ndenge?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntalo (Age)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how Longola Kaka Soki, a diplomat, has a significant amount of baggage.  It specifically mentions that her luggage is often lost or delayed and that her belongings are scattered in different places. The passage points to the fact that she travels frequently to the US and Canada, which makes it difficult to keep track of everything.

The key reason for the chaotic state of her luggage, and therefore the most likely factor to influence the *type* of things in her luggage, is her **age**.  An older person, having traveled extensively over a long period, is more likely to accumulate a diverse and possibly disorganized collection of items.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ndenge eslaemi (How it's packed):** While packing style contributes to baggage issues, the passage doesn't emphasize how she packs. The issue is more about the sheer volume and history of the items.
* **C: Esika ozali kosala dossier (Where you're preparing the file):** This is irrelevant to the contents of the luggage.
* **D: Baparenthèse (Parentheses):** This is a grammatical element and has no connection to the luggage.

Therefore, **Age (Ntalo)** is the most logical reason for the nature of Longola Kaka Soki's baggage.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, soki ozali kosala na mikili ya bapaya kasi ozali na esika mosusu, mbala mosusu okokotisa mpako na yo ya mosolo wapi?","The correct answer is **A: Bisika nyonso oyo ozalaka mingimingi** (Everywhere you are frequently).

Here's why:

The prompt describes Longola kaka soki oza diplomate, always having to file taxes in multiple places. The key point is that diplomats frequently work in different locations. The question asks where you would file taxes if you're frequently in multiple places. Therefore, the answer is *everywhere you are frequently*.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Na États-Unis** (In the United States) - While the prompt mentions the US, it doesn't limit it to only the US.
* **C: Na mboka oyo ozali kosala sikoyo** (In the country where you are working) - Again, this is too narrow. The prompt implies frequent movement between multiple countries.
* **D: Bisika nionso ba frais ezali na se** (All expenses are on me) - This is irrelevant to where you file taxes.



"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola malamu te Foire mondiale?","The correct answer is **B: Ba expositions botaniques elakisami pembeni ya ba expositions artistiques mpe éducatives** (Botanical exhibitions are held alongside artistic and educational exhibitions).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Foire ya mokili mobimba eza fete monene ya makambo ya mayemi mpe ya siansi ya mikili mingi."" (The World Fair is a great celebration of art and agricultural science.) This indicates the fair includes both artistic and scientific/agricultural aspects.
* **The passage further explains:**  ""...Kolakisa bahorticoles ya mikili mingi ekoma milulu ya ntina mingi oyo elakisaka bafololo, bilanga ya kitoko mpe nyonso oyo etali banzete."" (...Improving large-scale agriculture involves a lot of innovation that brings seedlings, beautiful plants, and everything that is beneficial.)  This directly relates to botanical science.
* **Option B** accurately reflects the connection between botanical exhibitions and other types of exhibitions mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba expositions ekoki kolakisa histoire to culture ya mboka moko** (Exhibitions can showcase the history or culture of a single crop) - While potentially true, it's not the primary point the passage is making. The focus is on agriculture as a whole.
* **C: Makambo ekoki kowumela sanza motoba** (Things can be presented without a crowd) - The passage explicitly mentions large crowds attending.
* **D: Ba pays esengeli te ba participer** (Countries are not required to participate) - The passage describes the fair as a celebration and implies participation is expected.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali mobeko ya Foire mondiale to Exposition internationale?","The correct answer is **B: Mboka moko ekoki koyamba milulu yango mbula na mbula te**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes Foire ya mokili mobimba (International Agricultural Fair).** It talks about agricultural exhibitions, showcasing crops, plants, and agricultural innovations.
* **The question asks where the ""Foire mondiale"" or ""Exposition internationale"" (World Fair/International Exposition) is located within the description.**
* **The text explicitly states that these fairs are held annually (mbala moko na mbula).** 

Option B directly addresses the idea that a single country *cannot* produce everything required for a fair. International fairs involve participation from multiple nations, showcasing their unique contributions.  This is implied by the fair being described as ""mondiale"" or ""internationale"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba écrans esengeli kolakisa ezala histoire ya mboka moko mpe makambo ya mokili** (Screens must tell the story of a single country and the world). While World Fairs *can* showcase national stories, they aren't limited to it. Many displays focus on global trends and advancements.
* **C: Makambo masengeli kowumela kino sanza motoba** (Things must be presented without a roof). This is irrelevant to the location of the fair.
* **D: Mpo ete foire esalema, esengeli mikili nyonso esangana na yango** (For the fair to take place, all countries must participate). While many countries participate, the text doesn't imply that *all* countries *must* participate for the fair to exist.  It also doesn't directly relate to the fair's location.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical answer based on the provided text and the nature of international fairs."
Kosala oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ekokitisa likoki ya kobundisa banyama?,"The correct answer is **B: Kolongola bosoto na esika oyo batyaka kaa** (Clear the area where they gather).

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes the danger of the animals and the need to keep a safe distance.  It mentions the animals are large, dangerous, and potentially deadly.
* The core of the solution given in the passage is to prevent people from getting close to the animals in the first place. This directly relates to clearing the area where they gather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komemaka matiti ya nsolo kitoko** (Make loud noises): While making noise might *sometimes* deter animals, it's not the primary solution mentioned in the passage and isn't the safest or most reliable.
* **C: Kobatela bolai ya 25 yards na bambwa ya zamba** (Maintain a 25-yard distance from the river): The passage mentions a 25-meter distance from the river, but the focus is on preventing *any* close encounter with the animals, not just the river.
* **D: Kopekisa banyama na biloko ya kolya oyo etikali** (Feed the animals things they shouldn't):  The passage explicitly states that feeding the animals is a bad idea and contributes to them becoming habituated to humans, making them more dangerous.



Therefore, clearing the area where the animals gather is the most direct and appropriate answer based on the information given.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, nini elobami te lokola eloko ekoki kotinda banyama ya zamba basala yo mabe?","The correct answer is **B: Kozanga kobatela distance (Keeping distance)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Na kotalela bakonzi ya parke, zala mosika na 100 metele na bangombolo mpe bambwa ya zamba mpe 25 metele ya banyama misusu nyonso ya zamba!"" This means maintaining a significant distance is crucial for safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nsolo ya makasi (Extreme caution):** While caution is important, the text emphasizes *distance* as the primary safety measure.
* **C: Koleisa banyama ya zamba (Feeding the animals):** The text *explicitly forbids* feeding the animals, stating it encourages them to approach humans.
* **D: Banyama oyo bameseni na bato te (These animals are not aggressive towards people):** The text states the animals are *large, dangerous, and can be fatal*, directly contradicting this option.



"
Na mae malandi nini ezali te kati ya Vote ya mboka France?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba kitunga ya komonana na kati (The means of verification)**.

The text states: ""Na 1988, bisika ya kotia bulletin ya vote esengeli komonana na kati mpe na libanda mpo bato bazovote mpe batala bamona ete anvelopi moko te eza na kati ntango vote ezobanda mpe ete anvelopi moko te ebakisami kasi longola kaka ya bato batangi bango mpona komona makambo nyonso."" 

This translates to: ""In 1988, the means of verification of the vote had to match both at the polling station and at the office, so that voters could see that the envelope was inside when the vote was cast and that the envelope didn't open except by the person who cast it, allowing everyone to see everything.""

Therefore, the core issue was the **lack of a reliable verification system** to ensure the integrity of the vote, specifically whether the ballot paper was inside the envelope and hadn't been tampered with.
"
Esika nini bato ya kovoter batiaka kombo ya candidat na bango?,"The correct answer is **C: Na anvelope**.

The text explicitly states: ""batiaka yango na amvelope moko"" which translates to ""they put it in an envelope."" The question asks where voters put the candidate's ballot.
"
Nini etindaki Allen kobanda bolukiluki ya mbula mwambe pona Musashi?,"The correct answer is **B: Mposa naye na kolanda karte nase ya mai**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Soki endimisami, bokundoli ebakisa biloko ezangaki na bolukiluki ya mibu mwambe ya Allen mpona Musashi. **Bazwaki eloko ezindaki na lisalisi ya ROV moko.**"" (If it's successful, the team will use a multi-jointed arm designed by Allen for Musashi. **They will do what is needed using a ROV platform.**)

This indicates that Allen designed the multi-jointed arm, and the team will use a ROV to implement it.  Therefore, the team is helping Allen achieve this goal by providing the resources (the ROV).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bizui naye (Help him)** - While the team is helping, this isn't the *specific action* mentioned for enabling the multi-jointed arm.
* **C: Kotiya bozui naye na bolukiluki na Mai (Help him with the arm)** -  The text indicates the team will use a ROV, not directly help Allen with the arm itself.
* **D: Mposa naye na Etumba (Help him with materials)** - The text doesn't mention materials. It specifically mentions the use of a ROV platform.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Allen atiyaki bozui naye ebele na eloko nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kozongisa Musashi (Fixing Musashi)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Soki endimisami, bokundoli ebakisa biloko ezangaki na bolukiluki ya mibu mwambe ya Allen mpona Musashi."" This translates to ""If there's a problem, the team fixes things that are broken due to Allen's extensive work on Musashi.""  Therefore, the team is working to *fix* Musashi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bolukiluki na mai (Water leakage):**  The passage doesn't mention water leakage.
* **C: Kotonga ROV moko (Controlling the ROV):** The passage mentions using an ROV, but the focus isn't on controlling it. It's on fixing Musashi *with* the ROV.
* **D: Koyekola mae matali kolanda karte nase ya mai (Checking the front part of the card and the water):** This is not mentioned in the passage. The focus is on fixing the overall problem with Musashi.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ekokaki kotinda aksida elekana na kati mpe nzinganzinga ya mokili?","The correct answer is **A: Essence ya Iranium**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Na kotalela lisanga ya nikleyere ya Japon, bamonaki césium na iode ya radioactifs na izine. Bakonzi bakanisi ete ezolakisa ete bakontenere oyo ezalaki na **uranium** na esika wana, mbala mosusu epasuki pe ebandi kobima.""  This translates to: ""By analyzing the Japanese nickel layer, they found radioactive cesium and iodine in the ash. Officials stated that this was due to containers that contained **uranium**, which often decayed and released radiation.""
* **Uranium is the key element:**  The text directly links the radioactive decay and potential contamination to the presence of uranium. While cesium and iodine are radioactive, the underlying issue causing the problem is the uranium.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **Radioactif Cesium:** Cesium is radioactive but not the root cause of the problem according to the text.
    * **Mulinga ya pete (Petroleum ash):** The ash is petroleum ash, but the *reason* it's problematic is the uranium within it.
    * **Iodine:** Iodine is present, but it's secondary to the uranium's radioactive decay.

Therefore, the decay of **uranium** is the fundamental cause of the contamination and the question asks what element is responsible for the oxidation and harm.
"
Na mae malandi nini ezali te moko ya batoli oyo bapesaki bafandi ya esika kolanda aksida na uzine?,"The correct answer is **D: Kotika komela mai ya robine (Not turning off the tap water)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the workers instructed the residents to *not* turn off the tap water. This is because the radioactive materials (cesium and iodine) could contaminate the water supply if the tap was left running. The other options are actions taken *by* the residents to mitigate the situation, not the reason for the initial instruction.

Therefore, the question is asking what action the residents were *not* instructed to take, and the text explicitly says they were told *not* to turn off the tap.
"
Kolanda maloba ya Dr. eloko ya motuya pona Moll XDR-TB ezali?,"The correct answer is **B: Virisi ezali kotia tembe na bakisi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Monganga Moll akanisi ete mbala mosusu, bato mosusu ya maladi bazwaki virisi wana na lopitalo, mpe mibale kati na bango bazalaki basali ya lopitalo.""  This translates to: ""Doctor Moll stated that often, many people with the disease get this virus in the hospital, and the germs between them are spreading in the hospital.""

This clearly indicates the virus is spreading *within hospitals* - via contact with surfaces and equipment. Option B accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Virisi oyo ezali kozuama na lopitalo** (The virus is spreading in the hospital): While true, it's not *the reason* Dr. Moll highlights as the dangerous aspect. The dangerous aspect is *how* it's spreading.
*   **C: Talo ya bato oyo bakoki kozua virisi kouta na moto moko oyo azali na yango** (The danger is the number of people who can get the virus from one person): While the text mentions someone can infect 10-15 people, Dr. Moll's main point is about hospital transmission.
*   **D: Ezali na talo ya liwa likolo** (It's a danger of airborne particles): The text doesn't mention airborne transmission. It focuses on contact transmission within a hospital setting.



"
Babeli boni kati ya bae bazuaki virisi bamonani kozala basali na lopitalo?,"The correct answer is **C: 15**.

The text states: ""nsima ya mbula moko, moto oyo aza na maladi akoki kopesa maladi na bato 10 to 15 oyo bazalaki pembeni na ye."" (In particular, a person with the disease can infect 10 to 15 people who are nearby.)
"
Lolenge nini ya Teknolozie NextGen ezali kosalela?,"The correct answer is **A: Satellite-based technology**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Esalelaka mayele ya satelite na bokeseni na mayele ya kala oyo esimbamaki na radare..."" which translates to ""It uses satellite data in conjunction with old radar data..."". Therefore, satellite-based technology is a key component of NextGen.
"
Lolenge nini NextGen ezali kosalisa ba Pilotes?,"The correct answer is **B: Kopesa mpepo bansango ya solosolo (Providing pilots with real-time information)**.

The passage states that NextGen uses satellite imagery and radar to track aircraft and provide pilots with information, which helps them. Option B directly reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kopumbwa na banzela ya mukuse (Operating on more efficient routes):** While NextGen *does* aim for more efficient routes, the passage doesn't highlight this as the primary way it assists pilots.
* **C: Kokitisa bobebisi ya mapata na milinga (Improving the accuracy of maps and charts):** The passage mentions satellite imagery and radar, but not specifically about improving map accuracy.
* **D: Essence mukie (Cheaper fuel):**  The passage states that NextGen aims to reduce fuel consumption, but doesn't directly say it makes fuel cheaper. The focus is on reducing the *amount* of fuel used.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bato ya Istware baseki FBI te pona kotiya bokebi mingi na makambo nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kotambwisa bolongi ya lisanga na bango (To gain the trust of them)**.

The text states that the FBI has been engaging in these activities for many years, often with the intention of gaining the trust of the individuals they are investigating. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text. The text doesn't mention the FBI stealing money, gaining extensive knowledge of the issues, or specifically focusing on pornography.
"
Makambo ya bosoto na mobu ya mosala ezali kotinda FBI kosala nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Kotiya basali na makmbo ya pornografi**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the classified documents of the 2005 law mandate the FBI to do. The text explicitly states that the law allows the FBI to engage in ""pornography"" as part of its investigations. Option D directly reflects this.
"
Nini esalemaki na mutuka ya koboma moto oyo eyaki kosunga na aksida ya JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **A: Aksida (Oxidation)**.

The text states that the JAS 39C Gripen crashed and that ""bampepo ya mombongo ekwea te na aéroport wana"" (there was no smoke at the airport).  The description of the accident suggests a fire, and in aviation, a fire after a crash is often caused by fuel or other materials reacting with oxygen, leading to oxidation and combustion.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Ekweyaki (It leaked):** While leaking could be a factor *leading* to the fire, it doesn't explain *what* happened to the leaked substance.
*   **C: Epasukaki (It exploded):** The text doesn't mention an explosion.
*   **D: Essence esilaki (The fuel was):**  While fuel *could* be involved, the term ""oksida"" (oxidation) is a more general and accurate term for the chemical process that leads to a fire in this context.  The fuel would oxidize in the presence of oxygen.



"
"Kolanda aksida ya JAS 39C Gripen, Aeropor ekangamaki kopekisa nini?","The correct answer is **A: Mibembo ya mombongo (Fuel leaks)**.

The passage states: ""Bayebaki mokumbi na nsima, ezalaki mokambi ya escadron Dilokrit Pattavee. Bapanzi-sango ya mboka balobi ete motuka moko ya aeroport oyo ebomaki moko ebalukaki ntango ezalaki kosalisa. **Mibembo ya mombongo ekwea te na aéroport wana.**"" (They were busy in the morning, it was the work of the Dilokrit Pattavee squadron. Local sources said that one of the airport's runway was being repaired. **Fuel leaks were detected at the airport.**)

Therefore, the fuel leaks are the reason for the accident.
"
Na tango ya Botomboki ya Iran Brzezinski andimaki kopesa batoli na nani?,"The correct answer is **A: Kissinger**.

The passage states: ""Po aza NSA, asalisaki Carter na kolandela makambo ya politiki ya mokili, na ndakisa boyokani ya Camp David, na 1978; kobongisa boyokani kati na Amerika pe Chine na suka ya mibu 1970; **kotomboka ya bato ya Iran, na 1979**; pe ndenge Union Sovietique ekotaki na Afghanistan na 1979.""  It also says: ""Po aza NSA, asalisaki Carter na kolandela makambo ya politiki ya mokili, na ndakisa boyokani ya Camp David, na 1978; kobongisa boyokani kati na Amerika pe Chine na suka ya mibu 1970; kotomboka ya bato ya Iran, **na 1979**, pe ndenge Union Sovietique ekotaki na Afghanistan na 1979.""  Earlier in the passage, it mentions: ""pe nsima asalaki na boyangeli ya Lyndon B. Johnson. Po aza NSA, asalisaki Carter na kolandela makambo ya politiki ya mokili, na ndakisa boyokani ya Camp David, na 1978; kobongisa boyokani kati na Amerika pe Chine na suka ya mibu 1970; kotomboka ya bato ya Iran, na 1979; pe ndenge Union Sovietique ekotaki na Afghanistan na 1979.""  The passage specifically states that during the Iran hostage crisis (1979), Brzezinski advised Carter, but previously, it mentions Brzezinski advised **Kissinger** when he was NSA. 

Therefore, the answer is Kissinger.
"
Nani azalaki kosala mosala lokola mopesi-toli mpona libateli ya mokili mobimba (NSA) tii na mbula 1977?,"The correct answer is **A: Brzezinski**.

The passage explicitly states: ""apesaki toli na makambo etali boyokani na mikili ya bapaya, na nsima batiaki ye mopesi-toli mpona libateli ya mokili mobimba (NSA) banda 1977 kino 1981..."" which translates to ""he became advisor to the National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981...""
"
Na mae malandi nini emonisi te mpenza mosala ya Bobek na Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Tango azalaki kobeta na ekipe Atiaki mingete koleka 468**

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* Bobek's performance wasn't considered exceptional.**  The passage explicitly states that many players scored more goals and played more matches than Bobek for Partizan. 
* **Option A directly reflects this.** It points to the large number of matches Bobek played (468) as the reason he wasn't statistically exceptional compared to other players.
* **Options B, C, and D are incorrect:**
    * **B:** The passage doesn't say he scored more goals than any other player.
    * **C:** While he was a key player (the question asks about *why not exceptional*, not if he was important), this doesn't explain why his statistics weren't outstanding.
    * **D:** The passage says he didn't score *more* goals, so this is the opposite of the truth.



"
Maloba nini na mae matali istware ya Bobek na Partizan ezali ya solo?,"The correct answer is **C: Abetaki pona Partian tii na mbula 1995**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *why* Bobek left Partizan.
* The text states: ""Na 1995, baponaki ye mosani ya ndembo aleki nyonso na lisolo ya Partizan."" which translates to ""In 1995, they released him as a player from Partizan.""
* This directly indicates he left the team in 1995.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * A: He started playing for Partizan in 1945, not left.
    * B: He left for Zagreb, but the question asks *why* he left Partizan, not *where* he went.
    * D: While he might have been involved in scouting, the text doesn't say that *that's why* he left. It directly states he was released.



"
"Koland maloba wana, ezaleli nini ekesenisi Hesperonychus na Velociraptor","The correct answer is **B: Azali na linzaka ya mibale munene (It has larger wishbones)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Linzaka na ye ya mibale eza monene koleka, yango ebimisaki nkombo ya Hesperonychus oyo elimboli """"linzaka ya weste"""".""  This translates to ""Its wishbone is larger, and it is the namesake of Hesperonychus which is called 'western wishbone'.""

While the other options are mentioned in the passage as characteristics of Hesperonychus, the key differentiating factor highlighted is the size of its wishbone.  The text emphasizes this as the reason for the name ""western wishbone.""
"
Ntina ya kombo “Hesperonychus” ebimi na ezaleli nini ya bikelamu ya physique ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba manzaka (Arms)**.

The passage states: ""Linzaka na ye ya mibale eza monene koleka, yango ebimisaki nkombo ya Hesperonychus oyo elimboli """"linzaka ya weste."""" (Its arm bones are longer, which is why Hesperonychus, known as the ""west arm"" is named).
"
Na maloba malandi liloba nini na mae matli kobomana na masasi ezali yasolo?,"The correct answer is **A: Mobali na mwasi bango nyonso mibale bautaki na Texas** (All the relatives and friends of the man have gathered in Texas).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Bato ya likama bazalaki mitano"" (The relatives are five), but this is irrelevant to the core question of *why* the man's siblings are so far away.
* The passage mentions they *considered* celebrating in Buffalo, but ultimately the family gathered in Texas.
* The passage explicitly says the man was born in Buffalo, but his siblings are not there.
* The main point is that everyone has gone to Texas, highlighting the distance and separation.

Therefore, option A is the only one that directly addresses the reason for the distance between the siblings."
Maloba nini ezali yasolo pona mae matali likama esika oyo kobomana na masasi esalemaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Esalemaki na molulu ya Aniversaire** (It's happening in the anniversary's timeline/schedule).

Here's why:

The question asks *why* the anniversary is happening in the timeline. The passage states that the anniversary celebration was postponed and a new date will be set. Therefore, the celebration is happening *within* the anniversary's schedule or timeline, not on a specific location or type of party.



* **A: Esalemaki na feti ya Aniversaire na Buffalo** (It's happening at the anniversary party in Buffalo) - While the celebration *will* be in Buffalo, this doesn't explain *why* it's happening now.
* **C: Esalemaki na feti na Texas** (It's happening at the party in Texas) - The passage says the party was moved from Texas, so this is incorrect.
* **D: Esalemaki na feti na bango ya libala** (It's happening at a party with them) - This is too vague and doesn't address the reason for the timeline.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, mikonzi bazalaki na motungisi nini pona mae matali Luno?","The correct answer is **B: Mipepe mpe mbonge makasi (Wind and heavy rain)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Luno is experiencing a problem because ""mipepe makasi epusaki yango na kokwea na mai"" which translates to ""heavy winds and rain are hitting it and causing it to get wet.""  This is the direct cause of the problem and what the engineers are likely trying to address.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kozanga masuwa ya biloko (Emptying the fuel tank):** While potentially a course of action *eventually*, the immediate problem isn't an overfull fuel tank.
* **C: Koyiba essence (Adding fuel):**  The problem is *not* a lack of fuel; it's being damaged by weather.
* **D: Makoki ya baekipage kozoka (The ability of the crew to escape):** This isn't the problem being addressed. It's a potential *consequence* of the problem, but not the cause.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae matali Luno liloba nini ezali yasolo te?","The correct answer is **A: Pane ezuamaki liboso yakozua masuwa** (Because the fuel tank is constantly being filled).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Luno azalaki na 120–160 metele cubes ya carburant na kati na yango ntango ezwaki panne pe mipepe makasi epusaki yango na kokwea na mai."" This translates to ""Luno has 120-160 meters cubes of carburant in it when it breaks down or very strong winds cause it to leak into the water.""  The key is the phrase ""na kati na yango ntango ezwaki panne pe mipepe makasi epusaki yango na kokwea na mai"" which means the fuel is *constantly* being lost due to the breakdown and the wind causing leakage.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Masuwa ezalaki na 100 litres ya essence na kati na tango ya panne** (The tank has 100 liters of gasoline in it when it breaks down): The passage says ""meters cubes,"" which is a much larger quantity than 100 liters.
* **C: Kati ya baekipage zomi na mibale, moko azokaki** (Among the many cabins, only one is occupied): The passage says ""bakonzi bazalaki kobanga ete masuwa ekokweyisa biloko ememi,"" indicating the crew is *on* the Luno, not just in a single cabin.
* **D: Masuwa etindikamaki kokweya na mai** (The tank is leaking into the water): The passage says the fuel *leaks into* the water, not that the tank itself is leaking.

Therefore, the constant fuel loss due to the breakdown and wind leakage is the reason Luno is not functioning.



"
Na mibu nini Algerie ezuaki Lipanda?,"The correct answer is **C: Na mibu 1960**.

The text states: ""Na mibu 1960 azongaka na Algerie oyo eutaka kozwa lipanda mpona koteya lolenge ya kokamba filme."" which translates to ""In the 1960s, he went to Algeria which wanted to make a film to tell the story.""
"
Na esika nini BaTelevision etiyamaki te na ngonga ya matanga?,"The correct answer is **D: Na esika ya Saint-Pierre**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ba ecran ya batelevizio ebele ya minene ya batiaki yango na bisika ndenge na ndenge na Roma mpona kosalisa bato na kotala molulu wana."" which translates to ""Many large television screens were placed in various places in Rome to allow people to watch this event.""  It also mentions that these screens were not enough for everyone to watch in St. Peter's Square. Therefore, the televisions were placed *at* Saint-Pierre, but not *all over* Rome.
"
Molulu ya Matanga esalemaki wapi?,"The correct answer is **D: Yambo na Roma, sima na engumba mosusu ya Italy**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Bato mingi mpenza bazalaki wana ezalaki mingi mpenza yango wana likoki ezalaki te mpo bato nyonso bakota na matanga na esika ya Saint-Pierre. Ba ecran ya batelevizio ebele ya minene ya minene, batiaki yango na bisika ndenge na ndenge na Roma mpona kosalisa bato na kotala molulu wana. Na bingumba mingi mosusu ya Italie mpe na mikili mosusu, mingimingi na Pologne, basalaki bibongiseli ya ndenge moko, oyo bato mingi mpenza bamonaki yango.""

This translates to: ""Many people are like that, so it is not possible for everyone to go to the vigil at Saint-Pierre. Many large television screens are placed in various places in Rome to allow people to watch the vigil. In many parts of Italy and further afield, especially in Poland, there are broadcasts of the event, which are watched by many people.""

Therefore, the vigil took place in Rome and also in many parts of Italy and Poland.  Option D accurately reflects this.
"
"Kolanda kopanzana, banani bazuaki bakisi pona kozoka ya makasi?","The correct answer is **A: Pene ya bato mitano**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Moto moko te azokaki, kasi bato pene ya mitano bazalaki na ntango ya likama wana bapesaki bango kisi mpo bamiyokaki mabe mpenza.""  This translates to: ""One person didn't appear, but the five people who were in the same room gave them a lock to harm them greatly.""

Therefore, the five people who were in the room are the ones who continued to cause harm.
"
Nani apesaki nsango ya essence kotanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokonzi moko ya komapani ya essence**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mokonzi moko ya kompani ya essence ayaki na esika wana ntango moto moko ya pene abengaki mpona koyebisa ete essence ezosopana."" This translates to ""A worker from the essence company came to that place when someone nearby asked to investigate why the essence was leaking.""

Therefore, the worker from the essence company is the one who initially discovered and likely caused the essence leak.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bato boni bakufaki na likama?","The correct answer is **C: 5**

The passage states: ""Bato bakufaki eza, Nicholas Alden, mibu 25, mpe Zachary Cuddeback, mbiu 21. Cuddeback nde azalaki mokumbi. Edgar Veguilla azokaki na loboko pe na mbanga kasi Kristoffer Schneider basalaki ye lipaso mpona kobongisa elongi na ye. Mandako ya Uka elongaki te ntango ezalakisa kotala moto ya moto ya mitano.""

This translates to: ""The suspects are Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old. Cuddeback is the primary suspect. Edgar Veguilla is involved in the crime and, however, Kristoffer Schneider gave him a clue to reconcile with him. The victim's life did not end until the fifth suspect was identified.""

Therefore, the fifth suspect is the victim and the suspects mentioned are Nicholas Alden, Zachary Cuddeback, Edgar Veguilla and Kristoffer Schneider, for a total of **5**.
"
Monduki ya nani eboyaki kosala na ngonga moko tango ya laksida?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

Here's why: The text states: ""Mandako ya Uka elongaki te ntango ezalakisa kotala moto ya moto ya mitano."" This translates to ""Uka's reaction didn't allow seeing a person of five people"" implying Uka was the one who reacted first.

The question asks who was the first to react to the accident.

The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **Cuddeback:**  While Cuddeback is described as being the most skilled, the text doesn't state he reacted first.
*   **Schneider:** Schneider was not at the scene and was communicating via video link.
*   **Alden:** Alden is just mentioned as someone present.



"
Masano nini na kati ya mae malandi etiyamaki libanda ya Pmasano ya Olympic?,"The correct answer is **D: Karate**.

The text states that Squash, Karate, and other ball sports like baseball and softball are *not* currently part of the Olympic Games. It also mentions Rugby and Golf *are* part of the Olympics. Therefore, Karate is one of the sports listed as not being part of the current Olympic program.
"
Masano nini kati ya mae malandi oyo komite Olympic esalaki maponami pona kobakisa yango kati ya masano?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

The text explicitly states: ""Baponaki bugby, mingimingi lisanga ya Rugby..."" which translates to ""They included rugby, mainly Rugby union...""

The other options are mentioned as sports that were *not* included or previously included but are no longer part of the Olympic program.
"
Arthur Guinnes asalaki contrat na St James Gate Brewery pona mibu boni?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The question asks about the length of the contract. The text states: ""Arthur Guinness asalaki contrat ya mibu 9 000..."" which translates to ""Arthur Guinness signed a contract of 9,000 [years]"".

Therefore, the answer is 9000.
"
Pene ya ba Dollar billion boni Oyo Guinnes ekotisaka mbula na mbula?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The question asks how many *billion* dollars Guinness is estimated to have made. The text states that Guinness's business is worth 10 billion euros, which is equivalent to 14.7 billion dollars. Therefore, the closest option is 14.
"
Na bamboka boni Union Eropeyene esi ekuti virisi H5N1?,"The correct answer is **C: Sambo**.

The text states: ""France eza ekolo ya nsambo na Union Européenne oyo virisi ekoteli bango makasi..."" which translates to ""France is located in the heart of the European Union where the virus is particularly prevalent..."" and further specifies ""marshland near Lyon in eastern France."" Therefore, the virus is found in **marshland**.
"
Virisi H5N1 ezuamaki pona mbala ya suka na esika nini?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The text states: ""bamoni ete ezwaki libata moko ya zamba oyo akufaki na mokolo ya yambo, marshland pene ya Lyon na este ya **France**."" (The first outbreak of this avian flu occurred on a recent date, in the marshland near Lyon in eastern **France**.)
"
Mboka Haiti ekutanaki mbala ya suka na maladi tango nini yambo epanzana na basoda?,"The correct answer is **B: Tango mukie liboso ya basoda kokoma**.

The text states: ""Liboso ya kokoma ya basoda, Haiti ezalaki naino na mikakatano ya maladi wana banda na mibu 1800."" (After the soldiers left, Haiti was still suffering from the disease, with around 1800 cases.) This directly links the outbreak of the disease to the withdrawal of the UN peacekeepers.
"
Bosoto ya esika nini epanzaki bokono?,"The correct answer is **A: Ebale ya Artibonite**.

The text states: ""Liboso ya kokoma ya basoda, Haiti ezalaki naino na mikakatano ya maladi wana banda na mibu 1800. Institut ya Haiti mpona boyengebene mpe lipanda elobelaki boyekoli ya lipanda oyo emonisi ete bituluku ya basoda ya kimia ya ONU bauta Nepal bamemaki maladi wana na Haiti kozanga koyeba. Danielle Lantagne, nganga-mayele ya ONU na makambo ya maladi, alobaki ete mbala mosusu maladi mabe eutaki na basoda oyo batiaka kimia.""

The crucial part is: ""...yang'o esalaki ete mikrobe ekota na ebale Artibonite, ebale moko monene na Haïti."" This directly links the spread of the disease to the Artibonite River.



Therefore, the answer is A."
Boyangeli Ya Irlande ezali kolengela pona kosala nini ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kopesa etumbu na babuki mibeko pona bilangwiseli** (To give encouragement to people to speak out for freedom of expression).

Here's why:

* The text states the Irish government is trying to ""remedy the situation"" and encourage people to speak up against the government's actions. 
* The Minister of Culture and Arts is specifically calling on people to ""speak out"" and challenge the government's restrictions on freedom of expression.
* The phrase ""kopesa etumbu"" (to give encouragement) aligns with the idea of motivating people to exercise their right to freedom of expression.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kobakisa mibeko ya makasi pona kopekisa milangwiseli** (To strengthen the strict rules in order to promote freedom of expression): This is the opposite of what the text describes. The government is being criticized for *tightening* restrictions.
* **C: Kolembisa mibeko pona milangwiseli** (To revise the rules for freedom of expression): While revision might eventually happen, the immediate focus is on encouraging people to speak *now*.
* **D: Kosala milangwiseli ezala lisusu mbeba te** (Freedom of expression is no longer a problem): This contradicts the entire premise of the text, which details a problem with freedom of expression.



"
Mibeko epesaki ndingisa pona ngonga mukie na mboka Irlande pona kosala nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Milangwiseli (Propaganda)**.

The text states that the Irish government is being accused of using ""makambo ya bilangwiseli"" (propaganda) to manipulate the public and prevent them from understanding the true nature of the problems. The Minister of Justice has also been warned about the government's efforts to spread misinformation.
"
Moto ya mobulu bazali kolandela ye pona nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Kokota na ndako ya bato**.

The text states: ""Christopher Garcia, molobeli ya bapolisi ya Los Angeles, alobaki ete moto ya mobulu bazalaka kolandela ye po amikotisaki na ndako ya bato kasi te mpona mobulu makasi.""  This translates to: ""Christopher Garcia, a Los Angeles police officer, said that the person the mob is following is infiltrating people's homes, but not for the mob's benefit.""

Therefore, the mob is following him because he is breaking into people's houses.
"
"Na tango ya kobongola bilembo, moto ya mobulu azangaki kosala nini?","The correct answer is **D: Kosalela biloko ya moindo pona kobongola yango.**

The passage states: ""Elembo ebebaki mpenza te; mbongwana esalemaki na nzela ya biloko ya moindo oyo bitiaki na bilembo ya kimia pe motema mpona kongola the """"O"""" po batanga yango """"e"""".""  This translates to: ""The code wasn't easy to crack; the solution was done using chemical compounds that were placed in the code and a lot of effort to change the ""O"" to ""e"".""

This clearly indicates that Christopher Garcia used chemical compounds and effort (which is a form of applying ""moindo"" or ingenuity) to decode the message. Option D best captures this.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana,na bambeba oyo elandi molakisi ya Anglais Karno afundamaki te pona mbeba nini?","The best answer is **D: Kosalela maloba ya mabe na kelasi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mwana-kelasi moko ya kala alobaki ete 'asalelaka maloba mabe na kelasi, ateyaki basusu mayele ya kosala badate, mpe azalaki kaka 'moninga' ya bana-kelasi.'"" (A former student said he 'made bad remarks in class, frequently made fun of others, and was just a 'joke' of the students.')

* **The passage also mentions:**  Karno's tendency to speak a lot, and the perception that he makes students feel bad.  This aligns with the idea of ""kosalela maloba ya mabe na kelasi"" (making bad remarks in class).

Let's look at why the other options aren't as strong:

* **A: Kosalela misala ya bato misuu (Speaking about other people's mistakes):** While Karno might speak about others, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as a key factor in why he's not considered a great teacher.
* **B: Kolinga mwana ya kelasi (Ignoring a student):**  The passage suggests Karno *interacts* (perhaps negatively) with students, not that he ignores them.
* **C: Koniata bapiblisite kozanga kozwa ndingisa (Allowing publishers to try to make him appear great):** This is about external perception, not Karno's own actions in the classroom.



Therefore, the most direct and supported answer from the passage is **D**.



"
"Kolanada maloba wana, nani akangemaki Rolando Mendoza te?","The correct answer is **A: Bato ya kotala mboka (The kidnappers)**.

The text states: ""Rolando Mendoza abetaki masasi ya mondoki M16 na bato bayaki kotala mboka."" (Rolando Mendoza provided weapons to the kidnappers.)  This implies the kidnappers are the ones who are accusing or holding Mendoza responsible. While the police are investigating, the text doesn't explicitly state they are accusing him. The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba Policiers (The Police):** The police are investigating, not accusing him based on the given text.
* **C: Bana (The Children):** The children were victims, not accusers.
* **D: Bakangi bafoto (The Photographers):** The photographers were victims and captured the event; they aren't accusing him.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bakangemi nini nsango epesamaki te na ngonga koloba ete batiki bango?","The correct answer is **C: Bato bakangaka babafoto**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bato bakangaka bafoto bazwaki esika ya mwasi moko ya mobange po azalaki na mposa ya wese."" This translates to ""The people who took photos were taken to a place where one woman was in a position of complete helplessness."" This directly indicates that the people taking photos are the ones who are being implicated in the events and are therefore being questioned about why they didn't report what they saw.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bato ya kotala mboka (The attackers):** While the attackers are responsible for the violence, the question asks who the authorities are questioning *about not reporting* what they saw.
*   **B: Mibange (The families):** The families are victims of the violence, not the ones being questioned about reporting.
*   **D: Bana (The children):** The children are also victims, not the ones being questioned.

Therefore, the passage specifically points to the photo-takers as the individuals being questioned about their failure to report the atrocities.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani azali kozua ba signatire pona kopesa lisungi mpo libale ya basi na basi mpe mibali na mibali ezua ndingisa ya mibeko na mboka Brezil?","The correct answer is **A: Batomboki**.

The text states: ""Batomboki bazolikia kozwa basiniatire milio 1,2 mpona kopesa yango na Congre ya mboka na sanza ya zomi na moko."" This translates to ""They (politicians) are expected to sign 1.2 million signatures to present it to the National Congress.""

Therefore, the politicians are the ones gathering the signatures to support the initiative for bus lanes and cycle paths.  The other options are incorrect:

* **Roberto Jefferson:** He currently holds the initiative, but isn't the one *gathering* the signatures.
* **Lingomba ya Katolika na Roma:** The Catholic Church in Rome had no influence on the issue.
* **Marta Suplicy:** She initially championed the idea, but the current signature drive is being conducted by politicians.
"
Batomboki bakopesa ba signatire na bango epai ya nani?,"The correct answer is **B: Roberto Jefferson**.

The text states: ""Mabala wana ya civil endimaki kaka na Rio Grande do Sul. Mobeko yango, nsima ya kobongisa yango, eza sikoyo na maboko ya Roberto Jefferson."" which translates to ""These civil signatures were only in Rio Grande do Sul. Her proposal, after her effort to promote it, is now in the hands of Roberto Jefferson.""
"
"Kolanda maloba ya Armand Versace, nini esalamaki mbala moko yambo bato babanda kobulungana pona mopepe?","The correct answer is **C: Mipepe ya makasi ezalaki** (The wind was strong).

The passage states: ""...mopepe ekomaki na 70km/h... na nsima mbula ebandaki, kasi ezalaki makasi mpenza yango wana ezalaki neti ezobeta yo mbata na tonga..."" This directly translates to ""...the wind was at 70km/h... and as the wind increased, it was so strong that it was difficult to walk...""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mabanga ebandaki kokweya** (The wind was blowing up) - While related to wind, it doesn't explain *why* people were struggling to walk.
* **B: Emoniseli ezalaki kosala na ngonga mitano ya retard** (It seems to be a five-minute retard joke) - This is irrelevant and nonsensical.
* **D: Ayebaki te sika moto moko ya libota naye azalaki** (He didn't know anyone who could help him) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
"
"Kolanad maloba ya Versace, Mipepe ya makasi mingi ebadaki na ngonga nini?","The correct answer is **A: Ngonga mukie sima ya emoniseli kobanda**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...na nsima mbula ebandaki, kasi ezalaki makasi mpenza yango wana ezalaki neti ezobeta yo mbata na tonga..."".  This means the wind's speed is directly related to how much sand is being blown around. The stronger the wind (resulting from more sand being blown), the more difficult it is to see, and the more dangerous it becomes.

Therefore, the wind is strong *because* of the sand being blown.  Option A accurately reflects this. The other options are incorrect because the wind isn't necessarily related to the speed of the sand itself, the mother's recipe, or the sand's color.
"
"Yambo ya Fred,mipepe ya makasi mingi boni emonana na Est ya 35°W?","The correct answer is **A: Moko te** (No).

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** ""Fred eza mopepe ya makasi oyo ebeta naino te na sud mpe na este ya Atlantique banda ebandeli ya bafoto..."" This means Fred is *not* flying south or east of the photographer's location.
* **The photographer is located:** West of Cape Verde.
* **Fred is flying northwesterly:** This means Fred is moving *away* from the east of 35°W.

Therefore, Fred's plane will not be visible east of 35°W.



"
"Na ngonga Fred emonanaki pene ya Ile ya Cape vert, ezalakaki kokende na ndambo nini?","The correct answer is **A: Weste**.

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** Fred is flying northwest.
* **The problem states:** Fred is west of the Cape Verde Islands.
* **Therefore:**  Since he's flying northwest and west of the islands, he must be heading further west.

Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation!"
Kati ya bamodele elandi nini ezali na vitesi makasi koleka misusu ya kala?,"The correct answer is **A: Modele 802.11n**.

The question states that 802.11n has a much faster speed than older models, often reaching speeds of 600Mbit/s.  The other options (802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a) are older standards with significantly slower speeds.
"
Esengeli nini po modele 802.11n ekokana na sima na modele 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Baradio mibale**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks how 802.11n connects to 802.11b.**  802.11n is designed to be backward compatible. This means it *can* connect to devices using older standards like 802.11b. The key to this compatibility is that both standards operate on the same radio frequencies (usually 2.4 GHz).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vitesi ya mbangu makasi (Faster speed):** While 802.11n is significantly faster, the connection isn't *because* of the speed. It can connect even if the speed is limited by the older standard.
* **B: Makoki ya modele 802.11b kosala na 5.0Ghz (Ability of 802.11b models to operate on 5.0 GHz):** 802.11b *cannot* operate on the 5 GHz band.  It's a 2.4 GHz standard.
* **C: Vitesi ebele koleka ya 600Mbit/s (Faster speed of 600Mbit/s):**  Again, speed isn't the direct reason for compatibility. The connection is made possible by the radio frequencies.



Therefore, radio frequencies are essential for 802.11n to connect to 802.11b.
"
Milulu boni esengelaki na moto oyo azua mbano ya Wolo na Olympic asengelaki kosana na masano ya Commonwealth?,"The correct answer is **B: Misato**.

Here's why: The question states the athlete participates in the 100m and 200m races *and* the 4x100m relay at the Commonwealth Games. That's a total of three events.
"
Pona nini moto oyo azuaki mbano ya wolo na Olympic azalaki komela kisi te pona pasi naye?,"The correct answer is **C: Azalaki kotungisama ete ekokaki kosala mabe na kolongono ya nzoto naye (He is afraid of harming his body due to his joints).**

Here's why:

The passage states the athlete is hesitant to train because he fears he might injure his joints. The other options don't align with the information provided.

*   **A: Azalaki na pasi te (He is not in trouble):**  This is incorrect. The passage explicitly says he *is* in trouble because of his hesitation.
*   **B: Ebelisaki ye (He is depressed):** While fear *can* lead to depression, the passage focuses on a physical concern (joint injury).
*   **D: Bapekisa yango Na masano ya Common wealth (To prepare him for the Commonwealth games):** The passage highlights his *inability* to train for the Commonwealth games *because* of his fear, not to prepare for them.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini epesaki kozanga kososola makambo na mae matali koningana ya mabele?","The correct answer is **A: Komonana ya mapata ya moindo (Observation of ash clouds)**.

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Mapata ya moindo oyo eza na boyokani te na volcan emonanaki na nse ya ngomba."" (Ash clouds observed in the sky are seen in the direction of the wind.) This directly links the observation of the ash clouds to the reason for the concern.
* While the other options are related to the situation, they aren't the *direct* reason for the concern.
    * The map shows the location of the ash cloud, but doesn't *cause* the concern.
    * The report from the Icelandic Meteorological Office provides information, but the observation of the ash clouds is the trigger for the monitoring.
    * The distance of the ash cloud from Iceland is relevant, but not the immediate cause of the monitoring.

Therefore, the observation of the ash clouds is the primary reason for the monitoring of the situation.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Mbongwana na fase esalemaki na tango nini?","The correct answer is **A: Liboso ya sanza ya misato mokolo ya 10**.

The text states: ""Koningana ya mabele ya makasi oyo ebongwani esalamaki na mokolo ya 10 sanza ya misato na nordi este ya songe ya volcan caldera."" This translates to: ""The most intense solar flare was observed on the 10th day of the month in the northeast of the volcano caldera.""
"
Na mae matali sonde ya sanza ya Chandryaan-1 nini ezali yasolo te ?,"The correct answer is **C: Bolongoli ya sonde ezalaki malamu** (The probe's orbit was shallow).

Here's why:

* The text states that Orbiteur ya sanza ezangi mokumba Chandrayaan-1 ebwaki sonde na bango na sanza (MIP), elekaki likolo ya sanza na bakilometele 1,5 km na segonde moko (3000 miles na ngonga), **mpe ekoki kokwea malamu pene ya ndambo ya sudi ya Sanza.** This translates to ""The orbiter... could fly close to the south pole of the Moon.""  This implies a relatively *shallow* orbit, meaning it didn't orbit at a great altitude.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Orbiteur oyo etindaki sonde ezalaki na baekipage** (The orbiter that launched the probe had a payload): While true in a general sense for space missions, this isn't the primary reason why Chandrayaan-1's orbiter was different. It's a bit of a red herring.
* **B: Sonde ezalaki na bisaleli ya litomba mingi** (The probe had a large surface area):  The text doesn't mention the probe's size or surface area.
* **D: Basonge ya sonde ezalaki na couleur** (The probe's instruments were colored): The text says the *entire* probe was colored to be visible, not that the instruments themselves were colored.

Therefore, the shallow orbit is the key difference highlighted in the text.
"
Na mae malandi maloba nini elimboli malamu Sonde ya Lunar?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekitaki pene ya ndambu na nordi ya Sanza (It is aiming for the south pole of the Moon)**.

Here's why:

* The provided text explicitly states: ""Orbiteur ya sanza sanza ezangi mokumba Chandrayaan-1 ebwaki sonde na bango na sanza (MIP), elekaki likolo ya sanza na bakilometele 1,5 km na segonde moko (3000 miles na ngonga), mpe ekoki kokwea malamu pene ya ndambo ya sudi ya Sanza."" (The lunar orbiter is not like Chandrayaan-1 which is a lander on the Moon (MIP), it orbits the Moon at a speed of 1.5 km/s (3000 miles per hour) and can approach the south pole of the Moon.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kokita ya aksida ezalaki malamu (Oxidation is significant):** The text doesn't mention oxidation.
* **C: Elongolamaki na manned Orbit (It is in a manned orbit):** The text says it's an *orbiter*, meaning it's unmanned.
* **D: Ezalaki komema bisaleli mibale ya motuya mingi (It is collecting large amounts of human waste):** This is irrelevant and not mentioned in the text.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, malengeli ya lolenge nini ekosalema ya suka pona kobatela na maladi?","The correct answer is **C: Mangwele ya Encephalitis**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Manaka ya mangwele oyo bakopesa na bisika oyo bato babeli mingi na mbula oyo ekozala na retard po mosolo eza te pe bazotia likebi naino na maladi misusu."" 

This translates to: ""The virus spread by mosquitoes in these areas causes children to have a delay in development and are also not able to go to school due to other diseases.""

While mosquito nets are mentioned as a preventative measure (to avoid mosquito bites), the *cause* of the developmental delay and other diseases is identified as the **Encephalitis virus spread by mosquitoes**.
"
Lolenge nini maladi ekomaka epai ya bato?,"The correct answer is **C: Bangulu**.

The text states: ""Bato ya liboso oyo babeli maladi wana na eleko oyo ezalaki na suka ya sanza ya nsambo. Maladi wana eutaka na bangulu..."" which translates to ""People who are old and sick with this illness are affected by a mosquito-borne disease. This disease is transmitted by mosquitoes...""

Therefore, the disease is transmitted by mosquitoes (bangulu).
"
Kozanga ya phrase ya liboso ekoki kopesa nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Boyokani ya civile pona libala ya basi na basi mpe mibali na mibali**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kozanga kolonga ya etumbu ya mibale, oyo ezosenga bapekisa libala ya mibali na mibali, ekoki kobimisa boyokani ya civile na mikolo ezali koya."" This translates to: ""The phrase of the law, which incites the division of people into men and women, can cause civil unrest.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Botali ya HJR-3 pona mbala mosusu:** The passage mentions HJR-3 but doesn't say it was never used again. It just notes it was used in 2015/2016 for a specific purpose.
* **C: Likita ya eleko ya mbalakata:** While the phrase relates to a specific law, the passage focuses on its *consequence* – civil unrest – not the law itself.
* **D: Kopekisa ya basi na basi mpe mibali na mibali:**  While the phrase *incites* division between men and women, the passage highlights the *result* of this incitement - civil unrest. It doesn't describe the act of dividing itself.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Babomaki phrase ya mibale na ngonga nini?","The correct answer is **A: Na ngonga ya makita ya eleko** (At the start of the session).

The text states: ""Mbongwana esalemaki na makita ya eleko oyo ntango mimonisi ya ministere babomaki phrase ya liboso..."" which translates to ""The debate took place at the start of the session where the minister's representatives noticed the phrase...""
"
Nani abimisaki “Panama pappers”?,"The correct answer is **A: Biro ya bavoka “The Mossack Fonseca firm”**.

The text states: ""Mikanda ya Panama eza maloba oyo basalelaka mpona mikanda pene ya milio zomi ya biro ya ba avoka ya Panama ya Mossack Fonseca..."" This directly indicates that the law firm, Mossack Fonseca, is the source of the Panama Papers.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Zulunalu** - The Guardian published the findings, but didn't create the papers.
*   **C: Deutsche Bank** - Deutsche Bank was implicated in the documents, but didn't release them.
*   **D: Mikonzi ya boyangeli ya Icelande** - These organizations investigated the documents, but didn't release them.
"
"Koalanda maloba wana, zulunalu ya Grande Britagne bapataki nani lokola moto oyo azali kokamba kompani oyo ebombaka misolo?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Bank**.

The text states that The Guardian reported Deutsche Bank was implicated in about 1/4 of the 1200 companies linked to the Panama Papers. The question asks who the British newspaper implicated in *creating* the company, and while the other options are involved in the scandal, Deutsche Bank is specifically linked as a major player in using these companies for financial activities.
"
Aksida ya Mpepo nini na mae malandi ebomaki bato ebele koleka?,"The correct answer is **C: mpepo esalaki aksidai na nzela kokende Iran kouta Armenie**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Sanza eleki Iran ekutanaki na likama koleka monene ya mopepe nsima ya mibu mingi ntango mpepo moko oyo ezalaki kokende na Armenie epanzanaki, ebomaki bato 168 oyo bazalaki na kati.""  (Without an Iran meeting a very large air corridor, when a single plane traveling to Armenia crashed, 168 people inside died.)
* This indicates that the crash on the route *to* Armenia resulted in a high death toll.
* Options A and D are incorrect because they don't encompass the scale of the disaster mentioned in the text. Option B is too specific, focusing only on the police helicopter incident, which caused a smaller number of deaths.
"
Na mae malandi nini ezali te kati ya bantina pona makama ebele ya bampepo na Iran ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kozanga mbongo pona kosomba bampepo ya sika (Lack of funding to develop air defense systems)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Etumbu ya mikili mingi elimboli ete bakoki te kosombampepo ya sika."" This translates to ""The age of the equipment indicates that they are unable to develop long-range air defense.""  This inability is directly linked to a lack of resources.
* The other options are not supported by the text:
    * **A: Bampepo ya basivile mpe ya basoda oyo esala kala (Civilian and outdated military aircraft):** While outdated aircraft contribute to the problem, the primary issue highlighted is the lack of ability to *develop* a system to counter modern threats.
    * **C: Mipekiselo oyo epekisi kosomba ba mpepo ya sika (Sanctions that prevent the development of air defense):** The passage doesn't mention sanctions.
    * **D: Lolenge mabe ya kobatela bampepo (Poor maintenance of aircraft):**  While poor maintenance could worsen the situation, the text focuses on the inability to *develop* an effective counter-air defense system, implying a deeper problem than just maintenance.



"
Na mae malandi nini ezalaki te na kati ya rapore ya etuluku oyo ezoyekola makambo ya Iraq?,"The correct answer is **B: Boyokani oyo ekoki komema mbongwana, Bitumba na Iraq ekoki kosalema lisusu te**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ekebisi ete moto moko te akoki kondimisa ete likambo moko oyo ekosalema na Irak sikoyo ekosukisa bitumba ya bana-mboka, mobulu oyo ezokoma kaka mingi, **to kokanga nzela po makambo ebeba mingi te.**""  This means the text *doesn't* say that the bombings are a potential path to peace, nor does it say that the bombings will definitely stop. It emphasizes the uncertainty and potential for things to worsen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kolobela mabe mibeko oyo ezali:** The text *does* condemn the actions, labeling them as ""kolobela mabe mingi"" (very badly condemning).
* **C: Toli ya kobatela bandelo ya Iraq:** The text discusses the *causes* of the Iraq problem and the potential for further instability, not specifically a ""solution"" for Iraq.
* **D: Libondeli pona koyokana na Amerike:** While the report mentions a need for international cooperation, it doesn't frame it as a direct ""obligation"" to cooperate with America. It's more about the necessity of a broader international effort.



"
Nini na mae malandi oyo Etuluku ya koyekola makambo ya Iraq elobelaki te ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kobongola lolenge ya kosala makambo na lombango**.

The text explicitly states: ""Rapore elobeli mabe mingi na makambo nyonso oyo eza na mobeko wana ya kosalela mpona Irak mpe ezolendisa kosala mbongwana ya lombango."" This translates to ""The report strongly criticizes all aspects of the approach to Iraq and advocates for a diplomatic solution.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekebisi pona kosilisa bitumba na Iraq epesama:** The text states the report *cannot* definitively say if the bombings are fueling the insurgency.
*   **C: Kosalela masolo ya polepole:** While the report advocates for a diplomatic solution, it doesn't specifically say it calls for a slow escalation.
*   **D: Kotiya miango ya sika ya politiki:** The report actually calls for *awakening* the political consciousness to resolve the Iraq issue.

"Kolanada maloba ya Police, nani azalaki moninga ya pemebeni makasi ya Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text states: ""Polisi elobi ete Lo Piccolo alongaki mpo azalaki moninga ya pembeni ya Provenzano na Provenzano pe boyebi na ye ya mingi esali ete bapatron ya kala bapesa ye lokumu ntango azosala politiki ya Provenzano ya kotikala ya kofanda na nse mpenza mpe kolendisa nzela ya courant."" This translates to ""The police say that Lo Piccolo was a close associate of Provenzano and knew him well, and that his patrons gave him a role when he started Provenzano's political activity of staying in the shadows and channeling money.""

The other options are incorrect. Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino were victims of the Mafia. Ansa is a news agency."
"Kolanda nsango epesami na maloba wana, nini etindaki Falcone na liwa?","The correct answer is **A: Babomaki ye na tango ya Etumba “the Riina-driven war”**.

Nini na mae malandi ezali te moko ya bolongi ya Hitoshi Saito ?,"The correct answer is **C: Molongi ya mitole mibale ya Wolo na Olympic**.

The text explicitly states: ""Moto ya Japon judoka Hitoshi Saito, oyo alongaki mitole mibale ya wolo na masano ya Olympique akufi na mibu 54."" This translates to: ""Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, who won gold medals at the Olympics, died at the age of 54.""

Therefore, his notable achievement and what he was known for was winning gold medals in the Olympics.
"
Esika nini Iwasaki akimaki kolapa ndai?,"The correct answer is **D: Tibet**.

The passage states: ""Bapirate bayibaki ye, bambwa mabe babundisaki ye na Tibet..."" which translates to ""Pirates, bad people attacked him in Tibet...""  This implies Iwasaki was attacked *in* Tibet.
"
Nani ambundisaki Iwasaki,"The correct answer is **B: Bapirates**.

The text states: ""Bapirate bayibaki ye, bambwa mabe babundisaki ye na Tibet..."" which translates to ""Pirates, bad people kidnapped him in Tibet...""

Therefore, the pirates kidnapped Iwasaki.
"
Alonso asilisaki course naye na ngonga nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Sima ya Schumacher kobebisa pneu naye ya liboso** (Schumacher's reason for taking him out was because of a flat tire).

The passage explicitly states: ""Michael Schumacher asalisaka kala mingi te na nsima ya Alonso, mpona makama mingi akutanaki na yango ntango azalaki kobunda na komema motuka na ye. **Sima ya Schumacher kobebisa pneu naye ya liboso**.""  (Michael Schumacher often overtook Alonso, especially when he was trying to overtake him while changing tires. **Schumacher took him out because of a flat tire**.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fisichella abungisaki makoki ya kokumba mutuka naye** (Fisichella showed his ability to overtake him): While Fisichella might have been a factor, the text focuses on Schumacher's action.
* **C: Sima ya Schumacher kosilisa course naye moko** (Schumacher took him out alone): The text implies Schumacher had multiple incidents.
* **D: Sima ya koleka liboso** (The reason to get out completely): This is too general and not supported by the text.
"
Nini etindaki Schumacher kosilisa course naye noki?,"The correct answer is **A: Abungisaki makoki ya kotambwisa mutuka naye (He was able to drive his car skillfully)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Michael Schumacher asalisaka kala mingi te na nsima ya Alonso, mpona makama mingi akutanaki na yango ntango azalaki kobunda na komema motuka na ye."" This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher was often very close to Alonso, especially when he was trying to overtake him while driving his car.""

This indicates that Schumacher's skill in driving and maneuvering the car was the key factor in his close racing with Alonso. The other options aren't supported by the text:

*   **B: Aksida na Alonso (Accident with Alonso)** - The text doesn't mention an accident.
*   **C: Pneu kobeba oyo esalemaki na Fisichella (Tire failure that happened to Fisichella)** - This refers to Fisichella, not Schumacher.
*   **D: Suspansion ya motuka kobeba (Car suspension failure)** - The text doesn't mention any mechanical failures.



"
"Kolanda maloba wana, ezali mosala ya nani kotia amande pona bakangemi?","The correct answer is **B: Zuzi Glynn**.

The text explicitly states: ""Na sanza ya minei ya mobu oyo, zuzi Glynn abimisaki ekateli moko ya kosukisa na ntango mokuse mpona kokanga lisanga po epesa te bonsomi na bato oyo bakangi bango banda koleka bangonga 24 banda bakangaki bango, bato oyo esambiselo eyoki bango naino te."" This translates to: ""In the meantime, Officer Glynn took it upon himself to seek a solution to establish a system to provide assistance to those who want to come to the Central Booking facility, those who are not their own relatives.""

Therefore, Glynn is the one initiating the effort to provide assistance and manage the process of recording information.
"
"Kolanda etinda ya bopekisi pona ngonga mukuse oyo elobelami na maloba wana, Bakangemi basengeli kozala na nini mpo bakanga bango koleka bangonga 24?","The correct answer is **A: Amande**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Moyokanisi atiaka amande, soki bandimi yango, andimisaka bifundeli oyo moto akangaki moto yango alobaka."" This translates to: ""The mediator requires a guarantee, if provided, they will release the person the person claims is holding them.""

Therefore, for the person to be released, they need to provide **amande (a guarantee/collateral)**.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, ntina nini esalelamaki te mpo na kolimbola kozongela mbala ya mibale oyo elongolamaki?","The correct answer is **B: Bokeseni ya mibeko (Lack of political will)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Badiplomate balobaki ete bamoni mikakatano mingi na mibeko ya Afghanistan yango wana ntina ya toure ya mibale eza te."" (Diplomats said they saw a lot of discord in Afghanistan's political system, that's why an election is not possible.) This directly points to a lack of political will and unity within the Afghan government.  The political system is fractured and unwilling to cooperate on elections.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Makama ya bokengi (Lack of funding):** While funding can be an issue, the primary reason stated is the political discord.
* **C: Kosalela mbongo koleka (Security concerns):**  Security is a factor in Afghanistan, but the passage focuses more on the political inability to hold elections.  It's linked to the internal discord.
* **D: Kozanga bososoli ya mibeko (Opposition to reforms):** Opposition to reforms *could* be a component, but the passage emphasizes a fundamental lack of political consensus and will to hold elections.



Therefore, **B: Bokeseni ya mibeko (Lack of political will)** best captures the core reason cited in the passage for why an election isn't happening.
"
"Mpo na nini nsukansuka, batindami bamonaki ete kozongela mbala ya mibale ezalaki na ntina te?","The correct answer is **A: Elandaki mibeko te (It's not in the constitution)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Badiplomate balobaki ete bamoni mikakatano mingi na mibeko ya Afghanistan yango wana ntina ya toure ya mibale eza te."" (Diplomats stated that they saw many contradictions in the Afghan constitution, which is why a presidential election is not in place.)

Therefore, the reason the diplomats believe holding elections is not necessary is because it's not in the Afghan constitution.
"
Nani apesaka lisalisi ya kosamba mpo na FATA?,"The correct answer is **A: Bokonzi ya Pakistan (Government of Pakistan)**.

The text states that the President of Pakistan assigned ""political men"" to oversee FATA. This implies the Pakistani government is responsible for the administration. The sentence also indicates that these ""political men"" were tasked with ""governing and establishing order"" in FATA, which is a function of the government.
"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **C: Bazali kolanda mibeko ya Pakistan** (They are deploying troops to Pakistan).

Here's why:

The text states that the British and Pakistani authorities deployed ""politicians"" (which likely means military or administrative personnel) to FATA (Federal Administrative Tribal Areas) to govern it and establish control.  The final sentence explicitly mentions they need to ""deploy troops"" to maintain order and enforce laws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazali kopesa misala ya bosembo** (They are carrying out diplomatic missions): While there might be a diplomatic component, the core of the statement is about deploying personnel for governance and control, not diplomatic discussions.
* **B: Bampo nampo namanaki na mokambi ya Pakistan** (They are staying in the borders of Pakistan): The text doesn't state they are staying *within* Pakistan; it mentions deploying to FATA, which is a specific region *within* Pakistan.  The statement focuses on *deployment*.
* **D: Bazali na bokonzi mobimba likoló na bisika mosusu** (They are in powerful positions in many places):  The text focuses on their *deployment* to a specific, previously ungoverned region (FATA), not about general power or positions elsewhere.



"
Emma Stone azuaki libonza nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Mosani malamu koleka oyo asungaka (An award-winning actress)**.

The text says ""Filme, oyo ezalaki kolakisa Ryan Gosling na Emma Stone, ezwi bambano na milongo nyonso ya minene..."" which translates to ""The movie starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone is different in every way..."" and goes on to describe the film's quality. The phrase ""Banzembo mibale ya fileme wana, Audition (Bazoba oyo Balota) pe Engumba ya Minzoto, ezwaki mbango ya banzembo ya kala ya kitoko"" translates to ""The award-winning films, Audition (Days That Flash) and The Artist, are the work of the finest filmmakers.""

Therefore, Emma Stone is described as an award-winning actress.
"
Libonza nini filme empo namaki te?,"The correct answer is **A: Foto kitoko koleka** (The pictures are very beautiful).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the visual aspects of the film:

* ""Cinématographie"" (Cinematography) is specifically mentioned.
* The passage mentions the beauty of the actors and the ""makelele"" (the overall visual spectacle/impact).
* The studio's financial success also suggests a visually appealing film that draws audiences.

While the other options might be elements of a good film, the passage *specifically* highlights the film's visual beauty as a major selling point.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi etikalaki kosala nsima ya koningana ya mabele?","The correct answer is **A: Ba reacteur nyonso na izine ya Hokuriku's Shika**.

Here's why:

The question asks where the nuclear accident occurred. The text states that Hokuriku Electric Power Co. had a leak in the outer layer of the Shika nuclear reactors. Therefore, the reactors themselves are where the accident originated. The other options are consequences or locations affected by the accident, but not the source.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ebebaki mpo na koningana ya mabele?","The correct answer is **B: Ba reacteur mibale na izine ya Shika**.

The text states: ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. alobelaki likama moko te ya koningana ya mabele pe ba reacteur nimero 1 na 2 izine monene ya nikleyere ya Shika ekangamaki."" This directly translates to ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. confirmed that the core of the reactors number 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear plant was not damaged."" Therefore, the damage is specifically related to the Shika nuclear reactors.
"
"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali na mokanda yango te?","The correct answer is **B: Ntina ya etumba ya 1967**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is *not* mentioned in the text. The text focuses on:

* **The conflict over land:** Specifically, the land Palestinians want (pre-1967 borders) and the 1967 borders.
* **Jerusalem:** The holy city and the issue of its future.
* **Israeli military presence:**  The deployment of Israeli troops on the Jordan River.
* **Palestinian Authority (PA) response:**  The PA's lack of response to the Israeli troop deployment.

Option B, ""Ntina ya etumba ya 1967"" (Not the 1967 borders), is directly contradicted by the text, which extensively discusses the 1967 borders as a key point of contention. The other options *are* mentioned in the text.



"
"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi ezali moko ya makambo oyo Palestine esengaka te?","The correct answer is **C: Biyano oyo etali mikolo ya koyia ya Jerusalem (The status of the holy sites of Jerusalem)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what Palestine *doesn't* concede. 
* The passage states Palestine is seeking a return to the 1967 borders, including the status of Jerusalem as a holy site for all religions. 
* The other options are things Palestine is *conceding* or negotiating on:
    * **A: Bandelo oyo esalemi na kotalela makambo oyo ezalaki liboso ya etumba (The status of the settlements in the occupied territories):**  Palestine is negotiating on settlements.
    * **B: Kozala ya basoda oyo ezali kokoba na lobwaku ya Jordan (The presence of Israeli troops on the Jordan River):**  Palestine is seeking to limit or remove Israeli troops.
    * **D: Kozala ya basoda mpo na mbula mitano na lobwaku ya Jordan (The presence of troops for five more miles on the Jordan River):** This is a specific aspect of the troop presence that Palestine is negotiating on, and thus conceding to some extent.

Therefore, the status of the holy sites of Jerusalem is the one thing Palestine is least likely to concede on.



"
Ma ayekolaki mibeko na ekolo nini?,"The correct answer is **A: United States of America**.

The text states that Ma obtained a ""green card"" which is a US immigration document. It also mentions attending the University of New York and Harvard, both in the US.
"
"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, kotelema makasi mpo na ekolo nini esalisaki Ma alonga na mampo nampo nami?","The answer is **A: United States of America**.

The text explicitly states that Ma has a ""green card"" which grants the right to live and work in the United States. The entire paragraph is about Ma's qualifications and her ability to leverage them to potentially influence China, suggesting her focus is on the US context.
"
"Ndenge elobami na mokapo yango, Carolyn Wilson asalaki mpo na nani liboso alongwa na engumba?","The correct answer is **C: Oha**.

The text states: ""ntango bato bazofutela babandaki kolobela makambo ekomelaki bango, na mbala mingi na kati ya mabota wana bayebaki ete **Carolyn Wilson ya OHA** ayibaki mbongo oyo babombaki pe akimaki mboka."" 

This directly indicates that Carolyn Wilson of OHA is the person who is frequently contacted.
"
"Lokola etikali masano minei na eleko, nani azali na esika ya minei ya lisano ya batambwisi mutuka?","The correct answer is **A: Hamlin**.

Here's why:

The question asks who is in the *lowest* (minei) position. We need to find the driver with the fewest points.

*   **Keselowski:** 2250 points
*   **Johnson:** 2243 points
*   **Hamlin:**  Hamlin is ""point ya retard tuku mibale"" and 5 points behind Bowyer. Bowyer has 2248 points, so Hamlin has 2243 points - 5 = 2238 points.
*   **Kahne:** 2220 points
*   **Truex, Jr.:** 2207 points
*   **Stewart, Gordon, Kenseth, Harvick:** All tied at 2207 points.

Comparing all the point totals, **Hamlin (2238 points)** is the lowest.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Hamlin**."
"Kolanda momekano ya mbangu oyo tolobeli na eteni, Kahne azali na bapwe boni na lisano ya batambwisi mutuka?","The correct answer is **D: 2207**.

The question asks for Kahne's points. The text states: ""Kahne na Truex, Jr. baza na esika ya mitano pe ya motoba, baza na ba point 2 220 pe 2 207.""  This means Kahne has 2220 points and Truex Jr. has 2207 points.

The question asks for Kahne's points, and the text explicitly states Kahne's points are 2220. Therefore, D is the answer.



"
"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, mbala boni bato bamonaki mabanga oyo kokweya mpe na nsima emonanaki ete eutá na Mars?","The correct answer is **B: Mbala mitano**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bakanisaka ete eza mbala ya mitano na lisolo ya bato bato bamona eloko oyo eutaka na mars eyei kokwea awa na Mabele.""  This translates to ""It is said that it is five times more often that people see something that falls from Mars in Mabele.""
"
"Ndenge tolobeli yango na bokomi, nini ezali solo mpo na mabanga oyo bamonaki ete eutá na mars?","The correct answer is **A: Bango nyonso bazwamaki na ntango ya mbula ya mabanga ya sanza ya nsambo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mabanga zomi na mitano na kati na yango euta na mbula ya sanza ya nsambo eleki."" (Many of the five times within them are due to the magnetic field.)  This directly answers the question of what the reason is for the meteorites appearing to have come from Mars.  The other options are details *about* the meteorites, not the *reason* for their appearance to have Martian origins.
"
Schumacher azwaki pansiɔ ntango nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Nsima na elonga na ye ya nsambo na lisano**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *when* Schumacher fell behind.
* The passage states Schumacher was behind Felipe Massa in 2006 and again after his retirement in 2006. 
* While he was also behind Massa after the accident in 2009, the passage explicitly mentions his *retirement* as the time he fell behind. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nsima ya kokweya ya Felipe Massa** - This is a consequence of the situation, not the time he fell behind.
* **C: Nsima ya kozua esika ya Felipe Massa** -  This is a description of *his* position, not when he *reached* that position.
* **D: Na nsuka ya eleko 2009 nyonso** -  He didn't fall behind *during* the entire 2009 season, but rather *after* the accident which impacted his career. The passage highlights the effect of his retirement.



"
Massa azokaki ntango nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Na ntango ya Grand Prix moko** (At one Grand Prix).

The text states: ""Moto ya Bresil azokaki makasi na motu nsima ya kosala aksida na lisano ebengami Grand Prix ya Hongrie ya 2009."" which translates to ""The Brazilian driver was very close to the driver before crashing at the Hungarian Grand Prix of 2009.""  This clearly indicates Massa's close call happened at a single Grand Prix.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nsima ya kolonga lisano Formula 1** (At the beginning of the Formula 1 season): The text doesn't mention this.
* **C: Liboso ya kozwa pansiɔ ya Schumacher** (At the end of Schumacher's career): While Schumacher was a competitor, the text focuses on Massa's near-accident, not the end of Schumacher's career.
* **D: Liboso ya eleko 2009** (At the end of 2009): The text specifies the near-accident happened during the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009, not at the *end* of the year.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ebongiseli yango ekozala na bopusi likoló na AOL?","The best answer is **C: Motango ya basaleli ya AOL ekobunda na basaleli ya Yahoo mpe Microsoft.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* the AOL IM service is failing.** The prompt states that users are experiencing problems and that the service isn't working as expected.
* **Option C directly addresses a likely cause.** The prompt mentions that people are switching to Yahoo! and Microsoft. This suggests that those companies offer a better, more reliable Instant Messaging service. If AOL's technology is outdated compared to its competitors, it would explain why users are abandoning it.
* **The other options are less likely:**
    * **A:** While increased workload *could* be a factor, the problem is framed as a general failure, not just overload.
    * **B:**  It's unlikely that AOL only supports a single type of IM.
    * **D:** While AOL's presence in the US *might* be shrinking, the prompt focuses on the *technical* issue of the IM service failing.

Therefore, **C** is the most logical and directly supported answer based on the provided text.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kosila nsima ya ebongiseli ya sika?","The correct answer is **A: Bokoli ya internet oyo epalangani mingi na Etats-Unis (The internet infrastructure in the United States)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL's IM service was having trouble due to being heavily reliant on the internet infrastructure in the US. The other options are related to *consequences* or potential causes, but the underlying reason for the problem is the infrastructure itself.

* **B: Kosalela zando ya IM (Using IM)** is the action being affected, not the root cause.
* **C: Bonsomi ya AOL ya kokolisa zando na lombango na yango moko (AOL users using it exclusively)** might contribute to the problem by overloading the system, but the fundamental issue is the infrastructure.
* **D: Boyokani ya Yahoo na Microsoft (The partnership between Yahoo and Microsoft)** is mentioned as a potential reason for AOL's decline, but not the direct cause of the IM service issues described.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer is **A**."
Bato boni oyo bakufaki na kobundisa wana bazalaki ba polisi te?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The question asks how many people who were injured in the attack were *not* police officers. The text states that 19 civilians were injured, while the governor stated that some of the attackers were disguised as police. The question specifically asks about the *injured* people who were not police. Therefore, the answer is 19.
"
Nani ayebisaki motu oyo balobi ete azali na likambo yango?,"The correct answer is **A: Polisi (Police)**.

The text states: ""Polisi elobi ete bazokanisa ete Daesh (ISIL) nde moto abimisaki bitumba wana."" which translates to ""The police say they will investigate that Daesh (ISIL) is the one who planted the bomb."" This indicates the police are the ones making the claim about who planted the bomb.
"
"Na ntina ya ndenge ya Florida lokola ekolo molongi-azuaka nionso, nini epesamaki na Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Batindami ya ekolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Floride apesi mimonisi na ye tuku mitano nyonso na Romney, esali ete azala na liboso lokola moto oyo akolonga na maponi ya parti ya ba républicain."" This translates to: ""Florida gave him all five electoral votes, making him the only person to be completely supported by the Republican party's electoral votes."" 

This means Romney received all of Florida's electoral votes, and Florida is a state that votes based on its electoral votes. The question is asking what Florida *gave* Romney, and that is its electoral votes.  While the other options are related to the situation, they aren't the most direct and accurate answer based on the passage.
"
"Na kotalela oyo eleki, Gingrich azalaki na pourcentage nini na maponami ya liboso?","The question is asking for Newt Gingrich's percentage of the vote, given the information provided.

*   Gingrich received 32% of the vote.
*   Mitt Romney received 46% of the vote.
*   The total number of votes is 100%.

The question states that Floride has given all its votes to Romney, and that Gingrich received 32% of the vote in the entire state.  The question is simply asking what Gingrich's percentage of the *total* votes is.

Therefore, the answer is **C: 32 pourcent**.  (Although this option isn't provided, I am noting the correct answer as 32%)
Since 32% is not among the options, the closest and repeated option is:

**A: 50 pourcent** (Assuming there was a typo in the provided answers, and this was meant to be a correct value)

**However, based strictly on the given information, none of the provided options are correct.** I suspect there is an error in the answer choices.

If we assume the question is tricking us and wants us to consider a different scenario - that Romney got all of the votes - the question would ask something else entirely. But as it stands, the answer is simply 32%.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani balongolaki ye nkombo, na nsima ya baresulta ya caucus?","The correct answer is **A: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Gingrich akumisaki Santorum..."" which translates to ""Gingrich won against Santorum...""  This indicates Gingrich was the one who performed well in the caucus.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani alobelaki mingi motu mosusu kolandana na résultat ya etuluku?","The correct answer is **C: Romney**.

The text states: ""Gingrich akumisaki Santorum, kasi alobaki maloba mabe mpona Romney, ebongo bato basalaki kampanie ya mabe mpona Gingrich na Iowa."" This directly indicates that Gingrich spoke negatively *about* Romney. Therefore, Gingrich is the one who spoke the most about someone else related to the outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bachmann:** The text says Bachmann ""azwi ekateli ya kosukisa esakoli na ye,"" which means she is known for seeking attention, but it doesn't state she spoke about someone related to the outcome.
* **B: Gingrich:** While Gingrich did speak about Romney, the question asks who spoke *most* about someone else. 
* **D: Perry:** Perry focused on the Texas caucus results and his own future prospects. He didn't speak negatively about anyone.



Therefore, the answer is **C: Romney**."
Esika kaka moko oyo elakiseli yango ezalaki wapi liboso ya 2015?,"The correct answer is **C: Radio ya AstroNet**.

The text states: ""Na suka ya 2015, TogiNet asalaki AstroNet Radio po ezala station ya mibale."" This translates to ""In 2015, TogiNet became AstroNet Radio to be a children's station."" Therefore, AstroNet Radio was the station in existence in 2015.
"
Radio ezali kotalisa masolo kozala na bibabulisi ya ndenge nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Eteyelo ya kala**.

The text states: """"teyatre ya radio ya eteyelo ya kala, na basango ya lokuta pe ezangi ntina!"""".  This translates to ""a radio theatre of the old style, with suspense and suspense!"" indicating a radio drama or radio play.
"
Eloko nini David Headley asangisaki oyo na nsuka esalisaki kobundisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Bato ya minduki (Armed men)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""bamemaki bagrenate, bibundeli ya automatique **mpe babetaka bisika mingi ata pe bato bazala na esika ya kozela engbunduka ya Chhatrapati Shivaji mpe hotel Taj Mahal oyo eyebana mingi**.""  This translates to ""they threw grenades, automatic rifles **and caused many casualties even among people who were at the scene of the Chhatrapati Shivaji bombing and the Taj Mahal hotel that was heavily affected**.""

David Headley orchestrated the attacks using armed men (bato ya minduki) to carry out the bombings and shootings. While grenades and automatic rifles were *used*, the core element he deployed was a team of armed individuals.
"
Motindo nini ya komema babundisi basalelaki mpo na kokende na Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nzela ya engbunduka (Road)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bato babomaki bato na Mumbai bakomaki na nzela ya masuwa na mokolo ya 26 sanza ya zomi na moko 2008..."" which translates to ""People were attacked in Mumbai who attacked in the market on December 26th, 2008...""  While the text mentions the market as the *location* of some of the attacks, it states they *attacked* *in* the market, implying the route of travel was by road.
"
Liloba nini ezali kolakisa malamu mbano ya lisano ya Nadal na Raonic na Brisbane Open oyo tolobeli na bokomi?,"The correct answer is **C: Nadal alongaki Raonic**.

The text states: ""Soki tokokanisi Nadal na Canada, alonga bango 7–2."" This means Nadal won against Raonic with a score of 7-2.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Raonic alongaki Nadal:** This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **B: Raonic azalaki na 88% ya bapwe:** This refers to Nadal's point percentage, not Raonic's.
* **D: Raonic azuaki 76 points:** This refers to the number of points Nadal won when he was tied, not Raonic's points.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, esika ya Nadal na Raonic ezalaki nini nsima ya eteni ya yambo?","The correct answer is **A: Raonic azalaki na 88% ya bapwe**.

The question asks about Raonic's performance *before* Nadal's match. The text states: ""Nadal azwaki ba point 88% na match wana..."" which means Raonic was the opponent *in a previous match* where Nadal won 88% of the points.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nadal alongaki na 76 pwe:** This refers to Nadal's performance *during* the match described in the question.
*   **C: Motango ezalaki 7-2:** This describes the score of the *current* match, not what happened before.
*   **D: Raonic alongaki Nadal:** This is false; the text says Nadal won the match 7-2, implying Raonic lost.

Therefore, the only option that accurately reflects Raonic's performance before the current match is **A**."
Nsango na lokota nini ezuami te na bobongisi misato ya sika ya Naked News?,"The correct answer is **D: Espagnol**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...lisanga oyo ya mikili mingi ezobimisa baprograme na Espagnole, na Italien, pe na lokota ya corée mpona television, internet pe batelefone ya maboko."" 

This translates to: ""...this large format broadcasts programs in Spanish, Italian, and Korean for television, internet and mobile phones.""

The question asks which language is *not* mentioned as a language the format broadcasts in.  It explicitly lists Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, the answer must be one of the remaining options. Since the question is phrased as ""Nsango na lokota nini ezuami te na bobongisi misato ya sika ya Naked News?"" which means ""Which language is not included in the two major languages of Naked News?"", and the text doesn't mention Japanese as a language they broadcast in, option C is incorrect.

Therefore, the only language NOT mentioned is Spanish.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nsango ya sika ya Naked News ekozala te wapi?","The correct answer is **B: internet**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...na television, internet pe batelefone ya maboko."" This translates to ""...on television, internet, and mobile phones."" Since the question asks where you can *see* their content, and the options are limited, the internet is the most encompassing and likely answer.  While they are on television and mobile phones, those are platforms *using* the internet.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Batelefone ya maboko (Mobile phones):** While they are on mobile phones, the internet is the overarching platform that delivers the content *to* the mobile phones.
*   **C: Bisika ya masano (Health facilities):** The text doesn't mention anything about health facilities.
*   **D: Télévision (Television):** Similar to mobile phones, television is a platform, but the internet is the primary way they distribute their content now.



"
Bawelani boni basilisaki te Giant Slalom ?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The question asks how many skiers out of 117 did *not* participate in the Giant Slalom race. The text states: ""na mobimba bato ya ski 45 na kati ya 117 na Giant Slalom balongaki te na lisano wana."" (approximately 45 out of 117 skiers did not participate in the Giant Slalom race).
"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali komonisa na bosikisiki mbano ya makokima mbangu na masano?","The correct answer is **B: Batu 45 oyo basalaka ski basilisaki te kopota mbangu na bango na Giant Slalom.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks where the text mentions a significant disparity in the number of competitors in a particular race.**
* **The text states: ""na mobimba bato ya ski 45 na kati ya 117 na Giant Slalom balongaki te na lisano wana.""** (roughly translates to ""almost 45 skiers out of 117 did not finish the Giant Slalom race."") This is a significant disparity.
* **Option B directly reflects this statement.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na momekano ya mbangu ya mibale, Carpenado asilisaki liboso ya mosani moko ya ski oyo autaki na Hongrie:** While true, this refers to Carpenado's performance and not the disparity in competitors.
* **C: Bato mingi oyo basalaka ski basilisaki Slalom ya monene koleka Slalom:** The text doesn't mention the number of competitors in Giant Slalom *compared* to Slalom. It focuses on the number of *unfinished* Giant Slalom races.
* **D: Carpenado azwaki esika ya zomi na Slalom:** This refers to Carpenado's position in Slalom, not a disparity in competitor numbers.



"
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi NBA ezwaki ekateli ya kopekisa?","The correct answer is **D: Ekipi ya basketi ya Utah Jazz**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""NBA ezwaki ekateli nsima wana mosani ya Utah Jazz bakangaki ye na maladi ya COVID-19."" This translates to ""NBA had to postpone this due to a COVID-19 case in the Utah Jazz team."" 

Therefore, the NBA had to postpone the game *because of* the Utah Jazz team.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ememaki na mitungisi ya NBA mpo na virus?","The correct answer is **D: Mosani moko ya Utah Jazz azwamaki na bokono** (One player from the Utah Jazz tested positive).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mosani ya Utah Jazz bakangaki ye na maladi ya COVID-19"" which translates to ""A player from the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Batu ya NBA bazwamaki na bokono** (NBA players tested positive): The passage only mentions one player from the Utah Jazz.
* **B: Basani mingi bazwaki bokono na lisano ya Utah Jazz** (Many players tested positive in the Utah Jazz camp): The passage specifically mentions *one* player.
* **C: Mosani moko ya Utah Jazz asalaki malamu te nsima ya kozwama na bokono** (One player from the Utah Jazz was not tested for COVID-19 before testing positive): This is incorrect because the passage states the player *tested* positive.



"
Nani akotisaki but ya kolonga masano mpo na Washington Capitals na lisano na Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text explicitly states: ""Passe ya liboso ya ntina na pokwa wana ezalaki passe ememaki na mongete ya kolonga match oyo moto ya sika Nicklas Backstrom..."" which translates to ""The most important pass in that goal was a pass made by the other player, Nicklas Backstrom...""
"
Nani akotisaki but na ye ya 60 ya eleko na match ya Capitals na Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaromir Jagr**.

The text explicitly states: ""...mongete na ye ya mibale ya butu wana ezalaki mongete na ye 60 ya eleko oyo, akomi mosani ya liboso oyo akotisi mingete 60 to koleka na eleko moko banda 1995-96, ntango **Jaromir Jagr na Mario Lemieux** basalaki likambo wana ya monene.""

While the question is a bit tricky in phrasing, it's asking who *previously* achieved the feat of getting 60 points in a season or more in a single season, which is what the text compares Ovechkin's performance to. The answer is Jaromir Jagr.
"
Ntango nini banque ya Northern Rock ezalaki na bosenga ya lisalisi ya gouvernement?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntango banque ekabwanaki na bokambi ya biloko ya kopanyi.**

The text states: ""Northern Rock azalaki na mposa ya lisalisi na ntango akendaki na hypothécaires ya likama na 2007."" This means Northern Rock was in a precarious financial situation and facing potential collapse due to its investments in mortgages. This precariousness led to the government needing to intervene.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nsima ya kozongisa banque kozala ya ekolo:** While the government's intervention was ultimately to stabilize the bank, the immediate trigger wasn't simply to ""fix"" it in a general sense. It was a more specific financial crisis.
* **C: Nsima Virgin Group esombaki banque:** Virgin's attempt to acquire Northern Rock was a *response* to the bank's crisis, not the *cause* of the government's intervention.  And the Virgin Group didn't take over the company in the way the question implies.
* **D: Na ntango ya mpasi ya lifuti ya mbongo:** This option is not mentioned in the provided text.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki makambo oyo Virgin Group esalaki na banque ya Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **A: Virgin Group esombaki mpe oyo ekambaka biloko ya kopanyi ya Northern Rock**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Virgin, led by Sir Richard Branson, was ""very keen to buy the bank"" when Northern Rock was struggling. This implies a desire to acquire a stake in, or even the entirety of, the bank.
* The text also mentions Virgin wanting to run a ""good bank"" out of the remaining parts of Northern Rock, which clearly signifies a desire to be involved in the bank's operation.
* Options B, C, and D are not supported by the information provided. The text doesn't indicate Virgin initially wanted to run the whole bank, provide emergency support related to the mortgage crisis, or take full ownership to restructure it. It highlights a desire to participate in its future.



"
Ndenge elobami na bokomi ekolo nini ezali kotungisama na botiami maboko na boyokani ya klima ya Kyoto?,"The correct answer is **A: États Unis (United States)**.

The text states that the US, under President Rudd, withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol because it believed it would harm the US economy significantly, while countries like India and China wouldn't bear a significant burden. Therefore, the US is the reason for the withdrawal.
"
Bokonzi ya kala ya Australie ekanisaki ete kondimama ya Kyoto ekosala nini mabe?,"The correct answer is **A: États-Unis**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ekateli ya M. Rudd ya kotia maboko na boyokani ya Kyoto na boyokani ya Kyoto na Etats-Unis yango moko... Boyangeli ya kala ya ba conservateur eboyi kondima Kyoto, elobi ete ekobebisa nkita po yango esimbami mingimingi na koteka charbon, kasi mikili neti Inde na Chine endimaki te makama ya kobebisa mokili.""

This translates to: ""Mr. Rudd's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and the Kyoto Protocol with the United States... Old conservatives argue that the Kyoto Protocol would significantly harm its economy because it would limit coal consumption, but India and China do not contribute much to global emissions.""

The passage highlights the *United States'* concerns about the economic impact of the Kyoto Protocol, specifically regarding coal consumption.  Therefore, the answer is that the US was concerned about it.

Options B, C, and D are related to the issue, but the passage explicitly links the concern about the Kyoto Protocol's negative effects to the *United States*.
"
Ebongeseli nini bazuaki bakangifoto mpo na yangompo nampo na?,"The correct answer is **B: Ebongeseli ya bobateli mpe bomengo ya parc (The range and park knowledge)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the photo takers were brought in by a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. to ""engager les personnes de la Sporting Shooters Association"" (engage people from the Sporting Shooters Association).  This implies they needed to understand the range (where the shooting happens) and the park itself to effectively communicate with and engage the members of the Sporting Shooters Association.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebongeseli ya lisanga ya bakangifotoya masano ya Australie (The Australian Photography Association):**  The text doesn't mention the Australian Photography Association.
* **C: Ebongeseli ya NPWS (The NPWS):** While NPWS initiated the collaboration, the photo takers weren't *specifically* meant to represent or focus solely on NPWS.
* **D: Ebongeseli ya kobundisa banyama ya Sporting Shooters Association (To rehabilitate the animals of the Sporting Shooters Association):** The text discusses the animals being threatened by hunters, not needing rehabilitation. The goal is to engage with the hunters, not rehabilitate animals associated with them.



"
Liloba nini ezali komonisa na bosikisiki te momekano ya kopekisa banyama mabe?,"The correct answer is **C: Bato oyo babetaki masasi bazalaki kotambwisama na babateli zamba**.

Here's why:

The text states that due to the concerns raised by the animal welfare activists and the subsequent meetings between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association, the activists were met with **""malako ya mobimba na oyo etali libateli mpe formation""** (harsh treatment from those who were against them and the formation). This implies the activists were actively confronting or engaging with the opposing side, leading to conflict and tension.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lokola ezalaki momekano ya liboso ya ebongeseli yango, batalelaki yango te** (Because it's a general freedom of expression, we didn't interfere): This is irrelevant to the specific situation described, which is about confrontation and backlash.
* **B: Bato oyo bazalaki kobeta masasi bazalaki kozwa mateya ya koyekola** (Those who are advocating are creating a desire to escape): This doesn't align with the text, which focuses on the conflict and harassment the activists experienced.
* **D: Baponaki bato minei oyo bazalaki kobeta masasi** (They met with many people who were advocating): While it's true they met with many people, the core issue isn't *meeting* them, but the *interactions* and the resulting negative consequences.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi bokabwani ezwamaki?","The correct answer is **A: Na Rift Valley**.

The text states: ""maloba ya moto moko ya bolukiluki na Rift Valley Research Service na Ethiopie..."" which directly translates to ""opinion of a researcher at Rift Valley Research Service in Ethiopia...""  The question asks *where* the phenomenon was observed.

While D (Ethiopie) is mentioned, the more precise location is the Rift Valley. Option C refers to the molecule's structure, which is not where the phenomenon was observed.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, nini elobami te lokola eloko ekoki kotinda banyama ya zamba basala yo mabe?","The correct answer is **C: Botaleli ya bilembeteli moléculaires (Molecular interactions)**.

Here's why:

The quote states: ""Elimboli ete bokabwani ebandaka liboso mpenza koleka ndenge tokanisaka yango na bilembeteli ya molecule."" This translates to: ""It is believed that the bond is much stronger than how we connect it to the molecule's chemical bonds.""

The implication is that the *strength of the molecular interactions* is the key factor in what allows the thing being discussed (likely a difficult-to-see or harmful substance) to persist and potentially harm animals. The other options are not directly addressed:

* **A: Bokutani ya biloko ya kala (Accumulation of old things):** This is not mentioned in the quote.
* **B: Bokabwani yango (Its bonding):** While bonding is involved, the quote emphasizes the *strength* of the interaction *with the molecule's chemical bonds*, not just bonding in general.
* **D: Bolukiluki oyo esalemaki na Rift Valley (This research done in the Rift Valley):**  The research location is the context, not the explanation of *what* allows the substance to be harmful.



Therefore, the quote highlights the powerful nature of **molecular interactions** as the reason why something is so difficult to eliminate and can pose a threat.



"
Nini ekosenga mosani asala mpo na kosala muvema na ntango ya lisano ya vidéo?,"The correct answer is **C: Tia oyo ezozua pene ya télévision na bango**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller uses sensors *outside* the TV to detect its position.  The question asks how to play video games. Since the controller uses sensors outside the TV, the answer must involve positioning the controller relative to the TV.  Option C directly reflects this - it says to ""point it at the TV.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sala ete ezolandela ezala pene ya ya console:**  The passage says the sensors are *outside* the console, not *on* it.
* **B: Tia bango lokola triangle:** While the controller can make a triangle shape, this isn't how it's used to *play* the games. The passage focuses on positioning.
* **D: Tambolisa oyo ezolanda na kati ya mopepe:** The controller doesn't use wireless communication *to play*; it uses sensors outside the TV.



"
Nini esalemaki mpo ezala lokola télécommande ya v?,"The correct answer is **D: Console ya Révolution ya Nintendo**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller resembles a TV remote.  Option D directly states it *is* the controller for the Nintendo Revolution console. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oyo mibale bazozua yao yo ezolanda** (These sensors will be wireless): The passage doesn't mention wireless capabilities.
* **B: Oyo ezolanda ya Révolution Nintendo** (This is the remote of the Nintendo Revolution): While related, this is too specific. The controller *is* part of the Revolution console.
* **C: Lisolo ya ntina mingi** (A lot of technology):  This is too general and doesn't specifically answer what the controller *is*.



"
Nini elobamaki te na rapport ya sika ya biro ya sango Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **C: Balekisi mpepo yango na Afghanistan**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what the Xinhua news agency report states.
* The report clearly states that the agency reports that ""they"" (likely referring to a group or entity) are ""shipping wind"" (mpepo) and ""deploying it"" (bazongisaki yango) in Afghanistan, specifically in Kandahar. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mpepo yango ezwaki likama ya kobwaka bombe (The wind is a means of blowing bombs):** While the report mentions ""bombe"" (bombs), it doesn't say the wind *is* the means of blowing them. It implies the wind is used in conjunction with bombs in some way.
* **B: Mpepo yango ekitanaki na Ürümqi (The wind is in Ürümqi):** The report mentions wind being deployed *in* Ürümqi, but the main point of the report is the deployment in Afghanistan.
* **D: Mpepo yango ekitaki na Kandahar (The wind is in Kandahar):** The report says the wind is *being deployed* in Kandahar, not that it *is* in Kandahar.



"
Nini elobamaki te na rapport ya liboso ya biro ya sika ya Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Baboyaki mpepo yango ekita na mbalakaka**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what the Xinhua report *says*.
* The text states: ""Barapore ya kala elobi ete babotolaka mpepo mpe bazongisaka yango na Afghanistan, ntango baboyaki kopesa bango nzela ya kokita na mbalakaka na Ürümqi."" (The previous reports stated they bottled and transported the gas to Afghanistan, where they used it to attack with a bomb in Ürümqi.)

This clearly indicates the report is saying the gas was used to cause an explosion.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazwaki mpɛpɔ yango na makasi** (They are increasing it significantly): The text doesn't say the amount is increasing, just that it was used in an attack.
* **C: Balekisakiango lisusu na Afghanistan** (They are launching more attacks in Afghanistan): The text states the gas was used in *one* attack in Afghanistan, not that they are launching more.
* **D: Mpepo yango ezwaki likama ya kobwaka bombe** (The gas is a bomb-making material): While the gas *was used* in a bomb, the report doesn't state that the gas itself is a component of bomb-making materials.
"
Nini esakolamaki na Sara Danius na ntango ya programme ya radio?,"The correct answer is **D: Komite ekotika milende mpo na kosala boyokani na Bob Dylan.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Danius alobaki ete, """"Sikoyo tozosala eloko moko te. Nabengi mpe natindi mikanda na baninga na ye ya makasi mpe nazwi biyano ya malamu mpenza. Sikoyo, ekoki mpenza."""" This translates to: ""Danius said, ""We won't give up. I have great respect for him and have a great admiration for his work. He's capable.""""

The key phrase is ""ekotika milende mpona kosala boyokani na ye"" which means ""will make efforts to reach out to him"" or ""will try to communicate with him.""  Option D accurately reflects this.
"
Nani akokaki te kokutana na ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The text explicitly states that Sara Danius ""alobaki na miso ya bato na manaka moko ya radio na lisanga ya Radio ya Suede, azokoka te kosolola na Bob Dylan mbala moko mpona koyebisa ye ete alongi mbano ya Nobel ya kokoma ya 2016.""  This translates to ""said in an interview on Radio Sweden that she didn't manage to contact Bob Dylan once to inform him that she was proposing him for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016.""

Therefore, Bob Dylan is the one who couldn't be contacted.
"
Nani alobaki ete elaka yango ezali “litambe monene”?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**. 

The text states, ""Molobeli ya Bush, Gordon Johndroe, abengaki komipesa ya Corée ya nordi """"etambe monene mpona kokokisa mokano ya kolongola mandoki ya nikleyere na esanga ya Corée."""""" This translates to ""Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndroe, said that it is a 'significant step towards resolving the nuclear issue in Korea.'""  

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe used the phrase ""litambe monene"" (significant step).
"
Słania ebimisaki batimbre boni mpo na bikolo mingi?,"The text states: ""Asalaki batimbre koleka 1 000 mpona Suède na mikili 28 mosusu."" This translates to ""He issued more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden in 28 years.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: koleka 1000** (more than 1000).
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kozala ntina ya kokoba kotanga uta na bisika ya kopelisa mopepe ya batono?","The correct answer is **A: Esika ya bokangami ya mibale oyo ezali kotondisama na makoki (The failure is due to the aging of the pipes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the pipeline is 800 miles long and has been in operation for a long time.  This implies the pipes are old and susceptible to failure due to wear and tear. The description of the tank's situation (""vizipeli ya réservoir ezalaki kaka kobimisa mai ya biloko oyo ezalaki na kati na yango"" - the tank's lid is only venting the contents inside) and the fact that the backup tanks aren't enough suggests a significant leak is happening. Old, aging pipes are the most likely reason for such a large leak.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Momekano ya mbala na mbala ya ndenge moto ezosala (Human error in operation):** While human error *could* contribute, the scale of the leak points to a more systemic problem.  It's less likely that a single mistake would cause such a significant loss.
* **C: Bopanzani ya molunge (Earthquake):** The passage doesn't mention any seismic activity.
* **D: Moto oyo ezikaki na moko ya bisika ya pompe ya Fort Greely (Someone working at one of the pump stations at Fort Greely):**  The passage focuses on the pipeline and tank system, not on the personnel at the pump stations.



Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the information given is that the pipeline's age and resulting pipe degradation is the cause of the problem.



"
Mpo na nini bisika ya kokanga efungwamaki?,"The correct answer is **A: Ezalaki na bopanzani ya molunge na kati ya batono** (It's due to a crack in the middle of the tank).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bizipeli ya réservoir ezalaki kaka kobimisa mai ya biloko oyo ezalaki na kati na yango."" (The reservoir's seams are only allowing the contents inside to leak out.) This indicates a crack or weakness in the tank itself, not related to external factors like a lack of maintenance, people being inside, or the earth's movement.  The wording suggests a failure *within* the tank's structure.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate explanation based on the provided text.
"
"Sikawa, mai ezali likoló boni na The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Ekómaka tii na loketo (It's unknown)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states the water reached up to 100 feet in depth.** It *doesn't* say the water level was a specific distance, like 20 miles, 6 inches, or 100 miles, in The Ninth Ward.
* **The question asks where the water level was in The Ninth Ward.**  The text only gives the maximum depth of the water (100 feet), but doesn't specify locations within The Ninth Ward.

Therefore, the best answer is that the exact water level in The Ninth Ward is unknown based on the provided text.



"
"Na ntango ya mopɛpɛ makasi Katrina, nini esalemaki na The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **A: Mai ya mpela ezalaki na bonene ya metre 100**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Ndako ya libwa, oyo mai ekotelaka yango kino na 20 feet na ntango ya mopepe makasi Katrina, eza sikoyo na mai kino na loketo po mwa libulu ya mai ya pene etondaki mpenza. Mai ezopanza na libulu oyo eza na eteni oyo mnene na yango eza 100 feet.""  This translates to: ""The levees, which were over 20 feet high during Hurricane Katrina, were filled with water due to the surge of floodwater. However, the breach in these levees was 100 feet wide.""

Therefore, the levee breach was 100 feet wide. Option A reflects this. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi endimisamaki te na Hamilton?","The correct answer is **C: Soki mokanda ya kosala elandamaki (If the patient's condition worsens)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the patient's condition is mild.** The hospital is taking precautions, but it's *because* the risk of spreading Ebola is a concern.
* **Options A, B, and D are all relevant concerns in a situation like this:**
    * **A: Esika oyo mobeli yango asalaki mobembo (If the patient's condition worsens):** This is a primary concern.  A worsening condition would significantly increase the risk of Ebola transmission.  The hospital's precautions are designed to prevent this escalation.
    * **B: Likoki ya kozwa mobeli mosusu na virus (The possibility of further viral mutation):** This is always a concern with viruses, including Ebola. Mutation could make the virus more contagious or resistant to treatment.
    * **D: Ezalela ya mobeli ya lelo (Current viral strain):** Knowing the specific strain is important for understanding its behavior and developing appropriate treatments.

However, the question asks what is *not* addressed or mentioned as a specific concern *in the passage*. The passage focuses on the mild nature of the illness and the precautions taken *to prevent spread*.  The other options are all potential concerns, but not explicitly highlighted in the text. Therefore, the best answer is the one that represents a potential concern *not specifically mentioned* in the passage.

**The passage emphasizes the existing mildness of the disease and the measures taken to avoid further complications, rather than speculating on potential future scenarios or broader viral characteristics.** Therefore, the condition worsening is the primary concern *not explicitly addressed* within the provided context.



"
Nini ezali likambo oyo batu ya siansi balingi koyeba?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndenge nini Mabele esalemaki**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bato ya siansi bakanisi bakoyeba ndenge baplanete esalemaka, mingimingi ndenge Mabele esalemaki..."" (Scientists know how planets are formed, mostly how Earth was formed...).  This directly indicates that scientists are trying to understand the formation of Earth (Mabele).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntango mioto ekutanaki na Mabele** (When life meets Earth): While important, the passage doesn't focus on this. It's more about the planet's origins.
* **B: Ndenge oyo baproteini esalemaka** (How proteins are formed): This is related to biology, not the formation of Earth.
* **C: Eloko organique ezali nini** (What organic matter is): This is a question about the composition of matter, not the formation of the planet itself.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mosala nini bapolisi ya mboka basalaki na bokangami?","The correct answer is **A: Basengaki na FBI ete esala bokangami yango** (They informed the FBI that it was a hoax).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mituka ebendaka biloko basalelaki yango mpona kokanga nzela ya kokotela mpe bapolisi 80 basalisaka na koyeba bashofere ya bamoto baleka na nzela mosusu. Balobeli te retard ya kotambola na bisika ya pembeni, nzela ya mibale ya engumba."" (The hoaxers were trying to create a way to get attention and 80 police officers were deployed to find drivers who left the road. They said it wasn't a problem with driving on the shoulder, the highway.)

This implies the police realized it was a staged event (""hoax"") to create a problem.  The phrase ""Basengaki na FBI ete esala bokangami yango"" directly states this conclusion and their communication with the FBI about it.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Bazwaki ekateli ya kosala bokangami** (They were obligated to conduct a hoax): This is incorrect.  The passage implies the police recognized it as a fake.
* **C: Bazalaki kotambwisa bato oyo bazalaki kotambwisa mituka na banzela mosusu** (They were investigating people who were trying to create hoaxes in other ways): While possible, the passage focuses on *this specific* hoax.
* **D: Balobaki ete mituka eumelaki na nzela mosusu** (They said the hoax was happening in another way): This is not supported by the text. The text suggests they realized the events were staged.



"
Nini esalemaki na esika ya kokotisa tiyo ntango ya bokangami?,"The correct answer is **B: Bazalaki kosalela yango lokola nzela ya kopengwisa** (They were using it as a way to smuggle things).

Here's why:

* The passage states the transport organization in Maryland was used to smuggle drugs and was linked to the FBI. 
* The police discovered 80 officers were involved in letting drivers leave the highway.
* This strongly implies the highway was used for illegal activities like smuggling.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Bazalaki kokanga bango** (They were hiring them) - While possible, the context heavily suggests a criminal enterprise, not simply hiring people.
* **C: Bazalaki polele mpo na bakumbi mituka** (They were protecting multiple families) - This doesn't fit the context of drug smuggling and police intervention.
* **D: Ezalaki na mituka mingi oyo ezalaki komema** (There were many people who were involved) - While likely, the question asks *what they were using it for*, not just who was involved.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esalemaki te liboso ete motuka ebeta moto oyo akangaki fotó?","The correct answer is **B: Moto oyo azwaki bafɔtɔ atɛlɛmisaki motuka na ye pembeni Sepulveda Boulevard.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""...moto akangaka bafoto atelemisaki motuka na ye na ngambo oyo mosusu ya balabala Sepulveda pe alukaki kokanga bafoto ya biro ya bapolisi liboso ya kokatisa pe kokoba nzela na ye...""  This means the photographer was near Sepulveda Boulevard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mokangami ya foto azwaki mitindo na Highway Patrol ete azonga na ngambo mosusu ya nzela:** While the Highway Patrol is involved, this option doesn't pinpoint *where* the photographer was taking pictures.
* **C: Moto oyo azwaki bafɔtɔ azwaki bafɔtɔ ya esika oyo bapolisi etelemaka:**  The text says the photographer took pictures *of the police offices*, not necessarily *at* the locations where police were already present.
* **D: Moto oyo azwaki bafoto yango alongaki kozwa fotó ya Bieber:** While the photographer is taking pictures of Bieber, the text doesn't specify that the pictures are *specifically* *for* Bieber. The focus is on the photographer's behavior and the police response.



"
Mokangami ya bafoto azalaki komeka kosala nini liboso ete motuka ebɛta ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Telemisa motuka Sepulveda Boulevard**.

The text states: ""moto akangaka bafoto atelemisaki motuka na ye na ngambo oyo mosusu ya balabala Sepulveda..."" which translates to ""the person took photos while filming the car on Sepulveda Boulevard...""
"
Liloba nini ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki te ezalela ya ndenge ya mokambi ya ekolo azuaki nsima na kozwama na virus?,"The correct answer is **A: Azali koyoka malamu te (It's not playing lightly)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Longola fievre na mongongo mpasi, naza malamu mpe nakoki kosala mosala na ngai na mosika."" This translates to ""He has a high fever and a severe cough, but I am well and can continue working.""  This indicates that the virus is serious enough to cause significant symptoms (fever and cough), but Arias himself isn't taking it lightly and is still trying to work.  Option A, ""Azali koyoka malamu te,"" captures this nuance of not treating the virus as something to be taken lightly.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Azali na mpasi na zolo (It's in a bad state):** While the virus is causing symptoms, the text doesn't explicitly say the *virus itself* is in a bad state. It's the *person* infected who is experiencing symptoms.
* **C: Azali kotungisama teétat stable (It's not stabilizing a stable state):** This doesn't directly relate to the virus's severity or its impact on Arias.
* **D: Azali na nzoto moto (It's very strong):**  The text mentions symptoms, but doesn't specify the *strength* of the virus itself.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, maloba oyo elandi na ntinan oyo etali président, oyo wapi ezali ya solo?","The correct answer is **A: Azali na nzoto moto te** (He is in a remote location).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...sante ya president eza malamu, kasi akomifandela na ndako na ye moko mpona mikolo mawa mingi."" This translates to ""...the president's health is good, but he is staying in his own home for many days.""  The phrase ""na ndako na ye moko"" means ""in his own home"" and the context implies isolation due to illness. Option A, ""Azali na nzoto moto te"" (He is in a remote location) best captures this sense of isolation and being away from public view.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Akotikala na ndako na boumeli ya bapɔsɔ mingi** (He is in the home of many doctors): The text doesn't mention doctors being in the president's home.
*   **C: Azali malamu mpo na kosala mosala na ye na mosika** (He is well enough to conduct his affairs privately): While he's stated to be well enough to conduct affairs privately, the primary implication is that he's isolating.
*   **D: Azali na ndenge moko ya makasi ya virus** (He is in a very severe stage of the virus): The text mentions fever and cough, but doesn't state the virus is severe. It only states his health is *good* despite the symptoms.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini mopepe makasi Gonu esengelaki kokoba kolɛmba?","The correct answer is **D: Liboso ya kokóma na mipɛpɛ ya kilomɛtrɛ 149 na ngonga moko**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *when* the Gonu hurricane *would* start to weaken.
* The provided text states the hurricane's maximum speed is 240 km/h.
* The text also states the current speed is 83 km/h and weakening.
* The key point is that hurricanes weaken when they lose their energy.  This happens when they move over cooler waters.
* The option ""D"" directly relates to the hurricane weakening as it loses its intensity (speed) and moving at a slower pace compared to its peak.  It's implying the weakening is related to a decrease in its overall power and therefore, its ability to maintain its maximum speed of 149 miles per hour.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Liboso ya kokóma na Maldives:**  While being over land *does* weaken a hurricane, the text mentions the hurricane is currently over the Maldives, and the question is about *when* it would weaken, not *if* it would weaken over land.
* **B: Ntango mipepe ekitanaki tii na kilomɛtrɛ soki 83 na ngonga moko:** The current speed (83 km/h) is *already* lower than the maximum speed (240 km/h). The question asks *when* it weakens, not *when* it drops to 83 km/h.
* **C: Liboso ya kokóma na nsonge na yango:** Similar to option A, being over land is a weakening factor, but the question is about *when* the weakening begins, not the condition that causes it.



"
Mipepe ezalaki mbangu ndenge nini na nsɔngɛ ya mopepe makasi Gonu?,"The correct answer is **B: 240 miles par heure**.

The text states: ""mopepe makasi Gonu, euti na nkombo ya saki moko ya makasa ya nzete ya mbila na lokota ya Maldives, ekomaki na vitese ya makasi ya **bakilometele 240 na ngonga moko** (149 miles na ngonga moko).""  This directly translates to the storm's maximum speed being 240 kilometers per hour (or 149 miles per hour).
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi etalelami te lokola ezaleli ya Karenia brevis?","The correct answer is **D: Esalemaka na ndenge ya bomoto** (It multiplies in a biological way).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Makambo ya bozalisi ekoki kosangana mpona kobimisa makambo ebongi, mpe kopesa nzela na biloko wana ekomi ebele mpenza."" (The problem can grow to cause a lot of harm, and it provides a way for these things to become very numerous.) This indicates a biological reproduction/growth process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezali lolenge moko ya ba algues** (It is only a type of algae): While it *is* a type of algae, the passage focuses on its harmful effects, not just its classification.  The specific harm to humans is the key point.
* **B: Ekoki kopekisa misisa ya bato** (It can cause serious illness): The passage *does* mention it can cause illness, but this is a consequence, not the core biological process being described in the context of its spread.
* **C: Ezali na ba cellules ebele** (It has many cells): The passage doesn't directly state that it has many cells, but rather that it multiplies and spreads.  Having many cells is a result of biological reproduction, but not the defining characteristic being discussed.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **D**.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi Karena brevis azali na makoki ya kosala te?","The correct answer is **D: Kobimisa neurotoxine moko (Producing a single neurotoxin)**.

Here's why:

The text states that *Karenia brevis* produces multiple neurotoxins.  The question asks what *Karenia brevis* *cannot* do, given the information. Since it produces *multiple* toxins, it *cannot* only produce a single one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Désactiver ba nerfs na mbisi (Disable nerves in fish):** The text mentions that the toxins affect marine life, causing fish deaths. Disabling nerves is a plausible mechanism of action for a neurotoxin.
*   **B: Bobakisa noki na motango na nse ya ezalela nyonso (Kill all life in the entire ecosystem):**  While the toxins are harmful, the text doesn't suggest they cause ecosystem collapse.  It focuses on fish kills and effects on humans.
*   **C: Kosala bopusi likoló na mai (Reproduce continuously in water):** The text implies that *Karenia brevis* blooms and releases toxins. Continuous reproduction is not mentioned as a characteristic or limitation.



Therefore, the best answer is **D**.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalemaki te mpo na mopɛpɛ makasi Félicia?","The correct answer is **C: Nkake oyo ezongaka mbala na mbala (Rain that falls intermittently)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bitiki na yango ebimisaka mwa bambula na bisanga mingi, kasi sikoyo, bayebisi te ete soki ebeba to mai etonda kuna. Mai oyo ekomaki kino 6,34 inches na gauge na Oahu, balobaki ete eza """"ntina"""". Mbula misusu ezalaka na bakake mpe mbala mingi na mikalikali.""

This translates to: ""...its winds are strong, but it is not expected to make landfall. The rain that fell in Oahu was 6.34 inches, and it was described as ""intermittent"".  More rain is expected in large amounts and frequently in showers.""

The text highlights that the rain associated with Hurricane Felicia is expected to be frequent and come in showers (""mbala mingi na mikalikali"").  The other options are not directly mentioned or supported by the text.



"
Maloba nini oyo elobeli mopepe makasi Felicia ezali lokuta?,"The correct answer is **A: Mbula oyo ebɛtaki yango epesaki Oahu matomba**.

Here's why:

* The text states ""Mai oyo ekomaki kino 6,34 inches na gauge na Oahu, balobaki ete eza """"ntina""""."" This directly indicates that the storm caused flooding in Oahu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezalaki liboso na catégorie lokola dépression tropicale avant ebongwana na tempête ya catégorie 4:** The text doesn't say this. It only mentions it's a Category 4 hurricane *now*.
* **C: Mingi ya bisanga yango emonanaki na mbula:** While the storm is causing damage, the text focuses on the flooding in Oahu, not general widespread damage.
* **D: Mbula ebetaki mwa moke elongo na nkake:** This is not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the provided text.
"
Liloba nini ezali komonisa na bosikisiki mbano ya Grand Prix ya Hongrie na 2009?,"The correct answer is **C: Babenganaki Piquet Jr. na mosala nsima na yango**.

The text states: ""Piquet Jr. balongoki ye na mosala nsima ya Grand Prix ya Hongrie ya 2009."" which translates to ""Piquet Jr. was penalized at the start of the Grand Prix of Hungary in 2009.""



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fernando Alonso azwaki likama** (Fernando Alonso had an accident) - The text doesn't mention Alonso having an accident.
*   **B: Piquet Jr. nde azwaki elonga yango** (Piquet Jr. was the one who got the penalty) - While true, the question asks *what happened* at the start, and the answer is that he was penalized.
*   **D: Motuka ya libateli ezwaki likama** (The car was damaged) - The text doesn't say the car was damaged. It only mentions a penalty.



"
Likama yango ekweaki ntango nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Mbala moko sima ya pit stop ya Alonso**.

Here's why:

The text states that Piquet Jr. intentionally crashed during the pit stop of Fernando Alonso at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix.  This is explicitly mentioned as the reason for the crash. The text also confirms Piquet Jr.'s confession later.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ntango mituka mosusu ezalaki kopesa esansi:** The text doesn't mention this as the reason for the crash.
*   **C: Liboso motuka ya bokengi ebima:** This is too broad and not specific to the situation described.
*   **D: Nsima Piquet akoti mpo nampo na carburant:** The text says Piquet Jr. crashed *to help Alonso*, not because of a fuel issue.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezwaki ntango moke koleka oyo balukiluki bakanisaki na ebandeli?","The correct answer is **C: Kobota kati na mitindo ndenge na ndenge (Convergent evolution)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how different species on the Galapagos Islands developed similar beak shapes.** This is a classic example of convergent evolution.  Different species (Darwin's finches) faced similar environmental pressures (food sources) and evolved similar solutions (beak shapes) independently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bokeli ya lolenge ya nyama (Sexual selection):**  Sexual selection is driven by mate choice, not necessarily the development of similar physical traits in unrelated species.
* **B: Bokeli ya kopesa ya nyama (Adaptive radiation):** While adaptive radiation *can* lead to diverse species with different adaptations, the passage specifically highlights the *similarity* of beak shapes despite the species being different.  Adaptive radiation is a broader process.
* **D: Evolution ya espèce ya bikelamu (Evolution of bird species):** While the passage focuses on the evolution of bird species, the key concept being illustrated is *how* they evolved – through convergent evolution, not just their evolution in general.



Therefore, **Convergent evolution (C)** best captures the core concept the passage is explaining."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobamaki te na balukiluki?","The correct answer is **B: Bolai ya mosala ya evolisyo (The branch of evolutionary biology)**.

Here's why:

* The passage discusses the **evidence** for evolution (Darwin's finches) and the **mechanisms** behind it (adaptive radiation driven by beak shape). 
*  The question asks *where* the passage *doesn't* discuss evolution. While the passage *is about* evolution, it *doesn't directly address* the broader field of evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology is a larger discipline encompassing all aspects of evolutionary processes, not just specific examples or mechanisms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esika oyo lolenge ya sika ya banyama esalemaki (Where the beak adaptation of animals occurred):** The passage explicitly discusses the beak adaptations of finches in the Galapagos.
* **C: Nkombo ya lolenge ya sika (The mechanism of beak adaptation):** The passage explains how beak shape changes are driven by environmental pressures and the availability of food sources.
* **D: Bandeke oyo ekotaka na mosala ya kobota (The species involved in the evolutionary process):** The passage names specific finch species (Darwin's finches) and a cactus, which are key to illustrating adaptive radiation.



"
CowParade ekosalema wapi?,"The correct answer is **B: Na engumba Bucarest**.

The passage states: ""Milulu ya art eza mpe na kati ya kampanie ya marie ya engumba Bucarest..."" which translates to ""Art installations are also part of the campaign of the Bucharest city hall...""

While CowParade takes place in many parts of Romania and is generally in Southeastern Europe, the passage specifically mentions Bucharest as a location.
"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki CowParade?","The correct answer is **B: Esalemaki na Ndako ya Bokonzi ya Bucarest City Hall**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Milulu ya art eza mpe na kati ya kampanie ya marie ya engumba Bucarest...eza na bato ya ndenge na ndenge."" This means the art installation is part of the Bucharest City Hall's campaign.
* While the other options touch on elements of CowParade (its location in Southeast Europe, its scale), they don't directly answer *where* it's happening.
* Option B specifically identifies the location: the Bucharest City Hall.



"
Nini esalaki ete Russie etelemisa kosalela ba avions II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Likama moko** (One engine).

The text explicitly states that on the 7th day of the flight, one engine caught fire, causing the plane to land and rescue the crew. This indicates a problem with a single engine, not the other options.
"
II-76 ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Engbunduka moko (An airplane)**.

The text describes the Il-76 as a large military transport aircraft.  The options provided don't directly list ""airplane,"" but ""engbunduka moko"" is the closest equivalent in Lingala.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Masuwa moko ezali na nse ya mai (A single lake)** - This has nothing to do with the Il-76.
* **B: Tono moko (A single person)** -  The Il-76 is a machine, not a person.
* **C: Mpepo moko (A single wind)** - The Il-76 is an aircraft, not a weather phenomenon.



"
Nani azwaki ekipi ya bakomi mpo na The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

The text states: ""Na 1989, asalisaki na kosala Simpsons elongo na Brooks pe Groening..."" This translates to ""In 1989, he started The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening...""  Therefore, Groening was one of the creators and a key figure in the show's development and success.
"
"Engebene Fluke, nani azalaki kotindela ye makanisi ya malamu mpe kolendisa ye?","The correct answer is **B: Misala ya bokolongono ya basi (Bus maintenance services)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Fluke is used by many people to diagnose problems with buses that are not working properly.
* It further mentions that Fluke is used by mechanics and repair shops, and that they use it to identify issues with the engine that cause buses to break down.

Therefore, those who use Fluke to diagnose bus problems are mechanics and repair shops, which fall under the category of **misala ya bokolongono ya basi (bus maintenance services)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Minganga (Doctors):** Doctors are not typically involved in diagnosing or repairing buses.
* **C: Mibali (Drivers):** Drivers operate the buses but are not responsible for diagnosing mechanical problems.
* **D: Nyoso mibali na basi (Bus accessories):** Bus accessories are parts *of* the bus, not the entities that use Fluke to diagnose problems.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bato mosusu balingaki te basi baloba na ntina na nini?","The correct answer is **C: Bokolongono ya basi** (Brake system of buses).

Here's why:

* The passage states that people were using the Fluke Akomaki to test the **brake system** of buses because the brakes weren't working properly. 
* The passage also mentions they were showing the device to mechanics and experts, emphasizing its use in diagnosing brake problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Batu mokomoko ya mibali** (Bus drivers): While bus drivers are involved, the passage focuses on the *system* itself, not just the drivers.
* **B: Kofuta nkisi** (Cleaning the device): The device's purpose isn't cleaning, it's testing.
* **D: Libaku** (Lights): The passage doesn't mention lights being the problem.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nzoto nini ya planɛti ezali na nguya mingi?","The correct answer is **A: Mabele**.

The text states: ""...nkombo na yango eza Mabele,"" which translates to ""...its ring is made of Mabe.""  Therefore, the ring is made of Mabe.
"
Bibale mpe mabeke oyo ezali na mai oyo ezali polele emonisami na nzoto nini ya planeti?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The text explicitly states: ""nkombo na yango eza Mabele,"" which translates to ""its ring is made of ice.""  This is a key characteristic of Titan, Saturn's largest moon.  The text also compares the speed of the ocean to ""ndenge mai ezali"" (how water is), and states that it is as fast as it is, suggesting it's an ocean-like body. 

The text also says the ocean's speed is ""kaka ndenge mai ezali"" which means as fast as water. It further says it is as fast as ""ndenge mai ezali"" (how water is) and is located in a ""nzoto moko oyo elakisaka makasi mingi koleka Titan"". This implies that the ocean's properties are similar to those of Titan's surface.

Therefore, the answer is Titan.
"
Nini kati na makambo oyo bamoni ezali te mbuma ya bokutani ya nsala?,"The correct answer is **C: Bososoli ya evolisyo ya nsala (Evolution of feathers)**.

Here's why:

The text discusses the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs, specifically that feathers weren't initially for flight but likely for insulation and display.  It also talks about the discovery of feathers on dinosaurs that aren't necessarily related to flying dinosaurs.  This entire discussion revolves around the *evolution* of feathers and their different purposes over time.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Langi ya nsala ya nyama (Feathered skin of animals):** While the text mentions feathers, it doesn't focus on the simple presence of feathers as the key issue. The *evolution* of feathers is the core concept.
*   **B: Bososoli été nsala ezalaki kosalelama te na kopumbwa (Feathers and animals are not used for hunting):**  The text *does* mention that feathers weren't primarily for hunting, but that's just one aspect of the evolution of feathers.  The broader evolution is the central topic.
*   **D: Bondimami été Confirmation que badinosaure mingi bazalaki na nsala (Discovery and Confirmation that many dinosaurs had feathers):** This is a true statement mentioned in the text, but not the *reason* why something isn't a ""buma ya bokutani ya nsala"" (a point of convergence/meeting point of feathers). The text is about the *evolution* and function of those feathers.



Therefore, the *evolution of feathers* is the overarching concept that the text uses to explain why certain aspects of dinosaur anatomy and feather presence don't fit neatly into preconceived notions.



"
Nsala ya dinosaure ezalaki na nini te?,"The correct answer is **A: Barbules**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Makambo bamoni esalisi mpe na koyeba ndenge mansala ya bandeke ekola. Mpo mapapu ya badinosaures ezalaka na nzete ya makasi te, oyo babengaka mokuwa, kasi eza na biloko mosusu ya mapapu - nsala mpe **bansala ya mike**"".

""Bansala ya mike"" translates to ""barbules"" in English. Barbules are tiny, hair-like structures that help with grip and are found on dinosaur feathers, similar to those on bird feathers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nkisi** - Nkisi refers to a type of African spiritual object; it's not related to dinosaur feathers.
* **C: Nsala ya mikolo** - ""Nsala ya mikolo"" translates to ""daily scale"" or ""scale of the day""; it doesn't describe dinosaur feathers.
* **D: Mopanzi ya nse ya langi ya motane** - This translates to ""tail of a bird of the air""; while dinosaurs had tails, the text specifically points to the *feathers* having barbules.

"Na ba affirmations oyo elandi mpo na ZMapp, oyo wapi ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **B: Ezali na makoki ya kosalisa ba infections oyo ezali kasi kopekisa liwa te**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Na ntango ya komeka PALM, ZMapp esalisaki na kolandela, elimboli ete bato ya sinasi basalelaki yango lokola modele pe bakokanisaki bikisi misato mosusu."" This implies ZMapp *could* save lives but wasn't as effective as initially hoped.
* **Option B directly reflects this:** It highlights ZMapp's ability to treat infections but emphasizes its limited effectiveness in stopping the disease.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Esalemi na ba anticorps:** The text doesn't specify ZMapp's mechanism of action as antibodies.
    * **C: Esalaki lokola kolanda kosamba ya PALM:** This is incorrect. ZMapp is a treatment, not a component of the PALM trial.
    * **D: Bolukiluki emonisi ete matomba na yango ezali moke koleka oyo bakanisaki na ebandeli:** The text states the *effectiveness* was lower than expected, not that the compound itself was more potent.



Therefore, option B is the only one accurately supported by the text."
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki bomekoli ya PALM?","The correct answer is **B: Bakokanisaki nkisi moko ya témoin na ba traitements misato mosusu, moko na yango ezalaki ZMapp**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Na ntango ya komeka PALM, ZMapp esalisaki na kolandela, elimboli ete bato ya sinasi basalelaki yango lokola modele pe bakokanisaki bikisi misato mosusu."" This directly translates to ""In order to test PALM, ZMapp was tested, implying that those who were sick were used as models and were given two treatments, one of which was ZMapp.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bolukiluki yango emonisaki ete ekoki kozala na matomba mingi koleka ndenge bakanisaki liboso:**  This refers to the *results* of ZMapp's effectiveness, not the design of the PALM trial itself.
* **C: ZMapp esalelamaki lokola base ya trial’s:** While ZMapp *was* tested, the passage doesn't say it was the *base* of all trials. It specifically mentions the PALM trial.
* **D: Emonanaki ete ezali malamu mpo na kosalisa maladi oyo ezalaki:** The passage discusses ZMapp's effectiveness, but doesn't state that it's a *cure* for the disease. It only mentions its potential impact in the trial.



"
Balukiluki bakanisi ete wapi puce ya sika ekozala na ntina mingi?,"The correct answer is **B: Bikolo oyo ezali na bozwi mingi (In older people)**.

The passage states: ""...ekoki kosalisa na kosilisa kansere, tuberculose, SIDA pe malaria na bato ya maladi na mikili ya bobola esika motango ya bato oyo babikaka na maladi neti kansere ya mabele ekoki kozala katikati ya bato oyo babikaka na mikili ya bozwi."" 

This translates to ""...it can treat cancer, tuberculosis, AIDS, and malaria in people with age-related illnesses, even among people who are suffering from illnesses such as cancer in older people."" 

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the technology is particularly effective in older people.
"
Nzela nini ekosalelama mpo na kotonga esaleli ya koyeba malali?,"The correct answer is **B: Masini ya kobeta mikanda oyo endimami inkjet**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""mwa eloko moko oyo bakoki kosala na lisalisi ya ba imprimantes à jet ya encre po ezala na talo ya cent moko ya Etats-Unis.""  This translates to ""one thing they can do with an inkjet printer for the price of a dollar in the United States."" The entire premise of the research is centered around using inkjet printers for this purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Centime moko U.S. mpo na moko (One cent U.S. for one):** This refers to the cost, not the tool itself.
* **C: Bapuce oyo ekoki kobeta mikanda (Chips that can print):** The passage mentions printers, not chips.
* **D: Bisaleli mosusu ya koluka maladi (Other disease detection methods):** The passage specifically highlights the new method using printers, not other methods.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, maloba nini oyo elobeli biteni ya libende ya lobate ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **A: Mbala mosusu makambo oyo ekelaki bango esalemaki kala mingi te (Most of the things that happen in it used to happen a long time ago.)**

Here's why:

* The question asks what the observations point to regarding the idea that the Earth's crust is *not* constantly being created.
* The passage states that scientists see ""mountains being worn down"" and ""the Earth not being created much.""
* The passage explicitly says that ""things that are being created now have been happening for a long time."" This directly contradicts the idea that the Earth's crust is *constantly* being created.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kozala na bango elakisi ete sanza ezangi mosala ya mabele te (Being in them indicates that the Earth's crust is not a biological process.)** While the passage mentions that the crust is not a biological process, it doesn't directly connect the observations about wear and tear to this conclusion.
* **C: Ekoki kozala mbuma ya kokita ya sanza (It could be a byproduct of the Earth's crust.)**  The passage is arguing against this idea, not suggesting it's a possibility.
* **D: Ezalaki na yango mingi te oyo ezwamaki na likoló ya sanza (There is a lot of it that is formed in the Earth's crust.)** This is unrelated to the main point of the question, which is about whether the crust is being created *now*.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and directly supported by the text."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, liteya nini na ntina na lolenge ya mabelé emonisi ete ezali na mosala ya géologie oyo ezali kosalema na sanza?","The correct answer is **D: Ndenge yam abele esalamaki kala mingi te** (The way the microbes have evolved is very old).

Here's why:

The passage states that the microbes are ""making chaos"" and that the rocks show signs of long-term, gradual change.  The core argument is that the *evolutionary history of the microbes* suggests a very long timescale for the geological processes involved in forming the rocks. Option D directly reflects this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sanza ezali kokita mokemoke (Rocks are forming slowly):** While the passage says the changes are gradual, this option doesn't link it to the microbes' evolution.  The core argument isn't *just* about slow formation; it's about the *long timescale* required, suggested by the microbes' evolutionary history.
* **B: Ndenge ya mabele esalemaki kala mingi te (Microbes have evolved a long time ago):** This is *almost* right, but the passage emphasizes the evolutionary *history* as a key piece of evidence for the timescale of the geological changes. Option D is more precise.
* **C: Ezali kaka na mwa ndambo moke ya biloko oyo ezali na likoló ya sanza (It's only due to a specific type of material found in the rock):** The passage isn't focused on a specific material. It's about the overall evidence of long-term geological processes and the timeframe suggested by microbial evolution.



Therefore, **D** is the best fit because it directly connects the observation of long-term change in the rocks to the evolutionary timeline of the microbes.  The fact that the microbes have been evolving for a very long time implies that the geological processes taking place in the rocks also require a significant amount of time.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekozala mingi te ya kino na bofundami?","The correct answer is **A: Ba commentaires mosusu (Many comments)**.

The passage emphasizes that while many people might be willing to help with the baptism, the *majority of negative comments* can be very upsetting for the child and their parents, especially when photos are widely shared. The quote from Pamela Ferguson highlights the potential for negative reactions to photos.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mikanda oyo ebimisaka ba foto (Photo editing software):**  The passage doesn't mention photo editing software.
* **C: Masolo ya bilembeteli ya ba témoins miso (Witness testimony details):** The passage focuses on negative reactions and comments, not witness testimonies.
* **D: Mikanda ya masolo (Legal documents):** The passage doesn't discuss legal documents.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali mokakatano ya lelo te mpo na batu oyo batyaka bilembo?","The correct answer is **C: Monene ya glace (Size of the ice cream)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mingi mpe monene ya glace wana, na maloba ya Pittman, eza ya mabe mpenza mpona bato ya masuwa na mibu 15 oyo euti koleka.""  This directly translates to: ""And the **size** of this ice cream, according to Pittman, is very bad for the 15 people who are there.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndenge ya mopepe ya makasi (Strong wind):** While strong winds might contribute to the ice cream melting faster, the passage focuses on the *size* as the primary concern.
* **B: Motango ya glace (Type of ice cream):** The passage doesn't mention the type of ice cream, only its size.
* **D: Glace oyo ezali konyangwa (Ice cream that is melting):**  The passage implies melting is a *result* of the size, but not the core issue.  The core issue is the large size *causing* problems.



"
"Longola glace, nini mosusu ezali kotungisa milende ya kobikisa bato?","The correct answer is **B: Ezalela ya météo (Weather conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""makambo mabe ya mopepe ebebisi makasi mosala ya kobikisa bato"" which translates to ""bad weather greatly hinders the work of rescue."" Therefore, the weather is the primary reason for the difficulty in rescue efforts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kozanga biloko ya kopesa (Lack of equipment):** The passage doesn't mention a lack of equipment as a contributing factor.
*   **C: Kozanga lisalisi (Lack of resources):** Similar to A, the passage doesn't specify resource scarcity.
*   **D: Bato oyo bakangamaka (Injured people):** While the injured people are the ones needing rescue, the passage focuses on *why* the rescue is difficult, and the weather is the key impediment.



"
bindimeli nini Roberts aboyaki kondimisa yango?,"The correct answer is **A: Ethicalité ya kolobela makambo (Ethicality of abortion)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Roberts said it was ""not ethical"" to always impose the same things on everyone regarding abortion. This directly addresses the ethical considerations surrounding abortion.
* While the text mentions Roe v. Wade and its legal implications, the core of Roberts' statement is about the ethical principle of not imposing a single standard on everyone.
* Option B is partially true (the court's legitimacy is at stake), but not the central point of his statement.
* Option C (the time of life when life begins) is a related but secondary issue to the ethical argument.
* Option D (the ability of an individual to have a child) is also related but not the primary focus of what Roberts addressed.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A: Ethicalité ya kolobela makambo**."
Likambo nini Roberts amonaki ete ezalaki na bizaleli malamu te mpo na kolobela yango?,"The correct answer is **B: Mokano ya Roe v. Wade**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kasi, azongelaki makambo alobaki liboso ete Roe v. Wade ezalaki """"mobeko batia na ekolo"""" pe amonisi ntina ya bikateli malamu ya esambiselo monene."" This directly points to Roe v. Wade being the issue Roberts considers to be a dangerous precedent.
"
Banzete mibale ya pole ezali kongenga wapi?,"The correct answer is **A: Epai ya likolo (At the airport)**.

The text states: ""...Batie banzete mibale ya pole mpo etalaka na likolo na butu."" which translates to ""...They gathered the elderly people to take them to the airport.""
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini bandako milai ya sika ezali kotongama na esika yango?","The correct answer is **A: Na katikati ya mokolo (At noon)**.

Here's why:

The text states the initial situation is at 8:46 AM. The goal is to have five rows of tents set up. The location chosen is ""na esika wana, esika ya kozwa transport mpe parke ya ekaniseli ekozala na katikati"" - a location convenient for transport and with a parking area in the middle. This implies the tents will be set up in the *middle* of the day, which is generally around noon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: na 8:46 liboso ya zanga (At 8:46 AM):** This is the starting time, not when the tents will be set up.
* **C: Butu mobimba (Very late):** While it might take some time, the setup isn't described as happening very late.
* **D: Botongi yango ezali kokoba (The sun is setting):** This is irrelevant to the setup time and the text doesn't mention the sun setting.



"
Makambo nini emonisi ete Bandeko Sambo bazali mabulu?,"The correct answer is **D: Bililingi ya mabulu na Mabelé (Infrared differences in the rocks)**.

The passage states: ""Bilili ya infrarouges ezomonisa bambongwana ya temperature na kati ya butu pe moi, emonisi ete mbala mosusu eza libulu. Ezalaki malili koleka bisika ya zingazinga na moi pe moto na butu. Bizaleli na yango ya thermique eza te malamu neti ya mabulu minene ya Mabele oyo mbala mingi ezalaka na molunge ya ndenge moko, kasi ezoyokana na kozala na mabulu ya miali na se ya mabele,"" which translates to: ""Infrared radiation reveals differences in temperature between the rocks and the air, showing that it is often significant. It is much greater than in areas of vegetation and people. The thermal characteristics are not similar to large volcanic rocks which are often in a single layer, but are associated with layered rocks.""

Therefore, the infrared differences in the rocks (layered rocks) are what indicate the Bandeko Sambo are layered.
"
Ndenge nini bizaleli ya molunge ya Bandeko basi Sambo emonanaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Bililingi ya infrarouge (Infrared wavelengths)**.

The passage states: ""Bilili ya infrarouges ezomonisa bambongwana ya temperature na kati ya butu pe moi, emonisi ete mbala mosusu eza libulu."" This translates to: ""Infrared wavelengths detect the difference in temperature between the ground and the air, showing that it is often large.""

Therefore, the phenomenon of the Banded Clouds being observed is due to **infrared wavelengths**.
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, maloba nini nan tina na motu bazokanisa ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **B: Balobaki ete abwakaki explosif moko** (They said he had detonated a single explosive).

Here's why:

The passage states that when the people discovered the bomb, they accused him of detonating it.  The fact that the accusation *specifically* mentions an ""explosif moko"" (a single explosive) is the key.  This is a common tactic to quickly label someone as a perpetrator, even without concrete evidence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Asalelaki motuka moko na ntango ya kobundisa ye** (He detonated a single explosive) - This is the same as option B, just phrased differently.
*   **C: Ekolo na ye eyebani na bakonzi** (His background is known to the authorities) - While his Uighur ethnicity is mentioned, the core issue isn't his background *being known*; it's the accusation of detonating the bomb.
*   **D: Azokaki te** (He couldn't) - This is directly contradicted by the passage, which states the people *accused* him of detonating a bomb.



Therefore, the answer is **B**."
Nsango nini etali kobunda bakonzi bandimisi?,"The correct answer is **D: Nkombo ya liboso mpe ya nsuka ya moto oyo bafundaki (The endless and desperate suffering of the person who is imprisoned).**

Here's why:

* The text describes a horrific situation where a person is imprisoned and subjected to torture by others. 
* The question asks what motivates the prison guards. The text implies they are motivated by the **suffering** and **desperation** of the person they are torturing. They are not acting out of a noble reason, but from a cruel intent. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nsango na ntina na basangani nionso (The responsibility of all those involved):** While many people might be complicit in such a system, the text focuses on the direct motivation of the prison guards.
* **B: Ekolo ya motu bazokanisa (The environment of the imprisoned person):** The environment is a *result* of the guards' actions, not their motivation.
* **C: Ntina oyo ezali nsima ya kobunda (The reason that is above all else):** This is too vague. The text doesn't give a grand reason, but points to a more primal and disturbing motivation.



Therefore, option D best reflects the implied motivation of the prison guards based on the text. They are driven by the torment they inflict and the suffering it causes."
Ekipe nini ekobeta na match na Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Afrique ya Sud mpe Australie**.

The text states: ""Match ya suka ya eleko wana ekobetama na Ellis Park na Johannesburg na poso ezoya, ntango Springboks ekobeta na Australie."" which translates to ""The deciding match will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg at a later date, as Springboks will play against Australia.""
"
Springboks ekobeta lisano na bango ya nsima wapi?,"The correct answer is **A: Australie**.

The text states: ""Match ya suka ya eleko wana ekobetama na Ellis Park na Johannesburg na poso ezoya, ntango Springboks ekobeta na Australie."" which translates to ""The rematch will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, where Springboks will play against Australia.""
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esika nini ezwaki mokakatano na yango na boumeli ya mosala?","The correct answer is **B: Kobatela gyroscope**.

Here's why:

The text states the issue is with the **gyroscope** in the station's mechanism. The question asks where the malfunction is. Therefore, the malfunction is specifically related to the gyroscope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobatela bosika oyo ekoki na masini ya kopusa (Fixable location on the machine):** This is too general. The text points to a specific component.
* **C: Kotia Jet na mosala (Launching a jet in the station):** The text mentions Russian jets and their involvement in the situation, but it's not the malfunction itself.
* **D: Kozongela ezaleli ya malamu (Freezing a small part):** The text doesn't indicate freezing as the cause of the problem.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, mokano ya saba ya esika ya mosala ezalaki nini?","The correct answer is **B: Kopusana penepene na bamasini ya kopusa ya kobongwana (Resisting the powerful engines of propulsion)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Station ebatelaki makanisi na ye, atako babungisaki gyroscope moko na ebandeli na mosala moko ya kokende likolo, kino na suka ya kobima na likolo."" (The station had its own engines, and they installed a gyroscope on it to help it move and stabilize.)
* **The passage further states:** ""Chiao na Sharipov balobaki baza mosika mpenza na biloko bazosalela mpona kobongisa mopepe."" (Chiao and Sharipov said they were having serious problems with things they were trying to fix.)
* **The context implies:** The gyroscope was installed to help with movement, but it's causing problems.  This suggests it's fighting against the powerful forces of the engines trying to propel the station.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kozwa gyroscope oyo ebungaki (Causing the gyroscope that was stabilizing it):** The problem *is* related to the gyroscope, but the passage indicates it's not functioning correctly and causing a problem, not causing the stabilization.
* **C: Kosilisa esika ya kotambola (Stabilizing the flight path):**  The gyroscope was meant to stabilize the flight path, but the passage states it's leading to problems.
* **D: Kotia bajet na mosala (To drive the cosmonauts crazy):** While the situation is stressful, the primary issue seems to be technical, not simply annoying the cosmonauts.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, , oyo wapi ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **C: Mibeko oyo etali email ya spam esalelamaki na likambo yango.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what's happening that's not on the surface.** The passage states AOL was known for sending unsolicited emails (spam) in 2003 to generate electronic traffic.  The question implies there's a deeper, less obvious consequence.
* **Option C directly addresses that deeper consequence:** The spam emails were being sent *through* AOL's systems. This means AOL was facilitating the spread of unwanted emails.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Efundamaki na ekolo esika wapi AOL ezali na biro munene (It happened at the place where AOL has a large office):** While AOL had offices, this is a very superficial answer. It doesn't explain the *process* of how the spam was sent.
    * **B: Etumbu emekamaki (The spam was very abundant):**  While the passage mentions spam, this doesn't explain *what* was happening that was hidden.
    * **D: Bazalaki kofunda AOL (They were building AOL):** The passage refers to a specific practice (sending spam), not general company building.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and insightful answer to the question of what's happening that's not immediately obvious from the text."
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobeli likambo yango na bosikisiki?","The correct answer is **A: AOL afundamaki mpo na kokabola biloko oyo basɛngaki te** (AOL was founded to send unwanted messages).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that AOL was founded to ""pesi moto etumbu na kosalelaka mobeko oyo babimisaki na 2003 mpona kokanga nzela na mikanda ya electronique mingi, oyo babengaka mpe spam, mpo batindela bato yango te kozanga bato wana basenga.""  This translates to ""to allow people to send messages they were creating in 2003 to create a network of electronic devices, which they also called spam, to prevent people from not being bothered by those people."" Essentially, it started as a platform for sending mass, unsolicited messages (spam).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Likambo yango etali ba fournisseurs mibale ya liboso ya mosala ya internet** (Its purpose was to be a general internet service provider) - While AOL *became* an ISP, the text focuses on its *initial* purpose which was spam and mass messaging.
* **C: Likambo yango etalemaki na 2003** (Its purpose was in 2003) - While the text mentions 2003, it doesn't describe its *purpose* as being specific to that year.  It describes a long-term function.
* **D: AOL nde ebandaki kofunda likambo yango** (AOL was the one who founded it) - While the text states AOL founded it, the question asks *what* the purpose of that founding was.

Therefore, option A best reflects the information given in the text about AOL's initial motivation.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, club nini Vidal abandaki kobeta mpo bitelo misato eleki?","The correct answer is **A: Seville**.

The text states: ""Vidal oyo azalaki na mibu 28 ayaki na Barça mibu misato eleki, autaki na Seville."" This translates to: ""Vidal, who is 28 years old and has been at Barça for 5 years, went to Seville.""
"
Vidal asali masano boni na Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The question asks how many matches Vidal played for Barça. The text states: ""Vidal abeta match 49 mpona ekipe wana."" which translates to ""Vidal played 49 matches for that team (Barça).""
"
Ekipe nini ebetaki na bango na masano wana?,"The correct answer is **A: Jarque**.

The text states ""Liboso saison ebanda, Jarque asalaka kosala..."". This means Jarque is the one who is doing the activity described. The rest of the text details *where* Jarque is staying and *when* he is doing it, but the question asks *who* is doing the action.
"
Mpo na nini Jarque azalaki kofanda na otele yango?,"The correct answer is **A: Azalaki na momeseno** (He is in training).

The passage states he's training in Coverciano, Italy and staying at the team hotel before the match in Bologna. This implies he's preparing for the game, which means he's in training.  The other options don't fit the context:

* **B: Azalaki na likita ya liboso ya eleko** (He is in the midst of the week's schedule) - While likely true, it doesn't directly explain *why* he's at the training camp.
* **C: Azalaki na match moko dimanche** (He has a match on Sunday) - This is stated, but it doesn't explain his current location.
* **D: Azalaki kosala momeseno na Bolonia** (He is training in Bologna) - He's training *before* the match in Bologna, not *in* Bologna.
"
Mpo na nini biro ya géophysique ya Jakarta ekopesa likebisi te?,"The correct answer is **A: Likama ya tsunami ezalaki te (There was no tsunami threat)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Likebisi moko te ya tsunami epesamaki... Ata ezalaki te na motungisi ya tsunami..."" which translates to ""There was no tsunami... There was not even a tsunami warning...""

Therefore, the reason the Jakarta geophysical bureau didn't issue an alert is because there was no tsunami threat.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki,  koningana ya mabele yango esalaki nini?","The correct answer is **C: Likebisi oyo ebimisami** (Volcanic eruptions).

Here's why:

The question asks about what causes the earthquake. The passage states: ""Likebisi moko te ya tsunami epesamaki, mpe na kolanda maloba ya lisanga ya Jakarta oyo elandelaka makambo ya ba volcan..."" which translates to ""Not even a tsunami was caused, and in Indonesia the monitoring agency of Jakarta which monitors volcanic activity..."" This clearly links the earthquake to volcanic eruptions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bato ya mboka oyo babangaki** (Local people who speak): This is irrelevant to the cause of the earthquake.
* **B: Likama ya tsunami** (Tsunami source): The passage states there *wasn't* a tsunami, so this is incorrect.
* **D: 6,5 na échelle ya bonene** (6.5 on the Richter scale): The passage mentions the magnitude was 6.5, but doesn't say it *caused* the earthquake. It's just a measurement of it.
"
"Na kati ya minzoto yango, oyo wapi etindaka moi mpe minzoto mosusu nyonso esalaka mosala?","The correct answer is **D: Kongenga, motango ya Rossby, mpe kobalukabaluka**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that Bamonaki ete Sanza studies the *entire* phenomenon of celestial mechanics, specifically focusing on the interaction with plasma. It also highlights the importance of Rossby waves and turbulence in this process.  The core of the described research lies in the interplay of these three elements.

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kongenga mpe koleka ya plasma** - While plasma is involved, it doesn't capture the full scope of the research.
* **B: Motango ya Rossy, kobalukabaluka, mpe kozonga ya ema** - ""Kozonga ya ema"" (something like ""emission of rays"") isn't directly mentioned in the text.
* **C: Kobalukabaluka mpe kongenga** - This misses the crucial role of Rossby waves.



Therefore, **D** best reflects the complete picture of what Bamonaki ete Sanza studies according to the passage.



"
Ndenge nini bayebaka motángo ya Rossby ya monzoto moko?,"The correct answer is **A: Kongenga mpe kobalukabaluka (Oscillation and turbulence)**.

The text states: ""Pole pe kobaluka, basalelaka yango elongo mpona koyeba motango ya minzoto Rossby, oyo eza na boyokani na plazma.""  This translates to ""Through oscillation and turbulence, they create a window to understand the Rossby wave frequency, which is related to plasma.""

Therefore, the process of **oscillation and turbulence** is how they study the Rossby wave frequency.
"
Bato boni na mokama oyo batunaki bango bazali kopesa maboko na Australie ekóma mbala moko république?,"The correct answer is **A: 31 %**.

The passage states: ""pe bato 31 na kati ya mokama bakanisi ete Australie esengeli ata moke te kokoma repiblike."" which translates to ""and 31% of those surveyed said Australia should not even consider becoming a republic.""
"
"Kolandana na Julie Gillard, ntango nini Australie esengeli kokoma république?","The correct answer is **B: Nsima ya boyangeli ya Mokonzi-mwasi Elizabeth II**.

The text states that Julia Gillard argued for a republic *eventually*, after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. This is directly mentioned in the text: ""...alobaki na ntango ya kampanie ya maponi ya 2010 azalaki kokanisa ete Australie esengeli kokoma république na suka ya boyangeli ya mokonzi Elizabeth II.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Noki mpenza:** While the text acknowledges republican sentiment, it doesn't state it's ""possible"" in general.
* **C: Ata moke te:** The text explicitly states Gillard was advocating for a republic.
* **D: Nsima ya maponami ya fédéral:**  The text mentions the 2010 referendums, but it's not saying a republic is tied to federalism. The connection is to the Queen's reign.
"
Ebongiseli nini ezali na bolukiluki ya mibeko?,"The correct answer is **D: Komite ya moke ya bokengeli mpe ya bolukiluki**.

Here's why:

The question asks what organization Leslie Komen's foundation is connected to regarding the restriction of funds for abortion services. The text explicitly states that Cliff Stearns, who is investigating this, is looking into the influence of the ""Komite ya moke ya bokengeli mpe ya bolukiluki"" (a specific committee within the House of Representatives) which is linked to Planned Parenthood and has influence on funding decisions related to abortion.
"
Cliff Stearns azali mokambi ya komite nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Komite ya moke ya bokengeli mpe ya bolukiluki**.

The text states: ""...epesaka rapore na yango oyo bazosala na mimonisi Cliff Stearns, oyo azoluka koyeba soki basalelaka bampako mpona kopekisa mbongo ya kosopa zemi na nzela ya ebongiseli Planned Parenthood oyo eza na mokumba ya molandi ya president na komite moke ya kokengela pe kolandela, oyo eza na se ya komite ya nguya pe ya mbongo ya Chambre.""

This translates to: ""...reports to his advisor Cliff Stearns, who seeks to find out if they are using funds to support me through an advisor of Planned Parenthood which is headed by the president of a special committee to investigate and oversee, which is in the House of Representatives and the Appropriations Committee.""

Therefore, Cliff Stearns is on a special committee to investigate and oversee, which is the **Komite ya moke ya bokengeli mpe ya bolukiluki** (Special Committee on Oversight and Investigations).

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekomelaki mwasi yango ya Suisse te?","The correct answer is **C: Basangisaki ye nzoto na makasi na bato 5**.

The text states: ""Tokangi bato mitano oyo basangisaki nzoto na makasi na mwana-mwasi ya Swisse..."" which translates to ""We have identified five people who have been communicating extensively with the Swiss child..."" This directly implies the Swiss child was in contact with these five people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazwaki biloko na ye oyo bayibaki:** While the police investigated the Swiss child, the text doesn't specifically say they *learned* things *about* her. It says they identified people communicating *with* her.
* **B: Babomaki ye:** The text doesn't mention the police seeing the Swiss child.
* **D: Bayibaki telefone na ye mpe ordinatɛrɛ na ye ya moke:** The text mentions the police know about her phone and computer, but not specifically that they are communicating *with* her on them. They know *about* the devices.



"
Société nini ezwaki mbano ya Taïwan Sustainable Award na 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""...Yuan mokonzi ya ekolo Chine apesi ASUS libonza na mbano ya Taiwan Sustainable Award ya 2007."" (The Chinese government awarded ASUS the Taiwan Sustainable Award in 2007.)
"
PC ASUS Eee ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ordinatere** (Computer).

The text states ""ASUS Eee PC... ekomaki likambo bato bazolobela mingi na 2007 na Taipei IT Month"" which translates to ""ASUS Eee PC... was very talked about in 2007 at Taipei IT Month"". The context implies it's a computing device.  The description further mentions it's a ""ordinatere ya maboko"" (handheld computer). While small and portable, it's still a computer.  ""Mobombami"" (mobile device) is too general. The context doesn't suggest it's a smartphone or tablet specifically.
"
Nani azalaki na mokumba ya mikanda ya poste oyo ebungaki ?,"The correct answer is **C: Mwana mobali moko** (A young child).

The text states: ""Mwana-mobali abombaki mikanda ya poste koleka 600..."" which translates to ""A young child wrote/sent over 600 postcards..."" The problem stems from the child's actions causing the postal issues.
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nani abimisaki mokanda ya kosenga bolimbisi mpo na mikanda oyo ebungaki?","The correct answer is **A: Bavandi ya mboka (Local residents)**.

The text states that local residents complained to the Obanazawa post office about not receiving mail. This complaint led to the post office investigating and finding the missing mail.
"
Tango nini Del Potro asengelaki kotalela likambo na ye ya lipeka?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntango ya eteni ya mibale (At the end of the set)**.

The passage states: ""...Basalisaki Potro na lipeka banda na ngonga wana kasi azongelaki match na ye."" which translates to ""...They gave Potro a break, but he still lost the match.""  This implies the break happened at the end of the set, and he couldn't capitalize on it to win the set (and therefore the match).
"
Oyo euti na kopema ya liboso liboso ezalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Elongamaki na Del Potro na eteni ya mibale**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Del Potro was consistently close to winning sets, reaching 6-6 in many.
* It also mentions he lost the match despite being close.
* This indicates that Del Potro's struggles were in *tie-break situations* (eteni ya mibale). He couldn't close out those crucial points to win the sets.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A:** While Murray won the match, the question is specifically about Del Potro's performance.
* **B:** The text focuses on Del Potro's difficulty converting close sets into wins, not his overall strategy.
* **C:**  While Murray won sets, the core issue described is Del Potro's problems *in tie-breaks*.



"
"Ndenge elobami na bokomi, nani, mpenza mpenza, akutanaki na mobɛli moko?","The correct answer is **A: Guvernere**.

The text states: ""Lelo, toyebi ete bana-kelasi mosusu ya biteyelo ya bana bakutanaki na moto moko ya maladi."" This translates to ""Today, we know that more and more students in different grades are coming into contact with one sick person."" The governor is the one making this statement. While it affects students, the governor is the one speaking about the situation.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki,  endimiseli nini gouverneur apesaki te ntango azalaki koloba na bana mboka ya Texas?","The correct answer is **A: Ebongiseli yango ezali kosala malamu**.

Here's why:

The governor says, ""Likambo oyo eza ya monene. Ndima ete ebongiseli na biso ezosala malamu ndenge esengeli."" This translates to ""This is a big issue. The reason we are giving a demonstration is to show the right way.""  He's emphasizing the importance of doing things correctly and thoughtfully in the demonstration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Makambo mazali kosalema mpo na kobatela bokengi ya bato banso** (Things are escalating to protect the safety of many people): While safety is a concern, the governor's statement doesn't focus on escalating problems or safety. It focuses on *how* the demonstration should be conducted.
* **C: Bazali na bisaleli mpo na kolonga mokakatano yango** (They are in conflict to fight against it): The passage doesn't indicate conflict. The governor is discussing a demonstration, not a fight.
* **D: Likambo yango ezali monene te** (It's not a big issue): The governor explicitly states the opposite: ""Likambo oyo eza ya monene"" (This is a big issue).



"
Esika nini ya parodie ya nsango esalemaki na bayekoli bale ya kala ya UW?,"The correct answer is **B: Kelasi ya maponami (Freshman class)**.

The text states: ""Heck na Johnson bazalaki na likanisi ya kobimisa buku moko oyo ekolobelaka basango - mpe kosala bareportage - ntango bazalaki bana-kelasi na UW na 1988.""  This translates to ""Heck and Johnson were in the same freshman class that published a book..."" indicating the parody started during their freshman year at UW.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Raport ya Colbert (Colbert Report)**: The Colbert Report was a later show, not the origin of the parody.
* **C: Emission ya mokolo na mokolo (Daily show)**: Similar to the Colbert Report, the Daily Show was a later show.
* **D: Litungulu (Thesis)**: A thesis is a longer academic work, not the starting point of a parody.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini na oyo elandi ezali te na kati ya bokonzi ya ","The correct answer is **C: Site internet**.

The text explicitly states: ""Onion ekomi bokonzi monene ya kopesa basango, eza na mashine ya koniata mikanda, **site internet** oyo ebendaki bapaya 5 000 000 na sanza ya zomi...""  This directly identifies the Onion's core platform as a website.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezalaki kokɛngɛla na polisi?","The correct answer is **C: Esika ya kokota na balabala Downing**.

The text clearly states that the initial gathering of protestors was at the site of the Downing Street protest, where the Prime Minister resides. The police were responding to this initial protest. While the protestors moved to other locations, the initial focus of the police response was the Downing Street area.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Trafalgar Square:**  While the protestors *did* move to Trafalgar Square, the initial police action was at Downing Street.
* **B: Forum ya Printemps:** This is a location where the Conservative party was holding a spring event. The protestors *ended up* there, but it wasn't the reason for the police response.
* **D: Hoteli Grand Connaught Rooms:**  Similar to the forum, this is where the protestors *ended up*, not where the police were initially responding.



"
Na ngonga nini bapolisi basengaki na bato oyo bazalaki kosala mobulu ete bakende kofanda esika mosusu mpo mituka ekoma mingi lisusu te?,"The correct answer is **D: Na 11:20**.

The text states: ""Na 11:20, polisi esengaki batomboki bazonga na nzela, eyebisaki bango ete ata baza na lotomo ya kotomboka basengeli kokanga bato nzela ya kotambola te."" (At 11:20, the police told the protesters to leave the road, warning them that even if they weren't planning to storm Downing Street, they should not be encouraging others to do so.)
"
Nini ezali solo mpo na bolukiluki oyo monganga Ehud Ur asalaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba mpuku mosusu oyo bazalaki na diabɛti liboso bazali lisusu na diabete te** (Many people who have diabetes also don't have diabetes).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Neti bato mosusu ya mayele, azondima te soki bakoki kobikisa diabte, alobi ete makambo wana oyo bamoni eza na ntina te mpona bato oyo basi bazwa diabte ya Lolenge 1."" (However, many adults, even if they can't be cured of diabetes, he says the things seen are not for those who have Type 1 diabetes.) This implies that the observed symptoms in adults with Type 2 diabetes might not be the same as those in Type 1 diabetes.
* **Option B directly reflects this:** It says that many people with diabetes don't actually have diabetes in the way Type 1 diabetes is understood.  This is essentially what Dr. Ur is explaining – there's a difference between the presentation of diabetes in different types.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba résultats ekoki kozala na litomba mpo na ba malades oyo bazalaki na diabète Type 1 oyo bazalaki liboso** (The results can be misleading for patients who have Type 1 diabetes who are also frequently ill).  While illness can complicate things, the passage doesn't focus on misleading results for Type 1 patients.
* **C: Azali na elikya ete makambo oyo bamoni ekoki komema na nkisi** (He believes the things seen can be caused by a virus). Dr. Ur doesn't say the symptoms are viral. He's pointing out the differences in how diabetes presents.
* **D: Ba soso mosusu oyo bazali na diabɛti te bazali sikoyo na diabeti** (Most people who have diabetes are not the same with diabetes). This is grammatically awkward and doesn't capture the nuance of Dr. Ur's statement.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, monganga Ur azali na ntembe mpo na nini?","The correct answer is **A: Soki makambo oyo bamoni ezali na ntina mpo na bato oyo bazali na diabète ya Type 1**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Dr. Ur is correcting the misconception that the observed effects (weight loss, etc.) are due to a lack of insulin. He clarifies that these effects are *not* the same for people with Type 1 diabetes.
* The question asks what Dr. Ur is trying to correct. His statement directly addresses and corrects the incorrect understanding of the effects of diabetes in Type 1 patients.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Soki nkisi ekoki kosalema:**  While managing diabetes involves insulin and potentially other interventions, the passage doesn't focus on whether insulin can be ""fixed.""
* **C: Makanisi ya bato mosusu ya mayele na oyo etali nkisi moko:** The passage does not discuss the treatment or management of diabetes beyond the insulin aspect.
* **D: Soki ba mpuku oyo bazali na diabète te bakotikala bongo:** The passage doesn't state that the people with diabetes aren't experiencing something. It states that what they are experiencing isn't the same reason for people with Type 1.

"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola malamu te likama ya Vol CG4684?","The correct answer is **A: Na ebandeli mpepo yango ekokaki te kokita mpo na météo (The plane could not take off due to the weather).**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mopepe mabe oyo esalaki ete mpepo ekwea te yango mpe ezokanga bolukiluki nzela po esalama te."" (Bad weather caused the plane to not take off and it was unsafe to fly.)

This directly indicates that the weather is the reason the plane couldn't take off, and therefore, the reason it was diverted. Options B, C, and D are not explicitly mentioned or supported by the text. While the weather *caused* the problem, the text doesn't state it was a localized issue, happened multiple times, or that the landing site was compromised by the weather.
"
Nini esalaki ete Vol CG4684 elongola kokita na yango?,"The correct answer is **D: Mopepe ezalaki mabe**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Mopepe mabe oyo esalaki ete mpepo ekwea te yango..."". This translates to ""The bad weather that makes the plane not fly..."".
* The reason for the diversion is directly linked to the bad weather preventing safe flight. 
* Option A is incorrect because the passage says the diversion is *because* the area is not safe to fly.
* Option B is incorrect because the passage doesn't mention the plane having excessive wind.
* Option C is incorrect because the passage states the plane was diverted *because* of the weather, not because they were fixing something.



"
"Na kotalela bokomi, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo elobeli likambo oyo Franciszek Kowal akutanaki na yango ezali solo?","The correct answer is **C: Abukaki kiti moko ntango azalaki koluka kobima** (He only wakes up when he is trying to sleep).

Here's why:

The passage states that Franciszek Kowal was disturbed by people trying to climb windows.  He observed that they were using ladders, but the windows didn't open. He heard a single creak, and then they started to climb.  The sentence structure implies the creak happened *during* the window-climbing attempt. Therefore, he only noticed the creak when the climbing was in progress, and he woke up at that specific moment.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alongaki kobuka lininisa moko (He only wakes up when he is trying to sleep):** While the context suggests he was disturbed *while* trying to sleep, this is a broader statement than what the passage directly says. The passage specifically links the awakening to the window-climbing.
* **B: Nsukansuka, azwaki mpasi te (He is not easily awakened):** The passage clearly indicates that he *was* awakened.
* **D: Azokaki ntango azalaki koluka kobuka lininisa (He doesn't wake up when he is trying to sleep):** This is the opposite of what the text implies.



"
Mpo na nini ezali mpasi mpo na koyeba bopusi oyo mopepe makasi Danielle ekoki kobimisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Mopepe yango ezali mosika na kokóma na mabele.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lokola mopepe makasi ezalaki mosika ya kokoma na mabele, eza mpasi na koyeba mabe ekoki kosala na Etats-Unis to na Caraïbes.""  (Because a hurricane is very prone to causing damage, bad consequences can be caused in the United States or the Caribbean.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Balobi ete mopepe yango ekokóma makasi tii ekokóma mopɛpɛ makas** (They say the hurricane is very strong and will become stronger): While true, this doesn't explain *why* it's important to predict the damage.
*   **B: Bato ya science bazali na ntembe te mpo na mipɛpɛ oyo eumelaka mpo na mopɛpɛ makasi** (Scientists are not being cautious about the predictions for this hurricane): The passage indicates scientists *are* being cautious; they are predicting the hurricane's path and strength.
*   **D: Mopepe yango ezali mosika mingi na Miami** (The hurricane is very close to Miami): While the hurricane's location is relevant, the passage doesn't focus on its closeness to Miami as the *reason* for predicting damage; it's the hurricane's inherent destructive power.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo elobeli Mopɛpɛ makasi Danielle ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **A: Impact na yango na Caraïbes eyebani te** (Impacto na yango na Caraïbes eyebani te).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Impacto na yango na Caraïbes eyebani te"" which translates to ""Its impact on the Caribbean is not yet known.""  The text emphasizes the uncertainty regarding the Caribbean impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esalemaki na Mbu Atlantike** (It is located in the Atlantic Ocean): This is true, but it doesn't address *why* it's considered a dangerous storm.
* **C: Ekokaki kobongwana mopepe makasi** (It can become a major hurricane):  The text states it has the *potential* to become a major hurricane, but doesn't state that it is one *currently*.
* **D: Ezali pene na kokita na mabele** (It is far from land): While the text says it's 3,000 miles from Miami, it doesn't explain the *reason* for concern; the potential for impact is what makes it dangerous.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nini balobaka ete esengeli kosalema na bokono liboso ya kobimisa bokono ya mokili mobimba?","The correct answer is **A: Esengeli kokoma oyo ebomaka mingi te** (You should avoid what spreads easily).

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes that while H5N1 is present in Turkey, it hasn't spread to humans.  However, the worry is that *if* a human gets it, they could spread it to others. 
* The focus is on preventing the *spread* of the disease, especially because it could potentially lead to a severe illness.
* Option A directly addresses this concern by advocating avoiding anything that spreads easily. The text implies that because the virus has the potential to spread (even if it hasn't yet), precautions are necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bilembeteli esengeli kotikala moke** (The incubation period should be short) - While a short incubation period would be beneficial, the passage doesn't focus on the incubation period itself.
* **C: Bato mingi basengeli kozwa maladi yango** (Many people should get the disease) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies. The concern is *preventing* people from getting the disease.
* **D: Bana basengeli komona bilembo** (Children should watch for symptoms) - While being aware of symptoms is important, the primary message isn't about children specifically watching for symptoms, but about preventative measures to avoid spreading the disease.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, mopepe makasi ezalaki mosika boni na Fujian?","The correct answer is **D: 77 kilomètres**.

The question states the plane is 77 kilometers *beyond* the Fujian province in China. 
"
Nani apesaki George W. Bush mbote ntango akomaki na Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng mpe Lee Hsien Loong**.

The text states that the Prime Minister of Singapore, Wong Kan Seng, welcomed George W. Bush and that he (Wong Kan Seng) also discussed issues related to terrorism with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Therefore, they are the ones who greeted Bush.
"
Ntango nini président alobelaki na ntina na kotanda nkita na Asia?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntango akomaki na Singapour** (When he arrived in Singapore).

The text states: ""President ya Etats-Unis George W. Bush akomaki na Singapour..."" (President of the United States George W. Bush arrived in Singapore...).  He announced his intention to engage in diplomacy in Asia *upon arriving* in Singapore.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali mokano ya guvɛrnema mobimba?","The correct answer is **C: Zua mituka mosusu 1.300**

Here's why:

The first statement (P) explains that it takes 300 hours to create a dress, but it requires 1300 hours to produce enough dresses for a larger demand. The question asks about the government's involvement.  The government would likely be involved in funding or supporting the increased production to meet the higher demand, which necessitates the extra 1300 hours of work.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Misolo ya mingi mingi na sanza ya misato ya mobu oyo** (Many things in the industry): While the overall industry is involved, the question seeks a *specific* element related to government involvement.
*   **B: Zua mituka 300** (It takes 300 hours): This refers to the time per dress, not the overall cost or government involvement.
*   **D: Kitisa ebele ya batu na mituka** (Employ many people):  While increased production might involve more workers, this doesn't directly relate to the *government's* role. The government might provide incentives or support for employment, but the core issue is the increased production cost.



"
Guvernema esakolaki nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Bazali kokana kopesa mbongo mpo na kosala mituka mosusu 1.300**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states that 300 chariots require 1300 units of resources. This means the government is fundraising to acquire 1300 units of resources.
* **Q (the question)** asks what the government is doing.
* **Option C** directly reflects the information in the passage.  The government is raising funds to obtain 1300 units of resources to power the chariots.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage mentions chariots, but doesn't say the government is *building* them. It's about the resources needed to *power* them.
* **B:** The passage doesn't mention anything about silencing dissent.
* **D:** The passage states that many people *left* on the road, not that a large number of chariots were breaking down.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, makambo nini eyebani?","The correct answer is **A: Nivo ya likama ekitisami (The mattress level is increasing).**

Here's why:

* **The original text says:** ""Aza na mayele moko te oyo emonisi ete bitumba ekozala kala te. Kasi, kokitisa nivo ya likama na makasi elimboli te ete likama nyonso esili."" 
* **Translation:** ""It's with a single mattress that shows that the bed is not old. However, increasing the mattress level greatly indicates that the entire bed is not old.""

This implies that the mattress level *increasing* is a sign that the bed itself is newer and not old. Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Likama ezali lisusu te (The bed is not new):** The text says the *opposite* - that an increasing mattress level indicates the bed is *newer*.
* **C: Bazali kozela ete babundisa bango (They are trying to fix them):** The text doesn't mention anyone trying to fix anything.
* **D: Mayele ya libateli endimi ete kobunda yango ekozala makasi (The mattress level is strangely increasing):** While the increase is noted, the text doesn't frame it as ""strange."" It's presented as a sign.



"
Liloba nini na ntina na kotemela ezali ya solo te?,"The correct answer is **C: Kotemela esengaki kolongwa ya CEP ya liboso**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Na sanza eleki etuluku moko elobaki ete liboso CEP alongwa mosala na kati ya bibongiseli bazwaki mpona komema mboka na maponi ya sika.""  This translates to: ""According to one report, the CEP is always organized with the participation of civil society organizations to seek a solution to the conflict.""

* **The question asks:** ""Liloba nini na ntina na kotemela ezali ya solo te?"" which means ""What is the reason why the strike is not valid?""

* **Option C directly addresses this:** It connects the validity of the strike to the regular organization of the CEP, implying that the strike is invalid because the CEP is typically a forum for finding solutions, and therefore, a strike is unnecessary or improper.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Commission présidentielle ezalaki eyano na botelemeli boye** (The Presidential Commission is always in conflict) - The text says the commission aims *to* resolve conflict, not *is* in conflict.
* **B: Mampo nampo nami elekaki nde ebimisaki botelemeli yango** (Some and others do not participate, and it becomes its conflict) - This is a disjointed and illogical statement. The text indicates participation, not absence.
* **D: Kotemela ezalaki ntango mosusu na mobulu** (The strike is always in the mob) - This doesn't explain *why* the strike is considered invalid. It just states a fact about its occurrence.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that logically connects the information in the text to the question about the validity of the strike.
"
Nani apesaki likanisi ete CEP ya suka atika mosala?,"The correct answer is **A: Martelly**.

The text states: ""Martelly alapaki ndayi na etuluku ya kokamba maponi ya ntango moke (CEP) esalami na bato minei lobi."" This translates to ""Martelly has called on people to participate in the establishment of the High Council for the Creation of New Jobs (CEP).""  Therefore, Martelly is the one initiating and calling for the CEP to be formed.
"
"Kolandana na liyebisi, nini esungami te na USA Gymnastics nsima na komonisa mpasi basani ya Nassar?","The correct answer is **A: Kolongolama ya mokanda (Certification)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...emonisi ete matonda ya ba athlètes pe ya ba ekipe na biso, pe masano na bango, tokoki kokokisa yango malamu soki tosali mbongwana ebongi na ebongiseli na biso, kaka te kolongola ba certificat.""

This means that simply providing certifications wasn't enough. They needed more than just certifications to rebuild trust.
"
"Kolandana na liyebisi, mokano monene ya Gimnastique ya USA mpe ya komite olympique ya Etats-Unis ezali nini mpo na kokende liboso?","The correct answer is **A: Kongenga mwinda na mabe ya Larry Nassar**.

The passage explicitly states that the US Gymnastics organization and the US Olympic Committee are working together **because** of the serious abuse by Larry Nassar.  Their goal is to rebuild trust and create a safer environment for gymnasts due to the harm caused by his actions. The entire passage revolves around addressing the aftermath of that abuse.
"
Masuwa ezalaki kokende wapi ntango likambo yango esalemaki? ,"The correct answer is **D: Japon**.

The text states: ""Masuwa ya bitumba ebengami Avenger oyo elongolaka babombe, ezalaki kokende na Puerto Princesa na Palawan. Asalaka na masuwa ya nsambo ya basoda ya Etats-Unis oyo babundaka na mai mpe esalaka na Sasebo, na Nagasaki **na Japon**.""

This clearly indicates that the market is held in Japan, specifically in Sasebo and Nagasaki. While it mentions Puerto Princesa and Palawan, this is where the Avenger ships *went*, not where the market is held.
"
Oyo ezali likambo ya solo te na oyo etali masuwa oyo balobeli na mokapo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ezali kopesama mpo na Flotte ya Sambo ya Marine ya U.S.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Masuwa ya bitumba ebengami Avenger oyo elongolaka babombe, ezalaki kokende na Puerto Princesa na Palawan. Asalaka na masuwa ya nsambo ya basoda ya Etats-Unis oyo babundaka na mai mpe esalaka na Sasebo, na Nagasaki na Japon.""  This translates to: ""The flight operations of the Avenger-class aircraft carriers, which are deployed by the Navy, are going to Puerto Princesa and Palawan. They operate from the dry docks of U.S. Navy ships and are stationed in Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan.""

* **Option D reflects this:**  The passage details that the carriers operate from the dry docks of US Navy ships. This strongly implies they are part of the US Navy fleet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezalaki na nzela na yango mpo na kokende na Puerto Princesa** (It is on its way to Puerto Princesa) - While it *is* going to Puerto Princesa, this doesn't fully capture the context. It's part of a larger operational deployment.
* **B: Ezali na Palawan** (It is in Palawan) -  The passage mentions Palawan as a destination, not a permanent location.
* **C: Ezali masuwa ya etumba ya mine** (It is a mine warfare carrier) - While the passage refers to ""masuwa ya nsambo"" (dry docks/ships), it doesn't specifically say it is a mine warfare carrier. The primary focus is on the aircraft carrier deployment.



Therefore, option D is the best and most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.



"
Nani apesaki maloba maye matali basoda ya Etats-Unis?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The question states: ""Na Lomingo eleki, President ya Etats-Unis Donald Trump, na maloba oyo sekretere na ye alobaki, alobaki ete basoda ya Etats-Unis bakolongwa na Syrie."" (In Lomingo, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, in a statement his secretary made, said that US troops were withdrawn from Syria.)

Therefore, Donald Trump is the one who made the statement about the withdrawal of US troops.
"
"Kolandana na liyebisi, mboka nini ezwaki mokumba ya kokengela babundi oyo bakangami?","The correct answer is **A: Syrie**.

Here's why:

The text states that the US is withdrawing troops from **Syria**, and that Turkey is involved in combating ISIS, which is active in **Syria**. The text also mentions Europe's concern about ISIS threatening it, but the initial action (troop withdrawal) is happening in Syria.
"
Bato bakanisaka ete nini nde esalaki motuka yango ekwea?,"The correct answer is **A: Esika ya makasi (A place of expertise)**.

The text states: ""Bakanisi ete mbala mosusu eutaki na moto ya makasi"" which translates to ""They say that many times they need a person of expertise/knowledge.""  This directly points to the need for an expert to find where the acid is leaking.
"
Na lolenge nini ya mabele likámá yango esalemaki?,"The correct answer is **D: Ezali na bangomba (It's due to bacteria)**.

The text states: ""Aksida esalemaki na likolo mpenza na likolo ya ngomba..."" which translates to ""Oxygen doesn't appear in the air of the gut...""  The passage further mentions that it's ""Ezali na bangomba"" meaning ""It's due to bacteria"".  Bacteria are responsible for anaerobic digestion in the gut, which prevents oxygen from being produced.
"
Bakonzi bazali kolikya nini mpo na mpela yango?,"The correct answer is **D: Bisika mingi oyo banyama ya zamba efandaka** (Large areas where marine animals feed).

Here's why:

The text states that the dam's construction in 1963 negatively impacted the marine environment, specifically affecting areas where marine animals feed. The text mentions a significant decrease in fish populations and the disappearance of seaweed and even hair algae, indicating a disruption to the ecosystem.  The authorities are concerned about restoring these areas so marine life can return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kozongisama ya ba barres ya sable** (Restoration of sandbars): While sandbars are part of the marine environment, the text doesn't specifically mention sandbar restoration as the concern.
*   **B: Bokeli ya ba plages** (Expansion of beaches):  The text doesn't mention beach expansion.
*   **C: Motángo ya ba chubs ya humpback oyo ebakisami** (Migration patterns of humpback whales): While the whales are impacted, the focus is on the broader ecosystem and feeding grounds, not specifically their migration patterns.



"
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi botongi ya barrage esimbaki mpo na libela?","The correct answer is **C: Bisika oyo banyama ya zamba bafandaka (The place where animals gather)**.

The text states that before the dam was built, the area was a ""bisika zelo ekangama mpe mabongo, oyo ezalaki bisika ya kofanda na banyama"" which translates to ""a large swamp and mud, which was a place where animals gathered."" The dam's construction flooded this area, causing the problems described.
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nani apesaki na mayele ya laibateli yaEtats-Unis oyo etali bibundi oyo ekoki kozala?","The correct answer is **A: Bato ya Somalie oyo balekisaka ndelo**.

Here's why:

The text states the US Embassy in Nairobi praised the ""Somali children"" for their efforts to help those affected by the bombing, both in Kenya and Ethiopia.  This implies the Somali children are the ones who took action. Therefore, the Somali children are the ones who are being praised for their efforts. The sentence ""Bato ya Somalie oyo balekisaka ndelo"" translates to ""Somali children who took action.""
"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola ndenge ya kobunda ya botelemi ya?","The correct answer is **C: Kopanza babombe na bisika ya ntina na mikili mibale**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the US Embassy in Nairobi and Kenya has expressed ""serious concern"" about the ""Somali militants.""
* It mentions they are seeking to prevent attacks *and* to assist those affected by attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia.
* The passage also emphasizes the US concern about the militants' activities being a ""grave matter"" in Ethiopia and Kenya.

This suggests the US is advocating for addressing the issue of these militants in a comprehensive manner, encompassing both preventing attacks (which implies a focused effort in specific locations) and providing support to victims (which requires a broader approach).  The combination of ""bisika ya ntina"" (sensitive areas/locations) and ""mikili mibale"" (broad/extensive) best represents the dual approach described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kopanza babɔmbe na bisika ya ntina na mboka moko** (Focusing on militants in one specific location) - This is too narrow. The passage mentions concerns in *both* Kenya and Ethiopia.
* **B: Kopanzana babombe na mikili mibale** (Focusing on militants in broad areas) - This is too vague.  The passage implies a need to address the militants in *specific* places to prevent attacks.
* **D: Kopanza ba bombe na mboka moko** (Focusing on militants in one country) -  Again, this ignores the concerns about activities in both Kenya and Ethiopia.



"
"Na kati ya bato oyo elandi, nani azali avocat te?","The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Petros Mantouvalos, moto ya parlema mpe **avoka**..."" which translates to ""Petros Mantouvalos, a member of parliament and **lawyer**...""

The text says Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are lawyers (""avoka""). Makis Triantafylopoulos is identified as a journalist, not a lawyer. Evangelos Kalousis is also a lawyer but isn't listed as being in the group of people in question with the options.



"
Etuluku nini ya bato balobelami te ete bazali na kati ya likambo ya nsɔni na kati ya lisangá ya mibeko ya Grèce?,"The answer is **B: Bazuzi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""likambo mabe monene na kati ya lisanga ya bato ya Greke ebimaki na ndenge babimisaki makambo ya kobuka mibeko oyo bazuzi..."" This translates to: ""the very serious thing in the unity of the Greek people is how they violate the rules that the elders/wise men/wise people...""  Therefore, the elders/wise men/wise people (bazuzi) are the ones who are violating the rules.
"
Ba guichets boni ebungaki na Inde?,"The correct answer is **D: 36**.

The question states: ""Inde azwaki bapoint 36 pamba..."" which translates to ""India scored 36 points...""
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, pwe nini ezalaki ya likolo ya masanos?","The answer is **B: 36 mbangu**.

The question asks about the number of points India scored. The text states: ""Inde azwaki bapoint 36 pamba..."" which translates to ""India scored 36 points...""
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ntina ya kozanga bosepeli ya Adam Cuerden te?","The correct answer is **A: Politiki ya sika ya site oyo etali makambo ya kosangisa nzoto**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Adam Cuerden is known for ""politiki ya sika ya site oyo etali makambo ya kosangisa nzoto"" - literally ""the political history of the site which is about making connections"".  This is the core of what he's known for, according to the text. The passage describes this as ""milende ya sika ya kobimisa mobeko etali makambo ya kosangisa nzoto,"" meaning ""historic trends in fostering connections through networking.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kolongolama ya mayemi ya Pays de Galles (The history of Wales):** While he is from Wales, the text focuses on his *political* role and network-building, not just his Welsh history.
*   **C: Koyokama te na Pays de Galles (Not being famous in Wales):** The passage explicitly mentions his work within Wales.
*   **D: Lokuta na ntina ya bolongoli ya boyebi (Studying the origin of understanding):** This is not mentioned in the passage.

"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini elongolamaki na site?","The correct answer is **B: Makambo ya kosangisa nzoto (Content creation)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Adam Cuerden is organizing a community to create content for Wikinews.  It specifically mentions building a community focused on **""kosangisa nzoto mpona site oyo eza na bamilo ya bavideo mpe bafoto""** which translates to ""content creation for a site with video and photo uploads.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Boyebi (Knowledge/Understanding):** While the community will generate knowledge through articles, the core action is *creating* the content, not simply possessing or sharing knowledge.
* **C: Projet ya politique générale (General political project):** There's no mention of a political project in the text.
* **D: Bamedia ya moto moko (Media of a single person):** The text emphasizes a *community* effort, not the media of one person.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi Amir Khan azali kosunga te?","The correct answer is **B: Bawelani ya Angleterre**.

The text states that Amir Khan shook hands with the British athletes at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.  Therefore, he is associated with the British team.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kati na oyo elandi Amir Khan akozala kosunga ata soki azali na makanisi na ye moko?","The correct answer is **A: Babundisi ya basi**.

The text states: ""Na motema na ngai nakanisi basi basengeli kobunda te. Eza makanisi na ngai."" (In my opinion, buses should not be allowed to drive. It is unacceptable to me.) This directly indicates that Amir Khan is concerned about bus drivers.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Baninga na ye oyo bazalaki kobunda na masano ya Olympique ya 2004:** While he won a medal in 2004, the text doesn't say he's concerned about those specific bus drivers from that time.
*   **C: Masano olympiques 2012:** The text mentions the 2012 Olympics as the location where he shook hands with athletes, but not as a reason for his concern about buses.
*   **D: Bato mosusu oyo bazwaki bamedayi ya palata:**  The text does not mention other medalists in any way.



"
Peter Lenz akufaki ntango nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Na lopitalo**.

The text states: ""...bamemaki ye na lopitalo moko ya mboka wana esika akufaki na nsima."" which translates to ""...they took him to a major hospital where he died."" Therefore, Peter Lenz died *in the hospital*.
"
Xavier Zayat azali nani?,"The correct answer is **B: Mopoti mbangu mosusu (Another racer)**.

The text states: ""Na mbala moko bayambaki ye na bato ya lopitalo mpe bamemaki ye na lopitalo moko ya mboka wana esika akufaki na nsima. **Moto ya mboka na ye Xavier Zayat atutaki ye.**""  This translates to: ""Once, he met with people at the hospital and was taken to a nearby hospital where he was admitted. **His fellow racer Xavier Zayat was there.**"" 

Therefore, Xavier Zayat was another racer.
"
Na ezalela nini moto oyo azali kotungisa mpɛpɔ akoki kozwa matomba soki ayebaki ndenge oyo mpɛpɔ esalaka na kati?,"The correct answer is **B: Soki koyina na bango kopumbwa ezali na katikati ya bobangi ya makambo oyo eyebani te.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding the *mechanism* of the wind.** It states that knowing how the wind works allows you to predict and potentially counteract its effects.  This directly relates to the idea of understanding the core principles (""katikati ya bobangi"") of something.
* The question asks what allows someone to *correct* the wind. This suggests understanding its fundamental workings.
* Option B highlights that the core workings are key to correction – that understanding the heart of the matter allows for effective intervention.
* The other options are not directly supported by the passage:
    * A focuses on being able to stop the wind, which isn't the focus of the passage.
    * C is too general.  It doesn't tie to understanding the wind's mechanics.
    * D speaks of unrelated issues and scientific concepts.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the passage's message."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo azali kosala mobembo asengeli kosala mpo na koumela?","The correct answer is **C: Kokanisa ntalo kati na bakompanyi mingi ya mibembo (Coordinating between many wind companies)**.

Here's why:

* **The Problem:** The problem describes inconsistent wind patterns causing fluctuating power generation.  Multiple wind companies are operating independently, leading to instability.
* **The Solution:**  To address this, the different wind companies need to work together.  Coordinating their operations (perhaps sharing forecast data, adjusting turbine settings, or temporarily curtailing power generation in certain areas) would help stabilize the grid and improve predictability.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Luka makabo ya bakompanyi ya mibembo mingi (Analyzing data from many wind companies):** While data analysis is important, it doesn't *solve* the problem. It helps understand the problem, but coordination is needed to *fix* it.
* **B: Zua esika mbala moko na kopanyi ya mpepo (Being present once at a wind company):** A single visit is insufficient to address a systemic issue affecting multiple companies.
* **D: Talasite Internet ya kompanyi ya mpepo (Visiting the wind company's website):**  The website provides information, but it doesn't resolve the operational issues causing the power fluctuations.



Therefore, coordination among the wind companies is the most logical and effective solution to the problem described.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini bato oyo basalaka mibembo basengeli kosala liboso mpo na kozwa ntalo ya mpɛpɔ oyo eleki malamu?","The correct answer is **A: Talasite Internet ya kompanyi ya mpepo (Check the company's website)**.

Here's why:

* **The problem description:** The question states that wind farm operators frequently check the company's website for information about outages and restoration efforts. This strongly implies that the website is the primary source for updates and information.
* **Why other options are less likely:**
    * **B: Tala talo na bitondisi mingi (Check detailed reports):** While detailed reports might exist, the problem states that people check the website *first* for a quick update.
    * **C: Zua esika mbala moko na kopanyi ya mpepo (Go to the wind company once):** This is impractical and inefficient.  It doesn't provide ongoing updates.
    * **D: Zua esiki mbala moko na biro ya mobembo (Go to the wind farm office once):** This is also impractical and not a reliable way to get regular information.

Therefore, the website is the logical and described method for wind farm operators to stay informed about the situation.
"
Ntango nini moninga asengeli kokende elongo mpo na kotika biloko?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntango biloko ezali kotindama lokola mokumba endimami**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Pamba ya kokende noki ezalaki ya kotinda yango lokola bifunda basi batala. Mibeko ya mibembo ya mpepo ekopesa nzela te kotinda bifunda kozanga kolo na yango, wana esika baza na mposa na yo."" (The way to ship fabrics is to pack them as rolls and pallets. Air freight regulations do not allow packaging rolls for extended periods, which is why they are at a disadvantage.)

This clearly indicates that the fabric needs to be shipped as rolls and pallets *when* it's being airfreighted. Options A and B are incorrect because the text emphasizes the difficulty of long-term storage for rolls under air freight regulations. Option D isn't directly supported by the text.



"
"Na kotalela eteni yango, ntango ozali kopona kompanyi ya mpepo ya Frequent Flyer na boyokani, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi osengeli kotya na esika ya liboso?","The correct answer is **C: Kopanyi ya mpepo oyo otambolaka na yango mbala mingi**.

Here's why:

The question asks where you should *focus* your efforts when building frequent flyer miles. The prompt states that airlines often offer bonus miles and points to companies that fly with them frequently. Therefore, the airline you fly with most often will be the one most likely to reward you with the most miles.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best:

*   **A: Kopanyi ya mpepo oyo epesaka pwe mingi:** While a good option, earning miles isn't *just* about the airline offering the most. It's about consistently flying with *one* airline.
*   **B: Kopanyi ya mpepo kati na boyokani ya munene:** This is too broad. It doesn't specify which airline to focus on.
*   **D: Kopanyi yam pepo oyo ekoki kobakisa libaku malamu ya kobakisa:** While beneficial, this isn't the primary focus. Consistent flying is more important than occasional bonus offers.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani akoki kopesa pwe ya kopanyi mbala mingi koleka?","The correct answer is **B: Compagnie na yo ya avion oyo osalaka mibembo mingi na se ya alliance moko.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** Who can offer more frequent rewards?
* **The premise states:**  A company that flies frequently and has a strong alliance with other airlines tends to offer more frequent rewards and points.
* **Option B directly reflects this:** It highlights a company (your airline) that flies extensively and has a strong alliance. This is the most logical reason for increased reward opportunities.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kopanyi yam pepo mosusu na bosangani mosusu (More frequent flights on more routes):**  While more flights are good, the question specifically asks about *rewards*.  More routes don't guarantee better reward programs.
* **C: Kopanyi na yo ya mpepo oyo otambolaka mbala mingi na yango kati na bosangani mosusu (Your airline that flies frequently on specific routes within a network):** This is too narrow. It focuses on a limited route network.
* **D: Kopanyi ya mpepo kati na bosangani moko (Airline within a single network):** This option limits the potential reward opportunities, as it doesn't consider alliances with other airlines.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eteni nini ya nzoto kati na oyo elandi ekoki kobeba mpo na komɛla masanga mingi?","The correct answer is **A: Koyoka**.

The text states that ""Masanga ezalaka na bopusi ndenge moko te na bato nyonso, pe eza ntina mingi oyeba esika osukaka."" This implies that the disease is spread through **contact**, specifically through touching contaminated surfaces or objects. Therefore, the action of ""koyoka"" (touching) is the most likely way to contract the disease.

The other options are less likely:

*   **Komona (Seeing):** Seeing the disease doesn't cause it.
*   **Elengi (Thinking/Reasoning):**  Thinking or reasoning doesn't transmit a disease.
*   **Nsolo (Hearing):** Hearing about the disease doesn't cause it.



"
"Lokola elobami na mokapo yango, nini ekoki kokitisa bopusi mabe ya masanga?","The correct answer is **B: Komela masanga ya makasi oyo ebimisami na ndenge oyo eyokani te na mibeko** (Avoid strong, adulterated alcohol).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that ""Bilimo ya mabe ekoki kozala na biloko ya mbindo oyo eza likama ata pe méthanol, oyo ekoki koboma miso to koboma yo ata soki ozwi yango moke mpenza.""  This translates to ""Harmful substances can be in these alcohols which are even adulterated with methanol, which can damage the liver or the eyes even if you are not aware of it.""
*  ""Masanga ya makasi oyo ebimisami na ndenge oyo eyokani te na mibeko"" directly addresses this issue of adulterated alcohol containing harmful substances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komela masanga elongo na methanol** (Avoid alcohol that is strong in methanol) - While methanol is dangerous, the options don't reflect the primary danger. Avoiding *any* strong, unidentified alcohol is better than just methanol.
* **C: Komela masanga na bokatikati** (Avoid alcohol that is mixed) - While mixing alcohol *can* be dangerous, the core problem highlighted is adulteration with harmful substances, not just the mixing itself.
* **D: Komela na bato ndenge na ndenge** (Avoid people) - This is completely irrelevant to the discussion about alcohol poisoning.



"
Wapi mwa ndambo ya motuya ya biloko oyo eleki likoló na Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: District ya Canal**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Etuka ya Canal (na néerlandais: Grachtengordel) eza etuka ya ekeke ya 17 oyo eyebana mingi, ezalaka zingazinga ya Binnenstad d'Amsterdam."" This translates to: ""Canal Ring (in Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a 17th-century ring that is closely connected, it is a major feature of the Binnenstad of Amsterdam.""
* The Binnenstad (Inner City) is essentially *within* the Canal Ring.
* Option A directly identifies the Canal District as the location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na esika nyonso oyo e eponamaki lokola UNESCO, libula y amokili mobimba** (In all places it is recognized as UNESCO, the canal is very famous): While true, it doesn't specify the *location* where the event occurs.
* **C: Bitando oyo elongolamaki na Binnenstad** (Places that emerge in the Binnenstad): This is too vague. The canal ring is the encompassing feature.
* **D: Bisika oyo ezali na motuya ya lisolo ya bato** (Places that are on the ground level):  While canals are on ground level, this isn't a specific geographical area.



"
Mpo na nini Etuka ya Canal eponamaki lokola Libula ya Mokili mobimba na UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: Ezali motuya na ntina ya makambo eleki mpe na ntina ya bokoko** (It's a testament to remarkable historical and cultural value).

The provided text explicitly states: ""Etuka mobimba eza Libula ya Mokili mobimba na UNESCO mpona bokoko na yango pe ntina na yango na masolo ya kala..."" which translates to ""The canal belt is a UNESCO World Heritage site for its historical and cultural value...""

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the reason. Options B and D are incorrect because they don't reflect the information given in the text. Option C is partially true (it *is* a major part of the city center), but the text highlights its historical and cultural *value*, not just its location.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalaka ete kokende na Phnom Krom ezala na ntina?","The correct answer is **B: Kosala mobembo na nzela ya Angkor Pass**.

The text explicitly states: ""Angkor eza ntina mingi mpona kokota na tempelo, yango wana kobosana te komema passeport na yo ntango ozokende na Tonlé Sap."" This means you need an Angkor Pass to visit Phnom Krom, as it's part of the Angkor temple complex.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esengeli mpo ete bapaya bákota na Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **A: Komata koleka tempelo ya Yasovarman (Visit the Yasovarman temple).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tempelo oyo eza na mawa ngomba batongaki yango na suka ya ekeke ya 9, na nse ya boyangeli ya mokonzi Yasovarma."" (This temple is 9 km southwest of Siem Reap and is located on the banks of the Tonlé Sap Lake, built in the reign of King Yasovarman.) and ""Esika ya koleka na Angkor eza ntina mingi mpona kokota na tempelo, yango wana kobosana te komema passeport na yo ntango ozokende na Tonlé Sap."" (Visiting Angkor is very important for seeing the temples, therefore you don't need to present a passport when you go to Tonlé Sap.)  This implies that the main attraction of Phnom Krom is the temple itself, built by Yasovarman. The passage encourages visiting the temple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kosala mobembo zingazinga ya Siem Reap (Visit the bustling Siem Reap markets):** While Siem Reap markets are a great place to visit, the passage doesn't directly link visiting the markets to the experience of Phnom Krom.
* **C: Kozwa makoki ya koleka ya Angkor (Book an Angkor pass):**  The passage says you *don't* need an Angkor pass to visit Tonlé Sap, which is near Phnom Krom.  This option contradicts the information provided.
* **D: Kokende na masuwa zingazinga ya Tonle Sap (Go to the bustling Tonlé Sap markets):**  The passage mentions the Tonlé Sap Lake and its banks, but doesn't specifically say visiting the markets there is essential to experiencing Phnom Krom.

Therefore, visiting the temple built by Yasovarman is the most relevant activity when going to Phnom Krom.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kopekisa mopaya akende kotala Antarctique?","The best answer is **C: Manaka ya mosala oyo epesaka nzela ya kosala mobembo na sanza ya zomi na mibale mpe ya sanza ya yambo.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Kokende kotala bamboka bapaya esengaka mbongo mingi, kozala nzoto kolongono, pe ekoki kosalema kaka na sanza ya zomi na moko kino ya mibale, pe esukaka kaka na esanga, na bisanga pe na mbu Ross."" This means expeditions to Antarctica are incredibly expensive, dangerous, and require specialized equipment and logistics.

* **Option C directly addresses these challenges:**  It highlights that the *opportunity* to conduct research with the necessary resources (specialized equipment, support, etc.) is what would drive someone to go.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Budget ya mobembo monene:** While a large budget *is* necessary, it's not the *reason* someone would choose to go.  It's a prerequisite, not the motivating factor.
* **B: Intérêt seul ya ko explorer Mbu Ross:** Exploring Ross Island alone isn't a sufficient reason for a full expedition to Antarctica.  It's a specific location within a much larger, and much more challenging, environment.
* **D: Koningisa nzoto ezali na ndelo:** While survival skills are important, the text focuses on the logistical and financial hurdles of getting *to* Antarctica, not just surviving once there.  Survival skills alone wouldn't make it feasible.



Therefore, option C best captures the core reason someone would undertake such a challenging and expensive journey.



"
Mopaya oyo alingaka komata bangomba akoki kokende na eteni nini ya Antarctique?,"The correct answer is **B: Etando ya Inland**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kokende kotala bamboka bapaya esengaka mbongo mingi, kozala nzoto kolongono, pe ekoki kosalema kaka na sanza ya zomi na moko kino ya mibale, pe esukaka kaka na esanga, na bisanga pe na mbu Ross. Antarctique ya kati eza plateau oyo eza yango moko, eza na glace ya 2-3 km. Bampepo mosusu oyo ekendaka ntango mosusu na bisika ya mabele, mpona komata bangomba to kokoma na songe, oyo eza na esika ya monene.""

This translates to: ""Going to explore the interior is very expensive, it's a risky journey, and it can only be done with a small amount of supplies and a few vehicles, and it only goes through the Ross Ice Shelf, through the mountains and through the mountains. Central Antarctica is a single plateau, 2-3 km of ice. Most expeditions go to the interior to collect samples or to make a base, which is in a remote area.""

Therefore, the interior (""Etando ya Inland"") is where expeditions go to collect samples or establish a base.
"
Esika ya kotala y akoya liboso na makambo ya sika ezali wapi?,"The correct answer is **A: Na esika oyo okoki kokota na yango kozanga mpasi** (In a place where you can observe it closely).

Here's why:

The question asks where you can *observe* celestial objects. The passage states that observatories are now often located in remote, dark locations away from city lights. Therefore, the best answer is a place where you can see things clearly and without light pollution, which is a remote location. Options B, C, and D all describe places that are typically *not* ideal for astronomical observation due to light pollution or limited visibility.
"
Ekoki kozala ete télescope ya bolukiluki ya mikolo na biso ekozala wapi?,"The correct answer is **D: Na esika moko monene (In a very remote location)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that observatories now need to be located in remote areas, away from light pollution, to function effectively. This is because telescopes are very sensitive and are affected by artificial light. Options A, B, and C don't fully capture the need for isolation from light pollution. Option D, ""In a very remote location,"" is the most accurate description of where modern telescopes are situated.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, esika nini ekozala malamu mpo na mokolo ya kimya na libongo?","The correct answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mabongo ya Tamaki Drive ezalaka na libongo ya Waitemata, na basonge ya malamu ya Mission Bay na St Heliers na katikati ya Auckland.""  This translates to: ""The Waitemata Harbor is located near Mission Bay and St Heliers in the middle of Auckland.""

The question asks where it's nice for a picnic on a sunny day. Mission Bay is specifically mentioned as being near the harbor and is generally considered a pleasant location for leisure activities. While St Heliers is also mentioned, Mission Bay is a more prominent and commonly known picnic spot within the described area. The North Harbor District and Waitemata Harbor are broader locations, not specific spots for picnics.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, esika nini emonani kozala na libateli malamu mpo na kobeta mai ?","The correct answer is **D: Long Bay**.

The passage states: ""Mabongo ya ndambo ya nordi (na etuka ya North Harbour) ezalaka na mbu ya Pacifique mpe ebandaka na **Long Bay** na nordi ya Devonport na sudi.""

This translates to: ""The waters of the North Harbour (in the North Shore area) are on the Pacific coast and extend to **Long Bay** north of Devonport.""  Therefore, Long Bay is where the water is best for kayaking.
"
"Ntango ozali kotala esika oyo mokapo yango elobeli, oyo wapi na makambo oyo elandi ekotalelama lokola oyo ebongi te?","The correct answer is **B: Kotika elembo esika moko boye zingazinga ya esika yango (To stay in one place and observe the details of the location).**

Here's why:

The passage is about the Holocaust and the dangers of repeating history. It emphasizes the importance of remembering and learning from the past.  It strongly condemns actions like genocide and denial.

The question asks what is *not* something that should be done when observing the location described (presumably a place connected to the events of the Holocaust). 

* **A: Kosala makambo ya lokumu (To do things casually/without seriousness)** is incorrect because the situation is serious and requires respect.
* **C: Kosala maseki (To make sacrifices)** is not directly addressed in the passage as something wrong. While sacrifice was made by many, the passage focuses on preventing future atrocities.
* **D: Kokatakata eloko moko oyo etongami (To focus on one single thing that happened)** is incorrect. The passage emphasizes looking at the *details* and the *broader context* (""zingazinga ya esika yango"" - the details and the overall context of the location).

Therefore, the best answer is **B**, which aligns with the passage's message of thoughtful observation and understanding of a complex and tragic history.
"
"Na kati na yango, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola minoko oyo esanganisi minoko mingi?","The correct answer is **D: Organique**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eza ya kokabwana na lingua francas, oyo eza na minoko ya malamu **to ya organique** oyo bato oyo balobaki minoko mosusu bakomaki kosalela mingi to ntina moko to mosusu.""

This translates to: ""It's a type of lingua franca, which is made up of **formal or organic** language that people who speak many languages tend to use a lot or one or the other.""

The passage specifically links ""organique"" to the nature of the language found in lingua francas. Therefore, ""organique"" is the correct choice.
"
Liloba nini elimboli na bosikisiki te minoko ya lisalisi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ezali minoko oyo ezali na ndenge ya bomoto mpe oyo etongami**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes ""balokota ya mike"" as mimicking a ""lingua franca"" formed by frequent interactions. This suggests the language arises organically from the needs of the group, not through conscious construction.
* Option B, ""Ezali minoko oyo ezali na ndenge ya bomoto mpe oyo etongami"" (It is a language that is organic and evolves), best captures this idea of a language developing naturally through interaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezali minoko biologiquess oyo esalelamaka mpo na kosalisa kosolola kati ya batu oyo bakoki kososola na bango te** (It is a biological language that is used to facilitate communication between people who can understand it).  While ""biological"" is mentioned in the passage, the key is the *organic* development, not simply its biological nature.  Also, the passage doesn't explicitly state that everyone *can* understand it.
* **C: Ezali minoko oyo etongami mpo na kobongisa ba Makambo ya kosolola** (It is a language that is created to resolve conflict). The passage focuses on facilitating communication and interaction, not necessarily resolving conflicts directly.
* **D: Ezali minoko oyo esalemi oyo ezali na bokonzi kati na balobi ya minoko ndenge na ndenge** (It is a system that is organized within the words of the speakers in a word-for-word manner).  This implies a structured, pre-planned language, which contradicts the idea of organic development.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mokumbi motuka asengeli kotala nini soki mobembo na bango ya masuwa ezali na eleko ya malili?","The correct answer is **B: Bosengeli ya visa (Need a visa)**.

Here's why:

The text states that people in Saint Petersburg who are in contact with the Baltic Sea (specifically the area where the oil spill is) *must* obtain a visa (landela masengami).  The question asks what someone should do if they see this happening and the source of the oil spill is small. The implication is that even a small spill requires a visa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esika ya kabine (Cabin location):**  The text mentions cabins are where the situation is observed, but it doesn't say that's what the person needs to do.
* **C: Maloba (Information):** While information might be helpful, the text explicitly states a visa is required.
* **D: Ntango oyo balekisaka na engumba (The point of contact with the oil):** The text focuses on the location where the spill is observed, not the specific point of contact.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is that a visa is required.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, soki mobembo ya mobembo ya mokumbi motuka ezali na eleko ya molunge, nini bakoki kozala na likoki ya kokima?","The correct answer is **C: Bosengeli ya visa**.

Here's why:

* The text states that people working in Saint Petersburg cannot obtain visas (landela masengami - see the documents).
* The question asks what they *can* do given the situation (ice is causing problems).
* Therefore, the answer points to the restriction that they can't get visas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntango na engumba (In the sky)** - This is irrelevant to the situation described.
* **B: Koleka na kati ya glace (To break through the ice)** -  While potentially a solution to the ice problem, the text doesn't say they *can* do this; it focuses on the visa issue.
* **D: Saint Petersburg** -  Saint Petersburg is the location of the problem, not a solution.



"
Mpo na nini basalelaka mingi monoko ya Catalan mpo na bilembo mpe mayebisi na Barcelone?,"The best answer is **B: Ezalaki monoko ya liboso officiel na engumba (It is the official language of the region).**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Bilembo mingi ezolakisa kaka na Catalan po endimami na mibeko lokola lokota ya leta."" (Many official documents are written only in Catalan for administrative purposes like the government.) This directly indicates Catalan is the official language.
* **Option A is incorrect:** While many people prefer Catalan, the text doesn't state that the majority *prefer* it. It indicates a strong administrative role for Catalan.
* **Option C is incorrect:**  ""Bato balingaka mingi"" (people like it a lot) is subjective and doesn't explain the *reason* for its dominance in official contexts.
* **Option D is partially true, but not the primary reason:**  The metro and public transport using Catalan is a consequence of Catalan being the official language, not the core reason *why* it's used.  The fact that transport systems have multilingual signage is a practical accommodation, not the reason for the priority of Catalan.



Therefore, the most accurate and supported answer based on the text is **B**.



"
"Na minoko oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalelamaka na Système ya Metro ya Barcelone mpo na kopesa mayebisi mbala na mbala?","The correct answer is **A: Anglais**.

The text states: ""Mayebisi ya mbla na mbala na Metro epesamaka kaka na lokota ya Catalan, kasi mbongwana ya mbalakaka bayebisaka yango na nzela ya ebongiseli moko ya automatique na balokota mingi na ndakisa lokota ya Espagnol, **Anglais**, Français, Arabe mpe Japonais.""

This translates to: ""The announcements on the Metro are only in Catalan, but the information is displayed using a single automatic system on many trains that also includes Spanish, **English**, French, Arabic and Japanese.""
"
"Na kotalela mokapo, nini kati na biloko oyo elandi ekoki kozala te na esika ya liboso na mbeto mpe bilei ya ntɔ́ngɔ́ ya likoló?","The correct answer is **D: WiFi ya mbangu**.

Here's why:

The passage describes that B&Bs are increasingly offering amenities like slow internet and beautiful scenery. It then asks what you *can't* expect to find regularly at a bed and breakfast.

*   **A: Biloko ya kolia ya bomoko mpenza (Expensive food):** While some B&Bs might offer nice food, it's not a standard expectation.
*   **B: Biloko ya ndako ya kala oyo ekokani na mosusu te (Remote, isolated locations):** While some B&Bs might be remote, they are increasingly offering amenities to attract guests.
*   **C: Bisika ya libanda oyo ebatelami malamu (Popular tourist spots):** B&Bs are often located in less crowded areas, not bustling tourist hubs.
*   **D: WiFi ya mbangu (High-speed internet):** The passage specifically mentions slow internet as a trend, implying that *high-speed* internet is not a regular expectation at many B&Bs. 

Therefore, **WiFi ya mbangu** is the most likely thing you wouldn't regularly find at a B&B given the context."
"Na kotalela eteni oyo, na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali te moko ya makambo minene ya momekano kati na ba B&B ya kitoko?","The correct answer is **B: Bilei mingi ya elengi ya ntongo oyo epesami (The variety of the natural surroundings offered)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that B&Bs are increasingly appealing due to their natural surroundings: ""bilamba ya bambeto pe bilei ya ntongo"" (the tranquility of nature and the beauty of the countryside). It then goes on to describe specific elements of these surroundings: ""kitoko ya etuka wana to bilei oyo mopaya alingaka mingi"" (the beauty of the landscape or the beautiful views) and ""bilanga ya kikoto pe piscine"" (sunshine and a swimming pool).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kongalisa ya mikolo oyo (The popularity of these days):** While B&Bs are gaining popularity, the passage isn't *primarily* focusing on their popularity. It's focused on *why* they're gaining popularity.
*   **C: Mbeto ya nsuka ya likolo (The tranquility of the location):** Tranquility is a component of the natural surroundings, but the passage highlights the wider *variety* of natural elements.
*   **D: Bilei mpe limeli oyo euti na mboka (The beauty and the amenities offered):** While amenities are mentioned (like pools), the main focus remains on the *natural surroundings* themselves.



Therefore, **B** best encapsulates the main theme and strongest reason for B&B appeal according to the passage."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kati na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekosalema na Pékin te na 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Milulu ya bosukisi (Ski Jumps)**.

The text states: ""Komekama misusu ya ski ekosalema na esika ya kosala ski ya Taizicheng na Zhangjiakou, oyo eza pene ya 220 km (140 miles) ya Pékin."" This means ski jumping events took place in the locations of Taizicheng and Zhangjiakou, which are outside of Beijing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Milulu ya bofungoli (Bobsleigh):** The text explicitly mentions bobsleigh as a sport held in Beijing.
* **B: Milulu ya esika ya ski ya Taizicheng (Taizicheng Ski Jump):** This is a location *outside* of Beijing, so it's incorrect.
* **D: Milulu ya glace ya kati ya ndako (Indoor Ice Skating):** The text mentions indoor ice skating as part of the Beijing Olympics.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi na oyo elandi ekoyambama na Pékin na 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Masno olympique ya eleko ya malili (Winter Olympic Games)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Engumba ya Beijing na Chine yango nde ekoyamba masano ya Olympiques ya eleko ya mpio makasi ya 2022..."" which translates to ""The Beijing and China team are supporting the 2022 Winter Olympics...""
* It further mentions ""masano ya likolo ya libanga ya malili ya kati ya ndako"" which translates to ""cross-country skiing in the middle of the mountains"". Cross-country skiing is a winter sport.
* Options A and B are too general. While ice sports are part of the Olympics, the passage emphasizes winter sports specifically.
* Option D (Milulu ya bosukisi - Ski resorts) is related but not the *primary* answer.  The overall event is the Winter Olympics.



"
Nani azali na likama mingi ya kozwa grippe aviaire?,"The correct answer is **C: Basali ya nyama ya mboka (Poultry farmers)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mingi etaleli bato basalaka misala ya kobokola bibwele..."" which translates to ""Many are involved in poultry farming...""
* **The passage also mentions:** ""mosala ya kokanga bandeke ezalaka na mwa makama."" which translates to ""the risk of infection is very small.""  This implies the risk is higher in professions related to birds.
* **Poultry farmers (basali ya nyama ya mboka)** are directly exposed to birds, making them at higher risk.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Bato oyo batalaka bandeke (People who don't have infections):** This is incorrect; the question asks who is *more likely* to contract the virus.
* **B: Bato oyo basalaka na banyama oyo ememaka mabele (People who work with wild birds):** While wild birds can carry the virus, the passage focuses more on poultry farming as the primary risk factor.
* **D: Bato oyo bazwaki yango liboso (People who frequently travel):** Frequent travel isn't specifically mentioned as a high-risk factor in the passage.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobeli na bosikisiki grippe ya bandeke?","The correct answer is **B: Bato mingi bazwaki maladi yango koleka bandeke (Many people get the illness rather than the flu)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kasi mosusu ebomaki bango. Mingi etaleli bato basalaka misala ya kobokola bibwele, kasi mosala ya kokanga bandeke ezalaka na mwa makama.""  This translates to ""But most of the time it's mild. It mainly affects people who work with birds, but the infection is rare.""
* This implies that while people *can* get the flu (gripe aviaire), it's often a milder illness than what is typically understood as ""bandeke"" (which refers to severe avian flu). Many people contract the illness without experiencing the severe symptoms associated with ""bandeke"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaka baoyo basali esika ya kobatela soso nde bazwaki grippe yango (They get the flu when they are in close contact with birds).** While contact with birds increases risk, the passage states that infection is *rare* even among those who work with birds.
* **C: Bato oyo batalaka bandɛkɛ bazali na likama ya kozwa maladi yango (People who don't have the flu are likely to get the illness).** This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **D: Nionso oyo elobami na ntina ya batu ezaliki ya liwa (Everything said in the text is false).** This is clearly false, as the text provides information about avian flu.



"
Mbu ya Pembe–Canal Baltique ekangisaka nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Océan Arctique mpe Mbu Baltique**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nzela ya mbu ya mbu Blanche-Baltique esangisaka mbu ya Arctique na mbu ya Baltique..."" which translates to ""The connection of the White-Baltic Sea connects the Arctic Sea and the Baltic Sea...""

Therefore, the White-Baltic Sea connection connects the Arctic Sea and the Baltic Sea.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na lolenge nini ya motuka bakoki kozwa ba passeport mpo na kokata mokumbi maloba te?","The correct answer is **B: Engbunduka ya butu (Biometrics)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na bingbunduka mosusu, mokumbi akoki kozwa ba passeport mpo bakata yo te pongi na yo."" (In many cases, a person can obtain a passport to avoid being recognized.) This implies a method of identification that allows for verification even if the person tries to conceal their identity.

**Biometrics** (engbunduka ya butu) refers to unique biological characteristics used for identification, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, etc.  These are often incorporated into passports and other identity documents to make forgery more difficult and to ensure accurate identification.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bampepo (Documents)**: While documents are used for identification, the text emphasizes a method that helps *avoid* recognition, suggesting something more sophisticated than a simple document.
*   **C: Masuwa (Markets)**: Markets are locations where transactions occur; they don't inherently relate to passport creation.
*   **D: Engbunduka oyo ekatisaka ndelo (A document that records data)**: This is too broad. While passports *are* documents, the text is specifically referring to the data used for identification, which is biometric information.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini bakoki kotala carte na yo kati na Engbunduka mosusu oyo ekatisaka ndelo?","The correct answer is **A: Nsima ya kokita na engbunduka (Upon arrival at the airport)**.

Here's why:

The text explains that to travel on a long distance, you need a passport with your real identity. It also mentions that for international travel, passports are necessary.  Therefore, you'll be required to present your passport, and likely get your identity checked, *upon arrival at the airport* (or similar point of departure) to confirm your identity and travel documents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tango ozali kolala (While sleeping):**  This is irrelevant to the process of obtaining or using a passport.
* **C: Ezuaka inspection te (When there is no inspection):**  Passport checks are almost always required, especially for international travel.
* **D: Na engbunduka oyo ezali kopota mbangu (On a flight that is delayed):** A flight delay doesn't change the requirement to have a valid passport.

Therefore, arriving at the airport is the logical time when you would be required to present your passport and have your identity verified.
"
"Na oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali makambo oyo ekoki kobima mingi ntango ozali kotikala na esika oyo ezali na mikili ya molunge makasi na Singapour?","The correct answer is **C: Konyokwama na kolɛmba ya molunge (Staying hydrated)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that Singapore is located near the equator and experiences high humidity.**  High humidity means sweat evaporates less effectively, making it easy to become dehydrated.
* **Staying hydrated is crucial in hot, humid climates.**  It's the most direct way to combat dehydration.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ntango nini bakoki koyiba (When can you shop?)**  Shopping is not directly related to the challenges of the climate.
* **B: Kozanga kokoma na butike (Staying in shops)** While staying indoors can provide some relief from the heat, it doesn't address the core issue of dehydration caused by humidity.
* **D: kobunga nzela (Using transportation)** Transportation is about getting around, not managing your body's fluid balance.



Therefore, staying hydrated is the most relevant and accurate answer based on the provided text."
Nani akoki kolinga koboya kolya mampa ya Allemagne?,"The correct answer is **A: Moto oyo azali na allergie makasi na noix** (Someone with a severe nut allergy).

Here's why:

The text mentions that German desserts often contain nuts, particularly in pastries like Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen. Therefore, someone with a severe nut allergy would be unable to enjoy many of the treats described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moto oyo alingaka mingi ba desserts ya richesse** (Someone who loves rich desserts): This person *would* enjoy the German desserts described.
* **C: Moto oyo alingaka chocolat te** (Someone who doesn't like chocolate):  While not all German desserts have chocolate, many do, so this isn't a definitive reason to avoid them.
* **D: Moto oyo alingaka bilei ya sukali na esika ya elɛngi ya elengi** (Someone who loves a lot of sugar in their evening snack): Again, many German desserts are quite sugary, so this person *would* likely enjoy them.



"
Biloko ya kolamba na yango nini etalelami lokola eloko ya kobakisa elengi na mapaAllemand?,"The correct answer is **C: Prunes ya mbila**.

The text explicitly states: ""Biloko mingi ya Allemagne oyo basalaka neti mapa ezalaka mpe na badame, bandika ya moyindo, mpe banguba misusu ya nzete. **Biloko mingi ya Allemagne oyo basalaka neti mapa ezalaka mpe na badame, bandika ya moyindo, mpe banguba misusu ya nzete.**""  This translates to ""Many things about Germany that are known from maps are also plums, pastries, and many kinds of nuts."" and further mentions ""baserize na baprunes oyo ebimaka na eleko ya molunge"" (they are filled with plums that are popular with plums).
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ekozala te toli oyo esɛngami mpo na kosala mobembo na budget?","The correct answer is **B: Yeba kokota (flexible) na nivo ya esika oyo ezalii malamu mpo na yo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that being a minimalist isn't about deprivation.** It's about being *flexible* and prioritizing what truly brings you joy.  This implies adjusting your spending to align with your values and needs, and being willing to make choices that fit your budget.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Luká misala ya kokamwa oyo osengeli kosala na boumeli ya mibembo na yo (Track your spending meticulously):**  While tracking is good, the passage focuses on the *mindset* of minimalism, not just the accounting.
* **C: Senga bato mbongo (Borrow things from others):** This isn't a core principle of minimalism, and can create obligations.
* **D: Kitisa ba dépenses lokola biloko ya kolia pe ya kolala (Prioritize spending on food and shelter):**  While food and shelter are necessities, this is too narrow. Minimalism is about prioritizing what brings you value, not *just* basic needs.  It could include spending on experiences, personal growth, or items that genuinely improve your quality of life.



Therefore, **B** best captures the flexible and value-driven nature of minimalism that the passage promotes.  It suggests adapting your spending to fit your needs and budget in a way that aligns with your core values.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani akoki kozala na mokakatano mpo na kosala mobembo na budget moke mpenza?","The best answer is **C: Moto oyo azali kokana kosala na mosika ntango azali kosala mobembo**.

Here's why:

* **The text highlights the paradox of altruism.** It states that people who are truly altruistic don't seek reward, recognition, or even gratitude. They act selflessly.
* **Option C directly reflects this.**  It describes someone who is actively *choosing* to help others without expecting anything in return. They are engaging in acts of kindness (sala mobembo) purely for the sake of helping.
* **Other options are less accurate:**
    * **A & B:** These describe someone who *is* in a state of conflict or internal struggle, not necessarily someone acting altruistically.  A person with ""mokakatano moko"" (one conflict) or ""mikakatano makasi ya ntango"" (very strong conflict) might be battling selfishness, not practicing altruism.
    * **D:**  Creating a program is a *means* to an end, but doesn't necessarily define someone as altruistic. Someone could create a program for publicity or personal gain.


Therefore, **C** most accurately captures the selfless and voluntary nature of the altruism described in the text.



"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola malamu te motuka oyo ezali koleka kati na Point Marion mpe Fairmont?","The correct answer is **C: Batosaka ndelo ya mbangu mingi te (They drive very fast)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bandelo ya vitese oyo batiaka eza na se mingi koleka na biteni ya liboso pe oyo elandi — mbala mingi ezalaka 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — mpe kotosa yango na makambo nyonso eza ntina mingi koleka eloko mosusu.""  This translates to: ""The speeds that are maintained are much higher than on regular roads - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and maneuvering is much more difficult.""

Option C, ""Batosaka ndelo ya mbangu mingi te"" (They drive very fast), directly reflects this information. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ezali na bisika milai ya nzela ya mboka oyo ezali mosika (It's on a narrow, winding side road):** While the road is described as winding, the speed is the *primary* factor making driving difficult.
*   **B: Banzela ekangemi (The cars are slow):** This is the opposite of what the passage says.
*   **D: Service ya téléphone portable esengeli kozala likambo te (Mobile phone service is not available):** The passage states the *opposite* – mobile phone service is *good* on this road.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nini kati na yango esengeli kozala likambo oyo ezali kotungisa mingi basofɛlɛ oyo bazali kosala mobembo na nzela monene ya Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **A: Kokangama na mituka mingi (Frequent traffic)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the road between Point Marion and Fairmont is prone to heavy traffic, especially on weekends and around the airport. It also mentions that the road is narrow, winding, and has sharp curves, making navigation difficult. Finally, it highlights the high use of cell phones by drivers, likely contributing to distractions.

While the other options might be *somewhat* factors, they aren't the primary issue emphasized in the text:

* **B: Kozanga ya service cellulaire oyo ekoki (Reliable cellular service):** The passage actually notes the *opposite* – that cell phone use is a problem because of distractions.
* **C: Kosala tour ya makasi mbangu mingi (Taking very long tours):** The passage doesn't mention tour length as a significant problem.
* **D: Kokutana na misala ya nzela mbala na mbala (Encountering road hazards frequently):**  While the road has hazards (narrowness, curves), the passage primarily focuses on the *volume* of traffic as the biggest problem.



Therefore, **frequent traffic** is the most significant contributor to the difficulties experienced by drivers on this stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburg highway.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esengeli te mpo na kobanda kotambola kti na bangomba?","The correct answer is **A: Likoki ya kobeta mai (Ability to bail water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a canoe is designed to float and travel on water.  However, it also says canoes are prone to taking on water and need to be bailed out to prevent sinking.  The passage specifically mentions that failure to bail water out is a significant reason for capsizing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndenge esika ya likolo mpenza emonani (The way the bottom is shaped):** While the shape of the canoe's bottom is important for stability and speed, it's not the primary factor leading to capsizing.
*   **C: Makoki ya kopumbwa (Ability to paddle):** Paddling is for propulsion and steering, not directly related to preventing capsizing.
*   **D: Mwa ndambo moke ya formation (A single strong formation):** This option is vague and doesn't connect to the risks mentioned in the passage. The passage discusses the general instability of canoes if not handled correctly.

Therefore, the ability to bail water is the critical factor highlighted as essential for preventing a canoe from capsizing.  The passage implies that failing to bail is a major risk."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozala na ntina mpo na mobembo ya malamu na mabanga?","The best answer is **D: Makoki ya kobeta mai (The ability to float)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the primary characteristic allowing the canoe to function.** The text states that a canoe's function is to float and be propelled on water.  Without the ability to float, it can't do anything.
* **Option A (Makoki ya masno oyo ekeyi liboso mpenza - The ability of the materials to be strong) is not the primary function.** While strength is important, it's not the fundamental reason a canoe works.
* **Option B (Oyo eyebanaki liboso na kozinda na mai - That it is always seen on water) describes the *environment* a canoe is used in, not its fundamental characteristic.**
* **Option C (Mokanda ya kosilisa kelasi ya kotambola kati na ngomba - The shape that facilitates movement within the water) is related to *how* a canoe moves, not *why* it can function in the first place.** While shape is important for movement, it relies on the canoe's ability to float.

Therefore, the ability to float is the most fundamental characteristic allowing a canoe to be used for its intended purpose.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekozala na litomba mpo na moto oyo azali kokana kosala kaa na motuka na ye?","The correct answer is **A: Bososoli makasi ya oyo mutuka nay o ekoki kosala te**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the difficulties of camping with a car. It states that problems can arise, and sometimes you can't even understand the cause of the issues.  The ultimate point is that while car camping is enjoyable, it's not a foolproof solution to always have a hassle-free experience. ""Bososoli makasi ya oyo mutuka nay o ekoki kosala te"" (Major troubles that your car might have) best reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Motuka oyo epesaka nzela na bakiti ete elala** (A car that provides access to tents and stays): While true, this is a description of a car's purpose, not the problems encountered *while* trying to camp.
* **C: Hema** (Horse): This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **D: Oyo ya motu ye moko wapi kosalala kaa** (Where can the person's own car be parked): This is a logistical question, but the passage focuses on the problems *with the car itself* during camping.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini batu oyo bazali nak aa na mituka bakoki kolinga kokima soki bazali koluka kotikala na nse ya radar?","The correct answer is **A: Kotambwisa motuka ya monene, lokola SUV to minivan**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Camping ya motuka esalemaka soki oza na fourgonnette mingi, SUV moko, berline moko to kopema na bakiti elalisaka.""  This means people who want to camp with their vehicles should use larger vehicles like SUVs, minivans, or vans. This makes them less likely to be detected by radar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kosala mobembo molai koleka na nzela:**  This is about radar detectors, not about the type of vehicle.
* **C: Kobongisa hema na engumba to na esika ya moto ye moko:** This is about jamming signals, which is illegal in many places and not a primary way to avoid radar detection.
* **D: Kozanga koyebana na motuka oyo bazali kosalela:** This is dangerous and illegal.

Therefore, the most logical and directly supported answer is **A**.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani atongaki lisusu Casablanca mbala ya mibale?","The correct answer is **A: Baportuguais (Portuguese)**.

The text states: ""Bato ya Portugal babomaki yango mpe batongaki yango na nkombo ya Casa Branca..."" which translates to ""The Portuguese discovered it and built a fort called Casa Branca...""
"
Nani atikalaki na engumba Casablanca ya mikolo na biso nsima ya likama oyo esalemaki na biloko oyo ezalisama?,"The correct answer is **D: Bphéniciens (Phoenicians)**.

The text states: ""bazalaki kosalela yango na bato ya Phénicie..."" which translates to ""they traded with the Phoenicians..."".  This indicates the Phoenicians were among the earliest inhabitants and traders in Casablanca. The text further mentions Romans, Portuguese, and Spanish, but it explicitly mentions the Phoenicians first in the context of early trade.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini Sintra ayebanaki na bapaya?","The correct answer is **C: Botali malamu ya Lord Byron**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many believe Lord Byron wrote a famous poem about Sintra because of its beauty. The question asks why Sintra is known to visitors. This directly links to the reason mentioned in the text about Byron's poem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Roca:** Cabo da Roca is mentioned as a place the Scotturb 403 bus goes to, not as a primary reason Sintra is known to visitors.
*   **B: Komimonisa ya Maria:**  The Fatima sanctuary is mentioned as a place of great importance related to the Virgin Mary, but not as a reason Sintra is known to visitors.
*   **D: Ezali nsango y abolingo:** While Sintra is beautiful, the text explicitly states Lord Byron's poem was *about* the beauty, indicating the poem itself is the key reason for its fame, not just being a place of love.



"
Nini endimami na Arménie te?,"The correct answer is **A: Etúká ya Nagorno-Karabakh** (The Nagorno-Karabakh region).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na lisungi ya Armenie, basalaki repiblike ya sika. Kasi, eza te ekolo eyebana - ata kutu Armenie - endimaka yango te."" This translates to: ""In the territory of Armenia, a republic was established. However, it is not recognized - not even by Armenia itself."" The ""it"" refers back to the region in question, which is the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Etumba oyo esalemaki na ba Azeris** (The attacks made on the Azeris): While the attacks are part of the larger conflict, the passage focuses on the lack of recognition of the region itself.
*   **C: Baloba ya boyokani ya Azerbaïdjan** (Azerbaijan's calls for peace): The passage doesn't directly discuss Azerbaijan's peace calls.
*   **D: République ya sika** (The republic): The republic is *in* the Nagorno-Karabakh region, but the question asks *why* it's not recognized - and the reason is the region itself.



"
Nini ezali kokoba kozala na bopusi likoló na boyokani kati na Azerbaïdjan mpe Arménie?,"The correct answer is **D: region ya Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the conflict originated over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.  The dispute over the region's status is the root cause of the strained relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba Arménie oyo bafandaka na Azerbaïdjan** (Armenians who live in Azerbaijan): While this is a factor in the broader conflict, it's not the *initial* or central point of contention. The main issue is control over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
* **B: Etumba ya 1994** (The year 1994): 1994 is a *year* when the situation escalated. It's not the underlying issue itself.
* **C: Baloma y aboyokani** (They are increasing the conflict): The passage describes the situation as already being tense and prone to conflict, but it doesn't indicate an *increase* in conflict in the immediate future.  The question asks what is *going to happen* to the conflict, not what is happening *now*. The conflict is a long-standing issue.



Therefore, the Nagorno-Karabakh region is the central issue driving the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
"
"Ntango ozali kozwa taksi na Charlotte, nini ekoki komema na kofuta mbongo mosusu?","The correct answer is **D: Kozala na boninga ya libota (Being aware of the traffic)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mbala mingi, mabota ya Charlotte basalelaka te bataxi, kasi bakoki kozala ntina na bantango mosusu."" (Often, Charlotte taxis are not busy, but they can be busy with people.)
* **It also mentions:** ""Kilo eleki mingi mpo balekisaki bato 2, yango wana liponi wana ekoki kosenga mosolo mingi koleka oyo osengeli kofuta."" (It takes a long time to pick up only 2 people, so this taxi can earn much more.)

These points indicate that traffic conditions significantly impact how quickly a taxi can pick up passengers and, therefore, the amount of time spent waiting.  Being aware of the traffic is the key to understanding why wait times can vary.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kofanda na esika mosusu (Going to a more busy location):** While this *could* help, the passage doesn't directly suggest going to a busier location as the primary factor in wait times. It focuses on the *traffic* in Charlotte.
* **B: Kozala na ba voyageurs misato (Having multiple passengers):**  This is a *result* of good traffic conditions, not the cause of varying wait times. Having multiple passengers makes the ride more profitable, but it doesn't explain why wait times differ.
* **C: Kokende na Uptown (Going to Uptown):** The passage mentions Uptown as an area with high taxi demand, but it doesn't say that *all* trips to Uptown have the same wait time. Traffic in Uptown could be heavy or light.



Therefore, **D: Kozala na boninga ya libota** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the information provided.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kotalelama lokola likambo ya mabe ya kofanda na Charlotte elongo na bana?","The correct answer is **D: Koluka kosepela na engumba (Driving to work)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights these points:

*   **Traffic congestion is a major problem in Charlotte.**  ""Mbala mingi bato ya bisika mosusu batangaka bonkonde ya libota na kati ya makambo etindaka bango na kokende kuna, pe mbala mingi bapaya bamonaka ete engumba wana eza pete na kosepela kuna na bana."" (Often, people traveling to work in the traffic jam are delayed and often realize that the traffic is too bad to go to work.)
*   **Commuting times are long.** ""Kilo eleki mingi mpo balekisaki bato 2, yango wana liponi wana ekoki kosenga mosolo mingi koleka osengeli kofuta."" (It takes a long time to get 2 people, which is why this commute can be much longer than you think.)

These details directly point to driving to work as a significant issue affecting people's lives in Charlotte. The other options are less directly supported by the text.

*   **A: Ntalo ya bandako (Construction)** - While construction might contribute to traffic, the passage emphasizes overall congestion, not just construction.
*   **B: Kozwa taxi (Taking a taxi)** -  The passage says taxis *can* be an option, but doesn't make it the primary concern.
*   **C: Bavandi oyo bautaki na bisika mosusu (People who live in distant areas)** - This is a contributing factor to traffic, but the passage focuses on the *consequences* of traffic (long commutes).



"
"Liboso ete bato ya Espagne báya, nani azalaki kotambwisa eteni ya nɔrdi ya Chili?","The correct answer is **C: Araucanien**.

The passage states: ""Liboso Espagne ekoma na ekeke ya 16, nordi ya Chili ezalaki na nse ya boyangeli ya baInca mpe bana-mboka ya Araucanians (Mapuche) bazalaki kofanda na katikati pe na sudi ya Chili.""  This translates to: ""From the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule and the descendants of Araucanians (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.""
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kati na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalemaki te na 1810?","The correct answer is **C: Bitumba ya Napoléon ezalaki kosalema**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Chile gained independence in 1810 *because* of the Napoleonic Wars.
* The text explicitly says ""Bitumba ya Napoléon oyo etikaki Espagne kozanga boyangeli na eleko ya mwa bambula"" which translates to ""The Napoleonic Wars, which led to Spain's conquest, facilitated Chile's independence.""
* Therefore, the Napoleonic Wars were happening *before* 1810, leading to the opportunity for Chile to seek independence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Guvernema ya kati ezalaki te:** The text doesn't directly say the central government wasn't present.
* **B: Chili elongaki ba Espagnols:** The text states Chile gained independence in 1818, not 1810.
* **D: Chili esakolaki lipanda:** The text says Chile gained independence in 1818.



"
Ndenge nini bato bakoki kokóma na bamboka ya mosika na etúká ya Liguria?,"The correct answer is **B: Na motuka to na engbunduka** (By car or by train).

The passage states: ""Banzela, bingbunduka mpe masuwa esangisaka bamboka..."" which translates to ""Trains, buses, and boats connect the villages..."" Therefore, you can travel to Cinque Terre by either train or bus.
"
Liloba ya Italien ‘Cinque Terre’ ezali kolobela nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Bamboka mitano**.

The text states: ""Cinque Terre, oyo elimbolia Mabele Mitano..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands/Villages...""

Therefore, ""bamboka mitano"" (five lands/villages) is the correct translation of ""Cinque Terre"".
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya botte ebongi mpo na makambo oyo ekoki kogumbama na eleko ya malili?","The correct answer is **B: Sapato na biloko ya sete (boots with a lug sole)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Modele esengeli kozala mozindo, 5 mm (1/5 inch) to mingi, mpe biloko esengeli kozala mwa pete mpona bisika ya malili makasi."" This refers to the sole of the boot needing a tread with lugs for grip on slippery surfaces like ice and snow.  ""Biloko ya sete"" (lug sole) are the type of sole that provide this grip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sapato na talons mike (Low heels):** Heel height isn't the primary concern for grip on slippery surfaces.
* **C: Sapato na talons milayi (High heels):** High heels are *worse* for grip on ice and snow.
* **D: Sapato oyo ezangi ezaleli ya bozindo ya 1/5 pouce (Boots that are not at least 1/5 inch deep):** The text states the tread depth needs to be *at least* 1/5 inch, not that it needs to *be* that deep.  The key is the lugs, not just the overall depth.



"
"Na kati ya biloko yango, oyo wapi ekosalisa te mpo na kobongisa traction na banzela oyo ezali na glace na ntango ya malili?","The correct answer is **C: Zelo (Chlorure de calcium)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mbala mingi, mabanga ya mike to mungwa (chlorure ya calcium) epanzanaka na babalabala to na banzela mpona kobongisa yango.""  This translates to: ""Often, sand or calcium chloride (chlorure ya calcium) is sprinkled on roads or sidewalks to improve them.""  Calcium chloride is a common de-icer used to melt ice and improve traction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gravier (Gravel):** While gravel *can* provide some traction, the text focuses on specific materials used for ice.
* **B: Gravier (Gravel):** Similar to above, gravel is a general term, but calcium chloride is specifically mentioned for icy conditions.
* **D: Mayi (Water):** Water on its own doesn't improve traction on ice; it makes it more slippery.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekokani mpenza na Hawaii mpe Bisanga Cook?","The correct answer is **D: Bango mibale bazali na bingumba te**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ata eza mike, ezokundwela biso bapaya ya mikolo oyo bayaki na Hawaii liboso mboka esalaema, tozalaki te na bahotel ya bapaya pe biloko mosusu ya kitoko."" This translates to: ""Even though it's small, it's appreciated by tourists who have come from Hawaii, we don't have hotels or many other tourist attractions.""

This indicates that the Cook Islands lack hotels and tourist infrastructure, which is a key difference compared to Hawaii, which *does* have a well-developed tourism industry. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola bisanga ya Cook malamu te?","The correct answer is **A: Ezali moke koleka Hawaii**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ata eza mike, ezokundwela biso bapaya ya mikolo oyo bayaki na Hawaii liboso mboka esalaema, tozalaki te na bahotel ya bapaya pe biloko mosusu ya kitoko."" This translates to ""Even though it is small, it is popular with tourists who have come from Hawaii, we don't have hotels or many other attractions.""  This implies that Cook Islands are smaller than Hawaii.
"
"Na kati ya bisika ya babateli zamba oyo elandi, oyo ya wapi epesaka lolenge mibale ya kopona mpo nae sika ya kolala?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text states: ""Sirena eza esika moko pamba oyo babatela zamba oyo ezalaka na bachambre mingi ya kolala pe bilei ya moto pene ya ba camping."" This translates to ""Sirena is a single place that caters to the people who camp and the people who are near the camping area.""  The other options (Los Patos, La Leona, San Pedrillo) are mentioned as camping locations *without* the same description of offering accommodation."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi okoki kobomba mokanda ya ndingisa ya parke soki olingi kosalela mbongo na esika ya kodefisa mbongo?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Okoki kozwa ndingisa ya kokota na parke mbala moko na station Ranger na Puerto Jiménez..."" (You can get a park entrance permit once at the Ranger Station in Puerto Jiménez...).

The question asks where you can get the park entrance permit.  Puerto Jiménez is explicitly mentioned as a location for obtaining the permit.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya kosala ski esalemaka na bisika oyo ezali na nse mingi?","The correct answer is **C: Ndenge ya ngomba Alpe**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes different types of skiing, including ""ski ya fond"" (cross-country skiing) and downhill skiing.
* It mentions that downhill skiing is often done on slopes (a ""nse mingi"" in Lingala).
* ""Ndenge ya ngomba Alpe"" translates to ""Alpine skiing,"" which is the most common type of downhill skiing done on mountain slopes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosala ba-ski (Skiing):** This is too general. The question asks about the *specific style* of skiing on steep slopes.
* **B: Ski na nsima ya mboka (Skiing on the snow):**  While technically true, it doesn't specify the type of skiing or the slope.
* **D: Kokende na mokongo na nzela ya ski (Going fast on skis):** This describes the result of skiing, not the technique on a steep slope.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kosalisa bato oyo basalaka ski ya fond, mpe balingi kozala na mbangu koleka?","The correct answer is **B: Saki ya kilo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...soki makambo eza malamu, okozala na bavitese ya ski ya makasi kozanga saki ya kilo na banzela babongisa."" This translates to: ""...if things are easy, having very fast skis can result in a weight of a kilogram on the binding.""  This implies that a heavier ski setup would allow for faster speeds, which is what someone wanting more speed would want.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sapato ya makasi koleka (Heavier boots):** While heavier boots might add some stability, they don't directly contribute to increased speed.
* **C: Ndenge ya malamu (Soft technique):**  A soft technique might make skiing easier, but it wouldn't necessarily result in higher speeds.
* **D: Nzela oyo ebongisami malamu (A simple method):**  A simple method doesn't inherently lead to faster speeds.



"
Batu ya kosala mobembo oyo bazuaki choc ya kokota lisusu bazali na ntango Makasi kosala nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Komesana na mimeseno ya esika ya sika** (Communicate with the sick relatives).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""ntango ozonga na mboka na yo nsima ya kofanda na mokili mosusu, osengeli komesana na bizaleli ya sika po obungisa bizaleli na yo mosusu ya mimeseno ya mboka na yo."" (When you leave the sick, you must communicate with the sick relatives to reconcile with your own feelings about the illness.)

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Kozala na motema molai mpe kososola** (Be very sad and grieve) - While sadness is natural, the text focuses on communication, not just grieving.
* **C: Kosala mibembo na mboka mopaya** (Perform rituals at the sick person's home) - The text is about communication, not rituals.
* **D: Kozongela komesana na mimeseno na bango ya ndako** (Arrange to meet with relatives at home) - The text emphasizes communicating with the *sick* relatives, not just any relatives at home.



"
Nakotala makomi oyo eleki kobanga ya kozonga na ndako ekoki kozala mpasi mingi mingi mpo na lolenge nini ya mobembo?,"The correct answer is **B: Bato oyo basalaka mibembo oyo bamesanaki nokinoki ntango bazalaki kofanda na mboka mopaya.**

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes that people who engage in sexual activity (especially when it's frequent or occurs in unsafe environments) are more likely to contract sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The text directly links sexual activity and risky behavior to the risk of STIs. Option B directly reflects this link.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batu ya kosala mobembo oyo bakutanaki na choc ya bonkoko mabe** - The text doesn't mention chickenpox or a connection to STIs.
*   **C: Batu ya kosala mobembo oyo bazali kaka na ntango ya komisepelisa nsima ya libala** - The text talks about sexual *activity*, not just contraception.
*   **D: Bato oyo basalaka mibembo oyo bazali na motema molai mingi te** - While risky behavior increases STI risk, the text doesn't specifically state that *only* people with risky behavior get STIs. It's the combination of sexual activity *and* risky behavior that is the key factor.

Therefore, option B is the only one that aligns with the information presented in the text.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi bato basengeli koboya kosala na moose?","The correct answer is **C: Kozongisa nan se nivo ya likama na bango oyo ekoki kozala** (To regulate the level of fear in them).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nyama ebengami elan (eyebani pe na nkombo ya elk) ebundisaka mpenza te, kasi bamibatelaka soki bamoni eloko oyo ezobangisa. Soki bato bazomona te nyama ebengami elan lokola likama, bakoki kopusana mpenza pene na yango mpe komitia na likama."" (The eland antelope is not very aggressive, but it runs away when it sees something that scares it. If people don't see the eland antelope as a threat, they can be very aggressive towards it and attack it.)

* **The core issue is fear:** The eland antelope runs away *because* it's scared. People become aggressive *because* they perceive it as a threat.

* **Option C directly addresses the solution:** By regulating the level of fear in people (e.g., educating them about the antelope's behavior, showing them it's not dangerous), the aggression can be reduced.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kokip ate na kozala na bango (To approach and be with them):**  Approaching a potentially fearful animal could *increase* its fear and aggression.
* **B: Kopusana penepene na malembe mingi (To aggressively confront them frequently):** This would likely escalate the conflict and make the animal even more defensive.
* **D: Kotala bango na mosika (To look at them indifferently):** This ignores the animal's fear response and doesn't address the root cause of the problem.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical and effective approach based on the passage's description.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi oyo etali elan, oyo wapi ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **B: Ntango mosusu batalelaka yango te lokola likama oyo ekoki kozala** (Usually, we don't consider it a food that can be eaten).

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Nyama ebengami elan (eyebani pe na nkombo ya elk) ebundisaka mpenza te, kasi bamibatelaka soki bamoni eloko oyo ezobangisa."" (Elan meat (from a zebra or elk) is not very tasty, but people eat it if they see what it's used for.)
* **The question then asks:** ""Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi oyo etali elan, oyo wapi ezali solo te?"" (I've seen these things happen, and the explanation is that it's elan, where is that not true?)

The key here is that elan meat isn't typically eaten *unless* there's a reason. Options A, C, and D all suggest scenarios where elan meat *is* eaten. Option B accurately reflects the premise that elan isn't usually considered a food source and is only consumed when necessary or for a specific purpose.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala likama mingi te mpo na moto oyo azali kosala mobembo na esobe?","The correct answer is **A: Kozanga bilamba ya molunge na butu ya malili**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Na mokolo ya moi makasi, bato bazosala mobembo bakoki komona bisika oyo ekoki kokosa bango neti eza mai (to biloko mosusu).  Ekoki kozala likama soki moto azosala mobembo alandi eloko ekosi ye, mpe abebisi nguya ya ntina mpe mai oyo etikali. Ata bisobe ya molunge makasi ekoki kokoma malili mingi na butu. Okoki kobela maladi ya malili makasi soki olati bilamba ya kopesa yo molunge te.""

* **Translation (approximate):** ""On a very hot day, people can hallucinate seeing water (or other things). It can be a trap if someone who is hallucinating walks towards the perceived water and tries to drink it, and the water is not real. Even a small mirage can cause a lot of harm in the heat. You can even die from thirst if you don't heed the advice to get water.""

* **Analysis of Options:**
    * **A: Kozanga bilamba ya molunge na butu ya malili (Ignoring hallucinations due to heat):**  The text emphasizes the danger of *acting on* hallucinations caused by heat.  The most crucial advice is to *not* follow the hallucination.
    * **B: Komona mirage oyo epesaka illusion ya mayi (Seeing a mirage that creates the illusion of water):** This is simply *observing* the mirage, not addressing the danger.
    * **C: Kobebisa nguya ntango ozali kolanda mirage (Trying to get water when you are following a mirage):** This is the *dangerous action* described in the text.
    * **D: Kobebisa mayi ntango ozali kolanda mirage (Drinking water when you are following a mirage):** This is also the dangerous action and the mirage is not real water.

Therefore, the best answer is **A** because the text stresses the importance of ignoring the hallucination itself, driven by the heat.  The core message is not to *see* the mirage, but to *not act on* it.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te ete ekoki kozala likama mpo na bato oyo basalaka mibembo na esobe?","The correct answer is **C: Hypothermie**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how prolonged exposure to water, especially cold water, can be extremely dangerous and even fatal.** It mentions that even slight chilling can cause significant damage.
* **Hypothermie is the medical term for dangerously low body temperature.** This is a direct consequence of prolonged exposure to cold water and is a serious risk for swimmers, even experienced ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kozanga mayi (Swimming):** Swimming itself isn't the danger; it's the combination of swimming *in cold water* for extended periods.
* **B: Makanisi (A lifeguard):** A lifeguard can *help* in a situation, but they don't *cause* the danger.
* **D: Kozika na moyi (Drowning):** While drowning is a serious risk, the passage specifically highlights the danger of *hypothermie* even without drowning.  A person could be struggling but not drown immediately and still succumb to hypothermie.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, batu ya etuluku nini bazuaki makambo mingi koleka nsima ya kokoma ya batu ya kosala bolukiluki?","The correct answer is **C: Tainos**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the Taínos as the original inhabitants of the Dominican Republic before the arrival of Europeans. It states that they were decimated by the Spanish due to disease and forced labor. The question asks who suffered greatly as a result of colonization.  The passage specifically mentions the Taínos being reduced to around 100,000 people by the early 16th century.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, monoko nini bato ya Caraïbes bazalaki koloba?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The text states: ""Caribes ezalaki mboka ya bato oyo balobaka lokota ya Arawakan oyo bayaki wana pene ya mobu 10 000 liboso ya ntango na biso."" This means the indigenous people of the Caribbean who lived there for over 10,000 years spoke the Arawakan language.
"
Nani bakoki koloba ete akómisaki bato mingi kosala ski lokola mosala ya kominanola?,"The correct answer is **A: Bato ya mobulu na ski (People who love to ski)**.

The text states: ""Ski eza mosala monene ya mobembo oyo bato mingi balingaka..."" which translates to ""Ski is a very popular hobby that many people love..."" This directly indicates that people who enjoy skiing are those who engage in it as a leisure activity. While Norwegians and Australians were involved in the formalization of skiing, the core of it being a popular hobby is about people who *love* to ski.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, pene na ngonga nini lisano ya ski eyebanaki mpo na mbala ya liboso lokola lisano?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 BC**.

The text states: ""Mayemi ya mabulu oyo eza na bato bazosala ski ebanda banda na 5000 liboso ya ntango na biso!"" which translates to ""The origins of skiing go back 5000 years ago!"".

While the other options mention important milestones (1861 for the first international ski team, 17th century for alpine skiing), the question asks about *when* skiing was first established as a sport.  The text clearly indicates it began 5000 BC.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esanganaka mingimingi na esanga oyo eleki monene oyo ezali pembenipembeni ya libongo ya est ya afrique?","The correct answer is **A: influence européenne (European influence)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that European exploration and colonization began around the 15th century, with Vasco da Gama finding a sea route to India. This marked a significant and lasting influence on the region.
* While the other options are present, the text focuses on the *arrival* of Europeans as a pivotal event.
* The text mentions Islamic influence and African Bantu peoples, but those predate the 15th century European arrival and aren't described as the *most* significant influence in the context of the provided text.
* ""Esika ya kitoko mpenza ya opema"" (the beautiful land of dream) is a metaphorical description and not a primary influence.



Therefore, the arrival and subsequent influence of European powers is the most emphasized and arguably the most significant factor mentioned in the passage concerning the region."
Nini ezali ezaleli ya bisanga mikemike te na Afrika ya est? ,"The correct answer is **D: Lipanda na bikolo mosusu** (Plants and a lot of wildlife).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bisanga ebele ya mike ezalaka bikolo ezwa lipanda, to ezalaki na boyokani na France, pe eyebani na nkombo ya mabongo ya motuya.""  This translates to: ""Many small islands are made of volcanic rock, or are under French control, and have been affected by the elephant ivory trade.""  The key phrase is ""bikolo ezwa lipanda"" which means ""volcanic rock"" and implies abundant plant life and a natural environment supporting wildlife.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Boyokani na France (Under French control):** While some islands are under French control, this isn't the defining characteristic of *all* the islands.
* **B: Bisika mingi kitoko mpenza ya kopema (Many large areas of copying):** This doesn't align with the description of the islands. The text emphasizes their volcanic nature.
* **C: Lokumu mpo na banyama ya zamba (A haven for wild animals):** While some islands may have wildlife, the text focuses on their geological origin and the impact of the ivory trade, not primarily on being a haven for animals.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini Pasika esalemaka na mangomba mosusu mingimingi ya bonkoko?","The correct answer is **B: Koyamba butu ya bokengeli na mokolo ya Mposo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that many Christians celebrate Easter on the day after the resurrection of Christ (the Sunday following).
* Option B directly reflects this tradition of celebrating the resurrection of Christ on Easter Sunday.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosala molulu ya kobota (Making a big feast):** While Easter *can* involve feasts, the passage doesn't specifically highlight feasts as the primary reason for its popularity.
* **C: Kosala feti ya printemps mpo na lisanga (Having a big spring celebration for joy):** The passage mentions Easter *can* coincide with spring, but it's not the main reason for its popularity.
* **D: Kotala ndenge moyi ezali kobima (Watching how life is emerging):** This is a very general statement and not specific to the religious significance or cultural traditions surrounding Easter.



"
"Mpo na koboya masengami mosusu ntango azali kokota na Équateur, mwana mboka ya Cuba asengeli liboso kozala na nini?","The correct answer is **B: Mokanda ya libyangi oyo epesameli mibeko (Passport that issues permits)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Cuban citizens need a passport valid for at least 6 months beyond their intended stay in Ecuador. 
* A passport *is* the document that proves identity and allows travel, essentially providing the necessary permits to enter a country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Passeport oyo ezali na mosala mpo na sanza 6 koleka mikolo ya mobembo (Passport that is valid for 6 months beyond the date of birth):** While passport validity is important, the text specifies *beyond the date of birth* not just 6 months beyond arrival. The essential point is that the passport must be valid and allow travel.
* **C: Ticket ya kokende mpe kozonga mpo na kolakisa bolai ya kofanda (Ticket to go and come back for money):**  This is just a travel ticket and doesn't provide the necessary documentation for entry and legal stay.
* **D: Carte verte ya États-Unis (US Green Card):** A Green Card is a permanent residency document in the US and doesn't grant entry into Ecuador.



"
Masengami ya mobembo ya Équateur ebongisami mpo na nini te?,"The correct answer is **C: Kondimisa bolai ya kofanda ya motu oyo asali mobembo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Babimisaki masengami wana mpona bato ya mikili wana mibale batombola ndenge ebongi kozaga mobulu.""  This translates to ""They are issuing these documents so that those people can have a way to leave.""  The purpose of issuing these documents is to facilitate their departure (bolai ya kofanda) from Ecuador.  This is directly linked to the reason for the visa requirements mentioned earlier.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobatela motongo ya bato oyo basalaka mibembo mingi te** (To appease the anger of people who commit many crimes): The passage doesn't mention crime or anger.
* **B: Kobatela ndenge ya batu ya kokota oyo ebongisami** (To appease the way of the people who are being sent): The passage refers to documents being issued to *facilitate their departure*, not to appease them.
* **D: Koyeba mpenza ntango passeport etikali kosala** (To know where the passport is being used): While the passage mentions passport requirements, it doesn't state the reason for issuing documents is to track passport usage.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kosenga mbongo mingi na mboka mopaya koleka na ndako?","The correct answer is **A: Kotala miso miso (Getting a medical examination)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kanisa kosala ekzame ya miso na ndako, mingimingi soki ekofutama na assurance, mpe komema ordonance mpona kotika yango esika mosusu."" This translates to: ""Go for a medical examination, especially if there's an assurance, and get a prescription to treat it further.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Montures ya likolo (Glasses):** Glasses are for vision problems, not the condition described in the text.
* **C: Assurance ya miso (Medical insurance):** While helpful for paying for treatment, insurance doesn't *treat* the condition.
* **D: Montures oyo ezali na nkombo te (Glasses that are not prescription):** This is irrelevant to the condition being discussed.

Therefore, the only option that aligns with the information provided is getting a medical examination.
"
Nini ekoki kozala likama oyo ekoki kobima soki ozali kosomba ba cadres ya lokumu na mboka mopaya?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekoki kozala ya malamu (It can be serious)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that serious conditions can develop from using tainted beauty products.** It specifically mentions that even if you feel assured, you should get a medical examination and prescription.  It warns that the effects can be much more severe than those experienced at home.
* **A:** While a re-examination is recommended, it doesn't address the *potential severity* of the problem.
* **B:** The passage explicitly says that an order isn't always the solution. It recommends medical attention, not simply a prescription.
* **D:** The passage *does* say assurance isn't enough, but it doesn't directly state that insurance can't cover the damage. The main point is the severity of the condition.

Therefore, the most accurate and directly supported answer is that the condition can be serious.

"Na oyo etali kosalela mbongo na Malouines, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali solo?","The correct answer is **D: Longola mbongo ya Falkland, mbala mingi livre ya Angleterre ezali mbongo oyo endimami mingi** (Withdraw money from the Falklands, the British pound is often the most accepted currency).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...mbala mingi bandimaka badolare ya Etats-Unis. Na bisanga ya mosika, mbala mosusu bandimaka mpenza te bakarte ya niongo, atako bakoki kozwa mbongo ya Grande Bretagne na ya Etats-Unis; luka koyeba yango epai ya bakolo esika mpona koyeba nini eza lolenge malamu ya kofuta mbongo. **Eza mpenza mpasi na kobongola mbongo ya Malouines na libanda ya bisanga wana, yango wana bongola mbongo liboso ya kolongwa na bisanga wana.**""  This means the Stanley bank is the primary place to withdraw money.
* **The text also says:** ""...na bisanga ya mosika, mbala mosusu bandimaka badolare ya Etats-Unis. **Longola mbongo ya Falkland, mbala mingi livre ya Angleterre ezali mbongo oyo endimami mingi**"" which directly indicates that the British pound is widely accepted.
* **Option A is incorrect:** While cards and pounds are used, it doesn't represent the *primary* location for withdrawals.
* **Option B is incorrect:** Stanley isn't *only* a place to exchange dollars.
* **Option C is incorrect:** While you *can* exchange Falkland money, the text emphasizes withdrawing from the bank.



Therefore, option D best reflects the information provided in the text.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango ozali kosala mobembo wuta États-Unis kino Malouines, wapi lolenge mosusu ya kofuta longola kaka karte ya kredi ekoki kozala na ntina mingi?","The correct answer is **B: Na bisanga nionso**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bandimaka livres sterling na bisika nyonso na bisanga wana..."" which translates to ""I can pay in pounds sterling at any bank in that bank..."".  It also mentions using US dollars and credit cards.  This indicates that payment is possible at all locations of the bank.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na magasin ya FIC West:** While the initial situation mentions FIC West store, the text indicates payment is possible at the bank's *banks* and not just that one store.
* **C: Na bisanga ya libanda:** This is too broad. The question is asking about payment options at a *specific* bank in the Falkland Islands.
* **D: Na Stanley mobimba:** While Stanley is the main town, the text doesn't specify that payment is only available in Stanley. It says the bank is located *in* Stanley, but doesn't restrict payment to that location.



"
Likambo nini ezali na boyokani te na fɛti ya bafɛti ya tempelo?,"The correct answer is **A: Mbotama ya nzoku (The performance of the orchestra)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a temple festival involving a specific type of musical performance (batempelo).  It emphasizes the orchestra as a key element of the celebration.  The question asks what is *not* typically part of the festival.

* **Mbotama ya tempelo (Temple rituals):**  The passage explicitly mentions temple rituals as a reason for the festival (temple anniversary, etc.).
* **Mbotama ya nzambe (Divine worship):** The passage mentions the festival being held in honor of a deity, indicating a religious element.
* **Makambo minene oyo etali tempelo (Large temple structures):** While the temple itself is the central location, the passage focuses on the *festival activities* surrounding the temple, not the building itself.
* **Mbotama ya nzoku (The performance of the orchestra):** The passage states that the festival includes ""orchestre ya tempelo"" but doesn't suggest that the *performance* of the orchestra is something *not* included. It's a core part of the celebration.



Therefore, the performance of the orchestra is the most likely thing that wouldn't be considered a core, defining element of the *festival itself* compared to the religious and ritual aspects.



"
Epai wapi tokoki komona banzoku oyo ba decorer?,"The correct answer is **A: Bisika nyonso kobanda na suka ya sanza ya zomi na moko kino na katikati ya sanza ya mitano**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Batempelo ebele ya tempelo basalaka yango na fete oyo basalaka mbala moko na mbula banda na suka ya sanza ya zomi na moko kino na katikati ya sanza ya mitano..."" which translates to ""Many temples celebrate it once a year by decorating with a mixture of sandalwood paste in the center of a five-tiered tower...""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na batempelo** (At temples) - While temples are where the celebration happens, the question asks *where to see the decorations*.
* **C: Namilulu na feti ya tempelo** (In the midst of the temple festival) - This is too general. The decorations are a specific part of the festival, not just ""in the midst of it.""
* **D: Na balabala ya Kerala** (In the Kerala dancers) - Kerala dancers are part of the festival, but not the primary place to observe the sandalwood paste decorations.

Here's why:

* **The problem:** The passage highlights the expense of traditional presentations (projectors, etc.) and the cost of hiring companies.
* **Option A directly addresses this:** Using a projector is a more cost-effective way to display information, especially for regular presentations. It avoids the need for frequent rentals or company fees.
* **Why the other options are less suitable:**
    * **B: Kozua esika ya liboso olie ya mombongo (Renting a portable screen for the classroom):** While better than nothing, it still involves rental fees.
    * **C: Zua esika liboso na mpepo oyo ezali ya mbala moko te (Using a portable screen with a one-time rental):**  This is similar to option B and still incurs costs. The passage emphasizes avoiding *recurring* costs.
    * **D: Koluka kokitisa ntalo (Turning off the lights):** This is irrelevant to the presentation problem.

Therefore, using a projector is the most cost-effective solution presented in the options, aligning with the passage's main argument.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekozala kolekisa ntango mpamba mpo na koluka ntango ozali kozua esika na mpepo ya bakelasi mosusu ya ntalo?","The correct answer is **C: Kokitisa ntalo (Decentralization)**.

Here's why:

The text describes the problems with centralized learning (like traditional classrooms or corporate training). It mentions:

* **Cost:** It's expensive to train everyone in a single location.
* **Inefficiency:**  People spend a lot of time traveling to a central location.
* **Limited accessibility:**  Centralized models don't work well for people in different locations.

Decentralization, which is the spread of learning opportunities to various locations, directly addresses these issues.  It allows for learning to happen closer to where people live and work, reducing costs and improving access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: BMpepo ya mbala moko (One-time Corporate Training):** This is the problem the text is describing, not the solution.
* **B: Esika ya mombongo (School Location):**  While schools are a location, the text is critiquing the *centralized nature* of school learning.
* **D: Esika ya liboso (Public Location):** Similar to B, this refers to a location but doesn't address the core issue of centralization.



"
Nini esengeli te kobakisa na kati ntango ozali kokokanisa devis ya tarif total na Afrika na tarif ya mokili mobimba?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntalo ya visa na Afrique**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Kobosana te kobakisa mosolo ya likolo mpona ba viza..."" which translates to ""There is no need to pay for a visa in order to...""  This directly links visa costs as a factor in the total fare difference between African and European flights.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ntalo ya ba visas ya kobakisa mpo na bisika ezali libanda ya Afrika** (Cost of transit visas for destinations in Africa): While transit visas can be a factor, the passage focuses on the general cost of visas *to enter* African countries.
* **B: Ntalo ya palata ntango ya kobima na Afrique** (Cost of boarding in Africa): The passage doesn't mention boarding costs being different.
* **D: Ntalo ya transport na mabele mpo na bisika oyo ezali libanda ya Afrika** (Cost of transportation by land for destinations in Africa):  This option is irrelevant as the question is about airfare and the passage focuses on airlines.



"
"Na kotalela makomi oyo eleki, bazando ya minene babandi kopesa koleka na lolenge ndenge na ndenge?","The correct answer is **B: Ba foure ya micro-ondes** (Microwave ovens).

Here's why:

The passage states that many people cook with microwave ovens (foure ya micro-ondes) when they want to cook quickly.  It also mentions that often, people buy ready-made meals, which are often pre-cooked in microwaves.  This directly links microwave ovens to the convenience and speed people seek.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Bilei oyo esili kobongisama (Pre-cooked meals):** While the passage mentions ready-made meals, it doesn't say *how* they are cooked. It only states people buy them.
* **C: Ndako ya kolia na esika yango (The place where it's cooked):** This is too general. While cooking happens somewhere, it doesn't explain the *method* people are using for quick cooking.
* **D: Ntalo kitoko (One time):** This refers to frequency, not the method of cooking.
"
Biloko nini ya malamu oyo bamagazini mosusu ya minene epesaka ekoki kosepelisa kiliya oyo azali kosomba bilei oyo esili kobongisama?,"The answer is **C: Bilei ya mbindo (Cake flour)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that when making cakes, people often use cake flour because it results in a lighter, more tender texture.  The question asks what the ingredients in store-bought cake mixes usually contain to achieve this texture.  Cake flour is a key ingredient that contributes to the characteristic softness and light crumb of a cake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndako ya kolia na esika yango (The place where it's cooled)**: Cooling is important, but it doesn't determine the *texture* of the cake batter itself.
* **B: Mpo na oyo ekeseni mingi te (Because it's not very expensive)**: Cost is a factor in *buying* a mix, not in the ingredients *within* the mix that create the texture.
* **D: four à micro-ondes moko (Only one microwave)**: Microwave ovens aren't relevant to the ingredients in a cake mix.



Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kososolama te na bato ya Belgique mpe ya Suisse oyo balobaka Francais?","The best answer is **C: Ndenge ya kobenga maloba mosusu ya français (The way of expressing French)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that the difference in understanding stems from the *way* people speak French in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France.**  It explicitly states that the nuances of expression and how they communicate are different, leading to potential misunderstandings.
* The passage mentions that people in Belgium and Switzerland are taught French in school, which creates a common base, but their conversational style differs.
* Options A, B, and D are less directly supported by the passage:
    * **A: Système ya kokoma motango ya français ndenge esengeli (The correct system of forming French sentences):** While grammatical accuracy is important, the passage focuses more on conversational nuances than fundamental grammar.
    * **B: Maloba ya français ya kokamwa (The comprehension of French):**  The passage says they *can* understand, but the difficulty lies in the subtleties of expression.
    * **D: Bato balobaka français mingi na France (People who speak French a lot in France):** The passage doesn't compare the quantity of French spoken in France to Belgium/Switzerland; it compares the *style* of speaking.



Therefore, **C** most accurately captures the core issue described in the passage."
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ndenge moko te na France na oyo ezali na Belgique to na Suisse?","The correct answer is **D: Ndenge ya kokoma ba mots mosusu ya français (The way of pronouncing different types of French)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is *not* the same in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France. The passage explicitly states that the pronunciation (ndenge ya kokoma) is different. The passage highlights that the way people pronounce French in Belgium and Switzerland is not the same as in France. The other options are not directly addressed or contradicted by the text:

*   **A: Ndenge ya kobenga maloba nionso (The way of expressing all language)** - While there might be slight differences in expression, the passage focuses on pronunciation.
*   **B: Système ya motango (The education system)** - The passage mentions that many French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland were educated in French, but it doesn't compare the education system directly to France.
*   **C: Français ya solo eteyamaka na biteyelo (French that is only taught in schools)** - The passage implies that the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is learned in school, however it does not say it is *only* taught in schools.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **D**.

Na likambo nini mbala mosusu bakopesa yo mbongo ya mobembo mpo na liwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Soki omeki kozua esika mbala moko na kopanyi ya mpepo na olie ya mosala ya eteni ya misato.**

Here's why:

The prompt states: ""Na bandakisa nyonso, osengeli kokanga esika mbala moko na kompani na nzela ya telefone na yo.""  This means you must call the airline *once*.

The question asks when you are *most likely* to receive a meal voucher. The answer is related to a single call.  Calling the airline *once* is what would trigger the possibility of a meal voucher being offered, *especially* if the flight is long.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Soki ozali kopumbwa na mpepo WestJet** - While possible, the prompt doesn't specifically tie WestJet to automatic meal vouchers.
*   **C: Soki ozali kosala mpepo Lufthansa kouta Paris ti na Etats-Unis** - This is a specific route, not a general condition for receiving a voucher.
*   **D: Soki ozali kopumbwa Delta** - Similar to WestJet, it's possible but not explicitly stated.

The key is the single call, making option B the most logical. A longer flight with a single phone call is a prime scenario for an airline to offer a meal voucher to appease a passenger.

Nini ezali solo na ntina na mbongo ya mobembo mpo na liwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Esengeli kosala réservation mbala moko na site internet ya kopanyi ya mpepona nzela ya téléphone.**

Here's why:

The prompt states: ""Na bandakisa nyonso, osengeli kokanga esika mbala moko na kompani na nzela ya telefone na yo."" This translates to ""In all cases, you must book at least once by phone with the company.""

Option D directly reflects this requirement, stating you need to make a booking either through the company's website *or* by phone.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bazali kofuta mbongo ya mobembo ya matanga** (They are collecting animal quarantine forms): While likely a requirement, the prompt doesn't mention this specifically.
*   **B: Esengeli kosala réservation mbala moko na site internet ya kopanyi ya mpepo** (You must make a reservation once on the airline's website): The prompt explicitly states you *can* book by phone as well.
*   **C: Bazali kofuta mbongo ya mobembo na miniti ya nsuka** (They are collecting quarantine forms in the last minute): The prompt doesn't mention a last-minute requirement.

Ntango nini kosalela aparɛyi ya GPS oyo ezali yango moko ekozala malamu koleka programɛ ya kosala na nzela ya GPS?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntango oyebi mpenza ete okozala na ndenge ya kozua nsango (When you know you are in a no-signal area)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states that a standalone GPS device (GPS oyo esalaka yango moko) is more reliable when you *know* you're in an area with no signal.**  The text explicitly says it's useful ""soki oza te na basango oyo eza connecte na telefone na yo, to soki eza mosika"" (if you don't have phones connected to your phone, or if it's unavailable). This means it's a better backup or primary solution when cellular signals are weak or absent.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ntango ozali koluka kobomba mbongo (When you are looking for a bargain):**  While cost is a factor, reliability is the core reason for choosing a standalone GPS.
* **C: Ntango ozali kokende libanda ya portée (When you are going to a range):** Going to a range *increases* the likelihood of being *without* a signal, making a standalone GPS even *more* desirable. It's not the reason it's better.
* **D: Ntango olingi ko louer appareil te (When you want to rent a device):** Renting doesn't relate to the functionality or reliability of a GPS device.

Nini ezali ntina malamu te ya kosalela appli ya navigation GPS na bokeseni na aparɛyi oyo ezali yango moko?,"The correct answer is **D: Kozala na mposa ya kosomba bacarte ya sika te** (Not having offline map data).

Here's why:

The question states that GPS navigation apps rely on maps. If you don't have the map data downloaded (offline maps), the app can't function properly without an internet connection.  The other options aren't the primary reasons an app wouldn't work on a device without internet:

* **A: Esengeli te komitungisa mpo na ndenge ya kozua nsango** (It's necessary to connect to the internet for a connection): While often true, the question specifically asks about *offline* use.  Some GPS apps allow offline navigation with pre-downloaded maps.
* **B: kobomba mbongo** (Downloading data): Downloading data is *necessary* to use the app, but the question is about why it *won't work* without internet *at all*.  You need internet to download the data initially.
* **C: Kokima bisika ya kofutela** (Tracking your location): The GPS functionality itself *can* work without internet, but the maps and routing *require* internet (unless offline maps are used).



Therefore, the lack of offline maps is the main impediment to using a GPS navigation app on a device without internet.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini okoki kopesa ndanga ete bakokanisa yo na masuwa oyo ebongi?","The correct answer is **C: Réservation na motu oyo ayebi mpenza mobembo Galapagos.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Luka koyeba soki mosali oyo ozokanga esika epai na ye aza moto ayebi malamu Galapagos mpe aza na boyebi mingi ya bololenge ekeseni ya masuwa.""  This translates to: ""To find out where to go, you should contact someone who knows the Galapagos well and has a deep understanding of the island's wildlife.""

Option C directly reflects this advice.  The other options are either too general or not specifically related to getting information about wildlife viewing.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalelamaka te lokola mayele mpo na kobatela bapaya bábɛta masano ya mbongo?","The correct answer is **C: Masanga ya ofele (Gambling addiction)**.

Here's why:

* The prompt describes how casinos use various tactics (noise, lights, attractive decorations) to entice people to gamble. 
* It then states that gambling addiction is a serious issue, and people who understand the addictive nature of gambling are aware of its dangers.
* Therefore, the question asks what *doesn't* work to trap people into gambling. Options A, B, and D all describe things casinos *do* to lure people in. 
* **Masanga ya ofele (Gambling addiction)** is the opposite – it's the awareness of the danger and the fight *against* being trapped by gambling.

So, the question is asking what combats the very thing the casinos are trying to create: a gambling addiction."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mosani ya masano ya mbongo ya mayele asengeli kokima nini?","The correct answer is **C: Kotala ba horloges to ba montres (Install clocks or watches)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how casinos use various tactics (lights, sounds, colors) to disorient players and make them lose track of time. The core problem is that players don't have a clear sense of how long they've been playing. 

The question asks what the ""mechanism of the science of addiction"" needs to be *harnessed* or *utilized* to counter this.  Installing clocks or watches directly addresses the issue of time perception – providing players with a readily available external reference point for time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komela masanga mingi (Prevent more gambling):** While preventing more gambling is the ultimate goal, it doesn't address the immediate problem of players losing track of time and making impulsive decisions.
* **B: Kondima ba incentives nionso (Eliminate all incentives):** Eliminating incentives is a drastic and unrealistic approach. Casinos thrive on incentives.
* **D: Kotuna na ntina ya esika ya kobima oyo ezali penepene (Focus on the specific location where the gambling is happening):** While location matters, the core issue isn't the location itself, but the psychological manipulation happening *within* the location.

Therefore, providing a clear sense of time through clocks or watches directly combats the casino's tactics and helps players regain control.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eteni nini ya elobeli ekomami na makomi minene na katikati ya phrase?","The correct answer is **B: Bankombo**.

Here's why:

* **The question describes a problem with capitalization in bankombo (text).** Specifically, it mentions capitalization happening in the middle of phrases, which is a characteristic of **bankombo**.
* **The passage explicitly states ""Bankombo nyonso, ata pe ya liloba Sie mpona yo, ebandaka na majuscule...""** This directly links the capitalization issue to bankombo itself.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **Bverbes (Verbs):** While verbs are important, the problem isn't specifically about verbs.
    * **Baadjectifs (Adjectives):** Adjectives are descriptive words and their capitalization isn't the primary issue described.
    * **Ba-adverbes (Adverbs):** Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Their capitalization isn't the focus.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekokaki kosala ete kokoma bankombo na makomi minene ezala mpasi mingi?","The correct answer is **B: Kokesenisa kati na baverbe**.

Here's why:

* The problem states that the bankombo (likely referring to a verb conjugator or similar tool) capitalizes words, even in the middle of a phrase. This is a sign of confusion between verbs and other words.
* The problem also mentions that it's difficult to determine if a word is a verb or an adjective.
* The core issue causing this problem is **mixing up verbs and other word types**, particularly through incorrect capitalization. This means the tool struggles with the **coordination (kokesenisa)** between different word classes, specifically verbs.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kotanga (Finding out/Determining):**  While the tool *prevents* determining the correct word type, the *reason* for the error is the difficulty in separating verb types.
* **C: kokoma (To be/To stay):** This is a general verb and not the specific issue.
* **D: Kokesenisa kati na biloko (Coordinating between things/Nouns):**  While coordination of nouns can be tricky, the main problem described is specifically with verbs and their correct usage.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B: Kokesenisa kati na baverbe**."
"Na bamboka ya Malaisie, geste nini elimboli “koya likolo”?","The correct answer is **B: Koningisa loboko** (Raising the hand).

The text states: ""Na Malaisie, ata na kati ya bato ya Malaisie oyo bafandaka na bamboka, elimboli """"yaka,"""" ndenge moko na bilembo ya misapi basali ezotala ndambo ya nzoto, elembo oyo basaleka na mikili mosusu ya poto, pe basengeli kosalela yango kaka na ntina wana.""  This translates to: ""In Malaysia, even among Malaysian people who shake hands, the gesture """"yaka"""" (which means ""raise"") is seen as a sign of respect, a gesture they perform with a raised hand, and they must keep it raised for a long time.""  

Therefore, ""yaka"" means to raise the hand, which is the same as ""koningisa loboko.""
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, geste nini ekoki kolimbola “kozonga”?","The correct answer is **C: Koningisa na loboko na loboko etali libanda (Placing hand on hand)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how in some cultures (like Bamboka), a specific hand gesture (""boni"") signifies ""seeing."" However, in Malaysia, a similar gesture (""yaka"") is associated with ""waiting"" or ""keeping a lookout."" The text explains that this Malaysian gesture involves placing the hands together, palms up, and looking at them.

Therefore, the gesture that signifies ""kozonga"" (waiting, keeping a lookout) in the Malaysian context, as described in the text, is placing hands together, palms up, on top of each other.  This corresponds directly to option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Koningisa loboko na loboko etali na kati (Placing hand on hand in the middle):** This doesn't align with the Malaysian description of palms up and looking at the hands.
*   **B: Kogumba mosapi ya mibale (Clapping hands):**  This gesture is not mentioned in the text in connection with ""kozonga"" or any other meaning.
*   **D: Koningisa mutu (Touching a person):**  This is too general and not specific to a gesture signifying ""kozonga."" The passage describes a hand gesture, not a touch.



"
"Na kotalela oyo eleki,  nini esalaka ete mabele epasuka?","The correct answer is **C: Mabulu ya glace oyo ezali kokweya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bifelo na likolo ya mabulu ya glace ekoki kokwea mpe bisika efungwama ekoki kokangama."" This translates to ""The crystals in the ice cream can melt and the places where it is frozen can crack."" This directly explains why the ice cream melts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gbagba ya mbula-mpembe (Ice crystal formation):** While ice crystal formation *is* part of how ice cream is made, it doesn't directly explain *why* it melts. The text focuses on the melting of existing ice cream.
* **B: Baglacier oyo ezali makasi te (Poor refrigeration):**  While poor refrigeration *can* cause melting, the text doesn't explicitly state that the refrigeration is poor. It focuses on the internal process of melting.
* **D: Mabanga oyo ekangami te (Unbreakable containers):** This is irrelevant to why the ice cream melts. The text discusses the ice cream itself, not its container.



"
"Kolandana na bokomi, oyo wapi kati na yango ekoki kobombama na gbagba ya mbula-mpembe?","The correct answer is **A: Bipasuka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bifelo na likolo ya mabulu ya glace ekoki kokwea mpe bisika efungwama ekoki kokangama."" This translates to ""The edges of the ice cream are capable of melting and the places where it's enclosed can break.""

Therefore, the melting process (""bipasuka"") is directly linked to the ability of the ice cream to melt in the rain (""bagbagba ya neige""). The other options are not directly mentioned as having this ability:

* **B: Mabulu ya glace (Ice cream scoops):** These are tools *used* to serve the ice cream, not parts that melt.
* **C: Bifelo (Edges):** The passage says the edges *can* melt, but the question asks which part *can* melt in the rain, implying a more general capability. ""Bipasuka"" refers to the ice cream melting overall.
* **D: Mabanga ya minene (Large pieces):**  The passage discusses the overall melting of the ice cream, not the melting of large pieces.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bato oyo basalaka mibembo basengeli kosala makambo mosusu liboso ya kokende na esika nini?","The correct answer is **A: Volcan ya Nyiragongo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the volcanic activity of Nyiragongo is the reason for the danger and the need for caution when traveling to Goma. The passage emphasizes the volcano's location and its impact on the city.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Bitando oyo ezali zingazinga ya Goma (Areas near Goma):** While dangerous, the passage focuses on the *source* of the danger (the volcano) rather than just the areas affected.
*   **C: Na katikati ya engumba (In the middle of the lake):** This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda is mentioned as a neighboring country, but the primary danger and focus of the passage is the volcano within the Democratic Republic of Congo.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala toli malamu te mpo na touriste na Goma?","The correct answer is **B: Ezali esika malamu mpo na Mountain Gorilla Tracking na talo moke** (It's a good place for Mountain Gorilla Tracking on a volcano).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions that Goma is near the Nyiragongo volcano and that it's a location for Mountain Gorilla Tracking.
* Options A, C, and D describe facts about Goma (its location, transportation, and the volcano), but don't highlight a specific tourist attraction or activity as strongly as Mountain Gorilla Tracking.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the information provided."
Ntango nini ndingisa ya nsima ya mboka mpo na mokolo ya kobanda na sanza ya mwambe ekobanda kozwama?,"The correct answer is **A: 1 sanza ya yambo janvier** (January 1st).

The text explicitly states: ""Batiaka ndelo na ndingisa mpona kobatela canyon mpe ebimaki na mokolo ya 1 ya sanza, basanza minei liboso ya sanza ya ebandeli. Bisika ya pamba na bisika mingi ya bato mingi, na ndakisa Bright Angel Campground adjacent na Phantom Ranch, mbala mingi etondaka na bademande oyo bazwaka na date ya liboso oyo bafungolaka po bato bakanga bisika. **Eza na mantango moke ya bandingisa babongisa mpona bosengi kozanga kokanga esika liboso na kolanda mobeko bakopesa naino na moto ayei liboso.**""

This translates to: ""They set rules to protect the canyon, and it's very crowded on January 1st. The campground and the Bright Angel Campground adjacent to Phantom Ranch are often occupied by people who plan their trips for the annual date they've been hoping for to see loved ones. **It's a very busy time, so reservations are required to camp there.**""

The question asks when the *early morning shuttle* to the rim will depart. The text mentions the crowded conditions on January 1st, implying that the shuttle schedule is affected by this high volume of visitors.  The text also directly states that reservations are *required* for camping on January 1st, further reinforcing that it's a peak travel date.
"
Politiki nini ezali mpo na kobatela ngomba?,"The correct answer is **D: Motango moke ya mikanda ya ndingisa**.

Here's why:

The text describes a very strict reservation system for hiking into the Grand Canyon.  It mentions:

* **Reservations are required:** ""Kofanda nyonso na nse pene ya Grand Canyon esengaka kozwa liboso ndingisa na mboka."" (All trips below the Grand Canyon must be reserved in advance.)
* **Reservations are made far in advance:** ""Batiaka ndelo na ndingisa mpona kobatela canyon mpe ebimaki na mokolo ya 1 ya sanza, basanza minei liboso ya sanza ya ebandeli."" (Reservations are made to hike the canyon, and it fills up many months in advance.)
* **Reservations are for specific dates:** ""Ndingisa ya kotonga na bamboka ya date nyonso oyo ebandi na sanza ya mitano ekomonana banda mokolo ya 1 sanza ya yambo."" (The reservation system for all dates within the five-month hiking season starts on the 1st of the month.)
* **High demand:** ""Bisika ya pamba na bisika mingi ya bato mingi..."" (The parking and campsites are very crowded...)
* **Permits are needed for overnight stays:** ""...na ndakisa Bright Angel Campground adjacent na Phantom Ranch, na mbala mingi etondaka na bademande oyo bazwaka na date ya liboso oyo bafungolaka po bato bakanga bisika. Eza na mantango moke ya bandingisa babongisa mpona bosengi kozanga kokanga esika liboso na kolanda mobeko bakopesa naino na moto ayei liboso."" (...and Bright Angel Campground adjacent to Phantom Ranch is often occupied by people who book dates far in advance for those hiking with loved ones. It is a very competitive process to request permits for overnight stays based on the lottery system.)

All of these points indicate a highly competitive and challenging reservation system. Option D, ""Motango moke ya mikanda ya ndingisa"" (Highly competitive reservation system), accurately summarizes the text's description.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Reservations are made far in advance:** While true, this describes *a part* of the system, not the whole.
* **B: Reservations are required:**  Again, true, but not the whole picture of the *difficulty* of obtaining a reservation.
* **C: The reservation system starts on the 1st of the month:**  This is a specific detail, not the overarching description.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozwama mingi te na lolenge ya ba otɛlɛ oyo elobelami na mokapo yango?","The best answer is **D: Bisika ya kolala oyo euti kobongisama sika na bibongisi ya mikolo oyo (Places of rest that are constantly connected to daily needs)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the convenience and amenities of hotels.** It mentions they are located in areas frequented by business travelers, offering luxury and comfort. It also points out the evolving model of hotels, incorporating modern conveniences and even medical services.
* **Option D directly reflects this emphasis on convenience.**  ""Bisika ya kolala oyo euti kobongisama sika na bibongisi ya mikolo oyo"" (Places of rest that are constantly connected to daily needs) encapsulates the idea that hotels are designed to fulfill travelers' needs and provide a comfortable, convenient experience. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Esika ya masanga (Medical centers)** While some hotels offer medical services, the passage doesn't primarily focus on them as the defining characteristic of hotels.
* **B: Esika ya kolia oyo eyebani (Shopping centers)**  While hotels might be near shopping centers, the passage focuses on the hotel itself and its amenities, not its proximity to shopping.
* **C: Baninga bapaya oyo bayebani malamu (Known criminals who are knowledgeable)** This option is completely unrelated to the passage's description of hotels and their appeal to travelers.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer as it best reflects the passage's core message about the convenience and amenities offered by hotels.



"
"Na kotalela makambo oyo mapesami na mokapo, makabo nini kati na makabo oyo elandi, bapaya ya hotel bakotya na esika ya liboso mingi te?","The correct answer is **C: Esika ya kofanda oyo epesaka bosepelisi ya butu (Places to stay that offer a sense of luxury).**

Here's why:

The passage states that hotels are often located in places frequented by wealthy people, are often very expensive, and offer a luxurious and comfortable experience. It also mentions that these hotels are often associated with exclusive events and VIP guests.  Therefore, the primary concern for hotel owners in this context is the allure of luxury and the ability to attract and retain high-paying clientele.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Biloko ya ndako ya kala na esika mobimba (Old historical buildings in beautiful locations):** While historical buildings can be beautiful, the passage emphasizes luxury and current trends, not historical significance.
* **B: Esika ya kolia oyo ezali na molambi moko ya lokumu (Locations that are only accessible by private jet):**  While a potential draw, the passage doesn't focus on accessibility by private jet as the core concern.
* **D: Ntalo ya esika ya kolala ezali malamu (The sleeping arrangements are comfortable):** Comfort is important, but the passage highlights luxury and exclusivity *beyond* basic comfort.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esengeli koboya na bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo oyo bazali kokende kotala Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: Kolobelaka moto moko ya mboka Greenland lokola “Eskimo”**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ata soki okoki koyoka bana-mboka ya Groenland bazosalela liloba wana, bapaya basengeli komeka te kosalela yango. Bakolo-mboka ya Groenlande bamibengaka baInuits na Canada pe Kalaalleq (pluriel Kalaallit), moto ya Groenlande, na lokota ya Groenlande. **Koboma bato, pe makanisi mabe epai ya bapaya, eyebani mpenza te na Groenland.**""

This passage clearly condemns the use of the term ""Eskimo"" as offensive and harmful. The text emphasizes that it's a derogatory term that should not be used.  The other options are related to Greenland but not directly condemned in the text in the same strong way as using the term ""Eskimo.""
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozala mokakatano mingi mpo na bato oyo bamibongisi te oyo bazali kokende kotala Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Mopepe**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mopepe ya malili eza likama oyo mbala mosusu kaka bato oyo babongami te nde bakokutana na yango."" (The cold air is a phenomenon that most people who don't live there encounter.)

The text also mentions the dangers of the cold (frostbite, inability to sleep, and diseases). Therefore, the cold air (opepe) poses the most significant risk to those unfamiliar with Greenland.
"
"Na oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalelami sikawa lokola esika ya monene ya katikati?","The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Sikoyo ezosala lokola esika monene ya plaza, mpe mbala mingi ezalaka na misala mingi..."" (It functions as a large square/plaza...). This directly describes the Jardín de la Unión.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * Balabala ya Beze (Balabala ya Beze) is not mentioned in the text.
    * Tempelo ya San Diego (Templo de San Diego) is described as being *where* the Jardín de la Unión used to be, not *being* the large square itself.
    * Allée ya kopesana ba bisous (Allée du Baiser) is a small alley, not a large square.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezwami te na Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **C: Bisika ya kolia oyo etali elanga**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Eza na malewa mingi zingazinga ya elanga..."" (It has a lot of shade from the sun...)
* The question asks what is *not* found in Jardín de la Unión.
* The passage describes the *Templo de San Diego* as having shade from the sun.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esika ya katikati libanda oyo ezali na baconcert** - The text says concerts are held *under* the gazebo in the center.
* **B: Ndako ya lisolo ya bolingo ya kala** - The *Callejon del Beso* (Alley of the Kiss) is mentioned, but the text says it's a small space, not a place of romance itself.
* **D: Ndako moko ya kala ya couvent** - The text mentions a former convent, but it's now only the *Templo de San Diego*.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo elobeli kotambola na bangomba mokolo moko ekotalelama lokola ya sikisiki te?","The best answer is **C: Bato oyo bazali na nivo ya nzoto kolɔngɔnɔ ya moke bazalaka mingimingi na likoki ya kosepela na mosala yango.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** Where does the text say that performing a long-distance jump in one go is not possible?
* **The text states:** ""Mpona mokolo ya kotambola na nzela moko ya pete, komibongisa moke eza ntina pe moto nyonso oyo abongi moke akoki kosepela na yango."" (For a single-jump record, the person must be able to land on it.) This implies that it *is* possible for those with sufficient skill.
* **Option C directly addresses this:** It suggests that people with a very high level of skill are often capable of performing this feat.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Esengeli komibongisa mingi te mpo na kotambola na bangomba ya mokolo moko na banzela ya facile** (It doesn't necessarily require a lot of training to perform a single-jump record easily) - This contradicts the text, which implies significant training is required.
* **B: Ntaka ekeseni, kasi esalemi mpo na kosala yango na boumeli ya mokolo moko** (The ground is firm, but it's prepared for a single-jump record) - This talks about the ground, not the athlete's ability.
* **D: Kotambola na bangomba na mokolo ezali mosala oyo ebongi te na libándá mpo na mabota oyo ezali na bana mike** (Performing a single jump is not a practice that is appropriate for young children) - While the text mentions young children, it doesn't say that it's inherently impossible for adults or skilled athletes.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided text."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini kotambola na bangomba ya mokolo moko esɛngaka komibongisa mpenza moke?","The correct answer is **A: Ntango moto oyo azali kotambola na bangomba azali nzoto kolongono** (When the person who is fishing is a beginner).

Here's why:

The prompt states that fishing is often done for enjoyment, especially with family. It also mentions that beginners often get a lot of bites, even if they don't catch anything. This suggests that beginners are more likely to experience the ""makomi oyo eleki"" (the things that happen, implying a lot of bites, even if they don't keep the fish).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Ntango esɛngaka nzela ya kotambola oyo ezali facile koleka** (When the fishing method is easy): While ease of use can be a factor, the prompt focuses more on the beginner experience and the abundance of bites.
*   **C: Tango bana bazali kokende kotambola** (When children are going fishing): The prompt doesn't directly link children going fishing to increased bites. It mentions fishing as a family activity.
*   **D: Tango kotambola ezali na environnement plus naturel** (When fishing is in a more natural environment): The prompt doesn't specify that a natural environment leads to more bites.



Therefore, the most logical answer is that beginners often experience a lot of bites, even if they don't catch many fish.



"
Nini ekeseni na bisika ya plateau na Rogaland to na Agder soki tokokanisi yango na mikili mosusu ya Norvège?,"The correct answer is **D: Mbala mingi, ezipaka yango na ba bruyères (Mbala mingi, they are covered in heathlands)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Na Rogaland pe na Agder, babengaka bango mbala mingi """"hei"""" oyo elimboli nzela ezangi banzete oyo mbala mingi ezalaka na babruyère."" This translates to ""In Rogaland and Agder, they often call ""hei"" which refers to these plateaus that are often covered in heathlands.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazali na banzete (They are in heathlands):** While heathlands are *a* characteristic of the plateaus, the sentence indicates they are *often* covered in them, not exclusively so.
* **B: Babongo ezali te (They are not):** This is directly contradicted by the text, which describes the plateaus in Rogaland and Agder.
* **C: Ba plateaux ezalaka mingi (The plateaus are many):** The text doesn't compare the number of plateaus in Rogaland and Agder to the rest of Norway. It focuses on their characteristics.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kati na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala ya momeseno te mpo na Norvège?","The correct answer is **D: Mabwaku (Fjords)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that fjords are the main reason for the plateaus (vidde) in Norway.  It describes how these plateaus are formed by glaciers and how they are often used as routes to the plateaus from the coast.

The other options are not mentioned or implied as being primary reasons for the existence of the plateaus:

* **A: Bitando ya mabele oyo ezali polele (Small animal habitats):** The passage doesn't mention animals or their habitats in relation to the plateaus.
* **B: Babwaku oyo ezali na bazamba (Mountains with glaciers):** While glaciers contribute to the formation of the plateaus, the passage focuses on fjords as the primary influencing factor. Also, the passage specifically refers to the *plateaus* (vidde) not just mountains.
* **C: Babongo ya mabanga (Bird colonies):** No mention of bird colonies and their relation to the plateaus is found in the passage.



Therefore, **mabwaku (fjords)** is the most directly related and correct answer based on the text.
"
Ntango nini ba touristes oyo balingi kosala ski basengeli kokende na ba gares ya bangomba?,"The correct answer is **A: Na ntango ya malili (In winter)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that skiing and snowboarding are popular in the winter due to the presence of snow.
* Option A directly reflects this information.
* Options B, C, and D refer to other seasons where snow is typically not available for these activities.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mbala mingi ntango nini baturiste bazalaka mingi na bisika ya kozela ya bangomba?","The correct answer is **D: na basanza nionso ya eleko ya malili** (during all seasons of winter sports).

Here's why:

* The text states that ski resorts and snowboarding areas are popular in the winter. However, it also mentions that in many places, these areas are also used for other winter activities like snowmobiling.  Therefore, they are utilized during *all* winter seasons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na ntango ya ba bouts ya neige makasi** (During the peak of snow season): While this is *a* time when people go, the text doesn't say it's *the only* time.
* **B: Na eleko mobimba ya snowboard** (During the peak of snowboarding season):  The text mentions snowboarding, but it doesn't limit the popularity of the resorts *only* to snowboarding season.
* **C: Na ntango yam oi makasi** (During the hottest time): This is incorrect, as winter sports occur in cold weather.



"
Nini osengeli koboya kosala soki ozali na elikya ya kozwa masuwa oyo ezali koluka lisalisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kosakolala misala na yo (Control your actions)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where the speaker is in a new and potentially dangerous environment (a marina). They are overwhelmed by people and the opportunity for theft.  The question asks what to do if someone tries to steal their belongings.

The best course of action is to be aware of your surroundings and actively control your behavior to avoid being a target. This means being cautious, not drawing attention to yourself, and being vigilant.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: Kotambola likoló mpe na nse na ba quais (Running to the docks and quays):** This is a reactive measure and might not solve the problem.  It could also attract attention.
* **B: Kosala boninga na ba capitaines (Be polite to the captains):** Politeness is good, but it won't prevent theft.
* **D: Kozanga koyeba baninga oyo basalaka autostop ya masuwa (Avoiding people who ask for rides):** While caution is good, completely avoiding people could limit your ability to get help or information. It doesn't address the core issue of being a target.



Therefore, **C: Kosakolala misala na yo** is the most proactive and effective way to deal with the situation described.  It's about personal safety and awareness.



"
Nini osengeli kosala zingazinga ya ba marinas ntango ozali koluka masuwa oyo ezali na mposa ya lisalisi?,"The correct answer is **A: Sala boyokani na bato oyo basalaka na masuwa** (Talk to the people who are working on the docks).

Here's why:

* **The problem:** The first part of the text describes the anxieties and difficulties of someone new to a marina, specifically related to buying a boat. They are overwhelmed, afraid of being ripped off, and unsure how to navigate the process.
* **The question:** Asks what to do to avoid being scammed when buying a boat at the marina.
* **Why A is correct:** Talking to the people who work at the marina (salespeople, mechanics, etc.) provides valuable information, insights, and potential warnings. They can offer advice, explain market prices, and alert you to potentially shady dealings.  This is proactive and helps build trust.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Tikala na nse ya radar** (Stay on the radar):  This is irrelevant to avoiding scams. Radar is for navigation.
    * **C: Bopusana penepene na bato kaka tango bazali kosukola yacht na bango** (Only interact closely with people when they are fixing your yacht):  This is too limited.  You should interact with people *before* you need repairs.
    * **D: Bokima baninga oyo basalaka kotelemisa mituka** (Pretend to be people who are repairing boats): This is deceptive and likely to backfire.

Therefore, seeking advice and information from marina professionals is the best way to mitigate the risk of being scammed.
"
Esika nini ekosepelisa motamboli oyo asepeli na makambo ya kala y aba oyo bakonzaki esanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Libongo ya Nord (North Point)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bokoli mingi ya bamboka ya esanga ya Hong Kong etonda mpenza na mabele oyo ezalaka na ndambu ya nordi ya libongo."" (A lot of the Hong Kong Disneyland's souvenir money is spent on animals that are located in North Point.)

The text also mentions that the area is where the British colonialists established themselves: ""Wana eza esika oyo bato ya Grande Bretagne oyo bakonzaki babotolaki, yango wana soki ozoluka bilembeteli ya makambo ya kala ya bato bakonzaki na teritware wana, oyo eza esika ya malamu ya kobanda."" (It is the place where the British people who established this area lived, so if you're looking for the remnants of the people who established this territory, it's in the south.)  While the south is mentioned in relation to the British, the North Point is directly linked to the souvenirs and animals, and thus the location where people spend money related to the historical aspect.
"
Esika nini ekosepelisa mopaya oyo atyaka na esika ya liboso bisika ya kotala ya kokamwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Esanga ya Hong Kong**.

The text explicitly states: ""Badefile ya bandako oyo ekomisaka Hong Kong kitoko, bakokanisi yango na **foto ya kitoko ya bare oyo ezomonana polele mpona mai kitoko ya libongo ya Victoria.**""  This means the beauty of Hong Kong is often represented by the view of Victoria Harbour.  The question asks what *makes* the scenery worth watching, and the passage highlights the beauty of the harbor as a key element.
"
Nini mabulu ya punda mosusu ezali na yango mpo na kosalisa mpo na kokitisa likama ya lokolo ya mokumbi mpunda kokangama na motambo?,"The correct answer is **B: Mabende ya libateli (Shoe soles)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mpona kokitisa likama, esengeli kozwa mwa bibongiseli ya libateli."" This translates to ""To prevent slipping, you need to use shoe attachments.""  The passage then goes on to explain that shoe soles are made of leather and are attached to the shoe.

Therefore, the shoe soles are the part that prevent the foot from slipping and causing the boot to slip.
"
Eloko nini ya botte ya komata esalisaka mpo na kobakisa libateli ya mokumbi motuka ntango azali kosalela bitanda?,"The correct answer is **A: semelle moko ya mabe mpe ya moke (sole that is hard and thick)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ya liboso, bakumbi mingi ya bavelo balakaka basapatu eza na talon ya malamu mpe semelle ya pete, ya mwa moke.""  This translates to: ""Often, many people wear shoes with high heels and a thick, hard sole."" 

The question asks what part of the boot helps to support the foot when walking. A thick, hard sole provides the necessary support and stability.  The other options are incorrect:

* **B: cuir (leather):** While leather is used for the upper part of the boot, it doesn't provide the primary support for the foot.
* **C: talon moko (single heel):** A single heel wouldn't offer balanced support.
* **D: Litambe ya monene (large platform):**  A large platform might be used in some boots, but the passage specifically mentions a *thick and hard* sole, implying a functional sole rather than a large platform.



"
Nini Lisanga ya boyambi epesaka basali mobembo?,"The correct answer is **D: Boyokani na bato mosusu ya mobembo oyo bakendaka na esika moko**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""Lisanga ya boyambi"" as a system that connects people who are traveling to the same place. The core function is to facilitate connection and sharing of information among these travelers. This implies a network of people who are all engaged in the same activity (traveling to a specific location) and can therefore interact with each other.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bisika ya kolala na bayambi ya mboka:** While finding accommodation is part of travel, the passage doesn't focus on housing arrangements. It's about connecting with other travelers.
* **B: Ba vols ya talo moke:** Flights are a mode of transportation, not the central concept of the ""Lisanga ya boyambi.""
* **C: Kotala esika epesami na batambwisi ya mboka:**  Finding information about locations is a benefit, but the main feature is the connection *between* the travelers themselves.



"
"Na kotalela eteni yango, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo etali ba réseaux d’échange hospitalité ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **C: Bakopesa bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo liste ya bato oyo bakoki koyamba bango na engumba oyo bakokende.**

Here's why:

The text describes ""lisanga ya boyambi"" (hostels or hospitality networks) as a system where people who host travelers provide references to other hosts.  It highlights that this system helps travelers find places to stay and also relies on a network of hosts helping each other. Option C directly reflects this: ""Bakopesa bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo liste ya bato oyo bakoki koyamba bango na engumba oyo bakokende"" translates to ""They provide hosts with a list of people who can help them on the journey."" This accurately describes the core function of these hospitality networks as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bapesaka ntango nyonso bato oyo basalaka mibembo ba références mpo na bayambi ya mboka** (They always provide references for hosts to other hosts) - While references are part of the system, it's not stated that they *always* do this.
* **B: Ba réseaux misusu ekoki kosenga vérification ya kobakisa ya ba voyageurs** (Multiple networks can ensure the verification of travelers) - The text doesn't mention verification of travelers. The focus is on connecting hosts and providing resources.
* **D: Maloba ya bapaya ya mboka epesamaka ntango mosusu mpo na batu ya mobembo** (The information of dishonest hosts is shared often with travelers) - The text doesn't discuss how dishonest hosts are handled. The emphasis is on the positive aspects of the network.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya mopaya oyo akoki kozwama mingi te na shambre ya auberge oyo bato bakabolaka?","The correct answer is **B: Invité moko oyo azali kosala mobembo ye moko**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the most likely reason a hotel room might be so expensive, even when many guests are staying there.**  The text states that hotels often charge a lot, even though guests might be there for events.
* **Option B, ""Invité moko oyo azali kosala mobembo ye moko"" (One guest who is having a party on their own), directly addresses this.** A single guest having a party would likely cause extra wear and tear, require extra cleaning, and potentially disturb other guests, justifying a higher price.
* **Option A** is too vague. While a general ""damage"" is possible, it doesn't explain *why* the price is so high.
* **Option C** is plausible, but less likely to be the *main* reason for high prices compared to a single disruptive guest.
* **Option D** is unlikely. A guest having a room for multiple times doesn't automatically justify high prices, unless it involves significant disruption or extra services.



Therefore, a single guest having a party in their room is the most plausible reason for the higher cost, even with many other guests staying at the hotel."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani azali na likoki mingi ya kofanda na auberge?","The question asks who is *most likely* to be staying at a hotel for a long time because of their children. The provided text mentions that families with children often stay at hotels for extended periods (around 20 days) due to activities or events.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Babalani moko bazali kosala mobembo elongo na mwana oyo abotami sika (A single parent is attending a long conference with their sick child).** While a single parent might stay for a long time, the reason is the sick child, not necessarily an event. This makes it less likely to be a typical family situation.
* **B: Bana misato ya mbula 22 bazali kosala mobembo elongo (22-year-old twins are attending a long conference).**  These are adults, not children.
* **C: Mobali na mwasi oyo bazali na mbula koleka 70 (A couple over 70 are attending a long conference).**  While older couples might travel, the question focuses on families with *children*.
* **D: Mabota mibale bazali kosala mobembo elongo na bana na bango (Elderly people are attending a long conference with their children).** This option directly addresses the scenario described in the text – elderly people staying for a long time because of their children (presumably to help with childcare or attend events with them).

Therefore, **D** is the most likely answer.



**Final Answer: D**"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki kobwaka boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: Ekozonga ntango nyonso na lobɔkɔ na yo soki babwaki yango malamu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Baboomerangs ebele oyo ezalaka na Australie ezongaka mpenza te. Eza malamu mingi mpona bato ya sika na komeka te komibwaka na mopepe."" This means many boomerangs in Australia aren't thrown well and are difficult to catch.
* **The question asks:** ""Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki kobwaka boomerang?"" (Based on the text, where is it difficult to throw a boomerang accurately?)
* **Option A directly addresses this:** ""Ekozonga ntango nyonso na lobɔkɔ na yo soki babwaki yango malamu"" (It only works if you throw it with skill). This aligns with the passage's implication that throwing a boomerang accurately requires practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezali kosepela mingi na bato ya mboka koleka batouriste** (It's more common with locals than tourists): The passage doesn't mention who throws boomerangs accurately.
* **C: Ba boomerangs ezali mingi te na Australie** (Boomerangs are not common in Australia): The passage states the opposite - boomerangs *are* in Australia, but many aren't thrown well.
* **D: Kaka ba boomerangs mosusu nde ekoki kozonga** (More boomerangs can throw accurately): The passage implies that *skill* is more important than the number of boomerangs.



"
"Na biloko oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalelamaka mingimingi na bilei ya Java?","The correct answer is **B: Sukali ya mputulu**.

The passage states: ""bilei oyo bato ya Javanais balingaka mingi eza nguba, pilipili, le sukali (mingimingi sukali ya coco ya Javanais) pe biloko ya ndenge na ndenge ya kokomisa bilei elengi.""  This translates to: ""...which the Javanese people love greatly is ginger, chili, sugar (mostly Javanese coconut sugar) and other ingredients for making delicious dishes."" While it mentions ""sukali ya coco ya Javanais"" (Javanese coconut sugar), the question asks about the most commonly used sugar in Java. ""Sukali ya mputulu"" (palm sugar) is a very common and important type of sugar in Indonesian cuisine, especially in Java.  The other options are not mentioned in the passage.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini maladi oyo ezwamaka na bato epalanganaka?","The correct answer is **D: Kopesa mangwele (Spreading infection)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes infectious diseases as diseases caused by pathogens (viruses, microbes, etc.) that can be transmitted from one person to another. 
* Option D, ""Kopesa mangwele,"" which translates to ""Spreading infection,"" directly reflects this transmission process.
* Options A, B, and C are too specific. While microbes (B) *cause* infection, and people in contact (A) can facilitate it, the core mechanism of how infectious diseases spread is *infection spreading*. Bacteria (C) is a *type* of microbe, not the overall process of infection spreading.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini eyebani te ete epesaka bokono ya kozwama?","The correct answer is **A: Kopesa mangwele (Spreading germs)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Maladi oyo epanzanaka eza maladi oyo ekoki kopesama na moto mosusu soki aza pene ya moto oyo aza na maladi wana."" This translates to ""Contagious diseases are diseases that can be transmitted to another person if they are near a person who has the disease.""
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Biyangeli mingi esengaka bapaya oyo bazokota, to bato oyo bazobima, na mikili na bango na kozwa mangwele ya maladi mingi."" This translates to ""Many germs spread through coughing, sneezing, or even through their hands causing the spread of disease.""

Options B, C, and D (Viruses, Bacteria, and Fungi) are *examples* of what can cause contagious diseases, but the *mechanism* by which the disease spreads is the spread of germs. Therefore, ""Kopesa mangwele"" is the most accurate answer to the question ""Nini eyebani te ete epesaka bokono ya kozwama?"" (What is it that causes the risk of catching a disease?).
"
Ntango nini okoki kopona proxy web na esika ya oyo apesaka VPN ya yo moko ekokoka mpo na mosaleli?,"The correct answer is **B: Mosaleli azali komibanzabanza mpo na koboya bopekiseli mpe kolanda na sekele na ndenge ekoki.**

Here's why:

* **Proxies web are often used to circumvent restrictions and blockages.**  They can be set up to analyze and reroute traffic to avoid censorship or firewalls. This aligns with option B's description of the proxy's behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Mosaleli alingi kobalisa nzela nionso (The provider wants to block all traffic).** While a provider might *attempt* to block traffic, proxies are generally set up to manage *specific* types of traffic, not all of it.  A complete block would be a more general network security measure, not the primary function of a proxy.
* **C: Mosaleli azali na libosokopesa nzela lisusu ya trafic http (The provider has an additional way to route HTTP traffic).** While a proxy *can* handle HTTP, this isn't the core reason for using a proxy in the context of someone trying to hide their IP. The purpose is about masking the origin of the traffic, not just providing another route for HTTP.
* **D: Mosala ya mosali esengaka nivo ya bande passante ya moyenne to ya likolo (The proxy's operation is at the level of average or high bandwidth).** Bandwidth is relevant to performance, but it doesn't explain *why* a proxy might be used to hide an IP address.  The motivation is security and anonymity, not just bandwidth considerations.



Therefore, option B best explains why a proxy web might be used to hide the IP address associated with a VPN, as it describes the proxy's role in redirecting and potentially obfuscating traffic.



"
"Nakotala oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo etali ba VPN mpe baproxy web ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **B: Baproxy web ekoki ko redirectionner trafic web nyonso te**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks where VPNs and web proxies are not the *only* solution.** The original text states that web proxies can handle *everything* on the internet, not just HTTP.  This implies that VPNs, while offering a solution, aren't the *sole* option.
* **Option A:** While VPNs *do* offer more bandwidth than web proxies, this doesn't address the core question about alternatives.
* **Option C:**  It's true web proxies *can* be used with VPNs, but this doesn't make them the only solution.
* **Option D:** The text explicitly states web proxies handle *everything* on the internet, not just HTTP.  VPNs are often associated with HTTP traffic, but this isn't an absolute.

Therefore, the statement that web proxies can handle *all* internet traffic, unlike solely relying on VPNs, makes option B the most accurate response to the question.
"
Nini epesaka moto nzela ya kosalela kompanyi ya telefone na libanda ya esika oyo azali penepene na ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Basatellite**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""okoki kozwa connection ya satelite ya internet na bazamba ya Chicken, Alaska pe na banimero mosusu oyo ezomonisa oza na moi ya Arizona."" This means satellite internet provides a way to connect to phone companies even when geographically distant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kobenga na intenrtoyo elekisami** (Internet doesn't work): This is incorrect; the passage describes how internet *does* work in this situation.
*   **B: Mitango ya telefone ya mokili mobimba** (Advanced telephone technology): While advanced technology is involved, the passage highlights the use of satellites as the key enabling factor for remote phone service.
*   **D: Batelefone ya PSTN** (PSTN telephones): The passage states that you often need to dial a specific number to connect to the PSTN, but it doesn't explain *how* that connection is made in remote areas - it relies on the other technologies mentioned.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kosalema mpo na kozwa mabiangi mosusu?","The correct answer is **A: Somba numero ya mokili mobimba** (Use a different, more international number).

Here's why:

The problem describes a situation where the user's location is consistently being routed through very distant locations (Chicken, Alaska, Arizona) when using the internet, leading to difficulties with phone calls. This suggests a routing issue based on the user's IP address or location information.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Salela kompanyi moko ya telefone oyo ezali na esika ofandi** (Contact a phone company located where you are).  This wouldn't directly address the routing problem.  Even if you contacted a local company, the issue seems to be about how your internet connection is being perceived globally.
* **C: Zwa numero moko epai ya bato ya mboka na bino** (Get a number in a foreign country). This might help bypass some routing issues, but it doesn't fix the underlying cause.
* **D: Somba telefone ya PSTN** (Use a PSTN telephone). This is irrelevant to the problem description.  The issue is with the *internet* connection, not with traditional phone lines.

Using a different, more internationally recognized number (option A) is the most logical first step to try and bypass the incorrect routing that is causing the problems. It gives the system a different location to work with.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elimboli na bosikisiki te ndenge oyo maloba ya Italien ebengamaka?","The correct answer is **A: r mibale ebengamaka ndenge mosusu na r moko**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks which option *doesn't* represent how Italian words are pronounced.**  The passage explicitly states that ""r"" is pronounced differently in Italian than in many other languages, often as a trilled ""r"" (like in Spanish).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maloba mingi ebengamaka ndenge ekomami (Most words are pronounced as they are written):** While Italian has relatively consistent spelling, there are exceptions, especially with vowels and combinations like ""c"" and ""g.""
* **C: Maloba oyo ezali na balɛtrɛ c mpe g ekoki kozala na mayele mabe (Words with 'c' and 'g' can be tricky):**  The passage *does* mention that ""c"" and ""g"" can have different sounds depending on the following vowel.  So this is *a* way words are pronounced, not a way they *don't* sound like.
* **D: Ndenge ya kobenga maloba mingi ekeseni na kotalela mongongo oyo elandi (The way words are pronounced depends on the vowel):** The passage *does* state that the pronunciation of ""c"" and ""g"" changes based on the vowel that follows them.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the ""r"" sound is pronounced differently from how it might be in other languages, and this is a key difference from standard pronunciation.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ya Izmir ebandaki liboso ya mikolo na biso?","The correct answer is **B: Bandako oyo ezali na talatala liboso**.

The text states: ""Baboulevards ya minene, bandako oyo bifelo eza na talatala liboso..."" This translates to ""Wide boulevards, the streets are constantly bustling...""  This directly answers the question of where one would see Izmir's life unfolding.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baboulevard ya minene (Wide boulevards):** While wide boulevards are mentioned, the *streets* themselves are where the life unfolds.
* **C: Bisika ya koteka ya mikolo oyo eza na bandako ya kala ya tuile ya motane (Places for lunch on the old stone streets):** This is a specific *activity* that happens in a certain place, not the general location of daily life.
* **D: Bansamba ya ndako oyo etiami batwili ya motani (Local vendors selling fresh produce):** This is another specific activity and location, not the overall environment.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ezaleli ya sikisiki ya Izmir te?","The correct answer is **B: atmosphère ezali komonisa Turquie traditionnelle** (The atmosphere is reminiscent of traditional Turkey).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na kala engumba Smyrne ya kala, sikoyo ekoma esika monene ya mombongo, babongisa malamu pe eza na bato mingi, eza **zingazinga ya libongo mpe ezingami na bangomba**."" This translates to ""Even though it's called the old Smyrne, it remains a major port, busy and with many people, it has a **flavor of the past and is filled with mosques and old churches**.""

Option B directly reflects this description of a traditional atmosphere, with mentions of mosques and old churches hinting at a historical and traditional feel.  The other options are less directly supported by the text:

* **A: Engumba yango ezingami na libongo moko monene** (Its atmosphere is not very modern) - While the passage mentions old buildings, it doesn't explicitly say the atmosphere is *not* modern, just that it retains a flavor of the past.
* **C: Okoki kokuta bisika ya kosomba biloko ya mikolo oyo mpe ba eglises ya kala** (You can find places to shop for antiques and old churches) - The passage *does* mention old churches, but doesn't emphasize antique shopping as a defining characteristic.
* **D: Ezali na libongo ya mibale ya monene na Turquie** (It is a major city in Turkey) -  The passage *does* state it's a major city, but this is a general fact, not a specific element of its unique atmosphere.



"
Liloba hanami ezali kolobela kotala nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Fololo ya cerisier** (Cherry blossoms).

The text explicitly states that ""hanami"" means looking at cherry blossoms.
"
Nani ayambaki bafeti ya liboso oyo epesamaki mpo na kotala bafololo ya cerise?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokonzi ya Japon**.

The text states: ""Na Japon, bafete ya liboso ya bafololo ebengami cerisier, emperere ye moko moto azalaki kobongisa yango na bato mosusu ya boyangeli na ye oyo bazalaki kosala na esambiselo."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the cherry blossom festivals are celebrated with cherry trees, and the emperor himself would invite many people to participate in the celebrations.""  This clearly indicates the Japanese government/emperor was the one who promoted and participated in these festivals.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo nini ya Yelusaleme oyo elandi, oyo ekoki kobenda bato mingi te?","The correct answer is **A: Ntina ya losambo ya engumba yango (The religious significance of the land)**.

Here's why:

* The provided text repeatedly emphasizes the deep religious significance of Jerusalem for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It mentions its history, the presence of holy sites, and its importance as a place of pilgrimage. 
* While the other options are true aspects of Jerusalem (cultural offerings, historical significance, ancient sites), the text stresses the **religious** significance as the core element that resonates most deeply and potentially affects many people.

Therefore, option A best captures the fundamental reason why Jerusalem is so important and emotionally charged for a large number of people.
"
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo lokola eloko oyo Yelusaleme eyebani mpo na yango?","The correct answer is **C: Ndimbola na makambo ya losambo (Religious significance)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Mpo engumba wana eza na ntina mingi na makambo ya Nzambe, mpe mingimingi mpona bisika mingi ya Engumba ya Kala, Yeruzaleme eza moko ya bisika oyo bato mingi oyo bakendaka kotala Yisalaele bakendaka kotala."" This translates to ""For this reason, it has great importance in religious matters, and for many places in the Old Testament, Jerusalem is one of the places that many who seek Israel seek.""

While the text mentions culture (bisikia ya bonkokoSites culturels) and politics (bopusi ya politiki), it emphasizes the religious importance of Jerusalem above all else.  The other options are less directly supported by the text.  The text focuses on its significance within religious history and belief.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya motu ya mobembo akozwa matomba te soki asombi Carte Sauvage?","The correct answer is **D: Motu ya mobembo oyo azali kotandisa kotala Kruger National Park mpe ata parc mosusu moko.**

Here's why:

* The text states that a Wild Card allows access to *any* park managed by SANParks (South African National Parks). 
* Therefore, a person who visits Kruger National Park *and* other parks within the SANParks network would benefit from purchasing a Wild Card.
* Options A and B are incorrect because the Wild Card isn't *only* for frequent visitors to SANParks or *only* for Kruger.
* Option C is irrelevant because the cost of visiting a park doesn't determine if a Wild Card is worthwhile.



"
Liloba nini elimboli na bosikisiki te Parc national ya Kruger?,"The correct answer is **B: Banyama ya zamba ekeseni na kati ya ba écozones ebele ya parc** (Wild animals are found in many different ecozones within the park).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Parke ezali 19 500 km² pe ekabwani na biteni 14 ekesene, eteni mokomoko esungaka banyama ya ndenge na ndenge."" (The park is 19,500 km² and extends over 14 provinces, forming a haven for a wide variety of animals.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Etalelami lokola esika monene ya kobenda bato na Afrique du Sud** (It is a large area for attracting people in South Africa) - While the park is large and attracts visitors, this isn't the *primary* reason it's significant, according to the passage.
* **C: Ezali parc ya moke koleka baparc ya Afrique du Sud** (It is the smallest park in South Africa) - The passage states the opposite: it's one of the largest.
* **D: Bapaya bakokota na kati na kosomba Carte ya Zamba** (People can pay to visit by purchasing a Wild Card) - This is mentioned in the passage, but it's not the fundamental reason for the park's importance.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kobimisa likama mingi mpo na bato oyo bamataka ngomba na biteni nyonso ya ngomba oyo ezali na mabangamabanga?","The correct answer is **A: Makambo ya mai (Ice)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Elingi koloba, mizela ete pema ekatana mpe keba na biteni ya mabe, mingimingi soki oza na mai, po ezokoma likama noki."" This translates to: ""It is said that some people get sick and suffer from severe headaches, especially if you are with water, as it can become a dangerous fever.""

Therefore, the key danger described is the presence of ice (or very cold temperatures related to water) leading to potential health problems.  The other options are not mentioned as significant dangers related to the climb.



"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali komonisa na bosikisiki te bomati ya ngomba Machu Picchu oyo elobelami na mokapo yango?","The correct answer is **C: Osengeli koleka na libulu moko oyo ezali na likoló**.

Here's why:

* The text emphasizes the extreme altitude and thin air at the top of the mountain. It specifically mentions the low oxygen levels and the need to ascend carefully.  This points directly to the importance of acclimatizing to the altitude gradually.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ata bato oyo bazali na nzoto kolɔngɔnɔ mpo na komata ngomba bakozanga mpema:** While people do take breaks, the core problem isn't simply about needing breaks. It's about the physical challenge of the altitude.
* **B: Ezali na baporte ya maboko te na biteni nyonso oyo ezali na nse mingi:**  The text states that steel cables are used for handholds, so this is incorrect.  It also doesn't focus on the altitude issue.
* **D: Biteni oyo ezali na nse mingi ekómaka likama ntango ezali na mai:**  The text says that the thin air is a problem, especially if you're already dehydrated. However, the *primary* concern is the altitude itself, not necessarily the presence of water.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the critical factor highlighted in the text: the necessity of ascending in stages to adjust to the altitude.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na kati ya biloko yango, oyo wapi ezali bilei ya ntina mingi te na bilei ya Majorque?","The correct answer is **D: Bandunda (Mountains)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Majorca is known for its mountains (""bandunda mingingi""). However, the text then says that the dishes mentioned (Pa amb Oli, etc.) are *not* typically associated with the mountains. The other options (Mapas, Lipa, and Mbuma) are all elements often found in Majorcan cuisine. Therefore, the mountains are the element *least* associated with the food mentioned.
"
"Na kotalela makambo oyo ezali na mokapo yango, maloba nini oyo elobeli bilei ya hangi ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **C: Mbala mingi, balambaka bilei ya mpokwa oyo batumbaki na lisalisi ya hangi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mbala mingi basalelaka hangi mpona kolamba bilei ya mboka na lolenge ya kotumba."" (Often, they drill to get hot water for heating and power.)
* **It also says:** ""Bisika ebele ya Rotorua ezalaka na biloko ebengami hangi géothermiques, kasi bisika mosusu bakoki kosalela yango lokola bilembo na Christchurch, na Wellington pe na bisika mosusu."" (Many areas of Rotorua have geothermal features, but elsewhere they can drill for it in Christchurch, Wellington, and other places.)

Option C directly reflects this information by saying they often drill for hot water from springs and vents associated with geothermal activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hangi géothermique esalelaka mabanga ya molunge oyo ewuti na moto mpo na kopelisa libulu yango** (Geothermal springs release steam that is used to heat buildings) - While steam *can* be used for heating, the passage emphasizes hot *water* as the primary resource being drilled for.
* **B: Hangi oyo esalelaka mabanga ya molunge ezali na Wellington** (The geothermal spring that releases steam is in Wellington) - The passage mentions Wellington as a place where drilling occurs, but doesn't specify that a particular *spring* there releases steam.
* **D: Hangi géothermique ekoki kozwama na Rotorua** (Geothermal features can be found in Rotorua) - This is true, but the question asks *why* drilling is often done - the answer is related to the availability of hot water from geothermal sources.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te lokola lolenge ya momesano ya kopelisa libulu ya hangi?","The correct answer is **A: Gaz (Gas)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the geothermal energy is used to heat water and create steam to generate electricity. It mentions steam, hot springs, and geysers. The options relate to sources of energy.  While geothermal energy *can* sometimes release gases, the text doesn't mention gas as a *primary* or *direct* result of using geothermal energy for power generation. The other options – hot water, steam, and hot springs – are all directly linked to the use of geothermal resources to create power.

Therefore, ""Gaz"" is the least directly connected to the described process.
"
Nini ekoki kosala ete monganga to sango moko ayebana na ndenge ya special?,"The correct answer is **A: Kolata enveloppe oyo ezipami na kongenga** (Donate an envelope that is folded).

Here's why:

* The passage describes a tradition in some monasteries where women donate money in envelopes (zipakama) and place them in a collection box.
* The question asks what to do with a special gift.
* Option A directly aligns with the described tradition of donating money in an envelope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kozipa mapeka na yo** (Attach a stamp to it): While you might attach a stamp to mail an envelope, it doesn't address the core action described in the passage.
* **C: Kodefa enveloppe na monastère** (Leave the envelope at the monastery):  The passage says women *bring* the envelopes to the monastery, they don't simply leave them.  Leaving it implies not participating in the donation process.
* **D: Kolata jupe oyo bakati likolo ya genoux** (Donate a skirt that ends at the knee): The passage mentions women wearing skirts that *zipaka mabolongo* (open or reveal their legs), but doesn't state that these are the only items they donate, nor does it directly imply this is the correct action for a special gift.



"
"Na bilamba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozala te mpo na kodefa na monastère? ","The correct answer is **A: Bajupes (Skirts)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Soki bakei kotala ba monastères, basengaka basi balata ba jupes oyo ezipaka mabolongo..."" which translates to ""If they come to visit monasteries, they wear skirts that cover their hair..."".  This implies skirts are the clothing worn by visitors to monasteries. The question asks what is *not* worn in a monastery, and the text highlights skirts as part of the attire.  Therefore, skirts are *what is worn*, and the options that are *not* worn would be the correct answers.

The question asks ""Oyo wapi ekoki kozala te mpo na kodefa na monastère?"" which means ""What can be found nowhere in a monastery?"". The text implies that skirts are typically worn, and therefore the other options are not worn, making them the correct answer to the question.
"
Ntango nini mopaya akozala na mabaku mingi ya kotala minzoto ntango azali kotala bisika ya Antarctique?,"The correct answer is **A: Na ntango ya sanza ya moi makasi (During the darkest months)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ezopesa libaku malamu ya komona baaurores boréales, mpo likolo ekozala mwa molili na boumeli ya mokolo mobimba."" This translates to: ""It provides a favorable place to see the aurora borealis, because the night is long and dark.""  The aurora borealis (Northern Lights) is best seen during periods of long periods of darkness, which are the darkest months of the year.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Ntango esika ezali na batu ebele te (When there are few people):**  The passage mentions that the area is sparsely populated, which is true regardless of the time of year. It's not the *reason* for aurora viewing.
*   **C: Ntango ya sanza ya malili makasi (During the shortest days):** While the shortest days correlate to the darkest time, the passage emphasizes the *long* night as the key factor for seeing the aurora.
*   **D: Ntango nivo ya kobebisa mopepe na mwinda ezali moke (When the moon phase is very bright):** A bright moon can interfere with seeing the aurora. The passage doesn't suggest a bright moon is favorable.



"
Ntango nini telefone ya satellite ekozala te eloko oyo ekoki kozwa esika ya telefone ya mabɔkɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Soki nzela ya komona na satellite ekoki kopekisama (If the connection to the satellite can be established)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that satellite phones often don't work where regular phones do because they need a clear line of sight to a satellite.  Therefore, the phone will be unusable if that connection *cannot* be established.  The other options aren't the primary reason:

*   **B: Soki esika yango ezali mosika mingi (If the location is very remote):** While remoteness *can* be a factor, it's the *ability to connect* that's the core issue. A remote location could still have a good satellite connection.
*   **C: Soki ekosalelama libanda (If there is a blockage):** Blockage is *part* of the problem, but the main issue is whether a connection can be made at all.
*   **D: Soki botindi esengi bosenga ya bansango mosusu (If there is too much interference from other signals):** Interference is possible, but again, the inability to *establish* a connection is the fundamental reason.



"
Ntango nini telefone ya satellite ekozala malamu koleka telefone ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntango bansango ya mosika ezali na ntina te (When there is no cellular network).**

Here's why:

* The question states that the bicycle phone relies on satellite phones because cellular networks aren't available.
* Option C directly reflects this situation - if there's no cellular network, the satellite phone is the only option.
* The other options are less directly related:
    * A: Being on vacation is not a universal condition.
    * B:  The middle of a market isn't inherently a situation where satellite is *more* useful than cellular.
    * D: Being able to see a satellite doesn't guarantee a signal.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate and logical answer based on the provided context."
Matata mpo na oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ememaki na kokela République ya Transnistrie?,"The correct answer is **A: Nkita**.

The text states: ""Na 1994, bitumba wana ebimisaki ekolo ya nsima oyo bango moko babengaki Transnistrie na este ya Moldavie, eza na boyangeli na yango mpe mosolo na yango, kasi ata lisanga moko te oyo eza kati ya ONU endima yango. Basali lisusu boyokani na makambo ya nkita...""

This directly translates to: ""In 1994, these territories seceded to form the independent Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, it is unrecognised and even now, no single organization within the UN recognises it. They have continued negotiations on border issues...""

Therefore, the primary issue surrounding the Republic of Transnistria is **border issues (nkita)**.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi République Transnistrie ezali na yango oyo ekeseni na Moldavie mobimba?  ","The correct answer is **A: Lokota**.

The text states: ""Na 1994, bitumba wana ebimisaki ekolo ya nsima oyo bango moko babengaki Transnistrie na este ya Moldavie, **eza na boyangeli na yango mpe mosolo na yango, kasi ata lisanga moko te oyo eza kati ya ONU endima yango.**""

This translates to: ""In 1994, these divisions became a new entity where they alone established Transnistria in the east of Moldova, **it is in a state of conflict and even no single organization within the UN recognizes it.**""

Therefore, Transnistria is in a state of **lokota** (conflict/state of tension) within Moldova.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini mobembo asengeli kokende na Montevideo soki azali na elikya ya kokima makambo ya mopepe?","The correct answer is **C: Na basanza ya eleko ya été ya Hémisphère du Nord** (In the summer season of the Northern Hemisphere).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Montevideo eza na bituka ya likolo ya tropicale; na basanza ya eleko ya molunge, mbala ba temperature ekomaki kino na +30°C."" (Montevideo has a tropical climate; during the summer season, the temperature reaches +30°C.)
* **It also mentions:**  ""mbula ebetaka ndenge moko na bileko nyonso mbula mobimba."" (the sun shines the same way throughout the year, much more intensely).  This implies the sun is high in the sky for a longer duration.
* **The Northern Hemisphere's summer** is when the sun is highest in the sky for the longest period.  This aligns with the described high temperatures and intense sunlight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na basanza ya malili makasi ya Hémisphère du Nord** (In the very cold season of the Northern Hemisphere): This is the opposite of what the text describes.
* **B: Na eleko ya kokauka ya Montevideo** (During the rainy season of Montevideo):  The text doesn't focus on rainy seasons, but on high temperatures.
* **D: Na basanza ya eleko ya été ya Montevideo** (During the summer season of Montevideo): While technically correct, option C is broader and more accurate. The text describes the *seasonal* high temperatures, and those high temperatures occur *because* it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere.  Option C highlights the underlying reason for Montevideo's summer conditions.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini mobembo asengeli kokende kotala Montevideo soki bazali ndambo na klima ya malili?","The correct answer is **A: Tango ekomi été na Montevideo**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Montevideo eza na bituka ya likolo ya tropicale; na basanza ya eleko ya molunge, mbala ba temperature ekomaki kino na +30°C.""  This means Montevideo experiences tropical climate with temperatures reaching +30°C.
* Tropical climates have distinct summer and rainy seasons.  High temperatures and humidity (leading to perceived higher temperatures) are characteristic of the summer.
*  The text also mentions ""mbula"" (rain) and ""elanga"" (sun) without distinction, indicating a consistent warm and humid condition.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tango ezali été na Hémisphère du Nord:** This is irrelevant. The climate of one hemisphere doesn't dictate the climate of another.
* **C: Tango ezali saison ya mbula ya Montevideo:** While the text mentions rain, it doesn't specify the rainy season. The high temperatures are the defining characteristic for someone seeking a warm climate.
* **D: Tango ezali hiver na Hémisphère du Nord:**  This is incorrect. Winter in the Northern Hemisphere would be cold, the opposite of what someone seeking a warm climate in Montevideo would desire.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ekozala na boyokani na mosali ya graffiti oyo ayebani mingi, na bokeseni na kobebisama?","The best answer is **A: Makambo ya kosala ba graffiti**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly discusses graffiti.** The entire passage is about graffiti, its history, its prevalence, and the challenges associated with it (e.g., the difficulty in identifying artists, legality).
* **The question asks what the observed phenomena relate to.** The observed phenomena (the artist's unique style, the use of aerosols, the difficulty in identification) all directly relate to the *act of doing graffiti*.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kokoma na makomi (Dealing with authorities):** While there *might* be issues with authorities, the passage's core focus isn't on dealing with them, but on the artistic and social aspects of graffiti itself.
* **C: Ba fresques oyo elingi te na biloko ya leta (Murals that don't please the government):** This is related, but less direct. Graffiti *can* be viewed as murals that don't please the government, but the passage is broader than just government disapproval.
* **D: Ba étiquettes oyo ekoki kotangama te (Labels that cannot be identified):**  While the passage mentions the difficulty in identifying artists (due to the lack of labels), this is a *consequence* of the graffiti, not the graffiti itself.

Therefore, option A is the most comprehensive and accurate answer.
"
Likambo nini ya bafɛti ya miziki oyo bayangani mosusu batalelaka lokola eteni ya ntina mingi mpo na likambo yango?,"The correct answer is **A: Komema bana mike** (Having young children).

The text states: ""Bafeti misusu ezalaka na bisika ya ntina ya camping mpona bana oyo eza na bana ya mike."" which translates to ""Many artists are at camping areas for children who have young children."" This indicates that artists with young children often choose camping spots for their events.  The question asks why artists might prefer quieter locations. Having young children is a likely reason they'd seek a quieter environment.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Kosala kaa na esika yango** (Setting up camp in the same location): The text doesn't explicitly say this is a reason for quieter locations.
* **C: Musiquei ezali kobɛta tii na butu makasi** (Music is playing very loudly): The text states the opposite – that music is *not* the main factor in quieter locations.
* **D: Kokota liboso ya ngonga** (Avoiding crowded places): While likely a factor, the text specifically links quieter locations with artists having young children.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini mosali ya festival asengeli kotya na esika ya liboso soki alingi kosala camp pene na miziki?","The correct answer is **C: Kosala camp libanda ya esika yango (Camp further away from the main area)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many people camp in designated camping areas for families with young children.  It also warns that the sound of the music can be very loud. Therefore, to avoid being directly in the loudest part of the festival and potentially disturbed by the noise, you should camp further away.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kokende na butu makasi (Go to the very front):** This would be *more* exposed to the loud music, not less.
* **B: Kofanda na esika oyo ezali mpo na mabota (Go to the area for children):** While this might be quieter, the passage doesn't say it's a good place to camp, it's simply mentioned as an option for families with young children.
* **D: Kokota liboso ya ngonga (Stay up all night):**  This isn't a practical solution to the noise problem.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi bapaya basengeli kokima tango bazali koluka bomoi ya butu na nord ya Nouveau-Mexique?","The correct answer is **B: Babare ya bamboka ya mike (Small towns)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while many pueblos are not centers of economic activity, small towns in northern New Mexico are increasingly becoming places where people who are struggling to make a living are forced to go. It specifically mentions the lack of opportunities and the need to travel further for work compared to the casino areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bapueblos (Pueblos):** The passage explicitly states that many pueblos are *not* economic centers.
* **C: Ba centres commerciaux (Commercial centers):** The passage focuses on the lack of economic activity in pueblos and the increasing importance of small towns, not commercial centers.
* **D: Bacasino (Casinos):** The passage mentions that casinos are centers of activity, but also highlights that people are moving *away* from them due to the lack of opportunities and longer commute times.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi mopaya akoki kozwa masano oyo eyebani mingi na nord ya Nouveau-Mexique?","The correct answer is **C: Na casino moko pene na Santa Fe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while casinos are common in Albuquerque, many of the *most* lucrative casinos are located near Santa Fe. It also points out that the northern part of New Mexico has a higher concentration of casinos and a greater need for drivers to transport gamblers.  Therefore, a casino *near Santa Fe* is the most likely place where a significant amount of money is being made.



"
Bato oyo basalaka mibembo oyo bayebaka budget bakoki kolinga kokima lolenge nini ya masanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Vin ya Australie**.

The text states: ""Mai ya robinet ya mboka eza malamu mpenza mpona komela, kasi eza pete na kozwa mai ya milangi soki ozobanga. Mpona bato ya Australie, likanisi ya kafe 'ya mindele' eza ya sika."" This implies that wine from Australia is a more budget-friendly option compared to French wine, which is mentioned as requiring a significant investment. The other options are either explicitly stated as expensive (French wine) or not directly related to budget considerations in the text."
"Na kotalela esika oyo elobelami na mokapo yango, na ba commandes ya masanga oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kobulunganisa serveur moko?","The correct answer is **A: Moindo moko ya mokuse**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mpona bato ya Australie, likanisi ya kafe 'ya mindele' eza ya sika. Ya moindo ya mokuse eza 'expresso'."" This directly links ""moindo ya mokuse"" (espresso) to Australian coffee culture.

The question asks what the server can use to *identify* a particular order.  While the other options describe drinks, the espresso is specifically mentioned as a key differentiator for Australian coffee.  The server can easily identify an espresso order based on this cultural context.
"
"Eumelaki bikeke misato, eleko ya colonisation ebandaki na groupe nini?","The correct answer is **D: Bato ya Espagne**.

The text states: ""Bato ya Espagne babandaki eloko ya kokonza oyo eumelaki bikeke misato."" which translates to ""The people of Spain started the endeavor that entailed two stages."" This directly indicates that the Spanish were responsible for the colonization.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, moyen nini ya malamu ya kosala que parisien a chauffer yo?","The correct answer is **A: Meka ko imiter ezaleli ya Paris** (Mimic Parisian etiquette).

Here's why:

The text states that to be accepted in Paris, you need to imitate the Parisian style and ""act like a Parisian"" (babokola malamu).  This directly aligns with mimicking their behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Bimisa elikya** (Understanding the language): While helpful, the text focuses more on behavior than language.
* **C: acte ya politesse** (Act of politeness):  While etiquette *is* about politeness, the text emphasizes a broader imitation of Parisian *style* and mannerisms, not just individual polite acts.
* **D: Lakisa bizaleli ya libanda** (Mimic social customs): This is similar to A, but ""ezaleli ya Paris"" (Parisian etiquette) is more specific and directly mentioned in the text.

Therefore, mimicking Parisian etiquette is the best way to ""chauffer"" (warm up) a Parisian's approval, according to the passage."
"Nakotala oyo eleki, nini na oyo elandi etalelami te lokola bizaleli oyo ba Parisien bazalaka na yango mingi?","The correct answer is **A: Lolendo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...lolenge ya malamu ya kozala malamu na Paris eza kaka ya kozala na **bizaleli malamu**, kosala makambo neti moto moko """"akola malamu"""" (babokola malamu).""  This translates to: ""...the key to being well-received in Paris is only to be **polite**, to do things and be a person who is ""polite"" (they are polite).""

The text contrasts ""lolendo"" (politeness) with other things like eating well, being elegant, and admiring beauty. While those things are appreciated, the central point is that *politeness* is the most crucial factor for positive interactions.  Therefore, ""lolendo"" (politeness) is the thing the speaker emphasizes as *not* being as important as the other elements mentioned.



"
Litomba nini ezali na Esika ya Liboso na Cape Town MetroRail?,"The correct answer is **B: Bato mingi lokola te (Not very crowded)**.

Here's why:

The text states that MetroPlus (formerly First Class) is ""kitoko mingi mpe na bato mingi te"" which translates to ""very extensive and not very crowded.""  Metro (formerly Third Class) is described as being more crowded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Molakisi azali liboso ya train (The conductor is always on the train):** The text doesn't mention the presence of conductors.
*   **C: Ezali na ntalo moke koleka tike ya Classe ya Misato (It is more expensive than a Third Class ticket):** The text doesn't provide any information about ticket prices.
*   **D: Ezali na ntalo moko na billet ya Metro (It is the same price as a Metro ticket):**  The text doesn't mention ticket prices for MetroPlus.

Therefore, based solely on the provided text, the only accurate statement about the Esika ya Liboso (likely referring to MetroPlus) is that it's not very crowded."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, engunduka nionso ya komema batu na Cap Town ezalaka na nini?","The correct answer is **B: Ntalo ya billet ndenge moko mpo na bisikanionso mibale**.

Here's why:

The text states that MetroRail has two classes: MetroPlus and Metro. Both use the same buses. The key takeaway is that the buses serve the entire MetroRail system. This implies a single ticketing system is used to access all parts of the MetroRail network.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Molakisi ya Metro oyo etondi na bato mingi te:** While MetroPlus is described as less crowded, this doesn't define the *entire* ticketing system.
*   **C: Bakelasi misato ekeseni:** The text mentions two *classes* (MetroPlus and Metro), but not two *ticket types*.
*   **D: Balakisi ya liboso mpe ya misato:** The text doesn't provide enough information to determine if there are different types of tickets for different frequencies of use.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion from the provided text is that there's a single ticket system covering all buses within the MetroRail system.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi nyama mabe ekoki kosala te?","The correct answer is **A: Kopesa kobeba ya poso ya nzoto (Giving a weak dose of vaccine)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that basalaka (vaccines) can cause side effects, but often they are not severe.**  The passage then mentions potential consequences like allergic reactions, infections, or serious illness.
* **The question asks where the ""mabe"" (bad) animal can act.**  ""Mabe"" in this context likely refers to the potential negative effects of the vaccine.
* **Giving a weak dose of vaccine (Kopesa kobeba ya poso ya nzoto) is a way to minimize those negative effects.** It's a preventative measure to avoid severe consequences.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kosilikisa ba allergie (Treating allergies):**  Treating allergies is a response to a symptom, not something the ""mabe"" animal *does*.
* **C: Kopanza infection (Starting an infection):**  While a potential side effect, the passage implies this is rare. The question asks where the ""mabe"" animal *acts* – what effect it has.
* **D: Kpesa mpota oyo ekokaki kozala te (Causing a disease that can be avoided):**  The passage focuses on how basalaka can cause issues, but the primary goal of the vaccine is to prevent diseases.  This option doesn't directly relate to the potential negative *actions* of the vaccine itself.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
Epai wapi bakoki kosomba bakarte ya telefone oyo efutami liboso?,"The correct answer is **C: Na babutike ya pembeni** (At corner stores).

Here's why:

* **The question asks where you can buy phone cards that are frequently used.** The passage states people buy these cards at corner stores to have a low-cost way to call many other phones.
* **The other options are less likely:**
    * **A: Na bikolo oyo eyebani (In the market):** While possible, it's not the primary location mentioned for frequently used phone cards.
    * **B: Na bisika ya kotelema ya engunduka (At the airport):** Airports aren't typically the first place people go to buy phone cards for regular use.
    * **D: Na esika ya kofuta telefone (At the phone repair shop):** Phone repair shops don't usually sell phone cards.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical answer based on the information provided in the text."
Lifuti malamu oyo bacarte mosusu ya telephone epesaka ezalaka ndenge nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Na nzela ya motango ya ofele (Using an operator's switchboard)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how people use operator switches to connect to many different phone numbers. This is the historical method of connecting calls to various destinations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bakoki kozwa yango kaka na bikolo eyebana (They can only do it with a hand switch):** This is too specific and doesn't reflect the broader concept of operator switches.
*   **C: Na butike ya pembeni (At a nearby shop):**  This implies buying something, which isn't the core action described.
*   **D: Na kosalelaka telefone oyo efutaka mpe kofuta mbongo mosusu (By using a malfunctioning phone and deleting the memory):** This is irrelevant to the topic of connecting to multiple phone numbers.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, banzete nini kati na banzete oyo elandi ezali mingi te na Parc national ya Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **C: Sapin**.

The text states: ""Parke national ya Plitvice bakata banzete na yango mingi, mingimingi ba hêtres, ba pinettes pe banzete babengi sapins..."" which translates to ""Plitvice National Park has many forests, many beeches, firs, and pines dominate...""  This indicates that pines (sapins) are a dominant type of tree in the park, even if beeches and firs are also present.  The question asks which tree is *most* abundant.



"
"Na banyama oyo emonanaka mingi te, oyo wapi ekoki kozwama na parke national ya Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **B: Tétra monene**.

The text explicitly mentions ""tétras monene"" (European lynx) as one of the animals found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dindon** (Turkey) - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Cassowary** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Tétra monene** - This is listed twice, and while it *is* correct, the question asks to choose *from the options*, implying a single correct choice. Therefore, B is the best and most concise answer."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bakoode ya esika esalisaka mpenza na nini?","The correct answer is **D: Kosala kopi oyo elandi mibeko te (Copying that doesn't have restrictions)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kotia na diske moko biloko nyonso oyo eza na diske ya solo ekobeta kaka lokola oyo ya solo.""  This translates to: ""Putting everything from a single disk onto another disk only copies it as it already is.""  This implies that the copying isn't restricted or protected in any way.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosala kopi na disque (Copying to a disk):** While true, this is too general. The text highlights that the *type* of copy is important – it's an unrestricted copy.
* **B: Kolanda nkita (Transferring/Moving data):** This isn't the central point of the text.  The focus is on the lack of restrictions during copying.
* **C: Kopekisa koyiba nzembo ya batu mosusu (Copying to steal other people's intellectual property):** The text *doesn't* say the copying is for illegal purposes.  It simply notes that the lack of restrictions makes it easy to copy any data.  It's about the ease and lack of control, not necessarily the intent.



Therefore, option D most accurately reflects the meaning of the provided text."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi na oyo elandi ezali lokuta sur ba codes ya région ezali perpétué na ba entreprises ya médias?","The correct answer is **C: Bazali na ntina mpo na kobalusa mbongo**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Mokano na yango eza ya kopesa bakompani wana boyangeli mingi na bazando; eza kaka makambo ya mbongo.""  This translates to ""The benefit of it is to give these companies a lot of profit from the masses; it's just a matter of money.""

The question asks where the codes of region are perpetuated in media companies.  Since the text emphasizes the *profit* derived from this practice (""makambo ya mbongo"" - a matter of money), the answer must relate to financial gain. Option C directly addresses this by stating that media companies are perpetuating the codes for **profit (kobalusa mbongo)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazali na ntina mpo na kozwa bokonzi mingi na zando** (They are trying to create a large organization on the internet) - While this might be a secondary effect, the primary focus of the text is on financial gain, not internet organization.
* **B: Basalisaka mpo na koboya kosala bakopi oyo eyokani te na mibeko** (They are releasing them to avoid making copies that are not compliant with regulations) - The text doesn't suggest an attempt to avoid regulations; it highlights the *benefit* of this practice, regardless of regulations.
* **D: Basalisaka mingi te mpo na kopekisa piraterie** (They don't release them much to facilitate piracy) - The text explicitly says piracy is a *matter of money* and benefits companies financially. It doesn't say they restrict access to prevent piracy.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly supported by the text."
"Ntango okokóma na mboka na yo, mbala mingi mosala nini esalemaka na ndenge ya momeseno te?","The correct answer is **D: Kolanda makambo ya duane (Clearing customs)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""Kolandela makambo ya douane ekoki kozala motungisi monene."" (Clearing customs can be a big problem/obstacle).
* **The question asks:** ""Ntango okokóma na mboka na yo, mbala mingi mosala nini esalemaka na ndenge ya momeseno te?"" (When you are in a foreign country, what is often the most difficult thing?).
* **Clearing customs (kolanda makambo ya duane)** is a common and often complex process when entering a foreign country, making it a difficult hurdle.

The other options are less relevant:

* **A: Kotala makambo ya immigration (Dealing with immigration)** is also important, but the prompt specifically mentions customs.
* **B: Kosakola biloko (Buying things)** is a possible activity, but not inherently difficult.
* **C: Bandelo ya mibeko ya biloko (The rules of things)** is too general and doesn't specifically address a major difficulty.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi osengeli koyeba liboso ya kokóma na mboka na yo?","The correct answer is **A: Soki okolandela makambo ya douane**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""In the things mentioned, where must you know the deadline to take action?""
* **The text states:** ""Kolandela makambo ya douane ekoki kozala motungisi monene."" (Following customs procedures can be very beneficial.)
* **Therefore, the deadline to take action related to customs procedures is *when* you are following those procedures.**

Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the text as the primary deadline. Option A is the only one directly linked to the benefit mentioned in the passage.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ebele ya biloko oyo epesaka nzela na bato oyo bamataka bangomba bázwa ntango nyonso banzela ya sika na kati ya Lobwaku ya Cochamó?","The correct answer is **D: Bifelo (Bison)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Bato ya bamboka nyonso oyo bamataka balandaka kosala banzela ya sika na kati oyo bifelo oyo ezanga suka."" (All the people who come to dance have discovered a sacred place in the middle where bison that are always running are.)

Therefore, the bison are the key element that draws people to this sacred spot and the reason for the dances. The question asks what *makes* people dance, and the text explicitly states it's the bison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Makanisi (Mechanics):**  The text has nothing to do with mechanics.
* **B: Bikita (Baskets):** Baskets are not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Ya likolo (Of the moon):** The text doesn't mention the moon.



"
"Na kotalela makambo oyo epesami na mokapo yango, nani azali kolobela bisika oyo bakatisi mingi na Hémisphère Sud?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

The text explicitly states: ""Boyokani moko te ya likolo esalisaka na kokokatisa bambu nyonso misato na hémisphère ya sudi (mpe SkyTeam esalisaka na kokatisa ata moko te). Kasi, Star Alliance ezwaka eteni wana mobimba longola Pacifique ya sudi este banda na Santiago ya Chilie kino Tahiti..."" This means Star Alliance is the one that flies the most across the Southern Hemisphere.
"
Alliance nini ya ba compagnies aériennes ezo couvrir kokatisa ya océan moke na Hémisphère du Sud?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

The text explicitly states: ""Boyokani moko te ya likolo esalisaka na kokokatisa bambu nyonso misato na hémisphère ya sudi (mpe SkyTeam esalisaka na kokatisa ata moko te). Kasi, Star Alliance ezwaka eteni wana mobimba longola Pacifique ya sudi este banda na Santiago ya Chilie kino Tahiti...""  This translates to: ""Only one alliance tries to cover the entire Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam doesn't even try to cover it at all). But, Star Alliance cleverly covers the South Pacific up to Santiago de Chile or Tahiti...""

Therefore, Star Alliance is the alliance mentioned as covering the Southern Hemisphere.
"
Ebongiseli nini ya kotambola elongaki Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **C: Running Tours Prague**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is mentioned as an example of Global Running Tours' network. The text explicitly states: ""Lokola eza na misisa na Running Tours Barcelona na Barcelone pe Running Copenhagen na Copenhague, mosusu esanganaki noki na yango na ndakisa **Running Tours Prague oyo eza na Prague mpe misusu**.""  This directly points to Running Tours Prague as a key part of their network.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, Go Running Tours esalisaka mpo na kokangisa bibongiseli boni ya ndenge na ndenge ya sightrunning?","The answer is **A: Minei**.

The text states: ""Go Running Tours asali réseau eza na bafournisseur mingi ya sightrunning na bakontina minei."" This translates to ""Go Running Tours has a network of many sightrunning providers in various continents."" ""Minei"" means ""many"" in Lingala.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: 200:** This refers to the number of guides, not the number of providers.
* **C: douzaines:** This means ""dozens,"" which is not supported by the text.
* **D: Misato:** This means ""three,"" which is irrelevant to the question."
Touriste asengeli kosala nini soki azali na elikya ya komona guépard polele soki likoki ezali?,"The correct answer is **A: Kende na safari ya kotambola na bangomba**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Banyama mosusu, na ndakisa banzoku na badikala, balingaka kopusa mpenza pene ya mituka pe bisaleli ebongi ekosalisa na komona malamu."" (Many animals, along with their young, like to hide in the bushes and avoid being seen.  The observer needs to be very patient and observant to see them.)
* **It also mentions:** ""Kotambola ya safari (oyo babengaka mpe """"kotambola na esobe"""", """"koleka na safari"""", to kokende """"na mokolo"""") ezalaka kotambola ya mwa bangonga to ya mikolo mingi."" (Going on safari (which they also call ""walking safari,"" ""going on safari,"" or ""going for a day"") is a walk of several hours.)

Guépards are known for being elusive and hiding.  A walking safari (or a longer day safari) increases your chances of spotting them because you are actively searching and moving through their habitat.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kende kotambola na zamba:** While you *might* see a guépard from a vehicle, it's not the most effective method. They are masters of camouflage.
* **C: Salela ba jumelles:** Binoculars are helpful for *seeing* a guépard once you spot it, but don't increase your chances of *finding* it in the first place.
* **D: Zwá motuka mpe salelá bisaleli oyo bizali na momeseno:**  While a vehicle safari is an option, the text emphasizes patience, observation, and walking through the habitat – skills more readily developed on a walking safari.



"
"Nakotala oyo eleki, na banyama oyo balandi, nyama nini mopaya akoki kokutana na yango ntango azali kosala mobembo na safari na motuka?","The correct answer is **D: bankoi ya nzoto peto ya mike**.

The text states: ""Bankoi ya nkozi ya zamba, bankoi ya nzoto peto ya **mike** mpe bankoi ya nzoto peto ya minene bazalaka mingi na kobanga mpe okomona yango malamu soki olati maneti ya minene.""

This translates to: ""Leopard, small monkeys and big monkeys are often seen and observed if you get out of the car.""

Therefore, small monkeys are a potential animal encounter during a safari.
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nini ekokaki kokitisa ntalo ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **B: Kozwa etuluku ya bato minei (Inviting many people to the party)**.

Here's why:

* **The original text emphasizes the importance of inviting many people to a party for a more enjoyable and safer atmosphere.** It states that having a large group can deter potential troublemakers.
* **Option B directly reflects this idea.** 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kokende yo moko (Staying to yourself):** This is the opposite of what the text suggests for a good party.
* **C: Kokende na moto mosusu moko (Inviting just one more person):** While adding a person is good, it doesn't achieve the same level of safety and a lively atmosphere as inviting many.
* **D: Kozwa etuluku ya bato motoba to koleka (Inviting a large crowd):** This is not directly supported by the text, which focuses on a good number of people, not necessarily a massive crowd that might be difficult to manage. The text is more about creating a safe and enjoyable environment through a sufficient number of guests.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani akozala na likoki ya kozwa motuya ya mobembo oyo eleki malamu?","The correct answer is **B: Etuluku ya bato misato (Group of three people)**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes a situation where people are going to great lengths to hide and conceal their possessions.** This suggests they are trying to avoid being noticed by thieves.
* **The text states that it's important to be cautious and warn people to be careful with their belongings.** This implies a risk of theft.
* **The text mentions that people are trying to ""futa mbongo mingi te"" (hide their belongings well).**  This reinforces the idea of a potential theft situation.

Given these points, a group of three people is a plausible size for a small, potentially risky, gathering where people might be trying to be discreet with their valuables.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ba touristes oyo balingi ko mélanger mituka (Tourists who like to mingle):** While tourists *could* be involved, the emphasis on hiding possessions suggests more than just casual mingling.
* **C: Baninga mibale bazali kosala mobembo elongo (Adults are playing a game of hide-and-seek):** This doesn't align with the concern about theft and hiding valuables.
* **D: Etuluku ya bato mitano (Group of five people):**  A group of five might be too large for the scenario described, and could make it harder for individuals to discreetly hide their belongings.



Therefore, the most logical answer, based on the context, is a group of three people."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esalaki ete San Francisco endimama na mokili mobimba?","The correct answer is **A: Kozala mbala na mbala na mitindo ndenge na ndenge ya mayemi mpe ya bapanzi-nsango (Being a place of diverse and artistic trends)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ndenge balakisaka yango mbala mingi na miziki, na bafilme, na babuku mpe na makambo ya bokoko esalisa mpo engumba mpe bamonima na yango eyebana na mokili mobimba."" (They often express themselves through music, movies, books, and other art forms, and people are drawn to it and connected to it.)
* **The passage highlights:** San Francisco's reputation as a place for artists and a hub for diverse cultures (Asia, etc.).  This diversity fuels artistic expression.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bisika ya mayangani ya malamu mpenza (A place of very lenient laws):** While San Francisco might have a progressive attitude, the passage doesn't emphasize lenient laws as the primary reason for its connection to the avant-garde.
* **C: Bokeseni ya nkita (The boldness of the government):** The passage doesn't discuss government boldness.
* **D: Esika moko ya bilei ya Asie oyo ezali se kokola (A unique place in Asia that is not just a city):**  While San Francisco *is* a unique place in Asia (as mentioned in the passage), the answer is not about it being a unique place *in Asia* itself, but *why* it connects to the avant-garde.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **A: Esili komonana mbala mingi na bafilme mpe na babuku (It's often seen in movies and books).**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ndenge balakisaka yango mbala mingi na miziki, na bafilme, na babuku mpe na makambo ya bokoko esalisa mpo engumba mpe bamonima na yango eyebana na mokili mobimba."" (They often express it through music, movies, books, and other things that are used for entertainment and they are familiar with it through the world.)

This directly supports option A, which highlights the frequent representation of San Francisco in media like films and books.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Bilei ya Asie epalangani mingi (Asian diversity is very high):** While the text mentions San Francisco's Asian diversity, it doesn't say it's *high* or a unique characteristic that makes it ""solo te"" (not the only one). Many cities have Asian populations.
* **C: Ba hotels mpe bisika ya mayangani ezali mingi (There are many hotels and tourist spots):** The text mentions hotels and tourist spots, but it doesn't position this as something exclusive to San Francisco. Many tourist destinations have hotels.
* **D: Nkita etie motema mobimba na tourisme (The government is extremely focused on tourism):** The text mentions tourism but doesn't state that the government is *extremely focused* on it.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mosali mobembo nini akoki kozwa matomba te soki asaleli misala ya agent ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **C: Mosali mobembo oyo azwi naino visa na ye te**.

Here's why:

The text states that to book accommodation and transportation (airport transfers, hotel/camping), you need to contact the **travel agency**, not the hotel directly.  The question asks why the travel agent might not be able to help. The most logical reason is that the travel agent might not have the necessary visa information or be authorized to handle visa-related issues for the traveler.  They handle bookings and logistics, but visa matters are often handled separately or require specific expertise.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Mosali mobembo ayebi mpenza te oyo alingi:** This is too general. A travel agent *should* understand what you want to travel to.
* **B: Mosali mobembo oyo azali na momeseno ya kosala makambo na mbalakaka:** While possible, it's less directly related to why they might not be able to assist with the specific issue outlined in the text.
* **D: Mosali mobembo oyo alingaka mingi kosala réservation ya boyokani:** This is a possible reason, but again, not as directly tied to the information provided in the text regarding visa requirements.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo lokola litomba ya kosala réservation na nzela ya agent ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **D: Kosimba réservation (Making a reservation)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngai esengeli kosalema na nzela ya kompani ya mobembo kasi te na nzela ya hotel."" This translates to ""I must make a reservation through the travel agency, not through the hotel.""  Therefore, ""kosimba réservation"" (making a reservation) is what's *allowed* and what the question is asking about, implying the other options are incorrect.

Here's why the other options are wrong:

* **A: Mikanda ya mobembo oyo esalemi nokinoki (Travel agency forms are not available):** The text doesn't say forms are unavailable, it says reservations should be made *through* the agency.
* **B: Boyokani ya hotel (Hotel booking):** The text specifically prohibits booking through the hotel.
* **C: Kofuta biloko nionso (Cancelling everything):**  This is unrelated to making a reservation and not mentioned in the text.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali na makoki te ya baprograme ya kobongola makomi na tango ya solo?","The correct answer is **B: Kobongola biteni mobimba ya makomi (Translating large amounts of text)**.

Here's why:

The text states that translation apps can translate ""biteni milai ya maloba ya lokota moko na lokota mosusu"" which translates to ""large amounts of text from one language to another.""  It also mentions that many translation applications are not completely accurate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kobongola bilembo na minoko ya bapaya (Translating legal documents):** While translation apps *can* be used for legal documents, the text doesn't specifically highlight this as a limitation. It focuses more on the overall challenge of translating large amounts of text.
*   **C: Kobongola makomi na biloko na nzela ya smartphone (Translating text using smartphone features):** The text mentions that translation apps utilize smartphone features, so this isn't a limitation *of* the apps themselves.
*   **D: Kobongola malamu 100% ya tango (Achieving 100% accuracy in translation):** The text explicitly states that translation apps are often not 100% accurate (""pe sikoyo ebongalaka na ndenge ya mwa malamu (pe mbala mingi te buzoba)""). This is a known limitation of machine translation.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **B**.



"
Nini epesaka nzela na kobongola mabongoli na nzela ya Internet te?,"The correct answer is **A: Basini ya kobongola oyo ebongisami** (Translation apps).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Moko ya ba application ya ntina mingi ya ndenge wana eza Google Translate, oyo esalisaka na kobongola makambo ata oza te na internet nsima ya kozwa basango nyonso ya lokota olingi.""  This means translation apps are the ones that enable translation without internet access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Smartphones:** Smartphones *can* be used with translation apps, but they aren't the primary mechanism for enabling offline translation.
* **C: Kozwa bansango ya lokota (Downloading dictionaries):** While downloading dictionaries is a *method* of enabling offline translation, the text refers to the apps themselves.
* **D: Baapplication oyo ezali kati na ba oyo ekosalisa nan tango ekokani (Apps that communicate with each other):** This is too general. While translation apps *might* communicate with other apps, that isn't what makes them enable offline translation.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali te likambo oyo ebimisaka ba avalanches?","The correct answer is **A: Neige oyo ekangamaka (Snow that is sliding)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that avalanches are caused by snow that is sliding and unstable. It describes how the snow layers interact and shift, leading to a mass movement of snow down the slope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Batu (People):** While people can *trigger* an avalanche, they are not the fundamental cause. The snow conditions must be right for an avalanche to occur.
*   **C: Kongenga ya moyi (Wind):** Wind can influence snow accumulation and create unstable conditions, but it's not the primary cause of an avalanche.
*   **D: Neige oyo ebakisami (Snow that has settled):** Settled snow is generally more stable than sliding snow. The instability is what triggers the avalanche.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na oyo elandi ekiti lokola ba avalanches?","The correct answer is **C: Motango ya neige oyo eleki na mabwaku ya kotelema makasi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes avalanches as resulting from the accumulation of snow in steep slopes.** The passage explicitly states ""Mokakatano eza ete neige eza ya kokangama, yango wana esengeli ata ndambu ekwea na se, mpe soki ndambu ya neige ekiti na se, ekoki kobenda oyo etikali."" (The resistance is that snow is accumulating, which is why it shouldn't even cover the ground, and if a snowdrift accumulates, it can collapse).
* **Avalanches are a direct consequence of this accumulation on steep terrain.** This fits perfectly with option C which describes snow accumulating on steep slopes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Neige ya kokangama oyo ebimi te** (Snow that is not compact): While loosely related, this doesn't specifically describe avalanches.
* **B: Mabwaku oto etelemi makasi ya mabangamabanga oyo ezangi neige** (Snowdrifts are formed by very strong gusts of wind): Wind can contribute to snowdrifts, but it's not the primary cause of avalanches.
* **D: Neige oyo batu basimbi yango te** (Snow that people haven't touched): This is irrelevant to the formation of avalanches.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eloko ya malamu esalemi zingazinga ya biloko nini?","The correct answer is **A: Yaourt na mayi**.

The text states: ""Na bituka oyo eza na kati na nordi ya Inde mpe Pakistan, basalelaka yaourt mbala mingi na bacurries..."" (In the region between northern India and Pakistan, they often use yogurt in curries...).  This directly supports option A. While other ingredients are mentioned, yogurt and water are highlighted as common additions to curries in different regions.
"
"Na bituka mosusu, basalelaka ntango mosusu miliki ya mbila na esika ya eloko nini oyo basalaka na curry?","The correct answer is **B: Bandunda**.

The text states: ""Na bituka oyo eza na kati na nordi ya Inde mpe Pakistan, basalelaka yaourt mbala mingi na bacurries; na sudi ya Inde mpe na bituka mosusu ya pene ya mbu na bamboka, basalelaka mingi miliki ya kokoti."" This translates to: ""In the middle region of northern India and Pakistan, they often add yogurt to curries; in southern India and much of the lower regions, they often add coconut.""

Therefore, in the regions mentioned in the question (""bituka mosusu ya pene ya mbu""), they add **coconut** to their curries.
"
Mpo na nini esengeli bopengwi ezala zingazinga ya bangomba Transantarctique mpo na komata na plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Batraktere ya bomoko mpenza ezalaka makasi te** (Smaller tractors are not powerful enough).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mpo koleka kuna esengaka kosalela batracteurs ebongi, ememaka essence na biloko mosusu. Oyo eninganaka mpenza te yango wana nzela esengeli ekende kobaluka mosika na bangomba ya Transantarcti mpona kokoma na plateau.""  This translates to: ""To get there, it's necessary to use large tractors that use a lot of fuel. This is very expensive, which is why the road has to be built along the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.""

The core problem is that the large tractors needed to maintain the road are too expensive to operate due to their high fuel consumption.  Therefore, smaller, less powerful tractors are inadequate for the task.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gare McMurdo ekangamaka (McMurdo Station is often blocked):** While McMurdo Station can be affected by weather, the main issue discussed is the difficulty of maintaining the road itself.
*   **B: Neige oyo ekangami ezali likama (The snow that accumulates is hard):** The passage mentions snow and ice as obstacles, but it's not the *primary* reason for the problem.
*   **D: Ezali pete koleka kosala mobembo na nzela ya Mbu Ross (It's necessary to make a detour along the Ross Ice Shelf):** The passage explains why a detour is *needed*, not that it's the *cause* of the problem. The detour is a solution to the difficulty of maintaining the road along the Ross Ice Shelf.



"
"Na nzela ya Traverse ya Pôle Sud, nini ezali na bilembo ya ba drapeaux?","The correct answer is **C: Ba crevasses etondi na neige (Crevasses and deep snow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eza neige ya kokangama eza na madusu mpe eza na babendele."" This translates to ""The snow is unstable and has crevasses.""  Therefore, the flags likely mark dangerous crevasses to warn travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nzela oyo ezali na Gare McMurdo (The route is at McMurdo Station):** The passage discusses the route *to* the South Pole, not the location of McMurdo Station itself.
* **B: Ba tracteurs oyo ezali kobenda carburant (The tractors that are refueling):** The passage mentions the difficulty of using tractors due to fuel consumption, but doesn't say the flags relate to refueling.
* **D: Ba deviations ya likama zinga ya bangomba (Lateral deviations from the normal route):** While deviations might occur, the passage primarily emphasizes the danger of the snow and crevasses.



"
Nini elobelami te na mokapo lokola likambo oyo ba touristes basengeli koyeba ntango bazali kotala Afrique ya Sud?,"The correct answer is **A: Bikólo ndenge na ndenge ezali na masengami ndenge na ndenge mpo na kozwa Visa** (Visa requirements are very specific).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the challenges of traveling in South Africa, particularly the need for a reliable vehicle (4x4) and careful planning.**  It highlights the remoteness of some areas and the importance of being prepared.
* **The passage specifically mentions that visas are required and can be complex.**  This is a crucial piece of information for tourists.
* **Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they contradict the passage.** The passage does *not* say that traveling by car is the easiest way to see the country, that the surrounding areas are stable, or that a 4x4 is *recommended* (it's practically necessary).



Therefore, the most important piece of information tourists need to know before visiting South Africa, based on the passage, is the complex visa requirements.
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nini ekotalelama lokola toli ya mabe mpo na ba touristes oyo bazali koluka kotala Afrique ya Sud na motuka?","The correct answer is **C: Kosala mobembo na motuka ezali malamu mingi mpo na baoyo bazali koluka kopengwa na banzela oyo bato mingi basalelaka.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the challenging road conditions in South Africa.** It states that many roads are unpaved and that you need a 4x4 vehicle with specialized tires for certain areas.
* **Option C directly addresses the difficulty of driving on these roads.** It highlights that driving requires a lot of skill and experience, especially for tourists unfamiliar with such conditions. This aligns perfectly with the passage's overall message.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Biloko mosusu ya mbalakaka na kati ya motuka ekoki kosengama na mobeko:** While true, this is a general statement and not the *primary* difficulty faced by tourists, as highlighted in the passage.
* **B: Atako esengeli kokende na 4x4, bisika mingi ekoki kokende na motuka ya momesano:** The passage clarifies that *many* areas require 4x4, but not *all*. It also states that specialized tires are needed, which contradicts the idea that a regular car can handle most roads.
* **D: Mikili nyonso te oyo ezali pembenipembeni ya Afrika ya Sudi ezali malamu mpo na kokende kotala:** The passage explicitly states that many roads *are* challenging, implying that not everything surrounding South Africa is easily accessible.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo yango lokola likama oyo ekoki kobima ya kotika basaki na yo kozanga ete bátalela yo?","The correct answer is **D: Bakonzi bakoki kotalela bango lokola likama oyo ekoki kobwaka bombe na kati.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how scammers (basaki oyo bazokengela te)** exploit people's desire to be seen as knowledgeable. They create fake profiles and use them to build trust and then manipulate victims.
* **The question asks where to report this behavior.**
* **Option D directly addresses this:** it states that authorities (bakonzi) can treat these fake profiles as a platform for manipulating people and potentially causing harm (kobwaka bombe na kati - causing problems/harm). This implies reporting them to law enforcement or relevant authorities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakoki koyiba yango (They can steal it):**  This refers to the fake profiles, not where to report malicious activity *using* those profiles.
* **B: Okoki kokóma moto oyo amemaka bangi kozanga ete oyeba (You can make the person who created them think you know):** This is about *being* manipulated, not reporting the manipulation.
* **C: Bakokaki kobulunganisama na oyo ya moto mosusu (They don't cooperate with other people):** This is irrelevant to reporting fake profiles and malicious activity.



"
Nini elobelami te na mokapo na oyo etali komema bangi?,"The correct answer is **D: Bakonzi bakoki kobotola basaki na yo, ata soki ozali komema bangi te.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...bakonzi bakoki kobotola basaki na yo, ata soki ozali komema bangi te."" ( ""...administrators can get information about you, even if you don't admit it."")
* **The question asks:** ""Nini elobelami te na mokapo na oyo etali komema bangi?"" (What doesn't happen to someone who is trying to hide things?)
* **Option D directly addresses this:**  Even if you try to hide your activities, authorities can still obtain information about you.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na ba pays mosusu, bato oyo basali mabe mpo na mbala ya liboso bakokaki kozwa etumbu ya liwa** (In many countries, people who commit crimes frequently have a criminal record). While related to repeated offenses, it doesn't directly address the passage's point about authorities getting information even if you try to hide it.
* **B: Esengeli kokeba mingi ntango ozali kosala mobembo na mikili mosusu** (You should know a lot when you are engaging in large-scale activities).  This is generally true, but not the primary point being made in the passage.
* **C: Bakokaki kosalela bambwa oyo bamɛlaka bangi kozanga ete báyebisa yango** (They don't have to tell the people they lied to that they know). This focuses on lying, whereas the passage is about hiding activities, not specifically lying.



"
Lolenge nini ya masanga elobelami te lokola eloko ya komeka kosala na ndako ntango ozali na congé?,"The correct answer is **A: Jus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Soki ozomona neti osekisaka bato mingi, zwa libaku ya komela jus to biloko basangisa...""  This translates to: ""If you see that you are helping many people, there are places to get juice or things they offer...""

The question asks what is *not* a good way to express gratitude when on vacation.  While coffee (kafe) and ""ti"" (tea) are mentioned as things people might offer, the passage specifically lists *juice (jus)* as something that might be offered *instead* of coffee or tea.  The passage is implying that having a drink is the expression of gratitude.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kafe (Coffee):**  Mentioned as a thing people might offer, so it is *a* way to express gratitude, not something *not* a way.
* **C: Masanga (Gratitude/Thanks):** The question asks about *how* to express gratitude.  ""Masanga"" *is* gratitude, not a method of expressing it.
* **D: Ti (Tea):** Similar to coffee, it's mentioned as something people might offer.

Therefore, juice is the only option explicitly stated as something *besides* coffee or tea that might be offered as a way to express gratitude.
"
"Na oyo elandi, oyo wapi osengeli kokende kotala na ntango ya kofanda soki engumba na yo eyebani mpo na mimeseno na yango ya komela masanga?","The correct answer is **A: Esika ya komela kafe libanda ya quartier na bino (The coffee shop in your neighborhood)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes coffee shops:** The passage explicitly mentions enjoying coffee and engaging in conversations at a coffee shop. It describes it as a place for relaxation and connection.
* **Option A aligns with the context:**  The prompt asks where to go to relax and connect to combat loneliness. A local coffee shop fits this description perfectly.
* **Other options are less relevant:**
    * **B: Butike ya jus to ya jus esangisami na miliki (A juice shop or juice bar):** While it involves drinks, the focus isn't specifically on a place for social connection and relaxation like a coffee shop.
    * **C: Bisika ya komela masanga wapi okendeke mbala mingi te (A place to meet up where you don't go often):** This is the opposite of what the text suggests. The idea is to find a *regular* place.
    * **D: Bisika ya kolia oyo basalaka ti ya camomille (A tea shop that serves chamomile tea):** Tea shops can be relaxing, but the text's emphasis is on coffee and social interaction, not specifically tea.



Therefore, the coffee shop in your neighborhood is the most suitable option based on the text provided.



"
Mayemi ya bibenga ezali wapi?,"The correct answer is **A: Na ntaka ya ndambo ya ngonga longwa na mboka** (At the base of the long nave of the church).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mboka Haldarsvík esalisaka na komona esanga ya Eysturoy oyo eza pene pe ezalaka na ndako-nzambe moko ya octogonale ya bongobongo. Na nkunda, eza na mayemi ya kitoko ya marbre ya bapizio likolo ya nkunda mosusu. Esengaka katikati ya ngonga moko mpona kotambola na mboka kitoko.""

This translates to: ""The Haldarsvík church is located in the parish of Eysturoy and is built on a single octagonal brick church. On the sides, it has a beautiful marble decoration of rounded arches. It is located in the middle of a long nave for walking in the church.""

The question asks where the architectural feature is located. The text clearly says the marble decoration (the ""mayemi"" - beauty/feature) is ""na nkunda"" (on the sides) and then specifies ""Na ntaka ya ndambo ya ngonga longwa na mboka"" which translates to ""At the base of the long nave of the church"".



"
Lolenge nini ya visa ekoki kosɛnga moto apesa bilembeteli oyo emonisi ete mbongo ekoki?,"The correct answer is **B: Viza mpona kokende kotala mboka mopaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mbala mingi, mpona kotikala na mokili moko ya bapaya na eleko ya molai, ekosenga ozwa viza liboso. Mbala mingi baviza ya bana-kelasi ezalaka na masengami ekeseni mpe lolenge ya kosala yango ekeseni na koluka viza mpona kokende kotala mboka mopaya to mpona mombongo.""

This directly links visas for visiting a ""mboka mopaya"" (hostile country) or for ""mombongo"" (asylum) with the possibility of someone being granted asylum.  The other options are either too broad (visa for tourism) or specifically about student visas.



"
Nani azali na likoki mingi ya kosɛnga visa oyo ebakisami?,"The correct answer is **A: Touriste ya mbala na mbala (Tourists who travel occasionally)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ata soki ekosenga ozwa viza mpona baviziti ya mikuse na bamboka misusu mpona kokende kuna to mpona mombongo..."" which translates to ""Even if it requires a visa for tourist visits and travel for longer periods for sightseeing or for medical reasons..."" This indicates that tourists are among those who might need a visa.

While the other options *could* potentially need visas, the text focuses on tourists as a primary example.
"
Ntango nini osengeli kotya likebi mingimingi na ngungi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ntango ozali kotambwisa motuka (When you are driving a vehicle)**.

Here's why:

The provided text warns about the dangers of tropical and subtropical animals, especially when driving.  It emphasizes caution and the potential for collisions. Option D directly relates to the activity mentioned in the text that poses the greatest risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na ntango ya sanza ya moi makasi (During the hottest part of the day):** While heat can be a factor, it's not the primary danger highlighted in the text.
* **B: Likolo ya komata ngomba (When crossing a river):** Crossing a river isn't specifically mentioned as a risky activity in the text.
* **C: Na zamba ya mbula (During rainfall):** Rain can reduce visibility, but the text's main concern is encountering animals while driving.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, osengeli koboya kosala nini mpo na kokima ngungi ntango ozali kotambwisa motuka na zamba ya mbula?","The correct answer is **A: Kotika baporte ya motuka polele ntango molai mingi (Keep the car's air vents open when it's hot).**

Here's why:

* **The question asks about keeping the engine cool while driving in hot weather.** The passage states that engines can overheat in tropical climates.
* **Keeping the vents open helps to dissipate heat from the engine compartment.**  This is the most direct and common way to prevent overheating.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Koleka na motuka na boumeli ya eleko ya molunge (Drive the car with a tropical coolant).** While using the correct coolant is important, the primary action to take *during* a hot drive is to allow heat to escape.
* **C: Kotambwisa motuka na bisika oyo ezali na mikili ya molunge (Drive the car in shady areas).**  Shade helps, but it doesn't address the heat buildup *within* the engine.
* **D: Kotika motuka kozanga mobateli ntango ozali kotambola na bangomba (Keep the car idling when driving on hills).** Idling actually *increases* heat production in the engine because it's running without the benefit of airflow.

Therefore, keeping the air vents open is the most effective immediate action to take to prevent overheating.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na ba affirmation oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ya solo te.","The correct answer is **C: Ezali ceinture ya mangrove oyo eleki monene na mokili mobimba (It is a large mangrove belt in the delta).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ezalaka kaka te bisika ya bamangroves — ezalaka ndambu ya bisika ya kala oyo etikala ya bazamba ya nguya oyo ezalaki kala na bisika monene ya Gangetic Sundarbans..."" This directly confirms that the Sundarbans is a large mangrove belt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezali ndako ya ba mboloko ya ba tache, mpe baleki ba tigre ya Bengale na ebele (It is a habitat for many tache animals, and tigers of Bengal are found there).** While the passage mentions tigers and mentions it's a habitat for wildlife, it **doesn't** refer to ""tache animals."" This is likely a misunderstanding or translation error.
* **B: Ndambo ya etando na yango mobimba ezipami na mabulu ya mai (The flood season is characterized by water trees).** The passage mentions that a significant portion of the area is underwater, but it **doesn't** specifically describe the flood season in terms of ""water trees.""
* **D: Ezali ndako ya ba mboloko ya ba tache, mpe baleki ba tigre ya Bengale na ebele (It is a habitat for tache animals, and tigers of Bengal are found there).**  Same issue as option A - the term ""tache animals"" isn't used in the passage.



Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the information provided in the passage."
Eteni nini ya zamba ezali na kati ya teritware ya Inde?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National Park**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bazamba eza kaka te bisika ya bamangroves — ezalaka ndambu ya bisika ya kala oyo etikala ya bazamba ya nguya oyo ezalaki kala na bisika monene ya Gangetic Sundarbans ezalaki na esika ya 3 850 km², pe eteni moko na kati ya biteni na yango misato ezala na mai/potopoto. **Banda na 1966 baSundarbans ezalaki esika ya kofanda ya banyama ya zamba, mpe bato bakanisaka ete sikoyo eza na batigre 400 na Royal ya Bengale mpe pene ya bambuli 30 000 ya matonomatono na etuka wana. Sundarbans National Park**"" This indicates that the area within India where Sundarbans is protected is called Sundarbans National Park.

"Kolandana na bokomi, nani azali na likoki mingi ya kozala na bososoli ata moke ya monoko ya anglais?","The correct answer is **B: Bato oyo bazali bilenge na mbula (People who are fluent in multiple languages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many people speak English as a second language. The ability to speak multiple languages makes it *less likely* someone will be completely unfamiliar with English. Someone who speaks multiple languages has likely encountered and learned aspects of English already.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Bato oyo balobaka ata minoko mosusu mibale (People who only speak a few words):** This is the *most* likely to be completely unfamiliar with English.
* **C: Bato oyo bazali kosala mobembo na Toronto (People who are studying in Toronto):** Studying in Toronto doesn't guarantee fluency in English, especially if they are just *studying* and not integrated into the community.
* **D: Bato oyo bakómi mikóló na mbula (People who have lived in Toronto for a long time):**  Living somewhere for a long time doesn't automatically make someone fluent in English; they may have learned English as a second language.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kozala mpasi mpo na kobenga yango?","The best answer is **C: Maloba oyo ekomami (The language used)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the diverse languages used in the conversations.** It specifically mentions English, but also notes that many people are learning it and that some people speak it with a variety of accents. The core problem seems to stem from the difficulty in understanding *what* people are saying because of the language variations.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Maloba na baaccent ekeseni (The different accents of the language):** While accents are a factor, the passage doesn't focus on *different accents* as the primary problem. It highlights the difficulty even when people are speaking the *same* language (English) with different accents.
* **B: Baadresi (Addresses):** Addresses are irrelevant to the communication problem described.
* **D: Maloba ya kati ya mboka (The middle ground of the conversation):** This is too vague. The passage doesn't point to a specific point in the conversation as the issue.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the core problem is the **language used** and the resulting difficulties in understanding.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eteni nini ekozala malamu mpo na mobembo oyo azali kokana kozwa mutuka uta na esika ememaka ya kati na district?","The correct answer is **A: Moto oyo azali kosala mobembo azali kokende na Jakar mpe asilá kosomba tike liboso.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Babisi elongwaka na esika oyo ekangaka (na ngambo mosusu ya ebale) mokolo mobimba, atako mbala mingi, mingimingi oyo ekendaka na este pe na Jakar/Bumthang..."" (Buses depart early in the morning (usually at around 6:30 or 7:30) to Este and Jakar/Bumthang...).
* **It also mentions:** ""...ezalaka malamu kosomba tike mwa mikolo liboso."" (...it's advisable to book tickets in advance).

Therefore, the person conducting the survey is likely traveling to Jakar and needs to book a ticket early. Options B, C, and D don't align with the information provided in the passage. Option B mentions Bumthang and a 7:00 AM wake-up, which isn't directly supported. Option C refers to Paro and an 11:00 AM wake-up, which is also not explicitly mentioned. Option D mentions Este and a 6:20 AM arrival at the station, which doesn't fit the described bus schedule to Jakar/Bumthang.



"
Nini ekozala toli malamu mpo na touriste oyo azali koluka kosala mobembo na est longwa na esika ememaka ya kati na district?,"The correct answer is **B: Somba tike ya liboso (Buy a daily pass)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mbala mingi, babisi oyo ekendaka na bituka ezalaka ya kotonda, yango wana ezalaka malamu kosomba tike mwa mikolo liboso."" This translates to ""Often, the buses that go to the attractions are crowded, therefore it is advisable to buy a daily pass.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mituka elongwaka kaka nsima ya 8:30 (Buses only run before 8:30 am):** The passage says buses run between 6:30 and 7:30 am. This is incorrect.
* **C: Mitukas mingi elongwaka mokolo mobimba (Many buses run on the weekend):** The passage doesn't explicitly state this, though it mentions the weekend is a popular time to visit.  The focus is on the crowdedness of buses.
* **D: Taxi oyo bakabolaka ekoki kozala nzela ya mayele koleka mpo na kosala mobembo (Taxis you can hire can be a faster way to explore):** While taxis *can* be faster, the passage mentions buses are a common and affordable way to get to Paro and Punakha. It also emphasizes the crowdedness of the buses, suggesting the daily pass might be a better option than relying solely on taxis.



Therefore, the daily pass is the most practical solution for a tourist wanting to explore the area, considering the crowded bus situation.



"
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ndimbola ya sikisiki ya Timbuktu te?","The correct answer is **A: Ezali na influence mingi ya Arabe koleka mboka mobimba** (It has a strong Arab influence despite being deep in the continent).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ezalaki kati na bitambe ya ntina mingi na likambo ya ntina ya Henry Louis Gates etali makamwisi ya Mikili ya Afrika. **Ezalaki na bokeseni makasi na bingumba mosusu ya mboka wana, mpo aza na mayele migi ya baarabe kasi ya bato ya Afrika te.**"" (It is among the most important treasures in Henry Louis Gates' documentary about the African Enlightenment. **It is very deep in the continent, but has Arab influences despite being of African people.**)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ezali na bobola** (It is inaccessible) - The text says it *has* an airport (""eza na aeroport"").
* **C: Ezali inaccessible na avion** (It is inaccessible by plane) -  Contradicted by the presence of an airport.
* **D: Ezalaki kaka esika oyo ebendaka bato oyo balingaka koyeba makambo mingi** (It was only a place where people who wanted to learn a lot went) - While historically important, the text doesn't limit its significance to just those seeking knowledge. It highlights its cultural and intellectual importance.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali solo?","The correct answer is **C: Ezali na mayele ya Afrika mingi te koleka bingumba oyo ezali zingazinga**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Engumba eza na bokeseni makasi na bingumba mosusu ya mboka wana, mpo aza na mayele migi ya baarabe kasi ya bato ya Afrika te."" This translates to: ""The enclosure is very interesting with many foreign influences, but it is not based on Arab architecture but on African architecture.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bato bakoki kokota na engumba yango na mpepɔ:** The text doesn't mention whether people can swim in the enclosure.
* **B: Ezali exotiques koleka pauvre:** While the text describes Timbuktu as a significant and historically rich place, it doesn't explicitly label it as ""exotic"" or suggest it's poor.
* **D: Engumba yango ebendaka lisusu ba touristes te:** The text states that Timbuktu *used* to attract many visitors, and it *has* an airport, implying tourism is relevant now.

Therefore, option C best reflects the information provided in the text about the architectural influences on the enclosure.
"
Ntango nini masano ya jeux olympiques ya été esengelaki kosalema na ebandeli? ,"The correct answer is **A: sanza ya mwambi 2021**

The text states: ""Masano ya paralympiques ekosalema banda na mokolo ya 24 sanza ya mwambe kino na mokolo ya 5 sanza ya libwa 2021."" which translates to ""The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021.""
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, na ntango nini entonnoir ekómaka mopepe makasi?","The correct answer is **C: Ntango bazali kokita uta na mapata ya mopepe makasi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ebandaka neti ba entonnoirs oyo ezokita uta na mipepe eza na mapata, pe ekomaka """"mipepe makasi"""" ntango ekomaka na mabele."" This translates to: ""It forms funnels that extend upwards into the air, and it becomes """"very strong wind"""" when it hits the ground.""

Option C directly reflects this description.  The funnels and strong wind are a result of the tornado touching down and creating a vortex.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tango mipepe ekomi pene na 100 miles na ngonga:** The passage says tornadoes *reach* 100-200 mph, but it doesn't say that's *when* the funnel becomes very strong. It's the interaction with the ground that creates the strong wind.
*   **B: Ntango makonzí ya mopepe ebandi kobaluka:**  While the swirling of air is part of the tornado, the passage focuses on the funnel and its interaction with the ground.
*   **D: Nsima ya kosimba mabele:**  The tornado becoming strong is *when* it hits the ground and affects things like buildings (mentioned as ""it can tear apart large buildings""), not *because* it's hitting them.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi ezali ezaleli ya sikisiki ya mopepe makasi?","The correct answer is **A: Bazali ntango nyonso kobimisa mipepe pene na 100-200 miles na ngonga moko**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Ebimisaka mipepe ya makasi (mbala mingi 100-200 miles/ngonga)..."" which translates to ""They move very strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour)..."". Option A directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mbala mingi, batambolaka na biloko ya kilo** (Often, they carry things weighing tons): While tornados *can* lift heavy objects, the primary description in the text is about the wind speed. This option focuses on the weight of objects, not the wind speed.
* **C: Ekomaka ba entonnoir nsima ya kosimba mabele** (They form funnels to pick up things): The text mentions funnel-shaped clouds, but the core description isn't about their funnel formation specifically for picking up objects.
* **D: Ezali makonzí oyo ezali kobalusabalusa oyo etindika mopepe na libándá** (It's a vortex that is spinning and pushes air outwards): This is a good description of a tornado, but option A is a more direct answer to the question about where the strong winds are located.  Option A focuses on the speed of the winds, which is what the question specifically asks about.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, epai wapi moto oyo azali kosala mobembo asengeli kozwa toli mpo na makambo ya politiki na engumba oyo azali kokende?","The best answer is **B: Kowuta na makanisi oyo elakisami na kati ya toli ya mobembo.**

Here's why:

* **The text highlights the complexity of international relations and the need for nuanced understanding.** It states that ""Makanisi eza kaka kolobela na mokuse makambo oyo ezoleka na mboka moko,"" emphasizing that a single perspective isn't enough.  It also notes the differences in perspective between Americans, Europeans, and Arabs.

* **Option B directly addresses this need for a balanced perspective.** Consulting with a mediator who understands both the foreign policy and the nuances of the situation is the most logical step. A mediator can bridge the gap between different viewpoints and offer informed advice.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ewuti na gouvernement ya mboka ba’ko visiter:** Visiting the foreign government might be *part* of the solution, but it doesn't provide the crucial perspective needed to navigate political complexities. It's also potentially biased.
* **C: Ewuti na bana mboka ya mboka oyo bakozala kotala:** Consulting with local youth might offer insights into the on-the-ground realities, but they lack the political experience and broader understanding to advise on foreign policy.
* **D: Ewuti na gouvernement na bango moko:**  Relying solely on the foreign government is highly biased and unlikely to provide a balanced or objective perspective.



Therefore, **B** is the most reasonable and aligned with the text's message.



"
"Soki toli ya mobembo ezwi, nini mwana mboka ya mboka mopaya akoki kokutana na yango te?","The correct answer is **D: Bansango oyo epesami na sikisiki na ntina makambo ya politiki ya ekolo**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how cultural and political differences can create misunderstandings and mistrust, especially in business and international relations.  The core issue is that interpretations of ""mobembo"" (intention/purpose) can be drastically different depending on the cultural/political context. 

* **Option D** directly addresses this by pointing to the fact that people who are highly involved in political matters are the ones most likely to misinterpret intentions. This is because their understanding of ""mobembo"" is colored by their political perspectives, which might not align with the other party's.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Option A:**  ""Bolongoli ya assurance oyo epesaki makambo mabe"" (The assurance of reliability that gave bad things) is too general. The passage focuses on *how* misunderstandings arise, not just that bad things happen.
* **Option B:** ""Bokusi oyo ezalaki nan se mingi nan tina na makambo ya politiki ya ekolo"" (This misunderstanding is largely due to political matters) is also too broad. While politics plays a role, the passage emphasizes the cultural and interpretive gap.
* **Option C:** ""Assurance maladi oyo ebebisamaki"" (The assurance disease that is spreading) is metaphorical and doesn't directly relate to the passage's central argument.



Therefore, **D** is the best answer because it specifically connects the possibility of misinterpretation to those deeply involved in the political complexities surrounding the ""mobembo.""



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya mobembo ezali na likoki mingi te ya kosenga lisalisi ya kosala réservation epai ya agent ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **C: Mobembo oyo eko présenter barrière ya langue (The tour operator presents a language barrier)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that tour operators often target people who are interested in travelling to places they've seen on television, in magazines, or online. This implies a certain level of pre-existing interest and sometimes a lack of familiarity with the destination's language.  If the tour operator's staff doesn't speak the customer's language, it creates a significant obstacle to making a reservation.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Mobembo na likita ya mosala na engumba moko mobembo oyo akendaki kotala liboso (The tour operator is a simple agency that only offers tours to popular destinations):** While this *could* be a factor, the passage doesn't directly imply that popularity is the primary barrier. It's the language barrier that's more directly linked to the difficulty of booking.
* **B: Mobembo molai ya poso mibale na budget moko ya sikisiki mpenza (The tour operator is a very cheap agency with a very low budget):**  Cost is a factor, but the passage doesn't highlight affordability as a major reason for difficulty in booking.
* **D: Mobembo ya liboso ya mobembo na mboka mopaya (The tour operator is a simple tour operator from a faraway country):** The origin of the tour operator isn't necessarily the main challenge. Language is a more direct and common barrier.



Therefore, the language barrier is the most likely reason why someone might struggle to book a trip through a tour operator.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na likambo nini moto oyo azali kosala mobembo akozwa matomba mingi soki asalisi mosali ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **C: Ntango mobembo ayebi malamu monɔkɔ ya mboka ya esika oyo azali kokende congé** (When the traveler knows the exact location of the place they are going on vacation).

Here's why:

The text states that travel agencies often cater to people who want to see things they've seen in movies, on TV, or in books. This implies a desire to experience a specific place.  The question asks *why* a traveler might be very excited to travel. Option C directly addresses this: knowing the precise location and having a specific destination in mind fuels excitement.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ntango mobembo azali kosala réservation ya ba vols ya kokende mpe kozonga mpo na kotala mboka na bango** (When the traveler is booking flights to go and see the sights): Booking flights is a necessary step, but doesn't inherently cause *great* excitement. It's a logistical element.
* **B: Ntango mobembo azali na posa ya kosala réservation ya excursion spécialisée mpo nampo na mbala ya liboso** (When the traveler is in a position to book a specialized excursion for their annual vacation): Specialized excursions can be exciting, but the text focuses on the general desire to see specific locations.
* **D: Ntango mobembo azali kokende kotala esika oyo bokeseni ya mimeseno eyebani na bango** (When the traveler is going to see the place where their favorite movie was filmed):  While this *can* be exciting, it's a more specific and less universally applicable reason for travel excitement than knowing the exact location of a vacation destination.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kosalisa moto oyo azali kosala mobembo azanga mawa ntango azali kotala bisika ya sika?","The correct answer is **C: Kokangama na mibeko ndenge moko na esika bawuti**.

Here's why:

The original text emphasizes that people adapt to their environment. It says, ""Eza likambo oyo osengeli ntango nyonso kobosana te, po olemba nzoto te to mbala mosusu oyina te lolenge na bango ya kosala makambo.""  This translates to ""It's something you must always adapt to, so you don't become exhausted or repeatedly fail to find a way to do things.""

Option C, ""Kokangama na mibeko ndenge moko na esika bawuti"" (Adapting your routines to the specific environment where you are), directly addresses this idea.  If someone is having trouble sleeping in a new place, they need to adjust their routines (sleep schedule, pre-bed activities, etc.) to the new environment.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kozela mibeko ya ndenge moko lokola esika oyo bauti** (Repeating the same routines as in a bad place): This is the *opposite* of what the text advocates. It suggests *not* adapting.
*   **B: Kolinga komeka bilei oyo oyebi te** (Trying to ignore things you don't understand): Ignoring problems won't solve them; it will likely make them worse.
*   **D: Koboya bolukiluki ya liboso mpo na esika ya kolala** (Hiding the light entirely for the sleeping place): This is an extreme and impractical solution.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the text's message about adapting to your environment."
"Na kotalela makambo oyo ezali na mokapo yango, moto ya ndenge nini akoki kozala na mawa ntango azali kokende na esika mosusu?","The best answer is **A: Moto oyo alingaka bilei ya exotiques (Someone who likes exotic things)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that when we move to a new place, *everything* changes – from food to customs to sleep patterns. It highlights that things won't be as they are in our old environment.  Someone who enjoys exotic things is more likely to be open to and excited by these changes. They're comfortable with unfamiliarity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Moto oyo azali kokola malamu na mbongwana (Someone who is very cautious):**  The text suggests adapting to new things, which is the opposite of being cautious.
*   **C: Moto oyo azali na makanisi ya kokangama (Someone who has a tendency to socialize):** While socializing can help, the text focuses on adapting to the *environment* itself, not just interacting with people.
*   **D: Moto oyo asepelaka koyekola (Someone who likes to discover):** This is a plausible answer, but ""exotic things"" directly relates to the wide-ranging changes described in the text.  A person who likes to discover *might* be open to it, but a love for exotic things demonstrates a greater readiness for a complete environmental shift.



Therefore, **A** is the most logically derived answer from the text."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali toli oyo ebongi te mpo na bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo mpo na mbala ya liboso na mboka oyo ezali naino na bozwi mingi te?","The correct answer is **C: Ba recommandé mbeto ya mbeto to hamac soki ozali kosala camp libanda**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the danger of sleeping directly on the ground in areas with many animals.** It specifically mentions the risk of not knowing what animals have been on the sleeping surface.
* **Option C directly addresses this risk by recommending a tent or hammock when camping.** These options elevate you off the ground and reduce the chances of encountering animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeba banyama ya mboka liboso ya kolala na mabele** - This is factually incorrect. Wild animals do *not* regularly sleep on beds or mattresses.
* **B: Boya kolekisa mbongo mingi na bilei na boumeli ya mwa mikolo na yo ya liboso** - While a good mattress is nice, the passage focuses on the safety risk of ground sleeping, not just comfort.
* **D: Investir na hôtel ya qualité tango okoya mpo nampo na mbala ya liboso** - The passage specifically states that the described situations (camping, hammocks) are preferable to hotels for those who regularly engage in activities in animal-populated areas.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te lokola likambo ya kolekisa ndelo ntango ozali komesana na mboka oyo ezali naino na bozwi mingi te?","The correct answer is **C: Matela to pad mpo na kosala camp**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kolala te likolo ya matelas to ya coussin na mabele na bisika oyo oyebi te ndenge makambo ya mabele ezalaka.""  This translates to: ""Sleeping on a mattress or pillow on the ground in places where you don't know how things are is not ideal."" This directly points to the need for something to sleep on when camping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bilei ya ndenge ya mikili ya mpoto (Luxury amenities):** While mentioned as something to enhance the experience, luxury amenities don't directly address sleeping comfort in potentially risky environments.
* **B: Ba services ya kitoko makasi (Luxury services):** Similar to A, luxury services are not specifically about sleeping safety and comfort when encountering wild animals.
* **D: Ba hôtel ya kitoko makasi (Luxury hotels):** The passage contrasts luxury hotels with more adventurous options like camping, implying that luxury hotels aren't relevant to the scenario of being surrounded by wild animals.



"
"Na ba options oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala malamu mpo nampo na mobateli ya police oyo alingi kopi oyo ebetami ten a papye ya politiki na ye, kasi akoki kosalela internet te?","The correct answer is **C: Kobatela kopi moko kati na mémoire ya ordinateur moke na bango**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly states:** ""Soki ozosala mobembo na ordinatere ya maboko to tablete, bomba kopi moko na memoire na yango to na diske (esika okoki kosalela yango ata internet eza te).""  This means if the person doesn't have internet access, saving the file to a USB drive or external hard drive is the *correct* method.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kopesa kopi moko na moninga na ye ya mobembo:**  This is not ideal. While it provides a copy, it doesn't address the concern of not having internet access.
* **B: Komitindela bango moko kopi na nzela ya email:** This is incorrect because the person doesn't have internet access.
* **D: Kobomba kopi moko na “lipata”:** ""Lipata"" likely refers to cloud storage. This requires internet access, which the person lacks.



Therefore, option C directly aligns with the instructions provided in the prompt, catering to the situation where internet access is unavailable.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi esengeli te kolakisa na politiki?","The correct answer is **B: Addresse email ya motu ya assurance**.

Here's why:

The original text instructs people to provide the email address of the person who gave them assurance. This is a key element of the process described. The other options are less directly related to the core action of the process outlined in the text, which is to facilitate contact and communication.  The text emphasizes collecting contact information for follow-up and communication, and the assurance provider's email is crucial for that.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bonene nini ya mabe ezali komonisa lolenge ya filme oyo basalelaka mingi?","The correct answer is **A: 6 x 6 cm ya négatif**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""Ba apareyi ya foto misusu ya mike esalelaka format 6 cm na 6 cm, mingimingi na ndenge ya kozonga nsima 56 mm na 56 mm."" This directly identifies the 6x6 cm negative format.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: 56 x 56 mm ya négatif:** This is a different format entirely and not mentioned in the text as being used for ""misusu ya mike"" (many).
*   **C: 35 mm ya négatif:** The question explicitly states that 35mm is a common format.
*   **D: 36 x 24 mm ya négatif:** This is the standard 35mm film format.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the 6x6 cm negative format is the one being discussed as being used by some cameras."
"Na lolenge ya film oyo elandi, oyo wapi epesaka komonana oyo ekokani na DSLR?","The correct answer is **A: Film ya 35 mm**.

The text states: ""Mbala mingi bakoki kosangisa yango kozanga mpasi soki oza mokuse, mpe kosala ete ekokona na ndenge DSLR na yango ya sikoyo. **Ba apareyi ya foto misusu ya mike esalelaka format 6 cm na 6 cm, mingimingi na ndenge ya kozonga nsima 56 mm na 56 mm. Yango esalaka ete eloko wana eza monene mbala minei koleka 35 mm (3136 mm2 contre 864).**""

This means that the 35mm film is commonly used with DSLRs. Options B, C, and D describe larger film formats, and the question is specifically asking where the 35mm film is used with a DSLR.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na kati na yango, oyo wapi ekozala litambe ya nsuka mpo na kobanda mombongo ya kokoma mibembo?","The correct answer is **A: Meka kosala formatage ya web (Do a web formatting)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the most important step to create a website for sharing music.**  The initial statement in the prompt says that creating a website for sharing music involves formatting and using websites.
* **Web formatting** is fundamental to creating any website. It involves setting up the structure, layout, and visual appearance of the site. This is a prerequisite for anything else.
* **B (Making many posts for a single music blog)** is about content creation, not the initial website setup.
* **C (Host your own site)** is a possible outcome, but it depends on the formatting and content first.
* **D (Edit your own files)** is part of web development but a secondary step after establishing the basic structure.

Therefore, the most crucial first step is to establish the basic web formatting."
"Ntango obandi mombongo ya kokoma mibembo, makoki nini na oyo elandi esengeli mbala mosusu kobongisama liboso?","The correct answer is **B: Kobongisama ya internet**.

Here's why:

* **P (Question):** Mentions blogging and using websites. This implies the question is related to online activity and maintaining a presence online.
* **Q (Question):** Asks what needs frequent fixing if someone enjoys creating content.  Maintaining an online presence, especially through blogging, necessitates dealing with issues that arise from the internet.
* **B (Answer):** ""Kobongisama ya internet"" translates to ""Internet maintenance."" This is the most logical answer because a blog, being an internet-based platform, will inevitably require ongoing maintenance to fix problems, update content, and ensure it functions correctly.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kosala bablog** (Creating blogs): This is an activity, not something that *needs frequent fixing*.
* **C: Kobongola makambo** (Fixing things/Troubleshooting): While related, it's too broad. ""Internet maintenance"" is a more specific and encompassing answer.
* **D: Bokeli ya site internet** (Website design):  While website design is important initially, ongoing maintenance addresses issues that arise *after* the site is designed.



"
Na lolenge nini ya klima mikakatano ya misɔpɔ ezwamaka mingi?,"The answer is **C: Baklimat ya molunge (Temperate Climates)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na bisika mosusu na mokili, biloko ya zamba eza makambo ya sika mpona yo, eza polele ete okokutana na makambo. Lisusu, na bisika ya molunge mikrobe ekolaka noki pe eumelaka mingi na libanda ya nzoto.""

Translation: ""In many parts of the world, temperate climates are favorable for you, it is easier to encounter things. Furthermore, in temperate climates microbes can thrive and multiply in the soil.""

This clearly indicates that temperate climates are associated with a higher prevalence of diseases and microbes. The question asks where diseases like Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's itch, and Montezuma's revenge are common. These are often associated with travel to temperate or tropical regions.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Baklimat ya molunge**.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kozala mbala na mbala ekoki komema na immunité ya nini?","The correct answer is **C: Mikakatano ya mpema (Early immunity)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how encountering germs in new places can lead to illness, but also mentions that repeated exposure can lead to immunity. This immunity is built up over time with *early* exposure to microbes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mikakatano ya misopo (Vaccination):** While vaccination *does* build immunity, the passage focuses on immunity acquired through natural exposure to germs, not vaccines.
*   **B: Mikrobe ya mboka (Foreign microbes):**  Foreign microbes *cause* illness, they don't directly lead to immunity.  The passage explains how exposure to them *can* lead to immunity.
*   **D: Delhi Belly:** Delhi belly is a *specific type* of illness, not the general mechanism for building immunity. It's an example of the kind of illness that can arise, but not the source of immunity.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali litomba ya kosala mobembo na kati ya zone ya Schengen?","The correct answer is **C: Koboya bisika mingi ya kotala passeport**.

Here's why:

The passage states that when traveling within the Schengen area, you often *don't* need to show your passport again. Option C directly reflects this, stating you don't need to go to many places to present your passport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Koboya ba demandes ya visa ebele** (Having to file many visa applications): The passage actually says the Schengen area *reduces* the need for multiple visa applications.
*   **B: Kobomba mbongo** (Having to buy money): This is irrelevant to the passage's discussion about passport requirements within the Schengen zone.
*   **D: Esika passeport esengami te** (Places where passports are not valid): The passage implies passports *are* valid within the Schengen zone, just that you may not always need to present them.



"
Nini ekoki kozwama lisusu te na lilita ya Tutankhamun?,"The answer is **A: mwa biliko ya decoration** (the decoration on the walls).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bozwi ya mingi ya nkuda wana eza lisusu te na kati na yango, kasi balongola yango pe bamema yango na musée ya Egypte na Caire."" This translates to: ""Much of the knowledge about this tomb is still not inside it, but they have studied it and moved it to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.""

The sentence implies that the details and understanding of the tomb are *not all contained within the physical tomb itself*. The text then implies that the information about the tomb is found in the decoration (mwa biliko ya decoration) that was studied and then the tomb was moved to the museum. The other options (Mother's person, Mother's necklace, and Life) are not directly supported by the text's context.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, esika nini ya Vancouver ekosepelisa mingi te mpo na bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo oyo batalelaka ntalo ya biloko? ","The correct answer is **C: Esanga ya Bowen**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lisanga wana ya malamu ezalaka na Howe Sound pene ya Vancouver, pe okoki kokoma kuna kozanga mpasi na nzela ya bamasuwa oyo esalaka taxi oyo elongwaka esanga Granville na centre-ville ya Vancouver."" (The resort is in Howe Sound near Vancouver, and you can get there by taxi from Granville Street to downtown Vancouver.)

This directly links Bowen Island to the location for recreational activities suitable for those who don't want to travel too far. The other options are either not mentioned or are too far away for the description of ""bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo oyo batalelaka ntalo ya biloko"" (people who don't want to travel too far).
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, esika nini ekoki kopesa bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo likambo ya solosolo ya Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Esanga ya Bowen**.

The text explicitly states that Bowen Island is a great place for solo adventures in Vancouver, mentioning kayaking, hiking, shopping, and more. The question asks where to find such activities. Therefore, Bowen Island is the correct answer.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini bato oyo basalaka mibembo basengeli kokende kotala Chutes soki bazali koluka bisika oyo ezali kopekisa bango te?","The correct answer is **D: Na libanda ya eleko ya mbula (sanza ya zomi na moko kino na sanza ya misato)**.

The passage states: ""Na eleko ya mbula (sanza ya zomi na moko kino na sanza ya misato), mai ezalaka mingi mpe balobwaku ekozala makasi.""  This translates to: ""During peak season (the dry season and the rainy season), the water is much lower and the falls are very beautiful.""

The question asks when tourists should go to see the falls if they are experiencing low water levels. The passage implies that low water levels occur during the dry season. Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sanza ya zomi na moko tii na sanza ya misato** (Dry season and rainy season): While true, this is too general. The question asks *when* to go based on water levels.
*   **B: Na ntango ya eleko ya batouriste** (During the tourist season):  The passage doesn't connect the tourist season with water levels.
*   **C: Ntango mayi emati** (When the water is high): The passage describes low water levels as beautiful, implying the opposite of this option.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali malamu mpo na kotala Chutes Victoria kati na sanza ya zomi na moko mpe sanza ya misato?","The correct answer is **A: Bimoniseli ya chutes oyo ezipami te (The falls are not visible)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Na ndambo mosusu, eza mpenza po mai ezalaka likolo mingi yango wana okoki komona te malamu Balobwaku—mpona mai nyonso wana!"" which translates to ""On the other hand, it is often difficult for people to see the full majesty of the Falls—for all of that!"" This implies that viewing the falls from a short distance (sanza ya zomi na moko - a few meters) makes it difficult to appreciate their full scale. The same applies to a longer distance (sanza ya misato - several kilometers).

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Batouristes moke (Many tourists):** The text mentions many tourists, but this isn't the primary difficulty in seeing the falls.
* **C: BBimoniseli ya kokamwisa ya Chutes (The beauty of the Falls):** The text acknowledges the beauty, but highlights that it's *difficult to see* that beauty fully.
* **D: Koboya eleko ya mbula (To appreciate the scale):** This is essentially the same as the correct answer - it's difficult to appreciate the scale of the falls from either short or long distances.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the falls are not fully visible from either a short or long distance.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi esɛngami te ntango ozali kosalela drone mpo na kokanga ba film?","The correct answer is **D: Ko filmer kaka na ba endroits ebele esika drone ekozala remarquable te** (Filming only in places where the drone is not noticeable).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kopumbwisa drone pene ya aéroport to likolo ya bato ezalaka ntango nyonso likanisi mabe, ata soki bapekisaka yango te na mboka na bino."" (Flying a drone near an airport or crowded places is very bad, even if you register it).

This means you should avoid filming in places where a drone would be conspicuous and cause problems. The other options are less directly related to the warnings given in the text:

* **A: Kotala liboso nini ozali na ndingisa ya ko filmer** (Seeing everything you have in your filming angle) - While important for filming, it doesn't address the safety and legality issues raised.
* **B: Kozwa ndingisa mosusu** (Increasing the filming angle) -  This is irrelevant to the text's concerns about restricted zones.
* **C: Kosala bolukiluki na mikanda ya ndingisa** (Using a wide-angle lens) - Also not directly relevant to the safety and legality warnings.



Therefore, option D is the best answer because it aligns with the text's advice to avoid filming in prohibited or problematic areas."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bisika wapi ezali malamu koleka mpo na kokanga ba film na kosaleláká drone?","The correct answer is **B: Na bisika oyo bapesaka nzela te na kokanga ba foto mbala na mbala** (In places where they don't allow taking pictures often).

Here's why:

The text mentions that flying drones near airports or crowded places is problematic, *even if* you have permission. This implies the best locations for drone filming are places where photography/videography is generally restricted or not frequently allowed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pene na ebele ya bato oyo bakotungisama te na présence ya drone** (In places where many people are not familiar with the presence of drones): While this might be *a* factor, it doesn't pinpoint the *best* location. It doesn't necessarily mean it's a good or permitted place to film.
*   **C: Na bisika oyo bato balekaka mingi, mpe drone emonanaka mingi te** (In places where many people gather, and the drone is not seen often): This is a *bad* idea. Crowded places are explicitly mentioned as problematic.
*   **D: Na bisika oyo ozuaki ba permis ya liboso** (In places where you have a perpetual permit): This is incorrect. The text says even with a permit, flying near airports or crowded places is problematic. Perpetual permits don't negate those restrictions.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bisika wapi ezali malamu koleka mpo na kokanga ba film na kosaleláká drone?","The correct answer is **C: Ekoki kosenga kokende kotala babiro oyo etalelaka makambo ya bato oyo bautá na mikili mosusu** (You can try going to agencies that specialize in helping people who are traveling illegally).

Here's why:

* **The first paragraph of the provided text discusses the illegal smuggling of people.** It states that people who smuggle people are often involved in other illegal activities and are motivated by financial gain.  This implies that places where illegal activities happen are also likely to be places where drone filming might be problematic.
* **The question asks about locations where filming with a drone might be problematic.**  The context points towards areas related to illegal immigration and potentially illegal activity.
* **Option C aligns with the context:**  Agencies that help people traveling illegally would likely be aware of locations where such travel occurs and where drone filming might draw unwanted attention or be considered intrusive.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Soki ozali kofanda na bisika ya kolala ya batouristes, ekoki kozala ete osengeli te kokomisa nkombo** (If you are staying in tourist accommodations, you may not be allowed to use a drone).  This is about restrictions in tourist areas, not necessarily areas where filming would be *problematic* in a legal or ethical sense.
* **B: Bikólo nyonso esɛngaka kokomisa nkombo na bakonzi ya mboka** (It is always okay to use a drone with border officials). This is completely incorrect and potentially dangerous.  Using a drone near border officials is likely illegal and would attract significant scrutiny.
* **D: Na bisika mosusu, ba hotels ya mboka ekoki kosala mosala ya kokomisa nkombo** (In many places, border hotels can use a drone for surveillance). While hotels *might* use drones, this is related to security and surveillance, not necessarily where filming with a private drone would be problematic.



"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali esika oyo touriste akoki kokende te mpo na kosala mosala ya kokomisa nkombo na bango?","The correct answer is **D: Babiro ya immigration**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ekoki kosenga kotondisa mokanda na polisi ya mboka to kokende na biro ya immigration."" (It's possible to report a loss to the police or go to the immigration office.)
* **Immigration offices** are the official authorities responsible for matters related to visas, entry, and legal status in a country. They are the appropriate place to report a lost passport and begin the process of obtaining a replacement.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Biro ya bapolisi moko ya mboka (Police station):** While reporting a lost passport to the police is an option, the immigration office is the primary authority for passport replacement.
* **B: Hotel oyo ba’zovanda (The hotel they are staying at):** The text mentions hotels *may* offer assistance, but it's not a reliable or official place to *conduct* the passport replacement process. The hotel might provide information or temporary solutions, but it cannot officially replace the passport.
* **C: Poste moko ya mboka (Post office):** Post offices are not typically involved in passport replacement procedures.
"
Nani akozwa matomba te soki azali kosala mosala ya bolingo malamu ntango azali kosala mobembo?,"The correct answer is **C: Moto oyo azali na elikya ya kozwa mayele ya sika (A person who has a desire to harm others).**

Here's why:

The text says that practicing selfless love (mosala ya bolingo malamu) is about understanding others, connecting with different people, learning, and appreciating the beauty of life.  It also mentions that this can lead to immense joy and strong bonds.

The question asks who *shouldn't* practice selfless love when giving a gift. The text implies that someone who has a desire to harm others (kozwa mayele ya sika) is not suitable for genuine selfless giving.  Their motivation wouldn't be pure and loving.  The other options don't directly relate to the text's critique of insincere selfless acts.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini kosala mosala ya bolingo malamu ntango ozali na mboka mopaya ezali na litomba mpo na moto oyo azali kosala mobembo oyo azali na mbongo mingi?","The best answer is **B: Mbala mingi ememaka na mabaku ya mosala (Often happens during sexual activity).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly connects intimacy and sexual activity with strengthening a loving relationship.**  It mentions the intimacy of sharing, understanding, and having emotional and physical closeness.  This directly links physical intimacy with the deepening of the relationship.
* **The question asks about the impact on someone with a strong desire for love.** The passage implies that fulfilling that desire through intimate connection is a key element of a strong and fulfilling loving relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Pene na ntango nyonso, bapesaka lifuti (Always involves intercourse):** The passage *doesn't* say that intimacy *always* involves intercourse. It's a broader concept of closeness.
* **C: Bapesaka ntango mosusu chambre mpe bilei (Often happens in the bedroom and more):**  While the bedroom is associated with intimacy, the ""more"" is vague. The focus of the passage is not just the location, but the *act* of closeness and sharing.
* **D: Ekoki kosalisa yo ozwa liyoki ya kotalela makambo (You can satisfy yourself if you have a desire to do things):**  This is a completely irrelevant and slightly inappropriate suggestion.  The question is about intimacy within a loving relationship, not self-satisfaction.



Therefore, option B best reflects the passage's emphasis on how physical intimacy (often during sexual activity) contributes to a deeper and more fulfilling loving relationship.

"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, nini ekoki kotalelama lokola atypique ya mobembo ya moyenne na Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **B: Kofanda na hôtel moko oyo ezali libanda ya esika yango**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a ""gentle visit"" that involves staying at a Disney hotel. While it's not uncommon to stay at a Disney hotel, the passage implies that this particular *combination* – flying into Orlando, taking a bus to a Disney hotel, and then spending the entire time within the Disney bubble – is considered atypical. The passage states it's what people often refer to as ""going to the Disney world"" and that lots of people do it. But the mention of the restriction on reselling tickets indicates this type of package is being increasingly controlled by Disney.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kolekisa poso moko na kotalatala ba parcs** - Collecting tickets to visit the parks is not specifically mentioned as being atypical.
*   **C: Kolekisa mobembo mobimba na biloko ya Disney** - While the visit is centered around Disney, the passage focuses on the *manner* of visiting, not the extent of Disney-related activities.
*   **D: Kozwa bisi longwa na libándá ya mpepo tii na hotel** - Taking long bus rides is a standard part of transportation and isn't presented as unusual.

Na ba affirmations oyo elandi ya Walt Disney World oyo wapi ezali ya solo te?,"The correct answer is **C: Ezali na bisi oyo ekoki komema bato oyo bazali kosala mobembo wuta aeroport kino na esika yango.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Visiti """"ya malamu"""" esengaka kozwa mpempona Aeroport international ya Orlando, **kokende na hotel Disney na bisi**...""  This directly confirms that there's a bus service connecting the airport to the Disney hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Batike ya park-hopper ekoki kopesama na ba voyageur misusu:** While the passage mentions park hopper tickets, it doesn't say they *can* be sold to other travelers. It focuses on the difficulty and illegality of reselling them.
* **B: Ezali na bisika ya kolala na esika yango:** This is vague. The passage mentions hotels, but doesn't describe the location of those hotels in relation to the parks.
* **D: Mbala mingi, bakoki kozwa tike ya mikolo mingi na basite Internet ya ba ventes aux enchères:** The passage states that people *try* to sell tickets on sites like eBay and Craigslist, but that it's often illegal and Disney doesn't allow it.  It doesn't say they *can* easily purchase tickets there.



"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kolobelama mingi te na kelasi ya formation professionnelle to na mikanda?","The correct answer is **C: Kozala prêt ya zone ya bitumba (Be ready for the landing zone)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a scenario where aircraft are landing.** The key phrases like ""moto nyonso azokana kokende na mboka oyo azokana kokende na mboka oyo bato balobaka eza esika ya bitumba"" (everyone is waiting to go to the area where people say the landing is) and the mention of ""formation ya malamu"" (tight formation) and ""zona ya bitumba"" (landing zone) clearly indicate a flight landing operation.
* **The question asks where the information to improve understanding of this scenario can be found.**  Being ""ready for the landing zone"" (knowing what to expect and being prepared) is the most directly relevant to understanding and participating in such an operation. It's about having the necessary knowledge and being prepared for the specifics of the landing process.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kobika na esobe (Be attentive/Be careful):** While attentiveness is important, it doesn't directly address *where* to find more information.
* **B: Komibongisa mpo na lisalisi ya liboso (Prepare for a long flight):** This is irrelevant to a landing scenario.
* **D: Ko jouer role (Play a role):** This refers to acting or taking on a part, not finding information about a landing operation.



Therefore, preparing for the landing zone (knowing what to expect and being ready) is the most pertinent information to look for.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na mateya oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozwama mingi na kelasi ya formation professionnelle?","The correct answer is **B: Bisika ya bitumba (Manufacturing area)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Moto nyonso azokana kokende na mboka oyo azokana kokende na mboka oyo bato balobaka eza esika ya bitumba asengeli kozwa formation ya malamu.""  This translates to: ""Everyone who wants to go to the company they are looking for must go to the manufacturing area to undergo proper training.""

Therefore, the manufacturing area is where the training/formation takes place.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali nzela ya malamu koleka mpo na kokima mai oyo ekoki kozala na mikrobe?","The correct answer is **B: Somba mayi ya milangi (Boil the water)**.

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** The water needs to be treated to be safe, especially for drinking. The text also mentions that filters aren't always effective and chemical treatment is needed if you have a purifier.
* **Boiling water is a reliable purification method:** Boiling water for at least 1 minute kills most harmful bacteria and viruses.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Lamba mayi pendant ba minutes ebele (Boil water for many minutes):**  While longer boiling is even safer, 1 minute is generally sufficient to kill most pathogens.
    * **C: Lamba mayi pendant minute moko (Boil water for one minute):** This is a *minimum* recommended time for boiling to be effective.
    * **D: Tala mayi mpo na makama ya sikisiki (Look at the water for clarity):** Clarity doesn't guarantee safety.  Water can be clear but still contain harmful microorganisms.

Therefore, boiling the water is the most effective method among the options provided for making it safe from microbes, especially considering the text's emphasis on the need for purification."
Kobeta mai penepene na ba récifs?,"The text describes the problem of coral bleaching. Coral bleaching happens when the water temperature rises, causing corals to expel the algae (zooxanthellae) living in their tissues. These algae are what give corals their color and provide them with food. Without the algae, the coral turns white (bleaches) and can eventually die. The text also mentions that rising ocean acidity can contribute to coral bleaching.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Kobeta mayi penepene na ba récifs (Removing water superficially from reefs)** - This isn't the core issue described in the text. While water flow is important, the problem is the *temperature and acidity* of the water, not just removing it.
*   **B: Kobeta mayi kati na mayi ya mozindo (Removing water within the seawater)** -  This is too general. The text focuses on how changes in ocean conditions directly impact the corals.
*   **C: Kobeta mayi na sens mosusu (Removing water in a broader sense)** - This is also too broad and doesn't capture the specific mechanism of coral bleaching.
*   **D: Kobeta mayi na mayi zingazinga ya mbonge (Removing water in a large amount of sewage)** - The text doesn't directly mention sewage, but rising ocean acidity *can* be influenced by increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (partly from human activities and industrial processes), which contributes to a change in ocean chemistry. This option is the *closest* to describing a potential factor causing the problem, although it doesn't perfectly fit the described mechanism.

However, considering that the primary cause described is rising temperatures leading to the expulsion of algae, the question is ill-posed given the options. If I *have* to choose the best option reflecting a *potential* contributing factor based on the provided options, **D** is the *least wrong* answer, although it doesn't precisely state the cause.



**Therefore, based on the limited options, the answer is D: Kobeta mayi na mayi zingazinga ya mbonge.**
"
Osengeli kosala nini soki okangami na mbonge?,"The correct answer is **B: Beta mayi mbangu koleka na sens mususu** (Water more often with more understanding).

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes that the problem is excessive water usage. It states that people are overwatering plants because they believe it will help them grow, but it's actually detrimental. The text suggests that if the soil is already wet, don't water again. It also encourages understanding the plant's needs.

Option B, ""Beta mayi mbangu koleka na sens mususu,"" directly aligns with this message of understanding the plant's needs and watering more thoughtfully.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Meka kobima na mbonge na koluka na ngambo mosusu, nsima beta mayi lisusu na libongo** (Don't be afraid of the plant and understand the soil more, before watering again with water). While understanding the soil is important, the emphasis is on *less* watering, not necessarily more informed watering.
*   **C: Beta mayi na ngambo mosusu** (Water more on the plant). This is the opposite of what the text advises.
*   **D: Beta mayo na nse ya mayi** (Water the soil).  While watering the soil is necessary, the text warns against *over*watering.
