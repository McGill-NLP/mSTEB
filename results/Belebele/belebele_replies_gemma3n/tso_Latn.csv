"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi nga ta tekiwa ku nga ri xitsundzuxo lexi kongomeke leswaku u tlanga kositina hi ndlela leyi humelelaka?","The correct answer is **A: Ku engetela mpfumawulo, engetela matimba lama u yimbelelaka hawona**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *should be avoided* to prevent a harsh sound when playing the piano. The passage explicitly states that **avoiding excessive force and letting the sound resonate freely are key to achieving a pleasant tone.**

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U nga famba fambi ku nga laveki leswaku u hlayisa matimba ya wena (You should not move around without paying attention to relaxing your muscles):** While relaxation is important for overall playing, this option doesn't directly address the *sound* quality.
* **C: Xiya leswaku u ba tinotsi hala voko ra wena ri tshama ri ntshunxekile (Make sure the keys are not sticking and sound harsh):** This focuses on *technical issues* with the piano itself, not how the player should approach playing.
* **D: Engetela rivilo leri fambisaka xihuhuti ku kuma mpfumawulo wa le henhla ngopfu (Add a pedal that allows the sound to resonate more):**  Pedaling *can* be used to enhance the sound, but it's not the problem when a harsh sound is produced. In fact, overuse of the pedal can *contribute* to a muddy or uncontrolled sound.



Therefore, option A directly addresses the core principle of avoiding harsh sounds by controlling force and allowing the sound to resonate naturally.

"Loko u tlanga kositina, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga ta ku pfuna ku engetela mpfumawulo?","The correct answer is **C: Ntshikelelo wutsongo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka kositina, leswaku u kuma mpfumawulo wo engeteleka, u tirhisa xihuhuti hi ku engetela **ntshikelelo ni rivilo**.""  This translates to: ""In the orchestra, when you hear an out-of-tune sound, you use the bow by adding **precision and vibrato**.""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions *precision* (ntshikelelo) as a crucial element to correct an out-of-tune sound.
"
Ha yini swifaniso swa le thelevhixini swi tsemiwile ematlhelo hinkwawo?,"The correct answer is **B: Leswaku xifaniso xi tala eka xikirini hinkwaswo** (Because the picture is distorted on the screen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Leswi swi endleriwa ku tiyisisa leswaku xifaniso xi tata xikirini hinkwaxo."" (These actions are done to ensure the picture on the screen is not distorted.) The other options don't directly relate to the reason for the distortion.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiphiqo swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi un’wana a nga langutanaka na swona loko a hundzula muvhi yi va fomati ya DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Marito lama hlamuselaka vhidiyo lama nga tsemiwa xiphemu.**

Here's why:

The question describes the issue of ""anamisa leswi voniwaka eka xikirini"" (image bleeding/artifacts on the screen) when burning DVDs. The text explains that this happens when the DVD burning process doesn't properly account for the edges and corners of the disc. This results in colors ""bleeding"" or artifacts appearing around the edges of the image on the screen.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Xifaniso leswi nga tatiki xikirini hinkwaswo (The image doesn't match the screen):** While there might be *some* mismatch, the core issue described is the *bleeding* of colors and artifacts *around* the image, not a general image mismatch.
* **C: Xifaniso lexi tataka xikirini hinkwaswo (The image matches the screen):** This is the opposite of the problem.
* **D: Matlhelo lama nga tsemiwa (Corners that don't match):** While corners *can* be a contributing factor, the problem goes beyond just corners. It's about the bleeding of color *around* the entire image, not just the corners. The text specifically mentions artifacts appearing at the top, bottom, left, and right edges.

Therefore, option B, ""Marito lama hlamuselaka vhidiyo lama nga tsemiwa xiphemu"" (Colors that bleed from the video and don't stop at the edges), best describes the artifacting issue explained in the text. The phrase ""xiphemu"" (edge) further emphasizes this point.
"
A yi ri kwihi ndhawu leyi laha masocha ya le Britain a ma rindza kona?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The passage states: ""Murhangeri nkulu John Cadwalder a a kota ku sungula nhlaselo wa vukanganyisi eka British gamison eBordentown..."" which translates to ""Major John Cadwalder was able to begin a campaign of harassment against British operations at Bordentown...""
"
A ku ri nsayino wa mani lowu a wu ri eka mpfampfarhuto lowu tsariweke hi voko?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The text states: ""mpfampfarhuto lowu tsariweke hi voko lowu sayiniweke hi Murhangeri wa Khongresi John Hancock swin’we ni **Matsalana Charles Thompson** wu yisiwe eka vhengele ro kandziyisa ra le kusuhi ra John Dunlap.""

This directly indicates that Charles Thomson signed the broadside. John Dunlap printed it, but the question asks who signed the broadside.
"
"Eka tindhawu leti landzelaka, hi le kwihi laha Dunlap broadside yi nga fika ro hetelela?","The correct answer is **C: E Landhani**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kopi yi fike eLandhani hi August 10."" (Copies arrived in Philadelphia on August 10th.)
"
Masocha ya Mukolonele Stark a ma ri kwihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Emakumu ya le n’walungwini, etlhelo ka fenisi**.

The passage states: ""Stark va teke tlhelo ra fenisi en’walungu ka mahetelelo ya ndhawu ya vakholonisi. Loko ku tlakuka ka mati ya lwandle ku ye ehansi ku siye vangwa eMystic River en’walungu-vuxa bya peninsula, hi xihatla va engetele fenisi hi khumbi ro koma ra ribye en’walungwini ri helela emakumu ka mati eribuweni leritsongo."" This translates to: ""Stark followed the front of the English fleet. When the tide went down and brought them to Mystic River on the English-vuxa peninsula, they then boarded the fleet on a borrowed boat and sailed to the shallows of the river in the forest.""

Therefore, Stark's troops ended up in the shallows of the river in the forest, which is described as ""emakumu ya le n’walungwini"" (in the shallows of the river). They were at the front of the English fleet (""etlhelo ka fenisi"").
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, a ku ri rini loko vavanuna va Stark va engetela fenisi ya vona?","The correct answer is **C: Loko ku tlakuka ka mati ya le lwandle ku ye ehansi**.

The passage states: ""Loko ku tlakuka ka mati ya lwandle ku ye ehansi ku siye vangwa eMystic River..."" which directly indicates that the soldiers boarded the ships when the tide went out.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i nkarhi wihi eka leyi landzelaka laha a ku ri nguva wa madzolonga ngopfu le Chayina?","The correct answer is **D: Nguva wa Mimfumo Minharhu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nkarhi lowunene eka leyi lowu tivekaka a kuri nguva ya Mifumo Minharhu lowu nga endleka nkarhi wa malembe ya 60 exikarhi ka Mfumo wa Han ni Jin."" (The real time for this to happen was during the Era of the Sixteen Kingdoms, which occurred during the 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.)

The question asks about the period *after* the Era of the Sixteen Kingdoms when there were many warlords in China. The passage then directly links the era of the Sixteen Kingdoms to the rise of many warlords.  Therefore, the period following the Sixteen Kingdoms, which saw many warlords, is the **Mfumo wa Jin (Jin Dynasty)**.

While the passage mentions the Sixteen Kingdoms, the prompt is asking about the era *after* that period of many warlords. 
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi nga ntiyiso hi kholoni ya vusokobyi loko byi nghena eka xiyenge xa nomadikhi?","The correct answer is **B: Swa kudya a swi kumeki ngopfu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kholoni yi sungula xiyenge xa nomadikhi loko swa kudya swi nga kumeki ngopfu.""  This translates to ""The colony started a winter encampment when food was scarce.""  The passage then goes on to describe what happened *during* the winter encampment.  Therefore, the reason for establishing the encampment was the lack of food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Byi dzima matente nivusiku (They pitched tents at night):** While they did pitch tents, this isn't the *reason* they started the encampment.
* **C: Byi endla tindhawu to tshama leti cinciwaka endzhaku ka masiku ya 17 (They made places to travel that change after 17 days):**  This describes the *activities* during the encampment, not the *reason* for it.  The 17 days refer to the length of the encampment.
* **D: Byi macha ninhlikanhi (They were new and inexperienced):**  The passage doesn't mention their newness or inexperience as a reason for the encampment.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi leswi hlamuselaka kahle mikhuva ya ku endla ndhawu yo tshama ya kholoni ya vusokobyi hi nkarhi wa xiyenge xa nomadikhi?","The correct answer is **C: Byi cinca tindhawu to tshama siku ni siku.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eka xiyenge xa nomadikhi, koloni yi endla tindhawu ta ku tshama bya swi nkadyana leti **cinciwaka masiku hinkwawo**.""  This directly translates to ""In a rainy season, the colony made temporary shelters which **were changed daily**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Byi endla tindhawu to tshama nivusiku** (They made shelters at night) - The passage doesn't mention building shelters at night. It focuses on daily changes.
* **B: Byi macha masiku ya 17 handle ka ku endla tindhawu to tshama** (They were built on the 17th of the month to make shelters) - The passage mentions shelters being built *during* the rainy season, not specifically on the 17th.
* **D: Byi tirhisa tindhawu leti fanaka ta ku tshama hi nkarhi wa xiyenge** (They used existing shelters during the rainy season) - The passage says they *made* new shelters, not used existing ones.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta ya emahlweni hambi ku ri ni swivangelo swa ntumbuluko?,"The correct answer is **D: Mafambiselo ya ntumbuluko lama phindha-phindhaka (Recurring infections)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mafambiselo ya ntumbuluko, lama nga ri ki ndlela ya ku hlamula leswi fanele swi endla ntsena, ma tsariwe hansi la ma swilo swo tala leswi hanyaka ku katsa tibakhitheriya, fungi, swimila na swihari. Leswi lawuraka ku endleka ka swilo swa ntumbuluko hi nkarhi wa swona swa ti endlekela naswona swi ta ku ya mahlweni hi ku ti endlekelela hambiloko ku nga swilo leswi yi rhumaka ku endla tano.""

This translates to: ""Infections, which are not a way to resolve what should happen, are often caused by various elements such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites. What happens with infections at their time often progresses to the point of recurring infections, from initially mild to potentially serious.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions that infections can progress to recurring infections.



"
I rito rihi leri hlamuselaka vanhu lava kombisaka ku hambana ka xitekela xo karhi?,"The correct answer is **D: Polimofiki**.

The question asks for the term used to describe people who show variation in a particular trait. The passage states that ""Loko vanhu va kombisa ku hambana ko hlayanyana eka xilo xo karhi, va yi polimofiki,"" which translates to ""When people show variation in a particular trait, they are called polymorphic.""

Therefore, **polimofiki** is the term that describes people who show variation in a particular trait.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i rihi rito leri faneleke ra swivumbiwa leswi tshamaka endhawini yo karhi?,"The correct answer is **B: Nhlengeletano ya swivumbiwa**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the name of the *collective* term for the types of interactions described.** The passage states that the interactions are ""nhlayo ya ku tshama yi nhlengeletano ya swivumbiwa"" - a ""gathering of understood interactions.""
* **Monomofiki** refers to a specific type of interaction (people with a shared characteristic).
* **Polimofiki** refers to another specific type of interaction (people with diverse reactions).
* **Tinxaka ta swivumbiwa** (causes of interactions) is too broad and doesn't specifically address the *types* of interactions being discussed.

Therefore, **Nhlengeletano ya swivumbiwa** (gathering of understood interactions) is the most accurate and encompassing answer for the overall category of interactions.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga riki xikombiso xa leswi nga endliwa tanihi vupfhumba lebyi seketeriweke eka ntumbuluko?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku khandziya tintshava ku ya eka boboma ra mati (Traveling to the bottom of the ocean)**.

Here's why:

The question describes a specialized submersible used for deep-sea exploration. The text mentions activities like:

*   ""ku vhakela, ku teka swinepe, ni ku dyonda hi..."" (diving, collecting samples, and studying...)
*   ""...eBorneo."" (in Borneo) - This seems like a misplaced detail and likely a distraction. The core description focuses on deep-sea operations.

Looking at the options, only traveling to the bottom of the ocean aligns with the submersible's purpose of exploring the depths and collecting samples from the seabed. The other options are not directly related to deep-sea submersible activities.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga xisekelo xa fambiselo ra swilo leswi fambisaka vanhu?","The correct answer is **D: Ku ti endlekela ka vanhu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Eka swiyimo swa swilo leswi fambisaka vanhu leswi tshamaka swi cinca, vanhu hinkwavo va seketela swilo swa ku fambisa swa mimovha ya vanhu."" (In the impact of the goods that are moved quickly, people are increasingly affected, people are increasingly affected by the goods of people's cars.)
* **It further explains:** ""Sweswi sayense yi kombisa leswaku khaboni ikhonomi leyi nkulu yi suse swiyimo swa misava eka ndhawu ya yona leyi tiyeke leyi seketelaka ku ti endlekela ka vanhu eka timiliyoni ta malembe lama hundzuke."" (Scientific studies show that the large carbon economy has caused global damage to the place it has left behind, which has increasingly affected people over millions of years.)

Therefore, the passage directly connects the movement of goods (and especially cars) to the impact on people. Option D accurately reflects this connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tindhawu ta ntirho (Workplaces):** While workplaces are affected by the economy, the passage focuses more broadly on the impact on *people* themselves.
* **B: Timovha ta vanhu (People's cars):** Cars are just one example of the goods being moved. The passage discusses the general impact of the movement of goods.
* **C: Ndhawu leyi ku tshamaka swivumbiwa leyi tiyeke (The abandoned place where goods are moved):**  The passage discusses the *impact on people* due to the movement of goods, not the state of the abandoned locations.



"
Swilo leswi rhendzeleke nyutliliya ti ni muxaka wihi wa chaji?,"The correct answer is **D: Chaji ya phositivhi ni negetivhi**.

Here's why:

* **Protons** have a **positive** electrical charge.
* **Neutrons** have **no charge** (they are neutral).
* **Electrons** have a **negative** electrical charge.

Therefore, the nucleus (containing protons and neutrons) has a positive charge, and the electrons orbiting the nucleus have a negative charge."
Nyutliliya yi endliwe hi swilo swihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Tiphorotoni, tinyuturoni, ni tielekitironi**.

The passage states: ""Nyutliliya I na swilo swimbirhi - tinyuturoni na tiporotoni. Ti phurothoni ti na phositivhi elekitiriki chaji kasi ti nyutironi a ti na chaji. Ti elekitironi ti na negetivhi elektiriki chaji.""  This means that protons, neutrons, and electrons are the components of an atom.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, eka leswi landzelaka i yini xikombiso xa tinomboro leti tirhisiwaka?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

The question describes binary numbers, which are numbers represented using only two digits: 0 and 1. The example given (1010) is a valid binary number. The question asks for *a* possible binary number.  The options provided are all valid binary numbers. However, the problem implicitly references the statement in the problem describing the usage of binary numbers in modern computers. Therefore, choosing C is logical.
"
Tinomboro leti tirhisiwaka nakambe ti vitaniwa yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Tibiti**.

The question defines binary numbers as numbers represented by 0s and 1s, and these 0s and 1s are called **bits** (tibiti in Otomba).
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga vuriwangiki eka ndzimana tanihi ku vuyeriwa ka ku tsala tibulogo ta machudeni?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku hlalmusela ndhawu ya vona**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ku buloga swi kucetela moya wo tirhisana, no khuthaza machudeni dyondza ni loko va nga ri exikolweni. Ku tirhisiwa lokunene ka tibulogo """"ku nga pfuna machudeni leswaku ma va ni matimba yo anakanya; hi ku hlamula swilo swale ka inthanete, machudeni va nga hlamusela ndhawu ya vona loko ku langutiwe matsalelo ya van’ona ni langutelo ra vona eka timhaka to karhi (Oravec, 2002).""

This translates to: ""Bullying creates a climate of hostility, and encourages students to learn. The proper use of bullying creates a climate where students are empowered; by analyzing things on the internet, students can understand their place when the problems of others and their own analysis are studied in the public sphere (Oravec, 2002).""

Therefore, the text directly connects bullying to students understanding their place and analyzing things, which means learning about themselves and their position.
"
I yini eka swiyenge leswi landzelaka swa ku tsala tibulogo leswi nga tekiwa tanihi ku khuthaza machudeni ku antswisa vuswikoti byo tsala?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hlamula swilo swa le ka inthanete nkarhi ni nkarhi.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ku tirhisiwa lokunene ka tibulogo """"ku nga pfuna machudeni leswaku ma va ni matimba yo anakanya; hi ku hlamula swilo swale ka inthanete, machudeni va nga hlamusela ndhawu ya vona loko ku langutiwe matsalelo ya van’ona ni langutelo ra vona eka timhaka to karhi (Oravec, 2002).""

This translates to: ""The proper use of blogs aims to empower students; by examining things on the internet, students can defend their position when analyzing the problems of others and their own analysis in various fields (Oravec, 2002).""

Option A directly reflects this empowerment through online examination. The other options are either not mentioned or are secondary outcomes, not the primary way blogs encourage critical thinking.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga riki vuyelo bya ku vulavurisana loku nga humeleriki hi nkarhi wun’we eka machudeni? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ku vulavula ni vadyondzisi hi nkarhi un’wana ni un’wana.**

Here's why:

The passage states that online communication and the World Wide Web allow students to communicate with instructors at any time. This directly addresses the issue of asynchronous communication (communication that doesn't happen in real-time), which is a key factor in overcoming the problem of inflexible communication schedules.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ku tirhisiwa ka inthanete tanihi xitirhisiwa** (The use of the internet as a tool): While the internet *is* a tool, this option doesn't explain *how* it solves the problem.
*   **C: Matirhelo lama olovaka** (Missed deadlines): The passage says online communication *prevents* missed deadlines. It doesn't explain why missed deadlines are a problem in asynchronous communication.
*   **D: Vulawuri bya rivilo** (Communication rules): The passage mentions communication rules but doesn't link them to the solution for asynchronous communication.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka swiyenge leswi landzelaka swa ku vulavurisana loku nga humeleriki hi nkarhi un’we leyi nga riki yo olova eka machudeni?","The correct answer is **C: Voxokoxoko bya madyondziselo (Feedback systems)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku pfumelela machudeni leswaku ma tirha hi rivilo ra wona vini va tlhela va lawula rivilo ra vuxokoxoko bya madyondziselo.""  This translates to: ""Success in online learning is often achieved through feedback systems.""  The question asks what is the *reason* that prevents online learning from being timely. The passage directly links the lack of timely feedback to problems with feedback systems.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Rivilo ra ku dyondza (Learning curves):** While learning curves exist, the passage doesn't connect them to the issue of *timely* feedback.
* **B: Tiawara ta ku tirha (Time constraints):**  Time constraints are a general problem, but the passage specifically points to feedback systems as the culprit for issues with timing.
* **D: Ku tirhisiwa ka inthanete (Use of the internet):**  The internet facilitates feedback (as mentioned in the passage), so it's not the *reason* for the lack of timely feedback; in fact, it *enables* timely feedback.



"
I yini leswi nga vuriwangiki eka ndzimana tanihi leswi munhu a nga swi katsakanya ni xigodlo xa ndhavuko xa le ka malembexikarhi?,"The correct answer is **C: Vunjhinga (Archaeology)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes archaeological findings:** The passage explicitly mentions ""mikondzo ya tihanci eswiribyanini"" (artifacts in the soil) and ""nun’hwelo wa nchavo wu huma emigodini ya vubohiwa"" (traces of a settlement coming from excavated settlements). This points directly to archaeological investigations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emigodini ya vabohiwa (Excavated settlements):** While excavated settlements are relevant to archaeology, they are a *result* of the archaeological work, not the field itself.
* **B: Lava lwaka va khandziye tihanci (The old people gathered artifacts):** This is a possible source of artifacts, but it doesn't describe the systematic study and interpretation of those artifacts, which is key to archaeology.  It's more likely a cultural practice than a scientific discipline.
* **D: Tinhenha (Mythology):** Mythology deals with stories and beliefs, not with the scientific study of the past through physical evidence. While myths *can* be related to archaeological discoveries, they aren't the same thing.



Therefore, **Vunjhinga (Archaeology)** is the most accurate answer because the passage details the methods and discoveries of archaeological investigations."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga si vuriwa eka ndzimana tanihi minun’hwelo kumbe mimpfumawulo leyi twiwaka emarhumbini ya xigodlo?,"The best answer is **D: Ku ketlaketla ka mikondzo ya tihanci eswiribyanini**.

Here's why:

* The question states that ""ku twa onge ku twala ku ketlaketla ka mikondzo ya tihanci eswiribyanini ni ku twa nun’hwelo wa nchavo wu huma emigodini ya vubohiwa"" (it was seen that the ground was filled with bones and a scent of war rose from the ruined cities). 
* Option D directly reflects this key detail.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ku lwa (War):** While war *caused* the events, it isn't the specific *thing* seen in the ruins.
* **B: Nchavo (Scent/Smell):**  While there's a scent of war, option D is more precise about what that scent is *associated with* (bones).
* **C: Swakudya swa vanhu vo tala (Ancient food):** The text mentions ancient food being stored, but it's not the primary detail described in the ruins themselves.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
I yihi eka leti landzelaka leyi nga nhlamuselo ya kahle ya Kirby Muxloe Castle?,"The correct answer is **B: A ku laveka marhangu lamatsongo hikwalaho ka ku rhula ka tiko hi nkarhi wa ku akiwa.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Hi ti lwela a ku laveka ntsena eka mavutho lamatsongo ya vaphangi lava famba-fambaka."" (It became involved and suffered from the troubles of wandering people.)
* **Option B directly reflects this statement.** The castle was vulnerable to attacks due to its relatively peaceful state when it was initially built.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Makhumbi yo anama ya khokholo a ma komberiwe hi Hosi Hastings:** While historically accurate, this doesn't explain *why* the castle was vulnerable. The text doesn't link the destruction of the buildings directly to the initial building by Hastings.
* **C: Ku akiwa ka khokholo a ku nga faneli nkarhi wolowo:** The text doesn't imply that the castle was built at an inappropriate time.
* **D: A ri akiwa ku sivela nhlaselo lowu nga lunghiseleriwa:** This is a restatement of a fact from the text, but it doesn't explain *why* the castle later faced trouble.



"
I swiphemu swihi swa ku akiwa eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta tekiwa swi nga faneleki Kirby Muxloe Castle enkarhini lowu nga hlamuseriwa eka ndzimana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku akiwa loku nga ta sivela minhlaselo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mafisitere lamakulu lama nga funengetiwa ya rona ni makhumbi yo lala a nga ta swi kota ku sivela hi nkarhi wo leha nhlaselo lowu nga lunghiseleriwa."" This translates to ""Its large windows and sleeping chambers could be damaged by a time of inexplicable hardship."" This directly points to the possibility of damage from some sort of unspecified hardship or disaster.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mafasitere lamakulu (Large windows):** While windows *could* be damaged, the passage focuses on the *cause* of damage, not the windows themselves.
* **C: Marhangu lamatsongo ku hundza makhokholo man’wana (Bandit raids and the death of many people):** The passage mentions bandit raids, but the primary focus is on the damage that *could* occur due to an inexplicable hardship, not the raids themselves.
* **D: Makhumbi yo lala (Sleeping chambers):** Similar to windows, sleeping chambers *could* be damaged, but the passage focuses on the potential cause of that damage.



Therefore, **B** is the best answer because it directly reflects the potential damage described in the passage in relation to a mysterious hardship."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta va vuyelo lebyikulu eka munhu wa ku tsutsuma loyi a nga lunghiselela nkarhi lowu taka wa ku tsutsuma?","The correct answer is **D: Ku tirhisa ndhawu ya vutiolori ku endla vutiolori bya miri wa le henhla.**

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Ku tsutsumanyana eka ti ndhawu ta ntumbuluko hi nkarhi wa xixika, swin’we ni ku endla vutiolori bya miri wa le henhla, hi yona ndlela ya ku lunghiselela nkarhi wa ku tsutsuma."" This translates to ""Driving in busy areas during peak hours, as well as doing pre-trip checks, is the way to prepare for the travel time.""

Option D directly reflects the ""pre-trip checks"" mentioned in the passage.  Pre-trip checks, including checking tire pressure, are crucial for a safe and successful long drive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku titoloveta ku tsutsuma eka tindhawu ta ntumbuluko hi ximumu** (Avoid driving in busy areas during peak hours): While avoiding busy areas *helps* with travel time, it's not a *vuyelo lebyikulu* (major preparation) for someone who *has already planned* their travel time.  The question asks what prepares someone who has already planned.
* **B: Ku dzika eka ku dyondza ku va ni rivilo hi nkarhi wa vutiolori** (Checking and planning for visibility during the pre-trip check): While visibility is important, it's not the overarching preparation method highlighted in the passage.
* **C: Ku hundza nkarhi wa timinete tinharhu** (Saving time with extra minutes):  This is a minor adjustment, not a major preparation method.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided text.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka swa nkoka ngopfu eka munhu loyi a tsutsuma hafu ya mayile ya xiyimo lexi tlakukeke?","The correct answer is **A: Ku titoloveta ku tsutsuma eka tindhawu ta ntumbuluko hi xixika.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku tsutsumanyana eka ti ndhawu ta ntumbuluko hi nkarhi wa xixika, swin’we ni ku endla vutiolori bya miri wa le henhla, hi yona ndlela ya ku lunghiselela nkarhi wa ku tsutsuma.""

This translates to: ""There is a need to practice driving in busy areas at rush hour, as well as practice parking at heights, as a way to prepare for the time of driving.""

Option A directly reflects this statement about practicing driving in busy areas during peak hours.  The other options are either things that *result* from the practice (like not needing two minutes) or things that are *being considered* (like needing to analyze the vision), but not the active, necessary step described.

"Eka munhu wa ku tsutsuma, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga ta fikeleriwa ntsena hi ku dya kahle?","The correct answer is **A: Ku antswa ka vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma**.

Here's why:

The question asks what happens to a person who eats well and wants to be a good swimmer. The text states that eating well helps *prevent* swimming cramps (""Ku dya kahle ntsena a ku nge endli munhu a tsutsume kahle ngopfu, kambe ku yi khumba ngopfu vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma eka vatsutsumi la vantshwa""). Option A directly reflects this preventative effect.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ku tsakela hi ndlela leyi engetelekeke:** This relates to cramps occurring *during* swimming, not the preventative effect of good nutrition.
*   **C: Vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma bya xiyimo xa le henhla:** This refers to old age-related cramps, which is not the primary focus of the text.
*   **D: Ku tshama u tiyerile hi ndlela leyinene:** While staying hydrated is mentioned as part of good swimming practice, it doesn't directly address the preventative effect of eating well.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nga riki ndlela leyi nga ringanyetiwa ya vatsutsumi lavantshwa leswaku va tsakela ntlango wa vona hi laha ku engetelekeke?","The correct answer is **B: Va tshama va antswisa vuswikoti bya ku tsutsuma byi va bya xiyimo xa le henhla.**

Here's why:

The question asks what happens to rescued animals *after* they are rescued, leading to them potentially being afraid of humans. The passage states that successful rehabilitation involves things like proper nutrition, hydration, understanding natural foraging behaviors, and *understanding the fear that rescued animals have of humans.*

Option B directly addresses this by saying the animals learn about the fear of humans. This aligns perfectly with the passage's emphasis on understanding and addressing the fear that can develop in rescued animals.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ku dya kahle (Eating well):** While important for recovery, eating well doesn't directly address the *fear* of humans.
* **C: Ku nwa mati kahle (Drinking well):** Similar to eating well, hydration is crucial but doesn't target the fear issue.
* **D: Ku tshama u ri ni ku ringanisela ka matimba (Being strong):** Strength is a result of good care, not a direct response to overcoming fear.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini mutsutsumi wa ndhawu leyi nga lehanga naswona yi nga komanga a nga xavaka xitirhisiwa lexi durhaka ngopfu?","The correct answer is **C: Xi ta cinca ndlela leyi va nga vatsutsuma ha yona**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Switirhisiwa swi nga xaviwa hi ndlela leyi swi laveka ha yona, kambe swi yi cinca ka ntsongo kumbe swi nga yi cinci ndlela leyi munhu a tsutsu ma ha yona.""  This directly translates to: ""The tools can be used in a way they were intended, but they can drastically change or change the way a person travels.""

Option C accurately reflects this statement. The passage is describing how a broken tool alters the path or method of travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I leswi va swi lavaka (It is what they like):**  While the passage mentions what people *intended* to do with tools, it doesn't say they *like* things a certain way.
* **B: Xi nga va pfuna (It might be needed):** The passage doesn't mention that broken tools are *needed*.
* **D: Swi tele swilo leswi nga riki ntiyiso leswi vuriwaka hi xitirhisiwa lexi nga durhiki (It replaces things that are not correct according to what is said about the broken tool):** The passage doesn't say that broken tools *replace* anything. It emphasizes how they *change the way travel occurs.*



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku laveka yini leswaku u tsutsuma eka ndhawu leyi nga lehanga naswona yi nga komanga?","The correct answer is **A: Switirhisiwa swo tala (Original equipment)**.

Here's why:

The question describes a situation where trying to repair a part that's not supposed to be opened causes damage. The text then mentions that replacing the damaged part with a *new* one is often a solution. This implies the original part is the key issue.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Ku va ni ndhavuko wa mintlango lowu nga humelela (A tendency of the corridors to spread):** This doesn't relate to the described problem of damaging a part while trying to fix it.
*   **C: Switirhisiwa leswitsongo ngopfu (Highly specialized equipment):** While specialized equipment *could* be involved, the core of the problem seems to be the inherent design or vulnerability of the original part.
*   **D: Mali yo tala (Initial money):**  This has nothing to do with the technical problem described.



Therefore, the original equipment is the most logical answer."
I mani loyi a nga kuma nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch na Purcell**.

The passage states: ""MRI yi sekeriwe eka swiendlakalo leswi vonakaka leswi vuriwaka nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), leyi kumiweke hi va 1930 hi Felix Bloch (a tirha eYunivhesithi ya Stanford) na Edward Purcell (ku suka eYunivhesithi ya Harvard)."" This directly indicates that both Bloch and Purcell discovered nuclear magnetic resonance.
"
Hi lembe rihi laha ku nyikeriweke patente ya ku sungula medical imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Hi 1970, Raymond Damadian... u nyikiwe patente, leyi yi veke yo sungula ku humesiwa eka dyondzo ya MRI."" This translates to ""In 1970, Raymond Damadian... was granted a patent, which marked the beginning of MRI research.""

Therefore, the patent was granted in **1974**, not 1977 or 1930.  The 1977 mention is about the creation of the first MRI scanner, not the patent.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi vanhu va faneleke va swi twisisa ngopfu leswaku va kota ku twisisa swiendlo swa vanhu van’wana?","The correct answer is **B: Leswi va swi lavaka**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku twisisa leswi vanhu va swi lavaka i swa nkoka ngopfu."" (Understanding what people like is very important.)  The entire passage focuses on understanding desires, motivations, and what drives people's actions.  Understanding what someone *likes* is a core component of understanding their actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Leswi va nga swi navela** (Things they dislike): While understanding dislikes can be helpful, the passage emphasizes understanding *likes* more.
* **C: Leswi va swi tshembaka** (Things they fear):  Fear is a powerful motivator, but not the central theme of the passage.
* **D: Leswi va nga swi anakanya** (Things they hate): Similar to dislikes, the passage focuses on the positive aspects of understanding desires.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku twisisa leswi va swi lavaka ku pfuna vanhu leswaku va endla yini?","The correct answer is **D: Ku kota ku vona leswi vanhu van’wana va swi anakanyaka.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vanhu va swi anakanyaka, va swi lavaka, va swi tshembaka, va swi tivaka kumbe ku swi navela.""  This means people have desires, preferences, and motivations.  

The question asks what understanding what people like allows us to do. The passage explains it allows us to ""vona leswi vanhu van’wana va swi anakanyaka"" (see what others desire).

Option D directly reflects this understanding.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku susa ku nga tiyiseki hi swiendlo** (Avoid things that are not in line with behavior) - This is not directly linked to understanding what people like.
*   **B: Ku vhumbha leswi va nga swi navela** (Disapprove of what they are not used to) - This is about disapproval, not understanding desire.
*   **C: Ku languta vanhu van’wana handle ka ku avanyisiwa** (Analyze other people in order to be used) - This is about manipulation, not understanding preference.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga nkatsakanyo lowu kongomeke hi xikongomelo-nkulu xa AI?","The correct answer is **D: Ku endla mintirho (Performing tasks)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AI's ability to mimic human intelligence means it can ""endla swilo leswi lavaka mikhuva ya vutlhari"" (do things that require human intelligence).  The options relate to tasks AI can perform. While AI can *use* data (ku vona rito), *organize* data (ku longoloxa), and *manage* data (ku hlela), the core implication of AI's advanced capabilities is that it can *perform a wide variety of tasks*.  The passage lists examples like controlling, organizing, and resolving issues, all of which are task-oriented.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ko tala swi fambisiwaka ni AI?","The correct answer is **A: Vuswikoti byo hlamula swivutiswo swa vaxavi (Problem-solving for user queries)**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""Swikombiso swi katsa ku lawula, ku hlela na ku longoloxa, **vuswikoti by hlamula swivutiso swa vaxavi**..."" (Capabilities include controlling, organizing, and releasing, **problem-solving for user queries**...). This directly aligns with option A.

While other options are mentioned in the text as capabilities of AI, option A is the most directly and specifically stated in relation to what AI *does*.

Here's why:

The text states that people with this type of problem (difficulty regulating emotions) often use scientific approaches and methodologies.  This implies they are actively seeking solutions and finding ways to address the problem effectively. Option A directly reflects this by suggesting they are finding ""early, effective solutions.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ku tirhisa tindlela letintshwa eka xiphiqo (Using more unconventional methods for the problem):** While they might *use* unconventional methods, the text emphasizes a scientific approach, not necessarily unconventionality.
* **C: Va teka nkarhi wa vona ku tlhantlha xiphiqo (They take their time to analyze the problem):** The text mentions scientific approaches and methodologies, suggesting a more active and potentially faster approach than simply ""taking their time.""
* **D: Va swi kota ku nhlokohata muxaka wa miehleketo (They can manage the emotional problem):**  While managing the problem is a *result* of finding solutions, the core of the question asks what *happens* as a consequence of their scientific approach.  Finding solutions is the direct consequence.

Here's why:

The passage states that the key to overcoming addiction is to find *one* alternative to the addictive behavior. Options B, C, and D describe *aspects* of addiction or consequences *of* addiction, but they don't address the core solution presented in the text – finding a single, alternative coping mechanism.  The passage explicitly says the solution is to ""find one alternative."" Therefore, understanding and accepting that *one* alternative is necessary is the logical next step.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga ta tekiwa yi ri ku fambisiwa ka xikandza loku tekaka timilisekoni to hlayanyana?","The correct answer is **A: Ku languta etlhelo loku u vulavula (Analyzing the beginning of speech)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that when speech is slowed down by milliseconds, it becomes difficult to understand. This difficulty arises because the initial stages of speech processing are crucial for comprehension.  Slowing it down disrupts the natural flow and timing of the speech, making it hard to analyze the *beginning* and therefore understand the meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ku khwanyanisa xikandza (Synchronizing the rhythm):** While rhythm is important, the primary issue highlighted is the difficulty in analyzing the *content* at the beginning.
*   **C: Ku tsopeta hi xihatla (Focusing intently):**  Intense focus doesn't overcome the fundamental problem of disrupted speech timing and initial processing.
*   **D: Ku pfumela (Predicting):** Prediction relies on understanding the speech, which is hindered by the slow-down.



Therefore, option A accurately reflects the main problem described in the text."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngopfu-ngopfu, ku vuriwa leswaku munhu a nga swi kota ku vona loko munhu a hemba hi ku twisisa ku languteka ka xikandza kahle."" This directly translates to ""Often, it is said that a person cannot see when a person is trembling with good perception of the joint.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tirhisiwa ka vhidiyo ku vange mintshubulo ya nkoka:** While the passage mentions video and important findings, this isn't the *main* point being questioned.
* **C: Ku twisisa mavulavulelo ni ku languteka ka xikandza:** The passage focuses on the *visual* aspect of trembling and how it relates to perception, not the broader understanding of speech and joint perception.
* **D: Ku kota ku kambisisa leswi humaka embilweni hi ku kongoma:** This describes a phenomenon mentioned *in relation to neurological conditions*, but it's not the core question being asked about the limitations of perceiving micro-tremors.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga va swa nkoka ngopfu hikwalaho ka Ndzhundzunuko? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ku hangalasiwa ka vutivi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Entiyisweni, Ndzhundzunuko wu endle ku cinca lokukulu eka ndlela ya ku dyondza ni ku hangalasiwa ka vutivi"" which translates to ""Essentially, Ndzhundzunuko has made a major change in the way knowledge is acquired and understanding is developed.""  This directly links Ndzhundzunuko to changes in how understanding/knowledge is grasped.  While the other options are mentioned as *aspects* of the changes,  ""Ku hangalasiwa ka vutivi"" (understanding/grasping knowledge) is the most encompassing and directly related consequence mentioned.
"
"Hikwalaho ka Ndzhundzunuko, a ku kandziyisiwa yini katsongo eka leswi landzelaka?","The correct answer is **D: Ku hangalasiwa ka rungula**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Entiyisweni, Ndzhundzunuko wu endle ku cinca lokukulu eka ndlela ya ku dyondza ni ku **hangalasiwa ka vutivi**."" This translates to ""In essence, Ndzhundzunuko greatly changed the way of learning and **information processing**.""

Therefore, the passage directly links Ndzhundzunuko's impact to changes in information processing. The other options are either effects *of* the changes or related concepts but not the primary focus of the change itself.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombiki nhlohlotelo wa ku tirhisa inthanete eka vuxaka lebyi hambetaka?,"The answer is **A: Ku hlangana hi mabindzu (Meeting in forums)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes online interactions that are considered problematic, specifically:

*   **""Ku dyondza"" (Trolling)** and **""ku hanyisana"" (Argumentation)** are identified as forms of online harassment.
*   **""Ku katseka ka munhu"" (Personal attacks)** and **""vuxaka lebyi hambetaka"" (Derogatory language)** are defined as abusive communication.

The question asks what wouldn't be considered problematic online. Meeting in forums (ku hlangana hi mabindzu) is a common and often positive aspect of internet use. Forums facilitate discussion and connection around shared interests, and are not inherently associated with harassment or abusive communication like the other options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku tshama u vulavurisana ni ndyangu (Talking to strangers):** While it can carry risks, talking to strangers *can* be a positive experience and doesn't automatically equal harassment.
*   **C: Ku lavisisa hi ku teka maendzo (Seeking redress/Taking action):** Seeking redress is a way to address problems, but it is not inherently problematic online.
*   **D: Ku hlangana ni vanhu lavantshwa (Meeting diverse people):** Meeting diverse people is generally a positive thing and doesn't inherently constitute online harassment.



Therefore, the answer is **A**."

Here's why:

The passage discusses online interactions leading to negative behaviors like aggression and harassment.  Option B directly relates to this.  Creating content to provoke or antagonize others within online discussions is a common form of online harassment and fits the theme presented.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ku lava rhisipi (Looking for recipes):**  This is a completely neutral online activity and not related to the topic of online harassment.
* **C: Ku lavisisa switirhisiwa swa nhlayiso wa rihanyo (Testing software for crime prevention):** While related to online safety, this isn't a *behavior* that *causes* online harassment. It's a preventative measure.
* **D: Ku lawula timali (Managing money):**  Another neutral activity with no direct connection to the passage's focus on negative online interactions.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Misava yi cincile hikwalaho ka leswi vanhu va antswiseke sayense na thekinoloji, naso swiphiqo swi ye switala hikwalaho ka ku andza ka vanhu na mahanyelo ya vulovolovo ya vanhu."" (The world has changed due to people's disagreement with science and technology, and vaccines are being developed due to human population growth and the advancement of human technology.)

This indicates that advances in human technology (specifically, human technology and population growth leading to vaccine development) are key to tackling the challenges related to vaccine development and effectiveness.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ku yima ni lava lwelaka ku sirheleriwa ka mbango:** While seeking protection is a natural instinct, it doesn't address the *cause* of the problem (vaccine effectiveness).
* **C: Ku kuma rimitsu ra swiphiqo:** Understanding vaccine science is important, but it's not the direct solution to ensuring vaccine effectiveness.
* **D: Ku va vaseketeri va mbango:** Being a vaccine advocate is beneficial, but it doesn't solve the underlying issues affecting vaccine effectiveness.



Therefore, option A directly addresses the cause and potential solution mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hi nga yima ni lava lwelaka ku sirheleriwa ka mbango, naswona hi nga tlhela hi va vaseketeri va mbango leswaku hi hunguta ku xaniseka eka vumundzuku."" This directly translates to: ""We can join those who want to be rescued by the ocean, or we can become supporters of the ocean in order to ensure sustainability for future generations.""  This describes a direct action to protect the ocean.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ku tsuvula rimitsu ra swiphiqo:** While related to understanding the ocean, it's not the *primary* action described as a direct response to the problem.
* **C: Ku vulavula leswi hleketiwaka hi mahanyelo ya vulovolovo ya vanhu:** This refers to the negative impacts of human activities, but not a solution.
* **D: Ku hanya hi ndlela ya xinghana na mbango:**  While related to sustainable practices, it's a broader statement and not the most specific action presented as a response.



Therefore, joining efforts to rescue/protect the ocean (Option A) is the most direct action mentioned in the text as a response to the problem.

The text explicitly states: ""Nyimpi ya Xikhundlha xa ku Fuma ya Spaniya a ku ri masungulo ya nyimpi yo sungula leyi mhaka leyikulu ya yona a ku ri vulawuri lebyi pimiweke."" (The Spanish Armada was the beginning of the major war that was known as the War of the Spanish Armada).

Here's why:

* **The text highlights issues of power, wealth, and corruption within the Catholic Church.** It mentions that the Church amassed significant power and wealth, with financial resources used for personal gain rather than charitable purposes.  The text also points to corruption as a factor contributing to the decline of the Church.
* **The other options are less directly supported by the text:**
    * **B: Xana vupfumeri bya xisekelo byi fanele ku cinciwa** (Should basic doctrines be changed?) While doctrine is mentioned as a point of discussion, the text focuses more on the *application* of doctrine and the Church's failings in practice.
    * **C: Ku va ni matimba endzeni ka Kereke** (Is there power within the Church?) The text acknowledges power, but it also highlights how power was misused and led to corruption.
    * **D: Xana vupfumeri bya xisekelo bya Kereke a byi fikeleriwa** (Have basic doctrines of the Church been forgotten?) The text doesn't explicitly state that doctrines have been forgotten.



Therefore, the question about corruption directly reflects the problems and criticisms raised in the provided text.

The passage states: ""Xirho xa ntshungu u dziwite nhloko ya murindzi wa le vuhosini loyi a nga dlayiwa a Versailles emahlweni ka Nkosikazi yo chuha."" This translates to: ""The mob threatened the guard of the royal palace who would be attacked in front of the Queen.""

Here's why:

The question asks what happened *because* of Britain's sinking of German passenger ships. The text states: ""Britain yi cele mati ya matiko hinkwawo ku sivela swikepe hambi swi ri swihi ku nghena eka swiphemu hinkwaswo swa lwandle-nkulu, leswi a swi vangela khombo ni le swikepeni swa vukala-tlhelo. **Jarimani yi rindzele leswaku ku endleka leswi fanaka hi nyimpi ya yona yo kala swipimelo ya swikepe swa le hansi ka mati.**""

This translates to: ""Britain began to deploy minefields to sink passenger ships, which caused damage and loss of life. **Germany protested, saying that the actions were similar to its own sinking of passenger ships during its own war.**""

Therefore, Germany's reaction was to accuse Britain of using a similar tactic – sinking passenger ships –  by employing naval mines. Option A directly reflects this accusation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku vangela khombo ni le swikepeni swa vukala-tlhelo** - While this *was* a consequence of Britain's actions, it's not what Germany protested *because of*.
* **C: Ku cinca nawu lowu amukeriwaka hi vanhu hinkwavo** - This refers to the changing of the water depth, and is not directly related to Germany's protest.
* **D: Ku sivela switirhisiwa swa nkoka** - This describes what Britain *did*, not the reason for Germany's protest.



"
I swiga swihi leswi nga hlamuseriki kahle ku sivela ka Britain swikepe swa Jarimani?,"The correct answer is **A: Yi tlule nawu lowu amukeriwaka hi vanhu hinkwavo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Britain yi cele mati ya matiko hinkwawo ku sivela swikepe hambi swi ri swihi ku nghena eka swiphemu hinkwaswo swa lwandle-nkulu, leswi a swi vangela khombo ni le swikepeni swa vukala-tlhelo. **Jarimani yi rindzele leswaku ku endleka leswi fanaka hi nyimpi ya yona yo kala swipimelo ya swikepe swa le hansi ka mati.**""

* **This means:** Britain's actions (using German ship designs) were seen by Germany as a violation of their own wartime experiences and losses of ships.  The passage explicitly mentions this violation of historical context (""tlule nawu lowu amukeriwaka hi vanhu hinkwavo"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yi hlohlotele nyimpi ya Jarimani ya swikepe swa le hansi ka mati:** While Britain's use of the designs *relates* to Germany's losses, the passage doesn't say Britain directly targeted or mocked Germany's wartime losses.
* **C: Yi kavanyete ku nghena ka switirihisiwa swa Jarimani:**  The passage says Britain *used* German designs, not that they cleverly copied them.
* **D: Yi tiyisekise leswaku swikepe swa vukala-tlhelo swi va ekhombyeni:** The passage states the use of the designs led to shipwrecks, not that the ships were intentionally sunk.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani hakanyingi loyi a nga kamberiwaka Multiple Sclerosis?","The answer is **C: Wanuna loyi a nga ni malembe ya 43**.

The text states that women are twice as likely to get MS as men. While the text doesn't give a specific age, the options provided suggest a range.  A woman aged 43 is a common age for MS diagnosis, aligning with the general understanding of the disease's onset. The other options are less typical.

This translates to: ""People who are affected by the incidents want to be compensated in a way that allows them to compensate for the pain they have felt because they have been unable to move around well.""

The reason they want compensation is because of the **pain caused by the incidents** (vuvabyi bya miehleketo). The other options are related but not the direct reason stated in the passage.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, fensing yi tlangiwa njhani?","The correct answer is **A: Ntlango wa manguva lawa**.

Here's why:

* The first sentence of the paragraph states: ""Ntlangu wa manguva lawa wa fensing wu tlangiwa eka swiyenge swo tala..."" This means the fencing language is discussed in the context of modern times.
* The question asks *how* fencing is played. The passage describes its progression, but doesn't directly explain the rules or mechanics of *how* fencing is played in modern times.
* Options B, C, and D describe *where* fencing is practiced or *who* participates, not *how* it is played.

Therefore, option A is the only one that aligns with the overall topic presented in the initial sentence.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga ta komba ngopfu leswaku ku ni chefu leyi ngheneke endzeni?","The correct answer is **B: Ku hlanta ni ku dzuka nyuku**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Swikombiso, swo fana na ku hlanta swi kombisa leswaku xikambelo a xi nge endliwi hi nkarhi wolowo."" (Signs, like mold, indicate that the food was not stored properly.)
* **Option B (Ku hlanta ni ku dzuka nyuku - Mold and buzzing flies):**  Mold growth and the presence of flies are strong indicators of spoilage and bacterial/fungal activity, which are common signs of food poisoning.
* **Option A (Ku hlamba timbilu na ku hisa ka miri - Slimy surfaces and mold):** While mold is mentioned in the first statement, slimy surfaces aren't as directly linked to food poisoning as mold *and* flies.
* **Option C (Swirhumbana leswikulu ni xitlhavi ekhwirini - Large swelling and pus in the wound):** This describes signs of infection in a wound, not food poisoning.
* **Option D (Khontayina ya mirhi - Moldy container):** A moldy container *can* indicate the food was stored poorly, but it doesn't definitively prove the food itself is contaminated and causing food poisoning.  It's a *possible* sign, but not as strong as mold and flies on the food.

Therefore, the most direct and compelling signs of food poisoning, according to the given information, are mold *and* flies.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini goza ra ku sungula leri faneleke ra ku kamba munhu loyi a kumeke khombo?","The correct answer is **A: Kambisisa eka ndhawu ya khombo**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Ku Kamba munhu loyi a kumeke khombo, u fanele u rhanga hi ku kambisisa eka ndhawu leyi ya khombo leswaku u tiyiseka hi ku hlayiseka...""  This directly translates to ""When you need to help someone who has fallen, you should first take them to the place where they fell because they will be comforted.""

Option A accurately reflects this first step.  The other options describe actions that may follow, but not the initial and most important action.
"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombiki hi ku kongoma ndlela ya ku kamba munhu loyi a kumeke khombo?,"The correct answer is **A: U nga karhateki hi ku vaviseka ka wena** (You might get angry if you get upset).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loko u vaviseka u karhi u ringeta ku pfuna, u nga endla xiyimo xi nyanya ngopfu."" This translates to ""When you get upset, you might do many things.""  Option A directly reflects this potential consequence of getting upset – anger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kambisisa ndhawu ya khombo u nga si ya eka munhu loyi a kumeke khombo** (Show the location of the wound but do not go to the person who is wounded): The passage explicitly says to show the wound to the person who is wounded.
* **C: Xiya ku yima ka munhu loyi a weriweke hi khombo** (Stand by the person who is wounded): The passage states to stand by the wounded person and comfort them.
* **D: Ringeta ku vona xin’wana ni xin’wana lexi ku lemukisaka** (Look at other people who are comforting): The passage suggests looking at other people who are comforting as an example, but it doesn't say you *must* do this.  The main focus is on comforting the person who is wounded.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
I ku cinca kwihi loku nga hlohloteriwa hi Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Furwa loku nga ni nkucetelo lowukulu eka vatirhi?,"The correct answer is **A: Nseketelo lowukulu etikweni (Economic independence)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a shift in governance where power is moved from a monarchy towards a republic, and the country becomes driven by its people, not a single ruler. This implies a focus on the well-being and self-sufficiency of the nation.  The passage mentions the rise of military leaders, but this is presented as a consequence of the shift, not the core issue.

The key concern the monarch would have is maintaining economic stability and independence for the country in this new system.  The other options describe aspects of the political transition, but not the primary concern for the monarch's potential vulnerability.



Therefore, the monarch's biggest concern, given the described changes, would be the **economic independence** of the nation.



"
"Endzhaku ka Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Furwa, ku humelela eka vusocha ni mintirho yin’wana a swi nga endleki ngopfu leswaku swi sekeriwa eka yini?","The correct answer is **B: Mintlawa**.

The passage states: ""Nakambe endzhaku ka Nhlunga-vuhosi mintirho a yi pfulekele valavi va ntirho va xinuna hinkwavo swi pfumela lava wu navelaka swinene ni lava humelelaka ku ya emahlweni."" This translates to: ""Later, after the President, the departments appointed officials from among the best candidates, which resulted in some rising significantly and others moving on to higher positions.""  The sentence implies that the appointments were made based on merit and that officials were promoted.  This points directly to the word ""mintlawa"" (appointments/officials).
"
I ndlela yihi leyi tirhisiwaka ya ku famba leyi nga tisa swirilo ngopfu eka matiko lama fumeke?,"The correct answer is **C: Swilo swa ku fambisa vanhu**.

Here's why:

The question asks what has caused the fivefold increase in the transport industry. The text states: ""Hikwalawokahini swilo swa ku fambisa vanhu swi tisa swirilo swo tano..."" which translates to ""In recent times, the transport industry has caused a fivefold increase...""

The other options are mentioned as *causes* of illness, but the question is specifically about the *increase* in the transport industry.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga vuriwa hi swilo swa ku fambisa vanhu?","The correct answer is **C: Swi vanga swirilo ngopfu eka lava va swi tirhisaka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hikwalawokahini swilo swa ku fambisa vanhu swi tisa swirilo swo tano..."" This translates to ""In the past, means of transporting people were quite difficult..."" This indicates that the means of transportation were burdensome and challenging for those who used them.
* **Options A and B are incorrect:** The passage doesn't mention that they were ""popular"" or ""not very like working with water.""
* **Option D is incorrect:** The passage explicitly mentions findings from ancient remains showing people suffered from work related to water and carrying burdens.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the passage's implication that the methods of transportation were difficult and burdensome for the people who used them."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga tikaka ku swi vona hikwalaho ka ku nga tivi ndlela leyi vachayeri va tikhomaka ha yona?","The correct answer is **A: Rivilo ra nkwetlembetano**.

Here's why:

The passage states that if drivers don't follow the rules of the road, it can lead to inconsistent traffic patterns.  These inconsistent patterns are *reflected* in the traffic flow data (the ""rivilo"" - result/outcome). Therefore, the result of the traffic patterns is what is affected by drivers not following the rules.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku hleriwa ka ndlela (Road intersection)** While intersections are important, the passage focuses on the *result* of driver behavior, not the intersection itself.
* **C: Ku tirhisiwa ka ndlela (Use of a method)** The passage discusses methods of analyzing traffic, but not how the traffic patterns *themselves* are affected.
* **D: Nkhuluko wa Nkwetlembetano (Traffic flow principle)**  The passage discusses the principles of traffic flow, but the question asks about the *consequence* of drivers not following them. The consequence is seen in the data.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tirhisiwaka loko ku kombisiwa nkwetlembetano hi mathematiki?,"The correct answer is **C: Mpfahampfarhuto wa ndlela (Road irregularity)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku kombisa kahle ndlela ya nkhuluko wa nkwetlembetano wa timovha, ku endliwe ntirhiswano eka swihlawulekisi swinharhu swa nkoka: (1) ku khuluka, (2)ntiko, (3) rivilo. Ku tirhisana loku ku pfuna loko ku kunguhatiwa, ku endliwa na ndlela leyi ti tirhisanaka ha yona tindhawo ta ndlela.""

This translates to: ""To effectively display the curvature of the road network, collaborations were established using essential tools: (1) roughness, (2) compactness, (3) irregularity. By analyzing this, a method for relating the locations of the road network is developed.""

The passage emphasizes *irregularity* as a key factor in accurately representing road networks mathematically.  The other options are not directly supported by the text.

* **A: Ku tirhisiwa ka ndlela (Using a method)** - While a method *is* used, the core point isn't just *using* a method, but what the method *reveals* – irregularity.
* **B: Ku tikhoma ka muchayeri (Driver's turning)** -  Turning is mentioned as one of the factors (compactness), but the overall focus is on the broader irregularity of the road network.
* **D: Ku tala ka nkwetlembetano (Road smoothness)** - The passage highlights *irregularity*, the opposite of smoothness, as crucial for accurate representation.



Therefore, **C: Mpfahampfarhuto wa ndlela (Road irregularity)** is the most accurate answer.



"
Hershey na Chase vatirhise yini leswaku va hoxa DNA ya vona? ,"The correct answer is **B: Xilo xa xitekela**.

Here's why:

* **Hershey and Chase's experiment** was designed to determine whether DNA or protein was responsible for the viral infection.
* **DNA is a nucleic acid containing phosphorus.**  Phosphorus is a key component of the DNA backbone.
* **Protein contains sulfur.** Sulfur is a key component of protein amino acids.
* By using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA and radioactive sulfur to label the protein, they could track which component entered the bacterial cells. Since only the phosphorus (and thus the DNA) entered the cells and caused infection, they concluded that DNA is the genetic material.

Therefore, the experiment relied on the presence of **xilo xa xitekela (phosphorus)** in DNA.



"
Leswaku ku cinca ka xitekela ku hundziseriwa eka vana ku titshege eka yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko tisele ku ri ta switsongwatsongwana**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ntsena ku cinca eka tisele ta rimbewu loku nga hundziseriwaka eka vana, kasi ku cinca eka tindhawu tin’wana ku vanga kufa ka tisele kumbe khensa.""  This translates to: ""However, it is possible to treat a rash on a chickenpox blister in children, but a rash in other places can lead to death or scarring."" The key here is that *chickenpox blisters* can be treated in children. The passage doesn't give a reason *why* they can be treated, but implies it relates to the chickenpox being contained to the blister.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nkoka wa xiphemu xa ti gene** (Genetic makeup): The passage mentions genetics but isn't focusing on it as the reason for treatability in children.
*   **C: Muxaka wa ku cinca ka xitekela** (The type of rash): While the passage refers to the type of rash, it's not the *reason* for the different outcomes.
*   **D: Loko ku cinca ka xitekela ku nga vanga kufa ka tisele** (When a rash can lead to death): This is what the passage says about rashes *outside* the chickenpox blister, but not about the blister itself.

Therefore, option A, that chickenpox blisters can be treated *because* the chickenpox is contained in the blisters, is the most accurate interpretation of the passage."
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, switandzhaku swo hambana swa ku cinca ka xitekela a swi titsheganga eka yini?","The correct answer is **C: Nkoka wa xiphemu xa ti gene lexi nga khumbeka.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to digest lactose (the sugar in milk) is determined by genes.  The key point is that the passage highlights a difference in the *gene* responsible for lactase persistence.  

* **Option A** is partially correct (it refers to genes), but it doesn't specify *what* aspect of the genes is different.
* **Option B** is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention that the lactose-digesting bacteria themselves are different.
* **Option D** refers to the *process* of digestion, not the underlying genetic reason for differences.

The passage directly contrasts the situation with cows (which have persistent lactase production) and humans (where it's often lost), linking the difference to the ""nkoka wa xiphemu xa ti gene lexi nga khumbeka"" (the inheritance pattern of the genes).  This implies a difference in the genetic code that controls lactase production.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xivangelo xa ku ri ha yini mindhavuko ya khale a yi ri ni timbuti?,"The correct answer is **A: A ti va nyika nyama**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eka mindhavuko ya khale a ti hlayiseriwa ku kuma meleka, voya, **nyama**, na dzovo."" (In ancient times, they were hunted for deer, wild goats, meat, and honey.)

Therefore, the ancient civilizations hunted for **meat**. Options B, C, and D are mentioned in the passage as things hunted, but not as the primary reason for the discovery of ancient artifacts.
"
Xikongomelo xa golufu i ku teka nhlayo ya le hansi ya yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku cikinya nhonga**.

The text states: ""Mutlangi loyi a nga na nhlayo ya le hansi yoba, kumbe **ku cikinya nhonga**, ku fikela ntlangu wu hela wa hlula."" This translates to: ""A player who doesn't have the necessary grip, or **doesn't avoid gripping**, will get a poor result.""
"
"Endhawini ya ku tlanga golufu, hi le kwihi laha mabyanyi ma tsemiwaka ma va lamatsongo?","The correct answer is **B: Eka rihlaza**.

The text states: ""Ntlangu wu tlangiwa emabyanyini, naswona mabyani lama nga ekusuhi na mbhova ma tsemiwa ya va lamatsongo naswona ya vitaniwa rihlaza."" This translates to ""The leaves are harvested in the bushes, and the bushes that are dry and the bushes with the stalks are also cut and called rihlaza.""
"
I yini xikongomelo-nkulu xa xikambelo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku kuma ndlela leyi misava hi tirhaka ha yona.**

The text states: ""Xikongomelo nkulu xa sayene i ku kuma ndlela leyi misava yi tirha ha yona hi ti ndlela ya sayense."" (The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through scientific methods.)

While options A, C, and D are all things that scientific methods *do*, they are not the *main goal* itself. The core purpose is to understand how the world operates.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi nga pfuniki ku kongomisa vulavisisi bya sayense?","The correct answer is **B: Ku xiya leswi endliwaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the scientific method is a way to understand how the world works through scientific approaches. It involves observation, experimentation, and analysis.  A key component of the scientific method is acknowledging and *rejecting* results that are not supported by evidence or that are flawed.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndlela ya sayense ntsena (The scientific method itself):** While the scientific method *is* fundamental, it's not the *reason* for scientific progress. It's the *process* that allows for progress.
* **C: Ku susa swilo leswi ehleketiwaka (Removing what is being tested):** This isn't a step in the scientific method.  It refers to the *subject* of the testing, not a procedural element.
* **D: Ku kambela (Calculating):** Calculation is a tool *within* the scientific method, but not the core reason for its success.

Therefore, the ability to discard unsupported or incorrect findings (i.e., ""ku xiya leswi endliwaka"" - to discard what doesn't work) is crucial for the scientific method to be effective and lead to accurate knowledge.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi leswi nga riki ntiyiso hi swihuhuri?","The correct answer is **A: Swihuhuri swi kota ku onha swilo hinkwaswo leswi hlanganaka na swona.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is *not* true about lightning?""
* **The passage states:** ""Swihuhuri swi kota ku onha swilo hinkwaswo leswi hlanganaka na swona."" (Lightning can cause various things to happen with it.)
* **The other options are true statements from the passage:**
    * B: ""Swihuhuri swi ba ndhawu leyitsongo loko swi pimanisiwa ni swidzedze swin’wana swa vukari"" (Lightning is a dangerous phenomenon when combined with other weather elements).
    * C: ""Swihuhuri swo tala swi teka nkarhi wa ku hundza tiawara tinharhu"" (Strong lightning takes time to extinguish).
    * D: ""Swihuhuri swin’wana swi na moya lowu nga fikaka eka 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300mph)"" (Strong lightning can reach winds of 480 km/h).

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* true about lightning, according to the passage, is that it cannot cause other things to happen with it.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma swihuhuri swo tala?","The correct answer is **A: Hi ntolovelo swi teka nkarhi wa ku hundza tiawara tinharhu** (They take time to change direction).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tipesenti timbirhi ta swihuhuri leswi swi na matimba ngopfu swi teka nkarhi wa ku hindza eka tiawara ti nharhu.""  This directly translates to ""Two percent of powerful tornadoes take time to change direction.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Swi na moya lowu fikaka eka 480 wa timayili hi awara** (They have a wind speed reaching 480 miles per hour): While the passage *does* mention wind speeds, it doesn't relate this directly to what happens *after* tornadoes change direction.
*   **C: Swi ba ndhawu leyikulu ku hundza swidzedze swin’wana sa vukari** (They are large enough to change other types of energy): The passage says they are large enough to change *other* types of energy, not that changing direction is a consequence of that size.
*   **D: Swi tsuvula misinya** (They open up cavities): While the passage mentions tornadoes open up cavities, this doesn't directly relate to what happens when they change direction.

Therefore, option A is the only one that is directly supported by the information in the passage."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi vanhu va sunguleke ku swi endla hi lembexidzana ra vu 16?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku endla titeleskophu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hambiswiritano, titeleskophu tama sungulo bya ntiyiso ti endliwe eYuropa..."" (According to correspondence, the invention of the telescope began in Europe...).  This directly links the invention of telescopes to the 16th century.  While lenses (tilense) are *used* in telescopes, the key action being described is the creation of the telescopes themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tirhisa tilense** (Using lenses) - This is true, but not the *primary* action described. The passage focuses on the creation of the telescopes.
*   **B: Ku andzisa swilo swi vonaka swi ri swikulu** (Magnifying large objects) -  This is a *result* of using lenses in telescopes, not the main action happening in the 16th century.
*   **C: Ku endla tilense** (Making lenses) - While lenses are important, the passage directly connects the 16th century to the creation of *telescopes* which *use* lenses.



"
I nkarhi wo tanihi kwihi vanhu va ri karhi va andzisa swilo swi vonaka swi ri swikulu?,"The correct answer is **B: Loko ku hela lembexidzana ra vu 16**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hambiswiritano, titeleskophu tama sungulo bya ntiyiso ti endliwe eYuropa loko ku hela lembexidzana ra vu 16.""  This translates to: ""However, telescopes and the scientific revolution were created in Europe during the 16th century.""

The question asks when people started using instruments to observe large things, and the passage directly links the invention of telescopes (which were used for observation) to the 16th century. Therefore, the answer is B.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, bakwa ra Muhammad ri nyika xifaniso xa njhani hi mimboyamelo ya yena ya moya?","The correct answer is **B: Pongo leri humaka ehandle ri nga pfuna ku anakanya.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Muhammad a tsakela swinene timhaka ta vutomi byi n’wana handle ka lebyi bya siku ni siku. A a nga heli ebakweni leri ri vitaniweke “Hira” a Ntshaveni ya “Noor” (rivoningo) leswaku a anakanya. Bakwa hi vu rona, leri tshameke ku fika nkarhi lowu, ri nyika xifaniso xo xiyeka xa mimboyamelo ya Muhammad ya moya. Entiyisweni, a swi olovi ku ri kuma nikatsongo hambiloko munhu a tiva leswaku ri kona.""

This implies that just as Muhammad sought solitude and meditation to connect with the divine (like the cave in Hira), the passage is drawing a parallel to the idea that a pure heart (a ""pongo leri humaka ehandle"" - a pure heart that moves within) seeks to connect with something higher.  The mention of meditation and seeking solitude is the key to understanding option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U teka ku rhula ku ri ka nkoka na ku tihambanisa ni van’wana** - While solitude is important, the passage emphasizes seeking a deeper connection (anakanya) and the process of divine inspiration (mimboyamelo ya moya).
*   **C: A lava nkarhi lowutsongo a ri wexe** - The passage doesn't mention a specific time to retreat; it highlights the ongoing practice of seeking connection.
*   **D: A vilerisiwa hi ku voniwa ni ku twiwa** - The passage explicitly says the opposite – that a pure heart seeks connection *without* being distracted by external validation (""A swi olovi ku ri kuma nikatsongo hambiloko munhu a tiva leswaku ri kona"").



"
"Hi ku hi ndzimana, nsimbi yi tirhisiwele yini ku sungula?","The correct answer is **A: Ti Crossties**.

The passage states: ""Ti Crossties ti sungule ku tirhisiwa ku nga si ya kwini leswaku ti khoma ndlela."" This translates to ""Cross ties began to be used without anything to prevent the road from being damaged.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tindhawu to famba tigolonyi (Tigolonyi)**: The passage mentions the ""Tigolonyi"" (roads) themselves, not what was used to prevent damage.
*   **C: Mavhilwa (Chips)**: Chips were a *result* of the roads being damaged, not something used to *prevent* damage initially.
*   **D: Swiporo (Paved roads)**: Paved roads were introduced later (1767), after the initial use of cross ties.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini mavhilwa ya tihunyi ma sive hi mavhilwa ya nsimbi?","The correct answer is **D: A ma onhiwa hi nsimbi ya swiporo**.

The passage states: ""Eku heteleleni, mavhilwa ya tihunyi ma sive hi mavhilwa ya nsimbi."" This translates to ""Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels."" The reason for this replacement is that the wooden wheels were being damaged by the road. Therefore, the iron wheels were introduced because the wooden ones were being worn away by the road.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi a xi vumba vanhu hi nkarhi wa Vuromanticism?","The correct answer is **C: Mikhuva**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *made* people feel something during the Romantic period. The text states: ""A mongweni wa Vuromanticism, ndhawu yi vumba vanhu, kambe hi ku famba ka nkharhi mikhuva ni ndhavuko yo fambisana ni ndhawo yoleyo yi humelerile..."" This translates to: ""The Romantic spirit made people feel things, but through the progression of epochs and a spirit that corresponded with the entire environment...""

The phrase ""hi ku famba ka nkharhi mikhuva"" translates to ""through the progression of epochs/times.""  Therefore, the feeling of the Romantic period was tied to the changing times and the environment. While the other options might be *aspects* of the Romantic period, the passage explicitly links the feeling to the progression of epochs/times (mikhuva).



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Milawu (Laws):** The text mentions laws being *imposed* later, not as the primary cause of feeling during the period.
* **B: Ntivo-misava (Worldly/Material things):** While the Romantic period often reacted *against* materialism, the passage focuses on broader societal and historical forces.
* **D: Ndhavuko (Tradition):** Romanticism often reacted *against* tradition, seeking something new.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombiki mianakanyo ya ntolovelo ya ku pima hi ku tirhisa thekinoloji? ,"The correct answer is **C: Thekinoloji yi khumba vanhu hi ndlela ya mfuwo.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Thekinoloji hi hala tlhelo yi “khumba” vanhu hi ndlela ya mfuwo, ematshan’weni yo kongomisiwa hi mahanyelo ya vanhu."" (Technology has a tendency to ""lure"" people in a deceptive way, often in situations commissioned by human authorities.)

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer:

* **A: Thekinoloji yi khumba vanhu hi ku ya hi mahanyelo:** While the passage discusses technology luring people, it's more specific in stating this happens in a *deceptive* way (""ndlela ya mfuwo"").  ""Hi ku ya hi mahanyelo"" (by going through stages) is too general.
* **B: Nhluvukiso wa thekinoloji a wu khumbiwi hi nhlohlotelo wa ndhavuko:** The passage mentions that the development of technology isn't solely dependent on progress, it is more about its effect on people.
* **D: Nhluvukiso wa thekinoloji a wu sekeriwanga eka nhlohlotelo wa politiki:** The passage *does* mention that the development of technology isn't solely dependent on politics.



Therefore, option C best reflects the direct statement in the passage about technology's deceptive influence.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga fambisaniki ni ku koka vurha?","The correct answer is **A: Mpfumawulo lowutsongo**.

The text states: ""Kususumeta vurha swi endla mpfumawulo lowutsongo..."" which translates to ""Taking a pulse results in a clear conclusion..."" 

The question asks what happens when a pulse isn't taken, and the text directly links not taking a pulse to a ""clear conclusion"" (implying a lack of clarity or information, and therefore a less accurate outcome). The other options describe the *correct* procedures for taking a pulse.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi fambisanaka ni mpfumawulo lowutsongo?","The correct answer is **B: Ku koka vurha**.

The passage states: ""Kususumeta vurha swi endla mpfumawulo lowutsongo, loko ku koka vurha ku ni matimba swinene kambe ku ni nsusumeto.""  This translates to: ""Taking a sample leads to a positive result, while drawing blood is powerful but with restraint.""  Therefore, drawing blood is the action that follows a positive result.
"
Masalela ya marhambu ma komba leswaku mavoko ma cince leswaku ma tirhiselwa yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tirhisiwa hi ndlela yin’wana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Masalela ya marhambu ya mavoko lama nga ni malembe ya timiliyoni timbirhi ku fikela eka timiliyoni tinharhu ma komba ku cinca loko ka voko ku suka eku fambeni ku ya eku ma tirhiseni hi ndlela yin’wana"" which translates to ""Fossil records of hands dating back millions to hundreds of thousands of years show that hand changes occurred as they evolved from walking to being used in other ways.""

Therefore, the fossils show a shift in how the hands were *used*, not just for walking, grasping, or climbing.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma voko ni nenge ta chimpanzi? ,"The correct answer is **D: Swi tirhisiwa hi ndlela yin’wana** (They were used in a different way).

Here's why:

The passage states that early hominids used their hands for walking, manipulating objects, and tool use. It also mentions that human hands evolved to be more precise and dexterous, allowing for more complex tasks.  The fact that human hands are not as similar to chimpanzee hands, but are still capable of tool use, indicates that the hands evolved to be used in a new and different manner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swi ololokeke ku hundza swa vanhu** (They were used for making tools): While tool use is mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically state that hands were *initially* used for making tools. It focuses on the evolution of their *use* over time.
* **B: Mavoko ni nenge a swi fani hi vukulu** (Hands are not very similar): The passage states that they are *not as* similar, implying a difference, but the main point isn't about the hands being drastically different.
* **C: Swi tirhisiwela ku rhwala ntiko** (They were used for walking): The passage states hands were used for walking initially, but their use evolved *beyond* just walking.

Ku hlawula ku susa ku hundzuka ka xiaki xa xitekela lexintshwa eka mpfangano wihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Lexi nga tumbela**.

The text states: ""Ku hundzuka ka swiaki swa xitekela ku engetela ku hambana ka xitekela, naswona ku hlawula ku swi susa eka mpfangano wa ku hamabana lowu **nga tumbela** ni lexi nga tirhisiwa.""

This translates to: ""The appearance of chemical impurities leads to chemical variation, and also causes them to be removed from the competing reaction, **which can be used**.""  The sentence directly links the removal of impurities to the 'lexi nga tumbela' (which can be used).
"
I ndlela yihi leyi tirhisiwaka ya ku engetela ku hambana ka xitekela?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku cinca ka xitekela**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku hundzuka ka swiaki swa xitekela ku engetela ku hambana ka xitekela..."" which translates to ""The disruption of the cycle of the plant introduces variation in the plant cycle...""  This implies that the variation is caused *by* a change or alteration in the plant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lexi nga hambanisiwa (That which is varied):** This is a consequence of the change, not the *method* of introducing variation.
* **B: Lexi nga hlanganisiwa kambe (That which is combined but):** While combining could happen, the passage focuses on the *change* as the primary driver of variation.
* **D: Lexi nga tirhisiwa (That which is used):**  This is too general and doesn't specifically address *how* the variation occurs.

Therefore, the disruption and introduction of variation in the plant cycle is achieved through **changing** the plant's characteristics.

"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga eka ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi faneleke swi dyiwa hi xihari lexi nga ni fambiselo ro gayela leri fanaka ni ra vanhu leswaku xi tlhantlha “xiphiqo xa tiphroteyini”?","The correct answer is **D: Swihlovo swa swimilana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku tlula kwalaho, ku tsandzeka ku endla tano ku ni vuyelo byo chavisa: ku nga kuli ku ya emahlweni, ku sika, naswona eku heteleleni rifu. Ku tsandzeka ku endla swihlovo swa swimilana leswi nga lunghekela ku kumiwa a ku ta va tiphroteyini leti nga eka matluka ni tinyawa, kambe leti ome ngopfu leswaku swiharhi swa ku fana na hina swi nga gayela handle ka loko swi nga swekiwa.""

This directly links the formation of abnormal growths (swihlovo swa swimilana) to the passage's discussion of how humans can develop a protein ""tumor"" similar to what chimpanzees in the wild do. The other options are either too general (matluka lama feke, tinyawa leti nga si swekiwa, majenje) or not specifically mentioned in connection with the protein tumor development.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiphiqo swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga vangiwiki hi ku nga kumi tiamino-asidi ta nkoka?","The correct answer is **A: Swiphiqo swa ku gayela (Malnutrition)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ehandle eribuweni, swa tika leswaku xihari lexi nga ni fambiselo ro gayela leri fanaka ni ra vanhu ri enerisa swilaveko xa xona xa tiamino-asidi leswi kumekaka eka swihlovo swa swimilana. Ku tlula kwalaho, ku tsandzeka ku endla tano ku ni vuyelo byo chavisa: ku nga kuli ku ya emahlweni, ku sika, naswona eku heteleleni rifu. **Swiphiqo swa ku gayela** swa swimilana leswi nga lunghekela ku kumiwa a ku ta va tiphroteyini leti nga eka matluka ni tinyawa...""

The passage then lists malnutrition (swiphiqo swa ku gayela) as one of the consequences of lacking essential amino acids. Options B, C, and D (Ku sika, Ku nga kuli ku ya emahlweni, and Rifu) are also listed as potential consequences, but ""Swiphiqo swa ku gayela"" is the overarching term for the general state of malnutrition. Therefore, **A** is the most comprehensive and accurate answer.
"
Swirho swa mintlawa ya ndhavuko leyi humaka eka ndhavuko lowukulu hakanyingi wu kombisa vuxirho bya vona njhani?,"The correct answer is **D: Hi ku tirhisa switayele tanihi mfungho**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hakanyingi wu kombisa vuxirho bya vona hi ndlela leyi hambaneke ni leyi faniselaka ku tirhisiwa ka switayele, leswi katsaka tifexeni, mikhuva ni ririmi ra xitsotsi.""

This translates to: ""Often shows their characteristics in a different way and which leads to the use of stereotypes, which causes tensions, misunderstandings and derogatory language.""

Therefore, the characteristics often shown are linked to the *use of stereotypes* as a way of understanding and interacting with the world.  Options A, B, and C are not directly supported by the passage.

"Hi ku ya hi dyondzo leyi nga kombisiwa eka ndzimana, ku nga endleka yini hi n’wana loyi a nga eka ntlawa lowutsongo wa rixaka lowu ku nga ni mavonelo lama hoxeke a leswaku va nghenelela eka mahanyelo lama xungetaka?","The correct answer is **B: Swi nga endleka leswaku n’wana loyi ko tala a nghenelela eka mahanyelo lama xungetaka.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""Vana lava nga eka ntlawa lowutsongo wa rixaka lowu ku nga ni mavonelo lama hoxeke hi wona ya leswaku a va tirhi kahle exikolweni kutani a va tirhi kahle exikolweni loko va twa mavonelo lama hoxeke hi rixaka ra vona.""  This implies that sometimes lack of early achievement leads to later success *when* they experience the expected achievements of their peer group.

* **The question asks:** What might happen to a child who is *not* meeting early achievement benchmarks, *if* they are exposed to high-pressure situations?

* **Option B** acknowledges the possibility that the child *might* start acting out (enghenelela eka mahanyelo lama xungetaka - acting out in challenging ways) due to the pressure, *but* it doesn't definitively state it *will* happen. This is the most nuanced and accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: N’wana u ta ringeta ku papalata ku nghenelela eka mahanyelo lama xungetaka:** This is too strong. While acting out is a possibility, it's not guaranteed and the prompt doesn't suggest it *will* occur automatically.  ""Ringeta ku papalata"" implies a deliberate choice, not necessarily a reaction to pressure.

* **C: N’wana a nge swi lavi ku va eka swiyimo laha ku na vanhu kona:**  While some children might be introverted and dislike social situations, this isn't directly related to the pressure of high expectations. The question specifically refers to exposure to ""high-pressure situations"".

* **D: N’wana u ta ala ku tihlanganisa ni mintlawa yin’wana leyitsongo ya rixaka:** This option is less relevant and doesn't logically connect to the scenario presented. It suggests seeking out other peer groups, which isn't the primary concern.



Therefore, **B** is the most reasonable and defensible answer based on the provided information.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, vutivi bya n’wana bya mavonelo lama hoxeke hi rixaka byi nga khumba yini eka leswi landzelaka?","The best answer is **A: Ntlawa lowutsongo wa rixaka lowu va hlawulaka ku fanisiwa na wona**.

Here's why:

The passage states that children who *don't* have a strong family connection (as indicated by strong family values) tend to perform better academically *when* they experience strong family connection. This suggests that the family connection is a predictor of academic performance. Therefore, if the family connection is strengthened (like a ""stronger foundation""), academic performance is likely to improve.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Mahanyelo ya vona (Their feelings):** While feelings might be influenced by family connection, the passage focuses more on the *impact* of family values on academic performance.
* **C: Vuxaka bya vona ni vana van’wana (Their communication with other children):** The passage doesn't mention communication with other children.
* **D: Nhlamuselo ya vona ya rixaka (Their family's influence/values):** While family values are important, the question asks about what the *result* might be when family connection *improves*.  The passage links stronger connection to better academic results.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the passage is that a stronger family connection will lead to a better academic foundation, mirroring the positive impact seen in the example.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga fambisaniki ni n’wana loyi a nga kula a pfaleriwa?","The correct answer is **C: Ku lava ku va voxe (Want to be alone)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Vana lava nga kula va pfaleriwa va nga ha va langutane ni ku khomiwa ko biha ngopfu ka vana kumbe ntshikelelo va nga si tshikiwa kumbe va baleka."" This translates to: ""Children who are ostracized often do not socialize and are not allowed to be around many children or have companions, or they run away.""  This indicates a desire for solitude and isolation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hanya va ri voxe (Go away alone):** While running away *can* be a consequence, the passage emphasizes a general desire for aloneness rather than specifically going away alone.
* **B: Vuswikoti bya ku burisana (Desire for revenge):** The passage describes negative experiences, but doesn't focus on a desire for revenge as a direct consequence.
* **D: Ku chava vanhu (To hurt people):** The passage describes abusive actions inflicted *on* the child, not the child inflicting harm on others.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma ku lava ku va voxe ka vana?","The correct answer is **C: Ku lava ku va voxe ku vonakala eka vana lava nga kula va pfaleriwa hi vatswari va vona.**

Here's why:

The text describes how children who are ""pfaleriwa"" (often meaning ostracized or isolated) due to parental issues face severe consequences.  It specifically states that children who are ""pfaleriwa va nga ha va langutane ni ku khomiwa ko biha ngopfu ka vana...va baleka"" (are not allowed to play with others and are often driven away). The text also mentions being ""kurisiwe hi swihari"" (sent to a boarding school) or ""hanye enhoveni"" (driven away).  Finally, it links the isolation to parental actions like sending the child to boardingschool or banishing them from their home.

Option C directly connects the desire for isolation to the experience of children ostracized by their parents.  The text *implies* that this isolation is a direct *result* of being ""pfaleriwa"" by parents, making C the most accurate answer.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i endlelo rihi eka lama landzelaka lama nga fambisaniki ni vurimi bya ku ti hanyisa i vurimi lebyi endleriwaka ku kuma swakudya leswi ringaneke?","The correct answer is **C: Ku dzika eka ntshovelo lowukulu ku hambana ni tindlela leti hluvukeke**.

Here's why:

The passage states that conventional farming often relies on methods that have been used for a long time, and it's often linked to the use of chemicals and genetically modified seeds.  This contrasts with the concept of diverse farming practices.  

Therefore, the most logical consequence of a farmer practicing diverse farming would be to share their methods and knowledge with others (the ""ntshovelo lowukulu"" - a wider community or group). This would involve discussing different approaches and techniques.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku dzika eka ntshovelo lowu fikelelaka swilaveko swa murimi ni ndyangu wa yena** - This is a bit vague. While a farmer might communicate with their family, it doesn't capture the wider implications of diverse farming.
*   **B: Ku humesa swakudya leswaku u xavisela van’wana** - This refers to sharing the *produce*, not the *methods* of farming.
*   **D: Ku tirhisiwa ka mbewu ya ndhawu yoleyo** - While using indigenous seeds *is* part of diverse farming, it's not the overarching consequence described in the passage. It's a specific practice *within* a broader approach.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamusela ya ku kongoma hi endlero ra vurimi bya ku ti hanyisa i vurimi lebyi endleriwaka ku kuma swakudya leswi ringaneke?,"The correct answer is **A: I endlelo ra ku kala tikhemikhali**.

Here's why:

The question asks what leads to the decline of conventional agriculture (which relies on monoculture - growing a single crop). The passage states: ""hakanyingi ro kala tikhemikhali..."" (often using chemicals...).  The use of chemicals is a major contributing factor to the decline of monoculture farming due to soil degradation, pest resistance, and other environmental problems.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ri tirhisa tindlela tin’wana to olova ta ku humesa swo tala swinene** (It uses other cultivation methods to produce initial yields). While this might be a *short-term* solution, it doesn't address the long-term problems associated with monoculture.
* **C: Ri pfumelela varimi ku avelana hi swibyariwa ni vanhu va ndhawu** (It allows farmers to share varieties and local people). This describes a beneficial aspect of traditional agriculture, not a reason for its decline.
* **D: Swa ha tirhisiwa hi varimi ematikweni man’wana** (It is not used by farmers in many countries). This is factually incorrect and doesn't relate to the question of *why* conventional agriculture is declining.



"
Ku vhakela muziyamu i muxaka muni wa vupfhumba?,"The correct answer is **B: Vupfhumba bya ku tihungasa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mabuwu, phaki yo tiphina eka yona na tindhawu to kampa eka tona i tindhawu leti nkarhi wun’wana ti endzelaka hi vapfhumba vo **tihungasa**."" (Dust, the dirt that accumulates on it, and the places that are dirty on it are places that are often created by **dust**.)

Museums are places where dust accumulates and needs to be cleaned. Therefore, the passage associates museums with dust, which is a type of fine particulate matter – a characteristic of **vupfhumba bya ku tihungasa (dust particles)**.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga xikongomelo-nkulu eka vapfhumbi byo tihungasa?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tipeta hi ndhavuko ya ndhawu yoloyo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that when people go to a new place and see things different from their daily lives (like buildings, parks, and places to camp), they experience a strong emotional response. This response is described as ""vupfhumba bya ndhavuko"" which translates to a feeling of nostalgia or longing for home.  Therefore, the core reason for this emotional response is *missing the familiarity and customs of their own place*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku wisa eka leswi va swi endlaka siku ni siku:** While this contributes to the new experience, it's not the *primary* cause of the strong emotional response described.
*   **C: Ku vona miako leyi hlawulekeke ya tiko:** This is a possible outcome, but not the fundamental driver of the emotion.
*   **D: Ku twisisa matimu ya ndhawu:** This is too broad and doesn't accurately reflect the specific emotional reaction described in the passage.

Therefore, option A most accurately reflects the central point of the passage regarding the strong emotional response experienced by people encountering new environments."
I yini leswi nga vuriwa eka ndzimana tanihi swilo leswi nga pfuneta ku hunguta ku chava ku cinca endzeni ka kereke ya kwalaho?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tsundzuka swilo leswi hundzeke swa mikhuva ya ku humelela ya van’wamabindzu.**

The text explicitly states: ""Eka xiyimo lexi, ku tsundzuka swilo leswi hundzeke swa mikhuva ya va n’wamabindzu..."" (In this situation, the events of the past of the afflicted people erupt...). This eruption of past events is what sparks the need for change within the church.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku kuma rungula ra vanhu lava kuceteleke ndhavuko wa nhlangano:** While understanding the history of the church is helpful, the text focuses more on the *eruption* of past events.
* **C: Ku kuma matimba lama fambisaka nhlangano:** Understanding the church's power is important for enabling change, but it's not the *cause* of the need for change as described in the text.
* **D: Ku twisisa matimu ya nhlangano:** Understanding the feelings of the church is a prerequisite for change, but the text highlights the *external events* that trigger the need for a shift in those feelings.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku twisisa matimu ya wena swi nga pfuna hi yini?","The correct answer is **C: Ku kuma laha munhu a nga wela eka nhlangano.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hambileswi ku twisisa matimu ya wena swi nga vuriki leswaku u ta twisisa ndhavuko, swa pfuna nyana leswaku munhu a vona leswaku **yena u wela kwini eka matimu ya nhlangano**.""  This directly translates to understanding emotions helps someone realize where they stand within the congregation. Option C captures this idea perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku hunguta ku chava ku cinca:** While change is a result of understanding emotions, the passage doesn't say the primary goal of understanding emotions is to *initiate* change.
*   **B: Ku tiyisa leswi hi swi rhandzaka:**  This is mentioned as a *result* of feeling connected to the congregation's values, not the primary reason for understanding emotions.
*   **D: Ku antswisa mahanyelo ya n’wamabindzu:**  This refers to addressing the problems of the past and the consequences that followed, which is a *result* of understanding emotions, not the goal of understanding emotions itself.

I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma minkarhi yo hundza eka dyondzo ya ximodeni?,"The correct answer is **C: Tindlela tin’wana ta ku dyondza ti antswa ku tlula tin’wana**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that traditional study habits are no longer effective. It highlights the need for innovative and engaging methods, referencing TV shows and real-world experiences as examples. The passage also mentions going on adventures and changing environments.  This all points to the idea that *other* study methods are now considered superior and more effective than the traditional, passive approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tindlela tin’wana ta ku dyondza leti hi hundzaka eka tona ti vuyerisa ku tlula tin’wana:** While this *could* be true, the passage doesn't explicitly state that other methods *always* come first. It mainly emphasizes the *ineffectiveness* of the traditional method.
* **B: Ku dyondza ku fanele ku dzika eka swilo leswi hi tshembaka leswaku hi ta hundza eka swona:** The passage actually *criticizes* this kind of study, suggesting it's outdated and doesn't lead to real understanding.
* **D: A ku na ntiyiso eku dyondzeni:** The passage directly challenges the validity of traditional study methods. It implies that there's a *lack* of efficacy in them.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombisiki hi ku kongoma minkarhi yo hundza eka ximodeni eka dyondzo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku dyondza ku titshege hi mudyondzi ni vutivi lebyi nga nyikeriwa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that effective studying requires dedicated time and skills.** It states, ""Ku dyondza ku humelela exikarhi ka mudyondzi ni vutivi lebyi tisiweke."" (Studying requires dedicated time and skills).
* **The passage then lists examples of *ineffective* studying** (watching TV, neglecting responsibilities, impulsive decisions).  This implies that a lack of dedicated time and skills leads to poor results.
* **Option C directly reflects this emphasis on the importance of dedicated time and skills in studying.** It highlights that studying relies on both discipline and learnable skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku ni tindlela to tala taku dyondza rungula (There are quick ways to study effectively).** The passage *contradicts* this by showing that quick fixes are often ineffective and lead to negative consequences.
* **B: Tindlela tin’wana ta ku dyondza leti hi hundzaka eka tona ti fanele ti rhangisiwa eka tin’wana (Other ways of studying that are neglected should be combined).** While combining study methods *can* be helpful, the primary focus of the passage is on the importance of consistent, dedicated study – not on combining neglected methods.
* **D: Vutivi lebyi i nga ta tshuka hi byi tirisa bya ha ri bya nkoka leswaku hi byi dyondza (Skills that are used to relax are not necessary for studying).** The passage implies that skills, including those used for relaxation or leisure, *are* important components of effective studying. It’s not about whether they’re necessary, but about the balance of disciplines and skills involved in learning.

"Endzhaku ka ku pfuka hi xikongomelo hi nkarhi wa wena lowu tolovelekeke wa ku etlela, i yini leswi nga ta nghenelela eka endlelo ra ku kavanyetiwa loko u etlela?","The correct answer is **B: Ku tirhisa xihambukelo ivi u tlhelela emubedweni.**

Here's why:

The passage describes how using a clock alarm to wake up at your regular departure time can be counterproductive because it can cause rushing and not fully waking up. It suggests placing the alarm clock across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.

Option B directly reflects this strategy. If you have to physically get up to turn off the alarm, it forces you out of bed and begins the process of waking up.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku hlaya awara ni hafu u nga si khomiwa hi vurhongo nakambe:** This doesn't align with the passage's description of the counterproductive nature of clock alarms.
*   **C: Ku tima alamu ya xikomba-nkarhi leyi nga etlhelweni ra mubedo ivi u khomiwa hi vurhongo endzhaku ka timinete ta makume-mbirzhi:** While the passage mentions placing the alarm across the room, it doesn't suggest waiting 22 minutes after it goes off to turn it off.
*   **D: Ku pfuka u nwa mati ebodlheleni leri nga etlhelweni ra mubedo:** This is mentioned as a *less effective* method and not a primary strategy for waking up properly. The passage focuses on the physical act of getting out of bed.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga riki nhlamuselo yo kongoma ya ku kavanyetiwa loku u etlele?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku nga sekeriwa eka endlelo ra ndzhendzheleko wa ntumbuluko**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Leswi swi nga endliwa hi ndlela yo olova hi ku tirhisa alamu ya xikomba-nkarhi leyi nga endliki huwa ngopfu leswaku yi ku endla u phaphama kambe yi nga ku pfuxi hi ku helela.""  This means that relying on a jarring alarm is *not* a good strategy and won't lead to a restful awakening.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Tindlela tin’wana ta endlelo ra ndzhendzheleko wa ntumbuluko ti katsa ku nwa swihalaki swo tala...""  This reinforces the idea that stimulating the body *before* waking up is counterproductive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xikongomelo i leswaku u nga pfuki hi ku helela:** While true, this describes a consequence, not a reason *why* the strategy fails.
* **C: Endlelo leri ri endleka hi nkarhi wa wena lowu tolovelekeke wa ku etlela:** This describes the *timing* of a failed strategy, but not the *reason* for its failure.
* **D: Endzhaku ka ku pfuka, xikongomelo i ku khomiwa hi vurhongo ku nga si hela tiawara timbirhi:** This describes a potential consequence of a *jarring* alarm (the ""vurhongo""), but it's not the core reason why relying on any stimulating strategy is ineffective.



Therefore, option A directly addresses the primary reason why the described strategies are unsuccessful – they don't address the underlying issues of sleep cycles and bodily preparation.

"Loko byongo byi ringeta ku endla milorho leyi u vonaka leswaku u yi lorha vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wana, i yini lexi engetelekaka?","The correct answer is **D: Nkarhi exikarhi ka swiyimo swa REM**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xivangelo lexikulu xa xiendlakalo lexi i vuyelo bya milorho leyi u vonaka leswaku wa lorha i ku kurisa ku leha ka nkarhi exikarhi ka swiyimo swa REM.""  This directly translates to ""The main mechanism of this phenomenon is the delay in the timing of REM sleep.""

The passage then explains that REM sleep is crucial for memory consolidation and that delaying it can lead to waking up feeling groggy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nhlayo ya swiyimo swa REM** (REM sleep duration): The passage focuses on the *timing* of REM sleep, not its duration.
* **B: Mpimo wa matimba** (Muscle tone): While muscle tone is important during sleep, the passage doesn't connect it to the grogginess experienced from delayed REM sleep.
* **C: Ku leha ka nkarhi wa xiyimo xa ku hlakarhela ka miri** (Delay in the timing of memory consolidation):  The passage links delayed REM sleep to grogginess, and delayed REM sleep *affects* memory consolidation. However, the most direct and specific answer is about the timing of REM sleep itself.



"
I switandzhaku swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga humelelaka emirini hikwalaho ka ku endla milorho leyi u vonaka leswaku wa lora vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hunguteka ka nkarhi exikarhi ka swiyimo swa REM**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Xivangelo lexikulu xa xiendlakalo lexi i vuyelo bya milorho leyi u vonaka leswaku wa lorha i ku kurisa ku leha ka nkarhi exikarhi ka swiyimo swa REM.""  This means the core mechanism of these sleep-like behaviors is related to premature activation of REM sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ti REM leti nga hunguteka vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wna:** While REM *does* happen throughout the night, the key is that it's happening *prematurely* in this case.
* **C: Ku titshega hi ku va ni milorho leyi u nga ti endla ku vona leswaku wa lora:** This is a description of the *symptoms*, not the *underlying mechanism*.
* **D: Ti REM leti engetelekeke vusiku byin’wana ni byin’wna:**  ""Engetelekeke"" (intermittent) doesn't accurately reflect the premature activation that's the core issue. It's about the *timing* of REM, not just whether it happens at all.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke ni mintlawa ya le ka inthanete yi fana njhani?","The correct answer is **C: Mintlawa havumbirhi yi rhamberiwa eka ntlawa lowu nga vonakiki.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ku va kona ka “ntlawa lowu nga vonakiki” wa ntiyiso (Larson na LaFasto, 1989, p109) I xiyenge xin’wana lexi hlawulekeke xa ntlawa wa le ka inthanete. “Ntlawa lowu nga vonakiki” I vurhangeri bya ntlawa lebyi vanhu hinkavo va rhangeriwaka kona. Ntlawa lowu nga vonakiki wu veka milawu eka vanhu va ntlawa.""

This means both traditional and cyberlaw are influenced by an ""invisible hierarchy"" or ""invisible power structure.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku languteriwa leswaku mintlawa havumbirhi yi tirha eka mpimo lowu fanaka** The passage suggests they *don't* operate within the same structure, but rather have a unique power dynamic.
* **B: Mintlawa havumbirhi yi na mpimo lowu hambaneke wa ku kota ku ti ehleketela eka leswi yi swi endlaka siku ni siku** While cyberlaw is constantly evolving, the passage doesn't focus on the difference in their adaptability. The key difference highlighted is the ""invisible hierarchy.""
* **D: Mintlawa havumbirhi yi tirha hi minkarhi leyi fanaka ya matiko** The passage doesn't mention similarities in the timing of legal changes.

* **A: Mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke yi tekiwa yi ri ya matirhelo ya le henhla** - While true, this doesn't explain *why* there are problems with applying them to the internet.
* **B: Mintlawa ya le ka inthanete yi tirha tanihi ndhawu yo hlangana ya mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke** -  This is partially true, but it doesn't address the core issue of how the *timing* of technological advancements creates problems.
* **C: Mintlawa leyi tolovelekeke yi na vuswikoti bya ku ti ehleketela lebyi nga ehansi ku hambana ni mintlawa ya le ka inthanete** -  While there *are* discrepancies, the passage focuses on the *timing* and evolution of technology, not just general discrepancies.

I yini leswi ku nga dzikiwiki eka swona eka leswi landzelaka hi mavonelo ya vanhu vo tsala marungula?,"The best answer is **C: Swilaveko swa le ndzeni (Internal consequences)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt focuses on how needs influence behavior and consequences.** It specifically mentions how unmet needs can lead to feelings of illness and how people react when their needs are met or unmet.

* **Option C, ""Swilaveko swa le ndzeni,"" directly addresses the internal consequences.** This aligns with the prompt's focus on the *internal* effects of unmet needs, such as feeling ill, frustration, or dissatisfaction. This is crucial to understanding the repercussions of the hierarchy of needs.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Leswintshwa leswi va swi navelaka leswi nga endzeni ka vona loko va wupfa va kula (The changes they experience internally when they feel sick):** While internal changes *are* a consequence, option C is more encompassing.  Option C includes feeling sick as one aspect, but also other internal responses.

* **B: Ndlela leyi ndhawu ya vona yi khumbaka swiendlo swa vona (The way their mind remembers their actions):** This refers to memory and cognitive processing, not direct consequences of needs being unmet.

* **D: Ku twisisa leswi tsakisaka vanhu (Understanding the people who offend them):**  This relates to social dynamics and offense, not the immediate internal consequences of unmet needs.



Therefore, **C** is the most appropriate answer as it directly addresses the internal repercussions of unmet needs, which is the core theme of the question.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xitirhisiwa xa nawu wa ku veka swiyenge swa nkoka ku sungula?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku endla leswaku ku va ni ku tshamiseka eka xifaniso.**

Here's why:

The question describes a problem with the autofocus system on a camera. Specifically, it mentions that the autofocus is struggling to lock onto the subject, causing blur. The text explicitly states: ""Nkongomiso wo olova lowu endlaka ku cinca u ri karhi u endla leswaku ku va ni ku tshamiseka eka xifaniso."" which translates to ""The algorithm that causes it to change often makes it so that there is blur in the image.""

Therefore, the goal of fixing the problem is to *prevent blur* which is achieved by ensuring the autofocus *locks onto the subject*. Options A, B, and C describe steps related to camera settings or composition, but they don't directly address the underlying problem of the autofocus system failing to properly lock focus and causing blur. Option D directly addresses the problem described in the text.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki muxaka wa ku teka xifaniso wa 35mm?,"The correct answer is **B: Yi hundziseriwe eka mixaka ya khamera ya digitali.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""kambe swa nkoka ngopfu i xiringaniso xa xiyenge lexi nga hundziseriwa eka mixaka ya switwi swa xifaniso xa khamera ya digitali."" (but it is especially important that the aspect ratio be transferred to the aspect ratio of digital camera image formats). This directly answers the question of what makes the 35mm format relevant today.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ya ha endliwa ni namuntlha** (It is not made anymore) - The passage says it *is* used with digital cameras.
*   **C: Yi na xiringaniso xa xiyenge lexi hambaneke ni tinxaka tin’wana leti tolovelekeke** (It has an aspect ratio that is different and has other common formats)- While true, the core point is its *transferability* to digital cameras.
*   **D: I muxaka lowu tolovelekeke ngopfu emisaveni** (It is a very common format in film) - While 35mm was very common in film, the question asks what makes it *relevant today* which the passage focuses on its transferability to digital.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, loko vaendli va engetela swiyimo swa ku endla tilense, tilense ta ku tshineta ti antswisiwe njhani?","The correct answer is **A: Ti na rivilo lerikulu ra tilense**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xiphiqo xa tilense ta ku tshineta swilo i mpimo lowukulu wa vukulu bya ximbhovana (i rivilo) xa lense byi le hansi."" This translates to ""A major characteristic of progressive lenses is the thick bottom edge (the bevel) of the lens.""

Option A directly reflects this key characteristic. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided in the passage.
"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga eka ndzimana, swi nga endleka rini laha lense ya ku tshineta yi nga laviwaka ku tlula lense ya ku leha ka langutelo leri simekiweke?","The correct answer is **A: Loko xikongomelo-nkulu ku ri mpimo lowukulu wa vukulu bya ximbhovana**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xiphiqo xa tilense ta ku tshineta swilo i mpimo lowukulu wa vukulu bya ximbhovana (i rivilo) xa lense byi le hansi."" (The primary advantage of graduated lenses is the large diameter of the lens elements (the prism) at the bottom.)

This indicates that the large prism shape is the *key* reason graduated lenses are preferred over standard achromatic lenses.  Therefore, the choice that directly addresses the reason for this preference is option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko u lava nhlayo leyitsongo ya swiaki swa lense:** While graduated lenses *can* provide better color correction, the text doesn't explicitly state this as the *primary* reason for their use.
* **C: Loko u nga lavi ku tirhisa rivoni ra miseve eka swiyimo laha ku nga munyama:**  The text mentions the potential for chromatic aberration with graduated lenses, but doesn't link it to a preference for avoiding the ""rainbow"" effect. In fact, graduated lenses are used *to reduce* the rainbow effect in some situations.
* **D: Loko u lava ku rharhangana ka langutelo loku engetelekeke:** The text focuses on the advantages of the prism shape, not the complexity of the optical design.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki nhlamuselo yo kongoma ya Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku kandziyisa ka yona ku twa ku rhula ni xiyimo xa ku titwa xo hlawuleka.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu yi nga hambanisiwa ni mixaka yin’wana ya tidyondzo ta vukhongeri ni ku gandzela hi ku kandziyisa ka yona ntokoto wo kongoma wa munhu hi yexe wa xiyimo xa ku titwa xo hlawuleka...""  This directly links the practice to feelings of calmness and a sense of security.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Valandzeri va Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu va lava vuxiyaxiya bya munhu la heleleke bya ntiyiso ya moya:** While spiritual understanding might be a result, it's not the primary focus of the practice itself as described in the text.
* **C: Valandzeri va Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu va amukela mikhuva leyi pfunaka ku kurisa vutlharhi a ntiyisweni wa vukwembu:**  The text mentions using rituals to foster understanding of the divine, but doesn't say followers *accept* specific rituals for this purpose.
* **D: Ku kandziyisiwa ku lava ntokoto wo kongoma ku fana ni tidyondzo tin’wana ta vukhongeri ni ku gandzela:**  While there *is* a similarity, the text highlights the specific connection between the practice and feelings of calmness and security, making option A a more direct and accurate answer.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga riki eka Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu?","The correct answer is **B: Ku fikelela vutivi hi mintokoto leyi nga averiwa, ni leyi humelelaka eka van’wana.**

Here's why:

The text states that the practice of seeking communion with God (Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu) involves a seeker needing a tool for healing, strength, and clarity to understand divine truth.  Furthermore, followers need ways to access this communion.  The text then connects this practice to the need for healing, peace, clarity, and emotional upliftment.

Option B directly aligns with this.  It says that seeking communion involves achieving healing through observable and shared rituals. This resonates with the need for tools and ways to access the divine mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ku lava vutivi eka vutlharhi a ntiyisweni wa vukwembu:** While clarity is needed, the text implies more than just seeking clarity; it emphasizes *achieving* healing *through* rituals.
* **C: Ku kandziyisa ka xiyimo xa ku titwa xo hlawuleka:**  Self-esteem is a *result* of a successful communion, not the process itself.
* **D: Ku fikelela vuxiyaxiya bya Xikwembu:**  While accessing divine truth is a goal, the text emphasizes the methods and rituals used to reach that truth, rather than just the truth itself.



Therefore, option B best encapsulates what follows the initial description of the Dyondzo ya ku va swin’we ni Xikwembu.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i va mani lava swi nga endlekaka leswaku va sungule rixaka ro rima?","The correct answer is **A: Vamaori va le New Zealand**.

The passage states: ""A ku tshembiwa leswaku vanhu vo sungula ku tshama eNew Zealand a va ri Vamaori..."" (It is believed that the people who first settled in New Zealand were the Maori...).
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, vanhu lava hloteke swinyenyana leswi vuriwaka moas a ku ri vanhu vo sungula endhawini yihi?","The correct answer is **D: E Polynesia**.

The passage states: ""Mavonelo lama ya kombise leswaku vanhu Vamaori va suke ePolynesia eGreat Fleet va nghena eNew Zealand..."" (Evidence suggests that the Māori people came to New Zealand from Polynesia in the Great Fleet...)

Hi le ka swiyimo swihi laha ku tirhisiwa ka ndlela ya Pureland origami swi nga ta pfuna mupetsi?,"The correct answer is **B: Mupetsi u ni vuswikoti lebyi hluvukeke bya misiha.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Pureland origami was created by John Smith in the 1970s to find ""dedicated folders or those with a passion for fine detail and intricate designs.""  Option B directly reflects this by mentioning a passion for fine detail and intricate designs (which is implied by ""vuswikoti lebyi hluvukeke bya misiha"" - passion for intricate details).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Mupetsi u rhandza kupetsa loku rharhangeneke ngopfu hi nkarhi wun’we (The folder loves to fold very intricately in a short time).** While intricate folding is involved, the focus isn't solely on speed. The passage mentions dedication and passion, not just speed.
* **C: Mupetsi u endla origami leyi lavaka kupetsa loku rharhangeneke ngopfu (The folder makes origami that loves to fold very intricately).** This is backwards. The *folder* is the one who enjoys intricate folding, not the origami itself.
* **D: Mupetsi u tshama a ringeta kan’we kumbe kambirhi (The folder goes out once or twice).** This has nothing to do with the purpose of Pureland origami. The passage focuses on the skill and passion of the folders.



"
I yin eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma Pureland origami?,"The correct answer is **A: Yi endleriwe vapetsi lava nga ni ntokoto**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yi sunguriwe hi John Smith hi va-1970 ku pfuna vapetsi vo kala ntokoto kumbe va vuswikoti bya misiha le byitsongo.""  This translates to: ""It was founded by John Smith in the 1970s to find artists with a strong spirit or with a passion for silk and wool."" 

Therefore, the key element in the creation of Pureland Origami was the search for artists *with a strong spirit (ntokoto)*.  The other options are either consequences of the origami's existence (C) or descriptions of the origami itself (B, D), but not the reason for its creation.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i ndhawu yihi leyi nga fambisaniki ni Muganga wa Indus Valley?","The correct answer is **A: Le Harappa**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that **Le Harappa** is the site where the Indus Valley Civilization was first discovered.  It also mentions that the river was later called the Harappan River.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nambu wa Sarasvati:** While there's a debate about whether the Indus River and the Sarasvati River were the same, the passage mentions them in relation to the Indus Valley Civilization, but not as a primary location *associated* with the civilization.
* **C: Tindhawu hinkwato ta le n’walungu-vuxa Afghanistan:** Afghanistan is mentioned as a region the Indus Valley Civilization influenced, but not as a location directly *associated* with the river itself.
* **D: Vunyingi bya Pakistan ya namuntlha:** The Indus River flows through a large part of modern-day Pakistan, and the civilization was centered there.  However, this is a *region*, not a specific location *associated* with the river's origin or the civilization's beginnings.

Therefore, Le Harappa is the most directly and specifically linked location to the Indus Valley Civilization.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga si vuriwa tanihi vito ra Nguva ya Koporo lowu ku nga vuriwa ha wona eka ndzimana?,"The correct answer is **A: Muganga wa le Harappan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Indus Valley River is also known as the Harappan River, derived from the location of Harappa. The question asks which of the options is *not* mentioned as a name for the river.  The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **Muganga wa Indus Valley** (the primary name)
*   **Muganga wa Nambu wa Indus** (its source)
*   **Muganga wa Indus-Sarasvati** (a proposed name linking it to the Sarasvati River)
*   **Muganga wa le Harappan** (as an alternative name due to Harappa being its location)

Therefore, ""Muganga wa le Harappan"" is a name the passage *does* mention, and the question asks for a name that is *not* mentioned.

The options provided:

*   **A: Muganga wa le Harappan** - Mentioned.
*   **B: Muganga wa Indus-Sarasvati** - Mentioned.
*   **C: Muganga wa Nambu wa Indus** - Mentioned.
*   **D: Muganga wa Indus Valley** - Mentioned.

There seems to be an error in the question or the options provided as all options are mentioned in the passage. However, if forced to pick the closest incorrect answer, it would be option A, as ""Muganga wa le Harappan"" is a valid alternative name mentioned in the passage.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tisaka swilo leswinene hi nkarhi wo leha?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tirhisana ni van’wana (Working with others)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how a lack of communication leads to problems and how experienced people should understand the importance of collaboration to resolve issues effectively. Option A directly reflects this idea of working with others to find solutions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku rhangisa swilaveko swa munhu hi yexe ku sungula (Preparing people's events in advance to start)** - This doesn't directly relate to resolving issues caused by a lack of communication.
*   **C: Ku kandziyisa leswi nga ta pfuna ntlawa lowutsongo ku tlula ntlawa lowukulu (Prioritizing what needs a younger leader over an older one)** - This is completely irrelevant to the topic of communication and problem-solving.
*   **D: Ku lemuka leswaku makwanga ma nga vuyerisa (Realizing that mistakes can be forgiving)** - While forgiveness might be helpful in some situations, it doesn't address the core issue of *how* to solve problems caused by communication breakdowns.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that logically follows from the passage's central theme."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi munhu a nga ta swi rhangisa loko va dzike eka ku vuyeriwa hi ku hatlisa?","The best answer is **A: Ku pfumala vutianakanyi (Increased frustration)**.

Here's why:

* **The question describes a situation where people are rushed during a process (likely a medical one based on the context of ""vutianakanyi swi ti ta tshama swi ri kona naswona hi ntumbuluko ya ma bindzu"").**  Being rushed often leads to feelings of frustration.
* **Option A directly addresses the emotional response to being rushed.**
* **The other options are less directly related:**
    * **B: Ntirhisano (Collaboration)** -  Being rushed is unlikely to foster collaboration.
    * **C: Ku khomisana (Misunderstanding)** - While rushing *can* lead to misunderstandings, increased frustration is the more immediate and direct consequence.
    * **D: Vutianakanyi (Frustration)** -  While frustration *is* a result, ""increased frustration"" better captures the *process* of what happens when someone is rushed.



Therefore, **Ku pfumala vutianakanyi** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga hakelela xiphemo lexikulu xa swikoxo swa nyimpi?","The correct answer is **C: Mfumo wa koloni ya U.S.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mali yo tlula mpimo leyi a yi kumeka hi ku dyelela ka nkarhi wo leha vanhu va le Philippines a ku ta endla mbuyelo wa xisekelo wa mfumo wa U.S.""  This translates to ""Excess money that was accumulated through the exploitation of the people of the Philippines to restore the original system of the U.S. colonial regime.""

This directly links the excessive money to the *colonial regime* of the U.S., implying it was the U.S. colonial government that benefited from this exploitation. The passage indicates the money was used to restore the U.S. colonial system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mfumo wa Philippines:** While the people of the Philippines were exploited, the colonial system *benefited* from the exploitation, it wasn't the system itself that ""hacked"" the financial system.
*   **B: Tibangi ta le Wall Street:** While Wall Street was involved in financial markets, the passage doesn't directly connect the excessive money to Wall Street. The link is specifically to the U.S. colonial regime.
*   **D: Vanhu va le Philippines:** The people of the Philippines were exploited, but they were the ones who *suffered* the consequences of the exploitation, not the ones who ""hacked"" the financial system. They were the victims.



Therefore, the U.S. colonial regime is the most logical answer."
I nkarhi wihi lowu nga fika ku nga si va nkarhi wa Titemplar?,"The correct answer is **D: Malembe-xidzana ya vu 13**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nkarhi lowu swiendlakalo leswi nga humelela hi wona hi ntolovelo u vuriwa Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le Henhla nkarhi wa matimu ya Yuropa hi malembe-xidzana ya vu-11,12 ni vu-13 (AD 1000–1300).""  This directly links the Templar period to the years 1100-1300 AD, which includes the year 1300.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya Makumo:** The text says the Medieval period *followed* the High Middle Ages, not that the Templar period was part of it.
*   **B: Malembe-xidzana ya vu 12:** While 1100-1300 includes the year 1200, 1300 is a more definitive end point for the Templar period as indicated in the text.
*   **C: Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le ku Sunguleni:** The text explicitly states that the Early Middle Ages came *before* the High Middle Ages."
I nkarhi wihi lowu nga fika endzhaku ka nkarhi wa Titemplar?,"The correct answer is **A: Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya Makumo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le u Sunguleni a te emahlweni ka Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya le Henhla kambe ku landzela Malembe ya le Xikarhi ya Makumo..."" (The Early Middle Ages appeared after the High Middle Ages, but was followed by the Late Middle Ages...).  Therefore, the Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages.

I vutshunguri kumbe maendlelo mahi lama nga si vuriwa tanihi lama nga tirhisiwa hi madokodela ni madokodela ya vuhandzuri hi nkarhi wa mfumo wa Roma?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tshungula vuvabyi bya ntshikelo ya mianakanyo endzhaku ka mhangu hi swidzidzirisi swo hambana-hambana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Madokodela ma sungule ku rhambiwa hi Mufumi Augustus kambe a endla Vuthu ra le Roma ra Vutshunguri ro sungula leswaku ri pfuna endzaku ka le swi nga humelela enyimpini.""  It also mentions that doctors used ""swidzidzirisi swo hambana-hambana ku hlanganisa ni morphine leyi humaka a mbewini ya swimilana swa poppy ni scopolamine leyi humaka a mbewini ya herbane.""  These were all used to induce anesthesia, implying they were used to numb patients *before* surgery. While options B, C, and D describe *how* they achieved anesthesia, option A describes the *purpose* of using these substances - to induce a state of numbness before surgery. The passage emphasizes the desire for increased surgical capability, which directly links to inducing a painless state.



Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ku tirhisa leswi humaka a mbewini ya herbane eka scopolamine:** This describes *what* substances were used, not the overall process. It's a component of the anesthesia, not the broader practice.
*   **C: Ku hunguta ku khuluka ka ngati hi ku rhunga misiha-nkulu:** This is one *method* of inducing anesthesia, but not the entirety of the practice.
*   **D: Ku endla vutshila byo tsema swirho leswaku va ponisa vavabyi ka swilondza leswi pfundzelaka:** This is how they achieved anesthesia, not the broader practice.



Therefore, option A is the most encompassing and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nga swi vuriwa leswaku swi vangele nhluvuko eka swa vutshunguri hi nkarhi wa Mfumo wa Roma?","The correct answer is **A: Ku vumbiwa ka Rhavi ra swa Vutshunguri (The Adoption of a Cannabis Ritual)**.

The text explicitly states: ""...the Roman state adopted a cannabis ritual, which they believed would help them in future wars.""  This is the primary reason for the increased use of cannabis during the Roman Empire.  The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
Ku kota ku vona ku titshege eka yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Swirho swa ku vona (Visual elements)**.

Here's why:

The first sentence states: ""Swivono, kumbe ku kota ku vona ku titshege eka swirho swa ku vona kumbe matihlo."" This translates to: ""Visuals, it is possible to see details in visual elements or patterns.""

Therefore, the question ""Ku kota ku vona ku titshege eka yini?"" (What can you see details in?) is answered by ""Swirho swa ku vona"" (visual elements).

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Leswi laviwaka hi xivumbiwa (What is favored by the audience):** While the text mentions audience preferences, it's not what you see details *in*.
*   **C: Ku tikelwa hi tindlela leti hambaneke (How they are created):** This refers to the process of creation, not what the details are *in*.
*   **D: Ku nga voni hi ndlela leyi yi fanaka (Not seen in a similar way):** This describes a difference in perception, not what you see details *in*.



"
Tindlela leti hambaneke leti matihlo ma endliweke ha kona eka swivumbiwa swi titshege eka yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Swilaveko swa xivumbiwa (Visual perception)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how different visual features (like movement, color, and shape) are processed in the brain. It mentions how these features are organized and interpreted, and how different brain areas specialize in processing different aspects of vision.  This directly relates to **visual perception**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tikeriwa (Processing):** While processing is involved, the passage is more specific about *what* is being processed – visual features and how they relate to perception.
* **C: Mpimo wa ku vona (The sense of sight):** This is too broad. The passage delves into the *mechanisms* of visual processing, not just the sense of sight itself.
* **D: Ku rharhangana ka xivumbiwa (Integration of stimuli):**  Integration is part of perception, but the passage focuses more on the specific features being processed and how they contribute to the overall visual experience.



Therefore, **Swilaveko swa xivumbiwa (Visual perception)** is the most accurate answer."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi mayelana ni Vusikh leswi nga kombisiki hi ku kongoma vukhongeri?","The correct answer is **A: Vusikh i vuyelo ra ku suka a ku hambaneni ka ntlawa eka ndhavuko wa Mahindu.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Byi sungule a xifundzeni xa le Punjab hi lembe-xidzana ra vu-15 ku suka a ku hambaneni ka ntlawa eka ndhavuko wa Mahindu."" This translates to ""It began in the Punjab region in the 15th century as a departure from the traditions of Hinduism.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Guru i xiphemu xa nkoka xa vukhongeri bya Vusikh:** While true, this is mentioned in the passage, but option A is a more fundamental and overarching aspect of Sikhism.
* **C: Ku tlheli ku landzela hi ku tlhandlamana ti guru tin’wana ta kaye endzhaku ka musunguli wa vukhongeri, Guru Nanak:** This is also true, but option A describes the *origin* of Sikhism.
* **D: Mindhavuko yin’wana ya Vusikh i mikhuva ya Vuhindu:** The passage states the opposite – that Sikhism is a departure from Hinduism.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tekiwaka tanihi xiphemu-nkulu xa vukhongeri bya Vusikh?","The correct answer is **C: Ku ala ku amukela vukhongeri byin’wan bya Indiya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Guru i xiphemu xa nkoka xa vukhongeri hinkwabyo bya le Indiya kambe eka Vusikh u teke ku va ka nkoka loku endlaka xisekelo va tidyondzo ta Masikh.""  This translates to: ""The Guru is the most important religious figure in India, but in Sikhism, he became the foundation of Sikh study."" This implies that Sikhism *adopted* elements of Indian religious thought, particularly the Guru concept, while also developing its own unique identity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dyondzo ya guru (Study of the Guru):** While studying the Guru is important, it's not the *next* step in the development of Sikh religious thought. It's more of a consequence of the Guru's influence.
*   **B: Mindhavuko ya Vuhindu (Hindu Traditions):**  While Sikhism initially existed within the context of Hinduism, the passage indicates it wasn't simply a continuation of Hindu traditions but a distinct religious development.
*   **D: Ku vulavula ririmi ra le Punjab (The Development of the Punjabi Language):** While the Punjabi language is important to Sikhism, the passage doesn't link its development directly to the next step in Sikh religious thought.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, vana lava nga ni Attention Deficit Disorder va tikeriwa ku dzikisa mianakanyo eka swilo swa ku fana ni?","The correct answer is **A: Ntirho wa xikolo (School activities)**.

This directly links their difficulty with screen time to emotional dysregulation (nyanyula byongo).



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku hunguta ku va ni matimba ngopfu:** The text says they have *difficulty* focusing, not *excess* energy.
*   **B: Ku va pfuna ku endla vuxaka ni tintangha ta vona:** While people with ADD might be talkative, the text focuses on the *difficulty focusing* as the reason for screen-time issues.
*   **C: Ku kuma nyingiso eka vatswari va vona:** The text doesn't mention their parents providing understanding or support. It highlights the difficulties they face due to their ADD.

"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga eka ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xikombiso xa ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo?","The correct answer is **A: Dyondzo eku sunguleni ka ntlangu wa khompyuta (Computer-assisted language learning)**.

Here's why:

The text describes ""Dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo"" (Computer-assisted language learning) as using computers or software to automate the feedback process in language learning. This involves inputting data, analyzing it, and providing feedback on potential errors.

Option A, ""Dyondzo eku sunguleni ka ntlangu wa khompyuta,"" directly translates to ""Computer-assisted language learning"" and aligns perfectly with the definition provided in the text.

The other options are not related to the concept of computer-assisted language learning:

*   **B: Mudyondzisi wa SAT (SAT Tester)** is a standardized test, not a language learning tool.
*   **C: Progreme ya ku tiyimela ya ku dyondza (Study automation program)** is too general. While it might involve automation, it doesn't specifically address the feedback process in language learning.
*   **D: Muleteri wa nhlangano lowutsongo (Letter from an organization)** is irrelevant.

Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately reflects the meaning of ""Dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo"" as described in the text.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma dyondzo ya ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo?,"The correct answer is **B: I mpfuno ku tlula ndlela ya ku dyondza.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo a hi yona ndlela ya ku dyondza kambe i mpfuno lowu nyikaka nseketelo eka vanhu lava nga eka ntokoto lowuntshwa wa ku dyondzisa ku fana ni ku tirhisa progreme ya khompyuta leyintshwa kumbe ku sungula ntirho lowuntshwa.""

This directly translates to: ""Fast feedback is the way to study, but the feedback that bothers you is the feedback that is given to the new generation of students, similar to using new computer programs or starting a new process.""

This means that while fast feedback is a *method* of studying, the *problem* is the feedback itself (it can be overwhelming or bothersome).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo ku nga endilwa hi khompyuta:** While the text mentions computers, it's not the core issue. The problem isn't *how* the feedback is delivered, but *what* the feedback *is*.
* **C: Ku tiviwa tanihi ku dyondza loku nga seketeriwa eku endleni ntirho:** The text describes fast feedback as a way of studying, not something that is prevented.
* **D: Ku dyondza ku ri karhi ku nyiketeriwa nseketelo ku tirhisiwa ku nyika nseketelo eka ntokoto lowuntshwa wa ku dyondzisa:** This is partially true, but the text focuses on the negative impact of the feedback, not just its use. It's not simply *giving* feedback, but the feedback itself being problematic.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swihlawulekisi swihi swa MySpace leswi nga ta pfuna swichudeni leswi tikeriwaka ku hlaya?","The correct answer is **A: Ku cinciwa ku endla swi olova**.

The text states: ""Ti nga cinciwa ku endla swi olova ku hlaya ni hi ku va ni muvala wo tala kumbe lowutsongo hilaha munhu a lavaka hakona."" This directly translates to ""It can be changed to make the interface cleaner and to have a light or dark color that the person likes.""  This describes the ability to customize the layout and appearance of the MySpace profile.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tibulogo (Blogs):**  While blogs were a feature of MySpace, the text doesn't link blogs to the ability to customize the interface.
* **C: Adirese ya webusayiti yin’we (Another website address):** The text mentions using a website address to cause issues, but not to customize the interface.
* **D: Tiphurofayili ta 54 wa timiliyoni (54 million profiles):** This is just a statistic about the number of MySpace profiles and doesn't relate to interface customization.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xiphemu xa nhlamulo ya Krushchev eka mpfilumpfulu wa vatirhi?","The correct answer is **A: Veka holobye-nkulu lontshwa**.

Here's why:

The question asks what happened *later* in Khrushchev's rule regarding the workers' movement. The passage states that after initially sending troops to stabilize the situation, and experiencing some economic improvements, Khrushchev **placed Wladyslaw Gomulka, a popular figure, as the leader**.  This is a key event that reflects a shift in Khrushchev's approach to the Polish workers' movement. Options B, C, and D describe actions taken *earlier* in the timeline described.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xivangelo xa mpfilumpfulu a Poland?,"The correct answer is **A: Vukhomunisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the initial situation in Poland in June 1956 involved struggles related to food shortages, repression, and a fight against Communism. While the other options (food shortages, repression, and the rise of Gomulka) were *part* of the situation, the overarching factor that defined the political climate and drove the events was **Communism**. The events were a direct challenge *to* the Communist system.  The attempted reforms under Krushchev ultimately failed to fundamentally alter the Communist structure, though they did lead to a temporary shift in leadership.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga khumbaka vuxaka exikarhi ka USSR na USA?","The correct answer is **C: Maendlelo lama hambaneke (Different Developments)**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes the Cold War as a period of conflict through proxy wars, political developments, and technological advancements. It highlights that the conflict spanned many regions and lasted for decades.  The question asks what *followed* and what *remains* as a result of the Cold War.  The core outcome is a legacy of *different developments* – different political systems, economic structures, technological trajectories, and international relationships across the globe, all stemming from the competition between the USSR and the USA.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ku hambana ka mindhavuko (Different traditions):** While cultural differences played a role, the Cold War was primarily a political and ideological struggle.  It's not the core result.
* **B: Mavonelo hi Jarimani (Lessons from Germany):**  The text mentions WWII in relation to the Cold War, but the *lessons* from Germany aren't the defining outcome.
* **D: Timholovo mayelana ni mafambiselo (Disagreements about travel):** Travel restrictions were *part* of the Cold War, but not the overall legacy or what *followed*.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma xikongomelo xa ku rhumela rungula hi tinevhe eka miri hinkwawo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku lawula fambiselo ra ngati**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fambiselo ra Tinevhe ri hlayisa homostasisi hi ku rhumela rungula hi tinevhe eka mirhhi hinkwawo leswaku ku va ni fambiselo ra ngati naswona ri nga kavanyetiwi."" (The Tinevhe system maintains homeostasis by releasing hormones into the bloodstream because there is a continuous system that cannot be interrupted.)
* **The question asks:** ""I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma xikongomelo xa ku rhumela rungula hi tinevhe eka miri hinkwawo?"" (What happens that is not regulated by the hormone release system into the bloodstream?)
* **The answer:** The passage implies that interrupting the hormone release system would lead to a disruption of the continuous, regulated system. Therefore, the system's ability to *control* this continuous flow (fambiselo ra ngati) would be compromised.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hunguta fambiselo ra ngati** (Disrupting the continuous system) - While a consequence, the primary effect isn't *disrupting* the system, but rather the inability to *control* it.
* **C: Ku hlayisa homostasisi** (Maintaining homeostasis) - The question asks what *doesn't* happen when the system is interrupted. Therefore, homeostasis wouldn't be maintained.
* **D: Ku papalata ku chava kun’wana ni kun’wana** (Causing widespread dehydration) - The passage mentions hormone release *helps* maintain hydration by encouraging water uptake, not that dehydration is a result of system interruption.



"
I yini leswi nga kumiwaka eka Timbala-ntshava ta Giza?,"The correct answer is **D: Xihondzo Lexikulu**.

The text explicitly states: ""Timbala-ntshava ta Giza, kumbe “Giza Necropolis” a Nkoveni wa la va Feke wa le Egipta ti na swihondzo swo hlayanyana (leswi e ka swona xihondzo lexikulu ku nga xona lexikulu)..."" which translates to ""The Giza Necropolis... has elaborate tombs (which could include a royal tomb)..."".  The text then goes on to say the Great Pyramid was built to house Pharaoh Khufu.
"
A ku ri yini xikongomelo xa Xihondzo Lexikulu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku dzunisa Faro**.

The text explicitly states: ""Xihondzo lexikulu xi endleriwe ku dzunisa Faro Khufu..."" (The pyramid complex was built to bury Pharaoh Khufu...).
"
I mani la nga ni vutihlamuleri hi vutivi bya hina bya mutshiveri wa ndzilo loyi a nga lovisa tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Vanhu va le Efesa**.

The passage states: ""Vanhu va le Efesa, va hlundzukile, va tivise leswaku vito ra Herostratus ri nga rhekhodiwi."" (The people of Ephesus, enraged, decided that Herostratus' name should not be recorded.) This indicates that the people of Ephesus were the ones who reacted with outrage and decided against recording his name.
"
I swiga swihi leswi nga kongoma mayelana ni ku pfuxetiwa ka Tempele ya Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku pfuxetiwe endzhaku ka ku fuma ka Alekzanda Lonkulu**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Tempele yi lovisiwe hi vusiku vun’we lebyi Alekzanda Lonkulu a nga velekiwa hi byona. Alekzanda, tanihi hosi, u te u ta hakelela ku pfuxeta tempele, kambe a nga pfumeleriwanga. Endzhaku ka nkarhi, endzhaku ka loko a lovile, tempele yi pfuxetiwile hi 323 BCE.""  This directly translates to ""The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great died. Alexander, as king, wanted to rebuild the temple, but was not allowed. Later, after he died, the temple was destroyed in 323 BCE.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku pfuxetiwa ku hakeleriwe hi Alekzanda Lonkulu:** While Alexander *wanted* to rebuild, he didn't actually destroy it.
* **C: Herostratus u lerisiwe ku hakelela ku pfuxetiwa:** The text says Herostratus was *accused* of causing the destruction, not that he was condemned to do so.
* **D: Ku pfuxetiwe hi 320 BCE:** The text explicitly says it happened in 323 BCE.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, a ku ri rini ro sungula loko swivumbiwa swi famba hi milenge yimbirhi?","The correct answer is **D: Timiliyoni ta 4.2 wa malembe lama hundzeke**.

The passage states: ""Vufambi byo tirhisa milenge yimbirhi byi kumeka eka vuyimburi bya Australopithecus ku suka hi 4.2-3.9 wa timiliyoni ta malembe lama hundzeke..."" This means bipedalism first appeared in Australopithecus around 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago.
"
I swivumbiwa swihi eka leswi swa ku famba hi milenge yimbirhi nkarhi ni nkarhi?,"The correct answer is **D: Australopithecus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vufambi byo tirhisa milenge yimbirhi byi kumeka eka vuyimburi bya Australopithecus ku suka hi 4.2-3.9 wa timiliyoni ta malembe lama hundzeke..."" (Bipedalism first appeared in the lineage of Australopithecus starting 4.2-3.9 million years ago...).

While Sahelanthropus is mentioned as a potential early bipedal species, the passage specifically links the emergence of bipedalism to *Australopithecus*. Homo Erectus is mentioned later in the passage as a species that evolved from earlier bipedal forms.
"
Masocha ya le Jarimani ya le matini a ma ringeta ku fikelela yini hi Nyimpi ya Vumbirhi ya Msava?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku sivela Britain ku amukela vanhu ni nhundzu**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maamerika a va ringeta ku susa vavanuna ni switirho ku tsemakanya Lwandle-nkulu ra Atlantiki leswaku va pfuna Britain. Loko ku hlengerisa a swi nga tirhangi, Jarimani a yi swi kotile ku hlula Britain tanihi leswi yi hluleke Yuropa.""

This means Germany's goal was to invade Britain. Option B accurately reflects that goal – invading Britain to take control of its people and territory. The other options are incorrect based on the passage.
"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga humelela ngopfu eka nyimpi ya vuthu ra le matini hi nkarhi wa Tsima ra Atlantiki N’walungu?","The correct answer is **C: Majarimani ni va le Britain**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Maamerika a va ringeta ku susa vavanuna ni switirho ku tsemakanya Lwandle-nkulu ra Atlantiki leswaku va pfuna Britain. Loko ku hlengerisa a swi nga tirhangi, Jarimani a yi tava yi swi kotile ku hlula Britain tanihi leswi yi hluleke Yuropa.""
* **This means:** Both the Americans (representing the United States) and the Germans were heavily involved in the Atlantic War during the Battle of the Atlantic, with Germany aiming to defeat Britain.



"
I yini leswi nga swi va kona loko Vaasiriya va sungula ku tirhisa vagadi va tihanci?,"The correct answer is **A: Switshamo leswi tlhandlekiwaka ehancini (Siege warfare)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kwalomu ka 1000 B.C., Vaasiriya va sungule ku lwa hi vagadi va tihanci vo sungula. Vagadi va tihanci i vuthu leri lwaka ri khandziye tihanci. **Switshamo leswi tlhandlekiwaka ehancini a swi nga si tirhisiwa...**""

This directly links the introduction of siege warfare (using battering rams) to the obsolescence of previous siege tactics.  The text implies that the battering rams rendered older methods ineffective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mavurha (Gates):** While gates were targets, the core issue wasn't *gates* themselves, but the tactics used to breach fortifications.
*   **C: Makalichi (Battering rams):**  Battering rams were the *tool* used in siege warfare, not the *reason* for adopting it.
*   **D: Mahavelo (Fortresses):** Fortresses were the targets, but the question is about *why* the Assyrians started using battering rams, not the fortresses themselves.



"
Tinyimpi leti tirhisaka vagadi va tihanci ti lwiwa njhani?,"The correct answer is **C: Va tshame ehenhla ka nhlana wa hanci**.

The passage states: ""Switshamo leswi tlhandlekiwaka ehancini a swi nga si tirhisiwa, hikwalaho vagadi va tihanci va va Asiriya a va lwa va tshame ehenhla ka nhlana wa hanci u nga ri na nchumu."" This translates to: ""The attacks that were defeated in warfare could not be used, because the Assyrian archers fought from atop a platform of reeds that had no support.""

Therefore, the Assyrian archers fought from atop a platform of reeds.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, hi le kwihi laha u nge kumiki muaka-tiko la tolovelekeke wa Babilona?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tisa magandzelo eka xivava xa tempele**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vababilona va akele un’wana ni un’wana wa swikwembu swa vona tempele leyikulu leyi a yi tekiwa tanihi kaya ra xikwembu. **Vanhu a va tisa magandzelo eka swikwembu** naswona..."" (Babylonians built one of their temples, which was considered the dwelling place of their god. **People offered sacrifices to the god**...).

Option A directly reflects this statement. The other options describe activities *within* the temple, but the passage begins by describing the act of offering sacrifices *to* the temple.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi a ku ri swa vaprista ntsena?,"The correct answer is **C: Mihivahivani**.

The text states: ""Vanhu a va tisa magandzelo eka swikwembu naswona vaprista a va ringeta ku khathalela swilaveko swa swikwembu hi ku endla mihivahivani...""  This directly translates to: ""People used to give offerings to the gods and the priests took care of the gods' affairs by performing sacrifices...""

Therefore, the priests performed **sacrifices (mihivahivani)**.
"
Xana Hosi Tutankhamun u ve ni ndhuma rini?,"The correct answer is **C: Endzhaku ka ku kumiwa ka sirha ra yena**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hambiloko va teke swilo emasirheni yo tala ya khale, sirha leri ri tshikiwi ri nga kavanyetiwanga."" This means the discovery of his tomb led to the recognition and fame of Tutankhamun. Therefore, his death is referenced *after* the discovery of the tomb.
"
I yini leswi nga endla Hosi Tutankhamun a va hosi ya Egipta leyi tiviwaka swinene?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku kumiwa ka sirha ra yena leri ri nga tshikiwa ri nga kavanyetiwanga.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Hambiswiritano, ku kumiwa ka sirha ra yena hi 1992 ku n’wi endle munhu loyi a dumeke."" (Furthermore, the discovery of his tomb in 1992 made him famous.)
* While the other options are true about Tutankhamun, the discovery of his largely intact tomb is the *primary* reason for his widespread fame. The intact tomb provided unprecedented insight into the burial practices and treasures of Egyptian pharaohs.

Therefore, option A directly addresses the main reason for his fame as stated in the passage."
I yini leswi mutlhokovetseri Homer wa Mugriki a tsandzeka ku swi endla?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku twa**.

The passage states that Homer ""was a figure who was greatly revered."" This implies he was looked up to and admired, which is best described as ""ku twa"" (to look up to/revere). The other options don't fit the context:

* **Ku vona (to see):**  Doesn't relate to reverence.
* **Ku famba (to travel):**  Not relevant to Homer's status.
* **Ku vulavula (to speak):** While Homer composed epics, the passage focuses on his revered status, not his speaking abilities.



"
Hi wihi Mugriki loyi a nga ni ndhuma ya swin'wana handle ka vutsari?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

The passage states: ""Mugriki un’wana loyi a dumeke i mutivi wa tinhlayo Pythagoras, loyi a tiviwaka ngopfu hi nhlamuselo ya yena leyi dumeke ya kutirhisana ka matlhelo ya swivunguvungu swa tinhla tinharhu ta engele ya 90 wa tidigri."" This translates to: ""One Greek who is celebrated is the mathematician Pythagoras, who is greatly admired for his famous doctrine which uses the numbers of triangles with angles of 90 degrees.""

While the question asks about a playwright, Pythagoras is the only one listed whose fame is explicitly tied to a specific, widely recognized intellectual achievement described in the passage.  Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes are all playwrights mentioned as influential, but the passage doesn't highlight a single, defining reason for their widespread renown in the same way it does for Pythagoras.
"
Ndyangu wa Vaheveru a wu tirhisa nkarhi wa wona hi xitalo kwihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Exitarateni**.

The passage states: ""Vutomi bya ndyangu wa Vaheveru hi xitalo a wu ri ehandle. Vavasati a va sweka ejarateni; switolo a ku ri tikhawuntara leti nga erivaleni ti langute exitarateni."" This translates to: ""The life of the Hebrews was spent in the fields. Women were sweeping in the courtyard; animals were found in the storeroom.""

Therefore, the Hebrews spent their time **in the fields** (ehandle) and **in the courtyard** (exitarateni). However, the question asks *where* they spent their time in general, and the passage highlights the fields as a major part of their life. The courtyard is mentioned as a specific place for women's activities.  Since ""exitarateni"" (in the courtyard) is an option and a place where significant activity happened (women sweeping), it is a valid answer. However, the statement about the life being spent *in the fields* is the most encompassing and accurate.

Considering the options, **B: Exitarateni** is the best fit as a place where they spent a significant portion of their time, though the fields were perhaps more central to their livelihood.
"
I yini leswi a swi nga ri swa nkoka eka ndyangu wa Vaheveru?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaya ra vona (Their homes)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ehansi ka maxelo yo hisa ya le Vuxa Xikarhi, yindlu a yi nga ri ya nkoka."" which translates to ""In the aftermath of the great destruction of the Exile, the house was in need.""  This directly refers to the importance of their homes. The passage also details the destruction of their homes and the lack of proper dwellings.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Maxelo ya vona (Their traditions):** While traditions were undoubtedly important, the passage focuses on the physical destruction and lack of housing.
* **B: Switolo swa vona (Their possessions):** The passage mentions possessions like furniture, but the primary emphasis is on the lack of shelter.
* **D: Ndlela ya vona ya ku sweka (Their way of life):**  While the passage touches on hardships, the core concern is the destruction of their homes and the lack of a place to live.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriwangiki tanihi ku hambana exikarhi ka matiko ya Scandinavia?,"The correct answer is **A: Matimu**.

The passage states: ""hambiloko tiko rin’wana ni rin’wana a ku ri ra ‘Scandinavia’, a ku ri ni swilo swo tala leswi hambaneke exikarhi ka vanhu, tihosi, **mikhuva ni matimu** ya le Denmark, Sweden, Norway ni Iceland.""

Therefore, the differences between the Scandinavian countries included **clothing** (matimu).
"
I va mani lava nga tshama a Greenland ku sungula?,"The correct answer is **C: Erik the Red**.

The passage states: ""Eka swiviko swa Norse va ku Erik the Red u hlongoriwe a Iceland hikwalaho ko dlaya, naswona loko a teke riendzo ku ya emahlweni a vupela-dyambu, u kume Greenland ivi a yi thya vito ra Greenland."" This translates to: ""According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled to Iceland because of a quarrel, and when he sailed east, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.""
"
I ntlawa wihi lowu a wu rhandza ku dya swakudya swa vona wu nga tshamanga eswitulwini?,"The correct answer is **C: Vavanuna va van’wankumi va Marhoma**.

The text states: ""Ku katsa ni nguluve ya nhova, phikoko, swihumbana, ni muxaka wa makondlo lowu vitaniwaka dormouse Ku hambana kun’wana i leswaku loko swisiwana ni **vavanuna va van’wankumi va Marhoma** va dya swakudya swa vona va tshame exitulwini..."" This indicates that the cooks (vavanuna) of the Marhoma (presumably referring to the people who prepared and ate the food) stayed outside while the food was being eaten.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ta tshuka swi va xiphemu xa swakudya swa khale swa Varhoma?,"The correct answer is **A: Vaendzi va xisiwana va dya va tshame eswitulwini** (The ancient people stopped eating in the corner).

The passage explicitly states: ""ku katsa ni nguluve ya nhova, phikoko, swihumbana, ni muxaka wa makondlo lowu vitaniwaka dormouse Ku hambana kun’wana i leswaku loko swisiwana ni vavasati va dya swakudya swa vona va tshame exitulwini..."" (It also included rats, cockroaches, ants, and a type of mouse called dormouse. Another thing is that when the ancient people ate their food, they stopped in the corner...).

Therefore, option A accurately reflects a behavior associated with eating ancient Roman food.  The other options are either incorrect or not directly supported by the text.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nge endlekiki leswaku swi va ni nkucetelo lowu nga heriki?","The correct answer is **B: Ndhavuko lowutsongo (Ancient tradition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mindhavuko leyitsongo hakanyingi ya nyamalala yi nga siyi vumbhoni va matimu lebyi faneleke naswona yi tsandzeka ku xiyeka tanihi ku tshama swi’nwe loku kahle.""  This translates to: ""Ancient traditions often die out and do not leave evidence of appropriate behavior, and they allow for the development of civilizing forces.""

Therefore, the passage directly links the lack of appropriate behavior to the decline of ancient traditions.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vaaka-tiko (Civilizations):** Civilizations are a *result* of the development of ""tshama swin'e"" (civilizing forces), not the cause of inappropriate behavior.
*   **C: Tiko-doroba (City-states):** City-states are a *manifestation* of civilizations, not the cause of inappropriate behavior.
*   **D: Ndhavuko wa ku tshama swin’e (Civilizing forces):**  The passage says ""tshama swin'e"" *allow* for civilizing forces, it doesn't say they *cause* the lack of appropriate behavior. It's a more nuanced relationship.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi rhangeleke tiko?","The correct answer is **A: Ndhavuko wa ku tshama swin’we**.

The text explicitly states: ""P: Ku tshama swin’we ka vanhu i ndhavuko wun’we lowu hlanganyeriwaka i ntlawa lowukulu swinene wa vanhu la va hanyaka ni ku tirha swin’we, i vaaka-tiko."" which translates to ""P: The concept of civilization is one of the most significant elements that are interwoven in the lives of people who live together and work together, which is a society.""  The question asks what the text identifies as the characteristic of a society.

Therefore, ""Ndhavuko wa ku tshama swin’we"" (The concept of civilization) is the accurate answer.
"
I swiga swihi leswi nga riki ntiyiso hi Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Ri endliwe ku tsundzuka loko ku hluriwa mavuthu ya Tibetan-Mongol**.

Here's why:

* The provided text explicitly states: ""Ku vuriwa leswaku hi 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel u endle khokholo leri ku tsundzuka loko a hlula mavuthu ya Tibetan-Mongol."" (It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel made a chorten that was built when he defeated the Tibetan-Mongol forces.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ri le la ndhawu ya Bhutan:** While Drukgyal Dzong *is* in Bhutan, the question asks what *isn't* true about it. Being located in Bhutan isn't a falsehood.
* **C: Ndzilo wu lovise swo tala swa swilo leswi saleke:** The text says the chorten was *built* when the Tibetan-Mongol forces were defeated, not that the defeat *caused* the ruins.
* **D: Ri endliwe hi Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** The text says he *made* the chorten, which is a more precise wording than ""built it.""

Therefore, the only option that is explicitly stated as true in the text is that the chorten was built when Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel defeated the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
"
I swiga swihi leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma mbuyelo wa ndzilo e Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Xilo lexi saleke ntsena a ku ri xifaniso xa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Hi 1951, ndzilo wu vange leswaku swin’wana swa swilo leswi saleke swa Drukgyal Dzong swi tshama swi ri kona, ku fana ni xifaniso xa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""  This means the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was among the relics that disappeared.  The fact that the statue was missing likely contributed to the disruption and eventual dismantling of the Dzong.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mavuthu ya Tibetan-Mongol ma hlurile:** The text says Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel made the relics *after* the Tibetan-Mongol wars. So, the wars themselves didn't cause the relics to disappear.
* **C: Ku rhandziwa ka xona a ku khumbekanga:** The text says the relics were highly revered. Therefore, a lack of reverence wouldn't explain their disappearance.
* **D: Ri hlayisiwe hi Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:**  The text states the relics *disappeared* after the war, not that they were deliberately destroyed by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki ntiyiso hi Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **C: Cambodia yi hlaseriwe hi vanhu va le Vietnam emasungulweni ya lembe-xidzana ra vu-18**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what happened *next* in Cambodian history.** The provided text states that after the first attack by Thailand in 1772, Vietnam attacked Cambodia.
* **Option C accurately reflects this event.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vanhu va le Vietnam va lovise Phnom Phen** - While Vietnam *did* eventually capture Phnom Penh, the text doesn't say this happened immediately after the initial Thai attack.  The text states that Vietnam attacked Cambodia *later* in the 18th century.
* **B: Vanhu va le Cambodia va hlaseli Thailand hi 1772** - The text says Thailand attacked Cambodia in 1772, not the other way around.
* **D: Vanhu va le Thailand va lovise Phnom Phen** - The text states Vietnam captured Phnom Penh, not Thailand.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma ku hlaseriwa ka Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **B: Vanhu va le Thailand ni vanhu va le Vietnam va hlasele Cambodia hi 1772.**

Here's why:

* The provided text states: ""Thailand ni Vietnam Vanbu va le Thaiwan va hlaseli Cambodia kotalanyana hi lembe xidzana ra vu-18 kambe hi 1772 va lovisi Phnom Phen."" (Thailand and Vietnam, along with Taiwan, attacked Cambodia together in the 18th century and captured Phnom Penh in 1772.)
* It also states: ""Emalembeni yo hetelela ya lembe-xidzana ra vu-18 vanhu va le Vietnam va hlasele Cambodia kambe."" (In the subsequent 18th century, Vietnamese people attacked Cambodia again.)

Option B accurately reflects this information by mentioning both Thailand and Vietnam attacking Cambodia in 1772.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vanhu va le Vietnam va hlaseli Cambodia minkarhi yo tala** - While Vietnam attacked Cambodia later in the 18th century, the text doesn't state they were the first to attack. Thailand was also involved.
* **C: Vanhu va le Vietnam va lovise Phnom Phen** - This is only one part of the story; Thailand and others were also involved in the attack on Phnom Penh.
* **D: Vanhu va le Thailand va hlaseli Cambodia minkarhi yo tala** - The text doesn't state that Thailand was the first to attack.

I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi khampani ya Dutch East India yi nga swi endlanga hi nkarhi wa vona le Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **B: Yi endle mikhuva ya ntshovelo wa mavele ya vaaki vo rhanga**.

The passage states: ""Hi 1624, Khampani ya Dutch East India yi ake govela edzonga-vupela-dyambu bya Taiwan, yi sungula ku hundzula mikhuva ya ntshovelo wa mavele ya vaaki vo rhanga..."" which translates to ""In 1624, the Dutch East India Company arrived at the Taiwan strait, and began to establish settlements of early European colonists...""

Options A, C, and D describe events that happened *after* the Dutch East India Company arrived, not what they initially did.
"
Ntwanano wa le Shimonoseki wu simeke yini?,"The correct answer is **C: Vuswikoti bya Taiwan ku lawula tindhawu ta le ribuweni**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Hi 1895, endzhaku ka ku hluriwa Enyimpini Yo sungula ya Machayina na Majapani (1894-1895) hulumende wa Qing u sayine Ntwanano wa le Shimonoseki, hi ku endla tano wu nyiketela mfumo wa Taiwan eka Japani..."" This means the treaty resulted in Taiwan being ceded to Japan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hluriwa ka Japani Enyimpini Yo sungula ya Machayina na Majapani:** While the treaty *led to* Japan taking control, it doesn't *define* the treaty itself.
* **B: Xiyimo xa Taiwan tanihi xifundzha ehansi ka ntlhandlamano wa tihosi wa Qing:** This is true, but the question asks what the Shimonoseki Treaty *meant*. The treaty changed Taiwan's political status, not just described it.
* **D: Vulawuri bya Japani eka Taiwan:**  The treaty *resulted in* Japanese rule, but the treaty itself isn't the laws of Japan.



"
Mpimo wa pH ya khemikhali wu pimanetiwa njhani?,"The correct answer is **C: Nhlayo ya tiayoni ta hayidirojeni eka khemikhali**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Mpimo wa pH wu titshege hi mpimo wa ti ayoni ta hayidirojeni (H eka pH) eka khemikhali leyi pimiwaka."" (The pH value is based on the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the substance.)
*  The passage also explains that hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mpimo wa khemikhali i asidi kumbe beyizi:** While acids and bases *have* different pH values, the pH *value* itself is determined by the concentration of hydrogen ions, not simply whether something is an acid or a base.
* **B: Ku ni tiphorothoni ti ngani eka khemikhali:**  The presence of protons is related to hydrogen ions, but the *amount* of hydrogen ions is what determines pH.
* **D: Ku ni tielekitironi ti ngani eka khemikhali:**  Electrons are involved in the structure of atoms, but the pH value is specifically related to the concentration of hydrogen ions (protons).



"
I yini leswi nga susiwa eka tiayoni ta hayidirojeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Tiphorotoni (Protons)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mpimo wa pH wu titshege hi mpimo wa ti ayoni ta hayidirojeni (H eka pH) eka khemikhali leyi pimiwaka. Ti ayoni ta hayidirojeni i ti phurothoni leti ti tekeriweke ti elekitironi ta tona...""

This translates to: ""The pH scale is based on the concentration of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in a solution. Hydrogen ions are called protons which have lost their electrons...""

Therefore, protons are the components that are being discussed in relation to hydrogen ions and the pH scale.
"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ntlhambi wa tinghala?,"The correct answer is **A: Wu tikhoma ku fana na timbyana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mintlhambi ya tinghala yi ti khoma ni ku fana na timbyana ta khwati kumbe timbyana..."" This directly translates to ""The claws of the hyena are used to resemble the claws of a cub or a young animal...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nhlayo ya ta xinuna ni ta vavasati a yi ringani:** The passage says the hyena's claws are used to resemble the claws of a cub/young animal, but it *doesn't* say the hyena's mouth and jaws are the same.
* **C: Ta xinuna ni ta vavasati i maxaka:** While the passage mentions hyenas come in different sizes, it doesn't say their jaws and mouths are different types.
* **D: Havumbirhi ta dlaya naswona ti rhandza ku tshama swin’we:** The passage says hyenas eat carrion and like to travel in groups, but the question asks about what happens *after* a hyena's claw is removed.  The passage doesn't describe what occurs *after* the removal of a claw.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ku tikhoma ka tinghala?,"The correct answer is **C: Havumbirhi ta xinuna ni ta vavasati ti dlaya ngopfu eka leswi swi ti dlayaka.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Mintlhambi yi vumbiwa hi nghala yin’we ya xinuna ku ya eka tinharhu letikulu, swin’we ni ta vavasati leti fikaka eka makume manharhu swin’we ni letitsongo.""  This means the mother and offspring (the young) eat a lot of the food the ants collect. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti na rhandza ku tshama swin’we (They like to travel with others):** The passage mentions ants traveling together, but it's not directly linked to the consequences of them biting.
* **B: Ku tikhoma ka tona ku fana ni timbyana ta khwati (Biting is like biting a kitten):** The passage compares the ants' bite to a kitten's bite, but it doesn't describe what happens *after* biting.
* **D: Ku tikhoma ka tona ku fana ni swimanga swin’wana leswikulu (Biting is like biting other large animals):** The passage mentions that ant bites are like a kitten's bite and ants eat large food. It does not make comparisons with other large animals.



"
Hi wihi muxaka wa swiharhi leswi ku tolovelekeke leswaku swidya mimpfundla?,"The correct answer is **C: Swimanga leswi nga riki swikulu kumbe switsongo**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Hi wihi muxaka wa swiharhi leswi ku tolovelekeke leswaku swidya mimpfundla?"" (What is the type of predators that are common in the process of hunting?)
* **The passage states:** ""Xa mahetelelo, ku na swimanga swo tala leswitsongo...leswi dyaka swilo swo tala leswitsongo leswitsotswana, makondlo, nkolobywani na swinyenyani."" (In the morning, there are early predators...those that are small and early predators like snakes, lizards, spiders, and insects.)
* **The passage further defines the hunting process as:** ""Hi hlawulekeke lowu endliwaka hi ximanga xin’wana ni xin’wana lexi xi wu endlaka handle ka ku phikizana na xin’wana."" (It is a process that is done by one animal chasing another in order to catch it.)

Therefore, the predators described are small, early predators - not large or big predators.  Option C accurately reflects this description.
"
Swimanga leswitsongo swi hlota yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Makondlo**

The text states: ""Xihundla xa ku humelela ka tona i vito ra ku tsaka, ntirho lowu hlawulekeke lowu wu endliwaka hi ximanga xin’wana ni xin’wana lexi xi wu endlaka handle ka ku phikizana na xin’wana. **Makondlo, ntirho lowu hlawulekeke lowu wu endliwaka hi ximanga xin’wana ni xin’wana lexi xi wu endlaka handle ka ku phikizana na xin’wana.**""

This indicates that the ""tsaka"" (a type of migration) leads to the formation of **makondlo** (swarms).
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xiphemu xa ndlela ya ku hlota ya ocelot?,"The correct answer is **A: Yi ti fanisa na ndhawu ya yona**.

The text states: ""Ti-ocelot ti hlota hi ku ti fanisa na ndhawu leyi swihari leswi ti swi dyaka swi tshamaka eka yona..."" which translates to ""Ocelots hunt by camouflaging themselves with the environment where the prey animals are...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yi landzelela ku nhun’whela ka swihari leswi yi swi dyaka:** While ocelots might stalk prey, the primary method described for hunting is camouflage.
* **C: Yi landzelela swihari leswitsongo nivusiku:** The text mentions they are difficult to see at night, but doesn't say they *specifically* stalk prey at night. The camouflage applies to daytime hunting too.
* **D: Yi hlota swihari leswitsongo ntsena:**  The text indicates they hunt prey animals, not just any animals.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ku nun’hwela ka yona a ku tsanile (It is able to stalk well)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Va n’wasayense va ehleketa leswaku ti-ocelot ti landzela kumbe ti kuma swihari leswi ti swi dyaka hi ku nhun’wheta ndhawu leyi a swi famba eka yona."" This translates to ""Scientists believe that ocelots stalk or hunt prey by creeping along the ground."" 

The passage also mentions they are well-camouflaged at night, which supports the idea of stealth and stalking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi kota ku hlota kahle nivusiku (It can stalk well at night):** While true, it doesn't explain *what* makes them good at stalking.
* **B: Yi famba yi miyerile (It walks quietly):** Similar to A, it doesn't fully explain the stalking behavior.
* **D: Yi rhandza ku hlota swihari leswitsongo (It likes to stalk prey):**  The passage *says* they stalk prey, but the question asks what is *special* about the stalking behavior. The answer highlights the *skill* of stalking.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki vuswikoti lebyikulu bya yingwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku vomba**.

The text states: ""Yingwe yi na vuswikoti byo tala, yi nga khandziya (hambiloko yi nga swi koti swinene), yi nga hlambela, yi tlula mpfhuka wo leha ngopfu naswona hi matimba lama hundzaka la ku phindiweke ka nharhu eka munhu loyi nga na matimba. **Swimanga leswi swa mune hi swona ntsena leswi kotaka ku vomba.**""

This translates to: ""Lions have sharp claws, they can bite (initially they don't intend to), they can slash, they can throw off a lot of weight with powerful muscles developed over time in a fight with a person who has strength. **The roar of lions themselves is what is associated with roaring.**""

Therefore, the text explicitly links roaring to the lions.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga ku hambana exikarhi ka tiyingwe ni tinghala?","The correct answer is **A: Vuswikoti bya tona bya ku hlambela (Their vocalizations)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yingwe yi nga khandziya (hambiloko yi nga swi koti swinene), yi nga hlambela..."" which translates to ""Lions can roar (initially they don't want to), they can growl..."" 

The passage then contrasts lion vocalizations with those of tigers, noting that lion growls resemble a human's growl when they are in pain.  The other options are either characteristics shared by both lions and tigers (like hunting prowess and strength) or are not specifically contrasted in the text.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Robert Hooke u endle yini emahlweni ka vutivi va dyondzo ya bayoloji?","The correct answer is **A: Ku vona tisele leti feke**.

The text states: ""A a ri munhu wo sungula ku vona tisele leti feke."" which translates to ""He was the first person to see these artificial cells.""  While he observed cell walls and structures, the key takeaway is that he observed *artificial* (created) cells, which is what the answer choice A refers to.
"
Rito ro sungula ra “sele” ri vula yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Kamara leyitsongo**.

The text states: ""Sele ri huma eka rito ra Xintariyani cella leri vulaka kamara leri tsongo."" which translates to ""Cell (cell) comes from the name of a plant cell that opened a **tiled room**."" (The word for ""room"" here is ""kamara"").

While the other options relate to aspects of cells, the text directly links ""sele"" to a tiled room, which is synonymous with a **tiled chamber** or **tiled compartment** – essentially, a **tiled room**.  However, the options provided offer ""Kamara leyitsongo"" (tiled room). Therefore, this is the best and most accurate translation in the context of the question and the provided options.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, swihari swo tala swi ni vuswikoti byo endla yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku haha**.

The text states: ""Swiharhi swi tlhela swi haha exibakabakeni."" which translates to ""Jellyfish always drift in the currents.""  ""Haha"" means to drift or float.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi swihari swin’wana swi nga riki na swona?","The correct answer is **C: Byongo (Jellyfish)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""I swiharhi ntsena leswi nga ni byongo..."" which translates to ""Jellyfish are not even those that have stinging cells...""  This directly links jellyfish (a type of jellyfish) to the absence of stinging cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tisele (Food):**  The passage says jellyfish eat things (""Swi dya swilo naswona swi gayela endzeni""), so they *do* consume food.
* **B: Vuswikoti byo gayela (Stinging cells):** The text *directly* says jellyfish lack stinging cells.
* **D: Vuswikoti bya ku dya (Eating cells):** The passage states they eat, but doesn't say they have specific ""eating cells"" that other jellyfish don't.

Therefore, the only answer directly supported by the provided text is **C: Byongo (Jellyfish)** which refers to the lack of stinging cells."
I yini leswi pfunaka swimila eka fambiselo ra fothosinitesisi?,"The correct answer is **D: Dyambu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swimila swi endla swakudya hi dyambu eka fothosinitesisi."" This translates to ""Plants make food using carbon dioxide in photosynthesis."" Therefore, the key component plants need for photosynthesis is carbon dioxide (dyambu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndzuti (Oxygen):** While plants release oxygen, it's a *product* of photosynthesis, not a reactant.
*   **B: Swihari (Sugar):** Sugar is the *food* plants create, not a necessary ingredient for the process.
*   **C: Swakudya (Food):**  ""Swakudya"" is a general term for food, but the passage specifically mentions *dyambu* (carbon dioxide) as what plants use in photosynthesis to *make* food.



"
Vanhu va humesela yini ehandle leyi swimila swi yi hefumulaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Khaboni-dayiokisayidi**.

The provided text states: ""Swimila swi hefemula khaboni-dayiokisayidi leyi vanhu va yi humesaka (sweswo swivula leswaku, leswi va swi humeselaka ehandle).""  This translates to ""Plants absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale (meaning, they release it into the air).""

Therefore, humans exhale carbon dioxide, and plants absorb it.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga swikombiso leswi nga sivelaka fambiselo ra ku tiendlekela ka swilo?","The correct answer is **C: Swihari swi titoloveta ku hanya endhawini leyintshwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after the initial separation, the old species are forced to adapt or face extinction, and the new species adapt to their new environment. This adaptation *involves* migration to the new location. Options A, B, and D don't accurately reflect the core process described in the passage. Option C captures the crucial movement that initiates the adaptation and eventual divergence.
"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma fambiselo ra speciation? ,"The correct answer is **C: Swi vula ku vumbeka ka swihari leswintshwa.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that speciation ""vulaaka ku endliwa ka swivumbiwa leswintshwa"" which translates to ""opens up the creation of new species.""  The question asks what *results* from the consequences of the speciation model.  The passage explains that speciation *leads to* the emergence of distinct species.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Swi humelela loko swihari leswintshwa swi tsandzeka ku tolovela** (It happens when new populations become isolated): While isolation is *often* a factor in speciation, the text isn't solely focusing on the isolation process.  It's describing the overall result.
*   **B: I xiphemu xa nkoka xa fambiselo ra ku tiendlekela ka swilo** (It's a crucial component of the theory of evolution): Speciation *is* crucial to the theory of evolution, but the question is about the *consequences* of the speciation model itself.
*   **D: Ku humelela ka swona a ku nge papalateki** (Its occurrence is unpredictable): The text states speciation is a *non-random* process (i.e., it's not unpredictable)."
I xiphemu xihi xa mafambiselo ya ngati lama rhendzelekaka lexi tisaka ngati embilwini?,"The correct answer is **B: Tikhaphilari**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiphayiphi letitsongo ti vitaniwa tikhaphilari."" This translates to ""The pipes that carry [the fluid] are called capillaries.""

Therefore, capillaries are the pipes that transport the fluid. The other options are incorrect:

*   **Tiatheri** and **Tivheyini** are mentioned as part of the system, but not the primary pipes that carry the fluid.
*   **Swirho** means ""things"" or ""stuff"" and is not a specific part of the circulatory system."
I tiphayiphi tihi letitsongo-tsongo eka mafambiselo ya ngati lama rhendzelekaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Tikhaphilari**.

The passage states: ""Tiphayiphi letitsongo ti vitaniwa tikhaphilari."" which translates to ""The pipes that carry the blood are called capillaries.""
"
Vuswikoti bya switsotswana bya ku tumbela timpiko ta swona byi andzisa yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Mphakelo wa swakudya**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the lifecycle of dragonflies and mayflies *depends* on the availability of insects for food. The question asks what the lifecycle *provides* for what comes next.  The lifecycle provides a food source.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Tindhawu to tumbela:** While the lifecycle *requires* certain habitats, the question asks what it *provides* for what *comes next*.
* **C: Ku kuma vanghani va vukati:**  While mating is part of the lifecycle, it's not the primary ""something"" the lifecycle provides.
* **D: Rivilo ra ku haha:** Reproduction is a part of the lifecycle, but not the direct consequence for what follows.

Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer is that the lifecycle of dragonflies and mayflies provides a **food source** for other creatures.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga si vuriwa eka ndzimana tanihi xilo lexi khumbiwaka hi vuswikoti bya ku haha ka switsotswana?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku hlengeleta swakudya** (Searching for food).

Here's why:

The passage states that Switsotswana (dragonflies) are predators that hunt and eat other insects. The question asks what *doesn't* happen due to their hunting behavior.  The passage explicitly mentions they hunt ""to eat other insects and small creatures."" Therefore, searching for food is a direct consequence of their hunting/predatory behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku veleka (To flee/escape):** Switsotswana *catch* things; they don't flee.
*   **B: Mpimo wa vutomi (Life cycle):** The passage doesn't focus on the life cycle; it describes their predatory behavior.
*   **D: Ku tirha kahle (To work well):** While hunting is a form of ""working,"" the passage doesn't specifically describe their hunting as ""working well."" It simply states that they hunt.



"
I swihlawulekisi swihi leswi hi ntolovelo swi nga fambisaniki na tidayinasora?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku famba hi milenge ya le ndzhaku (Walking on two legs)**.

Here's why:

* The text mentions ""matandza naswona swi famba hi milenge ya le ndzhaku ku fana na T-Rex"" (bipedal creatures that walked on two legs, like a T-Rex). This directly links bipedalism (walking on two legs) to the dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Tinsiva (Claws):** While claws are mentioned as a feature of dinosaurs, they aren't the key characteristic that connects them to modern animals. Many animals have claws.
* **C: Ku vekela matandza (Being bipedal):** This is the same as option A, but option A is more specific and directly supported by the text mentioning the similarity to a T-Rex.
* **D: Milenge leyi nga ni minwala (Having spines/bones):**  While dinosaurs had bones, this is a very general characteristic shared with many animals. The text specifies the *type* of bone structure (like the bones in modern animals).



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga tekiwiki tanihi xihlawulekisi xa swinyenyani ni ti dayinasora?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku vekela matandza (Fossilization)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the existence of dinosaurs was initially doubted, but later, **fossils** of creatures with dinosaur-like characteristics (bones, teeth, claws, and scales) were discovered. These fossils provided evidence for their existence and their evolution over time.  The passage explicitly mentions ""Ku ni swilo swo tala eka swinyenyana leswi fanaka ni swa dayinasora Swi na milenge leyi nga ni mahakatimba na minwala, **swi vekela matandza** naswona swi famba hi milenge ya le ndzhaku ku fana na T-Rex."" (There are early things in small animals similar to dinosaurs with claws and teeth and scales, **leading to fossils** that walked on land like a T-Rex.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ku famba hi milenge ya le ndzhaku (Walking on land):** While dinosaurs did walk on land, this is a *characteristic* that fossils revealed, not the reason why they are considered evidence.
* **C: Vuswikoti bya ku haha (The ability to lay eggs):** The passage mentions egg-laying (""Vuswikoti bya ku haha""), but this is not the primary reason fossils are important for dinosaur evidence. Many reptiles lay eggs.
* **D: Milenge leyi nga ni minwala (Limbs with claws/teeth):**  These are characteristics *found* in the fossils, not the mechanism by which the fossils exist and provide evidence.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiphemu xihi xa swimila swa ncindzu lexi ku nga endlekaka leswaku Triceratop yi xi dya?","The correct answer is **A: Matluka lama nga tsontswa (Bone marrow)**.

Here's why: The passage explicitly states: ""Swimila leswi swi fana na murhi wa ncindzu lowutsongo lowu nga ni harhi ya matluka lama tlhavaka, ni lama nga tsontswa."" which translates to ""Fossils similar to bone marrow that have no hard parts, and that can be extracted.""  It further explains that scientists believe Triceratops used its beak to extract bone marrow from the bones of prey.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nsinya (Fish):** The passage mentions Triceratops *might* have eaten fish, but it focuses on bone marrow as a primary food source.
*   **C: Timitsu (Fossils):** Fossils are the remains of ancient organisms, not a food source.
*   **D: Mbhandzu (Meat):** The passage mentions that some scientists think Triceratops *might* have eaten meat, but it focuses on extracting bone marrow.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi Triceratop swi nga endlekaka leswaku yi swi dya? ","The correct answer is **D: Swimila leswi nga ni mbhandzu lowu nga ni chefu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Swimila leswi swi fana na murhi wa ncindzu lowutsongo lowu nga ni harhi ya matluka lama tlhavaka, ni lama nga tsontswa. Triceratops a yi ta va yi tirhisa nomu wa yona lowu nga tiya ku susa matluka yi nga si dya nsinya.""

This indicates Triceratops used its beak to tear at carcasses (animals with bones and flesh) and that scavengers (animals that eat dead things) also had beaks. The text then goes on to compare the behavior to modern sloths and anteaters, which also have beaks and eat carcasses.

Option D directly reflects this comparison.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka mintlangu leyi landzelaka leyi swi nga endlekaka leswaku yi va leyi rhandziwaka ngopfu eswifundzheni swa le N’walungu ya Italiya?","The correct answer is **D: Mphikisano wa timovha wa F1**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Formula 1 racing is mentioned along with other popular sports.
* It specifically mentions that ""Mintlango ya xixika leyi rhandziwaka eswifundzheni swa le N’walungu, yi na vanhu va Italiya lava phikisanaka eka mintlango ya matiko ni mintlango ya ti Olympiki."" (The most popular sports in the Italian championships, include Italians competing in both Olympic and sporting events.)
* Formula 1 is a major international sport with strong ties to Italy, and Italian drivers have a long and successful history in the sport.  This makes it a very popular sport in Italy.
* The other options are mentioned as part of a list of sports, but the passage doesn't emphasize their popularity *specifically within Italian championships* to the same degree as it does for F1.



"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, i ntlangu wihi eka leyi landzelaka lowu nga hlula ku va tinghwazi ta misava eItaliya?","The answer is **A: Bolo ya milenge**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bolo ya milenge ya tiko ra Italiya, swin’we ni bolo ya milenge ya tiko ra Xijarimani..."" This directly links Italian soccer (bolo ya milenge) to being a world-class sport in Italy.  The passage then goes on to mention Italy's success in various sports, but the initial statement focuses on soccer as a key sport for Italy.
"
Hi le ndzhaku ka xiendlakalo xihi laha swiphemu swin’wana swa Luxembourg swi nga va Belgium?,"The correct answer is **B: Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Belgium**.

The passage states: ""Swiphemu swa Belgium ya namuntlha a ku ri xiphemu xa Luxembourg hi nkarhi lowu hundzeke kambe yi xiphemu xa Belgium endzhaku ka Nhlunga-vuhosi wa le Belgium was 1830.""  This directly links the Belgian Revolution of 1830 to Luxembourg becoming part of Belgium.

While the other options are related to Luxembourg's history, they aren't the *direct* cause of Luxembourg becoming part of Belgium.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga khumba vukala-tlhelo bya Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hlaseriwa hi Jarimani**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Luxembourg a yi tshama yi ringeta ku tshama yi ri tiko leri nga ni vukala-tlhelo kambe yi hlaseriwe hi Jarimani hi Nyimpi yo Sungula ya Misava ni Nyimpi ya Vumbirhi ya Misava hi vumbirhi."" (Luxembourg was striving to be an independent state but was invaded by Germany in both World War I and World War II.)

While the other options are related to Luxembourg's history, the invasion by Germany is specifically mentioned as a factor that *diminished* its independence.  The other options are either reasons it *became* independent (European Union) or a historical event that led to a change in its political status but not necessarily a *diminishment* of sovereignty in the same way as the invasions. Therefore, the invasion is the most direct answer to the question of what diminished Luxembourg's independence.

I swikwere-khilomitara swingani swa ndhawu hinkwayo ya Turkey le Yuropa?,"The correct answer is **A: 9174**.

The text states: ""Ndhawu ya Turkey yi yi endla tiko ra vu 37 lerikulu emisaveni, naswona yi ringana ni Doroba ra Furwa ni United Kingdom swi hlanganile. Italiya yi rhendzeleriwe hi malwandle ematlhelweni manharhu: Lwandle ra Aegean ku ya evupela-dyambu, Lwandle ra Ntima ku ya n’walungwini ni Lwandle ra Mediteraniya ku ya edzongeni.""

This section provides context for the size of Turkey, comparing it to France and the UK, and mentioning the seas surrounding Italy. It then states that Turkey has a land area of 23,764 sq mi (9,174 sq km) in Europe.  Therefore, the answer is 9174 (km²), which is equivalent to 23764 square miles.  Looking at the options, 9174 is the closest match.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Turkey yi lehe timayili tingani?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Ndhawu ya Turkey i hundza tikhilomitara ta 1,600 (1,000 miles)..."" which directly translates to Turkey's coastline is 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles).
"
Ririmi ra Xilatin ri tirhiseriwa yini eka Vatican City?,"The correct answer is **A: Minkhuvo ya vukhongeri (Ceremonial)**.

The text states: ""Vatican City yi tirhisa Xintariyani eka mfumo wa vona ni le ka ku vulavurisana kale nawini. **Xintariyani xi tlhela ku va ririmu leri tirhisiwaka eka vutomi bya siku ni siku leri tirhisiwaka hi lava tirhaka eka mfumo kasi Xilatin xi tirhisiwa eka minkhuvo ya vukhongeri minkarhi yin’wana.**""

This translates to: ""Vatican City uses Italian in its administration and also for communication now. **Latin is always used for ceremonial events at times.**""

Therefore, Latin is used for ceremonies, not for daily life or administration.
"
"Le Vatican City, Xintariyani a xi tirhisiweli yini?","The correct answer is **A: Eka mfumo (In government)**.

The text states: ""Vatican City yi tirhisa Xintariyani eka mfumo wa vona..."" which translates to ""Vatican City uses Italian in its government...""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leyi vuyeriwaka eka ku hlanganisa mimpfumawulo eka tikhompyutha ta xiyimo xa le henhla?","The correct answer is **C: Swifaniso**.

Here's why:

The question asks what happens *after* combining data on a high-performance computer. The text states: ""Vuyimbeleri nkarhi wun’wana byi kandziyisiwa hi ku tirhisa tikhompyutha ta xiyimo xa le henhla leswaku ti fambisa ni ku hlanganisa mimpfumawulo yo hambana."" This translates to ""Visualizations are often created using a high-performance computer to process and combine diverse data.""

The key term here is ""mimpfumawulo yo hambana"" which means ""diverse data"" or ""different data sets"".  Combining different data sets often leads to the creation of **swifaniso** (comparisons, correlations, relationships). This is what's typically derived *after* the data is processed and combined.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vuyimbeleri (Visualizations):** Visualizations are the *result* of combining data, not what happens immediately after.
*   **B: Tipopayi (Applications):** Applications use the combined data, but they are not the immediate outcome of the combination process itself.
*   **D: Ku endliwa (Creation):** ""Ku endliwa"" means ""creation"" or ""making"". While the data is being created in some sense, it's not the *direct* consequence of combining data in the context of the question.

Therefore, **swifaniso (comparisons/relationships)** is the most logical and accurate answer."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, hi ku tala ka makaya ya le ka ndhawu yihi lama nga ni swihambukelo swo tirhisa mati?","The correct answer is **A: E Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage specifically states: ""Madoroba ya Harappa na Mohenjo-daro a ya ri na xihambukelo xo tirhisa mati eka kwalomu ka tiyindlu hinkwato..."" (The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a remarkable innovation using water for the construction of houses, with a sophisticated drainage system).

While other civilizations also had water management, Mohenjo-daro is explicitly mentioned as having this notable innovation.
"
Hi le ka tindhawu tihi eka leti landzelaka laha ku nga kumiwa soreji ya xiyimo xa le henhla?,"The correct answer is **B: E Santorini**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Masalela ya mafambiselo ya nkululo ma kumekile eka tiyindlu ta le madorobeni ya **Minoan eCrete na Santorini eGreece**.""  This means Minoan civilization in Crete and Santorini demonstrates a similar type of drainage system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Le Harappa:** The passage mentions Harappa as having advanced drainage, but it doesn't directly link it to the Minoan civilization as a parallel example of drainage systems.
*   **C: E Egipta:** The passage specifically notes *differences* in Egypt.
*   **D: E Chayina:** The passage also mentions differences in China.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi endlaka munhu loyi a tswiririkaka eayisini a jika?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku voyamela etlhelo ehansi ka nsimbi ya xilo xa ku tswiririka eayisini.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Loko nsimbi yi voyamela etlhelo rin’wana, tlhelo leri khumbaneke ni ayisi na rona ra voyama."" (When the soil dries out at one end, the protruding root and the asphalt also dry out.)  This drying out at the soil level is what causes the plant to become unstable and the person walking on it to fall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matlhelo mambirhi eka nsimbi ya xilo xa ku tswiririka eayisini** (The two roots of the plant in the asphalt): While the roots are mentioned, it's the drying out *at the soil level* that's the immediate cause of the fall, not the roots themselves.
* **C: Mpimo wa vuswikoti bya munhu loyi a tswiriririkaka eayisini** (The physical condition of the person who walks on the asphalt): The passage doesn't mention anything about the person's physical condition.
* **D: Xiyimo xa ayisi** (The nature of the asphalt):  The asphalt is a component of the problem (drying out *with* the roots), but it's the drying out *at the soil level* that leads to the fall.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma ku goveka ka nsimbi ya xilo xa ku tswiririka eayisini xa masiku lama?","The correct answer is **C: Ku gombonyoka (It is cracking)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where a crack appears in a solid surface (likely a path or ground).  The crack spreads, and the cracking continues to the point where it causes people to trip.  The text specifically states that the crack ""gombonyoka"" (cracks/splits).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matlhelo mambirhi (Two lobes):** While the passage mentions two lobes, the core issue isn't the number of lobes, but the resulting crack.
* **B: Yi voyamela etlhelo (It spreads to the lobes):** While the crack spreads, this is a *result* of the cracking, not the initial event.
* **D: Yi voyamile (It is worn out):** The passage indicates the surface *was* solid before cracking. Wearing out is a different process.



Therefore, ""ku gombonyoka"" - **it is cracking**- accurately describes the initial phenomenon that leads to all the subsequent events.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini fambiselo ra ku pfumelela tiathomu ku susa matimba lama engetelekeke lama ti ma kumeke eka rivoningo?","The correct answer is **D: Mahumeselo ya nyawuso lama endliweke**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that scientists call the process of atoms emitting energy and creating light ""spontaneous emission of virtual photons."" Option D directly reflects this description. The other options are partially correct but not as specific as D.

*   **A: Nyanyuso (Spontaneity):** While spontaneity is a part of the process, it's not the *name* of the phenomenon.
*   **B: Mahumeselo ya tifothoni leti endliweke (Virtual photons):** This is *part* of the correct answer but the full phrase from the passage is needed.
*   **C: Tifothoni (Photons):** Photons are the particles emitted, but not the *process* of emission itself.

Therefore, **Mahumeselo ya nyawuso lama endliweke (Spontaneous emission of virtual photons)** is the most accurate and complete answer based on the provided text."
I yini lexi vangaka leswaku athomu yi humesa fothoni?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku endliwa loku vangiwaka hi rivoni leri vangamaka.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Va n’wasayense va vita fambiselo leri nge “mahumeselo ya nyawuso lama endliweke” hikuva tiathomu ti endliwa hi rivoni leri vangamaka, leri ri endlaka leswaku yi humesa fothoni ya rivoni, naswona rivoni hi muxaka wa nyawuso."" This translates to: ""Scientists call this phenomenon ""spontaneous emission"" because atoms are emitted by a strongly polarized light, which causes the emission of photons from the atom, and the light itself is emitted in a spontaneous manner.""

Option B directly reflects this statement about atoms being emitted by strongly polarized light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku humesa matimba lama engetelekeke (Emitting intangible energy):** While photons *carry* energy, the passage focuses on *how* the atoms emit them, not just the energy itself.
* **C: Mpimo wa matimba lowu cinca-cincaka (Fluctuating energy field):**  The passage doesn't mention fluctuating energy fields as the cause of photon emission.
* **D: Vuyelo lebyi nga riki byinene eka nyanyuso (Unexplainable phenomena in nature):** The passage *explains* the phenomenon (spontaneous emission) based on the interaction of atoms and light.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eku heteleleni loku nga ta vanga leswaku rivoni ri tshika ku tirha?","The correct answer is **B: Loko ndhawu ya nsimbi eka rivoni yi ri endzeni ka sokhethi hi xiphemu.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Endzhaku ka nkarhi ya tshwa naswona rivoni ri tshika ku tirha. I swa nkoka ngopfu leswaku u tivonela loko u cinca rivoni. Xo sungula, swichi ya rivoni yi fanele yi timiwa kumbe ntambhu yi susiwa. Leswi swi endliwa hikuva gezi leri fambaka eka sokhete laha xiphemu xa rivoni xa nsimbi xi tshamaka kona xi nga ku chowuka ngopfu loko u khoma le ndzeni ya sokhete kumbe ndhawu ya nsimbi eka rivoni loko xiphemu xa yona xi ri karhi xi ri endzeni.""

This translates to: ""It shuts down and the printer stops working. It is very important to troubleshoot when you replace a printer. To start, the printer switch should be off or the power cord unplugged. This is done because the moving belt in the printer's core can get stuck and become loose when you move inside the carriage or the paper path in the printer when the core is right inside.""

Therefore, the passage directly links the printer stopping to the belt getting stuck *when the core is right inside the paper path*. Option B accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rivoni a ri timiwi hi ndlela ya kahle** - While turning the printer off is a troubleshooting step, the passage doesn't say the printer wasn't turned off properly.
*   **C: Filamenti leyi nga le ndzeni ka rivoni ya tshwa** - The passage mentions the *belt* getting stuck, not the filament.
*   **D: Gezi leri fambaka eka sokhete ra hunguteka** - The passage states the belt can get stuck, not that the carriage itself is broken.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi ku nga endlekaka leswaku swi va ni khombo ku swi khoma loko u cinca rivoni?,"The correct answer is **A: Filamenti**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Endzhaku ka nkarhi ya tshwa naswona rivoni ri tshika ku tirha. Endzhaku ka sweswo, rivoni ri lava ku cinciwa. I swa nkoka ngopfu leswaku u tivonela loko u cinca rivoni.

This passage explains that the filament is the reason the printer stops working and needs to be replaced. The filament gets stuck inside the printer's nozzle, causing the printer to malfunction. The other options (switch, power supply, and printer door) are mentioned as things to do *before* replacing the filament, but they aren't the *cause* of the malfunction.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku endleka yini loko ku hambanisiwa nyutliliya?","The correct answer is **B: Ku humesiwa matimba**.

Here's why:

The question describes nuclear fission, where a heavy nucleus splits into lighter nuclei. This process *releases* a tremendous amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the resulting fragments (lighter nuclei and neutrons) and gamma rays.  This energy release is what is meant by ""ku humesiwa matimba"" (energy is released).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku kumiwa ka ti phurothoni (Protons are created):** While neutrons are released, protons are not directly created in the fission process itself.
* **C: Ti athomu ti sungula ku nga tiyi (Atoms stop emitting):**  Fission *releases* atoms and energy, it doesn't stop them.
* **D: Ti nyutironi ta lahleka (Neutrons are lost):** Neutrons are *released* during fission, they are not lost.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi kombaka ku fonela munhu wa le kule laha Misaveni,"The correct answer is **B: Tisethalayiti (Satellites)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that a satellite is used to communicate with someone far away, spanning thousands of miles.
* The satellite ""reflects"" signals back to Earth, which is how the communication works.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tithelesikopi (Telescopes):** Telescopes are used for *observing* things in space, but they don't directly facilitate communication over long distances. While telescopes *can* be placed on rockets, the passage focuses on the satellite for communication.
* **C: Mavoni (Views):** Views are what you *see* with a telescope or satellite, not what enable the communication itself.
* **D: Tirhoketi (Rockets):** Rockets are used to *launch* satellites and telescopes into space, but they don't directly enable the communication process. The satellite is the key to the communication.



"
I yini eka leswi swa ku tirhiseriwa ku veka thelesikopi le mpfhukeni?,"The correct answer is **C: Atimosifiye ya Misava**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Va n’wasayense va tirhisa tithelesikopi le mpfhukeni hikuva atimosifiye ya Misava yi kavanyeta rivoni na ku vona kun’wana ka hina.""  This translates to: ""Scientists used telescopes on the rocket because the atmosphere of Earth obscured the view and prevented us from seeing other things.""

The purpose of putting the telescope on the rocket was to overcome the limitations of Earth's atmosphere.
"
I yini lexi faneleke xi xiyiwa hi xiendlakalo lexi fambaka bya xirhendzevutani leswaku u fungha ndlela leyi nkarhi wu fambaka ha yona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku phindha-phindha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xiendlakalo lexi fambaka bya xirhendzevutani i xilo lexi endlekaka hi ku phindha phindha minkarhi hinkwayo."" This translates to: ""The phenomenon of recurrence occurs through repeating times.""  The question asks what should be noted about this recurrence to understand how time flows. Therefore, ""ku phindha-phindha"" (repetition) is the key element to focus on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku leha** (To be in a state/condition): While recurrence *can* be in a state, it's not the defining characteristic that helps us understand time.
* **C: Ku khumba** (To confuse/perplex):  Recurrence doesn't inherently confuse. It's a regular occurrence.
* **D: Ku tika** (To be correct/accurate): Recurrence doesn't relate to accuracy.

Therefore, **B: Ku phindha-phindha** is the most accurate answer.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiphemu xihi xa xiendlakalo lexi nkarhi u tirhiseriwaka ku swi ringanisa?","The correct answer is **B: Ku phindha-phindha**.

The passage states: ""Nkarhi wu tlhela wu va ndlela leyi hi ringanisaka ha yona ku leha ka swiendlakalo. U nga fungha ndlela leyi nkarhi wu fambaka ha yona hi ku langutisa ku vuyelelana ka xiendlakalo lexi fambaka bya xirhendzevutani. **Xiendlakalo lexi fambaka bya xirhendzevutani i xilo lexi endlekaka hi ku phindha phindha minkarhi hinkwayo.**""

This directly translates to: ""Time always serves as a way to measure phenomena. You can understand how time progresses by analyzing the correlation with fluctuating phenomena. **Fluctuating phenomena are things that occur through the repeated change of time.**""

Therefore, the answer is **Ku phindha-phindha** (repeated change/fluctuation).

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tekiwaka tanihi lexi tolovelekeke hi mudyandzhaka wa xiluvelo?","The correct answer is **A: Ku kuma digri ya 2:2**.

Here's why:

The question asks what happened *next* in the life of Charles, according to the text. The text states he initially studied Development Studies and Theology at Trinity College, Cambridge, but later obtained a 2:2 in **Theology**.  The other options describe events that happened earlier, not what followed the initial information about his studies.
"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, Charles a ku ri wa masungulo wa ku endla yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku ya evusocheni a nga si heta xikolo** (Going to university without finishing school).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hambiswiritano, Charles u ye a yunivhesithi leyi nge Trinity College, eCambridge laha a dyondzeleke kona dyondzo ya Ndhavuko wa Vanhu ni Vuyimburi, kambe endzhaku ka sweswo dyondzo ya Matimu, a kuma 2:2 (digri ya ntlawa wa vumbhirhi wa le hansi) Charles a ku ri xirho xo sungula xa Ndyangu wa le Vuhosini le Britain xo nyikiwa digri.""

This translates to: ""Furthermore, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied Human Development and Theology, but later studied Mathematics, achieving a 2:2 (lower second class degree). Charles's achievement was the start of the British Royal Society being awarded a degree.""

The question asks what Charles was the founder of. The text directly states that Charles' achievement was the beginning of the British Royal Society being awarded a degree.  The phrase ""Ku ya evusocheni a nga si heta xikolo"" refers to going to university without finishing school, which aligns with the information provided about Charles's academic path (studying Theology then Mathematics). The fact that he was awarded a degree was the *result* of his work, not what he founded.
"
I tiko rihi laha nxaxamelo wa swikepe wa Trygvasson a wu huma kona?,"The correct answer is **B: E Denmark**.

The text states: ""Hambiswiritano hi 991 Ethelred u langutane ni nxaxamelo wa swikepe wa maViking lowu a wu ri wukulu ku tlula wihi ni wihi ku sukela wa Guthrum eka malembexidzana ya le mahlweni.""  This translates to ""In 991, Ethelred made a treaty with the large Viking fleet led by Tryggvason, coming from the lands between the eastern and western kingdoms.""  The context indicates the fleet was *coming from* the area that includes Denmark. While the treaty took place in England, the fleet originated from Denmark.
"
Hi le ka nkarhi wihi eka matimu laha Jarimani a yi ri ni nkucetelo wa ndhavuko lowukulu eka Estonia?,"The answer is **C: Kwalomu ka malembe ya 600 lama hundzeke**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Estonia ya le n’walungu a yi ri ehansi ka nkucetelo wa ndhavuko lowukulu wa Jarimani."" (Estonia was under the influence of a major German trend).  It then goes on to say this started with the beginning of a new era. Given the historical context, this refers to the period of German influence starting roughly 600 years ago. The text also mentions the German letter ""Õ/õ"" being added later, further suggesting a longer-term influence. While the exact start date isn't precisely given, 600 years is the closest and most logical estimate based on the information provided.
"
Ririmi ra Estonia ri kuceteriwe hi yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Letere ra Õ/õ**.

The passage states: ""Hi sekeriwe eka letere ra Xijarimani naswona letere rin’we ra """"Õ/õ"""" ri engeteriwile."" which translates to ""It was decided on the German letter as well as another letter """"Õ/õ"""" was included."" This indicates the letter Õ/õ was added to the Estonian language.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, nhlayo ya vanhu lava vulavulaka Xihindi yi cinca-cinca hi ku ya hi xivangelo xihi?","The correct answer is **A: Loko swindzimana leswi yelanaka ni Xihindi swi hlayiwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nhlayo ya vavulavuri va kwalaho yi hambana ku titshege hi leswaku ku hlayiwa swindzimana leswi yelanaka swinene kumbe e-e."" This translates to: ""The accuracy of speakers varies depending on how closely related the languages are.""  This directly links the accuracy of understanding to the relationship between languages.  Option A reflects this relationship.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B:** The passage compares Hindi and Urdu, not Urdu to other languages.
* **C:** The passage talks about speakers understanding, not about speakers being analyzed.
* **D:** The passage doesn't mention people studying the language.



"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ntiyiso mayelana ni tindzimi ta Xihindi na Xiurdu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku va ni ku nga twisisani exikarhi ka vavulavuri va tindzimi teto timbirhi.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Emabulweni ya siku ni siku, vavulavuri va tindzimi leti hi vumbirhi hi ntolovelo va swi kota ku twisisana."" (In daily life, speakers of these two languages can usually understand each other.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A ti fani hi matsalelo** - The passage says they *differ* in pronunciation.
* **C: Ti fana havumbirhi hi marito ni matsalelo** - The passage states they are similar in vocabulary but *differ* in pronunciation.
* **D: A ti fani hi marito** - While there's vocabulary overlap, the passage doesn't say they are the *same* in vocabulary.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki ntiyiso hi letere ra Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **B: Vito ra letere ra le masungulweni a ku ri Hunam Jeongeum.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Eku sunguleni u thye letere ra Hangeul vito leri nge Hunmin Jeongeum..."" which translates to ""At the beginning, the letter of Hangeul was called Hunmin Jeongeum...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ri endliwe emasungulweni ya ku fuma ka Hosi Sejong** (It was created during the reign of King Sejong) - While true, this is not *what* the name of the letter was.
* **C: Ri endliwe hi hosi ya vumune ya Ntlhandlamano wa Tihosi wa Joseon** (It was created by a wise king of the Joseon Dynasty) - True, but again, not *what* the name of the letter was.
* **D: Ri endliwe hi vomu** (It was created by chance) - This is the opposite of the passage, which describes it as a deliberate and thoughtful creation.



"
Letere ra Hunmin Jeongeum eku heteleleni ri cinciwile ri va yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

Here's why:

* The question states that Hangeul is the alphabet created by King Sejong.
* The text mentions that the original name for Hangeul was Hunmin Jeongeum.
* Over time, Hunmin Jeongeum was eventually referred to as Hangeul, which is the name we use today.

Therefore, the letter/system evolved from Hunmin Jeongeum to Hangeul.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i tindzimi tihi leti nga kuceteriwa hi Xisanskrit?","The correct answer is **C: Tindzimi ta khale (Ancient Languages)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Sanskrit is an ancient language (""Xisanskrit i ririmi ra khale"").
* It compares Sanskrit to Latin, another ancient language of Europe.
* It mentions that Sanskrit was the language of early civilizations.
* While Sanskrit influenced many languages (including those in India), the question asks which *languages* are categorized by Sanskrit.  ""Ancient languages"" is the broader category.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Tindzimi ta Xilatin (Latin Languages):** While Sanskrit and Latin are compared, Latin languages are a specific branch of a language family. Sanskrit isn't *part* of the Latin language family, though they share similarities.
* **B: Tindzimi ta le Yuropa (European Languages):**  While Sanskrit has connections to European languages through Latin, it's not a European language itself.  It originated in India.
* **D: Tindzimi ta le Indiya (Indian Languages):** Sanskrit is *a* language of India, but not *all* Indian languages. The question asks what languages are categorized *by* Sanskrit, and ""ancient languages"" is a more accurate overarching category.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku tirhisiwa ka Xisanskrit ku pfe ku nyamalala hikwalaho ka yini?","The correct answer is **D: Ntlawa wa valawuri**.

The text explicitly states: ""Endzhaku ka ku hlengeletiwa ka Vaupanishad, Xisanskrit xo pfa xi nyamalala hikwalaho ka ntlawa wa valawuri."" This translates to ""After the interpretation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit began to decline due to the wisdom of the sages.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi kongomeke malunghana ni nkoka-misava wa lo?","The correct answer is **D: Nkoka-misava wa Misava u nga ku koka ngopfu ku tlula nkoka-misava wa lo**.

Here's why:

The question describes a scenario where a person's weight changes significantly between being on a scale and being on a platform. This implies that the platform measures something different than the scale, likely including the weight of the platform itself and potentially other factors.  

The first sentence in the question states that the platform measures a significant difference in weight between the person and the platform.  Therefore, the platform (Nkoka-misava wa Misava) will measure a heavier weight than the scale (nkoka-misava wa lo).



Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nkoka-misava wa Misava u nga ku koka katsongo ku tlula nkoka-misava wa lo:** While it's *possible* the platform could measure more, the first sentence implies the difference is substantial and not just a slight variation.
*   **B: Nkoka-misava wa lo u koka ngopfu, hikwalaho u nga ta tika katsongo:** This is illogical. The question is about the *platform* measuring more weight, not the person.
*   **C: Nkoka-misava wa lo u koka ngopfu, hikwalaho u nga ta tika ngopfu:** Same reasoning as B. It's about the platform, not the person.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma leyara ya le handle ya N’weti?","The correct answer is **A: Etlhelo ra le kusuhi khirasiti yi bumbule**.

Here's why:

The question asks what happened *as a result* of the handle of the N'weti being broken. The passage states: ""Etlhelo ra le kusuhi khirasiti yi bumbule"" which translates to ""At the beginning of the dryness, Christianity flooded."" This directly links the breaking of the handle to the flooding of Christianity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Khirasiti yi lari eka tindhawu leti tlakukeke:** While the passage mentions Christianity flooded in paved areas, this isn't presented as a *result* of the handle breaking; it's a detail about the flooding itself.
* **C: Ku nga ha va ni swigodhi leswitsongo etlhelo ra le kusuhi:** The passage states there *might not* be old dams at the beginning of the dryness *because* Christianity flooded. The handle breaking is the cause of the flooding, not the reason for the potential lack of old dams.
* **D: Ku nga ha va ni swigodhi leswitsongo eka tindhawu leti tlakukeke:**  This is similar to C, focusing on the *location* of dams rather than a direct consequence of the handle breaking.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer because it directly states what happened as a result of the broken handle – the flooding of Christianity.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, khirasiti ya N’weti yi bubumele ngopfu kwihi?","The correct answer is **C: Ehansi ka tindhawu leti tlakukeke**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ku nga ha va ni swigodhi swo tala etlhelo ra le kusuhi hikuva khirasiti yi larile. A swi olova leswaku mukhapu wa vholikheno wu humela ehansi."" (There may not be any early shrines at the beginning of the dry area because the Christians settled there. It is said that the community of believers moved down.) This clearly indicates that the Christians settled *down* in areas that were paved (tlakukeke).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Etlhelo ra le kusuhi (Beginning of the dry area):** While they *eventually* settled there, the passage says there might not have been shrines *at the beginning*.
* **B: Laha ku nga ni swigodhi swo tala (Where there are no early shrines):** This is partially true, but it doesn't specify *where* they settled.
* **D: Ehansi ka swigodhi (At the foot of shrines):** The passage suggests they moved *down* from potentially earlier locations, not settled *at* shrines.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi tshembiwaka hi vanhu vo karhi?","The correct answer is **A: Vanhu va ye eka tinyeleti tin’wana**.

Here's why:

The passage describes people going to other galaxies and hoping to find life or other planets. The question asks what happened to people *after* they were hoping this. The passage states that ""Vanhu va ye eka tinyeleti tin’wana"" (People went to other galaxies). This is the direct consequence mentioned in the passage.

The other options are related facts mentioned in the passage, but they don't describe what happened *after* the initial hope and journey.
"
I yini leswi nga lala loku u ya kule na xikarhi xa dyambu?,"The correct answer is **C: Gasi**.

The text states: ""Dyambu hinkwaro ri endliwe yi tigasi, ndzilo na plasma. Gasi yi va yo lala loko u ya kule na xikarhi xa dyambu.""  This translates to: ""The sun is made of gas, plasma, and magnetic fields. Gas cools down when you get to the center of the sun.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiphemu xihi xa dyambu lexi nga vonakala ku suka eka Misava?","The correct answer is **C: Photosphere**.

The passage states: ""Xiphemu xa le handle lexi hi xi vonaka loko hi languta dyambu xi vitaniwa photosphere, leyi vulaka “bolo ya rivoningo”.""  This directly translates to ""The surface of the thing we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which is called the 'surface of the sun'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khiurasiti (Chromosphere):** The passage doesn't mention the chromosphere.
*   **B: Plasma:** While plasma is a component of the sun's layers, the passage specifies the *surface* we see.
*   **D: Xikarhi (Core):** The core is the innermost part of the sun and not visible.



"
I ku voniwa ka yini loku nga pfuneta ku tiyisisa dyondzo ya Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Swiyenge swa Venus (The phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **Galileo's observation of Venus's phases** was a key piece of evidence supporting Copernicus's heliocentric model (which places the Sun at the center of the solar system).  The phases of Venus (like the Moon) could only be explained if Venus orbited the Sun, and not the Earth.  This was a direct contradiction to the geocentric model (Earth at the center).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ku suka ka Venus (Venus transit)** While the transit of Venus is an important astronomical event, it doesn't directly prove the heliocentric model.
* **C: Ku fana ka Dyambu na Venus (Similarity of Venus and Mercury's orbits)** While the orbits of Venus and Mercury are similar, this wasn't the primary evidence.
* **D: Ku fana ka Dyambu na N’weti (Similarity of Earth and Mars)** This isn't directly mentioned in the passage and isn't the most significant evidence for the heliocentric model in this context.



Therefore, **swiyenge swa Venus (the phases of Venus)** is the most accurate and direct answer to the question."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga voniwa hi Galileo Galilei hi 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Swiyenge swa Venus**.

The passage explicitly states that Galileo observed ""swiyenge swa Venus"" (the phases of Venus) in 1610. The other options are either incorrect or describe later observations by other astronomers.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Nambu wa Amazon wu hlengeleta mati ya wona kwihi?","The correct answer is **A: Milambu leyitsongo (Tributaries)**.

The text states: ""Yi teka mati eka minkova leyi ntsongo yo tala"" which translates to ""It takes water from the smallest rivers"".  This means the Amazon River gets its water from its tributaries.
"
I ku dzunisiwa kwihi loku nga nyikiwiki Nambu wa Amazon?,"The correct answer is **A: I nambu wa vumbirhi lowukulu swinene** (The second largest river).

The text explicitly states: ""Nkova wa Amazon i wa vumbirhi hi ku leha ni hi ku kula misava hinkwayo."" which translates to ""The Amazon River is the second largest river in terms of volume of water it carries.""
"
I ntirho wihi lowi nga vuriwa eka ndzimana lowu nga qacha nhlayo leyitsongo ya vanhu va le Venezuela?,"The correct answer is **A: Vurimi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kwalomu ka kotara yi tirha a tifemeni kambe n’we-xa-vuntlhanu wu tirha eka vurimi."" This translates to ""...about a quarter work in commerce, and about fifteen percent work in agriculture."" Since the question asks for the *least* significant employment sector, and 15% is the smallest percentage listed amongst the options, then agriculture is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tifemeni (Commerce):**  The passage states a quarter of Venezuelans work in commerce (25%).
* **C: Oyili (Oil):** The passage mentions oil is a significant part of the Venezuelan economy, but only 1% of the population works in the oil industry. While significant economically, it's not the *least* significant employment sector.
* **D: Ntirho (Employment/Work):** This is too broad. The question asks for a specific sector.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mintirho yihi eka leyi landzelaka leyi nga qacha nhlayo leyikulu ya vanhu va le Venezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Ntirho (Employment)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a significant portion of Venezuelans are employed, but a *large portion* (implied to be a problem) are in *low-skilled jobs*. The question asks what *comes next* as a major problem stemming from this. The passage explicitly mentions that Venezuela's economy relies heavily on oil, and the decline in oil production has severely impacted employment.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Vurimi (Agriculture):** While agriculture is mentioned as a sector with a certain percentage of workers, the passage doesn't highlight it as a primary *problem* currently.
* **C: Tifemeni (Commerce):** Similar to agriculture, commerce is mentioned but not presented as the dominant issue.
* **D: Oyili (Oil):** Oil is the *source* of Venezuela's economic problems, but the question asks about the *consequence* of the employment situation. The consequence is widespread unemployment and underemployment.

Therefore, the decline in *Ntirho* (employment) is the most direct and significant problem resulting from the situation described in the passage.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku hlanganisiwa ku pfumelela tinyeleti leswaku ti endla yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ti endla ti elemente to tika**.

The first paragraph states that nuclear fusion is the process where hydrogen atoms (or other things) combine to *create heavier elements*. Option A accurately reflects this. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi xitirhiswa xa ku hlanganisiwa xi nga swi vumbaka?,"The correct answer is **B: Tinyeleti**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that tinyeleti (scientists) are working on creating devices to harness the energy released when hydrogen atoms are combined (or otherwise made to react) to form elements.
* The question asks what *causes* the reaction in these devices.
* The passage implies that the reaction is initiated or driven by the action of tinyeleti.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hayidirojene (Hydrogen):** Hydrogen is one of the elements involved in the reaction, but it's not the *cause* of the reaction itself. It's a reactant.
* **C: Tiathomu (Atoms):**  Atoms are the building blocks, but the question asks what causes the *reaction* of the atoms.
* **D: Matimba (Energy):** Energy is the *result* of the reaction, not the cause.

Therefore, the most logical answer based on the passage is that the activity of the scientists (tinyeleti) is what leads to the reaction.
"
I tikhemikhali tihi leti nga endla mati?,"The correct answer is **B: Athomu yin’we ya hayidirojini na athomu yin’we ya okisijini**.

The passage states: ""Khomphawundi ya mati yi endliwe hi ti athomu timbirhi ta hayidirojini na athomu yin’we ya okisijini.""  This translates to ""Water compound is made of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.""
"
"Loko mati ma cinca xivumbeko, i yini lexi nga ta sala xi nga cincanga?","The correct answer is **A: Xivumbeko xa molekhuli**.

Here's why:

The passage states that even when water changes state (solid, liquid, gas), the *molecular composition* remains the same. It's still made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H₂O).  Only the arrangement and movement of these molecules change, which affects the overall state of matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ntiko:** The amount of nitrogen is irrelevant to the change of state of water. The passage specifically says water is nitrogen-free.
*   **C: Xivumbeko xa le handle:** The ""handle"" refers to the overall arrangement of molecules, not a fixed property that remains unchanged.
*   **D: Nayitirojeni ya xihalaki:**  Again, nitrogen is not a component of water and doesn't stay constant during phase changes.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi a ku nga ri xiphiqo eka matiko ya khume nharhu loko ma tingeta ku veka milawu?","The correct answer is **A: Ku lawuriwa ngopfu hi valawuri va mfumo (Increased influence of lobbyists)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Church has influence due to its ability to manipulate statistics and lack of accountability.  It also mentions that the government needs consistent success from the Church, which prevents the Church from being challenged. This creates an environment where lobbyists (valawuri va mfumo) have a lot of influence. They can work behind the scenes and shape laws to benefit the Church.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku nga vi ni matimba endzeni ka Vandla ra Tiko (The Church lacks internal power):** The passage explicitly says the Church *does* have power, specifically through manipulation and lack of accountability.
* **C: Ku lulamisiwa a ku lava mpfumelelo lowu ku pfumaleleneke (Consistent success is achieved and is necessary):** While the passage mentions the government *needs* success, it's the *Church's* manipulation that *creates* this success, not the other way around. The consistent success is a result of the Church's actions, not a pre-existing condition.
* **D: Rhavi ra hulummhe leri nga riki kona (Lack of government accountability):** The passage actually says the *Church's* lack of accountability is a factor in its power, not the other way around.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the passage's content.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi kombisaka hi ku kongoma xiyimo xa hulumendhe hi nkarhi wa Nyimpi ya Mafumelo Lamantshwa?","The correct answer is **C: Vayimeri va mfumo a va tshama va nga ri kona.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ntwanano u lava mpfumelelo lowu ku pfumaleleneke ku suka eka matiko hinkwawo wu nga si lulamisiwa naswona matiko ma tekele hansi mfumo lowu nga le xikarhi hi laha vayimeri va wona a va tshama hakanyingi va nga ri kona.""

This directly translates to: ""The covenant requires successful implementation originating from the military where the military does not adhere to the covenant and the military is constantly moving around so that their soldiers are not always present.""

This indicates that the *absence* or *lack of presence* of military personnel was a significant factor contributing to the breakdown of government stability during the successful period of the Nyimpi ya Mafumelo Lamantshwa.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Swibalo swi sindzisiwe hi Vandla ra Tlogo ni valawuri va mfumo** (Figures were manipulated by the Tlogo Party and military leaders): While the passage mentions manipulation of figures, it's not the primary reason for the government's instability. Manipulation is a tactic, not the root cause.
* **B: Ku lulamisiwa ka Mintwanano a ku titshege hi vulawuri bya Vandla ra Tlogo** (The covenant was implemented based on the laws of the Tlogo Party): The passage implies the covenant *wasn't* fully implemented effectively, despite being based on Tlogo laws. The lack of adherence and movement of personnel undermined the implementation.
* **D: Hulumendhe a yi ri ni swiaki swimbirhi** (The government had two leaders): The passage does not mention the government having two leaders. The instability stemmed from the issues within the military and the implementation of the covenant.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of the passage's main point about the instability of the government during that period.



"
Marito lama nga endzhaku ka Xihlambanyo xa Ntshunxeko ma tsariwe njhani?,"The correct answer is **C: Ma ganamile**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tsalwa leri ri vonakala ehansi ka papila, ri ganamile."" which translates to ""The writing that appears on the paper is faded."" Therefore, the historical documents from the Declaration of Independence were faded.
"
Singapore yi tiviwa ngopfu hi yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Doroba ya rihlaza (Green City)**.

Here's why:

The question states that the Singapore Botanic Gardens aimed to preserve the city's ""green city"" image. The fact that Vanda Miss Joaquim was identified as a national flower and the Gardens wanted to continue showcasing its beauty implies a focus on maintaining and promoting Singapore's reputation as a green city.

The other options are not directly linked to the provided text:

*   **B: Ku khandziya tintshava (Waste disposal):** While important for a city, it's not the central theme here.
*   **C: Mintlangu ya le handle (Local language):** Not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Vutshila (Orchids):** While orchids are mentioned, the core concern is preserving the image of a green city.

Therefore, ""Doroba ya rihlaza"" is the best fit, representing Singapore's desired image and the reason for preserving the national flower."
I yini Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **A: Xihlala (Flower)**.

The text states that Vanda Miss Joaquim is an orchid, and orchids are flowers. The text also says it was considered the national flower of Singapore.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xiyimo xihi xa xihondzo ta le Giza lexi a xi nga ta va lexi hlamarisaka eka Vafumi lavantshwa va Vaegipta?","The correct answer is **A: Malembe ya xona (Its age)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the pharaohs were amazed by the *age* of the Giza pyramids, considering them to be very old, sometimes dating back tens of thousands of years. The passage explicitly links the pyramids' immense age to the pharaohs' awe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku tirhisiwa ka ribye (Its construction using ramps):** While the construction methods are fascinating, the passage doesn't explicitly state that the construction method itself was the source of the pharaohs' awe.
*   **C: Vukulu bya xona (Its size):** The passage mentions the size, but the emphasis is more on the sheer *age* being remarkable.
*   **D: Ku endliwa ka xona (Its creation):** This is too general. While the creation is significant, the *age* of the creation is what specifically impressed the pharaohs.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, swihari leswi dyaka swimilana ntsena swi suka kwihi ku ya lava mpfula?","The correct answer is **C: A switsungeni swa le n’walungwini**.

The passage states: ""P: Lembe na lembe hi October kwalomu ka timiliyoni ta 1.5 leti dyaka swimilana swa famba swi kongoma timbala-ntshava ta le dzongeni, ti pela Nambu wa Mara ku suka a **switsungeni swa le n’walungwini** leswaku ti kuma mpfula.""

This translates to: ""Every year in October, millions of wildebeest migrate from the plains, crossing the Mara River in search of grazing, starting from the **highlands** to drink water.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, hi le ka ndhawu yihi laha swihari leswi dyaka swimilana swi sukaka kwalomu ka April?","The correct answer is **A: Xifundzha xa Serengeti**.

The passage states: ""Hi April, ti tlhelela endzhaku a n’walungwini ku ya evupela-dyambu, ti tlhela ti pela Nambu wa Mara, endzhaku ka mpfula hi April. Xifundzha xa Serengeti xi katsa ePhakeni ya Tiko ya Serengeti, Ndhawu leyi Sirheleriweke ya Ngorongoro ni Ntanga wa Swihari wa Maswa eTanzania ni Ntanga wa leswi nga Sirheleriwa eKenya.""

This means the wildebeest migrate to the Serengeti after crossing the Mara River in April. Therefore, the Serengeti is where they are found based on the information provided.
"
Vutirheli bya Sealion a ku ri ku hlaseriwa ka tiko rihi?,"The correct answer is **B: E Britain**.

The passage states: ""Jarimani yi sungule ku ti lunghiselela ku hlasela xihlala xa Britain."" (Germany began preparing to attack the shores of Britain.) This directly indicates that Operation Sealion was a planned invasion of Britain.
"
Jarimani yi ku vitane yini ku hlaseriwa ka Britain?,"The correct answer is **B: Vutirheli bya Sealion**.

The passage states: ""Jarimani yi sungule ku ti lunghiselela ku hlasela xihlala xa Britain. Jarimani yi thye nhlaselo lowu yi vito ra khodi leri nge “Vutirheli bya Sealion”.""  This translates to: ""Germany began preparing to attack the British mainland. Germany chose this operation, code-named 'Sealion'.""
"
I yini leyi nga vuriwiki tanihi goza ra nkoka eka kungu ra Italiya ra ku teka matiko ya le Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: A va ta lava ndhawu ya ku humesa mavuthu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku teka matiko wolawo, a va ta lava ndhawu ya ku humesa mavuthu, leswaku mavuthu a kota ku tluta a tsemakanye Lwandle ra Mediteraniya ni ku hlasela Afrika.""  (To carry out these ambitions, they needed a base to move troops, so that troops could sail along the Mediterranean Sea and attack Africa.)

The other options are related to Italy's ambitions but not the *primary* reason they needed to take African territories:

*   **A: Ku susa swikepe swa le Egipta** (Seizing ships in Egypt) - This was a tactic, but not the fundamental driver.
*   **B: Ku aka swikepe leswi engetelekeke** (Establishing independent fleets) - The passage doesn't mention this.
*   **D: Ku herisa tintsindza ta masocha ya le Britain** (Transferring troops from Britain) - While relevant to their overall strategy, it doesn't explain *why* they needed African territories in the first place.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini lexi a xi tekiwa tanihi xikongomelo-nkulu xa Italiya hi nyimpi?","The correct answer is **A: Ku teka matiko ya le Afrika**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Xikongomelo lexikulu xa Italiya a ku ri matiko ya le Afrika."" (The main goal of Italy was the African colonies.) The other options are related to Italian military actions but not the *main goal* of their military strategy.
"
I mani la nga endla xinghana ni vahlaseri?,"The correct answer is **B: Mafurwa ya le Vichy**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lava a ku ri vanhu va Mafurwa lava a va endle ku rhula na Majarimani hi 1940 naswona va tirhe na lava hlaselaka ematshan’weni yo lwa na vona."" This translates to ""People of the Vichy government who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 also worked with the attackers on the other side.""  The attackers are described as those who attacked Furwa.  Therefore, the Vichy French were working with the attackers.

While the Germans were the overall enemy, the passage specifically mentions the Vichy French collaborating with the attackers. The Americans and Allied forces are described as *later* attacking and liberating Furwa, not initially involved in the attacks themselves.



"
I va mani lava a va katseka eka Vutirheli bya Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Maamerika ni Mafurwa lama nga Ntshunxeka**

The text states: ""Hi ti 15 August 1940, ti Allies ti hlasele edzongeni wa Furwa, nhlaselo u vitaniwe “Vutirheli bya Dragoon” Hi mavhiki mambirhi ntsena Maamerika ni mavuthu ya Mafurwa lama nga Ntshunxeka va ntshunxe edzongeni wa Furwa naswona va va kongome eka Jarimani."" This directly translates to ""On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked the Furwa depot, an operation called 'Dragoon's Raid'. For two weeks, Americans and Free French forces attacked the Furwa depot and then advanced into Germany.""
"
I ku hluvuka ka thekinoloji yihi loku nga vangela leswaku swikepe swa le hansi ka mati swi sungula ku famba ehansi ka mati?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

The text explicitly states: ""Loko nyimpi yi sungula hi xitalo a swi famba ehenhla ka lwandle, kambe loko radar yi sungula ku hluvuka naswona yi kongoma ngopfu swikepe swa le hansi ka mati swi boheke ku nghena ehansi ka mati ku papalata ku voniwa.""  This translates to: ""When a navy starts initially sailing on the surface of the water, but when radar starts to work, it greatly alarms submarines, causing them to dive underwater to avoid being seen.""

Therefore, the development and use of **radar** was the technology that caused submarines to begin diving.
"
"Hi nkarhi wa ku swi tirhisa ra ku sungula, swikepe swa le hansi ka mati a swi ri ni swipimelo swa vukule eka xiphemu xihi?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tluta (To dive)**.

The text states: ""Loko nyimpi yi sungula hi xitalo a swi famba ehenhla ka lwandle, kambe loko radar yi sungula ku hluvuka naswona yi kongoma ngopfu swikepe swa le hansi ka mati swi boheke ku nghena ehansi ka mati ku papalata ku voniwa."" This translates to: ""When the navy starts, they sail on the surface of the sea, but when the radar starts to work, it greatly alerts submarines to dive underwater to avoid being seen."" 

Therefore, the primary action submarines performed when initially used was **diving**.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani la nga lwisana ni ntwanano? ","The correct answer is **D: Va Soviet**.

The text states: ""...masocha lama tlulaka 800,000 ya Soviet’s Union Red Army ma nghena ni ku hlasela va yimisa emahlweni Belarus ni Ukraine..."" This directly indicates that the Soviet Union's Red Army was the entity engaging in conflict.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga endliwanga hi Red Army?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku hlaseriwa ka swifundzha swa le vuxeni swa Poland**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""...masocha lama tlulaka 800,000 ya Soviet’s Union Red Army ma nghena ni ku hlasela va yimisa emahlweni Belarus ni Ukraine endzhaku ka ku hlasela swifundzha swa le vuxeni swa Poland...""

This directly translates to the Red Army entering and attacking territories of Poland. Options A, C, and D describe actions that happened *as a result* of the Red Army's actions, not the initial action itself.
"
Ku endleke yini hi Munjiniyarankulu wa Vukhume wa Vuthu wa Muntariyana?,"The correct answer is **B: U dlayiwile a Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Ku nga si hela vhiki loko Italy ri tivise nyimpi hi Juni 10, 1940, ti-Hussar ta vu-11 ta maBurithani a ti vutle Fort Capuzzo le Libya. Eka nhlaselo wo tumbelela le vuxeni bya Bardia, maBurithani ma teke Munjiniyarankulu wa Vukhume wa Vuthu wa Muntariyana, Mujenerala Lastucci. **Hi June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Mulawurijenerala wa Libya tlhelo loyi a tekiwa a ri mudyandzhaka wa Mussolini, u dlayiwile hi ku baleseriwa hi xihoxo loko a fika eTobruk.**""

This clearly indicates that General Lastucci was killed in action while arriving at Tobruk.
"
Italo Balbo u dlayiwe kwihi?,"The correct answer is **D: E Tobruk**.

The text states: ""June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Mulawurijenerala wa Libya tlhelo loyi a tekiwa a ri mudyandzhaka wa Mussolini, u dlayiwile hi ku baleseriwa hi xihoxo loko a fika eTobruk.""  This translates to: ""June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, the General of Libya appointed as Mussolini's right-hand man, was attacked and wounded upon arriving in Tobruk.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i endlelo rihi eka lama landzelaka leri nga xiphemu xa nkoka eka ku anakanyisisa ka Xitibet?","The correct answer is **C: Ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Hi ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu swo hambana hambana mintila ya matimba ya basisiwa, ti chakra ti sungula ku tirha naswona ku endleka ku xalamukela ku voningeriwa.""  This directly links gazing at mandalas (mahalo ya mianakanyo) with the activation of energy centers (chakra) and the development of spiritual awareness.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ku titoloveta vutiolori byo hefumula:** While the text mentions using visual aids (vutiolori byo hefumula), it's not presented as the *most important* or foundational practice.
* **B: Ku phindha-phindha marito yo karhi ya vukhongeri:**  The text mentions mantras (marito yo karhi ya vukhongeri) but doesn't highlight repetition as the central practice.
* **D: Ku dyondza mayimelo ya yoga:**  While yoga postures (mayimelo ya yoga) are mentioned, the text focuses on the overall process of awakening consciousness, and the most prominent practice linked to that awakening is gazing at mandalas.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ti chakra ti sungula ku tirha njhani eka ntsindza wa ku anakanyisisa ka Xitibet?","The correct answer is **B: Hi ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hi ku languta hi mahlo ya mianakanyo swikwembu swo hambana hambana mintila ya matimba ya basisiwa, ti chakra ti sungula ku tirha naswona ku endleka ku xalamukela ku voningeriwa.""  (Through gazing at various deities, the fundamental energies begin to work, and the chakras begin to function, leading to the awakening of intuition.)
"
I mani loyi a nga endla vuyimbeleri bya ku tinyiketela hi nkarhi wa nongonoko?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanju Sharma**.

The passage states: ""Evusikwini lebyi ku sungule muyimbeleri Sanju Sharma..."" which translates to ""On the first day, the singer Sanju Sharma..."". This indicates that Sanju Sharma was the first singer to perform during the evening prayers.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga endla vuyimbeleri bya ku tinyiketela hi nkarhi wa ku nyiketela swakudya?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Endzhaku ka sweswo, Lakkha Singh u kongomise ku yimbelela ti-bhajan.""  This means Lakkha Singh was the one who performed the devotional songs (bhajans) after the other singers. The text also mentions he performed ""chhappan bhog bhajan"".

While the other singers performed bhajans, the specific mention of performing the ""chhappan bhog bhajan"" points directly to Lakkha Singh as the performer of the devotional songs at the time of the food offering.
"
A ku ri yini ku tlangela ka vumbirhi ku ya eka ko hetelela bya nimadyambu?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina na Haris Alexiou**.

The question asks what *pairs* of artists performed at the festival. Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou are listed as performing together, making them a pair. The other options are either single entities (Fire of Anatolia, Whirling Dervishes) or duos (Fatih Erkoç na Müslüm Gürses) but the question specifically asks about pairs.
"
Alessandro Safina i wa rixaka rihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Muntariyani**.

The text explicitly states: ""...na Alessandro Safina wa Muntariyani loyi a yimbelelaka thena..."" which translates to ""...and Alessandro Safina from Milan who sang then..."".
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **C: Vakhandziyi va nyikiwe mati.**

The text explicitly states: ""Vakhandziyi va va nyikiwe mati loko va ha yimile eka ku hisa ka 90(F)-wa tidigiri."" (The lifeguards were given water when they stood in the heat of 90(F) degrees.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ku ri ni ndzilo le Santa Clara** (There isn't a Santa Clara beach): The text mentions Santa Clara as the location of the heat, but it doesn't say there isn't a beach there.
* **B: Vanhu a va phasekeke eka roller coaster** (People were screaming on a roller coaster):  The text uses the roller coaster as an analogy to describe the intense heat, but it doesn't say people were actually on a roller coaster.
* **D: Swi teke timinete ta 60 ku hemesa munhu wun’we eka xo khandziya** (It took 60 minutes to rescue someone from drowning): The text mentions that the heat is so intense that it could cause someone to drown, but it doesn't give a rescue time.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga vulavula hi mpimo wa ku hisa lowu nga tiyiselelekiki?","The correct answer is **B: Mukaputeni wa ndzilo**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Scott Kouns, the **Mukaputeni wa ndzilo (Police Chief)**, made the statement about the dangerous heat conditions and the roller coaster incident. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mulawuri wa xo khandziya (Attorneys):** While attorneys might be involved in legal issues related to the incident, the statement was made by the police chief.
* **C: Vakhandziyi (Witnesses):** Witnesses might have seen the incident, but the statement is attributed to the police chief.
* **D: Murhangeri wa maphorisa (Police Officer):** The text specifically identifies Scott Kouns as the Police Chief, not just a police officer.
"
A ku ri kwihi laha ku nga na ku tsemeka ka gezi hikwalaho ka xiendlakalo xa tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: E Tonga**.

The text states: ""Ku hava ku onhaka kumbe ku vaviseka loku vikiweke le Tonga, kambe gezi ri tsemekile nkarhinyana..."" which translates to ""There was a tremor or a felt earthquake in Tonga, but the seismic activity was minor...""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Tonga yi khumbeke njhani hi ku tsemeka ka gezi?","The correct answer is **A: Ku na ku onhaka loku vikiweke**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ku hava ku onhaka kumbe ku vaviseka loku vikiweke le Tonga..."" which translates to ""There was a slight tremor or a reported earthquake in Tonga...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Valawuri a va kumanga mahungu malunghana ni swilemukiso leswi susiweke:** While the earthquake led to tsunami warnings, this is a consequence, not the initial feeling/observation in Tonga.
* **C: Mimpimo ya lwandle yi khumbekile:** The text mentions sea level measurements *were* affected by the tsunami, but it doesn't say the sea level *felt* like it was rising in Tonga.
* **D: Valawuri va tsandzekile ku kuma swilemukiso leswi faneleka:** The text states that the Tonga authorities were *informed* of the tsunami warning by PTWC, not that they actively sought it out.



"
Hi rini laha maphorisa ma nga kota ku tirhisa swibalesa swo pima rivilo ra timovha leswaku va kuma rivilo ra Jonny Reid ra ku chayela?,"The correct answer is **C: Loko a chayela ku tlula 160km/h**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maphorisa ya le New Zealand ma karhatekile ku tirhisa swibalesa swona swa rivilo ko pima rivilo ra Nkul Reid hikwalaho ka leswi Black Beauty a yi fambela ehansi, nkarhi wun’we ntsena laha maphorisa ma swi kotile ku pima rivilo ra Nkul Reid **loko a hunguta rivilo ri fika eka 160km/h**.""

This translates to: ""New Zealand police were keen to use their speed traps to catch Jonny Reid because the Black Beauty was going fast, once even catching Jonny Reid's speed **when it reached 160km/h**.""

Therefore, the police used speed traps *when he was driving over 160km/h*.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini a swi tikela maphorisa ya le New Zealand ku pima rivilo ra Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **C: U chayele ehenhla ka buloho minkarhi ya nkombo ntsena** (He drove above the speed limit during the race).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Maphorisa ya le New Zealand ma karhatekile ku tirhisa swibalesa swona swa rivilo ko pima rivilo ra Nkul Reid hikwalaho ka leswi Black Beauty a yi fambela ehansi, nkarhi wun’we ntsena laha maphorisa ma swi kotile ku pima rivilo ra Nkul Reid loko a hunguta rivilo ri fika eka 160km/h."" This translates to: ""New Zealand police were forced to pursue Jonny Reid because of the fact that Black Beauty was driving above the speed limit, on one occasion when the police had to pursue Reid when the speed reached 160km/h.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A chayela ehansi ka 160km/h** (He drove below 160km/h) - This contradicts the text.
*   **B: Movha a yi ri ehansi ngopfu** (The car was very low) - This is irrelevant to the police pursuit.
*   **D: The Auckland Harbour Bridge i ya khale** (The Auckland Harbour Bridge is old) - This is irrelevant to the police pursuit.



"
Ku tsekatseka ka misava ku endleke kwihi mayelana ni Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 wa timayili edzongeni**.

The text states: ""...en’walunguvu bya Dillon ni kwalomu ka 65 wa tikhilomitara (40 wa timayili) edzongeni wa Butte."" This translates to ""near Dillon and 40 miles east of Butte.""
"
I yini lexi nga humelela hi nkarhi wa hasahasa le Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku khomiwa ku biha ka vakhotsiwa** (The torture of prisoners).

The question states that the Abu Ghraib scandal unfolded gradually *because of the torture of prisoners*. The other options describe events *related to* the scandal, but not the underlying cause or the reason for the gradual unfolding.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Nsivelo wa ku huma** (The feeling of escape/evasion): While there might have been some feeling of escape for the perpetrators, this isn't the *reason* for the gradual unfolding of the scandal.
* **C: Mavuthu ya US ma lawule ndhawu** (US troops controlled the area): This is a factual detail, but not the core reason why the scandal developed over time.
* **D: Khotso ri hisiwile hi ndzilo** (Peace was lost gradually):  This is a general statement about the overall situation, but it doesn't explain *how* the scandal unfolded.



"
Ha yini jele ra Iraqi ri ve ni ndhuma? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tshuburiwa ka ku khomiwa ku biha ka vakhotsiwa**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *why* the Iraqi prison was shut down.
* The initial statement says the prison was closed *after* the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib was revealed.
* The root cause of the closure was the scandal of the abuse itself.  The other options describe events *related to* the closure (the abuse happened, the US controlled the area, it wasn't a sudden event), but not the *reason* for the closure.

Therefore, the closure was directly *caused* by the abuse of prisoners.
"
I muxaka muni wa xiendlakalo lowu a wu ta khomiwa a War Memorial Stadium xa Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Khonsati (Concert)**.

The text states the stadium was cancelled due to a concert (nkombiso).
"
I mani a ku heteleleni la nga nyikela nhlamuselo malunghana ni ku khanseriwa ka xiendlakalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Bendhe**.

The question asks who is responsible for the cancellation. The text states: ""Bendhe yi khanserile nkombiso..."" which translates to ""The team cancelled the show..."" Therefore, the team is responsible.
"
I va mani lava vaaki vo hlayanyana va le Bishkek a va va sola hi ku phangiwa ka nhundzu eswitolo?,"The correct answer is **C: Lava vakombisaka ku vilela**.

The question asks who the young residents of Bishkek blamed. The text states: ""Vaaki vo hlayanyana va le Bishkek va sola vanhu lava kombisaka ku vilela lava humaka edzongeni hikwalaho ka ku tshoviwa loku ka nawu."" This translates to: ""Young residents of Bishkek blamed the people who showed concern and moved to the park because of the stench.""
"
I mani la nga sola lava vakombisaka ku vilela lava humaka edzongeni hi ku phangiwa ka nhundzu eswitolo?,"The correct answer is **A: Vaaki va Bishkek**.

The text states: ""Vaaki vo hlayanyana va le Bishkek va sola vanhu lava kombisaka ku vilela lava humaka edzongeni hikwalaho ka ku tshoviwa loku ka nawu."" This translates to ""Residents of Bishkek blamed people who showed up at the protest because of the smell of the burning tires.""

Therefore, the residents of Bishkek are the ones who blamed those who left for the protest.
"
Ring u vone rini ku tlakuka ka minxavo?,"The correct answer is **A: Endzhaku ka loko a humelerile eka nongonoko wa Shark Tank**.

The text states: ""Minxavo yi tlakukile hi 2013 endzhaku ka loko a humelerile eka nongonoko wa Shark Tank...""
"
Jamie Siminoff o teke rini xiboho xa ku sungula Ring?,"The correct answer is **B: Endzhaku ka ku tsandzeka ku humelela eka Shark Tank**.

The text states: ""Minxavo yi tlakukile hi 2013 endzhaku ka loko a humelerile eka nongonoko wa Shark Tank laha vafambisi va nongonoko va aleke ku hakelela masungulo ya kona.""  This translates to: ""The idea was born in 2013 after he appeared on the Shark Tank show where the investors declined to fund the startup.""



Therefore, the answer is B.
"
Xiphemu xin’wana ni xin’wana xa Reading Rainbow a xi bumabumela vana yini?,"The correct answer is **D: Tibuku**.

The passage states: ""Nongonoko wun’wana ni wun’wana a wu thlela wu bumabumela tibuku tin’wana leti vana va nga ti langutaka loko va ya eka tilayiburari ta vona."" This translates to ""Each episode of Reading Rainbow always recommends other books that children can find at their local library.""
"
I yini lexi nga va xi endle leswaku ku hela ntlhandlamano wa xitori xa Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hela ntlhandlamano wa xitori xa Reading Rainbow.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Van’wana va tshemba, ku katsa na John Grant, leswaku ku hela ka minyikelo ni ku cinca eka minongonoko ya thelevhixini ya ku dyondzisa filosofi ku hoxe xandla eka ku hela ka ntlhandlamano wa xitori."" (Others hoped, along with John Grant, that the shift in philosophy in children's television would have an impact on literacy rates.)

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they are not presented as the *reason* for the increase in literacy rates. They are contributing factors or observations. The passage directly links the change in *philosophy* to the improvement in literacy.



"
I nhlamuselo yihi eka leswi landzelaka leyi nga vuriwanga hi vatirhelamfumo va Amsterdam na muziyamu malunghana ni nsinya?,"The correct answer is **D: Wu nga va ni khombo eka rihanyo ra vanhu**.

Here's why:

The question states the museum revealed the artifact *might* have been tampered with, potentially affecting the investigation into who stole it. Option D directly reflects this uncertainty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A wu ri ekhombyeni ro va wu wa:** The text says this is a *possibility*, not a certainty.
* **B: Wu fanele wu ponisiwa:** While the artifact *should* be investigated, the question asks about *what the museum revealed*, not what they recommended.
* **C: Wu hlaseriwe hi mfurhe:** This is stated as a possibility by the museum, but the question asks what the museum *revealed* as a potential consequence, which is the impact on the investigation.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndhuna ya vukamberi ya RSPCA, vukamberi byi fanele byi tirha eka yini eka leswi landzelaka?","The correct answer is **A: Ti khamera ta CCTV**.

The passage states: ""Animal Liberation na Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) va tlhela va kombela ku hoxiwa ka ti CCTV khamera eka tindhawu hinkwato leti xavisaka nyama ni ku dlaya swiharhi eAustralia."" (Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) will continue to ask for the installation of CCTV cameras in establishments that slaughter and process meat in Australia.)

Therefore, the RSPCA wants CCTV cameras installed.
"
"Hi ku hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga pfuna ku tiyisa nkoka wa vuhlayiseki bya swihari eka vatirhi va tindhawu leti xavisaka nyama ni ku dlaya swiharhi va le Australia?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tlhomiwa ka ti khamera ta CCTV**.

The text explicitly states: ""CCTV a yi ta endla leswaku vanhu lava tirhaka hi swiharhi va leswaku rihanyo ni vuhlayiseki bya swona i bya nkoka swinene."" (CCTV will ensure that the actions and behavior of those working with animals are truly accountable.)

While the other options might be related to the overall effort, the passage focuses specifically on the use of CCTV cameras as the means to achieve accountability.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini ntirho wa munhu la nga khomiwa?","The correct answer is **A: Xichudeni**.

The question asks about the identity of the person who was arrested. The text states: ""Mahungu ya leswaku xichudeni xin’wana lexi duvuriweke exikolweni hi March 21 ya hangalakile...""  ""Xichudeni"" is the word used to describe the arrested person in the passage.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, loko ka ha hangalaka mahungu hi ku khomiwa kun’wana, a ku lahliwa vanhu va ngani lava duvuriweke?","The correct answer is **B: Va nharhu**.

The text explicitly states: ""...hi March 21 ya hangalakile eka vanhu va le Red Lake namuntlha tanihi leswi ku lahliwaka Jeff Weise ni van’wana **vanharhu** lava duvuriweke.""  This translates to ""...on March 21st, the anguish erupted in Red Lake and today with the loss of Jeff Weise and other **juveniles** who were harmed.""
"
"Eka nhlamulo ya xitereko, i tiko rihi leri nga si ya emahlweni na ntwanano wa ACTA lowu nga sayiniwa?","The correct answer is **B: E Poland**.

The text explicitly states: ""Eka n’wheti leyi nga hundza, kuve na ku tereka lokukulu ePoland loko tiko leri ri sayine ACTA, leswi swi endle leswaku hulumende yale Poland yi teka xiboho xa ku nga wu sayini sweswi ntwanano."" (In the meantime, there was a large protest in Poland when the country that signed ACTA, which led the Polish government to take a position against signing these agreements.) This indicates Poland is a key country opposing the ACTA agreement.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i matiko mahi eka lama landzelaka lama nga hlawula ku teka nkarhi ku nghenelela ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: E Latvia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Latvia na Slovakia havumbirhi ti teke nkarhi ku nghenelela ACTA."" This directly indicates that Latvia did not sign or agree to the ACTA agreement, meaning they took action to prevent it.
"
I vanhu vangani lava nga vaviseka hikwalaho ka xiendlakalo xa ti iPod leti nga hisa ku tlula mpimo?,"The correct answer is **B: 27**.

The passage states: ""Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ya le Japani (METI) yi vule leswaku a va swi tiva leswaku ku na timhangu ta **27** leti vangiweke hi switirhisiwa leswi."" which translates to ""The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) announced that it found that 27 units were defective due to the malfunction.""
"
I mani la nga vula leswaku swiendlakalo swa ku hisa ku tlula mpimo i leswi-nga riki swa vutiyimiseri?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The text states: ""Apple a yi yi tivise hi 34 wa switirhisiwa leswi engetelekeke leswi a swi hisa ku tlula mpimo, leswi khamphani yi swi vuleke “leswi-nga riki swa vutiyimiseri”.""  This translates to: ""Apple has stated that 34 imported devices have failed performance tests, and the company has described these as ""unexplainable"".""
"
"Eka bulo ra yena, Steve Jobs u te Apple yi ta sungula vuntshwa yini?","The correct answer is **B: Selifoni**.

The text states: ""Namuntlha Apple yi ta sungula vuntshwa **selifoni**..."". This translates to ""Today Apple will launch **phones**..."".
"
Xikongomelo xa Steve Jobs xa bulo ra tiwara timbirhi a ku ri yini?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku kombisa selifoni leyintshwa**.

The passage states: ""Hi nkarhi wa mbulavulo wakwe wa 2 wa tiawara u vule leswaku """"Namuntlha Apple yi ta sungula vuntshwa selifoni..."""" which translates to ""At the second anniversary of his reveal, he announced that today Apple will start with the phone...""

Therefore, the reveal was about a new phone.
"
I yini leswi Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner a nga swi tivisa eka Thiyetara ya Argentina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku nghenela ku hlawuriwa ku va muungameri**.

The passage states: ""Man. Kirchner u tivisile xikongomelo xakwe xa ku yimela ku langiwa ku va muungameri eka Thiyetara ya Argentina...""  This directly translates to ""Mrs. Kirchner cancelled her commitment to host a meeting at the Argentina Theatre...""

Therefore, she cancelled the *meeting* (ku hlawuriwa ku va muungameri).
"
Hi le kwihi laha Cristina Fernandes a nga tivisa xikongomelo xa yena xa ku langiwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Eka Thiyetara ya Argentina leyi nga timayili ta 31 ku suka Buenos Aires**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Man. Kirchner u tivisile xikongomelo xakwe xa ku yimela ku langiwa ku va muungameri eka **Thiyetara ya Argentina**, ndhawu yona leyi a yi tirhiseleke ku sungula tsima rakwe ra 2005 ra Sinethara tanihi xirho xa nhlawulo wa xifundzha wa Buenos Aires.""
* It also mentions the theater is 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.

Therefore, the theater is the Teatro Argentina, located 31 miles from Buenos Aires.
"
I yini leswi nga kumiwa hi ACMA malunghana ni Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: A ku nga tshoviwanga milawu yo kambela rungula**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what ACMA can *do* to Big Brother.
* The text states that ACMA can *enforce* laws related to online broadcasting.
* Option A directly reflects this enforcement action - ACMA can enforce laws against broadcasting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vuhaxi byebyo a byi nga hlayisiwanga eka webusayiti ya Big Brother:** This is a *consequence* of ACMA's enforcement, not what ACMA *does*. It's what Big Brother might be *forced* to do.
* **C: A ku tshoviwile milawu yo kambela rungula:** This is incorrect. The text says ACMA *can* enforce the laws, not that the laws *have* been enforced in this specific case.
* **D: Rungula ri kumiwe ri tshama hi ku kongoma eka server:** This describes a technical action related to online broadcasting, but it's not what ACMA can *do*. It's a possible method of compliance, but not the action ACMA can take.



"
I swipimelo swihi leswi vuhaxi byi faneleke byi wela ehansi ka byona leswaku byi tekiwa tanihi rungula ra inthanete?,"The correct answer is **B: Byi fanele byi tshama hi ku kongoma eka server.**

Here's why:

The text states that ACMA is concerned about illegal videos online and that Big Brother might not be able to host them on their website due to internet regulations. The text further explains that the Broadcasting Complaints Commission (Vukorhokeri bya Vuhaxi) sets regulations for online content, stating that illegal content should be removed from the server.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Byi fanele byi va lebyi haxiweke eka Inthanete (They should be illegal online):** While the text mentions illegal videos, it doesn't specify that *all* videos should be illegal.
* **C: A byi fanelanga byi hlayisiwa eka webusayiti (They should not be uploaded to the website):** This is implied, but the specific action recommended by the regulations is removal from the server.
* **D: Byi fanele byi pfumeriwa hi ACMA (They should be reviewed by ACMA):**  The text says ACMA is *concerned* about illegal videos, but it doesn't say that all videos need to be reviewed by ACMA. The regulations dictate the removal of illegal content.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is that illegal content should be removed from the server."
I mani murhangeri wa Vandla ra Liberal ra le Australia?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text states: ""Peter Costello...ni teka xikhundlha xa Holobyenkulu John Howard tanihi murhangeri wa vandla ra Liberal..."" which translates to ""Peter Costello...took the position of Prime Minister John Howard as a leader of the Liberal party...""
"
Ha yini Australia yi nga si va ni vumaki bya matimba ya nyutliya?,"The correct answer is **A: A ku na nseketelo wa vaaki** (There is a lack of voter support).

Here's why:

The text states Peter Costello believes Australia *should* start using nuclear power because it's good for the economy.  He also mentions the need for a ""clear mandate"" (won a clear vote) to implement it.  This implies a lack of public support or a lack of a strong mandate from the people is the reason nuclear power hasn't been adopted yet. The other options (B, C, and D) are not mentioned or implied in the text.



Therefore, the most logical answer based on the provided text is A."
I murheti wihi wa le ayisini loyi a nga phikizana hi mpfuno wa mukongomisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The passage states: ""Murheti wa le asiyini wa le Poland loyi a nga voniki kahle ku nga **Maciej Krezel** ni mukongomisi ku nga Anna Ogarzynska va hetelele eka khumemune eka Super-G.""

This translates to: ""The Polish athlete who did not perform well along with the official **Maciej Krezel** and the official Anna Ogarzynska won a medal in the Super-G.""

Therefore, Maciej Krezel is the Polish athlete who did not perform well and was mentioned in the context of not meeting expectations.
"
I tiko rihi leri nga hetelela eka vukhume eka Super-G ya vavasati?,"The correct answer is **A: E Finland**.

The text states: ""Swi katsa Netherlands, laha Anna Jochemsen a heteleleke eka vukaye eka Super-G ya vavasati... Naswona Finland ni Katja Saarinen u hetelele eka vukhume eka xiendlakalo lexi fanaka.""  This translates to: ""It started in the Netherlands, where Anna Jochemsen achieved a podium finish in the Women's Super-G... Also, in Finland, Katja Saarinen achieved a podium finish in the corresponding event."" Therefore, Katja Saarinen achieved a podium finish in the Women's Super-G in Finland.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi malunghana ni Blake leswi nga riki swo kongoma?","The correct answer is **C: U tirhise mhanzi hi nkarhi wa ku hlasela**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Blake na yena a khomeriwe ku ringeta ku onha ndlela ya vululami. Muavanyisi u byele Blake leswaku “swi tikomba swi nga kanakanisi” leswaku u ta ya ejele.""  This translates to: ""Blake was also charged with conspiracy. The prosecutor told Blake that “the evidence was insufficient” and that he would go to jail.""

The text further explains that Blake was charged with ""ku tirhise mhanzi hi nkarhi wa ku hlasela"" - which means ""using a weapon during the attack."" This is the key element that led to the prosecutor's statement about jail time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U khomiwe kwalaho (Charged with conspiracy):** While Blake was charged with conspiracy, it's the use of a weapon that is the primary reason for the potential jail time.
*   **B: U pfumele ku hlasela (Failing to attack):** This is the opposite of what Blake was accused of.
*   **D: U vule leswaku u hoxiwe hi mabodlela (Stating he was attacked with bottles):**  While the attack involved bottles, Blake's charge wasn't about stating that fact, but about the weapon used *during* the attack.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga humelelanga Blake?","The correct answer is **A: U kumiwe a ri ni nandzu wa ku ringeta ku onha ndlela ya vululami**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Blake na yena a khomeriwe ku ringeta ku onha ndlela ya vululami."" This directly translates to ""Blake was arrested for attempting to engage in indecent behavior.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U khomiwile (He was arrested):** While true, option A is *more specific* and describes the reason for his arrest.
* **C: U hlaseriwe hi mhanzi (He was attacked by a mace):** This happened to the victims, not Blake.
* **D: U byeriwe leswaku swi nga endleka leswaku u ta ya ejele (He was told that he might go to jail):** This was a warning from the prosecutor, not a direct consequence that happened to Blake.



"
I yini leswi mali ya U.N. yo hakela matiko lama khumbiwaka hi ku hisa ka misava yi nge tirhisiwiki eka swona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku tisa thekinoloji ku pfuna matiko lama endlaka nhluvuko.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the U.N. hopes to use funds to support the research of the seeds collected.  Option B directly reflects this.  The passage explicitly mentions the technology being used to study the seeds' growth processes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku byala timbewu to hambanahambana (Planting diverse crops):** While potentially a goal, the passage states that funds will be used for supporting *research* on the seeds, not directly for planting.
*   **C: Tindlu leti kotaka ku langutana ni ku khukhuriwa (Construction of research facilities):** The passage mentions funds for ""tindlu leti kotaka ku langutana ni ku khukhuriwa"" which translates to ""facilities for research and storage"". So this option is related to the funds being used but not the main focus of what the funds are intended *for*.
*   **D: Ku hunguta switandzhaku swa ku hisa ka misava (Improving agricultural practices):** While related to the overall goal, the passage says the funds will be for *research* on the seeds, not directly for improving agricultural practices.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, U.N. yi na ntshembo wa ku ponisa yini?","The correct answer is **A: Mali, hi ku avelana ka thekinoloji**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""U.N. yi tlhela yi tshemba leswaku yi ta hetisisa ku va ni mali yo hakela matiko lama khumbiwaka hi ku hisa ka misava ku langutana ni switandzhaku swa kona."" (The UN has always hoped to raise money to fund the recovery of the soil by allowing the soil to recover with plants and wildlife.)

It also mentions that the money will be used for things like building shelters, water conservation, and planting diverse crops. However, the primary goal the UN hopes to achieve with the raised money is to *have the money itself*, and this will be facilitated by leveraging technology. Options B, C, and D are things the money *will be used for*, not the primary goal the UN hopes to achieve.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga vuriwanga hi Albert Muchanga tanihi swilo leswi va ha ta pfumelelana hi swona?,"The correct answer is **D: Ntsengo wa swo famba (Tariff regulations)**.

Albert Muchanga explicitly states that the issue is about ""a lack of agreement on tariff regulations."" The other options are related to the context but not the *specific* issue he mentions.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini ku xavisa ku nga ta sungula hi July?","The correct answer is **B: Ku vekiwe milawu na ntsengo wa swo famba leyi ringaneke.**

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""A hi si pfumelelana eka milawu na ntsengo wa swo famba...kambe leswi hi nga na swona swi ringene leswaku hi sungula ku xavisa hi July 1, 2020.""  This directly implies that the resolution of the legal and logistical issues (milawu na ntsengo wa swo famba) is what allowed the launch to be scheduled for July 1st.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Siku ra ku sungula hi July a ku ri xiphemu xa mintwanano ya Nigeria ya ku nghenela AfCFTA** - While Nigeria *wanted* to join, the passage doesn't say July is specifically a milestone for their agreement.
* **C: Ri pfumeleriwe hi mukhomixinara wa vuxavisi bya AU** - The Mukhomixinara's statement was about Benin's situation, not Nigeria's.  His statement *contributed* to the possibility of launch, but it wasn't the *reason* for the July launch.
* **D: Va pfumelelane hi milawu na ntsengo wa swo famba** -  The passage explicitly states they *didn't* agree on the laws and customs initially.  The fact that they *later* reached an agreement is what enabled the launch.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi Atlanta Journal-Constitution yi nga sola vatirhi va swa dyondzo hi swona?","The correct answer is **A: Xiviko xa Journal-Constitution xi kavanyetiwile** (The Journal-Constitution's investigation uncovered fraud).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...vumbhoni byi kombise leswaku maphephe ya swikambelo a ya kavanyetiwile hi ndlela yo pasisa eka Hall..."" (Evidence showed that the school records were falsified to benefit Hall...). This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku tsandzeka ku endla swilo leswintshwa eka swa tidyondzo ta le madorobeni** (Fraudulent activities were happening in the city's school system): While the passage *mentions* fraudulent activities, the question asks what the *Journal-Constitution exposed*. Option A is a more direct and accurate answer.
* **C: Ku kumiwa ka swiphiqo kambe va nga endlanga nchumu hi sweswo** (Scores were inflated and they were also dishonest): This is true based on the passage, but it doesn't specifically describe what the newspaper *revealed*.
* **D: Ku vika mapasiselo lama tlakukeke** (Inflated scores were created): This is a detail from the passage, but it's not the core of what the newspaper *exposed*.

Therefore, option A is the most precise and correct answer based on the information provided."
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, i yini lexi nga vuriwanga eka xiviko xa Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **B: Vumbhoni bya ku kanvanyetiwa ka maphephe ya swikambelo.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Endzhaku ka sweswo vumbhoni byi kombise leswaku maphephe ya swikambelo a ya kavanyetiwile hi ndlela yo pasisa eka Hall..."" This directly addresses the option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tlakuka loku nga tolovelekanga eka mapasiselo:** While the passage mentions the initial issues with test scores, the main focus of the question is what was *not* revealed in the article. The article *did* reveal this.
* **C: Muhluri wa Suparinthendenti wa Tiko eka Lembe ra 2013:** The passage mentions Hall becoming Superintendent in 2013, but the question asks what was *not* revealed in the article. The article *did* reveal this.
* **D: Swiringanyeto swa ku endla swilo leswintshwa eka swa tidyondzo ta le madorobeni:** This refers to the Superintendent's past, which is mentioned but not the core of what the article *didn't* reveal. The article *did* reveal this.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i rungula rihi leri tivekaka endzhaku ka ku bomiwa?","The correct answer is **A: Nhlayo yo hetelela ya vanhu lava nga vaviseka (Conflicting opinions of the people who were vaccinated)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while some reports suggest high vaccination rates, other reports indicate that around 30 people have had adverse reactions.
* The question asks what happened *after* the vaccination.
* The most logical consequence of conflicting reports about vaccination and adverse reactions is that there are conflicting opinions and concerns from the people involved.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Miako leyi tibomu ti bulukeke ekusuhi na yona (The years that the vaccines were developed and distributed):** This describes the timeline, not what happened after the vaccines were administered.
* **C: Xana a ku ta va ni timbomu leti engetelekeke leti a ti ta bulukisiwa (Whether there were additional, secret vaccines that were distributed):** The passage doesn't suggest anything about secret vaccines.
* **D: Swiviko leswi tshembekaka swa vanhu lava feke (The verified reports of the people who were vaccinated):** While verified reports are important, the passage highlights *conflicting* reports.  Focusing solely on verified reports doesn't address the core issue of differing opinions and adverse reactions.



"
"Ku sukela a nga nghenela Manchester City hi 2017, Jesus u tlange ka mintlangu yingani?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The question asks how many years Jesus has been at Manchester City since joining in 2017. The passage states: ""Ku sukela kwalaho, Muburazili loyi u tlange mintlangu ya 53 eka tlilaba..."" which translates to ""Since then, the Brazilian who has played for 53 years..."".
"
I tlilaba yihi leyi Jesus a nga kuma ntsengo wa £27 wa timiliyoni hi ku nghenelela?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The question asks where Jesus came from *before* joining Manchester City. The text states he joined Manchester City from Palmeiras.
"
I swiga swihi malunghana ni vaendzi va hostela leswi nga riki ntiyiso?,"The correct answer is **C: Vaendzi a va tele eve of hajj** (People are on their way for the pilgrimage).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Eka miako a ku ri na vanhu vo hlayanyana lava a va tele ku vhakela doroba ra ku kwetsima eka siku ra le mahlweni ka hajj pilgrimage."" (For many years, many people have traveled to the holy city on the first day of the Hajj pilgrimage.)
* The question asks *why* people are in Mecca. The text gives the reason: to perform the Hajj pilgrimage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vaendzi a va ri eMecca hikwalaho ka pilgrimage** (People are in Mecca because of the pilgrimage): While true, it's a restatement of the reason, not *why* they are there in the context of the situation.
* **B: Vaendzi van’wana a ku nga ri vanhu va kwalaho** (Other people who are not sick): This is irrelevant to the question. The passage doesn't mention anyone being sick.
* **D: Votala va vaendzi a va huma eka doroba ya ku kwetsima** (People who have left the holy city): This is the opposite of what the passage describes – people are *arriving* in Mecca for the pilgrimage.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **B: Vaendzi hinkwavo a va huma eUnited Arab Emirates**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Votala ka vaendzi lava a va fikele eka hositele a va huma eUnited Arab Emirates."" This translates to ""A number of people who arrived at the hostel came from the United Arab Emirates.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ku na vanhu lava feke (There are pilgrims):** While the passage mentions pilgrims, it doesn't say *only* pilgrims arrived. It speaks about the people arriving at the hostel.
* **C: Vaendzi a va tele eve of hajj pilgrimage (People who are far from the hajj pilgrimage):** This is the opposite of what the passage says. It says they *arrived* for the pilgrimage.
* **D: Votala va vaendzi a ku ri vanhu va le Mecca (A number of people who are people of Mecca):** The passage refers to people *coming to* Mecca, not people who already live there.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i rungula rihi malunghana ni ku tlumbana leri nga tiyisekangiki?","The correct answer is **A: Vukulu bya ku tlumbana (The scale of the conflict)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Van’wasayense va ri ku buluka loku ku endliweke hi ku tlumbana aku ri kukulu swinene."" which translates to ""Scientists say that the conflict that occurred was not very large."" This directly addresses the scale or size of the conflict.

While the other options are mentioned, the core focus of the scientists' statement is the *scale* of the conflict being unexpectedly small. The debiri (two reports) are mentioned as a detail about the reporting process, not a direct finding about the conflict itself.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi va ha ringeta ku swi vona malunghana ni ku tlumbana?","The correct answer is **D: Vukulu lebyi kongomeke bya ku tlumbana**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Van’wasayense va ri ku buluka loku ku endliweke hi ku tlumbana aku ri kukulu swinene. Na sweswi va ha ringeta ku vona vukulu bya ku tlumbana na ndlela leyi misava yi nga ta khumbekaka ha yona.""  This translates to: ""Scientists believe that the movement caused by the collision is not very large. This has led them to observe the magnitude of the collision and how the Earth will remember it.""  Therefore, the scientists are focusing on the *magnitude* or size of the impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I mani la nga ta khoma vukambisisi bya ti debiri (Who will publish the two reports):** While the passage mentions the reports will be published, it doesn't say *who* will publish them.  The focus isn't on the publisher.
* **B: Rivilo leri tisethalayiti a ti tsutsuma hi wona hi nkarhi wa ku tlumbana (The data the satellites collected during the collision):** The passage states the satellites *measured* the collision, but it doesn't focus on the specific data collected. The emphasis is on the *result* of the measurement – the size of the collision.
* **C: Ndlela leyi mbuyelo wa ku kambisisa wu ta averiwa hi yona (How the report will be published):** The passage mentions the report will be published on a website, but it doesn't focus on the *method* of publication. It's about the information being released, not how.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, u tshama a ri eka ndhawu yihi Batten eka nxaxamelo wa Maamerika lama Fuweke Swinene?","The correct answer is **A: Ya vu 400**.

The question states: ""Batten a pimiwa eka nxaxamelo wa 400 wa Maamerika lama Fuweke Swinene..."" which translates to ""Batten was elected to the 400 of the American Association for the Advancement of Science..."". 

Therefore, the answer is 400.
"
Batten u hoxe xandla eka yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Nhlayo leyikulu ya swivandla (Major scientific breakthrough)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Batten was involved in a ""nhlayo ya 190 hi 2008 eka nxaxamelo wa 400 wa Maamerika lama Fuweke Swinene lava nga ni rifuwo leri ringanyetiwaka eka $2.3 wa tibiliyoni"" which translates to ""a major scientific breakthrough in the 2008 American Genome Project with an estimated $2.3 trillion in funding.""  The question asks what Batten was involved in *after* graduating from the University of Virginia and working at the College of Physicians and Scientists.  The passage directly links his involvement to this major scientific breakthrough.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nxaxamelo wa Maamerika lama Fuweke Swinene (American Genome Project):** While he was involved in the project, the question asks what he *worked on* after his education and initial career.
* **B: Yunivhesiti ya Virginia (University of Virginia):**  He graduated *from* the University of Virginia; he wasn't involved in anything *after* that related to the university itself in the context of the passage.
* **D: Tikholichini ta vutshila na sayense (College of Physicians and Scientists):** He worked *at* the College, but the passage focuses on his involvement in the much larger scientific breakthrough that followed his work there.



"
I yini lexi nga riki xiphemu xa nawu lowu nga sayiniwa hi Murhangeri Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku sivela ku xavisiwa kumbe ku lombisiwa ka mintlangu ya ti vhidiyo leyi nga ni madzolonga eka vana lavatsongo va le handle ka California.**

Here's why:

* The question asks what Arnold Schwarzenegger's signature is *about*.
* The provided text clearly states his signature is regarding the **sale or rental of videos containing child pornography in California**.
* Option C accurately reflects this central theme.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This is too broad. While the sale/rental is *related* to the issue, it doesn't capture the core of what he's addressing.
* **B:**  The $1000 fine is a consequence of violating the law, not the subject of the signature itself.
* **D:** While the law includes the seizure of the videos, the signature's focus is on the sale/rental aspect.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani la nga twanga swilo leswi a swi vuriwa?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage states: ""Miller u te, “Mike u vulavula ngopfu hi nkarhi wa nhlangano ...A ndzi nga swi twi kahle leswi a a swi vula.”"" This directly indicates that Miller is the one who couldn't understand what Mike was saying.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ntiyiso hi leswi nga humelela Miller eka nhlangano?","The correct answer is **A: Duvall u tsakise Miller hi nkarhi wa nhlangano**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Duvall was preventing Miller from speaking about the meeting. 
* Miller's statement, ""Mike u vulavula ngopfu hi nkarhi wa nhlangano ...A ndzi nga swi twi kahle leswi a a swi vula,"" indicates he was trying to discuss the meeting but was being blocked.
* Therefore, Duvall was likely the one silencing Miller, preventing him from speaking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A nga nyikele nyingiso loko a ri karhi a ti lunghisa:** The passage doesn't mention Miller being able to prepare or smiling.
* **C: Vana vambirhi va Duvall a va vulavula ngopfu hi nkarhi wa nhlangano:** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: A nyikele nyingiso eka xitori xa Duvall:** There's no indication that Miller is mocking Duvall's story.



"
I mani la nga ringanyeta leswaku ku kambisisiwa “Nawu wa Moya wo Tenga”?,"The correct answer is **A: John Howard**.

The passage states: ""Holobyenkulu John Howard u vule leswaku xiendlo xo sirhelela miako yo tirhisiwa ya xibedlhela leswaku yi nga yisiwa ehansi hi hulumendhe ya Tasmania, hi ku nyika mali leyi engetelekeke ya AUD$45 wa timiliyoni."" This directly indicates that John Howard is the one who spoke about the situation.
"
I mani la nga kaneta leswaku “Nawu wa Moya wo Tenga” a ku ri xiendlo lexi tanihi ndlela yo kavenyeta nhlawulo lowu nga ta endliwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Murhangeri wa NDP**.

The text states: ""...endzhaku ka nhlangano wa timinete ta 25 wa Ravumbirhi swin’we na murhangeri wa NDP ku nga Jack Layton eka PMO. Layton a a komberile ku cinciwa ka papila ra nawu ra mbango ra lava lavaka vulawuri byo va na swipimelo hi nkarhi wa nhlangano siwn’we na PM, a kombela """"ku tsariwa vuntshwa hi ku hetiseka """" ka nawu wa mbango wa vandla ro fuma hi Swipimelo.""

This clearly indicates that Jack Layton, the NDP leader, objected to the use of the ""Royal Warrant"" as a means of circumventing environmental protection.
"
Tikhomphawundi ta cyanuric asidi na melamine ti endle yini loko ti cinca ti hlangana eka murhundzu wa swimanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti khirisitali**.

The passage states: ""Ti khomphawundi leti timbirhi ta cinca loko ti hlangana ti endla ti khirisitali leti nga sivelaka ku tirha ka tinsu..."" which translates to ""These two compounds react when they come together to form crystals that can be harmful...""

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
Valavisisi va tirhise infrared spectroscopy ku vona yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Endlelo ra ti khirisitali eka murhundzu wa swiharhi swa le kaya.**

Here's why:

The question states: ""Ti khirisitali leti endlekeke eka murhundzu wa swimanga hi ku hoxa melamine na cyanuric asidi. Valavisisi va langutise ti khirisitali leti endlekeke eka murhundzu wa swiharhi hi ku hoxa melamine na cyanuric asidi."" and ""Endlelo ra ti khirisitali leti ya fana na lama kumekaka eka murhundzu wa swiharhi leswi khumbekeke loko swi pimanisiwa hi infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

This directly links infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to analyzing the **pattern of the crystals** found in the domestic waste.  FTIR spectroscopy is a technique used to identify substances based on their vibrational frequencies, which create a unique ""fingerprint"" of the molecule. In this case, the researchers used FTIR to compare the crystal pattern to known patterns of domestic waste.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tirha ka tinsu:** While the crystals *prevent* the formation of plastic, FTIR is not used to study the plastic formation.
* **C: Swiharhi swa le kaya leswi nga khumbeka:** FTIR doesn't directly identify the waste itself; it identifies the components *within* the waste.
* **D: Swakudya swa swiharhi swa le kaya leswi nyamisiweke:** FTIR wouldn't be directly used to identify the food waste. It would analyze the chemical components that resulted from the decomposition of the food waste.



"
I mani la nga vitana Luna tanihi “Hosi Ya Xisati ya Xiyimo Xa le Henhla Ngopfu”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer u te “Luna a a ri Hosi Ya Xisati ya Xiyimo Xa le Henhla Ngopfu. Murhangeri wa mina wo sungula."" (Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna is the Queen of the Above-and-Beyond. My originator."").
"
I mani loyi a nga vitana Luna tanihi “hambanile”?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dustin “Goldust” Runnels u vule leswi “Luna a a hambanile hi ndlela leyinene ku fana na mina…”"" which translates to ""Dustin “Goldust” Runnels said “Luna is different in a way similar to me…”"".  He's the one who describes Luna as ""hambanile"" (different/unique).

Option A is incorrect because while those who love her might think she's different, the text points specifically to Dustin.

Options C and D are incorrect because the sound technicians and Tommy Dreamer are describing their feelings about Luna, not using the term ""hambanile"" to describe her.
"
I yini leswi nga si humelela eka muchayeri la nga katseka eka ntlumbano?,"The correct answer is **A: U vaviseke enhlokweni** (He hit his head).

The text explicitly states: ""Hambiswiritano, muchayeri u vaviseke ngopfu enhlokweni."" (Furthermore, the driver hit his head severely.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A nga vavisanga na un’we wa vanhu lava a va ri endzeni ka movha** (He didn't move and someone else in the car). While the text mentions someone didn't move, the key consequence for the driver is the head injury.
* **C: U susiwile exibedlhela xa Cambridge a ya eGreat Yarmouth** (He was taken to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge after being taken to the Great Yarmouth hospital). This describes the medical procedure, not the immediate consequence of the accident.
* **D: Vukorhokeri bya xihatla byi pfune ku n’wi susa eka movha wa yena** (The airbags tried to pull him out of the car). This describes the airbag deployment, not the injury sustained by the driver.

I yini leswi a swi nga humelelanga hi ndlela yo tlanga ya Afrika Dzonga hi nkarhi wa mphikizano wa rugby?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntirhisano lowunene (Genuine teamwork)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vatlangi vale ndzhaku lava nga ni ntokoto, na **vuswikoti byo tirhisa bolo ni ntirhisano lowunene** ku endle leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona swi le rivaleni leswaku va humelela naswona"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ntlangu wa Afrika Dzonga wu sungule rini ku antswa?","The correct answer is **A: Kwalomu ka 10:00 am**.

The text states: ""Mintlango yi sungule hi 10:00am..."" which translates to ""The match started at 10:00 am...""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi leswi landzelaka leswi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma ikhonomi ya Chayina?","The correct answer is **B: Chayina yi na makete lowukulu eka swa timovha ku hundza United States**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the *consequences* of China's economic reforms. Option B directly states a consequence: China has become a major market for cars, even surpassing the United States. The text explicitly mentions this point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikhonomi ya Chayina yi kule swinene ku sukela ku lunghisiwa:** This is a general statement about the state of the economy *after* reforms, not a specific consequence.
*   **C: GDP ya Chayina yi nga hundza ya le United States:** This is also a statement about the state of the economy, specifically comparing GDP, and not a consequence of the reforms.
*   **D: Chayina a yi si tshama yi xavisele matiko timovha to tala ku hundza Jarimani:** This statement is *incorrect*. The text states China *did* export cars to Germany and the US.



Therefore, option B is the only option that accurately reflects a direct consequence mentioned in the text regarding the impact of China's economic reforms."
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, GDP ya Chayina yi nga hundza ya le United States rini?","The correct answer is **B: Eka malembe ya makume mbirhi**.

The text explicitly states: ""GDP ya Chayina yi nga hundza ya le United States eka malembe ya makume mbirhi."" (China's GDP could surpass that of the United States in 20 years.)
"
I yini leswi Hu a nga swi ringanyeta leswaku matiko lama hluvukaka ma swi endla?,"The correct answer is **A: Va byarha vutihlamuleri lebyi nga ta va susumetela ku kula**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""a va fanelanga, hambiswiritano, va komberiwa ku byarha vutihlamuleri lebyi nga ehenhla ka ku kula ka vona, vutihlamuleri ni vuswikoti.""  This directly translates to: ""they should, in a coordinated manner, be encouraged to develop technologies that can help cure their illnesses, technologies and innovations.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku dzika eka mpindzulo wa ikhonomi:** While economic recovery is mentioned as a context, it's not what Hu specifically wants the developing countries to *do*.
* **C: Ku ya ehenhla ka vutihlamuleri bya vona bya sweswi:**  This is too broad. Hu isn't just saying they should advance their technologies; he's specifying the type of technology – those that can help cure illnesses.
* **D: Ku papalata maendlelo ya khale yo thyakisa:** This refers to leveraging old developments, which Hu mentions as a general strategy.  It's not the specific action he wants developing countries to take.



"
I yini leswi nga vuriwanga hi Hu?,"The best answer is **B: Xitsundzuxo eka matiko lama hluvukaka malunghana ni ku thyakisa (Innovation in key industries and carbon capture)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Hu khutaze matimba lama endlaka nhluvuko “ku papalata maendlelo ya khale yo rhanga hi ku thyakisa ivi ma basisa endzhaku ka sweswo.”"" This translates to ""Hu emphasized the importance of developing innovation in key industries and carbon capture and utilization, and building on previous achievements."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ku endliwa ka ku hunguta (Development through innovation):** While innovation is mentioned, the focus isn't *just* on development through innovation. It's a broader strategy encompassing carbon capture.
* **C: Siku leri ku tshembiwaka leswaku ku ta hungutiwa nthyakiso wa khaboni dayiokisayidi (The time when carbon capture and utilization is expected to be implemented):** The text describes the *strategy* and *importance* of carbon capture, not a specific implementation timeline.
* **D: Mpimo wa ku hunguteka ka nthyakiso wa carbon (The scale of carbon capture and utilization):** The text mentions a specific scale (China's carbon emission reduction target) but the main point isn't just about the scale, but the *strategy* behind it.



Therefore, option B is the most comprehensive and accurate summary of what Hu is saying in the provided text.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi Veerman a nga vula leswaku xiyimo a xi ka kahle eka swona?,"The correct answer is **B: E Angola**.

Here's why:

The quote from Richard Veerman says: “Angola yi langutane ni ntungu wo chavisaka lowu nga si tshamaka wu va kona naswona xiyimo xa ha bihile swinene eAngola.”  This translates to: ""Angola is struggling with an antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which is not a problem we have seen so much of in Angola.""  He is directly stating the problem is *in Angola*.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Medecines Sans Frontieres** - This is the organization Veerman represents, not the location of the problem.
*   **C: Mangola** - Mangola is mentioned as a source of funding, not where the problem is located.
*   **D: Nhlangano wa Rihanyo wa Misava Hinkwayo** - This is another organization involved, not the location of the problem.



"
"Hikwalaho ka ku tengisiwa, i mani la nga ta teka xiyimo xa Huhne xa Khabinete?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Huhne u tsale papila ro tshika ntirho eka Khabinete naswona u ta siviwa hi **Ed Davey MP**."" This indicates that Ed Davey is taking over Huhne's position in the Cabinet.
"
I mani la nga ta teka ntirho wa Ndzawulo ya swa Mabindzu loko ku tengisiwile?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Nirman Lamb MP u languteriwe ku teka ntirho wa Ndzawulo ya swa Mabindzu leyi Davey a yi sukelaka."" (Nirman Lamb MP has been appointed to take over the role of the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy that Davey has left.)
"
Vatlangi va khuthaza vahlaleri leswaku va endla yini hi nkarhi wa ntlangu wa Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **A: Va hlanganyela eka ku dzaha mbangi** (They participated in a concert).

The question states that the audience was excited by the story and it ""spurred them to attend the concert."" Therefore, the audience participated in a concert.
"
I mani kahle-kahle loyi a dzahaka mbangi hi nkarhi wa ntlangu?,"The correct answer is **C: Vatlangi**.

The question asks who *liked* the story. The text states: ""Vatlangi va dzaha mbangi va ri exitejini naswona xitori hi xoxe xi khutaza vahlaleri leswaku na vona va va joyina."" This translates to ""The storytellers were excited by the story, and also the audience was captivated, so they enjoyed it.""

Therefore, the audience (vatlangi) liked the story.
"
I rihi vito rin’wana ra “ku famba exibakabakeni” loku Leonov a nga ku endla?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntirho lowu wu sunguriweke ku endliwa hi munhu wa kuya exibakabakeni.**

The passage states: ""Hi March 18, 1965, u endle ntirho lowu wu sunguriweke ku endliwa hi munhu wa kuya exibakabakeni, kumbe """"ku famba exibakabakeni""""..."" This directly identifies ""Ntirho lowu wu sunguriweke ku endliwa hi munhu wa kuya exibakabakeni"" as another name for ""ku famba exibakabakeni.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ntirho wa Apollo-Soyuz:** This is a later event that *demonstrated* improved cooperation, but it wasn't the name of the initial spacewalk activity.
*   **B: Mphikizano wa le Xibakabakeni:** This describes the broader trend of cooperation in space, not the specific activity Leonov performed.
*   **D: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is Leonov's designation, not the name of the activity itself.

Leonov u rhangele xiphemu xa Soviet eka ntirho wihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Mphikizano wa le Xibakabakeni (Space Cooperation)**.

The text states: ""...u rhangele xiyenge xa Soviet xa Apollo–Soyuz leswi a swi kombisa leswaku **mphikizano wa le xibakabakeni wu herile.**"" ( ...he later reflected on the Soviet space program, which demonstrated that **space cooperation had improved**.)

While the other options are mentioned, the question asks *what* Leonov reflected on *regarding* a particular event. The text explicitly connects his reflection to improved space cooperation, specifically highlighted by the Apollo-Soyuz mission.
"
I mani la nga vaviseka eka ku chayisa?,"The correct answer is **D: Muchayeri wa lori**.

The text states: ""Muchayeri wa lori, wa malembe ya 64, a nga vavisekaka loko yi chayisile."" This translates to ""The truck driver, aged 64, couldn't recognize it when it was driven.""
"
Ku endleke yini hi vanhu lava nga katseka eka khombo?,"The correct answer is **C: A va huwelela ni ku rila** (They were huddled and sleeping).

The text states: ""A ku ri ni vana lava rindzeleke ku tsemakanya patu naswona hinkwavo a va huwelela ni ku rila.""  This translates to ""There were also children huddled and sleeping with them."" This directly answers the question of what happened to the people who were caught in the truck.
"
Van’wasayense lava tirhaka eka nongonoko a va tshemba leswaku va ta vona nhlohlotelo wihi eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Nchumu lowu tolovelekeke** (The rotating disk).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Van’wasayense va swi kotile ku gimeta hileswaku nchumu wa ntima wu khumba nchumu wun’wana wa ntima hilaha nchumu lowu tolovelekeke wa ntima wu endlaka hakona.""  This translates to ""Scientists have calculated that the central disk is being influenced by another disk, and the rotating disk is being formed.""

Therefore, the scientists are hoping to observe the **rotating disk** as a result of this influence.



"
Van’wasayense va vone nchumu wa yini eka leswi landzelalaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Xirimela xa Sagittarius na Milky Way**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nlohlotelo wa ntlawa lowu a wu languteriwile wu vangiwe hi matimba ya gandlati exikarhi ka nchumu wa ntima wa xirimela na nchumu wa ntima wa Milky Way.""  This directly translates to ""The observed distortion has been caused by the gravity of the center of the galaxy and the center of the Milky Way.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga riki swi xopaxopiwa hi lava nga ni mavonelo ya vona?","The correct answer is **B: Ku pfumaleka ka matshalatshala ya mpfuxeto**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku xopaxopa ka lava lwelaka ntshunxeko ka matshalatshala ya mpfuxeto lama lavaka ku nyika tikontiraka ta mpfuxeto eka lava tekiwaka va le vatirhi va le ndzeni ka Washington.""  This translates to ""There is controversy among those with connections regarding the blossoming of timber that provides timber contracts to those who were affected by the work at the heart of Washington.""

The passage highlights the controversy *regarding the timber* and the contracts it generated.  The other options are either directly stated as being investigated (""Nkanerisano wu pfuxiwe hi nkwetlembetano wa mali..."") or are consequences of the timber controversy, but not the *subject* of the controversy itself.
"
I mani la nga xopaxopa mpfuxeto wa tikontiraka eka matshalatshala ya ku pfuna Bubutsa ra Katrina?,"The correct answer is **B: Lava lwelaka ntshunxeko**.

The passage states: ""Ku xopaxopa ka lava lwelaka ntshunxeko ka matshalatshala ya mpfuxeto lama lavaka ku nyika tikontiraka ta mpfuxeto eka lava tekiwaka va le vatirhi va le ndzeni ka Washington."" This directly translates to ""People who are seeking profit from the debris from the Katrina disaster are making deals to obtain debris contracts for those who were evacuated to Washington.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lava nga ni mavonelo ya vona va endleke mafenya** - ""Those who have their own grievances have spoken out"" - While related, this describes *who* is speaking out, not *who* is profiting from the debris.
*   **C: Bush** - The passage mentions the ""Nxaviselo Lowuntshwa wa Bush le New Orleans"" (Bush administration's looting of New Orleans), but it doesn't say Bush himself is profiting. It refers to the administration's actions.
*   **D: Vatirhi va le ndzeni ka Washington** - ""Those who were evacuated to Washington"" - This describes the recipients of the contracts, not the people profiting from the debris.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, hi le kwihi la ku nga ta va vonanakala ku sungula nkombiso ku huma eka xibamubamu xa Stardust?","The correct answer is **B: N’walungwini wa California**.

The passage states: ""ku languteriwe leswaku ku va ni nkombiso wutsongo eka vanhu va le N’walungwini wa California..."" This means the initial detection of the meteoroid's trail happened over California.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, xibamubamu xi ta veka rhekhodo leyintshwa ya yini eka leswi landzelaka?","The correct answer is **C: Ku tlhelela Emisaveni hi ku hatlisa swinene** (Traveling to space very fast).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Stardust yi ta veka rhekhodo leyintshwa ya misava hi ku va xibamubamu lexintshwa xa nkarhi hinkwawo lexi nga ta tlhelela eMisaveni, xi tlula rhekhodo ya nkarhi lowu hundzeke leyi endliweke hi May wa 1969 hi nkarhi wa ku tlhela ka Apollo X command module.""  This directly translates to: ""Stardust will set a new world record for the fastest spacecraft to travel to space, surpassing the previous record set in May 1969 by the Apollo X command module.""

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: Ku voninga tilo hi vukulu lebyi nga anama swinene** (Seeing very large objects clearly): While Stardust *did* observe comets, the record being set is for *speed* to reach space.
*   **B: Ku vonaka eka madoroba yo tala** (Appearing in the first cities): The passage mentions observations over California, Oregon, Nevada, Idaho, and Utah, not specific cities.
*   **D: Ku suka e San Francisco ku fika le Los Angeles hi ku hlatlisa swinene** (Traveling from San Francisco to Los Angeles very fast): This refers to a distance on Earth, not space travel.

Dr. Malar Balasubramanian i maxaka njhani na Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Manana**.

The text states: ""Dok. Malar Balasubramanian, 29, u kumiwile le Blue Ash, Ohio, muganga wa kwalomu ka timayili ta 15 en’walungwini wa Cincinnati a etlele ehansi ekusuhi ni patu a ambale xikipa ni xirhangiso a languteka a nwe mirhi swinene. U kongomise vatirhelamfumo eka Oldsmobile Intrigue yakwe ya ntima leyi a yi ri emphukeni wa magoza ya 500. **Kualaho, va kume ntsumbu wa Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, wu funengetiwe hi mikumba leyi nga ni ngati.** Maphorisa ma vule leswaku ntsumbu a wu languteka wu ve kwalaho kwalomu ka siku.""

This clearly indicates that Saroja Balasubramanian is Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother.
"
Hi le kwihi la ku nga kumiwa ntsumbu wa Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekusuhi ni patu**.

The text states: ""Dok. Malar Balasubramanian, 29, u kumiwile le Blue Ash, Ohio, muganga wa kwalomu ka timayili ta 15 en’walungwini wa Cincinnati a etlele ehansi ekusuhi ni patu a ambale xikipa ni xirhangiso a languteka a nwe mirhi swinene."" This translates to: ""Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, 29, was found lying down in Blue Ash, Ohio, a suburb 15 miles northwest of Cincinnati, after a car crash...""  Therefore, she was found **ekusuhi ni patu (northwest)** of Cincinnati.
"
I yini leyi nga xaviwa hi eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The question states: ""Ku xaviwa ka khampani leyi hi lokukulu ematin’wini ya eBay...yo tanihi Chayina, eVuxeni bya Yuropa ni le Brazil. Skype yi nga ni matimba eka wona."" (A company that is very popular on eBay is used... in China, Europe and Brazil. Skype is powerful there.)

Therefore, Skype is the company being referred to.
"
I yini leswi eBay yi lavaka ku swi fikelela hi leswi nga xaviwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku kurisa xiyimo xa yona (To expand its business)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states eBay wants to ""ndlandlamuxa tindhawu leti yi ngheniselaka mali ni ku va yi duma swinene"".  This means they want to expand into profitable and popular markets.
* The passage also mentions countries where Skype has a strong presence (China, Europe, Brazil). This suggests eBay wants to expand its reach into those same strong markets.
* Option C directly reflects this desire to expand the company's overall business reach.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ku hlanganisa mali leyi nghenaka (To gather that money):** While earning money is a goal, it's a *result* of expanding, not the primary goal.
* **B: Ku ya eka tindhawu letintshwa (To go to other places):** This is too general.  eBay isn't just going to other places; they're targeting specific markets.
* **D: Ku enerisa lava ku nga endliwa bindzu na vona (To bring in people who can't work):** This is irrelevant to eBay's business strategy and a misinterpretation of the passage.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i va mani lava nga tihlanganisaka ni vabohiwa lava nga sala ejarateni endzhaku ka ku lwa?","The correct answer is **C: Vatirhelamfumo**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku nga ri khale, vatirhelamfumo lava a va hlome hi switirho swo lwisana ni hasahasa va nghene ejarateni ivi va hlasela vabohiwa hi gasi yo humesa mihloti.""  This translates to: ""It is likely that mercenaries armed with assault weapons entered the hangar and attacked the hostages with tear gas.""

Therefore, the mercenaries are the ones who interacted with the hostages after the initial attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vakanerisi (Mechanics):** Mechanics were investigating the situation, not involved in the attack or interaction with the hostages after it happened.
*   **B: Mintlawa yo sirhelela endzilweni (Firefighters):** Firefighters arrived later to deal with the aftermath, not the immediate interaction.
*   **D: Vatirhi va le xibedlhela (People from the hangar):** The passage mentions people *from* the hangar were victims, but it doesn't say they interacted with the hostages afterward.



"
I yini eku heteleleni leswi nga vanga leswaku vabohiwa va tshika hasahasa?,"The correct answer is **B: Gasi yo humesa mihloti**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku nga ri khale, vatirhelamfumo lava a va hlome hi switirho swo lwisana ni hasahasa va nghene ejarateni ivi va hlasela vabohiwa hi **gasi yo humesa mihloti**."" (It seems that armed perpetrators entered the pharmacy and attacked the victims with **sleeping gas**.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku kanerisana loku nga humelela** (Lack of ventilation) - While potentially a factor, it's not the direct cause mentioned in the text.
* **C: Vabohiwa kulobye lava nga vaviseka** (Victims being vulnerable) - While the victims were vulnerable, the text identifies the sleeping gas as the weapon used.
* **D: Ndzilo** (The road) - The road is mentioned as the location of the attack, not the cause of the victims falling asleep.



"
"Hi ku ya hi vonelo ra Ali Khamenei, tiko ra Iran ri fanele ri ti ntshuxa eka yini?","The correct answer is **D: Ku tirhisiwa ngopfu ka oyili**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Murhangerikulu wa tiko, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, u hlamusele ku tirhisiwa ngopfu ka oyili tanihi """"ntlhamu"""" ku sukela emahlweni ka hundzuluko wa Vuislamu bya Iran hi 1979 naswona tiko ri fanele ku titshunxa eka swona.""  This translates to: ""The country's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called for the excessive use of oil as """"fuel"""" since the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979 and also that the country should be protected from it.""
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani la nga pfumela leswaku ku yirisiwa ku ni nkucetelo eka ikhonomi ya Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Swihlovo swa mahungu leswi nga le henhla**.

The passage states: ""Tinhlamuselo, leti endliwaka thwii eka thelevhixini, a ku ri ro sungula laha swihlovo swa mahungu swa le Iran swi pfumeleke leswaku ku yirisiwa ku ni nkucetelo.""  This translates to ""News, this is broadcast on television, that the oil sanctions of Iran are expected to ease with the implementation of the agreement.""

While the other options are mentioned, the passage directly states the *oil sanctions of Iran* are expected to ease, implying the *oil producers of Iran* (the oil industry) are hoping for it. Therefore, option A is the most accurate.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xiphemu xa endlelo ra ku vhota e Furwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mabokisi ya tivhoti ma fanele va vonikela**.

Nivusiku, vavhoti va hlayiwa hi vatirhi va ku tirhandzela lava vekiwaka tihlo swinene, ku ri karhi ku landzeriwa maendlelo yo karhi lama vekiweke.""  This implies that the ballot boxes are inspected to ensure the process is correct. The boxes themselves being visible is a key part of that inspection.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vayimeri lava rhumeriwaka hi lava vhoteriwaka:** While voters *can* send in reports, the text doesn't say this *happens* and it's not the main point of what prevents fraud.
* **C: Ku sayina buku ya lava nga vhota:** Signing a book is part of the process, but not the primary element ensuring the integrity of the voting process against fraud.
* **D: Ku hlayiwa ka tivhoti hi vayimeri va lava vhoteriwaka:**  The text says ballot boxes are inspected by *specialized* auditors, not the voters themselves.



"
Hi le kwihi laha lava vhotaka va nga kombisaka munhu loyi a vhoteriwaka loyi va nga nwi hlawula?,"The correct answer is **A: Eka buku ya lava nga vhota**.

The text states: ""Nawu wa minhlawulo wa le Furwa wu hlamusela hi vuenti maendlelo ya kona. Ku sukela hi 1988, mabokisi ya tivhoti ma fanele ma vonikela leswaku vavhoti ni vahlaleri va kota ku vona leswaku a ku hoxiwanga timvhilopo handle ka ta vavhoti lava hlayiweke ni lava pfumeleriweke. **Lava vhoteriwaka va nga rhumela vayimeri leswaku va vona hinkwaswo leswi endliwaka.**""

While voters don't *directly* show the person they voted for, they can verify their vote was recorded by checking the voter registry book.
"
I yini leswi nga endla Allen a sungula vulavisisi bya malembe ya nhungu bya Musashi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku tsakela ka yena ku landzelela mepe wa le lwandle.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loko ku landzelerisiwa mepe wale lwandle ku pfotloka ka xikepe ku kumeke hi ku tirhisa ROV. Un’wana wa vanhu vo fuma swinene laha misaveni, Allen u endle vuvekisi bya rifuwo ro tala ra yena eka vuvalangi bya le matini naswona u sungule riendzo ra yena ro lavisisa Musashi tanihi ku tsakela ka yena ka vutomi enyimpini."" 

This indicates that Allen's investigation into Musashi started *after* the ship's movements were tracked using maps of the ocean.  His motivation was his fascination with Musashi's life and history. Options A and C mention his research, but option B directly connects the *triggering event* (tracking the ship) to his investigation. Option D is also indirectly related, as his fascination stems from Musashi's life in battle, but the immediate cause for starting the investigation is the ship's movement.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Allen u hete nhlayo leyikulu ya mali ya yena eka yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku vuyeteriwa ka Musashi**.

The passage states: ""Loko ku landzelerisiwa mepe wale lwandle ku pfotloka ka xikepe ku kumeke hi ku tirhisa ROV. Un’wana wa vanhu vo fuma swinene laha misaveni, Allen u endle vuvekisi bya rifuwo ro tala ra yena eka vuvalangi bya le matini naswona u sungule riendzo ra yena ro lavisisa Musashi tanihi ku tsakela ka yena ka vutomi enyimpini. **Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, Allen u hete nhlayo leyikulu ya mali ya yena eka yini? Ku vuyeteriwa ka Musashi**"" (After following the charts of the ocean, the ship's progress required the use of a ROV. One of the people who had been highly involved at sea, Allen, made his first attempt at a search in the seabed and also started his work to find Musashi as a result of his longing for a life of adventure. **After a while, Allen spent a large amount of his money on what? It was to find Musashi**).



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi endleke leswaku ku va ni swiyimo swa khombo endzeni ni le kusuhi ka vumaki?","The correct answer is **B: Caesium leyi nga ni miseve ya matimba**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Japanese scientists found caesium with strong radioactive properties and iodine in the wreckage.  It then connects this finding to the possibility that the nuclear reactors may have undergone a meltdown. The passage explicitly mentions the discovery of radioactive caesium.  While the other options are mentioned, the passage directly links the presence of radioactive caesium to the possibility of a meltdown.

Therefore, the answer that directly relates to the cause of the radioactivity and the potential meltdown is **Caesium leyi nga ni miseve ya matimba (Radioactive Caesium)**.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki switsundzuxo swa vuhlayiseki leswi nga ringanyetiwa eka vaaki endzhaku ka xiendlakalo xa le ka vumaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku nga humeli ehandle**.

The text explicitly states that authorities instructed residents not to approach the area and to avoid drinking water from the pumps. While options A, C, and D are mentioned as specific instructions given to residents *during* the incident, the question asks about what happens *after* the incident. The text doesn't explicitly state what happens *after* the incident, but the instruction ""Ku nga humeli ehandle"" (Not to approach the area) implies a continued restriction for safety reasons. It is the most logical and direct consequence mentioned in the text that would likely persist after the initial event.
"
"Hi ku ya hi Dr.Moll, i yini leswi karhataka ngopfu hi XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Nhlayo leyikulu ya vanhu lava faka**.

The text states: ""Dok. Tony Moll u vule leswaku muxaka lowuntshwa a """"wu karhata swinene ni ku chavisa hikwalaho ka nhlayo leyikulu ya vanhu lava faka."""" ""  This directly translates to ""Dr. Tony Moll has stated that the new strain is 'very dangerous and causes a large increase in the illness of people who have infected.'""
"
I vavabyi va ngani lava nga tluleteriwa hi muxaka lowuntshwa lava ku nga tiyisisiwa leswaku i vatirhi va rihanyo?,"The correct answer is **C: 15**.

The passage states: ""Eku heleni ka lembe rin’we, munhu loyi a tluletiweke a nga ha tluleka lava a hlanganaka na vona va 10 ku ya eka 15."" This translates to ""By one day, a person who has been treated may have encountered 10 to 15 of them.""
"
I muxaka muni wa thekinoloji lowu fambiselo ra NextGen ri wu tirhisaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Thekinoloji leyi yi titshegeke hi sathalayiti**.

The passage explicitly states: ""It uses satellite-based technology...""
"
NextGen yi vuyeriwa njhani hi ku kongoma eka swilo leswi lawulaka ku famba ka swihaha-mpfhuka?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindlela to koma ta swihaha-mpfhuka (The way aircraft fly)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen uses satellite-based technology to *monitor how aircraft fly* and then uses radar to identify and track them.  The core of NextGen's impact on emissions is its ability to understand and influence the flight paths of planes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tindhawu leti kongomeke swinene ta swihaha-mpfhuka (The most congested air routes):** While congestion is a factor, the passage emphasizes *how* aircraft fly, not just where.
* **C: Ku hunguteka ka ku humesiwa ka khaboni (Carbon emissions reduction):** This is a result of NextGen, not the method of the change.
* **D: Petiroli leyitsongo (Jet fuel):**  NextGen doesn't directly change the fuel type; it changes the way the fuel is used and how flight paths are managed to minimize emissions.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, van’wamatimu a va solanga FBI hi ku dzika eka yini?","The correct answer is **C: Ku dzika ngopfu eka milandzu ya swifaniso swa vanhu lava kuleke lava nga ambalanga leswaku va navetisa.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the FBI's investigation involved:

*   **""kongomisa switirhisiwa etimhakeni leti swi olovaka ku tiololoxa""** (seizing evidence in locations suspected of drug trafficking)
*   **""ngopfungopfu timhaka ta mimovha leyi yiviweke""** (numerous seized vehicles)
*   **""hi xikongomelo xo pfuna eku humeleleni ka xiyenge lexi tiyimeleke""** (a request for a warrant to search).
*   **""FBI yi fanele yi nyikela vayimeri va 10 ku veka tihlo eka swifaniso swa lava nga ambalangiki swa lava kuleke lava nga ambalanga leswaku va navetisa""** (FBI should deploy 10 agents to stake out suspects who are believed to be drug traffickers)

Option C accurately reflects this description of the FBI's actions regarding suspects and searches of their properties. The other options are not fully supported by the text."
Goza ra leswi yirisiwaka ri sindzisa FBI leswaku yi endla yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Yi kongomisa switirhisiwa eka milandzu ya timovha leti nga yiviwa.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Van’wamatimu va sole tipholisi ta nkarhi lowu hundzeke ta FBI hi ku **kongomisa switirhisiwa etimhakeni leti swi olovaka ku tiololoxa, ngopfungopfu timhaka ta mimovha leyi yiviweke**..."" This directly indicates that the FBI's actions involved seizing evidence from vehicle raids.

While options B, C, and D are related to the investigation, they are not the *primary* action the FBI took, according to the passage. Option A is the most direct and accurate reflection of the FBI's initial actions.
"
Ku endleke yini hi movha wo tima ndzilo lowu a wu ya ku pfuneta eka ku tlumbana ka JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **B: Wu vumbulukile**.

The text states: ""Movha wo tima ndzilo wa le rivaleni ra swihahampfhuka wu vumbulukile loko wu ya eku pfuneni."" which translates to ""The enemy fighter's tail section broke off while approaching for a landing.""
"
"Endzhaku ka ku tlumbana ka JAS 39C Gripen, rivala ra xihaha-mpfhuka ri pfariwile hikwalaho ka yini?","The correct answer is **B: Timovha ta ku tima ndzilo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Swiviko swa vuhaxamahungu swi vula leswaku movha wo tima ndzilo wa le rivaleni ra swihahampfhuka wu vumbulukile loko wu ya eku pfuneni."" This translates to: ""Intelligence reports indicate that the enemy fighter's tail fin was damaged during takeoff.""

Therefore, the enemy fighter crashed due to **damaged tail fin**.
"
Brzezinski u nyike nkongomiso eka mani hi nkarhi wa Hundzuluko wa Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The text states: ""Tanihi NSA, u pfune Carter eku tameleni timhaka misava hi vutswatsi, tanihi Camp David Accords, 1978; a hlela vuxaka exikarhi ka US–China emalembeni ya le ku heleni ka va-1970; Hundzuluko wa Iran, loyi vangeke hasahasa ya mpfalelo wa Iran, hi 1979; swin’we ni ku hlasela ka Soviet le Afghanistan, hi 1979.""

This directly links Brzezinski's role as NSA under Carter to his involvement in navigating the Iran Crisis.  While Kissinger is mentioned as someone Brzezinski later competed with, the question specifically asks who Brzezinski advised *during* the Iran Crisis, and the text explicitly states he advised Carter.
"
I mani la nga tirha eka xiyimo xa National Security Advisor ku fikela hi 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states: ""...a tlhandlama Henry Kissinger.""  This means Kissinger was NSA *before* Brzezinski. The question asks who held the position *until* 1977. The passage doesn't explicitly state who held the position *until* 1977, but it does state that Brzezinski became NSA *in* 1977. Since Kissinger is mentioned as being replaced by Brzezinski, he must have been the NSA before 1977.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga kombisiki hi ku kongoma ku tlanga ka Bobek eka Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **C: U tshama a vhoteriwa tanihi mutlangi wo swikota ngopfu eka matimu ya ntlawa.**

Here's why:

The question asks why Bobek's transfer to Partizan Belgrade is notable *despite* him not breaking the club's scoring record. The text highlights that even though he scored 403 goals (a significant amount), he wasn't the top scorer. However, he was voted the most beloved player at Partizan in 1995. This indicates that his impact on the team went beyond just statistics; he had a strong connection with the fans, which is the reason for his lasting legacy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U howise tibolo ta 468 loko a tlangela ntlawa:** While this is a fact mentioned, it doesn't explain *why* his transfer is notable despite not being the top scorer.
* **B: U howise tibolo to tala ku tlula mutlangi wihi na wihi:** The text explicitly states he *didn't* break the scoring record.
* **D: U tlange ka mintlangu yo tala ku tlula mutlangi wihi ni wihi:**  This refers to his initial years at the club and doesn't connect to the reason for his later recognition.



"
I swiga swihi malunghana ni matimu ya Partizan Belgrade leswi nga ntiyiso?,"The correct answer is **C: U tlangele Partizan ku fikela hi 1995**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""U hlangane na vona hi 1945 naswona u tshame ku fikela 1958. Hi 1995 u hlawuriwe tanihi mutlangi wo swikota ngopfu eka matimu ya Partizan."" (He joined them in 1945 and remained until 1958. In 1995, he was recognized as a very loyal fan of Partizan.)  This means he was a Partizan fan until 1995.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U sungule ku tlangela Partizan hi 1945** - While true, it's not as comprehensive as option C. Option C covers the entire duration of his fandom mentioned in the text.
* **B: U tlangele Zagreb a nga si ya eka Partizan Belgrade** - The text says he was from Zagreb *but* joined Partizan Belgrade.
* **D: U kume ndhuma endzhaku ka ku vhotheriwa tanihi mutlangi wo swikota ngopfu eka Partizan** -  This describes a recognition *in* 1995, not the period of being a fan.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i xihlawulekisi xihi lexi hambanisaka Hesperonychus eka Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Yi na nw’ala lowu kuleke (Its second claw is enlarged)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""N’wala wa yona wa vumbirhi a wu kurile, leswi vangeke leswaku yi thyiwa Hesperonychus leswi vulaka """"n’wala wa le vupeladyambu""""."" This translates to: ""Its second claw was enlarged, which is why it wasn't called Hesperonychus, which means 'evening predator'.""

The passage also mentions the resemblance to Velociraptor: ""...ya ngati yo hisa a ku pfumeriwa leswaku yi tshame yi famba hi milenge yimbirhi naswona yi ri ni min’wala yo fana na Velociraptor."" (...it is suggested that it walked on two legs and also had claws similar to Velociraptor.)

Therefore, the enlarged second claw is the key distinguishing feature mentioned in the text.
"
Nhlamuselo ya “Hesperonychus” yi huma eka xihlawulekisi xihi xa miri wa swivumbiwa?,"The correct answer is **A: N’wala kumbe min’wala (Claws or talons)**.

The passage states: ""N’wala wa yona wa vumbirhi a wu kurile, leswi vangeke leswaku yi thyiwa Hesperonychus leswi vulaka """"n’wala wa le vupeladyambu."""""" which translates to ""Its second claw was large, which is why it was not called Hesperonychus, which means 'evening claw'.""

Therefore, the name ""Hesperonychus"" refers to its claws.
"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ntiyiso malungana ni ku duvuriwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Vatekani va tekane hi lembe leri hundzeke e Buffalo.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Vatekani va tekane eTexas eka lembe leri hundzeke naswona va ye eBuffalo kuya tlangela na vanghana ni maxaka."" (The partners traveled to Texas on the day the earthquake happened and also went to Buffalo to meet with various people.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nuna na nsati va ri vambirhi a va huma e Texas:** The passage mentions the husband and wife *traveling* to Buffalo, not leaving Texas.
* **B: A ku ri ni lava hlaseriweke va ntlhanu:** The passage doesn't mention the number of people injured.
* **D: Ku duvuriwa ku humelele e Buffalo:** While the earthquake happened in Texas and they went to Buffalo, the passage doesn't say the earthquake *occurred* in Buffalo.



"
I swiga swihi leswi nga kongoma malunghana ni laha ku duvuriwa ku nga humelela kona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku humelele eka xiendlakalo xa ximfumo xa xitsundzuxo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nkhuvo wa ximfumo wa xitsundzuxo xa vukati xi vekeriwe eka masiku lama nga ta landzela, varhangeri va vurile."" This translates to ""The outline of the investigation into the central accident was laid out in the following days, investigators reported.""

Therefore, the accident and the investigation are linked to the ""xiendlakalo xa ximfumo xa xitsundzuxo"" which means ""the scene of the accident investigation"".  Options A and C are incorrect because they refer to the location of the investigation, not the event itself. Option D is too broad.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini swa ku sungula leswi nga karhata valawuri malunghana ni Luno?","The correct answer is **D: Ku vaviseka loku swi kotekaka leswaku swi nga humelela eka swirho swa ntlawa.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Luno a yi ri na 120–160 cubic metres ya mafurwa loko yi tshoveka na mimoya leyi baka ngopfu na magandlati lama yisiweke eka khumbi ro ya sivela. Swihaha mpfhuka swi ponise khume mbirhi wa swirho swa ntlawa naswona ku tshoveke nhompfu ntsena.""

This translates to: ""Luno has 120–160 cubic meters of smoke when it travels with heavy smoke and suspended particles in the exhaust. The exhaust fumes contain twice as much particulate matter and also spread into the air.""

The passage then goes on to say that a 100-meter ship entered the path to collect samples and alert passengers to the speed. This implies a dangerous situation has arisen due to the smoke and particulate matter. The reason for this dangerous situation is that the smoke is considered hazardous and could potentially affect the particulate matter, leading to a dangerous outcome for passengers and Luno.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku pfumala ka ndzhwalo wa manyoro** - ""The formation of light fumes"" - The passage describes *heavy* smoke, not light fumes.
*   **B: Mimoya leyi baka ngopfu na magandlati** - ""Heavy smoke and particles"" - This is a *cause* of the problem, not what *started* it. The smoke and particles are already present.
*   **C: Ku halaka ka mafurha** - ""The speed of the smoke"" - The passage mentions the speed but doesn't say it *started* the problem.

Therefore, option D accurately captures the underlying reason for the hazardous situation – the potential danger posed by the smoke and its interaction with the particulate matter.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka malunghana ni ku tshoveka ka Luno leswi nga riki ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tshoveka ku humelele ku nga si landziwa ndzhwalo** (The weather was unpredictable and not monitored).

Here's why:

* The question asks what *could have caused* the unexpected turbulence and Luno's erratic flight.
* The text states that Luno encountered strong winds and ice on the wing. 
* The text also mentions a 100-meter ship was gathering data because passengers were reporting turbulence. 
* The phrase ""Ku tshoveka ku humelele ku nga si landziwa ndzhwalo"" suggests that the unexpected turbulence might have been due to weather conditions that were not accurately predicted or monitored, leading to the flight's issues. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xikepe a xi ri ni 100 wa timithara ta mafurha hi nkarhi wa ku tshoveka** (The ship was 100 meters long at the time of the turbulence) - The text confirms the ship's length, but not its relationship to the turbulence. It's an irrelevant detail to the cause.
* **C: Eka swirho swa ntlawa swa lava nga khume-mbirzhi, i un’we la nga vaviseka** (Among the ice, one piece could have broken off) - While ice could cause problems, the text doesn't specifically say a piece broke off and caused the turbulence.
* **D: Xikepe xi bakanyiriwile eka khumbi ro sivela** (The ship collided with the emerging cloud) - The text mentions the ship was gathering data *because* of the turbulence, suggesting it wasn't involved in the turbulence itself.



"
Hi le ka khume ra malembe wahi laha Algeria yi nga kuma ntshunxeko?,"The correct answer is **C: Hi va 1960**.

The text states: ""Eka va 1960 u vuyele eAlgeria leyi a yi ya ha ku kuma ntshuxeko..."" which translates to ""In 1960 he went to Algeria which was about to gain independence...""
"
Hi le kwihi laha a ku nga vekiwanga swikrini swa thelevhixini ku kombisa nkosi?,"The correct answer is **D: Eka St. Peter’s Square**.

The text states: ""Emadorebenikulu yo tala ya le Italy ni le ka misava hinkwayo, mahlelelo lama fanaka ma endliwile, laha swi hlaleriweke hi nhlayo leyikulu ya vanhu."" This means similar arrangements happened in churches around the world, including St. Peter's Square. However, it also says: ""ku pfumelela vanhu ku hlalela xiendlakalo lexi,"" which implies screens were placed *outside* of St. Peter's Square so people could watch.

Option A is incorrect because the text states screens were placed in Rome. Option B is incorrect because while screens were placed in various Italian cities, the question asks where they were *not* placed. Option C is incorrect because the text says the arrangements happened in churches around the world, including St. Peter's Square, not specifically in Poland.
"
Hi le kwihi laha nkosi wu nga khomeriwa kona?,"The correct answer is **C: Eka St. Peter’s Square**.

The passage states: ""Nhlayo ya vanhu lava a va ri kona a yi ri yikulu swinene lerova a swi kotekanga leswaku hinkwavo va nghena enkosini le St. Peter's Square."" (The joy of the people who were there was very great because they did not expect to enter the presence of the Lord in St. Peter's Square.)

While the event was broadcast throughout Rome and other locations, the specific place where people gathered to experience the presence of the leader was St. Peter's Square.
"
"Endzhaku ka ku buluka, i va mani lava nga tshunguriwa ku vaviseka?","The correct answer is **A: Kwalomu ka vanhu va ntlhanu**.

The text explicitly states: ""A ku vikiwangi ku vaviseka, kambe kwalomu ka vanhu va ntlhanu lava a va ri kwalaho loko ku buluka va tshunguriwe eka swikombiso swa ku chava."" which translates to ""There was no rescue, but of the five people who were injured when the house collapsed, five were rescued.""
"
I mani la nga vika ku pfuta ka gasi?,"The correct answer is **A: Muakelani la tshamaka eka muako** (The tenant who was in the house).

The passage states: ""...mutirhi wa ximfumo wa khamphani ya gasi u fikile eka mhangu endzhaku ka loko muakelani a be riqhingho hikwalaho ko pfuta ka gasi."" (The gas company's technician arrived at the back of the house after the tenant had a problem with a gas leak.)
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i vanhu va ngani lava feke eka ku hlaseriwa?","The correct answer is **C: 5**.

The text states: ""Tlhari ra Uka ri tsandzekile tanihi leswi a ri kongomisiwe eka nhloko ya wanuna **wa vuntlhanu**."" (The Uka tribe was grateful for the things requested for the head of **a father of five**.) This indicates that Kristoffer Schneider is the father of five children.
"
I tlhari ra mani leri nga tsandzeka ku duvula hi nkarhi wa ku hlaseriwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The text states: ""Tlhari ra Uka ri tsandzekile tanihi leswi a ri kongomisiwe eka nhloko ya wanuna wa vuntlhanu."" This translates to ""The Army's efforts are focused on the head of a five-star general.""  The Army (Uka) is the entity that is focused on the situation.
"
I mintlangu yihi eka leyi landzelaka leyi nga vhoteriwa ku huma eka nongonoko wa ti Olimpiki?,"The correct answer is **A: Swikwaxi**.

The text states: ""Sikwaxi, Karati, na mintlangu yo rhendzeleka swi ringetile ku nghena eka Tiolimpiki na baseball na sofball, leswi susiweke eka Mintlangu Ya Olimpiki hi 2005.""

This indicates that gymnastics (Swikwaxi) is among the sports that are *in* the Olympics, and therefore not among those being considered for removal. The question asks which sports might be voted out. The options listed that are *not* being discussed as potential removals are Rugby and Baseball. 

The question is tricky because it's phrased to ask about sports *being voted out*, but the text doesn't explicitly state that any sports are being voted out *at this moment*. It discusses sports that are *being considered* for removal. However, based on the provided options and the context of the text, gymnastics is the only one explicitly mentioned as having been *considered* for removal in the past (but is currently included).
"
I mintlangu yihi eka leyi landzelaka leyi Komiti Ya Tiolimpiki Ta Matiko yi nga vhotela leswaku yi katsiwa eka mintlangu?,"The correct answer is **A: Mintlangu yo tirhisa swa ku rhendzeleka**.

The text states: ""Sikwaxi, Karati, na mintlangu yo rhendzeleka swi ringetile ku nghena eka Tiolimpiki na baseball na sofball...""  This indicates that gymnastics, karate, and sports involving skills (which translates to ""mintlangu yo rhendzeleka"" in the provided context) were chosen.
"
Arthur Guinness emasungulweni u hirhise St James’ Gate Brewery hi malembe mangani?,"The correct answer is **C: 1759**.

The question asks when Arthur Guinness *established* the brewery. The text states he signed a 9,000-year lease in 1759.  Therefore, 1759 is when he established the brewery.
"
Hi kwalomu ka tidolara tingani ta tibiliyoni leti Guinness yi ti nghenisaka hi lembe?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**

The text states that Guinness has generated over **10 trillion** US dollars in revenue over the 250 years. The question asks for the amount in trillions, which is 10.
"
Hi le ka matiko mangani lama nga eka Yuniyoni ya Yuropa laha xitsongwatsongwana xa H5N1 xi nga kumiwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ya Ntlhanu (Five)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Furwa i tiko ra vunkombo ematikweni lama nga ehansi ka Ntwanano wa Yuropa leri hlaseriweke hi xitsongwatsongwana lexi; ri landzela Austria, Jarimani, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece na Italy.""  This translates to ""Furwa is a region of avian influenza outbreaks following the outbreak in Europe; it follows Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy.""  Counting those countries, there are five.
"
Hi le kwihi la ku nga va ni xiviko xa le ndzhaku xa ku kumiwa ka xitsongwatsongwana xa H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: E Furwa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Muxaka wa mukhuhlwana wa tinyenyana lowu nga ni khombo eka vanhu, ku nga H5N1, ku tiyisekisiwe leswaku wu tlulele sekwa ra le khwatini leri feke, leri kumiweke hi Musumbhunuku, endhawini ya nhlangasi ekusuhi ni le Lyon evuxeni bya Furwa."" This translates to: ""The outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza, such as H5N1, has been confirmed to have originated from a contaminated batch of poultry, which was seized by authorities in the Rhône region of Lyon, France.""

While other countries are mentioned as having H5N1 outbreaks, France (specifically Lyon) is identified as the origin of *this* particular outbreak.
"
Haiti yi hetelele rini ku va ni swiphiqo swa vuvabyi ku nga si hangalaka vuvabyi lebyi nga tisiwa hi vanhu vo tisa kurhula?,"The correct answer is **A: Hi 1800**.

The passage states: ""Haiti a yi nga si tshama yi va na swiphiqo swa vuvabyi ku sukela kwalomu ka va 1800."" (Haiti has not had a stable government since the 1800s.)
"
I thyaka leri humaka eka ndhawu yihi leri nga hoxa xandla eka ku hangalaka ka vuvabyi?,"The correct answer is **A: Eka Nambu wa Artibonite**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Hikuya hi vanhu va nawu, thyaka ra ti kampa ta UN ari nga basisiwanga kahle, ri endle leswaku switsongwatsongwana swi nghena eka xitsundzuxo xa Artibonite River,yin’wana ya minkova leyikulu eHaiti.""  This directly links the flooding to the Artibonite River.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Etikampeni ta masocha ya le UN:** While the UN peacekeeping campaign is mentioned as having shortcomings, the text points to the river as the specific location of the flooding.
*   **C: Ndhawu leyi ku nga tsekatseka misava kona hi 2010:** This is too general. The text pinpoints the Artibonite River.
*   **D: Nhlangano ya Vululami na Demokhrasi ya le Haiti:** This organization conducted studies *about* the issues, but didn't cause the flooding itself.



"
Mfumo wa le Ireland wu kunguhata ku endla yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku simeka milawu yo tika leyi engetelekeke eka ku pfumeleriwa ka swidzidziharisi.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Irish government believes the parliament should ""swiftly rectify"" the issue. The problem is the misuse of ""aggressive"" or ""harmful"" technologies.
* The passage mentions a ""human survey"" and ""surveys of technology users and their negative experiences.""
* It further states that laws are being changed ""to align with what was deemed to be harmful and to enable the technology to function."" This implies the government is creating new, stricter laws to regulate and potentially restrict the use of these technologies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku nyika lava tirhisaka swidzidziharisi milandzu** (Providing technology users with licenses):  The passage focuses on *regulating* the technology, not just licensing users.
* **C: Ku olovisa milawu ya ku pfumeleriwa ka swidzidziharisi** (Repealing laws on technology use): The passage indicates the opposite - *new* laws are being implemented.
* **D: Ku endla swidzidzisi swi va enawini** (Making technologies profitable): The passage doesn't discuss profitability; it's focused on the harmful effects of the technology.



"
I yini leyi a yi pfumeleriwa hi nawu hi xinkarhana le Ireland?,"The correct answer is **B: Vukanganyisi (Discrimination)**.

The text states: ""Mfumo lowu wa le Ireland wu tshikilela leswaku vumbiwa bya palamendhe byi fanele byi lunghisa mhaka leyi hi ku hatlisa. **Sweswi i swa nkoka eka havumbirhi ka vutshunguri bya vanhu hinkwavo ni ndlela leyi vululami byi yi vonaka ha yona leswaku nawu lowu wu tirhisiwa hi ku hatlisa**...""

This clearly indicates that the system in Ireland is being criticized for discrimination. The mention of ""havumbirhi ka vutshunguri bya vanhu hinkwavo"" translates to ""lack of equality for people of different backgrounds,"" which is a key component of discrimination.
"
Muhehliwa wu le ku kambisisiweni hikwalaho ka yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku nghena emutini wa un’wana handle ka mpfumelelo**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""muhehliwa waxinuna u le ku kambisisiweni hikwalaho ka nandzu wo nghena emutini wa un’wana handle ka mpfumelelo ematshan’weni ya nandzu wo onha nhundzu."" This translates to ""the editor was arrested due to a drug offense of entering another person's home in pursuit of a drug deal.""
"
"Loko a cinca mfungho, i yini leswi muhehliwa a nga swi endla?","The correct answer is **D: U tirhise ti tarpaulin ku wu cinca**

The passage explicitly states: ""Mfungho a wu onhiwanga; wu lunghisiwile hi ku tirhisa titarpaulin ta ntima leti khavisiweke hi mimfungho ya ku rhula ni mbilu leswaku ku cinciwa “O” yi va “e” lontsongo.""  This translates to: ""The question was not answered; it was corrected using heavy tarpaulins that were covered with calming questions and a mosquito net so that the ""O"" was changed to ""e"" in the word.""

Therefore, the editor used tarpaulins to change the letter.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi mudyondzisi wa Xinghezi Karno a nga hehliwanga hi swona?","The correct answer is **A: Ku nga landzeleli milawu yo sirhelela swa vutsari (Failing to follow veterinary regulations)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku tlhele a hehliwa hi ku nga landzeleli milawu yo sirhelela swa vutsari, kambe a a nga gweviwangi."" (He was repeatedly reprimanded for failing to follow veterinary regulations, but he wasn't held accountable.)

While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are not the reason he wasn't held accountable. The passage directly links his reprimands to the failure to follow veterinary regulations.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi a nga tlhakisiwanga hi Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **A: Vapfhumba (Civilians)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rolando Mendoza u duvule vapfhumba hi xibamu xakwe xa M16."" This translates to ""Rolando Mendoza shot civilians with his M16 rifle.""  The passage also mentions ""Vanhu vo hlayanyana lava tlhakisiweke"" which means ""innocent people who were shot.""  Therefore, the people shot were civilians.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maphorisa (Police):** The text mentions a police officer (Rolando Mendoza) who shot civilians, not that the police were shot.
*   **C: Vana (Children):** While children were among the victims, the text refers to the victims generally as ""civilians"".
*   **D: Lava tekaka swifaniso (Journalists):** The text mentions journalists were traveling with the civilians but doesn't state that they were specifically shot.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, eka lava tlhakisiweke i vahi lava a ku nga tiyisisiwanga leswaku va ntshunxiwe ku nga si fika nkarhi?","The correct answer is **A: Vapfhumba (The hostages)**.

The passage states: ""Vanhu va tsevu lava tlhakisiweke, lava katsaka vana ni vanhu lavakulu va ntshunxiwe ku nga si fika nkarhi, ku fana ni vateki va swinepe vale Fillipino.""  This translates to: ""The injured hostages, including children and elderly people, were not picked up on time, along with the Filipino caterers.""

Therefore, the hostages are the ones who were not picked up on time.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani la nga hlengeleta minsayino ya ku seketela ku endla vukati bya vanhu va rimbewu rin’we byi va enawini le Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Vakombisakuvilela (The Representatives)**.

The text states: ""Vakombisakuvilela va tshemba leswaku va ta hlengeleta xikombelo xa vona xa minsayino ya 1.2 miliyoni ku xi yisa eka Huvo ya Tiko hi Hukuri."" which translates to ""The Representatives hoped to get their petition of 1.2 million signatures to the Catholic Church at the highest level.""

Therefore, the representatives are the ones trying to get the signatures to the Catholic Church.
"
Vakombisakuvilela va ta nyika mani xikombelo xa vona?,"The correct answer is **C: Huvo ya Tiko ya Brazil**.

The passage states: ""Vakombisakuvilela va tshemba leswaku va ta hlengeleta xikombelo xa vona xa minsayino ya 1.2 miliyoni ku xi yisa eka Huvo ya Tiko hi Hukuri.""  This translates to: ""The proponents hoped to get their petition of 1.2 million signatures to the Catholic Church of Brazil.""



"
"Hi ku ya hi xiviko xa Armand Versace, i yini leswi nga humelela hi ku kongoma vanhu va nga si sungula ku angula eka maxelo?","The correct answer is **A: Ku sungule xihangu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after the wind started, and after the rain started, ""ndzhaku ka sweswo ku sungula xihangu, vanhu va chuwile naswona va huwelela va tsustsuma eka ndhawu hinkwayo.""  This translates to: ""Subsequently, the wind started, people got scared and started running to a different place.""

The passage explicitly links the *start of the wind* to people becoming frightened and fleeing.  While the other options mention events that happened, the wind starting is the most direct cause mentioned for the panic and fleeing.

Therefore, the answer is A.
"
"Hi ku ya hi Versace, mimoya leyikulu swinene yi sungule rini?","The correct answer is **A: Timinete to hlayanyana endzhaku ka nkombiso** (Few minutes after the demonstration).

The text states: ""Eka timinete ta ntlhanu ta ku kombisa ku sungula ka moya lowukulu..."" which translates to ""Few minutes after the demonstration, the strong wind started...""
"
"Emahlweni ka Fred, i mabubutsa mangani lama nga rhekhodiwa evuxeni bya 35°W?","The text states that Fred is a significant tropical cyclone that reached a maximum wind speed of 105 mph and was located at 35°W. The question asks how many other cyclones were recorded at 35°W.

The text **doesn't provide information about other cyclones recorded at 35°W.** It only describes Fred. Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Rin’we** (One). The text implies that Fred is the only one specifically mentioned in relation to that longitude.
"
"Loko Fred yi ri ekusuhi ni swihlala swa le Cape Verde, xana a yi kongome ka tlhelo rihi?","The correct answer is **D: En’walungu vupeladyambu**.

The passage states: ""Fred i kongome en’walungu vupeladyambu."" which translates to ""Fred made landfall in the Atlantic.""  This directly answers the question of where Fred made landfall.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga ni rivilo swinene ku tlula xo sungula?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The question states that 802.11n is the first standard to exceed the 600Mbit/s throughput.  Therefore, 802.11n is the reason for the improved performance.
"
I yini lexi lavekaka leswaku 802.11n yi fambisana ku tlhelela endzhaku na 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **A: Rivilo lerikulu swinene (Significant improvement)**.

Here's why:

* **802.11n represents a significant technological advancement over older standards like 802.11b.** While 802.11n is backward compatible, the core improvement lies in its speed and efficiency.
* **802.11b operates on 2.4 GHz, which is more prone to interference.** 802.11n leverages both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, offering less congested channels and higher speeds.
* **While 600Mbit/s is a speed, it's a *result* of the improvements in 802.11n, not the reason it's backward compatible.**
* **802.11b cannot operate on 5.0 GHz.** This statement is incorrect.

Therefore, the primary reason 802.11n is backward compatible with older standards is because it represents a **significant improvement** in the wireless technology. It maintains compatibility to ensure existing devices can still connect, but the real benefit is the substantial speed increase and improved performance.



"
Hi le ka swiendlakalo swingani laha nhenha ya ti Olimpiki leyi kumeke ti medali ta nsuku a yi fanele yi ya hlambela eka Mintlango ya Commonwealth?,"The correct answer is **C: Swimbirhi (Two)**.

The question states the athlete won medals at the Commonwealth Games but was disqualified from the Olympics due to doping. Therefore, the events they competed in at the Commonwealth Games were two events - 100m and 200m freestyle.
"
Ha yini nhenha ya ti Olimpiki leyi kumeke ti medali ta nsuku a yi nga swi koti ku nwa maphilisi ya xona hikwalaho ka xitlhavi?,"The correct answer is **C: A karhateka hileswaku ma ta khumba ku faneleka ka miri wa yena hi ndlela yo biha.**

Here's why:

The question states that the athlete is refusing to take performance-enhancing drugs (implied by ""maphilisi lama lavekaka leswaku a ta hlula xitlhavi"") because they are concerned about the integrity of their results and the potential consequences of being caught. This aligns with option C, which describes a concern about the fairness of achieving success through illegitimate means.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: A nga ri xitlhavi xihi kumbe xihi (It's nothing or something):** This is too vague and doesn't address the athlete's motivation.
* **B: A ma n’wi vabyisa (It makes him sick):** While possible, the text focuses on the ethical concern rather than physical discomfort.
* **D: A swi pfumeleriwanga hi Mintlangu ya Commonwealth (It's not allowed by the Commonwealth Games):** While true, the text implies a deeper ethical concern beyond just breaking a rule.  The athlete is concerned about the implications *of* using drugs, not just that it's prohibited.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i yini leswi nga ha va ka swi vange ku pfilunganyeka malunghana ni xiendlakalo xa ku tsekatseka ka misava?","The correct answer is **A: Ku va kona ka mapapa ya munyama**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mapapa ya munyama lama nga fambisaniki na vholkheno ya voniwile emasungulweni ya ntshava."" (Satellite images of the volcano were visible in the mountains). This indicates that satellite imagery was used to monitor the eruption and track the activity.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Swiviko ku huma eka Hofisi ya ta Maxelo eIceland (Flights were cancelled by the Icelandic Meteorological Office):** While flights may have been cancelled, the passage doesn't directly link the cancellations to something *not* being coordinated. It just mentions the Meteorological Office wasn't cancelling flights.
* **C: Mepe wa matiko wa ku tsekatseka ka misava (Volcanic eruption maps):**  The passage mentions maps *of* the eruption, not that the maps themselves were uncoordinated.
* **D: Xiendlakalo lexi nga vikiwa eka tindhawu tin’wana ta Iceland (This event was visible in other parts of Iceland):** The passage states the eruption was visible in the mountains, but doesn't say it was visible *everywhere* in Iceland, and the question asks what wasn't coordinated in relation to the eruption itself.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ku cinca lokukulu ku humelele rini?","The correct answer is **C: Hi March 10**.

The text states: ""Ku tseka tseka ka misava loku ku tiseke ku cinca lokukulu ku endleke hi March 10..."" which translates to ""The eruption is expected to occur on March 10th...""
"
I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka malunghana na xilo lexi xa ku ya en’wetini xa Chandrayaan-1 leswi nga riki ntiyiso?,"The correct answer is **A: Xitirhisiwa xa ku rhendzeleka n’weti xi fambise xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini na ntlawa**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Handle ka ku rhwala switirhisiwa swa sayense, switirhisiwa swa ku ya en’wetini a swi rhwale na xifaniso xa mujeko wa le Indiya, lowu a wu pendiwe matlhelo hinkwawo.""  This indicates that the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) successfully collected data and images of the Moon.

Option A accurately reflects this by saying the impact probe transmitted data and images.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini a xi ri na switirhisiwa swa nkoka:** While it's true the probe had necessary instruments, the text doesn't emphasize this as a key outcome.
*   **C: Ku huma ka xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini ku fambe kahle:** The text explicitly mentions the probe *impacted* the Moon.  ""Fambe kahle"" (went well) is too general and doesn't reflect the impact aspect.
*   **D: Xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini a xi pendiwile ematlhelweni:** The text states images were collected, but it doesn't specifically mention data being analyzed in detail (""ematlhelweni"").

I swiga swihi eka leswi landzelaka leswi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini?,"The correct answer is **A: Xi fike kahle ekusuhi na nsika ya le n’walungu wa N’weti (It landed safely on the lunar surface)**.

The question states that the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) successfully impacted the Moon and transmitted scientific data and images back to Earth. Option A accurately reflects this successful outcome.

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **B: Ku tlumbetiwa ka xona ku ve loku humelelaka (It was suspected to have crashed):** The text explicitly states it landed safely.
*   **C: Xi humesiwe eka xitirhisiwa xa ku ya en’wetini leswi nga ni ntlawa wa vanhu (It was detached from the lander with human crew):** The MIP was a probe, not part of the lander with a human crew.
*   **D: A xi rhwale switirhisiwa swimbirhi swa nkoka (It transmitted two important instruments):** The text mentions it transmitted scientific data and images, but not specifically two ""important instruments."" While it did transmit data, the specific number of instruments is not stated.

"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i magoza mahi ya nsirhelelo lama nga ta tirhisiwa ra ku hetelela ku lwisana ni vuvabyi?","The correct answer is **A: Swodlaya switsotswana (Mosquito nets)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hulumendhe ya le India yi teka magoza ya leswaku ku khomiwa hi tinguluve etindhawini leti tluletiweke swinene, ku aviwa magidi ya tinete ta tinsuna ni **swodlaya switsotswana**.""  This directly translates to the government taking measures to control mosquitoes in these areas, distributing millions of mosquito nets and mosquito repellents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vakhomi va tinguluve (Mosquito repellents):** While mosquito repellents are mentioned, ""swodlaya switsotswana"" is a more comprehensive and direct answer based on the actions taken by the government.
* **C: Mintlhavelo ya encephalitis yo sivela mavabyi (Mosquito-borne encephalitis):**  The passage discusses the *impact* of mosquito-borne encephalitis (illness), but it doesn't describe it as a *solution* or *measure* to fight mosquitoes.
* **D: Tinete ta tinsuna (Mosquito nets):**  Mosquito nets are *part* of the solution, but ""swodlaya switsotswana"" is a broader term encompassing a more complete approach to protection.



"
Vuvabyi byi tlulela njhani eka vanhu?,"The correct answer is **B: Swodlaya switsotswana**.

The text states: ""Mavabyi ma hundzelaka eka vanhu ku ya fika eka tinsuna."" which translates to ""The migrants were found at the slums going to the slums."" Therefore, the migrants ended up in slums/slums.
"
Ku tsandzeka ka xigwevo xa vumbirhi ku nga va ni vuyelo byihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku kambisisiwa hi xihatla ka HJR-3**.

The passage states: ""Loko ku landzeriwa fambiselo, HJR-3 yi ta tlhela yi kambisisiwa hi nawu lowu nga ta hlawuriwa hi 2015 kumbe 2016 leswaku yi ta tshama yi ri kona."" This directly indicates that the bill HJR-3 is being introduced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku kuma mfanelo eka vumundzuku ya ti yuniyoni leti yimelaka ku hlangana ka rimbewu leri fanaka hi swa masangu:** While the bill *could* potentially affect unions, the passage doesn't state that seeking approval from unions is a requirement for introducing the bill.
* **C: Eka nhlangano wa ku veka milawu wa xihatla:**  The passage mentions the bill being introduced, but doesn't explicitly say it's being introduced in a legislative body.
* **D: Ku yirisiwa ka ti yuniyoni leti yimelaka ku hlangana ka rimbewu leri fanaka hi swa masangu:** The passage discusses how the bill might impact unions, but doesn't say it involves using or employing unions.



"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, ha yini xigwevo xa vumbirhi xi susiwile?","The correct answer is **B: Hi 2011**.

The passage states: ""Ku lunghisiwa loku ringanyetiweke ku pasise tiyindlu hatimbirhi hi 2011."" This translates to ""The bill was passed by both houses in 2011.""
"
I mani loyi ku nga paluxiwa “Panama Papers” eka yena?,"The correct answer is **A: Khamphani ya Mossack Fonseca**.

The text states that the ""Panama Papers"" were leaked from the law firm Mossack Fonseca. While the papers exposed various individuals and entities, the source of the leak was the firm itself.
"
"Hi ku ya hi ndzimana, i mani loyi swihaxa mahungu swa le Britain swi nga vula leswaku a fambisa tikhamphani to tala ku tumbeta rifuwo?","The correct answer is **A: Vatirhisi lava fuweke va tibangi to hambana (The implicated parties)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the Panama Papers revealed that many wealthy individuals were using offshore companies to avoid taxes. 
* It also mentions that the Guardian newspaper reported on Deutsche Bank's involvement with thousands of shell companies.
* The question asks *who* was revealed to be using these companies to evade taxes. 

Therefore, the answer is not a specific entity like the Panama company or Deutsche Bank. It's the *individuals* who were revealed to be using the companies for tax evasion. Option A, ""Vatirhisi lava fuweke va tibangi to hambana,"" best captures this meaning.



The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Khamphani ya ta nawu ya le Panama (The Panama Company):** While Mossack Fonseca was central to the scandal, the question asks *who* was using the companies.
* **C: Bangi ya Deutsche (Deutsche Bank):** Deutsche Bank was implicated in facilitating the use of shell companies, but the question asks about *who* was evading taxes, not about the bank's actions.
* **D: Mfumo wa Pakistan (The Pakistani Government):** The Pakistani government was mentioned as being involved with the Panama Papers, but the question asks about the individuals using offshore companies for tax evasion.

I tinghozi tihi ta swihaha-mpfhuka eka leti landzelaka laha ku feke vanhu vo tala?,"The correct answer is **A: Nghozi ya xihaha-mpfhuka lexi a xi ya le Armenia xi suka eIran.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""N’weti leyi hundzeke Iran ri vone ngozi leyi tekeke malembe loko xihaha mpfhuka lexi a xiya eArmenia xi wa..."" (The wave that happened in Iran saw the danger that occurred for years when the gas leak hit Armenia...).  This directly links the gas leak in Armenia to originating in Iran.
* Option C is incorrect because the passage indicates the Armenia incident *originated* in Iran.
* Option B is incorrect as the passage specifies the leak was a *gas* leak (xihaha mpfhuka).
* Option D is partially correct (the Mashhad leak *is* a gas leak), but it doesn't address the origin of the danger presented in the question. The question asks about the danger presented to the *first* people affected.
"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki xivangelo xa ku tala ka tinghozi ta swihaha-mpfhuka leti nga humelela le Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Milawu yo xupula ya matiko leyi nga tiyisekisa leswaku swihaha-mpfhuka leswintshwa a swi nge xaviwi.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Milawu yo xupula ya matiko yi tiyisekise leswaku swihaha mpfuka leswi ntswha a swi nge xaviwi."" (Extensive laws have confirmed that new, explosive weapons are not allowed.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Swihaha mpfhuka swa khale swo famba hi vanhu ni swa nyimpi:** While mentioned as a historical context, it doesn't explain *why* the current situation is dangerous.
* **B: Ku pfumaleka ka mali ya ku pfumelela ku xaviwa ka swihaha-mpfhuka leswintshwa:** The passage doesn't mention any funding or money related to new weapons.
* **D: Ku nga hlayisiwi kahle ka swihaha-mpfhuka:** The passage describes dangerous incidents, not a lack of proper handling.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga katsiwanga eka xiviko xa Iraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **D: Xikombelo xa ku simekiwa ka ntwanano eUnited States.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Xiviko xi rhanga hi xikombelo xo va ni nkanerisano wa mani na mani hi ku simekiwa ka ntwanano eUnited States malunghana ni pholisi ku ya eMiddle East."" (The group focused on a recommendation to have consultations with all parties to establish dialogue between the United States and police going to the Middle East.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ku xopaxopiwa ka pholisi leyi nga kona** - While the group considered the presence of police, it wasn't the primary recommendation.
*   **B: Xitiviso xa ku ri loko ku ri ni ku cinca kun’wana, madzolonga lama engetelekaka le Iraq ma nga papalatiwa** - This is a consequence *mentioned* in the passage (potentially reducing insurgents), but not a core recommendation.
*   **C: Swibumabumelo swa ku sirhelela mindzilakana ya Iraq** - This is another consequence *mentioned*, but not the main recommendation.

Therefore, **D** best reflects a central point of the Iraq Study Group's recommendations as outlined in the text."
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga khuthaziwi hi Iraq Study Group eka xiviko xa yona?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku simekiwa ka goza lerintshwa ra vudipulomatiki**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Xo sungula eka swibumabumelo swa 78 hi leswaku ku fanele ku tekiwa goza lerintshwa ra vudipulomati ku nga si hela lembe ku sirhelela mindzilakana ya Iraq eka minhlaselo yo biha ni ku simeka vuntshwa vuxaka bya vudipulomati ni vaakelani va rona."" (Starting with 78 recommendations, it is deemed necessary to pursue a new diplomatic course to quickly resolve Iraq's conflicts and establish dialogue between diplomats and their counterparts.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku nga vuriwa xitiyisekiso xa ku heta madzolonga lama engetelekaka:** While avoiding further casualties is a *goal* of the recommendations, the passage doesn't say it's a *guarantee* or the primary action being pushed.
* **B: Ku cinca nkongomiso hi xihatla:**  The passage calls for a *new* diplomatic *course*, which is a more deliberate and strategic shift than a sudden change of direction.
* **C: Ku tirhisa nkanerisano wa mani na mani:** While engaging with a broad range of stakeholders is mentioned, the core recommendation revolves around diplomacy.



"
"Hi ku ya hi maphorisa, i mani la nga tekiwa tanihi xandla xa Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text states: ""Maphorisa ma vule leswaku Lo Piccolo a ri na matimba swinene hikuva a a ri xandla xa Provenzano le Palermo..."" which translates to ""Police revealed that Lo Piccolo was very powerful because he was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo...""
"
"Hi ku ya hi rungula leri nga nyikeriwa eka ndzimana, a ku ri yini xivangelo xa ku fa ka Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: U dlayiwile hi nkarhi wa nyimpi leyi a yi hlohloteriwa hi Riina**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mfumo leyi tekeke vutomi bya valweri va Mafia ku nga Giovanni Falcone na Paolo Borsellino **hi1992**.""  The context implies Falcone and Borsellino were killed during the conflicts/wars (nyimpi) orchestrated by Riina and Provenzano.  The phrase ""hi1992"" directly links their deaths to this conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U dlayiwile hi maphorisa:** While police were involved, the text focuses on the conflicts *caused by* the Mafia bosses.
* **C: Lo Picollo u rhumeriwe leswaku a n’wi dlaya:** This is not mentioned in the text.
* **D: U dlayiwile hi mulweri kulobye wa yena wa ri Mafia ku nga Paolo Borsellino:**  While Borsellino was a Mafia figure, the text says Falcone and Borsellino were killed by the Mafia *system* (mfumo leyi tekeke vutomi bya valweri va Mafia) which was orchestrated by Riina. Borsellino wasn't a ""mulweri kulobye wa yena"" (his own bodyguard) in this context.



"
I yini eka leswi landzelaka leswi nga riki swin’wana swa masagwadi ya Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **A: Nhenha ya Misava kambirhi** (Two health problems).

Here's why:

The text states that Hitoshi Saito passed away at the age of 54 due to intrahepatic bile duct cancer. It also mentions he was the president of the All Japan Judo Federation.  While he was a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a Judo teacher, the question asks about *what happened* to his other accomplishments or activities *after* his passing. The text directly states that his death was due to health problems. The other options describe things he *was* doing or *had been* doing, not what happened *after* his death.
"
Hi le kwihi laha lwasaki a koteke ku balekela ku endla swihlambanyo?,"The correct answer is **C: E Indiya**.

The passage states: ""...a balekeke vukati le Nepal kutani a ya khomiwa le India."" This translates to ""...he was taken between Nepal and then exiled to India.""
"
I mani la nga hlasela lwasaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Vayivi** (Police).

The text states: ""U phangeriwile hi vayivi..."" which translates to ""He was attacked by the police...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Loyi swi nga endlekaka a va munghana wa yena wa vukati** (His own middle-aged man) - This doesn't fit the context of an attack.
* **C: Mbyana** (Girl) - The text mentions a girl who saw something, but not that she attacked Iwasaki.
* **D: Maphorisa** (Police) - While ""Maphorisa"" is another word for police, ""Vayivi"" is the word used in the original text.



"
Alonso u tshike rini mphikizano wa yena?,"The correct answer is **C: Endzhaku ka loko Schumacher a tshike mphikizano wa yena**.

The passage states: ""Mutirhikulobye wa yena, Fernando Alonso a ri mukongomisi wa mphikizano nkarhi wo tala, kambe u tshikile endzhaku ka ndhawu ya yena ya ku wisa, kumbexana hikuva vhilwa ra yena ra le vuxa a ri ri na swiphiqo."" and ""Michael Schumacher u tshike mphikizano wa yena ku nga ri khale endzhaku ka Alonso, hileswi sasipenixini a yi onhake eka tindhawu to tala hi nkarhi wa mphikizano.""

This translates to: ""His teammate, Fernando Alonso was the race leader at the start, but he fell back after his pit stop, because his tires were worn."" and ""Michael Schumacher overtook his race after Alonso, which was reflected in the top positions at the time of the race.""

Therefore, Alonso fell back *after* Schumacher overtook him.
"
I yini leswi nga vanga leswaku Schumacher a tshika mphikizano wa yena?,"The correct answer is **A: A nga swi kotanga ku lawula movha wa yena (He couldn't control his car)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Giancarlo Fisichella a nga swi kotanga ku lawula movha wa yena naswona u tshike mphikizano hi ku hatlisa endzhaku ka ku sunguriwa."" (Giancarlo Fisichella couldn't control his car and also crashed shortly after the start.)

Then it says: ""Michael Schumacher u tshike mphikizano wa yena ku nga ri khale endzhaku ka Alonso..."" (Michael Schumacher also crashed shortly after Alonso...)

The context clearly links Schumacher's crash to having trouble controlling his car, similar to Fisichella. Options B, C, and D are not supported by the provided text. While a collision with Alonso might have been a factor, the passage focuses on the loss of control as the primary reason.
"
"Hi ku hi ndzimana, i ntirho wa mani ku ntshunxa vakhotsi?","The correct answer is **A: Mutirhela mfumo loyi a khomaka vanhu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Muavanyisi Glynn eka xivandla lexi ku sindzisa ku ntshunxiwa ka lava khomiweke ku tlula tiawara ta 24 tiawara endzhaku ka ku khomiwa ka vona laha ku nga amukeriwangiki ntshamo wa khoto.""  It further explains that Glynn ""veke beyili, loko yi nyikiwa, ivi a endla swihehlo swi va ximfumo hi ku khotsa mutirhela mfumo."" This means Glynn, acting on behalf of the system (the ""mutirhela mfumo""), created the alerts. The system itself is what triggered the alerts based on the circumstances.
"
"Hi ku ya hi xileriso xa nkarhinyana xa ku sivela lexi nga vuriwa eka ndzimana, vakhotsi va fanele va pfumeleriwa ku va na yini leswaku va khomiwa ku hundza tiawara ta 24?","The correct answer is **B: Nhlangano na mutirhela mfumo loyi a khomaka vanhu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi Dzivamusoko lembe leri, ku humesiwe xileriso xa nkarhinyana xa ndziriso hi Muavanyisi Glynn eka xivandla lexi ku sindzisa ku ntshunxiwa ka lava khomiweke ku tlula tiawara ta 24 endzhaku ka ku khomiwa ka vona laha ku nga amukeriwangiki ntshamo wa khoto. Mukhotsi u veke beyili, loko yi nyikiwa, ivi a endla swihehlo swi va ximfumo hi ku khotsa mutirhela mfumo.""

This directly links the 24-hour holding period to the actions of the system administrator (""mutirhela mfumo loyi a khomaka vanhu"").  The administrator's actions (locking down the system) are what caused the extended holding time. Therefore, the reason for the 24-hour holding period is related to the system administrator's involvement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Beyili:** While a bail might be involved later, it's not *why* the 24-hour holding period exists.
* **C: Swihehlo swa le nawini leswi nga nyikeriwa hi Muavanyisi Glynn:** The ""swihehlo"" (logs) are *a result* of the system administrator's actions, not the cause of the 24-hour period.
* **D: Ku yinigiseriwa ka nandzu ehubyeni:**  While there may be a judicial process, the passage focuses on the technical aspects of the system and the administrator's role in the holding period.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivangelo lexi nga tirhisiwangiki ku hlamusela ku lwisana?","The correct answer is **B: Ku lwetana ka vumbiwa (Warfare)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the model aims to *combat warfare* in Afghanistan and prevent a resurgence of terrorism. It also mentions that diplomats are concerned about the lack of meaningful engagement in the Afghan conflict, which is leading to the continuation of the war. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Makhombo ya vusirheleri (Terrorism):** While the model aims to fight terrorism, it's a *result* of warfare, not the primary thing being addressed by the model itself.
* **C: Swikoxo leswi tlakukeke swa nhlawulo (Fragile peace):**  Fragile peace is a *state* that the model hopes to achieve, but it's not the mechanism or process the model uses.
* **D: Ku kanakana hi vumbiwa (Lack of engagement in warfare):** This is a consequence of the conflict, not a mechanism to combat it.

Therefore, the model directly targets **warfare** as the issue to be addressed.



"
Hikwalahokayini vatirhelamfumo va hetelele va langute ku lwisana ku nga laveki?,"The correct answer is **C: A ku ri ni ku kanakana hi vumbiwa (There is a lack of proper coordination among the involved parties).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Vadipulomati va vule leswaku va kume ku kanakana loku ringaneke eka vumbiwa bya Afghan ku twisisa ku lwetana loku nga lavekiki."" This translates to ""Diplomats have stated that there is a lack of proper coordination among the involved parties in the Afghan mission, leading to unsuccessful efforts.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ku nga fambisani ni vumbiwa (There is no coordination among the involved parties):** While the passage mentions a lack of coordination, it doesn't say there is *no* coordination at all. It implies the coordination is improper.
* **B: A ku ri ni makhombo ya vusirheleri (There are corruption issues):** The passage mentions ""khombo ra vusirheleri eka nhlawulo wu’nwana"" (corruption in the entire operation), but the primary reason for the failed efforts is identified as lack of coordination.
* **D: Nhlawulo a wu koxa mali yo tala swinene (The operation spent a lot of money initially):** The passage doesn't provide information about the initial spending of the operation.



Therefore, option C most accurately reflects the reason given in the passage for the failed efforts to combat terrorism in Afghanistan."
I mani loyi a phamelaka vukorhokeri bya vuavanyisi eka FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Vayimeri va Politiki**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Muungameri wa Pakistani u hlawule “Vayimeri va Politiki” leswaku va lawula FATA..."" This translates to ""The Governor-General of Pakistan appointed ""Political Agents"" who controlled FATA...""  The passage then goes on to explain that these Political Agents controlled FATA using a system of governance that was highly autocratic and disregarded the Pakistani Constitution.  Therefore, the political agents, not the government, were responsible for controlling the people in FATA.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hulumendhe ya Pakistani (Pakistani Government):** The passage says the Political Agents *controlled* FATA, implying a level of autonomy from the central government.
*   **C: Muungameri wa Pakistani (Governor-General of Pakistan):** The Governor-General *appointed* the Political Agents, but the agents were the ones who actually exerted control.
*   **D: Hulumendhe ya Britain (British Government):** The passage discusses the situation after the partition of India in 1947, meaning the British government's direct control was no longer the primary factor."
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni “Vayimeri va Politiki” va FATA?,"The correct answer is **A: Va phamela vukorhokeri bya vuavanyisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Pakistani administration used ""Political Agents"" to control FATA, employing a system of indirect rule. These agents were often individuals without the experience to effectively run a government and were therefore responsible for **hampering the development of the local population**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Va hlawuriwe hi muungameri wa Pakistani:** The passage implies the agents *were* the administrators, not that they were controlled by the Pakistani government.
*   **C: Va namarhela vumbiwa bya Pakistani:** While they operated under Pakistani authority, the passage doesn't say they were directly involved in the Pakistani war or conflict.
*   **D: Va lawula tindhawu to karhi hi ku helela:** This doesn't align with the description of ""indirect rule"" and hindering development. The passage suggests their control was problematic and didn't lead to effective governance.

Hi wihi nkutlunya lowu Emma Stone a langiweke eka wona?,"The correct answer is **A: Mutlangi wa Xisati wo Famba Emahlweni (The Women's Film Festival)**.

The text states: ""Gosling na Stone va langiwile eka Mutlangi wo Famba Emahlweni havumbirhi."" which translates to ""Gosling and Stone were both cast in the Women's Film Festival.""
"
Hi wihi nkutlunya lowu filimi yi nga langiwangiki eka wona?,"The correct answer is **A: Xifaniso Lexi Fambaka Emahlweni**.

The text explicitly states: ""Gosling na Stone va langiwile eka Mutlangi wo Famba Emahlweni havumbirhi. Ku langiwa kun’wana ku katsa Xifaniso Lexi Fambaka Emahlweni..."" which means they *didn't* film for ""Xifaniso Lexi Fambaka Emahlweni"".  The other options are listed as locations where filming *did* occur.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi yeke emahlweni xi tirha endzhaku ka ku tsekatseka ka misava?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti-reactor hinkwato ta xitichi xa Hokuriku Shika**.

The passage states that the accident caused the shutdown of the Hokuriku Electric Power Co.'s Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant and that the reactor units of this plant were affected. Options B and D are mentioned as also being affected, but the primary direct consequence of the accident related to the nuclear power plant is the reactor units. Option C is a secondary effect of the accident.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi onhakeke hikwalaho ka ku tsekatseka ka misava?","The correct answer is **A: Makaya yo karhi (Frequent power outages)**.

The text states: ""Makaya lama ringanaka na 9400 eka ndhawu yoleyo a ya ha ri na mati naswona kwalomu ka 100 a ya na gezi."" This translates to ""Small outages of power and 9400 (presumably referring to some other utility) in the area, with 100 (presumably referring to a plant) having no water and gas."" This indicates frequent power disruptions.

While the other options mention specific locations (Shika, Noto), the primary consequence mentioned in the text relating directly to the accident is power outages.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi yihi lexi nga katsiwangiki etsalweni leri?","The correct answer is **A: Vumundzuku bya Yerusalema**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tinhloko mhaka tin’wana leti nga ta tlhuvutsiwa i vumundzuku bya Yerusalema leri kwetsimaka eka matiko hamambirhi ni mhaka ya Nkova wa Yoridani."" This translates to: ""Other key issues that will be discussed are the Jerusalem issue, which is located in both countries, and the issue of the Jordan River.""

The question asks which issue is *not* being discussed. The passage explicitly mentions Jerusalem and the Jordan River *as issues being discussed*. Therefore, the question is asking which of the options is *not* mentioned as a point of discussion. The passage doesn't directly mention the 1967 war's framework, the presence of troops on the Jordan River, or the negotiation of agreements as problematic. However, it *does* specifically highlight the Jerusalem issue as a key point of discussion.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Vumundzuku bya Yerusalema** because it's the only option directly mentioned as being a point of discussion. The other options relate to the context of the negotiation but aren't explicitly stated as problematic or under discussion in the text.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga laviwiki hi Palestina?,"The correct answer is **C: Tinhlamulo malunghana ni vumundzuku bya Yerusalema**.

Here's why:

The question asks what issues are causing concern for Palestinians *following* the initial agreement (referring to the 1967 boundaries). The passage explicitly states: ""Tinhloko mhaka tin’wana leti nga ta tlhuvutsiwa i vumundzuku bya Yerusalema leri kwetsimaka eka matiko hamambirhi ni mhaka ya Nkova wa Yoridani."" (Other major issues that will be discussed are the settlements in East Jerusalem and the presence of Israeli forces in the West Bank.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Mindzilakano leyi veke kona ku nga si fika nyimpi (The agreements that were made did not come into effect):** The passage *says* agreements *were* made (1967 boundaries), but the issues now are *related to the implementation and consequences* of those agreements.
* **B: Ku hambeta masocha ma ri kona eka Nkova wa Yoridani (The movement of troops in the West Bank):** While mentioned as a concern, it's overshadowed by the significant issue of settlements and Jerusalem.
* **D: Vukona bya masocha ku ringana malembe ya ntlhanu eka Nkova wa Yoridani (The deployment of troops for five days in the West Bank):** This is a specific detail of a past event and not the overarching concern *following* the initial agreement.

Therefore, the settlements in East Jerusalem and the presence of Israeli forces in the West Bank (which includes Jerusalem) are the primary sources of concern for Palestinians, according to the passage.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i ku va ni ntirhisano ni tiko rihi leswi pfuneke Ma ku hlula eka nhlawulo?","The correct answer is **D: China**.

"Leswi ku saleke mimphikizano ya mune eka nguva leyi, i mani loyi a nga eka nomboro ya vumune eka Driver’s Championship?","The correct answer is **A: Hamlin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Eka xiyenge xa vunharhu, Hamlin u le ndzhaku hi mikutlunya ya 20, kambe u le mahlweni ka Bowyer hi ntlhanu.""  This means Hamlin is in 20th place overall, but is 5 positions ahead of Bowyer.  While the other drivers are closer to the lead, Hamlin is the only one explicitly mentioned as having a chance to move up and potentially reach a top position.

"Endzhaku ka mphikizano lowu boxiweke eka xiyenge lexi, i mikutlunya yingani leyi Kahne a nga na yona eka Driver’s Championship?","The correct answer is **B: 2250**.

The question asks for the number of laps Kahne is behind Keselowski in the Driver's Championship. The text states: ""Endzhaku ka mphikizano, Keselowski wa ha rhange emahlweni eka Driver’s Championship hi mikutlunya ya 2,250."" This translates to ""At the end of the race, Keselowski is ahead in the Driver's Championship by 2,250 laps."" Therefore, Kahne is 2250 laps behind.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i kangani laha vanhu va voneke ti-meteorite leti waka leti endzhaku ti vonakeke ti huma e-Mars?","The correct answer is **C: Ka khumentlhanu**.

The text states: ""Ka khumentlhanu wa maribye lawa a ku vuriwa leswaku ma wile eka meteorite hi July leyi nga hundza."" This translates to ""Approximately forty-five meteorites have been reported to have fallen into a meteorite in July.""

The question asks how many of the collected meteorites are believed to have originated from Mars. The text explicitly says ""34 wa tona ntsena leti ku tiyisekisiwaka leswaku ti huma eMars,"" meaning ""34 of these are confirmed to have come from Mars.""  Since 34 is closest to 45, and the closest option is 45 (khumentlhanu), that's the right answer. There is a slight discrepancy in the numbers given (34 confirmed, 45 reported), but option C is the best fit among the choices.
"
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge, hi wihi ntiyiso malunghana ni maribye lama kumekeke ma huma e-Mars?","The correct answer is **A: Hinkwaswo swi kumeke hi nkarhi wa ku wa ka ti-meteorite hi July.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that 34 meteorites have been confirmed to originate from Mars.
* It also mentions that 34 meteorites were expected to fall in July.
* Option A combines these two pieces of information, accurately reflecting the main point of the question and the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku na 24,000 wa tona:** This refers to the total number of meteorites found, not specifically those from Mars.
* **C: Ti ni ntsengo wa $11,000 ku tlula nsuku:** This refers to the price of some meteorites, not the number of meteorites from Mars.
* **D: Ku na 34 wa tona:** While true, this only addresses one aspect of the question (confirmed Martian meteorites) and doesn't mention the expected fall in July.  Option A provides a more complete answer.



"
Xana Schumacher u tshika rini ntirho?,"The correct answer is **B: Endzhaku ka ku hlula mphikizano wakwe wa vunkombo**

Here's why:

The question states: ""Schumacher loyi a tshikeke ntirho hi 2006 endzaku ko hlula eka mphikizano wa Formula 1 ka nkombo..."" which translates to ""Schumacher took over the position in 2006 after a crash in the Formula 1 race...""

Option B directly reflects this information. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Endzhaku ka ku vaviseka ka Felipe Massa** - While Schumacher *did* take over after Massa's injury, the *reason* he took over was the crash.
* **C: Endzhaku ko siva Felipe Massa** -  Schumacher didn't replace Massa *because* he ""siva"" (knocked out/injured) him. He took over *after* the accident.
* **D: Eku heleni ka nguva ya 2009** - This is too specific and doesn't encompass the general timeframe established in the text.



"
Xana Massa u vaviseke rini?,"The correct answer is **B: Endzhaku ko hlula mphikizano wa Formula 1**.

The text states: ""Schumacher loyi a tshikeke ntirho hi 2006 endzaku ko hlula eka mphikizano wa Formula 1 ka nkombo...""  This directly translates to ""Schumacher who took over the position after a crash in the Formula 1 race in 2006..."".  The subsequent sentence explains *why* he took over the position - due to Massa's injury. So, Massa's injury happened *after* the crash.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana lunghiselelo leri ri ta yi khumba njhani AOL?","The correct answer is **A: Nhlayo ya vatirhisi va AOL swi nga endleka yi tlakuka** (AOL users' loyalty may decrease).

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL's decline was likely caused by the emergence of Instant Messaging (IM) and the competition from Yahoo! and Microsoft. This competition would naturally lead users to switch to platforms offering better or more integrated IM experiences. Therefore, AOL's user base would likely shrink.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: AOL yi ta va yona ntsena khampani leyi sunguleke vuxaviselo bya IM** (AOL will become the pioneer company of IM services) - The passage says AOL *started* IM, but implies they were overtaken by others.
*   **C: Nhlayo ya vatirhisi yi ta phikizana ni vatirhisi va Yahoo na Microsoft** (Users' loyalty will compete with Yahoo and Microsoft users) - The passage discusses user *loyalty* to AOL decreasing, not a competition between user loyalty groups.
*   **D: AOL a yi nge he tirhisiwi eUnited States** (AOL is not used in the United States) - This is directly contradicted by the passage, which says IM was ""widely used in the United States.""



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga tshukaka swi hela eku heleni ka lunghiselelo leri?,"The best answer is **A: Nhluvukiso wa inthanete lowu anameke eUnited States (The rise of the internet in the United States)**.

Here's why:

* **A is the overarching factor:** The rise of the internet fundamentally changed how people communicated. This created opportunities for new messaging platforms to emerge and allowed existing platforms like Yahoo! Messenger and later, others, to gain traction.  AOL's early success with ICQ was partly *because* the internet was growing, but its later struggles were tied to the *evolving* internet landscape.

* **B (Ku tirhisiwa ka vuxaviselo bya IM - Use of IM software) and C (Ntshunxeko wa AOL wo hluvukisa vuxaviselo hi rivilo ra yona - AOL's failure to innovate its software) are contributing factors, but not the primary driver of AOL's decline.** While these played a role, they were reactions to the bigger change.  ICQ was popular *because* of the internet, and AOL's failure to adapt further contributed to its downfall.

* **D (Ku tirhisana ka Yahoo na Microsoft - The alliance between Yahoo! and Microsoft) is a competitor, not the root cause of AOL's issues.**  The competition was a consequence of the overall market shift, not the reason for AOL's decline.


Therefore, the rise of the internet was the most significant underlying cause of the changes that ultimately led to AOL's declining user base.



"
I vanhu vangani lava dlayiweke eka nhlaselo lava a va nga ri maphorisa?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The question states: ""maphorisa mambirhi naswona yi vavise vanhu van’wana vo tlula makumembirhi"" which translates to ""two police officers also attacked others who were passing by"".  The question then asks how many people were killed in the attack *that were not police officers*.  The text says ""vanhu van’wana vo tlula makumembirhi"" meaning ""other people who were passing by"" and that the number of people killed was ""19"".
"
I mani loyi a vikeke muehleketeleriwa eka nhlaselo lowu?,"The correct answer is **A: Maphorisa (Police)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks who the police suspect are responsible for the attack.
* The text explicitly states: ""Maphorisa ma vule leswaku vahlohloteri va nyimpi va Daesh (ISIL) hi vona va endleke nhlaselo lowu."" (Police stated that military terrorists of Daesh (ISIL) were responsible for this attack.)
* While the other options are affected by the attack, the police are the ones being specifically implicated as the target of the attack, and as the ones investigating.

Therefore, the police are the most direct answer to the question of who the suspects are.
"
"Hikwalaho ka leswi Florida a ri langutiwa ri ri mfumo lowu nga nhenha, xana Mitt Romney u nyikiwe ku hlula kwihi?","The correct answer is **D: 46 wa tiphesente ta tivhoti**.

Here's why:

* The question asks where Mitt Romney *won*. The text explicitly states he won 46 percent of the vote in Florida.
* Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they refer to the percentage of Republican voters, the position in the Republican party, or a general category of voters, not a specific win. The question is about where he *won*, not the percentage of the vote or the overall political climate.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i tiphesente tingani ta tivhoti leti Gingrich a nga na tona eka nhlawulo lowukulu?","The correct answer is **B: 32 wa tiphesente**.

The text explicitly states: ""Muvulavuleri wa khale wa U.S. wa le House Newt Gingrich u ve wa vumbirhi hi ti phesenti ta 32.""  This translates to ""Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich came in second with 32 percent.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a tshikeke ku va emphikizanweni wa nhlawulo endzhaku ka vuyelo bya nhlangano?","The correct answer is **A: Gingrich**.

The passage states: ""Endzhaku ka loko vuyelo byi humile, Gingrich u ndhundhuzele Santorum, kambe u holovele Romney..."" This indicates Gingrich was performing well and gaining momentum after the Iowa caucuses. The other candidates are described as facing setbacks or strategizing for later in the campaign, not as the frontrunner immediately after.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a ndhundhuzeleke muyimeri un’wana endzhaku ka vuyelo bya nhlangano?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Endzhaku ka loko vuyelo byi humile, Gingrich u ndhundhuzele Santorum, kambe u holovele Romney..."" (After the votes were tallied, Gingrich went after Santorum, but then he targeted Romney...).
"
Hi yihi ndhawu yin’we ntsena laha nongonoko wu kombisiweke eka yona emahlweni ka 2015?,"The correct answer is **C: AstroNet Radio**.

The text states: ""Loko 2015 yi ya eku heleni, TogiNet yi simeke AstroNet Radio tanihi xiphemu lexikulu xa xitichi."" (In 2015, TogiNet became AstroNet Radio the main school station.) This means the station where the broadcaster was featured publicly in 2015 was AstroNet Radio.
"
Xana switichi swi hlamusela leswaku nongonoko wu ve ni nkucetelo wihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Maendlelo yo hlekisa** (Humorous edits).

The passage explicitly states that the radio station ""hlamusela nongonoko lowu tanihi 'mintlango ya rhadiyo ya xikolo xa khale lexi nga ni maendlelo lamantswa ni lama hlekisaka'"" which translates to ""broadcasts a character who is a 'radio tradition of old school school with humorous and funny edits'"". Therefore, the edits are primarily humorous.
"
I yini leswi David Headley a swi kumeke leswi eku heteleleni swi pfuneke eka nhlaselo wa masocha?,"The correct answer is **C: Vatameri va swibamu (Terrorists)**.

The passage states: ""David Headley eka vuvalangi ni ku simekiwa u pfune eku tirheni ka pfhumba ra vavanuna va 10 lava a va hlome hi swibamu ku suka eka ntlawa wa masocha wa le Pakistan ku nga Laskhar-e-Taiba."" This translates to: ""David Headley confessed and was arrested for being involved in the planning of the attack that killed 10 soldiers originating from the militant wing of Pakistan-based Laskhar-e-Taiba.""

Therefore, David Headley was involved with **terrorists**.
"
Xana i vutleketli bya muxaka muni lebyi ntlawa wa masocha wu byi tirhiseke ku ya le Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Xikepe (Ship)**.

The passage states: ""...swibalesa swa othomethiki ni michini yo hlasela vanhu vo hlaya hi nkarhi wun’we ku katsa ni **xitichi xa xitimele lexi teleke**..."" which translates to ""...automatic weapons and machinery used to attack people at a certain time while traveling on a **high-speed train**..."".  However, the question asks about the *means of transport* used by the attackers to *reach* Mumbai, and the passage explicitly mentions ""xikepe"" (ship) as the vessel used by David Headley to arrive from Pakistan.
"
Hi wahi marito lama kombisaka kahle vuyelo bya ntlangu wa Nadal na Raonic le Brisbane Open lowu boxiweke eka xiyenge lexi?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic u hlule Nadal**.

The question asks *why* the analysis of Nadal's serve was highlighted in the box. The provided text states ""Ku nga ri khale u hluriwile hi Raonic eka Brisbane Open"" which translates to ""He was not easily defeated by Raonic at the Brisbane Open."" This indicates that Raonic won the match against Nadal.

Therefore, the analysis of Nadal's serve is relevant because it provides context to the match outcome – that even with a strong serve, Nadal still lost.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raonic a ri ni mikutlunya ya 88%** - This is a detail about Nadal's serve percentage, not why the analysis was highlighted.
* **C: Nadal u hlule Raonic** - This is incorrect, the text says Nadal was defeated.
* **D: Raonic u kume mikutlunya ya 76** - This is also a detail about Raonic's serve percentage, not the reason for the highlighted analysis.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xiyimo xa ntlangu wa Nadal na Raonic a xi ri xihi endzhaku ka sevhe yo sungula?","The correct answer is **A: Raonic a ri ni mikutlunya ya 88%**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nadal u kume 88% wa mikutlunya eka mikutlunya ya 76 yo hlula ntlangu eka sevhe yo sungula."" This means Raonic had 88% of first serve points in the first set.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nadal u hlule mikutlunya ya 76** - This is incorrect. The text says Nadal *won* 88% of first serve points.
*   **C: Xikoro a xi ri 7-2** - This is the score of the match, not what happened *after* the first serve.
*   **D: Raonic u hlule Nadal** - This is not directly stated in the text. The text focuses on Nadal's success with his first serve percentage.



"
Hi wihi nongonoko wa ririmi lowu nga katsiwangiki eka vuhaxi byinharhu lebyintshwa bya Naked News?,"The correct answer is **A: Xintariyani**.

The text states that Naked News has expanded to Xinghezi (presumably referring to China), Japan, and the world, broadcasting in Spanish, **German (Xintariyani)**, and Korean.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi kwihi laha vuhaxi lebyintshwa bya Naked News byi nga taka byi nga kumeki kona?","The correct answer is **B: Inthanete (Internet)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Naked News was blocked in China and Japan due to its sexually explicit content. It also mentions that Naked News expanded its reach through the internet, television, and mobile phones, broadcasting in Spanish, English, and Korean.

Since the blocking happened in China and Japan, the most likely place where Naked News was being accessed (and therefore blocked) is **on the internet.** The other options are possible platforms, but the text directly links the expansion and the subsequent blocking to the internet.
"
I vaphikizani vangani lava tsandzekeke ku heta Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The text states: ""Naswona 45 eka 117 wa vatlangi eka Xihontlovila Slalom va tsandzekile eka ntlango."" This translates to ""Also, 45 out of 117 competitors in the Giant Slalom completed the race.""
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi kombisaka kahle vuyelo bya mimphikizano ya Mitlangu ya Vunhenha?,"The best answer is **B: Vatlangi va skiya va 45 a va hetanga rhengu ra vona eka Giant Slalom.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what *best* shows the fairness of the competition.** Option B highlights a significant number of skiers (45 out of 117) *not finishing* the Giant Slalom. This indicates a problem with the course or conditions, suggesting the competition wasn't fair for those skiers.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Eka mphikizano wa vumbirhi, Carpenado u hete emahlweni ka mutlangi wo skiya wa le Hungary:** While Carpenado winning is a result of the competition, it doesn't directly speak to the fairness for *all* participants.
* **C: Vatlangi vo tala va skiya va hete Giant Slalom ku tlula Slalom:** This just describes the order of events; it doesn't indicate fairness.
* **D: Carpenado u hete a ri wa vukhume eka Slalom:** This only focuses on Slalom and Carpenado's performance, not the overall fairness of Giant Slalom.



Therefore, option B provides the strongest evidence that the Giant Slalom competition wasn't fair for a considerable portion of the skiers.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi NBA yi endleke xiboho xo xi yimisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Mutlangi wihi ni wihi loyi a kumekeke a ri na COVID-19**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xiboho lexi xa NBA xi tekiwe endzhaku ka loko mutlangi wa Jazz wa le Utah a kumiwe a ri ni xitsongwatsongwana xa COVID-19.""  This translates to: ""The NBA season was postponed after a player from the Utah Jazz was diagnosed with COVID-19.""

Therefore, the *reason* for the postponement was a player testing positive for COVID-19, not a specific timeframe, the team itself, or the entire team. It was the *player* who tested positive.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi vangeleke ku vilela ka NBA malunghana ni xitsongwatsongwana?","The correct answer is **D: Mutlangi wa Utah Jazz u kumiwe a ri ni xitsongwatsongwana.**

Here's why:

* The prompt states: ""Xiboho lexi xa NBA xi tekiwe endzhaku ka loko mutlangi wa Jazz wa le Utah a kumiwe a ri ni xitsongwatsongwana.""  This translates to: ""This news was released after a player from the Jazz in Utah was suspended because he tested positive for COVID-19.""

Option D directly reflects this statement. While options A and B mention positive tests, they don't accurately reflect the *cause* of the NBA pausing the season. Option C describes the player's actions *after* being suspended, not the reason for the pause.

Therefore, the key event that triggered the NBA's pause was the positive COVID-19 test of a Utah Jazz player.
"
I mani loyi a huwiseke golo yo hlula ya Washington Capitals eka ntlangu wa vona na Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **D: Alex Ovechkin**.

The question states: ""Mpfuneto wo rhanga wa Ovechkin madyambu wolawo a wu ri wa golo leyi hluleke ntlangu hi mutlangi loyi a sungula ku nghena Nicklas Backstrom..."" which translates to ""Ovechkin's winning goal in this game was the first goal scored by the player who entered Nicklas Backstrom..."" 

Therefore, Alex Ovechkin scored the first goal for the Washington Capitals.
"
I mani loyi a huwiseke golo yakwe ya vu-60 ya nguva eka ntlangu wa Capitals vs. Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The question states that Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season in the game against the Atlanta Thrashers.
"
Hi rini laha bangi ya Northern Rock yi laveke mpfuno wa hulumendhe?,"The correct answer is **A: Endzhaku ka loko bangi yi ve ehansi ko lawuriwa hi hulumendhe.**

The text states: ""Bangi ya Northern Rock yi kombele mpfuno hikwalaho ka leswi ku tshuburiweke leswaku yi hakerisiwe ntswalo lowu tlulaka mpimo wa mali leyi yi lombiweke yona hi 2007.""  This means the request for bailout happened *after* the government took control.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko bangi yi humile eka khampani ya vufambisi bya rifuwo:** While the bank *did* eventually become a retail bank, the bailout request happened before that transition.
* **C: Endzhaku ka loko Virgin Group yi xave bangi:** Virgin's offer was rejected, and then the government took over. The bailout request was related to the financial issues, not Virgin's failed bid.
* **D: Hi nkarhi nkitsikitsi wa tihakelo ta mali leyi lombisiwaka hi bangi:** The financial issues (excessive risk-taking) were the *cause* of the bailout request, not the time it occurred.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate based on the provided text.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle ku tirhisana ka Virgin Group swin’we na bangi na Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **D: Virgin Group yi ringete ro sungula ku yi xava endzhaku ka loko bangi yi sungule ku lawuriwa hi hulumendhe.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Virgin Group ya Nkulukumba Richard Branson yi ringetile ku xava bangi leyi kambe xikombelo xa yona xi bakanyiwile ivi yi sungula ku lawuriwa hi hulumendhe."" (Richard Branson's Virgin Group attempted to buy the bank, but the offer was rejected and it began to be nationalized.)

This directly indicates that Virgin Group *attempted* to buy Northern Rock *before* the government took control. Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Virgin Group yi tlhele yi xava khampani ya vufambisi bya rifuwo ya Northern Rock** - This is incorrect because the passage says they *attempted* to buy the *whole bank*, not specifically a risky investment company.
* **B: Virgin Group yi xave bangi endzhaku ka loko yi sungule ku lawuriwa hi hulumendhe** -  The passage explicitly says they tried *before* the government took over.
* **C: Virgin Group yi nyike bangi nseketelo wa xihatla hi nkarhi wa nkitsikitsi wa tihakelo ta mali leyi lombisiwaka hi bangi** - The passage doesn't mention any settlement or deal regarding the risky assets.



"
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge lexi, hi rihi tiko leri khumbiwaka hi sayiniwa ka ntwanano wa maxelo wa Kyoto?","The correct answer is **A: United States**.

The passage states: ""Xiboho xa Nkul. Rudd xo sayina xiboho xa ntwanano wa Kyoto xi vekela etlhelo United States..."" which translates to ""The national announcement. Rudd signed the Kyoto Protocol in the United States...""

The question asks which country *was not* party to the Kyoto Protocol. The passage explicitly mentions the United States as being a key location for the signing, and implies they were not a party due to the context of the paragraph.  It also mentions India and China not agreeing to the climate accord.
"
Khale ka hulumendhe ya Australia a yi ehleketa leswaku ku amukeriwa ka ntwanano wa Kyoto a ku ta onha yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikhonomi ya tiko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hulumendhe ya khale ya le Australia yi arile ku amukela Kyoto, ku vuriwe leswaku ntwanano wolowo a wu ta onha ikhonomi tanihi leswi yi titshegeke swinene hi ku rhumela malahla eka matikomambe...""

This means the Australian government believed the Kyoto Protocol would positively impact the *economy* significantly.  While the provision of funds to developing nations is mentioned, the overall impact was projected to be on the Australian economy.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: United States:** The passage discusses Australia's perspective, not the US's.
* **C: Ku rhumeriwa ka malahla eka matiko mambe:**  This is a *part* of how Australia believed the economy would be affected, but the overall effect was on the economy itself, not just the act of sending money.
* **D: Tipakani leti vekiweke malunghana ni ku thyakisiwa ka moya:** This refers to the core issue of climate change and emissions, but not the *economic* impact as the Australian government foresaw it.



"
Vaduvuri va swiharhi a va hirhiwe ku nghenela nongonoko wihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Nongonoko wo hlota wa Sporting Shooters Association**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Loko ku hlanganisiwe NPWS na Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, vanhu lava tirhaka hi ku tirhandzela lava wu dyondzeleke va komberiwile, ehansi ka **nongonoko wa ku hlota wa Sporting Shooters Association** Hi kuya hi Mick O'Flynn...""

This clearly indicates that the individuals were disciplined by the shooting club associated with the Sporting Shooters Association. While NPWS is mentioned, it's in relation to the partnership with the shooting association, not as the direct entity disciplining the individuals.
"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga kombisiki hi ku kongoma ndzingeto wo lawula switsotswana?,"The correct answer is **A: Tanihileswi a ku ri ndzingeto wo rhanga wa nongonoko, a wu kamberiwanga**.

Here's why:

The text states that despite the NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service) and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. working together, the governing body of the Sporting Shooters Association did not issue warning letters to those involved in the unauthorized shooting. This indicates a failure in enforcing regulations and holding those responsible accountable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Vaduvuri va amukele swiletelo swa ndzetelo:** The text doesn't mention whether shooters accepted any sanctions.
*   **C: Vaduvuri a va vekiwa tihloko hi vasirheleri:** The text says shooters were *warned* (vinyikiwe vuleteri bya xiyimo xa le henhla), not put in danger.
*   **D: Ku hlawuriwe vaduvuri va mune:** The text indicates the *unauthorized* shooting wasn't properly managed, not that the shooters were managed.

Therefore, the most accurate statement reflecting what the text reveals about the lack of regulatory enforcement is that the governing body of the association did not issue warnings.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, ku avana ku kumiwe kwihi?","The correct answer is **B: Eka masalela ya le maribyeni** (In the Rift Valley).

The passage states: ""Hi ku ya hi vumbhoni bya masalela lama kumiwe emaribyeni..."" which translates to ""It is said that ten fossils were discovered in the Rift Valley...""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi endlekeke hi xihatla ku tlula leswi a swi languteriwile?","The correct answer is **C: Ku kamberiwa ka vumbhoni bya molekhuli** (Analysis by molecular evidence).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leswi swi vula leswaku ku hambana ku endleke khalenyana ku tlula leswi a swi ehleketiwa hi vumbhoni bya timolekuli."" This translates to: ""What reveals that the variation is due to a disease that precedes what has been examined by molecular evidence.""  This clearly indicates that the molecular evidence is being used to analyze the differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku kumiwa ka masalela ya le maribyeni** (Collection of samples from the marshes) - While samples might be collected, the passage focuses on *what is done* with the samples, not just the collection.
*   **B: Ku avana** (Evolution) -  The passage suggests a disease is involved and that molecular evidence helps determine the variation *related to the disease*, not a general statement about evolution.
*   **D: Ndzavisiso le Rift Valley** (The Rift Valley) - The Rift Valley is simply the location of the research, not the action being described.



"
I yini lexi mutlangi a faneleke ku xi endla ku lawula leswi endliwaka eka ntlangu wa vhidiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku fambisa xo lawula emoyeni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...vatlangi va lawula swilo leswi endliwaka eka mintlango ya vhidiyo hi ku fambisa xitirhisiwa emoyeni."" (Players control the actions in video games by moving the controller in the air.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tiyisisa leswaku tisensara ta mulawuri ti le kusuhi ni xitirhisiwa xo lawula:** While the sensors and controller are involved, this doesn't explain *how* the player controls the game.
*   **B: Ku yi endla yi vonake ka nharhu:** This describes the visual effect of the controller, not the control mechanism.
*   **C: Ku veka tisensara ekusuhi ni thelevhini:** This is a description of the controller's components and placement, not the action of controlling the game.



"
I yini lexi endliweke ku languteka tanihi rhimoti ya thelevhixini?,"The correct answer is **A: Tisensara timbirhi ta mulawuri** (Two sensors).

The passage explicitly states: ""Switirhisiwa leswi swi tirhisa tinsensara timbirhi leti vekiwaka ku suhi na thelevixini..."" which translates to ""The controllers use two sensors attached to the TV...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xilawuri xa Nintendo Revolution** (Nintendo Revolution controller): While the controllers *control* the Nintendo Revolution, the key feature making them unique is the use of sensors.
* **C: Mbulavulo lowukulu** (Major breakthrough): The passage describes a technological advancement, but doesn't label it a ""major breakthrough"" in this context.
* **D: Xitirhisiwa xo lawula xa Nintendo Revolution** (Nintendo Revolution control device): This is too general. While the controllers *are* control devices, the specifics of *how* they work are highlighted as the innovation – the sensors.

I yini lexi a xi nga boxiwanga eka xiviko xa sweswinyana xo huma eka vaviki va mahungu va le Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Xihahampfhuka xi xungutiwile hi bomo (The fire was caused by a bomb).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the initial reports from Xinhua indicated the fire was *caused by a bomb* (""xihaha mpfhuka xi tlhakisiwile. Endzhaku swiviko swi kombisa leswaku xihaha mpfhuka xi kume nxungeto wa bomo"").
* Option B is incorrect because the text says the fire was *initially* in Ürümqi, but it moved to Afghanistan, not the other way around.
* Option C is incorrect because while the fire *did* move to Afghanistan, the key initial detail reported was that it was caused by a bomb.
* Option D is incorrect because Kandahar is a location in Afghanistan where the fire ended up, not where the initial cause was reported.



"
I yini lexi a xi nga boxiwanga eka xiviko xo rhanga xa vaviki va mahungu va Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **D: Xihahampfhuka xi kume nxungeto wa bomo**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *isn't* mentioned in the Xinhua news agency's initial report. The passage states:

* **Initial report (Xinhua):** ""xihaha mpfhuka xi tlhakisiwile"" (the earthquake was reduced).
* **Later reports:** ""xihaha mpfhuka xi kume nxungeto wa bomo naswona xi jikele eAfghanistan..."" (the earthquake caused a tsunami and also spread to Afghanistan...).

Therefore, the tsunami caused by the earthquake is information that wasn't included in the initial report from Xinhua.  The other options *were* mentioned:

* **A:** The earthquake was reduced.
* **B:** The earthquake was diverted to a route that was used to transport grain.
* **C:** The earthquake spread to Afghanistan.



"
I yini leswi tivisiweke hi Sara Danius eka nongonoko wa xiyanimoya?,"The correct answer is **A: Muhluri wa Sagwadi ra Nobel ra Matsalwa**.

The text explicitly states that Sara Danius was the Secretary of the Swedish Academy (which handles the Nobel Prize in Literature). The question asks what Sara Danius *is* to the literary critic, and the text identifies her role.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Komiti a yi amukelanga nhlamulo eka vanyiki va swibumabumelo:** While the text *implies* a lack of enthusiasm from the committee, it doesn't directly state that they rejected nominations.
*   **C: Lava langiweke va 2016 eka Sagwadi ra Nobel ra Matsalwa:** This refers to the winner, not Sara Danius's position.
*   **D: Komiti yi ta yimisa matshalatshala yo tihlanganisa na Bob Dylan:** This describes an action the committee *considered*, not who Sara Danius *is*.



"
I mani loyi swi nga kotekangiki ku n’wi fikelela?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The text states that the Nobel Committee tried to reach Bob Dylan to get him to accept the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016, but he declined. The text specifically mentions they tried to contact him and that he ultimately didn't accept.
"
"""I mani loyi a vuleke leswaku xiboho xexo """"a ku ri pakani”?""","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The question asks who made the statement about the ""nuclear capabilities"" being a ""threat to the region."" The text explicitly states that ""Muvulavuleri wa Bush ku nga Gordon Johndroe...ku vule xihlambanyo xa North Korea..."" which translates to ""Bush administration's Gordon Johndroe...spoke out against North Korea..."" 

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who made the statement.
"
Xana Slania u endle switempe swingani swa matiko you hambanahambana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tlula 2,000**.

The text states: ""U endle switempe swo tlula 1,000 swa Sweden na 28 swa matiko man’wana."" This translates to: ""He made over 1,000 stamps of Sweden and 28 of other countries.""  That means he made a total of more than 1,000 + 28 = more than 1,028. Since the options include ""Ku tlula 2,000"" (Over 2,000), and the actual number is over 1,028, the best answer among the choices is A.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi vangele ku pfuta loku hambetaka ka timbhovo ta thangi?","The correct answer is **B: Ku kamberiwa loku tolovelekeke ka xo tima ndzilo (Condensation of the flow)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ku tsemeka ka gezi endzhaku ka ku kamberiwa loku tolovelekeke ka xo tima ndzilo ku vangela tiphayiphi leswaku ti pfuleka kutani oyili yi pfhupfhuma ekusuhi na xitichi 9 xa Fort Greely.""  This means that condensation (the turning of gas back into liquid) caused the pipeline to rupture and oil to leak. The subsequent pressure buildup in the tanks led to the tank issues.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tatiwa swinene ka ndhawu ya vumbirhi ya vuhlayiselo (Double wall failure):** While a double-wall failure *could* be a cause, the text directly attributes the initial rupture to condensation.
* **C: Ku ndlandlamuka ka nsimbi (Earthquake):** The text doesn't mention any earthquakes.
* **D: Ndzilo eka xin’wana xa switichi swa tipompo swa Fort Greely (Road near another Fort Greely pump station):** The road's proximity isn't mentioned as a cause of the tank issues.
"
Hikwalaho ka yini tiphayiphi ti pfulekile?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku ve na ku tsemeka ka gezi endzhaku ko kambela xitrhisiwa.**

The passage states: ""Ku tsemeka ka gezi endzhaku ka ku kamberiwa loku tolovelekeke ka xo tima ndzilo ku vangela tiphayiphi leswaku ti pfuleka kutani oyili yi pfhupfhuma ekusuhi na xitichi 9 xa tipompo xa Fort Greely."" This directly links the pipeline rupture to gas being released due to thawing ground.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku ve na ku ndlandlamuka ka nsimu endzeni ka mathangi:** While ground movement *can* cause pipeline ruptures, the passage specifically mentions *gas release* as the immediate cause in this instance.
* **C: Mathangi a ma tele swinene:** The passage doesn't mention the tanks being far apart.
* **D: Ndhawu ya vumbirhi ya vuhlayiselo a yi nga swi koti ku tamela tibarele leti ringaneke:** The passage indicates that the tank's design is not the issue, but rather the consequence of the rupture.



"
"Sweswi, mati ma tlakuke ku fikela kwihi eka Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **D: 100 wa tifiti**.

The passage states: ""Mati ma halaka eka mpimo wa vuanamo bya **100 wa tifiti**."" (Water rushed to the base of 100-foot levees.)
"
"Hi nkarhi wa Bubutsa ra Katrina, ku endleke yini hi Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **B: Mati yo fika exisutini ma tlule mpimo**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...mati lama fikeke exisutini tanihi leswi mpimo wa le kusuhi wu taleke ku tlurisa."" This translates to ""...water reached the surroundings, exceeding the flood levels.""
* **Option A** is incorrect because it only mentions the water level reaching 100 feet, not the flooding.
* **Option C** is incorrect because it mentions 20 feet, which is not the core issue stated in the text.
* **Option D** is partially correct (the 6th levee *was* overtopped), but the main consequence mentioned for the Ninth Ward is the water reaching and exceeding flood levels.  Option B encompasses the primary impact.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tiyisisiwangiki hi Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **C: Loko kumbexana maendlelo lama faneleke ma landzeriwile (Whether proper procedures were followed)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Hamilton *tiyisekise leswaku* (confirmed that) the university accepted the patient and took steps to contain the spread. This implies that the procedures *were* followed.  The question asks what Hamilton *didn't* confirm. Therefore, the opposite of Hamilton confirming proper procedures is that they weren't followed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Laha muvabyi a yeke kona (That the patient stayed there):** The text *implies* the patient remained at the university, as they took steps to contain the spread. It doesn't say they left.
* **B: Leswaku muvabyi a nga tshuka a ngheniwa hi xitsongwatsongwana (That the patient could not be infected by Ebola):** The text states the patient *was* infected and had been in contact with Ebola victims. It doesn't say they *couldn't* be infected.
* **D: Xiyimo xa sweswi xa muvabyi (The patient's condition):**  The text *mentions* the patient's condition (being infected and in contact with Ebola victims), but Hamilton's confirmation wasn't *specifically* about the patient's condition itself, but rather about the containment measures.



"
I nchumu wihi lowu va n’wasayense va lavaka ku wu twisisa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndlela leyi Misava yi endliweke ha yona**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Va n’wasayense va navela ku twisisa ndlela leyi tipulanete ti endlekaka ha yona, ngopfu-ngopfu ndlela leyi misava yi sunguleke ha yona, ku sukela loko maribye ya le mpfhukeni ya tlumbane na Misava khale ngopfu."" (Scientists have recently understood how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since the Earth collided with the Moon long ago.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nkarhi lowu maribye lama sukaka empfhukeni ma tlumbaneke ha wona ni Misava:** While the collision is mentioned, the passage focuses on *how the Earth formed* as a result of that collision, not just the fact of the collision itself.
* **B: Ndlela leyi ti phurotheyini ti endlekaka ha yona:** This is mentioned as a general topic of scientific research related to life, but it's not the *specific* focus of the scientists' recent understanding as stated in the passage.
* **C: Leswi swilo swa ntumbuluko swi nga swona:** This is also mentioned as a general topic related to life, but not the primary focus of the scientists' breakthrough.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i xiphemu xihi lexi maphorisa ya ndhawu ma xi hetisiseke eku pfariweni?","The correct answer is **A: Va hlohlotele FBI ku pfala (They alerted the FBI to investigate).**

The text explicitly states: ""Vulawuri Bya Vutleketli bya Maryland va pfale hi ku khuthaziwa hi FBI."" (Maryland State Police turned to the FBI for help.) The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
Ku endleke yihi hi vungheno bya tindlela ta chubu hi nkarhi wa ku pfariwa,"The correct answer is **B: A ti tirhisiwa tanihi ndlela yo hambuka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tilori to rwala misava ti tirhisiwile ku pfala tindlela to nghena naswona maphorisa ya 80 a va pfuna vanhu va nghena hi ndlela yin’wana.""  This translates to: ""Smuggling vehicles were used to find ways to enter, and 80 police officers were looking for people to enter in another way.""

This indicates that the smugglers *did* use vehicles as a means of entry, but the passage emphasizes they were searching for *alternative* methods of entry. Therefore, option B, ""A ti tirhisiwa tanihi ndlela yo hambuka"" (They were used as a means of entry), is the most accurate reflection of the information provided.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga endlekangiki emahlweni ko va muteki wa swifaniso a chayisiwa hi movha?","The correct answer is **A: Muteki wa swifaniso u lerisiwile hi Highway Patrol ku va a humela etlhelo.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""kambirhi, phorisa ra California Highway Patrol leri kongomisaka mimovha leswaku ri n’wi lerisa ku humela etlhelo..."" This directly means the police directed him to go to the hospital.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Muteki wa swifaniso u yimise movha wakwe ekusuhi na Sepulveda Boulevard:** This is true, but not the *most* incorrect. The key event is being directed to the hospital.
*   **C: Muteki wa swifaniso u teke swifaniso swa maphorisa lawa a ma yimile:** The text says he *took* pictures *of* the police, not that the police took pictures of him.
*   **D: Muteki wa swifaniso u kote ku teka xifaniso xa Bieber:** This is incorrect. The text states he took pictures *of the police*.
"
Xana muteki wa swifaniso a ringeta ku endla yini a nga si chayisiwa hi movha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku teka swifaniso swa maphorisa lawa a ma yimile**.

The text states: ""TMZ website reported that the music artist stopped his car at Sepulveda Boulevard and took pictures of the police officers who were stopped in front of the accident scene and went to the officers, adding to their anger."" This directly supports option B.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku yimisa movha wakwe eka Sepulveda Boulevard** - While he *did* stop his car, this isn't the action that prevented him from being arrested.
*   **C: Ku tsemakanya patu leti nga bizi** - The text mentions an accident scene, not a house.
*   **D: Ku khorwisa phorisa leswaku ri n’wi pfumelela a hambeta a teka swifaniso** - The text doesn't indicate that he coaxed or bribed the officers. In fact, his actions angered them.



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga xi hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma xiyimo xa muungameri endzhaku ko kumiwa a ri na xitsongwatsongwana?,"The correct answer is **C: U le ka xiyimo xo antswa**.

The passage states: ""Ndzi titwa ndzi ri kahle naswona ndzi le ka xiyimo xa kahle leswaku ndzi tirha hi riqhingho."" This translates to ""I am feeling well and also have good health because I am working with a strong foundation.""  This indicates he has a *new* or *recovered* health condition.  Option C, ""U le ka xiyimo xo antswa"" (He has a recovering health condition) best reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A nga titwi kahle** (It cannot be said to be good) - While he might not be *perfectly* healthy, the passage emphasizes good health and recovery.
* **B: U twa ku vava ka nkolo** (He feels religious sorrow) - The passage doesn't mention religious feelings.
* **D: U ni mukhuhlwani** (He has a grudge) -  There's no indication of resentment or bitterness in the passage.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi ta muungameri hi xihi lexi nga ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **B: U ta tshama ekaya mavhiki ma nga ri mangani.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Muungameri u le ka xiyimo lexinene, hambileswi a nga ta tshamisiwa ekaya ku ringana masiku yo karhi."" This translates to: ""The congressman is seriously ill, and he will not be able to go home for an indefinite period.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A nga na mukhuhlwani (He has no headache):** The text says he is seriously ill, implying symptoms beyond just a headache.
* **C: U hanye kahle lerova a nga kota ku vulavula hi riqingho (He is well enough to speak about the situation):** The text says he's seriously ill, making this unlikely.
* **D: Wa tikeriwa swinene hikwalaho ka xitsongwatsongwana (He was seriously injured due to the illness):**  The text states he is *ill*, not *injured*.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana Xidzedze xa Gonu a xi languteriwe ku ya emahlweni xi hunguteka rini?","The correct answer is **A: Emahlweni ko fika eMaldives**

The passage states: ""Namuntlha nimixo, mheho wa kona a wu ri kwalomu ka 83 wa tikhilomitara hi awara naswona ku languteriwe leswaku **wu ya emahlweni wu hunguteka**.""  This directly indicates that it was predicted to reach a more active phase before reaching the Maldives.
"
Xana mimoya a yi ri eka rivilo rihi loko Xidzedze xa Gonu xi fikelela nhlohlorhi ya xona?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 wa tikhilomitara hi awara**.

The question asks about the speed of the wind when the Gonu cyclone reached its peak intensity. The passage states: ""Enhlonhlorhini ya xona, Xidzedze xa Gonu, lexi thyiweke vito ra xirhundzu xa matluka ya cindzu hi ririmi ra le Maldives, xi fike eka mheho lowu hungaka hi rivilo ra 240 wa tikhilomitara hi awara (149 wa timayili hi awara).""  This means the wind speed was 149 kilometers per hour (or 93 miles per hour) when it reached its peak.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki mukhuva wa Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **B: Xi nga onha misiha eka vanhu** (It can cause paralysis in people).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Nkuxu lowu wu endla tineurotoxin leti nga onhaka misiha eka vanhu ni tinhlampfi."" (The seaweed produces neurotoxins that can cause paralysis in humans and animals.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I muxaka wa nkuxe** (It is a type of seaweed): While true, this is a general statement and not the most specific consequence mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Xi na tisele to hlaya** (It has a healing property): The passage describes the negative effects of Karenia brevis, not any healing properties.
* **D: Xi humelela hi ndlela ya ntumbuluko** (It spreads through pollution): While pollution can contribute to its growth, the passage focuses on the neurotoxin as the primary issue, not its spread *through* pollution itself.

Therefore, **B** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Karenia brevis yi nga swi kotiki ku swi endla?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku humesa neurotoxin**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nkuxu lowu wu endla tineurotoxin leti nga onhaka misiha eka vanhu ni tinhlampfi.""  This directly translates to ""The jellyfish produces neurotoxins that can paralyze people and animals.""

While the other options are related to the jellyfish's effects, the passage specifically highlights the release of neurotoxins as a key consequence of its actions.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga vangiwangiki hi Xidzedze xa Felicia?","The correct answer is **B: Ku na ka mpfula loku fambisanaka ni ku dzindza ka tilo (Flash flooding)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Masalela ya xona ya endle mpfula yo tsutsuxa eka swihlala swo tala, kambe sweswi, a ku vikiwanga ku onhaka kumbe nkhukhulo. Ku na ka mpfula, ku fike eka 6.34 wa ti inci eka Oahu, ku hlamuseriwe tanihi loku “vuyerisaka”.""

The term ""vuyerisaka"" (flash flood) directly refers to a sudden and intense flooding event. The passage also mentions that the floods caused the ground to shake and there was a lot of debris.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ku na ka mpfula lokunene (Major flooding)** - While there was flooding, the passage indicates it wasn't severe enough to become major flooding.
*   **C: Ku hatima loku hambetaka (Ceasing of movement)** - The passage states the storm continued to move and was expected to continue moving.
*   **D: Ku tala ka mati eswitarateni (Thick rain)** - While rain was involved, the passage specifically points out the flooding and debris, indicating a more intense and dangerous event than just heavy rain.



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga ntiyiso malunghana na Xidzedze xa Felicia?,"The correct answer is **B: Eku sunguleni a yi tekiwa tanihi matimba ya xihuhuri xa thiropika ivi yi va xidzedze xa Xiyenge 4.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Felicia, a yi ri ri eka Xiyenge xa 4 xa xidzedze eka Mpimo Wa Swidzedze wa Saffir-Simpson..."" which translates to ""Felicia was initially classified as a Category 4 hurricane...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mpfula leyi neke yi pfune Oahu:** While the passage mentions flooding in Oahu, it's not the primary revelation or significant detail about Felicia.
* **C: Swihlala swo tala swi amukele mpfula:** The passage states that the initial flooding didn't cause significant damage or growth.
* **D: Mpfula yin’wana a yi fambisana ni rihati:**  The passage mentions other floods, but the key takeaway about Felicia is its initial categorization as a Category 4 hurricane.



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi kombisaka kahle vuyelo bya 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. u hlongoriwile endzhaku ka sweswo.**

Here's why:

The question asks what *revealed* the truth about the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. The passage states that Piquet Jr. was penalized *after* the race. This penalty was the revelation of the deliberate crash. The other options are either facts of the race (A & D) or a consequence of the crash (B), but not the revelation itself. The revelation was the subsequent investigation and punishment of Piquet Jr. for engineering a crash.
"
Xana khombo ro chayisa ri endleke rini?,"The correct answer is **A: Endzhakunyana ka loko Aloso wu yimile ku chela petirolo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Loko mimovha leyi a yi ri emahlweni ka Alonso yi nghena ku ya chela petirolo ehansi ka movha wa vusirheleri, u rhangele lava a va ri emahlweni kutani a hlula."" (When the cars in front of Alonso went in for petrol at the pit stop, he overtook those ahead). This directly links the overtaking to Alonso's pit stop.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi tekeke nkarhi wutsongo ku tlula lowu valavisisi a va wu ehleketa eku sunguleni?","The correct answer is **C: Ku tswala exikarhi ka swivumbiwa swo hambanahambana**.

Here's why:

The passage states the researchers observed the new species evolving from two distinct types of finches (Darwin's finches and cactus finches) due to competition for resources. This competition *forces* the evolution of different beak shapes adapted to exploit different food sources.  This process of developing different traits within a population is called the emergence of divergent or different types of variation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ku tumbuluka ka swivumbiwa** (Emergence of variations): While variations do emerge, the passage emphasizes that the *competition* drove the *differentiation* of these variations into distinct species.
*   **B: Ku vika hi ta swivumbiwa** (Becoming variations): This is too vague. The passage describes a specific *type* of variation driven by a specific environmental pressure.
*   **D: Hundzuluko wa swivumbiwa** (Change of variations): This is too general. The passage focuses on the *development* of new variations rather than a general change.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga vikiwangiki hi valavisisi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku leha ka endlelo ra hundzuluko (There is evolutionary pressure)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the researchers believe the new species evolved due to interaction with two different types of finches: *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza conirostris*.** This interaction, or competition and resource partitioning, creates *evolutionary pressure*. This means the environment (specifically, the presence of these other finches) drove the changes in the new species' beak morphology.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Laha xivumbiwa lexintshwa xi tumbulukeke kona (The new findings were disproven):** The passage doesn't suggest the findings were disproven.  It presents a hypothesis.
* **C: Vito ra swivumbiwa leswintshwa (The new species' traits):** The passage describes the traits of the new species but doesn't focus on their ""traits"" themselves as a problem.
* **D: Swinyenyana leswi katsekaka eku tswaleni (Mutations are rare in reproduction):** While mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation, the passage focuses on how *selection* (driven by the presence of other finches) acted *upon* those mutations, not on the rarity of mutations themselves.



Therefore, the most important factor the researchers are investigating as a cause of the evolution is the **evolutionary pressure** from the interaction with the other finch species.



"
Xana CowParade yi ta endliwa kwihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Eka Doroba ra Bucharest**.

The text states: ""Xiendlakalo xo navetisa swilo swa vutshila i tsima rin’wana ra Holo ya Doroba ra Bucharest ro lava ku pfuxeta ndhuma ya ntsindza wa Romania..."" which translates to ""A group of artists from the Bucharest City Hall are looking to host the Romanian Sheep Sculpture...""

Therefore, CowParade will be held in Bucharest.
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle CowParade?,"The correct answer is **C: I xiendlakalo xa vutshila lexi khomiwaka hi ximumu eka dzongavuxa bya Yuropa.**

Here's why:

* The first paragraph states that the Bucharest City Hall is organizing CowParade as a large-scale art event in the city.
* It also explicitly mentions that CowParade is a famous art exhibition that tours Europe.
* Option C accurately reflects both of these points.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi endliwa ntsena emadorobeni lama tekiwaka ma kota ku “sungula swilo”** (It is held in cities that are known to ""launch things""): While CowParade is held in many cities, this is a very general statement and doesn't capture the specific details from the text.
* **B: Yi sunguriwe hi Bucharest City Hall** (It is founded by Bucharest City Hall): While true, this is not as comprehensive as option C.  It doesn't highlight the larger European context.
* **D: I xiendlakalo lexikulu swinene xo navetisa swiloa vutshila emisaveni** (It is a very large art event that displays sculptures in the streets): This is partially true but doesn't mention the European touring aspect. Option C is more complete.



"
I yini lexi vangeleke Russia ku yimisa ku tirhisiwa ka ti-II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Khombo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Il-76 a yi ri xiphemunkulu xa masocha ya Russia na Soviet ku sukela hi va-1970, naswona yi ve khombo lerikulu le Russia n’hweti leyi hundzeke.""  This translates to ""The Il-76 has been the main military transport aircraft of Russia and the Soviet Union since the 1970s, and it has become a major problem for Russia and a problematic aircraft.""

The text then goes on to say that the crash on July 7th, where no one survived, led to Russia eventually halting the use of the Il-76.  The main reason for halting its use is the inherent *problem* (khombo) it presented.
"
I yini II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Xihahampfhuka (Aircraft)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Il-76 a yi ri xiphemunkulu xa masocha ya Russia na Soviet ku sukela hi va-1970..."" which translates to ""Il-76 is the main military aircraft of Russia and the Soviet Union since the 1970s...""

Therefore, Il-76 is an aircraft.
"
I mani loyi a hirheke xipanu xo tsala xa The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

The question states that Simon pitched *The Simpsons* with Brooks and Groening. While Simon was involved, Matt Groening is considered the creator of *The Simpsons*.
"
"Hikuya hi Fluke, i mani loyi a a n’wi rhumelela swibumabumelo leswinene ni xikhuthazo ?","The correct answer is **D: Vanhu va xinuna ni va xisati**.

Here's why:

The question states that Fluke relies on the testimonies of **women and girls** to obtain accurate information and support. 

* **Option A (Madokodela - Doctors):** While doctors might be involved in healthcare, the text specifically mentions the testimonies of women and girls.
* **Option B (Vayimeri va rihanyo ra vavasati - Female researchers):** Researchers might gather data, but the text emphasizes *testimonies* from women and girls themselves.
* **Option C (Vavanuna - Men):** The text explicitly states the focus is on women and girls, not men.
* **Option D (Vanhu va xinuna ni va xisati - Women and girls):** This aligns directly with the text's emphasis on women and girls providing crucial information.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini leswi vanhu van’wana a va nga lavi leswaku vavasati va vulavula ha swona?","The correct answer is **B: Swikoxo swa vutshunguri**

Here's why:

The question states that people *don't like* women talking about the details of their abortions because it brings up issues related to **reproductive rights** (rihanyo ra vavasati) and potentially involves **illegal abortion practices** (swikoxo swa vutshunguri - illegal clinics). The passage explicitly mentions the fear of legal repercussions.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vanhu va xinuna (Men):** While men may have opinions, the text focuses on the *reactions* of people to women discussing their abortions, not necessarily the men's feelings. It's not the primary reason they don't want women to talk about it.
*   **C: Rihanyo ra vavasati (Reproductive rights):** While related, reproductive rights are the *topic* of the conversation, not *why* people don't want women to talk about it.
*   **D: Fluke:** ""Fluke"" doesn't fit the context of the passage. It's an unrelated term.

Therefore, the passage implies that people are uncomfortable with women sharing their abortion stories due to concerns about illegal practices and the associated legal risks (""swikoxo swa vutshunguri"")."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi wihi miri wa pulanete lowu rharhanganeke?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hi ku tiva ka hina, ku na miri wun’we ntsena wa tipulanete lowu kombisaka ku cinca loku hundzaka Titan..."".  This translates to ""According to us, there is another planet that shows signs of a change in the atmosphere, and its name is Titan.""
"
Milambu ni mikova leyi nga ni xihalaki lexi voningelaka yi kumiwile eka miri wihi wa pulanete?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hi ku tiva ka hina, ku na miri wun’we ntsena wa tipulanete lowu kombisaka ku cinca loku hundzaka Titan..."". This means the change in the atmosphere is observed on Titan.
"
Eka leswi kumiweke hi xihi lexi nga vangiwangiki hi hundzuluko wa tinsiva?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku twisisa leswaku tinsiva a ti tirhiseriwanga ku haha.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xivumbeko xa tinsiva xi ringanyeta leswaku a ti nga tirhiseriwa ku haha kambe a ti pfuna ku lawula mahiselo kumbe ku bomba ha tona."" This translates to: ""The composition of the tooth suggests that it cannot be used to bite, but rather to control movements or pump."" This directly addresses the idea that teeth are not primarily for biting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Muvala wa voya bya xiharhi (Primordial blue color of the tooth):** The passage mentions the color but doesn't focus on it as something unexpected.
* **C: Ku twisisa hundzuluko wa tinsiva (Understanding tooth evolution):** While the evolution of teeth *is* discussed, the passage specifically highlights what is *unexpected* about the teeth's function.
* **D: Ku tiyisisa leswaku tidinasora to tala a ti ri ni tinsiva (Confirming that early dinosaurs had teeth):** The passage doesn't question the *presence* of teeth in early dinosaurs; it questions their *function*.



"
Xana tinsiva ta dinasora a ti pfumala yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Tirachisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...valavisisi va vule leswaku tirachisi swi nga endleka a ku ri nhluvukiso lowu teke endzhaku ka nkarhi wa hundzuluko eka tinsiva letin’wana."" This translates to ""...scientists have revealed that infections can occur as a result of a subsequent development after the disruption of other tissues.""

The passage also mentions other things associated with dinosaur fossils (like bone, and potentially skin), but the question specifically asks *what* the fossils themselves are made of.  The passage highlights infections (tirachisi) as a significant aspect related to the fossils.
"
Eka swivula leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana na ZMapp?,"The correct answer is **D: Tidyondzo ti komba leswaku vuyelo bya yona byi le hansi ka leswi a swi languteriwile eku sunguleni.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mpfangano wun’wana wo lwisana ni xitsongwatsongwana, ZMapp, eku sunguleni a wu tshembisa emhakeni leyi, kambe tidyondzo ta ximfumo ti kombise leswaku a wu nga vuyerisi swinene hilaha a swi languteriwa hakona eku siveleni rifu.""

This translates to: ""Another drug, ZMapp, which showed promise in the early stages, but clinical trials showed that it did not really work as well as it did in the early stages.""

Option D accurately reflects this clinical trial finding. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Yi endliwa hi ti-antibody:** While ZMapp *is* an antibody, the passage focuses on its *efficacy*, not its composition.
*   **B: Yi kota ku tshungula mitluleto leyi nga kona kambe a yi siveli rifu:** The passage states it *did not* effectively prevent infection.
*   **C: Yi tirha ku lawula eka ndzingeto wa PALM:**  The passage mentions the PALM drug but doesn't say ZMapp is used to treat it. It describes how ZMapp was researched in relation to PALM.



"
Eka swivula leswaku landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle ndzingeto wa PALM?,"The correct answer is **A: Tidyondzo ti komba leswaku yi nga ha va ni vuyelo byo tala ku tlula leswi a swi languteriwile eku sunguleni.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eka ndzingeto wa PALM, ZMapp wu tiaka leswaku van’wasayense va wu tirhise tanihi masungula ivi va wu ringanisa ni vutshunguri lebyin’wana byinharhu."" This means the PALM trial showed that ZMapp *might* have had an effect earlier than what was initially observed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xidzidzirisi xo lawula a xi pimanisiwa ni vutshunguri byin’wana, byin’wana bya kona i ZMapp** - While ZMapp *was* a control, the statement is incomplete and doesn't fully capture the PALM trial's finding.
* **C: ZMapp a yi tirhisiwa tanihi xisekelo xa ndzingeto** -  The passage indicates ZMapp was used *initially* as a starting point for further research, not as a primary treatment.
* **D: Yi tikombe yi tirha ku tshungula mavabyi lama nga kona** - The passage focuses on the effectiveness of ZMapp and the PALM trial, not on its ability to prevent infection.



"
Hi kwihi laha valavisisi va ehleketaka leswaku chipi leyintshwa yi ta va ya nkoka swona kona?,"The correct answer is **B: Matiko lama fuweke (Endemic regions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the chip is intended to combat diseases prevalent in ""matikweni laha vanhu va holaka mali ya le hansi, laha mpimo wa lava ponaka mavabyi yo tanihi khensa ya vele yi nga vaka hafu ya lava nga ematikweni lama fuweke.""  This translates to ""regions where people spend little money, where the prevalence of infected people, including those with cancer, can be as high as half of the people in endemic regions.""  ""Endemic regions"" refers to areas where a disease is constantly present.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Matiko ya miholo ya le hansi (Lower-income countries):** While related, ""endemic regions"" is a more precise term used in medical and public health contexts.
*   **C: Le United States:** The passage focuses on regions *outside* the United States.
*   **D: Le Yunivhesiti ya Stanford:**  The university is where the chip was developed, but it's not the target area for its application.



"
I endlelo rihi leri nga ta tirhisiwa ku endla xitirhisiwa xa vulavisisi?,"The correct answer is **B: Tipurintara ta ntolovelo ta inkjet**.

The passage states: ""...leyi nga endliwaka hi ku tirhisa tipurintara ta inkjet..."" which translates to ""...which can be made using inkjet printers...""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana na lobate scarps?","The correct answer is **A: Swiendlakalo leswi swi endleke kumbexana a hi khale swi humelerile** (The phenomena that happened were already tolerated in the past).

Here's why:

* The passage states that the scarps indicate a change in something that wasn't happening before.
* The conclusion is that there is evidence of a change in the planet.
* Option A directly addresses the *reason* for the scarps indicating change - that similar phenomena were tolerated previously.  This implies that the current change is significant because it deviates from the past.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vukona bya swona leswaku n’weti a wu pfumali ku cincacinca loku endlekaka eka n’weti** (The fact that the planet is not tolerant of changes in the planet).  This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. The passage *points to* a change.
* **C: Swi nga ha tshuka swi vangiwa hi ku tsongahala ka n’weti** (They might have been caused by the movement of the planet). While planet movement *could* cause scarps, the passage doesn't offer this as a direct explanation. The passage is focused on the *meaning* of the scarps as indicators of change.
* **D: A hi swo tala leswi kumiweke evuandlalweni bya n’weti** (These are the first things that have been found in the history of the planet). The passage implies these are *not* the first things found, as they represent a change from the past.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi wahi mavonelo malunghana ni xiyimo xa misava lexi kombisaka leswaku ku ni ku cincacinca ka swilo en’wetini?","The correct answer is **C: Ku ni xiyimo xa misava lexitsongo evuandlalweni bya n’weti**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what evidence points to changes in the ocean.** The passage states: ""Mavonelo lama, ya kaneta leswi swi vuriwaka swa ku a ku na ku cinca loku endlekaka eka n’weti."" (Therefore, the data collected has been interpreted as indicating changes in what is happening to the ocean.)
* **The passage links the changes to the ""scarps"" (sea floor scars).** It says the scars ""tikomba ti onge ti hlahlelekile katsongo, sweswo swi kombisa leswaku ku cinca loku a ku endlekanga khale."" (show that they are irregular, thus indicating a change from what used to happen.)
* **Option C directly reflects this connection.** It states that there is evidence of sea floor scars in the deep ocean, which *point to* changes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: N’weti lowu vuyelelanaka hakatsongotsongo** (The ocean is relatively deep) - This describes the environment, not the evidence of change.
* **B: Xiyimo xa misava i khale xi vumbekile** (The sea floor is old and stable) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes; the scars indicate instability and change.
* **D: Xiyimo xa misava lexi nga kona a hi khale xi humelerile** (The sea floor that might exist is stable) - Again, this contradicts the evidence presented.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi swihi leswi nga taka swi nga tali ku kondza ku andlariwa swihehlo?","The correct answer is **C: Mabulo ya vumbhoni bya lava swi voneke hi mahlo (Eyewitness testimony)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the reliability of eyewitness testimony is being questioned because the suspect's image was shown to witnesses *before* they gave their statements. This is a known factor that can contaminate eyewitness memory and lead to inaccurate recollections.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Swibumabumelo swin’wana (Other evidence):** While other evidence can be unreliable, the passage focuses specifically on the issue of eyewitness testimony and its vulnerability to contamination.
* **B: Ku kandziyisiwa ka swifaniso (Presentation of images):** This is related to option C, but option C is more precise. It's *how* the images were presented (before the statements) that caused the problem.
* **D: Ku kandziyisiwa ka tinhlokomhaka (Presentation of facts):** The passage doesn't discuss the presentation of facts or information to witnesses.

Therefore, the contamination of eyewitness testimony (eyewitnesses being shown images before giving statements) is the most direct cause hindering a conviction.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi nga riki xiphiqo eka lava lemaka?","The correct answer is **A: Maxelo yo biha swinene (The severity of the symptoms)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pittman u ringanyete leswaku swiyimo a swi nga ta antswa ku fikela nkarhi wo karhi vhiki leri landzelaka."" (Pittman believes the diagnosis cannot be made until the following week.) and ""hi ku ya hi Pittman, hi ku mpimo lowukulu eka lava lemaka emalembeni lama hundzeke ya 15."" (According to Pittman, the severity of the symptoms in the 15 patients is high.)

This indicates that the severity of the symptoms is a key factor in delaying diagnosis. The other options are related to the investigation or the type of illness but not the reason for the delayed diagnosis.

Therefore, the passage implies that the **severity of the symptoms** is preventing a diagnosis.
"
"Ku engetela eka ayisi, i yini xin’wana lexi kavanyetaka matshalatshala yo nyika mpfuno wo ponisa?","The correct answer is **B: Xiyimo xa maxelo (The scent of flowers)**.

The question asks what *else* is commonly found in plants that provide a healing fragrance, in addition to the scent of flowers. The passage states: ""Ku engetela eku fayeni ayisi, swiyimo swo biha swa maxelo swi kavanyete matshalatshala yo nyika mpfuno wo ponisa."" which translates to ""In addition to the scent of flowers, the healing scent of plants is commonly found in plants that provide a healing fragrance.""  Therefore, the answer is the scent of flowers.
"
Hi kwihi ku pfumela loku Roberts a aleke ku ku tiyisisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Nkoka wa vuavanyisi bya le Khotokulu lebyi fambelanaka**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hambiswiritano, yena, u kandziyisile eka marito yakwe leswaku Roe v. Wade a ku ri """"nawu lowu tiyeke wa ta misava"""", a kandziyisa nkoka wa vuavanyisi bya le Khotokulu lebyi fambelanaka."" This directly links his stance to the original decision of the Supreme Court.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku faneleka ko bula hi milandzu:** While the passage mentions Roberts believes in the foundations of life, this is presented as the *reason* he supports the court's decision, not the decision itself.
* **C: Masungulo ya vutomi:** Same as A, this is a belief that informs his decision, but isn't the decision itself.
* **D: Mfanelo yo hlayisa xihundla:**  While he believes in a right to privacy, the passage connects his stance *specifically* to the Roe v. Wade decision and the precedent set by the Supreme Court.  He doesn't just generally support a right to privacy; he supports its application in this specific legal context.



"
Hi yihi mhaka leyi Roberts a ehleketa leswaku a yi nga faneleki ku bula hayona?,"The correct answer is **B: Xiboho xa Roe v. Wade**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hambiswiritano, yena, u kandziyisile eka marito yakwe leswaku Roe v. Wade a ku ri """"nawu lowu tiyeke wa ta misava""""..."" This indicates that Roberts considers the Roe v. Wade decision to be something undesirable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vuavanyisi bya Khotokulu lebyi fambelanaka:** While he criticizes the decisions of the Supreme Court, the passage focuses specifically on his view of Roe v. Wade.
*   **C: Mfanelo ya xihundla leyi boxiwaka:** While he believes in a right to life, the question asks what he finds *unacceptable to let live*. The passage links his concerns to the Roe v. Wade decision.
*   **D: Vuxokoxoko bya milandzu:** This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Tiphuphu timbirhi ta rivoni ti voninga kwihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku kongoma exibakabakeni**.

The passage states: ""Hi ku kongoma ku miyerile ku ku whii edorobeni, ku nga nkarhi wo kongoma lowu xihahampfhuka xa nyimpi xi beke laha a xi hlasela kona."" which translates to ""There was a regular explosion in the city, at the time of the explosion of a military development that was placed there to attack.""

Therefore, the dreams saw the explosion **in the city**.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana miako leyintshwa ya swithezi yi akiwa rini endhawini ya kona?","The correct answer is **D: Ku aka ku ya emahlweni**.

The passage states: ""Ku karhi ku akiwa miako yo leha swinene leyintshwa ya ntlhanu endhawini yoleyo..."" which translates to ""It is time to build a new five-story building in that place..."". This indicates the building will be constructed *in the future*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ninhlikanhi (Never):** The passage clearly states a new building is planned.
*   **B: Hi 8:46 a.m. (At 8:46 a.m.):**  This is the time the speaker is speaking, not when the building will be constructed.
*   **C: Nivusiku (Nights):** This refers to the nights when the dreams were happening, not the construction time.



"
Hi rihi rungula leri ringanyetaka leswaku The Seven Sisters ku vuriwa mabako?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku cincacinca ka maxelo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Swifaniso swa infrared swi kombisa leswaku ku cincacinca ka maxelo ku suka nivusiku ku ya ninhlikanhi ku kombisa leswaku swi nga endleka ku ri mabako."" (Infrared comparisons show that changes in the amount of reflected light from night to day indicate that they might be asteroids.) This directly links the change in reflected light (changes in the amount of reflected light/changes in the amount of reflected light) to the possibility of them being asteroids.  While the other options are related to asteroids in general, they aren't the *reason* they are suspected to be asteroids according to this text.
"
Xana xiyimo xa mahiselo ya Seven Sisters xi langutisisiwa ku yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Swifaniso swa infrared**.

The passage states: ""Swifaniso swa infrared swi kombisa leswaku ku cincacinca ka maxelo ku suka nivusiku ku ya ninhlikanhi ku kombisa leswaku swi nga endleka ku ri mabako.""  This translates to ""Infrared comparisons show that the change in temperature from dusk to night indicates that they are likely asteroids.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi muehleketeleriwa?","The correct answer is **B: Ku ehleketiwa leswaku u fuhleke xibuluki (It is claimed he escaped the rope)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states the father was found tied up and injured.** This indicates he was likely restrained.
* **The question asks what isn't reliably revealed.** The police haven't confirmed *how* he was tied up, but the text *implies* an escape attempt by stating he was found tied up after a fall.
* **Option B directly addresses this uncertainty.** It states that it is *claimed* he escaped. This suggests it's not a confirmed fact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U tirhise movha enkarhini wa nhlaselo (He used a rope in the neck area):** The text doesn't specify *how* he was tied.
* **C: Rixaka ra yena ri tiviwa hi valawuri (His resistance was stopped by law enforcement):**  While he was found tied up, this doesn't explain *how* the tying occurred and is not explicitly stated as confirmed.
* **D: U vavisekile (He resisted):** The text mentions he was tied up and injured, implying resistance, but doesn't definitively state it as an undisputed fact.

Therefore, the claim that he escaped is the least reliably revealed information.



"
Hi rihi rungula ra nhlaselo leri valawuri va ri tiyisiseke?,"The correct answer is **D: Vito ni xivongo xa muehleketeleriwa (The name and appearance were registered).**

Here's why:

The question asks what the police used to identify the suspect. The text states: ""Vito ra yena a ri si tiviwa hi maphorisa, hambiloko va swi tiva leswaku i munhu loyi a nga ni xiphemu xa ntlawa wa Uighur.""  This translates to: ""His name was not prevented by the police, then they realized that he was a person who might have a Uighur-style headscarf.""

This indicates that the police identified the suspect based on his **name (Vito)** and his **appearance (specifically, the potential Uighur-style headscarf)**, which likely correlated with a registered appearance or known data. The other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Swihlawulekisi swa lava a a ri na vona (The belongings of those who have them):** The text doesn't mention any belongings being used for identification.
*   **B: Rixaka ra muehleketeleriwa (The type of clothing registered):** While the headscarf is mentioned, the emphasis is on the *appearance* and likely a registered characteristic associated with that appearance, not just the type of clothing.
*   **C: Lexi susumeteleke nhlaselo (This is a suspicious behavior):** The text mentions suspicious behavior (the act of killing), but doesn't say it was used for identification.



"
Hi swihi swipanu leswi nga ta tlanga eka ntlangu wa le Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti-Springboks na ti-All Blacks**.

The text states: ""Ntlango wa fayinali wa tiseries wu ta tlangeriwa eEllis Park eJoni vhiki leri taka, **loko ti Springboks ti tlanga na Australia**."" (The final match of the series will be played at Ellis Park next week, **where the Springboks will play against Australia**.)

While the text mentions All Blacks and Afrika Dzonga, the final match at Ellis Park features the Springboks and Australia.
"
Xana ti-Springboks ti ta tlanga kwihi ntlangu wa tona lowu landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Ntlango wa fayinali wa tiseries wu ta tlangeriwa eEllis Park eJoni vhiki leri taka, loko ti Springboks ti tlanga na Australia.""  Ellis Park is located in Johannesburg.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi xitichi xa swifambo swo ya empfhukeni xi veke ni xiphiqo haxona eka pfhumba leri?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hlayisa mpfhuka lowunene ku suka eka matimba ya njhini** (Dampening the engine power vibrations).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Chiao na Sharipov va vike leswaku i mpfhuka lowunene ku suka eka langutelo ro lungisa matimba ya injhini.""  This translates to: ""Chiao and Sharipov believed that the real vibration came from the engine power regulator.""  

The question asks what the vibration caused the aircraft's structure to shake.  The text directly links the vibration to the engine power regulator, implying that dampening *that* vibration would solve the problem.  Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku hlayisa gyroscope** (Dampening the gyroscope): The text doesn't mention the gyroscope being the source of the vibration or the solution.
* **C: Tirhelo ra jet** (Jet thrust): While jet thrust *can* cause vibrations, the text specifically points to the engine power regulator.
* **D: Ku kumisisa mpfhuka lowu tolovelekeke** (Stopping the tolerable vibration): The text indicates the vibration was *not* tolerable, but rather a problem needing to be fixed.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, a ku ri yihi pakani ya pfhumba ra xitichi xa swifambo swo ya empfhukeni?","The correct answer is **A: Ku kuma gyroscope leyi lahlekeke** (The loss of the gyroscope).

The passage explicitly states: ""Xitici a xi cincanga langutelo ra xona, hambileswi va lahlekeriweke hi gyroscope..."" which translates to ""The attitude indicator has lost its calibration, as it has been affected by a gyroscope...""

The other options are related consequences or observations, but not the *cause* of the attitude indicator's malfunction as stated in the passage.
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni nandzu?,"The correct answer is **C: Nawu wa ti imeyili leti tiviwaka tanihi spam wu tirhisiwile eka nandzu lowu.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what happened due to the misuse of inaccurate data.** The passage states that AOL's email harvesting practice, which collected email addresses for spam, was linked to the data breach. This means the inaccurate data (collected through spam harvesting) was exploited in the breach, leading to the vulnerability.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: U khomiwile eka mfumo wa ntsindza wa AOL (A system failure at AOL occurred):** While a system failure *could* have contributed, the passage directly links the data breach to the spam harvesting practice.
* **B: Ku khomiwe munhu (A person was hacked):**  The passage doesn't explicitly state that a person was hacked. It focuses on the data breach itself.
* **D: AOL yi hehliwile (AOL was sued):** The passage doesn't mention any lawsuits.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle nandzu lowu?,"The correct answer is **A: AOL yi hehliwile hi ku hangalasiwa loku nga hleriwangiki** (AOL was sued for illegal practices).

Here's why:

* The question states that the lawsuit stemmed from AOL's use of a ""web crawler"" starting in 2003 to collect email addresses for spam.  This is an illegal practice.
* Option A directly addresses the legal repercussions of this action.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * B:  The question doesn't mention the lawsuit targeting specific internet pioneers.
    * C: The web crawler started in 2003, so it wasn't discontinued in 2003.
    * D:  The question implies the crawler was used *without* user consent, not that AOL began using it for sign-ups.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xipanu lexi Vidal a sunguleke ku tlanga eka xona eka tinguva tinharhu leti hundzeke?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The text states: ""Vidal wa malembe ya 28 a a joyine Barça eka tinguva tinharhu leti hundzeke, ku suka eka suka eka Sevilla."" This translates to: ""Vidal, at the age of 28, joined Barça at a time when he was coming from Sevilla.""
"
Xana Vidal u tlange mitlangu yingani eka Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Vidal a tlange mitlangu ya 49 eka xipano xexo."" which translates to ""Vidal has played 49 games for the Spanish team.""
"
Hi xihi xipanu lexi a va tlanga na xona eka ntlangu wa kona?,"The correct answer is **A: Jarque**.

The passage states: ""Jarque a ri eku sunguleni ka nguva eCoverciano eItali eku sunguleni ka siku rero..."" which translates to ""Jarque arrived at the opening time in Coverciano, Italy, at the opening of the day...""  The question asks who he met *on the way* to the hotel.

The passage then continues: ""A a tshama eka hotela ya ntlawa emahlweni ka ntlangu lowu a wu kunguhateriwe Sonto ku lwisana na Bolonia."" which means ""He went to a hotel near the airport which was booked for Sonto to play against Bologna."" This describes where he went *after* arriving in Italy, not who he met *on the way*.

Therefore, Jarque is the person who is the subject of the passage and the most logical answer.
"
Hikwalaho ka yini Jarque a a tshame ehoteleni?,"The correct answer is **A: A a ri ni vuleteri**.

The sentence states: ""Jarque a ri eku sunguleni ka nguva eCoverciano eItali eku sunguleni ka siku rero. A a tshama eka hotela ya ntlawa emahlweni ka ntlangu lowu a wu kunguhateriwe Sonto ku lwisana na Bolonia."" This translates to ""Jarque arrived at the start time in Coverciano, Italy, on the day to start. He went to a hotel near the stadium where Sonto was hosted to play against Bologna.""

The phrase ""A a ri ni vuleteri"" means ""He received a letter"". The sentence indicates he went to the hotel *because* he received a letter. The other options don't directly follow from the text. He didn't have a meeting, he wasn't particularly interested in Sonto, and he didn't travel to Bologna *to* go to the hotel. He went to the hotel *to* be near where Sonto was playing.



"
Hikwalaho ka yini geophysics ya Jakarta yi nga humesanga xilemukiso?,"The correct answer is **D: A yi nga fikeleli mpimo lowu lavekaka wa ku tsekatseka ka misava.**

Here's why:

* **The question states the earthquake had a magnitude of 6.5.**
* **The response says the geophysics didn't detect a tsunami.**
* **The most likely reason for a geophysics station *not* detecting a tsunami from a 6.5 magnitude earthquake is that the earthquake occurred too far away or in a location where the energy wasn't focused in a way that generated a significant tsunami.**  Geophysics stations have limited range and sensitivity.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: A ku ri hava nxungeto wa tsunami:** This is the *result* of a tsunami, not the reason why it wasn't detected.
* **B: Ku papalata ku chavisa vaakatiko:**  While safety measures are important during earthquakes, this doesn't explain why a tsunami wouldn't be detected.
* **C: Ku papalata ku kavanyeta mabindzu ya ndhawu:**  This is irrelevant to the detection of a tsunami.



Therefore, option D is the most logical explanation.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana ku tsekatseka ka misava ku vangele yini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku chava eka vaakatiko (People evacuated)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...vaaki va sungule ku chava ivi va sungula ku siya mabindzu ni makaya ya vona."" This directly translates to ""People started evacuating and started collecting their belongings.""  This action is a direct response to the tsunami warning.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Nxungeto wa tsunami (Tsunami warning):** While the warning *caused* the evacuation, the question asks what people *did* as a result of the warning.
* **C: Ku humesiwa ka xilemukiso (Earthquake):** The earthquake was the *cause* of the tsunami warning, but the passage focuses on the *response* to the warning.
* **D: Mpimo wa ntikelo wa 6.5 (Magnitude of 6.5):** The magnitude is a factor in the tsunami warning, but the passage describes people's actions.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi susumetaka fambiselo ra Dyambu ni tinyeleti tin’wana hinkwato?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku vangama, nhlayo ya Rossby, ni ku rhendzelaka**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what *causes* the behavior of the Amundsen Low and other cyclones.** The passage explicitly states that:
    * ""Ku vangama ni ku rhendzeleka swi tirhisa swin’we ku kumisisa nhlayo ya Rossby..."" (Instability and vorticity are used to suppress the Rossby wave...) This indicates that instability and vorticity are contributing factors.
    * ""...Loko nhlayo ya Rossby yi ri yi tsanana, nyeleti yi ta va yi nga tirhi swinene malunghana ni timaginete leti yi ti humesaka."" (...When the Rossby wave is stable, cyclones cannot properly use meridional flow and the associated magnetic fields.) This directly links the Rossby wave's stability (or instability) to cyclone behavior.
    * ""Ku vangama ni nkhuluko wa pulasima"" (Instability and upper-level circulation) are mentioned as factors that influence the suppression of the Rossby wave.

Therefore, all three options (instability, Rossby wave, and vorticity) are linked to the Amundsen Low's behavior according to the passage.

"
Xana nhlayo ya nyeleti ya Rossby yi kumiwa njhani?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku vangama ni ku rhendzeleka**.

The passage states: ""Ku vangama ni ku rhendzeleka swi tirhisa swin’we ku kumisisa nhlayo ya Rossby ya nyeleti..."" which translates to ""Turbulence and instability are used to disrupt the Rossby wave of the jet stream...""

Therefore, turbulence and instability are the methods used to disrupt the Rossby wave.
"
I tiphesente tingani ta vanhu lava vutisiweke swivutiso lava seketelaka leswaku Australia yi va rhephabuliki xikan’wekan’we?,"The correct answer is **A: 31 wa tiphesente**.

The question asks for the percentage of people who *didn't* think Australia should become a republic. The text states: ""Eka tlhelo lerin’wana, 29 wa tiphesente ta lava vutisiweke va tshembha leswaku Australia yi fanele yi va rhephabuliki hi ku hatlisa, kambe tiphesente ta 31 ti tshemba leswaku Australia a yi fanelanga yi va rhephabuliki ni siku ni rin’we.""  This means 31% thought Australia should *not* become a republic.
"
"Hikuya hi Julie Gillad, xana Australia yi fanele ku va rhephabuliki rini?","The correct answer is **B: Endzhaku ka ku fuma ka Hosi ya Xisati wa Vumbirhi Elizabeth**.

The text explicitly states: ""Holobye Nkulu Julia Gillard u vule leswaku eka nhlawulo wa 2010 a a tshembha leswaku Australia yi fanele yi va rhephabuliki eku heteleleni ka ku fuma ka Hosi Ya Xisati Wa Vumbirhi Elizabeth.""  This means Julia Gillard believed Australia should become a republic *after* the death of Queen Elizabeth II.
"
Hi wihi nhlangano lowu lavisisiwaka hi va nawu,"The correct answer is **C: Planned Parenthood**.

The question asks which organization was criticized. The passage explicitly states that the Komen Foundation withdrew its funding from Planned Parenthood due to controversy surrounding Planned Parenthood's financial practices. The passage also mentions Representative Cliff Stearns criticizing Planned Parenthood.

Therefore, the organization criticized is Planned Parenthood.
"
Cliff Stearns i murhangeri wa komiti yihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Komiti Leyitsongo Ya Vukambisisi Na Vulavisisi**.

The text states: ""Stearns yi lavisisiwa hi swa nawu eka loko swibalo swi tirhisiwa ku hakelela ku susa kwhiri hikwalaho ka Planned Parenthood eka xiyimo xa yena tanihi **mutshama xitulu wa Komiti leyitsongo ya Vukambisisi na Vulavisisi**.""  This directly identifies the committee.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga endlekangiki eka wansati wa Muswiss?","The correct answer is **C: U pfinyiwile hi 5 wa vanhu (He was attacked by 5 people)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Swiss national was attacked by *five* people who were disguised as police.  The question asks what is *unlikely* to have happened.  The text confirms the attack by five people, making that the *likely* event, not the unlikely one.

Let's look at why the other options are possible:

*   **A: Nhundzu yakwe leyi yiviweke yi kumekile (His watch was stolen):** The text mentions the theft of the watch and laptop.
*   **B: U dlayiwile (He was injured):** The text mentions the victim was taken to the hospital.
*   **D: Foni yakwe ni laptop swi yiviwile (His phone and laptop were stolen):** The text confirms the theft of the phone and laptop.



Therefore, the *unlikely* event among the options is that he was attacked by 5 people."
Hi yihi khampani leyi nyikiweke Sagwadi ra 2007 ra Taiwan Sustainable?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""...ASUS yi nyikiwe sagwadi eka 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award..."" (ASUS was awarded the award in 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award...).
"
Xana ASUS Eee PC i yini?,"The correct answer is **B: I laptop**.

The text explicitly states: ""Khompyuta ya ASUS Eee, leyi eku sunguleni yi humesiweke emisaveni hinkwayo tanihi leyi xavekaka naswona yi tirhisekaka hi ku olova, yi ve hungunkulu eka 2007 Taipei IT Month."" This translates to: ""The ASUS Eee computer, which was released as a small, portable computer that works with a touch, was prominently featured at the 2007 Taipei IT Month.""  This describes a laptop.
"
I mani loyi a ri ni vutihlamuleri eku lahlekeni ka mapapila ya poso?,"The correct answer is **A: Vatirhi va le posweni (Post office workers)**.

The text states: ""Tolo, hofisi ya poso yi humese swikombelo swa ku rivaleriwa eka vanhu lava tshamaka eka ndhawu yoleyo na **vatirhi va le posweni** endzhaku ka ku kuma leswaku jaha ri tumbete mapapila wa poso yo tlula 600..."" (Initially, the post office released a complaint against people living in the area and **post office workers** after discovering that someone had stolen over 600 pieces of mail...).
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a humeseke xikombelo xa ku rivaleriwa hi mapapila lama lahlekeke?","The correct answer is **A: Vaaki va ndhawu yoleyo** (Residents of the area).

The text states: ""hofisi ya poso yi humese swikombelo swa ku rivaleriwa eka vanhu lava tshamaka eka ndhawu yoleyo..."" which translates to ""the post office has released a complaint against the residents of the area..."".
"
Hi rini laha Del Potro a bohekeke ku ongola kahle leri a ri n’wi karhata?,"The correct answer is **C: Eka sete ya vumbirhi (In the second set)**.

The passage states: ""Del Potro u nghene eka ntlangu wa vumbirhi a ri ka xiyimo xo antswa..."" which translates to ""Del Potro entered the second set in a tense situation..."" This implies the issue arose during the second set.
"
Vuyelo bya tie-break yo sungula byi ve byihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Del Porto u hlurile eka sete ya vumbirhi**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""Del Potro u nghene eka ntlangu wa vumbirhi a ri ka xiyimo xo antswa..."" which means Del Potro went to the second set and won.
"
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi ngopfungopfu a a ri ekusuhi ni muvabyi?","The correct answer is **B: Vana (Children)**.

The text states: ""Namuntlha, hi kume leswaku vana van’wana lava ringaniweke hi kuya exikolweni ku kumiwe leswaku va tihlanganise na muvabyi."" This translates to ""Today, it is reported that other children who have been taken to school have been found to have been in contact with the abuser.""



Therefore, the children are the ones who have been in contact with the abuser."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi swihi leswi mulawuri a nga swi tiyisisangiki loko a vulavula ni vaaki va Texas?","The correct answer is **C: Va lulamerile ku langutana ni ntlhontlho (They are being allowed to mingle and interact).**

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights concern about children mingling with strangers.** Perry specifically mentions the need to investigate ""places that might be conducive to interaction and abuse."" The statement ""Today, there are reports that other children have been found to have interacted with an abuser"" directly supports this concern. 
* **The passage implies that the current situation allows for inappropriate interactions.** Perry emphasizes the need to ""ensure that our approach is appropriate.""
* **Option C, ""Va lulamerile ku langutana ni ntlhontlho,"" directly reflects the concern that children are being allowed to interact with potentially dangerous individuals.** 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Fambiselo ri tirha kahle (The approach is working well):** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. The passage raises serious concerns about the current approach.
* **B: Swilo swa endliwa ku sirhelela vuhlayiseki bya rixaka (Things are being done to facilitate the movement of cross-cultural harm):** While there's a concern about harm, this phrasing is awkward and not directly supported by the text.
* **D: Mhaka leyi a yi na ntikelo (The tribe has a problem):** The passage doesn't mention any tribe or tribal issues. It focuses on the safety of children.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate reflection of what the speaker finds concerning and potentially inappropriate in their interactions with the public."
Hi wihi nongonoko wa mahungu lowu simekiweke hi khale ka swichudeni swa UW?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The text clearly states: ""Khale swinene loko nongonoko wa The Daily Show ni wa The Colbert Report wu nga si va kona, Heck na Johnson va ehlekete hi nkandziyiso lowu hlekisaka lowu a wu ta encenyeta mahungu—ni ku vika mahungu—loko va ha ri swichudeni eyunivhesiti ya UW hi 1988. Ku sukela loko yi sunguriwile, **The Onion yi hundzuke nhlangano lowukulu lowu encenyetaka mahungu**...""

The text then goes on to describe The Onion in detail. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga katsiwangiki eka nongonoko wa mahungu wa The Onion?","The correct answer is **C: Webusayiti**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ku sukela loko yi sunguriwile, The Onion yi hundzuke nhlangano lowukulu lowu encenyetaka mahungu, yi ni nkandziyiso lowu printiwaka, **yi ni webusayiti leyi kokeke rinoko ra vanhu va 5,000,000 hi n’hweti ya October**..."".

While The Onion also has articles (nkandziyiso) and eventually produced a world atlas (mepe wa misava), the question asks what *followed* the initial creation of The Onion, and the text highlights the webusayiti as a key development.  The other options are not directly mentioned as following the initial creation.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi a xi rindziwe hi maphorisa?","The correct answer is **C: Vungheno bya Downing Street**.

The text states: ""Hi 11:20, maphorisa ma kombele vakombisakuvilela leswaku va suka epatwini va yima etlhelo, va vula leswaku va boheka ku va pfumelela va kombisa ku vilela kambe a va fanelanga ku siva timovha."" This directly indicates that the police reported an incident at Downing Street.
"
Hi wihi nkarhi lowu maphorisa ma kombeleke lava kombisaka ku vilela ku suka leswaku nkhuluko wa mimovha wu nga tlheli wu kavanyeteka?,"The correct answer is **D: Hi 11:20**.

The text states: ""Hi 11:20, maphorisa ma kombele vakombisakuvilela leswaku va suka epatwini va yima etlhelo, va vula leswaku va boheka ku va pfumelela va kombisa ku vilela kambe a va fanelanga ku siva timovha."" This indicates that the police requested the parade to stop at 11:20.
"
Hi swihi leswi nga ntiyiso hi ndzavisiso lowu endliweke hi Dok. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **A: Vuyelo byi nga ha pfuna vavabyi lava nga ni vuvabyi bya chukela bya Type 1**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ku fana ni vativi van’wana, a nga tiyiseki kahle leswaku vuvabyi bya chukela byi nga tshunguleka, u vula leswaku leswi kumiweke a swi va khumbi vanhu lava va nga ni vuvabyi bya chukela bya Type 1.""  This means the study participants were likely individuals *without* Type 1 diabetes.  The lack of diabetes makes it difficult to definitively say if the ""sugar spikes"" are due to a lack of insulin, as would be the case in people with Type 1 diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Makondlo man’wana lawa a ma ri ni vuvabyi bya chukela sweswi a ma ha ri na byona vuvabyi bya chukela:** This contradicts the main point that the participants were *without* diabetes.
* **C: U ni ntshembo wa leswaku leswi kumiweke swi ta tisa murhi wo tshungula:** While the study found sugar spikes, the text doesn't state Dr. Ur *believes* they cause a dangerous condition. It merely points out the difficulty in determining the cause.
* **D: Makondlo man’wana lawa a ma nga ri vuvabyi bya chukela sweswi ma ni vuvabyi bya chukela:**  This is unclear and doesn't directly reflect the study's key finding.

Therefore, option A accurately summarizes the core takeaway from the text."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini leswi vilerisaka Dok. Ur?","The correct answer is **D: Loko makondlo lama nga riki na vuvabyi bya chukela ma ta tshamisa sweswo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dok. Ehud Ur, phurofesa wa vutshunguri eYunivhesiti ya Dalhousie...lemuukise leswaku ndzavisiso wa ha ri emasungulweni. Ku fana ni vativi van’wana, a nga tiyiseki kahle leswaku vuvabyi bya chukela byi nga tshunguleka, u vula leswaku leswi kumiweke a swi va khumbi vanhu lava va nga ni vuvabyi bya chukela bya Type 1. **Loko leswi kumiweke swi tirha eka vanhu lava nga ni vuvabyi bya chukela bya Type 1**""

This directly indicates that the researchers found that the lack of ketones and blood sugar levels are related. The lack of ketones and blood sugar levels are what are causing the issues. Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Loko swi ta koteka ku kuma murhi wo tshungula** - While the passage mentions ketones, it doesn't explicitly state that the researchers are discovering a way to *detect* them.
*   **B: Mavonelo ya vativi van’wana malunghana ni murhi wo tshungula** - This is too general. The passage doesn't focus on comparisons with other conditions.
*   **C: Mavonelo ya vativi van’wana malunghana ni murhi wo tshungula** - This is too general. The passage doesn't focus on comparisons with other conditions.



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma ku wa ka Xihahampfhuka xa CG4684?,"The correct answer is **C: Xihahampfhuka xi ringete ku phatsama kanharhu xi nga si wa.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...kambe ku yimisiwe xin’we. Kwalomu ka timinete ta khume emahlweni kova xi yima eka ku ringeta ka xona ka vumbirhi xi nyamalarile."" This translates to ""...but one was delayed. At that airport, the landing was stalled due to heavy rain.""  This indicates the Twin Otter encountered *engine failure* during the landing attempt.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Eku sunguleni xihahampfhuka a xi nga swi koti ku phatsama hikwalaho ka maxelo** (The aircraft did not attempt to take off due to weather):  The text says the landing was stalled, not that takeoff was attempted.
* **B: Xihahampfhuka xi wile endhawini ya le kule swinene** (The aircraft crashed in that location):  The text says it was delayed *during landing*, not that it crashed.  It was recovered and is now inaccessible.
* **D: Ku lavisisa xihahampfhuka lexi weke swi kavanyetiwile hi maxelo** (Recovering the aircraft that was stalled due to weather): While recovery *did* happen, the *reason* for the stall was the engine failure.

Therefore, the engine failure (causing the stall) is the most direct reason the aircraft wasn't able to successfully land. Option C best captures this.
"
I yini lexi vangeleke Xihahampfhuka xa CG4684 ku tshika xi nga ha phatsami?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndhawu yo phatsama eka yona a yi nga fikeleleki**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ti Twin Otter a ti ringeta ku yima eKokoda tolo tanihi swihaha mpfhuka PNG xihaha mpfhuka CG4684, kambe ku yimisiwe xin’we."" (Twin Otter aircraft were attempting to land in Kokoda to transport PNG cargo CG4684, but one was delayed.)
* **The text further describes:** ""...kambe ku yimisiwe xin’we. Kwalomu ka timinete ta khume emahlweni kova xi yima eka ku ringeta ka xona ka vumbirhi xi nyamalarile."" (...but one was delayed. At the airport, the landing approach was completely blocked.)
* **Finally:** ""Laha xi weleke kona ku kumekile namuntlha naswona a ku fikeleleki hi ku olova lerova maphorisa mambirhi va siyiwe ekhwatini leswaku va ya laha nghozi yi endlekeke kona no lava lava va poneke."" (What was observed there today is also inaccessible by landing two police choppers left on the ground because they went to assess the danger and evacuate people.)

The blockage on the landing approach prevented the aircraft from landing.  The fact that police choppers were needed to assess the danger implies a serious obstruction.  Therefore, the most likely reason for the delay (and the inaccessibility of CG4684) is a blockage on the landing approach, making the landing site inaccessible.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: A ku ri ni swihahampfhuka swin’wana swo hlaya emahlweni ka CG4684** (There are other aircraft blocking in front of CG4684): While possible, the text doesn't explicitly state this.  The primary issue appears to be the blocked landing *approach*.
* **C: Xihahampfhuka xi byeriwe ku kongoma eKokoda** (The aircraft was diverted to Kokoda): The text states the aircraft was *attempting to land* in Kokoda. There's no indication of diversion.
* **D: Ndhawu yo phatsama eka yona a yi nga fikeleleki.** (The area where it should land is inaccessible): This is the correct answer. The airport landing approach was completely blocked and inaccessible.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga ntiyiso hi Franciszek Kowal?","The correct answer is **B: Eku heteleleni a nga vavisekanga (In the turmoil, the window didn't open)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emahetelelweni, fasitere rin'wana ri tshovekile, naswona vanhu va sungule ku huma hi rona."" (In the turmoil, one window opened, and people started to evacuate through it.)  Franciszek Kowal says he *saw* this. He also mentions people were trying to open windows, but they weren't always working.  Therefore, the window he saw didn't open in the turmoil - that's why people didn't evacuate through it.  His statement implies it was stuck or jammed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U faye fasitere (He broke the window):** The passage doesn't mention him breaking the window.
* **C: U tshove xitshamo loko a ringeta ku huma (He opened the window when he tried to evacuate):** The passage says people started evacuating *because* one window opened, not because he opened it.
* **D: U vavisekile loko a ringeta ku tshova fasitere (He panicked when he tried to open the window):** The passage doesn't mention him panicking.  He simply observed the situation.

Hikwalaho ka yini swi tika ku vona ndlela leyi Xidzedze xa Thiropikali Danielle xi nga onhaka hayona?,"The correct answer is **A: Xidzedze xa vhumbiwa leswaku xi nga tshuka xi va bubutsa.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xidzedze, lexi kumekaka kwalomu ka 3,000 wa timayili ku suka eMiami, Florida, yi na moya wa 40mph (64kph). Va n’wasayense va le National Hurricane Center va vhumba leswaku Danielle yi ta kula yi va xidzedze lexikulu hi Ravunharhu. **Xidzedze xa vhumbiwa leswaku xi nga tshuka xi va bubutsa**.""

This directly links the potential path of the storm to its projected intensification and movement due to weather patterns. Options B, C, and D are not supported by the text.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi ta Xidzedze xa Thiropikali Danielle?","The correct answer is **B: Xi sungule eLwandle ra Atlantic**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Xidzedze xa Thiropikali Danielle, xidzedze xa vumune lexi nyikiweke vito hi 2010 eka nguva ya swidzedze ya Atlantic,yi endlekile evuxeni bya Lwandle ra Atlantic.""  (Tropical Storm Danielle, a tropical storm given a name in 2010 during the Atlantic hurricane season, occurred in the Atlantic basin.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndlela leyi xi onheke hayona eCaribbean a yi tiviwi:** The text *speculates* about where it might go (Caribbean or US), but doesn't state it's prevented from going there.
* **C: Xi nga tshuka xi hundzuka xidzedze lexikulu:** The text states scientists *predicted* it would become a hurricane, but doesn't confirm it *did*.
* **D: Xi le kusuhi ni ku fika laha ku tshamaka vanhu:** The text doesn't mention anything about it reaching populated areas.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, ku ringanyetiwa leswaku ku fanele ku endleka yini hi vuvabyi byi nga si hundzuka ntungu wa misava hinkwayo?","The correct answer is **A: Byi fanele ku hunguta ku dlaya ka byona** (They should be encouraged to avoid contact with it).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tidyondzo tin’wana ti ringanyeta leswaku vuvabyi lebyi byi fanele byi hunguta ku dlaya ka byona byi nga si va ntungu wa misava hinkwayo..."" (Other studies suggest that non-wild birds should be encouraged to avoid contact with it...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matitwelo ya kona ma fanele ma nga karihi** (Their behaviors should not be considered risky): The passage suggests the opposite - that certain behaviors *are* risky.
* **C: Ku fanele ku va ni vanhu vo tala lava tluletiwaka** (There should be a strict quarantine of those infected): While quarantine might be a measure taken, the passage focuses on *non-wild birds* and avoiding contact, not a strict quarantine of infected individuals.
* **D: Vana va fanele va kombisa ku khomiwa hi vuvabyi byebyo** (Children should show caution towards certain birds):  While caution is good, the passage specifies *non-wild birds* specifically.



Therefore, option A aligns perfectly with the information provided in the passage."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana bubutsa a ri ri ekule ku fikela kwihi na Fujian?","The correct answer is **B: 11 wa tikhilomitara**.

The question states: ""Malunghana ni vusiku bya August 9, tihlo ra Morakot a ri ri kwalomu ka tikhilomitara ta khume n’we ekule na xifundza nkulu xa Fujian xa le Chayina."" which translates to ""The tsunami hit on the evening of August 9th, and it was reported to have reached 11 kilometers from the main Fujian province in China.""
"
I mani loyi a xewete George W. Bush loko a fika le Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng na Lee Hsien Loong**.

The passage states: ""Xewetiwe hi Xandla xa Holobyenkulu le Singapore ku nga Wong Kan Seng ivi ku buriwa hi timhaka takwe ta bindzu ni ta vutherorisi swin’we na Holobyenkulu wa le Singapore ku nga Lee Hsien Loong.""  This directly indicates that Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong greeted George W. Bush.
"
Hi rini laha muungameri a vulavuleke kona hi ku ndlandlamuxiwa ka nxaviselano le Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Endzhaku ku lahlekeriwa kakwe eka nhlawulo wa le xikarhi**.

The text states: ""Bush u byele vayingiseri hi ta ku ndlandlamuxiwa ka nxaviselano na Asia. **Endzhaku ka vhiki ra ku lahlekeriwa eka nhlawulo wa le xikarhi**...""

Therefore, he announced the cooperation in Asia on the day after the working week ended.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka kwihi ku tiyimisela lokukulu ka hulumendhe?","The correct answer is **A: Ku xava makalichi lama engetelekeke hi March lembe leri.**

Here's why:

The question asks what *caused* the government's dissatisfaction. The passage explicitly states the government is dissatisfied *because* they discovered 300 inaccessible roads in March.  The other options describe the roads themselves or the investigation, but not the initial cause of the government's issue.
"
Xana hulumendhe yi tivise yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Va tiyimisele ku hunguta xiphiqo xa makalichi.**

Here's why:

* The question asks what the government *did*. The passage states the government ""hi hlela ku xava makalichi lama engetelekeke ya 300"" (planned to clear 300 illegal shacks) and ""nhlayo ya makalichi ma va 1,300 lama faneleke"".
* Option B, ""Va tiyimisele ku hunguta xiphiqo xa makalichi"" (They committed to clearing the shack area), best summarizes the government's action in response to the situation described.  The passage indicates a commitment to clearing the area, likely starting the process of planning and organizing the clearing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Va hlela ku xava makalichi lama engetelekeke ya 300:** This only states a *planned action*, not what the government has *done*.
* **C: Va hlela ku xava makalichi lama engetelekeke ya 1,300:** This is incorrect because the passage states only 300 illegal shacks were planned for clearing, while there were 1,300 in total.
* **D: Xiphiqo xa ku tala swinene xi ta lulamisiwa ku nga si hela March:** This speaks to a *timeline*, not the government's action.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rihi rungula leri tiviwaka?","The correct answer is **A: Mpimo wa nxungeto wu hungutekile** (The rate of the reaction has been exhausted).

Here's why:

The statement says: ""The reaction has been exhausted by a catalyst. Consequently, the rate of the reaction is not revealed by the change in the reactant concentration.""

This means the catalyst has used up all the reactants, so the reaction can't proceed further, and the concentration of reactants won't change. Therefore, the rate of the reaction is exhausted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nxungeto a wa ha ri kona** (The reaction has not occurred): The statement explicitly says the reaction *has* occurred and been exhausted.
* **C: Ku languteriwe nhlaselo** (A catalyst has been used): While the catalyst *was* used, the core issue is that the catalyst has exhausted the reactants.
* **D: Vutlhari byi tiyisisa leswaku nhlaselo wu ta nyanya** (The results show that the reaction will be exothermic): The statement doesn't provide information about whether the reaction is exothermic or not, only that it's exhausted.



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni u kombisa ku vilela?,"The correct answer is **B: Mihlawulo leyi tekeke nkarhi wo leha ku va kona yi vangele ku switereko.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Switereko swi koxe leswaku CEP a tshika ntirho."" (The opposition claims that the CEP did not fulfill its duties.)
* **It also links the opposition's claims to a cause:** ""Mihlawulo leyi tekeke nkarhi wo leha ku va kona yi vangele ku switereko."" (The electoral irregularities led to the opposition.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Khomixini ya muungameri a yi ri n’wangulo wa switereko** (The opposition is the leader of the opposition): While the opposition *is* the opposition, this doesn't explain *why* they oppose the CEP.
* **C: Switereko swi koxe leswaku CEP a tshika ntirho** (The opposition claims that the CEP did not fulfill its duties): This is true, *but* it doesn't explain the *reason* for their claim. Option B provides the reason (irregularities).
* **D: Switereko a swi pfa swi va ni madzolonga** (The opposition sees themselves as victims): While they might perceive themselves as victims, this isn't the central point the text is trying to make. The text focuses on the *cause* of their opposition.



"
I mani loyi a ringanyeteke leswaku CEP la hundzeke a tshika ntirho?,"The correct answer is **C: Khomixini ya muungameri (The Assembly of Deputies)**.

The text states: ""N’wheti leyi nga hela khomixini ya muungameri yi ringanyete ku tsala papila ro tshika ntirho eka CEP..."" which translates to ""A motion from the Assembly of Deputies called for the creation of a document to establish the CEP...""

Therefore, the Assembly of Deputies is the entity that initiated the process to establish the new CEP.

"Hikuya hi xitatimendhe, hi swihi leswi seketeriwiki hi USA Gymnastics endzhaku ka loko Nassar a khome vatlangi ku biha?","The correct answer is **C: Ku cinca loku lavekaka eka nhlangano**.

The text states: ""USA Gymnastics yi seketela vulavisisi lebyi tiyimeleke lebyi nga ha paluxaka ndlela leyi ku tirhisiwa ko biha ka xiyenge lexi hlamuseriwaka hi xivindzi hi lava poneke eka Larry Nassar leswi vangeke ku honisiwa ka swona nkarhi wo leha ni ku amukela ku cinca kwihi ni kwihi loku lavekaka ni loku faneleke."" This directly indicates that USA Gymnastics accepted changes to the organization.

While options A (tekeriwa timfanelo) and D (vulavisisi lebyi tiyimeleke) are part of the solution, they are *how* the changes are implemented, not the change itself. Option B (Ku simeka mbango wo nyikiwa matimba) is not mentioned in the text.
"
"Hikuya hi xitatimendhe, hi yihi pakanikulu ya USA Gymnastics na United States Olympic Committee ku ya emahlweni?","The correct answer is **C: Ku hlohlotela vulavisisi lebyi tiyimeleke**.

Here's why:

The passage states that USA Gymnastics accepted independent investigations and is committed to real change within the organization. It also mentions the need for independent oversight to ensure athlete safety and prevent future abuses.  This directly points to a focus on independent oversight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku paluxa swiendlo swo biha swa Larry Nassar:** While this was a major issue, the passage focuses on the *response* to the Nassar abuse, not the abuse itself.
*   **B: Ku hlohlotela ku tekeriwa timfanelo:** The passage says USA Gymnastics is committed to real change in the selection process, but the main emphasis is on independent oversight.
*   **D: Ku simeka mbango lowu sirhelelekeke wa vatlangi:** The passage states the goal is to create a safe and empowering environment for athletes, not to maintain a problematic one. They are aiming for change.



"
Xana xikepe a xi ya kwihi loko mhangu yi humelela? ,"The correct answer is **D: Japan**.

The passage states: ""Muxaka wa xikepe xa nhlaselo xa Avenger, a xi ri endleleni yo kongoma le Puerto Princesa e Palawan. Swi averiwe eka U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet naswona swi kumeka le Sasebo, Nagasaki e Japani."" This translates to: ""The Avenger-class destroyer fleet was on its way to Puerto Princesa in Palawan. It was also reported that the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet was in Sasebo, Nagasaki in Japan.""

Therefore, the ship was in **Japan** when the event occurred.
"
Hi swihi leswi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni xikepe leswi boxiweke eka xiyenge lexi?,"The correct answer is **A: A xi kongome ePuerto Princesa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Muxaka wa xikepe xa nhlaselo xa Avenger, a xi ri endleleni yo kongoma le Puerto Princesa e Palawan."" which translates to ""The Avenger destroyer's disturbance was on the way to intercept in Puerto Princesa in Palawan.""
"
I mani loyi a rhumeleke xitatimendhe malunghana ni mavuthu ya US?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage states that Donald Trump, the President of the United States, initiated the withdrawal of US troops from Syria. Therefore, he is the one who issued the directive.
"
"Hikuya hi xitatimendhe, hi rihi tiko leri byarheke vutihlamuleri byo rindza vabohiwa lava lwaka?","The correct answer is **A: Syria**.

The passage states: ""Turkey a ri tlhela ri rindza vabohiwa lava lwelaka ISIS **lava lwelaka**"" which translates to ""Turkey will continue to seek out ISIS fighters **who are located in** Syria"". Therefore, Syria is the location where these fighters are found.
"
Xana ku ehleketiwa leswaku i yini lexi wiseke xihahampfhuka?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndzilo lowukulu**.

The question asks what is suspected to have caused the situation. The text states: ""Mhangu leyi yi endleke etintshaveni naswona ku ehleketiwa leswaku yi vangiwe hi ndzilo lowukulu."" This translates to: ""The damaged grain in the fields is also being investigated as being caused by the warlord."" Therefore, the warlord is suspected of causing the disruption.
"
Xana xihahampfhuka xi we eka ndhawu ya njhani?,"The correct answer is **A: Leyi nga fambekiki (Unreachable)**.

The passage states: ""Matshalatshala yo lava ndhawu ya mhangu ma siveriwa hi maxelo yo biha ni ndhawu leyi **nga fambekiki**.""  This translates to ""The land searching for grain was silvered by threshing floors and an **unreachable** place.""
"
Xana vatirhelamfumo va langutele yini hikwalaho ka ndhambi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tlheriseriwa ka sava**.

The text states: ""Matilo lawa a ma laveka leswaku ku akiwa risava ni mabuwa..."" (These findings showed that a wall and rubble were found...). The engineers hoped the wall would collapse and allow the floodwaters to recede.

While the other options are details of the findings, the *reason* the engineers were hopeful was the potential collapse of the wall. Therefore, option A is the most direct and accurate answer.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi khumbiweke hi ku akiwa ka damu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku akiwa ka sava (The formation of a dam)**.

The passage states: ""Matilo lawa a ma laveka leswaku ku akiwa risava ni mabuwa..."" which translates to ""These samples were found to show the formation of a dam and sediments...""

While the other options (B, C, and D) are *part* of the findings, the overarching event that happened *because* of the dam's formation is the dam itself.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nyikeke rungula eka United States hi ta mihlaselo leyi a yi ehleketeleriwa?","The correct answer is **A: Vapfukeri va le Somalia**.

Here's why:

The text states that the U.S. accused ""Somali militants"" of orchestrating the attacks.  Therefore, the Somali militants are the ones who are suspected of being responsible and thus, the ones the U.S. is referring to when mentioning those who orchestrated the attacks.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vuyimelatiko bya le Ethiopia:** The text accuses *militants* of orchestrating the attacks, not the Ethiopian government.
* **C: Xihlovo lexi nga paluxiwangiki:**  This refers to the attack itself, not the perpetrators.
* **D: Xihlovo xa le Kenya:** This refers to the location of the attacks, not the perpetrators.



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle rhengu ro hlasela leri ehleketiwaka ra vapfukeri?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku fuhleka tibomo etindhawini ta nkoka ematikweni mambirhi**.

Here's why:

The question asks where the bombings occurred. The provided text explicitly states that the bombings occurred in **Kenya and Ethiopia**. Option C is the only one that reflects this information.
"
Eka vanhu lava landzelaka hi wihi loyi a nga riki mutivi wa nawu?,"The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hikwalaho ka sweswo, ku pfuke swiswolo leswikulu eka ntlawa wa vativi va nawu va le Greece hi ku paluxiwa ka swiendlo leswi nga riki enawini leswi Vaavanyisi, vativi wa nawu, vadyeleri ni vagqweta va swi endleke hi nkarhi wa malembe lama hundzeke.

This translates to: ""Therefore, great turmoil erupted among the supporters of the victims in Greece due to the revelations of the acts committed by the Victims, their relatives, and associates over the past months. Weeks later, after the information disclosed by journalist Makis Triantafylopoulos on his popular television show """"Zoungla"""" on Alpha TV, **member of Parliament and lawyer, Petros Mantouvalos was implicated in the riots and violence.**""



"
Hi wihi ntlawa wa vanhu lowu nga boxiwiki tanihi xiphemu xa vudyeleri eka ntlawa wa vativi va nawu va Magiriki?,"The correct answer is **A: Vadyeleri**.

The question asks who is causing the biggest stir among the supporters of Greek football. The text states: ""Hikwalaho ka sweswo, ku pfuke swiswolo leswikulu eka ntlawa wa vativi va nawu va le Greece hi ku paluxiwa ka swiendlo leswi nga riki enawini leswi **Vaavanyisi, vativi va nawu, vadyeleri ni vagqweta** wa swi endleke hi nkarhi wa malembe lama hundzeke.""

This translates to: ""Therefore, a big stir has erupted among the supporters of Greek football due to the scandalous actions of **fans, supporters, players and coaches** that have taken place over the past few months.""

The question specifically asks about the *biggest* stir, and the text identifies **Vadyeleri (players)** as being among those causing this stir. While all the listed groups are involved, the context suggests the players' actions are a major source of the controversy.
"
Xana India yi lahlekeriwe hi tiwiketi tingani?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The question states: ""endzhaku ka ku humesiwa ka mukaputeni wa le India loyi endleke tirhani ta 36 ntsena ivi ku humesiwa tiwiketi ta 7 ku heta ntlangu.""  This translates to ""after the captain of India was dismissed for 36 runs, 7 wickets fell.""

Therefore, India lost 7 wickets.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, a ku ri xihi xikoro xa le henhla ka ntlangu?","The correct answer is **C: 100 wa tirhani**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""Robin Uthappa u fikelele xikoro xa le henhla xa ntlangu, tirhani ta 70 hi tibolo ta 41 hi ku kora tifo ta 11 ni tisikisi ti-2. Mutlangi wa le xikarhi, Sachin Tendulkar na Rahul Dravid, va tlange kahle naswona va khomisane ku hlengeleta tirhani ta **dzana**.""

This translates to: ""Robin Uthappa reached the highest score in the match, 70 runs off 41 balls with 11 fours and 2 sixes. The middle order batsmen, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, also well completed the innings of **hundred**.""

Therefore, the highest score in the innings was 100 runs.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xivangelo xa ku pfilunganyeka ka Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **D: Mavunwa malunghana ni ku susiwa ka swifaniso swa vutshila.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pfilunganyeka ka rixaka ku vangela matshalatshala ya sweswi yo andlala pholisi malunghana ni lava tameleke ta masangu eka xivandla lexi rhurhelaka timiliyoni ta mahungu lama nga ni layisense ya mani na mani."" This translates to: ""Copyright infringement is causing incidents where police and copyright agents are involved in a phenomenon that is costing millions of pounds of unlicensed content.""

Option D directly reflects this:

*   **Mavunwa malunghana (Legal action):** Refers to police involvement.
*   **Ku susiwa ka swifaniso swa vutshila (Seizures of infringing material):** Refers to copyright agents' actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pholisi leyintshwa ya xivandla xexo malunghana ni hungu ra swa masangu (New police incidents and drug seizures):** While police are involved, the text doesn't mention new police incidents or drug seizures specifically. It focuses on copyright infringement incidents.
*   **B: Ku susiwa ka swifaniso swa vutshila hi Wales (Seizures of infringing material in Wales):** The text mentions Wales as a location where this is happening but doesn't state that seizures are only happening in Wales.
*   **C: Ku pfumala ku yingisiwa hi Wales (An increase in piracy in Wales):** The text mentions piracy happening in Wales, but it doesn't confirm that piracy has increased there.

"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi susiweke exivandleni xexo?","The correct answer is **B: Leswi tameriweke timhaka ta masangu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ku pfilunganyeka ka rixaka ku vangela matshalatshala ya sweswi yo andlala pholisi malunghana ni lava tameleke ta masangu..."" (Racial unrest causes incidents of violence leading to police intervention and the involvement of law enforcement).

While the other options are related, the most direct and specific answer is the involvement of law enforcement (tameleke ta masangu).  The text focuses on their reaction and involvement.  ""Swifaniso swa vutshila"" (racial stereotypes) are a cause, not what was ""susiweke"" (removed or addressed) in the context of the unrest. The text is about the *response* of the police and law enforcement, not about the stereotypes themselves. While ""ku andlariwa ka pholisi"" (police intervention) is a consequence, it doesn't directly answer what's being removed from the situation. ""Vaviki va mahungu lava tiyimeleke"" (independent money brokers) aren't mentioned in the text.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Amir Khan a nga xi seketeliki?","The correct answer is **B: Vaphikizani va Britain**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan believes he will compete against British fighters at the 2012 Olympics in London.  The last sentence confirms this: ""...u ta seketela vaphikizani va Britain eka Tiolimpiki ta 2012 leti nga ta khomeriwa eLondon."" (He is going to compete against British fighters at the 2012 Olympics to be held in London.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku katsa vavasati lava lwaka eka Tiolimpiki:** The passage doesn't mention anything about lightweights.
* **C: Mavonelo ya vavasati:** The passage focuses on Khan's belief in his own ability and competing against other fighters.
* **D: Ku va London yi rhurhela Tiolimpiki:** This is a statement of fact but not what Khan is *expecting* to happen in his career.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Amir Khan a nga ta xi seketela swi nga ri na mhaka leswaku mavonelo yakwe hi wahi?","The correct answer is **B: Vaphikizani kulobye va Tiolimpiki ta 2004**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Amir Khan felt he wasn't recognized for his achievements, implying he felt overlooked compared to others.
* He then states he *will* beat British fighters at the 2012 Olympics. 
* The connection is that he feels he needs to prove himself against his peers and potentially those who might have been favored over him in the past (like British fighters he feels he's been slighted by).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vaxisati lava lwaka:** While the passage mentions female boxers, Amir Khan's statement is not directly related to them.
* **C: Tiolimpiki ta 2012:** This is the *event* he aims to excel in, not who he aims to defeat.
* **D: Vaamukeri van’wana va timedali ta silivhere:**  The passage focuses on his personal feeling of being overlooked and his desire to prove himself, not on other silver medalists.



"
Xana Peter Lenz u fe rini?,"The correct answer is **B: Endzhaku ko wa eka xithuthuthu xakwe.**

The passage states: ""Peter Lenz, wa 13-wa malembe hi vukhale loyi a nga eka mphikizano wa swithuthuthu, u file endzhaku ko katseka eka ngozi eka Indianapolis Motor Speedway."" which translates to ""Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old boy who was participating in a car race, died after being hit by a car at Indianapolis Motor Speedway."" 

While he was found at the track (C), the question asks *when* he died, and the passage specifies it was *after* being hit by a car. Option A is incorrect because the passage states he died *after* the accident, not during the crash. Option D refers to the presence of other people, not the time of his death.
"
Xana Xavier Zayat i mani?,"The correct answer is **A: I mutirhi wa vutshunguri wa le mphikizanweni (A race car driver)**.

The text states: ""Loko a ha ri eka xiyenge xo tiolola, Lenz u wile eka xithuthuthu xa yena, kutani a tlumbiwa hi mutlangi kulobye Xavier Zayat."" This translates to: ""When he wasn't in the race car, Lenz climbed into his car, and was struck by another driver named Xavier Zayat.""  Therefore, Xavier Zayat is identified as a race car driver.
"
Hi le ka xiyimo xihi laha muhahisi loyi a chuheke a nga tshukaka a vuyeriwa hi ku twisisa matirhelo ya xihahampfhuka?,"The correct answer is **B: Loko ku nyenya ka vona ku haha swi vangiwa hi ku chava leswi a nga swi tiviki.**

Here's why:

The passage describes how snake bites often occur when people are attempting to use snakes in rituals or when they are careless due to potential danger. Option B directly addresses this scenario:  snake bites occur when people try to handle snakes that are not docile/tame (a common reason for bites).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Loko mukhandziyi a khomiwa hi tingana hi ku chava kakwe:** While a snake might bite defensively if cornered, it doesn't directly address the primary reason for most snake bites (carelessness or trying to use them).
* **C: Loko mukhandziyi a chava mixaka hinkwayo ya vutleketli:**  Biting due to trying to handle different snake species isn't the *core* reason emphasized in the passage. The passage is more about general carelessness and attempting rituals.
* **D: Loko ku vilela ka vona ku vangiwa hi swilo leswi chavisaka leswi nga yelaniki ni ku haha:** This is a very broad and less specific explanation. While related, it's not as directly linked to the risk of snake bites as option B is.



Therefore, option B best aligns with the passage's explanation of why people get bitten by snakes.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi mufambi loyi a rhandzaka ku pimanisa mitsengo a fanelanga a hetelela hi xona ku xi endla?","The correct answer is **A: Ku secha mitsengo yo hambanahambana ya tikhampani ta swihahampfhuka** (Research different car dealership prices).

Here's why:

* **The problem:** The question states the person can't negotiate effectively because they don't know the dealership's pricing.
* **Why A is correct:** Researching prices at other dealerships gives the person a baseline and allows them to know what a fair price is. This knowledge is crucial for effective negotiation.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Ku buka xihahampfhuka eka khamphani ya xona** (Buy a car from their own dealership): This is the *opposite* of what the question is addressing. The person wants to negotiate a better price, not just buy from their own dealership.
    * **C: Ku pimanisa mitsengo exikarhi ka tikhampani to hlaya ta swihahampfhuka** (Negotiate prices at the dealership after a while): Negotiation *requires* knowing the starting prices. You can't negotiate effectively without that information.
    * **D: Ku kamba webusayiti ya xihahampfhuka** (Browse the car dealership website): While browsing the website is *part* of researching prices, it's not sufficient on its own.  You need to compare those prices to other dealerships.



Therefore, researching prices at other dealerships is the most logical and effective step for the person to take.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini leswi vakhandziyi va rhangaka va swi endla leswaku kuma mitsengo leyinene ya swihahampfhuka?","The correct answer is **B: Ku pimanisa mitsengo exikarhi ka tiwebusayiti leti longoloxaka mitsengo.**

Here's why:

The problem states that the company's website doesn't show accurate prices, and the prices can vary. This suggests the company isn't transparent about its pricing.  Therefore, a savvy shopper would need to compare prices from different websites that *do* show the actual prices.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ku kamba webusayiti ya xihahampfhuka (Visiting the car rental website):**  The problem explicitly says the website is unreliable and doesn't provide accurate prices.
* **C: Ku buka eka khampani ya xihahampfhuka hi ku kongoma (Booking directly with the car rental company by negotiating):** While negotiation *might* help, it's not the primary method for finding the *true* price when the website is inaccurate.
* **D: Ku buka eka muyimeri wa xihahampfhuka hi ku kongoma (Booking through a car rental agent by negotiating):** Similar to option C, negotiation could help, but it doesn't address the underlying issue of inaccurate pricing on the company's official website.



"
Xana muheleketi u boheka rini ku fambisana ni ndzhwalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko swilo swi rhumeriwa hi xihahampfhuka** (When goods are shipped via air freight).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tikhamphani to fambisa mindwalo ti hakeriwa mali ya kahle leswaku ti fambisa mindwalo hi ku hatlisa. Hakanyingi, nkarhi i wa nkoka eka mabindzu ya matsalwa, nhundzu, kumbe ti phatsi to lunghisa. Eka tindlela tin’wana, tikhamphani letikulu ti na swihaha mpfhuka swa tona, **kambe eka tindlela tin’wana na tifeme letitsongo a ku ri na xiphiqo. Loko va rhumela swilo hi swihaha mpfhuka, eka tindlela tin’wana a swi ta teka masiku ku chicha na mikhuva.**"" (Companies that ship goods are rewarded well for shipping goods quickly. Often, time is needed for customs, inspections, or repairs. In other ways, large companies have their own air freight, **but in other ways and small companies have delays. When goods are shipped via air freight, in other ways it can take days to arrive.**)

This clearly links air freight to faster shipping. The other options are not directly supported by the passage.

"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, loko u hlawula xihahampfhuka lexi u Fambaka hi xona Nkarhi Hinkwawo, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi u fanele u xi rhangisa emahlweni?","The correct answer is **A: Xihahampfhuka lexi nyikaka tipoyinti to tala**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that when choosing a tool for a specific task, you need to consider the potential for different types of tools to perform differently and that older tools might not be suitable. The key takeaway is that you should prioritize tools that have a good track record or have been used successfully before.

Let's break down why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Xihahampfhuka lexi tirhisiwaka ngopfu:** While frequency of use can be a factor, it doesn't directly address the importance of a tool's reliability and suitability for the *specific* task at hand, especially considering the potential for variation.
*   **C: Xihahampfhuka lexi u fambaka ha xona ko tala:** This is the opposite of what's being advocated. The passage suggests *not* relying solely on familiar tools, but rather considering the best tool for the job.
*   **D: Xihahampfhuka lexi nga engetelaka malunghana man’wana:** This is not a primary concern according to the passage. The main focus is on selecting a tool based on its ability to perform the task effectively and considering potential differences in tool behavior.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical conclusion based on the passage's emphasis on experience and suitability. A tool that has been used successfully before is more likely to deliver the desired results."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a nyika tipoyinti to tala to famba hi xihahampfhuka?","The correct answer is **D: Xihahampfhuka xin’wana eka ntlawa lowu fanaka** (Another type of balloon in the patterned ceiling).

Here's why:

The passage states that due to the changing patterns and different colors, you need to be careful to distinguish between different balloons.  This implies that *any* balloon present in the patterned ceiling could potentially be a ""first-place"" winner, not just a specific type.  Option D reflects this general possibility.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Xihahampfhuka xin’wana xa ntlawa lowu hambaneke** (Another type of balloon in the patterned ceiling): While partially correct, it's too specific. The passage doesn't limit it to just ""another type.""
* **B: Xihahampfhuka lexi u fambaka ha xona ngopfu eka ntlawa lowu fanaka** (The balloon that travels most often in the patterned ceiling): The passage emphasizes the challenge of *identifying* the winner, not necessarily which balloon is the *most* frequently moving.
* **C: Xihahampfhuka lexi u fambaka ha xona ngopfu eka ntlawa lowu hambaneke** (The balloon that travels most often in the patterned ceiling): Same reasoning as B.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka switwi leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga tsanisiwaka hi ku byalwa ku tlula mpimo?","The correct answer is **C: Nantswo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kombo swinene loko munhu a n'wa byalwa lebyi nga riki nawini."" (It's a serious problem when someone eats mushrooms that shouldn't be eaten.)

It then explains that these mushrooms contain substances that are harmful, causing nausea, vomiting, and even potentially fatal organ damage.  It *doesn't* specify what happens *after* eating them. It only highlights the dangers of eating them.

Therefore, the answer is that the passage doesn't mention anything about what happens after consuming poisonous mushrooms.



"
"Hilaha swi boxiweke hakona eka xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga kotaka ku hunguta vuyelo lebyi vavisaka bya byalwa?","The correct answer is **A: Ku nwa byalwa lebyi nga na methanol**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that spirits without methanol are safe to drink.  The danger comes from spirits containing methanol, which can cause blindness and other serious health problems.
* Options B and C are incorrect because the text says spirits *with* methanol are dangerous, and drinking alcohol at a reasonable rate is fine (up to a point).
* Option D is irrelevant to the question about what prevents alcohol poisoning.



"
Xana ntsengo wa miako yi le ka xiyimo xihi eka leyi tlakukeke le Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **B: Eka ndhawu yihi ni yihi endliweke UNESCO World Heritage Site**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Xifundza hinkwaxo xi endliwe ndhawu ya UNESCO World Heritage Site hikwalaho ka ndhavuko ya xona lowu hambaneke na matimu, na miako ya xona ya vitana swinene eka miako ya tiko hinkwaro.""  This translates to: ""The area has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its unique history and architecture, and its centuries-old cultural heritage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xifundza xa Canal (Canal District):** This is *what* is being referred to, not the reason for its importance.
* **C: Tindhawu leti susiweke eka Binnenstad (These historical places in Binnenstad):** While the Canal District is in Binnenstad and is historical, this option is too general. The text points to the UNESCO status as the key reason for its significance.
* **D: Tindhawu leti nga ni ntikelo wa matimu (These places that have no artistic value):** The text *directly contradicts* this, stating that its ""unique history and architecture"" are part of its significance.



"
Hikwalaho ka yini Xifundza xa Canal xi endliwe UNESCO World Heritage Site?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntikelo wa xona wa matimu ni mfuwo (Its unique historical character and layout)**.

The text states: ""Xifundza hinkwaxo xi endliwe ndhawu ya UNESCO World Heritage Site hikwalaho ka ndhavuko ya xona lowu hambaneke na matimu, na miako ya xona ya vitana swinene eka miako ya tiko hinkwaro.""

This translates to: ""The area was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its unique historical character and layout, and its long history dating back to the 17th century.""

Therefore, option A best reflects the reason for the UNESCO designation.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi endlaka ku endzela Phnom Krom swi va swa nkoka?","The correct answer is **A: Ku vonakala ka yona loko u ri le Tonle Sap**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Atimosifiye leyi baseke ya tempele na ku vona tiva ya Tonle Sap yi endle u nga tisoli hi ku khandziya ntshava.""  This translates to: ""The base atmosphere of the temple and seeing the Tonle Sap lake makes you want to gasp."" This directly links the experience of seeing Phnom Krom to being near Tonle Sap.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku famba ku suka le Angkor Pass:** While you might need an Angkor Pass to visit Angkor, the passage doesn't connect Phnom Krom's importance to the Angkor Pass.
* **C: Ku vona Siem Reap:** Phnom Krom is *near* Siem Reap, but the passage emphasizes its connection to Tonle Sap, not the city of Siem Reap itself.
* **D: Riendzo ra xikepe ku ya eka tiva:**  The passage mentions a boat trip, but it's the *view* of Tonle Sap from Phnom Krom that's emphasized, not the boat trip itself.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi lavekaka eka vaendzi ku nghena ePhnom Krom?","The correct answer is **A: Ku khandziya ku hundza etempeleni ya Yasovarman**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Tempele leyi yale henhla ka xintshabyana yi akiwe eku heleni ka lembe xidzana ra vu 19, hi nkarhi wa ku fuma kahosi Yasovarman."" This means the temple is the Yasovarman temple.
* The passage also says: ""Atimosifiye leyi baseke ya tempele na ku vona tiva ya Tonle Sap yi endle u nga tisoli hi ku khandziya ntshava."" This implies the view from the temple is worth seeing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku rhendzeleka Siem Reap:** While Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, the passage doesn't mention this as a reason people go there.
* **C: Ku fika eAngkor Pass:**  The passage mentions needing a passport to visit Tonle Sap, not Angkor Pass.
* **D: Ku fambafamba hi xikepe eTonle Sap:**  The passage mentions a boat trip *to* the lake, but it doesn't say that boat trips are the main reason people visit Phnom Krom.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi sivelaka vavalangi ku endzela Antarctica?","The correct answer is **C: Xikejulu xa ntirho lexi pfumelaka ku famba hi N’wendzamhala na Sunguri.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Antarctica's remoteness and harsh conditions (extreme cold, difficult travel) have made exploration challenging. It then mentions that significant expeditions occurred in the 20th century, driven by the opportunity for scientific research and the ambition to reach the South Pole.  The passage emphasizes the difficulty of access.

Option C directly reflects the historical context of Antarctic exploration. The ""race"" to reach the South Pole (fueled by the advent of air travel and the development of airplanes) was a major impetus for expeditions during the 20th century.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mali yo tala swinene yo famba:** While funding is always necessary for expeditions, the passage doesn't highlight ""initial wealth"" as the primary driver. It focuses on the scientific and exploratory motivations.
* **B: Ku navela ntsena ku valanga Lwandle ra Ross:**  The passage mentions exploring around Ross Sea, but it doesn't say this was a *new* development that spurred expeditions. Exploration happened over time.
* **D: Ku hunguta ku fambafamba:** The passage emphasizes the difficulty of travel, not a simple desire to travel.  It describes a challenging and scientifically driven exploration.

Muvalangi loyi a tsakelaka ku khandziya tintshava a nga endzela ndhawu yihi ya Antartica?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndhawu ya le Ndzeni ka Tiko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mapfhumba yo hlawuleka ya le moyeni ya minkarhi yo karhi ya endliwa endzeni ka tiko, ka vakhandziyi va tintshava kumbe ku fikelela Pole, laha ku nga ni ndhawu leyikulu yo gova eka yona."" This translates to ""Significant atmospheric samples are collected within the continent, by researchers or by reaching the Pole, which may have a large point of convergence.""

Option B, ""Ndhawu ya le Ndzeni ka Tiko"" (The Interior Continent), directly aligns with the passage's description of where atmospheric samples are collected. The other options are coastal regions, not the interior.
"
Xana ndhawu ya languta swa le xibakabakeni ya xikhale yi nga ha tshuka yi va kwihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Endhawini leyi fikelekaka hi ku olova (Accessible by road)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ti tolovele kuva eka madoroba kumbe tikhempasi, leti kumekaka hi ku olova ku nga leti akiweke eka manguva lama.""  This translates to ""they became located in cities or camps, accessible by road."" 

Therefore, the buildings were moved to places accessible by road.
"
Xana thelesikopu ya vulavisisi ya manguva lawa yi nga tshuka yi kumeka kwihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Emuziyamu (Museum)**.

The text explicitly states: ""naswona ti lo sala tanihi timuziyamu, kumbe tindhawu ta ku dyondzisa"" which translates to ""and they remain as museums, or research places.""  Therefore, the telescopes are found in museums.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga vaka yinene ku va na siku ro rhula eribuweni?","The answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Mikarhi yin’wana ti va-mabuwu lama taleriwaka hi mindyangu laha ku nga ni nxaxamelo lowunene wa switolo leswi xaxameleke ni ribuwu"" which translates to ""Other beaches are known for having a more intense mix of fish and surf.""

Then it says ""Waitemata Harbour"" is where Tamaki Drive is located, and that Tamaki Drive is in the ""tindlwini leto durha ta Mission Bay na St Heliers"" which means ""the southern parts of Mission Bay and St Heliers.""

Therefore, Mission Bay is directly associated with the type of beach that's good for a relaxing day at the beach (more calm, less intense surf). The other options either don't have that description or are broader locations (North Harbour District, Waitemata Harbour).
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi kwihi laha swiyimo swo hlambela swi nga sirhelelekaka kona?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

The passage states: ""Mabuwu ya le North Shore ma kumeka eLwandle ra Pacific naswona ma andlaleke ku suka eLong Bay en’walungwini ku ya eDevonport edzongeni.""  This translates to: ""The bays of the North Shore extend into the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay up the coast to Devonport.""  Therefore, Devonport is mentioned as a location where the bays extend.
"
"Loko u endzela ndhawu leyi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga langutiwaka xi nga faneleki?","The correct answer is **A: Ku languteka hi ndlela ya ximfumo (To analyze in a factual way)**.

Here's why:

The question asks how to approach a desecrated site of immense historical tragedy (like a concentration camp). The passage emphasizes respect, reverence, and avoiding trivialization.  The best way to engage with such a place is through **factual analysis**. This means:

*   **Learning:** Understanding the history, the victims, and the events that transpired.
*   **Reflection:** Contemplating the human cost and the significance of the site.
*   **Remembering:** Honoring the memory of those who suffered.

The other options are inappropriate and disrespectful:

*   **B: Ku tsalatsala exivandleni lexi (To take pictures in the area):** While photography *can* be part of remembrance, it shouldn't be the primary focus, especially if done disrespectfully. The focus should be on understanding the site.
*   **C: Ku endla mafenya (To make a spectacle):** This implies a sensationalized or exploitative approach, which is completely unacceptable.
*   **D: Ku hala muako (To collect souvenirs):**  This is deeply disrespectful and trivializes the suffering of the victims.  Collecting anything from a concentration camp is considered a grave offense.



Therefore, analyzing the site in a factual and respectful manner is the most appropriate response."
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini leswi hlamuselaka tindzimi to pfuneta?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti lo tumbuluxiwa**.

Here's why:

The question states that pidgins are created when people who don't share a common language need to communicate.  This implies a deliberate simplification and mixing of languages.  That's the definition of a pidgin: **created** or **constructed** by speakers of different languages for communication.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ti lo endliwa hi munhu (It is done by humans):** While true, it doesn't capture the essence of *how* pidgins are formed.  It's a consequence, not the defining characteristic.
* **B: A hi ta ntumbuluko (It is a mistake/error):**  Pidgins aren't mistakes; they are a practical solution to a communication problem.
* **D: Ta cincacinca (It is changed/modified):**  While languages evolve, pidgins are *created* as simplified communication tools, not modified from existing languages.



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi ti hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma tindzimi to pfuneta?,"The correct answer is **A: I tindzimi to cincacinca leti endliweke leswaku vanhu lava swi va tikelaka ku twisisana va vulavurisana.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what is revealed by the study of creole languages.** The provided text states that creole languages arise when people who are not able to understand each other need to communicate.  Therefore, the key characteristic revealed is that creoles are *newly formed languages arising from the need for communication between groups who don't share a common language.*

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I tindzimi ta ntumbuluko ni leti tumbuluxiweke (Pidgin and Inflectional Languages):** While creoles can sometimes evolve *from* pidgins, the defining characteristic of creoles is their development *into* fully-fledged languages used by native speakers, not just as a temporary means of communication.  The text doesn't highlight this aspect.
* **C: I tindzimi leti endleriweke ku antswisa swiyimo leswi tikaka swa mbulavurisano (Languages formed to serve the needs of interaction):** This is a very broad statement and, while partially true, it doesn't capture the specific context of creoles described in the text – the emergence *from* a lack of shared language.
* **D: I tindzimi leti tirhaka swinene eka lava vulavulaka tindzimi tin’wana (Languages used fluently by speakers of other languages):** Creoles are *used* by speakers of other languages, but the crucial point is that they *emerge* from the need for communication between speakers of *different* languages, often without proficiency in each other's.



Therefore, option A best reflects the core information presented in the text about creole languages.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi mukhandziyi a faneleke ku xi kamba loko xikepe xakwe hi xixika?","The correct answer is **B: Swilaveko swa visa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Loko u hundza hi le Northern Baltic hi xixika, kumisisa leswaku kamara ra wena exikepeni ri le kwihi, hikuva ku famba eayisini swi vanga pongo swinene leri nga tingaka lava tsandzekaka ku ri tiyiselela."" This translates to: ""When you are in the Northern Baltic sea, announce where your cabin is, as sailing can be very rough and may not allow you to find your way back.""

Therefore, the most appropriate action is to **announce your cabin number** to help find your way back to your cabin if the sea gets rough.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndhawu ya xikepe (Ship's door):** Announcing your cabin number isn't related to the ship's door.
* **C: Swinawana (Souvenirs):**  Souvenirs are irrelevant to the situation.
* **D: Nkarhi wo wu tshama edorobeni (Time to go to the city):** The passage doesn't mention going to the city. It focuses on safety at sea.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xikepe xa mukhandziyi hi ximumu, i yini lexi va nga kotaka ku xi papalata?","The correct answer is **B: Ku famba eayisini**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the passengers might complain about based on the provided text. The text explicitly states: ""Ku famba eayisini swi vanga pongo swinene leri nga tingaka lava tsandzekaka ku ri tiyiselela."" This translates to ""Traveling by bus can be very difficult and may not be comfortable.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nkarhi wo wu heta edorobeni (The time it takes to get to the city):** While time might be a factor, the text doesn't directly mention it as a complaint.
* **C: Swilaveko swa visa (Visa procedures):** The text mentions visa regulations, but it doesn't indicate that visa procedures are a problem *during* the journey.
* **D: Saint Petersburg:** Saint Petersburg is simply the location where the ship docks; it's not directly related to a potential passenger complaint about the journey itself.



"
Hikwalaho ka yini Xicatalan xi hambeta xi tirhiseriwa swifaniso ni switiviso eBarcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: A ku ri ririmi ro sungula ra ximfumo edorobeni (It is the original language of the city).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Hambiswiritano, ti sayini to tala ti kombisiwe hi Xicatalan hikuva swi simekiwe hi nawu leswaku hi rona ririmi ro sungula ra le nawini."" (In addition, the most prominent signs are shown in Catalan because it is the original language of the city.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xi twisisiwa swinene ku tlula Xipaniya (It is widely understood throughout Spain):** While many understand it, the text also mentions Spanish is widely used. This isn't the primary reason for its use in Barcelona.
* **C: I ririmi leri tsakeriwaka le Barcelona (It is the most spoken language in Barcelona):** The text doesn't state that Catalan is the most spoken language. It only says it's the original language.
* **D: Metro ni swivandla swin’wana swo tirhisiwa hi rixaka swi endzeriwa ngopfu hi vaakatiko lava vulaka Xicatalan (The Metro and other things are mostly done in various languages by people who speak Catalan):** While people who speak Catalan are involved, the *reason* for using Catalan in the Metro isn't that they speak it; it's because it's the original language of the city.



"
Eka tindzimi leti landzelaka hi rihi leri tirhisiwaka hi Metro ya le Barcelona eka switiviso swa ntolovelo?,"The correct answer is **C: Xipaniya**.

The text states: ""Switiviso eka ti Metro swi endliwa hi Catalan, kambe swikavanyeto swa xitshuketa swi tivisiwa hi tindximi to hambana hambana leti kiatsaka Xipaniya...""  This translates to: ""The announcements on the Metro are made in Catalan, but the advertisements are placed by various companies that use Spanish...""

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka switirhisiwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga taka xi nga tsakeriwi ngopfu hi ndhawu ya byetlelo ni xifihlulo ya xiyimo xa le henhla?","The correct answer is **A: Swilo swa menyu yo hlawuleka (Delicious menu items)**.

Here's why:

The text highlights two main competitive factors for B&Bs: breakfast and hidden meals (food prepared with local ingredients and traditional methods). The text explicitly states that B&Bs compete on these two.

While the other options (old, comfortable furniture, well-maintained grounds, and reliable WiFi) are *nice* to have, they are not directly linked to the *competitive* factors of breakfast and the special, hidden meals described in the text.  The text emphasizes the *food* as a key differentiator.

Therefore, ""Delicious menu items"" directly addresses the competitive aspect of breakfast and the special meals prepared with local ingredients, making it the most relevant answer.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki yin’wana ya timhakakulu ta mphikizano exikarhi ka ti-B&B ta manyunyu?","The best answer is **D: Swakudya ni swakunwa leswi kumekaka endhawini yoleyo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Hi ntolovelo ti B&B to durha swinene ti phikizana hi swilo swimbirhi leswikulu: swo funengela ha swona ni swakudya swo fihlula.""  This directly links food and drink to the main competition between B&Bs.
* **The passage details both aspects of food:**  It mentions the availability of local ingredients, the preparation of traditional dishes, and the overall dining experience within the B&B.
* **While other options are mentioned, they are secondary to the food competition.**  The passage describes the *nature* of the competition, highlighting the food and drink as the central point of differentiation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ku sasekisa ka ntolovelo (Online Booking):**  While online booking is important for any business, the passage doesn't emphasize it as a major point of competition *between* the B&Bs.
* **B: Swiphameriwa swa xifihlulo hikuya hi nguva (Hidden Fees/Time-sensitive Offers):** The passage doesn't mention hidden fees or time-sensitive offers as part of the main competition.
* **C: Swo funengela swa manyunyu (Local Authenticity/Genuine Experience):**  While the passage touches upon local authenticity, it's specifically tied to the *food and dining experience*, making option D a more encompassing and accurate answer.



Therefore, the competition centered around **food and drink specific to the local area** is the key focus of the passage.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga taka xi nga khomeriwi eBeijing hi 2022?","The correct answer is **A: Nkhuvo wo sungula mitlangu**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Beijing yi ta khoma nkhuvo wo sungula ni wo gimeta mintlangu yoleyo swin’we ni mintlangu ya le ayisini leyi khomeriwaka endzeni."" This translates to: ""Beijing will reclaim the opening ceremony and will also host the entire remaining ceremonies and the ceremonies of the ice and snow sports that were held within.""

Option A directly reflects this statement about Beijing reclaiming the opening ceremony. While options B and C are mentioned, they are consequences of the opening ceremony, not what Beijing itself will reclaim. Option D is irrelevant as the passage focuses on the 2022 Olympics.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga ta khomeriwa eBeijing hi 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Mitlangu ya le ayisini endzeni ka miako**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Beijing yi ta khoma nkhuvo wo sungula ni wo gimeta mintlangu yoleyo swin’we ni mintlangu ya le ayisini leyi khomeriwaka endzeni."" This translates to ""Beijing will reclaim the opening ceremony and reclaim all the flowers and the flowers that have been grown inside.""  The ""flowers"" here refer to the **ice and snow (winter) events** that were held.
"
I mani loyi a nga le khombyeni lerikulu to ngheniwa hi mukhuhlwana wa swinyenyani,"The correct answer is **C: Vanhu lava tirhaka hi tihuku (People who work with poultry)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Swo tala a swi katsa vanhu lava tirhaka hi tihuku..."" which translates to ""Initially, it affected people who work with poultry..."".  The question asks who is most at risk. Therefore, the people who work with poultry are the group initially affected and thus at a higher risk.



Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Vavalangi va swinyenyani (Poultry farmers)** - Poultry farmers are *a type* of people who work with poultry.  While at risk, the text specifically mentions *anyone* working with poultry.
*   **B: Vanhu lava tirhaka hi swiharhi leswi mamisaka (People who work with meat products)** - While there's a potential risk, the text focuses on the initial spread related to poultry.
*   **D: Vanhu lava a wu va khomile eku sunguleni (People who have not been exposed initially)** - This is the opposite of the question, which asks who *could* be affected.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzeleka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka kahle mukhuhlwana wa swinyenyani?","The correct answer is **A: Lava tirhaka hi tihuku hi vona ntsena lava ngheniweke hi mukhuhlwana lowu.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Swo tala a swi katsa vanhu lava tirhaka hi tihuku..."" which translates to ""Initially, it affected people who work with poultry..."" This directly links poultry workers to the initial cases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku ni nhlayo yo tala ya vanhu lava wu va ngheneke ku tlula swinyenyani** (There is an initial concern about people who have been in contact with poultry): While concern exists, the passage doesn't state there's an *initial* concern. It states the initial cases were *among* poultry workers.
* **C: Vavalangi va swinyenyani va le khombyeni ro ngheniwa hi mukhuhlwana lowu** (Poultry farmers are in the group infected by the avian influenza): The passage mentions poultry workers, not necessarily farmers.
* **D: Tinhlayo hinkwato leti vikiweke eka vanhu ti ve leti dlayaka** (The medical treatments given to people have been ineffective): The passage says some people have died despite treatment, but it doesn't say the treatments are ineffective overall.



"
Xana Lwandle Ro Basa–Baltic Canal ri hlanganisa yini?,"The correct answer is **C: Lwandle ra Arctic na Lwandle ra Baltic**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Lwandle Ro Basa–Balanti Canal yi hlanganisa Arctic Ocean na Lwandle Ra Baltic..."" (The Basso-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lwandle ra Ntima na Lwandle ra Caspian:**  The canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, not the Arctic and Caspian Seas. The passage mentions the Caspian Sea in relation to the Volga river, but not the connection to the canal.
* **B: Tiva ra Onega na Nambu wa Volga:** While the Onega River connects to the Volga, the canal connects larger bodies of water: the Arctic and Baltic Seas.
* **D: Lwandle ra le Dzongeni na Lwandle ro Tshwuka:** This option doesn't appear anywhere in the provided text and is not related to the Basso-Baltic Canal.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndlela yo teka tipasi handle ko kavanyeta mukhandziyi?","The correct answer is **B: Switimela leswi nga ni byetlelo (Loose cargo)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Eka switimela leswi u nga tlelaka eka swona, mufambisi a nga ha teka tipasi leswaku mi nga kavanyetiwi loko mi etlele.""  This translates to: ""On cargo that you might not be able to secure, the carrier may take out insurance because it may not be recoverable if it is lost.""

Loose cargo (switimela leswi nga ni byetlelo) is the type of cargo that is most likely to be lost or damaged if not properly secured, thus requiring insurance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Swihahampfhuka (Vehicles):** While vehicles can carry cargo, the text doesn't specifically relate insurance to vehicles.
*   **C: Swikepe (Ships):** Similar to vehicles, ships are modes of transport and not directly tied to the need for insurance on cargo.
*   **D: Switimela leswi tsemakanyaka mindzilakano (Cargo with fixed dimensions):** Cargo with fixed dimensions is easier to secure and less likely to be lost, so insurance is less likely to be required.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana ID ya wena yi nga ha kamberiwa rini eka switimela swin’wana leswi tsemakanyaka mindzilakano?","The correct answer is **A: Endzhaku ko xika exitimeleni (At the exit of the vehicle)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eka switimela leswi u nga tlelaka eka swona, mufambisi a nga ha teka tipasi leswaku mi nga kavanyetiwi loko mi etlele."" (On vehicles you cannot stay, the driver might take tickets if you don't pay when you get off.)

This implies that payment (and therefore potential ID check) happens *when you leave* the vehicle, at the exit.  Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko u etlele (When you get off):** This is close, but ""endzhaku ko xika exitimeleni"" is more precise - it specifies the *location* where the ticket might be checked.
* **C: A swi kamberiwi (They are not paid):** The passage implies payment *is* expected.
* **D: Exitimeleni lexi fambaka (Moving vehicles):** While the context is vehicles, this doesn't address *when* payment happens.



"
Eka swilo leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi ngopfungopfu xi nga tshukaka xi endleka loko u ri endhawini ya tithiropikhi le Singapore?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku karhatiwa hi ku hisa ka dyambu**.

Here's why:

The question mentions ""tithiropikhi leti tlakukeke"" (compressed tropics) and specifically asks about the most frequent occurrences in Singapore. The text states that Singapore is often hit by ""tithiropikhi leti tlakukeke"" and that the most common effects are ""ku hisa (minkarhi hinkwayo) na dyambu (loko xibakabaka xi nga ri na mapapa, a swi tolovelekangi)"" which translates to ""rains (frequently) and floods (which can be without papers, not predictable)"". 

Therefore, the most frequent occurrence related to the compressed tropics in Singapore is floods caused by heavy rains.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ku tekeriwa swilo (Things are being collected):** While possible after a flood, it's not the *most* frequent occurrence.
* **B: Ku pfumala switolo (Fruits are ripening):**  This is related to the tropical climate in general, but not directly linked to the specific phenomenon of ""tithiropikhi leti tlakukeke"" and its consequences in Singapore.
* **D: Ku lahleka (Things are being lost):**  Possible after a flood, but not the primary or most frequent event.



"
I mani loyi a nga tshukaka a lava ku papalata ku dya makhekhe ya le German?,"The best answer is **D: Munhu loyi a rhandzaka swilo swo tsokombela kumbe tlula swo xawula (Someone who likes sweet or rich things).**

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the sweet nature of German pastries.** It mentions fruit fillings (apples, plums), sweet toppings, and the general deliciousness.
* **The question asks who would enjoy German pastries.**
* **Option D encompasses the core appeal:** German pastries are known for being sweet, rich, and often decadent.  Someone who enjoys those flavors would likely be drawn to them.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Munhu loyi miri wakwe wu nga ni rinyenyo ra timanga (Someone whose blood has a nutty essence):** This is a metaphorical and unusual interpretation of the text. It's not the primary reason people enjoy the pastries.
* **B: Munhu loyi a rhandzaka tidizete to tsokombela (Someone who likes crispy, fried things):** While some German pastries are fried, the text focuses more on the sweet fillings and toppings. Crispy isn't the defining characteristic.
* **C: Munhu loyi a nyenyaka chokoleti (Someone who loves chocolate):** While some German pastries might contain chocolate, it's not the central theme of the text, and many are fruit-based.



"
Hi xihi xilo lexi langutiwaka hi fambisana ni nguva eka makhekhe ya le German?,"The correct answer is **A: Maapula (Apples)**.

The text states: ""Makhekhe lama cheriweke mihandzu ma tolovelekilele ma va ma cheriwe maapula lama swekiweke..."" which translates to ""The cakes that have been baked for centuries are baked with stewed apples...""

Therefore, apples are mentioned in connection with the history of German cakes.
"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xibumabumelo xo famba hi ku pima matirhelo ya mali?","The correct answer is **A: Ku kuma swintirhwana hi nkarhi wo riendzo (Getting a side hustle in time)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes people resorting to desperate measures to get money, like stealing or manipulating others.  The question asks what happens when people *don't* have a way to earn money legitimately. The passage implies that the inability to find a legitimate income source leads to these harmful behaviors.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ku cincacinca ntshamiseko wa wena (Changing your lifestyle):**  While adjusting expenses is important, the passage emphasizes the *lack of income* as the root cause of the problems, not simply a lifestyle choice.
* **C: Ku kombela mali eka vanhu (Asking people for money):**  The passage hints at this as a desperate act, but it doesn't frame it as a primary solution for people who are consistently unable to earn.
* **D: Ku hunguta leswi xaviwaka tanihi swakudya ni byetlelo (Selling unwanted food and clothes):** This is a legitimate way to earn money and the opposite of what the passage describes as people resorting to.


Therefore, the passage suggests that finding a way to earn money (a side hustle) *in a timely manner* is crucial to avoid the negative actions it describes.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi swi nga n’wi tikelaka ku famba hi ndlela yo pima swinene matirhelo ya mali?","The correct answer is **C: Munhu loyi a hlelaka ku tirhela ekule loko a ri eriendzweni (Someone who plans ahead while doing things)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of budgeting and planning to avoid financial difficulties. It highlights that people often overspend, don't stick to budgets, and resort to borrowing or begging when they run out of money. Option C directly reflects the advice given in the text – to plan ahead and manage finances effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Munhu loyi a amukelaka ntlhontlho (Someone who accepts losses):** While accepting losses can be part of financial management, it's not the primary solution to prevent financial problems. The passage focuses on preventing losses in the first place.
*   **B: Munhu loyi a tsandzekaka ku titsona swilo (Someone who enjoys buying things):** This describes someone who is prone to overspending, which the passage cautions against.
*   **D: Munhu loyi a tsakelaka ku landzelaka leswi tsariweke ehansi (Someone who is stubborn about following established things):** While sticking to a budget requires discipline, the passage isn't about stubbornness. It's about planning and managing finances wisely.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kambe lexi hlamarisaka, kambe, i leswaku network ya foni yi khoma swinene ku tlula emagondzweni yo tala, hi xikombiso, ku tlula gondzo ra Pennsylwania Wilds."" This translates to ""But what hinders, however, is that the phone network is very poor beyond the initial roads, notably beyond the Pennsylwania Wilds.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku ni mpfhuka wo leha exikarhi ka madoroba ya le kule (There is heavy traffic in the middle of the towns)** - The passage doesn't mention traffic.
* **B: Tindlela ti larile (The roads are narrow)** - The passage doesn't mention road width.
* **C: Mpimo wa rivilo a wu landzeriwi (The speed limit is not observed)** - The passage states that the speed limit is 35-40 mph and that drivers *should* obey it. It doesn't say it's not observed.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi hi xihi lexi faneleke ku vilerisa vachayeri lava fambaka egondzweni ra Buffalo-Pittsburg","The correct answer is **B: Ku pfumala ka vukorhokeri lebyinene bya foni (Severe cell service disruption)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kambe lexi hlamarisaka, kambe, i leswaku network ya foni yi khoma swinene ku tlula emagondzweni yo tala, hi xikombiso, ku tlula gondzo ra Pennsylwania Wilds."" This translates to: ""But what complicates things, however, is that cell phone service is severely disrupted beyond the initial stretches, especially past the Pennsylvania Wilds.""

The other options are not directly mentioned or supported by the text:

*   **A: Ku hlwerisiwa hi ntlimbano wa mimovha (Engine failure):** The passage doesn't mention engine failure.
*   **C: Ku jika swinene hi rivilo (Severe visibility with headlights):** While the passage mentions visibility, it's not highlighted as a major concern.
*   **D: Ku hlangana ni ku akiwa ka patu nkarhi ni nkarhi (Frequent encounters and merging with trucks):** The passage doesn't mention truck encounters.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga lavekiki eka ntlangu wa canyoneering?,"The correct answer is **C: Vuswikoti byo tlula**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about dangers in canyoning.** The text describes canyoning as descending canyons using water and/or dry canyons, requiring scrambling, climbing, and rappelling.
* **""Vuswikoti byo tlula"" translates to ""Falling hazards"" or ""Slipping hazards.""** This directly relates to the dangers of descending steep, often wet and slippery, canyon walls.
* **Let's look at why the other options are less likely:**
    * **A: Vuswokoti byo hlambela (Drowning hazards):** While drowning *can* be a hazard in canyoning, it's not as universally inherent as falling hazards.
    * **B: Xiyimo xa miri lexinene (Large rocks):**  Large rocks are a potential hazard, but not the primary or defining danger mentioned in the description of canyoning itself.
    * **D: Ku tiletela loku nga nyawuriki (Getting stuck):** Getting stuck is a possibility, but falling and slipping are more fundamental and consistently present dangers in canyoning.



Therefore, **falling hazards (Vuswikoti byo tlula)** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the description of canyoning provided.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga lavekaka eka pfhumba ra canyoneering?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku va ni xitifiketi xa canyoneering**.

Here's why:

* **Canyoning is a potentially dangerous activity.** It involves descending canyons using a variety of techniques and requires specific skills and knowledge.
* **Safety is paramount.**  Having a canyoning certificate demonstrates that a person has been trained in safe canyoning practices, including rope work, rappelling, swimming, and rescue techniques.
* **The question asks about safety precautions.** A certificate directly addresses this.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Vuswokoti lebyikulu bya matsambu (Large ropes):** While ropes are used in canyoning, simply having large ropes doesn't guarantee safety.  Proper rope handling and technique are crucial.
* **B: Ntokoto wa scuba diving (Scuba diving equipment):**  Scuba diving equipment is not typically used in canyoning. Canyoning often involves navigating through shallow water and using ropes and other specialized gear.
* **D: Vuswikoti byo hlambela (Swimming gear):**  Swimming gear is necessary, but again, it's not a comprehensive safety requirement.  Proper swimming ability *and* canyoning-specific skills are essential.



Therefore, a canyoning certificate is the most important safety precaution listed."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga pfunaka eka loyi a hlelaka ku dzima tendze a ri emovheni wakwe?","The correct answer is **A: Ku twisisa swinene ku tsana ka movha wa wena**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that using your own vehicle is the best way to avoid theft because it's the most secure. It also mentions that parking in certain areas increases the risk of theft. Therefore, the main point is understanding and taking precautions regarding your own vehicle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Movha laha u kotaka ku etlerisa switshamo:** This is irrelevant to the topic of vehicle theft.
* **C: Tende:**  A tent has nothing to do with vehicle security.
* **D: Ndhawu ya munhu yo kota ku dzima tende:** While people might steal from any location, the text isn't focusing on *where* someone steals from, but *why* someone who parks in a specific location is at risk.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, lava dzimaka matende emimovheni va fanele ku papalata yini loko va lava ku laha ku nga riki na swikavanyeto?","The correct answer is **A: Ku famba hi movha lowukulu, wo fana na SUV kumbe vheni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku etlela emovheni swa koteka loko u ri ni movha lowukulu wo tanihi vheni, SUV, Sedan kumbe Station Wagon lowu nga ni switulu leswi etlerisiwaka.""  This translates to: ""It is safer to travel in a larger vehicle, such as an SUV, Sedan, or Station Wagon with seatbelts.""

Therefore, to avoid being targeted by thieves, it's recommended to use a larger vehicle.  The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a pfuxeteke Casablanca ra vumbirhi?","The correct answer is **B: Vaxavisi va le Spaniya**.

The passage states: ""Maputukezi va ri hlaserile va tlhela va aka hi vuntswa ehansi ka Casa Branca, va tlhela va ri tshika endzhaku ko tseka tseka ka misava hi 1755. Sultan yale Morocco yi tlhele yi aka doroba tanihi Daru I-Badya naswona yi nyikiwe vito ra Casablanca hi va xavisi vale Spaniya lava sunguleke ndhawu yo xavisa eka yona kwalani.""

This translates to: ""The Portuguese landed and established themselves at Casa Branca, and later built fortifications around it until 1755. The Sultan of Morocco then moved the city to Dar I-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by the Portuguese who established a trading post there.""

Therefore, the Portuguese were the ones who gave Casablanca its name.
"
I vamani lava siyeke doroba ra manguva lawa ra Casablanca endzhaku ka mhangu ya ntumbuluko?,"The correct answer is **B: Maputukezi**.

The text states: ""Maputukezi va ri hlaserile va tlhela va aka hi vuntswa ehansi ka Casa Branca..."" (The Portuguese settled and established themselves under Casa Branca...). This indicates that the Portuguese were the ones who left the city after the earthquake.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Varhoma (Phoenicians):** They were the founders of the city, but the text doesn't say they left after the earthquake.
*   **Va le Spaniya (Spaniards):** They were involved in the city's history (giving it its current name), but the text doesn't mention them leaving after the earthquake.
*   **Vaphoenicia (Phoenicians):** Same as Varhoma, they were the founders and not mentioned as leaving after the earthquake.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana Sintra ri lemukiwe ximfumo hi ndlela yihi exikarhi ka vanhu va matiko mambe?","The correct answer is **B: Laha Mariya a humelelaka kona**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the legend of Sintra became famous due to the place where Mary is said to have appeared (Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima).  The passage connects this legend to Lord Byron's writings and the growing interest in Sintra.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabo da Roca:** While Cabo da Roca is mentioned as a place visited, the passage doesn't suggest it was the *reason* for Sintra's fame.
* **C: Swibumabumelo leswinene swa Lord Byron:** Lord Byron's writings *contributed* to the fame, but they weren't the initial spark of the legend.  The legend existed beforehand.
* **D: Matimu ya rona yo rhandzeka:** This refers to the beauty of the town. While beauty contributed, the passage focuses on the *legend* as the primary driver of fame.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is that Sintra gained fame *because of the place where Mary is said to have appeared.*



"
I yini lexi nga amukeriwiki hi Armenia?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndhawu ya Nagorno-Karabakh**.

The question states that the conflict started over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is claimed by both Armenia and Azerbaijan. The other options are related to the conflict, but not the *cause* of the conflict itself.
"
I yini lexi hambetaka xi kavanyeta vuxaka exikarhi ka Azerbaijan na Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndhawu ya Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the conflict began over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is a disputed territory. The rest of the passage discusses the impact of this conflict and attempts to resolve it diplomatically. The other options are consequences or related events, but not the *cause* of the conflict itself.
"
"Loko u tirhisa thekisi eCharlotte, i yini lexi nga vangelaka hakelo leyi engetelekeke?","The correct answer is **C: Ku ya eUptown**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Eka malembe ya 20 lama hundzeke, nhlayo ya tindhawu leti tsakisaka-vana ti engetelane ngopfu swinene eUptown Charlotte. Mathekisi a ya tali ku tirhisiwa hi mindyangu eCharlotte, kambe i ya nkoka eka swiyimo swin’wana."" This means the cost of ride-sharing is higher in Uptown Charlotte.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tekiwaka xi nga ri xinene hi ku tshama ni vana eCharlotte?","The correct answer is **B: Ku famba hi thekisi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mathekisi a ya tali ku tirhisiwa hi mindyangu eCharlotte, kambe i ya nkoka eka swiyimo swin’wana. Ku na ntsengo lowu engetelekeke loko vanhu va famba va ri 2, hikwalaho fambelo leri ri nga dura ku swi nga fanelangi.""  This directly translates to ""Taxis are not easily available for people in Charlotte, but it is necessary for other means of transport. There is an increased cost when people travel in pairs, because the fare can be expensive and not affordable.""

This indicates that **finding taxis (Ku famba hi thekisi)** is a challenge and can be expensive in Charlotte, especially when traveling with children.  The other options aren't directly mentioned as challenges in the text.
"
"Loko va le Spaniya va nga si fika, i mani loyi a a lawula xiphemu xa le n’walungwini xa Chile?","The correct answer is **D: Mainca**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""n’walungu wa Chile a wu fumiwa hi mfumo wa Inca naswona Maarucania (Mapuche)..."" This indicates that the Mapuche (also known as Araucanians) were a significant power in Chile before the Spanish arrived and controlled a large portion of the territory.  While the Inca also had influence, the text specifically highlights the Mapuche's role in controlling Chile *before* the Spanish.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapuche** - While the Mapuche were powerful, the question asks *who* controlled the territory *before* the Spanish. The passage mentions them as co-controllers *with* the Inca.
*   **B: Maamerika** - This is too broad. The question asks for a specific group.
*   **C: Maaraucania** - Maaraucania is a region/historical period associated with the Mapuche people, not a controlling power in the entire territory.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga endlekangiki hi 1810?","The correct answer is **B: Chile ri hlule Spain**.

Here's why:

The text states that Chile gained independence in 1810 due to the Napoleonic Wars distracting Spain.  The text also mentions Chile was ""ntshunxeko"" (resistant/rebellious) to the Spanish, meaning they were not easily controlled.  Therefore, the most direct consequence of Spain being distracted by Napoleon's wars and Chile's resistance would be Chile declaring independence (or at least attempting to).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: A ku pfumaleka hulumendhe ya le xikarhi (A government of the time emerged):** While likely true, the text doesn't directly state this. Independence is the more significant and direct consequence.
* **C: A ku lwiwa tinyimpi ta Napoleon (The Napoleonic Wars were fought):**  The text mentions the wars as a distraction, but it's not the *result* of what happened in 1810. It's the *cause* of Chile's move towards independence.
* **D: Chile ri tivise ntshunxeko (Chile caused resistance):** This is a restatement of something already mentioned in the text, not a consequence of the event in 1810.



"
Xana vanhu va nga fikelela miti ya le kule endhawini ya Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Hi xitimela kumbe xikepe**.

The text states: ""Tindlela, switimela na mabyatso swi hlanganisa matiko xikaya lama, naswona timovha a ti koti ku fikelela ku suka etindhawini tin’wana.""  This translates to: ""Roads, trains, and boats connect the villages, and cars are trying to reach from other places.""  Therefore, you can reach Cinque Terre by train or by boat.
"
Xana marito ya Xintariyana lama nge ‘Cinque Terre’ ma vula yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindhawu ta ntlhanu (Five villages)**.

The first paragraph states: ""Cinque Terre, leswi vulaka Tindhawu Ta Ntlhanu..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which consists of Five Villages...""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i tibutsu ta muxaka wihi lexi lulameleke vuxaka lebyi nga vangelaka ku rheta?","The correct answer is **A: Tibutsu leti nga ni swirhendze swo lala** (Parts with a sleeping/resting ridge).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ti khavisiwe hi nsimbi naswona ku ni nsimbi leyi engeteleriweke leswaku ti nga rheti eka tindhawu leti rhetisaka, leti faneleke tintanghu to tala ni tibutsu, ti endleriwe xirhendze kumbe xirhendze na solo.""  This translates to: ""They are covered with paint and also with a non-slip surface so that they do not rust in the areas that rust, which should be the initial parts and parts, made of galvanized iron or iron and solo.""

This indicates that parts with a *resting ridge* (swirhendze swo lala) are specifically designed to prevent rusting.  The other options are less accurate:

* **B: Tibutsu leti nga tisolo** (Parts with a solo): While solo is mentioned as a material, the resting ridge is the key feature preventing rust.
* **C: Tibutsu leti nga ni swirhendze swo leha** (Parts with a leaning ridge): The text doesn't mention a leaning ridge.
* **D: Tibutsu to pfumala phateni yo enta 1/5 inch** (Parts that have a pattern that is 1/5 inch): The text specifies the *resting ridge* as important, not just the overall pattern size.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga taka xi nga pfuni emapatwini ya ayisi hi xixika?,"The answer is **A: Munyu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sava, giravhele kumbe munyu (khalisiyamu tlilorayidi) swi tala ku hangalasiwa emapatwini leswaku ku antwisiwa ku khomelela."" This translates to: ""Sand, gravel, or concrete are placed first at the base to prevent cracking.""  Therefore, the substance that's placed *first* to prevent cracking is sand.

The question asks what *causes* cracking in asphalt. The passage directly says that sand is used to *prevent* cracking.  This means if sand isn't used, something else might cause cracking. The passage lists sand, gravel, and concrete as things placed at the base. Of the options, only **munyu (concrete)** is listed, and it is suggested that concrete is placed at the base to prevent cracking.

Therefore, **munyu** is the correct answer because it is mentioned as being used to prevent cracking, and the passage states that these materials are placed at the base.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi fanaka exikarhi ka Hawaii na Swihlala swa Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti tirhisa nkarhi wa wachi lowu fanaka**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku pfa ku ehleketiwa leswaku swihlala leswi swi le “hansi ka Hawaii”...Ha timbirhi ti ni tihotela to tala letikulu"" This tells us they both had early hotels. The passage also mentions ""Ti tirhisa nkarhi wo fana ni wa le Hawaii,"" meaning they use a similar time zone. The other options are incorrect: the passage doesn't mention any similarities in topography (B) or the presence of towns (D).



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga hlamuseriki hi ku kongoma Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **D: Tiko leri ra le xihlaleni ri tirhisa nkarhi lowu fanaka na Hawaii**.

The passage explicitly states: ""I swihlala swa Cook a xi na madoroba kambe xi vumbiwa hi swihlala swa 15 swo hambanahambana. Leswikulu swa kona i Rarotonga na Aitutaki. **Hi swileswi swi nga switsongo, swi tsundzuxa vaendzi lavakulu lava huma eHawaii nkarhi lowu a swi nga si kota ku tiyimela naswona swi nga si va ni tihotela letikulu ta vaendzi ni ku hluvuka kun’wana loku endlekeke. Xihlala xa Cook a xi na madoroba kambe xi vumbiwa hi swihlala swa 15 swo hambanahambana. Leswikulu swa kona i Rarotonga na Aitutaki.**""

This means the Cook Islands are similar to Hawaii in the sense that early settlers couldn't sustain themselves there, leading to hardship and the inability to build large hotels. The passage also points out that the islands have a similar timeline to Hawaii.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yi tsanana eka Hawaii:** While there are similarities, the question asks for *the most striking* similarity mentioned. Option D is more specific.
*   **B: I nongonoko wa swihlala:** The passage describes the islands and their population, not their political status.
*   **C: Madorobakulu i Rarotonga na Aitutaki:** This is a true statement from the passage, but it doesn't represent the *most striking* similarity.



"
Eka tindhawu ta varindzi va swiharhi leti landzelaka hi tihi lexi nga ni mixaka yimbirhi ya byetlelo?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sirena i ndhawu yin’we ntsena leyi ku tshamaka varindzi va swiharhi leyi nyikaka vanhu ndhawu yo tlela ni swakudya swo hisa ku engetela eka ku khempa.""  (Sirena is another place where rangers wander, offering people a relaxing place and delicious food to take to the campsite.)  The other options (Los Patos, La Leona, and San Pedrillo) are mentioned as campsites *without* food availability.

Therefore, Sirena is the only one described as being frequented by rangers *and* offering food.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi kwihi laha u nga kumaka mpfumelelo wa le ntangeni loko u lava ku tirhisa mali hi ku kongoma ematshan’weni ya xikweleti?","The correct answer is **C: CafeNet El Sol**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""CafeNet El Sol yi pfumelela munhu a buka hi mali yo ringana US$30, kambe $10 ya ku va kona siku rin’we; leswaku u kuma vuxokoxoko yana eka peji ra vona ra Corcovado."" This translates to ""CafeNet El Sol allowed someone to book with an amount equivalent to US$30, or $10 on another day; you can find more information on their Corcovado page.""  This directly indicates that CafeNet El Sol accepts cash payments for booking/permits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sirena:** The passage says Sirena doesn't offer food or lodging, and isn't a place where you can get a permit.
* **B: Puerto Jiménez:**  It's mentioned as a place to ask for permits, but the passage says they don't accept credit cards.
* **D: La Leona:**  La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos are camping sites that don't provide food or lodging.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka wihi wa ntlangu wa ku rheta lowu tlangiwaka eswintshabyanini?","The correct answer is **B: Ku rheta etindhawini ta le kule ni doroba**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ntlangu lowu wu tlhela wu vitaniwa ku rheta eswintshabyanini, ku valanga u ri karhi u rheta kumbe ku hayika hi ku rheta. Wa yelana ni wo rheta eka gamboko endhawini leri rhelelaka kumbe leri nga ni tintshava...""  This translates to: ""The language that is always called to be used in the city, where you can either easily use it or struggle to use it. You agree to use it in a place where there is a city or a place that has villages...""

The other options are not supported by the text:

* **A: Ku haha emoyeni** (Laughing in the air) - This is not mentioned.
* **C: Ku khandziya tintshava u tamele switirhisiwa** (Collecting shells and using them) - This refers to items used in the language, not the location where the language is spoken.
* **D: Ku rheta u ri ni bege leyi tikaka** (Speaking with a broken voice) - This is mentioned as a *difficulty* of speaking, but not the defining characteristic of where the language is spoken.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga pfunaka vavalangi lava rhetaka lava lavaka ku fikelela rivilo ra le henhla?","The correct answer is **A: Tibutsu leti tiyeke (Dried herbs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ehleketa hi tindlela to rheta eka gamboko ku fana ni loko u ehleketa hi to hayika. Loko swiyimo swi ri kahle u ta kota ku fika ekule ku tlula loko u famba kunene- kambe a swi talanga leswaku u nga ta kota ku famba hi rivilo loko u rheta u ri ni bege leyitikaka.""

This translates to: ""To succeed in hunting, you must be stealthy, just like when you hunt silently. When things go well, you can get close to the prey - but you won't be able to move swiftly if you hunt with stale herbs.""

The passage implies that **dried herbs (tibutsu leti tiyeke)** are the reason hunting might fail to get close to the prey, preventing success.  The passage suggests that fresh herbs are needed for stealth and success.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bege leyi tikaka (Stale herbs):** Stale herbs are the *problem* preventing success, not what *enables* reaching the prey.
* **C: Swiyimo leswinene (True intentions):** While important in hunting, the passage focuses on the practical element of the herbs.
* **D: Tindlela leti lulamisiweke (Well-used techniques):** Good hunting techniques are mentioned, but the passage specifically highlights the importance of the herbs in conjunction with those techniques.



"
Vafambi lava hlangahlanganaka hikwalaho ko va eka ndhavuko wun’wana va tikeriwa hi ku endla yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku lehisa mbilu ni ku twisisa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Loko u vuyela ekaya endzhaku ko tshama eka matiko ya le handle, kumbexana vanhu a va ku lehisela mbilu naswona va twisisa, a va tiva leswaku vafambi lava fikaka eka tiko lerintshwa va fanele va tolovela.""  This translates to: ""When you return home after visiting the authorities, people will show respect and understanding, realizing that travelers who have arrived at a different region should pay respects.""

While option A (Ku tolovela ndhavuko wa ndhawu leyintshwa - Paying respects to the new region) is *part* of the answer, the text emphasizes the *respect and understanding* shown *to* the travelers. Option B encompasses both of these aspects.

Options C and D are incorrect as they are not mentioned in the text.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, ku hlangahlangana ku nga ha tika swinene eka mufambi wa muxaka muni?","The correct answer is **A: Vafambi lava tikeriwaka hi ku tolovela ndhavuko lowuntshwa.**

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where travelers are delaying their return home because they are staying at a different location longer than planned. This delay is causing them to miss their usual routines (like tending to their farms) and leading to a buildup of work.  Therefore, the travelers who are experiencing this delay and are therefore negatively impacted by it are the ones who are staying at the new location longer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vafambi lava hatlisaka va tolovela ku hanya entsungeni:** The passage doesn't mention travelers delaying their return due to traveling further afield.
* **C: Vafambi va ha ri eka xiyimo xa ntsako lowukulu:** The passage doesn't mention any crisis situation.
* **D: Vafambi lava nga kotiki ku lehisa mbilu:** The passage explicitly states that it is *necessary* to be understanding and patient with returning travelers.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi vanhu va nga fanelangiki ku xi endla hi moose?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku xi tshinelela hi ku nonoka** (To tempt it with food).

Here's why:

The passage states that people sometimes tempt moose with food if they see that the moose doesn't have antlers.  The passage also mentions that this can lead to problems because the moose then becomes used to being fed and may become aggressive if it doesn't get food.  Therefore, ""Ku xi tshinelela hi ku nonoka"" is the action people shouldn't do.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku honisa vukona bya xona** (To improve its ability): The passage doesn't mention anything about improving the moose's ability.
* **C: Ku tekela ehansi nxungeto wa xona** (To cut down its antlers): The passage doesn't mention anything about cutting down antlers.
* **D: Ku swi languta u ri ekule** (To move it elsewhere): The passage doesn't mention moving the moose.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi malunghana ni moose hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **A: I swiharhi swa vukarhi hi ntumbuluko (The reason is due to the deer's camouflage)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the deer's camouflage is so effective that they are often missed even when they are close. 
* It then explains that people may put up feeders because they *don't see* the deer, implying the camouflage is responsible for the lack of visibility.
* Option A directly reflects this reasoning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nkarhi wun’wana a swi tekiwi swi ri nxungeto (Sometimes they don't come for food)** - While this *might* be true, it's not the primary reason for people setting up feeders based on the passage. The passage focuses on the deer being difficult to see.
* **C: Swi nga ha titwa swi xungetiwa loko vanhu va swi tshinelela (They might be seen as fed when people feed them)** - This is a consequence, not the *reason* people set up feeders.
* **D: Swa tilwela loko swi boha (They fight when they mate)** - This is irrelevant to the reason people set up feeders.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga na khombo leri nga nyawuriki eka mufambi wa le mananga?","The correct answer is **A: Ku pfumala swiambalo swo kufumela evusikwini byo titimela** (Hallucinations of shimmering objects in the sky).

Here's why:

The provided text describes a condition where a traveler sees shimmering objects (which could be water or other things) that disappear when the traveler approaches.  It also mentions the traveler experiences weakness and dehydration. The passage further states that strong hallucinations can occur, particularly when the traveler doesn't sleep.

Option A directly reflects this description. The shimmering objects are a type of hallucination.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ku vona miraji leyi langutekaka onge i mati** (Seeing shimmering mirages that look like water): This is partially correct, but not the best answer because the text implies the shimmering objects could be *other* things as well, not *only* water.
* **C: Ku heta matimba u ri karhi u landzelela miraji** (Getting weak while constantly following mirages): While weakness is mentioned, the text doesn't explicitly link weakness to *following* the mirages.  It's more about the mirages appearing and disappearing.
* **D: Ku heta mati u ri karhi u landzelela miraji** (Getting thirsty while constantly following mirages):  Again, the text doesn't explicitly link thirst to *following* mirages. It mentions dehydration, but not a direct cause-and-effect relationship with mirage pursuit.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi boxiwiki tanihi nxungeto eka vafambi va le mananga?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku pfumaleka ka mati (Water scarcity)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where travelers in a desert encounter mirages (visions of water). It also mentions that when travelers leave these mirages, they are often weakened by thirst and lack water. The passage further alludes to the dangers of dehydration and the importance of not sweating.

Therefore, the most direct and accurate consequence mentioned in the text related to the described scenario is **water scarcity/lack of water**. The mirages are a trick of the light indicating the absence of water.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Timiraji (Mirages):** While mirages are mentioned, they are a *symptom* of the problem, not the consequence itself.
*   **C: Ku khomiwa hi xirhami (Dehydration):** Dehydration is a *result* of the lack of water described, not the immediate consequence.
*   **D: Ku hisiwa hi dyambu (Being attacked by snakes):** This is not mentioned in the passage.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi vahi vanhu lava khumbekeke swinene endzhaku ka ku fika ka vavalangi?","The correct answer is **C: Mataino**.

The text states: ""Eka malembe mangari mangani ku fike vakambisisi vale Yuropa, nhlayo ya vanhu va Mataino yi hunguteke swinene hikwalaho ka leswi va hluriweke hi vanhu va le eSpaniya.""  This translates to: ""Many years after the arrival of European explorers, the population of the Taíno people declined sharply due to the atrocities committed by the Spanish people.""

Therefore, the Taíno people suffered the most significant population decline after the arrival of the Europeans.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rihi rimi leri vulavuriwaka hi Makharabiya?","The correct answer is **D: Xiarawakan**. 

Here's why:

The text states that the Taíno people were indigenous to Hispaniola, and the Caribbean people were Arawakan-speaking people who arrived there around 10,000 BCE.  Therefore, the language spoken by the Caribbean people is Arawakan."
I mani loyi a endleke leswaku ku rheta egambokweni ku duma tanihi ntlangu wo tihungasa?,"The correct answer is **B: Vanorwegia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ntlango wa ku rheta eka gamboko i ntlangu lowu endliwaka ngopfu loko u ri eka riendzo, lowu vanhu vo tala va wu tsakelaka naswona va wu vitana “ski bums”, naswona va hlela ku tihumesa leswaku va ya wu endla laha wu endliwaka kona. Ntlango wa ku rheta eka gambokweni i wa xikhale-swifaniso leswi kovotliweke emaribyeni leswi kombisaka lava endlaka ntlango lowu i swa va ma 5000 BC! Ku endla ntlango wa ku rheta eka gambokweni eswirhelelweni swi sungule hilembexidzana ra vu 17 na hi 1861 clilabu yo sungula yi pfule hi vanorwegia eAustraliya.""

This translates to: ""The language of skiing is a language that is often used when you are doing an activity, which early people called “ski bums”, and they planned to punish those who did it where it was done. The language of skiing is ancient, depicted in cave paintings dating back to 5000 BC! The language of skiing began in the 17th and 1861 centuries with a club founded by Norwegians in Australia.""

Therefore, the Norwegians are credited with starting the language of skiing in the modern sense. While ""ski bums"" was a derogatory term, and people lived in the mountains, the Norwegians *founded the club* that initiated the modern skiing language.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i nkarhi wihi laha ku rheta egambokweni ku sunguleke ku tekiwa tanihi ntlangu?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 BC**.

The passage states: ""Ntlango wa ku rheta eka gamboko i wa xikhale-swifaniso leswi kovotliweke emaribyeni leswi kombisaka lava endlaka ntlango lowu i swa va ma 5000 BC!"" which translates to ""The language of surfing is among the oldest symbols found in paintings which depict people performing the language that dates back to 5000 BC!""

Therefore, surfing (or the language associated with it) originated around 5000 BC.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi fambisanaka ni xihlala lexikulu xa le ribuweni ra vuxa bya Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: Nkucetelo wa le Yuropa (European colonization)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nkucetelo wa Yuropa na vukoloni swi sungule hi lembe xidzana ra vu 15..."" (European colonization began in the 15th century...).  This directly links European colonization to significant changes in the African continent.

While the other options are mentioned, they are not presented as the *primary* or overarching factor shaping the continent's development. The passage highlights European colonization as a major turning point.



"
Hi xihi lexi nga riki xihlawulekisi xa swihlala leswitsongo swa Afrika Vuxa? ,"The correct answer is **A: Vuxaka na Furwa (Arab and Islam)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Maarabiya va tise Vuisilamu eka tindhawu leti, naswona byi tinyike matimba eKhomorosi na Mayotte.""  This translates to ""Arabs and Muslims in these places, and they gained power in Comoros and Mayotte.""  This demonstrates the significant influence of Arab and Islamic cultures and languages on the linguistic landscape of Swahili-speaking Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tindhawu ta vaendzi ta manyunyu to tala (Early Malay settlements):** While there was some Malay influence, the passage doesn't mention it as a significant factor in the language.
* **C: Ndhuma ya ku va ni swiharhi (Its history of migrations):** Migration played a role, but the passage highlights specific cultural influences (Arab and Islamic) more directly.
* **D: Ku tiyimela handle ka matiko man’wana (Its close connection with other languages):** While Swahili is related to other languages, the passage focuses on *what* influences *its* linguistic makeup.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana Xilalelo xa Hosi xi tlangeriwa njhani ngopfungopfu hi tikereke tin’wana leti tolovelekeke?","The correct answer is **B: Ku endla murindzelo wa Mugqivela nivusiku.**

The passage states: ""Tikereke to tala titolovele ku khoma Xilalelo Xa Hosi hi vusiku bya Muqhivela wa mahelovhiki ya Xilalelo xa Hosi, laha mavandla ma toloveleke ku tlangela ku pfuxiwa ka Kreste exikarhi ka vusiku."" This translates to: ""Early churches began to hold Holy Communion on the evening of Maundy Thursday, when the congregation gathered to celebrate the Last Supper of Christ at midnight.""  This clearly indicates a midnight service.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku endla nkhuvo wo veleka (Having a solemn fast):** While fasting might be practiced in connection with Holy Week, the passage doesn't mention a general solemn fast.
* **C: Ku va ni xinkhubyana xa ximun’wana xa kereke (Having a joint agreement between churches):** The passage doesn't discuss agreements between different churches.
* **D: Ku hlalela dyambu loko ri xa (Observing the washing of feet):** Washing of feet is a separate event that happens *during* Holy Communion, not the entire event itself.



"
"Ku papalata swilaveko swin’wana loko u nghena aEcuador, muaki wa le Cuba u fanele a rhanga a va na yini?","The correct answer is **C: Thikithi ro komba leswaku tshame masiku mangani.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Loko u vuya u fanele u va na tikhithi leri nga ta komba leswaku u tshame masiku mangani."" which translates to ""When you arrive, you should have a ticket that shows how many days you will stay.""

While the other options are relevant to entering Ecuador, the question specifically asks about documents to have *when arriving*.
"
Xana i yini leswi swilaveko swa ku famba swa le Ecuador swi nga endleriwangiki swona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku famba hi ndlela leyi hlelekeke**.

The text states: ""Swilaveko leswi swi endleriwe leswaku ku ta va na ku hleleka loko ku fambiwa eka matiko lawa mambirhi."" This translates to ""Measures have been taken so that there is order when traveling between these two countries."" Therefore, organized travel is one of the consequences/measures taken.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku pima nhlayo ya vafambi yi nga tali** (Tracking traveler's movements is not accurate): The text doesn't mention tracking traveler's movements.
* **C: Ku tiyisisa masiku lawa mufambi a nga ta ma tshama** (Confirming the number of days the traveler intends to stay): While the text *does* mention confirming the number of days, it's not presented as a general consequence of travel, but a specific requirement for obtaining a visa.
* **D: Ku tiyisisa vutirhiseki bya tiphasipoto** (Confirming passport validity):  The text *does* mention passport validity, but again, it's a specific requirement, not a general consequence of travel.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga durhaka etikweni rin’wana ku tlula ekaya?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndzindzakhombo wo hakelela matihlo (Gloves)**.

The text states: ""kuna ndzindzakhombo wo hakelela matihlo kutani u famba na papila ra kona leswaku ri ya tatiwa kwala u yaka kona."" This directly translates to ""and gloves to pick up the waste and walk with paper so that it is taken where you left it.""

Therefore, gloves are the items mentioned as being used to handle waste and prevent the spread of germs.
"
Hi rihi khombo leri nga vangiwaka hi ku xava tifiremu to durha eka tiko rin’wana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku nga ha laveka xikambelo xa mahlo lexi engetelekeke**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the spread of eye infections.  It states that contaminated surfaces can spread the infection.  Therefore, a contagious eye infection is the most likely consequence of leaving contaminated frames in a shared location.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Papila ra dokodela swi nga endleka ri nga tirhi eka tifuremu tin’wana:** While it's possible for medical papers to carry germs, the primary concern is direct contact with the infected eye discharge.
* **C: Ti nga ha tshuka ti nga vi ta xiviri:** This is a possibility, but less directly related to the immediate risk associated with shared frames.
* **D: Ndzindzakhombo wu nga ha tshuka wu nga hakeleli swikoxo:** This is incorrect. The passage specifically mentions using tissues to stop the spread of discharge.
"
"Malunghana ni ku tirhisiwa ka mali eFalklands, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga ntiyiso?","The correct answer is **A: Ku amukeriwa makhadi ya swikweleti ni pound ya le Britain eswihlaleni swa le kule.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ko tala Pound ya le Britain yi xava kun’wani na kun’wani eswihlaleni naswona makhadi ya swikweleti ni dolara ya le United State na swona swa xava eStanley."" This confirms that both British Pounds and credit cards are accepted in Stanley.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Stanely hi yona ndhawu ntsena leyi amukelaka dolara ya le United States:** The passage says US dollars are *also* accepted, but doesn't specify that Stanley is the *only* place they are.
* **C: Ti-pound ti fanele ku cinciwa u nga si suka exihlaleni:** The passage states the opposite: ""rhanga hi ku vutisa n’wini wa xitolo ka ha ri na nkarhi ku tiva loko a yi amukela."" implying you *can* exchange pounds within the Falklands.
* **D: Handle ka pound ya le Falkland, pound ya le Britain hakanyingi i mali leyi amukeriwaka:** While British Pounds are accepted, the passage doesn't say they are *frequently* accepted; it mentions that exchanging currency is necessary when you arrive in the Falklands.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, loko u ya eFalklands ku suka eUnited States, hi kwhi laha ndlela yin’wana yo hakela yi nga pfunaka swinene ku tlula khadi ra xikweleti?","The correct answer is **A: Exitolo xa FIC West**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mali yi cincisiwa ntsena etibangi ta le swihlaleni leswi kumekaka eStanley endzhaku ka xitolo xa FIC West."" (Money is exchanged at the locations outside Stanley after the FIC West store.)

The question asks where it's best to exchange money *before* using a credit card. Since the passage links money exchange at locations outside Stanley *after* the FIC West store to the need to exchange money *before* using a credit card, the FIC West store is the logical place to do so.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Eswihlaleni hinkwaswo:** This is too vague. The passage specifies a particular location.
*   **C: Eswihlaleni swa le kule:** This is also vague and doesn't relate to the specific context of the passage.
*   **D: Endhawini hinkwayo ya Stanely:** The passage states that money exchange *after* FIC West happens outside of Stanley."
Hi xihi xiendlakalo lexi nga fambisaniki ni ku tlangeriwa ka swinkhubyana swa tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tswariwa ka ndlopfu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that temple festivals often include animal sacrifices, the procession of sacred elephants, and other significant events.  The other options are related to calendar dates or religious ceremonies, but animal sacrifice (specifically, the birth of an elephant) is explicitly mentioned as a common occurrence during these festivals.



"
Xana tindlopfu to sasekisiwa ti nga voniwa kwihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Etitempeleni**.

The text states: ""Minkhuvo ya tempele ya Kerala ya tsakisa swinene ku yi vona, ni ntlawa wa tindlopfu leti khavisiweke ti ri karhi ti famba, ntlawa wa vayimbeleri va orchestra va le tempeleni ni minkhuvo yin’wana.""

This translates to: ""The temple festivals of Kerala are greatly celebrated, with processions of elephants, a choir of temple singers, and other gatherings.""

Therefore, the elephants (tindlopfu) are seen *at the temple* (etitempeleni). Options A and C are too broad, and D is incorrect.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi yihi ndlela leyi tolovelekeke yo hlayisa mali ebindzwini kumbe eka hakelo ya xihahampfhuka ya xiyenge lexi nga durhiki?","The correct answer is **A: Ku yi tirhisa eka khampani ya wena.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that companies have noticed a trend of dishonest individuals demanding upfront payments, claiming they'll deliver after a quick, successful job. They've responded by implementing a policy where payments are made through the company itself. This is to ensure accountability and prevent fraudulent practices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku buka eka xiyenge lexi durhiki ku tlula xa bindzu:** This is not mentioned in the text and doesn't align with the company's policy.
* **C: Ku buka xihahampfhuka lexi nga fambiki hi ku kongoma:** The text discourages transporting stolen materials.
* **D: Ku kuma mintshovo ya mali:** This is simply not a solution offered or implied by the text.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga vaka ku tlanga hi nkarhi ku xi secha loko u buka hi ntsengo wa swiyenge swin’wana?","The correct answer is **A: Swihahampfhuka leswi fambaka hi ku kongoma (Hair that is carried by sweeping)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Hi ntolovelo, a swi pfuni ku langutela ku hunguteriwa nxavo wa ku khandziya xihaha-mpfuka eka xiyenge lexi tlakukeke ngopfu xa mabindzu kumbe xa le henhu kuya eka ndhawu yin’wana hi ku kongoma.""  This translates to: ""In principle, we do not want to investigate the taxation of sweeping hair from one place to another by collecting it.""

This indicates that hair carried by sweeping (and therefore potentially collected and moved) is a factor that causes issues with pricing.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Xiyenge xa bindzu (Dusty hair)** While dust is present, the text focuses on the *movement* of hair by sweeping.
* **C: Mintshovo ya mali (Money shortages)**  The text discusses pricing based on the labor involved in hair removal, not money shortages.
* **D: Xiyenge xo durha (Expensive hair)** The text discusses the pricing of hair removal services, not the intrinsic value of the hair itself.



"
I yini lexi nga bohiki ku katsiwa loko u pimanisa ntsengo hinkwawo wo ya eAfrika swin’we ni ntsengo wa misava hinkwayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntsengo wa tivhisa leti engetelekeke ehandle ka le Afrika** (The cost of additional travel expenses in areas handling Africa).

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the additional costs beyond the base airfare.** The text explicitly mentions calculating the total cost, including things like taxes, fees, travel insurance, and other expenses *in areas that handle Africa*.
* **Option A directly addresses this.** It focuses on the extra costs needed for travel within and around Africa.
* **Options B, C, and D are too narrow.**  While taxes (B) and travel costs (C) are part of the total,  ""cost of additional travel expenses"" (A) is the most comprehensive and accurate description of what needs to be calculated.  Option D is too vague.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini swilo swo hambanahambana leswi switolo swi sungulaka ku swi xavisa?","The correct answer is **A: Swakudya leswi se swi swekiweke**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many stores offer pre-cooked food for customers to take away. It explicitly mentions that when it's busy, they cook the food for customers to take home. While microwaves and restaurants might be present, the *primary* thing that makes a store a takeaway food store is offering *pre-cooked food*.  ""Minxavo yo chipa"" (cheap prices) is a characteristic, but not the defining feature of a takeaway food store.
"
Hi xihi xitirhisiwa lexi kumekaka eswitolo lexi nga tshukaka xi tsakisa khasitama lexi xavaka swakudya leswi swekiweke?,"The correct answer is **D: Makhrowevhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tindhawu to xavisa swakudya se ti ya ti xavisa swakudya swo hambanahambana swo swekiwa. Tin'wana ti veka na timakhrowevhi eswitolo kumbe ti lava tindlela tin'wana to kufumeta swakudya."" This directly mentions microwaves as a way stores provide hot food for customers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tirhesturente endzeni ka switolo** - While some stores *might* have a restaurant, the passage doesn't say this is a universal or primary way to provide hot food.
* **B: Nhlawulo wa swilo switsongo** - This refers to the freshness of ingredients, not a method for heating prepared food.
* **C: Swakudya leswi nga swekiwangiki** - This refers to uncooked food, not food that is already prepared and needs to be heated.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga tshukaka xi nga twisisiwi hi vanhu va le Beligium ni va le Switzerland lava vulavulaka Xifurwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Mavitanelo yo karhi ya marito ya Xifurwa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the *way names are formed* differs significantly between the Flemish/Belgian/Swiss dialects and Standard German (the German spoken in Germany).  This difference in naming conventions is the key reason why speakers of Flemish/Belgian/Swiss German might struggle to understand standard German.  They are accustomed to different patterns of how names are constructed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Endlelo ro tirhisa tinomboro leri tolovelekeke eFurwa:** While there might be some differences in how numbers are expressed, the passage doesn't highlight this as a major barrier to understanding.
* **B: Marito yo karhi ya Xifurwa:**  The passage says the words themselves are similar, not drastically different.  The difference lies in the formation and combination of words.
* **D: Xifurwa lexi hakanyingi xi vulavuriwaka eFurwa:** The passage focuses on the differences in *how* German is spoken in different regions, not on the frequency of certain words.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga faniki eFurwa ni le Belgium kumbe Switzerland?,"The best answer is **B: Endlelo ro tirhisa tinomboro**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Xifurwa lexi vulavuriwaka eBelgium na Switzerland ku na ku hambana lokuntsoongo na loku ku nga tolovelekangiki ngopfu ngopfu eka tinomborho ku na Xifurwa lexi vulavuriwaka eFurwa...""  This directly addresses the differences in how numbers are written (the system used).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mavitanelo ya marito hinkwawo (Word order variations):** While the passage mentions differences in word order, the main focus of the comparison is on the number system.
* **C: Xifurwa xa ntolovelo lexi dyondzisiwaka eswikolweni (Formal written language):** The passage touches on the language used in schools, but it's not the central difference being highlighted.
* **D: Ku peletiwa ka marito yo karhi ya Xifurwa (Capitalization of words):** The passage mentions differences in capitalization, but again, the core difference is in the number system.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the passage's main point.
"
Hi le ka xiyimo xihi laha u nga tshukaka u nga nyikiwi mali ya ku loveriwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Loko u ringeta ku buka ekhampanini ya xihahampfhuka hi ku kongoma ematshan’weni yo tirhisa muyimeri**.

Here's why:

The question asks what situation would prevent you from receiving baggage fees. The passage states that baggage fees are typically charged when booking through the airline's website. Option B directly reflects this scenario.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Loko u famba hi xihahampfhuka xa WestJet:** The text doesn't mention WestJet specifically as an airline where baggage fees aren't collected.
*   **C: Loko u famba hi xihahampfhuka xa Lufthansa ku suka eParis ku ya eUnited States:** The passage only mentions Lufthansa as an airline that *does* charge baggage fees.
*   **D: Loko u famba hi xihahampfhuka xa Delta:** Similar to Lufthansa, the text only mentions Delta as an airline that *does* charge baggage fees.

Therefore, option B is the only one aligned with the text's information about where baggage fees are typically collected."
Hi wihi leswi nga ntiyiso hi tihakelo ta ku loveriwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti fanele ku bukiwa hi ku kongoma eka webusayiti ya xihahampfhuka xexo.**

Here's why:

* The provided text states: ""Eka swiyimo hikwaswo, u fanele u buka hi foyini eka khampani ya swihaha mpfhuka."" This means you need to book through the airline's website.
* Option B directly reflects this instruction: ""Ti fanele ku bukiwa hi ku kongoma eka webusayiti ya xihahampfhuka xexo"" (You should book through the airline's website).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti hlanganisa ntsengo wa ku ya enkosini:** While the cost to get to the airport is a factor, the text focuses on the airline ticket itself.
* **C: Ti hlanganisa mitsengo ya ku famba hi timinete ta makumu:**  The text mentions the cost of flights between airports but doesn't say that the airport transfer cost is part of the travel budget.
* **D: Ti fanele ku bukiwa hi ku kongoma ekhampanini ya xihahampfhuka hi foni:** The text explicitly says to book *online* (""hi foyini""), not by phone.



"
Hi rini laha ku tirhisa xitirhisiwa xa GPS leyi tiyimeleke swi nga olovaka ku tlula ku tirhisa tiapp leti pfumelaka GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: Loko u famba endhawini leyi nga le kule**.

Here's why:

* **GPS devices are specifically designed for locations with poor or no cellular data or Wi-Fi.** They rely on satellite signals, making them ideal for remote areas where app-based GPS might be unreliable.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Loko u ringeta ku hlayisa mali:** While cost is a factor, it doesn't directly relate to *when* a standalone GPS device is preferable.
* **B: Loko u tiyiseka leswaku u ta kota ku tirhisa data:**  This is the *opposite* of a situation where a standalone GPS would be better.
* **D: Loko u nga swi lavi ku rentisa xitirhisiwa:**  This is a preference, not a functional reason for using a standalone GPS.



"
Hi xihi xivangelo lexi nga riki xinene xo tirhisa app leyi pfumelaka GPS ematshan’weni ya xitirhisiwa lexi tiyimeleke?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku papalata ku rentisa**.

Here's why:

The question asks how to avoid the costs associated with using a GPS app on a phone. The text mentions that using the GPS app can drain your phone's battery and requires data or good internet connection, which can incur costs.

Option C, ""Ku papalata ku rentisa"" (Renting), directly addresses this by suggesting renting a dedicated GPS device instead of relying on your phone's GPS functionality. This avoids battery drain on your phone and potential data charges.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku ka u nga lavi ku vilerisiwa hi ku tirhiseka ka data** (You might not want to be limited by data usage): While this is a consequence of using a phone's GPS, it doesn't suggest a solution.
* **B: Ku hlayisa mali** (Save money): This is a general goal, but it doesn't specify *how* to achieve it in the context of using a GPS.
* **D: Ku ka u nga lavi ku xava mimepe leyintshwa** (You might not want to buy a new map): This is related to updating maps, not avoiding the costs of using a GPS device itself.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, u nga tiyisisa njhani leswaku u kume xikepe lexi faneleke?","The correct answer is **C: Ku buka hi ku tirhisa muyimeri loyi a tirhanaka ni ku famba hi Galapagos.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes the importance of choosing a boat that is suitable for Galapagos.** The text highlights the large number of boats available and the varying sizes and capacities.
* **Option C directly addresses this need.** A reputable tour operator will have boats specifically designed and equipped for Galapagos travel, taking into account factors like size, stability, and suitability for wildlife viewing.
* **Other options are less relevant:**
    * **A:** While having a group of 8+ people is important for booking, it doesn't guarantee a suitable boat.
    * **B:** Booking well in advance is always good, but it doesn't ensure the boat is appropriate.
    * **D:** Booking without sufficient time is a bad idea, and doesn't address the crucial aspect of boat suitability.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga tirhisiwiki tanihi ndlela yo kucetela vaendzi ku hambeta va gembula?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tirhisa swinene ku vonakala ka ntumbuluko (Creating a strong impression of legitimacy)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how casinos lure people in with attractive offerings like food, drinks, and entertainment. This creates the *impression* of a legitimate and enjoyable place, making people less cautious.  Option A directly addresses this – casinos create a false sense of security and legitimacy to encourage gambling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku nyika swilo swo tanihi mathikithi ya mahala ya tikhonsati (Providing free concert tickets):**  While this is an enticement, it doesn't directly address the core tactic described in the passage, which is creating a sense of legitimacy.
* **C: Swonwa swa mahala (Free drinks):** Similar to concert tickets, free drinks are a lure, but don't focus on the deception of legitimacy.
* **D: Ku tshika ku vekela tiwachi (Constantly placing clocks):** This tactic is described in the passage as a way to make gamblers lose track of time, but it's not the primary way casinos initially draw people in.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, mugemburi loyi a tlhariheke u fanele ku papalata yini?","The correct answer is **B: Ku amukela swo n’wi kucetela ku hambeta a tlanga.**

Here's why:

The passage describes how casinos exploit vulnerable people by offering things like food, drinks, and entertainment to keep them playing. It also mentions the addictive nature of gambling and how it can lead to financial ruin and even criminal activity.

Therefore, if a gambler is already struggling, the most appropriate response is to seek help and support to change their behavior and avoid further harm.  Option B, ""Ku amukela swo n’wi kucetela ku hambeta a tlanga"" (Accepting help and seeking to change), aligns with this advice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku nwa byalwa byo tala** (Drinking alcohol first): This is a dangerous and potentially harmful choice. It could worsen the gambling problem and lead to poor decisions.
*   **C: Ku kamba swokombankarhi kumbe tiwachi** (Borrowing money or taking out loans):  This would only increase the gambler's debt and financial problems.
*   **D: Ku vutisa nyangwa wo huma lowu nga ekusuhi** (Taking out a loan from a shady source): This is extremely risky and could lead to predatory lending practices and even further exploitation.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xiyenge xa mbulavulo lexi tsariwaka hi letere lerikulu exikarhi ka xivulwa?","The correct answer is **A: Maendli**.

The passage states: ""Maviti hinkwawo, swin’we na vito leri nge Sie leri vulaka wena, ya sungula hi malatere lama kulu minkarhi hinkwayo, hambi ko va exikarhi ka xivulwa. Leyi i ndlela ya nkoka ya ku hambanisa **maendli** man’wana eka xiendliwa.""

This translates to: ""Recently, the names and letters from someone you know started with large letters at various times, until they appeared at the time of the release. This is the necessary way to align the **letters** with the released thing.""

Therefore, the answer is **Maendli** (letters).
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga endlaka swi nonon’hwa loko riviti ri tsariwe hi letere lerikulu?","The correct answer is **A: Ku hlaya**.

The passage states: ""Naswona ku nga vuriwa leswaku yi endla ku hlaya ku olova..."" which translates to ""It can also be said that it leads to clarity of the assault...""  Therefore, the primary effect of the large letter is to bring clarity. While the other options might be *secondary* effects, clarity is the main point.
"
"Emalayinini ya le Malaysia, hi xihi xikoweto lexi vulaka “tanani”?","The correct answer is **A: Ku khotsa ritiho ra ku komba**.

The passage states that in Malaysian Malay culture, ""tanani"" refers to a gesture that resembles pointing when someone is angry and then slowly stroking the face, similar to a ritual in other parts of Southeast Asia.  This is described as a gesture of **pointing** and then a slow stroking motion. Therefore, ""ku khotsa ritiho ra ku komba"" (to imitate the gesture of pointing) is the best description.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xikoweto lexi nga ha vulaka “vuya”?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tlakusa xandla xi langute endzeni (Pressing the palm downwards)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a gesture in Malaysia where ""tanani"" (pressing the palm downwards) is a sign of respect, similar to bowing in other Southeast Asian countries. It also mentions a British traveler misunderstanding a similar gesture in Spain as a sign of being stopped and potentially assaulted.

Therefore, the question asks what gesture is associated with ""vuya"" (which refers to the ""tanani"" gesture).  The passage explicitly states that ""tanani"" involves pressing the palm downwards.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi vangelaka ku pandzeka?","The correct answer is **A: Mabuloho ya gamboko**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Leswi swi ta vangela ku pandzeka, ku pfuleka swinene ka ndhawu leyi pandzekeke, leyi yi tumbetiwaka hi mabuloho ya gamboko.""  This translates to: ""These things will cause the ground to collapse, to swell greatly at the collapsed place, which is undermined by bamboo roots.""

While the other options are related to the problem, the text directly identifies **bamboo roots** as the cause of the ground collapsing.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi i yini lexi nga tumbetiwaka hi mabuloho ya gamboko?","The correct answer is **A: Ku pandzeka** (Collapsing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leswi swi ta vangela ku pandzeka..."" which translates to ""These things can cause collapsing...""

While the passage mentions other things that *contribute* to the collapsing (like mud and debris), the primary thing being caused by the mud and debris is **collapsing (ku pandzeka)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mabakwa lama nga na gwitsi (Debris with worms):** This is a contributing factor, but not what is directly being caused.
*   **C: Marhangu (Bones):** Bones are mentioned as being found, but not as the direct cause of the collapse.
*   **D: Tibuloko letikulu (Large blocks):** Large blocks can fall *because* of the collapse, but the collapse itself is the main event.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, vafambi va fanele ku va ni vuxiyaxiya lebyi engetelekeke va nga endzela ndhawu yihi?","The correct answer is **A: Vholkheno ya Nyiragongo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Goma yi tlhela ri tirhisiwa tanihi ndhawu yo khandziya vholkheno ya Nyiragongo swinwe ni Tintshava leti Timfenhe ti fambaka eka tona eAfrika."" This translates to ""Goma has become a place to observe the Nyiragongo volcano and the Timfenhe lava flows that travel across Africa.""

The question asks where travelers should be aware of unusual risks. The Nyiragongo volcano is specifically mentioned as a source of danger and a major attraction.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tindhawu ta le kusuhi na Goma:** While the dry lands and Goma are relevant to the context, the specific unusual risk is tied to the volcano.
* **C: Entsindza wa doroba:** This translates to ""the city center.""  While potentially risky in general, the text doesn't highlight the city center as a *specific* unusual risk.
* **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda is mentioned as a potential area for conflict but isn't the primary location of the unusual risk described in the text.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xitsundzuxo lexinene eka vapfhumba vo ya eGoma?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku lwa loku nga kona le North Kivu ka nyanyula (There is ongoing conflict in North Kivu)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that after the Nyiragongo volcano eruption, ""maendzo hinkwawo lama endliwaka eka ndhawu leyi yinga le handle ka Goma ya fanele ya lavisisiwa leswaku u ta tiva xiyimo xa tinyimpi leti nga kona eN’walungu wa xifundzha nkulu xa Kivu."" (Changes made to the area surrounding Goma had to be taken into consideration to prevent military conflicts in the larger North Kivu province).  This indicates a continuing conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: I ndhawu leyinene ya ya ku Landzelerisisa Timfenhe ta le Ntshaveni leyi nga durhiki (It is a major hub for smuggling goods that are prohibited)** - While the passage mentions smuggling, it doesn't frame it as the *most significant* consequence or ongoing issue.
* **C: Tithekisi ta swithuthuthu i ndlela leyinene yo rhendzelaka hayona (Motorbikes are the most convenient way to get around)** -  The passage simply states that boda-boda are available and gives a price. It doesn't make a claim about convenience being the most important factor.
* **D: Ntsindza wa vholkheno ya Nyiragongo wu le dorobeni (The Nyiragongo volcano's lava reached the city)** - This is a fact *of* the eruption, but not a *consequence* that continues to affect people in the long run.  The passage focuses on the *ongoing conflicts* that followed.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is A.
"
Xana mpfumelelo wo dzima tendze emalayinini wa siku ro sungula ra August wu ta kumeka rini?,"The answer is **D: Ti-1 ta August**.

The passage states: ""Hikwalaho, loko u lava mpfumelelo wa malayini lama ya nga talangiki vanhu hi May wu kumeka hi 1 Jan."" This implies that the lottery for August is likely to happen around the same time as the May lottery, meaning **January 1st**. However, the question asks for the date the lottery for August will be held. The text says ""it was expected that the lottery would be held around the opening day of August,"" implying that the lottery happens on or around the first day of August. So, the most logical answer is **Ti-1 ta August**.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
Hi yihi pholisi leyi endleriweke ku sirhelela canyon?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tirha endlelo ro nyika mpfumelelo ka loyi a rhangaka a kombela.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""U fanele u kuma mpfumelelo wo dzima tende ra wena emalayinini ya le Grand Canyon. Mimpfumelelo yi pimiwe leswaku yi sirhelela khenyon, naswona yi kumeka eka siku ro sungula ra n’wheti..."" This implies that permits are needed and potentially limited. The following sentence says: ""Hikwalaho, loko u lava mpfumelelo wa malayini lama ya nga talangiki vanhu hi May wu kumeka hi 1 Jan."" This points to a lottery system.

The sentence ""Ku ni mimpfumelelo ya nhlayo leyi pimiweke"" (There are discounted permits that are sold) is true, but it doesn't explain *how* the permits are obtained to hike the trails.

Therefore, option A, ""Ku tirha endlelo ro nyika mpfumelelo ka loyi a rhangaka a kombela"" (There is a lottery system for permits for those who apply) accurately reflects the process described in the passage. Options B and C are not supported by the provided text. Option D is partially correct, but option A is more comprehensive and addresses the core of the permit system mentioned.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi nga kumeka eka tihotela lexi hlamuseriweke eka xiyenge lexi?,"The best answer is **C: Vapfhumba kuloni lava dumeke kumbe lava tivekaka (Ghosts of famous people or those who died there)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Nhundzu ya khale, ku pfumaleka ka tindhawu ta manguva lawa to tihungasa ni swilo swo karhi swa khale i swin’wana swa swilo leswi nga eka tona. Hambileswi hakanyingi ti nga ta vanhu vo karhi, minkarhi yin’wana ti rhurhela tihosi ni vachaviseki."" This directly translates to ""Old legends, there are stories of the places where people died and old things that might be in them. Often, it is said that there are spirits of the past, sometimes even ghosts and poltergeists.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Tindhawu to nwa byalwa byo hlawuleka (Abandoned rooms with decaying walls):** While decaying rooms *could* be present, the text doesn't emphasize this as a defining characteristic of these hotels.  The focus is on the *stories* and *spirits*.
* **B: Rhesturente yo hlawuleka endzeni ka muako (A decayed restaurant inside the building):**  Again, while a decayed restaurant might exist, the core theme of the text is not about physical decay, but about the spectral.
* **D: Makamara lama ha ku lunghisiwaka hi ndlela ya manguva lawa (Rooms that have not been renovated in the style of that time):** This is a possible detail, but again, it's not the central point. The hotels are known for their haunted reputation.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of what one might expect to find in a historically haunted hotel according to the given text.



"
"Hi ku landza rungula leri nga eka xiyenge lexi, eka swilo leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi vaendzi va le hotela va nga taka va nga xi rhangisi emahlweni?","The correct answer is **C: Ndhawu yo tihungasa ni vusiku (Nightclub)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes old hotels that were popular for entertainment, especially with wealthy people. It specifically mentions they offered places to dance and spend the night.  A nightclub is the most fitting option among the choices, reflecting the hotel's historical role in providing nighttime entertainment.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ku va ni fanichara ya xikhale eka muako hinkwawo (Old artifacts in the lobby):** While old artifacts *might* be present, the passage focuses on the *activities* that took place at the hotel, not just the objects.
* **B: Rhesturente leyi nga ni musweki wo hlawuleka (A restaurant with a well-known chef):** The passage mentions good food, but doesn't highlight a specific, famous chef as a key feature.
* **D: Makamara ya mitsengo leyi nga durhiki (Expensive rooms that are luxurious):**  The passage implies luxury, but doesn't emphasize that the expensive rooms were the primary draw. The entertainment aspect is highlighted more strongly.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi faneleke ku papalatiwa hi vapfhumba lava endzelaka Greenland?","The correct answer is **B: Ku ta ni swiambalo swo kufumela, hikuva maxelo hakanyingi ma hisa lembe hinkwaro.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Loko u endzela Greenland hi xixika (leswi loko uya uya en’walungwini, ku yaka ku titimela) swi lava u teka mpahla yo tala yo kufumela.""  This translates to ""When you travel to Greenland (especially if you go to the north, it means traveling) you need to take warm clothes first.""  

The passage also mentions ""Hambikuri emadorobeni a ku na “tindhawu to chavisa”"" which refers to places to change clothes. This indicates the need for warm layers and potentially changing clothes due to the cold.

Options A, C, and D are not directly supported by the text as the primary concern for travelers. While internet connectivity might be an issue (C), the main worry highlighted is the extreme cold.  The use of ""Eskimo"" (D) is presented as problematic due to its history, not as a primary challenge faced by travelers. Option B accurately reflects the core concern stated in the passage – the need for protection from the cold, which often includes warm layers and potentially dealing with the effects of the weather.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi va xiphiqo eka vapfhumba lava nga swi lunghekelangiki ku endzela Greenland?","The correct answer is **A: Tinsuna ta ndhawu yoleyo (All-weather gear)**.

Here's why:

The passage extensively details the challenges of the Greenlandic climate. It mentions:

*   **Extreme cold:**  The passage emphasizes the need for protective clothing due to freezing temperatures.
*   **Weather changes:** The passage points out that weather can change rapidly, potentially leading to dangerous situations.
*   **Remote locations:** The passage notes the prevalence of ""places to wait"" due to weather conditions that prevent travel.
*   **Risk of injury:**  The passage warns of potential injuries due to the harsh environment.

All these challenges underscore the importance of having suitable all-weather gear to survive and navigate Greenland safely. The other options, while mentioned, are not the primary, overarching risk associated with traveling to Greenland as highlighted in the text.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi sweswi xi tirhisiwaka tanihi plaza?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Sweswi wu tirha tanihi plaza..."" which translates to ""These things are used as a plaza..."" and the entire passage is about Jardín de la Unión.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga kumekiki le Jardín de la Unión?","The best answer is **A: Gazebo leyikulu leyi nga ni switirhisiwa**.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically mentions a gazebo:** ""Ku ni tirhesturente to tala leti nga rhendzeleka ntanga, naswona ninhlikani ni namadyambu ku ni tikhonsete leti voniwaka mahala ku sukela exikarhi ka gazebo."" This directly states the presence of a gazebo.
* **The other options are mentioned, but not as specifically or as a central feature:**
    * B (Kaya ha xitirho xa khale): While a historic house is mentioned (Callejon del Beso), it's presented as a historical landmark, not a primary feature of the Jardín de la Unión itself.
    * C (Tirhesiturente lexi rhendzeleke ntanga): The restaurant is mentioned, but it's past tense (""nga rhendzeleka ntanga""), implying it might no longer exist or is not a current highlight.
    * D (Muako wa khale wa vukhongeri):  The text mentions the historical origins of the park, but it doesn't focus on a specific historic structure as the key element to compare to.

Therefore, the large, usable gazebo is the most directly mentioned and arguably the most significant feature to compare with the Jardín de la Unión based on the provided text.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tekiwaka xi nga pakanisi malunghana ni ku hayika ninhlikanhi?","The correct answer is **D: Ku hayika ninhlikanhi a hi xiendlo lexi faneleke eka mindyangu leyi nga ni swihlangi.**

Here's why:

The passage states that children who are left alone are particularly vulnerable during travel and that there is a need for safety measures. It also mentions that parents with young children often lack adequate arrangements. The question asks what measures can be taken to prevent accidents and travel safely.

Option D directly addresses this by suggesting that proper precautions should be taken for families with young children. The passage implies that such precautions are necessary to prevent accidents.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ku laveka ku tilunghiselela kutsongo eku hayikeni ka ninhlikanhi eka tindlela to olova:** While school arrangements are important, the passage doesn't specifically focus on travel safety *to* school.
*   **B: Mimpfhuka ya siyana, kambe yi endleriwe ku hlanganisiwa hi siku:** This option is vague and doesn't directly address the safety concerns related to travel with children.
*   **C: Vanhu lava hanyeke kahle hi ntolovelo va swi kota ku tiphina hi sweswo:** This is not universally true and ignores the vulnerability of children with young ages.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi rini laha siku ro hayika ri lavaka ku lunghiselela loku nga nyawuriki?","The correct answer is **A: Loko loyi a hayikaka a tiyerile emirini** (When the person is adhering to the rules).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of planning and preparing for travel, especially for families with young children. It mentions that the distance traveled can be significant. The key point is that proper preparation, likely including adherence to safety rules and guidelines, is crucial to avoid accidents.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Loko ku tirhisiwa ndlela yo olova** (When reckless driving is used): This describes a *cause* of accidents, not a condition where preparation is important to *prevent* them.
*   **C: Loko vana va nghenela ku hayika** (When children enter the vehicle): This is a safety concern, but it doesn't directly address the timing or conditions where preparation is most critical.
*   **D: Loko ku hayikiwa endhawini ya ntumbuluko swinene** (When traveling in very crowded areas): While crowded areas can add complexity, the passage focuses on general preparation regardless of the specific location, but emphasizing adherence to rules is paramount.

Therefore, the passage implies that when travelers follow safety rules and guidelines, it's most important to prepare well to avoid accidents. This aligns with option A.



"
I yini lexi hambaneke hi tindhawu leti tlakukeke le Rogaland kumbe Agder loko ti pimanisiwa na Norway hinkwayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti ni misinya (They have mountains)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Rogaland and Agder are known as ""hei"" - areas with hills and mountains. 
* The question asks what is *different* about these areas compared to Norway in general.
* The text explicitly mentions mountains as a characteristic of these regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku hava tifjord (They have fjords):** The text describes Norway as being known for fjords, but it *doesn't* say that Rogaland and Agder are specifically known for them. In fact, the description of ""hei"" suggests they lack the deep fjords found elsewhere in Norway.
* **C: Tindhawu leti tlakukeke hakanyingi a ti tlhandluki ngopfu (These mountainous areas don't differ much):** The text implies they *do* differ, as they are specifically called ""hei"" and described in a way that sets them apart.
* **D: Hakanyingi ti funengetiwe hi heathera (Frequently covered in heather):** While heather is mentioned in the context of other mountainous regions, it's not specifically stated as a defining feature of Rogaland and Agder.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga kumekiki le Norway?","The correct answer is **A: Rivala leri pfulekeke swinene**.

Here's why:

The text states that Norway is known for fjords and mountains that are ""rivala"" (which translates to ""steep,"" ""rugged,"" or ""forested"" in English) and resemble a ""rivala"" landscape.  Option A directly reflects this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tindhawu leti nga ni mahlathi** (Mountains that are barren): The text mentions mountains but also describes them as forested and having heather.
*   **C: Tifjord to voyama swinene** (Fjords that are very deep): While fjords are mentioned, the text doesn't specifically focus on their depth.
*   **D: Tindhawu to pfumala misinya** (Mountains that are snow-capped): The text mentions mountains, but doesn't explicitly state they are snow-capped.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate reflection of the information given in the passage."
Xana hi rini laha vapfhumba lava tsakela ku rheta eka gamboko va faneleke ku endzela switsunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Hi xixika (Frequently)**.

Here's why: The passage states the eruptions are prone to occur at any time, but are *more likely* to happen during the monsoon season in India. It also mentions unpredictable eruptions. Therefore, the eruptions happen frequently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hi nkarhi lowu teleke vapfhumba (Occasionally):** The passage suggests eruptions are not occasional.
*   **C: Hi nkarhi wa ximumu xa le India (During the monsoon season):** While the passage mentions this as a period of higher probability, it doesn't mean it's the *only* time or that it only happens then.
*   **D: Hi ximun’wana (Sometimes):** The passage implies more than just ""sometimes"".



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rihi laha hakanyingi ku vaka ni vapfhumba vo tala eswitsungeni?","The correct answer is **A: Hi nkarhi wa gamboko yo tala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nkarhi wa vumpfhumba eka xitshunga yi tolovele ku tlakuka hi nkarhi wa ximumu le Indiya. Kambe, ku na swilo swo saseka swo hambana leswi vaka kona hi xixika, swin’we na tindhawu to tala ta xitshunga leti kumaka gamboko leyi yi nga talangiki ngopfu na leyi yi endlaka ku va na ntlangu wa ku rheta eka gamboko.""

This translates to: ""The emergence of earthquakes in the Earth's crust began at the time of the Earth's formation. However, there are various contributing factors that caused this, some places and ancient earthquakes showed very unpredictable earthquakes and caused the ground to shake.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that earthquakes started **at the time of the Earth's formation**, which is the Earth's earliest formation. Option A directly reflects this. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
I yini lexi u faneleke ku xi papalata loko u lava ku kuma xikepe laha ku lavekaka munhu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku navetisa hi vukorhokeri bya wena (Networking)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the process of finding a group by actively engaging with people, talking to them, and letting them know you're looking for a group. This is essentially networking – building connections and letting people know what you're interested in.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ku yingayinga ni swikepe leswi yimeke (There might not be any groups available):** While this *could* be true, it's not what you actively *do* to find a group.  It's a potential outcome, not a strategy.
*   **B: Ku titoloveta vakaputeni va swikepe (Relying on group leaders):** While talking to leaders is helpful, the passage emphasizes broader interaction with other members and creating connections.
*   **D: Ku honisa vahayiki van’wana va le swikepeni (Fixing other group members):** The passage is about *you* finding a group; it's not about fixing other people.



Therefore, **networking (C)** is the most accurate answer based on the passage's description of the process."
I yini lexi u faneleke ku xi endla etindhawini to yima swikepe loko u lava xikepe lexi lavaka mpfuno?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku tihlanganisa ni vatlutisi (Meet with the instructors)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the process of setting up a team for a competition. It mentions:

*   Setting up equipment
*   Preparing the area
*   Meeting with team members and coaches
*   Communicating with other teams.

Therefore, meeting with the instructors (vatlutisi) is a crucial step in the process of organizing a team for a competition. The other options are not as relevant:

*   B: Ku miyela (To move) - While you might move things around, it's not a core step in team setup.
*   C: Ku tshinelela vanhu ntsena loko va basisa swikepe swa vona (To welcome people when they are forming their teams) - This is part of the communication process, but not the *primary* step in organizing *your own* team.
*   D: Ku papalata vahayiki van’wana va le swikepeni (To criticize other team members) - This is negative and not a helpful part of the team setup.



"
Hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga tsakeriwaka hi mupfhumba loyi a lavaka ku tiva hi matimu ya xihlala hi nkarhi wa vakoloni?,"The correct answer is **B: Waterfront ya le Kowloon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Siya xihlala u ya eka ndhawu leyi languteneke na waterfront yale Kowloon."" which translates to ""You should always go to the peaceful place and the waterfront of Kowloon.""  It then connects the historical significance of the harbor to colonial history: ""Leswaku u lava vumbhoni bya matimu ya ku tekiwa ka ndhawu hi makoloni, u nga sungula kwahalani."" (If you want evidence of colonial history, you can start here).  This strongly indicates Kowloon's waterfront is the place to find evidence of colonial influence and the history of early settlements.



*   **A: Ribuwu ra le N’walungwini (British Colony)** - While historically significant, the passage doesn't explicitly tie the British Colony itself to the *evidence* of colonial history.
*   **C: Edorobeni ra Hong Kong (Hong Kong City)** - The passage focuses on the waterfront and Kowloon, not the city center itself.
*   **D: EVictoria Harbor (Victoria Harbor)** - Victoria Harbor is mentioned as the place where the tides are strong, but not specifically as a place to find colonial history.



"
Hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga tsakeriwaka hi mupfhumba loyi a rhangisaka emahlweni ku vona ku saseka ka ndhawu?,"The correct answer is **D: Waterfront ya le Kowloon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leswaku u vona tindhawu leti sasekeke ngopfu eHong Kong, siya xihlala u ya eka ndhawu leyi languteneke na waterfront yale Kowloon.""  This translates to: ""If you see these very scenic places in Hong Kong, you should always go to the peaceful and waterfront of Kowloon.""

The question asks where to go to see evidence of the colony's impact on the city. The waterfront of Kowloon is presented as a key location for observing this.
"
Xana tisala tin’wana ti na yini leswi pfunaka ku hunguta khombo ro va nenge wu phasiwa hi swo khwakanyisa?,"The passage discusses safety measures for ""switshego"" (likely referring to a type of protective covering or garment, potentially related to agriculture or work). It mentions that these coverings can pose a hazard if they get tangled or cause a person to get caught. It also mentions specific safety measures like using bright colors and durable materials.

The question asks what else is important to consider when using something that can cause entanglement. The options are:

*   **A: Tisoli to lala (Sleeping pillows)** - Irrelevant.
*   **B: Swisirhelelo (Comfort/Relaxation)** - Irrelevant.
*   **C: Swikhwakanyiso swa dzovo (Necklaces/Collars)** - While necklaces *can* cause entanglement, the passage is focusing on the *switshego* itself.
*   **D: Ku tshamiseka kahle (Good fit/Proper adjustment)** - This directly relates to the passage's concern about entanglement. A good fit minimizes the chances of the covering getting tangled or causing a person to get caught.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Ku tshamiseka kahle (Good fit/Proper adjustment)**. The passage implies that a proper fit is crucial for safety with the *switshego*.



"
Hi xihi xiyenge xa butsu yo gada lexi pfunaka ku antswisa vuhlayiseki bya mugadi loko a tirhisa swikhwakanyiso?,"The correct answer is **C: Xirhendze (Rope)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vakhandziyi vo tala va rhanga hi ku mbala tintanghu leti nga xitiga ni xirhendze lexi nga olova xithlela xi tontswa.""  This translates to ""Early watchmen tied colorful threads that could bite and a rope that could be tightened until it snapped.""

The question asks what is needed to prevent a guard from being strangled by a rope. Therefore, the answer is the **xirhendze (rope)**.
"
I yini leswi nyikiwaka vapfhumba hi fambiselo ra tindhawu to amukela?,"The correct answer is **A: Byetlelo eka vaaki va madoroba lava rhurhelaka vapfhumba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fambiselo ra tindhawu to amukela ni ku hungasa vavalangi i nhlangano lowu hlanganisaka vavalangi ni vaaki va madoroba lawa va nga ta ma endzela.""  This translates to ""Hostels and the organization of hostels bring together hostels and city dwellers who want to travel.""

The passage further explains Couchsurfing as a system where people offer free accommodation. Therefore, hostels provide *accommodation* (byetlelo) to travelers (vaaki va madoroba).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Swihahampfhuka swo chipa (Cheap adventures):** While Couchsurfing *can* be cheap, the primary offering of hostels isn't ""cheap adventures"" itself; it's free or low-cost accommodation.
* **C: Vuvalangi lebyi hleriwaka hi vaaki va madoroba (Information shared by city dwellers):**  While hosts *can* share information, it's not the core offering.
* **D: Ku tihlanganisa ni vapfhumba van’wana lava endzelaka ndhawu leyi fanaka (Meeting other travelers who have created a similar place):** Meeting others is a *potential* benefit, but not the defining feature of the hostel system itself.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka malunghana ni fambiselo ra tindhawu to amukela?","The correct answer is **C: Vapfhumba va ta nyikiwa nxaxamelo wa vaamukeri va vaendzi lava kumekaka edorobeni leyi va yaka eka rona.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Kutani ku rhumeriwa nxaxamelo wa vanhu lava rhurhelaka vavalangi lowu printiweke kumbe lowu nga eka inthanete, minkarhi yin’wana wu ri ni mavito ya vavalangi ni leswi va swi vuleke hi vanhu lava va va rhurheleke."" (Then a notice is sent to the hosts, either printed or online, which sometimes includes the names of the hosts and what they have offered.)
* This notice is sent *to the hosts* (the ones providing accommodation) and contains information about the guests who are coming to their city.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nkarhi hinkwawo vapfhumba va nyikiwa mavito ya lava amukelaka vaendzi emadorobeni** - The text doesn't say that hosts are given names of guests *before* the guest arrives. The notice is sent *when* the guest is coming.
* **B: Mafambiselo man’wana ma nga ha lava ku tiyisisa vapfhumba hilaha ku engetelekeke** - While the text mentions alternative methods of verification, it doesn't state that verification is *required* in all cases or that it's a common practice.
* **D: Ku kambisisa lava amukela vaendzi emadorobeni va kumeka nkarhi wun’wana eka vapfhumba** - The text clearly indicates that the notice is sent *to* the hosts, not *by* the hosts (to other hosts). It is a process involving information flow *to* the hosts.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mupfhumba wa muxaka muni loyi a nga tshukaka a kumeka eka ekamareni ra le hositela ra nhlanganelo?","The correct answer is **A: Muendzi loyi a nga kwalomu ka malembe ya makumembirhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tihositela ti rhurhela ngopfu vantshwa – vaendzi lava nga emalembeni ya kwalomu makume mambirhi..."" which translates to ""Hospitals are often filled with patients - people who have been in the hospital for two weeks..."" 

Therefore, the most accurate answer is the one that reflects this timeframe. Options B, C, and D don't align with the information provided.
"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a tshama ehositela?","The correct answer is **B: Vantshwa va malembe ya 22 lava fambaka swin’we**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...hi ntolovelo u nga va kuma ni vavalangi lava kuleke kwalaho. A swi tolovelekanga ku vona mindyangu leyi nga ni vana, kambe tihositela tin’wana ta yi pfumelela mindyangu ku tshama eka makamara ya le tlhelo.""  This implies that the hospital is primarily for younger people (""vantshwa va malembe ya 22"") who are experiencing difficulties. It also mentions adults (""vatekani"") who are going to the hospital.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Vatekani lava fambaka ni ricece:** The passage doesn't specifically mention people traveling with relatives.
*   **C: Vatekani lava nga emalembeni ya va-70:** The passage explicitly states the hospital isn't suitable for people in their 70s because of the lack of appropriate rooms.
*   **D: Mindyangu yimbirhi lexi fambaka ni vana va yona:** The passage states that hospitals don't usually accommodate mothers and children, but this hospital *does* accommodate mothers and children.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate based on the information provided."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuselaka hi ku kongoma ku hoxa ximhandzana lexi vatliweke lexi vitaniwaka Boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: Nkarhi hinkwawo xi tlhelela evokweni ra wena loko u xi hoxe kahle**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Loko u lava ku hoxa Boomerang leswaku yi tlhela yi vuya evokweni ra wena tirhisa leyi endliweke kahle."" which translates to ""When you want to throw a Boomerang so that it always returns to you, use one that is well made.""
* It also mentions that early Boomerangs in Australia didn't return.  The passage implies that *proper technique* is necessary for the boomerang to return, and the correct throw *results in it returning to you*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xi toloveleke ngopfu eka vaaki ku tlula vaendzi** - The passage doesn't mention Boomerangs being dangerous to people.
* **C: Ku hava ti-boomerang to tala eka vanhu va le Australia** - This is simply a historical fact mentioned in the passage, not a result of experimenting with throwing them.
* **D: I ti-boomerang tin’wana leti kotaka ku tlhelela eka wena** - This contradicts the purpose of throwing a Boomerang.  The goal is for it to *return* to the thrower.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi tirhisiwaka swinene eka swakudya swa le Javanese?,"The correct answer is **C: Chukele ra khokhonati**.

The text states: ""...leswi randziwaka ngopfu i timanga, biriviri, **chukele (ngopfungopfu chukele ra maJavanese ra khokhonati)** ni swipayisisi leswi nuhelaka kahle.""  This directly translates to ""...most commonly are rice, fish, **sweet potato (Javanese sweet potato)** and well-cooked vegetables.""  The key phrase is ""chukele ra khokhonati,"" meaning sweet potato made with coconut.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana vuvabyi lebyi tlulelaka byi hangalaka njhani?","The correct answer is **A: Vanhu lava tluletiweke**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leswi swi ya hi leswaku munhu u endzela etikweni rihi kumbe u kunguhata ku endza kwini."" This translates to: ""This is because a person is exposed to a certain environment or goes to a certain place.""  The passage then goes on to explain that exposure to infected people is a key factor in the spread of the disease. Therefore, the disease spreads *to people*.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tipathojini (Pathogens):** Pathogens are the *cause* of the disease (viruses, bacteria, etc.), not who is infected.
* **C: Bakhtheriya (Bacteria):** Bacteria are one type of pathogen, but the question asks about *who* is infected.
* **D: Ku tlhava nsawutiso (Exposure to infection):** While exposure is *necessary*, it's not the answer to *what* spreads. The disease spreads to people.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi hikuya hi vutivi xi nga vangeliki vuvabyi lebyi tlulelaka?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tlhava nsawutiso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mifumo ya matiko yo tala yi lava leswaku vanhu lava endzaka, kumbe lava endzelaka matiko man’wana va tlhava nsawutiso wa mavabyi yo hambanahambana."" This translates to: ""The early symptoms require that people who are sick, or who undergo certain procedures, have a mixture of various pathogens.""

While viruses, bacteria, and fungi *are* pathogens, the passage links the *cause* of the pathogens (the mixture of different ones) to having an immune response. The question asks what *causes* the pathogens, and the answer according to the text is a mixture of them, which leads to the body's immune response. Options B, C, and D are specific types of pathogens, not the underlying reason for the *mixture* of pathogens.



"
Xana hi le ka xiyimo xihi laha ku hlawula purokizi ta web ematshan’weni ya vanyiketi va ti VPN ya munhu swi nga ringanelaka mutirhisi?,"The correct answer is **A: Mutirhisi u lava ku fambisa hinkwako ku kwetlembetana ka inthanete**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what a user needs to do to successfully use a VPN.** The text states that using a VPN effectively relies on a good internet connection and fast servers. This translates directly to the user needing to ""fambisa hinkwako ku kwetlembetana ka inthanethe"" (establish a connection to the internet).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Mutirhisi u vilerisiwa hi ku siveriwa hi nawu ni kumisisa rungula leri tumbetiweke** (The user is hindered by being blocked and having prohibited content blocked) - While VPNs can bypass blocks, this isn't a *requirement* for successful use, it's a *result* of using one.
* **C: Mutirhisi ngopfungopfu u fambisa ku kwetlembetana ka inthanethe** (The user mostly establishes a connection to the internet) - This isn't accurate. The user doesn't *mostly* do anything, they need to do it *successfully* to use the VPN.
* **D: Mutirhisi u lava bandwith ya xiyimo xa le xikarhi ku ya ehenhla** (The user needs mid-range bandwidth to go up) - While mid-range bandwidth is *helpful*, the text doesn't specify a *minimum* requirement, just that a good connection is necessary.  ""Xiyimo xa le xikarhi ku ya ehenhla"" is also a bit vague and doesn't directly address the core need for an internet connection.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi ti-VPN ni ti purokizi ta web","The correct answer is **C: Tipurokizi ta web ti ni ntikelo wa le hansi wa vukorhokeri loko ti pimanisiwa na ti-VPN**.

Here's why:

The passage states that VPNs encrypt internet traffic, making it difficult to analyze.  Therefore, the passage implies that when VPNs are used, web proxies face challenges in analyzing the traffic. This means proxies have a *lower level of visibility* (ntikelo wa le hansi wa vukorhokeri) into the data.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hi ku kongoma ti-VPN ti nyika bandwith leyikulu ku tlula tipurokizi** - The passage doesn't mention VPNs increasing bandwidth. In fact, encryption typically *slightly* reduces bandwidth.
* **B: Tipurokizi ta web a ti koti ku fambisa nkwetlembetano hinkwawo ta inthanete** - This is generally true of web proxies, but the passage's main point isn't about proxies generally functioning; it's about how they're *affected* by VPNs.
* **D: Ti-VPN ti kota ku fambisa nkwetlembetano wa inthanete hi http ntsena** -  VPNs typically use various protocols (like HTTPS) for encryption, not just HTTP. The passage states encryption is the key factor.



"
I yini lexi pfumelelaka munhu ku tirhisa foyini ya khamphani ehandle ka ndhawu leyi a tshamaka eka yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku foyina hi ku tirhisa inthanete**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tanihi leswi ku foyiniwaka hi Inthaneti, a ku laveki leswaku u tirhisa foyini ya khamphani leyi kumekaka eka ndhawu leyi u tshamaka eka yona kumbe u yi vhakelaka.""  This translates to: ""With calls made over the Internet, it is not necessary to use a company's phone located in the place where you live or where you are located.""  This directly explains how one can use a company's phone service regardless of location - through internet calling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tinomboro ta foyini ta misava (International phone numbers):** While international numbers *were* relevant in the past, the passage focuses on the shift to internet calling, making this less of a primary reason now.
* **C: Tisethalayiti (ISPs):**  ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are necessary for internet calling, but they are the *means* by which internet calling is possible, not the fundamental reason *why* one can use a company's phone service remotely.
* **D: Tifoyini ta PSTN (PSTN phones):** PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) phones are the traditional, landline phones, and the passage discusses the *move away* from them towards internet calling.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga lavaka ku endliwa leswaku u amukela tifoyini tin’wana?","The correct answer is **A: Ku xava nomboro ya misava (Dialing the country code)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that when calling internationally, you need to use the country code (the ""misava"" number). This is because phone numbers are tied to specific geographic locations and phone networks.  You need to dial the country code *before* the local phone number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku tirhisa khamphani ya tifoyini ta laha u tshamaka kona (Using a local phone company):** While using a local phone company *can* be an option, it's not the fundamental requirement for making international calls.  You still need to dial the country code first.
*   **C: Ku kuma nomboro ya le mugangeni wa ka n’wina (Finding the number of the recipient's phone):** Knowing the recipient's number is important, but it doesn't address the need to use the country code.
*   **D: Ku xava foyini ya PSTN (Dialing a PSTN phone):** PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is the traditional phone network. While you might be dialing a PSTN phone, the issue isn't *just* about the PSTN, it's about the international calling process, which requires country codes.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma ku vitaniwa ka marito ya Xintariyani?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku vitaniwa ka marito yo tala ka hambana hikuya hi xitwari lexi landzelaka.**

Here's why:

* The question asks what principle governs the pronunciation of the first ""r"" in Xhosa words. The text states that the pronunciation of the first ""r"" depends on the following vowel.
* The text provides examples:
    * ""caro"" (car) has a different pronunciation than ""carro"" (goats).
* This demonstrates that the pronunciation of the first ""r"" is *not* consistent across all words. It *varies* based on the subsequent vowel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti r timbirhi ti vitaniwa hilaha ku hambaneke na r yin’we** (The two ""r"" sounds are called different from the other). While there are different ""r"" sounds, this doesn't explain *how* they are differentiated.
* **B: Marito yo tala ma vitaniwa hilaha ma tsariwaka hakona** (The first words are called according to how they are pronounced).  Pronunciation isn't the determining factor; it's the vowel *following* the first ""r"".
* **C: Marito lama nga letere c na g ma nonon’hwa** (Words with the letters c and g are mumbled). This is inaccurate and not supported by the text. The letters 'c' and 'g' are used in various ways within the language, and their presence doesn't dictate the pronunciation of the first 'r'.



"
Eka swihlawulekisi leswi landzelaka swa Izmir hi xihi lexi sunguleke emahlweni ka nkarhi wa ximodeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti boulevard leti anameke (The wide boulevards)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti boulevards leti anameke, miako yo vekiwa ngilazi emahlweni na tindhawu ta mavhengele ta ximodeni ti fuleriwe hi thayilese-to tshuka ta ndhavuko..."" (The wide boulevards, the buildings built with glass facades, and the modern shopping areas are filled with traditional colored tiles...). This indicates that the wide boulevards are a prominent feature that has been renovated and is a key aspect of Izmir's transformation.

The other options are elements *found* on the boulevards, but not the initial feature highlighted as being renovated.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xihlawulekisi xa Izmir?,"The correct answer is **C: U nga kuma tindhawu ta mavhengele ta ximodeni ni tikereke ta khale**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...ti boulevards leti anameke, miako yo vekiwa ngilazi emahlweni na tindhawu ta mavhengele ta ximodeni ti fuleriwe hi thayilese-to tshuka ta ndhavuko, makete wa lembe xidzana ra vu 18, na tindhawu ta khale ta vukhongeri ni tikereke...""  This directly points to the presence of historical and religious sites.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Doroba ri rhendzela ndhawu leyikulu ya swikepe:** While the passage mentions Izmir's strategic port location, it doesn't highlight this as a *lack* of something. It's presented as a positive attribute.
* **B: Xiyimo xa kona xi kombisa Turkey ya ndhavuko:**  The passage states Izmir has a blend of Mediterranean European and Turkish influences. It doesn't focus on it *not* representing traditional Turkey.
* **D: Ku ni ndhawu ya swikepe ya vumbirhi hi vukulu eTurkey:** The passage mentions Izmir's port, but it doesn't state that Turkey lacks large port cities. It's about the specific features of Izmir.



"
Rito hanami ri vula ku vona yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku rhumbuka ka cherry**.

The text explicitly states: ""Rito hanami ri vula ku vona **ku rhumbuka ka cherry**..."" which translates to ""The name hanami means to see **cherry blossoms**...""
"
I mani loyi a rhurheleke swinkhubyana swo sungula leswi a swi endleriwa ku vona ku rhumbuka ka ti-cherry?,"The correct answer is **C: Mufumi wa Japani**.

The text states: ""EJapan, mintlango yo sungula ya ku rhumbuka ka cherry a yi khomiwa hi mulawuri ntsena na van’wana va le vuhosini kusuhi na Imperial Court."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the first traditions of cherry blossom viewing were initiated by the emperor and others in the nobility and the Imperial Court.""

Therefore, the emperor (mufumi) of Japan was the one who initiated the first traditions related to cherry blossom viewing.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swilo leswi landzelaka xa Yerusalema hi xihi lexi nga taka xi nga tsakisi ngopfu vapfhumba?","The best answer is **A: Nkoka wa vukhongeri edorobeni (The importance of the city's religious significance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily emphasizes Yerusalem's religious importance.** It explicitly states it's a center for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and a spiritual, leadership, and cultural hub. The text mentions its ancient history and significance to various faiths.
* **The passage touches on other aspects, but religion is the central theme.** While the city's status as Israel's capital, cultural heritage, and historical sites are mentioned, they are framed *within the context of its religious importance*.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Xiyimo xa yona tanihi dorobankulu ra Israel (Its status as the capital of Israel):** While important, the passage doesn't dedicate significant space to discussing the political implications of being the capital. Its religious significance is portrayed as a more enduring and foundational aspect.
* **C: Swilo swa ndhavuko (Cultural heritage):** The passage mentions cultural heritage, but it's tied to the historical and religious development of the city.  Religion is the driving force *behind* much of the cultural heritage.
* **D: Tindhawu to tala ta matimu (Ancient religious sites):**  This is a component of the religious significance, but not the encompassing reason why the city is important to so many people. It's *because of* the religious sites that the city holds this importance.



Therefore, the passage points to the **religious importance** as the core element that makes Jerusalem so significant and enduring, even amidst ongoing challenges.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi nchumu lowu Yerusalema ri tiviwaka ha wona?,"The correct answer is **B: Nkucetelo wa politiki**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions that Jerusalem is a city of immense religious, spiritual, and cultural significance for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It also states that the Old City contains sites that have attracted pilgrims for centuries. 

The question asks what has ""boxed in"" Jerusalem. While the passage mentions historical sites (A), religious significance (C), and cultural attractions (D), the overarching reason for the city's complex and often tense situation is **political**.  The conflict over Jerusalem's control is a long-standing and deeply rooted political issue.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mupfhumba wa muxaka loyi a nga taka a nga pfuneki hi ku xava Wild Card?","The correct answer is **C: Mupfhumba loyi a xiyisisaka tihakelo ta phaki**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ku pfuna loko munhu a xava Wild Card, leri ri endlaka a kota ku nghena eka phaki leti hlawuriweke ta le Afrika Dzonga kumbe a kota ku nghena eka tiphaki hinkwato ta South African National Parks."" This means the Wild Card allows entry into *both* African Parks and SANParks.
* **The question asks:** ""Mupfhumba wa muxaka loyi a nga taka a nga pfuneki hi ku xava Wild Card?""  This asks what kind of person *wouldn't* be eligible.
* **Option C (Mupfhumba loyi a xiyisisaka tihakelo ta phaki) - ""A person who damages park property""** is the only option that would disqualify someone from using the Wild Card. Damage to park property is a violation of park rules and would likely lead to the revocation of access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mupfhumba loyi a hlelaka ku endzela ti-SANPark to tala hilaha swi kotekaka hakona?** - This is about someone who tries to avoid paying entrance fees. The Wild Card *allows* access, so this isn't a disqualifying factor.
* **B: Mupfhumba loyi a endzelaka Kruger National Park ntsena** - Simply visiting Kruger National Park doesn't disqualify someone from using a Wild Card.
* **D: Mupfhumba loyi a hlelaka ku endzela Kruger National Park ni phaki yin’wana** - This is too broad. While someone who tries to exploit both Kruger and other parks might face consequences, it's not as clear a disqualifier as damaging park property.



"
Hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga yi hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku ni swiharhi swo hambanahambana hikuya hi tindhawu**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...ndhawu yin’wana na yin’wana yi seketela swiharhi swo hambana."" (each area has different wildlife).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi tekiwa tanihi ndhawu leyi rhandziwaka eAfrika Dzonga** - While Kruger is well-known, the passage doesn't *explicitly* say it's the *most* popular.  It states it's a significant park.
* **C: Hi yona leyitsongo eka ti-National Park ta Afrika Dzonga** - The passage doesn't claim Kruger is the *only* or *most* important national park in Africa.
* **D: Yi nga fikeleriwa hi vapfhumba hi ku tirhisa Wild Card** - While the passage *does* mention the Wild Card, it's about *how* people can access the park, not what's specifically *revealed* about the park itself through its management.



Therefore, option B is the only statement directly supported by the text.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga vangaka ngopfu khombo eka vakhandziyi eka swiyenge leswi tlhandlukaka swinene swa ntshava?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindhawu to tsakama (Steep slopes)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku nga va ni nghozi ngopfungopfu loko ku tsakama."" which translates to ""It is very dangerous when it's steep.""  The text describes Machu Picchu as having steep slopes as a significant challenge for visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Maribye yo khandziyeka (Broken paths):** While broken paths are mentioned, the danger of steep slopes is emphasized more strongly.
* **C: Mabakwa yo khuma (Falling rocks):**  While a risk, falling rocks are not presented as the primary danger mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Tinsimbi to khomelela eka tona (Metal railings):** Metal railings are a safety feature, not a danger.

Therefore, steep slopes are the most prominent and explicitly stated danger for visitors to Machu Picchu in the provided text.



"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma xiganga xa ntshava ya Machu Picchu lexi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi?,"The correct answer is **D: Swiyenge leswi tlhandlukaka ngopfu swi ni khombo loko ku tsakama.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hilaha swi vuriweke hakona, langutela ku hefemuteka, loko u kandziya exigangeni, kambe ku nga va ni nghozi ngopfungopfu loko ku tsakama."" This translates to ""Although it is said that it is possible to explore, there is a high risk when it rains.""

Then, it describes the dangers of the terrain: ""Ku ni mabakwa lawa u faneleke u hundza eka wona loko u ri ekusuhi ni le henhlahenhla ka tshava, wona ma le hansi kambe u fanele u manyukuta.""  This translates to ""There are dangers that you should be aware of when it is dry and uphill, both above and below, but you should climb.""

Finally, the passage says: ""Swiyenge leswi tlhandlukaka ngopfu swi ni khombo loko ku tsakama."" which translates to ""The steep slopes are dangerous when it rains.""

Therefore, option D directly reflects a key danger highlighted in the passage – the danger of steep slopes during rainfall.  The other options are either not mentioned or are not the *primary* concern emphasized in the text.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi i yini lexi nga riki swakudya leswi tolovelekeke swa Majorcan?","The correct answer is **D: Matsavu**.

The text states that Majorcan cuisine uses pork, fish, and poultry, but *not* mushrooms. 

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
"Hikuya hi rungula leri nga eka xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi swakudya leswi vuriwaka hangi?","The correct answer is **D: Hangi ya ku hisa loku humaka endzeni ya kumeka eRotorua.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Etindhawini to tala ta le Rotorua hangi yi swekiwa hi ku hisa loku humaka endzeni ka misava..."" (In the early days of Rotorua, hangi was cooked by burying it in the earth...).
* Option D accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hangi ya ku hisa loku humaka endzeni yi tirhisa maribye ya le xitikweni leswaku ku hisisiwa khele:** While burying is part of the process, the passage doesn't mention specific tools.
* **B: Hangi leyi tirhisaka maribye yo hisa ya kumeka eWellington:** The passage states hangi cooked by burying is more common in Rotorua.
* **C: Swakudya swo lalela swo katingiwa swi swekiwa hi hangi:** The passage clarifies that hangi is a traditional food and not typically cooked with ""swakudya swo lalela"" (sleeping food).



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki tanihi ndlela ya ntolovelo yo hisisa khele ra hangi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku hisa loku humaka endzeni**.

The text states: ""Etindhawini to tala ta le Rotorua hangi yi swekiwa hi ku hisa loku humaka endzeni ka misava..."" which translates to ""In the past, in Rotorua, hangi was cooked by burying it in the ground...""  This directly refers to the method of cooking.

While maribye yo hisa (hot stones) are used in the process, the *method* of cooking is the burying in the ground, which is ""ku hisa loku humaka endzeni"" (burying/hiding something inside).
"
I yini lexi nga vangelaka ku xiyiwa hi ndlela yo hlawulaka eka monk kumbe nun?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku ambala xifunengeto xa muvala wo vangama**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""To tala ta tiyindlu ta ti monk ti na swo funengeta swa vavasati lava taka va nga lunghekanga, kambe loko u te na xa wena, ngopfu ngopfu lexi nga na mivala yo vonaka ngopfu, u ta kuma ku nwayitela ku suka eka monk kumbe nun enyangwheni."" This translates to: ""Generally, the accommodation of monks has inadequate facilities for those who cannot be cured, but if you see something that has a noticeable odor, you will usually smell something coming from the monk or nun in the refectory.""  The key phrase is ""mivala yo vonaka ngopfu"" - a noticeable odor.  The passage also mentions that the odor is linked to the color of the undergarments.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku funengeta makatla:** While inadequate facilities are mentioned, the passage focuses on the *odor* associated with the undergarments, not just the lack of facilities.
*   **C: Ku lomba xo tifunengeto eka monasitiri:** This is irrelevant to the reason for the odor.
*   **D: Ku ambala xiketi lexi fikaka ehenhla ka matsolo:** The passage links odor to the color of the undergarments, *not* the color of the robes.



"
Eka swiambalo leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi kumeki ku xi lomba eka monasitiri? ,"The correct answer is **C: Maburuku**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hilaha ku fanaka, vavanuna va fanele va mbala maburuku lama pfalaka matsolo."" (Similarly, monks should wear clothes of brown color that are patched.)  The other options are mentioned as things that *can* be found in a monastery, but not specifically linked to causing something to be washed.
"
Xana hi rini laha muendzi a nga vaka ni nkarhi wo tala wa languta tinyeleti loko a endzela tindhawu ta le Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **A: Hi tin’hweti ta ximumu (During the winter months)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tanihi leswi vanhu va nga tshami ku suhi ni ku suhi, ku toloveleke leswaku ku layita loku endliweke hi munhu ku nga vi ni swiphiqo, naswona u ta swikota ku tsakela tinyeleti.""  This translates to ""...many people cannot live and sleep there, it is likely that the light produced by humans will not be enough, so one will seek sunlight.""

This indicates that sunlight is scarce in the Arctic and Antarctic during certain times.  The winter months are when these regions experience the longest periods of darkness, making it the time when people are most likely to seek sunlight and experience the polar night.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Loko ndhawu yi nga talanga hi vanhu (When the place is not inhabited):**  While uninhabited places might have better views of the aurora, the question is about sunlight.  Sunlight availability isn't directly related to human presence.
*   **C: Hi tin’hweti ta xixika (During the short months):** This is incorrect because the Arctic and Antarctic have *very* short daylight months, particularly in winter.
*   **D: Loko mpimo wa timboni wu nga ri ehenhla (When the snow cover is high):** Snow cover doesn't directly determine sunlight availability. It can even *reflect* sunlight, but it doesn't make the days longer.



"
Xana hi rini laha foyini ya sethalayiti yi nga taka yi nga sivi selifoni?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko ndlela ya sethalayiti yo tshuka yi siveriwa** (When the network signal is weak).

Here's why:

* The passage states that satellite internet relies on a strong signal. A weak or disrupted signal (like a weak network) is the most common reason for connectivity issues.
* Options B, C, and D are less directly related to the fundamental requirements of satellite internet.  While they *could* contribute to problems, a weak signal is the primary cause.



"
Xana hi rini laha foyini ya sethalayiti yi nga antswaka ku tlula selifoni?,"The correct answer is **A: Loko u endzele edorobeni (When you are in a city)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Foyini ya sethalayiti a yi tirhiseriwa ku teka ndhawu ya riqhingho, tanihi leswi u fanelkee u va ehandle naswona eka ndhawu leyi sethalayiti yi vonaka kahle leswaku u kota ku foyina."" This translates to: ""Cell tower signal is used to take over the network, including things you need to deal with in a place where the cell tower is visible and you can signal well.""

Cities generally have a higher density of cell towers than rural areas. Therefore, signal strength is typically better in urban environments.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Hi nkarhi wa riendzo ra xikepe (During a team meeting):** This is not directly related to signal strength.
* **C: Loko ku nga laveki data ya le tlhelo (When you can't get the latest data):**  Lack of data could be due to many things, not just signal strength.
* **D: Loko u ta kota ku amukela netiweke leyinene ya selifoni (When you can receive a strong phone network):** This is the *opposite* of when signal strength is weak.

Ku simekiwa ka Transnistria Republic ku vangiwe hi lwetana hi yini eka leswi landzelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ikhonomi**.

The passage states: ""Ikhonomi swi tlhele swi endliwa eka swiyenge leswimbirhi swa Moldova ku nga khathariseki ku tsandzeka ku twanana eka minkanelo ya swa politiki.""  This translates to: ""Economic disputes have consistently been at the heart of the conflict between Moldova and Transnistria, hindering the development of political relations.""

While other factors like ethnicity, language, and religion are mentioned as features of Moldova, the passage specifically links economic disputes to the establishment and ongoing issues surrounding Transnistria.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi Rhiphabuliki Ya Transnistria yi nga na xona lexi hambaneke na Moldova hinkwayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku amukeriwa hi UN**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...Rhiphabuliki Ya Transnistria yi nga na mfumo wa yona n’wini na mali kambe a ri tiveki eka matiko hinkwawo lama nga swirho swa UN."" This directly indicates that Transnistria is not recognized by the UN.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ririmi (Language):** While the passage mentions that the languages spoken in Moldova are related to Romanian and Russian, it doesn't state that language is a key differentiating factor between Moldova and Transnistria.
* **B: Vukhongeri (Religion):** The passage mentions that the dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity, but it doesn't say Transnistria has a different religion.
* **D: Muxaka wa mali (Currency):** The passage mentions that Transnistria has its own money, but the lack of UN recognition is highlighted as a significant difference.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi rini laha muendzi a faneleke ku endzela Montevideo loko a lava ku papalata mimoya?","The correct answer is **A: Hi tin’hweti ta xixika ta Northern Hemisphere**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Montevideo is located in the subtropics and experiences very little temperature variation. However, it gets very hot during the summer in the Northern Hemisphere. This suggests that the heat from the Northern Hemisphere is the reason for the warm weather in Montevideo during *their* summer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hi nkarhi wo pfumala mpfula le Montevideo:** The passage explicitly states there are no distinct rainy or dry seasons in Montevideo.
*   **C: Hi tin’hweti ta ximumu xa Northern Hemisphere:** While the Northern Hemisphere's winter might have a *slight* effect, the passage emphasizes the extreme heat during *their* summer.
*   **D: Hi tin’hweti ta xixika ta Montevideo:** The passage indicates a lack of significant temperature variation *within* Montevideo's year, meaning local weather patterns aren't the primary factor for changes in temperature related to wind.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi rini laha muendzi a faneleke ku endzela Montevideo loko a nga ma rhandzi ngopfu maxelo yo hola?","The correct answer is **A: Loko ku ri ximumu le Montevideo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi xixika ka titimela swinene: maxelo wolowo a swi talanga ma cinca, kambe moya na mberha swi endla leswaku ku ya ku titimela ku tlula hilaha ku vuriweke hakona.""  This means that although the maximum temperatures don't change much, the weather can be *very* hot in Montevideo.  The question asks when someone might need to protect themselves from the heat, *even if they don't like high temperatures*.  This is directly linked to the general climate of Montevideo itself, which is described as being very hot despite not having extreme temperature swings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Loko ku ri ximumu le Northern Hemisphere:** While Montevideo *is* in the Northern Hemisphere, this isn't the primary reason someone would need protection from the heat.  It's a geographic fact, not a climatic one.
* **C: Loko ku ri nguva ya mpfula le Montevideo:** The passage explicitly says there's no rainy season or dry season – the rainfall is evenly distributed. Therefore, rain isn't the factor causing the heat.
* **D: Loko ku ri xixika le Northern Hemisphere:** This is redundant and doesn't answer the question. It just restates a geographic fact.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga fambisanaka ni loyi a mpfampfarhutaka emakhumbini leswi vitaniwaka girafiti, ku hambana ni ku onha nhundzu?","The correct answer is **A: Swiendlakalo swa girafiti (Graffiti phenomena)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Hambileswi swi nga faniki na leswi endliwaka masiku lawa kambe vanhu vo tala va ehleketa leswaku swi endliwe hi vantshwa hi xikongomelo xo onha nhundzu."" (Things that seem strange and are done these days, ancient people used to laugh at thinking they were done by creatures that have a strong scent.) This indicates that graffiti is a phenomenon being discussed.
* **The passage further explains:** ""Hambiswiritano, masiku lawa ku ni vampfampfarhuti va tigirafiti va le nawini, mintlangu yo mpfampfarhuta ni makhumbi lawa va pfumeleriwaka ku mpfampfarhuta eka wona. Mipfampfarhuto leyi ku vulavuriwaka ha yona laha i swifaniso ku nga ri marito lama tsariweke hi pende."" (Furthermore, these days there are graffiti artists, spray paint, and walls that are allowed to be sprayed on. The talked-about phenomenon is the images that seem to be made with very dense paint.)  This confirms that graffiti is the main topic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku halahala (Chaos)** - While graffiti *can* appear chaotic, the passage focuses on the phenomenon itself, not just its visual appearance.
* **C: Swifaniso leswi laviwiki emiakweni ya rixaka (Strange images in mythological cultures)** -  The passage mentions ancient people finding graffiti strange *as if* it was made by mythical creatures, but it doesn't suggest a connection to mythological imagery itself.
* **D: Switsariwa leswi nga faneriki (Unusual markings)** - While graffiti is a type of marking, ""swiendlakalo swa girafiti"" is a more comprehensive and accurate description of the topic being discussed.

Hi swihi swiphemu swa minkhuvo ya vuyimbeleri leswi van’wana va swi tekaka swi ri swa nkoka eku tiphineni ka vona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku ndzima matende**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""vunyingi bya lava teke eka minkhuvo ya vuyimbeleri va hlawula ku dzima matende endhawini yoleyo naswona vo tala va swi teka ku ri nchumu wa nkoka eka xiendlakalo xexo.""  This translates to: ""Many people who have been affected by ancestral spirits have found it necessary to burn incense in that place, and those who first saw them considered it an important ritual for the situation.""

The question asks what ancestral spirits considered necessary for their protection. The passage explicitly says they considered **burning incense (ku ndzima matende)** to be an important ritual.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku famba ni vana va wena (Traveling with your children)** While travel might be involved in rituals, the passage doesn't highlight this as the *essential* protection.
*   **C: Ku tlangiwa ka vuyimbeleri ku ya fika ni vusiku (The spirits coming at night)**  The passage implies the spirits might come at night, but doesn't state this is the *protective* ritual.  It's more of a description of their behavior.
*   **D: Ku hatla u fika (Coming to find out)** This is not related to protective rituals."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana loyi a yaka enkhubyeni lowu u faneleke ku rhangisa yini emahlweni loko a lava ku dzima tende ekusuhi ni vuyimbeleri?","The correct answer is **D: Ku hatla u fika**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loko u lava ku swi vonela ekusuhi, u fanele u hatla u fika u ta kuma ndhawu yo dzima ka yona tende leyi nga ekusuhi ni ntlawa wa vayimbeleri."" (When you want to see them dry, you should go and find the place where the dry dung is and the remains of the elders.)

This directly translates to ""You should go and find the place."" Option D, ""Ku hatla u fika"" (To go), is the closest and most accurate reflection of this instruction.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi kwihi laha vaendzi va fanele va ku papalata loko lava ku tihungasa ni vusiku le New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Etibarheni letitsongo edorobeni (Bars in the downtown area)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tibara leti kumekaka emadorobeni lamatsongo a ti hlayisekanga eka vaendzi."" (Bars that are located in the downtown areas are not considered safe for visitors.)
* It also mentions casinos and the late-night entertainment in Albuquerque and Santa Fe, but focuses the safety concern specifically on downtown bars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pueblos:** The passage doesn't mention pueblos as places where visitors should be cautious.
* **C: Tindhawu ta mavhengele (Ventura Spots):** This option isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Tikhasino (Casinos):** While casinos are mentioned, the passage doesn't explicitly state they are unsafe; it focuses on bars in the downtown area.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana hi kwihi laha muendzi a nga tshuka a kuma vuhungasi lebyi dumeke le New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: Ekhasino ya le kusuhi na Sante-Fe**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...tikhasino hinkwato leti xaxametiweke laha, ta xavisa swakunwa, tin’wana ti hungasa vahlaleri hi xikongomelo xo navetisa (ngopfungopfu letikulu leti nga ekusuhi na doroba ra Albuquerque ni ra Santa Fe)."" This translates to ""...these legalized casinos offer alcohol, and other attractions entertain guests with entertainment (large casinos in Albuquerque and Santa Fe).""

Options A and B are not mentioned in the text. Option D is ruled out because the text says bars in ""unsanctioned"" locations are not reliable.
"
Vapfhumba lava xiyisisaka ku tirhisa ka vona mali va nga papalata swonwa swihi?,"The correct answer is **C: Byala bya ndhawu (Local fruits)**.

The text states: ""Mati ya le mpompini ya kwalaho ma basile swinene lerova ma nga nwiwa kambe lama nga eka mabodlhela ma kumeka hi ku olova loko u chava ku nwa ya le mpompini. Eka vanhu va le Australia, khofi leyi cheriwaka meleke wutsongo va yi teka yi ri ya le ntsungeni."" This implies that Australian coffee is made with local fruits. The rest of the text discusses coffee, hot chocolate and desserts.
"
"Hi ku landza ndhawu leyi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi, hi tihi tiodara ta swonwa leti nga tshukaka ti kanganyisa muphameri?","The correct answer is **A: Short black**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes ""Number One"" as a popular coffee type that is always ""phyuphyisa"" (presumably meaning strong or intense).  
* It mentions that in Australia, coffee with a very strong, espresso-like taste is popular.
* ""Short black"" is a very strong coffee, essentially espresso served in a small cup.  It fits the description of being strong and popular in a place like Australia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Number One:** While mentioned, it's just a name for a type of coffee, not a specific drink.
* **C: Sauvignon Blanc ya le New Zealand:** This is a type of wine, not coffee.
* **D: Leswi vuriwaka flat white:** Flat white is mentioned, but the passage says cappuccino is topped with foam, and flat white is served without. It's not as strongly associated with the description of a strong coffee as ""Short black"".



"
"Nguva ya vukoloni yi sunguriwe hi ntlawa wihi, leyi tekeke malembe xidzana manharhu?","The correct answer is **D: Vaaki va Spain**.

The passage states: ""Ku sukela loko ku ve na dorobankulu ra Asunción hi 1537, tiko Paraguay ri sungule ku tiendlela swa rona ni ku hlayisa ndhavuko wa rona."" This indicates that the colonization by the Spanish (Vaaki va Spain) began in 1537 and lasted for centuries.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndlela leyinene yo kota ku tsakeriwa hi Vaperesiya?","The correct answer is **D: Ku va ni matikhomelo yo pfumala nhlonipho**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Hambileswi hakanyingi leswi i mavonelo ya vanhu lama nga riki ntiyiso, ndlela ya kahle yo famba famba eParis i ku tikhoma kahle, u tikhoma tanihi munhu loyi a nga """"bien élevé"""" (la kurisiweke kahle). Swi ta endla leswaku ku famba famba ka wena ku olova. Ku pfumala nhlonipho ka Vaperesiya ku hatla ku haha loko u va komba vumunhu.""

Translation: ""Avoid excessively showing off; the best way to walk in Paris is to walk well, like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-bred). It will make your walk elegant. Getting respect from Parisians is difficult if you show off.""

The key takeaway is that getting respect (and thus being well-regarded by Parisians, which is implied by the context of Vaperesiya) involves *showing respect* – which is what ""ku va ni matikhomelo yo pfumala nhlonipho"" (having manners that earn respect) means.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku ringeta ku tekelela langutelo ra vona** (To take their opinions lightly) - The text suggests the opposite; respecting their customs is important.
* **B: Ku kombisa ku titshemba** (To show arrogance) - The text explicitly warns against showing off.
* **C: Ku endla hi moya wo rhula** (To act calmly) - While acting calmly might be helpful, the text focuses on *manners* and *respect*.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tekiwiki tanihi ndhuma yo tianakanya ya Vaperesiya?","The correct answer is **A: Nkanu**.

The passage states: ""Vaperesiya va na ndhuma yo tianakanyela va ri voxe, **yo pfumala nhlonipho ni yo va ni nkanu.**"" This translates to: ""Vaperesiya are generally considered to have a sophisticated air, and **to be elegant and refined**.""  Therefore, ""nkanu"" (elegance/refinement) is listed as a characteristic of Vaperesiya. While the passage mentions respect, it also explicitly states elegance and refinement.
"
Hi byihi vuyelo bya Tlilasi yo Sungula eka MetroRail ya le Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: A ti talelanga hi vanhu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""MetroPlus ya tsakisa ende a yi talelanga hi vanhu..."" which translates to ""MetroPlus is slow and does not transport many people...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Torokosi ra kona ra le mahlweni ka xitimela:** While true that MetroPlus trains have front carriages, this isn't the main reason why it's considered a failure.
* **C: A ri durhi ngopfu ku fana ni thikithi ra Tlilasi ya Vunharhu:** The passage doesn't mention the price of MetroPlus tickets compared to Metro tickets.
* **D: Ntsengo wa rona wu fana ni thikithi ra Metro:** Similar to option C, the passage doesn't discuss pricing.

Therefore, the only correct answer directly supported by the text is that MetroPlus doesn't transport many people.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi lexi xitimela xin’wana ni xin’wana xa vakhandziyi xi nga na xona le Cape Town?","The correct answer is **D: Matorokisi ya tlilasi yo Sungula ni ya Vumbirhi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Matorokisi ya MetroPlus ma le makumu ka xitimela. Xitimela xin’wana ni xin’wana xi na matorokisi ya MetroPlus ni ya Metro;"" which translates to ""MetroPlus cars and train carriages. Other trains have MetroPlus and Metro cars;""  This directly indicates that the trains share carriages from both MetroPlus and Metro.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i ini lexi xifuwo xi nga tshukaka xi nga xi endli?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku vangela swirhumbana (Causes diarrhea)**.

Here's why:

The question describes unsafe foods that can cause:

*   Spoilage (making food rotten)
*   Allergies
*   Stomach upset/vomiting
*   Food poisoning

Out of the choices provided, diarrhea (swirhumbana) is a common and direct consequence of consuming spoiled or contaminated food, aligning with the descriptions in the question.  While other options *could* be possible, diarrhea is the most directly and commonly associated adverse reaction with food safety issues.



"
Xana makhadi ya tifoyini lama hakeleriwaka ma nga xaviwa kwihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Eka tifoyini to hakeleriwa (On the phones being locked)**.

The text states: ""Xitolo xin’wana ni xin’wana xi tele hi makhadi ya tifoyini lama hakeleriwaka lama nga tirhisiwaka eka ti foyini leti u hakelaka kumbe ti foyini tale kaya."" This translates to: ""One card is removed from one card, which is used on locked phones or phones taken home.""  This implies the cards are *on* the locked phones.
"
Xana mitsengo leyi antswaka yo foyini yi kotisa ku yini ku nyikeriwa hi makhadi man’wana lama tirhisiwaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Hi ku tirhisa foyini yo hakeleriwa ni ku hakela ntsengo lowu engetelekeke.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Xitolo xa Xitolo ni xin’wana ni xin’wana xi tele hi makhadi ya tifoyini lama hakeleriwaka lama nga tirhisiwaka eka ti foyini leti u hakelaka kumbe ti foyini tale kaya.""  This means the solution involves using pre-paid phone cards.
* **The passage further explains:**  ""... loko u foyinela matiko man’wana."" (when you call different numbers). This implies using a phone card allows for calling various numbers without incurring high charges.
* **The question asks:** ""Xana mitsengo leyi antswaka yo foyini yi kotisa ku yini ku nyikeriwa hi makhadi man’wana lama tirhisiwaka?"" (Does the low cost of phone calls encourage the use of more phone cards?).
* **Option D directly addresses this:**  It connects the affordability of phone calls with the use of pre-paid cards, which in turn are often associated with more flexible or discounted call rates.


Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi nga fikeleriwa ntsena ematikweni yo karhi (It can be calculated in advance):** While phone cards *can* offer some predictability, the passage doesn't highlight this as a primary reason for using them. The main appeal seems to be low cost and flexible calling.
* **B: Hi ku tirhisa tinomboro ta mahala (By using free numbers):**  The passage focuses on phone cards, not free numbers.  Free numbers aren't inherently linked to phone cards.
* **C: Exitolo xa le khoneni (The corner exit):** This option is completely unrelated to the passage and the question.



Therefore, **D** is the only answer that logically connects the low cost of phone calls (facilitated by phone cards) with the increased use of these cards."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka misinya leyi landzelaka hi wihi lowu nga talangiki ephakini ya swiharhi ya Mativa ya Plitvice?","The correct answer is **A: Beech**.

The text states: ""Mativa Ya Plitvice ya tiphaki ta tiko ya na kwhati lerikulu, ngopfu ngopfu hi **beech**, spruce, na misinya ya fir..."" which translates to ""Plitvice Lakes National Park is a mountainous area with a large forest, mostly beech, spruce, and fir forests...""

Therefore, beech is one of the most abundant tree types in the park.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi swihi swimila leswi tolovelekangiki leswi kumekaka ephakini ya swiharhi ya Mativa ya Plitivice?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndhawu leyi I kaya eka swiharhi swa mixaka yo tala ni swinyenyana. **Swiharhi leswi kumekaka endhawini yoleyo swo fana na bere ya le Yuropa, mbyana ya kwhati, gama, xikhovha, lynx, ximanga xa nhova na ti capercaillie swi nga kumeka eka dhawu yoleyo...**""

This directly lists Capercaillie as a species found in the forests of Plitvice Lakes National Park. The other options are not mentioned in the text as being found there."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana tikhowudi ta tindhawu ti pfuna ha yini?","The correct answer is **C: Ku siva piracy**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Entiyisweni, tikhowudi ta ndhawu abyi khumbi ni katsonga ku kopiwa loku ku nga riki nawini; **ku kopa ka diski ka ntsongo ni kantsongo ku ta tlanga kahle eka divayisi yin’wana ni yin’wana leyi pfumalaka diski ya ntiyiso.**""  This means the local studios are trying to *prevent* piracy (illegal copying).  The entire paragraph discusses the problem of piracy and how studios are trying to combat it.  Option C is the closest summary of their goal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku kopiwa ka tidisiki (Copying discs):** While copying discs *is* related to piracy, it's not the *goal* of the studios. They want to *stop* it.
* **B: Ku lawula vuxavi (Controlling distribution):**  While controlling distribution might be a consequence of fighting piracy, it's not the primary focus highlighted in the passage.
* **D: Ku kopa swi nga ri enawini (Copying without permission):** This describes piracy, but option C, ""Ku siva piracy"" is a more direct and accurate way to represent the studios' intent.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga mavunwa hi tikhowudi ta ndhawu lexi vuriwaka hi tikhamphani ta ku vika mahungu?","The correct answer is **C: Ta pfuna eku endleni mali hi ku olova**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that companies are using legal action to generate revenue (""endla mali leyi engeteleleke"").
* The core of this revenue generation is preventing unauthorized copying, essentially protecting their income stream.
* Option C, ""Ta pfuna eku endleni mali hi ku olova"" (They want to make money by being aggressive/intrusive), best encapsulates the aggressive legal tactics companies employ against piracy to protect their financial interests. While not explicitly stated as ""aggressive"" it implies a forceful approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ta laveka leswaku u u lawula vuxavi** (They are trying to control the user experience): While legal action *can* affect user experience, it's not the primary goal.
* **B: Ti pfuna ku papalata ku kopiwa swi nga ri enawini** (They want to prevent unauthorized copying): This is a *description* of what they're doing, not the *motivation*.
* **D: A ti tali hi ku pfuna eka ku siva piracy** (They are claiming to be fighting piracy): The passage implies a more self-serving motivation - making money - rather than purely altruistically ""fighting piracy"". The legal actions are a *means* to an end, not the end itself.



"
"Loko u fika eka tiko ra ka n’wina, hi rihi endlelo leri nga tolovelekangiki?","The correct answer is **D: Ku lawula swilo swo nghena na swona (Controlling what enters)**.

Here's why:

The question describes a situation where someone is being denied entry due to suspicious items or a strong odor. The provided text emphasizes the importance of controlling what enters your home for security.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku kamba vupfhumba (Showing courage)** - While courage might be helpful, it doesn't address the core issue of controlling access.
* **B: Ku paluxa nhundzu (Applying perfume)** - Perfume won't change a suspicious odor and might even be seen as trying to hide something.
* **C: Mpimo wa nawu wa nhundzu (The smell of perfume)** - Similar to B, this doesn't address the security concerns.



Therefore, controlling what enters your home (D) is the most logical and appropriate response based on the provided information."
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi u faneleke u xi tiva u nga si fika eka tiko ra ka n’wina?,"The best answer is **A: Loko ku ta va ni ku kambiwa ka vupfhumba** (When there is a suspicion of theft).

Here's why:

* **The initial statement** describes a situation where someone is suspected of theft or breaking and entering, with no clear reason to enter. This strongly suggests a potential crime.
* **Option A directly addresses this suspicion of theft.**  It's a logical consequence of the initial situation.
* **Options B, C, and D** are less directly connected to the initial scenario. While they *could* be consequences, they are more speculative and less probable than the suspicion of theft itself.  For example:
    * **B (Loko u boheka ku paluxa swilo leswi tlulaka mpimo wa mpfumelelo)** -  This suggests a feeling of guilt, which isn't a direct consequence of being suspected of theft.
    * **C (Loko ku ta va ku lawuriwa ka swilo swo nghena na swona)** - This is a general statement about investigation and doesn't necessarily follow directly from the suspicion of theft.
    * **D (Loko nhundzu yo karhi leyi u nghenaka na yona yi pfumeleriwa)** - This suggests the animal was also suspicious, which is tangential to the human suspicion.



Therefore, the most logical and direct consequence of being suspected of theft or breaking and entering is a suspicion of theft itself.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i ku tala ka yini leswi pfunaka vakhandziyi ku hambeta va kuma tindlela letintshwa eka Nawu wa Cochamó?","The correct answer is **B: Switshabyana**.

The passage states: ""Switshabyana swi ni tindhawu to valanga leti phyuphisaka etinhlonhlorhini ta swona."" This translates to ""The cliffs have places that offer shelter in its landscapes.""  Therefore, the cliffs offer shelter, making the cliffs the primary reason for climbers to seek different routes.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku vona swo saseka (The view):** While the view might be a factor, the passage doesn't highlight it as the *reason* for seeking different routes.
* **C: Tinhlohlori (The landscapes):**  The landscapes *contain* the cliffs and shelters, but they aren't the direct reason for changing routes.
* **D: Makhumbi (The cliffs):**  Cliffs are the *object* being climbed, not the reason for seeking different routes.  It's the *shelter* within the cliffs that's important.



"
"Eka xiyenge lexi nyikeriweke laha, hi xihi xihahampfhuka lexi hlanganisaka tindhawu to tala le Southern Hemisphere?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Star Alliance yi hlanganisa hinkwato handle ka vuxeni bya South Pacific ku suka eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti..."".  This directly links Star Alliance to flights connecting destinations in the Southern Hemisphere (South Pacific).

The other options are incorrect:

* **SkyTeam:** The passage explicitly says there isn't a single alliance connecting the Atlantic and Pacific as SkyTeam does.
* **South Pacific:** This is a *region*, not an airline alliance.
* **LATAM Oneworld:** The passage mentions LATAM as part of a flight *within* Star Alliance, but doesn't suggest LATAM Oneworld is an alliance. It mentions LATAM specifically connecting South America and the South Pacific.



"
Hi wihi nhlangano wa swihahampfhuka lowu hlanganisa mpfhuka lowutsongo wa le lwandle le Southern Hemisphere?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

The passage states: ""Hambiswiritano, Star Alliance yi hlanganisa hinkwato handle ka vuxeni bya South Pacific ku suka eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti..."". This directly links Star Alliance to flights in the South Pacific.
"
Hi wihi nhlangano wa vuvalangi lowu siveke Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage states: ""Hi wihi nhlangano wa vuvalangi lowu siveke Global Running Tours? **Go Running Tours**"" 

This directly answers the question. The other options are incorrect based on the text provided."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, Go Running Tours yi pfuna ku hlanganisa mihlangano yingani yo hambana yo valanga?","The correct answer is **A: Mune**.

The passage states: ""Yo tala ya yona ya tiyimela. Lava vuyeriwaka eka mapfhumba ya misava hinkwayo yo tsutsuma va nhlanganise vatsutsumi lava valangaka ekamatikonkulu ya **mune**."" This translates to: ""Its peak has been reached. Researchers from various countries who were recognized for studying various world summits gathered at the summit of the **month**.""

Therefore, the Go Running Tours wants to organize summits *monthly*.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""Minkarhi yin'wana tinghala, tikanka (cheetahs) na tiyingwe a ti swi lavi ku voniwa naswona ti voniwa kahle hi swilo swo tirhisiwaka ku vona kule."" This translates to: ""Sometimes, cheetahs and leopards do not like to be seen, and they are well spotted using tools used to see them.""  This directly indicates that using tools for spotting is a way to see cheetahs.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ku ya eka safari yo hayika** (Go on a remote safari) - While this *could* increase the chances, it doesn't guarantee seeing a cheetah, and isn't the *direct* answer to the question.
* **B: Ku famba hi milenge ekhwatini** (Walk on the plains) - Walking on the plains might increase your chances, but it's not the primary method highlighted in the passage.  Cheetahs are known to be elusive and unlikely to be seen while walking.
* **D: Ku famba hi movha ni ku tirhisa xitirhisiwa xa ntolovelo** (Go on a vehicle and use binoculars) - The passage mentions using *tools* to spot them, and binoculars are a tool for spotting. However, it doesn't specifically say going on a vehicle is the best way.

Therefore, using tools to spot the animals is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka wihi wa xiharhi lowu mupfhumba a nga tshukaka a hlanga na xona loko a famba hi movha ku valanga swiharhi?","The correct answer is **D: Tikanka**.

The passage states: ""Minkarhi yin'wana tinghala, tikanka (cheetahs) na tiyingwe a ti swi lavi ku voniwa naswona ti voniwa kahle hi swilo swo tirhisiwaka ku vona kule."" This translates to: ""Sometimes, cheetahs and leopards like not to be seen and are also well seen with the tools used to see them.""

Therefore, cheetahs (tikanka) are mentioned as animals that might be seen during a safari.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga hungutaka ntsengo wa riendzo ro valanga?","The correct answer is **D: Ku kuma ntlawa wa ntsevu kumbe ku tlula**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people often get fined when driving alone, and this is likely because it creates the impression that they *should* have passengers to justify the toll.  Therefore, encountering a passenger or a vehicle with passengers is the reason the toll is triggered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku famba u ri wexe?** (Driving alone?) While driving alone *can* trigger the toll, the passage emphasizes the *presence of other vehicles* as the catalyst for the system.
* **B: Ku famba tanihi ntlawa** (Driving with a certain number of passengers?) The passage doesn't specify a minimum number of passengers required.
* **C: Ku famba na munhu un’wana** (Driving with another person?)  This is related to D but not as specific. It doesn't address the possibility of animals being present as well.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a kuma ntsengo wo chipa wa riendzo ro valanga?","The correct answer is **A: Vaendzi lava tiyimiseleke ku cincacinca mimovha (People who are determined to evade taxes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people sometimes get fined when they drive without proper documentation, and this is often linked to the potential for tax evasion. The text suggests that the fines are a deterrent to encourage people to pay taxes. Therefore, those actively trying to avoid taxes are the ones most likely to be caught and fined.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi hoxeke xandla leswaku San Francisco yi tekeriwa enhlokweni?","The correct answer is **C: Ikhonomi ya yona leyi titshegeke hi swo tala.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ikonomi ya yona yi titshege hi swo tala"" which translates to ""its economy is strongly rooted"".  The rest of the passage elaborates on the *reasons* for this strong economy, and how it led to San Francisco's reputation.  Option C directly reflects the initial statement about the economy being a foundation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hamba yi va kona eka mixaka yo hlaya ya vutshila ni lava vikaka mahungu** - This translates to ""There is a rise in luxurious tastes and those who want to scavenge for gold."" While San Francisco experienced a gold rush, the passage doesn't link *current* reputation to this. Also, it's not a primary reason for being esteemed.
* **B: Miako ya xiyimo xa le henhla yo hlangana eka yona** - This translates to ""The eras of the old age of the economy meet in it"".  The passage mentions San Francisco's historical importance in the gold rush, but doesn't focus on a convergence of historical economic eras.
* **D: Xivono lexi endlaka nhluvuko xa swakudya swa le Asia** - This translates to ""The views that are the result of the development of food from Asia"". While San Francisco is known for its Asian cuisine, the passage states it's one of *many* things that contribute to its reputation, not the core reason for being esteemed.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi San Francisco?","The correct answer is **A: Yi kombisiwe ko tala eka timuvhi ni tibuku**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""San Francisco yi tumbuluxe miako yo tala ya vupfhumba, laha ku katsekaka tihotela, tindhawu to dyela ni tindhawu to khoma tinhlengeletano eka tona ta xiyimo xale henhla.""  This directly translates to ""San Francisco ushered in the early years of the counterculture, with the occupation of hotels, restaurants, and places to host gatherings at the site of the old economy.""

The passage also mentions that San Francisco is known for its excellent Asian cuisine. This contradicts option B (""Swakudya swa le Asia swi tele"" - Asian food is scarce). Options C and D are also incorrect because the passage emphasizes the *occupation* of places, not that they were historically significant. The passage states the economy is *built* on counterculture, not *dependent* on it.

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that San Francisco's counterculture history has been depicted in movies and books.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka wihi wa mupfhumba loyi a nga tshukaka a nga vuyeriwi hi ku tirhisa vukorhokeri bya muyimeri wa swo famba?","The correct answer is **C: Mupfhumba loyi a nga si kumaka vhisa yakwe (Passport)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that tour operators provide packages including food, transportation, and accommodation, and even help with things like visa applications.  It also mentions that they might need documents like passports for things like visas.

Therefore, a problem a traveler might face that a travel agency's services *cannot* solve is forgetting their passport (or other vital travel documents). The agency can help with visas, food, accommodation, and transportation, but they can't retrieve a forgotten passport.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga boxiwangiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi vuyelo bya ku buma hi ku tirhisa muyimeri wa vupfhumba?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku hatlisisiwa ka mapapila yo famba (Travel documents)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *cannot* be included in a box when booking travel using a credit card. The text explicitly states that travel documents (like visas) are typically sent to the booked location *after* the traveler has arrived and needs them. Therefore, they wouldn't be part of the initial box of items booked using a credit card.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mitsengo ya tihotela (Hotel costs):** Hotel costs are a primary component of the booking and would definitely be included.
* **C: Tiphakeji leti katsaka hinkwaswo (Packages that include food):** Food packages are a common part of travel arrangements and would be included.
* **D: Ku vekisa ndhawu (Arranging a place):** Arranging a place (the hotel) is the core of the booking and would definitely be included.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana switirhisiwa leswi kotaka ku hundzuluxela tsalwa swi tsandzeka ku endla yini?","The correct answer is **C: Ku hundzuluxela marito lama nga eka swilo hi ku tirhisa foni ya manguva lawa.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Swin’wana swa switirhisiwa eka kholamu leyi swi nga hundzulela marito lama nga le ka tindzimi tin’wana eka xikombo kumbe swilo swin’wana loko mutirhisi a komba foyini ya manguva lama eka swilo sweswo.""  This translates to: ""Other tools are used in the column which can translate words that are in other languages on the screen or other things when the user points the mouse at certain items."" This highlights the use of mouse/touch interaction with a translation tool.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku hundzuluxela mifungho ya tindzimi ta matiko mambe** (Translating ancient language texts):  The passage focuses on modern translation tools and how they interact with user input (mouse/touch). It doesn't mention ancient languages.
* **B: Ku hundzuluxela swiyenge hinkwaswo swa marito** (Translating entire phrases): While translation *can* involve phrases, the core concept highlighted is the ability to translate individual words or elements within a larger context, often triggered by user interaction.
* **D: Ku hundzuluxela hi ku pakanisa ka 100%** (Translating with 100% accuracy):  The passage acknowledges that translation tools aren't perfect (""data ya ririmi leri u ri lavaka"" - language data you are looking for) and doesn't claim 100% accuracy.



"
I yini lexi pfumelelaka vuhundzuluxeri ku endliwa u nga pfulanga inthanete?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku dawuniloda rungula ra ririmi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Yin’wana ya tiapp leti dumeke eka muxaka lowu i Google Translate, leyi yi ku pfumelelaka leswaku u hundzuluxeriwa hambiloko u nga nghenanga eka inthanete endzhaku ka ku dawunilowda data ya ririmi leri u ri lavaka."" (One of the popular apps for this purpose is Google Translate, which allows for translation to happen initially without needing to go online afterwards by downloading language data you want.)

This directly refers to downloading language data, which allows for offline translation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Switirhisiwa leswi antswisiweke swo hundzuluxela:** While translation software is essential, the text emphasizes *how* offline translation is possible, not just the software itself.
* **B: Tifoni ta manguva lawa:** While smartphones are used to run translation apps, the key factor for offline translation is the downloaded language data.
* **D: Switirhisiwa eka xiyenge xo hundzuluxela marito hi ku kongoma:**  This describes a different type of translation technique (stemming) and isn't the main point regarding offline translation.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga vangeliki ku wa ka gamboko?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku tlhava ka dyambu (Burning of the wood)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nkarhi wun’wana lexi sungulaka ku vohlisa gamboko i dyambu loko ri yi kufumeta..."" This translates to ""Sometimes the thing that starts to burn the wood is the wood when it's smoking...""  Therefore, the burning of the wood (due to smoking/heat) is a cause of the fire.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Gamboko leyi tiyeke (Forgotten fire)**: While a forgotten fire *can* cause a fire, the passage directly links *smoky wood* to the start of a fire.
* **B: Vanhu (People)**:  The passage mentions ""minkarhi yo tala i munhu"" (sometimes the first time is a person), implying people *can* start fires, but it doesn't present them as the primary or most common cause.
* **D: Gamboko leyi engetelekeke (Faulty fire)**: The passage doesn't mention faulty fires.

Therefore, **C** is the best and most directly supported answer from the text.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi waka tanihi kuwa ka gamboko?","The correct answer is **A: Gamboko yo tiya leyi nga khweziwangiki (A stubborn, unyielding patient).**

Here's why:

The passage states that a ""maribye ya gamboko leyi waka ya tolovelekile"" (a stubborn patient) is the root cause. The passage then describes how this stubbornness can lead to other patients needing to be treated.  Option A directly reflects this initial stubbornness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rigiyagiya leri nga riki na gamboko (A patient who doesn't like patients).** The passage doesn't mention anything about patients disliking other patients.
* **C: Gamboko leyi engetelekeke erigiyagiyeni (A patient who is misplaced in the ward).** The passage doesn't relate the cause to being misplaced.
* **D: Gamboko leyi nga khumbiwangiki hi vanhu (A patient who is not remembered by people).** The passage focuses on the patient's behavior and its impact, not on being forgotten.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately reflects the starting point described in the text."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, kheri yi endliwa hi swilo swihi?","The correct answer is **B: Mintsembyana ni swipayisisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tikheri ta hambana tin’wana ti na sopo kasi tin’wana a ti na yona...Eswifundzeni leswi nga le ku le en’walungwini wa Indiya na Pakistan va tirhisa yogati leswaku va sweka kheri, mani edzongeni wa Indiya ni le swifundzeni swin’wana vona va tala ku tirhisa ntswamba wa khokhonati.""

This indicates that the basic ingredients for kheri are fruits and sugar (swipayisisi ni mintsembyana). While yogurt (yogati) and coconut (ntswamba wa khokhonati) are also used in some variations, the core ingredients mentioned are fruits and sugar.
"
"Eka tindhawu tin’wana, ntswamba wa khokhonati wu pfa wu tirhiseriwa nchumu wihi eka kheri?","The correct answer is **A: Nyama**.

The text states: ""Kheri i swakudya leswi endliwaka hi nyama kumbe matsavu naswona swi cheriwa swipayisisi ni mintsembyana."" which translates to ""Kheri is a dish made with meat or mutton, and they are also cooked with spices and vegetables.""

While the text also mentions yogurt and coconut, it explicitly states that Kheri is made with meat or mutton.
"
Hikwalaho ka yini ndlela yi fanele ku rhendzeleka Tintshava Ta Transantarctic ku fika erivaleni leri tlakukeke?,"The correct answer is **B: Gamboko leyi manyaneke yi ni khombo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gamboko ya yona leyi manyaneke yi thlela yi pandzeka leyi hoxiweke mijeko."" (The small tent pole always breaks due to the wind.)  This directly indicates that the tent poles are fragile and prone to breakage. The passage then explains that the treacherous terrain of the Transantarctic Mountains makes it difficult to reach the icy river.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: McMurdo Station hakanyingi ku va ku pfariwile** (McMurdo Station is often crowded) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Titeretere leti endliweke hi ndlela yo hlawuleka ta nonoka** (The carefully constructed tents are flimsy) - The passage states the tents break due to wind, not that they're flimsy in construction.
*   **D: Swa antswa ku tlula ku famba hi Ross Sea** (It's better to travel first through the Ross Sea) - The passage focuses on the difficulties *after* reaching McMurdo Station and traveling through the Transantarctic Mountains, not a suggestion to travel through the Ross Sea first.

Therefore, the broken tent poles are the reason the treacherous terrain of the Transantarctic Mountains makes it difficult to reach the icy river."
"Ku longoloka na South Pole Traverse, i yini leswi funghiweke hi mijeko?","The correct answer is **B: Titeretere leti fambisaka mafurha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku fambiwa ntsena hi ti teretere leti endliwekeke hi ndlela yo hlawuleka, ti na swilo swa ku rhwala ndzhwalo wa mafurha na mpahla."" (People travel using specially designed vehicles in a careful way, carrying supplies and equipment.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ntila wa le McMurdo Station** - While the journey starts at McMurdo Station, the passage doesn't focus on the station itself as something funghiweke (found/needed) by the expedition.
*   **C: Mabakwa lama taleke gamboko** - The passage doesn't mention any broken bones being found.
*   **D: Minjhiko ya khombo entshaveni** - This refers to crevasses in the ice, and while they are a danger, the passage doesn't state that these crevasses are something *needed* or ""funghiweke"" by the expedition in any way.



"
I yini lexi nga boxiwangiki eka xiyenge lexi vapfhumba va faneleke va pfa va xi lemuka loko va valanga eDzongeni wa Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: Matiko yo hambana ma ni swilaveko leswi nga faniki swa Tivhisa (Diverse terrains and unpredictable weather)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the African Dzongeni is known for its diverse and challenging terrains and unpredictable weather. It mentions needing a 4x4 vehicle and being prepared for difficult conditions. It also highlights potential risks like vehicle breakdowns, injuries, and the associated costs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku valanga hi movha i ndlela leyinene etindleleni leti fambelaka etlhelo (Driving is the correct way to travel these routes):** The passage implies that driving is *necessary* but not necessarily the *correct* or *easy* way, given the challenges.
*   **C: Matiko yo tala lama akelaneke eDzongeni wa Afrika ma ni ntshamiseko (Difficult and uneven terrains in the African Dzongeni and hazards):** While this is partially true, option A encompasses more than just the terrain. The unpredictable weather and related risks are a significant factor.
*   **D: Ku bumabumeriwa 4x4 loko u famba hi movha (Overuse of 4x4 vehicles when driving):** The passage actually *recommends* using a 4x4 vehicle due to the challenging conditions. It doesn't say overuse is a problem.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tekiwaka xi ri xi xitsundzuxo xo biha eka vapfhumba loko lavaka ku valanga Dzonga wa Afrika hi movha?","The correct answer is **B: Hambileswi ku bumabumeriwaka 4x4, tindhawu to tala ta fikeleleka hi movha lowu tolovelekeke.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that using a 4x4 vehicle (especially a modified one) is a common practice for exploring the African Savannah and accessing remote areas. It also mentions that these vehicles are often necessary due to the challenging terrain and the fact that the Savannah can be unforgiving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Swilo swin’wana swa xilamulela mhangu swa boha hi nawu ku va na swona emovheni:** While certain supplies are needed, the passage doesn't link them as a primary cause of dangers.
*   **C: Ku famba hi movha i swinene eka lava lavaka ku hambuka eka tindlela ta ntolovelo:** The passage isn't focusing on whether driving is *generally* suitable, but rather the specific challenges of the Savannah.
*   **D: Matiko man’wana lama akelaneke eDzongeni wa Afrika a hi manene ku ma endzela:** While dangerous wildlife is a concern, the passage emphasizes the practical necessity of 4x4 vehicles due to the terrain.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi boxiweke eka xiyenge lexi tanihi khombo loko u siya mindzhwalo ya wena yi nga ri na munhu?,"The correct answer is **B: U nga ha tikuma u rhwala swidzidzirisi u nga swi tivi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that leaving your belongings unattended can lead to theft, and that stolen items are often not reported to the police because people are afraid of being accused of having stolen them. Option B directly reflects this fear and the potential for someone to steal your belongings because they are taking a risk and might not want to get involved with the authorities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yi nga ha yiviwa (It might be recovered):** While possible, the passage emphasizes the fear of theft and the reluctance to report it. Recovery isn't the primary concern highlighted.
* **C: Yi nga ha langutiwa onge i ya munhu u n’wana (It might be thought that it went to another person):** This is a possible outcome, but option B focuses on the *reason* people might take the risk of stealing in the first place.
* **D: Valawuri va nga ha yi languti tanihi nxungeto wa bomo (Authorities might not consider it a case of theft):** The passage states authorities are often skeptical of reports of theft, but option B addresses the act of theft itself and the potential motivation behind it.



"
I yini lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi malunghana ni ku famba ni xidzidzirisi?,"The correct answer is **A: Eka matiko man’wana, lava sungulaka ku tlula nawu va nga ha avanyiseriwa rifu.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Matiko man’wana ma ni milawu ya nsele yo xupula vanhu hambi lava va endlaka milandzu ro sungula; yi katsa malembe ya 10 ejele kumbe rifu. Tibege leti vonakaka ti nga ri na vini ti yiviwa ngopfu nakambe maphorisa ma ti ehleketelela leswaku ti nga va ti ri na tibomo.""  This implies that for some offenses, first-time offenders might not be punished with a prison sentence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku laveka vuxiyaxiya swinene loko u endzela matiko ya misava:** The text doesn't mention the severity of penalties for different types of crimes.
* **C: Timbyana leti nun’hwetelaka swidzidzirisi ti nga ha tirhisi handle ko tivisiwa:** The text says that first-time offenders *might* not be imprisoned, not that they are released without consequences.
* **D: Valawuri va nga ha teka mindzhwalo ya wena, hambiloko u nga tamelanga swidzidzirisi:** The text describes penalties for *committing* crimes, not what happens if someone *doesn't* report a crime.



"
I xonwa xihi lexi nga boxiwangiki lexi u nga ringeta ku xi endla ekaya loko u wisile?,"The correct answer is **A: Juzi (Rubbish)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how, when you clean, you collect various types of waste.  ""Juzi"" translates to ""rubbish"" or ""waste."" The question asks what you can collect when you clean your home.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kofi (Coffee)** - While coffee grounds *can* be waste, the text is broader than just coffee.
*   **C: Byala (Tree/Wood)** -  This isn't something typically found as general household waste.
*   **D: Tiya (Clothes)** - While old clothes can be thrown away, the text discusses a wider range of household waste.

Therefore, ""Juzi"" (rubbish) is the most encompassing and accurate answer based on the context of the provided text.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi kwihi laha u fanele ku endzela kona loko u endzela ndhawu laha u tshamaka kona ku ya nwa swonwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Switolo swa kofi ekulenyana ni laha u tshamaka kona**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks where to dispose of coffee grounds and other coffee remnants.** The passage explicitly states that coffee grounds and remnants can be used as fertilizer.
* **Option A directly addresses this:** ""Switolo swa kofi ekulenyana ni laha u tshamaka kona"" translates to ""Coffee grounds and remnants in the compost bin.""  Composting is a natural way to recycle organic matter like coffee grounds and turn it into fertilizer.
* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Switolo swa juzi kumbe smoothie:**  This refers to juice or smoothie disposals, not coffee grounds.
    * **C: Tibarha leti u nga titolovelangiki:** This translates to ""Non-recyclable trash"" - while coffee grounds *can* be composted, putting them in general trash is less environmentally friendly.
    * **D: Tirhesiturente leti endlaka tiya ya chamomile:** This translates to ""Restaurants that make chamomile tea"" -  irrelevant to coffee disposal.



Therefore, the best and most relevant answer is **A**."
Xana swifaniso swa matuva swi kumeka kwihi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ejarateni ra kereke (On the church's circumference)**.

The text states: ""Eka jarata ra kereke, ku na swifaniso swo tsakisa swa matuva leswi endliweke hi timavulwa ehenhla ka maribye."" This translates to ""On the church's circumference, there are swirling patterns of stones made from basalt columns.""
"
Hi wihi muxaka wa vhisa lowu nga ha lavaka leswaku munhu a nyika vumbhoni bya leswaku u ni mali leri ringaneke?,"The correct answer is **B: Vhisa ya muendzi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hi ntolovelo, ku tshama eka tiko rin’wana nkarhi wo leha ku ta lava u kuma vhisa ka ha ri emahlweni. Hi ntoloveloke leswaku tivhisa ta vadyondzi ti va na swilaveko swo hambana na milawu leyi hambaneke eka tivhisa ta vapfhumba kumbe vanhu va mabindzu. **Eka matiko yo tala, u ta lava papila ra xikolo lexi u nga tsakela ku dyondza eka xona, na vumbhoni bya mali leyi yi nga ta ku hlayisa eka lembe ro sungula ra tidyondzo ta wena.**""

This indicates that to prove you have enough money, you'd typically provide financial documentation, which is associated with ""Vhisa ya muendzi"" (loan documentation).  The other options don't fit the context:

*   **Vhisa ya nkarhinyana** (Student loan) - While students might need loans, the text refers to proving you have sufficient funds for the *start* of the research.
*   **Vhisa ya xichudeni** (Emergency loan) - Emergency loans are for immediate needs, not typically for research funding.
*   **Vhisa ya bindzu** (Mortgage) - Mortgages are for buying property, not for research.



"
I mani loyi a nga tshukaka a lava ku va ni vhisa yo leha?,"The correct answer is **A: Muendzi la fambaka ngopfu (A student who travels frequently)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that researchers often need to travel to five different locations, some of which are inhabited by people who are hunters or hermits. It also mentions that research might require searching for information in various places.  This suggests that a student who travels frequently (for school or research) would be the most likely to require research funding.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Mupfhumba la nga ni ntokoto (A hunter who is experienced)**: While hunters might be subjects of research, the passage doesn't directly imply that experienced hunters *require* funding.
* **C: Xichudeni xa le ka tiko rimbe (The community of a remote village)**:  A remote village might be a research location, but the question asks *who* needs funding, not *where* the funding might be used.
* **D: Muendzi wa ta bindzu (A person who is a beggar)**:  The passage doesn't connect beggars with research funding.
"
Hi rini laha ngopfungopfu u fanele ku xiyaxiya tinsuna?,"The correct answer is **A: Hi tin’hweti ta ximumu (During the rainy season)**.

The passage states: ""Ngopfu ngopfu eka ximumu..."" which translates to ""Dusty during the rainy season..."".  This directly links the dust (ngopfungopfu) to the rainy season (ximumu). Therefore, dust is more likely to be a problem during the rainy season.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi u faneleke u papalata ku xi endla leswaku u nga karhatiwi hi tinsuna loko u chayela ekhwatini?","The correct answer is **A: Ku tshika tinyangwa ta movha ti pfuriwile nkarhi wo leha (Mold spores have accumulated over time)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where mold spores are present in the boat, causing allergic reactions. The key phrase is ""u tivonela eka tinsuna"" (you are allergic to mold) and ""tinsuna ti nghena na wena"" (mold enters with you).  This strongly implies the presence of mold spores, which can be a chronic issue in boats due to moisture and stagnant air.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Ku chayela hi ximumu (Traveling by boat):** While traveling by boat *can* be associated with mold, it's not the direct reason *why* the person is allergic. It's the *environment* of the boat that's the problem.
* **C: Ku chayela etindhawini ta makhwati ya mpfula (Traveling in river boat cabins):**  Similar to B, the location isn't the cause of the allergy, but a place where mold is more likely to be present.
* **D: Ku siya movha wu nga ri na munhu loko u hayika (Traveling alone in the boat):**  Traveling alone doesn't cause mold to grow. Mold grows due to environmental factors.

Therefore, the accumulated mold spores are the most likely reason for the person's allergic reaction.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi Vasundarban?","The correct answer is **C: I ndhawu leyikulu swinene emisaveni ya bandhi ra mangrove.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Vasundarbans va tshama ehenhla kwa ndhawu yo ringana na 3,850 km², laha n’we xa nharhu ku nga mati kumbe nhangasi."" This directly translates to ""Sundarbans stretches across an area of approximately 3,850 km², which is mostly water or swamp.""
* **Option C** accurately reflects this information by calling it ""I ndhawu leyikulu swinene emisaveni ya bandhi ra mangrove"" - ""It is one of the largest mangrove swamp areas in the world.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku ni makhwati ma nga ri mangani lama saleke** - ""There are many remaining forests"" - While the text mentions mangrove forests, it doesn't say how many are remaining or if they are plentiful.
* **B: Hafu ya ndhawu ya kona hinkwayo i nhlangasi** - ""Half of the area is swamp"" - The text says *mostly* water or swamp, not exactly half.
* **D: Ku ni timhala to tala ku tlula tiyingwe ta le Bengal** - ""There are ancient animals that predate those of Bengal"" - The text mentions a large number of Bengal tigers and Royal Bengal rhinos, but nothing about ancient animals predating them.

Hi xihi xiphemu xa khwati lexi nga endhawini ya India?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National Park**.

The text states: ""Tlhelo ra khwati leri welaka etikweni ra Indiya ri vitaniwe Sundarbans National Park."" which translates to ""The area of the forest located in India is called Sundarbans National Park.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i mani loyi a nga tshukaka a nga ri twisisi ngopfu ririmi ra Xinghezi?","The correct answer is **A: Vanhu lava vulavulaka tindzimi tin’wana timbirhi** (People who speak two other languages).

Here's why:

The passage states that in early times, people who spoke Xhosa (and presumably other languages) often had a stronger grasp of the language than those who didn't. The example of people from Manchester, Boston, and Sydney meeting in Toronto illustrates that people who speak multiple languages can understand each other even if they don't speak English as their first language.  Therefore, someone who speaks two other languages is less likely to struggle with understanding English.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vanhu lava nga vantshwa hi malembe** (People who have been deaf since birth): Deafness doesn't directly correlate with difficulty understanding English, especially if they've been educated and exposed to the language.
* **C: Vanhu lava endzelaka Toronto** (People who went to Toronto):  Being in Toronto doesn't determine someone's English comprehension skills.
* **D: Vanhu lava kuleke hi malembe** (People who have been away for years):  Length of absence doesn't determine English comprehension skills.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tikaka ku xi vitana?","The correct answer is **D: Marito lama tikaka ku ma vula ya ndhawu (Language that adapts to local expressions)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes how people from different places (Manchester, Boston, Sydney) can communicate and understand each other even though they speak different languages.
* They use elements of their native languages and local expressions to bridge the gap.
* This adaptation of language to the local context is exactly what ""Marito lama tikaka ku ma vula ya ndhawu"" describes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Marito hikuya hi mavitanelo ya kona yo hlawuleka (Language that is characterized by its local customs)** - While customs play a role, the focus of the passage is on *language* adapting.
* **B: Tiadirese (Translation)** - Translation is a process of converting language from one form to another, which isn't the main point of the passage. The passage focuses on adaptation and blending, not direct translation.
* **C: Marito lama tsariweke (Standard Language)** - The passage implies that standard language isn't always sufficient and that adaptations are necessary.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xiyimo lexi nga vaka xinene eka mupfhumba loyi a hlelaka ku famba hi bazi ku suka exitichini xa le ndzeni ka xifundzha?","The correct answer is **A: Mupfhumba u ya eJakar naswona se u xava thikithi ka ha ri emahlweni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hambileswi wo tala, ngopfu ngopfu lama yaka evuxeni ni le Jakar/Bumthang ya famba exikarhi ka 06:30 na 07:30.""  This indicates people went to Jakar or Bumthang in that time frame.
* **The passage also says:** ""Tanihi leswi mabazi lama nghenaka eka xifundza nkarhi wunwana ya tala, swa tsundzukiwa leswaku u xava tikithi masiku ma nga ri mangani."" This means people who arrived early at the station bought tickets.
* **The passage mentions:** ""Mathekisi lama tirhisiwaka hi vanhu vo tala i ndlela yo hatlisa ni leyi u tshamaka kahle yo famba hi yona kuya e tindhawu tale kusuhi, to fana na Paru (Nu 150 ) na Punaka (Nu 200)."" This refers to early travelers taking efficient and comfortable routes to distant locations.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the traveler went to Jakar and bought a ticket early in the morning. Options B, C, and D don't align with the information presented in the passage. Specifically, option C mentions Paro and a later departure time, which is not supported. Option D mentions arriving at the station at 6:20, which is earlier than the stated time frame for early travelers.
"
Hi xihi xitsundzuxo lexi nga vaka xinene eka muendzi loyi a lavaka ku ya evuxeni ku suka exichini xa bazi xa le ndzeni ka xifundzha?,"The correct answer is **B: Xava thikithi ka ha ri emahlweni.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tanihi leswi mabazi lama nghenaka eka xifundza nkarhi wunwana ya tala, swa tsundzukiwa leswaku u xava tikithi masiku ma nga ri mangani.""  This translates to: ""Those buses that arrive at the station in the first time, it is suspected that they have bought tickets many days in advance.""

Therefore, the reason a traveler might want to arrive early to catch the first bus is to ensure they have a ticket.  The other options are not supported by the text:

* **A: Tibazi ti suka hi 8:30 ntsena** (Buses start at 8:30 sharp) - The text doesn't mention a specific departure time, only that the first buses are very popular.
* **C: Tibazi to tala ta suka siku hinkwaro** (The first buses start from the day) - While the text suggests advance ticket purchase, it doesn't state the buses start every day.
* **D: Ku hakelela thekisi yin’we ku nga ha va ndlela leyinene yo famba** (Waiting for another transport may be the right way to travel) - The text focuses on the bus service and doesn't suggest alternative transport.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki nhlamuselo leyi kongomeke ya Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ya ha tsakeriwa hi vapfhumba lava lavaka ku tiva.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi 1990, yi hoxiwe eka nongonoko wa tindhawu ta misava ta ndhavuko leti ngale nghozini, hikwalaho ko xungetiwa hi sava ra le kwandzasini."" This translates to: ""In 1990, it was looted by the terrorist group in the region, due to being targeted by a military invasion.""

Option D directly reflects this statement about the city being looted by terrorists. The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: Yi ni nkucetelo lowukulu wa vu Arabiwa ku tlula tiko hinkwaro?** (Does it have a major legacy of Arab culture surpassing African culture?) While the passage mentions Arab influence, it doesn't state it's *greater* than African culture.
*   **B: Yi ni vusweti** (It has a scholarship) The passage does mention a historical legacy, but doesn't focus on the current state of scholarship.
*   **C: A yi fikelelekihi hi xihahampfhuka** (Is it inaccessible due to corruption?) The text does not reference corruption.



"
Eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi yihi leyi nga ntiyiso hi Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Yi hava swilo swa le Afrika ku hambana ni madoroba ya le kusuhi.**

Here's why:

* The text states that Timbuktu is unique because it has a strong Arab influence *alongside* African influences, unlike many other cities in the region. This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Doroba leri ra fikelelaka hi xihahampfhuka:** The text mentions the city being a center of trade, but doesn't explicitly say its prominence was *due* to trade.
* **B: Ri xongile ematshan’weni yo va evuswetini:** The text says Timbuktu was looted in 1990, which is a negative event, not a period of prosperity.
* **D: Doroba leri a ra ha koki vapfhumba:** The text says Timbuktu became a center of learning and had a strong intellectual tradition, attracting scholars.
"
Xana Tiolimpiki ta ximumu xi sungule ku hleriwa rini? ,"The correct answer is **A: August 2021**.

The text states: ""Mintlangu ya vanhu lava lamaleke yi ta sungula hi ti 24 ku ya fika ti 5 ta September 2021."" (The Paralympic Games will start from September 24th to 5th, 2021.) This indicates the Paralympics started in September 2021. The question asks when the Summer Olympics started, and the text mentions the Olympics were held in Tokyo in 1964 and again in 2020. However, the text *doesn't* state the Olympics started in August 2021. August 2021 is when the **Summer Olympics** were held.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana moya lowukulu wu hundzuka rini xihuhuri?","The correct answer is **A: Loko mimoya yi fika eka rivilo ra 100 wa timayile hi awara**.

The passage states: ""Ti endla moya lowukulu (nkarhi wun’wana 100-200 ti mayile/awara)..."" which translates to ""It causes strong winds (sometimes 100-200 miles/hour)..."". This directly answers the question of when strong winds (caused by the whirlwind) occur.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi fambisanaka ni xihuhuri?,"The correct answer is **D: I swiyenge leswi rhendzelekaka leswi susumetelaka moya ehandle**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Xihuhuri xi moya wa pureja ya le hansi lowu rhendzelekaka, lowu kokaka moya lowu nga ekusuhi wu nghena wu tlhela wu huma hi le henhla. Ti endla moya lowukulu (nkarhi wun’wana 100-200 ti mayile/awara) naswona xi nga tlakula swilo swo tika swiya emoyeni..."" 
* This means a thunderstorm is a type of weather event driven by rising, warm air.
* Option D directly reflects this by stating that thunderstorms are associated with dangerous, weather-related phenomena.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Swihuhuri swi tshamela ku pfuxa mimoya rivilo ra 100-200 wa timayile hi awara:** While thunderstorms *do* involve winds of that speed, the defining characteristic isn't *just* the wind speed.
* **B: Swi tala ku tlakula swilo swo tika:** Thunderstorms *can* cause the precipitation of things, but the passage states they can *compress* things into the air, and that's a key aspect of how they form.
* **C: Swi va ni xiyimo xa xihuhuri loko swi khumba misava:** The passage says thunderstorms are ""xihuhuri"" *when they rumble*. The rumbling is a consequence of the storm, not the defining characteristic of the storm itself.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana mupfhumba a nga xi kuma kwihi xitsundzuxo malunghana ni xiyimo xa politiki xa doroba leri a ri endzelaka?","The correct answer is **C: Eka vaakatiko va tiko leri a nga ta ri endzela (Government officials of the country in question)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi xikombiso, vaakatiko va Amerika lava tshamaka eMiddle East va nga khomiwa hi tindlela leti nga faniki hi vanhu va leYuropa kumbe Maarabu. Swilemukiso leswi ko va nkatsakanyo wa xiyimo xa tipolitiki xa tiko ro karhi.""  This directly implies that government officials of the country (in this example, the US) are responsible for the decisions and actions that influence the country's political landscape.  They are the ones who create and implement policies that have consequences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eka hulumendhe ya tiko leri a nga ta ri endzela (The government of the country in question):**  While the government is involved, ""vaakatiko"" (officials) are a more specific and accurate term. The passage focuses on the individuals within the government who make decisions.
* **B: Eka swibumabumelo swa vatsundzuxi va maendzo (The decisions of experts):**  The passage doesn't focus on experts. While experts might advise, the ultimate responsibility rests with the government officials.
* **D: Eka hulumendhe ya yena (His/Her government):** This is too vague. The question asks about the influence of the country's government, not just the individual's personal government (which might be irrelevant).



"
"Loko switsundzuxo swa maendzo, xana hi swihi leswi muaki wa tiko rimbe a nga tshukaka a nga langutani na swona?","The correct answer is **C: Ndzindzakhombo wa rihanyo lowu khumbekaka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Loko switsundzuxo swa matiko man'wana swi endleriwe vaakatiko va matiko wolawo. Hi xikombiso, vaakatiko va Amerika lava tshamaka eMiddle East va nga khomiwa hi tindlela leti nga faniki hi vanhu va leYuropa kumbe Maarabu."" This illustrates how national identity and history contribute to the formation of a nation's political climate.  The passage links national history to the potential for national pride/ego (""ndzindzakhombo wa rihanyo"").

* **Option A** is too general. While national pride *can* lead to a desire for counseling on actions, it's not the *primary* or most direct consequence outlined in the passage.
* **Option B** is also too general. While political climate is affected, the passage focuses more on the national identity aspect.
* **Option D**  while technically related, is not the most direct consequence illustrated by the passage.



Therefore, the passage emphasizes that **national pride/ego** is a direct consequence of historical development and influences the political climate."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i muxaka muni wa riendzo lowu nga tshukaka wu nga lavi ngopfu mpfuno wa ku buma eka muhleri wa maendzo?","The correct answer is **A: Riendzo ra nhlengeletano wa ntirho edorobeni leri muendzi a tshameke a ri endzela** (A job fair in the town where the person lives).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that job fairs are good for finding jobs that align with one's interests, skills, and the economic situation of the area.**  A job fair in the local town directly fits this description. It offers immediate opportunities and aligns with local needs.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Riendzo ro leha mavhiki mambirhi ro mpimo lowo kongome wo tirhisa mali** (A two-week intensive program that uses money) - This sounds like a training program, not necessarily a job-finding opportunity, and the focus of the passage is on finding employment.
* **C: Riendzo leri nga ta katsa xiphiqo xa ririmi** (A program that could cover language proficiency) - While language skills are valuable, the passage doesn't specifically mention language programs as key job fairs.
* **D: Riendzo ro ya entsungeni ro sungula eka muendzi** (Going abroad to start a business) - This is a significant undertaking and not the focus of the passage, which highlights local job fair advantages.



Therefore, a local job fair is the most aligned with the passage's core message about job fairs being beneficial for finding relevant employment opportunities."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xiyimo laha muendzi a nga vuyeriwaka swinene eka muhleri wa maendzo?","The correct answer is **D: Loko muendzi a endzela ndhawu laha a toloveleke mindhavuko ya kona.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that tourists often travel to places with unique culture, language, or economic opportunities.  It also mentions that early travelers established routes and systems. Therefore, a tourist who is interested in the local culture (mindhavuko) of a destination is more likely to be drawn to it.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Loko muendzi a buka swihahampfhuka swa ku ya ni ku vuya edorobeni ra ka vona:** While practical, this isn't a primary motivator for choosing a destination.
* **B: Loko muendzi a tsakela ku buka vuvalangi byo hlawuleka ro sungula:**  This suggests a desire for basic resources, not necessarily a cultural or experiential one.
* **C: Loko muendzi a ri kota kahle ririmi leri vulavuriwaka laha a yaka kona:**  Language skills are helpful, but not as crucial or motivating as an interest in the culture itself.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga pfunaka muendzi ku papalata ku khomiwa hi tingana loko a endzela tindhawu letintshwa?","The correct answer is **A: Ku langutela leswaku swilo swi fana ni le kaya (Thinking that things are the same as at home)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a mistake people make when in a new environment is assuming everything is the same as home. This leads to problems because customs, laws, food, traffic rules, etiquette, and language can all be different. Therefore, thinking things are the same as home is the reason someone might be tempted to act carelessly in a new place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku tiyimisela ku ringeta swakudya leswi nga tolovelekangiki (Ensuring to take unsafe food):** The passage doesn't mention food safety being a reason for careless behavior, only the difference in food customs.
* **C: Ku landzela milawu yo fana ni ya le kaya (Following the same laws as at home):** The passage explicitly warns that laws might be different.
* **D: Ku papalata ku rhanga hi ku endla ndzavisiso hi byetlelo (Being careless by making excuses about etiquette):** The passage mentions etiquette as something that can be different and lead to problems. It doesn't suggest people would be careless *because* of etiquette excuses.



"
"Hi ku landza rungula leri nga eka xiyenge lexi, i munhu wa muxaka muni loyi a nga ha khomiwaka hi tingana loko a endzela tiko rimbe?","The correct answer is **B: Munhu loyi a tsakelaka ku cinca ka swilo (Someone who is intolerant to change)**.

Here's why:

* The passage discusses the importance of adapting to new environments and understanding that things will be different from home. 
* The question asks which type of person would be most likely to struggle when facing a new culture.
* **Intolerance to change** directly aligns with the passage's message. Someone who resists change will find it very difficult to adjust to new customs, laws, food, etc., and is therefore likely to struggle.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Munhu loyi a rhandzaka swakudya swa vulovolovo (Someone who loves spicy food):**  While this could be a preference, it doesn't directly relate to the challenges of adapting to a new *culture*.
* **C: Munhu loyi a pfumalaka mianakanyo yo pfuleka (Someone who is very principled):** While strong principles are good, inflexibility *because* of principles could lead to conflict in a new culture where different norms exist.  But ""intolerance to change"" is a more precise fit.
* **D: Munhu loyi a tsakelaka ku dyondza (Someone who dislikes studying):** This is unrelated to cultural adaptation.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xitsundzuxo lexi bumabumeriwaka eka vaendzi lava sungula ku endzela tiko leri ra ha hluvukaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku rhanga hi ku tiva swimila swa ndhawu u nga si endlela ehansi.**

Here's why:

The passage describes how people who travel to unfamiliar places often behave differently. They are more cautious and take precautions.  One of those precautions is being aware of the surroundings and not doing things that could put them at risk.  **""Ku rhanga hi ku tiva swimila swa ndhawu u nga si endlela ehansi""** translates to ""Be careful and avoid doing things that are not safe"" which aligns perfectly with the examples given in the passage (not going to dangerous places, being careful with food, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku papalata ku dya ngopfu eka masiku yo sungula** (Eating a lot on the first few days) - The passage actually suggests being careful with what you eat and avoiding potentially unsafe food sources.
* **C: Xiponci ni sangu i swinene loko u ta ndzima tendze** (A mosquito net and repellent are essential when you sleep) - While mosquito nets and repellent *are* good precautions, the passage doesn't specifically say they are *essential* in the way option C implies. It focuses more broadly on being aware of potential dangers.
* **D: Hakelela hotela ya xiyimo lexinene loko wa ha ku fika** (Check into a reputable hotel when you arrive) - This is a good suggestion, but the passage emphasizes more general caution and awareness of your surroundings, not just finding a hotel.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki tanihi nchumu wo wu dya ngopfu loko wa ha titoloveta tiko leri ra ha hluvukaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Matirasi kumbe xiponci loko u dzima tende.**

Here's why:

The passage describes precautions taken when staying in unfamiliar places, particularly those with potential dangers like snakes, scorpions, etc.  One crucial precaution is to protect yourself from things that crawl or are on the ground.  This leads directly to the need for a safe sleeping surface.

* **C (Matirasi kumbe xiponci loko u dzima tende - Mattress or a blanket when sleeping on the ground)** directly addresses this need. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A (Swakudya swa muxaka wa Xilungu - English cuisine):** While you might eat different foods in a new place, the passage doesn't focus on cuisine.
* **B (Vukorhokeri bya xiyimo -  Hotel reservations):**  The passage implies you might stay at a hotel, but doesn't make it a central point of the safety precautions described.
* **D (Tihotela ta xiyimo - Luxury hotels):** Similar to B, the type of hotel is not the main point. The focus is on general safety measures when in an unfamiliar location.

"Eka mihlawulo leyi landzelaka hi swihi leswi nga swinene eka loyi a nga ni pholisi loyi a lavaka ku kuma kopi ya pholisi yo yi hlayisa eka online, kambe a ri hava inthanete?","The correct answer is **D: Ku hlayisa kopi eka “cloud”**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kopi yin'wana ya swilo leswi u nga tihlayisela yona eka online (hi ku tiimeyilela yona yi ri ni swilo leswi lavekaka kumbe u yi hlayisa eka """"cloud"""").""  This means storing a copy in the cloud is a valid and recommended method.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable based on the text:

*   **A: Ku nyika kopi eka munghana loyi u fambaka na yena:** While mentioned, the text encourages *multiple* copies and provides more versatile options.
*   **B: Ku tirhumelela kopi hi imeyili:** The text mentions email as an option, but also refers to storing the copy in the cloud for more robust accessibility and security.
*   **C: Ku hlayisa kopi eka laptop:**  The text mentions laptop/tablet as a storage location, but it highlights the benefit of cloud storage for offline access and potentially easier sharing.

Therefore, the text strongly supports storing the copy in the cloud.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga faneliki ku kombisiwa eka pholisi?","The correct answer is **C: Tinambara ta matiko ya le handle to kuma mpfumelelo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ti fanele ti va ni imeyili adirese ya ndzindzakhombo ni tinambara to kota ku fonela ematikweni ya le handle loko u lava switsundzuxo/kumbe u lava ku endla swikombelo.""  This translates to ""They should have a company email address and phone numbers to contact the relevant authorities if you need assistance/or want to make a complaint.""

While email addresses and phone numbers *are* mentioned, the text specifies the phone numbers are for contacting the authorities for assistance or complaints.  Option C is the closest and most accurate reflection of what the text says regarding information that would be useful (and potentially required) for authorities.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tinambara to kota ku fonela ematikweni ya le handle:** This is too general.  The text implies these numbers are specifically for *authorities* and related to support/complaints.
* **B: Adirese ya imeyili ya ndzindzakhombo:**  This is mentioned, but not as crucial as the contact information for authorities.
* **D: Adirese ya imeyili ya n’wini wa pholisi:** The text does *not* mention providing an email address for a police officer.

Therefore, **C** is the best answer because it directly aligns with the text's instructions for providing contact information to relevant authorities.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi wihi mpimo wa negative lowu kombisa muxaka wa filimi lowu tirhisaka ngopfu?","The correct answer is **A: 6 x 6 cm negative**.

Here's why:

The question asks which negative size has the largest area, and the provided text states:

*   35mm negative: 3136 mm2
*   6x6 cm negative: 56 x 56 mm = 3136 mm2

While the areas are technically equal, the question is looking for the size where a *larger* negative is being used. The text explicitly states that 6x6 cm negatives have a significantly higher resolution than 35mm negatives. Therefore, the 6x6 cm negative has a larger physical size.

The other options are incorrect:

*   B: 56 x 56 mm negative: This is the *area* of the 6x6cm negative, not its designation.
*   C: 35 mm negative: This is the standard negative size mentioned and used as a point of comparison.
*   D: 36 x 24 mm negative: This is the size of a 35mm film negative.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi wihi muxaka wa filimi lowu nga ni resolution leyi fanaka na DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Filimi ya 35 mm**.

Here's why:

The question asks which film format has a resolution comparable to DSLR. The text states that 35mm film has a resolution ""leya ringanakanyana ni leya sweswi ya DSLR"" (comparable to that of DSLR).  The other options are explicitly stated to have either lower or higher resolution than 35mm.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi hi rihi goza ro hetelela eku sunguleni bindzu ro tsala hi swa vufambi?","The correct answer is **A: Ku titoloveta matsalelo eka webusayiti**.

Here's why:

The question asks what's needed to *initiate* a travel blog. The provided text says: ""Endzhaku ka loko u kota matsalelo ni ku lunghisa matsalelo eka webusayiti..."" which translates to ""After you get the domain and fix the domain, then you can create your own website.""  Therefore, getting the domain and fixing it (which is essentially troubleshooting and resolving issues) is the *initial* step.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku tsala tinhlokomhaka to hlaya eka bulogo ya vufambi leyi nga ni vito lerinene** (Creating relevant content for a travel blog with a proper name): This comes *after* you have a website.
*   **C: Ku tiendlela webusayiti ya wena** (Creating your own website): This is a later step; it's what you do *after* the domain is set up and working.
*   **D: Ku lota vuswikoti bya wena byo lunghisa matsalelo** (Fixing your domain name): While fixing the domain is part of the process, getting the domain in the first place (and then fixing it if needed) is a broader initial step.  The text implies there might be issues with the domain that need to be resolved.



"
"Loko u sungula bindzu ro tsala hi swa vufambi, eka vuswikoti lebyi landzelaka hi byihi lebyi faneleke ku rhanga byi lotiwa?","The correct answer is **B: Ku lulamisa webusayiti (Optimizing the website)**.

Here's why:

The question asks about actions to take **after** you've started a travel blog. The provided text states you need to first ""kota matsalelo ni ku lunghisa matsalelo eka webusayiti"" (fix problems and correct problems on the website) *before* you can create your own website.  Optimization is a crucial step to improve the user experience and search engine ranking *after* the basic website is functional.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ku buloga (Blogging):** Blogging is the core activity of a travel blog, but it's not the immediate next step after starting the blog.
* **C: Ku lunghisa matsalelo (Fixing problems):** Fixing problems is a *necessary* step *before* optimization, but it's not the action *following* the initial launch. The text says this happens *before* you build the website.
* **D: Ku endla webusayiti (Building the website):**  The text says you can only build your own website *after* fixing and correcting problems.



Therefore, optimizing the website is the logical next step after fixing any initial issues and before creating your own website from scratch.

Xana swiphiqo swa le ndzeni ka khwiri swi toloveleke eka maxelo ya njhani?,"The correct answer is **B: Eka maxelo yo titimela ma tlhela ma hisa swinene** (Independent studies that have shown strongly).

The text states: ""Leswi mukhuhlwana wu nga tala hi xixika, ni **swiphiqo swa le ndzeni swi tinyika matimba hi ximumu naswona hambileswi swi nga riki na khombo a swi dyisi vanhu byi rhelela.**"" (The above-mentioned illnesses, and **the underlying studies that give strength to this, as well as the fact that they can overwhelm people**.)

This implies that the claims about Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's Curse, etc., are supported by studies that show these illnesses are strong and can severely impact people. Option B best captures this nuance. The other options don't accurately reflect the strength of the evidence presented.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana u nga sawutiseka hi ku tshamela ku langutana ni xiyimo xihi?","The correct answer is **C: Swiphiqo swo hefemula** (Food poisoning).

Here's why:

The passage describes how eating food from unreliable sources, especially in certain locations, can lead to various types of food poisoning (like Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's Curse, Montezuma's Revenge).  The passage explicitly states that these are ""swiphiqo swa le ndzeni swi tinyika matimba hi ximumu naswona hambileswi swi nga riki na khombo a swi dyisi vanhu byi rhelela"" which translates to ""food poisoning that is caused by bacteria and can even cause people to die.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Swiphiqo swa ndhawu** (Local food): While local food *can* be a risk, the passage focuses on the general risk of eating from *unreliable* sources, not just food from a particular location.
*   **B: Switsongwatsongwana swa ndhawu** (Local restaurants): Similar to A, the passage discusses the risk of food poisoning, not just dining at local restaurants.
*   **D: Ntungu wa Delhi Belly** (Delhi Belly disease): Delhi Belly is *an example* of food poisoning, not the encompassing term.  The passage discusses a range of food poisoning illnesses.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi pfunaka loko u famba endhawini ya Schengen?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku papalata tindhawu to hlaya to lawula phasipoto.**

Here's why:

The passage states that within the Schengen area, you can travel freely between countries and you won't be stopped at border controls.  Therefore, you need to be prepared to go through security checks and passport controls in designated areas (like airports or major train stations) *before* you travel within the Schengen zone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku endla swikombo swo hlaya swa vhisa (To do clear visa procedures):** The passage mentions visas in general, but the key point is that the Schengen area eliminates border controls *for those with a Schengen visa*. It doesn't mean you need to redo visa procedures within the Schengen area.
*   **B: Ku hlayisa mali (To save money):** While traveling *can* be expensive, the passage doesn't focus on saving money.
*   **D: Ku hava xilaveko xa phasipoto (To have a passport incident):** This is unrelated to the procedures for traveling within the Schengen area.



"
I yini lexi nga ha kumekiki esirheni ra Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **C: Makatla ya ntsumbu (Skull)**.

The passage states: ""Munhu wun’wana loyi a tsakelaka ku vona vumbhoni bya ku onhaka ka mummy hi nkarhi loyi a ku ringanyetiwa ku yi susa eka bokisi u ta dzana hikuva ku vonaka nhloko na makatla ntsena.""  This translates to: ""Someone wondered about the evidence of the mummy's being disturbed when it was found inside the coffin, and they found the head and the skull.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndhawu ya Vancouver leyi nga tshukaka yi nga tsakeriwi hi vaendzi lava xiyisisaka mitsengo? ","The correct answer is **C: Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bowen Island i ndhawu yo duma leyi vanhu va yaka eka yona ku ya tiphina ku ringana siku kumbe hi mahelo vhiki...Lava rhandza ku tiphina ehandle, va swi rhandza ku famba hi ndlela yo leha swinene.""  This suggests Bowen Island is a less expensive and more relaxed option compared to the others.

* **Granville Island:** While a popular spot, the text doesn't position it as budget-friendly.
* **Seak to Sky:** This is a road/route, not a destination.
* **Whistler:**  The text mentions it's expensive due to the 2010 Olympics.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndhawu leyi nga tshukaka yi nyika ngopfu vaendzi ntokoto wa xiviri wa le Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states, ""Bowen Island i ndhawu yo duma leyi vanhu va yaka eka yona ku ya tiphina ku ringana siku kumbe hi mahelo vhiki..."" (Bowen Island is a popular place for people to go to relax for a day or a weekend...)
* While Whistler and Granville Island are mentioned as options for activities, Bowen Island is presented as the primary destination for relaxation and escaping the city.
* Downtown Vancouver is the starting point for accessing Bowen Island and Granville Island, but not a destination for a getaway in itself.

Therefore, based on the text's emphasis on relaxation and weekend getaways, **Bowen Island** is the most fitting answer."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi rini laha vaendzi va faneleke ku endzela mahovohovo loko va lava ku vona khwatsi?","The correct answer is **A: November ku ya eka March**.

The passage states: ""Ngokuva ya mpfula (November kuya eka March), mpimo wa mati wu va wu ye ehenhla naswona mahovohovo ma ta wisa mati hi ndlela yo tsakisa.""  This directly translates to ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water level rises and the falls are spectacular.""
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi swihi leswi nga swinene hi ku endzela Victoria Falls exikarhi ka November na March?","The correct answer is **A: U kota ku vona mahovohovo handle ko siveriwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wa tiyisekisiwa leswaku u ta tsakama loko u tsemakanya buloho kumbe u famba ekusuhi ni mahovohovo."" This translates to: ""It is certain that you will get wet if you approach the falls or walk in the spray.""  The passage also says that during the rainy season (November to March), the mist rises and the spray carries water in a way that allows you to see the falls. So, you *will* see the falls, but you will be wet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku va ni vaendzi lava nga nyawuriki (There will be many people who are not bothered):** The passage says Victoria Falls is popular and attracts many people, implying it *will* be crowded.
* **C: Ku vona vuxongi lebyi hlamarisaka bya ti-Fall (To see dazzling rainbows of the falls):**  While rainbows *can* be seen, the passage focuses on getting wet and seeing the falls through the mist, not specifically on rainbows.
* **D: Ku papalata nguva ya mpfula (The rainy season will be delayed):** The passage explicitly states the rainy season is from November to March.

"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka i yini lexi nga bumabumeriwiki loko u tirhisa drone?","The correct answer is **A: Ku kamba ka ha ri emahlweni leswi u pfumeleriweke ku teka filimi ya swona.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Loko ku tekiwa ka swinepe swi nga pfumeleriwi, sweswo swi vula leswaku u nga ehleketi ni ku ehleketa hi ku teka vhidiyo eka ndhawu yo leyo.""  This translates to: ""When filming is not permitted, it opens up the possibility that you cannot film and you can be arrested for filming in that location.""

Option A directly reflects this consequence. The other options are related but not the immediate and direct outcome described in the text.
"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi tihi tindhawu letinene to teka filimi hi ku tirhisa drone?","The correct answer is **A: Ekusuhi ni mintshungu leyi nga taka yi nga karhatiwi hi vukona bya drone**.

Here's why:

The passage states that using drones requires checking regulations and obtaining a license in some cases. It also mentions restrictions like not flying near airports or in restricted areas.  Option A directly addresses this – the areas where drone operation is permitted are those where it's safe and doesn't violate regulations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eka tindhawu laha ku teka swifaniso ku nga amukeriwiki:**  The passage doesn't say drone use is *restricted* in unusable filming locations.
* **C: Eka tindhawu ta mphesamphesa laha drone yi nga vonakiki kahle:**  While avoiding detection is important, the passage focuses on legality and regulations, not necessarily stealth.
* **D: Eka tindhawu laha u kumeke mimpfumelelo ka ha ri emahlweni:**  The passage doesn't suggest drone use is specifically permitted in areas where filming is already happening without permission. It emphasizes getting the proper permissions and licenses *before* flying.



"
"Hi ku landza xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xivulwa lexi nga riki ntiyiso malunghana ni xilaveko xo tsarisa eka endlelo ra vhisa?","The correct answer is **A: Loko u tshama eka byetlelo bya muendzi, u nga ha tshuka u nga boheki ku tsarisa**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the difficulty of finding a place to stay when needing to repair something (presumably a vehicle, given the context of needing to travel). It mentions that hotels in certain areas might handle repairs, but generally, it's hard to find places offering this service. Option A directly addresses this difficulty by stating that when traveling, you might not be able to find someone to fix things. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B:** The passage says that in many cases, you'd need to contact local authorities, not that they always require repairs.
*   **C:** While it's possible to go to police stations, the passage states that it's generally hard to find repair services.
*   **D:** The passage says that in *some* places, hotels might handle repairs, but not universally.



"
Eka leti landzelaka hi yihi ndhawu leyi muendzi a nga taka a nga yi eka yona ku ya tsarisa?,"The correct answer is **D: Tihofisi ta vapfhumba**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Leswi swi nga lava ku tata fomo emaphoriseni ya kwalaho kumbe u endzela etihofisini ta vapfhumba."" This translates to ""These may require filing a report at the police station or going to the police offices."" 

Therefore, the police offices are the place where one would go to report a theft.
"
I mani loyi a nga taka a nga vuyeriwi hi ku tinyikela hi ku tirhandzela loko a ri karhi a famba?,"The correct answer is **C: Munhu loyi a nga ni ntshembo wo kuma vuswikoti lebyintshwa (Someone who doesn't have the courage to gain new experiences)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes traveling and trying new things as a way to grow, learn, and gain new perspectives.  The question asks who *wouldn't* benefit from this.  The passage implies that someone lacking the courage to embrace new experiences would be the one who misses out on the positive outcomes of travel.

Let's break down why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Munhu loyi a nga ni ntshembo wo kuma vanghana lavantshwa loko a ri entsungeni (Someone who doesn't have the courage to gain new experiences when they are in trouble):** This is close, but the passage doesn't specifically mention being in trouble.  It's more about a general lack of adventurousness.
* **B: Munhu loyi a lavaka muholo wo nyawula (Someone who loves a comfortable life):** While someone who loves a comfortable life *might* be less inclined to travel, the passage isn't directly contrasting comfort with growth.
* **D: Munhu loyi a nga tsakelaka ku ku tirha ivi a hakeriwa hi ku nyikiwa byetlelo (Someone who doesn't like to work hard and is punished by being given responsibilities):** This option is completely unrelated to the theme of travel and personal growth presented in the passage.



Therefore, option C most accurately reflects who wouldn't benefit from the kind of personal growth described in the text.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, xana ku tinyikela hi ku tirhandzela loko a ri entsungeni swi nga n’wi vuyerisa njhani muendzi loyi a landzelaka bajete?","The correct answer is **C: Ku pfa ku nyikeriwa ntirho wo hakeriwa hi ku nyikiwa byetlelo.**

Here's why:

The passage discusses how traveling and experiencing new things can lead to personal growth and new perspectives. It also mentions that making sacrifices in a budget (like saving for travel) can lead to a better future. 

The question asks how travel can motivate budget adherence.  The passage implies that the anticipation and the eventual reward of travel (the new experiences and personal growth) create a strong motivation to stick to the budget.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Muholo wa nyikeriwa nkarhi hinkwawo (Time is invested in the future):** While true, it doesn't directly explain *why* that investment motivates budget adherence.
* **B: Hakanyingi swi pfula tindlela to kuma ntirho (Often it opens up ways to understand the path):**  This is too general and doesn't specifically link travel to budget motivation.
* **D: Swi nga ku pfuna ku twisisa xiyimo hi ku angarhela (It may seek to understand the situation by wandering):** While wandering is part of travel, the passage focuses more on the *motivational* aspect of travel rather than simply seeking understanding.



Therefore, option C best reflects the passage's argument that the allure of a rewarding future experience (travel) fuels the dedication needed to adhere to a budget.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga langutiwaka tanihi xitsundzuxo lexi tolovelekeke ku ya le Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **B: Ku tshama ehoteleni ya le tlhelo.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ku famba hi bazi uya kumbe u vuya ehotela ya Disney...no vuyela ekaya."" This indicates staying at a Disney hotel is part of the typical, convenient experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku heta vhiki u ri karhi u valanga tiphaki:** While spending a week is typical, the text doesn't directly state this as *the* convenient aspect.
* **C: Ku heta riendzo hinkwaro eka muako wa le Disney:**  The text mentions the airport and hotels, but not specifically elaborate experiences at the entrance.
* **D: Ku famba hi bazi ku suka erivaleni ra swihahampfhuka ku ya ehoteleni:**  While mentioned, it's a part of the *journey*, not the overarching convenient experience of the whole trip.

Therefore, staying at a Disney hotel is the most directly supported and accurate answer.
"
Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki ntiyiso hi Walt Disney World?,"The correct answer is **D: Mathikithi yo masiku yo hlaya ma kumeka eka tiwebusayiti ta ti okixini.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Mathikithi yo tala ya xavisiwe eka inthanete hi ku tirhisa tiwebusayiti ta ti okixini to fana na eBay kumbe Craigslist ti tirhisiwa ka tsongo hi mathikiti lama tirhaka masiku yo tala."" (Early online tickets were often purchased on auction websites like eBay or Craigslist.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mathikithi yo tirhisiwa katsongo ephakini ma nga hundziseriwa eka vaendzi van’wana:** The text mentions tickets *being sold* on auction sites, not necessarily that they were *resold* to other people. The text focuses on where the *initial* tickets were often found.
* **B: Ku kumeka byetlelo endhawini leyi:** The text doesn't mention any overcrowding issues. It describes the *ease* of the travel arrangements.
* **C: Ku ni tibazi to tleketla vaendzi ku suka erivaleni ra swihahampfhuka ku ya eka muako:** The text doesn't mention any security checks or painful procedures. It highlights the seamless travel arrangements.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi nga hlanganisiwi eka khoso yo letela kumbe eka tibuku?","The correct answer is **A: Ku hanya emananga (Traveling safely)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the ""Hostile Environment Course"" teaches you how to travel safely (ku hanya emananga) in dangerous environments. It mentions being prepared for situations like being targeted by armed attackers or needing to use camouflage. The passage contrasts dangerous travel with safer travel, implying that safe travel is a key focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku lulamela mpfuno wa xilamulela mhangu (Protecting against explosive threats):** While relevant to a hostile environment, it's a *part* of the broader topic of safe travel, not the overarching theme. The passage mentions explosive threats, but it doesn't make it the primary focus of the course.
*   **C: Ku lulamela ndhawu ya nyimpi (Camouflage):** Camouflage is a *tool* used for safe travel, not the core concept.
*   **D: Ku tlanga hi ku ku encenyeta (Moving stealthily):** Stealth is a tactic used for safe travel, again, it's a tool and not the main focus.

Therefore, **ku hanya emananga** best encapsulates the central theme of what the course teaches."
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka timhaka leti landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi hlanganisiwa eka khoso yo letela?","The correct answer is **D: Tindhawu to nonon’hwa swinene (hostile environments)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the course is for environments where there is a ""hostile environment.""
* It mentions training related to ""hostile environment course"" and companies that provide such training.
* The text also talks about training to ""navigate dangerous situations"" and ""survival techniques,"" which are core components of operating in hostile environments.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Mpfuno wa xilamulela mhangu (Survival training):** While survival training *can* be a component of a hostile environment course, it's not the overarching theme. Hostile environments encompass more than just survival.
* **B: Tindhawu ta nyimpi (Military environments):**  While hostile environments can *include* military situations, the passage doesn't limit it to solely military contexts.  It suggests hostile environments can exist in various situations (e.g., dangerous situations, survival situations).
* **C: Ku hanya emananga (Navigation):** Navigation is *one skill* that might be taught in a hostile environment course, but it's not the complete picture.  The course covers a broader range of skills needed to survive and operate in dangerous situations.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi yihi ndlela leyinene yo papalata mati lama kumbexana ma thyakeke?","The correct answer is **A: Ku vurisa mali timinete ti nga ri tingani (Boiling water for varying amounts of time)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku ni tindlela to tala to tala to basisa mati, tin'wana ti tirha kahle ku lwisana ni makhombo yo karhi. Eka tindhawu tin'wana ku virisa mati minete yin'we swi enerile, kasi eka tin'wana u fanele u ma virisa timinete to hlayanyana.""  This means there isn't one single standard boiling time. It depends on the water source and potential contaminants.  The passage also mentions the risk of bottled water contamination if boiled for too long.

Therefore, boiling for a varying amount of time, based on the situation, is the most accurate and safe approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku xava mati ya mabodlhele (Boiling bottled water):** The passage warns against this, as it can lead to bottled water contamination.
* **C: Ku virisa mati ku ringana minete yin’we (Boiling water for the same amount of time):** The passage explicitly says that different situations require different boiling times.
* **D: Ku kamba mati eka swakudya swo karhi (Boiling water with food):**  While boiling with food is common, the question is about purifying the water itself, not cooking.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, i yini lexi nga tshukaka xi tika hambi kuri eka vahlamberi lava nga ni vuswikoti?","The correct answer is **A: Ku hlambela ekusuhi ni maribye ya le ndzeni ka mati** (Stranding in the shallows and debris in the water).

Here's why:

The passage states that rip currents are dangerous because they can carry people out to sea, and people have drowned trying to swim against them. It also mentions that if caught in a rip current, you might get carried to a dangerous place.  The key danger is being pulled *out* to sea, and the passage links this to encountering shallow areas (shallows) and debris within the water.  While the other options are related to water, they don't directly address the primary danger described in the passage.
"
Xana u fanele ku endla yini loko u kokiwa hi magandlati lama hobomulanaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ringeta ku huma eka magandlati ya matimba hi ku ya eka tlhelo rin’wana, ivi u hlambela u ya eribuweni hi ntolovelo.**

Here's why:

The provided text describes how rip currents are strong and dangerous.  It advises against fighting the current.  The best course of action is to swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the rip current, and then swim towards the shore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hlambela hi rivilo u langutane ni moya** - Swimming with all your strength against a rip current is exhausting and ineffective.
*   **C: Hlambela u ya eka tlhelo rin’wana** - This is generally not advised, as you'll likely exhaust yourself.
*   **D: Hlambela u dzika endzeni** - This is extremely dangerous and will lead to exhaustion and potentially drowning.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi le ka ndhawu yihi laha ku endzela xihondzo ku nga vaka nkarhi wo wisa lowu phyuphyisaka?","The correct answer is **A: Doroba leri longolokaka na Danube**.

Here's why:

The question asks where a cruise might take place to escape the heat. The passage mentions cruises on the Danube River.  The phrase ""Doroba leri longolokaka na Danube"" (A cool city on the Danube) directly connects a cool location with the Danube River, implying a location where a cruise would offer relief from heat.

The other options are less directly linked to escaping heat:

* **B: Ekusuhi na Eri Canal** (North and Erie Canal): While a canal cruise might be pleasant, it's not specifically highlighted as a way to escape extreme heat.
* **C: Minkova ya le Rhine** (Rhine River cruises):  No mention of this being particularly cool.
* **D: Ekusuhi ni tiva ra mati** (Northern and water-rich): This is too general; it doesn't pinpoint a specific location where heat might be a problem and a cruise would be a good solution.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga riki xitsundzuxo lexinene eka vavasati lava endzelaka ndhawu leyi?","The correct answer is **B: Ku xiya leswaku ku hambana ka ndhavuko ku nga ha vangela timholovo eka lava tshamaka endhawini leyi.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku ringanyetiwa leswaku vafambi hinkwavo lava nga vavasati va vula leswaku va tekiwile, kunga khathariseki xiyimo xa vukati. Swa pfuna ku tlhela u ambala rhingi (a yi fanelanga yi vonaka yi durha ngopfu.

This means that customs (and the resulting practices) are linked to potential dangers and harm. Option B directly reflects this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku papalata ku bula hi timhaka ta vatekani:** The passage doesn't mention anything about ""timhaka ta vatekani"" (business practices).
* **C: Ku papalata ku ambala rhingi:** While the passage mentions washing clothes, it's linked to avoiding harm, not the primary reason for the dangers. It's a *practice* stemming from the dangers, not the cause.
* **D: Ku sihalala loko swi laveka:** The passage doesn't mention anything about avoiding or fleeing. It focuses on customs and their potential negative consequences.



"
"Hi ku landza ndhawu leyi hlamuseriwaka eka xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xitsundzuxo lexi nga pfunaka vavasati lava nga vaendzi?","The correct answer is **A: Ku xiya leswaku a swi tolovelekanga ku landzeleriwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Swa pfuna ku tlhela u ambala rhingi (a yi fanelanga yi vonaka yi durha ngopfu. Vavasati va fanele va lemuka leswaku ku hambana ka ndhavuko swi nga va nga leswi vuriwaka ku khoma khoma munhu hi ndlela yo biha naswona swi tolovelekile ku landzeleriwa, ku khomiwa hi voko, sweswo sweswo."" This means following the custom is important and not considered inappropriate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku ambala rhingi leyikulu ku kombisa ku va u nghenele vukati:** The passage says *not* to make it too dark, implying a moderate level of darkness is expected, not excessive darkness to signal entry.
* **C: Ku twisisa leswaku ku hambana ka ndhavuko ku ringanyeta leswaku u papalata ku va ni ntshiva:** The passage says the custom is *not* something to be ashamed of; it's a part of their culture.
* **D: Loko u tshuka u gangisiwa, ala vavanuna u ba ha ehansi hi nenge:** While the passage mentions a custom about men during intercourse, it doesn't say that this is a sign of shame or that men are inherently inferior in this context. It simply describes a custom.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, hi xihi xiyimo lexi nga tshukaka xi lava muteki wa swifaniso swa swiharhi a tirhisa khamera ya tilense yo karhi?","The correct answer is **B: Loko swifaniso swi ta tirhiseriwa ku xavisiwa.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Minkarhi yo tala ntirho wo teka swiharhi swifaniso a wu tekeriwi nhlokweni kambe ku na swo tala leswi nga vuriwaka hi xifaniso xa kona. Ku teka swiharhi swifaniso minkarhi yo tala swi lava ku tirhisa khamera ya tilense to leha hambileswi swilo swo fana ni swinyenyana kumbe swiharhi leswitsongo swi lavaka tilense tin'wana. **Swiharhi swo tala leswi nga riki swa tiko rero swa kala ku swi kuma naswona mintanga yin'wana yi na milawu mayelana ni ku teka swifaniso leswaku munhu a ta swi xavisa.** Swi nga endleka swiharhi swo ri na tingana kumbe swi kariha. Swi nga endleka maxelo ma titimela, ku hisa kumbe maxelo ma nga ri kahle hi ndlela yo karhi.""

This passage emphasizes the importance of respecting privacy and adhering to laws regarding photography, especially when intending to use the photos for public display (i.e., to ""xavisiwa"" - be exhibited or published).  Options A, C, and D don't directly reflect this core principle highlighted in the passage.
"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi leswi tikaka eka vateki va swifaniso swa swiharhi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku kuma swiharhi leswi nga riki swa tiko rero**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses ethical considerations in photography, particularly regarding the potential for harm or offense. It specifically mentions:

* **Taking photos of people without their consent.**
* **Taking photos that could be hurtful or disrespectful.**
* **Taking photos of vulnerable individuals (children, the homeless, etc.).**

Option A directly reflects this concern about capturing images of sensitive or potentially exploitative subjects, which is a key ethical issue discussed in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku langutana ni swiharhi swo kariha (Collaborating with controversial subjects):** While ethical considerations might apply to collaborating with controversial subjects, the passage's primary focus isn't on collaboration.
* **C: Ku kuma tilense leti lavekaka (Finding lost lenses):** The passage doesn't mention lost lenses.
* **D: Ku tirha eka mbango wo tika swinene (Working in a professional studio):**  The passage isn't centered on studio work; it's about ethical principles that apply to various photography contexts.



"
Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga tshukaka xi vanga swiphiqo leswi nga nyawuriki eka muchayeri loyi a fambaka etintshaveni?,"The correct answer is **D: Ku tikeriwa ku vona kahle (Difficulty seeing)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Loko ku ri ni xidzedze, gamboko yitsongo leyi nga endlaka leswaku movha wu tsandzeka ku famba yi nga na hi nkarhi wutsongo swinene. Nakambe u nga ha tsandzeka ku vona kahle hikwalaho ka gamboko leyi nga eku neni kumbe leyi nga eku hungeni kumbe hikwalaho ka mathonsi lamatsongo ya mati kumbe ayisi leyi welaka eka fasitere ra movha.""

This translates to: ""When it is foggy, fog is a phenomenon that can make the car travel very slowly. Also, you may not be able to see well due to the fog being thick or being cold or due to rain drops or water droplets that have accumulated on the windshield.""

Therefore, difficulty seeing is a direct consequence of fog and the described conditions. The other options are mentioned in the passage but aren't the *primary* or most direct consequence highlighted.
"
I yini lexi nga tshukaka xi fana hi ta xibalo xa muholo eka matiko yo hambanahambana?,"The correct answer is **A: Tirheyiti (Rates)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Xibalo xa muholo xi hambanile eka matiko yo hambana, naswona ti rheyiti na tlawa wa xibalo swi hambana ku suka eka tiko kuya eka rin’wana.""  This means the *rates* (tirheyiti) are the reason for the difference in the maximum age.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku hleriwa (Registration):** While registration might be a part of the process, the passage doesn't link *registration* to the differing maximum ages.
* **C: Laha u vikaka kona xibalo (Location):** While location *plays a role* (as the maximum age is determined by the location), the passage specifically connects the differences to *rates*.
* **D: Swiyenge swa xibalo (Statistical Protection):** This term isn't used in the passage and doesn't explain the variation in maximum ages.



"
"Hikuya hi xiyenge lexi, loko u tirha entsungeni kambe u tshama kun’wana, u nga ha tshuka u rhumela kwihi xibalo xa muholo?","The correct answer is **C: Eka tiko leri u tirhaka eka rona sweswi.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the national identification number is tied to the country where you are employed.  Since you're working in a different country, the national ID number you would use is the one associated with *that* country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kwihi ni kwihi laha hakanyingi u tshamaka kona:** While you might travel, the ID is tied to where you *work*, not just where you reside.
* **B: Le United States:** The passage specifically mentions that in federal systems like the US, the ID is tied to the *state* you live in, not just the country.
* **D: Kwihi ni kwihi laha tihakelo ti nga le hansi:**  This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage.  The passage is about national ID numbers and employment, not local regulations.

Eka swivulwa leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga hlamuseliki hi ku kongoma World’s Fair?,"The correct answer is **A: Minkombiso yi nga ha kombisa matimu kumbe ndhavuko wa tiko**.

Here's why:

The passage states that World's Fairs are a major platform for showcasing plants and science, and that they present achievements and trends in the world of plants.  Option A directly reflects this - showcasing plants and national culture (which is related to the ""country's character"" or ""national trends"").

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Minkombiso ya timbala yi kombisiwa swin’we ni ya vutshila ni ya dyondzo:** The passage *already* states that plant and science exhibits are featured. So this isn't a new development *caused* by the fair's cancellation.
*   **C: Swiendlakalo swa kona swi nga teka ku fika eka tin’hweti ta ntsevu:** The passage mentions that the events can take place annually in different countries. This fact would exist regardless of any cancellation.
*   **D: Matiko a ma boheki ku hoxa xandla:** The passage does not indicate that plants would be excluded from future projects.

Therefore, the most logical consequence of cancelling World's Fairs would be a loss of a key venue for showcasing plants and national culture.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nawu wa World’s Fair kumbe International Exposition?,"The correct answer is **D: Leswaku nkhuvo lowu wu va kona, matiko hinkwawo ma fanele ku hoxa xandla.**

Here's why:

* The text states that World's Fairs are major platforms for showcasing agricultural and scientific advancements.
* It also mentions that participating countries are expected to showcase their agricultural and scientific achievements and progress.
* Option D directly reflects this expectation of participation and showcasing by different countries.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Minkombiso yi fanele ku kombisa matimu ni swiphiqo swa misava** - While true, this is already stated in the text. The question asks what *follows* from the World's Fair, not just what it *is*.
* **B: Tiko rin’we ri nga ka ri nga rhurheli minkombiso lembe ni lembe** - The text says they *usually* happen every few years, but not necessarily annually. So, this is not a definitive follow-on.
* **C: Minkombiso yi fanele ku teka tin’hweti to fika eka ntsevu** -  The text mentions the fair grounds are usually large (under 50 hectares), but it doesn't say they *must* have facilities for arriving by ship.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi ku xi endla swi nga sivelaka ku hlaseriwa hi xiharhi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku va ekule hi mpfhuka wa 25 wa timitara eka timhisi (Being 25 miles away from the food)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi ku ya hi valawuri va mintanga, vana ekule hi 100 wa timitara eka tibere ni timhisi u tlhela u va ekule hi 25 wa timitara eka swiharhi hinkwaswo!"" (According to ancient legends, people who were 100 miles away from the berries and mushrooms would eventually be 25 miles away from the predators!).

This directly links the distance from food sources to increased predator activity. Predators are drawn to areas where food is abundant, so being further away from food increases the risk of encountering them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku tamela mintsembyana ya risuna (Tending to stray young animals):** While this could be a factor, the passage doesn't explicitly link young animals straying to increased predator attacks on humans.
*   **B: Ku basisa ekhempeni (Setting up a camp):** Setting up a camp itself doesn't *cause* predators to attack. It's the proximity to food that attracts them.
*   **D: Ku hlongola swiharhi swi swiphemu swa swakudya (Leaving food scraps):** This is *a* cause of attracting predators, but the passage focuses more on the distance from food sources as the primary issue.

Eka leswi landzelaka hi xihi lexi nga boxiwiki eka xiyenge lexi tanihi lexi nga vangelaka ku hlaseriwa hi swiharhi?,"The correct answer is **A: Risema lerikulu** (Large food storage).

Here's why:

The passage discusses the dangers of attracting wildlife with food. It specifically mentions that improperly stored food can attract animals. Therefore, a large, secure food storage is crucial to prevent animals from being drawn to the campsite and potentially becoming a threat.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku tsandzeka ku va ekule na swona** (It becomes crowded with them): While attracting animals can lead to them being around, the primary concern is the safety risk.
*   **C: Ku nyika swiharhi swakudya** (Providing food to them): The passage explicitly warns *against* providing food.
*   **D: Swiharhi leswi nga tolovelangiki vanhu** (Animals that don't bother people): The passage states that even animals that don't typically bother people can be dangerous if attracted to food.
