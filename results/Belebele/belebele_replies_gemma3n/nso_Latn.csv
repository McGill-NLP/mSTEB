"Go ya ka temana ye, ke eng seo se bego se ka se tšewe e le keletšo e nepagetšego ya go bapala accordion ka katlego?","The correct answer is **B: Boloka go šikinyega mo go sa nyakegego go gonyenyane gore o boloke maatla a gago** (Conserve energy by not pushing the bellows unnecessarily to preserve your strength).

Here's why:

The original text emphasizes conserving energy and avoiding excessive force. Option B directly reflects this advice. Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Bakeng sa bophagamo bja modumo, oketša maatla ao o gotlago dinotlelo ka ona** (For a loud sound, apply the force you want for the notes).  This contradicts the overall theme of conserving energy.
* **C: Ela hloko go otla dinoko mola o dutše o boloka seatla sa go iketla** (Be careful to stop when you are sitting and maintain good posture). While posture is important, it's not the primary piece of advice in the provided text.
* **D: Oketša lebelo leo o šomišago di-bellow ka lona go fihlelela bophagamo bjo bo oketšegilego** (Set the level with which you push the bellows to reach a loud volume).  Again, this emphasizes loudness rather than efficient technique.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate reflection of the lesson about playing accordion with ease, focusing on energy conservation.



"
"Ge o bapala accordion, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e tlago go thuša go oketša modumo?","The correct answer is **C: Kgatelelo e nyenyane (Gentle pressure)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that to avoid excessive volume and to play the accordion well, you shouldn't press the keys too hard. It emphasizes using gentle pressure (""kgatelelo e nyenyane""). The passage also compares the accordion to a piano, explaining that unlike a piano, the volume isn't controlled by the force of pressing the keys. It's controlled by the bellows and the amount of pressure on the buttons/keys.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lebelo le legolo (Large bellows)** - While the bellows *do* control volume, a large bellows isn't necessarily the key to achieving a good sound. It's how you *use* the bellows with gentle pressure that matters.
*   **B: Maatla a oketšegilego (Moderate force)** - The text specifically advises *against* moderate force.
*   **D: Tšhišinyo ya palo ya tlase (Low bass register)** -  The register (low or high notes) doesn't directly relate to controlling the overall volume or sound quality in the way the question is asking.



"
Ke ka lebaka la eng diswantšho tšeo di lego thelebišeneng di na le mellwane yeo e segwago?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka gona seswantšho se tlatša sekerini ka moka.**

Here's why:

* **Overscan** is the process of cropping the edges of a video image. This is done to ensure the picture fits perfectly within the television screen. 
* **The question describes overscan as making the picture appear smaller and potentially cutting off parts of the image.** This directly aligns with option B, which states that the picture is ""tlatša sekerini ka moka"" (stretched/cropped to fit the screen).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go dumelela ditlhalošo tša ka fasana (Allows for accurate descriptions):**  Overscan doesn't necessarily improve descriptions; it can distort the image.
* **C: Go dumelela phetolelo ye bonolo go dibopego tše dingwe (Allows for easy conversion to other formats):** Overscan has nothing to do with format conversion.
* **D: Go sega ditlhalošo tša ka fasana kgauswi kudu le tlase (Avoids accurate descriptions at the top and bottom):** While overscan can affect the top and bottom of the image, it's not the primary reason for the cropping; it's the overall process of stretching the image to fit the screen.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mathata afe a a latelago ao motho a ka kopanago le ona ge a fela a fetolela movie go sebopego DVD","The correct answer is **C: Seswantšho seo se tlatšago sekerini ka moka (Overscan)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes overscan as a process used by TVs to ensure the picture fills the screen. This means the edges of the image are often cropped off. When playing a DVD, which doesn't have overscan applied, the image can appear to be cropped, with the edges of the picture potentially being visible or text being cut off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Seswantšho ga se tlatše sekerini ka moka (The picture doesn't fill the screen):** This is the opposite of the problem. The issue *is* that the picture might be overscanned.
* **B: Karolo yeo e segago dithaetlele tša ka fasana (The bottom part of the image is cropped):** While cropping can occur, the passage mentions text being cut off *above* the image, indicating overscan affects the entire image.
* **D: Kgaola mellwane (Neighboring sections):** This is not relevant to the problem of DVD playback and overscan.



"
Naa ke kae moo madira a British garrison a bego a beilwe gona?,"The correct answer is **B: Trenton**.

The text states: ""Madira a hlaselo a banna ba 2,400 a tla tshela noka di mile tše senyane go ya leboa la Trenton..."" which means the attacking force marched north of Trenton. Therefore, the British garrison was located in Trenton.
"
Ke mosaeno wa mang wo o tšweletšego godimo ga sengwalwa sa go ngwalwa ka seatla?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The text explicitly states that the broadsides were printed by John Dunlap at his printing shop.  The other individuals mentioned are involved in the dissemination or reception of the text, but Dunlap is the printer.
"
"Go tšwa mafelong a a latelago, ke kae moo Dunlap broadside e fihlilego gona la mafelelo?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The text states: ""Letlakala le fihlile London ka di 10 Agostose."" (The letter arrived in London on August 10th.)
"
Na mašole a Kolonel Stark a be a le kae?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka pele ga legora**.

The text states: ""Gridley goba Stark ba beile setseka tekano ya maoto a 100 (30 m) pele ga legora..."" which translates to ""Gridley or Stark positioned themselves 100 feet (30 m) before the ridge...""
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo,banna ba Stark ba ile ba katološa legora la bona neng","The correct answer is **A: Ma-Colonist ba ba biditšego gore go dirwe matlafatšo**.

The text states: ""Ma-colonist, ka go bona tiragalo ye, ba ile ba bitša matlafatšo."" (The colonists, seeing this sight, called it a maneuver/improvement).  This indicates that the maneuver began when the colonists decided to undertake it.
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e bego e le nngwe ya mehla ya bošoro kudu ya China?","The correct answer is **D: Mebušo ye meraro ya mehla (Three Kingdoms period)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most bloody historical periods in Ancient China where people fought fiercely to gain power in the grand palace in Xi'an.""

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, the passage directly identifies the Three Kingdoms period as a particularly bloody time.
"
"Go ya ka temana ye,ke therešo efe ka mašole a ditšhošwane tša madira yeo e tsenego legatong la go huduga?","The correct answer is **C: Ba dira dihlaga tšeo di fetošwago ka morago ga matšatši a 17**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Koloni e thoma lemanoga la nomadic ge dijo tša goba gona di fokotšegile. Nakong ya lemanoga le, koloni e dira dihlara tša nakwana tšeo di fetolwago letšatši ka letšatši.""  This directly translates to ""The colony begins with a nomadic lifestyle when food becomes scarce. During the famine, the colony makes temporary shelters that are moved day by day.""  The key is the movement of the shelters daily, implying they are not permanent and are built and dismantled regularly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di bea dihlaga bošego** (They build temporary huts): While this is *part* of what they do, it doesn't explain the *shifting* nature of the shelters.
* **B: Ba na le kabo ya fase ya dijo** (They have a reserve of food): The passage explicitly states that famine occurs *because* food is scarce.
* **D: Ba gwanta mosegare** (They hunt at night): The passage mentions hunting at night, but not as a defining characteristic of their shelter building or nomadic lifestyle. It's just one hunting strategy.



Therefore, option C accurately captures the essence of their shelter building practice – building temporary shelters that are moved daily.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke polelo efe yeo e bontšhago ka nepo mekgwa ya go bea dihlaga ya sešole sa ditšhošwane tša madira nakong ya kgato ya go huduga?","The correct answer is **C: Di fetola sehlaga letšatši ka letšatši**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Nakong ya lemanoga le, koloni e dira dihlara tša nakwana tšeo di fetolwago letšatši ka letšatši."" (During the drought, the colony makes temporary shelters which are changed day by day.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di aga dihlaga bošego** (They build shelters of mud) - While mud might be used, the passage emphasizes *changing* the shelters, not just building them.
* **B: Di gwanta matšatši a 17 ntle le go bea dihlaga** (They wander for 17 days without building shelters) - The passage mentions wandering *during* a drought, and also mentions the creation of shelters.
* **D: Di šomiša dihlaga tše di swanago ka nako ya kgato** (They use the same shelters during the drought) - This contradicts the passage's statement that the shelters are changed daily.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e tlago tšwela pele go sa šetšwe go ba gona ga ditšhupetšo tša ka ntle?,"The correct answer is **C: Sešupanako sa thutaphedi (Phage cycles)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dišupanako tša thutaphedi ke tšeo di kgonago go ipušetša morago tšeo di tlogo tšwetšagopele nako ya tshepetšo ya mahala ya diraleswa le ge dikhues tša ka ntle di sego.""  This translates to: ""Bacteriophages are capable of replicating after the host cell has lysed and external cues are absent.""

This means bacteriophages (phages) are the self-replicating agents that continue to cycle even when external signals are gone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di-cycles tša ka gare (Internal cycles):** While phages *have* internal cycles, the question asks what *starts* to run when external cues are absent.  The phage cycle is the mechanism, not the starting point.
* **B: Merethetho ya nako le nako (Temporal rhythms):** This is too broad. While some biological processes have temporal rhythms, the passage specifically focuses on phage reproduction.
* **D: Merethetho ye e hlokometšwego (Adaptive rhythms):** Similar to B, this is too general and doesn't specifically address phage behavior.



Therefore, **Sešupanako sa thutaphedi (Phage cycles)** is the most accurate answer because it directly aligns with the passage's description of how phages continue to replicate independently of external signals.
"
Ke lereo lefe leo le hlalošago batho bao ba bontšhago diphapano tša seka se itšego sa phenotypic?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** means having multiple forms or variations. The question describes individuals within a population showing different forms of the same trait, which is the definition of polymorphism.
* **Monomorphic** means having only one form.
* **Species** is a broader category referring to a group of organisms that can interbreed.
* **Diphedi** means ""phenotype"" in the context of the question, referring to the observable characteristics of an organism.

Therefore, the individuals exhibiting different phenotypic variations in the same trait are described as **polymorphic**."
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e lego lereo le le nepagetšego la diphedi tšeo di tšeago lefelo le itšego?,"The correct answer is **C: Species**.

Here's why:

* **Species** is defined as a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring.  A key characteristic of a species is having a distinct and relatively consistent genetic makeup.  Therefore, differences in the *shape* of the shell, as described in the prompt, can be a defining characteristic differentiating one species of snail from another.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:** This means having only one form or type. While a monomorphic snail population would have a consistent shell shape, it doesn't define a species.
* **Population:** A population is a group of individuals of the same species living in the same area. While a population *can* be monomorphic or polymorphic, it's not the defining characteristic of a species itself.
* **Polymorphic:** This means having multiple forms or types. A polymorphic snail population would have different shell shapes, but this doesn't necessarily mean it's a separate species.  It could still be one species with variation within it.



Therefore, the distinct shell shape difference between snail populations is most likely indicative of a difference at the species level.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ka se bego mohola wa mošomo wa boeti wo o theilwego godimo ga tlhago?,"The correct answer is **B: Go tšea diswantšho tša matšoba a naga (To search for rare wildlife)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *would not* be a typical job function for someone working with wildlife conservation, as described in the text. The text lists activities like tracking, cleaning up, collecting samples, observing animals, and studying ecosystems.

* **B (Go tšea diswantšho tša matšoba a naga)** aligns with the idea of research and conservation work.  Finding and studying rare wildlife is a key aspect of understanding and protecting populations.
* **A (Go sepela ka maoto go ya phororo)** - Hiking to a research area *could* be part of the job, but it's more of a logistical detail than a core job function.
* **C (Go etela musiamo a mahlale)** - Visiting famous mountains is not directly related to wildlife conservation work.
* **D (Go rea dihlapi ka difofane)** - Cleaning up with a broom is a maintenance task, not typically associated with the primary role of a wildlife conservationist.



Therefore, searching for rare wildlife is the option that is least likely to be a primary job function.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e lego motheo wa tshepedišo ya dinamelwa?","The correct answer is **D: Phetogo ya batho (Human activity)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Le go e thekga, tshepedišo ya dinamelwa go ya ka disafatanaga tša praebete."" (And to support it, the sustainability of resources depends on private sector initiatives.) It then goes on to say: ""Thutomahlale ga bjale e laetša gore ekonomi ye ye kgolo ya carbon e šutišitše biosphere go tšwa go maemong ya yona a makaone ao a thekgilego phetogo ya batho bakeng sa mengwaga ye dimilione tše pedi ya go feta."" (Scientists now believe that the large carbon economy has pushed the biosphere away from its stable state due to human activity for the past two million years.)

This clearly indicates that **human activity** is the driving force behind the need for sustainable resource management. Options A, B, and C are consequences or factors *related* to the problem, but not the core reason for the need for sustainability itself."
Dikarolwana tšeo di dikologago nucleus di na le mohuta ofe wa tšhatšhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Tšhatšhe ye posetifi le ye neketifi**.

Here's why:

* **Protons** have a positive charge.
* **Neutrons** have no charge (neutral).
* **Electrons** have a negative charge.

Therefore, the nucleus contains both positive (protons) and negative (electrons) charges.
"
Nucleus e bopilwe ka dikarolwana tše dife?,"The correct answer is **A: Diprothone le di-neutron**.

The passage states: ""Di nucleus di na le dikarolo tše pedi - di neutrons le di protons."" (Nuclei have two components - neutrons and protons.)
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke fe ya tše di latelago yeo e lego mohlala wa nomoro ya binary ya di bit tše hlano?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **Binary numbers** use only two digits: 0 and 1.
* **The question asks for a 5-bit binary number.** This means it needs to have 5 digits, each being either a 0 or a 1.
* **Let's examine the options:**
    * A: 1010 - This is a 4-bit number.
    * B: 12001 - This is not a binary number (it uses the digit 2).
    * C: 10010 - This is a 5-bit number composed only of 0s and 1s.
    * D: 110101 - This is a 6-bit number.

Therefore, the only option that represents a 5-bit binary number is 10010.
"
Dinomoro tša binary le tšona di bitšwa eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Di bits**.

Here's why:

* **Bits** are the fundamental units of information in computing and digital communication. They represent binary digits (0 or 1). The question explicitly mentions ""di nomoro tša bobedi - goba diripana"" which translates to binary digits/bits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Boleng (Volume):**  Volume is a measure of space. It has nothing to do with binary numbers.
* **Polelo ya dikhomphuta (Computer language):** Computer language is a set of instructions, not the fundamental unit of data itself.
* **Diforomo (Forms):**  Forms are structures for data entry, not related to binary digits.



"
Ke fe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa bolelwago temaneng bjalo ka mohola wa mathomo wa go ngwala diboloko tša baithuti?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaonafatšo ya popopolelo le bokgoni bja go ngwala.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that online tools can improve writing proficiency and ability. It mentions that students often copy and paste from the internet, and these tools can help them move beyond that. This directly relates to improving writing skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Go fokotšega ga go swaiwa diphošo go tšwa go dithaka:** While online tools can *help* reduce plagiarism, the passage doesn't say it automatically happens or that it's the primary reason for using them.
* **C: Temogo yeo e katološitšwego ya tikologo:** The passage doesn't focus on environmental technology.
* **D: Kganyogo e oketšegilego ya go tšwela pele go ithuta:** While online tools can support continued learning, the immediate benefit highlighted is writing improvement.

Therefore, the most directly supported answer in the passage is the improvement of writing proficiency and ability.
"
Ke efe ya dikarolo tše di latelago tša go ngwala diboloko yeo e tsopolwago bjalo ka tlhohleletšo ya baithuti go kaonafatša mabokgoni a bona a go ngwala?,"The correct answer is **B: Kganyoga ya go phema go swaiwa diphošo (Collaboration to prevent plagiarism)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ka ge baithuti e le ba bogedi bao bantši ba swayago diphošo, mongwadi wa mokero wa inthanethe o lwela go kaonafatša go ngwala go efoga go swaiwa diphošo."" (Since students are often prone to plagiarism, the online project leader strives to improve writing to avoid plagiarism.)

Option B directly addresses this struggle with plagiarism and how online tools can help prevent it through collaboration. The other options are mentioned in the text, but option B is the most direct answer to the question about how online tools improve writing skills related to the prompt.



Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kgafetšakgafetša go arabela didirišwa mo inthaneteng (Enhancing the ability to interact with online resources):** While online tools *do* enhance interaction, the core focus of the text regarding writing skill improvement is about plagiarism and collaborative writing, not just resource interaction.
*   **C: Go boloka kgahlego ya batheetši ba bona (Maintaining student integrity):** Integrity is a result of preventing plagiarism, but the text's direct focus isn't simply on maintaining integrity; it's on the process of *improving writing* to prevent plagiarism.
*   **D: Go nyakega ga tirišano (The need for networking):** Networking isn't a primary benefit of online writing tools as described in the text. Collaboration to prevent plagiarism is a much stronger point.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer because it directly corresponds to the text's emphasis on tackling plagiarism through online collaboration."
Ke fe ya tše di latelago yeo e sego mohola poledišano ya asynchronous go baithuti? ,"The correct answer is **D: Taolo ya lebelo (Control of pace)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication ""dumelela baithuti bokgone bja go šoma ka lebelo la bona le go laola lebelo la tsebešo ya ditaelo"" (allows students to work at their own pace and control the timing of the learning process). This is a key benefit of asynchronous learning.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Tšhomišo ya kgahlego bjalo ka mothopo (Personalized feedback):** While feedback is valuable, it's not *specifically* a defining characteristic *sego mohola* (not inherently) of asynchronous communication. Feedback can be provided synchronously or asynchronously.
*   **B: Phihlelelo ya go lebana le sefahlego go ya go mohlahli ka nako efe goba efe ya letšatši (Opportunity for face-to-face interaction with the instructor at any time or day):** This is a characteristic of *synchronous* communication, not asynchronous.
*   **C: Diiri tša mošomo tše di fetofetogago (Flexible work schedules):** Flexible work schedules are related to pacing, but the passage focuses more directly on the *control* of that pacing.



Therefore, the ability to control one's own pace is the most defining characteristic *sego mohola* of asynchronous communication highlighted in the passage."
"Go ya ka setsopolwa, ke efe ya dikarolo tše di latelago ya kgokagano ya asynchronous yeo e sa fetofetogego go baithuti?","The correct answer is **B: Diiri tša mošomo (Workload)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes asynchronous learning as allowing students to work at their own pace and manage their learning schedule.  This directly relates to the **workload** being distributed and managed by the student. The other options are mentioned as *enablers* of asynchronous learning, but not the core *result* or characteristic the question is asking about.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Lebelo la go ithuta (Learning Pace):** While asynchronous learning *allows* for self-paced learning, the question asks about a *characteristic* of the asynchronous learning itself, not the ability to learn at a pace.
*   **C: Didirišwa tša taetšo (Visual Aids):**  Visual aids can be used in *any* learning environment, not specifically defining asynchronous learning.
*   **D: Tšhomišo ya inthanete (Online Resources):** Online resources are a *tool* that facilitates asynchronous learning, but not the defining characteristic.



"
Ke eng seo se sa bolelwago temaneng ye bjalo ka selo seo motho a ka se tswalanyago le dibo tša mehleng tša magareng?,"The correct answer is **A: Melete ya kgolego/ Dungeon**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a medieval castle with features like jousts, feasts, and Arthurian paraphernalia. It mentions the castle's role in gaining fame and attracting knights, referencing a golden age and advanced technology.  However, the question asks what's *not* true about such a place in the medieval period.  

* **Dungeons** were a common feature of medieval castles, used for imprisonment. The description of advanced technology and attracting knights with ""golden age"" status doesn't fit with the typical reality of a medieval dungeon.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible features of a medieval castle:

* **Jousts:**  Were a popular form of entertainment for knights in medieval times.
* **Feasts:**  Knights and nobility often held lavish feasts in their castles.
* **Bazaars of weapons:** Castles were often centers for the production and trade of weapons.
* **Castles:**  Were obviously central to medieval life, serving as residences and defensive structures.



Therefore, the most unrealistic element described in the passage, and thus the answer to what's *not* true, is the implied advanced technology and the ""golden age"" attracting knights. This deviates from the historical reality of what medieval castles were like, which is more akin to the description of a dungeon.



"
Ke fe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa bolelwago temaneng ye bjalo ka monkgo goba modumo wo o ka loyago gare ga marope a mošate?,"The correct answer is **B: Letšhogo (Shield)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes medieval castles as centers of tournaments, feasts, and Arthurian festivities. It mentions the importance of castles in gaining fame and fortune, thanks to the power they represented and the defenses they offered.

The question asks what is *unusual* to find in such a castle. While all the options could *potentially* be found in some form, a **shield** is the most unexpected. Here's the reasoning:

* **Dintwa (Weapons):** Weapons would definitely be found in a castle, especially one associated with tournaments.
* **Menyanya (Food):** Feasts were a central part of castle life, so food would be common.
* **Ditlhako tša ditlhako (Mining/Ore):** Castles often relied on nearby mines for resources.
* **Letšhogo (Shield):** While shields are weapons, they are often considered more of a defensive item and less central to the image of a grand, celebratory castle than, say, a sword or a lance.  The passage emphasizes the spectacle of tournaments and the glory of the knight, which are often portrayed with more offensive weaponry.

Therefore, a shield stands out as the least expected item to prominently display in a castle dedicated to fame, fortune, and spectacular events.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e lego tlhalošo e nepagetšego ya mošate wa Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **D: E bee agilwe bakeng sa go tšwetša pele ditlhaselo tše telele le tše di ikemišeditšego** (It was built to advance long-range and strategic defenses).

Here's why:

* The passage states the large windows and thick walls were designed to prevent long-range attacks. This indicates the castle was intended for defense against more serious threats, not just minor raids.
* Options A and B are incorrect. While Lord Hastings may have been involved, the passage doesn't specify why the towers were built. Option B is also incorrect because a small garrison wouldn't necessitate such a substantial structure.
* Option C is incorrect. The passage says the castle was *unusual* for its time, implying it was built with a specific purpose beyond typical castle construction.

Therefore, option D best reflects the passage's emphasis on the castle's defensive capabilities against long-range attacks and strategic defense.



"
Ke fe ya dikarolo tše di latelago tša go aga yeo e ka tšewago e le yeo e sa tlwaelegago bakeng sa mošate wa Kirby Muxloe nakong ya nako yeo e hlalošitšwego temaneng?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebo se senyenyane seo se agilwego go tšwetša pelo ditlhaselo (Small loop inserted to counter siege weaponry)**.

The passage explicitly states that the large windows and small arrow slits wouldn't allow siege weaponry to effectively target the building. The addition of a small loop to counter siege weaponry is a key unusual feature designed for defense during the time of construction.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ka holago kudu go mokitimi ka go itokišetša sehla se setlago?","The correct answer is **B: Go tsepamiša kgopolo go hlagolela lebelo ge o dutše o itlwaetša (Focusing on breathing to manage expectations while you train).**

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that a mile swim is challenging and requires mental fortitude alongside physical ability. Option B directly addresses the mental aspect of managing expectations and focusing on breathing during the swim. This is crucial for endurance and preventing early fatigue.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go tlwaetša go kitima go tshela naga ka lehlabula (Getting used to swimming in the water with a relaxed attitude):** While relaxation is helpful, the text focuses more on the *challenge* of the mile swim, not just getting comfortable in the water.
* **C: Go betha nako ya metsotso ye meraro (Spending three minutes):** This is simply a time duration and doesn't address the core issue of mental strategy.
* **D: Go diriša lefelo la go itšhidulla go šoma ka godimo ga mmele (Using the pull buoy to work on the upper body):** The text mentions gym work for the upper body, but the pull buoy is a specific tool, and the primary emphasis is on the mental and breathing aspects of the swim itself.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e lego bohlokwa kudu go mokitimi wa maemo a pele a di-mile?","The correct answer is **A: Go ya ka go itlwaetša go selaganya le naga go kitima ka dikgwedi tša marega (Gradually increase running distance over weeks)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that a beginner mile runner shouldn't expect to achieve a fast time right away. The key is gradual progression and building endurance.  Option A directly reflects this principle.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go hlagolela kgotlelelo go feta lebelo (Exceeding the expected time)** -  The passage explicitly warns against this.
* **C: Go tsena ka tlase ga metsotso e mebedi (Starting under two minutes)** - This is unrealistic for a beginner and not the focus of the passage.
* **D: Go hlagolela lebelo go feta kgotlelelo (Exceeding the pace over the time)** - This is also not a key focus; the passage is more concerned with distance.



"
"Go moatlelete, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ka se fihlelelwego fela ka mekgwa ya phepo?","The correct answer is **D: Bophelo bjo bobotse bja kakaretšo (Complete healthy life)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that even with good health practices, athletes might not be able to achieve *complete* health, especially regarding injuries.  It specifically mentions ""go oketša go ipshina ga bona ka papadi"" (avoiding complete immobility). This implies that some level of physical limitation or risk remains.

* Options A, B, and C (perfect recovery, overcoming mountain obstacles, and reaching peak performance) are all goals that athletes actively strive for *through* healthy practices and training. While challenging, they are within the realm of possibility, even if not always guaranteed. Complete health is a more holistic and perhaps unattainable ideal.



Therefore, complete healthy life is the most challenging goal, as it encompasses not just physical well-being, but also potential lingering effects of training and injury, which the passage highlights.

"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa šišinywago bjalo ka tsela ya gore baatlelete ba bafsa ba hwetše boithabišo bjo bo oketšegilego papading ya bona?","The correct answer is **B: Go tšwela pele ka go se fetoge go dira maemong a maemo a godimo (Progressive overload)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes gradual increases in training intensity.** It states that a fitness program can't *suddenly* improve health, but helps maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent injuries by gradually adapting to the body's needs.
* **Progressive overload** is the principle of gradually increasing the demands on your body during exercise. This could mean increasing weight, reps, sets, or decreasing rest time. This gradual increase is key to continued improvement and avoiding overtraining.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go itlwaetša phepo ye e swanetšego (Maintaining a proper diet):**  While important for overall health and fitness, the passage focuses more on the *training program itself* as the key to improvements and injury prevention.
* **C: Hydrating ka mo go atlegilego (Hydrating quickly):** Hydration is necessary, but the passage doesn't highlight rapid hydration as a primary factor for long-term success.
* **D: Go boloka tekatekano ya maatla ye e phetšego gabotse (Maintaining a consistent level of energy):** Energy levels are important, but the passage is about the training *program* and *gradual adaptation*.

"Go ya ka temana ye, ke ka lebaka la eng mokitimi wa bokgole bja magareng a ka reka sedirišwa se se bitšago kudu?","The correct answer is **D: Go na le dikgopolo tšeo di fošagetšego tšeo di dikologilego didirišwa tšeo di sa bitšego kudu.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go na le dikgopolo tše dintši tše di fošagetšego mabapi le diripa tše mmalwa tše sedirišwa seo se nyakegago go tšea karolo. Dibapadi di ka ikwela di nyaka setšweletšwa le ge se sa tšweletši meputso ya nnete.""  This translates to: ""There are many rumors about the effectiveness of certain components needed to make the desired product. Producers can choose to be cautious even if they don't have full proof."" 

The question asks *why* a goldsmith might choose to buy a less common product. The passage directly supports the idea that they might do this *because of rumors* (dikgopolo) surrounding its effectiveness. Options A, B, and C don't align with the information given.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo didirišwa tša go kitima bokgole bja magareng di se nyakago?","The correct answer is **A: Didirišwa tše dintši (Many tools)**.

The text explicitly states: ""go na le dikgopolo tše dintši tše di fošagetšego mabapi le diripa tše mmalwa tše sedirišwa seo se nyakegago go tšea karolo"" which translates to ""there are many rumors about the tools that are needed to play that game"".  It further emphasizes that these tools can be bought when needed, but many people prefer to have a small herd or keep them in a specific place for security.

Therefore, the text indicates a need for *many tools* to play the game.
"
Ke mang yo a ilego a utolla go kwagala ga makenete wa nuclear? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch le Purcell**.

The text states: ""MRI e ikeme ka karolo ya physics yeo e bitšwago modumo wa magnete wa nuclear (NMR), yeo e hweditšwego ka bo 1930 ke Felix Bloch (a bereka Yunibesithi ya Stanford) lr Edward Purcell (wa go tšwa Yunibesithi ya Havard).""  This clearly indicates that both Bloch and Purcell discovered Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.
"
Ke ngwageng ofe mo go ilego gwa newa tokelo ya mathomo ya go dira dilo tša kalafo bakeng sa resonance ya go tšea diswantšho tša kalafo? ,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

The passage states: ""1977, Ngk. Damaduan o feditše go dira tebeledišišo ya pele ya """"""mmele-ka moka"""""""", yeo a e biditšego """"""Indomitable""""""."" This refers to Damadian's first prototype of an MRI machine.  The question asks when the first patent for functional medical imaging was obtained, and the text explicitly links 1977 to this event.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo batho ba swanetšego go ba le kwešišo ye e tiilego ka sona gore ba kgone go hlatholla ditiro tša mmele wa ba bangwe?","The correct answer is **B: Maikemišetšo (Empathy)**.

Here's why:

* **Empathy** is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. The passage explicitly states that understanding the intentions, motivations, and feelings of others is crucial for understanding their body language and behavior. This aligns perfectly with the definition of empathy.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Kganyogo (Trust):** While trust is important in relationships, it doesn't directly relate to understanding someone's actions.
* **Tumelo (Faith):** Faith is primarily related to belief in something spiritual or religious, and not applicable to understanding human behavior.
* **Temogo (Language):**  While body language can be interpreted like a language, the passage emphasizes *understanding the feelings behind the actions*, which goes beyond simply knowing the 'language' of body language.

Therefore, empathy is the most accurate answer based on the passage's emphasis on understanding others' intentions and feelings to interpret their body language.



"
"Go ya ka temana, go kwešiša maikemišetšo go thuša batho go dira eng?","The correct answer is **C: Lebelela batho ba bangwe ntle le kahlolo** (Observe others without judgment).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding others' motivations and intentions.** This understanding helps us avoid jumping to conclusions based on superficial observations.
* **Option C aligns perfectly with this idea.** Observing without judgment allows us to consider various possibilities and avoid making assumptions about people's actions. 
* **The passage specifically contrasts interpreting someone stealing with understanding they might be trying to get something for themselves.** This highlights the importance of understanding context and motives, rather than immediate judgement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fediša go se kgonthišege ka morago ga ditiro tša mmele** (Avoid being offended after bodily actions) - While being less offended is good, it's not the core benefit of understanding intentions.
* **B: Bolela e sa le ka pele dikganyogo** (Listen before being judgmental) - This is related, but observation is a broader part of understanding intentions. The passage focuses on the importance of observing and interpreting, not just listening.
* **D: Bala menagano ya ba bangwe** (Read the minds of others) - The passage makes it clear that it's *understanding intentions* (maikemišetšo), not reading minds.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e lego kakaretšo ye e nepagetšego ya morero o mogolo wa AI?","The answer is **A: Go rulaganya (Planning)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes AI as a field that involves creating algorithms to enable machines to perform tasks requiring expertise. It mentions tasks like control, calculation, analysis, and understanding language, speech, and facial expressions.  This all points to a structured process – **planning** – required to develop AI systems.  Before any algorithms can be written or data analyzed, there needs to be a plan outlining the goals, approach, and resources needed.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Temogo ya lentšu (Language Model):** While language models are *part* of AI, they are not the overarching plan. They are a specific *application* of AI techniques.
* **C: Go beakanya nako (Time Analysis):** Time analysis is important for *optimizing* AI systems, but it doesn't represent the initial, comprehensive plan.
* **D: Mošomo wa go itiriša (Execution Work):** Execution is the final stage *after* planning and development. It's not the plan itself.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo AI gantši e tswalanywago le yona?","The correct answer is **C: Dikanegelo tša mahlale (Knowledge representation)**.

Here's why:

The text states that AI involves creating mechanisms to enable machines to perform tasks requiring expertise. It then lists examples like:

*   Control
*   Estimation
*   Reasoning
*   Responding to customer inquiries
*   Recognizing writing, speech, and faces

These capabilities all fall under the umbrella of **knowledge representation**.  AI systems need to be able to *represent* knowledge in a way that allows them to reason and perform these tasks.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Tirelo ya bareki (Customer service)**: While AI *can* be used for customer service (responding to inquiries), it's one specific application, not the core area AI is typically paired with.
*   **B: Go rulaganya le beakanya nako (Scheduling and planning)**:  This is another application of AI, but not the fundamental area it interacts with.
*   **D: Temogo ya mongwalo wa seatla (Machine learning model)**: Machine learning is a *method* used *within* AI to achieve knowledge representation and other tasks, but it's not what AI is typically *paired with*. Knowledge representation is a higher-level concept.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e lego maatla a motho yo a nago le mekgwa ya go nagana yeo e kopanago?","The correct answer is **B: Go diriša dithekniki tše di mpsha bothateng (Using effective techniques in problem-solving)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a problem-solving approach that involves:

* **Expectation, analysis, and planning:**  (Lebeo, go ganana le go nepa)
* **Knowing the facts:** (Go tseba dintlha)
* **Using techniques:** (Go diriša gape mekgwa)
* **Gathering information:** (Go kgoboketša tsebišo)

Option B directly aligns with this, as ""effective techniques in problem-solving"" refers to the ""mekgwa"" (techniques) mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Go šupa dikarabo tše dintši tše di nepagetšego tša bothata (Generating many correct solutions to a problem):** While having a good problem-solving approach *can* lead to many correct solutions, the passage emphasizes finding *the single, correct solution* – not generating multiple ones.
* **C: Go ipha nako ya bona ya go rarolla mathata (Taking their time to solve problems):**  The passage doesn't mention taking time as a defining characteristic, although careful analysis might necessitate it.
* **D: Go swara ka hlogo dipaterone (Avoiding patterns in thinking):** The passage actually describes people with this problem-solving approach as being *good at recognizing patterns* (go gopola diphethene).



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa tšeego e le nepo ya monagano wa go nagana wo o kopanago?","The correct answer is **A: Go ya ka kwešišo ya gore go na le karabo e tee fela ye e nepagetšego.**

The passage explicitly states: ""O ka nagana ka dikarabo tše pedi fela, tšeo e le go yeo e nepagetšego le yeo e fošagetšego. Mohuta wo wa go nagana o tswalantšwa le saentshea itšego goba tshepedišo ya go tlwaelega. Batho ba goba le mohuta wo wa go gopola ba na megopolo ya go kwagala, ba kgona go gopola diphethene, go rarabolla mathata le go šoma ka diteko tša thutahlale."" This directly relates to the idea of believing there's only one correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tšea nako ya motho:** While time management can be helpful, it's not the core characteristic described in the passage regarding problem-solving thinking.
* **C: Go hlaola dintlha:** Data management is important, but the passage focuses on the *way* someone approaches problems, not just handling data.
* **D: Go kgoboketšo tshedimošo:** Information processing is part of the broader thinking process, but not the defining characteristic outlined in the text.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ka se tšewego ele polelo e nyenyane?","The correct answer is **B: Go šošobanya phatla (To twitch rapidly)**.

Here's why:

The passage talks about noticing subtle movements, like twitching, that can indicate something. The sentence ""Kudu-kudu, go thwe motho a ka gona go bona ge eba motho o bolela maaka ka go hlatholla ditlhagišo tše nnyane gabotse"" means ""In short, one can see a person sneeze by observing the smallest movements.""  ""Go šošobanya phatla"" (to twitch rapidly) is the most fitting example of a subtle movement that could be observed to detect something.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Go gadima kgole ge o dutše o bolela (To get cold when sitting and talking):** This is unrelated to subtle movements or detecting information.
*   **C: Go panyapanya ka lebelo (To nod expectantly):** This is a deliberate action, not a subtle movement.
*   **D: Gofa monwana o mogolo godimo (To lift an older child up):** This is a physical action with no connection to observing subtle movements.



"
Naa ke efe ya dipolelo tše di latelago mabapi le tlhathollo tša polelo ye nnyane yeo e sego ya nnete?,"The correct answer is **C: Polelo gammogo le ponagalo ya sefahlego di a hlathollwa (Speech and facial expressions are analyzed)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how technology is being developed to analyze subtle cues in speech and facial expressions to help diagnose conditions like autism and other developmental issues.  Option C directly reflects this, stating that both speech *and* facial expressions are being analyzed.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Dikgatišo tša di video di lebišitše tšwelopeleng e kgolo (Video recordings have led to significant development):** While video recordings are important, the passage is about the *analysis* of these recordings, not just the recordings themselves.
*   **B: Tlhathollo ye e nepagetšego e ka lemoga maaka (Accurate analysis can reveal signs):** This is true, but it doesn't specify *what* is being analyzed.
*   **D: E ka thuša go hlahloba potego (It can help to check for deception):** The passage doesn't mention deception. It focuses on developmental and neurological conditions.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ilego ya ba bohlokwa kudu ka baka la tsošološo? ,"The correct answer is **C: Go gopola sengwalwa (Remembering writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Go be go se sana kgathelelo ka gare ga go kgopotšo ya batho, efela bokgone bja go gopola dingwalwa bo bile bjoo o elwago šedi le go feta.""  This translates to: ""There was no emphasis on the memory of people, only the ability to remember writing became the dominant and surpassing one.""

Therefore, the ability to remember writing is highlighted as the key change brought about by the revolution.  The other options are mentioned, but not as the *primary* shift in focus.
"
"Ka lebaka la tsošološo, go gatelelwa kudu go tšweleditšwe go tše dife tše di latelago?","The correct answer is **D: Go abelana ka tshemošo (Sharing information)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the advent of the printing press (Tsošološo) led to a significant change in how learning and knowledge were acquired.  It emphasizes the shift from relying solely on oral tradition (memory of people) to the ability to **read and disseminate written information**.

Therefore, the logical next step after having access to written information is to **share that information** with others.  While options A, B, and C are related to learning, they are not the *direct* consequence highlighted by the passage's emphasis on the printing press enabling widespread written materials.  Sharing the information is the most natural progression.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa bontšhego tlhohleletšo ya go šomiša inthanete go tšwetša pele dikamano?,"The answer is **A: Go dira dikgokagano tša kgwebo (Conducting business transactions)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how the internet facilitates the *formation and maintenance of relationships*. It specifically mentions ""being present"" and ""lasting relationships"" as research findings. 

Let's look at the options:

*   **A: Go dira dikgokagano tša kgwebo:** While the internet *can* be used for business, the passage doesn't explicitly link business transactions to relationship building. It's more focused on social interaction and connection.
*   **B: Go dula o ikgokaganya le lapa:**  This is a clear example of using the internet to maintain relationships with family.
*   **C: Maeto a go dira nyakišišo:**  This relates to research and finding information, which could indirectly contribute to relationships (e.g., researching shared interests with someone), but it's less direct than the other options.
*   **D: Go kopana le batho ba mpsha:**  This is a direct example of forming new relationships through online interaction.

Therefore, conducting business transactions is the option that is least directly related to the passage's core theme of the internet fostering relationships.

"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa bontšhego tlhohleletšo ya go šomiša inthanete bakeng sa go kgatha tema ga motho ka noši?,"The correct answer is **D: Go laola ditšhelete (Managing finances)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions ""go ithuta"" (learning) and ""dipoledišano tša segwera"" (casual communication) as examples of online activity related to ""go ba gona ka noši"" (being social) and ""dikamano tšeo di tšwelagopele"" (maintaining relationships).  These are directly related to social interaction and emotional well-being.

Let's look at why the other options are *more* likely to be related to online activities that might *not* directly address emotional well-being:

*   **A: Go nyakana le motswako (Shopping and entertainment):** While these can be enjoyable, they aren't *specifically* highlighted as related to social or emotional well-being in the provided text.
*   **B: Go romela ka boto ya poledišano ya inthaneteng (Sending emails):**  Email *can* be a form of social connection and is explicitly mentioned as a part of online interaction, even if it's not the primary focus.
*   **C: Go nyakišiša ditšweletšwa tša tlhokomelo ya maphelo (Accessing health information):** While health is important, accessing health information online is more related to physical well-being than emotional well-being in the context of the text.

Therefore, managing finances is the option least related to the core theme of online activities supporting emotional well-being, as presented in the text.

The passage states: ""go ya mafelelong a Mengwaga ya Magareng bodikela bja Yuropa bo thomile go tšweletša mokgwa wa bona ba nnoši.""  This translates to ""towards the end of the Middle Ages, European art began to develop its own style.""
"
Go diriša dikonopi go kgorometša diaparo e bile mafelelo a eng? ,"The correct answer is **D: Mengwaga ya magareng**.

The passage states: ""...batho ba thomile go šomiša dikonupi go konupela dikobo **batho ba thomile go šomiša dikonupi go konupela dikobo**. Nako ya Gothic..."". This indicates that the introduction of the codex (a book made of bound pages) is associated with the Middle Ages (Mengwaga ya Magareng).

"Go ya ka temana ye, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e tšewago e le tharollo ye e šomago ya nako ye telele ya ditaba tša tikologo?","The correct answer is **A: Go tsenelela dikgetho tša mokgwa wa bophelo tše di feteletšego (Adopting diverse lifestyle choices)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that we can ""enter the 'court of life'"" (i.e., make choices) and become ""advocates to reduce future discomfort."" It also highlights that the world has changed drastically due to technological advancements and population growth, leading to environmental problems. 

The passage emphasizes that if we *don't* want a quick fix, we need to **identify the root cause and address it**. The core message implies that a long-term solution involves changing our lifestyles to be more sustainable and less damaging to the environment.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Boikgafo (Education):** While important, education alone isn't a *solution*. It's a prerequisite for making informed choices, but the action of making choices is what's needed.
*   **C: Go šupa hlolo sa ditaba (Monitoring news):** Monitoring news helps us *understand* the problem, but it doesn't *solve* it.
*   **D: Go ba modirišani wa mokgahlo wa tikologo (Becoming an environmental manager):** This is a valuable career path, but it's not a solution for *everyone*. The passage implies a solution accessible to all through personal choices.



Therefore, adopting diverse lifestyle choices is the most comprehensive and widely applicable long-term solution presented in the passage."
"Go ya ka temana, ke ditharollo dife tše di latelago tšeo di ka se tšewego e le kalafo ya dika tša ditaba tša tikologo?","The best answer is **C: Go ntšha dikgopolo mabapi le dikgetho tša mokgwa wa bophelo tše di feteletšego.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the need to understand the root cause of environmental problems.** It states that changes in technology and population, as well as lifestyle choices, are driving these problems.
* **Option C directly addresses this by advocating for exploring diverse lifestyle choices.**  This implies researching and adopting more sustainable practices. This is a proactive approach to mitigating environmental impact.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **A: Go tsenela boikgafo (Seeking information/Education):**  While education is *important*, it's not a direct *solution* in the same way that changing behavior is. It's a prerequisite for finding solutions.
* **B: Go thibela dihlolo tša modu wa ditaba (Avoiding news analysis):** This is counterproductive. Understanding the news is essential to understanding the problem.
* **D: Go phela ka tsela yeo e sa senyetšego tikologo kudu (Living in a less environmentally impactful way):** This is too vague.  ""Less environmentally impactful"" doesn't offer concrete steps. It lacks the proactive exploration of options suggested by Option C.



Therefore, Option C most closely aligns with the passage's emphasis on understanding the cause and actively seeking alternative approaches through lifestyle choices.

Ke nageng efe yeo e bilego ntwa ya mathomo kua Yuropa yeo go bego go thwe taba ya yona e bohlokwa e tswalana le tekatekano ya maatla go e na le go ba le boemo bja bodumedi?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

The passage states: ""Ntwa ya Hlatlamo ya Spain e swaile ntwa ya pele yeo tabakgolo ya yona ebe e le tekatekano ya maatla."" (The Spanish Reconquista marked the first major shift towards a balance of power.)
"
Ke ntwa efe yeo ka dinako tše dingwe e hlalošwago e le ntwa ya mafelelo ya ‘ bodumedi’?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntwa ya mengwaga’ ye masometharo (The Thirty Years' War)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ntwa ya Mengwaga ye Masometharo e ka ba ntwa ya mafelelo ya go bitšwa ntwa ya sedumedi."" (The Thirty Years' War could be considered the final war to be called the ""second Thirty Years' War""). This refers to the period after the Thirty Years' War, where the balance of power in Europe shifted significantly.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ntwa ya mengwaga’ ye lekgolo (The Great War):** This is a generic term and not specifically mentioned in the text as the final war of balance.
*   **C: Ntwa ya go atlega ya Spanish (The Spanish War of Independence):** While the Spanish War of Independence was important, it's not presented as the final war defining the end of the balance of power. The text identifies the Spanish Armada as the first significant challenge to European power.
*   **D: Ntwa ya selegae ya Spanish (The Spanish Civil War):** This is too specific and a later event than what is being discussed in the passage."
Ke dibopego dife tše di latelago tša kereke ya Catholic tšeo di bego di sa lekolwe?,"The answer is **B: Ge e ba dithuto tše dikgolo tša bodumedi di swanetše go fetošwa.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ye tee ya bodumedi bja ba-Kreste ke gore lehumo le swanetše go šomišwa go fokotša go sokola le go hlaka le gore ditefelelo tša mašeleng a kereke di goba ka lebaka leo.""  This translates to: ""That Christian doctrine is that charity should be practiced to reduce greed and clarity so that the achievements of the Church's members are due to that.""

This implies that there were discrepancies or issues with the *application* of core Christian teachings, specifically the doctrine of charity.  Therefore, the doctrines themselves needed to be reinterpreted or adjusted to align with the principle of charity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ge e le gore kabo ya lehumo ka gare ga kereke e be e le ya maleba:** While greed was a problem, the text focuses more on *how* the doctrine of charity should be applied, not just the existence of greed.
*   **C: Go tsinkela ka maatla ka gare ga kereke:** The text mentions power, but doesn't explicitly say it was a problem that needed to be addressed through force within the Church.
*   **D: Ge nkabe dithuto tše kgolo tša kereke di be di fihlelelwa:**  The text doesn't specifically mention that the doctrines were being manipulated.

"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo a bolailwego kua Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Mohlokomedi**.

The text states: ""le bakeng le lengwe leloko la sehlopa le tšikintšitše hlogo ya mohlokomedi wa mošate yo a bolailwego ka pele ga Mmakgoši wo a bego a tšhogile kudu."" This translates to ""and for another reason, the group smashed the head of the royal guard who had been killed before the Queen and was very frightened.""

The passage states that the King, Queen, and their children were compelled to return to Paris by a group of women. The other options are not explicitly mentioned as part of that specific forced journey.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go bulwa ga mafasetere a bona a dikoloi** (The burning of their carriages): While the revolution later involved destruction of property, the passage doesn't mention this happening during this particular forced return.
* **B: Go tšwa ka tšhoganetšo kua Versailles** (Leaving Versailles in an orderly fashion): The passage clearly states they were *compelled* to leave, not in an orderly fashion.
* **C: Go lebelela ga go kgaotšwa ga dihlogo tša mohlokomedi** (The expectation of the removal of the heads of officials): While there was anger towards officials, the passage mentions the execution of the guard captain, not a general expectation of removing officials' heads.

Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e bego e se mafelelo a ntwa ya Britian ya madira a ka lewatleng yeo e sa tlwaelegago?,"The correct answer is **B: Dikepe tšeo di sa akaretšwago di ile tša beiwa tseleng ye kotsi.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Britain started inspecting German ships *after* the sinking of several ships.  The passage also mentions that Germany responded by ordering its ships to sail in a more dangerous way. This implies that Germany's response was to take risks and navigate more perilously, making the situation more dangerous for everyone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kganyogo ya Germany ya go diriša maano ao a swanago a ntwa** - The passage doesn't mention Germany planning to use similar submarine tactics.
*   **C: Diphetogo di ile tša dirwa molaong wa ditšhabatšhaba** - The passage says Britain violated international law, not that changes were made to it.
*   **D: Dilwana tše bohlokwa di be di sa fihlelelege** - The passage doesn't say important battles were unreachable.



"
Ke polelo efe yeo e sa hlalošego ka tsela yeo go nepagetšego go thibelwa ga madira a ka lewatleng a Britain kgahlanong le Germany?,"The correct answer is **A: E ile kgahlanong le molao wa boditšhabatšhaba (It went against international law)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Britain's blockade ""sentše melao ya ditšhabatšhaba ya go amogelega ya go akaretšwa ka gare ga ditumelelano tša ditšabatšhaba tša mengwagakgolo ye mebedi"" (violated the accepted rules of international law as outlined in long-standing international treaties).
* Options B, C, and D are not directly mentioned or supported by the text. The text focuses on the violation of international law and the process of inspecting ships, not on sinking submarines, disrupting German war effort, or creating risks for ships not complying.



Therefore, option A is the only one directly and accurately reflected in the provided text."
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke mang yo a ka lemogago ka bolwetši bjo bja Multiple Sclerosis bo ka go direga kudu?","The correct answer is **A: Mosadi wa mengwaga ye 32**.

"Go ya ka temana ye, batšeakarolo mo tiragalong ya ka mehla ba nyaka thekgo ye ntši mabapi le eng?","The correct answer is **A: Temogo ye mpe ye bohloko (Fearful bad news)**.

This translates to: ""Those who want to participate in daily events have needed support due to the bad fearful expectation of communicating alarming news about the spread of the flu and its prevention, and they have been very upset by things that are beyond the usual.""  Therefore, the ""temogo ye mpe ye bohloko"" (fearful bad news) is what they need support with.

The passage states: ""Papadi ya sebjalebjale ya go bitšwa fencing e ralokwa mamanogeng a mantši, go tšwa go baithuti ba ithuta yunibesiti go ya go setsebi le phadišano ya Olympic.""  This means fencing is practiced in many places, *from university students to professionals and Olympic competitions*. However, the question asks *where* fencing is practiced *most*. The passage emphasizes its prevalence as a general sport.

The other options are too specific:

* **B: Maemong a yunibesithi** - While fencing is practiced at universities, it's not where it's practiced *most*.
* **C: Maemong a di Olympic** -  Olympic competitions are a high-level venue, but not where fencing is practiced by most.
* **D: Ka sebopego sa gabedi** - This refers to the two main ways fencing is practiced (individual and team), not the location.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided text."
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ka bago sešupo se maatla kudu sa mpholo wa ka gare?","The correct answer is **C: Go tšhošwa go gogolo le bohloko bja ka mpeng (Emotional distress and anxiety)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes signs of a potential internal problem with a pet, including unusual behavior and potential chemical exposure. While physical care (B) is important, and following vet instructions (D) is crucial, the question asks about the *most powerful* impact on the pet's health *according to the text*. The text doesn't directly mention physical ailments but highlights the potential for behavioral changes linked to internal issues.  

The passage implies a more serious underlying issue, and the most significant impact on a pet's well-being, stemming from such issues, is often emotional distress and anxiety.  The other options are more about basic care and treatment, not the potential core problem described in the initial paragraph.  

Option A (feeding and exercise) and B (cleaning and grooming) are important but are secondary to addressing a potential internal problem.  Option D (medication) is a *treatment* but not necessarily the most impactful consequence of the underlying issue.



"
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke kgato ege ya mathomo ya maleba ge go hlahlobja motšwasehlabelo?","The correct answer is **C: Lekola boemo bja motšwasehlabelo** (Check the condition of the heart).

The prompt states that before checking the heart rate, you should first ensure the patient's safety and assess their condition, including any signs of difficulty breathing.  Therefore, checking the heart's condition is the initial step.
"
Naa ke efe ya dipolelo tšeo di latelago yeo e sa laetšego gabotse tshepedišo ya go hlahloba motšwasehlabelo?,"The correct answer is **B: Lekola lefelo la tiragalo pele ga motšwasehlabelo (Inspect the area before starting the leak test)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes safety:** The initial statement stresses the importance of checking the area before starting any work to ensure your safety.
* **Inspecting the area is a fundamental safety precaution:** Before any leak test, you need to identify potential hazards like electrical wires, sharp objects, or unstable structures.
* **Other options are less relevant or potentially dangerous:**
    * **A: O se ke wa tshwenyega ka go hwetša dikgobalo tša gago ka noši (Don't worry about finding your mistakes by ear):**  Relying solely on your ears is unsafe and inaccurate. You need visual confirmation.
    * **C: Lekola boemo bja motšwasehlabelo (Inspect the condition of the leak detector):** While important for proper function, this is a secondary check after ensuring the environment is safe.
    * **D: Leka go ela hloko go dilwana tšeo di sa kwešišegego (Be careful of unusual sounds):** Unusual sounds *could* indicate a problem, but the primary safety step is to inspect the area.



Therefore, inspecting the area for potential hazards *before* starting a leak test aligns directly with the safety principles highlighted in the prompt.



"
Ke fe ya diphetogo tšeo di thlohleleditšwego ka phetogo ya French yeo e bilego le khuetšo e kgolo go badudi ba sehlopha sa bašomi?,"The correct answer is **C: Go amogelwa ga dikgopolo tša Repabiliki (The acceptance of Republican principles)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gape ka morago ga dikgoba tša Phetogo di buletše bakgopedi ka moka ba banna go dumelela ba go ba le dikganyogo tša godimo le katlego go atlega."" This translates to: ""Furthermore, after the events of the Revolution, the revolutionaries specifically allowed men to have higher rights and the opportunity to advance.""  This implies a shift towards Republican principles where rights are not based on birthright but on merit and citizen participation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Thekgo yeo e oketšegilego ya setšhaba (Universal civic rights):** While the Revolution did contribute to the idea of universal civic rights, the passage specifically focuses on the rights granted *to men*. The expansion of rights was initially limited to men.
*   **B: Phetogo ya go tsitsinkela mogopolo go tšwa go ya bokgoni (The shift in status from birthright to ability):** This is a contributing factor to Republicanism, but the core change highlighted in the passage is the acceptance of Republican *principles* themselves, leading to the granting of rights.
*   **D: Tshepedišo ye mpsha ya go ela (The radical idea of being watched):** While the Reign of Terror was a radical development, the question is specifically about the changes for women. The passage doesn't mention the Reign of Terror or its impact on women.



Therefore, the acceptance of Republican principles is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Ka morago ga phetogo ya French, katlego ya tša sešoleng le ya go thopša ga naga e be esa kgonegi gore e theilwe godimo ga eng?","The correct answer is **A: Phihlelelo (Enlightenment)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the rise of ideas like republicanism, nationalism, and the belief in popular sovereignty (that the nation belongs to the people). These ideas are all central tenets of the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment emphasized reason, individual rights, and popular sovereignty, directly challenging the traditional basis of authority (divine right of kings, etc.).

After the French Revolution, the legitimacy of governments could no longer be based on:

* **Phihlelelo (Enlightenment):** This is the correct answer. The Enlightenment provided the intellectual framework for questioning traditional authority and advocating for new forms of government based on reason and individual rights.
* **Phapoši (Tradition/Custom):** While tradition played a role, the Enlightenment superseded it as the primary source of legitimacy.
* **Phišegelo (Faith/Religion):**  The Enlightenment emphasized reason over faith, so religion was no longer considered a primary basis for legitimacy.
* **Caliber/ya go swana (Military strength):** While military strength was important, the Enlightenment ideas provided a more fundamental and enduring basis for legitimacy than military power alone.



Therefore, the Enlightenment is the most accurate answer because it provided the intellectual foundation upon which the legitimacy of governments after the French Revolution could no longer be based.



"
Ke tirelo efe ya setšhaba yeo go thwego e hlola go se kgotsofale kudu dinageng tšeo di hlabologilego?,"The first part of the question discusses the rise and perceived justification of the welfare system. It raises questions about why it's becoming increasingly common and why it's often accepted, suggesting potential underlying factors.  This part is setting up a discussion about the *causes* and *justifications* of welfare.

The second part asks which aspect of society is most often scrutinized in developed countries that are relatively comfortable.  This is asking about the societal issue that generates the most concern.

Considering the options:

*   **A: Boleng bja meetse (Water quality)** - Important, but generally not the *most* scrutinized or discussed issue in developed countries.
*   **B: Kago ya leporogo (Food security)** -  A concern, but often addressed effectively in developed nations.
*   **C: Dinamelwa tša bohle (Universal welfare)** -  The rise of universal welfare programs (like the one discussed in the first part) often leads to considerable debate, scrutiny, and concern about their effectiveness, cost, and potential impact on individual responsibility.  This is a major issue in many developed countries.
*   **D: Thuto (Education)** -  A core societal concern, but often seen as a pathway to opportunity rather than a source of constant scrutiny or debate about basic needs.

Therefore, the most logical answer is **C: Dinamelwa tša bohle (Universal welfare)**.  The question directly links the rise of welfare to scrutiny and debate, which is most closely related to option C.



**So the answer to Q is C.**"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se ka šomišwago ka ditshepedišo tša dinamelwa tša bohle?","The correct answer is **A: Ka moka di be di ratwa ke yo mongwe le yo mongwe yo a di šomišago** (Generally, they are liked by everyone who uses them).

Here's why:

* The initial question describes a scenario where people generally enjoy and rely on the sewage system. The fact that it's ""balabalago ka tshepedišo ya dinamelwa"" (excited about the sewage system) suggests a positive perception.
* Option A directly reflects this positive sentiment.
* Options B, C, and D don't accurately capture the overall tone of the initial question. While sewage systems *can* be related to water quality, and *can* have some cost benefits, the primary point is the general acceptance and use of the system by the community.

Therefore, option A is the most fitting summary of the sewage system's general perception as described in the text.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ka bago boima go e kala ka lebaka la go tsebje e sa le ka pela ka baotledi?","The correct answer is **A: Lebelo la sephethephethe (Traffic Prediction)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that it's difficult to predict traffic flow with accuracy because driver behavior isn't always predictable.  Traffic prediction relies on anticipating future traffic conditions, which is inherently difficult due to the unpredictable nature of drivers.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Peakanyo ya tsela (Road Capacity):** Road capacity is a measure of how much traffic a road can handle. While important, it's not directly hampered by unpredictable driver behavior in the same way that *predicting* the flow is.
* **C: Ditiro tša tsela (Traffic Control):** Traffic control systems (like traffic lights) are designed to manage traffic, but they are not fundamentally *difficult* to implement because of unpredictable drivers.
* **D: Go tlala ga sephethephete (Traffic Congestion):** Traffic congestion is a *result* of unpredictable driver behavior and poor prediction, but it's not the *process* that makes prediction difficult. The difficulty lies in *forecasting* congestion.



Therefore, traffic prediction is the element most directly and significantly affected by unpredictable driver behavior.



"
Ke fe ya tše di latelago yeo e šomišwago ge e emelwa moela wa sephethephethe ka dipalo?,"The correct answer is **C: Moakanyetšo wa tsela (Traffic modeling)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that understanding traffic flow is difficult because human behavior is unpredictable. 
* However, traffic laws are based on calculations and can be predicted using numbers.
* This directly relates to **traffic modeling**, which is the process of using mathematical and computational methods to simulate and analyze traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ditiro tša tsela (Road operations)**: While traffic flow *affects* road operations, it's not the direct answer to how traffic flow is modeled numerically.
* **B: Maitshwaro a mootledi (Human behavior)**: The passage explicitly says human behavior is *unpredictable*, making it difficult to model numerically.
* **D: Go tlala ga sephethephete (Traffic congestion)**: Congestion is a *result* of traffic flow problems. Modeling focuses on the underlying flow, not just the congestion.



"
Naa Hershey le Chase ba dirišitše eng go tsenya DNA ya bona? ,"The correct answer is **A: Radioactive phosphorus**.

Here's why:

* **Hershey and Chase used radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of the bacteriophage.**  They knew that phosphorus is a key component of DNA.  By incorporating radioactive phosphorus into the phage DNA, they could track where the DNA went during infection.

* **Radioactive sulfur was used to label the protein of the phage.**

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Karolwana ya leabela** - This is too general. They weren't simply using ""labeled"" material; they were using *radioactive* labeled material.
* **C: Radioactive sulfur** - This is correct for labeling the protein, but the question asks what they used to *sense* the DNA entering the bacterium.
* **D: Dikokwane-hloko** -  They used *bacteriophages* (viruses that infect bacteria), not just bacteria.



"
Bokgoni bja gore phetogo ya diphedi e fetišetšwe go bana bo ithekgile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Bohlokwa bja dilo tša leabela (Genetic factors)**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Diphetogo go disele tša di germ fela tšeo di ka fetetšwago go bana..."" This means we're talking about genetic mutations in the germline cells (sperm and egg).
* **Genetic factors are key to inheritance:** Genetic mutations are passed down from parents to offspring through their germ cells. The likelihood of a genetic mutation being inherited depends on the specific genetic factors involved.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ge e ba disele e le tša mothaladi wa twatši (If the cell is a female reproductive cell):** While relevant for certain types of genetic mutations, it doesn't encompass the general factor influencing heritability. Both male and female germ cells can carry mutations passed on to offspring.
* **C: Mohuta wa phetogo ya diphedi (Type of genetic mutation):** While the *type* of mutation is important (e.g., point mutation vs. chromosomal translocation), the *underlying factors* influencing heritability are genetic.
* **D: Ge e ba phetogo ya diphedi e ka hlola lehu la sele (If the genetic mutation can affect the sele's blood):** While mutations *can* affect blood, the ability to pass them on to offspring is determined by genetic inheritance, not simply the effect on blood itself.



Therefore, **Genetic factors (B)** are the most fundamental determinant of whether a germline genetic mutation will be passed down to children."
"Go ya ka tshedimošo ye e theilwego godimo ga temana ye e filwego, ke eng seo ditlamorago tšeo di fapafapanego tša diphetogo tša leabela di sa ithekgego ka tšona?","The correct answer is **A: Ke tekanyo e kaakang ya dilo tša leabela yeo e amegilego.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diphetogo go disele tša di germ fela tšeo di ka fetetšwago go bana, ge diphetogo go gongwe di ka hlola polao ya disele goba kankere.""  This implies that the *amount* of abnormal cell growth is a key factor in determining if a change is cancerous or precancerous. The passage doesn't mention gender, the importance of the abnormal cells themselves, or the specific type of cell change as the primary differentiator. It's the *quantity* that matters.



Therefore, option A best reflects the passage's emphasis."
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e bego e se lebaka la gore ditirišo tša bogologolo tša setšo di beye dipudi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba tšweleditše go hwetšagala ga nama (They sought to obtain meat)**.

The passage states that early settlements were established for easy access to ""maswi, meriri, nama, le matlalo"" (game, fish, meat, and honey).  This directly links the establishment of settlements to the pursuit of meat. While the other options might have been secondary benefits, the primary driver mentioned is the acquisition of meat.
"
Nepokgolo ya golf ke go tšea tefo ye nenyane ya eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Stokes**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes golf as a game of hitting a ball into holes.** The goal is to do this in the fewest number of strokes.
* **""Stroke"" is the term used in golf to count each swing of the club.** The player aims to minimize their total number of strokes.

Therefore, the question asks what the game is about earning, and that's strokes.
"
"Lefelong la golf, ka kae moo mabjang a segilwego ka boripana?","The correct answer is **A: Ka lešobeng la bo lesomeseswai**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Golf ke taloko yeo dibapadi di šomišago sa go betha go bethela dinkgokolwana ka gare ga melete. Melete ye lesomeseswai e ralokilwe ka nako ya mehla, dibapadi di thoma go molete wa pele seemong gomme di fetša go wa bo lesomeseswai.""

This translates to: ""Golf is a sport where players try to hit balls into holes. The hole is located in the green, and players start on the tee and move to the green.""

Therefore, the green (where the hole is located) is where the putting happens, and the text mentions the green is the area where the ball is rolled *after* the tee shot and fairway shots.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mo go tala (On the tee):** Players start on the tee, but the ball isn't typically rolled *on* the tee. It's hit *from* the tee.
* **C: Lešobeng la pele (On the fairway):** The fairway is the area between the tee and the green.
* **D: Seripeng sa pele sa thaloko (The first slope of the hole):** This refers to the slope of the hole itself, not where putting happens.



"
Naa ke morero o mofe o tlwaelegilego wa teko?,"The correct answer is **B: Go lemoga gore lefase le šoma bjang (To understand how the world works)**.

Here's why:

* **The question** asks about a plan that helps us understand how the world functions based on evidence.
* **The text** describes a plan (referred to as ""Morero"" - plan) that uses observation, experimentation, and data analysis to gain knowledge. This process ultimately aims to understand how things work.
* **Option B** directly reflects this aim of understanding the workings of the world.

Let's look at why the other options are not as suitable:

* **A: Go fediša ye tee goba tše dintši tša dikgopolokgolo tšeo di kgonegago (To test one or many possible hypotheses):** While testing hypotheses is *part* of the process, it's not the overall goal described in the text.  The text emphasizes understanding the world through a broader process.
* **C: Go botšiša dipotšišo (To ask questions):** Asking questions is a *component* of the process, but not the ultimate objective.
* **D: Go hlahla nyakišišo tša boithutamahlale (To analyze scientific evidence):** Analyzing evidence is *part* of the process, but not the overarching aim as presented in the text.

Therefore, **B** best encapsulates the overall objective of the plan described.
"
"Go ya ka temana , ke eng seo se sa thušego go hlahla ga nyakišišo ya mahlale?","The correct answer is **A: Mokgwa wa mahlale o nnoši (Expert intuition)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while expert intuition *can* be a factor, it's not the *primary* or ideal method for validating expertise. The passage emphasizes a more rigorous approach involving:

* **Methodology, practice, and criteria:** This suggests a structured process.
* **Testing assumptions:**  Actively questioning what's believed.
* **Formulating hypotheses:** Creating testable predictions.

Expert intuition alone doesn't address these elements. The other options are all valid components of validating expertise:

* **B: Go dira dilo tšeo di hlokometšwego (Doing things that have been observed):**  Observational evidence is crucial.
* **C: Go fediša dikgopolokgolo tšeo di ka kgonegago (Testing possible hypotheses):**  Testing hypotheses is a core part of the scientific method and validating expertise.
* **D: Go dira diteko (Conducting tests):** Testing is essential for objective validation.



Therefore, the passage implies that relying solely on expert intuition is insufficient and not the best way to validate expertise.

"Go ya ka temana, ke polelo efe mabapi le madimo a magolo yeo e sego ya nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Madimo a magolo a kgona go senya selo se sengwe le sengwe seo se lego tikologong ya ona.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Dithonado di ka senya tšhohle tseleng ya tšona."" (Tornadoes can destroy everything in its path.) This is a strong statement about the destructive power of tornadoes.
* **Option A reflects this:** It says large tornadoes *can* destroy anything in their environment. This aligns perfectly with the information in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Madimo a hlasela mafelo a manyenyane go feta madimo a mangwe:** The text doesn't specify that tornadoes target small animals more than other things. It focuses on the overall destructive capability.
* **C: Bontši bja madimo a magolo a tšea diiri tše fetago tše tharo:** The text says most *very strong* tornadoes exceed the speed of three times the speed of sound. It *doesn't* say *most large* tornadoes do.
* **D: Madimo a mangwe a magolo a ka ba le diphefo/moya wa go fihla go 300 miles ka iri:** The text mentions some very strong tornadoes reach speeds exceeding 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph), but it doesn't say *many large tornadoes* reach this speed.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dipolelo tšeo di latelago di hlalošago gabotse ka bontši bja madimo a magolo?","The correct answer is **A: Gantši di tšea diiri tše fetago tše tharo**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dithonado tše pedi tša dithonado tše šoro kudu di tšea tekano ya go feta diiri tše tharo.""  This translates to: ""The two of the most violent tornadoes reach speeds exceeding 300 miles per hour.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di hlola diphefo/moya go dikologa go 480 miles ka iri** - While tornadoes are powerful, the text doesn't directly state they ""explore"" the atmosphere at 480 miles per hour. The speed mentioned is the maximum speed they *reach*.
* **C: Di ama mafelo a magolo go feta madimo a mangwe** - The text mentions tornadoes can pick up debris, but doesn't say they pick up *more* debris than other storms.
* **D: Di kgona go gagola mehlare go tloga fase** - The text explicitly states tornadoes *pick up* debris, but doesn't say they can pick it up ""from the ground.""  It's more about the process of picking it up during the tornado's path.



"
Ke dife tša tše di latelago tšeo batho ba thomilego go di dira ka lekgolo la bo 16 la mengwaga?,"The correct answer is **D: Go dire di telescope** (To make telescopes).

Here's why:

* The passage states that telescopes were first built in Europe in the late 16th century and used to magnify the view of stars.
* The question asks what people started doing on a large scale in the 16th century. The building of telescopes directly addresses this.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Go diriša dilense** (To use lenses): While lenses are *part* of telescopes, the question asks about the large-scale activity.  Using lenses is a function of using a telescope, not the act of making them.
* **B: Go godiša dilwana** (To mint coins): The passage has nothing to do with minting coins.
* **C: Go dira dilense** (To make lenses): Making lenses is a *component* of making telescopes, but it's not the whole activity.  The passage emphasizes the telescopes themselves.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **D**."
Ke nako ye kaaka’ng batho ba godiša dilo ba diriša dilense?,"The correct answer is **D: Ga e sa le go tloga mathomong a lekgolo la bo16 la mengwaga**

Here's why:

The passage states that telescopes were first made in Europe at the *end* of the 16th century.  The question asks when people started using lenses to magnify things.  Therefore, the answer must be when telescopes were invented, which was at the end of the 16th century. Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ka mengwaga ye sekete (For centuries):** The passage specifies the invention was at the end of the 16th century, not for centuries afterward.
* **B: Ga e sa le go tloga mafelelong a lekgolo la bo 16 la mengwaga (Since the end of the 16th century):** While close, ""ga e sa le go tloga"" means ""since,"" and the question is asking when the *use* of lenses for magnification started, which occurred with the invention of the telescope. Option D is more precise.
* **C: Ka mengwaga ye dikete (For centuries):**  Similar to option A, this is too broad and doesn't reflect the specific time frame indicated in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana ye, legaga la Muhammad le reng ka mekgwa ya gagwe ya semoya goba ditekanyetšo?","The correct answer is **A: O tšeela godimo khutšo le go ikarola**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O ikgobotše, yeo e phologilego gantši, e fa seswantšho sa go bonala botse sa bodumedi bja tša semoya bja Muhammad."" This translates to: ""He was often secluded, which shows the true manifestation of the spiritual depth of Muhammad.""  ""Ikgobotše"" means he secluded himself. The phrase ""tšeela godimo khutšo le go ikarola"" (secluded himself and meditated) best captures this meaning of spiritual seclusion and contemplation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lešata la ka ntle le ka thuša go nagana** (External noise can help with thinking): The passage emphasizes the opposite – the importance of being free from external distractions.
* **C: O be nyaka nako ye nyenyane kudu ya go ba noši** (He only wanted very little time to be secluded): The passage indicates he *often* secluded himself, not just for very short periods.
* **D: O be a tshwenyegile ka go bonwa le theeletšwa** (He was afraid of being seen and watched): The passage suggests he was *secluded* – implying a deliberate choice for privacy, not fear of being observed.



"
"Go ya ka temana, tšhipi e be e dirišetšwa eng pele?","The correct answer is **C: Maotwana**.

The passage states: ""Mafelelong, maotwana a kota a tlošitšwe legatong la maotwana a tšhipi."" which translates to ""Finally, the planks were removed to the plank store.""  This implies that the planks (maotwana) were the material used for the ""tšhipi"" (which is later identified as a type of covering or planking). The passage also mentions that the planks were placed on top of the wagon wheels. Therefore, the planks (maotwana) were the initial material being used.
"
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke ka lebaka la eng maotwana a kota a ile a tšeelwa legato ke maotwana a tšhipi?","The correct answer is **D: Di be di aparwa ke tšhipi yeo e bego e le diporong.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mafelelong, maotwana a kota a tlošitšwe legatong la maotwana a tšhipi. Ka 1767, diporo tša tšhipi di ile tša tsebišwa."" 

This directly translates to: ""Finally, the canvas was removed to the canvas room. In 1767, canvas sails were invented.""

Therefore, the canvas was *part of the sails* and was removed to the canvas room, implying the sails *were made of canvas*.  Option D correctly identifies that the canvas was the material of the sails (the ""diporo tša tšhipi"").

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Ba ile ba oketša lebelo la dipere** (They were looking for a better sail design) - The passage doesn't say they were looking for a better design; it focuses on the canvas material.
*   **B: Di be di lebelelwa e le tšeo di šomago gabotse kudu** (They were considered to work very well) - While sails were important, the passage doesn't focus on their overall performance, but on the canvas material.
*   **C: Di be di kgona go swara merwalo ye megolo** (They were able to fight big battles) - The passage mentions fighting battles in the context of the sails, but not as the primary reason for removing the canvas.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se bopilego batho ka o tee ka o tee nakong ya Romanticism?","The correct answer is **C: Mekgwa (Customs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go ya ka Romanticism, batho bao ba bopilwego ke thutafase, go ya le nako mekgwa le setšo tša go amana le thatafase yeo di tšweletši, gomme tše, ka bo tee le lefelo la setšhaba, di be di le kaone go feta melao ya kgapeletšo.""

This translates to: ""According to Romanticism, people who are built on enthusiasm, along with the time, customs and art that are evolving, and these, along with the national character, were more important than the laws of etiquette.""

The passage explicitly links **customs (mekgwa)** to being more important than laws of etiquette during the Romantic period.  Therefore, customs are the closest fit to the question.



"
Naa ke efe ya dipolelo tše di latelago yeo e sa bontšhego kgopolo ya kakaretšo ya boikemišetšo bja theknolotši? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ditlamorago tša theknolotši setšhabeng di beilwe maemong a tša leago.**

Here's why:

The passage states that technological commitment often has two components: 1) technological advancement driven by the direction of the technological field or politics, and 2) technological ""consequences"" for the populations who are able to benefit. Option A directly reflects the second component - the consequences/impacts - being treated as secondary or lagging behind.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tlhabollo ya theknolotši ga e huetše ke setšo:** The passage says technological advancement *is* driven by the technological field.
* **C: Theknolotši e na le ditlamorago tša tlhago setšhabeng:** While the passage mentions consequences, it doesn't specifically tie them to ""health consequences"" as the answer suggests. It's a broader statement about consequences for populations.
* **D: Tlhabollo ya theknolotši ga ya beiwa godimo ga khuetšo ya sepolotiki:** The passage states that technological advancement *is* driven by the direction of the technological field *or* politics. This option implies politics being secondary, which isn't what the passage says.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa amanego le go goga ga bow?","The correct answer is **D: Go thoma ka segwagwa** (To start with a whistle).

Here's why:

The passage describes a dance involving movements of the hands and feet. It specifically mentions:

*   ""Godimo go ra gore o swanetše o thome ntlheng gomme o kgorometše bora"" (Upwards, you should start with your hands and wave them to the north)
*   ""fase gora gore o swanetše o thome go frog (moo letsogo la gago le tswerego bora) gomme o goge bora"" (Downwards, you should start with a frog (with your face pointing north) and jump to the north).

The passage is focused on the hand and foot movements of the dance.  ""Go thoma ka segwagwa"" (To start with a whistle) describes a sound, not a movement in the dance described.  The other options relate to dance movements described in the passage.

"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e amanago le modumo o boleta?","The correct answer is **A: Leswao la bow ya fase**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Godimo go ra gore o swanetše o thome ntlheng gomme o kgorometše bora, gomme fase gora gore o swanetše o thome go frog (moo letsogo la gago le tswerego bora) **ga fase** gora gore o swanetše o thome go frog (moo letsogo la gago le tswerego bora) **go gatela godimo gantši go tšweletša modumo wa bonolwana**..."" This directly links ""leswao la bo ka fase bja bow"" (the sound of the bowstring hitting the wood) to the development of a good tone. The other options describe actions related to playing the bow but don't connect to the development of a good tone as directly.
"
Di fossil di bontšha gore diatla mafelelong di ile tša tlwaela gore di dirišwe kudukudu bakeng sa go lateng tše dife?,"The correct answer is **D: Go sepela ka knuckle**.

The passage states: ""Letsogo le leoto la chimpanzee le a swana ka tekano le botelele, go laetša tšhomišo ya letsogo sa go rwala boima ge e sepela e kwatame."" This means the chimpanzee's hand is similar to a human's in terms of size and length, and the thumb is opposable for grasping.  It then goes on to say that fossil evidence from millions of years ago shows the hand evolved from gripping to knuckle-walking.
"
Ke efe ya tšeo di latelago yeo e hlalošago gabotse ka di-phalanges tša chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **C: Di šomišwa go rwala boima**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Letsogo le leoto la chimpanzee le a swana ka tekano le botelele, go laetša tšhomišo ya letsogo sa go rwala boima ge e sepela e kwatame."" (The size and shape of a chimpanzee's hand are similar in size and length, reflecting the ability of the hand to grasp when it's needed.)

This directly indicates that the phalanges (finger bones) of a chimpanzee's hand are adapted for grasping.  Option C accurately reflects this adaptation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di otlologile go feta batho’ (They are longer than humans):** The passage says the size is similar, not that chimpanzee phalanges are longer.
*   **B: Matsogo le maoto di fapana ka bogolo (Hands and feet are greatly different):** The passage implies similarity in size and shape, not great difference.
*   **D: Di šomišwa kudukudu bakeng sa go dirišwa gampe (They are adapted for climbing):** While chimpanzees climb, the passage focuses on the grasping ability, not climbing."
Kgetho e tloša phapano ye mpsha ya leabela go tšwa letamong le lefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Fihlilwe (Extinct)**.

The passage states: ""Nyakišišo ya ngwagakgolo wa masomepedi e bontšhitše gore go na le phapano ya dikarolwana tše pedi tša leabela: ya go khuta le ya go itšweletša. Diphetogo di tlaleletša phapano ye ntshwa ya tswalo, gomme tlhaolo ye e tloša go molete wa phapano yeo e laeditšwego.""

This translates to: ""Decades of research have shown there are two types of symbiosis: mutualism and parasitism. Changes have led to a distinct difference in reproduction, and the extinction of the rarer symbiosis is favored by the more common one.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that the extinction of the rarer symbiosis is favored, indicating that the distinct difference in symbiosis arose from the extinction of one type.



"
Ke tshepedišo efe yeo e tšeago maikarabelo ka go oketša phapano ya dikarolwana tša leabela?,"The correct answer is **C: Phetogo ya diphedi (Contrast)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the study shows a distinction between two types of gene regulation: activation and repression.
* It also mentions that changes in these regulatory mechanisms lead to a sharp distinction in gene expression, and the gene responsible for this difference is turned on/off.
* The passage further notes that contrast and sequential analysis highlight the difference before and after the expression of the two genes within the same species.

Therefore, **contrast** is the key concept used to describe the difference between the two types of gene regulation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go aroganya (Correlation):** Correlation implies a relationship between variables, not necessarily a distinction or difference.
* **B: Go kopantšha gape (Integration):** Integration suggests combining things, which is the opposite of highlighting a difference.
* **D: E hlalošitšwe (Harmonized):** Harmonized implies making things consistent, not highlighting differences.

"Go ya ka tshedimošo yeo e le go ka temaneng, ke dilo dife tšeo motho wa mathomo a swanetšego go di ja go rarolla “ bothata bja diprotheine’’?","The correct answer is **D: Dikutu tša matšoba**.

Here's why:

The text states that wild animals (like chimpanzees) solve the ""protein problem"" by eating insects.  The text then contrasts this with humans, who need to obtain protein from other sources.  It mentions that animal products (insects, rodents, eggs) are good sources of high-quality proteins with essential amino acids.  Therefore, considering the options, **Dikutu tša matšoba (Insects)** are the most logical choice as a food source that humans could eat to solve the ""protein problem,"" mirroring the behavior of chimpanzees.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mathata afe ao latelago ao a hlotšego ke go hlokego ya amino acids ye bohlokwa?","The correct answer is **C: Kgolo yeo e gatelegilego (Rapid growth)**.

The text states: ""Godimo ga moo, go palelwa ke go dira bjalo go na le ditlamorago tše bohlokwa; **kgatelelo ya monagano yeo e golago**..."" (Above all, it is believed that doing so has important consequences; **rapid growth of the colony**...). The text then goes on to explain that the lack of essential amino acids can hinder this rapid growth.

The other options are mentioned in the text, but not directly linked as a consequence of the lack of essential amino acids:

* **A: Ditaba tša tšhilo ya dijo (Food sources)** is a general topic discussed, but not a specific consequence.
* **B: Phepompe (Feces)** is a byproduct of protein metabolism, but not a primary issue *caused* by a lack of amino acids.
* **D: Lehu (Blood)** is mentioned as containing proteins, but not a consequence of amino acid deficiency.



"
Maloko a setšo se senyenyane se se itšego gantši se bontšha bjang tswalano ya tšona le sehlopha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka go amogela ditumelo tša motho yo mongwe le yo mongwe yo a ba dikologilego.**

Here's why:

The passage discusses ethnic identity and how it's shaped by various factors. A ""small, self-assured ethnic group"" demonstrates its relationship with other groups by accepting the opinions of individuals who are considered respected or authoritative. This shows a degree of integration and respect, rather than simply conforming to public opinion (C) or using stereotypes (D). While internal agreement (A) can be a factor, accepting the opinions of respected individuals is a more active demonstration of how the group relates to others.

"Go ya ka kgopolokgolo yeo e tšweleditšwego temaneng, ke eng seo se ka diregago ka ngwana yo a e bapetšago le sehlopha se senyenyane sa morafo seo se bonwago ka tsela yeo fošagetšego ka lebaka la go tsenela boitshwaro bjo bo tšhošetšago","The correct answer is **C: Ngwana o tla gogela morago ka boitshwaro bja leago** (The child will fall behind in learning due to the contagious behavior).

Here's why:

* **The question describes a scenario where a child's behavior (e.g., cheating, being disruptive) negatively impacts the learning of their peers.** This creates a disruptive and potentially negative learning environment.
* **""Gogela morago"" (fall behind)** directly addresses the consequence of this disruptive behavior.  When a child engages in undesirable behaviors, it can divert attention from learning, disrupt classroom activities, and negatively affect the overall learning process for everyone, including the child themselves.
* **Let's look at why the other options are less likely:**
    * **A: Ngwana o tla leka go efoga go tsenela boitshwaro bjo bo tšhošetšago** (The child will try to avoid engaging in the contagious behavior): While possible, this doesn't address the *impact* of the contagious behavior on learning.
    * **B: Ngwana o tla ba le kgonagalo e kgolo ya go tsenela boitshwaro bjo bo tšhošetšago** (The child will have a strong desire to engage in the contagious behavior):  This is a less likely outcome. While peer pressure can influence behavior, it doesn't automatically guarantee a strong desire to engage in negative behavior.
    * **D: Ngwana o tla gana go boledišana le dihlopha tše dingwe tše dinnyane tša morafi** (The child will refuse to interact with other smaller peer groups): This is a possible *reaction*, but it doesn't directly explain the educational consequence described in the scenario.



Therefore, the most logical and direct consequence of a child's disruptive behavior impacting their peers' learning is falling behind academically.



"
"Go ya ka temana, tsebo ya ngwana ya dipono tše di fošagetšego tša morafi di ka ba le khuetšo go tše dife tša tše di latelago?","The correct answer is **C: Dikamano tša bona le bana ba bangwe (Their relationships with other children)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what can help prevent the negative consequences of sibling rivalry. The passage highlights that sibling rivalry can lead to academic problems. Option C directly addresses this by suggesting that a child's relationships with other children play a crucial role. 

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Bonnyane bja morafi bjo ba kgethago go itshwantšha le bona (Their own sibling's personality):** While personality plays a role, it doesn't directly address how to *prevent* negative outcomes stemming from sibling rivalry.
*   **B: Maitshwaro a bona (Their behaviors):**  Behaviors are a *result* of the dynamic, not a preventative measure. While managing behavior is important, it doesn't directly address the root cause.
*   **D: Tlhalošo ya bona ya morafe (Their perception of the family):** This is related to emotional well-being, but less directly related to academic difficulties caused by rivalry than the relationships with other children.

**Explanation of why relationships with other children matter:**

If a child has positive and healthy relationships with other children (both siblings and peers), they are likely to:

*   Develop better social skills.
*   Learn conflict resolution strategies.
*   Have a stronger sense of belonging and self-worth.

All of these factors can help them cope with the stress and negative emotions associated with sibling rivalry and ultimately improve their academic performance.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo go ka se bego le kgonagalo ya gore e sepelelane le kgodišo ya ngwana wa naga?","The correct answer is **C: Go ikarola ga setlwaedi (Self-reliance)**.

Here's why:

The text describes feral children as having to develop behaviors (often mimicking animal behaviors) to survive *without* human intervention. This implies they have to be self-reliant. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go phela ka go ikemela (Living by oneself):** While feral children might eventually live alone, the text emphasizes their initial survival *with* animals, not necessarily completely isolated.
* **B: Bokgoni bjo bo tiilego bja poledišano (A strong ability for communication):**  The text highlights a *lack* of human communication and the development of animal-like behaviors, not a strong ability for human communication.
* **D: Go tshwenyega ga tša leago (Dependence on older children):**  The text states that feral children often *lose* their older siblings and have to survive on their own.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e hlalošago ka nepo ya boitshwaro bja tšweletšo ya bana?","The correct answer is **B: Boitshwaro bja naga botšwa go hlokego ya kgwerano le batho.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bana ba diphaga ba ka ba ba itemogetše tlaišo ya bana ye šoro goba kgatheletšego pele ga go lahlwa goba go tšaba. ... Gona, ba tšweletša maitswaro (ka gare ga dipeeletšo tša go sepela) a go tloga a nyaka go tswana ka go felelela le a phoofolo yeo ya go mohlokomela, **jalo ka dipoifo tša yona go fapana le batho.**""

This directly supports option B, which says that the behavior of feral children stems from their difference from humans.  They develop behaviors *different from humans* and *similar to animals* they interact with.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bontši bja leago bja boitshwaro go naga bo hlolwa ke senyegelwa ke mmele:** The passage mentions physical development but doesn't attribute the core behavior *origin* to physical development alone.  It's about the learned behavior stemming from lack of human interaction.
* **C: Boitshwaro bja sehlogo bo atile fela mo baneng bao ba tswaletšwego go batswadi ba bona:** The passage states that feral children can be abandoned *before* being born, so this option is too restrictive.
* **D: Boitshwaro ka moka bja naga bo hlolwa ke bogole bjo bogolo bja tlhaloganyo:** While intelligence is involved, the passage emphasizes learning *from* animals and the differences from human behavior, not just general intelligence.

"Go ya ka temana, ke mekgwa efe ye e latelago yeo e sa sepelelanego le temo ye e lebanego le go iphediša?","The correct answer is **B: Go tšweletša dijo tša go rekišetša ba bangwe (To produce food for sale)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that a *true* food security strategy focuses on ensuring sufficient food for the family and community. Option B, focusing on producing food for *sale*, shifts the focus away from immediate family needs and towards profit, which can undermine food security. It can lead to prioritizing cash income over ensuring everyone has enough to eat.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go tsepama mo go tšweletšo ya poelo yeo e fihlelelago dinyakwa tša lapa la molemirui (Focusing on agricultural production that meets the family's needs):** This aligns with the core message of the passage - food security for the family.
* **C: Go tsepamiša poelo ya godimo ya go fapana le dithekniki tša maemo a godimo (Prioritizing higher-level agriculture over higher-level techniques):** This option is too vague and doesn't directly address the issue of food security.  The passage mentions simple techniques like preserving vegetables, which are practical.
* **D: Go tšweletša dinyakwa tša selegae go ya lefelong la molemirui (Developing free enterprises at the level of the community):**  While community enterprises can be beneficial, the passage's focus is on basic food security for families, not on broader economic development.



Therefore, option B is the only one that deviates from the passage's emphasis on direct food security for families and communities.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""temo ya nnete"" (true tradition) as a simple way to ensure food security and well-being within a community. It highlights the preservation of seeds and simple methods of cultivation.  Option C directly reflects this:  the core of this tradition is about sharing resources (seeds and crops) within the community, fostering collective well-being.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ke tshepedišo ya manyora ka botlalo (It's a tradition of written records):** The passage emphasizes oral tradition (""temo yeo e dirwago bakeng sa tšweletšo ya dijo tše dilekanego go kopana le dihloko tša molemi le lapa la gagore"" - a tradition practiced for food security and the well-being of the community and family).  Written records aren't mentioned.
* **B: E šomiša dithekniki tša moswananoši go godiša dibjalo (It uses traditional techniques to cultivate crops):** While the passage mentions cultivation techniques, it focuses on simple, traditional methods (seed preservation, simple farming) rather than specifically ""traditional techniques"" in a broader sense.
* **D: E sa šomišwa ke balemi-rui ditšhabeng tše dingwe (It's not practiced by other tribes in other areas):** The passage states that the core concept of the tradition exists in many countries that are not developing, implying it *is* practiced elsewhere.



Therefore, **C** is the best fit for describing the essence of this ""true tradition.""



"
Go etela musiamo go ka wela ka tlase ga legoro lefe la boeti?,"The correct answer is **C: Boeti bja setšo (Cultural Tourists)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that **Boeti bja Setšo (Cultural Tourists)** are those who travel to learn about the history and image of a specific culture.
* The question asks where visiting a mountain falls under the category of tourists. Mountains are often significant cultural landmarks and historical sites.
* The other options are less relevant:
    * **Boeti bja Boithabišo (Adventure Tourists)** focus on thrill-seeking activities, which might include hiking a mountain, but isn't the primary defining characteristic.
    * **Boeti bja Kgwebo (Business Tourists)** travel for business purposes.
    * **Boeti bja Ka Ntle (Leisure Tourists)** is too broad and doesn't specifically address the cultural aspect mentioned in the text.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo e ka bago selo seo se ka tlago pele ga basepedi ba boithabišo?","The correct answer is **A: Go inela mo setšong sa lefelo leo** (To immerse themselves in the culture of the place).

Here's why:

* The passage states that tourists visiting cultural sites are primarily interested in understanding the history and identity of the place. 
* ""Go inela mo setšong sa lefelo leo"" directly reflects this interest in cultural immersion. It implies learning about customs, traditions, and ways of life.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Go khutša mo mekgweng ya bona ya letšatši ka letšatši** (To blend into their daily routines): While tourists might observe daily life, the primary focus of visiting cultural sites is not to become part of the routine.
* **C: Go bona maswao a bohlokwa a naga** (To see the important landmarks of the country): Seeing landmarks is a part of tourism, but it's not the core reason for visiting a cultural site. 
* **D: Go kwešiša histori ya lefelo** (To understand the history of the place): Understanding history is important, but it's a component of cultural immersion, not the encompassing goal.

Therefore, immersing oneself in the culture is the most accurate answer based on the passage.

The passage explicitly states: ""Go gopola makgetlo a go feta a maitshwaro a tša kgwebo le dipoelo tša dikatlego go thušitse batho gore ba bulege bakeng sa diphetogo tše diswa le ditsela tše diswa bakeng sa kereke ya gae."" (Remembering successful business stories more than achievements of morality and successes of talents helped people to strive for radical changes and radical ways for the church at home.)

This directly addresses the question of what helped reduce the fear of change within the church.

"Go ya ka temana,go hwetša kwešišo ya histori ya motho ka noši go ka thuša ka eng?","The correct answer is **C: Go hwetša maikutlo a lefelo la ka gare ga mokgahlo (To gain insights into the inner world of a family).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Gantši e thuša batho go ba le hlaloganyo ya gore ba wela kae mo historing ya mokgatlo."" (Often it helps people have an understanding of where they fall in the history of the family.) This directly relates to gaining insights into the inner workings and emotional landscape of a family.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go fokotša poifo ya phetogo (To reduce the fear of change):** While understanding history *can* help with change, the passage focuses on the insights gained from understanding the family's history itself, not just reducing fear of change. The passage also mentions that focusing on positive family stories reduces fear of change.
* **B: Go maatlafatša ditekanyetšo (To strengthen expectations):** The passage doesn't directly link understanding family history to strengthening expectations.
* **D: Go kaonafatša boitshwaro bja kgwebo (To improve business practices):** The passage mentions that understanding family history can help with family changes, not business practices.

Ke efe ya dipolelo tšeo di latelago yeo e hlalošago ka nepo mokgwa wa go ithuta wa ka morago ga sebjalebjale?,"The best answer is **A: Diphihlelo tše dingwe tša go ithuta di hola kudu go feta tše dingwe** (Other learning habits grow more than others).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that learning isn't just about passively receiving information.** It highlights the role of personal experiences, reflection, and applying knowledge.
* **Option A connects to this by suggesting that different aspects of learning develop at different rates.** This aligns with the idea that learning is an ongoing process of growth and refinement, not a single, complete event.
* **Let's look at why the other options aren't as strong:**
    * **B: Go ithuta go swanetše go tsenelela mo dilong tšeo re dumelago gore re tla itemogela tšona** (Learning requires entering into things that we believe we will experience) - While experience is important, the passage focuses more on *actively applying* and *reflecting* on experiences, not just believing we'll experience them.
    * **C: Ditsela tše itšego tša go ithuta di kaone go feta tše dingwe** (Self-directed learning methods can be better than others) - The passage acknowledges self-directed learning, but doesn't definitively say it's *always* better.  It frames it as one important aspect among others.
    * **D: Ga go na dilo tšeo di feletšego mo go ithuteng** (There are no things that are completed in learning) - This is true, but option A offers a more nuanced and actionable insight into *how* learning progresses.

Therefore, option A best encapsulates the passage's message about the evolving and dynamic nature of learning habits.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that learning happens through the interaction between the student and existing knowledge.** It highlights that models (role models) and knowledge are crucial for effective learning.
* **Option C directly reflects this point.** It states that learning models are specific to the student and the existing knowledge they possess. This aligns perfectly with the passage's central idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go na le ditsela tše dintši tša go ithuta tsebo (There are many ways to learn knowledge):** While true, this is a general statement and doesn't capture the passage's specific focus on the student-knowledge interaction.
* **B: Maitemogelo a itšego a go ithuta a swanetše go etišwa pele go feta a mangwe (Self-learning models should be prioritized over others):** The passage doesn't advocate for prioritizing self-learning models. It suggests that models are important *in general*.
* **D: Tsebo yeo re ka se tsogego re e dirišitše sa le bohlokwa go ithuta (Knowledge we already have is not important for learning):** This is the opposite of what the passage says. It emphasizes that existing knowledge is the foundation for new learning.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about actions that *delay* urination after already having urinated normally.** This means we're looking for something that would prevent the bladder from emptying.
* **Option C** describes clamping the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the bladder) and then returning after a few decades. This directly prevents urination.
* **Option A** - Reading or scrolling on your phone - doesn't directly impact the bladder's emptying process.
* **Option B** - Using a heating pad and returning to the bathroom - could *encourage* urination, not delay it.
* **Option D** - Drinking water before leaving - would likely *increase* the urge to urinate.



Therefore, option C is the only choice that describes an action designed to *delay* urination after a normal void."
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sego tlhalošo ye e nepagetšego ya go šitiša boroko?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka morago ga go tsoga, tabakgolo ke go robala gape ka diiri tše pedi (It's common to sleep again with two pillows after getting up)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines sleep inertia as the feeling of grogginess after waking up.** It explains it's due to the transition from sleep to wakefulness.
* **Option D describes a common experience *after* waking up, not the definition of sleep inertia itself.** While some people might sleep with two pillows after waking, that's a separate behavior and not a core component of sleep inertia.
* **Options A, B, and C are all accurate descriptions of sleep inertia as defined in the passage:**
    * **A: E ka beiwa godimo ga boirhythm (It can be above rhythm):**  Sleep inertia disrupts the normal rhythm of waking.
    * **B: Tabakgolo ke gore o se ke wa itsoša mo go feletšego (It's common that you won't wake up fully):** Sleep inertia causes a feeling of not being fully awake.
    * **C: Tshepedišo e direga nakong ya gago yeo e tlwaelegilego ya boroko (The phenomenon occurs during your usual sleep time):** Sleep inertia can happen even after a full night's sleep.



Therefore, option D is the only one that *doesn't* align with the provided definition of sleep inertia.



"
"Ge bjoko bo dutše bo leka go lora ka mo go kwagalago gantši, ke eng seo se oketšegilego?","The correct answer is **A: Palo ya REM laetša gore**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people who frequently use screens tend to have trouble sleeping. A key reason given is the suppression of REM sleep. The passage explicitly says ""Maemo ao go ona o tlogago o itemogela go robala ga nnete gomme mmele wa gago wa kaonafala goba go go tlwaelegego go thoma go ba bothata. **Se se no lapiša tše ekarego o tlo tsoga metsotso ye masomepedi goba masometharo a mangwe a mangwe le a mangwe go lebelela TV.**"" (This state is conducive to genuine sleep and your body may feel as if it's falling asleep, which prevents you from leaving for dozens or hundreds of minutes to watch TV.)

This means frequent screen use *reduces* REM sleep.  The other options are less directly supported by the text:

* **B: Boemo bja maatla (Muscle tone):** While muscle tone decreases during REM sleep, the passage doesn't focus on muscle tone specifically as a problem caused by screen use.
* **C: Botelele bja go fola bo re (Sleep latency):** Sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) isn't the primary issue highlighted in relation to screen use and REM suppression.
* **D: Nako magareng ga REM bo re (Time between REM):**  The passage doesn't discuss time intervals between REM cycles.

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that frequently using screens before bed shortens REM sleep.** REM sleep is crucial for proper rest and recovery.
* **Reduced REM sleep is directly linked to negative consequences.** The passage states this shortening can lead to difficulty sleeping properly and feeling unrefreshed even after prolonged screen time. 
* Options A and B are related to the *causes* of the problem (screen time affecting REM) not the *consequences*. 
* Option C, while a possibility, isn't a direct negative consequence of reduced REM sleep. It's a *type* of REM sleep, not a result of it being shortened.

Here's why:

* The text states that ""Maloko a sehlopa gantši a šoma bjalo ka lefelo la boikgokaganyo bakeng sa sehlopa sa ka pela sa go bonwa."" (Groups often function as a sounding board for their preceding governing body.)
* It also defines ""sehlopa sa go se bonwe"" (the invisible group) as ""sehlopa sa bolaodi seo maloko a begago go sona"" (the governing body that the groups look to).
* Therefore, both regular groups and marginalized groups ultimately report to an invisible governing body.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dihlopha tše ka bobedi di letetšwe go šoma maemong a go swana** (Both groups are ultimately expected to function in the same way) - The text highlights differences in how they function.
* **B: Dihlopha tše ka bobedi di na le maemo a go fapana a go ikemela mekgweng ya tšona ya letšatši ka letšatši** (Both groups have different positions that are independent of their daily routines) - The text doesn't focus on the independence of daily routines.
* **D: Dihlopha tše ka bobedi di šoma lefelong le tee la nako** (Both groups operate in the same time frame) - While they operate within a time frame, the text emphasizes their relationship to a governing body, not solely their time frame.

"Go ya ka temana, ke polelo efe mabapi le dihlopha tša mmele le tša go bonagala tšeo e sego tša nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Mafelo a nako ao a fapafapanego a ka hola dihlopha tša kgonthe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gantši di ba le maemo a go ipuša a mantši go feta maloko a sehlopa a go tlwaelega bjale ka ge sehlopa sa bona se ka kopana go ya ka dinako tša go fapana tša mafelo tšeo di ka no se kwešišegego ke bolaodi bja bona bja selegae.""

This means that changes in time (referring to different political climates or leadership) can significantly impact ""invisible groups"" (which are groups of leaders that individuals align themselves with).  This aligns directly with option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dihlopha tše di tlwaelegilego gantši di swarwa ka maemo a godimo:** The passage doesn't say that typical groups are positioned higher; it focuses on the dynamic relationship between individuals and leadership, particularly within ""invisible groups.""
* **B: Dihlopha tše ditlwaelegilego gantši di šoma bjalo ka ntlha ya kgokagano bakeng sa dihlopha tše di tlwaelegilego:** While the passage mentions groups aligning with leaders, it doesn't frame this as a general ""support structure"" for typical groups.
* **C: Dihlopha tše di tlwaelegilego di na le go ikemela mo gonyenyane go feta dihlopha tša kgonthe:** The passage doesn't provide information about the level of self-reliance of typical groups versus ""invisible groups.""

Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sego selo seo dithuto tša diteng di lebišitšwe go sona?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikganyogo tše di mpsha tšeo di bonagalago ge motho a godile (Emotional Vulnerabilities that are apparent when a person is older)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on motivations and needs driving behavior, especially related to personal growth and fulfillment.** Maslow's Hierarchy and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory deal with needs, motivation, and job satisfaction.
* **Option A, ""Emotional Vulnerabilities that are apparent when a person is older,"" is not a core concept addressed in the passage.** While emotions are important, the passage's focus is on fundamental needs and motivational theories, not specific emotional vulnerabilities tied to age.
* **Options B, C, and D directly relate to the theories discussed:**
    * **B: Ke ka tsela efe ya tikologo ya motho yeo e kgomago ditiro tša bona (How a person's environment enables their behavior):** This aligns with the idea of environmental factors influencing motivation, a key element in both Maslow's and Herzberg's theories.
    * **C: Dinyakwa tšeo di tsentšwego ka gare (Underlying Needs):**  This directly references the core concept of need fulfillment as central to Maslow's Hierarchy.
    * **D: Go kwešiša dilo tšeo batho ba di ratago (Understanding what people value):** This relates to Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory, which focuses on factors that contribute to job satisfaction and employee motivation.



Therefore, the option that *doesn't* fit within the scope of the passage is A.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sego selo sa pušo ya boraro?,"The correct answer is **B: Go hlola bophelo le maatla ka gare ga senepe** (Analyzing the life and strength within the shell).

Here's why:

* **The question describes the third layer of a Molao wa boraro (Law of Three) as focused on dynamism and change.** It mentions the core of the whole is a complex of three elements that can move up and down. This implies a focus on the *internal* workings and how they interact.
* **Option B, ""Go hlola bophelo le maatla ka gare ga senepe"" (Analyzing the life and strength within the shell), directly addresses this internal dynamism and energy.** It's about understanding the forces *within* the system that drive its change.
* **Options A, C, and D** are all focused on the *external* aspects of the structure:
    * **A: Go hlama motheo wa moo taba e tšweletšwago gona (Defining the core of the developing matter)** focuses on the initial stage of formation.
    * **C: Go boloka taba ya lefelong le itšego le le šomago (Maintaining the matter of the level and the working self)** focuses on stability and maintaining the existing structure.
    * **D: Go hloma thulaganyo ka gare ga senepe (Defining the quantity within the shell)** focuses on measuring the internal structure, but not necessarily its dynamism.



Therefore, option B is the only one that aligns with the description of the third layer's focus on internal dynamism and change.

Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa hlalošego sebopego sa go tšea diswantšho sa 35mm?,"The correct answer is **C: E na le tekanyo ya mahlakore a fapanego go feta dibopego tše ntši tšeo di tlwaelegilego** (It has a different aspect ratio than most commonly used formats).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Lemanoga la 35mm gabotse, ka tsela yengwe lea hlakahlakantša, 36mm ka bophara ka 24mm ka botelele. Lehlakore la teka-tekano ya lemanoga (go arogantša ka lesomepedi go hwetša teka-tekano ye bonolo ya nomoro ya go felelela) ke kafao le boletšwego goba 3:2. Mekgwa yeo e tlwaelegilego mentši (APS le gae la difomate, mohlala) e lekana goba e ka lekana le tekano ye ya karolo.""  This means 35mm doesn't adhere to the standard 3:2 aspect ratio used in many digital camera formats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E sa le tšweletšong** (It is not developing): This is irrelevant to the aspect ratio.
* **B: E ile ya amogelwa ke difomete tša khamera ya digital** (It has been adopted by digital camera formats): While 35mm *is* used in digital cameras, this doesn't explain its unusual aspect ratio.  It's the *ratio itself* that's different.
* **D: Ke sebopego se tlwaelegilego kudu ka lefaseng** (It is a very common format in the world): The passage implies 35mm is *not* as common as other formats, highlighting its difference.

"Go ya ka temana ye, ge batšweletši ba dula ba oketša boleng bja tšweletšo ya lense, dilense tša go godiša di kaonafaditšwe bjang?","The correct answer is **B: Di bonolo go di šomiša maemong a seetša se sennyane.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bothata bjo bongwe bja dikgalase tša go bonela kgauswi ke mafelelo a go bulega (lebelo) ga dikgalase ka mehla go ba fasana. Se se dira gore go šomiša dikgalase tša go gogelakgauswi go be boima ka gare ga maemo a seetša sa fae ntle le lebonethagi.""  This means wide-angle lenses are difficult to use in tight spaces.

* **The passage also implies:**  Wide-angle lenses are useful for capturing expansive scenes and creating a sense of depth. This implies they are *not* typically used in situations where precision and tight framing are required.

* **Options A, C, and D are incorrect:**
    * **A:**  The passage doesn't mention a higher maximum aperture for wide-angle lenses.
    * **C:** The passage specifically states that the image quality of wide-angle lenses isn't the same as those with a fixed focal length, and in some ways is inferior in terms of distortion.
    * **D:** While wide-angle lenses *can* have more complex mechanisms, the main difficulty isn't in their mechanical complexity, but in their usability in restricted spaces.



Therefore, the passage indicates that wide-angle lenses are *not* easy to use in tight spaces, making option B the most accurate.



"
"Go ya ka tsebišo ye mo temaneng,ke neng moo lense ya go godiša e ka kgethwago go feta lense ya prime?","The correct answer is **A: Ge e ba aperture ya godimodimo ke selo sa pele**.

Here's why:

The first paragraph states that ""Sa go se kgahliše ka dikgalase tša kgogelopele ke gore hlakahlakano ya thebo le palo ya dielement tša dikgalase tšeo di hlokegago go hwetša bontši bja botelele bja thebo go feta ga dikgalase tša prime.""  This means telephoto lenses generally have more elements and higher light gathering capability compared to prime lenses.

The second paragraph mentions the challenge of focusing with telephoto lenses, especially in low light.

Therefore, a key reason to choose a telephoto lens *over* a prime lens is for its superior light-gathering capabilities, specifically when a wider aperture (smaller f-number, like f/1.4 or f/2.8) is desired.  A wider aperture lets in more light, which is crucial for telephoto photography, particularly when dealing with potentially blurry focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ge o nyaka dielemente tša lense tše nnyane:**  Telephoto lenses generally have *more* elements, not fewer.
* **C: Ge e le gore ga o nyake go šomiša seetša sa peakanyong ya leswiswi:**  The need for peak sharpness isn't the defining factor for choosing a telephoto lens over a prime lens. Both can be sharp.
* **D: Ge e ba o nyakana le go raragana mo go oketšegilego kudu:** While telephoto lenses are good for isolating subjects with a shallow depth of field, this isn't the primary reason to choose them *over* a prime lens. A prime lens with a wider aperture could also achieve a shallow depth of field.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e bego e ka se tšeiwe bjalo ka tlhalošo yeo e nepagetšego ya bodumedi bja sephiri?,"The correct answer is **D: Go gatelelwa ga go tsoma phihlilelo ya motho ka noši yeo lebanego le go bapetšwa le dibopego tše dingwe tše dintši tša tumelo le borapedi bja bodumedi.**

Here's why:

The question asks what *would not* be considered part of the defined nature of spiritual enlightenment. The passage states that spiritual enlightenment differs from other forms of faith and guidance, particularly those focused on virtues like compassion, humility, gratitude, or a strong sense of the sacred.

Option D describes a focus on human judgment and external beliefs – things that the passage explicitly *contrasts* with the internal experience of spiritual enlightenment.  The passage emphasizes internal experiences like seeing beyond the physical or in dreams, and following paths to deepen that internal experience.  External beliefs and human judgment are not part of this definition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go na le kgatelelo ya go itemogela maemo a khutšo le a lethabo la temogo:** The passage mentions joy and gratitude as aspects of spiritual enlightenment.  Therefore, embracing feelings of joy and excitement is consistent with the definition.

* **B: Balatedi ba bodumedi bja diphiri ba nyaka go lemoga therešo ya moya wa temogo:** The passage says followers seek to deepen their internal experience and connect with something greater. This aligns with seeking truth about the spiritual realm.

* **C: Balatedi ba bodumedi bja diphiri bo amogela mekgwa yeo e tlago go thuša go godiša temogo ya bona ya therešo ya Modimo:**  The passage mentions following paths to deepen the internal experience, so embracing practices that aid in that growth is consistent with the definition.



Therefore, only option D represents a concept *outside* of the described definition of spiritual enlightenment.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sego nnete ka bodumedi bja diphiri?","The correct answer is **A: Go nyakega tlhaloganyo ka gare ga nnete ya Modimo** (It requires understanding of the true nature of God).

Here's why:

The passage states that Bodumedi bja Sephiri (Spirituality) doesn't necessarily require understanding the *true nature of God* to follow its paths. It emphasizes personal experiences, observation of the world, and connecting with the spiritual within oneself or the world around. While some may incorporate belief in God, it's not a fundamental requirement for practicing Bodumedi bja Sephiri.

The other options align with the passage's description of Bodumedi bja Sephiri:

*   **B: Go phegelela temogo ka maitemogelo ao a abelwago, a setšhaba** (To practice spirituality through shared, universal experiences) - The passage mentions observing the world and connecting with the spiritual within.
*   **C: Tšweletšo ya kgatelelo ya boemo bja lethabo bja temogo** (The development of the capacity for spiritual joy) - The passage mentions ""lethabo"" (joy) as a potential outcome or element.
*   **D: Go phegelela go lemoga Modimo ka temogo** (To practice spirituality through recognizing God) - While not a requirement, some people may connect with God through this path, which is acceptable.

Therefore, option A is the one that directly contradicts the passage's statement about Bodumedi bja Sephiri."
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo a ka bago a thomile mokgahlo wa temo?","The correct answer is **C: Batho ba Maori ba gotšwa Polynesia**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the theory that Māori people migrated from Polynesia in the Great Fleet and settled in New Zealand.
* While the passage also mentions the Moriori, it presents alternative theories about their origins and relationship to the Māori. 
* The primary theory presented in the passage attributes the establishment of the Māori language to the initial migration from Polynesia.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the information given.
"
"Go ya ka temana, sehlopha seo se bego se tsoma di moas e be e le badudi ba mathomo ba lefelo lefe?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

The text states: ""Bakeng sa nako ye telele nakong ya bo lesomesenyane le masomepedi, go be go dumelwa gore baagi ba pele ba New Zealand e be e le batho ba Maori..."" (For a very long time, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people...).
"
Ke boemong bofe bja gop diriša mokgwa wa Pureland wa oragami go be go tla hola foltara ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Foltara e rata go dira diphuthelwana tše di ntši ka nako e tee.**

Here's why:

The prompt states that Pureland origami groups are designed so that a single group (or a series of groups) can be completed within a specific time.  The core concept is about efficiency and minimizing the number of folds needed within a set timeframe.  Therefore, the pattern that emphasizes creating many folds in a short amount of time aligns with the Pureland philosophy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Foltara e na le bokgoni bjo bo tšwetšego pele bja go šišinya mmele:** While origami can create complex shapes, that's not the defining characteristic of Pureland.  It's about efficiency, not complexity.
* **C: Foltara e bopa origami yeo e nyakago diphuthelwana tša go bušetša morago:** The prompt explicitly mentions that Pureland groups *avoid* folds that require unfolding. This is the opposite of what option C suggests.
* **D: Foltara e lekile gatee goba gabedi fela pele:** Pureland isn't necessarily limited to two folds. The core principle is about managing folds within a time constraint, not restricting the total number of folds.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa hlalošego ka mo go nepagetšego ga origami ya naga ya pureland?,"The correct answer is **B: Mokgwa ga o akaretše diphuthelwana tša go bušetša morago.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Pureland origami *doesn't* involve ""folds that are made after the model has been opened."" This is a key characteristic of the technique and therefore not a characteristic *that is* explained in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E nepile mo go foltara tše di nago le phihlilelo** (It was perfected in folding paper with a beautiful design): While Pureland origami *is* about beautiful designs, the passage doesn't highlight this as the key, defining characteristic related to its development or purpose.
*   **C: Diphuthelwana di swanetše go ba le mafelo ao a otlologilego** (The folds required sharp edges):  The passage mentions the limited number of creases and the focus on making it accessible to those with less dexterity, not necessarily requiring sharp edges.
*   **D: Ke mokgwa o mobotse wa di foltara tšeo di nago le bokgoni bjo bo lekanyeditšwego bja go šišanya mmele** (It is an innovative method of folding paper with a refined ability to shape the body): While innovative, the passage doesn't specifically detail its innovative *method* beyond the constraint on the number of folds.

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that Pureland origami *doesn't* involve folds made after the model is opened, making option B the only incorrect one.



"
Go ya ka temana ke lefelo lefe leo le sa tswalanego le tlhabologo ya Indus Valley?,"The correct answer is **B: Noka ya Sarasvati**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ge ba badi ba dipuku ba bangwe ba gononwa gore ka ge hlabologo le yona e ile ya ba gona ka gare ga meedi ya Noka ya Sarasvati yeo ga bjale e omilego..."" This means the Indus Valley Civilization is thought to have existed *within* the Sarasvati Valley. Therefore, the Sarasvati Valley is closely associated with it, but not a separate, distinct civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Harappa:** The passage explicitly mentions Harappa as the first site of the Indus Valley Civilization to be unearthed.
* **C: Dilete ka moka tša ka leboa-bohlabela bja Afghanistan:**  The Indus Valley Civilization spanned a large area, including parts of Afghanistan, so these areas were *part of* the civilization, not separate from it.
* **D: Bontši bja Pakistan ya mehleng ya bjale:**  A significant portion of modern-day Pakistan is within the area occupied by the Indus Valley Civilization.



"
Ke fe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa bolelwago bjalo ka leina leo le ka bago gona la Tlhabologo ya mehla ya Bronze yeo e ahlaahlilwego mo temaneng ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Tlhabologo ya Indus-Sarasvati**.

The passage states: ""Ge ge ba badi ba dipuku ba bangwe ba gononwa gore ka ge hlabologo le yona e ile ya ba gona ka gare ga meedi ya Noka ya Sarasvati yeo ga bjale e omilego, mola ba bangwe ba e bitša **Hlabologo ya Indus-Sarasvati** ka morago ga Harappa...""

Therefore, Indus-Sarasvati is another name that has been proposed for the Indus Valley Civilization.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e tšweletšago mohola wa nako ye telele?","The correct answer is **A: Go dirišana le ba bangwe (Working together with others)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes collaboration:** The entire premise is about the benefits of working together (""go inaganela ka noši"" translates to ""collaborating"").  It states that when many people collaborate, opportunities become more abundant.
* **Option A directly reflects this:** ""Go dirišana le ba bangwe"" directly means ""Working together with others,"" which is the core message of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go etiša pele dikgahlego tša motho ka noši (Promoting human talent with noši):**  While talent is important, the passage doesn't focus on promoting individual talent specifically; it focuses on the collective power of collaboration.
* **C: Go gatelela seo se bego se tla hola bonnyane go feta bontši (Preventing something from growing smaller than the majority):** This is a convoluted and doesn't directly relate to the passage's focus on collaboration and abundant opportunities.
* **D: Go lemoga gore megabaru e ka ba go inaganela (Realizing that stars can be collaboration):** While stars *can* be a form of collaboration (like a constellation), the passage isn't about stars; it's about people collaborating.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that logically follows from the passage's central argument."
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke efe go tše di latelago yeo motho a ka e beago pele ge eba a nyaka go šetša mehola ya ka pela?","The correct answer is **C: Tšhomišano (Collaboration)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of collaboration (""tšhomišano-mmogo"") as the key to achieving success and realizing opportunities.  It states that when people collaborate, they find more resources and opportunities that wouldn't be available otherwise.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go ithata (Learning):** While learning is generally important, the passage doesn't specifically highlight it as the *immediate* first step when seeking opportunities.
* **B: Tirišano (Communication):** Communication is important for collaboration, but it's a component *of* collaboration, not the primary initial step emphasized in the text.
* **D: Go inaganela o nnoši (Networking):** Networking is related to collaboration but isn't the overarching theme presented. The text focuses on *working together* rather than just making connections.

Therefore, **tšhomišano (collaboration)** best reflects the core message of the passage regarding pursuing opportunities.



"
Go ya ka temana ke mang yo a ilego a akaretša karolo ye bohlokwa ya ditshenyagalelo tša ntwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Batho ba ma-Filipino**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditshenyagalelo tša ntwa ya mmušo wa kgapeletšo wa U.S. ya go tšala ba-Philippines morago di pateletšwe ke batho ba Filipino ka bo bona.""  This directly translates to ""The profits from the U.S. colonial government's mining of the Philippines were repatriated by Filipinos themselves.""

While the other options are involved, the passage emphasizes the role of Filipinos in handling and repatriating the profits. The passage also indicates that the profits ultimately benefited the U.S. government and Wall Street banks, but the *initial* repatriation was by Filipinos.
"
Ke nako efe yeo e tlilego pele ga ma-Templars?,"The correct answer is **B: Mengwaga ye lekgolo la bo 12**.

The text states that the High Middle Ages, the period in which the Templars rose to prominence, occurred between AD 1000 and 1300.  Therefore, the Templars rose to prominence in the **mid-12th century**.
"
Ke nako efe yeo e tlilego ka morago ga ngwaga ya ma-Templars?,"The correct answer is **C: Mengwaga ya magareng ya godimo (Upper Middle Ages)**.

The text states that the High Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries) was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.  Therefore, the period *after* the High Middle Ages is the Upper Middle Ages.
"
Ke kalafo efe goba tshepedišo efe ya tša kalafo yeo go sa bolelwago e le yeo e bego e dirišwa ke dingaka le dingaka tša go bua nakong ya Mmušo wa ma-Roman?,"The correct answer is **A: Go alafa bolwetši bja kgatelelo ya monagano ya morago ya masetla-pelo ka dihlare tše di fapafapanego tša go okobatša.**

Here's why:

The passage describes Roman doctors using various herbal remedies and techniques to treat wounds and injuries. Option A directly reflects this by mentioning the treatment of infected wounds with different types of dressings. The passage also alludes to the use of tourniquets and arterial claps (mentioned in option C), but the core emphasis on wound management and dressings aligns best with option A.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Go šomiša ditsopolwa tša dipeu tša herbane bakeng sa Scopolamine:** While the passage mentions scopolamine, it's not the primary focus of Roman wound treatment.
*   **C: Stemming go elela ga madi le ditšhika tša di-clamps:** This is part of the overall treatment but not the most encompassing answer.
*   **D: Go kgaola ditho tša batho bao ba nago le bolwetši bja gangrene:** Gangrene treatment is mentioned, but again, it's not the core focus of Roman wound management techniques as described in the passage.

Therefore, **A** best captures the general approach to wound care discussed in the passage."
Go ya ka temana ye ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa akaretšwago ke tšwelopele yeo e dirilwego lefapheng la tša kalafo nakong ya Mmušo wa ma-Roman?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebopego sa dipetlele tša go ithuta (Hospital systems for training)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes advancements in Roman medicine, including the establishment of hospitals for soldiers (which could be considered a form of training hospitals), the use of drugs, surgical techniques, and the growth of medical knowledge.

*   **A: Sebopego sa sehlopha sa bongaka (Medical guild system):** The passage doesn't explicitly mention a medical guild system.
*   **B: Molao wa sešole sa mmušo o bogale (Imperial school law):** While the emperor Augustus played a role in medicine, the passage doesn't specify a law regarding imperial medical schools.
*   **C: Sebopego sa dipetlele tša go ithuta (Hospital systems for training):** The passage mentions hospitals being used, especially for soldiers. While it doesn't detail *training* hospitals, it does mention the presence of hospitals.
*   **D: Mmuši wa go thwala dingaka (Medical training system):** The passage hints at training but doesn't describe a formalized medical training system.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C**."
Bokgoni bja go bona bo ithekgile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Bokgoni bja fapafapana bja go bona gabotse** (The ability to see clearly and accurately).

Here's why:

* The passage states that the ability to see depends on the proper functioning of the eye, including the cornea and lens.
* It then describes how different eye conditions affect this ability, leading to blurred or distorted vision.
* The key takeaway is that *good* vision relies on the eye's ability to function correctly and perceive things clearly.  This directly relates to ""bokgoni bja fapafapana bja go bona gabotse"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ditho tša dikwi tša tshepedišo ya pono** (The small parts of the vision system): While important, this is a component *of* the ability to see, not the ability itself.
* **B: Dinyakwa tša sephedi** (White spots):  These are symptoms of a condition affecting vision, not the definition of the ability.
* **C: Go kwagala go itšego ga botelele bja lephoto** (The proper alignment of the eyeball):  Proper alignment *contributes* to good vision, but it's not the encompassing definition of the ability itself.



"
Go fapana ga sebopego sa mahlo magareng ga diphedi go ithekgile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwagatšo ya botelele bja lephoto (Shape of the eyeball)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Mekgwa ya go aga ya go fapana e na le makgone a go fapana, e kgomega ka go fapanego ga mahlakore a botelele...""  This translates to ""The different ways of formation have different shapes, differing in the length of the eyeball..."" This directly links the shape of the eyeball to the differences in eye structure between species.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Dinyakwa tša diphedi (Pupil size):** While pupil size can vary, the passage focuses on the overall *shape* of the eye, not just the pupil.
* **C: Boemo bja acuity (Level of sharpness of vision):** Acuity is related to the retina and other internal structures, not primarily the overall shape of the eyeball.
* **D: Go raragana ga diphedi (Separation of eyes):** Eye separation can vary, but the passage highlights the *form* of the eye itself as the key differentiating factor.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ma-Sikhs a bona sedumedi sa bona e le seo le aroganego go tšwa go Hinduism le ge ba dumela medu le setlogo tša sona tša se-Hindu.""  This means Sikhism *does not* build upon Hinduism; it distinguishes itself *from* Hinduism. Options A, B, and C are all supported by the passage.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke fe ya tše di latelago yeo e tšewago e le karolo ya motheo ya tshepedišo ya tumelo ya Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Kgopolo ya go ya guru (The concept of the guru)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Guru ke karolo ye kgolo ya ditumelo ka moka tša ma-India efela Sikhism e bohlokwa moo e lego karolo ya motheo ya ditumelo tša Sikh."" This translates to ""The Guru is a major part of the overall beliefs of India, but Sikhism considers it a core part of its beliefs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditšo tša Hindu (Hindu traditions):** The passage says Sikhs consider themselves distinct from Hinduism, even though they acknowledge some aspects.
* **C: Go gana go amogela bodumedi bjo bongwe bja India (Refusal to accept other beliefs of India):** The passage doesn't suggest a refusal of other beliefs; it emphasizes Sikhism's distinct identity.
* **D: Go bolela leleme la Se Punjabi (Speaking the Punjabi language):** While Punjabi is associated with Sikhism, the passage doesn't mention the language itself as a core belief.

The text explicitly states: ""Bana bao ba nago ke ADD ba swara boima go šetša mošomo wa sekolo..."" (Children who have ADD struggle with schoolwork...).

While the text mentions other aspects of ADD (like difficulty concentrating, acting out, etc.), the most direct struggle mentioned is with schoolwork.

The text states: ""ADD e ama dikamano le ditaka tše dingwe ka lebaka la gore bana ba bangwe ga ba kgone go kwešiša gore ke ka lebaka la eng ba iswara ka tsela ye ba iswarago ka gona goba ka lebaka la eng ba peleta ka moo ba peletago ka gona goba gore maemo a bona a go butšwa kgopolong a fapane."" This translates to: ""ADD affects relationships and other emotions because other children cannot understand why they behave in a certain way or why they become frustrated or why their situation is interpreted differently in the classroom.""

It then says: ""itsentšha ka gare ga maitshwaro a kotsi, ba tsena ka gare ga dintwa, gomme ba hlotla molao"" which translates to: ""engage in risky behaviors, get into trouble, and break the law.""

The text links risky behaviors (and getting into trouble/breaking the law) to difficulties understanding emotional cues and feeling frustrated.  Therefore, the lack of ability to process emotions and frustration leads to risky behavior, which is connected to ""mafolofolo a feteletšego"" (fidgeting/restlessness - a symptom often associated with ADD).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go ba thuša go kgokagana le dithaka:** While helping manage emotions is important, the text *directly* connects emotional difficulty to engaging in risky behavior, not just struggling with frustration.
* **C: Go hwetša hlokomelo gotšwa go batswadi ba bona:** The text doesn't focus on parental support as the *reason* for risky behavior. It highlights internal processing difficulties.
* **D: Go hlohleletša bjoko bja bona:**  While behavior modification is a potential intervention, the text doesn't frame it as the *"
"Go ya ka tshedimošo yeo e le go mo temaneng, ke efe ya tšeo di latelago e sego mohlala wa scaffolding?","The correct answer is **B: Mohlahli wa SAT**.

Here's why:

* **Scaffolding** provides temporary support to help learners master a new skill. It's about breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps and offering guidance.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Thuto mathomong a papadi ya khomphutha:** While a computer programming class *could* use scaffolding, the description doesn't specify that it *must*. It's a general course.
* **B: Mohlahli wa SAT:** The SAT is a standardized test designed to *assess* knowledge, not to provide support or temporary structure for learning. It's a measurement tool, not a scaffolding tool.
* **C: Lenaneo leo le ikemetšego:** An independent program wouldn't typically provide scaffolding; it's designed for self-directed learning.
* **D: Mohlahli yo monnyane wa liki:**  A grammar checker provides feedback but doesn't offer the ongoing, adaptable support characteristic of scaffolding.

Therefore, the SAT is the only option that clearly doesn't fit the description of scaffolding.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa hlalošego gabotse kgopolo ya scaffolding?,"The correct answer is **D: Di-scaffolds di šomišwa go fa thekgo mathomong a maitemogelo a go ithuta.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Scaffolding ga se mokgwa wa go ithuta efela ke thušo yeo e abelanago ka thekgo go batho bao ba lego ka gare ga maitemogelo a go ithuta go goswa bjalo ka go šomiša lenaneo la khomputa goba go thoma projeke ye ntswa."" This means scaffolding provides support **within** the learning process, not as a separate learning method.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Scaffolds di ka ba gona mo go nyakilego go ba gona:** While true that scaffolding can be helpful, this doesn't explain the *core* concept of what scaffolding *is*.
* **B: Ke thuto ye ntši go feta mokgwa wa go ithuta:** The passage says scaffolding is *not* just another learning method; it's a support system *within* learning.
* **C: E tsebja gape bjalo ka thuto ye e theilwego godimo ga diprotšeke:** While scaffolding *is* related to problem-based learning, the passage focuses on it providing support within the problem-solving process.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke diripa dife tša MySpace yeo e ka holago baithuti bao ba nago le bothata bja go bala?","The correct answer is **C: Aterese ye tee ya wepe**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the website address (aterese ya wepe) allows students who have difficulty using a computer to easily access and save information. The text highlights that sharing a link is a key feature for easier access and note-taking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tlwaetšo ya gago (Your adaptation):** While MySpace allows for customization, it's not the primary feature helping students with reading difficulties.
* **B: Diboloko (Features):**  This is too broad. While MySpace has features, the text focuses on the link/address specifically for students with reading difficulties.
* **D: Diprofaele tše dimilione tše 54 (The 54 million profiles):** The number of profiles is irrelevant to helping students with reading difficulties.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e bego e se karolo ya phetholo ya Krushchev go meferefere ya bašomi?","The correct answer is **D: Amogela dinyakwa tše dingwe tša boiphedišo (Accepting other demands for autonomy)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the initial protests in Poland in June 1956 started over food shortages and economic issues, but then evolved into a protest against Communism.
* Krushchev responded by sending tanks to suppress the uprising.
* Ultimately, he allowed Wladyslaw Gomulka, a figure who was popular among the Polish people, to become leader. This was a significant concession to Polish autonomy and allowed for some degree of self-governance.
* Options A, B, and C are things Krushchev *didn't* do:
    * **A: Go kgetha tonakgolo ye mpsha (Appointing a hardliner leader):** Krushchev chose Gomulka, who was considered more moderate.
    * **B: Go diriša ditanka go bušetša thulaganyo (Using tanks to suppress the uprising):**  While he *did* use tanks initially, the ultimate outcome involved concessions, not just suppression.
    * **C: Oketša go fokotšwa ga megolo (Continuing to reduce subsidies):** The passage indicates that one of the initial issues was *reducing* subsidies, not continuing to do so.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting Krushchev's final actions regarding the Polish people's demands is accepting other demands for autonomy.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago e bego e se sebakwa sa meferefere kua Poland?,"The correct answer is **A: Bokomonisi (Communism)**.

The text states that the protests in Poland in June 1956 initially started due to food shortages and cuts in rations, but then *evolved into a protest against Communism*. Wladyslaw Gomulka's rise to power was a result of this anti-Communist sentiment.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa amago dikamano magareng ga USSR le USA?","The correct answer is **B: Dikgopolo mabapi le Germany** (Rumors about Germany).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Cold War began *after* WWII, fueled by distrust and ideological differences.** The core of the Cold War was the ideological clash between communism (USSR) and capitalism (USA).
* **The passage emphasizes proxy wars across the globe.** This highlights the *actions* of the two superpowers influencing events worldwide.
* **Rumors about Germany are a distraction.** While the events of WWII involving Germany were crucial *to the start* of the Cold War, the question asks what *didn't* contribute to the tensions *during* the Cold War itself.  Rumors about Germany don't directly explain the sustained conflict and proxy wars.
* **The other options are all relevant to the Cold War:**
    * **Diphapano tša setšo (Ideological differences):**  This is *the* fundamental cause of the Cold War.
    * **Ditshepetšo tšeo di fapanego (Different political systems):** This is a direct result of the ideological differences.
    * **Dingangišano mabapi le ditshepedišo (Disagreements about deployments):** Proxy wars involved disagreements about where and how to deploy forces.



Therefore, rumors about Germany are the least directly relevant factor in explaining the ongoing tensions and conflicts of the Cold War as described in the passage.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa hlalošego ka mo go nepagetšego morero wa go romela tshepedišo ya methapo ya ditšhika ka gare ga mmele?,"The correct answer is **B: Go laola go elela ga madi (To regulate blood flow)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the circulatory system sends signals to regulate blood flow within the body to ensure it's consistent.** The core purpose of sending these signals is to *control* how blood moves.
* **Option A (Go diegiša go elela ga madi - To maintain blood supply)** is partially correct, but ""regulate"" is a more precise and encompassing term.  Maintaining blood supply is *part of* regulation.
* **Option C (Go boloka homeostasis - To maintain homeostasis)** is too broad. While regulating blood flow *contributes* to homeostasis, it's not the specific reason for sending the signals.  The signals are specifically *for* regulating blood flow.
* **Option D (Go phema ditšhošetšo tšeo di ka bago gona mmeleng - To prevent conditions that might arise in the body)** is also too broad.  While regulating blood flow helps prevent problems, it's not the direct purpose of sending the circulatory signals.



Therefore, **regulating blood flow** is the most accurate and specific reason for the circulatory system sending signals to blood vessels within the body.
"
Ke eng seo se ka hwetšwago kua The Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **D: Pyramid ye kgolo**.

The text explicitly states: ""The Giza Plateau, goba """"""Giza Necropolis"""""""" go la Egyptian Valley of the Dead e na le di pyramids tše mmalwa (moo e lego gore the great pyramid ke yona ye kgolokgolo)..."" This translates to: ""The Giza Plateau, also known as the ""Giza Necropolis,"" is in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead and has several pyramids (where the great pyramid is the largest)...""
"
Morero wa Pyramid ye kgolo e be e le ofe?,"The correct answer is **B: Go hlompha Pharaoh**.

The text clearly states: ""The great pyramid e hlotšwe go hlompha Pharaoh Khufu..."" which translates to ""The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...""
"
Ke mang yo a tšeago maikarabelo ka tsebo ya rena ka mothuši wa go fiša tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Baefeso**.

The text states: ""Baefeso, ba kwatile, ba begile gore leina la Herostratus ga sa ka la rekotwa."" which translates to ""The Ephesians, enraged, wished that the name of Herostratus should not be remembered."" This indicates they were the ones who wanted to suppress the memory of the person who burned down the temple.
"
Ke polelo efe yeo e nepagetšego mabapi le go agwa leswa ga tempele ya Artemis,"The correct answer is **B: E ile ya agwa leswa ka morago ga pušo ya Alexander yo mogolo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tempele e sentšwe bošegong bjo tee bjoo Alexander the Great a belegweng ka bona. Alexander, bjalo ka kgoši, o neetše ka go lefela go agaleswa tempele, efela moneelo wa gagwe o gannwe. Ka morago, ge Alexander a hlokofetše, tempele e agilweleswa ka 323 BCE.""

This clearly indicates that the temple was rebuilt *after* Alexander the Great's death (323 BCE). Option B accurately reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go agwa leswa go ile gwa lefša ka Alexander o Mogolo:** While Alexander desired to fund the temple, his death prevented it. He didn't personally fund the rebuilding.
* **C: Herostratus o ile a laelwa gore a lefe ditshenyagalelo tša go aga leswa:** Herostratus was *blamed* for the destruction, not tasked with rebuilding it.
* **D: E ile ya agwa leswa ka 320 BCE:** The passage states 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.



"
"Go ya temana ye, go bile neng ya mathomo yeo mohuta o ka bago o sepetše ka maoto a mabedi?","The correct answer is **A: Mengwaga ye dimilione tše šupago ya go feta**.

The text states: ""ge Sahelanthropus e ka ba e sepetše ka maoto a mabedi ka pele go tloga mengwaga ye dimilion tše šupa ya go feta."" (Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 6 million years ago.)
"
Ke efe ya mehuta ye e bego e sepela ka mehla ka maoto a mabedi?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that *Homo Erectus* is the first known hominin to walk upright regularly, dating back millions of years.
* While *Sahelanthropus* might have walked bipedally, the text doesn't say they did so regularly.
* *Australopithecus* is mentioned as not walking upright as consistently as *Homo Erectus*.
* ""Dikgethegilego tša Biopedal"" (Bipedal Ancestors) is a general term, not a specific species.

Therefore, *Homo Erectus* is the most accurate answer based on the information provided.
"
Ke eng seo madira a ka lewatleng a German a bego a leka go se fihlilela nakong ya ntwa ya II ya lefase,"The correct answer is **A: Go thibela dithoto tšeo di tšwago Britain.**

The passage states that German U-boats were trying to stop the flow of people and supplies across the Atlantic to Britain. This is the core of their objective during WWII.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimošo yeo e filwego temaneng,ke mang yo a bilego le katlego ye kgolo ka ntwa ya madira a ka lewatleng nakong ya lesolo la North Atlantic?","The correct answer is **A: British le Ma-Amerika**.

The passage states that the North Atlantic campaign was about the Americans trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain, and the German U-boats trying to stop them.  The passage also highlights the importance of the campaign and the potential consequences if the Allies had lost. Therefore, both the British and the Americans were involved and had a significant role in the outcome.

While the Germans were a major force, the Allies (British and Americans) ultimately prevailed in the North Atlantic campaign.
"
Ke eng seo se bego se se gona ge Ma-Assyrians ba be ba phethagatša tšhomišo ya sefapano?,"The correct answer is **A: Di-saddle**.

The passage states: ""Sala e be e sešo ya dirwa, kafao banamedi ba dipere ba ntwa ba Assyria ba lwele ba le godimo ga mekokotlo ya dipere tša bona e se a apešwa **selo**."" This translates to: ""The saddle became a weapon, as Assyrian boatmen fought from above their boats not having a **saddle**.""

Therefore, the Assyrians used saddles as a strategic advantage in warfare.
"
Dintwa tšeo di dirišago sefapano di lwewa bjang?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka pere ya go namela (By using catapults)**.

The passage states: ""Sala e be e sešo ya dirwa, kafao banamedi ba dipere ba Assyria ba lwele ba le godimo ga mekokotlo ya dipere tša bona e se a apešwa selo."" This translates to: ""The siege became a sight of destruction, as Assyrian siege engineers battled above their own siege engines that were not dismantled.""  The passage describes the use of siege engines, which were essentially catapults or similar devices used to launch projectiles.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae moo o bego o kase hwetše moagi wa Babylonian yo a tlwaelegilego?","The correct answer is **D: Ka go tliša dihlabelo lefelong le lekgethwa la ka gare.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Batho ba be ba tliša dihlabelo go badimo gomme baporista ba be ba tla leka go ela dinyakwa tša badimo hloko ka meletlo le mekete."" (People would bring offerings to the gods and priests would try to interpret the gods' will through omens and lotteries.)

It also mentions: ""Tempele yenngwe le yenngwe e butše lapa le lefelo la ka gare leo go ka tsenago baruti fela."" (Each temple had a courtyard and a inner sanctuary which only priests could enter.)

Therefore, a typical Babylonian priest would be found bringing offerings to the temple and entering the inner sanctuary. Option D best reflects this.
"
Ke tše dife ya tše di latelago yeo e bego e beetšwe baperisita ka mo go kgethegilego?,"The correct answer is **C: Meletlo (Priests)**.

The passage states: ""Bato ba be ba tliša dihlabelo go badimo gomme baporista ba be ba tla leka go ela dinyakwa tša badimo hloko ka meletlo le mekete."" This translates to: ""People would bring offerings to the gods and priests would try to interpret the will of the gods through sacrifices and divination."" Therefore, priests are explicitly mentioned as interpreting the will of the gods *through sacrifices* (meletlo).
"
Naa kgoši Tutankhamun o ile a tuma neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka morago ga go utollwa ga lebitla la gagwe**.

The passage states: ""Efela, go hwetšagala ga lebitla la gagwe ka 1922 go mo dirile setsebalegi."" (Only the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.) This clearly indicates his fame and recognition came *after* the discovery of his tomb.
"
Ke eng seo se dirilego gore Kgoši Tutankhamun e be Moegipita yo a tsebegago kudu?,"The correct answer is **A: Go utollwa ga lebitla la gagwe leo le sa šitišwego (The discovery of his largely intact tomb)**.

The passage explicitly states that Tutankhamun wasn't particularly important during his lifetime, but his tomb's discovery in 1922 made him famous. The intact nature of the tomb, filled with treasures, is the key reason for his fame.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Boemo bja gagwe mananeong a bogologolo a kgoši (His status as a king in his lifetime):** The passage says he wasn't considered important *during* his lifetime.
* **C: Go thubja ga dilo tše dikete tša kgale lebitleng la gagwe (The looting of ancient items in his tomb):**  The passage mentions the tomb was *not* looted and remained undisturbed.
* **D: Bohlokwa bja gagwe mehleng ya bogologolo ya Egipita (His importance in ancient Egyptian times):** Again, the passage indicates he wasn't highly important during his reign.



"
Ke eng seo seriti sa Mo-Greek Homer se bego se sa kgone go se dira?,"The correct answer is **C: Go sepela (To see)**.

The passage states that Homer is known for composing the epic poems *Iliad* and *Odyssey*.  It doesn't mention anything about Homer being unable to see. The other options don't fit the context either.
"
Ke mo-Greek ofe yo a tsebjago ka selo se sengwe ntle le dipuku?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

The question asks who is known for something *other* than literature. While Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes were all famous writers, Pythagoras is known for his mathematical theorem.
"
Laba la Ma-Hebrew le be le fetša nako e ntši kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Mo moyeng o bulegilego** (In spirit).

The passage states: ""Bontši bja bophelo bja lapa la Hebrew bo diragetše moyeng."" which translates to ""Much of the life of the Hebrew family took place in spirit.""

The other options don't accurately reflect what the text says:

* **B: Mo mmileng** (In wealth): While wealth was present, the text focuses on spiritual life, not material wealth.
* **C: Ka jarateng** (At the same time/Currently): The passage refers to a historical period.
* **D: Ka ntlong** (At home):  While life did happen at home, the passage emphasizes the spiritual aspect of their lives.



"
Ke eng seo se bego se se bohlokwa kudu go le lapa la Hebrew?,"The correct answer is **C: Legae la bona (Their home)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Boemong bja boso bja go ruthela bja Bogare bja Bohlabela, ntlo e be e se bohlokwa ga kalo."" This translates to ""In the eyes of the ancestors who ruled the whole world, the home was the most important thing.""

While the other options are mentioned, the passage clearly emphasizes the significance of the *home* to the Hebrew family.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa hlalošwego e le phapano magareng ga dinaga tša Scandinavian?,"The correct answer is **A: Histori**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Le ge naga yengwe le yengwe e be e le 'Scandinavian', go be go na le diphapano tše dintši gare ga batho, dikgoši, mediro le **histori** ya Denmark, Sweden, Norway le Iceland.""

While the other options (Naga - Land, Meetlo - Customs, Batho - People) are mentioned as having differences, the passage specifically highlights history as a key area of divergence between the Scandinavian countries.
"
Ke mang a ilego a dula Greenland pele?,"The correct answer is **A: Meloko ya ma-Eskimo**.

The passage states: ""Efela go sa šetšwe seo a se utullotšego, mehlobo ya ma-Eskimo e be e šetše e dula moo ka nako yeo."" This translates to ""However, what wasn't known is that the Eskimo people had already been living there for a long time.""
"
Ke sehlopha sefe seo se ka ratago go ja ntle le ditulo?,"The correct answer is **C: Banna ba ba humilego ba Roma (Traveling men of Rome)**.

The text states: ""go akaretšwa kolobe ya lešoka, phikoko, kgopa, le mohuta wa kokoni wa go bitšwa legotlo la nageng Phapano yengwe e be e le gore ka nako ye batho ba go hloka le mosadi ba be a eja dijo tša bona ba dutši ditulong, **banna ba ba humi ba ratile go ba le dijo tše dintši mmogo moo ba ka dulago ka mahlakore a bona.**"" 

This translates to: ""including lentils, barley, beans, and a type of cooking pot called a cauldron. Another difference was that when people needed food and a woman, they ate their food while sitting on stools, **traveling men wanted to have a lot of food together so they could travel for many miles.**""



"
Ke fe ya tše di latelago yeo e bego e kase be karolo ya monyanya wa bogologolo wa Roma?,"The correct answer is **D: Sebjana sa lekalakune le le bešitšwego (A roasted piglet)**.

The passage states: ""go akaretšwa kolobe ya lešoka, phikoko, kgopa, le mohuta wa kokoni wa go bitšwa legotlo la nageng Phapano yengwe e be e le gore ka nako ye batho ba go hloka le mosadi ba be a eja dijo tša bona ba dutši ditulong, banna ba ba humi ba ratile go ba le dijo tše dintši mmogo moo ba ka dulago ka mahlakore a bona.

Bakeng sa mohlala, ba se na mafela, goba ditamati, goba ditapola, goba khoukhou ebile ga go Moroma wa kgale wo a ilego a latswa lekalakune.""

This translates to: ""including a roasted pig, poultry, meat, and a type of cooking pot called a *legatio*. Another difference was that when people were in need, a woman would eat their food sitting on the floor, while traveling men liked to have a lot of food together where they could travel for hours. Ancient Roman foods could include those that came to Europe from America or Asia in many later centuries. For example, they did not have beef, or turkeys, or chickens, or ducks, and there was an ancient Roman who was roasted on a spit.""

Therefore, a roasted piglet (sebjana sa lekalakune le le bešitšwego) was part of the ancient Roman diet. The other options are not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo go sa bonagalego e tla ba le khuetšo ya go ya go ile?","The correct answer is **A: Setšhaba (Nation)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the origin and significance of the word ""nation"" (setšhaba). It states that a nation is a large group of people living and working together. The passage emphasizes the historical and cultural significance of the term.

The question asks which of the options is *least* likely to have a similar historical and cultural weight (khuetšo ya go ya go ile) to the word ""nation"".

*   **Setšhaba (Nation):** The passage directly describes it as having a deep history and cultural importance.
*   **Setšo se sennyane (Small symbol/sign):** These typically don't carry the same historical weight as a nation.
*   **Mmušo wa toropo (Town government):** While important, it's a specific governing body within a nation, not the nation itself.
*   **Setšo sa tlhabologo (Emblem/logo):**  Emblems can be significant, but they generally represent a nation or organization, not the nation itself.

Therefore, a ""small symbol"" (setšo se sennyane) is the least likely option to have the same level of historical and cultural weight as ""setšhaba.""



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo seo se tlago pele ga setšhaba?","The correct answer is **A: Setšo sa tlhabologo (The coat of arms)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Setšo sa tlhabologo se šupa go fetišetša tsebo go ditšhaba tše mmalwa, mohlala wa setšo woo o šalago le phatlaloso yeo e lokilego."" This translates to ""The coat of arms aims to represent the knowledge of various nations, for example, a flag and a proper proclamation.""  The passage then goes on to say that coats of arms often carry the weight of history and are remembered as historical legacies.  This clearly indicates the coat of arms is the most prominent element discussed as representing the nation.
"
Ke polelo efe mabapi le Drukgyal Dzong yeo e sego ya therešo?,"The correct answer is **C: Mollo o ile wa senya bontši bja mašaledi sebo (The king built many walls of the Dzong).**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""A 1951, mollo o dirile gore go šale fela mašaledi a drukgyal Dzong, bjale ka seswantšho sa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""  This translates to ""In 1951, the king ensured that the walls of Drukgyal Dzong remained intact, but in the tradition of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel."" This indicates the *king* maintained the walls, not built them.
* **The other options are accurate according to the text:**
    * **A: E agilwe ka lebaka la go keteka phenyo ya madira a Tibetan-Mongol (It was built in memory of the king's Tibetan-Mongol expedition):** The text directly states this.
    * **B: E beilwe ka Bhutan (It is located in Bhutan):**  The text clearly states this.
    * **D: E hlotšwe ke Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (It was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel):** The text states that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the Dzong.



Therefore, option C is the only statement that contradicts the provided text.

The passage states: ""Ka 1951, mollo o dirile gore go šale fela mašaledi a drukgyal Dzong, bjale ka seswantšho sa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel."" This translates to: ""In 1951, the king restored the walls of Drukgyal Dzong, but to the memorial of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""  This means the restoration was *in honor of* or *as a memorial to* Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Madira a Tibet Mongol a ile a fenya:** The passage mentions Tibetan-Mongol designs were used in the construction, but it doesn't say they were ""restored"" or ""destroyed"" by the king.
* **C: Go tuma ga maatla kgogedi ga se ya ka ya amega:** This translates to ""The claiming of power is not always legitimate."" This is completely unrelated to the passage's content.
* **D: E ile ya bolokwa ke Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** The passage says the Dzong was *restored* by the king, *to the memorial* of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel. It doesn't say Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel maintained it afterward.

Ke efe ya dipolelo tše di latelago mabapi le Cambodia yeo e lego therešo?,"The correct answer is **C: Cambodia e ile ya hlaselwa kae ma-Vietnamese mathomong mengwaga ye lekgolo ya bo 18**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text states:** ""Ngwageng ya mafelelo ya ngwagakgolo wa bo 18 ma-Vietnamese le wona a ile a hlasela Cambodia."" (In the late 18th century, the Vietnamese also attacked Cambodia.)
* **Option C accurately reflects this statement.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ma-Vietnamese a ile a senya Phnom Phen:**  The text says the Thais sacked Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.
* **B: Cambodia e ile ya hlasela Thailand ka 1772:** The text states the Thais attacked Cambodia in 1772.
* **D: Ma-Thais a ile a senya Phnom Phen:** The text states the Thais *attacked* Phnom Penh, but the text explicitly says the Thais sacked the city, not that they *sacked* it.
"
Ke efe ya dipolelo tše di latelago yeo e hlalošago ka mo go nepagetšego ka ditlhaselo tša Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **D: Ma-Thailand a ile a hlasela Cambodia makga a mmalwa**.

Here's why:

* The first sentence of the provided text states: ""Ma-Thais a hlasetše Cambodia makga a mmalwa ka ngwagakgolo wa bo 18..."" (The Thais attacked Cambodia several times in the 18th century...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ma-Vietnamese a ile a hlasela Cambodia ka makga a mmalwa:** While the Vietnamese did attack Cambodia in the late 18th century, the text specifically mentions the Thais attacking *several times* earlier in the century. This option doesn't capture the primary point of the first sentence.
* **B: Ma-Thailand le ma-Vietnamese a ile a hlasela Cambodia ka 1772:** The text mentions Thailand attacking *several times* in the 18th century, but doesn't specifically state that both Thailand and Vietnam attacked in 1772.
* **C: Ma-Vietnamese a ile a senya Phnom Phen:** The text states that the Thais destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772, not the Vietnamese.

The text explicitly states: ""Ka 1624, Khampane ya Dutch Bohlabela bja India e dirile motheo go la borwabodikela bja taiwan, **šišinya phetogo ka gare ga tšweletšo ya dithoro gomme ya twala bašomi ba ma China go šoma difekoring tša yona tša raese le sukiri.**"" (In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a stronghold on Taiwan, shifting focus to sugar cultivation and **brought in Chinese laborers to work in its sugar factories**.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E ba le motheo karolong ya borwa-bodikela bja sehlakahlaka** (Established a stronghold in the northern part of the island) - This is true, but it doesn't represent something the Dutch *didn't* do. It was a key action they took.
* **B: Dira tšweletšo ya mabele a setlogo** (Developed large-scale plantations) - This is true, and the text mentions it directly.
* **D: Go ikemišetša ka taolo ya Taiwan go Lešika la bogoši bja Qing** (Commit to control of Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty) - This is incorrect. The text details how Taiwan *passed* to the Qing Dynasty and then to Japan, not the other way around.



"
Naa tumelelano ya Shimonoseki e hlomilwe eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Taolo ya Japane godimo ga Taiwan**.

The passage clearly states: ""ka 1895, ka morago ga phenyo Ntweng ya Pele ya Sino-Japane (1894-1895), mmušo wa Qing o saena Tumelelano ya Shimonoseki, ka yeo e neelago pušo godimo ga Taiwan go Japane, yeo e laolago sehlakahlaka go fihla ka 1945.""  This directly translates to Japan gaining control of Taiwan.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the treaty involved China and Japan, it didn't simply result in Japan gaining part of China.
* **B:** Taiwan was a Qing province *before* the treaty. The treaty *changed* that.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention Taiwan regaining control later. It was under Japanese control until 1945.



"
Boemo bja PH bja khemikhale bo lekantšwe bjang?,"The correct answer is **C: Palo ya di-ion tša Hydrogen ka gare ga khemikhale**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Maemo a pH a laetšwa ke palo ya Hydrogen (H+) ions ka gare ga teko ya khemikhale.""  This translates to ""The pH level is determined by the number of Hydrogen (H+) ions in the chemical test.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka moo khemikhale e lego ya motheo goba ya esiti ka gona** (Where the chemical is an acid or a base) - While acids and bases *influence* pH, they don't *define* it. pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions.
*   **B: Ke diprothone tše kae tšeo di lego ka gare ga khemikhale** (Where the protons are located in the chemical) - Protons (H+) are related to hydrogen ions, but the passage refers to the *number* of ions, not their location.
*   **D: Ke di-elektrone tše kae tšeo di lego ka gare ga khemikhale** (Where the electrons are located in the chemical) - Electrons are irrelevant to the pH level. pH is determined by the hydrogen ion concentration.



"
Ke eng seo se ilego sa tlošwa go tšwa go di-ion tša Hydrogen?,"The correct answer is **A: Diprothone**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maemo a pH a laetšwa ke palo ya Hydrogen (H) ions ka gare ga teko ya khemikhale. Haedrotšene ya diayone ke diprothone tšeo di ntšhitšwego dieletrone tša tšona..."" This directly links hydrogen ions (H+) to protons.  Protons are the core of an atom and are what hydrogen ions are when they lose their electron.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH:** pH is the *measure* of hydrogen ion concentration, not the ions themselves.
* **C: Alkaline:** Alkaline describes a solution's characteristic (basic) and is not directly derived from hydrogen ions.
* **D: Di-Elektrone (Electrons):**  While hydrogen ions *lose* electrons, the passage specifically identifies the *protons* as the ions themselves.



"
Ke efe ya dipolelo tše di latelago yeo e sa hlalošego ka nepo boikgantšho bja di-ion?,"The correct answer is **B: Tekanyetšo ya banna go basadi ga e lekalekane**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Mekgobo ya ditau e dirilwe tau ka monna o tee goba tša banna ba bararo ba go tswalana, ga mmogo le bonši ba go lekana masometharo a ditau tša basadi le ditawana."" (A lion pride is made up of one male or three males who are related, along with an equal number of female lions and cubs.) This directly contradicts option B, which states the ratio is equal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di itshwara ka go swana le diphuthelwana tša dimpša** (They behave similarly to wolf packs) - The text compares lion prides to wolf packs, so this is a plausible statement.
* **C: Banna le basadi ka moka ba tswalana kudu** (Males and females reproduce a lot together) - The text states females reproduce more frequently.
* **D: Bobedi bja tšona di a bolaya e bile di na le leago** (Both of them hunt and have a den) - The text mentions lions hunt and have a den, so this is also a plausible statement.



Therefore, only option B directly contradicts information given in the text.



"
Ke efe ya dipolelo tše di latelago yeo e sa hlalošego ka nepo boitshwaro bja di-ion?,"The provided text describes the behavior of meerkats (dikatse tša go ba le bogwera). The question asks which of the following options *doesn't* accurately describe their behavior. Let's analyze each option:

* **A: Di na le leago kudu (They are very sociable)** - The text explicitly states meerkats live in large groups called mobs, and these mobs consist of three males and up to seven females and their offspring. This indicates a very social animal.

* **B: Boitshwaro bja tšona bo bapetšwa le bja diphiri (Their behavior is similar to that of foxes)** - The text compares meerkats to foxes, hyenas, and other animals with similar behavioral patterns, particularly noting their cautious nature and tendency to be wary of predators. This suggests similar behavior.

* **C: Bobedi bja tša tona le tshadi di bolaya kudu go di bolawa (Half of their offspring and the mother are often killed)** - This statement suggests a high rate of mortality among young meerkats and the mother. The text doesn't mention this.

* **D: Boitshwaro bja tšona bjo swana le dikatse tše dingwe tše di kgolo (Their behavior is similar to other large cats)** -  While meerkats are related to cats, the text emphasizes their unique social behavior and cautious nature, differing from many other large cats.  It doesn't say their behavior is *similar* to all other large cats.

Therefore, the option that *doesn't* accurately describe the behavior of meerkats based on the text is **C: Bobedi bja tša tona le tshadi di bolaya kudu go di bolawa (Half of their offspring and the mother are often killed)**. The text provides no information supporting this claim.

**So the correct answer is C.**



"
Mebutla ke phoofolo ye e tlwaelegilego ya mohuta ofe wa phoofolo yeo e jago diphoofolo?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikatse tše nnyane (Small cats)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ka fase ga tšona ke dikatse tša go lekanela tšeo dijago dilabi tša go lekanela go tloga go mebutla go ya go ditšei le kgama."" which translates to ""In essence, it's the cats that are the appropriate size for the prey that the cats are able to hunt, from hares to deer and antelope."" This indicates the cats in question are small cats.
"
Dikatse tše nnyane ka setlwaedi di tsoma ke efe ya tše di latelago?,"The correct answer is **A: Digotlane (Antelopes)**.

The passage states that small cats include many small cats, such as antelopes, bats, rodents, and shrews. Therefore, antelopes are one of the small cats mentioned in the text.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sego karolo ya mokgwa wa go tsoma wa ocelot?,"The correct answer is **D: Go ja fela diphoofolo tša seemo se se nyenyane** (Only eating small animals).

Here's why:

* **The text states ocelots eat a variety of prey:** The passage explicitly says ocelots eat ""ditšhwene, dinoga, di-rodents le dinonyana ge di kgona"" (snakes, lizards, rodents and birds when they can).
* **Options A, B, and C are all mentioned as part of their hunting strategy:**
    * **A: Go iphihla ka gare ga tikologo ya bona (Hiding within their environment):** The text says they stalk prey from hiding.
    * **B: Go latela monkgo wa phoofolo ya bona (Following the scent of their prey):** The text says they rely on their excellent night vision and hearing, implying they track prey.
    * **C: Go latela phoofolo ya bona bošego (Tracking prey by sight):** The text states they have excellent night vision.

Therefore, the statement that ocelots *only* eat small animals is incorrect according to the passage.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa hlalošego ocelot ka nepo? ,"The correct answer is **C: Sekwi sa tšona sa go dupa ga se na matla (Their tail is not strong)**.

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Di kgona go bona gabotse ge di le leswiswing ka pono ya bošego, gomme di sepela ka go nanya.""  This means they hunt by sight and pounce. This implies their tail *is* important for balance and maneuvering during a pounce, and therefore *is* strong.
* The text mentions they are stealthy and hunt small animals.
* The text explicitly states they are good at finding prey hidden underground.
* The text says they are good at climbing trees to rest.

Therefore, the statement that their tail isn't strong contradicts the information provided in the text.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ka se tšewego e le maatla a magolo a nkwe?,"The correct answer is **D: Go goga (To roar)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a lion's roar is powerful enough to travel long distances and shake a person to their core. It directly links roaring to the lion's strength and power. The other options don't carry the same implication of raw power described in the text.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše yeo e lego phapano magareng ga dinkwe le ditau?","The correct answer is **D: Maatla a go goga ga tšona** (Its roaring strength).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ya goga ka maatla a go iša ga hlano a motho"" which translates to ""roars with the strength to make a person's five senses go numb."" This highlights the power and intensity of a lion's roar, which is a key difference between lions and other big cats (like leopards, cheetahs, and jaguars).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bokgoni bja go rutha (Ability to climb):** While lions can climb, it's not a defining characteristic that distinguishes them from other big cats.
* **B: Modumo wa go rora wa tšona (Its roaring sound):** While lions *do* roar, the passage focuses on the *strength* of the roar, not just the sound itself.  Other big cats also roar, albeit with different qualities.
* **C: Bokgole bja tšona bja go hlotša (Its hunting skill):**  All big cats are skilled hunters. This isn't a differentiating factor.



Therefore, the roar's strength is the most distinct trait highlighted in the passage that sets lions apart.



"
"Go ya ka temana ye, Robert Hooke o ile a dirang pele ga ditsebi tše dingwe tša thutaphedi?","The correct answer is **B: Diriša microscope go lebelela sephedi** (Use a microscope to observe the tissue).

Here's why:

The passage states that Robert Hooke observed the cells using a microscope. It explicitly mentions he used a microscope to see the small squares within cork and discovered the ""cells.""  The other options are either things he did *because* he used a microscope, or are not directly mentioned as his initial action.
"
Naa lentšu le la sele le tšwa kae gomme le ra goreng?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikhwere tše nnyane (Small squares)**.

The passage states: ""Di lebelega bjalo ka diphaphuši."" which translates to ""They look like little squares.""  And also mentions it derives from the Latin word ""cella"" meaning ""small room"". Therefore, the best option is ""small squares"".
"
"Go ya ka temana, bontši bja diphoofolo di na le bokgoni bja go dira eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go fofa**.

The passage states: ""Diphoofolo di hwetšwa gohle lefaseng. Di epa fase, tša rutha ka mawatleng, **gomme tša fofa lefaufaung.**"" (Jellyfish are found all over the world. They swim underwater, float in the air, and **crawl on land**.)
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo diphoofolo tše dingwe di se nago tšona?","The correct answer is **C: Bjoko**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Diphoofolo di fela di nago le bjoko (le ge e le gore ga se diphoofolo kamoka; jellyfish, ka mohlala, ga e na bjoko).""  This means that most animals *do* have skeletons, but jellyfish are an exception. Therefore, the question asks what most animals *don't* have, which is a skeleton (bjoko).
"
Ke eng seo se thušago dimela ka tshepedišo ya photosynthesis?,"The correct answer is **D: Letšatši**. 

Here's why:

* **Photosynthesis** is the process where plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food (sugars) and release oxygen. 
* **Sunlight** is the energy source that drives this process. 

The other options are incorrect:

* **Moriti (Nitrogen):** While important for plant growth, it's not the primary energy source for photosynthesis.
* **Diphoofolo (Animals):** Animals benefit from plants, but they don't directly help with photosynthesis.
* **Dijo (Food):** Food is *produced* by photosynthesis, not something that *helps* with it.



"
Ke eng seo batho ba se ntšhago moya seo dibjalo di se hemago?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon dioxide**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dimela di dira oxygen yeo batho ba e hemago, gomme tšona tšea carbon-dioxide yeo batho ba e ntšago (go ra gore, yeo ba e hemelago ka ntle).""  This translates to: ""Plants make oxygen that people breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that people produce (that is, what we exhale).""

Therefore, people exhale carbon dioxide, which plants inhale.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mehlala efe yeo e latelago yeo e bego e tla šitiša tshepedišo ya tšwelelelo?","The correct answer is **B: Karolo ya baagi ba tee bao ba hudugelago tikologong e mpsha.**

Here's why:

The passage states that a small group adapting to a new environment will eventually diverge and become a separate species. Option B directly reflects this.  The passage highlights that the small group *adapts and thrives* in the new environment, which is the key step in the evolutionary process described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sehlopha se senyenyane seo se palelwago ke go atlega lefelong le lefsa:** While adaptation is part of it, the passage emphasizes the *divergence* and eventual separation into a new species. Option A doesn't capture that.
* **C: Baagi bao ba beakanyago go tlwaelana ga bona ka gare ga tikologo ye mpsha:**  This describes cooperation *within* the group, not the adaptation that leads to speciation.
* **D: Palo e tee ya baagi mafelelong e bopa tše pedi:** This simply describes the result (two species) but not the process of how that result is achieved. The passage focuses on the initial adaptation and divergence.



"
Ke efe ya dipolelo tše di latelago yeo e sa hlalošego ka nepo tshepedišo ya go hlola mehuta ya diphedi? ,"The correct answer is **A: E direga ge baagi ba bafsa ba sa kgone go tlwaelana le maemo** (It occurs when the inhabitants of a new environment are unable to adapt to the conditions).

Here's why:

The passage explains that speciation happens when a population is isolated and faces different environmental pressures.  Option A directly addresses this - the inability to adapt to a new environment is a key driver of populations diverging and ultimately becoming distinct species.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ke karolo ye bohlokwa ya tshepedišo ya tšwelelelo** (It is an important part of the theory of evolution): While speciation *is* a crucial part of evolution, option B doesn't explain *what* triggers speciation.
* **C: E bolela ka sebopego sa mohuta o mofsa wa diphedi** (It refers to the structure of a primitive type of animal):  The passage is about speciation, not about the structure of primitive animals.
* **D: Ke tiragalo yeo e sa phemegego** (It is an improbable occurrence):  The passage presents speciation as a natural and important process, not an improbable one.



"
Ke karolo efe ya tshepedišo ya go elela ga madi yeo e tlišago madi pelong?,"The correct answer is **D: Methapo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Setho se golo ga tshepedišo ya madi ke pelo, yeo e pompago madi... a tloga go tšwa ka pelong ka metapo yeo e bitšwago di arteries gomme a boela morago ka pelong ka metapo yeo e bitšwago mašika.""

This means blood *leaves* the heart through arteries and *returns* to the heart through veins.  The question asks which part *carries blood into the heart*.  Veins are the vessels that carry blood back to the heart.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Methapo** (Veins).
"
Ke diphaephe dife tšeo e lego tše dinyenyane kudu tshepedišong ya go elela ga madi?,"The correct answer is **A: Di-capillary tša mmele** (Body capillaries).

The passage states: ""Metapo ye mennyanenyane e bitšwago capillaries."" which translates to ""Very small vessels called capillaries."" 

Therefore, capillaries are the smallest blood vessels involved in the circulatory system.
"
Bokgoni bja khunkhwane bja go phutha maphego a tšona morago bo oketša ke efe ya tše di latelago?,"The correct answer is **A: Kabo ya dijo** (Food source).

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to breathe air allowed insects to eat a lot and grow a lot. This increased food intake is directly linked to the evolution of the ability to shed their exoskeletons.  A larger food source is a prerequisite for bigger growth and the need to shed the old exoskeleton.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go uta dikgoba** (Eating dung): While some insects do eat dung, it's not the primary reason for the evolution of exoskeleton shedding.
*   **C: Go hwetša balekane** (Finding mates): Mating is important for reproduction, but it doesn't directly cause the development of the exoskeleton-shedding ability.
*   **D: Lebelo la sefofane** (Length of the wing): Wing length is related to flight, not directly to exoskeleton shedding.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa bolelwago temaneng bjalo ka selo seo se amago ke bokgoni bja khunkhwane bja go fofa?,"The correct answer is **C: Go kgoboketša dijo (Storing food)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bokgone bja tšona bja go fofa bo di dirile gore di tšabela manaba a mantši gomme di hwetše dijo gabonolo ebile di kopanela gabonolo."" (Their ability to fly allowed them to eat a lot of food and find food easily and together.) This directly links the ability to fly to the ability to store and find food.
* **The other options are less directly related:**
    * **A: Go tšweletša gape (To evolve further):** While flight is a result of evolution, the passage focuses on the *consequence* of flight - efficient food gathering.
    * **B: Nako ya bophelo (Lifespan):** The passage doesn't discuss lifespan.
    * **D: Bokgoni (Ability):** This is too general. The question asks what *specifically* is linked to the flying ability.



Therefore, **go kgoboketša dijo (storing food)** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.



"
Ke efe ya dimelo tše di latelago yeo e sa tswalanego ka tlwaelo le di-dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **A: Go sepela ka leoto la ka morago (To walk on two legs)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that birds share many characteristics with dinosaurs, including having two-legged locomotion (walking on two legs), long tails, and beaks.
* While dinosaurs *could* have feathers (some did), it's not a universal characteristic of all dinosaurs.
* Both birds and some dinosaurs ate meat (carnivorous).
* Both birds and some dinosaurs had scales.

Therefore, the most surprising similarity is the ability to walk on two legs.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo ka setlwaedi e sa tšewego bjalo ka seka se se abelenago dinonyana le dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **A: Go beela mae (To lay eggs)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that one of the key similarities between dinosaurs and birds is that they *both lay eggs*.
* While both dinosaurs and birds have legs, feathers, and the ability to roar (in some cases), these are not as fundamental a shared characteristic as egg-laying.
* The ability to roar is specific to certain dinosaurs (like T-Rex) and birds.
* Having legs and feathers are also shared characteristics, but egg-laying is a more fundamental biological trait.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer as it points to a core shared trait."
"Go ya ka temana, ke karolo efe ya sebjalo sa cycad seo go nago le kgonagalo ya gore Triceraptops e je?","The correct answer is **A: Makala a spiky (Spiky scales)**.

The text states: ""Dimela tše di lebelelega bjalo ka mohlare o monnyane wa mo palm ka ntlhora ya mphaphahlogo, le matlakala a go phadimela."" This translates to: ""These plants are similar to a small palm tree with prickly scales."" Triceratops ate these plants, specifically the prickly scales.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo go nago le kgonagalo e kgolo ya gore Triceratops e je? ","The correct answer is **B: Semela sa goba le matlakala thata**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, which are described as ""plants that are like a small palm with tough leaves.""
* The passage further mentions that the Triceratops might have used its beak to strip the tough leaves off the cycads. 
* The passage also says that cycads are considered toxic to mammals, but other animals (sloths, parrots) have adapted to eat them.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is that the Triceratops likely ate plants with tough leaves - cycads.  The other options are either not mentioned in the text as a food source for Triceratops (sloth, parrot) or are too general (plants with toxic leaves).
"
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke dipapadi dife tšeo di latelago tšeo go bonagalago di tla ratwa kudu dileteng tše dintši tva ka leboa la Italy?","The correct answer is **A: Kgwele ya maoto (Football)**.

Here's why:

The text states that football is the most popular sport in Italy and that Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympic Games. While other sports are mentioned as popular in general, football is specifically highlighted as the *most* popular in Italy. The other options are mentioned but not given the same level of emphasis.
"
"Go ya tshedimošo yeo e filwego temaneng,ke dipapadi dife go tše di latelago tšeo di thopilego sefoka sa lefase sa Italy?","The correct answer is **A: Kgwele ya maoto (Football)**.

The text states: ""Sehlopa sa kgweleamaoto sa naga ya Italy...ke sehlopa sa bobedi sa go atlega lefaseng..."" which translates to ""The Italian football team...is the second most successful team in the world..."" This indicates that football (kgwele ya maoto) is the most popular sport in Italy.
"
Ka morago ga tiragalo efe moo dikarolo tše itšego tša Luxembourg di ilego tša fetoga tva Belgian?,"The correct answer is **B: Phetogo ya Belgian**.

The text states: ""Dikarolo tša lehono tša Belgium e be e le karolo ya Luxembourg kgale efela ya ba Belgian ka morago ga Mpherefere wa Belgian wa di 1830.""  This directly indicates that the change occurred during the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ilego ya kgoma go se tšee lehlakore ga Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **C: Phetogo ya Belgian**.

The passage states: ""Dikarolo tša lehono tša Belgium e be e le karolo ya Luxembourg kgale efela ya ba Belgian ka morago ga Mpherefere wa Belgian wa di 1830."" (Parts of Luxembourg were only recently part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.)

Therefore, the Belgian Revolution is the event that caused Luxembourg to cease being a completely independent entity.
"
Ke dikhilomithara tše kae tša sekwere tva palomoka ya lefelo la Turkey tšeo di lego Yuropa?,"The correct answer is **A: 9174**.

The passage states: ""...bobedi bja dikilomitara tše 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) di Yuropa.""  This means 9,174 square miles (which is the same as 9174 square kilometers) of Turkey are located in Europe.
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo, Turkey e ka ba dikhilomithara tše kae ka botelele?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Turkey ya Turkey e feta dikilomitara tše 1,600 (1,000 mi) ka bo telele..."" which translates to ""Turkey's Turkey exceeds 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) in length..."".
"
Leleme la se-Latin le šomišetšwang motseng wa Vatican?,"The correct answer is **C: Molao** (Law).

The text states: ""Motse wa Vatican o šomiša se-Italian ka gare ga legotlatheramelao le dipoledišano semmušo tša bona. Se-Italian gape ke polelo ya letšatši ka letšatši yeo e šomišwago ke bontši bja bao ba šomago mmušong mola se-Latin gantši se šomišwa meketeng ya sedumedi. Badudi ka moka ba Vatican ke ma-Roman Catholic.""

And later: ""...me ketlelela go tšeletša meletlo ya bodumedi le go šomišwa se-Latin."" This indicates that Latin is used in official law and ceremonies within the Vatican City.  While it's also used in official documents and occasionally in media, its primary role is in law.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate.
"
"Motseng Vatican, ke eng seo se Italian se sa dirišetšwago sona?","The correct answer is **A: Molao (Law)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Italian is used in Vatican City for **official laws and documents** (legotlatheramelao le dipoledišano semmušo).  Therefore, law is something Italian *is* used for, not something it *isn't* used for.

The other options are all things that Italian *is* used for in Vatican City:

*   **B: Kgokagano ya semmušo (Official communication)** - The text says Italian is used in official communication.
*   **C: Meletlo ya bodumedi (Diplomatic practice)** - The text mentions Italian is often used in diplomatic settings.
*   **D: Poledišano ya letšatši ka letšatši (Daily conversation)** - The text states Italian is the daily language used by many people working in the Vatican.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e kgolago ke go tswaka medumo go dikhomphutara tše di raraganego?","The correct answer is **A: Mmino (Music)**.

The text states: ""Mmino o gatišwa gantši go šomišwa dikhomphuthara tša go hlakahlakantšha go sepediša le go hlakanya medumo mmogo."" This translates to: ""Music is often used in computer editing to speed up and analyze popularity together."" 

Therefore, music is the answer.
"
"Go ya ka temana ye, bontši bja magae ao lefelong lefe ao a bego a ena le dintlwana tša boithomelo tšeo di hlatswago?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Metse ya Harappa le Mohenjo-daro e be e na le ntlwana ya boithomelo ya go folaša ka gare ga motseng o mongwe le o mongwe..."" (The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a drainage system within each city...).

While the passage mentions other places with drainage systems, it specifically names Mohenjo-daro as one of them. The question asks which option *bontši* (many) of the listed places had such systems. 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate based *solely* on the passage:

*   **B: Persia:** The passage mentions Persia as having drainage systems, but doesn't highlight it as a primary example like Mohenjo-daro.
*   **C: Santorini:** The passage mentions Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini having drainage systems, but only in the context of the discovery of drainage systems, not that Santorini was a widespread place with drainage systems.
*   **D: China:** The passage mentions China as having drainage systems in ancient times, but again, it's not a primary example like Mohenjo-daro.

Therefore, Mohenjo-daro is the most directly and strongly supported answer based *only* on the information provided in the passage.
"
Ke mafelong a mafe a a latelago ao go ilego gwa hwetšwa ditshepedišo tše di tšwetšego pele tša go ntšha ditšhila?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The passage states: ""Metse ya Harappa le Mohenjo-daro e be e na le ntlwana ya boithomelo ya go folaša ka gare ga motseng o mongwe le o mongwe..."" which directly indicates that early evidence of sanitation systems was found in Harappa.

Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e dirago gore mo-skater a retologo?,"The correct answer is **A: Go kobega ga nyenyane ka tlase ga legare la skate** (The small gap underneath the skate).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: *""Se se dira gore skater se retologe. Ge eba di skate di ka šutela ka letsogong la go ja, skater se sokologela ka letsogong la go ja, ge di skate di ka šutela ka letsogong la ngele, skater se sokologela ka letsogong la ngele.""*  (What makes the skater balance. When the skates can slide to the left, the skater leans to the left, when the skates can slide to the right, the skater leans to the right.)

The passage also explains that this balancing act is because *""ge legare bo kobegile ga nnyane, bjale ka ge legare le eya ka lehlakoreng le tee goba le lengwe, mafelelo ao a kgomanego le aese le wo a kobega. Se se dira gore skater se retologe.""* (because the gap underneath the skate is small, but when the skate goes to one side or the other, the combined force and that gap become bigger. This makes the skater balance.)

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:

*   **B: Bo mathoko go go bedi ka lehlakoreng la legare la skate** (The gap is small on the side of the skate) - While the gap's size is relevant, the *smallness* of the gap is what's key.
*   **C: Boemo bja bokgoni ka moka bja skate** (The overall skill level of the skate) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Boleng bja ice** (The quality of the ice) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.

"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e hlalošago ka mo go nepagetšego sekoti seo se lego legare la ice skate ya mehleng ya bjale?","The correct answer is **A: E na le mapheko a mabedi** (It has two blades).

The text explicitly states: ""Mathoko a a mabedi a dumelela bakeng sa go kgomarela aese ka tsela ye kaone..."" which translates to ""Two blades allow for the skater to balance properly...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E kobegile** (It is flexible) - The text says the blade is *not* flexible, it's rigid (""bofase bja legare bo kobegile ga nnyane"" - the surface of the blade is not very flexible).
* **C: Se se tshekamego** (It is sharp) - While blades *are* sharp, the text doesn't focus on the sharpness.  The focus is on the two blades allowing for balance.
* **D: E sekame** (It is curved) - The text does not mention curvature.

"Go ya ka temana, ke tshepedišo efe yeo e dumelelago di atom go fediša maatla a feteletšego seetšeng?","The correct answer is **A: Mahlasedi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Borasaentsheba betša tshepeditšo ye """"""""phatlalatšo yeo e tutueditšwego ya mahlasedi"""""""" ka lebaka la gore di atoms di tutueditšwe ke seetša sa go phadima...""  This directly translates to ""Scientists believe in the """"""""coherent emission of photons"""""""" because atoms are excited by incident light...""

Therefore, the text explicitly identifies ""coherent emission of photons"" (which is related to the behavior of light/photons) as the theory that allows atoms to release energy as light.  While photons are involved, the *theory* is about the light emission itself.
"
Ke eng seo se se dirago gore atom e ntšhe photon?,"The correct answer is **B: Tlhohleletšo ye e hlolwago ke seetša se se phadimago (Quantum phenomenon)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explains that atoms emit photons due to a quantum phenomenon called ""spontaneous emission."" This phenomenon occurs because atoms are affected by the electromagnetic radiation (light) around them.  The text emphasizes that atoms are ""tutueditšwe ke seetša sa go phadima"" (influenced by the radiating light), which is key to understanding spontaneous emission. Option B directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go lokolla maatla ao a feletšego (Releasing excess energy):** While atoms *can* release energy, it's not the primary reason for spontaneous photon emission. Atoms can release energy in other ways (e.g., when electrons change energy levels), but spontaneous emission is distinct.
* **C: Boemo bja maatla bjo bo sa tiago (Unstable energy state):**  Atoms can be in unstable energy states, but that doesn't directly *cause* photon emission.  The interaction with the electromagnetic field is the crucial factor.
* **D: Karabelo ye mpe go mahlasedi (Bad response to radiation):** This is a nonsensical option and doesn't relate to the scientific explanation provided.

"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se tlago feleletša se dira gore tleloupu ya lebone e kgaotše go šoma?","The correct answer is **D: Tshepedišo ya mohlagase ka gare ga sokete e a fokotšega.**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Se ke ka lebaka la gore mohlagase wa go elela go ya ka gare ga sokete moo karolo ya tšhipi ya lebone e dulago go ka fa lešhoko la mohlagase le šoro ge o ka kgoma ka gare ga sokete goba motheo wa tšhipi wa lebone mola e sale gannyane ka gare ga sokete.""  This translates to: ""It can be because the power supply goes into the socket where the chip part of the light goes and the power cable gets frayed or the core of the light chip is small inside the socket."" This indicates that a weak or interrupted power supply in the socket is a common reason for a light to fail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sedirišwa sa lebone se sa tingwa gabotse (The light bulb is not screwed in properly):** While a loose bulb *can* cause issues, the text focuses on problems *within* the socket and power supply, not just the bulb itself.
* **B: Go ba le lebone la motheo wa tšhipi feela go karolo ya ka soketeng (Only the core of the chip is in the socket part):** This is a very specific and unlikely scenario. The text doesn't suggest this.
* **C: Dithapo ka gare ga lebone le a tuka (The wires inside the light are frayed):** Frayed wires *could* be a cause, but the text specifically emphasizes the power supply issue in the socket.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer, directly supported by the text's focus on power supply problems in the socket.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ka bago kotsi go e kgoma ge o tšeela lebone legato,"The correct answer is **A: Dithapo tša kaa gare ga lebone (Wires inside the phone)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that before opening the phone, the power source (wires) needs to be disconnected.  Touching these wires while disassembling the phone poses a significant risk of electric shock.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Go rumušwa ga lebone (Phone cracking):** While possible, cracking isn't the immediate, primary danger.
* **C: Motheo wa lebone (Phone core/chip):**  While damaging the core could render the phone useless, the immediate risk is the electrical components.
* **D: Thapo (Cable/Cord):**  The passage specifically mentions the wires *inside* the phone as being the danger. While a cable *connected* to the phone could also be a hazard, the internal wires are the most critical concern.



Therefore, touching the wires inside the phone is the most immediate and serious danger when disassembling it."
"Go ya temana, go direga eng ge nucleus e arogane?","The correct answer is **C: Di atom di thoma go se be gabotse**.

Here's why:

* **Nuclear fission** is the process where a heavy nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei.  This splitting releases a tremendous amount of energy.
* **The key outcome of fission is that the original heavy nucleus breaks apart into lighter nuclei.** This is what causes the atoms to become unstable or radioactive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Diprothone di a hwetšwa (Protons are found):** While protons *are* present in the resulting nuclei, the splitting process doesn't simply *find* protons; the entire nucleus breaks apart.
* **B: Enetši e lokolotšwe (Energy is released):** This is true, but it doesn't describe what *happens to the atoms* themselves. The released energy is a *consequence* of the atoms becoming unstable.
* **D: Di-neutron di a lahlega (Neutrons are separated):** Neutrons are also released during fission, but the primary outcome for the atoms is that they become unstable, not necessarily just having neutrons separated.



Therefore, the most accurate and direct consequence of nuclear fission, as described in the text, is that the atoms become unstable.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e bontšhago dipitšo tša bokgole bjo botelele morago fase lefaseng,"The correct answer is **A: Di-telescope**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Borathuthamahlale ba šomiša di telescope lefaufaung..."" (Scientists use telescopes in space...)
* **Telescopes are designed to observe distant objects.** The passage mentions the Earth's atmosphere interferes with our vision, so telescopes are needed *in space* to overcome that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sathalaete (Satellites):** Satellites are often used for communication, weather monitoring, etc., but they don't *observe* distant objects themselves.  The passage mentions a satellite, but the question is about what *shows* us distant images.
* **C: Mabone (Eyes):** Our eyes are not used for observing things in space; telescopes are.
* **D: Di-rokete (Rockets):** Rockets are used to transport things *to* space, but they don't observe anything.



"
Ke efe ya tšeo di dirišetšwago go bea telescope lefaufaung?,"The correct answer is **B: Di-rokete (Rockets)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sathalaete e rometšwe lefaufaung ka rokhete."" (The satellite was sent to space by a rocket.)
* **It also says:** ""Go tšea rokete e kgolokgolo ya bogolo bja go feta maoto a 100 ka go ya godimo go bea satalaete goba teleskopo lefaufaung."" (A large, round rocket was used to place the satellite or telescope in space, going over 100 miles high.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mahlasedi a lebone (Solar panels):** While satellites *use* solar panels for power, they aren't used to *place* them in space.
* **C: Lefaufau la lefase (Earth's gravity):** Earth's gravity is what the rockets *overcome* to get to space, but it's not a tool used for placing things there.
* **D: Disathalaete tša godimo ga dimithara tše 100 tša godimo (Satellites above 100 miles):** Satellites are the *result* of using rockets to get things into space, not the tool used for the process.



"
Ke fe yeo e swanetšego go lemogwa ka ga tiragalo ya modikologo e le gore go nyakišišwa go feta ga nako?,"The correct answer is **B: Poeletšo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""O ka maraka go feta ga nako ka bo wena ka go lebelela **poeletša ya tiragalo**.""  This translates to ""You can perceive the passing of time by observing the **pattern of events**.""

While ""Nako"" (time) is mentioned, the text emphasizes *how* we perceive time – through the patterns of events. ""Poeletšo"" (pattern/trend/progression) is the direct answer to the question of *where* we can observe the passing of time.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nako** (Time): While time is the underlying concept, it's not the place where we *observe* the passing of time.
*   **C: Go amega** (Changes/Movement): While changes happen over time, the text focuses on the *pattern* of changes.
*   **D: Bothata** (Problems): Problems are not directly related to perceiving the passage of time.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""gomme ka morago Histori, a hwetša 2:2 (kgrata ya fase ya bobedi)."" This means he obtained a 2:2 degree. The question asks what is *typical* for a prince to achieve. While going to university (B) and studying history (C) are things Charles did, the passage highlights the specific degree he earned (2:2) as a key detail about his academic achievement.  Option D is incorrect because the passage states he went to university *after* school.  Therefore, achieving a degree (specifically a 2:2 in this case) is the most directly stated and thus most typical outcome described.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimošo yeo e filwego temaneng,Charles e bile wa mathomo go dira eng?","The correct answer is **C: Hwetša lengwalo la thuto**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""gomme ka morago Histori, a hwetša 2:2 (kgrata ya fase ya bobedi)."" This means Charles obtained a degree in History. Option C directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tsenela sešole pele a fetša sekolo:** The passage says he went to university *after* school, so this is wrong.
*   **B: Ithute Boepi bja Marapo:** While he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, the passage emphasizes his degree in History. This isn't the primary achievement mentioned.
*   **D: Tsena kholetšheng ya Trinity:** While he attended Trinity College, Cambridge, the question asks what he *did* - he obtained a degree."
Ke nageng efe ya sehlopha sa dikepe sa Trygvasson se tšwa kae?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The passage states: ""...Made raids by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian warlord who went on campaigns in pursuit of his kingdom after the Danish rule."" This directly indicates that Trygvasson was Norwegian.
"
Ke nakong efe historing yeo Germany e ilego ya ba le tutuetšo ye maatla ya setšo go Estonia?,"The answer is **C: Mengwaga ye e ka bago ye 600 ye e fetilego**.

The passage states: ""Ka bo ngwagakgolo wa bo 15, leboa la Estonia le be le le ka fase ga kgathelelo ye kgolo ya Germany."" (In the year 15, Estonia was under the control of Germany.)  The subsequent details describe the influence of German on the Estonian language over time. The time period described, starting in 15 and evolving significantly over time, points towards a timeframe of around 600 years (from around the 15th century to the present day). While the text doesn't give a precise date range for the language influence, 600 years is the most reasonable estimate based on the information provided.
"

The text explicitly states: ""Tekano yeo e naganelwago go tloga go diboledi tše dimilione tše 340 go ya go dimilione tše 500, le bontši bja batho ba go ka lekana dimilione tše 800 ba ka kwešiša polelo."" (The estimated range goes from 340 million speakers to 500 million, and roughly 800 million people can understand the language.)

This indicates that the estimate of Hindi speakers is based on the number of people who *understand* the language, not just those who speak it.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ge le gore dipolelo-semmotwana tšeo di swanago kudu le Se-Hindi di a balwa:** While related languages might influence the total, the text doesn't say this is the primary factor in the variation.
* **B: Ge e ba baboledi ba Se-Urdu ba a balwa:** Urdu speakers are mentioned in relation to Hindi (being mutually intelligible), but they aren't the basis for estimating the number of Hindi speakers.
* **D: Ge batho bao ba kgonago go bala polelo ba a balwa:**  The text focuses on *understanding* the language, not just the ability to read it.  While reading comprehension is related, it's not the main metric used for the estimates.

(Hindi and Urdu are the same in speech, only differing in writing; in both languages, the two dialects often have mutual intelligibility.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di fapana ka mongwalo** (They differ in writing) - While true, this is only *one* difference mentioned, not the core relationship.
* **C: Di a swana ka bobedi ka tlotlontšu le mongwalo** (They are the same in both pronunciation and writing) - Incorrect. The passage states they differ in writing.
* **D: Di fapana ka tlotlontšu** (They differ in pronunciation) - While there are pronunciation differences, the passage emphasizes *mutual intelligibility*, implying significant similarity.

*   Option A is correct.
*   Option C is correct.
*   Option D is incorrect. The text does not state that it was created over time. It was created in 1444.



Therefore, option B is the incorrect statement regarding the history of Hangeul."

"Go ya ka temana, ke polelo efe yeo e tutueditšwego ke Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **B: Maleme a Europe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sanskrit ke leleme la kgalekgale gomme le bapetšega le leleme la se-Latin la go bolelwa Yuropa.""  This translates to: ""Sanskrit is a highly influential language and is related to the Latin language spoken in Europe.""  Therefore, Sanskrit influenced many European languages.
"
"Go ya ka temana, tšhomišo ya Sanskrit e ile ya fokotšwa go fihla go eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go raragana (Declining)**.

The passage states: ""Sanskrit ke polelo ya go hlakhlakana ya go topela, yeo e hlanketšego goba mothopo bakeng sa maleme a mantši a sebjalebjale a India, bjalo ka ge se-Latin e le mothopo bakeng sa maleme a mantši a Yuropa go tswana le se-French le se-Spanish."" This implies that Sanskrit, like Latin, gradually declined in usage as other languages developed.

The passage also mentions the rise of other languages and the decline of Sanskrit's prominence.  ""Sanskrit ke leleme la kgalekgale gomme le bapetšega le leleme la se-Latin la go bolelwa Yuropa. Puku ya go ngwalwa pelepele lefaseng yeo e tsebegago e ngwadilwe ka se-Sanskrit. Ka morago ga kgoboketšo ya Upanishads, se-Sanskrit se ile sa hwelela ka baka la lenaneo la go ya godimo."" This suggests a shift and a gradual decline in Sanskrit's central position.

Therefore, the best option reflecting this decline is **Go raragana (Declining)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ge o ka ema bogodimong bja lo, o ka kala bonnyane go feta lefaseng."" (When you stand in space, you would weigh less than on Earth.)  The following sentences illustrate this: a person weighing 200 pounds on Earth weighs only 36 pounds in space, and a butterfly (which is lighter than a person) would weigh *even less*.

The core idea is that weight is dependent on gravity. You weigh less when you're in a weaker gravitational field. Therefore, a butterfly would weigh less than you in space, and the Earth's gravity is stronger than the gravity in space. So, the butterfly would be pulled *down* towards the Earth, meaning it would experience a force pulling it *down* that is weaker than the force pulling you down.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maatlakgogedi a lo a goga go feta, ke lebaka leo o bego o tla ka boima bjo bonyenyane** (Butterflies weigh more, which is why you would weigh less): This is the opposite of what the passage says.
*   **C: Maatlakgogedi a lo a goga kudu, ke ka baka leo o bego o tla boima bjo bo oketšegilego** (Butterflies weigh a lot, which is why you would weigh more): This is incorrect.
*   **D: Maatlakgogedi a lo a goga kudu, maatlakgogedi a lefase a be a tla goga kudu go feta maatlakgogedi a lo** (Butterflies weigh a lot, and Earth butterflies would weigh more than yours): This is incorrect because Earth's gravity is stronger, meaning Earth butterflies would be pulled down more.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The moon's beautiful markings (legogo) are visible as dark areas (legogo). These dark areas are roughly 70 km wide on the near side and 100 km wide on the far side.
* **The passage also says:** The moon is often seen near the horizon and near the constellations.
* **The passage connects dark areas with the possibility of maria:**  It says there might be maria both on the near and far sides due to the size of the dark areas.
* **The mountains' effect:** The passage mentions that it's a good place for observing the moon rising above the mountains.
* **Reasoning:** Since maria are dark areas, and the mountains are rising, the maria would likely be *below* the rising mountains.  Option D directly reflects this logical inference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ya ka temana, ke kae moo legogo la Ngwedi le lego le le koto kudu? (According to the text, where is the moon's dark area the widest?)**  While the text mentions the widest dark areas, the question asks what *might* be visible *after* the moon is visible *outside* of it. This option is too specific about the widest area.
* **B: Kgapetla ye sesane ka tlase ga dinaga tše di phagamego (Extend this downwards from the rising mountains)** This is not necessarily true; the maria don't *have* to extend downwards.
* **C: Go ka ba le Maria yo monyenyane ka lehlakoreng le le lego kgole (There might be small maria on the far side)** The passage mentions maria on *both* sides, but doesn't specifically pinpoint the far side.  Option D is more accurate given the context.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae moo legogo la Ngwedi le lego le le koto kudu?","The correct answer is **A: Ka lehlakoreng la kgauswi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Legogo le ka ba ka bokotwana bja 70 km ka lehlakoreng la kgauswi gomme ka bokotwana bja 100 km ka lehlakoreng la kgojana."" This translates to: ""The crater can be 70 km wide on the northern side and 100 km wide on the southern side."" Therefore, the crater is widest on the northern side (lehlakoreng la kgauswi).

Here's why:

* The passage discusses the possibility of extraterrestrial life (""di-alien"") and the belief that life might exist on other planets. 
* It mentions the vastness of the universe and the potential for life to evolve elsewhere.
* The other options are either not directly supported by the text or are less central to the main point:
    * **A: Batho ba sepetše go dinaledi tše dingwe** (Humans have met aliens): The passage doesn't say humans have met aliens; it talks about the *possibility*.
    * **B: Batho ga ba kgone go hlahloba mantšu a mangwe** (Humans cannot explore other worlds):  This is a statement about current limitations, not a belief held by many.
    * **D: Go na le dikhilomitara tša ka tlase ga ditrillione magareng ga dinaledi** (There are kilometers of trillions between stars): This is a detail about the scale of the universe, not the core belief discussed.

Ke efe ya dilo tše di latelago tšeo di hlokometšwego yeo e thušitšego go tlišetša kgopolo ya Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Kgato ya Venus (Observation of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **Galileo's observations of Venus** were crucial. He saw phases of Venus, just like the Moon. This was impossible to explain with the geocentric (Earth-centered) model of the universe. It strongly supported Copernicus's heliocentric (Sun-centered) model.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Tshepedišo ya Venus (Prediction of Venus):** While predicting Venus's phases was important, the observation itself was the key piece of evidence.
* **C: Go swana ga Letšatši le Venus (Similarity of the Sun and Venus):** While related, the *phases* of Venus were the direct observation that challenged the geocentric model.  It wasn't about the Sun and Venus being similar.
* **D: Go swana ga letšatši le ngwedi (Similarity of the Sun and the Moon):**  While Venus *does* have phases like the Moon, the key was the *similarity* of Venus's phases to the Moon, which was already understood. Galileo's finding that Venus had phases *like the Moon* provided a strong link to the heliocentric model.



Therefore, **A: Kgato ya Venus** is the most accurate answer."
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo ilego ya bonwa ke Galileo Galilei ka 1610?,"The correct answer is **A: Lehlakore la ngwedi le lebeletšego letšatši (The crescent-shaped phase)**.

Mamanoga a direga ka le baka la gore fela lehlakore la Venus (goba la Ngwedi) la go lebana le Letšatši le laetilwe."" (Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus had phases, just like the moon. These phases occurred because only a crescent-shaped portion of Venus was illuminated as it orbited the Sun.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kgato ya Venus (Venus's orbit):** While Galileo's observations helped support the heliocentric model (the idea that planets orbit the sun), the passage doesn't mention observing the entire orbit.
* **C: Polanete e dikologa letšatši (Planets orbit the sun):** This is the theory that *supported* by Galileo's observations, but not what he *directly observed*.
* **D: Tshepedišo ya Venus (Venus's theory):**  This isn't a theory that Galileo observed directly, but rather a theory (the Copernican model) that his observations helped to prove.

Ke theto efe yeo e sa bolelwago gore e bakilwe ke Noka ya Amazon?,"The correct answer is **C: Ke noka ye telele kudu** (It is the longest river).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Amazon is the **second longest** river in the world.  Option A is correct based on this.
* The passage also states it's a **large** river. Option B is correct based on this.
* The passage describes it as a river that **flows a great distance**. Option D is correct based on this.
* However, it **doesn't say** it's the *longest* river in the world; it only says it's the second longest.

Therefore, the statement that *cannot* be confirmed by the text is that it is the longest river."
Ke mothaladi ofe wa mošomo wo o boletšwego temaneng wo o thwalago palo e nyenyane ya ma-Venezuela?,"The correct answer is **A: Temo (Manufacturing)**.

The text states: ""go fihla kotara bo šoma ka intasetereng gomme bohlano bo šoma ka go tša temo"" which translates to ""almost a quarter works in the industry and five work in manufacturing."" This indicates that the manufacturing sector employs a relatively small number of Venezuelans compared to those working in the oil industry or in informal labor.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mafapha afe go a a latelago ao a thwalago palo ye kgolo kudu ya ma-Venezuela?","The correct answer is **C: Intasteri (Industry)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bobedi bja boraro bja ma-venezuela bao ba šomago ba dira bjalo ka legorong la tirelo, go fihla kotara bo šoma ka intasetereng..."". This translates to ""Two-thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the informal sector, up to a quarter work in the industry..."".  The text also highlights the importance of the oil industry, but specifies that only a small percentage of workers are employed *within* that industry.

Therefore, the industry sector employs the largest portion of Venezuelan workers mentioned in the text, even though a large percentage is in the informal sector.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo fusion e dumelelago dinaledi go dira?","The correct answer is **C: Ntšha lesedi le phišo (Creates light and energy)**.

Here's why:

* **Fusion** is the process where light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus. This process releases an enormous amount of energy, which is why it's a potential power source.  The question states that fusion is the process that releases energy when hydrogen atoms combine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go bopa dielemente tše boima (Creates heavier elements):** While fusion *does* create heavier elements, the primary outcome we're interested in for energy generation is the energy released during the process.
* **B: Go aga di-reactor tša go kopanywa (Build fusion reactors):**  Building fusion reactors is a *challenge* (as mentioned in the passage), but fusion itself *creates* light and energy. It's a process, not just the equipment.
* **D: Bopa di atom tša hydrogen (Build hydrogen atoms):** Fusion combines hydrogen atoms; it doesn't build them.
"
Ke fe ya tše di latelago yeo reacor ya go kopanya e nago le mohola wo e ka o hlolago?,"The correct answer is **C: Di-atom**.

Here's why:

The question states that hydrogen atoms *combine* to form elements, releasing energy.  Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter, and hydrogen is an element made of atoms.  The process of combining atoms is key to understanding how energy is released. The other options are too broad:

*   **A: Hydrogen** is a specific element, not the fundamental unit of combination.
*   **B: Dinaledi** translates to ""elements"" in Sesotho. While correct in context, it doesn't pinpoint the basic units.
*   **D: Enetši** means ""energy"" in Sesotho, which is the *result* of the process, not the component being combined.

Therefore, understanding the interaction of individual **atoms** (specifically hydrogen atoms in this case) is crucial for understanding the energy release."
Sebopego sa dikhemikhale tša meetse ke eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Di-atom tše pedi ya hydrogen le atom e tee ya oksitšene**

The passage explicitly states: ""Meetse a go ya godimo a dirilwe ka di hydrogen atoms tše pedi le oxygen atom ye tee.""  This translates to ""Water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""
"
Ge meetse a fetoga dibopego ke eng seo se tlago go dula se le bjalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Sebopego sa molecular (Molecular structure)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""It has the same molecular arrangement, regardless of whether it is a gas, liquid, or solid."" This directly refers to the molecular structure remaining constant despite changes in state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tlala (Evaporation)**: Evaporation is a *process* of changing state, not the reason why the chemical structure remains the same.
* **C: Boemo bja mmele (Physical state)**: While the physical state (solid, liquid, gas) changes, the underlying molecular structure doesn't.
* **D: Seela sa nitrogen (Nitrogen's properties)**: The passage contrasts water with nitrogen, highlighting that nitrogen *does* change properties when it changes state, unlike water.



"
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e bego e se taba ya dinaga tše lesometharo ge di be di leka go gapeletša melao ye itšego?","The correct answer is **B: Go hloka maatla ka gare ga lekgotla (Lack of power within the assembly)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lekgotla le hlokile maatla a go thibela metšhelo...e ithekgile ka bolaodi bja naga, bjoo bo bego sa tšee karolo gantši, go gatelela melawana ya bjona kamoka.""

This translates to: ""The assembly lacked the power to prevent outcomes...it depended heavily on the national government, which was rarely involved, to block its laws completely.""

Therefore, the core problem preventing the assembly from effectively enacting its own laws was its lack of power *within* the assembly itself, particularly in relation to the national government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhokomelo ye boima go tšwa go balaodi ba mmušo (Difficult importance coming from the government):** While the government's lack of involvement was a factor, the passage specifically highlights the assembly's internal lack of power.
*   **C: Diphetošo tšeo di nyakago tumelelo ya go dumelelana (Changes requiring approval):** The passage mentions that changes to tax laws and budgets required approval from the government, but this is a consequence of the power imbalance, not the primary problem.
*   **D: Khuduthamaga ya setšhaba yeo e sego gona (Lack of public unrest):** The passage doesn't mention public unrest as a factor. The problem was internal to the assembly's structure and power dynamics.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke polelo efe yeo e bontšhago ka mo go nepagetšego go boemo bja mmušo wa bogareng nakong ya Ntwa ya Phetogelo?","The correct answer is **B: Diphetošo tša di hlogo di be di thekgilwe ka maatla a taolo ya lekgotla.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lekgotla le hlokile maatla a go thibela metšhelo...go gatelela melawana ya bjona kamoka."" This indicates that the authority of the council (Lekgotla) was heavily relied upon to prevent changes and even block laws.  This directly translates to changes being based on the power of the council.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Metšhelo e ile ya gapeletšwa ke lekgotla le balaodi ba mmušo:** While the council and elders did prevent changes, the passage emphasizes the *power* they wielded, not just the fact that changes were prevented.
* **C: Baemedi ba mmušo ba be ba hloka go ba gona:** The passage mentions where people lived, but it doesn't state that they were *needed*.
* **D: Mmušo wa bogareng o be o na le dikarolo tše pedi tše kgolo:** The passage mentions the council and elders, but it doesn't describe them as the *only* two major parts of the government.

Therefore, option B best reflects the core idea of the passage regarding the power dynamics of the government during the reign of Phetogelo.
"
Mantšu ao a lego ka morago ga kgoeletšo ya Tokologo a ngwadilwe bjang?,"The correct answer is **C: Godimo le fase**.

The passage states: ""...tokumente ye kgolo ya materiale wa go ngwala wa go dirwa ka matlalo a diphoofolo (e lekanya diinntšhi tša 29¾ ka diintšhi tše 24½) o thometšwe go bolokwa. Kafao, go a kgonega gore kakanyo e okeditšwe bjalo ka **leibolo**."" ( ""...the large writing material made of animal skins (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was preserved. However, it is possible that the plan was written **above and below** the label."")

Therefore, the text was written both above and below the label.
"
Singapore e tumile ka eng ya tše di latelago?,"The correct answer is **B: Go haeka (Gardening)**.

The passage states that the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped transform a piece of land into a tropical oasis. The Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid being named the national flower further emphasizes Singapore's connection to gardening and horticulture.
"
Vanda Mohumagatšana Joaquim ke eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Serapa sa dimela (Flower)**.

The text states: ""Ka 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, **lelomo la go tswakana**, le kgethilwe bjalo ka lelomo la naga.""  ""Lelomo la go tswakana"" translates to ""a flower of exploration"" or simply ""a flower.""  The text also mentions it was chosen as a national flower.
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke seka sefe sa diphiramiti tša Giza seo go bego go sa bonagale se tla makatšwa ke ba-Egipita ba Mmušo o Mofsa?","The correct answer is **B: Tšhomišo ya leswika (The angle of inclination)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ascent of the pyramids of Giza was a marvel of engineering and that the angle of inclination was difficult to achieve. The Egyptians of the Old Kingdom built impressive monuments, but the specific angle of the pyramids' slopes was something that likely challenged their engineering capabilities and would have been noteworthy.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Mengwaga ya bona (Their age):** The passage mentions the pyramids being old, but it's not the key point of difficulty they couldn't overcome.
*   **C: Bogolo bja bona (Their size):** While the size was impressive, the passage focuses on the *method* of construction, implying the angle was the main challenge.
*   **D: Kago ya bona (Their placement):** The placement is relevant, but the passage focuses on the construction process and the angle.

Therefore, the angle of inclination is the most logical answer based on the provided text."
"Go ya ka temana ye, diphoofolo tše di latelago tše di jago dimela di tloga kae di phegelela dipula?","The correct answer is **B: Meboto ya tša leboa**.

The passage states: ""Go tšwa mebotong ya leboa bakeng sa pula."" which translates to ""It comes from the northern regions for the rains.""
"
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke lefelo lefe leo diphoofolo tša go ja dimela fela di tlogago go lona dinakonyaneng tša bo Aporele?","The correct answer is **B: Leganateng la borwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that millions of grazing animals migrate to the plains (leganateng la borwa) in October to find food, and then return north after the rains in April. This indicates that the plains are the location where these grazing animals are found during the April period.
"
Operation Sealion e be e le tlhaselo ya naga efe?,"The correct answer is **A: Germany**.

The text states: ""Germany e theeile hlaselo """"""Operation sealion"""""""".  This directly translates to ""Germany initiated the operation """"Operation Sealion"""""""".
"
Ke lebaka la eng Jeremane e ile ya bitša tlhaselo go Britain?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Germany e theeile hlaselo """"""Operation sealion"""""""". This directly answers the question of why Germany initiated the offensive. While Dunkirk, Kriegsmarine, and the Royal Navy are mentioned, the passage clearly identifies ""Operation Sealion"" as the name of the planned invasion.
"
Ke eng seo se sa bolelwago bjalo ka kgato ye e nyakegago mo leanong la Italy la go thopa dinaga tša Afrika?,"The correct answer is **B: Go aga dikepe tša tlaleletšo (Building warships)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dinepo tše kgolo tša Italy e be e le dinaga tša Afrika. Go thopa dinaga tšeo, ba be ba tlo hloka go ba le hlomamišo ya madira, gore madira a kgone go selaganya Lewatle la Meuterranean gomme a šwahlele Afrika. Ka seo, ba ile ba tswanela ke go tloša metheo ya Britain le dikepe go la Egypt. **Gabjale go Japan. Japan e be ele naga ya sehlakahlake, bjalo ka Britain.**""

This implies that Italy needed warships to control the Mediterranean and reach Africa.  Option B, ""Go aga dikepe tša tlaleletšo (Building warships),"" directly addresses this need, while the passage says they didn't have a strong shipbuilding tradition to begin with.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tloša dikepe kua Egipita (Removing ships from Egypt):**  The passage says they *removed* British ships from Egypt, not that they needed to remove their own ships.
*   **C: Go hloma lefelo la go thomiša madira (Securing a place to store supplies):** While securing supplies was important, the passage focuses on the need for ships to transport supplies *and* the military power to enforce their control.
*   **D: Go senya metheo ya British (Destroying British ships):** The passage mentions removing British ships, not destroying them. It's a matter of control, not outright destruction.



"
"Go ya ka temana yeo ,ke eng seo se bego se lebelelwa e le morero o mogolo wa Italy wa ntwa?","The correct answer is **A: Go thopa dinaga tša Afrika**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dinepo tše kgolo tša Italy e be e le dinaga tša Afrika. Go thopa dinaga tšeo, ba be ba tlo hloka go ba le hlomamišo ya madira, gore madira a kgone go selaganya Lewatle la Meuterranean gomme a šwahlele Afrika."" (The major possessions of Italy were African lands. To conquer these lands, they would need to have a system of fortifications to be able to connect the Mediterranean Sea and reach Africa.)

While the other options are mentioned, they are presented as necessary *steps* to achieve the larger goal of conquering African lands.
"
Ke mang yo a ilego a hloma ditswalano tša bogwera le bahlasedi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ma-Vichy French**.

The text states: ""Batho ba ba France bao ba dirilego khutšo le ma-German ka 1940 ... ba lwantšhe."" This translates to ""The French people who collaborated with the Germans in 1940... betrayed [them]."" Therefore, the Vichy French are the ones who made deals with the Germans.
"
Ke dife tšeo di bego di akaretšwa go Operation Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Ma-Amerika le Sefora sa mahala (Free French)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bekeng tše pedi fela ma-Amerika le madira a Free French ba be ba lokolotše borwa bja Fora..."" (For only two forces, the Americans and the Free French, were advancing into Northern France...).
"
Tlhabollo ya theknolotši efe yeo e dirilego gore dikepe tša ka fase ga meetse di thome go sepela ka fase ga meetse?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mathomong a ntwa ba be ba sepelela kudu go ya bogodimo bja lewatl, efela ge radar e thoma go tšwelapele gomme e thoma go nepathwii dikepe tša ka fase ga meetse di gapeletšegile go ya ka fase ga meetse go efoga go bonwa.""

This translates to: ""Initially, submarines were mainly used to go to the surface, but when radar started operating and began to detect submarines, they became more adept at staying submerged to avoid being seen.""

Therefore, the development of radar allowed submarines to effectively operate underwater.
"
"Nakong ya go diriša ga mathomo, dikepe tša fase ga meetse di be di na le le lefelo le le lekanyeditšwego kudu lefelong lefe?","The correct answer is **A: Go sepela-sepela (To submerge)**.

The text states: ""Dikepe tša ka fase ga meetse di dikepe tšeo di diretšwego go **sepela ka fase ga meeste**..."" which translates to ""Submarine ships are ships that are designed to **submerge underwater**..."" This indicates that their primary function during initial use was to submerge.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo a robilego tumelelano? ","The correct answer is **D: Ma-Soviets**.

The text states that the Soviet Red Army invaded Poland after the attack on Polish border outposts and the violation of treaties by the Soviets. This indicates the Soviets were the ones who broke the agreement and initiated the invasion.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa phethagatšwago ke Madira a Mahwibidu?,"The correct answer is **D: Tumelelano ya go hlola molao (Treaty of Incorporation)**.

Here's why:

The text describes the Soviet invasion of Poland, including the violation of non-aggression pacts. Option D, the Treaty of Incorporation, refers to the Soviet Union's annexation of territories, which *did* happen as a result of the invasion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go hlolwa ga pele ga Se-Ukrainian (Pre-Ukrainianization):** This refers to a period *before* the Soviet takeover and doesn't directly relate to the invasion described in the text.
* **B: Tlhaselo ya dilete tša ka bohlabela (Massacre of the Polish Intellectuals):**  The text mentions the targeting of Polish intellectuals, but ""Massacre of the Polish Intellectuals"" is a specific event that occurred *after* the invasion, not a cause of it.
* **C: Go rulaganya lefsa ka thoko ga hlogo ya leporogo (Rapid Mobilization of the Red Army):** The text states that over 800,000 Soviet troops entered Poland. While there was mobilization, this option focuses on *how* they mobilized, not *what* was not a consequence of their actions.



Therefore, the Treaty of Incorporation (Annexation) is the option that is *not* directly a consequence described in the text.



"
Go diregile eng go Mo-Engineer yo Mogolo wa Madira a Lesome a Italy?,"The correct answer is **C: O ile a thopša ke Ma-British**.

The text states: ""Ma Britain a tswere Moentšenere o Mogolo wa Bošole bja Bolesome bja Italy, General Lastucci."" This translates to ""The British captured the Senior Engineer of the Bolesome Field of Italy, General Lastucci.""
"
Italo Balbo o bolailwe kae?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The passage states: ""On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, Lieutenant General of Libya and Mussolini’s favorite, was shot down while flying a plane over Tobruk.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya mekgwa ye e latelago yeo e lego karolo ye bohlokwa ya go naganišiša Se Tibetan?","The correct answer is **C: Go bona medimo ka leihlo la kgopolo (Seeing deities with the mind's eye)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Senta ya Tibetan meditation ke Deity Yoga. Ka go bona medimo a go fapafapana ditsela tša maatla di a hlwekišega, dichakra di a thakgolega gomme maitemogelo a lesedi a hlolega.""  This translates to: ""The essence of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By seeing various deities, powerful forces are awakened, chakras are activated, and light-like forms appear.""

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported by the text:

* **A: Go itlwaetša ditlwaetšo tša go hema (Practicing visualization techniques):** While visualization is part of Deity Yoga, the text highlights *seeing deities* as the core element.
* **B: Go boeletša mantras (Reciting mantras):** Mantras are mentioned as a tool used in yoga, but Deity Yoga's defining feature is seeing deities.
* **D: Go tseba maemo a Yoga gabotse (Knowing yoga positions well):** The text mentions yoga in relation to Kundalini awakening, but it doesn't emphasize detailed yoga postures as central to Tibetan practice. Deity Yoga focuses on the visualization of deities.



"
"Go ya ka temana, chakras di šomišwa bjang ka nakong ya bogare bja go naganišiša ga Tibetan?","The correct answer is **B: Ka go bona medimo ka leihlo la kgopolo (Through visualization of deities)**.

The text states: ""Senta ya Tibetan meditation ke Deity Yoga. Ka go bona medimo a go fapafapana ditsela tša maatla di a hlwekišega, dichakra di a thakgolega gomme maitemogelo a lesedi a hlolega."" This translates to: ""The essence of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing various deities, powerful forces are awakened, chakras are activated, and light emanations appear.""

Therefore, visualizing deities (medimo a go fapafapana) is the key method described for activating chakras (dichakra di a thakgolega) in Tibetan Buddhism.
"
Ke mang yo a ilego a emela koša ya bobedi ya go ineela nakong ya lenaneo?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

The text states: ""Seopedi Sanju Sharma o thomile bošego, a latela ke Jai Shankar Choudhary."" This translates to ""Singer Sanju Sharma started the program, followed by Jai Shankar Choudhary."" Therefore, Jai Shankar Choudhary was the second singer to perform.
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke mang yo a bego a emela koša ya go ineela nakong ya go abelana dijo?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ka morago, Lakkha Singh o etile pele go opeleng di bhajans.""  This indicates Lakkha Singh performed bhajans *after* the offering of the 108 Chhappan Bhog dishes.  Since he performed bhajans *after* the offering, it implies he was also involved in the offering itself. The text also mentions ""Lakkha Singh o file gape le chhappan bhog bhajan,"" further reinforcing his involvement in the ritual.



While other names are mentioned as performers of bhajans, Lakkha Singh is the one specifically connected to the Chhappan Bhog offering.



"
Ke mang yo a bilego tiragatšo ya bobedi ya mafelelo ya mantšiboa?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina le Haris Alexiou**.

The text states: ""Setsebalegi sa mosadi sa Turkey Sezen Aksu se diragaditše le seopedi sa thena sa moItaliana Alessandro Safina le seopedi sa Greek Haris Alexiou."" This directly identifies Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou as the second vocal performances mentioned.
"
Alessandro Safina ke setšhaba se sefe?,"The correct answer is **D: Italian**.

The text explicitly states: ""...seopedi sa thena sa moItaliana Alessandro Safina..."" which translates to ""...his Italian partner Alessandro Safina..."".
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke lefoko lefe go a a latelago leo le sego la nnete?","The answer is **D: ""Go tšere metsotso e ka bago e 60 go tloša motho wa mathome moswinking""**

Here's why:

The passage describes a very hot day (90 degrees) and the heat causing discomfort. Option D is the only one that describes a realistically plausible consequence of extreme heat - heatstroke. The other options are illogical or not mentioned in the text.

*   **A: Go ile gwa tuka mollo kua Santa Clara (A bear appeared in Santa Clara)** - Bears are not typically a concern in Santa Clara.
*   **B: Batho ba be ba palelwa ke go fologa di roller-coaster (People were being evacuated because of rollercoasters)** - This is unrelated to the heat described in the passage.
*   **C: Banamedi ba ile ba fiwa meetse (Doctors were given water)** - The text implies that people needed water, not that doctors were given it.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that logically follows the description of the heat and describes a possible outcome."
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo a boletšego mabapi le tekanyo ya phišo yeo e sa kgahlišego?","The correct answer is **B: Molaodi wa mollo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mokapoteni wa mollo Scott Kouns o rile..."" which translates to ""Fire Chief Scott Kouns said..."".  Therefore, Scott Kouns, the Fire Chief, is the one quoted as describing the dangerous situation.
"
Go bile le go kgaoga ga mohlagase kae ka lebaka la modiro wa tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""Ga go na tshenyego goba dikgobalo tše dikgolo tšeo di begilwego ka Tonga, efela mohlagase o be o sepetše lebakanyana..."" which translates to ""There was no damage or large debris from Tonga, only a slight wave...""

Therefore, the wave was felt in Tonga, although it wasn't severe.
"
"Go ya ka temana ye, Tonga e ile ya amega bjang ka kgaotšo ya mohlagase?","The correct answer is **B: Balaodi ga se ba hwetša ditaba mabapi le di temošo tšeo di tlošitšwego.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ga go na tshenyego goba dikgobalo tše dikgolo tšeo di begilwego ka Tonga, efela mohlagase o be o sepetše lebakanyana, moo o thibetšego balaodi ba Tonga go amogela temošo yeo e ntšhitšwego ya tsunami ka PTWC go ya ka dipego.""

This translates to: ""There was no tsunami warning or major damage in Tonga, only a small earthquake, where the Tonga authorities were unable to receive the tsunami alert issued by PTWC according to reports.""

Therefore, the Tonga authorities didn't receive news about the tsunami that was issued.
"
Ge re le maphodisa a kgona go šomiša dithunya tša ona tša radar go hwetša lebelo la go otlela la Johny Reid?,"The correct answer is **C: Ge a be a otlela ka lebelo la ka godimo ga 160km/h**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Jonny Reid went *faster* than 160km/h.
* The police had difficulty using their radar because the car was *below* the radar, meaning the radar couldn't accurately measure his speed.
* The police *only* managed to record his speed when he *reduced* it to under 160km/h.

Therefore, the only accurate statement about how they *could* have potentially measured his speed is that he was traveling *above* 160km/h initially.
"
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke ka lebaka la eng go le boima gore maphodisa a New Zealand a beye lebelo la Johny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: O be a otlela ka fase ga 160kh/h**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Maphodisa a New Zealand a bile le mathata ka go šomiša dithunya tša bona tša di speed radar go bona lebelo leo Mrn Reid a bego a le ketims ka lebaka la ka moo Black Beauty e lego fase ka gona, **ga šupa go feta leporogo**."" This means he was exceeding the speed limit *under* the bridge, making it difficult for the radar to accurately measure his speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Koloi e be e le fase kudu** - While the car being low *contributed* to the radar issue, it's not the primary reason the police had trouble getting an accurate reading.
*   **C: O ile a otlela ka godimo ga leporogo ka makga šupago** - The text says he was speeding *under* the bridge, not over it.
*   **D: Leporogo la Auckland Harbour ke la kgale kudu** - The age of the bridge isn't relevant to the police's difficulty in reading the radar.



"
Tšhišinyego ya lefase e be e lebane le kae ge e bapetšwa le Butte,"The correct answer is **B: 40 miles ka borwa**.

The text states: ""tekano yeo e ka bago 65 km (di mile tše 40) borwa bja Butte."" This translates to ""the magnitude could be 40 miles south of Butte.""
"
Ke eng seo se diregilego nakong ya meferefere kua Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Tlhorišo ya bagolegwa (Torture of prisoners)**.

The passage states that the Abu Ghraib scandal was exposed during the Iraq War and was a risk *after* it was revealed that prisoners were being tortured there after US forces took control.  The core issue was the torture of prisoners.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kiletšo ya mesepelo (Symbol of rebellion):** While Abu Ghraib became a symbol of the conflict, the immediate issue was not rebellion, but the abuse of prisoners.
* **C: Madira a US a ile a tšea taolo (US forces took control):**  This is a fact mentioned in the passage, but it's a *circumstance* that allowed the torture to happen, not the *what* that happened.
* **D: Kgolego e ile ya tšhungwa ka mollo (The prison was set on fire):**  While the prison may have suffered damage, the main issue was the abuse of prisoners.



"
Ke ka lebaka la eng kgolego ya Iraq e ile ya tuma gampe? ,"The correct answer is **D: Go utollwa ga tlhorišo ya bagolegwa** (The discovery of the torture of detainees).

Here's why:

* The question asks *why* the Abu Ghraib prison scandal became notorious.
* The passage states that the scandal emerged *after* the torture of detainees was discovered.  This discovery was the core of the problem and what made the scandal so widely known and condemned.
* Options A, B, and C are contributing factors, but not the primary reason for the scandal's notoriety. The *discovery of the torture* was the trigger.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text."
Ke tiragalo ya mohuta mang yeo e bego e swanetše go swarwa lepatlelong la Segopotšo sa Ntwa ya Maui?,"The correct answer is **A: Tiragatšo ya masalamose (Fire hazard)**.

The text states the group's departure was due to a fire hazard identified the following day. Therefore, the event that needed to be addressed was a fire hazard.
"
Ke mang yo mafelelong a ilego a nea tlhalošo mabapi le go phumolwa ga tiragalo ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Balaodi ba khamphani**.

The passage states: ""Khamphane ya bolaodi bja sehlopa, HK Management Inc., ga a fana ka lebaka la go kwagala..."" which translates to ""The group's management company, HK Management Inc., gave a reason for the cancellation...""

Therefore, the management company is the one providing the explanation.

Badudi ba mmalwa ba Bishkek ba be ba nagana gore ke bomang bao ba tšeago maikarabelo ka go thopša?,"The correct answer is **A: Bahlankedi ba phethagatšo ya molao (Law enforcement officials)**.

The passage states: ""Badudi ba mmalwa ba Bishkek ba šupa bagwanti ba go tšwa borwa ka monwana ka go hloka molao."" which translates to ""Several women in Bishkek are luring men from the south under the pretense of needing legal assistance.""  This means the women are posing as people needing legal help. Therefore, the men they are targeting are likely seeking legal counsel, making ""bahlankedi ba phethagatšo ya molao"" (law enforcement officials) the most logical answer.

While the passage mentions lawyers (""bashiomi ba molao""), it doesn't say the women are luring people *to* lawyers. They are posing as people needing assistance, which could imply they're trying to get close to anyone who might offer help, including law enforcement.  Option A is the closest fit given the context.
"
Ke mang yo a ilego a sola baipelaetši ba go tšwa ka borwa ka lebaka la go thopša?,"The correct answer is **A: Badudi ba Bishkek**.

The passage states: ""Badudi ba Bishkek ba šupa bagwanti ba go tšwa borwa ka monwana ka go hloka molao."" This translates to: ""Women of Bishkek are luring men from the south on the pretext of needing a lawyer.""
"
Naa Ring o tsebile neng ka go oketšega ga dithekišo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka morago ga go tšwelela go Shark Tank**.

The text states: ""Ditekišo di ile godimo ka morago ga go tšwelelela ga gagwe ka 2013 kgaolong ya Shark Tank...""  This directly indicates that Ring realized its potential after appearing on Shark Tank.
"
Naa Jamie Siminoff o tšere neng sephetho sa go thoma Ring?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka morago ga ponagalo ya Shark Tank yeo e paletšwego.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ditekišo di ile godimo ka morago ga go tšwelelela ga gagwe ka 2013 kgaolong ya Shark Tank..."" This means the success of their business really took off *after* appearing on Shark Tank. While the other options are related to Ring's history, the text directly links the surge in popularity to the Shark Tank appearance.
"
Tiragatšo ye nngwe le ye nngwe ya go bala ya Rainbow e ile ya nea bana ditšhitšhinyo mabapi le eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Dipuku**.

The text states: ""Reading Rainbow e rutile bana gore gobaneng ba bala,... lerato la go bala — [swantšho] e hlohleleditše bana go tšea buka le go bala."" (Reading Rainbow told children that whenever they read... the love of reading - [the show] encouraged children to pick up a book and read.) This clearly indicates that the show encouraged children to read *books*.
"
Ke eng seo se ka bago se bile le seabi ga go phumolwa ga mananeo a go bala a Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **A: Thušo ya tšhelete yeo e sa lekanego** (Lack of sufficient funding).

The text states: ""Ba bangwe ba dumela, go akaretša le John Grant, gore bobedi bja go phuhlama ga tša ditšhelete le šikinyego ka gare ga filosofi ya mananeo a telebišene a thuto di bile le seabe go feleng ga tatelano ya pontšo."" This translates to: ""Others agree, including John Grant, that both the funding and sponsorship aspects within the philosophy of educational television programs played a role in the cancellation of the show."" This indicates that lack of funding was a contributing factor to the show's cancellation. The other options are not mentioned as reasons for the cancellation in the text.



"
Ke fe ya tše di latelago yeo e bego e se ngangišano yeo e dirilwego ke bahlankedi bakeng sa Amsterdam le musiamo mabapi le sehlare?,"The correct answer is **D: Ke kotsi go maphelo a setšhaba (It is a threat to public health)**.

The passage states: ""Bahlankedi ba toropo ya Amsterdam le Museum wa Anne Frank ba bolela gore mohlare o fetetšwe ke fungus gomme o bea maphelo a setšhaba kotsing ge ba ngangišana gore o be o le kotsing ya go wa."" This translates to ""Authorities in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Museum say that a sample has been infected with fungus and poses a threat to public health if people come into contact with it.""

Therefore, the main concern discussed in the passage is the potential danger to public health.
"
"Go ya ka mohlahlobi yo mogolo wa RSPCA, ditlhahlobo di swanetše go ba le maemo bakeng sa efe ya tše di latelago?","The correct answer is **B: Mang le mang yo a šomago ka diphoofolo**.

The text states that CCTV cameras should be installed to send footage to people who work with animals, ensuring their lives are prioritized. Therefore, the inspections should be in place for the people working with animals.
"
"Go ya ka temana ye , ke eng seo se ka thušago go tiiša bohlokwa bja boiketlo bja diphoofolo bja bašomi ba Australia ba lefelong la go bolaya diphoofolo?","The correct answer is **A: Go lokelwa ga dikhamera tša CCTV (The installation of CCTV cameras)**.

The text explicitly states that the RSPCA is advocating for the installation of CCTV cameras in meat processing plants to improve animal welfare. David O'Shannessy says CCTV can ""send footage to people who work with animals so that their lives are placed before everything else.""

While the other options might contribute to animal welfare, the text *specifically* highlights CCTV as the proposed solution being championed by the RSPCA in this context.
"
"Go ya temana, mošomo wa motho yo a swerwego ke ofe?","The correct answer is **A: Moithuti**.

The passage states: ""yo a bego le tsebo ya nyakišišo o boditše Minneapolis Star-Tribune gore e be e le Louis Jourdain, morwa wa Modulasetulo wa Red Lake Tribal Floyd Jourdain wa mengwaga ye 16."" This implies that Louis Jourdain was a student (""moithuti""). The passage also mentions he was a 16-year-old, which further supports this.
"
"Go ya temana ye, ge ditaba di be di phatlalala mabapi le go swarwa gape, dipoloko di be di swarelwa bahlaselwa ba bakae?","The correct answer is **D: Nne**.

The passage states: ""Ditaba di boletše ga nnyake ka semolao ka go fetiša ba netefatša go tswarwa ga lehono. Le ge go le bjalo, yo a bego le tsebo ya nyakišišo o boditše Minneapolis Star-Tribune gore e be e le Louis Jourdain, morwa wa Modulasetulo wa Red Lake Tribal Floyd Jourdain wa mengwaga ye 16.

"
"Ge go be go arabelwa boipelaetšo, ke naga efe yeo e sa tšwelago pele ka tumelelano ya bona ya ACTA yeo e saennwego?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kgwedi ya go feta, go be go na le megwanto ye megolo ka Poland ge naga yeo e saena ACTA...gabjale."" This means Poland was the country that was actively opposing ACTA and refusing to ratify it.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dinaga dife go tše di latelago tšeo di tšerego sephetho sa go diegiša tshepedišo ya go tsenela ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The text states: ""Latvia le Slovakia bobedi di ditetše tshepedišo ya go tsenela ACTA."" This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia both announced their intention to join ACTA.""

While Latvia and Slovakia are mentioned, the question asks which countries *later* expressed their intention.  The text mentions that **Latvia and Slovakia** both *announced* their intentions.  Therefore, Latvia is listed as an option and is a correct answer.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Estonia:** Estonia is mentioned as a place where refugees are arriving, but not about expressing interest in ACTA.
*   **Lithuania:** Lithuania is mentioned as a place where refugees are arriving, but not about expressing interest in ACTA.
*   **Scotland:** Scotland is mentioned as a place where refugees are arriving, but not about expressing interest in ACTA.



"
Ke batho ba bakae bao ba gobetšego ka lebaka la ditiragalo tša go fiša kudu ga iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states: ""go tlogela batho ba bane ka dikgobadi tše nnyane"" which translates to ""affecting four people with small injuries"".
"
Ke mang yo a boletšego gore ditiragalo tša go fiša ga se tše šoro kudu,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The text states: ""Apple e di biditšego gore """"""ga di bohlokwa."""""""""" which translates to ""Apple called them """"""not important.""""""""""  Therefore, Apple is the one who said the recalls weren't a big deal.
"
"Nakong ya polelo, ke eng seo Steve Jobs sa Apple a bego a tlo se hlama gape?","The correct answer is **A: Histori**.

The quote states: ""Today Apple is innovating, We are going to make history.""  Steve Jobs explicitly mentions making history.
"
Morero wa polelo ya Steve Jobs ya diiri tše pedi e be e le ofe?,"The correct answer is **C: Go tšweletša sellathekeng se se mpsha** (To develop a new technology).

The quote ""Lehono Apple e hlola sellathekeng, Re tlo dira histori lehono"" translates to ""Today Apple is exploring technology, We are going to make history."" This clearly indicates an emphasis on innovation and development in the technology sector.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o tsebišitše eng kua dipapadi tša Argentine?,"The correct answer is **B: Maikemišetšo a gagwe a go kitima bakeng sa Senate**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mrs. Kirchner o tsebešitše ka maikemišetšo a gagwe a go nyaka go ba mopresidente Pontšhong ya Argentine..."". This directly indicates she announced her intention to run for president. While she also used her presidential platform, and the event was related to her Senate campaign, the *main* thing she announced was her presidential ambitions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bonkgetheng bja gagwe bja go ba mopresidente** - This is too broad. While it's related, the passage focuses on *what* she announced *during* that event.
*   **C: Lesolo la gagwe bakeng sa moemedi ya profense ya Buenos Aires** - This is about her political affiliation, not the announcement itself.
*   **D: Leano la gagwe la go fologa setulong bjalo ka senator wa bjale** - The passage doesn't mention anything about resigning her current seat.



"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o tsebišitše kae maikemišetšo a gagwe a go kitima?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka dipapadi tša Argentine tša bokgole bja dikhilomithara tše 31 kgole le Buenos Aires**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Setho sa mokgahlo sa bjalo le Mosadi wa Mo-presidente wa Argentine Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o tsebišitše bonkgetheng bja gagwe bja bopresidente maabane bošego La Plata, toropo ya go ba dikilomitara tše 50 (31 miles) kgole le Buenos Aires.""  This means she announced her commitment in the province of Buenos Aires, which is 31 miles (50 kilometers) from La Plata.
* Option C accurately reflects this information.
* Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they misrepresent the location and the relationship between La Plata and Buenos Aires."
Ke eng seo ACMA’s e hweditšego mabapi le Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Melao ya tlhahlobo ya dipuku e be e se ya robja**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ACMA found that Big Brother was not adhering to online content regulations because the content wasn't being kept on their website. This implies the regulations weren't being followed and were being ignored (or ""robja"" in Setswana).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Methopo ya ditaba e hweditšwe e bolokilwe wepsaeteng ya Big Brother** - The passage explicitly states that the content is *not* being kept on the website.
*   **C: Melao ya go tlhahlobo dipuku e be e robilwe** - The passage doesn't say the laws were changed. It says Big Brother wasn't following them.
*   **D: Diteng di hweditšwe di dula ka mmela go server** - The passage states the content *doesn't* stay on the server, which is the problem.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that ACMA found the regulations were not being followed, implying the regulations were not being adhered to."
Ke ditekanyetšo dife tšeo boraditaba ba swanetšego go wela ka fase ga tšona gore di kgone go tšewa bjalo ka diteng tša inthanete?,"The correct answer is **B: E swanetše go dula mmeleng wa server** (It must be located on a server).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Broadcasting Services Act e abela bakeng sa hlokomelo ya dikagare tša inthanete, efela gore di tšewe bjalo ka dikagare tša inthanete, e swanetše e dule ka gare ga server."" (The Broadcasting Services Act provides for the regulation of online content, but for it to be considered online content, it must be located on a server.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E swanetšwa go tšwelela mo go inthanete** (It must be accessible on the internet): While true that online content needs internet access, it's not the *defining* characteristic mentioned in the text for what constitutes ""online content"" for regulatory purposes.
* **C: E ka se bolokwe wepsaeteng** (It can be stored on a website):  This is incorrect. The text clearly says it *must* be on a server.
* **D: E swanetšwa go amogelwa ke ACMA** (It must be approved by ACMA):  The text mentions ACMA's role in regulating online content, but it doesn't say content *must* be approved by them to be considered online content in the first place.  The key is its location on a server.



"
Moetapela wa mokgahlo wa Liberal wa Australia ke mang?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text explicitly states: ""Peter Costello...monna yo a ka tlago a tsena le gatong la Tonakgolo John Howard ...go lahletše thekgo ya gagwe..."" This indicates Peter Costello was the leader of the Liberal party.
"
Ke ka lebaka la eng Australia e se ya hlwa e ena le intaseteri ye maatla ya nuclear?,"The correct answer is **C: Go kotsi kudu** (It's too dangerous).

Here's why:

* **The quote explicitly mentions concern about nuclear power.** Peter Costello says, ""Se sa ra gore, ga go na kganetšo ya molao go maatla a nuclear"" which translates to ""Because there is no legal framework for nuclear power."" This implies a significant risk and lack of regulation, making it too dangerous. 
* The other options aren't supported by the text:
    * **A: Go hloka thekgo ya setšhaba (Lack of public support):** The quote doesn't mention public opinion.
    * **B: Go ngangišano kudu (Too expensive):**  While nuclear power is expensive, the quote focuses on the dangers more directly.
    * **D: E tura kudu (Too complicated):** The quote doesn't discuss the complexity of nuclear power.



"
Ke mo-skier ofe yo a ilego a phadišana ka thušo ya mohlahli?,"The correct answer is **D: Anna Ogarzynska**.

The text states: ""Moruthi lehlweng wa banna bao ba sa bonego gabotse wa Poland Maciej Krezel **le mohlahli Anna Ogarzynska** ba feditše go la bo lesometharo ka gare ga Super-G."" This translates to ""The Polish women's coach Maciej Krezel **and commentator Anna Ogarzynska** finished in 28th place in Super-G.""
"
Ke naga efe yeo e feditšego maemong a lesome go Super-G sebakeng sa sehlopha sa basadi?,"The correct answer is **A: Finland**.

The passage states: ""Anna Jochemsen a fetša la bo senyane ka gare ga legoro la go ema la basadi ka gare ga di Super-G maabane, le **Finland ka Katja Saarinen a fetša la bo lesome moletlong wona woo**."" This translates to ""Anna Jochemsen finished second in the women's Super-G race, and **Finland's Katja Saarinen finished in tenth place**.""
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke polelo efe mabapi le Blake yeo e sego maleba?","The correct answer is **A: O ile a swarwa lefelong la tiragalo** (He was arrested at the scene of the incident).

Here's why:

* The text states ""Blake le yena o ile a bonwa molato ka go leka go kgopamiša toka."" (Blake was seen later trying to evade arrest). This implies he was at the scene, and was later apprehended.
* Option B is incorrect because the text says he was *evading* arrest, not arrested.
* Option C is not mentioned in the text.
* Option D is not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the only statement directly supported by the text is that Blake was seen trying to evade arrest, implying he was at the scene.
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa kago ya diragalela Blake?","The correct answer is **D: O ile a botšwa gore go bonagala a tla romelwa kgolegong?**

The text states: ""Moahlodi o boditše Blake go be go """"""tloga go sa kgonagale"""""""" o be a tlo romelwa kgolegong."" This translates to ""The prosecutor told Blake it would be """"""impossible"""""""" for him to be sent to prison.""  Option D reflects this directly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O ile a bonwa molato wa go kgopamiša toka** - While he *was* seen trying to evade arrest, this is a fact *about* him, not what the prosecutor said would happen.
* **B: O ile a swarwa** - The text doesn't explicitly state he was arrested. It says he was ""seen trying to evade arrest.""
* **C: O ile a hlaselwa ka kota** - There's no mention of him being assaulted.



"
Ke eng seo tšhelete ya U.N ya sekhwama sa borutho bja lefase e ka se šomišetšwego sona?,"The correct answer is **B: Go tliša theknolotši ditšhabeng tše di hlabologago.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""U.N. gape e holofela go feleletša tšhelete ya go thuša dinaga tšeo di amilwego ke burutho bja lefase ka bophara go phela ka ditlamorago. Tšhelete e ka lebišwa go dintlo tša go thibelwa mafula, bolaodi bjo bo kaone bja meetse, le tlatšo ya dimila.""  This translates to: ""The U.N. also aims to provide funds to help countries affected by global warming to live sustainably. The funds can be used for flood prevention homes, early warning systems for water disasters, and drought resistance crops.""

The options relate to how the U.N. might use funds. Option B, ""Go tliša theknolotši ditšhabeng tše di hlabologago,"" meaning ""To bring technology to vulnerable communities,"" is directly supported by the mention of early warning systems and drought-resistant crops - both forms of technology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go fapantšha dibjalo** (To develop plans): While planning is part of the process, the passage focuses on *funding* and *technology*, not the plans themselves.
* **C: Dintlo tšeo di sa tsenego mafula** (Flood-free homes): While flood-free homes are *an example* of what the funds can be used for, it doesn't represent the *purpose* of the funds. The purpose is to address global warming and its effects, and technology is the key tool.
* **D: Go fokotša ditlamorago tša go ruthetša ga lefase** (To reduce the effects of global warming):  The U.N. is working *to live sustainably* in the face of global warming, not directly *to reduce its effects* (although that is the ultimate goal). The passage is about adaptation, not mitigation.



"
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke eng seo U.N e holofelago go se phološa?","The correct answer is **A: Tšhelete, ka go abelana theknolotši**.

The passage explicitly states: ""U.N. gape e holofela go feleletša tšhelete ya go thuša dinaga tšeo di amilwego ke burutho bja lefase ka bophara go phela ka ditlamorago. Tšhelete e ka lebišwa go dintlo tša go thibelwa mafula, bolaodi bjo bo kaone bja meetse, le tlatšo ya dimila.""  It also mentions technology sharing.

Therefore, option A accurately reflects what the passage says the U.N. is trying to achieve.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa tsopolwago ke Albert Muchanga bjalo ka selo seo se sa swanetšego go kwana ka sona?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo melao e thomilego (With operational rules)**.

Here's why:

The quote explicitly states that the African Union (AU) was *not* ready to agree on trade rules, but they needed *sufficient structure* to be able to trade effectively from July 1, 2020.  This implies the need for **operational rules** to be in place.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ge nkabe Benin e ka ikgokaganya le AfCTA (If Benin can join AfCFTA):** The question is not about Benin's ability to join, but about the AU's readiness.
*   **B: Letšatšikgwedi leo le ka thomago (The week that can start):** The quote doesn't mention a specific week, but rather a date (July 1, 2020) for trade to begin.
*   **D: Ditumelelo tša go lefiša (Permissions to export):**  While export permissions are part of trade, the quote emphasizes the broader need for *operational rules* enabling trade.



Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting what Albert Muchanga *didn't* say or agree on is the need for **operational rules**."
"Go ya ka temana, ke ka lebaka la eng kgwebo e ka thoma ka Phupu/Julae?","The correct answer is **B: Go na le tlhako ye e lekanego ya melawana le ditumelelano tšeo di lego gona.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ga se satla re dumelelana ka melao ya ditefelo tša motšelo, efela sebopego seo bego le sona se lekane go thoma go gwebišana go thoma ka Julae 1, 2020."" This means that the necessary legal framework and agreements were in place by July 1, 2020, allowing trade to commence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage mentions Nigeria's entry into AfCFTA, it doesn't directly state that the July trade opening was *because* of Nigeria's entry. It's a condition for the overall AfCFTA agreement.
*   **C:** The Commissioner of Trade and Industry of AU *announced* the opening, but he didn't *set it up*. It was the legal framework that allowed the opening.
*   **D:** The passage mentions the lack of immediate agreement on trade rules but confirms the *existence* of sufficient legal frameworks and agreements. This indicates the rules were in place, but not perfect, by the July opening.



"
"Go ya ka temana ye, Atlanta Journal-Constitution e ile ya latofatša bahlankedi ba thuto ka eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go šitiša pego ya Journal ya Molaotheo**.

The passage states: ""Bohlatse ka morago ga fao bo laeditše dipampiri tša teko di šarakantšwe ke Hall, ga mmogo le bahlankedi ba thuto ba 34, bo laeditšwe ka 2013.""  This indicates that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a story/article about the test papers being leaked, which then led to the study participants being brought in for questioning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go palelwa ke go hlama thuto ya ditoropong tše mpsha:** The passage doesn't mention any study of new towns.
* **C: Go se dire selo ka mathata a ka gare ao a lemogilwego:**  The participants *did* do something – they were questioned after the leak was exposed.
* **D: Go bega teko ya fase:** While the leak was a problem, the question refers to what happened *to the participants* as a result of the leak being revealed. The passage doesn't directly say a new test was administered.



"
"Go ya ka tsebišo yeo e filwego mo temaneng,seo se sa bolelwago pegong ya Atlanta Journal-Constitution","The correct answer is **C: Mofenyi wa Molaodi wa Bosetšhaba wa Ngwaga wa 2013**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Hall was awarded the Superintendent of the Year award in 2009.
*   The passage specifically mentions that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published an article in 2013 regarding issues with test scores and the subsequent publication of manipulated test papers.
*   There is no mention of Hall receiving the National Teacher of the Year award in 2013. The passage focuses on the issues surrounding test score manipulation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kaonafatšo ya maemo a teko ye e sa tlwaelegago** - The passage states that test scores showed significant improvement, so this *is* mentioned.
*   **B: Bohlatse bja gore maphephe a tša diteko di ile tša šitišwa** - The passage *does* mention that manipulated test papers were published.
*   **D: Ditšhišinyo tša go hlama thuto ya ditoropong tše mpsha** - While the passage talks about improving schools, it doesn't focus on initiatives for urban schools specifically. However, it isn't something directly stated to be *not* in the article, so this is less definitively wrong than C.



Therefore, option C is the only one that is *not* mentioned in the provided text."
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke tshedimošo efe yeo e tsebjago ka morago ga go thuthupišwa ga sethuthupi?","The correct answer is **A: Palo ya mafelelo ya dikgobalo (Number of project failures)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dipego tše dingwe di bea palomoka ya semmušo ya mahu go seswai, gomme dipego tša semmušo di netefatša gore 30 e gobetše; efela dinomoro tša mafelelo ga sahla di tsebjwa."" This translates to: ""Other projects were reported to be in financial difficulty, and the service projects confirmed that 30 were completed; however, the number of project failures is expected.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions the *expected* number of project failures, making option A the correct answer.  The other options are either not mentioned or are inferences we can't draw from the text.
"
"Ge e sa le a tsenela Manchester City ka 2017,ke dipapadi tše kae tšeo Jesus a di bapetšego?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The question asks about the number of appearances Jesus made for Manchester City. The text states: ""Go tloga moo, Mabrazili a bile le dipapadi tše 53 tša sehlopa ka gare ga diphadišano ka moka..."" which translates to ""From there, Jesus had 53 appearances for the club in all competitions...""
"
Ke sehlopha sefe seo Jesus a amogetšego dimillione tše £27 tša tefo ya go tsenela?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The text states: ""Jesus wa mengwaga ye 21 o tsenetše sehlopa sa Manchester City..."" which translates to ""Jesus, at the age of 21, joined Manchester City...""
"
Ke polelo efe ka baeti ba hostele eo e sego nnete?,"The correct answer is **B: Baeng ba bangwe e be e se badudi ba lefelong leo** (Some of the guests were not women).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states ""Hostele e be bontši bja badudi ba United Arab Emirates"" (The hostel was mostly women from the United Arab Emirates). This implies that *not all* guests were women.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baeng ba be le Mecca bakeng sa leeto la bodumedi** (The guests were in Mecca for a pilgrimage) - This is true, the text states they were going to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage.
* **C: Baeng ba be ba le gona bošegong bja pele ga hajj** (The guests were there in the early stages of Hajj) - This is also true; the text mentions they arrived before the Hajj pilgrimage.
* **D: Bontši bja baeng ba be ba etšwa motseng o mokgethwa** (Many of the guests were from the holy city) - This is true, they were from the United Arab Emirates, a location close to Mecca.



Therefore, the only false statement is that all the guests were women.



"
"Go ya ka setsopolwa, ke efe ya dipolelo tše di latelago yeo e le go nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Baeng ba be ba le gona bošegong bja pele ga leeto la bodumedi la hajj.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Moago o tswere basepedi ba tša bodumedi bao ba tlilego go tla go etela motse o mokgethwa bošegong bja pele ga hajj pilgrimage.""  This translates to ""The guide announced the pilgrims who arrived to visit the holy city in the early stages of the hajj pilgrimage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go be go sena mahu** (There was a shortage of water): The text says the water supply was *increased* to 15, not that there was a shortage.
* **B: Baeng ka moka ba be ba etšwa United Arab Emirates** (Most of them came from the United Arab Emirates): The text states the hostel was *full of* people from the UAE, but doesn't say *most* of the pilgrims were from there.
* **D: Bontši bja baeng e be e le badudi ba lefelong leo ba Mecca** (Many of them were women from the age group of Mecca): The text doesn't mention the age group of the pilgrims, only that they were pilgrims.



"
"Go ya temana, ke tshedimošo efe mabapi le thulano yeo e sa kgonthišegego?","The correct answer is **B: Lefelo la thulano**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ba sa leka go laodiša gore naa thulano yeo e be e le ye kgolo ga kae gomme Lefase le tlo amega ka tsela efe."" This directly translates to: ""They are trying to determine *where the debris originated* and how the Earth will be affected.""

The other options are not the primary focus of the information provided:

*   **A: Bogolo bja thulano (Size of the debris):** While the initial amount of debris is mentioned (1000 pounds), the *location* of the debris is the main concern.
*   **C: Dithulano di amile lefase (Normal debris):** The focus is on an *unusual* debris event.
*   **D: Lefelo la ditlakala (Location of the impact):**  The text says they're trying to find where the debris *originated* (the launch point), not where it landed.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se sa sa swanetšego ke go laolwa mabapi le thulano ye?","The correct answer is **A: Ke mang yo a tlago go swaragana le go latišiša ditlakala?**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bolaodi bja Maano bja United States bja kantoro ya Kgoro ya Tšhireletšo ya U.S. e šetše mohlala wa debris morago. Poelo ya tlhahlobo ya leano e tla romelwa godimo ga wepesaete ya setšhaba.""

This indicates the U.S. Department of Defense is responsible for tracking and reporting on the debris.  The question asks who is responsible for coordinating and releasing information.  Option A directly addresses this responsibility.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **B: Disathalaete di be di sepela ka lebelo le le ka kaang nakong ya thulano:** The passage gives the distance traveled, but not the speed.
* **C: Ka moo dipolelo tša tshekatsheko ya go loga maano di tlago go abelana:**  While there might be coordinated efforts, the passage doesn't focus on the specific locations of those efforts.
* **D: Tekanyo ye e nepagetšego ya go thula:** The passage mentions the debris's size and distance, but not a specific calculated ""quantity"" of debris.

"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke lefelo lefe leo Batten a kilego a le swara lenaneong la bahumi ba go huma kudu ba Amerika?","The correct answer is **A: 400th**.

The question states: ""Batten o be a beilwe maemong a bo 190 ka 2008 lelokelong la ma-America a 400 a go Huma kudu..."" which translates to ""Batten was a fellow in the 400th American expedition to space in 2008...""

Therefore, he was part of the **400th** expedition.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo Batten a ilego a neela go yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Lenaneo leo le humilego kudu Amerika (Highly successful American program)**.

The passage states: ""Batten o be a beilwe maemong a bo 190 ka 2008 lelokelong la ma-America a 400 a go Huma kudu ka lehumo la go leka dibilion tše $2.3."" This translates to ""Batten was appointed to a position in 190 of the 400 most successful American programs by 2008, with a benefit of $2.3 billion.""

While the other options are related to Batten's background, the key takeaway from the passage is that he was involved with one of the most successful American programs. Therefore, option A is the best fit.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yunibesithi ya Virginia (University of Virginia):** This is where he *graduated* from, not where he worked or led a successful program.
*   **C: Palo ye bohlokwa ya dihlongwa (Important position of power):** While he had a position, the passage emphasizes the success of the program he was associated with, not the position itself.
*   **D: Dikholetše tšeo di ineetšego go tša bokgabo le mahlale (Integrated colleges of arts and sciences):** This describes the *type* of institution he came from, not the success he achieved.



"
Ke eng seo e sego karolo ya malaokakanywa wo o saenwego ke mmuši Arnold Schwarzernegger?,"The correct answer is **C: Thibelo ya rekiša goba go hira ya dipapadi tša video tše šoro go bana ba banyenyane ka ntle ga California**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the law applies **specifically within California**.  The law focuses on restricting the sale or rental of video games *within* the state.
* The passage details the requirements for video game ratings and parental controls *within* California.
* The other options are mentioned in the passage:
    * **A:**  The law *does* restrict sales/rentals of these videos to minors in California.
    * **B:** The passage mentions a fee of $1000 for parental controls.
    * **D:** The passage mentions a specific decal for games with content deemed inappropriate.



Therefore, the only option that is *not* part of the law is the restriction on sales/rentals outside of California.

"Go ya ka temana,ke mang yo a ilego a foša dilo tšeo di bego di bolelwa?","The correct answer is **A: Bana ba Duvall**.

The quote says ""Mike o bolela kudu ka nako ya teeletšo...Ke be ke itokišetša kafao ke be ke sa kwe gabotse gore o be a reng."" which translates to ""Mike talked a lot during the interview... I was preparing for it and I couldn't hear what he was saying.""  The ""Ke"" in the sentence refers to Duvall, indicating *he* was the one who couldn't hear. Therefore, Duvall is the one who missed what Mike was saying.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e lego ya nnete ka maitemogelo a Miller tshekong?","The correct answer is **A: Duvall o ile a ba le kgopolo go Miller nakong ya tsheko.**

Here's why:

* The quote from Miller says, ""...Mike o bolela kudu ka nako ya teeletšo...Ke be ke itokišetša kafao ke be ke sa kwe gabotse gore o be a reng."" (Mike talked a lot during the interview...I was preparing and I couldn't hear what he was saying). 
* This implies that Miller was distracted by Duvall talking a lot. He wasn't paying attention to what Duvall was saying during the interview.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O be a sa ele hloko ge a be a itokišeletša:** The quote explicitly states Miller *was* preparing.
* **C: Bana ba babedi ba Duvall ba ile ba bolela kudu nakong ya tsheko:** The quote refers to *Mike* talking a lot, not Duvall's children.
* **D: O be a ela hloko kudu kanegelong ya Duvall:** The quote implies he wasn't paying attention to Duvall.

Therefore, the most accurate conclusion is that Duvall talked a lot during the interview and distracted Miller.
"
Ke mang a šišanyago gore go dirwe diphetošo go ‘ Molao wo o hlwekilego’?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The text states: ""Layton **kgopetše diphetogo** go molaokakanywa wa tikologo..."" which translates to ""Layton **urged changes** to the environmental law...""

While Stephen Harper is the Prime Minister and John Howard is another politician mentioned, Jack Layton is specifically identified as the one advocating for changes to the law.
"
Ke mang yo a ilego a ganetša gore “ Clean Air Act” e be e šomišwa bjalo ka go dira dilo ka pele ga dikgetho?,"The correct answer is **C: Moetapele wa NDP**.

The text states: ""Layton, the NDP leader, urged changes to the protection of environmental laws during the meeting with the PM, urging ""a rewrite of the laws to ensure they are implemented”."" This directly indicates Jack Layton, the NDP leader, opposed the way the Clean Air Act was being sent forward.
"
Metswako ya cyanuri acid le melamine e ile ya bopa eng ge e kopana le moroto wa dikatse?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikristale**.

The passage states: ""Diripa tše di arabelana mmogo go dira di crystal tšeo di ka thibelago go šoma ga dipšhio..."" which translates to ""The compounds combine to form crystals that can prevent the formation of tartar...""

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
Ke eng seo banyakišiši ba ilego ba diriša infrared spectroscopy go se lebelela?,"The correct answer is **B: Sebopego sa crystal ka gare ga moroto wa phoofolo ya ka gae**.

Here's why:

* The question states that infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to *compare the patterns* of the crystals found in the animal urine with the crystals found in the human urine. 
* FTIR is a technique used to identify the molecular structure and, therefore, the **composition and arrangement (the ""sebopego"") of materials**. By comparing the FTIR spectra, the researchers were able to determine that the crystals in both urine samples had the same composition, which they attributed to a combination of melamine and cyanuric acid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mošomo wa dipshio (The work of the stoves)**:  The question is about the crystals found in urine, not stoves.
* **C: Diphoofolo tša ka gare tšeo di amegilego (The aged animals inside)**: The study focuses on the crystals in urine, not on the aged animals themselves.
* **D: Dijo tša diphoofolo tša ka gae tšeo di šilafatšego (The processed animal foods)**: While processed animal foods *might* contain melamine and cyanuric acid, the question is about the crystals found in urine, indicating the presence of these substances after processing.



"
Ke mang yo a ilego a bolela ka Luna e le “kgošigadi ya go Feteletša”?,"The correct answer is **A: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels o boletše gore """"""""Luna o be a sa swane le ba bangwe bjalo ka nna... mohlomongwe go feta moo... ke a mo rata gape ke tla mo gopola... ka kholofelo o madulong a makaone.""""""""""  This translates to ""Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said that """"""Luna was different from others like me... maybe even more... I also love her and I will find her... with faith in the afterlife.""""""  Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who called Luna ""kgošigadi ya go Feteletša"" (Queen of Extreme).
"
Ke mang yo a ilego ka bolela ka Luna bjalo ka “freaky”?,"The correct answer is **A: Banyakišiši ba mmušo (WrestleMania).**

The text states: ""Boraedikakadipana-mmogo le bona ba laetše Luna."" which translates to ""They (the WrestleMania announcers) also welcomed Luna.""  The question asks who called her ""freaky"". While Tommy Dreamer describes her as ""freaky"" in a positive way, the question asks who *called* her that. The announcers welcomed her, implying they are the ones speaking about her.



"
Ke eng seo se sa diragago go mootledi yo a amegilego kotsing yeo?,"The correct answer is **A: O ile a gobala hlogong (He died).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mootledi wo thulano e diregilego gona o tswaletšwe nakwana ge ditirelo tša thušo ya ka pela di lokolotšego mootledi gotšwa ka gare ga Audi TT ye khwibedu.""  This translates to: ""The person involved in the accident was pronounced dead after the emergency services managed to extract the person from the crashed Audi TT.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ga se a gobatša le gee le ofe wa batho bao bego ba le ka gare ga legae (He didn't speak to anyone of the people who were in the car with him):** The passage doesn't mention whether he spoke to anyone.
*   **C: O ile a fetišetšwa sepetlele sa Cambridge go ya sepetlele sa Great Yarmouth (He was transferred to a hospital in Cambridge from a hospital in Great Yarmouth):** The passage says he was *taken* from Great Yarmouth to Cambridge, implying he died during the transfer.
*   **D: Ditirelo tša tšhoganetšo di ile tša mo thuša go mo tloša ka koloing ya gagwe (Emergency services helped to extract him from the car):** The passage says they *managed to extract him*, but it doesn't state he survived. The focus is on his death.



"
Ke eng seo se bego e se selo seo se ilego sa tšwelela ka papadi ya South Africa nakong ya phadišano ya rugby?,"The correct answer is **D: Bokgoni bja go itšhireletša (Defense)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tšhireletšo ya bona molao, makgone a bona a go swara bolo le mošomo wo mo botse wa sehlopa go ba dirile gore ba kgethege gomme go be go le molaleng gore se e be e le sehlopa sa go fenywa.""  This translates to: ""Their disciplined defense, their ability to tackle the ball, and the teamwork enabled them to gain momentum and become a formidable team.""

While the other options contributed, the passage highlights **defense** as the key factor in their success and ability to win.  The ability to tackle (B) is *part* of defense.  The initial momentum (C) was a result of their defense.  But the underlying strength mentioned is their defense.



"
"Go ya ka temana, papadi ya Africa Borwa e thomile neng go kaonafala?","The correct answer is **A: e thomile ka 10:00am**.

The text explicitly states: ""Papadi e thomile ka 10:00am..."" which translates to ""The match started at 10:00am...""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dipolelo dife tše di latelago tšeo di sa bontšhego ka mo go nepagetšego ka moruo wa China?","The correct answer is **C: China e ka feleletša e na le GDP e kgolo go feta United States.**

Here's why:

The text states that China's GDP *could* exceed the United States' in the coming decades. This is presented as a *potential* future outcome, not a guaranteed or certain one. The other options are supported by the information in the text:

* **A: Moruo wa China o gotše kudu ga e sa le e dira diphetogo:** The text explicitly mentions China's significant economic transformation.
* **B: China e na le mmaraka o mogolo wa diromelwantle tša dikoloi go feta United States:** The text says China's exports surpassed Germany and the US, indicating a large export market including vehicles.
* **D: China ga se ya romela dikoloi tše dintši go feta Jeremane dinageng tša ka ntle:** The text says China surpassed Germany in exports, meaning China *does* export a large number of vehicles.

Therefore, the only option that represents a *potential* future event, not a certainty as stated in the text, is that China's GDP will surpass the United States'.



"
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke neng moo China ie ilego ya feta United States ka GDP?","The answer is **A: Go latela diphetogo tše dintši tša ekonomi** (Following many economic changes).

The text states that China's economy has grown significantly over the past 90 years, becoming the largest market for exports and potentially surpassing the US in GDP in the coming decades. It doesn't specify *when* China will surpass the US, but rather that it's a result of ongoing economic changes.  The other options are too specific and not supported by the text.
"
Hu o ile a šišinya gore dinaga tše di hlabologago di direng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tšea ditlamo tšeo di kgorometšago kgato ya bona tlhabollo (To pursue emissions reductions that are commensurate with their developmental capacity.)**

Here's why:

The quote states:  """"""""ga ba swanela, kafao, go kgopelwa go tšea dikgapeletšo tšeo di yago go feta maemo a bona a tšwelopele, maikarabelo le makgone.""""""""""""""  This translates to: ""they must, in effect, be expected to pursue emissions reductions that are commensurate with their developmental capacity, opportunities, and capabilities.""

The key phrase is ""commensurate with their developmental capacity"" which directly relates to pursuing emissions reductions *according to their development level*. Option A reflects this accurately.
"
Ke eng seo se sa kago sa bolelwa ke Hu?,"The correct answer is **D: Palo ya go fokotša go ntšha ga carbon** (The number of carbon emission reduction).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Hu didn't provide a specific number for carbon emission reduction. He mentioned that those would be determined based on China's economic progress.
* Option A is incorrect because the passage doesn't focus on a ""core message"" but rather on a series of statements about policy and approach.
* Option B is partially true, as he mentioned looking at countries that have successfully transitioned. However, he didn't explicitly give ""advice"" to these countries.
* Option C is incorrect because he expressed the need for *setting goals* that exceed current levels, not a prediction of success or a specific pathway for future reduction.

Therefore, the most accurate statement of what Hu *didn't* say is that he didn't provide a specific *number* for carbon emission reduction.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo Veerman a boletšego gore boemo ga se bjo bobotse?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The passage states: ""Angola e ya phulegong ya yona ye šoro go feta gomme maemo a dula e le a go se kgahliše go la Angola."" This translates to ""Angola's drought is worsening and the situation remains dire in Angola.""  Richard Veerman specifically mentions the situation in Angola as being dire.
"
"Ke ka lebaka la botšhotšhisi, ke mang yo atla go tšea maemo a Huhne a Kabinete?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP o letetšwe go tšea mošomo wa bo Tona bja tša Kgwebo woo Davey a o tlogelago."" This translates to ""Norman Lamb MP was asked to take over the position of Business Secretary that Davey is resigning from."" Therefore, Davey is the one who will be taking Huhne's former cabinet position.
"
Ke mang yo a tlago go tšea karolo ya Tona ya kgwebo ka morago ga botšhotšhisi,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP o letetšwe go tšea mošomo wa bo Tona bja tša Kgwebo woo Davey a o tlogelago."" This translates to ""Norman Lamb MP was asked to take over the position of Business Secretary that Davey is resigning from.""
"
Badiragatši ba go hlohleletša batheetši go direga eng ka nakong ya opera ya Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **C: Eba le nona sefaleng nakong ya tiragatšo**.

The text states: ""badiragatši ba tsuba lebake sefaleng, gomme teatere e hlohleletša ba bogedi go tšea karolo go se."" This translates to ""the performers are climbing onto the roof, and the theater is arranging the stagehands to participate in it.""  The context implies the performers are climbing onto the roof *during the opera*.
"
Ke mang yo kudukudu a gogago malokolo nakong ya opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Badiragatši**.

The text states: ""Badiragatši ba tsuba lebake sefaleng, gomme teatere e hlohleletša ba bogedi go tšea karolo go se."" This translates to ""The actors cried on the stage, and the theater encouraged the audience to participate in it."" Therefore, the actors were the ones crying/reacting emotionally during the opera.
"
Ke leina le lengwe la “spacewalk” yeo Leonov a e dirilego?,"The correct answer is **C: Mošomo wa ka ntle ga koloi (Spacewalk)**.

The text explicitly states that on August 18, 1965, Leonov performed the *first* manned extravehicular activity (EVA), which is another term for a spacewalk.  Option C directly reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ponelopele ya Apollo-Soyuz (Apollo-Soyuz docking)** - This was a later event, not the spacewalk Leonov is known for.
* **B: Lebelo la sebakabaka (Space ambition)** - This is a general concept, not a specific spacewalk.
* **D: Mosepedi wa lefaufaung wa No.11 (Cosmonaut No. 11)** - This is Leonov's title, not the name of a specific spacewalk.
"
Leonov o ile a etelela pele karolo ya ponelopele ya Soviet efe?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Mengwaga ye lesome ka morago, o etetše karolo ya Soviet ya morero wa Apollo-Soyuz go šupa gore Space Race se fedile.""  (Twenty years later, he participated in the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz program to mark the end of the Space Race.)
"
Ke mang yo a gobetšego kotsing yeo?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""Gibson o ile a išwa bookelong efela a hlokofala nakwana ka morago ga fao."" which translates to ""Gibson was taken to the hospital only suffering minor injuries afterward."" This indicates Gibson was the one involved in the accident.
"
Go diregile eng ka batho bao ba akaretšwago kotsing yeo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba be ba goeletša e bile ba lla**.

The text states: ""Go be go na le bana bao ba bego ba emetše go tsela mmila gomme ba be ba goelela ebile ba lla."" This translates to ""There were children who had been waiting on the side of the road for miles and were crying.""
"
Bo-ramahlale bao ba šomago lenaneong le ba be ba holofetše go bona ditlamorago tšeo di bakwago le efe ya tše di latelago?,"The correct answer is **B: Maatla a maphoto (Photographic power)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Borasaentsheba kgonne go fetša ka la gore dark matter e ama di dark matter stše dingwe ka tsela ya go tswana le ka moo matter wa go tlwaelega o dirago. **Theory ye e re bontši bja dark matter go dukuluga galaxy go hwetšwa tikologong ya galaxy ka halo ye itšego, gomme e dirilwe ka dikarolwana tše dintši tše dinnyane.**""

This means the scientists were able to study the gravitational effects of dark matter, and their analysis suggests the dark matter isn't just clumped together, but distributed in a halo around the galaxy, composed of many small components. They studied the *photographic power* (light) coming from the galaxy to understand this distribution.  They looked at the Milky Way as it consumed the Sagittarius galaxy and analyzed the photographic images.

The other options are less relevant:

*   **A: Taba ya ka mehla (Daily news):** This is irrelevant to the scientific investigation.
*   **C: Dikarolwana tše nnyane (Small components):** While the passage mentions small components, it's the *photographic power* that allowed them to *detect* these components.
*   **D: Taba ya leswiswi (Wisdom news):** This is irrelevant to the scientific investigation.



"
Bo-ramahlale ba be ba lebelela taba ya gore ke efe ya tše di latelago?,"The correct answer is **B: Lefase la molalatladi wa dinaledi wa Sagittarius**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists were examining images of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The question asks what they were *expecting* to find. The passage specifically mentions they were hoping to find evidence related to the *surface* of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and the interaction between its dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter. Therefore, the surface of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy is the most logical thing they were looking for.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Tsela ya maswi le Ngwedi:** While the Milky Way and the Moon are mentioned, the focus of the research is on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, not these celestial bodies themselves.
*   **C: Lefase le Ngwedi:** Same reason as A. The primary focus is on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
*   **D: Molalatladi wa di naledi wa Sagittarius la Tsela ya Lefaufau:** The passage focuses on the Sagittarius *dwarf* galaxy, not a larger Sagittarius galaxy related to the Milky Way.

Therefore, the researchers were primarily focused on the **surface of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy**.
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke eng seo se sa solwago ke bašireletši ba dilo tše di bolokago dilo tše dingwe?","The correct answer is **A: Tšhomišo ya tšhelete ya kimollo (Federal funding)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yeo lebeledi ba ditšhelete ba go boletšego ka go swaswa gore ke """"""Kwano ya Bush ya New Orleans."""""" Diswai-phošo tša tokologo ya maitapišo a go agwa-leswa di lebišitše šedi go kafao dikontraka tša go aga-leswa go ba goba ka gare ga Washington.""

This translates to: ""Which was reportedly described as the ""Bush Plan for New Orleans.""  Normal audits of construction spending revealed that a large portion of construction contracts were awarded within Washington.""

The implication is that federal funds were involved and improperly allocated or managed. The text highlights concerns about financial mismanagement related to the federal funding.  The other options are not directly addressed or the main point of the passage:

* **B: Go hloka maiteko a go aga lefsa (Lack of building inspections):** While potentially a factor, the text doesn't explicitly say lack of inspections was the core issue.
* **C: Ke mang yo fiwago dikonteraka tša go aga lefsa (Who was awarded the construction contracts):** The text mentions contracts *were* awarded within Washington, implying a problem with *where* the contracts were awarded, not *who* specifically.
* **D: Tšhomišo ya tšhelete ya go aga lefsa (Construction spending):** This is too general. The specific concern is the *federal* funding.



Therefore, **A: Tšhomišo ya tšhelete ya kimollo** is the most accurate answer, representing the primary issue of financial mismanagement highlighted in the passage.



"
Ke mang yo a solago dikonteraka tša go aga lefsa sebakeng sa maiteko a tlhakodišo ya Ledimo la Katrina?,"The correct answer is **C: Sethokgwa**.

The passage states that ""Diswai-phošo tša tokologo ya maitapišo a go agwa-leswa di lebišitše šedi go kafao dikontraka tša go aga-leswa go ba goba ka gare ga Washington."" This implies that the opposition to the construction contracts was coming from within the government, which would align with the idea of the Republican party (often referred to as ""Sethokgwa"" in Sesotho).  The phrase ""Kwano ya Bush ya New Orleans"" further points to Republican involvement.
"
"Go ya ka temana ye, mabone a tšwago sefofaneng sa Stardust a tla bonagala kae pele?","The correct answer is **B: Northern California**.

The text states that the Stardust capsule will be visible to people in Northern California, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah. It specifically mentions the capsule will be deployed to ""make a self-destruction for people in Northern California...""

Therefore, Northern California is the region where the Stardust spacecraft will be visible *first* according to the text.
"
"Go ya ka temana, sefofane se tla bea rekoto yeo e beilwego sebakeng sa efe ya tše di latelago?","The correct answer is **C: Go boela Lefaseng ka lebelo kudu** (Return to Earth with a high probability).

The passage states: ""Stardust se tla bea rekoto ye ntswa ya goba sefofa-sebakeng sa lebelobelo sa go boa Lefaseng..."" which translates to ""Stardust will set a new record as the first spacecraft expected to return to Earth...""

While the spacecraft will travel over California and surrounding states, the main achievement being highlighted is the return to Earth. The other options are either details of the mission path or secondary impacts, not the primary record being set.
"
Ngaka. Malar Balasubramanian o be a tswala bjang le Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Mma**.

The text states: ""O hweditšwe mmele wa Saroja Balasubramanian, 53..."" which translates to ""They found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53...""  This directly indicates that Saroja Balasubramanian is the mother of Malar Balasubramanian.



"
Setopo sa Sara Balasubramanian se hweditšwe kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka thoko ga tsela (Along a highway)**.

The passage states: ""Ngk. Malar Balasubramanian, 29, o hweditšwe ka Blue Ash, Ohio, toropo yeo e lego di mile tše 15 lebowa la Cincinnati a **robetše fase ka theko ga tsela** ka sekhipa le dikobo tša ka gare seemong seo a nwelego mereana kudu.""  This translates to ""Mr. Malar Balasubramanian, 29, was found in Blue Ash, Ohio, a town 15 miles from Cincinnati, **lying along the highway** in the area where he had been driving for many years.""
"
Seo se hweditšwego ke eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states: ""...eBay...holofela go patlalatša methopo ya yona ya letseno le go hwetša tumo mafelong ao Skype se tswerego maemo a matla...""  This means eBay was trying to gain a foothold in markets where Skype was already strong.
"
Ke eng seo eBay e nyakago go se fihlelela ka hwetša?,"The correct answer is **B: Go golela mafelong a mangwe (To expand into other markets)**.

The text states that eBay is focusing on expanding its presence in markets where Skype has found success, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This directly indicates a goal of growth in new markets.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Go kopanya letseno la yona (To consolidate its market share):** While maintaining market share is important, the text emphasizes expansion into new areas, not just strengthening its current position.
* **C: Go godiša maemo a yona (To strengthen its position):** Similar to A, this focuses on existing markets, not new ones.
* **D: Go kgotsofatša beng dišere ba yona (To improve its customer service):** The text doesn't mention customer service as a primary goal.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mang yo a sa dirišanego le bagolegwa bao ba ilego ba šala ka jarateng ka morago ga ntwa?","The correct answer is **A: Barerišani ba ditherišano (Negotiators)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that negotiators *tried to persuade* the hostages. This indicates they were attempting to resolve the situation peacefully.
* The police and SWAT team were actively involved in responding to the hostage situation.
* The attackers are clearly identified as ""bahlankedi"" (terrorists/attackers).
* The police officers were trying to rescue the hostages from the house.

Therefore, the negotiators are the group who *didn't* participate in the violent actions taken against the hostages.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ilego ya feleletša e dirile gore bagolegwa ba boele morago go meferefere?,"The correct answer is **B: Gase ya go tšholla megokgo (tear gas)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""E se kgale, bašomedi bamolao ba go hlama ka diaparo tša dikgaruru ba tsene ka lapeng gomme ba beela bagolegwa sekhutwaneng ka tear gas.""  This means tear gas was used, and it's the most direct and likely reason the hostages eventually left. The text doesn't mention successful negotiations, hostage-negotiators, or the police being the reason for the hostages' departure.

"Ke kgopolo efe ya Ali Khamenei, naga ya Iran e swanetšego go itokolla go eng?","The correct answer is **B: Phetogo ya Islamic**.

The text states: ""Moetapele o mogolo wa naga, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, o hlalosetše boikemo go ole bjale ka """"""molaba"""""""" wo o thomilego pele ga phetogelo ya Iran ya se-Islam ka 1979 gomme boo naga e swanetšego go itokolla go tšwa go bona.""  This directly links Khamenei's statement to the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and Iran needing to ""itokolla go tšwa go bona"" (break free from it).
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo ilego a dumela ditlamorago tša dikiletšo tša moruo wa Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Methopo ye megolo (Major Iranians)**.

The text states: ""Dikarabelo, thwii telebišening, e be e le sa pele moo **ma-Iranian a magolo** a dumetšego gore melao yeo e na le ditlamorago."" (In a report, for the first time, **major Iranians** agreed that the laws had drawbacks.)

While OPEC and Ayatollah Khamenei are mentioned, the question asks *who* agreed to the drawbacks. The text explicitly states that *major Iranians* were the first to do so.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sego karolo ya tshepedišo ya go bouta ya France?,"The correct answer is **D: Di-boutu di balwa ke bonkgetheng ba baemedi (Police officers calculate the bonuses)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Bošegong, diboutu di balwa ke baithaopi ka tlase ga tlhokomelo ye kgolo, go latelwa ditsela tša maleba."" (Generally, bonuses are calculated by the auditors, according to a major importance, followed by established procedures.) This means the police officers themselves *don't* calculate the bonuses.

Let's look at why the other options are correct parts of the process:

* **A: Mapokisi a go bouta ao a lego pepeneneng (Police officers who are visible):** The text says that since 1988, police officers have been required to be visible so that citizens can verify the presence of the money and the absence of missing or altered funds.
* **B: Baemedi bao ba rometšwego ke bonkgetheng (Auditors sent by the bank):** The text states that banks can send auditors to verify each part of the guarantee.
* **C: Go saena lenaneo la go bouta (Signing the guarantee program):** The text mentions signing the guarantee as part of the process.



"
Bakgethi ba laetša kae bonkgetheng bao ba ba kgethilego?,"The correct answer is **C: Godimo ga onfolopo**.

The passage states: ""...ba bea pampiri yeo e tlogilego e gatišitše ya go laetša bankgetheng bao ba kgethegilego ka gare ga onfolopo."" which translates to ""...they placed the discarded paper, which was sent to the bank they had chosen, inside the envelope.""
"
Ke eng seo se dirilego gore Allen a thome go tsoma ba ga Musashi ka ngwaga wa seswai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lehumo la gagwe (His experience)**.

The text states: ""Allen o beeleditše bontši bja lehumo la gagwe go tebelelo ya diphedi tša lewatle gomme a thoma leeto la gagwe la go hwetša Musashi ka poelo ya bophelo ntweng."" This translates to: ""Allen utilized much of his experience in deep-sea operations and embarked on his journey to find Musashi with a hope for life's sake.""  The emphasis is on his prior experience being a key factor in starting the search.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kgahlego ya gawe ka go dira mmepe wa motheo wa lewatle (His skill in creating a seabed map):** While creating a map was important, the text doesn't explicitly state that this was the reason he *started* the search. It was a tool he used.
* **C: Peeletšo ya gagwe ya go nyakišiša ka lewatleng (His determination to rely on the ocean):**  The text doesn't describe this as a driving force.
* **D: Kgahlego ya gagwe ntweng (His skill on land):**  The text focuses on his deep-sea experience, not his skills on land.



Therefore, experience is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Go ya ka temana ye, Allen o dirišitše tšhelete ye ntši ya gagwe go eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go tsošološa Musashi** (To search for Musashi).

The passage states that Allen ""thoma leeto la gagwe la go hwetša Musashi ka poelo ya bophelo ntweng"" which translates to ""began his journey to find Musashi in the depths of the ocean.""  The entire context is about his search for the shipwreck. While the other options might be related to his efforts, the primary reason for his expenditure of funds is the search itself.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo go bonagalago e ile ya lebiša maemong a kotsi ka gare ga go dikologa sebjalo?","The correct answer is **A: Makhura a Uranium (Uranium Fission Products)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that ""Bamolao ba gononela gore se se laetša gore dikhafotine tšeo di tswerego makhura a uranium mo lefelong di ka ba dipharogile gomme di a dutla.""  This translates to ""Authorities believe that the products that result from uranium fission at the site may be mobile and remain.""

* Uranium fission products are the primary concern regarding long-term contamination after a nuclear incident. They are radioactive and can spread widely.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Radioactive caesium:** While radioactive caesium is a concern *after* a nuclear incident, the text focuses on the *initial* potential for contamination from uranium fission products.  It's a consequence, not the primary initial danger as implied in the question.
* **C: Muši o mošweu (The vapor/fumes):**  The text mentions vapor/fumes are a concern, but the core concern regarding the *long-term* danger mentioned is the fission products themselves.
* **D: Iodine:** Radioactive iodine is a concern for thyroid health, but not the primary issue of widespread environmental contamination from the incident.

Therefore, the text directly links the potential for persistent contamination to the fission products of uranium.



"
Ke fe ya tše di latelago yeo e sego ye nngwe ya dikeletšo tša polokego tšeo di šišintšwego badudi ba lefelong leo ka morago ga tiragalo ya polanteng?,"The correct answer is **A: G phema tšhomišo ya diyuniti tša go laola moya (Ventilate the air filtration system)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Balaodi ba selegae ba tsebiša badudi ka gare ga tikologo ya pholante go dula ka gae, go tima didirišwa tša go ntšha moya le go se nwe meetse a pompi.""  This directly mentions ventilating the air filtration system as a safety precaution.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Dula ka gare (Stay indoors):**  While staying indoors *might* be a precaution, the passage emphasizes *ventilation* as a specific safety measure.
* **C: Phema go hema muši o mošweu (Avoid eating fish):** The passage mentions fish containing caesium and iodine, but doesn't explicitly say avoiding eating fish is a primary safety measure.
* **D: Ithibele go nwa meetse a dimpoping (Avoid drinking well water):** The passage advises against drinking well water, however ventilation of the air filtration system is highlighted more directly as a safety precaution in this scenario.



Therefore, ventilating the air filtration system is the most directly and explicitly mentioned safety precaution related to the passage's content.



"
"Go ya ka Ngaka. Moll, ke eng seo se tshwenyago kudu ka XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Ke sekgahla se se phagamego sa mahu (It's a highly drug-resistant strain).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""papano ye ntswa e be e le """"""godimo kudu ka tsela yeo e tswenyago ebile e tšoša ka lebaka la palo ya go ba godimo ya mahu."""" (the strain was ""much more difficult to treat and kill due to a high number of drug resistance""). This directly points to the drug resistance being the major concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: diphapano di be gona ka gare bookelo (there were differences in the basement):** While differences exist in the basement, it's not the *primary* concern highlighted by Ngk. Moll.
* **B: Variant ya go ganetša diokobatši (A variant that resists drugs):** This is close, but ""drug resistance"" is more precise than ""variant that resists drugs.""  The text focuses on the *high level* of drug resistance.
* **C: Palo ya batho bao motho yo a fetetšwego a ka ba fetetšago (The number of people a treated person can infect):** While the potential for infection is a concern with any TB, the text emphasizes the *difficulty in treating* XDR-TB as the primary worry.



"
Ke balwetši ba bakae bao ba ilego ba hwetša konteraka ya mohuta wo mofsa bao ba tlišitšwego gore ke bašomi ba tlhokomelo ya maphelo?,"The correct answer is **A: 10**.

The text states: ""Nakong ya go lekana ngwaga, motho yo wa tswaeditšwego a ka tswaetša 10 go iša go 15 ya dikgokaganyi tša kgauswi. Le ge go le bjalo, diperesente tša XDR-TB sehlopeng ka moka sa batho ba go ba le tuberculosis di sa bonala di le fase; 6,000 ya palomoka ya batho ba 330,000 bo ba tswaeditšwego nakong yengwe le yengwe go la Afrika Borwa."" and ""Balwetši ba bangwe ba ka ba ba hweditše twatši ye bookelong, Ngk. Moll oa nagana, gomme bonnyane bja ba babedi e be e le bašomi a tša maphelo ba bookelo.""

This means that *two* people were found with XDR-TB in the waiting room, and that 10 of the deaths were among those in the waiting room. Therefore, the answer is 10."
Ke theknolotši ya mohuta mang yeo tshepedišo ya moloko o latelago e šomišago/,"The correct answer is **A: Theknolotši ye e theilwego godimo ga sathalaete (Satellite-based technology)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""It uses satellite-based technology to detect aircraft fumes from above and provide all pilots with accurate advisories.""
"
NextGen e hola bjang balaodi ba sephethephethe sa difofane ka go lebanya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditsela tše kopana tša go fofa (Emerging flight paths)**.

Here's why:

The text states that NextGen will allow planes to fly on ""emerging flight paths"" which will help reduce emissions and fuel consumption. This is the primary way NextGen will impact the flight paths of aircraft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mafelo a difofane a nepagetšego kudu (Aircraft were heavily outdated)** - The text doesn't mention outdated aircraft.
* **C: Go fokotšega ga go tšweletšwa ga carbon (Carbon reduction is being achieved)** - While carbon reduction is *a result* of NextGen, it's not *how* NextGen changes flight paths.
* **D: Makhura a fase (Lower fuel consumption)** - Similar to C, lower fuel consumption is a consequence of the new flight paths, not the primary way NextGen changes flight paths.



"
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke eng seo bora-histori ba sa kago ba sola FBI ka ge e lebišitšwe go sona?","The correct answer is **B: Go aba methopo go bosenyi bjo bo rarollwago ga bonolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the historical record shows the FBI was using old FBI tactics that were *not* suitable for easily solvable cases, particularly those involving missing persons. The passage further mentions that the FBI started to shift its approach in 2005 and now requires evidence supporting the connection of adults in missing persons cases.

Option B directly reflects this shift. The FBI *didn't* historically prioritize gathering evidence supporting adult connections in easy-to-solve cases, implying they were focusing on more complex and difficult cases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go godiša tekanyo ya bona ya katlego:** While the passage discusses changes in tactics, it doesn't specifically mention the FBI prioritizing increasing its success rate.
*   **C: Go tsepelela kudu melatong ya diswantšho tšeo di di laetšago bootswa:** The passage focuses on old tactics being *unsuitable* for certain cases, not on prioritizing newer evidence or methods.
*   **D: melato ya dikoloi tše di utswitšwego:** The passage specifically mentions *missing persons* cases, not car thefts.

Therefore, option B aligns best with the information provided in the historical record."
Boiteko bja go goboša bo gapeletša FBI go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Go tsepamiša kgopolo ya bosenyi bjo bo swanetšego go ba bonolo go bo rarolla.**

Here's why:

The text states the FBI started focusing on forensic science in 2005 to improve the ability to solve easily solvable crimes, specifically those involving fatalities.  The goal was to make forensic evidence more readily available and understandable for solving these cases. Option C directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Go aba methopo e oketšegilego dikoloi tše di utswitšwego** (Having specialized equipment for recovered vehicles): While potentially related to investigations, it's not the core focus of the FBI's forensic science initiative as described.
* **B: Go matlafatša lekala la tiragalo ya seemo sa katlego** (Improving the accuracy of voice identification):  This is a different area of forensic science than what the text emphasizes.
* **D: Go neela baemedi melatong ya diswantšho tše di laetšago bootswa** (Providing victims with information about the latest discoveries): While helpful for victims, it doesn't explain *what* the FBI started doing.



"
Go diregile eng ka koloi ya mollo yeo e arabilwego go thula ga JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **A: E ile ya thula** (It stayed).

The passage states: ""Mootledi wa sefofane o tsebišitšwe bjalo ka Moetapele Dilokrit Pattavee. Diphatlalatšo ya ditaba tša selegae di bega gore senamelwa sa moolo sa boemafofane se tokologile ge se bitšwa."" which translates to ""The pilot was briefed as Leader Dilokrit Pattavee. News reports indicated that the main engine of the aircraft was restored when called.""  This implies the engine was stationary or stopped. Therefore, the most logical answer is that it stayed (thula).

The other options don't fit the context. ""kgokologa"" (accelerate) and ""thuthupa"" (take off) are actions, while ""felelwa ke gase"" (was not reached) doesn't make sense in this context.
"
"Ka morago ga go thula sefofane sa JAS 39C Gripen, boemafofane bo ile bja tswalelwa go eng","The correct answer is **D: Baetapele ba Squadron (Squadron Leaders)**.

Here's why:

The text states the pilot was briefed *for flight operations*.  The question asks what the aircraft was then *briefed for*.  The most logical progression after a pilot briefing for flight operations is for the aircraft to be prepared for the squadron leaders. They would likely be the next ones to utilize the aircraft, perhaps for training or other operational purposes.

The other options are less likely:

*   **A: Difofane tša kgwebo? (Commercial aircraft?)** - Unrelated to the context.
*   **B: Dikoloi tša mollo (Police cars?)** - Completely irrelevant.
*   **C: Boraditaba ba selegae (News crews?)** - While media might be present, it's unlikely they would be the primary recipients of a post-flight briefing.



"
Brzezinsiki o ile a nea bomang tlhahlo nakong ya phetogelo ya Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The text states: ""Bjalo ka NSA, o thušitše Carter ka go swara ditaba tša lefase ka botseta..."" This directly indicates that Brzezinski assisted Carter during the Iranian Revolution.
"
Ke mang yo a swerego maemo a Moeletši wa Tšhireletšo ya Setšhaba go fihla ka 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The text states: ""a latela Henry Kissinger."" This directly indicates that Kissinger held the position of National Security Advisor (NSA) before Brzezinski.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa bontšhego gabotse bokamoso bja Bobek le Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **C: O kile a boutelwa bjalo ka sebapadi se sebotse kudu historing ya sehlopha.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states Bobek was honored as one of the greatest players in Partizan history.** This indicates a positive legacy, not a sign of weakness.
* **A: O ile a kgona go tsenya dino tša go feta tše 468 ge a be a ralokela sehlopha** - While impressive, the number of goals scored isn't necessarily a negative indicator of future potential.
* **B: O ile a kgona go tsenya dino tše dintši go feta sebapadi se sengwe le se sengwe** -  This is also a positive attribute and doesn't suggest weakness.
* **D: O ile a tšwelela dipapading tše dintši go feta sebapadi se sengwe** -  A long career can be positive, indicating durability and skill.

Therefore, being honored as a great player is the *opposite* of a sign of weakness in his legacy.  It suggests his impact was significant.



"
Ke polelo efe mabapi le histori ya Bobek le Parizan Belgrade yeo e lego ya therešo?,"The correct answer is **A: O thomile go ralokela Partizan ka 1945**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""O bile le bona ka 1945 gomme a dula go fihla ka 1958."" which translates to ""He joined in 1945 and stayed until 1958.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O ile a ralokela Zagreb pele ga Partizan Belgrade:** The text indicates he joined Partizan directly, not Zagreb first.
* **C: O ralokile Partizan go fihla ka 1995:** The text says he stayed until 1958, not 1995.
* **D: O ile a hwetša go tuma ka morago ga go boutelwa bjalo ka sebapadi se sebotse kudu sa Partizan:** While he was honored as a legend, the text states he gained fame *before* the 1995 recognition.



"
"O ile a hwetša go tuma go ya ka temana, ke seka sefe seo se fapantšhago Hesperonychus le Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **A: E na le maoto a mabedi (It has two feet)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Nonyane ya selabi ya go tlala ka mafofa, ya madi a go ruthela e dumetšwe go ba e sepela ka go ema ga maoto a mabedi a goba le manala a matelele bjalo ka Velociraptor."" (Its small, feathered legs, with blood-warming blood, were believed to allow it to stand on two feet with long legs like a Velociraptor.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E na le manala a bobedi a magolo (It has two large legs):**  While Hesperonychus *does* have two legs, the passage emphasizes that its legs are *not* as long as a Velociraptor's.  The key point is the two-legged stance.
* **C: E na le mmele wa mafofa ka botlalo (It has a completely feathered body):** The passage mentions ""nonyane ya selabi ya go tlala ka mafofa"" (small, feathered legs), but doesn't say the whole body is feathered.
* **D: Madi a yona a borutho (Its blood is warm):** This is mentioned, but not what differentiates it from a Velociraptor in the context of how it stood.



Therefore, the most significant difference highlighted in the passage and the best answer is that Hesperonychus stood on two feet.



"
Tlhalošo ya “Hesperonychus” e tšwa go dimelo dife tša mohuta mang ša mmele wa diphedi?,"The correct answer is **A: Manala**.

The text states: ""Nonyane ya selabi ya go tlala ka mafofa, ya madi a go ruthela e dumetšwe go ba e sepela ka go ema ga maoto a mabedi a goba le manala a matelele bjalo ka Velociraptor.""  This translates to: ""Its small, clawed feet, with sharp claws, were believed to allow it to walk on two legs with long claws like a Velociraptor.""

The passage specifically highlights the claws (manala) as a key characteristic used to compare *Hesperonychus* to a Velociraptor. Therefore, claws are the most relevant body part mentioned in relation to the species' characteristics.
"
Ke fe ya dipolelo tše di latelago mabapi le go thuntšhwa yeo e lego therešo?,"The correct answer is **D: Go thuntšhwa go diregile kua Buffalo.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Molekani wa mengwaga ye 30, wo a belegetšweng Buffalo, e be e le o mongwe wa ba bane ba go bolawa thuntšanong..."" (A 30-year veteran, living in Buffalo, was one of the four people shot in the shooting...)

This directly confirms that the shooting occurred in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monna le mosadi ka bobedi ba be ba etšwa Texas:** While the man and woman were *from* Texas, the passage doesn't explicitly state they were *shot* in Texas.
* **B: Go be go na le bahlaselwa ba bahlano:** The passage states ""ba bane"" (four people) were shot, not necessarily that there were four attackers.
* **C: Banyalani ba ile ba nyalana ngwaga pele ga moo kua Buffalo:** The passage states they were *meeting* in Buffalo, not that they were meeting there for the first time.



"
Ke polelo efe mabapi le tiragalo yeo go yona go thuntšhitšwego e le go ye nepagetšego?,"The correct answer is **A: E diregile monyanyeng wa segopotšo kua Buffalo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Molekani wa mengwaga ye 30, wo a belegetšweng Buffalo, e be e le o mongwe wa ba bane ba go bolawa thuntšanong..."" (A 30-year-old man, who had lived in Buffalo for many years, was one of the four people shot in the shooting...)

This directly indicates the shooting happened in Buffalo.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng sa mathomo gare ga bahlankedi mabapi le Luno?","The correct answer is **C: Go tšhologa ga makhura (The smell of decaying corpses)**.

The text states: ""Luno e be e na le 120-160 ya di cubic mita tša makhura mošamawatle ge e robega gomme madimo a godimo le maphoto a e kgoromeletša go ya ka meetseng. Dihilikhopta di phološitše maloko a sehlopa a lesomepedi gomme kgobadi ye tee fela e be e le go robega nko."" This translates to: ""Luno had 120-160 cubic meters of underwater decay when it became active and the surface and photos were taken from the sea. Helicopters spotted a group of fifty bodies and the only reason for the search was the smell of decay.""

The smell of decaying corpses was the reason the search party was deployed, and therefore the initial concern regarding Luno.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dipolelo tše di latelago mabapi le go thubega ga Luno yeo e sego ya nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Sekepe se ile sa kgorometšwa ka gare ga lefelo la go thuba maphoto.**

Here's why:

The passage states that helicopters photographed the wreckage going to the depths. It *doesn't* say the ship was photographed *inside* the camera's viewfinder. Options A, B, and C are not mentioned or implied in the text. Therefore, D is the only option that is explicitly *not* supported by the information given.
"
Ke ngwageng e lesome efe yeo Algeria e ilego ya hwetša tokologo?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960s**.

The text states: ""Ka bo 1960 o boetše morago go Algeria ye mfsa ya go ikemela go ya go ruta go laela difiliming."" This translates to: ""In 1960 he went to Algeria, which was gaining independence, to teach filmmaking.""  Therefore, Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.
"
Di sekerine tša thelebišene di be di sa hlongwa ka e bakeng sa moletlo wa poloko?,"The correct answer is **D: Kua St.Peter Square**.

The passage states: ""Disekerene tša telebišene tše dikgolo tše mmalwa di loketšwe mafelong a go fapafapana go la Rome go dumelela batho gore ba bogele moletlo.""  This translates to: ""Several large television screens were erected in different places in Rome to allow people to watch the event."" The event being referred to is the one at St. Peter's Square.



"
Moletlo wa poloko o be o swaretšwe kae?,"The correct answer is **C: Kua St.Peter Square**.

The text states: ""Disekerene tša telebišene tše dikgolo tše mmalwa di loketšwe mafelong a go fapafapana go la Rome go dumelela batho gore ba bogele moletlo ka St. Peter's Square.""  This clearly indicates the papal audience was held at St. Peter's Square.
"
"Ka morago ga go thuthupa, ke mang yo a ilego a alafša dikgobalo tše šoro?","The correct answer is **B: Ga go na motho**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Go be go se na motho ka gare ga moago."" which translates to ""There was no one inside the vault.""  Therefore, no one retrieved the bodies.
"
Ke mang yo a beilego go tšhologa ga gase?,"The correct answer is **A: Moagišane ka moagong (The driver of the taxi)**.

The text states: ""Mošomi wa khamphane ya dikgase o be a begela lefelong la kotsi ka morago ga gore moagišane a letša ka baka la kgase ya go dutla."" This translates to: ""The taxi company was warning of a dangerous spot after the driver stopped at a taxi rank."" 

Therefore, the driver of the taxi is the person who stopped at the taxi rank and was involved in the accident.
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke batho ba bakae bao ba hwilego tlhaselong yeo?","The correct answer is **C: 5**.

The text states: ""Dikgobalo tša letsogo le seledu ge Kristoffer Schneider a tlogelwa a nyaka setšeri ya go bopa sefahlego sa gagwe."" This means Kristoffer Schneider was injured *and* had his face rebuilt.  It also mentions Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback were involved.  Therefore, there are 5 people involved: Schneider, Alden, Cuddeback, and two other individuals whose names are not explicitly stated but are implied as being involved in the incident.
"
Ke sebetša sa mang se paletšwego ke go thunya ka nako ye nngwe nakong ya tlhaselo?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The passage states: ""Sebetša sa Uka se paletšwe mola se šupile hlogo ya monna wa bohlano."" which translates to ""Uka's work was carried out in such a way that the head of the man was removed.""
"
Ke efe ya di papadi tše di latelago yeo e ilego ya boutelwa go tšwa lenaneong la Diolimpiki?,"The correct answer is **B: Rugby**.

The passage states: ""International Olympic Committee e boutetše go akaretša dipapadi ka gare ga kopano ya yona ya maloko ka Berlin lehono. Rugby, kudu rugby union, le golf di kgethilwe godimo ga dipapadi tše dingwe tša go akanywa go tšeakarolo ka gare ga di Olympics.""

This directly indicates that rugby was included in the Olympics.  The other options (Squash, Baseball, and Karate) were considered but not included in the October meeting in Copenhagen.
"
Ke efe ya dipapadi tše di latelago yeo Komiti ya boditšhabatšhaba ya Diolimpiki e boutetšego go e akaretša dipapading?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokgahlo wa Rugby**.

The passage states: ""International Olympic Committee e boutetše go akaretša dipapadi ka gare ga kopano ya yona ya maloko ka Berlin lehono. Rugby, kudu rugby union, le golf di kgethilwe godimo ga dipapadi tše dingwe tše hlano tša go akanywa go tšeakarolo ka gare ga di Olympics.""

This directly translates to: ""The International Olympic Committee has decided to include sports in its family meeting in Berlin today. Rugby, mainly rugby union, and golf were chosen above other sports to be included as part of the Olympics.""

Therefore, Rugby (Mokgahlo wa Rugby) is one of the sports the IOC decided to include.
"
Arthur Guinness mathomong o ile a hira St James Gate Brewery mengwaga ye mekae?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The passage states: ""Ka morago ga mengwaga ye 250, Guinness e gotše go ya go ba kgwebo ya lefase..."" which translates to ""After 250 years, Guinness became a global business...""
"
Guinness e tliša mo e ka bago diranta tše dimilione tše dikete tše kae ngwaga o mongwe le o mongwe?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states that after 250 years, Guinness became a global company generating **10 billion euros** annually.
"
Ke dinageng tše kae tša European yeo twatši ya H5N1 e lemogilwego?,"The correct answer is **C: Šupa** (Farming/Poultry).

The passage states that the H5N1 bird flu outbreak was confirmed to have originated in a wetland area in **France**. It also mentions that France is the second most affected country in the EU after Austria, and then lists several other countries.  The context clearly indicates the outbreak occurred in poultry farms.

Therefore, ""Šupa"" (farming/poultry) is the most accurate answer.
"
Taba ya moragorago ya twatš i ya H5N1 e lemogilwe kae?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The text states: ""Kgathelelo ya mpšhikela wo kotsi go batho, H5N1, e netefaleditšwe go ba e tswaditše lephediphedi la naga leo le hwilego, le hweditšwe ka Mošupulogo, marshland kgauswi le Lyon go la bohlabela bja France.""  This directly translates to ""The risk of the dangerous avian flu, H5N1, has been confirmed to have originated from a wetland found near Lyon in northern France.""

Haiti e bile neng le mafelelo le bolwetši bjo pele ga go phatlalala mo go bakilwego ke bašireletši ba khutšo?,"The correct answer is **B: Kapejana pele ga go fihla ga madira**.

The text states: ""Pele ga go fihla ga madira, Haiti e be e sa ka ya kopana le mathata a go amana le kokwanahloka go tloga ka bo 1800."" (Before the arrival of the troops, Haiti was unable to cope with sanitation problems dating back to the 1800s.)
"
Ditlakala tšeo di tšwago lefelong lefe la tšeo di bilego le seabe go phatlalaleng ga bolwetši?,"The correct answer is **B: Go kampa ga UN**.

Here's why:

* The text states the UN peacekeeping camp in Haiti is suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
* The text mentions that the UN's presence in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake is linked to the spread of the disease.
*  While the Artibonite River is mentioned as a potential pathway for bacteria, the UN camp is identified as the likely origin.
* The Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy is mentioned as having conducted studies *into* the outbreak, not as a source *of* it.
* The 2010 earthquake created the conditions for the UN to be in Haiti, but it is the UN camp's actions that are directly implicated.



"
Mmušo wa Irish o rulaganya go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go abela basenyi diokobatši - go dikahlolo** (To provide citizens with options - solutions).

Here's why:

The text states the Irish government is taking action to address the rapid rise in drug use.  It's focusing on two things:

1. **Addressing the root causes:**  ""Go tšwa bobedi go tšwa thebelelong ya tša maphelo a setšhaba..."" (Addressing the root cause from the perspective of public health...). This implies preventative measures and helping people avoid drug use.
2. **Providing alternatives:** ""...le dikotlo tša go amana le diokobatši tšeo di fiwago go tloga mola diphetogo tša go se ba molaong di dirwago."" (...and measures to deal with drug users starting from the point of legal changes being made.). This suggests providing support and pathways to recovery for those already struggling with addiction.

Option A, ""Go abela basenyi diokobatši - go dikahlolo"" best reflects this dual approach of both prevention and providing solutions/options for those affected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go bea melao e boima kudu mabapi le go dumelelwa ga diokobatši** (To implement very strict laws regarding the legalization of drugs): The text doesn't mention legalization. It's about addressing existing drug use.
* **C: Go bea melao ya iketla ka ga go dumelelwa ga diokobatši** (To implement laws to prevent the legalization of drugs): This is related to option B, and the text doesn't focus on preventing legalization.
* **D: Go se be bosenyi bja diokobatši** (To not be a drug user):  This is a personal choice and not a government action.



"
Ke eng seo se le molaong ga nakwana kua Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Diokobatši (Immigration)**.

The text states: ""...Tona ya tša Maphelo o tšweleditše ngongorego bobedi bakeng sa maphelo a batho bao ba tšeago monyetla wa tumelelo ya molao ya nakwana ya diokobatši tšeo di amegago...""  This directly translates to ""...The Department of Justice has developed two pathways for people seeking legal immigration permission...""

Therefore, the text is discussing legal immigration in Ireland.
"
Mosenyi yo a gononwago gore a nyakišišwa ka eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsena ka ntle ga molao** (Entering unlawfully).

The text explicitly states: ""Christopher Garcia, seboleledi sa Kgoro ya Maphodisa ya Los Angeles, se boletše gore se gononela gore mosenyi wa monna o nyakišišwa ka lebaka la go tsenela e sego go thuba."" This translates to ""Christopher Garcia, the Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, said he suspected the man was arrested for unlawful entry.""
"
"Ge o fetošwa leswao, ke eng seo mogononelwa a sa se dirago?","The correct answer is **D: Go diriša di-tarpaulin go e fetoša**.

The text states: ""Kaofatšo e be e dirilwe ka go šomiša tarpaulins ye ntso ya go kgabiswa ka maswa oa khutšo le pelo go kupetša """"""O"""""""" go balega ka hlaka ya fase """"""e""""""""."" This translates to: ""The wreckage was recovered using tarpaulins which were used to cover the body and a heart to vomit """"""O"""""""" carefully at the bottom.""""""

Therefore, the body was covered with tarpaulins. Option D accurately reflects this action.
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo mohlahli wa Seisemane Karno a sa kago a latofatšwa ka sona?","The correct answer is **A: Hlolo ya tokelo ya ngwalolla (Academic integrity)**.

Here's why:

The passage details several instances of Karno violating school rules:

*   Giving out large grades without permission.
*   Using inappropriate language (swearing) towards students.
*   Using a cellphone during lessons.
*   Creating a romantic relationship with a student.

While he did violate student relations (B) and used inappropriate language (D), the passage strongly implies that violating academic integrity is the core reason for his dismissal. He was caught using a cellphone during lessons, which is a clear violation of academic integrity as it suggests cheating or being distracted from learning. The other options, while incidents, are presented as supporting details for the main reason for his removal. C is also true, however, the primary reason for his removal is his violation of academic integrity.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo a sa kago a thopša ke Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **D: Batšeadiswantšho**.

The text states: ""Bathopšwa ba tshelelago, go akaretša bana le batšofe, ba lokolotšwe ka pela, ka ge go be go na le batšeadiswantšho ba Filipino."" This translates to: ""The hostages, including children and elderly, were released first, in the presence of Filipino maids.""  This clearly indicates the maids were present and therefore likely witnessed the events, making them someone who might not want to be associated with Mendoza.
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke batho bafe bao ba thopilwego bao ba sa tiišetšwago gore ba lokollwa ka pela?","The correct answer is **C: Batšeadiswantšho**.

The passage states: ""Bathopšwa ba tshelelago, go akaretša bana le batšofe, ba lokolotšwe ka pela, **ka ge go be go na le batšeadiswantšho ba Filipino.**""  This indicates that Filipino maids were not evacuated first.
"
"Go ya ka temana ye, ke mang yo a kgoboketšago mesaeno ya go thekga go dira gore lenyalo la bong bjo bo swanago bo be malaong kua Brazil","The correct answer is **C: Kereke ya Roman Catholic**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Kereke ya Roman Catholic e tšwetšepele ka go ganetša gore go nyalana ga batho ba bong bo tee go be molaong ka nageng."" (The Roman Catholic Church played a role in establishing the legality of same-sex marriage in the country.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baipeletši:** (Advertiser) - Not mentioned in the text.
* **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is mentioned as someone who might challenge the law, not someone who is advocating for it.
* **D: Marta go aba dilo:** (Marta Suplicy) - While she drafted the law, the text attributes the Church's role to *establishing* its legality, making the Church the primary actor in this context.



"
Baipelaetši ba tla fa bomang kgopelo ya bona?,"The correct answer is **A: Kereke ya Roman Catholic**.

The text states: ""Bagwanti ba holofela go kgoboketša kgopelo ya mesaeno ye dimilion tše 1.2 go e tliša pele ga Lekgotla la Naga ka November.""  The text goes on to explain that the law was written by the mayor of São Paulo, but the focus of the entire passage is on the Catholic Church's efforts to gather signatures to challenge the law. Therefore, the Church is the one attempting to gather the petition.
"
"Go ya ka pego ya Armand Versace, ke eng seo se diregilego ka go lebanya pele ga ge lešaba le thoma go arabela boemong bja leratadima?","The correct answer is **A: E ile ya thoma go na ka sefako**.

Here's why:

Armand states: ""ka morago gwa wa sefako go tšwa lefaufaung..."" which translates to ""after the rain started, a flash flood..."" This indicates the flash flood (sefako) happened *before* the danger became apparent and people started fleeing. The other options are not directly supported by the text as the immediate preceding event to the danger.
"
"Go ya ka Versace, diphefo tše maatla kudu di thomile neng?","The correct answer is **A: Metsotso e sego kae ka morago ga ge ponagatšo e thomile.**

The text states: ""Metsotso e mehlano ka morago ga ponagatšo moya o ile wa thoma go tsena..."" which translates to ""Five minutes after the explosion, the air started to enter..."". This indicates that the powerful effects began very shortly after the explosion. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the text links the strong winds to the explosion itself, not to events that happened later.
"
"Pele ga Fred, ke madimo a ma kae a magolo ao a begilwego ka bohlabela bja 35°W?","The correct answer is **A: Ga go selo** (There was nothing).

The passage states: ""Fred ke ledimo le legolo la matlakadibe leo le ilego la gatišwa go fihla ga bjale go borwa le bohlaba bja Atlantic go tloga mathomong a sathalaete ya diswantšho..."" which translates to ""Fred is a large storm system that was tracked to now be in the North Atlantic from the initial position of the radar displays..."". This implies that Fred is the first significant storm mentioned in the context of being tracked from that location. The question asks what other large storms were initially tracked from that location *before* Fred. The answer is that there were none.



"
"Ge Fred a be a le kgauswi le dihlakahlaka tša Cape Verde, e be e lebile ka lehlakoreng lefe?","The correct answer is **A: Bodikela**.

The passage states: ""Ledimo, la goba di mille tše e ka bago tše 645 (1040 km) bodikela bja dihlakahlaka tša Cape Verde..."" which translates to ""The cloud, which is about 645 (1040 km) away from the Cape Verde islands, is heading towards the wreckage...""

Therefore, Fred was heading **south** when it was near the Cape Verde islands.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e nago le lebelo le legolo go feta tšeo di tlilego pele ga yona?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The question states that 802.11n offers a data rate of 600Mbit/s, which is significantly higher than the older standards like 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. Therefore, 802.11n has the highest data rate among the options provided.
"
Ke eng seo se nyakegago gore 802.11n e sepelelane le 802.11b ka morago?,"The correct answer is **D: Diradio tše pedi (Both radios)**.

Here's why:

* **Backward Compatibility:** 802.11n is designed to be backward compatible with older standards like 802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g. This means an 802.11n device can communicate with devices using those older standards.
* **How it works:** To achieve backward compatibility, 802.11n devices often include radios that can operate on the frequencies used by the older standards (typically 2.4 GHz). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lebelo le legolo kudu (Larger range):** While 802.11n *can* offer a larger range in some scenarios, it's not the primary requirement for backward compatibility.
* **B: Bokgoni bja 802.11b go šoma ka 5.0Ghz (The ability of 802.11b to operate on 5.0Ghz):**  802.11b is a 2.4 GHz standard and *cannot* operate on 5.0 GHz.
* **C: Go ralala le 600Mbit/s (Achieving 600Mbit/s):** The 600Mbit/s speed is a feature of 802.11n, but not a requirement for backward compatibility. A device can be backward compatible without using the full 802.11n speed.



Therefore, the presence of both the 2.4 GHz radio (for compatibility with 802.11b) *and* often the 5 GHz radio (for 802.11a and 802.11n) is what enables 802.11n to work with older standards."
Ke ditiragalo tše kae tšeo mofenyi wa sefoka sa medale wa gauta sa di Olympic a bego a swanetše go rutha ka gare dipapading tša commonwealth?,"The correct answer is **B: Tharo**.

The question states he won gold medals in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games. Therefore, he competed in a total of three events.
"
Ke ka lebaka la eng mofenyi wa sefoka sa medale wa gauta sa Diolimpiki a be a sa nwe dihlare bakeng sa bohloko bja gagwe?,"The correct answer is **D: Ga se ya dumelelwa dipapading tša Commonwealth**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O be a sa kgone go tšea dipilise tšeo di hlokegago go fenya bohloko bja gagwe ka ge di be di ganetšwa go tšwa Dipapading."" This directly translates to ""He was unable to get the medication he needed to treat his condition because it was not permitted by the Commonwealth Games.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O be a sena bohloko le ge e le bofe** (He had a condition, whatever it was): While true, the passage doesn't specify what the condition was, only that it affected his body.
*   **B: Eile ya mo dira gore a ikwe a lwala** (It made him get sick): The passage says his condition *affected* his body, not that it caused him to get sick.
*   **C: O be a tshwenyegile gore e tla ama gampe mmele wa gagwe** (He was worried it would damage his body): The passage doesn't mention worry, but rather the lack of permitted medication.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se bego se ka lebiša kgakanego mabapi le modiro wa tšhišinyego ya lefase?","The correct answer is **A: Go ba gona ga maru a leswiswi (The presence of swarms)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Maru a maso a go se amane le tiragalo ya volcano a begilwe morumong wa thaba. Maru a tlišitše kgonagalo ya go se kwešiši ge e ba thakgolo ya nnete e diregile."" This translates to: ""The seismic activity was preceded by a swarm of earthquakes. The swarm increased the suspicion that a real event was occurring.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Dipego tše di tšwago Kantorong ya Icelandic Meteorological (Data from the Icelandic Meteorological Office):**  While the Icelandic Meteorological Office recorded the earthquakes, the *presence of the swarm* is what was directly observed and caused concern. The data *from* the office is a consequence of the swarm, not the cause of the concern.
* **C: Mmepe wa ditšhaba-tšhaba wa tšhišinyego ya lefase (Global seismic map):** The global map is a general reference, but the text focuses on the specific events happening in Iceland.
* **D: Mošomo wo o beilwego mafelong a mangwe a Iceland (Work done in other parts of Iceland):**  The text specifically mentions the volcano's summit caldera and doesn't discuss work in other parts of Iceland.

Therefore, the presence of the seismic swarm is the most directly linked factor that increased suspicion about an impending volcanic event.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke phetogo ya kgato yeo e diregilego neng?","The correct answer is **D: Bekeng ya pele ga moo**.

The text states: ""Mmepe wa tšitšinyego ya lefase wa ditšhatšhaba wa United States Geological Survey o bontšitše gore ga go ditšitšinyego tša lefase go la Iceland **beke pele ga moo**."" (The USGS global seismic map showed that there were earthquakes in Iceland **a week before** this.)
"
Ke efe ya dipolelo tše di latelago mabapi le sedirišwa sa go nyakišiša ngwedi sa Chandrayaan-1 seo e sego therešo?,"The correct answer is **C: Go tlošwa ga probe go ile gwa atlega (The probe failed to detach)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) was *launched* and successfully reached a specific altitude above the lunar surface. However, it also implies the mission had issues, stating that it ""ema ka katlego kgauswi le pala ya borwa bja Ngwedi"" which suggests it didn't perform *perfectly* as planned. The question asks about what *didn't happen* as described in the passage.  The fact that the probe *didn't detach* is a likely point of failure that would hinder the mission's objectives.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Sekepe sa go dikologa seo se ilego sa thoma sedirišwa sa go nyakišiša se be se na le sehlopha sa bašomi (The separation mechanism that initiated the lunar mission had a team of ten):** The passage doesn't mention anything about a team of ten involved in the separation mechanism.
*   **B: Probe e be e na le diletšo tše bohlokwa (The probe had important instruments):** The passage explicitly states that the probe had three crucial instruments.
*   **D: Probe e be e pentilwe ka mahlakoreng (The probe was painted in layers):**  While the passage mentions lunar analysis, it does not include any information about the probe being painted in layers.



"
Ke efe ya dipolelo tše di latelago yeo e hlalošago ka nepe sedirišwa sa go nyakišiša ngwedi?,"The correct answer is **A: E ile ya kotama kgauswi le pole ya leboa la Ngwedi** (It crashed against the south pole of the Moon).

The passage states: ""goma wa ema ka katlego kgauswi le pala ya borwa bja Ngwedi"" which translates to ""it finally crashed against the south pole of the Moon.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke tekanyo efe ya tšhireletšo kgahlanong le bolwetši yeo e tlago phethagatšwa la mafelelo?","The correct answer is **B: Baswari ba dikolobe (Insecticides)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Phulego e šušumeditše mmušo wa India go tšea dikgatho tše bjalo ka go romela batho ba go tanya dikolobe mafelong ao a amegilego kudu..."" This translates to ""The plague alarmed the Indian government to seek solutions by sending people to investigate the areas where the insects were prevalent..."" The text then continues to mention spraying insecticides. Therefore, the government is taking measures to control the insect population with insecticides.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pesticides:** While insecticides *are* a type of pesticide, ""Baswari ba dikolobe"" (insecticides) is a more specific and accurate answer based on the context.
*   **C: Meento ya Encephalitis (Encephalitis vaccines):** The passage mentions the government providing vaccines *after* the plague and as a preventative measure for the following year. It's not the primary immediate response.
*   **D: Dikgaretene tša menang (Plague quarantine):** Quarantine is mentioned as a measure, but the immediate action taken to control the insects is spraying insecticides.



"
Bolwetši bo fetišetšwa bjang bathong?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikolobe (Mosquitoes)**.

The text states: ""Bolwetši bo rwalwa ke dikolobe, bjoo ka morago bo yago bathong ka menang."" This translates to: ""The disease is caused by mosquitoes, which then infect people through the bite.""
"
Go palelwa ga dipolelo tša bobedi go ka lebiša go ditlamorago dife?,"The correct answer is **B: Tokelo ya bokamoso ya mekgahlo ya setšhaba ya bong bjo bo swanago (Future right of national assemblies of similar origin)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the reconsideration of the law could potentially open the door for future national assemblies of similar origin to form partnerships. This directly relates to the future rights of such assemblies.
* Option A (Tlhahlobo ya ka pela ya HJR-3 - Preliminary review of HJR-3) is a preparatory step, not a consequence of the reconsideration.
* Option C (kopano ya tšhoganetšo ya go dira melao - merger of legislative bodies) isn't directly mentioned or implied by the text.
* Option D (Go thibelwa ga mekgahlo ya setšhaba ya bong bjo bo swanago - Prevention of national assemblies of similar origin) is the opposite of what the text suggests.

Therefore, the reconsideration of the law primarily impacts the *future rights* of national assemblies of similar origin to form partnerships.
"
"Go ya ka temana, polelo ya bobedi e phumotšwe neng?","The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya kopano ya go dira melao**.

The text states: ""Phetogo e dirilwe go lenaneo la lekgotlatheramelao ge kahlolo ya bobedi e phumulwa pele ke Ntlo ya Baemedi gomme ya fetišwa ka mokgwa wa go swana ke Ntlo ya Mošupulogo.""  This translates to ""The change was made through a legislative process when the second resolution was passed first by the House of Representatives and subsequently approved similarly by the House of Parliament."" This indicates the resolution was passed during a legislative session (kopano ya go dira melao).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka 2011:** While the text mentions the change happened ""after 2011,"" it doesn't specify the exact year the *resolution* was passed.
*   **C: Ka Mošupologo:** The House of Parliament approved it, but the *passing* of the resolution happened during the legislative process.
*   **D: Ka 2015:**  HJR-3 is expected to be considered by a new legislature in 2015-2016, not when the initial resolution was passed.

"
Go bomang “Dipampiri tša Panama di ile tša dutlela gona”?,"The correct answer is **A: Femeng ya Mossack Fonseca**.

The text states: """"""Dipampiri tša Panama” ke lentšu la ditokomane tše dimilione tše lesome go tšwa femeng ya molao ya Panama Mossack Fonseca...""""""  This directly answers the question of where the Panama Papers originated.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo boraditaba ba British ba bego ba bolela gore o laola bontši bja dikhamphani tše di bego di šomišwa go uta lehumo?","The correct answer is **C: Panka ya Deutsche**.

The text states: ""Kuranta ya Britain The Guardian e bolela gore Panka ya Deutscche e laotše boraro bja dikhampane tša shell tše 1200 tšeo di šomišitšwego go fihlelela se."" which translates to ""The British newspaper The Guardian reported that Deutsche Bank had found three-quarters of the 1200 shell companies used in this.""
"
Ke dikotsi dife tša difofane tše di latelago tšeo di ilego tša bolawa kudu?,"The correct answer is **A: Sefofane sa go thula tseleng ya sona ya Armenia go tšwa Iran.**

The text explicitly states: ""Kgweledi yona yeo e bone sesofane se sengwe se putla tseleng ya difofane go la Mashhad gomme ya sa thula lebotho, se bolaya ba lesomešupa."" This translates to: ""That week saw another plane crash en route to Mashhad, without landing and killing 112 people.""

Option A accurately reflects this event.  While the other options mention crashes, they don't specifically name the deadliest one, which was the plane crashing en route to Armenia.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sego lebaka la dikotsi tše dintši tša difofane tšeo di diregago kua Iran?,"The correct answer is **B: Go hloka tekanyetšo yeo e dumelelago go reka difofane tše mpsha (Lack of regulation allowing the purchase of used vehicles)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the dangers are linked to **used vehicles** being imported and not meeting safety standards. The lack of regulation regarding the purchase of these used vehicles is a direct cause of the problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sehlopha sa kgale sa difofane tša setšhaba le tša sešole (An old fleet of public and school vehicles):** While the fleet might be old, the text emphasizes the *importation* of unsafe *used* vehicles as the main problem.  The age of the fleet alone doesn't explain the recent increase in accidents.
* **C: Dikiletšo tšeo di thibelago go reka difofane tše mpsha (Warning signs prohibiting the purchase of used vehicles):** There's no mention of warning signs. The problem is the *lack of regulation* *allowing* the purchase, not signs *prohibiting* it.
* **D: Sehlopha sa difofane seo se sa hlokomelwego gabotse (A poorly maintained fleet of vehicles):** While maintenance *could* be a factor, the text focuses on the inherent safety issues with the *vehicles themselves* (being used and unsafe). The text doesn't directly point to poor maintenance as the primary cause.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa akaretšwago pegong yeo e tšwago go Sehlopha sa Thuto sa Iraq?,"The correct answer is **A: Go swaya diphošo ga pholisi ya bjale (To manage current policies)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions the need for a new prime minister to ensure Iraq's security and establish a secure environment. This directly relates to **managing current policies** and addressing security concerns.
* The passage mentions the US stance on the law to lead the Middle East but doesn't detail policy management.
* While the passage mentions potential impacts on corruption, the economy, and the model related to the crisis, it doesn't specifically address **managing current policies** related to those issues.
* The passage does mention a US stance, which is **C: Ditšhišinyo tva go šireletša mellwane ya Iraq (Efforts to protect Iraq's neighbors)**.

Therefore, option A is the one *not* explicitly mentioned in the provided text.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sa kago ya tlhohleletšwa ke Sehlopha sa Thuto sa Iraq pegong ya sona?,"The correct answer is **D: Go hlongwa ga maitapišo a mafsa a bo-diplomate (The breaking of diplomatic norms)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the report focuses on the lack of certainty about the quality of governance, the growing economic crisis, and the threat from terrorism.
* It mentions a belief in the necessity of a new Iraqi constitution to secure Iraq's borders and build a secure environment.
* The report advocates for the early appointment of a president to protect Iraq from threats and establish a secure environment.
*  Therefore, the report is *not* advocating for the breaking of diplomatic norms. In fact, it's implicitly advocating for the *establishment* of a more stable environment, which would likely *require* adherence to diplomatic norms.

Let's look at why the other options *are* addressed:

* **A: Seo ke tiišetšo ya go emiša dikgaruru tše di golago di tsebišitšwego (The assurance of halting large-scale established terrorism):** This is directly addressed, as terrorism is cited as a major threat.
* **B: Phetogo ya pejana ya tsela (The previous road change):** This is not directly mentioned, but the call for a new constitution *implies* a need for change from the previous system.
* **C: Tšhomišo ya ngangišano yeo e bulegilego (The establishment of open negotiations):**  The report advocates for a new constitution, which is a form of negotiation, and it also references the opening of negotiations.



"
"Go ya ka maphodisa, ke mang yo a bego a lebelelwa e le monna wa letsogo le letona la Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Maphodisa a rile Lo Piccolo o be a na le letsogo la godimo ka lebaka la gore o be a bone monna wa go šika-twii le Provenzano go la Palermo..."" which translates to ""The informants called Lo Piccolo had a high reputation because he saw a man who was a right-hand man to Provenzano in Palermo...""

The passage also mentions Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino were targets of the Mafia, but they were not seen as Provenzano's right-hand man.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimošo yeo e filwego mo temaneng, seo se hlodilego lehu la Falcone e be e le eng?","The correct answer is **A: O ile a bolawa nakong ya ntwa yeo e bego e laolwa ke Riina**.

The text states: ""Balaodi ba ba tlišitšwe ke Provenzano ge a be afediša ntwa ya go huwetšwa ke Riina kgahlanong le mmušo yeo e tšerego maphelo a Mafia crusaders Giovanni Falcone e Paolo Borsellino ka 1992.""  This translates to ""The betrayal was orchestrated by Provenzano when he offered the bounty for the assassination of Riina in connection with the anti-Mafia crusade that claimed the lives of Mafia crusaders Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992."" Therefore, Falcone was killed during the bounty placed on Riina's head.
"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e sego e nngwe ya ditheto tša Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **B: Modulasetulo wa komiti bakeng sa bohle ba Japan Judo Federation**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Le go ba nkgwete ya pele ya Olympic le Lefase, Saito e be e le modulasetulo ya komiti ya thutišo ya All Japan Federation ka nako ya lehu la gagwe."" This translates to: ""Being a pioneer in the Olympics and World Championships, Saito was the chairman of the committee of the All Japan Federation during his illness.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mofenyi wa lefase makaga a mabedi** - The text mentions he was a pioneer in Olympics and World Championships, not a two-time world champion.
*   **C: Mofenyi wa sefoka sa gauta sa Diolimpiki ka makga a mabedi** - The text says he was a pioneer in the Olympics and World Championships, not a two-time Olympic gold medalist.
*   **D: Setsebi sa Judo** - The text states he was a judoka (judoka), but it doesn't specify that he was a professional athlete. It implies a high level of expertise, but ""setsebi"" (professional athlete) isn't directly mentioned.

Therefore, the most accurate statement that isn't explicitly contradicted by the text is that he was the chairman of the All Japan Federation committee.



"
Naa lwasaki o kgonne kae go efoga go dira dikano?,"The correct answer is **A: Japan**.

The passage states that Iwasaki was taken to Japan to receive medical treatment.

Ke mang a hlasetšego lwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Mpša**.

The passage states: ""Iwasaki o hlakoditšwe ke mahodu a merwalo ya dikepe, a hlaselwa go la Tibet ke **mpša ye šoro**, gomme a swarwa ka India."" 

This translates to: ""Iwasaki was wrecked by shipwrecks, attacked on the way to Tibet by a **pirate ship**, and rescued in India.""
"
Alonso o ile a fediša neng lebelo la gagwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka morago ga gore Schumacher a fediše lebelo la gagwe ka noši**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher o feditše lebelo la gagwe moragonyana ga Alonso..."" which directly translates to ""Michael Schumacher finished his stint shortly after Alonso...""  This implies Alonso finished his stint *before* Schumacher did. The question asks *when* Alonso finished his stint, and the text specifies it was after Schumacher's stint ended.  Therefore, option C accurately reflects this sequence of events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka morago ga gore Schumacher a senye leotwana la gagwe la ka pele** - This is incorrect. The text says Schumacher finished *shortly after* Alonso, not *after* he had a first stint.
* **B: Fisichella o ile a lahlegelwa ke taolo ya koloi ya gagwe** -  While the first sentence mentions Fisichella being pulled in by the pit crew, it doesn't connect that to Alonso's stint ending.
* **D: Pele e etelela pele** - This is incorrect. The text clearly states Alonso finished *after* Fisichella was pulled in.



"
Ke eng seo se dirilego gore Schumacher gore a fediše lebelo la gagwe ka pela?,"The correct answer is **D: Tshenyo ya go emišwa ga koloi (A penalty for a pit stop violation)**.

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher o feditše lebelo la gagwe moragonyana ga Alonso, ka lebaka la tshenyo ya go fegwa dintweng tše dintši lebelong."" This translates to ""Michael Schumacher lost his position shortly after Alonso, due to a penalty for a pit stop violation.""
"
"Go ya ka temana yeo, ke mošomo wa mang wa go beya beile ya bao ba swerwego?","The correct answer is **D: Mokhomišenare wa kgorotsheko (Recruitment Commissioner)**.

The text states: ""Mokomišina o bea baile, ge eba e ya dumelelwa, gomme a dira ditatofatšo tšeo dtlišitšwego ke lephodisa leo le tswerego gore di be semmušo."" This translates to ""The Commissioner sets up a job, if approved, and makes the assessments generated by the forensic scientist to determine if they were legitimate.""  Therefore, the Recruitment Commissioner is responsible for setting up the jobs and making the assessments.
"
"Go ya ka taelo ya go thibela ya nakwana yeo e boletšwego temaneng, ke eng seo bao ba swerwego ba swanetšego go dumelelwa go ba le sona gore ba kgone go swarwa nako ye telele go feta diiri tše 24?","The correct answer is **A: Beile (Admitted)**.

Here's why:

The text states that a ""mokomišina o bea baile, ge eba e ya dumelelwa"" - meaning an admission is granted, if approved. This is the key to being able to be held for longer than 24 hours. The admission process allows for further investigation and detention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kopano le mohlankedi yo a swarago (Contact with a legal representative):**  While contact with a lawyer is important, it doesn't automatically grant permission to be held longer than 24 hours.
*   **C: Ditatofatšo tša semmušo tšeo di ntšhitšwego ke Moahlodi Glynn (Official investigations conducted by Investigator Glynn):**  Investigations are part of the process, but the permission to hold someone longer than 24 hours hinges on the admission.
*   **D: Theeletšo (Evidence):** Evidence is gathered after the admission. It's not the reason for being able to be held longer.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lebaka lefe leo le sa somišwago go hlalosa go khanselwa ga dikgetho?","The correct answer is **B: Di be di le kgahlanong le molaotheo** (They were in conflict with the law).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Se se ganetša dipego tša peleng, tšeo di rilego go phumula dikgetho go be go tlo ba kgahlanong le molaotheo."" (This rejects the claims of the US, which say that withdrawing troops would be in conflict with the law.)

The other options are not supported by the text:

* **A: Go be go na le dikotsi tša polokego** (There were security risks): While security is mentioned as a *reason* for the withdrawal, the passage highlights the conflict with Afghan law as a key argument *against* the withdrawal.
* **C: Ditshenyegelo tša godimo** (Higher-ups' concerns): The text doesn't mention higher-ups' concerns.
* **D: Go se kwagale ga molaotheo** (There was no law): The passage clearly states that the issue *is* the conflict with the law.



"
Ke ka lebaka la eng mafelelong balaodi ba ile ba bona dikgetho di sa hlokagale?,"The correct answer is **A: Di be di le kgahlanong le molaotheo** (They were in violation of the law).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batseta ba boletše gore ba hweditše phapano yeo e lekanego molaotheong wa Afghan go bona kelelo go sa hlokagale."" (Investigators said they found a discrepancy with Afghan law to see the reason for the seizure.) and ""Se se ganetša dipego tša peleng, tšeo di rilego go phumula dikgetho go be go tlo ba kgahlanong le molaotheo."" (This rejects claims from the past, which said that seizing goods would be in violation of the law.)

This clearly indicates that the goods were seized because they violated Afghan law. The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
Ke mang yo a fanago ka ditirelo tša semolao go FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Baemedi ba dipolotiki**.

The text states: ""Mopresedente wa Pakistani o kgethile ""Baemedi ba Dipolotiki"" go buša FATA, yeo e laetšago taolo ya go nyaka e ikeme mafelong ao. Baemedi ba ba na le maikarabelo a go abela ditirelo tša mmušo le molao ka fase ga Sengwalo 247 sa Molaotheo wa Pakistani.""

This translates to: ""The President of Pakistan appointed the ""Political Agents"" to govern FATA, which seeks self-rule in those areas. The Agents have the authority to provide government and legal services under Section 247 of the Pakistan Constitution.""

Therefore, the Political Agents (Baemedi ba Dipolotiki) are the ones responsible for providing government and legal services.
"
Ke mantšu afe go ao a latelago a mabapi le “Bahlankedi ba Dipolotiki” ba FATA ao e sego nnete?,"The correct answer is **D: Ba na le taolo ye e feleletšego dikarolong tše itšego** (They have exclusive control over the respective areas).

Here's why:

The text states that the Political Agents were appointed by the Pakistani President to administer FATA, specifically to obtain the desired autonomy.  The text also says they are entrusted with providing government and legal services under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution. 

However, the text *doesn't* say they have *exclusive* control.  The implication is they are providing services *under* Pakistani law and *in support of* FATA's autonomy, not ruling with absolute, exclusive power.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Ba fana ka ditirelo tša semolao** (They provide legal services):  The text explicitly states they are entrusted with providing legal services.
* **B: Ba kgethilwe ke mopresidente wa Pakistani** (They were appointed by the Pakistani President): The text clearly states this.
* **C: Ba latela molaotheo wa Pakistan** (They follow Pakistani law): The text mentions they operate under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution.



Therefore, the only inaccurate statement is that they have exclusive control.



"
Ke sefoka sefe seo Emma Stone e bego e le nkgetheng go sona?,"The correct answer is **C: Modiragatši yo Mokaonekaone wa Mosadi**.

The text states: ""Gosling le Stone ba amogetše go kgethwa ba Moraloki wa monna le wa mosadi, ka go latelana."" This translates to ""Gosling and Stone received nominations for Best Actor and Best Actress, respectively.""
"
Ke sefoka sefe seo mmubi o sego wa ba nkgetheng go sona?,"The correct answer is **A: Diswantšho tše Kaonekaone**.

The text states that ""Diswantšho tše Kaonekaone"" (which translates to ""Original Songs"") *did not* receive any nominations.  The question asks what wasn't nominated, and option A is the only one that reflects this.
"
Ke dilo dife go tše tšeo di ilego tša tšwela pele di šoma ka morago ga tšhišinyego ya lefase?,"The correct answer is **C: Ditirelo ka moka tša ditimela** (Railway services).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tirelo ya ditimela e šitišitšwe mafelong ao a amegago..."" which translates to ""Railway services were disrupted in the affected areas...""
* Option A (Reactor at Hokuriku Shika power plant) is mentioned as being *stopped*, not something that progressed.
* Option B (Noto Peninsula) was *affected* by the tsunami, not something that progressed.
* Option D (Niigata power plant) is mentioned as having *ceased operations*.



Therefore, the disruption of railway services is the only item in the options that progressed/happened after the earthquake.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se gobetšego kudu ka baka la tšhišinyego ya lefase?","The best answer is **B: Di-reactor tše pedi seteišeneng sa mohlagase sa Shika**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph specifically states:** ""Phetogo ya Nomoro 1 le 2 go feketori ya yona ya mollo wa nuclear go la Shika e ile ya thingwa."" (Unit 1 and 2 of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata were shut down.) This directly links the global power situation disruption to the reactors at the Shika nuclear power plant.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Magae a mangwe (Other locations):** While other locations may be affected, the text *explicitly* focuses on the Shika plant's impact.
* **C: Ditsela tše dingwe (Other methods):** This is too vague. The paragraph doesn't mention any disruption to other methods of power generation.
* **D: Boemafofane bja Noto (Noto Strait):** The Noto Strait travel disruptions are a consequence of the overall situation, but not the *primary* cause of the disruption to the global power situation.

Therefore, the shutdown of the reactors at the Shika nuclear power plant is the most directly and explicitly connected factor in the disruption of the global power situation as described in the text.

"Go ya le ka pego, ke ditaba dife go tše di latelago tšeo di sa akaretšwago ka gare ga tokomane?","The correct answer is **B: Sebaki sa ntwa ya ngwaga wa 1967**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions the differences in neighboring territories *before* the 1967 Six-Day War and also refers to the future of Jerusalem. It also discusses the possibility of Israeli troops remaining in the West Bank for 10 years after a potential agreement, with the Palestinian Authority allowing a 5-year period of withdrawal.  However, the text **does not** detail the future of the territories *after* the 1967 war, only the situation *before* it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bokamoso bja Jerusalem:** The text *does* mention the future of Jerusalem.
* **C: Go ba gona ga mašole moeding:** The text *does* mention the possibility of Israeli troops remaining in the West Bank.
* **D: Go ngangišana ka mellwane:** The text *does* mention the differences in neighboring territories.



Therefore, the only option that is *not* explicitly covered in the provided text is the future of the territories *after* the 1967 war, which is essentially the situation *before* that war."
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo e sego karolo ya dinyakwa tša Palestina?,"The correct answer is **D: Go ba gona ga mašole ka mengwaga ye mehlano kua Jordan Valley**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Palestinians are seeking a five-year Israeli military withdrawal from the Jordan Valley. Option D mentions a five-year withdrawal, while option D proposes a *ten-year* withdrawal, which is a deviation from the information provided. The other options (A, B, and C) are all explicitly mentioned as part of the Palestinians' demands.
"
Ke nageng efe yeo Ma a ithutetšego tša molao go yona?,"The correct answer is **B: China**.

The text states: ""O belegwe Hong Kong, Ma o ithutile go la Yunibesithi ya New York le Sekolong sa Molao sa Harvard **gomme o ile a ba le bodudi bja go ya go ile bja Amerika ga tee bja ""karata ye tala""**. Hsieh o akantše nakong ya dikgetho gore Ma a ka tšaba ka nageng ka nako ya mathata.""

The phrase ""Amerika ga tee bja 'karata ye tala'"" refers to the United States of America. The question asks where Ma studied law. The text explicitly says she studied at Harvard Law School. The question, however, is a little misleading. The answer is the United States.

However, if we look for the specific location mentioned as a place of study *in the context of the question*, the best choice is **B: China**. The text states Ma was skilled in ""go laola kgokagano ya kgauswi le motsemogolo wa China."" This implies she studied Chinese law, making China the most likely location for her legal studies, even though the text also mentions Harvard Law School.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke baboleledi ba naga efe bao ba thušitšego gore Ma a thope dikgetho?","The correct answer is **A: United States of America**.

The passage states: ""O belegwe Hong Kong, Ma o ithutile go la Yunibesithi ya New York le Sekolong sa Molao sa Harvard gomme o ile a ba le bodudi bja go ya go ile bja Amerika ga tee bja """"""karata ye tala""""""."" This translates to ""Born in Hong Kong, Ma studied at the University of New York and Harvard Law School and became a rare talent from the United States."" This indicates that studying in the US was a key factor in her success and gaining recognition.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mang yo Carolyn Wilson a bego a mo šomela pele a tloga toropong?","The correct answer is **C: Ba OHA**.

The text states that the families started noticing Carolyn Wilson, who works for OHA, had taken their funds and left town. Therefore, she was working for OHA.
"
"Ka mabelo a mene ao a setšego sehleng se, ke mang a lego maemong a bone ba Diphadišano tša Baotledi?","The answer is **A: Hamlin**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hamlin o šaletše ka dintlha tše masomepedi, efela tše hlano pele ga Bowyer."" This means Hamlin finished 5th, and Bowyer finished 6th.  The question asks who finished in the top 5.  Only Hamlin is listed as being in the top 5 within the described scenario.
"
"Go latela mabelo ao go boletšwego ka wona karolong ye, Kahne o na le dintlha tše kae Diphadišanong tša Baotledi?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kahne le Truex, Jr. ba go la bo hlano le bo tshelela ka go latelana ka dintlha tše 2,220 le 2,207."" This directly tells us that Kahne has 2,220 points.

This translates to: ""Above the large and small meteorites that are known to have fallen on Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to have come from Mars.""

Therefore, 34 people have witnessed the fall of meteorites believed to be from Mars.
"
"Bjalo ka ge go boletšwe karolong ye, nnete ke efe ka maswika ao go hweditšwego gore a tšwa polaneteng ya martian?","The correct answer is **D: Ke a 34 ka moka**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Godimo ga maswika a magolo le a mannyane ao a tsebegago gore a ka bago a 24,000 ao a wetšego lefaseng, ke a 34 fela ao a kgonthišišitšwego gore a tšwa mars.""  This means only 34 meteorites have been confirmed to originate from Mars.
"
Schumacher o rotše modiro neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka morago ga gore Felipe Massa a thule**.

Here's why:

The question asks *why* Schumacher was replaced. The text explicitly states: ""Schumacher wo a rotšego mošomo ka 2006 ka morago ga go thopa mogopo wa Formula 1 makga a pa, o be a letešwe go tsena legatong la Felipe Massa.""  This translates to: ""Schumacher, who had been replaced in 2006 after the end of his contract, was replaced by Felipe Massa.""  The reason for the replacement was Massa's performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka morago ga go thopa sefoka ka lekga la bošupa:** (After winning a lawsuit concerning a private matter) The text doesn't mention any lawsuit.
* **C: Ka morago ga go hwetša motho wa go tšeela Felipe Massa legato:** (After finding someone to replace Felipe Massa) The text states he was *replaced* *by* Massa.
* **D: Mafelelong a sehla sa 2009:** (In the late 2009 season) While Massa's performance declined later, the primary reason for Schumacher's initial replacement was the end of his contract and then Massa's subsequent performance.



"
Massa o gobetše neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Nakong ya Grand Prix**.

The text states: ""Mo-Brazilian o gobetše kudu hlogong ka morago ga thulano nakong ya 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" which translates to ""The Brazilian was very injured after a collision during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, tokišetšo e tlo ama bjang AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Palo ya batho ba go šomiša AOL e tlo phenkgišana le ya ba go šomiša Yahoo le Microsoft**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that AOL's market share is declining due to a decrease in its Instant Messaging (IM) service usage, especially within the United States. It also predicts that the number of users of Yahoo! and Microsoft's services will surpass AOL's users. This implies a direct competition between AOL and the other two companies for IM users.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Palo ya batho ba go šomiša AOL e tlo oketšega** - This is too general. The paragraph doesn't state that AOL will completely disappear, just that its market share is shrinking.
*   **B: AOL e tlo ba khamphani e le noši yeo e dirilego tirelo ya IM** - This is inaccurate. The paragraph indicates AOL's IM service is the *reason* for its decline, not a reason for it to become a leading company in that area.
*   **D: AOL e ka se sa šomišwa kua United States** - The paragraph focuses on the decline in the US, but doesn't explicitly say AOL will stop operating there altogether.



"
Ke efe ya tše di latelago yeo e ka feleletšago e se sa le gona morago ga tokišetšo ye e mpsha?,"The correct answer is **C: Tokologo ya AOL ya go godiša kgwebo ka lebelo la yona (AOL's ability to monetize its business)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that AOL is struggling to monetize its business due to declining instant messaging usage in the United States. 
* The passage predicts that Yahoo! and Microsoft will surpass AOL in the number of users of their services. This implies AOL's revenue generation will suffer.
* Therefore, AOL's *ability to monetize its business* is what will disappear or become unsustainable.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Go hlangwa mo go atilego ga Inthanete kua United States (The growth of the Internet in the United States):** The Internet's growth is happening; the problem is AOL's inability to capitalize on it.
* **B: Go šomišwa ga mmaraka wa IM (The decline of the IM market):**  This is *already happening*, it's the *cause* of AOL's problem, not the ultimate outcome.
* **D: Tirišanommogo ya Yahoo le Microsoft (The rivalry between Yahoo! and Microsoft):** This is a general industry dynamic, not a specific outcome directly tied to AOL's struggles.



"
Ke batho ba bakae bao ba bolailwego tlhaselong bao e bego e se maphodisa?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""mesong se bolaile maphodisa a mabedi"" which translates to ""two police officers were killed"".
"
Ke mang yo a begilego yo go thwego ke mogononelwa tlhaselong yeo?,"The correct answer is **A: Maphodisa (Police)**.

The passage states: ""Kantoro ya molaodi e rile lesome-senyane la bao ba gobetšego e be e le maphodisa."" This translates to ""The morgue received a dozen bodies, and these were police officers.""  The text also mentions the police were investigating Daesh (ISIL) for the attack. Therefore, the police were the ones targeted and killed.
"
"Ka baka la seemo sa Florida sa gore mothopasefoka o tšea selete ka moka, Mitt Romney o filwe eng?","The correct answer is **B: Bonkgetheng bja Republican Party**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Florida e file baromelwa ba yona go Romney ka moka ba lesomehlano megopo, mo kgoromeletša go ya go ba wa pele bakeng sa leina la go kgethwa bakeng sa Republican Party."" 

This translates to: ""Florida gave him a total of 16 electoral votes, propelling him to the lead for the nomination of the Republican Party.""  Therefore, Romney gained the lead *within the Republican Party*.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, Gingrich o hweditše diperesente tše kae dikgethong tša mathomo?","The correct answer is **B: Diperesente tše 32**.

The text states: ""Seboledi sa pele sa U.S. sa Ntlo Newt Gingrich o bile wa bobedi ka diperesente tše 32."" This translates to ""The top House Republican, Newt Gingrich, came in second with 32 percent.""
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mang yo a tlogetšego go tsenela dikgetho ka morago ga dipoelo tša khokhase?","The correct answer is **A: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Gingrich o retile Santorum... wo legatong la gagwe dipapatšo tša go se kgahliše di be di bapatšwa go la lowa kgahlanong le Gingrich."" This indicates that Gingrich dropped out of the race after the primaries.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mang yo a boletšego gabotse kudu ka nkgetheng yo mongwe ka morago ga dipoelo tša khokhase?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Gingrich o retile Santorum..."" which means Gingrich specifically commented on Santorum after the primaries. The other options are incorrect because Perry is talking about future plans, Romney isn't mentioned in this context, and Bachmann has ended her campaign.
"
Ke lefelo lefe le nnoši leo lenaneo le bego le swarelwa go lona pele ga 2015?,"The correct answer is **B: East Texas**.

The text states: ""Lenaneo la nnete le be le na le dipapadi tša mantšu tša go hloka maitemogelo, tša selega go East Texas."" This translates to ""The actual program had news and weather updates for East Texas.""  While TogiNet Radio was the platform, East Texas was the location the program served.
"
Setiše se re lenaneo le le swere dilo tša mohuta mang?,"The answer is **C: Tša kgalekgale (Radio programs)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Matšatšing a yona a ka pela, ponagatšo yeo e be e loketšwe fela mo saeteng ya seyalemoyeng sa inthanete sa kgalekgale sa TogiNet Radio..."" which translates to ""Its programs can be found, the broadcast was only scheduled on the internet radio website of TogiNet Radio..."" This clearly indicates that the station broadcasts radio programs.
"
Ke eng se David Headley a se kgobokeditšego se se feleleditšego se thušitše mašole tlhaselong?,"The correct answer is **A: Tshedimušo (Intelligence)**.

The text states: ""Go nyaka le go kgoboketša tshedimušo ga David Headley go thušitse go dumelela tshepedišo ka boradithunya ba 10...""  This translates to: ""And the gathering of intelligence from David Headley helped to enable the planning of the 10-member group...""

Therefore, David Headley's intelligence was crucial in facilitating the attacks.
"
Ke senamelwa sefe se mašole ao a se šomišitšego go ya Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **B: Sefofane (Boat)**.

The passage states: ""Bahlasedi ba Mumbai ba fihlile ka sekepe..."" which translates to ""Attackers arrived in Mumbai by boat..."" 

Therefore, the attackers used a boat to reach Mumbai.
"
Ke lefoko lefe ka leo le bontšhago ka nepo dipoelo tša papadi ya go bula ya Nadal le Raonic Brisbane?,"The correct answer is **C: Nadal o fentše Raonic**.

The text states ""Rekhoto ya Nadal ya hlogo ka hlogo kgahlanong le Canada ke 7-2."" This translates to ""Nadal's head-to-head record against Canada is 7-2.""  Since Canada refers to Raonic in this context, it means Nadal has won 7 matches and lost 2. Therefore, Nadal defeated Raonic in their Brisbane Open match.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, seemo sa Nadal le Raonic e be e le sefe ka morago ga thaloko ya pele ya papadi?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal o fentše ka dintlha tše 76**.

The text states: ""Nadal o rwele dintlha tše 88% papading a thopa dintlha tše 76 seripeng sa pele."" This translates to: ""Nadal won 88% of the points on serve and won 76 points in the first set.""
"
Ke lenaneo la leleme lefe leo le sa akaretšwago diphatlalatšong tše tharo tše mpsha tša Naked News?,"The correct answer is **C: Japanese**.

The text explicitly states that the global court suspended the Spanish, Italian, and Korean language programs. Therefore, Japanese is the one *not* included.
"
"Go ya pego, ke kae moo dikgašo tše mpsha tša Naked News di ka se hwetšagalego gona?","The correct answer is **B: Inthaneteng**.

Here's why:

* The question asks where you can find Naked News content.
* The text states that the World Court stopped the broadcast of Naked News in specific countries. 
* Naked News is known for its explicit content, which is primarily accessed online.
* The other options (phones, pubs, TV) are less likely platforms for accessing Naked News' core content, especially given the restrictions mentioned in the text.



Therefore, **Inthaneteng** (Online) is the most logical and correct answer.
"
Ke baphadišane ba bakae bao ba sa fetšago Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **B: 117**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""36 ya baphadišane ba 116 ba hweditše dipoelo tša go swana lebelong leo."" This means 36 athletes achieved the same result as their expected time.

It also states: ""45 ya 117 ya bao ba fofago lehlweng go la Giant Slalom ba paletšwe ke go fihlelela ka gare ga lebelo."" This means 45 out of 117 athletes who were slower than their expected time finished within their time.

To find the number of athletes who *didn't* finish Giant Slalom, we need to consider the total number of athletes: 116 + 1 = 117. Since 36 athletes achieved their expected time, and the remaining athletes were either slower than their expected time or achieved their expected time, all athletes *did* participate in Giant Slalom. Therefore, the number of athletes who did not finish Giant Slalom is 117 - 36 = 81. 

However, the question specifically asks for the number of athletes who *did not* finish Giant Slalom. It is stated that 36 athletes achieved the same result as their expected time. Therefore, the remaining athletes did not achieve their expected time. 116 athletes participated in the race, and 36 achieved their expected time. The number of athletes who did not achieve their expected time is 116 - 36 = 80. However, we know from the context that the total number of athletes is 117. Therefore, the number of athletes who did not finish the race is 117 - 36 = 81. 

There appears to be a mistake in my previous reasoning. 
Let's re-examine the prompt again. ""Ke baphadišane ba bakae bao ba sa fetšago Giant Slalom?"" (How many athletes did not finish Giant Slalom?) 
The passage says ""45 ya 117 ya bao ba fofago lehlweng go la Giant Slalom ba paletšwe ke go fihlelela ka gare ga lebelo."" (45 out of 117 athletes who were slower than their expected time finished within their expected time.) 
This means that 117 - 45 = 72 athletes were slower than their expected time, and did not finish within their expected time. 
However, the question asks for how many athletes *did not* finish Giant Slalom. The answer is not 72. It is the number of athletes who *were slower than their expected time.*
The question seems poorly worded. 
If we assume that the athletes who were slower than their expected time are the athletes who *did not* finish Giant Slalom. 
Therefore, the answer is 72. But this answer is not in the options. 

Looking at the provided"
Ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago leo le bontšhago ka nepo dipoelo tša mabelo Diphadišanong?,"The correct answer is **C: Dithelela lehlweng tše oketšegilego di feditše Giant Slalom go feta Slalom.**

Here's why:

* The text states ""36 ya baphadišane ba 116 ba hweditše dipoelo tša go swana lebelong leo.""  This means 36 out of 116 athletes had the same result in the *same* discipline.
*  It then says ""Lebelo la gagwe le lengwe, Giant Slalom, le bone a fetša la bo 10 ka gare ga sehlopa sa basadi ka hlakantšo ya nako ya lebelo la metsotso ye 4:41.30, 2:11.60 go nanya go feta wa go fetša pele mo Austria Claudia Loesch le metsotso ye 1:09.02 go nanya go feta wa go fetša la bo senyane Gyöngyi Dani wa Hungary.""  This indicates that 10 athletes in Giant Slalom had a time faster than the previous best.
* Finally, ""Bao ba fofago lehlweng ba bane ka gare ga sehlopa sa go dula sa basetšwa ba paletšwe ke go fetša lebelo la bona, gomme 45 ya 117 ya palomoka ya bao ba fofago lehlweng go la Giant Slalom ba paletšwe ke go fihlelela ka gare ga lebelo.""  This means 45 out of 117 athletes in the *downhill* discipline (which includes Giant Slalom) finished faster than their expected time.

Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the athletes who finished in the top 10 in Giant Slalom finished *better* than the athletes who finished in the top 10 in Slalom.  The text doesn't directly say athletes who finished last in Slalom did better in Giant Slalom, but the wording ""finished faster than their expected time"" implies a general improvement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Carpenado o feditše maemong a bolesome go Slalom:** The text doesn't mention Carpenado's performance in Slalom.
* **B:  The text states ""36 ya baphadišane ba 116 ba hweditše dipoelo tša go swana lebelong leo.""  This means 36"
Ke eng sa dilo tše di latelago seo NBA e tšerego sephetho sa go se emišanyana?,"The correct answer is **C: Moraloki ofe goba ofe yo a hweditšwego a na le twatši ya COVID-19**.

Here's why:

The passage states the NBA postponed games *because* of a positive COVID-19 test within the Utah Jazz organization. The key factor that triggered the postponement is the individual who tested positive.  The other options are related to the situation, but the *cause* of the postponement is the positive test of an individual.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng se se dirilego gore NBA e be le matshwenyego ka twatši ye?","The correct answer is **D: Moraloki wa Utah Jazz go hweditšwe gore o na le twatši**.

The passage states: ""Kgetho ya NBA e latetše teko ya sebapadi sa Utah Jazz sa goba posetifi bakeng sa twatši ya COVID-19."" This translates to ""The NBA postponed a game of the Utah Jazz after a player tested positive for COVID-19."" Therefore, a player on the Utah Jazz tested positive.
"
Ke mang yo a nwešitšego ntlha ya go thopa papadi sehlopheng sa Washington Capitals godimo Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Thušo ya pele ya Ovechkin ya bošego e be e le ntlheng ya go thopa papadi ka mošemane Nicklas Backstorm..."" which translates to ""Ovechkin's first assist was to Nicklas Backstrom...""
"
Ke mang yo a nwešitšego ntlha ya gagwe ya bo 60 bakeng sa sehla ge Capitals e be e raloka le Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The question states: ""Ntlha ya gagwe ya bo 60 bakeng sa sehla... ge Capitals e be e raloka le Thrashers.""  This refers to Alex Ovechkin achieving his 60th goal of the season *during* the game against the Thrashers.
"
Ke neng moo panka ya Northern Rock e ilego ya hloka thekgo ya mmušo?,"The correct answer is **D: Nakong ya mathata a dintlo a tša ditšhelete** (During times of financial difficulty).

The passage states: ""Northern Rock o nyakile thekgo ka lebaka la go ba nyanyeng ka nako ya bothata bja tumelelano ya semolao ye kgolo nyana ka 2007."" (Northern Rock needed bailout money because it was struggling during the time of the major credit crunch in 2007.)

While the other options are related to the timeline, they don't directly answer *why* Northern Rock needed the bailout. It was due to financial trouble caused by the credit crunch.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mafoko afe ao a latelago a hlalošago ka nepo tirišano ya Sehlopha sa Virgin le panka ya Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: Sehlopha sa Virgin se rekile panka ka morago ga gore e dirwe ya setšhaba.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Virgin sa Mohlomphegi Richard Branson se bile le peelo ya theko bakeng sa panka yeo e gannwego pele ga ge panka yeo e dirwa ya naga. Ka 2010, ka nako ya ge e le ya setšhaba, panka ya mmila o mogolo ya bjale ya Northern Rock plc e be e arogantšwe go tšwa go 'panka ye mphe', Northern Rock (Bolaodi bja Thoto). Virgin rekile fela 'panka ye botse' ya Northern Rock, e seng khamphane ya bolaodi bja dithoto.""

This clearly indicates that Virgin bought the ""good bank"" (Northern Rock (Grounds Bank)) *after* the nationalization of the ""bad bank"" (Northern Rock (Mortgages)).



The other options are incorrect because:

* **A:** While Virgin *did* buy a bank, the wording ""Sehlopha sa Virgin le sona e rekile khamphani ya bolaodi bja dithoto ya Northern Rock"" is imprecise.  They didn't buy the whole banking group; they bought a portion.
* **C:** The passage mentions Virgin providing funding *before* nationalization, but this isn't the main point about their acquisition.
* **D:**  The passage states Virgin's investment happened *before* the nationalization, not *after*.



"
"Bjalo ka ge go boletšwe ka karolong ye, ke naga efe yeo e kgongwago ke go saenwa ga tumelelano ya leratadima la Kyoto?","The correct answer is **A: United States**.

The passage states: ""Sephetho sa Mr. Rudd sa go saena tumelelo ya leratadima la Kyoto se aroganya United States..."" This directly indicates that the United States is the nation refusing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
"
Mmušo wa peleng wa Australia o ile wa nagana gore go saena Kyoto go tlo gobatša eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikonomi ya naga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mmušo wa peleng wa hlokomelo wa Australia o ganne go phošolla Kyoto, ka la gore go ka senya ekhonomi ka go ithekga kudu ga yona go iša malahla ka dinageng tša ka ntle..."" This translates to: ""The previous Australian government refused to ratify Kyoto, because it could harm the economy by heavily relying on emissions from other countries...""

Therefore, the Australian government's concern was the potential damage to *their own economy*.  While the passage mentions emissions from other countries, the *reason* for not ratifying Kyoto was the impact on Australia's economy.



"
Ke lenaneo lefe leo bathuntši ba dithabeng ba bileditšwego go lona?,"The correct answer is **D: Lenaneo la go tsoma la Shooters Association**.

The text states: ""...baithaopi bao ba loketšego ba thwetšwe, ka fase ga lenaneo la go tsoma la Sporting Shooters Association."" This directly indicates the shooting association's shooting program is the relevant program.
"
Ke lefoko lefe leo le sa bolelego nnete ka teko ya taolo ya diji?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka ge e be e le teko ya pele ya lenaneo, ga se le sekasekwe (Although it was the first test of the program, it wasn't a secret)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states the tests were being monitored and evaluated.** The passage emphasizes the scrutiny the shooters were under. Therefore, it *cannot* be true that it was a secret test. The opposite is true.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: Bathuntši ba neilwe ditaelo tša tlwaetšo (Shooters were given safety instructions):** The text mentions the shooters received safety instructions and training.
* **C: Bathuntši ba be ba beilwe leihlo ke bahlokomedi ba diphaka (Shooters were watched by wildlife officers):**  The text states rangers were closely monitoring the shooters.
* **D: Go ile gwa kgethwa bathuntši ba bane (Four shooters were selected):** The text confirms four shooters were selected for the initial tests.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, monga o hweditšwe kae?","The correct answer is **D: Kua Ethiopia**.

Here's why:

* The quote mentions Berhane Asfaw is with the Rift Valley Research Service in **Ethiopia**.  While the discovery happened in the Rift Valley, Ethiopia is specified as the location of the research service. 

Therefore, Ethiopia is the most accurate and complete answer.
"
"Go ya pego, go ile gwa direga’ng go sa letelwa?","The correct answer is **C: Go ile gwa sekasekwa bohlatse bja molekula** (It was the molecular density that was separated).

The quote says: ""Seo se ra gore se sengwe le se sengwe se swanetše go boetšwa morago,"" which translates to ""What we say is that everything needs to be studied later.""  The preceding context describes the molecular density being the primary factor before the darkness.  Therefore, the separation of the molecular density was the thing that was delayed in being studied.
"
Go nyakega eng gore mmapadi a laole mesepelo nakong ya papadi ya bidio?,"The correct answer is **D: Go sepetša moyeng motšhene wa go laola papadi** (To control the game system with movements in the air).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Se se tla dumelela dibapadi go laola ditiro le mesepelo ka gare ga dipapadi tša bedio ka go šutiša sedirišwa moyeng."" (This will allow players to control actions and commands within video games by shooting a signal in the air). This directly refers to controlling the game using air motion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go netefatša gore motšhene wa go laola papadi o kgauswi le khonsoulu** (To ensure the game control system is connected to the console): While connectivity is important, the passage focuses on *how* players will control the game, not the connection itself.
* **B: Go raloka ka khutlotharo** (To use four controllers): The passage mentions four sensors placed above the TV, not controllers.
* **C: Go swarela motšhene wa go laola papadi kgauswi le thelebišene** (To connect the game control system to the television): Similar to option A, this talks about connection, not the control mechanism.



"
Ke eng seo se dirilwego gore se swane le selaodi sa telebišene?,"The correct answer is **A: Disensara tše pedi tša motšhene wa go laola papadi (Two sensors on the game controller)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go la tlišetšo ya polelo ya thwadi ya ka Labone ya Ponagatšo ya Papadi ya Tokyo, mopresidente wa Nintendo Satoru Iwata o tšweleditše setalwa sa selaodi bakeng sa khonsole ye ntswa ya khamphane ya Nintendo Revolution. Go tswana le selaodi sa telebišene, selaodi se šomiša dikwe tše pedi tšeo di beilwego kgauswi le telebišene ya modiriši go triangulata maemo a yona lefelong la mamanoga a mararo.""

This translates to: ""According to a report from the Japanese Game Show, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata developed a controller device for Nintendo's new console, the Nintendo Revolution. Unlike a television controller, the controller uses two sensors placed on top of the television to triangulate its position in three-dimensional space.""

The key is that the new controller *uses two sensors*.  The question asks what it's *like* a television controller. The answer is that it uses two sensors on the game controller.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Motšhene wa go laola khonsole ya Nintendo Revolution (The control system of the Nintendo Revolution console):** This is too broad. While the controller is part of the console's control system, the question asks for a specific comparison.
* **C: Letlakala la sekirini sa papadi (The game screen display):**  This refers to the visual output, not the controller's mechanism.
* **D: Khonsoule ya Nintendo Revolution (The Nintendo Revolution console):** This is the console itself, not a component *like* a television controller.



"
Ke’ng seo se sa bolelwago pegong ya moragobjale ya go tšwa go boraditaba ba Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Sefofane se eme go la Ürümqi**.

Here's why:

The text states that the plane *failed to stay* in Ürümqi before returning from Afghanistan. This implies that it *did not* stay in Ürümqi. The other options are explicitly stated as facts in the article.
"
Ke’ng seo se sa bolelwago ka pegong e mpsha ya boraditaba ba Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Sefofane se ile sa hlaselwa** (The bird was attacked).

Here's why:

* The text states the bird was found with a **snake bite** (botšhošetši bja sethuthupi).  This implies an attack.
* Option C is true, but it's a statement *from* the news report, not something *not* mentioned.
* Option D is also true, it's explicitly mentioned.
* Option B is misleading.  The text doesn't say the bird *refused* to fly; it flew to Afghanistan and then was found.



Therefore, the only option that isn't explicitly mentioned or implied by the text is that the bird was attacked.



"
Ke’ng seo se tsebišitšwego ke Sara Danius nakong ya lenaneo la radiong?,"The correct answer is **A: Mothopa sefoka sa Nobel Prize go tša bongwadi**.

Here's why:

The text states Sara Danius discussed the delay in the Swedish Academy's selection of Bob Dylan for the 2016 Literature Prize. She mentioned that they had finally reached an agreement with Dylan. This directly relates to him winning the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Komiti ga se ya hwetša dikarabo go tšwa go badirišanimmogo:** The text says they *did* get responses and reached an agreement.
* **C: Bonkgetheng ba 2016 ba sefoka sa Nobel Price go tša bongwadi:** This is partially true (referring to the 2016 prize), but the core of Danius's statement is about Dylan *winning* the prize, not just being nominated.
* **D: Komiti e tlo kgaotša go leka go ikgokaganya le Bob Dylan:** The text indicates they *have* reached an agreement and are done with the efforts to contact Dylan.
"
Ke mang yo ba paletšwego ke go mo hwetša?,"The correct answer is **A: Modirišanimmogo wa kgauswi wa Bob Dylan**.

The text states that Sara Danius sent emails to **Bob Dylan's manager** and received positive replies. Therefore, Bob Dylan's manager is the one who was contacted/reached out to.
"
Ke mang yo a boletšego gore kholofetšo ke “kgatho ye kgolo”?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The text states: ""Seboledi sa Bush Gordon Johndroe o biditše kholofetšo ya North Korea """"""kgatho ye kgolo go ya ntlheng ya go fihlelela go fokotša di nuclear yeo e netefadi ya Korean peninsula."""""" This translates to: ""Bush's spokesman Gordon Johndroe called North Korea's statement """"""a significant escalation regarding its pursuit of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.""""""

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who used the phrase ""kgatho ye kgolo"" (significant escalation).
"
Ke ditempe tše kae tšeo Slania a di tšweleditšego bakeng sa dinaga tša go fapafapana?,"The correct answer is **D: Tša go feta 1,000**.

The text states: ""O tšweleditše ditempe tša go feta 1,000 bakeng sa Sweden le dinaga tše dingwe tše 28.""  This translates to ""He created stamps for over 1,000 for Sweden and 28 other countries."""
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se kago se baka go dutla mo go tšwelago pele mašobaneng a tanka?","The correct answer is **A: Ge karolo ya bobedi ya bobolokelo e tletše kudu** (When the second support beam is too loose).

Here's why:

The passage states that the oil leak was traced to a loose fitting on the oil pipelines near Fairbanks, Alaska.  Later, the passage says the second support beam under the tanks had the capacity to contain 104,500 barrels and *that* is where a leak occurred. The passage implies the loose support beam contributed to the leak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Diteko tša ka mehla tša tshepedišo ya go laola mollo** (Daily oil control maintenance tests): These tests were in place *after* the initial leak and helped to manage the situation. They didn't cause the leak.
* **C: Diphetogo ka gare ga tanka** (Changes inside the tank): While changes inside the tank could cause issues, the passage focuses on a structural problem (the support beam).
* **D: Mollo go se sengwe sa diteišene sa diphaepe sa Fort Greely** (Other oil fittings at Fort Greely): The passage specifically mentions the fitting near Fairbanks, Alaska. It doesn't mention any other fittings at Fort Greely causing the problem.



"
Go’reng mašobana a go thuša a ile a bula?,"The correct answer is **D: Karolo ya bobedi ya bobolokelo e be e sa kgone go swara ditanka tše lekanego.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go tloga ka Laboraro mathapama, mo ditanka di ntšago moya go be go sa dutla mohlomongwe go tšwa go katoga ga phišo ka gare ga tanka. Lefelo la se sengwe sa go lokela sa bobedi ka fase ga ditanka se be se sena bokgone bja go swara dibarele tše 104,500 se sešo se tlala la go tšhologa.""

This directly indicates that the secondary containment area (the one designed to catch spills) was unable to contain the spill of 104,500 barrels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go’reng mašobana a go thuša a ile a bula?** (The temperature change that helped open?) - The passage mentions a temperature change *after* the spill, not as a cause of it.
* **B: Mohlagase o ile wa kgaoga ka morago ga diteko tša tshepedišo ya go laola mollo** (Electricity helped after the oil spill control tests) - While electricity is important for oil spill control, the passage doesn't state it directly helped *open* the leak.  The tests were conducted *because* of the leak.
* **C: Ditanka di be di tletše kudu** (The tanks were very full) - The passage doesn't mention the tank's fullness.

Therefore, option D is the only one directly supported by the text.
"
"Gona bjale, meetse a fihla kae ka gare ga Lekala la Bosenyane?","The correct answer is **C: A fihla mathekeng** (It reaches the rooftops).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lekala la bo Senyane, leo le bonego mafula go ya godimo go fihla maoto a 20 nakong ya Hurricane Katrina...Meetse a tšholloga godimo ga levee ka seripa sa go bulega ga maoto a 100.""  This means the water reached the rooftops *after* the levee broke, and the levee broke after water level reached 100 feet. So, the water reached the rooftops, which is the same as saying it reached the ""mathekeng"" (roofs).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maoto a 20:** This refers to how high the water rose *during* Hurricane Katrina, not the current situation.
* **B: Di inche tše 6:** This refers to the amount of flood protection that the US government says can prevent flooding.
* **D: Dikgato tše 100:** This is the height the levee was overwhelmed at, not where the water ultimately reached.



"
"Nakong ya Hurricane Katrina, go diragatšeng ka gare ga Lekala la Bosenyane?","The correct answer is **A: Mafula a be a le maoto a 100 ka bophara**

The text states: ""Mafula a be a le maoto a 100 ka bophara nakong ya Hurricane Katrina."" which translates to ""The waters were 100 feet wide during Hurricane Katrina.""
"
Ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se sa netefatšwago ke Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **D: Seemo sa molwetši sa gona bjale (The patient's current speech)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Howard University Hospital followed isolation protocols, *including separating the patient from others to prevent further transmission.*  This implies the patient was isolated *because* of a potential Ebola infection.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Moo molwetši a ilego gona (Where the patient came from):** The passage explicitly states the patient came from Nigeria, where Ebola was present. This is mentioned as context.
*   **B: Kgonagalo ya ge e ba balwetši ba bangwe ba fetetšwe ke twatši (The risk of other patients being infected):** The entire isolation protocol was *to prevent* this risk. The passage directly supports this.
*   **C: Ge e ba go latetšwe megato ya maleba (The implementation of isolation measures):** The passage states that protocols *were* followed, so this is directly supported.
*   **D: Seemo sa molwetši sa gona bjale (The patient's current speech):** The passage **does not** mention anything about the patient's current speech.  It only details the initial isolation procedures. Therefore, it's the only option that cannot be confirmed as true based on the information given.

Therefore, D is the correct answer."
Ke eng se boramahlale ba nyakago go se tseba?,"The correct answer is **D: Gore nna lefase le hlamegile bjang** (How the Earth itself was formed).

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists have made progress understanding the formation of planets, including Earth, by studying meteorites. It emphasizes the link between meteorites and the early Earth. The question asks what scientists *don't* know. The passage focuses on understanding planet formation *in general* and the Earth's formation *relative to other planets*. It doesn't state they fully understand *how* Earth itself solidified or became a solid planet.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ge maswika a go ba le dikgase a thulana le Lefase** (Whether meteorites have gases similar to Earth): The passage mentions studying meteorites to understand Earth's formation, suggesting they *do* have some similarities in composition, even if not perfectly identical.
* **B: Gore naa diporotheine di hlamega bjang** (How proteins fold): The passage mentions proteins but doesn't imply that protein folding is the key unknown in Earth's formation. It's a separate area of scientific study.
* **C: Gore naa podišwa ke eng** (What it's composed of): The passage specifically mentions that scientists study meteorites to learn about the composition of the early Earth. This suggests they have *some* understanding of the Earth's composition, though perhaps not a complete one.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that scientists don't fully understand *how* the Earth solidified or became a solid planet.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, maphodisa a tikologong a kgathile tema efe gore mmila o tswalelwe?","The correct answer is **B: Ba itšeetše sephetho sa go o tswalela.**

The text states: ""Le ge baemedi ba molao ba se na bonnet bja tšhošetšo, ba Molao wa Dinamelwa ba tswaletše ka kgapeletšo ya FBI."" This directly indicates the FBI *fabricated* the case. Therefore, the police *expected* the case to have been fabricated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba hlohleleditše ba FBI go re ba o tswalele:** The text doesn't say they *investigated* the FBI to find out if they fabricated it. It says the FBI fabricated it.
* **C: Ba laetše baotledi ba difatanaga gore ba šomiše ditsela tše dingwe:** The text mentions stopping drug trafficking routes, but doesn't say they *instructed* the teenagers to do anything else.
* **D: Ba begile gore go na le moelo o montši wa difatanaga mebileng e mengwe:** While the text mentions a lack of organized crime, it doesn't say there were *other* organized crime rings.

Therefore, **B** is the only option that accurately reflects the information given in the text.
"
Go diragetše eng ka ditsejana tša ka fase ga mmu ge ditsela di be di tswaletšwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Di šomišitšwe bjalo ka tsela ya go aroga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditheraka tša go rwala ditšhila di be di šomišwa go thiba mejako..."" which translates to ""The efforts to crack the code were deployed to prevent attacks..."" This indicates that the code was being used to *prevent* something, implying it was being used for *deception or disguise*, which aligns with the idea of being used as a way to *disrupt* or *break up* the pattern.

The other options don't fit the context:

*   **A: Di be di tswaletšwe (were created)** - The passage doesn't say the code was created; it focuses on its use.
*   **C: Di be di buletšwe dikoloi (were hidden in cars)** - There's no mention of the code being hidden in vehicles.
*   **D: Go be go na le dikoloi tše dintši kudu ka pele (there were too many cars in front)** - This is irrelevant to the code's use.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se sa diragalago pele motšeadiswantšho a ka thulwa ke koloi?","The correct answer is **A: Motšeadiswantšho o laetšwe ke Lephodisa la Tlhokomelo ya Mmila o Mogolo gore a boele morago ka mošola wa tsela.**

The text explicitly states: ""TMZ ya weposaete ya ditaba tša boithabišo e kwešiša gore radiswantšho o emišitše safatanaga ya gagwe lehlakoreng le lengwe la Sepulveda Boulevard gomme a leka go tšea diswantšho tša boemo bja maphodisa pele a tshela tsela le go tšwelapele, nyakišiša mohlankedi wa maphodisa wa Tlhokomelo ya Mmila o mogolo wa California a emiša balaodi ba sephethephethe go mo laela go **boela morago ka mošola wa tsela** gabedi.""

The text states: ""TMZ ya weposaete ya ditaba tša boithabišo e kwešiša gore radiswantšho o emišitše safatanaga yeo ehlakoreng le lengwe la Sepulveda Boulevard **mafela a leka go tšea diswantšho tša boemo bja maphodisa pele a tshela tsela le go tšwelapele**...""  This means he was trying to drive on Sepulveda Boulevard.
"
Ke lefoko lefe leo le sa hlalosego ka nepo seemo sa mopresidente ka morago ga go hwetša gore o na le twatši?,"The correct answer is **C: O seemong setee**.

Here's why:

* The sentence says, ""Kantle ga letadi le go baba ga mogolo, ke ikwa ke le kaone gomme ke le boemong bjo bo botse go tšwelapele ka mošomo wa ka wa tša megala."" This translates to ""Along with the investigation and the death of the elder, I consider myself to be in a delicate position and in a position that is good for me to continue with my work as a minister.""

* ""Boemong bjo bo botse"" refers to a ""delicate position"" or ""sensitive situation."" ""Setee"" means delicate or sensitive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga a ikwe a le kaone** - ""Ga a ikwe a le kaone"" means ""He considers himself to be in a good position"" - the opposite of what the sentence implies.
* **B: O kwa go baba ga mogolo** - ""O kwa go baba ga mogolo"" means ""He comes from the death of the elder"" - this is a separate fact, not the description of his position.
* **D: O na le letadi** - ""O na le letadi"" means ""He has an investigation"" - also a separate fact, not the description of his position.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe gare ga mafoko a leo le bolelago nnete ka mopresidente?","The correct answer is **C: O gabotse gore a ka šomela ka gae (He is confident that he can continue working from home)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kantle ga letadi le go baba ga mogolo, ke ikwa ke le kaone gomme ke le boemong bjo bo botse go tšwelapele ka mošomo wa ka wa tša megala."" This translates to: ""After the medical examination and consultations, I am confident and in good condition to continue working in my job.""

This directly indicates the President is confident he can work from home.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga a na letadi (There is no investigation):** The passage explicitly mentions medical examinations (""letadi le go baba"").
* **B: O tla dula gae dibeke tše mmalwa (He will stay home for a few weeks):**  The passage says he's returning to work (""Ke letsetše go boela mešomong yaka ka moka ka Mošupulogo"").
* **D: O swerwe ke mohuta o šoro wa twatši (He is cursed by a bad kind of witchcraft):**  There is absolutely no mention of witchcraft in the passage.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke neng mo ledimo la Gonu go letetšwego gore le tšwelepele go fela maatla?","The correct answer is **A: Pele ga go fihla Maldives**.

The text states: ""Pele ga lehono ka dinako tša pele, meboya e be e le go 83 km/h, gomme go be go letetšwe gore e tšwelepele go fela maatla.""  This means that *before* it reached the Maldives, the flight was forced to reduce speed to conserve fuel.

Option B is incorrect because the speed was reduced *before* reaching 83 km/h. Options C and D are incorrect because the statement refers to the situation *before* reaching the Maldives.
"
Meboya e be e kitima ka lebelo lefe mafelelong a ledimo la Gonu?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikilomitara tše 149 ka iri**.

The question asks about how much the speed exceeded the initial speed. The initial speed was 83 km/h, and the maximum speed reached was 149 km/h.

149 - 83 = 66 km/h

However, none of the options reflect this. The question is phrased strangely. It's asking about the *maximum* distance reached, not the *excess* speed. The distance is stated as 149 miles. The provided options are a mix of kilometers and miles, and are not directly derived from the information provided relating to the speed increase. However, given the options, the closest answer is ""Dikilomitara tše 149 ka iri"", despite the question being poorly worded. There is no correct response given the provided context.

However, I am forced to choose one answer, and the provided answer is in kilometers. The initial speed was in kilometers per hour (km/h) and the distance reached is stated in miles. Therefore the most sensible choice from the list is:

**C: Di-mile tše 149 ka iri**

This is likely a typo in the prompt and should be **A: Dikilomitara tše 149 ka iri**.
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se sa lebelelwego e le seka sa Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **C: E na le disele tše dintšhi (It has many spines)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that *Karenia brevis* is a type of **red tide (hlolwago ka meetseng)**.
* It mentions that *Karenia brevis* blooms (gona ga Karenia brevis ya go ba godimo go feta tlwaelo) and produces neurotoxins (neurotoxin yeo e ka kgonago go golofatša megatšhika).
* The passage explicitly states that the red tide can cause fish kills (Dihlapi gantši di hwa ka lebaka la ditšhila tše ntši ka gare ga meetse).
* While option B is true (it *can* harm fish and humans), the question asks for something *not* considered a characteristic of *Karenia brevis*.
* The passage doesn't mention anything about *Karenia brevis* having many spines. It's a type of algae, not a creature with spines.

Therefore, the answer is **C**.



"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo Karena brevis e sa kgonego go se dira?,"The correct answer is **C: Go ama meetse (To carry water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *Karenia brevis* is linked to algal blooms, which are excessive growth of algae. These blooms *cause* water to become murky or cloudy (ama meetse). The passage explicitly says algae blooms can ""kopana go tšweletša maemo a makaone"" which translates to ""lead to murky water conditions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go golofatša megalatšhika ya dihlapi (To poison fish):** The passage states that algae blooms *can* poison fish, but *Karenia brevis* itself doesn't directly poison them. It's the toxins produced by the algae that cause the poisoning.
*   **B: Go oketšega ka lebelo ka fase ga seemo sefe goba sefe (To accumulate at the bottom of the sea):** The passage mentions algae blooms increase the number of algae but doesn't state that algae accumulate at the bottom of the sea.
*   **D: Go tšweletša neurotoxin (To produce neurotoxins):** The passage states that algae *produce* neurotoxins, but *Karenia brevis* doesn't directly produce them. The algae does.

Therefore, the only thing the passage implies *Karenia brevis* doesn't do is carry water."
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se sa diregago ka baka la Ledimo la Felicia?","The correct answer is **C: Magadima a go se kgaotše (Non-gusting winds)**.

The passage states: ""Mašaledi a yona a tšweleditše marothodi go akaretša dihlakahlaka tše ntši, le ge go fihla ga bjale, ga go tshenyego goba meetsefula tšeo di begilwego."" This means the winds haven't reached destructive levels yet. The passage also mentions ""Dipula tše dingwe di be di na le dipula tša magadima le go gadima kgafetša,"" indicating thunderstorms and gusty winds. However, the key is that the winds aren't yet *gusting* in a destructive way.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pula ya go ba le mohola (Hurricane-like storm):** The passage explicitly states the storm is being described as ""mohola"" (hurricane-like).
* **B: Pula ya magadima (Thunderstorm):**  The passage mentions thunderstorms as part of the other weather phenomena.
* **D: Mafula a mebileng (Heavy rain):** The passage states ""dipula tše dingwe di be di na le dipula tša magadima le go gadima kgafetša,"" which indicates rain.



"
Ke lefoko lefe la mabapi le Ledimo la Felicia leo e sego nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: Pula ya ledimo leo e hotše motse wa Oahu**.

The text states the storm *threatened* Oahu, not that it hit it. The text says, ""Tebelelo, e fila di inche tše 6.34 peelong go Oahu..."" meaning the storm is expected to impact Oahu. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Mathomong go be go thwe ke ledimo la go fokola pele le fetogela go ledimo la Legoro 4:** The text explicitly states the storm was forecast to become a Category 4 hurricane.
* **C: Dihlakahlaka tše dintši di ile tša itemogela dipula:** The text mentions the storm caused multiple tornadoes.
* **D: Dipula tše dingwe di be di na le magadima:** The text states that other storms included thunderstorms and gusty winds.

Ke lefoko lefe leo le bolelago ka nepo dipoelo tša 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. o kobilwe ka morago ga moo.**

The text states: ""Piquet Jr. o fegilwe ka morago ga 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" (Piquet Jr. was banned after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix). Therefore, option C accurately reflects the event.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernando Alonso o bile kotsing:** While Alonso was involved in the safety car incident in 2008, the text doesn't say he was in danger during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
* **B: Piquet Jr. o thopile sefoka:**  The text says Piquet Jr. was *banned*, not that he crashed.
* **D: Koloi ya tša tšhireletšego e bile kotsing:** The text mentions the safety car, but doesn't say the safety cars were in an accident. It's Piquet Jr. who was penalized.



"
Kotsi e diragetše neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Gateetee ka morago ga gore koloi ya Alonso e eme go newa thušo**.

The text states: ""Piquet Jr. o fegilwe ka morago ga 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. Gateetee ka morago ga gore koloi ya Alonso e eme go newa thušo.""  This translates to: ""Piquet Jr. was penalized after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.  He was penalized after Alonso's car stopped to get assistance.""

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe se tšerego nako e kopana go feta kamoo banyakišiši ba bego ba naganne ka gona mathomong?","The correct answer is **C: Go ikatiša magareng ga mehuta ya diphedi (Hybridization between species)**.

The passage states: ""...scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden found that the finches evolved from just two ancestral species, the endemic Darwin finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and an immigrant finch, *Geospiza conirostris*. **However, the expected time for diversification, even with the possibility of evolution over a long period, was exceeded by the occurrence of hybridization between the two finch species.**""

Therefore, the unexpected event was hybridization.
"
Ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se sa begwago ke banyakišiši?,"The correct answer is **C: Leina la mohuta o moswa wa diphedi** (The name of the finch species).

Here's why:

The passage states that the researchers identified that two finch species, *Geospiza fortis* and *Geospiza conirostris*, evolved from a common ancestor.  They then named these species.  The question asks what the researchers *didn't* determine. The passage doesn't mention the specific names of the finch species they discovered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moo mohuta wa diphedi o bopegilego gona** (The ancestral finch species): The passage *does* say they identified a common ancestor.
*   **B: Botelele bja mogato wa tlhagelelo** (The length of the beak): While beak length is mentioned as a trait that diverged between the species, the passage doesn't say the researchers determined the length.
*   **D: Dinonyana tše di kgathilego tema boikatišong** (Finches that helped in the experiment): The passage describes the research, not the specific finches used as part of an experiment.



"
Pontšho ya dikgomo tša go bopšwa e ile go direga kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Toropong ya Bucharest**.

The text states: ""Motse e tlo ba wa mathomo go la borwa-bohlabela bja Yuropa go swara CowParade..."" which translates to ""The city will be the first in Northwestern Europe to host CowParade..."" and then further specifies that it will be in Bucharest.
"
Ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago leo le hlalošago ka nepo pontšho ya dikgomo tša go bopšwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ke tiragalo ya tša bokgabo yeo e swarwago ka selemo dinageng ka moka tša ka borwabohlabela bja Yuropa.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that CowParade is a ""motse e tlo ba wa mathomo go la borwa-bohlabela bja Yuropa go swara CowParade, moletlo wo mogologolo lefaseng wa bokgabo ba bohle, gare ga June le Agostose ngwageng wo."" (The city will be the first in Northwestern Europe to host CowParade, a major global art event, between June and August of that year.)
* Option C accurately describes CowParade as an annual art exhibition across European countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E direga feela ditoropong tše di bonwago di na le bokgoni go tša “bokgabo”** (It only happens in visible cities that have the ability to ""art"") - This is too vague and doesn't capture the essence of CowParade.
* **B: E dirilwe ke Bucharest City Hall** (It is organized by Bucharest City Hall) - While the City Hall is involved, it doesn't fully describe what CowParade *is*.
* **D: Ke tiragalo e kgolokgolo ya batho bohle ya tša bokgabo mo lefaseng** (It is a global exhibition of all art people in the world) - While CowParade is *global*, the text specifies it's an *art event* and not just a general exhibition of art.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and comprehensive description of the art event described in the text.
"
Ke eng seo se dirilego gore Russia emiše go šomiša II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Kotsi**.

The text explicitly states: ""Il-76 e bile karolo ye kgolo ya bobedi mašole a Russia le Soviet go tloga ka di 1970, gomme e be e tšetše e bone kotsi ye kgolo Russia kgwedi ya go feta.""  This means the Il-76 fleet was grounded due to a major accident. The text then continues saying ""Russia bolokile Il-76s morago ga kotsi yeo."" (Russia kept the Il-76s after the accident). This indicates the accident is the reason why Russia stopped using them.



The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mašole a ka gare ga naga:** While the aircraft served the military, the text doesn't say this is the *reason* for halting use.
* **C: Mašole a Soviet:** The aircraft was used by both Soviet and Russian military forces, so this isn't the reason.
* **D: Nyakišišo yeo e tšwelago pele:** While research was being conducted, the text directly attributes the grounding to the accident, not ongoing research.



"
II-76 ke’ng?,"The correct answer is **C: Sefofane** (Airplane).

The text explicitly states that the Il-76 is an ""Il-76, e bile karolo ye kgolo ya bobedi mašole a Russia le Soviet go tloga ka di 1970"" which translates to ""Il-76, which was a major part of the air forces of Russia and the Soviet Union from the 1970s.""  This clearly indicates it's an airplane.
"
Ke mang yo a hirilego sehlopha sa bangwadi bakeng sa The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states: ""Ka 1989 o thušitše go hlola di Simpsons le Brooks le Groening, gomme o be a na le maikarabelo a go thwala sehlopa sa mathomo sa go ngwala lenaneo."" This translates to: ""In 1989 he assisted in developing The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and he had the opportunity to hire the first writing staff.""
"
"Go ya ka Fluke, ke mang yo a bego a mo romela melaetša ye mebotse le ya go kgothatša?","The correct answer is **D: Bobedi banna le basadi**.

The passage states that Fluke received positive feedback and endorsements from *both* women and men who advocate for safety measures.
"
"Go ya pego, ke eng seo batho ba bangwe ba bego ba sa nyake basadi ba bolela ka sona?","The correct answer is **B: Ditefelo tša maphelo**.

Here's why:

The passage states Fluke was approached by many positive feedback and endorsements from both women and men who advocate for the importance of safety guidelines *regarding women talking about other women's lives*. This strongly implies that what people were hesitant about women discussing was the **details of other people's lives** - their personal affairs, situations, and experiences. 

The other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Batho ba banna** - While men may have been involved in the endorsements, the core issue isn't about men's feelings.
*   **C: Seemo sa maphelo sa basadi** -  The passage doesn't explicitly say it's about the life stories *themselves*, but rather the potential for oversharing or discussing private matters.
*   **D: Fluke** - Fluke is the person who received the endorsements, not the topic of discussion.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke polanete efe e lego e kgolokgolo?","The correct answer is **A: Lefase**.

The text explicitly states: ""go na le mmele wa polanete wo tee fela wo o bontšago maatla a motheo go feta Titan, gomme leina la yona ke Lefase,"" which translates to ""there is only one planet that shows the power of its core more than Titan, and its name is Earth."" Therefore, the text directly identifies Earth as the spherical planet being described.
"
Dinoka le matsha tša go ba le seela sa go swana le meetse di bonwe polaneteng efe?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The text says: ""E a bonagala bjalo ka fao meetse a lego ka gona. Kafao ge o be o eme kgauswi le lebopo, o be o ka kgona go bona fase go ya mo go lego maswikana goba ditšhila tšeo di bego di le gona kua fase. Go ya le ka mo re tsebago ka gona, go na le mmele wa polanete wo tee fela wo o bontšago maatla a motheo go feta Titan, gomme leina la yona ke Lefase,"" which translates to: ""It looks like that where water exists. If you were standing above the surface, you would be able to see the bottom where there are volcanoes or other things that are there below. According to what we know about it, there is only one planet that shows the power of the core more than Titan, and its name is Earth.""

This implies that Titan is the only planet mentioned that has a subsurface ocean similar to Earth. The question asks which planet has a subsurface ocean *like* Earth, and the text explicitly links Titan to this characteristic.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Titan**.
"
Ke’ng sa dikutollo tše seo e sego ditlamorago tša go utollwa ga lefofa?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwešišo ya gore mafofa a be a sa šomišwe go difofane (The understanding that feathers were not primarily for flight).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the feather structure (barbs and barbules) suggests feathers evolved for purposes other than flight, such as temperature regulation or display.  It says the feathers ""did not evolve for flight.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mmala wa mafofa a diphedi (The color of dinosaur feathers):**  While the passage mentions color analysis, it's not the *primary* discovery about feather evolution. The key takeaway is *what* feathers were used for.
* **C: Go kwešiša tlhagelelo ya mafofa (Understanding the function of feathers):** This is closely related to B, but B is the more specific and direct answer to the question.
* **D: Kgonthišetšo ya gore bontši bja di dinosaur di be di na le mafofa (The suggestion that many dinosaurs had feathers):** The passage discusses the prevalence of feathers, but it's not about *what* purpose those feathers served.



"
Ke’ng seo mafofa a di dinosaur a bego a se na sona?,"The correct answer is **C: Mafofa a magologolo (Feathers)**.

The passage states: ""Sebopego sa mafofa se šišinya gore a be a sa šomišwe go fofa efela bakeng sa kelo ya themphereitša goba go bonwa. **Yona ke go be go na le mafofa a magologolo**..."" (The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't solely used for display or temperature regulation. **The reason was that they had feathers**...). This implies that the feathers themselves were the key feature that was present, while other things weren't.  The passage goes on to describe *what* the feathers *did* (display, temperature regulation) and *how* they were structured.

"Go mafoko ao a latelago, ke lefe leo le sa bolelego nnete ka seokobatši sa ZMAPP?","The correct answer is **D: Dinyakišišo di bontšha gore mehola ya sona e tlase go feta ka mo go bego go naganwa mathomong.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dithuto di laeditše gore se na le mohola o monnyane go feta ka moo se nyakilego go thibela lehu."" (Studies showed that it has a smaller potency than needed to stop the bleeding.) This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Se dirilwe ka dilwantšha malwetši:** The passage doesn't mention the origin of ZMapp.
* **B: Se kgona go alafa malwetši ao a lego gona eupša e sego go thibela lehu:** The passage states it *failed* to stop the bleeding effectively.
* **C: Se šomile e le seokobatši sa taolo tekong ya PALM:** The passage explicitly says ""Go bolela gore boramahlale ba e šomišitše bjalo ka motheo gomma ba bapetša tše tharo tše dingwe go yona."" (It is stated that experts administered it as a control group and then tested three other drugs against it.) This means it *was* used as a control.

Therefore, only option D is directly and accurately supported by the text."
Ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago leo le hlalošago ka nepo teko ya PALM?,"The correct answer is **B: Seokobatši sa taolo se ile sa bapišwa le dikalafo tše dingwe tše tharo, e nngwe ya tšona e be e le ZMapp.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp performed similarly to the control, meaning experts administered it along with three other drugs.""  Option B directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dinyakišišo di bontšha gore e ka ba e na le mehola e mentši go feta ka mo go bego go naganwa mathomong:** While the passage mentions ZMapp's potency being lower than expected, it doesn't state that *research* shows it has more potency than originally thought.
*   **C: ZMapp e ile ya šomišwa e le kalafo ya mathomo:** The passage indicates ZMapp was compared to other drugs, *not* that it was the initial drug tested.
*   **D: E bontšhitše e kgona go alafa malwetši ao a bego a šetše a le gona:**  The passage focuses on ZMapp's efficacy against *future* infections, not its ability to cure existing ones.

This indicates the device is targeted at areas with limited resources.
"
Go tlo šomišwa mokgwa ofe go hlama thulusi ye ya go lemoga malwetši?,"The correct answer is **B: Diphrinthara tša Standard inkjet**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...chip yeo e ka dirwago go šomišwa di printer tša inkjet tša sente ye tee go U.S."" This means the tiny chip that detects diseases can be printed onto standard inkjet printers.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe la mabapi le mawa a ngweding leo e sego nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Ditiragalo tše di a bopilego di sa tšwa go direga e se kgale (The formations are not from a very old event)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the lunar scraps are ancient geological formations.  Option A directly contradicts this by saying the formations are *not* from a very old event. The passage implies they are very old, supporting the idea of ancient geological processes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go ba gona ga mawa ao go bontšha gore dilo tše di diragalelago lefase di diragalela le ngwedi (There are formations that show that the processes that formed the Earth also formed the Moon)**:  This aligns with the theory that the Moon and Earth share a common geological history.
* **C: A ka ba a bakilwe ke go šošobana ga ngwedi (They could be caused by the Moon colliding with another object)**: This is a possible explanation for the formation of the lunar scraps, and isn't contradicted by the passage.
* **D: Ga se gwa hwetšwa mawa a mantši kua ngweding (Not many formations are found on the Moon)**: The passage states that *many* formations *have* been found. This option is factually incorrect according to the text.



Therefore, **A** is the only statement that directly opposes the information provided in the passage."
"Go ya pego, ke thuto efe ya mabapi mawa ao yeo e laetšago gore se se diragalelago lefase se diragalela le ngwedi?","The correct answer is **B: Mawa ao a bopegile kgalekgale (Ancient rocks)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the moon's ""scraps"" are ancient and show signs of long-ago geological activity.  This suggests that the moon's geological processes are similar to those that occurred on Earth billions of years ago.  Therefore, the passage implies that the rocks found on the moon are ancient.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se ka se sa dirwago go fihlela go dirwa kahlolo?","The correct answer is **A: Go ntšha maikutlo a mangwe (To reveal other feelings)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go kgolegong go sa emetšwe kahlolo le tsheko, efela bohlatse bjo bongwe le bjo bongwe bja dihlatse bo ka tšhilafatšwa ka lebaka la gore seswantšho sa gagwe se phatlaladitšwe gohle."" This translates to: ""There is resentment at the delay in the trial and judgment, only other emotions of grief can be released because his footage has been published everywhere.""

The key is that the release of the footage is allowing for the *expression of grief* and *other feelings* related to the case. The passage implies that a full judgment cannot be reached until those feelings are processed and understood. Therefore, the focus isn't on *revealing other feelings* in the sense of publicizing news or other actions, but rather the internal processing of emotions that needs to happen before a conclusion can be reached.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go phatlalatša dinepe (To publish news):** The passage *already* mentions that the footage has been published.
* **C: Go boledišana ka bohlatse bja dihlatse tše di bonego ka mahlo (To share the grief witnessed firsthand):** While grief is a factor, the passage emphasizes the *release* of grief rather than the *sharing* of it in a public way.
* **D: Go gatišwa ga dingwalwa (To submit documents):** The passage doesn't mention documents or submissions.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng se gabjale e sego bothata go di-seal?","The correct answer is **A: Boemo bjo šoro bja leratadima (The loose, dry condition of the grains)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the rapid drying of the grains has made them brittle, making them difficult to process. It also mentions that the reason for the problem is the ""loose, dry condition"" of the grains, which has been the case for the past 15 years.  The question asks what *isn't* currently a problem with the seals.  The text implies the seals are the problem because the grain is brittle and hard to process due to its dryness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bontši bja aese (Most of the grains):** While there's a large quantity of grains, the *condition* of the grains is the problem, not necessarily the quantity.
*   **C: Bokoto bja aese (Grain infestation):** The text doesn't mention any grain infestation as a problem.
*   **D: Go tologa ga aese (Grain loss):** The text doesn't mention grain loss being a problem.



Therefore, the loose, dry condition of the grains is what is currently causing issues, and the question is asking what *isn't* causing issues."
"Go tlaleletša go aese, ke eng seo se šitišago maiteko a tlhakodišo?","The correct answer is **B: Maemo a leratadima (Poor weather conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""maemo a go tsenelela a boso a be a šitiša matshapa a go leka go phološa"" which translates to ""the weather conditions had hindered efforts to rescue him."" This directly links the weather conditions to the failure of the rescue attempts, indicating a poor/adverse weather situation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go hlaela ga ditlabela tša tlhakodišo (Failure of rescue plans):** While the rescue *didn't succeed*, the passage focuses on the *reason* for the failure – the weather.
* **C: Go hloka thušo (Lack of assistance):** The passage doesn't mention a lack of assistance.
* **D: Di-seal (Seals):** This is irrelevant to the situation described.

Therefore, **poor weather conditions** are the element that hindered the rescue efforts and are therefore the reason for the failed search.

Ke tumelo efe yeo Roberts a tšhabilego go e tiišetša?,"The correct answer is **B: Bohlokwa go se fetofetoge ga dikahlolo tša Kgorokgolo ya Tsheko (the importance of upholding Supreme Court precedent)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Roberts reiterated his earlier statement that Roe v. Wade was an ""established law of the nation"" and that he upheld the importance of the Supreme Court's precedent (the legal principle established by Roe v. Wade). He also acknowledged the right to privacy that Roe v. Wade was based on.  His focus was on maintaining the established legal framework.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tsela ya go sekaseka melato (the method of judicial review):** While judicial review is relevant to the discussion, the passage doesn't focus on the *method* of judicial review, but rather the *outcome* (upholding precedent).
*   **C: Mathomo a bophelo (the beginning of life):** While the right to privacy was based on the concept of the beginning of life, Roberts did not explicitly state that he believed in the beginning of life in the passage.
*   **D: Tokelo ya go ba le sephiri (the right to privacy):** Roberts acknowledged the right to privacy, but the core of what he was reiterating was the importance of the *established legal precedent* derived from Roe v. Wade, which *included* the right to privacy.



"
Ke taba efe yeo Roberts a bego a bona go se bohlokwa gore e ahlaahlwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Sephetho sa Roe Kgahlanong le Wade**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Roberts referred to *Roe v. Wade* as a ""vested constitutional right"" and that his statement was intended to ""block the importance of Supreme Court precedents of that nature.""  Therefore, he wanted to overturn or at least significantly weaken the precedent set by *Roe v. Wade*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go se fetofetoge ga dikahlolo tša Kgorokgolo ya Tsheko:** While Roberts's comments imply a desire to change legal precedent, the text specifically focuses on *Roe v. Wade*, not the broader trend of Supreme Court decisions.
*   **C: Tokelo ya go ba le sephiri:** The text acknowledges the ""right to privacy"" that *Roe v. Wade* was based on, but Roberts's aim was to *redefine* or limit that right, not necessarily abolish the concept of privacy itself.
*   **D: Ditabanatabana tša molato:** The passage does not mention abortion or moral considerations regarding fetal status.

The text states: ""Mahlasedi a mabedi a seetša a hlomilwe go lebiša go ya lefaufaung bošegong."" This translates to ""Two eggs were found inside the bird's nest.""
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, meago ye meteleletelele e tlo agiwa neng lefelong le?","The correct answer is **A: Mosegare wa sekgalela** (At midnight).

The text states: ""Dikago di sa tšwela pele go meago ye metelelelele ko tikologong, le lefelo la dinamelwa le phaka ya segopotšo **mogare**.""  ""Mogare"" means midnight. Therefore, the construction work will continue at midnight.
"
Ke tshedimošo efe e šišinyago gore The Seven Sisters ke mawa?,"The correct answer is **A: Phapano ya dithemphereitšha (Temperature variations)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Diswantšho tšeo di rometšwego di bontša gore diphapana tša boemo bja boso go tšwa bošegong le mosegareng di bontša gore di ka ba e le mawa.""  This translates to: ""The data sent shows that the differences in surface temperature between day and night indicate they could be volcanoes.""

While other factors might be relevant to volcanic activity, the *temperature variation* is the key indicator mentioned in the text.

Phišo ya Seven Sisters e bonwa bjang?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka dinyakišišo tša mawa mo Lefaseng**.

The text states: ""Diswantšho tšeo di rometšwego di bontša gore diphapana tša boemo bja boso go tšwa bošegong le mosegareng di bontša gore di ka ba e le mawa."" This translates to ""The data sent shows that the differences in brightness between day and night indicate that they may be planets."" The rest of the passage then elaborates on their behavior being similar to planets.

Option D is the most accurate because the text explicitly mentions that the observations suggest they are planets. The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe leo le sa bolelego nnete ka mogononelwa?","The correct answer is **A: O šomišitše koloi nakong ya tlhaselo (He drove a car during the attack)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the man is suspected of being an accomplice to the attack but *was* arrested. The passage does *not* mention him driving a car during the attack.  The other options are mentioned directly in the text:

* **B: Go thwe o thuthupišitše sethuthupi (He beat a suspect with a cane):** The text says he ""tswerwe"" (was arrested) after the attack and ""go tšwa dikgobalo go tšwa mothuthupong"" (accusations arose from the suspect).  This implies he may have been involved in the attack, including possibly using a cane.
* **C: Maphodisa a a tseba gore ke wa morafo ofe (The police knew what ethnicity he was):** The text explicitly states ""Leina la gagwe ga sahla le tsebewa ke bamolao, le ge e le gore ba a tseba gore ke moleloko wa sehlopa sa setšo sa Uighur"" (His name is known to the police, although they know he is of the Uyghur ethnic group).
* **D: O be a se a gobala (He had been robbed):** While the suspect might have been robbed, the passage doesn't state this.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that is *not* supported by the passage.



"
Ke ditaba dife ka tlhaselo tšeo maphodisa ba boletšego gore ke nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: Gore mogononelwa o šomišana le bomang (That the detainee had contact with women)**.

Here's why:

The prompt states: ""Go gononelwago go ba thuthupišitše sethuthupi o tswerwe, ka morago ga go ba le dikgobalo go tšwa mothuthupong."" (The detainee was detained after suspicion arose from the phone.)  The suspicion was due to phone calls.  The question asks what information the authorities have presented as true. The options list various details, and the prompt explicitly mentions phone calls as the reason for detainment. While options B, C, and D *might* be related to the investigation, the text directly confirms the contact with women as a factor leading to suspicion.
"
Ke dihlopha dife tšeo di tlogo bapala kua Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: South Africa le Australia**.

The text explicitly states: ""Papadi ya mafelelo ya tatelano e tla ralokwa go la Ellis Park ka Johannesburg beke ye etlago, ge di Springboks di raloka le Australia."" This translates to ""The final match of the tournament will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, when the Springboks play Australia.""
"
Sehlopha sa Springbok se tlo bapalela kae papadi ya sona ya go latela?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Papadi ya mafelelo ya tatelano e tla ralokwa go la Ellis Park ka Johannesburg beke ye etlago, ge di Springboks di raloka le Australia."" (The final match of the tournament will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, when the Springboks play Australia.)
"
Ke bothata bofe go mathata a latelago bjoo seteišene sa seyangweding se bilego le bjona nakong ya leeto?,"The correct answer is **B: Go boloka gyroscopo**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions that the gyroscope in the satellite's system was malfunctioning, causing it to spin uncontrollably. This malfunction is directly linked to the satellite's difficulty maintaining its orientation.  Therefore, the primary problem the satellite faced was related to stabilizing the gyroscope.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Go boloka seyangweding se le kgojana le sešušumetši (Maintaining the spacecraft free from disturbance):** While important, this is a general requirement for any spacecraft. The passage specifically highlights the gyroscope issue.
* **C: Go dira gore seyangweding se fofe ka lebelo (Making the spacecraft rotate as intended):**  This is the *result* of a functioning gyroscope, not the primary problem itself.
* **D: Go bušetša seyangweding boemong bja maleba bja go fofa (Adjusting the spacecraft's orientation in the attitude plane):**  Again, this is a consequence of the gyroscope's function.  The core issue is that the gyroscope isn't functioning correctly, preventing proper attitude adjustment.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, morero wa seteišene sa seyangweding e be e le ofe?","The correct answer is **C: Go fetša mosepele ya lefaufaung (To transport a spacecraft to orbit).**

Here's why:

The passage states that the spacecraft is successfully completing its maneuvers and reaching orbit. The initial part of the passage discusses the gyroscope's function in maintaining stability during the ascent, which is a critical phase in getting to orbit.  Therefore, the overarching goal of the mission was to get the spacecraft into orbit.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go hwetša khamphase ya go timela ya seyangweding (To determine the orbital parameters of the spacecraft):** While orbital parameters are important, the primary objective is the launch and placement *in* orbit. Determining those parameters is a result of successfully achieving orbit.
* **B: Go batamela kgauswi le sešušumetša seyangweding (To maneuver against and control the spacecraft):** Maneuvering is a *part* of reaching orbit, not the overall objective itself.
* **D: Go dira gore seyangweding se fofe ka lebelo (To make the spacecraft behave as expected):** While important for a successful mission, it's a general goal and doesn't define the specific objective of launching into orbit.



"
Ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago e sego nnete ka molato?,"The correct answer is **A: O sekilwe seleteng sa motsemošate wa AOL** (It was found in an AOL email).

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the *false* statement.** The passage states the law was discovered through a legal investigation using a ""legal subpoena"" (lekgotlatheramolao wo o thakgotšwego). 
* **Option A implies the discovery happened within an email itself.** While the legal investigation *may have* involved examining AOL emails, the passage doesn't explicitly say the law was *found* within an email. It was discovered *through* the investigation.
* **Options B, C, and D are all directly supported by the passage:**
    * **B: Kahlolo e ile ya dirwa (The investigation was conducted):**  The text explicitly mentions a legal investigation.
    * **C: Molao wa mabapi le di emeile tša bofora o ile wa šomišwa molatong wo (The law regarding spam emails was enacted):** The passage mentions the law was enacted in 2003.
    * **D: AOL e ile ya bonwa molato (AOL was found liable):** The passage states AOL was held responsible for failing to block spam.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that isn't directly supported by the information provided in the passage."
Ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago le hlalošago ka nepo molato wo?,"The best answer is **A: AOL e rwešitšwe molato wa go phatlalatša dilo ntle le go kgopelwa** (AOL was sued for unauthorized distribution of material).

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** ""Molato o hweditšwego ka 2003 go fokotša diimeile tše dintši, aka spam, gotšwa go baphatlalatši ba go se tsebege go ya ka gare ga mapokisi a bašomiši."" (A lawsuit was filed in 2003 to reduce a lot of emails, aka spam, from unauthorized senders getting into the inboxes of subscribers.)
* **This directly implies:** AOL was being sued *because* they were sending unwanted emails (spam) without permission.
* **Option A accurately summarizes this core reason for the lawsuit.**

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Molato o akaretša ditirelo tše pedi tša inthanete tša go tuma** (The lawsuit involved two internet services.)  While AOL is an internet service, the paragraph doesn't mention other services.
* **C: Molato o sekilwe ka 2003** (The lawsuit was filed in 2003.) This is true, but it doesn't explain *why* the lawsuit happened.  It's a detail, not the core reason.
* **D: AOL ke yona e butšego molato** (AOL filed the lawsuit.) This is incorrect; AOL *was* sued, not the other way around.



Therefore, **A** is the most comprehensive and accurate answer that explains the lawsuit based on the provided text."
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sehlopha sefe seo Vidal a ilego a thoma go se ralokela dihleng tše tharo tša go feta?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The question asks where Vidal started playing for the three teams before joining Barça. The text explicitly states: ""Vidal wa mengwaga ye 28 o tsenetše Barça ditlha tše tharo tša go feta, go tšwa go Sevilla."" which translates to ""Vidal, at 28 years old, joined Barça after three teams, starting from Sevilla.""
"
Vidal o ralokile dipapadi tše kae go Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Vidal o ralokile dipapadi tše 49 bakeng sa sehlopa."" which translates to ""Vidal has played 49 games for the club.""
"
Ke sehlopha sefe se ba bego ba raloka kgahlanong le sona?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text states: ""O be a dula hoteleng ya sehlopha pele ga papadi yeo e beakantšwego ya Sontaga kgahlanong le Bolonia."" This translates to ""He was staying in the team hotel before the match scheduled for Sunday against Bologna.""
"
Gore’ng Jarque a be a dula hoteleng?,"The correct answer is **B: O be a na le seboka sa pele ga sehla (He was ahead of the game).**

Here's why:

The sentence states Jarque was staying in the team hotel *before* the scheduled game on Sunday against Bologna.  This implies he was preparing and ""ahead of the game"" in terms of logistics and getting ready for the match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O be a itlwaetša (He was relaxing):** While he might have relaxed, the sentence emphasizes his presence *before* the game, not that he was simply relaxing.
* **C: O be a tlo raloka ka Sontaga (He was going to fly on Sunday):** The sentence says he was staying in the hotel *before* the Sunday game, not that he was traveling on that day.
* **D: O be a itlwaetša le Bolonia (He was preparing with Bologna):** The sentence doesn't suggest he was preparing *with* Bologna, but rather that he was preparing for the game *against* Bologna.



"
Ke ka baka la’ng mokgatlo wa geophysics wa Jakarta o se wa ntšha temošo?,"The correct answer is **D: Seemo se be se sa bontšhe go tlo ba le tšhišinyego (The seismograph did not show an earthquake)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that the geophysical institute of Jakarta said there was no earthquake of the necessary magnitude (6.5) to cause a tsunami.
* A seismograph is an instrument that detects earthquakes. 
* Therefore, the institute's conclusion was based on the lack of a significant seismic reading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go be go se na leswao la gore go ka ba le tsunami (There was no sign of a tsunami):** This is a consequence of the institute's finding, not the reason *why* they made that finding.
* **B: Ba be ba sa nyake go tšhoša badudi (They did not want to evacuate people):**  The primary concern of the institute is to accurately assess the risk, not to avoid evacuations.
* **C: Ba be ba sa nyake gore dikgwebo di amege gampe (They did not want businesses to be damaged):**  Similar to B, this is a consequence of the assessment, not the core reason behind it.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, tšhišinyego e ile ya baka eng?","The correct answer is **A: Badudi ba ile ba tšhoga.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go sa lebelelwe gore ga go na kgonagalo ya gore go be le tsunami, badudi ba thomile go tšhoga gomme ba thoma go tlogela dikgwebo le magae a bona.""  This directly translates to: ""It was not expected that there would be a tsunami, people started to panic and started evacuating businesses and homes.""

While the earthquake (magnitude 6.5) was the cause of the concern, the immediate reaction described is the panic of the people. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Ke dilo dife go tše di latelago tšeo di hlohleletšago ditiro tša letšatši le dinaledi tše dingwe ka moka?,"The correct answer is **D: Go phadima, nomoro ya Rossby, le modikologo.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ditiro tša dinaledi ka moka ka gare ga tshepedišo di hweditšwe go ba di šušumetšwa ke seetša sa tšona, go dukuloga ga tšona, go sego se sengwe. **Seetša le go retologa di šomišwa mmogo go laodiša palo ya naledi ya Rossby, yeo e amanago le kelo ya plasma.** Bonnyane bja nomoro ya Rossby, bonnyane bja naledi ya go ba le bophelo go le ka poetšomorago ya makenete.""

This translates to: ""The usual behavior of planets within a cycle was found to be influenced by their size, their rotation, or other things. **Size and rotation are combined to estimate the Rossby number, which is related to plasma density.** A small Rossby number, a small amount of life, is associated with magnetic pole reversals.""

Therefore, the factors influencing planetary and solar behavior are size (go phadima), the Rossby number (nomoro ya Rossby), and magnetic pole reversals (modikologo).



"
Nomoro ya dinaledi ya Rossby e hwetšwa bjang?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka palo ya go elela ga polasema**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Seetša le go retologa di šomišwa mmogo go laodiša palo ya naledi ya Rossby, yeo e amanago le kelo ya plasma.""  This translates to: ""The temperature and rotation are combined to determine the Rossby wave number, which is related to the plasma density.""

Therefore, the Rossby wave number is determined by the plasma density (kelo ya plasma).
"
Ke diperesente dife tša batho bao go boledišanwego le bona bao ba thekgago taba ya gore Australia e be republic le semeetseng?,"The correct answer is **D: Diperesente tše 34**.

The question asks what percentage of those surveyed *agreed* that Australia should become a republic. The text states: ""Diperesente tše 34 tša bao ba lego ka gare ga lenaneo la diboutu ba abelana le pono ye, go nyaka Queen Elizabeth II gore a be kgoši ya mafelelo ya Australia."" (34 percent of those in the survey shared this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the final monarch of Australia.)  This means 34% agreed that Australia *should* become a republic (even if they wanted the Queen to remain as the final monarch).
"
"Go ya le ka Julie Gillard, Australia e swanetše gore e be republic neng?","The correct answer is **B: Ka morago ga pušo ya Mohumagadi Elizabeth II**.

The text states: ""Mohlokomedi Tonakgolo Julia Gillard o boletše kampeng ya dikgetho tša mmušo tša 2010 gore o dumela gore Australia e tla ba rephapoliki mafelelong a pušo ya Kgošigadi Elizabeth wa bobedi."" (Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.)
"
Ke mokgatlo ofe wo o lego ka fase ga dinyakišišo tša molao?,"The correct answer is **D: The Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mokgahlo o tšere molao o moswa woo o sa dumelelego mphiwafela goba tefelelo gore e fiwe mekhalo yeo e lego ka fase ga ona... Molaotshepedišo wa Komen o emišitše Botswadi bjoo bo beakantšwego ka lebaka la dinyakišišo tšeo di letetšwego mabapi le gore Botswadi bjoo bo šomiša le go bega mašeleng a bjona bjang tšeo di dirwago ke Kemedi Cliff Stearns... Stearns o nyakišiša ge e ba di tax di šomišwa go lefela go ntša dimpa ka Planned Parenthood karolong ya gagwe bjalo ka modulasetulo wa Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee, yeo e lego ka fase ga kupetšo ya House Energy and Commerce Committee.""

This clearly indicates that Cliff Stearns is the head of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, and the foundation in question is being investigated *by* that subcommittee.  Therefore, the subcommittee is the entity that the legal investigation falls under.
"
Cliff Stearns ke hlogo ya komiti efe?,"The correct answer is **D: The Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee**.

The text states: ""Stearns o nyakišiša ge e ba di tax di šomišwa go lefela go ntša dimpa ka Planned Parenthood karolong ya gagwe bjalo ka modulasetulo wa **Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee**, yeo e lego ka fase ga kupetšo ya House Energy and Commerce Committee."" (Stearns claims that taxes were diverted to Planned Parenthood through his work as the chairman of the **Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee**, which is under the House Energy and Commerce Committee.)



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe seo se sa diragalelago mosadi wa Swiss?","The correct answer is **B: O bolailwe (Was kidnapped)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that five people were arrested for *kidnapping* a Swiss woman and finding her valuables and computer.
* The text *doesn't* say the woman was kidnapped. It implies she *was* kidnapped because of the arrest of those who allegedly committed the crime.

Let's look at the other options:

* **A: Dilo tše a di utsweditšwego di hweditšwe (The valuables were found)** - The text explicitly mentions finding her valuables.
* **C: O gobošitšwe ka tša thobalano ke batho ba 5 (She was held captive by 5 people)** - While implied by the kidnapping, the text doesn't directly state this.
* **D: Selefouno le khomphutha ya gagwe di utswitšwe (Her phone and computer were found)** - The text says her phone and computer were found.

Therefore, the only thing the text *doesn't* say is that the Swiss woman was kidnapped."
Ke khamphani efe yeo e filwego Sefoka sa go Ikemela sa Taiwan ka 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The question states: ""Efela maraka wa kgwebo wa khomphuthara o tla fapanywa kudu le go fetolwa ka morago ga ge ASUS e filwe sefoka ke Molekgotlaphethiši Yuan wa Rephapoliki ya China sa Sefoka sa Polokego sa Taiwan sa 2007."" This directly identifies ASUS as the company that received the award.
"
ASUS Eee PC ke’ng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ke lepothopo (It's a netbook)**.

The text explicitly states that the ASUS Eee PC ""hlomišitše lefase ka bophara bakeng sa dintlha tša tsenyagalelo-boloka le tšomišo"" which translates to ""revolutionized the world for portable computing and communication.""  This description aligns perfectly with the definition of a netbook.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ke selefouno ya sebjalebjale (It's a mobile phone):**  The text mentions computing and communication, not primarily phone functions.
* **C: Ke thabolete (It's a tablet):** While the Eee PC was a precursor to tablets, it wasn't a tablet itself. Tablets came later and had different form factors.
* **D: Ke sedirišwa sa go romela le go amogela melaetša (It's a device for sending and receiving mail):**  This is completely unrelated to the description provided.



"
Ke mang yo a bego a ikarabela ka go timela ga ditokomane tša poso?,"The correct answer is **A: Bašomi ba posong (Postal workers)**.

The text states that postal workers (bašomi ba posong) were overwhelmed by the volume of mail, specifically over 600 documents including 429 New Year's cards. This indicates they were responsible for handling the influx of mail.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mang yo a kgopetšego tshwarelo ka ditokomane tše di timetšego?","The correct answer is **D: Ba posong ya Obanazawa**.

The passage states: ""Kantoro ya diromelwa e lokolotše kgopelo ya tshwarelo go badudi le ba ditaba ka morago ga go hwetša gore lesogane le be le khutišitše ditokomane tša go romelwa tša go feta 600...""  This means the office in Obanazawa (Kantoro ya Diromelwa ya Obanazawa) discovered the problem. Therefore, the office in Obanazawa is responsible for the loss of the documents.
"
Del Potro o ile a swanelwa ke go lokiša neng bothata bja legetla la gagwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Nakong ya papadi ya bobedi**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""Potro o amogetše kalafo legetleng la gagwe nakong ye efela o kgonne go boela papading."" (Del Potro received his only fault during the second set, when he was able to return to the court.)

This directly indicates the fault occurred during the second set.
"
Dipoelo tša maikhutšo a mathomo e bile dife?,"The correct answer is **D: Papadi e fentšwe ke Del Potro go sete ya bobedi**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""Del Potro o bile le monyetla wa kapela seripeng sa bobedi, efela le se se nyakile khutšo morago ga go fihlelela 6-6.""  This means Del Potro won the second set after a tiebreak at 6-6.
"
"Bjalo ka ge go boletšwe karolong ye, ke mang yo ka go kgethega a bilego kgauswi le molwetši?","The correct answer is **B: Bana**.

The text states: ""Lehono, re hweditše gore bana ba sekolo ba go le mengwaga ya go feta ya go ba sekolong ba hweditšwe ba bile le kopano le molwetši."" This translates to: ""Recently, we found that some school children older than [a certain age] who were in school were found to have been in contact with a disease.""
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke kgonthišetšo efe yeo mmuši a sa kago a e dira ge a be a bolela le badudi ba Texas?","The correct answer is **A: Tshepetšo e šoma gabotse (The system works properly)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Netefaletšegang gore tshepedišo ya rena e šoma ka tswanelo."" which translates to ""Ensure that our system works properly."" The speaker is assuring the Texas audience that the safety system is functioning as it should.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dilo di a dirwa go šireletša badudi (Things are being done to protect people):** While implied, the primary focus of the quoted statement is the *system's* proper functioning, not the actions taken to protect people.
* **C: Ba itlhamile gabotse go swaragana le seemo (They are confidently using the language):**  This is irrelevant to the speaker's message. The question is about the *content* of their message, not their linguistic confidence.
* **D: Seemo ga se se sebe (The language is not real):** The language is clearly real; it's Setswana. This is a nonsensical option in the context of the question.



"
Ke lenaneo lefe la go ekišetša ditaba lefe leo le hlamilwego ke baithuti ba maloba ba UW?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kgale pele ga Swantšho ya The Daily le Pego ya The Colbert, Heck le Johnson ba bonetšepele phatlalatšo yeo e tla ekišago ditaba—le go bega ditaba—ge e be e le baithuti UW ka 1988. Go tloga mathomong, **The Onion** e bile mmušo wa nnete wa ditaba tša dikwero...""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: The Colbert Report** is mentioned as a show that Heck and Johnson *later* appeared on, not the one they started.
* **B: The Electoral College** is a part of the US political system, not a news program.
* **C: The Daily Show** is mentioned as a show that many former Onion writers went on to work for, but the question asks which program the UW students *started*.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se sa akaretšwago ka go mankekišane wa The Onion news empire?","The correct answer is **B: Filimi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions:

* **Wepesaete:** ""wepesete ye gogilego baeti ba 5,000,000...""
* **Kgatišo:** ""...kgatišo e lemanoga..."" and ""...netweke ya ditaba tša iri tše 24...""
* **Dipapatšo tša batho ka noši:** ""...dipapatšo tša batho ka noši...""
* **Our Dumb World (mmepe wa lefase):** ""...mmepe wa lefase wo o sa tšwago patlalatšwa wa go bitšwa Our Dumb World.""

The passage *doesn't* mention films as part of The Onion's empire. Therefore, **Filimi** is the correct missing element.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke’ng seo se bego se hlapeditšwe ke maphodisa?","The correct answer is **C: Matseno a Downing Street**.

The passage states that the police were responding to a bomb threat at Downing Street. The entire sequence of events described revolves around this threat.
"
Maphodisa a kgopetše baipelaetši ka nako mang gore ba tloge e le gore ba se bake sephetephete?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka 11:20**.

The text states: ""Ka 11:20, maphodisa a kgopetše bahlolampherefere gore ba boele morago godimo ga pabemente..."" which translates to ""At 11:20, police told pedestrians to go back above the pavement...""
"
Nnete ke efe ka nyakišišo ye e dirilwego ke Ngaka Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Magotlo a mangwe ao a bego a na le bolwetši bja swikiri a fodile.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Dr. Ehud Ur... ba lemošitše gore nyakišišo e sa le matšatšing a pele. Bjalo ka ditsebi tše dingwe, o gononwa gore ekaba diabetes e ka fodišwa, a bolela gore dikarabo tše ga di bolele ka batho bao ba šetšego ba na le Type 1 diabetes.""
* This means the research suggests that diabetes *could* be reversed in some individuals. The key is the phrase ""ekaba diabetes e ka fodišwa,"" indicating a reversal of the condition in some cases.
* The text also mentions that this isn't applicable to Type 1 diabetes, so option A is incorrect.
* Option C is not supported by the text. The research is about reversal, not finding a cure.
* Option D is incorrect because the research is about reversing diabetes in people *who already have it*, not about people who didn't have it initially.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo Ngaka Ur a thatafalelwago ke go se dumela?","The correct answer is **A: Ge e ba dipoelo di ka hola batho ba go swarwa ke bolwetši bja swikiri bja mohuta 1**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bjalo ka ditsebi tše dingwe, o gononwa gore ekaba diabetes e ka fodišwa, a bolela gore dikarabo tše ga di bolele ka batho bao ba šetšego ba na le Type 1 diabetes."" This translates to: ""Like other experts, he believes that diabetes can be cured, meaning that the solutions don't apply to people who have Type 1 diabetes.""  Therefore, Dr. Ur *doesn't believe* that diabetes can be cured in Type 1 diabetes patients.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ge e ba kalafo e ka hwetšagala:** The text doesn't discuss the possibility of a cure in general, just specifically for Type 1 diabetes.
*   **C: Dikakanyo tša ditsebi tše dingwe mabapi le kalafo:** While Dr. Ur is disagreeing with other experts, the question asks what *he* is not admitting. It's about *his* belief about a cure, not about agreeing or disagreeing with other opinions.
*   **D: Ge e ba magotlo ao a se nago bolwetši bja swikiri a tla dula a le bjalo:** The text doesn't say anything about the future of people who don't have diabetes. It focuses solely on Type 1 diabetes.



"
Ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago leo le sa hlalošeng ka nepo go pšhatlagana ga Sefofane sa CG4684?,"The correct answer is **A: Mathomong sefofane se paletšwe ke go tsokama ka baka la boemo bja leratadima** (Initially, the aircraft was forced to land due to the weather conditions).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Go nyaka goo go thibetšwe ke boemo bja boso ba go se be gabotse bona boo bo dirilego gore go ema go kgaotšwe."" (The attempt was stopped by the unfavorable weather conditions that made it unsafe to land.)

The question asks what *caused* the aircraft to have trouble landing. The text then provides details about the weather and the failed landing attempts. The phrase ""Mathomong sefofane se paletšwe ke go tsokama ka baka la boemo bja leratadima"" reflects the initial reason for the problems - the weather.  The other options don't align with the information provided.
"
Ke eng seo se dirilego gore Sefofane sa CG4684 se tlogele go kotama?,"The correct answer is **A: Lefelo la go kotama le be le sa fihlelelege (The landing approach was not reached)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Metsotso ye e ka bago ye lesome pele ga ge e swanetše go ema go tšwa go patamelong ya yona ya bobedi e ile ya timelela."" This translates to ""The minutes before the expected landing were exhausted.""  Then it says, ""Lefelo la thulano le hweditšwe lehono..."" (""The landing approach was found late..."").  This indicates the aircraft didn't make it to the final approach point in time.  The text also mentions that pilots had to avoid a dangerous area due to the aircraft's instability. This strongly points to a problem during the approach itself, not something that happened on the ground or due to weather.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Go be go na le difofane tše dingwe tše mmalwa ka pele ga CG4684 (There were several other aircraft ahead of CG464)**: While congestion *could* be a factor, the text doesn't mention it. The focus is on the landing approach.
* **C: Sefofane se ile sa arošetšwa Kokoda (The aircraft crashed in Kokoda)**: The text says the aircraft *landed* (or attempted to land) but didn't make it.  It doesn't say it crashed.
* **D: Maemo a leratadima e be e le a mabe (The weather conditions were bad)**: While weather *can* cause landing problems, the text doesn't specifically mention bad weather as the cause. The issue seems to be related to the landing approach itself.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago leo le bolelago nnete ka ga Franciszek Kowal?","The correct answer is **C: O robile setulo ge a be a leka go tšwa** (He fell on the seat while trying to get up).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Batho ba be ba betha ditšhipi tša mafesetere ka ditulo, efela mafesetere a be a sa thubege. Ye tee ya di pheini e robegile, gomme di thomile go tšwa ka lefesetere,"" which translates to ""People were putting safety pins on the suitcases, but the suitcases weren't opening. That handle became broken, and it started to come off.""
* Franciszek Kowal then says, ""Ka mahlatse ga go seo se ndiragetšego, efela ke bone tiragalo ya go tšhoša kudu, ge batho ba leka go thuba mafesetere gore ba kgone go tšwa.""  This means ""It's a shame about what happened, but I saw a lot of struggle as people tried to get the suitcases open so they could get out.""  
* Therefore, the logical conclusion is that he struggled *while trying to get up* (ge a be a leka go tšwa) because the suitcases weren't opening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O kgonne go thuba lefasetere** (He could have fallen on the ground) - The passage doesn't mention falling on the ground.
* **B: Ga se a gobale** (He didn't break) - The passage explicitly states the *handle* broke.
* **D: O gobetše ge a be a leka go thuba lefasetere** (He fell while trying to get up on the ground) - The passage doesn't mention falling on the ground.

Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately reflects the situation described in the passage, focusing on the struggle while trying to open the suitcases to get out.



"
Ke ka baka la’ng go le thata go akanyetša tshenyo ya Ledimo la Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Ledimo le kgole kudu le naga (The storm is very large and far away)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bjale ka ge ledimo le le kgole le go wela fase, go dula go le thata go lekola tshenyo ye e ka bago gona go United States goba Caribbean."" (But since the storm is very large and moving offshore, it is difficult to estimate the impact that may occur in the United States or the Caribbean.)

The key reason for the difficulty is the storm's size and distance.  A large storm moving far offshore makes it harder to predict its exact path and intensity, thus making impact predictions difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ledimo le bonwe le matlafala go ba ledimo le maatla (The storm is becoming a stronger storm):** While the storm *is* expected to strengthen, that's not the primary reason it's hard to predict its impact *now*.
* **B: Boramahlale ga ba na bonnete ka ga diphefo tša ledimo (Experts are not sure about the storm's trajectory):**  The passage doesn't state this. Experts likely have some idea of the trajectory.
* **D: Ledimo le kgole kudu le Miami (The storm is very large and near Miami):** The passage explicitly says the storm is *moving offshore* away from Miami.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, go mafoko ao a latelago ke lefe leo le sa bolelego nnete ka Ledimo la Danielle?","The correct answer is **D: Le kgauswi le naga (It is away from land)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ledimo, le lego bokgole bjo e ka bago di mile tše 3000 go tšwa Miami, Florida..."" (The storm, which is a tropical cyclone about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida...). This clearly indicates it's far offshore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ditlamorago tša lona Caribbean ga di tsebje (Its later stages in the Caribbean are unknown):** The passage says it *may* become a tropical storm on Monday, suggesting it *could* potentially affect the Caribbean.
* **B: Le hlolegile Lewatleng la Atlantic (It is in the Atlantic Ocean):** The passage states it's ""lego bokgole bjo e ka bago di mile tše 3000 go tšwa Miami, Florida"" which definitively places it in the Atlantic.
* **C: Le ka fetoga ledimo le maatla (It can become a hurricane):** The passage quotes the National Hurricane Center saying ""Danielle e tla matlafala go ya go ba ledimo la pula ya matlakadibe ka Laboraro"" (Danielle is expected to intensify into a tropical storm by Monday), implying it *can* become a hurricane.



Therefore, the only statement that is directly contradicted by the passage is that the storm is close to land.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, go šišingwa gore go dirwe’ng ka bolwetši pele bo ka aparela lefase?","The correct answer is **A: Bo swanetše go fokotšwa bogale** (It should be contained early).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the risk of the H5N1 avian flu spreading globally. It states that the virus has already spread to chickens in Turkey and that there's a possibility of people getting infected even without showing symptoms.  Therefore, the most logical course of action to prevent global spread is to contain the outbreak *early*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dika tša bjona di šwanetše go ba tše nnyane** (Their size should be smaller) - This refers to the virus itself, and the passage doesn't discuss its size.
* **C: Bo swanetše go fetela batho ba bantši** (It should infect many people) - This is the opposite of what's desired.  The goal is to *prevent* widespread infection.
* **D: Bana ba swanetše go ba le maswao a bjona** (Children should have its symptoms) -  The passage warns against this, stating that people can spread the virus even without symptoms.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ledimo le be le le bokgole bjo bokaakang go tloga Fujian?","The correct answer is **D: Dikhilomithara tše 77**.

The text states: ""Ledimo le maatla le letetšwe go šutela go leba China ka kph ya lesometee. **Go tloga profenseng ya China ya Fujian.**""  And also: ""Go tloga ka la bošego bja Agostose 9, leihlo la Morakot le be le le dikilomitara tše masomešupa **go tloga profenseng ya China ya Fujian**.""  ""Masomešupa"" means seventy. Therefore, it travelled 77 kilometers from Fujian.
"
Ke mang yo a dumedišitšego George W. Bush ge a se no fihla Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng le Lee Hsein Loong**.

The text states: ""O dumedišwetše ke Motlatša Tonakgolo Wong Kan Seng gomme a sekaseka ditaba tša go gwebišana le botšhošetše le Tona-kgolo ya Singapore lee Hsien Loong."" This translates to: ""He was received by Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and discussed cooperation and security issues with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.""
"
Mopresidente o boletše neng ka kgolo ya tša kgwebo Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka morago ga go loba dikgethong tša magareng.**

The passage states: ""Ka morago ga beke ya go palelwa go dikgetho tša gare ga sehla, Bush o ile a botša bateeletši ka ga godišo ya go rekišetšana go la Asia."" (After a week of the election results, Bush addressed reporters about the state of trade in Asia.)

Therefore, he spoke about it *after* the election results.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, maikemišetšo a mmušo ke afe go ao a latelago?","The correct answer is **B: Ba hwetše dikarikana tša go lekana 300**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tlaleletšo ya 300 e tliša palomoka go materokisi a 1,300 ao a swanetšwego go hwetšwa go imulla go pitlagana."" This translates to: ""The report indicates that 300 [items] have been recovered from 1,300 [items] that are supposed to be recovered to replenish the supply.""

Therefore, the government has recovered 300 items. Options C and D are incorrect because the passage doesn't say they found the other 1,300 items or reduced the amount needed. Option A is incorrect because it's about the general commitment of the government, not the specific action mentioned in the passage.
"
Ke’ng seo mmušo o se tsebišitšego?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba rulaganya go thekga ka mašeleng dikarikana tše dingwe tše 300**

Here's why:

* The question asks what the government *learned*. The passage states that the government's initiative to support traders during the annual market was undermined by a lack of resources. The solution they *learned* was to deploy an additional 300 personnel to assist.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba ikemišeditše go fediša bothata bja dikarikana:**  The passage doesn't say they planned to solve the problem entirely. It only mentions a response.
* **C: Ba rulaganya go thekga ka mašeleng dikarikana tše 1,300:** The passage says they deployed *additional* personnel, not all 1,300.
* **D: Bothata bja pitlagano bo tla ba bo rarollotšwe ka Matšhe:** The passage implies the problem wasn't going to be solved by the market itself, but that there was a resource shortfall.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke tshedimošo efe yeo e tsebjago?","The correct answer is **A: Tekanyo ya kotsi e fokoditšwe**.

Here's why:

The statement says: ""go fokotšega ga tšhošetšo ya maemo go ya go bo šoro..."" which translates to ""the reduction of the risk assessment due to the event...""  This directly indicates that the level of risk has decreased.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ga go sa na kotsi** (There is no risk): The statement implies a *reduction* in risk, not the absence of risk.
* **C: Go letetšwe go hlaselwa** (The attack was prevented): While the attack might have been prevented, the primary focus of the sentence is on the risk assessment.
* **D: Ditsebi di netefaditše gore tlhaselo e tlo ba e šoro** (Experts confirmed the attack would be successful): This is the opposite of what the statement says; it says the risk *decreased* because of the event.



"
Ke lefoko lefe leo le sa bolelego nnete ka boipelaetšo?,"The correct answer is **A: Khomišene ya mopresidente ke yona sebaki sa boipelaetšo (The President's commission is the place of legitimacy)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states the President's commission *issued instructions* for the CEP's autonomy.** This implies the commission *granted* legitimacy, rather than *being* the place of legitimacy. 
* **The other options are directly supported by the text:**
    * **B: Dikgetho tša go tšea nako e telele ke tšona di bakilego boipelaetšo (Long-delayed elections caused legitimacy issues):** The text explicitly says the commission was formed *due to concerns* about legitimacy stemming from issues that started in October.
    * **C: Baipelaetši ba nyaka gore CEP a itokolle mošomong (Stakeholders want CEP to be autonomous):**  The text mentions the President's directive to grant autonomy to the CEP as part of a strategy to address legitimacy concerns. This suggests stakeholder desire for autonomy.
    * **D: Ka dinako tše dingwe boipelaetši bo ba le bošoro (At other times, stakeholders have been fearful):**  The text refers to past concerns about elections being cancelled, indicating stakeholder fear.



Therefore, option A is the statement that is *not* directly supported by the text and thus is the answer.



"
Ke mang yo šišintšego gore CEP ya mafelelo e itokolle mošomong?,"The correct answer is **A: Ke Martelly**.

The text states: ""Komišini e be e le karabelo ya Martelly go dikgaruru kgahlanong le mmušo tša go tlala tšeo di thomilego ka Ocktobere."" (The commission was a response from Martelly to the criticisms regarding the government's handling of the protests that started in October.)  This directly indicates that Martelly initiated the decision for the CEP to be dissolved.

"Go ya ka mantšu a, ke eng seo USA Gymnastics e sa se thekgego go latela go se swarwe gabotse ga babapadi ke Nassar?","The correct answer is **D: Dinyakišišo tšeo di ikemego yeo e ka tlišago lesedi ka moo tlaišo ya kabelano yeo e hlaloswago ka sebete ke baphologi ba Larry Nassar e ka be e ile ya se bonwe lebaka le le telele gomme e godiša diphetogo tše dingwe le tše dingwe tšeo dihlokegago tša maleba.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that USA Gymnastics supports the findings of independent investigations into the abuse by Larry Nassar. It also mentions that this independent investigation could shed light on how the abuse went unnoticed for so long and led to other necessary changes. The passage *doesn't* say they support the failure to properly handle the abuse, the need to evaluate athlete safety, or the need for organizational changes. They support the *independent findings* that revealed the extent of the abuse.



"
"Go ya ka mantšu a, maikemišetšo a USA Gymnastics le United States Olympic Committee ke afe go ya pele?","The correct answer is **C: Go tiiša taba ya dinyakišišo tše di ikemego.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dijimenastiki tša USA di thekga nyakišišo yeo e ikemego yeo e ka tlišago lesedi ka moo tlaišo ya kabelano yeo e hlaloswago ka sebete ke baphologi ba Larry Nassar e ka be e ile ya se bonwe lebaka le le telele..."" (USA Gymnastics supports the findings of the independent investigation that could shed light on where the abuse by Larry Nassar was hidden...).

While the other options might be *results* of that commitment, the core commitment itself is to support independent findings and accountability. The passage emphasizes the need to address the abuse and learn from it.
"
Sekepe se be se lebile kae ge kotsi e direga? ,"The correct answer is **D: Japan**.

The passage states the ship was heading to Puerto Princesa *on the way to* Palawan and was then diverted to Sasebo, Nagasaki in Japan. Therefore, Japan is where the ship ultimately ended up after the incident.
"
Ke’ng seo e sego nnete ka sekepe seo go boletšwego ka sona mo?,"The correct answer is **A: Se be se lebile Puerto Princesa**.

The text states the ship was going *to* Puerto Princesa, but it was redirected. The text clearly states it was sent to Sasebo, Nagasaki in Japan. Therefore, it did not reach Puerto Princesa.
"
Ke mang yo a boletšego mabapi le mašole a US?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The question states that Donald Trump made the statement about US troops leaving Syria.
"
"Go ya ka mantšu a, ke naga efe e tšerego maikarabelo a go hlapetša mašole a mathopša?","The correct answer is **B: Europe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""dinaga tša Yuropa di ganne go gogela morago."" This translates to ""European countries are keen to return."" This indicates that European countries are the ones wanting the schools to leave, causing the pressure for the withdrawal.
"
Ke eng se go dumelwago gore se bakile kotsi?,"The correct answer is **B: Mollo wa go laolege (Lightning)**.

The text states: ""Thulano e diregile godimo mebotong ya ditaba, gomme go dumelwa gore e bile poelo ya mollo o šoro.""  This translates to: ""The fire started in the news reports, and it is believed that it was caused by lightning.""

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
Kotsi e hlagile seemong sa mohuta mang sa naga?,"The correct answer is **A: Se sešoro (A landslide)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Thulano e diregile godimo mebotong ya ditaba, gomme go dumelwa gore e bile poelo ya mollo o šoro."" which translates to ""A landslide occurred on the mountains, and it is believed that it was a mudslide.""

Therefore, the landslide occurred in a **sešoro** (mountainous) area.
"
Ke’ng se ba mmušo ba se holofelago ka baka la mafula?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsošološwa ga mekgobo ya santa (The return of the humpback whale)**.

The passage states: ""...ba holofela gore a tla lekana go boetša santa yeo e gogoletšwego moelong wa noka."" This translates to ""...they expect it to be enough to see the humpback whale that was led to the river.""  The expectation is for the humpback whales to return.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go hlamega ga mabopo (The recovery of salmon):** While salmon recovery is mentioned as a positive outcome, it's not the primary expectation or the main point of the passage.
* **C: Go oketšega ga dihlapi tše di bitšwago humpback chubs (The recovery of fish called humpback chubs):**  The passage mentions humpback chubs, but their recovery isn't the central expectation.
* **D: Go oketšega ga mafulo a diphoofolo tša nageng (The recovery of wildlife):** This is too broad. The passage focuses specifically on the return of the humpback whales.



"
Ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se amilwego sa ruri ke go agwa ga letamo?,"The correct answer is **B: Hlapi ya Humpback chubs**.

Here's why:

The text states that after the dam was built, two species of plants thrived and two became endangered, including the humpback chub. Therefore, the decline in the humpback chub population is a direct consequence mentioned in the text regarding the impact of the dam.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mekgobo ya disanta (Whale migration):** While the text mentions that the river used to attract whales, it doesn't say that whale migration is a *result* of the dam.
*   **C: Madulo a diphoofolo tša nageng (Habitat of native animals):** The text mentions habitat changes but doesn't link the dam directly to the habitat of *all* native animals. The focus is on the endangered status of the humpback chub.
*   **D: Go phatlalala ga digogolwa (Fish spawning):** The text states that fish spawning was affected, but it focuses specifically on the humpback chub as an example of a species impacted by the dam.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mang yo a tsebišitšego ditsebi tša United States tša dikhomphutha ka kgonagalo ya go hlaselwa?","The correct answer is **A: Masomalia a go fišegela thoko**. 

The passage states: ""Ngwako wa botseta bja United States go la Nairobi, Kenya o ntšitše temošo ya gore """"""marabele go tšwa Somalia"""""""" a beakanya...""  This indicates the US received intelligence *from* Somalia.
"
Ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago le hlalošago ka nepo tsela yeo bafišegela thoko ba bego ba tlo hlasela ka yona?,"The correct answer is **C: Go thuthupiša dipomo mafelong a go tuma dinageng tše pedi**.

Here's why:

* The text states the U.S. received intelligence about pirates planning to attack ""shipping lanes"" to Ethiopia **and** Kenya. 
* Option C accurately reflects this by saying the pirates were planning to attack shipping lanes in **two** countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go thuthupiša dipomo mafelong a go tuma nageng e tee** (Attacking shipping lanes in one country): The text specifies two countries (Kenya and Ethiopia).
* **B: Go thuthupiša dipomo dinageng tše pedi** (Attacking shipping lanes in two countries): This is close, but it doesn't specify that the shipping lanes are in specific countries (Kenya and Ethiopia).
* **D: Go thuthupiša dipomo nageng e tee** (Attacking shipping lanes in one country):  Again, the text specifies two countries.



"
Ke mang gare ga batho ba ba latelago yo e sego ramolao?,"The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

The text explicitly states: ""Petros Mantouvalos, a Member of Parliament and commentator, was dismissed from his office and implicated in illegal activities.""
"
Ke sehlopha sefe sa batho seo go sa bolelwego gore ke karolo ya bohwirihwiri ka gare ga motse wa molao wa Greek?,"The correct answer is **A: Bakgopedi ba ditšhelete (Financial advisors)**.

The text explicitly states that financial advisors (""bakgopedi ba ditšhelete"") are among those who have been investigated for illegal activities. The other options (journalists, journalists, and lawyers) are also mentioned as being investigated.

Therefore, the answer is A.
"
India e lahlegetšwe ke diwikhete tše kae?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The question states: ""Moabi wa gare, Sachin Tendulkar le Rahul Dravid, ba šomile gabotse le go dira boleloko bja gokitima ga lekgolo. Efela, ka morago ga go lahlegelwa ke wekete ya mokapoteni India e kitimile ga 36 fela ya lahlegelwa ke diwekete tše 7 go fetša go tsena goo."" This translates to: ""The middle order batsmen, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, had a good partnership and created a good record of milestones. But, after being dismissed by the Indian captain's wicket that was topped at 36 only was dismissed by 7 wickets to enter there.""  It clearly says they were dismissed by **7** wickets.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, nno ya go di feta e bile efe?","The correct answer is **B: Mekitimo e 36**.

The question states: ""Sachin Tendulkar le Rahul Dravid, ba šomile gabotse le go dira boleloko bja gokitima ga lekgolo. Efela, ka morago ga go lahlegelwa ke wekete ya mokapoteni India e kitimile ga 36 fela ya lahlegelwa ke diwekete tše 7 go fetša go tsena goo."" This translates to: ""Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, had a great partnership and made a record of great achievement. However, after being dismissed by the Indian captain's wicket, only 36 was dismissed in 7 balls to get in.""

Therefore, the number of runs scored before being dismissed is 36.
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo e sego lebaka la go ferekana ga Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **A: Molao o moswa wa wepesaete mabapi le dilo tša thobalano**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go šišimišega ga setšhaba go išitše go matsapa a bjale a go ngwala molao ka ga dikagare tša thobalano bakeng sa saete yeo e tšwara mekero ya ditaba ye dimilion-milion ya dilaesentse tša go bulega."" This translates to: ""Public outrage has escalated to calls to legislate on the terms of a website that hosts millions of news articles licensed for reuse.""

The passage specifically mentions that the outrage led to calls for **legislation on the website's terms of use.** This is directly linked to the controversy surrounding Adam Cuerden.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tlošwa ga bokgabo bja Wales** - While Wales is mentioned, the passage doesn't say that his ""releasing his secret"" is the reason for the controversy.
* **C: Ga se theetšwe ke Wales** - The passage *does* mention Wales and his actions.
* **D: Maaka mabapi le lebaka la go tlošwa ga bokgabo** - The passage focuses on the *legal* implications and calls for legislation, not just the release of information itself.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se tlošitšwego wepesaeteng?","The correct answer is **A: Bokgabo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Go fihla thwii go phumuleng ga gagwe ga bokgabo."" which translates to ""It took two weeks for his suspension to end.""
"
"Go ya karolo ye, ke selo sefe seo go tše di latelago seo Amir Khan a sa se thekgego?","The correct answer is **A: Go akaretša basadi ba go lwa ka gare ga diolimpiki** (Including women in boxing at the Olympics).

The passage explicitly states that Amir Khan *didn't* think women should box. He later said he would support British boxers at the 2012 London Olympics, implying he *would* support them, but the initial statement was about his opposition to women boxing at the Olympics.
"
"Go ya karolo ye, ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo Amir Khan a tlago go se thekga go sa šetšwe se yena a se naganago?","The correct answer is **C: Diolimpiki tša 2012**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go sa lebelelwe dipolelo tša gagwe o boletše gore o tla ba a thekga baphadišani ba British go Mabelo a 2012 ao a swarelwago London.""  This translates to: ""Despite his earlier comments, he said he would support the British athletes in the 2012 Olympics held in London.""

Therefore, he's going to support the athletes in the **2012 Olympics**.
"
Peter Lenz o hlokofetše neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka morago ga go wa paesekeleng ya gagwe** (After his motorcycle crashed).

The text states: ""Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, crashed after a spill at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.""  The rest of the text details the events *following* the crash.
"
Xavier Zayat ke mang?,"The correct answer is **B: Yo mongwe wa bakitimi** (He is another racer).

The text states that Peter Lenz crashed into Xavier Zayat during a race. This indicates that Xavier Zayat was also a racer.
"
Ke maemong afe moo go nago le kgonagalo ya gore mofofiši wa go tšhoga a holwe ke tsebo ya gagwe ya dikagare tša sefofane?,"The correct answer is **A: Ge e ba monamedi a swabiša ke letšhogo la gagwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding how a snake works and what happens when it sheds can help overcome fear of the unknown. Option A directly aligns with this: when a snake sheds, it's often due to a feeling of being threatened or stressed (swabiša ke letšhogo la gagwe). Understanding this biological process can demystify the shedding and lessen the fear associated with it.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Ge e ba tsebo ya gagwe ya go fofiša e dikologilwe ke go tšhoga dilo tše di sa tsebjego:** While encountering unexpected things can be challenging, it doesn't inherently relate to understanding a snake's shedding process and overcoming fear.
*   **C: Ge e ba monamedi a sa rate dinamelwa ka moka:**  A dislike of being touched has no direct connection to understanding snake shedding.
*   **D: Ge e ba go tšhoga ga gagwe go bakwa ke ditiragalo tše bohloko tše di sa amanego le go fofa:** Fear caused by unrelated traumatic events would not necessarily be addressed by understanding a snake's shedding.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate response based on the information provided in the passage.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo moeti wa go ba šedi ka diporaese a swanetšego go se dira mafelelong?","The correct answer is **D: Go lebelela diwepesaete tša difofane (To check airplane websites)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that before traveling by plane, it's important to check airplane websites to see if there are any differences in amenities or to get information about the airline.  The question asks what a travel agent should do *before* traveling, and checking airline websites is directly mentioned as a necessary step.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go nyaka mehola ya dikhamphani tša go tšea maeto ka bontši (To obtain insurance from multiple travel companies):** While insurance is important, the passage doesn't mention it.
* **B: Go beeletša sefofane thwii go ba difofane (To charter two planes to be private planes):** This is completely unrelated to the information in the passage.
* **C: Go bapetša diporaese magareng ga dikhamphani tša go sepela ka bontši (To book transfers between multiple travel companies):**  The passage doesn't mention transfers.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, batšea maeto ba swanetše go dira eng pele gore ba hwetše diporaese tša fasefase?","The correct answer is **A: Go lebelela diwepesaete tša difofane (To check the airline websites)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...go lebelela wepesaete ya lekala la sefofane pele ga ge o beela ka thoko."" ( ...to check the airline's website before you travel.) This is the key instruction provided.

The other options are not mentioned or implied in the passage.
"
Mothuši o nyakega neng ge go felegetšwa morwalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ge dilo di romelwa ka sefofane (When things are sent by courier)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ge ba ka romela dilo ka sefofane, ka ditsela tše dingwe e ka be e tšere matšatši go fihla mo go fološwago le ka moo merwalo e hlolwago.""  This means when items are sent by courier (which is a common method of shipping), there's a risk of delays and issues with customs/inspection.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ge khamphani e šomiša difofane tša yona (When the company uses its own couriers):**  The passage mentions large companies might have their own couriers, but it focuses on the *general* problem with courier services.
* **C: Ge dilo di romelwa e le merwalo yeo e lekotšwego (When things are sent as declared goods):** The passage talks about the issue of *inspection* of goods, not specifically about them being declared.
* **D: Ge dilo di romelwa ke khamphani ye kgolwanyane (When things are sent by a small company):** The passage mentions small companies *might* have delays, but the general problem is with the shipping method itself.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ge o kgetha lekala la gago la difofane la go Fofa Gantši go tša mohlakanelwa, ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago se o swanetšego go se etiša pele?","The correct answer is **B: Sefofane sa ka gare ga mokgatlo o mogolo (A larger-bodied bird)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that swans choose nests based on the *types* of different birds that compete for them, and that factors influencing nesting are found *below* the nest.  This implies that the size of the bird that chooses the nest is a significant factor. A larger-bodied bird would likely require a larger nest.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Sefofane sa go fana ka dintlha tše dintši (A bird that provides many materials):** While material availability is important for nest building, the passage emphasizes *competition* and the type of bird choosing the nest, not the materials it brings.
* **C: Sefofane seo o sepelago ka sona gantši (The bird you see most often):**  Frequency of seeing a bird doesn't necessarily correlate with its nesting habits or the suitability of a nest.
* **D: Sefofane sa go ka ba se go okeletša mehola (A bird that reaches the highest branches):**  Nest location (high branches) isn't the primary focus of the passage. The emphasis is on nest *choice* and the competing birds.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mang yo a ka fanago ka dintlha tša go fofa gantši ka sefofane?","The correct answer is **D: Sefofane se sengwe sa ka fase gare ga mokgatlo o swanago** (Another swan that is in the same habitat).

Here's why:

The passage states that a swan can choose a nesting site based on various factors *found at the bottom of the habitat*. This implies the swan is looking for other swans already present in that specific environment.  Options B and C are incorrect because they specify a swan that nests in a *different* habitat or one that is nesting *elsewhere* in the same habitat - the passage suggests a preference for a *shared* habitat. Option A is too general.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sekwi sefe go tše di latelago seo se ka golofatšwago ke go nwa bjala kudu?","The correct answer is **A: Go kwa**.

Here's why:

The text states that consuming improperly fermented sorghum can lead to serious problems, including blindness and death.  The phrase ""Go kwa"" in Setswana means ""to get drunk"" or ""to drink excessively"".  Excessive consumption is a key factor in the dangers associated with improperly fermented sorghum.

The other options don't fit the context:

* **Go bona:** To see
* **Go tatso:** To taste
* **Go dupa:** To jump
"
"Bjalo ka ge go boletšwe go karolo ye, ke eng seo se ka fokotšago ditlamorago tše kotsi tša bjala?","The correct answer is **C: Go nwa bjala ka go lekanyetša (Drinking bushmeat in moderation)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the risk of illness from bushmeat is often associated with consuming it in an illegal or unsafe manner.
* It specifically mentions methanol as a dangerous contaminant, especially when consumed in small quantities.
* **Drinking bushmeat in moderation** implies avoiding excessive consumption, which reduces the likelihood of encountering dangerous contaminants like methanol in high concentrations. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go nwa bjala gotee le methanol (Drinking bushmeat with methanol):** This is the *opposite* of what would reduce risk. It's a dangerous combination.
* **B: Go nwa dipiriti tša go se be molaong (Drinking illegal liquor):** While illegal liquor can be dangerous, the text focuses specifically on the risks associated with *bushmeat* and its contaminants.
* **D: Go nwa le batho ba go fapana (Drinking with different people):** The company you keep doesn't inherently reduce the risk of illness from bushmeat consumption.



"
Ke kae mo boleng bja thoto gare ga Amsterdam bo lego godimo?,"The correct answer is **A: The Canal District**.

The text explicitly states: ""Selete ka moka se betšwe bjalo ka **Lefelo la Bohwa bja Lefase la UNESCO bakeng sa setšo sa go ikgetha le boleng bja histori tša lona, gomme boleng bja thoto ba yona ke bo bongwe ba goba godimo ka nageng.**""  This translates to: ""It is mainly designated as a **UNESCO World Heritage Site for its exceptional universal value and historical integrity, and its cultural significance is among the highest in the country.**""

The Canal District is the subject being described as having exceptional cultural significance.
"
Ke ka baka la eng Canal District e kgethilwe gore e be Lefelo la Bohwa bja Lefase la UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka baka la boleng bja histori le setšo**.

The text states: ""Selete ka moka se betšwe bjalo ka Lefelo la Bohwa bja Lefase la UNESCO bakeng sa setšo sa go ikgetha le boleng bja histori tša lona...""  This directly translates to: ""The main reason it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site is for its unique image and the quality of its history...""
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe go dilo tše di latelago seo se dirago gore motho a se itshole ge a etetše Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **A: Go boga naga o le godimo ga Tonle Sap**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tikologo ye botse ya tempele le pono go tšwa godimo ga letsha la Tonle Sap di dira gore go namela go ya mmotong go be ga go se senye nako.""  This translates to: ""The beautiful view of the temple and the panorama from above the Tonle Sap lake makes the trip to the temple worthwhile.""

Therefore, the view *from above Tonle Sap* is what makes the trip worthwhile and motivates people to visit Phnom Krom. The other options are either prerequisites (Angkor Pass), general location (Siem Reap), or a mode of transport (boat trip) but not the *reason* people go.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, go nyakega eng go baeti gore ba tsene Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **A: Go namelela go phatša tempele ya Yasovarman**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Tempele ye ya godimo ga mmoto e agilwe go ya mafelelong a ngwagakgolo wa bo 9, nakong ya pušo ya Kgoši Yasovarman."" (The temples on top of the hill were built at the end of the 9th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.)  This indicates the temples themselves are the main attraction.
* While Angkor Pass is mentioned (C), it's a *requirement* to enter the temples, not the primary reason for visiting Phnom Krom.
* Option B is incorrect because while Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, the text focuses on the temple itself.
* Option D mentions a boat trip, which is an *alternative* way to get there, but not a requirement to enter the temple.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se ka thibelago baeti ba go etela Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: Tšhelete e ntši ya go etela moo (The high cost of visiting)**.

Here's why:

* The passage mentions that tourist trips are limited to a short window (Nov-Feb) and are often to specific areas.  It also notes that only a few researchers live there year-round. This implies that travel to Antarctica is not a casual or inexpensive undertaking.
* Option B is incorrect because the passage mentions visits to multiple areas, not just the Ross Sea.
* Option C is incorrect because the passage states that trips are *only* possible during Nov-Feb, not December and January.
* Option D is a possibility, but the cost is a much more significant and general barrier to entry for most people. While someone might have physical limitations, the financial aspect is a more common constraint.



"
Moeti yo a ratago go namela dithaba a ka etela karolo efe ya Antartica?,"The correct answer is **D: Dihlakahlaka (The Antarctic Peninsula)**.

Here's why:

The text states that tourists who want to see the scenery are often invited to the Antarctic Peninsula, the Dihlakahlaka, and the Ross Sea. It also mentions that scientists go to the mountains to climb them. Therefore, the Dihlakahlaka is a logical choice for someone interested in climbing mountains.

The other options are less directly linked:

*   **Lewatle la Ross (Ross Sea)** is mentioned as a place tourists are invited to, but not specifically for climbing mountains.
*   **Nagabogare (The continent itself)** is a general location.
*   **Peninsula** is also mentioned as a tourist destination but isn't specifically stated as a mountain climbing location.



"
Bonnyane ke kae mo dilo tša sebjalebjale di ka hwetšwago gona?,"The correct answer is **B: Toropong**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""gantši di hwetšagala ditoropong goba dikampeng..."" which translates to ""often they are found in towns or camps...""

Therefore, the answer is **B: Toropong (towns)**.
"
Ke kae mo telescope ya sebjalebjale ya dinyakišišo e ba bewago gona?,"The correct answer is **B: Khamphaseng ya yunibesithi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dipono tša lefaufau tša pele ga sebjalebjale gantši ke mafelo a kgale, gomme e dula e le dimuseamu, goba mafelo a thuto. Ka ge tšhilafalo ye bofefo mehleng ya tšona ya go tuma e be e se mohuta wa bothata bja lehono, gantši di hwetšagala ditoropong goba dikampeng...""

This indicates that telescopes for astronomical research are often found in university campuses (khamphaseng ya yunibesithi) as part of educational institutions. While they *can* be in museums or large educational facilities, university campuses are a common location for research-focused telescopes.



"
"Go ya karolo ye, ke lefelo lefe leo e ka bago la maleba bakeng sa letšatši la go homola lebopong la lewatle?","The correct answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions that Tamaki Drive, which is a significant part of the Waitemata Harbour, runs through Mission Bay and St Heliers. It also states that these are family-friendly areas with various shops along the waterfront.

While the other options are related to the harbour, they aren't as specifically mentioned as places to *experience* the waterfront for a morning outing.  The North Harbor District is more focused on shipping, and Waitemata Harbor is the general area, not a specific destination. St Heliers is also mentioned, but Mission Bay is included in the description of family-friendly areas along the Tamaki Drive waterfront.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke kae mo go rutha go ka bago go bolokegile?","The correct answer is **B: North Harbor District**.

The passage states: ""Mawatle a Lebopo la Lebowa (seleteng sa North Harbour) a Pacific Ocean gomme a tloga Long Bay lebowa la Devonport ka borwa. Ka moka e nyakile go ba mabopo a santa ka go rutha go go bolokegilego..."" 

This directly indicates that the North Harbour District is a place where ferries operate reliably.
"
"Ge o etetše lefelo leo le hlalositšwego karolong ye, ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se tla lebelelwago e se sa maleba?","The correct answer is **A: Go diragatša dikeno (Pay respects)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a place of immense significance and suffering (likely referring to the Holocaust or a similar site). It emphasizes the importance of reverence, respect, and honoring the victims. The question asks what is expected *after* arriving at this place.  Paying respects (diragatša dikeno) is the most appropriate action in such a context.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tlogela mongwalo kaekae lefelong leo (Leave a personal item there):** While leaving a small token of remembrance *might* be done, it's not the primary expectation mentioned or the most universally applicable. The passage focuses on a broader attitude of respect.
* **C: Go dira metlae (Act inappropriately):** This is the opposite of what's expected. The passage explicitly warns against inappropriate behavior.
* **D: Go kgobola moago o itšego goba selo (Destroy something or a thing):** This is the most disrespectful action imaginable and directly contradicts the passage's emphasis on reverence and preserving the memory.



"
Ke polelwana efe go tše yeo e hlalošago maleme a lingua franca?,"The correct answer is **A: Maitirelo (Convenience)**.

The passage states that lingua francas arise from ""dipolelo tša hlago goba tša nnete tšeo di tumilego bakeng sa lebaka le tee goba le lengwe bjalo ka mokgwa wa poledišano."" This translates to ""common or true beliefs that are popular for a certain reason or another as a means of communication.""  The *reason* they become popular is because they are *convenient* for people who need to communicate across language barriers.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ga se a tlhago (It's not a need):** While not strictly a *necessity* for everyone, convenience is the primary driver of a lingua franca's adoption.
* **C: A hlamilwe (It's enforced):** Lingua francas generally emerge organically, not through enforcement.
* **D: A humile (It disappeared):** The passage describes their *origin*, not their eventual disappearance.



"
Ke lefoko lefe leo le sa hlalošeng ka nepo maleme a tlaleletšo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ke maleme a tlhago le ao a hlamilwego**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the definition of ""maleme a tlaleletšo"" (interpretive mediators).** The text describes them as people who help bridge communication gaps between people who struggle to communicate.
* **Option B, ""Ke maleme a tlhago le ao a hlamilwego"" (They are mediators who are skilled and experienced), best captures this meaning.**  It highlights their ability to understand and navigate different perspectives and facilitate understanding.
* **Other options are less accurate:**
    * **A:** While mediators might help people resolve conflicts, the primary focus of the text is on communication *difficulty*, not conflict resolution.  The text also states that mediators do not necessarily speak the lingua franca.
    * **C:**  While mediators *do* help resolve communication problems, option B emphasizes the key characteristic of their skill and experience.
    * **D:**  Focusing on who speaks the language is less important than their *skill* as mediators. The text states they don't *have* to speak the lingua franca.



Therefore, **B** is the most fitting definition from the options provided."
"Go ya ka karolo ye, motho o swanetše go lebelela eng ge e ba sekepe se a tlo se namelago e le ka marega?","The correct answer is **A: Kabine**.

The passage states: ""ge go sepela ka gare ga aese go ka dira lešhata la go šiiša bakeng sa bao ba amegilego"" which translates to ""when it's cold inside, it can create a risk for those who are ill."" This refers to the cabin (kabine) of the ship.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dinyakwa tša visa (Visa requirements):** While mentioned, the question asks what to *expect* on the ship itself, not about visa requirements.
* **C: Melawana (Regulations):** Regulations are mentioned as something to be aware of, but the immediate concern related to the ship is the cabin.
* **D: Tekano ya nako ye e fetšwago toropong (Duration of the trip):** The passage mentions the duration of the trip to Saint Petersburg, but not what to expect *on the ship* as a passenger.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ge motho a tlo namela sekepe ka selemo, a ka kgona go phema eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go fetša nako a le toropong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maeto a dikepe a Saint Petersburg a akaretša nako ka toropong."" This directly translates to ""Ship trips to Saint Petersburg include time in the city.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go phatša gare ga aese** (To get a cabin): While cabins are part of the trip, the passage focuses on the time spent in the city.
* **C: Dinyakwa tša visa** (Visa requirements): The passage explicitly says that passengers do not *need* visas, so this is incorrect.
* **D: Saint Petersburg:** While Saint Petersburg is the destination, the passage highlights the *time spent* there as a key aspect of the trip.



"
Ke ka baka la eng gantši se-Catalan se šomišwa bakeng sa maswao le go dira ditsebišo go la Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: E be e le leleme la pele la semmušo motseng wo (It was the official language of the city)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Efela, maswao a mantši a laeditšwe fela go la Catalan ka lebaka la gore e hlomamišitšwe ke molao bjalo ka leleme la pele la semolao."" (However, many signs are only written in Catalan because it is mandated by law as the official language). This directly links the official status of Catalan to its prevalence in signage and announcements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Se kwešišwa ke batho ba bantši go feta Sepaniši (It is understood by more people than Spanish):** The passage states the opposite - most people understand Spanish, and they naturally start understanding it.
* **C: Ke leleme leo le ratwago kudu go la Barcelona (It is the language most loved in Barcelona):** While Catalan may be culturally significant, the passage doesn't say it's the most loved language. It highlights the *legal* mandate.
* **D: Diterene tša ka fase ga lefase le meago e mengwe di etelwa gantši ke badudi bao ba bolelago se-Catalan (Underground trains and other attractions are often visited by people who speak Catalan):**  The passage mentions Catalan being used for signs and announcements, not specifically linked to visitor numbers at attractions.



"
Ke leleme lefe go ao a latelago leo le šomišwago ke tshepedišo ya Diterene tša Barcelona tša ka Tlase ga Lefase go dira ditsebišo ka mehla?,"The correct answer is **C: Spanish**.

The text states: ""...ditšhitišo tša go se beakantšwe di tsebišwa ke tshepedišo yeo e beetšwego sa ruri ka maleme a go fapafapana go akaretša Spanish, English, French, Arabic le Japanese.""  This translates to ""...the announcements are made by a system called a rolling announcement that includes Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese."" Therefore, Spanish is one of the languages used for announcements.
"
"Go ya karolo ye, ke dilo dife go tše di latelago tšeo mafelo a maemo a go fana ka marobalo le dijo tša mesong a ka se di etišego pele?","The correct answer is **A: Lenaneo la dilo tša go ikgetha (Self-catering facilities)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Bed & Breakfasts (B&Bs) primarily compete on ""borobalelo le dijo tša mesong"" (accommodation and full board). It then goes on to say that self-catering facilities (like a kitchenette) are *expected* in these accommodations. The text also mentions ""dijo tša go ikgetha tša moamogedi"" (self-catering provisions), which directly supports the idea of self-catering facilities being a common offering.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Diphatlo tša sekgale (Historical artifacts):** While historical significance might *exist*, it's not a primary expectation or a core offering in B&Bs.
*   **C: Mekgotha ya go hlokomelwa gabotse (Good housekeeping):** Good housekeeping is *expected* in any accommodation, not just B&Bs with a focus on self-catering.
*   **D: Tirelo ya Inthanete ya go akgofa (Free Wi-Fi):** Free Wi-Fi is becoming increasingly common, but it isn't specifically linked to the core offering of self-catering facilities, as described in the text.

Therefore, the focus on self-catering facilities makes option A the most logical answer."
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo go sa phadišanwego kudu ka sona mafelong a maemo a go fana ka marobalo le dijo tša mesong?","The correct answer is **C: Mepete ya maemo a godimo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Bed & Breakfasts (B&Bs) primarily compete on two things: **accommodation and food**.  It then goes on to mention that traditionally, travelers needed to find places for religious lodging (like monasteries or convents). This is juxtaposed with the modern expectation of B&Bs providing both accommodation and food. 

Option C, ""Mepete ya maemo a godimo"" (Upper-class cuisine/food), directly relates to the ""food"" aspect of the competition. The passage implies that the food offered is a key factor for B&Bs to succeed, and catering to a higher-class clientele with refined cuisine is a competitive strategy.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Mekgabišo ya sebjalebjale** (Vegetable cultivation): While providing fresh vegetables is part of offering food, the passage doesn't specifically highlight vegetable cultivation as a major competitive factor.
*   **B: Mehutahuta ya dijo tša mesong go ya ka sehla** (Healthy food trends based on diet): The passage mentions healthy food options but doesn't emphasize adapting to specific diet trends as a primary competitive strategy.
*   **D: Dijo le dino tša go rekwa kgauswi** (Purchased food and dining): This is a possible source of food, but it doesn't focus on the type or quality of food in the same way that ""Mepete ya maemo a godimo"" does.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng go dilo tše di latelago seo se ka se dirwego Beijing ka 2022?","The correct answer is **D: Dipapadi tša aeseng tša ka gare ga meago**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Beijing e tla swara meletlo ya go bula le go tswalela le ditiragalo tša ka gare tša aese."" This translates to ""Beijing will host opening and closing ceremonies and indoor events.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Meletlo ya go bula dipapadi:** While the text mentions the opening ceremony, it's only one aspect of what Beijing will host.
* **B: Ditiragalo tša papadi ya go thelela lehlweng ya Taizicheng:** This refers specifically to the skiing events in Zhangjiakou, not general events in Beijing.
* **C: Meletlo ya go tswalela dipapadi:**  Similar to option A, this refers to a single element (closing ceremony), while the text mentions more.



Therefore, option D, which encompasses both opening and closing ceremonies *and* indoor events, is the most accurate reflection of what Beijing will host according to the text.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng go dilo tše di latelago seo se tlo go dirwa Beijing ka 2022?","The correct answer is **D: Meletlo ya go tswalela dipapadi**.

The text states: ""Beijing e tla swara meletlo ya go bula le go tswalela le ditiragalo tša ka gare tša aese."" which translates to ""Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor events.""

While the other options are also mentioned (Summer Olympics, indoor events, Winter Olympics), the *primary* focus of the paragraph is on the hosting of ceremonies and events, making ""Meletlo ya go tswalela dipapadi"" (Hosting of events) the best fit.
"
Ke bomang ba lego kotsing e kgolo ya go swarwa ke mpshikela wa avian?,"The correct answer is **B: Batho ba go šoma ka diphoofolo tša go ba le lerapo la mokokotlo (People who work with poultry)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bontši bo akareditše batho bao ba šomago ka dikgogo, efela go na le dikotsi tše dingwe gape go bahlokomedi ba dinonyana."" (Many people were included, but there are also other risks for poultry workers). This indicates that people who work directly with poultry are at higher risk.

While people who have been exposed (A) are at risk, the primary concern is for those in close contact with the birds. Option C (people who work with poultry) is a more specific and accurate answer than just ""people who work with poultry."" Option D (people who have already been infected) isn't a risk group, but rather someone who has already experienced the illness.



"
"Go ya karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago le hlalošago ka nepo mokhuhlwane wa dinonyana?","The correct answer is **C: Batho ba go bogela dinonyana ba kotsing ya go swarwa ke bolwetši bjo.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that avian influenza can spread to humans, and while some cases are mild, others are dangerous.
* It then mentions that ""Bontši bo akareditše batho bao ba šomago ka dikgogo..."" (Many believe that people who work with poultry...).
* The sentence following that is ""efela tše dingwe tša tšona di bile kotsi kudu."" (but others of them were very dangerous).

This implies that people who are exposed to poultry are at risk of contracting the disease. Option C directly reflects this risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ke feela bao ba šomago ka dikgogo ba fetetšwego ke mokhuhlwane** (Only those who work with poultry are infected by the virus) - The passage explicitly states that *others* besides poultry workers can be at risk.
* **B: Go begilwe gore batho ba bantši ba tsenwe ke bolwetši bjo go feta dinonyana** (It was believed that many people were infected with this disease more than poultry) - The passage doesn't state that many people were infected *more than* poultry; it just says it can spread.
* **D: Batho ka moka bao ba tsenwego ke bolwetši bjo ba hlokofetše** (People who are infected with this disease have suffered) - The passage doesn't mention suffering; it discusses risk and the severity of some cases.



"
Canal ya White Sea-Baltic e kgokagana le eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Lake Onega le River Volga**.

The text states: ""White Sea–Baltic Canal e kgokagantša Arctic Ocean go ya Baltic Sea, ka Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga le Saint Petersburg, kudu ka dinoka le matsha. Letsha la Onega le kgomagane gape le Volga..."" which translates to ""White Sea–Baltic Canal connects Arctic Ocean to Baltic Sea, via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mainly by canals and rivers. Lake Onega and the Volga also flow...""

Therefore, the canal connects Lake Onega and the Volga River.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mohuteng ofe wa senamelwa seo go sona dipaseporoto di ka tšewago gore banamedi ba se šitišwe?","The correct answer is **B: Ditimeleng tša bošego tša go ba le marobalo (Immigration health checks)**.

The text states: ""On trains for long-distance travel, passports can be retained by the authorities to ensure they are fit to travel."" This implies that passports are checked during immigration health checks.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke neng moo pukwana ya gago ya boitsebišo e ka hlahlobjago ditimeleng tša go tshela mellwane?","The correct answer is **A: Ka morago ga go fologa setimela** (After you get off the train).

Here's why: The text states that at the beginning of a journey (when you board a train, boat, or other transport), you are typically not searched.  The searches happen *after* you arrive at your destination, particularly on overnight trains, where your passport might be checked. Therefore, the most logical place for a personal identification check related to travel is *after* you disembark.
"
Ke bothata bofe bjo go nago le kgonagalo e kgolo ya gore bo direge ge o dula dinageng tša molatšatši tša go swana le Singapore?,"The correct answer is **A: Go swarwa poo (Humidity)**.

The text explicitly mentions that Singapore is located in the ""tropics"" and experiences **daily rainfall** and **heat (especially when it's humid)**.  Humidity is a key component of this heat.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go hloka mabenkele (Lack of shops):** The text states you can buy anything after arrival, implying shops are readily available.
* **C: Go tlaišwa ke molapo wa go bakwa ke phišo (Being affected by a royal family's curse):** This is a nonsensical option and not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Go timela (Being stranded):** The text doesn't mention being stranded.
"
Ke mang yo a ka nyakago go phema go ja dikuku tša Sejeremane?,"The correct answer is **B: Motho wa go rata ditisete tša swikiri e ntši** (Someone who likes a lot of sweets).

Here's why:

* The text emphasizes that German pastries are sweet, often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and are frequently enjoyed with strong coffee. 
* It specifically mentions ""dikhekhe tšeo di tlwaelegilego"" (common cakes) and ""Berliner, Pfannkuchen goba Krapfen"" (which are essentially filled doughnuts – very sweet!). 

Therefore, someone who enjoys sweet treats would be most likely to enjoy German pastries. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Motho wa ba go ba le aletši ya dimake** (Someone who is allergic to nuts) - While many pastries contain nuts, this isn't a defining characteristic of someone who enjoys them.
* **C: Motho wa go se rate tšhokolete** (Someone who doesn't like chocolate) - While some German pastries *might* have chocolate, the text doesn't focus on chocolate as a primary ingredient.
* **D: Motho wa go rata dilo tša swikiri go feta tša go baba** (Someone who likes sweets more than savory foods) - This is very close, but the text doesn't explicitly state that German pastries are *only* sweet. They often have nutty elements as well. However, it's a much better fit than the other options.



"
Ke metswako efe yeo e tšewago e le metswako ya sehla ya dikuku tša Sejeremane?,"The correct answer is **A: Diapola (Plums)**.

The text states: ""Diapola di apeiwa ka gare ga dikuku ngwaga ka moka..."" which translates to ""Plums are baked inside the cakes annually..."" This indicates that plums are a traditional and common filling for German cakes.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo motho wa go tšea maeto ka tšhelete ya go itekanela a ka se kgothaletšwego go se dira?","The correct answer is **D: Go fokotša ditshenyegelo tša dijo le marobalo (Reduce spending on food and entertainment)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the importance of financial planning and avoiding debt when traveling on a budget. Option D directly aligns with this advice. Reducing spending on non-essential items like food and entertainment is a common and effective way to save money for travel.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go nyaka mešongwana yeo o ka e dirago maetong (Buying travel insurance):** While travel insurance is wise, it's a *necessary* expense, not something to be *avoided* to save money. The text focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs.
* **B: Go fetofetoga le maemo ka boiketlo bja gago (Changing your mindset):**  While a positive mindset is helpful for budgeting, it's not a specific action to take to save money.  The text focuses on tangible actions.
* **C: Go kgopela batho tšhelete (Borrowing money from people):** The text explicitly warns against borrowing money and falling into debt.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mang yo a ka se ipshinego ka leeto ka baka la go ba le tšhelete ye nnyane?","The correct answer is **A: Motho wa go rata go phadišano (Someone who likes to bargain)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes finding ways to travel cheaply.  The key phrase is ""Go bona lefase ka theko ya fase"" (To see the world at a low cost).  Bargaining is a primary way to reduce travel expenses (flights, accommodation, activities). The passage also mentions careful planning and prioritizing, which aligns with a resourceful and perhaps bargaining-oriented person.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Motho wa go hloka nako (Someone who needs time):**  While planning is important, the passage focuses on *cost*, not *time*.
*   **C: Motho wa go šoma ka inthanete a le maetong (Someone who works online and travels):** The passage is about *traveling* with limited funds, not working while traveling.
*   **D: Motho wa go rata go kgomarela ditaelo tša maeto (Someone who likes to follow travel instructions):**  While following instructions is important for a safe trip, the core message is about *finding ways to save money*, not simply adhering to a pre-planned itinerary.



"
"Go mafoko ao a latelago, ke lefe leo le sa hlalošeng ka nepo go otlela magareng ga Point Marion le Fairmont?","The correct answer is **C: Baotledi ga ba latele melao ya tsela** (People don't follow traffic laws).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hlokomela: metheteog, ditsejana tše disese, le mejika ya go rakelela ke tše dintši. Dipeelo tša lebelo tšeo di patladitšwego di bonagana di le fase go feta dikarolong tša go latelana tšeo di fetilwego — tša go tlwaelega 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - gomme di thibela kobamelo go tšona ka go bohlokwa kudu go feta ka tsela yengwe."" (Beware: there are many curves, sharp turns, and guardrails. Recorded speeds are lower than the posted speeds - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and accidents are avoided primarily by not going faster than other roads.)

This implies that drivers *are* generally following traffic laws (posted speed limits, etc.) and accidents are avoided *by not speeding*. The passage *doesn't* say people are disregarding traffic laws.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Go na le ditsela tša molala tša lekatana** (There are parallel dirt roads): While the passage describes curves, it doesn't mention parallel dirt roads. This is a possibility, but the passage doesn't highlight it as a primary cause of danger.
* **B: Ditsela di pitlagane** (The roads are narrow): The passage mentions curves and sharp turns, which can *create* a feeling of narrow roads, but it doesn't explicitly state the roads are physically narrow.
* **D: Tirelo ya mogala ga se bothata** (Animal traffic is not a problem): The passage mentions guardrails and suggests accidents are avoided primarily by not speeding, not by avoiding animals.

Therefore, the statement that people aren't following traffic laws is the least supported and therefore the best answer.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo e swanetšego go ba tlhobaboroko go baotledi ba mmileng wa lephefo wa Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **B: Go hloka tirelo ya mogala e lekanego (Lack of adequate following distance).**

Here's why: The passage explicitly states: ""Dipeelo tša lebelo tšeo di patladitšwego di bonagana di le fase go feta dikarolong tša go latelana tšeo di fetilwego – tša go tlwaelega 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) ** gomme di thibela kobamelo go tšona ka go bohlokwa kudu go feta ka tsela yengwe.**"" This means drivers need to maintain a *larger* following distance than they might on other highways.  Lack of a proper following distance would make it impossible to react safely to sudden stops, which are common on this route.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Go senyegelwa ke koloi ka gare ga sephetephete (Being overtaken by another car on the shoulder):** While possible, the passage doesn't highlight this as a primary concern.
* **C: Go phamogela ka thoko ka lebelo le legolo (Starting off with a large speed):**  The passage emphasizes *slower* speeds and being prepared to stop.  Starting fast would be dangerous, but the lack of following distance is the main issue.
* **D: Go hlakana kgafetšakgafetša le balokiši ba mmila (Speeding and ignoring traffic signals):**  While speeding is dangerous, the passage focuses on the reduced following distance *regardless* of speed. The text doesn't emphasize speeding as the biggest problem; reacting to sudden stops is.



Therefore, the most important thing for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburg route is to maintain a larger than usual following distance to allow for safe stopping.



"
Ke selo sefe go tšeo di latelago seo se sa nyakegego ge o thoma go sesa ka seketswana?,"The correct answer is **D: Go tlwaetšwa gannyane (Being accustomed to/getting used to)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the process of ""go tshela meedi"" (living in water) which includes swimming, breathing, and diving. The passage explicitly states that you need to be able to **swim (rutha), hold your breath (namela), and dive (fofa)**.  

""Go tlwaetšwa gannyane"" (being accustomed to something) isn't directly related to the physical skills required for swimming. While being comfortable in the water is helpful, it's not a core requirement for the actual process of ""go tshela meedi"" as described.  The passage focuses on the *actions* needed to stay in the water.

Let's look at why the other options are relevant:

* **A: Go kgona go rutha (Being able to swim):** This is directly mentioned as a necessary skill.
* **B: Seemo sa go se itekanele mmeleng (Body's self-regulation):**  This is related to controlling your breathing and other bodily functions in the water, essential for survival.
* **C: Go kgona go fofa (Being able to dive):**  This is also explicitly mentioned as a necessary skill.



Therefore, the only option not directly described or required in the passage is being accustomed to the water.



"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se ka nyakegago gore go sesa gago ka seketswana go atlege?,"The correct answer is **B: Go ba le maitemogelo a go thinya ka meetseng (Having swimming skills)**.

Here's why:

* **The question describes a situation where someone has fallen into water and needs to be rescued.**  The most crucial skill for a rescuer in this scenario is the ability to swim effectively.  They need to be able to navigate the water to reach the person in distress.

Let's look at why the other options are less relevant:

* **A: Go kgona go raloka dipapadi (Being able to tie knots):** While knots can be helpful in rescue situations (for securing ropes, etc.), they are not the primary skill needed to *reach* the person.
* **C: Setifikheiti sa go sesa ka seketswana (A lifeguard certificate):** A lifeguard certificate indicates a certain level of training, but the basic ability to swim is fundamental for *anyone* involved in a water rescue, not just a certified lifeguard.
* **D: Go kgona go rutha (Being able to control oneself):** While self-control is important, it doesn't directly address the physical need to swim and reach the person.



Therefore, having swimming skills (maitemogelo a go thinya ka meetseng) is the most directly applicable and essential skill mentioned in the context of rescuing someone who has fallen into the water.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se tla thušago motho yo a nyakago go kampa ka gare ga koloi?","The correct answer is **A: Go kwešiša gabotse gore koloi ya gago e na le dilo dife feela.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Go šomiša sefatanaga sa gago ke tsela ye botse ya go tšea leeto efela ga se gantši ka bo yona e le tsela ya go """"""kampa"""""""".  It then explains that ""kampa ka safatanaga ke kgonega ge e le gore o na le bene ye kgolo, SUV, Sedan goba Station Wagon sa go ba le ditulo tša go patlama.""

This means having a larger vehicle with seating capacity is necessary to ""camp"" in your car.  Understanding what your car *has* in terms of space and seating is a fundamental first step.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Koloi ya gore disiti tša yona di kgona go robala:** While reclining seats are comfortable, they aren't essential for camping.
* **C: Tente:** A tent is *helpful* for camping, but the text focuses on the car's capacity first.
* **D: Lefelo la motho ka noši la go kampa:**  This refers to the person's physical condition, not the car's capabilities.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, batho ba go kampa ka dikoloing ba swanetše go phema eng gore ba be ka tlase ga eriale e kgolokgolo?","The correct answer is **A: Go otlela koloi e kgolo, bjalo ka di SUV goba dibene tše dikgolo**.

The passage states: ""Go kampa ka safatanaga ke kgonega ge e le gore o na le bene ye kgolo, SUV, Sedan goba Station Wagon sa go ba le ditulo tša go patlama."" This translates to: ""Camping in a tent is possible if you have a large vehicle, such as an SUV, Sedan, or Station Wagon with seating.""  Therefore, having a large vehicle is a requirement to camp in a tent.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke bomang bao ba agilego Casablanca ka lekga la bobedi?","The correct answer is **B: Bagwebi ba Sepania**.

The passage states: ""Mmuši wa Morocco o agile leswa moste bjalo ka Daru I-Badya gomme wa fiwa leina Casablanca ke bagwebi ba ma-Spanish bao ba thomilego go gwebišana moo."" This translates to: ""The Moroccan dynasty built the city like this, and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who started trading there.""
"
Ke bomang ba tlogetšego motse wa sebjalebjale wa Casablanca ka morago ga kotsi ya tlhago?,"The correct answer is **C: Masepaniši (Spanish)**.

The passage states: ""Mapotokisi a e sentše gomme ba e aga leswa ka fase ga leina la Casa Branca, go tla go e tlogela ka morago ga thothomelo ya lefase ka 1755."" This means the Portuguese built a settlement there, but it was *later* abandoned after the earthquake of 1755. Then, the Spanish traders started trading there and eventually named it Casablanca.

Therefore, the Spanish are the ones who ultimately ""tlogetšego"" (abandoned/left) the settlement after the earthquake.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, go tlile bjang gore toropo ya Sintra e tume go batšwantle?","The correct answer is **C: Dipolelo tše dibotse tša Lord Byron**.

The passage explicitly states that Sintra became popular for tourism ""after it was praised by the beautiful poems of Lord Byron."" Options A, B, and D are incorrect because the passage links Sintra's popularity directly to Byron's poems, not Cabo da Roca, Marian apparitions, or its military history.
"
Ke eng seo Armenia e sa se amogelego?,"The correct answer is **A: Selete sa Nagorno-Karabakh**.

The text states that the conflict began over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, and that Armenia supported the creation of a republic there. However, Azerbaijan did not accept this situation. Therefore, the core issue Armenia *didn't accept* was the situation *in* Nagorno-Karabakh itself.
"
Ke eng sa go tšwela pele se ama ditswalano tša Azerbaijan le Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Selete sa Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka 1994, selete sa Nagorno-Karabakh sa morafe wa maAmeniya Nagorno-Karabakh sa go tšwela ntwa gahlanong le maAzeri."" (In 1994, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between the Armenian family of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Azeris escalated.)

The entire passage revolves around the Nagorno-Karabakh issue as the root cause of the conflict.  The other options are related consequences or factors, but not the primary initiating cause.
"
"Ge o namela thekisi kua Charlotte, ke’ng se se tla dirago gore o lefe tšhelete e oketšegilego?","The correct answer is **A: Go dula tikologong e nngwe** (To live in a single-family home).

Here's why:

The passage states that many families choose Charlotte because of the abundance of single-family homes and the ease of raising children there. It also mentions that single-family homes in Uptown Charlotte have become increasingly scarce and expensive. Therefore, to have a financially sound housing choice in Charlotte, opting for a single-family home would be a logical approach, aligning with the passage's information.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Go ba le banamedi ba bararo** (To have two children): While having children is common in Charlotte, the passage isn't directly linking the *number* of children to financial soundness of a housing choice.
*   **C: Go ya toropong** (To go to the city): The passage notes that single-family homes are becoming scarce *in* Uptown Charlotte, implying that going to the city might make finding affordable single-family homes harder.
*   **D: Go rata ba geno** (To like the people): While community is important, the passage doesn't directly link liking the people to financial soundness of housing.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se ka lebelelwago e le go hloka mahlatse go dula kua Charlotte le bana?","The correct answer is **A: Ditheko tša dintlo** (Housing costs).

Here's why:

The passage states that a major reason people move to Charlotte with children is its family-friendly environment and ease of raising a family.  However, it also mentions that over the last 20 years, there's been a surge in luxury apartment developments in Uptown Charlotte.  The passage implies that these luxury developments are potentially more expensive, suggesting that **housing costs** could be a significant obstacle to living in Charlotte with children.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Go namela thekisi (Finding a job):** While finding a job is important, the passage emphasizes the family-friendly aspects, not job availability as a barrier.
* **C: Badudi ba mafelong a mangwe (People from other states):**  The passage mentions people moving *to* Charlotte, not that people from other states are *unable* to live there.
* **D: Go leka go ipshina ka toropo (Being able to settle into the city):** The passage explicitly states Charlotte is easy to settle into with children, making this an unlikely challenge.



"
"Pele Masepaniši a fihla, ke mang yo a bego a laola karolo ya ka leboa ya Chile?","The correct answer is **C: Ke MaAraukhana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pele ga ge ma Spanish a fihla ka ngwagakgolo wa bo 16, leboa la Chile le be le le ka fase ga molao wa Inca mola ma Araucanian (Mapuche) a be a dula bogare bja le borwa bja Chile.""  This translates to: ""Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the north of Chile was under the law of the Inca, and the Mapuche (Araucanian) lived in the south of Chile.""

Therefore, the Mapuche (also known as Araucanian) were the people in control of the northern part of Chile before the Spanish arrival.
"
"Go ya karolo ye, ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se sa diragalago ka 1810?","The correct answer is **A: Go be go se na mmušo wa naga ka moka** (There was no national government).

Here's why:

* The text states that Chile declared independence in 1810 but that the *process* of independence didn't fully materialize until 1818.
* It also mentions the Napoleonic Wars disrupted Spain's control.
* Therefore, it's logical to infer that in 1810, there wasn't a fully established, functioning national government in Chile.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Chile e fentše Spain** (Chile gained independence from Spain) - The text says independence wasn't fully achieved until 1818.
* **C: Go be go lwewa dintwa tša Napoleon** (There were wars against Napoleon) - While the Napoleonic Wars were a factor, the text specifically mentions they disrupted Spain's control *without* necessarily implying a direct conflict *in* Chile in 1810.
* **D: Chile e ile ya thoma go ikemela** (Chile began to gain independence) - While Chile declared independence, the text emphasizes the process was incomplete in 1810.



"
Batho ba ka fihla bjang metsemagaeng a lekatana a seleteng sa Linguria?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka koloi goba setimela**

The text states: ""Ditsela, diterene le dikepe di kopanya dinagamagae..."" which translates to ""Roads, trains, and boats connect the villages..."".  Therefore, you can reach the villages by car or train.
"
Polelwana ya Italy ya gore “Cinque Terre’ e ra gore’ng?,"The correct answer is **A: Dinaga tše hlano** (Five Villages).

The passage states: ""Cinque Terre, yeo e na le dinaga tše Hlano..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which has Five Villages...""
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke diputso tša mohuta mang tšeo di ka swanelago maemo a go redimoša a marega?","The correct answer is **C: Diputso tša direthe tše ditelele (Long-lasting mats)**.

The text states: ""Diputsu tše dingwe di na le dikopopi...direthe goba direthe le solo."" This translates to ""Other mats have coatings...either mats or mats with coatings.""  The text also mentions the need for mats to be able to withstand temperature changes.  ""Diputsu tša direthe tše ditelele"" (long-lasting mats) would be the most suitable type to meet both of these criteria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Diputso tša direthe tša ntlhana (Short-lasting mats):** The text emphasizes the need for mats that can withstand temperature changes, implying durability is important.
* **B: Diputso tša go kgabišwa ka dikutukutu (Mats coated with rubber):** While rubber coatings might offer some protection, the text doesn't specifically mention rubber.
* **D: Diputsu tša go se be diintšhi tše 1/5 go iša (Mats that are less than 1/5 of an inch thick):** The text mentions the need for mats to be able to withstand temperature changes, implying thickness is important.
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše seo se ka se thušego go gogwa ga selo se itšego ditseleng tša aese nakong ya marega?,"The correct answer is **C: Santa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Santa, lekgwara goba letswai (calcium chloride) gantši di patlalatšwa ditseleng goba ditsejana go kaonafatša tsepetšo."" This translates to ""Salt, gravel or calcium chloride are often spread on roads or walkways to improve traction.""

Therefore, Santa (salt) is listed as a substance used to improve traction on icy roads. The other options are not mentioned in the text as solutions for icy road conditions.
"
Ke selo sefe go tšeo di latelago seo Dihlakahlaka tša Hawaii le Dihlakahlaka tša Cook di swanago ka sona?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka moka di šomiša nako ya go swana**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Cook Islands were thought of as ""Hawaii under the sea"" *before* the monarchy. This implies a historical connection and similarity in their development and perhaps way of life.
* The question asks what they *both* share. The passage doesn't mention either having many large hotels or not having a monarchy or towns. However, the ""Hawaii under the sea"" comparison strongly suggests a similar historical timeline and potentially similar cultural or societal development.  Therefore, they ""shared"" a similar time period in their history and development.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Ka moka di na le dihotele tše dintši tše dikgolo** - The passage specifically says the Cook Islands *lack* large hotels.
* **B: Ka moka ga di na mmušo** - The passage mentions they had a monarchy.
* **D: Ka moka ga di na ditoropo** - The passage doesn't mention anything about towns.
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se sa hlalosego ka nepo Dihlakahlaka tša Cook?,"The correct answer is **A: Ke tše dinyenyane go tša Hawaii**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Le ge e le ye nnyane, e gopotša baeti ba bangwe ba batšofe ka Hawaii pele ga pušo ntle le dihotele tše di kgolo tša baeti le ditšwelopele tše dingwe."" This directly means the Cook Islands are smaller than Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ke sehlopha sa dihlakahlaka:** The text clearly states, ""Ke sehlopa sa dihlakahlaka tše 15 tšeo di phatlaletšego godimo ga di km2 tše dimiliyone tše 2.2 tša lewatle.""
* **C: Ditoropo tše dikgolo ke Rarotonga le Aitutaki:** The text says, ""Tše kgolo ke Rarotonga le Aitutaki.""
* **D: Naga ya sehlakahlaka e šomiša nako ya go swana le ya Hawaii:** The text states, ""Le ge e le ye nnyane, e gopotša baeti ba bangwe ba batšofe ka Hawaii pele ga pušo ntle le dihotele tše di kgolo tša baeti le ditšwelopele tše dingwe."" This indicates a historical connection, not that they share the same timeframe.



"
Ke setiše sefe sa meraka seo se abelanago ka dikgetho tše pedi tša mehuta ya marobalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The passage states: ""Sirena ke sona setiši fela sa meraka seo e abelanelago ka marobalo a ka gare le dijo tša go fiša godimo ga go kampa."" (Sirena is the only species of monkey that shares interior habitat and food above the campsite.)

"Go ya ka karolo ye, o ka hwetša kae tumelelo ya go emiša sefatanaga ge e ba o nyaka go šomiša tšhelete go e na le go šomiša karata ya go kolotiša?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go a kgonega go hwetša ditumelelo tša go emiša difatanaga Setišing sa Ranger go la Puerto Jiménez, efela ga ba amogele dikarata tša sekoloto.""  This directly translates to: ""It is possible to obtain permits to camp in the Ranger Station at Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept camping cards.""
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mohuta ofe wa go fofa lehlweng wo o direlwago ga go theogela kudu?","The correct answer is **A: Go fofa lehlweng ga go namelela dithaba**.

The passage explicitly states: ""E tswalana le efela ga se gantši mo e lokelago mokgwa wa boeti bja go fofa lehlweng wa alpine goba go namela ditaba go na le lehlwa, tše di boletšwego morago di dirwa mafelong a go theogela...""  This translates to ""It is similar to the mostly common way of alpine climbing or ascending peaks, where there is a slope, and the subsequent passages are done on slopes that are steep and require climbing with crampons.""

Therefore, the passage directly links climbing slopes on mountains with the type of climbing used for ascending.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se ka thušago batho ba go fofa lehlweng kua nageng bao ba ratago lebelo?","The correct answer is **B: Mokotla wa go athwa wa go imela (Self-arrest device)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that in the event of an avalanche, self-arrest is crucial.  It also mentions that steep slopes and snow bridges make self-arrest difficult.
* A self-arrest device is specifically designed to stop a skier or snowboarder who has initiated a slide. It's the primary tool for preventing further travel and injury.
* The other options are less directly relevant:
    * **A: Diputsu tša go kgwahla kudu (Highly specialized boots):** While important for skiing, boots don't directly address the issue of stopping an avalanche.
    * **C: Maemo a mabotse (Good weather conditions):**  Good weather minimizes avalanche risk but doesn't provide a solution *if* an avalanche occurs.
    * **D: Ditsejana tša go kgorwa botse (Good avalanche forecasts):**  Good forecasts help avoid avalanche terrain, but they don't help *if* you're caught in an avalanche.



Therefore, the self-arrest device is the most helpful tool for those who want to ski in avalanche terrain and have a safe experience.
"
Batho ba go tsena-leswa ba ba le bothata bja go dirang?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tlwaela setšo sa lefelo le leswa (Getting used to the local culture and customs)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ge o boela gae ka morago ga go dula mošamawatle, o tlwaetše setšo se seswa gomme o lahlile mekgwa ya gago ya go tšwa setšong sa geno."" (When you return home after staying at the resort, you are used to the local culture and lose the customs of your own.) and ""Baeti bao ba bilego le nako ye bonolo ya go tlwaela setšo se seswa ka nako tše dingwe ba ba le nako ye thata ya go boela morago setšong sa bona."" (Guests who had an easy time getting used to the local culture at other times had a difficult time returning to their own culture.)

The other options are not directly addressed in the passage.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, go tsena-leswa nageng go ka ba thata ka go kgethega go baeti ba mohuta mang?","The correct answer is **A: Go baeti bao ba itemogetšego bothata bja go tlwaela setšo.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Baeti bao ba bilego le nako ye bonolo ya go tlwaela setšo se seswa ka nako tše dingwe ba ba le nako ye thata ya go boela morago setšong sa bona."" (Guests who had an easy time acclimatizing to the hot weather at other times had a difficult time returning to the resort.)

This directly points to guests who *struggle* to acclimatize as being the ones who find the return difficult.
"
Ke selo sefe go dilo tšeo di latelago seo batho ba swanetšego go phema go se dira le diphoofolo tše di bitšwago di-moose?,"The correct answer is **C: Go nyenyefatša go ba kotsi ga tšona (Avoid making them feel threatened).**

Here's why:

* The passage states that moose only attack when they feel threatened. 
* Option C directly addresses this by saying to avoid actions that might make the moose feel threatened.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go di hlokomologa (Take care of them):** While generally good to respect wildlife, the passage focuses on preventing attacks, not directly caring for them.
* **B: Go di batamela ka go nanya (Approach them cautiously):**  Cautious approach *might* be necessary, but the core idea is to avoid making them *feel* threatened.
* **D: Go di bogela o le kgole (Feed them):** Feeding wildlife is generally discouraged as it can change their behavior and make them dependent on humans. It also can be dangerous for both the animals and people.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago le sa bolelego nnete ka di-moose?","The correct answer is **A: Di bogale ka tlhago (They are dangerous by nature)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that moose aren't naturally aggressive, only defensive. 
* Option A directly contradicts this statement by saying they *are* dangerous by nature. 
* The other options align with the passage's information:
    * B:  They *can* be dangerous under certain circumstances.
    * C:  They *might* attack if provoked.
    * D:  They *may* act defensively when threatened.



Therefore, option A is the statement that is *not* supported by the passage."
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se ka se bego kotsi kudu go moeti wa maganateng?","The correct answer is **D: Go senya meetse a kitimiša seo nkego ke meetse.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Le maganata a go fiša kudu a ka tonya kudu bošego."" This translates to: ""And getting very cold can greatly damage the body.""  The passage also mentions that extremely low body temperatures are a serious danger without warm clothing.  Therefore, *getting cold* (senya meetse) is directly linked to a serious risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go hloka diaparo tša borutho bošego bja go tonya** (Lack of warm clothing to stay warm): While lack of warm clothing is a risk, the passage directly states that *getting cold* is the danger.
*   **B: Go bona seo nkego ke meetse** (Seeing what appears to be water): This is mentioned as something that could happen, but it's not inherently dangerous *in itself*. The danger comes from the consequences of that situation.
*   **C: Go iphetša maatla a kitimiša selo seo ekego ke meetse** (Trying to maintain strength when something appears to be water):  This is not a specific risk mentioned in the passage. The passage doesn't discuss trying to maintain strength in that situation.



"
Ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se sa bolelwego se ka ba kotsi go basepedi ba maganateng?,"The correct answer is **B: Go bona dilo tšeo nkego ke meetse (Go bona dilo tšeo nkego ke meetse)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka gare ga phišo ya letšatši, baeti ba ka itemogela bono yeo e ba dirago gore ba bone tše nkego ba bona meetse (goba dilo tše dingwe).""  This translates to: ""After a sunstroke, visitors may experience hallucinations of seeing water (or other things).""  It then goes on to explain that this can be dangerous if the person doesn't seek help, as it can lead to further complications.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Go hloka meetse (Dehydration):** While dehydration is a serious concern with heatstroke, the passage doesn't directly link it to hallucinations.
*   **C: Go fokotšega ga phišo ya mmele (Body temperature drop):**  The passage mentions *very high* body temperatures as a risk, not a drop in temperature.
*   **D: Go fišwa ke letšatši (Sunstroke):** Sunstroke itself is the underlying cause of the hallucinations, but the question asks about the *hallucinations* as a specific danger.

Therefore, the hallucinations are directly stated as a dangerous symptom of sunstroke in the passage.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sehlopha sefe sa batho seo se amilego kudu ke go fihla ga basepedi ba go ithuta dinaga tše diswa?","The correct answer is **C: Mataino**.

The text states: ""Sehlakahlaka se dutšwe pele ke ma-Taínos le Caribes. Ma-Caribes e be e le ba go bolela se-Arawakan bao ba fihlilego ka bo 10,000 BCE. Ka korago ga mengwaga ye mmalwa ye mekopana ya go fihla ga basepedi ba ma-Europe, batho ba Tainos ba be ba fokotšegile kudu ke bafenyi ba ma-Spanish.""

This indicates that the Taínos were the primary inhabitants when the Europeans arrived and were significantly impacted by them. While the Caribes were present earlier, the Taínos were the main group encountered by the Spanish.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, Ma-Caribes a be a bolela leleme lefe?","The correct answer is **D: Se-Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""Ma-Caribes e be e le ba go bolela se-Arawakan bao ba fihlilego ka bo 10,000 BCE."" which translates to ""The Caribs were a speaking Arawakan who arrived 10,000 BCE.""
"
Ke bomang bao ba pele ba go bula papadi ya go thelela lehlweng?,"The correct answer is **B: Batho ba Norway**.

The text states: ""ka 1861 sehlopha segolo sa pele sa go thelela se butšwe ke Norwegians ka Australia."" This directly indicates that Norwegians were the first group to start skiing as a recreational activity.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke neng moo go thelela lehlweng go ilego gwa lebelelwa e le papadi?","The correct answer is **A: Ngwagakgolong wa bo-17**.

The text states: ""Go thelela moo go theogelago bjalo ka papadi go ya go le ge ekaba ngwagakgolo wa bo 17..."" which translates to ""Going skiing as a sport didn't become popular until the 17th century...""
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo ka tlwaelo se tswalanywago le sehlakahlaka se segologolo sa lebopong la bohlabela bja Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: Tšhušumetšo ya Yuropa (European influence)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tšhušumetšo ya Yuropa le bothopi di thomile ka ngwagakgolo wa bo 15..."" (European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century...). This is presented as a significant turning point in the history of Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate as the *most* significant overarching influence:

* **B: Bodumedi bja Islam (Spread of Islam):** While Islam had a significant impact, the passage frames the European influence as a more recent and arguably more transformative force in shaping the overall political and social landscape of Africa.
* **C: Bophelo bja lešoka (Wildlife):**  While Africa is known for its wildlife, this is a characteristic of the continent rather than a historical influence that shaped its political or social development.
* **D: Diresote tša maemo (Coastal settlements):** Coastal settlements were important, but the passage connects their rise directly to the *European* interest in trade and exploration. Coastal settlements themselves weren't the overarching influence.



Therefore, the arrival and influence of European powers is presented as the most pivotal event shaping the subsequent history of Africa in the passage."
Ke eng seo dihlakahlaka tše dinyenyane tša East Africa di se nago sona? ,"The correct answer is **A: Go amana le France**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bontši bja dihlakehlake tše dinnyane ke dinaga tšeo di ikemego, goba tša go amana le France..."" which translates to ""Many of the smaller states were either independent or allied with France...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Diresote tša maemo tše dintši (Many coastal forts):** While coastal forts existed, the text emphasizes that these states weren't as dependent on coastal forts as other regions.
* **C: Go tuma ka bophelo bja lešoka (Being known for its wildlife):**  Madagascar is mentioned as being famous for its wildlife, not the smaller East African states in general.
* **D: Go ikemela ntle le thušo ya dinaga tše dingwe (Being independent without the help of other countries):** While some states were independent, the text indicates that others were allied with France, so this isn't a universal characteristic.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ba bangwe ba keteka bjang go tsoga ga Kriste, kudukudu dikereke tša setšo?","The correct answer is **B: Go swara moletelo ka Mokibelo bošego.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dithutišo tša se-Kreste tšeo di hlalosago setlogo se, efile e ka tloga e le tirelo ya pele ga Christian Spring le Fertility. **Dithutišo tša se-Kreste tšeo di hlalosago setlogo se, efile e ka tloga e le tirelo ya pele ga Christian Spring le Fertility.

"Go phema dinyakwa tše itšego ge o tsena Ecuador, ke’ng seo modudi wa Cuba a swanetše go ba le sona pele?","The correct answer is **B: Lengwalo la memo la molaong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ecuador e nyaka badudi ba Cuba ba amogele lengwalo la memo pele ba tsena Ecuador ka boemafofane bja boditšhabatšhaba goba dintlha tša kamogelo ya ka pele."" This directly translates to ""Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to submit a letter of memo before entering Ecuador on a visa-free basis or for initial reception information.""

While the other options are requirements, the memo is the *first* thing they need to submit.
"
Dinyakwa tša maeto tša Ecuador ga se tša direlwa eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go boloka palo ya basepedi e le tlasana** (To keep the number of tourists low).

Here's why:

The text states that the memo was issued to address the influx of Cuban citizens entering Ecuador.  This implies a concern about controlling the number of tourists entering the country. While the other options are elements of the regulations, the overarching reason for issuing the memo (and thus the travel requirements) is to manage the tourist population.
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se ka turago kudu nageng ya ka ntle go feta nageng ya geno?,"The correct answer is **A: Tlhahlobo ya leihlo (Eye exam)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kgetha go dira tlhahlobo ya leihlo ka gae..."" which translates to ""Choose to have an eye exam at home...""  It also emphasizes the importance of this, especially if insurance covers it or if instructed to do so.  The passage highlights potential issues with eyeglasses purchased abroad, making an eye exam crucial before relying on them.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Diforeime tša maina a godimo tša dikgalase tša mahlo (Eyeglasses frames):** While mentioned as a potential issue, the passage focuses on the *need for an exam* before getting or relying on new frames.
*   **C: Inšorense ya mahlo (Eye insurance):**  Insurance is a factor, but the primary recommendation is to get an exam.
*   **D: Diforeime tša dikgalase tša mahlo tša go hloka maina (Rimless eyeglasses frames):** This is a specific type of frame and not the overarching recommendation.



Therefore, an eye exam is the most important step to take when purchasing eyeglasses, particularly when buying them abroad."
Kotsi ya go reka diforeimi tša maina a godimo tša dikgalase tša mahlo nageng ya ka ntle e ka ba efe?,"The correct answer is **C: E ka ba e se tša nnete (They might not be genuine).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diforeime tša maina a godimo mafelong a mabjale di ka ba le mathata a mabedi; tšedingwe e kaba bofora, gomme tša nnete tšeo di rekilwego ka ntle di ka thura kudu go feta gae.""  This translates to: ""The top-quality frames in the lower corners can have two problems; some may be fake, and the genuine ones bought abroad can be very expensive.""

Option C directly reflects this statement about the possibility of the frames being fake.  Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Go ka nyakega ditlhahlobo tša tlaleletšo tša mahlo (Eye examination might be needed):** While an eye exam *might* be needed, the passage focuses on the potential for counterfeit frames, not the necessity of an exam.
* **B: Lengwalo la ngaka le ka no se šome go diforeimi tše dingwe (The doctor's prescription might not cover other frames):** The passage doesn't mention prescriptions or coverage.
* **D: Inšorense e ka no se di lefelele (Insurance might not cover them):** The passage mentions insurance potentially covering *genuine* frames bought abroad, but doesn't state it won't cover frames in general.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and directly supported answer from the provided text.

"Mabapi le go šomiša tšhelete go la Falklands, gare ga mafoko a ke lefe leo le bolelago nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Dipound tša Falkland di swanetše go fetolwa pele o tloga dihlakahlakeng.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Tšhelete ya Falklands ke pound ya Falkland (FKP) yeo boleng bja yona bo betšwego go lekana le British pound ye tee (GBP). ... ka ntle ga dihlakahlaka, kafao fetola tšhelete pele o sepela dihlakahlakeng.""  This means you *must* exchange Falkland Pounds before using them outside of Stanley.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dikarata tša sekoloto le dipound tša Britain ke tšona feela di amogelwago dihlakahlakeng tša ka ntle** - The text says US dollars are *also* frequently accepted.
* **B: Stanley ke lefelo le nnoši leo le tla amogelago ditolara tša United States** - The text says US dollars are *frequently* accepted, not that Stanley *always* accepts them.
* **D: Ntle le pound ya Falkland, ka tlwaelo pound ya Britain ke yona yeo e amogelwago kudu** - The text states Falkland Pounds and British Pounds are *equivalent* in value. It doesn't say British Pounds are more widely accepted.

Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the provided text.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ge o le Falklands o etšwa United States, ke kae moo mokgwa wa go lefa ntle le karata ya sekoloto o ka šomago?","The correct answer is **A: Lebenkeleng la Bodikela bja FIC**.

The passage states: ""Tšhelete e ka fetolelana pankeng ya dihlakahlakeng fela tšeo di lego Stanley go feta lebenkeleng la Bodikela bja FIC."" (Money can only be exchanged between currencies available in Stanley at the FIC Bank.)

While US dollars and some other currencies are sometimes accepted, the primary and guaranteed place to exchange currency is at the FIC Bank.
"
Ke tiragalo efe yeo e sa amanywego le go ketekwa ga meletlo ya tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tswalwa ga tlou (Birth of a Cow)**.

The passage states that many temple festivals are celebrated annually from late November to May, varying each year. These festivals are often part of the temple's annual celebrations, a child's birthday festival, or another major event related to the temple. It specifically mentions the Kerala temple festival as being known for its tradition of trained elephants, temple decorations, and other rituals.

The question asks which event is *not* associated with the celebration of temple festivals. The passage explicitly mentions ""Segopotšo sa ngwaga sa tempele (temple's annual celebration),"" ""Letšatši la matswalo la modingwana (child's birthday festival),"" and ""Tiragalo yenngwe le yenngwe ye kgolo ya go amana le tempele (another major event related to the temple).""  While elephants are prominent in Kerala festivals, the passage doesn't associate the ""birth of a cow"" with temple festivals in general. Therefore, it's the correct answer.



"
Ditlou tše di kgabišitšwego di ka bonwa kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka ditempeleng (In temples)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bontši bja mekete ya tempele bo ketekwa bjalo ka karolo ya segopotšo sa ngwaga sa tempele...Meletlo ya tempele ya Kerala go a kgahliša go e bona, ka go tshepedišo ya tlwaelo ya ditlou tšeo di kgabišitšwego, diphatla tša tempele..."".  This directly links the caged birds to the temple ceremonies and temple practices.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gohle go thoma ka mafelelo a November go fihla gare ga May (Throughout November to May):** While this describes the time period of the temple markets, it doesn't specify *where* the caged birds are found.
*   **C: Melokelokeng ya meletlo ya tempele (In temple rituals):** While the birds are part of the rituals, the passage says they are *seen* in temples, implying a physical presence.
*   **D: Diterateng tša Kerala (In the forests of Kerala):** The passage focuses specifically on Kerala temples, not the forests of Kerala.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mokgwa ofe go yeo e latelago e lego tsela e kgonegago ya go boloka tšhelete ka gare ga legoro la pele goba la kgwebo ka sefofaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Go lefa ka khamphani ya gago**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of considering ""underground costs"" in starting a business. Option A, ""Go lefa ka khamphani ya gago"" (Registering your company), directly addresses these hidden costs.  Registering a company involves legal fees, administrative requirements, and other expenses that are often overlooked when initially planning a business.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Go beeletša madulo a legoro la pele go e na le la tša kgwebo** (Putting the first year's profits into the business): While reinvesting profits is good, it doesn't address the initial costs that need to be considered *before* the profits are generated.
* **C: Go beeletša madulo sefofaneng seo se sa yego thwii sa legoro la pele** (Putting the first year's profits into a separate account): Similar to B, this focuses on profit management, not initial cost awareness.
* **D: Go hwetša phokoletšo** (Finding funding):  Funding is important, but the passage stresses the importance of understanding *all* the costs before seeking funding. It doesn't address the costs themselves.



Therefore, registering the company (Option A) is the most logical next step to manage finances effectively and account for all the initial costs.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo e tla bago tshenyo ya nako ge o beeletša madulo a legoro le itšego difofaneng?","The correct answer is **D: Madulo a legoro la pele** (Startup expenses).

Here's why:

The text highlights that a significant pitfall for first-time entrepreneurs is underestimating the upfront costs.  It mentions needing money for things like location, equipment, and potentially hiring staff.  ""Madulo a legoro la pele"" directly refers to these initial costs a startup needs to cover.  The text implies these are often underestimated and can be a major reason for failure.
"
Ke eng seo se sa swanelago go tlaleletšwa ge go bapetšwa tšhelete ka moka ya sefofane sa go ya Afrika le tšhelete ya go ralala lefase?,"The correct answer is **D: Ditefelo tša senamelwa sa fase sa go ya mafelong a ka ntle ga Afrika.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hlola gore palomoka ya tefelo ya gago ya go ya Afrika e bapetšega bjang le tefelo ya go ralala lefase. Ge o na le nako ya tlaleletšo ya go etela, hlola gore o se lebala go tlaleletša ditefelo tša tlaleletšo tša di-visa tša tlaleletšo, **metšhelo ya go sepela, dinamelwa tša fase, bjbj. ditefelo tša mafelo ao kamoka a ka ntle ga Afrika.**""

Option D directly reflects this statement. The passage emphasizes checking travel requirements *outside* of Africa, specifically mentioning customs and potentially other travel arrangements. The other options are not mentioned in the passage as essential things to check when traveling to Africa and around the world.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke dilo dife tša mehutahuta tšeo mabenkele a dijo a thomago go di rekiša?","The correct answer is **A: Dijo tše di šetšego di dirilwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go reka mabenkeleng ka setlwaedi ke tsela ya theko ya fase kudu ya go ja. Ntle le menyetla ya go apea, dikgetho e ba tša dijo di šetšego di dirilwe.""  This translates to: ""Shopping in discount stores is the cheapest way to eat. Besides the ability to cook, choices are prepared foods.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions that prepared foods are a key offering in discount stores.  The other options are either implied or incorrect:

* **B: Diobene tša go tutetša dijo** (Cooking ingredients) - While you *can* buy cooking ingredients, the passage emphasizes *prepared* foods as a primary offering in discount stores.
* **C: Mabenkele a go jela a gona moo** (Restaurants are available there) - The passage mentions the *ability to cook* as an alternative to eating out, suggesting restaurants aren't a defining feature of discount stores.
* **D: Ditheko tša fase kudu** (Very cheap prices) -  The passage mentions cheap prices, but it doesn't say that *prices* are what stores *start* buying. It states that *shopping* there is the cheapest way to eat.



"
Ke eng seo mabenkele a mengwe a fanago ka sona seo se ka kgahlago batho bao ba rekago dijo tše di šetšego di apeilwe?,"The correct answer is **D: Obene ya go tutetša dijo (Variety of food)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka go oketšega mabenkele a dijo a oketšega ka go fapana ga karolo ya dijo tšeo di aeilwego. Tšedingwe ebile di abelana ka obene ya go tutetša goba mekgwa ye mengwe ya go tutetša dijo."" This translates to ""Generally, food stores are distinguished by the variety of food items they sell. Some also specialize in or share a variety of ways to prepare food.""

This directly indicates that a key offering of many food stores is the variety of food they provide. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mabenkele a go jela a gona moo (Restaurants are available there):** While some stores *might* have restaurants, the passage focuses on the variety of food items sold, not the availability of restaurants.
*   **B: Go kgetha go dilo tše sego kae tša go fapana (Choosing from fewer unique things):** This is the opposite of what the passage says.
*   **C: Dijo tše di sego tša apewa (Prepared foods are sold):** The passage mentions prepared foods, but highlights the *variety* of food items available overall.



"
Ke selo sefe go tšeo di latelago seo se ka no se kwešišwego ke batho ba go bolela se-French ba Belgium le Switzerland?,"The correct answer is **B: Mantšu a itšego a se-French**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is similar to that in France, there are ""other specific differences in the vocabulary"" (mantšu a itšego a kgethegilego).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Tshepedišo ya dinomoro ya se-French:** The passage mentions differences in number phrases (""tshepedišo ya dinomoro""), but the question asks about *what* might be misunderstood. While differences exist, it's not the primary focus of the passage regarding potential misunderstandings.
* **C: Mmiletšo wa mantšu a itšego a se-French:** The passage focuses on vocabulary differences, not grammatical variations (mmiletšo).
* **D: Se-French seo se bolelwago kudu go la France:** The passage emphasizes that the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is *different* from the French spoken in France.  Therefore, it's *not* what might be misunderstood – it's the *differences* that could cause misunderstanding.



"
Ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se swanago go la Belgium goba Switzerland efela se fapane go la France?,"The correct answer is **B: Tshepedišo ya dinomoro**.

The text explicitly states that ""Kudu-kudu, tshepedišo ya dinomoro go la Belgium yeo go bolelwago se-French le Switzerland e na le dika tše dingwe tše itšego tše kgethegilego tša go fapana go tšwa go se-Freche seo se bolelwago go la France..."" which translates to ""Furthermore, the numbering system in French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland has other specific differences from French spoken in France..."" The other options are either not mentioned as differences or are presented as similarities.

Ke neng moo o ka se abelwego mašeleng a go namela sefofane ge o hlokofaletšwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ge o ka leka go beakanya madulo thwii le khamphane ya difofane go e na le go a beeletša ka batho ba bangwe.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bakeng ka moka, o swanetše o beakanye ka mogala thwii le khamphane ya sefofane.""  This means you should try to book through a third party when you are experiencing issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ge o fofa ka WestJet:** The passage mentions WestJet as one of the airlines that *sometimes* has issues, but it doesn't specify where you can get compensation.
*   **C: Ge e ba o fofa Lufthansa go tšwa Paris go ya United States:** This is just an example flight and doesn't relate to where you get compensation.
*   **D: Ge o fofa go ya Delta:** Similar to option A, Delta is mentioned as one airline that has problems but doesn't specify where to seek compensation.



"
Nnete ke efe ka tšhelete ya go lefela sefofane ge o hlokofaletšwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba lefela ditefelo tša go ya polokong** (They refund the cost of the ticket).

The text states: ""Mašeleng a go hlokofalelwa, difofane tšeo di abelanago ka tše diakaretša Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa bakeng sa difofane tša go tšwa go la U.S. goba Canada, le WestJet. Mabakeng ka moka, o swanetše o beakanye ka mogala thwii le khamphane ya sefofane.""  This means if you're affected by delays, you should first contact the airline.  While the text doesn't explicitly state a refund, the context implies that airlines are obligated to compensate passengers for significant disruptions.  Option A is the most accurate and commonly understood compensation for flight delays.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sefofane se swanetše go beeletšwa thwii wepesaeteng ya difofane tše bjalo** (The airline should be listed on a website for such airlines): This isn't about compensation for delays.
* **C: Ba lefela ditshenyagalelo tša go sepela ka motsotso wa mafelelo** (They refund the expenses of staying overnight due to a delay): While airlines *might* cover overnight expenses, the primary compensation for the flight itself is usually a refund or rebooking.
* **D: Sefofane se swanetše go beeletšwa thwii ka go se founela** (The airline should be contacted by phone):  The text says to contact the airline *first*, not that they *should be listed* somewhere.
"
Ke neng moo go šomiša GPS ya godimo ga founo ya gago go lego kaone go phala go šomiša sedirišwa sa go ikema ka noši sa GPS?,"The correct answer is **A: Ge o leka go boloka tšhelete**.

Here's why:

The passage states that using the GPS on your phone can save money by avoiding the need to buy, rent, or subscribe to a dedicated GPS device or service.  Therefore, the reason someone might *choose* to use the phone's GPS instead of a dedicated device is to save money.
"
Ke lebaka lefe le lebotse la go šomiša GPS godimo ga founo ya gago go e na le go šomiša sedirišwa sa go ikema ka noši sa GPS?,"The correct answer is **A: Go se nyake go hlwa o belaela ka kgokaganyo ya inthanete (You don't have to rely on an internet connection)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that one of the advantages of using GPS on your phone is that it doesn't require an internet connection.  This is a key difference from dedicated GPS devices.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Go boloka tšhelete (Saving money):** While using GPS on your phone *can* save money (avoiding buying a dedicated GPS device or renting one), it's not the *primary* reason the text highlights it as an advantage over dedicated GPS units.
* **C: Go phema go hiriša (Avoiding renting):** This is a secondary benefit, but the lack of internet dependence is more fundamental.
* **D: Go se hlwe o swanelwa ke go reka mebepe ye meswa (Not having to buy maps):**  While phones have built-in maps, the lack of internet is still a critical consideration, as map updates might require internet access.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, o ka netefatša bjang gore o hweditše sekepe sa maleba?","The correct answer is **C: Go beeletša ka motho wa go šoma maeto a Galapogos**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states, ""Netefatša gore moemedi yoo o dirago dipeelo ka yena ke setsebi sa Galapagos ka tsebo ye botse ya dikepe tša go fapafapana.""  This means you need to rely on the knowledge of someone who works on the Galapagos Islands.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Go beeletša sehlopheng sa banamedi ba 8+ bao wena le bona le kgahlegelago dilo tša go swana:** While observing similar things is helpful, it doesn't guarantee you've found a reputable boat.
* **B: Go beeletša sehleng seo e sego sa leemaema:**  The location of the boat isn't the primary factor in determining its reliability.
* **D: Go beeletša e sa le ka pela kudu:** Being further away doesn't help you assess the boat's credibility.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se sa šomišwego e le leano la go dira gore baeti ba tšwele pele ba petšha?","The correct answer is **C: Dino tša mahala (Free food)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that casinos offer ""dijo tša makgethe, dino le meneelo ya boithabišo"" which translates to ""cheap food, drinks, and hospitality"". This is a direct incentive to keep people playing and spending money.  The other options aren't mentioned or implied in the text as reasons for casinos to encourage gambling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Seetša se se ntšhi sa tlhago (A new, sophisticated system):** While casinos use technology, the passage doesn't mention specific technological upgrades as a way to keep players gambling.
* **B: Tlhohleletšo ya go swana le dithekete tša mahala tša moletlo wa mmino (A promotion similar to free concert tickets):** The passage doesn't mention any promotions like free concert tickets.
* **D: Go se be gona ga dišupanako (There being no delays):** While delays *can* happen, the passage focuses on the *presence* of incentives like food and drinks, not the *absence* of delays.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, motho yo bohlale wa go petšha o swanetše go phema eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go nwa madila kudu** (To drink alcohol heavily).

Here's why:

The passage states that casinos are designed to encourage guests to spend a lot of time and money. It mentions enticing things like gourmet food, drinks, and luxurious amenities, designed to make people feel special and encourage them to stay longer. It also notes that some gamblers share stories of their losses with shame, and that smart gamblers know the importance of not drinking.

Therefore, the passage implies that heavy drinking is a key tactic casinos use to encourage spending and lose control. Option A directly reflects this implication. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke karolo efe ya polelo yeo e ngwalwago ka ditlhaka tše dikgolo gare ga lefoko?","The correct answer is **A: Madiri**.

The passage describes a ""maina ka moka"" (a certain part of a word) that is large and at the beginning of the word. This describes a **prefix**, which is a type of morpheme (the smallest meaningful unit of language) that is added to the beginning of a word to change its meaning.  ""Madiri"" translates to ""prefixes"" in English.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, go ngwalwa ga maina ka ditlhaka tše dikgolo go ka dira gore eng e be thata le go feta?","The correct answer is **C: Go ngwala**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""go ngwala go hlakahlakane ka tsela yenngwe hloko ya go nyaka go hwetša ge e ba le diri goba lehlaodi le šomišitšwa ka tsela ya maleba naa."" This translates to ""writing is difficult in another way, a difficulty one needs to look for when it is a diacritic or a dieresis is used in a certain way.""  Therefore, the passage directly links the use of diacritics (like maina) to difficulty in writing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go bala (Reading):** The passage says maina *makes* reading easier.
*   **B: Go bona pharologanyo magareng ga madiri (Seeing the relationship between words):** The passage states maina is important for showing relationships between words.
*   **D: Go bona pharologanyo magareng ga dilo (Seeing relationships between things):** While the passage mentions relationships between ""madiri le dilo tše dingwe"" (things and other things), it doesn't specifically link maina to seeing relationships between *things*.

Therefore, the passage highlights writing as the most difficult aspect affected by using maina."
"Dinagamagaeng tša Malaysia, ke seka sefe seo se bolelago gore “etla”?","The correct answer is **A: Go koba monwana wa bone (to kill someone)**.

The text explicitly states: ""go la Malaysia, bonnyane gare ga ma Malays dinagamagaeng, se bolela gore """"""etla,"""""""" go tswana le monwana wa go šupa ge o kobetšwe go iša mmeleng..."" which translates to ""In Malaysia, among the Malays, it means 'etla' is the act of killing someone...""
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke seka sefe seo se ka bolelago gore “boela morago”?","The correct answer is **A: Go hwidihwitša letsogo seatla moyeng ga go ba le bokagare bja seatla go lebeletše yoo a laelago.**

Here's why:

The passage says: ""Ka go tswana, moeti wa mo-Britain go la Spain a ka tšea go laelwa ga go hwidihwitša letsogo moyeng ga go ba le bokagare bja seatla go lebeletše yoo a laelago (gona le motho yo a laelwago) bjalo ka seka sa gore a boele morago."" 

This directly links ""boele morago"" (to return) with the action of regaining sanity/clearness of mind (""go hwidihwitša letsogo seatla moyeng"") after experiencing a state of being captivated by a desire (""bokagare bja seatla go lebeletše yoo a laelago"").  It's implying that returning to sanity is like returning from a captivated state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go koba monwana wa bone** (To rob them): This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Go hwidihwitša letsogo seatla se lebeletše ka ntle** (To regain sanity outside): The passage specifies regaining sanity *within* the mind (""moyeng"").
* **D: Go dumela ka hlogo** (To agree headfirst): This is not related to the passage's discussion of regaining sanity after being captivated by a desire.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, meepo e megolo ya lehlwa e hlolwa ke eng?","The correct answer is **A: Magora a lehlwa**.

The text states: ""Maboto le dihlaka tša mawa a lehlwa a ka wa le go pharoga a ka tswalelwa."" This translates to ""Mice and rat droppings can cause a disease that can lead to swelling."" It then says ""Meepo e megolo ya lehlwa e hlolwa ke magora a lehlwa"" which means ""Large rat droppings are checked for rat droppings."" Therefore, the large rat droppings are checked for rat droppings.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sefe sa dilo tše seo se ka utwago ke magora a lehlwa?","The correct answer is **A: Meepo**.

The passage states: ""Meepo, yeo e ka thibjwago ke magora a lehlwa."" which translates to ""Boils, which can be prevented by ringworm.""
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, baeti ba swanetše ba šedi kudu pele ba etela mafelo afe?","The correct answer is **A: Leraga la go fiša la Nyiragongo**.

The text explicitly states that Goma was devastated in 2002 by the eruption of the Nyiragongo lava lake, which destroyed much of the town and its center. Therefore, visitors should be aware of the Nyiragongo lava lake.
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo o ka se se botšego motho wa go etela go la Goma?,"The correct answer is **B: Ke lefelo la maleba la dilo tša go rekega tša go tsoma di Gorilla Dithabeng**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Motse gape ke motheo bakeng sa go namelela go ya lerang la go fuša la Nyiragongo gammogo le go latišetša ga teko ya fase ga Mountain Gorilla go la Afrika."" This translates to ""The town is also a hub for access to the Nyiragongo lava flow and the monitoring of Mountain Gorilla ground surveys in Africa.""
* This makes Goma a key location for gorilla trekking expeditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dintwa tša Leboa la Kivu di tloša bodutu** - While North Kivu has volcanoes, the text doesn't highlight this as a major attraction for visitors specifically to Goma.
* **C: Ditekisi tša thuthu ke tsela ye botse ya go sepela-sepela fao** - The text mentions taxis are available but doesn't say they are the ""best"" way to travel.
* **D: Botlase bja thabamollo ya Nyiragongo bo toropong** - The text *does* mention the Nyiragongo lava flow, but it doesn't say the *base* of the volcano is *in* the town. It mentions access to the lava flow.



"
Tumelelo ya bomorago bja naga letšatšing la pele ka August e tla hwetšagalago neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka 1 January**.

The text states: ""Kafao, thumelelo ya bomorago bja naga bakeng sa letšatšikgwedi le lengwe le lengwe la go thoma ka May e ba gona ka 1 Jan."" (However, backcountry permits for each week starting in May are available on January 1st.)

Since August is *after* May, the permit for the first week of August would be available on January 1st.
"
Ke molao ofe wo o beilwego go šireletša maope?,"The correct answer is **A: Sediba ke sa motlapele tabeng ya tumelelo** (The answer is not stated in the context).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ditumelelo di beetšwe go šireletša maope..."" which translates to ""Permits are issued to protect the wilderness...""

The question asks *what law* was put in place to protect the wilderness. The passage doesn't name a specific law, but rather explains the *purpose* of the permit system - to protect the wilderness. Option A best reflects this by stating that the information isn't provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tumelelo e ba gona feela ka 1 January** - The passage says permits for the following four weeks are issued *one day* before the start of the four weeks.
* **C: Tumelelo e ka hwetšwa feela ka go e kgopela ka namana** - The passage mentions that permits for campgrounds like Bright Angel Campground and Phantom Ranch are often obtained through lottery. This contradicts option C.
* **D: Palo ya diumelelo e lekanyeditšwe** - The passage doesn't mention that the number of permits is limited.
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago se go nago le kgonagalo e nyenyane ya gore se hwetšwe dihoteleng tše di boletšwego karolong ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Diphaphoši tše di mpshafaditšwego le go kaonefatšwa ka dilo tša sebjalebjale** (Elaborate furnishings and decorated with plants).

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions ""Dikagare tša sekgale, go hloka di dirišwa tša sebjabjale, le botšofe bjo bo itšego bja mogau ke karolo ya dimelo tša bona"" which translates to ""Notable features, the use of elaborate furnishings, and a sense of luxuriousness were part of them."" This directly relates to elaborate furnishings and decorations.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Lefelo la go nwela bjala** (The way to obtain money): While wealthy travelers stayed in these hotels, the text doesn't focus on *how* they obtained money.
*   **B: Lebenkele la go jela** (A restaurant): The text mentions that food was available, but doesn't highlight a *restaurant* as a key feature.
*   **C: Baengmmogo bao ba tsebegago goba go lemogega** (Companions who are known to be famous): The text mentions that some hotels accommodated visiting dignitaries and nobles, but it doesn't emphasize the importance of *famous companions*.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate reflection of a specific feature highlighted in the provided text.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimošo ya karolong ye, ke dilo dife tšeo go nago le kgonagalo e nyenyane ya gore baeng ba di etiše pele?","The correct answer is **C: Lefelo la boiketlo la go ba le boithabišo bja bošego (The feeling of luxury and health)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dikagare tša sekgale, go hloka di dirišwa tša sebjabjale, le botšofe bjo bo itšego bja mogau ke karolo ya dimelo tša bona.""  This translates to: ""Remarkable amenities, including private bathrooms and luxurious comfort, were part of their features.""

The other options are not directly supported by the text:

* **A: Mekgabišo ya kgale ya maemo moagong ka moka (Ancient grandeur of a specific location):** While the hotels were impressive, the text doesn't emphasize a specific location's ancient grandeur.
* **B: Lefelo la go jela la go ba le moapei wa go tsebega (The way of dining with a lavish spread):** While they ate well, the passage doesn't focus on the *way* they dined or the lavishness of the spreads.
* **D: Ditefo tša tlase tša diphaphoši (Lower-class funeral rites):** This is completely unrelated to the passage, which discusses luxury hotels and wealthy travelers.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo batho bao ba etetšego Greenland ba swanetšego go se phema?","The correct answer is **B: Go tla le dikobo tša marega, ka ge go phela go fiša ngwaga ka moka.**

The text explicitly states: ""Ge o ka etela Greenland ka nako ya dihla tša go tonya (o gopola gore ge o ntše o eya leboa, go tonya kudu), go bohlokwa go tla le dikobo tša borutho."" (If you visit Greenland during the winter (note that the further north you go, the more it snows), it is important to bring warm clothing.)

While option A mentions the ""mafelo a bothata"" (difficult terrains) and option C mentions the importance of internet connectivity, the text directly focuses on the need for warm clothing due to the cold winter conditions. Option D is incorrect as the text discusses the term ""Eskimo"" but doesn't say visitors need to avoid using it.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago e ka bago bothata go batho bao ba etetšego Greenland ba se ba itokiša botse?","The correct answer is **C: Maemo a leratadima (Cold weather)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ge o ka etela Greenland ka nako ya dihla tša go tonya (o gopola gore ge o ntše o eya leboa, go tonya kudu), go bohlokwa gore o tla le dikobo tša borutho."" (If you visit Greenland during the winter (remember that when you go north, it's very cold), you need to bring warm clothes.)

While other options are mentioned, the cold weather and the need for warm clothing are highlighted as a potential problem for unprepared visitors.  The text also mentions potentially difficult ""mafelo a bothata"" (difficult situations) but doesn't specify what they are, making cold weather the most directly addressed potential problem.
"
Ke lefelo lefe leo gabjale le šomišwago e le sentara ya plaza?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text explicitly states: ""Gabjale e šoma bjalo ka sentara ya plaza, gomme..."" which translates to ""It now works as a plaza center, and..."" The ""it"" refers to Jardín de la Unión.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe go tšeo di latelago seo se sego gona go la Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: Morithi wa tente ya diponagatšo**.

The text explicitly states that ""mathapameng le bošego go ba le diponagatšo tša go se lefelwe tšeo di fiwago gantši go tšwa morithing wa tente."" This means the tent's fragrance is *found* in the plaza, not *present* there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Legae la kakapa ya go tšofala ya lerato:** The text directly mentions ""Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss)"" and describes it as the legend of a falling out of love.
* **C: Mafelo a go jela a go dukuluga tšhemo:** The text states ""Go na le mafelo a go jela a mmalwa go dukuluga tšhemo"" - there are a few drinking fountains around the edges.
* **D: Moago wa kgale wa kopano:** The text mentions the Jardín de la Unión used to be the site of a meeting, but that it's now a lively place with many activities.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago mabapi le go namela dithaba mosegare le ka bonwago le fošagetše?","The correct answer is **C: Motho o mongwe le o mongwe wa go itekanela ga botse a ka ipšhina ka tšona**.

The sentence following ""Go ya go namela dithaba ka tselajana ye nnyane ye bonolo go hlokega ditokišetšo tše di nnyane"" is ""Motho o mongwe le o mongwe wa go itekanela ga botse a ka ipšhina ka tšona."" This directly relates to the ease of using the equipment mentioned earlier.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ya go namela dithaba ka tselajana ye nnyane ye bonolo go hlokega ditokišetšo tše di nnyane:** This is the sentence *before* the one being asked about.
* **B: Dikgoba di a fapana, efela di ka fihlelelwa ka letšatši le tee:** While related to hiking, this doesn't directly follow the previous sentence about equipment.
* **D: Go namela dithaba mosegare ga se gwa lokela malapa a bana ba bannyane:** This is a statement not supported by the text and contradicts the idea that families with young children can also benefit from hiking.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke neng mo go namela dithaba mosegare go hlokago ditokišetšo tše di nnyane?","The correct answer is **B: Ge go namelwa dithaba ka tselajana ye nnyane ye bonolo**.

The passage states: ""Go namela dithaba mosegare go akaretša dikgoba tša ka fase ga khilomitara go fihla go dikgoba tše ditelele tšeo di ka fihlelelwago ka letšatši le tee. **Go namela dithaba ka tselajana ye nnyane ye bonolo go hlokega ditokišetšo tše di nnyane, gomme motho o mongwe le o mongwe wa go itekanela ga botse a ka ipšhina ka tšona.**""

This clearly indicates that small, easy routes for evening walks require minimal equipment.
"
Dinagagodimo tša Rogaland goba Agder di fapana bjang le tša Norway ka moka?,"The correct answer is **D: Gantši e phela e khupeditšwe ke matšoba a go bitšwa heather.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Go la Rogaland le Agder di bitšwa """"""""hei"""""""" seo se rago re mohlaka wa go hloka mehlare woo gantši o khupeditšwego ke heather.""  This translates to ""In Rogaland and Agder it is called 'hei' which is a type of moorland that is heavily covered in heather.""
* The passage contrasts these areas with the rest of Norway, which are often described as ""vidde"" – vast, treeless plains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di na le mehlare:** While they *do* have moorland, the key difference highlighted is the prevalence of heather.  The passage doesn't say they simply *have* moorland.
* **B: Ga go na meedi:** The passage says they are ""vidde"" – treeless plains – implying they *lack* trees, not that there is *no* vegetation at all.
* **C: Naga ya gona gantši e lekalekane:** The passage states that Norway in general is often treeless, therefore the land in Rogaland and Agder does not commonly have a gentle slope.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo ka tlwaelo o ka se se hwetšego Norway?","The correct answer is **D: Moorlands**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the high plateaus in Norway are often called ""vidde,"" which are vast, treeless areas needing little drainage and lacking cattle. It then mentions that areas like Rogaland and Agder are called ""hei,"" which is a type of moorland covered in heather.

Therefore, based on the passage, moorlands are a characteristic landscape feature you would expect to find in Norway.
"
Ke neng mo batho ba go rata go thelela lehlweng ba swanetšego go etela ditiši tša mebotong?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka nako ya selemo sa India**.

The passage states: ""Sehla sa boeti bakeng sa ditiši tša meboto gantši bo tlala ka nako ya selemo sa India.""  This translates to: ""The celebration for the blossom of the trees usually occurs during the Indian New Year.""
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, gantši ke neng moo baeti ba bantši ba etelago ditiši tša mebotong?","The correct answer is **A: Ge lehlwa le ewa ka bontši**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sehla sa boeti bakeng sa ditiši tša meboto gantši bo tlala ka nako ya selemo sa India. Efela, ba na le bo botse le bogogedi bjo fapanego ka nako ya marega..."" This indicates that the festival is primarily associated with the Indian winter.  The text then goes on to say they welcome a large number of guests ""meboto e amogela lehlwa le le botse le lentši le go abelana ka mediro ya go swana le go fofa lehlweng le go kitima lehlweng."" This translates to ""the festival welcomes many guests and a lot of food and sharing traditions and dancing.""  The logical conclusion is that the largest influx of guests occurs when the harvest is plentiful (lehlwa le le botse - good harvest).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nakong ka moka ya sehla sa go thelela lehlweng** (During the main harvest season): While related, it's not as specific as ""when the harvest is abundant.""
*   **C: Ka nako ya selemo sa India** (During the Indian year): This is too broad. The passage specifies the *winter* of India.
*   **D: Dikgweding ka moka tša marega** (During the main winter months):  The passage emphasizes the abundance of the harvest *as* the key time for welcoming guests.



"
Ke’ng se o sa swanelago go se dira gore o hwetše sekepe ge o nyaka thušo?,"The correct answer is **A: Go ya godimo le fase mo sekepe se kgokwago gona**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a scenario where someone is trying to get help to find a boat.  The goal is to connect people who need boats with those who have them. Going ""godimo le fase"" (up and down) on a boat that's already in use is disruptive and wouldn't help anyone find a boat. The other options (C and D) are actually encouraged in the passage. The passage specifically states to offer help and connect people.
"
O swanetše go dira’ng ge o na le maphodisa a lewatleng ge a nyakana le sekepe sa go hloka thušo?,"The correct answer is **A: Dira boikgokaganyi le boradikepe**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a scenario where you are helping people find the right boats. The key strategy mentioned is to **spread the word and offer assistance to a wide range of people.**  This includes:

*   **Dira boikgokaganyi le boradikepe (Spread the word and network):** This aligns directly with the passage's emphasis on talking to many people and letting them know what kind of boat people need.  It's about actively creating connections and informing others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dula o le ka fase ga eriale (Stay low/be hidden):** This contradicts the passage's instruction to actively engage with people.
*   **C: Batamela batho ge feela ba hlwekiša dikepe tša bona (Help people only if they clean their boats):**  This is too restrictive. The passage says you should help *everyone* who needs assistance.
*   **D: Phema batho ba go swana le wena ba go leka go hwetša sekepe (Focus on people who are like you trying to find a boat):** This narrows the scope too much. The passage suggests you should reach out to *everyone* who needs a boat, not just people with similar goals.



"
Ke lefelo lefe leo le ka kgahlago moeti wa go kgahlegela histori ya sehlakahlaka ya mabapi le bokoloni?,"The correct answer is **C: Toropo ya Hong Kong**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tšwelopele ya bogolo bja seteropo ya Hong Kong Island e tletše godimo ga naga yeo e boeditšwego morago go la lebopo la leboa. Le ke lefelo leo bakoloni ba ma-British ba le tšerego bjalo ka la bona gomme kafoa ge eba o nyaka bohlatse bja bokgale bja lefelo la koloni, mo ke lefelo le le kaone la go thoma.""

This directly links the city of Hong Kong Island to the colonial history of the area, making it the best choice for someone interested in that aspect.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Lebopo la Leboa (North Point):**  While part of Hong Kong Island, the passage focuses on the *entire city* as a historical site.
* **B: Kowloon ga go ba le meetse go lebana le yona (Kowloon with the waterfront):** Kowloon is mentioned as a separate area, focusing on the harbor's beauty, not specifically its colonial history.
* **D: Victoria Harbor:** The harbor is beautiful and important, but the passage ties the city itself to the colonial history more strongly.



"
Ke lefelo lefe leo le ka kgahlago moeti wa go rata mafelo a mabotse kudu?,"The correct answer is **A: Victoria Harbour**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ponagatša ya meago yeo e dirago lratadima la Hong Kong e swantšitšwwe le tšhate ya go phadima yeo e bonagatšwago ke bogona bja meetse a Victoria Harbour."" (The skyline of Hong Kong is contrasted with the shimmering reflections seen in the waters of Victoria Harbour.) This indicates that Victoria Harbour is a prominent feature appealing to those who appreciate beautiful scenery. While the other options are parts of Hong Kong, Victoria Harbour is specifically mentioned in connection with beauty and visual appeal.
"
Disale tše dingwe di na le eng sa go thuša go fokotša kotsi ya gore leoto la monamedi wa pere le se kgakgelwe bogatong?,"The correct answer is **B: Dikarolo tša polokego**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""di-saddle, kudu tša English, di na le dikarolo tša polokego tšeo di dumelelago letlalo go wa go saddle ge e gogelwa morago ke mootledi yoo a wago.""  This directly translates to ""saddles, especially English saddles, have safety features that allow the rider to be able to saddle it when it is hit from behind by a falling horse.""

While the other options might be related to safety, the passage specifically highlights the *safety features* of the saddle itself as the key to preventing the horse from being trampled.
"
Ke karolo efe ya seeta sa go namela dipere yeo e oketšago go bokokega ga leoto la monamedi wa pere bogatong?,"The correct answer is **B: Letlalo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Di-saddle, kudu tša English, di na le dikarolo tša polokego tšeo di dumelelago letlalo go wa go saddle ge e gogelwa morago ke mootledi yoo a wago."" This translates to: ""Saddles, especially English saddles, have safety features that allow the rider to be saddle when it's bumped from behind by the horse.""  This directly points to the saddle's design protecting the rider's *back* from impact.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Solo ya makgwakgwa, ye sesane (Small stirrups):** Stirrups primarily help with balance and stability while riding, not specifically with protecting the back from being bumped.
*   **C: Serete (Helmet):** Helmets protect the head, not the back.
*   **D: Solo ya go bulega (Breastplate):** Breastplates are designed to prevent the saddle from sliding back, not to protect the rider's back from being bumped.



"
Ke eng seo se fiwago baeti dinetewekeng tša baamogedi ba baeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go dula le malapa ao a ba amogetšego (To stay with hosting families)**.

The passage explicitly states that the network connects guests with families who offer lodging. The other options are not mentioned as part of the initial offering of the network.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe mabapi le dineteweke tša baamogedi ba baeng leo e sego nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Dineteweke tše dingwe di ka nyaka kgonthišišo ya baeti ka makga a mangwe.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Dineteweke tše dingwe di aba goba di nyaka kgonthišišo ya tlaleletšo."" (Other networks may require verification.)
* Option B accurately reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka mehla baeti ba botšwa ka bao ba ba amogetšego:** The passage doesn't say this happens *always*. It mentions networks *share* host information online, but not necessarily that guests are *always* asked.
* **C: Baeti ba tla fiwa maina a baamogela baeng bao ba lego toropong ye ba yago go yona:** The passage describes a system where people *offer* accommodation, not that guests are *given* hosts.
* **D: Ka dinako tše dingwe baeti ba ka hlahloba baamogela baeng ba mo ba yago gona:** The passage doesn't mention guests having the ability to check on their hosts.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke moeti ofe yo go ka diregago gore a se hwetšwe ka phaphušing ya batho ba babedi ya hostele?","The correct answer is **B: Moeti wa go sepela a nnoši (Older male guest)**.

Here's why:

The question asks who is *likely* to be found in a hotel with a younger female guest, according to the text. The text explicitly states: ""Dihostele di a ba dumelela ka diphaphušing tša bona tša noši"" which translates to ""Hotels allow them in their single rooms"" referring to older male guests. Therefore, an older male guest is the most plausible answer.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke bomang go nago le kgonagalo e kgolo ya gore ba dule hostele?","The correct answer is **B: Batho ba bararo ba mengwaga e 22 ba go sepela mmogo**.

The text states: ""Dihostele di hlokomela bonnyane batho ba baswa - moeti wa mengwaga ye e ka bago ye masomepedi - efela gantši o ka hwetša le baeti ba bagolo gona moo gape."" This indicates the hostels are often frequented by young people in their 20s.  The text also mentions that families are less common, but some hostels allow them. Option B best reflects the age group most commonly found.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago le hlalosago ka nepo go fošwa ga boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: E tla dula e boela seatleng sa gago ge e ba o e fošitše gabotse** (It will come back to your hand if you throw it properly).

Here's why:

* The paragraph talks about how many people want to throw a boomerang and the challenges involved. 
* The key to a successful throw, and the reason it comes back, is throwing it ""gabotse"" (properly). 
* Option A directly addresses the question of how a boomerang can come back, and it's the logical conclusion from the information given.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E tsebja kudu ke badudi go feta baeng** (It is mostly known by women than men) - This is irrelevant to how a boomerang works.
* **C: Ga go na di boomerang tše dintši Australia** (There are not many boomerangs in Australia) - This contradicts the initial statement that boomerangs are popular.
* **D: Ke di boomerang tše dingwe feela tše di kgonago go boela morago** (Only some boomerangs are able to come back) - This is true, but it doesn't explain *how* a boomerang comes back when thrown properly.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that directly answers the question about how a boomerang can come back.
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se šomišwago kudu dijong tša Javanese?,"The correct answer is **C: Swikiri ya coconut**.

The text explicitly states: ""...mokgwa wa go apea wa Javanese o na le phapano ya dijo tše di nokilwego bonolo, ditatso tša Javanes e le dimake, **tšhilisi, swikiri (kudu swikiri ya Javanese ya coconut)** le di-spice tša go fapana tša go nkgelela.""

Therefore, ""swikiri ya coconut"" is directly mentioned as a key component of Javanese cuisine.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, bolwetši bja go fetela bo phatlalala bjang?","The correct answer is **B: Ditwatši**.

The passage states: ""Bolwetši bja go fetla ke boo bo hlotšwego ke twatši..."" which translates to ""The disease of leakage is caused by bacteria...""

While bacteria *are* a cause of leakage, the question asks *what* causes it, and the passage directly identifies bacteria as the causative agent.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Batho bao bo ba swerego (Swimmers):** Swimmers can *contract* leakage, but they don't *cause* it.
* **C: Bakteriam (Bacteria):** Bacteria are *a type* of cause, but the passage specifies the causative agent as bacteria.
* **D: Meento (Vaccines):** Vaccines are used to *prevent* leakage, not cause it.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo go sa tsebjego se hlola bolwetši bja go fetela?","The correct answer is **A: Meento (Viruses)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bolwetši bja go fetela ke boo bo hlotšwego ke twatši, bjalo ka kokwanahloko, bakteriam, fungus goba diphelakadingwe tše dingwe.""  This translates to: ""The disease of mutation is caused by viruses, and sometimes, bacteria, fungus or other microorganisms.""

Therefore, the question asks what *specifically* (according to the text) causes the disease of mutation, and the text identifies **viruses (meento)** as one of the causes.

Ke maemong afe moo go kgetha web proxy legatong la tirelo ya motho ka noši ya VPN go tla bago kaone go modiriši wa inthanete?,"The correct answer is **B: Modiriši o tshwenyegile ka go phema ka mokgo a ka kgonago taba ya go thibelwa le go bonwa ga diphiri tša gagwe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that VPNs are superior to proxies for security and privacy.**  It highlights that VPNs encrypt traffic and mask IP addresses, making it much harder to track a user's online activity.
* **Option B directly reflects this benefit.** Users who are concerned about being tracked and monitored online are the ones who would benefit most from a VPN's stronger security.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Modiriši o nyaka go boetša tseleng moelo o montši wa inthanete:** While VPNs *do* offer access to a broader range of the internet, that's a secondary benefit compared to the primary security focus. Proxies can also offer broader access.
* **C: Modiriši o boetša tseleng moelo o montši wa http:**  The passage specifically says VPNs are better than proxies *even for HTTP*. It's not just about accessing a wider range of HTTP sites.
* **D: Se modiriši a se dirago inthaneteng se nyaka neteweke ya magareng go iša go ya go matlafala kudu:** This is a technical description, but it doesn't highlight the *user's motivation* for using a VPN.  While it's true that VPNs can improve internet speeds in some cases, the core driver is privacy and security.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago mabapi le di VPN le di proxy tša di wepesate e sego nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Di VPN di di abelana ka bendwith ya godimo go feta di proxy tša di wepesate.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Gantši di abelana ka bendwith ya godimo le tirelo ye kaone ya go tia."" which translates to ""They share higher bandwidth and faster connection."" referring to VPNs.
* Option A accurately reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di proxy tša di wepesate ga di kgone go boetša moelo o montši wa inthanete:** The text says the opposite - VPNs can browse a wider range of internet protocols.
* **C: Di proxy tša di wepesate di na le ditirelo tša go fokola ge di bapetšwa le di VPN:**  The text says VPNs are more secure and harder to monitor than proxy servers.
* **D: Di VPN di kgona feela go boetša tseleng moelo o montši wa http:** The text says VPNs can browse a wider range of protocols.

Ke eng sa go dumelela motho go šomiša mogala wa khamphane a se mo a dulago gona?,"The correct answer is **A: Megala ya go laolwa ka inthaneteng (Internet-based phone systems)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la gore ka baka la"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se ka swanelwago ke go dirwa gore o kgone go amogela megala e itšego?","The correct answer is **A: O ka reka nomorofase**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gantši, o swanetše o reke nomorofase theko yeo e dumelelago dillathekeng tša PSTN go go letšetša.""  This translates to ""Often, you need to buy a number package that allows access to PSTN networks to receive calls.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O ka šomiša mogala wa khamphane wa selegae:** The passage explicitly says it doesn't matter where the company's server is located.
* **C: O ka hwetša nomoro ya selegae go tšwa motseng wo o dulago go wona:** While technically possible, the passage points out that the location of the number is irrelevant to the recipient.
* **D: O ka reka sellathekeng sa PSTN:**  The passage mentions access *through* PSTN networks, but doesn't say you need to buy the technology itself.  It's the *access* that's important.

Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se sa hlalosego ka nepo pitšo ya mantšu a se-Italian?,"The correct answer is **B: Mantšu a mantši a bitšwa ka tsela yeo a ngwadiwago ka gona (Many words are pronounced the way they are spelled).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Pitšo ya mantšu e tloga e le bonolo ka se-Italian ka ge mantšu a mantši a bitšwa ka tsela yeo a ngwadiwago ka gona."" This translates to ""The spelling of Italian words is not simple because many words are pronounced the way they are spelled.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Di r tše pedi di bitšwa go fapana le r ye tee (The two 'r's are pronounced differently):** While true, this is just one example of the complexity mentioned in the text. The main point is that many words are not straightforwardly pronounced based on spelling.
* **C: Mantšu a go ba le maletere c le g a ka gakantšhanyana (Words with the letters c and g can be tricky):** Again, true but a specific example. The core issue is the general difficulty in pronunciation based on spelling.
* **D: Pitšo ya mantšu a mantši e a fapana go ya ka ditumanoši tša go latela (The spelling of many words varies according to following rules):** The text doesn't emphasize that there *are* following rules. It highlights the inconsistency *despite* the rules.

Therefore, option B best encapsulates the main point of the text concerning the complexity of Italian word pronunciation based on spelling.



"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo tše di hlalosago dika tša toropo ya Izmir tšeo di bilego gona pele ga sebjalebjale?,"The correct answer is **B: Meago ya dikgalase ka pele (Ancient planning)**.

The text explicitly states: ""E be e le toropo ya kgale ya Smyrna...gape le lefelo leo le phetheselago la kgwebo, leo le rareditšwego ke dithaba. **Meago ya dikgalase ka pele** le disentara tša mabenkele a sebjalebjale di adilwe ka dihlaka tša di taelese tša setlo tše hwibedu...""

While the other options are features of modern Izmir, the question asks about features *before* it became a major trade center. The ancient planning and layout of the city were fundamental to its development and commercial success.
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se sa hlalosego ka nepo toropo ya Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Maemo a moo a bontšha Turkey ya bogologolo** (Its location shows the vastness of Turkey).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, *after* Istanbul. It also describes it as a major hub for trade and the westernmost region of Turkey. This information directly supports the idea that Izmir's location highlights the size and geographical spread of Turkey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Toropo ye e rareditšwe lebopo le legolo** (Its city was built on a large area): While the text mentions being built on hills, it doesn't highlight the *size* of the city's built-up area as a key characteristic.
*   **C: O ka hwetša bobedi mabenkele a sebjalebjale le dikereke tša kgale** (You can find both modern shops and ancient churches): This is a true statement based on the provided text and isn't something *not* explained.
*   **D: Toropo e na le boemakepe bja maemo a bobedi ka bogolo go la Turkey** (The city has the second-largest population in Turkey): The text says Izmir is the *third* largest city in Turkey.

"
Lentšu hanami le bolela ka go bogela eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Go khukhuša ga mohlare wa di plum**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kwešišo ye e tšwa China moo matšobana a matšidi a be a le malomo a kgetho. Go la Japane, mekete ya go khukuša ga mathomo ga dicherry e be e tswarwa ke mmuši a bakeng sa gagwe le maloko a mangwe a bogoši ka Lepatlelong la Bogoši."" This translates to: ""The custom originated in China where flowering plum blossoms were chosen. In Japan, the early cherry blossom season was initially celebrated by the emperor and other noble families in the Imperial Palace.""

The question asks what ""hanami"" means. The passage directly connects ""hanami"" to the celebration of flowering plum blossoms in China.  While the context then shifts to cherry blossoms in Japan, the *origin* of the custom, as described in the passage, is linked to plum blossoms.  Therefore, ""go khukhuša ga mohlare wa di plum"" (the viewing of plum blossoms) is the most accurate answer.



"
Ke mang a swerego meletlo ya mathomo ya go bogela mehlare ya ditšheri e khukhuša?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmuši ya China**.

The text states: ""Kwešišo ye e tšwa China moo matšobana a matšidi a be a le malomo a kgetho."" This translates to ""The custom originated from China, where plum blossoms were chosen for their lips-like shape.""  The text then goes on to describe how the tradition evolved in Japan. Therefore, the initial practice originated in China.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke karolo efe go tše di latelago ya Jerusalem yeo go ka diregago gore e se gogele baeti?","The correct answer is **D: Mafelo a mantši a histori**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Jerusalema e na le mafelo a mantši a histori, gammogo le mafelo a kgahliša a go tlala a go reka, dikhefi, le mabenkele a go jela.""  (Jerusalem has many historical sites, as well as attractive places to shop, cafes, and restaurants.)

While the other options are true about Jerusalem, the text emphasizes the *historical sites* as a key draw for visitors. The prominence of religious significance (B) and being the capital of Israel (C) are important, but the text highlights the historical sites as a specific reason for tourism. Religious sites (C) are mentioned, but not emphasized as much as the historical ones.
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se sa bolelwago karolong ye e le seo Jerusalem e tsebegago ka sona?,"The correct answer is **C: Bohlokwa bja sedumedi (Religious Significance)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Motse ke o mokgethwa go ditumelo tše tharo tša go ikema ka noši - Judaism, Christianity le Islam..."".  It also emphasizes Jerusalem's importance as a holy city for these faiths and as a major pilgrimage site. While the other options are true aspects of Jerusalem, the passage *primarily* highlights its religious significance as the key to its fame.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mohuta ofe wa moeti yo a ka se holwego ke go reka Wild Card?","The correct answer is **A: Moeti wa go nyaka go etela Diphaka tša Naga tše dintši ka mokgwa wo a kgonago.**

Here's why:

The text states that a Wild Card allows entry to *any* of the South African National Parks (SANParks) or to *any* park within the South African National Parks group.  This implies it's for someone who wants to visit multiple parks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moeti wa go etela phaka ya diphoofolo ya Kruger National Park feela:** While you *can* use a Wild Card to enter Kruger, the card is more valuable if you plan to visit other parks.
* **C: Moeti wa go boloka tšhelete e itšego wa go tshwenyega ka ditefišo tša phakeng:** While Wild Cards can help save money on park entrance fees, the primary motivation for buying one isn't just financial.
* **D: Moeti wa go nyaka go etela lešoka la diphoofolo la Kruger National Park le bonnyane phaka e nngwe e tee:**  A Wild Card is better suited for visiting *multiple* parks, not just Kruger and one other.
"
Ke lefoko lefe leo le sa hlalosego ka nepo Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Ke lešoka le lenyenyane kudu ge le bapetšwa le mašoka ka moka a Diphaka tša Setšhaba tša Afrika Borwa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Phaka e akaretša 19,500 km²...Ke ye nngwe ya dikgogedikgolo tša Afrika Borwa..."" (The park covers 19,500 km²...It is one of the largest in South Africa...).
* **Option C contradicts this directly.** It says the park is ""lenyenyane kudu"" (very small).

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: E tšewa bjalo ka lefelo la mathomo la go gogela baeti South Africa:** While Kruger is a popular destination, the passage doesn't explicitly state it's the *first* place visitors go in South Africa.  It's a major attraction, but not definitively the first stop.
* **B: Diphoofolo le dilo tše dingwe tša tlhago di a fapana go ya ka mafelo a ka gare ga phaka ye:** The passage directly mentions this: ""...Diphoofolo le dilo tše dingwe tša tlhago di a fapana go ya ka mafelo a ka gare ga phaka ye"" (Animals and other wildlife vary depending on the areas inside the park).
* **D: Baeng ba kgona go e tsena go lona ge feela ba rekile Wild Card:** The passage explicitly states this: ""Baeng ba kgona go e tsena go lona ge feela ba rekile Wild Card"" (People can enter it only if they have bought a Wild Card).



Therefore, option C is the only one that presents information contrary to what is stated in the passage.
"
Ke sefe sa dilo tšeo di latelago seo se nago le kgonagalo e kgolo ya go bea kotsing banamedi ba dithaba metheogeng ka moka ya thaba?,"The correct answer is **B: Go nyoga maswikeng (Climbing the stairs)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Seo seboletšwego, letela go felelea ke moya, gomme o hlokomele dikarolong tša go nyogela, kudu ge go tapile, ka ge go ka tloga gwa bakotsi."" This translates to: ""However, be prepared for the altitude, and pay attention to the climbing sections, especially when you are tired, as it can be dangerous.""

The text highlights that climbing the stairs (nyoga maswikeng) is a dangerous part of the ascent due to the altitude and potential fatigue. The other options are mentioned as factors to consider but not presented as the *primary* danger.
"
Ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago leo le sa hlalosego ka nepo morotoga wa thaba ya Machu Picchu bjalo ka ge go hlalositšwe karolong ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Ga go na dilo tša go itshwarelela ka mathoko dikarolong ka moka tša morotoga.**

Here's why:

* The passage describes the difficulty of the climb, mentioning needing to be fit, and the steepness of the sections.
* It also warns about the need to be careful and the potential for danger when ascending.
* Option B directly addresses a lack of handholds in the steeper sections, which aligns perfectly with the difficulty described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Batho ba go tloga ba le maemong a mmele a mabotse ba tla felelwa ke moya:** While the passage mentions needing to be fit and the importance of breathing, this isn't the *most* unexplained detail. The lack of handholds is a more direct obstacle to the climb.
* **C: O swanetše go feta ka leweng kua godimo:**  The passage mentions a small ledge, but it doesn't make this the *most* unexplained aspect of the climb's difficulty.
* **D: Metheoga e ba kotsi ge go thapile:** The passage mentions being careful when ascending and the potential danger of falling.  This isn't an unexplained detail, as it's a common risk in any steep climb.



Therefore, the lack of handholds in the steeper parts of the climb is the most unexplained detail, making option B the correct answer.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sefe sa dilo tše seo e sego karolo ya bohlokwahlokwa ya dijo tša Majorcan?","The correct answer is **C: Mabele**.

The text explicitly mentions that the Majorcan diet includes:

*   **Borotho** (vegetables)
*   **Nama** (meat, specifically kudu)
*   **Makhura a olive** (olive oil)

It also lists ingredients often used in the ""Pa amb Oli"" (bread with tomato and olive oil) such as tomatoes, garlic, etc.

**Mabele** (fish) is not mentioned as a regular or significant part of the Majorcan diet in this text. Therefore, it's the correct answer.
"
"Go ya ka tshedimošo ya karolong ye, ke lefoko lefe leo le sa bolelego nnete ka dijo tša hangi?","The correct answer is **A: Sekoti sa go fiša mo fase sa hangi se šomiša maswika a go fiša go tšwa mollong go ruthetša sekoti**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Molete o ka ba o thuteditšwe ka maswika a go fiša go tšwa mollong, goba ka di nako tše dingwe phišo ya geothermal e dira mafelo a fase gore a fiše ka hlago."" This means geysers can heat water *without* using a separate ""sekoti sa go fiša"" (cooking pot).
* **Option A claims:** The cooking pot uses a separate pot to heat the food. This is not directly supported by the passage. The passage only mentions that water is heated by geysers *or* steam from the ground.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sekoti sa go fiša mo fase sa hangi sa go šomiša maswika a go fiša se gona kua Wellington:** The passage says hangi can be seen in Wellington, but it doesn't specifically state that a cooking pot *using a separate pot* is found there.
* **C: Dijo tša go apewa sekoting sa go fiša gantši di apewa go šomišwa hangi:** The passage says food is cooked in the hangi, but it doesn't state that it is *always* cooked in a cooking pot.
* **D: Sekoti sa go fiša sa hangi se ka hwetšwa go la Rotorua:** The passage mentions hangi in Rotorua, but it doesn't say cooking pots are found there.

Therefore, **Option A** is the only statement that is not directly supported by the passage.
"
Ke mokgwa ofe go yeo e latelago o sa bolelwego e le tsela e tlwaelegilego ya go ruthetša sekoti sa hangi?,"The correct answer is **C: Phišo ya ka sekoting**.

The text states: ""Molete o ka ba o thuteditšwe ka maswika a go fiša go tšwa mollong, goba ka di nako tše dingwe phišo ya geothermal e dira mafelo a fase gore a fiše ka hlago."" This translates to: ""The cook can be heated with heat from the ground, or at other times geothermal vents create hot springs to cook it properly.""

Therefore, **phišo ya ka sekoting** (heat from the ground/geothermal vents) is an alternative, and less common, method of cooking hangi besides using heated rocks.
"
Ke selo sefe se re ka bonago ka gona gore motho ke monk goba nun?,"The correct answer is **A: Go apara seaparo sa go itata sa go taga (Wearing religious robes of habit)**.

The passage explicitly states that monks and nuns are identified by wearing religious robes. While the passage mentions other clothing items (like belts and head coverings), it emphasizes the robes as the primary identifier. The other options are not mentioned as identifying characteristics.
"
Ke diaparo dife go tše di latelago tšeo di ka no sebego go na go ka adingwa tempeleng ya di monk? ,"The correct answer is **C: Marokgo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Se le sona se ka adingwa go tšwa setokong mojako efela dikobo ga di hlatswe ka morago ga mošomiši o mongwe le o mongwe gore o ikwele o lokologile go apara dikete tše. **Marokgo** le lekana bohle bakeng sa banna!"" 

This translates to: ""The same can be found in the monastery's cupboard, after being checked by a servant to ensure it fits comfortably to wear those **bracelets**! Bracelets are suitable for all men!""

Therefore, bracelets (marokgo) are mentioned as an item of clothing suitable for men in the monastery. The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
Ke neng mo moeti a ka bago le menyetla e mentši ya go bona dinaledi ge a etetše mafelo a Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikgweding tša marega (Winter months)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ge mafelo a agilwe makatana..."" which translates to ""When the days are short...""  This directly refers to the winter months in the Southern Hemisphere (Antarctica).  Aurora Australis (the Southern Lights) are best viewed during the winter months due to the long hours of darkness.
"
Ke neng mo founo ya sathalaete e ka se kgonego go emela legato sellathekeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ge e ba thapo ya go bonagala ya sathalaete e ka šitišwa** (If the satellite's signal cable is disconnected).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mogala wa satalaete ga e tloge oe ba legatong la mogala wa go sepela le wona, ka ge o swanetše go ba ka ntle ka laene ya go hlweka ya satalaete go letša ka wona."" This translates to: ""A satellite receiver does not need to be in the range of a terrestrial television signal, but it needs to be outside the clear line of sight of the satellite to receive it.""

Therefore, if the cable connecting the satellite receiver to the satellite is disconnected, it wouldn't be able to receive the signal, even if it's outside the line of sight.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ge e ba lefelo le le kgole kudu le toropo** (If it's a very dense and urban area): Urban areas can sometimes have signal obstructions, but it's not the primary reason a satellite receiver might fail. The signal *needs* a clear line of sight, regardless of urban density.
* **C: Ge e ba mogala o tlo šomišwa ka ntle** (If the receiver is moved outdoors): Moving the receiver outdoors *could* help, but the issue is not the location itself, but rather whether the signal can reach it.
* **D: Ge e ba leeto le nyaka mohuta o itšego wa inthanete** (If the trip requires a self-contained internet type): This is irrelevant to satellite TV. Satellite TV doesn't rely on internet.



"
Ke neng mo mogala wa sathalaete o ka nyakegago kudu go phala sellathekeng?,"The correct answer is **B: Nakong ya leeto la sekepe**.

Here's why:

The text states that satellite internet can be a good option when there isn't a reliable wired internet connection.  A cruise ship is a perfect example of a situation where wired internet is often unavailable or unreliable.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ge o le maikhutšong motse-setoropong:**  This is unlikely. Cities generally have good wired internet infrastructure.
* **C: Ge inthanete ya mafelong a lekatana e sa hlokagale:** The text implies that satellite internet is *needed* when wired internet isn't available.
* **D: Ge go na le kgonagalo e kgolo ya gore o be le neteweke e lekanego ya sellathekeng:** This is contradictory. The point of satellite internet is to have a network *when* wired isn't available.



"
Ke ntwa ya go lwela eng yeo e bakilego gore go be le rephapoliki ya Transnistria?,"The correct answer is **B: Semorafe**.

The text states: ""Ka 1994, kgohlagano ye e išitše go hlolo ya repaboliki ya Transnistria ya maitirelo go la bodikela bja Moldova, **yeo e nago le mmušo wa yona le tšhelete ya wona efela ga e elwehloko ke maloko a dinaga tša UN.**""

This implies that the conflict leading to the creation of Transnistria was rooted in ethnic tensions.  While economic and political factors may have contributed, the text directly links the independence of Transnistria to an ethnic conflict.  The other options are not directly supported by the text as the *cause* of the conflict.
"
Ke eng sa dilo tše di latelago seo Mmušo wa Transnistria o nago le sona seo se fapanego le naga ka moka ya Moldova?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Tšhelete ya wona**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ka 1994, kgohlagano ye e išitše go hlolo ya repaboliki ya Transnistria ya maitirelo go la bodikela bja Moldova, yeo e nago le mmušo wa yona le tšhelete ya wona efela ga e elwehloko ke maloko a dinaga tša UN."" 

This means Transnistria has its own currency, separate from Moldova. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Leleme:** The text says the official language of Moldova is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.  Transnistria's language situation isn't mentioned in relation to Moldova's.
* **B: Sedumedi:** The text indicates economic disparities *within* Moldova, but doesn't specify a difference in the overall economy compared to Transnistria.
* **C: Go elwehloko ke maloko a dinaga tša UN:**  Both Moldova and Transnistria's finances are largely controlled by UN agencies. This isn't a differentiating factor.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke neng mo mosepedi a swanetšego go etela Montevideo ge e ba a nyaka go phema moya wa moo?","The correct answer is **A: Dikgweding tša marega ka Northern Hemisphere**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka ge ge Montevideo e le Karogantšho ya Lefase ya borwa, ke selemo moo ge e le marega go la Northern Hemispher..."" This directly indicates that the best time to visit Montevideo for pleasant weather is during the **winter months in the Northern Hemisphere**.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke neng mo mosepedi a swanetšego go etela Montevideo ge e ba a se na bothata le maemo a leratadima a magareng?","The correct answer is **A: Ge e le selemo go la Montevideo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka ge Montevideo e le Karogantšho ya Lefase ya borwa, ke selemo moo ge e le marega go la Northern Hemispher le go boela morago le pele bjale le bjale."" This means it's a good time to visit Montevideo *during the year*. The other options are too specific or incorrect.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se tla tswalanywago le grafitti, go fapana le motho wa go senya dithoto ka boomo?","The correct answer is **C: Mengwalo ya go se tloge meagong ya setšhaba.**

Here's why:

The passage states that while graffiti can be seen as vandalism, it also has a ""culture"" and ""rules."" One of those ""rules"" is that graffiti is often done in places *not* considered public property. This differentiates it from vandalism done on private property.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Meletlo ya dithalwa (The culture of graffiti):** While the passage mentions a culture, it doesn't specifically say this is *different* from vandalism.
*   **B: Mengwalo ya bohlaswa (Obscene writing):** The passage doesn't focus on whether graffiti is obscene or not.
*   **D: Mengwalo ya go se balege mabotong (Writing that doesn't break laws):** The passage states that graffiti is often done in places where it is illegal, so the fact that it doesn't break laws is not necessarily a differentiator.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is that graffiti is differentiated from vandalism by being written in places *not* belonging to the public.



"
Ke karolo efe ya mekete efe ya mmino yeo batho ba bangwe bao e tšeyago bjalo ka karolo ye bohlokwa ya maitemogelo?,"The correct answer is **B: Go kampa lefelong leo (To camp in that place)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bakeng sa mekete ye mengwe, bontši bja bao ba tlago go mekete ya mmino ba kgetha go kampa lefelong..."" which translates to ""For other festivals, many who attend music festivals choose to camp in the area...""  The passage then goes on to say this is a significant part of the experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tla le bana ba bannyane (To come with young children):** While some people might do this, the passage doesn't highlight it as a defining characteristic of festival-goers.
*   **C: Mmino wa go letšwa go fihlela bošego (Music that plays until dawn):**  This describes a type of music, not a behavioral characteristic of attendees.
*   **D: Go tsena ka pela (To enter ahead):** This refers to entering the festival grounds, not a way people choose to participate.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, motho wa go ya moteng ya mmino o swanetše go etiša eng pele ge e ba a nyaka go kampa kgauswi le mmino?","The correct answer is **D: Go tsena ka pela**.

The passage states: ""Ge e ba o tlo nyaka go ba kgauswi le tiragalo o tlo tswanela ke go tsena ka pela go hwetša lefelo la go kampa kgauswi le mmino."" (If you want to be in front, you will have to go in to find a place to be in front of the music). This means you need to enter to find a spot to stand near the music.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mafelo afe ao baeti ba swanetšego go a phema ge ba nyaka go ipshina bošego ka leboa la Mexico o Moswa?","The correct answer is **A: Pueblos**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mafelo a Pueblos a bego kgole ka gona, o ka se kgone go hwetša bophelo bja bošego bjo bontši ntle le go ya Albuquerque goba Santa Fe.""  (Referring to the area described, the ancient Pueblos are where you can find a lot of healthy life without going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.)
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke kae mo moeti a ka hwetšago mafelo a go tuma a boithabišo ka leboa la Mexico o Moswa?","The correct answer is **B: Lefelong la pueblo la ka ntle ga toropo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go nyakile eke dikhasino ka moka tšeo di ngwadilwego mo lenaneong la ka godimo di rekiša dino, gomme tše dingwe tša tšona bja tšona bo tliša boithabišo bja maina-ina (gagolo tše kgolo tšeo di potapotilego Albuquerque le Santa Fe)"". This implies that casinos *in* Albuquerque and Santa Fe don't offer the same type of entertainment.  Then the passage goes on to say: ""Dipara tša ditorotswana tše nnyane ga e dule e le mafelo a mabotse bakeng sa baeti ba go tšwa ka ntle gore ba ka dula.""  And finally: ""Leboa la Mexico o Moswa le na mathata a mantši a go reilwa go tagilwe, gomme maemo a go tagwa a baaotledi a godimo kgauswi le dibara tša diporopo tše dinnyane.""  This strongly suggests that casinos in smaller towns (like those around pueblos) are where visitors can find entertainment.

Option B directly reflects this. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Khasinong ya monabo wa diiri tše pedi go tloga Albuquerque** - The passage explicitly says casinos in Albuquerque don't offer the same entertainment.
*   **C: Khasinong ya kgauswi le Sante Fe** - Again, the passage says casinos in Santa Fe don't offer the same entertainment.
*   **D: Lefelong la go nwela bjala la torotswaneng** - This is irrelevant to the passage's content.



"
Baeti ba go seketša tšhelete ba swanetše go phema dino dife?,"The correct answer is **A: Beine ya Australia**.

The text states: ""Bere yengwe ya selegae e bitšwa """"""Manta"""""""". Gona le dibeine tše dintši tša French tša go nwewa, efela dibeine tša New Zealand le Australia di ka feta bokaone."" This translates to: ""Another specialty drink is called ""Manta"". There are many French drinks to drink, but New Zealand and Australian drinks can surpass them in popularity.""

Therefore, the guests should try Australian coffee.
"
"Go ya ka lefelo leo le hlalositšwego karolong ye, ke seno sefe seo motšheladino a ka se fapantšhago le dino tše dingwe?","The correct answer is **A: Short black**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""For Australians, the coffee tradition of 'long black' is the most popular. This meets an espresso, topped with cream (not froth), and served without a cap. Hot chocolate is in the Belgian style. Soft drinks are only fizzy.""

This directly identifies the ""short black"" (often referred to as ""long black"" in Australia) as a distinguishing coffee drink.  The other options are not specifically identified as unique to the region in the text:

*   **B: Ke Number One** - This refers to a specific type of beer, not a coffee drink.
*   **C: Sauvignon Blanc ya go tšwa New Zealand** - While New Zealand wines are mentioned, Sauvignon Blanc isn't highlighted as unique.
*   **D: Kofi ya go 'ikala ye šweu'** - This is espresso, which is a base for many coffee drinks, not a unique Australian offering on its own.
"
Mokgwa wo o tšerego mengwaga e makgolo a mararo o le gona wa colonization o thomilwe ke bomang?,"The correct answer is **D: Maspaniard**.

The text states: ""Paraguay e belegwe bjalo ka ditlamorago tša go kopana ga bafenyi ba Spanish le dihlopa tša badudi ba setšo."" This translates to ""Paraguay was founded as a result of the meeting of Spanish settlers and indigenous groups.""  The text then says the Spanish colonization lasted for three centuries.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke tsela efe e kaonekaone ya go dira gore motho wa Paris a go rate?","The correct answer is **A: Go leka go itshwara bjalo ka batho ba Paris**.

The passage explicitly states: ""tsela ye kaone ya go tlwaela Paris... ke go itshwara gabotse, o phele bjalo ka motho yo a """"""""bien élevé"""""""" (godišitšwego gabotse).""  This translates to ""the best way to get used to Paris... is to behave properly, to live like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-bred).""

The passage mentions etiquette (mekgwa) and refinement (lenyatšo) as aspects of this ""proper behavior."" While the other options might contribute to being liked, they are not the primary focus of the passage regarding how to *fit in* with Parisian society.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke dilo dife go tše di latelago tšeo di sa lebelelwego e le mokgwa wa batho ba Paris?","The correct answer is **C: Go raloka kudu (Being too loud)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that to assimilate into Parisian life, one needs ""mekgwa le goba le lenyatšo"" (etiquette and elegance) and to ""itshwara gabotse, o phele bjalo ka motho yo a 'bien élevé'"" (be well-mannered, live like someone who is well-bred). This implies a certain level of reservedness and quietness is expected.

Therefore, ""go raloka kudu"" (being too loud) is the opposite of the desired behavior and is therefore not considered a way to fit in with Parisians.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ba le kgang (Being polite):**  The passage explicitly mentions ""mekgwa"" (etiquette), which includes politeness.
*   **B: Lenyatšo (Elegance):** The passage explicitly mentions ""lenyatšo"" (elegance) as a requirement.
*   **D: Go hloka mekgwa (Lack of etiquette):** The passage explicitly states that ""go hloka mekgwa"" is not the way to successfully integrate.

"
Mohola wa go namela go Maemo a Pele go MetroRail ke ofe?,"The correct answer is **C: Thekete ya gona ga e bitše kudu go swana le ya Maemo a Boraro (The ticket price is largely the same as that of Metro).**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""MetroPlus e iketlile kudu gape ga ya tlala efela e tura kudu gannyane, le ge e sa lefelega go feta dithekete tša metro ka Europe."" This means MetroPlus largely follows the same ticketing system as the regular Metro.  The phrase ""e sa lefelega go feta dithekete tša metro ka Europe"" indicates it's similar to the main metro system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Madulo a ka pele ka setimeleng (The first cars in the train):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the cars being at the front.
* **B: Ga go tlale ka batho (It doesn't carry many people):** The passage states it's largely the same as the main Metro, implying it carries a significant number of people.
* **D: Theko ya thekete e no lekana le ya Ditimela ka moka (The ticket price is equal to that of the main train):** The passage says the ticket price is *largely the same*, not *equal*.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate based on the information given."
"Go ya ka karolo ye, setimela sefe goba sefe sa go tsamaiša batho Cape Town se na le eng?","The correct answer is **D: Madulo a bobedi Maemo a Pele le a Boraro**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""MetroRail e na le maemo a mabedi go banamedi ba ditereni ka gare le tikologong ya Cape Town: MetroPlus (e bitšwa gape Maemo a Pele) le Metro (e bitšwa Maemo a Boraro)."" This translates to ""MetroRail has two modes of trains in the rail system and technology of Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as First Choice) and Metro (also known as Second Choice).""

Therefore, the question asks what trains transport people in Cape Town, and the passage directly identifies those trains as MetroPlus and Metro.
"
Ke dilo dife go tše di latelago tšeo diji di ka se di dirego?,"The correct answer is **D: Go hlola dikgobalo tše šoro (Assessing dangerous animals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that dangerous animals can:

*   Spoil food
*   Test safety
*   Test equipment
*   Damage property
*   Cause illness
*   Attack and kill people

Option D, ""Go hlola dikgobalo tše šoro"" (Assessing dangerous animals), directly aligns with the dangers described in the passage. The passage is describing the risks posed by wild animals.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Go hlola dišo (Assessing children):** While children might be at risk from animals, the passage doesn't focus on children specifically.
*   **B: Dišo tša aletši (Eagle's eggs):**  The passage doesn't mention eagle eggs or any specific bird eggs.
*   **C: Go tshwaetša malwetši (Preventing diseases):** While illness is mentioned as a risk, the passage is about the dangers *posed by the animals themselves*, not about disease prevention."
Dikarata tša gore o kgone go letša di ka rekwa kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Ditišing tša ditimela (Travel agencies)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that cards for finding the cheapest fares are often found by comparing different options. Travel agencies are the most logical place to access these cards and compare flight/travel costs.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Dinageng tše itšego (Tourist offices):** While tourist offices provide travel information, they are less likely to directly sell cards for finding the *cheapest* fares.
*   **C: Mabenkeleng a magahlanong a ditsela (Transportation stations):** Transportation stations might have some travel information, but are not the primary place to purchase these cards.
*   **D: Megaleng ya go lefelelwa (Airports):** Airports are where you *use* the fares you find, not where you buy the cards to find them.



"
O ka hwetša bjang mehola e kaone ya go letša yeo e newago ke dikarata tše dingwe?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka go šomiša megala ya go lefelelwa le go lefa tefišo ya tlaleletšo.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""hwetšagala ga ditirelo tše gantši go ba ka mokgwa wa go letšetša nomoro ya mogala ya mahala yeo e ka letšetšwego go tšwa megaleng ye mentši ntle le tefelo."" This translates to ""finding many services can be a way to get a free phone number that can be obtained from many phones without a fee.""  This strongly implies using roaming and claiming a promotional offer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E ka hwetšwa feela dinageng tše itšego (It can only be found in certain countries):** The passage doesn't indicate this is a limitation.
* **B: Ka dinomoro tša go letša mahala (Through free calling numbers):**  The passage talks about *getting* a free phone number, not about calling with free numbers.
* **C: Mabenkeleng a magahlanong a ditsela (In roadside shops):** The passage doesn't mention roadside shops.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate based on the provided text.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mehlare efe go yeo e latelago e sa tlalago kudu phakeng ya bosetšhaba ya Matsheng a Plitvice?","The correct answer is **C: Mohlare wa Fir (Fir Forest)**.

The text states: ""Matsha a Plitvice a tloga e le lešhoka, kudu ka beech, spruce, **mehlare ya fir**, le go ba gona ga hlakantšo ya temo ya Alpine le Mediterranean.""  This indicates that fir forests are a significant part of the forest.
"
Ke diphoofolo dife go tše di latelago tšeo di sa tlalago kudu phakeng ya bosetšhaba ya Matsha a Plitvice?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The text explicitly states that Capercaillie are found in the Plitvice Lakes National Park.  The Honey Badger is also mentioned. Turkey and Cassowary are not mentioned as being found there.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, dikhouto tša tikologo di thuša ka eng?","The correct answer is **B: Go laola mebaraka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Morero o mogolo ke go fa dikhampani tšeo taolo ya tlaleletšo godimo ga mebaraka ya bona; ke fela ka ga go dukuluša tšhelete."" (The main plan is to give companies control over the monitoring of their assets; it's just to increase profits.)

This clearly indicates that environmental watchdogs (dikhoutu tša tikologo) are intended to *monitor* (laola) assets (mebaraka).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go kopisa diski (To copy discs):** The text mentions ""go kopisa diski ga nnyane-ga-nnyane"" (copying discs little by little) in the context of data leakage, not what environmental watchdogs do.
* **C: Go šireletša sephiri (To protect the environment):** While environmental watchdogs *could* indirectly help protect the environment, the text's primary focus is on corporate profit and control of assets, not environmental protection itself.
* **D: Go kopisa mo go sego molaong (To copy illegally):** The text explicitly says that illegal copying is not permitted.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke taba efe go tše di latelago e lego maaka ao a phatlalatšwago ke dikhampani tša boraditaba mabapi le dikhouto tša tikologo?","The correct answer is **A: Di bohlokwa go hwetša taolo ya tlaleletšo godimo ga mebaraka.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Morero o mogolo ke go fa dikhampani tšeo taolo ya tlaleletšo godimo ga mebaraka ya bona; ke fela ka ga go dukuluša tšhelete.""  This translates to ""The main plan is to give companies control over monitoring their emissions; it's only to reduce costs.""

The passage emphasizes the importance of companies gaining monitoring control.  While reducing costs is mentioned, the core message related to what the news reports are about is establishing monitoring control.
"
"Ge o fihla nageng ya geno, ke mokgwa ofe wo ka tlwaelo o sa šalwego morago kudu?","The correct answer is **A: Go hlahloba batšwantle (Checking baggage)**.

Here's why:

The prompt mentions that customs checks can be difficult and emphasizes understanding what you can and cannot bring into the country. The most common and expected procedure upon arrival at a country is to have your baggage checked by customs officials.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Go fetiša dilo (Transferring luggage):** While important, this isn't the primary expected procedure related to customs.
* **C: Melao ya go lekanyetša palo ya dilo (Rules for counting items):**  Rules exist, but the immediate action is the physical check of the items.
* **D: Lefelo la go phuruphutša (Direction to go):**  This is simply guidance, not the expected procedure regarding customs.



Therefore, the standard and most expected action upon arrival at a country, especially given the context of customs difficulties, is baggage inspection.
"
Ke dilo dife go tše di latelago tše o swanetšego go di tseba pele o fihla nageng ya geno?,"The best answer is **B: Ge e ba o swanetše go fetiša dilo go ya ka palo ye e dumeletšwego ke molao.**

Here's why:

* **The initial statement emphasizes customs and regulations at the border.**  Being aware of what you *can* and *cannot* bring into the country is crucial to avoid issues with customs officials.
* **Option B directly addresses this by highlighting the importance of declared items and legal limits.**  Customs declarations are a key part of the process.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly relevant:

* **A: Ge e ba go na le lefelo la go hlahloba batšwantle:** While there might be inspection points, the core issue is what you *declare* and what's *allowed* to be brought in.
* **C: Ge e ba o tla ba le baphuruphutši:** Border officials are expected, but simply knowing they'll be there doesn't address the legal requirements around goods.
* **D: Ge e ba go na le dilo tše o tlago le tšona tše di sa dumelelwago:**  This is a *result* of not knowing the rules, not a preventative measure.

Therefore, understanding the legal limits and declaring items correctly (Option B) is the most fundamental thing to know before arriving in a country with strict customs.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke bontši bja eng bjo bo dumelelago banamedi ba dithaba go dula ba hwetša ditsela tše diswa Moeding wa Cochamó?","The correct answer is **D: Maboto**.

The text states: ""Banamedi go tšwa dikarolong tša lefase di tšwela pele go hlomamiša ditsela tše diswa magareng ga bokgoni bja go se fele bja maboto a bona."" which translates to ""Trout from all parts of the world continue to strive to conquer the waterfalls between the seemingly endless ability of their fins.""

This clearly indicates that **fins (maboto)** are what allow the trout to climb waterfalls in Cochamó Valley.
"
"Go ya ka seo se boletšwego karolong ye, ke bomang bao ba fetago ditsela tše dintši tša Karolong ya Borwa?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Eela Star Alliance e gokaretša tšohle ntle le Pacific ya bodikela bja Borwa go tšwa Santiago de Chile go ya Tahiti, yeo e lego sefofane sa LATAM Oneworld.""  This means Star Alliance includes a wider network than SkyTeam and encompasses the South Pacific routes that LATAM Oneworld covers.
"
Ke mokgatlo ofe wa difofane wo o fetago palo e nyenyane ya ditsela tša lewatle Karolong ya Borwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ke getho ya difofane leo le akaretšago ditshelaganyo tše tharo tša lewatle ka gare ga seripa sa lefelo la Borwa (gomme SkyTeam ga se akaretša le ye tee ya ditshelaganyo tše). **Efela, Star Alliance e gokaretša tšohle...**"" (Only Star Alliance includes everything...).
"
Ke mokgatlo ofe o kgonnego go phetha Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Ralala ga go Kitima**.

The passage states that Global Running Tours organizes trips between cities, and lists ""Go Ralala ga go Kitima ga Barcelona go Barcelona le go Kitima go Copenhagen ga Copenhagen"" (Trips from Lisbon to Barcelona and from Lisbon to Copenhagen) and ""Go Ralala ga go Kitima ga Prague go go lego Prague le go gongwe"" (Trips from Lisbon to Prague and elsewhere).  While the specific examples mentioned include Barcelona, Copenhagen and Prague, the question asks what *kind* of trip Global Running Tours offers, and the example ""Go Ralala ga go Kitima"" is a general example of a trip offered.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, Global Running Tours e thuša go kopantša mekgatlo e mekae ya go ralala ga go kitima?","The correct answer is **A: E mene (Four)**.

The text states: ""Global Running Tours e kopantša baabi ba sightrunning ba bantšintši go dikontinente tše nne."" which translates to ""Global Running Tours brings together many sightrunning tours to four continents.""  Therefore, they organize tours to four continents, meaning four regions.
"
Moeti o swanetše go dira’ng ge a nyaka go bona gabotse lepogo?,"The correct answer is **C: O swanetše go šomiša di binoculars.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tsepelo ya leeto la go tšea diswantšho (gape e bitšwa """"""""go sepela ka sethokgweng"""""""", """"""""go sepela leeto le letelele la go tšea diswantšho"""""""", goba go ya """"""""ka maoto"""""""") e dirilwe ka leeto le letelele, la diiri tše mmalwa goba matšatši a mmalwa."" and ""Ditau, mapogo le dinkwe di na le dihlong ka matšatši a mangwe gomme o tla di bona kaone ka di binoculars.""

This means binoculars are used to see animals like giraffes, antelopes, and birds, which are mentioned as having spots.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke diphoofolo dife tšeo moeng a ka di bonago ge a nametše koloi ya go bontšha baeti naga?","The correct answer is **A: Ditau**.

The text states: ""Ditau, mapogo le dinkwe di na le dihlong ka matšatši a mangwe..."".  This means you can see giraffes, elephants, and other animals sometimes.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se ka fokotšago ditshenyagalelo tša leeto?","The correct answer is **B: Go sepela le sehlopha sa batho ba bane**.

Here's why:

The passage warns against traveling with a large group, stating that it can attract unwanted attention and even lead to extortion.  The passage explicitly mentions that ""baeti ba šutišetšwa kua le kua go tlatša disafatanaga"" (tourists are harassed and extorted) when traveling in larger groups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ikela o le noši (Traveling alone):** While traveling alone might have its risks, the passage doesn't directly address the dangers of solo travel. It focuses on the dangers of groups.
* **C: Go ya le motho yo mongwe (Traveling with one other person):** The passage doesn't explicitly say that traveling with one other person is a problem.  The issue is with larger groups.
* **D: Go sepela le sehlopha sa batho ba tshela goba go fetiša (Traveling with a living group or a tour):**  This is the *opposite* of what the passage warns against. The passage cautions *against* large groups like tours.



Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that traveling with a large group (sehlopha sa batho ba bane) increases the risk of problems and negatively impacts the travel experience.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mang yo a ka hwetšago ditefelo tše kaone tša leeto?","The correct answer is **A: Baeti ba go ikemišetša go fetofetoša dikoloi (Volunteering travelers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tša boeti e ba tša tefelo ya fase bakeng sa dihlopa tše dikgolo, kafao ge eba o tee goba o no ba le mogwera o tee, leka go kopana le batho ba bangwe gomme le dire sehlopa sa batho ba bane go iša go tshela bakeng sa tefelo ya motho ka o tee ye kaone.""  This translates to: ""These are volunteer travel groups for large groups, whether you are a volunteer or have a guide, try to meet other people and form a group of four people to go live for the one-on-one experience of human travel.""

While the passage mentions groups of four, it focuses on *volunteers* doing this kind of travel.  Option A, ""Baeti ba go ikemišetša go fetofetoša dikoloi"" (Volunteering travelers), best reflects the spirit of the passage.  The passage implies that these volunteer travel groups are experiencing ""tefelo ya motho ka o tee ye kaone"" (the one-on-one experience of human travel).



The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sehlopha sa batho ba bararo (A group of three):** The passage mentions groups of four, not three.
* **C: Bagwera ba babedi ba go sepela mmogo (Two guides traveling together):** The passage mentions guides as possibilities but isn't focusing on just two guides. It focuses on volunteers.
* **D: Sehlopha sa batho ba bahlano (A group of five):**  The passage mentions groups of four, not five.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng sa go dira gore San Francisco e tsebege lefase ka bophara?","The best answer is **B: Mafelo a mabotse kudu a kopanelo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""San Francisco gape ke yengwe ya mafelo a makaone nageng bakeng sa dijo tše dingwe tša Asia: Korean, Thai, Indian, le Japanese.""  This directly supports option B.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Go tšwelela ga yona gantši ka gare ga mmino, difilimi, dingwalwa le ditšo tša go tuma go thušitše go dira motse le mafelo a wona a go tsebalega lefaseng ka bophara."" This highlights the importance of culture and arts in making San Francisco globally appealing.
* **While option A is partially true (culture contributes), option B is more specific and directly mentioned.** Option C (Economy of innovation) is mentioned but doesn't explicitly state why San Francisco is globally renowned.
* **Option D (Arrival of Asian foods) is true, but it's presented as *one* of the factors contributing to its global appeal, whereas the passage emphasizes the broader cultural and culinary scene.**



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and directly supported answer."
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe mabapi le San Francisco leo e sego nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Dijo tša Asia di atile kudu**.

The text explicitly states: ""San Francisco gape ke yengwe ya mafelo a makaone nageng bakeng sa dijo tše dingwe tša Asia: Korean, Thai, Indian, le Japanese."" This means a variety of Asian cuisines are prominent, not that they *dominate*.

Here's why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: E tšweletše gantši difiliming le ka dingwalweng:** ""Go tšwelela ga yona gantši ka gare ga mmino, difilimi, dingwalwa le ditšo tša go tuma go thušitse go dira motse le mafelo a wona a go tsebalega gore di tsebege lefaseng ka bophara.""
*   **C: Go na le dihotele tše dintši le mafelo a kopanelo:** ""San Francisco gape ke yengwe ya mafelo a makaone nageng bakeng sa dihotele tše mmalwa, mafelo a go jela, le mafelo a maemo a godimo a kopanelo.""
*   **D: Ekonomi e ithekgile feela ka tša boeti:** ""Metheo ya tša boeti ka dihotele tše mmalwa, mafelo a go jela, le mafelo a maemo a godimo a kopanelo."" (This implies a significant portion of the economy is tied to tourism.)



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mosepedi wa mohuta ofe yo a ka se holwego ke go šomiša khamphani ya ditirelo tša go tšea maeto?","The correct answer is **B: Mosepedi wa go dira dilo ka lepotlapotla (Detail-oriented person)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the importance of planning and organizing *before* the trip, including:

*   Informing guests of their lodging details.
*   Gathering information about dietary restrictions and travel arrangements.
*   Allowing time for planning and obtaining necessary documents like visas.

These are all tasks that require a detail-oriented approach – someone who likes to pay attention to the specifics and make sure everything is in order.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Mosepedi wa pelo-pedi (Person who is emotional):** While empathy is important in customer service, the text focuses on organizational skills rather than emotional sensitivity.
*   **C: Mosepedi yo a sego a hlwa a hwetša visa ya gagwe (Person who doesn't bother to get their visa):** The text highlights the necessity of obtaining visas *before* the trip, directly contradicting this option.
*   **D: Mosepedi wa go rata go beeletša dilo tše mmalwa (Person who likes to include a lot of things):** While a good customer service provider may offer multiple options, the text stresses the need for thorough planning and organization of details, not just bundling many things together.



"
Ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se sa bolelwago karolong ye e le seo se ka holago mosepedi yo a beeletšago a šomiša khamphani ya ditirelo tša maeto?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditokomane tša maeto tša go lokišwa kapejana (Travel documents to be arranged in advance)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is missing from the paragraph about advising travelers *before* they arrive at their hotel. The paragraph emphasizes pre-trip preparations like visa requirements, travel insurance, and packing lists.  Therefore, travel documents needing to be arranged beforehand (passports, visas, etc.) are a crucial element that is missing from the hotel's pre-arrival communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mehola ya ditirelo tša hotele (Hotel service brochures):** While helpful, brochures about hotel services are secondary to the essential pre-trip documents.
* **C: Ditefelo tše di feletšego tša leeto (Complete travel itineraries):**  Itineraries are helpful, but not as fundamentally important as ensuring the traveler *has* the necessary documents to travel.
* **D: Go dula o swere bohlatse bja peeletšo (Always be prepared for emergencies):**  Emergency preparedness is important, but the question focuses on what to do *before* arrival, not *during* a potential emergency.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke dilo dife tšeo mananeo a go fetolela kapejana a sa kgonego go di dira?","The correct answer is **B: Go fetolela dikarolo ka moka tša mafoko (To translate entire phrases)**.

The text states: ""Di dirišwa tša go fetolela sengwala - di dirišwa tšeo di nago le bokgoni bja go fetolela mafoko ka moka a sengwalwa go tšwa lelemeng le tee go ya go le lengwe.""  This directly translates to: ""Translation tools - are tools that have the ability to translate entire written words from one language to another.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go fetolela maswao ka maleme a šele (To translate words into different languages)** - While the text mentions translating into other languages, it focuses on the ability to translate *entire phrases*, not just individual words.
* **C: Go fetolela mongwalo go dilo o šomiša difouno tša sebjalebjale (To translate a text into things using smartphones)** - This is a broad statement and not specifically what the text highlights as a new capability.  The text focuses on the *how* of the translation, not *what* it can translate *into*.
* **D: Go fetolela tlwaa ka nepo ka dinako ka moka (To translate slang accurately in real-time)** - While real-time translation is mentioned as a feature of some apps like Google Translate, the text doesn't emphasize accuracy of slang as a *new* ability of translation tools in general.



"
Ke eng sa go dira gore go fetolela ntle le inthanete go kgonege?,"The correct answer is **C: Go taonelouta boitsebišo bja leleme (Pre-downloading language data)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ye tee ya di app tše bohlokwa kudu ke lebakeng le ke Google Translate, yeo e dumelelago **phetolelo ya offline morago ga go download data ya leleme leo o le nyakago**.""  This means the ability to translate without internet relies on downloading the language data *beforehand*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Metšhene ya go fetolela yeo e kaonafaditšwego (Established translation software):**  While established software is involved, it's the *pre-downloaded data* that makes offline translation possible.
* **B: Difouno tša sebjalebjale (Smartphones):** Smartphones are the devices, but they don't inherently provide the translation capability; it's the data and software loaded onto them.
* **D: Mananeo a legoro la go fetolela ka pejana (Previously installed translation programs):**  Similar to A, pre-installed programs aren't the key; it's the *data* they are loaded with that enables offline functionality.



"
Ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se sa bakego go kgokologa ga lehlwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Go ga lehlwa le lengwe (The other falling of the object)**.

Here's why:

The text states the problem is that the falling object is *uneven* and needs to be calibrated. It also says that the issue arises from **another object falling** and potentially being misaligned. The other options are related to the *cause* of the falling, not the *reason* why the falling object isn't causing the shaking/vibration (the shaking is the problem). 

*   **A: Lehlwa la go tanya (The falling of the question):** This doesn't make sense in the context.
*   **B: Batho (People):**  While people *might* be involved in the situation, the text focuses on the mechanical issue of the falling object.
*   **C: Mahlasedi a letšatši (Daylight):** Daylight isn't mentioned as a factor in the problem.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is the falling of another object.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se kgokologelago fase?","The correct answer is **A: Lehlwa la go tanya ga le bake seo** (The leaking part that causes that).

The passage states: ""Bothata ke gore lehlwa le a kgomarela, ka fao le hloka sekgorometše gore se tle..."" which translates to ""The problem is that the leak is stubborn, as it requires a specific reason to occur..."" This implies the leaking *part* is what's causing the problem and potentially the dripping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Metheoga yeo e se nago lehlwa** (Things that don't have a leak): The passage focuses on a leak, not things without one.
* **C: Lehlwa la go se nyakege metheogeng** (A leak that doesn't need a reason): While the passage mentions the leak requires a reason, it doesn't say it *doesn't* cause dripping.  The dripping is a *result* of the leak.
* **D: Lehlwa leo batho ba sa tshwenyanego le lona** (A leak that people don't sympathize with): This is irrelevant to the physical problem described in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, khari e dirilwe ka metswako efe?","The correct answer is **C: Maswi a khokhonate le nama**.

The text states: ""Go ya ka karolo ye, yokate e tlwaelegile go šomišwa ka gare ga dikhari; go la Borwa bja India le dileteng tše dingwe tša lebopo la kontinente ya ka tlasana, maswi a khokhonate a tlwaelegile go šomišwa."" This translates to: ""According to the passage, fish are commonly transported in carts; in Northern India and other parts of the continent, dried fish are commonly transported.""  The passage doesn't mention carts, but it specifically mentions **dried fish (maswi a khokhonate)** being transported. It also refers to other food items being transported. While ""nama"" (meat) is mentioned in the opening sentence as something that can be preserved through drying, the question specifically asks about what the cart is made of, and the text focuses on *what* is transported (dried fish). Since there's no information about the materials of the cart in the provided text, and only dried fish is specifically mentioned as being transported, C is the most reasonable answer.
"
"Dileteng tše dingwe, ka dinako tše dingwe maswi a khokhonate a šomišwa legatong la motswako ofe wa khari?","The correct answer is **A: Nama**.

The text states: ""Dileteng tše dingwe, ka dinako tše dingwe maswi a khokhonate a tlwaelegile go šomišwa **legatong la motswako ofe wa khari? Nama**."" (In other places, at other times, beef is commonly transported in the refrigerator.)
"
Ke ka baka la eng go fetola tsela ka lebelo Dithabeng tša Transantarctic go nyakega gore o tsene nageng ya molala?,"The correct answer is **B: Lehlwa la go kgobelana le kotsi (Hazardous terrain)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the South Pole Traverse is difficult, especially when crossing the Transantarctic Mountains. It specifically mentions needing to navigate around the mountains to reach the Pole.
* The question asks what would cause a change in route through the Transantarctic Mountains requiring a detour.
* **Hazardous terrain** directly addresses the reason for a change in route.  Difficult terrain (mountains, etc.) necessitates detours to ensure safe passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gantši seteišene sa McMurdo se phela se tswaletšwe (Many McMurdo stations have been established):** The location of McMurdo stations is irrelevant to route changes through the Transantarctic Mountains.
* **C: Diterekere tša moo ga di na lebelo (Tractors in the area):**  The presence of tractors doesn't explain *why* a detour would be needed.
* **D: Go bonolo go e na le go sepela ka Ross Sea (It's easy to travel in the Ross Sea):** The passage indicates that travel in the Ross Sea is *not* easy, and the question focuses on the Transantarctic Mountains.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and accurate response.



"
"Go bapa Tsela ya South Pole, ke’ng seo se swailwego ka difolaga?","The correct answer is **C: Mawa ao a apešitšwego ka lehlwa (Frozen waves)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is *swallowed* by the waves on the South Pole Traverse. The passage explicitly states: ""E lehlwa la go tlalelana le maope a go tlala ka le go marakiwa ka difolaga"" which translates to ""It is a traverse of being swallowed by waves and being ravaged by snow."" This indicates the waves themselves are swallowing the traverse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tsejana ya Seteišeneng sa McMurdo (McMurdo Station traverse):** While the traverse *starts* at McMurdo, the waves aren't swallowing the *station*.
*   **B: Diterekere tša go sepetša makhura (Snowmobile tracks):** Snowmobile tracks are something *made* on the traverse, not something swallowed by the waves.
*   **D: Ditsejana tše kotsi tša go aroga dithabeng (Dangerous landslides):** Landslides are a risk, but the passage specifically mentions waves as the swallowing force.



"
Ke eng seo se sa bolelwago karolo ye seo baeti ba swanetšego go se ela hloko ge ba etetše Southern Africa?,"The correct answer is **A: Dinaga tša go fapana di na le dinyakwa tša go fapana tša Visa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...Dinyakwa tša visa le ditshenyagalelo difapana go tšwa nageng go ya nageng go ya Southern Africa..."" (Visa requirements and regulations differ from country to country within Southern Africa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go sepela ka koloi ke tsela e botse ya go etela mafelo ao a sa tumago** (Traveling by car is the best way to visit remote places) - While the passage mentions 4x4 vehicles are helpful for remote areas, it doesn't definitively say it's *the best* way to visit remote places.
* **C: Mo e ka bago dinaga ka moka tša kgauswi le Southern Africa di tsepame** (When traveling to countries north of Southern Africa, be careful) - The passage doesn't mention traveling north of Southern Africa. It focuses solely on Southern Africa.
* **D: Go nyakega 4x4 ge e ba o sepela ka koloi** (You need a 4x4 if you travel by car) - The passage says 4x4 vehicles are *helpful* for remote areas, but not that they are *required* for all car travel in Southern Africa.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of information presented in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se ka lebelelwago e le maele a mabe go baeti bao ba nyakago go bona Southern Africa ka koloi?","The correct answer is **A: Go na le dilo tše dingwe tša ka koloing tša thušo ya tšhoganetšo tšeo di ka nyakegago ka molao.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while a 4x4 is highly recommended and opens up many more locations, Southern Africa isn't made up of only inaccessible countries.  However, it also emphasizes that different countries have different visa requirements and regulations. This implies travelers should be prepared for potential issues that might necessitate emergency assistance supplies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lege go kgothaletšwa 4x4, o ka kgona go fihla mafelong a mangwe ka koloi ya go tlwaelega:** The passage directly contradicts this, stating a 4x4 is *highly recommended* to access more places.
* **C: Go sepela ka koloi ke kgopolo e botse go bao ba nyakago go ya le mafelong a mangwe:** The passage highlights that while driving is a good option, it comes with logistical considerations like visa requirements and varying road conditions.  It doesn't frame it as universally ""the best"" option.
* **D: Ga se dinaga ka moka tša kgauswi le Southern Africa tšeo di loketšego go ka etelwa:** This isn't supported by the passage. The passage states that Southern Africa isn't *only* inaccessible countries and that it's a good travel destination.



"
Ke dilo dife go tše di latelago tšeo di sa bolelwago karolong ye e le kotsi ye e ka diregago ge o ka tlogela merwalo ya gago e sa hlokomelwa?,"The correct answer is **B: O ka ikhwetša o le mogweba ka diokobatši o sa tsebe (You can be exploited as a pawn by thieves without your knowledge).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""O ka ikhweša o šomišwa bjalo ka morwadi wa diokobatši ntle le tsebo ya gago, seo se ka go tsenya ka gare ga mathata a magolo kudu."" (You can be exploited like a pawn by thieves without your knowledge, which can lead to very serious problems.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E ka utswiwa (It can be cured):** While some conditions can be treated, the passage doesn't focus on cures for the exploitation itself. It highlights the dangers of being unaware of the situation.
* **C: Go ka naganwa gore ke merwalo ya motho o mongwe (It can be thought of as someone else's property):**  The passage discusses *your own* property (your belongings) being stolen. It doesn't address the idea of someone else mistaking something for theirs.
* **D: Maphodisa a ka nagana gore go ka ba go na le sethuthupi (Thieves might think there is a snake):** This is irrelevant to the main point of the passage, which is about the risk of being exploited by thieves and losing your belongings.



"
Ke eng seo se sa bolelwago karolong ye mabapi le go rwala diokobatši?,"The correct answer is **C: Dimpša tša go dupelela diokobatši di ka šomišwa o sa tsebe.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""O ka ikhweša o šomišwa bjalo ka morwadi wa diokobatši ntle le tsebo ya gago, seo se ka go tsenya ka gare ga mathata a magolo kudu."" (You can be exploited like a prostitute without your knowledge, which can lead to very serious problems.)
* Option C directly reflects this statement, highlighting the possibility of being trafficked without knowing it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dinageng tše dingwe, batho ba o e lego la mathomo ba dira bosenyi ba ka ahlolelwa lehu** - While human trafficking is a serious issue globally, the passage doesn't specifically mention early practices or the initial origins of trafficking.
* **B: O swanetše go ba šedi kudu ge o etela dinageng dišele** - The passage doesn't say you need to be extremely cautious when traveling to foreign countries. It focuses on the vulnerability to exploitation regardless of where you are.
* **D: Maphodisa a ka tšea merwalo ya gago, le ge o se wa rwala diokobatši** - The passage specifically discusses exploitation and trafficking, not general theft.  It focuses on being *exploited* against your will.



"
Ke dino dife tšeo di sa bolelwago e le tšeo o ka lekago go di dira ge o le maikhutšong gae?,"The correct answer is **B: Kofi (Coffee)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tlatša legae la gago ka kofi ya go topela mesong le teye ya chamomile mantšiboa."" which translates to ""Take a break with coffee that soothes the nerves and northern chamomile tea."" This implies that coffee is *not* something to do when you're stressed.

The other options are mentioned positively as things to do to relax:

*   **Jusi (Juice)**: While not directly mentioned as stress-relieving, having a healthy snack like juice isn't discouraged.
*   **Bjala (Beans)**: Similar to juice, not explicitly discouraged.
*   **Teye (Tea)**: Chamomile tea is specifically mentioned as a stress reliever.



"
Ke mafelo afe go ao a latelago ao o swanetšego go a etela ge o le maikhutšong a mo gae ge e ba motse wa geno o tsebja ka setšo sa go nwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Mafelo a go nwela bjala mo o sa yego gantši.**

Here's why:

The text suggests activities to do when you have free time while traveling.  It specifically mentions:

*   ""Ge o dula motseng wa go ba le setšo sa nwa sa go fapanafapana, sepela dipareng goba dipubong tša metseng ya kgauswi tšeo o sa yego gantši."" (When you're in a new town, explore parks or pubs in unfamiliar neighborhoods.)

This implies visiting places you don't normally go to. Option C directly aligns with this suggestion. Options A, B, and D are more common choices, not necessarily associated with exploring unfamiliar neighborhoods.



"
Dihlwadieme tša maeba di mo kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka jarateng ya kereke**.

The text states: ""Ka lapaleng la kereke, go na le dibetlwa tša mmabolo ya go kgahliša tša maeba godimo ga matlapa."" This translates to ""In the churchyard, there are burial mounds of sheep above the graves."" Therefore, the sheep bones are located near the church.
"
Ke mohuta ofe wa visa wo o ka nyakago gore motho a tšweletše bohlatse bja gore o na le thekgo e botse ya tšhelete?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ya moithuti**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Go ya moo bjalo ka moithuti wa go tšwa kantle ka kakaretšo go hloka ketelo ye teletšana go feta ge o le moeti wa go tlwalega."" (Going there as a full-time student requires a different visa than being a working tourist.)
* The text further details requirements for student visas, including proof of funds to cover living expenses.

Therefore, a student visa is specifically designed for individuals pursuing education and demonstrating financial stability.
"
Ke mang yo a ka nyakago visa ya go okeletšwa matšatši?,"The correct answer is **C: Moithuti wa go tšwa nageng e nngwe (A student from another country)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Go ya ka kakaretšo, go dula ka nageng ya kantle bakeng sa nako yeo e okedtšwego o tla swanela ke go hwetša visa e sa le nako. Divisa tša baithuti ka kakaretšo di na le dinyakwa tšeo difapafapaneng le ditshepedišo tša kgopelo go tšwa go divisa tša boeti ba go tlwaelega goba tša kgwebo."" This refers to students studying in a foreign country who require a student visa.
"
Ke neng mo o swanetšego go itlhokomela go menang?,"The correct answer is **C: Dithokgweng tša dipula (During storms)**.

The provided text specifically mentions that you need to be careful during storms when hiking, because lightning can enter the tent. Therefore, the answer relates to the specific situation described in the text.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, o swanetše go phema go dira’ng gore o se tshwenywe ke menang ge o otlela dithokgweng tša dipula?","The correct answer is **A: Go tlogela mabati a koloi a bulegile nako e telele.**

Here's why:

The passage states that snakes often hide in the engine compartment of cars.  The key advice is to avoid leaving the hood open for extended periods because this creates an opportunity for snakes to enter the car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go otlela moo ka selemo:**  This is irrelevant to snake safety in a car.
* **C: Go otlela mafelong a go ratwa ke phišo:** While avoiding areas known for snakes is good, the passage focuses on the specific hazard of the engine compartment.
* **D: Go tlogela koloi e se na motho ge o yo namela dithaba:** While it's generally safer to avoid being alone in remote areas, it doesn't directly address the snake risk mentioned in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe leo le sa bolelego nnete ka tikologo ya Sundarbans?","The correct answer is **D: Ke legae la go bonwa ga dikgama tše dintši go feta mapogo a Bengal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""go balelwa gore gabjale go ka ba go na le mapogo a 400 a Royal Bengal gomme dikgama tše e ka bago tše 30,000 di bonwe lefelong leo."" (it is estimated that there may be 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 deer spotted in the area).
* **Option D claims:** ""Ke legae la go bonwa ga dikgama tše dintši go feta mapogo a Bengal"" (It is a large place to see many deer more than Bengal tigers).
* **This is incorrect** because the passage explicitly mentions *fewer* deer (30,000) than tigers (400).  Therefore, Sundarbans is *not* primarily known for having many deer *more* than Bengal tigers.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: E na le tše dingwe tša dithokgwa tše dikgolo tše di sa šaletšego** (It has other large animals that are not listed): This is correct because the passage states there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 deer, implying other animals are present but not specifically quantified.
* **B: Seripagare sa tikologo e no ba meetse ao a emego felo gotee** (The ecosystem is mainly water that remains for a long time): This is correct because the passage identifies the area as ""mehlašana ya mangrove"" (mangrove forest), implying a water-logged ecosystem.
* **C: Ke lefelo le legolo lefaseng ka moka la go ba mehlašana ya mangrove** (It is the largest place in the world to have a mangrove forest): The passage directly states it is a ""mehlašana ya mangrove"" (mangrove forest), supporting this claim (although not explicitly stating it's the *largest* in the world).



"
Ke karolo efe ya lešoka yeo e lego ka gare ga India?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National Park**.

The text states: ""Karolo ya lešhoka ka gare ga naga ya India e bitšwa Sundarbans National Park."" (The part of the forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.)
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke bomang bao ba ka bago le kwešišo e lekanetšego ya Seisimane?","The correct answer is **B: Batho ba mengwaga ya tlase**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dinaga tše dintši kamoka di tseba English ka botlalo, gape le go ba bantši o ka letela tsebo yeo nnyane - kudu gare ga bana ba bannyane."" This translates to: ""Many people can speak English fluently, and many can learn a little knowledge - mostly among young children.""

This directly indicates that young children are more likely to have a good understanding of the language.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo go ka bago thata go se peleta?","The correct answer is **C: Mantšu a go ngwalwa (Spoken words)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mantšu ao a ngwadilwego gantši a bonolo go kwešišega go feta mantšu ao a boletšwego, gape.""  This translates to: ""Words that are written frequently are easier to understand than words that are spoken.""

The passage highlights that while people might understand different dialects (spoken languages) when they interact (like the example in Toronto), they often struggle with written words from those dialects. Therefore, the difficulty lies in understanding **spoken words** that are unfamiliar or unfamiliar in writing.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke seemo sefe seo se tla bago kaone go mosepedi yo a nyakago go namela pese go tloga seteišeneng sa dilete tše pedi?","The correct answer is **B: Mosepedi o lebile Bumthang gomme o swanetše go tloga ka iri ya 7.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that buses heading to Bumthang typically leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
* The question asks about someone traveling *from* a bus station to a destination.
* Option B correctly identifies traveling to Bumthang and needing to catch a bus around 7:00 AM.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While buying tickets in advance is recommended, it doesn't specify a destination or time.
* **C:** The passage mentions buses to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), but doesn't mention a 11:00 AM departure.
* **D:** Traveling to the ""bohlabela"" (east) is too vague, and the time ""before 6:20"" doesn't align with the typical departure times for Bumthang.



"
Leeto le lebotse e tla ba la mohuta mang go mosepedi yo a nyakago go ya ka bohlabela go tšwa seteišeneng sa dipese sa dilete tše pedi?,"The correct answer is **B: A reke thekete e sa le pele (Buy a ticket in advance)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""go a eletšwa go rekela setlankana matšatši a mmalwa pele"" which translates to ""it is advised to buy tickets a few days in advance.""
* The passage also mentions that the best buses for long distances depart between 6:30 and 7:30, but many buses are full, so advance booking is recommended.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dipese di tloga feela ka morago ga 8:30 (Buses only depart after 8:30)** - This contradicts the passage, which says buses leave as early as 6:30 and 7:30.
* **C: Dipese tše dintši di tloga mosegare ka moka (Many buses depart at night)** - The passage doesn't mention night departures.
* **D: Thekisi ya go hlakanelwa e ka ba tsela e kaone ya go sepela (A taxi can be a convenient way to travel)** - While taxis are mentioned as a way to reach distant places, the question asks about traveling *between* the bus stations of two towns, making a bus the more logical option.



"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo e sego tlhaloso ya nnete ya motse wa Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Go na le khuetšo e ntši Searaba go feta nageng ka moka**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Motse o fapane kudu go metse ye mengwe ya naga, ka lebaka la gore o na le bo Arabo go feta bo Afrika.""  This translates to ""The town is very different from other towns in the country, because it has more Arab influence than Africa."" Option A accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bodiidi bo iphile maatla (The community is alive with strength):** While the passage says Timbuktu is a lively place, it doesn't specifically focus on community strength.
* **C: O ka se fihle ka sefofane (You can reach it by plane):** The passage doesn't mention how to reach Timbuktu.
* **D: E sa dutše e gogela baeti ba go rata go bona mafelo (It doesn't cease to welcome visitors who like to see ruins):** The passage states that Timbuktu's ruins make it a popular destination, but it doesn't explicitly say it ""doesn't cease to welcome visitors.""

Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the text.
"
Ke lefoko lefe leo le bolelago nnete ka motse wa Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ga o na tsela ya go dira dilo ya Seafrika ya go swana le ya metse ya kgauswi le wona.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Motse o fapane kudu go metse ye mengwe ya naga, ka lebaka la gore o na le bo Arabo go feta bo Afrika."" (The town is very different from other towns in the country, because it has more Arab influence than Africa.)
* This difference in cultural influence means it doesn't follow the same way of doing things as other African towns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O ka fihla motseng wo ka sefofane:** The text doesn't mention anything about arriving in Timbuktu by plane.
* **B: Motse o a kgahliša go e na le go diila:** The text doesn't mention anything about Timbuktu being a popular destination.
* **D: Motse wo ga o sa gogela baeng:** The text doesn't mention anything about Timbuktu not welcoming visitors.



"
Mathomong diolimpiki tša selemo di be di beakanyeditšwe go swarwa neng? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ka March 2020**.

The text states: ""Ge e ba o beetše ka thoko senamelwa sa sefofane le madulo bakeng sa 2020 pele ga go tsebišo ya šutišetšopele e dirwa..."" which translates to ""When the flame and the ceremonies for 2020 were initially planned before the outbreak of the pandemic..."". This indicates the Olympics were initially scheduled for 2020, and the question asks when they were *beakanyeditšwe* (postponed/rescheduled).  The text doesn't explicitly state the rescheduling date, but it implies it happened before the pandemic outbreak.  However, based on historical fact and the context provided in the question (the postponement due to the pandemic), the answer is March 2020.

The text further confirms this by stating the Olympics actually took place in August 2021, but were *planned* for 2020. Therefore the initial rescheduling happened in March 2020.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke neng mo moya wa go fiša le wa go tonya di bakago ledimo le maatla?","The correct answer is **A: Ge diphefo di fihla mo e ka bago di-mile tše 100 ka iri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Di tšweletša memoya ya godimo (gantši dimile/iri tše 100-200) gomme di ka kgona go phagamiša dili tša boima, go di rwala bjale ka ge ledimo le legolo la pula le šuta."" (They rise into the upper air (often 100-200 miles) and can lift heavy things, crushing them when the storm is large and strong.) This indicates that the significant lifting and powerful force happen at that altitude. The other options describe earlier stages of the tornado's development."
Ke sefe sa dilo tše seo se bolelago nnete ka madimo a maatla?,"The correct answer is **C: Ge a se no kgoma fase a dira seo ekego ke fanele.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Di ka kgona go phagamiša dili tša boima, go di rwala bjale ka ge ledimo le legolo la pula le šuta. Di thoma bjalo ka di fanele go tšwa godimo go maru a ledimo, gomme dia ba """"""ditornadoe"""""" ge di kgoma fase.""  This translates to: ""They can lift heavy things, and destroy them when the storm is strong and rains. They start properly from above the ground, and become ""tornadoes"" when they hit the ground.""

* Option C directly reflects this statement about what happens when a thunderstorm cell hits the ground.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ka mehla a fehla diphefo tša mo e ka bago dimaele tše 100-200 ka iri** (They always reach heights of 100-200 miles).  The text says they reach 100-200 *kilometers*, not miles. Also, the text doesn't say they *always* reach that height.
* **B: Gantši a kuka dilo tše boima** (They often lift heavy things). While the text *does* mention lifting heavy things, it's more about the *destruction* that occurs when they hit the ground.
* **D: Ke dikarolo tša go dikologa tše di butšweletšago moya ka ntle** (They are parts of thunderstorms that circulate outside air). The text focuses on the movement of air *within* the thunderstorm cell, and the resulting effects.

The passage states: ""Baeletši e no ba kakaretšo ye kopana ya seemo sa dipolotiki ka nageng ye tee."" (Tour guides are a combined representation of the political climate in that country.)  The passage further explains that tour guides have diverse perspectives and knowledge.  Therefore, tour guides are the most likely source of information about the political situation in a country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ba mmušo wa naga yeo a e etelago** (The government of the country you are visiting) - While the government *is* a factor, it's not the *primary* source of understanding the nuances of the political climate.  Governments often present a particular image.
* **C: Go tšwa go badudi ba naga yeo ba e etelago** (From the people of the country you are visiting) - While the people's views are important, they are not necessarily a comprehensive or objective understanding of the *political climate*.
* **D: Go tšwa go mmušo wa bona** (From your own government) - Your own government's perspective is biased and might not accurately reflect the political situation in the country you are visiting.



"
"Tabeng ya baeletši ba tša maeto, motšwantle a ka no se bone diragalelwe ke eng?","The correct answer is **B: Ditaba tše di sa felelago ka seemo sa dipolotiki sa naga (Ongoing political news of the country)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Baeletši e no ba kakaretšo ye kopana ya seemo sa dipolotiki ka nageng ye tee"" which translates to ""Tour guides are a combination of the political climate of the country."" This means tour guides are influenced by and reflect the political situation.

The options relate to impacts or influences on tour guides. The passage directly links tour guides to the political climate of a country. Therefore, ongoing political news of the country is the most relevant factor influencing tour guides.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Go phumolwa mo go amegago ga inšorense ya tša maphelo (Getting insurance in an unstable insurance environment):** While insurance stability might be a concern for tourists, the passage doesn't explicitly connect it to tour guides.
*   **C: Go amega ga inšorense ya tša maphelo (Unstable life insurance):** Same reasoning as A.
*   **D: Ditaba tša go felela ka seemo sa dipolotiki sa naga (News of the end of the political climate of the country):** This is too extreme. The passage refers to the *current* political climate, not its end.

"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mohuta ofe wa leeto wo go ka diregago gore o se hloke thušo ya ba ditirelo tša maeto gore ba go thuše go beeletša?","The correct answer is **B: Leeto la dibeke tše pedi la go nyaka tšhelete e itšego.**

Here's why:

The passage states that many travelers work in the tourism industry, often earning enough to fund their trips independently. It also mentions the concept of ""thoko"" (a type of travel fund) and avoiding unnecessary expenses.

* **Option B** aligns with this idea. A two-week trip funded by personal savings implies the traveler has planned and budgeted for the expenses, suggesting they don't need travel agency assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Leeto la go ya sebokeng sa mošomo toropong yeo mosepedi a kilego a e etela:** While work trips can be independent, they often involve company-arranged travel arrangements, sometimes managed by travel agencies.
* **C: Leeto la go tlo baka bothata bja go kwana ka leleme:**  This implies a problematic situation, suggesting the traveler *might* need assistance, but it's not the primary point of the passage.
* **D: Leeto la pele la mosepedi la go ya nageng e šele:** First-time international trips often benefit from travel agency guidance, especially for visa requirements and navigating unfamiliar cultures.

Therefore, option B best reflects the spirit of the passage's emphasis on independent travel planning and funding.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke neng mo mosepedi a tlago go hloka thušo ya ditirelo tša maeto?","The correct answer is **A: Ge mosepedi a beeletša leeto la sefofane la go ya le go boa la go etela gae**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agencies have been around since the 19th century and are often chosen for complex trips involving flights, hotels, visas, and travel insurance.  The passage also mentions that people often use travel agencies when dealing with significant financial commitments or risks.  Option A, a long-distance trip involving travel and accommodation, best fits this description.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ge mosepedi a nyaka go beeletša leeto la go kgethega lekgeng la mathomo:** While some might use an agency for adventurous trips, it's not the primary reason stated in the passage.  The passage emphasizes complex travel arrangements.
* **C: Ge mosepedi a kgona leleme la mo a yago gona maikhutšong:** This is not related to travel agencies.
* **D: Ge mosepedi a etela lefelo leo a tlwaetšego setšo sa gona:**  This implies a simple trip to a familiar place and doesn't warrant the use of a travel agency.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se ka thušago moeti go phema go nyama ge a etela mafelo a maswa?","The correct answer is **A: Go letela maemo a go swana le a mo ba tšwago gona.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that things like customs, laws, food, and even basic etiquette will differ in a new location. It specifically advises against assuming things will be the same as where you come from.  Therefore, understanding and adapting to the local customs and situation (maemo a go swana le a mo ba tšwago gona) is crucial for avoiding offense and staying safe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go ikemišetša go leka dijo tše o sa di tsebego:** While trying new foods can be part of the experience, it's not the primary factor in preventing unwanted attention or danger.
* **C: Go latela melao ya go swana le mo ba tšwago:**  The passage specifically warns against *assuming* the laws are the same.
* **D: Phema go dira dinyakišišo tša madulo e sa le pele:**  This is irrelevant to the passage's main point about cultural adaptation.



"
"Go ya ka tsebišo yeo e lego karolong, ke motho wa mohuta mang yo a ka nyamago ge a tšea leeto la go ya nageng e šele?","The correct answer is **B: Motho wa go rata go bona phetogo**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that things like customs, laws, food, and even the way people behave will be different in a new country.  Someone who enjoys change and new experiences would be more receptive to these differences.  The passage explicitly warns against expecting things to be the same as they are at home.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Motho wa go rata dijo tše di sa tlwaelegago (Someone who likes unusual food):** While trying new foods might be a part of traveling, the passage is broader than just food.
* **C: Motho wa monagano o tswalelegilego (A predictable/conventional person):** The passage explicitly discourages expecting things to be predictable.
* **D: Motho wa go rata go ithuta (Someone who likes to learn):**  While learning is often part of travel, the passage focuses more on adaptability and embracing differences than specifically on academic learning.
"
Ke keletšo efe go tšeo di latelago yeo e sa kgothaletšwego go baeti bao ba thomago go etela dinaga tšeo di hlabologilego?,"The correct answer is **A: Tseba diphoofolo tša lefelong leo pele o ka robala fase** (Be aware of the animals you might encounter when sleeping on the ground).

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes being cautious about wildlife, especially when camping or sleeping outdoors. It explicitly warns against sleeping on the ground without being aware of potential dangers.
* Options B, C, and D are not supported by the passage.  The passage suggests using established accommodations, being mindful of surroundings, and bringing appropriate camping gear, but doesn't discourage spending money on food, sleeping in a tent, or staying in higher-end hotels.

Therefore, being aware of animals and their potential presence is the most pertinent and cautioned advice given in the passage.



"
Ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo go sa bolelwago ka sona bjalo ka selo sa go senya tšhelete ge o tlwaela naga e hlabologilego?,"The correct answer is **A: Mohuta wa dijo tša ka Bodikela (Local cuisine)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on avoiding common pitfalls when traveling to a new place. It specifically mentions:

*   **Photography:** Being careful with your camera to avoid theft.
*   **Wildlife:** Being aware of animals and plants, and taking precautions.
*   **Sleeping Arrangements:** Using reputable accommodations (hotels, campsites, hammocks) and being mindful of where you sleep.

The question asks what is *not* mentioned as a potential expense when traveling to a new, ""healthy"" country (I assume ""healthy"" refers to a well-established tourism destination).

*   **Local cuisine (Mohuta wa dijo tša ka Bodikela)** is something you *choose* to spend money on. It's a discretionary expense.
*   **Local experiences (Ditirelo tša maemo)** are often paid for.
*   **Sleeping arrangements (Materase goba sepontšhe sa go robala ka ntle)** are a necessary expense.
*   **High-end hotels (Dihotele tša maemo)** are a paid expense.

Therefore, local cuisine is the only option that is explicitly something you *spend* money on, and the question asks what isn't mentioned as an expense.



"
"Ke efe ya dikgetho tšeo di latelago yeo e ka bago kaone go mong wa pholisi ge a nyaka khopi ya kgonthe ya pholisi ya gagwe, efela a se na inthanete?","The correct answer is **C: Go boloka khopi ka gare ga lepothopo ya bona**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ge o sepela le laptop goba tablet, boloka khopi ka gare ga kgopotša ya yona goba deski (yeo e hwetšagalago ntle le inthanete).""  This translates to: ""When you travel with a laptop or tablet, keep a copy in your memory stick or on a desk (which is accessible without internet).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go nea yo o tšeago leeto le yena khopi (Give a copy to someone traveling):** While sharing a copy is good, the question asks about what a person can do *themselves* if they have no internet.
* **B: Go ithomela khopi ka emeile (Email a copy):** This requires internet access, which the question states is unavailable.
* **D: Go boloka khopi ka gare ga lenaneo la “cloud” (Keep a copy in a ""cloud"" program):**  ""Cloud"" programs require internet access to store and retrieve data, again contradicting the question's premise.



"
"Go ya karolo ye, ke efe go tše di latelago go sa hlokagalego gore e bontšhwe pholising?","The correct answer is **D: Emeile aterese ya mong wa pholisi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically instructs you to *not* share the email address of the police officer. The passage emphasizes sharing copies of your insurance information with the insurance provider and emergency numbers. It *does* mention sharing copies of your policy with those who might need to assist you in case of an accident.  However, it doesn't mention sharing the police officer's email.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke bogolo bofe bja nekethifi bjo bo bontšhago sebopego sa filimi seo se dirišwago kudu?","The correct answer is **C: 35 mm nekethifi**.

The passage states: ""Filimi ya 35 mm ya go lekanela (36 ka 24 mm negetifi) ke ya go tlwaelega kudu."" This directly identifies the 35mm film format as the most common.
"
Ke mehuta efe ya filimi yeo e bonagalago kudu go swana le DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Filimi ya 35 mm**.

The text explicitly states: ""Filimi ya 35 mm ya go lekanela (36 ka 24 mm negetifi) ke ya go tlwaelega kudu. Gantši e ka tlaleletšwa botse ga bonolo ge o ka felelwa, gomme e fa ditlamo go bapetša ka go tswana le DSLR ya bjale.""  (35mm film is quite common. It can often be obtained easily and provides a good analogy to a modern DSLR.)



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Filimi ya bogolo bja magareng (Large format film):** The text implies this is less common and more complex than 35mm.
* **C: Filimi ya 56 x 56 mm:** The text mentions this as an alternative and requires four 35mm negatives for equivalent coverage, highlighting its difference from 35mm.
* **D: Filimi ya 6x6cm:** This is explicitly stated as a different format from 35mm.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mogato ofe wo e bego e tla ba wa mafelelo wa go thoma kgwebo ya go ngwala ka maeto?","The correct answer is **C: Itirele wepesaete ya gago**.

Here's why:

The passage states the goal is to eventually have your own website *after* you've gotten comfortable with working on a platform. Option C directly reflects this final step.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Itlwaetše go beakanya wepesaete** - This is an early step, not the final goal.
*   **B: Ngwala ditaba tše mmalwa ka wepesaete ya maeto ya go tuma gabotse** - This describes the *process* of blogging, not the final business outcome.
*   **D: Kaonafatša bokgoni bja gago bja go rulaganya** - This is a necessary skill, but not the final action in starting a travel writing business.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the passage is that the ultimate goal is to establish your own website.
"
"Ge o thoma kgwebo ya go ngwala ka tša maeto, ke mabokgoni afe ao a swanetšego go kaonafatšwa pele?","The correct answer is **A: Go ngwala (Writing)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what skills need to be improved *first* when starting a travel writing business. The initial focus must be on the core skill: **writing**. You need to be able to write compelling travel content before you can think about website development or organization.

While website development (B) and organization (C) are important, they come *after* you have something to put on the website – which is content created through writing.

Therefore, **writing** is the foundational skill to develop initially.
"
Ke maemo a afe a leratadima ao gantši mathata a mala a bago gona?,"The correct answer is **A: Maemo a leratadima a go tonya** (Conditions of the gut that are threatened).

The passage states: ""Bjalo ka mathata a go hema ka gare ga maemo a leratadima a go tonya, mathata a mala ka gare ga maemo a leratadima a tloga a tlwaelegile gomme dinakong tše dintši a šišimiša efela ga a tloge a le kotsi.""

This translates to: ""However, when there are problems with fermentation in the gut, the problems become abnormal in the gut conditions and often escalate to become dangerous.""

Therefore, the problems become abnormal *in the gut conditions that are threatened*.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, go phela motho a tšea maeto go ka baka mathata afe a tša maphelo?","The correct answer is **C: Mathata a go hema**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bjalo ka mathata a go hema ka gare ga maemo a leratadima a go tonya..."" (However, due to digestive problems in hot climates...) This directly links travel to digestive issues. While other options might be *related* to travel, the passage's direct connection is to digestive problems.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Mathata a mala (Color problems):** The passage mentions color changes *as a symptom* of digestive problems, but the primary issue is digestive.
*   **B: Ditwatši tša lefelong (Household belongings):** The passage doesn't mention household belongings.
*   **D: Delhi Belly:** Delhi Belly is given as an *example* of a digestive problem, but the overarching issue is digestive problems in general.



"
Ke eng go tšeo di latelago e nago le mohola ge o tšea leeto Schengen zone?,"The correct answer is **A: Go phema dikgopelo tše dintši tša visa**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the Schengen Area allows you to travel without needing multiple visas. It mentions that with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for visas for each Schengen country individually.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go boloka tšhelete:** While the Schengen visa can save money on visa fees, the primary benefit highlighted is avoiding multiple visa applications, not directly saving money in general.
* **C: Go phema mafelo a mantši a go hlahloba dipaseporoto:**  The Schengen Area is *designed* to reduce passport checks. The text says you don't need to go through passport control at each border.
* **D: Paseporoto ga e nyakege:** A passport is still *required* to enter the Schengen Area. The text doesn't say you don't need a passport.



"
Ke eng seo se ka se sa hwetšagalago ka lebitleng la Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Mahumo**.

The text states: ""Mahumo a mabotse a lebitla ga a sa le ka gare ga lona, efela a tlošeditšwe go ya Egyptian Museum go la Cairo."" which translates to ""The golden artifacts of the tomb are not inside it, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.""
"
"Go ya karolo, ke kae mo baeti bao ba tshwenyegilego ka tšhelete ba ka se go thabelego kua Vancouver? ","The correct answer is **A: Granville Island**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sehlakahlaka sa Bowen ke lefelo la boeti ba leeto la letšatši goba mafelelo a beke lago tuma la go abelana ka kayaking, go tšea leeto le le telele ka maoto, mabenkele, mafelo a go jela, le tše dingwe."" This implies Bowen Island has various activities, including food and shopping, making it accessible and potentially affordable.

Granville Island is mentioned as having ""mabenkele, mafelo a go jela"" (shops, restaurants), suggesting a place where people can enjoy activities without necessarily breaking the bank.

The other options are less likely:

* **Lewatle la go ya kgorong ya legodimo (Going to the top of the mountains):** This implies more expensive activities like gondola rides or mountain excursions.
* **Whistler:** While a popular destination, Whistler is generally considered more expensive than Bowen Island or Granville Island. 

Therefore, **Granville Island** is the most fitting option based on the information provided in the text.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefelo lefe leo le ka fago baeti maitemogelo a mabotse a Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen Island**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sehlakahlaka sa Bowen ke lefelo la boeti ba leeto la letšatši goba mafelelo a beke lago tuma la go abelana ka kayaking...Setšhaba se sa nnete se hwetšwa ka Howe Sound go tšwa gannyane ka Vancouver, gomme a hwetšega ka ditekisi tša meetse tša go beakantšwa go tloga Granvill Island bofase bja toropo ya Vancouver.""

This directly links Bowen Island to activities and locations near Vancouver, making it the best answer.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, baeti ba swanetše go etela Diphororo neng ge ba nyaka go di bona gabotse?","The correct answer is **A: Ka November go fihla ka March**.

The passage states: ""Sehlang sa dipula (Nofemere go fihla go Matšhe), bolumu ya meetse e tla ba godimo gomme Mawa a tla phagama kudu."" This means the rainy season is from November to March, and the water levels are high.  It then advises people to avoid visiting during this time. Therefore, to see the Victoria Falls at their best, you should visit **before** the rainy season, which is **November to March**.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng sa go se kgahliše ge o etela Victoria Falls magareng ga November le March?","The correct answer is **D: Go phema sehla sa dipula** (Experiencing the full force of the rain).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sehlang sa dipula (Nofemere go fihla go Matšhe), bolumu ya meetse e tla ba godimo gomme Mawa a tla phagama kudu. O netefaletšwa go tapa ge o ka tshela leborogo goba wa sepela kgauswi le ditsejana tša go ba thoko ga Diphororo. Ka letsogong le lengwe, ke ka lebaka la gore tekano ya meetse e godimo kudu ka moo go lebelela ga gago ga go tšholloga go ka šitišwago - ke meetse kamoka!""

This translates to: ""The rainy season (from November to March), the water volume will be high and the Mawa will rise greatly. You are certain to get wet if you live or are near Victoria Falls. At times, because the water level is so high, it can be dangerous - it's torrential rain!""

Therefore, the biggest drawback of visiting during those months is experiencing the full force of the rain.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diphororo tše di sa širwago ke selo** (Unseen waterfalls are not a problem): The passage describes the falls as a major attraction.
*   **B: Baeti ba sego kae** (Few tourists are there): The passage doesn't mention tourist numbers.
*   **C: Diponagalo tša go kgahliša kudu tša Diphororo** (The most impressive sights of Victoria Falls): The passage indicates that the high water level *can* obscure some of the views, not that they are more impressive.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se sa kgothaletšwego ge o šomiša terouno go tšea bidio?","The correct answer is **A: Go botšiša e sa le pele gore o dumeletšwe go fota eng.**

The text explicitly states: ""Ge o šomiša setšeadiswantšho sa go fofa (drone), lekodišiša gabotse pele gore ke eng seo o dumeletšwego go se gatiša le gore ke ditumelelo dife goba dilaesense tša tlaleletšo tšeo di hlokagalago.""  This emphasizes the importance of checking permissions *before* flying and recording.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Go hwetša tumelelo ya tlaleletšo:** While obtaining permits might be necessary, the text stresses *knowing what you're allowed to film* first. Permits are a consequence of that knowledge.
* **C: Go nyakišiša ka ditumelelo:** Relying solely on permissions without understanding the restrictions isn't safe.
* **D: Go fota feela mafelong a go tlala ka batho mo terouno e ka se lemogwego:** This is illegal and unsafe, directly contradicting the text's warnings about flying over people and the importance of legal compliance.

Therefore, the most direct answer based on the text is to check permissions before filming.
"
"Go ya karolo ye, ke mafelo afe a maleba mo o ka tšeago dinepe ka terouno?","The correct answer is **D: Mafelong ao pele o šetšego o hweditše tumelelo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ge o šomiša setšeadiswantšho sa go fofa (drone), lekodišiša gabotse pele gore ke eng seo o dumeletšwego go se gatiša le gore ke ditumelelo dife goba dilaesense tša tlaleletšo tšeo di hlokagalago.""  This means you need permission (tumelelo) *before* flying a drone in a particular area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kgauswi le lešaba la batho leo le ka se tshwenywego ke ge terouno e le gona:** While avoiding people is important, the text doesn't specify this as a reason for flying a drone *without* permission.
* **B: Mafelong ao go sa dumelelwago go tšea dinepe ka mehla:** This is too broad. The text says you need to check for permissions *before* flying.
* **C: Mafelong a leemaema moo terouno e ka se bonagalego kudu:**  Even in remote areas, you still need to adhere to regulations and obtain necessary permissions.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefoko lefe leo e sego la nnete mabapi le ditshwanelego tša go ingwadišetša visa?","The correct answer is **B: Dinaga ka moka di hloka go ingwadiša go ba molao ba lefelong.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that in many countries, you *do* need to verify your qualifications and address. This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ge o dula madulong a baeng ba go bona naga, go ka no se hlokagale gore o ingwadiše:** The passage says you *do* need to verify your information, so this is incorrect.
* **C: Go etela diofisi tša bafaladi go ka hlokega:** The passage states that visiting diplomatic offices *is* a requirement in some cases.
* **D: Mafelong a mangwe, go ka ingwadišwa dihoteleng tša lefelong leo:** The passage mentions that hotels can verify information in some instances, so this is correct.



Therefore, the only incorrect statement is that countries *always* require visa verification.



"
Ke lefelong lefe go ao a latelago leo e sego lefelo leo baeng ba go tla go bona naga ba ka ingwadišago gona?,"The correct answer is **B: Hotele yeo ba dulago go yona**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dinageng tše dintši tša go ba le melao ye me bjalo, dihotele tša gae di tla swaragana le boingwadišo (netefatša gore o a botšiša).""  This directly translates to: ""In many countries with such rules, hotels will arrange for the verification (make sure you ask).""

Therefore, hotels are often the place where visa verification takes place, or at least where arrangements are made for it.



The other options are not mentioned in the text as places for visa verification.

*   **A: Seteišeneng sa maphodisa sa lefelong** (Local police station) - Not mentioned.
*   **C: Ofisi ya poso ya lefelong** (Local post office) - Not mentioned.
*   **D: Diofising tša bafaladi** (Lawyers' offices) -  Mentioned as a possibility, but hotels are presented as a more common and arranged option."
Ke mang yo a ka se holegego ka go ithaopa ge a tšere maeto?,"The correct answer is **C: Motho yo a holofelago go hwetša bokgoni bjo boswa.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that traveling alone is a good way to learn about oneself, develop independence, gain confidence, and discover hidden talents.  Option C directly reflects this idea of personal growth and skill development.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Motho yo a ikemišeditšego go dira bagwera ba baswa nageng e šele** - While a possible motivation, it's not the core benefit highlighted in the passage.
*   **B: Motho yo a nyakago mogolo o wa go bonala** -  This is not directly supported by the text.
*   **D: Motho yo a ka bago le kgahlego ya phaphoši le fenišara** - While potentially a positive outcome, it's not the primary focus of the passage on the benefits of solo travel.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, go ithaopa o dula nageng e šele go na le mehola efe go motho wa go sepela ka tšhelete ya go lekanela?","The correct answer is **B: Gantši o feleletša o hwetša mošomo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go dula le go ithaopa nageng ya ka ntle ke tsela ye botse ya go tseba ditšo tša go fapana, go kopana le batho ba baswa, go ithuta ka wena, go hwetša mokgwa wa kgopolo le go hwetša mabokgoni a maswa.

This implies that while there are challenges (like potential financial struggles), a common outcome of traveling is finding work.  Options A, C, and D are less directly supported by the passage. While options C and D *could* be true, the passage focuses on the opportunity for work and personal growth.
"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo ka kakaretšo se ka tšewago se sa tlwaelega ka leeto la go ya Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **A: Go fetša beke o bona di phaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Go etela Walt Disney World go emela karolo ye kgolo ya boeti bjo bokgethwa bakeng sa malapa a mantši a ma-America"" which translates to ""Visiting Walt Disney World represents a major part of the cherished traditions for many American families."" It then describes a typical trip as involving staying at a Disney resort, visiting the parks, and returning home.  The key phrase is ""Dithekete tše dintši tšeo di rekišitšwego mo dikgolaganyong tša inthanete ka diweposaete tša fantisi tše bjalo ka eBay goba Craigslist go ke dithekete tšeo di šomišitšwego gannyane letšatšing leo,"" which means ""Many tickets purchased on online marketplaces like eBay or Craigslist are used for short periods."" This suggests an *unusual* way to experience Disney World - buying used tickets for a short visit, rather than a full week's immersion in the parks. The options are incorrect because they describe typical, not unusual, aspects of a Disney World trip.
"
Ke lefoko lefe go ao a latelago leo e sego la nnete ka Walt Disney World ?,"The correct answer is **A: Dithekete tša baeng di ka kgona go fetišetšwa go baeti ba bangwe**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dithekete tše dintši tšeo di rekišitšwego mo dikgolaganyong tša inthanete ka diweposaete tša fantisi tše bjalo ka eBay goba Craigslist go ke dithekete tšeo di šomišitšwego gannyane letšatšing leo. Le ge se e le mošongwana wa tlwaelo, o ganetšwa ke Disney: dithekete ga di fetišetšwe.""  This means that tickets bought on resale websites are often invalid and Disney doesn't validate them. Option A reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go na le madulo lefelong leo:** The text mentions staying at Disney hotels and the Disney Value resort. This is a true statement.
* **C: Go na le dipese tša go sepetša baeti go tloga boemafofane go ya lefelong leo:**  The text describes transportation options, but doesn't specify the existence of discounted transportation. While it's *possible*, the text doesn't explicitly state this as a fact.
* **D: Gantši dithekete tša go šoma matšatši a mantši di ka hwetšwa go diwepesaete tša go rekiša:** The text states the opposite - that tickets bought on resale sites are often invalid. Therefore, this statement is false.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke mathata afe go ao a latelago ao a ka no se akaretšwego klaseng ya tlwaetšo ya go ba setsebi goba ka dikgatišong?","The correct answer is **B: Go itokišeletša maemo a thušo ya pele**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a wilderness survival course. A key component of such a course is learning first aid.  The passage mentions ""thušo ya pele ye ntši"" (basic first aid training). Therefore, preparing for first aid is a crucial element that would be covered in a wilderness survival course and is likely a difficulty encountered during the training.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Go phologa lešokeng (Staying calm in a crisis):** While important, staying calm is a general skill applicable in many stressful situations, not specifically a core element of a wilderness survival *course*.
*   **C: Go itokišeletša nako ya ntwa (Preparing for the weather):** Preparing for weather is important for wilderness survival, but the passage specifically mentions first aid training as an initial part of the course.
*   **D: Go ekiša motho yo mongwe (Evacuating someone):** Evacuation is a later stage of survival and not usually covered in the initial phases of a wilderness survival course.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke efe ya dithuto tše di latelago yeo go nago le kgonagalo e kgolo ya gore e akaretšwe ka klaseng ya tlwaetšo ya go ba setsebi?","The correct answer is **B: Mafelo a ntwa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Thutišo gantši e tla akaretša ditaba ka moka tšeo di boletšwego mo ka go tsenelela, gantši ka maitemogelo a go diragatša ka matsogo. **Dipuku le dimakasine tša go bolela ka tša go phela sethokgweng di tlwaelegile, efela di patlalatšwa tša go bolela ka mafelo a dintwa ke tše dinnyane.**""

This means the training includes information about wildlife. The other options are not mentioned in the passage.
"
"Go ya le ka karolo ye, ke tsela efe ya go phema meetse ao a ka bago a šilafetše?","The correct answer is **D: Hlahloba meetse ge e ba a le boemong bjo bobotse (Check if the water is in a safe condition).**

Here's why:

* The text says that sometimes it's okay to boil water for a short time, but *first* you need to check its condition. Boiling isn't a guaranteed solution if the water is already contaminated.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Bediša meetse metsotso e mmalwa (Boil water for a few minutes):**  While boiling can help, it's not the first step. You need to determine if the water *needs* boiling in the first place.
* **B: Reka meetse ao a lego ka gare ga lebotlelo (Buy water that's in a container):** This is a solution *after* the water is contaminated, not how to treat already contaminated water.
* **C: Bediša meetse motsotso o mo tee (Boil water for a short time):** Similar to A, this assumes boiling is the only solution and doesn't address checking the water's condition.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke eng seo se ka se kgonagalego le go baruthi bao ba nago le bokgoni?","The correct answer is **C: Go rutha kgahlanong le meetse a go elela (Swimming against the current)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions that strong currents can make it difficult to swim, and people may struggle to reach the shore.
* Option C directly addresses this difficulty – swimming against a current.
* The passage also highlights the danger of being swept away and needing to wait for rescue, further supporting the idea that swimming against the current is a challenging task.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go rutha kgauswi le maswika (Swimming against sharks):** While sharks are dangerous, the passage focuses on the *current* as the primary obstacle.
* **B: Go rutha ka gare ba meetse a go iša (Swimming within the water to get out):** This is too general. The passage is about the *current* making it difficult to get out.
* **D: Go rutha go dikologa maphoto (Swimming to avoid photo traps):** The passage mentions photo traps but doesn't focus on swimming *to avoid* them. The primary problem is the current.



"
O swanetše gore o dire eng ge o ka kgakgelwa bogareng bja meetse?,"The correct answer is **B: Rutha ka lebelo kgahlanong le meetse** (Wait for rescue in relation to the water).

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes waiting for rescue.** It states, ""Leka go lebiša go gongwe moo o ka se tswarwego gape goba, go ya le ka makgoni a gago le gore naa o bonwi, o ka nyaka go ema bakeng sa go phološwa."" (Try to find a place where you haven't been spotted yet, depending on your strength and whether you are visible, you may want to wait for rescue.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Leka go tšwa ka gare ga meetse ka lehlakoreng le lengwe, ke moka rutha o boela morago lebopong ka mokgwa wa tlwaelo** (Try to get out of the water on one side, then wait for rescue in the back the normal way) - While getting out of the water is ideal, the text *primarily* advises waiting for rescue, especially if you're struggling.
* **C: Rutha o ya ka lehlakoreng le le fapanego** (Wait by a different side) - This is not necessarily better and might even make you more visible to rescuers.
* **D: Rutha ka fase ga meetse** (Wait underwater) - This is extremely dangerous and will quickly lead to drowning.



"
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke lefelo lefe la meago ya ditora leo e ka bago maikhutšo a mabotse?","The correct answer is **C: Ka gare ga Rhine Valley**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""moedi wa Rhine"" (Rhine River) and ""go sepela ka sekepe go ya ditoropong tša go kgahliša go Danube"" (boating to charming towns along the Danube).  The Rhine Valley is the region where the Rhine River flows, making it the most direct and relevant answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Toropo go bapa le Danube** - While charming towns *are* along the Danube, the passage focuses on the Rhine Valley specifically.
*   **B: Kgauswi le Erie Canal** - The Erie Canal is mentioned as an example of a waterway for boat trips, but the Rhine Valley is presented as a more prominent example.
*   **D: Kgauswi le noka le ge e le efe ya nageng** - This is too general and doesn't pinpoint a specific location mentioned in the text."
"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke selo sefe go tše di latelago e ka se bego maele a mabotse go mosadi yo a etelago lefelong leo?","The correct answer is **A: O se ke wa bolela ka seemo sa lenyalo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Go a kgothaletšwa gore basadi ba fe goba ba fe ba baeti ba re ba nyetšwe, go sa kgathalege maemo a bona a lenyalo."" (It is encouraged that women, regardless of their marital status, are treated as guests when they are invited.)  The following sentence emphasizes that women should refuse unwanted advances and stand up for themselves.  Therefore, avoiding any mention of marital status is key to avoiding unwanted attention and potential problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tseba gore diphapano tša setšo di ka hlohleletša batho ba lefelong leo go se kwane le wena** (Know that differences in appearance can mislead people in that environment.) While it's true differences in appearance *could* lead to issues, the main advice is to avoid *bringing up* those differences.
* **C: Tlogela go apara mebenyabje a go phadima** (Avoid wearing revealing clothes.) The text advises against revealing clothing, but doesn't explicitly say to avoid ""mebenyabje a go phadima"" (revealing jumpsuits).
* **D: Tiiša ka ganong ge go nyakega** (Refuse firmly when necessary.) While the text *does* say to refuse, the question asks for the *most* important piece of advice from the passage. Avoiding mentioning marital status is a foundational element of preventing unwanted attention.



"
"Ka baka la lefelo leo go boletšwego ka lona karolong ye, ke maele afe a mabotse ao a ka thušago basadi bao ba etelago moo?","The correct answer is **A: Lemoga gore ga se gwa tlwaelega go šalwa morago**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...Basadi ba swanetše go lemoga gore phapano ya ditšo e ka dira gore go be le seo ba ka se bonago bjalo ka hlokofatšo gomme ga se seo se sa tlwaelegano go šalwa morago, go gogwa ka letsogo, bjbj.""  This translates to: ""...Women should realize that differences in appearance can lead to something they perceive as harassment and not something unusual to be ignored, etc."" This directly supports understanding that being approached is not necessarily normal or acceptable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Apara palamonwana ye kgolo go bontšha gore o nyetšwe:** The text advises *against* wearing overly revealing clothing.
* **C: Kwešiša gore go fapana ga ditšo go šišinya gore o se leke go ikemelela:** While self-respect is important, the text focuses on understanding harassment, not on asserting independence through appearance.
* **D: Ge e ba o sa nyake go ferewa, gana banna o tiišitše:** This is good advice, but the text emphasizes understanding that unwanted attention itself is not normal. Option A addresses the root of the problem, while option D addresses a response to it.

"Go ya ka karolo ye, ke boemong bofe mo go ka nyakegago gore motšeadinepe wa diphoofolo tša nageng a šomiše dilentshe tšeo di kgethegilego?","The correct answer is **A: Ge a fota diphoofolo tše dinnyane dinepe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ge tšea diswantšho tša diphoofolo tša naga gantši go tšeelwa fase, efela go tswana le go tšea dinswantšho ka kakaretšo, setswantšho se na le boleng bja matšu a dikete. **Ge tšea diswantšho tša diphoofolo tša naga gantši go hloka telephoto lens, le ge dilo tša go swana le sehlopa sa dinonyane goba sephedi se se nnyane di hloka di lens tše dingwe.**"" This directly indicates that a telephoto lens is needed when photographing small animals (and by extension, small animals are what would require specialized lenses).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ge e ba dinepe di rekišwa:**  The passage doesn't link the purchasing of specimens to the need for specialized lenses.
*   **C: Ge e ba diphoofolo tšeo di tšewago dinepe di na le dihlong:** While the passage mentions animals can be venomous or dangerous, it doesn't connect venomousness to the need for specialized lenses.
*   **D: Ge e ba phaka e na le melao e kgethegilego mabapi le go fota diphoofolo dinepe:**  The passage mentions regulations, but again, it doesn't connect regulations directly to the need for specialized lenses.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that specialized lenses are needed when photographing small animals.
"
Ke selo sefe seo go sa bolelwego ka sona karolong ye seo e ka bago hlohlo e kgolo go batšea dinepe ba diphoofolo?,"The correct answer is **D: Go šomela mafelong a sa kgahlišego (Working in unapproved locations)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Diphaka ka dinako tše dingwe di na le melao mabapi le go tšea dinepe ka mabaka a kgwebo."" (Sometimes, there are regulations regarding collecting specimens for commercial purposes.) This implies that collecting specimens in unapproved locations could be illegal or restricted.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Go hwetša diphoofolo tše itšego di sa tlwaelegago (Finding unusual creatures):** The text mentions it's difficult to find unusual creatures, but it doesn't say it's *not* possible to find them.
*   **B: Go šomana le diphoofolo tša bogale (Dealing with venomous creatures):** The text acknowledges the danger of venomous creatures but doesn't say it's *not* possible to deal with them. It just warns about the risks.
*   **C: Go hwetša mohuta wa dilentshe tše di nyakegago (Finding the required type of lens):** The text discusses the need for specific lenses, but it doesn't say it's impossible to find them. It just mentions the need for them.



"
Ke selo sefe go tše di latelago seo se ka fokoletšago mootledi mathata ge a otlela dithabeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Sephetephete (Lightning)**.

The passage explicitly states that lightning is a significant hazard when hiking in mountains, mentioning its potential for causing severe injuries. The other options are not directly related to the dangers of mountain hiking as described in the text.
"
Ke eng seo se tla dulago se swana mabapi le lekgetho la letseno dinageng tša go fapafapana?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo o faelago gona**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...motšhelo wa letseno o beakantšwe ka mo go fapafapanego dinageng tša go fapafapana, gomme dipeelo tša motšhelo di fapafapana kudu go tšwa nageng ye ngwe go ya go ye nwge.""  It also mentions that in countries like the US and Canada, taxes are levied at both governmental and household levels. The key point is that **where you reside** is what determines the specifics of your tax obligations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ditefelo (Rates):** Tax *rates* vary significantly between countries.
* **B: Sebopego (Structure):** The *structure* of the tax system (how it's organized) is different in each country.
* **D: Mašakana (Amounts):** The *amounts* of taxes paid differ greatly.

The passage highlights the fundamental difference: the tax system is tied to your **location/residency**.



"
"Go ya le ka karolo ye, ge e ba o šoma moše wa mawatle efela o dula go gongwe, gantši o tlo lefa kae metšhelo ya gago ya letseno?","The correct answer is **C: Ka nageng ye o šomago go yona gona bjale**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go šoma mošamawatle ka kakaretšo go bolela gore o tla tswanela ke go ingwaditšetša tax ya letseno nageng yeo o lego go yona."" (Working abroad generally means you will be liable for income tax in the country where you are located.)

Option C directly reflects this statement. While other options *could* be possible depending on specific circumstances, the general rule according to the passage is taxation in the country where you are working.
"
Ke mafoko afe go ao a latelago a sa hlalosego ka nepo Pontšho ya Lefase?,"The correct answer is **D: Ga go hlokagale gore dinaga di tšee karolo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ge fela e le dinageng tša go fapanafapana"" (depending on the country). This implies that the World's Fair doesn't always happen every year, and participation isn't guaranteed.
* **Option D** directly reflects this ambiguity. The passage doesn't explicitly say that participation *is* annual or *is* guaranteed.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Diswantšho di ka bontšha histori goba setšo sa naga:** The passage *does* state this (""go laetša mathata a lefase goba setšo sa naga e histori"").
* **B: Diswantšho tša dimela di bontšhwa gotee le diswantšho tša bokgabo le tša thuto:**  The passage *does* specifically mention botanical exhibitions (""Pontšho ya Lefase yeo e kgethegilego yeo e bontšago malomo, dirapana tša dimela le tše dingwe tša go amana le dimela"").
* **C: Meletlo e ka tšea dikgwedi tše tshela:** The passage *does* state this (""Meletlo ye gantši e fetša nako ya go lekana gare ga dikgwedi tše tharo le tše tshela"").



"
Ke efe go tšeo di latelago e lego molao wa Dipontšho tša Lefase goba Pontšho ya Ditšhabatšhaba?,"The correct answer is **D: Gore pontšho e swarwe, dinaga ka moka di swanetse go tšea karolo** (For a show to be held, countries must collectively participate).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dinaga tšeo di tšeago karolo di aba diswantšho tša bokgabo le thutodi pavilion tša bosetšhaba go laetša mathata a lefase goba setšo sa naga le histori."" (Countries that want to participate set up cultural and educational pavilions to address global issues or showcase their national image and history.)
* **This implies:** Participation is a *collective* effort. A World Expo isn't just *held*; it's *organized* by the participating countries.
* **Options A, B, and C are not directly supported by the passage.** While the passage mentions history and global issues, it doesn't say a show *must* cover both. It also mentions varying frequencies, but doesn't say a country *can* hold it every year. The duration is mentioned, but not as a strict requirement.



Therefore, the most accurate statement about the requirements of World Expos is that countries need to participate to make the event happen.



"
Ke go dira selo sefe go tše di latelago moo go ka fokotšago kgonagalo ya go hlaselwa ke diphoofolo?,"The correct answer is **B: Go tloša ditlakala lefelong la kampa**.

Here's why:

* **B (Go tloša ditlakala lefelong la kampa - Hang food at the campsite):** This is the most important safety measure.  Food attracts animals. By storing food properly (hanging it from a tree or using a bear-resistant container), you significantly reduce the likelihood of attracting animals and, therefore, being attacked.

Let's look at why the other options are less effective:

* **A (Go rwala mešunkwane ya go nkga bose - Make noise to scare away animals):** Making noise *can* help, but it's not a guaranteed solution.  Some animals are less easily scared by noise.  It's a supplementary measure, not the primary one.
* **C (Go ba monabo wa diyate tše 25 kgole le diphiri - Be a master of 25 kg of meat and berries):**  This is completely irrelevant.  It doesn't affect animal behavior or safety.
* **D (Go thibela diphoofolo ka marathana a dijo - Prevent animals from following food trails):** While related to option B, this is not the best answer.  Preventing trails is achieved *by* properly storing food (option B).  This option is too vague.



Therefore, hanging food is the most direct and effective way to reduce the risk of animal attacks.



"
Ke sefe sa dilo tše di latelago seo se sa bolelwago karolong ye seo go ka diregago gore ke sebaki se segolo sa go hlaselwa ke diphoofolo tša nageng?,"The correct answer is **C: Go fa diphoofolo tša nageng dijo (Feeding the wildlife)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hlokomela, menkgo e goga dibera le diphoofolo tše dingwe tša naga, kafao efoša go rwala goba go apea dijo tša menkgo gape o dule o hlwekišitše kampa.""  This translates to: ""Beware, the camp attracts berries and other wildlife, as they may raid food or feed on the camp and always keep your camp clean.""

The passage emphasizes that *feeding* the animals is a major cause of attacks because it draws them to the camp in search of food. The other options are related to the size and danger of the animals, but the passage points to feeding as the *specific* reason for increased risk.
