"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki pa ta konsidere kòm yon konsèy ki egzat pou jwe akòdeyon avèk siksè?","The correct answer is **A: Pou volim anplis, ogmante fòs ou itilize pou w peze sou touch yo**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Pa bliye li pa nesesè pou frape touch yo avèk anpil fòs pou jwenn yon volim anplis tankou sou pyano."" (Don't forget it's not necessary to strike the keys with great force to get more volume like on a piano.)

Option A directly contradicts this. The passage advises *against* using excessive force.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Pou prezève andirans ou, kenbe nan yon minimòm mouvman ki pa nesesè yo:** This is directly stated in the passage: ""Asurew ke men w pa gen okenn anpechman pandan tou he nòt yo - eseye pa fe mouvman initil avèk dwèt ou. Fason sa, ou fatige mwens posib."" (Make sure your hands are not obstructed while holding notes - try not to make unnecessary movements with your fingers. That way, you will tire less possible.)
* **C: Fè atansyon lè w ap peze nòt yo pandan w ap kenbe men w rilaks:** The passage implies relaxed hands are important for endurance, although it doesn't explicitly say ""relax your hands."" The advice to avoid unnecessary movement suggests a relaxed state.
* **D: Ogmante vitès ou itilize pou opere ponp lan pou w reyalize volim siplemantè:** The passage states that volume is achieved by using the bellows (""ponp lan"") and increasing its speed (""Ogmante vitès ou itilize pou ..."") is a valid method to increase volume.



"
"Lè w ap jwe akòdeyon an, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo k ap ede w ogmante volim lan?","The correct answer is **A: Plis vitès** and **B: Plis fòs**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""pou jwenn yon volim anplis, w ap itilize souflèt avèk plis presyon oswa vitès."" (to get a louder volume, you will use the bellows with more pressure or speed.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: Mwens presyon:** The text says *more* pressure is needed.
* **D: Mwens mouvman dwèt:** The text says to *avoid* unnecessary finger movements to prevent fatigue.

Therefore, both *more speed* and *more force* are ways to increase the volume on an accordion.
"
Poukisa imaj yo sou televizyon an gen rebò ki koupe?,"The correct answer is **B: Dekwa pou imaj la ranpli tout ekran an**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that overscan is done so the image covers the entire screen. This is the primary reason for the cut-off borders.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pou pèmèt sou-tit yo (To allow subtitles):** While subtitles *can* be affected by overscan, it's not the *reason* for overscan itself. Overscan is about the entire image.
* **C: Pou pèmèt yon konvèsyon ki senp nan lòt fòma (To allow a simple conversion to other formats):**  Overscan isn't related to format conversion.
* **D: Pou koupe sou-tit yo ki twò pre anba a (To cut subtitles that are too close to the bottom):** This is a consequence of overscan, not the reason for it.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan pwoblèm ki annapre la yo yon moun ta ka rankontre lè konvèti yon fim mete l nan fòma DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Sou-tit ki koupe an pati (Subtitles that are cut off)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""...if the video has subtitles too close to the background, they will not be completely shown."" This directly addresses the problem of subtitles being cut off, which is a consequence of overscan during DVD conversion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yon imaj ki pa ranpli tout ekran an (An image that doesn't fill the whole screen):** This is a general description of overscan, but the passage focuses on how overscan *affects subtitles*.
* **C: Yon imaj ki ranpli tout ekran an (An image that fills the whole screen):** This is the opposite of the problem. Overscan *causes* the image to *not* fill the screen.
* **D: Koupe rebò yo (Clipped edges):** While the passage mentions clipped edges in general, it specifically ties this to the problem of subtitles being cut off.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the text."
Kikote ki te gen yon ganizon Britanik sitiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The text states: ""Jeneral John Cadwalder pral lanse yon atak divèsyon kont koloni britanik nan **Bordentown**, pou yo bloke tout ranfò yo."" This means a British garrison was located in Bordentown.
"
Siyati kimoun ki parèt sou bouyon ki ekri alamen an?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The text states: ""yon pwojè maniskri ke Prezidan Palman Djonn Hankok ak sekretè a Chal Tonmsonn te ale nan biznis pou enprime Djonn Denlap..."" This directly indicates that John Dunlap was the printer of the manuscript.
"
"Nan kote ki annapre la yo, kikote yon atak Denlap te rive dènye?","The correct answer is **A: Nouyòk**.

The text states: ""Youn nan yo te voye bay George Washington 6 jiyè, ki te fè l li ak twoup li yo nan Nouyòk 9 jiyèt."" This translates to ""One of them was sent to George Washington July 6th, who read it with his troops in New York July 9th.""
"
Kikote twoup Kolonèl Stark yo te sitiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Nan pwent nò, toutolon kloti a**.

The text states: ""Mesye Stark yo te pran pozisyon sou kloti a sou pwent nò pozisyon Kolon an."" (Mr. Stark took position on the fence on the northern point of the Colon's position.) This means his troops were positioned on the northernmost part of the entire fence line.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè gason Stark yo te pwolonje kloti yo a?","The correct answer is **C: Pandan lamare ba**.

The passage states: ""Lè yon mare ba a te louvri yon brèch nan linyè rivyè Mystic lan nan nòdès penisil la, yo te etann yon kloti byen rapid..."" which translates to ""When a low tide opened a breach in the Mystic River line in the northeast peninsula, they quickly extended a palisade...""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki te youn nan epòk ki pi vyolan nan Chin?","The correct answer is **D: Epòk Twa Wayòm yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Peryòd ki pi rekònèt nan tout se peryòd Twa Wayòm ki te dire 60 lane ant Dinasti Han ak Jin. Pandan peryòd sa yo, gè fewòs yo te fèt ant plizyè nòb ki t ap batay pou twòn. Twa wayòm yo te youn nan epòk ki pi sanginè yo nan listwa Lachin ansyèn plizyè moun mouri pandan y ap batay pou okipe pi wo syèj pi gran palè nan Xi’an lan.""

While Xi'an is mentioned as a location of conflict, the *period* of the Three Kingdoms is identified as the most violent era.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki vre konsènan yon koloni lame foumi k ap antre nan yon faz nomad?","The correct answer is **B: Yo gen yon rezèv manje ki ba**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Koloni a kòmanse yo faz nomad lòske manje disponib la diminye a."" (The colony begins a nomad phase when food availability decreases.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo fè nich pandan lannwit:** The passage says they *don't* make nests during the day; they stay in nests during the night.
* **C: Yo fè nich ki chanje apre 17 jou:** While they make temporary nests, the nests change *each day*, not every 17 days.
* **D: Yo mache pandan lajounen:** The passage explicitly states they march at night.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki deklarasyon ki reflete avèk presizyon abitid koloni lame foumi yo pou fè nich pandan faz nomad la?","The correct answer is **C: Yo chanje nich yo chak jou** (They change their nests every day).

The passage states: ""Pandan faz sa a, koloni a fè nich tanporè ke yo chanje chak jou."" (During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that they change every day.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo bati nich yo pandan lannwit** (They build their nests at night): The passage doesn't specify when they build their nests, only that they are temporary.
* **B: Yo mache pandan 17 jou san yo pa fè nich** (They march for 17 days without building a nest): The passage says they make *temporary* nests, implying they don't march without nesting.
* **D: Yo sèvi ak menm nich yo pandan dire faz la** (They use the same nest during the phase): The passage explicitly states they make *temporary* nests, which suggests they don't use the same one for the entire phase.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo k ap kontinye malgre prezans siyal ekstèn yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Revèy byolojik (Biological rhythms)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Revey biyologik yo se osiyatè  soutyen kap pouswiv yon peryòd siklism lib menm si endis ekstèn yo absan."" This translates to ""Biological rhythms are oscillators that maintain a free cycle period even if external cues are absent.""  This directly addresses the question of what continues despite external signals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sik andojèn (Endogenous cycles):** While related, endogenous cycles *are* a type of biological rhythm. The passage focuses on the *rhythm* itself.
* **B: Ritm peryodik (Periodic rhythms):** This is a general term that *includes* biological rhythms, but it doesn't specifically highlight the ability to continue *without* external cues.
* **D: Ritm ki obsève yo (Observed rhythms):** These are rhythms that we can see, but the passage emphasizes rhythms that function independently of external observations.



Therefore, **Biological rhythms** best captures the concept described in the passage – the ability to maintain a cycle even when external signals are not present.
"
Ki tèm ki dekri moun ki montre divèjans nan yon sèten karakteristik fenotip?,"The correct answer is **D: Polimòfik**.

Here's why:

* **Polimòfik** means having multiple forms or variations. The definition provided states that when individuals within a population show multiple variations of a particular characteristic, they are considered polymorphic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomòfik** means having only one form. This is the opposite of what the question asks.
* **Òganis yo** (Organisms) is too general. It doesn't describe the variation within a population.
* **Espès yo** (Species) refers to a group of organisms that can interbreed. It's not about variation within a population.



"
Kilès nan tèm ki annapre la yo ki kòrèk pou òganis ki okipe yon zòn espesyalman?,"The correct answer is **B: Popilasyon**.

Here's why:

* **Popilasyon:** The definition provided states a population is a collection of organisms of a specific species within a specific geographic area. This directly matches the question about organisms occupying a special zone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:** This refers to a population where all individuals have the same phenotype (physical characteristics). The question doesn't state that all individuals are the same.
* **Species:** A species is a group of organisms capable of interbreeding. While the population is *of* a species, the question asks for the term describing the group *occupying* a zone.
* **Polymorphic:** This refers to a population where individuals have different phenotypes.  The question doesn't state that individuals have different phenotypes; it simply says they are occupying a specific zone.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa ta yon egzanp aktivite touris ki baze sou lanati?,"The correct answer is **C: Vizite yon mize syans**.

Here's why:

* **Nature-based tourism** focuses on experiencing natural environments. 
* **A museum of science** is primarily an indoor institution focusing on scientific concepts, not direct engagement with nature.

The other options are all examples of nature-based tourism:

* **A: Lamach long apye pou ale nan yon kaskad** - Hiking to a waterfall is directly experiencing a natural feature.
* **B: Fè foto flè sovaj yo** - Photographing wildflowers is observing and appreciating nature.
* **D: Fè lapèch ak mouch** - Fishing and birdwatching are direct interactions with wildlife and natural ecosystems.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki se baz sistèm transpò a?","The correct answer is **B: Machin prive**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Chak maten, moun yo kite ti vil nan kanpay yo ak machin pou yo ale nan espas travay yo..."" This directly links the use of private vehicles to the system of transportation described.  The rest of the passage discusses the consequences of this system, not what *makes up* the system itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anplasman travay (Workplaces):** While workplaces are destinations in the transportation system, they are not the *basis* of the system.
*   **C: Yon byosfè stab (A stable biosphere):** The passage says economic carbon emissions are *damaging* the biosphere, not that a stable biosphere is the basis of the transportation system.
*   **D: Evolisyon moun (Human evolution):**  Human evolution is mentioned as a historical context, but it's not the foundation of the current transportation system.



"
Ki tip chaj patikil yo ki òbite nwayo a genyen?,"The correct answer is **C: Chaj negatif**.

The text states: ""Elektwon yo gen yon chaj elektrik negatif."" (Electrons have a negative electric charge.)
"
Ki patikil ki konpoze nwayo a?,"The correct answer is **A: Pwoton ak netwon**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nwayo a fòme ak de patikil - netwon yo ak pwoton yo."" (The nucleus is formed by two particles - neutrons and protons.)
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki se yon egzanp nonb binè senk bit yo?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **Binary numbers** are composed of only 0s and 1s.
* **A 5-bit binary number** means it has exactly 5 digits (bits).

Let's examine the options:

* **A: 1010** - This is a 4-bit binary number.
* **B: 12001** - This includes the digit '2', which is not a valid binary digit.
* **C: 10010** - This is a 5-bit binary number.
* **D: 110101** - This is a 6-bit binary number.

Therefore, only option C fits the description of a 5-bit binary number."
Kijan yo rele chif binè yo tou?,"The correct answer is **A: Bit**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yon chif binè ka sèlman genyen de valè, sa vle di 0 oswa 1, e yo rele chif sa yo chif binè - **ou bit**, pou nou itilize jagon enfòmatik la.""  This directly links binary digits to the term ""bit"".
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa mansyone nan pasaj la kòm yon avantaj prensipal nan blòg elèv yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Yon diminisyon kritik nan men kamarad yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the presence of a general audience *changes* students' writing because they are often very critical of their own work and anticipate criticism. This implies that the audience isn't necessarily supportive or diminishing criticism.
* The passage *does* mention an improvement in grammar and writing ability, a broader awareness of the environment, and an increased desire to continue learning.



Therefore, a decrease in critical feedback from peers is not mentioned as a benefit of blogging in the provided text."
Kilès nan aspè ki annapre la yo nan blòg yo ki site kòm yon motivasyon pou elèv yo amelyore konpetans yo nan ekriti?,"The correct answer is **B: Gwo anvi pou evite kritik**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tankou etidyan yo souvan piblik ki pi kritik la, otè blòg la kòmanse ak fòse amelyore ekriti l pou evite kritik yo."" (Just as students are often the most critical audience, the blog author is forced to improve their writing to avoid criticism.) This directly links the fear of criticism to the motivation for improving writing skills.

While the other options are mentioned as benefits of blogging, they aren't presented as the *primary* motivation for students to improve their writing in the provided text.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa yon avantaj kominikasyon asenkwòn pou elèv yo? ,"The correct answer is **B: Aksè fas a fas ak enstriktè yo nenpòt ki lè nan jounen an.**

Here's why:

* **Asynchronous communication** is characterized by a delay in response. It doesn't involve real-time interaction. 
* Option B directly contradicts the nature of asynchronous communication. It describes immediate, face-to-face access, which is a feature of synchronous communication (like a live meeting or instant messaging).

Let's look at why the other options *are* advantages of asynchronous communication:

* **A: Itilizasyon Entènèt kòm yon resous:**  The internet is a key tool for asynchronous learning, providing access to information at any time.
* **C: Orè travay fleksib:**  Asynchronous learning allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule.
* **D: Kontwòl vitès:** Students can control the speed at which they learn by reviewing materials as many times as needed.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan aspè annapre la yo nan kominikasyon asenkwòn ki pa fleksib pou elèv yo?","The correct answer is **A: Vitès aprantisaj**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that asynchronous learning *favors* reflection and reaction and allows students to work at their *own pace*. This directly addresses the speed of learning, indicating it's flexible in that regard.

The passage also highlights the flexibility of work hours and access to information through the internet.  Therefore, those options are incorrect. The passage doesn't indicate any inflexibility in the *materials* used (the educational materials are accessible).

The question asks what aspect is *not* flexible. Since the passage emphasizes flexibility in reflection, reaction, and pace, the speed of learning (vitès aprantisaj) is the aspect that isn't highlighted as being inflexible.



"
Kisa ki pa mansyone nan pasaj la kòm yon bagay yon moun ta ka asosye ak chato medyeval yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Pi donjon yo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions that people imagined the sounds and smells of battles, knights, and castles. It also says people felt fear in dungeons. While the passage *does* mention dungeons, it's the only element listed that isn't directly linked to the initial inspiration of the imagination mentioned at the beginning of the passage. The passage says fear could be felt *in* dungeons. The other options (battles, knights, castles) are all directly stated as sources of the imagination.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa mansyone nan pasaj la kòm yon odè oswa yon son ki ka evoke nan pami mazi chato yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Laperèz (Silence)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions ""bri ak odè batay lwen yo,"" ""klakman sabo yo sou wout yo,"" and ""pè monte pi donjon.""  These are all sensory details associated with the medieval atmosphere.

The question asks which *isn't* mentioned.  Silence (laperèz) is the opposite of the sensory experiences the passage describes. 

Therefore, **laperèz** is the correct answer.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki se yon deskripsyon egzat Chato Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **D: Li te bati pou reziste ak atak long ak detèmine**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Machwè long li a gen plis ke 70 dan file ak yon dispozitif anpliski nan tèt li menm jan ak yon razwa, yon fason pou tout sa ki kwaze chemenl pa chape."" This describes a structure built for defense and resisting attacks.
* **Option D** directly reflects this description by stating the castle was built to resist prolonged and determined attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Se Lord Hastings ki te mande miray epè yo nan chato a** - While Lord Hastings initiated the construction, the text doesn't state he specifically requested the thick walls. It focuses on the defensive features.
* **B: Chato a te nesesite fòtifikasyon minim akòz nati pezib peyi a nan moman konstriksyon an** - This is the opposite of what the text describes. The elaborate defenses imply a need for significant fortification.
* **C: Konstriksyon chato a pa te òdinè pou peryòd tan an** -  The text presents the castle as unusual and heavily fortified for its time, so this statement is incorrect.



"
Kilès nan karakteristik konstriksyon ki annapre la yo ki ta konsidere kòm yon bagay ki pa òdinè pou Chato Kirby Muxloe a pandan peryòd tan ki dekri nan pasaj la?,"The correct answer is **A: Gwo kokennchenn fenèt yo (Large arrow slits)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Kirby Muxloe Castle has ""more than 70 teeth-like arrow slits"" and a ""razor-like spike device"" on top. This highlights its heavily fortified nature.
*   The passage also mentions the castle was built in a time of relative peace when only minor raids were a concern. 
*   Therefore, *large arrow slits* would be an **unusual** and excessive feature for a castle built during a period of low threat.  Arrow slits were common, but 70 of them, plus a spike device, would suggest a much greater need for defense than the era presented.
*   Options B, C, and D are not contradictory to the passage. The castle *was* fortified. The mention of only minor raids doesn't negate the fact that fortifications were still built. The passage doesn't indicate unusually *few* fortifications or unusually *thin* arrow slits.

So, large arrow slits are the oddity given the context.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki ta pi benefik pou yon kourè k ap prepare pou sezon k ap vini an?","The correct answer is **D: Itilize djim pou fè egzèsis pati anwo kò.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Yon ti kous fon pandan ivè a, konbine ak yon travay jimnastik pou pati siperyè kò a, se pi bon preparasyon pou sezon kous lan.""  This translates to: ""A short, intense run during winter, combined with gymnastic work for the upper body, is the best preparation for the racing season.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pratike kous sou teren varye nan sezon dete (Practice running on varied terrain in the summer):** While varied terrain *can* be beneficial, the passage specifically highlights winter training and upper body strength.  It doesn't emphasize summer terrain.
* **B: Konsantre sou devlope vitès pandan antrènman (Focus on developing speed during training):** The passage states that while speed is helpful, endurance is *more* important now. It also says a fast runner needs to *cultivate* endurance, not solely focus on speed.
* **C: Bat yon tan twa minit (Beat a three-minute time):** The passage mentions that a sub-two-minute mile runner *needs* speed, but doesn't suggest trying to beat a three-minute mile as the best training method.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pi enpòtan pou yon kourè premye klas sou yon demi-mil?","The correct answer is **B: Devlope andirans olye vitès (Develop endurance instead of speed)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Avèk chanjman pou soti nan ka ale nan kous demi-mile lan, vitès la vin mwens enpòtan anpil epi **andirans vin yon gwo nesesite**."" (With the change from being able to go to the half-mile race, speed becomes much less important and **endurance becomes a great necessity**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pratike kous sou teren varye pandan mwa ivè yo (Practice running on varied terrain during the winter months):** While the passage *mentions* winter training (""Un petit cours fon pendant l'hiver""), it doesn't say it's the *most* important thing. It's presented as part of the overall preparation.
* **C: Rive nan mwens pase de minit (Reach under two minutes):**  The passage acknowledges that a top half-mile runner *needs* speed, but emphasizes that it's not the primary focus. It says they ""dwe posede yon bon dòz vitès, men li dwe kiltive andirans ak tout ris yo."" (must possess a good dose of speed, but they must cultivate endurance and all its risks.)
* **D: Devlope vitès olye andirans (Develop speed instead of endurance):** This is the opposite of what the passage advocates.



"
"Pou yon atlèt, kilès nan bagay ki annapre la yo pa ka reyalize sèlman pa mwayen pratik nitrisyonèl?","The correct answer is **C: Pèfòmans elit**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bon pratik alimantè alimantè pa kapab sèl yo menm pwodui pèfòmans elit yo...""  This directly translates to ""Good nutritional practices alone cannot produce elite performance...""

* **The passage suggests:**  ""...yo kapab gen yon enpak enpòtan sou byennèt jeneral jèn atlèt yo."" This means good nutrition *contributes* to overall well-being but isn't the sole factor for elite performance.

* **Other options:**
    * **Rannman amelyore (Improved stamina):** The passage suggests good nutrition can help.
    * **Ogmantasyon plezi (Increased enjoyment):**  The passage explicitly states it can increase enjoyment.
    * **Byennèt jeneral (General well-being):** The passage states it can have a significant impact.



Therefore, elite performance requires more than just nutrition; it likely involves training, genetics, and other factors.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa sijere kòm yon fason pou jèn atlèt jwenn plis plezi nan espò yo a?","The correct answer is **B: Toujou pèfòme nan yon nivo elit** (Always perform at an elite level).

Here's why:

The passage states that while good nutrition and hydration are important for overall well-being and can help improve performance, the passage acknowledges that *even with the best practices, athletes may not be able to achieve elite performance*.  Option B directly contradicts this acknowledged reality. The passage suggests focusing on well-being and enjoyment, not solely on achieving an elite level.  The other options (A, C, and D) are all mentioned as ways to help athletes improve their well-being and enjoy the sport.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, poukisa yon kourè distans mwayen ta ka achte yon pyès ekipman ki pi chè?","The correct answer is **A: Se preferans pèsonèl li** (It's their personal preference).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Athletes may *think* they like a product even when it doesn't provide a real advantage."" This implies that athletes can be swayed by marketing, trends, or simply liking the *idea* of a product, not necessarily its performance benefits.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""many bad ideas concerning some of the equipment... most will have a little or no impact or no real impact on their performance."" This reinforces the idea that expensive equipment doesn't always translate to better performance.

Therefore, a middle-distance runner might buy a more expensive piece of equipment based on personal preference, even if it lacks real performance benefits.  The passage doesn't suggest any of the other options are accurate.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa kous distans mwayen mande?","The correct answer is **C: Tikras ekipman toupiti (a little bit of equipment)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pwodwi yo kapab achte selon bezwen yo, men majorite a pral gen yon ti kras enpak oswa pa gen enpak reyèl sou pèfòmans yo."" This means that while equipment *is* purchased, most of it has minimal or no impact on performance.  Therefore, the distance running sport doesn't necessarily require *a lot* of equipment, only a *little bit*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Anpil ekipman (A lot of equipment):** The passage says most equipment is unnecessary.
* **B: Yon eksperyans atletik etabli (An established athletic experience):** The passage doesn't mention the need for a pre-existing athletic experience.
* **D: Anpil lajan (A lot of money):** The passage mentions that some equipment is expensive, but doesn't say the sport *overall* requires a lot of money. It focuses on unnecessary expenditure.



"
Kimoun ki te dekouvri rezonans mayetik nikleyè? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch ak Purcell**.

The text states: ""MRI chita sou on fenomèm fizik rezonans manyetik (NMR), ke Felix Bloch nan lane 1930 te dekouvri (travay nan inivèsite Stànfòd) ak Edwa Pisèl (ki sòti nan Inivèsite Avad).""  This directly credits both Bloch and Purcell with the discovery of NMR. While Damadian later pioneered its use in medical imaging, the initial discovery of the phenomenon itself was by Bloch and Purcell.
"
Nan ki ane yo te akòde premye patant pou rezonans imajri medikal la? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Kat lane aprè, yon sètifika de delivre, sa ki konstitye premye sètifika nan mond lan nan domèn IRM.""  And it also says, ""Nan lane 1977, Dr Damadian te fini kontriksyon premye eskanè IRM “tout kò” ki te rele ki paka donte."" This implies the patent/certification happened before 1977.

Therefore, the patent was granted in **1974**.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, apwopo kisa moun ta dwe gen yon konpreyansyon solid pou yo entèprete aksyon fizik lòt moun?","The correct answer is **B: Entansyon**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Konprann entansyon lòt yo enpòtan anpil. Li pèmèt nou rezoud tout dout ki te ka genyen sou aksyon fizik yo."" (Understanding the intentions of others is very important. It allows us to resolve all doubts about physical actions.)

The passage uses the example of someone smashing a car to illustrate how understanding intentions is crucial for interpreting actions. Therefore, the passage emphasizes the importance of understanding intentions to interpret the actions of others.

"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa konpreyansyon entansyon ede moun fè?","The correct answer is **A: Elimine ensètitid ki dèyè aksyon fizik yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Li pèmèt nou rezoud tout dout ki te ka genyen sou aksyon fizik yo."" which translates to ""It allows us to resolve all doubts that may exist about physical actions.""  This directly aligns with option A.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Predi dezi yo (Predict desires):** While understanding intentions *can* help predict desires, the passage focuses specifically on resolving doubts about actions.
* **C: Gade lòt moun san pote jijman (Look at other people without judgment):** The passage doesn't mention judgment.  It's about understanding *why* someone did something.
* **D: Li lespri lòt moun (Read minds):** The passage describes a sophisticated form of empathy and inference, not mind-reading.

"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki se yon rezime egzat sou objektif prensipal AI an?","The correct answer is **D: Rann travay otomatik (Automate work)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rechèch nan EA konsène fabrikasyon machin pou otomatize travay ki egzije yon konpòtman entèlijan."" This directly translates to research in AI concerns the manufacturing of machines to automate work that requires intelligent behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Planifikasyon (Planning):** While planning is *an aspect* of what AI can do (mentioned in the passage), it's not the overarching *objective*.
*   **B: Rekonesans vokal (Voice recognition):** Voice recognition is *an example* of a capability AI can have, not the primary objective.
*   **C: Fikse kalandriye (Setting schedules):** Setting schedules is a specific task that AI *could* automate, but again, not the main goal.

Therefore, automating work is the most accurate summary of AI's main objective according to the provided text."
"Dapre pasaj la, ak kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo AI souvan asosye?","The correct answer is **C: Syans fiksyon**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kwake IA gen yon gwo konotasyon ki fò ak **syans fiksyon**..."" (Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction...).  While AI is used in many applications (like customer service and diagnostics), the passage highlights its strong association with science fiction first.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki se yon fòs yon moun modèl panse konvèjan genyen?","The correct answer is **D: Memorize modèl yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Moun yo ki gen tip panse sa gen yon panse lojik, yo kapab memorize modèl yo..."" (People who have this type of thinking have logical thinking, they can memorize models...).  This directly links the ability to memorize models to convergent thinking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Idantifye plizyè repons kòrèk pou yon pwoblèm** (Identify multiple correct solutions to a problem): This is characteristic of **divergent** thinking, not convergent thinking. Convergent thinking aims for *one* correct answer.
* **B: Aplike nouvo teknik pou yon pwoblèm** (Apply new techniques to a problem): This also leans towards **divergent** thinking, as it involves exploring new and varied approaches.
* **C: Pran tan yo pou rezoud pwoblèm** (Take time to solve a problem):  While convergent thinkers might *work hard* to find the answer, the passage emphasizes *speed, logic, and precision*.  Taking a long time isn't necessarily a defining characteristic.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa konsidere kòm yon objektif nan mantalite panse konvèjan?","The correct answer is **B: Yon moun pran tan l** (A person takes their time).

Here's why:

The passage describes convergent thinking as focused on speed, logic, and precision, aiming for *one* correct answer.  Option B, ""A person takes their time,"" contradicts the emphasis on speed and efficiency inherent in convergent thinking. The other options align with convergent thinking:

* **A: Konprann ke gen yon sèl repons kòrèk** - This is a core characteristic of convergent thinking.
* **C: Idantifye reyalite yo** -  This is a necessary step in analyzing a problem to find a solution, aligning with the logical approach of convergent thinking.
* **D: Rasanble enfòmasyon** -  Gathering information is crucial for solving problems, and convergent thinking uses information to arrive at a specific answer.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa ta konsidere kòm yon mikwo-ekspresyon?","The correct answer is **D: Bay yon gwo pous anlè (Giving a big thumbs up)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *micro* expressions:** The core of the passage is about very brief, subtle facial expressions (lasting milliseconds). 
* **The other options are examples of micro-expressions:**
    * **Fè koudèy yon lòt kote pandan w ap pale (Looking away while speaking):** This is a fleeting nonverbal cue that can indicate discomfort or deception.
    * **Fwonse sousi (Furrowing the brow):**  A subtle expression of concern, worry, or concentration.
    * **Bat je rapidman (Blinking rapidly):**  Can be a sign of stress or deception.
* **Giving a big thumbs up** is a relatively broad and deliberate gesture, not a quick, involuntary facial expression.  It's a clear signal of approval and doesn't fit the definition of a micro-expression.



"
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo konsènan entèpretasyon mikwo-ekspresyon ki pa vre?,"The incorrect statement is **C: Yo entèprete lapawòl ni ekspresyon vizaj tou (They interpret words or facial expressions too).**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the focus is on **micro-expressions and facial *movements* that last milliseconds**, not on interpreting words themselves. While micro-expressions *can* relate to what someone is saying, the passage doesn't claim direct interpretation of spoken language.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Anrejistreman videyo yo te mennen nan pwogrè enpòtan (The video recordings led to important progress):** This is directly stated in the first sentence.
*   **B: Entèpretasyon kòrèk ka detekte manti (Correct interpretation can detect lies):** The passage suggests this possibility (""yo pretann yo ka wè si yon moun ap bay manti lè yo fè entèpretasyon mikwo ekspresyon yo korèkteman"").
*   **D: Li ka ede evalye senserite (It can help evaluate sincerity):** This is a direct consequence of the ability to detect lies and the overall goal of the research.

Therefore, C is the only statement that isn't supported by the passage.

**Final Answer: C**"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki te vin pi enpòtan kòm rezilta Renesans lan? ,"The correct answer is **C: Rapèl tèks (Textual recall)**.

The passage states: ""Presyon pa t 'rete nan rapèl endividyèlselman, men kapasite nan sonje tèks te vin pi plis nan yon preokipasyon.""  This directly indicates that the ability to remember text became more important during the Renaissance.
"
"Kòm rezilta Renesans lan, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ke yo te mete mwens aksan sou li?","The correct answer is **A: Rapèl endividyèl**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Presyon pa t 'rete nan rapèl endividyèlselman, men kapasite nan sonje tèks te vin pi plis nan yon preokipasyon."" This directly indicates that individual recall became less emphasized during the Renaissance. The focus shifted towards preserving and transmitting knowledge through textual means.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jwenn konesans:** The passage says that the *capacity* to gain knowledge changed, not the act of gaining knowledge itself.
* **C: Rapèl tèks:** The passage explicitly states that the ability to remember texts became *more* of a concern.
* **D: Distribisyon enfòmasyon:** While the Renaissance did change information distribution, the passage doesn't say it was emphasized *less*, just that individual recall was de-emphasized.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa reflete yon motivasyon pou itilize Entènèt pou kontinye ak relasyon?,"The correct answer is **C: Fè rechèch pou vwayaj**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the option that *doesn't* reflect a motivation for continued connections and relationships.**  The passage explicitly mentions ""relasyon kontini"" (continued relationships) as a motivation for using the internet.
* **Fè rechèch pou vwayaj (Doing research for travel)** primarily focuses on a practical, goal-oriented task. While it *could* indirectly lead to connecting with others (e.g., finding travel buddies), the core motivation isn't inherently about maintaining existing relationships or forming new ones.
* **The other options directly align with the passage's themes:**
    * **Kreye rezo biznis (Creating business networks):**  Often involves building and maintaining professional relationships.
    * **Rete an kontak avèk fanmi (Staying in touch with family):** Directly related to maintaining existing relationships.
    * **Fè rankont nouvo moun (Meeting new people):** Directly related to forming new relationships.



Therefore, research for travel is the least directly connected to the core concepts of continued relationships and social connections emphasized in the passage."
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa reflete yon motivasyon pou itilize Entènèt pou enplike w pèsonèlman?,"The correct answer is **C: Fè rechèch sou pwodui pou swen sante yo**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states that ""Enplikasyon pèsonèl"" (personal involvement) is a key motivator for internet use.**  This means people use the internet to connect with others, express themselves, and build relationships.

Let's look at the options:

* **A: Fè rechèch yon resèt (Searching for a recipe):**  While this might be done alone, it doesn't inherently involve personal connection or social interaction. It's primarily task-oriented.
* **B: Poste nan yon fowòm diskisyon sou Entènèt (Posting on an online discussion forum):** This is a direct form of personal involvement, as it involves interacting with others, sharing thoughts, and building a sense of community.
* **C: Fè rechèch sou pwodui pou swen sante yo (Researching health products):** This is primarily an informational task. It doesn't necessarily involve personal connection or social interaction.
* **D: Jere finans (Managing finances):**  This can be done alone and doesn't inherently involve personal connection or social interaction, although it can be a motivator for some individuals to seek financial advice online.

Therefore, researching health products is the least likely to be motivated by a desire for personal involvement in the way the prompt describes.



"
Kilè Ewòp delwès te sispann konte anpil sou enfliyans epi yo te kòmanse devlope pwòp estil pa yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ozalantou fen Mwayennaj**.

The passage states: ""Lè Mwayennaj la te pral fini, Ewòp oksidantal te kòmanse devlope pwòp estil li."" (When the Middle Ages were ending, Western Europe began to develop its own style.)
"
Rezilta kisa itilizasyon bouton pou tache rad te ye? ,"The correct answer is **C: Kwazad yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Youn nan pi gwo devlopman nan epòk la, kòm konsekans kwazad yo, moun yo te kòmanse itilize bouton pou tache rad yo."" (One of the biggest developments of the era, as a consequence of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their robes.)

Therefore, the introduction of buttons for fastening robes was a direct result of the Crusades.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ke yo konsidere kòm yon solisyon solid alontèm pou pwoblèm anviwònman an?","The correct answer is **C: Idantifye kòz pwoblèm yo** (Identify the root causes of the problem).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Si nou pa vle sèlman yon solisyon tanporè, nou dwe **jwenn rasin pwoblèm yo epi dezaktive yo**."" (If we don't want only a temporary solution, we must find the root causes of the problem and deactivate them).
* While the other options might be *part* of a solution, they aren't the core long-term answer the passage emphasizes. 
    * **A: Bòykote chwa mòdvi ekstravagan yo** (Boycott extravagant lifestyles) is an action *resulting* from understanding the root causes.
    * **B: Aktivism** (Activism) is a method of *addressing* the problem but not identifying the underlying causes.
    * **D: Vin yon alye nan mouvman anviwònmantal la** (Becoming an ally in the environmental movement) is a broader action that encompasses various approaches, including identifying root causes.

Therefore, identifying the root causes is presented as the fundamental step toward a lasting solution.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan solisyon ki annapre la yo ki pa ta konsidere kòm yon tretman pou sentòm pwoblèm anviwònmantal yo?","The correct answer is **B: Dezaktive kòz alabaz pwoblèm yo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that simply addressing symptoms is not enough. It emphasizes the need to find and *eliminate the root causes* of the environmental problems.  

* **A: Angaje nan aktivism** (Engaging in activism) is mentioned as a way to rejoin the environmental movement and potentially reduce future suffering. While activism can be a symptom-level response, it's also part of addressing the root causes by raising awareness and pushing for change.
* **C: Eksprime opinyon sou chwa mòdvi ekstravagan yo** (Expressing opinions on extravagant lifestyle choices) is a form of raising awareness and can be part of influencing behavior change. It can contribute to addressing the root causes.
* **D: Viv nan yon fason ki pi adapte ak anviwònman an** (Living in a more environmentally friendly way) is also a way to lessen the symptoms of environmental degradation.

However, **B: Dezaktive kòz alabaz pwoblèm yo** (Eliminating the root causes of the problem) is the *only* option that describes a solution to the *root* of the problem, not just a symptom. The passage argues that this is what's needed, and the other options are more focused on mitigating the effects.



"
Nan ki peyi ki premye lagè ann Ewòp la te dewoule kote yo di pwoblèm santral la te gen rapò ak ekilib pouvwa olye li te gen yon kontèks relijye?,"The correct answer is **D: Espay**.

The question asks which country was the first to experience a war in Europe where the central issue was balance of power rather than a religious context. The passage states that the War of the Spanish Succession was the first war where the central issue was balance of power, and it marked a change from previous wars.  The passage also directly mentions the War of the Spanish Succession as an example.
"
Ki lagè yo dekri pafwa kòm dènye ‘gè relijye’ a?,"The correct answer is **A: Gè Trantan an**.

The text explicitly states: ""E lagè Trant An a pral dènye gè ki kalifye gè relijyon."" (And the Thirty Years' War will be the last war that qualifies as a religious war.)



"
Kilès nan aspè ki annapre la yo nan Legliz Katolik yo pa te egzamine?,"The correct answer is **A: Si repatisyon richès andedan Legliz la te apwopriye**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Church's wealth was intended to alleviate suffering and poverty. It then raises the question of whether this principle was respected. Option A directly addresses this concern by asking if the distribution of wealth within the Church was misappropriated.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Si prensip prensipal yo nan relijyon an ta dwe modifye:** While the passage questions whether principles were respected, it doesn't directly ask if the principles themselves should be changed. It focuses on the application of the principles.
* **C: Konsantrasyon pouvwa andedan Legliz la:** The passage mentions the concentration of power as a factor contributing to questions about whether principles were respected, but it doesn't frame it as something that wasn't examined.
* **D: Si yo te respekte prensip prensipal yo nan Legliz la:** This is essentially a restatement of the central question being asked in the passage.

Therefore, option A is the most direct and accurate reflection of a key aspect of the Church's past that the passage implies was being examined."
"Dapre pasaj la, ki moun yo te asasinen nan Versailles?","The correct answer is **A: Yon nan fanm nan mache a**

The text states: ""Yon foul fanm ki t ap vann nan mache te fòse..."" which translates to ""A crowd of women who were selling in the market forced..."" and then goes on to describe the events.  The passage explicitly says a woman from the market was present and part of the crowd that forced the royal family to return to Paris. The text also mentions someone in the crowd shaking their head at a royal guard *in front of the Queen*. This implies the guard was killed by someone in the crowd, but it doesn't name who. However, the question asks *who* was assassinated at Versailles according to the passage. The passage directly states a woman from the market was present.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo popilas la pa te fòse Wa ak Rèn lan fè?,"The correct answer is **B: Yon sòti bridsoukou nan Versailles (A hasty exit from Versailles)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** The King, Queen, Marie Thérèse, Louis-Charles, and Elizabeth were *forced* to leave Versailles by the crowd.
* **Option B says:** A *hasty* exit. This implies they didn't choose to leave; they were compelled to.
* **Options A, C, and D are all actions directly resulting from the crowd forcing them:**
    * **A: Ouvèti fenèt kawòs yo a (Opening the carriage windows):** The crowd demanded this.
    * **C: Yon vizyon gad y ap koupe tèt li a (Seeing a guard commit suicide):** This was a terrifying act perpetrated *by* the crowd, intended to intimidate the royal family.
    * **D: Yon vwayaj pou retounen nan Pari (A journey back to Paris):** This was the destination the crowd forced them to travel to.

Therefore, the only option where the royal family wasn't forced to act is a hasty exit, as it was a result of the circumstances imposed upon them.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa te yon rezilta gè naval Grann Bretay ki pa konvansyonèl la?,"The correct answer is **C: Chanjman yo te fè nan dwa entènasyonal la**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the blockade violated established international law.** The passage emphasizes that the blockade *violated* existing international laws. It doesn't say the blockade *caused* changes to those laws.
* **A, B, and D are all direct consequences of the blockade.** The blockade directly led to Germany wanting to retaliate with similar naval tactics (A), endangering neutral ships (B), and cutting off vital supplies (D).
* **C is an external factor.**  Changes in international law are a broader, long-term process and aren't a direct, immediate result of this particular British naval blockade. The blockade was a violation *of* existing law, not a catalyst *for* its change.



"
Ki deklarasyon ki pa dekri avèk presizyon blokaj naval Grann Bretay la kont Almay?,"The correct answer is **D: Li te asire ke bato net yo pa t ap an danje** (It ensured that neutral ships were not in danger).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the blockade *put even neutral ships in danger* (""Tankou reyaksyon ak taktik sa te limite, Almay te atann li ak yon reyaksyon parèy ak lagè sou marin li an ki san restriksyon."").  This directly contradicts option D.
* Options A, B, and C are all supported by the passage. The blockade *did* violate international law, *did* provoke unrestricted German submarine warfare, and *did* cut off supplies to Germany.



Therefore, the statement that the blockade *ensured* the safety of neutral ships is inaccurate based on the information provided."
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès ki ta trè pwobableman gen yon dyagnostik Esklewoz Miltip?","The correct answer is **A: Yon fi laj 32 lane**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that women are twice as likely to get MS than men.
* A 32-year-old woman falls within the age range where MS is commonly diagnosed (young adults to older adults).
* The other options, a 15-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl, are younger than the typical onset age for MS. While MS *can* occur at younger ages, it's less common.
* A 43-year-old man is possible, but the passage specifically highlights the increased risk for women.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, pou ki bagay patisipan nan aktivite regilye yo te bezwen plis sipò?","The correct answer is **A: Pèsepsyon negatif doulè (Negative pain perception)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sa yo ki patisipe nan yon aktivite regilye gen bezwen plis sipò an tèm pèsepsyon negatif ak doulè..."" which translates to ""Those who participate in regular activity need more support in terms of negative pain perception...""

While depression and fear are mentioned as mediators, the passage says they were *overly exaggerated*. The support needed was for the negative *perception* of pain.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kijan yo konn jwe eskrim òdinèman?","The correct answer is **D: Nan yon fòma dyèl**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Espò sa prensipalman pratike sou fòm dyèl, yon eskrimè ap batay ak yon lòt."" This translates to ""This sport is mainly practiced in a duel form, where a fencer fights another.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki ta endikatè pi solid pou anpwazonnman entèn?","The correct answer is **D: Yon boutèy konprime preskripsyon (A bottle of prescription pills)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Pi bon endikasyon anpwazònman entèn se kapab prezans yon veso medikaman ki louvri oswa pwodwi chimik toksik ki nan kay la."" (The best indication of internal poisoning is the presence of an open medicine container or toxic chemical products in the home.)

The other options (A, B, and C) are symptoms that *could* be associated with poisoning, but the passage explicitly identifies a container of pills or toxic chemicals as the *best* indication.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki premye etap ki apwopriye lè w ap evalye yon viktim?","The correct answer is **A: Obsève sèn lan (Observe the scene)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Pou verifye viktim lan, ou dwe dabò enspekte ozanviwon yo pou asire sekirite w."" (To verify the victim, you must first inspect the surroundings to ensure your safety.) This means the first step is to observe the scene for safety before approaching the victim.
"
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki pa reflete avèk presizyon pwosesis pou verifye yon viktim?,"The correct answer is **A: Pa enkyete w ak sibi pwòp blesi ou yo** (Don't worry about getting injured yourself).

Here's why:

* The statement explicitly says, ""Si ou blese pandan w ap eseye ede, w ap anpire bagay yo"" (If you get injured while trying to help, you will make things worse). This directly contradicts the idea of *not* worrying about your own injuries.  Prioritizing your safety *is* part of a safe response.

The other options *are* reflected in the statement:

* **B: Evalye sèn lan anvan viktim lan** (Assess the scene before the victim) - The statement says to inspect the surroundings for safety.
* **C: Obsève pozisyon viktim lan** (Observe the victim's position) - The statement specifically mentions noting the victim's position.
* **D: Eseye remake nenpòt siy avètisman** (Try to notice any warning signs) - The statement mentions looking for automatic alarm signals.



"
Kilès nan chanjman Revolisyon Fransè a te pwovoke ki te gen yon gwo enpak sou sitwayen klas travayè yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Yon chanjman oryantasyon sot nan klas ale nan konpetans (A shift in orientation from class to competence).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Aprè Revolisyon an, pwofesyon yo te ouvri ak tout kandida gason yo on fason pou pèmèt sak pi pèfòman ak epi pi anbisye yo reyisi. Menm jan an valab menm pou lame paske olye klase lame yo an fonksyon klas yo nou klase yo dezòmè an fonksyon nivo yo."" This highlights a move *away* from social class as the primary determinant of opportunity and *towards* skill and ability.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ogmantasyon sipò pou nasyon an (Increased support for the nation):** While nationalism *did* rise, the passage focuses on the change in *how* people were selected for roles, not just a general increase in national support.
* **C: Yon adopsyon ideoloji Repibliken an (An adoption of Republican ideology):**  The passage mentions the shift to Republicanism, but the core impact on workers was the change in how opportunities were accessed, not just the adoption of a political ideology.
* **D: Yon nouvo sistèm mezi (A new system of measurement):**  The passage mentions a new system of measurement, but again, the main impact was the change in how people were selected, not just the introduction of a new system.



Therefore, the shift from a class-based system to one based on competence is the most significant change impacting the working class mentioned in the passage.



"
"Apre Revolisyon Fransè a, sou kisa siksè nan lame ak nan lòt metye yo te gen mwens tandans baze?","The correct answer is **C: Anbisyon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aprè Revolisyon an, pwofesyon yo te ouvri ak tout kandida gason yo on fason pou pèmèt sak pi pèfòman ak **pi anbisye** yo reyisi."" This directly indicates that ambition was a key factor in success after the French Revolution. The passage also contrasts this with a system based on class or function. While performance is mentioned, ambition is the more direct and emphasized factor.



"
Ki sèvis piblik yo di ki lakòz plis mekontantman nan peyi devlope yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Transpò piblik (Public transportation)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""Prèske tout moun ap plenyen pou sistèm transpò yo"" (Almost everyone is complaining about the transport systems).
* **The prompt contrasts this with developed countries:** ""Nan peyi devlope yo ou pa tande toutan pakèt plenyen sou kalite dlo oubyen pon ki ap tonbe"" (In developed countries, you don't often hear a barrage of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges).
* **The question asks:** ""Poukisa sistèm transpò yo pwovoke anpil plent, poukisa yo echwe toutan?"" (Why do transport systems provoke so many complaints, why do they fail completely?)

Therefore, the question directly points to transport systems as the source of widespread complaints.  While water quality and bridge construction are mentioned as things *not* complained about in developed nations, the prompt explicitly states complaints about transport systems *are* common.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa yo ka di sou sistèm transpò piblik yo?","The correct answer is **C: Yo lakòz moun ki itilize yo fè anpil plent.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Prèske tout moun ap plenyen pou sistèm transpò yo."" (Almost everyone is complaining about the transport systems.)
* The passage also contrasts this with situations like water quality or collapsing bridges, saying that complaints about those are not heard ""toutan"" (all the time) in developed countries.

Therefore, the passage directly links the transport systems to the complaints people have.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tout moun ki itilize yo renmen yo anpil** (Everyone who uses them loves them a lot) - This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **B: Yo pa gen mennm move kalite tankou dlo** (They don't have the same bad quality as water) - While the passage mentions a difference in complaints, it doesn't say the transport systems are of *better* quality.
* **D: Yo gratis nan pifò peyi devlope yo** (They are free in most developed countries) - The passage doesn't mention whether transport systems are free or not.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki kapab difisil pou evalye akòz chofè enprevizib yo?","The correct answer is **D: Flo Trafik la (Traffic Flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Malerezman, li difisil pou etidye mouvman sikilasyon an paske konpòtman chofè yo pa kapab predi avèk san pou san sètitid.""  The passage then goes on to say that *volim sikilasyon an* (circulation volume) can be represented mathematically.  Traffic flow *is* the circulation volume.  Since driver behavior is unpredictable, it's difficult to accurately predict and model traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vitès trafik (Traffic Speed):** While speed can be affected by driver behavior, the passage implies that the *volume* of traffic flow is the primary difficulty in predicting.
* **B: Planifikasyon wout (Road Planning):**  The passage states that understanding traffic flow *helps* with road planning.  It doesn't say that planning is difficult.
* **C: Operasyon wout yo (Road Operations):** Similar to planning, understanding traffic flow aids in road operations, not hinders them.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ke yo itilize lè y ap reprezante yon sikilasyon trafik nan fason matematik?,"The correct answer is **D: Dansite trafik la**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pou byen reprezante volim trafik la, relasyon yo te etabli ant twa prensipal karakteristik: (1) debi an, (2) dansite an, ak (3) vitès la.""  Therefore, density is explicitly listed as one of the key characteristics used to mathematically represent traffic volume.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Operasyon wout yo:** While operations are related to traffic, they aren't a *characteristic* used to directly represent traffic volume mathematically.
* **B: Konpòtman chofè yo:** The passage acknowledges that driver behavior is difficult to predict with certainty.  While important, it's not a directly used characteristic for mathematical representation of traffic volume.
* **C: Konsepsyon wout la:** Road design influences traffic flow, but it's not a characteristic *of* the traffic itself, but a factor that *affects* it.



"
Kisa Hershey ak Chase te itilize pou enplante ADN yo a? ,"The correct answer is **B: Materyèl jenetik**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what Hershey and Chase used to *implant* their genetic material (ADN).
* The passage explicitly states that their experiment was designed to show that **ADN** was the genetic material. They used radioactive labeling to track either the ADN *or* the protein, not a separate material to implant the ADN.
* Options A and C (fosfò radyoaktif and souf radyoaktif) are *labels* used to identify the ADN or protein, not the implanting agent.
* Option D (Viris yo) were used as a *vector* or carrier to deliver the ADN into the bacteria, but the experiment was ultimately about proving ADN as the genetic material, not the bacteria themselves being the implanting agent.



"
De kisa kapasite pou yon transmèt mitasyon bay desandan yo depann?,"The correct answer is **A: Si selil yo se liye jèminal (If the cells are germ cells)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sèlman modifikasyon selil jèminal yo kapab transmèt ak timoun..."" (Only modifications of germ cells can be transmitted to offspring...).  Germ cells (sperm and egg) are involved in reproduction, so changes in these cells are the only ones that can be passed down genetically.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Enpòtans materyèl jenetik (Importance of the genetic material):** While important, the *importance* of the affected genetic material doesn't determine whether a mutation is passed on.
* **C: Tip mitasyon an (Type of mutation):**  The type of mutation (e.g., point mutation, deletion) affects the *effect* of the mutation, but not whether it's passed on.
* **D: Si mitasyon an ka lakòz lanmò selil (Whether the mutation can cause cell death):** Cell death is a potential consequence of a mutation, but doesn't determine if it's heritable.  Mutations in non-germ cells might lead to cell death, but they won't be passed to the next generation.



Therefore, the key factor for heritability is whether the affected cells are germ cells."
"Dapre enfòmasyon yo bay nan pasaj la, sou kisa divès efè mitasyon yo pa konte?","The correct answer is **B: Si selil ki afekte yo se liye jèminal**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the effect of a mutation depends on whether the affected cells are germ cells. Germ cell mutations are the only ones that can be passed on to offspring.  The passage highlights this as a key factor determining the significance of the mutation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ki kantite materyèl jenetik ki afekte:** The passage mentions the *importance* of the affected genetic material, implying that the amount matters, but it's not the *key* differentiating factor in the *different* effects.
*   **C: Enpòtans materyèl jenetik ki afekte a:** The passage states that the importance of the affected genetic material is *one* factor, but not the *sole* factor determining the *different* effects.
*   **D: Tip mitasyon ki afekte a:** The passage directly states that the *type* of mutation is a factor in the different effects. Therefore, this is incorrect.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa te yon rezon ki fè ansyen kilti yo te elve kabrit?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo te ofri konpayi**.

The passage explicitly states that ancient cultures domesticated goats for access to milk, meat, and hides. While goats *can* provide companionship, the passage doesn't mention it as a reason for domestication. The other options (meat, milk, and hides) are all listed as reasons.
"
Objektif gòlf la se pran mwens kantite nan kisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Frap yo (Swings)**.

The passage states: ""Jwè ki pran mwens kou, oswa **swing klèb la**, pou tèmine pakou an ganyan."" This means the goal is to have the fewest swings (or strokes) to complete the course.
"
"Sou yon teren gòlf, kikote zèb la koupe pi kout?","The correct answer is **B: Sou green lan**.

The passage states: ""Jwèt la jwe sou zèb, zèb ozalantou twou an koupe pi kout epi li rele green."" (The game is played on turf, the turf around the hole is cut shorter and is called the green.)"
Ki objektif yon eksperyans òdinèman?,"The correct answer is **A: Pou elimine youn oswa plizyè ipotèz posib**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""eksperimantasyon ak eksperyans se yon tès ki pèmèt nou elimine yonn ou plizyè ipotèz posib..."" (experimentation and experimentation are a test that allows us to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses...)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Pou konprann kijan mond lan fonksyone:** While experiments *contribute* to understanding how the world works, this is a broader goal of science, not the specific objective of a single experiment.
* **C: Pou poze kesyon:**  Experiments often *stem from* questions, but the experiment itself isn't primarily *to* ask the question.
* **D: Pou gide rechèch syantifik:**  Experiments are *part of* guiding scientific research, but their immediate objective is to test specific hypotheses.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki pa ede gide rechèch syantifik la?","The correct answer is **A: Metòd syantifik la poukont li**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Metòd sa **guide majorite rechèch syantifik yo**."" (This method guides most scientific research). It doesn't say the method *itself* is *not* helpful.  It lists other things that *also* help.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fè obsèvasyon** - The passage explicitly states that ""poze kesyon ak fè obsèvasyon ede tou nan rechèch syantifik"" (asking questions and making observations also help in scientific research).
*   **C: Elimine ipotèz ki posib yo** -  The passage mentions ""tès ki pèmèt nou elimine yonn ou plizyè ipotèz posib"" (a test that allows us to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses).
*   **D: Dirije eksperyans yo** - The passage says ""eksperimantasyon ak eksperyans se yon tès"" (experimentation and experience are a test), implying they guide experiments.



Therefore, the only option that doesn't align with the passage is A. The method guides research, but the method *itself* isn't the only thing that helps.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki deklarasyon sou tònad yo ki pa vre?","The correct answer is **C: Pifò tònad yo dire plis pase twazèdtan**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""2 pousan tònad ki pi fò yo dire plis pase twa èdtan."" (2 percent of the strongest tornadoes last longer than three hours.)  This means *most* tornadoes do *not* last longer than three hours.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Tònad yo kapab detwi tout bagay ki nan vwazinaj yo** - The passage says they can destroy *everything* in their path.
* **B: Tònad yo frape zòn ki pi piti pase lòt tanpèt yo** - The passage states they hit a *small area* compared to other severe storms.
* **D: Gen kèk tònad ki ka gen van jiska 300 mph** - The passage explicitly states that the strongest tornadoes have winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).

Therefore, option C is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki dekri avèk presizyon pifò nan tònad yo?","The correct answer is **D: Yo kapab rache pyebwa nan tè a**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tònad yo derasinen pyebwa yo..."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Anjeneral yo dire plis pase twazèdtan:** The passage says ""2 pousan tònad ki pi fò yo dire plis pase twa èdtan,"" not that *all* tornadoes do.
* **B: Yo kreye van ozalantou 480 mph:** The passage says the *winds* in the strongest tornadoes can reach 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph), but it doesn't say the tornadoes *create* those winds.
* **C: Yo afekte pi gwo zòn pase lòt tanpèt yo:** The passage states the tornadoes hit a ""ti zòn"" (small area) compared to other strong storms.

Therefore, option D is the only one accurately described by the passage."
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo lèzòm te kòmanse fè nan 16yèm syèk la?,"The correct answer is **D: Fè teleskòp**.

The passage states: ""Sepandan, premye veritab teleskòp yo te fabrike an Ewòp nan fen 16zyèm syèk la."" This directly answers the question about what people started *making* in the 16th century. While people had been using lenses and magnifying objects for a long time, the 16th century marked the beginning of telescope construction.
"
Depi konbyen tan lèzòm ap agrandi objè avèk èd lantiy yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Depi plizyè milye ane**.

The passage states: ""Lòm fabrike epi itilize lantiy pou agrandisman depi plizyè milye lane."" (Humans have been making and using lenses for magnification for several thousand years.)
"
"Baze sou pasaj la, kisa gwòt Muhammad la di sou pratik espirityèl li oswa valè li yo?","The correct answer is **A: Li bay lapè ak izòlman valè**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the cave was in a remote location, isolated from the world, and offered complete solitude. This directly points to the value of peace and isolation for spiritual practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bri deyò ka ede kontanplasyon:** The passage describes the cave as being devoid of sound (""Nou pa kapab wè epi tande depi anndan gwòt la...""), so this is the opposite of what it suggests.
* **C: Li te bezwen ti tan toupiti poukont li:** The passage doesn't mention a need for short periods of solitude. It emphasizes a deeper, more extended isolation.
* **D: Li te enkyete pou yo ta wè l ak tande l:** The passage states the cave was *difficult* to find, indicating a desire for secrecy and avoiding being seen or heard.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, pou kisa yo te itilize Fè anpremye?","The correct answer is **D: Ray yo**.

The passage states: ""An 1767, premye ray an fè yo te parèt."" (In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.) The passage also mentions that plates of iron were added to wooden wheels to make them more efficient. Therefore, the first use of iron mentioned is for the rails.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, poukisa yo te ranplase wou an bwa yo ak wou an fè?","The correct answer is **D: Fè ki sou ray yo te ize yo**.

Here's why: The passage states, ""Pandan tan saa, yo te vin rann yo kont ray yo ap pi efikas si yo te gen yon plak fè sou yo. Sa te vin yon pratik nòmal, men fè a te lakoz plis pwoblèm sou kawoutchou an bwa wagon yo."" This indicates that the iron plates on the rails were causing problems for the wooden wheels.  Therefore, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels to address this issue. Options A, B, and C are not directly supported by the text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki te fasone moun yo pandan peryòd Womantis la?","The correct answer is **B: Jewografi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nan kontèks romantism, gewografi a fasone moun yo..."" which translates to ""In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people...""
"
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki pa reflete yon lide jeneral sou detèminism teknolojik? ,"The correct answer is **A: Efè teknoloji a sou sosyete a kondisyone sou plan sosyal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly argues *against* option A.** The passage states, ""Pi fò entèpretasyon detèminiz teknolojik pataje de gwo ide: devlopman teknoloji nan li menm swiv yon chimen ki fèl depase enfliyans kiltirè ak politik...teknoloji an retou gen """"efè"""" sou sosyete ki pwòp ak li menm olye ke l kite kondisyone pa soyal lan.""  Option A directly contradicts this by saying the effects of technology are *conditioned* by the social plan.

Let's look at why the other options *do* reflect a general idea of technological determinism:

* **B: Kilti pa enfliyanse devlopman teknoloji a:** This aligns with the passage's claim that technology development follows its own path *beyond* cultural influences.
* **C: Teknoloji a gen efè an limenm sou sosyete a:** This is a core tenet of technological determinism – the idea that technology has an independent and direct impact on society.
* **D: Devlopman teknolojik la pa baze sou enfliyans politik:** This supports the passage's idea that technological development isn't primarily driven by political factors.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa asosye ak rale bow a?","The correct answer is **A: Yon son pi dous**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that an ""achè ki ale anwo"" (upstroke) typically produces a ""ti son dous"" (soft sound). 
* The passage says ""Yon achè desann bay son ki pi fò"" (A downstroke produces a louder sound).
* The passage does mention that ""mak """"up bow"""" la sanble ak yon V"" (the up bow mark looks like a V) and ""mak """"down bow"""" la sanble ak yon agraf oswa yon kare kote manke fas anndan an"" (the down bow mark looks like a clip or a square where the inside face is missing).
* The passage states you start a downstroke ""pa grenouy lan"" (from the knee).



Therefore, a soft sound is associated with the upstroke (not the downstroke).



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki asosye ak son ki pi dou?","The correct answer is **C: Yon mak ki sanble ak yon V**.

The passage states: ""Yon achè ki ale anwo bay yon abityèlman on ti son dous..."" (An up bow typically gives a soft sound...).  ""Mak """"up bow"""" la sanble ak yon V"" (The up bow looks like a V).

Therefore, the up bow (which looks like a V) produces the softer sound.
"
Fosil yo montre ke men yo te fini pa adapte pou yo itilize prensipalman pou kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Manipilasyon**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...zo men fosil yo ansyen de ak twa milyon lane revele chanjman espesyalizasyon men an, ki sòti nan lokomosyon rive nan **manipilasyon**."" This directly indicates that the evolution of the hand shifted from locomotion to manipulation.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki dekri falanj yon chenpanze avèk presizyon? ,"The correct answer is **A: Yo pi dwat pase pa yon moun**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that chimpanzee fingers are ""plis dwèt yo"" (more curved/bent) than human fingers. This directly addresses the shape of the fingers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Men yo ak pye yo diferan nan gwosè:** The passage mentions the length and size of the chimpanzee foot are similar to a human foot, so this is incorrect.
* **C: Yo itilize yo pou sipòte pwa:** While the passage notes chimpanzees use hands for weight-bearing, it doesn't specifically say this applies to the *fingers*. The main point about weight-bearing is about the entire hand structure.
* **D: Yo itilize yo prensipalman pou manipilasyon:** The passage notes the evolution of hands from locomotion to manipulation, but it doesn't state that the fingers are *primarily* used for manipulation in chimpanzees. The entire hand is involved in this process.

Therefore, option A is the only one that directly reflects the description in the passage regarding chimpanzee fingers."
Nan ki rezèvwa seleksyon retire nouvo varyasyon jenetik?,"The correct answer is **D: Eksprime (Expressed)**.

The question states that selection *removes* new genetic variation from the **expressed** pool of variation.  The expressed pool refers to the variations that are actually being observed and acted upon by natural selection.  The hidden (unexpressed) variation is not subject to selection until it becomes expressed.
"
Ki pwosesis ki responsab ajoutman varyasyon jenetik?,"The correct answer is **C: Mitasyon**.

Here's why:

* **Mitasyon** is the primary source of *new* genetic variation. It's a random change in the DNA sequence.  The passage states ""Modifikasyon ajoute yon nouvo varyasyon jenetik,"" which directly refers to mutation.
* **Segregasyon** and **Rekonbinezon** redistribute existing genetic variation but don't *create* it.  Segregasyon simply separates alleles, and rekonbinezon shuffles existing alleles.
* **Eksprime** refers to the expression of genes, not the creation of new genetic variation.



Therefore, mutation is the process responsible for adding new genetic variation."
"Dapre enfòmasyon ki nan pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo yon primat ta dwe manje pou rezoud yon “pwoblèm pwoteyin”?","The correct answer is **C: Sotrèl (Insects)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that animal-based foods like ""foumi, tèmit, ze"" (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of protein with all essential amino acids.
* Options A, B, and D are all plant-based foods that the passage says are difficult for primates to digest, especially if uncooked.

Therefore, insects (sotrèl) are the option that aligns with the passage's description of a good protein source for primates."
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan pwoblèm ki annapre la yo ki pa akòz yon mank asid amine esansyèl?","The correct answer is **A: Pwoblèm dijesyon**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a major difficulty for primates is digesting plant-based resources, even if they have access to essential amino acids. It specifically mentions that plant-based proteins in leaves and vegetables are difficult to digest *unless* cooked.  Therefore, the difficulty in digestion is a direct consequence of the *type* of food (plant-based) and its digestibility, *not* a lack of essential amino acids.

While malnourishment, stunted growth, and death *can* result from the digestive problems caused by relying on difficult-to-digest plant material, the primary problem described in relation to the *digestion* itself is the difficulty of processing those resources.  The passage also directly links a lack of protein to the described problems.



"
Kijan manm yon sou-kilti espesyalman siyale asosyasyon yo souvan ak gwoup la?,"The correct answer is **D: Yo itilize estil kòm yon fòm senbolis**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Manm yon sou kilti souvan sinyale manm yo atravè yon itilizasyon diferan ak senbolik nan stil, ki gen ladan mod, manyè, ak ago."" (Members of a subculture often signal membership through a different and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manner, and jargon.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo eseye melanje** (They try to blend in): This is the opposite of what subcultures do. Subcultures are defined by *not* blending in.
* **B: Yo adopte kwayans tout moun ki toutotou yo** (They adopt the beliefs of everyone around them):  While some common beliefs might be shared, subcultures often have distinct beliefs that differentiate them.
* **C: Yo aksepte nòm sosyete yo** (They accept societal norms): Subcultures often challenge or deviate from societal norms.



"
"Dapre teyori ki prezante nan pasaj la, kisa ki ka rive yon timoun ki idantifye tèt li ak yon minorite rasyal yo deja fè lide sou li kòm minorite ki angaje l nan konpòtman menasan?","The correct answer is **B: Timoun lan ap gen plis tandans angaje l nan konpòtman menasan.**

Here's why:

The passage states that when children internalize negative stereotypes associated with their racial group (like being seen as unsuccessful in school), it *affects their behavior*.  It gives the specific example of children who are told they are not successful in school having a tendency to *not* perform well in school.  While the question asks about ""menasan"" (threatening) behavior, the logic follows that if a child internalizes a negative stereotype about their abilities, they are *more likely* to behave in ways that confirm that stereotype, which *could* manifest as perceived threatening behavior (e.g., acting out, withdrawing, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Timoun lan ap eseye evite angaje l nan konpòtman menasan:** The passage focuses on the *result* of internalizing stereotypes (lower performance), not a proactive attempt to avoid negative behavior.
* **C: Timoun lan ap retire tèt li nan sitiyasyon sosyal:**  While withdrawal *can* be a response to negative stereotypes, the passage doesn't directly support this as the primary outcome.
* **D: Timoun lan ap refize angaje l avèk lòt minorite rasyal yo:** The passage doesn't mention any specific reactions to other racial groups.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, konesans yon timoun sou lide ki deja fèt sou ras ka gen yon enpak sou kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo?","The correct answer is **B: Konpòtman yo (Their behavior)**.

The passage states that ""lide ki deja fèt yo afekte konpòtman yo"" which translates to ""preconceived notions affect their behavior.""  The example given directly supports this, showing how a child's belief about stereotypes related to their race impacts their academic performance (behavior).
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa gen anpil chans annakò avèk edikasyon yon timoun sovaj?","The correct answer is **B: Konpetans solid nan konvèsasyon (Solid conversational skills)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes ""feral"" children as exhibiting behaviors similar to animals.** A key characteristic of animal behavior is a lack of complex social interaction, including language and conversation. The passage specifically mentions ""apaperèz oswa endiferans fas ak imen yo"" (apathy or indifference towards humans). This directly implies a lack of developed conversational skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Viv yon fason endepandan (Living independently):** The passage *does* mention that some feral children live independently in the woods, so this is a behavior they *do* exhibit.
* **C: Tandans solitè (Solitary tendencies):**  While feral children might be solitary due to their lack of social interaction, the passage doesn't explicitly state this as a defining characteristic. It's more about the *reason* for the solitude - the absence of human socialization.
* **D: Anksyete sosyal (Social anxiety):**  The passage doesn't mention anxiety.  The primary issue is the *absence* of social skills, not necessarily anxiety.



Therefore, the option that is least likely to be associated with a feral child, based on the provided text, is **B: Konpetans solid nan konvèsasyon**.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki dekri avèk presizyon konpòtman sovaj kay timoun yo?","The correct answer is **B: Konpòtman sovaj la ka soti nan yon mank sosyalizasyon.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Youn nan metòd ki pi itilize pou montre enpòtans sosyalizasyon an se baze sou kèk ka deplorab timoun yo avèk neglijans, malè oswa abi volontè granmoun yo pat sosyalize yo pandan yo ti piti. Timoun sa yo rele """"feral"""" oswa sovaj.""  This directly links feral behavior to a lack of socialization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pifò konpòtman sovaj yo se akòz yon andikap fizik:** The passage mentions physical disabilities as *one reason* a child might be abandoned, but it doesn't say that physical disabilities *cause* feral behavior.
* **C: Konpòtman sovaj la se rive pi souvan sèlman kay timoun paran yo te konfine:** The passage describes children living in the woods, raised by animals, and not *just* confined to their parents' homes.
* **D: Tout konpòtman sovaj yo se akòz andikap entelektyèl grav:** The passage doesn't claim that intellectual disabilities *cause* feral behavior. It mentions abandoned children with intellectual disabilities as *one reason* for abandonment, but not as the primary cause of feral behavior itself.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan pratik ki annapre la yo ki pa annakò avèk agrikilti ki oryante sibzistans?","The correct answer is **B: Pwodui manje pou vann ba lòt moun (Produit des denrées alimentaires pour les vendre à d'autres).**

Here's why:

* **The passage defines subsistence agriculture as producing food *only* to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.** Selling food to others is the opposite of this.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with subsistence agriculture:

* **A: Konsantre sou yon pwodiksyon ki satisfè bezwen fanmi agrikiltè a (Concentrer sa production pour satisfaire les besoins de la famille agricole):** This is the core definition of subsistence agriculture.
* **C: Konsantre sou gwo rannman kontrèman ak teknik avanse (Se concentrer sur de gros rend au lieu d'utiliser des techniques avancées):**  While not *required* by subsistence agriculture, it's common. The passage mentions simple, often organic techniques.  A focus on large yields *without* advanced techniques aligns with the simple nature of subsistence farming.
* **D: Apwovizyònman nan semans lokal nan zòn agrikiltè a (L'approvisionnement en semences locales dans la zone agricole):**  Using local seeds is consistent with the passage's mention of saving seeds from the harvest and using techniques adapted to the local environment.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki dekri avèk presizyon pratik agrikilti pou sibzistans?,"The best answer is **A: Se yon sistèm ki totalman òganik**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Agrikilti sibsistans se yon sistèm senp, souvan òganik..."" This directly supports option A.
* **Option B:** While maximizing yield is a goal of subsistence farming, the text emphasizes *simple* techniques, not necessarily *unique* or advanced ones.
* **Option C:** The text mentions subsistence farming is primarily for the farmer and their family, not for widespread distribution.
* **Option D:** While subsistence farming *is* still practiced in some developing countries (as mentioned in the text), this isn't the defining characteristic of the practice itself.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate description based on the provided text."
Nan ki kategori touris vizit nan yon mize ta tonbe?,"The correct answer is **C: Touris kiltirèl**.

Here's why:

* **Touris kiltirèl (Cultural tourism)** focuses on experiencing the history, art, architecture, and way of life of a place. Museums are prime examples of cultural attractions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Touris biznis (Business tourism)** involves travel for work-related purposes (conferences, meetings, etc.).
* **Touris vakans (Vacation tourism)** is a broad category encompassing leisure travel, but a museum visit specifically relates to cultural experiences.
* **Touris anplennè (Adventure tourism)** focuses on physically challenging activities in natural environments.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki ta ka yon priyorite pou vwayajè lwazi yo?","The correct answer is **B: Pran yon brek nan woutin chak jou yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""Touris vakans lan...rann yo nan yon kote ki diferan anpil ak lavi kotidyen nòmal yo pou detann yo epi pran plezi yo."" (Vacation tourists...go to a place very different from their normal daily lives to relax and enjoy themselves.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Plonje tèt yo nan kilti lokal la:** While this *can* be a part of a vacation, the passage doesn't highlight it as the *primary* priority.
* **C: Wè pwen repè enpòtan yo:**  This is also possible, but the passage focuses more on the change of environment.
* **D: Konprann istwa yon kote:** Similar to C, this is a possibility but not the core idea presented about vacation tourism.



"
Kisa ki mansyone nan pasaj la kòm yon bagay ki te ede diminye laperèz chanjman nan legliz lokal la?,"The correct answer is **A: Sonje egzanp siksè nan konpòtman antreprenarya**.

The passage states: ""Sèvi ak ansyen egzanp konpòtman entrepenaryal ak siksè li te genyen, te ede moun yo aksepte nouvo chanjman ak nouvo oryantasyon pou legliz lokal."" This directly links success stories in entrepreneurial behavior to a decrease in apprehension towards change.

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they are not specifically stated as *what helped decrease apprehension towards change*.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ak kisa sa kapab ede lè yon moun konprann pwòp istwa pa l?","The correct answer is **C: Jwenn yon santiman plas andedan òganizasyon an.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mem si konpreyansyon istwa li an pa sipoze konpreyansyon kilti a, li pèmèt ak mwens moun konnen kote yo sitiye yo nan istwa òganizasyon an.""  This directly translates to understanding the organization's history helps individuals understand their place within it.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Diminye pè pou chanjman:** While the passage mentions that success stories help with change, it's not the *primary* benefit of understanding one's own history according to the text.
* **B: Ranfòsman valè yo:**  The passage mentions that the evaluation process *reveals* values, but it doesn't say that understanding history *reinforces* them.
* **D: Amelyore konpòtman antreprenarya:** The passage connects historical examples of entrepreneurial success to acceptance of change, but doesn't directly link understanding personal history to improved entrepreneurial behavior.



"
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki dekri avèk presizyon apwòch pòsmodèn aprantisaj la?,"The correct answer is **D: Pa gen okenn absoli nan aprantisaj (There are no absolutes in learning)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Apwòch pòsmodèn aprantisaj lan ofri libète pou chwazi ant absoli yo. Pa gen yon sèl bon fason pou aprann. An reyalite, pa gen yon sèl bon bagay pou aprann."" This directly aligns with the idea that there's no single, correct approach or outcome in learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kèk eksperyans aprantisaj pi benefik pase lòt (Some learning experiences are more beneficial than others):** The passage argues against this, emphasizing the lack of a single ""good"" thing to learn.
* **B: Aprantisaj la dwe konsantre sou bagay nou kwè nou pral viv (Learning should focus on things we believe we will live):** The passage provides examples of learning experiences people *don't* participate in or apply, directly contradicting this.
* **C: Sèten fason pou aprann pi bon pase lòt (Certain ways to learn are better than others):**  The passage argues against this, emphasizing the freedom to choose and the lack of a single ""good"" way to learn.



"
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki pa reflete avèk presizyon yon apwòch aprantisaj pòsmodèn?,"The answer is **B: Sèten eksperyans aprantisaj dwe gen priyorite sou lòt yo (Certain learning experiences should have priority over others)**.

Here's why:

* **Postmodern learning emphasizes relativism and the rejection of universal truths.**  The passage explicitly states ""Pa gen yon sèl bon fason pou aprann. An reyalite, pa gen yon sèl bon bagay pou aprann."" This means there's no inherent ranking of learning experiences.  All experiences are valid in their own context.
* **Option B directly contradicts this.** It asserts that some learning experiences are *more important* than others, which implies a hierarchical system – something postmodernism rejects.
* **Options A, C, and D align with postmodern learning:**
    * **A:** ""Gen anpil fason pou aprann enfòmasyon"" supports the postmodern idea of multiple valid approaches.
    * **C:** ""Yon eksperyans aprantisaj depann de moun k ap aprann lan ak konesans yo prezante a"" highlights the subjective and contextual nature of learning, a key postmodern concept.
    * **D:** ""Konesans nou gendwa pa janm aplike vo lapèn kanmenm pou nou aprann yo"" acknowledges that learning can be valuable even if it's not immediately practical, respecting the intrinsic value of knowledge.



Therefore, option B is the only one that doesn't reflect a postmodern approach to learning.

"Apre ou fin reveye delibereman pandan peryòd somèy nòmal la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ta jennen pwosesis entèripsyon somèy la?","The correct answer is **C: Etenn alam lan sou tabdenwi ou epi tounen pran somèy ven minit pita.**

Here's why:

* **Sleep Interruption:** The definition states sleep interruption involves briefly waking up and then going back to sleep. Option C directly reflects this - you wake up (by turning off the alarm) and then return to sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Lekti pandan inèdtan edmi anvan w tounen pran somèy:** While reading *can* occur during the time after a sleep interruption, it's not the defining action of the interruption itself.  The key is the *brief* wakefulness followed by a return to sleep.
* **B: Ale nan twalèt la epi tounen touswit nan kabann:**  Going to the bathroom *could* be part of a sleep interruption, as the text mentions using urination as a method. However, it doesn't explicitly state this is the *result* of the interruption.
* **D: Reveye pou bwè dlo nan yon boutèy ki sou tabdenwi ou:**  Similar to option B, waking up to get water is a potential consequence of a sleep interruption (using fluid intake to cause urination) but it's not the core action *of* the interruption itself.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate representation of a sleep interruption as described in the question."
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa yon deskripsyon egzat pou entèripsyon somèy?,"The correct answer is **B: Objektif la se pa reveye tèt ou konplètman (The objective is not to wake yourself up completely)**.

Here's why:

* **Sleep inertia** is characterized by a brief period of grogginess and reduced cognitive performance *after* waking up. The goal of sleep maintenance is to minimize this inertia by returning to sleep quickly.  The goal *is* to wake up briefly, but not to fully awaken.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate descriptions of sleep maintenance:

* **A: Li ka baze sou biyorit (It can be based on biorhythms):**  Biorhythms are indeed sometimes used as a factor in timing sleep maintenance.
* **C: Pwosesis la dewoule pandan peryòd nòmal somèy ou (The process unfolds during your normal sleep period):** Sleep maintenance happens within a regular sleep cycle.
* **D: Apre ou reveye, objektif la se tounen pran somèy nan lespas dezèdtan (After you wake up, the objective is to return to sleep in an irregular time slot):**  Sleep maintenance aims to return to sleep in a slightly irregular slot within the sleep cycle, rather than a completely regular one.



"
"Amezi sèvo a eseye fè rèv je klè pi souvan, kisa ki ogmante?","The correct answer is **D: Tan ant eta REM yo**.

Here's why:

The text states that the reason lucid dreaming can be tiring is because it lengthens the time spent in REM sleep.  If the brain is trying to induce lucid dreams *more often*, it's likely spending *more time* in REM sleep, meaning the time *between* REM cycles is compressed, leading to the feeling of being awakened frequently and potentially feeling fatigued.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kantite eta REM yo (Quantity of REM cycles):** The text says lucid dreaming *alongs* the REM cycle, not necessarily increases the overall *number* of cycles.
*   **B: Nivo enèji yo (Energy levels):**  The text indicates that lucid dreaming is tiring, implying a *decrease* in energy, not an increase.
*   **C: Dire eta rekiperasyon an (Duration of recovery state):** The text focuses on the *length of REM sleep*, not a general recovery state.



"
Kilès nan efè negatif ki annapre la yo rèv je klè souvan ta ka gen sou kò a?,"The correct answer is **B: Diminisyon REM yo pou chak nwit**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a major reason for the negative effects of lucid dreaming is that it *stretches* the time spent in REM sleep.  Therefore, the consequence is a *decrease* in the overall amount of REM sleep per night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diminisyon longè tan ant eta REM yo** (Decreased length of time between REM states): While there might be some connection, the core problem isn't about the *time between* REM states, but the *total time spent* in REM.
*   **C: Depandans sou rèv je klè** (Dependence on lucid dreaming): The passage doesn't mention dependence as a negative effect.
*   **D: Ogmantasyon REM yo pou chak nwit** (Increase in REMs per night): This is the opposite of what the passage describes."
"Dapre pasaj la, kijan ekip konvansyonèl yo ak ekip vityèl yo sanble?","The correct answer is **A: Yo atann pou toude ekip yo pèfòme nan menm nivo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ekip vityèl yo soumèt ak menm règleman ekselans yo menm jan ak ekip konvansyonèl yo..."" This directly indicates that the expectation for performance standards is the same for both types of teams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Toude ekip yo gen nivo otonomi varyab nan woutin toulejou yo:** The passage highlights that virtual teams often have *more* autonomy than traditional teams.
* **C: Toude ekip yo rapòte ba yon ekip jesyon envizib:** While virtual teams have an ""invisible team"" for accountability, the passage doesn't say traditional teams do.
* **D: Toude ekip yo fonksyone nan menm lè zòn lan:**  A key difference between virtual and traditional teams is that virtual teams can operate across different time zones.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki deklarasyon konsènan ekip fizik yo ak vityèl yo ki pa vre?","The correct answer is **A: Ekip konvansyonèl yo anjeneral kenbe nan yon estanda ki pi wo.**

Here's why:

The passage states that virtual teams submit to the *same* standards of excellence as conventional teams, with only minimal differences. It doesn't say that conventional teams maintain a *higher* standard. In fact, the passage emphasizes the similarities.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: Ekip vityèl yo souvan aji kòm pwen kontak pou ekip konvansyonèl yo:** The passage explicitly states, ""Manm ekip vityèl yo fonksyone souvan tankou pwen kontak gwoup fizik imedya yo a.""
* **C: Ekip konvansyonèl yo gen mwens otonomi pase ekip vityèl yo:** The passage says virtual teams ""gen souvan plis otonomi pase manm ekip konvansyonèl yo.""
* **D: Lè zòn varyab ka benefisye ekip vityèl yo:**  The passage explains that virtual teams are beneficial because they can meet across time zone differences. This highlights a situation where the flexibility of a virtual team is advantageous.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa yon bagay ki teyori kontni yo santre sou li?,"The correct answer is **A: Nouvo dezi ki konkretize nan laj granmoun**.

Here's why:

* **Theory of Content** focuses on the underlying *needs and motivations* that drive human behavior. It's about *why* people do what they do.
* **Option A** talks about ""new desires that become concrete in old age."" This describes the *manifestation* of desires, not the underlying needs themselves.  While desires are important, theory of content is focused on the underlying drives that lead to those desires.
* **Options B, C, and D** *are* central to theory of content:
    * **B: Fason anviwònman yon moun afekte aksyon li** - This relates to how external factors influence needs and motivation.
    * **C: Bezwen ki enteryorize** -  This directly refers to the core of theory of content - the internalized needs that guide behavior.
    * **D: Konprann sa moun yo renmen** - Understanding what people value and are motivated by is a key aspect of understanding their needs.



Therefore, option A is the outlier because it focuses on the *outcomes* (desires) rather than the *underlying drivers* (needs) that theory of content seeks to explain."
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa yon objè nan règ twazyèm yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Kreye lavi ak enèji nan yon foto** (Create life and energy in a photo).

Here's why:

* **Règ twazyèm yo** (The Rule of Thirds) is about composition and placement of elements within an image. It's a guideline for creating visually appealing and balanced photos.
* **Options A, C, and D** all directly relate to how the Rule of Thirds functions:
    * **A: Kreye yon baz pou kote yo ta ka mete sijè a** -  The intersections of the lines are good places to put the subject.
    * **C: Kenbe sijè a nan yon kote presi ak efikas** - The Rule of Thirds helps position the subject strategically.
    * **D: Etabli lòd nan yon foto** -  The Rule of Thirds contributes to a sense of order and balance.
* **B: Kreye lavi ak enèji nan yon foto** is a broader artistic concept. While good composition *can* contribute to life and energy, it's not a direct or defining element of the Rule of Thirds itself.  It's more about the overall aesthetic and mood.



Therefore, the option that *doesn't* directly describe a component of the Rule of Thirds is **B**."
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa dekri fòma fotografi 35mm la?,"The correct answer is **C: Li gen yon rapò aspè diferan ak anpil fòma kouran.**

Here's why:

* **A: Li toujou nan pwodiksyon:**  35mm film is still produced, though in smaller quantities.
* **B: Fòma kamera dijital yo te adopte li:** 35mm is a very common sensor size in digital cameras.
* **D: Li se fòma ki pi kouran nan lemonn:** While digital cameras are dominant, 35mm film is still widely used, especially in certain photography niches.

* **C: Li gen yon rapò aspè diferan ak anpil fòma kouran:** This statement is **incorrect**. The question states the aspect ratio is 3:2, which *is* common for many current formats, including most digital sensors and a common aspect ratio for video.



Therefore, option C is the only one that *doesn't* accurately describe the 35mm format."
"Dapre pasaj la, amezi fabrikan yo ogmante kalite a nan pwodiksyon lantiy yo, kijan objektif zoum yo te amelyore?","The correct answer is **C: Kalite foto yo sanble ak objektif ki gen distans fokal fiks.**

The passage states: ""Sa te pèmèt objektiv zoum yo pwodwi imaj ki gen yon kalite konparab ak sa nou jwenn avèk objektif ki gen longè fokal fiks yo.""  This directly translates to ""This allowed zoom lenses to produce images with a quality comparable to those obtained with fixed focal length lenses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo gen pi gwo vitès objektif:** The passage states the *opposite* – that the maximum aperture (speed) of zoom lenses is typically low.
* **B: Yo pi fasil pou itilize nan kondisyon limyè ki fèb:**  The passage says zoom lenses are *difficult* to use in low light conditions due to their lower maximum aperture.
* **D: Yo gen mwens konpleksite fokal pase objektif prensipal yo:** The passage explains zoom lenses have *more* focal complexity due to the range of focal lengths.



"
"Dapre enfòmasyon ki nan pasaj la, kilè yon objektif zoum ta ka pi bon pase yon objektif prensipal?","The correct answer is **C: Si ou pa vle sèvi ak yon flach nan anviwònman ki pi sonm.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yon lòt dezavantaj objektif zoum lan sèke ouvèti maksimòm (vitès lan) objektif lan abityèlman ba. Sa rann objèktif zoum ki pa twò chè yo difisil pou itilize nan kondisyon ki gen fèb limyozite san flach.""

This means that while zoom lenses have a lower maximum aperture (less light gathering), they are *better* for situations with low light *if you want to avoid using a flash*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Si yon gwo ouvèti maksimòm se yon priyorite:** The passage explicitly states that zoom lenses typically have *low* maximum apertures, so this is the opposite of what they offer.
* **B: Si ou vle mwens eleman objektif:** The passage says zoom lenses have *more* elements, not fewer.
* **D: Si w ap chèche plis konpleksite fokal:** The passage says zoom lenses are *better* at achieving image quality comparable to fixed focal length lenses, indicating they offer *more* focal complexity.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa ta konsidere kòm yon deskripsyon egzat sou Mit?,"The correct answer is **D: Aksan ki mete sou rechèch yon eksperyans pèsonèl dirèk konparab ak anpil lòt fòm kwayans relijye ak kilt**.

Here's why:

The definition of Mit specifically highlights that it distinguishes itself by emphasizing *direct personal experience* of a particular state of consciousness, often described as peaceful, enlightened, blessed, or joyful.  Option D states that this personal experience is *comparable* to other religious and cultural forms of belief.  This contradicts the key differentiator of the Mit tradition, which is its unique focus on this type of direct experience.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the definition:

* **A: Yo mete yon aksan sou eksperyans eta konsyans pezib ak beni:** The definition states that Mit practitioners seek experiences of peace, enlightenment, blessing, or joy – all indicative of a peaceful and blessed state of consciousness.
* **B: Disip Mit yo chèche yon priz konsyans konsyan de yon verite espirityèl:**  The definition mentions a direct experience of the divine or the spiritual truth.
* **C: Disip Mit yo ta ka adopte pratik ki pral ede nouri konpreyansyon yo sou reyalite diven an:** The definition acknowledges the use of practices to support this journey of spiritual understanding.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa yon konsantrasyon sou Mit?","The correct answer is **B: Pousuiv apèsi pa mwayen eksperyans pataje, kominotè.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that *Mysticism* is characterized by a direct, personal experience of the divine, rather than reliance on shared experiences or communal practices. Options A, C, and D all align with the core aspects of mystical seeking: direct experience, a state of grace, and conscious awareness of the divine. Option B, however, specifically mentions ""shared experiences, communal"" practices, which directly contradicts the mystical emphasis on individual, direct encounter.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki moun ki te petèt kòmanse yon sosyete agrikilti?","The correct answer is **C: Moun Maori nan Polinezi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Teyori a aprè te etabli lide pèp maori a te migre sòti Polinezi nan yon Gwo Flòt epi te pran Nouvèl Zelann Moriori yo..."" This directly indicates that the Maori, who migrated from Polynesia, were the ones who established the agricultural society in New Zealand.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, gwoup ki te lachas moas yo, se premye abitan kikote yo te ye?","The correct answer is **B: Nouvèl Zelann**.

The passage states: ""Pandan lontan, pandan diznevyèm ak ventyèm syèk yo, yo te kwè premye abitan Nouvèl Zelann yo te Maoris..."" 

Therefore, the group that hunted moas was believed to be the first inhabitants of New Zealand.
"
Nan ki senaryo itilizasyon metòd origami Pureland lan benefisye pliyè a?,"The correct answer is **D: Pliyè a te eseye sèlman youn oswa de fwa anvan.**

Here's why:

* **Origami Pureland** is designed for beginners or those with limited experience. It relies on simple folds and allows for multiple folds to be made simultaneously.
* **Option D** directly reflects this purpose. If someone is just starting out (or has only tried a few times), the simplicity and simultaneous fold capability of Pureland would be beneficial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pliyè a prefere fè plizyè pli an menm tan:** While Pureland *does* involve multiple simultaneous folds, it's not specifically about preferring them. The key benefit is that it allows for this *even with limited skill*.
* **B: Pliyè a gen konpetans mouvman avanse:**  Pureland is specifically *not* for advanced folders. It's designed for those *without* advanced skills.
* **C: Pliyè a ap kreye origami ki mande pli envèse:** Pureland explicitly prohibits reverse folds.  Therefore, this scenario would *not* benefit from using this technique.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa dekri avèk presizyon origami Pureland?,"The correct answer is **A: Li fèt pou pliyè ki gen eksperyans** (It's made for experienced folders).

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""pli yo pi difisil tankou pli tèt anba yo ki pa otorize..."" (folds are more difficult like prohibited upside-down folds...). This directly contradicts the statement that it's for inexperienced folders. The restrictions make it a challenging model.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions:

* **B: Metòd la pa gen pli envèse nan li** (The method has no reverse folds): The prompt explicitly states that upside-down folds (""pli tèt anba yo ki pa otorize"") are *not* allowed, implying the method avoids reverse folds.
* **C: Pli yo dwe gen kote ki senp** (The folds must have simple locations): The prompt states that all folds have ""anplasman senp yo"" (simple locations).
* **D: Se yon bon metòd pou pliyè ki gen konpetans mouvman limite** (It's a good method for folders with limited movement): The prompt mentions it was developed to help those with limited experience or physical limitations.



Therefore, option A is the only one that is *incorrect* based on the provided information.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kikote ki pa asosye ak Sivilizasyon Valley Indus la?","The correct answer is **B: Rivyè Sarasvati a**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that while some scholars speculate about a civilization existing in the Sarasvati River basin, the civilization is *primarily* known as the Indus Valley Civilization.
* The other options (Harappa, northern Afghanistan, and most of modern Pakistan) *are* directly mentioned as being part of the geographical area covered by the Indus Valley Civilization.

Therefore, the Sarasvati River is the only option not directly associated with the Indus Valley Civilization according to the text.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa mansyone kòm yon non posib pou Sivilizasyon Laj Bwonz ki diskite nan pasaj la?,"The correct answer is **C: Sivilizasyon Rivyè Indus la**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions ""Sivilizasyon Vale Indus"" and ""Sivilizasyon Indus-Saravasti"" as possible names.
* ""Sivilizasyon Arapa"" is also mentioned.
* **""Sivilizasyon Rivyè Indus la""** is a valid and commonly used name for the Indus Valley Civilization, but it's not specifically listed in the passage as a potential name. Therefore, it's the correct answer.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pwodui yon benefis sou long peryòd?","The correct answer is **A: Kowopere ak lòt yo (Cooperate with others)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Espere ke, gen kek moun ki panse pi bon chwa yo genyen sou yon long peryod se travay ansanm avek lot moun."" (Hopefully, some people think the best choices are those to work together with others on a long term.) This directly supports the idea that cooperation leads to long-term benefits.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bay priyorite pou enterè pwòp tèt ou (Prioritize your own interests):** This is described as a short-term gain, not long-term.
* **C: Mete aksan sou sa ki ta benefisye minorite a olye majorite a (Focus on benefiting the minority instead of the majority):**  The passage discusses selfishness, not prioritizing the minority.
* **D: Rekonèt ke Kipidite ka benefisye (Recognize that selfishness can benefit):** The passage criticizes selfishness and doesn't suggest it's beneficial.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo yon moun ta ka bay priyorite si li konsantre l sou avantaj imedya?","The correct answer is **D: Egoyis**.

The passage states that ""an egoistic way"" leads to gaining more in a short time. Therefore, if someone prioritizes immediate advantage, they would focus on being egoistic."
"Dapre pasaj la, ki moun ki te kouvri yon pòsyon enpòtan nan depans pou lagè yo?","The correct answer is **D: Pèp Filipino yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yo te kontrent yo peye enpo ak rejim kolonyal ameriken yo pou kouvri yon gwo pati depans yo..."" (They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses...) This directly indicates that the Filipino people bore a significant portion of the cost.
"
Ki peryòd tan ki te vini anvan laj Tanpliye yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Wo Mwayennaj**.

Here's why:

* The text states the Templar period falls within the High Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries).
* It also mentions that the High Middle Ages precedes the Late Middle Ages (roughly 1500).
* Therefore, the period *before* the Templar period was the High Middle Ages.
"
Ki peryòd tan ki te vini apre laj Tanpliye yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Fen Mwayennaj**.

The text states that the High Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries) came before the Late Middle Ages (roughly 1500). Therefore, the period *after* the Templars is the Late Middle Ages, or the end of the Middle Ages.
"
Ki tretman oswa pwosedi medikal ki pa mansyone kòm sa doktè ak chirijyen yo te itilize pandan Anpi Women an?,"The correct answer is **A: Trete twoub estrès pòs-twomatik avèk divès kalite sedatif**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions the use of mofinn (from peacock seeds) and scopolamine (from henbane seeds) as sedatives and pain relievers.
* It also mentions amputation and using clamps to stop blood flow.
* There is no mention of treating PTSD or using sedatives specifically for that purpose.

Therefore, option A is the only treatment/procedure *not* mentioned in the provided text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ke yo pa atribiye a pwogrè ki te fèt nan domèn medikal pandan Anpi Women an?","The correct answer is **B: Politik militè agresif Anpi a**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that emperors like Augustus recruited doctors and formed the first military medical corps. This directly links the military to the development of medicine.
* The passage details medical advancements like surgery, the use of various substances for pain management, and techniques for treating infections and injuries.
* The passage mentions the formation of a medical corps, which is a direct result of the advancements discussed.
* The passage mentions the emperor's role in recruiting doctors.

Military policies, while potentially impacting medical needs, are *not* directly linked to the specific medical advancements described in the passage. The passage focuses on the actions taken *within* the medical field and by the emperor to advance medicine, not on the broader political motivations of the empire.
"
De kisa kapasite pou wè depann?,"The best answer is **B: Egzijans yon òganis (The needs of the organism)**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states that the complexity of the eye varies based on the organism's requirements.**  This directly links the eye's construction and capacity to what the organism *needs* to see (e.g., detecting predators, finding food, navigating).

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

* **A: Ògàn sansoryèl sistèm vizyèl yo (The visual sensory system):** While true, it's too broad.  The paragraph is saying it's *driven* by the organism's needs, not just inherent to the system.
* **C: Yon sansibilite ak sèten longè ond (Certain sensitivity and wavelengths):** This is a *characteristic* of the eye, but not the fundamental *dependency* of its capacity.
* **D: Diferan degre akuite (Different degrees of acuity):** Acuity is a *result* of the eye's design, influenced by the organism's needs, but not the primary dependency.



Therefore, the statement about how the capacity for sight depends on the needs of the organism is the most accurate and aligns directly with the information provided in the passage."
Sou kisa varyasyon estrikti zye ant òganis yo depann?,"The correct answer is **B: Egzijans òganis la (The organism's demands)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the complexity and different structures of eyes vary depending on the demands of the organism. This is a general principle of evolution - structures develop to meet the needs of an organism's environment and lifestyle.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Sansiblite longè ond yo (Wavelength sensitivity)**: While wavelength sensitivity *is* a characteristic of eyes, the passage says the *range* of sensitivity is what varies based on the organism's needs, not just the sensitivity itself.
*   **C: Nivo akuite (Level of acuity)**: Acuity (sharpness of vision) is a result of the eye's structure, but the passage states that the *entire structure* varies according to the organism's demands, not just acuity.
*   **D: Konpleksite òganis lan (Complexity of the organism)**: While more complex organisms *might* have more complex eyes, the passage explicitly says it's about the organism's *needs* that drive the variation, not just the organism's overall complexity.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki deklarasyon sou Sikis ki pa dekri relijyon an avèk presizyon?","The correct answer is **B: Gouwou a se yon aspè fondamantal inik nan Sikis**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gourou an se yon aspè fondamantal tout relijyon endyèn yo, men nan sikhism, li te pran yon enpòtans ki fòmenwayo kwayans sikhes yo."" This indicates that while Gurus are important in other Indian religions, their role is *particularly* significant and unique in Sikhism. Therefore, claiming it's *just* a fundamental aspect of Sikhism is inaccurate.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Sikis se te rezilta yon divizyon sèktè nan tradisyon Endou a:** The passage explicitly says the religion arose from a religious split within Hinduism.
* **C: Nèf gouwou te vini apre fondatè relijyon an, Guru Nanak:** The passage directly states that nine other Gurus followed Guru Nanak.
* **D: Sèten tradisyon nan Sikis yo chouke nan rasin Endouyis:**  The passage mentions that while Sikhism has its own distinct identity, it's ""fonde nan rasin Endouyis.""

Therefore, only option B misrepresents the passage's information about the role of Gurus in Sikhism.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki konsidere kòm yon aspè debaz nan sistèm kwayans Sikh la?","The correct answer is **A: Konsèp gouwou a**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Gourou an se yon aspè fondamantal tout relijyon endyèn yo, men nan sikhism, li te pran yon enpòtans ki fòmenwayo kwayans sikhes yo."" (The Guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism, it took on a significance that shaped the beliefs of Sikhs.)

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Tradisyon Endou yo:** While Sikhs acknowledge their roots in Hinduism, the passage states they consider Sikhism a separate religion.
* **C: Yon refi pou rekonèt lòt relijyon Endyen yo:** The passage indicates the opposite - they *recognize* their roots in Hinduism.
* **D: Pale lang Pendjabi a:** The passage mentions the Punjabi word for Guru, but doesn't state that speaking Punjabi is a core belief.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, sou kisa timoun ki gen Twoub Defisitè Atansyon ta ka gen difikilte pou konsantre?","The correct answer is **A: Travay lekòl**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Timoun ki gen TDA yo gen pwoblèm pou konsantre yo sou bagay tankou travay lekòl yo...""

While the passage also mentions they *can* concentrate on things they enjoy, it's the *difficulty* with schoolwork that's specifically highlighted as a problem. The other options are mentioned as things they *can* concentrate on.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, poukisa timoun ki gen Twoub Defisitè Atansyon yo gen tandans angaje yo nan konpòtman ki riske?","The correct answer is **D: Pou estimile sèvo yo**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Timoun sa yo gen tandans atire anpil pwoblèm, paske yo 'adopte kèk konpòtman riske, batay epi defye otorite' pou devlope sèvo yo, paske sa p ap kapab devlope pa metòd nòmal yo.""

This directly indicates that they engage in risky behaviors to stimulate their brains because their brains don't develop in the typical way. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"Dapre enfòmasyon ki nan pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa yon egzanp echafodaj?","The correct answer is **C: Yon pwogram etid endepandan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines scaffolding as support for learning a new experience.** It explicitly states that a teacher *is* a form of scaffolding and even a small help function like the ""thrombones"" (a typo for ""tutors"") in Microsoft Office is scaffolding.
* **A self-study program is designed for independent learning, not direct support or guidance.** It doesn't offer the kind of temporary structure or assistance that scaffolding provides. 
* **Option A (a specific lesson in a computer game) and B (a specific teacher) are both examples of scaffolding.** They provide focused support for learning a new skill or concept.
* **Option D (a little league coach) is also an example of scaffolding.** Coaches provide guidance and support to help players learn and improve.



Therefore, the self-study program is the only option that doesn't fit the definition of scaffolding presented in the passage."
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa dekri avèk presizyon konsèp echafodaj la?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo rele l tou aprantisaj ki baze sou pwojè (It's also called project-based learning)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that scaffolding is *not* a teaching method, but rather a support system. It clarifies that project-based learning *uses* scaffolding to make learning easier and more engaging.  Therefore, calling scaffolding ""project-based learning"" is inaccurate.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate descriptions of scaffolding from the provided text:

*   **A: Echafodaj ka egziste yon fason vityèl (Scaffolding can exist in a virtual way):**  The text directly mentions virtual scaffolding.
*   **B: Se plis yon èd pase yon metòd aprantisaj (It's more of a help than a teaching method):**  This is a core concept of what scaffolding *is* according to the passage.
*   **D: Yo itilize echafodaj yo pou ofri sipò nan kòmansman yon eksperyans aprantisaj (Scaffolding is used to offer support in the beginning of a learning experience):**  The text describes scaffolding as supporting learners when tackling new projects or tasks.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki karakteristik MySpace ki ta ka benefisye elèv ki gen pwoblèm avèk lekti?","The correct answer is **A: Pèsonalizasyon**.

Here's why:

The passage states that MySpace can be personalized ""pou li ka pi fasil pou li"" (to make it easier for them). This directly addresses the needs of students who have difficulty with reading. A personalized interface can be tailored to their preferences (like colors) making it less visually overwhelming and easier to navigate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Blòg yo:** While blogs are a feature, the passage doesn't link them to helping students with reading difficulties.
* **C: Yon adrès Entènèt:**  The address being easily accessible is helpful for access, not specifically for reading difficulties.
* **D: 54 milyon pwofil:** The number of profiles is irrelevant to helping students with reading challenges.

"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa te fè pati repons Krushchev pou emèt travayè yo?","The correct answer is **C: Ogmante rediksyon salè yo (Increase salary reductions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Khrushchev *did* fulfill the following:

*   **Nominated a new Prime Minister:** ""te asepte nome Wladyslaw Gomulka...nonvo premye minis""
*   **Sent troops to restore order:** ""Krushchev te voye cha pou retabli lòd""
*   **Agreed to some economic demands:** ""li te bay kèk demann ekonomik""

The passage *doesn't* say Khrushchev agreed to *increase* salary reductions; it implies the opposite – that he addressed economic demands, likely including issues related to wages. So, increasing salary reductions is not something mentioned as part of his response.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa te yon kòz emèt nan Polòy yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kominis**.

Here's why:

The passage states the protests in Poland in 1956 were *because of* a lack of food and decreasing wages. These are direct economic grievances. While the protests ultimately led to a change in leadership (Gomulka being appointed), the *cause* of the protests was the economic hardship.

The options B, C, and D were all factors *leading to* or *resulting from* the protests.  Communism itself wasn't the *direct* cause of the protests; rather, dissatisfaction with the economic conditions *under* the communist regime fueled the protest.

Therefore, communism is the least directly linked to the *initial* causes of the protests as described in the text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa te afekte relasyon ant URSS ak USA?","The correct answer is **B: Opinyon sou Almay**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states:

* **Common enemy (Germany):** Led to cooperation.
* **System clash:** Led to the end of cooperation and the start of the Cold War.
* **Process/Culture differences:** Contributed to the end of cooperation and the start of the Cold War.
* **Conflicts (Afganistan, Cuba, etc.):**  Were part of the Cold War.

While differing opinions on Germany existed, the passage doesn't explicitly connect them to the breakdown of the alliance or the start of the Cold War. The other options are directly mentioned as factors that *did* affect the relationship.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa dekri avèk presizyon objektif pou voye enpilsyon nè nan tout kò a?,"The correct answer is **A: Ralanti sikilasyon san (Slowing blood circulation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the nervous system *maintains* the sending of nerve impulses for movement and protection.** This implies *active* processes.
* **Slowing blood circulation is the opposite of an active process.** Slowing circulation would *impair* the nervous system's ability to efficiently transmit impulses.
* **The other options are consistent with the passage:**
    * **B: Jere sikilasyon san (Regulating blood circulation):**  The nervous system plays a role in regulating blood flow to ensure tissues receive adequate oxygen and nutrients.
    * **C: Kenbe omeyostazi (Maintaining homeostasis):** This is the overarching function described in the passage.
    * **D: Evite menas kòporèl ki posib (Avoiding possible physical threats):**  Rapid nerve impulse transmission is crucial for detecting and reacting to threats.

Therefore, slowing blood circulation is the only option that contradicts the passage's description of the nervous system's function.
"
Kisa ou ka jwenn nan Plato Gizeh?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonm yo** and **B: Tanp yo** and **D: Gwo Piramid lan**.

The text explicitly states that Giza Plateau contains ""plizyè piramid (se gran piramid li an ki pi gwo), plizyè ti tonm, plizyè tanp epi gwo Sphinx.""  It also mentions the Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu.

Therefore, options A, B, and D are all correct based on the provided text. However, since only one answer can be selected, and option D is specifically mentioned as the most prominent structure, it's the best single answer. However, including A and B would be more accurate.

If forced to choose only one, **D: Gwo Piramid lan** is the most direct and prominent answer based on the text. However, acknowledging options A and B would also be accurate.
"
Ki objektif Gwo Piramid lan?,"The correct answer is **B: Pou onore yon farawon**.

The text explicitly states: ""Gwo piramid la te kreye pou onore farawon Khoufou...""
"
Kilès ki responsab konesans nou sou metè dife ki te detwi tanp lan?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabon**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Istoryen grèk Strabo te note pita non, nou konnen jodi a."" (The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, which we know today.)

Therefore, Strabo is the source of our knowledge about the arsonist's name, Herostratus. The other options are incorrect:

* **Efezyen yo (The Ephesians):** They were the victims and reacted to the event, but they didn't record the arsonist's name.
* **Alexandre le Grand (Alexander the Great):** He offered to pay for the reconstruction, but wasn't responsible for knowing the arsonist's identity.
* **Artemis:** She was the deity the temple was dedicated to, not responsible for the arson.



"
Kisa ki yon deklarasyon egzat konsènan rekonstriksyon tanp Atemis la?,"The correct answer is **B: Li te rebati apre rèy Alexandre le Grand**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Aprè Aleksann vin mouri, tanp lan vin rekonstwi 323 lane anvan Jezi kri."" (After Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt 323 years before Jesus Christ.)
* Option A is incorrect because the text says Alexander *offered* to pay, but the Ephesians refused.
* Option C is incorrect because the text states Herostratus was not offered any compensation, but rather his name was cursed.
* Option D is incorrect because the text states the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC, not 320 BC.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè ki pi bonè yon espès te kapab mache sou de janm?","The correct answer is **A: Sèt milyon ane de sa**.

The passage states: ""menm lòske Sahelanthropus te mache sou de pye sa gen **sèt mylion** ane anviron."" This translates to ""even when Sahelanthropus walked on two legs about **seven million** years ago.""
"
Kilès nan espès ki annapre la yo ki te mache regilyèman sou de pye?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

* **Homo Erectus** is explicitly mentioned in the text as being associated with the start of regular bipedal walking around 1.9 million years ago.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Sahelanthropus:** While the text mentions *Sahelanthropus* walking on two legs 7 million years ago, it doesn't say they walked *regularly*.  The text implies their bipedalism was more rudimentary.
* **Espesyalizasyon bipèd (Bipedal specialization):** This is a *description* of bipedalism, not a species.
* **Australopithecus:** The text states Australopithecus showed some bipedal features, but it also says they weren't *better* at walking on two legs than humans are today.  It doesn't indicate they walked regularly on two legs.



"
Kisa marin Alman an te eseye akonpli pandan WWII?,"The correct answer is **B: Anpeche Grann Bretay resevwa moun ak machandiz**

The passage explicitly states: ""Youn nan egzanp ki resan plis remakab yo se kanpay Atlantik Nò a pandan WWII la. Ameriken yo te tante fè travèse oseyan atlantik lan ak nèg epi materyèl pou ede Grand Bretay. **An menm tan, marin alman ki itilize prensipalman soumaren tap eseye kanpe trafik sa.**""  ""Kanpe trafik sa"" means to prevent goods and people from reaching Great Britain.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Entèsepte machandiz ki soti nan Grann Bretay:**  While the Germans *did* intercept goods, the passage focuses on preventing them from *reaching* Britain.
* **C: Transpòte materyèl atravè Atlantik la:** This describes the American effort, not the German one.
* **D: Anpeche Amerik resevwa moun ak machandiz:** The passage focuses on Great Britain, not the United States.



"
"Dapre enfòmasyon yo bay nan pasaj la, kilès ki te gen plis siksè nan gè naval la pandan Kanpay Atlantik Nò a?","The correct answer is **D: Britanik yo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Si alye yo te echwe, Almay t ap san dout konkeri Grand Bretay tankou l te fè pou rès Ewòp lan."" This implies that the Allies (including the British and Americans) *did not* fail, and therefore were successful. The passage highlights the struggle, but the implication is that the Allies ultimately prevailed, preventing a German conquest of Britain. Therefore, the British were a key part of the successful Allied effort.
"
Kisa ki pa te egziste lè Asiryen yo te itilize kavalri?,"The correct answer is **B: Abalèt**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the *Envansyon kawoutchou ak reyon yo* (invention of rubber and rays) made Assyrian chariots lighter and faster. It also mentions that *flèch abalèt mòtèl yo* (deadly aboot arrows) were used. However, it doesn't say aboot arrows *didn't* exist when Assyrians used cavalry. The passage focuses on advancements *during* their use of cavalry.

The passage explicitly mentions chariots, cuirasses, and the invention of the chariot itself. It doesn't imply that aboot arrows were nonexistent. Therefore, aboot arrows is the only option that isn't directly discussed as a development *related to* the use of Assyrian cavalry in the text.
"
Kijan batay ki itilize kavalri dewoule?,"The correct answer is **C: Sou do cheval (On horseback)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nan 1000 Avan J.C, asyryen yo te lanse premye kavalri a. Yon kavalri se yon lame ki goumen sou do chwal. Sèl chwal potko envante, kidonk kavalye asiryen yo te goumen sou do chwal yo tou konsa.""

This means the Assyrian cavalry fought *on horseback*.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kikote ou pa t ap jwenn yon sitwayen Babilòn mwayen?","The correct answer is **D: Pote sakrifis nan yon sanktyè enteryè**.

Here's why:

The passage states that only priests could enter the inner sanctuary of the temple. It implies that ordinary citizens were *not* allowed access. The other options (A, B, and C) all describe activities that regular citizens participated in at the temples.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki te fèt pou prèt yo presizeman?,"The correct answer is **B: Sanktyè enteryè yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...yon lakou nan tanp lan ki louvri, epi yon **sanktyè enteryè kote sèl prèt yo kapab rantre**."" 
* The passage also mentions priests conducting ceremonies and festivals to satisfy the gods. While priests participate in these, the inner sanctuary is specifically described as a place *for them*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Festival yo:**  While priests participate in festivals, the festivals themselves aren't *made* for priests. They are religious events.
* **C: Seremoni yo:** Similar to festivals, priests perform ceremonies, but the ceremonies aren't specifically *made* for them.
* **D: Zigoura yo:** Ziggurats were temples themselves, and the upper sanctuary was a sacred space, but they weren't specifically *made* for priests in the same way the inner sanctuary was.



"
Kilè wa Tutankhamun te vin popilè?,"The correct answer is **C: Apre dekouvèt tonm li**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dekouvèt tonm li an, an 1922 te fè li vin yon selebrite."" (The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity.)
"
Kisa ki te fè wa Tutankhamun yon wa Ejipsyen byen koni?,"The correct answer is **A: Dekouvèt tonm li ki rete entak** (Discovery of his tomb remaining intact).

The passage explicitly states: ""Sepandan, dekouvèt tonm li an, an 1922 te fè li vin yon selebrite."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity.) and ""Alòske anpil tonm nan pase te vole, tonm sa te rete prèske vyèj."" (While many tombs had been looted, his tomb remained almost untouched.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Estati li sou ansyen lis wa yo** (His status on ancient lists of kings): The passage says he wasn't even inscribed on most lists of ancient kings.
* **C: Vòl plizyè milye atefa nan tonm li** (The theft of thousands of artifacts from his tomb): The passage says his tomb *remained* almost untouched, implying artifacts weren't stolen *from* it.
* **D: Enpòtans li nan tan ansyen Ejipsyen yo** (His importance in ancient Egyptian times): The passage suggests he wasn't particularly important in ancient times; his fame came *after* his tomb was discovered.



"
Kisa powèt grèk Homère pa te kapab fè?,"The answer is **B: Wè** (See).

The text states that Homer was a ""legendary blind poet."" This means he was unable to see.
"
Ki grèk selèb yo konnen pou yon lòt bagay ki pa literati?,"The correct answer is **C: Pitagò**. 

Here's why:

* **Homère** is famous for his poetry (Iliad and Odyssey).
* **Sofòkl** and **Aristofan** are famous for their plays.
* **Pitagò** is known for the Pythagorean theorem in mathematics.

Therefore, Pitagò is the only one on the list who is known for something other than literature.
"
Kikote fanmi ebre a te pase yon gran pati nan tan yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Nan lakou a**.

The text states: ""Fanm yo te fè manje nan lakou an..."" which translates to ""Women made food in the courtyard..."" This indicates that the family spent a significant amount of time in the courtyard.
"
Kisa ki pa te trè enpòtan pou fanmi ebre a?,"The correct answer is **C: Kay yo (Houses)**.

The passage states: ""Nan klima cho Mwayen Oryan, kay la pat si enpòtan."" which translates to ""In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.""

Therefore, the house was not considered very important to the family.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa dekri kòm yon diferans ant peyi Eskandinav yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Tè a**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that there are differences between the Scandinavian countries in terms of:

*   **People:** ""malgre chak peyi swa 'Eskandinav', gen anpil diferans ant pèp yo"" (although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people)
*   **Kings:** ""wa yo"" (kings)
*   **Customs:** ""koutim yo"" (customs)
*   **History:** ""istwa"" (history)

The passage doesn't mention any differences in the **land** itself. Therefore, ""Tè a"" (The Land) is the only option that isn't presented as a distinguishing factor.



"
Ki moun ki te rete nan Groenland an premye?,"The correct answer is **A: Tribi Eskimo yo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Men malgre dekouvèt li an, tribi Eskimo yo te deja ap vivn an epòk la."" (But despite his discovery, the Inuit tribes were already living there at the time.)
"
Ki gwoup ki ta prefere dine san chèz?,"The correct answer is **C: Gason Women Rich yo** 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diferans lan se te pandan pòv yo ak fanm lan te chita sou chèz yo ap manje, moun rich yo te renmen gen bankè ansanm pandan yo te lonje kò pandan yo t ap manje."" 

This means the wealthy men preferred to dine without chairs, reclining while eating, while poorer women sat on chairs.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa t ap fè pati yon fèt ansyen Women?,"The correct answer is **D: Yon plato kodenn boukannen** (A platter of cocoa beans).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ancient Romans didn't have cocoa beans. Cocoa beans are the raw ingredient used to make chocolate, which wasn't available to the Romans.

Let's look at why the other options *were* part of ancient Roman feasts:

* **A: Envite pòv yo manje sou chèz** (Poor guests eating on chairs): The passage mentions that poor people didn't have chairs while dining, while the wealthy did.
* **B: Yon aperitif krapo** (A grape appetizer): The passage lists grapes as part of the food enjoyed by Romans.
* **C: Gason rich ki kouche pandan dine** (Rich men lying down during dinner): The passage describes wealthy Romans reclining while eating.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa gen anpil chans pou gen yon enpak dirab?","The correct answer is **B: Yon kilti minè**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kilti minè yo souvan disparèt san yo pa kite prèv istorik enpòtan sa ki vin fe yo pa rekonèt yo kòm sivilizasyon."" (Minor cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence of what they did, so they are not recognized as civilizations.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yon sosyete:** The passage describes a civilization as a large group of people working together, which *is* a society. So, a society is a component *of* a civilization, not something that lacks the potential for a lasting impact in the same way a minor culture does.
* **C: Yon vil-eta:**  The passage says city-states are ancestors of nations. They are a significant part of the development of civilizations.
* **D: Yon kilti sivilizasyon:** The passage defines a civilization as having a lasting cultural imprint. Therefore, a civilization *does* have the potential for a lasting impact.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki anvan yon nasyon?","The correct answer is **C: Yon vil-eta**.

The passage states: ""Vil Leta yo se zansèt nasyon yo."" This translates to ""City-states are the ancestors of nations."" Therefore, according to the passage, a city-state existed before a nation.
"
Ki deklarasyon sou Drukgyal Dzong ki pa vre?,"The incorrect statement is **A: Li te konstwi pou selebre viktwa fòs Tibeten-Mongòl yo** (It was built to celebrate the victory of Tibetan-Mongol forces).

The provided text clearly states the opposite: ""Yo di an 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel kreye yon fòtrès pou li ka **selebre viktwa li sou fòs tibeten-Mongol yo**."" (It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created a fortress to **celebrate his victory over Tibetan-Mongol forces**.)

Therefore, option A is false because it claims the fortress was built to celebrate the victory of the *Tibetan-Mongol* forces, whereas the text says it was built to celebrate *Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's* victory *over* them.

The other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Li sitiye nan Bhutan** - The text says it's in the Paro district of Bhutan.
*   **C: Yon dife te detwi anpil nan relik fòtrès la** - The text mentions a fire in 1951 that left only some relics.
*   **D: Se Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ki te kreye li** - The text explicitly states that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress.



"
Ki deklarasyon ki dekri avèk presizyon rezilta dife a nan Drukgyal Dzong lan?,"The correct answer is **A: Sèl relik ki rete a se imaj Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.**

The passage states: ""Aprè dife an, sèlman kèk relik Drukgyal Dzong yo rete tankou imaj Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel."" This directly supports option A.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fòs Tibeten-Mongòl yo te ranpòte laviktwa:** The passage says Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to *celebrate* his victory, not that the Mongol forces won.
*   **C: Popilarite atraksyon an pa te afekte:** The passage explicitly states the fire left only a few relics, indicating a significant impact on the dzong.
*   **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel te konsève li:** While Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was involved in the dzong's creation, the passage discusses the *aftermath* of the fire."
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo sou Kanmbòdj ki vre?,"The correct answer is **D: Thai yo te detwi Phnom Phen**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tayis yo te anvayi Kanmbòdj plizyè fwa nan 18tyèm syèk la epi an 1772, yo te detwi Phnom Phen."" (The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772, they destroyed Phnom Penh.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vyetnamyen yo te detwi Phnom Phen** - The passage states the *Thai* destroyed Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.
* **B: Kanmbòdj te anvayi Taylann an 1772** - The passage mentions Thai invasions of Cambodia, but doesn't mention Cambodia invading Thailand.
* **C: Vyetnamyen yo te anvayi Kanmbòdj nan kòmansman 18yèm syèk la** - The passage says the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia *later* in the 18th century, not at the beginning.



"
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki dekri avèk presizyon envazyon Kanmbòdj yo?,"The best answer is **B: Thai yo ak Vyetnamyen yo te anvayi Kanmbòdj an 1772.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""Tayis yo te anvayi Kanmbòdj plizyè fwa nan 18tyèm syèk la epi an 1772, yo te detwi Phnom Phen. Nan dènyè lane 18yèm syèk la vietnamyen yo anvayi Kanmbòdj tou.""
* **Option B accurately reflects this information:** It mentions both the Thai and Vietnamese invasions and specifically points to the year 1772.
* **Other options are incomplete or inaccurate:**
    * A: Only mentions the Vietnamese invasions, not the Thai.
    * C: Only mentions the Vietnamese destruction of Phnom Penh, not the broader invasions.
    * D: Only mentions the Thai invasions, not the Vietnamese.

Therefore, option B is the only one that comprehensively and accurately describes the invasions of Cambodia during the 18th century as stated in the prompt.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo Dutch East India Company pa te fè pandan tan yo nan Taywann?,"The correct answer is **D: Dispoze sede kontwòl Taywann bay dinasti Qing lan.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.""  The Dutch East India Company did *not* hand over control to the Qing Dynasty.  They were conquered by the Qing.

Let's look at why the other options *were* things the Dutch East India Company did:

* **A: Gen yon baz sou pati sidwès zile a** - The text explicitly says: ""In 1624, Dutch East India Company set up a base in southwestern Taiwan...""
* **B: Pratike pwodiksyon sereyal otoktòn** - The text says: ""...initiated a practical transformation of the indigenous people's cereal production...""
* **C: Anplwaye travayè Chinwa nan plantasyon li yo** - The text says: ""...and employed Chinese workers to work in the rice and sugar plantations.""



"
Kisa Trete Shimonoseki an te etabli?,"The correct answer is **D: Otorite Japon sou Taywann**.

The text states: ""Nan 1895, aprè defèt sa nan premye gè sino japonèz lan (1894-1895) gouvènman Qing lan siyen trete Shimonoseki, selon trete sa li bay souvrènte sou Taywonn ak **Japon**, k ap dirije jous an 1945.""

Therefore, the treaty granted Japan authority over Taiwan.
"
Kijan yo mezire nivo pH yon pwodui chimik?,"The correct answer is **B: Kantite pwoton ki genyen nan pwodui chimik la**.

Here's why:

* **pH is defined as a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution.**  A lower pH indicates a higher concentration of H+ (more acidic), and a higher pH indicates a lower concentration of H+ (more basic/alkaline). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nan ki pwen pwodui chimik la baz oswa asid:** This is a qualitative description, not a quantitative measurement. While pH tells you if something is acidic or basic, it doesn't tell you *how much*.
* **C: Kantite yon idwojèn nan pwodui chimik la:**  This is not accurate. pH specifically refers to the *hydrogen ions (H+)*, not just the hydrogen atoms themselves.
* **D: Kantite elektwon ki genyen nan pwodui chimik la:**  Electrons are not directly related to pH. pH is about the concentration of hydrogen ions.



"
Kisa yo te retire nan yon idwojèn lan?,"The correct answer is **D: Elektwon yo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yon idwojèn yo se pwoton yo ki te retire elektwon li yo...""  This directly indicates that electrons were removed from a hydrogen atom to create a hydrogen ion (proton).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pwoton yo:** While hydrogen ions *are* protons, the question asks what was *removed* *from* the hydrogen.  The passage specifies electrons.
* **B: pH:** pH is a measure of acidity/alkalinity, not a part of the hydrogen ion itself.
* **C: Alkalen:** Alkalinity is a property of a solution, not something removed from the hydrogen ion.
"
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki pa dekri avèk presizyon yon fyète lyon?,"The correct answer is **B: Rapò mal/femèl pa egal (The male/female ratio is not equal)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Fyète yo fèt ak twa mal granmoun nan menm fanmi, epi yon trantèn femèl ak ti ous yo."" This means there are 3 males and 30 females.  Therefore, the male/female ratio *is* unequal.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate according to the text:

*   **A: Yo konpòte yo menm jan ak gwoup chen (They behave like a pack of dogs):** The passage directly compares the Lyon pride to a pack of dogs in terms of behavior.
*   **C: Tout mal ak femèl yo fanmi de prè (All males and females are closely related):** The passage mentions that the females are closely related, forming a large sisterhood. While it doesn't explicitly say the males are closely related to each other, the family structure of a pride implies a close familial connection between the males as well.
*   **D: Yo alafwa mòtèl ak sosyal (They are both mortal and social):** The passage states that they can be mortal, and their behavior (like that of a pack of dogs) is indicative of a social structure.



Therefore, option B is the only one that contradicts the information presented in the text."
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki pa dekri avèk presizyon konpòtman lyon yo?,"The answer is **C: Ni mal ni femèl trè danjere pou bèt yo chase**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Fyète lyon aji menm jan ak yon gwoup chen, bèt ki parèy akj lyon (men pa tankou lòt gwo bèt) nan konpotman, ki ka motèl tou pou jibye yo."" This indicates the lions *are* dangerous for hunting.

Let's look at why the other options *are* described in the text:

* **A: Yo trè sosyal:** The text says they live in a large group called a ""fyète,"" which implies a very social structure.
* **B: Konpòtman yo konparab ak konpòtman lou yo:**  The text directly states this comparison: ""bèt ki parèy akj lyon (men pa tankou lòt gwo bèt)"".
* **D: Konpòtman yo menm jan ak lòt gwo chat yo:** The text implies this by saying they are ""bèt ki parèy akj lyon"", which are big cats.  While not explicitly stating they are *like* other big cats, it is a reasonable implication.



"
Ki tip predatè ki chase lapen yo kouraman?,"The correct answer is **C: Chat gwosè mwayen yo**.

The passage states: ""Anba yo gen anpil chat ki gen gwosè mwayen k ap manje predatè ki gen gwosè mwayen sòti nan lapen yo ale nan antilòp yo ak sèf yo."" This translates to: ""Below there are many medium-sized cats eating medium-sized predators ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer."" This directly indicates that medium-sized cats are the ones preying on rabbits.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo pi piti chat souvan chase?,"The correct answer is **A: Wonjè yo**.

The passage states: ""...gen anpil ti chat yo (gen ladan yo chat konpayi an libète yo) ki manje ti predatè yo pi plis tankou zwazo yo, ensèk yo, **wonjè yo** ak leza yo."" This indicates that small cats often hunt rodents.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa fè pati metòd lachas yon oselo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kamouflaj nan anviwònman li**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ocelots use scent to find prey and hunt deer by ambushing them. 
* While ocelots have good night vision, the passage doesn't mention them specifically *following* prey at night. It emphasizes their night vision for hunting *in general*.
* The passage describes ocelots hunting a variety of animals, not just smaller ones.
* The passage *doesn't* mention camouflage as a hunting method. It focuses on their scent tracking, night vision, and ambush tactics.

Therefore, camouflage isn't mentioned as a method the ocelot uses according to the text.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa dekri yon oselo avèk presizyon? ,"The correct answer is **A: Yo kapab lachas byen lannwit (They can hunt well at night)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ocelots have excellent night vision (""byen nan fènwa avèk vizyon lannwit la""), but it doesn't explicitly say they *hunt well* at night. It just mentions their night vision.
*   The passage *does* say they move silently (""deplase an silans""), follow scents (""pran sant""), and prefer to hunt small animals (""pito lachas ti bèt"").

Therefore, option A is the least accurate description of an ocelot based *solely* on the information provided in the text.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa ta konsidere kòm pi gwo fòs yon tig?,"The correct answer is **A: Rijisman**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that a tiger's pulling strength is five times stronger than a human's.
* While tigers can climb, jump, and swim, those are described as abilities, not their *greatest* strength.
* The text details the unique nature of a tiger's roar, differentiating it from a lion's roar. This suggests that the roar isn't their primary defining characteristic or greatest strength. 

Therefore, the roar (rijisman) is the least likely to be considered the tiger's *greatest* strength, especially when compared to its exceptional pulling power.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki yon diferans ant tig ak lyon?","The correct answer is **B: Son rijisman yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Rijisman tig lan pa menm jan ak rijisman ak plen vwa yon lyon...pito tankou yon fraz mo k ap mòde epi kriye."" This directly contrasts the sound of a tiger's roar with a lion's.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kapasite yo pou naje:** The passage mentions tigers can swim, but it doesn't say this is different from lions.
* **C: Distans yo sote:** The passage mentions tigers can jump long distances, but it doesn't say this is different from lions.
* **D: Fòs yo rale:** The passage states tigers can pull with five times the strength of a human, but it doesn't compare this to lions.

"Dapre pasaj la, kisa Robert Hooke te fè anvan lòt byolojis yo?","The correct answer is **A: Obsève selil ki mouri yo**.

The passage states: ""Li te premye moun ki obsève selil ki mouri yo."" which translates to ""He was the first person to observe dead cells.""
"
Kisa orijin mo “selil” vle di?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti pyès**.

The passage states: ""Selil sòti nan mo laten ki siyifi ti pyès."" which translates to ""Cell comes from the Latin word meaning small piece.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, pifò bèt yo gen kapasite pou yo fè kisa?","The correct answer is **B: Deplase**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anpil bèt ka deplase."" This translates to ""Many animals can move."" While the passage mentions digging, swimming, and flying as things animals do, it says ""many"" can move, making ""move"" the most accurate and encompassing answer. The passage doesn't say *pifò* (most) animals fly, swim, or dig.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa kèk bèt pa genyen?","The correct answer is **C: Sèvo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sèlman bèt yo ki gen yon sèvo (menm si tout bèt yo pa genyen; medis yo pa egzanp, pa gen yon sèvo)."" This means not all animals have brains.
"
Kisa ki ede plant yo nan pwosesis fotosentèz la?,"The correct answer is **D: Solèy**.

The passage states that plants make their own food through photosynthesis *using sunlight*. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lonbraj (Shade):** Shade would hinder photosynthesis, not help it.
*   **B: Bèt yo (Animals):** Animals are dependent on plants, but they don't directly help with photosynthesis.
*   **C: Manje (Food):** Plants *produce* food through photosynthesis; they don't need food to perform the process."
Kisa moun ekspire ke plant yo enspire?,"The correct answer is **B: Oksijèn**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Plant yo fabrike pwòp manje yo apati solèy la p fotosentèz. Yo bay tou lonbraj. Nou fabrike kay nou apati plant yo epi rad nou apati plant yo. Majorite manje n ap manje se plant yo ye. San plant yo, bèt p ap kapab viv.""

The passage also mentions that plants ""absòbe di oksid kabòn imen yo lage (sa vle di degaje).""  This means plants take in carbon dioxide (the gas humans exhale).  As a result of photosynthesis, plants *release* oxygen.

Therefore, plants *inspire* (take in) carbon dioxide and *exhale* (release) oxygen.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan egzanp ki annapre la yo ki ta anpeche pwosesis evolisyon an?","The correct answer is **C: Yon popilasyon ki ajiste adaptasyon li nan yon nouvo anviwònman.**

Here's why:

The passage describes speciation as the process of new species forming due to populations adapting to different environments. Option C directly describes this adaptation, which *is* the process of evolution. Therefore, a population adapting to a new environment *doesn't* prevent evolution; it *is* evolution in action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yon ti gwoup ki pa pwospere nan yon nouvo kote:** While this might lead to extinction, it doesn't prevent evolution. Evolution is about adaptation, and even failure to adapt is a form of evolutionary outcome.
*   **B: Yon pòsyon nan yon popilasyon k ap deplase ale nan yon nouvo anviwònman:** This is the *starting point* of potential speciation, not a factor that prevents evolution.
*   **D: Yon popilasyon ki fòme de finalman:** This describes a population that has *already* diverged into a new species – the *result* of evolution, not something that prevents it.



"
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki pa dekri avèk presizyon pwosesis spesyasyon an? ,"The correct answer is **A: Li rive lè yon nouvo popilasyon pa kapab adapte** (It happens when a new population is unable to adapt).

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states that speciation *is* driven by adaptation to a new environment.** The passage says populations need to develop *different* characteristics and adaptations to survive in a new environment. If a new population *couldn't* adapt, it wouldn't eventually diverge into a new species.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate according to the passage:

* **B: Se yon aspè enpòtan nan pwosesis evolisyon an** (It's an important aspect of the evolutionary process): The passage explicitly states this.
* **C: Li refere a fòmasyon yon nouvo espès** (It refers to the formation of a new species): The passage defines speciation as the formation of new species.
* **D: Aparisyon li inevitab** (Its appearance is inevitable): The passage calls speciation ""a consequence that is inevitable.""



"
Ki pati nan sistèm sikilasyon an ki pote san nan direksyon kè a?,"The correct answer is **A: Atè yo** (The arteries).

The passage states: ""San soti nan tib yo rele atè epi li retounen nan kè a nan tib yo rele venn."" (Blood leaves the tubes called arteries and returns to the heart through tubes called veins.)
"
Ki tib ki pi piti nan sistèm sikilasyon an?,"The correct answer is **A: Kapiyè yo**

The passage states: ""Tib ki pi piti yo rele kapiyè."" which translates to ""The smallest tubes are called capillaries.""
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo kapasite yon ensèk pou repliye zèl li ogmante?,"The correct answer is **B: Espas pou kache (Space to hide)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to fold wings allows insects to ""ba yo yon pi gwo kantinte ti kote pou kache pou predatè yo"" (give them a larger amount of small space to hide from predators).  Therefore, the ability to fold wings directly relates to having more hiding space.

The other options are related to insects but not the *direct* result of wing-folding:

*   **A: Apwovizyònman manje (Food supply):**  While important for survival, wing-folding doesn't directly affect the food supply.
*   **C: Jwenn konpayon (Finding companions):**  Wing-folding helps with evasion, but isn't directly about finding mates.
*   **D: Vitès vòl (Flight speed):**  Wing-folding doesn't inherently increase flight speed; it's about compacting the wings.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa mansyone nan pasaj la kòm yon bagay ki afekte kapasite yon ensèk pou l vole?,"The correct answer is **B: Dire lavi (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

* The passage focuses on how insect wings help with escape, finding food, and finding mates. It also mentions the ability to fold wings for protection.
* **Lifespan** is not discussed in the context of influencing the ability to fly. The other options are related:
    * **Reproduction** is indirectly linked as flight aids in finding mates.
    * **Finding food** is directly mentioned as a benefit of flight.
    * **Efficiency** is related to how well flight helps the insect survive.

Therefore, lifespan is the only option not mentioned in connection to how flight capability is affected by environmental factors or advantages.
"
Kilès nan karakteristik ki annapre la yo ki pa souvan asosye ak dinozò yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Mache sou janm dèyè (Walking on two legs)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that birds (which are considered modern-day dinosaurs) walk on two legs like a T-Rex.** While some dinosaurs walked on two legs, it wasn't a defining characteristic of *all* dinosaurs. The passage highlights this as something birds *do*, which is why it's presented as the least commonly associated trait.

* **Plum, laying eggs, and having feet with claws** are all traits frequently associated with both dinosaurs and birds, as mentioned in the passage.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa konsidere òdinèman kòm yon karakteristik komen kay zwazo ak dinozò?,"The correct answer is **C: Kapasite pou vole (Ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that many people don't consider birds dinosaurs *because* they can fly and have feathers.**  The passage then goes on to list characteristics birds *do* share with dinosaurs.
* **The other options (ponn ze, sèvi ak de janm dèyè yo pou mache, and pye ki gen grif) are all mentioned as characteristics shared between birds and dinosaurs.**

Therefore, the ability to fly is the one trait that differentiates birds from dinosaurs in the eyes of many people.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki pati nan yon plant sikad yon Triceratops ta gen anpil chans manje?","The correct answer is **A: Fèy ki pike yo (Spiky leaves)**.

The passage states: ""Triceratops yo ta ka sèvi ak bek solid li pou rache fèy yo avan li manje kò bwa a."" (Triceratops could use its solid beak to tear the leaves before eating the woody part.)
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo yon Triceratops ta gen plis chans pou manje? ","The best answer is **A: Yon parese**. Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lòt syantifik yo fè konnen plant sa yo toksik anpil epi li donk pa twò pwobab yon dinozò te manje yo, menm si jodi a parese a ak lòt bèt yo tankou jako (yon zansèt dinozò yo) kapab manje fèy yo oswa fwi toksik yo.""
* **This implies:** The passage suggests that animals *can* eat toxic plants, and that sloths (parese) are modern examples of animals that eat toxic leaves or fruits.
* **Why the other options are less likely:**
    * **B: Yon plant ki gen branch di:** The passage explicitly says Triceratops could break branches, but the main point is the plant itself might be toxic.
    * **C: Yon jako:** While the passage mentions sloths (parese) and sloths are related to dinosaurs, it doesn't directly say a *current* sloth is the *most* likely ancestor to have eaten this specific plant.
    * **D: Yon plant ki gen fwi toksik:** The passage mentions toxic plants in general, but doesn't specifically say that Triceratops would eat plants *with fruits*.



Therefore, the answer is **A: Yon parese**."
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan espò ki annapre la yo ki gen anpil chans pou li trè popilè nan rejyon ki pi nan nò Itali?","The correct answer is **C: Planch sou nèj (Skiing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Espò ivè yo pi popilè nan rejyon Nò yo, kote italyen yo ap patisipe nan jwèt entènasyonal yo epi nan manifestasyon olenmpik yo.""

""Espò ivè yo"" translates to ""Winter sports"".  Of the choices provided, ""Planch sou nèj"" is the only winter sport listed.  The passage directly links winter sports popularity to the Northern region of Italy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Foutbòl (Football):** While football is popular in Italy, the passage doesn't specifically state it's *most* popular in the North, only that winter sports are.
*   **B: Volebòl (Volleyball):** Volleyball is listed as a popular sport, but there's no connection made to the Northern region in the passage.
*   **D: Kous oto F1 (Formula 1 Racing):** F1 racing is mentioned as a popular sport, but again, there's no specific link to Northern Italy.

Therefore, **Planch sou nèj (Skiing)** is the only option directly supported by the information in the passage."
"Dapre enfòmasyon yo bay nan pasaj la, kilès nan espò ki annapre la yo ki te ranpòte yon chanpyona mondyal pou Itali?","The correct answer is **A: Foutbòl**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Foutbòl nasyonal Itali ak ekip nasyonal alman se dezyèm ekip ki gen plis siksè nan mond la, yo te ranpòte koup di mond FIFA an 2006.""  This directly links Italian national football to winning the World Cup.
"
Apre ki evènman sèten pati nan Liksanbou te vin Bèlj?,"The correct answer is **B: Revolisyon Bèlj la**.

The text states: ""Rejyon aktyèl Bèljik yo te fè oparavan pati Lizanmbou men yo te vin bèlj aprè Revolisyon bèlj nan lane 1830 yo."" (The current region of Belgium used to be part of Luxembourg, but it became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution in 1830.)
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki te afekte netralite Liksanbou?,"The correct answer is **A: Okipasyon Alman**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Liksanbou toujou eseye rete yon peyi net men li te sou okupasyon pandan ni premye ak dezyem gè mondyal pa Almay."" This directly links the occupation by Germany to the violation of Luxembourg's neutrality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Antre nan Inyon Ewopeyèn:**  While joining the EU might have altered certain aspects of Luxembourg's sovereignty, the passage doesn't describe it as directly affecting its neutrality.
* **C: Revolisyon Bèlj la:** The Belgian Revolution led to Luxembourg becoming part of Belgium, not directly affecting its neutrality.
* **D: Vin yon peyi endepandan:** Becoming independent is the *opposite* of being occupied, and the passage says Luxembourg was trying to *remain* neutral.



"
Konbyen kilomèt kare sipèfisi total Tiki ye an Ewòp?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""Sipèfisi Tiki, lak yo ladanl se 783,562 kilomèt kare (300,948 sq mi), pami 755,688 kilomèt kare (291,773 sq mi) an Azi di Sidwès ak **23,764 kilomèt kare (9,174 sq mi) an Ewòp**.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, apeprè konbyen mil longè Tiki genyen?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Teritwa Tike a plis pase 1,600 kilomèt (1,000 mi) longè..."" which translates to ""The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) long...""
"
Pou kisa yo itilize lang Laten an nan vil Vatikan?,"The correct answer is **A: Seremoni relijye yo**.

The text states: ""tandiske yo plis sèvi ak laten nan seremoni relijye."" which translates to ""while they mostly use Latin in religious ceremonies.""
"
"Nan vil Vatikan, pou kisa yo pa itilize Italyen?","The correct answer is **C: Seremoni relijye yo**.

The text states that while Italian is used in legislation and official communication, Latin is primarily used in religious ceremonies.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki benefisye nan melanj son sou òdinatè sofistike?","The correct answer is **A: Mizik**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Muzik souvan anrejistre avèd èd òdinatè sofistike pou trete epi melanje son yo."" (Music is often recorded with the help of sophisticated computers to treat and mix sounds.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Animasyon yo:** While computers are used for animation, the passage doesn't mention audio processing for animations.
* **C: Foto yo:** The passage doesn't mention audio processing for photos.
* **D: Konstriksyon:**  This is irrelevant to the passage, which focuses on image, video, and audio manipulation.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, nan ki kote ki te gen majorite kay ak twalèt ki ka flòch ak chas dlo?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage states: ""Arappa ak Moyenjo-daro te gen twalèt ak chas dlo nan prè ske tout kay yo ki te relye ak yon sistè m egou ki sofistike."" This directly translates to ""Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets and water closets near almost all houses which were connected to a sophisticated sewage system.""

The other options are mentioned as places where toilets existed, but the passage specifically highlights Mohenjo-daro as having toilets connected to a sophisticated sewage system in most homes.
"
Nan kilès nan kote ki annapre la yo ou te jwenn sistèm dlo egou avanse?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The passage explicitly states that Harappa (and Mohenjo-daro) had toilets and a sophisticated sewage system connected to most houses. The other options are mentioned as having toilets but not necessarily advanced sewage systems connected to individual homes.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki lakòz yon patinè vire?,"The correct answer is **A: Koub lejè a sou anba lam paten an.**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states that the curved underside of the blade is what causes the turn.  It explains that as the blade bends when leaning, the side in contact with the ice causes the turn.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kwen doub yo toutolon paten an (The double corners of the skate):** While the double corners *contribute* to the edge holding and turning, the curvature of the blade is the primary mechanism.
* **C: Nivo konpetans jeneral patinè a (The general skill level of the skater):** A skater's skill influences the *amount* of turn and control, but it's not the *cause* of the turn itself.
* **D: Kalite glas la (The quality of the ice):**  The ice quality affects how easily the blade grips, but the curvature is what initiates the turning action.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki dekri avèk presizyon kre ki sou lam yon paten glas modèn?","The correct answer is **C: Konkav**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the modern skate blade has a ""concave void between them."" The concave shape is what allows for the edge to catch the ice and facilitate turning when the skater leans.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kwen doub (Double edges):** While double edges exist, the passage focuses on the *concave* shape. The double edges are a feature *of* the blade, but not the primary mechanism described for turning.
* **B: Koube (Curved):** The curved underside of the blade is important, but the passage highlights the interaction of the *concave* with the ice.
* **D: Enkline (Inclined):**  While the blade *becomes* inclined when the skater leans, the passage doesn't describe the inclination itself as the core feature. It's the *concave* shape that enables the inclination to be used for turning.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki pwosesis ki pèmèt atòm yo elimine enèji ki depase nan limyè a?","The correct answer is **B: Stimilasyon emisyon foton**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Pou retounen nan nivo enèji yo te gen avan an, yo dwe debarase yo de enèji anplis yo te resevwa de limyè a. Yo fè l pandan y ap pwodwi yon ti patikil limyè ki rele """"foton"""". Syantifik yo rele pwosesis sa """"emisyon simile reyònman""""...""
* The passage defines ""emisyon simile reyònman"" as the process where atoms become excited by light, which causes the emission of a photon of light.
* Therefore, the process that allows atoms to eliminate excess energy from light is **stimulation of photon emission**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Radyasyon (Radiation):** While photons *are* a form of radiation, the passage specifically refers to the *process* of releasing them.
* **C: Foton (Photon):** A photon is the particle emitted, not the process of releasing it.
* **D: Stimilasyon emisyon radyasyon (Stimulation of radiation emission):** This is too general. The passage specifically mentions photons as the emitted particles.

"
Kisa ki lakòz yon atòm emèt yon foton?,"The correct answer is **A: Lage enèji ki depase**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Pou retounen nan nivo enèji yo te gen avan an, yo dwe debarase yo de enèji anplis yo te resevwa de limyè a."" This directly translates to atoms needing to release excess energy they absorbed from light. This excess energy is released in the form of a photon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Stimilasyon limyè klere lakòz:** While light *stimulates* the atom, it's the *resulting excess energy* that's released.
* **C: Nivo enèji enstab:**  The passage doesn't say atoms become unstable. It explains they have an excess of energy that needs to be released to return to a stable state.
* **D: Yon reyaksyon negatif ak radyasyon:** The passage describes a positive process - releasing excess energy - not a negative reaction. ""Radyasyon"" is a general term for energy emitted, and while photons are a form of radiation, the cause is the excess energy, not the radiation itself.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki pral alafen lakòz yon anpoul limyè sispann travay?","The correct answer is **C: Filaman an andedan anpoul la boule**.

The passage states: ""ti fil nan anpoul la boule"". This directly indicates that the filament inside the light bulb burned out, causing it to stop working.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aparèy limyè a pa etenn kòrèkteman:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Lè baz metal anpoul la nan douy la pasyèlman sèlman:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Flo elektrisite nan douy la ralanti:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki ta ka danjere si w manyen l pandan w ap ranplase yon anpoul limyè?,"The correct answer is **C: Baz anpoul la**.

Here's why:

* **Baz anpoul la (the bulb base)** is the part that connects to the socket and is made of metal. It can conduct electricity and pose a shock hazard if touched while the power is on.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly dangerous:

* **Filaman an (the filament)** is inside the bulb and not directly accessible or a primary source of shock.
* **Switch limyè a (the light switch)** is where you control the power, and it should be turned *off* before you start working.
* **Kab la (the cord)** can be dangerous if damaged, but the primary risk during bulb replacement is touching the metal parts of the socket.



Therefore, touching the metal base of the light bulb while it's connected to power is the most direct and significant shock hazard.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki rive lè yon nwayo divize?","The correct answer is **B: Enèji libere**.

The passage states: ""Separasyon nwayo a yon lòt fwa libere yon pati nan enèji a."" (Separation of the nucleus releases a part of the energy).

The passage also mentions that nuclear fission occurs when a nucleus splits, and this splitting releases energy.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki reflete apèl long distans yo tounen desann sou Latè,"The correct answer is **B: Satelit yo (Satellites)**.

Here's why:

*   The question states that satellites are used to relay long-distance calls. Satellites are specifically designed to receive signals from Earth and then retransmit them back down to Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Teleskòp yo (Telescopes):** Telescopes are used to observe space, not to relay calls.
*   **C: Limyè yo (Light):** Light travels through space and is affected by the atmosphere, but it doesn't relay calls.
*   **D: Wòkèt yo (Rockets):** Rockets are used to launch satellites and telescopes into space, but they don't relay calls.



"
Kilès nan ki annapre la yo ke yo itilize pou mete yon teleskòp nan lespas?,"The correct answer is **B: Wòkèt yo (Rockets)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yo te itilize yon fize pou lanse satelit la nan lespas."" (They used a rocket to launch the satellite into space.)
* **Rockets are the primary vehicles used to launch objects, including telescopes, into space.** They generate the necessary thrust to overcome Earth's gravity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Feso limyè (Light beam):** Light beams are used for communication or scientific experiments, not for launching objects into space.
* **C: Atmosfè Latè (Earth's atmosphere):** The atmosphere is what rockets need to *escape*, not something used to launch them.
* **D: Satelit plis pase 100 pye wotè (Satellite more than 100 feet tall):** While a satellite of that height *could* be launched with a rocket, the satellite itself isn't the launching mechanism.



"
Kisa ki ta dwe note apwopo yon evènman siklik pou swiv pasaj tan an?,"The correct answer is **B: Repetisyon**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""You can mark the passage of time by observing the repetition of a cyclical event.""  A cyclical event *is* defined by its repetition.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Dire (Duration):** While duration is *part* of an event, it's not the key factor for *measuring* the passage of time through cyclical events.
* **C: Efè (Effect):** The effect of an event isn't directly related to marking time.
* **D: Difikilte (Difficulty):** The difficulty of an event has no bearing on the measurement of time.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki aspè nan yon evènman yo itilize tan pou konpare l?","The correct answer is **A: Longè (Length)**.

The passage states: ""Tan an, se tou fason nou konpare dire a (longè a) evènman yo."" This directly translates to: ""Time is also a way we compare the duration (length) of events.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly says that time is used to compare the *length* of events.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki konsidere kòm òdinè pou yon eritye twòn?","The correct answer is **B: Kite inivèsite pou antre nan lame**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Selon tradisyon an, eritye twòn lan ta ale dirèkteman nan lame aprè li tèmine etid li."" (According to tradition, an heir to the throne would go directly to the army after completing their studies.)

Option B directly reflects this traditional path.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pran yon diplòm 2:2:** While Charles achieved this, the passage highlights that this was *unusual* for an heir to the throne, not typical.
*   **C: Etidye Istwa:** Charles studied History, but the passage doesn't indicate this was a required or traditional step.
*   **D: Ale nan inivèsite anvan li antre nan lame:** The tradition was to go *directly* to the army *after* studies, not to go to university first.



"
"Dapre enfòmasyon yo bay nan pasaj la, kisa Charles te premye ki fè l?","The correct answer is **C: Pran yon diplòm**.

The passage states: ""Charles te premye manm fanmi wayal britanik lan ki te gen yon diplòm."" (Charles was the first member of the British royal family to have a degree.)
"
Nan ki peyi flòt Trygvasson an te soti?,"The correct answer is **D: Nòvèj**.

The text explicitly states: ""Flot sa te dirije pa Olaf Trygvasson, yon Nòvejyen..."" which translates to ""This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian...""
"
Nan ki epòk nan listwa Almay te egzèse yon gwo enfliyans kiltirèl sou Estoni?,"The correct answer is **C: Apeprè 600 ane de sa**.

Here's why: The passage states the influence of German culture on Estonia was during the 15th century and that it was the beginning of the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment period generally spanned from the 17th to the 18th centuries. 15th century to the 17th century is around 200 years, 15th century to the 18th century is around 250 years. The given options are: 200, 400, 600, and 800. 600 years of influence aligns best with the timeframe mentioned in the passage.
"
Kisa ki te enfliyanse lang Estonyen an?,"The correct answer is **B: Alfabè Alman an**.

The text states that the Old Estonian language was based on the German alphabet, and the character ""Õ/õ"" was added. While German culture influenced Estonia, and German settlers were involved, the *alphabet* itself was the direct influence on the language's written form.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kantite moun ki pale Endi natifnatal varye selon ki faktè?","The correct answer is **A: Si yo konte dyalèk ki sanble anpil ak Endi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kantite moun ki pale lang matènèl la varye selon nou konte oswa pa dyalèk ki pwòch anpil yo."" (The number of native speakers varies depending on whether we count dialects that are very close to Hindi.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Si yo konte moun ki pale Oudou yo** - While the passage mentions Hindi and Urdu are similar, it doesn't say the number of Hindi speakers depends on Urdu speakers.
* **C: Si yo konte moun ki ka konprann lang lan** - The passage mentions that up to 800 million people *can understand* Hindi, but the number of *speakers* varies depending on dialect counting.
* **D: Si yo konte moun ki ka li lang yo** - The passage doesn't mention reading ability as a factor in estimating the number of speakers.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki se yon deklarasyon vre sou lang Endi ak Oudou?,"The correct answer is **D: Yo diferan nan vokabilè**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Endi ak Idiyo sanble nan vokabile yo men yo diferan nan fason yo ekri..."" (Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but differ in how they are written...)
* **Option D directly reflects this.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Anjeneral gen yon dekoneksyon ant moun ki pale toude lang yo:** The text says they *can* understand each other in everyday speech, contradicting this.
* **B: Yo diferan nan tèks:** The text explicitly states they differ in *writing*, not necessarily in text.
* **C: Yo sanble nan ni vokabilè ni tèks:** The text says they *are* similar in vocabulary.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa yon reyalite egzat sou alfabè Hangeul la?,"The correct answer is **D: Yo te envante l toutespre (It was invented just like that)**.

Here's why:

* **A: Li te envante nan kòmansman rèy Wa Sejong (It was invented at the beginning of King Sejong's reign)** - The text states it was invented in 1444 *during* King Sejong's reign, so it's accurate.
* **B: Non orijinal alfabè a te Hunan Jeongeum (The original name of the alphabet was Hunmin Jeongeum)** - The text explicitly says this, so it's accurate.
* **C: Se katriyèm wa Dinasti Joseon an ki te envante l (He was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty who invented it)** - The text confirms this, so it's accurate.
* **D: Yo te envante l toutespre (It was invented just like that)** - This is incorrect. The text implies a process of invention and naming, not something that happened spontaneously. It was a deliberate creation.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that doesn't align with the information provided in the text.
"
Alfabè Hunmin Jeongeum te finalman chanje vin kisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states: ""Li te dabò nome alfabè Hangeul la Hunmin Jeongeum..."" which means the alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum eventually became Hangeul.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki lang ki te enfliyanse ak Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **D: Lang Endyen yo**.

The passage states: ""Sanskrit se yon lang ki difisil anpil epi ki rich, ki te sèvis sous ak anpil lang endyèn modèn..."" (Sanskrit is a very difficult and rich language that served as a source for many modern Indian languages...).

While the passage mentions Latin as a comparable ancient language, it specifically highlights the influence on modern Indian languages. Therefore, option D is the most accurate.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, akòz kisa itilizasyon Sanskrit te diminye?","The correct answer is **D: Yerachi**.

The passage states: ""Aprè konpilasyon Upanishads yo, sanskrit la te senpman efase akoz yerachi a."" This translates to ""After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit was simply erased because of the caste system.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Konpleksite (Complexity):** While the passage mentions Sanskrit is a difficult and rich language, it doesn't directly say that its complexity caused its decline.
*   **B: Migrasyon aryen (Aryan migration):** The passage mentions the Aryan migration as a theory *about* the origin of Sanskrit, not as a reason for its decline.
*   **C: Lang laten yo (Latin languages):** The passage compares Sanskrit to Latin, but it doesn't say Latin languages caused the decline of Sanskrit.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki se yon deklarasyon egzat konsènan gravite sou Io?","The correct answer is **D: Gravite Latè t ap rale plis sou ou pase gravite Io**.

Here's why:

The passage states that someone weighing 200 pounds on Earth weighs *less* on Io (36 pounds). This implies that Io's gravitational pull is weaker than Earth's. Therefore, Earth's gravity is pulling on you *more* than Io's gravity.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gravite Latè ta rale mwens sou ou pase gravite Io:** This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **B: Gravite Io rale plis, e se poutèt sa ou ta peze mwens:** This is incorrect. If Io's gravity were stronger, you'd weigh *more*.
* **C: Gravite Io rale plis, e se poutèt sa ou ta peze plis:** This is also incorrect for the same reason as B.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki dekri avèk presizyon kouch ekstèn Lalin nan?","The correct answer is **C: Ka gen mwens maria sou bò ki lwen an**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Li pi fen anba maria, epi pi epè anba highlands yo."" (It is thinnest under maria, and thicker under highlands).
* It also says: ""Li kapab gen plis maria sou arebò yo la paske kwout la pi fen."" (It may have more maria on the edges because the crust is thinner.)

This implies that the opposite is true - the *far side* (bò ki lwen an) has a thicker crust (and therefore potentially less maria) because the crust is thicker there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bò ki toupre a gen yon kwout ki pi epè:**  The passage says the far side has a thicker crust, not the ""always far side.""
* **B: Kwout la pi fen anba tè wo yo:** The passage says the crust is *thicker* under highlands.
* **D: Ka gen mwens maria anba tè wo yo:** The passage suggests that thicker crust (under highlands) might *lead to* more maria on the edges, implying the opposite - less maria under the highlands.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kikote kwout Lalin lan pi epè?","The correct answer is **C: Anba tè wo yo**.

The passage states: ""Li pi fen anba maria, epi pi epè anba highlands yo."" This translates to: ""It is thinnest under the maria, and thickest under the highlands."" Therefore, the crust is thickest under the highlands.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo kèk moun kwè?","The correct answer is **C: Lavi egziste sou lòt planèt yo (Life exists on other planets)**.

The passage states: ""...some believe that aliens or other life may live on another planet."" This directly supports option C.
"
Kisa ki vin pi fen amezi w ap deplase pi lwen sant Solèy la?,"The correct answer is **C: Gaz**.

The text states: ""Gaz la vin pi fen ofiamize w ap elwanye de sant Solèy la."" (The gas becomes increasingly rarefied as you move away from the center of the Sun.)
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki pati nan solèy la ki vizib apati Latè?","The correct answer is **C: Fotosfè a**.

The passage states: ""Pati deyò nou wè a lè n ap gade solèy la rele fotosfè, ki vle di """"boul limyè"""".""  This translates to ""The outer part we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which means 'sphere of light'.""
"
Kilès nan obsèvasyon ki annapre la yo ki te ede afime teyori Copernicus la?,"The correct answer is **A: Faz Venis yo (Phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **Galileo's observation of Venus's phases** was a key piece of evidence supporting Copernicus's heliocentric theory (the idea that planets orbit the Sun).  The phases of Venus are only possible if Venus orbits the Sun, just like the Moon orbits the Earth.  This couldn't be explained by the Earth-centered (geocentric) model.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yon tranzit Venis (Venus transit)** is also important evidence for the heliocentric model, but it came *after* the discovery of Venus's phases. While valuable, the phases were the earlier and more direct support.
* **C: Resanblans Solèy la ak Venis (Resemblance of the Sun and Venus)**  The resemblance of the Sun and Venus wasn't a significant factor in supporting Copernicus.
* **D: Resanblans Solèy la ak Lalin lan (Resemblance of the Sun and Earth)** Comparing the Sun and Earth doesn't directly relate to supporting Copernicus's theory.



Therefore, the phases of Venus were the initial observation that provided strong evidence for the heliocentric model."
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo Galileo Galilei te obsève an 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Faz Venis yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Anviwon twa mil an apre, nan lane 1610, astwonòm Italyen Galileyo Galileyi te itilize yon teleskòp pou l te obsève Venis gen faz, menm jan lalin genyen an."" This directly confirms that he observed the phases of Venus in 1610.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yon bò nan Lalin nan ki fè fas ak Solèy la:** While the passage mentions Venus's phases are due to only one side of Venus facing the Sun, Galileo observing *which* side was facing the Sun wasn't the primary observation in 1610. The phases themselves were the key discovery.
*   **C: Planèt la k ap vire toutotou Solèy la:**  The passage mentions that the phases of Venus supported Copernicus's theory, but Galileo didn't *observe* the planet orbiting the sun in 1610. The phases provided evidence *for* the orbiting theory, not the observation of the orbit itself.
*   **D: Yon tranzit Venis:**  Jeremiah Horrocks observed a Venus transit in 1639, *after* Galileo's observations. The passage states Galileo did *not* observe a Venus transit.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, apati kikote Flèv Amazon lan kolekte dlo?","The correct answer is **A: Flèv ki pi piti yo** (The smallest rivers).

The passage states: ""Li pran dlo nan men plizyè milye ti flèv"" which translates to ""It takes water from several thousand small rivers.""
"
Ki distenksyon yo pa atribye ba Flèv Amazon lan?,"The correct answer is **C: Se flèv ki pi long lan**

Here's why:

The passage states:

*   ""Rivyè Amazòn se dezyèm pi long ak pi gwo rivyè sou Latè."" (The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth.)
*   ""Amazòn se flèv ki pi laj sou latè..."" (The Amazon is the widest river on Earth...)

This means the Amazon is *not* the longest river. It's the second longest.  The other options (A, B, and D) are all facts stated in the passage about the Amazon."
Ki branch travay ki mansyone nan pasaj la ki anplwaye mwens kantite Venezyelyen?,"The correct answer is **C: Petwòl**.

The passage states: ""De tyè venezyelyen k ap travay fè l nan sektè sèvis lan, prèske yon ka nan endistri a epi en senkyèm nan agrikilti a."" This implies that the percentage of Venezuelan workers in the oil industry is less than the percentages in the service and industry sectors. While oil is important, it's only ""yon pousan"" (a percentage) of the overall labor force.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sektè ki annapre la yo ki anplwaye pi gwo kantite Venezyelyen?","The correct answer is **A: Sèvis (Services)**.

The passage states: ""De tyè venezyelyen k ap travay fè l nan sektè sèvis lan..."" which translates to ""Two-thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the service sector..."" This indicates that the service sector employs the largest number of Venezuelans.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa fizyon pèmèt zetwal yo fè?","The correct answer is **A: Fòme eleman ki pi lou**.

The passage states: ""Zetwal bay limyè ak chalè lè atòm idwojèn yo fizyone (oswa kole) ansanm yo fòme eleman ki pi lou."" (Stars give off light and heat when hydrogen atoms fuse (or join) together to form heavier elements.)

The passage doesn't mention anything about building fusion reactors (B), releasing light and heat (C) *as a result of fusion*, or creating hydrogen atoms (D).
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo yon retaktè fizyon itil ta ka kreye?,"The correct answer is **B: Etwal (Stars)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that stars produce energy through nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms.**  This is the process being replicated in a fusion reactor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Idwojèn (Hydrogen):** Hydrogen is a fuel source for fusion, not a reactor itself.
* **C: Atòm (Atoms):**  While fusion involves atoms, the question asks *who* would create a fusion reactor.
* **D: Enèji (Energy):** Energy is the *result* of fusion, not the creator of a fusion reactor.



"
Kisa konpozisyon chimik dlo ye?,"The correct answer is **D: De atòm idwojèn ak yon atòm oksijèn**.

The text states: ""Dlo a se yon lòt egzanp. Dlo konpoze avèk de atom idwojèn epi yon atom oksijèn."" (Water is another example. Water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.)
"
"Lè dlo chanje fòm, kisa ki pral rete menm jan?","The correct answer is **A: Estrikti molekilè**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Menmsi eta fizik li ta ka chanje, eta chimik li rete menm jan an.""  The chemical state is determined by the molecular structure.
* **Molecular structure:** Water (H2O) always has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, regardless of whether it's a gas, liquid, or solid. This consistent structure defines its chemical identity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dansite:** The passage mentions that liquid water is heavier than gaseous water, indicating that density *does* change with the state of water.
* **C: Eta fizik:** The passage states that the state of water *can* change (gas, liquid, solid).
* **D: Azòt likid:** The passage uses water as an example and doesn't relate it to liquid nitrogen. This option is irrelevant to the question.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa te yon pwoblèm pou trèz Eta yo lè yo t ap eseye enpoze sèten lwa?","The correct answer is **C: Amannman ki mande apwobasyon inanim.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Atik yo te egzije konsantman inanim tout eta yo anvan yo te modifye l..."" This means that getting agreement from all thirteen states was incredibly difficult, making it nearly impossible to pass any laws or taxes effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gwo sipèvizyon nan men otorite leta yo:** The passage states that the central government was *weak* and couldn't enforce laws effectively because the states weren't cooperating.  So, there wasn't *great* oversight from the state authorities, but rather a lack of it.
* **B: Yon mank pouvwa andedan Kongrè a:** The passage does mention a lack of power within the Congress (no power to tax, no executive or judicial branches), but the *requirement for unanimous consent* was a bigger, more direct problem for enacting laws.
* **D: Yon egzekitif nasyonal ki pa egziste:** The passage says there was no national executive branch, which contributed to the weakness of the central government, but again, the unanimous consent requirement was a more fundamental hurdle.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki deklarasyon ki reflete avèk presizyon eta gouvènman santral la pandan Gè Revolisyonè a?","The best answer is **C: Reprezantan Eta te manke yon prezans.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""eta yo pat pran gouvènman santral la oserye ke reprezantan yo te souvan absan.""  This directly addresses the lack of presence of state representatives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kongrè a ak otorite leta yo te aplike taks:** The passage clearly says the Congress *didn't* have the power to impose taxes.
* **B: Amannman nan Atik yo te depann de otorite Kongrè a:** While amendments *could* be changed according to Article, the passage focuses on the lack of trust in the central government's authority, not on amendment procedures.
* **D: Gouvènman santral la te gen de eleman prensipal:** The passage only mentions the Congress as a component. It states that there was no executive or judicial branch.

Therefore, option C is the only one accurately reflecting the weakness and lack of authority of the central government during the Revolutionary War, as described in the passage."
Kijan yo ekri mo ki sou do Deklarasyon Endepandans lan?,"The correct answer is **A: An gwo karaktè (In large characters)**.

The text states: ""Tèks la figire nan pati anba dokiman an, alanvè."" This indicates the text was located on the back of the Declaration of Independence. It also implies it was written in a noticeable way, and ""in large characters"" is the most likely way such a note would have been inscribed. The other options are not suggested by the text.



"
Pou kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo Sengapou selèb?,"The correct answer is **A: Vejetasyon lavil yo (City vegetation)**.

The text states that Singapore's botanical expertise contributed to transforming the island into a tropical garden city. Vanda Miss Joaquim being named the national flower further reinforces this point. Therefore, Singapore is famous for its city vegetation.
"
Kisa ki Vanda Miss Joaquim lan?,"The correct answer is **B: Yon flè (A flower)**.

The text explicitly states that Vanda Miss Joaquim is a ""melanj flè"" which translates to a flower hybrid. The passage also mentions it being chosen as the national flower.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki kalite nan piramid Gizeh yo ki pa te gen chans pou fè Ejipsyen Nouvo Wayòm lan sezi?","The correct answer is **D: Konstriksyon yo (Their construction)**.

The passage states that even though the New Kingdom Egyptians continued building pyramids, they couldn't surpass the construction of the Giza pyramids in height and technical excellence. Therefore, it was the **construction** that the New Kingdom Egyptians couldn't match.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kikote bèt ki manje manje fèy yo vwayaje soti nan pouswit lapli yo?","The correct answer is **B: Kolin nò yo**.

The passage states: ""Chak lane, ozalantou mwa oktòb, anviwon 1,5 milyon bèt ki manje fèy yo ap dirije yo nan plèn sid yo, pandan y ap travèse rivyè Mara, sòti nan **kolin nò yo** pou lapli yo."" 

This translates to: ""Each year, around October, about 1.5 million grazing animals migrate to the southern plains, while crossing the Mara River, coming from the **northern hills** for the rain.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, apati ki zòn bèt ki manje fèy yo pati kèk moman ozalantou avril?","The correct answer is **D: Rezèv Nasyonal Maasai Mara a**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: Chak lane, ozalantou mwa oktòb, anviwon 1,5 milyon bèt ki manje fèy yo ap dirije yo nan plèn sid yo... Epi retounen nan nò pandan ou pase nan lwès, yon lòt fwa wap travèse rivyè Mara aprè pil lapli Avril yo.""  This indicates that the herbivores cross the Mara River *after* the April rains, and the Mara River is part of the Maasai Mara National Reserve.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rejyon Serengeti an:** While the Serengeti is mentioned, the passage specifically links the April river crossing to the Maasai Mara.
*   **B: Plèn sid yo:** This is where the herbivores *go* during the October migration, not where they are when crossing the Mara River in April.
*   **C: Rivyè Mara a:** The river itself isn't a zone where the herbivores *start* from. They cross the river.

"
Envazyon ki peyi Operasyon Lyon Lanmè a te ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Grann Bretay**.

The passage states: ""Batay pou Lafrans lan tèmine, Almay t ap prepare pou anvayi zile **Grand Bretay** la."" (The battle for France was over, Germany was preparing to invade the island of Great Britain.)
"
Kòman Almay te rele atak sou Grann Bretay lan?,"The correct answer is **B: Operasyon Lyon Lanmè**.

The passage states: ""Almay te bay atak la non kòd “Operasyon Lyon lanmè”."" This translates to ""Germany gave the attack the code name 'Operation Sea Lion'.""
"
Kisa ki pa mansyone kòm yon etap nesesè nan plan Itali pou pran peyi Afriken yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Etabli yon ranp lansman twoup**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Italy needed to get rid of its ships and British bases in Egypt *to have a platform to deploy troops* to Africa. This implies a need for a staging area, but it doesn't specifically mention *establishing* a ramp for troop deployment. The focus is on removing existing obstacles to allow for troop deployment.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned:

*   **A: Debarase yo de bato an Ejip yo:** The passage directly mentions this as a necessary step.
*   **B: Konstwi bato siplemantè:** The passage says Italy was building ships *just before* the war, so it's implied they were doing this to bolster their fleet, even if it was a relatively small effort.
*   **D: Detwi baz Britanik yo:**  The passage states the need to be free from British bases in Egypt.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki te konsidere kòm objektif prensipal Itali nan lagè a?","The correct answer is **A: Kaptire peyi Afriken yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Objektif prensipal Itali se te peyi afriken yo."" (The main objective of Italy was the African countries.)
"
Ki moun ki te tabli relasyon amikal avèk anvayisè yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Franse Vichy**.

The passage states: ""Sa se fransè ki te fè lapè an 1940 avèk alman yo epi ki te travay avèk yo olye yo te goumen avèk yo."" (These are the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.) This directly refers to the Vichy government.
"
"""Kiyès alye yo ki te enplike nan """"Operation Dragoon"""" lan te ye?""","The correct answer is **A: Ameriken yo ak franse lib**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nan de semèn sèlman, ameriken ak fòs fransè lib yo te libere sid Lafrans..."" (In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated Southern France...)
"
Devlopman ki teknoloji ki te lakòz soumaren yo kòmanse vwayaje anba dlo?,"The correct answer is **C: Navigasyon**.

Here's why:

The text states that submarines were used in WWI and WWII, but their effectiveness was limited early on. The development of radar made surface travel dangerous because submarines could be easily detected. This led to submarines needing to travel underwater.  Therefore, advancements in **navigation** were crucial for submarines to be able to navigate effectively underwater and stay submerged for extended periods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U-Boats:** U-boats were a *type* of submarine, not the technology that enabled underwater travel in general.
*   **B: Chan pou tire (Firing gun):** While important for warfare, the ability to fire wasn't the primary reason submarines started traveling underwater.
*   **D: Rada (Radar):** Radar *forced* submarines to travel underwater, but it wasn't the technology that *enabled* them to do so. It was the *development of the ability to navigate effectively underwater* that made this possible in the first place.



"
"Pandan premye itilizasyon yo, nan ki domèn soumaren yo te gen yon pòte trè limite?","The correct answer is **C: Tire**.

The passage states: ""Lè sa a, yo te trè dousman e tir yo te trè limite."" This directly indicates that the range of firing capabilities (tir) was limited during the early uses of submarines.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès ki te vyole yon akò? ","The correct answer is **D: Sovyetik yo**.

The passage states: ""...plis pase 800,000 sòlda lame wouj Inyon sovyetik la te antre epi kreye fwontyè belarisyèn ak ikrenyèn lan aprè yo te anvayi rejyon oryantal Polòy yo...an vyolasyon trete lapè Riga a..."" 

This clearly indicates that the Soviet Union violated the Treaty of Riga. The passage also mentions the Soviets invaded eastern Poland.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo Lame Wouj la pa te fè?,"The correct answer is **C: Yon reyòganizasyon toutolon tèt pon an (A complete reorganization of the headland)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Polish defense was already broken and their only hope was a retreat and reorganization *behind* the Romanian front. This implies the reorganization was intended to happen *behind* the existing line.
* The passage explicitly says the Soviet Red Army invaded eastern regions of Poland, created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, and violated treaties (Riga and other international agreements).
* Therefore, a *complete reorganization of the headland* (the Polish defensive line) wasn't the action the Red Army took; they were focused on invasion and violating treaties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kreyasyon yon zòn batay Ikrenyen (Creation of a Ukrainian battle zone):** The passage states the Red Army *created* the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, which essentially *are* Ukrainian battle zones.
* **B: Yon envazyon nan rejyon lès yo (An invasion of the eastern regions):** The passage explicitly mentions the Red Army invaded eastern regions of Poland.
* **D: Yon vyolasyon trete (A violation of treaties):** The passage directly states the Red Army violated treaties like the Riga Peace Treaty.



"
Kisa ki te pase enjenyè an chèf dizyèm lame Italyen an?,"The correct answer is **C: Britanik yo te kaptire l**.

The text states: ""Yon anbiskad nan lès Bardia, Britanik yo te kaptire enjenyè an chèf dizyèm lame italyèn nan, jeneral Lastucci."" (In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the 2nd Italian Army, General Lastucci.)
"
Kikote yo te touye Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The passage states: ""28 jen, marechal Italo Balbo, gouvènè jeneral Libi epi eritye prezime Mussolini, te mouri ak bal zanmi lè debakman l nan Tobrouk.""  This directly indicates he was killed during the landing in Tobruk.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan teknik ki annapre la yo ki se yon pati enpòtan nan meditasyon Tibeten?","The correct answer is **C: Vizyalize divinite yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Gras ak vizyalizasyon divès divinite, kanal enèji yo netwaye, chakra yo aktive epi konsyans iliminasyon an kreye."" This directly links visualization of deities to a key aspect of Tibetan meditation.

While the other options (breathing exercises, mantras, and yoga postures) are mentioned as part of Kundalini Yoga, the passage specifically connects **visualizing deities** to the core of the Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice described.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kijan chakra yo aktive pandan “sant” meditasyon tibeten an?","The correct answer is **B: Avèk vizyalizasyon divinite yo**.

The passage states: ""Gras ak vizyalizasyon divès divinite, kanal enèji yo netwaye, chakra yo aktive epi konsyans iliminasyon an kreye."" This directly links the activation of chakras to visualization of deities.
"
Kilès ki te prezante dezyèm chante devosyonèl la pandan pwogram nan?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

The passage states: ""Chantez Sanju Sharma te kòmanse sware a, aprè te vin gen hankar Choudhary."" This translates to ""Singer Sanju Sharma started the evening, after which Jai Shankar Choudhary sang."" Therefore, Jai Shankar Choudhary presented the second devotional song.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kimoun ki te prezante yon chante devosyonèl pandan ofrann manje a?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The passage states: ""Aprè, Lakkha Singh te pran inisyativ pou chante bhajans yo. Yo te sèvi Baba Chyam 108 plat Chapan Bòg (nan Endouyis la, se 56 bagay komestib, tankou, sirèt, fwi, nwa, veso elatriye. yo ofri bay divinite yo). Lakkha Singh prezante chhappan bhog bhajan la tou. Chantè, Raju Khandelwal te akonpaye l."" This clearly indicates that Lakkha Singh performed devotional songs during the offering of food.
"
Kisa ki te avan dènye pèfòmans lan nan aswè a?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina ak Haris Alexiou**.

The passage states: ""Diva tik la Sezen Aksu te pèfòme avèk tenò italyen an Alessandro Safina ak chantè grèk la Haris Alexiou.""  This is directly before the Fire of Anatolia performance.
"
Ki nasyonalite Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Italyen**.

The text states Alessandro Safina is a ""tenor italyen,"" which translates to Italian tenor.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki pa vre?","The correct answer is **D: Sa te pran omwen 60 minit pou fè premye moun lan sòti nan manèj la**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Se te yon jounen cho nan Santa Clara avèk tanperati nan lane 90 yo. Nenpòt tan ou bloke montay ris ka rann ou pa konfòtab, se tout sa nou ka di, sa te pran **inèd tan** pou fè premye moun nan sòti nan manèj la.""  ""Inèd tan"" means a short amount of time. 60 minutes (1 hour) is much longer than ""inèd tan.""

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the passage:

* **A: Te gen yon dife nan Santa Clara** - The context of firefighters and a hot day strongly implies a fire.
* **B: Moun yo te kole sou yon montay ris** - The passage explicitly mentions blocking a fire escape.
* **C: Yo te bay pasaje yo dlo** - The passage directly states, ""Pasaje yo te rsevwa dlo..."" (Passengers were given water...).

Therefore, only option D contradicts the information provided in the passage.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kimoun ki te fè yon kòmantè konsènan nivo chalè enkonfòtab la?","The correct answer is **B: Kapitèn ponpye yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kapitèn ponpye yo Scott Kouns te deklare, """"Se te yon jounen cho nan Santa Clara avèk tanperati nan lane 90 yo."""""". This means the fire captain made the comment about the heat.
"
Kikote ki te gen yon pàn kouran akòz aktivite tsunami an?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""kouran an te koupe pandan yon ti tan, sa ki ta pral anpeche otorite tongàn yo resevwa alèt tsunami a..."" which translates to ""...the power was cut for a short time, which would prevent the Tongan authorities from receiving the tsunami alert issued by PTWC.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kijan pàn kouran an te afekte Tonga?","The correct answer is **D: Otorite yo pa te kapab resevwa avètisman enpòtan yo**.

The passage states: ""Kouran an te koupe pandan yon ti tan, sa ki ta pral anpeche otorite tongàn yo resevwa alèt tsunami a ki te difize pa PTWC."" This directly indicates that the power outage prevented the authorities in Tonga from receiving the tsunami warning.
"
Kilè lapolis te kapab sèvi ak zam rada li yo pou kontwole vitès Jonny Reid ap kondi?,"The correct answer is **A: Pandan li t ap kondwi a 160km/h**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sèl fwa kote lapolis te reyisi kwonometre Reid se lè li te ralanti ak 160 km/h."" This means the police were able to use their radar to measure his speed *when he was driving at 160 km/h*.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, poukisa li te difisil pou lapolis Nouvèl Zelann te kontwole vitès Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **B: Machin lan te ba anpil (The car was very slow)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Lapolis newo zelandè a te gen pwoblèm pou itilize rada vitès li yo pou wè nan ki vitès li t ap woule Reid akoz fèb nivo Black Beauty a."" This translates to ""The New Zealand police had trouble using their speed radar to see how fast Reid was driving because of the poor level of the Black Beauty.""  Therefore, the car's poor condition (""fèb nivo"") made it difficult to accurately measure his speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Li te kondi pa ba pase 160km/h (He wasn't driving below 160km/h):** The passage states he *did* exceed 160 km/h.
* **C: Li te kondi sou pon an sèt fwa sèlman (He only drove on the bridge seven times):** The number of times he drove on the bridge is irrelevant to the speed detection problem.
* **D: Auckland Harbour Bridge la trè ansyen (Auckland Harbour Bridge is very old):** The age of the bridge is irrelevant to the speed detection problem.



"
Kikote tranbleman a te santre parapò ak Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 mil nan sid**.

The question states the earthquake was centered approximately 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte.
"
Kisa ki te pase pandan emèt la nan Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Abi sou prizonye (Torture of prisoners)**.

The passage explicitly states that Abu Ghraib prison became famous after the discovery of the abuse of prisoners. Therefore, the most accurate answer to the question ""What happened during the broadcast of Abu Ghraib?"" is the torture of prisoners.
"
Poukisa prizon Irak la te vin genyen notoryete? ,"The correct answer is **D: Dekouvèt abi sou prizonye yo**.

The passage explicitly states that Abu Ghraib prison became infamous *after* the discovery of the abuse of prisoners by American forces.
"
Ki tip evènman ki ta dwe òganize nan War Memorial Stadium Maui an?,"The passage states that a ""gwoup la te anile prestasyon nan estad lagè Memoryal Maui"" (a group's performance was canceled at the War Memorial Stadium Maui) and that 9,000 people were supposed to participate. This suggests a large-scale event.

Of the options, the most likely type of event to draw such a large crowd is a **C: Konsè (Concert)**. 

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Espektak majik (Magic show):** While magic shows can be popular, they typically don't draw 9,000 people.
* **B: Match foutbòl (Football match):** Football matches are held on football fields, not usually in a War Memorial Stadium.
* **D: Aktivite pou ranmase lajan (Fundraiser activity):** Fundraisers can vary greatly in size, but a large-scale one attracting 9,000 people is less common than a concert.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Konsè**.
"
Kiyès finalman ki te bay yon eksplikasyon konsènan anilasyon evènman an?,"The correct answer is **B: Konpayi jesyon an**.

The text states: ""Konpayi jesyon gwoup, HK Management Inc., pa t bay okenn rezon inisyal lè yo te anile 20 septanm, men yo te blame rezon lojistik nan demen."" This directly indicates that HK Management Inc. (the group management company) eventually provided the explanation, even if it was initially vague.
"
Kimoun plizyè nan rezidan Bichkek yo panse ki te responsab piyaj la?,"The correct answer is **C: Manifestan yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Plizyè abitan Bichkèk te akize manifestan ki soti nan sid yo kòm responsab anachi an."" which translates to ""Several residents of Bishkek accused the protesters from the south as responsible for the anarchy.""
"
Kimoun ki te blame manifestan ki soti nan sid yo pou piyaj la?,"The correct answer is **A: Abitan Bichkèk**.

The text explicitly states: ""Plizyè abitan Bichkèk te akize manifestan ki soti nan sid yo kòm responsab anachi an."" (Several residents of Bishkek blamed the protesters from the south as responsible for the anarchy.)
"
Kilè Ring te gen ogmante lavant?,"The correct answer is **A: Apre yon aparisyon nan Shark Tank**.

The text states: ""Siminoff te deklare vant yo te ogmante aprè aparisyon l an 2013 nan yon epizòd Shark Tank kote panèl seri a te refize finanse start up la.""
"
Kilè Jamie Siminoff te deside kòmanse Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Apre li reyalize pwòp sonnèt li pa te kòrèk**.

The text states: ""Oparavan, PDG Ring, Jamie Siminoff, te fè remake antrepriz la te demare lè sonèt pòt li an pat kapab tande depi nan magazen nan garaj li an."" (Oparavan, Ring's CEO, Jamie Siminoff, started the business when his own doorbell wasn't working in his garage.)
"
Pou ki bagay chak epizòd Reading Rainbow te ofri rekòmandasyon pou timoun yo?,"The correct answer is **D: Liv**.

The passage states: ""Chak emisyon ap bay rekòmandasyon tou yo sou liv timoun dwe chèche lè yo pral nan bibliyotèk.""  This directly indicates that the recommendations were for books.
"
Kisa ki te petèt kontribye nan anilasyon seri Reading Rainbow a?,"The correct answer is **A: Finansman ensifizan**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that some people, including John Grant, believe the **financial crisis and changes in the philosophy of educational television programs** contributed to the show's end.  While the passage mentions Emmy Awards and compares the show to Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, it doesn't suggest those were *causes* of cancellation. Grant's opinion is mentioned as a factor, but the financial crisis is a more direct reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mank prim Emmy:** The passage states Reading Rainbow has *won* over a dozen Emmy Awards.
* **C: Opinyon John Grant:** While Grant's opinion is noted, it's not presented as a *cause* of cancellation, but rather a factor in *why* the show ended.
* **D: Siksè Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood:** The passage compares Reading Rainbow to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, but doesn't suggest the success of one contributed to the downfall of the other.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa te yon agiman responsab yo bay pou Amstèdam ak mize a konsènan pyebwa a?,"The correct answer is **B: Yo ta dwe konsève li** (They should conserve it).

Here's why:

* The prompt states Amsterdam and the Anne Frank House declared the tree *infected with a fungus* and a *danger to public health* due to its potential for a rapid fall. 
* They proposed destroying the tree.
* The court intervened and saved the tree.

Therefore, the arguments they *did* make were about its infection, danger, and impending fall.  The option ""Yo ta dwe konsève li"" presents the opposite viewpoint - that they *should have saved* the tree, which wasn't an argument *they* made.  They were arguing *against* conservation.



"
"Dapre yon enspektè anchèf pou RSPCA a, pou kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo enspeksyon yo ta dwe estanda?","The correct answer is **A: Kamera CCTV**.

The passage states: """"CCTV a ta sètènman voye yon siyal fò bay moun sa yo k ap travay ak bèt ke byennèt yo se pi gwo priyorite a."""" This directly refers to the CCTV cameras being the focus of the inspection standard. The inspector emphasizes the importance of CCTV for animal welfare.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki ta ka ede ranfòse enpòtans byennèt bèt yo pou travayè abatwa Ostralyen yo?","The correct answer is **A: Enstalasyon kamera CCTV**.

The passage explicitly states: """"CCTV a ta sètènman voye yon siyal fò bay moun sa yo k ap travay ak bèt ke byennèt yo se pi gwo priyorite a."""" (CCTV will certainly send a strong signal to those working with animals that their welfare is the top priority.)

While the other options might contribute to animal welfare, the passage directly links CCTV to reinforcing the importance of animal welfare for abattoir workers.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki metye moun yo te arete a?","The correct answer is **A: Elèv**.

The passage states: ""yon lòt etidyan te arete an relasyon ak fiziyad 21 mas la nan yon lekòl."" This translates to ""another student was arrested in relation to the March 21 school shooting.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, pandan y ap gaye nouvèl sou yon lòt arestasyon, yo t ap fè antèman pou konbyen viktim?","The correct answer is **D: Kat**.

The passage states: ""Nou la te gaye nouvèl sou yon lòt etidyan te arete an relasyon ak fiziyad 21 mas la nan yon lekòl. Alòske antèman Jeff Weise la ak twa lòt viktim yo te fèt..."" This clearly indicates that the funeral was for four victims (Jeff Weise and three others).
"
"Kòm reyaksyon ak manifestasyon yo, ki peyi ki pa te avanse avèk akò ACTA li te siyen an?","The correct answer is **D: Lityani**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Manifestasyon yo te fèt tou nan Pari, Sofya an Bilgari, Viniyis an Lityani..."" and then later mentions ""Letoi ak Slovaki retade pwosesis adezyon yo nan ACTA."" 
* The question asks which country *didn't advance* with the ACTA agreement as a reaction to the protests.  The text explicitly mentions protests in Viniyis (Turkey) and that Letoi (Slovakia) and Slovaki (Slovakia) were delaying their adoption of ACTA.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **Almay (Germany)** is mentioned as having protests, but not about ACTA specifically.
    * **Polòy (Poland)** had large protests *against* ACTA.
    * **Ekòs (Scotland)** had a small protest, not necessarily related to the delay of adoption of ACTA.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan peyi ki annapre la yo ki te deside ranvwaye pwosesis pou antre nan ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Letoni**.

The passage states: ""Letoi ak Slovaki retade pwosesis adezyon yo nan ACTA."" Letoi is the same as Letoni.
"
Konbyen moun ki te blese akòz ensidan iPod ki chofe twòp yo?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""...kite kat moun ki boule legèman nan men."" which translates to ""...which left four people with minor burns on their hands.""
"
Kimoun ki te di ke ensidan sichofaj yo pa te trè grav?,"The correct answer is **A: METI**.

The text states: ""Ministè a te reponn pandan l kalifye """"vrèman regretab"""" repò rapò Apple lan."" This means the METI (Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) was the one who qualified the incidents as ""really regrettable"" *after* receiving Apple's report, and before that, they had called 34 additional overheating incidents ""non-serious."" Therefore, they were the ones who initially downplayed the severity.
"
"Pandan diskou li a, kisa Steve Jobs te di Apple te pral reyenvante?","The correct answer is **B: Telefòn**.

The text states: """"Jodi a, Apple pral reyenvante telefòn nan..."""" (Today, Apple will reinvent the phone...).
"
Kisa objektif diskou dezèdtan Steve Jobs la te ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Pou lanse yon nouvo telefòn**.

The text explicitly states that Steve Jobs announced, ""Today, Apple is reinventing the phone..."" and then proceeded to pull an iPhone from his pocket. This clearly indicates he was launching a new phone.
"
Kisa Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner te anonse nan Teyat Ajantin lan?,"The correct answer is **A: Kandidati prezidansyèl li**.

The text clearly states: ""Aktyèl senatris epi premyè dam ajantin lan Fernandez de Kirchner te anonse **kandidati l pou prezidan** yèswa nan La Plata..."" (Current senator and First Lady of Argentina Fernandez de Kirchner announced **her candidacy for president** yesterday in La Plata...).
"
Kikote Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner te anonse entansyon l pou l kandida?,"The correct answer is **A: Nan yon teyat distans 31 mil ak La Plata**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Aktyèl senatris epi premyè dam ajantin lan Fernandez de Kirchner te anonse kandidati l pou prezidan yèswa nan La Plata, yon vil ki sitiye ak 50 kilomèt (31 miles) Buenos Aires.""
* This translates to: ""Current senator and First Lady of Argentina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her candidacy for president yesterday evening in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.""

Option A accurately reflects this information. Option B is incorrect because it misstates the location of the theater. Options C and D are also incorrect for similar reasons.
"
Ki rezilta ACMA te genyen anrapò ak Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Lwa sansi yo pa te vyole (Obscenity laws were not violated)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ACMA found Big Brother didn't violate decency laws because the content wasn't stored on their website.  The law requiring content to be physically stored on a server to be considered online content is key. Since it wasn't stored there, the decency laws weren't triggered.



"
Ki paramèt medya yo dwe respekte pou yo konsidere kòm kontni Entènèt?,"The correct answer is **B: Yo dwe rezide fizikman sou yon sèvè** (They must physically reside on a server).

Here's why:

The question states that ACMA didn't take action because the video wasn't stored on the Big Brother website. The text also explains that under the Broadcasting Services Act, for content to be considered ""online content,"" it must physically reside on a server.  Therefore, option B accurately reflects this requirement.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo dwe difize sou Entènèt** (They must be broadcast on the Internet) - While true, this is not the *defining* parameter. Many things are broadcast on the internet that aren't considered online content under this law.
* **C: Yo pa ka estoke sou yon sit Entènèt** (They cannot be stored on a website) - This is incorrect.  The law requires physical storage on a server, not the absence of storage on a website.
* **D: ACMA dwe apwouve yo** (ACMA must approve them) -  This is not a requirement for online content under the law."
Kimoun ki lidè nan Pati Liberal Ostrali a?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text explicitly states that Peter Costello was considered a likely successor to Prime Minister John Howard and supported nuclear energy. Therefore, he was a prominent leader within the Liberal Party of Australia at the time.
"
Poukisa Ostrali pa deja gen yon endistri nikleyè?,"The correct answer is **A: Mank sipò piblik**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that Peter Costello, a potential successor to John Howard, supported a nuclear industry in Australia. He said, ""If it becomes commercial, we have to have it. That means there is no principle objection to nuclear energy."" This implies that a lack of public support is a barrier, as someone in a position to influence policy is advocating for its development.

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   **B: Twò kontwovèsyal:** While nuclear energy *is* controversial, the text focuses on the potential for development rather than the existing controversy.
*   **C: Twò danjere:** The text doesn't mention danger as a reason.
*   **D: Twò chè:** The text doesn't mention cost as a barrier.

Therefore, the most logical inference from the provided text is that a lack of public support is a reason why Australia doesn't already have a nuclear industry."
Ki skiyè ki te fè konpetisyon avèk èd yon gid?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Eskyè polonè ki pa wè a Maciej Krezel ak gid li an Anna Ogarzynska te tèmine nan trèzyèm plas Super-G a."" This directly identifies Maciej Krezel as competing with a guide.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** competed independently.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** competed independently.
*   **D: Anna Ogarzynska** was a guide, not a competitor."
Ki peyi ki te fini dizyèm nan Super-G pou kategori fanm kanpe yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Fenlann**.

The text states: ""Pami yo, Peyi ba avèk Anna Jochemsen ki te tèmine nevyèm nan klas feminen Super-G yè a, **epi Finlann avèk Katja Saarinen ki te tèmine dizyèm nan menm konpetisyon an.**"""
"Dapre pasaj la, ki deklarasyon sou Blake ki pa egzat?","The correct answer is **B: Li te rekonèt atak la**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Prezantatè a, ki te arete sou sèn lan, te **nye atak la**..."" (The presenter, who was arrested at the scene, **denied the attack**...).  This directly contradicts option B, which says he *acknowledged* the attack.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Yo te arete li sou sèn nan** - The passage explicitly states this.
* **C: Li te itilize yon poto pandan atak la** - The passage states: ""...te deklare li te itilize poto a pou pwoteje boutèy li t ap lanse jiska trant moun."" ( ...claimed he used the post to protect himself from bottles he was throwing at up to thirty people).
* **D: Li te deklare yo te voye boutèy sou li** - The passage says he used the post to *protect himself from* bottles he was throwing, not that bottles were being thrown *at* him. Therefore, option D is not exactly what Blake said. 

So, the only incorrect statement is that Blake *acknowledged* the attack."
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa te rive Blake?","The correct answer is **A: Yo te jwenn li koupab pou pèvèsyon lajistis**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Blake te kondane tou paske li t ap eseye kòwonp lakou jistis la.""  This directly means he was found guilty of attempting to corrupt the justice system (perversion of justice).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yo te arete li:** The passage says he was arrested *on the scene*, implying he *was* arrested.
* **C: Yo te atake l ak yon poto:** The passage states *he* used the post to protect himself while throwing bottles.
* **D: Yo te di li gen anpil chans pou yo voye l nan prizon:** The judge said it was ""almost inevitable"" he would be sent to prison. This is not the same as saying he had a *chance*.



"
Pou ki bagay yo p ap sèvi avèk fon ONI an pou rechofman klimatik la?,"The correct answer is **D: Soulaje efè rechofman planèt la**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the funds will be used for:
    * Building flood-resistant houses
    * Better water management
    * Diversifying crops
    * Sharing technology with developing countries.

* While diversifying crops *helps* with climate change adaptation, the overall goal is *adapting* to the effects of climate change, not *relieving* the effects of global warming itself.  Relieving the effects of global warming would involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which isn't mentioned as a specific use of ONI funds in this passage.

Therefore, option D is the one that doesn't align with the stated purpose of the funding.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ONI espere sove?","The correct answer is **C: Forêts tropicales restantes (Forêts tropicales restantes)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Pami lòt sijè ki nan ajenda a nan Bali, gen **pwoteksyon rès forè yo nan mond lan**..."" which translates to ""Among other items on the agenda in Bali, there is **protection of the remaining forests of the world**...""

While the passage also mentions technology sharing and climate finance, the specific thing ONI hopes to save is the remaining forests. Therefore, option C is the most accurate.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo Albert Muchanga pa te site kòm yon bagay yo te bezwen dakò sou li toujou?,"The correct answer is **C: Règ orijin yo**.

The passage states: """"Nou pako mete tèt nou dakò sou règ sou orijin ak tarif pou konsesyon..."""" which translates to ""We haven't agreed on rules on origin and tariffs for concessions..."" This means origin rules were *not* agreed upon. The other options are things that *were* addressed or agreed upon:

*   **A: Si Benen t ap antre nan AfCTA:** The passage explicitly states Benen will join.
*   **B: Dat echanj yo te kapab kòmanse:** The passage mentions a start date of July 1, 2020.
*   **D: Konsesyon tarif yo:** The passage mentions tariffs for concessions, even if there wasn't full agreement.

Therefore, the only thing Albert Muchanga said they *didn't* agree on was the origin rules.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, poukisa echanj yo ka kòmanse an Jiyè?","The correct answer is **B: Genyen yon kad sifizan an plas pou règ ak konsesyon yo.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Nou pako mete tèt nou dakò sou règ sou orijin ak tarif pou konsesyon, men kad ke nou dispoze a sifi pou nou kòmanse echanj 1 jiyè 2020."" (We haven't agreed on rules regarding origin and tariffs for concessions, but the framework we have is sufficient for us to start trade on July 1, 2020.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yon dat kòmansman an Jiyè te fè pati kondisyon Nijerya pou l antre nan AfCFTA la:** While Nigeria's intention is to join, the passage doesn't state that a July start date was a *condition* for their entry.
* **C: Komisyonè komès ak endistri AU an te apwouve li:** The passage doesn't mention the Commissioner's approval being the reason for the July start date.
* **D: To te antann yo sou règ orijin ak konsesyon tarif yo:** The passage clearly states that there was *no agreement* on origin and tariffs.

"
"Dapre pasaj la, de kisa The Atlanta Journal-Constitution te akize responsab edikasyon yo?","The correct answer is **C: Pa aji sou pwoblèm entèn ki detekte yo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a report showing that the test scores were increasing at an ""incredible rate"" and that the school district ""detected the problem but did not take any action with the findings."" This directly indicates the newspaper accused the education officials of failing to address internal problems they themselves identified.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Falsifikasyon rapò Jounal-Konstitisyon an** - The passage doesn't accuse the newspaper of falsifying any reports.
*   **B: Mankman pou inove edikasyon iben an** - The passage highlights innovation, not lack thereof, as part of Hall's initial recognition.
*   **D: Rapòte rezilta tès ki fèb** - The report showed *increasing* test scores, not weak ones.

"
"Dapre enfòmasyon yo bay nan pasaj la, kisa ki pa te mansyone nan rapò Atlanta Journal-Constitution an?","The correct answer is **B: Prèv ke yo te falsifye papye tès yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report *showed* the test results were increasing at an unbelievable rate and *declared* that the school detected a problem but took no action or conclusions.
* The passage then goes on to say that *evidence* showed the exams were being falsified.  Therefore, the report *did not mention* the evidence of falsification.
* Options A, C, and D are all mentioned in the passage."
"Dapre pasaj la, ki enfòmasyon yo konnen apre bonbadman an?","The correct answer is **B: Ki bilding bonm yo te eksploze toupre yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Yon bonm te eksploze devan biwo gouvènèjeneral la. Twa lòt bonm te eksploze bò kote batiman gouvènman yo nan espas dezèdtan."" This directly tells us *where* the bombs exploded (in front of the governor-general's office and near other government buildings).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kontaj final blesi yo:** The passage mentions 30 injuries but says the ""chif definitif yo poko bay"" (final figures are not yet available).
* **C: Si gen bonm siplemantè ki ta dwe eksploze:** The passage doesn't provide any information about potential additional bombs.
* **D: Bilan ofisyèl lanmò yo:** The passage mentions ""rive nan ywit ofisyèl moun ki mouri yo"" (up to eight officials died), but it also states ""chif definitif yo poko bay"" (final figures are not yet available). So the death toll is not confirmed.



"
"Depi li te antre nan Manchester City an 2017, nan konbyen match Jesus te jwe?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text states: ""Depi lè sa a , brezilyen an te jwe 53 match pou klèb la nan tout konpetisyon yo..."" which translates to ""Since then, the Brazilian has played 53 matches for the club in all competitions...""
"
Ki klib Jesus te resevwa yon frè £27 milyon pou li antre ladan?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The text states: ""Jezi ki genyen 21 lane te rejwenn **Mannchestè Siti**..."" which translates to ""Jesus who is 21 years old rejoined **Manchester City**..."".  It also says he came from Palmeiras."
Ki deklarasyon apwopo envite otèl yo ki pa vre?,"The statement that is **not true** is **D: Majorite envite yo te soti nan vil sent lan.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Kliyan pansyon an te majorite sitwayen Emira arab ini."" (The hotel's clients were mostly citizens of the United Arab Emirates.)
* **Options A, B, and C are all supported by the text:**
    * **A:** ""yon kantite pèlren ki te vin vizite vil la apa pou Bondye nan lavèy hajj pelerinaj"" (a number of pilgrims who came to visit the city for God during the Hajj pilgrimage)
    * **B:** While the UAE citizens are the *majority*, it doesn't exclude the possibility of some guests being from other countries.
    * **C:** ""lavèy hajj pelerinaj"" (Hajj pilgrimage)

Therefore, option D is the incorrect statement because the majority of guests were from the UAE, not from the holy city of Mecca itself.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki vre?","The correct answer is **C: Envite yo te la pou lavèy pelerinaj Hajj.**

Here's why:

* **A: Pa te gen okenn lanmò (There were no deaths)** - The passage explicitly states ""Omwen 15 moun ki mouri"" (At least 15 people died). This is false.
* **B: Tout envite yo te soti nan Emira Arab Ini (All guests were from the United Arab Emirates)** - The passage says ""Kliyan pansyon an te majorite sitwayen Emira arab ini"" (The hotel's clients were mostly citizens of the United Arab Emirates), not *all* of them.
* **C: Envite yo te la pou lavèy pelerinaj Hajj (The guests were there for the Hajj pilgrimage)** - The passage states the guests were pilgrims visiting for the Hajj. This is directly supported by the text.
* **D: Majorite envite yo te moun nan lokalite Lamèk (The majority of guests were from the Lamèk locality)** - The passage states the guests were *visiting* Lamèk, not that they were from there.

Therefore, only option C is directly and accurately supported by the information provided in the passage.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki enfòmasyon sou kolizyon an ki pa sèten?","The correct answer is **C: Enpak kolizyon an sou Latè**.

Here's why:

* The passage states scientists are *still trying to determine* how the Earth will be affected. This indicates uncertainty about the impact.
* The passage mentions the collision was ""considerable,"" so the *size* of the collision is stated.
* The passage says the satellite entered the atmosphere at 491 miles, giving the location of the entry, but not necessarily *where the impact was most severe*.
* The passage mentions the US Department of Defense is tracking the debris, indicating the *location of debris* is being monitored, but the exact locations aren't definitively known yet.

Therefore, the impact on Earth is the information that's still uncertain according to the text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki dwe detèmine toujou konsènan kolizyon an?","The correct answer is **D: Echèl egzak la pou aksidan an**.

The passage states: ""Yo toujou ap eseye detèmine nan ki pwen aksidan te grav epi kòman Latè pral afekte."" This translates to ""They are still trying to determine at what point the accident was severe and how the Earth will be affected.""  ""Echèl egzak la pou aksidan an"" (the exact scale of the accident) refers to how severe the impact was.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kimoun ki pral okipe swivi debri yo:** The passage says the US Department of Defense is tracking the debris. It doesn't mention *who* will be responsible for tracking it.
* **B: Nan ki vitès satelit yo t ap deplase nan moman kolizyon an:**  The passage mentions the satellite's speed (17,500 miles per hour), but it's not the key thing they are *still trying to determine*.  They've already stated the speed.
* **C: Kijan yo pral pataje rezilta analiz trasaj yo:** The passage states the results will be published on a public website.  It doesn't focus on *how* they will share them.

"Dapre pasaj la, ki plas Batten te genyen yon fwa sou lis Ameriken ki pi rich yo?","The correct answer is **C: 190yèm**.

The passage states: ""Batten te klase 190yèm sou lis 400 ameriken ki pi rich nan lane 2008..."""
Bay kilès annapre la yo Batten te fè yon don?,"The correct answer is **B: Inivèsite Vijini**.

The text explicitly states: ""Li diplome nan College of Arts & Sciences nan Inivèsite Vijini an 1950 epi li te yon donatè enpòtan nan enstitisyon sa."" This directly links Batten to donating to the University of Virginia.

While he was on the list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, and the College of Arts & Sciences is a part of the University of Virginia, option B is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Kisa ki pa yon pati nan pwojè lwa Gouvènè Arnold Schwarzenegger siyen an?,"The correct answer is **C: Yon entèdiksyon sou lavant oswa lokasyon jwèt videyo vyolan ba minè deyò Kalifòni.**

The text specifically states the law applies *within* the state of California. Options A, B, and D are all mentioned as parts of the law. Therefore, option C is the only one that is *not* part of the law.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kimoun ki te rate bagay yo t ap di yo?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage states: ""Lè nou te mande l kòmante, Miller te deklare, """"Mike pale anpil pandan odisyon an...Mwen t ap prepare m kidonk mwen pat vrèman tande sa li t ap di.""""""  This directly indicates that Miller was the one who didn't really hear what Mike was saying.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki vrè konsènan eksperyans Miller nan odyans lan?","The correct answer is **B: Li pa te fè atansyon pandan li t ap prepare l.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mwen t ap prepare m kidonk mwen pat vrèman tande sa li t ap di."" which translates to ""I was preparing myself so I wasn't really listening to what he was saying."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Duvall te fè yon enpresyon sou Miller pandan odyans lan:** The passage explicitly says Miller *didn't* make a strong impression.
* **C: De timoun Duvall yo te pale anpil pandan odyans lan:** The passage only mentions Duvall having two children. It doesn't say they were talking during the audition.
* **D: Li te pote anpil atansyon sou istwa Duvall la:** Miller says he wasn't listening, implying he didn't pay much attention to Duvall's story.



"
Kimoun ki sijere ke revizyon dwe fèt nan ‘Lwa lè pwòp la’?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The text explicitly states: ""Leyton te mande chanjman nan pwojè lwa sou anviwonman pandan rankont ak premye minis la, li mande yon """"reekriti konplè e apwofondi"""" de pwojè lwa anviwonmanal pati konsevatè an.""  This indicates Jack Layton, the leader of the NDP, suggested revisions.

While the Conservative party (and John Howard) were involved in the law, the question asks *who suggested revisions*.
"
Kimoun ki te demanti ke yo te itilize “Lwa lè pwòp” la kòm stunt avan eleksyon an?,"The correct answer is **B: Yon Premye Minis**.

The text states: ""Premye Minis John Howard te deklare lwa sa te selman le evite enstalasyon lopital yo pa deklase pa gouvènman Tasmani a..."" This indicates that Prime Minister John Howard defended the law and denied it was a stunt.
"
Ki konpoze asid syanirik ak melamin te fòme lè yo reyaji youn ak lòt nan pipi chat?,"The correct answer is **C: Kristal yo** (Crystals).

The passage states that the components (cyanuric acid and melamine) react to form crystals that can block renal function. The research observed these crystals in the urine of affected pets and confirmed their composition using FTIR spectroscopy. Therefore, the reaction forms crystals.
"
Kisa chèchè yo te itilize espektroskopi enfrawouj pou obsève?,"The correct answer is **B: Konpozisyon kristal nan pipi bèt kay**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Konpozisyon kristal sa yo koresponn ak sa yo te jwenn nan pipi bèt domestik ki afekte yo lè yo konpare li pa spektoskopi enfrawouj (FTIR).""  This directly indicates that FTIR was used to analyze the *composition of the crystals* found in the urine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fonksyon ren:** While the crystals *block* kidney function, the FTIR analysis wasn't used to *observe* kidney function directly.
*   **C: Bèt ki afekte yo:** The research focused on the crystals *within* the urine, not on the animals themselves.
*   **D: Manje bèt kay ki kontamine:** The crystals were found *in the urine*, not in the contaminated food.



"
Kimoun ki rele Luna “Rèn Estrèm lan”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**. 

The text states, ""Tommy Dreamer te deklare """"Luna te premye rèn ekstrèm lan."""""". This directly answers the question. While Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels also speaks fondly of Luna, he doesn't state she was the ""Queen of Extreme."""
Kilès ki rele Luna “biza”?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels says ""Ase inik, menm jan avè l."" This means Luna was unique, and he's comparing her to himself, implying he found her ""biza"" or unusual in a good way.
"
Kisa ki pa te rive chofè ki te enplike nan aksidan an?,"The correct answer is **A: Li te blese nan tèt**.

The passage states: ""chofè a te sibi gwo blese nan tèt."" This directly answers the question of what *did* happen to the driver.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Li pa te blese okenn moun anndan kay la:** This is true, but the question asks what happened *to the driver*.
* **C: Li te transfere soti nan yon lopital nan Cambridge ale nan youn nan Great Yarmouth:**  The passage says he was transferred *to* the hospital in Cambridge (Addenbrooke), not from Great Yarmouth.
* **D: Sèvis dijans yo te ede retire l nan machin li:** The passage states that emergency services helped free the driver from the car.  The question asks what *happened* to the driver, not what happened *during* the rescue.



"
Kisa ki pa te yon bagay ki te make gameplay Afrik Sid pandan tounwa rigbi a?,"The correct answer is **C: Yon pèfòmans poli nan kòmansman tounwa a**.

Here's why:

The passage states that South Africa *didn't really show themselves in form* in their match against Zambia. They improved throughout the tournament.  This implies their start wasn't particularly ""polite"" or polished. The passage highlights their disciplined defense, ball control, and teamwork as reasons why they were considered the team to beat. Options A, B, and D are all explicitly mentioned as strengths of the South African team."
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè jwèt Afrik Sid la te kòmanse amelyore?","The correct answer is **B: Apre yo sere defans lan**.

The passage states: ""Defans disipline yo a, metriz balon yo a ak bon travay ekip yo te pèmèt yo demake yo..."" This indicates that their improved performance came *after* they solidified their defense, among other factors. The game started at 10am, but the improvement wasn't at the beginning. Option B is the most accurate based on the provided text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki pa reflete avèk presizyon ekonomi Chin?","The correct answer is **D: Lachin pa te janm ekspòte plis machin pase Almay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""For the first time ever, last year, China exported more automobiles than Germany..."" This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Ekonomi Lachin te grandi yon fason eksponansyèl depi yo fin fè refòm yo:** The passage says the economy has multiplied by 90 since Deng Xiaoping's reforms, indicating exponential growth.
* **B: Lachin gen yon pi gwo mache pou ekspòtasyon machin pase Etazini:** The passage states China exported more automobiles than Germany, and also implies it's becoming the biggest market for the industry, suggesting it's larger than the US market.
* **C: Lachin te kapab finalman gen yon GDP pi gwo pase Etazini:** The passage suggests this is a possibility within the next two decades (""China's GDP could surpass that of the United States in two decades"").



Therefore, only option D is incorrect based on the information provided in the text."
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè GDP Lachin ta ka depase Etazini?","The correct answer is **D: Nan lespas twa deseni (In the next three decades)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""PIB Lachin kapab vin siperyè ak pa Etazini an nan **de deseni**.""  This is stated *in the context of the last two decades*.  While the passage implies the growth is ongoing, the most direct and specific timeframe mentioned for surpassing the US is within the next two decades, which is part of the broader timeframe of *three* decades. 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Apre plis refòm ekonomik (After more economic reforms):** While reforms are important, the passage *already* mentions significant reforms happened under Deng Xiaoping. It's not solely dependent on *more* reforms.
* **B: Nan lespas de deseni (In the next decade):**  The passage specifically says ""nan de deseni"" (in two decades), not one.
* **C: Lè peyi a anba nouvo lidèchip (When the country is under new leadership):** The passage doesn't mention leadership as a direct factor in reaching this economic milestone. The growth is attributed to the economic reforms themselves.



"
Kisa Hu te sijere pou peyi an devlopman yo fè?,"The correct answer is **D: Evite ansyen chemen polisyon yo**.

The text states: ""Hu encouraged developing countries ""to avoid the old path of polluting first and then cleaning up."""" This directly supports option D.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pran responsablite obligasyon ki pouse etap devlopman yo:** Hu said developing countries shouldn't assume obligations that go beyond their development stage.
* **B: Konsantre sou pwodiksyon ekonomik:** While Hu mentioned reducing emissions *per unit of GDP*, the main point of his suggestion was about avoiding pollution.
* **C: Ale pi lwen pase responsablite aktyèl yo:**  Hu explicitly said they shouldn't take on obligations beyond their capabilities and current stage of development.



"
Kisa Hu pa te mansyone?,"The correct answer is **D: Yon chif pou rediksyon emisyon kabòn yo (A number for carbon emission reduction)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Li pat fikse chif pou rediksyon yo..."" which translates to ""He didn't set a number for the reductions...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baz la pou rediksyon yo (The basis for the reductions):** The text mentions reductions will be based on China's economic output (""sou baz pwodiksyon ekonomik Lachin"").
* **B: Konsèy pou peyi an devlopman yo konsènan polisyon (Advice for developing countries regarding pollution):** The text does mention advice for developing countries to avoid following China's path of pollution.
* **C: Yon dat kote, annou espere, emisyon kabòn yo pral redui ak (A date when, hopefully, carbon emissions will be reduced):** The text focuses on the *timeframe* (after 2020) but doesn't specify a target date.

Therefore, the only thing Hu *didn't* mention was a specific numerical target for carbon emission reductions.
"
Pou kilès nan bagay ki annapre la yo Veerman te di sitiyasyon an pa bon?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Richard Veerman, the spokesperson for Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), stated that the situation ""remains very bad for Angola."" 

Therefore, he was referring to the situation *in Angola*.
"
"Akòz akizasyon an, kimoun ki pral okipe pòs kabinè Huhne lan?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Huhne te demisyone epi li pral ranplase nan kabinè a pa depite Ed Davey."" (Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by MP Ed Davey.)
"
Kilès ki pral pran wòl Minis Afè apre akizasyon an?,"The correct answer is **C: Davey**.

The text states: ""Depi Norman Lamb te dwe pran pòs minis zafè a Davey kite a."" This means Ed Davey will be taking over the role of Minister of State.
"
Kisa pèfòmè yo ankouraje odyans lan fè pandan opera Camille Saint-Saens lan?,"The correct answer is **C: Rejwenn yo sou sèn lan pou espektak la**.

The text states that the theater encouraged the public to ""vin jwenn yo"" (come find them), implying joining the performers on stage. While the text mentions drug use and a fascination with Japan, the direct encouragement to the audience is to join the performers.
"
Kimoun ki prensipalman fimen jwen pandan opera a?,"The correct answer is **C: Entèprèt yo**.

The provided text states: ""kote lavi a te dikte pa lanmou pou dwòg ak Japon."" and ""atis yo fimen jwen kanabis sou sèn nan..."" This clearly indicates the *artists* (interpreters/performers) were smoking marijuana on stage.

While the text mentions the theater encouraged the audience to come and see them, the primary action of smoking is attributed to the artists.
"
Ki lòt non pou “mache nan lespas” Leonov te fè a?,"The correct answer is **C: Aktivite ekstraveyikilè**.

The passage states: ""18 mas 1965, li te fè premye aktivite ekstra veyikilè (EVA) abite..."" which translates to ""March 18, 1965, he performed the first inhabited extravehicular activity (EVA)...""  EVA is the technical term for ""mache nan lespas"" or ""walking in space"".

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Misyon Apollo-Soyuz** - This was a later mission, not the name for the EVA itself.
* **B: Kous pou lespas** - This is a general term for spaceflight, not the specific term for exiting a spacecraft.
* **D: Kosmonòt nimewo 11** - This is Leonov's designation, not the name for the EVA.



"
Leonov te dirije pati Sovyetik nan ki misyon?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Apre Dis ane, li te dirije pati Sovyetik nan misyon Apollo-Soyuz ki senbolize ke kous spasyal la te fini."" (After ten years, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission which symbolized the end of the space race.)
"
Kimoun ki te blese nan aksidan an?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""Apre aksidan an, yo te mennen Gibson lopital men li te mouri apre."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital but died afterward.)

While the other options mention people involved, only Gibson is explicitly stated to have been injured and died. The garage worker and children witnessed the accident, and the truck driver was unharmed.
"
Kisa ki te rive moun ki te enplike nan aksidan an?,"The correct answer is **B: Youn pa te blese, youn te mouri**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Gibson died after the accident (""yo te mennen Gibson lopital men li te mouri apre"").
* The truck driver was not injured (""Chofè kamyon an, ki gen 64 lane pat blese nan aksidan an"").
* The other details in the passage describe the scene of the accident and the reactions of witnesses, not the ultimate fate of the people involved.

Therefore, only option B accurately reflects the information provided.
"
Syantis k ap travay sou pwogram nan te espere obsève efè kilès nan bagay ki annapre la yo te lakòz?,"The correct answer is **B: Fòs lamare yo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Efè ekip la rechèche a ta koze pa fòs mare yo ant matyè nwa galaksi an ak matyè nwa Vwa lakte a."" (The effect the team was researching would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.)

While the passage mentions dark matter and its distribution, the *specific effect* the scientists were expecting to observe was due to tidal forces.
"
Matyè kilès nan bagay ki annapre la yo syantis yo te ap obsève?,"The correct answer is **D: Galaksi Sajitè a ak Lavwa Lakte**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the program was written to test observations of **Sagittarius galaxy** and the effects of tidal forces between the **black matter of Sagittarius** and the **black matter of the Milky Way**.  While the Earth and Moon are mentioned as an analogy for tidal forces, the *actual* objects being studied are the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa konsèvatè pa kritike?","The correct answer is **D: Depans rekonstriksyon yo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that conservatives mocked the spending on aid and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina, giving it the sarcastic label ""Bush's New Orleans Plan."" This directly indicates their criticism was focused on the *amount of money being spent* on reconstruction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Depans sekou yo:** While aid was part of the overall spending, the passage specifically mentions the criticism was related to the *reconstruction* spending, not just aid.
*   **B: Mank efò pou rekonstriksyon:** The passage doesn't claim conservatives criticized a lack of effort, but rather the *way* the effort was being funded or perceived.
*   **C: Kimoun yo akòde kontra rekonstriksyon yo:** The passage focuses on the *spending* itself, not on who agreed or disagreed with reconstruction.



"
Kimoun ki kritike kontra rekonstriksyon yo pou efò sekou Siklòn Katrina yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Liberal yo**.

The text states: ""kritik liberal efò rekonstriksyon an te baze sou atribisyon kontra rekonstriksyon pou yon gwoup inisye washinntonn."" This translates to: ""Liberal critics based their criticism of the reconstruction efforts on attributing counter-reconstruction to a Washington-based initiative.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kikote limyè ki soti nan veso espasyal Stardust la pral vizib anpremye?","The correct answer is **B: Northern California**.

The passage states: ""It will travel across all of northwestern California and light up the skies of California and all of central Oregon, into Nevada, Idaho and Utah."" Since Northern California is mentioned first in the list of areas the light will be visible, and the passage says it will be visible as the capsule enters the atmosphere, it's the most likely place the light will be seen first.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, veso espasyal la pral etabli yon rekò pou kilès nan bagay ki annapre la yo?","The correct answer is **C: Retounen sou Latè pi rapid**.

The passage states: ""Stardust gen pou li etabli yon nouvo rekò toutan an paske li se veso spasyal ki pi rapid ki retounen sou latè..."" This directly indicates that the spacecraft will set a record for the fastest return to Earth.

The other options are mentioned as consequences of the return, but not the record itself.
"
Kijan Doktè Malar Balasubramanian te fanmi ak Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Manman**.

The text states that the deceased was Saroja Balasubramanian, 53 years old. The doctor accused of her death is Malar Balasubramanian, 29 years old.  The most logical familial relationship between a 53-year-old woman and a 29-year-old woman would be mother and daughter."
Kikote yo te jwenn kò Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: Arebò wout la**

The text states: ""...dokte Malar Balasubramanian, 29 lane te jwenn nan Blue Ash, nan Ohio, yon lokalite sitiye ak anviwon 15 miles nan nò Cincinnati, **alonje atè a bò wout lan**..."" 

While the body was in the trunk, it was *found* at the side of the road.
"
Kisa akizisyon eBay te fè ?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The question states that eBay's large acquisition was of Skype, and the goal was to diversify profit sources and gain popularity in regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.
"
Kisa eBay ap chèche reyalize ak akizisyon an?,"The correct answer is **B: Elaji nan nouvo teritwa**.

The provided text explicitly states that eBay hoped to diversify its profit sources and gain *more popularity in regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil*. This directly relates to expanding into new territories.  While consolidating revenue, increasing profile, and satisfying shareholders might be *results* of expanding, the primary goal mentioned is geographical expansion.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kimoun ki pa te kominike avèk prizonye yo ki te rete nan lakou a apre batay la?","The correct answer is **A: Negosyatè yo**.

The passage states: ""Negosyatè yo te eseye rektifye sitiyasyon an, men demann prizonye yo pa klè."" This directly indicates that the negotiators were the ones trying to communicate with the prisoners, but were unsuccessful. The other options are not mentioned as being involved in attempting to communicate with the prisoners.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki te lakòz prizonye yo renonse finalman ak emèt la?,"The correct answer is **D: Yon dife (A fire)**.

The passage states that the prisoners *declanched* (started) a fire in the courtyard. This action, and the subsequent use of tear gas to extinguish it, is what ultimately led to the situation escalating and the prisoners being contained.  It wasn't a successful negotiation, the prisoners weren't motivated by their injured comrades, and tear gas was a response to the fire, not the cause of the prisoners' initial refusal.
"
"Dapre Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, de kisa peyi Iran ta dwe libere tèt li?","The correct answer is **D: Yon depandans sou petwòl (A dependence on oil)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, te dekri depandans de petwòl la kòm yon """"pyèj"""" ki la depi anvan revolisyon Islamik Iran an nan ane 1979  epi peyi a ta dwe soti tèt li ladan."" This clearly indicates that he believes Iran needs to break free from its dependence on oil.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kimoun ki te admèt efè sanksyon an sou ekonomi Iranyen an?","The correct answer is **A: Sous senyò yo**.

The passage states: ""Kòmantè sa yo, an dirèk nan televizyon a, se te premye fwa ke pi wo nivo sous irànyen yo te admèt ke sanksyon yo te gen yo efè kèlkonk."" This directly translates to ""These comments, on direct TV, were the first time that the highest levels of Iranian sources admitted that the sanctions had any effect."" ""Sous senyò yo"" translates to ""highest levels of Iranian sources"".
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa fè pati pwosesis vòt Lafrans?,"The correct answer is **D: Reprezantan kandida yo konte vòt yo** (Candidate representatives count the votes).

Here's why:

* The text clearly states that votes are counted by **volunteers on a large monitoring team**, following specific procedures. It *doesn't* mention candidate representatives counting the votes.
* The text *does* mention that candidate representatives can be present at all stages of the process.
* The text mentions that voters sign the ballot.
* The text mentions transparent ballot boxes.



Therefore, option D is not a part of the described voting process in France."
Kikote votè yo endike kandida yo chwazi a?,"The correct answer is **B: Sou yon fèy papye enprime davans**.

The text states: ""moun yo fèmen kò yo nan yon pyès, mete nan yon anvlòp yon papye ki deja enprime ki ba yo mwayen chwazi kandida yo."" This translates to: ""people close themselves in a room, put in an envelope a pre-printed paper with the name of the candidate they have chosen.""
"
Kisa ki te mennen Allen kòmanse yon rechèch uit ane pou Musashi a?,"The correct answer is **D: Enterè li nan lagè a**.

The text states: ""Allen ta envesti yon pati nan richès li nan eksplorasyon marin epi te kòmanse rechèch li an pou jwenn Musashi an akoz enterè l toujou genyen pou lagè."" This directly links his interest in war to his motivation for the search. While the other options are related, they aren't the *primary* reason mentioned in the text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, sou kisa Allen te depanse yon montan enpòtan nan lajan li?","The correct answer is **B: Eksplorasyon maren (Marine exploration)**.

The passage states: ""Youn nan moun ki pi rich nan mond lan, Allen ta envesti yon pati nan richès li **nan eksplorasyon marin**..."" (One of the world's richest men, Allen would invest a portion of his wealth **in marine exploration**...). This directly indicates he spent a significant amount of money on marine exploration. While he used a ROV and did underwater mapping, these were *part* of the marine exploration effort."
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki gen anpil chans mennen nan kondisyon danjere andedan izin lan ak toutotou li?","The correct answer is **A: Kabiran iranyòm**. Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Selon ajans nikleyè Japon an, yo te idantifye sezyòm ak yòd radyoaktif nan izin lan. Otorite yo sipoze ke sa demontre ke kontenè yo ki genyen **gaz iranyòm** sou sit la ta sanble andomage epi ta gen fwit ladan.""

This sentence directly links the potential leakage from uranium gas containers to the dangerous conditions inside the plant. The other options are present, but the passage specifically points to the uranium gas containers as the source of the most likely dangerous situation.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa youn nan konsèy sekirite yo sijere rezidan lokal yo apre ensidan an nan izin lan?,"The correct answer is **C: Evite inalasyon lafimen blan**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states residents should avoid breathing in the white smoke.** This is a direct instruction from authorities.
* The text also mentions staying indoors and not drinking tap water as safety measures.
* While avoiding air conditioners is mentioned as a precaution due to potential contamination, and avoiding tap water is a precaution, the text doesn't specifically mention avoiding inhaling the white smoke as a separate instruction – it's implied by the warning about the smoke itself.

Therefore, option C is the least directly supported by the provided text as a specific safety recommendation.
"
"Dapre Doktè Moll, kisa ki pi enkyetan konsènan XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: To mòtalite elve li**.

Dr. Moll explicitly states the new variant is ""very worrying for the reason the mortality rate is very high."" While the other options are factors related to XDR-TB, the immediate and most concerning aspect according to Dr. Moll is the increased mortality.
"
Konbyen pasyan ki te trape nouvo varyant lan te ki konfime kòm travayè swen sante?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""Nan lespas yon lane, yon moun enfekte ka kontamine 10 a 15 moun pwòch. Sepandan, pou pi piti de nan yo te travayè sanitè lopital la.""  This directly indicates that **two** healthcare workers were among those potentially infected.
"
Ki kalite teknoloji sistèm NextGen lan itilize?,"The correct answer is **A: Teknoloji ki baze sou satelit**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yo itilize teknoloji satelit yo pa rapò a ansyen teknoloji rada yo..."" which translates to ""They use satellite technology instead of older radar technology...""
"
Kijan NextGen benefisye dirèkteman kontwolè trafik ayeryen yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Anplasman avyon pi presi**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states that NextGen uses satellite technology to allow air traffic controllers to **localize aircraft with better positioning and provide pilots with precise information.** 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wout vòl ki pi kout:** While NextGen *enables* shorter routes, this isn't a direct benefit *to* air traffic controllers. It's a consequence of the system.
* **C: Rediksyon emisyon kabòn:**  This is a benefit *of* NextGen, but not a direct benefit to the controllers.
* **D: Mwens kabiran:** This is a general consequence of fuel savings and reduced emissions, but not a direct benefit to the controllers.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, sou kisa istoryen yo pa kritike FBI paske li te konsantre l sou li?","The correct answer is **B: Bay resous pou krim ki ka rezoud fasilman**.

Here's why:

The passage states historians criticized the FBI for using resources on ""things that were easy to solve,"" specifically mentioning car theft. This implies they were criticized for *allocating resources to easy cases*. The passage also mentions the FBI focusing on adult pornography, which was a direct result of congressional funding and a shift in priority.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ranfòse pousantaj siksè yo a:** The passage implies the criticism *stemmed from* focusing on easy cases, not necessarily *to* boost success rates.
*   **C: Gwo konsantrasyon sou ka pònografik yo:** The passage states the FBI *did* focus on adult pornography, and Congress even mandated it. This wasn't a point of criticism, but rather a change in direction.
*   **D: Ka machin yo vòlè:** The passage uses car theft as an *example* of the types of easy cases historians criticized the FBI for focusing on. It wasn't a thing the historians were criticizing *about* car theft itself.



"
Kisa inisyativ obsenite a fòse FBI fè?,"The correct answer is **D: Konsakre ajan yo sou ka pònografi yo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kongrè a te kòmanse finanse inisyativ sou salte pandan egzèsis 2005 lan epi presize FBI dwe konsakre 10 ajan nan pònografi pou granmoun."" This directly translates to the initiative forcing the FBI to concentrate agents on adult pornography cases.
"
Kisa ki te pase machin ponpye ki te reponn pou aksidan JAS 39C Gripen lan? ,"The correct answer is **C: Li te eksploze (It exploded)**.

The question states: ""Medya lokal yo rapote yon machin dife ayewopò woule pandan y ap reponn."" (Local media reported an airport fire truck rolling while responding.)  The previous sentence says the JAS 39C Gripen plane exploded. While the fire truck rolling is a separate event, the question asks what happened to the fire truck *while responding*. The context implies the fire truck was involved in the explosion or had an incident related to the plane's explosion.  Since ""eksploze"" (exploded) is the event that caused the airport closure and is directly linked to the incident, it's the most logical choice, even if the fire truck's exact fate is only implied.
"
"Apre aksidan JAS 39C Gripen lan, pou kisa ayewopò a te fèmen?","The correct answer is **A: Vòl komèsyal yo**.

The text states: ""... fèmen ayewopò a pou vòl komèsyal yo."" which translates to ""...closed the airport for commercial flights.""
"
Kilès Brzezinski te ofri konsèy pandan Revolisyon Iranyen an?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states that Brzezinski advised Carter on foreign policy during the 1976 election and served as NSA under Carter from 1977 to 1981, during which time he helped manage the Iranian hostage crisis.
"
Kilès ki te okipe pòs Konseye Sekirite Nasyonal la jiska 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The text states that Brzezinski replaced Henry Kissinger as NSA in 1977. Therefore, Kissinger held the position until 1977.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa reflete avèk presizyon karyè Bobek nan Partizan Bèlgrad?,"The correct answer is **A: Li te make plis pase 468 gòl pandan li t ap jwe pou ekip la**

Here's why:

The provided text clearly states Bobek scored **403** goals in 468 appearances. Option A claims he scored *more* than 468 goals, which is factually incorrect.

The other options are accurate according to the text:

*   **B: Li te make plis gòl pase nenpòt lòt jwè:** The text says he holds the record for most goals.
*   **C: Yon fwa yo te vote li meyè jwè nan istwa ekip la:** The text mentions he was elected best player in the club's history in 1995.
*   **D: Li te parèt nan plis match pase nenpòt lòt jwè:** The text states he holds the record for most appearances.



"
Ki deklarasyon sou istwa Bobek ak Partizan Bèlgrad ki vre?,"The correct answer is **A: Li te kòmanse jwe pou Partizan an 1945**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Li te rejwenn yo an 1945 epi li te rete jous an 1958."" (He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.)
* **B is incorrect:** The text says he was from Zagreb, but doesn't state he played for Zagreb *before* Partizan.
* **C is incorrect:** The text says he played until 1958, not 1995.
* **D is incorrect:**  He was already popular *during* his time at Partizan before being voted best player in 1995. The vote solidified his legendary status, it didn't *cause* his fame.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki karakteristik ki diferansye Hesperonychus ak Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Li gen yon dezyèm grif ki pi gwo.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Dezyèm grif yo te pigwo, se sak fè yo relel Hesperonychus ki vle di """"grif oksidantal."""" "" (The second claws were large, which is why they were called Hesperonychus, meaning ""western claw."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Li gen de janm:** Both Hesperonychus and Velociraptor are bipedal (walk on two legs), so this isn't a differentiating factor.
* **C: Li gen yon kò ki kouvri ak plim konplètman:**  The passage says they *think* Hesperonychus had feathers, but it doesn't say they were completely covered in them.  It doesn't mention Velociraptor's feather coverage either.
* **D: Li gen san cho:** The passage states that Hesperonychus was thought to be warm-blooded, but doesn't say Velociraptor was. However, the distinctive feature mentioned is the claws.



"
Nan ki karakteristik fizik espès la siyifikasyon “Hesperonychus” soti?,"The correct answer is **A: Grif (yo)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dezyèm grif yo te pigwo, se sak fè yo relel Hesperonychus ki vle di """"grif oksidantal."""" (Their second claws were large, which is why they were called Hesperonychus, meaning ""western claw."")
"
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo konsènan tir la ki vre?,"The correct answer is **C: Koup la te marye yon ane anvan sa nan Buffalo.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Koup la te marye nan Texas yon ane avan sa e yo te vini nan Buffalo pou selebre ak zanmi ak fanmi."" This directly confirms option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mari ak madanm lan, yo toude te soti Texas:** The text says they were *married* in Texas, but it doesn't state that they *were* from Texas.
* **B: Te gen senk viktim:** The text says ""yon nan kat moun ki te mouri,"" meaning there were *four* victims, not five.
* **D: Fiziyad la te fèt nan Buffalo:** The text says they *came* to Buffalo to celebrate, but it doesn't say the shooting happened there.

"
Ki deklarasyon konsènan evènman kote tir la te fèt la ki egzat?,"The correct answer is **A: Li te fèt nan yon fèt anivèsè nan Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states, ""O mwen te gen 100 moun nan fèt la, pou yo te ka selebre premye anivèsè koup ki te marye ane pase a."" This clearly indicates a birthday party.
* It also says the party was in Buffalo.
* While it was a celebration of a wedding anniversary, it was a *birthday party* celebrating that anniversary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Li te fèt nan yon evènman anivèsè ofisyèl:**  The passage mentions a ""mari ki gen 30 an, ki te fèt Buffalo, se te youn nan kat moun ki te mouri nan fiziyad la,"" and the context is a birthday party of the couple. The passage doesn't specify that the event was an ""official anniversary event.""
* **C: Li te fèt nan yon fèt nan Texas:** The couple got married in Texas, but the party was in Buffalo.
* **D: Li te fèt nan maryaj koup la:** The passage describes a celebration of their *first* wedding anniversary, not the wedding itself.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki te premye enkyetid pami responsab yo konsènan Luno a?","The correct answer is **D: Posiblite blesi pou manm ekipaj yo** (Possibility of injury to the crew members).

The passage states: ""Elikoptè yo te pote sekou douz manm ekipaj la ak sèl blese se te yon nen kase."" (Helicopters rescued the twelve crew members and the only injury was a broken nose.) This indicates that the safety of the crew was a primary concern. While other factors like the cargo and the storm were present, the immediate action and the stated injury highlight the concern for the crew's well-being.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo sou pàn Luno a ki pa vre?","The incorrect statement is **B: Bato a te gen 100 mèt kabiran abò nan moman pàn lan**.

The text states the boat was on its way to collect *fertilizer* cargo, not *kabiran* (which is a type of fuel).  The boat's size is mentioned (100-meter boat), but the cargo it was carrying is specified as fertilizer.

Here's why the other options are correct:

* **A: Pàn nan te rive anvan yo te pran kago a:** The text says the boat was on its way to collect fertilizer, implying the incident happened *before* it reached its destination.
* **C: Pami douz manm ekipaj yo, youn te blese:**  The text explicitly states ""sèl blese se te yon nen kase"" (the only injury was a broken nose).
* **D: Yo te pouse bato a nan briz lam:** The text says ""van fò yo ak vag yo te pouse l nan breakwater a"" (strong winds and waves pushed it into the breakwater).



"
Nan ki deseni Aljeri te pran endepandans li?,"The correct answer is **C: Ane 1960 yo**.

The text states: ""Nan lane1960 li retounen Aljeri yon peyi ki fèk pran endepandans li pou li anseye sinematografi."" (In the 1960s he returned to Algeria a country that had just gained independence to teach cinematography.)
"
Kikote yo pa te enstale ekran televizyon pou seremoni antèman an?,"The correct answer is **D: Sou plas Sen Pyè (On St. Peter's Square)**.

The text explicitly states: ""it was not possible for everyone to have access to the funeral on St. Peter's Square."" This means screens weren't installed *on* the square itself.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nan tout vil Wòm lan (In all of Rome)** - The text says screens were installed in *different* locations throughout Rome, not *all* of them.
*   **B: Nan divès vil Italyen (In various Italian cities)** - The text mentions screens were installed in various cities in Italy.
*   **C: Nan sèten kote nan Polòy (In certain places in Poland)** - The text explicitly states that Poland had installations.



"
Kikote seremoni antèman an te òganize?,"The correct answer is **C: Sou plas Sen Pyè**.

The text explicitly states: ""...it was not possible for everyone to have access to the funeral at St. Peter's Square.""  While screens were set up *in various locations* in Rome and elsewhere, the *location of the actual ceremony* was St. Peter's Square.
"
"Apre eksplozyon an, kimoun yo te trete pou blesi grav?","The correct answer is **A: Omwen senk moun**.

The passage states: ""Yo pa t siyale okenn blese grav, men pou pi piti senk moun ki prezan kote eksplozyon an te fèt la te trete pou sentom chòk."" This translates to ""No serious injuries were reported, but at least five people present at the scene were treated for symptoms of shock.""
"
Kimoun ki te rapòte flit gaz la?,"The correct answer is **A: Yon vwazen nan bilding lan (A neighbor of the building)**.

The text states: ""Yon ajan konpayi gaz la te ale sou plas aprè yon vwazen te rele pou yon fwit gaz."" (A gas company agent went to the scene after a neighbor called about a gas leak.)
"
"Dapre pasaj la, konbyen moun ki te mouri nan atak la?","The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states that Edgar Veguilla was injured, Kristoffer Schneider required surgery, and that someone was shot (implied to be killed). The question asks how many *died*. While the passage doesn't explicitly state who died, the fact that Schneider required extensive reconstructive surgery and is suffering permanent pain, along with Veguilla's injuries, points to fatalities. The text also mentions ""a fifth black man"" was pointed at, implying he was also shot. Therefore, there were **four** fatalities.
"
Kimoun zam pa te rive tire nan yon sèten moman pandan atak la?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The text states: ""am Uka a **echwe alò li te pwente sou tèt yon senkyèm nèg**."" This implies Uka's weapon malfunctioned, and he then pointed it at someone. This indicates his weapon did not fire at that moment.
"
Kilès nan espò annapre la yo ke yo te retire nan pwogram olenpik la?,"The correct answer is **C: Bezbòl**.

The text states: ""Skach, karate ak espò a woulèt te tante rantre nan pwogram olenpik la menm jan ak bezbòl ki te elimine nan jwèt olenpik yo an 2005."" (Squash, karate and roller sports tried to re-enter the Olympic program just like baseball which was eliminated from the Olympic Games in 2005.)
"
Kilès nan espò annapre la yo Komite Olenpik Entènasyonal la te vote pou mete nan jwèt yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby**.

The text states: ""Rugby, pi klè rugby kolektif la ak gòlf te chwazi pami senk lòt espò pou yo konsidere yo tankou patisipan nan Jwèt olenmpik yo."" (Rugby, specifically the team sport rugby, and golf were chosen among five other sports to be considered as participants in the Olympic Games.)
"
"Odepa, Arthur Guinness te lwe Brasri St James’ Gate pou konbyen ane?","The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The question asks how many years Arthur Guinness leased the brewery. The text states he signed a 9,000-year lease. The other options are incorrect:

*   A: 250 refers to the number of years *after* the lease was signed before Guinness became an international business.
*   B: 10 is not mentioned in the text.
*   C: 1759 is the year the lease was signed, not the duration of the lease.



"
Apeprè konbyen milya dola Guinness rapòte chak ane?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states that 250 years after the lease, Guinness became an international business brewing 10 billion euros (14.7 billion US dollars) *each year*.  14.7 billion is approximately 14 billion.
"
Nan konbyen peyi nan Inyon Ewopeyèn an yo te idantifye viris H5N1 an?,"The correct answer is **C: Sèt**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lafrans se setyèm peyi nan Inyon ewopeyèn k ap soufri ak viris sa..."" which translates to ""France is the seventh country in the European Union suffering from this virus...""
"
Kikote yo te idantifye ka viris H5N1 pi resan an?,"The correct answer is **A: Lafrans**.

The text states: ""Souch grip avyè a mòtèl pou lòm, H5N1, te konfime tankou sa ki te enfekte yon kana sovaj ki mouri, twouve lendi, nan yon marè tou prè Lyon, nan lès Lafrans."" (The deadly avian flu strain, H5N1, has been confirmed as the one that infected a dead wild bird, found Monday, near Lyon, in eastern France.)
"
Kilè Ayiti te fè dènye rankont ak maladi a anvan pwopagasyon sòlda mentyen lapè yo te lakòz?,"The correct answer is **A: Ane 1800 yo**.

The text states: ""Avan twoup yo te rive, Ayiti pa t rankontre pwoblèm ki lye avèk maladi depi lane 1800 yo."" (Before the troops arrived, Haiti had not encountered problems with disease since the 1800s.)
"
Apati ki kote fatra te kontribye nan pwopagasyon maladi a?,"The correct answer is **A: Rivyè Latibonit**.

The text states: ""Daprè pwosè a, fatra latrin nan kan Nasyonzini an pa te byen elimine, sa ki lakòz bakteri antre nan larivyè Latibonit...""  This directly links the improper disposal of latrine waste in the UN camp to the contamination of the Latibonit River.
"
Kisa gouvènman Ilandè a planifye pou fè?,"The correct answer is **B: Entwodui lwa ki pi sevè sou admisibilite dwòg.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the government is insisting on **legislative reform** to rectify the situation.
* It emphasizes the need for legislation to be applied quickly, either through public health or criminal justice channels.
* The Minister of Health mentions the **condemnation of drug offenders** who are currently benefiting from provisional legality. This implies a desire for stricter penalties and enforcement.
* The text refers to ""anti-constitutional changes"" related to drug laws, further indicating a push for stricter regulations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Remèt kondanasyon bay delenkan dwòg yo** (Re-imposing convictions on drug offenders) While related, the text focuses on *legislation* to address the issue, not simply re-imposing existing convictions.
* **C: Rilaks lwa sou akseptabilite dwòg** (Relax drug acceptance laws) This is the opposite of what the government is aiming for.
* **D: Dekriminalize dwòg** (Decriminalize drugs) This is also contrary to the government's stated intention of rectifying the situation and enforcing existing laws.



"
Kisa ki te legal tanporèman nan Iland?,"The correct answer is **D: Dwòg (Drugs)**.

The text states: ""...pou byennèt moun yo k ap pwofite legalite **prouvizwa sibtans konsène yo pou kondanasyon ki lye ak dwòg**..."" This translates to ""...for the well-being of people who are benefiting from the **temporary legality of substances related to drugs** for convictions made with drugs...""

Therefore, the temporary legality referred to in the text is related to drugs.
"
Pou kisa y ap envestige delenkan yo sispèk la?,"The correct answer is **C: Vandalis**.

The text states the investigation is for ""infraction"" but *not* theft. The modification to the sign (changing ""O"" to ""e"") indicates deliberate damage or defacement, which is vandalism.
"
"Lè w modifye siy lan, kisa sispèk la pa te fè?","The correct answer is **C: Andomaje li fizikman**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the sign *was not* broken physically. It was modified.
* The passage explicitly mentions using decorative black tape, a peace sign, and a heart to modify the letter ""O"".
* Therefore, the suspect did not physically damage the sign.

The other options are partially true but not the *best* answer based on the information provided:

* **A: Chanje youn nan lèt li yo** - This is true, but the question asks what the suspect *didn't* do.
* **B: Dekore li ak yon siy lapè** - This is true, but it's an action *taken* during the modification, not what wasn't done.
* **D: Sèvi ak prela pou modifye li** - This is essentially saying the same as B, and again, it's an action, not something the suspect *didn't* do.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, pou kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ke yo pa te akize titè anglè Karno a?","The correct answer is **A: Vyolasyon dwadotè (Copyright violation)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Li te akize tou avan pou vyolasyon dwa otè, men li pat enkilpe."" (He was also accused of copyright violation, but he was not convicted.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sòti avèk yon etidyan (Having a relationship with a student):** The passage *implies* potential issues with this due to the claims of seduction and being like a friend, but it doesn't state he was accused of it.
* **C: Enprime piblisite san otorizasyon (Printing publicity without authorization):** The passage says this caused controversy but doesn't state he was accused of it.
* **D: Sèvi ak langaj derespektan nan klas la (Using disrespectful language in class):** The passage says parents found words in his notes offensive and that he sometimes used vulgar language *in class*, implying accusations, but it doesn't explicitly state he was accused of it.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kimoun Rolando Mendoza pa te pran an otaj?","The correct answer is **C: Timoun**.

The passage states: ""Sis otaj, ladan yo timoun yo ak granmoun yo te libere..."" This means children were among the hostages.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki otaj yo pa te konfime ke yo te libere bonè?","The correct answer is **A: Touris yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Plizyè otaj te sove epi sis dènye yo te konfime yo mouri jiska prezan."" (Several hostages were rescued and six remaining ones were confirmed dead to date.)
* This means the six remaining hostages were confirmed dead, and therefore not rescued/liberated.
* While the passage mentions specific groups of hostages (elderly, photographers, children), it doesn't specify whether *any* of those groups were confirmed dead. Only the ""sis dènye yo"" (six remaining ones) are definitively stated to have died. 

Therefore, tourists are the group that the passage explicitly states were among the dead, indicating they were not rescued/liberated.
"
"Daprè pasaj la, kilès k ap rasanble siyati pou soutni legalizasyon maryaj moun menm sèks nan peyi Brezil?","The correct answer is **A: Manifestan (Protesters)**.

The passage states: ""Manifestan yo espere rekòlte yon petisyon 1.2 milyon siyati..."" which translates to ""Protesters hope to collect a petition of 1.2 million signatures...""
"
Bay kimoun manifestan yo pral remèt petisyon yo a?,"The correct answer is **C: Kongrè Nasyonal Brezil la**.

The text states: ""Manifestan yo espere rekòlte yon petisyon 1.2 milyon siyati pou prezante nan Kongrè nasyonal la an novanm."" (Demonstrators hope to collect a petition of 1.2 million signatures to present to the National Congress in November.)
"
"Dapre istwa Armand Versace a, kisa ki te rive dirèkteman anvan foul moun yo te kòmanse reyaji ak tan an?","The correct answer is **A: Lagrèl te kòmanse tonbe.**

The passage states: ""...epi lapli kòmanse, men fò ak gwo anpil lè l tonbe sou po w tankou yon zegwi..."". This directly precedes the description of people panicking and rolling over each other. The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Ekspozisyon an te anreta senk minit:** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Te gen gwo van:** While there was a strong wind, the passage says the rain *started* falling *after* the wind increased, and the falling rain was the immediate trigger for the panic.
* **D: Li te pèdi tras yon manm fanmi:**  Losing his sister and friend is mentioned, but it happened *before* the immediate panic and chaos caused by the rain and wind.
"
"Dapre Versace, kilè van ki pi fò yo te kòmanse?","The correct answer is **A: Kèk minit apre ekspozisyon an te kòmanse**.

The text states: ""Senk minit aprè kòmansman ekspozisyon an, yon van kòmanse soufle..."" (Five minutes after the start of the exhibition, a wind started blowing...). This means the wind started *after* the exhibition began. The question asks *when* the strongest winds began, and the text specifies the wind reached 70km/h *about a minute* after it started. Therefore, it was a few minutes after the exhibition began.
"
"Anvan Fred, konbyen gwo tanpèt yo te anrejistre nan lès 35°W?","The correct answer is **B: Twa**.

The passage states: ""Frèd se pi fò siklòn twopikal yo pa janm anrejistre lwen konsa nan sid epi ak lès Atlantik lan depi kòmansman imajri satelit, epi sèlman twazyèm ouragan enpòtan ki anrejistre nan lès 35°W."" This directly indicates that there have been three significant hurricanes recorded in that area.
"
"Lè Fred te sitiye toupre zile Kap Vè, nan ki direksyon li t ap deplase?","The correct answer is **D: Northwest**.

The text states: ""Frèd pou kounya gen van 165 km/è (105 mile pa lè) epi ap dirije yo nan **nòdwès**."" which translates to ""Fred now has winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) and is heading **northwest**.""
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki gen vitès pi rapid pase sa anvan li yo?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The text explicitly states: ""Vitès yo se 802.11n yo siperyè anpil ak pa predesesè yo a, avèk yon randman teyorik maksimal 600Mbit/s.""  This means 802.11n is significantly faster than its predecessors.
"
Kisa ki nesesè pou 802.11n konpatib annaryè avèk 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Doub radyo**.

Here's why:

* **802.11n's backward compatibility with 802.11b relies on having both 2.4GHz and 5GHz radios.**  802.11b only operates on the 2.4GHz band. To be compatible, the 802.11n device needs to support 2.4GHz (for 802.11b) *and* 5GHz.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vitès vrèman pi rapid (Really faster speed):** While 802.11n is faster, simply being faster doesn't guarantee backward compatibility. The key is supporting the older standards' frequencies.
* **B: Kapasite pou 802.11b opere sou 5.0Ghz (Ability for 802.11b to operate on 5.0GHz):** 802.11b doesn't operate on 5GHz.  This is fundamentally incorrect.
* **C: Yon debi 600Mbit/s (A 600Mbit/s rate):**  The 600Mbit/s rate is the *maximum* theoretical speed of 802.11n, not a requirement for backward compatibility.

Therefore, a dual-radio device (supporting both 2.4GHz and 5GHz) is the *necessary* condition for 802.11n to be backward compatible with 802.11b.



"
Konbyen evènman medaye dò olenpik la te dwe naje nan jwèt Commonwealth yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Twa**.

The question states the athlete was supposed to swim 100m and 200m freestyle *and* three relay events. That's a total of three individual events (100m, 200m) plus three relay events, for a total of **six** events. However, the provided options don't include six. Since the question asks how many events the athlete *was supposed* to compete in, the answer is the number of individual events plus the number of relay events, which is 100m + 200m + 3 relay = **six**.
Since 6 is not an option, let's analyze the question again. It states: ""Meday lò olenmpik an te dwe naje 100m ak 200m naje lib epi nan twa relè nan Jwèt Commonwealth yo..."" This clearly indicates 100m and 200m are individual events, and the ""twa relè"" are three relay events. The total number of events is therefore 2 + 3 = 5. However, it's still not an option.

I apologize, there appears to be an error in the provided options. Based on the text, the athlete was supposed to participate in **five** events.

However, going back to the context:

*   100m freestyle - 1 event
*   200m freestyle - 1 event
*   3 relay events - 3 events
*   Total: 1 + 1 + 3 = **5**

So the answer should be **A: Senk**.
"
Poukisa medaye dò olenpik la pa te pran medikaman pou doulè li?,"The correct answer is **D: Li pa otorize nan jwèt Commonwealth yo** (They are not authorized in the Commonwealth Games).

The passage explicitly states that the athlete couldn't take the necessary pain medication because they were banned for the games.  The other options contradict the information provided.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki te kapab mennen nan konfizyon sou aktivite tranbleman a?","The correct answer is **A: Prezans nyaj sonm** (Presence of dark ash).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nyaj nwa yo san rapò kèlkonk avèk yon aktivite vòlkanik te siyale nan baz montay lan. Nyaj yo te prezante yon risk konfizyon pou konnen si te gen veritabman yon eripsyon ki te fèt."" (Dark ash was reported at the base of the mountain with no apparent relation to volcanic activity. The ash presented a risk of confusion as to whether a volcanic eruption had actually occurred.)

The ash clouds made it difficult to determine if a real eruption had happened, leading to the confusion about seismic activity. The other options are not directly linked to the cause of the confusion described in the passage.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè yon chanjman faz te rive?","The correct answer is **C: Le 10 Mas**

The passage states: ""Enpòtans aktivite sismik lan se baz chanjman faz ki te fèt 10 mas la sou kote nòdès caldeira nan somè vòlkan an."" This translates to ""The importance of seismic activity is the basis of the phase change that was made on March 10th at the northeast caldera of the volcano.""
"
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo konsènan sonn linè Chandrayaan-1 an ki pa vre?,"The incorrect statement is **A: Òbitè ki te lanse sonn lan te gen yon ekipaj** (The orbiter that launched the probe had a crew).

Here's why:

* **Chandrayaan-1 was an uncrewed mission.** The probe was sent to the Moon by an orbiter, but neither the orbiter nor the probe itself had a crew of astronauts. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Sonn lan te gen nan li enstriman vital** (The probe had vital instruments): The passage explicitly states the probe carried three important scientific instruments.
* **C: Ekspilsyon sonn lan te reyisi** (The probe's ejection was successful): The passage states the probe was ejected and impacted the lunar surface.
* **D: Sonn lan te gen kote ki pentire** (The probe had painted areas): The passage clearly mentions the probe had the Indian national flag painted on all sides.



Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
"
Kilès nan deklarasyon ki annapre la yo ki dekri avèk presizyon sonn linè a?,"The correct answer is **C: Li te ejekte apati yon òbitè abite**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Òbitè linè san pilòt la Chandrayaan-1 te ejekte Sond Enpak Linè li a (sig anglè MIP)..."" This directly confirms that the probe was ejected from the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Li te ateri toupre pòl nò Lalin nan:** The passage explicitly states it crashed near the South Pole.
* **B: Aterisaj fòse li te yon siksè:** The passage describes it as a ""aterisaj an katastwòf"" (catastrophic landing), so it was not a success.
* **D: Li te pote de enstriman enpòtan anpil:** The passage says it carried *three* important scientific instruments.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki mezi pwoteksyon kont maladi a ki pral aplike an dènye?","The correct answer is **C: Vaksen kont ansefalit**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Plizyè milyon flakon vaksen kont ansefalite te pwomèt pa gouvènman an tou, sa ki pral ede pou prepare ajans sanitè yo pou lane pwochèn."" This indicates that the vaccine is a planned protective measure for the future.

While the other options (Pestisid, Kolektè kochon yo, and Rido kont moustik) were implemented, the passage indicates that the vaccine is being *promised* and will be used for future preparation, suggesting it's the last mentioned and perhaps the most significant long-term protective measure.
"
Kijan maladi a transfere bay moun?,"The correct answer is **A: Moustik yo (Mosquitoes)**.

The text states: ""Kochon yo transmèt maladi a bay lòm **pa entèmedyè moustik yo**."" This translates to ""Pigs transmit the disease to humans **through mosquitoes**.""
"
Echèk dezyèm fraz la ka mennen nan ki rezilta?,"The correct answer is **B: Yon dwa alavni pou inyon sivil moun menm sèks**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Echèk dezyèm fraz la, ki pwopoze entèdi inyon sivil yo ant moun ki gen menm sèks pral kapab san dout louvri pòt la ak inyon sivil yo alavni.""  This translates to: ""The failure of the second phrase, which proposes to prohibit civil unions between people of the same sex, will undoubtedly open the door to civil unions.""

Therefore, the failure of the clause directly leads to the possibility of allowing civil unions.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè yo te efase dezyèm fraz la?","The correct answer is **A: Pandan sesyon lejislatif la**.

The passage states: ""Te gen yon chanjman nan sesyon lejislatif la lè Chanm Reprezantan an te efase dezyèm fraz la..."" This indicates the deletion happened during a legislative session.
"
Ba kiyès yo divilge “Papye Panama” yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Laprès**.

The text states: ""Panama Papers"" se yon tèm jenerik ki siyifi anviwon dis milyon dokiman kabinè jiridik panameyen Mossack Fonseca, ki te fè objè yon fwit nan **laprès** nan prentan 2016.

While Mossack Fonseca *held* the documents, the documents were revealed through a leak *to the press*.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès laprès Britanik la te deklare ki t ap jere anpil nan konpayi yo te itilize pou kache richès yo?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Bank**.

The passage states: ""Jounal Britanik la The Guardian sigere ke Bank Alman te kontwole yon tyè nan 1200 konpayi fiktif ke yo itilize pou akonpli sa."" (The British newspaper The Guardian suggested that the German Bank controlled a third of the 1200 shell companies used to accomplish this.)
"
Kilès nan aksidan avyon annapre la yo ki te gen plis lanmò?,"The correct answer is **C: Aksidan avyon sou wout pou ale Ameni sot an Iran**.

The passage states: ""Mwa pase Iran te konnen pi gwo dezas ayeryen li le yon avyon ki ta pral nan peyi ameni te kraze e **lakoz lanmo 168 moun**."" This translates to ""Last month Iran knew its biggest air disaster was when an airplane that was going to a neighboring country crashed and **caused the death of 168 people**.""

The other options have lower death tolls:

*   A: Aksidan avyon sou wout pou ale Ameni sot an Iran (The same as C, but wording is slightly different)
*   B: Aksidan elikoptè lapolis la (3 dead)
*   D: Aksidan avyon nan Mashhad (17 dead)



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa yon rezon pou anpil aksidan ayeryen ki rive an Iran yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Yon mank bidjè ki pèmèt nouvo acha avyon** (A lack of budget that allows for new aircraft purchases).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the problem is with an aging and poorly maintained fleet.** This points directly to the condition of the existing aircraft.
* **The passage also mentions international sanctions preventing the purchase of new aircraft.** This is a contributing factor, but not the *primary* reason for the accidents.
* **An aging fleet and lack of maintenance are direct causes of accidents.**
* **While a lack of budget *could* contribute to both an aging fleet and poor maintenance, the passage highlights the existing state of the fleet as the immediate problem.**  The sanctions are a consequence of other issues, not the core reason for the accidents themselves.

Therefore, the lack of budget is a contributing factor but not the *most direct* or primary reason for the high number of accidents.  The other options are directly cited as problems.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa te enkli nan rapò Gwoup Etid Irak la?,"The correct answer is **B: Yon deklarasyon ki endike ak sèten chanjman, vyolans k ap grandi nan Irak la ka evite.**

Here's why:

* The report explicitly states it **does not guarantee** that action in Iraq will stop the civil war or escalating violence. Option B suggests the report *does* indicate violence can be avoided, which contradicts the report's cautious and critical tone.

Let's look at why the other options *were* included:

* **A: Kritik politik aktyèl la:** The question states the report is ""kritik anpil sou sijè prèske tout aspè politik aktyèl ekzekitif la konsènan Irak.""
* **C: Rekòmandasyon pou sekirize fwontyè Irak yo:** The question specifically mentions the report's first recommendation is a new diplomatic initiative to secure Iraq's borders.
* **D: Yon pledwaye pou yon konsansis Ameriken:**  The question states the report opens with a debate in the US and the creation of an agreement on US policy in the Middle East. This implies a plea for American consensus.



"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo Gwoup Etid Irak la pa te mande avèk ensistans nan rapò li a?,"The correct answer is **A: Pou yo deklare yon garanti pou sispann devlopman vyolans lan.**

The text explicitly states that the study group *does not* guarantee that action in Iraq can stop the civil war, violence, or evolving chaos. Therefore, they did not demand a guarantee of stopping violence.

The study group *did* demand:

*   **B: Yon chanjman imedya nan direksyon** (A rapid change in direction)
*   **C: Itilizasyon deba ouvè** (The opening of a public debate)
*   **D: Etablissement yon nouvo inisyativ diplomatik** (The establishment of a new diplomatic initiative)



"
"Dapre lapolis, kimoun ki te konsidere kòm yon bra dwat Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Lapolis te deklare Lo Piccolo te gen pouvwa paske l te gen bra dwat Provenzano nan Palerme..."" This directly indicates that Lo Piccolo was considered Provenzano's right-hand man.
"
"Dapre enfòmasyon yo bay nan pasaj la, kisa ki te kòz lanmò Falcone?","The correct answer is **D: Paolo Borsellino yon lèt kwaze Mafya parèy li te touye l**.

The passage states: ""...mafya Giovanni Falcone ak Paolo Borsellino an 1992.""  This implies they were both killed by the Mafia, and the phrasing ""kwaze mafya"" indicates they were targeted by the Mafia. While the passage mentions the war against Riina as a context, it doesn't directly state Riina *killed* them. The most accurate interpretation based *only* on the provided text is that they were killed by the Mafia.
"
Kilès nan sa ki annapre la yo ki pa youn nan distenksyon Hitoshi Saito yo?,"The correct answer is **B: c Prezidan komite pou tout Federasyon Japonèz Jido**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Hitoshi Saito was the **president of the training committee of the Japanese Judo Federation** in his last moments. It *doesn't* say he was president of the entire federation.
* The text mentions he won a **gold Olympic medal** (C).
* The text mentions he was a former **world champion** (A).
* The text mentions he was a **judo expert** (D) because of his achievements.



Therefore, option B is the incorrect statement about Hitoshi Saito's distinctions.



"
Kikote Iwasaki te reyisi evite pwononse ve?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepal**.

The text states: ""li te sove pou l pa te marye nan peyi Nepal..."" which translates to ""he was saved because he wasn't married in Nepal..."" This means he avoided a negative outcome (likely imprisonment or further trouble) by not marrying there.
"
Kimoun ki te atake Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Yon chen**.

The passage states: ""yon chen anraje te atake li nan Tibè"" which translates to ""an enraged dog attacked him in Tibet.""
"
Kilè Alonso te fini kous li a?,"The correct answer is **C: Apre Schumacher te fini pwòp kous li**.

The text states: ""Fernando Alonso ki nan menm ekip avek li te devan pandan yon bon pati nan kous la, men li fini jis apre li fin kanpe bo stann lan kapab **paske li te gen yon kawoutchou devan dwat li ki pat byen sere**. **Michael Schumacher te fini kous li pa lontan apre Alonso**, akoz sispansyon nan batay yo anpil pandan kous la.""

This clearly indicates Alonso finished after Schumacher.
"
Kisa ki te lakòz Schumacher fini kous li byen bonè?,"The correct answer is **D: Domaj nan sispansyon machin nan**.

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher te fini kous li pa lontan apre Alonso, **akoz sispansyon nan batay yo anpil pandan kous la**."" This directly indicates that damage to the suspension caused Schumacher to finish the race early.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès ki gen responsablite fikse kosyon pou moun yo arete?","The correct answer is **D: Komisyonè tribinal la**.

The passage states: ""The Commissioner will set bail, if they agree with the charges brought by the arresting agent."" This directly indicates that the Commissioner is responsible for setting bail.
"
"Dapre lòd restriksyon tanporè ki mansyone nan pasaj la, kisa moun yo arete yo dwe gen dwa pou yo genyen pou yo kenbe yo pandan pi lontan pase 24 èdtan?","The correct answer is **C: Akizasyon ofisyèl Jij Glynn bay**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The Commissioner will set bail, if they agree with and formalize the accusations that the arresting officers bring forward.""  This means the key element for being held longer than 24 hours is a formal accusation from Judge Glynn.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kosyon** - Bail is *set* by the commissioner *after* the accusations are formalized, not the right to have it initially.
*   **B: Yon rankont avèk ofisye ki fè arestasyon an** - The passage doesn't mention a right to meet with arresting officers.
*   **D: Yon odyans** - While an audience is part of the process (for bail setting and a speedy trial), it's not the *initial* requirement to be held longer than 24 hours. The formal accusations are the trigger.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki rezon yo pa t itilize pou esplike anilasyon kous la?","The correct answer is **D: Ensètitid konstitisyonèl**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that diplomats claimed there wasn't enough clarity in the Afghan constitution to justify the cancellation. This directly addresses **insufficient constitutional clarity**.
* The passage mentions avoiding further bloodshed and security risks (A) as a reason for the decision, so that's not *why* it wasn't used as an explanation.
* The passage *contradicts* the idea that the cancellation was constitutional (B), so that's not a reason *why* it wasn't used.
* The passage doesn't mention cost (C) as a reason for the decision.



"
Poukisa diplomat yo finalman jije dezyèm tou a pa itil?,"The correct answer is **A: Li pa ale nan sans konstitisyon an (It did not align with the constitution).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diplomat yo te deklare yo pat twouve konfizyon sifizan nan konstitisyon afgàn lan pou detèmine debòdman an te initil."" This translates to: ""Diplomats declared they did not find sufficient ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to determine the annulment was useless.""  The reason it was deemed ineffective is that it didn't comply with the constitution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te gen risk pou sekirite (There was a security risk):** While security was a concern, the passage focuses on the constitutional aspect.
* **C: Te gen ensètitid nan konstitisyon an (There was ambiguity in the constitution):**  The diplomats *didn't* find sufficient ambiguity; they found enough clarity to say the annulment wasn't useful.
* **D: Eleksyon an te koute twòp kòb (The election cost too much money):** The passage doesn't mention cost as a factor.



"
Kiyès ki bay FATA yo sèvis jiridik?,"The correct answer is **B: Ajan Politik**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ajan endepandan Pakistan sou dominasyon britanik an 1947... te nome ""Ajan politik yo"" pou gouvènè FATA yo, k ap egzèse yon kontwòl endepandan prèske konplè sou rejyon yo. Ajan sa yo chaje pou bay sèvis gouvènmantal ak jidisyè yo..."" This directly indicates that the Political Agents are responsible for providing legal services (judicial) to FATA.
"
"""Kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki konsène """"Ajan Politik"""" FATA yo ki pa verite?""","The correct answer is **B: Se Prezidan Pakistan an ki te seleksyone yo (It was the President of Pakistan who selected them)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Depi endepandans Pakistan sou dominasyon britanik an 1947, prezidan pakistanè a te **nome** """"Ajan politik yo"""" pou gouvènè FATA yo..."" This means the President *appointed* them, not that they were selected *by* the President.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: Yo bay sèvis jidisyè (They provided judicial services):** The text states they were charged with providing both governmental and judicial services.
* **C: Yo respekte konstitisyon Pakistan an (They respected the Constitution of Pakistan):** The text mentions they provided services ""selon atik 247 konstitisyon pakistanè a"" (according to Article 247 of the Constitution of Pakistan).
* **D: Yo genyen kontwòl konplè sou sèten domèn (They had complete control over certain domains):** The passage states they exercised ""yon kontwòl endepandan prèske konplè sou rejyon yo"" (almost complete independent control over the regions).



"
Pou ki pri yo te nomine Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Pi bon Aktè fanm**. 

The text states that Emma Stone was nominated for Best Actress.
"
Pou ki pri fim nan pa t nomine?,"The correct answer is **B: Pi bon Efè Vizyèl**.

Here's why:

The question asks which category the film wasn't nominated for. The provided text lists all the categories the film *was* nominated for.  ""Pi bon Efè Vizyèl"" (Best Visual Effects) is not mentioned in the list. Therefore, the film was not nominated in that category.

The text *does* mention nominations for:

* Best Actor (Ryan Gosling)
* Best Actress (Emma Stone)
* Best Picture
* Director
* Cinematography
* Costume Design
* Editing
* Original Score
* Production Design
* Sound Editing
* Sound Mixing
* Original Songs (""The Fools Who Dream"" and ""City of Stars"")
* Lionsgate received the most nominations (26)



"
"Pami eleman sa yo, kiyès ki te rete an sèvis apre tranbleman te a?","The correct answer is **C: Tout sèvis chemen fè yo (All railway services)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""sèvis chimen fè a te kanpe nan zòn ki touche yo"" (railway service remained operational in the affected areas).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tout reyaktè ki nan santral Shika a nan rejyon Hokuriku (All reactors in the Shika plant in the Hokuriku region):** The text says reactors 1 and 2 *remained* standing, implying they were operational. However, it doesn't state *all* reactors were operational.
* **B: Ayewopò a nan Ishikawa (The airport in Ishikawa):** The text says ""ayewopò Noto a nan sikonskripsyon Ishikawa rete fèmen"" (Noto Airport in Ishikawa prefecture remained closed).
* **D: Yon santral nikleyè nan Niigata (A nuclear power plant in Niigata):** The text says the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata is functioning normally.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan eleman annapre yo tranbleman te a te domaje?","The correct answer is **C: Kèk wout (Some roads)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Gen kèk wout ki te detwi..."" which translates to ""Some roads were destroyed...""
* While the passage mentions water and power outages (affecting ""some houses""), it doesn't say the houses themselves were damaged.
* The passage explicitly states the reactors at the Shika plant *did not* suffer damage.
* The passage states that Noto Airport is closed, but the question asks what *was damaged*. Roads were *destroyed*, not just closed.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text is that some roads were damaged.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan pwoblèm sa yo ki pa enkli nan dokiman an?","The correct answer is **B: Koz gè 1967 la**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the document *will* refer to the border conflict based on the 1967 borders.
* The passage mentions the future of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley.
* The passage discusses the disagreement over Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley.
* However, it does **not** mention the cause of the 1967 war.

Therefore, the cause of the 1967 war is the only option not included in the document's subject matter as described.
"
Kiyès nan pwen sa yo ki pa yonn nan revandikasyon Palestine yo?,"The correct answer is **D: Senk lane prezans militè nan vale Jouden an**.

Here's why:

* The question states the document will reference Palestinian claims based on pre-1967 borders, the future of Jerusalem, and the Jordan Valley.
* The text explicitly mentions Israel demanding permanent military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years, while the PA is only willing to allow it for five.
* This means the *five-year* limit on the PA's military presence is a point of contention, *not* a core Palestinian claim itself.  Palestinians might be willing to negotiate a timeframe, but the fundamental claim is based on the pre-1967 borders.

The other options are all part of Palestinian claims:

* **A: Fwontyè baze sou kondisyon anvan gè yo** - This is a central Palestinian claim.
* **B: Prezans militè pèmanan nan vale Jouden an** - While the *duration* is disputed, the broader claim of Palestinian control or presence in the Jordan Valley is a Palestinian aspiration.
* **C: Repons konsènan lavni Jerusalem** - The status of Jerusalem is a fundamental and highly contested Palestinian claim.



"
Nan ki peyi Ma te etidye dwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Hong Kong**.

The text states: ""li te etidye nan **Inivèsite Nouyòk ak Fakilte Dwa Havard**.""  While Harvard is in the US, the text says he *studied* there, implying his education started in Hong Kong. The question asks where he studied *law*, and the text doesn't explicitly state the law school location. However, it does state he went to Harvard Law School, which is in the US. Given the options, and that Harvard is a well-known institution, the question is likely referring to where he *originally* studied law, which is implied to be Hong Kong.



However, this question is tricky because the text doesn't directly answer *where* he studied law. It lists institutions he attended, but not specifically the law school. But given the options, the most plausible answer is **A: Etazini** because Harvard Law School is located in the United States.

**Therefore, the best answer, considering the options, is A.** However, it's important to note the ambiguity in the original text."
"Dapre pasaj la, ki peyi ki te kontribye nan viktwa Ma nan eleksyon yo?","The correct answer is **A: Etazini**.

The passage states that Ma had a ""green card"" (permanent residency) in the United States. This implies a connection and potential support from the US, which contributed to his victory. While other locations are mentioned (Hong Kong, New York, Harvard, mainland China), the passage explicitly links the US residency to his electoral success.
"
"Jan yo di nan pasaj la, pou kiyès Carolyn Wilson t ap travay anvan li te kite vil la?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states: ""Lè lokatè yo te kòmanse pataje sa ki te rive yo a, majorite fanmi konsène yo te britsoukou reyalize Carolyn Wilson de **OHA** te vòlè depo garanti yo a epi te kite vil la."""
"Avèk kat kous ki rete nan sezon sa a, kiyès ki okipe katriyèm plas nan Chanpyona Pilòt yo?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

The passage states: ""Hamlin gen ven pwen deyò, men senk devan Bowyer..."" This means Bowyer is in fourth place.
"
"Apre kous yo mansyone nan pasaj la, konbyen pwen Kahne genyen nan Chanpyona Pilòt yo?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""...Kahne and Truex Jr. are fifth and sixth with 2,220 and 2,207 points.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, konbyen fwa moun te wè meteyorit k ap tonbe ke yo vin pwouve aprè ke se sou mas yo soti?","The correct answer is **D: Trant kat fwa**.

The passage states: ""Nou panse se senkyèm fwa nan listwa moun yo te obsève sa ki te revele se materyèl masyen chimikman konfime ki tonbe sou Tè a. Sou apeprè 24,000 meteyorit yo konnen ki tonbe sou Latè, yo verifye sèlman 34 ki gen orijin masyèn.""

This directly translates to ""We think this is the fifth time in human history that it has been revealed that the material that fell on Earth is chemically confirmed to be meteoric. Of approximately 24,000 known meteorites that fall on Earth, only 34 have been verified as being of meteoric origin.""

Therefore, only 34 out of 24,000 meteorites have been confirmed to be meteoric.  The question asks how many times meteorites were seen and *proven* to be meteoric. The passage explicitly states **34**.
"
"Jan sa mansyone nan pasaj la, kisa ki vrè sou wòch yo dekouvri ki gen orijin yo sou mas yo?","The correct answer is **D: Yo te 34**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Of these rocks, 15 have been attributed to the meteor shower that fell last July. **34 of these rocks have been verified as being of meteoric origin.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo te jwenn tout pandan lapli meteyorit mwa jiyè a:** The passage says 15 of the meteorites were attributed to the July meteor shower, but not all 34.
* **B: Yo te 24,000:** This is the total number of known meteorites, not the number of meteorites of meteoric origin.
* **C: Yo te vo $11,000 dola plis pase lò:** While some meteorites are worth significantly more than gold, the passage doesn't state that *all* of them are.  The price comparison is only given for some of the rare ones.



"
Kilè Schumacher te pran retrèt?,"The correct answer is **B: Apre setyèm viktwa li nan chanpyona** (After his seventh championship victory).

The text states: ""Schumacher te pran retrèt li an 2006 aprè li te fin ranpòte sèt fwa chanpyona Fòmil 1..."" which translates to ""Schumacher retired in 2006 after finishing with seven Formula 1 championships...""  While Felipe Massa's injury is mentioned, it's context for *who* replaced him, not the reason for Schumacher's retirement.
"
Kilè Massa te blese a?,"The correct answer is **A: Nan yon Grand Prix**.

The text states: ""Brezilyen an te soufri yon blesi nan tèt grav apre yon aksidan pandan Gwo Pri Ongwa 2009 la."" This directly indicates the injury happened during a Grand Prix.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki enpak aranjman yo ap gen sou AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Kantite itilizatè AOL yo ap egal a pa Yahoo e Microsoft yo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kantite itilizatè sèvis Yahoo yo! ak Microsoft mete ansanm pral rivalize avèk kantite kliyan AOL yo.""  This directly means that the combined user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft will be comparable to AOL's user base. This implies AOL's user base won't necessarily *decrease* but will be challenged and reach a similar size.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gen chans pou kantite itilizatè AOL yo ogmante** - The passage doesn't suggest AOL's users will increase; it focuses on them being *rivaled*.
*   **B: AOL ap sèl konpayi ki devlope mache mesajri elektwonik la** - The passage explicitly states that AOL *has* developed the market, but it doesn't claim they are the *only* company doing so.
*   **D: Yo p ap itilize AOL ankò Ozetazini** - The passage doesn't suggest users will stop using AOL; it focuses on the competitive landscape.



"
Kiyès nan sa ki annapre yo ki ka disparèt apre nouvo akò a?,"The correct answer is **C: Libète AOL pou devlope mache a jan li vle a**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jiska prezan, AOL pat kapab deplase epi devlope mache mesajri elektwonik lan nan pwòp rit pa l, akoz itilizasyon jeneralize l nan peyi Etazini. Avèk aranjman an plas sa, libète sa pral disparèt.""  This directly indicates that AOL's freedom to develop the market independently will be lost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Devlopman jeneralize entènèt nan Etazini:** The passage doesn't say that internet development will disappear.
* **B: Itilizasyon mache mesajri elektwonik la:**  The passage implies the *use* of the market will continue, just potentially under different control.
* **D: Alyans Yahoo ak Microsoft:** The passage discusses the *rivalry* between Yahoo and Microsoft and their combined user base, not the alliance itself disappearing.



"
Konbyen moun ki te mouri nan atak la ki pa te polisye?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

The text states that ""de ofisye polis te touye."" This means two police officers died. The question asks about non-police victims. The text doesn't mention any non-police casualties. Therefore, the number of non-police people who died is 0.
"
Kiyès ki te rapòte moun yo te sispèk ki fè atak la?,"The correct answer is **A: Lapolis (Police)**.

The text states: ""Komisè polis Chandra Shekhar Solanki te deklare akize yo te parèt nan tribinal la avèk vizaj yo kouvri.""  This means the police (specifically, Commissioner Solanki) is the one making the statement about the suspects appearing in court.  Therefore, they are the ones reporting on the suspects.
"
"Florida kòm etan yon eta kote moun ki genyen an ranpòte tout eleksyon an, kisa yo te bay Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Tout delege eta a**.

The text states: ""Antan ke yon eta gayan, Florida te bay Romney tout senkant delege li yo..."" This directly answers the question.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki pousantaj vòt Gingrich te fè nan eleksyon primè yo?","The correct answer is **B: 32 pousan**.

The passage states: ""Antan ke yon eta gayan, Florida te bay Romney tout senkant delege li yo, li mete l nan tèt lis pou envestiti pati Repibliken an. Antan ke yon eta gayan, Florida te bay Romney tout senkant delege li yo, li mete l nan tèt lis pou envestiti pati Repibliken an.

"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès ki pa t kontinye prezante apre rezilta konsèy la?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

The passage states: ""Bachmann ki genyen sondaj Ames Straw an mwa out deside mete fen a kanpay li."" This directly indicates that Bachmann stopped campaigning after the results.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès ki t ap fè lwanj pou yon lòt kandida apre rezilta konsèy la?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The passage states: ""Apre rezilta tonbe, Gingrich te glorifye Santowòm..."" which translates to ""After the results came in, Gingrich glorified Santowom...""

Therefore, Newt Gingrich is the one praising another candidate (Santowom).
"
Ki sèl kote emisyon an te prezante anvan 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: Radyo TogiNet**.

The text states: ""Ò kòmansman, emisyon a te pase sèlman sou sit radio entènèt Radio TogiNet..."" which translates to ""At the beginning, the show only aired on the internet radio site Radio TogiNet...""
"
Ki nivo estasyon an te di emisyon an genyen?,"The correct answer is **A: Amatè**.

The text states: ""Espektak la te mete an vedèt orijin aktè amatè yo..."" which directly translates to ""The show featured amateur actors..."" Therefore, the station's level was amateur.
"
Kisa David Headley te jwenn ki finalman te kontribye nan atak gwoup militan yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Enfòmasyon (Information)**.

The text states: ""Travay epi kolèk enfòmasyon David Headley yo te pèmèt operasyon 10 nèg ak zam nan gwoup militan pakistanè Laskhar-e-Taiba."" This translates to ""The work and collection of information by David Headley enabled the operation of 10 men and weapons in the Pakistani militant group Laskhar-e-Taiba.""

While the militants had grenades, weapons, and automatic guns, it was the *information* David Headley gathered that facilitated the operation.
"
Ki mwayen transpò gwoup militan yo te itilize pou yo ale Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Bato**.

"
Ki deklarasyon ki reflete ekzakteman rezilta match ki opoze Nadal ak Raonic nan Open Brisbane yo mansyone nan pasaj la?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic bat Nadal**.

The passage states that Nadal ""te pèdi dènyeman an kont Raonic nan Open Brisbane lan."" This translates to ""Nadal recently lost against Raonic at the Open Brisbane."" Therefore, Raonic won.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kijan klasman match ant Nadal ak Raonic lan te ye aprè premye sèvis la?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal fè 76 pwen**.

The passage states: ""Nadal te rekòlte 88% pwen nets yo nan match pandan l genyen 76 pwen nan premye sèvis la."" This directly tells us that Nadal had 76 points during his first serve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic fè 88% pwen net** - This is incorrect because the passage states *Nadal* had 88% net points.
*   **C: Match la te 7 a 2** - This refers to the head-to-head record, not the points during the match.
*   **D: Raonic bat Nadal** - While the passage mentions Nadal lost to Raonic recently, it doesn't state that Raonic won *this* particular match."
Ki emisyon lang yo pa enkli nan twa dènye emisyon Naked News yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Japonè**.

The text states that the new language program includes Spanish, Italian, and Korean. It also mentions that English and Japanese were already included. Therefore, Japanese is *not* one of the new three languages being added.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki kote nouvo emisyon Naked News yo p ap disponib?","The correct answer is **C: Nan sinema**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the new Naked News programs will be available on:

*   Television
*   Internet
*   Electronic devices

It *doesn't* mention cinema as a platform. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
Konbyen konpetitè ki pa t fini Slalom Giant lan?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The question specifically asks how many competitors did *not* finish the Slalom Giant course. The text states: ""et 45 nan 117 eskyè yo nan slalom jeyan an pat reyisi klase nan kous lan."" which translates to ""and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to finish the race.""
"
Kiyès nan deklarasyon annapre yo ki reflete ekzakteman rezilta kous Chanpyona yo?,"The best answer is **B: 45 patisipan pa t fini kous yo nan Giant Slalom nan.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""et 45 nan 117 eskyè yo nan slalom jeyan an pat reyisi klase nan kous lan."" (and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to finish the race.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nan dezyèm kous la, Carpenado te fini devan yon atlèt ongwa:**  While the text mentions Kat Eskyez (a Hungarian athlete) in the Giant Slalom, it *doesn't* say Carpenado finished ahead of her. It only says Eskyez didn't finish.
* **C: Gen plis patisipan ki fini Giant Slalom nan olye de Slalom nan:** We know 36 out of 116 Slalom skiers didn't finish. We know 45 out of 117 Giant Slalom skiers didn't finish. Therefore, there were *more* people who didn't finish the Giant Slalom than the Slalom. This statement is false.
* **D: Carpenado te fini an dizyèm nan Slalom nan:** The text states Carpenado finished 2nd in the Giant Slalom, not the Slalom.

Therefore, option B is the only one that is directly and accurately supported by the provided text.



"
"Kilès nan tout sa yo, NBA a te deside sispann?","The correct answer is **A: Sezon baskètbòl la**.

The passage states: ""NBA te kanpe sezon baskètbòl li an akoz enkyetid yo konsènan COVID-19 la."" This directly indicates the entire season was suspended. While a player from Utah Jazz tested positive, the suspension was of the season, not just the player.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki te fè NBA enkyete pou viris la?","The correct answer is **D: Yon jwè nan Utah Jazz te teste pozitif**.

The passage states: ""Desizyon NBA a fè aprè tès pozitif yon jwè jazz Utah pou viris COVID-19 lan."" This directly indicates that a player on the Utah Jazz tested positive. Option D accurately reflects this information.
"
Kiyès ki te fè gòl ki te pèmèt Washington Capitals genyen nan match li t ap jwe kont Atlanta Thrashers la?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The question states: ""Premye pas Ovechkin nan aswè a te gòl viktwa jèn rekrite a Nicklas Backstrom"". This directly answers the question of who scored the goal that put Washington Capitals in the lead.
"
Kiyès ki te fè 60yèm gòl li nan sezon an nan match Capitals ak Thrashers la?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The question states directly: ""Dezyèm gòl li fè aswè a se 60tyèm gòl li pou sezon an..."" which refers to Alex Ovechkin.
"
Kilè Bank Northern Rock te bezwen sipò gouvènman an?,"The correct answer is **D: Pandan kriz ipotekè a**.

The text states: ""Northern Rock te gen bezwen soutyen lakoz aparisyon lè kriz prè imobilye ak ris yo an 2007."" This translates to ""Northern Rock needed support due to the emergence of a mortgage and risk crisis in 2007."" Therefore, the bank needed government support *during* the mortgage crisis.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki pi byen dekri relasyon ki genyen ant Virgin Group ak bank Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: Virgin Group te achte bank lan apre natiralizasyon li.**

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Virgin te sèlman achte ‘good bank’ nan Northern Rock, se pa sosyete jesyon aktif yo.""  This directly translates to ""Virgin only bought the 'good bank' of Northern Rock, not the asset management company.""
* The passage also mentions that the bank was nationalized in 2008.
* Therefore, Virgin Group's purchase happened *after* the bank was nationalized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Virgin Group te achte sosyete ki t ap jere aktif Northern Rock yo tou:** The passage explicitly states they *didn't* buy the asset management company.
* **C: Virgin Group te ofri bank lan yon èd dijans pandan kriz ipotekè a:** The passage mentions Virgin made an offer to *buy* the bank, not offer emergency aid.
* **D: Premye òf Virgin Group pou bank lan te fèt apre natiralizasyon bank lan:** While the purchase happened after nationalization, the passage doesn't say the *first offer* was after nationalization. It only says they made an offer that was rejected *before* nationalization.



"
"Jan yo presize nan pasaj la, ki peyi ki afekte ak siyati akò Kyoto sou klima a?","The correct answer is **A: Etazini**.

The passage explicitly states that the decision was about Mr. Roud's decision *for the US* not to sign the Kyoto climate accord, making the US the country directly affected by the lack of ratification.
"
A kisa ansyen gouvènman Ostraliyen an te panse ratifikasyon pwotokòl Kyoto a t ap nwi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekspòtasyon chabon**.

The passage explicitly states that the former Australian conservative government didn't want to ratify Kyoto because it believed it would harm their reliance on coal exports.
"
Pou ki pwogram yo te angaje tirè yo?,"The correct answer is **D: Pwogram Lachas Asosyasyon Tirè Espòtif yo** (Sporting Shooters Association of Australia hunting program).

The text explicitly states: ""Nan kad yon patenarya ak NPWS ak **Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, benevòl kalifye yo te rekrite, nan kad pwogram chas Sporting Shooters Association**."" This translates to: ""In the framework of a partnership with NPWS and the **Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program**.""
"
Ki deklarasyon ki pa koresponn ekzakteman a tès pou lit kont parazit la?,"The answer is **A: Se te premye tès nan pwogram nan, yo pa t evalye li (It was the first test of the program, it was not evaluated.)**

Here's why:

* The text states the experience *was* evaluated for its control and effectiveness (""eksperyans sa te kontwole ak efikasite l evalye""). Therefore, statement A is the only one that contradicts the provided information.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B: Patisipan yo te resevwa enstriksyon fòmasyon (Participants received training instructions):** The text explicitly says, ""kat moun ki konn tire yo ke yo te seleksyone pou premye operasyon an te resevwa konsif ak fòmasyon konplè sou sekirite (the skilled shooters who were selected for the first operation received comprehensive safety briefing and training).""
* **C: Gen rangers ki te ankadre patisipan yo (There were rangers supervising the participants):** The text mentions a partnership with NPWS and the role of rangers (""Nan kad yon patenarya ak NPWS...""), implying ranger involvement in the operation.
* **D: Yo te seleksyone kat patisipan (Four participants were selected):** The text states, ""kat moun ki konn tire yo ke yo te seleksyone pou premye operasyon an (four skilled shooters were selected for the first operation).""



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki kote yo te jwenn fant lan?","The correct answer is **A: Nan vale Rift la**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Daprè fosil sa, sa vle di ke separasyon an fèt pi bonè ke jan prèv molekilè yo vle fè san antann. Sa vle di tout bagay yo dwe retounen,"" te di chèchè nan Rift Valley Rechèch Sèvis nan peyi Letiopi ak yon ko-otè nan etid la, Berhane Asfaw.""  This indicates the discovery was made in the Rift Valley. While the research was conducted in Ethiopia, the *location* of the discovery is the Rift Valley.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki pase pi vit ke yo te prevwa?","The correct answer is **B: Divizyon an**.

The quote states: ""Daprè fosil sa, sa vle di ke separasyon an fèt pi bonè ke jan prèv molekilè yo vle fè san antann."" This translates to: ""According to this fossil, it means the separation happened earlier than the molecular evidence wants to agree.""  Therefore, the separation happened sooner than expected.
"
Kisa yon jwè dwe fè pou l ka manipile mouvman yo nan yon jwèt videyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Pozisyone l an triyang**.

The passage states: ""kontwolè a itilize de kaptè plase tou prè televizè itilizatè a pou **triyangile pozisyon l nan espas tridimansyonèl la**."" This means the player needs to position themselves in a triangular configuration with the console and the controllers.
"
Kisa ki te fèt pou l sanble ak yon rimòt televizyon?,"The correct answer is **B: Manèt Nintendo Revolution lan**.

The passage states: ""Sanble ak yon remòt televizyon, kontwolè a..."" which translates to ""Similar to a remote television, the controller...""  Therefore, the controller (manèt) is what resembles a remote.
"
Kisa ki pa t mansyone nan dènye rapò ajans près Xinhua a?,"The correct answer is **B: Avyon an ateri Ürümqi**.

The question asks what was **not** mentioned in the latest Xinhua report. The report *did* mention the plane refusing an emergency landing in Ürümqi. Therefore, the statement that the plane landed in Ürümqi was *not* mentioned in the report.
"
Kisa ki pa t mansyone nan premye rapò ajans près Xinhua a?,"The correct answer is **B: Yo te refize avyon an yon aterisaj dijans**.

Here's why:

The question asks what wasn't mentioned in the *initial* report by Xinhua. The passage *does* state that the plane *refused* an emergency landing in Ürümqi.  Therefore, B is the correct answer as it is the only option not explicitly mentioned as part of the initial report.
"
Kisa Sara Danius te anonse pandan emisyon radyo a?,"The correct answer is **D: Komite a ap sispann fè efò pou antre an kontak ak Bob Dylan.**

The passage states: ""te abandone efò yo pou jwenn li"" and ""Mwen te rele epi voye imel ak pi pwòch kolaboratè l epi mwen te resevwa repons ki senpatik anpil. Pou kounya, sa san dout pa sifi."" This indicates the committee gave up trying to reach Bob Dylan.
"
Kiyès yo pa t ka jwenn?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The text explicitly states that the Nobel Committee was unable to reach Bob Dylan directly. While Sara Danius attempted to contact his close collaborators, the committee ultimately couldn't get in touch with Dylan himself.
"
"""Kiyès ki te kòmante ki di ke angajman an se yon """"etap enpòtan""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The text states: ""Pòt pawòl Bush la, Gordon Johndroe kalifye pwomès Kore Di Nò """"de etap majè, nan objektif denikleyarizasyon ke yo ka verifye sou penensil koreyen an."""""" This directly indicates that Gordon Johndroe made the comment about the commitment being a ""major step.""
"
Konbyen tenb Słania te pwodui pou divès peyi?,"The correct answer is **D: Plis pase 1,000**.

The text states: ""Li te pwodwi plis pase 1,000 tenb pou Swèd epi 28 lòt peyi."" which translates to ""He produced more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki koz posib ki fè gen devèsman nan tou ki nan rezèvwa a?","The correct answer is **B: Yon tès woutin sistèm kòmandman yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Aprè yon tès routin sou sistèm kòmandman ensandi yo, gen yon pàn kouran tou swuit apre ki anclanche ouvèti vàn sekirite yo epi pwovoke debòdman petwòl brit la tou prè estasyon 9 Fò Grili."" This directly links the test of the fire control system to the opening of the safety valves and the subsequent oil spill.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lè zòn konfinman segondè a ranpli a tout kapasite l:** The passage says there's still empty space in the secondary containment area.
* **C: Ekspansyon tèmik:** Thermal expansion is mentioned as a *contributing factor* to the continued flow from the containment area, but not the *initial cause* of the spill.
* **D: Dife nan yonn nan estasyon ponpaj Fort Greely yo:** The passage mentions a power outage during the test, but not a fire.



"
Poukisa soupap sekirite yo ouvri?,"The correct answer is **B: Te gen yon pàn kouran ki pwodui apre yon tès nan sistèm nan.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Aprè yon tès routin sou sistèm kòmandman ensandi yo, gen yon pàn kouran tou swuit apre ki anclanche ouvèti vàn sekirite yo..."" This directly links the power outage and the opening of the safety valves.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te gen yon dilatasyon tèmik anndan rezèvwa yo:** While thermal expansion caused the containment area to continue leaking, it didn't *cause* the safety valves to open initially.
*   **C: Rezèvwa yo te plen:** The passage says a large portion of the reserve was *not* full.
*   **D: Zòn konfinman segondè a pa t ka kenbe ase baril:** The passage states the containment area *could* hold a significant amount of oil.



"
Ki wotè dlo a ye kounye a nan Ninth Ward ?,"The correct answer is **C: Wotè senti** (Le wotè senti nan dlo a).

Here's why:

* The text states the water is currently ""jous nan gwosè l"" (up to its size) in the Ninth Ward.
* It also mentions the levee overflowed and the water is overflowing a 100-foot wide section.
* While the levee's height was previously 20 feet during Katrina, the current height of the water *within* the Ninth Ward is not explicitly stated. It's overflowing and the text indicates its height is significant, relative to the levee. Therefore, ""Wotè senti"" best describes the current situation.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 20 pye:** This refers to the height of the levee during Katrina, not the current water level.
* **B: 6 pous:** This refers to the estimated impact of a 6-inch flood on old digs, which is irrelevant to the current water level in the Ninth Ward.
* **D: 100 pye:** This is the width of the section of the levee that's overflowing, not the height of the water.



"
"Pandan siklòn Katrina a, kisa ki te pase Ninth Ward?","The best answer is **B: Dlo bay moun nan senti ap debòde dig la.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The Ninth Ward, which knew floods reached 20 feet high during Hurricane Katrina, is currently underwater to its full extent because a neighboring levee overflowed."" This directly indicates the levee overflowed and caused flooding.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: Dlo inondasyon yo kouvri 100 pye de lajè:** While the passage mentions the flooding is 100 feet wide, this doesn't explain *why* it's flooded.  It's a result, not the cause.
* **C: Dlo inondasyon yo rive jiska 20 pye de wotè:** The passage *mentions* the floods reached 20 feet during Katrina, but this is background information. The question asks about what *happened* to the Ninth Ward *during* Katrina, not just a fact about the storm.
* **D: 6 pous lapli ouvri yon brèch nan dig ki andomaje yo:** The 6 inches of rain *contributed* to the problem, but the passage says the neighboring levee *overflowed* due to the rain. The overflow is the direct cause of the flooding.



"
Kiyès nan sa yo Hamilton pa t konfime?,"The correct answer is **A: Kote pasyan an te vwayaje a (Where the patient traveled to)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Malad la pat ale Nijerya, kote kèk ka viris Ebola te pwodwi."" (The patient did not travel to Nigeria, where some cases of Ebola virus were produced.)
* **The question asks what Hamilton did *not* confirm.** Hamilton confirmed the patient was in stable health, that infection control protocols were followed, and the patient's current health status.  They *didn't* confirm where the patient *had* traveled, only where they *hadn't* traveled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Posibilite ki genyen pou lòt pasyan pran viris la (The possibility of other patients catching the virus):** The text mentions protocols were in place to *prevent* this, implying it *was* considered and addressed.
* **C: Si yo te swiv pwotokòl ki apwopriye a ou pa (Whether appropriate protocols were followed or not):** The text states protocols *were* followed.
* **D: Eta sante aktyèl pasyan an (The patient's current health status):** The text explicitly states the patient was in stable health.



"
Ki bagay syantifik yo vle dekouvri?,"The best answer is **D: Kijan tè a fòme (How the Earth formed)**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph explicitly states:** ""Syantifik yo espere konprann kòman planèt yo fòme, epi sitou kòman latè te fòme piske komèt yo antre an kolizyon avèk latè sa gen lontan."" (Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, and especially how the Earth formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.)

While the other options are mentioned, they are supporting details *related to* understanding how the Earth formed. The primary goal scientists have is to understand the Earth's formation process in the context of comet impacts.

Therefore, option D is the most encompassing and accurate answer to the question ""Ki bagay syantifik yo vle dekouvri?"" (What do scientists want to discover?).
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki wòl lapolis nan zòn nan te jwe nan fèmti a?","The correct answer is **C: Yo te oryante chofè yo lòt kote**.

The passage states: ""80 polisye te pèmèt dirije chofè yo nan detou yo."" This directly indicates that the police guided drivers to alternative routes.
"
Sa k te pase antre tib la pandan fèmti a?,"The correct answer is **A: Yo te bloke**.

The passage states: ""Kamyon baskil yo te itilize pou bloke antre tib asistans yo..."" which translates to ""Butter tankers were used to block the entrances to the assistance tunnels...""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki pa te pase anvan machin nan te frape fotograf la?","The correct answer is **A: Patwouy sou wout la te òdone fotograf la pou l retounen travèse otowout la.**

The passage explicitly states: ""daprè lapolis, chofè veyikil ki te frape fotograf la pwobab pou li pa fè fas ak akizasyon kriminèl. **Patwouy sou wout la te òdone fotograf la pou l repase, de fwa.**""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fotograf la te pakin machin li sou boulva Sepulveda a:** The passage mentions he pulled over on Sepulveda Boulevard, but it doesn't say he *parked*.
* **C: Fotograf la te pran foto yon kontwòl lapolis:** There's no mention of him photographing a police stop.
* **D: Fotograf la te rive pran yon foto Bieber:** The passage mentions a photo of Bieber being taken, but it doesn't state the photographer took that photo *before* being hit. It just mentions a photo of Bieber was included with the TMZ report.



"
Kisa fotograf la t ap eseye fè anvan machin te frape l la?,"The correct answer is **A: Pake sou boulva Sepulveda**.

The text states: ""TMZ news site includes a photo of the photographer who **pulled over his car** on Sepulveda Boulevard and took photos of the police arrest before crossing the road and continuing...""
"
Ki deklarasyon ki pa dekri kòrèkteman eta sante prezidan an apre li teste pozitif a viris la?,"The correct answer is **A: Li pa santi l byen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Eta prezidan an estab... Apa lafyèv ak gòj fè mal, mwen santim byen..."" which translates to ""The President is stable... He has fever and a sore throat, I feel well...""

Therefore, the president *does* feel well, not unwell. Options B, C, and D are all directly supported by the text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki konsène prezidan an ki verite?","The correct answer is **C: Li santi l byen ase pou l travay a distans.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mwen santim byen epi an fòm pou fè travay mwen travay a distans."" (I feel well and in shape to do my work work remotely.) This directly supports option C.
* **The passage states:** ""Eta prezidan an estab..."" (The President is stable...) This supports the idea that the virus isn't causing severe illness.
* **The passage states:** ""li pral izole lakay li pandan plizyè jou."" (he will be isolated at home for several days.) This contradicts option B.
* **The passage states:** ""Apa lafyèv ak gòj fè mal..."" (I have a slight fever and sore throat...) This contradicts option A and D, which suggest he is not feeling well or that the virus is attacking him severely.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè siklòn twopikal Gonu ta dwe kontinye pèdi fòs?","The correct answer is **A: Anvan l rive sou zile Maldiv**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nan kòmansman jounen an, van yo te anviwon 83 km/è, epi nou te atann nou yo t ap kontinye vin pi fèb.""  This implies the wind was expected to weaken *before* reaching the Maldives. The passage also mentions the wind speed at its peak (240 km/h), but this is not directly linked to when the weakening would occur. Options B, C, and D are not supported by the information provided.
"
A ki vitès van yo te soufle lè siklòn Gonu te rive nan limit maksimòm li?,"The correct answer is **B: 240 kilomèt alè**.

The passage states: ""Nan kòmansman jounen an, van yo te anviwon 83 km/è, epi nou te atann nou yo t ap kontinye vin pi fèb."" and ""Nan kòmansman jounen an, van yo te anviwon 83 km/è, epi nou te atann nou yo t ap kontinye vin pi fèb."" and ""ki vini ak yon van 240 kilomèt a lè (149 miles a lè).""  This means the wind speed at its maximum was 240 kilometers per hour. The 149 miles per hour is just a conversion.
"
Kiyès nan sa yo ke yo pa konsidere kòm yon karakteristik Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **C: Li gen plizyè selil (It has multiple cells)**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that *Karenia brevis* is a **unicellular** marine animal.
*   Options A, B, and D are all mentioned as characteristics of *Karenia brevis* in the text.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* a characteristic of *Karenia brevis* is having multiple cells.



"
"Nan tout sa yo, kisa Karena brevis pa ka fè?","The correct answer is **B: Kantite yo ogmante rapidman nan nenpòt ki kondisyon**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that **natural factors combine to create ideal conditions that *allow* the algae to increase significantly**. It doesn't say they can increase rapidly in *any* condition. This implies that specific conditions are needed for rapid growth.
* The passage explicitly states that Karenia brevis **produces a neurotoxin**.
* The passage mentions that the toxin **can deactivate the nerves of humans and fish**, and that fish often die due to high toxin concentrations.
* The passage states humans can be affected by breathing in contaminated water.

Therefore, the algae's rapid growth isn't guaranteed in all conditions, unlike its ability to produce toxins or affect marine life and humans.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan sa yo ki pa t fèt akoz siklòn Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: Inondasyon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""maint même si pour l’instant il n’y a pas signalé de dommages ou d’inondations."" This translates to ""even though for now there are no reported damages or floods.""

The passage explicitly mentions rain, thunderstorms, and lightning as consequences of the storm. However, it states that there are *no reported floods*. Therefore, flooding did not occur.
"
Kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki fo konsènan siklòn Felicia?,"The correct answer is **A: Lapli li bay la bon pou Oahu**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Presipitasyon an, ki atenn 6.34 pous nan yon enstriman mezi sou Oahu, te dekri kòm """"benefik"""".""  This directly supports option A.
* **B: Yo te dabò klase li kòm depresyon twopikal anvan li transfòme an tanpèt kategori 4:** The text says it weakened to a tropical depression *before* becoming a Category 4 hurricane. This is incorrect.
* **C: Pifò nan zile yo te resevwa lapli:** The text says ""Debri li yo pwovoke gwo lapli nan pifò zile yo."" This is true, but option A is a more specific and accurate statement based on the information given.
* **D: Kèk ti lapli te gen kout zeklè akonpanye yo:** The text states ""Yon pati presipitasyon yo te akonpaye oraj ak anpil zeklè."" This is true, but option A is more focused on the benefit of the rain.



"
Ki deklarasyon ki pi byen reflete rezilta Grand Prix a nan Ongri an 2009 ?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo te revoke Piquet Jr. apre sa.**

The question states that Piquet Jr. was *revoked* after the Hungarian Grand Prix 2009.  The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
Kilè aksidan an te fèt?,"The correct answer is **A: Touswit apre machjn Alonzo a te kanpe (Immediately after Alonso's car had braked)**.

The question states Piquet Jr. crashed *just after a braking maneuver by Fernando Alonso*. Option A accurately reflects this timing. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan sa yo ki te pran mwens tan ke sa espesyalis yo panse yo t ap pran odepa?","The correct answer is **A: Fòmasyon espès la (Formation of the species)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that scientists thought the formation of a new species would take a longer time, but it actually happened in just two generations. This indicates the formation of the species was faster than initially anticipated.
* The passage explicitly mentions the reproduction between the Darwin's finch and the Geospiza conirostris finch, which is a part of the evolutionary process.
* The report on the species (B) is separate from the time it took for the species to evolve.
* While evolution is involved (D), the specific timeframe mentioned is for the *formation* of the new species, not the general evolutionary process.

Therefore, the formation of the species itself took less time than the scientists initially believed.
"
Kiyès nan sa yo chèchè yo pa t rapòte?,"The correct answer is **C: Non nouvo espès yo**.

Here's why:

* **The text states the researchers identified a *new species* of bird.** It doesn't explicitly name the new species.
* **The text *does* mention:**
    * **A:** Where the new species formed (Galapagos Islands)
    * **B:** The timeframe of evolution (only two generations)
    * **D:** The birds involved (Darwin's finch and Geospiza conirostris cactus finch)

Therefore, the only information the researchers *didn't* report is the name of the new species.
"
Ki kote CowParade la te fèt?,"The correct answer is **B: Nan vil Bikarès**

The text explicitly states: ""Evènman atistik la se yon pati nan yon kanpay meri Bukares la..."" which translates to ""The artistic event is part of a campaign by the Bucharest City Hall..."" and later mentions Bucharest being the first in southeastern Europe to host the event.
"
Kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki pi byen dekri CowParade la?,"The best answer is **D: Se pi gwo aktivite atistik piblik ki fèt nan mond lan.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Vil la ap premye nan sid ès Ewòp la ki akeyo, ant jwen ak out ane saa, defile cheval yo, pi gwo evenman atistik piblik nan mond la."" (The city is the first in southeastern Europe to welcome, between June and August, the parade of horses, the largest public artistic event in the world.)

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

* **A: ""Li dewoule sèlman nan vil yo konsidere ki """"kreyatif"""" yo""** - The passage doesn't mention this limitation.
* **B: Se meri Bikarès ki te kreye li** - The passage states it's part of a Bucharest mayoral campaign, but it doesn't directly say the municipality *created* it.
* **C: Se yon aktivite atistik ki fèt nan sezon lete nan pati sidès Lewòp** - While this is true, it's not the *best* description of what CowParade *is*. It's more than just a summer event in a specific region.



"
Kisa ki te pouse Larisi kanpe sou itilizasyon II-76 yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Twoup enteryè**.

The text states that the Il-76 is a troop transport aircraft operated by internal troops. The question asks *why* Russia persisted in using them.  The text doesn't directly say a specific reason beyond their use by internal troops. While the accident is mentioned, it's presented as context for the *demand for an investigation*, not the reason for continued use.  The Soviet/Russian army history is relevant background, but not the primary reason *why they continued to use them*. The investigation is a consequence of the accident, not a reason for using the aircraft.



"
Kisa II-76 la ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Yon avyon**.

The text explicitly states: ""Il-76 a se yon gwo konpozan lame ris ak sovyetik la depi lane 1970 yo, epi te deja konnen yon gwo aksidan an Risi mwa dènye a."" This directly identifies the Il-76 as an aircraft.
"
Kiyès ki te angaje ekip senaris la pou The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

The passage states: ""Nan lane 1989, li [Simon] te patisipe nan kreyasyon Simpsons avèk Brooks and Groening, epi te responsab bay travay ak premye ekip redaksyon seri a."" This indicates that both Brooks and Groening were involved in creating The Simpsons, and the question asks who was *engaged* to form the writing team. While Simon was involved in building the writing team, the passage explicitly names Groening alongside Brooks. Therefore, Groening is the more direct answer to the question.
"
"Dapre Fluke, kiyès ki te voye kòmantè pozitif ak ankourajman pou li?","The correct answer is **D: Moungason kou fanm**. 

The text states: ""Li te rive nan konklizyon sa akoz plizyè kòmantè pozitif ak ankourajman yo moun yo te voye ba li..."" and then continues with ""...gason ak fanm yo mande pou medikaman kontraseptif yo konsidere tankou yon nesesite medikal."" This clearly indicates both men and women sent positive comments and encouragement.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, de kisa anpil moun pa te renmen pou medam yo pale?","The correct answer is **C: Sante fanm**.

The passage states that the effort to silence women speaking about women's health failed *because* of positive comments and encouragement, and because people (men and women) were asking for contraception to be considered a medical necessity. This implies that the initial effort was aimed at suppressing discussion of women's health.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki kò planetè ki pi dinamik?","The correct answer is **A: Latè**.

The passage states: ""Daprè sa nou konnen, gen yon sèl kò planetè ki egziste ki pi dinamik ke Titan, non li se latè."" which translates to ""According to what we know, there is one existing planetary body that is more dynamic than Titan, its name is Earth.""
"
Sou ki kò planèt yo te rive idantifye rivyè ak lak ki fòme ak yon likid transparan?,"The correct answer is **D: Satin**.

Here's why:

Stofan's statement says: ""Li pral konpòte li menm jan ak dlo, li klè tankou dlo. Donk, si ou twouve w sou rivaj la, ou kapab wè galèt yo oswa kras ki twouve yo nan fon an."" This describes a planet with rivers and lakes made of a transparent liquid, similar to water.

The statement also says: ""Daprè sa nou konnen, gen yon sèl kò planetè ki egziste ki pi dinamik ke Titan, non li se latè."" This implies that Earth is the planet with rivers and lakes made of a transparent liquid.

However, the question asks about the planet where rivers and lakes made of a transparent liquid *were identified*. The answer to that is **Satin** as per the text. The text states that the planet is identified as Satin and it has rivers and lakes made of a transparent liquid, making it the planet where rivers and lakes made of a transparent liquid were identified.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Jipitè (Jupiter)** is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface with rivers and lakes like Earth.
*   **Titan** is a moon of Saturn, not a planet, and its surface is covered in liquid methane and ethane, not water.
*   **Solèy la (The Sun)** is a star, not a planet, and doesn't have rivers or lakes.



"
Kiyès nan rezilta sa yo ki pa rezilta dekouvèt yon plim?,"The correct answer is **D: Konfimasyon ke pifò dinozò yo te gen plim (Confirmation that most dinosaurs had feathers)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that the theory of feathers in dinosaurs was already widespread *before* detailed fossil details like color and tridimensiona arrangement were available.** The new fossil discoveries *add detail* to the existing theory, but they don't *confirm* the widespread presence of feathers. The passage implies this was already largely accepted.

Let's look at why the other options *are* results of the feather discoveries:

* **A: Koulè plim bèt yo (Color of animal feathers):** The passage states scientists have made suggestions about the colors based on the feather discoveries.
* **B: Konprann ke yo pa t itilize plim yo pou vole (Understanding that they were not used for flight):**  The passage directly says the feather structure suggests they were used for temperature regulation or display, not flight.
* **C: Apèsi sou evolisyon plim yo (Insight into the evolution of feathers):** The passage discusses the development of the rachis (feathers' shaft) in relation to other feather characteristics, suggesting evolutionary steps.



"
Kisa plim dinozò yo pa t genyen?,"The correct answer is **B: Yon rachi**. 

The passage explicitly states: ""Kòm plim dinozò yo pa gen yon tij byen devlope, ki rele rachi..."" which translates to ""Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis...""
"
Kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki konsène ZMapp ki pa verite?,"The incorrect statement about ZMapp is **B: Li ka trete enfeksyon ki egziste yo, men li pa ka anpeche lanmò.**

Here's why: The passage states that ZMapp *initially* showed promise on the ground, but *formal studies* indicated it presented *less benefit* than initially thought in preventing death.  This implies it *could* treat existing infections, but its effectiveness in preventing death was less than hoped for. The question states it *can* treat infection but *cannot* prevent death, which is inaccurate given the text implies it *could* treat but had limited efficacy in preventing death.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Li fèt ak antikò** - The text says ZMapp was a cocktail of antibodies.
*   **C: Li te sèvi kòm kontwòl nan esè PALM nan** - The passage explicitly states ZMapp served as the control in the PALM trial.
*   **D: Etid yo montre ke li gen mwens avantaj ke sa yo te panse l te genyen odepa** - The passage directly states this.



Therefore, the answer is **B**."
Kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki pi byen dekri esè PALM nan?,"The best answer is **B: Yo te konpare yon medikaman kontwòl ak twa lòt tretman, ZMapp enkli ladan yo.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Nan esè PALM nan, ZMapp te sèvi kòm temwen, kidonk syantifik yo itilise li kòm baz done epi konpare twa lòt yo avèl.""  This directly translates to the statement that a control drug was compared to three others, with ZMapp being one of them.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as accurate:

* **A: Etid yo montre ke li ka gen plis avantaj ke sa yo te panse l te genyen anvan:** While the study *might* reveal new advantages, the passage doesn't explicitly state this is the main outcome of the PALM trial.  It highlights the comparison between ZMapp and other treatments.
* **C: Yo te itilize ZMapp kòm referans pou esè a:** ZMapp *was* used as a reference, but the primary purpose of PALM was the *comparison* of ZMapp with other treatments.
* **D: Yo te montre li efikas nan tretman maladi ki egziste yo:** The passage indicates ZMapp's efficacy was less than initially hoped, so the study didn't *prove* it effective.  The focus is on comparing it to potentially more effective treatments.



"
Kikote chèchè yo panse nouvo tchip la t ap pi enpòtan?,"The correct answer is **A: Peyi a fèb revni yo (Developing countries)**.

The text explicitly states that the researchers believe the tool will be most important in developing countries where survival rates for diseases like breast cancer are significantly lower than in wealthier nations.
"
Ki metòd y ap itilize pou elabore zouti dyagnostik la?,"The correct answer is **C: Tchip ki ka enprime** (Printable chip).

The text states the device is ""a tiny chip that can be printed with the help of a regular inkjet printer for around 50 cents per patient.""  The core of the new diagnostic tool is the **printable chip** which contains the diagnostic capability.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki deklarasyon konsènan sikatris lobe yo ki pa yon verite?","The correct answer is **D: Nou pa jwenn anpil sou sifas lalin nan (We don't know much about the surface of the planet).**

Here's why:

* **The passage *does* say we've discovered these scars.** It states, ""Syantifik yo te dekouvri fòm teren nan sifas lalin..."" (Scientists have discovered landforms on the surface of the planet...).  This directly contradicts option D.

Let's break down why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Evènman ki kreye yo a, te pwodui resaman pwobableman (The events that created them were likely produced recently).** The passage states the scars ""sanble pat degrade anpil, sa ki endike evènman jewolojik ki te kreye yo pat twò ansyen"" (seem not to have degraded much, which indicates the geological events that created them were not too old).
* **B: Prezans yo vle di lalin nan pa manke aktivite jewolojik (Their presence means the planet is not lacking geological activity).** The passage directly states this: ""sa kontredi afimasyon selon li lalin nan totalman san aktivite jewolojik"" (this contradicts the assertion that the planet is totally inactive geologically).
* **C: Yo kapab se akoz retresisman lalin nan (They could be due to the planet's contraction).** The passage says the scars are ""sanble pat degrade anpil"" (seem not to have degraded much), suggesting a relatively recent origin, and planetary contraction is a geological process. While not explicitly stated as the *cause*, it's a plausible explanation.



Therefore, only option D is definitively *not* supported by the passage.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki teyori ki konsène relyèf yo ki montre ke gen yon aktivite jewolojik sou lalin?","The correct answer is **D: Sa pa gen lontan depi relyèf yo te kreye.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that scientists discovered ""scarfs lobés"" on the Earth's surface that resemble the Earth's crustal folds.
* These scars are widespread and haven't degraded much, suggesting the geological event that created them wasn't very old.
* This directly contradicts the idea that the Earth is completely inactive geologically. Therefore, the theory presented is that the relief features are relatively young.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lalin nan ap diminye ti pa ti pa:** The passage doesn't mention the Earth's surface shrinking.
* **B: Sa gen lontan depi relyèf yo te kreye:** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.
* **C: Sifas lalin nan montre sèlman yon ti kantite fòm relyèf:** The passage talks about *widespread* scarfs, not just a small amount of features.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki p ap janm genyen ankò jiska ak akizasyon an?","The correct answer is **A: Lòt kòmantè (Other comments)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ministè piblik la, ki chaje tout pouswit yo, te di ak jounalis yo okenn lòt kòmantè pa pral fèt pou pi piti jouk lè enkilpasyon an."" (The Crown Prosecution Service said to journalists that no further comments would be made until after the indictment).
* While the passage discusses the publication of the photo and the potential impact on witness testimony, it doesn't state that publication of the photo will *not* happen again. It only indicates the current situation and the Crown's stance on commenting.
* The passage doesn't say anything about a prohibition on publishing photos or articles.

Therefore, only ""Lòt kòmantè"" (Other comments) is specifically mentioned as being withheld until after the indictment.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki pa yon pwoblèm pou chasè fòk yo?","The correct answer is **D: Glas k ap fonn**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the difficult weather conditions and the amount and thickness of the ice are problems for the rescue efforts and hunting. 
* The passage says the ice conditions are the *worst in 15 years*.  This implies the ice is *not* melting; it's the opposite – it's thick and problematic.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* a problem according to the passage is the ice melting.



"
"Anplis de glas la, ki lòt bagay ki ka afekte operasyon sovtaj yo?","The correct answer is **B: Kondisyon tan yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Anplis glas fele, **kondisyon metewolojik difisil yo te mennen efò sovtaj yo**."" (In addition to the ice, difficult weather conditions hindered rescue efforts.)

While the other options *could* be factors in a rescue operation, the passage *only* mentions weather conditions as a hindering factor. Therefore, option B is the direct answer based on the provided text.
"
Ki kwayans Roberts te refize valide?,"The correct answer is **C: Kòmansman lavi**.

The passage states: ""Roberts te refize klèman di nan ki moman li panse lavi kòmanse..."" This directly indicates that Roberts refused to validate a belief about when life begins.  While he acknowledges the importance of precedent (B) and the foundational role of the belief in Roe v. Wade (D), the specific belief he avoided validating is the point at which life begins. The passage doesn't mention a belief in a right to privacy (D).
"
Ki sijè Roberts te wè ki twò pa kadre ak etik la pou yo te abòde li?,"The correct answer is **D: Patikilarite ka yo (Particular cases)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Roberts found it ""contrary to ethics to comment on the details of probable cases."" This directly refers to the specifics of individual situations, not broader legal principles like the consistency of Supreme Court decisions or the Roe v. Wade decision itself.  He was uncomfortable with getting into the specifics of individual abortion cases.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Koyerans nan desizyon Kou Siprèm yo (Consistency of Supreme Court decisions):** While Roberts mentioned the importance of consistency, he wasn't finding the *consistency* itself ethically problematic. He was hesitant about commenting on specific cases.
*   **B: Desizyon Roe v. Wade la (The Roe v. Wade decision):** Roberts affirmed his belief in the fundamental right to life *as the basis* of Roe v. Wade. He didn't find Roe v. Wade itself ethically problematic.
*   **C: Dwa a vi prive enplisit la (The implied right to privacy):** While the right to privacy is linked to Roe v. Wade, the passage doesn't say Roberts found that right ethically problematic.



"
Ki kote de feso limyè yo ap klere?,"The correct answer is **A: Anlè nan syèl la** (In the sky).

The text says: ""De feso limyè te monte pou pwente nan direksyon syèl la pandan nwit lan."" This translates to ""Two beams of light rose to point towards the direction of the sky during the night.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè y ap konstwi nouvo gratsyèl sou sit la?","The correct answer is **C: Lannwit** 

The passage states: ""A 8è46 nan maren egzakteman, yon silans anpare vil la...Kontriksyon senk nouvo grat syèl ap fèt nan moman an sou sit la..."" which translates to ""At exactly 8:46 a.m., a silence fell over the city...Construction of five new skyscrapers is taking place at that moment on the site..."" 

While it mentions 8:46 a.m., the sentence indicates that the construction is happening *at that time*, which is during the morning, and the subsequent phrase ""nan moman an sou sit la"" (at that moment on the site) doesn't specify daytime. Considering ""yon silans anpare vil la"" (a silence fell over the city), it strongly implies that it's nighttime. Therefore, the construction is happening at night.



"
Ki enfòmasyon ki te sijere pou Sèt Sè yo se gwòt?,"The correct answer is **A: Chanjman tanperati yo (Temperature variations)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Imaj enfra wouj yo montre ke varyasyon tanperati lannwit ak lajounen yo ta sanble gwòt. Yo pi frèt pase sifas alantou l lan lè l jou epi cho lè l lannwit."" This directly links temperature variations to the cave's nature.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dyamèt antre gwòt yo (Diameter of the cave entrance):** While the diameter is mentioned, it's not the primary indicator *suggesting* it's a cave. It's a characteristic of the cave.
* **C: Etid jewolojik (Geological studies):** The passage doesn't mention any geological studies.
* **D: Foto gwòt ki sou tè a (Photos of caves on Earth):**  The passage mentions infrared images, but not photos of Earth caves as a basis for the conclusion.



"
Kòman yo te obsève konpòtman tèmik sèt sè yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Imaj enfrawouj (Infrared images)**.

The passage states: ""Imaj enfra wouj yo montre ke varyasyon tanperati lannwit ak lajounen yo ta sanble gwòt."" (Infrared images show that the temperature variations between day and night resemble the caves.) This directly indicates that infrared images were used to observe the thermal behavior of the caves.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki deklarasyon konsènan sispè la ki pa yon verite?","The correct answer is **D: Li pa t blese (He was not injured)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Lòm ki te sispèk li ki te fè eksploze bonm lan te arete aprè l te **blese pa eksplozyon an**."" (The man suspected of having detonated the bomb was arrested after **being injured by the explosion**.)

Let's look at why the other options are true:

* **A: Li te itilize yon machin pandan atak la (He used a vehicle during the attack)** - The passage states ""Lòm ta kondi yon machin ak twa kawoutchou zam eksplozif nan yon foul."" (The man was driving a vehicle with three explosive rubber bands in a crowd.)
* **B: Li te eksploze yon bonb (He detonated a bomb)** - The passage states ""Lòm ki te sispèk li ki te fè eksploze bonm lan..."" (The man suspected of having detonated the bomb...)
* **C: Otorite yo konn orijin etnik li (Authorities know his ethnic origin)** - The passage states ""...menm ke yo konnen li se yon manb nan group ras Igi yo."" (...even though it is known that he is a member of the Igi race group.)



"
Ki enfòmasyon konsènan atak la otorite yo te konfime?,"The correct answer is **B: Orijin etnik sispèk la**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that authorities know the suspect is a member of the Igi race group.
*   The text mentions the suspect was arrested after being injured in the explosion and that they don't know his name.
*   The text does not reveal the suspect's identity, motive, or the identity of accomplices.

Therefore, the only information authorities have confirmed from the given text is the suspect's ethnic origin."
Ki ekip k ap jwe match nan Ellis Park la?,"The correct answer is **C: Afrik Disid ak Ostrali**.

The text states: ""Dènye match seri a pral fèt nan Ellis Park nan Johannesburg semèn pwochèn, lè Springboks pral afwonte Ostrali.""  Springboks is the name for the South African national rugby team.
"
Ki kote Springboks yo ap jwe pwochen match yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Dènye match seri a pral fèt nan Ellis Park nan **Johannesburg** lè Springboks pral afwonte Ostrali."" (The last match of the series will be held at Ellis Park in **Johannesburg** when the Springboks face Australia.)
"
"Pami sa yo, kiyès ki bay estasyon espasyal la pwoblèm pandan misyon an?","The correct answer is **B: Konsève yon jiwoskòp (Conserving a gyroscop)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the station ""held its attitude despite the loss of a gyroscop *before* the end of the space mission.""  This loss of a gyroscopic stabilizer is directly linked to the problem the station faced.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kenbe yon bon distans ak pwopilsè yo (Maintaining a safe distance from the thrusters):** The text explicitly says Chiao and Sharipov were maintaining a safe distance *from the thrusters* (motè). This was a solution, not the initial problem.
*   **C: Aktivasyon djèt (Activating thrusters):** Activating thrusters was *part of the solution* to regain the station's attitude, not the problem itself.
*   **D: Repran yon atitid nòmal (Restoring normal attitude):** This is the *result* of the actions taken, not the problem.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, nan ki bi yo te reyalize misyon nan estasyon espasyal la?","The correct answer is **C: Fini yon soti nan lespas**.

The passage states the station ""held its attitude until the end of the departure from space."" This indicates the primary goal was a successful departure. The other options are actions taken *during* the departure, not the overall mission objective.
"
Kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki konsène dosye a ki pa verite?,"The answer is **D: Yo te chaje AOL**.

Here's why:

* **The text states that AOL *was* accused of sending spam and is being pursued in Virginia.** It doesn't say AOL was *charged*. 
* **AOL *did* receive a condemnation (punishment/judgment).** The text explicitly says, ""Se premye fwa yo pwononse yon kondanasyon..."" (It's the first time they've been given a condemnation...).
* **AOL *did* use the law passed in 2003 regarding spam.** The text mentions that the condemnation is due to the application of the 2003 law.
* **The pursuit occurred in Virginia, where AOL's headquarters are located.** This is directly stated in the first sentence.

Therefore, the only statement that is not supported by the provided text is that AOL was charged.



"
Kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki pi byen dekri dosye a?,"The best answer is **A: Yo te akize AOL de distribisyon non otorize**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Yo te pouswiv AOL nan Vijini paske se kay dirijan founisè sèvis entènèt AOL, konpayi ki te enstige akizasyon yo."" This means AOL was accused of something.
* The passage further explains that the accusation relates to the distribution of spam, which is ""distribisyon endezirab."" Therefore, AOL was accused of unauthorized distribution.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Dosye a te konsène de gran founisè aksè a entènèt:** While AOL is a major ISP, the passage focuses on the *accusation* against AOL, not a general discussion of ISPs.
* **C: Dosye a te kontinye an 2003:** The passage mentions the law was adopted in 2003, but it doesn't say the case *continued* in 2003. It describes the first condemnation under the law.
* **D: AOL te angaje pouswit nan dosye a:** The passage states that AOL was *subjected to* the pursuit (pouswit) by the authorities, not that AOL initiated the pursuit.

Therefore, option A most accurately reflects the core issue of the case as described in the text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, pou ki klèb Vidal te kòmanse jwe sa gen twa lane de sa?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The passage states: ""Vidal ki genyen 28 lane te sòti Seviy pou al jwenn Basa depi twa sezon."" This translates to ""Vidal, who is 28 years old, left Sevilla to join Barça for three seasons."" Therefore, he started playing for Sevilla three years before moving to Barça.
"
Konbyen match Vidal te jwe pou Barça?,"The correct answer is **B: 39**.

The passage states: ""Depi arive l nan kapital katalàn nan, Vidal te jwe 49 match pou klèb la."" However, the options provided do not include 49. There seems to be a discrepancy between the text and the answer choices.

**However, if we assume the text is correct and there is a typo in the options, then 49 is the correct answer.**

Let's re-evaluate. The question asks ""Konbyen match Vidal te jwe pou Barça?"" (How many matches did Vidal play for Barça?). The text clearly states he played 49 matches.

Since 49 isn't an option, and assuming a typo, let's consider which option is closest and plausible. It's possible there's an error in the provided options, or maybe the text has a slight inaccuracy.

Given the choices, and the fact that the passage *explicitly* says 49, we have to select the closest plausible answer.  Without further context or correction of the options, it's impossible to definitively choose the *correct* answer from the provided choices.

**However, based on the explicit statement in the question text, the best answer is 49, which isn't available.**

Since I must choose from the given options, and assuming a typo exists, none of them are correct. However, if forced to choose the closest one, I would choose:

**B: 39**

This is because it's the only number relatively close to the stated 49.  But again, this is based on the assumption of a typo.



"
A ki ekip li te jwe match la?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text explicitly states: ""Li te rete nan otèl ekip la avan yon match ki te dwe jwe nan dimanch kont ekip Bolonya."" (He stayed at the team hotel before a match that was to be played on Sunday against the Bolonia team.)
"
Poukisa Jarque te rete nan otèl la?,"The correct answer is **C: Li te gen yon match nan dimanch**.

The text states: ""Li te rete nan otèl ekip la avan yon match ki te dwe jwe nan dimanch kont ekip Bolonya."" (He stayed at the team hotel before a match that was scheduled to be played on Sunday against Bologna.)

While he did train, and it was likely an pre-season encounter, the primary reason he stayed at the hotel was for the upcoming match.
"
Poukisa ajans jewofizik Jakata a pa t bay avètisman?,"The correct answer is **D: Li pa t reponn a kritè mayitid tranbleman te yo** (They did not meet the magnitude criteria of the earthquake).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Malgre pat gen menas sounami, abitan yo te kòmanse panike epi kite antrepriz yo ak kay yo. Okenn alèt tsunami pral bay paske tranbleman tè a pat atenn mayitid 6.5 ki egzije."" (Despite there being no tsunami threat, residents began to panic and leave businesses and homes. No tsunami alert will be issued because the earthquake did not reach the required magnitude of 6.5.)
* This directly indicates the decision *not* to issue an alert was based on the earthquake's magnitude being below the threshold.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pa t gen menas sounami** - While true, this is a consequence of the magnitude and not the *reason* for the lack of alert.
* **B: Pou evite panike rezidan yo** -  The passage says people were panicking *despite* the lack of an alert, showing the alert itself wasn't preventing panic.
* **C: Pou evite afekte antrepriz lokal yo** - There is no mention of protecting businesses in the passage.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa tranbleman te a te lakoz?","The correct answer is **D: 6.5 sou echèl mayitid la**.

The passage states: ""okenn alèt tsunami pral bay paske tranbleman tè a pat atenn mayitid 6.5 ki egzije."" This means the earthquake *did not* reach a magnitude of 6.5.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moun yo panike (People panicked)** - This is a consequence of the situation, not the cause of the earthquake.
* **B: Menas sounami (Tsunami threat)** - The passage says there's no tsunami threat, so this is incorrect.
* **C: Avètisman emèt (Warning issued)** -  No warning was issued because the earthquake wasn't strong enough.



"
Kiyès nan sa yo ki motive aktivite solèy la ak tout lòt etwal yo?,"The correct answer is **D: Liminozite, nonm Rossby ak wotasyon**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Aktivite tout zetwal sistèm lan detèmine pa limyozite yo, wotasyon yo epi anyen ankò."" (The activity of all star systems is determined by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.)
* **The text further explains:** ""Limyozite ak wotasyon itilize ansanm pou detèmine kantite Rossby..."" (Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number...)
* **The question asks:** ""Kiyès nan sa yo ki motive aktivite solèy la ak tout lòt etwal yo?"" (What motivates the activity of the sun and all other stars?)

Therefore, luminosity, rotation, and the Rossby number are all explicitly mentioned as factors determining stellar activity.  Options A, B, and C are incomplete."
Kijan yo ka fè konnen nonm Rossby yon etwal?,"The correct answer is **A: Liminozite ak wotasyon**.

The text explicitly states: ""Limyozite ak wotasyon itilize ansanm pou detèmine kantite Rossby yon etwal..."" which translates to ""Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number...""
"
Ki pousantaj moun yo entèwoje ki aksepte pou Ostrali vin yon repiblik san pèdi tan?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 pousan**.

The text states: ""In the two polls, 29% of those questioned thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible...""
"
"Dapre Julie Gillard, kilè Ostrali ta dwe devni yon repiblik?","The correct answer is **B: Aprè rèy Elizabèt II**.

The text states: ""Premye Minis pwovizwa Julia Gillard te deklare pandan kanpay eleksyon federal 2010 yo li te panse Ostrali te dwe in yon repiblik nan fen rèy rèn Elizabèt II a.""
"
Ki òganizasyon ki gen ankèt jidisyè k ap fèt sou li?,"The correct answer is **C: Planifikasyon familyal**.

The question asks which organization is under judicial investigation. The text states that ""Politik Komen diskalifye Planed parintoud akoz de yon anket sou fason ke yap depanse..."" which translates to ""Common Policy disqualified Planed because of an investigation into how they spent..."" This clearly indicates that Planifikasyon familyal (Family Planning) is the organization being investigated.
"
Nan tèt ki komisyon Cliff Stearns ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Komisyon Enèji ak Komès Chanm nan**.

The text states: ""Mesye Stèn chèche konnen si enpo sèvi pou finanse avvtman pandan li pase nan planifikasyon familyal. **Nan kalite prezidan sou komisyon siveyans ak ankèt ki relve dekomisyon enèji ak komès chanm reprezantan yo**...""  This directly indicates that Cliff Stearns is the president of the House Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki pa t rive sitwayèn Swis la?","The correct answer is **A: Yo jwenn byen li yo te vòlè yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that authorities *recovered* the phones and computers of the arrested individuals. This implies that the citizens of Switzerland *did not* recover their stolen belongings. The phrase ""rekipere telefòn pòtab li ak òdinatè l la"" means ""recovered his mobile phone and his computer."" The question asks what *didn't* happen to the Swiss citizen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yo te touye l** - The passage doesn't mention the death of the Swiss citizen.
* **C: 5 moun te vyole li** - The passage states that 5 people *violated* Swiss law, but it doesn't say they violated the Swiss citizen.
* **D: Yo te vòlè telefòn li ak laptòp li** - While the authorities recovered the phones and computers, the passage *doesn't* say the Swiss citizen had them stolen in the first place. It's implying the arrested individuals stole them from *someone*, but not necessarily the Swiss citizen directly. However, option A is a more direct and accurate reflection of what the passage *doesn't* say.
"
Ki konpayi ki te pran Pri Devlopman Dirab Taywann nan an 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states: ""tounen yon sijè aktyalite an 2007 Taipei Mwa Enfòmatik. Men mache konsomasyon òdinatè pòtab la ta  pral varye net epi chanje aprè ASUS te rekonpanse ak pri Taiwan Sustainable Award 2007 se ekzekitif Yuan Repiblik Chin ki te bay li."" This translates to ""became a topic of news in the 2007 Taipei Computer Month. But the consumer portable computer market would vary and change after ASUS was awarded the Taiwan Sustainable Award 2007 given by the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China.""
"
Kisa ASUS Eee PC ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Yon laptòp**.

The text states that the ASUS Eee PC was launched for reasons of cost reduction and functionality, and it became a current topic at the 2007 Taipei Computer Month. The text also refers to it as a ""consumer portable computer,"" which clearly indicates it's a laptop.
"
Kiyès ki te responsab dokiman postal ki manke yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Yon tigason** (A young boy).

The text explicitly states that ""ti gason an te kache plis pase 600 dokiman postal..."" which translates to ""a young boy had hidden more than 600 postal documents..."" This makes him responsible for the missing cards.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès ki te prezante eskiz pou dokiman ki manke yo?","The correct answer is **D: Biwo postal Obanazawa a**.

The passage states: ""Pòs la te prezante eskiz li ak sitwayen yo..."". ""Pòs la"" refers to the Obanazawa post office.
"
Kilè Del Potro te oblije pran swen pwoblèm zepòl li a?,"The correct answer is **C: Pandan dezyèm sèt la**.

The text states: ""Del Potro te resevwa yon tretman nan zepòl nan moman sa la, men li te reyisi reprann jwèt la.""  This ""momant sa a"" refers to the moment the match reached 6-6 in the second set, necessitating a tiebreak.
"
Kisa rezilta premye egalite a te ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Del Potro te genyen nan dezyèm sèt la**.

Here's why:

The question states that after a tie at 6-6, a tiebreak was needed. Del Potro started the second set with an advantage, implying he won that set. The text also mentions Del Potro receiving shoulder treatment but continuing to play, reinforcing that he was able to win the second set.
"
"Jan yo mansyone nan pasaj la, kiyès espesyalman ki te ekspoze a yon pasyan?","The correct answer is **B: Timoun**.

The passage states: ""Jodi a, nou te aprann kèk timoun ki nan laj pou ale lekòl te idantifye kòm gen kontak avèk pasyan an."" (Today, we learned that some children of school age have been identified as having contact with the patient.)



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki asirans gouvènè a pa t bay lè li t ap adrese li a sitwayen Tekzas yo?","The correct answer is **A: Sistèm nan ap byen mache**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Governor Perry declared they were taking ""divès mezi pou pwoteje sekirite piblik la"" (various measures to protect public safety) and that Texas was ""pi byen ekipe pou leve defi ki poze nan ka sa"" (better equipped to meet the challenge).  This indicates action is being taken.
* The governor explicitly said, ""Se yon bagay serye. Bay garanti ke sistem ou a fonksyone pi byen ke jan li dwe fonksyone a."" (This is serious. Providing assurance that your system is functioning better than it should). This implies the system *might not* be functioning optimally, and the governor is asking for reassurance it will improve.
* Option B is directly stated in the passage.
* Option C is directly stated in the passage.
* Option D is the opposite of what the passage suggests; the governor emphasizes the seriousness of the situation.



Therefore, the passage doesn't explicitly assure citizens that the system is already functioning properly.



"
Ki sous enfomasyon pou blag de ansyen elèv UW yo te kreye?,"The correct answer is **D: Zonyon**.

The text explicitly states: ""Depi kreyasyon l, Zonyon te vin yon veritab anpi pawodi aktyalite..."" This means The Onion is the source of the information used for their satirical news.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan sa yo ki pa fè pati kategori jounal blag Zonyon an?","The correct answer is **B: Yon fim (A movie)**.

The passage explicitly lists the following as part of The Onion's offerings:

*   An enprime (a print edition)
*   Yon sit wèb (a website)
*   Anons pèsonèl (personal ads)
*   Yon rezo enfòmasyon 24 èdtan (a 24-hour information network)
*   Podkast yo (podcasts)
*   Yon atlas mondyal (a world atlas)

A movie is not mentioned.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa lapolis t ap siveye?","The correct answer is **C: Antre Downing Street la**.

The passage states: ""Manifestasyon an te kòmanse ozanviwon 11:00 lè lokal (UTC+1) sou Whitehall la, anfas antre ki gade pa lapolis Downing Street...""

This directly indicates that the police were monitoring the entrance to Downing Street.
"
A kilè lapolis te mande manifestan yo pou deplase pou evite agrave sikilasyon an?,"The correct answer is **D: A 11:20**.

The text states: ""11è20, lapolis mande manifestan yo pou retounen sou twotwa..."" which translates to ""11:20, the police asked the protesters to return to the pavement..."" This was done to mitigate the traffic disruption.
"
Kisa ki vrè osijè rechèch Doktè Ehud Ur te fè a?,"The correct answer is **B: Kèk sourit dyabetik anvan sa pa fè dyabèt ankò** (Some diabetic mice didn't develop diabetes again).

Here's why:

* The passage states that Dr. Ur is ""hesitant about the subject that diabetes can be cured.""  He explicitly says the research is ""still in its early stages"" and that the results ""have no relevance to people suffering from type 1 diabetes.""
* The core point he's making is that the *mice* who initially had diabetes didn't get it back.  This is the key implication of the research, even though Dr. Ur is cautious about drawing broad conclusions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rezilta a ka bon pou pasyan ki soufri ak dyabèt Tip 1 ki egziste deja** (The results may be good for patients suffering from existing type 1 diabetes):  Dr. Ur says the results *don't* apply to Type 1 diabetes.
* **C: Li optimis sou posibilite ki genyen pou jwenn remèd pou maladi sa a** (He is optimistic about the possibility of finding a cure for this disease): Dr. Ur is *hesitant*, not optimistic.
* **D: Kèk sourit ki pa t dyabetik vin fè dyabèt kounye a** (Some non-diabetic mice have developed diabetes now): The passage doesn't mention anything about non-diabetic mice developing diabetes.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, sou ki pwen Doktè Ur te ensèten?","The correct answer is **B: Si gen yon tretman ki posib**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Comme plusieurs autres savants, il est incertain sur le sujet que la maladie du diabète puisse être guérie..."" This translates to: ""Like many other scientists, he is uncertain about the subject of whether diabetes can be cured...""

Option B, ""Si gen yon tretman ki posib"" (Whether a possible treatment exists), directly reflects this uncertainty. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki pa dekri kòrèkteman aksidan vòl CG4684 la?,"The incorrect statement is **C: Avyon an te eseye ateri twa fwa anvan li kraze.**

The text states the plane was on its *second* approach when it disappeared. It doesn't mention any previous failed landing attempts. The other statements are supported by the text.
"
Kisa k te lakoz entèripsyon nan aterisaj vòl CG4684 la?,"The correct answer is **D: Kondisyon meteowolojik yo pa t bon** (The weather conditions were not good).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Rechèch yo te ralanti pa menm move tan tankou sa ki te pwovoke aterisaj rate a."" (The search was slowed down by the same bad weather that caused the failed landing.)
* While option A mentions inaccessibility, the text implies the inaccessibility is *because* of the weather and the terrain, not the sole cause of the interruption.
* Options B and C are not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the bad weather is the direct cause of the interruption, as it was a factor in the initial failed landing and is slowing down the search efforts.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, pami deklarasyon sa yo konsènan eksperyans Franciszek Kowal la, kiyès ki verite?","The correct answer is **A: Li te rive kraze yon fenèt (He witnessed a window being broken)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Youn nan vit yo te finalman kraze..."" (One of the windows finally broke...). Franciszek Kowal *witnessed* this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Finalman li soti sennesòf (He finally escaped through the window):** The passage states he *witnessed* someone escaping through the window, but it doesn't say *he* escaped.
* **C: Li te kraze yon chèz pandan l ap eseye soti (He broke a chair while trying to escape):** The passage mentions people hitting things with chairs, but it doesn't say Franciszek Kowal broke a chair.
* **D: Li te blese pandan l ap eseye kraze yon fenèt (He was injured while trying to break a window):** The passage doesn't mention any injuries.

Therefore, the only statement directly supported by the passage is that he witnessed a window being broken.
"
Poukisa li difisil pou evalye posib enpak tanpèt twopikal Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Tanpèt la lwen pou li touche tè.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kòm tanpèt lwen pou li touche tè a, li difisil pou evalye enpak potansyèl sou Etazini oubyen Karayib la."" (Because the storm is far from making landfall, it is difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo prevwa tanpèt la ap ranfòse pou vin siklòn:** While the passage mentions the forecast for intensification, this isn't the *primary* reason it's difficult to assess impact.
* **B: Syantifik yo pa sèten de van tanpèt la ap pote yo:** The passage doesn't state uncertainty about wind speeds.
* **D: Yo lokalize tanpèt la twò lwen Miami:**  The location relative to Miami isn't the core reason for the difficulty in assessment; it's the *distance from land* that's the problem.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ke yo fè sou tanpèt twopikal Danielle la ki pa verite?","The incorrect statement is **D: Li pare pou touche tè (It is preparing to make landfall)**.

Here's why: The passage explicitly states, ""Kòm tanpèt lwen pou li touche tè a, li difisil pou evalye enpak potansyèl sou Etazini oubyen Karayib la"" which translates to ""As the storm is far from making landfall, it is difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.""

The passage indicates Danielle is *not* preparing to make landfall; it's still too far away to predict its impact. The other statements are true according to the passage.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa k ta dwe pase a maladi a anvan li pwovoke yon epidemi nan mond lan?","The correct answer is **A: Li ta dwe vin mwen mòtèl**

The passage explicitly states: ""Kèk etid yo sijere maladi a dwe vin mòtèl avan li pa kapab pwovoke yon epidemi mondyal..."" which translates to ""Some studies suggest the disease must become deadly before it can trigger a global epidemic...""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, a ki ditans tifon an ye de Fujian?","The correct answer is **C: 70 kilomèt**.

The passage states: ""Nan nwit 9 out la, je Morakot te twouvel a swasant tyaphon kilomèt pwovens chinwaz Fujian."" This translates to: ""On the night of August 9th, Typhoon Morakot was located sixty kilometers from the Fujian province of China.""
"
Kiyès ki te akeyi George W. Bush lè l te rive an Azi a?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng ak Lee Hsien Loong**.

The passage states: ""Te vis Premye Minis Sengapou a Wong Kan Seng, ki te resevwa li epi yo te pale sou koze komes ak pwoblem teworis avek Premye Minis Sengapou a Lee Hsien Loong.""  This means both Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong greeted George W. Bush."
Kilè prezidan an te pale sou devlopman komèsyal ak Azi a?,"The correct answer is **C: Apre li te pèdi eleksyon mi manda a**.

The text states: ""Apre li fin fè yon semèn ap pèdi nan yon eleksyon mi-manda a, Bouch pale odyans la sou ekspansyon komès la nan Lazi."" This directly indicates that he spoke about expanding trade in Asia *after* losing the midterm election.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan objektif annapre yo ki se objektif jeneral gouvènman an?","The correct answer is **D: Diminye ankonbreman wagon yo (Relieve overpopulation of wagons)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the government is extending its commitment to finance *more* wagons ""to relieve overpopulation."" This directly indicates the government's *goal* is to reduce the problem of too many wagons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Finanse lòt wagon pou rive mwa mas ane sa a (Financing more wagons by the end of this March):** This is a *means* to an end, not the end itself. Financing wagons is a step *towards* relieving overpopulation.
* **B: Achte 300 wagon an total (Buying a total of 300 wagons):** The passage mentions adding 300, but the target is a much larger number (1300).  This is a specific number, not the overall goal.
* **C: Achte 1,300 lòt wagon (Buying 1,300 more wagons):** Similar to B, this is a specific quantity, but not the main objective.



"
Kisa gouvènman an te anonse?,"The correct answer is **A: Yo prevwa finanse 300 wagon anplis**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""300 se sa yo dwe mete anplis pou finanse machin yo anplis."" This directly translates to ""300 is what they must put in to finance the additional vehicles.""
* Option A accurately reflects this statement.
* Options B, C, and D are either too broad or incorrect based on the passage's specific information. The passage focuses on financing 300 additional vehicles, not general transport solutions or the total number of wagons.

"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki enfòmasyon moun yo genyen?","The correct answer is **A: Nivo menas la te diminye**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Pa gen okenn ransèyman ki sijere yon atak ap rive yon fason imedya."" (There is no intelligence suggesting an attack is imminent.)
* It also says, ""Toutfwa, rediksyon nivo menas grav pa siyifi menas global te disparèt."" (However, a reduction in the level of serious threat does not mean the global threat has disappeared.)

This means the threat level has decreased, but a global threat still exists.  Option A accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pa gen okenn menas ankò** (There is no threat anymore): The passage explicitly states the opposite - a global threat hasn't disappeared.
* **C: Yo espere yon atak** (They expect an attack): The passage says there's no indication of an imminent attack.
* **D: Sèvis entelijans yo konfime ke atak la ap brital** (Intelligence services have confirmed the attack will be brutal): The passage doesn't mention the nature or brutality of a potential attack, only the level of the threat.



"
Ki deklarasyon konsènan manifestasyon yo ki pa yon verite?,"The correct answer is **C: Manifestasyon yo egzije demisyon asyen CEP a.**

Here's why:

* **The text states the presidential commission was recommended *because of* the protests, not *to fulfill the demands of* the protests.** The protests were a reaction to the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) and the election results, but the commission's purpose was to address the crisis *caused* by the CEP.
* **A:** This is true. The presidential commission was a response to the protests.
* **B:** This is true. The absence of elections, like in 2011, triggered the protests.
* **D:** This is true. The protests were sometimes violent.

Therefore, the statement that the protests demanded the resignation of the former CEP is the incorrect one according to the provided text."
Kiyès ki te sijere pou dènye CEP a demisyone?,"The correct answer is **C: Komisyon prezidansyèl la**.

The text states: ""Mwa pase a yon komisyon prezidansyèl rekòmande demisyon KEP kom mezi pou fe avanse peyi an pou nouvel eleksyon yo."" (Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as a measure to advance the country towards new elections.)
"
"Dapre deklarasyon an, kisa USA Gymnastics pa t sipòte aprè abi Nassar te fè atlèt yo?","The correct answer is **C: Chanjman nesesè nan òganizasyon an**.

Here's why:

The statement says USA Gymnastics **agrees** with the USOC that significant changes *within* their organization are needed, but they prefer **decertification** (retiring the sanction) instead. This implies they don't fully support the changes happening within the organization *as the primary solution*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Retire sètifika a:** The statement explicitly says they are *for* decertification, which is essentially retirement of the sanction.
*   **B: Kreye yon anviwònman ki favorize otonomi:** They state that they agree with the USOC's goal of a safe, supportive, and *autonomous* environment.
*   **D: Yon ankèt endepandan:** The statement says they *support* an independent investigation.

Therefore, the answer is C.



"
"Dapre deklarasyon an, ki objektif prensipal USA Gymnastics ak Komite Olenmpik Ameriken an pou pwochen ane yo?","The correct answer is **D: Ankouraje kreyasyon yon anviwònman fyab pou atlèt yo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""USA Gymnastics ak USOC a gen menm objektif — rann espò jimnastik lan, ak lòt yo, pi sekiritè posib pou atlèt yo kapab pouswiv rèv yo nan yon anviwònman sekiritè, pozifif ak otonòm.""  This directly reflects the goal of creating a safer environment for athletes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Limyè sou abi Larry Nassar yo:** While the passage supports an independent investigation to shed light on Nassar's abuse, it's not presented as the *primary* objective for the coming years. It's a step *towards* a safer environment.
*   **B: Kontinye pwosesis retire sètifika a:**  The passage mentions the decertification process, but it's framed as a means to achieve a safer environment, not the ultimate goal itself.
*   **C: Pouswiv yon ankèt prive:** The passage supports an *independent* investigation, not a private one."
Ki kote bato a ta prale lè ensidan an te rive a? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The passage states: ""Yon bato Avenger ki chaje pou lite kont min yo, bato an ta prale Pwèto Prensesa nan Palawan."" This directly answers the question of where the ship was headed.
"
Kiyès nan fè sa yo sou bato yo mansyone nan pasaj la ki pa yon verite?,"The correct answer is **B: Li baze Palawan**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Yon bato Avenger ki chaje pou lite kont min yo, bato an ta prale Pwèto Prensesa nan Palawan."" This means the ship was *going to* Puerto Princesa, not based there. 
* The passage *does* say the ship is based in Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan.
* The passage *does* say the ship is equipped to fight mines.
* The passage *does* say the ship is part of the 7th US Fleet.

Therefore, the statement that the ship is based in Palawan is not true based on the given text."
Kiyès ki te fè deklarasyon konsènan twoup Ameriken yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**. 

The question states: ""Dimanch apremidi, Prezidan Etazini an Donald Trump, nan yon deklarasyon ki te fèt atravè sekretè pou la près..."" which directly identifies Donald Trump as the one who made the announcement.
"
"Dapre deklarasyon an, ki peyi ki te pran responsabilite gad konbatan yo arete yo?","The correct answer is **D: Latiki**. 

The passage states: ""Tiki te pran tou an chaj siveyans konbatan ISIS prizonye yo kote nasyon ewopeyèn yo te refize rapatriye yo..."" which translates to ""Turkey took on the responsibility of monitoring ISIS fighters prisoners where European nations refused to repatriate them...""
"
Kisa yo sipoze ki te lakoz aksidan an?,"The correct answer is **C: Tè mòn**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Aksidan an te rive wo nan tèren mòn..."" (The accident happened in mountainous terrain...).  This directly points to the terrain as a factor.  While bad weather and difficult terrain hindered the search, the *cause* of the accident is implied to be related to the mountainous location. The text also mentions ""gwo dife"" (large fire), which may have contributed, but the initial location is the key factor.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Teren difisil (Difficult terrain):** While difficult terrain hampered the search, it's not stated as the *cause* of the accident.
*   **B: Kout bal ènmi an (Enemy bullet):** There's no mention of enemy fire in the text.
*   **D: Move tan (Bad weather):** Bad weather hampered the search, but it's not stated as the cause of the accident.



"
Sou ki tip de teren aksidan an fèt?,"The correct answer is **D: Mòn**. 

The passage explicitly states: ""Accident happened high in mountainous terrain..."" (Aksidan an te rive wo nan tèren mòn).
"
Kisa otorite yo te espere apre inondasyon an?,"The correct answer is **A: Restorasyon ban sab yo** (Restoration of the sandbanks).

The text states: ""Memsi nivo dlo a monte kèk pye aprè inondasyon an, otorite yo espere ke li ap ase pou **restore ban sab ki efrite yo pa anba**."" (Even though the water level rose a few feet after the flood, the authorities hope it will be enough to **restore the sandbanks that have been eroded underneath**.)
"
"Pami eleman sa yo, kiyès konstriksyon baraj la te afekte de fason pèmanan?","The correct answer is **B: Pwason (Gila cypha)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Kòm konsekans de espès pwason disparèt..."". This directly links the construction of the dam to the permanent disappearance of the Gila cypha fish species.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ban sab yo:** The text mentions that the sediment flow *stopped* due to the dam, which *harmed* the sandbanks. While the damage is significant, the text doesn't say the sandbanks are affected *permanently*. It hopes to restore them.
* **C: Abita pou fo n la:** The text says the dam led to the disappearance of fish, and the lack of fish *may* affect the habitat of the fo tuna. But it doesn't state the habitat is *permanently* affected.
* **D: Pwopagasyon sediman yo:** The text clearly states that the dam *stopped* the sediment propagation. This is a direct and permanent effect. However, the question asks which was affected *permanently* by the *construction* of the dam, and the disappearance of a species is a more direct and established consequence.

Therefore, the permanent loss of the Gila cypha fish population is the most direct and clearly stated consequence of the dam's construction.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès ki te bay Etazini enfòmasyon pou posib atak yo?","The correct answer is **C: Yon sous ki pa revele (A non-identified source)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Etazini di yo resevwa nan men **yon sous ki pa devwale** kèk enfòmasyon..."" (The US said it received some information from **an unidentified source**...)
"
Kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki dekri plan atak ekstremis yo te anonse a ak presizyon?,"The best answer is **C: Eksploze bonb sou pwen repè yo nan de peyi**.

Here's why:

* **The statement explicitly mentions both Kenya and Ethiopia.**
* It states the threat involves suicide bombings and bombs in *both* countries.
* It also mentions using explosives on ""important transit points,"" which implies targets within those countries.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Eksploze bonb sou pwen repè yo nan yon peyi** - While the threat involves targets in multiple countries, this option only specifies one.
* **B: Eksploze bonb nan de peyi** -  This is true, but doesn't specify the *type* of targets. The statement clarifies ""important transit points"" which implies targets.
* **D: Eksploze bonb nan yon peyi** - Similar to A, this doesn't specify the multiple countries mentioned.



"
Kiyès nan moun sa yo ki pa yon avoka?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Petros Mantouvalos is a member of Parliament *and* a lawyer.
*   Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are identified as celebrities and lawyers.
*   The passage mentions Makis Triantafylopoulos as a journalist who published the information.

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only one who is not identified as a lawyer."
Ki gwoup moun yo pa mansyone ki fè pati eskandal ki genyen nan kominote jiridik Grèk la?,"The correct answer is **A: Notè yo**

The text explicitly mentions the following groups involved in the scandal:

*   Avoka yo (Lawyers)
*   Jij yo (Judges)
*   Prokirè (Prosecutors)
*   Jiris yo (Jurists)

Notè (Notaries) are not mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, they are the group not mentioned in the scandal."
Konbyen tikè End te pèdi?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""Lend fè 36 desant kote li pèdi 7 wicket pou fini manch la."" This translates to ""Lend had 36 descents where he lost 7 wickets to finish the innings.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki pi gwo pwen ki te fèt nan pati a?","The correct answer is **C: 100 kous**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid achieved a **century partnership**. A century partnership means they scored a combined total of 100 runs together. While Robin Uthappa's 70 runs are impressive, and the total score is important, the century partnership is highlighted as a significant achievement.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 70 kous** - This is Robin Uthappa's score, not the biggest point in the match.
*   **B: 36 kous** - This is the number of runs Lend scored, not the biggest point in the match.
*   **D: 41 kous** - This is the number of balls Robin Uthappa took to score his runs, not the biggest point in the match.

"
Kiyès nan sa yo ki pa yonn nan koz fristrasyon Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **C: Paske peyi Gal pa koute l (Because Gal didn't cost him)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states Adam Cuerden was frustrated by the *claims* that the elimination was due to cost. He argues they lied about *that* reason.
* The other options are all directly mentioned as sources of his frustration:
    * **B: Eliminasyon peyi Gal (Elimination of Gal):** He's frustrated about the elimination itself.
    * **D: Mansonj sou koz eliminasyon la (Lies about the reason for the elimination):** This is a direct statement of his frustration.
    * **A: Nouvo politik sit la nan sa ki konsène kontni seksyèl (The new site policy regarding sexual content):** The text says the frustration *led to* efforts to create this policy, implying it's a consequence of the previous issues, but not a direct cause of his initial frustration.

Therefore, the statement that ""Peyi Gal pa koute l"" is not a reason for his frustration; it's a rebuttal to a lie he claims they told.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa yo te elimine sou sit la?","The correct answer is **B: Kontni seksyèl**.

The passage states: ""...irritasyon kominote a te kondwui ak efò aktyèl yo ki vize pou elabore yon politik konsènankontni seksyèl pou sit ki ebèje milyon medya sous lisan ki louvri."" This directly indicates that the efforts are focused on creating a policy regarding sexual content.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa Amir Khan pa t sipòte nan tout sa yo?","The correct answer is **A: Entegre fanm konbatan nan Je Olenmpik**

Here's why:

* The passage states Amir Khan said ""in summary, I don't think women should have to fight."" This directly implies he does *not* support the integration of female combatants in the Olympic Games.
* The passage also clarifies that despite his comment, he *will* support British competitors in the 2012 Olympics. This shows his support is specifically for the *competitors*, not the inclusion of women in combat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Konpetitè Anglè yo:** The passage explicitly states he will support British competitors.
* **C: Opinyon fanm:** The passage doesn't say he doesn't support women's opinions, only that he doesn't believe women ""should have to fight.""
* **D: Lond òganize Je Olenmpik:** The passage mentions the Olympics being held in London, but doesn't say he doesn't support London hosting the games.

Therefore, the only thing Amir Khan did *not* support, according to the passage, is integrating female combatants into the Olympic Games.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan sa yo Amir Khan ap sipòte malgre opinyon pèsonèl li?","The correct answer is **C: Je Olenmpik 2012 yo**.

The passage states: ""Malgre kòmantè li yo, lite deklare l ap soutni konkiran britanik yo nan Jwèt olenmpik 2012 yo ki pral fèt nan Lond.""  This means despite his negative opinion on women in sports, he will support the athletes in the 2012 Olympics.
"
Kilè Peter Lenz mouri?,"The correct answer is **C: Nan lopital la**.

The text states: ""Pandan tou echofman li an, Lenz te tonbe sou bekàn li an, epi li te frape pa konpayè l kous li an Xavier Zayat. Pesonel medikal ki te sou plas yo te byen vit ba li swen pou ka pa li a epi yo te voye li nan **yon lot lopital lokal kote li te vin mouri apre**."" (During the warm-up, Lenz fell on his face and was hit by his fellow racer Xavier Zayat. Medical personnel who were on the scene quickly gave him first aid and he was sent to **a local hospital where he later died**.)
"
Kiyès Xavier Zayat ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Yon lòt pilòt (Another racer)**.

The text states: ""Pandan tou echofman li an, Lenz te tonbe sou bekàn li an, epi li te frape pa konpayè l kous li an Xavier Zayat."" This translates to: ""During the warm-up, Lenz fell on his bike and was hit by his fellow racer Xavier Zayat.""
"
Nan ki sitiyasyon yon vwayajè ki enpasyan ap gen enterè pou konprann fonksyònman entèn yon avyon?,"The best answer is **B: Si pè yo gen pou vole a santre sou perèz enkoni.**

Here's why:

* The prompt states that understanding how airplanes work can help alleviate fear related to the unknown or lack of control.
* Option B directly links the fear of flying to fear of the unknown or unfamiliar (""perèz enkoni"").  This aligns perfectly with the prompt's logic.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Si pasaje a pè eksprime perèz li:** While the passenger might be afraid, the prompt isn't about expressing fear, it's about understanding the cause of the fear.
* **C: Si pasaje a sansib a tout tip transpò:**  Being sensitive to all forms of transport doesn't necessarily mean they're specifically afraid of airplanes or their mechanics.
* **D: Si perèz yo a se akoz yon evènman twomatizan ki pa gen rapò ak avyasyon:** A traumatic event unrelated to aviation wouldn't necessarily make someone interested in understanding *how* an airplane works.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan sa yo yon vwayajè ki sansib a pri dwe fè an dènye?","The correct answer is **D: Verifye sit entènèt liy ayeryen an**.

Here's why:

The passage states that it's helpful to ""konsilte sit wèb konpayi ayeryèn lan an avant w fè rezèvasyon an"" (consult the airline's website before making a reservation).  This is because prices can vary between different operators and it's useful to compare the search results and check the airline's website.

While options B and C are generally good practices, the passage specifically highlights checking the airline's website as a crucial step *after* doing some initial research. Option A is less directly supported by the passage.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa vwayajè yo dwe fè an premye pou yo ka jwenn pi bon pri posib pou vòl yo?","The correct answer is **B: Konpare pri ant diferan agregatè (Compare prices across different aggregators)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that it's difficult to find the best price by booking directly with the airline without research. 
* It also highlights the possibility of significant price differences between different operators for the same flight.
* Therefore, comparing prices across different platforms (aggregators) is the recommended first step to finding the best possible price. 
* While checking the airline's website (A) is helpful, it's best *after* comparing prices. Booking directly (C) isn't necessarily the *first* step to find the best price. Booking through a travel agent (D) might not always guarantee the lowest price.



"
Kilè yon konpanyon dwe akonpaye yon livrezon?,"The correct answer is **A: Lè gen ekspedisyon pa frèt ayeryen**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that airline regulations **do not allow** sending a box without a passenger. 
* This restriction is presented as the reason why sending something quickly via air freight (which requires a passenger) is the fastest option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lè konpayi a itilize pwòp avyon pa li:** The passage says *some* large companies have their own planes, but it doesn't say this is *always* the case, nor does it state it circumvents the passenger rule.
* **C: Lè yo voye bagay yo tankou valiz ki anrejistre:** Sending something as registered mail is presented as a workaround *because* it's treated like a package, not because it's specifically linked to passenger requirements.
* **D: Lè gen yon gran konpayi k ap fè livrezon an:** The size of the company doesn't change the airline regulations regarding passenger requirements for air freight.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, lè w ap chwazi yon konpayi ayeryen pou fè yon alyans, kiyès nan sa yo ou dwe konsidere kòm yon priyorite?","The correct answer is **D: Liy ayeryen ki ka ajoute plis privilèj la**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Bạn cần lựa chọn hãng hàng không của mình một cách thận trọng trong chương trình khách hàng thường xuyên của một liên minh. Mặc dù bạn có thể nghĩ rằng việc bay với hãng hàng không của mình thường xuyên hơn sẽ hợp lý, nhưng bạn nên nhận thức được rằng các đặc quyền được cung cấp thường khác nhau và điểm thưởng bạn kiếm được khi bay có thể cao hơn ở một hãng hàng không khác trong cùng một liên minh."" This translates to: ""You need to carefully choose your airline in a frequent flyer program of an alliance. Although you might think it makes sense to fly with your preferred airline more often, you should be aware that the privileges offered are often different and the points you earn when flying may be higher with another airline in the same alliance.""

* The passage emphasizes that privileges vary between airlines within an alliance. 
* While earning more points (A) is important, the passage highlights that privilege differences are more significant.
* The size of the alliance (B) isn't directly mentioned as a priority.
* Flying with the airline you fly most often (C) is a natural inclination but isn't necessarily the best strategy for maximizing benefits within an alliance.

Therefore, prioritizing the airline that offers the *most* privileges is the best approach, according to the passage.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès ki ka ofri plis pwen fidelite?","The correct answer is **A: Yon lòt liy ayeryen ki nan yon lòt alyans**

Here's why: The passage explicitly states: ""you should be aware that the privileges offered can vary and the points earned when you travel may be *more* on *another airline within the same alliance*."" This means a different airline *within the same alliance* could offer more points.  The opposite is true for airlines in *different* alliances.

Therefore, option A is the only one aligning with the provided text."
"Dapre pasaj la, pami tout sans annapre yo kiyès ki ka chanje si w konsome twòp alkòl?","The correct answer is **B: Visyon**.

The passage specifically mentions that excessive bleach consumption can lead to blindness (""menm avèg""). While the passage doesn't directly state that excessive alcohol consumption *causes* blindness, it does mention that alcohol can cause serious dangers, and vision problems are a known consequence of alcohol abuse. The other options (hearing, taste, and smell) are not mentioned in the context of being affected by excessive alcohol consumption in the provided text.
"
"Jan yo mansyone nan pasaj la, kisa ki gen posibilite pou diminye efè nwizib alkòl la?","The correct answer is **C: Konsome alkòl ak moderasyon**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bwason ak alkol yo kapab gen divès ak enpèfeksyon danje, kote metanòl ki pwovoke lanmò a, menm ti bagay yo.""  It then immediately follows with the advice regarding bleaching: ""Bwè kleren avèk moderasyon. Kleren afekte tout moun yon mannyè, epi li enpòtan anpil pou konnen limit sa.""  This implies the need for moderation with alcohol as well, drawing a parallel to the warning about bleaching.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Konsome alkòl ak metanòl:** This is dangerous and directly contradicts the need to minimize harm.
* **B: Bwè bwason ki pwodui ilegalman:** This increases the danger, not decreases it.
* **D: Bwè ak lòt moun:** This has no bearing on the danger of alcohol consumption.



"
Ki kote valè imobilye yo pami valè ki pi elve nan Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Distri Kanal**.

The text explicitly states: ""valè byen li yo pami sa ki pi enpòtant nan peyi a"" (its property values among the most important in the country). This refers directly to the Canal District (Distri Kanal). While the other options might have some validity, the text specifically highlights the Canal District's property values.
"
Poukisa yo te klase Distri Kanal kòm Patrimwàn Mondyal UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: Valè istorik ak kiltirèl li** (Its historical and cultural value).

The text explicitly states that the Canal Ring is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site ""for its unique cultural and historical value."" While the other options might be *related* to the district, they aren't the *reason* it received the UNESCO designation.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, pami eleman sa yo, kisa k fè li enpòtan pou fè yon vizit nan Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **A: Panorama Tonle Sap la**.

The passage states: ""Atmosfè tris tanp lan epi kote pou gade sou lak Tonlé Sap la rann monte ale nan kolin nan entèresan.""  This directly translates to: ""The temple's sad atmosphere and the place to look over Lake Tonlé Sap make the climb to the hill interesting.""

While options D (vwayaj nan bato sou lak la) is mentioned as something that can be combined with a visit, it's not *why* a visit to Phnom Krom itself is important.  The passage highlights the view of Lake Tonlé Sap as a key reason for visiting.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa vizitè yo bezwen pou yo antre Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Jwenn lese pase Angkor (Get an Angkor Pass)**.

The passage states: ""Pas Angkor la nesesè pou antre nan tanp lan kidonk pa bliye pote paspò ou ansanm lè ou pral Tonle Sap."" which translates to ""An Angkor pass is necessary to enter the temple, so don't forget to bring your passport with you when you go to Tonle Sap.""

While the other options are related to the area, the passage explicitly states the need for an Angkor pass to enter Phnom Krom.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa nan tout sa yo ki kapab anpeche yon touris vizite antatik la?","The correct answer is **D: Mobilite fizik limite (Limited physical fitness)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""egzije yon bon kondisyon fizik, kapab sèlman fèt an ete novanm-fevriye epi limite yon an grand pati nan penisil la, nan zile yo ak nan lanmè Ross la."" This directly indicates that a good physical condition is required to visit Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yon bidjè vwayaj enpòtan (An important travel budget):** The passage mentions that tourist visits are ""chè"" (expensive), but it doesn't say that a lack of funds is a barrier.
* **B: Yon sèl enterè pou eksplorasyon lamè Ross (A single interest in exploring the Ross Sea):**  While the Ross Sea is part of the accessible areas, the passage doesn't suggest that *only* having an interest in the Ross Sea prevents a visit.
* **C: Yon orè travay ki pèmèt li vwayaje an desanm ak janvye (A work schedule that allows travel in December and January):** The passage indicates that visits are limited to November-February.  Having a work schedule that doesn't allow travel during that timeframe would be a barrier, but the passage doesn't specifically mention work schedules.



"
Ki pati nan Antatik la yon touris ki renmen alpinis ka vizite?,"The correct answer is **B: Zòn lwen nan peyi a (Remote areas of the continent)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Tanzantan, tou ayeryen espesyalize yo ap rann yo anndan tè yo pou alpinis lan oswa pou atenn Pol la ki posede yon gwo baz."" This directly indicates that alpinists need to go to the remote areas of the continent to access inland locations and reach the South Pole.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Lamè Ross (Ross Sea):** The passage mentions the Ross Sea as a place tourists can visit, but it doesn't specifically relate to alpinism.
* **C: Penensil la (Peninsula):**  The passage says tourism is limited to the peninsula, but it doesn't suggest it's suitable for alpinism.
* **D: Zile yo (Islands):** Similar to the peninsula, the islands are mentioned as tourist destinations, but not specifically for alpinism.



"
Ki kote yon obsèvatwa pre modèn gen mwens posibilite pou l plase?,"The correct answer is **B: Nan sant yon vil**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that pre-modern observatories are *now* often found in museums or educational sites because light pollution in modern times makes urban locations unsuitable. 
*  The passage also mentions modern research telescopes are typically located in remote, favorable locations with good atmospheric conditions.
* Therefore, a location **in the center of a city** would be the least likely place to find a pre-modern observatory today.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yon kote ki fasilman aksesib** - Pre-modern observatories *were* often placed in accessible locations.
* **C: Nan yon zòn ki lwen** - Pre-modern observatories were frequently built in remote locations to minimize light pollution.
* **D: Sou kanpus yon kolèj** - The passage states pre-modern observatories are often found in museums or educational sites and could also exist on a college campus.



"
Ki kote li posib pou enstale yon teleskòp rechèch modèn?,"The correct answer is **B: Sou kanpus yon inivèsite**.

Here's why:

The passage states that modern research telescopes are typically located in remote, favorable regions with good atmospheric conditions. University campuses are often located in areas that meet these criteria, offering more suitable environments than urban areas. While telescopes *can* be found at museums, educational sites, or even potentially on large buildings, the primary location for *research* telescopes is in remote, specialized locations.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki pi bon kote pou pase yon jounen trankil nan plaj?","The correct answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Plaj Tamaki Djwayv yo sou Waitemata arbour a, nan banlye chik nan Mission Bay ak Sen Helyers nan Santral Oklann."" It also says these are ""plaj familyal pafwa ki frekante anpil, avèk yon bon kantite magazen sou tout rivaj la. Benyen san danje.""

While Mission Bay and St Heliers are mentioned as family-friendly and safe for swimming, the passage *doesn't* explicitly say which is *best* for a tranquil day. It only describes them. 

However, **North Harbor** (Option C) is a *region* containing many beaches, not a specific place. **Waitemata Harbor** (Option D) is the body of water the beaches are on, not a location to *spend* a day.

Therefore, while all options are related, St Heliers is one of the locations described, making it a more plausible, though not explicitly stated, answer for a tranquil beach day. The question is a bit tricky because it asks for the *best* place, which isn't directly provided. However, St Heliers fits the description of a family-friendly and safe spot.

**Therefore, the best answer from the options given is A: St Heliers.**
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki kote kondisyon pou benyen yo pi favorab?","The correct answer is **D: Long Bay**.

The passage states: ""Plaj North Shore yo (nan zòn North Harbiur) twouve l sou oseyan Pasifik la epi etann li sou **Long Bay** nan nò..."" This indicates that Long Bay is part of the North Shore beaches known for safe swimming. While other areas are mentioned, Long Bay is specifically linked to safe swimming conditions.
"
"Pandan vizit nan kote yo dekri nan pasaj la, kiyès nan sa yo ke yo ka konsidere ki pa apwopriye?","The correct answer is **C: Fè blag**. 

The passage specifically states: ""Pa fè blag sou Holocauste oswa Nazis yo."" (Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.) This directly addresses making jokes as inappropriate behavior.

Here's why the other options are not as directly addressed or as inappropriate in the same way:

*   **A: Aji de fason solanèl (Acting inappropriately):** This is a very broad statement. While acting inappropriately would generally be wrong, the passage gives more specific examples of inappropriate behavior.
*   **B: Kite yon mak yon kote sou yon sit (Leaving a mark somewhere on a site):** This is generally disrespectful, but the passage focuses on more direct forms of desecration.
*   **D: Grate yon estrikti (Scratching a structure):** This is explicitly forbidden in the passage.

Therefore, making jokes about the Holocaust/Nazis is the most direct and explicitly forbidden behavior described in the passage.
"
Kiyès nan tèm sa yo ki dekri lang lingua francas yo?,"The correct answer is **D: Òganik**.

Here's why:

The definition of a lingua franca, as stated in the prompt, is a natural or organic language that becomes dominant for communication between speakers of different languages.  ""Òganik"" (organic) best describes a language that develops naturally and evolves over time, which is precisely what a lingua franca is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Atifisyèl (Artificial):**  Lingua francas are *not* artificial languages.
*   **B: Kont nati (Unnatural):** While perhaps a slightly more evocative way to describe a lingua franca (as it's not consciously designed), ""òganik"" is a more direct and accurate descriptor.
*   **C: Konstwi (Constructed):**  This refers to constructed languages (conlangs) like Esperanto, which are intentionally created, not naturally evolved.

"
Ki deklarasyon ki pa dekri kòrèkteman lang oksilyè yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Yo se lang òganik yo itilize pou pèmèt moun kominike fasilman, si yo pa t egziste, yonn pa t ap konprann lòt.**

Here's why:

*   **The definition of auxiliary languages (lang oksilyè) in the prompt specifically states they are *artificial* languages, not natural (òganik) ones.** They are created *to facilitate communication* when natural languages are a barrier.
*   Option A directly contradicts this by stating they are ""òganik yo"" (organic/natural) and implying that communication would be impossible without them.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **B: Yo se lang ki alafwa natirèl e konstwi** - While not *all* auxiliary languages might have some natural language influence, the prompt clearly defines them as constructed. This option isn't entirely accurate but is closer than A.
*   **C: Yo se lang yo konstwi pou amelyore senaryo kominikasyon difisil yo** - This aligns perfectly with the prompt's description.
*   **D: Se lang dominan yo ki kreye yo ant moun ki pale diferan lang** - This describes a lingua franca, not an auxiliary language.

Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't accurately describe auxiliary languages based on the given definition.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa yon pasaje ta dwe verifye si kwazyè li a ap fèt nan sezon livè?","The correct answer is **A: Anplasman kabin nan** (The location of the cabin).

The passage explicitly states: ""Si ou travèse nò Baltik an ivè, verifye anplasman kabin lan..."". This translates to: ""If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin..."".

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Egzijans nan kesyon viza** (Visa requirements): The passage mentions that cruise passengers don't need visas (but to check conditions), not visa requirements.
* **C: Kondisyon yo** (Conditions):  The passage mentions checking conditions generally, but specifically refers to checking the cabin location.
* **D: Ki kantite tan l ap pase nan vil la** (How much time they will spend in the city): This is mentioned as part of the St. Petersburg cruise, but not as a general check related to winter Baltic Sea crossings.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, si kwazyè yon pasaje ap pati nan sezon ete, kisa li ka evite?","The correct answer is **C: Egzijans nan kesyon viza**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kwazyè nan Sen Pitèsboug yo gen ladn yo tan nan vil la. Pasajè kwazyè yo **pa bezwen viza** (gade kondisyon yo).""

This means that if a cruise passenger is traveling in the summer (which is generally considered the ""season"" for cruises), they can avoid the need for a visa.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tan nan vil:** The passage says cruises *include* time in the city.
*   **B: Travèse glas:** The passage warns about ice crossing in winter.
*   **D: Saint Petersburg:**  Saint Petersburg is the location of the cruises, not something a passenger can avoid in general.



"
Poukisa yo souvan itilize Katalan pou ansèy yo ak pou anons yo nan Baselòn?,"The correct answer is **B: Se te premye lang ofisyèl vil la (It was the first official language of the city).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Antouka, nan preske tout pano yo se an katalan yon bay endikasyon yo paske la lwa di lang sa se premye lang ofisyèl."" (Anyway, on almost all signs, a certain indication is in Catalan because the law says that language is the first official language.)
* While other options might be partially true (Catalan is widely preferred, and the metro has multilingual announcements), the primary reason for the prevalence of Catalan, especially on signs, is its status as the first official language.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Yo pi vit konprann li pase Panyòl la (They understand it faster than Spanish):** The passage doesn't provide information about comprehension speed.
* **C: Se lang prefere a Baselòn (It is the preferred language of Barcelona):** While many people prefer Catalan, the official status is the key factor here.
* **D: Metro a ak lòt sèvis piblik yo prensipalman se moun ki pale Katalan ki frekante yo (The metro and other public services are mainly frequented by Catalan speakers):** The passage doesn't confirm this.  The multilingual announcements suggest a broader usage.



"
"Pami lang sa yo, kiyès sistèm Metro Baselòn nan regilyèman itilize pou pase anons yo?","The correct answer is **C: Panyòl**.

The text states: ""Anons regilyè yo nan metwo a pa fèt an katalan, men pàn ki pat prevwa yo anonse pa yon sistèm otomatize nan yon gwo varyete lang tankou espanyòl, anglè, Fransè, Arab epi Japonè."" This means the automated system uses Spanish to make announcements.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, pami ekipman sa yo, kiyès li posib pou yo pa konsidere kòm yon priyorite nan yon chanm otèl wo nivo ki enkli dejne?","The correct answer is **D: WiFi rapid**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that luxury B&Bs compete on ""Cabin and Breakfast."" The descriptions focus on high-end cabins (hand-woven linens, antiques) and gourmet breakfasts featuring regional dishes or the chef's specialties. The ambiance (historic house, private grounds, pool) is also highlighted.

While WiFi is desirable in any hotel, the passage doesn't mention it as a key differentiator for *luxury* B&Bs in the same way as the other options.  The focus is on unique, handcrafted elements, regional cuisine, and a specific atmosphere.  WiFi, while expected, isn't presented as a defining feature of a high-end B&B in this context.

Therefore, WiFi rapid is the least likely to be considered a priority *within the context of what the passage describes as defining luxury B&Bs*.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan sa yo ki pa yonn nan pwen prensipal konkirans ant chanm de liks yo?","The correct answer is **A: Dekorasyon modèn**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that B&Bs compete primarily on ""Kabann ak Manje maten"" (Cabins and Breakfast). 
* It details the types of cabins (luxury, handmade linens, antiques) and breakfast (local dishes, chef's specialties).
* Therefore, **modern decoration** is not mentioned as a primary point of competition. The focus is on the cabin's character (often leaning towards antique or handcrafted) and the breakfast experience.

Let's look at why the other options are relevant:

* **B: Yon seri ti dejne ki adapte a sezon an (A series of breakfasts adapted to the season)** This falls directly under the ""Manje maten"" point of competition.
* **C: Akseswa kabann wo nivo (High-level cabin accessories)** This is a key element of the ""Kabann"" point of competition (handmade linens, antiques).
* **D: Manje ak bwason orijin lokal (Local food and drink)**  This is a crucial part of the ""Manje maten"" and a way to differentiate the B&B.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan aktivite sa yo ki pa t fèt Peken an 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Evènman ki lye ak ski nan Taizicheng**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that while the opening and closing ceremonies, and the indoor ice competitions, were held in Beijing, the ski events took place in the Taizicheng domain in Zhangjiakou, which is 220 km from Beijing.

Therefore, option B is the only activity that *didn't* occur in Beijing.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, pami evènman sa yo, kiyès ladan yo k ap fèt Peken an 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Evènman sou glas k ap fèt andedan**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Peken ap asire ouvèti ak fèmti seremoni an, lap òganize tou konpetisyon sou glas pa anndan."" This directly confirms that ice competitions are being held *inside* Beijing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Olempik Ete:** The passage mentions that Beijing is the *first* city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics, but it doesn't say the Summer Olympics are being held in Beijing in 2022.
* **C: Olenmpik livè:** While the Winter Olympics are being held in Beijing, the question asks which events are *specifically* being held in Beijing.
* **D: Seremoni fèmti an:** The passage states Beijing will host the closing ceremony, but it doesn't specify that the ceremony *itself* is happening in Beijing – it just says the city is hosting it.
"
Kiyès ki plis riske pou pran grip avyè?,"The correct answer is **C: Moun k ap travay nan sektè volay**.

The provided text states: ""Pi fò nan yo enplike moun ki ap travay nan volay yo..."" which translates to ""Most of them involve people who work in poultry..."" This directly indicates that people working in the poultry sector are at higher risk. While bird watchers are at *some* risk, poultry workers are identified as being at the highest risk.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki pi byen dekri grip avyè a ak presizyon?","The best answer is **C: Obsèvatè zwazo yo gen chans pou yo enfekte.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pi fò nan yo enplike moun ki ap travay nan volay yo, men gen kèk risk pou moun kap gade zwazo yo.""  This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sèlman moun k ap travay nan sektè volay la ki te pran grip la:** The passage says most cases involve poultry workers, but it also states there's risk for birdwatchers. This is inaccurate.
* **B: Yo te rapòte plis ka sou moun ke sou zwazo yo:** The passage mentions fewer cases in animals than in humans.
* **D: Tout ka yo te rapòte sou moun yo te fatal:** The passage states that while some cases have been fatal, the number of cases reported to humans is less than a million, and not all have been fatal."
Ki lyen ki genyen ant lanmè blanch lan ak kanal Baltik?,"The correct answer is **C: Oseyan Atik ak Lanmè Baltik**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the White Sea-Baltic Canal ""relie oseyan Atik la ak lanmè Baltik la"" (connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea).
* The question asks about the link between the White Sea and the Baltic Canal.

The other options are incorrect:

* A: The Black Sea and Caspian Sea are linked by ancient routes mentioned in the passage, but not directly by the White Sea-Baltic Canal.
* B: Lake Onega and the Volga River are part of a route connecting the White Sea to the Caspian Sea, but the question is about the link between the White Sea and the Baltic Canal.
* D: The Southern Ocean and the Red Sea are geographically unrelated to the White Sea-Baltic Canal.

"Dapre pasaj la, nan ki tip de veyikil yo ka kenbe paspò yo pou yo pa deranje pasaje a?","The correct answer is **B: Tren ki vwayaje Lannuit yo**.

The passage specifically states: ""Nan tren lannwit yo, kondiktè yo kapab retire paspò yo pou somèy yo pa entewonp."" (On night trains, conductors can take passports to avoid disturbing sleep.)  This indicates that passports can be kept by conductors on night trains to avoid disturbing passengers.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè yo ka kontwole pyès idantite w nan kèk tren ki travèse fwontyè?","The correct answer is **D: Pandan tren an ap kouri**. 

The passage states: ""Nan kèk tren transfontalye enspeksyon an fèt pandan tren an ap mache..."" which translates to ""In some trans-border trains, the inspection is done while the train is running...""
"
"Pami pwoblèm sa yo, kiyès ki plis pwobab pou prezante pandan yon vwayaj nan zòn twopikal Singapour la?","The correct answer is **C: Kout chalè (Heat waves)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states Singapore is in the ""big tropics,"" meaning it's hot and sunny (often).
* Option C, ""Kout chalè,"" refers to heat waves, which are a common occurrence in tropical climates.
* The passage doesn't suggest any issues with shopping (B) or being harassed (A). 
* While getting lost is *possible* anywhere, it's not specifically highlighted as a likely problem related to the tropical environment of Singapore.



"
Kiyès ki ka vle evite manje patisri alman yo?,"The best answer is **A: Yon moun ki fè alèji grav a fwi ki gen kal yo (Someone with a severe allergy to fruits with skins).**

Here's why:

* **The text specifically mentions pastries made with fruits.** While it doesn't list *all* the fruits used, it highlights apples and cherries, both of which have skins. Someone with a fruit skin allergy would need to avoid these pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Yon moun ki prefere desè ki pi rich yo (Someone who prefers richer desserts):** The text actually *describes* German pastries as rich, so this person would likely *enjoy* them.
* **C: Yon moun ki pa renmen chokola (Someone who doesn't like chocolate):** The text doesn't mention chocolate as a prominent ingredient.
* **D: Yon moun ki prefere bagay dous ke bagay ki sale (Someone who prefers sweet to savory):** The text describes pastries as sweet, so this person would likely *enjoy* them.



"
Ki engredyan yo konsidere kòm yon eleman sezonye nan patisri alman an?,"The correct answer is **A: Pòm**.

The text explicitly states: ""Patisiri ki fèt ak fwi yo popilè, avèk pòm kwit an patisri tout lane an..."". This indicates that apples are a key, and therefore seasonal, ingredient in German pastries.

While nuts and cream are common, the text specifically highlights apples as a popular fruit used in pastries.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan konsèy sa yo ke yo pa rekòmande pou vwayaje ak kòb jis sou ou, yon bidjè limite?","The correct answer is **C: Mande moun kòb (Asking people for money)**.

The passage explicitly states the advice is *not* for travelers who ""plunder, fish, participate in illegal activities, beg, or exploit others for their own benefit."" Asking for money falls under the category of exploiting others and is therefore discouraged.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jwenn yon ti travay pou fè pandan vwayaj ou a (Getting a small job while traveling):** The passage mentions working while traveling as a valid option.
* **B: Rete fleksib parapò a nivo konfò ou (Be flexible regarding your level of comfort):**  The passage implies that sacrificing comfort is part of the approach.
* **D: Diminye depans yo tankou manje ak lojman (Reduce expenses like food and lodging):** This is the core focus of the passage.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès ki ka gen difikilte pou vwayaje ak yon ti kantite kòb limite?","The correct answer is **None of the above.**

The passage explicitly states that the advice is for people **willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability** to reduce expenses to a near-zero level. It also specifies that the advice is *not* for those who resort to illegal or exploitative means to fund their travel.

Let's look at why the options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yon moun ki renmen leve defi (Someone who loves to take challenges):** The passage assumes a willingness to sacrifice, not necessarily a love of challenges.
*   **B: Yon moun ki pa gen limit tan strik (Someone who doesn't have strict time limits):** While not mentioned, the sacrifice of time is implied. However, the primary concern isn't time flexibility *per se*.
*   **C: Yon moun ki prevwa travay a distans pandan vwayaj li (Someone who plans to work remotely during their trip):** The passage focuses *specifically* on limiting expenses, not on generating income during travel.
*   **D: Yon moun ki renmen swiv yon pakou (Someone who likes to follow a route):** The passage doesn't mention anything about following a route.

Therefore, none of the options accurately reflect the target audience described in the passage. The passage is geared towards those prepared for a very austere travel experience."
Kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki pa dekri kòrèkteman trajè ant Point Marion ak Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **B: Wout yo jis (The roads are easy)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the opposite of this. It says: ""pant rèd yo, wout piti yo ak viraj sere yo se yo k ap domine"" (steep grades, narrow roads, and sharp turns are dominant). This indicates the roads are *not* easy.

Here's why the other options *are* correctly described:

*   **A: Gen twonson wout long andeyò ki izole (There are long, isolated, and remote stretches of road):** The passage states the route passes ""pa teren izole yo dèyè peyi a"" (through isolated terrain behind the countryside).
*   **C: Limit vitès yo pa fasil respekte (Speed limits are not easy to respect):** The passage mentions speed limits are lower and ""respè estrik plis enpòtan toujou nan lòt seksyon yo"" (strict respect is always more important in other sections).
*   **D: Sèvis kominikasyon pa telefòn pata dwe yon pwoblèm (Mobile phone service should not be a problem):** The passage states ""sèvis telefoni mobil la pi fò isi a pase anpil lòt moso nan pakou an"" (mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other parts of the route).



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan sa yo ki ta dwe reprezante yon preyokipasyon majè pou chofè k ap sikile sou otowout Buffalo-Pittsburg la?","The correct answer is **C: Pran yon koub a twòp vitès**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""pant rèd yo, wout piti yo ak viraj sere yo se yo k ap domine."" (Steep grades, narrow roads, and tight curves are dominant.) This directly warns drivers about the dangers of speeding on this route.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Limit vitès yo afiche klèman pi ba pase nan seksyon avan yo ak swivan yo - jeneralman 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)."" (Speed limits are clearly posted lower than in the preceding and following sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h).) This reinforces the importance of adhering to the lower speed limits due to the road conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Absans sèvis selilè sifizan (Lack of sufficient cell service):** The passage *contradicts* this, stating, ""Poutan, sepandan, sèvis telefoni mobil la pi fò isi a pase anpil lòt moso nan pakou an, pa egzanp Pennsylvania Wilds yo."" (However, however, mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other parts of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.)
* **B: Pran yon koub a twòp vitès (Taking a curve too fast):** This is the best fit, as the passage specifically highlights tight curves and warns against speeding.
* **D: Souvan jwenn y ap travay sou wout (Often find them working on the road):** While road work *might* be a concern, it's not the *major* concern emphasized by the passage. The core concern is the road conditions themselves.



"
Kiyès nan eleman sa yo ki pa nesesè pou w ka òmanse fè canyoning?,"The correct answer is **D: Yon ti fòmasyon (A small formation)**.

Here's why:

* **Canyoning** involves navigating canyons, which can have dry or wet sections. 
* **Konn naje (Knowing how to swim)** is crucial because you'll likely be encountering water.
* **Bon jan kondisyon fizik (Good physical condition)** is important for navigating challenging terrain, climbing, and potentially rappelling.
* **Kapab sote (Being able to jump)** is often required to traverse gaps or reach certain spots within the canyon.
* **Yon ti fòmasyon (A small formation)** is irrelevant to the activity of canyoning. It doesn't contribute to the safety or ability to participate. 

Therefore, a small formation is not a necessary element for canyoning.
"
Kiyès nan eleman sa yo ki ka nesesè pou ka reyisi yon eskisyon nan canyoning?,"The best answer is **C: Sètifikasyon nan canyoning**. Here's why:

* **Canyoning is a potentially dangerous activity.**  Safety is paramount. A canyoning certification indicates the participant has received proper training in techniques, safety procedures, and risk assessment specific to canyoning. This is a *necessary* element for a successful and safe experience.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kapasite atletik avanse (Advanced athletic ability):** While helpful, advanced athletic ability isn't *essential*.  Proper training and technique are more important than raw athleticism. Someone with good fitness but no specific canyoning skills could be unsafe.
* **B: Gentan gen eksperyans nan plonje soumaren (Experience in scuba diving):** Scuba diving skills aren't directly transferable to canyoning.  Canyoning involves different skills like rappelling, scrambling, and navigating flowing water.
* **D: Konn naje (Knowing how to swim):** Knowing how to swim is *helpful*, but not *sufficient*. Canyoning often involves navigating fast-moving water, and swimming alone isn't always the safest option. Certification covers water safety in the context of canyoning.



Therefore, certification is the most crucial and directly relevant element for a successful canyoning experience.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki t ap itil yon moun ki anvizaje fè kanmping nan machin li?","The correct answer is **B: Yon machin ou ka kouche chèz yo ladan l**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kanpin nan machin posib si ou dispoze yon gwo minibis, yon SUV, yon bèlin oswa yon poz avèk chèz ki kapab alonje."" This translates to ""Camping in a car is possible if you have a large minivan, an SUV, a sedan, or a bed that can recline."" This directly implies that a reclinable seat or a bed that can be created within the car is necessary for comfortable car camping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Byen konnen ki limit machin ou an genyen (Knowing the limits of your car):** While knowing your car's limits is generally good driving practice, it's not specifically mentioned as a requirement for car camping in the passage.
* **C: Yon tant (A tent):** The passage says tents can attract negative attention on private property, implying it's not the ideal solution for discreet car camping.
* **D: Yon teren prive pou w kanpe (Private land to camp on):**  The passage mentions that camping on private property can attract negative attention, implying it's not a recommended practice.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa moun k ap fè kanping nan machin yo ta dwe evite si yo vle rete sou kontwòl?","The correct answer is **C: Monte yon tant nan vil la oswa sou yon teren prive.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Enstale yon tant sou yon pwopriyete prive oswa nan yon vil nenpòt ki gwosè a kapab fasilman atire atansyon negatif."" This directly addresses what someone should avoid to maintain control and avoid negative attention.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kondwi yon pi gwo machin, tankou yon SUV oswa yon minivan:** The passage actually mentions that camping *is* possible in larger vehicles like SUVs and minivans.
*   **B: Fè yon vwayaj ki pi long:** The passage mentions a long trip as part of the simplicity of owning your own car, implying it's not a problem.
*   **D: Manke alèz ak machin ou itilize a:** The passage emphasizes being familiar with your car and knowing its limits, suggesting comfort isn't the primary concern.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès ki te rekonstwi Casablanca dezyèm fwa a?","The correct answer is **D: Siltan Mawòk la**.

The passage states: ""Siltan mawoken an te rekonstwi vil la sou non Daru l-Badya..."" This directly answers the question of who rebuilt Casablanca a second time.
"
Kiyès ki te dezète vil modèn Casablanca apre katastwòf natirèl la?,"The correct answer is **B: Pòtigè yo**.

The text states: ""Pòtigè yo te kraze epi rekonstwi l sou non Casa Branca, pou abandone l aprè yon tranbleman tè an 1755."" (The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.)
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kijan etranje yo te fè rekonèt Sintra etranje yo?","The correct answer is **C: Komantè pozitif Lord Byron yo**.

The passage explicitly states that Sintra became famous due to ""un beau témoignage de Lord Byron sur ses merveilles"" which translates to ""a beautiful testimony of Lord Byron on its wonders.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabo da Roca:** Cabo da Roca is mentioned as a stop on the route to Sintra, not the reason for Sintra's fame.
* **B: Aparisyon Marian:**  The Marian apparitions are associated with Fátima, not Sintra.
* **D: Istwa womantik li yo:** While Sintra *is* romantic, the passage directly links its fame to Byron's comments.



"
Kisa Ameni pa rekonèt?,"The correct answer is **D: Nouvo repiblik la**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Okenn nasyon etabli - pa menm Ameni - pa rekonèt li ofisyèlman."" This means Armenia does not officially recognize the newly created republic in Nagorno-Karabakh.
"
Kisa ki kontinye afekte relasyon ki genyen ans Azerbaïdjan ak Ameni an?,"The correct answer is **D: Rejyon Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nan lane 1994, rejyon azèbadjanèz la Haut-Karabakh, ak popilasyon amenyèn lan te fè lagè ak Azéris yo. Avèk soutyen Amenyen yo, yon nouvèl repiblik te kreye."" This establishes the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region as the root cause.
* **The passage further states:** ""Diskisyon diplomatik yo sou rejyon an ap kontinye nwi relasyon yo ant Ameni ak Azèbayidjan."" This directly links discussions *about the region* to the strained relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Amenyen k ap viv Azerbaïdjan yo:** While the presence of Armenians in Azerbaijan might contribute to tensions, it's not the primary ongoing issue affecting relations. The core issue is the territory.
* **B: Gè nan lane 1994 la:** The war *created* the problem, but the ongoing issue isn't just the war itself. It's the unresolved territorial dispute that stemmed from the war.
* **C: Agiman diplomatik yo:** Diplomatic discussions are a *result* of the ongoing problem, not the root cause. They are attempts to resolve the underlying conflict.



Therefore, the Nagorno-Karabakh region is the central and continuing factor affecting relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
"
"Lè w ap pran taksi Charlotte, kisa ki ka fè w peye kòb anplis?","The correct answer is **B: Gen twa pasaje**.

The text states: ""Gen yon depans anplis pou gen plis pase 2 pasaje..."" which translates to ""There is an extra charge for having more than 2 passengers...""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki enkonvenyan ki genyen pou yon moun viv Charlotte ak timoun?","The correct answer is **B: Pran taksi**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Taksi yo pa jeneralman itilize pa fanmi yo nan Charlotte, menm si li ka itilize yo nan kèk sikonstans. Gen yon depans anplis pou gen plis pase 2 pasaje, donk opsyon sa kapab pi chè pase sak nesesè a."" This directly addresses the inconvenience of taking taxis in Charlotte with children due to cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pri kay yo:** The passage doesn't mention the cost of housing in Charlotte.
* **C: Rezidan nan lòt zòn yo:** The passage mentions that people from other regions often cite respect for family as a reason for moving to Charlotte. It doesn't present being from another region as an inconvenience for families *living* in Charlotte.
* **D: Eseye pwofite vil la:** The passage states the opposite - that visitors find Charlotte easy to enjoy with children. It doesn't mention any difficulty in enjoying the city.



"
"Anvan Panyòl yo te rive, kiyès ki te kontwole pati nò peyi Chili?","The correct answer is **D: Enkas yo**.

The passage states: ""Pati Nò Chili te sou dominasyon Inca..."" which translates to ""The northern part of Chile was under Inca domination...""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan evènman sa yo ki pa t fèt an 1810?","The correct answer is **B: Chili ranpòte laviktwa sou Panyòl yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while Chile declared independence in 1810, the final victory over the Spanish didn't occur until 1818. Therefore, Chile did *not* win the war against the Spanish in 1810.

Let's look at why the other options *were* true in 1810:

* **A: Pa t gen gouvènman santral** - The passage mentions that Napoleon's wars left Spain without a functional central government, which would have been true in 1810.
* **C: Gè Napoleonyen yo te dewoule** - The passage explicitly states the declaration of independence happened *during* the Napoleonic Wars.
* **D: Chili deklare endepandans li** - The passage clearly states Chile declared independence in 1810.



"
Kijan pou yon moun ale nan vilaj izole ki nan rejyon Ligurie yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Nan tren oswa nan bato** (By train or by boat).

The text states: ""Chemen yo, tren yo ak bato ki relye vilaj yo, machin yo pa kapab rive deyò a."" This translates to: ""The paths, trains and boats connect the villages, cars cannot reach outside.""  Therefore, the only modes of transportation mentioned for reaching the villages are train and boat.
"
Kisa tèm italyen ‘Cinque Terre’ a vle di?,"The correct answer is **A: Senk vilaj (Five Villages)**.

The text explicitly states that Cinque Terre consists of five coastal villages: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, and Monterosso. ""Cinque Terre"" literally translates to ""Five Lands"" or ""Five Villages"" in Italian.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki tip de bòt ki adapte a kondisyon tan livè lè li posib pou glise anpil yo?","The correct answer is **B: Bòt a kranpon (Boots with crampons)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that ""Kèk bòt yo gen kranpon epi gen yon ekipman konplemantè ak kranpon yo pou kondisyon glise yo..."" (Some boots have crampons and come with a complementary set of crampons for slippery conditions...). This indicates that boots with crampons are designed for situations where a lot of slipping is possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bòt ki gen talon mens (Boots with thin heels):** The passage states heels should be low and wide, not thin.
*   **C: Bòt ki gen semèl wo (Boots with high soles):** The passage states the sole should be deep (5mm or more), not high.
*   **D: Bòt san motif ki gen 1/5 pous pwofondè (Boots with no pattern and 1/5 inch depth):** The passage explicitly says the sole should be deep (5mm or more) and have a pattern.



"
Kiyès nan eleman sa yo ki pa kontribye pou amelyore traksyon sou wout ki gen glas nan sezon livè yo?,"The correct answer is **D: Dlo**.

Here's why:

*   **Sèl (Salt), Gravye (Gravel), and Sab (Sand)** are all used to improve traction on icy roads. They provide a rougher surface for tires or shoes to grip.
*   **Dlo (Water)** on its own, especially when frozen to form ice, *decreases* traction. While salt can help melt ice *caused* by water, water itself isn't a traction-improving agent.

Therefore, water doesn't contribute to improving traction on icy roads in the winter."
Kiyès nan pwen sa yo ki se menm bagay ant Hawaï ak Cook Island yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo gen menm fizo orè**.

The passage states: ""Avèk menm fizo orè ak Hawaii..."" which translates to ""With the same time zone as Hawaii...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yo tou lè de gen anpil gwo otèl:** The passage says the Cook Islands *don't* have big hotels, unlike Hawaii.
*   **B: Okenn nan yo pa gen estati eta:** The passage doesn't mention the state status of either location.
*   **D: Yo toulède pa gen okenn vil:** The passage explicitly states that the Cook Islands are composed of 15 different islands, and they *don't* have any cities. Hawaii *does* have cities.



"
Kiyès nan enonse sa yo ki pa dekri Cook Island yo kòrèkteman?,"The correct answer is **A: Li pi piti pase Hawaii**.

The passage states that the Cook Islands are sometimes considered ""Hawaii down under,"" implying they are *not* smaller than Hawaii. In fact, the passage mentions they are comparable to Hawaii in terms of the experience they offer.

Here's why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Li se yon achipèl:** The passage explicitly states, ""Se yon achipèl ki gen 15 zile..."" (It is an archipelago with 15 islands...)
* **C: Prensipal vil yo se Rarotonga ak Aitutaki:** The passage says, ""Sa ki prensipal yo se Rawotonga ak Ayitutaki."" (The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.)
* **D: Peyi zile a pataje menm fizo orè ak Hawaii:** The passage states, ""Avèk menm fizo orè ak Hawaii..."" (With the same time zone as Hawaii...)



"
Kiyès nan estasyon gad forè sa yo ki pwopoze de tip lojman?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sirenan se sèl estasyon gad forè ki ofri lojman an dòtwa epi repa cho anplis kanpin lan."" (Sirena is the only ranger station that offers lodging in huts and hot meals in addition to camping.)

The other options only offer camping:

*   Los Patos: ""ofri sèlman kanpin san sèvis restorasyon"" (offers only camping without restaurant service)
*   La Leona: ""ofri sèlman kanpin san sèvis restorasyon"" (offers only camping without restaurant service)
*   San Pedrillo: ""ofri sèlman kanpin san sèvis restorasyon"" (offers only camping without restaurant service)



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki kote yon moun ka rezève yon pèmi aksè nan yon pak si nou vle itilize lajan kach olye de kat kredi?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

The passage states: ""It is possible to obtain a park permit at the Puerto Jiménez Ranger Station itself, but they do not accept credit cards.""  This directly answers the question about using cash instead of a credit card.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki tip de ski yo pratike sou teren ki pi rèd yo?","The correct answer is **A: Ski randone**.

The text specifically states: ""Pansan ak itinerè eski a tankou yon itinerè pwomenad parèy. Nan bon kondisyon wap ka kouvri plis distans ke mache – men wap atenn vitès de fond yo ke rarman siw pa gen yon sak a do lou sou yon pis prepare."" and ""eski randone tankou eski pou teren ki rèd yo."" This means ski de fond is more suitable for groomed trails, and ski de randonnée (ski touring) is for more challenging, off-piste terrain. Therefore, ski de randonnée is the correct choice.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki ka ede moun k ap fè eski randone ki vle pran plis vitès yo?","The correct answer is **B: Yon sak a do ki lou**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...wap atenn vitès de fond yo **ke rarman siw pa gen yon sak a do lou sou yon pis prepare**."" 

This means that a heavy backpack hinders speed on groomed slopes. Therefore, a heavy backpack *prevents* you from achieving top speeds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Soulye rijid** - The passage mentions rigid boots as a characteristic of alpine skiing, but it doesn't connect them to achieving speed.
*   **C: Bon kondisyon** - While good condition helps, the passage directly links speed to the presence or absence of a heavy backpack on groomed slopes.
*   **D: Pis prepare** - Groomed slopes themselves don't inherently help with speed. It's the *combination* of groomed slopes and the lack of a heavy backpack that allows for faster movement.



"
Kisa vwayajè ki sibi chòk yo an retou yo gen difikilte pou yo fè?,"The correct answer is **D: Readapte yo a kilti orijin yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Vwayajè ki te gen pwoblèm pou adapte yo ak nouvèl kilti a gen pafwa anpil pwoblèm pou re adapte yo ak kilti orijin yo a."" This directly addresses the difficulty returning home presents for travelers who experienced culture shock.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, chòk rantre a ta ka espesyalman difisil pou ki tip vwayajè?","The correct answer is **A: Vwayajè ki te sibi chòk kiltirèl ki te patikilyèman vyolan.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vwayajè ki te gen pwoblèm pou adapte yo ak nouvèl kilti a gen pafwa anpil pwoblèm pou re adapte yo ak kilti orijin yo a.""  This directly links a difficult cultural adjustment (culture shock) to a difficult reintegration (re-entry shock). Therefore, those who experienced severe culture shock are likely to face a particularly difficult re-entry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vwayajè ki te adapte yo byen vit pandan y ap viv aletranje:**  The passage implies that easy adaptation abroad *might* make re-entry *more* difficult, not less.
* **C: Vwayajè ki toujou nan faz lin de myèl:** ""One of the honeymoon phases"" refers to the initial positive feelings abroad. This doesn't necessarily predict difficulties upon returning home.
* **D: Vwayajè ki gen mwens pasyans:** The passage *specifically* notes that others abroad were patient and understanding *because* they knew adjusting to a new culture takes time.  This suggests those *without* patience might struggle, but it's not the most direct answer based on the passage's core argument.



"
Kiyès nan sa yo moun yo ta dwe evite fè ak elan an?,"The correct answer is **C: Redwi nivo menas potansyèl yo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that elk aren't inherently aggressive, but they will defend themselves if they feel threatened. Therefore, to avoid danger, you should *reduce the potential threat* you pose to the elk. Options A, B, and D don't directly address minimizing the threat.  Ignoring them, approaching slowly, or observing from a distance might be good practices, but reducing the *potential threat* is the most direct way to avoid a defensive reaction.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo konsènan elan an ki pa laverite?","The incorrect statement is **A: Yo se bèt ki natirèlman agresif (They are naturally aggressive animals)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Orinyal (yo rele tou elan) pa fèt tou agresif"" which translates to ""Elans (they are also called elans) are not born naturally aggressive."" The other options are all supported by the passage.

Here's why the other options are correct:

*   **B: Pafwa yo pa wè yo kòm yon menas potansyèl (Sometimes they are not seen as a potential threat)** - The passage says people don't always consider them dangerous.
*   **C: Yo ka deklantche akoz moun ki tou pre yo (They can be triggered by people who are too close)** -  The passage says people can get too close and put themselves in danger.
*   **D: Y ap defann tèt yo si sa nesesè (They will defend themselves if necessary)** - This is directly stated in the passage.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ki t ap mwens danjre pou yon vwayajè nan dezè?","The correct answer is **B: Wè yon miraj ki bay ilizyon dlo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that pursuing mirages is dangerous because it wastes energy and remaining water.** However, *seeing* a mirage itself isn't inherently dangerous. The danger comes from the *action* of chasing it.
* **A: Yon mank rad ki cho pandan yon nwit ki frèt** - Hypothermia is a real risk, making this dangerous.
* **C: Gaspiye enèji pandan y ap pouswiv yon miraj** - This is dangerous and a result of the pursuit.
* **D: Gaspiye dlo pandan y ap pouswiv yon miraj** - This is also dangerous and a result of the pursuit.

Therefore, seeing a mirage is the least immediately dangerous of the options presented, as the danger stems from the subsequent action of pursuing it."
Kilès nan sa yo ki pa mansyone kòm yon menas potansyèl pou vwayajè nan dezè a?,"The correct answer is **D: Boule nan Solèy (Solar Flares)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions **mirages**, **dehydration (implied by ""gaspiye tou yon enèji ki chè epi dlo ki rete a"")**, and **hypothermia** as threats.
* **Solar flares** are a phenomenon related to the sun, but they are not mentioned in the passage as a danger for desert travelers.  The primary concerns in a desert environment are heat, lack of water, and temperature drops at night.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki popilasyon gwoup ki te afekte anpil aprè eksploratè yo te rive?","The correct answer is **C: Tayinos Yo**.

The passage states: ""Popilasyon Tayinòs yo te redwi yon mannyè konsiderab aprè arive eksploratè ewopeyen yo..."" (The Taíno population was greatly reduced after the arrival of European explorers...).
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki lang Karibeyen yo te plis pale?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The passage states that the Caribes were a people who spoke an Arawakan language.
"
Kilès nou dwe di ki te popilarize ski antanke aktivite rekreyatif?,"The correct answer is **B: Nòvejyen yo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""an 1861, premye klèb eski rekreyatif te louvri pa Nòvejyen yo an Ostrali."" This directly indicates that the Norwegians were the ones who established the first recreational ski club, thus popularizing skiing as a recreational activity. While the text mentions amateurs enjoying skiing, it doesn't state they popularized it.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, nan apeprè kilè yo te rekonèt ski kòm yon espò pandan premye fwa?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 BC**.

The passage states: ""Lide eski a ansyen anpil — penti kavèn yo reprezante eskyè yo remonte ak 5000 lane avan Jezi Kris."" (The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depict skiers dating back 5000 years before Jesus Christ.)
"
Kilès nan sa yo ki jeneralman asosye ak pi gran zile nan kot lès Afriken la?,"The correct answer is **D: Otèl liks**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Madagaska se pi gran, e yon kontinan poukol nan sa ki gen pou we ak lafonn. Pi fò ti zile son bann nasyon endepandan oubyen nasyon asosye ak Lafrans epi yo rekonèt pou bèl plaj liksye yo.""  This directly links Madagascar (the largest island) with luxury beaches and hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Enfliyans ewopeyen:** While European influence started in the 15th century, it's not the *primary* association with Madagascar.
* **B: Relijyon islamik:** Islam was brought to some islands (like Comoros and Mayotte), but not necessarily strongly associated with Madagascar as a whole.
* **C: Abita pou fo n la:**  The passage doesn't mention Madagascar being known for its rhino population.



"
Kisa ki pa yon atribi nan zile Lès Afriken ki pi piti yo? ,"The correct answer is **D: Endepandans de lòt nasyon yo (Independence from other nations)**.

Here's why:

The text states that most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France. Option D directly contradicts this information. Options A, B, and C are all mentioned as characteristics of the islands.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, Kijan kèk legliz tradisyonèl presi selebre Pak?","The correct answer is **B: Òganizasyon yon veye Samdi swa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Legliz ki plis tradisyonèl yo òganize on Vèye nan samdi pandan wikenn Pak lan..."" This directly answers the question of how some traditional churches celebrate Passover.
"
"Pou kapab evite sèten kondisyon lè yon sitwayen Kiben ap antre an Ekwatè, kisa li dwe genyen an premye?","The correct answer is **B: Yon lèt envitasyon ki legalize**.

Here's why:

The prompt clearly states: ""Ekwatè egzije sitwayen kiben yo resevwa yon lèt envitasyon avan antre an Ekwatè pa ayewopò entènasyonal yo oswa pwen admisyon fwontalye yo."" This is the primary requirement mentioned for entry.

While the other options are also requirements, they are secondary to the invitation letter. The invitation letter is a prerequisite for needing a valid passport, a return ticket, and dealing with a Green Card.

Therefore, the most crucial requirement to *avoid certain conditions* (which implies allowing entry) is the legalized invitation letter.
"
Pou kilès rezon yo pa konsevwa kondisyon vwayaj Ekwatè yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Mentni yon kantite migrasyon ki òganize**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the requirements are ""vize pou asire yon mouvman migratwa òganize ant de peyi yo.""  The other options are also factors in travel requirements, but the primary purpose mentioned is organization of migration.
"
Kilès nan sa yo ki ka koute plis lajan nan yon peyi etranje pase nan peyi w?,"The correct answer is **B: Monti wo nivo (High-end glasses)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Kad mak siperyè ki disponib nan rejyon sa yo kapab genyen de pwoblèm; ou kapab jwenn genyen ki se fotokopi, epi orijinal kad yo enpòte yo kapab vann pi chè pase pri yo vann lakay yo.""  This clearly indicates that high-end glasses (monti wo nivo) *can* be more expensive in a foreign country due to import costs and potential inflated prices.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Egzamen zye (Eye exam):**  The paragraph suggests eye exams *might* be cheaper in poorer countries, especially if covered by insurance.
* **C: Asirans pou vizyon (Vision insurance):**  The paragraph mentions checking insurance coverage, implying that the cost of insurance itself might be a factor, but it doesn't say it will necessarily be *more* expensive abroad.
* **D: Monti san mak (Branded glasses):** While the paragraph notes potential fake branded glasses, it doesn't state that branded glasses are *always* more expensive abroad.  Import costs could make them more expensive, but it's not guaranteed.



"
Kisa ki ta ka yon risk potansyèl nan acha monti wo nivo nan yon peyi etranje?,"The best answer is **C: Yo kapab fo (They could be counterfeit)**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph specifically mentions:** ""Yon kad mak siperyè ki disponib nan rejyon sa yo kapab genyen de pwoblèm; ou kapab jwenn genyen ki se fotokopi, epi orijinal kad yo enpòte yo kapab vann pi chè pase pri yo vann lakay yo.""  This directly addresses the risk of counterfeit glasses.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Yon lòt egzamen zye kapab obligatwa (Another eye exam may be required):** While this *could* happen, it's not the primary risk highlighted in the text.
* **B: Preskripsyon an kapab pa valid pou sèten monti (The prescription may not be valid for certain frames):** This is a possibility, but not the main concern raised.
* **D: Asirans lan kapab pa kouvri frè a (The insurance may not cover the cost):** This is also a possibility, but the paragraph focuses on the quality and authenticity of the glasses themselves, not insurance coverage.

Therefore, the most direct and relevant risk mentioned in the text is the potential for fake glasses.
"
"Pou sa ki konsène itilizasyon deviz nan Falklands, kilès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki se laverite?","The correct answer is **D: Apa de liv Falkland nan, liv Sterling nan se jeneral deviz yo plis aksepte.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Lajan ka chanje sèlman nan yon sèl bank sou zile lan ki chita kòl Stanley bò magazen Lwès FIC. Liv stèlen jeneralman aksepte tout kote nan zile a..."" This directly supports statement D.
* **Statement A is incorrect:** The text mentions that while credit cards *may* be accepted in remote areas, they aren't guaranteed.
* **Statement B is incorrect:** The text doesn't say that Stanley is the *only* place US dollars are accepted; it only says they are ""accepted often.""
* **Statement C is incorrect:** The text explicitly says it's ""preske enposib pou chanje lajan zile Malwin yo lèw yon lòt kote, kidonk chanje lajan avan ou kite zile a.""



"
"Dapre pasaj la, lè w ap vwayaje nan Falklands yo soti Etazini, kikote yon fòm peman ki diferan de yon kat kredi kapab espesyalman itil?","The correct answer is **A: Nan magazen FIC West la**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the official currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP) pegged to the GBP.
* The only bank on the island where currency can be exchanged is located at the West FIC store in Stanley.
* While GBP and USD are often accepted, credit cards aren't guaranteed to be accepted, especially in the outer islands.
* The passage explicitly mentions the need to exchange money *before* leaving the island, implying it's difficult to do so once you're there.

Therefore, the West FIC store is the only place mentioned for exchanging currency, making it the most relevant and useful option for travelers arriving from the US who might not rely solely on credit cards.



"
Ki evènman ki pa asosye ak selebrasyon festival tanp yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Nesans yon elefan**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that most temple festivals are held to celebrate the temple's anniversary, the anniversary of a deity, or other major events *related to the temple*.  A newborn elephant is not directly related to a temple anniversary or deity anniversary. The other options (B, C, and D) are all mentioned as reasons for holding temple festivals.
"
Kilè yo ka wè elefan ki dekore yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Tout kote apati fen Novanm jiska mitan mwa Me**.

The passage states: ""Pi fò festival ki fèt nan tanp lan reyalize nan kad anivèsè tanp lan oubyen anivèsè divinite oubyen nenpòt lòt gwo evènman ki gen rapò ak tanp lan. Festival tanp Kerala enteresan anpil pou moun we avek elefan ki dekore..."" and then ""Pifò festival tanp Kerala gen elefan ki dekore.""  It also mentions the festival period is from November to mid-May. Therefore, you can see the decorated elephants during that entire period.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Nan tanp yo:** While elephants might be *at* temples during festivals, the passage doesn't limit their presence *only* to temples.
* **C: Nan laposesyon nan festival nan tanp yo:** This is too restrictive. Elephants are present during the festival period, not exclusively *during* the festival.
* **D: Nan lari Kerala:** While it's *possible* you might see elephants in Kerala's streets during this time due to festivals, the passage doesn't specifically state that this is where they are seen.  The passage indicates they are a feature of the temple festivals.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ki se fason ki plis posib pou ekonomize lajan sou biyè avyon nan klas biznis oswa premye klas?","The correct answer is **A: Depans l nan antrepriz ou an**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...or, even better, ask your company to do it for you."" This directly indicates that having your company pay for the upgrade is a way to avoid personal expense.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Rezève premye klas olye de klas biznis:** The passage says it's generally not useful to seek discounts for business class or first class fares on direct flights.
*   **C: Rezève yon vòl premye klas ki pa dirèk:** The passage doesn't mention this as a way to save money.
*   **D: Jwenn yon rabè:** The passage explicitly states that finding discounts is generally not useful for upgrading to business or first class.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki t ap yon gaspiyaj tan pou chèche lè w ap rezève sèten klas tarif?","The correct answer is **C: Rabè**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Un manie general, il n'est pas utile de chercher à obtenir des réductions pour un siège en classe affaires ou en première classe vol direct de A à B."" which translates to ""In general, it is not useful to look for discounts for a seat in business class or first class direct flight from A to B."" This means searching for discounts is a waste of time.
"
Kisa ki pa dwe ajoute pandan konparezon yon devi tarif total pou ale an Afrik ak yon tarif pou vwayaje nan tout monn lan?,"The correct answer is **A: Frè pou viza adisyonèl pou kote andeyò Afrik**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks to compare the *total* cost of a trip to Africa with a trip around the world.**  The trip around the world includes travel *outside* of Africa, so any visa fees for those other locations *must* be included in the ""around the world"" cost.
* **The prompt specifically mentions adding expenses *outside* of Africa.** This means visas for other countries are relevant to the comparison.
* **B, C, and D** all relate to expenses incurred *outside* of Africa and are part of calculating the total cost of a trip around the world, so they should be included.

Therefore, the only option that *should not* be added when comparing the cost of a trip to Africa versus a trip around the world is the visa fees for countries *outside* of Africa.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki sipèmache ki kòmanse ofri yon seleksyon ki plis divèsifye nan?","The correct answer is **A: Manje prepare**.

The passage states: ""Chak jou pi plis, magasen yo ap gen yon etalaj ki plis varye ak pla tou prepare yo."" (Every day more and more, stores are having a more varied display of prepared foods as well.)

Therefore, supermarkets are starting to offer a more diversified selection of **prepared foods**.
"
Ki resous sipèmache yo bay ki ta ka atire yon kliyan pou achte manje ki prepare?,"The correct answer is **A: Restoran sou plas**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kèk nan yo pwopoze menm yon fou ak mikwo ond oswa lòt mwayen pou chofe manje yo. **Restoran sou plas**, souvan yo pa fòmèl epi pri yo abòdab."" (Some even offer an oven or microwave or other means to heat food. **Restaurants on site**, often informal and affordable.)

The passage highlights restaurants on site as a key feature that attracts customers to purchase prepared food.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Seleksyon ki mwens varye** (Less varied selection) - The passage says the opposite - that the selection is *increasingly* varied.
* **C: Manje kri** (Bulk food) - The passage focuses on pre-made food, not bulk items.
* **D: Yon fou maykwowev** (A microwave oven) - While microwaves might be available, they aren't a unique or primary draw for prepared food, especially compared to an actual restaurant.



"
Kilès nan sa yo ke Bèlj ak Swis ki pale Fransè yo kapab pa konprann?,"The correct answer is **D: Fransè ki plis pale an Frans (French spoken more in France)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while the dialects are largely mutually intelligible, there are differences in pronunciation and the numbering system.
* The key difference highlighted is that while Belgians and Swiss speakers learn standard French, the *way French is spoken in France* can still have subtle differences they might not be immediately familiar with, especially regarding pronunciation nuances and idiomatic expressions.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Sistèm nimewotasyon Fransè estanda a (Standard French numbering system):** The passage explicitly says the numbering system is different, so they *can* understand it, just not necessarily use it.
* **B: Mo Fransè ki dwòl (Funny French words):** The passage doesn't mention ""funny French words"" being a problem.
* **C: Sèten pwononsiyasyon mo Fransè (Certain French word pronunciations):** The passage mentions pronunciation differences, but the sentence structure implies they *can* still understand due to learning standard French.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **D**.
"
Kilès nan sa yo ki pa menm bagay an Frans ke an Bèljik oswa Laswis?,"The correct answer is **B: Sistèm nimewotasyon an**.

Here's why:

* The question states that the numbering system in Belgian and Swiss French differs from that used in France.
* The passage also mentions slight differences in pronunciation and spelling, but those are less significant than the numbering system.
* While standardized French is taught in schools (C), it doesn't mean there aren't other differences.
* The pronunciation of all words (A) isn't different - only *some* words have slight pronunciation variations.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the numbering system is a difference found in Belgian and Swiss French that isn't present in standard French used in France.
"
Nan ki senaryo ou pa gen anpil chans pou yo pwopoze w yon tarif pou dèy?,"The correct answer is **B: Si ou eseye rezève dirèkteman ak konpayi ayeryèn yon sèvis tyès pati**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that only a *few* airlines offer last-minute fares.
* It further specifies those airlines: Air Canada, Delta, Lufthansa (for flights from US/Canada), and WestJet.
* The key phrase is ""rezève nan telefòn dirèkteman bò kote konpayi konsène an"" (reserve directly on the airline's phone). This implies that last-minute fares are *only* available by contacting the airline directly.
* Option B describes trying to reserve through a ""sèvis tyès pati"" (third-party service), which would *not* be a direct reservation with the airline. Therefore, you would not be likely to get a last-minute fare in this scenario.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Si w ap vwayaje nan WestJet:** WestJet *is* one of the airlines mentioned as offering last-minute fares.
* **C: Si w ap vwayaje nan Lufthansa soti Paris jiska Ozetazini:** Lufthansa *does* offer last-minute fares for flights from the US/Canada. The origin of the flight (Paris) is irrelevant based on the information provided.
* **D: Si w ap vwayaje nan Delta:** Delta *is* one of the airlines mentioned as offering last-minute fares.



"
Kisa ki se laverite sou tarif pou dèy la?,"The correct answer is **D: Yo dwe rezève dirèkteman avèk konpayi ayeryèn lan nan telefòn**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Nan tout ka yo, ou dwe rezève nan telefòn dirèkteman bò kote konpayi konsène an."" (In all cases, you must book directly by phone with the concerned company.)
* Option A is incorrect; the passage clearly states the fares are for *last-minute travel expenses*, not funeral costs.
* Option B is incorrect; the passage states you must book *by phone*, not on the website.
* Option C is partially correct but incomplete. While the fares are for last-minute travel, the passage also specifies the booking method.



"
Lè itilizasyon yon aparèy GPS otonòm t ap plis pratik pase yon aplikasyon navigasyon GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: Lè ou p ap konekte**.

Here's why:

The passage states that GPS navigation apps on smartphones can be limited or impossible to use without data connection or when outside of range.  An autonomous GPS device is *more* practical in these situations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lè w ap eseye ekonomize lajan:** The passage mentions that you can *buy* new GPS maps or rent devices, implying that autonomous devices are not necessarily cheaper upfront.
* **B: Lè ou sèten w ap genyen koneksyon done:**  If you're sure you'll have data, a smartphone app is likely more convenient.
* **D: Lè ou pa vle lwe yon aparèy:** This is irrelevant to whether an autonomous device is *more practical*.  The question is about practicality in the context of connectivity.



"
Kisa ki pa yon bon rezon pou itilize yon aplikasyon navigasyon GPS parapò ak yon aparèy otonòm?,"The correct answer is **A: Pa bezwen enkyete sou yon koneksyon done** (Don't worry about a data connection).

Here's why:

The passage states that a limitation of using a smartphone GPS navigation app is that performance can be limited or impossible **if you don't have a data connection or are outside of range.**  Therefore, the ability to *not* worry about a data connection is *not* a good reason to use the app, but rather a drawback.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ekonomize lajan (Save money):** The passage mentions that you can *save* money by using a smartphone app instead of buying a new GPS device or renting one. This is a valid reason *for* using the app.
*   **C: Evite lwaye (Avoid renting):**  Similar to saving money, the passage implies you can avoid renting by using a smartphone app.
*   **D: Pa bezwen achte nouvo kat (Don't need to buy new maps):**  The passage explicitly states you can *buy* new maps for a smartphone app.

Therefore, the only option that represents a *negative* aspect of using a smartphone GPS app, as described in the passage, is the lack of reliance on a data connection.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kijan ou ka garanti ke ou koresponn ak yon navi ki apwopriye?","The correct answer is **C: Fè rezèvasyon ak yon ajan ki espesyalize nan vwayaj Galapagos**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Asire ou ke ajan wap rezève a se yon espesyalis Galapagos ki gen bon jan konesans sou divèsite bato yo. Sa pral pèmèt pou fè koresponn enterè ou yo ak/oswa kontrent patikilye yo avèk bato a ki pi bon pou yo a.""  This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fè rezèvasyon nan yon gwoup 8+ pasaje ki gen enterè similè** - While this *could* be helpful, the passage doesn't say it's necessary to ensure a suitable ship. It's just mentioned as a potential group size.
* **B: Fè rezèvasyon pandan sezon fèb trafik la** - The passage mentions high season, but doesn't link booking during low season to finding a better ship.
* **D: Fè rezèvasyon lontan alavans** -  The passage states that most people book in advance, but doesn't say that booking early guarantees a suitable ship. It's just a practical tip.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ki pa itilize kòm yon taktik pou fè ensite kliyan yo pou kontinye jwe?","The correct answer is **A: Yon abondans limyè natirèl** (An abundance of natural light).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states casinos *avoid* making it easy to leave (difficult exit routes, windows and clocks hidden). This is a tactic to keep people playing.
* It also mentions offering food, drinks, and entertainment to create a pleasant atmosphere and encourage people to stay.
* It discusses the use of alcohol to impair judgment and keep players engaged.
* The other options are tactics described in the passage:
    * **Bwason konplimantè** (Complimentary drinks) are offered.
    * **Absans revèy** (Lack of clocks) is mentioned as a tactic.
    * **Ensitasyon tankou tikè gratis pou konsè** (Incentives like free concert tickets) falls under the category of offering entertainment to keep people engaged.

Therefore, an abundance of natural light is the *opposite* of a tactic used to keep customers playing, and isn't mentioned as being used by casinos in the passage.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa yon jwè ki entelijan ta dwe evite?","The correct answer is **A: Bwè twòp alkòl**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Sepandan, konsomasyon alkòl afekte jijman an, epi tout bon jwè yo konnen konbyen li enpòtan pou rete kal."" (However, alcohol consumption affects judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay calm.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aksepte nenpòt ensitasyon:** While casinos might try to encourage spending, the passage doesn't specifically say a smart player should avoid *all* invitations.
* **C: Verifye revèy oswa mont:** The passage mentions windows and clocks being hard to find, but it doesn't say a smart player should actively *verify* them.
* **D: Mande enfòmasyon sou sòti ki pi pre a:** The passage mentions difficult exits, but it doesn't say a smart player should avoid asking for directions.  A smart player might want to know their escape routes.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki pati nan diskou an ki an majiskil nan mitan yon fraz?","The correct answer is **B: Non**.

The passage states: ""Tout non, ki bò kote Sie pou ou, toujou kòmanse pa on lèt majiskil, menmsi li nan mitan yon fraz."" This directly indicates that nouns are capitalized in the middle of a sentence.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa lè yo mete yo an majiskil ki te ka rann li pi difisil?","The correct answer is **C: Ekriti (Writing)**.

The passage states: ""menmsi li nan mitan yon fraz. Se yon mwayen enpòtan pou fè distenksyon ant kèk vèb ak objè yo. Li fasilite lekti tou, **kwake ekriti a yon ti jan difisil...**""

This clearly indicates that while capitalization aids readability and distinction between verbs and objects, the act of *writing* with capitalization can be difficult.
"
"Nan pati riral yo nan Malezi, ki jès ki vle di “vini”?","The correct answer is **A: Pliye dwèt endèks la (Folding the index finger)**.

The text explicitly states: ""An Malesi, omwen pami yon Male kap viv nan zon riral yo, sa sinifye **""vini,"" tankou dwet indeks ki pliye nan direksyon kow...**""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki jès ki ta ka vle di “tounen”?","The correct answer is **B: Pliye yon dwèt endèks**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...an Malesi, omwen pami yon Male kap viv nan zon riral yo, sa sinifye """"vini,"""" tankou dwet indeks ki pliye nan direksyon kow...""  ""Cow"" is likely a typo and should be ""kow"" which refers to the direction towards oneself.  Therefore, the gesture that means ""come"" is folding the index finger towards oneself.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki lakoz krevas yo?","The correct answer is **B: Glasye ki enstab**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Glasye yo pa estab, men desamm mòn lan. Sa pwovoke fant kraze yo..."" (Glaciers are unstable, but sliding down the mountain. This provokes cracking, fissures...)  The instability of the glacier *causes* the cracking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pon nèj** (Snow cover): The passage doesn't say snow cover causes the fissures.
* **C: Efondreman gwòt glas yo** (Collapse of large ice blocks):  The passage says large ice blocks *fall* from the glacier, which is a *result* of the instability, not the cause of the fissures.
* **D: Blòk ki lach** (Loose blocks): Similar to C, loose blocks are a *result* of the instability, not the initial cause.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ke pon nèj yo kapab kache?","The correct answer is **B: Gwòt glas (Large ice blocks)**.

The passage states: ""Mi yo ak do gwòt glas yo kapab tonbe epi fele yo kapab refèmen."" which translates to ""Icebergs and large ice blocks can fall and their collapse can be hidden by snow bridges."""
"Selon pasaj la, vwayajè yo ta dwe pran lòt preksyon anvan yo vizite ki lye?","The correct answer is **B: Zòn ki antoure Goma yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Menm si Goma swa ase sekirize, tout vizit ki pa anndan Goma dwe rchèche pou konprann eta konba k ap pèsiste yo nan pwovens Nò Kivu."" This means that while Goma itself is relatively safe, the surrounding areas (Nò Kivu province) have ongoing conflict that visitors need to be aware of and understand.
"
Kilès nan sa yo ki pa t ap yon bon konsèy pou yon touris nan Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: Konba nan North Kivu yo amizan (The fighting in North Kivu is amusing)**.

Here's why:

*   **Option A** is clearly inappropriate and insensitive. The fighting in North Kivu is a serious conflict with devastating consequences for the people living there. It is *not* amusing.
*   **Option B** is a reasonable statement; Goma is a good place to access mountain gorilla tracking.
*   **Option C** is correct; boda-bodas are a common and affordable way to get around Goma.
*   **Option D** is incorrect; the Nyiragongo volcano is *near* Goma, but not *in* the city itself. The eruption in 2002 devastated parts of the city, but the volcano is located outside of the main urban area.

Therefore, the only incorrect and harmful piece of advice is that the conflict is amusing."
Kilè yon pèmi backcountry pou yon jounen depa t ap vin disponib?,"The correct answer is **A: 1ye Janvye**

The text states: ""Donk, yon pèmi antre nan dèyè peyi a pou tout dat kòmanse mwa me a vin disponib 1 janvye."" (So, a backcountry permit for all dates starting in May becomes available on January 1st.)
"
Ki regleman ki an plas pou pwoteje kanyon an?,"The correct answer is **D: Yon kantite pèmi limite**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Pèmi yo limite pou pwoteje canyon an..."" (Permits are limited to protect the canyon...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo sistèm pèmi premye vini premye sèvi:** While ""rive an premye, sèvi an premye"" (first come, first served) is mentioned, it's about *how* permits are distributed, not a regulation for protection.
* **B: Pèmi yo sèlman disponib nan jou 1ye Janvye:**  Permits are available 1 January, but that doesn't mean they are *only* available then.
* **C: Pèmi yo sèlman disponib atravè demann san randevou:** The text mentions ""demann aksè an randevou"" (requests for access via appointment), so permits aren't *only* available through walk-up requests.



"
Kilès nan sa yo ki mwens posib pou yo jwenn nan tip otèl ki dekri nan pasaj la?,"The answer is **D: Chanm ki fèk remanye ki gen amelyorasyon modèn (Newly renovated rooms with modern upgrades)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically describes hotels with ""ansyen apareyaj"" (old appliances) and ""vyevès koutwazi"" (outdated courtesies). This indicates a focus on historical charm and a lack of modern amenities. A newly renovated room with modern upgrades would be the *opposite* of what the passage describes.

Let's look at why the other options are *likely* to be found:

*   **A: Yon ba kòktèl (A cocktail bar):**  The passage mentions ""lavi lannwit"" (nightlife), suggesting the presence of a bar.
*   **B: Yon restoran gastwonomik sou plas (An on-site gourmet restaurant):** The passage mentions ""repa ki fen"" (fine dining), making a gourmet restaurant plausible.
*   **C: Envite yo byen konnen oswa yo ka rekonèt (Well-known or recognizable guests):** The passage states the hotels were frequented by ""moun ki rich yo ak selebrite yo"" (the rich and celebrities).



"
"Dapre enfòmasyon ki prezante nan pasaj la, kilès nan òf sa yo ke envite yo nan otèl la t ap mwens priyorize?","The correct answer is **D: Tarif chanm ki pa chè (Affordable room rates)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that these hotels catered to the wealthy and celebrities.  It highlights fine dining, nightlife, and a sense of old-world charm. The presence of antique furnishings and old-fashioned courtesies reinforces the idea that expense was not a primary concern for the clientele.  

Therefore, affordable room rates would be the *least* prioritized aspect of these hotels. They were catering to a clientele who could afford luxury, not budget accommodations.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa vwayajè yo ta dwe evite lè y ap vizite Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: Trete yon natifnatal Greenland kòm yon “Eskimo”**

The passage explicitly states: ""Menm si mo """"Eskimo"""" toujou akseptab Etazini, li rete pejoratif pou yon pakèt pèp Atik ki pa ameriken, patikilyèman nan Kanada. Menm si ou kapab tande mo itilize pa otochtòn groenlandè yo, itilizasyon li an dwe evite pa etranje yo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sèten zòn yo konnen pou pousantaj krim ki elve** - The passage states that crime and ill will towards foreigners are rare in Greenland.
* **B: Pote gwo rad, paske klima a jeneralman cho pandan tout ane a** - The passage advises bringing warm clothing, especially during the colder months.
* **C: Prevwa pou travay pandan yo lòtbò a, paske koneksyon entènèt la ka pa estab** - The passage states that internet connectivity is good in Greenland.

"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ki plis posib pou kreye pwoblèm pou wvayajè ki pa prepare yo epi k ap vizite Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Tanperati (Temperature)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tan frèt se petèt sèl vrè danje moun ki pa prepare yo pral konfwonte."" (The cold is perhaps the only real danger that unprepared people will face.)
* While the passage mentions mosquitoes and long daylight hours as potential problems, it emphasizes the danger of the cold for unprepared travelers.
* The passage also states that crime and ill will towards foreigners are rare in Greenland.
* The passage explains the correct way to refer to the indigenous people of Greenland.

Therefore, **temperature** is the most likely thing to cause problems for unprepared travelers.
"
Kilès nan sa yo ke yo itilize kounya kòm yon plas santral?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Li fonksyone kounye a menm jan ak plaza santral..."" which translates to ""It functions now just like a central square...""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ki pa disponib nan Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: Yon gazebo santral ak konsè**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that free concerts are held *from the central belvedere* in Jardín de la Unión. It doesn't mention a gazebo.
* The passage mentions restaurants surrounding the garden.
* The passage states that the Temple of San Diego is the only remaining building from the 17th-century convent, indicating the existence of an old convent building.
* The passage clearly mentions the ""Callejon del Beso"" and its associated love story.



Therefore, option A is the only thing *not* explicitly mentioned as being available in Jardín de la Unión.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan deklarasyon sa yo konsènan yon jounen randone ke yo t ap konsidere kòm inegzat?","The incorrect statement is **D: Randone lajounen pa yon aktivite anplennè pou fanmi ki gen tibebe yo.**

Here's why: The passage explicitly states: ""Fanmi ki gen jèn timoun yo kapab gen bezwen pi plis preparasyon, men yon jounen deyò posib byen fasil, menm avèk bebe yo epi timoun ki nan laj preskolè yo."" This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Ti preparasyon nesesè pou randone lajounen yo nan ti wout ki fasil:** The passage states ""yon ti kras preparatif nesesè"" for easy trails.
*   **B: Distans yo varye, men li posib pou fè yo nan lespas yon jou:** The passage says ""distans pou pi piti yon kilomèt jiska distis ki pi long ki kapab franchi nan yon sèl jounen.""
*   **C: Moun ki gen yon nivo fizik modere yo jeneralman anmezi pou renmen aktivite sa a:** The passage states ""tout moun ki an mwayèn an fòm kapab pwofite sa.""



Therefore, the answer is **D**."
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè yon randone lajounen pa mande anpil preparasyon?","The correct answer is **B: Lè sa enplike yon wout ki pi fasil**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pou yon jounen pwomennen sou yon chemen fasil, yon ti kras preparatif nesesè..."" (For a day hike on an easy trail, a little preparation is necessary...). This directly connects easy trails with less preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lè randonè a gen bon sante fizik** - While good physical condition helps, the passage specifically links *easy trails* to less preparation, not just general fitness.
*   **C: Lè timoun yo pral fè yon randone** - The passage says families with young children *might* need more preparation, not that a hike *with* children requires less.
*   **D: Lè randone a fèt nan yon anviwònman ki plis natirèl** - The passage mentions a natural environment as a location for the hike, but it doesn't relate this directly to the amount of preparation needed.



"
Ki diferans ki gen ant plato yo nan Rogaland oswa Agder parapò ak rès Nòvèj la?,"The correct answer is **C: Plato yo jeneralman egal (Plato yo jeneralman inifòm)**.

The text states: ""Plato sa yo souvan rele """"vidde"""" sa ki siyifi yon espas ki louvri, san pyebwa, yon zòn san limit. Plato sa yo jeneralman **inifòm**."" This translates to ""These plateaus are often called """"vidde"""" which means an open space, without trees, a limitless area. These plateaus are generally **uniform**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo genyen pyebwa (They have trees):** The text explicitly says the plateaus are ""san pyebwa"" (without trees).
* **B: Pa genyen fjords (They don't have fjords):** The text says Norway is characterized *by* fjords.
* **D: Yo souvan kouvri ak briyè (They are often covered with glitter):** The text doesn't mention anything about glitter."
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan aktivite sa yo ki pa t ap jeneral pou Nòvèj?","The correct answer is **C: Fjords ki gen koub (Curved fjords)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly describes Norway as characterized by ""divès fyòd apik ak vale"" (various peaked fjords and valleys). This means fjords are a defining feature.
* The passage mentions ""plato ki wo, plizoumwen inifòm"" (high, more or less uniform plateaus).
* The passage describes these plateaus as ""vidde"" – open, treeless spaces.
* The passage states that in Rogaland and Agder, these plateaus are called ""hei,"" meaning treeless land covered with heather.
* **The passage does *not* mention anything about curved fjords.** It only refers to ""peaked fjords.""

Therefore, curved fjords are not mentioned as a characteristic of Norway according to the provided text.
"
Kilès touris ki enterese nan ski yo ta dwe vizite pòs montay yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Pandan ivè**.

The text explicitly states that many mountain resorts receive a good amount of snow in winter and offer activities like skiing and snowboarding. Therefore, tourists interested in skiing should visit during the winter.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè an jeneralman ki gen plis touris nan pòs montay yo?","The correct answer is **C: Pandan ete Endyen**.

The passage states: ""Sezon touristik estasyon mòn kilmin yo jeneralman pandan ete endyen an."" which translates to ""The tourist season for mountain peak stations is generally during the Indian summer.""
"
Kisa ou ta dwe evite fè si ou espere jwenn yon bato k ap chèche èd?,"The correct answer is **A: Monte ak desann kè pon yo (Getting discouraged)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of actively engaging with the marina community, sharing information, and being helpful.  Getting discouraged would be counterproductive to this goal. The text suggests that by being proactive and friendly, you'll eventually be known and people will offer assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Kreye lyen amitye ak kaptèn yo (Building friendships with captains):**  The passage *encourages* building relationships with people in the marina.
* **C: Fè piblisite pou sèvis ou yo (Advertising your services):** The passage suggests making yourself known, but not necessarily advertising your services directly.  It's more about being available and helpful.
* **D: Inyore moun k ap mande woulib sou lòt bato (Ignoring people asking for help with other boats):** The passage implies being helpful and connecting with others, so ignoring someone in need would be the opposite of what it advises.



"
Kisa ou ta dwe fè bò marina yo lè w ap chèche yon bato ki bezwen èd?,"The correct answer is **A: Kontakte maren yo (Contact the sailors)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that you should try to make contact with as many people as possible, including sailors.
* Option A aligns directly with this advice.
* The other options are not as helpful or aligned with the passage:
    * B: Rete nan rada a (Stay in the anchorage) - This doesn't actively seek out help.
    * C: Sèlman apwoche moun pandan y ap netwaye yatch yo (Only approach people while they are cleaning yachts) - This is too narrow of a strategy.
    * D: Evite swiv moun k ap mande woulib yo (Avoid following people asking for lines) - This is irrelevant to finding a boat needing help.



"
Ki lye ki t ap fè plezi a yon touris ki enterese nan istwa kolonyal zile a?,"The correct answer is **A: Riv nò a**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Si w ap chèche prèv pase kolonyal teritwa a, se yon bon kote pou kòmanse."" (If you are looking for evidence of the colonial territory, this is a good place to start.)  It then specifies that the majority of colonial development is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the **northern coast** of Hong Kong Island. 

Therefore, the northern coast is the place where a tourist interested in colonial history would find the most evidence.
"
Ki lye ki t ap atire yon touris ki priyorize vi ki bèl anpil yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Hong Kong limenm**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lil Hong Kong bay non li a teritwa Hong Kong epi se kote anpil touris konsidere tankou se la menm sant entere yo ye."" (Victoria Harbour is known as the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider to be the same center of their interests.)

While the passage mentions Victoria Harbour and the reclaimed land in Hong Kong Island, it emphasizes that Hong Kong *itself* is a major attraction for tourists seeking beautiful views.
"
Kisa kèk sèl genyen ki ede limite risk pou pye yon kavalye kole nan yon etriye?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba sekirite**.

The passage explicitly states: ""kèk sèl tankou sèl anglè yo gen ba sekirite ki pèmèt yon kavalye tonbe sou sèl la si yon kavalye k ap tonbe rale l dèyè."" This means low security is a feature designed to *limit* the risk of a rider getting trapped.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Semèl ki etwa** - ""Semèl ki etwa"" doesn't have a meaning and isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Etriye an kui** - The text describes the stirrups themselves as a potential hazard, not a feature that limits the risk.
* **D: Pi gran estabilite** - While stirrups *do* offer stability, the passage highlights the *risk* associated with that stability.  Greater stability doesn't inherently limit the risk of being trapped.



"
Ki fonksyon nan yon bòt ekitasyon ki ede ogmante sekirite moun nan lè l ap itilize yon etriye?,"The correct answer is **C: Yon talon (A heel)**.

Here's why:

* **Heels prevent the foot from slipping through the stirrup.** The passage specifically states that most riders wear boots with heels and a closed-toe sole to prevent this. The heel acts as a barrier, holding the foot securely in place within the stirrup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yon semèl ki di, ki etwa (A flat sole, approximately):**  Flat soles offer very little security in stirrups and are considered unsafe. The passage implies the opposite - closed-toe soles are better.
* **B: Kui (A curb):** A curb is part of the bridle and doesn't directly relate to the rider's security in the stirrups.
* **D: Yon semèl laj (A wide sole):** While a wider sole might offer *some* stability, it's not the primary safety feature that prevents the foot from slipping through the stirrup like a heel does.



Therefore, the answer is **C: Yon talon**."
Kisa yo ofri vwayajè yo atravè rezo echanj ospitalite yo?,"The correct answer is **A: Aranjman avèk ebèjè lokal yo**.

The text states: ""Yon rezon echanj dakèy se yon òganizasyon ki konekte vwayajè yo ak habitan vil yo gen pou vizite yo."" This directly translates to ""Couchsurfing is an organization that connects travelers with city dwellers who have them to visit.""  The key offering is the connection to local hosts for accommodation. While the text mentions Casey Fenton finding a cheap flight, that's his personal experience and not what the organization *offers* travelers.  The other options are not supported by the text.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan deklarasyon sa yo konsènan rezo echanj ospitalite a ki pa laverite?","The incorrect statement is **A: Vwayajè yo toujou resevwa referans pou ebèjè lokal yo** (Travelers always receive references for local hosts).

Here's why:

* The passage states that some welcoming networks *sometimes* include references or feedback from other travelers. It doesn't say travelers *always* receive them.
* The passage explicitly mentions that Couchsurfing sometimes includes references/feedback.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Kèk rezo kapab mande lòt verifikasyon pou vwayajè yo** (Some networks may require additional verification for travelers) - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **C: Vwayajè yo pral resevwa yon lis ebèjè ki disponib nan vil destinasyon an** (Travelers will receive a list of available hosts in the destination city) - The passage mentions a list of available spaces, either printed or online.
* **D: Kòmantè sou ebèjè lokal yo pafwa disponib pou vwayajè yo** (Comments about local hosts are sometimes available for travelers) - This is explicitly mentioned as happening on Couchsurfing.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that is not supported by the passage.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki tip envite yo gen mwens chans pou jwenn nan yon chanm otèl pataje?","The correct answer is **C: Yon envite k ap vwayaje ak timoun piti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fanmi ki gen timoun yo pa anpil..."". This implies that families with young children have limited options, and therefore are less likely to find a room in a shared room situation. The passage also mentions the hotel primarily serves ""jen moun yo"" (young people), suggesting they are not the primary target for families with young children.
"
"Selon pasaj la, kilès ki gen plis chans pou pase sejou nan yon obèj?","The correct answer is **C: Yon koup ki nan 70 lane yo (A couple in their 70s)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the inn caters ""sitou bay jen moun yo"" (primarily serves young people).
* It also mentions difficulty finding a room for older guests.
* The passage then notes that families with children are rare, but there are some authorized pensions with private rooms.

This suggests that while the inn *can* accommodate older people, it's not their primary clientele, and it's difficult to find suitable lodging for them. Option C, a couple in their 70s, fits this description best.  The other options are less likely based on the provided text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki pi byen dekri lansman boomerang?","The best answer is **A: L ap toujou retounen nan men w si ou byen voye l (It always returns to you if you throw it properly).**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the *goal* of throwing a boomerang is for it to return to the thrower.  While it also mentions the difficulty for beginners, the core concept is the returning flight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Li plis popilè pami lokal yo pase touris yo (It is more popular among locals than tourists):** The passage states it's a *popular skill* for tourists, not that it's more popular with locals.
* **C: Pa genyen anpil boomerangs ki disponib an Ostrali (There aren't many boomerangs available in Australia):** The passage actually says the *best* boomerangs are expensive and that the cost makes it less accessible to beginners.
* **D: Sèlman kèk boomerangs ki rive retounen (Only a few boomerangs return):** The passage implies that *proper* throwing is key to a returning boomerang, not that only a few return.



"
Kilès nan sa yo ki itilize plis nan kizin Javanè?,"The correct answer is **C: Sik kokoye**.

The text explicitly states that a dominant flavor in Javanese cuisine is ""sik kokoye javanè a"" which translates to ""Javanese coconut sugar"". Therefore, coconut sugar is used most in Javanese cuisine according to the passage.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kijan yon maladi kontajye pwopaje?","The correct answer is **A: Moun ki enfekte**.

The passage states: ""Yon maladi ki kontajye se yon maladi ki transmèt fasilman lè ou bò kote yon moun ki enfekte..."" which translates to ""A contagious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted from person to person..."".  While pathogens are *involved*, the passage explicitly says it spreads *from an infected person*.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa yo konnen ki se koz yon maladi kontajye?","The correct answer is **B: Viris yo**.

The passage states: ""Yon maladi enfektyez se yon maladi ki koze pa yon ajan patojèn, tankou viris, bakteri, chanpiyon oubyen lòt parazit.""  This means infectious diseases are caused by pathogens like viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites.  The question asks for the cause of a *contagious* disease. While the passage doesn't explicitly state that viruses *cause* contagious diseases, it *does* list viruses as one of the causes of infectious diseases.  Since contagious diseases are a subset of infectious diseases, and the passage mentions viruses as a cause of infectious diseases, it's the most accurate answer among the choices. The other options (vaccines, bacteria, and fungi) are not the direct cause of contagious diseases according to the text."
Nan ki senaryo chwa yon pwoksi wèb t ap plis sifizan pou itilizatè a pase chwa yon founisè VPN pèsonèl?,"The correct answer is **C: Itilizatè a ap prensipalman reyoryante trafik http yo**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states that VPNs are superior when bypassing restrictions because they handle all internet traffic, not just HTTP.**
* **Proxies, on the other hand, are most suitable when *only* HTTP traffic needs to be routed through them.** They don't encrypt traffic in the same way a VPN does.
* **Options A and B are incorrect** because they describe situations where a VPN would be *more* suitable.
* **Option D** mentions bandwidth, which is a factor, but the core distinction between VPNs and proxies lies in *all* traffic vs. *specific* traffic (HTTP).

Therefore, if an user only needs to bypass restrictions for HTTP traffic, a web proxy would be sufficient.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo konsènan VPN ak pwoksi wèb ki pa laverite?","The correct answer is **D: VPN yo ka sèlman reyoryante trafik http yo (VPNs can only forward HTTP traffic)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""VPNs orient **all** internet traffic, not just HTTP."" This directly contradicts option D.
* **Option A is true:** The passage states VPNs ""typically enjoy a wider bandwidth.""
* **Option B is true:** The passage says VPNs are superior to web proxies *because* they forward all traffic, unlike proxies.
* **Option C is true:** The passage states VPNs offer better quality of service.

Therefore, option D is the only incorrect statement based on the provided text."
Kisa ki pèmèt yon moun itilize yon konpayi telefòn andeyò zòn imedya yo a?,"The correct answer is **B: Nimewo telefòn mondyal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kòm apèl yo pase pa entènèt, ou pa bezwen itilize yon konpayi telefòn kote ou te rete a oubyen kote wap vwayaje a...ou kapab gen yon koneksyon entènèt pa satelit nan rejyon sovaj Chicken lan, an Alaska, ak seleksyone yon nimewo ki prann ou nan Arizone ki gen solèy."" This highlights that using an internet-based calling service (VoIP) allows you to use a number in a different location than where you're physically located.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Souvan, ou dwe achte separeman yon nimewo global ki pèmèt ak telefòn RTC yo rele w."" This directly points to the need for a global phone number to receive calls.
* **Option A (Apèl ki fèt sou entènèt):** While internet calling is the *method*, it doesn't inherently allow you to use a phone company outside your immediate area.
* **Option C (Satelit yo):** Satellites are a *means of connection*, but they don't directly enable using a phone company in a different location.
* **Option D (Telefòn PSTN yo):** PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is the traditional phone network and doesn't fit the scenario described, which involves internet-based calling and global numbers.



Therefore, a global phone number is what permits using a phone company outside of your immediate location."
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki ta ka bezwen fèt pou kapab resevwa sèten apèl?","The correct answer is **A: Achte yon nimewo mondyal (Buy a global number)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Souvan, ou dwe achte separeman yon nimewo global ki pèmèt ak telefòn RTC yo rele w."" (Often, you must separately purchase a global number that allows RTC phones to call you.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Itilize yon konpayi telefòn lokal (Use a local phone company):** The passage says you *don't* need to use a local phone company.
*   **C: Jwenn yon nimewo nan kominote lokal ou an (Get a number in your local community):**  The passage says a local community number isn't necessary.
*   **D: Achte yon telefòn PSTN (Buy a PSTN phone):**  The passage doesn't mention PSTN phones. It focuses on global numbers and RTC phones.



"
Kiyès nan enonse sa yo ki pa byen dekri pwononsiyasyon mo Italyen yo byen?,"The correct answer is **A: Yon doub r pwononse diferan pase yon sèl r**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""asire ou ke ou pwononse r ak rr fason diferan: caro vle di chè pandan carro vle di charyo."" This directly contradicts option A, which claims the double 'r' is *not* pronounced differently. The text *does* say it's pronounced differently.

The other options are accurate descriptions from the text:

* **B: Pifò mo yo pwononse fason yo ekri a:** The text states this is generally true.
* **C: Mo ki gen lèt c ak g ka difisil:** The text correctly identifies 'c' and 'g' as letters with variable pronunciations.
* **D: Pwononsiyasyon pifò mo yo varye selon vwayèl ki swiv la:** The text clearly states this is true (""pwononsiyasyon yo varye an fonksyon vwayèl swivan an"").



"
Kilès nan karakteristik Izmir sa yo ki gen orijin yo anvan tan modèn nan?,"The correct answer is **D: Twati an twil wouj (Red-tiled roofs)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions ""twati tradisyonèl wouj-twil"" as being part of the city's historical character, connecting it to the 18th-century market and older mosques and churches.  The other options are described as modern or developments of the city:

*   **Gran boulva (Wide boulevards):** These are described as modern.
*   **Batiman ki gen fasad an vit (Buildings with glass facades):**  These are explicitly described as modern.
*   **Sant acha (Shopping center):** This refers to modern commercial activity.



"
Kilès nan sa yo ki pa yon karakteristik egzat pou Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Atmosfè a reflete Latiki tradisyonèl**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""menmsi vil la gen yon atmosfè plis nan Ewòp Mediterane pase tradisyonèl Latiki."" (although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkish.)

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate based on the passage:

* **A: Vil la antoure yon gran bè:** The passage states Izmir is ""enstale ozalantou yon gwo bè"" (located around a large bay).
* **C: Ou ka jwenn alafwa sant acha modèn ak ansyen legliz:** The passage mentions ""sant magazen modèn yo chaje ak twati tradisyonèl wouj-twil, mache a 18tyèm syèk, ak moske fin vye ak legliz"" (modern shopping centers filled with traditional red-tiled houses, an 18th-century bazaar, and old mosques and churches).
* **D: Li genyen dezyèm pi gran pò nan Latiki:** The passage clearly says: ""dezyèm pi gwo pò aprè Istanboul e yon trè bon sant transpò"" (the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub).



"
Mo anami fè referans ak pwendvi ki?,"The correct answer is **A: Flè serizye**.

The passage states: ""Obsèvasyon flè seriz yo, yo konnen yo sou non anami..."" which translates to ""Observations of cherry blossoms, they are known by the name anami...""  Therefore, ""anami"" refers to cherry blossoms.
"
Kilès ki te òganize premye fèt ki te dedye ak obsèvasyon flè serizye yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Anperè japonè**.

The passage states: ""Japon, se Amprè a ki te òganize premye fèt florezon cerizye a..."". This translates to ""Japan, it was the Emperor who organized the first cherry blossom festival...""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan aspè sa yo nan Jerizalèm ki gen mwens chans pou atire touris?","The answer is **B: Estati li antanke vil kapital Izrayèl**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while Jerusalem *is* considered the capital by many Israelis, most other countries and the UN do not recognize it as such.  Therefore, its status as capital is a point of contention and likely *less* attractive to tourists than its religious significance, cultural offerings, and historical sites.  The other options are all explicitly mentioned as tourist attractions.
"
Kilès ki nan sa yo ki pa mansyone nan pasaj la kòm yon bagay yo konnen Jerizalèm pou li?,"The correct answer is **B: Enfliyans politik**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions Jerusalem's fascinating history, religious importance, and cultural sites.
* While the passage acknowledges the political status of Jerusalem (being the claimed capital of Israel but not widely recognized), it doesn't elaborate on its *influence* in the political sphere.  It simply states the differing recognition.

Therefore, ""Influence politique"" (political influence) is the element not mentioned in the passage.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki tip vwayajè ki pa t ap benefisye de acha yon Kat Wild?","The correct answer is **B: Yon vwayajè k ap vizite sèlman Kruger National Park**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a Wild Card is advantageous for those who want access to ""divès pak nan Afrik di Sid oubyen a tout pak nasyonal Afrik di Sid yo"" (various parks in South Africa or all national parks of South Africa).  If someone is *only* visiting Kruger, they wouldn't benefit from a Wild Card, as it offers access to other parks they won't be visiting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yon vwayajè k ap planifye pou vizite otan SANParks posib** - This *would* benefit from a Wild Card.
*   **C: Yon vwayajè ki sou bidjè epi ki enkyete l de pri pak la** - A Wild Card might actually save money in the long run if they plan to visit multiple parks.
*   **D: Yon vwayajè k ap planifye pou vizite Kruger National Park epi omwen yon lòt pak** - This *would* benefit from a Wild Card.



"
Ki deklarasyon ki pa byen dekri Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Se Pak Nasyonal ki Pi Piti nan Afrik Disid (It is the smallest National Park in South Africa)**.

The passage states the opposite - Kruger National Park covers 19,500 km² and is a major attraction. Options A, B, and D are all accurate statements based on the text.
"
Kilès nan sa yo ki gen plis chans pou lakoz danje pou alpinis yo pandan tout pati ki pi rèd yo nan montay la?,"The correct answer is **A: Kondisyon ki mouye (Wet conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Atann ou pou w esoufle e fe atansyon nan kote ki pi red yo, sitou le yo mouye, sa ki vin danje."" (Expect to catch your breath and be careful of the steeper sections, especially when they are wet, which become dangerous.)

While the other options present challenges, the passage directly links wet conditions to increased danger on the steepest parts of the mountain.  

* **Mach an wòch (Rocky steps)** are a feature of the trail, but not inherently dangerous *unless* wet.
* **Ti gwòt toupiti (Small tunnel)** is mentioned as being narrow and tight, but it's a single obstacle, not a consistent danger on the steeper parts.
* **Kab ann asye (Steel supports)** are there for stability, not a source of danger.



"
Kilès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki pa byen reflete monte nan montay Machu Picchu ki dekri nan pasaj la?,"The correct answer is **A: Menm aplinis ki gen bon fizik yo pral pèdi souf yo (Even athletes with good fitness will lose their breath)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that most fit people can complete the climb in about 45 minutes, but it also mentions being winded and needing to watch out for the steeper sections.** This implies that even fit individuals will experience shortness of breath, but it doesn't suggest that even athletes will *always* lose their breath.
* **B: Pa genyen okenn ranp pou men nan tout pati ki pi rèd yo (There are no handrails on all the steepest sections)** - The passage explicitly mentions steel cables for support, implying something akin to handrails in some areas.
* **C: Ou dwe travèse yon gwòt nan anwo a (You must cross a crevice at the top)** - The passage clearly states there's a small, narrow crevice to cross near the summit.
* **D: Pati pi rèd yo ka vin danjre lè yo mouye (The steeper sections can become dangerous when wet)** - The passage warns specifically about the danger of the steeper sections when wet.



Therefore, option A is the one that *doesn't* accurately reflect the information provided in the passage."
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ki pa yon aliman debaz nan kizin Majòkèn nan?","The correct answer is **C: Grenn**.

The text explicitly states that the cuisine is based on **bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork)** and that olive oil is used everywhere.  Grains are not mentioned as a staple.
"
"Dapre enfòmasyon ki nan pasaj la, ki deklare sou repa hangi yo ki pa laverite?","The incorrect statement is **B: Hangi itilize wòch cho ki disponib nan Wellington.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that while some hangi are available in Wellington, geothermal hangi are specifically offered in Rotorua. It doesn't say that *all* hangi use rocks from Wellington. 
* The other statements are all directly supported by the passage.



Therefore, the answer is **B**."
Kilès nan sa yo ki pa mansyone kòm yon fason jeneral pou chofe fòs hangi a?,"The correct answer is **A: Gaz**.

The passage specifically mentions rocks from fires and geothermal heat as ways to heat a hangi. Gas is not mentioned.
"
Kisa ki ta ka lakoz rekonesans espesyal yon mwàn oswa yon relijyez?,"The correct answer is **B: Kouvri zepòl ou** (Cover your shoulders).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that women must cover their shoulders when visiting temples. It also mentions that men should wear pants to cover their legs.  The key point is covering the shoulders as a sign of respect and adherence to the temple's dress code.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mete yon chal ki gen gwo koulè** (Wear a brightly colored shawl): While wearing a shawl might be part of the dress code, the text doesn't highlight a bright color as *special* or a sign of recognition.
*   **C: Prete yon chal nan monastè a** (Lend a shawl to the monastery):  Lending a shawl isn't mentioned as a way to gain special recognition.
*   **D: Mete yon jip ki koupe sou jenou** (Wear a knee-length skirt): While knee-length skirts are allowed for women, the text emphasizes covering the knees and shoulders."
Kilès nan rad sa yo ki pa twò posib pou disponib pou prete nan yon monastè? ,"The correct answer is **A: Jip**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pandan vizit monastè yo, fanm yo oblije mete jip ki kouvri jenou yo epi gen zepòl yo ki kouvri tou. Pi fò monastè bay anvlòp ak fanm ki pa prepare yo...""  This indicates that skirts are provided for women.

The text also says, ""...Ou kapab tou prete jip sa yo nan estòk nan antre a..."". This confirms skirts are available to borrow.

The text implies pants are expected for men.  The other options, ""Bout pantalon"" (pants bottoms) and ""Chal"" (shawl), are not mentioned in the context of being provided or borrowed at a monastery.
"
Kilè yon vizitè ta dwe gen plis opòtinite pou gade zetwal yo pandan y ap vizite zòn Antaktik yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Lè zòn nan pa twò gen anpil moun**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""Kòm zòn yo pa gen anpil moun epi polisyon limyè a pa toutan yon pwoblèm, wap kapab pwofite de etwal yo tou."" This translates to ""Because the areas are not very populated and light pollution is not always a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.""  The key factor for stargazing is low light pollution, which is directly related to the number of people present.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pandan mwa ete yo (During the summer months):** The passage specifically mentions that the polar night (when the sun doesn't rise) provides an opportunity to see the Northern Lights *because* the sky is dark. Summer is the opposite - it would be bright.
* **C: Pandan mwa ivè yo (During the winter months):**  While winter is when polar night occurs, the passage doesn't say that winter is the *best* time for stargazing, only that it's a good time for the Northern Lights.
* **D: Lè nivo polisyon limyè a fèb (When light pollution is low):** While low light pollution is *necessary* for stargazing, the passage says that you can enjoy the stars *because* the areas are not crowded.  Low light pollution is mentioned as a *consequence* of less crowding.



"
Kilè yon telefòn satelit pa t ap yon ranplasman ki fezab pou yon telefòn pòtab?,"The correct answer is **A: Si liy ki vize satelit la kapab bouche (If the line of sight to the satellite can be blocked)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a satellite phone requires a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a call. If something blocks that line of sight (like a building, a mountain, or dense foliage), the phone won't work.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Si lye a twò lwen (If the location is too remote):** While remote locations are where satellite phones are *needed*, remoteness itself doesn't inherently make a satellite phone *unsuitable*. It's the lack of cellular infrastructure in remote locations that makes satellite phones a valuable option.
* **C: Si li pral itilize anplennè (If it will be used extensively):** The frequency of use doesn't determine if a satellite phone is a viable replacement for a cell phone.
* **D: Si yon ekspedisyon mande sèten bezwen pou done (If an expedition requires specific data needs):** This is a situation where satellite phones are *useful*, but it doesn't make them a replacement for a regular cell phone. It's a specific use case, not a general reason why they aren't a replacement.



"
Kilè yon telefòn satelit t ap pi bon pase yon telefòn pòtab?,"The correct answer is **B: Pandan yon trajè nan bato**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Yon telefòn satelit itilize souvan pa navigasyon an, epi menm bato plezans yo..."" This directly links satellite phones to situations where cellular service is unavailable.
* **Options A, C, and D are incorrect** because they describe situations where a regular cell phone would likely be sufficient.  A vacation in a city (A) usually has good cell service.  If remote data isn't needed (C), a cell phone is fine.  If you have good cell coverage (D), a satellite phone isn't necessary.

Therefore, a journey on a boat is the scenario where a satellite phone is *most* advantageous because it's likely far from cell towers.
"
Konfli nan kilès nan sa yo ki te mennen kreyasyon repiblik Transnistriya a?,"The correct answer is **B: Etnisite**.

The passage explicitly states that Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic and has suffered from ethnic conflicts. The creation of Transnistria in 1994 was a direct result of these ethnic conflicts. While economic factors and language differences might have played a role, the core driver was the ethnic tensions between different groups within Moldova.

The passage doesn't mention the church or religion as the primary cause of the conflict that led to the creation of Transnistria.
"
Kilès nan sa yo ke Repiblik Transnistriya genyen ki diferan de rès Mòldova a?  ,"The correct answer is **C: Rekonesans UN (UN Recognition)**.

Here's why:

* **A: Lang (Language):** While Romanian is the official language of Moldova, Russian is widely spoken in Transnistria. However, Romanian isn't *necessarily* different from the rest of Moldova.
* **B: Relijyon (Religion):** While the Orthodox Church is the largest religion in Moldova, there's no explicit statement that Transnistria has a *different* religion.
* **C: Rekonesans UN (UN Recognition):** The passage explicitly states that Transnistria is *not* recognized by any UN member state. This is a key difference.
* **D: Deviz (Currency):** The passage mentions that Transnistria has its own currency, which is a difference from Moldova, but UN recognition is a more fundamental distinguishing factor.

Therefore, the lack of UN recognition is the most significant difference mentioned in the text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè yon vwayajè ta dwe vizite Montevideo si li espere evite kondisyon van yo?","The correct answer is **D: Pandan mwa ivè Montevideo yo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ivè a kapab frèt anpil: tanperati yo pa souvan desann nan zewo, men van ak imidite a konbine pou bay enpresyon li fè plis frèt pase sa tèmomèt la di."" This indicates that the wind and humidity are the main factors contributing to the feeling of cold during Montevideo's winter. Therefore, to avoid the strong wind conditions, a traveler should visit during Montevideo's winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pandan mwa ivè nan Emisfè Nò yo:** This is irrelevant to the wind conditions in Montevideo.
*   **B: Pandan sezon sechrès Montevideo yo:** The passage says there isn't a distinct dry season.
*   **C: Pandan mwa ete nan Emisfè Nò yo:** This is also irrelevant."
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè yon vwayajè ta dwe vizite Montevideo si li plis renmen yon klima ki pi fre?","The correct answer is **D: Lè se ivè nan Emisfè Nò a**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tankou Montevideyo twouve l nan sid Ekwatè, se ete kounya kote se ivè nan emisfè nò epi vice versa."" This means when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo.  Therefore, a traveler who prefers a cooler climate should visit Montevideo when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ki t ap asosye ak yon atis grafiti ki etabli, kontrèman ak vandalis?","The correct answer is **A: Evènman grafiti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Antouka, nan jou kounya yo genyen grafe yo ki etabli evenman grafiti yo epi """"sou mi legal yo""""."" This translates to ""Anyway, nowadays there are graffitis that organize graffiti events and 'on the borderline'."" This directly indicates that organized graffiti events are distinct from vandalism and are presented as somewhat legitimate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Grifonaj (Scrawling):** The passage calls it ""miral yo oswa gribouyaj initil yo"" (murals or useless scribbles), which implies a less organized and often negative association with scribbling.
* **C: Penti miray endezirab nan pwopriyete piblik (Undesirable wall paintings on public property):** This describes vandalism, the very thing the passage contrasts with.
* **D: Etikèt ki pa lizib (Unreadable tags):**  This is a characteristic of some graffiti but doesn't represent a larger, organized entity.



"
Ki aspè nan festival mizik la ke kèk patisipan panse ki se yon pati esansyèl nan eksperyans lan?,"The correct answer is **B: Fè kan sou sit la**.

The first sentence of the text states: ""Pou kèk festival, majorite patisipan nan festival mizik yo deside rete sou plas, epi majorite patisipan yo konsidere sa tankou yon pati esansyèl nan eksperyans lan."" This directly translates to ""For some festivals, the majority of music festival participants decide to stay on site, and the majority of participants consider this an essential part of the experience.""

While options C (Jwe mizik ta lannwit) is mentioned, it's presented as a consequence of the main event ending, not the essential part. Option A (Mennen jèn timoun yo) is only mentioned as a feature of *some* festivals. Option D (Vini bonè) isn't mentioned at all. Therefore, option B is the only one that accurately reflects the text's main point about an essential part of the festival experience.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa yon patisipan nan festival la ta dwe priyorize si li vle fè kan tou pre mizik la?","The correct answer is **C: Kan deyò sit la**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""If you want to be close to the action, you will need to have a campsite close to the music.""  This implies camping *outside* the main area where the music is played. Options A, B, and D are not directly supported by the text. The text doesn't mention going out at night, specifically choosing a family camping zone, or arriving early as a priority to be close to the music.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki kote vizitè yo ta dwe evite lè y ap chèche lavi lannwit nan nò Nouvo Meksik?","The correct answer is **B: Ba nan ti vil yo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Attention: ba ki nan ti vil yo isi a pa toujou yon bon kote pou vizitè ki soti nan lòt kote."" (Attention: bars in these small towns are not always a good place for visitors from elsewhere.)  The passage also mentions problems with drunk driving in these small towns.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki kote li plis posib pou yon vizitè jwenn divètisman tout moun byen konnen nan nò Nouvo Meksik?","The correct answer is **C: Nan yon kazino tou pre Sante Fe**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Albuquerque and Santa Fe are the places where you can find a significant nightlife.
* It also says that nearly all casinos listed provide drinks and entertainment.
* Option C specifically mentions a casino near Santa Fe, which aligns with the information in the passage.
* The passage warns against visiting smaller towns due to driving problems and impaired drivers.
* Options A and D are incorrect because they don't mention Santa Fe or directly relate to the information provided. Option B, ""Nan yon katye lwen"" (In a faraway district), is not mentioned in the text.



"
Kip tip bwason ke vwayajè ki sousye de bidjè yo ta dwe evite?,"The correct answer is **D: Ji fwi**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ji fwi yo chè men yo bon."" (Fruit juices are expensive but good). 
* The question asks which drinks a budget-conscious traveler should *avoid*. Expensive items are generally avoided on a budget.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Diven Ostralyen** - The passage suggests New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for travel, implying they are *not* necessarily expensive.
* **B: Dlo nan boutèy** - The passage says bottled water is *easily* available if you're worried about tap water, implying it's not prohibitively expensive.
* **C: Byè lokal** - The passage describes the local beer as ""agreeable and refreshing,"" suggesting it's likely affordable.



"
"Selon zòn ki dekri nan pasaj la, kilès nan kòmann bwason sa yo yon sèvè kapab plis nan konfizyon sou li?","The correct answer is **D: Yon flat white**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""For Australians, the idea of a ‘flat white’ coffee is foreign."" This indicates that a server in the described location (presumably not Australia) would likely be unfamiliar with the drink and could be confused by the order.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Yon short black:** The passage explains what an ""espresso"" is, and a ""short black"" is essentially the same thing.
*   **B: Yon Number One:** The passage describes ""Number One"" as a local beer, implying a server there would know it.
*   **C: Yon Sauvignon Blanc ki soti Nouvèl Zelann:** The passage suggests New Zealand and Australian wines are good for travel. A server would likely be familiar with Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.



"
Se ki gwoup ki te kòmanse peryòd kolonizasyon ki te dire twa syèk yo?,"The correct answer is **D: The Spaniards**.

The passage states: ""Espanyòl yo te kòmanse peryòd kolonizasyon an ki te dire twa syèk."" (The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.)
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki pi bon fason ki genyen pou fè yon Parizyen renmen w?","The correct answer is **C: Aji ak politès (Act with politeness)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""pi bon fason pou tande nan Pari se rete pou konpòte w pi bon nan fòm li an, konpòte w tankou yon moun 'bien élevé' (byen elve).""  ""Bien élevé"" translates to well-mannered, polite, or refined.  The passage also mentions that being polite will ""fasilite yon mannyè konsiderab deplasman ou yo"" (facilitate a considerable ease in your movements/interactions).

Therefore, acting with politeness is the best way to gain favor with Parisians according to the text.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eseye estimile atitid Parizyen an (Try to stimulate the Parisian attitude):** The passage doesn't mention stimulating any particular attitude.
* **B: Eksprime konfyans (Express confidence):** While confidence might be helpful, the text focuses on politeness, not confidence.
* **D: Montre konpòtman ekstravèti (Show extroverted behavior):** The text doesn't discuss extroversion at all; it emphasizes refined and well-mannered behavior.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ke yo pa konsidere kòm yon kalite estereyotip pou Parizyen yo?","The correct answer is **A: Awogans**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Parisians are often perceived as ""brutal."" It then suggests that being polite will help navigate interactions. This implies that ""brutalite"" is a common stereotype.
* The passage *doesn't* mention arrogance, boastfulness, or rudeness as common stereotypes. While these *could* be stereotypes, they aren't directly addressed in the text as being prevalent perceptions of Parisians.

Therefore, arrogance is the least directly addressed and, thus, the least likely to be considered a common stereotype *according to this passage*.
"
Ki avantaj Premye Klas genyen sou MetroRail nan Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: Pa twò gen anpil moun (Less crowded)**.

Here's why:

* The text states ""MetroPlus se pi konfòtab ak mwens moun..."" which translates to ""MetroPlus is more comfortable and has fewer people..."".
* Option A is incorrect because both MetroPlus and Metro trains have MetroPlus carriages at the front.
* Option C is incorrect because MetroPlus is *slightly* more expensive than standard fares, not cheaper.
* Option D is incorrect; MetroPlus is not the same price as a Metwo ticket.

Therefore, the primary advantage of MetroPlus (Premye Klas) mentioned in the text is that it's less crowded.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa chak tren vwayajè nan Cape Town genyen?","The correct answer is **D: Vagon Premye ak Twazyèm klas**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that MetroPlus (Premye Gwoup) and Metro (Twazyèm Gwoup) are the two classes of trains.
* It also clarifies that MetroPlus trains are more comfortable and have fewer passengers, but are slightly more expensive.
* The fact that MetroPlus trains are at the front of the train closest to Cape Town suggests a division within the train.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yon vagon Metwo ki mwens peple:** While MetroPlus has fewer passengers, this isn't *exclusive* to them.
* **B: Menm pri tikè pou tou de klas yo:** The passage states MetroPlus is slightly more expensive.
* **C: Twa klas diferan:** The passage only mentions two classes: MetroPlus and Metro.



"
Kilès nan sa yo yon bèt domestik gen mwens chans pou fè?,"The correct answer is **D: Lakoz gwo domaj**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on pests and dangerous animals.** Pests are often parasites that damage food, cause irritation, or allergic reactions. Dangerous animals can kill or injure.
* **Domestic animals are generally kept to prevent them from causing harm.** While they *can* cause some irritation (like from a scratch), allergic reactions, or even transmit infections, they are *less likely* to cause major damage compared to wild, dangerous animals or parasites. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Lakoz yon gratèl (Cause a scratch):** Domestic animals *can* cause scratches.
* **B: Irite alèji (Cause allergies):** Domestic animals *can* trigger allergies.
* **C: Gaye yon enfeksyon (Spread an infection):** Domestic animals *can* spread infections (though it's often managed through vaccinations and care).



"
Kilè yo ka achte kat telefòn prepeye yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Nan magazen ki nan zòn nan**.

The text states the phone cards are available in a corner store.  Option C, ""Nan magazen ki nan zòn nan"" (In stores in the area), is the closest match. Options A and B are too specific and not mentioned. Option D is incorrect as you buy the cards *at* stores, not *on* pay phones.
"
Kijan pou jwenn aksè nan pi bon tarif pou apèl ke kèk kat ofri?,"The best answer is **B: Atravè nimewo gratis yo**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""Akses ak sèvis sa yo fèt souvan ak yon nimewo telefòn gratis ou ka rele ak pifò telefòn san peye."" (Access and services are often done with a free phone number you can call and most prepaid phones.)

This directly links accessing the special tariffs to using the free phone number. Options A, C, and D are either incorrect based on the prompt or not the primary way to access the specific tariffs.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided information.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan pyebwa sa yo ki mwens kouran nan Pak nasyonal lak yo Plitvice?","The correct answer is **A: Èt (Beech)**.

The passage states that Plitvice National Park has forests of beech, oak, and pine, as well as fir and ash. It also mentions a large community of plant species due to the diversity of microclimates, soil, and altitude.  The question asks which forest type is *less* common.  Since beech is listed along with oak and pine, and fir and ash, and there's no indication it's more or less common than the others, we must infer it's one of the more common ones, and therefore the other options (oak and pine) are more likely to be *less* common than beech. However, since the question directly asks which is *less* common, and beech is listed as one of the trees, the only reasonable answer that isn't explicitly stated as being *less* common is beech.
"
Kilès nan espès ra sa yo ki genyen nan Pak nasyonal lak yo Plitvice?,"The correct answer is **D: Gran Tetra (Brown Bear)**.

The text explicitly mentions the European brown bear (lous mawon ewopeyen an) as a rare species found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. While other animals are mentioned, only the brown bear is listed as a rare species in this context.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ak kisa kòd rejyon yo vrèman ede?","The correct answer is **B: Kontwòl mache**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Objektif aktyèl la se bay konpayi sa yo plis kontwòl sou mache yo; li nan tout bagay se otou lajan."" (The current objective is to give these companies more control over the market; it's all about money.)

While the passage mentions the stated objective of ""preventing piracy,"" it argues that this is a false pretense and the *real* objective is market control.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ki se yon manti sou kòd rejyon ke antrepriz medya yo konsève yo?","The correct answer is **A: Yo nesesè pou gen plis kontwòl mache a** and **D: Yo raman ede anpeche piarataj**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Objektif aktyèl la se bay konpayi sa yo plis kontwòl sou mache yo; li nan tout bagay se otou lajan.""  It also says that the regional codes ""pa gen pyès enpak sou kopi ilegal"" and that a pirated copy plays just as well as the original.

Therefore, the statement that the codes are meant to prevent piracy is a lie, and the real objective is market control. Option D is also directly stated in the passage.

While option B is what the media companies *claim*, the passage argues it's not true. Option C is implied by the overall sentiment that it's ""tout bagay se otou lajan"" (it's all about money). However, A is the most direct and accurate answer based on the text.
"
"Lè ou rive nan peyi orijin ou, ki pwosesis ki jeneralman enfòmèl?","The correct answer is **A: Verifikasyon imigrasyon**.

Here's why:

The passage states that immigration control is generally absent or a formality upon arrival in your home country. Therefore, the process that's generally informal upon arrival is the immigration verification process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Deklarasyon atik (Declaration of items):** While you might declare items at customs, the passage says the customs control *can* be a source of trouble, implying it's not always informal.
*   **C: Limit legal pou atik yo (Legal limits for items):** This is a requirement to be aware of, but not a process that's generally informal.
*   **D: Kontwòl ladwàn (Customs control):** The passage explicitly says customs control *can* be a source of trouble."
Kilès nan sa yo ou ta dwe konnen anvan ou rive nan peyi orijin ou?,"The correct answer is **A: Si pral genyen yon pwen verifikasyon imigrasyon**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph discusses the contrast between lax immigration control upon arrival and strict customs control.** It implies you need to be prepared for immigration checks.
* **Option A directly addresses this:** Knowing if there will be an immigration checkpoint is crucial for preparation.
* **Options B, C, and D are consequences of not being prepared for immigration or customs checks, not things you need to *know in advance* before arriving.**

Therefore, the most logical answer based on the provided text is knowing if there will be an immigration checkpoint.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, yon abondans de sa ki pèmèt alpinis yo toujou ap dekouvri nouvo wout nan Cochamó Valley?","The correct answer is **A: Vi** (Life).

The passage states: ""Grinpè ki soti nan tout pati nan mond lan toujou etabli nouvo wout pami potansyèl mi li yo **san fen**.""  The word ""san fen"" (endless/infinite) implies a continuing, ongoing abundance. ""Vi"" is the best translation for this ongoing existence or activity.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Somè** (Peaks): While peaks are part of the valley, the passage doesn't directly say that the peaks themselves are the source of new routes.
* **C: Anwo Somè** (Top of Peaks): Similar to ""Peaks,"" this is a location, not the reason for the ongoing route discovery.
* **D: Miray** (Mirages): Mirages are not relevant to climbing routes.



"
"Selon enfòmasyon yo bay nan pasaj la, kilès ki plis travèse Emisfè Sid la?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Star Alliance kouvri tout bagay sof Pasifik Sid oryantal Santiago Chili ak Tahiti..."" which means Star Alliance covers almost all routes in the Southern Hemisphere.
"
Ki alyans ayeryèn ki kouvri mwens kantite travèse oseyan nan Emisfè Sid la?,"The correct answer is **D: SkyTeam**.

The text explicitly states that SkyTeam does not cover any transoceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere.
"
Ki òganizasyon vwayaj ki te siksede Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage states that Go Running Tours *replaced* Global Running Tours and brought together multiple service providers. While Running Copenhagen, Running Tours Prague, and Running Tours Barcelona are mentioned as part of the Go Running Tours network, the question asks which *organization* succeeded Global Running Tours, and that organization is Go Running Tours.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, Go Running Tours ede konekte ki kantite diferan òganizasyon kous a pye?","The correct answer is **C: Plizyè Douzèn (Several dozens)**.

The passage states: ""Ranplasan Global Running Tours lan, Go Running Tours mete an rezo plizyè dizèn founisè sèvis kous ak pye yo sou kat kontinan."" This directly translates to ""Replacing Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours networks dozens of running and walking tour providers across continents."""
Kisa yon touris ta dwe fè si li espere fè yon chitas nan fason ki pi klè posib?,"The correct answer is **C: Itilize longvi (Use binoculars)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that lions are ""pafwa timid"" (sometimes shy) and you will see them ""pi byen ak longvi"" (better with binoculars). 
* Option C directly addresses this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ale nan yon safari randone (Go on a walking safari):** While walking safaris offer a different experience, the text doesn't specifically say they are the best way to see lions.
* **B: Fè yon pwomnad nan forè (Take a walk in the forest):**  The text focuses on observing African wildlife on the savanna, not in forests.
* **D: Pran yon machin epi itilize ekipman estanda (Take a car and use standard equipment):** The text implies that using binoculars is more effective than standard equipment for spotting shy animals like lions.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki tip bèt yon vizitè gen plis chans pou rankontre pandan yon sòti safari nan yon veyikil?","The correct answer is **B: Jiraf**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kèk animal, tankou elefan yo ak jiraf yo gen tandans pou apwoche bò kote machin yo epi ekipman òdinè a pèmèt byen obsève yo.""  This translates to: ""Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach the side of the vehicles and the equipment allows for good observation.""

This indicates that giraffes are more likely to be seen closely from a vehicle than lions, cheetahs, or leopards.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki ta ka bese pri yon toune?","The correct answer is **D: Jwenn yon gwoup sis oswa plis moun**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vizit yo mwens chè pou gwo gwoup yo..."" which translates to ""Visits are cheaper for large groups..."" It then advises forming groups of four to six people for a better per-person rate.  Option D directly reflects this.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès ki t ap gen plis chans pou jwenn pi bon tarif pou yon toune?","The correct answer is **A: Touris ki prè pou chanje machin (Tourists who are willing to change vehicles)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ta sanble se yon fason pou fè moun yo kwe ke yo ta dwe peye pi chè. **Touris yo deplase pou ranpli machin yo.**"" This implies that if tourists are willing to switch vehicles to fill them up, they are more likely to get a better price. The passage also explicitly suggests forming groups of 4-6 people for better rates.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki te kontribye nan rekonèt San Francisco nan tout monn lan?","The correct answer is **A: Yon prezans souvan nan divès fòm art ak medya**.

The passage states: ""Reprezantasyon li nan mizik, fim, literati ak kilti popilè vin fè yo konnen vil la ak moniman li yo nan lemond antye."" This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Etablisman kongrè tòp modèn yo:** While San Francisco has excellent convention facilities (mentioned as part of its tourism infrastructure), the passage doesn't say this is *what* makes it known worldwide.
* **C: Divèsite ekonomik la:** The passage mentions economic diversity as a characteristic, but it doesn't explicitly state that this is what makes San Francisco famous globally.
* **D: Yon sèn alimantè azyatik ki an devlopman:** The passage mentions the development of Asian cuisine, but it's not presented as the primary reason for San Francisco's worldwide recognition.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo konsènan San Francisco ki pa laverite?","The correct answer is **D: Ekonomi an antyèman repoze sou touris** (The economy is entirely based on tourism).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that San Francisco's economy is diversified.** It lists several sectors beyond tourism, including professional services, government, finance, and commerce.
* **A:** The passage mentions San Francisco's representation in music, film, literature, and pop culture, which implies it's shown in films and videos.
* **B:** The passage specifically mentions San Francisco being a great place for Asian cuisine, listing Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese as examples.
* **C:** The passage states that San Francisco has developed a large tourism infrastructure with hotels and convention facilities.

Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the passage."
"Dapre pasaj la, ki tip vwayajè ki gen mwens chans pou benefisye de sèvis yon ajan vwayaj?","The best answer is **B: Yon vwayajè ki renmen fè bagay yo san planifye**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the benefits of travel agents for planning and securing accommodations.** It mentions agents handle reservations, negotiate with hotels, and offer packages.
* **A traveler who prefers to travel without planning wouldn't need or benefit from this assistance.** They likely prefer to make spontaneous decisions and book things independently.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

* **A: Yon vwayajè endesi:**  While an indecisive traveler *might* benefit from an agent to give them time to think, it's not the primary reason someone wouldn't use an agent.
* **C: Yon vwayajè ki poko genyen viza li:**  An agent *can* help with visa documentation, so this isn't a reason to avoid them.
* **D: Yon vwayajè ki prefere rezève fòfè yo:** The passage states that travel agents *propose* packages. Someone who prefers packages would likely *use* a travel agent.

Kilès nan sa yo ki pa mansyone nan pasaj la kòm yon avantaj ki genyen lè yon moun fè rezèvasyon atravè yon ajan vwayaj?,"The correct answer is **A: Dokiman vwayaj akselere (Accelerated travel documents)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions several benefits of using a travel agent:
    *   Finding accommodation
    *   Package deals including meals, airport transfers, and flights/hotel stays.
    *   Holding reservations.
    *   Handling modifications and requests with the hotel.
*   The passage **doesn't** mention any benefit related to speeding up travel document processing. The other options (B, C, and D) are all explicitly stated as advantages.



Therefore, ""Accelerated travel documents"" is the only option not mentioned in the passage."
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa aplikasyon tradiksyon tèks nan tan reyèl yo pa ka fè?","The correct answer is **A: Tradwi sit nan lang etranje**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the app can translate ""segman an antye tèks yo sòti nan yon lang ak yon lòt"" and even translate text on objects in the real world.
* It mentions Google Translate's ability to translate ""tèks sou objè yo pa mwayen esmatfòn"".
* While the passage notes that the translations aren't always perfect, it doesn't say they *can't* translate websites. The passage only highlights their capability for text segments and real-world objects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tradwi tout segman tèks yo:** The passage states that the app *can* translate whole segments of text.
* **C: Tradwi tèks sou objè yo pa mwayen esmatfòn:** The passage explicitly says the app *can* translate text on objects using a smartphone.
* **D: Tradwi ak presizyon 100% lè:** The passage mentions the translations are ""souvan kèk tradiksyon ki plizoumwen kòrèk (epi pa souvan charabya)"" and ""fo ankò"", so they don't provide 100% accuracy.



"
Kisa ki pèmèt tradiksyon yo fèt san entènèt?,"The correct answer is **C: Telechajman done sou lang (Downloading language data)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Youn nan aplikasyon ki pi enpòtan nan kategori sa se Google Translate, ki pèmèt tradiksyon san pa an liy apre w fin telechaje done lengistik ou swete yo."" (One of the most important applications in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after you have downloaded the linguistic data you want.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amelyorasyon motè tradiksyon yo (Improvements to translation engines):** While improvements are important, they don't *enable* offline translation.  They just make the online translation better.
* **B: Esmatfòn (Smartphone):**  A smartphone is a device, but it's the *downloaded data* that makes the offline translation possible.
* **D: Aplikasyon nan kategori tradiksyon tan reyèl yo (Applications in the real-time translation category):** This is too broad.  While the application is necessary, it's the specific action of downloading language data *within* that application that makes offline translation possible.



"
Kilès nan sa yo ki pa yon deklanchè pou avalanch?,"The correct answer is **A: Nèj ki kolan (Sticky snow)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that snow is sticky *because* it needs a trigger to slide. It's the *condition* that allows an avalanche, not the trigger itself.
* **Moun (Humans)** are mentioned as sometimes causing triggers.
* **Limyè solèy (Sunlight)** is mentioned as a possible trigger.
* **Nèj adisyonèl (Additional snow)** is mentioned as a possible trigger.

Therefore, sticky snow is not a trigger; it's the type of snow that *responds* to triggers.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan sa yo ki tonbe kòm avalanch?","The correct answer is **C: Eksè nan volim nèj sou pant rèd yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the problem is ""excesso de volume de neve"" (excess volume of snow) on steep slopes leading to avalanches.
* It also explains that the sticky nature of snow requires a trigger to release.
* Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they don't reflect the cause of avalanches as described in the passage.  The snow needs to be *excessive* and on a *steep slope* to be prone to avalanching, regardless of its stickiness or whether it's been touched.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ak ki engredyan yo fè yon curry?","The correct answer is **B: Plant ak epis**.

The passage states: ""Yon Yon Kiri se yon pla ki baze sou fèy ak epis, ki melanje ansanm ak vyann oswa legim."" (A curry is a dish based on leaves and spices, mixed with meat or vegetables.)

While yogurt and coconut milk are *sometimes* used, the passage identifies leaves and spices as the core ingredients.
"
"Nan sèten rejyon, yo pafwa itilize lèt kokoye nan plas ki engredyan nan yon curry?","The correct answer is **C: Yogout**.

The text states: ""Nan zòn rekile pati Nò Lend ak Pakistan, yo plis itilize yogout nan curry; nan sid Lend ak kèk lòt zòn kotyè nan sou kontinan yo itilize lèt kokoye.""  This directly answers the question of what is used as a substitute for a curry ingredient in certain regions.
"
Poukisa yo dwe kontounen Mòn Transantaktik yo pou rive sou plato a?,"The correct answer is **C: Traktè espesyalize yo pa ajil**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Sa yo pa trè ajil, konsa pis la dwe fè yon long koub ozalantou mòn transantatik yo pou rive sou plato a.""  This directly links the lack of agility of the specialized tractors to the need to go around the mountains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Estasyon McMurdo la souvan fèmen:** The passage doesn't mention the station being closed.
* **B: Nèj konpakte la danjre:** While the snow is described as having cracks and being compacted, the danger isn't the *reason* for the detour, but a characteristic of the travel surface.
* **D: Li pi fasil pase pou vwayaje pa Lamè Ross la:** The passage describes the ice road as being used for hauling supplies *to* McMurdo, implying it's the primary route.  It doesn't suggest sea travel is easier.



"
"Toutolon Travèse Pòl Sid la, kisa ki make avèk drapo?","The correct answer is **C: Krevas ki ranpli ak nèj (Cracks filled with snow)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Travès (oswa otowout) pol sid la se yon pis 1600 km ki rive nan estasyon McMurdo a sou lanmè Ross la jous nan pol la. Li se nèj konpakte **avèk fant ki ranpli epi make ak drapo**.""  This translates to: ""The Transantarctic Traverse (or highway) is a 1600 km ice road that reaches McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the South Pole. It is compacted snow **with cracks filled and marked with flags**."" Therefore, the cracks are marked with flags.
"
Kisa ki pa mansyone nan pasaj la kòm yon bagay touris yo ta dwe konnen lè y ap eksplore Sid Afrik la?,"The correct answer is **C: Prèske tout peyi vwazen Sid Afrik la estab**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Pandan w'ap fè planifikasyon sa kenbe nan tèt ou menm Sid Afrik stab pa vle di tout peyi ki vwazen ak li konsa tou."" This directly contradicts option C.
* Options A, B, and D are all mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, the passage *doesn't* say that almost all neighboring countries to South Africa are stable. In fact, it implies the opposite.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki t ap konsidere kòm yon move konsèy pou touris k ap chèche eksplore Sid Afrik la nan machin?","The correct answer is **B: Byenke yon 4x4 rekòmande, pidò lye yo aksesib ak yon veyikil nòmal**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sa kapab fè nan yon mahin nòmal avèk yon planifikasyon pridan, men yon 4x4 konseye anpil epi anpil kote yo aksesib sèlman ak yon 4x4 ak anpatman ki wo."" This means that while a 4x4 is *recommended*, it isn't *always* necessary. Therefore, suggesting that ""all places are accessible with a normal vehicle"" is a *bad* piece of advice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lalwa kapab ezije sèten atik ijans nan machin yo:** This is *not* a bad piece of advice; it's important information.
* **C: Vwayaje nan machin bon anpil pou moun k ap chèche devye wout abityèl yo:** The passage *supports* this statement; it says traveling by car is good for exploring off the beaten path.
* **D: Se pa tout peyi vwazen Sid Afrik la ki bon pou vizite:**  The passage *warns* against assuming stability in neighboring countries, which is a useful warning, not a bad piece of advice to give to a traveler.



"
Kilès nan sa yo ki pa mansyone nan pasaj la kòm yon danje potansyèl lè ou kite valiz ou yo san siveyans?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo ka konfonn yo ak valiz yon lòt moun**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:** being an unwitting drug mule, being a target for theft, and being mistaken for a bomb threat.
* **The passage does NOT mention:** being confused with someone else's luggage.

Therefore, option C is the one not mentioned in the text.
"
Kisa ki pa mansyone nan pasaj la konsènan transpò dwòg?,"The correct answer is **D: Otorite yo kapab konfiske valiz ou yo, menm si ou pa ap transpòte dwòg.**

Here's why:

* **The passage *does* mention** that unattended luggage can be targeted for drug smuggling, theft, and even bomb threats.
* **The passage *does* mention** that drug-sniffing dogs can be used without notice.
* **The passage *does* mention** that some countries have severe penalties, even for first offenses.
* **However, the passage *doesn't* explicitly state that authorities can confiscate luggage *even if* you're not carrying drugs.** While confiscation *could* happen due to other reasons (suspicion, security concerns), it's not directly stated as a consequence of unattended luggage in the passage.

Therefore, option D is the best answer because it's the *least* supported by the text."
Ki kalite bwason ki pa mansyone kòm yon bagay pou eseye fè lakay ou pandan yon vakans lakay?,"The correct answer is **C: Byè (Beer)**.

The text specifically mentions making juice, coffee, and chamomile tea at home during a vacation. It also suggests trying new drinks at local bars and pubs. Beer is not mentioned at all.
"
Kilès nan lye sa yo ou ta dwe vizite pandan yon vakans lakay ou si yo rekonèt vil ou an pou kilti bwason li?,"The correct answer is **C: Piblisite ou nòmalman pa tonbe sou yo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically says:** ""Si w ap viv nan yon vil kote kilti bwason an varye, ale nan ba restoran yo oswa piblisite katye yo ou pa vizite yo."" (If you live in a city where the drinking culture varies, go to bars or neighborhoods you don't normally visit.)

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Magazen kafe deyò vwazinaj ou an:** While a good option for coffee lovers, the passage emphasizes exploring *new* places for a varied drinking culture, not just more cafes.
* **B: Magazen ji oswa smoothie:** This is a possibility, but not as broad as exploring bars in different neighborhoods.
* **D: Restoran ki prepare dite kamomiy:** This is specific to tea and relaxation, not exploring the broader drinking culture of a city.



"
Kikote eskilti kolonb yo sitiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Nan simityè a**.

The text states: ""Nan simityè legliz la, genyen skilpti mab enteresan ki repranzante pijon sou kèk tomb."" which translates to ""In the church cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures representing pigeons on some tombs.""
"
Ki tip viza ki kapab mande yon moun pou bay sipò prèv ase lajan?,"The correct answer is **D: Viza etidyan**.

The text specifically states: ""Pou majorite peyi yo, ou pral gen bezwen yon lèt òf lekòl kote ou swete etidye an, epi **yon prèv lajan pou soutni w omwens pandan premye lane nan pwogram ou.**""  This requirement for proof of funds is explicitly mentioned in the context of student visas.

While business and tourist visas *might* require proof of funds in some cases, the text directly links the need for proof of funds to student visas.  Temporary visas (C) is too broad a category.
"
Pou kilès li plis posib pou li bezwen yon viza pwolonje?,"The correct answer is **C: Yon etidyan entènasyonal**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Lefètke ou ale antanke etidyan etranje nesesite jeneralman yon sejou pi long pase sa yon senp touris."" (The fact that you are going as a foreign student generally requires a longer stay than a simple tourist.)  It then goes on to detail the specific requirements for student visas, such as a letter of acceptance and proof of funds. This indicates that students are more likely to need a longer-term visa than tourists or business travelers.
"
Kilè ou ta dwe plis fè atansyon ak moustik yo?,"The best answer is **C: Nan forè twopikal**

Here's why:

* **The text specifically mentions tropical forests.** It says to be particularly careful around mosquitoes *especially if you decide to take a walk in a tropical forest*.
* **While the other options are related, they aren't as specific:**
    * **A: Pandan mwa ete yo (In the summer):** Mosquitoes are generally more prevalent in the summer, but the text emphasizes the specific location (tropical forest).
    * **B: Nan randone yo (On hikes):** Hiking can occur in various environments, not just tropical forests.
    * **D: Pandan w ap kondwi (While driving):** The text mentions mosquitoes getting *into the car* while driving, but the main point is the risk associated with the tropical forest environment.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ou ta dwe evite fè pou evite moustik yo lè w ap kondwi nan forè twopikal la?","The correct answer is **A: Kite pòt veyikil la louvri pandan twòp tan**.

The passage specifically states: ""Même si vous conduisez dans la forêt tropicale, quelques secondes avec la porte ouverte pendant que vous montez dans la voiture suffisent pour que les moustiques montent dans la voiture avec vous.""  This translates to: ""Even if you are driving in the tropical forest, a few seconds with the door open while you get into the car is enough for mosquitoes to get into the car with you.""

Therefore, leaving the car door open for even a short time is what you should avoid.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo konsènan Sundarbans yo ki pa laverite?","The correct answer is **B: Mwatye nan sipèfisi total li a kouvri ak marekaj (Half of its total area is covered by mangroves)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Depi 1966 Sundarbans se yon rezèv natirèl, epi yo te estime gen kounya 400 tig Bengale wayal ak anviwon 30,000 sèf nan rejyon an. **Pami yo anviwon yon tyè kouvri pa zòn dlo/marekaj.**""  This means *one-third*, not half, is covered by water/mangrove areas.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Nou jwenn kèk nan ra jeng pisan ki rete yo (It contains some of the last remaining large forests):** The passage says, ""...yo gen ladan yo kèk dènye vestij gwo jeng yo ki te kouvri lontan plèn Gange lan (it includes some of the last vestiges of the large forests that once covered the Ganges plain).""
* **C: Se pi gran zòn mangwòv nan monn lan (It is the largest mangrove area in the world):** The passage states, ""Se pi gran zòn mangwòv nan monn lan (It is the largest mangrove area in the world).""
* **D: Se fwaye pou plis sèf tachte pase tig Bengal (It is home to more spotted deer than Bengal tigers):** The passage states, ""...yo te estime gen kounya 400 tig Bengale wayal ak anviwon 30,000 sèf nan rejyon an (it is estimated to have currently 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the region).""



"
Ki pati nan forè a ki twouve l nan teritwa Endyen an?,"The correct answer is **A: Pak Nasyonal Sundarbans yo** (Sundarbans National Park).

The text states: ""Pati forè a sitiye sou teritwa endyen an ki rele pak nasyonal Sundarbans."" which translates to ""Part of the forest is located on the Indian territory called Sundarbans National Park.""
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès ki gen plis posiblite pou genyen yon konpreyansyon limite nan lang Anglè a?","The correct answer is **B: Moun ki pi jèn nan laj (Younger people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nan anpil peyi angle se yon lang kouran, e nan anpil lòt ou ka gen yon konesans limite - espesyalman kote sa ki pi piti yo."" This directly indicates that younger people are more likely to have a limited understanding of English.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moun ki pale omwen de lòt lang:** While multilingualism can sometimes influence language skills, the passage specifically points to age as the primary factor.
*   **C: Moun k ap vwayaje pou ale Toronto:** Traveling doesn't inherently mean someone has a limited understanding of English.
*   **D: Moun ki pi granmoun nan laj:** The passage specifically mentions younger people having a limited understanding.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki ka difisil pou pwononse?","The correct answer is **B: Adrès**.

The passage specifically states: ""Mo ki ekri yo souvan pi fasil pou konprann pase mo pale yo, menm jan. Sa sitou vre pou adrès yo ki souvan difisil pou pwononse yon mannyè klè."" (Written words are often easier to understand than spoken words, likewise. This is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce clearly.)

While the passage discusses accents and local languages, it explicitly links difficulty in pronunciation to *addresses*.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki senaryo ki pi bon pou yon vwayajè k ap planifye pou pran yon otobis apati estasyon entè-distri a?","The best answer is **D: Vwayajè ki prale nan zòn lès epi ki rive nan estasyon an anvan 6:20**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that buses going east leave between 6:30 and 7:30. 
* To catch a bus leaving before 6:30, the traveler needs to arrive *before* 6:20.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vwayajè ki prale Jakar epi ki te deja achte yon tikè alavans:**  The passage doesn't mention anything about needing to buy tickets in advance, or any specific time constraints for traveling to Paro.
* **B: Vwayajè ki prale Bumthang epi ki bezwen deplase a 7 è:**  The passage states buses going to Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30. To *arrive* by 7:00, one would need to be at the station *before* 6:30, making option D a better fit.
* **C: Vwayajè ki prale Paro epi ki bezwen deplase aprè 11 è:** The passage doesn't offer specific timing information about buses to Paro after 11:00.



"
Kisa ki t ap yon bon konsèy pou yon touris k ap vwayaje nan zòn lès soti nan estasyon otobis entè-distri a?,"The correct answer is **D: Yon taksi pataje kapab mwayen vwayaj ki pi entelijan an**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Taksi kolektif yo se yon mwayen rapid epi konfòtab pou rann ou kote pwòch ou yo, tankou Paro (Nu 150) ak Punakha (Nu 200)."" This means shared taxis are a good option.
* The text also mentions the difficulty of catching buses before 8:30, eliminating options A and C.
* While buying tickets in advance (option B) might be generally good advice, the text doesn't specifically mention it as relevant to the East district.
"
Kilès nan sa yo ki pa yon deskripsyon egzat pou Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Li pa aksesib nan avyon (It is not accessible by plane)**.

The text explicitly states: ""li gen yon ayopò"" (it has an airport). This directly contradicts option C. The other options are all supported by the text:

* **A: Li genyen plis yon enfliyans Arab pase rès peyi a (It has more Arab influence than the rest of the country):** The text says ""li plis gen lè arab ke afriken"" (it has more Arab air than African).
* **B: Li frape pa povrete (It is struck by poverty):** The text says ""Jodi a, Tonmbouktou se yon vil pòv"" (Today, Tombouctou is a poor city).
* **D: Li rete yon atraksyon pou touris ki kirye yo (It remains an attraction for curious tourists):** The text says ""repitasyon l fè l yon atraksyon touristik"" (its reputation makes it a tourist attraction).



"
Kilès nan fè sa yo sou Timbuktu ki laverite?,"The correct answer is **A: Vil la aksesib nan avyon**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...li gen yon ayopò."" (it has an airport). This directly supports option A.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The text says Timbuktu is a ""pouv"" (poor) city, not more exotic.
* **Option C is correct:** The text explicitly states, ""li plis gen lè arab ke afriken"" (it has more Arab air than African). This supports option C.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The text says it *is* a tourist attraction, implying it *is* attracting tourists.

Therefore, both A and C are correct statements according to the text. However, the question asks which *one* is true.  Since the text specifically mentions the airport, **A is a more direct and undeniable statement.** C is a comparative statement and implies further cultural analysis. 



"
Kilè yo te pwograme Jwèt Olenpik ete yo oparavan? ,"The correct answer is **D: Jiyè 2020**.

The text states: ""Nap atann nou pou majorite biyè yo ta vann ant ¥2,500 ak ¥130,000, biyè tipik yo koute anviron ¥7,000. **Nap atann nou pou majorite politik pou anile yo baze sou kowonaviris p ap etann yo jouk jiyè 2020, dat sa ki te prevwa pou jwèt olenmpik yo fèt.**""

This clearly indicates that the Olympics were originally scheduled for July 2020.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, nan ki pwen yon antonwa vin yon tònad?","The correct answer is **D: Aprè li fin touche sòl la**.

The passage states: ""Yo kòmanse sou fòm antonwa k ap desann nyaj loraj yo, epi vin """"tònad"""" lè yo **touche tè a**."" (They begin as funnel-shaped columns descending from thunderstorm clouds, and become a ""tornado"" when they **touch the ground**.)
"
Kilès nan sa yo se yon karakteristik egzat pou yon tònad?,"The correct answer is **B: Yo souvan deplase ak gwo objè (They often move with large objects)**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text states:** ""Yo jenere van fò yo (souvan 100-200 miles/lè) epi kapab soulve objè lou yo anlè, transpòte yo toutotan tònad lan ap deplase."" (They generate strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, transporting them as the tornado moves.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo toujou pwodwi apeprè 100-200 miles pa èdtan (They always produce about 100-200 miles per hour):** The text says winds are *often* 100-200 mph, not that they *always* are.
* **C: Yo vin antonwa aprè yo fin touche sòl la (They become funnel-shaped after they have touched the ground):** The text states they *start* as funnel-shaped and become a ""tornado"" *when* they touch the ground.
* **D: Yo se kolòn koutan ki pouse lè a nan direksyon deyò (They are columns of air pushing air outwards):**  The text describes a low-pressure system sucking air *in* and moving *upward*, not pushing air outwards.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, apati ki kote yon vwayajè ta dwe chèche konsèy konsènan sitiyasyon politik la nan vil destinasyon yo a?","The best answer is **D: Nan men pwòp gouvènman yo a**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""You can also want to consult government advice in addition to your own, but the advice is made for citizens."" This indicates that the government of *your own country* is the relevant source for advice.
* The passage also mentions that government advice is tailored to citizens, implying it will be specific to their nationality and potential risks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nan men gouvènman peyi kote yo pral vizite a:** While potentially helpful, the passage cautions that this information is often vague and generalized.  It also mentions different risks for different nationalities.
* **B: Nan pwendvi yo prezante nan avi sou vwayaj yo:** The passage explicitly warns against relying solely on travel advisories as they are often simplified and may not reflect the full picture.
* **C: Nan men sitwayen peyi ou pral vizite a:**  This is impractical and not a reliable source for official advice.



Therefore, **D** is the only option directly supported by the text.



"
"Nan ka yon avi pou vwayajè, ak kisa yon sitwayen etranje gen plis posiblite pou fè fas?","The correct answer is **B: Rezime ki twòp senplifye sou sitiyasyon politik peyi a**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Opinyon ki prezante yo souvan vag, jeneral epi twò senplifye parapò ak enfòmasyon yo ki pi detaye ki disponib lòt kote."" This directly addresses the potential issue with travel advisories.
* While travel advisories *can* affect insurance (options A & C), the passage highlights the simplified and potentially inaccurate political information as a key concern.
* Option D is incorrect because the passage states the information is *not* detailed.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is that a foreign citizen is most likely to encounter a **simplified and potentially misleading summary of the country's political situation** in a travel advisory.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki tip vwayaj ki gen mwens posiblite pou bezwen asistans pou rezèvasyon nan men yon ajan vwayaj?","The answer is **A: Yon vwayaj pou yon konferans travay nan vil vwayajè a te vizite anvan.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that travel agencies are particularly helpful for trips involving unfamiliarity with nature, culture, language, or less-developed countries.** 
* A business trip to a familiar city is unlikely to require that level of assistance. The traveler is already familiar with the location and likely has established processes for travel arrangements related to business conferences.

Let's look at why the other options are more likely to *need* an agency:

* **B: Yon long vwayaj de semèn sou yon bidjè trè patikilye:**  Budget travel often requires specialized knowledge and connections that an agency can provide.
* **C: Yon vwayaj ki pral prezante yon baryè lang:**  An agency can help navigate language barriers by arranging translators, providing information in the traveler's language, and generally simplifying communication.
* **D: Premye vwayaj yon vwayajè aletranje:** First-time international travelers are most likely to benefit from the guidance and expertise of a travel agency.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, nan ki senaryo yon vwayajè t ap plis benefisye de èd yon ajan vwayaj?","The correct answer is **B: Lè vwayajè a swete rezève yon ekskisyon espesyalize pou premye fwa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yon ajans vwayaj se jeneralman yon bon opsyon ki ale piwo pase eksperyans avan vwayajè a nan sa ki konsène lanati, kilti, lang oswa peyi ki gen fèb revni."" This indicates that travel agencies are helpful when dealing with unfamiliar or specialized travel experiences.
* **Option B aligns with this:**  Booking a specialized excursion for the first time falls squarely into the category of an unfamiliar travel experience. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The passage doesn't mention anything about booking round-trip flights to one's home country.
* **C:**  Knowing the native language of the destination isn't related to needing a travel agent.
* **D:**  Visiting a place with similar cultural differences doesn't necessitate the help of a travel agent.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki te ka ede yon vwayaje pou evite desepsyon pandan l ap vizite nouvo lye yo?","The correct answer is **C: Respekte menm lwa ak kote yo soti ladan an.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""Lè w ap vwayaje... lwa yo, manje, sikilasyon, lojman, règleman, lang elatriye diferan nan kèk mezi de kote w ap viv lan."" This means you need to be aware of and respect the different laws and customs of the place you're visiting.  Respekte menm lwa (respect the same laws) directly addresses this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Espere nòm similè ak peyi yo soti ladan an (Expect similar norms to your home country):** The passage *warns against* this. It says things *are* different.
* **B: Yon volonte pou eseye nouvo manje ki pa familye (A willingness to try new unfamiliar food):** While trying new food *can* enhance a trip, it's not the primary way to avoid disappointment.
* **D: Evite fè rechèch ebèjman alavans (Avoid researching accommodation in advance):**  This is a bad idea! Planning accommodation is essential for a smooth trip.



"
"Dapre enfòmasyon ki nan pasaj la, ki kalite moun ki ta ka desi lè y ap vwayaje nan yon lye etranje?","The best answer is **C: Yon moun ki gen lespri fèmen (Someone with a closed mind).**

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes the importance of being aware of differences in laws, customs, food, transportation, housing, and language. 
* It warns against ""desepsyon oswa petèt tout rejè tankou kèk mannyè lokal yo pou fè bagay yo"" - disappointment or even rejection due to different ways of doing things.
* This suggests that someone with a closed mind, unwilling to adapt to new situations and cultures, would be most likely to experience these negative outcomes.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Yon moun ki renmen manje egzotik (Someone who loves exotic food):** While enjoying new food is part of traveling, the passage focuses on broader cultural differences.
* **B: Yon moun ki renmen chanjman (Someone who loves change):**  While open to change is helpful, the passage is more about being *aware* of differences, not necessarily *loving* them.  Someone who doesn't understand cultural nuances might still struggle even if they enjoy change.
* **D: Yon moun ki renmen aprann (Someone who loves to learn):**  The passage indirectly suggests a willingness to learn is beneficial, but it directly highlights the problems for someone who *doesn't* want to understand or accept different ways of doing things.



"
Kilès nan sa yo ki se konsèy yo pa rekòmande pou vwayajè k ap vizite yon peyi an devlopman pou premye fwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Envesti nan yon otèl de kalite lè ou rive premye fwa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage advises to initially embrace Western-style hotels, food, and service to help with adjustment.** This directly contradicts investing in a high-end hotel right away.
* **The passage explicitly mentions adjusting to new environments and not underestimating cultural shock.** Staying in a luxurious hotel immediately might create a disconnect from the local culture and make adjustment harder.

Let's look at why the other options *are* recommended:

* **A: Aprann konnen fòn lokal la anvan ou dòmi atè a:**  The passage advises caution about sleeping on the ground in unfamiliar areas.
* **B: Evite fè foli nan maje pandan premye jou yo:** The passage suggests adapting by initially enjoying familiar comforts (like Western-style hotels).
* **C: Yo rekòmande pou kabann pou kan oswa yon amak si w ap fè kan anplennè:** The passage suggests using these to protect against animals while camping.



"
Kilès sa yo ke yo pa mansyone kòm yon bagay pou fè foli pou li lè w ap aklimate ak yon peyi an devlopman?,"The correct answer is **C: Yon matla oswa tapi pou kan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states to ""don't sleep on a mat or a pillow on the ground in areas where you don't know the local floor strength."" This implies it's something *not* to do, not something to ""go wild"" with.

The passage *does* suggest embracing Western-style hotels, service quality, and potentially even food styles *initially* as a way to adjust.

Therefore, option C is the only one listed as something to *avoid* (or at least be cautious of) during the initial adjustment period, making it the correct answer.
"
"Kilès nan opsyon sa yo ki t ap pi bon pou yon detantè polis asirans ki vle yon kopi vityèl polis asirans li a, men ki kapab pa gen aksè ak entènèt?","The correct answer is **C: Konsève yon kopi nan memwa laptòp li**.

Here's why:

* **The question specifies the person might not have internet access.** Options B and D (email and cloud) require internet.
* **Option C (saving a copy on a laptop's memory) is the only option that doesn't depend on an internet connection.**  It allows the policyholder to have a readily accessible digital copy even without internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Remèt yon kopi bay yon konpanyon vwayaj:** This relies on having a companion available and is less reliable.
* **B: Voye yon kopi pa imèl bay tèt li:** Requires internet access.
* **D: Konsève yon kopi nan “cloud”:** Requires internet access.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ki pa bezwen afiche sou yon polis asirans?","The correct answer is **D: Adrès imèl detantè polis asirans lan**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the copy of the insurance policy should include the *assurer's* (insurance provider's) email address and international phone number for advice, authorization, and claim requests.  It doesn't mention the policyholder's email address needing to be on the copy.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Nimewo telefòn entènasyonal pou demann endemnizasyon** - The passage explicitly says this should be included.
* **B: Adrès imèl asirè a** - The passage explicitly says this should be included.
* **C: Nimewo telefòn entènasyonal pou otorizasyon** - The passage explicitly says this should be included.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki tay negatif ki reflete fòma fim yo itilize plis souvan yo?","The correct answer is **C: negatif 35 mm**.

The passage states: ""Gen anpil fòma fim diferan ki te itilize pandan kèk lane. Fim òdinè a 35 mm (negatif 36 pa 24 mm) **komen anpil**."" This directly indicates that the 35mm negative size is the most commonly used.
"
Kilès nan fòma fim sa yo ki ofri rezolisyon ki sanble ak yon DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Fim 35 mm**.

The question states that 35mm film can easily fill the gap and provides a resolution ""similar to that of a current DSLR.""  While medium format (6x6cm and 56x56mm) offers significantly higher resolution, the question specifically asks which offers a *similar* resolution.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ki t ap dènye etap lè w ap kòmanse yon antrepriz pou ekri istwa vwayaj?","The correct answer is **C: Konstwi pwòp sitwèb ou**.

The passage states the following order:

1. **Pèfeksyone sou yon sit blòg vwayaj byen etabli.** (Perfect on an established travel blog)
2. **Lè sa a, ou ta ka kreye pwòp sit entènèt ou.** (Then, you can create your own website.)

Therefore, building your own website is the final step mentioned.
"
"Lè w ap kòmanse yon antrepriz pou ekri istwa vwayaj, kilès nan kapasite sa yo ou ta dwe rafine an premye?","The correct answer is **A: Blogging**.

Here's why:

The prompt states that the easiest way to start is by perfecting your skills on an established travel blog. Blogging is the foundational skill. You need to be comfortable writing and publishing content *before* you can worry about website formatting, editing, or building your own site.

Here's why the other options are less ideal as a *first* step:

* **B: Fòmataj wèb (Web formatting):** Important, but secondary to having content to format.
* **C: Edisyon (Editing):**  Also important, but you need content to edit.
* **D: Kreyasyon sitwèb (Website creation):**  You can't build a website effectively without having content to put on it.

Therefore, **Blogging** is the most logical and foundational skill to refine first when starting a travel writing venture.
"
Nan ki tip klima yo plis jwenn pwoblèm entesten yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Klima cho**.

The text explicitly states: ""nan klima ki fè pi cho yo bakteri grandi pi rapid epi siviv pi lontan deyò kò an. Menm jan pou pwoblèm respiratwwa yo nan klima frèt, pwoblèm entestinal yo rive souvan nan klima cho yo..."" (In warmer climates, bacteria grow faster and survive longer outside the body. Just like respiratory problems in cold climates, intestinal problems occur often in warm climates...).
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ekspozisyon regilye ka lakoz iminite nan kisa?","The correct answer is **B: Mikwòb lokal yo** (Local germs).

The passage states: ""Anndan kay, a koz ekspozisyon jèm lokal yo ki toujou la, chans pou deja iminize kont jèm sa yo anpil.""  This translates to: ""Indoors, the cause is regular exposure to local germs, which gives a high chance of being already immunized against these germs.""
"
Kilès nan sa yo ki se yon avantaj pandan vwayaj nan zòn Schengen nan?,"The correct answer is **A: Evite plizyè aplikasyon pou viza** and **C: Evite plizyè tchèk pou kontwòl paspò**.

Here's why:

* **A: Evite plizyè aplikasyon pou viza:** The text explicitly states that a Schengen visa allows you to travel through multiple Schengen countries without needing a separate visa for each country.
* **C: Evite plizyè tchèk pou kontwòl paspò:** The text mentions that within the Schengen area, you can cross borders without passing through passport control *if you stay within the area*.

While **B: Ekonomize lajan** and **D: Okenn egzijans pou paspò** are benefits of the Schengen area *in general*, they are not directly stated as advantages in *this specific text*.  The text focuses on the visa and passport control aspects.  Also, passports are still required!

Therefore, A and C are the most accurate answers based on the provided passage. Since the question asks to choose *one* correct answer, and both are valid, it's slightly ambiguous. However, **A is a more direct and specific advantage mentioned in the text.**
"
Kisa ki pa disponib ankò nan tonbo Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **B: Tèt momi an** and **C: Zepòl momi an**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tout moun ki ta renmen wè prèv domaj ki te fèt sou momi lè yo te eseye retirel nan sèkèy ap desevwaw paske se **tèt lan ak epòl lan ki vizib**."" This means the head and shoulders are visible, implying they are no longer fully intact within the tomb.

While the riches *were* removed and are in the Egyptian Museum, the question asks what is *not available* *in the tomb*. The visible damage to the head and shoulders indicates those parts are not present in the tomb anymore.

Therefore, both B and C are accurate. However, since we must choose only one, and the text *specifically mentions both the head and shoulders*, and there is no further information to prioritize one over the other, both B and C are valid. Since the question implies a single best answer, and the damage is specifically described as affecting the head *and* shoulders, I would lean towards **B: Tèt momi an** as the more directly and prominently mentioned element. However, it's important to note that C is equally correct based on the text.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki destinasyon nan Vancouver ki t ap mwens atiran pou vwayajè ki gen bidjè sere yo? ","The correct answer is **D: Whistler**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Whistler (ak 1.5 èdtan wout de Vancouver) se yon vil ki chè men trè repite akoz Jwèt olenmpik ivè 2010 yo."" This translates to ""Whistler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is a town that is expensive but very renowned because of the 2010 Winter Olympics."" Therefore, Whistler is presented as a less budget-friendly option.

The other options are presented as attractive destinations:

*   **Zile Granville** is described as having shops, restaurants, and activities.
*   **Koulwa The Sea to Sky** is described as an ""indispensable stroll"" for outdoor enthusiasts.
*   **Zile Bowen** is described as offering kayaking, hiking, shops, and restaurants.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki destinasyon ki gen plis posiblite pou ofri vwayajè yo yon eksperyans otantik pou Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Zile Bowen**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Zile Bowen offers an ""authentic community"" and lists activities like kayaking, hiking, shops, and restaurants, suggesting a more local and less tourist-focused experience.
* While Whistler is mentioned, it's described as a ""expensive town"" and known for the Olympics, leaning more towards a tourist destination than an ""authentic"" experience.
* Granville Island is mentioned as the departure point for the ferry, but not as a destination in itself offering a broader range of experiences.
* The passage doesn't mention anything about ""Sant Vil Granville"" as a destination.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilè vwayajè yo ta dwe vizite Falls yo si y ap chèche vi ki san obstak?","The correct answer is **D: Andeyò sezon lapli a**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Pendant sezon lapli (novanb rive mas), volim dlo a plis et chit yo dramatik."" This translates to ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water volume is higher and the falls are dramatic.""

It also says, ""On the other hand, because the water volume rises a lot, the view of the falls will be obscured - not all the water is visible!""

Therefore, to have an unobstructed view, you should visit **outside of the rainy season**, which is **Andeyò sezon lapli a**.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki avantaj ki genyen nan vizite Chit Victoria yo ant Novanm ak Mas?","The correct answer is **C: Vi dramatik sou Chit yo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pendant sezon lapli (novanb rive mas), volim dlo a plis et chit yo dramatik."" This translates to ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water volume is higher and the falls are dramatic.""

The passage also mentions being wet when crossing the bridge or walking near the falls during this time. This indicates a more powerful and impressive display of the falls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vi san obstak sou Chit yo** (Clear view of the falls): The passage says the view *won't* be clear due to the increased water volume.
*   **B: Mwens touris** (Fewer tourists): The passage doesn't mention anything about fewer tourists.
*   **D: Avite sezon lapli a** (Enjoy the rainy season): While technically true, the question asks about the *advantage* of visiting during that time, and the dramatic view is a more specific and compelling advantage mentioned in the text.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sa yo ke yo pa rekòmande pandan itilizasyon yon dwòn pou filme?","The correct answer is **D: Filme sèlman nan zòn ki gen anpil kote yo p ap remake dwòn nan.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Fè yon dwo n vole tou prè yon ayewopò oswa sou tèt yon foul se prèske toujou yon move lide..."" This implies avoiding filming in areas where it would be disruptive or cause concern.  Option D is the closest to that general idea, though it's not a direct quote.
* The passage strongly emphasizes the need to **verify what you are authorized to film** and any **necessary permits or licenses.** This makes options A, B, and C relevant, but option D addresses the implied concern of where *not* to film, which is what the question asks.

The other options are supported by the text:

* **A: Tcheke alavans pou konnen sa ki otorize pou filme:** The passage says this is crucial (""verify well in advance"").
* **B: Jwenn lisans adisyonèl:**  The passage mentions ""lisans adisyonèl ki nesesè yo.""
* **C: Pèmi rechèch:** While not explicitly mentioned, permits could include research permits.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki pi bon kote pou filme ak yon dwòn?","The correct answer is **D: Nan lye ki okipe kote dwòn nan mwens vizib.**

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes the importance of knowing what you're allowed to film and obtaining necessary permissions.
* It explicitly warns against flying drones near airports or over crowds.
* Option D directly reflects the advice to ensure you have permission (implied by ""pèmi"") and to choose a location where drone activity is less likely to cause problems (less visible).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tou pre foul moun ki p ap santi yo deranje ak prezans dwòn nan** - This is explicitly discouraged by the passage (""Fè yon dwo n vole tou prè yon ayewopò oswa sou tèt yon foul se prèske toujou yon move lide"").
* **B: Nan zòn kote yo pa otorize fotografi regilye yo** - This is not the point. The passage is about *legal* drone operation, not exploiting areas with restricted photography.
* **C: Nan lye ki okipe kote dwòn nan mwens vizib** - While this could be *a* location, it doesn't address the critical need for permission.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer because it aligns with the passage's emphasis on legality, permissions, and avoiding problematic locations.
"
"Selon pasaj la, ki deklarasyon konsènan kondisyon enskripsyon pou pwosesis viza a ki pa laverite?","The correct answer is **B: Tout peyi mande anrejistreman bò kote otorite lokal yo**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nan anpil peyi ki gen lwa konsa. Otèl local yo okipe anregistran yo (rasirew ou mande sa). Nan lòt ka, sèlman moun ki pa loje nan etablisman touristik yo ki dwe anrejistre."" This shows that *not* all countries require registration with local authorities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Si w ap rete nan etablisman touristik yo, ou kapab pa bezwen anrejistre:** The passage says this is true (""Nan lòt ka, sèlman moun ki pa loje nan etablisman touristik yo ki dwe anrejistre"").
* **C: Yon vizit nan biwo imigrasyon yo kapab nesesè:** The passage states this is possible (""Nan kèk peyi, ou dwe anrejistre prezans ou ak adrès kote w ap fè sejou an nan men otorite lokal yo. Sa kapab nesesite pou ranpli yo fòmilè avèk lapolis lokal o **fòmilè avèk lapolis lokal** o **rann ou nan biwo imigrasyon yo**"").
* **D: Nan kèk lye, otèl lokal yo ka jere anrejistreman an:**  The passage confirms this (""Otèl local yo okipe anregistran yo (rasirew ou mande sa)"").



"
Kilès nan sa yo ki pa yon lye yon touris kapab ale pou jere anrejistreman li a?,"The correct answer is **A: Yon pòs lapolis lokal** and **D: Biwo imigrasyon yo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that in some countries, you need to register your presence and address with *local authorities*. 
*   It specifically mentions filling out forms with the *local police* or going to *immigration offices*. 
*   Therefore, a local police station (Yon pòs lapolis lokal) and immigration offices (Biwo imigrasyon yo) are places where you might need to handle this registration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Otèl kote yo ye a** - The passage says hotels *sometimes* handle registration, but it's not always the case.  It doesn't say it's *always* the place to go.
*   **C: Yon biwo lapòs lokal** - The passage doesn't mention a local post office as a place for registration.



"
Kilès ki pa t ap gen enterè pou fè travay volontè lè l ap vwayaje?,"The correct answer is **A: Yon moun ki espere fè nouvo zanmi prale aletranje**

Here's why:

The passage states that volunteering abroad is good for:

*   Learning about different cultures
*   Meeting new people
*   Learning more about yourself
*   Gaining new skills
*   Potentially saving money on accommodation and food through work opportunities.

Option A, ""Yon moun ki espere fè nouvo zanmi prale aletranje"" (Someone who hopes to make new friends while traveling) is *implied* as a benefit of volunteering, but it's not the *primary* focus or the reason someone wouldn't be interested. The other options (seeking a salary, gaining new skills, and needing accommodation/food) are all explicitly mentioned as potential benefits.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kijan travay volontè aletranje nan avantaj yon vwayajè ki sou yon bidjè?","The correct answer is **C: Yo souvan bay manje ak ebèjman (They often provide food and lodging)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...viv ak fe benevola nan yon peyi etranje, se yo bon mwayen pou...gonfle yon bidjè pou kapab pwolonje yon sejou yon kote anpil travay ofri lojman ak manje ak yon ti salè.""  This translates to ""...living and volunteering in a foreign country is a good way to...inflate a budget to be able to extend a stay where many jobs offer housing and food with a small salary.""

Therefore, the key advantage for a budget traveler is that volunteer work often provides food and lodging.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki ta ka konsidere kòm abityèl nan vwayaj mwayen nan Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Pase tout vwayaj la sou pwopriyete Disney a**.

The passage states: ""Visit """"tipik"""" la siyifi pran avyon nan ayewopò entènasyon Òlando, pou ale nan bis nan yon otèl Disney sou plas, pase **anviwon yon semèn san kite pwopriyete Disney an** epi rantre lakay ou."" This clearly indicates that staying on Disney property for the duration of the trip is considered typical.
"
Kilès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki konsène Walt Disney World ki pa verite?,"The correct answer is **A: Tikè pou antre nan pak yo ka transfere bay lòt vwayajè**

The text explicitly states: ""tike yo pa transferab"" which means the tickets cannot be transferred. Therefore, option A is false.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **B: Genyen yon ebèjman sou sit la ki disponib** - The text mentions staying at a Disney hotel.
*   **C: Genyen otobis ki disponib pou transpòte vwayajè yo soti nan èpòt la pou ale nan pwopriyete a** - The text mentions taking a bus from Orlando International Airport to a Disney hotel.
*   **D: Tikè pou plizyè jou yo disponib sou sitwèb vant ozanchè yo** - The text mentions beer being sold online, implying tickets are also being sold on those platforms.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan pwoblèm sa yo ke yo gen plis chans pou pa pale sou yo nan yon klas fòmasyon pwofesyonèl oswa nan piblikasyon yo?","The answer is **A: Sivi nan dezè**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""You can find many books and magazines that talk about survival in wilderness areas, but publications that talk about war zones are few.""  This implies that while wilderness survival is well-documented, war zone survival is not.  Therefore, the course and publications are more likely to cover topics specific to war zones and less likely to cover general wilderness survival like desert survival. The passage specifically mentions first aid and sometimes weapons training as part of the war zone course, further supporting this.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan sijè sa yo ke yo gen plis chans pou pale sou yo nan yon klas fòmasyon pwofesyonèl?","The correct answer is **A: Premye swen (First aid)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the course covers ""anpil premye swen (a lot of first aid)"" and ""pafwa fòmasyon sou zam (sometimes training on weapons).""
* While the course is about ""Anvironman agresif (Hostile environments)"" and is for visiting war zones, the passage emphasizes the practical skills taught, and first aid is specifically mentioned as a key component.
* The passage notes a lack of resources specifically about war zones, suggesting broader skills like first aid are more likely to be covered comprehensively.
* The other options, while related, are less directly emphasized as core components of the training as described in the passage.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki pi bon opsyon ki gen pou evite dlo ki potansyèlman kontamine?","The correct answer is **B: Achte dlo nan boutèy**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Efikasite filtraj yo varye epi si ou gen yon pwoblèm, ou dwe anvizaje achte dlo ou nan yon boutèy ki fèmen nan yon sosyete ki gen non."" This directly recommends buying bottled water when there's a concern about water contamination and filtration isn't reliable.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* or only solution:

* **A: Bouyi dlo pandan plizyè minit:**  The passage says the required boiling time varies depending on the region, implying it's not a universal, guaranteed solution.
* **C: Bouyi dlo pandan yon minit:** The passage explicitly states that boiling for one minute *may not be* sufficient in all situations.
* **D: Evalye dlo a pou chèche menas presi:** While testing is good, the passage doesn't present it as a reliable or readily available solution for *avoiding* contaminated water. It focuses more on when filtration might be ineffective.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, kisa ki ka prèske enposib menm pou najè ki konpetan yo?","The correct answer is **C: Naje kont yon kouran**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Majorite ka lanmò rive akòz fatig pandan yap eseye naje kont kouran an, sa ki ka parèt enposib."" (Most deaths occur due to fatigue while trying to swim against the current, which can seem impossible.)

While the other options are mentioned, the passage highlights the difficulty of swimming against the current as a major cause of fatalities, even for competent swimmers.
"
Kisa ou ta dwe fè si ou vin kwense nan yon kouran?,"The correct answer is **C: Naje nan direksyon opoze a** (Swim in the opposite direction).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the most dangerous thing is fighting the current.
* The passage also says that to escape a current, you should try to swim in the opposite direction of the current.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eseye soti nan kouran an pandan w ap vize yon lòt direksyon, apresa naje pou tounen nan rivaj la nòmalman** (Try to get out of the current while aiming for another direction, then swim back to shore normally) - While aiming for another direction is part of the solution, the immediate action is to get *out of* the current, which means swimming against it.
* **B: Naje pi vit kont kouran an** (Swim faster against the current) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage advises and would be exhausting and dangerous.
* **D: Naje anba sifas la** (Swim underwater) - This might offer temporary relief but doesn't address escaping the current and could be risky.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, nan ki lye vizit nan yon chato ka yon ekskisyon vakans ki enteresan?","The correct answer is **C: Nan Valè Rhine nan**.

The passage specifically mentions ""vizite chato nan vale Loire la, vale Rhin an..."" which directly points to the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley as places to visit castles.
"
"Dapre pasaj la, kilès nan konsèy sa yo ke yo pa rekòmande pou vwayajè fanm yo vwayaje nan zòn nan?","The correct answer is **A: Evite diskite sou eta sivil**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly recommends women *declare* they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.** This directly contradicts the idea of avoiding discussion of marital status.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dwe konnen ke diferans kiltirèl yo kapab sisite konpòtman fòse lokal yo:** The passage *does* mention this as a potential issue, advising women to be firm in their decisions.
* **C: Evite mete bijou ki twò parèt:**  The passage advises bringing a ring, but cautions against expensive ones.  This is related to cultural differences regarding potential misunderstandings, not about avoiding flashy jewelry in general.
* **D: Itilize fèmti lè sa nesesè:** While the passage doesn't specifically mention ""fèmt"", it does advise women to be firm and not back down, which implies they should defend themselves if necessary.

Therefore, the only statement the passage *doesn't* recommend is avoiding discussions about marital status (because they are encouraged to declare a marital status).
"
"Selon zòn ki dekri nan pasaj la, kisa ki t ap yon konsèy ki itil pou vwayajè fanm yo?","The correct answer is **D: Nan ka avans ki endezirab, dwe fèm lè w ap refize gason.**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Fòk ou fèm nan refize gason, epi pa janm pè kanpe sou desizyonw (diferans kiltirèl ou pa, sa pa vle di li ok)."" This directly translates to ""You must make the woman refuse the man, and never be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rekonèt ke se pa yon bagay ki kouran pou yon moun swiv yo:** The passage doesn't say anything about following people.
* **B: Mete gwo bag pou montre eta sivil yo:** While the passage *does* recommend bringing a ring, it specifically says ""but not a ring that costs too much."" It's not about wearing a *large* ring.
* **C: Konprann ke diferans kiltirèl yo sijere pou ou evite defann ou:** The passage *strongly* advises against avoiding defending yourself. It says to stand your ground.



"
"Dapre pasaj la, ki senaryo ki ta ka mande yon fotografi lavi sovaj pou itilize yon lantiy espesyalize?","The correct answer is **A: Si y ap fè foto ti kreyati yo sitou (If you are photographing small creatures especially)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""bagay yo tankou yon bann zwazo oswa yon zwilit kreyati gen bezwen lòt objetif yo (things like birdlife or small creatures need other lenses)."" This indicates that photographing smaller subjects requires specialized lenses beyond a general telephoto lens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Si y ap itilize foto yo pou rezon komèsyal (If you are using the photos for commercial reasons):** The passage mentions that national parks may have rules for commercial photography, but it doesn't directly link this to needing a specialized lens.
* **C: Si bèt y ap fè foto yo a timid (If the animals being photographed are timid):** Animal timidity doesn't necessarily dictate the need for a specialized lens. A skilled photographer can work with timid animals using various lenses.
* **D: Si yon pak genyen règ espesyal konsènan fotografi animalye (If a park has special rules regarding wildlife photography):**  Park rules are about *how* you photograph, not *what* lens you need.



"
Kilès nan sa yo ki pa mansyone nan pasaj la kòm yon defi potansyèl pou fotografi lavi sovaj yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Chèche tip lantiy ki nesesè yo (Seeking the necessary lens types)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions needing a telephoto lens and sometimes other lenses (like a bird or wildlife creator's zoom). Therefore, seeking the right lenses *is* mentioned as a challenge.
* The passage explicitly mentions encountering exotic animals, aggressive animals, and working in potentially hostile environments as challenges.

Therefore, the only option *not* mentioned is searching for the right lens types.
"
Kilès nan sa yo ki t ap gen plis posiblite pou lakoz mwens pwoblèm pou yon chofè k ap vwayaje nan kwen mòn yo?,"The correct answer is **B: Fèb fwotman (Weak friction)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sou wout ki gen glas ak nèj yo, fwotman an fèb epi ou kapab kondi tankou ou te sou asfalt ki pa gen anyen sou li."" (On roads with ice and snow, friction is weak and you can drive as if you were on asphalt with nothing on it.)

Therefore, weak friction is the condition that makes driving *easier* (less problematic) in icy and snowy conditions, *provided* the driver is cautious and adjusts their driving accordingly.  The other options present challenges:

* **Gwo trafik (Heavy traffic):**  Heavy traffic is a problem regardless of road conditions.
* **Twòp kondansasyon (Too much condensation):**  Condensation contributes to reduced visibility.
* **Rediksyon nan viziblite (Reduced visibility):** Reduced visibility is dangerous and makes driving more difficult.



"
Kisa ki gen plis posiblite pou rete regilye nan kesyon taks sou revni nan divès peyi?,"The best answer is **B: Estrikti**. Here's why:

* **Structure (Estrikti):** The overall structure of a country's tax system (how income is categorized, deductions are applied, etc.) is the most fundamental element affecting tax compliance. Understanding the structure helps taxpayers navigate the system and ensure they are fulfilling their obligations correctly.  A well-defined and transparent structure reduces ambiguity and makes it easier to comply.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Rate (Tarif):** Tax rates are important, but they are just one component of the overall tax system. Knowing the rate doesn't guarantee compliance if you don't understand how it's applied within the structure.
* **Where you make the deposit (Kote ou fè depozisyon an):** While the location of deposits can impact tax obligations, it's not the primary factor for overall tax compliance. It's more specific to certain types of income or investments.
* **Tax brackets (Tranch taks yo):** Tax brackets are related to rates, and while they're important, they are part of the broader structure of the tax system.

**Therefore, understanding the overall structure of the tax system is the most crucial factor for staying compliant across different countries.**

"Dapre pasaj la, si w ap travay aletranje men ou rete yon lòt kote, kikote ou gen plis posiblite pou deklare taks sou revni ou yo?","The correct answer is **A: Nenpòt kote ou rete òdinèman**.

Here's why:

The passage states that diplomats generally must declare income tax to the country where they are based. It also mentions that tax systems vary by country, and some countries have federal and local taxes.  Crucially, it emphasizes the tax obligations are tied to where you are *based*, not necessarily where you work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ozetazini (United States):** The passage mentions the US as an example of a country with federal and local taxes, but it doesn't suggest the US is the *only* place someone working abroad must declare taxes.
*   **C: Nan peyi kote w ap travay kounya a (In the country where you are currently working):** While this might be a factor, the primary responsibility is to the country of residence.
*   **D: Nenpòt kote frè a mwens (Anywhere the tax is lower):** Tax avoidance is generally illegal and not the focus of the passage. The passage focuses on where tax obligations are based, not on minimizing tax liability.

Kiyès nan deklarasyon sa yo ki pa dekri kòrèkteman yon Fwar Mondyal?,"The correct answer is **D: Peyi yo pa gen obligasyon pou patisipe**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Peyi ki patisipan prezante ekspozisyon atistik ak edikatif yo nan paviyon nasyonal yo..."" This implies participation is *voluntary*, not obligatory.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Afichaj ki ta ka montre istwa oswa kilti yon peyi:** The text explicitly states countries showcase their culture and history.
* **B: Afichaj botanik yo prezante akote afichaj atistik ak edikatif yo:** The text mentions the ""Ekspozisyon entènasyonal òtikiltiral"" specifically presents flower displays, botanical gardens, etc., alongside other exhibits.
* **C: Evènman yo ka dire jiska sis mwa:**  The text clearly states ""Manifestasyon sa yo dire nòmalman ant twa ak sis mwa.""



"
Kilès nan sa yo ki se yon règ nan yon Fwa Mondyal oswa nan yon Ekspozisyon Entènasyonal?,"The correct answer is **B: Menm peyi a pa ka òganize evènman yo chak ane.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Manifestasyon sa yo dire nòmalman ant twa ak sis mwa epi dewoule sou sit ki gen pou pi piti 50 ekta."" This implies that organizing a World Expo/International Exhibition is a significant undertaking that isn't feasible every year for the same country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Afichaj yo dwe montre alafwa istwa yon peyi ak pwoblèm monn lan:** The text *does* say countries present exhibitions to highlight global issues *or* their culture and history, so this is true.
* **C: Evènman yo dwe dire jiska sis mwa:** The text states they *normally* last between three and six months, making this true.
* **D: Pou fwa a kapab òganize, tout peyi yo dwe patisipe:** The text doesn't say that *all* countries must participate for the event to be possible. It's a major event, but participation isn't a prerequisite for its existence.

"Nan aksyon sa yo, kilès ki t ap diminye pwobablite pou atak animal fèt?","The best answer is **C: Konsève yon distans 25 mèt lwen lou yo (Maintain a distance of 25 meters from the animals).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Plizyè dizèn vizitè blese paske yon kenbe yon distans ki pa sifi."" (Several dozen visitors are injured because they keep insufficient distance).  Maintaining a distance directly addresses this risk.
* **The passage warns about attracting animals with odors:**  ""Evite transpòte oswa kwit manje ki gen odè yo epi kenbe tant ou an pwòp."" (Avoid transporting or cooking smelly food and keep your tent clean). While related, this is more about *preventing* attracting animals, not directly reducing the *probability of an attack* when already in the animal's vicinity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Transpò plant awomatik (Transport aromatic plants):** This might *deter* some animals, but it's not a guaranteed way to prevent attacks, and the passage doesn't mention it as a primary safety measure.
* **B: Retire fatra nan yon sit kanpin (Remove trash from a campsite):** This is important for *avoiding attracting* animals, but it doesn't directly reduce the likelihood of an attack if you encounter an animal.
* **D: Detounen atansyon bèt yo ak rès manje (Distract the animals with leftover food):**  **This is the *worst* option.** The passage *explicitly warns against* this (""Evite transpòte oswa kwit manje ki gen odè yo..."").  Trying to distract animals with food would almost certainly *increase* the risk of an attack.



Therefore, maintaining a safe distance is the most direct action to reduce the probability of an animal attack, based on the information provided in the passage.
"
Kilès nan sa yo ki pa mansyone nan pasaj la kòm yon koz pou atak bèt lavi sovaj yo?,"The correct answer is **C: Nouri bèt yo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that visitors get injured because they don't maintain a sufficient distance and that feeding animals is not allowed.
* The passage mentions that strong odors attract animals, but it doesn't say that *feeding* is the direct cause of attacks. It implies that the odors *associated with feeding* are the problem.
* The passage emphasizes that the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.

Therefore, feeding the animals is the one option not directly mentioned as a cause of attacks in the passage.
