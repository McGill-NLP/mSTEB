"Segun iti mabasa, ania koma ti maikonsiderar a saan a nakanatad a singasing tapno sibaballigi a makatokar iti akordion?","The correct answer is **D: Nayonam ti pardas ti panagaramatmo kadagiti yubuyoban tapno manayonan ti pigsana.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kung usarem ti akordion, tapno manayonam ti pigsana, usarem dagiti yubuyoban nga adda nayonna a pigsa wenno pardas.""  This translates to: ""If you use the accordion, to maintain your posture, use the bellows that have their own pressure or bellows.""

Option D directly reflects this instruction.  The other options are related to playing the accordion but don't specifically address maintaining posture and preventing strain *specifically* related to the bellows/pressure.
"
"No agtokar iti akordion, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti makatulong tapno manayonan ti pigsana?","The correct answer is **C: Basbassit a presion (Light pressure)**.

Here's why:

* **The original text emphasizes avoiding excessive force on the keys.** It specifically compares it to playing the piano and suggests that accordion players should use the bellows to maintain pressure.
* **""Basbassit a presion"" (Light pressure)** directly aligns with this advice.  Applying too much pressure is what leads to fatigue.
* **Ad-adu a pardas (Many bellows)** and **Ad-adu a talmeg (Many keys)** are not directly related to preventing fatigue; they relate to playing ability.
* **Basbassit a garaw ti ramramay (Short playing time)** is a preventative measure, but not a direct technique for maintaining stamina *while* playing.

Therefore, the best answer reflecting the text's advice is **C**.



"
Apay a puted dagiti beddeng ti ladawan a makitam iti telebision?,"The correct answer is **B: Tapno maakkuban ti ladawan ti sibubukel nga screen.**

The provided text explicitly states that overscan is done so that ""the image is fully contained within the screen."" This means edges of the picture might be cropped to avoid black bars. Options A, C, and D are incorrect based on the text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a problema ti mapasamak no mangi-convert iti pelikula ti format ti DVD?","The correct answer is **A: Ladawan a saan maakkuban ti sibubukel nga screen** and **B: Puted a paset a subtitulo**.

The question states that overscan causes the image to be cropped at the top, bottom, and on both sides.  It also mentions that subtitles at the bottom can be cut off.  Therefore, both A and B are correct consequences of overscan during DVD conversion.

While ""D: Puted a bedbeddeng"" might be *possible* as a side effect, it's not the primary or direct problem described related to overscan.  The core issue is the loss of image and subtitle information.
"
Sadinno ti pasakarakan ti garison ti Briton?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The passage states: ""Itugot ni Heneral James Ewing ti 700 a militia a bumallasiw iti karayan idiay Trenton Ferry, samsamenda ti rangtay iti rabaw ti Assunpink Creek ken lapdanda dagiti kalaban a tropa a makatalaw.""  It also says, ""Mangisayangkat ni Heneral John Cadwalder iti panagraut a mangisiasi kontra kadagiti garison ti Briton iti Bordentown..."" This indicates that the British garrison was located in Bordentown.
"
Akinpirma iti nagparang idiay insurat ti ima a draft?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The passage states: ""Iti agpatnag iti 150 agingga iti 200 a kopia ti naaramid, maaw-awagan ita a “Dunlap broadsides”. Ti umuna a panagbasa para iti publiko ti dokumento ket inaramid ni John Nixon idiay paraangan ti Independence Hall idi July 8.

Dagiti 25 a Dunlap broadside nga am-ammo nga adda pay laeng isuda dagiti kadadaanan a nakalasat a kopia ti dokumento. Saan a nakalasat ti orihinal a kopia a naisurat iti ima. The passage also states: **""Iti agpatnag iti 150 agingga iti 200 a kopia ti naaramid, maaw-awagan ita a “Dunlap broadsides”.

"Manipud kadagiti sumaganad a lokasion, sadinno iti naudi a nakadanonan ti Dunlap broadside?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The passage states: ""Maysa a kopia ti nakadanon iti London idi Agosto 10."" (One copy was sent to London on August 10th.)
"
Sadinno ti kinapuestoan dagiti tropa ni Koronel Stark?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti amianan a pungto, iti ayan ti alad**.

The passage states: ""Ni tao ni Stark iti ayan ti alad iti amianan a pungto ti ayan dagiti Colonista."" (Stark's men were positioned on the ridge on the northern point of the Colonists' land.)
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano nga inatiddagan dagiti tropa ni Stark ti alad?","The correct answer is **A: Bayat ti panangayab ti Colonist kadagiti tumulong**.

The text states: ""Ni Ti Colonist, makitana dagitoy nga aktibidad, ket nangayab metten kadagiti tumulong. Mairaman kadagiti tropa a mangpappapigsa kadagiti paabante a posision ti umuna ken maikatlo a rehimento ti New Hampshire nga addaan 200 a buyot, iti babaen da Koronel John Stark ken Koronel James Reed...""

This indicates that the troops of Stark were positioned *while* the Colonists were seeking help. The text doesn't specify *when* they were positioned relative to other events.

Options B, C, and D are not supported by the provided text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maysa a kararanggas a panawen iti Tsina?","The correct answer is **D: Panawen iti Tallo a Pagarian**.

The passage explicitly states that the Three Kingdoms period was a very significant time in Chinese history, lasting for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties and characterized by intense warfare for the throne. It emphasizes the large number of deaths during this period. While the other options are periods in Chinese history, the passage highlights the Three Kingdoms period as a particularly significant one.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti pudno dagiti pangen ti kuton nga sumsumrek ti nomadic a tiempo?","The correct answer is **A: Agaramidda ti pagiananda bayat ti rabii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iti nomadic a tiempo, dagiti soldado a kuton ket agmartsai ti rabii ken agsardeng iti aldaw."" (In nomadic times, cotton soldiers marched at night and rested during the day.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bassit ti kasapulanda a makan:** While food availability might have been a factor in nomadic life, the passage doesn't explicitly state that their food needs were minimal.
* **C: Agar-aramidda ti pagiananda a mabaliwan kalpasan ti 17 aldaw:** The passage mentions a 17-day cycle but doesn't connect it to their ability to survive.
* **D: Agmarmartsada bayat ti aldaw:** The passage directly contradicts this, stating they marched at night.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng ti pudno a mangiyanninaw iti ugali dagiti pangen ti kuton bayat ti nomadic a tiempo?","The correct answer is **C: Balbaliwanda ti pagiananda innaldaw.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Iti nomadic a tiempo, dagiti soldado a kuton ket agmartsai ti rabii ken agsardeng iti aldaw."" This directly translates to ""In nomadic times, cotton soldiers marched at night and rested during the day.""  This means their rest cycle *alternated* between night and day, not that they did the same thing every day or used the same location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agar-aramidda ti pagiananda bayat ti rabii** -  While they rested at night, this doesn't describe their *overall* pattern of activity.
* **B: Agmarmartsada ti 17 aldaw nga saanda agaramid ti pagiananda** - This is incorrect. They marched for 17 days *then* rested.
* **D: Usarenda ti agpada nga pagianan bayat ti tiempo** - The text implies they moved and changed locations as part of their nomadic lifestyle.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti agtultuloy latta a mailaksid ti presensia ti nakinruar a signal?,"The correct answer is **C: Orasan a biolohikal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mangtaginayon kadagiti bukbukodna nga oscillator dagiti biolohikal a pagorasan nga agtultuloy iti maysa a panawen nga is-isuna nga agan-andar uray awan ti mangpagaraw."" (Biological clocks persist in a time-keeping manner, continuing to function even without sunlight.)

* **Biological clocks** are the internal mechanisms that generate these rhythmic patterns. They are the fundamental reason why organisms can maintain a regular cycle without external cues.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer, although related:

* **A: Siklo nga endogenous (Endogenous cycle):** This is a broader term referring to internal cycles.  An *orasan a biolohikal* *is* an endogenous cycle, but the clock itself is more specific.
* **B: Ritmo a periodiko (Periodic rhythm):** This describes the *result* of the biological clock, the actual rhythmic pattern. It's not the underlying mechanism.
* **D: Maobserbaran a ritmo (Observable rhythm):** This is the observable manifestation of the periodic rhythm. It's the *result* and not the mechanism.



Therefore, **Orasan a biolohikal** is the most accurate and specific answer because it refers to the internal mechanism that allows organisms to maintain rhythmic patterns *independent* of external signals.



"
Ania a termino ti mangiladawan kadagiti indibidual a mangipakita ti nadumaduma a klase ti phenotypic a galad?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** describes a population where individuals exhibit a variety of different phenotypes (observable characteristics) for a particular trait. This directly aligns with the question describing individuals with different classes of the primary phenotypic trait.
* **Monomorphic** describes a population where individuals have the same phenotype for a particular trait, which is the opposite of what the question asks.
* **Organisms** and **Population** are general terms and don't specifically describe the variation in phenotypic traits.
* **Sebbangan** refers to the habitat or environment, not the individuals within it.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti husto a termino para iti organismo a sumakop ti partikular a lugar?,"The correct answer is **B: Populasion**.

Here's why:

* **Populasion:**  The definition provided in the question states that a population is a collection of organisms of the same species in a particular place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:** This describes a population where individuals have the same phenotype (same appearance).
* **Sebbangan:** This refers to a habitat or a specific location where organisms live. It's not the organisms themselves.
* **Polymorphic:**  This describes a population where individuals have different phenotypes.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a pagarigan dagiti aktibidad ti nature-based tourism?,"The correct answer is **A: Panaguli ti dissuor (Fishing with explosives)**.

Here's why:

* **Nature-based tourism** focuses on experiencing and appreciating natural environments responsibly.
* **Panaguli ti dissuor** is a destructive fishing method that harms the ecosystem and is the opposite of responsible nature tourism. 
* **Panaglitrato dagiti sabong ti atap (Photographing rooftop tiles)** is irrelevant to nature tourism.
* **Panagbisita ti museo a ciencia (Visiting a science museum)**, while educational, isn't inherently a nature-based activity. However, it could *complement* nature tourism.
* **Panagbanniit (Hiking)** is a common and acceptable activity within nature-based tourism.



Therefore, **Panaguli ti dissuor** is the only option that doesn't fit the theme of responsible nature tourism.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pagbasaran ti sistema ti pagluganan?","The correct answer is **B: Pribado a lugan**.

The text explicitly states: ""...a sistema ti transportasion a naibasar kadagiti pribado a lugan."" ( ...a transportation system based on private vehicles.)
"
Dagiti partikulo a mangparparikus iti nucleus ket addaan ti ania a kuryente?,"The correct answer is **A: Positibo a kuryente**.

The passage states: ""Dagiti proton ket adda ti positibo a kuryente ngem ti neutron ket awan."" (Protons have positive charge, while neutrons have none.)
"
Ti nucleus ket addaan ti ania a kadagiti partikulo?,"The correct answer is **A: Protons ken neutrons**.

The text explicitly states: ""Addaan dua a partikulo ti nukleo - dagiti neutron ken dagiti proton."" (The nucleus has two particles - neutrons and protons.)
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pagarigan ti lima a bit a binary a numero?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **Binary numbers** are made up of only 0s and 1s.
* **Five-bit binary numbers** have five digits.

Let's examine each option:

* **A: 1010** - This is a four-bit number, not five.
* **B: 12001** - This includes the digit '2', which is not a valid binary digit.
* **C: 10010** - This is a five-bit number consisting only of 0s and 1s.
* **D: 110101** - This is a six-bit number, not five.

Therefore, only option C satisfies both conditions: being a valid binary number and having five digits."
Ti binary a digit ket maawagan met laeng nga?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

The passage explicitly states: ""dagiti binary a digit, wenno **bits**, no usaren ti panagsarsarita a para iti kompiuter."" This directly links binary digits to the term ""bits.""
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nadakamat iti mabasa kas maysa a kangrunaan a benepisio ti blogging?,"The correct answer is **B: Panagbassit ti kritisismo gapo iti kakadua** (Simplifying criticism due to peers).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that blogging allows students to be ""nabagas ken nasayaat ti pannakaisuratna ket maliklikan ti pakadillawan"" (becomes more fluent and improves their writing skills and avoids mistakes) because others will read or see their work. This directly addresses the improvement of grammar and writing ability.
* The text mentions blogging helps students ""agbalin a nasirib panggep iti aglikmut a lubong kadakuada"" (become more aware of the world around them) and provides an ""alikamen iti panagtinnulong"" (tool for learning), but doesn't specifically link it to *simplifying criticism from peers*.
* While blogging *can* increase knowledge, that's not presented as a primary benefit in the text.
* The text touches on the potential for blogging to encourage critical and analytical thinking, but it doesn't state that it *manages* or *ensures* a consistent drive to continue learning.

Therefore, the other options are either directly supported by the text or not the *primary* benefit highlighted. Option B is the one *not* directly supported.
"
Ania kadagit sumaganad nga aspeto ti blogging ti nadakamat a mangtingnay ti estudiante tapno mapasayaat dagiti panagsuratda?,"The correct answer is **A: Aktibo a panangsungbat kadagiti materiales iti internet.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states:  ""**mabalin a mangpapigsa kadagiti estudiante tapno agbalinda a kritikal ken analitikal; babaen iti aktibo a panangsungbat kadagiti material iti Internet, maikkan kaipapanan dagiti estudiante dagiti posisionda iti konteksto ti sinurat dagiti sabali ken kasta met a maiparangda ti bukodda a perspektibo kadagiti partikular nga isyu**"" (Oravec, 2002).

This directly links active engagement with online materials to developing critical and analytical skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ti guyugoy a maliklikan ti kritisismo:** While feedback is important, the passage doesn't focus on the *ability to handle criticism* specifically as a benefit of blogging.
* **C: Panagmentenar ti interes dagiti dum-dumngeg:**  Keeping the audience interested is mentioned as a *goal* of blogging, but not a direct *benefit* to the student's writing skills.
* **D: Kasapulan ti panagtinnulong:** The passage mentions blogging as a form of learning and resource, but not the *need for help* as a direct benefit to writing.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti benepisio ti agsisinnublat a pannakisarita para kadagiti estudiante? ,"The correct answer is **B: Inaldaw a panagsasango iti mangisursuro iti uray ania nga oras iti aldaw.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mabalin met a mangted dagiti estudiante kadagiti salsaludsod para kadagiti mangisursuro iti uray ania nga oras iti aldaw ket namnamaenda ti napartak a pannakasungbat, imbes nga agurayda agingga iti sumaruno a panagsasango."" (Students can turn to instructors at any time of the day via forums, and they can expect prompt responses instead of waiting until the next class.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti panagusar iti Internet kas maysa a rekurso:** While the passage mentions the internet, it's not the *primary* benefit being highlighted in relation to students. It's a tool *enabling* the benefit of 24/7 access.
* **C: Nalap-it nga oras ti panagtrabaho:** The passage says there are only minor restrictions on work schedules, so it doesn't necessarily lead to shorter working hours.
* **D: Kontol iti addang:** The passage doesn't mention anything about controlling workload.

Therefore, the most direct and supported benefit in the passage is the ability for students to access learning resources and get help at any time of the day."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga aspeto ti agsisinnublat a pannakisarita ti saan a nawaywaya para kadagiti estudiante?","The correct answer is **B: Oras iti trabaho (Work schedule)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kanayunanna pay, adda laeng sumagmamano a restriksion ket agbalinto met laeng a nawaywaya ti eskediulmo iti trabaho.""  This translates to: ""Furthermore, there are only a few restrictions that only become flexible regarding the work schedule.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panangpanpanunot (Following instructions):** The text mentions the importance of students being able to follow instructions.
* **C: Instruksional a materiales (Instructional materials):** The text states the internet provides access to instructional materials.
* **D: Panagusar iti Internet (Use of the Internet):** The text highlights the benefit of using the internet and World Wide Web.



"
Ania ti saan a nadakamat iti mabasa a mainaig ti mediebal a kastilio?,"The correct answer is **A: Pagbaludan (Fortification)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the *inspiration* of medieval castles from imagination and Arthurian legends.** It highlights the aesthetic and symbolic aspects (battles, feasts, chivalry, legends).
* **The question asks what is *not* well-documented in written sources about medieval castles.**  While there's plenty of literature about the *stories* surrounding castles, details about their *actual construction and defensive features* are often lacking or incomplete in written records.  Scholars often piece together information from archaeological evidence.
* **Options B, C, and D are all aspects that *are* well-documented in medieval literature and historical records.**  We have countless stories of battles, feasts, and chivalry, and we know a lot about knights.

Therefore, the lack of detailed documentation concerning the specific fortification details (how castles were actually built to defend against attack) makes ""Pagbaludan"" the correct answer.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nadakamat iti mabasa nga angot wenno uni a mapanunot dagiti rebba iti kastilio?,"The correct answer is **B: Buteng**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about sounds and smells *not* recorded in written accounts.**
* **Buteng (stench/foul odor)** is a smell that wouldn't be explicitly detailed in written historical records. While written accounts might mention sanitation issues or general unpleasantness, the specific, pervasive smell of a medieval castle would likely be overlooked.
* **Gubgubat (battles/fighting), Bangkete (banquets), and Kuko (nails)** are all things that *could* potentially be documented or alluded to in written or artistic representations, even if not in detail.

Therefore, the answer that best fits the prompt is **Buteng**.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a panangiladawan ti Kastilo ti Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **B: Kasapulanna ti minimal a panangdepensa gapo iti nakappia a pagilian idi panawen ti panangipatakder.**

The text states that ""Idi 1480s, idi inrugi nga inpatakder ni Lord Hastings daytoy, ti pagilian ket nakappia ken masapul laeng ii depensa kontra kadagiti babassit a grupo ti agsursursor a marauders.""  This means the need for strong defenses was minimal due to the political climate at the time.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti napupuskol a pader ti kastilio ket dinawat ni Lord Hastings:** While the walls were likely substantial, the passage emphasizes the *lack* of need for strong walls due to the political situation.
* **C: Ti panangipatakder ti kastilio ket saan a kadawyan ti panawen:** The passage doesn't discuss the unusual nature of the castle's construction.
* **D: Inpatakder daytoy tapno makabael a mangdaer iti mabayag iti determinado a panangraut:** This is the opposite of what the text says. The castle wasn't built for heavy defense because the political climate didn't require it.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a langa ti panangipatakder ti saan a kadawyan ti Kastilo ti Kirby Muxloe bayat ti panawen a nailadawan iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **A: Dadakkel a tawa**.

The passage states: ""Kas gagangay idi a panawen, ti Kastilo ti Kirby Muxloe ket ad-adda a nausar kas nasarikedkedan a balay imbes a kas agpaypayso a kastilo. **Dadakkel a nasileng a tawa** ken naiingpis a paderna, saan a makabael a mangdaer iti mabayag iti maysa a determinado a panangraut.""  This directly indicates that the large towers were a prominent feature and contributed to its use as a residence, not a fortress.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Adigi nga inpatakder tapno makabael a mangdaer iti mabayag a panangraut:** The passage explicitly says the castle wasn't built to withstand determined sieges.
* **C: Basbassit ti panangdepensana ti dadduma a kastilio:** The passage doesn't compare its defenses to other castles.
* **D: Naiingpis a pader:** While the passage mentions elegant walls, it's the large towers that are highlighted as a key characteristic and reason for its non-fortress nature.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kaaduanna a makagunggona para iti agsagsagana a managtaray para iti umay nga panawen?","The correct answer is **D: Panagsanay iti gym para iti akingngato a bagi**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""Siempre ta maysa primera klase a tumataray iti kaguadua-milia, masapul nga addaan iti patas a kaadu ti kinapegges, ngem masapul a mataraken ti kinaandur iti amin a pagpeggadan. Ti sumagmamano a panagtaray a cross country no tiempo ti lam-ek, **a makaduaan iti panagsanay iti gymnasium para iti akingngato a bagi**, ti kasayaatan a panagsagana para iti panawen ti panagtaray."" This directly links gym training for strength to improved performance during the off-season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagsanay ti cross country a panagtaray no tiempo ti kalgaw:** While cross country is important, the text focuses on gym training *when the weather is bad* (off-season).
* **B: Agperreng ti panagsukog ti kinapardas bayat ti panagsanay:** The text says strength is needed, but it doesn't emphasize weightlifting specifically *during* regular cross country training.
* **C: Parmeken ti tallo a minuto nga oras:**  The text mentions being able to run a 3-minute mile as a goal, but it doesn't say achieving that pace is the key to off-season improvement.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kapatgan para iti managtaray a first-class ti kagudua ti milia?","The correct answer is **A: Panagsanay ti cross country a panagtaray bayat ti bulan ti lam-ek**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Siempre ta maysa primera klase a tumataray iti kaguadua-milia, maysa a tao a makaparmek iti dua a minuto, masapul nga addaan iti patas a kaadu ti kinapegges, ngem masapul a mataraken ti kinaandur iti amin a pagpeggadan. Ti sumagmamano a panagtaray a cross country no tiempo ti lam-ek, a makaduaan iti panagsanay iti gymnasium para iti akingngato a bagi, ti kasayaatan a panagsagana para iti panawen ti panagtaray."" This translates to: ""Of course, a first-class 2-mile runner, someone who can run in two minutes, needs a fair amount of stamina, but also needs to endure all the pounding.  Some cross country training in the off-season, with training in the gym for my own sake, is a good preparation for the running season.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sukogen ti kinaibtur ngem ti kinapardas** (Focus on stamina but not pounding): The passage emphasizes the importance of enduring the ""pounding"" or impact of running.
* **C: Ag-clock in iti nababbaba ngem dua a minuto** (Clocking in under two minutes):  While being able to run under two minutes is a benchmark, the passage focuses on training methods.
* **D: Sukogen ti kinapardas ngem ti kinaibtur** (Focus on stamina but not pounding): Same reason as option B.



"
"Para iti atleta, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maragpat gapu laeng ti nutrisional a kababalin?","The correct answer is **A: Nasaysayaat a panangaramid (Good technique)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that good technique is essential to prevent negative impacts of training and maintain the overall health of an athlete. While nutrition (hydration and overall habits) is important, the passage explicitly links ""nasaysayaat a panangaramid"" (good technique) to preventing negative consequences of training, beyond just nutritional deficiencies. 

The other options are related to outcomes of training but are not the primary focus of what the passage identifies as needing to be maintained *beyond* nutritional balance.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga isingasing a wagas tapno makasapul dagiti ubbing nga atleta ti nayon a rag-o iti ay-ayamda?","The correct answer is **D: Imentenar ti balanse ti nasalun-at a pigsa (Maintain a balanced mental state)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ti panangmantenir ti balanse ti nasalun-at a pigsa...makatulong kadagiti agay-ayam a paimbagen ti magapuanan ken manayunan ti rag-oda iti dayta nga ay-ayam."" (Maintaining a balanced mental state...helps young athletes to develop potential and manage their performance in that area.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Panagsanay ti nasayaat a nutrision (Proper nutrition training):** While important, the passage only mentions ""epektibo nga ugali nga uminom ti danum"" (effective habit of drinking water) as related to nutrition, not comprehensive nutrition training.
* **B: Agtuloytuloy ti elite a lebel ti panangaramid (Continuing at an elite performance level):** The passage focuses on mental balance, not necessarily maintaining a high level of athletic performance.
* **C: Epektibo nga uminom ti danum (Drinking water effectively):** This is mentioned as a habit related to nutrition, but not a core element of mental balance as highlighted in the passage.



Therefore, only maintaining a balanced mental state is directly and prominently mentioned as a way to help young athletes manage their performance according to the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, apay a gumatang ti middle distance a managtaray ti nanginngina a produkto?","The correct answer is **D: Adda ti saan nga umisu a panangipapan dagiti saan unay a nangina a produkto.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saabangan a nangina nga sport ti middle distance a panagtaray; nupay kasta, adu dagiti saan nga umisu a panangipapan iti sumagmamano nga alikamen a kasapulan tapno makasali."" This translates to: ""Middle distance running is considered an elite sport; however, there are many non-specialized products required to participate.""  And later, ""Mabalin a marikna dagiti atleta a kaykayatda ti maysa a produkto uray awan ti agpayso a benepisiona daytoy."" which means ""It can be seen that athletes want a product even if it doesn't offer any benefit.""

This indicates that there's a demand for these products (even if they aren't necessarily effective) because there aren't specialized products readily available.  Option D directly reflects this lack of specialized products.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isu ti maipangpangrunada:** The passage doesn't say it's because of a popular trend.
*   **B: Adda ti agpayso a benepisona:** The passage explicitly states that *many* of these products *don't* offer any benefit.
*   **C: Dakkel unay ti epektona iti panangaramidda:** The passage doesn't mention a significant impact on performance.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan iti middle distance a panagtaray?","The correct answer is **A: Adu a produkto (Many products)**.

The passage states: ""Saabangan a nangina nga sport ti middle distance a panagtaray; nupay kasta, adu dagiti saan nga umisu a panangipapan iti sumagmamano nga alikamen a kasapulan tapno makasali."" This translates to: ""Middle distance running has become popular; however, many people are unaware of the numerous equipment required to participate.""

Therefore, the passage emphasizes the **many products** needed, not necessarily specific types of products or a large amount of money. Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the text.
"
Asinno ti nakadiskubre ti nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch ken Purcell**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti MRI ket naibasar iti pisika a maawagan iti nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a nadiskubre idi dekada 1930 da Felix Bloch (agtrabtrabaho iti Stanford University) ken Edward Purcell (manipud iti Harvard University).""
"
Iti ania a tawen a naikkan ti kaunaan a patente para ti medical imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

The passage states: ""Kalpasan ti uppat a tawen, naikkan iti patente, ket dayta ti kaunaan a patente iti intero a lubong iti tay-ak ti MRI. **Iti 1977**, nalpas ni Dr. Damadian ti pannakaaramid iti immuna a “bui a bagi” a MRI scanner...""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti rumbeng a pannakaawat nga addaan koma dagiti tattao tapno mailawlawag dagiti pisikal a paspasamak ti sabali?","The correct answer is **A: Tarigagay (Empathy)**.

The passage explicitly states that the ability to understand the feelings, thoughts, and motivations of others is crucial for solving unclear physical occurrences. It then uses the example of someone being overwhelmed by laughter to illustrate this.  **Empathy** is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.  The other options aren't directly linked to the passage's main point about understanding and interpreting *feelings* as a way to understand physical reactions.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti pannakaawat ti gandat ket tulongan dagiti tattao nga aramiden ti ania?","The correct answer is **A: Ikkaten ti di masigurado iti pisikal a paspasamak**

Here's why:

The text states that reading the ""tattoos"" (which refers to subtle physical cues and expressions) of others helps us understand what might be happening physically. The example given is recognizing when someone is hiding their sadness. This connects to interpreting physical cues to understand what someone might be experiencing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pugtuan ti tarigagay:** While reading emotions *can* help understand someone's feelings, the text's primary focus isn't on *understanding* their emotions but on discerning physical cues.
* **C: Kitaen ti sabali a tattao nga awan ti panangukom:** The text doesn't mention the importance of non-judgmental observation, but rather the ability to *read* and interpret cues.
* **D: Basaen ti panunot ti sabali:**  The text uses the metaphor of ""tattoos"" to describe understanding others, not literally reading minds. It's about interpreting physical cues.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a dagup ti gandat ti AI?","The correct answer is **D: Panag-automate kadagiti trabaho**.

The text states: ""Karaman ti panagsukisok iti AI ti panagaramid kadagiti makina tapno ma-automate dagiti trabaho a kasapulan iti masirib a galad."" (The exploration of AI involves making machines automate tasks that require rapid speed.)

While the other options (Panagplano, Panangkita ti boses, Panangiskediul) are all mentioned as *capabilities* of AI, the core overarching goal and a significant part of its definition, as stated in the text, is automation.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti masansan a mainaig iti AI?","The correct answer is **A: Serbisio para ti kostumer**.

The text explicitly states: ""panangkita ti diagnosis ken damdamag dagiti kustomer"" which translates to ""recognizing diagnosis and feelings of customers"". This directly relates to customer service.

While options B, C, and D are mentioned as applications of AI, customer service is listed more directly as a function of AI in the provided text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pigsa ti maysa a tao nga addaan ti managtitipon a pagpanpanunot?","The correct answer is **D: Agikabesa kadagiti disenio**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti kakapategan a banag kadagitoy a kapanunotan ket: adda laeng maysa a husto a sungbat. Makapanunotka laeng iti dua a sungbat, mainaganan ti husto ken madi. Dagito a klase ti panagpanunot ket mainaig iti dadduma a sensia wenno gagangay a pamay-an. Dagiti tattao nga addaan iti kastoy a klase ti kapanunot nga addaan iti lohikal a panagpampanunot, ket makabael nga **agikabesa kadagiti disenio, mangsolbar kadagiti problema ken agobra kadagiti a sientipiko a panangsubok.**""

Option D directly reflects this capability. The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Panangilasin kaagduduma a husto a sungbat iti maysa a problema** - The passage states there is *only one* correct answer.
* **B: Panagaplikar ti barbaro a pamay-an ti maysa a problema** - The passage highlights logical reasoning, not a ""brute force"" approach.
* **C: In-inut nga usaren ti orasda ti panagsolbar ti problema** - While efficiency might be a byproduct, the primary focus is on logical reasoning and finding the single correct answer.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a pokus ti managtiptipon a pagpanpanunot?","The correct answer is **B: In-inut nga usaren ti orasna**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes **speed, logic, and efficiency** as core focuses of this type of reasoning. While efficiency *can* be related to time, the text doesn't specifically highlight *using time efficiently* as a key aspect.  The other options are explicitly mentioned as important elements:

* **A: Maawat nga adda laeng maysa a husto a sungbat** is a crucial characteristic – it's a deductive reasoning approach.
* **C: Panangilasin iti kinaagpayso** is mentioned as a requirement for explaining the reasoning.
* **D: Panangala iti impormasion** is explicitly stated as part of the process.

Therefore, using time efficiently is not directly addressed as a core focus of this particular reasoning type.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a micro-expression?","The correct answer is **A: Kumitkita iti adayo bayat ti panagsasao (Looking away while speaking)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the speed and subtlety of micro-expressions, happening in milliseconds. Options B, C, and D (facial tics, clenched fists, and hand gestures) are all physical expressions that *could* be part of a micro-expression, or at least indicators of emotional state.  Looking away while speaking is a behavior that doesn't inherently imply a specific, fleeting emotional expression. It's a separate action and doesn't fit the definition of a micro-expression as described in the text.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti interpretasion ti micro-expression ti saan a pudno?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti video recording ket nangituggod kadagiti nagpateg a pannakatakuat.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ti video recording ket nangituggod kadagiti nagpateg a pannakatakuat ti paspasamak ti interpretasion ti micro-expressions..."" This means video recording *hinders* accurate interpretation of micro-expressions due to the speed of events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti husto a panangitarus ket mailasin ti panag-ulbod:** The passage actually suggests the *opposite* – accurate interpretation of micro-expressions *can* reveal emotional states.
* **C: Ti panagsao kas met kadagiti ekspresion ti rupa ket maitarus:** While the passage mentions facial expressions, it focuses on the difficulty in interpreting *micro*expressions.
* **D: Makatulong a sukimaten ti kinapasnek:** The passage doesn't directly state that understanding micro-expressions helps detect deception. It hints at the ability to read emotions, which *could* be relevant to deception detection, but it's not the primary focus.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kapatgan a resulta ti Renaissance? ,"The correct answer is **B: Pannakaiwaras ti pannakaammo (The accumulation of knowledge)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ti pamuspusan tapno makaala ti impormasion ket sabalin."" (The ultimate goal to obtain information is easy.) This implies a focus on acquiring and accumulating information.
* **The text also mentions:** ""ti Renaissance iti napateg a panagbalbaliw iti wagas ti panagsursuro ken iti pannakaiwaras ti pannakaammo."" (the Renaissance had a significant change in the way of teaching and in the accumulation of knowledge.)

The other options are either directly mentioned as a *result* of the changes in attention and memory (like forgetting being linked to attention) or are not as directly tied to the core shift described in the text.  While forgetting and writing are mentioned, the overarching result described is the increased accumulation of knowledge.



"
"Kas resulta ti Renaissance, basbassit ti panangipaganetget iti ania kadagiti sumaganad?","The correct answer is **C: Panaglagip ti surat (Reading)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti kabaelan a makalagip ti surat ket maigapu iti naipamaysa nga atension."" (The ability to read comes from focused attention.)

The question asks what *decreased* as a result of the Renaissance. The passage implies that the ability to read was *enhanced* due to the focus required for interpretation and understanding – a key aspect of the Renaissance's impact on learning and knowledge transmission. Therefore, the initial state of easily forgetting written information was addressed, leading to an improvement in reading skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panaglagip ti maysa (Perception):** The passage doesn't directly address a decrease in perception.
* **B: Panang-ala ti pannakaammo (Acquisition of knowledge):** The Renaissance *improved* the acquisition of knowledge.
* **D: Panangiwaras ti impormasion (Transmission of information):**  The Renaissance significantly *improved* the transmission of information through printing and other innovations.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a mangiyanninaw ti gandat ti panagusar ti internet para ti agtultuloy a pannakirelasion?,"The correct answer is **C: Panagsirarak ti pasiar (Marketing)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""Personal a pannakikadua"" (personal connection) and ""agtultuloy a pannakirelasion"" (sustaining relationships) are *new* aspects of internet use. It doesn't mention marketing or business.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Panagnetwork ti negosio (Business networking):** While business networking is a use of the internet, the passage focuses on *personal* relationships, not business.
*   **B: Agtalinaed a makikomunikar iti pamilia (Staying connected with family):** This *could* relate to sustaining relationships, but the passage highlights a more specific aspect - personal connection.
*   **D: Makiam-ammo kadagiti baro a tattao (Meeting new people):** This *could* also relate to personal connection, and it's closer to the passage's theme than marketing, but it's not as directly aligned.

Therefore, **panagsirarak ti pasiar** is the most clearly unrelated option to the passage's main point about sustaining personal relationships through the internet.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a mangiyanninaw ti gandat ti panagusar ti internet para ti personal a pannakikadua?,"The correct answer is **B: Mangi-post ti online a pagsaritaan (Posting on online forums)**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Personal a pannakikadua"" (Personal interaction) is a *new* aspect of internet use.  Posting on online forums is a direct example of this type of interaction.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Kumita ti recipe (Looking up recipes):** This is a practical use of the internet, but not primarily focused on personal interaction.
*   **C: Panagsirarak ti produkto ti panangtaripato iti salun-at (Selling farm products online):** This is a commercial application, not personal interaction.
*   **D: Mangimaton kadagiti pinansia (Managing finances):**  This is a practical application, but not directly about interpersonal connection.



Therefore, posting on online forums directly aligns with the concept of personal interaction highlighted in the provided text."
Kaano nga insardeng ti lumaud nga Europa iti agpannuray kadagiti impluensia ken nangrugi a mangbukel ti bukodda nga istilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti aglawlaw ti ngudo ti Middle Ages**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nupay kasta, gapu iti nabayag a komunikasion, dagiti istilo iti laod ket mamaudi iti 25 inggana 30 a tawen. **Iti panagleppas ti Middle Ages**, nangrugi a mangbukel ti lumaud nga Europa iti bukodda nga istilo.""

This clearly indicates that the emergence of distinct styles in European fashion happened *after* the Middle Ages. Therefore, the best answer is that it occurred ""iti aglawlaw ti ngudo ti Middle Ages"" (at the end/fall of the Middle Ages).
"
Ti panagusar iti butones a pangiserra iti badbado ket resulta ti ania? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti Krusada**.

The passage states: ""Maysa kadagiti kadadkelan a nagdur-asan iti dayta a panawen a kas resulta dagiti krusada, nangrugi dagiti tattao nga agusar iti butones a pangiserra iti badbado."" This directly links the adoption of buttons on clothing to the Crusades.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maikonsiderar a solusion ti napaut a panawen kadagiti parikut iti aglawlaw?","The correct answer is **C: Ilasin ti puon dagiti parikut**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that a ""temporary solution"" isn't enough and we need to ""see the root of the problems"" and ""address them."" 
* It further mentions that problems are caused by overpopulation and unsustainable lifestyles. 
* Option C, ""Ilasin ti puon dagiti parikut"" (Address the root causes of the problems), directly aligns with this emphasis on tackling the fundamental issues rather than just offering temporary fixes.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Panagboykot kadagiti nangina a keddeng ti panagbiag (Boycott unsustainable lifestyles):** While this is a *part* of addressing the root causes, it's not the *entire* solution the passage advocates for.
* **B: Aktibismo (Activism):**  Activism is a *method* of addressing the problems, but the passage emphasizes the need to *understand* the root causes *before* acting.
* **D: Mannakigayyem iti panaggaraw iti aglawlaw (Embrace solar energy):** This is a positive step, but the passage indicates that focusing *solely* on renewable energy isn't enough to solve the core problems.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a solusion ti saan a maikonsiderar a panangagas ti kaduanna kadagiti parikut iti aglawlaw?","The correct answer is **C: Panangipeksa kadagiti opinion maipanggep dagiti nangina a keddeng ti panagbiag.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the initial approach (""temporario a solusion"") is like ""mangipasimudaag a panangagas ti kaduanna"" (a superficial/superficial treatment of the problem).  It then argues that we need to address the root causes.  

* **A: Makipaset ti aktibismo (Participate in activism):** The passage *does* suggest activism as a way to guide the future.
* **B: Ikkaten dagiti puon ti parikut (Address the root causes):** The passage explicitly states this is the necessary approach.
* **D: Agbiag nga makaay-ayo iti aglawlaw (Live sustainably):**  The passage advocates for this as a way to navigate the future.
* **C: Panangipeksa kadagiti opinion maipanggep dagiti nangina a keddeng ti panagbiag (Examine opinions regarding outdated lifestyles):** While examining opinions might be *part* of understanding the problem, the passage doesn't frame it as a primary *solution* to the core issue of unsustainable living. It focuses more on changing the lifestyles themselves and addressing the underlying factors. It's a less direct solution compared to addressing the root causes or living sustainably.



Therefore, examining opinions about outdated lifestyles isn't presented as a key solution in the passage.



"
Iti ania a nasion ti Europa ti nangimarka ti umuna a gubat a ti pakaseknanna ket ti balanse ti bileg imbes a relihioso ti kontekstona?,"The correct answer is **D: Espania**.

The passage states: ""Naimarka nga umuna a gubat ti Spanish Succession War a ti kangrunaan a pakaseknanna ket ti balanse ti bileg."" (The Spanish Succession War marked the first war whose main objective was the balance of power.) and ""...Naimarkaan daytoy ti napateg a panagbaliw, a dagiti bileg ti Europa ket awananen iti panagpammarang a kas relihioso a gubgubat."" (...It marked a significant shift, where European powers no longer fought with religious motivations.)

The Spanish Succession War was a major conflict in the 18th century, and its primary focus was on the balance of power in Europe. Therefore, Spain is the correct answer.
"
Ania a gubat ti nailadawan kas maudin a gubat kas ‘relihioso a gubat’?,"The correct answer is **A: Tallopulo a Tawen a Gubat**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tallopulo a Tawen a Gubat ti maudin a gubat a maawagan a kas relihioso a gubat."" (The Thirty Years' War is the last war called a religious war.)



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad nga aspeto iti Simbaan Katoliko ti saan a naipasirok iti panangsukimat?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti konsentrasion ti bileg iti uneg ti Simbaan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the concentration of power in the Church, particularly in Rome.**  It questions whether the doctrine of wealth being necessary for governance and control, which justified the Church's wealth, is truly a core tenet of the religion if power is so concentrated.
* **The passage also mentions the Church's ability to unify Europe despite linguistic and cultural differences.** This implies a certain strength and influence.
* **The questions are looking for aspects *not* challenged by the Reformation.** The Reformation specifically targeted the Church's wealth and authority. 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: No ti pannakabingbingay ti kinabaknang ti Simbaan ket naitutop:** This *was* a core target of the Reformation.
* **B: No ti kangrunaan a sursuro ti relihion ket rumbeng a mabaliwan:** While the Reformation challenged interpretations of scripture, it didn't fundamentally deny the core religious beliefs. 
* **D: No ti kangrunaan a sursuro ti Simbaan ket masabet:** The passage suggests the doctrine of wealth being necessary for governing *is* a core teaching, and the Reformation directly challenged this.



Therefore, the concentration of power within the Church is the aspect *least* challenged by the Reformation, according to the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno iti pinatay idiay Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a guardia**.

The passage states: ""…maysa a miembro ti nariribuk nga ummong ti nangitag-ay iti ulo ti guardia ti ari a napapatay idiay Versailles…"" which translates to ""...a member of the angry mob demanded the head of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles...""
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga inpilit ti ummong iti Ari ken Reyna?,"The correct answer is **B: Kellaat a panagruar manipud ti Versailles**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** The mob forced the King and Queen to *exit* the carriages (lukatan dagiti tawa ti karuaheda), meaning they were forced to leave the carriages. 
* **The passage implies:** While the journey *to* Paris was part of the events, it wasn't the act that the mob specifically forced.  The forced action was the exit from the carriages.
* **Options A and C** are directly mentioned in the passage as things the mob did.
* **Option D** describes the overall event (returning to Paris), not the specific act of being forced to leave the carriages.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a resulta ti saan a gagangay a gubat iti baybay ti Britania?,"The correct answer is **C: Inaramid dagiti panagbalbaliw iti internasional a linteg (It led to a disregard of international law)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sa napaneknekan nga epektibo ti pamay-an, ti panagikkat kadagiti kasapulan a suplay ti militar ken sibilian...ngem daytoy a panagserra ilabsingna ti kangrunaan nga akseptado a internasional a linteg nga ipaay dagiti sumagmamano a tulagan iti naudi a dua a siglo.""  This clearly indicates that Britain's blockade disregarded international law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kayat nga imangmangged ti Germany ti pada a taktika ti pannakigubat (Germany wanted to employ similar tactics):**  The passage explicitly states that Germany *did* employ similar tactics with its U-boats.  This wasn't a *result* of the British blockade; it was Germany's response to it.
* **B: Nairaman ti peggad dagiti neutral a barko (Neutral ships were also attacked):** The passage says the British blockade *attacked* neutral ships, not that neutral ships were also attacked as a *result* of the blockade.  The blockade *caused* the attacks on neutral ships.
* **D: Dagiti napateg a suplay ket saan a madanon (Strategic supplies were unavailable):** The passage states that the blockade was *effective* in cutting off supplies. Therefore, strategic supplies *were* unavailable. This is the opposite of what the question asks.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagserra ti baybay kontra Germany?,"The correct answer is **A: Inkontrana iti internasional a linteg**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...daytoy a panagserra ilabsingna ti kangrunaan nga akseptado a internasional a linteg nga ipaay dagiti sumagmamano a tulagan iti naudi a dua a siglo."" This means the blockade violated established international law.
* **Options B, C, and D are related to the *German response* to the blockade, not the *reason the blockade was problematic*.** The blockade's issue wasn't how Germany responded to it, but that the blockade itself was a violation of international law.

Therefore, the primary issue or challenge related to the blockade was its conflict with international law.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti mabalin a maaddaan iti Multiple Sclerosis?","The correct answer is **C: Lalaki a 43 ti tawenna**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Naduktalan iti panagsukisok a mamindua a daras a mabalin a maaddaan iti MS dagiti babbai ngem dagiti lallaki."" This translates to: ""It has been found that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.""

However, the options provided are ages. The passage doesn't specify an age range, but the options allow us to infer. Considering the information given, and the typical age of onset for MS, **43** is the most plausible age, as it falls within the range where MS is commonly diagnosed. The other ages (10, 15, 32) are less typical.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, dagiti tumabuno iti regular nga aktibidad ket kasapulanda ti ad-adu a suporta para ti?","The correct answer is **A: Negatibo a pannakaawat iti ut-ot (Negative perception of the back)**.

The text states: ""Dagiti tumabuno iti regular nga aktibidad ket kasapulan ti ad-adu a suporta babaen ti negatibo a pannakaawat iti ut-ot a maiduma iti nagsabalian ti napaut nga ut-ot ken sakit a marikna gapu iti normal a panaggaraw iti pisikal."" This directly links regular activity with needing more support due to negative perceptions of their back.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano ti kadawyan a pannakaay-ayam ti fencing?","The best answer is **D: Iti duelo a pormat**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Daytoy nga isport ket kangrunaanen a maay-ayam iti duelo a pormat, maysa a fencer a makiduelo iti maysa pay."" (This sport is primarily practiced in a duel format, with one fencer competing against another.)

While the passage mentions different levels (university, professional, Olympics), it emphasizes the core *format* of fencing. The duel format is the fundamental way the sport is played.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kangrunaan a pagilasinan ti pannakasabidong iti uneg?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a pagyanan ti agas**.

The text states: ""Ti kangrunaan a pagilasinan ti internal a pannakasabidong ket ti kaadda ti nakalukat a pagyanan ti agas wenno dagiti makasabidong a kemikal a maus-usar iti balay."" (The main characteristic of internal poisoning is the presence of a corrosive substance or poisonous chemicals used in the home.)

While options A, B, and C *can* be symptoms of poisoning, the text specifically identifies the presence of a corrosive substance as the primary characteristic.  ""Maysa a pagyanan ti agas"" translates to ""a source of corrosive substance.""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti maitutop nga umuna nga addang no sukimaten ti biktima?","The correct answer is **A: Kitaen ti nakapasamakan (See the surroundings)**.

The passage states: ""No sukimaten ti biktima, masapul a kitaen nga umuna ti nakapasamakanna tapno masigurado ti kinatalged."" (If you are questioning the victim, you must first see what happened to ensure safety.)  This implies observing the immediate surroundings is the *first* step.

While the other options are important aspects of questioning a victim, the passage explicitly prioritizes understanding the initial context of the event.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiyanninaw ti proseso ti panangsukimat iti biktima?,"The correct answer is **D: Padasem a padlawin ti aniaman a nalabbaga a bandera**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for things that *don't* clarify the process.** Options A, B, and C all describe crucial steps in properly documenting a victim's condition and scene.
* **Option D (Padlawin ti aniaman a nalabbaga a bandera - Document any red flags)** is a critical step in ensuring safety and thoroughness *without* directly clarifying the immediate process of examination.  Red flags are indicators of potential danger, hidden injuries, or other critical issues.  Documenting these is essential for both the victim's safety and the integrity of the investigation, but it doesn't directly explain *how* to examine the victim.

Therefore, documenting red flags is not a step that *clarifies* the immediate examination process but rather a separate, crucial aspect of the overall procedure.



"
Ania kadagiti panagbaliw nga intignay ti Rebolusion idiay Pransia ti dakkel ti epektona ken ti agtatrabaho a klase ti tattao?,"The correct answer is **B: Panagiyakar ti pokus aggapu iti klase mapan kinalaing.**

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the shift in power.** The passage explicitly states that the Revolution, despite initial ambitions of powerful men, ultimately led to a broader participation of working-class people. It also mentions the military becoming merit-based rather than class-based. This signifies a move away from the traditional focus on noble birth and towards merit and broader societal engagement.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Manayonan a suporta para ti nasion:** While nationalism *did* rise during the French Revolution, the passage doesn't directly link it as the *most* impactful change *for the working class*.
* **C: Panagsurot ti pammati a Republikan:** The Revolution *established* a Republican government.  It didn't diminish the belief in Republicanism.
* **D: Baro a sistema ti panagsukat:** The passage mentions the adoption of the metric system but doesn't portray it as a significant impact on the working class compared to the shift in power dynamics.

Therefore, the most significant and impactful change for the working class resulting from the French Revolution, as indicated in the passage, was the **shift in focus from class to merit/ability.**



"
"Kalpasan ti Rebolusion idiay Pransia, ti balligi kadagiti militar ken dadduma a tarabaho ket basbassit ti posibilidadna a maibasar iti ania?","The correct answer is **C: Ambision**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kasta pay a kalpasan ti Rebolusion, nakalukat dagiti pagobraan iti amin nga aplikante a lallaki a nangipalubos kadagiti addaan nasged nga ambision ken nalalaing tapno agballigi.""  This directly links the rise of individuals in the military and other fields after the French Revolution to their ambition. The passage emphasizes that the revolution opened opportunities for men with significant ambition and talent to advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagragpat (Patronage):** While patronage might have played a role, the passage doesn't specifically highlight it as the primary driver.
* **B: Klase (Class):** The passage explicitly states that military ranks were *not* based on class, but on caliber (ability).
* **D: Kalibre (Caliber):** While mentioned, ""caliber"" is used to describe *how* ranks were determined, not the underlying reason *for* the rise of individuals. Ambition is the more fundamental reason mentioned.



"
Ania a serbisio a publiko ti makuna a pakaigapuan ti kaaduan a di pannakakontento idiay nababaknang a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **A: Kalidad ti danum**.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""Iti nababaknang a pagilian ket manmano a mangeg ti agpapada a reklamo maipapan iti kalidad ti danum wenno rangtay a madaddadael."" (In a developed country, people readily complain about the quality of water or polluted air.) This directly links water quality to public dissatisfaction.
* **The question asks:** ""Ania a serbisio a publiko ti makuna a pakaigapuan ti kaaduan a di pannakakontento idiay nababaknang a pagilian?"" (Which public service is most often the cause of public dissatisfaction in a developed country?)
* **The text also implies:** The system of public transportation *does* receive complaints, but the problem with public transportation in developed countries is that complaints aren't always resolved. The text highlights that people readily complain about water and air quality.

While the text mentions complaints about transportation, it explicitly states that water quality is *more* frequently the source of public dissatisfaction. Therefore, **Kalidad ti danum (Water Quality)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

* **The provided text focuses on complaints about transportation systems.** The initial paragraphs discuss why transportation systems receive complaints, and the question asks what the public thinks of public transportation *according to the text*.
* **The text highlights dissatisfaction with transportation.** It mentions that even in wealthy countries, people complain about the quality of water or drinking water.  This parallels the implication that people are likely to complain about public transportation.
* **The question about why transportation systems don't address complaints implies that complaints *do* exist.** If there weren't complaints, the question wouldn't be relevant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaykayat isuda ti amin a mangusar kaniada:**  While technically true, this isn't the core point being made in the initial text. It doesn't explain *why* complaints arise.
* **B: Saanda agpada ti kinadakes iti kalidad ti danum:**  This is irrelevant to the discussion of transportation.
* **D: Libre isuda idiay kaadduan a nababaknang a pagilian:** The text doesn't mention whether public transportation is free.  This is a separate issue.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti narigat a rukoden gapu ti di mapakpakadaan nga ugali ti agmanmaneho?","The correct answer is **D: Agus ti trapiko (Traffic flow)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ti panagadal iti urnos ti trapiko ket narigat gapu iti ugali ti agmanmaneho ket sigurado a saan a mapugtuan iti sangagasut a porsiento."" (Studying traffic patterns is difficult because driving behavior cannot be completely controlled.) This directly relates to the difficulty in predicting and managing traffic flow due to unpredictable driver actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kinapartak ti trapiko (Traffic congestion):** While traffic flow contributes to congestion, the text doesn't specifically identify *congestion* as the difficult element. The difficulty lies in the *flow* itself being hard to predict.
*   **B: Panagplano ti kalsada (Road planning):** Road planning is mentioned as something that can be *helped* by understanding traffic patterns. The text doesn't say it's difficult *because* of unpredictable driving behavior.
*   **C: Dagiti operasion ti kalsada (Road operations):** Similar to road planning, road operations are mentioned as areas that can benefit from understanding traffic patterns.  The text doesn't indicate a difficulty in road operations stemming from unpredictable driving.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maus-usar no iladawan ti agus ti trapiko babaen iti matematika?,"The correct answer is **B: Ugali ti agmanmaneho (Driving behavior)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""No man pay kasta, ti panagadal iti urnos ti trapiko ket narigat gapu iti ugali ti agmanmaneho ket sigurado a saan a mapugtuan iti sangagasut a porsiento."" This means understanding driving behavior is a significant challenge in traffic modeling.

While the other options are related to traffic, they aren't the *primary* focus of the passage regarding the difficulty of using mathematics to model traffic flow.

*   **A: Dagiti operasion ti kalsada (Road operations)** is a broader category that includes driving behavior but isn't the specific difficulty highlighted.
*   **C: Disenio ti kalsada (Road design)** is something that can *benefit* from traffic modeling, but the passage focuses on the *difficulty* in modeling the flow itself.
*   **D: Kinaadu ti trapiko (Traffic density)** is a result *influenced* by driving behavior and other factors, but not the core challenge in modeling.

Therefore, the passage directly links the difficulty of using math to model traffic flow to the unpredictability of **driving behavior**.
"
Ania ti inusar da Hershey ken Chase tapno maimulada ti bukodda a DNA? ,"The correct answer is **D: Birus**.

Here's why:

The question asks what Hershey and Chase used to deliver their DNA into the bacteria. The passage explicitly states they used a **virus (phage)** to inject their DNA into the bacteria. The radioactive phosphorus and sulfur were used to label *either* the DNA *or* the protein, respectively, to track their fate.  The virus was the delivery vehicle.
"
Ti abilidad a maipatawid iti mutation iti anak ket depende iti ania?,"The correct answer is **A: No dagiti selula ket germ-line**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Dagiti laeng mutation ti selula iti germline ti mabalin a maipatawid kadagiti annak..."" (Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring...).  While the other factors (mutation type, genetic material affected, cell death) influence the *outcome* of a mutation, the *ability to be inherited* is directly tied to whether the mutation occurs in germline cells.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.
"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, saan nga agpannuray ti nadumaduma nga epekto ti mutation iti ania?","The correct answer is **B: No ti naapektaran a selula ket germ-line**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Laeng mutation ti selula iti germline ti mabalin a maipatawid kadagiti annak..."" (Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring...).  The passage then goes on to say that other types of mutations can lead to cell death or cancer. This implies that the germline status of the affected cell is a key factor determining the outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaadu ti naapektaran a genetiko a materiales:** While the passage mentions the extent of the affected genetic material influences the effect, it doesn't say it's *not* a factor in determining the different effects of mutations.
* **C: Kinapateg ti naapektaran a genetiko a materiales:** Similar to A, the passage acknowledges the importance of the affected genetic material's importance, but doesn't say it doesn't play a role in the different effects of mutations.
* **D: Klase ti naapektaran a mutation:** The passage *does* say that the *type* of mutation is a factor in determining the effect.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a rason a nangataraken ti kalding dagiti kadaanan a kultura?,"The correct answer is **B: Makatulongda nga agarab ti daga (Help cultivate the land)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the cultures and tribes domesticated goats for milk, meat, wool, and hides.** The passage explicitly mentions the importance of these products.
* **The passage describes the goats' adaptability for transportation and their role in pastoralism.** This reinforces their value as a source of resources.
* **The passage doesn't mention any role for goats in cultivating the land.**  Domesticated animals were primarily used for providing resources, not for tilling soil.

Therefore, option B is the least likely reason for the domestication of goats according to the information provided in the text.
"
Ti panggep ti golf ket kabassitan ti bilang ti ania?,"The correct answer is **D: Ab-abut (Holes)**.

The passage states: ""Sangapulo-ket-walo nga abut ti maay-ayam iti gagangay a round...""  This directly refers to the number of holes in a standard round of golf.
"
"Iti course ti golf, sadinno ti naab-ababa ti panagarbas ti ruot?","The correct answer is **B: Iti green**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ti ruot iti aglawlaw ti abut ket maarbasan ket maawagan iti green."" (The ball landing on the grass of the hole is considered to be on the green.)
* The green is the area immediately surrounding the hole, and it's where players aim to get their ball to finish the hole.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti maika-sangapulo ket walo nga abut:** This refers to the total number of holes, not where the ball is considered ""on the green.""
* **C: Iti umuna nga abut:** This is the first hole of the course, not where the ball is considered ""on the green.""
* **D: Iti umuna a kagudua ti course:** This refers to the second hole of the course, not where the ball is considered ""on the green.""



"
Ania ti kadawyan a gandat ti eksperimento?,"The correct answer is **A: Tapno maikkat ti maysa wenno ad-adu pay a mabalin a patta-patta (To test one or more possible hypotheses)**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the common goal of an experiment. The provided text states that experiments are a way for scientists to investigate. The options describe different goals:

*   **A** directly reflects the purpose of testing hypotheses – to determine if a proposed explanation is supported by evidence.
*   **B** is a broader goal of science, but not specific to the *experiment* itself.
*   **C** is a potential *outcome* of an experiment, but not the primary *goal*.
*   **D** describes the overall aim of scientific inquiry, but doesn't capture the specific function of an experiment.

Therefore, option A best describes the common goal of an experiment."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan a makatulong a mangiturong ti nasientipikuan a panagsirarak?","The correct answer is **A: Ti pamay-an a sientipiko laeng (The scientific method alone)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while the scientific method is a core part of scientific inquiry, it's *not the only thing*. It also mentions:

* **Eksperimentasion (Experimentation):**  A test to evaluate possible explanations.
* **Panagsaludsod (Observation):** Gathering information.
* **Panagpaliiw (Interpretation):**  Explaining observations.

Therefore, the passage explicitly says experimentation, observation, and interpretation are also crucial for scientific inquiry. The scientific method *includes* these elements but isn't the whole story on its own.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mangaramid dagiti kapaliiwan (Making interpretations):**  Interpretation is directly mentioned as a key part of scientific inquiry.
* **C: Panangikkat kadagiti mabalin a patta-patta (Formulating hypotheses):** Forming hypotheses is a fundamental step within the scientific method.
* **D: Mangaramid dagiti eksperimento (Conducting experiments):** Experimentation is a crucial part of testing hypotheses and gathering data.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng ti ipu-ipo ti saan a pudno?","The correct answer is **A: Ti ipu-ipo ket madadaelda ti aniaman a madalananda.**

The passage states: ""Paruten dagiti tornado dagiti kaykayo, lekkabenna dagiti diding dagiti pasdek istruktura, ken ipalladawna dagiti kotse iti tagangatang."" This directly translates to ""Tornadoes can uproot trees, tear down the walls of building structures, and throw cars into the air.""  This indicates that tornadoes are capable of causing significant damage to anything in their path.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti ipu-ipo ket timmamtama iti basbassit a lugar kompara iti dadduma a bagyo:** The passage says the tornadoes are *small* compared to other storms, but it doesn't say that's a *weakness*. It's just a descriptive detail.
* **C: Ti kaaduan ti ipu-ipo ket agpaut iti nasurok a tallo nga oras:**  The passage mentions the duration of *two percent* of tornadoes, not the majority.
* **D: Ti sumagmamano nga ipu-ipo ket addaan ti angin nga agingga ti 300 milia kada oras:** The passage states that *strong* storms can have winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph). Saying ""some"" have up to 300 mph is less accurate than saying they can reach 480 km/h.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti kaaduan dagiti ipu-ipo?","The correct answer is **A: Kadawyan nga agpautda iti nasurok a tallo nga oras**.

The text states: ""Agpaut laeng iti nasurok a tallo nga oras ti dua porsiento kadagiti kararangragsan a tornado."" This directly addresses how long tornadoes typically last.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agaramidda ti angin nga agingga ti 480 milia kada oras** - While the text mentions high winds, it doesn't say this is the *reason* for the frequent tornadoes.
* **C: Maapektaranda iti dakdakkel a lugar kompara iti dadduma a bagyo** - The text actually says the opposite: ""Timmama dagiti ipu-ipo dagiti ipu-ipo kompara iti dadduma a naranggas a bagyo, ngem madadaelda ti aniaman a madalananda."" (Tornadoes are small compared to other severe storms, but can damage anything in their path.)
* **D: Parutenda dagiti kaykayo manipud iti daga** - This describes one effect of tornadoes, but not a reason for their frequency.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti rugian nga usaren dagiti tattao idi maika-16 a siglo?,"The correct answer is **C: Mangaramid dagiti lente (Making lenses)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the European telescope in the 16th century used a combination of lenses. 
*  To build a telescope, you first need to *make* lenses. 
* While the other options are related to telescopes, they aren't the foundational action described in the passage. The passage focuses on the *use* of lenses, not the finished product (telescope) or the simple act of magnifying objects.



"
Kasano kabayag a mangpadpadakkel dagiti bambanag ti tattao babaen ti panangusar kadagiti lente?,"The correct answer is **B: Manipud iti arinunos ti maika-16 a siglo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""naaramid ti immuna a teleskopio iti Europa idi arinunos ti maika-16 a siglo."" (The first telescope in Europe was made in the 16th century.)
* The passage goes on to describe how these telescopes used a combination of lenses.
* While the principle of lenses magnifying images has been known for a long time, the *first practical telescopes* were developed in the 16th century.

Therefore, option B directly reflects the information provided in the text. The other options are either too broad (""thousands of years"") or inaccurate based on the passage.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti maibaga ti kueba ni Muhammad maipapan kadagiti espiritual nga aramid ken pategna?","The correct answer is **A: Ipatpategna ti kinatalna ken kinabukbukod (Emphasizes solitude and seclusion)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Muhammad often retreated to the cave of Hira to ""meditate.""
* It also highlights the isolation of the cave: ""If you were inside the cave, you would be completely secluded. You would not see anything except the clear, beautiful light of the stars and the distant mountains. Within this small world, there is little to see or hear.""
* This emphasizes the importance of solitude and seclusion for his spiritual practices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti arimbangaw idiay ruar ket makatulong ti panagmennamenna (The angels outside helped in his meditation):** The passage *doesn't* mention angels helping him. It focuses on his solitary meditation.
* **C: Kassapulanna ti bassit unay nga oras ti pagmaymaysa (He needed only a very short time for communion):** The passage doesn't specify the length of time he spent in the cave.
* **D: Madanagan isuna a makakita ken makangngeg kaniana (He could see and hear himself):** The passage directly contradicts this, stating that there was little to see or hear within the cave.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti umuna a nakapausaranna ti landok?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti crosstie**.

The passage states: ""Dagiti crosstie ket naipakaammo a nasapa tapno iplastar dagiti track."" (Cross ties were known to be nailed down to the tracks.) This indicates that cross ties were used as the initial form of track. While the passage later discusses the evolution of the track, it explicitly mentions cross ties as the earliest known element used to lay down the tracks.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, apay a nasuktan ti pilid a landok dagiti pilid a kayo?","The correct answer is **C: Kabaelanda nga awiten ti dakdakkel a karga (Their ability to carry heavy loads).**

The text states: ""Idi agangay, nasuktan dagiti pilid a kayo iti pilid a landok."" This translates to ""As they became more advanced, the wooden sleepers were matched with thick sleepers."" The reason for this was to **carry heavier loads** (awiten ti dakdakel a karga). The passage mentions the Wagonways needed to carry heavier loads and the use of iron to improve the tracks' ability to withstand wear and tear.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inpatpangatoda ti kapartak dagiti kabalio (To reinforce the wheels):** While the wheels were important, the text doesn't directly link the thick sleepers to wheel reinforcement.
* **B: Nakonsiderarda nga ad-adda ti kabaelanna (Their strength was considered):**  While strength is a factor, the primary reason for making them thicker was to carry heavier loads.
* **D: Mabanbannogda iti kalsada babaen ti landok (To protect the road from the sleepers):** This is the opposite of what happened. The thicker sleepers *protected* the road.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mangmuli kadagiti indibidual bayat ti panawen ti Romantisismo?","The correct answer is **B: Heograpiya**.

The passage explicitly states: "" Iti konteksto ti Romantisismo, ti heograpiya ti mangmuli kadagiti indibidual a tattao..."" which translates to ""In the context of Romanticism, geography determines the individual...""



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a mangiyanninaw ti sapasap nga ideya ti teknolohikal a determinismo? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ti epekto ti teknolohia iti gimong ket nakundision iti gimong.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""kaadwan nga interpretasion iti teknolohikal a pangdetermina ket mangited iti dua a kapanunutan: a ti pannakaaramid ti teknolohiya ket sumursurot iti dalan a limmabes iti impluwensia ti kultura wenno pulitika, ken iti teknolohia ket addaan met ti “epekto” kadagiti natawid a gimong, ngem kadagiti nakundison iti gimong.""
* **Option A directly reflects this:** It accurately captures the idea that technology's impact on society is *dependent* on society itself. It's not a direct, unmediated cause-and-effect relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti pagannayasan ti teknolohia ket saan a naimpluwensiaan ti kultura:** This is the *opposite* of what the passage suggests. The passage states technology *is* influenced by culture and politics.
* **C: Ti teknolohia ket addaan dagiti nainkasigudan nga epekto iti gimong:** The passage argues *against* the idea of fixed or predictable effects. It emphasizes that the effects are conditioned by society.
* **D: Ti teknolohikal a pagannayasan ket saan a naibasar iti impluwensia ti pulitika:** Again, this contradicts the passage, which mentions political influence as a factor in shaping technology.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a mainaig ti panagguyod ti pana?","The correct answer is **A: Ti nakapkapsut nga uni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""In an up-bow it makes a *distinct* sound, but in a down-bow it is firm and solid."" This implies that a distinct/unique sound is a characteristic of the up-bow, but not necessarily a feature of the bow *itself* in relation to the arrow's flight.

The other options are directly related to the bow and its action:

* **B: Ti marka a kasla maysa nga staple:** The bow mark is described as something you make on the bow.
* **C: Ti napigpigsa nga uni:** This describes the sound produced during a down-bow.
* **D: Mangrugi iti frog:**  The text explicitly states that you start the bow draw at the frog.



Therefore, the only option that isn't specifically discussed in connection to the bow's function or sound production is ""ti nakapkapsut nga uni"" (the distinct sound).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mainaig ti nakapkapsut nga uni?","The correct answer is **C: Ti marka a kasla V**.

The text states: ""Sa ti up-bow ket gagangay nga ag-araramid ti nakapkapsut nga uno..."" which translates to ""With the up-bow, it is possible to make a striking/unique sound...""  The ""striking/unique sound"" is attributed to the ""marka a kasla V"" (mark that looks like a V).
"
Inpakita dagiti fossil a ti ima ket nakibagay met laeng nga para ti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **A: Panangpaandar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti fossil a tulang ti ima ket addaan iti dua a milion agingga iti tallo a milion a tawen a nangipalgak ti dayta ima agsipud iti panaggaraw agingga iti **panangpaandar**."" (Fossil bones of the image showed that the image evolved from sunbathing to **standing**.)

The passage emphasizes that the evolution of the human foot was primarily driven by the need to stand upright. While it mentions sunbathing and supporting weight, the evolution *led to* standing. Options B, C, and D are mentioned as *early* uses of the foot, but the core driver of the evolution described in the passage is standing.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a mangiladawan kadagiti phalanges ti chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ti ima ken saka da ket agduduma ti kadakkelda.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti ima ti tao ket ab-ababa ngem iti saka, nga addaan nadirdiretso a tulang. **Dagiti fossil a tulang ti ima ket addaan iti dua a milion agingga iti tallo a milion a tawen a nangipalgak ti daytoy a pagbaliwan iti pannakaisansangayanna dayta ima agsipud iti panaggaraw agingga iti panangpaandar.**""

This directly contrasts the size of the phalanges (finger bones) in humans versus chimpanzees.  While both are similar in size, the passage emphasizes the difference in the bones themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nadirdiretsoda ngem kadagiti tao:** While human phalanges are straighter than chimpanzee phalanges, this isn't the *key* difference mentioned in the text. The difference in size is more prominent.
*   **C: Mausarda ti panagsuporta ti dagsen:** The passage says chimpanzees use their hands for supporting themselves, but it doesn't state humans do.
*   **D: Kangrunaan a mausarda ti panangpaandar:** The passage mentions that both chimpanzees and humans used their hands for tasks like foraging and tool use, but doesn't highlight one being primarily for tool use.



"
Ti panagpili ket ikkatenna ti genetiko a kinanadumaduma manipud iti ania a pool?,"The correct answer is **A: Nailemmeng (Mutations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti panagpili ket mangik-ikkat kadagitoy *pagpilyan*.""  The ""pagpilyan"" refers to the genetic variation upon which natural selection acts.  That genetic variation comes from mutations.  Mutations are the source of new genetic differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rekombinasion (Recombination):**  Recombination (during sexual reproduction) shuffles existing genetic variation but doesn't *create* new variation. It's a way of rearranging what's already there.
* **C: Panaglalasin (Assortment):** Assortment refers to how chromosomes are separated during meiosis, contributing to genetic variation, but it doesn't *create* new genetic information.
* **D: Makitkita (Phenotype):** Phenotype is the observable characteristics of an organism, resulting from the interaction of genotype and environment.  It's *influenced* by genotype but isn't the source of genetic variation itself.

Therefore, the passage directly implies that natural selection acts on the *genetic variation* which is primarily generated by mutations (nailemmeng).



"
Ania a proseso iti responsable a manginayon ti genetiko a kinanadumaduma?,"The correct answer is **C: Mutasion**.

Here's why:

* **Mutations** are changes in the DNA sequence. They are the *ultimate* source of all new genetic variation. Without mutations, there would be no new traits to be selected for.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Panaglalasin (Recombination):**  While recombination (during meiosis) shuffles existing genes to create new combinations, it *doesn't* create new genetic information. It rearranges what's already there.
* **Makitkita (Visible):** This refers to traits that can be observed, but it's not a process that *creates* variation. Visible traits are the *result* of genetic differences.
* **Rekombinasion (Recombination):** This is a process that shuffles existing genes during sexual reproduction. It *increases* genetic variation, but it's not the original source of that variation.

The passage states that mutations *create* new genetic variation, which is then acted upon by natural selection. Therefore, mutation is the primary process responsible for maintaining genetic diversity.
"
"Segun iti impormasion iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti rumbeng a kanen ti primate tapno masolbar ti “problema ti protina”?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti pupuon ti sabong (Bird droppings)**.

Here's why:

The text states that while proteins can be found in plants (like seeds and nuts), they are difficult for primates to digest without cooking. Animal products (insects, grubs, eggs) provide a lot of protein with all essential amino acids.  The problem is solving the ""protein problem"" in the savanna.  The text doesn't mention any of the other options as a solution to this specific protein problem. The only option that aligns with the text's context, specifically the difficultly of digesting plants, is the option about bird droppings which contain a high concentration of protein.

Therefore, the answer is D.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a problema ti saan a gapo ti panagkurang ti pakasapulanna nga amino acid?","The correct answer is **B: Malnutrision**.

The passage explicitly states that the inability to digest proteins from plants (common in savanna environments) leads to **malnutrition**. The other options (digestive problems, stunted growth, and death) are all consequences *of* malnutrition. 

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Digestive problems:** While potentially related, the passage focuses on the *lack of usable protein* as the core issue, not simply general digestive problems.
* **C: Stunted growth:**  Stunted growth is a *result* of malnutrition, not the primary problem itself.
* **D: Death:** Death is an extreme consequence of severe malnutrition, but the passage identifies malnutrition as a more direct and encompassing problem.



"
Kasano nga ipakita dagiti miembro iti partikular a subkultura ti asosasionda iti grupo?,"The correct answer is **D: Babaen ti panagusar iti istilo kas a porma ti simbolismo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Masansan nga ipaduyakyak dagiti miembro ti subkultura ti kinamiembroda babaen ti mailasin ken simboliko a panagusar iti istilo, a pakairamanan dagiti uso nga aruaten, galad, ken pagsasao."" (Members of subcultures often display their affiliation with the group through the symbolic use of style, incorporating current trends, clothing, and language.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Babaen ti panangpadas a makilaok (Through being a good listener):** While listening can be a part of belonging, it's not the primary or defining way subculture membership is displayed.
* **B: Babaen ti panangsurot ti pammati dagiti amin nga adda iti aglawlawda (Through imitating everything that exists in the surrounding environment):** Subcultures *differentiate* themselves by *not* blindly imitating the mainstream. They adapt and create their own styles.
* **C: Babaen ti panangawat dagiti pagalagadan ti kagimongan (Through adopting the beliefs of the mainstream):**  Subcultures often *reject* mainstream beliefs and values.

Therefore, option D directly aligns with the information provided in the passage.

"Segun iti teorya nga inpresentar iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a mapasamak iti maysa nga ubing a malasin nga adda iti minoridad a rasa nga ipanangmatmat ti mamagpeggad a kababalin?","The correct answer is **B: Ad-adu ti posibilidadna a makipaset adiay ubing iti mamagpeggad a kababalin.**

Here's why:

The passage states that children who are exposed to negative stereotypes about their minority race may be less likely to succeed in school. This implies an increased *possibility* of them being negatively affected and thus, less likely to thrive academically.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Padasen adiay ubing a liklikan iti makipaset ti mamagpeggad a kababalin:** The passage doesn't suggest avoiding exposure. The issue is *what* they are exposed to (negative stereotypes).
*   **C: Umadayo adiay ubing kadagiti kasasaad ti kagimongan:** While potentially a coping mechanism, the passage doesn't directly state this. It focuses on the impact of stereotypes on academic success.
*   **D: Agkedked adiay ubing a makilangen kadagiti dadduma a minoridad a rasa:** The passage doesn't link interaction with other minority groups to academic outcomes.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate interpretation of the passage."
"Segun iti mabasa, ti pannakaammo iti ubing ti panangmatmat iti rasa ket mabalin nga adda epektona iti ania kadagiti sumaganad?","The correct answer is **B: Ti kababalinda (Academic achievement)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kas pagarigan, dagiti ubbing a malasin nga adda iti minoridad a puli a matmataenda a saan a nalaing iti eskuelaan ket mabalin a saanton nga aglaing iti eskuelaan apaman a maammuanda ti panangmatmata kadakuada a mainaig iti pulida."" This directly links the experience of being told they belong to a minority race and not being successful in school to a lack of academic achievement.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ti minoridad a rasa a pinilida a pakilasinan** - While the passage mentions minority races, it's not the *effect* being discussed, but rather the effect on something else.
*   **C: Ti relasionda iti dadduma nga ubbing** - The passage doesn't explicitly mention the effect on relationships with other children.
*   **D: Ti depinasionda ti rasa** - The passage discusses *learning* about race, not necessarily defining it. It's about the *impact* of that learning.



Therefore, the passage explicitly connects learning about race and ethnic identity to academic achievement."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nalabit a maitunos iti pannakapadakkel ti feral nga ubbing?","The correct answer is **A: Agwaywayas a panagbiag (Survival)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Maipagarup a dagiti dadduma ket pinadakkel dagiti ayup; kunada a sumagmamano ti nagbibiag nga is-isuda iti langalang."" (It is believed that others raise these animals; some live in the wild.) This indicates that survival in the wild is a key factor in how feral children are raised.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nalaing ai pannakisarita (Good at speaking):** The text doesn't mention language skills as a defining characteristic of feral children.
* **C: Ti pagannayasan nga agmaymaysa (Accustomed to being with others):**  Feral children are *isolated* from others. The text emphasizes their abandonment and isolation.
* **D: Panagdanag iti lawlaw ti adu a tao (Used to the presence of many people):** The text describes feral children as *avoiding* people and exhibiting animalistic behaviors around them.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti feral a kababalin dagiti ubbing?","The correct answer is **B: Ti feral a kababalin ket mabalin nga aggapu ti kinakurang ti pannakilangen iti tao.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""...saan a pinakelangenan iti nataengan bayat a dumakdakkelda. Maawagan a """"feral"""" wenno atap dagita nga ubbing."" This highlights the *lack* of human interaction as the defining characteristic.
* It also mentions abandonment due to parental hardship or neglect, implying the absence of proper care.
* While physical abuse (A) *can* occur, the text emphasizes the lack of human contact as the primary cause of feral behavior.
* Option C is incorrect because the text mentions abandonment due to parental issues, not solely confinement by parents.
* Option D is incorrect because the text doesn't say *all* feral behavior is due to extreme neglect; it includes situations of abandonment and hardship.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga aramid ti saan nga agtunos iti subsistence nga agrikultura?","The correct answer is **A: Agwanawan laeng iti maysa nga apit para iti kasapulan ti mannalon ken ti pamiliana.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ti subsistence nga agrikultura ket maysa a simple, kaaduanna nga organiko, a sistema nga agus-usar iti naidulin a bukel a natibo iti rehion ken nanayonan kadagiti teknik a crop rotation wenno sabsabali pay a simple laeng a teknik tapno mapaadu ti apit."" This means the primary goal is to produce enough food for the farmer and their family.
* **Options B and C are incorrect:**  Subsistence farming is *not* about producing surplus to sell (B) or maximizing yield with advanced techniques (C). These are characteristics of commercial agriculture, not subsistence agriculture.
* **Option D is partially correct but not the primary focus:** While subsistence farming does utilize local resources (D), the core definition revolves around food production for the family, not just resource utilization.

Therefore, option A best captures the essence of subsistence agriculture as defined in the text."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti aramid ti subsistence nga agrikultura?,"The correct answer is **B: Us-usarenna ti naidumduma a teknik tapno mapaadu ti apit.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ti subsistence nga agrikultura ket maysa a simple, kaaduanna nga organiko, a sistema nga agus-usar iti naidulin a bukel a natibo iti rehion ken nanayonan kadagiti teknik a crop rotation wenno sabsabali pay a simple laeng a teknik tapno mapaadu ti apit.""  This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Intero nga organiko iti sistema:** While the text mentions the system is ""kaaduanna nga organiko,"" it doesn't say it's *entirely* organic. Subsistence farming can involve some non-organic practices.
* **C: Pagbalinenna dagiti agrikulturalista nga agiparabur ti apit iti intero a rehion:**  The text focuses on individual farming practices within a region, not on regional cooperation for pest control.
* **D: Us-usaren pay laeng daytoy dagiti mannalon iti dadduma a nasion:** The text states that *many* farmers who practiced subsistence farming still do so in *many* developing countries. It doesn't limit its use to specific nations.



"
Ti panagbisita ti museo ket mairaman iti ania a kategoria ti turismo?,"The correct answer is **C: Kultural a turismo**.

Here's why:

* **Kultural a turismo** specifically focuses on visiting places to learn about a region's history, art, architecture, and way of life. Museums are prime examples of cultural attractions, showcasing artifacts, historical objects, and artistic expressions.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Panaglinglingay a turismo (Sightseeing tourism):** This is a broader category encompassing visiting various sights, but it doesn't necessarily imply a focus on cultural learning.
* **Negosio a turismo (Business tourism):** This refers to travel for business purposes like conferences and meetings.
* **Iti ruar a turismo (Adventure tourism):** This involves activities like hiking, climbing, or other physically challenging pursuits.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti prioridad dagiti managlinglingay a turista?","The correct answer is **B: Agsardeng ti gagangay nga inaldaw nga aktibidadda**.

Here's why:

The passage states that sightseeing tourism is about traveling to a place for relaxation and rejuvenation through different activities. Options A, C, and D are aspects of tourism, but the passage emphasizes the *activities* as the primary draw. The passage explicitly mentions beaches, theme parks, and campgrounds, which are places for leisure and activities. 

While cultural tourism (mentioned in the passage) *does* involve learning about culture and history, the main focus of sightseeing tourism described is the activity itself, leading to relaxation and rejuvenation.

Ania ti nadakamat iti mabasa a banag a nakatulong a mangkissay ti panagamak iti panagbalbaliw iti uneg ti lokal a simbaan?,"The correct answer is **A: Pananglagip iti napalabas a balligi ti garaw ti panagnegosio.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Iti daytoy a kanito, ti pananglagip iti napalabas a garaw ti panagnegosio ken dagiti balligi ket nakatulong kadagiti tattao nga agbalin a nakalukat kadagiti baro a panagbaliw ken baro a turong para iti lokal a simbaan.""  This directly connects reflecting on past business history and lessons learned to enabling people to adapt to new changes and guidance.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Pannakaawat kadagiti tattao a nangiturturong iti kultura ti organisasion:** While understanding people who shaped the culture is helpful, the text focuses on *lessons from the history*, not just understanding the people themselves.
* **C: Panagdiskubre kadagiti mangtignay ti puersa ti organisasion:** Discovering the forces at play is related, but the text emphasizes *reflecting* on the past history of business, which leads to adaptation.
* **D: Maawatan iti pakasaritaan ti organisasion:** Understanding the history is a prerequisite, but the text highlights *reflecting on the past lessons* as the crucial element for adapting to the future.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti makagun-od iti pannakaawat ti bukod a pakasaritaan ti maysa a tao ket makatulong iti ania?","The correct answer is **C: Mangbirok ti rikna ti nakaibatuganda iti uneg ti organisasion.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bayat nga ad-adalen kadagiti panagballigi ken agbalin a naammo kadagiti pannakapaay, dagiti tattao ken ti amuin a nakiraman a tattao ket makadiskubre iti naun-uneg nga addaan pateg, panggep, ken pigsa a mangiturturong iti organisasion.""  This directly links understanding the history to discovering hidden values, principles, and spirit within the organization.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Mangkissay iti panagamak iti panagbaliw:** While the history *can* inform future change, the passage doesn't primarily focus on initiating change. It emphasizes understanding the existing foundation.
* **B: Manangpapigsa dagiti pateg:** The passage mentions reinforcing values as a *result* of understanding history, but it's not the main benefit of the historical understanding itself.
* **D: Mangpasayaat ti garaw ti panagnegosio:** The passage doesn't directly connect historical understanding to improving business results. It focuses more on the internal values and spirit of the organization.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiyanninaw ti postmodern approach iti panagadal?,"The correct answer is **D: Awan ti absoluto iti panagsursuro (There is no absolute in teaching).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the lack of a single, superior teaching method.** It states that postmodernism rejects a single best approach and that teaching is situated within the relationship between the teacher and the information presented. 
* **Option D directly reflects this idea of no single, absolute truth or method.** The passage argues that what works is context-dependent, aligning perfectly with the concept of no absolute.
* **Options A, B, and C are incorrect.** They all suggest that there *are* good methods or that teaching can focus on certain things, which contradicts the central argument of the passage. The passage explicitly states that different methods can be good, but none are definitively the best.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiyanninaw ti postmodern approach iti panagadal?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti sumagmamano a padas iti panagsursuro ket rumbeng a maipangpangruna ngem iti dadduma (Various teaching methods are not necessarily primary but complementary).**

Here's why:

* **The prompt describes a core tenet of postmodernism: there's no single, definitive way to teach.** It emphasizes that teaching is a dynamic interaction between the instructor and the presented information.  
* **Option B directly reflects this idea.** It states that different teaching methods aren't necessarily *the* primary method, but rather *complementary* – meaning they work together in diverse ways. This aligns with the postmodern view of knowledge and teaching.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Adu dagiti wagas ti panagadal ti impormasion (There are many ways to learn information):** While true, this doesn't specifically address the *postmodern approach to teaching* itself.  It speaks more generally about learning.
* **C: Ti padas iti panagsursuro ket agpannuray iti agsursuro ken ti pannakaammo a naipresentar (Teaching is a negotiation between the instructor and the presented information):** This is *partially* correct, but option B is a *more complete* and accurate reflection of the postmodern perspective.  Negotiation is a component, but the emphasis on *different methods* being complementary is key.
* **D: Ti pannakaammo a saantayo a maiyaplikar ket maikari a masursuro latta (Information that we cannot apply can also be learned):**  This is a valid statement about the nature of learning, but it doesn't directly address the core argument about the lack of a single teaching approach that postmodernism puts forward.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate representation of the postmodern view described in the prompt.

"Kalpasan ti sipapakinakem a panagriing bayat ti tiempo ti normal a panagturog, ania kadagitoy ti sumampitaw ti proseso ti pannakaistorbo ti panagturog?","The correct answer is **C: Panangiddep ti alarma idiay nightstand-mo ken panagturog manen iti duapulo a minuto kalpasanna.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what *interferes* with the sleep cycle.** The passage describes sleep inertia as the grogginess after being woken up. Option C directly describes the action of using an alarm clock in the middle of a sleep cycle, which is the definition of sleep inertia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagbasa iti maysa ket kagudua nga oras sakbay ti pannaturog manen** (Reading a book for two hours before going to sleep): While not ideal, reading doesn't *interfere* with the sleep cycle as described in the passage.
* **B: Panangusar ti banio ken panagsubli a dagus iti pagiddaan** (Using the bathroom and getting up immediately): This is a normal part of a bedtime routine and doesn't necessarily interfere with the sleep cycle in the way the passage describes.
* **D: Panagriing tapno uminum iti danum a manipud iti botelia idiay nightstand-mo** (Waking up to drink water from a bottle on your nightstand): While waking up to drink water *could* potentially cause a brief interruption, it's not the same as being woken up by an alarm clock in the middle of a sleep cycle.

Therefore, option C is the only one that directly relates to the definition of sleep inertia described in the passage.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a panangiladawan ti pannakaistorbo iti panagturog?,"The correct answer is **A: Mabalin a nakabasar iti biorythm (Can be based on the circadian rhythm)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that one method of sleep restriction involves manipulating the body's natural biological clock (circadian rhythm) by controlling wake times and using external cues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti panggep ket saan a naan-anay a riingem ti bagim (The alarm is not loud enough to wake you up):** This is a description of *how* a sleep restriction alarm works, not a characteristic of sleep restriction itself.
* **C: Ti proseso ket mapasamak bayat ti tiempo ti normal a panagturogmo (The process occurs during your normal sleep time):**  Sleep restriction *manipulates* sleep time, it doesn't simply occur *during* it.
* **D: Kalpasan ti panagriing, ti panggep ket makaturog manen iti uneg ti dua nga oras (After waking up, the person can fall asleep again within two hours):** This describes a potential outcome, but not a defining characteristic of sleep restriction itself.  Sleep restriction aims to *reduce* total sleep time.



"
"Kas ti panagpadas ti utek ti masansan a nalaka a maawatan a tagtagainep, ania iti umadu?","The correct answer is **D: Oras ti nagbaetan dagiti estado ti REM**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kinaadda ti manmano a REM kada rabii, daytoy nga estado a mapadasam no maturogka ken iti bagim ket makaungar agbalin a saan a kanayon ket mabalin a agbalin a problema. Makabannog met la dayto a kasla agriingka iti tunggal duapulo wenno tallopulo a minuto sa agbuya iti TV. **Ti epektona ket nakadepende no mamin-ano nga ipadas ti utakmo ti panagtagtagainep ti nauneg tunggal rabii.**""

This means the *duration* or *interval* between REM cycles is key to the problem.  The passage doesn't mention changes in the *number* of REM cycles (A), brain levels (B), or sleep paralysis (C).
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a negatibo nga epekto nga adda iti bagi ti masansan a nalaka a maawatan a tagtagainep?,"The correct answer is **A: Panangkissay ti kaatiddog ti oras ti nagbaetan dagiti estado ti REM**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti kangrunaan a rason ti daytoy penomenon ket ti resulta dagiti nauneg a tagtagainep nga agwaras iti kaatiddog ti oras ti nagbaetan ti estado ti REM.""  This means the disruption of the time spent in REM sleep is the primary reason for experiencing sleep paralysis.

While options B, C, and D are related to REM sleep, option A is the *direct* cause mentioned in the text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano nga agpada dagiti gagangay a grupo ken birtual a grupo?","The correct answer is **A: Agpadada a manamnama a mangaramid iti agpada a lebel**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti pinartuat a grupo ket addaan iti agpada a pagalagadan a kas gagangay a grupo..."" (Virtual groups have the same goals as traditional groups...). This directly indicates that virtual groups are expected to achieve the same level of performance or outcome as traditional groups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agpadada nga agduduma ti lebel ti autonomiada iti inaldaw-aldaw a rutina:** The passage doesn't mention differences in autonomy between traditional and virtual groups.
* **C: Agpadada nga agipadamag iti saan a makitkita a manangimaton a grupo:** While the passage discusses the ""invisible group"" concept in virtual groups, it doesn't claim traditional groups are the same. It highlights a distinct characteristic of virtual groups.
* **D: Agpadada nga agtrabaho iti agpada a time zone:** The passage explicitly mentions time zone differences as a challenge for virtual groups, meaning they *don't* work in the same time zone.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng a maipapan kadagiti pisikal ken birtual a grupo ti saan a pudno?","The correct answer is **B: Ti birtual a grupo ket agtrabtrabaho a kas punto ti panagsarita para kadagiti gagangay a grupo.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Dagiti miembro ti birtual a grupo ket agtrabtrabaho a kas punto ti panagsarita para iti kangrunaan a pisikal a grupoda."" (Members of a virtual group work as a talking point for their primary physical group.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti gagangay a grupo ket kadawyan a tenglen ti nangatngato a pagalagadan** (High-performing groups are typically a source of greater achievement). While the text mentions high-performing groups, it doesn't say this is a common *difference* between physical and virtual groups.
* **C: Ti gagangay a grupo ket basbassit ti autonomiada ngem ti birtual a grupo** (High-performing groups have less autonomy than virtual groups). The text doesn't make a direct comparison of autonomy between the two group types.
* **D: Ti agduduma a time zone ket mabalin a pagunggonaan dagiti birtual a grupo** (Different time zones can be overcome by virtual groups). The text mentions time zones as a challenge for virtual groups, not something they easily overcome.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a banag a naisentroan dagiti content a teorya?,"The correct answer is **C: Nainternalisa a kasapulan (Internalized needs)**.

Here's why:

* **Content theories** focus on *what* motivates people. They explore the fundamental needs and desires that drive behavior.
* **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs** and **Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory** are prime examples of content theories, as they specifically identify core human needs (like physiological, safety, belonging, esteem) and factors that influence job satisfaction/dissatisfaction.
* **Internalized needs** (a person's deeply held values and beliefs) are more aligned with **process theories** or **humanistic theories** which examine *how* motivation develops and is expressed. Content theories are less concerned with the process and more focused on the underlying needs themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Dagiti baro a tarigagay a makairuaman ti panagtaeng (New technologies that enhance living)** - This is related to the *context* of motivation, not the core needs themselves.
* **B: Kasano a tignayen ti aglawlaw dagiti garawda (How to manage daily routines)** - This is about *behavioral patterns* and *time management*, not the underlying motivations.
* **D: Panangtarus dagiti kagustuan ti tattao (Fulfillment of people's desires)** - While fulfillment is a result of meeting needs, the *theory* itself focuses on *identifying* the needs, not just their fulfillment.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a banag ti annuroten dagiti maikatlo?,"The correct answer is **A: Agparnuay ti linia a batayan ti pangikabilan ti kangrunaan a banag**.

Here's why:

The prompt states that the most effective place for the main subject's viewpoint is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds.  Option A directly reflects this: ""Agparnuay ti linia a batayan ti pangikabilan ti kangrunaan a banag"" which translates to ""Arrange the lines that define the frame of the main subject.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Agparnuay ti biag ken pigsa iti uneg ti imahen** (Arrange life and vitality within the image): While important for a compelling image, this isn't specific to the rule of thirds.
*   **C: Pagtalinaeden a ti kangrunaan a banag ket idiay naisalumina ken epektibo a lugar** (Ensure the main subject is in a bright and effective place):  While good composition considers lighting, the rule of thirds focuses on *placement* rather than lighting.
*   **D: Mangrukod iti kinaurnos ti uneg ti ladawan** (Emphasize the context within the image): This concerns surrounding details and background, not the main subject's positioning according to the rule of thirds.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a mangiladawan ti panangretrato a 35mm ti format na?,"The correct answer is **B: Sinurot isuda ti kamera a digital dagiti format.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what *doesn't* describe a 35mm format portrait.**  The question is asking for something that's *not* true of the 35mm format.
* The passage explicitly states: ""Kinapudnona, ti 35mm a pormat ket maka-allilaw, 36mm ti kinaakabana ken 24mm ti kangatona. Ti ratio daytoy a porma (ti tunggal rukod ket i-divide iti 12 tapno maala ti kabassitan a buo a numero) ket maibaga a 3:2. Adu a gagangay a format (pamilia ti format nga APS, kas pagarigan) ket maipada wenno asideg a mainaig iti daytoy nga aspect ratio.""  This means the 35mm format *is* still used.
* **Option B** states that digital cameras have superseded these formats. While digital cameras are prevalent, 35mm film (and formats based on it) are still used, especially in photography. So, this is *not* a characteristic that *doesn't* describe a 35mm format portrait.
* **Option A** (Maparpartuat pay laeng ita - ""Still used today"") describes the 35mm format accurately, not something that *doesn't* describe it.
* **Option C** (Addaan dayta iti naiduma nga aspect ratio ngem iti adu a gagangay a format - ""It has a different aspect ratio than many common formats"") describes the 35mm format accurately, as it is 3:2, which is different from many common formats.
* **Option D** (Isu ti kagagangay a format iti lubong - ""It is the most popular format in the world"") is incorrect, as digital formats are far more common now.



Therefore, the statement that is *not* a characteristic of the 35mm format is that digital cameras have replaced it.

"Segun iti mabasa, bayat ti panangpangato ti agpatpataud ti kalidad ti produksion ti lente, kasano a napsayaat dagiti lente ti zoom?","The correct answer is **A: Addanda ti nangatngato a kapartak ti lente (Advanced lens technology)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that zoom lenses are more complex than prime lenses due to the number of elements required to achieve a wider zoom range. However, it also says that advancements in lens manufacturing have made zoom lenses capable of producing high-quality images, comparable to prime lenses.  This advancement is the result of advanced lens technology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nalaklakada nga usaren iti saan unay a nalawag a kondision (Easily used in low-light conditions):** The passage mentions that zoom lenses often have smaller apertures, making them less ideal for low-light situations without a flash.
* **C: Ti kalidadda ti ladawan ket umasping iti lente nga addaan ti di makuti a kaadayo ti pokusna (Image quality is superior to lenses with a fixed focal length):** The passage acknowledges the difficulty in achieving equal image quality with zoom lenses compared to prime lenses, especially in terms of aperture.
* **D: Basbassit ti kinakumplikado ti pokusna ngem kadagiti primo a lente (Focus complexity is less than prime lenses):** The passage explicitly states that zoom lenses *are* more complex to focus than prime lenses.



"
"Segun iti impormasion iti mabasa, kaano a nasaysayaat ti lente ti zoom ngem ti primo a lente?","The correct answer is **C: No saanmo a kayat nga agusar ti flash iti nasipsipnget a lugar.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that zoom lenses often have smaller maximum apertures compared to prime lenses. 
*  This is a problem for photographers who want to shoot in low-light conditions without using a flash.
* The question asks how zoom lenses compare to prime lenses, and the passage highlights the smaller aperture as a key difference that makes zoom lenses less desirable for low-light photography.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: No ipangpangruna ti kadadakkelan nga aperture:** The passage says zoom lenses *often* have smaller apertures.
* **B: No kayatmo ti basbassit nga elemento iti lente:** The passage states that the complexity of the elements in a zoom lens contributes to its larger size.
* **D: No agsapsapulka ti nakumkumplikado a pokus:** The passage mentions that zoom lenses can have more complex focusing mechanisms, but doesn't frame this as a major disadvantage compared to prime lenses. It even states that lens design is improving.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a nakanatad a panangiladawan ti Mistisismo?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti mamati ti Mistisismo ket agsapsapul ti siririing a kapuotan ti espiritual a kinapudno (Mystical experiences do not require a strict spiritual doctrine)**.

Here's why:

* **Misticism is defined by direct, personal experience.** It emphasizes a direct encounter with the divine or ultimate reality *beyond* intellectual understanding or adherence to dogma. 
* **A strict spiritual doctrine would be antithetical to the core of mysticism.** Mystics often question or transcend established doctrines in their pursuit of direct experience. They prioritize the lived experience over adhering to a prescribed set of beliefs.
* **Options A and C are accurate.** Mystical experiences *do* often involve altered states of consciousness (like those described) and intentional practices to facilitate those experiences.
* **Option D is also accurate.** The direct personal encounter is what differentiates mysticism from other forms of religious belief.



Therefore, the statement that mystical experiences *require* a strict spiritual doctrine is incorrect.  It undermines the very essence of mystical practice.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a pokus ti Mistisismo?","The correct answer is **B: Panangsurot iti pannakaawat babaen kadagiti nabingbingay, komunal a padas.**

Here's why:

The definition of mysticism emphasizes **direct, personal experience** of the divine. Options A, C, and D all relate to this direct experience:

*   **A: Panagsapsapul ti intuision ti realidad ti dibinidad:**  Intuition is a direct form of knowing.
*   **C: Ti panagpaganetget iti naragsak nga estado ti kapuotan:**  Mysticism explicitly mentions ecstatic states of union.
*   **D: Panangsurot ti siririing a kapuotan ti Dios:** This aligns with the core goal of seeking union with the ultimate reality.

Option B, however, focuses on **received knowledge and communal practices** (like divine revelations and communal rituals). This is *contrary* to the mystical emphasis on individual, direct experience. Mysticism rejects relying on intermediaries or communal authority to access the divine.

Therefore, mysticism is *not* focused on receiving knowledge through revelations or communal practices.

"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti nangrugi ti kagimongan ti agrikultura?","The correct answer is **C: Tattao a Maori a naggapu iti Polynesia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Iti maikasangapulo ket siam ken maikaduapulo a siglo, pattien a dagiti immun-una a nagtalinaed idiay New Zealand ket dagiti Maori, a naganup kadagiti higante a billit a maawagan moa. Dayta a teoria ket nangipasdek iti kapanunotan a dagiti tattao iti Maori ket immakarda a naggapu iti Polynesia iti Dakkel a Barko..."" 

This directly indicates that the Maori arrived from Polynesia.  While the text also mentions the Moriori, it doesn't link them to the origin of agriculture. The text focuses on their distinct cultural development *after* arriving in the Chatham Islands.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti grupo a naganup kadagiti moa ket immun-una a nagtalinaed ti ania a lokasion?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

The text states: ""Pattien a dagiti immun-una a nagtalinaed idiay New Zealand ket dagiti Maori..."" which translates to ""It is believed that the first settlers in New Zealand were the Maori..."".
"
Iti ania nga eksena a ti panangusar iti wagas a Pureland ti origami ket mangbenepisio ti nagkupin?,"The best answer is **B: Ti agkupkupin ket addaan ti naiyuna a panaggaraw.**

Here's why:

* **The description of Pureland origami emphasizes its simplicity and the importance of a single color.** This suggests the finished origami is often decorative and not meant to withstand harsh conditions.
* **The text mentions it was created to help people with disabilities or those who are not very skilled.** This implies the origami is meant to be a manageable, potentially delicate, object.
* **Option B, ""Ti agkupkupin ket addaan ti naiyuna a panaggaraw,"" aligns with this delicate nature.**  Origami made with a single color and simple folds is unlikely to be robust enough to handle outdoor exposure.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ti agkupkupin ket ipangpangrunana ti mangaramid ti adu a kulpi iti mammaminsan.**  While it *is* used to make multiple units, the emphasis is on *how* it's made (simple folds) rather than its durability.
* **C: Ti agkupkupin ket agararmid ti origami a kasapulan ti pabaliktad a kulkulpi.** The description *specifically* states that complex folds like reverse folds are *not* possible in Pureland origami.
* **D: Ti agkupkupin ket naminsan wenno namindua laeng a pinadas dayta sakbayna.** This doesn't connect to the origami's fragility or intended use.



Therefore, the most logical scenario where Pureland origami would be *beneficial* (despite its limitations) is in situations where it's used for decoration and protected from the elements.  The origami might be used as part of a larger display, perhaps indoors, or in a sheltered outdoor area.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti Pureland origami?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti kulpi ket addaan ti diretso a lokasion.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""amen a kulpi ket addaan diretso nga lokasionda"" which translates to ""all the folds have a straight location.""
* **Option A is incorrect:** While the origami *can* be used for prosthetics, the passage states it was *intended* to help those with disabilities or injuries.  The focus isn't *only* on prosthetics.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The passage states that complex folds like reverse folds *cannot* be made, not that the method isn't applicable to them.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The passage states it's good for those who are *not* very dexterous, implying it's *not* specifically tailored to those with severe disabilities.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text is that the folds always have a straight location."
"Segun iti paset, ania a lokasion ti saan a mainaig ti Sibilisasion iti Indus Valley?","The correct answer is **B: Karayan Sarasvati**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uray no pattapattaen dagiti dadduma nga iskolar nga agsipud ta adda met sibilisasion kadagiti tantanap ti namagaan itan a Karayan Sarasvati, maiparbeng a maawagan daytoy a Sibilisasion ti Indus-Saravatsi...""  This indicates that while the Sarasvati River Valley *might* have had a civilization, the primary civilization discussed is the Indus Valley Civilization, and the text focuses on the Indus River as the central geographical feature.  The passage doesn't explicitly say the Sarasvati civilization is *not* part of the Indus Valley Civilization, but it's presented as a separate possibility, not the core focus. The other options are all locations directly associated with the Indus Valley Civilization.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nadakamat a posible a nagan para iti Panawen ti Bronse a napagsasaritaan iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **D: Sibilisasion iti Indus Valley**.

The text explicitly states: ""Iti Sibilisasion iti Indus Valley ket maysa a sibilisasion idi Panawen ti Bronse..."" which means the Indus Valley Civilization is the name being discussed.  All the other options are also mentioned in the text as alternative names or related to the same civilization.

* **The passage states:** ""Addanto a kanayon kadatayo ti kinaagum ken kinamanagimbubukod ket isu ti nakairuaman a panagkakadua a no ti ad-adu ket agganab kanayon nga ad-adunto ti magun-od iti apagbiit babaen ti panagbalin a managimbubukod."" (Continuously emphasizing greatness and exclusivity leads to a shared understanding where a majority tends to focus on short-term gains due to a focus on exclusivity.)  This implies that focusing on exclusive interests *limits* perspective and shortens the focus.

* **Option B directly relates to this:**  ""Panangipangpangruna ti bukod nga interes"" (Prioritizing exclusive interests) is the cause of the limited short-term thinking described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pannakipaset kadagiti dadduma (Cooperation with others):** The passage contrasts exclusivity with cooperation, suggesting that exclusivity *hinders* good outcomes, not the other way around.
* **C: Panagpaganetget no ania ti makagunggona iti minoria ngem iti kaaduan (Prioritizing what benefits the minority over the majority):** While this could be a form of exclusivity, the passage doesn't directly link it to the short-term focus.
* **D: Panangbigbig a ti kinaagum ket mabalin a makagunggona (Emphasizing greatness can be beneficial):** The passage argues the opposite - that *overemphasizing* greatness (and exclusivity) has negative consequences.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mabalin nga ipangpangruna ti maysa no ti pokusda ket dagiti dagus a pagimbagan?","The correct answer is **D: Kinamanagimbubukod**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Addanto a kanayon kadatayo ti kinaagum ken kinamanagimbubukod ket isu ti nakairuaman a panagkakadua a no ti ad-adu ket agganab kanayon nga ad-adunto ti magun-od iti apagbiit babaen ti panagbalin a managimbubukod."" This translates to: ""It is important for us to continuously cultivate greatness and **self-centeredness** which leads to a strong unity because if many people continuously act with self-centeredness, they will quickly fall into conflict due to turning into self-centered individuals.""

The question asks what is primarily the case if the focus is on immediate responses. The passage directly links continuous self-centeredness to quick conflict. Therefore, self-centeredness is the primary factor.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kinaawan ti panagimbubukodan (Lack of cooperation):** While related, the passage highlights self-centeredness *leading to* a lack of cooperation. Self-centeredness is the root cause.
*   **B: Panagtitinnulong (Helping):** The passage contrasts self-centeredness with cooperation, not helping.
*   **C: Panagkakadua (Unity):**  The passage implies that self-centeredness *destroys* unity, not that it *is* the primary focus if responding quickly.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti nangsaklaw iti dakkel a paset dagiti gastos iti gubat?","The correct answer is **C: Ti kolonial a rehimen ti U.S.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Binayadan met la a bukbukod dagiti Filipino dagiti nagastos iti gubat ti imperialismo ti U.S. ... Napilitanda nga agbayad kadagiti buis...tapno mabayadan ti kadakkelan a paset dagiti gastos ken dagiti interes...babaen kadagiti banko ti Wall street.""  It then clarifies that the profits from exploiting Filipinos were the main source of income for U.S. imperialism. This indicates that the *U.S. colonial regime* was responsible for the majority of the war expenses.

While the Philippines *paid* the taxes, the passage emphasizes that the U.S. *reaped* the profits from the exploitation and ultimately bore the financial responsibility for the war's costs.
"
Ania a periodo ti panawen ti dimteng sakbay ti panawen dagiti Templar?,"The correct answer is **A: Tawtawen a Late Middle Age**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the High Middle Ages were from 1000-1300 AD.
* The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages, and lasted until 1500. 
* The Knights Templar were active during the High Middle Ages. 
* Therefore, the period encompassing their existence falls within the Late Middle Ages.



The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maika-12 a siglo** (12th Century) is only a part of the High Middle Ages, not the encompassing period.
* **C: Tawtawen a Early Middle Age** (Early Middle Age) predates the High Middle Ages significantly.
* **D: Maika-13 a siglo** (13th Century) is also only a part of the High Middle Ages, not the encompassing period.



"
Ania a periodo ti panawen ti dimteng kalpasan ti panawen dagiti Templar?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Late Middle Ages**.

The provided text states that the High Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries) preceded the Late Middle Ages (after 1500). Therefore, the period *after* the Templar era (which falls within the High Middle Ages) would be the Late Middle Ages.
"
Ania a medikal a panangagas wenno pamay-an ti saan a nadakamat ti paset kas us-usaren dagiti doktor ken siruhano bayat ti Imperio ti Roma?,"The correct answer is **A: Panangagas iti post-traumatic stress disorder babaen ti nadumaduma a sedatives.**

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions various sedatives used by Roman doctors, including morphine and scopolamine.** While these could have helped with pain and anxiety, the passage doesn't explicitly state they were used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
* **B: Panangusar kadagiti extract ti bukel ti herbane para iti scopolamine:** This is true, the passage *does* say this. However, the question asks for a *medical treatment* or *method*. Using scopolamine extract is a method, but it doesn't fully encompass a treatment for a specific condition.
* **C: Pananglapped iti panagayus ti dara babaen kadagiti pangipit ti urat:**  While the passage mentions methods to improve blood circulation, it doesn't directly state this as a treatment for a specific condition like PTSD.
* **D: Panangaramid kadagiti pannakaputed ti bagi para kadagiti pasiente a gangrene:** This is true, the passage *does* say this. However, the question asks for a *medical treatment* or *method*. Performing amputations is a method, but it doesn't fully encompass a treatment for a specific condition.

Although options B, C, and D are all mentioned in the text, option A is the most logical answer because it connects the use of sedatives (a method) to a potential treatment for a psychological condition. The passage highlights the use of sedatives, implying their application in managing various ailments. PTSD is a condition that could potentially benefit from the calming effects of sedatives, even if it wasn't specifically documented as such.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nainaig kadagiti irarang-ay a naaramid iti tay-ak ti medisina bayat ti Imperio ti Roma?","The correct answer is **C: Ti pannakabukel dagiti pagadalan nga ospital (The establishment of road hospitals)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * Emperor Augustus funding doctors and establishing the first Roman Medical Corps.
    * Surgeons using sedatives like morphine and scopolamine.
    * Surgical procedures to prevent gangrene, blood clots, and other complications.

* **The passage does NOT mention:**
    * Road hospitals.  While the Romans were excellent engineers and built roads, the text doesn't state they established hospitals *along* those roads. The focus is on a dedicated medical corps and surgical practices.

Therefore, option C is the only one not supported by the information provided in the text.
"
Ania ti pagdependian ti abilidad a makakita?,"The best answer is **B: Dagiti kasapulan ti maysa nga organismo (The needs of an organism)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...nakadepende ti kinakomplikadona iti kasapulan ti organismo..."" (its complexity depends on the needs of the organism). This directly points to the answer being related to the organism's requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

* **A: Iti organ a pangrikna ti sistema bisual wenno dagiti mata (On the sensory organ of the visual system or the eyes):** While the eyes are involved, the passage emphasizes that the *complexity* of vision depends on the organism's needs, not just the existence of the eye.
* **C: Maysa a sensibilidad iti sumagmamano a wave-length (A certain sensitivity to certain wavelengths):** This is a component of vision but not the overarching dependency mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Agsasabali a digri ti katadem (Different degrees of intensity):**  Intensity is also a component, but the passage highlights the broader dependence on the organism's needs for the complexity of vision.



Therefore, the most accurate and comprehensive answer is **B**."
Ania ti agpannuray ti panagduduma ti istruktura ti mata iti nagbaetan dagiti organismo?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti kasapulan ti organismo (The needs of the organism)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the different eye structures depend on the organism's needs. It mentions that the complexity of eyes varies based on what the organism requires. Options A, C, and D are not directly mentioned as the primary drivers of structural differences in eyes according to the passage. While wavelength sensitivity might be *a* factor, the passage emphasizes the overarching role of the organism's needs.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng maipapan iti Sikhismo ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan iti relihion?","The correct answer is **A: Ti Sikhismo ket resulta ti sektariano a panagsisina iti uneg ti tradision dagiti Hindu.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Namungay idiay rehion ti Punjab agdama iti 15 a siglo gapu iti panagsina ti sekta iti uneg ti tradision ti Hindu."" (It originated in the Punjab region in the 15th century due to sectarian strife within the Hindu tradition.)

Let's look at why the other options are not the *most* accurate answer to the question of what the passage *doesn't* say:

* **B: Ti guru ket maysa a kangrunaan nga aspeto a naisangsangayan iti Sikhismo:** The passage *does* say the guru is a fundamental aspect.
* **C: Siamna a guru ti simmaruno kalpasan ti nangipasdek iti relihion, ni Guru Nanak:** The passage *does* mention nine gurus after Guru Nanak.
* **D: Ti sumagmamano a tradision ti Sikhismo ket nairamut iti Hinduismo:** The passage *does* say the Sikh religion is a result of sectarian strife *within* Hinduism, implying a connection to it.



Therefore, the only statement that is *not* explicitly mentioned or directly implied as being absent from the description in the passage is option A.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maibilang a kangrunaan nga aspeto ti sistema ti pammati dagiti Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Ti konsepto ti guru**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ti guru ket pundamental nga aspeto ti amin a relihion idiay India ngem ti Sikhismo innalana ti kinapateg a mangporma iti tengnga ti pammati ti Sikh."" (The guru is a fundamental aspect of all religions in India, but Sikhism gave prominence to the concept of the guru as forming the center of Sikh belief.)

While the other options are mentioned as aspects of Sikhism, the guru is specifically highlighted as the *most* central and defining element of their belief system according to the text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a marigatan nga ipamaysa dagiti ubbing nga addaan iti Sakit iti Panagkurang iti Atension?","The correct answer is **A: Trabaho idiay eskuela**.

The text specifically states: ""Dagiti ubbing nga adda ADD na ket marigatan nga agpokus kadagiti banbanag a kas iti trabaho idiay eskuela..."" (Children with ADD have difficulty focusing on tasks like work in school...).

While the text mentions children can focus on enjoyable activities, it highlights the difficulty with schoolwork as a key characteristic of ADD. Options B, C, and D are mentioned as things they *can* focus on, not things they struggle with.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, apay a dagiti ubbing nga addaan iti Sakit iti Panagkurang iti Atension ket agannayas a makipaset kadagiti napeggad a kababalin?","The correct answer is **D: Tapno maparegtada ti utekda**.

The text states: ""Gapu ta addaanda kadagiti napeggad a galgalad, makiramramanda kadagiti panagaapa, ken karitenda ti autoridad tapno maparegtada ti utekda, ta saan a maparegta dagiti utekda babaen iti normal a panglakagan."" (Because they have impulsive tendencies, are easily distracted by stimuli, and challenge authority in order to regulate their brains, because their brains cannot be regulated by normal means.)

This directly explains why children with ADD try to push boundaries - it's to try and regulate their brains.
"
"Segun iti impormasion iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti saan a pagarigan ti andamio?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a bassit a coach ti liga (A simple league coach)**.

Here's why:

* **The text defines scaffolding as a support system for learning.** It emphasizes helping individuals learn new skills.
* **Options A, B, and C all represent forms of support for learning:**
    * **Tutorial for learning to ride a bike:** Provides step-by-step instructions and guidance.
    * **SAT tutor:** Offers specialized instruction and support for a specific test.
    * **Independent learning program:** Provides structured lessons and exercises to aid understanding.
* **A simple league coach is not primarily focused on skill-building or learning a new concept.** A coach focuses on improving performance in an existing skill, not typically on teaching a fundamentally new skill or concept. While a coach *could* provide encouragement and guidance, that doesn't fit the definition of scaffolding as a support system for *learning*.

Therefore, a simple league coach is the least aligned with the concept of scaffolding described in the text.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti konsepto ti andamio?,"The correct answer is **D: Mausar dagiti andamio a mangitukon iti suporta iti rugi ti padas ti panagsursuro.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that scaffolding is a ""tulong a mangted ti suporta kadagiti indibidual nga agad-adal ti baro a kapadasan."" This aligns directly with option D.  Scaffolding provides support to navigate the complexities of learning.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **A: Mabalin nga adda dagiti birtual nga andamio:** While true (mentioned in the passage), it's a *result* of scaffolding, not the core definition.
* **B: Ad-adda a tulong daytoy ngem maysa a wagas ti panagadal:** The passage says it's *not* just a learning method; it's a support *system*.
* **C: Pagaammo met daytoy kas nakabasar iti proyekto a pannakasursuro:**  While scaffolding *is* used in project-based learning, the definition goes beyond just being tied to a project. It's about providing structured support for learning new skills.



Therefore, option D best captures the essence of what scaffolding (and the concept of ""andamio"" in the passage) *does* – it provides support to navigate the learning process."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a langa ti MySpace ti mabalin a makagunggona kadagiti estudiante a marigatan nga agbasa?","The correct answer is **C: Maysa a direksion ti web**.

The passage specifically states: ""Mabalinmo a sukatan tapno nalaka a basaen wenno adda ti ad-adu wenno basbassit a kulay no kayatmo. **Maysa a direksion ti web, a palakaenna a malagip ken nalaka nga i-type para kadagiti estudiante a marigatan a mangusar ti keyboard wenno ti speling.**"" (You can adjust to make it easier to read by having more or less color if you want. **A web font that makes it easier to find and type for students who have trouble using a keyboard or spelling.**)

Options A, B, and D are incorrect based on the text provided.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a paset ti sungbat ni Khrushchev kadagiti riribuk dagiti trabahador?","The correct answer is **C: Paaduen ti kaltas iti sahod**.

Here's why:

The text states that the workers protested *because* of low food and wages.  Krushchev *did* address the economic issues and promised to improve the economy (D). He also used tanks to restore order (B) and appointed Gomulka as Prime Minister (A). He didn't *increase* wages; he was responding to the existing problem of low wages and food shortages. Therefore, option C is the statement that is **not** part of Khrushchev's response.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakaigapuan ti riribuk idiay Poland?,"The correct answer is **D: Pannakaidutok ni Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the protests initially started over food shortages and low wages (B and C).
* Krushchev initially tried to suppress the protests with tanks.
*  He *did* eventually appease the protesters by installing Wladyslaw Gomulka as Prime Minister (mentioned in the text).
* Therefore, the protests *did* lead to the appointment of Gomulka, making option D the *incorrect* choice - it was *achieved* during the unrest, not something that was *not* achieved. 

The other options (Komunismo, Kaawan ti makan, and Kaltas iti sahod) were all factors that *did* contribute to the unrest."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nangapektar iti relasion ti USSR ken USA?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti panagsusupiat maipapan kadagiti sistema** (Disagreements about systems).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that after WWII, the existing systems (political and economic) of the USSR and USA were fundamentally different. This difference in ideology led to the Cold War.
* The text mentions that despite the war ending, the systems weren't reconciled, leading to lasting tensions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti pinagdumaanda iti kultura (Cultural differences):** While cultural differences existed, the text focuses on the clash of political and economic systems as the primary driver of the Cold War.
* **B: Opinion maipapan iti Germany (Opinions about Germany):** Germany's fate and division *were* a significant factor in the post-war tensions, contributing to the Cold War's beginnings. The text mentions Germany as one of the arenas of conflict but not the core reason for the Cold War itself.
* **C: Dagiti agduduma a proseso (Different processes):** This is too vague. The ""processes"" likely refer to political and economic processes, which fall under the broader category of system differences.

Therefore, the disagreement about the fundamental systems of the USSR and USA is the most direct and accurate answer according to the provided text."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan iti panggep ti panangipatulod kadagiti impulses ti nerbo iti buo a bagi?,"The correct answer is **B: Panangtarawidwid iti pannagna ti dara (Blood circulation)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *doesn't* directly relate to the transmission of nerve impulses through the entire body to maintain blood flow. Let's break down the options:

*   **A: Panagpabannayat ti pannagna ti dara (Blood clotting):** While blood clotting is important for stopping bleeding, it's not directly involved in the transmission of nerve impulses.
*   **B: Panangtarawidwid iti pannagna ti dara (Blood circulation):** This is the *primary* function that the nerve impulses are meant to regulate.  The nerve impulses *control* blood circulation, ensuring it continues uninterrupted.  Therefore, it is NOT something that is being described as a result of the nerve impulse transmission, but rather the system that the nerve impulse is managing.
*   **C: Panagtalinaed ti homeostasis (Homeostatic regulation):** Homeostasis is the maintenance of a stable internal environment. Nerve impulses *contribute* to homeostasis, but it's a broader concept than just the transmission of impulses for blood flow.
*   **D: Panangliklik kadagiti mabalin a pangta ti bagi (Vasoconstriction of blood vessels):** This is a *result* of nerve impulse transmission. Vasoconstriction (narrowing) is a way the body can regulate blood flow, but it's not the overarching concept that the nerve impulses are transmitting *through* the body.



Therefore, **Panangtarawidwid iti pannagna ti dara (Blood circulation)** is the best answer because it describes the system that the nerve impulses are intended to regulate and maintain, and isn't a direct result of the nerve impulse transmission itself."
Ania ti masarakan idiay Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Amin dagiti pito a nakaskasdaaw**.

The passage states: ""Ti Giza Plateau...addaan iti sumagmamano a piramide (a ti naindaklan a piramide ti kadakkelan), sumagmamano a babassit a tantanem, sumagmamano a temtemplo, ken ti naindaklan nga Sphinx."" This means the plateau contains all of those things, including the seven pyramids.
"
Ania ti panggep ti Dakkel a Piramid?,"The correct answer is **B: Tapno mapadayawan ti maysa a Faraon (To honor a Pharaoh)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Iti dakkel a piramida ket naaramid tapno mapadayawan ni Parao Khufu..."" (The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...).
"
Asinno ti makagapu iti pannakaammotayo iti nangpuor a nangdadael iti templo?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks who recorded the name of Herostratus.** The passage states, ""Insurat ti Griego a historiador a ni Strabo dayta a nagan kas pagaammotayo itan."" (The Greek historian Strabo wrote down his name, which is how we know it today.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti Ephesian:** The Ephesian people were the ones who *witnessed* the destruction, but they didn't record Herostratus's name. They were outraged by his act.
* **B: Alejandro a Dakkel:** Alexander the Great offered to rebuild the temple, but he didn't record Herostratus's name.
* **D: Artemis:** Artemis was the goddess the temple was dedicated to, and she wasn't involved in recording the event or the perpetrator's name.



"
Ania ti umiso a keddeng maipapan iti pannakaaramid manen ti templo ni Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Naaramid manen dayta kalpasan ti panagturay ni Alejandro a Dakkel.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ni Alejandro, kas ari, indiayana ti agbayad tapno maaramid manen ti templo, ngem saan a napatgan ti diayana. Idi kuan, kalpasan a matay ni Alejandro, naaramid manen ti templo idi 323 BCE.""

This clearly indicates the temple was rebuilt *after* Alexander the Great's death. Option A is incorrect because Alexander didn't pay for the rebuilding, and option C is incorrect because Herostratus was responsible for the destruction, not the rebuilding. Option D gives an incorrect date.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano ti kaunaan a mabalin a nagna ti maysa a sebbangan iti dua a saka?","The correct answer is **A: Pito milion a tawen ti napalabas**.

The text states: ""uray no ti Sahelanthropus ket mabalin a nagna iti dua a sakana iti kas kasapa a pito a milion a tawen ti napalabas."" (even though Sahelanthropus could have lived as early as seven million years ago.)
"
Ania kadagitoy a sebbangan ti regular a magmagna iti dua a saka?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti bipedal nga espesialisasion (Bipedal specialization)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for a *characteristic* that is regularly found in the fossil record.** The passage states that the ability to walk upright (bipedalism) is a key characteristic of hominins and was evident in fossil Australopithecus.  The passage also highlights the importance of bipedalism in the evolution of hominins.
* **The passage directly links the fossil record of Australopithecus to the evolution of bipedalism.**  The discovery of Australopithecus fossils demonstrates the emergence of this characteristic.
* **Sahelanthropus** is mentioned as potentially being *earlier* than Australopithecus, but the passage doesn't say it regularly exhibits bipedalism in its fossils. It's less certain.
* **Homo Erectus** is mentioned as appearing later and being a descendant of hominins who had already developed bipedalism.
* **Australopithecus** *developed* bipedalism, but the question asks for a characteristic *found* in fossils.  Bipedalism *is* the characteristic.

Therefore, ""Dagiti bipedal nga espesialisasion"" best describes a regular characteristic found in the fossil record as discussed in the passage.



"
Ania ti padpadasen nga aramiden ti armada ti Germany bayat ti WWII?,"The correct answer is **A: Pananglapped kadagiti tagilako nga aggapu idiay Britania.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ti German navy, nga agus-usar laeng ti bangka nga U, padpadasenna a pasardengen daytoy a trapiko.""  This translates to: ""The German navy, using only U-boats, aimed to intercept this traffic.""  The ""traffic"" refers to the ships carrying supplies from Britain to the Allies (including the US).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pananglapped iti Britania nga umawat kadagiti tattao ken tagilako** - This describes what the Allies were trying to do, not what the German navy was doing.
*   **C: Panagbiahe kadagiti materiales iti ballasiw ti Atlantika** - This describes the movement of supplies, not the German navy's *aim* during WWII.
*   **D: Pananglapped ti Amerika nga umawat kadagiti tattao ken tagilako** -  The text focuses on the traffic *from Britain*, not from America.



"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, asinno ti kaaduan ti balligi iti gubat ti naval bayat ti Kampanya iti Amianan nga Atlantika?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti Briton ken Dagiti Amerikano**.

The passage explicitly states that the campaign was about the Allies (Britons and Americans) trying to protect convoys sailing across the Atlantic to help Britain. It also highlights the German U-boat campaign to sink those convoys. Therefore, the fighting was primarily between the British and Americans *against* the Germans.

While the Germans were actively fighting, the core of the Allied effort and the central conflict described revolves around the actions of the British and Americans.
"
Ania ti awan idi impatungpal dagiti Assyrian ti panagusar iti cavalry?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti silla (Saddles)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Assyrians used cavalry (soldiers riding horses) around 1000 B.C.  However, it also mentions they *didn't* have saddles yet. The lack of saddles meant the horses weren't properly protected and the riders couldn't effectively control them, leading to the cavalry's limitations.

The passage highlights the importance of the pannakaimbento (invention) of the rider's backrest (which eventually led to saddles) in enabling effective cavalry. The other options are either things they *did* have or things that would have aided, not hindered, cavalry use.
"
Kasano a malabanan dagiti gubat nga agus-usar iti calvary?,"The correct answer is **C: Nakasakay iti kabalio (Riding horses)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that the Assyrians used cavalry (soldiers fighting on horseback) around 1000 B.C.  It then goes on to describe how their cavalry was effective. Therefore, the answer to the question ""How did they fight wars using cavalry?"" is ""Riding horses.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iti saka (In the front)** - While cavalry could attack from the front, this isn't the defining characteristic of fighting *with* cavalry.
*   **B: Awan ti kabal (Without horses)** -  The passage specifically says they *did* use horses for cavalry.
*   **D: Iti basbassit a suldado (With infantry)** - Cavalry and infantry are different units. The question is about how *cavalry* is used.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ti saanmo a pakasarakan iti gagangay nga umili ti Babilonia?","The correct answer is **D: Panangiyeg kadagiti isakripisioda iti akin-uneg a santuario**.

Here's why:

The text states: "" Kada templo ket addaan nakalukat nga arubayan sa maysa nga akin-uneg a santuario a dagiti laeng padi ti makaserrek."" (Every temple had a raised platform with a secret inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.)

The question asks where people *could not* participate in the offerings. The text implies that regular people were not allowed in the inner sanctuary. Options A, B, and C all describe places where offerings *were* made or observed. Option D accurately reflects the information provided.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti espesipiko a nairanta para kadagiti papadi?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti seremonia**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dagiti tattao kadagiti isakripisioda kadagiti didiosen ket padasen met dagiti papadi a maited dagiti kasapulan dagiti didiosen babaen kadagiti **seremonia** ken piesta."" 

This translates to: ""The people, due to the sacrifices they offer to the gods, also allow the priests to provide the necessities of the gods through **ceremonies** and festivals.""

While the other options are related to the temple and priests, the passage directly links priests to ceremonies.
"
Kaano a nakagun-od ti kinalatak ni Ari a Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **C: Kalpasan ti pannakatakuat ti tanemna**.

The passage states: ""The interesting thing is that he was not considered important in ancient times and was not listed in the lists of kings. However, he became famous after the discovery of his tomb in 1922.""

Therefore, his fame and importance grew *after* his tomb was discovered.
"
Ania ti namagbalin ken Ari a Tutankhamun a nalatak nga ari ti Ehipto?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti pannakatakaw ti rinibu nga artifact manipud iti tanemna.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Idinto nga adu a tanem ti nataktakawan iti naglabas, agarup saan a pulos a nasingsinga daytoy a tanem. Naipreserba a nalaiang ti kaaduan kadagiti bambanag a naikali a kadua ni Tutankhamun, pakairamanan ti rinibribu nga artefact a naaramid iti napapateg a metal ken manmano a batbato."" This means the discovery of the tomb and its contents is what made Tutankhamun famous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti pannakatakuat iti di nariribuk a tanemna:** While the tomb was undiscovered for a long time, the *discovery* itself is what made him famous, not the fact that it was undiscovered.
* **B: Ti kasasaadna kadagiti kadaanan a listaan ti ari:** The passage says he wasn't even listed in the traditional lists of pharaohs, so this is incorrect.
* **D: Ti kaipapananna bayat dagiti kadaanan a panawen ti Ehipto:** The passage doesn't mention his significance during his lifetime; it was his tomb's discovery that made him famous.



"
Ania ti saan a kabaelan nga aramiden ti Griego a mannaniw a ni Homer?,"The correct answer is **D: Makasarita (Tell stories)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Homer was a ""legendary storyteller"" and the author of the *Iliad* and *Odyssey*. The question asks what he *couldn't* do. Since his defining characteristic was storytelling, it logically follows he *couldn't* do something *other* than tell stories. The other options (hear, see, understand) are all things a person can do, and don't contradict the passage's description of Homer.



"
Ania a nalatak a Griego ti pagaammo gapu iti sabali malaksid iti literatura?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

Here's why:

*   **Pythagoras** is renowned for the Pythagorean theorem, a fundamental concept in mathematics. While the others were great writers, Pythagoras is specifically known for his mathematical contributions.

Let's look at why the others are less accurate:

*   **Sophocles** and **Aristophanes** were both famous playwrights (writers of plays).
*   **Homer** is famous for the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*, epic poems.



"
Sadinno ti nangbusbosan ti Hebreo a pamilia iti kaaduan a tiempoda?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti awanan linong**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kaaduan iti panagbiag dagiti Hebreo a pamilia ket napasamak ti awanan linong."" (Most of the life of the Hebrew families happened in the open air/without a home).
"
Ania ti saan unay a napateg iti pamilia Hebreo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti pagtaenganda (Their comfort/well-being)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a harsh environment: hot climate, lack of shade, and simple living conditions.  It emphasizes the difficulty of daily life. While the other options are mentioned, the central theme is the *lack* of comfort and well-being.  The passage highlights the challenges they faced in simply surviving, not enjoying a comfortable existence.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ti klimada (The climate):** The climate is mentioned as a hardship, not something they prioritized.
*   **B: Dagiti istoriada (Their stories/history):** The passage doesn't mention stories or history.
*   **D: Ti panaglutoda (Their cooking):** Cooking is described as a basic activity, not a priority or source of comfort.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nailadawan a nagdumaan dagiti pagilian ti Scandinavia?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti kaugalian**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""adu a nagdudumaan dagiti tattao, ar-ari, kaugalian ken pakasaritaan iti Denmark, Sweden, Norway ken Iceland."" This means that customs (kaugalian) are one of the differences among the Scandinavian countries. The passage also mentions differences in people (tattao), royalty (ar-ari), and history (pakasaritaan), but it directly mentions customs as a distinct differentiating factor.
"
Asinno ti immuna a nagnaed idiay Greenland?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti tribo ti Eskimo**.

The passage states: ""Uray no ti sagmamaysa a pagilian ket “Scandinavian”, adu a nagdudumaan dagiti tattao, ar-ari, kaugalian ken pakasaritaan iti Denmark, Sweden, Norway ken Iceland. **Uray awan ti pannakadiskubrena, dagiti tribo ti Eskimo ket agtaltalinaed idiayen idiay a kanito.**"" This indicates that the Eskimo tribes were already inhabiting Greenland before the Norse arrived.
"
Ania a grupo ti kaykayat a mangan nga awan ti tugaw?,"The correct answer is **C: Nabaknang a lallaki a Romano**.

The passage states: ""dagiti baknang a lallaki ket kayat da nga adda bangketeda a mabalin a sala a pagurayan idiay igid bayat a mangmanganda."" which translates to ""the wealthy men liked to have a couch to lean on at the edge of the bay while eating."" This implies they were the ones who enjoyed eating without having to stand.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a paset ti maysa a piesta dagiti nagkakauna a Romano?,"The correct answer is **D: Maysa a plato ti naituno a pabo (A plate of roasted turkey)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the Romans didn't have turkey, and weren't as reliant on it as Europeans later became. 
* The passage mentions boar, dormouse, and other foods were served at Roman feasts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nakurapay a sangaili a mangmangan kadagiti tugaw (Roasted dormouse eaten in a grape sauce):**  The passage mentions dormice as food at Roman feasts.
* **B: Maysa a pangpangan ti birurukong (A boar dish):** The passage mentions boar as a food at Roman feasts.
* **C: Nabaknang a lallaki a nakaidda bayat ti pangrabii (Wealthy men lying down during the feast):** The passage mentions wealthy men having couches to recline on during feasts.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nalabit nga addaan iti mataginayon nga epekto?","The correct answer is **B: Maysa a minoria a kultura**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Masansan a mapukaw dagiti minoria a kultura nga awan mabatida a napateg a napnuan pakasaritaan nga ebidensia ket saan ida a mabigbig a kas naan-anay a sibilisasion.""  This directly translates to: ""Often minority cultures without significant historical evidence are not considered to be true civilizations.""

Therefore, the passage implies that minority cultures *lack* the enduring impact or evidence to be classified as a civilization, while the other options (civilization, city-state, and civilization culture) *are* associated with civilization.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti umun-una ngem ti maysa a nasion?","The correct answer is **A: Maysa a kultura ti sibilisasion**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ti sibilisasion ket maysa a kultura a pinagraraman ti nangruna a grupo ti tattao nga agbibiag ken agtitinnulong nga agobra, maysa a kagimongan."" (Civilization is a culture formed by a main group of people who live and work together, a settlement.)
* The question asks for the primary thing a civilization is. The passage directly identifies it as a culture.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maysa a singular a kultura** (A single culture): While a civilization *has* a culture, it's not just a single culture. It involves a larger group and complex societal structures.
* **C: Maysa a siudad-estado** (A city-state):  City-states were *early examples* of civilizations, but the civilization itself is more than just a city-state.
* **D: Maysa a minoria a kukultura** (A minority subculture): Civilizations are formed by the *main* group of people, not minority subcultures.



"
Ania a keddeng maipapan iti Drukgyal Dzong ti saan a pudno?,"The correct answer is **C: Dinadael ti uram ti adu kadagiti relikya ti sarikedked.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Idi 1951, maysa nga uram ti nangigapu a dadduma laeng kadagiti reliko iti Drukgyal Dzong ti naibati, kas ti imahe ni Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel."" (In 1951, a portion of the relics from Drukgyal Dzong was stolen, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.)
* **Option C accurately reflects this theft.** The other options are either true or not directly supported by the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naaramid dayta tapno maramrambakan ti balligi dagiti puersa ti Tibet-Mongol:**  The text says it was built to *resist* the Tibetan-Mongol forces, not to *strengthen* their power.
* **B: Masarakan dayta idiay Bhutan:** The text says it is now a major tourist attraction in Bhutan, but it doesn't say it was initially a social center.
* **D: Daytoy ket inaramid ni Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** The text states that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was involved (his image was stolen), but it doesn't explicitly state that he *built* the Dzong. While he was a key figure, the text doesn't say he was solely responsible for its construction.



"
Ania a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan iti nagbanagan ti uram idiay Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **B: Nagballigi dagiti puersa ti Tibet-Mongol**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the looting in 1951 was *in response to* the weakening of the Tibetan-Mongol forces. This implies that the weakened forces were a key factor that enabled the looting to occur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti laeng nabati a relikya ket ti ladawan ni Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal:** While the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was taken, the question asks for the *cause* of the looting, not just what was taken.
* **C: Saan a naapektaran ti kinalatak ti atraksion:**  The looting *did* impact the Dzong's appeal as a tourist attraction.
* **D: Daytoy ket napreserba babaen ken ni Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** The passage mentions Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the Dzong, but doesn't link his preservation efforts to the looting event itself.



Therefore, the weakening of the Tibetan-Mongol forces is the most direct cause of the looting described in the passage.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan iti Cambodia ti pudno?,"The correct answer is **D: Dinadael dagiti Thai ti Phnom Penh**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Niraut dagiti Thai ti Cambodia iti mano nga ulit idi ika-18 a siglo... idi 1722 dinadaelda ti Phnom Phen."" This directly translates to ""The Thai invaded Cambodia repeatedly in the 18th century... in 1722 they sacked Phnom Penh.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dinadael dagiti Vietnamese ti Phnom Penh:** The passage says the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia *at the end* of the 18th century, not that they sacked Phnom Penh.
* **B: Rinaut ti Cambodia ti Thailand idi 1772:** The passage mentions the Thai invaded Cambodia in the 18th century, but not specifically in 1772. It only states that they invaded repeatedly.
* **C: Ti Cambodia ket rinaut da dagiti Vietnamese idi rugi ti maika-18 a siglo:** The passage states the Vietnamese invaded *at the end* of the 18th century, not at the beginning.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan kadagiti panagraut ti Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti Thai ken Vietnamese rinautda ti Cambodia idi 1772**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Niraut dagiti Thai ti Cambodia iti mano nga ulit idi ika-18 a siglo...Idi maudi a taw-tawen ti maika-18 a siglo, dagiti taga-Vietnam nirautda met ti Cambodia.""
* **Option B accurately reflects this:** It mentions both the Thai and Vietnamese invasions and provides a year (1772) consistent with the text's timeframe (late 18th century).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Namin-adu a rinaut dagiti Vietnamese ti Cambodia:** While the passage mentions Vietnamese invasions, it doesn't explicitly state that they were more frequent than Thai invasions.
* **C: Dinadael dagiti Vietnamese ti Phnom Penh:** The passage says Phnom Penh was conquered by the Thai in 1722, not conquered by the Vietnamese.
* **D: Namin-adu a rinaut dagiti Thai ti Cambodia:** The passage states that both Thai and Vietnamese invaded, it doesn't claim that the Thai invaded more often.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga inaramid ti Dutch East India Company bayat ti kaaddada idiay Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **B: Panagpraktis ti panagpataud ti aborihinal a bukbukel (Practicing the enslavement of indigenous people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Dutch East India Company *changed* the practices of the indigenous people and *employed* Chinese laborers. It does *not* say they practiced enslavement.  While their actions undoubtedly impacted the indigenous population, the passage doesn't explicitly mention enslavement.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Addaan iti batayan iti abagatan a laud a paset ti isla (Had a base in the southwestern part of the island):**  The passage directly states this.
* **C: Mangpatrabaho kadagiti trabahador a Tsino kadagiti plantasionna (Employed Chinese laborers in their plantations):** The passage states this.
* **D: Situtulok nga ited ti panangtengngel ti Taiwan iti dinastia ti Qing (Relinquished Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty):** The passage states this happened in 1895.



"
Ania ti impasdek ti Katulagan ti Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti autoridad ti Japan iti Taiwan**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed in 1895, resulted in the Qing government ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. This directly led to Japan gaining authority and control over the island until 1945.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti pannakaabak ti Japan iti Umuna a Gubat a Tsina ken Japan** - While the war *caused* the treaty, the treaty itself is the specific event answering the question.
* **B: Ti kasasaad ti Taiwan kas probinsia iti sidong ti dinastiya ti Qing** - This happened *before* the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The treaty ended Qing rule.
* **C: Kabaelan ti Taiwan a mangtengngel manen kadagiti lugarna iti igid ti baybay** - The treaty *prevented* Taiwan from remaining in Qing control and instead placed it under Japanese authority.



"
Kasano a maammuan ti lebel ti pH iti kemikal?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti dagup dagiti ion ti Hydrogen iti kemikal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Maammuan ti nibel ti pH babaen kaadu ti bilang dagiti ion ti Hydrogen (ti H iti pH) iti naamiris a kemikal."" 
* **pH is defined as a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+).**  The higher the concentration of H+ ions, the more acidic the solution. The lower the concentration, the more alkaline (basic) the solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kasano kabasiko wenno kaasido iti kemikal:**  This describes whether a substance is acidic or basic, but not how to *measure* the pH.
* **B: Kasano kaadu dagiti proton iti kemikal:** While hydrogen ions (H+) are protons *without* electrons, the passage specifically refers to *hydrogen ions* (H+), not just protons. The concentration of H+ ions is what determines pH.
* **D: Kasano kaadu dagiti elektron iti kemikal:** The number of electrons has no direct relationship to pH.  pH is about hydrogen ions.



"
Ana iti inikkat gapu dagiti ion ti Hydrogen?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti proton**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maammuan ti nibel ti pH babaen kaadu ti bilang dagiti ion ti Hydrogen (ti H iti pH) iti naamiris a kemikal. Dagiti ion ti hydrogen ket dagiti proton a naawanan iti elektron..."" 

This clearly indicates that hydrogen ions (H+) are protons that have lost an electron.  Therefore, the answer is protons.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti grupo iti leon?,"The correct answer is **D: Pada a makapapatay ken nasayaat ti pannakikaduada**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agtignay dagiti grupo ti leon a kas met laeng kadagiti grupo dagiti lobo wenno dagiti aso, ay-ayup a makapasiddaw a kapada dagiti leon (ngem saan dagiti dadduma a dadakkel a pusa) iti galadda, ken napeggad pay unay para kadagiti biktimada.""

This translates to: ""Groups of lions act just like groups of wolves or dogs, very capable of attacking (but not other large cats) in a pack, and very good at hunting their prey.""

Option D directly reflects this capability and skill in hunting. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

* **A: Mangtignayda nga umasping kadagiti aso** (They act like dogs) - This is true, but not a *keddeng* (characteristic) that *allows* the group to function.
* **B: Ti annugat ti lalaki ken babai ket saan a agpagisu** (The relationship between male and female doesn't matter) - The passage says the females are closely related, suggesting relationships *do* matter within the group structure.
* **C: Amin dagiti lallaki ken babbai ket asideg nga agkakabagian** (All males and females are closely related) -  While females are closely related, the passage doesn't state that *all* males and females are closely related.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagtignay iti leon?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti panagtignayda ket maipumadpad iti kadagiti lobo**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Dagiti grupo ti leon a kas met laeng kadagiti grupo dagiti lobo wenno dagiti aso, ay-ayup a makapasiddaw a kapada dagiti leon (ngem saan dagiti dadduma a dadakkel a pusa) iti galadda, ken napeggad pay unay para kadagiti biktimada.""  This means their behavior is comparable to wolves and dogs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nasayaat ti pannakikaduada:** While being a good hunter is part of their nature, the text doesn't specifically highlight *hunting* as the primary behavior to understand them.
* **C: Agpada dagiti lallaki ken babbai ket makapapatay unay iti kanenda:** The text mentions that the males are responsible for defending the pride and hunting, while the females primarily raise the cubs. It doesn't state they equally participate in killing prey.
* **D: Ti panagtignayda nga umasping kadagiti dadduma a dadakkel a pusa:** The text specifically says they are *not* like other large cats.



"
Dagiti kuneho ket kadawyan a kanen ti ania a klase a manangraut?,"The correct answer is **A: Babbabassit a pusa**.

The passage states: ""Adu pay ti babassit a pusa (agraman dagiti bulos a taraken a pusa) a mangmangan iti adayo ken ad-adu a babassit nga animal a kas insekto, utot, alutiit, ken billit. Ti sikreto ti panagballigida ket ti konsepto ti niche, maysa a espesial nga obra nga iggem dagiti pusa a saan a mangipalubos nga aglalabanda."" 

This indicates that small cats (bababassit a pusa) are known to eat rabbits.
"
Ti babbabassit a pusa ket aganup ti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **A: Ut-utot**.

The passage explicitly states that small cats eat small animals like ""utot"" (which translates to rodents or similar small mammals). While they *can* eat rabbits, antelope, and hares, the passage highlights a broader diet of smaller creatures including rodents.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a paset ti pamay-an ti panaganup iti ocelot?,"The correct answer is **A: Ag-camouflageda iti aglawlawda (Camouflaging in tall grass)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that ocelots are skilled hunters because of their sense of smell and ability to stalk prey. It also mentions they are nocturnal and agile.
* While ocelots *might* blend into tall grass to some extent, the passage *doesn't* specifically mention camouflage as a key part of their hunting strategy. The other options are directly supported by the text.
*  The passage clearly states they use their sense of smell (angot) and hunt at night (rabii).
* The text also mentions they target small prey (basbassit nga ayup).



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A** because the passage doesn't directly state camouflage is a hunting tactic.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ti riknada ti angot ket nakapsut** (Their sense of smell is keen).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Dandani amin nga ay-ayup a tiltiliwen ti ocelot ket basbassit nga amang ngem iti daytoy. Panunoten dagiti sientipiko a dagiti ocelot surutenda ken biruken dagiti animal a kanenda (prey) babaen ti angot, agsinglot iti no ayanna da iti daga."" (Scientists have noted that ocelots hunt and eat animals by scent, sniffing the ground for them.) This clearly indicates a keen sense of smell.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Makaanupda a nalaing iti rabii** (They are nocturnal): The passage mentions they are good at seeing in the dark, but it doesn't say they are nocturnal.
* **B: Makagunayda a sililimed** (They are agile): The passage states they are agile, but it doesn't say it's *not* a characteristic they possess.
* **D: Kaykayatda nga aganup iti babassit nga ayup** (They prefer to hunt small animals): The passage confirms they eat small animals, but it doesn't say it's *not* a characteristic they possess.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a kadakkelan a pigsa iti tigre?,"The correct answer is **A: Panag-agdaranudor (Hunting)**.

The text explicitly states the tiger *can* hunt, but it is not mentioned as a characteristic that makes them exceptionally powerful or unique. The other options (panaguli - swimming, panaglagto - jumping, panagguyod - strength) are all highlighted as abilities of the tiger, and are more closely tied to the question of their strength and capabilities.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania iti subang a nagbaetan dagiti tigre ken leon?","The correct answer is **B: Ti uni ti daranudorda**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Anger ti tigre ket saan a kas iti buo a boses a panagngernger ti leon, ngem kasla a sentensia nga adda nauyong, maipukkaw a sarsaritana.""  This directly compares the roar of a tiger to the roar of a lion, highlighting the difference in their vocalizations.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti kabaelanda nga aglangoy:** Both tigers and lions can swim, the text mentions it for tigers but not a distinguishing factor between the two.
* **C: Ti distansia ti panaglagtoda:**  The text mentions tigers can leap long distances, but doesn't compare this to lions.
* **D: Ti pigsa ti panagguyodda:** The text states tigers have the strength to carry five times a person's weight, but doesn't compare this to lions.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti inaramid ni Robert Hooke sakbay ti dadduma a biologo?","The correct answer is **A: Nangpaliiw kadagiti natay a selula**.

The text states: ""Isuna ti kaunaan a tao a nangpaliiw kadagiti natay a selula."" (He was the first person to explain dead cells.)  While he observed the cells in cork, the key point is that he *explained* them, which implies understanding their nature.
"
Ania ti kayatna a saoen ti naggapuan ti sarita a “selyula”?,"The correct answer is **B: Bassit a kuarto**

The text explicitly states: ""Iti selula ket naggapu iti sao Latin a cella a kayatna sawen bassit a kuarto."" This translates to ""The word 'cell' comes from the Latin word 'cella' which means small room.""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaaduan ti ayup ti addan ti abilidad nga ania?","The correct answer is **B: Aggaraw**.

The passage states: ""Dagiti ayup laeng ti adda utekna (nupay saan nga amin nga ayup ketdi; kas pagarigan ti jellyfish, awan utekna). **Kaaduan nga ayup ket makagaraw.**"" (Only animals have brains (although not all animals do; for example, jellyfish have no brain). **Most animals can fly**.)

While the passage mentions animals can swim, crawl, and climb, it explicitly states that most animals can fly (aggaraw).
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti awan ti sumagmamano nga ayup?","The correct answer is **C: Utek**.

The text states: ""Dagiti ayup laeng ti adda utekna (nupay saan nga amin nga ayup ketdi; kas pagarigan ti jellyfish, awan utekna)."" which translates to ""Only animals have brains (though not all animals do; for example, jellyfish have no brain).""

Therefore, the answer is that some animals (like jellyfish) **lack brains**.
"
Ania ti mangtulong kadagiti mula ti proseso iti photosynthesis?,"The correct answer is **D: Init**.

Here's why:

* **Photosynthesis** is the process where plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their food (sugars) and release oxygen. 
* The question specifically asks what helps plants with photosynthesis. 
* **Sunlight** is the essential energy source for this process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Linong (Air):** While plants *use* carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis, air itself isn't the *helper* for the process.
* **B: Ay-ayup (Animals):** Animals benefit from plants, but they don't directly aid in photosynthesis.
* **C: Makan (Food):** Plants make their own food through photosynthesis; they don't need food to perform the process.



"
Ania ti iruar dagiti tao a lang-aben dagiti mula?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon dioxide**.

The text states: ""Agparnuay dagiti mula iti oxygen nga ang-angsen dagiti tao, ken agalada iti carbon dioxide nga iruar dagiti tao..."" which translates to ""Plants take in the oxygen exhaled by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans...""

Therefore, carbon dioxide is what humans exhale that plants use.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a pagarigan ti mangabbeng ti proseso ti ebolusion?","The correct answer is **C: Ti populasion a mangmangibagay ti pakairuamanda iti baro nga aglawlaw.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a new population needs **different adaptations or innovations** to survive in a new environment with different resources and selective pressures.  Option C directly reflects this need for adaptation to the new environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti bassit a grupo ket saan a nakabiag a nasayaat iti baro a lokasion:** The passage states the *new* population faces this challenge, not the original small group.
* **B: Ti paset ti maysa a populasion nga umakar ti baro nga aglawlaw:** This describes the formation of a new population, but not the *process* of evolution itself.
* **D: Maysa a populasion a nangbukel iti dua:** While speciation *results* in two populations, it's not the primary driver or condition for the evolutionary process described in the passage.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti proseso iti panag-sebbangan? ,"The correct answer is **A: Isu ti mapasamak no ti baro a populasion ket saan a nakairuaman**.

Here's why:

The text describes speciation as the process of a new species arising. It explicitly states that the new population needs **different adaptations or introductions** to survive in a new environment, implying that they **cannot simply remain the same as the original population**. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isu ti napateg a aspeto ti proseso ti ebolusion:** While speciation is a *significant* aspect of evolution, the question asks for something that *doesn't* shed light on the *process* of speciation itself. This option is a general statement about evolution, not specific to the speciation process.
* **C: Saoenna ti pannakabukel ti baro a sebbangan:** This is a *result* of speciation, not a factor that *doesn't* shed light on the process. The question asks what *doesn't* explain speciation.
* **D: Ti pasamakna ket saan a maliklikan:** The text states, ""Saan a maliklikan a resulta ti speciation ket maysa daytoy a napateg unay a paset ti ebolusion,"" meaning the outcome of speciation *is* a significant and noticeable part of evolution.

Therefore, the key factor that prevents a new population from simply remaining the same and *does not* shed light on the speciation process is that **the new population needs to be isolated (not interbreed) to diverge and eventually become a new species.** This is implied by the text's discussion of adaptation and introduction to a new environment."
Ania a paset iti sistema ti panagbalikuskos ti mangiyeg ti dara papan ti puso?,"The correct answer is **D: Veins**.

The passage states: ""Ti dara ket pumanaw aggapo iti puso idiay tubo a maawagan **veins** ken agsubli iti puso manipud iti tubo a maawagan a arteries."" (The blood leaves the heart through tubes called veins and returns to the heart through tubes called arteries.)

Therefore, veins are the vessels that carry blood *back* to the heart.
"
Ania ti sangkabassitan a tubo ti sistema ti panagbalikuskos?,"The correct answer is **A: Capillaries**.

The passage states: ""Ti sangkabassitan a tubo ket maawagan a capillaries."" (The smallest tubes are called capillaries.)
"
Ti abilidad ti insekto a mangkupin kadagiti payyakda a mangisubli a paurnos ket mangpaadu ti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti espasio ti paglemmengan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that insects use their ability to hide from predators to find ""nalawlawa a lugar tapno makalemmengda kadagiti mabalin a mangan kadakuada."" This translates to ""unfamiliar places to look for potential food.""  Hiding from predators allows them to survive and access these places, essentially securing them as places to live (or ""paglemmengan"" in the provided options).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Suplay ti makan:** While hiding *helps* with food, it's not the *direct* benefit mentioned. The passage links hiding to finding places to look for food.
*   **C: Panagsapul ti kapareha:**  The passage doesn't mention a connection between predator avoidance and finding mates.
*   **D: Kapartak ti tayab:** The passage describes the ability to fly as a means of escaping predators, not as a result of avoiding predators.

Therefore, the ability to hide leads to better access to and security in places where insects can find shelter, making option B the most logical conclusion.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nadakamat ti paset kas a banag nga apektado iti abilidad ti insekto a tumayab?,"The correct answer is **C: Panagsapul ti makan (Need for food)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti abilidadda a tumayab ti nakatulong kadakuada tapno nadardaras a makalibas kadagiti kalabanda ken epektibo a makasapul ti makan ken kapareha."" (The ability to fly helped them to spread pollen and effectively find food and mates.) This directly links flight to finding food.
* **The question asks:** What part of the insect's life cycle is *not* affected by the ability to fly?
* **The passage emphasizes the impact of flight on finding food.**  The other options are directly related to the benefits of flight:
    * **Panangpaganak (Reproduction):**  Flight helps insects find mates and spread pollen, which is essential for reproduction.
    * **Kabayag ti biag (Longevity):**  While flight might indirectly contribute to survival by allowing escape from predators, it doesn't directly impact lifespan.
    * **Kabaelan (Mobility/Agility):**  Flight is a form of mobility and agility.

Therefore, **Panagsapul ti makan (Need for food)** is the only option that isn't explicitly stated to be aided by the insect's ability to fly. The ability to fly helps insects find food, so their need for food is directly affected.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a kababalin ti saan a gagangay a nainaig kadagiti dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **A: Akinlikud a magmagna (Bipedal locomotion)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that some dinosaurs used ""dua nga akinlikud a sakada a kas ti T-Rex"" (two hind legs like the T-Rex) to move. This refers to bipedalism – walking on two legs.  The passage contrasts this with the common perception of dinosaurs as being large, scary, and terrifying.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Dudutdot (Sharp teeth):** While some dinosaurs had sharp teeth, the passage doesn't highlight this as a unique or unusual ability.
*   **C: Panagitlog (Egg-laying):**  Many reptiles and birds lay eggs, so this isn't a particularly special feature of dinosaurs.
*   **D: Nagkuko dagiti saka (Claws on feet):** Many reptiles and birds have claws, so this isn't unique to dinosaurs either.

Therefore, **bipedalism (walking on two legs)** is the most distinctive and often underestimated ability of dinosaurs mentioned in the passage."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a gagangay a maibilang a nabingbingay a kababalin dagiti billit ken dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **A: Panagitlog dagiti itlog**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that birds are considered the direct descendants of dinosaurs and share many characteristics with them, including laying eggs.** This makes it a common and widely accepted trait shared with dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate based on the passage:

* **B: Usaren ti dua nga akinlikud a saka tapno magna:** The passage mentions this specifically in relation to T-Rex, a larger dinosaur. While some smaller dinosaurs *might* have had similar adaptations, it's not a universally shared characteristic of all or even most small dinosaurs.
* **C: Ti abilidad nga agtayab:** The passage indicates that many people don't think of dinosaurs as being capable of flying due to their size and strength. This implies that flying wasn't a common trait among most dinosaurs.
* **D: Saka nga addaan kuko:** While many dinosaurs likely had claws, the passage doesn't highlight claws as a defining or widespread characteristic shared with birds. It focuses more on other more significant evolutionary connections.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania a paset ti mula a cycad ti mabalin a kanen ti Triceratops?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti natangken a bulong (The hardened cones)**.

The text states: ""Dagitoy a mulmula ket aglanglanga a kas bassit a niog nga adda ti koronana a natadem, ken natatarid a bulbulong."" (These plants resemble small coconuts with a crown-like top and hardened cones.) And later: ""Mabalin nga inusar ti Triceratops ti napigsa a sippitna tapno ikkaten dagiti bulbulong sakbayna a kanen ti sanga."" (The Triceratops may have used its strong beak to bite and eat the cones along with the branches.)
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kaaduan a mabalin a kanen ti maysa a Triceratops? ","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a mula nga addaan iti makasabidong a prutas**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, which are cone-bearing plants with hard, ridged cones.
* The passage explicitly mentions that Triceratops might have used their beak to break open the cones to eat the seeds. 
* It also notes that other animals like sloths and parrots are known to eat hard, fibrous fruits and nuts. 

Therefore, option D accurately reflects the passage's information about the type of food Triceratops might have consumed. The other options are incorrect based on the text:

* **A: Maysa a sloth** - While sloths eat hard fruits, the passage doesn't say Triceratops ate sloths.
* **B: Maysa a mula nga addaan kadagiti natangken a sanga** -  While Triceratops ate branches, the passage focuses on the cones/seeds, not just the branches.
* **C: Maysa a parrot** - Parrots eat fruits, but the passage doesn't say Triceratops ate parrots.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga isports ti nalabit a nasaknap a nalatak kadagiti makin-amianan unay a rehion ti Italia?","The correct answer is **D: Karera ti motor ti F1**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Kalalatakan dagiti isport a pang-winter kadagiti Umamianan a rehion, ket dagiti Italiano ti makisalsalisal kadagiti internasional a paay-ayam ken kadagiti pang-Olympics a paspasamak."" This translates to: ""Winter sports are prevalent in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympics.""
* The question asks which sport is *most* commonly known as popular in the Northern regions.
* The text specifically mentions Formula 1 (F1) motor racing as one of the popular sports. While not explicitly stated as a winter sport, it is a major international sport where Italians are known to excel.
* Snowboarding isn't listed in the text.

Therefore, **D: Karera ti motor ti F1** is the best answer based on the information provided.
"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga isports ti nangabak iti kampeonato ti lubong para iti Italia?","The correct answer is **A: Football**.

The text states: ""Ti maikadua a kababalligian a grupo ti sangalubongan ket isuda dagiti kampeon iti FIFA World Cup idi 2006."" (The second-best national team in the world is they are the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.)  And the text also lists football as a popular sport in Italy. This directly links football to a World Cup championship for Italy.

The other options are not mentioned in the text as having been won by Italy.
"
Kalpasan ti ania a pasamak a nagbalin a Belgian ti dadduma a paset ti Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti Rebolusion ti Belgium**.

The passage states: ""Dagiti agdama a parte ti Belgium ket parte ti Luxembourg idi un-unana ngem nagbalin a parte ti Belgium kalpasan ti rebolusion idiay Belgium idi 1830."" (The original parts of Belgium were part of Luxembourg initially but became part of Belgium after the revolution in Belgium in 1830.)
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nangapektar iti neutralidad ti Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti panangsakup dagiti German**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about factors *affecting* Luxembourg's neutrality.** While the other options are historical events related to Luxembourg, they didn't directly *affect* its neutrality in the way the German occupations did.
* **The text states that Luxembourg was occupied by Germany in both World Wars.** This directly violated its neutrality.
* **The other options are less directly related:**
    * **B: Pannakikadua iti European Union:**  Luxembourg's membership in the EU *demonstrates* its continued commitment to a peaceful and cooperative international environment, but it doesn't inherently *affect* its neutrality.
    * **C: Ti Rebolusion ti Belgium:** This event *led to* Luxembourg becoming part of Belgium initially, and later influenced its relationship with Belgium, but doesn't directly explain the factors *affecting* its neutrality.
    * **D: Agbalin nga agwaywayas a pagilian:** The text indicates Luxembourg has consistently been a neutral nation. 

Therefore, the German occupations were the most direct and significant factor impacting Luxembourg's neutrality.



"
Mano a kilometro kuadrado ti dagup a kalawa ti Turkey idiay Europa?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""Ti kalawa ti Turkey, kadua dagiti danaw, agnanaed iti 783,562 kuadrado a kilometro (300,948 sq mi), nga iti 755,688 kuadrado a kilometro (291,773 sq mi) ket adda idiay abagatan a laud ti Asya ket 23,764 kuadrado a kilometro (9,174 sq mi) ket adda idiay Europe.""
"
"Segun iti paset, agarup mano a milia ti kaatiddog ti Turkey?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The passage states: ""Ti teritoryo ti Turkey ket nasurok a 1,600 kilometro (1,000 milya) kaatiddog..."" which translates to ""The territory of Turkey is approximately 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) in length...""
"
Para iti ania ti panagusar ti Latin a pagsasao iti Siudad ti Vatican?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti relihioso a seremonia**.

The text states: ""Latin met ti masansan a mausar kadagiti relihioso a seremonia."" which translates to ""Latin is also frequently used in religious ceremonies.""

While Latin is used in official contexts (D), the text specifically highlights its use in religious ceremonies. It is *not* used as a daily language (B) or in the legislature (C).
"
"Iti Siudad ti Vatican, ania iti saan a pagusaran ti Italian a pagsasao?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti relihioso a seremonia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Italian ti usar ti Siudad ti Vatican a pagsasao iti lehislatura ken kadagti opisial a komunikasionda. Ti Italian met ti inaldaw a panagsasao nga us-usaren ti kaaduan kadagidiay agtabtrabaho ket Latin met ti masansan a mausar kadagiti relihioso a seremonia."" 

This clearly indicates that Latin is more commonly used for religious ceremonies in Vatican City, even though Italian is used in other contexts.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mangbenepiso gapu ti panaglalaok ti uni ti sopistikado a kompiuter?","The correct answer is **A: Musika**.

The text states: ""Ti musika ket masansan a mairekrekord babaen kadagiti narikot a kompiuter tapno iproseso ken paglaokenna dagiti uni.""  This directly indicates that music benefits from sophisticated computer processing.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti animasion:** While computers are used for animations, the text doesn't specifically mention music benefiting from animations.
* **C: Dagiti ladawan:** Similar to animations, computers are used for images, but the text focuses on music and image manipulation separately.
* **D: Panangipatakder:**  The text doesn't mention anything about ""panangipatakder"" (which likely means editing or post-production) benefiting from computer-aided audio processing.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, agarup amin a balbalay iti ania a lokasion ti addaan iti mai-flush a kasilias?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage states: ""Addaan iti mai-flush a kasilias iti agarup amin a balbalay kadagiti siudad ti Harappa ken Mohenjo-daro..."" (There were flush toilets in almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro...)

While the passage mentions other locations having toilets, it specifically links the widespread use of flush toilets to Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.
"
Ania iti sumaganad a lokasion ti panagsarakan ti naiyuna a sistema ti pagrugitan?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Addaan iti mai-flush a kasilias iti agarup amin a balbalay kadagiti siudad ti Harappa ken Mohenjo-daro..."" (There were flush toilets in almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro...).  While the passage mentions other locations with toilets, it specifically highlights Harappa as one of the key locations where they were prevalent.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pakaigapuan ti panagturong ti skater?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti dua nga igid ti tadem ti skate.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Gapu ta iti baba ti tadem ket apagapaman a nagkurba, agirig ti tadem iti maysa a bangir wenno iti sabali a bangir, agkurba met ti ikingna a maitama iti yelo.""  This directly links the curvature of the blade (two edges) to the direction the skater turns. The curvature allows the skater to apply pressure to one edge or the other, causing them to turn.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti bassit a kurbada iti baba ti tadem ti skate:** While curvature is involved, the *two edges* are what enable the turning. A simple curve wouldn't provide the necessary leverage.
* **C: Ti pakabuklan a lebel ti paglaingan ti skater:** The skater's balance is important for stability, but it doesn't *cause* the turning.
* **D: Ti kalidad ti yelo:** The quality of the ice affects the skater's speed and control, but it doesn't determine the turning mechanism itself.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a mangiladawan iti abut iti tadem ti moderno nga ice skate?","The correct answer is **B: Nagkurba (Curved)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""gapu ta iti baba ti tadem ket apagapaman a nagkurba, agkurba met ti ikingna a maitama iti yelo."" (because the bottom of the skater is curved, the blade also curves when it's upright on the ice.)

While the other options relate to the shape of the blade, the key takeaway from the text is the **curve** of the blade that allows for turning.  ""Concave"" and ""nagkiling"" (tapered) aren't mentioned as defining features in the context of explaining how the blade allows for turning. The ""dua a igid"" (two blades) is a general fact about ice skates but doesn't explain the mechanism of turning.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti proseso a mangipalubos kadagiti atomo a mangikkat iti sobra nga enerhia manipud iti lawag?","The correct answer is **D: Natignay a panangiruar ti radiasion**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Awagan dagiti sientista daytoy a proseso a “natignay a panangiruar ti radiasion” gapu ta dagiti atomo ket natignay bayat ti nalawag a silaw..."" This directly identifies ""natignay a panangiruar ti radiasion"" as the process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Radiasion:**  While related, ""radiasion"" is a broader term. The question asks for the *process* by which atoms lose energy to light.
* **B: Natignay a panangiruar dagiti photon:** This describes *part* of the process, but not the overall process.  It's about the photons being emitted, not the energy loss itself.
* **C: Photon:** A photon is a particle of light, not the process of energy loss.



"
Ania ti mangigapu iti atomo a mangiruar ti photon?,"The correct answer is **B: Panagtignay gapu iti nalawag a silaw**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dagiti atomo ket natignay bayat ti nalawag a silaw, paggapuan ti iruruar ti photon iti silaw, ken ti silaw ket maysa a wagas ti radiasion.""  This translates to: ""Atoms are excited by light, emitting a photon when the photon is absorbed by the light, and light is a form of radiation.""

Therefore, atoms emit photons *because* they are excited by light. Options A and C are incorrect because the passage links photon emission directly to being excited by light. Option D is too vague and doesn't reflect the specific process described.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti pakaigapuan inton agangay nga agbalin ti bombilia?","The correct answer is **C: Ti filament iti uneg ti bombilia a mapupuoran**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kalpasan ti ginasut nga oras ti operasion ti linabag ti bombilia, agangay a mapuoran ket saanen nga agbalin ti silaw a bombilia. Masapul a masuktanen ti bombilia.""  This directly points to the filament burning out as the reason for the bulb not shining.  The other options are incorrect based on the text:

* **A: Saan nga umiso ti pannakaiddep ti fixture iti silaw:** While a loose fixture *could* cause issues, the passage focuses specifically on the bulb *not* shining.
* **B: Ti kaadda ti metal a base ti bombilia iti paset laeng iti sulbongan:** The text doesn't mention the base itself being the cause.
* **D: Agbannayat ti panagayus ti kuriente iti sulbongan:**  The text focuses on the bulb's filament and not the circuit itself.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mabalin a napeggad a sagiden bayat ti panangsukat iti bombilia?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti filament**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Masapul a masuktanen ti bombilia. Nasisita nga aganannad iti panagsukat ti bombilia."" (The bulb needs to be measured. It is dangerous to measure the bulb.) and ""Ti koriente a magmagna mapan iti sulbonganna no sadino ti ayan ti metal a parte a nakapuestuan ti bombilia ket makaited kenka iti nakaro a pannakakoriente no iggamam dayta makin-uneg a parte iti nagsulbongan wenno dayta metal a nakaimontaran dayta bumbilya bayat nga adda pay isuna idiay nagsulbungan."" (The current that flows to the filament will give you a large electrical shock if you touch the metal part that holds the bulb or the metal part attached to the bulb while it is still in the socket.)

The filament is the thin wire inside the bulb that glows when electricity passes through it. It's the part that carries the current and therefore poses the greatest risk of electric shock.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Ti switch ti silaw:** While potentially involving electricity, it's not directly exposed to the high voltage associated with the filament.
* **C: Ti base ti bombilia:**  The base is generally insulated.  While it conducts electricity to the bulb, it's not the primary danger.
* **D: Ti kable:**  The wires themselves are a danger if exposed, but the passage focuses on the *bulb* specifically.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mapasamak no mabingay ti nucleus?","The correct answer is **B: Mangiparuar iti enerhia**.

Here's why:

The question describes nuclear fission, where a heavy nucleus splits into smaller nuclei. This process *releases* a tremendous amount of energy, as stated in the prompt.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Magun-od dagiti proton:** While some particles might be emitted during fission, the primary outcome isn't protons being released.
* **C: Agbalin a di natalged dagiti atomo:** Fission doesn't typically make atoms ""unstable."" It results in smaller, often more stable, nuclei.
* **D: Mapukaw dagiti neutron:** While neutrons are involved in fission (often triggering it), the primary outcome isn't simply the excitation (energizing) of neutrons. The release of energy is the key result.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mangipakita kadagiti atiddog a distansia nga awag nga agsubli nga agpababa iti Daga,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti sattelite (Satellites)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""P: No tumawagka iti maysa a tao a rinibo a milia ti kaadayona, agus-usarka iti satellite."" (If you want to call someone thousands of miles away, use a satellite.)  This directly links satellites to overcoming vast distances.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Ti sattelite iti law-ang ti mangala iti awagmo sa insigida nga ibatona met laeng iti daga."" (The satellite in orbit receives your call and sends it back to Earth.) This further reinforces the role of satellites in long-distance communication.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Dagiti teleskopio (Telescopes):** Telescopes are used to *observe* distant objects, but they don't transmit signals *to* them.  The passage mentions telescopes are used to look *through* the atmosphere, not to communicate over long distances.
    * **C: Dagiti lawag (Rockets):** Rockets are used to *launch* satellites and telescopes into orbit, but they don't directly transmit or receive signals over long distances.
    * **D: Dagiti rocket (Rockets):** Same reasoning as above.  Rockets are a means of transport, not communication devices.



"
Ania kadagitoy ti mausar a mangikabil iti teleskopio iti law-ang?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti rocket**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Naipan ti satellite iti law-ang babaen ti maysa a **rocket**."" (The satellite was launched into space by a rocket.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti silnag ti lawag (Space debris):** Space debris is a problem for satellites and telescopes, but it's not what *launches* them into space.
*   **C: Ti atmospera ti lubong (The Earth's atmosphere):** The atmosphere interferes with telescopes, which is why they are placed *above* it.
*   **D: Dagiti sattelite a nasurok a 100 feet ti kangatona (Satellites about 100 feet in height):** The passage says a *giant* rocket is needed, not a small satellite, and the height of 100 feet is not relevant to the launch process itself.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text is **B**.



"
Ania ti rumbeng a maipalagip maipapan iti sikliko a pasamak tapno masurot ti panaglabas ti panawen?,"The correct answer is **A: Kinabayag (kaatiddog)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mabalin mo a markaan ti panaglabas ti oras babaen ti panangobserbar kadagiti mauli-ulit a pasamak. Ti siklikal a pasamak ket isu kanayun a maulit-ulit a pasamak. **Kinabayag** ket no kasano met nga iyasping ti kinabayag (kaatiddog) dagiti mapaspasamak.""

This directly connects the concept of cyclical events and the perception of time to *kinabayag* (anxiety/apprehension).  The passage suggests that by understanding the underlying anxiety or apprehension associated with repetitive events, one can better perceive and potentially manage the feeling of time passing.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Panangulit-ulit (Repetition)**: While cyclical events *involve* repetition, the passage isn't suggesting that simply noticing the repetition is the key to managing the perception of time.
*   **C: Affect (Effect)**:  The passage mentions that time affects everything we perceive, but *affect* is a broad term and doesn't pinpoint a specific mechanism for managing time perception.
*   **D: Rigat (Difficulty)**: The passage states that understanding time is difficult.  While this is true, the passage isn't saying that the difficulty itself is the solution to managing time perception.

Therefore, **kinabayag (anxiety/apprehension)** is the most accurate and directly supported answer according to the given passage.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania nga aspeto ti maysa a pasamak ti mausar ti panawen a mangidilig?","The correct answer is **A: Kaatiddog (Intensity)**.

The passage states: ""Ti oras ket no kasano met nga iyasping ti kinabayag (kaatiddog) dagiti mapaspasamak."" which translates to ""Time is also how it is experienced through the intensity of events.""

Therefore, intensity (kaatiddog) is the aspect of an event that influences the perception of time.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maibilang a gagangay para iti agtawid iti trono?","The correct answer is **D: Mapan iti unibersidad sakbay a sumrek iti militar.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that Charles went to university (Trinity College, Cambridge) and got a 2:2 degree in History *before* entering the military.
* The passage highlights this as unusual for someone destined to become King.  The fact that he pursued higher education *before* his military career is the key point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mangurnong ti 2:2 a digri:** The passage mentions he *got* a 2:2 degree, not that it's a requirement.  And it's presented as an unusual path.
* **B: Tallikudanna ti unibersidad tapno makimilitar:** The passage states the opposite - he *went* to university *before* the military.
* **C: Mangadal ti Pakasaritaan:** While he studied History, the passage doesn't say that studying History is a requirement for becoming King.

Therefore, the only option that aligns with the information provided in the text is that Charles went to university *before* entering the military.
"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, ni Charles ti immuna a nangaramid iti ania?","The correct answer is **C: Mangala iti digri**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ni Charles ti umuna a miembro ti Royal a Pamilia a Briton a nakaawat iti digri."" (Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to earn a degree.)
"
Ania a pagilian ti naggapuan ti bunggoy ni Trygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The text explicitly states: ""Daytoy a bunggoy ket indauluan ni Olaf Trygvasson, maysa a **Norwegian** nga adda ambisionna..."" (This raid was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a **Norwegian** who had ambitions...).
"
Iti ania a tiempo iti pakasaritaan a nangipaay ti Germany iti napigsa nga kultural nga impluwensia ti Estonia?,"The correct answer is **C: Agarup 600 a tawenen ti napalabas**.

The passage states ""Idi maika-15 a siglo..."" which translates to ""In the 15th century..."".  The 15th century is roughly 600 years ago (2024 - 1500 = 524, which is close enough to 600 given the wording). The passage details the significant German cultural influence in Estonia during that time.
"
Ti pagsasao nga Estonian ket naimpluensiaan ti ania?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti alpabeto ti German**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Isu nga inimbentoda ti literal a pagsasao nga Estonian. Naibasar daytoy ti alpabeto ti German ket nanayunan ti maysa a letra “Õ/õ”."" This directly translates to ""It invented the literal Estonian language. It was based on the German alphabet and introduced the letter 'Õ/õ'.""

While German monks and their faith were *responsible* for creating the language, the question asks what *influenced* Estonian. The immediate influence mentioned in the text is the German alphabet.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, agbaliwbaliw ti bilang dagiti katutubo nga agsasao iti Hindi base iti ania a banag?","The correct answer is **A: No dagiti dialekto nga umasping unay iti Hindi ket mabilbilang.**

The passage states: ""Ti bilang dagiti katutubo ket mabalin nga agbaliw depende no maibilang dagiti daddumapay nga agiinnasideg a dialekto.""  This directly indicates that the number of Hindi speakers fluctuates depending on how many dialects are considered and counted as part of the Hindi language.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pudno a keddeng maipapan dagiti lengguahe a Hindi ken Urdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Agduduma ti iskripda (They have different scripts)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Agpada ti bokabulario ti Hindi ken Urdu ngem agdumada iti pannakaisurat; no agtungtong dagiti agsasao kadagitoy a pagsasao, gagangay nga agkinnaawatanda. (The vocabulary of Hindi and Urdu are similar but differ in writing; if speakers of these languages read, they will likely understand each other.)""

This clearly indicates the difference in script is a key distinction between the two languages. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga umiso a kinapudno maipapan iti alpabeto a Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti orihinal a nagan ti alpabeto ket Hunan Jeongeum.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks about *unpopular* or *incorrect* common notions.** The other options are all factually correct:
    * **A: Naimbento dayta idi rugi ti panagturay ni Ari Sejong** - This is true.
    * **C: Inimbento dayta ti maikauppat nga ari ti Dinastia ti Joseon** - This is true (Ari Sejong was the 4th Joseon king).
    * **D: Nairanta a naimbento dayta** - This is true.

* **B: Ti orihinal a nagan ti alpabeto ket Hunan Jeongeum** - This is a common misconception. The original name was **Hunmin Jeongeum** (훈민정음). ""Hunan"" is not part of the correct name.

Therefore, option B presents an incorrect common belief about the name of the alphabet.
"
Ti alpabeto a Hunmin Jeongeum ket nabaliwan kamaudiananna iti ania?,"The correct answer is **D: Jeongeum**.

The question asks what Hunmin Jeongeum was later known as. The text states that Hunmin Jeongeum is the original name of the alphabet that is now known as Hangeul. Therefore, it was later known as Jeongeum.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti pagsasao a naimpluensiaan babaen ti Sanskrito?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti pagsasao ti Indiano**.

The text explicitly states: ""The Sanskrit serves as the source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin served as the source for the languages in Europe, such as French and Spanish."" 

While Latin influenced European languages, and Sanskrit influenced Indian languages, the question asks which languages were *influenced* by Sanskrit, and the text clearly states that Sanskrit is a source for modern Indian languages. Therefore, D is the most accurate answer.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti pannakausar ti Sanskrito ket bimmassit gapu iti ania?","The correct answer is **D: Hirarkia**.

The text states: ""Kalpasan a naurnong dagiti Upanishad, nagawan lattaniti Sanskrit gapu iti hirarkia."" This translates to ""After the Upanishads were revealed, Sanskrit became a language of hierarchy.""

While complexity (A) and the Aryan migration (B) influenced Sanskrit, the text explicitly states *hierarchy* as the reason for its development and usage. Latin (C) is mentioned as a comparison, but not as the reason for Sanskrit's rise.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a keddeng maipapan iti grabidad iti Io?","The correct answer is **C: Ad-adda a mangguyod ti grabidad ni Io, isu nga ad-adu koma ti timbangem.**

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states:** ""No tumakderka iti rabaw ti Io, nalaglag-anka...isu a ti gravity, siempre, ket basbassit ti guyodna kenka."" (If you jumped on the surface of Io, you would float...so the gravity, of course, would be weak on you.)
* **The passage also gives a weight comparison:** ""Isu a ti tao nga addaan kadagsen ti 200 a libra (90kg) iti Daga ket agdagsen ti agarup 36 a libra (16kg) idiay Io."" (A person weighing 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth weighs only about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io.)

This means that while gravity *is* present on Io, it's much weaker than on Earth.  Therefore, your weight would be significantly less. Option C accurately reflects this relationship: the gravity of Io *does* pull on you, but your weight is less because of its weaker pull.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Basbassit ti mangguyod kenka ti grabidad ti lubong ngem ti grabidad ni Io:**  The passage doesn't say the gravity on Earth is weak. It's comparing the gravity on Io to Earth.
* **B: Ad-adu ti mangguyod ti grabidad ni Io, isu a basbassit ti adayo a maguyodmo:**  This is the opposite of what the passage says. The gravity on Io is *weaker*, not stronger.
* **D: Ad-adu koma ti mangguyod kenka ti grabidad ti lubong ngem ti grabidad ni Io:** This is the reverse of what the passage claims.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan iti makinruar a rabaw ti Bulan?","The correct answer is **B: Naingpis ti crust iti sirok dagiti nangato a daga.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ti sirok ti maria ken napuspuskol iti sirok ti nangato a daga."" This translates to ""The heights of the maria and are thickened on the heights of the highlands.""  This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti asideg a bangirna ket addaan iti napuspuskol a crust:** The passage states the crust is *thinner* on the near side and *thicker* on the far side.
* **C: Mabalin a basbassit ti maria iti adayo a bangir:** The passage states the maria are *thickened* on the far side.
* **D: Mabalin a basbassit ti maria iti sirok dagiti nangato a daga:** The passage says the maria are *thickened* in the highlands.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadino ti kapuskolan a paset ti crust ti Bulan?","The correct answer is **A: Iti asideg ti igidna**.

The text states: ""Agarup 70 km ti kapuskol ti crust iti asideg a bangirna..."" which translates to ""About 70 km is the thickness of the crust on the near side of the moon...""

Therefore, the crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side of the Moon (the side facing Earth). Option A accurately reflects this information.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti patien ti sumagmamano a tattao?","The correct answer is **C: Adda ti biag iti dadduma a planeta**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the possibility of humans traveling to other stars and the question of whether aliens exist. It highlights the vast distances between stars and the potential for life to have evolved elsewhere.  Option C directly reflects this central theme.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti tattao ket napan iti sabali a bituen:** The passage states this is *possible* but not currently achievable.
* **B: Saan a kabaelan dagiti tattao ti agsukisok iti dadduma a lubong:** The passage mentions the *potential* for exploration, despite the difficulties.
* **D: Adda nakurang a trilion a milia iti nagbaetan dagiti bituen:** This is a factual statement about the distance between stars, but it's not the main question being asked or the primary point of discussion regarding what people *believe*.



"
Ania ti agbalin a naingpis bayat nga ad-adda nga umakarka manipud iti tengnga ti Init?,"The correct answer is **C: Gas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uming-ingpis ti gas bayat nga umad-adayoka manipud iti sentro ti Init."" This directly translates to ""Gas is released outwards from the center of the Sun."" Therefore, gas is the substance that is expelled from the Sun's core.

While the Sun *contains* plasma and fire, the question asks specifically what is being released.  The passage clearly identifies it as gas.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a paset ti init ti makita manipud iti Lubong?","The correct answer is **C: Ti photosphere**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ti akinruar a parte a makitatayo no kumitatayo iti Init ket maawagan iti photosphere...""  This directly indicates the photosphere is the visible surface.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti crust:** The passage doesn't mention a ""crust"" in relation to the Sun.
* **B: Ti plasma:** Plasma is a component *of* the Sun, but not the surface we see.
* **D: Ti sentro:** The center of the Sun is not visible; the passage describes gas rising from the center.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a kapaliiwan ti nakatulong a mangpasingked iti teorya ni Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti paset iti Venus (The phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...idi 1610, iti Italiano nga astronomer a ni Galileo Galilei ket nagusar ti teleskopio tapno makitana nga adda paset iti Venus, a kas adda met iti bulan. Dagiti langlanga ti Venus ket suportaranna ti teoria ni Copernicus a dagiti planeta ket aglikaw iti Init.""  This directly links the phases of Venus to supporting Copernicus's heliocentric theory.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ti transit ti Venus (The transit of Venus):** While the transit of Venus is important in astronomical history, the passage mentions it only as a later event (1639) and doesn't connect it to supporting Copernicus's theory.
* **C: Dagiti panagpapada ti Init ken ti Venus (The orbits of the Sun and Venus):** This is too general. While the orbits are related, the specific *phases* of Venus were the key evidence Galileo observed.
* **D: Dagiti panagpapada ti Init ken Bulan (The orbits of the Sun and the Moon):** The comparison between the Moon and Venus, and the phases of Venus, is what was significant, not just the orbits themselves.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the passage."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti napaliiw ni Galileo Galilei idi 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti paset iti Venus**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Agarup tallo ribu a tawenen ti napalabas, idi 1610, iti Italiano nga astronomer a ni Galileo Galilei ket nagusar ti teleskopio tapno makitana nga adda paset iti Venus..."" (About three thousand years ago, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to find that there were phases of Venus...).
"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ti pagurnongan ti Karayan ti Amazon iti danum?","The correct answer is **A: Babbabassit a karayan (Smaller rivers)**.

The text states: ""Unongenna dagiti danum nga aggapu iti nadumaduma pay a babassit a karayan."" which translates to ""It collects water from various smaller rivers.""
"
Ania a pammadayaw ti saan a nainaig iti Karayan Amazon?,"The correct answer is **B: Dayta ti kadakkelan a karayan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti Amazon pay ti **maikadua a kadakkelan** a karayan iti Daga."" (The Amazon is also the **second largest** river in the Basin.)

Therefore, option B is incorrect. The other options are correct according to the text.
"
Ania a linia ti trabaho a nadakamat iti paset ti mangab-abang iti kabassitan a bilang dagiti taga-Venezuela?,"The correct answer is **D: Serbisio**.

The passage states: ""Dua a kakatlo kadagiti Venezuelan nga agob-obra ti adda iti sektor ti serbisio..."" which directly indicates that the service sector employs the largest portion of the Venezuelan workforce.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a sektor ti mangab-abang iti kaaduan a bilang dagiti taga-Venezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Serbisio**.

The text states: ""Dua a kakatlo kadagiti Venezuelan nga agob-obra ti adda iti sektor ti serbisio..."" which translates to ""Two-thirds of Venezuelan workers are in the service sector...""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti ipalubos ti fusion nga aramiden dagiti bituen?","The correct answer is **C: Mangiparuar iti lawag ken pudot**.

The passage states: ""Dagiti bituen ket mangted iti sillag ken pudot gapu iti enerhia a naaramid no dagiti hydrogen atomo ket agtipon (wenno agkaykaysada) nga agkadwa tapno makabuo iti nadagdagsen nga elemento.""  This translates to: ""Stars emit light and heat due to energy produced when hydrogen atoms combine (or fuse) to form heavier elements.""  So, the primary output of fusion in stars is light and heat (energy).
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti patauden ti makatulong a fusion reactor?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti atomo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that fusion occurs when hydrogen atoms combine.  The entire process hinges on the behavior of atoms, specifically hydrogen atoms, fusing together. While the other options are related to fusion, the *atoms* themselves are the fundamental components involved in the process.

* **A: Hydrogen** is a type of atom, but it's not the fundamental component the question is asking about.
* **B: Bitbituen (Stars)** are where fusion naturally occurs, but the question is about *building a reactor*.
* **D: Enerhia (Energy)** is the result of fusion, not a component *used to make* fusion happen.

Therefore, the most accurate and direct answer is **Dagiti atomo (Atoms)**."
Ania ti kemikal a pakabuklan ti danum?,"The correct answer is **D: Dua nga atomo ti hydrogen ken maysa nga atomo ti oxygen**.

The passage states: ""Ti compound a danum ket addaan iti dua nga atomo iti hidroheno ken maysa nga atomo iti oksiheno."" (The compound water has two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.)
"
"Inton agbaliw ti porma ti danum, ania ti agtalinaed a kas iti dati?","The correct answer is **A: Molekular nga istruktura**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti compound a danum ket addaan iti dua nga atomo iti hidroheno ken maysa nga atomo iti oksiheno. Addaan daytoy iti agpada a molekular nga istruktura no man pay daytoy ket maysa a gas, likido wenno solido.""

This directly means that regardless of whether water is a gas, liquid, or solid, its molecular structure (H₂O) remains the same. The physical state (gas, liquid, or solid) is a change in the arrangement and movement of the molecules, but the molecules themselves don't change.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kadagsen:** ""Kadagsen"" (meaning many) doesn't relate to the core identity of water.
*   **C: Pisikal a kasasaad:** The physical state *changes*, but the molecule doesn't. The question is what remains constant.
*   **D: Likido a nitrogen:** This is irrelevant to the properties of water. It's a different substance altogether.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a parikut iti sangapulo ket tallo nga estado idi padpadasenda nga ipabaklay ti sumagmamano a linteg?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa nga awan a nasional nga ehekutibo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""gapuna nga awan ti nasional nga ehekutibo wenno pangukuman..."" (because it lacked a national executive or judiciary...). This directly answers the question about what made it difficult for the states to enforce laws.
* Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:
    * **A: Nadagsen a panangimaton manipud kadagiti autoridad ti estado** While there was some resistance, the passage focuses on the *lack of power* within the central government, not necessarily resistance *from* the states.
    * **B: Awan ti bileg iti uneg ti Kongreso** The passage mentions the lack of power *of* the Congress, but the absence of a national executive/judiciary is a more fundamental issue hindering law enforcement.
    * **C: Dagiti enmienda a kasapulan ti agtutunos a pananganamong** The passage doesn't discuss the amendment process.



Therefore, the lack of a national executive is the key reason why the states found it difficult to enforce laws under the Articles of Confederation.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiyanninaw iti kasasaad ti gobierno sentral bayat ti Rebolusionario a Gubat?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti buis ket impatungpal ti Kongreso ken dagiti autoridad ti estado.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Turay ti Kongreso a mangipataw ti buwis...Awan met ti turayna a mangbaliw kadagiti linteg ti buis...""  This means the Congress *could* levy taxes, but states still had authority over taxes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti pannakabalbaliw dagiti Artikulo ket nagpannuray idi iti turay ti Kongreso:** The passage states the Articles *required unanimous consent* from all states to amend, highlighting the difficulty in changing the central government's structure. It doesn't say amendments *established* the Congress's power.
* **C: Awan ti presensia dagiti pannakabagi ti estado:** The passage emphasizes the *presence* of states, stating that the Articles required their unanimous consent for amendments.
* **D: Buklen ti gobierno sentral ti dua a kangrunaan a paset:** The passage indicates the central government was weak and lacked power, not composed of two primary branches.



"
Kasano a naisurat dagiti balikas iti likud ti Deklarasion ti Independensia?,"The correct answer is **C: Nabaliktad**.

The text states: ""Saan daytoy a mapa para iti gamgameng. Nakasurat idiay likod ti Deklarasion ti Pannakawaya ket dagiti sao a “Orihinal a Deklarasion ti Pannakawaya nga addaan petsa mika-4 iti Hulio 1776”. Iti surat ket agparang idiay baba ti dokumento, **nakabaliktad**.""
"
Agdindinamag ti Singapore gapu iti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **A: Berde ti siudad (Garden City)**.

The passage explicitly states that the Botanic Gardens in Singapore helped transform the island into a ""tropical Garden City."" The Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid being named the national flower further emphasizes Singapore's identity as a green and floral nation.
"
Ania ti Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa a sabong (a flower)**.

The passage states that Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid, was chosen as the national flower of Singapore. Therefore, it's a flower, or ""sabong"" in Filipino.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a kalidad dagiti piramid ti Giza ti saan la ketdi a pagsiddaawan dagiti Baro a Pagarian ti Ehipto?","The correct answer is **C: Ti kadakkelda (Their size)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""dagiti piramida iti Giza ket saanna naartapan ti kinadakkelna..."" which translates to ""the pyramids of Giza are unmatched in their size..."" This directly indicates that their size is a remarkable quality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti edadda (Their age):** While the pyramids are old, the passage mentions that the New Kingdom Egyptians built monuments to their predecessors, indicating the pyramids predate the New Kingdom. It doesn't say their age is unmatched.
* **B: Ti panagusar iti bato (Their use of stone):** The passage states that pyramids were built using stone, but it doesn't highlight this as an exceptional quality *beyond* the size and construction.
* **D: Ti pannakaaramidda (Their construction):**  The passage says the pyramids of Giza are unmatched in their *size*, implying the construction is also remarkable, but the question asks for something *unmatched*. The passage specifically points to the size as the unmatched quality.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ti pagdaliasatan dagiti agar-arab nga animal tapno surotenda dagiti tudo?","The correct answer is **C: Ti makin-abagatan a tanap**.

The text explicitly states that the animals migrate to the south for the rainy season.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a lugar ti pumanaw dagiti agar-arab nga animal no dadduma iti agarup Abril?","The correct answer is **B: Ti makin-abagatan a tanap** (The southern plains).

Here's why:

The passage states that the animals migrate from the northern part to the southern plains for the rainy season. It also mentions that they return to the north and then back to the southern plains after the rains. Therefore, the southern plains are where they go when they don't return to the north by April.
"
Ti Operation Sealion ket panangraut iti ania a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **B: Britania**.

The text states: ""nangrugin nga agsagana ti Alemania a mangraut iti **isla ti Britania**."" (Germany began to prepare to invade the **island of Britain**.)
"
Ania ti awag ti Germany iti panangraut iti Britania?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Inikkan ti Germany iti code name ti panagatake nga “Operation Sealion”."" (Germany gave the invasion attack its code name ""Operation Sealion"".)
"
Ania ti saan a nadakamat kas kasapulan nga addang iti plano ti Italia a mangtiliw kadagiti pagilian ti Africa?,"The correct answer is **C: Panangipasdek iti troop launching pad**.

Here's why:

The text states that Italy needed to secure bases in Egypt to launch their troops into Africa. It also mentions they were having trouble building new ships. However, it **doesn't mention anything about establishing troop launching pads**. Therefore, that's the element missing from their plan that the text highlights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panangikkat kadagiti barko idiay Ehipto** - The text explicitly states they *needed* to secure bases in Egypt, implying they were trying to establish a presence there, including potentially utilizing existing naval assets.
*   **B: Panagaramid kadagiti kanayonan a barko** - The text says they were building only four new ships, indicating this was a problem they were facing.
*   **D: Panangdadael kadagiti base ti Britania** - While Italy might have wanted to weaken British bases, the text doesn't focus on this as a *lack* in their plan. Their primary obstacle seems to be logistical (ships and bases in Egypt).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti naibilang a kangrunaan a panggep ti Italia iti gubat?","The correct answer is **A: Kemmegen dagiti pagilian iti Africa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti kangrunaan a kayat ti Italia ket dagiti pagilian idiay Africa. Tapno makemmeg dagitoy a pagilian, masapulda ti pangipatayaban ti buyotda..."" (The main desire of Italy is the countries in Africa. To conquer these countries, they need to deploy their fleet...).

While options B, C, and D are related to Italy's actions, they are *means* to achieve the main goal of conquering African territories. The primary objective is Africa itself.
"
Asinno ti nangipasdek iti nainggayyeman a relasion kadagiti manangraut?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti German**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Allied forces liberated southern France. The question asks who *maintained tense relations* during the liberation. The passage implies tension because the liberation happened *despite* the existence of the Vichy regime and the overall war against Germany. Therefore, the German presence and control over France were the source of the tense relations. 

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti Pranses a Vichy:** The Vichy regime was collaborating with the Germans, not maintaining tense relations *with* the liberating forces. They were aligned with the enemy.
* **C: Dagiti Amerikano:** The Americans were the ones conducting the liberation; they wouldn't be the cause of tense relations *during* the liberation.
* **D: Dagiti Pranses a Nawaya:** The ""Free French"" were fighting alongside the Allies, not maintaining tense relations.

Therefore, the German occupation and control were the primary factor leading to tense relations during the liberation of France.
"
Asinno dagiti Aliado a nairaman iti Operation Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti Amerikano ken Free French**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Iti uneg ti dua a lawas laeng, pinaruk-atan dagiti Amerikano ken dagiiti puersa ti Free French ti abagatan ti France ket agturongdan iti Germany."" This translates to ""In the core of just two phases, the Americans and the Free French forces invaded southern France to advance towards Germany.""
"
Ti itatanor ti ania a teknolohia ti nakaigapuan ti panangrugi dagiti submarino nga agbiahe iti sirok ti danum?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

Here's why:

The passage states that with the invention of radar, it became harder for submarines to operate undetected. This implies that radar was the technology that hindered their ability to travel deep underwater.  The passage doesn't mention U-Boats, range, or sailing as the technology that enabled deep underwater travel; rather, it states they were *limited* by the development of radar.
"
"Bayat ti damo a pannakausar dagitoy, limitado unay ti sakup dagiti submarino iti ania a lugar?","The correct answer is **B: Panagbiahe (Voyaging)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Dagiti submarino ket barkona naidisenyo nga agbiahe iti uneg iti baybay..."" This directly translates to ""Submarines are ships designed to voyage underwater..."" Therefore, the primary function and initial limitation of submarines was their ability to voyage underwater. While they could be used for other purposes (like fighting), the text emphasizes their capacity for underwater travel as a defining characteristic."
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno iti nagsalungasing iti paglintegan iti ili? ","The correct answer is **D: Iti Soviets**.

The passage states that after the Soviet Union violated numerous international treaties (Riga Peace Treaty, Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and others) and invaded the northern regions of Poland, 800,000 Soviet soldiers advanced into the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts. This indicates the Soviets were the aggressors and therefore the ones who initiated the conflict and violated the existing agreements.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad iti haan a maisaysayangkay ti Nalabbaga nga Army?,"The correct answer is **B: Iti panagdarup ti akindaya a dagdaga (In the occupation of the northern territories)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Soviet Union violated multiple international treaties (Riga Peace Treaty, Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral agreements) by invading Poland.
* The passage specifically mentions the Soviet Union's invasion of the northern regions of Poland.
* Option B directly reflects this violation of international agreements by describing the Soviet Union's ""occupation of the northern territories.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti panagparsua iti buyot ti Ukranian (In the occupation of Ukrainian territory):** While the Soviet Union did occupy Ukrainian territory, the passage doesn't highlight this as a specific action that was *not* intended.
* **C: Iti panagplastar idiay bridgehead (In the plastering of the bridgehead):** The passage mentions the Soviet Union's attempt to establish a bridgehead, but doesn't frame this as a failed or unintended action.
* **D: Iti panagsalungasing ti katulagan (In the violation of treaties):** This is too general. The question asks what the Soviet Union *didn't intend* to do, and the passage focuses on their *actions* (the invasion and occupation) that violated treaties.



"
Ania ti napasamak ti Panguluen nga Inhinyehro iti Maikasangapulo nga Army iti Italia?,"The correct answer is **C: Nakemmeg isuna iti Briton**.

The passage states: ""Iti maysa a pagtambang idiay daya iti Bardia, natiliw dagiti Briton iti Panguluen nga Inhinyero iti Maikasangapulo a Buyot iti Italia, ni Heneral Lastucci."" This translates to: ""In a battle east of Bardia, the British captured the Chief Engineer of the Tenth Army in Italy, General Lastucci.""
"
Sadinno iti nakapatayan ni Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Hunio 28, ni Marshal Italo Balbo, Gobernador-Heneral ti Libya ken agtawid kenni Mussolini, ket napapatay ti mannakigayyem nga apoy bayat nga agdisdisso idiay **Tobruk**."" (June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and crossing to Mussolini, was killed by machine gun fire while dismounting in **Tobruk**.)
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a panagpanpanunot iti imporatante a paset ti Tibetan a meditasion?","The correct answer is **C: Panangiladawan kadagiti didiosen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Babaen iti bisualisasion ti nadumaduma a dios, madalusan dagiti pagdalanan ti enerhia, maparuk-atan dagiti dagiti chakra, ken maparnuay ti pannakalawlawag ti nakem."" This directly links visualizing deities with a key aspect of Tibetan meditation.

While options A, B, and D are mentioned as techniques *within* Kundalini Yoga, the text specifically highlights visualization of deities as central to the *Tibetan* meditation practice described.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano a mapaaktibo dagiti chakra bayat ti “sentro” ti meditasion ti Tibet?","The correct answer is **B: Babaen ti panangiladawan kadagiti didiosen**.

The text states: ""Babaen iti bisualisasion ti nadumaduma a dios, madalusan dagiti pagdalanan ti enerhia, maparuk-atan dagiti dagiti chakra, ken maparnuay ti pannakalawlawag ti nakem."" This directly links visualizing deities (didiosen) with activating the chakras.

While the other options (posture, mantras, and breathing exercises) are all part of Kundalini Yoga and can influence the chakras, the passage specifically mentions visualization of deities as a key method for directly affecting the chakras within the Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice.
"
Asinno iti nangidaulo ti maikadua a kanta para kadagiti deboto kabayatan iti programa?,"The correct answer is **C: Raju Khandelwal**.

The text states: ""Kalpasanna, sinublat ni Lakkha Singh ti panangidaulo iti panagkanta iti bhajans. Dinanggayan isuna ti kumakanta a **ni Raju Khandelwal**."" This translates to: ""Afterward, Lakkha Singh resumed leading the singing of bhajans. He was joined by **Raju Khandelwal**.""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno iti nangidaulo ti maikadua a kanta para kadagiti deboto kabayatan iti panangited ti kanen?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Kalpasanna, sinublat ni Lakkha Singh ti panangidaulo iti panagkanta iti bhajans."" This translates to ""Afterwards, Lakkha Singh took over leading the singing of bhajans.""  It also mentions he led the singing *after* the Chhappan Bhog was served.
"
Ania iti maikadua iti maudi a pabuya iti rabii?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina ken Haris Alexiou**.

The question asks for the second to last performance of the evening. The passage states that Sezen Aksu performed alongside Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou. The ""Troy"" performance was the last one. Therefore, Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou were the second to last.
"
Ania iti pannakipagili ni Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Italiano**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti Turkish a diva a ni Sezen Aksu ket nagpabuya a kaduana ti tenor nga Italiano a ni Alesssandro Safina..."" which translates to ""The Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed alongside the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina...""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng iti haan a pudno?","The correct answer is **D: Nagpaut iti kababaan ti 60 a minutos tapno maikkat ti immuna a tao iti pagluganan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ti simple a pagsasao, ket inabot ti kababaan a maysa oras tapno maikkat ti immuna a tao iti pagluganan."" (the simple solution was to reduce the wait time by an hour to get the first person on the ride.)
* **Option D accurately reflects this statement.** It correctly identifies the action taken – reducing the wait time by 60 minutes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adda napuoran idiay Santa Clara:** While true (it happened in Santa Clara), it doesn't represent a *negative* consequence or something that should have been avoided.
* **B: Naipit dagitay tattao idiay roller coaster:** This describes the situation, not a consequence or something to avoid.
* **C: Naikkan ti danum dagiti pasahero:** This is a solution to the problem, not something that should have been avoided. It's what was *done* to help the passengers.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno iti nangdillaw iti haan a nanam-ay a pudot?","The correct answer is **B: Iti kapitan ti puor (Fire Captain)**.

The passage states: ""Imbaga ni Scout Kouns a kapitan a bombero a..."" which directly indicates that the fire captain, Scout Kouns, made the statement about the roller coaster ride being uncomfortable in the heat.
"
Sadinno a luglugar iti naawanan ti kuriente gapu iti napasamak a tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""Awan iti dakkel a dadael wenno dagiti nadangran a naipadamag idiay Tonga, ngem temporario a nagpukaw ti elektrisidad..."" which translates to ""There was no major damage or reported casualties in Tonga, but it temporarily caused a power outage...""

While Hawaii had road closures, the power outage is specifically mentioned in Tonga. Niue and Pago Pago are mentioned as locations where tsunamis have occurred but not as locations experiencing a power outage due to the recent event.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano a naapektaran iti pagilian ti Tonga iti panagawan ti kuriente?","The correct answer is **A: Adda sagmamano a dadael iti naipadamag (There was some power outage)**.

The text states: ""ngem temporario a nagpukaw ti elektrisidad, a naipadamag a nanglapped kadagiti autoridad ti Tonga..."" which translates to ""but temporarily triggered electricity, which was shut down, hindering the Tongan authorities from receiving tsunami alerts from the PTWC.""  This indicates that power *was* affected, even if temporarily.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Awan naawat ti autoridad a damag maipanggep kadagiti naikkat a pakdaar (The authorities did not receive any alerts regarding the recent data)** - The text says they *did* receive alerts, but were hindered in acting on them.
* **C: Ti basa iti pantar ti baybay ket naapektaran (The coastal waters were affected)** - While the tsunami *caused* the coastal waters to be affected, the question specifically asks about the impact on the *power*.
* **D: Dagiti autoridad ket haan a nakaawat iti napnuan ti pateg a pakdaar (The authorities should not have received complete alerts)** - The text doesn't suggest they shouldn't have received alerts; it suggests the alerts hampered their response.



"
Sadinno nausar iti pulis dagitay paltog a radar da tapno maorasan iti kinapaspas ti panagmaneho ni Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **C: Kanito iti panagmaneho na ti nasurok 160 km/h**.

The passage states: ""Naiturong ni Mr Reid ti kotse ti New Zealand nga A1GP, a Black Beauty ti kapaspas a sumurok 160km/h a maminpito iti rangtay. Iti polis ti New Zealand ket addaan ti yengyengna ti panagusarda ti paltog a speed radar tapno makita no kasano ti kinapartak ni Mr Reid gapu ta kasta kababa ti Black Beauty, ken ti kanito a naorasan ti pulis ni Mr Reid ket idi bimmuntog isuna ti 160km/h.""

This clearly indicates the police used their speed radar when Jonny Reid was driving at approximately 160 km/h. Option C accurately reflects this.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, apay a narigatan ti pulis iti New Zealand nga orasan ti kinapartak ni Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: Agmanmaneho isuna iti paspas ti 160 km/h**.

The text explicitly states that the police used a speed radar because Mr. Reid was driving the ""Black Beauty"" A1GP car at a speed of approximately 160km/h.
"
Sadinno ti nakaisentroan ti gingined a mainaig iti Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 milia iti abagatan**.

The text states: ""Ti sentro ti ginggined ket adda iti agarup 65 km (40 milia) iti abagatan ti Butte."" This means the epicenter was approximately 40 miles south of Butte.
"
Ania ti napasamak bayat ti riribuk idiay Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Panangabuso kadagiti balud**.

The passage states that the Abu Ghraib prison riot happened ""bayat ti maysa a panagriribuk"" (during a riot) and that the prison was stormed ""kalpayatan ti nadiskobre sadiay ti pannakaabuso dagiti preso"" (after the discovery of prisoner abuse). The question asks what happened *during* the riot, and the passage directly links the riot to the discovery of prisoner abuse.
"
Apay a nakagun-od ti panagdindinnamag ti pagbaludan ti Iraq? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ti pannakatakuat iti panangabuso kadagiti balud (Fear of abuse of prisoners)**.

Here's why:

The question asks *why* the Abu Ghraib prison riot occurred. The prompt states that the riot happened *after* the discovery of prisoner abuse by US forces. This discovery led to fear and outrage, ultimately triggering the riot.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pinuoran daytoy (It was looted)** While looting may have occurred *during* the riot, it wasn't the primary *cause* of the riot.
*   **B: Kontrolado dagiti puersa ti US (US forces controlled it)** The riot indicates a *loss* of control by US forces, not a state of control.
*   **C: Nagadu ti riribuk (There were many riots)** The question refers to *the* Abu Ghraib riot, not general riots.



"
Ania a kita ti pasken ti maangay iti War Memorial Stadium ti Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Konsierto**.

The question states the War Memorial Stadium in Maui is where the band *was scheduled* to perform, and the cancellation was due to logistical challenges. Bands perform concerts at stadiums. The other options are less likely:

*   **A: Magic show:** While possible, it's not the primary use of a large stadium like this.
*   **B: Ay-ayam ti football:**  While stadiums *can* host football, the text focuses on a *band* and a large audience, suggesting a concert.
*   **D: Panagurnong iti pondo:**  While events can raise money, the context points to a regular event like a concert.



"
Asinno ti nangipaay kamaudiananna iti panangilawlawag maipapan iti pannakakansela ti pasamak?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti kompania a mangimatmaton (HK Management Inc)**.

The text states that HK Management Inc. (the company managing the band) ""pinabasolda dagiti rason a lohistikal kinabigatanna"" (explained logistical difficulties as the reason for cancellation). Therefore, they are the ones providing the explanation.
"
Asinno ti impagarup ti sumagmamano nga umili ti Bishkek a makaigapu iti pannakasamsam?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti pannakabagi ti linteg (Traffic laws)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Naireport a nagtultuloy iti agpatnag ti nasaknap a panagtakaw, kabayatan ti kaawan dagiti pannakabagi ti liteg kadagiti kalsada ti Bishkek."" (It is reported that the situation of reckless driving continues due to the lack of adherence to traffic laws in Bishkek.)
* **The context:** The entire paragraph describes problems arising from a lack of respect for traffic laws in Bishkek, leading to chaos and reckless driving.
* **Option A directly addresses the root of the problem:** Lack of adherence to traffic laws is the reason for the reckless driving and the resulting issues.

The other options are not directly supported by the text:

* **B: Dagiti makinkukua iti tiendaan (Shopkeepers):** While shopkeepers might be affected by the chaos, the passage doesn't say they are the solution to the problem.
* **C: Dagiti agprotprotesta (Protesters):** The passage mentions protesters but doesn't suggest they are a way to solve the traffic problems.
* **D: Dagiti tin-edyer (Teenagers):**  The passage doesn't focus on teenagers as a solution to the traffic issues.



"
Asinno ti nangpabasol kadagiti agprotprotesta manipud iti abagatan gapu iti panagsamsam?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti umili ti Bishkek (Residents of Bishkek)**.

The text states: ""Sumagmamano a residente iti Bishnek dagiti nagprotesta..."" which translates to ""Some residents of Bishkek protested...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti pannakabagi ti linteg (Traffic authorities):** The text mentions traffic issues, but doesn't state the traffic authorities were protesting.
* **C: Dagiti anarkista (Anarchists):** The text describes Bishkek as an ""anarchic"" state, but doesn't explicitly say the protesters were anarchists.
* **D: Gang ti tattao (People's gangs):** While the text mentions ""gangs of people,"" it doesn't identify them as the protesters.
"
Kaano a napadasan ti Ring ti immadu a naglakuan?,"The correct answer is **A: Kalpasan ti panagparangna iti Shark Tank**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nagaramid isuna ti WiFi a doorbell, kinunana. Kinuna ni Siminoff nga iti naglakwanda ket pimmigsa kalpasan ti panagparangna idi 2013 idiay pabuya a Tangke ti Pating no sadinno a dagiti hurado ti pabuya ket saanda pinondoan ti negosio. **Kalpasan ti panagparangna iti Shark Tank** a nagaramid isuna ti naglakwanda.""

While the other options are related to Ring's history, the passage directly links the significant increase in Ring's success to appearing on Shark Tank.
"
Kaano nga inkeddeng ni Jamie Siminoff a rugian ti Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Kalpasan a nabigbigna a saan nga umdas ti bukodna a doorbell.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Iti napalabas, imbaga ti CEO ti Ring, a ni Jamie Siminoff, a nangrugi ti kompania idi saan a mangngeg ti doorbellna idiay garahena."" (In the report, Ring CEO Jamie Siminoff said he started the company after not hearing his doorbell at his garage.)
"
Tunggal Reading Rainbow episode ket nangitukon kadagiti rekomendasion dagiti ubbing para iti ania?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti libro**.

The passage states: ""Kada pabuya ket mangted met iti rekomendasion no ania dagiti libro a masapul a biroken dagiti ubbing no mapanda iti libraria."" (Each episode also provides recommendations for books that children can read if they are interested in the library.)
"
Ania ti mabalin a nakatulong iti pannakakansela ti serye ti Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **A: Awan ti umdas a pondo (Lack of funding)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mamati ti dadduma, agraman ni John Grant, nga iti krisis ti panagpundo ken panagbaliw ti pilosopia ti panagprograma kadagiti pang-edukasion a telebision ket isu iti nakaigapuan ti panangisardengda kadagiti pabuya."" (According to others, John Grant, said that the crisis of funding and the change in philosophy of educational television programming were the reasons for the cancellation of the shows.) While the other options are mentioned, the lack of funding is presented as the primary reason. The passage directly links the funding crisis to the cancellation.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Awan ti Emmy awards (Lack of Emmy awards):** The passage states Reading Rainbow *did* win Emmy awards.
*   **C: Ti opinion ni John Grant (John Grant's opinion):** John Grant is *sharing his opinion* about the reasons for cancellation, not *being* the reason for cancellation.
*   **D: Ti balligi ti Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood (The popularity of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood):** While Mister Rogers' Neighborhood is mentioned as a benchmark, the passage doesn't suggest its popularity *caused* Reading Rainbow's cancellation. It's more of a comparison.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga argumento nga inaramid dagiti opisial para iti Amsterdam ken ti museo maipapan iti kayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Di maliklikan a matnag dayta (It cannot be treated)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the officials were concerned about the tree being a danger to the public and facing the risk of it collapsing.  It also mentions the tree being inspected for rot. Options B, C, and D all represent potential reasons for concern and actions officials might take (e.g., if it's rotten, it could be unstable; fungus indicates disease; danger to public is a primary concern).  

However, if the officials argued the tree *could not be treated*, that would be a reason *to* take action (removal, etc.). The passage doesn't state that the tree cannot be treated; it only mentions the *risk* of it falling and being a danger. Therefore, the statement that it ""cannot be treated"" is the least likely argument they would present.
"
"Segun iti maysa a chief inspector para iti RSPCA, dagiti inspeksion ket rumbeng a kadawyan para iti ania kadagiti sumaganad?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti abattoir (Abattoirs)**.

The text states that the chief inspector believes CCTV surveillance is important for the ""inspection and inspection of abattoirs."" While the text mentions animals and workers, the emphasis is on the inspection of abattoirs as a primary reason for the CCTV.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti makatulong a mangpatibker iti kinapateg ti pagimbagan ti kinakaradkad dagiti animal kadagiti trabahador iti abattoir nga Australiano?","The correct answer is **A: Ti pannakaikabil dagiti CCTV kamera**.

The passage explicitly states that Animal Liberation is calling for CCTV cameras to be installed in all parts of abattoirs in Australia.  The RSPCA inspector also states that CCTV cameras are necessary for monitoring and inspecting abattoirs to ensure animal welfare. Therefore, installing CCTV cameras is presented as the solution to helping prevent the mistreatment of animals.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti trabaho ti tao a naaresto?","The correct answer is **A: Estudiante (Student)**.

The text states: ""maysa nga estudyante pay ti naaresto mainaig ti panagpaltog idiay eskuela..."" which translates to ""one student was also arrested in connection with the school shooting...""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, bayat nga agsaksaknap ti damag maipapan iti sabali pay a pannakaaresto, maar-aramid dagiti pumpon para ti mano a biktima?","The correct answer is **A: Maysa**.

The text states: ""maysa nga estudyante pay ti naaresto mainaig ti panagpaltog idiay eskuela..."" which translates to ""one student was arrested in connection with the school shooting...""  This indicates only one arrest was made.
"
"Kas sungbat kadagiti protesta, ania a pagilian ti saan a nagturong iti pinirmaan ti katulaganda iti ACTA?","The correct answer is **A: Germany**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that protests occurred in Germany (Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, Hanover).
* It also states that Poland *did* sign ACTA (though the government hadn't yet ratified it at the time).
* The passage mentions protests in Lithuania, Latvia, and Slovakia *against* ACTA.
* The passage mentions protests in Scotland, but it doesn't explicitly state whether Scotland signed ACTA or not.

Therefore, Germany is the only country listed that is explicitly mentioned as being the location of protests, and is not mentioned as being a signer of ACTA."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a pagilian ti nangikeddeng a mangitantan iti proseso ti pannakikadua iti ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The text states: ""Iti Latvia ken Slovakia ket agpada a naudi iti prosesona a pannakikuyog iti ACTA."" (In Latvia and Slovakia, the process of opposition to ACTA was similar.) This indicates that Latvia was one of the countries opposing ACTA. While Lithuania is mentioned as having protests, it doesn't explicitly state opposition to ACTA in the same way as Latvia and Slovakia.  Estonia and Scotland are not mentioned in connection to opposing ACTA.
"
Mano a tattao ti nasugatan gapu kadagiti insidente ti panagbara ti iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states: ""panagsagaba iti uppat a tao iti pannakasinit"" which translates to ""resulting in the injury of four people"". Therefore, four people were injured.
"
Asinno ti nagkuna a saan unay a nakaro dagiti insidente ti panagpudot?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The text states: ""Inwaragawag ti METI a pinakaammuan ida ti Apple iti 34 a nainayon nga insidente ti nalabes a panagbara, nga imbilang ti kompania a “saan a serioso.”"" This directly quotes the METI saying that Apple considered the incidents ""not serious."" Therefore, Apple is the one who downplayed the severity of the incidents.
"
"Bayat ti panagbitlana, ania ti imbaga ni Steve Jobs nga imbento manen ti Apple?","The correct answer is **A: Pakasaritaan (History)**.

The passage states Steve Jobs said, ""It's Apple that's going to turn the phone on its head, we're going to make history."" He didn't invent a specific product, but rather promised to make a historical impact with Apple's new phone. Therefore, ""history"" is the best answer.
"
Ania ti panggep ti dua nga oras a palawag ni Steve Jobs?,"The correct answer is **C: Tapno mairuar ti baro a phone**.

Here's why:

* The prompt specifically states that Steve Jobs is known for successfully launching the iPhone. 
* The quote ""Ita ti Apple ket mangbaliw iti telepono, mangaramid kami ti pakasaritaan a pasamak ita"" strongly suggests he's announcing a significant advancement in phone technology.

The other options are less likely based on the context:

* **A: Tapno mairugi ti baro a tablet:** While Apple has tablets, the focus is on the phone in the prompt.
* **B: Tapno mairugi ti baro a kompiuter:**  Again, while Apple makes computers, the prompt's emphasis is on the phone.
* **D: Tapno ipakaammona ti panagretirona:**  The prompt focuses on the excitement of a new product launch, not his retirement.



"
Ania ti inwaragawag ni Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner iti Teatro ti Argentina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti kandidaturana kas presidente**.

The passage states: ""Ti agdama a senador ken First Lady ti Argentina a ni Cristina Fernandez de Kircher inyanunsiona idi kalman iti rabii ti panagkandidatona kas presidente..."" which translates to ""The current senator and First Lady of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced in the late evening her candidacy for president...""
"
Sadinno ti nangipakaammoan ni Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner iti panggepna nga agkandidato?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti maysa a teatro a 31 a milia ti kaadayona manipud La Plata**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...inyanunsiona idi kalman iti rabii ti panagkandidatona kas presidente idiay La Plata, maysa nga ili a 50 a kilometro (31 milia) manipud Buenos Aires.""
* It further states: ""Impakaammo ni Mrs. Kircher ti intensionna a tumaray para ti pagkapresidente idiay Argentene Theathre, iti pareho nga lokasion nga inusarna idi rugianna iti kampanyana idi 2005 para iti Senado kas miembro iti delegasion ti probinsia iti Buenos Aires."" 
* Therefore, the announcement was made in a theater located 31 miles from La Plata. Option A accurately reflects this information."
Ania dagiti natakuatan ti ACMA maipapan ken ni Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **C: Nalabsing dagiti linteg ti panangsensor (Concerned about censorship regulations)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Naipabpabuya ti video iti internet, saan a linabsing ti Big Brother dagiti linteg iti online content censorhip gapu ta saan a naikabil ti media iti website ti Big Brother."" This means the ACMA is concerned about the potential for censorship related to the Big Brother website.
* **Option A** is incorrect because the passage says the regulations haven't *been* issued, implying concern *about* them, not that they've been issued and are no longer a worry.
* **Option B** is not directly supported. While the passage mentions the media isn't integrated into the Big Brother website, this isn't the primary concern.
* **Option D** is incorrect. The passage focuses on regulations and online content, not the physical server.

Therefore, the ACMA is primarily concerned about the implications of online content censorship regulations related to the Big Brother website."
Ania dagiti parametro a masapul a mairaman ti media tapno maibilang a linaon ti internet?,"The correct answer is **A: Masapul a mai-stream dayta iti internet.**

Here's why:

The question is about what makes online content *covered* by the ACMA's regulations. The context of the question and the provided text highlights that the ACMA's jurisdiction extends to content that is *streamed* online, even if it originates from a server. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Masapul a pisikal nga agnanaed dayta iti server:** While the content might be *on* a server, the regulation isn't tied to its physical location.  The regulation is about content *available* online.
* **C: Saan a maidulin dayta iti website:**  This is irrelevant.  Content on a website could be regulated if it's being streamed or otherwise made available to the public.
* **D: Masapul nga aprobaran ti ACMA:**  The text implies that *any* content streamed online is subject to the Act, not just content that is pre-approved. The text mentions the Big Brother example, which is streamed content.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that content must be **streamed** online to fall under the ACMA's purview.
"
Asinno ti lider ti Liberal a Partido ti Australia?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The passage states that Peter Costello ""nalabit a sumukat ken Prime Minister John Howard kas lider ti grupo Liberal."" This means John Howard was the leader.
"
Apay a saan pay nga addaan ti Australia iti industria ti nuclear a bileg?,"The best answer is **B: Kontrobersial unay (Highly controversial)**.

Here's why:

The provided text highlights that Peter Costello, a prominent figure, *supports* nuclear power. However, the question asks why Australia *doesn't have* a nuclear power industry. The text implies there are obstacles preventing its development. Costello's statement about not being principled in opposing nuclear energy suggests that opposition exists. While the text doesn't explicitly state the reasons for lack of development, the implication is that it's not a simple matter and there's resistance, making it ""highly controversial.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Awan ti suporta ti publiko (Lack of public support):** The text doesn't mention public opinion. Costello's support itself contradicts this.
*   **C: Napeggad unay (Too expensive):** The text doesn't provide information about cost.
*   **D: Nangina unay (Too dangerous):** While safety concerns are often associated with nuclear power, the text doesn't explicitly mention danger as a reason for the lack of development.

Therefore, **B** is the most reasonable inference based on the information given."
Asinno nga agis-ski ti nakisali babaen ti tulong ti maysa a giya?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel** and **D: Anna Ogarzynka**.

The text states: ""Ni Adam Hall ti New Zealand, nagleppas a maikasiam iti para lallaki nga standing Super-G. **Ni umi-ski a lalaki ti Poland nga addaan problema ti panagkitana a ni Maciej Krezel ken ti giyana a ni Anna Ogarzynka ket nakalpasda kas maikasangapulo-ket-tallo iti Super-G.**""

This clearly indicates that Maciej Krezel and Anna Ogarzynka skied with the help of a guide.



"
Ania a pagilian ti nagturpos a maikasangapulo iti standing class ti babbai iti Super-G?,"The correct answer is **B: Netherlands**.

The text states: ""Karaman ti Netherlands, nga inrepresentar ni Anna Jochemsen a nakaala iti maika-siam a puesto iti standing class ti babbai iti Super-G idi kalman..."" 
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng maipapan ken ni Blake ti saan a nakanatad?","The correct answer is **C: Nagusar iti poste bayat ti panangraut.**

The passage states: ""Iti tagaprisinta, a naaresto idiay eksena, ket ilibakna ti atake ken ibagana nga inusarna ti poste tapno salaknibanna ti bagbagina kadagiti bote nga imbato kaniana iti agarup tallo pulo a tattao.""

This directly indicates that Blake is accused of using a pole during the assault. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Natiliw daytoy iti lugar:** While the passage mentions an incident, it doesn't state that the place was damaged.
* **B: Inaminna ti panangraut:** The passage says Blake *denied* the assault.
* **D: Kinunana a naibelleng kenkuana dagiti botelia:** The passage focuses on the pole, not the bottles.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a napasamak ken ni Blake?","The correct answer is **D: Naibaga kenkuana a dakkel ti gasat a maibalud isuna (It was told to him that he might not be able to be punished).**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Imbaga ti ukom ken ni Blake a “mabalin a saannan a maliklikan” ti pannakaibaludna."" This translates to ""The court told Blake that he might not be able to be punished.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naduktalan a nakabasol gapu iti panangballikug iti hustisia (He was found guilty of obstructing justice):** The text mentions he's accused of an attack, but doesn't state a verdict of obstructing justice.
* **B: Natiliw isuna (He was injured):** The text mentions he used a pole to defend himself, but doesn't say he was injured.
* **C: Naraut babaen ti poste (He was hurt by the pole):**  The text says he *used* the pole, not that he was hurt by it.



"
Ania ti saan a pakausaran ti pondo ti U.N. iti panagbara ti lubong?,"The correct answer is **B: Panangiyeg iti teknolohia kadagiti agdurdur-as a nasion**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the UN fund will be used to help vulnerable nations adapt to the effects of climate change by investing in things like:

*   **Di malayus a balbalay** (climate-resilient housing)
*   **Nasaysayaat a pannakamanehar ti danum** (improved water management)
*   **Pannakapayad-adu ti mulmula** (increased crop yields)

It also mentions using technology to help vulnerable nations, but the question asks what is **not** used. The passage says the fund aims to leverage technology, but doesn't specify that the core use of the fund *is* technology investment in vulnerable nations.  The focus is more on the *application* of technology to help with adaptation.

The other options *are* explicitly mentioned as areas where the funds will be used. Therefore, B is the correct answer.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti namnamaen nga isalakan ti U.N.?","The correct answer is **A: Kuarta, babaen ti panagbibinninglay iti teknolohia**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Namnamaen met ti U. N. a mairingpas ti pondo a mangtulong kadagiti pagilian a naapektaran ti panagbara ti lubong..."" (The U.N. also hopes to raise funds to help countries affected by climate change...)
* ... ""...tapno mabaeladan a sarangten dagiti epekto Mabalin a maigato ti kuarta iti di malayus a balbalay, nasaysayaat a pannakamanehar ti danum, ken pannakapayad-adu ti mulmula."" (...to be able to mitigate the effects. Funds can be allocated to affordable housing, improved water management, and increased afforestation.)

While the passage mentions various areas where funds *can* be allocated, the primary thing the U.N. hopes to raise is **funds** (kuarta) through the application of **technology** (panagbibinninglay iti teknolohia). Option A captures this essence best.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a dinakamat ni Albert Muchanga kas banag a kasapulan pay laeng a mapagnunumuan?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti konsesion ti taripa (Tariff concessions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saan kami pay a nagtulag maipapan kadagiti linteg iti kalintegan maipapan iti naggapuan **ken taripa**..."" This directly indicates that tariff concessions are something that still needs to be agreed upon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: No makikadua koma ni Benin iti AfCTA (If Benin is willing to join AfCFTA):** The passage implies Benin *is* participating (they are joining the summit and Muchanga is speaking with them).
* **B: Ti petsa a mabalin a mangrugi ti panagtagilako (The date when trade can begin):** Muchanga states they are aiming for July 1, 2020, so this *is* mentioned.
* **C: Dagiti alagaden ti naggapuan (The outstanding issues):** While mentioned, the specific outstanding issue highlighted is tariff concessions.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, apay a mabalin a mangrugi ti panagtagilako iti Hulio?","The correct answer is **B: Adda umdas a balangkas dagiti alagaden ken konsesion a naikabil.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saan kami pay a nagtulag maipapan kadagiti linteg iti kalintegan maipapan iti naggapuan ken taripa, ngem ti modelo nga addaan kami ket umanay tapno marugian ti panagkalakal intono Hulyo 1, 2020."" This implies that a framework of agreements and concessions *has been established* which allows for the launch date.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti petsa ti panangrugi iti Hulio ket paset ti termino ti Nigeria para iti pannakikadua iti AfCFTA:** While Nigeria's involvement is relevant, the passage doesn't directly link the July launch date *solely* to Nigeria's term.
* **C: Okay dayta ti komisioner ti komersio ken industria ti AU:**  The commissioner's statement indicates a *potential* launch, not a definitive approval.
* **D: Napagnunumuan dagiti pagannurotan ti nagtaudan ken konsesion ti taripa:** The passage explicitly says they *haven't* finalized the economic regulations and tariff concessions.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti inakusaran ti Atlanta Journal-Constitution kadagiti opisial ti edukasion?","The correct answer is **C: Saan nga agtignay kadagiti naduktalan a parikut iti uneg (Failed to act on known problems)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ipakita kalpasanna ti ebidensia a nabiangan dagiti test paper. Nasentensiaan ni Hall, a kaduana ti 34 a dadduma pay nga opisial ti edukasion, idi 2013.""  It also mentions that the school system *knew* about problems with the test results but didn't take action. This directly supports the idea that the officials failed to address known issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panangbalbaliw iti report ti Journal-Constitution (Manipulating the Journal-Constitution's report):** The text doesn't say the officials manipulated the report. It says the *report* revealed problems.
* **B: Ti pannakapaay a mangpabaro iti edukasion iti siudad (Attempting to reform education in the city):**  The text highlights a failure in reform, not an attempt at it.
* **D: Panangireport kadagiti nababa nga iskor iti eksamen (Reporting low test scores):** The Journal-Constitution *reported* low scores; the accusation was about what the officials *did* with that information.



"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, ania ti saan a nadakamat iti report ti Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **B: Ebidensia a nabalbaliwan dagiti papel ti eksamen**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the report *showed* a decline in test scores and that there was later *evidence* of altered test papers. The report itself didn't show the evidence of altered papers; it highlighted the declining scores.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naisangsangayan a panagpasayaat ti marka ti eksamen:** The passage explicitly says schools *did* experience significant gains in test scores initially.
* **C: Iti 2013 a nangabak iti Nasional a Superintendent iti Tawen:** While this is true, the question asks what was *not* in the report, and the report focused on test scores, not Hall's title.
* **D: Singasing para iti panagbalbaliw ti edukasion iti siudad:** The report focused on the *results* of education, specifically test scores, not a broader opinion or advocacy.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania nga impormasion ti naammuan kalpasan ti pannakabomba?","The correct answer is **D: Ti opisial a bilang ti natay**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ti opisial a bilang ket kinompirmana nga umabot iti 30 ti nadangran..."" (the official count was confirmed to be 30 people injured...).
* While the passage mentions other details like the location of the bombings and the initial reports of casualties, the most *confirmed* information available is the official number of injured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti maudi a bilang ti pannakadangran** - The passage says the *latest count* isn't known yet, so this is incorrect.
* **B: Ania dagiti pasdek nga asideg ti pinagsabugan dagiti bomba** - The passage mentions the bombings occurred in various government buildings, but doesn't provide a specific list.
* **C: No mapabettak dagiti kanayonan a bomba** -  The passage doesn't mention whether the remaining bombs were recovered.



"
"Manipud idi nakikadua iti Manchester City idi 2017, mano a laban ti nagay-ayaman ni Jesus?","The correct answer is **A: 24**.

The question asks how many goals Jesus scored for Manchester City since joining in 2017. The passage states he scored 24 goals in 53 matches.
"
Ania a club ti nakaawat ni Jesus iti £27 milion a bayad gapu iti pannakikaduana?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The text states: ""Idi Enero itay napan a tawen 2017, ti 21-anyos a ni Jesus ket nakikadua iti Manchester City..."" This directly indicates that Manchester City was the club that signed him.
"
Ania a keddeng maipapan kadagiti sangaili iti hostel ti saan a pudno?,"The correct answer is **A: Adda dagiti sangaili idiay Mecca para iti panagperegrino** (There are pilgrims in Mecca for pilgrimage).

Here's why:

The passage states that Maysa, a hostel, was flooded in Mecca during the Hajj pilgrimage. The Hajj is a major pilgrimage in Islam. Therefore, the presence of pilgrims is directly related to the event described.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ti dadduma a sangaili ket saan a lokal nga umili** (The other pilgrims are not local people). While many pilgrims *are* from outside Saudi Arabia, the passage doesn't highlight this as a defining characteristic. The key point is that they are pilgrims.
*   **C: Adda sadiay dagiti sangaili para iti bisperas ti hajj** (There are pilgrims there for the days before Hajj). The passage doesn't specifically mention pilgrims arriving *before* the main Hajj event.
*   **D: Kaadduan kadagiti sangaili ket naggapu iti nasantuan a siudad** (Many pilgrims come from holy cities). This is not the primary reason for the flooding and is not directly stated in the passage.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti pudno?","The correct answer is **A: Awan ti natay (No deaths)**.

The text states: ""Kaadduan kadagiti bisita iti pagtarusan ket agtaltalinaed iti United Arab Emirates. Ti bilang dagiti natay ket saan a bumaba iti 15, bilang a manamnama pay a ngumato."" This translates to: ""The majority of visitors come from the United Arab Emirates. The number of deaths is not less than 15, a number that hopes to recover.""

The phrasing ""Ti bilang dagiti natay ket saan a bumaba iti 15"" (The number of deaths is not less than 15) implies that the number of deaths is *at least* 15, not that there were any deaths.  Therefore, the statement ""Awan ti natay"" (No deaths) is incorrect.

However, the question asks which statement is supported by the text. The text *does* state that the number of deaths is ""not less than 15"".  The options provided do not include a statement about the number of deaths. Therefore, based *solely* on the information provided in the question and answers, the closest (though still not perfectly accurate) answer is that no deaths are mentioned.

Let's examine the other options:

* **B: Amin dagiti sangaili ket naggapu idiay United Arab Emirates (All pilgrims come from the United Arab Emirates):** The text says the majority come from the UAE, not *all*.
* **C: Adda sadiay dagiti sangaili para iti bisperas ti hajj pilgrimage (There are pilgrims there for the days before the hajj pilgrimage):** The text doesn't mention pilgrims being there *before* the pilgrimage.
* **D: Kaaduan kadagiti sangaili ket dagiti lumugar ti Mecca (The majority of pilgrims are residents of Mecca):** The text says the majority come from the UAE, not Mecca.

Therefore, considering the options and the text, **A (Awan ti natay)** is the most reasonable answer because the text states that the number of deaths is not less than 15, implying that no deaths were mentioned or confirmed.  However, it's important to recognize that the text doesn't explicitly say ""No deaths"".



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania nga impormasion maipapan iti panagdinnungpar ti saan a di masigurado?","The correct answer is **C: Ti epekto ti panagdinnungpar iti Daga**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Kuna dagiti sientista nga iti panagsabogna a maigapu ti panagdungpar ket napigsa."" (Scientists believe that the debris from the explosion is accumulating over time.) This implies that the *amount* of debris is somewhat certain, but the *long-term effects* on the Earth (specifically the ""Daga"" which likely means Earth) are still uncertain. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti kadakkel ti panagdinnungpar (The size of the explosion):** The passage clearly states the satellite weighed 1,000 pounds and was traveling at 17,500 mph, which allows for a reasonable estimation of the explosion's size.
* **B: Ti lokasion ti panagdinnungpar (The location of the explosion):** While not explicitly stated, the passage mentions the debris is being tracked and a website will publish the results of tracking, suggesting the location is being determined.
* **D: Ti lokasion dagiti debris (The location of the debris):** The passage states that the debris is being tracked and that a public website will publish the tracking results, so the location of the debris is being determined.



Therefore, the only uncertain information is the long-term effects of the debris accumulation on Earth.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania pay ti masapul a maikeddeng maipapan iti panagdinnungpar?","The correct answer is **D: Ti eksakto a rukod ti pannakadungpar (The exact trajectory of the debris)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists believe the debris will persist for a long time, *but* the exact trajectory of where it will fall is still unknown. The US Strategic Command is working to track this. This implies that determining the precise impact location is the remaining crucial piece of information.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Asinno ti mangasikaso iti panagsurot iti debris (Managing space debris):** While managing space debris is related, the passage focuses specifically on understanding the *trajectory* of this particular debris.
* **B: Kapartak ti panagdaliasat dagiti satellite idi tiempo ti panagdinnungparda (Monitoring satellites during the time of the explosion):**  This is related to the initial event but not the ongoing concern about the debris's path.
* **C: No kasano a maibinglay dagiti resulta ti plotting analysis (How the results of plotting analysis are incorporated):** The passage mentions plotting analysis *is* being done, but the key takeaway is that the trajectory itself is still being determined.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a rangko ti dati nga iggem ni Batten iti listaan ti Kabaknangan nga Amerikano?","The correct answer is **C: Maika-190**.

The text states: ""Ni Batten ket nairangko ti maika-190 ti listaan ti 400 a Kabaknangan a Amerikano idi 2008 nga addaan ti mapatpatangan a kinabaknangna a $2.3 a bilion...""
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nagdonaran ni Batten?,"The correct answer is **B: Iti Unibersidad ti Virginia**.

The text explicitly states: ""...maysa a nangruna nga agindondonar iti dayta nga institusion.""  ""Dayta nga institusion"" refers to the University of Virginia, where he was a prominent donor.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti listaan ti Kabaknangan a Amerikano:** While he was on the list, the question asks *what* he donated *to*, not *where* he was listed.
* **C: Maysa a naisangsangayan a bilang dagiti institusion:** This is too general. The text focuses on the University of Virginia.
* **D: Kolehio a naidedikar iti arte ken siensia:** This describes the College of Arts & Sciences *within* the University of Virginia, but the question is about where the donations were made.



"
Ania ti saan a paset ti linteg a pinirmaan ni Gobernador Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: Maiparit ti panaglako wenno panagabang kadagiti naranggas a video game kadagiti menor de edad iti ruar ti California.**

Here's why:

* The question states the law specifically addresses the sale/distribution of **violent animals** to minors. 
* Option C discusses violent video games and sales outside of California. This is unrelated to the law described in the question.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Maiparit ti panaglako wenno panagabang kadagiti naranggas a video game kadagiti menor de edad iti intero a California:** This is not mentioned in the question.
* **B: Kuarta a multa para kadagiti nakabasol:** The question states a $1000 fine per violation.
* **D: Maysa a decal requirement kadagiti naranggas nga ay-ayam:** The question states that violent animal sales must be marked with a ""18"" decal.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti saan a nakangngeg kadagiti banag a maibagbaga?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The text states: ""Adu la unay ti sawsawen ni Mike bayat ti bista… agsagsaganaak idi isu a saanko unay a nangngegan ti imbagbagana."" This translates to ""Mike talked a lot during the visit... I was so busy that I didn't hear much of what he said."" Therefore, Miller didn't hear much of what Mike said.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pudno iti kapadasan ni Miller iti bista ti kaso?","The correct answer is **B: Saan nga agim-imdeng bayat ti panagsaganana.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Adu la unay ti sawsawen ni Mike bayat ti bista… agsagsaganaak idi isu a saanko unay a nangngegan ti imbagbagana.""  This translates to: ""Mike talked a lot during the visit... I was so busy that I couldn't really hear what he was saying.""

This directly indicates that Miller was unable to pay attention due to the amount of talking happening and was therefore not able to fully absorb or appreciate Duvall's story.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Adda impresion ni Duvall ken ni Miller bayat ti bista ti kaso** - The passage indicates that Duvall didn't make a big impression on Miller.
*   **C: Adu ti nagsaritaan ti dua nga annak ni Duvall bayat ti bista ti kaso** - The passage focuses on Mike Duvall (the father) and not his children.
*   **D: Sipapasnek ti panangasikasona iti istoria ni Duvall** - The passage doesn't suggest that Miller was skeptical of Duvall's story.



"
Asinno ti nangisingasing a maaramid dagiti rebision iti ‘Clean Air Act’?,"The correct answer is **A: John Howard**.

The passage states: ""Imbaga ti Prime Minister a ni **Joh Howard** a ti linteg ket para laeng masalakniban dagiti pasilidad ti ospital kontra iti pannakaibaba ti gradoda ti Gobierno ti Tasmania...""

While the Conservative party is mentioned as the enacting party, the question asks *who* said the law was for the stated reason. The passage attributes that statement to Prime Minister John Howard. Stephen Harper is not mentioned in the text. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.
"
Asinno ti nangsuppiat a ti “Clean Air Act” ket maus-usar a pre-election stunt?,"The correct answer is **C: Maysa a lider ti NDP**.

The text explicitly states: ""Indawat ni Layton ti pannakabalbaliw iti gakat dagiti konserbatibo para iti aglawlaw kabayatan ti pannakitaripnong iti PM, a dumawdawat iti “maminpinsan ken kompleto a pannakabaliw ti pannakaisurat” ti gakat para iti aglawlaw ti partido a Konserbatibo."" This translates to ""Layton welcomed the reversal by the Conservatives regarding the ongoing discussion with the PM, criticizing the party's ""occasional and complete madness of writing"" for the party's pre-election agenda."" This indicates Jack Layton, the NDP leader, accused the Conservatives of using the ""Clean Air Act"" as a pre-election stunt.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti opisial ti gobierno ti estado** - The state government is accused of a different action (funding for Mersey hospital)
*   **B: Maysa a Primero Ministro** - While the Prime Minister is mentioned, the accusation is directed at the Conservatives, not the Prime Minister himself.
*   **D: Maysa a pederal nga MP** - While federal MPs are mentioned in relation to the hospital funding, the specific accusation about the ""Clean Air Act"" pre-election stunt is made against the Conservatives and voiced by Layton.



"
Ania ti nabukel dagiti compound a cyanuric acid ken melamine idi nagreaksionda iti maysa ken maysa iti isbo ti pusa?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti crystal**.

The passage states: ""Napaliiw dagiti managsirarak a mabuo dagiti kristal ti isbo iti pusa no manayunan iti melamine ken asido a cyanuric."" (Researchers have clarified that crystals of urine can form in cats if exposed to melamine and cyanuric acid.)  Therefore, the reaction results in the formation of crystals.
"
Ania ti inusar dagiti managsirarak nga infrared spectroscopy tapno mapaliiwda?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti nangbukel kadagitoy a kristal iti isbo ti taraken**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The crystallized substances formed from melamine and cyanuric acid, which were found in the urine of affected individuals, were identified by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""  Therefore, FTIR was used to identify the *crystallized substances* found in the urine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagobra ti bekkel (Kidney function):** While the crystals affect kidney function, FTIR doesn't directly analyze kidney function. It analyzes the *composition* of the crystals.
*   **C: Naapektaran a taraken (Affected individuals):** FTIR analyzed *samples* from affected individuals (urine), but it wasn't analyzing the individuals themselves.
*   **D: Kontaminado a makan ti taraken (Contaminated food):** While the crystals originated from contaminated food, FTIR analyzed the *crystals found in the urine* of the affected individuals, not the food itself.



"
Asinno ti nangtukoy ken ni Luna kas “Reyna ti Extreme”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Kuna ni Tommy Dreamer “ni Luna ti immuna a Reyna ti Extreme.”"" This directly translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said 'Luna is the first Queen of Extreme.'""
"
Asinno ti nangiladawan ken ni Luna kas “saan a kadawyan”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kuna ni Tommy Dreamer “ni Luna ti immuna a Reyna ti Extreme. Umuna a manedierko. Pimmusay ni Luna iti rabii ti dua a bulan. Sabsabali isuna. Napigsa a babai.”"" This directly attributes the description of Luna as ""immuna a Reyna ti Extreme"" and ""napigsa a babai"" to Tommy Dreamer.

While Dustin Runnels also speaks highly of Luna, it's Tommy Dreamer who explicitly labels her as ""immuna a Reyna ti Extreme"" in the provided text. The investigators and fans are not mentioned as giving this description.



"
Ania ti saan a napasamak iti agmanmaneho a nairaman iti pannakadungpar?,"The correct answer is **B: Saanna a nadangran ti siasinoman kadagiti tattao iti uneg ti pagtaengan.**

The text explicitly states: ""Uray no tallo a tattao ti adda iti uneg ti balay idi mabangga daytoy ti kotse, awan ti nasaktan kadakuada."" (Although three people were in the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nagsagaba iti pannakadunor iti ulona:** The text says he suffered a serious head injury (""naglak-am iti serioso a pannakadunor iti ulona"").
* **C: Naiyakar isuna manipud iti ospital idiay Cambridge agingga iti maysa idiay Great Yarmouth:** While he was moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge *after* being initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth, the question asks what *didn't* happen, and the text emphasizes that the people in the house weren't injured.
* **D: Timmulong dagiti serbisio ti emerhensia a nangikkat kenkuana iti luganna:** The text mentions emergency services were at the scene, but the question asks what *didn't* happen. The focus of the question is on the injuries to the people in the house.



"
Ania ti saan a naisangsangayan iti gameplay ti South Africa bayat ti torneo ti rugby?,"The correct answer is **C: Nalaing nga ay-ayam iti rugi ti torneo (Excellent attack in the tournament)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ti nadisplina a depensada, kinalaingda a mangiturong ti bola ken namayat a panagkaykaysa ti garaw ti teamda ket isu ti nangpalatak kadakuada..."". This highlights their strong defense, good ball handling, and team cohesion.  

While the text mentions a strong defense, ball handling, and teamwork, it *doesn't* explicitly state they had an *excellent* attack.  The passage focuses more on their defensive and cohesive strengths as the reason for their victory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makaay-ayo a panagkaykaysa ti garaw (Excellent team cohesion):** The text *does* mention excellent team cohesion.
*   **B: Kabaelan ti panangiggem iti bola (Good ball handling):** The text *does* mention good ball handling.
*   **D: Paglaingan iti depensa (Strong defense):** The text *does* mention strong defense.



Therefore, the only option that is **not** explicitly mentioned as a strength in their gameplay is an excellent attack."
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a nangrugi a simmayaat ti ay-ayam ti South Africa?","The correct answer is **C: Kalpasan a naabak iti Zambia**.

The text states: ""Dagiti adda iti ngato ti torneo a South Africa ket nagrugi iti umno a gundaway idi linaklakada ti mangabak 26-00 kontra ti adda iti maika-5 a Zambia."" which translates to ""The teams in the South Africa tournament started with a resounding victory after beating the 5th ranked Zambia 26-00.""

Therefore, the rugby match started after South Africa won against Zambia.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiyanninaw iti ekonomia ti Tsina?","The correct answer is **C: Mabalin a dakdakkel ti GDP ti Tsina inton agangay ngem ti Estados Unidos.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""The GDP of China could be larger than that of the United States in two decades."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dakkel ti dimmakkel ti ekonomia ti Tsina sipud idi nangaramid kadagiti reporma:** While true, this is a general statement. The question asks about *unseen* challenges, and this isn't a specific challenge mentioned.
* **B: Dakdakkel ti merkado ti Tsina iti panageksport iti kotse ngem ti Estados Unidos:**  The passage mentions China exporting *more* cars than Germany and the US, but it doesn't say the market *itself* isn't a challenge. It's a fact about export volume.
* **D: Saan pay a pulos nga ad-adu ti nailako ti Tsina a kotse ngem ti Germany:** This is factually incorrect according to the passage. China *has* exported more cars than Germany.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a mabalin a lab-awan ti GDP ti Tsina ti Estados Unidos?","The correct answer is **B: Iti las-ud ti dua a dekada.**

The passage states: ""Ti GDP ti Tsina ket mabalin dakdakketonl ngem iti Estados Unidos iti uneg ti dua a dekada."" This directly translates to: ""The GDP of China could surpass that of the United States within two decades.""
"
Ania ti insingasing ni Hu nga aramiden dagiti napanglaw a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **A: Alaen dagiti obligasion a mangiduron iti tukad ti panagdur-asda.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Hu told developed countries to ""not demand that they take on obligations that exceed their level of development, responsibility, and capacity.""  This means he wants developed countries to *avoid* taking on burdens that are disproportionate to their ability to handle them.  Essentially, he's arguing they shouldn't be forced to take on obligations that would hinder their economic progress or unfairly burden them.  This directly relates to ""avoiding obligations that would impede development.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ipamaysam ti ekonomiko nga output:** The passage doesn't mention anything about promoting economic output.
* **C: Lumabes kadagiti agdama a responsibilidad:** This is the opposite of what Hu is advocating. He's arguing *against* taking on additional responsibilities beyond what is reasonable.
* **D: Panangliklik kadagiti daan a dalan ti polusion:** While related to the overall topic, the passage doesn't explicitly say Hu wants to revert to old polluting methods. He's focusing on equitable responsibility.



"
Ania ti saan a nadakamat ni Hu?,"The correct answer is **C: Petsa a manamnama a makissayan dagiti emission ti carbon**.

Here's why:

The question asks what Hu *didn't* state.  The passage clearly states Hu *did* discuss:

* **The relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and GDP:**  He talked about whether the rate of emission reduction was sufficient given China's GDP growth.
* **The need for China to prioritize economic development:** He stressed that China should focus on its own economic progress first.
* **Criticism of developed nations:** He criticized developed nations for pressuring developing nations to take on obligations beyond their capacity.

The passage *doesn't* mention any specific timeline or date for when Hu expects carbon emissions to be reduced. Options A, B, and D are all discussed in the passage.
"
Para iti ania kadagiti sumaganad ti imbaga ni Veerman a saan a nasayaat ti kasasaad?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

Richard Veerman states, ""Angola iti kakaruan a panagraira ti kolera ket agtultuloy a dakes ti kasasaad ti Angola."" This directly indicates that the situation *in Angola* is bad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Medecines Sans Frontieres:** Veerman is representing MSF, so he wouldn't say they are in a bad situation.
* **C: Mangola:** Mangola is mentioned as a medical charity, not the country experiencing the bad situation.
* **D: Ti World Health Organization:** Similar to MSF, the WHO is an organization responding to the crisis, not the entity experiencing the bad situation itself.

"Gapu iti prosecution, asinno ti mangala iti posision ni Huhne’s Cabinet?","The correct answer is **C: Lamb**.

The question states: ""Norman Lamb MP ti manamnama a mangala iti trabaho ti Ministro ti Negosio a mapanawan ni Davey."" (Norman Lamb MP is hoping to get the job of Business Secretary vacated by Davey.)
"
Asinno ti mangala iti trabaho ti Ministro ti Negosio kalpasan ti pannakaidarum?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP ti manamnama a mangala iti trabaho ti Ministro ti Negosio a mapanawan ni Davey.""  This directly translates to ""Norman Lamb MP is hoping to get the job of Business Secretary to replace Davey.""
"
Ania ti paregtaen dagiti agpabuya nga aramiden dagiti agbuybuya bayat ti opera ni Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **C: Makikadua kadakuada iti entablado para iti pabuya.**

The prompt explicitly states that the actors were smoking cannabis on stage and that the theater itself allowed them to be present on stage during the performance. Options A and B are incorrect as they describe the subject matter of the opera, not the actors' actions. Option D is incorrect because the actors were actively engaging in drug use *during* the performance.



"
Asinno ti kangrunaan nga agsigsigarilio kadagiti kasukat bayat ti opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti agpabpabuya (The performers)**.

The text states that ""dagiti agpabuya iti sigarilio a cannabis iti entablado"" which translates to ""the performers smoked cannabis on stage."" Therefore, the performers are the ones smoking during the opera.
"
Ania ti sabali pay a nagan ti “spacewalk” nga inaramid ni Leonov?,"The correct answer is **C: Extravehicular nga aktibidad**.

The text states that Leonov performed the first EVA (extravehicular activity). ""Spacewalk"" is a common, more easily understood term for EVA. While the other options are related to Leonov's career, they are not the specific name for the activity itself.
"
Indauluan ni Leonov ti Soviet a paset ti ania a mision?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Sangapulo a tawen ti naglabas, indauluanna ti parte ti Soviet iti mision nga Apollo-Soyuz a mangisimbolo a nalpasen ti Panagsasalisal iti Law-ang."" This translates to ""Ten years later, he participated in the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which symbolized the end of the Space Race.""
"
Asinno ti nadangran iti pannakadungpar?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti nangiturong ti trak**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti nangiturong ti trak, nga agtawen ti 64, ket saan a nadangran iti panagdinnungpar."" which translates to ""The truck driver, who is 64 years old, was not found to be at fault.""
"
Ania ti napasamak kadagiti tattao a nairaman iti aksidente?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa ti saan a nadangran, maysa ti natay**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kalpasan a mapasamak ti aksidente, naipan ni Gibson iti maysa nga ospital ngem saan a nagbayag ket natay met laeng."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to a hospital but did not pay and died.)
* It also says: ""Ti nangiturong ti trak, nga agtawen ti 64, ket saan a nadangran iti panagdinnungpar."" (The truck driver, who was 64 years old, was not found guilty.)

This indicates one person (Gibson) died, and the driver was not charged, implying no one was held legally responsible. Therefore, two people were directly affected: one died, and one was not charged (meaning they were not injured enough to be charged).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Natay isuda a dua** (They all died): Only Gibson is explicitly stated to have died.
* **C: Agpukpukkaw ken agsangsangitda** (They were confused and agitated): This describes what a witness saw, not what happened *to* the people involved.
* **D: Agpada a nasugatan** (They were all injured):  Only Gibson is confirmed to have been injured severely enough to die. The driver wasn't charged, but that doesn't necessarily mean they weren't injured.



"
Mangnamnama dagiti sientista nga agtartrabaho iti programa a mapaliiwda dagiti epekto a patauden ti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **C: Battit a banbanag (Gravitational forces)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ang epekto a sapsapulen ti grupo ket ti makaigapu kadagiti puersa ti gravity iti nabaetan ti dark matter ti galaxy ken ti dark matter ti Milky Way.""  This translates to ""The effect experienced by the group comes from the gravitational forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.""

Therefore, the scientists are hoping to understand the effects caused by **gravitational forces**.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kanayon a banag (Constant forces)** - While gravity is a constant force, the passage focuses on the *specific effects* of gravitational forces, not just the general concept of constant forces.
*   **B: Dagiti puersa ti panagayus ti danum (Water regulation forces)** - Water regulation forces are mentioned as an analogy to the Milky Way's interaction with the Sagittarius galaxy, but not as the primary factor the scientists are trying to understand.
*   **D: Nalimed a banag (Nuclear forces)** - Nuclear forces operate within the nucleus of atoms, and are not the primary driver of the interactions between galaxies, or the effects of dark matter as described in the passage."
Napaliiw idi dagiti sientista ti banag ti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **D: Itit Sagittarius galaxy ken iti Milky Way**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the program was designed to emulate observations of the **Sagittarius galaxy** and that the gravitational effect on the group is due to the **dark matter of the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way**.  It also compares the Milky Way's gravitational influence on Sagittarius to the Moon's influence on the Earth.

Therefore, the scientists clarified the **Milky Way and Sagittarius galaxy**.
"
"Segun iti paset, ania ti saan a dildillawen dagiti konserbatibo?","The correct answer is **D: Gastos iti rekonstruksion**.

Here's why:

The passage states that conservative fiscalists called the situation ""Bush's New Orleans Deal"" *due to the controversy surrounding the cost of aid and reconstruction*. This implies they weren't necessarily against the *cost* of reconstruction itself, but rather the way the aid and reconstruction funds were being managed and distributed.  The core issue was the financial aspect of the reconstruction efforts, not the reconstruction itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pannakagastos ti ayuda (Cost of aid):** The passage explicitly mentions controversy *surrounding the cost of aid*.
* **B: Ti kinakurang ti panagregget a mangrekonstruksion (Lack of fiscal responsibility in reconstruction):**  While the ""deal"" was criticized for a lack of fiscal responsibility, the question asks what conservatives *didn't* dissent from.
* **C: Siasino ti maipapaayan iti kontrata iti rekonstruksion (Who gets the reconstruction contracts):** The passage indicates criticism regarding the awarding of contracts to Washington insiders, suggesting dissatisfaction with *who* received the contracts, not necessarily the contracts themselves.



"
Asinno ti mangdildillaw kadagiti kontrata ti rekonstruksion kadagiti panagregget ti Bagyo a Katrina a mangsaranay?,"The correct answer is **A: Konserbatibo iti piskal (Fiscal conservatives)**.

The text explicitly states that ""sumagmamano a konserbatibo a piskal"" (many fiscal conservatives) called the deal ""Bush's New Orleans Deal"" and were critical of the contracting practices. Therefore, fiscal conservatives are identified as the ones who criticized the reconstruction contracts.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ti umuna a makita dagiti silaw manipud iti spacecraft ti Stardust?","The correct answer is **B: Amianan ti California**.

The text states: ""Umakar dayta a bumallasiw ti akinlaud nga igid-baybay ti **umamianan a California** ken silnaganna ti tangatang...""  (It soared along the coastal ridge of **Northern California** and to the east of the ridge across the tangatang...)

While the spacecraft passed over other states, the text explicitly mentions Northern California as the starting point of its flight path.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti spacecraft ket mangipasdek iti rekord para iti ania kadagiti sumaganad?","The correct answer is **C: Panagsubli ditoy Daga ti kapartakan**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti Stardust ket mangidasar ti baro a rekord a kas kapapaspasan a spacecraft nga agsubli iti Daga, a mangatiw ti daan a nairekord idi Mayo ti 1969 kabayatan ti panagsubli ti Apollo X modiul komando.""
"
Kasano a nainaig ni Dr. Malar Balasubramanian ken ni Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Ina**.

The text states that Saroja Balasubramanian was Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother (""bagi ni Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, a naabbongan iti daradara nga ules"").
"
Sadinno ti nakasarakan ti bagi ni Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: Sikigan iti kalsada (On the side of the road)**.

The text states: ""Inturongna dagiti opisial iti nangisit nga Oldsmobile Intrigue a luganna a 500 kadapan ti kaadayona. Sadiay, nasarakanda ti bagi ni Saroja Balasubramanian..."" which translates to ""Officials pointed to the dark Oldsmobile Intrigue car 500 yards ahead of the scene. There, they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian...""  This indicates the body was found on the side of the road.
"
Ania ti nagatang ti eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states: ""Daytoy ti kadakkelan pay laeng a kompania a nagatang ti eBay...a makaala ti kinalatak dagiti lugar a ti Skype ket mangeggem ti napigsa a posision...""  This directly indicates that Skype is the company being referred to as a competitor of eBay.
"
Ania ti sapsapulen ti eBay a maragpat babaen ti pannakagatang?,"The correct answer is **B: Palawaem kadagiti baro a teritoria (Expanding into new territories)**.

The passage states that eBay hopes to gain a stronger position in areas like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This directly relates to expanding into new geographical markets.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pagtitipunen ti kitana (Gathering data)** - While data collection might be a byproduct, it's not the primary goal mentioned.
*   **C: Ipangato ti profile-na (Improving its profile)** - While expansion can improve a company's profile, the text focuses on geographic expansion specifically.
*   **D: Penneken dagiti shareholders-na (Pleasing its shareholders)** - This is a general business goal, but not directly stated as the *reason* for the expansion.

"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti saan a nakilanglangen kadagiti balud a nagtalinaed iti paraangan kalpasan ti panaglalaban?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti tripulante a mangispal iti uram (Security officers on duty)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that officials ""sinerrek dagiti opisial nga addaan itiriot gear ti arubayan ket tiniliwda dagiti preso usar ti tear gas"" (officials ordered the security personnel to use riot gear and tear gas on the prisoners). 
* This implies that the security personnel were *part of the force* used to control the situation, not those who were *not* involved.
* The passage mentions negotiators, officials, and hospital employees as being present, but it doesn't state that the security personnel were *not* present or involved.
* Therefore, the security officers are the ones who weren't mentioned as being part of the group that stayed in the courtyard.




"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakaigapuan ti panagatras dagiti balud kamaudiananna manipud iti riribuk?,"The correct answer is **B: Tear gas**.

The text explicitly states: ""Saan a nabayag, sinerrek dagiti opisial nga addaan itiriot gear ti arubayan ket tiniliwda dagiti preso usar ti tear gas."" (It is not known, officials deployed riot gear and used tear gas against the prisoners.)

While negotiation was attempted (A) and the prisoners were scared (D), the text directly identifies tear gas as the method used to disperse the riot. Option C is not supported by the text.
"
"Iti panagkuna ni Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ania ti rumbeng a wayawayaan ti pagilian ti Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Pinansial a restriksion**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ti panagpannuray iti langis a kas “maysa a palab-og” sakbay pay laeng ti Islamiko a rebolusion ti Iran idi 1979 ket masapul a mawayawayaan ti pagilian iti daytoy."" This translates to: ""The oil sanctions are like a 'sword' that the country needs to overcome since the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979.""  The ""sword"" metaphor implies a form of pressure or restriction, which in this context refers to financial restrictions imposed on Iran due to its oil industry.

While the other options are related to the situation, they are not the direct answer to *what* needs to be overcome.

* **B: Ti Islamiko a rebolusion** is the historical context.
* **C: Baniaga a kita** is a result of the sanctions, not what needs to be overcome.
* **D: Maysa a panagpannuray iti langis** is the sanctions themselves, not the consequence that needs to be overcome.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti nangaklon kadagiti epekto ti sanction iti ekonomia ti Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Senior a pammataudan**.

The text states: ""Dagiti komento, a live iti telebision, ti kaunaan a gundaway a ti maysa dagiti senior nga Iranian a taudan ti impormasion ket inakoda nga awan unay epekto dagiti naipakat a pananglapped.""  This directly indicates that senior Iranian officials are commenting on the impact of the sanctions. While OPEC and Ayatollah Khamenei also mention the impact, the initial commentary and the focus of the paragraph are on the senior Iranian officials' assessment.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan kadi a paset ti proseso ti panagbutos ti France?,"The correct answer is **A: Transparent a kahon ti panagbutos (Transparent ballot box)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that voters deposit their ballots in a booth and then place them in an envelope, which is then inserted into the ballot box. It also mentions that ballot boxes are opened at the end of the voting period and that there are specific procedures for counting.  There's no mention of a *transparent* ballot box.
* The passage *does* mention:
    * **B: Dagiti representante nga imbaon dagiti kandidato (Representatives invited by candidates):** Candidates can invite representatives to observe the entire process.
    * **C: Panagpirma iti listaan dagiti agbotos (Signing the voting roll):** Voters sign the voting roll after the officials verify their identity.
    * **D: Butos a binilang dagiti representante ti kandidato (Ballots counted by candidate representatives):**  While not directly stated, the passage implies that representatives can be present to observe the ballot counting process.



Therefore, a transparent ballot box is the element *not* described in the passage.



"
Sadinno ti pangipakitaan dagiti botante iti pinilida a kandidato?,"The correct answer is **B: Iti naimprentaan a panid ti papel**.

The passage states: ""dagiti agbotos ket isinada ti bagbagida iti maysa a booth, mangipan iti naimprentaan a papel a mangibaga ti binutosanda iti maysa a sobre."" This translates to: ""voters are taken to a booth, they mark a printed paper indicating who they voted for on an envelope.""
"
Ania ti nangiturong ken ni Allen a mangrugi iti walo a tawen a panagbirok kadagiti Musashi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti interesna iti gubat (his interest in war)**.

The text states: ""Maysa kadagiti kababaknangan ditoy lubong, naibaga a ni Allen ket nangikabil iti adu a kinabaknangna iti panagsukisok iti marino ken iti panagsapulna iti Musashi gapu iti tunggal-biag nga interesna kadagidiay a giera."" This translates to: ""One of the wonders of the world, it was said that Allen invested his vast wealth in marine exploration and in the Musashi due to his personal interest in those wars.""

Therefore, his *interest in war* is what motivated his eight years of service to the Musashi. While the other options are related to his activities, they are not the primary reason he started his long service. His interest in war is the underlying motivation.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti nagastos ni Allen iti dakkel a gatad ti kuartana?","The correct answer is **A: Panangisubli iti Musashi**.

The passage states: ""Maysa kadagiti kababaknangan ditoy lubong, naibaga a ni Allen ket nangikabil iti adu a kinabaknangna iti panagsukisok iti marino **ken iti panagsapulna iti Musashi** gapu iti tunggal-biag nga interesna kadagidiay a giera."" This indicates that investing in the Musashi was a significant expenditure.  While he also engaged in deep-sea exploration, the passage highlights the Musashi as a major investment.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nalabit nangiturong kadagiti napeggad a kasasaad iti uneg ken aglawlaw ti mula?","The correct answer is **B: Radioaktibo a casesium**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the Japanese nuclear agency found radioactive cesium and iodine at the Fukushima plant.
* The report mentions that residents were advised to keep windows closed to prevent contamination and to not drink tap water. These are direct consequences of radioactive contamination.
* While uranium fuel was involved, the immediate concern and the specific radioactive elements identified are cesium and iodine.
* ""Puraw nga asuk"" (yellow sugar) is the initial description of the plant's release, but the report focuses on the *radioactive* consequences.



Therefore, radioactive cesium is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maysa kadagiti singasing iti kinatalged a naisingasing kadagiti lokal nga umili kalpasan ti pasamak iti planta?,"The correct answer is **C: Liklikan ti panaglang-ab iti puraw nga asuk (Avoiding consuming purple sugar)**.

Here's why:

* The question states the reports on television were about **purple rain** (puraw nga asuk).  The text specifically mentions concerns about the radioactive elements cesium and iodine being released from the Fukushima plant. While the text details the dangers of radioactive contamination, it *doesn't* mention concerns about consuming purple sugar.
* The other options (avoiding air conditioning, staying indoors, and avoiding tap water) are all directly linked to concerns about radiation exposure and contamination as described in the text.

Therefore, avoiding purple sugar is the only option that isn't mentioned as a concern related to the Fukushima plant incident.



"
"Segun ken Dr. Moll, ania ti pakaseknan unay maipapan iti XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Ti nangato ti fatality rate na** (The high fatality rate).

Here's why:

* The question states: ""kinunana a ti klasena ket “nakabutbuteng ken makapadanag gapu ti nakangatngato a bilang ti patayenna”"" which translates to ""he described the strain as 'deadly and dangerous due to its high mortality rate'.""

While the other options are related to XDR-TB, the *primary* concern Dr. Moll highlights is its high fatality rate. He emphasizes the severity and danger of the strain because it kills so many people.
"
Mano a pasiente a nakaptan iti baro a variant ti nakumpirma nga empleado ti panangtaripato iti salun-at?,"The correct answer is **A: 10**.

The text states: ""In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 other people."" Therefore, the answer is 10.
"
Ania a klase ti teknolohia ti us-usaren ti sistema ti NextGen?,"The correct answer is **A: Teknolohia a nakabase iti satellite**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mausar daytoy iti teknolohia a nakabase iti satellite kontra iti daan a teknolohia a nakabase iti radar ti daga..."" (It uses satellite-based technology in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology...)"
Kasano a direkta a magunggonaan ti NextGen dagiti air traffic controller?,"The correct answer is **B: Ad-adda nga eksakto a lokasion dagiti eroplano**.

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen uses satellite-based technology to give air traffic controllers **""the exact location of the plane and provide pilots with accurate information.""**  This directly impacts how air traffic controllers operate.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ab-ababa a ruta ti panagtayab:** While NextGen *can* contribute to more efficient routes, it doesn't directly give air traffic controllers more precise routing information *itself*. The focus is on location tracking.
* **C: Bimmassit ti panangiruar iti karbon:**  Reducing carbon emissions is a *result* of NextGen's technology, but it's not a direct way NextGen benefits air traffic controllers.
* **D: Basbassit nga pagaron:**  The passage doesn't mention fuel savings as a direct benefit to air traffic controllers. It's a broader environmental impact.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan a dinillaw dagiti historiador ti FBI gapu ta naipamaysada?","The correct answer is **B: Panangiyanay kadagiti pammataudan kadagiti nalaka laeng a masolbar a krimen.**

Here's why:

The passage states that historians *criticized* the FBI for focusing resources on high-profile cases to boost public confidence. Option B accurately reflects this criticism – the historians questioned the prioritization of resources *only* for cases deemed high-profile and easily solvable, suggesting a neglect of other, potentially important areas. The passage mentions high-profile cases like sex trafficking and child pornography, implying these were the ones being prioritized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panangparang-ay iti balligida (Erosion of trust):** This is actually *what* the FBI was trying to *prevent* with their focus on high-profile cases. The historians were *concerned* about erosion of trust, not that they highlighted it.
*   **C: Nadagsen ti panangipamaysa kadagiti kaso ti pornograpia (Focus on pornography cases):** The passage specifically mentions the FBI allocating resources to child pornography cases, but it doesn't say the historians objected to this focus itself. They objected to the overall prioritization.
*   **D: Natakaw a kaso ti kotse (Automobile theft cases):** The passage doesn't mention automobile theft cases at all.



"
Ania ti piliten ti inisiatibo para ti kinaalas nga aramiden ti FBI?,"The correct answer is **B: Ipangato ti balligi ti ahensia**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the initiative was intended ""to greatly enhance public trust in the agency."" While the other options might be *results* of the initiative, the primary *purpose* was to improve public perception of the FBI. The other options are consequences of this intended outcome.
"
Ania ti napasamak iti lugan para ti puor a nagresponde iti pannakadungpar ti JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **B: Nagtulid dayta**.

The text states: ""Impadamag ti lokal a media a ti lugan para ti puor ti eropuerto ket nagtulatid kabayatan nga agresresponde."" This translates to: ""Local media reported that the airport's fire department responded immediately and aggressively.""  ""Nag-tulatid"" means ""responded/reacted"". While it could be interpreted as ""attacked"" in a very literal sense, in this context, it means ""responded with force"". Therefore, ""nag-tulid"" (responded) is the most accurate translation and fits the context.
"
"Kalpasan ti pannakadungpar ti JAS 39C Gripen, naiserra ti airport iti ania?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti komersial a biahe**.

The passage states: ""Ti JAS 39C Gripen ket naregregreg ti maysa a pagpatayaban ti oras ti 9:30 am lokal nga oras (0230 UTC) ken bimtak, a nangitunda ti panagrekep ti airport kadagiti komersial a byahe."" (The JAS 39C Gripen was deployed at a time of 9:30 am local time (0230 UTC) and blocked airport access for commercial flights.)
"
Asinno ti nangitukon ni Brzezinski iti panangiwanwan bayat ti Rebolusion ti Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states: ""Kas NSA, tinulunganna ni Carter a diplomatiko a mangasikaso kadagiti aramid ti lubong... iti Robolusion idiay Iran, a nangidaulo ti krisis ti pannakautibo idiay Iran, 1979.""

This directly indicates that Brzezinski worked *with* Carter during the Iranian Revolution, not Kissinger, Kennedy, or Johnson.  While Kissinger was a prominent figure, the passage specifically links Brzezinski's role as NSA during that time to the Carter administration.
"
Asinno ti nagtagtaginayon iti posision ti Advisor ti Nasional a Seguridad agingga 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states: ""simmaruno ken ni Henry Kissinger,"" meaning Kissinger preceded Brzezinski as NSA. It also mentions that Brzezinski served *starting* in 1977.  Therefore, Kissinger held the position until 1977.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga umiso a mangipakita iti karera ni Bobek iti Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Isu ket nakagun-od ti nasurok a 468 a goal bayat ti panagay-ayamna para iti grupo.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Idi panawenna kadua ti grupo, naka-iskor isuna iti 403 a goal iti 468 a panagpakitana."" (During his time with the club, he scored 403 goals in 468 appearances.)
* Option A accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ad-adu ti nagun-odna a goal ngem iti aniaman a sabali a managay-ayam:** While he scored a lot of goals, the text doesn't state he scored more than anyone else in any other period.  It emphasizes his *unique* contribution.
* **C: Isu ket naminsan a nabutos a kalalaingan nga agay-ayam iti pakasaritaan ti grupo:** The text says he was *remembered* for a lack of playing time in later years, not that he was *officially* labeled as having a lack of playing time.
* **D: Ad-adu ti nagparang nga ay-ayam ngem iti aniaman a sabali nga agay-ayam:** The text mentions he had an unparalleled contribution, not that he was the most penalized player in any period.



"
Ania a keddeng maipapan iti pakasaritaan ni Bobek ken ni Partizan Belgrade ti pudno?,"The correct answer is **C: Isu ket nagayam para iti Partizan agingga 1958.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kinaduana ida idi 1945 ken nagbati inggana 1958."" (He joined in 1945 and played until 1958).
* Option A is too short; it only mentions the start date.
* Option B is incorrect; he played *for* Partizan Belgrade, not Zagreb.
* Option D is not the primary or defining detail about his time with the club. While true, it's secondary to the duration of his playing career.

Therefore, option C accurately captures the key aspect of Bobek's relationship with Partizan Belgrade as described in the text. The prompt asks for the most *significant* detail about their history.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a kababalin ti mangilasin iti Hesperonychus manipud iti Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Adda dayta maikadua nga dakdakel nga kuko.**

The text explicitly states: ""Dakdakkel ti maikadua a kukona, nga isu ti nakapanagananna iti Hesperonychus a kayatna a sawen ket “lumaud a kuko.”"" This translates to ""Its second claw is large, which is what led to the name Hesperonychus meaning 'evening claw'.""

The text also mentions that both Hesperonychus and Velociraptor have two claws on their feet. However, the distinguishing feature is the size of the second claw in Hesperonychus.
"
Ti kaipapanan ti “Hesperonychus” ket nagtaud iti ania a pisikal a pakabigbigan ti sebbangan?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti (kuk)kuko (claws)**.

The text explicitly states that the name ""Hesperonychus"" comes from the claws, specifically referencing the large second claw, which is why it's sometimes called ""lumaud a kuko"" (large claw).
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipanggep iti paltugan iti pudno?,"The correct answer is **D: Napasamak ti pammaltog idiay Buffalo.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ti 30-tawen nga asawa a lalaki, a naiyanak idiay Buffalo, ket maysa kadagiti uppat a natay iti pannakapaltog..."" (The 30-year-old husband, born in Buffalo, was one of four who died in the flood...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isuda a dua nga agasawa ket naggapu Texas** - While they celebrated their anniversary in Texas, the text doesn't say they are from Texas, only that they got married there a year prior.
*   **B: Adda lima a nadangranan** - The text says four people died, not five.
*   **C: Nagkallaysada ti agassawa makatawen sakbayna idiay Buffalo** - The text doesn't mention the couple being in Buffalo when the flood occurred."
Ania a keddeng maipapan iti pasamak a nakapasamakan ti pannakapaltog ti pudno?,"The correct answer is **B: Napasamak dayta iti pormal a pannakaangay ti anibersario**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Naituding ti pormal a pannakaangay ti anibersario iti nabaybayag a petsa..."" This directly links the fatal accident to the formal anniversary celebration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Napasamak dayta iti maysa nga anibersario a party idiay Buffalo:** While it happened in Buffalo and involved an anniversary, the passage specifically mentions the *formal anniversary celebration*.
* **C: Napasamak dayta iti maysa a panagrarambak idiay Texas:** The passage says they celebrated their first anniversary in Texas, but the accident didn't happen during the celebration there.
* **D: Napasamak dayta iti kasar dagiti agassawa:** The passage mentions they remarried, but doesn't state the accident happened during their wedding.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti immuna a pakaseknan dagiti opisial maipapan iti Luno?","The correct answer is **D: Posible a pannakadangran dagiti tripulante (Possible crew endangerment)**.

The text states that the initial concern of the officials was the safety of the 122 crew members aboard the Luno, who were at risk due to the storm and potential damage to the vessel. The potential endangerment of the crew would be the immediate priority before focusing on the cargo. 
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan iti pannakadadael ti Luno ti saan a pudno?","The correct answer is **A: Napasamak ti pannakadadael sakbay a naala ti karga.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Daytoy 100 a metro a barko ket mapan nangala iti gagangay a kargana a ganagan ket idi umuna mabuteng dagiti opisial a baka maibelleng iti barko dagiti kargana."" This translates to ""This 100-meter ship was able to take out its heavy cargo, but officials were initially worried it would be damaged by the cargo.""

This indicates that the damage to the Luno occurred *while* the cargo was being unloaded. The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **B: Adda 100 a metro a gasolina ti barko idi nadadael** - While the ship had 100 meters of fuel, the passage doesn't connect the fuel level to the damage.
*   **C: Manipud iti sangapulo ket dua a tripulante, maysa ti nasugatan** -  The passage mentions 122 crew members, but only that they were evacuated. It doesn't say anyone was injured.
*   **D: Naiduron ti barko iti breakwater** - The passage doesn't mention anything about a breakwater.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the damage happened during the cargo unloading process.



"
Iti ania a dekada a nagun-od ti Algeria ti wayawaya?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960s**.

The text states: ""Idi 1960, nagsubli isuna iti nabiit pay a nagwaywayas nga Algeria tapno agisuro iti panagiturong iti pelikula."" (In 1960, he returned to the recently decolonized Algeria to teach filmmaking.) This directly indicates that the Algerian War of Independence was ongoing in the 1960s.
"
Sadinno ti saan a naipasdek nga iskrin dagiti telebision para iti seremonia ti pumpon?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti intero a Roma**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sumagmamano a dadakkel ti iskrinna a telebision ti naipuesto iti nadumaduma a paset ti Roma tapno makabuya dagiti tattao iti seremonia."" (Many large television screens were set up in various parts of Rome so people could watch the ceremony.)  This implies the screens were placed throughout Rome, not just in specific areas. Option A, ""Iti intero a Roma,"" (Throughout Rome) best reflects this.
"
Sadinno ti nakaangayan ti seremonia ti pumpon?,"The correct answer is **C: Idiay St. Peter's Square**.

The text states: ""Nasurok nga uppat a milion a tattao ti napan idiay Roma tapno tumabuno ti lamay...  Sumagmamano a dadakkel ti iskrinna a telebision ti naipuesto iti nadumaduma a paset ti Roma tapno makabuya dagiti tattao iti seremonia."" This indicates the main ceremony took place in St. Peter's Square, with screens set up elsewhere in Rome to allow people to watch. While screens were set up in other places, the main event was *in* St. Peter's Square.

Options A and D are incorrect because while screens were placed in various locations in Rome and other cities, the primary location was St. Peter's Square. Option B is incorrect because while screens were set up in Poland, the main ceremony was in Rome.
"
"Kalpasan ti panagbettak, asinno ti naagasan gapu kadagiti nakaro a pannakadangran?","The correct answer is **A: Di kumurang a lima a tao**.

The text explicitly states: ""Awan ti naipadamag a nakaro a pannakadangra, ngem saan a bumaba iti lima a tao nga adda iti lugar iti kanito ti panagbettak ti naagasan para kadagiti sintomas ti pannakakigtot.""  This translates to: ""No significant injuries were reported, but at least five people who were present at the scene were taken to the hospital with symptoms of poisoning.""



"
Asinno ti nangipadamag iti panagruar ti gas?,"The correct answer is **A: Maysa a kaarruba iti pasdek (A gas leak)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Maysa nga opisial ti kumpania iti gas ti napan idiay nakapasamakanna idi **maysa a karruba ti timmawag maipapan iti simngaw a gas**."" This means the gas leak was caused by a gas leak.

The other options are incorrect based on the information provided.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, mano a tattao ti natay iti panangraut?","The correct answer is **C: 5**.

The text states: ""Pimmalpak ti armas iti Uka bayat a nakatutok iti ulo iti maikalima a lalaki..."" which translates to ""The weapon went off while aimed at the head of the fifth man..."" Therefore, five people were present and one was killed.
"
Akinkua ti armas a naipaay a nagputok iti maysa a punto bayat ti panangraut?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The text states: ""Pimmalpak ti armas iti Uka bayat a nakatutok iti ulo iti maikalima a lalaki..."" which translates to ""The weapon discharged at Uka while pointed at the head of the fifth man...""  ""Uka"" refers to Kristoffer Schneider.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad nga isports ti nabutos nga ikatten iti programa ti Olympics?,"The correct answer is **B: Rugby**.

The text states: ""Napili ti Rugby, kangrunaan ti rugby union, ken ti golf manipud iti lima a dadduma pay nga sport a maikonsidera a maisali iti Olympics."" (Rugby, primarily rugby union, and golf were chosen from five other sports considered for inclusion in the Olympics.)

While the other sports (Squash, Karate, and Baseball/Softball) were considered, only Rugby was chosen. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad nga isports ti binutosan ti International Olympic Committee a mairaman kadagiti ay-ayam?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

The text states: ""Napili ti Rugby, kangrunaan ti rugby union..."" which translates to ""Rugby, primarily rugby union, was chosen..."".
"
Orihinal nga inabangan ni Arthur Guinness ti St James’ Gate Brewery iti mano a tawen?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The question asks how many years Arthur Guinness originally leased the brewery. The passage states: ""Idi Setiembre 24, 1759, nagpirma ni Arthur Guinness ti 9,000 a tawen a panangabang ti St James' Gate Brewery..."" which translates to ""On September 24, 1759, Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease on the St James' Gate Brewery...""
"
Agarup mano a bilion a doliar ti iyeg ti Guinness iti kada tawen?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The passage states: ""ti kumitkita ti nasurok a 10 bilion nga euro (US$14.7 bilyon) kada tawen.""  The question asks for the amount in billions of dollars, and the passage gives that amount as $14.7 billion. Therefore, the best answer among the choices is D, as it reflects the billion dollar amount mentioned in the text.
"
Iti mano a pagilian iti European Union ti nailasin ti H5N1 virus?,"The correct answer is **C: Pito**.

The passage states: ""Ti France ti maikapito a pagilian iti European Union nga agsagaba iti daytoy a virus..."" (France is the seventh country in the European Union to be affected by this virus...)

It then lists the countries affected: Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and France. That's a total of seven.
"
Sadinno a nailasin ti kaudian a kaso ti H5N1 virus?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The passage states: ""Maysa a natay nga atap a pato, a nasarakan idi Lunes, iti kadandanuman nga asideg iti Lyon iti amianan ti France."" (A dead wild bird, which was found on Monday, in the suburbs of Lyon in northern France.)
"
Kaano ti naudi a pannakasabat ti Haiti iti sakit sakbay ti panagsaknap gapu kadagiti mangtaginayon iti kappia?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti 1800s**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sakbay ti panagsangpet dagiti tropa, saan pay a naipasango ti Haiti kadagiti problema a mainaig iti sakit manipud pay idi 1800."" (Even after the troops arrived, Haiti was not yet free from disease problems dating back to the 1800s.)
"
Dagiti basura manipud iti ania a lugar ti nakatulong iti panagwaras ti sakit?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti kampo ti UN**.

The text states: ""Dagiti napabasol iti panagwaras ti sakit a nagrugi iti asideg ti nagkampuan ti buyot. Sigun iti darum, ti basura a naggapu iti kampo iti UN ket saan a na-sanitize a nasayaat...""  This directly points to the UN camp as the source of the pollution and the subsequent spread of disease.
"
Ania ti plano nga aramiden ti gobierno ti Ireland?,"The correct answer is **B: Mangipaulog kadagiti naing-inget a linteg maipapan iti pannakaipalubos ti droga.**

Here's why:

* The text states the government needs to pass legislation to address the situation.
* It mentions the need for measures to protect individuals from temporary illegality due to substance use and to address convictions arising from previously unconstitutional changes.
* This strongly suggests the government is looking at regulating drug use through new laws, not completely decriminalizing (D) or fully legalizing (C). Option A is too narrow; the text speaks to a broader issue of legal processes and convictions related to substance use.



"
Ania ti temporario a legal idiay Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti droga (Drugs)**.

The passage states the government is considering legislation to address the situation of ""temporary legality of certain substances."" The context strongly implies these substances are drugs, given the common association with temporary legal status in discussions about drug policies.
"
Ania ti maimbestigaran ti mapapati a nakabasol?,"The correct answer is **A: Trespassing**.

The text explicitly states: ""Imbaga ni Christopher Garcia, parasarita ti Los Angeles Police Department, a ti lalaki a maatap a naglabsing ket maim-imbestigaran iti **trespassing** imbes a bandalismo."" (Christopher Garcia, a LAPD officer, reported that the homeless man who broke in would be investigated for **trespassing** instead of vandalism.)
"
"Idi binalbaliwanna ti karatula, ania ti saan nga inaramid ti suspek?","The correct answer is **C: Pisikal nga indadael**.

Here's why:

The passage states the suspect *reversed* the sign by using tarpaulins decorated with a peace symbol and heart to make the ""O"" look like an ""e."" This indicates a visual alteration, but not physical damage. The other options are all things the suspect *did* according to the passage.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad iti haan mapabasolen ken maestro ti Ingles a ni Karno?","The correct answer is **C: Panagimprenta kadagiti di autorisado nga anunsio.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Karno was reprimanded for **printing large announcements on buses without permission** and for claiming to be the head teacher of English.  This is the only action listed as causing a reprimand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagsalungasing iti pagpatalged a kukuw ti nagaramid:**  While his accusations might have been controversial, the text doesn't state he was reprimanded *for* making those accusations.
* **B: Agararem iti agad-adal:** The text doesn't mention anything negative about his teaching methods generally.
* **D: Aagus-usar iti dakes a sao iti klase:** The text mentions he used a large voice in class, but it doesn't say this was the reason for the reprimand.

Therefore, the only action directly linked to a reprimand in the provided text is the unauthorized printing of announcements.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti saan a hostage ni Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti pulis**.

Here's why:

The text states that Rolando Mendoza took the tourists hostage. While the hostages included tourists, children, and photographers, it doesn't say he took any police hostage. In fact, the text implies that the hostage situation involved tourists and photographers.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti hostage a saan a nakumpirmaan a nasapa a nawayawayaan?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti turista**.

The text states: ""Adu kadagiti nakautibo iti naisalakan ket kurang nga innem ti nakumpirma a natayen. Innem kadagiti nakautibo, agraman dagiti ubbing ket babbaket ken lallakay, ket napalubosan a nasapa, kasta met laeng dagiti Filipino a retratista.""  This implies that the remaining unidentified victims were tourists. The options B, C, and D list groups *that were* confirmed to be unharmed.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti mangur-urnong kadagiti pirma a mangsuporta iti pannakaipaulog a legal ti panagasawa ti agpada a sekso idiay Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti agproprotesta**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Angnamnama dagiti agproprotesta a makakolektada iti petision a 1.2 a milion a pirma tapno ipresentada iti National Congress inton Nobiembre."" This translates to ""Protesters hope to collect a petition of 1.2 million signatures to present to the National Congress in November.""  Therefore, the protesters are the ones collecting the signatures to support the legalization.
"
Asinno ti pagitedan dagiti agprotprotesta iti petisionda?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti National Congress ti Brazil**.

The text states the protesters aim to present a petition with 1.2 million signatures *to the National Congress* in November. The question asks where they will present the petition, and the text directly answers that they will present it to the National Congress.
"
"Segun iti inbaga ni Armand Versace, ania ti direkta a napasamak sakbay a nangrugi ti panagtignay ti bunggoy iti paniempo?","The correct answer is **C: Adda dagiti napigsa nga angin (There were strong winds)**.

The passage states: ""Lima minuto pay laeng a nakapakita ket nangrugi ti panagtignay ti bunggoy iti paniempo, maysa minuto kalpasanna, dumanon ti angin iti 70km kada oras."" (Only five minutes had passed when the volcano started erupting, one minute later, the wind reached 70km/h).  The strong wind is the immediate event mentioned *after* the initial eruption.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nangrugin nga uraro (The eruption started):**  While true, the question asks what happened *immediately after* the eruption began and *before* the subsequent events.
*   **B: Lima a minuto ti likudan ti display (Five minutes after the display):** This is a misinterpretation of the sentence. The five minutes refers to the time *before* the eruption intensified.
*   **D: Napukawna ti maysa a kameng ti pamiliana (He awakened a member of his family):**  This is a separate, later event mentioned by Armand Versace, but not the immediate consequence of the volcano erupting.



"
"Segun ken Versace, kaano a nangrugi dagiti kapigsaan nga angin?","The correct answer is **A: Sumagmamano a minuto kalpasan a nangrugi ti display**.

The passage states: ""Lima minuto pay laeng a nakapakita ket nangrugi nga agangin..."" which translates to ""Only five minutes later did the wind begin..."" This directly indicates that the wind started blowing five minutes after the display showed the warning.
"
"Sakbay ni Fred, mano a dadakkel a bagyo ti nairekord iti daya ti 35°W?","The correct answer is **B: Tallo**.

The text states: ""Ni Fred ti kapipigsaan pay laeng a nairekord a tropikal a bagyo iti abagatan ken daya ti Atlantiko sipud pannakaimbento ti satellite imagery, **ken daytoy pay laeng ti maikatlo a kangrunaan a bagyo nga adda iti rekord iti daya ti 35˚W**."" This directly answers the question.
"
"Idi adda ni Fred iti asideg dagiti isla ti Cape Verde, ania a direksion ti pagturonganna?","The correct answer is **A: Laud**.

The question states: ""Ni Fred ket addaan ti angin nga 105 a milia kada oras (165 km/h) ti agdama ken **agturturongon iti amianan a laud**."" which translates to ""Fred has winds of 105 miles per hour (165 km/h) **and is heading northwesterly**."" Therefore, the direction of Fred's movement is northwesterly, which is closest to ""laud"" (west) among the choices provided. While ""northwesterly"" isn't explicitly listed, ""laud"" is the closest representation of the westward component of its movement.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti naparpartak ti kapartak ngem kadagiti immun-una?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Agandar ti 802.11n standard iti agpada a 2.4Ghz ken 5.0Ghz a frequency. Palubosan daytoy a paatras a maibagay iti 802.11a, 802.11b ken 802.11g...""  This means 802.11n is a newer standard that can operate on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies and supports older standards.
* **The question also mentions:** ""...basta la ketdi addaan dua a radio ti base station."" This is a requirement for 802.11n to operate on both frequencies.
* **The question highlights:** ""Adayo a napaspaspas dagiti pegges ti 802.11n ngem kadagiti immun-una iti daytoy nga addaan iti kangatuan a mapattapatta a kapaspas a 600Mbit/s."" This emphasizes that 802.11n is significantly faster than the older standards.

Therefore, 802.11n is the most recent standard mentioned that is faster and backwards compatible with the older options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 802.11b:**  This is an older standard and is *slower* than 802.11n.
* **C: 802.11g:**  This is also an older standard and is *slower* than 802.11n.
* **D: 802.11a:** This is an older standard, operates on the 5 GHz frequency (while 802.11n can use 5 GHz), and is *slower* than 802.11n.
"
Ania ti kasapulan tapno ti 802.11n ket Palubosan daytoy a paatras iti 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **A: Nakapatpateg a naparpartak ti kapartak (Backward compatibility)**.

Here's why:

* **Backward compatibility** is the key to 802.11n supporting older standards like 802.11b.  802.11n is designed to be able to communicate with devices that use older Wi-Fi standards.  This means the 802.11n access point needs to be able to understand and work with the older protocols.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti abilidad para iti 802.11b nga ag-operate iti 5.0Ghz:**  802.11b operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency. There's no need for it to operate on 5 GHz for backward compatibility.
* **C: Ti throughput a 600Mbit/s:** While 600 Mbit/s is a characteristic of 802.11n, it's not a requirement for backward compatibility.  802.11n *can* achieve that speed, but it doesn't need to in order to work with older standards.
* **D: Doble a radio:**  While a dual-radio base station *helps* 802.11n achieve its full potential, it's not *required* for backward compatibility. A single-radio 802.11n base station can still support older standards.



Therefore, the fundamental requirement for 802.11n to support 802.11b is backward compatibility.



"
Mano a pasamak ti paglanguyan ti nakaala iti balitok a medalia iti Commonwealth Games?,"The correct answer is **B: Tallo**.

The passage states the athlete swam in **three** relays at the Commonwealth Games.
"
Apay a saan nga agtomtomar ti nakaala iti balitok a medalia iti Olympics iti agas para iti ut-otna?,"The correct answer is **C: Madanagan a negatibo ti epektona iti kinasalun-atna (Significant negative effects on his health)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states he ""saanna a nabalinan a natomar dagiti agas a masapulna tapno madaeranna ti ut-otna gapu ta maiparit dagitoy iti Games"" (was unable to endure the training needed to recover his health due to these Games). This directly implies the training negatively impacted his health.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Awan ti ut-otna (He has no health issues)** - The passage clearly indicates he *does* have health issues related to his swimming.
* **B: Pinagsakitna ti riknana (He injured his kidney)** - While possible, the passage doesn't specify a kidney injury. It's a broader statement about negative effects on his health.
* **D: Saan a maipalubos dayta iti Commonwealth Games (He couldn't express it at the Commonwealth Games)** - This is irrelevant to the reason he couldn't train and recover. The problem is the impact on his health, not his ability to communicate about it at the games.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a nangiturong iti pannakariro maipapan iti aktibidad ti gingined?","The correct answer is **A: Ti kaadda dagiti nasipnget nga ulep**.

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Dagiti ulap ket nangited iti posible a panagriribuk no adda talaga ti napasamak a panagputok iti bulkan."" (The clouds provided a possible indication if an eruption had really occurred.) The dark clouds are the specific observation leading to the possibility of an eruption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti padamag manipud iti Meteorolohikal nga Opisina ti Icelandic:**  The meteorogical office report *stated* no activity, which contradicts the possibility of an eruption.
* **C: Ti mapa iti gingined iti lubong:** While the world seismic map is mentioned, it's used to show where seismic activity *wasn't* observed in Iceland.  It doesn't *point* to the possibility of an eruption.
* **D: Aktibidad a naireport iti dadduma a lugar ti Iceland:** The text focuses on activity near Hekla. Reports from other locations don't directly indicate activity at the specific location of the reported clouds.



"
"Segun iti paset, kaano a napasamak ti panagbalbaliw ti paset?","The correct answer is **B: Iti napalabas nga 48 nga oras**.

The text states: ""Ang pangunahing aktibidad ng pagsabog na nagresulta sa pagbabago ng saad ay naganap noong Marso 10 **sa loob ng mga sumunod na 48 oras.**"" (The main eruptive activity that resulted in the change in the forecast occurred on March 10 **within the following 48 hours.**) This clearly indicates the change happened within the 48 hours following March 10th.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan iti Chandrayaan-1’s lunar probe ti saan a pudno?,"The correct answer is **A: Adda tripulante ti orbiter a nangilansa iti probe** (The orbiter that launched the probe had a crew).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the probe was a ""Moon Impact Probe"" (MIP). Impact probes are *unmanned* – they are designed to crash into a celestial body.
* The passage mentions the probe carried scientific instruments and the Indian flag. This is consistent with the purpose of an unmanned probe.
* Options B and C are correct statements from the passage. 
* Option D is also correct, the probe had a painted flag. 
* Therefore, the only incorrect statement is option A, because the probe was unmanned.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti siuumiso a mangiladawan iti lunar probe?,"The correct answer is **B: Naballigi ti crash landing-na**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) **""simmiwet iti rabaw ti Bulan iti 1.5 kilometro kada segundo (3000 a milia kada oras)""** which means it crashed into the Moon.
* It also says the probe **""sibaballigi a bimmaba iti asideg ti south pole ti Bulan""**, indicating a crash landing, not a successful landing.
* Option A is incorrect because the probe landed near the south pole, not the north pole.
* Options C and D are incorrect because the passage doesn't mention a crewed orbiter or two scientific instruments.

Therefore, the only correct statement based on the provided text is that the lunar probe experienced a crash landing.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a wagas ti proteksion kontra iti sakit ti maudi a maipatungpal?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti bakuna nga encephalitis**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sumagmamano a milion a botelia ti bakuna nga encephalitis ti inkari pay ti gobierno, a mangntulong a mangisagana kadagiti ahensia ti salun-at para iti sumaruno a tawen.""  (Millions of bottles of encephalitis vaccines have been procured by the government, which will help strengthen health agencies for the next year.)

While the text mentions other preventative measures like moving pigs and using mosquito nets/pesticides, it specifically highlights the vaccines as a crucial protective measure being implemented.
"
Kasano a mayakar ti sakit kadagiti tattao?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti lamok (Mosquitoes)**.

The text states: ""Adda ti sakit kadagiti baboy, nga umakar kadagiti tao babaen dagiti lamok."" (There is a disease in pigs that spreads to humans through mosquitoes.)

Therefore, mosquitoes are the vectors that transmit the disease to humans.
"
Ti pannakapaay ti maikadua a sentensia ket mabalin nga agtungpal iti ania a pagbanagan?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa a masanguanan a kalintegan kadagiti sibil a panagtipon ti agpada a sekso.**

Here's why:

The text states that the second sentence of the resolution, which addresses the civil unions of the same sex, *could* open the door for future civil unions for the same-sex community.  This implies a potential for increased legal recognition and rights for same-sex couples.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti dagus a panangrepaso iti HJR-3:** While the text mentions a possible review of HJR-3, the *impact* of the second sentence is centered on its potential for broader legal implications.  A quick review is a *process*, not a *result* of the second sentence.
* **C: Maysa nga emerhensia a lehislatibo a sesion:** The text doesn't mention an emergency legislative session.
* **D: Ti pannakaiparit dagiti sibil a panagtipon ti agpada a sekso:**  While the second sentence *addresses* civil unions, the potential impact is on *future* civil unions for the same-sex community, not the immediate legalization of existing ones (which would be the outcome of the first sentence).

Therefore, option B best captures the potential consequence described in the text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a naikkat ti maikadua a sentensia?","The correct answer is **C: Inton Lunes**.

The passage states: ""Sa maikadua a sentensia, a mangisingsingasing iti pannakaiparit ti sibil a panagtipon dagiti agpada ti seksona, ket mabalin a luktanna ti ruangan para kadagiti sibil a panagtipon iti masakbayan. No suroten ti proseso, ti HJR-3 ket repasuento manen ti sumaruno a nabutosan a lehislatura a nalabit inton 2015 wenno 2016 tapno agtultuloy ti proseso.""  This implies the second sentence was acted upon *last Monday* (Lunes).  While 2011 is mentioned as the year of the initial amendment, the second sentence's action happened more recently - last Monday. The other options are incorrect as they don't directly reflect the timing of the second sentence.
"
Siasino ti nakairuaran dagiti “Panama Papers”?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti opisina ti abogado a Mossack Fonseca**.

The text explicitly states that the ""Panama Papers"" were leaked from the office of the law firm Mossack Fonseca. While the Guardian published the information, the source of the documents was Mossack Fonseca.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti imbaga ti pagiwarnak a Briton a mangimatmaton iti adu kadagiti kompania a maus-usar a mangilemmeng iti kinabaknang?","The correct answer is **C: Bangko iti Deutsche**.

The text states: ""Adda dagiti protesta iti sangalubongan, sumagmamano a pannakausig kadagiti kriminal, ken agpada a nagikkat dagiti daulo ti gobierno ti Iceland ken Pakistan. **Imasimudaag ti pagiwarnak a Briton a The Guardian a kontrolado ti Deutsche Bank ti agarup kakatlo ti 1200 a shell company a nausar tapno maaramid daytoy.**"" 

This clearly indicates that the British newspaper The Guardian reported that Deutsche Bank controlled a large number of shell companies used for tax evasion.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad nga aksidente eroplano ti kaaduan ti natay?,"The correct answer is **A: Pannakatnag ti eroplano bayat ti panagturongna idiay Armenia manipud Iran**.

Here's why:

* The question asks which accident resulted in the most deaths.
* The passage states the plane crash in Armenia killed 168 people.
* The other options involve fewer fatalities (3 in the police helicopter crash, 17 in the Mashhad plane crash).

Therefore, the Armenia plane crash is the accident with the highest death toll."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a makaigapu iti nakaad-adu nga aksidente iti eroplano a mapaspasamak idiay Iran?,"The best answer is **D: Saan a nasayaat ti pannakamantenerna a bunggoy dagiti eroplano (Poor maintenance of aircraft)**.

Here's why:

* The prompt explicitly states that a key problem contributing to the accidents is the *poor maintenance* of the aircraft, affecting both civilian and military operations. This is a direct cause mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ti daan nga armada dagiti sibil ken militar nga eroplano (The outdated fleet of civilian and military aircraft):** While the text mentions an outdated fleet, it's *combined* with the poor maintenance as a major factor. The problem isn't just having old planes; it's having old planes that aren't maintained properly.
* **B: Ti kinakurang ti badyet a mangipalubos iti panaggatang kadagiti baro nga eroplano (Budget constraints limiting spending on new aircraft):** The text doesn't directly mention budget constraints. While this could be a contributing factor, it's not highlighted as a primary cause.
* **C: Dagiti sanction a manglapped iti panaggatang kadagiti baro nga eroplano (Sanctions limiting spending on new aircraft):** Similar to budget constraints, sanctions aren't explicitly mentioned as a direct cause in the text.



Therefore, **D** is the most directly supported answer by the provided information.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a karaman ti padamag gapu ti Grupo ti Panagadal ti Iraq?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa a deklarasion a babaen ti sumagmamano a panagbalbaliw, maliklikan ti dumakdakkel a kinaranggas idiay Iraq.**

Here's why:

The report emphasizes the need for a new diplomatic initiative to secure Iraq's borders *and* restore diplomatic relations. While the report *discusses* the US's lack of consensus and the potential for increased violence (mentioned in the introductory paragraph), it doesn't present a *declaration* that increasing violence is a desired outcome due to policy changes. The report aims to *prevent* increased violence.

Here's why the other options *are* covered:

*   **A: Panangdillaw ti agdama a polisiya (Criticism of the current policy):** The report is *critical* of the current Executive branch's policies regarding Iraq and suggests a significant shift in direction.
*   **C: Rekomendasion tapno masigurado dagiti border ti Iraq (Recommendations to secure Iraq's borders):** The report explicitly recommends a new diplomatic initiative to secure Iraq's borders.
*   **D: Ti pangaasi iti concensus ti US (The lack of US consensus):**  The report addresses the US's inability to reach consensus and how this impacts the situation.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a ginuyogoy ti Grupo ti Panagadal ti Iraq ti reportna?,"The correct answer is **A: A makasigurado a ti pannakaisardeng ti panagraira ti kinabayolente ket maipakdaar.**

Here's why:

The question asks what *wasn't* emphasized in the report. The report *does* emphasize the uncertainty of whether any action in Iraq will prevent violence, escalate conflict, or lead to humanitarian crises. Options B, C, and D are all explicitly mentioned as key components of the report. Option A, the certainty of preventing violence, is directly contradicted by the report's emphasis on uncertainty.

Therefore, A is the only option that accurately reflects something *not* emphasized.
"
"Segun iti pulis, asinno ti maikonsiderar a makinkannawan nga ima ti Povenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text states: ""ni Lo Piccolo ket adda ti nangatngato nga imana ta isuna ti makinkannawan nga ima ti Povezano..."" which translates to ""Lo Piccolo had a significant role because he was considered the image of Povezano...""
"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, ania ti gapu ti pannakapatay ni Falcone?","The correct answer is **D: Napatay isuna ti padana a krusado ti Mafia a ni Paolo Borsellino**.

The text states: ""Niriendaan ni Provenzano dagitoy nga amo idi ginibusanna ti gubat nga iturturong ni Riina a kontra iti estado a nakatayan dagiti kontra iti Mafia a da Giovanni Falcone ken Paolo Borsellino idi 1992."" This translates to: ""Provenzano condemned these [actions] when he ended the war directed by Riina against the state that had fought against the Mafia, namely Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.""

Therefore, Falcone was killed as part of the Mafia's war against the state, which Provenzano was involved in. While the text mentions Riina directing the war, it directly links Falcone's death to the Mafia's broader conflict with the state.  Option D accurately reflects this.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a pammadayaw ni Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **C: Mamindua a medalista ti balitok ti Olympic**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti gapu ti pannakatayna ket naipakaammo a kanser iti intrahepatic bile duct. Natay isuna idiay Osaka idi Martes. Kasta pay ti panangbalinna a dati a kampeon ti Olympic ken Lubong..."" This confirms he was a two-time Olympic medalist.

While he was a two-time world champion (A) and headed the Judo Federation training committee (B), the question asks which is *not* mentioned. And the text *does* mention him as a two-time Olympic medalist.  ""Eksperto ti judo"" (D) is a general statement, and while likely true, the text doesn't specifically call him an expert.
"
Sadinno a naliklikan ni Iwasaki ti panagaramidna dagiti kari?,"The correct answer is **A: Japan**.

The first sentence states that Iwasaki encountered problems *during* his travels. The question asks where he *started* his travels. The text doesn't explicitly state where he started, but it's implied that his travels began in Japan, since it's his origin and the context for discussing his adventures.

Therefore, Japan is the most logical answer.
"
Asinno ti nagraut kenni Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti pirata**.

The text explicitly states that Iwasaki was attacked by pirates.
"
Kaano nga insardeng ni Alonso ti pakilumbana?,"The correct answer is **B: Naawanan ni Fisichella iti kontrol iti luganna**.

The text states: ""Naawanan ni Giancarlo Fisichella iti kontrol iti luganna isu a nasapa a nagsardeng a nakilumba iti pay la rugrugina."" (Giancarlo Fisichella lost control of his car and was forced to retire early.)

Option B directly reflects this statement. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kalpasan ti pannakadadael ni Schumacher ti kannawan a makinsango a pilidna** - While Schumacher also retired, Alonso's retirement isn't directly linked to Schumacher's issue.
*   **C: Kalpasan ti panagsardeng ni Schumacher ti pakilumbana** - This is incorrect; Schumacher retired *before* Alonso.
*   **D: Sakbay ti pangidaulo** - The text doesn't mention Alonso retiring while leading. He retired after losing control."
Ania ti gapo ti nasapa a pagsardeng ni Schumacher ti pakikarerana iti pay la rugrugina?,"The correct answer is **D: Pannakadadael ti suspension ti lugan (Damage to the suspension)**.

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher ti pannakilumbana saan a nabayag kalpasan ni Alonso, gapu iti pannakadadael ti suspension iti adu a laban iti kabayatan ti lumba."" (Michael Schumacher's racing didn't continue much after Alonso, due to damage to the suspension in many of the races.)

While Giancarlo Fisichella's spinning caused a crash, and Alonso also experienced problems, the text directly links Schumacher's retirement to suspension damage.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti trabaho ti panangisaad ti piansa kadagiti naaresto?","The correct answer is **D: Ti komisioner ti korte**.

The text states: ""Iti komisioner iti piansa, no maited, ken maipormal dagiti darum nga impila ti opisial a nagaresto."" This translates to ""The commissioner will set bail, if granted, and formalize the charges against the officer who arrested them."" Therefore, the commissioner of the court is responsible for setting bail.
"
"Segun iti temporary restraining order a nadakamat iti mabasa, ania ti masapul a mapalubosan nga adda kadagiti naaresto tapno napapaut ngem 24 nga oras ti pannakaibaludda?","The correct answer is **A: Piansa**.

The text states: ""The commissioner will set bail, if any, for the arrested individuals..."" This directly indicates that bail is required for release within 24 hours. The other options are not mentioned as requirements in the text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a rason ti saan a nausar tapno maipalawag ti naikansela a runoff?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti peggad iti seguridad (Security concerns)**.

The text explicitly states that Lodin claimed the election runoff was canceled to allow Afghans to focus on security. The diplomats also cited differing interpretations of the constitution to justify not holding a repeat election, implying a security-related justification.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maysa a kontradiksion iti konstitusion (A contradiction in the constitution):** The text says diplomats cited *differing interpretations*, not a direct contradiction.
* **C: Nangina a gastos (High costs):**  The text doesn't mention cost as a reason.
* **D: Saan unay a nalawag iti konstitusion (Not clearly defined in the constitution):** While there are differing interpretations, the *reason* for the cancellation was related to security, not just ambiguity in the constitution.



"
Apay a naikeddeng dagiti diplomatiko a saanen a kasapulan ti runoff iti kamaudiananna?,"The correct answer is **C: Adda ti saan unay a nalawag iti konstitusion**

Here's why:

The passage states that diplomats ""advocated for a different interpretation of the Afghan constitution to avoid the need for repeated elections."" This implies the constitution wasn't clear on whether a runoff election was necessary, allowing for a different interpretation to be applied.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Nasalungasingna ti konstitusion (The constitution is ambiguous):** This is close, but ""saan unay a nalawag"" (not very clear) is more directly stated in the text.
*   **B: Adda dagiti peggad iti seguridad (There are security concerns):** While security was *part* of the reason for the cancellation, the primary justification for avoiding a runoff was the constitutional interpretation.
*   **D: Nagastos unay ti eleksion (The election was too expensive):** The passage does not mention cost as a factor.

Therefore, option C best reflects the reason given in the text.
"
Siasino ti mangipapaay kadagiti serbisio ti hues para ti FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti Ahente ti Politika**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dagitoys nga ahente ti responsable para iti pannakaipaay kadagiti serbisio ti gobierno ken hudikatura iti babaen ti Artikulo 247 ti Konstitusion ti Pakistan."" This directly links the Political Agents to the responsibility of providing judicial services in FATA.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti “Dagiti Ahente ti Politika” iti FATA ti saan nga agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **B: Napilida ti presidente ti Pakistan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Manipud pay idi independensa ti Pakistan ti panagturay iti Britania idi 1947, ti Presidente iti Pakistan intudingna dagiti “Ahente Politikal” a mangturay iti FATA..."" This indicates the agents were appointed by the President.
* **The question asks:** Which of the following statements is *not* true about the ""Political Agents"" in FATA?
* **Let's analyze each option:**
    * **A: Mangipapaayda kadagiti serbisio ti hues (Providing judicial services):** The passage explicitly states they are responsible for providing judicial services under Article 247.
    * **B: Napilida ti presidente ti Pakistan (Appointed by the President):** The passage *states* that the President appoints the agents. Therefore, this statement is **not** something they *don't* do.
    * **C: Sursurutenda ti konstitusion ti Pakistan (Operate under the Constitution of Pakistan):** The passage mentions that they are responsible for providing services under Article 247 of the Constitution. This implies they operate within the framework of the Constitution.
    * **D: Adda ti sibubukel a kontrolda kadagiti partikular a lugar (Have complete control over specific areas):** The passage describes them as managing FATA and providing services, suggesting a level of administration, but doesn't indicate complete control.  It implies *autonomous* governance, not absolute control.

**Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage.**



"
Ania a gunggona ti nakainominaran ni Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Kalaingan nga Artista**.

The question states: ""Nakaawat da Gosling ken Stone iti nominasion para iti Kalalaingan nga Aktor ken Aktres, kas panagsaganadda."" This translates to ""Gosling and Stone received nominations for Best Actor and Best Actress, respectively.""  ""Best Actress"" is ""Kalaingan nga Aktres"" in Filipino, and ""Best Actor"" is ""Kalaingan nga Aktor"".  Therefore, Emma Stone was nominated for Best Actress, which is ""Kalaingan nga Artista"".
"
Ania a gunggona ti saan nga nakainominaran ti pelikula?,"The correct answer is **B: Kapintasan kadagiti Visual Effect**.

The text explicitly lists the following nominations:

*   Kapintasan a Pelikula (Featured Film)
*   Kalaingan a Aktor (Best Actor) - Ryan Gosling
*   Kalaingan a Aktres (Best Actress) - Emma Stone
*   Kalaingan a Direktor (Best Director)
*   Kalaingan a Cinematography (Best Cinematography)
*   Disenio ti Kawes (Best Art Direction)
*   Panagedit iti Pelikula (Best Film Editing)

*   Orihinal nga Screenplay (Best Original Screenplay)
*   Kapintasan nga Orihinal a Kanta (Best Original Song) - Audition (The Fools Who Dream) & City of Stars

""Kapintasan kadagiti Visual Effect"" is not mentioned in the provided nominations. Therefore, it's the answer to the question."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nagtalinaed iti operasion kalpasan ti gingined?,"The correct answer is **A: Amin a reactor iti planta ti Hokuriku Shika**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inreport pay ti NHK a normal ti operasion ti nuklear a planta ti elektrisidad iti Kashiwazaki Kariwa idiay prepektura ti Niigata. Kinuna iti Hokuriku Electric Power Co. nga awan iti epekto ti gingined ken ti Numero 1 ken 2 a reactor idiay planta ti nuclear power ti Shika ket naiddep pay laeng.""

This translates to: ""NHK reported that normal operation is being reported at the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture. The Hokuriku Electric Power Co. plant's Unit 1 and 2 reactors were still offline due to the earthquake.""

The question asks what normalized *after* the earthquake. While several things were disrupted (water supply, power, roads, train service, airport closure), the passage specifically mentions the status of the Hokuriku Shika plant reactors. The passage indicates Unit 1 and 2 were offline, implying the remaining reactors *were* operating normally. Therefore, the normalization of **all reactors in the Hokuriku Shika plant** is the most accurate answer based on the provided information.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ti airport iti Ishikawa:** The passage states the airport was *closed*, not that it was normalized.
*   **C: Amin a serbisio ti tren:** The passage indicates train service was *disrupted*, not normalized.
*   **D: Maysa a planta ti elektrisidad iti Niigata:** The passage focuses on the Hokuriku Shika plant, not other plants in Niigata.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nadadael gapu ti gingined?","The correct answer is **C: Sumagmamano a kalsada**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sumagmamano a kalsada ti nadadael..."" which translates to ""Several roads were damaged...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sumagmamano a balay (Several houses):** While 9400 houses were without water, the text doesn't say they were *damaged*.
* **B: Dua a reactor iti planta ti Shika (Two reactors at the Shika plant):** The text says the reactors at the Shika plant were *not* affected.
* **D: Ti Noto Airport (The Noto Airport):** The airport was *closed*, not necessarily damaged.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a parikut ti saan a nairaman iti dokumento?","The correct answer is **B: Ti gapu ti gubat idi 1967**.

Here's why:

The document explicitly states that it's about the territorial borders the Palestinians want based on the 1967 Middle East War. Therefore, the *reason* for the borders (the 1967 war) is *included* in the document's scope.

The document *does* discuss:

*   **The borders themselves:** The core topic.
*   **Jerusalem:** Its status as a holy city is mentioned.
*   **The West Bank:** The issue of Israeli military presence and the PA's eventual control of it are discussed.

Therefore, the only option *not* covered in the document, according to the text, is the **reason** (the 1967 war) for the territorial disputes.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a dawat ti Palestina?,"The correct answer is **B: Agdama a kaadda dagiti militar iti Jordan Valley**.

Here's why:

* The document states the document is about the territorial bases the Palestinians want based on the 1967 war.
* It mentions the issue of Israeli military occupation of the Jordan Valley after the 1967 war, specifically noting that Israel continued its presence for ten years *after* an agreement was made for a five-year Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley with the PA.
* This implies the Palestinians *do not* want a continued Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley beyond the agreed-upon timeframe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti nagbeddengan a base kadagiti kondision sakbay ti gubat** - The document *does* discuss the territorial bases from the time of the war. This is a topic *addressed* in the document.
* **C: Dagiti sungbat a maipapan ti masakbayan ti Jerusalem** - The document *does* mention the issue of Jerusalem and its religious significance.  This is another topic *addressed* in the document.
* **D: Ti kaddaa ti militar iti lima a tawen iti Jordan Valley** -  The document states there was an agreement for a five-year Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley, but it also details that Israel stayed longer than that. This isn't something the Palestinians *don't* want, but rather something the agreement didn't fully achieve, or was later superseded.



"
Ania a pagilian ti nagadalan ni Ma ti kalintegan?,"The correct answer is **A: Estados Unidos ti Amerika**.

The text states that Ma ""nagadal ni Ma iti New York University ken Harvard Law School,"" which are both located in the United States.  The text also mentions he has a ""green card"" as a permanent resident of the US. Therefore, he studied and is a permanent resident of the United States.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti panangsuporta para ti ania a pagilian ti nangabakan ni Ma iti eleksion?","The correct answer is **A: Estados Unidos ti Amerika**.

The passage states: ""linaklaka ni Ma ti nangabak iti plataporma a mangiganggannuat iti nadekdekket a pannakikadua iti Mainland China.""  This implies he was campaigning *in* the United States, focusing on issues related to China.
"
"Kas naisaad iti mabasa, siasino ti nagtrabahuan ni Carolyn Wilson sakbay a pimmanaw isuna iti ili?","The correct answer is **C: Ti OHA**.

This clearly indicates Carolyn Wilson worked for the OHA.
"
"Manipud ti uppat a karera a nagtalinaed iti season, siasino ti maika-uppat iti Driver’s Championship?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""Ti maikatlo, ni Hamlin ket maat-atiw iti duapulo a puntos, ngem mangabngabak ti lima kenni Bowyer.""  This means Bowyer is ahead of Hamlin.  The options list Bowyer as a contender for the top 10.
"
"Kas kasaruno ti karera a naisaad iti mabasa, mano ti puntos ni Kahne iti Driver’s Championship?","The correct answer is **D: 2207**.

The passage states: ""Kahne ken Truex, Jr. ket maikalima ken maikainnem nga addaan ti 2,200 ken 2,207 a puntos.""  Therefore, Kahne's points are 2200. However, the provided answer choices do not include 2200. It seems there might be a slight discrepancy.  The closest answer is D, 2207, which is listed for Truex, Jr. but Kahne has 2200 points. Assuming there's a typo in the options and D is meant to be 2200 (or closest available to it) then the answer is D.

"Segun iti mabasa, mano a daras a nasaksian dagiti tattao ti panagtinnag dagiti meteorite a nangpaneknek a manipud daytoy iti Mars?","The correct answer is **C: Sangapulo ket lima a daras**.

The passage states: ""Sangapulo-ket-lima kadagitoy a bato ket maibaga a naggapu iti panagtinnag dagiti layap idi Hulio."" This translates to ""Fifteen of these rocks are said to have come from the impact of meteorites in July.""
"
"Kas naisaad iti mabasa, ania ti agpaypayso maipapan kadagiti bato a naammuan a manipud iti Mars?","The correct answer is **A: Nasarakan amin dagitoy bayat ti panagtudo ti meteor idi Hulio**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sangapulo-ket-lima kadagitoy a bato ket maibaga a naggapu iti panagtinnag dagiti layap idi Hulio."" This directly translates to ""Fifteen of these rocks are said to have come from meteorites that landed in July.""

Option A accurately reflects this information. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 24,000 dagitoy:** This refers to the total number of meteorites found in the Sea, not the specific rocks from Mars.
*   **C: Nanginnginada ti $11,000 ngem ti balitok:** This describes the price range of the rocks, not their origin.
*   **D: 34 dagitoy:** This is the number of confirmed Martian rocks, but it doesn't specify when they were found.



"
Kaano a nagretiro ni Schumacher?,"The correct answer is **B: Kalpasan ti maikapito a pangabakna iti kampeonato**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ni Schumacher a nagretiro idi 2006 kalpasanna nangabak iti kampeonato iti Formula 1 iti maminpito nga ulit..."" which translates to ""Schumacher retired in 2006 after winning the Formula 1 championship seven times...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kalpasan ti pannakaidungpar ni Felipe Massa:** While Felipe Massa's injury *influenced* the situation and potentially *contributed* to Schumacher's retirement, the passage doesn't state that Schumacher retired *because* of Massa's injury. It simply mentions the injury as a factor.
*   **C: Kalpasan a sinukatanna ni Felipe Massa:**  The passage doesn't mention Schumacher measuring or competing with Felipe Massa.
*   **D: Iti gibus ti 2009 a season:** The passage states Schumacher retired in 2006."
Kaano a nadunor ni Massa?,"The correct answer is **B: Kalpasan a nangabak isuna iti kampeonato ti Formula 1**.

The passage states: ""Nagsagaba ti Brazilian iti nakaro a pannakadunor ti ulona kalpasan ti maysa a crash kabayatan ti Hungarian Grand Prix idi 2009.""  This directly links Massa's injuries to the time *after* Schumacher retired and Massa missed out on the championship. While the crash happened in 2009, the injuries and subsequent impact were related to the championship situation.

"Segun iti mabasa, kasanonto a maapektaran ti pannakaiyurnos iti AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Ti bilang dagiti mangus-usar ti AOL ket maisuppiatto kadagiti mangus-usar ti Yahoo ken Microsoft.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that AOL's decline is due to the rise of other IM services, specifically mentioning Yahoo! and Microsoft as competitors.
* It also highlights that the number of users on Yahoo! and Microsoft is comparable to AOL's customer base.
* Therefore, the user base is being ""eaten up"" (maisuppiatto) by the competition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti bilang dagiti mangus-usar ti AOL ket umadunto** - This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **B: Ti AOL laeng ti kompania a nasukog iti merkado ti IM** - The passage implies that AOL isn't the only company facing this issue; it's a broader trend.
* **D: Saanto a mausar ti AOL iti Estados Unidos** - While the passage mentions AOL's decline in the US, it doesn't say that it's no longer used there. It's about the *decrease* in usage.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mabalin a mangleppas iti baro a napagtulagan?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti nawaras a panagdur-as ti internet iti Estados Unidos**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what could help AOL overcome the new competition.** The passage states AOL is facing competition due to declining use in the US.
* **Option A directly addresses the reason for AOL's decline.**  A waning internet market in the US reduces the overall potential customer base for AOL's services. If fewer people are online, fewer people will use AOL's products.
* **The other options are factors contributing to the *competition*, not a solution for AOL:**
    * **B: Ti panagusar ti merkado ti IM:**  The popularity of other IM services is *causing* the competition, not a factor AOL can overcome *with* a new strategy.
    * **C: Ti kinawaya ti AOL a mangsukog ti merkado iti bukodna a panagaddang:** This describes AOL's strategy, but not what helps it overcome the competition.
    * **D: Panagkadua iti Yahoo ken Microsoft:**  Yahoo and Microsoft *are* the competition.  AOL needs a way to compete *with* them, not overcome their existence by changing the market itself.



"
Mano a tao ti natay iti panangraut a saan a pulis?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

The passage states: ""Imbaga ti opisina ti gobernador a sangapulo ket siyam kadagiti nadangran ket opisial ti polis."" (The governor's office reported that ninety-nine of those injured were police officers.) It also says ""pagtaengan ti pulisia"" (police station). This implies that the victims were all police officers, and no civilians were killed in the attack. The question asks about non-police victims.
"
Siasino ti nangipadamag iti suspek ti panangraut?,"The correct answer is **A: Pulis (Police)**.

The text states: ""Dagiti polis a pagsuspetsaanda ti maysa a napabasol a militante a Daesh (ISIL) a responsable iti atake."" This translates to ""The police suspect a convicted Daesh (ISIL) militant is responsible for the attack.""  Therefore, the police are investigating and suspecting the individual.
"
"Gapu ti kasasaad ti Florida kas maysa a winner-takes-all nga estado, ania ti naigunggona ken ni Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Amin a delegado ti estado**.

Here's why:

* **Winner-take-all system:** Florida uses a winner-take-all system. This means the candidate who wins the most votes in the state receives *all* of that state's electoral delegates.
* **The passage states:** ""...inted ti Florida iti amin a limapulo a delegadona kenni Romney..."" (Florida gave all 50 of its delegates to Romney...)

Therefore, Romney received all 50 of Florida's delegates. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 32 kadagiti delegado ti estado:** This is incorrect because Romney received all 50.
* **B: Ti nominasion ti Republican a Partido:** While this is a potential outcome of winning Florida, the question asks what Romney *immediately* gained due to the winner-take-all system.
* **D: 46 porsiento ti butos:** While Romney won 46% of the vote, the key outcome due to the winner-take-all system is the allocation of *all* the delegates.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti porsiento ti butos para ken ni Gingrich iti immuna nga eleksion?","The correct answer is **B: 32 porsiento**.

The text states: ""Diay dati nga U. S Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich ket maikadua nga addaan iti 32 porsiento."" (Former U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich had the second-highest with 32 percent.)
"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti saan a nagtuloy a timmaray kalpasan dagiti resulta ti panagtataripnong?","The correct answer is **C: Ni Perry**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ni Perry nga isuna ket “agsubli idiay Texas tapno amirisen dagiti resulta ti panagtataripnong ita a rabii, ken kitaen no adda a talaga dalanko nga agtuloy para iti daytoy a laban”..."" This indicates that Perry was considering dropping out of the race, but didn't definitively announce it *at that moment*. However, the passage then says: ""...nga agtalinaed isuna iti laban ket makisalisal iti primaria ti South Carolina inton Enero 21."" This implies he was still participating, but with a strong indication of leaving.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ni Bachman, a nangabak iti Ames Straw Poll, inkeddengna a palpasenna ti kampaniana."" (Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll, announced the end of her campaign.)

The passage does not say that Gingrich or Romney dropped out. 

Therefore, Perry is the one who is most clearly indicating he will be leaving the race after Iowa.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti nangdayaw ti sabali a kandidato kalpasan ti resulta ti caucus?","The correct answer is **B: Ni Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Kalpasan a rimuar dagiti resulta, dinayaw ni Gingrich ni Santorum..."" which translates to ""After the results were tallied, Gingrich praised Santorum...""
"
Sadinno ti kakaisuna a lugar a nai-feature ti pabuya sakbay ti 2015?,"The correct answer is **B: East Texas**.

Here's why:

The question asks where the show *originally* featured actors from before 2015. The text states: ""...dagiti agdadamo nga aktor ti boses, lokal a taga Makindaya ti Texas.""  This indicates the actors were from East Texas.

While TogiNet Radio and AstroNet Radio are mentioned, they are the *stations* broadcasting the show, not the location of the actors.  The show featured actors *from* East Texas.
"
Ti istasion ket mangilad-ladawan ti pabuya kas ania a tipo ti spin?,"The correct answer is **D: Lokal**.

Here's why:

* The description emphasizes the station's focus on ""local Makindaya of Texas"" voice actors. This directly points to a local angle.
* The description mentions it as a ""small, new, and informal radio theater"" which suggests a community-based, less mainstream feel, further supporting the ""local"" classification.

The other options don't fit as well:

* **Amateur:** While potentially having amateur elements, the description doesn't explicitly highlight amateurism as a primary characteristic.
* **Geeky:** The description isn't particularly focused on a niche or nerdy interest.
* **Old school:** While the ""radio theater"" format has a vintage feel, the description also emphasizes ""new"" and ""informal,"" making ""old school"" less accurate than ""local.""



"
Ania ti natipun ni David Headley a nakatulong ti panangraut ti militante a grupo iti kamaudiananna?,"The correct answer is **A: Impormasion**.

The passage states: ""Nakatulong ken David Headley ti panagalana ken panagsawarna kadagiti impormasion tapno maiyusuat iti operasion..."" which translates to ""David Headley helped by gathering and disseminating information to execute the operation..."" 

Therefore, David Headley provided **information** that aided the militants.
"
Ania a klase ti transportasion ti inusar ti militante a grupo tapno makabiahe paapan iti Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Bangka**. 

The text states: ""Idi Nobiembre 26, 2008, dimteng dagiti nangraut iti Mumbai babaen ti **bangka** nga adda dagiti awitda a granada..."" (On November 26, 2008, terrorists attacked Mumbai by **boat** carrying grenades...).
"
Ania a keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw ti nagbanagan ti Silulukat a laban ti Nadal ken Raonic Brisbane a naisaad iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **C: Naabak ti Nadal iti Raonic**.

The text states: ""Saan pay a nabayag idi naabak isuna kontra ken ni Raonic iti Brisbane Open."" This translates to ""It was not mentioned that he was defeated against Raonic at the Brisbane Open.""  The subsequent sentences describe Nadal's performance *during* that match, implying he was the one who lost.  The quote from the ""King of Tennis"" refers to the match *after* the loss.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naabak ti Raonic iti Nadal** - This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **B: Addaan ti 88% a puntos ti net iti Raonic** - The text states Nadal had 88% net points, not Raonic.
* **D: Nakapuntos ti Raonic ti 76 a puntos** - The text states Nadal had 76 points on his first serve, not Raonic.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti agdama a laban ti Nadal ken Raonic kalpasan ti umuna a serve?","The correct answer is **B: Nangabak ti Nadal ti 76 a puntos**.

The text states: ""Nadal naala ti 88% a puntos iti ay-ayam a nangabakanna ti 76 a puntos ti umuna a panag-serve."" This translates to ""Nadal won 88% of the points in the games he won, with 76 points won on his first serve.""
"
Ania a programa ti pagsasao ti saan a nairaman iti tallo a baro a pagiwarnakan ti Naked News?,"The correct answer is **C: Hapon (Japanese)**.

Here's why:

The question states that the Naked News will report in English, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, and Korean. The options provided are:

*   **A: Italiano (Italian)** - Listed as a language they will report in.
*   **B: Koreano (Korean)** - Listed as a language they will report in.
*   **C: Hapon (Japanese)** - Listed as a language they will report in.
*   **D: Espaniol (Spanish)** - Listed as a language they will report in.

The question asks which language is *not* included. Therefore, none of the options are the correct answer. I apologize. However, I realize that there may be a typo in your answer options.

If the options included ""Hindi"", then the correct answer would be **Hindi**, as it is not mentioned in the original text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno a saan a sidadaan ti baro a pagiwarnakan ti Naked News?","The correct answer is **C: Kadagiti teatro**.

The passage states the new broadcasts will be available on television, web, and mobile devices. It does **not** mention theaters.

Mano ti saan a nakalpas ti Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The question asks about the number of skiers who didn't finish the Giant Slalom. The text states: ""Uppat nga umi-ski iti grupo ti nakatugaw nga ag-ski ti saan a nakalpas kadagiti tarayda, ken **45 iti 117 a dagup nga agis-ski iti Giant Slalom ti saan a nakaranggo iti lumba**."" This translates to ""Eight skiers who skied in the group did not finish the runs, and **45 out of 117 total skiers did not rank in the Giant Slalom**.""
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw kadagiti resulta dagiti karera iti Kampeonato?,"The correct answer is **B: 45 nga skier ti saan a nakalpas ti panagtarayda iti Giant Slalom.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Uppat nga umi-ski iti grupo ti nakatugaw nga ag-ski ti saan a nakalpas kadagiti tarayda, ken 45 iti 117 a dagup nga agis-ski iti Giant Slalom ti saan a nakaranggo iti lumba."" This directly answers the question about factors influencing the results.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti maikadua a karera, immuna a nalpas ni Carpenado sakbay ti maysa nga skier manipud ti Hungary:** While true, this is just *one* detail and doesn't represent a broader influence on the results.
* **C: Ad-adu nga skier ti nakalpas iti Giant Slalom ngem ti Slalom:** The passage doesn't compare the number of falls between Slalom and Giant Slalom.
* **D: Maikasangapulo a nalpas ti Carpenado iti Slalom:** The passage states Carpenado *fell* in the Slalom, but it doesn't say she was the tenth person to fall. It just says she fell.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nangikeddengan ti NBA nga isuspende?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti season ti basketball**.

The passage states that the NBA postponed the season due to COVID-19. While a player from the Utah Jazz tested positive, the *season* was the overall thing suspended.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti gapu kadagiti pakaseknan ti NBA maipapan ti virus?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a player ti Utah Jazz a nagpositibo**.

The text states: ""Ti desision ti NBA ket makagapu ta ti maysa kadagiti basketbolista ti Utah Jazz **a nagpositibo ti Covid-19 virus**."" This directly indicates that a single player from the Utah Jazz tested positive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti miembro ti NBA a nagpositibo:** While technically true, the text specifically highlights the Utah Jazz player as the reason for the league's decision.
* **B: Sumagmamano a player a nagpositibo iti ay-ayam ti Utah Jazz:** The text says *maysa* (one), not ""sumagmamano"" (several).
* **C: Maysa a player ti Utah Jazz a saan a nagay-ayam ti kusto kalpasan ti panagpositibona:** This is not mentioned in the provided text. The text only states the player tested positive.



"
Siasino ti nakapuntos ti makapangabak a goal iti ay-ayam para ti Washington Capitals maisuppiat ti Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Ni Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Ti umuna a panangasister ni Ovechkin iti dayta a rabii ket isu ti makapangabak a goal ti agdadamo a ni Niklas Backstrom...""  This directly answers the question.
"
Siasino ti nakapuntos ti maika-60 a goal ti season bayat ti ay-ayam ti Capitals a maisuppiat ti Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Ni Alex Ovechkin**. 

The text explicitly states: ""maikadua a puntosna iti dayta a rabii ket isu ti maika-60-na iti season, a namagbalin kenkuana nga umuna a player a makapuntos iti 60 wenno nasursurok pay iti maysa a season..."" This refers to Alex Ovechkin.
"
Kaano a kasapulan ti bangko a Northern Rock ti suporta manipud ti gobierno?,"The correct answer is **D: Bayat ti krisis iti mortgage**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti Northern Rock ket nagkasapulan ti suporta gapu ti pannakaiparangna kabayatan ti krisis ti upa idi 2007."" (Northern Rock needed support due to the financial strain of the mortgage crisis in 2007).
* The other options are incorrect because:
    * **A:** The bank was nationalized *because* it needed support, not after.
    * **B:** The bank's sale to a buyer happened *after* it received government support.
    * **C:** The Virgin Group's acquisition was a separate event, not the reason the bank initially required support.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw ti transaksion ti Grupo ti Virgin iti bangko a Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **A: Ginatang met ti Grupo ti Virgin ti kompania iti panangimaton ti tagikua iti Northern Rock**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""The Virgin Group of Sir Richard Branson was given the right to bid for the bank before its nationalisation."" This directly translates to the Virgin Group being given the right to bid for the *company* (Northern Rock Asset Management) before the nationalization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ginatang ti Grupo ti Virgin ti bangko kalpasan ti panagbalinna a nasional:** The text clearly states the Virgin Group was *given the right to bid* *before* nationalization.
* **C: Nangidiaya ti Grupo ti Virgin iti bangko ti emerhensia a suporta bayat ti krisis iti mortgage:** The text mentions the bank received emergency support due to the mortgage crisis, but it doesn't say the Virgin Group received emergency support. It focused on the right to bid on the company.
* **D: Ti umuna a tawar ti Grupo ti Virgin para ti bangko ket naaramid kalpasan ti panagbalin a nasional ti bangko:** The text explicitly says they were given the right to bid *before* nationalization.

"Kas naisaad iti mabasa, ania a pagilian ti naapektaran ti panagpirma ti climate accord iti Kyoto?","The correct answer is **A: Estados Unidos**.

The passage explicitly states that Mr. Rudd's decision regarding the Kyoto climate accord ""mangilasin iti Estados Unidos"" (was a boon/advantage to the United States).
"
Kinuna ti sigud a gobierno ti Australia a ti ratification ti Kyoto ket makadadael ti ania?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti ekonomia ti pagilian**

The passage states: ""Madi a pinasingked ti sigud a konserbatibo a gobierno ti Australia ti Kyoto, ibagada a madadaelna ti ekonomiana gapuna ti kinadagsen ti pagpannurayda ti paglaklako ti karbon...""

This directly translates to: ""It was not opposed by the conservative government of Australia, which stated that it would harm its economy due to the increase in carbon trading...""

Therefore, the government of Australia claimed that ratifying the Kyoto Protocol would harm its **economy**.
"
Ania a programa ti nakare na-trail recruit dagiti shooter?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti programa ti panaganup ti Sporting Shooters Association**.

The text states: ""Ti pinagkadua iti NPWS ken ti Asosasion ti Pang-isports nga Agpalpaltog iti Australia (NSW) Inc, dagiti kwalipikado a boluntario ket naayaban, babaen iti **programa ti panaganup iti Asosasion ti Pang-isports nga Agpalpaltog**."" (The NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. jointly recruit qualified volunteers through the **recruitment program of the Sporting Shooters Association**.)
"
Ania a keddeng ti saan nga agpaypayso a manganninaw ti panagipadas a panagkontrol iti peste?,"The correct answer is **A: Gapu ta daytoy ti umuna a panagpadas ti programa, saan a natingiting daytoy**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that the effectiveness of the pest control can be *monitored*. However, it explicitly says that because it's the *first operation* of the program, the effectiveness *hasn't been assessed yet*. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti pumapaltog ket nakaawat ti instruksion ti panagensayo:**  While true, this doesn't address what *isn't* known. It talks about what *is* known.
* **C: Dagiti pumapaltog ket kitkitaen a nalaing dagiti ranger:** The text says rangers *monitor* the pest control, not that they *approve* of the rangers' skills.
* **D: Uppat a pumapaltog ti napili:** This is just a detail about the operation and doesn't explain what information is lacking.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno a nabirukan ti bisak?","The correct answer is **A: Iti Rift Valley**.

The text states: ""Kayatna a saw-en nga amin ket maisubli iti dati... iti Rift Valley Research Service iti Ethiopia..."" This clearly indicates the fossil was found in the Rift Valley.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti napasamak a nasapsapa ngem ti manamnama?","The correct answer is **C: Ti panangkedngan ti molecular nga ebidensia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kayatna a saw-en nga amin ket maisubli iti dati,” kinuna ti manangsirarak idiay Rift Valley Research Service iti Ethiopia ken kadua a mannurat ti panagadal a ni Berhane Asfaw. **“Kayatna a saw-en nga amin ket maisubli iti dati”** ket nagre-refer sa idea na ti fossil ket nagpakita ti ebidensya, ngem ti *molecular evidence* ti nagpakita iti masiyano.  The question asks what was hoped for (but wasn't fully achieved).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti pannakatakuat ti fossil** - The passage doesn't mention fear of fossils.
*   **B: Ti split** - The passage doesn't discuss a split.
*   **D: Ti panagsukisok iti Rift Valley** - The passage mentions research *in* the Rift Valley, but not that the digging itself was the desired outcome.



"
Ania ti kasapulan nga aramiden ti player tapno ma-manipular dagiti garaw bayat ti video game?,"The correct answer is **B: I-traingulate ti posisionda**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the controller uses two sensors to be positioned relative to the TV.  
* The key concept here is **traingulation**. Traingulation uses the positions of multiple sensors to calculate the controller's exact position in 3D space. This allows for precise control based on movements in the air.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Siguradoen a dagiti sensor ti controller ket nakaposision nga asideg iti console:** While the sensors need to be positioned relative to the TV, the main point isn't just about being positioned; it's about their *relative position to each other and the TV* for 3D tracking.
* **C: Ikabil dagiti sensor asideg iti telebision:** This is the opposite of what's needed! The sensors need to be *facing* the TV.
* **D: Iyakar ti controller iti angin:**  The passage describes controlling actions by moving the controller in the air, but it doesn't say *how* to do it. Traingulation is the mechanism that allows this air movement to be translated into in-game actions.



"
Ania ti nadisenio a kasla remote ti telebision?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti controller ti Nintendo Revolution**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kas met leng iti remote ti telebision, ti kontroler..."". This means the controller is designed to function similarly to a television remote.
"
Ania ti saan a naisaad iti kabaruan a padamag manipud ti ahensia ti damag iti Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Naglanding ti eroplano iti Ürümqi**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *wasn't* mentioned. The news report states the plane was hijacked, had a bomb threat, and flew to Afghanistan (specifically Kandahar). It *also* states the plane was hijacked *after* a protest in Ürümqi. Therefore, the plane landing in Ürümqi is explicitly mentioned as happening *before* the hijacking and flight to Afghanistan.

The other options *are* mentioned in the report:

*   **A: Nakaawat ti bomb threat ti eroplano** - The report states the plane had a bomb threat.
*   **C: Ti eroplano ket naiturong iti Afghanistan** - The report states the plane was headed to Afghanistan.
*   **D: Naglanding ti eroplano iti Kandahar** - The report states the plane landed in Kandahar.



"
Ania ti saan a naisaad iti baro a kaunaan a padamag ti ahensia ti damag iti Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti eroplano ket napagkeddengan iti emerhensia a panaglanding**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the *newest* report from Xinhua *doesn't* say. The prompt states the latest reports *do* say the plane made an emergency landing in Afghanistan. Options A, C, and D are all explicitly mentioned in the prompt. Option B, stating an emergency landing, is what's *not* mentioned in the newest report.
"
Ania ti inbaga ni Sara Danius bayat ti programana iti radio?,"The correct answer is **D: Isardeng ton ti komite dagiti aramid a mangkontak ken ni Bob Dylan.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that Sara Danius was speaking about the committee's *lack of communication* with Bob Dylan regarding the 2016 prize.
* She mentions sending an email and receiving a positive response, but then says ""Ita, umanay daydiayen"" (meaning ""That's it, that's where it ends""). This implies the committee had already taken action to contact Dylan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti nangabak ti Nobel Prize iti Literatura** (The winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature) - The passage is about *not* awarding the prize to Dylan.
* **B: Ti komite ket saan a nakaawat ti sungbat manipud kadagiti collaborator** (The committee did not receive a response from the collaborators) - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Dagiti nainominar iti 2016 para ti Nobel Prize iti Literatura** (The nominees for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature) - While the conversation was *about* the 2016 prize, the passage doesn't say she was talking about the nominees.



"
Siasino ti saan a madanon?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti Swedish Academy**. 

Here's why:

The passage states that Sara Danius *addressed* the Swedish Academy's reluctance to award Bob Dylan the Nobel Prize. The question asks who was *not* mentioned as being able to respond or act. The Swedish Academy is the organization responsible for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and the passage indicates they weren't engaging in dialogue.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti asideg a collaborator ni Bob Dylan:** The passage doesn't mention anyone collaborating with Bob Dylan.
*   **B: Ni Sara Danius:** Sara Danius *was* mentioned, as she was the one speaking about the issue.
*   **D: Ni Bob Dylan:** Bob Dylan is directly mentioned as the subject of the discussion about the Nobel Prize.



"
Siasino ti nagkomento iti kari kas “maysa a napateg nga addang”?,"The correct answer is **C: Ni Gordon Johndroe**.

The text states that Gordon Johndroe, a spokesperson for Bush, described North Korea as ""a big kid pointing a finger at the United States regarding its nuclear weapons program on the Korean peninsula.""  The question asks who commented on the statement as ""a big kid,"" and that comment was made *by* Gordon Johndroe.
"
Mano nga stamp ti naala ni Slania manipud kadagiti agduduma a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **A: Nasurok 2,000**.

The text states: ""Nakaaramid isuna ti ad-adu ngem 1,000 a selio para ti Sweden ken 28 a dadduma a nasion."" This translates to ""He created more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other nations.""  Therefore, the total number of stamps he made for other countries is more than 1,000, making the approximate total number of stamps he created around 2,000.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a gapu ti agtul-tuloy a panagtedted manipud kadagiti tank vent?","The correct answer is **C: Thermal a panaglawa (Thermal expansion)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Agingga idi malem iti Miyerkules, agtagtagas latta iti tangke mabalin nga gapo iti panagbellad gapo iti kabara iti uneg ti tangke.""  This means the leaking is due to pressure building up *inside* the tank.
* **Thermal expansion** is the increase in volume of a substance due to an increase in temperature.  If the crude oil inside the tank heats up (e.g., due to sunlight), it will expand.  This expansion will create pressure, causing the tank vent to leak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti sekundaria a containment a lugar a napno agingga ti kapasidadna (The secondary containment area is full to capacity):** The passage mentions a secondary containment area, but doesn't link the leaking to it being full. It's the tank itself that's leaking.
* **B: Maysa a rutina nga eksamen para ti fire-command a sistema (A routine inspection for the fire-command system):**  While inspections are routine, the passage connects the leak to pressure buildup within the tank, not to a system inspection.
* **D: Uram iti maysa kadagiti pump station ti Fort Greely (A power outage at one of the pump stations at Fort Greely):** The passage doesn't mention any power outage.



"
Apay a naglukat dagiti relied valves?,"The correct answer is **B: Adda pannakapukaw ti koriente kalpasan ti system test.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti panagawan ti koriente kalpasan ti gagangay a pannakaipadas ti sistema ti fire-command ti nakaigapu iti pannakalukat dagiti balbula ti pangtimon ket isu a naglipias ti krudo...""  This directly links the power surge from the fire-command system test to the opening of the valves and subsequent oil leak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adda ti thermal a panaglawa iti uneg ti tangke:** While thermal expansion *could* cause pressure, the passage explicitly states the power surge caused the valves to open. Thermal expansion is a secondary effect.
* **C: Naan-anay ti kapasidad dagiti tangke:** The passage mentions the tank capacities, but doesn't state that the tank capacity was the reason for the valves being opened.
* **D: Ti sekundaria a containment a lugar ket saan a makalaon kadagiti naan-anay a bariles:** The passage states the secondary containment *could* hold 104,500 barrels, but that it wasn't full.  It doesn't link the reason for the valves being opened to the secondary containment's capacity.



"
"Ita, kasano kangato ti danum iti The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Inggana siket**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the water level *after* the levee failure.** The passage states that the water level was ""inggana siket"" (significantly high) due to the levee breach.
* **Option A (20 feet) refers to the historical flood depth.**
* **Option B (6 inches) refers to the U.S. Corps of Engineers' estimate of potential future flooding.**
* **Option D (100 feet) refers to the length of the levee that failed.**

Therefore, the only option that describes the water level *after* the levee failure is ""Inggana siket.""
"
"Bayat ti Bagyo a Katrina, ania ti napasamak iti The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **B: Nangat-ngato ti inggana siket a danum iti penned**. 

Here's why:

* The question asks what happened to The Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.
* The passage states: ""The Ninth Ward, which was devastated by up to 20 feet of water, felt the strain of the nearby levee failing. Water flooded the landfill in an area 100 feet from the levee."" 
* While the passage mentions 100 feet from the levee and 20 feet of water, it's the flooding *in the ward* that is the main event being described. Option B best captures the severity of the flooding in the ward.
* Option A is too specific, mentioning only the 100 feet from the levee, not the overall flooding event.
* Option C is incorrect; the passage states up to 20 feet, not 20 feet from the levee.
* Option D is also incorrect; the 6 inches refers to the depth of water *in the landfill*, not the main flooding in the ward.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a kinumpirma ti Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **A: No sadinno a nagbiahe ti pasiente (Whether the patient had traveled anywhere)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that Hamilton confirmed the patient was in good condition and had been in Nigeria where other Ebola cases occurred.** It also confirms the hospital took precautions to control infection.
* **The passage *doesn't* mention if the patient had traveled anywhere *other than* Nigeria.**  Therefore, Hamilton did *not* confirm this aspect.
* **B: Ti posibilidad a naala ti dadduma a pasiente ti virus (The possibility of other patients contracting the virus)** is *implied* by the hospital's actions (isolating patients).
* **C: No nasurot ti kusto a protokol (Whether strict protocols were followed)** is *implied* by the statement that the hospital ""nasurot ti paglintegan tapno makontrol ti impeksion"" (disinfected the hospital to control the infection).
* **D: Ti agdama a kondision ti pasiente (The patient's initial condition)** is stated as ""nasayaat ti kasasaad daytoy"" (in good condition).



Therefore, the only thing Hamilton did *not* confirm based on the provided text is whether the patient had traveled anywhere *besides* Nigeria.



"
Ania ti maysa a banag a kayat a maammuan dagiti sientista?,"The correct answer is **A: No madungpar dagiti comet ti Lubong (If the comets of the Solar System are understood).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nangnamnama dagiti sientista a maawatanda no kasano a nabukel dagiti planeta, nangruna no kasano a nabukel ti Daga, gapu ta nakidinnungpar dagiti kometa iti Daga idi un-unana."" (Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially the Solar System, formed, because comets impacted the Solar System in the early days.)

* **The passage connects comets to the formation of the Solar System.** The scientists are hoping that understanding comets will provide clues about planetary formation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Kasano a mabubuo dagiti protina (How proteins are formed):** While proteins are important for life, the passage focuses on the formation of the Solar System itself.
* **C: Ania ti organic matter (What organic matter is):**  The passage assumes the existence of organic matter and focuses on how it might have contributed to the formation of life and planets.
* **D: Kasano a nabuo ti Lubong (How the Solar System formed):** While this is related, the passage specifically points to comets as a key element in understanding the Solar System's formation.  Therefore, understanding comets is the more direct goal.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti amad ti lokal a pulis iti closure?","The correct answer is **A: Inkalikagumda iti FBI nga aramiden ti closure**.

The passage states: ""ti Maryland Transportaion Authority ket naiserra gapu ti panangpilit ti FBI."" This means the FBI *forced* the closure, and the Authority *obeyed* the FBI's order. Option A best reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inkeddengda nga aramiden ti closure:** The passage doesn't suggest the police *agreed* to the closure. It implies they were compelled to do so.
*   **C: Insuroda kadagiti motorista dagiti sabali a ruta:** While the police *did* help direct traffic, this isn't the primary action they took *regarding* the closure itself.
*   **D: Inpadamagda dagiti pannakaitantan ti trapiko iti alternatibo a ruta:** This describes the police's role in managing traffic flow *around* the closure, not the reason for the closure itself.



"
Ania ti napasamak kadagiti pagserrekan a tubo bayat ti closure?,"The correct answer is **A: Naserraan ida**.

The passage states: ""Bayat ti closure, **nausar dagiti dump truck a pangserra kadagiti pagserkan ti tubo**..."" This directly indicates that the pipes were closed/sealed.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan a napasamak sakbay a nadungpar ti lugan ti retratista?","The correct answer is **C: Nangala ti retrista kadagiti ladawan ti police stop**.

The text states: ""Pulis Patrol ti Kalsada ti California ti nagtultuloy tapno pagsublien isuna ti mamindua. Segun kadagiti polis, ti nagmaneho iti lugan a nagdungpar iti retratista ket saan a maaddaan ti kaso a kriminal.""  This implies the photographer was taking pictures *during* the police stop and was asked to stop, but the text doesn't say they were taking pictures *of* Justin Bieber. The text specifically says the photographer took photos *of the police stop*.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti retratista ket inbilin ti Highway Patrol nga agsubli iti dalan** - While the text mentions the photographer was asked to stop and was told to return, the core issue isn't about being told to go back down the road.
*   **B: Ti retrista ket nagparada ti luganna iti Sepulveda Boulevard** - The text states the photographer was *taking pictures* at the police stop on Sepulveda Boulevard, not that they parked there.
*   **D: Ti retrista ket nakaala ti ladawan ni Bieber** - The text says Bieber made a statement about the photographer taking pictures, but it doesn't clarify whether Bieber was the subject of those pictures."
Ania ti padpadasen nga aramiden ti retrista sakbay a nadungpar isuna ti lugan?,"The correct answer is **B: Mangala kadagiti ladawan ti police stop**.

The passage states: ""…pinadasna a mangala iti ladawan dagiti pulis a nagsardeng sakbay a dimmaliasat iti kalsada…"" (…he posed for pictures with the police officers who were stopping him…"").
"
Ania kadagiti keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti kondision ti presidente kalpasan ti panagpositibona ti virus?,"The correct answer is **A: Madi ti riknana (His resistance is not good)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nasayaat ti riknak ken addaak iti nasayaat a kondision iti bagi tapno aramiden ti trabaho bayat ti telecommuting."" This translates to: ""His resistance is good and he has a good condition of his body to do work while telecommuting.""

Option A, ""Madi ti riknana"" (His resistance is not good), is the opposite of what the text says.  The text explicitly states his resistance *is* good.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lumteg ti karabukobna (His cough worsened):** The text says he has a cough (""gurigor"") but doesn't say it's worsening.
* **C: Natalged ti kondisionna (His condition improved):** While he's doing well overall, the text mentions he's staying home for a few days, implying his condition isn't fully recovered.
* **D: Adda gurigorna (He has a cough):** The text explicitly states he has a cough (""gurigor"").



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti presidente ti agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **B: Agtalinaed isuna iti balay iti sumagmamano a lawas.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""ngem mailasin isuna iti balayda iti mano nga aldaw."" This translates to ""but he will stay home for a few days.""
* Option A is incorrect because the text mentions he has a cough.
* Option C is correct, but option B is a more direct and complete answer to the question.
* Option D is incorrect because the text says the virus isn't severe.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **B**.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a manamnama a kumapsut ti Bagyo a Gonu?","The correct answer is **B: No kumapsut dagiti angin iti nasurok 83 a kilometro kada oras**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Itay nasapa a bigat, ti kapartak ti angin ket mapan a 83 km/h, ket manamnama a kumapkapsuten daytoy."" This translates to ""This reduced force, the wind speed is expected to be 83 km/h, and it is hoped that it will subside.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sakbayna a madanon ti Maldives** - This is too general. While the storm is affecting the Maldives, it doesn't specify *how* it is expected to subside.
* **C: Sakbay a madanonna ti kapigpigsaanna** -  This is a restatement of the storm's strength and doesn't address the question of how it will subside.
* **D: Sakbay a madanonna dagiti angin a 149 a milya kada oras** - This is incorrect. 149 miles per hour is approximately 239 km/h, which is the *initial* wind speed of the storm, not the expected speed for it to subside.



"
Kasano kapartak dagiti angin iti kapigpigsaan ti Bagyo a Gonu?,"The correct answer is **D: 83 a kilometro kada oras**.

The passage states: ""Itay nasapa a bigat, ti kapartak ti angin ket mapan a 83 km/h, ket manamnama a kumapkapsuten daytoy."" This translates to: ""This reduced speed, the wind gust is expected to reach 83 km/h.""
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a langa ti Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **D: Natural a mapaspasamak daytoy**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Karenia brevis is a natural marine algae.** While being natural doesn't automatically make something harmless, it's not what the passage focuses on as a *negative* characteristic in this context. The problem isn't simply that it's natural; it's the *harmful effects* it has when it blooms.

Let's look at why the other options *are* considered negative characteristics:

* **A: Tipo daytoy ti lumot:** This is accurate information from the passage.
* **B: Mabalinna a ma-disable dagiti urat ti tao:** This is a direct negative effect mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Adu ti selyulana:** This is also stated in the passage as a contributing factor to the red tide's intensity and harm.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a kabaelan nga aramiden ti Karena brevis?,"The correct answer is **B: Napartak nga umadu iti aniaman a kondision (Can multiply in any condition)**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** ""Dagiti natural a makagapu ket mabalin nga agsisinnabat tapno makaaramid ti nasayaat a kasasaad, nga agpalubos kadagitoy a lumot nga umado iti kasta la unay."" This means the red tide can multiply *easily* under favorable conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-disable dagiti urat ti lames (Disable the nerves):** The text *does* state that Karenia brevis produces a neurotoxin that *can* paralyze nerves.
*   **C: Apektaran ti danum (Affect the water):**  The text explicitly says the red tide *affects* the water.
*   **D: Mangaramid ti neurotoxin (Produce a neurotoxin):** The text states that the red tide *does* produce a neurotoxin.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a napasamak kas resulta ti Bagyo a Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: Panaglayos ti kalsada**.

The text states: ""nupay kasta agingga ita, awan pay ti naipadamag a nadadael wenno layus."" (however, as of now, there are no reported deaths or injuries.) While the text mentions ""panagurruod ken naynay a panagkimat"" (flooding and heavy rain), it doesn't mention road damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makagunggona a panagtudo** - The text mentions ""dadduma kadagiti panagtudo ket addaan kadagiti panagurruod ken naynay a panagkimat"" (other reports include flooding and heavy rain).
*   **B: Tudo nga napakuyugan iti gurru-od** - The text explicitly states ""Ti presipitasion, a dumanon iti 6.34 a pulgada iti maysa a pagrukodan idiay Oahu, ket nailadawan a “makaited iti benepisio”"" (The precipitation, which amounted to 6.34 inches in one area of Oahu, is considered a ""benefit""). This indicates flooding *did* occur.
*   **C: Maul-ulit a kimat** - The text mentions ""naynay a panagkimat"" (heavy rain).

Therefore, the only thing *not* reported in the text is road damage.



"
Ania kadagiti keddeng ti saan nga agpaypayso maipapan ti Bagyo a Felicia?,"The correct answer is **B: Damo a naikategoria kas tropikal a depresion sakbay a nagbalin a Kategoria 4 a bagyo.**

Here's why:

* The text states that Hurricane Felicia *weakened to a tropical depression* after being a Category 4 hurricane. Option B accurately reflects this.
* Option A is incorrect because the text mentions that the storm *affected* Oahu.
* Option C is correct: ""Nangparnuay kadagiti panagarbis iti kaaduan a paset ti isla ti nabatbati ti bagyo"" translates to ""affected most parts of the island.""
* Option D is correct: ""Dadduma kadagiti panagtudo ket addaan kadagiti panagurruod ken naynay a panagkimat"" translates to ""Other reports indicate thunderstorms and gusty winds.""

Therefore, the only option that describes something that *didn't* happen is that the storm weakened from a Category 4 hurricane to a tropical depression.
"
Ania kadagiti keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw ti nagbanagan ti 2009 a Hungarian Grand Prix?,"The correct answer is **B: Nangabak ni Piquet Jr.**

Here's why:

The question asks about the reason for the scandal related to the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. The provided text states: ""Naribbek ni Piquet Jr. kalpasan ti 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" (Piquet Jr. was implicated after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix).  The scandal revolved around Piquet Jr. deliberately crashing to allow Alonso to win.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naaksidente ni Fernando Alonso:** While Alonso did have an accident in Singapore 2008, it's not directly related to the Hungarian Grand Prix 2009 scandal.
* **C: Naikkat ni Piquet Jr. kalpasanna:** While Piquet Jr. was later dismissed, this wasn't the *cause* of the scandal.  The scandal was the *act* of intentionally crashing.
* **D: Ti lugan iti kinatalged ket naaksidente:**  The track wasn't involved.  The incident was deliberately caused by Piquet Jr.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Piquet Jr. was involved in the scandal.
"
Kaano a napasamak ti pannakadungpar?,"The correct answer is **B: Bayat nga agkar-karga ti gas dagiti dadduma a lugan**.

The passage states that the chaos started ""when other cars were refueling to extend their pit stop time."" This is directly related to the reason for Piquet Jr.'s crash.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nangikasapulan ti basbassit nga oras ngem ti orihinal a pammati dagiti sientista?","The correct answer is **A: Ti panagbuo ti species**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the research reports the *discovery* of a new species. This implies the *speciation* event (the process of forming new species) happened.
* The research focused on *how* this speciation happened, specifically the timeline and contributing factors.
* Options B, C, and D are broader concepts. While the research *touches* on evolution and breeding, the core finding is the emergence of a new species – the speciation event itself. The focus is on *how* the speciation happened over a relatively short timeframe, not just the existence of the species or general evolutionary processes.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naipadamag dagiti tagasukisok?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti nagan ti baro nga species**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what the researchers *didn't* report.
* The passage explicitly states the researchers reported the *process* of speciation (the evolution of new species over two generations) and the specific finch species involved.
* The passage doesn't mention the name of the new species being published. It only mentions that the discovery was reported in the journal *Science*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: No sadinno a nabuo ti baro nga species:** The entire question is *about* the formation of a new species.
* **B: Ti kaatiddog ti proseso ti ebolusion:** The passage *does* report on the process of evolution.
* **D: Dagiti billet a nainaig iti panag-breed:** The passage mentions the specific finch species and their breeding patterns as part of the study.



"
Sadinno a maangay ti CowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: Iti siudad ti Bucharest**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti siudad ti agbalin a kaunaan idiay abagatan a daya ti Europa a mangpadagos ti Parada dagiti Baka..."" which translates to ""The city is becoming the first in southeastern Europe to host CowParade...""  This directly links CowParade to Bucharest.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw ti CowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: Daytoy ti kadakkelan a pasamak ti publiko nga artes iti lubong**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...sangkadakkelan ditoy lubong a pasamak ti arte para publiko..."" ( ...is a large public art event in the world...)
* **Option A** is incorrect because the text doesn't say it's *only* for ""creative"" cities, just that Bucharest is being positioned as such.
* **Option B** is partially true, but less accurate than D. While the Bucharest City Hall is organizing it, the event itself is much larger than just a City Hall initiative.
* **Option C** is incorrect because the text mentions the event attracting attention from across southeastern Europe, but doesn't limit its appeal to that region.  It calls it a ""large"" event *worldwide*.



"
Ania ti gapu a sinuspende ti Russia ti panagusar ti II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa nga aksidente (One accident)**.

The text states: ""Pinasardeng iti Russia iti panagbiyahe dagiti Il-76 idi malpas daydiay nga aksidente."" (In Russia, the operation of Il-76s was suspended after that accident.)  The passage then goes on to describe the accident: ""Idi Oktubre maysa a makina iti naisina idi pagtayab, ngem awan nasugatan."" (In October, one engine failed during takeoff, but no one was injured.)

While an investigation was conducted (option D), the *reason* for the suspension was the accident itself. Options A and C are incorrect as the suspension isn't related to troop deployment or the Soviet military in general.
"
Ania ti II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Maysa nga eroplano (An airplane)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti Il-76 ket kangrunaan a mangbukel ti agpada a militar ti Russia ken Soviet manipud idi 1970..."".  This directly identifies the Il-76 as an airplane.
"
Siasino ti nag-hire ti grupo ti mannurat para ti The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **D: Ni Groening**.

The text states: ""Idi 1989 timmulong isuna a nangparnuay iti The Simpsons a kaduana da Brooks ken Groening..."" This indicates that Groening was involved in creating The Simpsons and, therefore, likely involved in hiring the writers. While Brooks was also involved, the question asks *who* hired the group. Groening is presented as one of the key figures in the creation of the show."
"Segun iti Fluke, siasino ti mangipat-patulod kadagiti positibo a komento ken pangpapigsa ti nakem?","The correct answer is **D: Agpada a lalaki ken babbai nga indibidual**.

The passage states that Fluke came to his conclusion because he received positive feedback and validation from both men and women who identified contraception as a medical necessity. Therefore, the positive comments and validation came from both genders.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan a kayat ti sumagmamano a tattao kadagiti babbai a saritaenda?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti lalaki nga indibidual (Male individuals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Fluke was *not* convinced by the opinions and feedback he received *from men* regarding contraception being a medical necessity. He was swayed by women's accounts. Therefore, the passage implies that some men disagree with the idea of contraception being a medical necessity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti medikal a gastos (Medical expenses):** The passage doesn't focus on medical expenses.
* **C: Salun-at ti babbai (Female anatomy):** The passage discusses female anatomy in the context of women sharing their experiences, but it doesn't indicate this is something people are *against*.
* **D: Fluke:** The passage describes Fluke's perspective, not that people are against him.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a planetary body ti pinakadinamiko?","The correct answer is **A: Lubong**. 

The text states: ""Kas ammotayo, adda maymaysa laeng a planeta a mangipakpakita iti kinaregta ngem Titan, ket ti naganna daytoy ket Lubong."" This translates to ""As we know, there is only one planet that shows dynamic activity, and its name is Titan.""  The passage then goes on to say that Titan is another name for the moon, and the text implies it is the *most* dynamic body, not just one that shows dynamic activity. Therefore, the question is poorly worded, and assuming the question means which body is *called* the most dynamic based on the text, the answer is Lubong.

However, if the question is asking which planetary body is *actually* the most dynamic, even if not explicitly stated, and considering Titan is a moon of Saturn, and Saturn is a planet, and Titan is known for its dynamic atmosphere, the wording implies the answer is Lubong, which is the name of Titan.
"
Dagiti karayan ken dan-aw nga aglaon ti transparent a likido ket naamiris iti ania a planetary body?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kas ammotayo, adda maymaysa laeng a planeta a mangipakpakita iti kinaregta ngem Titan, ket ti naganna daytoy ket Lubong."" (As we know, there is only one planet that shows rain, and its name is Titan.)

The question asks where transparent liquids in rivers and lakes are found. The text connects this phenomenon directly to Titan.
"
Ania kadagitoy a nabirukan ti saan a resulta ti natakkuatan iti dutdot?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti plumage a maris ti animal (The colorful plumage of animals)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that scientists believe dinosaur spots were likely due to carotenoid pigments (similar to cat's coat color) from their diet.** This directly relates to the *color* of the spots, not the *plumage* (feathers). 
* **The passage *does* mention that the changing pattern of spots in small ones could indicate evolution of spots.**  This supports option C.
* **The passage *does* state that spots were not made of bone (rachis) but had other structures, suggesting evolution of spots.** This supports option C.
* **The passage *does* indicate that many dinosaurs likely had spots.** This supports option D.
* **The passage *does* state that spots were not used for thermoregulation or display, but for balancing temperature or as camouflage.** This supports option B.



Therefore, the colorful plumage of animals is the only option that isn't directly addressed or supported by the information given in the passage.



"
Ania ti awan kadagiti dutdot ti dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti rachis**. 

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dagiti dutdot ti dinosaur ket saan a naaramid a nalaing ti ungkayna, a maawagan iti rachis...""  This means the rachis (the central shaft of the feather) is *absent* in dinosaur feathers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti barbule:** Barbules are small, hook-like structures on feathers. While not mentioned as *present*, the passage doesn't say they are *absent*.
* **C: Nataengan a plumage:** The passage discusses feathers (plumage) in general. It doesn't say they are absent.
* **D: Ti napusiaw a maris iti akin-unegna:** The passage mentions the feathers are thought to have been used for temperature regulation and display. It also talks about the possibility of feathers developing from scales and having an ""air sac."" The presence of an air sac is related to a ""napusiaw a maris"" (inflated sac) but the passage does not directly say they were absent.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti ZMapp ti saan nga agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **C: Nagserbi kas kontrol ti panagpadas iti PALM**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""In the PALM trial, Zmapp served as a control..."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naaramid daytoy manipud kadagiti antibody:** While true, the question asks what Zmapp *doesn't* have.  Its origin is relevant, but not what the question is probing.
* **B: Kabaelanna nga agasan dagiti agdama nga impeksion ngem saan a manglap-lapped ti pannakatay:** The text explicitly says Zmapp showed ""limited benefit"" in preventing death. Therefore, the statement that it *does* significantly reduce mortality is incorrect.
* **D: Ipakita dagiti panagadal dagiti benepisiona ket basbassit ngem no ania ti damo a nakunada:** The text states the benefits are ""limited"".  The option implies significant benefits.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagpadas iti PALM?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti ZMapp ket nausar kas baseline ti panagpadas.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the PALM trial used Zmapp as a control group.  This means they compared the effectiveness of the new experimental vaccine and other treatments *to* Zmapp. Therefore, Zmapp served as the baseline for comparison.
* Option A is too general. While the trials showed some benefit, it doesn't specifically address the *purpose* of using Zmapp as a benchmark.
* Option B is partially true, but the main point is that Zmapp was the standard against which the other treatments were measured.
* Option D is incorrect. The passage explicitly says that Zmapp had limited benefit and wasn't a significant preventative measure.



"
Sadinno a makuna dagiti tagasukisok a kapapatganto ti baro a chip?,"The correct answer is **A: Kadagiti nababa ti matgedanna a pagilian**.

The passage explicitly states that the chip is intended to help with diseases in ""napapanglaw a pagilian"" (impoverished countries) where access to diagnosis is limited, and gives the example of breast cancer in poor countries versus wealthy countries. This directly supports the idea that the chip is targeted towards less affluent nations.
"
Ania a wagasto ti mausar tapno maaramid ti dayagnostik nga alikamen?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti mabalin a maiyimprenta a chip**.

The passage explicitly states: ""posible nga agbalor ti maysa a sentimo ti U.S. kada maysa"" and ""maysa a bassit a maimprenta a chip"". This directly points to the printed chip as the diagnostic tool.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng maipapan ti lobate scarps ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti pasamak a nangaramid kadagitoy ket napasamak itay nabiit.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the lobate scarps show ""minimal erosion,"" indicating that the geological events that formed them happened *recently* – meaning they haven't been significantly weathered or altered over a long period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti kaadda dagitoy kaipapananna a ti bulan ket saan nga agkurang iti geolohikal nga aktibidad:** The passage *supports* the idea of geological activity, albeit recent activity.  The existence of scarps implies activity.
* **C: Mabalin a resultada ti panagbassit ti bulan:** While lunar recession *could* play a role in geological processes, the passage doesn't directly link the scarps to it. It focuses on the *recentness* of the events.
* **D: Bassit laeng ti nabirukan a kastoy iti rabaw ti bulan:** The passage explicitly states that lobate scarps *have* been found, suggesting they are not rare.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a theory maipapan kadagiti landform ti mangibaga nga adda ti geolohikal nga aktibidad a mapaspasamak iti bulan?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti landform ket naaramid itay nabiit laeng.**

The passage states: ""Dagiti bato ket nabirokan iti aglawlaw iti bulan ken agparang a bassit laeng ti pannakadadaelna, mangipakita a dagiti geolohiko a pasamak nga aramid kaniada ket kadagitoy laeng."" This directly supports the idea that the landforms are relatively young, implying recent geological activity.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nabattag a buma-bassit ti bulan:** The passage doesn't mention the moon shrinking.
* **B: Dagiti landform ket naaramiden idi pay:** This contradicts the passage, which suggests the landforms are relatively recent.
* **C: Bassit laeng ti kaadu dagiti landform iti rabaw ti bulan:** The passage focuses on the *type* of landforms (lobate scarps) and their implication of activity, not their abundance.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan nga umadon agingga ti indictment?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti panangipablaak ti ladawan (Publication of images)**.

The passage explicitly states that Professor Pamela Ferguson notes that ""journalists are strongly cautious about crossing the line when publishing images of victims."" The context of the question asks what hasn't been brought forward *until the indictment*. The passage implies that the publication of images is a key factor influencing the timing of that.

While the other options *could* be factors, the passage directly links the caution of journalists and the potential for prejudicing the trial to the *publication of images*.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan nga agdama a problema para kadagiti sealer?","The correct answer is **A: Nakaro a kondision ti panawen (Harsh weather conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""the conditions haven't improved since the last 15 years."" It then mentions that the **freeze-thaw cycle** (the freezing and thawing of the ice) is the primary factor causing the problem. 

Let's look at the options:

* **A: Nakaro a kondision ti panawen (Harsh weather conditions):** While harsh weather *contributes* to the freeze-thaw cycle, the passage specifically identifies the *cycle itself* as the main problem.
* **B: Ti kaadu ti yelo (Excess ice):** The passage doesn't mention excess ice as a problem.
* **C: Ti kapuskol ti yelo (Ice cracking):** The passage mentions the cracking of ice as a problem (""The freeze and thaw cycle cracks the ice""), but it's a *result* of the freeze-thaw cycle, not the primary issue.
* **D: Ti marun-runaw a yelo (Melting ice):** The passage mentions the melting of ice as a consequence of the freeze-thaw cycle. 

Therefore, the passage suggests that the *ongoing and repeated freeze-thaw cycle* is the main problem, and while harsh weather plays a role, it's not the core issue that's making it difficult to maintain sealers. The passage doesn't mention an excess of ice.



"
"Malaksid iti yelo, ania pay ti mangapektar kadagiti panagregget a mangispal?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti kondision ti panawen (Weather conditions)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kinuna ni Pittman a dagiti kondision ket saan nga umimbag agingga iti sumaruno a lawas."" (Pittman said that conditions will not improve for at least another year.) This directly links weather conditions to the problem of ice melt.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Ti gatad ken kinapuskol diay pakete a yelo, sigun ken ni Pittman, ket isu ti sangkakaruan ti amin nga agtiltiliw ti foca iti napalabas a 15 a tawen."" (Pittman says that the deterioration of the ice packs is the main reason for the loss of focus over the past 15 years.) This further emphasizes the impact of changing conditions on the ice.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kinakurang ti suplay (Reduced supply):** While a reduced supply *could* be a factor, the passage focuses on *melting* ice, not a lack of ice.
* **C: Kinakurang ti tulong (Reduced assistance):**  The passage doesn't mention any assistance being reduced.
* **D: Dagiti sealer (The sealers):** The passage mentions the deterioration of the ice packs, not the sealers themselves.

Therefore, the most relevant answer based on the provided text is **B: Dagiti kondision ti panawen (Weather conditions)**.



"
Ania a pammati ti saan a pinaneknekan ni Roberts?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti kina-etikal ti panagsarita maipapan kadagiti kaso**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states Roberts declined to comment on the ethics of abortion cases.** He specifically said it was unethical to comment on the details of the financial aspects of the case.
* **The passage highlights his strong stance on *Roe v. Wade* as a ""settled precedent"" and the importance of individual privacy.** He emphasized that the right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment underpinned the decision in *Roe*.
* **Option B (the importance of non-binding Supreme Court rulings):**  While Roberts might have opinions on this generally, the passage doesn't indicate he specifically addressed it.
* **Option C (the beginning of life):**  The passage acknowledges the ethical debate surrounding the beginning of life but focuses on Roberts' refusal to comment on the specifics of the case and his commitment to *Roe*.
* **Option D (individual privacy):**  Roberts *did* address individual privacy, stating it was the basis of the *Roe* decision. Therefore, this is incorrect.



"
Ania a topiko ti narikna ni Roberts a saan nga etikal a pagsasaritaan?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti espesipiko a banag dagiti kaso (Specific details of the cases)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Roberts felt it was unethical to comment on the ""details of the cost of the case"" (referring to the specifics of individual abortion cases).
*   He was willing to discuss the broader legal precedent of Roe v. Wade.
*   He also acknowledged the importance of privacy in the Roe v. Wade decision.
*   He didn't express discomfort with the rulings of the Supreme Court as a whole.

Therefore, the focus of his ethical concern was on delving into the specific details of individual abortion cases.



"
Sadinno nga agran-raniag dagiti dua a silnag ti silaw?,"The correct answer is **A: Agturong iti tangatang**.

The text states: ""Dua a raniag ti silaw ti naipaturong nga agpangato iti tangatang ti agpatnag..."" This directly translates to ""Two beams of light were directed to point at the tower...""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a maipatakder dagiti baro nga skyscraper iti site?","The correct answer is **C: Iti agpatnag**. 

The passage states: ""Dua a raniag ti silaw ti naipaturong nga agpangato iti tangatang ti agpatnag Madama ti pannakabangon ti lima a baro a nangangato a pasdek..."" This translates to: ""Two beams of light were directed towards the construction site, feeling the rise of five new large skyscrapers...""  Therefore, the skyscrapers are being built ""iti agpatnag"" (during construction).



"
Ania nga impormasion ti mangisingasing a ti The Seven Sisters ket kueba?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti panagduduma ti temperatura**.

The passage explicitly states that infrared images show temperature differences between day and night, and that the Seven Sisters caves are warmer during the day and cooler at night. This temperature variation is presented as evidence that they are caves. The other options are not directly mentioned as evidence *that* they are caves.
"
Kasano a naobserbar ti thermal a panagtignay iti Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti infrared a ladawan (Infrared images)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ipakita dagiti infrared nga imahena a dagiti panagduduma ti temperatura manipud rabii ken aldaw..."" which translates to ""Show infrared images of the temperature differences between day and night..."" This directly answers the question of how the thermal activity of the Seven Sisters was observed.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng ti maipapan ti suspek ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **B: Pinasabogna kano ti bomba (Planted the bomb)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti lalaki a mapabpabasol a nangpabettak diay bomba ket natiliw..."" which translates to ""The suspect who planted the bomb was killed...""  This directly answers the question of what the suspect is accused of.
"
Ania nga impormasion maipapan ti panangraut ti nakumpirma dagiti autoridad?,"The best answer is **D: Ti umuna ken maudi a nagan ti suspek.**

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Saan pay nga ammo dagiti autoridad ti naganna..."" This directly indicates that the authorities *don't* know the suspect's name, only that he belongs to the Uyghur ethnic group.
* **Option D directly reflects this lack of confirmed information:** ""Ti umuna ken maudi a nagan ti suspek"" implies the authorities *don't* yet have this information.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ti kinasiasino ti aniaman a kakumplot:** The question mentions a single suspect, not a conspiracy.
* **B: Ti puli ti suspek:** The question doesn't provide any information about the suspect's physical description.
* **C: Ti motibo iti likudan ti panangraut:** The question doesn't mention anything about the motive.

Therefore, the only option that aligns with the information provided in the question is D."
Ania kadagiti grupo ti agay-ayam iti Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: South Africa ken Australia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Daydiay ti maudi a laban para iti All Blacks, a nangabaken iti tropeo dua a lawasen ti napalabas. Maangay ti maudi a laban iti serye iti Ellis Park iti Johannesburg inton sumaruno a lawas, a kaay-ayam ti Springboks ti Australia.""

This translates to: ""The last match for the All Blacks, who won the trophy twice, was played in the second round. The last match in the series was at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, where the Springboks defeated Australia.""

Therefore, the match at Ellis Park was between South Africa (Springboks) and Australia.
"
Sadinno nga agay-ayam ti Springboks iti sumaruno nga ay-ayamda?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Daydiay ti maudi a laban para iti All Blacks, a nangabaken iti tropeo dua a lawasen ti napalabas. Maangay ti maudi a laban iti serye iti Ellis Park **iti Johannesburg** inton sumaruno a lawas, a kaay-ayam ti Springbooks ti Australia.""

This directly indicates that the Springboks won their first game against Australia in Johannesburg.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nagrigatan ti space station bayat ti mission da?,"The correct answer is **B: Panagpatalinaed ti gyroscope**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Napagtalinaed ti station ti posisionna, iti laksid ti kaawan ti gyroscope..."" This means the gyroscope's malfunction was the primary issue affecting the station's position.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Panagtalinaed ti umno a distansia manipud kadagiti thruster:** While the thrusters were used to correct the position, the *initial* problem was with the gyroscope.
* **C: Panagyussuat ti jet:** This is a consequence of the problem, not the root cause. The jets were used to *correct* the position after the gyroscope malfunctioned.
* **D: Panangpasubli iti gagangay a garaw:**  While the ground control eventually restored the station's orientation, this was a result of the problem being addressed, not the problem itself.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti gandat ti mision ti space station?","The correct answer is **A: Panangbirok iti napukaw a gyroscope.**

The passage states: ""Napagtalinaed ti station ti posisionna, iti laksid ti kaawan ti gyroscope..."" (The station's position was stabilized due to the malfunction of the gyroscope...).  The entire context revolves around the gyroscope problem. The other options are related to actions taken *because* of the gyroscope issue, not the primary goal of the mission itself.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti kaso ti saan nga agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti lehislasion maipapan ti spam email ket nausar iti kaso.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Daytoy ti umuna a gundaway a nagun-od ti maysa a pannakaikeddeng a mausar ti lehislasion a napagbalin a linteg idi 2003 tapno malapdan ti naipadu nga email, wenno am-ammo a kas spam, manipud iti di dawdawaten a pannakaiwaras iti mailbox dagiti agus-usar.""  This directly confirms the use of the spam legislation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Naidarum dayta iti estado a nakaikabilan ti AOL:**  While the case was likely handled within a specific state, the passage doesn't state that the state *found AOL guilty*. It only mentions the case.
* **B: Naaramid ti kombiksion:** The passage doesn't state that AOL was convicted. It only says a lawsuit was filed.
* **D: Naidarum ti AOL:**  The passage implies AOL responded to the complaints, but it doesn't explicitly say they were found guilty or ruled against.
"
Ania kadagtii sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw ti kaso?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti AOL ket naidarum iti saan a naipalubos a panangiwaras (AOL was accused of unsolicited sending)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Virginia case was about AOL being accused of sending unsolicited emails (spam) to its users. This directly relates to option A.
* Option C (the case was filed in 2003) is mentioned in the context of the law used, but it's not the core accusation against AOL.
* Option B (the case involved two major internet service providers) is not mentioned in the passage.
* Option D (AOL initiated the lawsuit) is incorrect; the passage says AOL *responded* to the complaints.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the essence of the case is that AOL was accused of sending unsolicited emails.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a club ti nangrugian nga inay-ayam ti Vidal tallo a season ti napalabasen?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The question asks where Vidal played *before* joining Barça. The passage states: ""Iti 28 ti tawenna a ni Vidal ket simmali iti Barça tallo a tawen ti napalabasen, naggapu iti Sevilla."" This translates to: ""At 28 years old, Vidal joined Barça three years ago, coming from Sevilla.""
"
Mano nga ay-ayam ti naay-ayam ti Vidal para ti Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""ni Vidal ket nagay-ayam ti 49 nga ay-ayam para iti klab."" which translates to ""Vidal has played 49 games for the club.""
"
Siasino ti kalaban a grupo iti ay-ayam?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The passage states: ""Agtaltalinaed isuna idiay pagdagusan ti team sakbay iti laban a naplano para Domingo kontra iti **Bolonia**."" which translates to ""He is training with the team in preparation for the match planned for Sunday against **Bolonia**.""

Therefore, Bolonia is the opposing team.
"
Apay a nagtalinaed ni Jarque iti hotel?,"The correct answer is **A: Nagsanay isuna.**

The passage states: ""Agtaltalinaed isuna idiay hotel sakbay ti naiplano a salip para iti Domingo laban iti Bolonia."" This translates to ""He is staying at the hotel in preparation for the planned meeting for Sunday against Bologna.""  Since he's staying at the hotel *in preparation* for the game, and the previous sentence mentions he was training, the most logical inference is that he's staying at the hotel to **train**. While he's also attending a meeting, the context points to training as the primary reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Adda ti pre-season a mitingna (He has a pre-season meeting):** While a meeting *might* be part of the preparation, the passage doesn't explicitly state this is the reason for being at the hotel.
* **C: Adda ti ay-ayamna idi Domingo (He has a wedding on Sunday):**  The passage mentions a game against Bologna, not a wedding.
* **D: Agsan-sanay isuna kadua ni Bolonia (He is training against Bologna):** The passage says he's preparing for a game *against* Bologna, not training *with* them.



"
Apay a saan a nangipaay ti pakdaar ti ahensia ti geophysics ti Jakarta?,"The correct answer is **D: Saanna a nasabat ti kasapulan a magnitude para kadagiti gingined (It did not reach the required magnitude for a tsunami).**

Here's why:

The first sentence of the paragraph states: ""segun iti ahensia ti geophyisics ti Jakarta, awan ti pakdaar ti tsunami a mairuar gapu ta saan a nadanon ti ginggined ti 6.5 magnitude"" which translates to ""according to the Jakarta geophysics agency, there was no tsunami warning issued because the earthquake of magnitude 6.5 was not strong enough.""

This directly supports option D.  The other options are not mentioned or implied in the text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti naigapu ti ginggined?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a 6.5 iti pagrukodan ti magnitude**.

The passage states: ""...segun iti ahensia ti geophyisics ti Jakarta, awan ti pakdaar ti tsunami a mairuar gapu ta saan a nadanon ti ginggined ti **6.5 magnitude**."" 

Therefore, the magnitude of the earthquake is explicitly mentioned as 6.5.
"
Ania kadagitoy ti mangparnuay ti aktibidad iti Init ken amin a bituen?,"The correct answer is **D: Karaniag ti silaw, Rossby a bilang, ken rotasion**.

Here's why:

* **Karaniag ti silaw (Surface Emission):** This is a fundamental aspect of stellar activity. Variations in surface emission directly relate to energy output and magnetic activity.
* **Rossby a bilang (Rossby Number):**  As stated in the passage, the Rossby number is linked to plasma activity and the likelihood of magnetic reversals, which are key drivers of stellar activity. A low Rossby number indicates less activity.
* **Rotasion (Rotation):** Stellar rotation is crucial for generating magnetic fields and influencing the dynamics of plasma within the star. The faster the rotation, the more complex and often more active the magnetic field becomes.

While options A, B, and C contain some correct elements, option D encompasses all the major factors mentioned in the passage that contribute to stellar activity.  The passage explicitly states that Rossby number and rotation are relevant to understanding stellar activity, and it implicitly links surface emission to overall activity.



"
Kasano a maamiris ti Rossby a bilang ti bituen?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti kaadu ti plasma flow**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Panagrikusda ken kinaraniag tapno maammuan ti Rossby a numero ti maysa a bituen, a mainaig iti agus ti plasma."" This directly links the Rossby number to plasma activity.
* **Rossby Number and Plasma Flow:** The Rossby number is a measure of the importance of Coriolis forces in a stellar dynamo. These Coriolis forces are directly related to the flow of plasma within the star. A higher plasma flow generally leads to a smaller Rossby number, indicating a more active star.
* **Why other options are less correct:**
    * **A: Karaniag ti silaw ken rotasion:** While luminosity and rotation *influence* stellar activity, they are not the *direct* factors determining the Rossby number.
    * **C: Ti lebel ti aktibidad:**  Level of activity is a *result* of the Rossby number, not the cause.
    * **D: Ti kaadu dagiti magnetic reversal:** Magnetic reversals are a consequence of the stellar dynamo process, which is influenced by the Rossby number, but not the direct cause of it.



Therefore, the amount of plasma flow is the most direct influence on the Rossby number.



"
Ania a porsiento ti tattao a nasurbey ti mangsuporta ti Australia nga agbalin a republika a dagus?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 a porsiento**.

The question asks about the percentage of people who think Australia *should* become a republic in the *near future*. The text states: ""An agsinnumbangir a maudi a panagbutos, **29 porsiento kadagiti nadamag ket mamati a masapul nga agbalin a republika ti Australia iti nadaras a panawen**..."" (In the last poll, 29 percent of those surveyed think Australia needs to become a republic in the near future...)
"
"Segun ken ni Julie Gillard, kaano a kasapulan nga agbalin a republika ti Australia?","The correct answer is **B: Kalpasan ti panagturay ni Reyna Elizabeth II**.

The passage states: ""Imbaga ni Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard idi kampania para iti pederal nga eleksion idi 2010 a mamati isuna a masapul nga agbalin ti Australia a republika inton malpas ti panagturay ni Reyna Elizabeth II."" (Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed it was necessary for Australia to become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.)
"
Ania nga organisasion ti madama a legal a maim-imbestigaran?,"The correct answer is **C: Planned Parenthood**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Komen Foundation *disqualified* Planned Parenthood from receiving funding due to an investigation. It also details Representative Cliff Stearns' investigation into Planned Parenthood's spending and reporting. Therefore, Planned Parenthood is the organization being investigated.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti House Energy and Commerce Committee:** This is a committee that *conducted* the investigation, not the organization being investigated.
*   **B: Ti Komen Foundation:** The Komen Foundation *disqualified* Planned Parenthood, but wasn't the subject of the investigation.
*   **D: Ti Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee:** This is the subcommittee led by Representative Stearns that conducted the investigation, not the organization being investigated.



"
Ni Cliff Steams ket ti mangidadaulo ti ania a komite?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee**.

The text states: ""madama ti panagimbestigar ni Stearns no dagiti buis ket maus-usar a pangpondo kadagiti aborsion babaen ti Planned Parenthood **gapu ta isu ti tserman ti Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, nga idadauluan ti House Energy and Commerce Committee**.""

While he chairs the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, the question asks which committee he *leads*. The text explicitly states he leads the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan a napasamak iti babai a Swiss?","The correct answer is **A: Naisubli dagiti natakaw a tagikuaenna**.

The text states that the Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone. This implies the items were returned to the Swiss woman. The other options are not supported by the provided text.
"
Ania a kompania ti nagunggonaan ti Taiwan Sustainable Award idi 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...napartakton ti panagduduma ken panagbalbaliw ti panaglako ken panaggatang iti laptop a kumpiuter kalpasan a nakaawat ti ASUS iti pammadayaw manipud iti 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award ti Executive Yuan ti Republika ti China.""
"
Ania ti ASUS Eee PC?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa a laptop**.

The text explicitly states ""Ti ASUS Eee PC...ket nagbalin a napudot a pakasarsaritaan idiay 200 Taipei IT Month."" and refers to it as a ""laptop a kumpiuter.""
"
Siasino ti akin-rebbeng kadagiti mapukpukaw a postal a dokumento?,"The correct answer is **C: Maysa nga ubing a lalaki**.

The text states: ""iti ubing a lalaki ket nangilemmeng iti agsurok 600 a dokumento iti koreo..."" which translates to ""a young man stole approximately 600 documents from the post office...""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti nagpakawan maipapan kadagiti mapukpukaw a dokumento?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti lokal a residente (Local residents)**.

The passage states: ""Nangrugi iti isyu idi Enero 1 idi adu a lokal a residente ti nangrugi nga agreklamo..."" which translates to ""The issue began on January 1st when many local residents began to complain...""

The passage also mentions the post office *after* the problem was discovered. The residents were the ones *initiating* the complaints.
"
Kaano a kasapulan a sanguen ni Del Potro ti parikutna iti abagana?,"The correct answer is **B: Sakbay ti immuna a panangburak iti panagpadada**.

The question states: ""Naabak ni Murray iti immuna a set bayat ti panangburak iti panagpadada..."" This directly indicates that Murray won the first set at the end of the tiebreak. Therefore, Del Potro needed to win the first tiebreak to win the first set.
"
Ania ti resulta ti umuna a tie break?,"The correct answer is **A: Naabak ni Murray iti umuna a set**.

The passage states: ""Naabak ni Murray iti immuna a set bayat ti panangburak iti panagpadada..."" which translates to ""Murray won the first set by tie-break...""
"
"Kas naisaad iti mabasa, siasino, iti partikular, ti naiwarnak iti pasiente?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti ubbing**.

The text states: ""Ita nga aldaw, naammuantayo a dagiti dadduma nga ubbing nga agtawen iti kas kadagiti ages-eskuela ti naaddaan iti kontak iti pasiente."" (Today, we learned that other children who are school-aged have had contact with the patient.)"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a kasiguraduan ti saan nga inaramid ti gobernador idi sinangona dagiti umili ti Texas?","The correct answer is **D: Saan a serioso ti kasasaad.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states, ""Serioso daytoy a kasasaad.""  This means the governor *did* say the matter was serious.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nasayaat ti panagtrabaho ti sistema:** The governor *did* say the system is ""nasayaat ti panagobrana a kas maiparbeng"" (functioning well).
* **B: Dagiti banbanag a maar-aramid tapno masalakniban ti talged ti publiko:** The governor *did* say they were ensuring ""dagiti umili ti Texas nga addan dagiti maar-aramid nga addang tapno masalakniban ti talged ti publiko.""
* **C: Nakasaganada a tapno masango ti karit:** The governor *did* say there are places around the world ""a nakasagana tapno masango ti karit nga ited daytoy a kaso.""

Therefore, the only option that directly contradicts something the governor *did* say is D.
"
Ania a news parody source ti inaramid ti dua a dati nga estudiante ti UW?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti Onion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nabayag pay sakbay ti The Daily Show ken ti The Colbert Report, nasirmata da Heck ken Johnson ti maysa a publikason a mamagbal;in a parodia iti damdamag—ken iti panagireport iti damag—idi estudianteda pay laeng iti UW idi 1988.

"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti saan a nairaman iti The Onion nga imperio ti parodi a damdamag?","The correct answer is **B: Maysa a pelikula**.

The passage specifically mentions:

*   Naiprinta nga edision
*   Maysa a website
*   24 oras a news network
*   Podcasts
*   Maysa a nabiit pay a world atlas a maawagan iti Our Dumb World

A movie is not listed as part of The Onion's empire. Therefore, the answer is B.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti guar-guardiaan ti pulis?","The correct answer is **C: Ti pagserrekan iti Downing Street**.

The passage states: ""Nangrugi ti protesta iti 11:00 oras a lokal (UTC+1) idiay Whitewall bangir ti pagserrekan a naguardiaan ti polis a mapan idiay kalsada ti Downing..."" This directly indicates that the police were guarding the road to Downing Street.
"
Ania nga oras a kiniddaw dagiti pulis dagiti protestante nga umakar tapno maliklikan ti ad-adda panagbattag ti trapiko?,"The correct answer is **D: Idi 11:20**.

The passage states: ""At 11:20, police charged the protesters who were blocking the pavement, telling them they needed to balance their right to protest with the need to keep traffic moving.""
"
Ania ti agpaypayso maipapan ti sukisok nga inaramid ni Dr. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti resulta ket mabalin a makabenepisio kadagiti pasiente nga addaan ti agdama a Type 1 a diabetes.**

Here's why:

* The text states Dr. Ur *doubts* that the findings can lead to a cure for Type 1 diabetes. 
* However, the statement ""Dagiti resulta ket mabalin a makabenepisio kadagiti pasiente nga addaan ti agdama a Type 1 a diabetes"" (The results could benefit patients with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes) is the only option that aligns with the potential positive outcome mentioned in the text, even if Dr. Ur is skeptical about a full cure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti sumagmamano a diabetic a bao ket saanen a diabetic:** This is directly contradicted by the first sentence, which states the baby *was* diabetic.
* **C: Positibo isuna a dagiti natakuatan ket mabalin a makaiyawat ti agas:** Dr. Ur *doubts* this. The text says ""pagduaduaanna"" (doubts).
* **D: Ti sumagmamano a saan a diabetic a bao ket diabetic itan:** This is the opposite of what the text says. The baby *was* diabetic.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti pagduaduaan ni Dr. Ur?","The correct answer is **A: No dagiti natakuatan ket napateg para kadagiti tattao nga addaan ti Type 1 a diabetes.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Kas iti dadduma nga eksperto, pagduaduaanna no mabalin a maagasan ti diabetes, napaliiwna a dagitoy a duktal ket awan pakainaiganna kadagiti tattao nga addaan iti Type 1 a diabetes."" 
* This means Dr. Ur doubts whether the concerns about reversing diabetes are relevant or important for people *with Type 1 diabetes*. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: No posible ti agas:** While Dr. Ur questions the possibility of reversing diabetes, the core of his doubt is about its relevance to Type 1 diabetics, not the possibility of reversing it in general.
* **C: Dagiti opinion dagiti dadduma pay nga eksperto maipapan ti agas:** The text doesn't mention other experts' opinions. Dr. Ur is expressing his own doubt.
* **D: No ti saan a diabetic a bao ket agtalinaed a kasdiay:** This is irrelevant to Dr. Ur's statement about Type 1 diabetes.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a manganninaw ti pannakadungpar ti Flight CG4684?,"The best answer is **A: Ti eroplano ket orihinal a saan a makadisso gapu ti panawen (The plane was originally unable to land due to weather).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Agarup sangapulo a minuto sakbay ti panagdisso daytoy iti maikadua a panangpadasna idi nagpukaw daytoy. Nasarakanda ita nga aldaw ti lugar a nakatnaganna ket narigat unay a mastrek isu a impatinnagda ti dua a polis iti kabakiran tapno magmagnada a mapan iti lugar ket birokenda dagiti nakalasat.""  This indicates weather conditions prevented the initial landing attempt.
* Option B is true, but it's a *consequence* of the weather, not the *cause* of the initial landing failure. The difficult-to-reach location is a result of where the plane *was* forced to land.
* Option C is irrelevant. The number of attempts doesn't explain *why* the plane couldn't land.
* Option D is partially true (searching was delayed by weather), but the *primary* reason for the initial failure was the weather itself preventing the landing.

Therefore, the weather is the fundamental reason the flight couldn't land in the first place.
"
Ania ti gapu ti panangibabawi ti Flight CG4684 ti panagdissona?,"The correct answer is **A: Saan a madanon ti lugar a pagdissuan (Unfavorable landing site)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Naisardeng ti panagsapul gapu iti isu met laeng a madi a panawen a nakaigapuanan ti saan a natuloy a panagdissona."" This translates to ""The search and rescue operation was launched only because of the unfavorable landing site that prevented the flight from completing its landing.""

This directly indicates that the reason for aborting the landing was the difficult landing conditions.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti kapadasan ni Franciszek Kowal ti agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Nadunor isuna bayat ti panagpadasna a bittaken ti tawa.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maysa kadagiti sarming ti nadadael, ket nangrugida a rummuar iti tawa,” kinuna ti nakalasat a ni Franciszek Kowal.” This translates to: ""One of the demons that was defeated, started to emit laughter,"" said the aged Franciszek Kowal.""  This implies that Kowal's experience of witnessing the ""macabre"" (a disturbing or horrifying event) *led to* his perception that laughter could be a weapon against the demons. He wasn't simply reminiscing about being able to make people laugh; he was speaking about the effect of the demons' defeat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naimatonanna a mabittak ti tawa:** (His awareness that he could make people laugh) - The passage doesn't mention him *being able* to make people laugh.
*   **B: Saan a nadunor isuna iti kamaudiananna:** (He wasn't aged later) - While the passage calls him ""aged"" (nakalasat), it doesn't say he *wasn't* aged later.
*   **C: Nangperdi isuna ti tugaw bayat ti panagruarna:** (He lost his voice during his ordeal) - The passage doesn't mention him losing his voice.



"
Apay a narigat a marukod ti mabalin nga epekto ti Bagyo a Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Adayo nga ag-landfall ti bagyo (The storm is far from landfall)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Agipud ta adayo pay a sumanglad ti bagyo, agtalinaed a narigat a maibaga ti mabalin nga epektona iti Estados Unidos wenno iti Caribbean"" which translates to ""Because the storm is still far away, it is difficult to predict its potential effects on the United States or the Caribbean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti bagyo ket naipadles nga agbalin a napigsa a bagyo (The storm has intensified into a tropical storm):** The text mentions its wind speed but not its intensification.
*   **B: Dagiti sientista ket saan a sigurado maipapan kadagiti masustenar nga angin ti bagyo (Scientists are not sure about the storm's sustained winds):** The text mentions its wind speed. The uncertainty isn't about sustained winds, but about *predicting the effects* because of its distance.
*   **D: Ti bagyo ket adayo unay iti Miami (The storm is very far from Miami):** The text says it's approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, but the key point isn't just the distance; it's the *implication* of that distance.

Therefore, the difficulty in predicting the storm's effects is directly linked to its distance from potential landfall.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti Bagyo a Danielle ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **A: Saan nga ammo ti epektona iti Caribbean**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Agriat a narigat a maibaga ti mabalin nga epektona iti Estados Unidos wenno iti Caribbean."" This translates to ""It is difficult to predict the potential effects on the United States or the Caribbean.""  Therefore, the effects on the Caribbean are currently unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nabuo daytoy iti Atlantic Ocean:** The text explicitly says Danielle formed in the North Atlantic Ocean.
* **C: Mabalin nga agbalin a napigsa a bagyo:** While not explicitly stated, the passage mentions Danielle had a wind speed of 40mph, indicating it *could* strengthen.  It's not something the text says *cannot* happen.
* **D: Asideg ti panag-landfallna:** The text states Danielle is still far from Miami, Florida, indicating it hasn't made landfall. It doesn't say it *cannot* make landfall.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti naikalikagum ti kasapulan a mapasamak iti sakit sakbay a mangigapu ti sangalubongan nga epidemia?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti sintomas ket masapul nga agtalinaed a saan unay a nakaru**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Adda pakaseknan a dagiti pasiente ket amangan no agtultuloyda a makaakar iti ad-adu pay a tattao babaen iti inaldaw-aldaw nga ar-aramidda no dagiti sintomas ti trangkaso ket agtalinaed a saan a nakaro."" 

This translates to: ""There is a study that suggests patients can continue to infect many more people through their daily activities if the flu-like symptoms remain mild.""

This directly supports option B. The passage emphasizes that the continued presence of mild symptoms allows for the spread of the virus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Masapul a makissayan ti kinakarona a makapatay (It is necessary to believe that it is a deadly coronavirus):** The text says the virus *isn't* deadly in the global epidemic and not causing severe illness in the initial cases.
* **C: Adu a tattao ti masakup a maimpeksionan (Many people will be infected):** While the virus *can* spread, the main point here is the importance of mild symptoms enabling *continued* spread, not simply a large number of infections.
* **D: Masapul a mapadasan dagiti ubbing dagiti sintomas (It is necessary to treat children's symptoms):**  The text doesn't mention the need to treat symptoms. It focuses on the impact of *mild* symptoms.

"Segun iti mabasa, kasano kaadayo ti bagyo manipud ti Fujian?","The correct answer is **C: 70 a kilometro**.

The text explicitly states: ""ti mata ti Morakot ket agarup pitopulo a kilometro ti kaadayona manipud ti probinsia ti Tsina a Fujian.""  This translates to ""the eye of Morakot is approximately seventy kilometers away from the Fujian province of China.""
"
Siasino ti nangkablaaw ken ni George W. Bush bayat ti panagsangpetna iti Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Da Wong Kan Seng ken Lee Hsien Loong**.

The text states that U.S. President George W. Bush met with Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Therefore, both of them are identified as having met with him during his trip to Asia.
"
Kaano nga insarita ti presidente ti maipapan ti panagpalawa ti negosio iti Asia?,"The correct answer is **A: Bayat ti panagsangpetna iti Singapore**.

The passage states: ""Kalpasan ti makadominggo a pannakaabak ti kagudua a termino nga eleksion, imbaga ni Bush kadagiti agbuybuya ti panangpalawa ti negosio idiay Asia."" This means he spoke about business growth in Asia *during* his visit to Singapore.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kadagupan a gandat ti gobierno?","The correct answer is **A: Pondoan ti ad-adu pay a carriage inton Marso ti daytoy a tawen**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the government **approved funding** (nangipaatiddag ti kari ti gobierno) in March to purchase vehicles. 
* It then mentions that 300 vehicles were acquired out of a goal of 1,300. 

Option A directly reflects the main point: the government's action was to **fund the purchase of more vehicles** in March.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mangala ti 300 a kadagupan a carriage** - While 300 were acquired, this doesn't represent the government's *overall goal* or action.
* **C: Mangala ti kanayonan a 1,300 a carriage** - This is the *target* but not the primary action taken by the government in March.
* **D: Mapabang-aran ti adu unay a tao iti carriage** - This is a *possible outcome* but not the government's stated purpose or action.



"
Ania ti inyanunsio ti gobierno?,"The correct answer is **C: Planoda ti mangpondo iti kanayonan a 1,300 a carriage**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Adda nainayon a 300 a namagbalin iti dagup a 1,300 a karuahe..."" (There are 300 available that totaled 1,300 carriages...).
* **The passage also states:** ""...ti kari ti gobierno a naaramid idi Marso daytoy a tawen tapno maikkan ti pondo ti nayon a karison."" (...the government's initiative in March this year to provide funds for the national army.)
* **Therefore, the government's announcement is to fund the total of 1,300 carriages.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Planoda a pondoan ti kanayonan a 300 a carriage:** The passage mentions 1,300, not 300.
* **B: Nakumikomda a mangbang-ar iti parikut iti carriage:**  This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Ti problemada iti adu unay a tao ket masolbar inton Marso:** While the government *initiated* something in March, the passage doesn't state the problem was *solved* in March.  It only states the initiative.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania nga impormasion ti ammo?","The correct answer is **A: Ti lebel ti pangta ket nakissayan (The level of the peggad is known)**.

Here's why:

The quote states: ""Awan ti amin a peggad"" (There is not all peggad). This implies that *some* peggad exist and can be measured.  Therefore, the level of the peggad is known, even if it's not the entire amount.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Awanen ti aniaman a pangta (There is no peggad):** This is the opposite of what the quote implies.
* **C: Manamnama ti maysa nga panangraut (An attack is hoped for):** The quote discusses the *outcome* of an attack (a decrease in the peggad level), not the expectation of an attack.
* **D: Pinasingkedan ti Intelligence a nakaro ti panangraut (Intelligence was alerted to an attack):**  The quote doesn't mention intelligence or any prior knowledge of an attack.



"
Ania a keddeng maipapan kadagiti protesta ti saan nga agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti protesta ket nagdemanda ti panagikkat ti napalabas a CEP.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Dagiti narungsot maminsan a protesta ket gapu iti pannakapaay a makaaramid iti eleksion, dadduma ket manipud pay idi 2011.""  This directly indicates the protests were demanding a change to the previous CEP.
* Option A is partially true - the commission *is* a response to the protests. However, the *demand* of the protests isn't just for a response, it's for a change to the CEP itself.
* Option B is incorrect. The protests were *about* the elections, not *caused by* the elections.
* Option D is true - the protests were sometimes violent. But it doesn't address the *reason* for the protests.



Therefore, **C** best captures the central reason for the protests according to the provided text.



"
Siasino ti nangikalikagum nga agikkat ti napalabas a CEP?,"The correct answer is **A: Ni Martelly**.

The passage states: ""P: Pinagsapata ni Martelly idi kalman ti baro a Provisional Electoral Council (CEP)..."" This directly indicates that Martelly appointed the new CEP. The passage also mentions that the new CEP was a response to protests, but Martelly initiated the appointment.
"
"Segun iti keddeng, ania ti saan a supsuportaran ti USA Gymnastics kalpasan ti panagabuso ni Nassar kadagiti atleta?","The correct answer is **A: Desertipikasion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Suportaran ti USA Gymnastics ti independiente nga imbestigasion...a saan ket a panangikkat iti sertipikasion.""  This means they *do not* support certification as a solution. The passage *does* support organizational changes, independent investigation, and addressing abuse.
"
"Segun iti keddeng, ania ti kangrunaan a gandat ti USA Gymnastics ken ti United States Olympic Committee para ti pagannayasanda?","The correct answer is **D: Panangitandudo ti natalged a lawlaw para kadagiti atleta.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...ti mamagbalin iti isport a gymnastics, ken dadduma pay, a natalged para kadagiti atleta tapno magun-odda ti arapaapda iti natalged, positibo ken napabileg nga aglawlaw."" (to make the sport of gymnastics, and others, safe for athletes so they can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and resilient way.)

While the passage mentions the Larry Nassar abuse investigation (A) and independent investigations (C), these are *means* to achieve the ultimate goal of athlete safety.  The passage *rejects* continuing certifications (B) as a solution. Therefore, athlete safety is the overarching and primary goal.
"
Sadinno a mapan ti barko idi napasamak ti insidente? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text states: ""Mapan iti Puerto Princesa idiay Palawan."" which translates to ""Sent to Puerto Princesa in Palawan.""
"
Ania ti saan nga agpaypayso maipapan ti barko a naisaad iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **C: Daytoy ket mine countermeasures a barko**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states the ship is a class of Avenger-class destroyer.**  Destroyers are multi-purpose warships, but the text *doesn't* say it's specifically a mine countermeasures vessel.
* **The text confirms the ship was deployed to Puerto Princesa.** (Option A is incorrect)
* **The text confirms the ship is based with the 7th Fleet.** (Option D is correct)
* **The text doesn't say the ship is based in Palawan.** (Option B is incorrect)

Therefore, the only statement *not* confirmed in the text is that the ship is a mine countermeasures vessel."
Siasino ti nangipatulod ti keddeng maipapan kadagiti tropa ti US?,"The correct answer is **A: Ni Donald Trump**.

The text states: ""Idi rabii ti Domingo, ti Presidente ti Estados Unidos a ni Donald Trump, iti saona a naiyebkasna babaen ti press secretary..."" (On Sunday night, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, announced...)

Therefore, Donald Trump was the one who announced the withdrawal of US troops.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a pagilian ti nakin-rebbeng ti panag-guardia kadagiti balud a tagalaban?","The correct answer is **A: Syria**.

The text states that the US withdrawal is from *Syria* and that Turkey will ""monitor the remaining ISIS fighters *in Syria*.""
"
Ania ti patienda a gapu ti pannakadungpar?,"The correct answer is **D: Madi a panawen (Bad weather)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maigagumaan a biroken ti nakapasamakan ti aksidente gapu ta dakes ti paniempo ken narigat a pagdaliasatan ti lugar."" This translates to: ""The rescue efforts were hampered due to heavy rain and difficult access to the area.""

Therefore, ""madi a panawen"" (bad weather) is the reason for the difficulty. The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
Ania a tipo ti daga a napasamak ti pannakadungpar?,"The answer is **A: Nauyong (Mountainous)**.

The text mentions the difficulty in reaching the crash site due to ""narigat a pagdaliasatan ti lugar"" (difficult to access the area). This strongly suggests a mountainous terrain.
"
Ania dagiti namnamaen dagiti mangituray a resulta ti layos?,"The correct answer is **D: Ad-adu pay a paggianan dagiti naatap nga animal (More habitats for aquatic animals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the flood impacted wetlands and beaches, leading to the washing away of rooftops.  It also mentions the impact on fish populations. The passage concludes by stating that officials hoped to restore the submerged land beneath the dam. This implies the hope was to *increase* habitat availability for aquatic animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti pannakaurnos dagiti penned (The destruction of pens):**  While possible, it's not the primary or explicitly stated outcome. The focus is on the larger environmental impact.
* **B: Ti pannakaaramid dagiti beach (The destruction of beaches):**  The passage mentions beach impacts, but the overall hope is to restore the land *underneath* the beach, not just to create more beaches.
* **C: Ti panagngato ti bilang dagiti humpback chubs (The increase in the number of humpback chubs):** The passage explicitly states that the flood affected the humpback chub population, and while restoration is hoped for, there's no direct prediction of an *increase* in their numbers.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti permanente nga apektaran ti pannakaaramid ti dam?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti buntuon ti darat (The land formations)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Napateg dagitoy nga arinsaed iti pannakaaramid dagiti namuntuon a darat..."" which translates to ""This action significantly impacted the existing land formations...""
* While the other options are affected, the passage highlights the *permanent* impact on the land itself as a core consequence. The land formations are still impacted even after the water level returns.
* Humpback chub are a species affected, but the passage doesn't say the impact is permanent.
* The ""flooding"" is the cause, not a permanent effect.
* The ""damaged roofs"" are a consequence of the flooding, but the passage focuses on the lasting impact on the land.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti nangiyawat ti intel iti Estados Unidos maipapan kadagiti posible nga panangraut?","The correct answer is **C: Maysa a saan a nainaganan a pammataudan (An unnamed source)**.

The passage states: ""U.S. received intel from a **non-attributable source**..."" This means the source's identity is not being revealed.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan kadagiti maipagarup a plano dagiti extremist a mangraut?,"The correct answer is **C: Agpasabong kadagiti bomba kadagiti dulon iti dua a pagilian**.

The statement explicitly mentions plans to target ""prominent public places"" in *both* Kenya and Ethiopia. Therefore, the plan involves bombings in *two* countries.
"
Siasino kadagiti sumaganad a tattao ti saan nga abogado?,"The correct answer is **D: Ni Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Petros Mantouvalos is a Member of Parliament and a lawyer.
*   Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are explicitly identified as lawyers.
*   Makis Triantafylopoulos is identified as a journalist. Therefore, he is not a lawyer.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
Ania a grupo ti tattao ti saan a naisaad a paset ti eskandalo iti uneg ti legal a komunidad ti Griego?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti solisitor**.

The text explicitly mentions that the scandal involved ""ukom, abogado, solisitor ken dagiti abogado"" (judges, lawyers, solicitors, and lawyers). While judges, lawyers, and lawyers are mentioned, **solicitors** are listed as a separate group involved, making them the group *not* specifically mentioned in the question's premise. Therefore, they are the answer to the question of who is *not* specifically mentioned.
"
Mano a wicket ti nakaabakan ti India?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The question states: ""kalpasan a maabakda **ti captain's wicket**..."". This means India lost a wicket *after* the captain's wicket, and the innings ended with 36 runs and 7 wickets down.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kangatoan a puntos dagiti inning?","The correct answer is **A: 70 a taray**.

The passage states: ""Nakaaramid ti kangatuan a puntos ni Robin Uthappa, 70 a taray..."" which translates to ""Robin Uthappa scored the highest score, 70 runs...""

While the team scored 36 runs in the latter part of the innings, the *highest* score of the innings was 70.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a gapu ti pannakakeltay ni Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **C: Saan a denggen ti Wales**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Adam Cuerden is concerned about the **legal reasons** for Wales' actions and their **perception** of it. He's worried about the negative impact on the site.
* The passage explicitly mentions that Wales is ""Rugrugi pay lang, agul-ulboden [kadatayo]"" (just starting, being aggressive) due to legal grounds and a perceived lack of understanding.
* Option C, ""Saan a denggen ti Wales"" (Wales is not understood), is a paraphrase of the reason Cuerden is concerned about the site's reputation. The passage indicates that Wales' actions are being misinterpreted.
* Option A, ""Ti baro a polisiya ti site maipapan ti seksual a linaon"" (The new site policy regarding sexual content), is mentioned in the passage as a reason for concern.
* Option B, ""Pannaka-ikkat ti artes iti Wales"" (The removal of art from Wales), is a direct reference to Wales' actions, which Cuerden is responding to.
* Option D, ""Ulbod maipapan iti makagapu iti pannakaikkat ti arte"" (Aggression regarding the removal of art), is another way to describe Wales' actions that are causing concern.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti naikkat manipud ti site?","The correct answer is **A: Art**.

The text states: ""Rugrugi pay lang, agul-ulboden [ni Wales] kadatayo. Umuna, babaen ti panangipakitana a legal a rason daytoy. Maikadua, babaen ti panagpammarangna a dengdenggennatayo, agingga a naikkat ti inaramidna nga art."" This directly translates to: ""Just starting, [Wales] is accusing us. First, based on his demonstration of legal grounds. Second, based on his perception that we've been ignoring it, until the art he made was removed.""



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a supsuportaran ni Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **A: Panangiraman kadagiti tagalaban a babbai iti Olympics**.

The passage explicitly states that Amir Khan said women ""shouldn't be allowed to compete"" and that this was ""infuriating"" to him. This directly contradicts supporting women's participation in the Olympics. He did, however, support British athletes in the 2012 Olympics.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti suportaranto ni Amir Khan malaksid ti personal nga opinionna?","The correct answer is **C: Ti 2012 nga Olympics**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nupay kadagiti komentona imbagana a suportaannanto dagiti mannakisalisal a Briton iti 2012 Olympics a maangay iti London."" This directly translates to: ""Despite his comments stating women can't fight, he praised the British boxers at the 2012 Olympics in London.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Dagiti babbai a tagalaban** - While his opinion was negative about women boxing generally, the passage doesn't say he supported female fighters *in general*.
*   **B: Dagiti kaduana manipud ti 2004 nga Olympics** - The passage mentions his opinion about Amir Khan's medal, but doesn't indicate support for female fighters from 2004.
*   **D: Dagiti dadduma pay a pirak ti medalyada** - There is no mention of supporting other medal winners.

"
Kaano a natay ni Peter Lenz?,"The correct answer is **A: Bayat ti warm-up a lap**.

The passage states: ""Ni Peter Lenz, maysa nga 13 a tawen a karerista iti motorsiklo, ket natay kalpasan a nairaman iti panagdinnungpar idiay Indianapolis Motor Speedway. **Bayat nga adda idiay warm-up lap**, natumba ni Lenz...""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kalpasan a natinnag isuna ti bisikletana** - The passage says he crashed *during* the warm-up lap, not after getting up.
* **C: Iti ospital** - He died as a result of the accident, not in the hospital.
* **D: Bayat a kaduana ti on-track a medikal nga empleado** - The passage doesn't mention the medical team being present at the time of the accident.



"
Siasino ni Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa pay a kumarkarera (Another racer)**.

The text states that Peter Lenz crashed and was hit by another racer, Xavier Zayat. This implies that Xavier Zayat is also a motorcycle racer. The text also explicitly states he was racing.
"
Iti ania a kasasaad a posible a magunggonaan ti madandanagan nga agtaytayab no maawatanna ti makin-uneg a panagandar ti eroplano?,"The best answer is **B: No ti aversion ti panagtayab ket nakasentro iti butengda ti saanda nga ammo.**

Here's why:

* **The question focuses on overcoming fear during turbulence.** The passage highlights that the fear of flying is often rooted in a lack of understanding and control.
* **Option B directly addresses this.**  If the fear is centered around unknown factors about the airplane's movements, addressing that lack of knowledge and providing clear explanations can help.
* **Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:**
    * **A: No ti pasahero ket mabain iti butengda:** While comfort can help, it doesn't address the core issue of understanding the turbulence itself.
    * **C: No ti pasahero ket nakaniwas kadagiti amin a tipo ti transportasion:** Previous travel experience doesn't necessarily negate the fear of flying; turbulence is a unique experience.
    * **D: No ti panagdanagda ket agtaud kadagiti makapadanag a pasamak a di nainaig iti panagtayab:**  This implies the fear is about unrelated events, not the turbulence itself.

Therefore, option B aligns most closely with the passage's premise that understanding and addressing the unknowns about flying is key to overcoming fear.



"
"Base iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti rumbeng nga aramiden ti maysa a agbi-biahe a sipapanunot iti presio?","The correct answer is **C: Mangiyasping kadagiti presio ti adu a kompania ti panagbiahe** (Compare prices from many travel companies).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ita a panawen, sumagmamano laengen ti agpareserba iti mismo nga airline para iti panagbiaheda a saanen a mangbirok ken mangkompara dagiti presio. **No maminsan, ti agpada met laeng a panagtayab ket adda dakkel a pagdumaan ti presio iti saba-sabali nga agregator ket nasayaat no ikompara ti search results ken iti panagbirok kadagiti website ti airline sakbay a mangiyurnos.**"" (Nowadays, many only book directly with the airline to avoid comparing prices. However, sometimes the same trip can have a big price difference between different aggregators, it's good to compare the search results and book directly on the airline's website when booking.)

Option C directly reflects this advice.  While other options are relevant, comparing prices across multiple companies/aggregators is the most emphasized strategy for finding the best deal.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti kasapulan nga umuna nga aramiden dagiti agbi-biahe tapno maala dagiti kamayatan a presio ti flight?","The correct answer is **C: Direkta nga ag-book iti airline**.

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes that booking directly with the airline is the best way to avoid price discrepancies and ensure you're getting the most accurate price. It states that while aggregators are good for *searching*, comparing with the airline's website is crucial. The text also mentions that sometimes prices on aggregator sites can be different, and it's good to check directly with the airline.

Here's why the other options are less ideal:

*   **A: Kitaen ti website ti airline:** While important, it's presented as part of the *comparison* process, not necessarily the first step for finding the lowest price.
*   **B: Iyasping dagiti presion dagiti agduduma nga aggregator:** Aggregators are helpful for initial searches, but they are not always the most accurate or cheapest source.
*   **D: Direkta nga ag-book iti travel agent:** Travel agents can be useful, but they often add fees and may not always have access to the best deals. The text focuses on finding the best price *yourself*.



Therefore, the passage implicitly encourages direct booking with the airline after comparison shopping."
Kaano a kasapulan ti kadua a kumuyog iti delivery?,"The best answer is **C: No dagiti banbanag ket maipatulod kas mai-check a bagahe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti pamay-an laeng tapno makalasat a nadardaras ket ti panangipatulod kadagitoy kas nailista a bagahe."" (The only way to ensure timely delivery is to ship them as listed baggage.)
* **It then elaborates on the issues with air freight:** ""...dagiti dadduma a ruta ket mabalin nga alaenna ti mano nga aldaw a lumasat iti panagibaba ken customs."" (...on other routes it may take more than a few days for the delivery and customs.)
* **The question asks about the need for a second courier:** This implies a situation where standard delivery isn't sufficient.  Shipping as ""checked baggage"" is presented as the solution to ensure timely delivery.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: No dagiti banbanag ket naipatulod babaen ti air freight:** The passage highlights the *problems* with air freight, not how it affects the need for a second courier.
* **B: No mangusar ti kompania kadagiti bukodda nga eroplano:** This is mentioned as a possibility for *larger* companies and is not the primary focus of the passage's delivery problem.
* **D: No ti panangipaw-it ket iggem ti dakdakkel a kompania:**  This is a specific scenario mentioned, but the passage is focused on the broader issue of timely delivery and the importance of checking baggage, not just larger companies.



Therefore, **C** is the most direct and logically supported answer based on the provided text.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, no agpilpila ti Frequent Flyer nga airline iti alyansa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kasapulam a kitaen nga umuna?","The correct answer is **D: Ti airline a mabalin a manginayon kadagiti pribilehio**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that even if the initial sign-up fee is low, the value comes from the *potential* to earn and redeem rewards across the alliance.  Having an airline within the alliance that offers the best benefits (pribilehio) is key, as it maximizes the use of your points and status.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ti airline a mangidiay-diaya ti kaaduan a puntos:** While points are important, the passage highlights the *redemption* flexibility within the alliance, not just earning the most points.
* **B: Ti airline iti kadakkelan nga alyansa:** Alliance size isn't directly linked to individual benefits or earning potential.
* **C: Ti airline a masansan nga usarem para ti biahem:**  Frequent use is important, but the overall value is tied to the benefits offered by the airline within the alliance.



Therefore, option D best reflects the core message of the passage."
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti makaidiaya ti ad-adu a frequent flyer a puntos?","The correct answer is **B: Ti airline a masansan a nausarmo para ti biahem babaen ti agpada nga alyansa.**

Here's why:

The passage states that even if you choose an airline for its price, you can still earn and redeem points with other airlines within the same alliance.  The key is frequency of travel *with that airline within the alliance*. 

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maysa a sabali nga airline iti sabali nga alyansa:**  This is incorrect because points earned on one alliance generally *cannot* be redeemed on another alliance.
* **C: Ti airline a masansan a nausarmo para ti biahem iti sabali nga alyansa:** Same reason as A - alliance restrictions.
* **D: Maysa a sabali nga airline iti uneg ti agpada nga alyansa:** While technically possible, it's less likely to accumulate *more* points than using the airline you fly with most often *within* the alliance. Frequent flyer programs often reward loyalty to a specific airline.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate interpretation of the passage.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a pangrikna ti mabalin a madadael ti sobra a panaginum ti arak?","The correct answer is **C: Panagraman (Vision)**.

The text explicitly states: ""...mabalin a mangitunda ti pannakabulag..."" which translates to ""...can cause blindness..."".  Blindness is a direct effect on vision (panagkita/panagraman).

While other cognitive functions can be impaired by alcohol, the passage specifically mentions blindness as a possible consequence.
"
"Kas naisaad iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a makakissay kadagiti delikado nga epekto ti arak?","The correct answer is **B: Panaginum ti ilegal a naaramid nga arak**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Posible a peggadna ket ngumato no uminom ti alkohol nga ilegal a naaramid."" and then elaborates that illegal alcohol can contain dangerous contaminants like methanol.

While the other options relate to alcohol consumption, they are not directly mentioned as *causing* the dangerous effects described in the passage.
"
Sadinno a makita ti kangatoan a pateg ti tagikua iti Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Canal District**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ti entero a distrito ket naibilang nga UNESCO World Heritage Site para iti naidumduma a kultural ket historikal a pategna..."" This means the Canal District *is* where the outstanding architectural heritage is located.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iti aniaman a lugar a naidutok kas UNESCO World Heritage Site:** While the Canal District *is* a UNESCO site, the question asks where to *see* the outstanding architecture. The Canal District is the specific place.
* **C: Dagiti lugar a naikkat manipud ti Binnestad:** This is incorrect because the question asks about the *outstanding* architecture, which is specifically concentrated in the Canal District.
* **D: Dagiti lugar nga addaan ti historikal a pateg:** While the Canal District *has* historical significance, the question focuses on the *outstanding architectural heritage*.  Many places in Amsterdam have historical significance.



"
Apay a naibilang ti Canal District kas maysa a UNESCO World Heritage Site?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti historikal ken kultural a pategna (Its historical and cultural significance)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti entero a distrito ket naibilang nga UNESCO World Heritage Site para iti naidumduma a kultural ken historikal a pategna..."" which translates to ""The entire district has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its remarkable cultural and historical significance...""

While options B and D are true statements about the Canal District, they are not the *reason* it was designated a World Heritage Site. Option C is also true but less comprehensive than option A.  The designation is based on its overall historical and cultural importance.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mangpapateg ti panagbisita iti Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **A: Ti buya iti rabaw ti Tonle Sap**.

The passage states: ""Ti naliday a tangatang ti templo ken ti buya idiay dan-aw iti Tonle Sap ket mangaramid a makagungona ti panaguli ti turod.""  This translates to ""The ancient architecture of the temple and the **beauty of the water on Tonle Sap** make it a popular tourist destination.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panagbiahe babaen ti Angkor Pass:** While an Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple, it's not a *reason* people visit Phnom Krom. It's a requirement for visiting many temples in the area.
* **C: Panangkita ti Siem Reap:** Phnom Krom is located 12 km southwest of Siem Reap, but seeing Siem Reap isn't the primary draw of visiting Phnom Krom itself.
* **D: Ti biahe babaen ti balangay paapan ti dan-aw:**  While it's convenient to combine a boat trip on Tonle Sap with a visit to Phnom Krom, the beauty of the water is the *reason* the combination is appealing.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti maikasapulan kadagiti bisita tapno makastrek iti Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Panangala ti Angkor Pass**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti Angkor Pass ti kasapulam no umunegka iti templo isu a saanmo a liplipatan nga awiten dayta pasportmo no mapanka idiay Tonle Sap."" This means you need an Angkor Pass to visit Phnom Krom.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mangliklik iti maysa a turista a bisitaen ti Antartica?","The correct answer is **D: Limitado a pisikal a panaggaraw (Limited physical fitness)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""makasapul iti pisikal a kinasalun-at..."". This means a certain level of physical fitness is required to visit Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti nangina unay a gasto (The initial high cost):** While Antarctica trips are expensive, the text doesn't highlight cost as a *limiting factor* for tourists visiting.
* **B: Ti interes iti panangsukisok ti Ross Sea (Interest in exploring the Ross Sea):** The text mentions the Ross Sea as an area visited, but doesn't say it's a primary *limiting factor* for visiting.
* **C: Ti iskediul ti trabaho a mangpalubos ti panagbiahe iti Disiembre ken Enero (Work schedules that prevent travel in December and January):** The text says travel is *limited* to November-February, but doesn't connect this directly to work schedules as the main reason.



"
Ti maysa a turista nga interesado iti panaguli ti bantay ket mabalin a bumisita iti ania a paset ti Antartica?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Ross Sea**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sumagmamano a ribo nga agububra ket agtaltalinaed ditoy iti tag-init ti uppat a dosena a base kaaduan idiay a lugar; bassit laeng a bilang ti agbati no nalamiis. Ti makin-uneg a daga ti Antarctica ket maysa a lantag a langalang a saklawen ti 2-3 km a yelo. Dagiti sagpaminsan nga espesialista a tour ti tangatang ket agdissaag, para iti panaguli iti bantay wenno tapno mapan iti Pole, nga addaan ti dakkel a base.""

This indicates that specialized tours, including those for mountaineering, are possible. While the passage doesn't explicitly state the Ross Sea is *the only* location for mountaineering tours, it is one of the areas mentioned where these types of tours occur. The other options are either too general (Inland) or limited to specific areas (Peninsula, Islands).
"
Sadinno a saan unay a makita dagiti pre-modern observatory?,"The correct answer is **C: Iti adayo a lugar (In remote locations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that pre-modern observatories are now often found in museums or tourist spots because of light pollution. It further explains that modern telescopes are large and require areas with good atmospheric conditions. This implies that pre-modern observatories were likely located in remote areas *before* light pollution became a significant issue. 

Therefore, option C is the most logical answer.
"
Sadino ti posible a pakaikabilan ti moderno a teleskopio ti panagsukisok?,"The correct answer is **D: Iti maysa a dakkel a pasilidad (In a large facility)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kaaduan dagiti moderno a teleskopio a pangsarsarak ket dadakkel a pasilidad a nawada ti kundision ti atmospera."" (Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located where atmospheric conditions are favorable.)
* Options A, B, and C (museum, university campus, educational site) could potentially house telescopes, but the passage emphasizes that they are *large facilities* in specific locations for optimal atmospheric conditions, implying a dedicated, substantial structure.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a lugar ti kasayaatan para ti naulimek nga aldaw iti beach?","The correct answer is **B: Ti Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti aplaya idiay Tamaki Drive ket addada idiay Waitemata Harbour, idiay ngato ti palengke a kailian ti Mission Bay ken St Heliers idiay Central Auckland. **No maminsan ket mapuspusek ti pamilia dagitoy nga aplaya nga adda ti nasayaat a paggatangan a nakalinia iti igid baybay.**""

This indicates that Mission Bay, along with St Heliers, is a good place for families to spend a relaxed day at the beach *because* it has good facilities along the shoreline. The other options don't explicitly mention family-friendly facilities or a relaxed atmosphere.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno a katalgedan dagiti kondision ti panaglangoy?","The correct answer is **A: Ti Devonport**.

The text states: ""Dagiti aplaya iti North Shore (idiay distrito iti North Harbor) ket adda idiay Pacific Ocean ken agbennat manipud Long Bay idiay amianan agingga Devonport idiay abagatan."" and ""...dandanida amin a nadarat nga aplaya nga adda ti natalged a paglanguyan..."" This implies that Devonport is one of the beaches with good swimming conditions.

While Long Bay is also mentioned as the northernmost point, the statement specifically mentions beaches along that stretch having good swimming conditions, and Devonport is the southernmost point mentioned.  The other options (North Harbor District and Central Auckland) are too broad; the text specifies particular locations.
"
"Bayat ti panagbisita iti lugar a nailadawan iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maikonsiderar a saan a naannatup?","The correct answer is **B: Panagikabil ti marka sadinno man iti lawlaw ti site (Vandalism)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly states:** ""...Saanmo a dadaelen dayta lugar ti panangikabilmo ti marka wenno panagkarmot mo iti graffiti kadagita naipatakder."" This directly prohibits vandalism.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Panagbalin nga ulimek (Turning away/Disregarding):** While disrespectful, the prompt focuses more on *active* actions that would violate the site's dignity. Disregarding the significance isn't the main point being prohibited.
* **C: Panagangaw (Laughter/Mocking):** This is a disrespectful behavior, but the prompt's focus is broader – safeguarding the site's dignity and sanctity.
* **D: Panagkudkud ti istruktura (Destruction of structures):**  While damaging structures would be highly inappropriate, the prompt specifically mentions *marks* and *graffiti*, implying a prohibition on defacing the site, not necessarily destroying it.



Therefore, **B** is the most directly supported and relevant answer based on the prompt's explicit instructions.



"
Ania kadagitoy ti mangiladawan kadagiti lengguahe a lingua franca?,"The correct answer is **D: Organiko**.

Here's why:

The passage states that lingua francas can be ""gagangay wenno organiko a pagsasao nga agbalbalin a dominante.""  ""Organiko"" refers to something that develops naturally and organically, rather than being intentionally created or artificial.  A lingua franca arises naturally from the need for communication between speakers of different languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Artipisial** - This means artificially created, the opposite of how a lingua franca typically develops.
* **B: Saan a natural** - While a lingua franca isn't a ""natural"" language in the sense of being the primary native language of a group, ""organiko"" is a more accurate description of its development.
* **C: Naaramid** - This means manufactured or made, which suggests artificial creation.



"
Ania a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan kadagiti auxiliary a legguahe?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagita ket lengguahe a naaramid tapno mapasayaat dagiti kasasaad ti komunikasion**.

Here's why:

* **The definition of auxiliary languages (like Esperanto) emphasizes their *designed* nature.** They are *created* to facilitate communication between speakers of different languages. 
* **Option C directly reflects this:** ""Lengguahe a naaramid tapno mapasayaat dagiti kasasaad ti komunikasion"" translates to ""languages created to improve the effectiveness of communication.""  This aligns with the core purpose of an auxiliary language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isuda ket organiko a lengguahe a mausar tapno makikomunikar kadagiti tattao a mabalin a saan a makaawat ti maysa ken maysa** (""They are organic languages used to communicate with people who may not understand each other."") This is incorrect. Auxiliary languages are *not* organic languages. They are intentionally constructed. The reason they're created is specifically to help people *who don't understand each other* communicate, but the language itself is designed.
* **B: Dagita ket pagsasao nga agpada a natural ken naaramid** (""They are languages that are similar to natural and created."") While there's an element of both natural and created, it's not the defining characteristic. The *purpose* of being created is more important.
* **D: Dagita ket naaramid a lengguahe a kangrunaan kadagiti agsasao ti agduduma a lengguahe** (""They are created languages primarily for speakers of different languages."")  This is partially true but doesn't fully capture the *design* aspect. It focuses on the target audience but not the *creation* process.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan a kitaen ti pasahero iti barko iti panawen ti niebe?","The correct answer is **A: Lokasion ti cabin**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""No bumallasiw iti Makin-amianan a Baltic no panawen ti lam-ek, kitaen iti lugar ti kabin..."" This directly links the snowy conditions in the Northern Baltic to the location of the cabin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti kasapulan iti visa:** The passage mentions visa requirements, but it's about whether passengers *need* a visa, not what they should *see* on the boat during a snowy period.
* **C: Dagiti termino:** ""Termino"" is too general and not specifically mentioned in relation to what passengers should see.
* **D: Ti kaadu ti panawen a mabusbos iti ili:** While the passage mentions the limited time in the town (Saint Petersburg), it's not the primary thing a passenger should *see* on the boat during a snowy period. The focus is on the cabin location related to the snow.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, no ti biahe ti barko ti pasahero ket iti panawen ti kalgaw, ania ti mabalin a kasapulanda a liklikan?","The correct answer is **B: Panaglasat iti yelo (Ice Navigation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""No bumallasiw iti Makin-amianan a Baltic no panawen ti lam-ek, kitaen iti lugar ti kabin, gapu ta iti panagpagna iti yelo ket makingapu iti nakaro a tagari para kadagidiay maapektaran."" This translates to: ""In the northern Baltic during winter, the ice floes are visible in the cabin, because the ice formation poses a great threat to those affected.""

Therefore, traveling in the winter requires navigating ice. The other options are not directly related to the challenge mentioned in the text.

*   **A: Oras iti ili (Time in the port)** - While time in port is a factor for cruises, it isn't the primary concern related to winter Baltic travel as described.
*   **C: Dagiti kasapulan iti visa (Visa requirements)** - The passage explicitly states that passengers do not need visas, according to the passage.
*   **D: Saint Petersburg** - Saint Petersburg is just a location mentioned as a cruise destination. It's not a requirement to consider when traveling in winter.



"
Apay a masansan a mausar ti Catalan para kadagiti sinyal ken anunsio iti Barcelona,"The correct answer is **B: Daytoy ti umuna nga opisial a lengguahe ti siudad.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ngem kaadduan kadagiti karatula ket nakasurat ti Catalan gapu ta isu daytoy ti naipasdek iti linteg nga umuna nga opisial a pagsasao."" (But many signs are written in Catalan because it was established as the official language.)

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

* **A: Ad-adu ti makaawat ngem ti Espaniol:** While many people understand Spanish, the passage doesn't say this is the *reason* Catalan is used.
* **C: Daytoy ti maipangpangruna a lengguahe iti Barcelona:**  The passage implies Catalan is *official*, not necessarily the *most commonly spoken*. Spanish is still widely used.
* **D: Ti Metro ken dagiti dadduma pay a publiko a pasilidad ket masansan nga us-usaren dagiti umuli nga agsasao ti Catalan:** The passage states the Metro announcements are in Catalan, but also mentions automated systems in multiple languages. This doesn't explain *why* Catalan is used for signs and announcements generally.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a legguahe ti nausar ti sistema ti Metro iti Barcelona para kadagiti regular nga anunsio?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

The text states: ""Ti regular a pammakdaar idiay Metro ket maaramid laeng idiay Catalan..."" which translates to ""The regular announcements in the Metro are only made in Catalan...""

While the Metro system has automatic announcements in multiple languages, the *regular* announcements are specifically in Catalan.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a pagnam-ayan ti saan a nalabit nga ipangpangruna ti high end bed and breakfast?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti naidumduma nga antique a muebles (Memorable antique furniture)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...addaan pay iti aramid-ima nga abbong ti kama wenno antigo a kama."" ( ""...may even have antique beds or old beds""). This directly relates to memorable antique furniture. While the other options might be present in some high-end B&Bs, the passage highlights the antique furniture as a key element contributing to the overall experience, alongside the focus on food and the building's structure.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as accurate:

*   **A: Dagiti banbanag ti espesialidad iti menu (Specialty menu offerings):** While the passage mentions food, it focuses on regional and historical cuisine rather than a generally ""specialty"" menu.
*   **C: Dagiti nasayaat a namentenar nga espasio iti ruar (Well-maintained outdoor spaces):** The passage mentions a pool and landscaped grounds, but doesn't emphasize ""well-maintained"" outdoor spaces as a defining characteristic.
*   **D: Napartak a WiFi (Fast WiFi):** WiFi is a modern amenity and not mentioned in the passage as a focus of high-end B&Bs.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maysa kadagiti kangrunaan a puntos ti kompetision iti baet dagiti nangina a B&B?","The correct answer is **A: Kontemporario a dekorasion**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the main selling points of B&Bs are ""pagiddaan ken pammigat"" (accommodation and dining). It further emphasizes the historical and unique aspects of these offerings: antique beds, regional cuisine, and historical architecture.  ""Kontemporario a dekorasion"" (contemporary decoration) is not mentioned as a primary focus or distinguishing feature.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **B: Dagiti nadumaduma a seasonal breakfast offerings** -  The passage mentions ""naiimas a makan iti rehion iti dayta a panawen iti rehion"" which implies regional and possibly seasonal offerings.
* **C: Nangina a pagiddaan** - The passage specifically mentions ""arado-ima nga abbong ti kama wenno antigo a kama"" (antique beds).
* **D: Lokal a naala a makan ken mainum** -  The passage mentions ""naiimas a makan iti rehion"" and ""paglaingan a luto ti agsangaili"" (traditional dishes).

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maangay iti Beijing idi 2022?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti seremonia ti panaglukat** and **C: Dagiti seremonia ti panagserra** and **D: Dagiti pasamak iti yelo iti uneg ti kamarin**.

The text explicitly states that Beijing hosted the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the indoor ice events. The skiing events took place in the Taizicheng ski area, not in Beijing itself. Therefore, options B is incorrect.

Since the question asks for *which* of the options are *not* suitable for Beijing, and the passage says Beijing hosted the opening/closing ceremonies and ice events, we can infer that the ski events *were not* suitable for Beijing.

Therefore, the correct answers are A, C, and D.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti i-host ti Beijing idi 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti pasamak ti yelo a mapasamak iti uneg (Indoor ice events)**.

The passage specifically states: ""Beijing host the ceremonies of the opening and closing ceremonies and the **indoor ice events**.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti Olympics iti kalgaw (Winter Olympics)** - While true, this is too broad. The passage lists *specific* events hosted.
* **C: Ti Olympics iti panawen ti niebe (Snow Olympics)** - Similar to A, this is too broad.  While snow is involved, the passage details indoor ice events.
* **D: Dagiti pangserra a seremonia (Opening and closing ceremonies)** - While the passage mentions these, it's not the *only* thing Beijing hosted.
"
Siasino ti addaan ti kangatoan a peggad ti panagsakit ti avian influenza?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti empleado iti manukan (Employees of poultry farms)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kaaduanna nga inramanda dagiti tao nga agob-obra iti pagtaraknan ti manok..."" (Many cases have been reported in people who work on poultry farms...).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Dagiti birdwatcher (Birdwatchers):** While birdwatchers *could* be exposed, the passage doesn't specifically highlight them as a primary group at risk.
* **B: Dagiti tattao a makitar-tarabaho kadagiti mammal (People who work with mammals):** The passage focuses specifically on bird flu and its transmission from birds. There's no mention of mammal-related transmission.
* **D: Dagiti tattao a naimpeksionan idin (People who have been infected):** This is too broad. The question asks who is *at risk* of a fatal infection, not who has already contracted it.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti bird flu?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti birdwatcher ket adda ti peggad a maimpeksionan.**

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""Kaaduanna nga inramanda dagiti tao nga agob-obra iti pagtaraknan ti manok, ngem adda latta met sumagmamano a pagpeggadan dagiti agbuybuya iti bilbillit."" (Many cases have been reported in people who work on chicken farms, but there have also been a few cases in people who buy and butcher chickens.) This directly indicates that birdwatchers (who might handle birds) are at risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti laeng empleado iti manukan ti nakaala ti trangkaso** (Only chicken farm employees got the flu): The text says many cases are reported in chicken farm employees, but also in others (birdwatchers and those handling chickens).
* **B: Ad-adu a kaso ti naipadamag kadagiti tattao ngem kadagiti billet** (Many cases have been reported in people but not in chickens): The text says cases have been reported in both people *and* chickens.
* **D: Amin a kaso a naipadamag kadagiti tattao ket makapatay** (All cases reported in people are fatal): The text says the disease can be fatal, but only a small percentage of cases are fatal. It doesn't state *all* cases are fatal.



"
Ania ti ikonektar ti White Sea–Baltic Canal?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti Artic Ocean ken Baltic Sea**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti White Sea–Baltic Canal ket konektado iti Arctic ocean ken iti Baltic Sea..."" which translates to ""The White Sea–Baltic Canal is connected to the Arctic ocean and the Baltic Sea...""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, iti ania a tipo ti lugan ti mabalin a makolekta dagiti passport tapno saanen a masinga ti pasahero?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti mabalin a turugan iti rabii a tren**.

The passage specifically states: ""Dagiti tren a mabalin pagturogan iti rabii, mabalin a kolektaen ti konduktor dagiti pasaporte tapno saan a maistorbo ti panagturogmo."" (Trains that can be slept on at night, the conductor may collect passports so as not to disturb the sleeping.)

While the other options mention transportation methods, the passage only links passport collection to overnight trains.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a mabalin a mainspektar ti bukodmo nga ID iti sumagmamano a cross-border a tren?","The correct answer is **D: Iti agtar-taray a tren**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kadagiti dadduma a tren para iti panagballasiw iti border iti panag-inspeksiyon ket maaramid no madama nga agtartaray ti tren..."" This directly indicates that inspections happen on trains that are moving/operating.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti masansan a parikut bayat ti panagtalinaed kadagiti nangato a tropiko a lugar ti Singapore?,"The correct answer is **C: Pannakabannog manipud ti init (Protection from the sun)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Singapore's tropical climate means constant heat and humidity. 
* The question asks about common problems related to living in a tropical climate.
* **Protection from the sun** is a very common and direct problem associated with constant, intense sun exposure in tropical regions.  People need to protect themselves from sunburn, heatstroke, and other sun-related issues.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Matakawan (Pollution)**: While pollution can be a problem in Singapore, it's not *specifically* tied to the tropical climate itself.
* **B: Awan ti akses kadagiti paggatangan (Lack of access to water)**: Singapore has access to water, although water management is important. This is not a *common* problem *caused by* the tropical climate.
* **D: Pannakapukaw (Lack of sleep)**: While heat and humidity *can* disrupt sleep, it's not the *primary* or most common problem associated with living in a tropical climate.  Protection from the sun is a more direct and prevalent issue.



Therefore, the best answer reflecting a common problem tied directly to the described tropical climate in Singapore is protection from the sun.



"
Siasino ti mabalin a mayat a mangliklik iti pannangan kadagiti German a pastry?,"The correct answer is **A: Maysa a tao nga addaan ti nakaro nga allergy iti mani (Someone who has a severe allergy to nuts)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that many German pastries contain nuts like almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of whole nuts. Therefore, someone with a nut allergy would need to be cautious and perhaps avoid these pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Maysa a tao nga ipangpangrunana dagiti richer a dessert (Someone who primarily likes richer desserts):** The text mentions rich, fruity pastries and cakes, so someone who enjoys richer desserts *could* enjoy them.
* **C: Maysa a tao a saanna a kayat ti tsokolate (Someone who doesn't like chocolate):** The text doesn't mention chocolate as a common ingredient in German pastries.
* **D: Maysa a tao nga ipangpangrunana dagiti nasamit ngem ti nananam a raman (Someone who primarily likes simple but plain sweets):**  The text describes a variety of pastries, many of which are not simple or plain (e.g., almond cakes, cherry plum pastries).



"
Ania kadagiti laok ti maikonsiderar a base ti panawen nga elemento dagiti tinapay iti German?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti mansanas (Apples)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Adu a tinapay ti Aleman ti adda kadagiti mansanas a mailutluto kadagiti tinapay iti sibubukel a tawen..."" (Many German breads contain apples baked into them throughout the year...). The other options (hazelnuts, pears, and almonds) are mentioned, but apples are specifically highlighted as a prominent ingredient.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikalikagum a singasing para ti panagbiahe nga addaan ti budget?","The correct answer is **A: Agbirok kadagiti naisalumina a trabaho nga aramidem bayat ti panagbiahem (Finding low-cost jobs to do while traveling)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that those who sacrifice comfort, time, and expensive travel, can lower their budget by:

*   **Agtakaw kadagiti maiparit (Eating at cheap places)**
*   **Makikadua iti maiparit a negosio (Working at cheap businesses)**
*   **Agpalama (Offering services)**
*   **Manggundaway iti dadduma a tattao para iti bukodda a pagimbagan (Earning money from other people for their own livelihood)**

Finding low-cost jobs is a direct parallel to earning money through working or offering services. The other options are not mentioned or supported by the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti mabalin a marigatan iti panagbiahe no bassit laeng ti budget?","The correct answer is **A: Maysa a tao a mangpasangbay ti karit (Someone who is willing to be frugal)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the article focuses on how to travel on a *low* budget (""kababaan a badyet""). It highlights that people who are willing to make sacrifices (""agisakripisio ti gin-awa, oras ken mapadlesan a panagiduron ti gastos pababa agingga asideg iti awan"") can travel.  Therefore, someone who is frugal (mangpasangbay ti karit) is the type of person who can successfully navigate a tight budget.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Maysa a tao nga addaan kadagiti istrikto a limitasion iti oras (Someone with strict time limitations):** The passage doesn't directly link time limitations to budget travel.
* **C: Mays a tao nga agtar-tarabaho iti remote bayat ti panagbiahe (Someone who works remotely while traveling):**  While remote work can help offset costs, the main focus of the passage isn't on remote work itself, but on reducing travel expenses.
* **D: Maysa a tao a mangipapas a mangsurot iti itinerario (Someone who is flexible about their itinerary):** Flexibility can *help* save money, but it's not the core trait being emphasized in the context of a low budget.  The passage emphasizes being frugal.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagmaneho iti baet ti Point Marion ken Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **A: Adda dagiti adayo nga atiddog a dalan iti pagilian (There are long stretches of rural road).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:** ""narangkis unay a lugar, nailet a daldalan, ken natatadem a kurba ti kaaaduan"" (very rugged terrain, narrow roads, and numerous curves).  This points to rural roads.
* **Option A directly reflects this.**
* **Option B (Dagiti linia ket naet-et - Lines are narrow)** is mentioned in the passage as part of the road characteristics.
* **Option C (Dagiti limitasion ti kapartak ket manmano a masurot - Speed limits are manually enforced)** is *not* mentioned. The passage says speed limits are *lowered* in certain sections.
* **Option D (Ti serbisio ti cellphone ket saan a parikut - Cellphone service is not readily available)** is contradicted by the passage, which says ""napigpigsa ti serbisio ti mobile a telepono ditoy ngem iti adu a sabali a distansia ti ruta, kas pagarigan ti Pennsylvania Wilds"" (mobile phone service is reliable here but in many other distances of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds).



Therefore, option A is the best answer because it directly aligns with the information provided in the passage."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti kasapulan a kangrunaan a pakaseknan para kadagiti agmaneho nga agbiahe iti Buffalo-Pittsburg highway?","The correct answer is **C: Panagpilko iti napartak unay (Sharp maneuvering)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions: ""narangkis unay a lugar, nailet a daldalan, ken natatadem a kurba ti kaaaduan"" (very rugged terrain, winding roads, and steep curves). This directly translates to needing to be prepared for sharp maneuvering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makaupay ti nabattag a trapiko (Heavy traffic):** The passage states the area is known for ""naisinsina nga aw-away a daga"" (mountainous terrain) and doesn't mention heavy traffic.
*   **B: Awan ti naan-anay a cellular a serbisio (Poor cellular service):** While the passage says service is available in some areas, it doesn't say it's *poor* overall.
*   **D: Pannakasagang kadagiti masansan a trabaho iti dalan (Construction delays):** The passage doesn't mention construction delays.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a kasapulan tapno makarugi iti canyoneering?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti bassit a panagsanay (Basic training)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti kanyoning ket mangtiptipon dagiti elemento aggapu iti panaglangoy, panagkalay-at ken panagtapuak--ngem masapul ti bassit a panagsanaywenno kinaalibtak ti bagi tapno mangrugi (kumpara iti panagkalay-at iti bato, panagbatok iti scuba wenno ti panag-iski iti alpine, kas pagarigan).""

This directly indicates that basic training is required to start canyoneering.  While swimming, physical fitness, and agility are helpful, the passage specifically highlights *basic training* as a necessity.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kasapulan para ti naballigi a canyoning excursion?,"The correct answer is **D: Abilidad a makalangoy (Ability to swim)**.

Here's why:

* The provided text states that canyoning involves ""pananglangoy"" (swimming) as one of its elements. 
* While some experience in other activities (climbing, rappelling) is helpful, the text explicitly mentions swimming.
* Options A and B are too advanced for basic canyoning.
* Option C is not necessarily required for all canyoning excursions, especially beginner ones.

Therefore, the ability to swim is the most fundamental requirement mentioned in the text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti makatulong para ti maysa a tao nga agplan-plano nga agkampo iti luganda?","The correct answer is **A: Ti nasayaat a pannakaawat kadagiti limitasion ti lugan mo (Understanding the limitations of your car)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that choosing a car that's suitable for camping (large minivan, SUV, Sedan, or Station Wagon) is important. It also mentions that using your own car for travel is convenient but requires careful planning (""panagkampo"" - camping). Therefore, understanding your car's capabilities and limitations is crucial for planning a successful camping trip.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ti lugan a mangpalubos kadagiti tugaw a maitumba (A car that can accommodate fold-out beds)**: While potentially helpful, the text doesn't specifically mention fold-out beds. The focus is more on the overall size and capacity of the car.
* **C: Maysa a tolda (A tent)**: The text doesn't mention tents.
* **D: Maysa a pribado a tagikua a pagkampuan (A private campsite)**: The text discusses camping *with* your car, implying a more flexible approach than relying on pre-booked campsites.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan a liklikan dagiti agkampo iti lugan no mangkitkitada ti lugar a nalaka a mabirukan?","The correct answer is **A: Panagmaneho ti dakdakkel a lugan, kas ti SUV wenno minivan.**

The text states: ""Ti panagkampo ti lugan mabalin no adda iti dakkel a minivan, SUV, Sedan wenno Station Wagonmo nga agidda dagiti tugawna."" (Car camping can be done if you have a large minivan, SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon that can hold your gear.)  This implies that you need a larger vehicle to accommodate car camping.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panagbiahe iti nabaybayag (Traveling by air):** The text discusses *car* camping, not air travel.
* **C: Panagiyasmang ti tolda iti ili wenno iti pribado a tagikua (Setting up a tent in a town or private area):**  While setting up a tent *could* be part of car camping, the text focuses on the *vehicle* needed for car camping.
* **D: Saan a naruam iti lugan nga us-usarenda (Not entering the vehicle that will be used):** This is nonsensical in the context of car camping.

Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti nangaramid manen iti Casablanca iti maikadua a daras?","The correct answer is **D: Ti sultan ti Morocco**.

The text states: ""Siudad ket pinanagananna iti Daru I-Badya sa Casablanca ti impanagan dagiti negosiante nga Español a nakipatakder kadagiti paglakuan ditoy."" which translates to ""The sultan of Morocco made the city its capital in Daru I-Badya in Casablanca, to host Spanish merchants who traded in the region."" This indicates the Sultan of Morocco rebuilt Casablanca.

While the Portuguese initially impacted the city, the sultan is credited with its rebuilding.
"
Siasino ti pimmanaw iti moderno a siudad ti Casablanca kalpasan ti natural a didigra?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti Espaniol**.

The text states: ""Siudad ti Morocco ti impanagan dagiti negosiante nga Español a nakipatakder kadagiti paglakuan ditoy"" which translates to ""The city of Morocco was the capital of Spanish merchants who traded in the dealings there.""  This refers to the Spanish taking over Casablanca after the 1755 earthquake.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano a nakaala ti pannakaibigbig ti Sintra manipud kadagiti ganggannaet?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti positibo a nakuna ni Lord Byron**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Adda iti amianan ken nadaras a madanon ti romantiko ken makakayaw nga ili ti Sintra a nagbalin a nalatak kadagiti ganggannaet kalpasan ti panangisurat ni Lord Byron iti makaay-ayo a pannakailadawan ti kinapintasna."" This translates to: ""In the north, there is a charming and romantic town of Sintra that became famous to tourists after Lord Byron wrote a beautiful description of its beauty.""

Therefore, Lord Byron's positive description is what made Sintra famous.
"
Ania ti saan a nabigbig ti Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti baro a republika**.

The text states: ""Nupay kasta, awan ti nasion - uray pay ti Armenia - nga opisial a nagbigbig iti daytoy."" This translates to: ""However, even Armenia - still not an official recognition of it.""  ""It"" refers to the new republic established in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti rehion ti Nagorno-Karabakh:** The text doesn't say Armenia *didn't* recognize the region, it says they *didn't officially recognize the new republic* within the region.
*   **B: Ti gubat a maissupiat ti Azeris:** The text mentions the war, but it doesn't say Armenia didn't recognize the war itself.
*   **C: Dagiti diplomatiko nga argumento ti Azerbaijan:** The text doesn't discuss Armenia's stance on Azerbaijan's diplomatic arguments.



"
Ania ti agtul-tuloy a makaapektar kadagiti relasion ti Azerbaijan ken Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Rehion ti Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti diplomatiko a pannakisupiat ti rehion ket agtultuloy a mangdadael ti relasion baet ti Armenia ken Azerbaijan."" This directly links the ongoing diplomatic disputes to the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Dagiti Armenian nga agnanaed iti Azerbaijan:** While Armenian actions in Azerbaijan contribute to the conflict, the passage focuses on the *ongoing dispute* related to Nagorno-Karabakh as the core issue.
* **B: Ti gubat idi 1994:** The 1994 war was the *cause* of the current dispute, but the ongoing issue is the unresolved status of Nagorno-Karabakh stemming from that war.
* **C: Dagiti diplomatiko nga argumento:** Diplomatic arguments are a *result* of the underlying conflict, not the primary ongoing factor. They are a consequence of the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh.



Therefore, the unresolved status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region is the central issue that continues to impact the relationship between Azerbaijan and Armenia.



"
"Bayat ti panag-taxi iti Charlotte, ania ti mabalin a makaiyawat ti kanayonan a masingir?","The correct answer is **C: Panagapan iti Uptown**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Saan kanayon nga agus-usar ti taxi dagiti pamilia idiay Charlotte, nupay kasta ket mabalinda a mausar ti dadduma a kanito. Daytoy ket bayad iti pannagsurok ti 2 a pasahero, isu a daytoy ket mabalin a nanginngina ngem iti kasapulan."" and ""In the past 20 years, the options for raising children in Uptown Charlotte have increased.""

This indicates that taxis are often used *within* Uptown Charlotte. Therefore, the most logical reason for needing a taxi while in Charlotte is to travel to or from Uptown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagnaed iti sabali a lugar** (Traveling to another place): While possible, the text doesn't specifically mention this as a common taxi use.
*   **B: Kaadda ti tallo a pasahero** (Having three passengers): The text only mentions the fare for two passengers.
*   **D: Panagbalin a mannakigayyem iti pamilia** (Being a family caregiver): This is mentioned as a reason people move to Charlotte, but not a reason for needing a taxi *during* a taxi ride.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti maikonsiderar a saan a bentahe ti panagnaed iti Charlotte kadua dagiti ubbing?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti presio ti pabalay (Housing prices)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights the *advantages* of Charlotte for families, such as the high quality of family-friendly options, strong family support from residents, and kid-friendly attractions. It also mentions the availability of taxis.

The question asks about something *not* considered an advantage.  While the passage doesn't explicitly mention housing prices, the implication is that **housing prices are likely a disadvantage** in Charlotte, given that it's a popular place for families and has experienced growth. The passage focuses on the positive aspects, so it *doesn't* state that housing prices are a benefit.  The other options are directly discussed as either advantages (residents moving for family, kid-friendly attractions) or a readily available service (taxis).



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A: Dagiti presio ti pabalay**.



"
"Sakbay a simmangpet dagiti Espaniol, siasino ti akin-kontrol iti amianan a paset ti Chile?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti Mapuche**.

The passage states: ""Sakbay a simmangpet dagiti Español idi maika-16 a siglo, ti makin-amiananan a Chile ket naparmek ti linteg nga Inca bayat a dagiti katutubo nga Araucanian (Mapuche) ket agnanaed iti sentro ken makin-bagatan a Chile."" This directly indicates that the Mapuche controlled the northern part of Chile after the Spanish arrived and the Inca empire was weakened. The term ""Araucanian"" is synonymous with ""Mapuche"" in this context.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a napasamak idi 1810?","The correct answer is **A: Adda kaawan ti gobierno sentral (There was no central government)**.

The text states: ""Uray pay indeklara ti Chile iti panagwaywayasna idi 1810 (bayat iti Napoleonic a gubgubat a nangibati iti Espania nga awan ti agturturay a sentral a gobierno iti mano a tawen)..."" This directly translates to ""Even though Chile declared its independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic Wars which affected Spain with no central government at the time)...""  So, the lack of a central government in Spain during the Napoleonic Wars is the reason why Chile declared independence in 1810.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nangabak ti Chile manipud ti Espaniol (Chile fought against the Spanish):** The text says the fighting didn't happen until 1818.
*   **C: Madama idi dagiti gubat ni Napoleon (Affected by the Napoleonic Wars):** The text explicitly states the Napoleonic Wars *affected* Spain, which indirectly allowed Chile to declare independence, but it doesn't say Chile was *affected* in 1810.
*   **D: Indeklara ti Chile ti kinawayada (Chile declared independence):** The text says Chile declared independence in 1810, which is true, but the question asks what *didn't* happen in 1810."
Kasano a madanon dagiti tattao dagiti adayo a bario iti rehion ti Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Babaen ti tren wenno balangay**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Dagiti dalan, tren ken bangka ti mangikonektar kadagiti barbario..."" which translates to ""Roads, trains, and boats connect the villages...""

Therefore, the options that include train and boat are accurate descriptions of how people travel between the villages.
"
Ania ti kayat a saoen ti Italiano a termino a ‘Cinque Terre’?,"The correct answer is **A: Lima a bario (Five villages)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Cinque Terre, kayatna a sawen Lima a babassit a purok..."". ""Bario"" translates to ""village"" or ""hamlet"" in Italian. Therefore, ""Cinque Terre"" means ""Five Villages"".
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti bota ti maibagay para ti mabalin a nagalis a kondision iti panawen ti niebe?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti botas nga addaan ti studded nga alikamen (Boots with studded soles)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Dagiti sapatos a para iti kalgaw ket gagangay a nakagalgalis no mausar iti yelo ken niebe"" which translates to ""Ice skates are suitable for gripping on ice and snow.""  It also mentions ""masapul a nayanay ti kauneg ti pattern, 5 mm (1/5 pulgada) wenno nasursurok pay, ken nalukneng ti materialesna uray iti nalamiis a temperatura"" which means ""the tread depth must be sufficient, 5 mm (1/5 inch or so), and the material must be resistant to very cold temperatures.""  Studded soles provide the necessary grip on ice and snow, and the text highlights the importance of tread depth and material resistance to cold.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti botas nga addaan ti naakikid a heel (Boots with a wedge heel)**: The text says heels should be low and flat for better grip. Wedge heels would be unsuitable.
*   **C: Dagiti botas a nangato ti heelsna (Boots with high heels)**: High heels are explicitly discouraged because they reduce stability.
*   **D: Dagiti botas nga awanan ti 1/5 nga inch a kaadalem ti patternna (Boots without at least 1/5 inch of tread depth)**: The text clearly states that a tread depth of at least 1/5 inch is necessary for good grip.



"
Ania kadagitoy ti saan a makatulong iti traction kadagiti nagyelo a dalan bayat kadagiti kondision iti panawen ti niebe?,"The correct answer is **D: Danum (Water)**.

Here's why:

* **Asin (Salt), Graba (Gravel), and Darat (Dirt):** These are all commonly used to increase traction on icy and snowy surfaces. Salt lowers the freezing point of water, gravel provides friction, and dirt can offer some grip.
* **Danum (Water):** Water on an icy surface actually *reduces* traction. It creates a slippery layer and makes the situation worse.

Therefore, water is the only option that would *not* help with traction on icy or snowy roads.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a nagpadaan ti Hawaii ken ti Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **C: Agpada ti time zone**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Isu met laeng nga oras ti Hawaii, dagiti isla no maminsan ket mapanunot a “Hawaii down under”."" This directly indicates that the Cook Islands and Hawaii are in the same time zone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agpadada nga addaan ti adu a dadakkel nga hotel:** The passage explicitly states the Cook Islands *lack* large tourist hotels.
* **B: Agpadada nga awan ti estadoda:** Both Hawaii and the Cook Islands are self-governing states (Hawaii is a US state, and the Cook Islands are a self-governing territory in free association with New Zealand). The passage mentions that the Cook Islands are ""awen ti kinaestado.""
* **D: Agpadada nga awan ti aniaman a siudad:** The passage says the Cook Islands *lack* a capital city, but it does have 15 different islands."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga agpaypayso a mangiladawan ti Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa dayta nga arkipelago** (It is an archipelago).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""ti Cook Islands ket maysa nga arkipelago nga addaan iti 15 nga isla..."" (The Cook Islands are an archipelago with 15 islands...).
* Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:
    * **A: Basbassit daytoy ngem Hawaii** (It is smaller than Hawaii): While true, it's a detail, not a defining characteristic.
    * **C: Dagiti kangrunaan a siudadna ket Rarotonga ken Aitutaki** (Its main cities are Rarotonga and Aitutaki): The text mentions these, but it doesn't describe them as *defining* characteristics of the Cook Islands.
    * **D: Ti isla a nasion nga isu met laeng ti orasna iti Hawaii** (It is an island nation that is only one hour from Hawaii):  This is true, but it's more of a geographical fact than a fundamental aspect of *what* the Cook Islands *are*.

Therefore, the most accurate and encompassing answer from the choices provided is that the Cook Islands are an archipelago.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad nga istasion ti ranger ti mangidiaya ti dua a tipo ti pagpilian iti pagturugan?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Sirena**.

The text states: ""Kasapulan nga adda iti permisona agnaedka iti agpatnag idiay Sirena."" (A permit is required to stay at Sirena.) and ""Ti Sirena laeng ti istasion ti tagabantay a mangitukon ti paggianan a dormitorio ken napudot a makan kanayonan ti panagkampo."" (Sirena is the only ranger station that manages the communal dormitory and basic camp food.)

The other options are mentioned as only managing campgrounds *without* food services.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ka a makareserba ti pammalubos iti pagparadaan no kayatmo a mangusar ti kuarta imbes a kredito?","The correct answer is **C: Ti CafeNet El Sol**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Mabalin a makaala kadagiti permiso a direkta manipud iti Ranger Station iti Puerto Jimenez, ngem saanda nga agawat iti credit card."" This eliminates option B.
* The text also says: ""Ti Sirena laeng ti istasion ti tagabantay a mangitukon ti paggianan a dormitorio ken napudot a makan kanayonan ti panagkampo."" This implies you don't need to reserve *camping* through Sirena, just access to the facilities.
* While the text mentions the Ranger Station in Puerto Jiménez, it explicitly states they don't accept credit cards.
* The CafeNet El Sol is mentioned as providing reservation services for a fee *and* accepts credit cards (""Agur-uray a serbisio para iti gatad a US$30, wenno $10 para iti maysa-aldaw a pammalubos"").

Therefore, CafeNet El Sol is the only option that allows payment with credit cards for reservation services.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti skiing ti maar-aramid iti narangkis a daga?","The correct answer is **B: Backcountry skiing**.

The text explicitly states: ""...ti naudi ket maubra iti narangkis a daga ken kasapula ti natangtangken a ski ken bota."" This refers to backcountry skiing.  ""Backcountry skiing"" is a common term for skiing in ungroomed, off-piste terrain.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ski hiking:** The text distinguishes ski hiking as *not* involving groomed slopes and needing specialized equipment. It's a type of backcountry skiing, but not the primary term for skiing on ungroomed terrain.
* **C: Alpine nga istilo:** The text contrasts alpine skiing with backcountry skiing. Alpine skiing requires groomed slopes and specific equipment.
* **D: Backpacking babaen ti ski:** This is a general description of the activity, not a specific *type* of skiing.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a makatulong kadagiti agis-iski iti aw-away a mangayat ti makadanon iti nangatngato a kapaspas?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti nasayaat a kondision (Good conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""no magmagnaka - ngem manmano laeng a madanunmo iti kapaspas ti panag-iski nga awan ti nadagsen a bitbitem kadagiti naiplastar a pag-iskian."" This translates to: ""if it gets bad - but only if you can manage the speed skiing without a smooth surface on groomed ski slopes.""  This implies that *good conditions* are essential to maintain speed when skiing in backcountry conditions (ski touring or ski hiking) where the terrain isn't perfectly prepared.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Natangtangken a bota (Boots):** The passage mentions ""natangtangken a ski"" (skis) and ""bota"" (boots) as equipment for alpine skiing, but not specifically for backcountry skiing.
* **B: Dagiti nadagsen a backpack (Smooth backpacks):** This is irrelevant to skiing speed or backcountry conditions.
* **D: Dagiti naiplastar a pag-iskian (Groomed ski slopes):**  The passage specifically says backcountry skiing *doesn't* involve groomed slopes. It mentions the lack of them as a factor in maintaining speed.



"
Dagiti agbi-biahe a makapadpadas ti re-entry shock ket marigrigatan a mangaramid ti?,"The correct answer is **D: Panangibagay manen iti kulturada iti pagtaenganda (Re-acclimating to their own culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that re-entry shock happens because travelers adapt to a new culture and then struggle to readjust to their original one. Option D directly addresses this need to re-adjust to their own culture after experiencing a different one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pannakibagay iti kultura ti baro a lugar (Adapting to the new culture):** This is what *causes* re-entry shock, not how to overcome it.
*   **B: Panagbalin a naanus ken mannakaawat (Becoming judgmental and condescending):** This is a negative consequence of *not* adapting well to a new culture, and it's not a solution to re-entry shock.
*   **C: Pangbiahe iti abroad (Traveling abroad):** While travel is the context of the passage, simply traveling more won't solve re-entry shock.

Therefore, the passage indicates that the key to mitigating re-entry shock is to readjust to one's own cultural norms after returning from abroad.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti re-entry shock ket naisingsingayan a narigat para ti ania a tipo ti agbi-biahe?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti agbi-biahe a nakapadas ti partikular a madi a culture shock (Those who experience a particular severe culture shock).**

The passage states that re-entry shock is difficult for those who experience culture shock that is ""nababbaba ngem iti panawen ti honeymoon"" (not mild but during the honeymoon period) and ""mabalin a nakarkaro pay"" (can even be severe).  This implies a significant culture shock. Options B, C, and D don't accurately reflect the passage's emphasis on the *severity* of the culture shock.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti rumbeng a liklikan dagiti tattao nga aramiden kadagiti moose?,"The correct answer is **D: Panagobserbar manipud ti adayo (Observing from a distance)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that moose are not inherently aggressive but will defend themselves if threatened. 
* It also suggests that moose may not be perceived as a threat if people don't approach them closely.
* Therefore, observing them from a distance minimizes the chance of startling or threatening the moose, and thus reduces the risk of a defensive reaction.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Di ikankano ti kaadda dagitoy (Don't make noise):** While being quiet is helpful, it's not the primary way to avoid aggression. It's more about not startling them.
* **B: Panagasideg a naannad (Approach cautiously):**  ""Cautiously"" is better than aggressively, but it still involves getting closer, which could be perceived as threatening.
* **C: Panagkissay ti lebel ti mabalin a peggadda (Mimic their level of alertness):** This is too complex and not a practical or reliable way to interact with wild animals.


"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a sasao maipapan kadagiti moose ti saan a pudno?","The correct answer is **A: Dagitoy ket natural nga agresibo nga animal**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ti moose (maawagan met nga elk) ket saan met a talaga a naranggas, ngem depensaranda ti bagida no makasagrapda ti pakadangran."" This translates to: ""Moose (also called elk) are not actually aggressive, but they will defend themselves if they feel threatened.""

Option A directly contradicts this by calling them ""naturally aggressive."" The other options are either true statements from the text (B & D) or not directly mentioned (C).
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan unay a delikado para ti agbi-biahe iti disierto?","The correct answer is **B: Ti panagkita ti mirage a mangiyaw-awat ti ilusion ti danum.**

Here's why:

The passage states that mirages can lead travelers astray and cause them to waste precious water, making conditions even more dangerous. While all the options relate to dangers in the desert, option B is presented as a phenomenon that *can* happen (encountering a mirage). The other options (A, C, and D) describe consequences of the dangers already mentioned in the passage.  

Therefore, encountering a mirage itself is the initial danger highlighted.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga kas mabalin a peggad para kadagiti agbi-biahe iti disierto?,"The correct answer is **D: Sunburn**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the dangers of dehydration, mirages, and hypothermia in the desert.** 
* **Sunburn is a common danger in the desert due to intense sunlight, but it's not explicitly mentioned as a potential issue in the text.**  The passage doesn't discuss sun protection as a specific problem.

Therefore, sunburn is the most accurate answer as something *not* mentioned as a risk in the provided text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a populasion ti grupo ti talaga a naapektaran kalpasan ti panagsangpet dagiti abenturero?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti Taínos**.

The text states: ""permi a naipabassit dagiti manangraut nga Español ti populasion idiay Tainos"" which translates to ""the ruthless Spanish reduced the population of the Tainos."" It also mentions that 100,000 Taino people were killed.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a legguahe ti sasaoen dagiti Caribes?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""Dagiti Caribes ti tattao nga agsasao ti Arawakan..."" which translates to ""The Caribs are people who speak Arawakan...""
"
Siasino ti nagpabalin a nalatak iti skiing kas maysa nga aktibidad a mangliwliwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti Norwegian**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Idi 1861 Iinuktan dagiti Norweigan idiay Australia ti umuna a klab ti paglinglingayan nga iski"" (In 1861, the Norwegians established the first ski club in Australia). This directly indicates that Norwegians were instrumental in formalizing skiing as a sport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti ski bum:** ""Ski bums"" are a type of skier, not the ones who made skiing a sport.
* **C: Dagiti agtataeng iti kueba:** People who drew cave paintings skied long ago, but they didn't establish skiing as a sport in the 17th or 18th centuries.
* **D: Dagiti Australian:** Australians were involved in the establishment of a ski club, but the Norwegians initiated the sport itself.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a panawen a damo a nabigbig ti skiing kas maysa nga isport?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 BC**.

The text states: ""Idi kapanunotan ti panag-ski ket daan unayen - dagiti ladawan ti kueba nga ipakpakitana dagiti manag-ski ket naaramid iti kas kaadayo ti 5000 BC!"" (Skiing dates back - cave paintings depicting skiers were made as far back as 5000 BC!)
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kadawyan a mainaig iti kadakkelan nga isla ti tan-aw ti daya a paset ti Africa?,"The correct answer is **A: Impluwensia ati Europe**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Nangrugi dagiti impluensia ken kolonialismo a Europeo idi maika-15 a siglo..."" (European influences and colonialism began in the 15th century...). This directly connects European influence to the islands.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Islamiko a relihion:** While Islam *was* introduced and spread, the passage highlights the later arrival of European influences as a significant development.
* **C: Naatap nga animal:** The passage mentions the islands are known for their beaches, not specifically for rare animals.
* **D: Dagiti nangina a resort:**  While the passage notes attractive beaches, it doesn't focus on the islands being specifically known for resorts.



"
Ania ti saan a langa dagiti babassit nga isla iti East Africa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ti reputasion para kadagiti naatap nga animal (The reputation for amazing animals)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that many of the smaller islands are **uninhabited** or **belong to nations associated with France**, and are **known for their stunning beaches**. 
* It doesn't mention anything about them having a reputation for amazing animals. The passage focuses on their lack of inhabitants, connection to France, and beaches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti koneksion iti France (Connection to France):** The passage explicitly states this is true.
* **B: Adu a nangina a resort (Many luxurious resorts):** The passage mentions that the islands are ""nalatak para kadagiti nangingina a pagayuyangan nga aplaya"" (renowned for their pristine beaches), implying resorts exist.
* **D: Kinawaya manipud kadagiti sabali pay a nasion (Dominance from other nations):** The passage mentions nations associated with France and the influence of Arab and European colonialism, indicating some level of dominance/influence from other nations.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano a maiselebrar ti Easter iti sumagmamano a naisingingayan a tradisional a simbaan?","The correct answer is **B: Panag-host ti vigil iti Sabado ti rabii**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ad-adu pay a tradisional a simbaan ti mangiyusuat ti Panagkararag ti Semana iti rabii ti Sabado kabayatan ti Semana santa, nga adda dagiti kongregasion nga agselebrar iti tengnga rabii ti panagungar ni Kristo."" This directly translates to ""Many traditional churches still hold a vigil on Saturday night during Holy Week, with some congregations celebrating in the middle of Christ's resurrection.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagangay ti ritual ti fertilidad:** While some traditions *may* have roots in fertility rituals, the text doesn't mention this. It focuses on the Christian context.
* **C: Kaaddaan ti spring party para ti kagimongan:** This is not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Panagbuya ti panagungar ti init:** The text mentions the tradition of lighting bonfires to celebrate the return of the sun, but it doesn't say this is how Easter is celebrated in traditional churches. It's presented as a possible earlier tradition.



"
"Tapno maliklikan dagiti paritkular a kasapulan no sumsumrek iti Ecuador, ti maysa nga umili Cuba ket masapul nga addaan umuna ti ania?","The correct answer is **B: Ti napagbalin a legal a surat ti imbitasion**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Daytoy a surat ket masapul nga iligalisa ti Ministro ti Foreign Affairs iti Ecuador...Dagitoy a kasapulan ket inaramid tapno mangited ti na-organisa nga urnos ti panagakar iti baet ti agpada a pagilian.""  This means a legalized invitation letter is a fundamental requirement.

While the other options are important, they are secondary to the initial invitation.  You need the invitation *first* to even begin the process of securing a passport, tickets, etc.

* **A: Ti passport a mabalin agingga ti 6 a bulan a labes dagiti petsa ti panagbiahe** is necessary, but not the *first* requirement.
* **C: Ti tiket a mapan ken agpasubli tapno mapaneknekan ti kaatiddog ti panagtalinaed** is also important, but again, requires the invitation to be secured.
* **D: Ti green a kard iti US** is required only for Cuban citizens *with* a green card and is a specific condition mentioned, not a general requirement for all travelers.



"
Ania ti saan a nakaidisenioan dagiti kasapulan ti panagbiahe iti Ecuador?,"The correct answer is **A: Panagtalinaed iti kababaan a bilang dagiti agbi-biahe (Maintaining a low number of travelers)**.

Here's why:

The passage clearly states the requirements are to ensure organized entry for citizens of Cuba into Ecuador. This relates to:

* **B: Panangmentenar ti naurnos nga ayus ti migrasion (Maintaining orderly migration):**  The entire passage is about organized entry and legal requirements.
* **C: Panangkumpirma ti kaatiddog ti panagtalinaed ti agbi-biahe (Confirming the validity of travel documents):**  Requirements for passports and travel tickets are mentioned.
* **D: Panagsigurado kadagiti kinabalin dagiti passport (Ensuring passport validity):**  The passage states passports need to be valid for at least 6 months beyond the return date.

However, the passage *doesn't* say the requirements are to keep the number of travelers *low*.  The focus is on legal and organizational procedures, not on limiting the number of people entering the country.



"
Ania ti sumaganad ti nangin-ngina iti sabali a pagilian ngem iti pagtataengan?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti nangina a frame (Old frames)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti agkakangina a frame nga adda ti kastoy a lugar ket mabalin nga addaan iti dua a problema; mabalin a dagiti dadduma ket peke, dagiti agpayso nga imported ket mabalin a nanginngina ngem iti adda diay balay.""  This translates to: ""Old frames in such a place may have two problems; they may be fake, and the expensive imported ones may be old but are kept at home.""

The question asks what has been old in another country but not in the place of residence. The passage directly addresses old frames being kept at home. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"
Ania ti mabalin a peggad kadagiti panaggatang ti nangina a frame iti sabali a pagilian?,"The best answer is **C: Mabalin a peke dagitoy**.

Here's why:

* **The original text states:** ""dagiti agkakangina a frame nga adda ti kastoy a lugar ket mabalin nga addaan iti dua a problema; mabalin a dagiti dadduma ket peke..."" (Frames sold in such places may have two problems; some may be fake...)

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ti kanayonan nga eksamen ti mata ket mabalin a maikasapulan:** While an eye exam might be needed, the text doesn't directly say this is a *problem* with the frames themselves. It focuses on the authenticity of the frames.
* **B: Ti reseta ket mabalin a saanen a mabalin para kadagiti partikular a frame:**  The text mentions bringing the prescription to be used elsewhere. It doesn't imply the prescription is incompatible with the frames, but rather the frames themselves might be fake.
* **D: Mabalin a saan a saklawen ti seguro ti gastos:**  The text doesn't address insurance coverage.

Therefore, **C: Mabalin a peke dagitoy** is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the provided text.



"
"Maipapan ti panagusar ti currency iti Falkland, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Malaksid ti pound ti Falkland, ti pound ti Britanio ket kadawyan a maakseptar a currency.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Dagiti pound ti Britania ket mabalin a maakseptar sadinoman diay isla ken iti uneg ti Stanley..."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti kard ti kredito ken pound ti Britanio laeng ti maawat kadagiti karruba nga isla** - The text says British pounds are widely accepted *within* the islands, not just in the rural areas. Credit cards from remote islands are unreliable.
* **B: Ti Stanley laeng ti lugar a mangakseptar ti dolyar iti Estados Unidos** - The text says US dollars are *often* accepted in Stanley, but not *only* in Stanley.
* **C: Ti pound ti Falkland ket masapul a maisukat kalpasan a pumanaw iti isla** - The text states it's impossible to exchange currency outside the islands, but it doesn't say it's *required* to exchange it upon leaving.  It just advises doing so *before* leaving.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, no agbi-biahe iti Falklands manipud ti Estados Unidos, sadinno a mabalin a mausar ti sabali pay a pamay-an ti panagbayad malaksid ti credit cards ti talaga a makatulong?","The correct answer is **A: Iti paggatangan ti FIC West**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mabalin a maisukat ti kuarta iti maymaysa a banko kadagiti isla a masarakan iti Stanley iti ballasiw ti paggatangan ti FIC West.""  This directly indicates that the FIC West bank is a place where you can exchange currency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kabayatan ti amin nga isla:** The text says you can't exchange currency outside the islands, so this is incorrect.
* **C: Kadagiti adayo nga isla:**  The text explicitly states that credit cards from remote islands are not always accepted.
* **D: Kabayatan iti Stanley:** While you *can* use British pounds and US dollars in Stanley, the text points to the FIC West bank as the *specific* place for currency exchange.



"
Ania a pasamak ti saan a nainaig kadagiti selebrasion dagiti fiesta ti templo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti pannakaiyanak ti elepante**.

Here's why:

The passage states that temple festivals often celebrate the anniversary of the temple, the birth of a god, or other significant events related to the temple. While elephants are part of the celebrations (parades), the *birth of an elephant* is not mentioned as a reason for a temple festival. The other options (B, C, and D) are all explicitly mentioned as reasons for these celebrations.
"
Sadinno a lugar a makita dagiti naarkosan nga elepante?,"The correct answer is **C: Kadagiti parada dagiti piesta ti templo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kaaduan a piesta iti templo ket maselselebraran a kas paset ti anibersario ti templo wenno ti panagkasangay ti dios wenno aniaman a kangrunaan a pasamak nga adda pakainaiganna iti templo. Nakaay-ayat a makita dagiti piesta ti templo ni Kerala, adda ti regular a parada dagiti naarkosan nga elepante...""
* This directly connects the elephants to the temple festivals and their parades.

The other options are less accurate:

* **A: Sadinno man mangrugi iti agtapos ti Nobiembre agingga iti katengngaan ti Mayo:** This is the timeframe for the festivals, not where the elephants are seen.
* **B: Kadagiti templo:** While elephants *might* be present at temples, the passage specifically mentions them in parades *during* the festivals.
* **D: Kadagiti dalan ti Kerala:**  This is too general. While parades happen on Kerala's roads, the passage ties the elephants directly to the temple festivals.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti posible unay a wagas tapno makatipid ti kuarta iti business wenno first class a pamasahe iti eroplano?","The correct answer is **C: Panag-book ti saan a tarus a first class a flight.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ammo dagiti airline nga adda maysa a partikular a grupo dagiti managbiahe iti eroplano a sisasagana nga agbayad iti uray mano a doliar tapno laeng al-alisto ken mas komportableda a makadanon iti sadinoman a papananda, isu a singirenda ida iti maitutop."" This implies airlines offer tiered services and pricing, with options *below* first class that still provide added comfort and benefits. This suggests that booking a flight in a category *below* first class might be a more economical way to enjoy a better travel experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pabayadan daytoy iti kompaniam:** The text argues that even if the company covers the cost, it might not be worth it because the price is still high.
* **B: Panag-book ti first class imbes a business:** This is the opposite of what the text suggests. The text says business class is *already* expensive.
* **D: Panagbirok ti diskuento:** The text states that discounts are rare for direct flights.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti sayang laeng iti oras a biruken no ag-book kadagiti partikular a klase ti pamasahe?","The correct answer is **D: First class**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ammo dagiti airline nga adda maysa a partikular a grupo dagiti managbiahe iti eroplano a sisasagana nga agbayad iti uray mano a doliar tapno laeng al-alisto ken mas komportableda a makadanon iti sadinoman a papananda, isu a singirenda ida iti maitutop."" This directly refers to **First Class** as the most expensive and luxurious option, indicating that the high price is for the privilege of comfort and exclusivity. The passage implies that it's a waste of money for those who aren't willing to pay the premium.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti tarus a flight** - This is too general. The passage isn't just talking about expensive flights in general.
*   **B: Business class** - While Business Class is expensive, the passage emphasizes First Class's extreme price point and the idea that it's a waste of money if not truly desired.
*   **C: Dagiti diskuento** - The passage says that discounts for business or first class are rare on direct routes.

Therefore, the passage highlights First Class as the class where the high price is most likely a waste of money for most travelers.



"
Ania ti saan a kasapulan a mainayon bayat ti pannakaiyasping ti dagup a quote ti pamasahe paapan ti Africa iti round-the-world a pamasahe?,"The correct answer is **C: Gasto para ti African a visa**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what is *not* needed when comparing the cost of a round-the-world ticket to a trip to Africa.**
* The passage explicitly states that ""mainayon bayat ti pannakaiyasping ti dagup a quote ti pamasahe paapan ti Africa iti round-the-world a pamasahe"" refers to additional costs *outside* of the flights themselves.
* The passage lists several additional costs: visas for countries *outside* of Africa, departure taxes, transportation, and other expenses for destinations *outside* of Africa.
* **The key is that the comparison is between a trip *to* Africa and a round-the-world trip.**  Therefore, visa costs *for Africa itself* are not relevant to this comparison. The passage mentions needing visas for countries *outside* of Africa, which *are* relevant.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gasto para kadagiti kanayonan a visa kadagiti lugar iti ruar ti Africa:** This is an additional cost that would be factored into the overall cost of a trip to Africa (and a round-the-world trip).
* **B: Gasto para ti buis ti panagpanaw iti Africa:** This is an additional cost that would be factored into the overall cost of a trip to Africa (and a round-the-world trip).
* **D: Gasto ti transportasion iti daga para kadagiti lugar iti ruar ti Africa:** This is an additional cost that would be factored into the overall cost of a trip to Africa (and a round-the-world trip).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti irugrugi nga idiaya dagiti supermarket iti ad-adu a pagpilian?","The correct answer is **A: Nakasaganan a makan (Convenience foods)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dagiti supermarket ket agbalbalin nga umadu ti agduduma a seksion iti naisaganan a makan."" (Supermarkets are becoming increasingly divided into different sections of convenience foods.)

While the other options are mentioned, they are not the *primary* focus of the supermarket's expansion in terms of offering more choices. The increase in convenience foods is the core point.
"
Ania nga amenity ti ipaay ti sumagmamano a supermarket a mabalin a kayat ti kostumer a gumat-gatang ti nakasaganan a makan?,"The correct answer is **D: Maysa a microwave oven**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Adda pay ti mangted ti microwave oven wenno sabali pay a wagas a pagpapudot ti makan."" (There is also the option of using a microwave oven or other ways to heat food.)  This directly links microwave ovens to the convenience of eating prepared food purchased at the supermarket.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti panganan iti site (Food on site):** While some supermarkets *might* have food counters, the passage emphasizes the *lack* of opportunities to cook and the reliance on pre-prepared foods.  This isn't the *amenity* the passage highlights.
* **B: Basbassit a pagpilian (Limited selection):** The passage indicates that the selection is *limited* *because* people can't cook, implying the opposite of a broad selection.
* **C: Naata a makan (Nutritious food):** The passage doesn't focus on the nutritional value of the food, but rather on the convenience of eating it without cooking.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maawatan dagiti agsasao ti French a Belgian ken Swiss?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti naisingsingayan a sao iti French (Nuances of French)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Nangnangruna, ti sistema ti panagbilang ti agsasao ti French idiay Belgium ken Switzerland ket adda ti sumagmamano a pagsasabalianna iti French a pagsasao iti France, ken ti panangbalikas iti dadduma a sao ket sabali bassit."" (Primarily, the number system in French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland has several differences from French spoken in France, and pronunciation of certain words is slightly different.)
* **The text also states:** ""Ngem, amin a Belgian ken Swiss nga agsasao ti Pranses ket naadalda ti pagalagadan a Pranses idiay eskuelaan, isu a mabalinda a matarusan uray pay no usarem ti pagalagadan a sistema ti numero a Pranses."" (However, all Belgians and Swiss who speak French were taught standard French in school, so they can understand even if standard French number systems are used.)

This implies they *can* understand standard French, but they might not grasp subtle *nuances* or idiomatic expressions that are common in France but less so in Belgium and Switzerland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti pagalagadan a sistema ti numero a Pranses (The standard French number system):** The text explicitly says they *can* understand this.
* **C: Dagiti partikular a panangbalikas kadagiti sao iti French (Specific pronunciations of words):** The text states pronunciations are *slightly* different, but they understand standard French.
* **D: Kaaduan a pagsasao a French idiay France (Most French words used in France):** The text says the number system and pronunciation are different, but they understand standard French.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga agpada iti France kas iti Belgium wenno Switzerland?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti sistema ti panagbilang (The numbering system)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nangnangruna, ti sistema ti panagbilang ti agsasao ti French idiay Belgium ken Switzerland ket adda ti sumagmamano a pagsasabalianna iti French a pagsasao iti France...""  This directly indicates that the numbering system is different.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti panagebkas kadagiti amin a sarita (The way words are pronounced):** The passage mentions differences in pronunciation, but it also says that Belgian and Swiss French speakers are taught standard French in school and can understand standard French.
* **C: Ti kadawyan a French a maisursuro kadagiti eskuwelaan (The standard French taught in schools):**  The passage states that speakers in Belgium and Switzerland are taught *standard* French.  This is intended to bridge the gap between their local dialects and the French spoken in France.
* **D: Ti ispeling ti sumagmamano a sarita iti French (The spelling of some words):** The passage mentions differences in vocabulary and pronunciation, but *not* spelling.



Therefore, the numbering system is the only element specifically identified as differing from France in the passage.
"
Iti ania a kasasaad a saan ka a maidiayaan ti bereavement a pamasahe?,"The correct answer is **A: No agbibiahe ka iti WestJet**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that bereavement fares are offered by airlines like Air Canada, Delta, and Lufthansa. While it doesn't explicitly say *which* airline *doesn't* offer them, option A is the only one listed as an airline where bereavement fares are *not* implied to be available. The other options all list airlines known to generally offer bereavement fares (or at least, the text doesn't preclude them).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: No paadasem a mangi-book a tarus iti airline imbes a ti maikatlo a partido a serbisio:** This is not mentioned in the text. The text only states that booking must be done directly with the airline.
*   **C: No agbibiahe ka ti Lufthansa manipud ti Paris paapan ti Estados Unidos:** The text lists Lufthansa as an airline that offers bereavement fares. The location of the flight doesn't seem to be a factor mentioned in the text regarding bereavement fares.
*   **D: No agbibiahe ka ti Delta:** The text lists Delta as an airline that offers bereavement fares.

Therefore, the only answer that aligns with the provided information is A."
Ania ti agpaypayso maipapan kadagiti bereavement a pamasahe?,"The provided text discusses last-minute flight deals and doesn't mention anything about bereavement fares. Therefore, none of the options (A, B, C, or D) can be definitively answered based on the text. 

**However, the text states that reservations for the mentioned deals must be made directly with the airline by phone.** This implies that bereavement fares, if they exist, would likely also need to be booked directly with the airline.

Therefore, the *most likely* answer, based on the information provided *and general knowledge about bereavement fares*, is **D: Kasapulanda nga i-book a tarus iti airline babaen ti telepono.**

**Important Note:**  Without more information, this is an educated guess. The text doesn't actually address bereavement fares."
Kaano a nanamnam-ay ti panagusar ti standalone a GPS device ngem ti navigation app a GPS?,"The best answer is **A: No padpadasem ti agtipid iti kuarta**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph contrasts the costs of using GPS apps versus standalone devices.** The paragraph explicitly mentions that GPS apps can cost money for map updates, specialized features, or different providers.  Standalone GPS devices, on the other hand, are often a one-time purchase.
* **The other options are less directly supported by the text:**
    * **B: No sigurado ka nga addan ti koneksyonmo iti data:** The paragraph highlights that lack of data connection limits the effectiveness of GPS apps.
    * **C: No mapan iti ruar ti sakup a lugar:** While a standalone device *might* be better for off-grid use, the paragraph doesn't specifically say that GPS apps *can't* be used in remote areas. It just says performance is limited.
    * **D: No saanmo a kayat a mangabang ti device:** The paragraph doesn't explicitly mention the preference to avoid purchasing a device. It focuses more on the cost aspects.

Therefore, the most directly supported reason for choosing a GPS app over a standalone device, based on the provided text, is to **save money.**



"
Ania ti saan a nasayaat a rason nga usaren ti navigation app a GPS kas maiyasping iti standalone a device?,"The correct answer is **A: Saanen a kasapulan nga agdanag maipapan ti koneksion iti data.**

Here's why:

The original text states that a major drawback of using smartphone GPS navigation is the need for data connection. A standalone GPS device doesn't require data to function. The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Panagtipid ti kuarta:** GPS apps can cost money (for map updates or premium features).
* **C: Panangliklik kadagiti panagabang:**  While apps can be distracting, this isn't a *reason* to avoid using a standalone device entirely.
* **D: Saanen a kasapulan a gumatang kadagiti baro a mapa:** GPS apps *do* require map updates to stay current.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasanom a masigurado a naipada ka ti maibagay a barko?","The correct answer is **C: Panag-book iti ahente a nalaing iti panagbiahe ti Galapagos**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Siguraduem a ti ahente a nagpapareserbaam ket maysa nga espesialista iti Galapagos nga addaan umiso a pannakaammo iti adu a klase ti barbarko."" (Be sure that the agent who makes your reservations is a Galapagos specialist with a deep knowledge of various types of boats.) This directly addresses how to ensure you get a suitable boat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panag-book iti grupo ti 8+ a pasahero nga agpapada iti interes:** While a larger group *might* offer more options, the text doesn't say this is the *primary* way to guarantee a suitable boat. It's more about the agent's expertise.
* **B: Panag-book bayat ti low season:** Booking during low season addresses the issue of boat availability due to weather, but it doesn't guarantee you'll get a boat that aligns with your interests.
* **D: Panag-book ti adayo a nasaksakbay:** Booking far in advance *might* help, but the text again emphasizes the importance of an experienced agent.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nausar kas taktika tapno mapagtalinaed nga agsug-sugal dagiti bisita?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti insentibo kas kadagiti libre a tiket iti konsierto**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions that casinos use incentives like special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep visitors gambling and prevent them from leaving. Offering free tickets to a concert falls under this category of incentives.

The passage also mentions free drinks as a tactic, but it doesn't mention natural lighting or lack of clocks as strategies. Therefore, options A and D are incorrect.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan a liklikan ti nalaing a sugalero?","The correct answer is **A: Panaginum ti adu nga arak**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sumagmamano a lugar ket mangmangted ti libre nga arak. Uray pay no kasta, ti kinabartek ket mangikkat iti limpio, ken amin a nalaing a mannugal ket ammona iti importansia ti kinausaw."" This means that even with free alcohol, responsible gamblers should avoid excessive drinking. The text highlights the importance of moderation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panangawat kadagiti aniaman nga insentibo:** The text doesn't mention any specific warnings about incentives.
* **C: Panagkita kadagiti relo wenno orasan:** There's no mention of clocks being a problem.
* **D: Panagdamag iti kaasitgan a pagruaran:** While overeating might be a concern, the text focuses on alcohol as a more direct risk to responsible gambling.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a paset ti pagsasao ti ma-capitalize iti tengnga ti keddeng?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti noun**.

The passage states: ""Amin a nombre, kadua dagita sao ni Sie para kenka, ket kanayon nga umuna ti dakkel a letra, uray no adda sadiay tengngana ti keddeng."" This translates to: ""All names, both your and Sie's, are always capitalized, even if they are in the middle of a sentence."" Names are nouns.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a mangparigat iti kapitalisasion dagiti noun?","The correct answer is **C: Panagsurat**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while reading might be easy, writing is more complex because you need to know when to use verbs/adjectives in a substantivized form (acting like a noun). This is a key challenge in proper capitalization of nouns in writing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagbasa (Reading):**  The passage says reading is *easy*.
* **B: Panagbigbig kadagiti aksion (Giving verbs):** While verbs are part of language, the passage focuses on the more nuanced issue of *how* verbs and adjectives function in writing, not just their existence.
* **D: Panagbigbig kadagiti banbanag (Giving adjectives):** Similar to verbs, adjectives are relevant, but the passage's core point is about the specific complexities of using them (and verbs) as nouns in writing.



"
"Kadagiti rural a paset ti Malaysia, ania a gesture ti kayatna a saoen ket “umay ka ditoy”?","The correct answer is **A: Panagkillu ti tammudo (Waving)**.

The text explicitly states: ""kadagiti Malay iti sulsulimek, kayatna sawen ket “umay ka,” kasla ti tammudo a kulpiem..."" This translates to ""...in rural Malaysia, they want to say ""come here,"" like a friendly wave..."" 

Therefore, the gesture they use is a friendly wave.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a gesture ti mabalin a kayatna a saoen ket “agsubli ka”?","The correct answer is **A: Panagpayapay ti ima nakasango ti dakulap (Waving at a cloud that looks like a person)**.

The passage states: ""maysa a biahero a Briton iti Espania ket mabalin nga agkamali a ti panagkaway nga agpakada pakairamanan ti dakulap a sumango iti agpakpakada (saan nga iti tao a pagpakpakadaan) ket mangibaga nga agsublika."" This translates to: ""a British traveler in Spain might mistakenly think that waving at a cloud that looks like a person (not a person-shaped cloud) means ""go away"".""

Therefore, the gesture that *could* be mistaken for meaning ""go away"" is waving at a cloud that resembles a person.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti gapu dagiti yuyeng?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti rangtay a niebe (Snowdrifts)**.

The text states: ""Paggapuan daytoy iti birri, yuyeng, a mabalin mailemmeng dagiti rangtay a niebe."" This translates to: ""It's filled with snowdrifts, which can cover the snow peaks."" 

Therefore, the snowdrifts are what the glacier is filling with.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti maidulin ti rangtay ti niebe?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti dadakkel a bloke**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Idiay igid iti dadakkel a tippang ti yelo ket narba ti dadakkel a bloke, natnag ken mabalin a timpuak wenno nagtulid nga immadayo aggapu iti igid."" 

This translates to: ""At the edge of a large ice sheet, large blocks are calved, broken, and can either float away or move away from the edge."" 

Therefore, the passage directly mentions ""dagiti dadakkel a bloke"" (large blocks) as something that happens at the edge of the glacier. The other options are mentioned as parts affected by the melting/movement, but not directly as the *result* of the ice calving.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, dagiti agbi-biahe ket masapul a mangaramid kadagiti kanayonan a panagannad sakbay ti panagbisita ti ania a lugar?","The correct answer is **A: Ti bulkan ti Nyiragongo**.

The text states: ""masapul nga ammuen nga umuna ti situasion ti agdama a panaglalaban iti probinsia ti Amianan a Kivu sakbay ti aniaman a panagpasiar iti ruar ti Goma. **Ti siudad met ti pagrugianan ti panagkalay-at iti bulkan a Nyiragongo** ken iti dadduma a nalalaka a panagsapul iti Gorilla ti Bantay idiay Africa.""

This indicates that the Nyiragongo volcano is a significant area to be aware of and potentially avoid due to the ongoing conflict and volcanic activity. While the other options are mentioned in the text, the volcano is specifically highlighted as requiring awareness and caution.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nasayaat a singasing para ti turista iti Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti laban iti North Kivu ket makaliwliwa (The conflict in North Kivu is dangerous)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Masapul nga ammuen nga umuna ti situasion ti agdama a panaglalaban iti probinsia ti Amianan a Kivu sakbay ti aniaman a panagpasiar iti ruar ti Goma"" (It is important to note the current conflict situation in the North Kivu province before any excursion outside of Goma).  This highlights the danger of the conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mayat a lugar daytoy para ti nalaka a Mountain Gorilla Tracking (It's a good place for high-altitude Mountain Gorilla Tracking):** The passage states Goma is the starting point for Gorilla Tracking in Africa. So this is accurate.
* **C: Dagiti motorcycle a taxi ket mayat a wagas tapno makita ti lawlaw (Motorcycle taxis are a good way to see the lawlaw):** The passage mentions motorcycle taxis are a good way to get around Goma. The term ""lawlaw"" is unclear and not supported by the passage.
* **D: Ti base ti bulkan a Nyiragongo ket adda iti siudad (The base of Mount Nyiragongo is in the city):** The passage states Goma is the starting point for Gorilla Tracking and Mount Nyiragongo is located near Goma. So this is accurate.



"
Kaano nga agbalin a sidadaan ti backcountry a pammalubos para ti rugi nga aldaw ti Agosto?,"The correct answer is **A: Maika-1 ti Enero**.

The text states: ""Isu a ti permiso a backcountry para iti aniaman a rugi nga aldaw ti Mayo ket mabalin a maala iti 1 ti Enero."" This implies that the timeframe for applying for backcountry permits, including August, begins on January 1st.
"
Ania a polisiya ti adda tapno masalakniban ti canyon?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti umuna a mapan, umuna a maserbian a sistema ti pammalubos**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Adda ti manmano a numero ti permiso para kadagiti walk-in a kiddaw a magun-odan ti basar a no sino ti umuna a sumangpet, isu met ti umuna a maikkan."" This directly describes a ""first come, first served"" system for walk-up permits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti pammalubos ket sidadaan laeng iti maika-1 ti Enero:** While the first day of January is important for booking May permits, it's not the only time permits are available.
* **C: Dagiti pammalubos ket magun-od laeng babaen kadagiti walk-in a kiddaw:** The passage mentions both reservation permits and walk-up permits.
* **D: Ti limitado a bilang dagiti pammalubos:** While permits are limited, the passage describes the *system* for obtaining them, not just the fact that they are limited.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan unay a kadawyan a mabirukan iti tipo dagiti hotel a nailadawan iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **A: Maysa a cocktail bar**.

Here's why:

The passage describes hotels from a time when travel was more challenging, often relying on trains and ships. These hotels were luxurious for their time but lacked the modern amenities we expect today.  

* **Cocktail bars** were not as common or expected in these older hotels. The focus was more on basic comforts and perhaps a lounge area, but not necessarily a dedicated cocktail bar with a wide selection.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Maysa nga onsite gourmet a restoran:** While the passage mentions ""naiimas a makan,"" ""gourmet"" is a more modern term.  Luxury hotels of the era would have had excellent dining, but not necessarily a ""gourmet"" restaurant.
* **C: Dagiti kadua a bisita a popular wenno mabigbig:** The passage states these hotels hosted dignitaries and heads of state, implying popularity and prestige.
* **D: Dagiti nabiit pay a naurnos a kuarto nga addaan kadagiti moderno a panagpabaro:** The passage explicitly says the hotels had ""kurang a baro a pasilidad"" and ""naisabsabali a naimnasna kinadaan,"" meaning they lacked modern amenities and had outdated rooms.



"
"Segun iti impormasion a naipresentar iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a maidiaya ti saan unay nga umuna a kitaen ti maysa a bisita ti hotel?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti antique a muebles iti tagikua (Antique furniture in the lobby)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions: ""Dagiti kadaanan a fitting, iti kurang a baro a pasilidad, ken naisabsabali a naimnasna kinadaan ket parte met iti pakailadawanna"" which translates to ""The fittings of the era, with a lack of new facilities, and the unusual layout were also part of their charm."" This directly implies that the antique furniture and the general aged appearance of the hotel were prominent features.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maysa a panganan nga addaan ti popular a tagaluto (A dish with a popular chef):** The text mentions ""naiimas a makan"" (delicious food) but doesn't specify a popular chef or a particular dish.
*   **C: Maysa a sala a mangidiaya ti kada rabii a mangliwliwa (A living room that offers a nightly spectacle):** While the hotels were grand, the text doesn't mention a specific nightly spectacle in the living room.
*   **D: Dagiti nalaka a rate iti kuarto (High room rates):** The text focuses on the hotel's historical charm and grandeur, not necessarily on the expense. While likely expensive, the high rate isn't a feature *seen* by a visitor upon arrival.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan a liklikan dagiti agbi-biahe a bumis-bisita iti Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: Panangtukoy ti native ti Greenland kas maysa nga “Eskimo”**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kung man mangngegam dagiti sasao nga us-usaren dagiti Katutubo ti Greenland, ti panagusar dagitoy ket masapul a liklikan dagiti dayo."" This means visitors should avoid using the term ""Eskimo"" to refer to Greenlanders.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti partikular a lugar a popular para kadagiti nangato a rate ti krimen:** The text states that crime is not seen in Greenland.
* **B: Panagitugot kadagiti nadagsen a bado, kas kadawyan a napudot ti klima iti kadagupan ti tawen:** While necessary, the text doesn't specifically say visitors should *avoid* these boots. It simply mentions needing insulated boots.
* **C: Panangnamnama nga agtrabaho online idiay, ta mabalin a saan unay a nasimpa ti koneksyon iti internet:** The text mentions potential internet connectivity problems but doesn't say visitors should *avoid* trying to work online.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kangrunaan nga agbalin a problema para kadagiti saan a nakasagana nga agbi-biahe a bumis-bisita ti Greenland?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti nordic a lamok (Nordic mosquitoes)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Uray no saanda a makaited iti aniaman a saksakit, makasinga dagitoy. **Lamok a Nordic**."" (Even if they don't cause any pain, they are annoying. **Nordic mosquitoes**.)

While other issues are mentioned (weather, lack of good places, potential for sleep problems), the mosquitoes are specifically highlighted as a bothersome aspect of visiting Greenland. The text also mentions that the Inuit have traditionally used birch bark to protect themselves from the mosquitoes.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maus-usar itan kas sentral a plaza?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Jardín de la Unión (Jardín de la Unión)**.

The first sentence of the text explicitly states: ""Nabangon daytoy a lugar a kas atrium para iti maika-17 siglo a kombento, a ti Templo de Sandiego ti kakaisuna a nabatbati a patakder."" which translates to ""This place arose as an atrium for a 17th-century convent, with the Templo de Sandiego as its main landmark.""  The Jardín de la Unión is the place being described as the central plaza.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a mabirukan iti Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti panganan a sango iti hardin (Food from the garden)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Adu dagti restaurant iti aglawlaw ti hardin..."" (There are many restaurants in the garden during the day...). It *doesn't* say there are restaurants serving *food from the garden*. The text mentions restaurants, but the source of the food isn't specified as being *from the garden*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti akintengnga a gazebo nga addaan kadagiti konsierto (The central gazebo with concerts):** The text says there are free concerts in the central gazebo at night.
*   **B: Ti pagtaengan ti agkakauna nga istoria ti ayat (The place where the story of a kiss happened):** The text explicitly mentions the two balconies connected by 69 cm as the location of the story of the kiss.
*   **D: Maysa a daan a kamarin ti kumbento (An old convent cellar):** The text mentions the ruins of the convent temple, but does not refer to any cellar.

Therefore, the only thing not mentioned as being found in the Jardín de la Unión is food directly *from* the garden.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti panaguli ti bantay iti aldaw ti maikonsiderar a saan a nakanatad?","The correct answer is **B: Agduduma dagiti kaadayo na, ngem naigandat met a masakup ti kalawa ti maysa nga aldaw.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ti panaguli iti bigat ket pakairamanan dagiti distansia a nakurang maysa a milya inggana iti ad-adayo a distansia a mabalin pagnaen iti maysa nga aldaw."" This directly supports option B. It acknowledges that distances vary but that a certain amount of ground can be covered in a day.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bassit laeng a panagsagana ti masapul para kadagiti panaguli iti aldaw kadagiti nalaka a pagnaan:** While the text mentions minimal gear, it also emphasizes the need for *more* gear for families with young children. This option is too simplistic.
* **C: Dagiti tattao a kalalaingan laeng ti lebel ti kinakaradkad a ket iti sapasap a maipapasda daytoy nga aktibidad:** The text explicitly says that families with young children need *more* preparation. This option is inaccurate.
* **D: Ti panag-hike iti aldaw ket saan a maibagay nga aktibidad iti ruar para kadagiti pamilia nga addaan ti maladaga:** The text doesn't mention anything about people with medical conditions. Therefore, this option is not supported by the given information.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a mangikasapulan ti bassit laeng a panagsagana ti panaguli ti bantay iti aldaw?","The correct answer is **A: No ti hiker ket pisikal a nakaradkad** (If the hiker is physically fit).

The passage states: ""Dagiti pamilia nga adda iti babassit nga ubbingna ket kasapulan ti ad-adu a panagsagana, ngem ti maysa aldaw a panagruar ket nalaklaka nga agbalin uray pay no adda ti tagibi ken uryet."" This implies that a physically fit person needs minimal exertion for a day hike. Option A best reflects this.
"
Ania ti sabali maipapan kadagiti plateau iti Rogaland wenno Agder a maiyasping iti sabali pay a lugar iti Norway?,"The correct answer is **A: Adda kaykayoda (They have rocks)**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""vidde"" are often described as barren, empty spaces without cover. It also mentions that in Rogaland and Agder, they are called ""hei"" and are described as ""bald, rocky expanses mainly covered in heather.""

Option A, ""Adda kaykayoda,"" directly contradicts the description of ""vidde"" as being barren and empty. This makes it the correct answer because it highlights a key characteristic of the plateaus in Rogaland and Agder that distinguishes them from other areas in Norway. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

*   **B: Awan dagiti fjord (They don't have fjords):** The text explicitly mentions fjords as a characteristic of Norway, so this is incorrect.
*   **C: Dagiti plateau ket kaaduan a napatad (The plateaus are mostly flat):** The text describes them as ""tantanap a pagammuan ta mangitunda iti nangato, napatpatad wenno saan unay a napatad a plateau"" (high plateaus that limit the flow of water, flat or not flat). This implies some variation in elevation, not necessarily flatness.
*   **D: Masansan a nakallubanda ti heather (They are often covered in heather):** The text says they are *mainly* covered in heather, not *often* covered, and also describes them as having rocks.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a normal para ti Norway?","The correct answer is **A: Silulukat a nalalawa a dagdaga (Extensive barren plains)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Norway has ""narangkis a fjord ken tantanap a pagammuan ta mangitunda iti nangato, napatpatad wenno saan unay a napatad a plateau."" It then defines these as ""vidde,"" which are described as ""nalawa, sipaparang nga espasio nga awan kaykayona, tangatang nga awan pagpatenggaanna"" - extensive, barren plains. 
* The text contrasts the ""vidde"" with the fjords and mountains, highlighting the unusual nature of these expansive, barren landscapes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti adu kaykayona a daga (Highly wooded land):** The text emphasizes the *lack* of trees in the ""vidde"" landscapes.
* **C: Dagiti narangkis a fjords (Rugged fjords):**  The text mentions fjords as a characteristic of Norway, not as something *abnormal*.
* **D: Dagiti moorland (Moorlands):** While ""vidde"" can be considered a type of moorland, the text specifically uses ""vidde"" to describe the unique, extensive barren plains of Norway. 

Therefore, the ""silulukat a nalalawa a dagdaga"" (extensive barren plains) is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Kaano a masapul a mapan ag-ski dagiti turista tapno mabisita dagiti istasion ti bantay?,"The correct answer is **A: Bayat ti panawen ti niebe**.

Here's why:

The question asks about when tourists need to go skiing to visit mountain stations.  Mountain stations are known for snow, and skiing is a snow-based activity. Therefore, the time of year with snow is the necessary condition to ski at these stations.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bayat ti panawen a kaaduan ti tattao:** While crowds might be a factor, it's not the primary requirement for skiing.
*   **C: Bayat ti kalgaw ti India:**  This refers to the general monsoon season, which is the opposite of the time for skiing.
*   **D: Bayat ti spring:** Spring can have snow in some mountain regions, but it's not a guaranteed time for skiing, and the snow conditions might not be ideal.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano nga adda ti kaaduan a turista kadagiti istasion ti bantay?","The correct answer is **D: Kabayatan dagiti bulan ti niebe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that winter is a good time to visit hill stations because of the snow. It mentions activities like skiing and snowboarding, which are possible *because* of snow.  Therefore, the question is asking about the duration of the snowy season, which is referred to as ""kabayatan dagiti bulan ti niebe"" (the duration of the months of snow).

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kabayatan ti napigsa a panagtinnag ti niebe** (Duration of frozen snowfall) - While related, it's not as encompassing as the entire snowy season.
* **B: Kabayatan ti panawen ti snowboarding** (Duration of the snowboarding season) - Snowboarding is an activity *possible* during the snowy months, but the question is broader.
* **C: Bayat ti kalgaw ti India** (Duration of the ice age in India) - This is not relevant; the passage focuses on winter and snow.



"
Ania ti rumbeng a liklikam nga aramiden no namnamaem a makasarakka iti bangka nga agsapsapul iti tulong?,"The correct answer is **A: Magna nga agpangato ken agpababa kadagiti pantalan** (Wait patiently and lower yourself to the dock).

Here's why:

The prompt describes a situation where you are volunteering to help sailors in need.  The core of the assistance is connecting people with ships needing help.  Waiting patiently and being ready to assist *at the docks* is the most logical first step to fulfilling this role. The other options are inappropriate:

* **B: Pannakigayyem kadagiti kapitan** (Appealing to captains) - This is too proactive and could be perceived negatively.  You're meant to be a facilitator, not someone directly demanding help.
* **C: Panangiyallukoy kadagiti serbisiom** (Promoting your services) - This is self-serving and doesn't align with the described helpful role.
* **D: Saan nga ikaso dagiti kapadam a hitchhiker iti balangay** (Don't allow unwanted hitchhikers on the ship) - This is irrelevant to the situation described, which is about *helping* people in need, not preventing them from boarding.



"
Ania ti rumbeng nga aramidem iti aglawlaw dagiti marina no agsapsapulka iti bangka a kasapulan ti tulong?,"The correct answer is **A: Makikontak kadagiti marinero** (Contact the sailors).

Here's why:

* **The original text describes the role of a ""marina"" (likely a maritime authority or similar role) as a point of contact for those needing help at sea.** The text explicitly states they can relay information, assist with communication, and coordinate assistance.
* **Option A directly aligns with this role.** Contacting the sailors is the logical first step to inform them of the situation and request assistance.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Agtalinaed iti uneg ti radar** (Stay inside the radar) - This is not a helpful action for someone needing assistance.
    * **C: Papanan laeng dagiti tattao bayat ti panagdalusda ti yate** (Just wait for people while cleaning the yacht) - This is passive and doesn't actively seek help.
    * **D: Liklikan dagiti kapadam a hitchhiker** (Avoid suspicious hitchhikers) - This is irrelevant to the situation of needing help with a disabled boat.



"
Ania a lugar ti mapag-interesan dagiti turista iti kolonial a pakasaritaan ti isla?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Northern shore**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Daytoy ti lugar nga inagom dagiti manangsakop a Briton ken no agbirbirokka iti ebidensia iti napalabas a panagsakop dagiti teritorio, nasayaat no mangrugika ditoy a lugar."" This translates to ""This place was occupied by the British colonizers, and if you want to find evidence of past colonial rule, it's a good place to start."" The northern shore is mentioned as the area where the British colonizers settled.



The other options are less directly related to the colonial history mentioned in the text:

*   **B: Ti Kowloon waterfront:** While Kowloon has historical significance, the text focuses on the northern shore as the primary area for colonial evidence.
*   **C: Ti Downtown Hong Kong:**  Downtown Hong Kong is described as a result of reclaimed land and isn't explicitly linked to the colonial era in the same way as the northern shore.
*   **D: Ti Victoria Harbor:** The harbor is a general landmark, but not the specific location where colonial history is best explored according to the text."
Ania a lugar ti makaited ti interes ti turista nga ipangpangrunana dagiti napipintas a makita?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti Isla iti Hong Kong**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Inikkkan ti Isla ti Hong Kong iti teritorio ti Hongkong...adu a turista a mangipagarup a kangrunaan a naipamaysa."" (The Island of Hong Kong is a territory of Hong Kong...many tourists come mainly to be met here.)
* It also highlights the iconic skyline and the Victoria Harbour as attractions *on* the Island of Hong Kong.
* While Victoria Harbour and Kowloon waterfront are mentioned as locations *within* Hong Kong, the overall focus and primary attraction described is the Island itself.

Therefore, the Island of Hong Kong is the most accurate and comprehensive answer.

Ania ti sumagmamano a saddle a makatulong a makissayan ti peggad ti saka ti sumakay a saan a maisigkat iti stirrup?,"The correct answer is **D: Ad-adda nga istabilidad (Additional stability)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how stirrups provide support but aren't foolproof. It mentions that a rider's boots and the girth straps help secure the saddle. However, it also states that the saddle can slip off the horse if the horse moves abruptly.

The question asks about saddle features that help secure the saddle *without* relying on stirrups.  The passage emphasizes the need for *additional* stability. While the other options are factors in securing a saddle, ""additional stability"" is the most comprehensive answer that addresses the core issue of preventing the saddle from slipping, especially when stirrups aren't being used.  A saddle designed for additional stability would be the feature helping the rider stay secure.



Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Dagiti naakikid a sole (Grippy soles):** While grippy soles are helpful for the rider's boots, they don't directly improve saddle security.
*   **B: Dagiti bar ti kinatalged (Additional straps):** Additional straps *could* provide more security, but the passage focuses on the *saddle itself* having a feature to improve stability, not just more straps.
*   **C: Dagiti leather a stirrup (Leather stirrups):** The passage actually mentions that leather stirrups *can* be helpful in securing the saddle through the girth straps. However, the question explicitly asks about features *without* stirrups.



"
Ania a langa ti botas a pangsakay ti makatulong iti kintalged ti sumakay no agus-usar kadagiti stirrup?,"The correct answer is **C: Maysa a heel** (A heel).

Here's why:

* The text states that riders often wear boots with a **heel** and a supple, gripping sole. The heel is crucial because it helps to keep the foot securely in the stirrup and prevents it from slipping through, especially when the horse is moving.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Nagurdo, a naakikid a sole** (A firm, gripping sole): While a gripping sole is helpful, it doesn't specifically address the issue of preventing the foot from sliding *up* and out of the stirrup.
* **B: Leather**: Leather can be part of the boot's construction, but it's the heel that provides the necessary support within the stirrup.
* **D: Maysa a nalawa a sole** (A double sole): The text doesn't mention or imply the importance of a double sole.



"
Ania ti maidiaya kadagiti biahero babaen kadagiti network iti pinagsisinnukat ti hospitalidad?,"The best answer is **C: Dagiti biahe nga ipaay dagiti lokal a mannarabay**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the benefits to travelers.** The passage describes these networks as connecting travelers with local hosts who offer accommodation.  Therefore, the direct benefit is getting a place to stay offered by locals.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Dagiti pagdagusan kadua dagiti lokal a mangpadagus:** While true, it's a consequence *of* the networks, not a direct benefit *to* the travelers.
* **B: Nalaka a biahe ti eroplano:**  The story of Casey Fento's flight is *the origin* of Couchsurfing, but it's not a benefit travelers receive *through* these networks.
* **D: Dagiti koneksion kadagiti sabali pay nga agbibiahe a bumis-bisita iti agpada a destinasion:**  While networks *can* lead to connections, it's not the primary or direct benefit described in the passage.


Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the information provided.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan kadagiti network ti hospitality exhange ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **B: Ti sumagmamano a network ket mabalin nga agkasapulan ti kanayonan a beripikasion kadagiti agbi-biahe.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Dagiti mabalin a mangpadagus ket maited a mabalin a kas naimprenta ken/wenno online, no maminsan adda pay panagsapul ken panangadal iti dadduma nga agbibiahe."" This implies that some networks *do* require more than just filling out an online form – they might need verification.
* Option A is not directly supported by the passage. While hosts might provide references, the text doesn't explicitly state that travelers are *always* given references.
* Option C is not mentioned in the passage.
* Option D, while plausible, isn't explicitly stated as a requirement or typical practice in the passage. The text focuses on the provision of lists of hosts and the possibility of online/printed profiles.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is that some hospitality exchange networks require more than just an online form for travelers.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a kita ti bisita ti basbassit ti posibilidadna a masarakan iti shared hostel room?","The correct answer is **C: Maysa a bisita nga agbi-biahe kadua dagiti babassit pay nga ubbing.**

Here's why:

The passage states that while the hostel is popular with young travelers (age 20-something), families with young children are typically accommodated in private rooms. This directly implies that it's *less likely* for a traveler with young children to stay in a shared hostel room.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maysa a bisita nga agtawen ti nasapa a bayinte:** People in their 20s are the *typical* age group for the hostel, so it's *more likely* they would be in a shared room.
* **B: Maysa a bisita nga agbi-biahe agmaymaysa:** Solo travelers are a common type of guest and could easily stay in a shared room.
* **D: Maysa a bisita nga agtawen ti tengnga ti trentan:** Travelers in their 30s are also likely to be in a shared room, as they are within the typical age range for the hostel.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti ad-adda a makitam a maturog iti maysa a hostel?","The correct answer is **B: Tallo nga agtawen ti 22 nga agbi-biahe nga agkakadua**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the hostel is primarily for young people (ages 20 and up), but adults travel there too.
* It also mentions that families with young children are generally accommodated in private rooms at other hostels.
* Option B aligns with this description: three people aged 22 traveling together fits within the age range and the likelihood of adults staying at the hostel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maysa nga agasawa kadua ti kaiyanak a maladaga** - While adults stay at the hostel, the mention of ""maladaga"" (sick) doesn't directly fit the general description.
* **C: Maysa nga agasawa nga agtawen ti 70** - While adults stay at the hostel, someone aged 70 is older than the primary target demographic and less likely to be described as a typical visitor.
* **D: Dua a pamilia nga agbi-biahe kadua dagiti annakda** - The passage explicitly states that families with young children are usually accommodated elsewhere. This option contradicts that information.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagibato ti boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: Agsubli latta daytoy iti imam no kusto ti pannakaibatona (It only returns if thrown correctly)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ti panangibato ti boomerang ket maysa a nalatak a paglaingan a kayat a magun-od ti adu a turista. Kaaduan a boomerang a magatang idiay Australia ket agpayso a saan agsubsubli. Masapul kadagiti agdadamo a saanda ipuruak daytoy no naangin."" (Throwing a boomerang is a popular pastime enjoyed by many tourists. Many boomerangs found in Australia do not return. Those who are not skilled must not throw it when windy.)
* The key point is that the boomerang *only* returns if thrown correctly.  The passage emphasizes the importance of proper technique for it to work.
* Options B, C, and D are either incorrect based on the passage (e.g., the passage implies the boomerang *is* popular with tourists, not just locals) or are too general to be the primary reason for needing to throw it correctly.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kangrunaan a maus-usar iti Javanese nga istilo ti panagluto?,"The correct answer is **C: Asukar manipud ti inyog**.

The text specifically states: ""...the Javanese hallmark is a preference for nuts, chili, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices."" This directly supports the answer.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano nga agwaras ti makaakar a sakit?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti pathogen**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Maigapu ti makaakar a sakit iti maysa a pathogen, kas iti virus, bacterium, fungus wenno dagiti sabali pay a parasitiko.""  This means infectious diseases are caused by pathogens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naimpeksionan a tattao:** While being infected is a *result* of a pathogen, it's not the *cause* of the disease.
* **C: Bacterium:**  Bacteria are *types* of pathogens, not the general cause of all infectious diseases.
* **D: Dagiti panagpabakuna:** Vaccines are a *prevention* method for infectious diseases, not the cause.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan nga ammo a gapu dagiti makaimpeksion a sakit?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti panagpabakuna (Vaccines)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that vaccines are a *solution* or a *preventative measure* for infectious diseases. It doesn't say that vaccines are *unknown* in relation to infectious diseases. The passage *does* mention viruses, bacteria, and fungi as causes of infectious diseases.

Therefore, the passage implies that vaccines are not unknown, but rather a means of combating these diseases.
"
Iti ania a kasasaad a naan-anay para ti mangus-usar a pilien ti web proxy ngem ti personal a tagaipaay ti VPN?,"The correct answer is **B: Pakaseknan ti mangus-usar ti panangliklik ti censorship ken panagespiya no mabalin.**

Here's why:

* **The question highlights the advantages of web proxies over VPNs for bypassing censorship and surveillance.**  The prompt explicitly states that VPNs are often criticized for being susceptible to IP-geofiltering and government/commercial censorship.  Web proxies can offer a layer of anonymity by masking the user's IP address, making it harder to track their online activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kayat ti mangus-usar nga i-reroute amin a trapiko:**  This describes a VPN, not a web proxy. VPNs are designed to reroute *all* internet traffic, while web proxies typically only handle traffic for specific applications (like a web browser).
* **C: Ti mangus-usar ket agdama a kangrunaan a mangire-reroute ti trapiko iti http:** While some web proxies primarily handle HTTP traffic, many can handle HTTPS traffic as well. This is not a defining characteristic that makes a proxy preferable to a VPN in the context of censorship/surveillance.
* **D: Dagiti aktibidad ti mangus-usar ket mangikasapulan ti kalalainganna agingga ti nangato a lebel ti bandwidth:** This option doesn't directly address the core reasons for choosing a web proxy.  High bandwidth needs are generally better suited for a VPN.

Therefore, the focus on bypassing censorship and surveillance makes option B the most accurate and relevant answer."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan kadagiti VPN ken web proxies ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti VPN ket maiyallatiwna laeng ti trapiko iti http**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Kabaelanda nga iyallatiw dagiti Internet traffic, saan laeng nga http."" (They can monitor Internet traffic, not just HTTP.) This implies that VPNs *can* monitor traffic beyond just HTTP, making option D incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti VPN ket kadawyan a mangidatag ti nangat-ngato a bandwidth ngem kadagiti web proxy.** The text states that web proxies typically consume more bandwidth, not VPNs.  So this is reversed.
* **B: Dagiti web proxy ket saanna a maiyallatiw amin a trapiko iti web.** The text implies that this is *a benefit* of web proxies (they can monitor all web traffic), not a drawback.
* **C: Dagiti web proxy ket addaan iti nababbaba a kalidad ti serbisio no maiyasping kadagiti VPN.**  The text suggests the opposite - web proxies offer better quality service than VPNs.



Therefore, the only statement contradicting the information given is that VPNs are limited to HTTP traffic."
Ania ti mangpalubos ti maysa a tao a mangusar ti kompania ti telepono iti ruar ti nagannat a lugarda?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti sangalubongan a numero ti telepono (Virtual phone numbers)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Masansan, masapul nga aggatangka ti nailasin a sangalubungan a numero a mabalin a matawaganka iti telepono a PSTN."" This translates to ""Often, you need to obtain a virtual phone number that can be called on the PSTN.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Dagiti nai-route ti internet a tawag (Routed internet calls)** While internet routing is involved, the passage emphasizes the *need* for a virtual number to connect to the traditional phone system (PSTN) from remote locations.
* **C: Dagiti satellite (Satellites)**  Satellites provide internet connectivity, but the passage focuses on how to make *phone calls* from remote locations.
* **D: Dagiti PSTN a telepono (PSTN phones)**  PSTN phones are traditional landlines. The point is that you *don't* necessarily need a PSTN phone to use a company's service in a remote location, but you often need a virtual number *to connect to* the PSTN.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan a maaramid tapno makaawat kadagiti partikular a tawag?","The correct answer is **A: Gumatang ti sangalubongan a numero (Get a toll-free number)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Masansan, masapul nga aggatangka ti nailasin a sangalubungan a numero a mabalin a matawaganka iti telepono a PSTN."" This translates to: ""Often, you need to get a toll-free number that can be called on a PSTN phone.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agusar ti lokal a kompania ti telepono (Use a local phone company):** The passage says you *don't* need a local phone company.
* **C: Gumun-od ti numero manipud ti lokal a komunidadmo (Get a number from your local community):**  This is directly contradicted by the text, which emphasizes the ability to choose a number from anywhere, regardless of location.
* **D: Gumatang ti PSTN a telepono (Get a PSTN phone):** The text discusses using a toll-free number *to be able to call on a PSTN phone*, not the other way around.

Therefore, getting a toll-free number is the solution described in the passage.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagebkas kadagiti Italian a sarita?,"The correct answer is **B: Kaaduan kadagiti sarita ket maiyebkas no kasanoda a maisurat.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what *doesn't* describe Italian pronunciation.** The initial statement in the prompt emphasizes that Italian pronunciation is *not* always a direct reflection of the spelling.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Ti doble nga r ket maiyebkas nga agsabali ngem ti maysa nga r (The double 'r' is pronounced differently from a single 'r):** This *is* true. The double 'r' is a rolled 'r', while a single 'r' is a softer, single tap.
* **B: Kaaduan kadagiti sarita ket maiyebkas no kasanoda a maisurat (Most words are pronounced as they are spelled):** This is **incorrect** and the opposite of the prompt's assertion. Italian pronunciation is notoriously different from spelling.
* **C: Dagiti sarita nga addaan kadagiti letra a c ken g ket mabalin a makatikaw (Words with the letters 'c' and 'g' can be tricky):** This is **true**. The 'c' and 'g' have different pronunciations depending on the following vowel.
* **D: Ti panagebkas kadagiti kaaduan a sarita ket agduduma depende iti sumaruno a vowel (The pronunciation of many words depends on the following vowel):** This is **true**. Vowel combinations significantly impact pronunciation in Italian.

Therefore, the only statement that *doesn't* accurately describe Italian pronunciation, based on the initial prompt, is option B.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a naggapuan a karakteristik ti Izmir sakbay ti moderno a panawen?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti sentro ti paggatangan (Business centers)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...ita ket baro, narang-ay, ken okupado a sentro ti negosio..."" (it is now a new, vibrant, and busy business center...). This directly supports option C.

While the other options are mentioned as *characteristics* of Izmir, they are not the *primary* defining characteristic of the city in modern times as highlighted in the text. The passage emphasizes its role as a business hub.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a karakteristik ti Izmir?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti siudad ket manglikmut iti dakkel a baybay (The city has forgotten the big bay).**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ita ket baro, narang-ay, ken okupado a sentro ti negosio, naipasdek iti aglawlaw ti dakkel a luek..."" which translates to ""...it is a new, vibrant, and busy business center, founded by the continuous growth of a large bay..."" This directly contradicts option A.

The other options are all mentioned in the text:

* **B: Ti atmosphere ket mangiyanninaw ti tradisional a Turkey (The atmosphere is reminiscent of traditional Turkey):** The text says, ""...uray no ti siudad mas addaan atmosperana a kasla Mediterranean Europe ngem tradisional a Turkey."" (even though the city has an atmosphere reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe but traditional Turkey).
* **C: Mabirukam dagiti moderno a sentro ti paggatangan ken dagiti daan a simbaan (Modern business centers and ancient churches are abundant):** The text states, ""Dagiti nalawa a kalsada, istruktura a sarming iti ruarna ken moderno a sentro ti paggatangan..."" (Old roads, structures with a column and modern business centers...).
* **D: Adda ditoy ti maikadua a kadakkelan a puerto iti Turkey (It has the second largest port in Turkey):** The text clearly says, ""Adda ditoy ti maikadua a kadakkelan a puerto iti Turkey"" (It has the second largest port in Turkey).



"
Ti sarita nga hanami ket maipapan ti panabuya ti ania?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti cherry blossom**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Ti panagbuya iti cherry blossom, maaw-awagan a hanami..."" which translates to ""The cherry blossom viewing, called hanami...""  The entire passage is about the tradition of viewing cherry blossoms. While other elements are mentioned, the core of the story is about the cherry blossoms themselves.
"
Siasino ti nag-host ti umuna a party a naidedikar ti panangkita kadagiti cherry blossom?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti emperador ti Hapon**.

The text states: ""Idiay Japan, dagiti pagraragsak para ti umuna a cherry blossom ket i-host ti **emperador** para laeng iti bagbagina ken dadduma a miyembro iti aristokrasia iti aglawlaw ti Imperial a Korte."" (In Japan, the celebrations for the first cherry blossoms were hosted by the **emperor** for only the imperial family and other members of the aristocracy to enjoy during the Imperial Court's spring.)
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga aspeto ti Jerusalem a saan unay a maka-interes iti turista?","The correct answer is **B: Ti estado kas ti kapital a siudad ti Israel**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that many nations and the United Nations *do not recognize* Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Therefore, the lack of recognition is a point of contention and isn't necessarily an *attractive* aspect for tourists, although it's certainly a significant part of the city's history and political landscape.  The other options are presented as reasons *why* Jerusalem *is* interesting to tourists.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas banag a popular iti Jerusalem?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti politikal nga impluwensia**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions Jerusalem's historical significance (""addaan nakaskasdaaw a pakasaritaan a mairaman iti rinibu a tawen"") and its religious importance (""nasantuan para iti tallo a monoteistiko a relihion...agserbi nga espiritual, relihioso, ken kultural a sentro"").
* The passage also highlights its appeal to tourists due to its attractions (""adu nga agkakauna, arkeolohia ken kultural a lugar"").
* While the passage mentions debates about its status as the capital (""kaadduan ti dadduma a nasion ken ti United Nations saanda a bigbigen daytoy a kas kapitolio ti Israel""), it doesn't focus on its *political influence* itself, but rather the *dispute* surrounding its political status.

Therefore, ""Ti politikal nga impluwensia"" (Political influence) is the least emphasized aspect of Jerusalem in the provided text. The other options are all directly addressed in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti agbi-biahe ti saan a makabenepisio ti panaggatang ti Wild Card?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa nga agbi-biahe nga agplan-plano a bisitaen ti National Park ken uray maysa pay a parke.**

Here's why:

The text states that the Wild Card allows access to *any* of the selected parks in South Africa.  Therefore, a traveler planning to visit more than one park would benefit from the Wild Card.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maysa a agbi-biahe nga agplanplano a sumarungkar iti adu a SANParks agingga a mabalin:** While a traveler planning to visit many parks *would* benefit, the Wild Card isn't specifically geared toward *continuously* visiting parks.  The wording suggests a single trip with multiple park visits.
* **B: Maysa nga agbi-biahe a bumis-bisita laeng iti Kruger National Park:** The Wild Card is beneficial for Kruger, but even more so for travelers planning to visit other parks.
* **C: Maysa nga addaan ti budget nga agbi-biahe a pakaseknanna dagiti mabayadan iti pagparadaan:**  The text mentions that National Parks have entrance fees and that Wild Cards are a way to help with conservation, but doesn't say the Wild Card is *only* for budget travelers.  It's a way to save money if you plan to visit multiple parks.



"
Ania kadagiti keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti wildfire ket agduduma kadagiti adu nga ecozone ti parke.**

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions the park is divided into 14 ecozones.** It then states that each ecozone supports different animal life.  A logical conclusion, and one explicitly supported by the text, is that wildfires (which are a natural part of the ecosystem) will also vary in their impact and frequency across these different ecozones.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Maikonsiderar dayoty kas kangrunaan nga atraksyon iti South Africa:** While the passage says it's a major conservation area and a SANParks park, it *doesn't* explicitly state it's the *primary* attraction of South Africa.
* **C: Daytoy ti kabassitan kadagiti South African National Park:** The passage states that it is one of the main National Parks in South Africa, so it's not the ""smallest.""
* **D: Maakses daytoy dagiti bisita babaen ti panaggatang ti Wild Card:**  The passage mentions the Wild Card as a way to access *multiple* parks, not just Kruger. While it's a relevant detail, it's not a fundamental characteristic *defining* the park.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti ad-adda mangigapu ti peggad para kadagiti umuli babaen kadagiti narangkis a paset ti bantay?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti nabasa a kondision (Wet conditions)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Adda maysa a bassit a kueba asideg idiay ngato a masapul a dalanan, daytoy ket medio nababa ken nailet. **Adda mabilin a nabasa a kondision**, ket aggannadka kadagiti parte a natadem, aglalo no nabasa, ket mabalin a nadaras a delikado daytoy."" (There's a small cave aside the path at the top that needs a descent, it's rather low and narrow. **There are remaining wet conditions**, and it can become slippery on the stonework, especially if wet, making it potentially dangerous.)

While the other options are mentioned as part of the terrain, the passage directly links *wet conditions* to the danger and slipperiness of the path. Therefore, wet conditions are the reason for the need to be cautious.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a manganninaw ti kangato ti bantay ti Machu Picchu a nailadawan iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti narangrangkis a paset ket ad-adda a delikado no nabasa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Adda maysa a bassit a kueba asideg idiay ngato a masapul a dalanan, daytoy ket medio nababa ken nailet. Naibagada, namnaem a maibusanka iti anges, ket aggannadka kadagiti parte a natadem, aglalo no nabasa, ket mabalin a nadaras a delikado daytoy."" (There is a small cave beside the peak that requires a path, it is rather low and narrow. It is evident to be slippery, and it can become very dangerous if wet, especially in the steep parts.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uray dagiti nakaradkad nga umuuli ket maibusan ti anges:** While the passage mentions slipperiness, it doesn't specifically say that even experienced hikers can't slip.
* **B: Awan dagiti handrail kadagiti narangrangkis a paset:** The passage actually states that ""kadagiti nangatngato a paset ket dagiti landok a kable ti mangmangted iti suporta a pagigianan"" (in the most steep sections, cables provide support).
* **C: Kasapulam a labsan iti kueba iti ngato:** The passage mentions a cave but doesn't describe it as ""rather narrow.""



Therefore, option D is the only one directly supported by the information in the passage."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti saan a kangrunaan a makan ti Majorcan nga istilo ti panagluto?","The correct answer is **C: Bukel**.

The text explicitly states that Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, potatoes, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.  Buckwheat is not mentioned as a primary ingredient."
"Segun iti impormasion iti mabasa, ania a keddeng maipapan kadagiti hangi a taraon ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Ti geothermal a hangi ket mabalin a mabirukan iti Rotorua**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Sumagmamano a lugar iti Rotorua ket mangmangted ti geothermal a hangi..."" (Several places in Rotorua have geothermal hangi...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti geothermal hangi ket mangus-usar kadagiti napudot a bato manipud ti puor tapno papuduten ti pit** - While the passage mentions geothermal heat and rocks, it doesn't specifically state the purpose is to cook food (pit). It says it's used for traditional cooking for dinner.
* **B: Ti hangi babaen kadagiti napudot a bato ket sidadaan iti Wellington** - The passage mentions hangi are found in Wellington, but it doesn't say that the geothermal hangi *uses* hot rocks that are *found* in Wellington. 
* **C: Dagiti natuno a pangrabii ket masansan a malutluto iti hangi** - The passage states hangi are often used for cooking dinner, but it doesn't explicitly say *cooked* dinner. It says they are used for traditional cooking *for* dinner.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga kas normal a wagas tapno mapapudot ti hangi pit?,"The correct answer is **C: Geothermal a pudot**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Daydiay nga abut ket mabalin a napapudot bayat iti napudot a batbato gapu iti apoy, wenno iti dadduma a lugar iti pudot a **geothermal** ket isu ti natural nga agpapudot dagiti lugar iti daga."" This directly links geothermal activity to the way hangi pits are naturally heated.

Options A, B, and D are listed as potential ingredients or materials for a hangi, but the question asks about something *unusual* that would cause the hangi pit to be heated.  The passage doesn't mention any unusual materials, but highlights geothermal heat as the *natural* way it's heated.
"
Ania ti mabalin nga agresulta ti naisingsingayan a panagbigbig manipud ti monghe wenno madre?,"The correct answer is **B: Panangkalub kadagiti abagam (Asking for punishment)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Iti parehas a linia, kasapulan para kadagiti lalaki a mangibado ti pantalon a malingdanna ti tumeng. Daytoy met ket mabalin a buloden aggapu iti magun-odan idiay pagserrekan ngem dayta a kawes ket saan a nalabaan kalpasan a mausar isu a mabalin a saanka a komportable a mangisuot kadagita a palda. Maysa a kadakkel ket mabalin iti amin!"" This implies that wearing inappropriately revealing clothing can result in being punished.

While the other options *could* be potential consequences, they aren't directly stated or implied by the passage.  The most direct consequence described is asking for punishment.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a banbanag ti bado ti saan unay a sidadaan a mabulod manipud ti monasterio? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti pantalon**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kasapulan para kadagiti lalaki a mangibado ti pantalon a malingdanna ti tumeng."" (It is necessary for men to wear trousers that cover their legs.) and later ""kasapulan para kadagiti babbai a mangibado ti palda."" (It is necessary for women to wear skirts).

Therefore, trousers are mentioned as a type of clothing required for men within the monastery, and the passage discusses the difficulties women face with skirts. The other options (shorts, kalub - which is a type of garment, but not specifically mentioned in the context of monastery rules) are not discussed in relation to monastery rules in the passage.
"
Kaano nga addaan ti maysa a bisita ti kaaduan nga oportunidad a makita dagiti bituen bayat ti panagbisita kadagiti lugar iti Antartica?,"The correct answer is **D: No ti lebel ti polusion iti silaw ket nababa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gapu ta ti lugar ket saan unay a natao, ket ngarud saan a masansan a parikut ti polusion ti lawag, mabalinmo pay ragsaken a buyaen dagiti bituen."" (Because the place is not densely populated, it is not easy to pollute the air, so you can also see the stars clearly.)

While options A, B, and C might contribute to seeing stars, the passage explicitly connects seeing stars with low light pollution. Option D directly addresses this connection. The other options are not mentioned as primary reasons for seeing stars in the provided text.

Kaano a saan a mabalin a maisukat ti satellite nga telepono iti maysa a cell phone?,"The correct answer is **A: No mabalin a malapdan ti sight line nga agturong iti satellite (If a clear line of sight to the satellite can be maintained).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that satellite phones require a clear line of sight to the satellite for communication.  The other options are not directly related to the core limitation of satellite phones as described:

*   **B: No adayo unay ti lokasion (If the location is very remote):** While satellite phones are *often* used in remote locations, remoteness itself isn't the primary reason they differ from cell phones. Cell phone coverage is simply absent in remote locations.
*   **C: No mausarto iti ruar (If it is used outdoors):** Cell phones *can* be used outdoors, and satellite phones are *often* used outdoors, but this isn't a defining difference.
*   **D: No ti panagbiahe ket mangikasapulan kadagiti partikular a kasapulan ti data (If the travel requires specific data needs):**  Both cell and satellite phones can be used for data, although satellite data might be slower or more expensive. The specific data needs of a journey aren't the reason for the fundamental difference in how the phones work.

Therefore, the ability to maintain a clear line of sight to the satellite is the crucial difference highlighted in the passage.



"
Kaano a maipangpangruna ti satellite a telepono ngem ti cell phone?,"The correct answer is **B: Bayat ti panagbalangay (During voyages)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that satellite phones are often used on pleasure crafts and expeditions requiring remote communication. Voyages, especially those at sea, are a prime example of situations where cell phone service is unavailable and a satellite phone is necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bayat ti panagbakasion iti siudad (During vacations in the city):** Cell phone service is generally readily available in cities, making a satellite phone unnecessary.
* **C: No saan a kasapulanen ti remote a data (If remote data is not needed):** The text mentions satellite phones are used for both voice calls and data, implying the need for remote data isn't the defining factor.
* **D: No ad-adda nga addaan ka ti naan-anay a masakupan ti cell phone (If you have good cell phone coverage):** This is the opposite of the situation where a satellite phone would be needed! The text highlights satellite phones as an alternative when cell service is unavailable.



"
Ti parikut ti ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nangigapu ti pannakaaramid ti Transnistria Republic?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekonomia**.

The text states: ""Pagsilpuan ti ekonomiya ket naisubli iti baet dagitoy dua a paset ti Moldova uray pay nagbalin ti politikal a negosasion."" This translates to: ""Economic ties were disrupted due to the two parts of Moldova despite political negotiations.""  Therefore, the economic impact is directly mentioned as a consequence of the Transnistria situation.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti adda iti Transnistria Republic a sabali manipud ti sabali pay a lugar ti intero a Moldova?  ,"The correct answer is **C: Panangbigbig ti UN (UN Recognition)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""nga addaan iti bukod a gobierno ken kuarta ngem saan a bigbigen ti aniaman a pagilian a miembro ti UN."" (that it has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the UN.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Lengguahe (Language):** While Russian is widely used in Transnistria, Romanian is the official language of Moldova, and the text doesn't say Transnistria has a *different* official language.
* **B: Relihion (Religion):** The text states that Orthodox Christianity is the primary religion in *Moldova* as a whole. It doesn't specify that Transnistria has a different religious composition.
* **D: Currency:** The text states that Transnistria has its own currency, which *is* a distinction. However, the lack of UN recognition is a more fundamental and defining difference.

Therefore, the lack of UN recognition is the most significant distinguishing characteristic of Transnistria compared to the rest of Moldova.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a bisitaen ti maysa nga agbi-biahe ti Montevideo no kayatda a liklikan dagiti naangin a kondision ti panawen?","The correct answer is **C: Bayat dagiti bulan ti kalgaw iti Northern Hemisphere**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere, and its seasons are opposite to those in the Northern Hemisphere. It also says the temperature is a comfortable +30°C.  The question asks when to avoid cold weather. The Northern Hemisphere's winter coincides with Montevideo's summer, and therefore, the best time to avoid cold weather would be during the Northern Hemisphere's winter, which is the Southern Hemisphere's summer - the time of the **Northern Hemisphere's winter (or the Southern Hemisphere's summer), also known as the Northern Hemisphere's winter.**
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a bisitaen ti agbi-biahe ti Montevideo no partial-da ti nalam-lammiis a klima?","The correct answer is **A: No kalgaw iti Montevideo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere and experiences seasons opposite to the Northern Hemisphere. It specifically mentions that during the Northern Hemisphere's winter, Montevideo experiences summer with temperatures around +30°C. This implies that **if you want to visit Montevideo during its ""partial-da ti nalam-lammiis a klima"" (which translates to a more moderate, pleasant climate), you should travel during its summer, which coincides with the Northern Hemisphere's winter.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: No kalgaw iti Northern Hemisphere:** While the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing winter, this doesn't directly relate to the best time to visit Montevideo for pleasant weather.
* **C: No panawen ti tudo iti Montevideo:** The passage states there are no distinct ""hot"" and ""cold"" seasons, meaning there's no specific ""winter"" in Montevideo to aim for.
* **D: No panawen ti niebe iti Northern Hemisphere:** Snow in the Northern Hemisphere doesn't directly impact the weather in Montevideo.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mainaig ti nalaing nga artista ti graffiti, kas maisuppiat ti bandalismo?","The correct answer is **C: Saan nga ipangpangruna a mural iti publiko a tagikua**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Nupay kasta, kadagitoy nga aldaw addan dagiti naestablisar a graffiti artist, graffiti events, ken dagiti """"legal” a pader a pagsuratsuratan."" This means there's a distinction being made between illegal graffiti and established, sanctioned graffiti art.
* The passage further says, ""Iti daytoy a konteksto, masansan a kaasping dagiti graffiti painting dagiti obra ti arte imbes a kas di maaw-awatan a suratsurat."" This reinforces the idea that some graffiti is viewed as art.
* Options A, B, and D (pasamak ti graffiti, scribble, saan a mabasa a tag) all imply vandalism or unwanted markings, which the passage explicitly contrasts with the work of established artists.
* Option C, ""Saan nga ipangpangruna a mural iti publiko a tagikua"" (essentially, not primarily an unauthorized mural in public space), best captures the idea of legal graffiti – it's a mural, it's public, but it's authorized.

Therefore, the passage suggests that the professional graffiti art scene, including legal murals, is distinct from the vandalism that graffiti often initially represents.
"
Ania nga aspeto dagiti fiesta ti musika ti ikonsiderar dagiti mapmapan a napateg a paset ti kapadasan?,"The correct answer is **D: Pannakastrek a nasapa (The feeling of being immersed)**.

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes that a key element of a successful music festival is creating an experience where attendees feel truly immersed in the music and the overall atmosphere. It mentions the desire to ""really experience the action"" and ""feel the impact of the music.""
* While options A, B, and C might be aspects of some festivals, they aren't the central point the passage is making about what makes a music festival a significant and memorable experience.  The passage highlights the overall *feeling* and the immersive nature of the event.

Therefore, ""Panakastrek a nasapa"" (the feeling of being immersed) best captures the main point.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti rumbeng nga ipangpangruna ti festival attendant no kayatda ti agkampo iti asideg ti musika?","The correct answer is **D: Pannakastrek a nasapa (Being able to stay up late)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Laglagipen nga uray pay nalpasen ti panagtokar ti musika kadagiti kangrunaan nga entablado, mabalin nga adda pay dagiti paset ti piesta nga agtultuloy nga agpatpatokar agingga iti kaadalman ti rabii."" (Remember that even after the music stops on the main stage, there may still be parts of the festival continuing to play until the early hours of the morning.)

This implies that festival attendees who want to enjoy the music should be prepared to stay up late. Option D, ""Pannakastrek a nasapa,"" best reflects this requirement.  The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Panagapan iti naladaw a rabii (Staying up all night):** While related, it's not the *primary* consideration.  The text emphasizes the festival continuing *until* early morning.
*   **B: Panagtalinaed iti lugar para kadagiti pamilia (Staying in a place for families):**  This refers to a specific area for families with young children, not the general experience of festival attendees wanting to stay up late.
*   **C: Panagkampo iti saan iti site (Camping off-site):** The passage mentions camping *within* the festival site for families."
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ti liklikan dagiti bisita no agbirbirokda ti biag iti rabii iti amianan ti New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti babassit a lugar iti pagraragsakan (The small towns/places to stay)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Dagiti babassit a lugar iti pagraragsakan ditoy ket saan a kanayon a nasayaat a lugar a pagnaedan dagiti bisita a aggapu iti ruar ti estado."" (The small places to stay here are not always good places for visitors from out of state.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti pueblo (The Pueblos):** The text says that people *need* to travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe from the Pueblos to have a good nightlife. It doesn't suggest that the Pueblos are a good place to stay for nightlife.
* **D: Dagiti casino (The Casinos):** While casinos offer nightlife, the text warns that staying in the small towns is not always good. It implies the casinos might be part of the problem with the small towns.
* **C: Dagiti mall (The Malls):** The text doesn't mention malls as a nightlife option.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno a makabirok ti bisita kadagiti popular a panangliwliwa iti amianan ti New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: Iti casino asideg ti Sante Fe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nupay kasta, agiserbi iti inumen ti dandani amin kadagiti nailista a casino iti ngato, ken sumagmamano kadagitoy ti addaan nalalatak a brand ti paglinglingayan (nangruna dagiti dadakkel a casino a nakapalawlaw iti Albuquerque ken Santa Fe)."" (However, they also serve alcohol in all the listed casinos in the north, and some of them have notable entertainment brands (mainly the large casinos spread out in Albuquerque and Santa Fe).)
* **The question asks:** Where can visitors find popular entertainment in Northern New Mexico?
* **Option C directly aligns with the passage** by mentioning casinos near Santa Fe as a place for entertainment. Options A and B are not supported by the passage. Option D is explicitly stated as *not* a good place for out-of-state visitors due to driving issues and low-cost drinking.



"
Dagiti addaan ti strikto a budget nga agbi-biahe ket mabalin a kayatda a maliklikan ti ania a tipo ti mainum?,"The best answer is **C: Lokal a serbesa (Local beer)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ti lokal a serbesa ket “Numero Uno”, saan a komplikado daytoy a serbesa, ngem nasayaat ken makapresko."" This implies it's a good value.
* **The text mentions:** ""Ti lokal a danum ti gripo ket natalged nga inumen..."" This means bottled water isn't necessarily the most budget-friendly option.
* **The text describes:** ""Ti napudot a tsokolate ket depende iti pagalagadan ti Belgian."" This is a luxury item, not for someone on a strict budget.
* **While the text mentions Australian wine, it doesn't directly state it as a budget option.**  Local beer is presented as a simple, affordable choice.

Therefore, a local beer is the most logical choice for someone traveling on a strict budget.
"
"Segun iti lugar a nailadawan iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga order ti mainum ti makatikaw iti maysa a tagaserbi?","The correct answer is **A: Ti ababa a nangisit (The short black)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Para kadagiti Australiano, ganggannaet ti kapanunotan a 'daplat a puraw' a kape. 'Espresso' ti ababa a nangisit...""  This translates to ""For Australians, the motto is 'short black' coffee. 'Espresso' is a short black...""  Therefore, the short black is a common and recognizable order in the described location (Australia).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Ti Numero Uno (Number One):** This is a local beer, and while enjoyable, it's not a universally understood drink order like the short black.
*   **C: Maysa a Sauvignon Blanc manipud ti New Zealand (A Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand):**  While New Zealand wines are mentioned, specifically ordering a Sauvignon Blanc is less likely to be a default or universally understood order compared to the short black.
*   **D: Ti daplat a puraw (The short black):** This is a description of a coffee and not an order given to a server."
"Nagpaut iti tallo a siglo, ti panawen ti kolonisasion ket nirugianan ti ania a grupo?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti Kastila (The Spanish)**.

The passage states: ""Dagiti Español inrugida ti panawen ti panagsakopda a nagtultuloy iti tallo a siglo."" which translates to ""The Spanish initiated the period of colonization which continued for three centuries.""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasayaatan a wagas a makatungtong ti nasayaat ti maysa a Parisian?","The correct answer is **A: Padasen a tuladen ti ugali ti maysa a Parisian (Imitate the manners of a Parisian).**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the key to fitting in with Parisians is **""la ta panagsingsingpetmo, agbalinka a kasla maysa a “bien élevé” (nasayaat a dimmakkel).""** This translates to ""your way of dressing, becoming like a 'bien élevé' (well-bred) person.""  This implies mirroring the customs and manners of Parisians.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Mangipakita ti pammati ti bagim (Show your respect):** While showing respect is generally good, the passage focuses specifically on Parisian *manners* and *appearance*.
* **C: Agbalin a nadayaw (Become dignified):** Dignity is a result of many things, but the passage doesn't directly link it to the core requirement for fitting in.
* **D: Mangipakita ti mannakigimong a panagtignay (Show a polite demeanor):** Similar to B, politeness is important, but the passage emphasizes adopting Parisian *manners* overall.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a stereotypical a kalidad dagiti Parisian?","The correct answer is **D: Kinamadagdagus (Boorishness)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the stereotype of Parisians being rude and haughty (""bagida laeng ti pampanunotenda, bastos ken napangas"") is **not entirely true** (""Uray pay daytoy ket kaaduanna ket saan nga umno""). It then goes on to say that the key to fitting in is appearing refined and well-mannered (""agbalinka a kasla maysa a “bien élevé”""). Therefore, being boorish (kinamadagdagus) is the opposite of the desired impression and thus not considered a stereotypical quality to *emulate*.

The other options (A, B, and C) are directly mentioned as aspects of the stereotype.
"
Ania ti benepisio ti First Class iti MetroRail ti Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: Awan unay tattao**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mas kumportable ken awan unay taona iti Metroplus..."" which translates to ""More comfortable and less crowded on Metroplus..."". This directly indicates that a key benefit of the First Class (MetroPlus) is the lack of crowds.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti coach ket adda iti sango ti tren** (The coach is on the top of the train): The passage doesn't mention anything about the location of the First Class coach.
* **C: Nalaklaka ngem ti Third Class a tiket** (Expensive but a Third Class ticket):  The passage says the ticket is *like* a normal European metro ticket, implying it's not expensive.
* **D: Agpada ti presiona iti tiket iti Metro** (The price is the same as a Metro ticket): The passage indicates that the price is *normal* for the Metro, but not necessarily the same.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti addaan ti tunggal aglug-lugan iti tren iti Cape Town?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti First ken Third class a coach**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kada tren ket adda MetroPlus ken Metro a lugan..."" (Every train has MetroPlus and Metro coaches...).
* MetroPlus is referred to as ""Primera Klase"" (First Class) and Metro is referred to as ""Maikatlo a Klase"" (Third Class).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Awan unay tattao a coach ti Metro** - The passage states there *are* Metro coaches.
* **B: Agpada ti presio ti tiket para ti dua a class** - The passage doesn't mention anything about ticket prices being the same.
* **C: Tallo nga agduduma a class** - The passage only mentions two classes: MetroPlus and Metro.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga aramiden ti peste nga animal?,"The correct answer is **B: Mangirita kadagiti allergy**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what a *pest* animal *doesn't* do. The passage states that pests cause irritation, allergies, ear infections, and can transmit diseases or cause injury.
* **Mangigapu ti gatel-gatel (Cause itching)**, **Mangiwaras ti impeksion (Cause infection)**, and **Mangigapu kadagiti napigsa a pannakadunor (Cause severe injuries)** are all actions of pests according to the text.
* **Mangirita kadagiti allergy (Cause allergies)** is listed as *one of the things pests DO*, not don't do. Therefore, it is the correct answer to the question of what a pest animal *doesn't* do.



"
Sadinno a mabalin a magatang dagiti kard ti prepaid a telepono?,"The best answer is **C: Kadagiti tiendaan iti igid (Convenience stores)**. 

Here's why:

* The text describes prepaid phone cards as widely available. Convenience stores are a very common place to find prepaid phone cards.
* While the text mentions cards are used on both payphones and regular phones, this doesn't necessarily indicate *where* to buy them.
* Options A and B are too specific. While some countries might have specific places, and some train stations might sell them, it's not a universal location.
* Option D (payphone) is where the cards are *used*, not where they are *bought*.



Therefore, convenience stores are the most likely and general place to purchase prepaid phone cards.



"
Kasano a maakses dagiti maymayat a rate ti tawag nga idiaya ti sumagmamano a kard?,"The correct answer is **B: Babaen kadagiti libre ti tollna a numero**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti akses kadagitoy a serbisio ket masansan a babaen ti toll-free a numero ti telepono a mabalin a maawagan nga awanan bayad manipud iti kaaduan a telepono."" (Access to these services is often through a toll-free phone number that can be called without charge from most phones.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maaksesda laeng kadagiti paritkular a pagilian:** While some cards *do* offer special rates to specific countries, the passage doesn't say *that's* how you access the good rates in general.
* **C: Iti tiendaan iti igid:**  The passage doesn't mention buying the cards in stores.
* **D: Babaen ti panagusar ti pay phone ken panagbayad ti kanayonan a masingir:** This is not mentioned in the passage and contradicts the common understanding of prepaid phone cards.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a kaykayo ti saan unay a kadawyan iti Plitvice Lakes national park?","The correct answer is **B: Oak**.

The text states that the national park is mainly composed of beech, spruce, and fir. Oak is not mentioned as a prominent tree species.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti narasay nga ayup a mabirukan iti nasional a parke ti Plitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""Kadua pay ti adu a sapasap a klase. Ti narasay nga ayup a kas kadagiti maradaga nga oso ti Europeo, lobo, agila, puwek, lynx, barang a pusa ken **capercaillie** ket makita sadiay..."" 

The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti maitulong ti code iti rehion?","The correct answer is **B: Panagkontrol ti merkado**.

The provided text states: ""ang pinakaimportante ay ang pagbibigay sa mga kumpanya ng mas maraming kontrol sa merkado; lahat ng ito ay tungkol sa pag-ikot ng pera."" This directly supports the idea that the main purpose of the region codes is to gain more market control. While the text mentions ""malapped ti panagpirata"" (reduce piracy), it frames this as a justification for market control, not the primary benefit of the codes themselves. The text also explicitly states that region codes are ineffective against illegal copying.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga agpaypayso maipapan kadagiti code ti rehion nga itultuloy dagiti kompania ti pagiwarnak?","The correct answer is **A: Napategda para ti pannakagun-of ti ad-adu a kontrol iti merkado.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""kangrunaan a kaipapananna ket ti panangted kadagiti kumpania ti ad-adu a kontrol ti merkado; maipapan amin daytoy iti panangpaikot ti kwarta."" (The main reason is to give companies more control over the market; it's all about making money.)

While the passage mentions ""malapped ti panagpirata"" (reduce piracy) and ""makatulongda a maliklikan ti saan a legal a panagkopia"" (help prevent illegal copying) as claims made by companies, it dismisses them as not being the *real* reason for enforcing region codes.  It argues these are just justifications to exert market control and make more money.

Therefore, option A directly reflects the passage's main argument about the true motivation behind region codes.
"
"No sumangpet iti pagtataengam a pagilian, ania a proseso ti kadawyan a saan a sinsinan?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti panangkita ti imigrasion (Immigration inspections)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about a standard process upon entering a country.** Immigration inspections are the standard procedure you encounter when entering a new country to determine your admissibility.
* **Option B (Panangiwaragawag kadagiti banbanag - Customs declaration)** is important, but it's not the *primary* process upon entering the country; it comes *after* immigration inspection.
* **Option C (Dagiti legal a limitasion dagiti banbanag - Legal limitations of bans)** is too specific and doesn't represent a general process.
* **Option D (Dagiti kontrol ti customs - Customs controls)** is also important, but again, it's a distinct step *after* the immigration inspection.

The passage explicitly mentions immigration inspections as a key component of the process and a point where customs control might be more difficult. Therefore, immigration inspections are the most relevant and standard process mentioned in relation to entering a country.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kasapulam a maamuan sakbay ti panagawid iti pagiliam?,"The best answer is **B: No kasapulan nga ibagam ti aniaman a nalabes iti legal a keddeng.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks about things to know *when crossing a border*.** Option B directly addresses a key aspect of border crossing: understanding what items are prohibited.  This is crucial for avoiding problems with customs.
* **The prompt states that customs control can be difficult if you don't declare items.** Knowing what you *must* declare is vital to avoid penalties or legal issues.
* **While A and C are related to the process, they aren't the *core* knowledge you need *before* crossing.** You'll encounter checkpoints and customs, but understanding what's allowed/disallowed is paramount.
* **D is too vague.**  While it's true there are things you can't bring, the phrase ""aniaman a banbanag nga itugotmo a madi mabalin"" is grammatically awkward and doesn't accurately capture the essential point.

Therefore, option B is the most relevant and important piece of information to know when crossing a border.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti kaadu ti ania a banag ti mangpalubos kadagiti umuli nga agtul-tuloy a makasukisok kadagiti baro a ruta iti uneg ti Cochamó Valley?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti diding (The walls)**.

The passage states: ""Dagiti mangnguli nga aggapu iti amin a parte ti lubong nga agar-aramid kadagiti kabarbaro a pagnaan kadagiti awan ungtona a mabalin a pagdalanan a didingna."" This translates to ""Climbers from all parts of the world come to make new ascents on its seemingly impossible walls.""  Therefore, the walls are what climbers are scaling.
"
"Segun iti impormasion a naipaay iti mabasa, siasino ti mangsakup kadagiti kaaduan a panagballasiw iti Southern Hemisphere?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

The text states: ""Star Alliance ket abbonganna amin puera iti makindaya nga abagatan a Pasipiko aggapu iti Santiago de Chile agingga iti Tahiti..."". This indicates that Star Alliance has the most extensive network in the Southern Hemisphere in that specific region. While the text mentions limitations for other alliances, it highlights Star Alliance's coverage in the South Pacific.
"
Ania nga alyansa ti airline ti mangsakup ti kabassitan a kaadu ti panagballasiw ti taaw iti Southern Hemisphere?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Star Alliance ket abbonganna amin puera iti makindaya nga abagatan a Pasipiko aggapu iti Santiago de Chile agingga iti Tahiti..."" which translates to ""Star Alliance covers everything except the far southern Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti..."" This indicates Star Alliance has the most extensive route network in the Southern Hemisphere.
"
Ania nga organisasion ti tour ti nangsukat ti Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage states: ""Ti nagtawid ti Global Running Tours, pagsilpuen ti Go Running Tours ti dose-dosena a mangmangted ti sightrunning iti uppat a kontinente."" This translates to: ""The Global Running Tours group, encompasses Go Running Tours with a dozen guides specializing in sightrunning across four continents.""

Therefore, Go Running Tours is the organization that encompasses Global Running Tours.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti Go Running Tours ket makatulong a mangikonektar ti mano nga agduduma a sightrunning nga organisasion?","The correct answer is **C: Dose-dosena**.

The text states: ""Ti nagtawid ti Global Running Tours, pagsilpuen ti Go Running Tours ti **dose-dosena** a mangmangted ti sightrunning..."" which translates to ""The Global Running Tours umbrella includes Go Running Tours, which unites a **dozen** sightrunning guides..."".

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uppat** (Eight) - The text doesn't mention eight.
* **B: 200** - The text says the umbrella includes 200 organizations, but this refers to tour operators, not guides.
* **D: Tallo** (Three) - The text doesn't mention three.
"
Ania ti masapul nga aramiden ti turistano namnamaenda ti kalawagan a mabalin a pannakakita ti maysa a cheetah?,"The correct answer is **A: Mapan iti hiking safari**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iti mapagpagna a safari (maawagan met a “bush walk”,“hiking safari”, wenno mapan ag-“footing”) iramanna ti panaguli, para iti mano laeng nga oras wenno mano nga al-aldaw.""  This means a hiking safari (bush walk) is a type of safari that involves walking and exploring the area. Cheetahs are often seen during these types of safaris, as they are found in the bush.

While you *might* see a cheetah using binoculars or from a vehicle, the passage specifically links cheetah sightings with hiking/bush walks.  Using binoculars or a vehicle doesn't inherently guarantee a sighting in the same way a walking safari might.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti ay-ayup ti nalabit a makita ti bisita bayat ti safari excursion iti maysa a lugan?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti leon**.

The text states: ""Dagiti leon, cheetah, ken leopardo no maminsan ket managbabain ket nasaysayaat ti pannakakita kadakuada no agusar iti largabista.""  This translates to ""Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes descend and it's enjoyable to see them using a vehicle.""  Therefore, lions are specifically mentioned as a commonly seen animal during a safari. While the other animals are mentioned, lions are the most explicitly highlighted.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mangpababa iti gastos iti panag-tour?","The correct answer is **C: Panagapan kadua ti maysa pay a tao**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""isu a no maymaysaka wenno maysa laeng ti kaduam, padasem ti makiam-ammo iti dadduma pay a tattao ken mangbukelkayo iti grupo nga uppat agingga iti innem ti miembrona **tapno nalaklaka ti bayadan ti tunggal maysa**."" This means that splitting the cost with one more person (making a group of two) makes it more affordable for each individual.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagapan nga agmaymaysa:** While traveling together *can* potentially save money, the text focuses specifically on the impact of the group size.
* **B: Panagbirok ti grupo ti uppat:**  The text suggests a group of 4-6 to split costs, but it doesn't say that a group of 4 is *the* way to reduce costs.  It's about finding other people to share the expense.
* **D: Panagbirok ti grupo ti innem wenno ad-adu pay:**  This would actually *increase* the cost per person.

"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti nalabit nga ipangrunada ti makaala ti kasayaatan a rate ti panag-tour?","The correct answer is **C: Dua nga aggayyem nga agbi-biahe nga agkadua**.

Here's why:

The passage states that tour operators often inflate prices for smaller groups (one or two people) and encourage people to join larger groups of four to six to make the price more affordable. 

Option C, ""Dua nga aggayyem nga agbi-biahe nga agkadua"" (Two couples traveling together), represents a group of four, which is a size that would likely be more cost-effective than a group of one or two. Therefore, they would likely receive a better rate.

The other options are less likely:

* **A: Dagiti turista a mayat nga ag-shuffle car** (Tourists who are good at shuffling cars) - This is not directly mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Maysa a grupo ti tallo** (A group of three) - This is still too small for the operator to offer the best price.
* **D: Maysa a grupo ti lima** (A group of five) - While better than one or two, it's not as good as a group of four, and the operator might still not offer the absolute best price.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti nangipaay ti sangalubongan a pannakabigbig iti San Francisco?","The correct answer is **A: Ti masansan a kaadda dagiti porma ti artes ken pagiwarnak**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nakatulong ti kanayon a pannakailadawanna kadagiti musika, pelikula, literatura ken nalatak a kultura tapno mabigbig ti siudad ken dagiti pagpasiaranna a nalatak iti sibubukel a lubong.""  This directly links the city's cultural offerings (music, film, literature, and art) to its global appeal.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ti kapipintasan a pasilidad ti convention:** While San Francisco *does* have convention facilities, the passage doesn't highlight them as the primary reason for its global appeal.
*   **C: Ti ekonomiko a dibersidad:** The passage mentions economic diversity but doesn't directly tie it to the city's global appeal.
*   **D: Ti rumrumsua a kasaaad ti Asiano a makan:** The passage mentions the variety of Asian food, but again, it's not presented as the main driver of global recognition.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti San Francisco ti saan nga agppaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Ti intero nga ekonomia ket agdepdepende iti turismo.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bayat iti ekonomia ti San Francisco ket nainaig ti pannaka primera klase a pagpasiaran dagiti turista, **itin ekonomia ket nadumaduma.**"" 

This means the economy isn't solely dependent on tourism. It has a diverse range of sectors. Options A, B, and C are all mentioned as positive aspects of San Francisco, aligning with the text. Option D directly contradicts the information given in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti biahero ti saan unay a makabenepisio ti panagusar kadagiti serbisio ti ahente iti panagbiahe?","The correct answer is **B: Maysa a nabulanos a biahero** (A well-prepared traveler).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that travel agents are most beneficial for travelers who need help with planning and logistics.  A ""well-prepared traveler"" likely handles all of these aspects themselves – booking accommodations, transportation, and visas – and wouldn't need the assistance of a travel agent.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Maysa a saan a makadesision a biahero (A traveler who can't decide):** This is exactly the type of traveler who would benefit from an agent's guidance.
*   **C: Maysa a biahero a saan pay a nakaseguro ti visana (A traveler who hasn't yet secured their visa):**  Travel agents can help with visa information and potentially assist in the process.
*   **D: Maysa a biahero a mangipangruna ti ag-book kadagiti package deal (A traveler who prioritizes booking package deals):** While travel agents offer packages, a traveler who specifically seeks those deals might be able to find them independently.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas benepisio ti panag-book babaen ti ahente ti panagbiahe?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti napapartak a dokumento ti panagbiahe (Travel documents)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Mabalinda pay nga ipasardeng ti reserbasinmo no masapulmo pay ti oras tapno panunotem ti ididiayada wenno mangala kadagiti sabali a dokumento para iti papanam (kas koma iti visa)."" This directly refers to assistance with travel documents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti deal iti hotel (Hotel deals):** The text mentions agents booking at hotels but doesn't promise special deals.
* **C: Mairaman iti amin a package (Include everything in a package):**  While agents offer packages with transportation, meals, etc., the text emphasizes that the *package itself* is what's beneficial, not just *including everything*.
* **D: Panangitantan ti panagreserba (Booking assistance):**  While booking assistance is *part* of what agents do, the text focuses on the *added benefits* beyond just the booking itself, specifically the document and logistical help.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti saan a kabaelan ti aplikasion para ti real-time text translator?","The correct answer is **B: Ipatarus ti intero a sasao ti teksto**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti dadduma nga aplikasion iti daytoy a kategoria, mabalinda pay nga ipatarus kadagiti **teksto** iti ganggannaet a pagsasao..."" (Different applications in this category can also translate **texts** into various languages...).  This implies they don't necessarily translate *entire* sentences, but rather smaller chunks or individual words/phrases within a text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ipatarus dagiti pagilasinan iti ganggannaet a pagsasao** - The passage confirms this ability.
* **C: Ipatarus ti teksto kadagiti banbanag babaen ti smartphone** - The passage confirms this ability.
* **D: Ipatarus a kusto iti 100% ti tunggal kanito** - The passage explicitly states that the translation isn't always perfect and can sometimes be incorrect.



"
Ania ti mangpalubos kadagiti pannakaipatarus a maaramid offline?,"The correct answer is **C: Panag-download ti datos ti lengguahe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Google Translate, a mabalin a mausar a pagipatarus uray awan ti Internet no la ket naidownloaden ti kasapulan a lengguahe.""  This directly indicates that downloading language data allows for offline translation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti napasayaat nga engine ti pannakaiparatus:** While good engines are important, they don't enable offline translation. The data needs to be *available* to the engine.
* **B: Dagiti smartphone:** Smartphones are the *device* used, but it's the downloaded data that makes offline translation possible.
* **D: Dagiti aplikasion iti agpaypayso iti oras a kategoria ti pannakaipatarus:** This is too broad. While the apps exist, it's the data they carry (downloaded language data) that's crucial for offline use.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a trigger para ti avalanches?,"The correct answer is **A: Napigket a niebe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Saabangan ti avalanche ket kung ti niebe ket napigket."" (Avalanches happen when the snow is unstable.)

The passage also mentions other triggers, but the question asks for *non*-triggers. People, sunlight, and heavy snowfall are all listed as *potential* triggers.  Therefore, unstable snow is the condition that *must* be present for an avalanche, not a trigger *of* one.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti agbaba kas avalanches?","The correct answer is **C: Surok a kaadu ti niebe kadagiti narangkis a bakras**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti problema ket nakapet ti niebe, isu a masapul nga adda manggaraw iti daytoy tapno agpababa, ken mabalin a ti dadduma a niebe nga agpababa ti manggaraw iti dadduma a niebe."" This indicates that a significant accumulation of snow on unstable slopes is a primary factor in triggering avalanches.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Napigket a niebe a saan a na-trigger:** While this can contribute to avalanche risk, the passage focuses on the *amount* of snow and slope instability.
*   **B: Narangkis a bakras nga awanan ti niebe:** This describes a different type of hazard (e.g., rockfall) and is not directly related to avalanche formation as described in the text.
*   **D: Niebe a saan a nagaraw dagiti tattao:** This is not a factor mentioned or implied in the passage.  The passage focuses on the snowpack itself, not whether humans have interacted with it.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti curry ket base ti ania a lalaok?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti herb ken spices**.

The passage states: ""Ti curry ket mabalin a “namaga” wenno “nabasa” depende ti kaadu ti danumna. **Gagangay a mausar ti yogurt kadagiti potahe a curry** iti nauneg a rehion iti Umamianan nga India ken Pakistan; **iti Umabagatan nga India ken sumagmamano a rehion iti igid ti baybay ti subkontinente, getta ti niog ti gagangay a masansan a mausar.**""  

The core ingredients mentioned as being used *in* curry are herbs and spices. While yogurt and coconut are sometimes used, they are *additions* or alternatives, not the base.
"
"Kadagiti partikular a rehion, ti gatas ti inyog ket no maminsan maus-usar a kasukat ti ania a laok iti curry?","The correct answer is **C: Yogurt**.

The text states: ""Kadagiti nauneg a rehion iti Umamianan nga India ken Pakistan, gagangay a mausar ti yogurt kadagiti potahe a curry; iti Umabagatan nga India ken sumagmamano a rehion iti igid ti baybay ti subkontinente, getta ti niog ti gagangay a masansan a mausar."" This translates to: ""In major regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in stews and curries; in South India and some regions along the coast of the subcontinent, coconut is commonly used."" Therefore, yogurt is specifically mentioned as being used in curries in North India and Pakistan.
"
Apay a kasapulan ti swerve iti lawlaw ti Transantarctic Mountains tapno makapan iti plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti naisingsingayan a traktor ket saan a nataragsit (The specialized tractor is not agile)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mabalin laeng a maturong iti naisangsangayan a traktora...saan unay a napartak."" (Only a specialized tractor can travel it...it is not very agile).
* **The passage also states:** ""masapul ti atiddog a panagsikko ti dalan a manglawlaw kadagiti Kabambantayan a Transantarctic tapno makadanon iti plateau."" (a strong road-clearing operation is needed to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau). This implies the tractor isn't capable of navigating the mountain terrain on its own.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti McMurdo Station ket masansan a nakaserra (McMurdo Station is often closed):** While weather can affect travel, the passage focuses on the terrain difficulty, not the station's accessibility.
* **B: Ti compacted a niebe ket delikado (The compacted snow is dangerous):** The passage mentions compacted snow, but the primary difficulty seems to be the terrain itself, which the tractor can't handle.
* **D: Nalaklaka daytoy ngem ti panagbiahe iti Ross Sea (It's windy but traveling in the Ross Sea):** The passage is about traversing the Transantarctic Mountains, not traveling in the Ross Sea.  While the Ross Sea can be windy, this option is irrelevant.



"
"Iti South Pole Traverse, ania ti namarkaan kadagiti bandera?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti crevass a napno iti niebe (Snow-filled crevasses)**.

The passage states: ""...the route is marked with flags..."". It further describes that the flags mark crevasses filled with snow. Options A, B, and D are not mentioned as being marked with flags in the passage.
"
Ania ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas maysa a banag a kasapulan nga annadan dagiti turista no mapanda iti Southern Africa?,"The correct answer is **C: Dandani amin dagiti pagilian a karruba ti Southern Africa ket natalged** (Don't assume all the countries in Southern Africa are accessible).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Dagiti kaarrubana a pagilian ket saan. (The urban countries are not.)"" This directly contradicts option C.  The entire point of the passage is that some areas are *not* easily accessible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti agduduma a nasion ket addaan kadagiti agduduma a kasapulan para kadagiti Visa (Different nations have different visa requirements):** The passage mentions visa requirements, stating they vary based on nationality and the country you are coming from.  So, this *is* mentioned in the text.
* **B: Ti panagsukisok babaen ti lugan ket nasayaat a pamay-an tapno agpasiar kadagiti lugar iti ruar ti nadadael a dalan (Traveling by overland is a good way to explore places outside of the paved roads):** The passage states that overland travel is *necessary* to access many areas. This is implicitly mentioned as a key part of the travel method.
* **D: Ti 4x4 ket maikalikagum no agbiahe ka babaen ti lugan (A 4x4 is useful if you travel overland):** The passage emphasizes the need for a 4x4 to navigate the less accessible roads, so this *is* mentioned.



Therefore, only option C directly contradicts information presented in the text.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti maikonsiderar a madi a balakad para kadagiti turista a mangsukisok ti Southern Africa babaen ti lugan?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti banbanag a partikular para ti emerhensia iti uneg ti lugan ket kasapulan ti kalintegan** (Emergency preparedness within the region requires vigilance).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kada pagilan ket adda ti sabsabali a turay a mangibaga no ania dagiti pang-emerhensia a bambanag iti uneg ti lugan."" (Each country has different governments that provide information on emergency preparedness within the region.) This highlights the importance of being prepared for emergencies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uray no maikalikagum ti 4x4, adu kadagiti lugar ket maakses babaen kadagiti normal a lugan** (Even with a 4x4, many places are accessible via normal roads) - The passage directly contradicts this, stating that some areas *require* a robust 4x4.
* **C: Ti panagbiahe babaen ti lugan ket nasayaat para kadagiti agsapsapul a sumiasi dagiti normal a ruta** (Traveling by road is suitable for those who want to follow normal routes) - The passage says this is *not* the case, as the road trip is for those seeking off-the-beaten-path experiences.
* **D: Saan amin a pagilian a karruba iti Southern Africa ket mayat a bisitaen** (Not all countries in Southern Africa are good places to visit) - While the passage *implies* that some countries might be more challenging, it doesn't explicitly state that *all* are bad destinations.  The focus is on the road trip being for adventurous travelers, not on the inherent quality of each country as a tourist destination.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas mabalin a delikado iti panangibati kadagiti bagmo nga awan ti agbantay?,"The correct answer is **B: Mabalin nga agbalin ka a carrier ti droga a saanmo nga ammo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...mabalin a dimo mapupuotan a maus-usarka gayamen nga agipuspuslit iti droga, a mangyeg kenka iti dakkel a problema."" This directly implies the risk of becoming a carrier.
* **The other options are less directly supported:**
    * **A: Mabalinda a matakaw:** While possible, the passage focuses more on the dangers of *using* drugs, not just being present around them.
    * **C: Mabalinda a matikaw no kaniada daytoy:**  The passage doesn't emphasize theft as a primary concern.
    * **D: Dagiti autoridad ket makunada a mabalin a bomb threat daytoy:** This is not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the risk of unknowingly becoming a carrier of drugs is the most prominent and directly supported danger mentioned in the passage."
Ania ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa maipapan ti panagitugot ti droga?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti sumagmamano a pagilian, dagiti damo a nangaramid kadaytoy ket mabalin a masentensiaan ti pannakatay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions** that some countries have ""draconian punishments, even for first offenses,"" including sentences of up to 10 years in prison or even the death penalty.
* **Option A directly reflects this information.**
* **Option B** discusses general precautions when traveling, which is mentioned but not a specific detail *about* drug use.
* **Option C** is incorrect. The passage states that drug-sniffing dogs *can* be used at any time.
* **Option D** is not mentioned in the passage. It doesn't say authorities can confiscate luggage without a warrant.



"
Ania a tipo ti mainum ti saan a naibaga kas maysa a banag a mabalin a padasem nga aramiden iti pagtaengan bayat ti staycation?,"The correct answer is **C: Serbesa (Beer)**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions several drink options for a staycation:

*   ""naimas a kape"" (strong coffee)
*   ""makapabang-ar a tsaa a chamomile"" (high-quality chamomile tea)
*   ""...maysa a simple nga inumen a mabalinmo nga aramiden para iti pammigat no nagsublikan iti inaldaw a panagubram."" (...a simple drink you can make for relaxation after a long day.)
*   ""...mapan iti bar ken pub iti kaarrubaan a madim masansan nga aramiden."" (...going to a bar and pub in the neighborhood, which is not often done.)

While the passage mentions coffee and tea, it implies a desire for something a bit more relaxing and perhaps celebratory. ""Serbesa"" (beer) fits this description as a drink often enjoyed during relaxation and social activities like visiting a bar.

The other options are less likely:

*   **Juice:** While a simple drink, it's not specifically suggested in the passage.
*   **Kape (Coffee):** Mentioned, but not the focus of the passage's suggestion for a relaxing drink.
*   **Tsaa (Tea):** Mentioned, but not the focus of the passage's suggestion for a relaxing drink.

Therefore, beer is the best fit for a drink that could be easily made or enjoyed during a staycation, aligning with the passage's overall message."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kasapulam a bisitaen bayat ti staycation no ti siudadmo ket popular iti kultura ti panaginum?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti pub a saanmo unay a pappanan (Pubs you haven't been to before)**.

Here's why:

The passage suggests that stayingcation is a good time to explore local culture, specifically regarding drinks. It mentions that in cities with diverse cultures, visiting pubs and bars is a great way to experience this. Option C directly aligns with this suggestion.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Dagiti coffee shop iti ruar ti sangakaarrubaam (Coffee shops outside your neighborhood):** While a possibility, the passage focuses more on evening relaxation and cultural exploration, which pubs often embody more than coffee shops.
* **B: Dagiti tiendaan ti juice wenno smoothie (Juice or smoothie shops):** This is presented as an alternative to a ""simple drink"" for a busy day, not a cultural exploration activity during a staycation.
* **D: Dagiti panganan a mangserserbi ti chamomile a tsaa (Restaurants that serve chamomile tea):**  The passage mentions chamomile tea as a relaxing evening drink, but it doesn't suggest specifically visiting restaurants *for* the tea.  Pubs are a more direct reflection of the ""cultural drinks"" idea.



"
Sadinno a makita dagiti eskulta a kalapati?,"The correct answer is **B: Iti paraangan ti simbaan (In the churchyard)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Itiparaangan ti simbaan, adda dagiti makapaawis a kitikit a marmol a kalapati a naiparabaw kadagiti dadduma a tanem."" (In the churchyard, there are intricate marble doves perched on various plants.)
"
Ania a tipo ti visa ti mabalin a mangikasapulan ti maysa a tao a mangipaay ti pammaneknek ti naan-anay a suporta iti kuarta?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ti estudiante**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sa in kaaduan a nasion, kasapulam ti surat ti awis manipud iti institusion a kayatmo a pagbasaan, ken kasta met ti pammaneknek ti kaadda ti pondo a mangsuporta iti bagim uray iti laeng umuna a tawen ti kursom.""  This refers to the requirements for a student visa. The ability to demonstrate financial support is a key requirement for student visas.

While business visas (A) might require financial documentation, the text directly links financial support to student visas. Tourist visas (B) generally don't require proof of financial support, and temporary visas (C) is too broad a term to pinpoint the specific visa type described in the text.



"
Siasino ti ad-adda a mangikasapulan ti extended a visa?,"The correct answer is **C: Maysa nga internasional nga estudiante (An international student)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Iti kaaduan, ti panagtalinaed iti sabali a pagilian ti nabaybayag nga oras ket adda kalikaguman a mangala ti visa a nasapsapa. **Gagangay a dagiti visa ti estudiante ket addaan kadagiti nadumaduma a kasapulan ken kadagiti proseso ti panangala ngem kadagiti normal a visa ti turista wenno visa ti negosio.** Iti kaaduan a nasion, kasapulam ti surat ti awis manipud iti institusion a kayatmo a pagbasaan , ken kasta met ti pammaneknek ti kaadda ti pondo a mangsuporta iti bagim uray iti laeng umuna a tawen ti kursom.""

This indicates that international students need a different type of visa with specific requirements, often including a letter of acceptance from the institution and proof of funds.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maysa a regular a turista (A regular tourist):** The passage contrasts student visas with tourist visas, implying they are different.
*   **B: Maysa a seasoned nga agbi-biahe (A seasoned traveler):** Seasoned travelers may not necessarily need a different type of visa, depending on their nationality and destination.
*   **D: Maysa nga agbi-biahe gapu ti negosio (Someone traveling for business):** Business travelers also need a specific visa type, which is different from a student visa. The passage highlights the differences between student and business visas.



"
Kaano a rumbeng a nangnangruna a sipapanunotka kadagiti lamok?,"The correct answer is **C: Iti rainforest**.

The passage states: ""No kalgaw, kangrunaanna, masapul a bantayam dagiti lamok no ikeddengmo ti umuli idiay **kabakiran**."" (In the rainy season, you really need to watch out for mosquitoes if you go back to the **rainforest**.)

While mosquitoes can be found in other locations mentioned (hikes, driving), the passage specifically highlights the rainforest as the area where mosquito vigilance is most important during the rainy season.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti liklikam nga aramiden tapno makalisi kadagiti lamok bayat ti panagmaneho iti rainforest?","The correct answer is **A: Baybay-an a silulukat dagiti ridaw ti lugan iti napaut unay.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""No kalgaw, kangrunaanna, masapul a bantayam dagiti lamok no ikeddengmo ti umuli idiay kabakiran."" This translates to ""If it's humid, especially, you need to watch out for mosquitoes when returning to the rainforest."" It then goes on to explain why this is important.

The passage doesn't explicitly give advice on *how* to avoid mosquitoes while driving. However, it strongly implies vigilance and a need to take precautions *when in* the rainforest, particularly during humid conditions.  Option A, ""Baybay-an a silulukat dagiti ridaw ti lugan iti napaut unay"" (""Spray repellent heavily on exposed skin""), is the most logical action to take to protect yourself from mosquitoes in a rainforest environment. The other options are either incorrect or irrelevant.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti Sundarbans ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **A: Ipakitana ti sumagmamano a napigsa a bakir nga adda pay laeng inggana tatta**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Dagiti bakir ket saan nga aluguog ti parakad ngem - inkadua kadagiti manmano a maudi nga agtalinaed a takder iti napigsa a kabakiran a naminsan a tininep ti patag ti Ganges."" This means the mangrove forests are not just any forests; they are rare and ancient ecosystems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kagudua ti dagup a kalawana ket tininep ti kadandanuman:** The passage says ""3,850 a kilometro kuadrado, km2, nga agarup kakatlo iti dayta ket kadandanuman a parte."" So, *part* of the area is flooded, not the *majority*.
*   **C: Daytoy ti kadadakkelan a takdang a napno ti parakad iti entero a lubong:** The passage states ""kadadakkelan ti takdang a napno ti parakad iti entero a lubong"" which is a true statement according to the passage.
*   **D: Makita dagiti ad-adu a labang nga ugsa ngem kadagiti Bengal a tigre:** The passage says ""adda itan 400 a tigre a Royal Bengal ken agarup 30,000 a labang nga ugsa iti lugar."" This means there are Bengal tigers, not that there are *more* of other animals than tigers.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* supported by the passage is that the mangrove forests are rare and ancient ecosystems, but are being lost."
Ania a paset ti bakir ti adda iti teritorio ti India?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Sundarbans National Park**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti parte iti bakir nga adda iti uneg ti teritorio ti India ket maawagan a Sundarbans National Park.""
"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti ad-adda a limitado ti pannakaawatda ti Ingles lengguahe a Ingles?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti tattao nga agasasao ti kababaan ti dua a sabali pay a lengguahe.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Adu nga entero a nasion ket nalaing nga agsao ti Ingles, ket Kanayonanna pay namnamaem a limitado laeng iti pannakaammo-kangrunaanna kadagiti agtutubo.""  This means that even though many people in these nations *know* English, their understanding is limited, particularly for those who are not native speakers.  The preceding sentences emphasize the difficulty of translating idioms and cultural nuances. Therefore, the limited understanding of English is related to having another language as a primary language.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti narigat nga iyebkas?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti adres (Addresses)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Adu nga entero a nasion ket nalaing nga agsao ti Ingles, ket Kanayonanna pay namnamaem a limitado laeng iti pannakaammo-kangrunaanna kadagiti agtutubo. Panunotem, no kayatmo, ti maysa a Mancunian, Bostonian, Jamaican ken Sydneysider nga agtutugaw iti lawlaw ti maysa a lamisaan a mangrabrabiida iti maysa a restaurant idiay Toronto. Maragragsakanda nga agin-innestoria kadagiti mapaspasamak iti nakayanakanda nga ili, nga isasaoda dagita iti bukodda nga ayug ken bengngat.""

This sentence describes people from different places having trouble understanding each other's *accents* and *local slang*, but the passage says **""Adu nga entero a nasion ket nalaing nga agsao ti Ingles, ket Kanayonanna pay namnamaem a limitado laeng iti pannakaammo-kangrunaanna kadagiti agtutubo.""** This refers to the fact that even though many nations speak English, the understanding is limited to the youth. 

Then, it's mentioned that even people from diverse backgrounds could have issues understanding each other, but the passage mentions that **""Adu nga inteiro a nasion ket nalaing nga agsao ti Ingles, ket Kanayonanna pay namnamaem a limitado laeng iti pannakaammo-kangrunaanna kadagiti agtutubo.""**. This is not related to understanding accents.

However, the passage also says ""Adu nga inteiro a nasion ket nalaing nga agsao ti Ingles, ket Kanayonanna pay namnamaem a limitado laeng iti pannakaammo-kangrunaanna kadagiti agtutubo."" This means that even though they speak English, their accents can be hard to understand. The accents are not the only reason that people have trouble understanding each other.

Finally, the passage mentions the difficulty in understanding each other's *accents* and *local slang*. 

The problem is that there is no reference to difficulty with *addresses* anywhere in the text. 

The passage mentions difficulty understanding each other’s local slang. It says: “Adu nga inteiro a nasion ket nalaing nga agsao ti Ingles, ket Kanayonanna pay namnamaem a limitado laeng iti pannakaammo-kangrunaanna kadagiti agtutubo. Panunotem, no kayatmo, ti maysa a Mancunian, Bostonian, Jamaican ken Sydneysider nga agtutugaw iti lawlaw ti maysa a lamisaan a mangrabrabiida iti maysa a restaurant idiay Toronto. Maragragsakanda nga agin-innestoria kadagiti mapaspasamak iti nakayanakanda nga ili, nga isasaoda dagita iti bukodda nga ayug ken bengngat.”

The correct answer is difficulty understanding each other's accents and slang, or the difficulties mentioned in the passage. 

However, there is no reference to difficulty with *addresses* anywhere in the text.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{accents}$"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a kasasaad ti kasayaatan para ti agbi-biahe nga agplan-plano a mangusar ti bus manipud ti inter-distrito nga istasion?","The correct answer is **A: Ti agbi-biahe a mapan iti Jakar ken addaanen ti nagatang a tiket iti naisakbay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gapu ta masansan a mapno dagiti agbiahe dagiti bus ditoy distrito, maisingasing ti pananggatang iti tiket a nasapsapa iti sumagmamano nga aldaw."" (Due to the scarcity of buses in the district, bus tickets are often sold out several days in advance.)
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Kaaduan, kangrunaan dagiti mapan daya ken Jakar/Bumthang pumanawda iti baetan iti 06:30 ken 07:30."" (Mostly, buses going to the north and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.)

Therefore, to travel to Jakar, you need to plan ahead and secure a ticket in advance because they sell out quickly. Option A accurately reflects this crucial information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti agbi-biahe ket mapan iti Bumthang ken kasapulan a pumanaw iti 7** - While buses to Bumthang depart early, the passage doesn't specifically mention a 7:00 departure time.
* **C: Ti agbi-biahe ket mapan iti Paro ken kasapulan a pumanaw kalpasan ti 11** - The passage doesn't mention buses to Paro or a departure time after 11:00.
* **D: Ti agbi-biahe ket mapan iti daya ken sumangpet iti istasion sakbay ti 6:20** -  The passage doesn't specifically mention buses going *north* (daya) departing by 6:20. It mainly focuses on Jakar and Bumthang.



"
Ania ti nasayaat a singasing para iti turista a mangsapsapul nga agbiahe nga agpadaya manipud iti inter-district bus station?,"The correct answer is **B: Gumatang ti advance a tiket (Book tickets in advance)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that fuel shortages have led to ticket sales being suspended for several days. This implies that buses aren't running reliably and are likely to resume service at unpredictable times.
* Option B directly addresses this problem by suggesting booking tickets in advance. This allows tourists to secure a spot on a bus *if* and *when* service resumes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti bus ket pumanaw laeng kalpasan ti 8:30 (Buses only depart after 8:30):** The passage says the majority of buses to the north and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30. This contradicts option A.
* **C: Adu a bus ti pumanpanaw iti intero nga aldaw (Many buses depart throughout the day):**  The fuel shortages have disrupted the bus schedule, so this is unlikely to be true.
* **D: Mabalin a ti shared taxi ti kasisiriban a pamay-an ti panagbiahe (Shared taxis can be a convenient mode of transport):** While the passage *mentions* shared taxis as an option, it doesn't highlight them as a *solution* to the current problem of disrupted bus service. Booking tickets in advance is a more direct response to the fuel shortage issue.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a pannakailadawan ti Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ad-adu ti Arabic nga implwensiana ngem ti intero a pagilian**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""The city is unlike other cities in the country, because it has a large Arab influence rather than African.""  This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Napanglaw daytoy:** The passage mentions Timbuktu was ""once a gloomy town,"" but it also states that its reputation is now ""becoming known to tourists,"" implying it's no longer gloomy.
* **C: Saan a maakses ti eroplano:** The passage specifically says ""even has an airport.""
* **D: Agtalinaed dayta a pakaawisan dagiti usiuso a turista:**  While the passage mentions its reputation is becoming known to tourists, it doesn't state it's currently ""overrun"" with tourists.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a pudno a banag maipapan ti Timbuktu ti agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **B: Ad-adda nga eksotiko ngem napanglaw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Idi agdama, napanglaw nga ili ti Timbuktu, uray no ti reputasionna ket pakaawisan dagiti turista..."" This directly supports the ""napanglaw"" part of option B.
* **The passage also states:** ""...ti “Timbuktu” ket nagbalin a mausar a kas metapora para iti eksotiko, adayo a daga."" This supports the ""eksotiko"" part of option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maakses ti siudad babaen ti eroplano:** While the passage mentions an airport, it's not the defining characteristic used to describe Timbuktu's reputation.
* **C: Basbassit ti African a saguday ngem ti aglawlaw a siudad na:** The passage says the city has a *significant* Arab influence, not a small African one. It also explicitly calls it ""napanglaw"" (gloomy/desolate).
* **D: Ti siudad ket saanen a makaawis kadagiti turista:** The passage states that Timbuktu's reputation was *affected* by its past.

Therefore, option B is the only one accurately reflecting the information provided in the passage.
"
Kaano nga orihinal a naiyiskediul ti Summer Olympics? ,"The correct answer is **B: Marso 2020**.

The text states: ""No nagpareserba dagiti biahem ken pagdagusan para iti 2020 sakbay a naiwaragawag ti pannakapasardengna..."" which means reservations were made for the 2020 Olympics.  The text also says the Olympics were rescheduled to July 2020, but then postponed again to August 2021. Therefore, the original schedule was in **March 2020**.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania punto nga agbalin nga ipu-ipo ti imbudo?","The correct answer is **C: Bayat ti panagbaba manipud kadagiti ulep ti bagyo**.

The passage states: ""Mangrugida a kas imbudo a bumabbaba aggapu iti ulep ti bagyo, ken agbalin nga “ipu-ipo” no dumikketda iti daga."" (It starts like a funnel descending from storm clouds, and becomes a ""whirlwind"" when it reaches the ground.)

While option A mentions wind speed, the passage doesn't specify a *precise* wind speed for the transition. Option B describes the initial funnel shape. Option D is incorrect as the transition happens *while* descending from the storm clouds, not after hitting the ground.
"
Ania kadagitoy ti umiso a pakabigbigan ti ipu-ipo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kanayonda a mangaramid ti angin iti nasurok 100-200 a milya kada oras**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Makagun-odda ti napigsa nga angin (masansan a 100-200 milia kada oras)..."" (It can produce strong winds (usually 100-200 miles per hour)...)

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **B: Masansan nga aggar-garawda kadua dagiti nadagsen a banag** (Often accompanied by heavy rain): While often true, the passage doesn't highlight heavy rain as a defining characteristic.
* **C: Agbalinda nga imbudo kalpasan ti panagsagid ti daga** (Becomes funnel-shaped after touching the ground): This describes a tornado, not the general phenomenon of a waterspout.
* **D: Agtaltallikusda a teddek a mangiduron iti angin agparuar** (Rotating column of wind emerging): This is a good *description* of a waterspout, but option A focuses on the wind speed, which is a key feature of waterspouts.



Therefore, the most accurate and directly supported answer from the passage is **A**."
"Segun iti mabasa, manipud sadinno a kasapulan a makagun-od ti balakad ti agbibiahe maipapan ti kasasaad ti pulitika ti siudad ti destinasionda?","The correct answer is **B: Manipud kadagiti makuna a naipresentar iti uneg ti balakad ti panagbiahe.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Mabalinmo met a konsultaen ti pammagbaga dagiti gobierno a saan laeng a ti bukbukodmo, ngem ket nairanta pammagbagada a para kadagiti umilida."" This indicates that information about political situations should be sought from travel advisories.
* The passage further explains that travel advisories are often brief and simplified compared to detailed societal information.
* Therefore, the information you need to read about the political climate of your destination is *within* the travel advisory itself.



The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Manipud ti gobierno ti pagilian a bisitaenda** - While the destination country's government *produces* the advisories, the passage implies the information is *found* within the advisory document itself.
* **C: Manipud kadagiti umili ti pagilian a bisitaenda** - The passage doesn't suggest seeking information from locals.
* **D: Manipud ti bukodda a gobierno** - This is not mentioned in the passage."
"No adda padamag ti panagbiahe, ania ti saan a nalabit a mapasaran ti ganggannaet nga umili?","The correct answer is **B: Napasimple unay dagiti sumario maipapan ti kasasaad ti pulitika ti pagilian**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dagiti kapanunotan a naipresenta ditoy ket masansan a parparawpaw, nalawa ken napasimple la unay kumpara kadagiti nadetdetalye nga impormasion a masarakan iti dadduma."" This directly addresses the simplification of political situations in the summaries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naapektaran ti pannakakansela ti insurance:** The passage mentions that travel insurance or trip cancellation insurance *can* be affected, but it doesn't say this is the *most* notable impact.
* **C: Naapektaran ti insurance ti salun-at:** Similar to A, travel insurance being affected is mentioned, but not highlighted as the most prominent consequence.
* **D: Detalyado nga impormasion maipapan ti kasasaad ti pulitika ti pagilian:** The passage says the summaries are *not* detailed, making this option incorrect.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti biahe ti saan unay a mangikasapulan ti baddang iti panag-book manipud ti ahente ti panagbiahe?","The correct answer is **B: Maysa a dua a lawas a biahe iti partikular unay a badyet**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents were originally popular for travelers with limited exposure to different cultures, languages, or nations. It also mentions that agents are good for booking complex itineraries, budget travel, or specific needs. 

Option B, ""Maysa a dua a lawas a biahe iti partikular unay a badyet"" (A two-week trip with a specific, limited budget) falls directly into the category of needing an agent's expertise to manage the details and potentially find deals. 

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Panagbiahe iti komperensia ti trabaho iti siudad a sinarungkaran ti biahero idi** (Business trip to a city where the traveler is already familiar): This type of trip is likely straightforward to book and doesn't require the specialized knowledge of a travel agent.
*   **C: Maysa a panagbiahe a mangiparang iti lapped iti pagsasao** (A trip that involves a lot of language differences): While an agent *can* help, it's not necessarily the *least* likely. Specialized agencies often handle trips involving significant language barriers.
*   **D: Ti umuna a biahe ti biahero iti sabali a pagilian** (The traveler's first trip to another country): This *is* a good reason to use a travel agent, as they can provide support and guidance to a first-time international traveler.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, iti ania a kasasaad a makabenepisio unay iti agbi-biahe manipud ti tulong ti ahente ti panagbiahe?","The correct answer is **B: No interesado ti agbi-biahe ti panag-book ti excursion ti espesialidad iti umuna a daras.**

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are particularly helpful for travelers interested in destinations related to:

*   **Aglawlaw (tradition)**
*   **Kultura (culture)**
*   **Panagsarsarita (language)**
*   **Nasion nga adda nababa a kita (nations with lower incomes)**

Option B aligns with these points. Booking a special excursion is often a way to immerse oneself in the local culture, traditions, or unique aspects of a destination.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: No ti agbi-biahe ket nag-book kadagiti roundtrip a flight tapno bisitaen ti pagtataenganda a pagilian (If the traveler books roundtrip flights to visit their home country):** This isn't necessarily a situation where a travel agent is *especially* beneficial. Roundtrip flights are fairly standard, and it's less about specialized travel.
*   **C: No ti agbi-biahe ket nalaing iti native a lengguahe ti destinasion ti bakasion (If the traveler is fluent in the native language of their vacation destination):** Being fluent in the language reduces the need for a travel agent.
*   **D: No ti agbi-biahe ket bumis-bisita iti lugar a naruam isunan kadagiti kultural a panagdudumada (If the traveler visits a place that is rich in cultural traditions):** While a travel agent *can* be helpful, option B is more specific and highlights a more active way to engage with those traditions (through excursions).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti makatulong iti agbibiahe a maliklikan ti saan a kinanapnek bayat ti panagbisita kadagiti baro a lugar?","The correct answer is **A: Panangnamnama kadagiti agpapada a kadawyan ti naggapuanda.**

Here's why:

The passage states that when traveling, things will be different from home - customs, language, food, traffic, etc.  To be comfortable, you need to *think* about (panangnamnama) the customs of the place you're visiting. This directly aligns with option A, which emphasizes understanding and anticipating the local customs.

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   **B:** While knowing about food is helpful, the passage focuses on broader cultural awareness, not specific dietary restrictions.
*   **C:**  Focusing on similarities to your own culture isn't the key to understanding new customs.
*   **D:**  While understanding traffic is helpful, it's only one small aspect of adapting to a new environment. The passage emphasizes more general cultural awareness.



"
"Base ti impormasion iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti tao ti mabalin a makapadas ti saan a kinanapnek no agbiahe iti sabali a lugar?","The correct answer is **C: Maysa a tao a naserraan ti panunotna (Someone who is open-minded)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of being mindful and adaptable when traveling. It states that things will be different from home – customs, food, traffic, etc.  Being **open-minded** (naserraan ti panunotna) is the key trait needed to navigate these differences and have a positive travel experience.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Maysa a tao a kaykayatna dagiti eksotiko a makan (Someone who loves exotic food):**  While enjoying new food is great, it's not the core of adapting to a new culture.
* **B: Maysa a tao nga ipangpangrunana ti panagbaliw (Someone who prioritizes change):**  Prioritizing change doesn't necessarily equate to being adaptable and respectful of local customs.
* **D: Maysa a tao a mangipapas ti panagadal ti baro a banbanag (Someone who is eager to learn new things):** Learning is helpful, but it's the *openness* to different ways of doing things that's most crucial.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikalikagum a balakad para kadagiti agbi-biahe no damo kayo a bumis-bisita ti rumangrang-ay pay laeng a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **D: Mapan iti dekalidad a hotel no damo ka a sumangpet.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of staying in Western-style hotels with good quality for travelers to remote or new countries.** It highlights the benefit of familiar amenities (bed, food, services) when unfamiliar with the local environment.
* **Option D directly aligns with this advice.**  ""Mapan iti dekalidad a hotel"" (Bring a quality hotel) is a direct paraphrase of the passage's suggestion to prioritize good hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ammuen ti lokal a fauna sakbay a maturog iti daga (Know the local fauna before sleeping on the ground):** The passage *discourages* sleeping on the ground due to potential dangers from local fauna.
* **B: Liklikan ti panaggasto iti makan bayat ti sumagmamano nga umuna nga aldaw mo (Reduce spending on food for the first few days):**  The passage suggests prioritizing familiar food options (like hotels) especially at the beginning of a trip.
* **C: Ti indayon ket maikalikagum no agkampo iti ruar (Camping is suitable if camping outdoors):** While camping can be okay, the passage recommends using tents or shelters to avoid animals, scorpions, and other dangers, suggesting camping might not always be the best option.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nadakamat kas banag a paggastuan tapno maruamka iti rumangrang-ay pay laeng a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti dekalidad a hotel**. 

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that to feel safe in remote or new countries, it's important to stay in hotels with a Western style, quality food, and services. Option D directly reflects this point.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Western nga istilo a makan:** While mentioned, the passage focuses more on the overall quality and safety provided by the hotel environment, not just the style of food.
*   **B: Dagiti dekalidad a serbisio:** Similar to A, quality services are part of the hotel experience but not the primary focus of the safety advice.
*   **C: Ti matres wenno ap-ap para ti panagkampo:** This relates to camping safety, not staying in hotels.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer because it aligns directly with the core advice given in the passage about ensuring a safe and comfortable stay in remote locations."
"Ania kadagiti sumaganad a pagpilian ti kasayaatan para ti para-iggem ti polisia a kayat a mangaramid ti virtual a kopia ti polisiada, ngem awanan ti akses iti internet?","The correct answer is **C: Panagidulin ti kopia a naidulin iti memoria ti laptopda.**

Here's why:

* **The question specifically states the user has no internet access.**
* **Option C** directly addresses this by suggesting storing the copy on a laptop or tablet's memory.
* **Options A and B** require internet access for sharing.
* **Option D** also requires internet access to upload to the cloud.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a kasapulan a maipakita iti polisia?","The correct answer is **D: Ti email address ti para-iggem ti polisia**.

Here's why:

The text states that the email address is needed for the insurer for ""balakad/panag-autorisa"" (authorization) and ""no mangaramid ti panagdawat"" (when making a claim). It also explicitly says to provide the email address to the insurer. 

However, the question asks what is *not* required. The text *does* say to provide the international phone number for claims and authorization. It *does* say to provide the email address for communication with the insurer.  Therefore, the only option that is explicitly stated as **not** required is the email address of the policyholder.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti negatibo a kadakkel ti manganninaw ti pormat ti film a kadawyan unay a maus-usar?","The correct answer is **C: 35 mm a negatibo**.

The text states: ""Ti kaaduanna a naus-usar ket ti gagangay a film a 35mm (36 by 24 mm a negative)."" This directly indicates that the 35mm negative is the most commonly used format. While 6x6cm and 56x56mm formats are mentioned, the text highlights 35mm as the most popular.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a pormat ti film ti maipada ti resolusion a kas iti DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: 35 mm film**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""Alisto laeng a suktan daytoy no maibusanka, ken mangted ti resolusion a mabalin maipada iti agdama a DSLR.""  This translates to ""Only estimate this if you can, and relate its resolution to that of an older DSLR.""  The initial statement specifies that the most common film format is 35mm, and it is being compared to DSLR resolution.

The other options are either:

* **B: Dagiti dadduma a kalalainganna ti pormana a film:** (Other formats of film) - This is too broad.
* **C: 56 x 56 mm film** and **D: 6 x 6 cm film:** These are larger format films, and the question explicitly states that the estimated resolution is meant to be comparable to an *older* DSLR, not a high-end one.  Larger formats generally have higher resolution, so they wouldn't be the best comparison for an older DSLR.



Therefore, based on the direct statement in the question, 35mm film is the most accurate answer.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti mabalin a maudi nga addang iti panagrugi iti negosio ti panagsurat maipapan iti panagbiahe?","The correct answer is **C: Mangaramid ti bukodmo a website**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kalpasan a mairuammon ti panag-format ken panag-edit iti web, inton kuan, mabalinmon ti agaramid iti bukodmo a website."" (After understanding web formatting and editing, then you can create your own website.) This implies creating your own website is the *final* step mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sanayen ti panag-format iti web:** This is an early step, mentioned *before* creating a website.
* **B: Agsurat kadagiti adu nga artikulo para ti mayat ti reputasionna a blog ti panagbiahe:** This is an ongoing activity *after* having a website.  It's important, but not the final step in *starting* a business.
* **D: Pasayaatem ti paglaingam nga ag-edit:**  This is also a necessary skill, but it's a step *before* creating a website.



"
"No mangrugi iti negosio ti panagsurat maipapan iti panagbiahe, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga abilidad ti masapul a nalabit a pasayaaten nga umuna?","The correct answer is **A: Panag-blog**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes starting with a blog.** It explicitly states, ""Ti kalpasan a mairuammon ti panag-format ken panag-edit iti web, inton kuan, mabalinmon ti agaramid iti bukodmo a website.""  This implies that blogging is the foundational step.
* **B, C, and D are all skills that build *upon* blogging.** You need to be able to create content (blog posts) *before* you can format it, edit it, or build a website around it.

Therefore, the most essential skill to develop *first* for starting a travel writing business is **panag-blog (blogging)**.
"
Iti ania a tipo ti klima ti kadawyan a pakakitaan dagiti problema iti bagis?,"The correct answer is **A: Nalammiis a klima**.

The text explicitly states: ""Isu a dagiti saplit iti Delhi Belly, ti Lunod ni Parao, Panangibales ni Montezuma, ken ti adu a gagayyemda. Maipapan kadagiti sakit iti panaganges no madama ti nalamiis a klima..."" which directly links these illnesses to **hot climates**.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti kanayon a pannakaisarang ket mabalin a makaigapu ti imyunidad iti ania?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti lokal a mikrobio**.

The text states: ""Iti balayda, gapu iti kanayon a panakaisarang ti lokal a mikrobio, nangato ti tiansa nga immunekan.""  This translates to: ""At home, due to constant exposure to local microbes, the chance of immune strength increases."" Therefore, constant exposure to local microbes is what increases the chance of immunity.
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti bentahe iti panagbiahe iti uneg ti lugar ti Schengen?,"The correct answer is **A: Maliklikan ti adu a panagaplikar ti visa**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Kapadana, ti kaadda ti Schengen visam, saanmo a kasapulanen ti mangala kadagiti visa iti sabsabali a pagilian a miembro ti Schengen..."" (Therefore, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for visas to other member countries of Schengen...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pakaurnongan ti kuarta:** While a Schengen visa *can* save you money on visa application fees, the primary benefit highlighted is the reduction in the number of visas you need.
* **C: Maliklikan ti adu a checkpoint ti panagkontrol ti passport:** The Schengen area aims to *reduce* passport checks, not eliminate them. While they might be less frequent, they still exist.
* **D: Awan ti kasapulan iti passport:**  You *do* need a passport to travel in the Schengen area, regardless of whether you have a Schengen visa.



"
Ania ti saanen a mabirukan iti tanem ni Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti kinabaknang (Wealth)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dagiti adu a kinabaknang iti ayan ti tanem ket awanen..."". This means the tomb, specifically the sarcophagus, wasn't filled with the usual riches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sumagmamano a dekorasion (Some decorations):** The passage says the tomb is relatively plain (""basbassit ken awan unay ti dekorasionna daytoy""). So, *some* decoration *is* present, just not as much as other tombs.
* **B: Ulo ti mummy (Head of the mummy):** The passage mentions the head and chest are visible.
* **C: Dagiti abaga ti mummy (Chest of the mummy):** The passage mentions the head and chest are visible.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania a destination iti Vancouver ti saan unay a makaguyuguy kadagiti agbi-biahe nga sipapanunot ti presio? ","The correct answer is **C: Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Daytoy umiso a barrio a masarakan idiay Howie Sound labes laeng iti Vancouver, ken nalaka isuna a papanan bayat ti adda iskediulna a taksi ti danum a pumanaw iti Grandville Island idiay downtown ti Vancouver.""  This implies Bowen Island is easily accessible and likely less expensive than Whistler, which is highlighted as requiring a good road trip (Sea to Sky) and is a popular destination. Granville Island is presented as a place for activities and food. Therefore, Bowen Island is the least associated with a trip that focuses on cost.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a destinasion ti nalabit a mangidiaya kadagiti agbi-biahe ti autentiko a kapadasan iti Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen Island**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti Isla ti Bowen ket maysa a mapadpadayawan a pagpasiaran wenno ekskursion a mabalin nga agkayak, umuli ti bantay, paggatangan, panganan ken adu pay. Daytoy umiso a barrio a masarakan idiay Howie Sound labes laeng iti Vancouver...""

While Whistler and Granville Island are mentioned, Bowen Island is specifically highlighted as a destination for an authentic experience.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a rumbeng a sumarungkar dagiti agbibiahe iti Falls no agsapsapulda kadagiti di malapdan a buya?","The correct answer is **C: No ti kaadu ti danum ket nangato**.

The passage states: ""No panagtutudo (Nobiembre agingga Marso), ti kadakkel ti danum ket nangatngato ken ti Busay ket napigpigsa."" This directly links the period of high water levels (and thus, the falls being spectacular) to the time frame of November to March. 

While options A and B are related to the time of year, they are not as specific as option C which directly connects the high water levels to the period of November to March. Option D is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti bentahe ti panagbisita ti Victoria Falls iti nagbaetan ti Nobiembre ken Marso?","The correct answer is **C: Dramatiko a paset ti Falls**.

The text states: ""No panagtutudo (Nobiembre agingga Marso), ti kadakkel ti danum ket nangatngato ken ti Busay ket napigpigsa."" This translates to: ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water volume increases and the Falls are spectacular.""

Therefore, the benefit of visiting during November to March is to see the most impressive, ""spectacular"" display of the Falls. Options A and B are incorrect based on the text, and Option D is not mentioned as a benefit.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikalukagum no agus-usar ti drone tapno ag-film?","The correct answer is **B: Panaggun-od ti kanayonan a panaglisensia (Obtaining necessary permits)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: *""Kung agusarka ti drone, kitaem nga umuna no ania ti maipalubos nga alaam iti video ken no ania dagiti permiso wenno nayonna a lisensia a kasapulan.""*  This directly addresses the need to obtain permits.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panangkita iti naisakbay no mapalubusan ka nga ag-film (Being aware of surroundings while filming):** While important for safety, the passage doesn't highlight this as something illegal. It's more about responsible operation.
* **C: Panagsukisok kadagiti pammalubos (Searching for restricted areas):**  The passage mentions avoiding flying near airports and crowds, but doesn't specifically say searching for restricted areas is illegal.
* **D: Panag-film laeng kadagiti adu taona a lugar a saan unay a maamiris ti drone (Filming only in crowded places where the drone isn't easily visible):** This is not addressed in the passage. The passage advises *against* flying near crowds.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno dagiti kasayaatan a lugar a maka-video babaen ti drone?","The correct answer is **A: Asideg kadagiti adu a tao a saan a makakita ti kaadda ti drone.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of respecting privacy and regulations when using a drone. It specifically mentions avoiding areas with many people and obtaining necessary permits. Option A directly reflects this by suggesting locations where a drone can be used without being easily noticed by others.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kadagiti lugar a maiparit ti regular photography:** While photography and videography share similarities, the passage highlights the unique considerations for drone use (permits, airspace restrictions). This option doesn't address those.
* **C: Kadagiti okupado a lugar a saan unay a makita ti drone:**  This is a contradiction. The passage cautions against using drones in crowded areas.
* **D: Kadagiti lugar a nakagun-odan dagiti naisakbay a permiso:**  While permits are necessary, the passage doesn't imply that the *best* locations are those with already obtained permits. It implies obtaining permits *before* flying in a specific location.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Iti dadduma a kasasaad, dagiti agtalinaed laeng iti ruar ti pagdagusan ti turista ti kasapulan nga agpalista."" (In other cases, those staying only in tourist accommodations need to register.) This means it's *possible* you don't need to register.
* Option B is incorrect because the text says not all countries require registration.
* Option C is correct, but the question asks for something *not* clearly stated. While registration at immigration offices is mentioned, the text doesn't guarantee it's *always* required.
* Option D is correct, but the question asks for something *not* clearly stated. While hotels often charge for registration, the text doesn't guarantee it's *always* required.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti lugar a saan a papanan ti turista tapno magawayan ti panagrehistroda?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti hotel a pagnanaedanda (The hotel where you are staying)**.

The text states: ""Iti kaaduan a nasion nga adda kastoy a linteg, dagiti lokal a hotel ti mangestimar iti panagrehistro (siguraduem a damagen)."" This translates to: ""In most nations with this regulation, local hotels estimate the registration (usually for a fee).""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maysa a lokal nga istasion ti pulis (A local police station):** The text mentions police but not as the primary place for registration.
* **C: Ti lokal a post office (The local post office):** The text doesn't mention post offices.
* **D: Dagiti opisina ti imigrasion (Immigration offices):** While immigration offices *might* be involved in some cases, the text specifically mentions hotels as the common place for registration.

Siasino ti saan a magunggonaan iti panagboluntario bayat ti panagbiahe?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa a tao nga agbirbirok ti naan-anay a sueldo (Someone who expects a regular salary)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many volunteer organizations provide room and board and even small stipends. It implies that volunteer work is often not about earning a regular salary.  Therefore, someone expecting a salary wouldn't find fulfillment in this type of volunteer experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maysa a tao a mangnamnama a mangaramid ti baro a gagayyem iti ballasiw-taaw (Someone who hopes to make new friends from around the world):** The passage says volunteering offers opportunities to meet new people.
*   **C: Maysa a tao a mangnamnama a makaadal ti baro a kabaelan (Someone who hopes to learn a new skill):** The passage mentions learning about one's own culture and gaining new perspectives, which can include learning new skills.
*   **D: Maysa a tao a mabalin nga interesado iti room and board (Someone who is interested in room and board):** The passage specifically mentions that many volunteer organizations offer room and board, making this an attractive option.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano a makagunggona ti panagboluntario bayat nga adda iti ballasiw-taaw iti maysa a biahero nga addaan iti budget?","The correct answer is **C: Maidiaya no maminsan ti room and board**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Adun nga ubra a boluntario ket mangmangted ti kwarto ken pagianan ken ti sumagmamano ket mangted pay ti bassit a sweldo."" (Many volunteer jobs offer room and board, and some even offer a small salary.)
* **The question asks:** How can someone volunteer abroad on a budget?
* **Option C aligns perfectly:** Offering room and board (or other cost savings) is a key way to make volunteering abroad more affordable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti sueldo ket nalabit a kanayon a maipapaay** (Salary is rarely consistently paid): This is directly contradicted by the passage.
* **B: Gagangay nga agturong dayta kadagiti gundaway iti trabaho** (It's good to look for jobs related to your field): While this can be beneficial, it doesn't directly address the budget issue of volunteering abroad.
* **D: Makatulong dayta tapno makagun-odka iti direksion** (It helps you find direction):  While volunteering can be a path to self-discovery, this option doesn't address the financial aspect of budgeting.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a maibilang a gagangay iti panagbiahe idiay Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Panagtalinaed ti intero a biahe iti sanikua ti Disney.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Adu a mabalin nga awan limitasionna a panagbaliwbaliw, ngem daytoy latta ti kayat a sawen ti kaaduan a tao no ibagada a “mapan idiay Disney World”."" This translates to: ""There are many unlimited variations, but that's what most people mean when they say 'going to Disney World'.""  And it further describes the core of a typical Disney World trip as ""panagtalinaed ti intero a biahe iti sanikua ti Disney"" - ""staying at a Disney resort"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagtalinaed ti maysa a lawas iti panagkita kadagiti parke:** While staying at a resort *allows* park access, the passage focuses on the *resort stay* itself as the defining characteristic.
*   **B: Panagtalinaed iti off-site a hotel:** The passage specifically contrasts this with staying *at* a Disney resort.
*   **D: Panag-bus manipud ti airport a paapan iti hotel:** This is just transportation; it's a component of the trip, not the core experience.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti Walt Disney World ti saan nga agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti tiket ti park-hopper ket mabalin a maiyakar kadagiti dadduma pay nga agbibiahe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Adu a tiket a mailaklako iti online babaen kadagiti website a para auction kas iti eBay wenno Craigslist ti nausaren ti dadduma a partena a tiktiket a multi-day a para kadagiti park-hopper."" This directly contradicts option A, which states that park-hopper tickets *cannot* be found on auction websites.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Adda ti on-site a pagtalinaedan a sidadaan:** The passage states ""Adda dagiti sidadaan a bus tapno maiyakar dagiti agbibiahe manipud ti airport paapan ti sanikua"" which implies on-site lodging is available. It doesn't explicitly state there are *on-site* lodging *options* - but the implication is there.
* **C: Adda dagiti sidadaan a bus tapno maiyakar dagiti agbibiahe manipud ti airport paapan ti sanikua:** The passage *does* state this.
* **D: Dagiti tiktiket a multi-day ket masansan a mabirukan kadagiti website para auction:** The passage states the opposite - that multi-day tickets are *often* found on auction websites.



Therefore, only option A accurately identifies something about Walt Disney World that the passage *doesn't* say is false.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a parikut ti nalabit a saan a masakup iti propesional a klase ti panagsanay wenno kadagiti naisurat?","The correct answer is **A: Ti panagbiag iti naranggas nga aglawlaw (Surviving in the wilderness)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti panangbirok iti Internet para iti “naranggas nga aglawlaw a kurso” ket mabalin a maited iti lokal a kompania. Ti maysa a kurso ket gagangay a mangisuro amin nga isyu a napagsaritaan ditoy a mas detalyado, kaaduananna ket addaan ti praktikal a kapkapadasan. Ti kurso ket gagangay a manipud iti 2-5 nga aldaw ken pakairamanan ti panangtulad iti karakter, adu ti umuna a panangtaripato ken no maminsan ket panagsanay iti panagusar ti armas. **Dagiti libro ken magasin maipanggep iti panagbiag ti kasamsamekan ket adu, ngem dagiti naisurat maipanggep iti gubgubat ket manmano.**""

This means that while there are resources on general survival, detailed, practical survival *specifically within a wilderness setting* is lacking in books and magazines, and often covered in more detail in the 2-5 day courses. The passage emphasizes the practical skills taught in the courses, implying a gap in readily available literature. Options B, C, and D are all covered explicitly in the courses mentioned.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a maad ti nalabit a masakup ti propesional a klase ti panagsanay?","The correct answer is **A: Umuna a panangtaripato (First aid)**.

The text explicitly mentions ""adu ti umuna a panangtaripato"" (many first aid sessions) as part of the course. While the course covers other aspects of survival, first aid is specifically highlighted.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasayaatan iti panangliklik ti mabalin a nakontaminado a danum?","The correct answer is **D: Kitaen no addaan kadagiti partikular a peggad ti danum.**

Here's why:

The text states that adding a filter helps to frequently purify water and is more effective against specific contaminants. It also mentions different purification times depending on the location and the specific contaminants present.  Option D directly reflects the text's emphasis on identifying and addressing specific contaminants. The other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Ipaburek ti danum iti sumagmamano a minuto:** While the text mentions running water for a minute, it doesn't highlight this as the primary benefit.
*   **B: Gumatang ti nakabote a danum:** This is related to using sealed bottles, but it's not about the *effectiveness* of boiling contaminated water.
*   **C: Ipaburek ti danum iti maysa minuto:** Similar to A, this is a specific timeframe mentioned, not the overall advantage.



Therefore, the text emphasizes the importance of identifying and dealing with specific contaminants, making option D the most accurate answer."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin nga kasla imposible uray para kadagiti nalalaing nga lumalangoy?","The correct answer is **C: Panaglangoy a kontra ti kuriente**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kaaduan kadagiti ipapatay ket mapaspasamak a kas resulta ti pannakabannog iti panaglangoy kontra iti kuryente, a dandani imposible."" (Most deaths occur as a result of struggling against the current, which is impossible.)

Therefore, even for skilled swimmers, swimming against the current is presented as an impossible task.
"
Ania ti aramidem no matiliwna ka ti kuriente?,"The correct answer is **C: Aglangoy iti sabali a direksion**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Apaman a makaruarka iti kuriente, ti panaglangoy nga agsubli ket saan a narigaten. Padasem a agyan iti lugar a saankan to matiliwen, wenno, depende iti kinalaingmo ken wenno no napansindakan, mabalin nga agurayka laengen iti pannakaisalakan.""

This translates to: ""Before encountering a current, swimming against it is not advisable. Try to move to a place where you can escape, or, depending on your ability and whether you have noticed it, you can only float.""

Option C aligns with this advice. If you encounter a current, the text suggests swimming *across* it (to a place where you can escape) rather than directly against it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Padasen a rumuar iti kuriente babaen ti panagigandat iti sabali a direksion, ken normal nga aglangoy agpasubli iti baybay** - While swimming across is part of the advice, this option is a bit wordy and doesn't capture the core idea.
* **B: Aglangoy a naparpartak a kontra ti kuriente** - The text explicitly says this is *not* advisable.
* **D: Aglangoy iti baba ti rabaw ti danom** - This is not mentioned in the text as a strategy for dealing with a current.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a lokasion ti mabalin a bisitaen a kastilyo a naparbeng para ti holiday excursion?","The correct answer is **C: Iti Rhine Valley**.

The passage specifically mentions ""panagbisita kadagiti kastilyo iti Loire Valley, iti Rhine Valley..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maysa a siudad iti Danube** - While a city is on the Danube, the passage focuses on the *castles* in the Rhine Valley.
* **B: Sumaruno iti Erie Canal** - The passage mentions boating on the Erie Canal but specifically mentions castles in the Rhine Valley.
* **D: Asideg iti aniaman a dalan ti danum iti uneg ti daga** - This is too broad and doesn't reflect the specific locations mentioned.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikalikagum a singasing para kadagiti babbai nga agbibiahe iti lugar?","The correct answer is **B: Agannad kadagiti kultural a panagduduma a mabalin a mangipakita ti nainget a panangtignay manipud kadagiti lokal a residente.**

The passage explicitly states that in some cultures, wearing a ring (even a non-traditional one) can be misinterpreted and lead to unwanted attention or even violence. Option B directly reflects this concern about cultural differences and potential misinterpretations.

Here's why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Liklikan ti panagisao maipapan ti kasasaadmo kas babai:** While being discreet is generally good advice, the passage focuses specifically on the potential dangers of drawing attention as a woman *through attire*.
*   **C: Liklikan ti panagusar kadagiti nagilap nga alahas:** The passage focuses specifically on the potential dangers of drawing attention as a woman *through rings*.
*   **D: Usaren ti kinatibker no kasapulan:** This is a general statement about self-defense, but it doesn't directly address the concern about culturally sensitive jewelry.



"
"Base ti lugar a nailadawan iti mabasa, ania ti makatulong a singasing para kadagiti babbai nga agbibiahe?","The correct answer is **B: Agisuot ti dakkel a singsing tapno maipakita ti kasasaadmo kas addaan ti asawa.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly states:** ""Mairekomenda a asinoman a babai nga agbibiahe ket ibagada nga adda asawada... Makatulong ti agisuot ti singsing (dayta maysa a saan a kasla nangina unay)."" This directly links wearing a ring to indicating marital status.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amirisen dagiti saan a kadawyan a masapul a suruten:** This is too general and not specific to the situation described.
* **C: Maawatan a dagiti panagduduma ti kultura ipasimudaagda a liklikam a pagtalinaedem ti takdermo:** While cultural awareness is good, the prompt focuses on *actively signaling* marital status for safety.  Simply being aware doesn't provide a safety measure.
* **D: No maiduron ti saan mo a kayat, agbalin a natibker iti panangliklik kadagiti lallaki:** This is a risky and potentially unsafe strategy. The prompt advises against it, stating that reliance on men is discouraged.

Therefore, wearing a visible ring to signal marital status is the most directly supported and helpful suggestion from the prompt.

"Base iti mabasa, ania a kasasaad ti mabalin a mangikasapulan ti retratista a mangusar kadagiti lente ti espesialidad?","The correct answer is **A: No mangal-alada ti ladawan aglalo dagiti babassit a pinarsua**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Panangretrato iti atap a biag ket masansan a kasapulanna ti atiddog a lente ti telephoto, nupay dagiti bambanag a kas iti pangen dagiti billit wenno maysa a bassit a pinarsua, kasapulan ti sabsabali pay a lente.""

This translates to: ""Portraiture of wildlife often requires a telephoto lens, but for close-ups like photographing small details or with a small aperture, another lens is needed.""

Therefore, the need for specialized lenses is specifically tied to capturing small details.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: No dagiti ladawan ket mausar para kadagiti komersial a pangusaran:** While commercial use *can* be a reason to photograph wildlife, the passage doesn't directly link specialized lenses to commercial purposes.
* **C: No dagiti ayup a maalaan ti ladawan ket managbabain:**  The passage mentions animals can be shy, but it doesn't state this necessitates specialized lenses.
* **D: No ti parke ket addaan kadagiti naisingsingayan nga annuroten iti potograpia ti kaayupana:** The passage mentions parks as locations, but it doesn't directly connect specialized lenses to finding interesting subjects in parks.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas mabalin a karit para kadagiti retratista dagiti atap nga ayup?,"The correct answer is **C: Panagala ti pammataudan iti tipo dagiti lente a kasapulan.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that portrait photography of wildlife often requires a telephoto lens, but also mentions the need for other lenses like macro or a short focal length. This directly relates to understanding the *type of lens needed*.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Panagbirok kadagiti partikular nga eksotiko nga ay-ayup:** While the passage mentions exotic animals are hard to find, it doesn't say that *finding* them is the key takeaway for photographers. The challenge is photographing them, not necessarily locating them.
* **B: Pannakikadua kadagiti nauyong nga ay-ayup:** The passage does mention photographing animals that might be weak, injured, or scarred, but it doesn't frame this as the primary advice for photographers.  It's more of a potential challenge.
* **D: Panagtrabaho iti mabalin a delikado a lawlaw:** While the passage mentions animals might be frail or scarred, it doesn't focus on the photographers having to deal with the *dangerous* aspects of their health.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of a key piece of information presented in the text regarding portrait photography of wildlife.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nalabit a mangigapu kadagiti basbassit a problema para ti agmanmaneho nga agbi-biahe kadagiti rabaw iti bantay?,"The correct answer is **B: Nababa ti risiris (Low visibility)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kadagiti nayelo ken naniebe a kalkalsada, nababa ti risiris ket saanka a makapagmaneho a kas no addaka iti aspalto."" (On icy and snowy roads, low visibility makes driving less safe than on asphalt.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Nabayag a trapiko (Heavy traffic):** While traffic *can* be a problem, the passage doesn't specifically mention it as a primary concern related to mountain driving in winter conditions.
* **C: Nalabes a panagagneb (Excessive snowfall):** The passage mentions snow, but the focus is more on the *consequences* of snow and ice (low visibility, slippery roads).  ""Excessive snowfall"" is a broader term.
* **D: Nalapdan a panagkita (Reduced visibility):** This is similar to option B. ""Nababa ti risiris"" is the more specific phrase used in the passage to describe the problem caused by winter conditions.



Therefore, **nababa ti risiris (low visibility)** is the most directly supported answer by the provided text."
Ania ti nalabit nga agtalinaed a saan nga agbaliw maipapan ti buis ti kita kadagiti agduduma a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **B: Pannakaurnos (Taxation)**.

Here's why:

* **Pannakaurnos (Taxation)** refers to the *system* of how taxes are levied. This is the fundamental aspect that differs between countries.  Different countries have different approaches to what is taxed, how much is taxed, and who is responsible for paying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti rates (Rates)**: Tax *rates* are specific percentages. While they *do* vary, they are a *result* of the taxation system (pannakaurnos).  The rate is determined by how the government chooses to tax.
* **C: Sadinno ti pagidatagam (Taxable income)**:  This is the amount of income subject to tax. While taxable income can be calculated differently, the fundamental concept of what's considered income (salary, investment income, etc.) is fairly consistent across countries.
* **D: Dagiti braket (Tax brackets)**: Tax brackets are ranges of income that are taxed at different rates. Like rates, brackets are a specific manifestation of the overall taxation system, not the core difference between countries.



Therefore, the overarching difference and the most stable aspect that distinguishes tax systems between countries is the **pannakaurnos (taxation) itself.**



"
"Segun iti mabasa, no agtartrabahoka iti sabali nga ili a sabali a lugar ti nakabayatam, sadino la ketdi ti pangidatagam iti buis ti kitam?","The correct answer is **C: Iti pagilian nga agdama a pagtrabahoam.**

The text states: ""Mailaksid no sikayo ket maysa a diplomatiko, ti panagtrabaho idiay sabali nga ili ket kasapulan a mangidatag ti buwis ti kita idiay pagilian a nakabatayam."" This translates to: ""If you are a diplomat, working in another city requires you to pay income tax in the country where you are stationed.""

Therefore, the income tax obligation is in the country where you are working, not necessarily the country you are stationed in or any other specific location. Option C accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kadawyan no sadinno ka ti nakabatayam:** While being stationed in a country has implications, the primary factor for tax obligation is where the work is performed.
*   **B: Iti Estados Unidos:** The text mentions the US as an example of a country with both federal and local tax systems, but it doesn't say that taxes *always* go to the US. It simply indicates that income tax systems vary.
*   **D: Sadinno a nabbabba dagiti masingir:** This is too vague and doesn't specify the location of tax obligation.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan nga agpaypayso a mangiladawan ti Pangipabuyaan ti Lubong?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti pasamak ket mabalin nga agbayag agingga ti innem a bulan**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Dagitoy a pasamak ket gagangay nga agbayag iti baet ti tallo ken innem a bulan..."" which translates to ""These events are expected to last from three to six months...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti maipabuya ket masapul a maipapan ti pakasaritaan wenno kultura ti pagilian:** While the text mentions presentations on world issues, cultures, and history, it *doesn't* state that the exhibits *must* focus on history or culture. They can cover a broader range of topics.
* **B: Dagiti maipabuya a botanikal ket kaduana dagiti artistiko ken edukasional a pabuya:** The text says International Horticultural Expositions are *special* events focused on plants, gardens, etc.  It doesn't imply that all World Expos have botanical exhibits and are equivalent to the artistic/educational ones.
* **D: Dagiti pagilian ket saan a kasapulan a makipaset:** The text implies the opposite. It discusses World Expos and Horticultural Expositions as events *held* by nations. If nations didn't participate, these events wouldn't exist.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti alagaden ti Pangipabuyaan ti Lubong wenno Eksposision ti Lubong?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti pasamak ket masapul nga agbayag ti agingga innem a bulan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagitoy a pasamak ket gagangay nga agbayag iti baet ti tallo ken innem a bulan..."" (These events are scheduled to last from three to six months...). This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti maipabuya ket masapul a maipapan ti pakasaritaan ti pagilian ken dagiti issue iti lubong:** While the passage *does* say pavilions are meant to present issues and cultures, it doesn't explicitly state that history is a *requirement* for the displays.
* **B: Ti isu met laeng a pagilian ket saan a makasangaili kadagiti pasamak iti tinawen:** The passage mentions that the event is *theoretically* possible in the summer if a nation is willing, so this statement is incorrect.
* **D: Tapno maangay ti pabuya, amin a pagilian ket masapul a makipaset:** The passage doesn't say participation is *required*. It just mentions the event is scheduled for a certain duration and area.



"
Ti panangaramid ti ania kadagiti sumaganad ket mangkissay ti posibilidad ti panangraut ti ay-ayup?,"The correct answer is **A: Panagitugot kadagiti aromatiko nga herb (Allowing aromatic herbs)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Mainayon pay, ammuem a dagiti angot ket makaawis dagiti oso ken dadduma nga atap a biag..."" (Furthermore, be aware that scents can disturb bears and other wildlife...).  Aromatic herbs fall under this category of scents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panagikkat ti basuraan iti lugar ti pakarso (Not burying trash in the campsite):** While burying trash is good practice, the text *specifically* highlights the danger of *scents* being a problem, not necessarily trash.
* **C: Panagtalinaed ti 25 a yarda a kaadayo manipud kadagiti lobo (Maintaining a 25-yard distance from wolves):**  The text states a general distance for *all* large animals, not just wolves. 25 yards is a distance, but the *scent* aspect is the more direct connection to potential conflict.
* **D: Panangbuteng kadagiti ay-ayup iti maibelleng a makan (Feeding animals with edible food):** The text strongly discourages feeding animals, as it habituates them to humans and increases the likelihood of conflict.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas mabalin a gapu dagiti panangraut ti naatap nga ay-ayup?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti napigsa nga angot (Strong smells)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mainayon pay, ammuem a dagiti angot ket makaawis dagiti oso ken dadduma nga atap a biag..."" (Furthermore, be aware that smells can disturb bears and other wildlife...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Saan a pannakamentenar ti distansia (Not maintaining distance):** The passage *does* mention the importance of maintaining distance. It's a key point.
*   **C: Panangited ti taraon iti naatap nga ayup (Feeding wild animals):** The passage *does* mention not feeding the wild animals. It is a key point.
*   **D: Dagiti ayup a saan a naruam kadagiti tattao (Animals that are not used to people):** The passage doesn't say anything about which animals are used to people. It focuses on all large animals, regardless of habituation.



Therefore, the only option not directly addressed in the text is the impact of strong smells."
