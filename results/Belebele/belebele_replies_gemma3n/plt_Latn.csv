"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto vahaolana manaraka ireto no tsy heverina fa fitsaboana soritr'aretin’ny olana ara-tontolo iainana?","Ny valintsoa dia **A: Firotsahana amin'ny fikatrohana**.

Ity no naseho tamin'ny sombin-dahatsoratra fa tsy vahaolana araka ny filan'ny olona.  Nisy fanasongadina fa tokony hatao ny famongorana ny fototry ny olana mba hahazoana vahaolana tena toavana, fa tsy firotsahana amin'ny fikatrohana fotsiny.  Ny B, C, sy D dia lahatsoratra ho vahaolana fototra sy fomba hampihenana ny olana.

"Taiza ny firenena nisy ady voalohany tany Eoropa, izay nahitana olana fototra teo amin’ny fifandanjan-kery fa tsy ny resaka fivavahana?","The correct answer is **D: Espaina (Spain)**.

The passage states: ""Adin’ny Fifandimbiasana Espaniôla no ady voalohany izay nifototra tamin’ny fifandanjan-kery."" (The Spanish War of Independence was the first war focused on balance of power.)
"
Iza no ady nolazaina indraindray fa ‘ady ara-pivavahana’ farany?,"The correct answer is **A: Ady Telopolo Taona**

The text explicitly states: ""Ny Ady Telopolo Taona no ady farany nolazaina fa ady masina."" (The Thirty Years' War was the last one described as a holy war.)
"
Iza amin'ireto lafin-javatra manaraka ireto tamin'ny Eglizy Katolika no tsy nodinihina lalina?,"The correct answer is **C: Ny fivangongon’ny fahefana ao anatin’ny Fiangonana (The concentration of power within the Church)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights the Church's wealth and power, and questions the legitimacy of the power and wealth it holds. It mentions that the Church was supposed to use its wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty. This inherently points to scrutiny of *how* power was concentrated and exercised within the Church.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Raha nizotra tsara ny fitsinjarana ny harena tao anatin’ny Fiangonana (If the distribution of wealth within the Church had proceeded well):** The passage implies that the distribution of wealth *did not* proceed well, hence the questioning.
* **B: Raha tokony hovaina ny foto-pitsika lehibe tao amin’ny fivavahana (If the major doctrines of the religion should have been changed):** While doctrines were certainly scrutinized, the passage focuses more on the practical application of the Church's wealth and power, rather than doctrine itself.
* **D: Raha notanterahina ny foto-pitsipika lehibe tao amin’ny Fiangonana (If the major principles of the Church had been implemented):**  The passage directly questions whether the Church *did* implement its major principles, specifically regarding wealth and poverty.



Therefore, the concentration of power within the Church is the aspect most directly challenged and scrutinized by the passage.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no nisy namono tao Versailles?","The correct answer is **A: Iray tamin'ireo vehivavy teny an-tsena**.

The text states: ""Tamin’ny fotoana iray dia nanevaeva ny lohan’ny mpiambina fanjakana maty tao Versailles teo alohan’ny mpanjakavavy izay matin’ny tahotra ny olona iray tao amin’ny vahoaka."" This translates to: ""At one point, the head of a dead royal guard was torn off at Versailles before the queen, by a person in the crowd, who was terrified by the people.""  The ""olona iray tao amin’ny vahoaka"" (a person in the crowd) is identified as a woman.
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy nanaovan’ny vahoaka fanerena tamin'ny Mpanjaka sy ny Mpanjakavavy?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny fivoahana tampoka tao Versailles (Leaving Versailles abruptly)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what the crowd *didn't* force the King and Queen to do.**
* The passage states that the crowd **forced** the King and Queen to:
    * Return to Paris (D)
    * Open the doors of their carriage (A)
    * Witness the death of the guardsman (C)
* The passage indicates the return to Paris was forced due to the pressure of the markets and the angry crowds.  The exit from Versailles was *not* a forced action *by the crowd* on the King and Queen; it was a consequence of the growing unrest and pressure, and the King and Queen were compelled to leave.
Therefore, the crowd did not force them to leave Versailles.

"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto ho an'i Grande-Bretagne no tsy vokatry ny ady an-dranomasina nahazatra?,"The correct answer is **C: Natao ny fiovana tamin’ny lalàna iraisam-pirenena**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Taoriana kelin’ny fiantombohan’ny fifandirana dia nanisy sakana ara-tsambo an’I Alemana i Grande Bretagne. Nanafenan’i Grande Bretagne baomba ny ranomasina iraisam-pirenena mba tsy hisakanana ireo sambo mpiady izay miditra anatin’ny faritra ranomasim-be, ka mety hampidi-doza hatramin’ireo sambo tsotra izay mifamezivezy.""  This indicates that Great Britain *violated* international law by deploying naval mines.
* **Options A, B, and D are all consequences of Britain's actions:**
    * **A: Ny fanirian'i Alemaina hampiasa paikady mitovy amin’izany amin’ny ady:**  Britain's use of mines likely inspired Germany to retaliate with similar tactics.
    * **B: Tandindonin-doza ireo sambo tsy misy ifandraisany:** The passage explicitly states that the mines could damage even civilian vessels.
    * **D: Sarotra ny fahtitana ny entana tena ilaina:**  The naval blockade and the potential for damage to ships would have made it difficult for Germany to import essential goods.

* **Option C is the exception:** The passage doesn't say that international law was changed. It says Great Britain *broke* it.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
Fanambarana inona no tsy manoritsoritra mazava tsara ny fanakanan’ny tafika an-dranomasina Britanika an'i Alemaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Nitarika ny ady an-dranomasina tany Alemaina izany (It led to naval warfare in Germany).**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the British naval blockade *of Germany*.** It describes how Britain blocked supplies *to* Germany by patrolling the seas. 
* Options A, C, and D all accurately reflect aspects of the blockade described in the text:
    * **A: Nifanohitra tamin’ny lalàna iraisam-pirenena izany (It contradicted international law):** The passage explicitly states this.
    * **C: Nampiato ny fitobahan’ny famatsiana tany Alemaina izany (It stopped the flow of supplies to Germany):** This is the main goal of the blockade.
    * **D: Nanome antoka izany fa tsy ho tandindomin-doza ny sambo tsy momba ny atsy sy eroa (It ensured that civilian ships would not be sunk):**  The passage mentions the British sank ships *suspected* of aiding the enemy, but implies they tried to avoid sinking non-military vessels.
* **Option B is incorrect because the passage does not say the blockade *led* to naval warfare in Germany.** It says the *German response* was a similar, unrestricted naval blockade. The blockade was a *preemptive action* to stop supplies.



Therefore, option B is the only statement that doesn't accurately reflect the information presented in the passage.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no tena angambaina indrindra ho voan'ny sclérose en plaques?","The correct answer is **A: Vehivavy 32 taona**.

The text states: ""fikarohana fa avo roa heny no mety hahatonga ny sclerosis marobe (MS) amin’ny **vehivavy mihoatra noho ny lehilahy**.""  While the exact age isn't specified, the question is looking for the gender most affected, and the text indicates women are more susceptible than men.  Option A offers a woman's age, making it the best answer amongst the choices. The other options mention men and ages that aren't referenced in the text.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, mila fanohanana bebe kokoa amin'ny inona ny mpandray anjara amin'ny hetsika tsy tapaka?","The correct answer is **A: Eritreritra miiba momba ny fanaintainana (Maladaptive coping with pain)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Those who engage in constant physical activity need more support in **maladaptive coping with pain**, distinguishing between chronic pain and lack of vitality in the body's normal behaviors.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lamosina ambany (Low back pain):** While low back pain might be a symptom, the text focuses on the *coping* mechanisms related to constant physical activity and pain, not just the pain itself.
*   **C: Rari-tsaina (Mental health):** Although mental health can be related, the text specifically mentions issues related to *coping with pain* in the context of physical activity.
*   **D: Tahotra (Anxiety):** The text states that anxiety is related to pain and frustration but the focus of the support needed is in how they *manage* the pain, not the anxiety itself.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, ahoana no fomba mahazatra hilalaovana escrime?","The correct answer is **D: Amin'ny endrika fifanandrinana (In the form of duels)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Fifanandrinan'olon-droa no endrika tena fisehon'ity fanatanjahantena izy, mpilalao sabatra iray mifanandrina amin'ny anankiray hafa."" which translates to ""Duels are the most common form of this sport, where two fencers compete against each other.""

While the sport is played at various levels, the *common* way to play is in duels.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no famantarana matanjaka indrindra ny fanapoizinana anaty?","The correct answer is **D: Tavoahangy misy pilina (A bottle with pills)**.

The text states: ""Ny famantarana tsara indrindra ny fanapoizinana anaty dia mety ho ny fisiana boatim-panafody na vokatra simika fampiasa ao an-trano misy poizina."" (The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of medication or chemical products used at home that are poisonous.)

Option D directly reflects this statement. While the other options (A, B, and C) are symptoms of poisoning, they are not identified as the *best* or primary indicator in the text.  The text emphasizes the physical presence of a poisonous substance.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no dingana voalohany sahaza rehefa manombantombana niharam-boina iray?","The correct answer is **C: Mizaha ny fitoeran'ilay niharam-boina**.

The passage clearly states: ""Mba ho fiarovana ny ainao, mila faritanao tsara ny toerana misy ilay niharam-boina ary izay fambara loza mazava rehetra rehefa manatona azy ianao."" (To protect your life, you must carefully identify the location of the injured person and any clear emergency warnings before approaching them.)

This means the first step is to assess the scene and the location of the injured person.
"
Iza amin'ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no tsy ahitana taratra mazava ny fizotry ny fizahana niharam-boina?,"The correct answer is **A: Aza manahy ny amin’ny ratra mety ahazo anao (Don't worry about the potential liability you may face)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes safety and assessing the scene.** Option A completely disregards the immediate safety concerns and focusing on the victim's potential legal ramifications. It's irrelevant to the procedure of assessing the situation.

Let's look at why the other options *do* relate to assessing the situation:

* **B: Manombana ny toerana manodidina manoloana ilay niharam-boina (Assess the area around the injured person):** This is crucial for safety and identifying hazards.
* **C: Diniho ny fomba itoeran'ilay niharam-boina (Examine the position of the injured person):**  Understanding how the person is positioned can give clues about the nature of their injuries.
* **D: Andramo marihana ny saina mena rehetra (Note all signs of shock):** Recognizing signs of shock is essential for providing appropriate care.



Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't relate to the process of assessing the injured person and their environment.



"
Iza tamin'ireo fiovana vokatry ny Revolisiona Frantsay no nisy fiantraikany goavana teo amin'ny olom-pirenena amin’ny sarangan’ny mpiasa?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny fiovan’ny fironan’ny saranga mankany amin'ny fahombiazana.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Taorian’ny Tolom-piavotana ihany koa dia nisokatra ho an’ny lehilahy mpitady asa rehetra ny asa hany ka manome fahafahana ireo mikendry lavitra sy mahomby indrindra hahomby."" This directly links the Revolution to a shift in the social hierarchy, emphasizing opportunity based on ability and success, rather than birth or privilege.  This is a significant change for working people.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ny fanohanana nitombo ho an’ny firenena:** While the revolution did foster a sense of national support, the question asks about the impact on working-class *social standing*.
* **C: Ny fanarahana firehan-kevitra Repoblikana:**  Republican ideals were important, but the passage focuses more on the *economic* impact on working people.
* **D: Ny rafitra fepetra vaovao:**  The passage mentions a new system of merit in the military, but doesn't elaborate on a broader ""new system of rules"" that fundamentally changed the social hierarchy for workers.



Therefore, the shift in social standing towards a merit-based system (B) is the most significant impact on the working class mentioned in the passage.
"
"Taorian'ny Revolisiona Frantsay, ny fahombiazana teo amin'ny tafika sy ny asa atao hafa dia tsy dia nifototra loatra tamin'ny inona?","The correct answer is **C: Zotom-po (Talent)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after the French Revolution, success in both the military and other professions became less dependent on ""what"" you were (like social class) and more dependent on **""your strength""** (the ability to achieve).  This directly implies a shift towards valuing **talent (zotom-po)** and ability rather than social standing or other factors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zava-bita (Achievements):** While achievements are important, the passage is saying they weren't *the* primary factor determining success anymore.
*   **B: Saranga (Luck):**  The passage emphasizes ability and strength, not luck.
*   **D: Calibre (Quality/Standard):** While calibre might be a factor, the passage focuses on a shift *away from* inherent qualities or social status. The emphasis is on demonstrated ability.

Iza amin’ireo sampan-draharaham-panjakana no lazaina fa miteraka fahasorenana be indrindra any amin’ireo firenena mandroso?,"Ny valintsoa tsara indrindra dia **C: Fitateram-bahoaka**.

Ity no nantsoratra tamin'ny valintsoa: ""Any amin’ny tany mandroso mahalana ianao no maheno fitarainana mahakasika ny kalitaon’ny rano na tetezana mianjera. Saika mitaraina amin’ny rafitra fitaterana avokoa ny olona rehetra. Nahoana àry ny rafitra fitanterana no miteraka fitarainana tahak’izany, nahoana ry zareo no tsy mahomby isanandro? Ny enjenieran’ny fitaterana ve no tena tsy mahay? Sa misy zavatra hafa mitranga ifotony?""

Izany dia manasongadina fa ny rafitra fitaterana no mahazo ny fitarainana sy ny fahasorenana lehibe indrindra, na dia mitsirairay aza ny olona amin'ny fampiasana ny fitaterana.  Ity dia manazava fa ny fitateram-bahoaka dia mety tsy mahomby isanandro ary miteraka fahasorenana be indrindra any amin'ireo firenena mandroso.

Ny sampan-draharaham-panjakana hafa (A, B, sy D) dia mety manasongadina fahasorenana, saingy tsy ny fitateram-bahoaka no fahasorenana lehibe indrindra amin'ireo firenena mandroso, araka ny lazaina.
"
"Araka ny andalana, inona no azo lazaina momba ny rafitra fitateram-bahoaka?","The correct answer is **C: Betsaka ny fitarainana ataon'ireo mampiasa azy** (Many complaints are made by its users).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Any amin’ny tany mandroso mahalana ianao no maheno fitarainana mahakasika ny kalitaon’ny rano na tetezana mianjera."" (In developed, expensive countries, there are fewer complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges).
* The passage also states: ""Saika mitaraina amin’ny rafitra fitaterana avokoa ny olona rehetra."" (Everyone is trying to complain about the transportation system).

This implies that people are complaining *a lot* about the transportation system, even if the complaints are less frequent in wealthier countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tena tian'ny olona rehetra mampiasa azy** (Everyone who uses it really likes it) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies.
* **B: Tsy dia ratsy noho ny kalitaon'ny rano izy** (It's not bad because of water quality) - The passage mentions complaints about water quality and bridges, suggesting there *are* issues.
* **D: Maimaim-poana izany any amin'ny ankamaroan'ny firenena mandroso** (It's constantly improving in most developed countries) - The passage indicates that complaints are *less frequent* in developed countries, not that it's constantly improving.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no sarotra refesina ny fatrany noho ny tsy fahazoa-maminany an’ireo mpamily?","The correct answer is **A: Hafainganam-pandehan’ny fifamoivoizana (Speed of traffic)**.

The passage states: ""Indrisy, sarotra ny manao fikarohana momba ny fifamoivozana satria tsy afaka manao tombana marina zato isan-jato ny fitondrantenan’ireo mpamily."" This directly translates to ""Unfortunately, it is difficult to conduct research on traffic because it is not possible to make accurate estimates of the driving behavior of drivers in hundreds of cases.""  This difficulty directly impacts accurately measuring the speed of traffic.

The other options are impacted by traffic, but not to the same degree of difficulty in estimation as speed:

* **B: Fandaminana ny lalana (Road planning)** - While traffic affects road planning, the core issue isn't estimating driving behavior.
* **C: Fanamboarana ny lalana (Road improvement)** - Similar to planning, improvement is not as directly tied to the difficulty of estimating driving behavior.
* **D: Fikorianan’ny fivezivezena (Traffic flow)** -  Traffic flow *is* related to speed, but the passage specifically highlights the difficulty in estimating driver *behavior*, which directly affects speed.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**."
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no ampiasaina hanehoana ny fifamoivoizana amin'ny fomba matematika?,"The correct answer is **C: Fanomezana endrika ny lalana (Formalization of traffic rules)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Soa ihany, mazàna dia tafiditra anaty faritra tsy miovaova ny fitondrantenan’ny mpamily; noho izany, manana endrika tsy dia miovaova ny fivezivezen’ny fifamoivoizana matetika ka azo aseho amin’ny fomba matematika."" (Fortunately, driver behavior falls within a relatively unchanging area; therefore, traffic behavior often has a fixed form that can be shown mathematically.)
* **It continues:** ""Mba hahafahana maneho tsara kokoa ny fifamoivoizana dia nampifandraisina ireo toetra telo lehibe mampiavaka : (1) ny fikoriana (2) ny hakitroka, ary (3) ny hafainganana. Ireo fifandraisana ireo dia manampy amin’ny fandrindrana, fanamboarana, sy fitrandrahana ny làlana."" (To better express traffic, three main distinguishing characteristics were linked: (1) aggression (2) rudeness, and (3) speed. These relationships help in the planning, improvement, and design of roads.)
* **The passage connects the mathematical representation of traffic behavior to the planning and design of roads.**  Formalizing traffic rules *is* a key aspect of planning, improving, and designing roads *mathematically*.  It allows for the creation of systems that can be analyzed and optimized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fanamboarana ny lalana (Improving traffic rules):** While related, it's not the primary *method* of representing traffic mathematically.
* **B: Fihetsiky ny mpamily (Driver behavior):** Driver behavior is *what* is being represented, not the method of representation itself. It's too broad.
* **D: Ny habetsahan’ny fifamoivoizana (Volume of traffic):** This is a measure of traffic, but not a way to formally represent it mathematically.

Therefore, **C** is the best fit because it directly aligns with the passage's emphasis on using mathematical forms to represent and ultimately plan traffic systems."
Inona no nampiasain'i Hershey sy Chase mba hametrahana ny ADN? ,"The correct answer is **C: Solifara radiôaktifa**.

Here's why:

*   The question states Hershey and Chase used radioactive sulfur to label the *proteins* of the phage, and radioactive phosphorus to label the *DNA* of the phage.
*   The option that aligns with radioactive phosphorus is **C: Solifara radiôaktifa** (radioactive sulfur is often referred to as radioactive phosphorus in this context, though the question uses ""solifara"" which translates to sulfur, it's the closest answer).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fôsfôrô radiôaktifa** (Radioactive phosphorus) - This was used to label the DNA, not the method used to *introduce* the DNA.
*   **B: Fitaovana zenetika** (Genetic tools) - This is too general. While the experiment involved genetic material, it doesn't specify the tools used.
*   **D: Virosy** (Viruses) - They used bacteriophages (phages), which are viruses that infect bacteria, but this doesn't answer *how* the DNA was introduced.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is C."
Miankina amin'ny inona ny fahafahana mifindra amin'ny fiovana mankany amin’ny taranaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Raha toa ka lignée germinale ny sela (If the cell is germline)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Fiovàn’ny sela vokarin’ny mpamokatra ihany no afaka mifindra amin’ny zanaka..."" (Changes in cells producing gametes only can be passed on to offspring...).  The gametes (sperm and egg cells) are part of the germline.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ny maha-zava-dehibe ny fitaovana zenetika (The importance of genetic machinery):** While genetic machinery is important for DNA replication and repair, the passage focuses on *where* the mutation occurs, not the general genetic machinery.
* **C: Ny karazana fiovana (The type of mutation):** The passage mentions the type of mutation influencing the impact (e.g., cell death), but doesn't directly link the *type* of mutation to heritability.  It's the *location* that matters.
* **D: Raha miteraka fahafatesana sela ny fiovana (If the mutation causes cell death):** Cell death can prevent a mutation from being passed on, but it doesn't determine heritability in general. The key is whether the cell is germline or somatic.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**."
"Araka ny fampahalalana nosoratana, tsy miankina amin'ny inona ny vokatry ny fiovana samihafa?","The correct answer is **B: Raha toa ka lignée germinale ny sela voakasika (If the affected cell is germline)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The cell division of the germline cells only can be transmitted to the offspring..."" This directly indicates that whether the affected cell is part of the germline (cells that produce gametes - sperm and egg) is the key factor determining if the change is passed on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Firy amin'ny fitaovana zenetika no voakasika (How many genetic elements are affected):**  While the number of affected genetic elements *can* influence the severity of the change, the passage emphasizes the location (germline vs. somatic) as the primary determinant of inheritance.
* **C: Ny maha-zava-dehibe ny fototarazo voakasika (The importance of the affected chromosome):**  The passage does mention the importance of the affected chromosome, but again, the crucial factor is whether the cell is a germline cell.  Changes on a non-germline cell won't be passed on.
* **D: Ny karazana fiovana voakasika (The type of change affected):** The type of change (mutation type) is mentioned as important for *understanding* the change, but it doesn't determine inheritance. A change, regardless of its type, only gets passed on if it occurs in a germline cell.



Therefore, the inheritance of a genetic change hinges on whether the cell containing the change is a germline cell or not.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy antony niompian’ny kolontsaina fahiny osy?,"The correct answer is **B: Nanampy tamin’ny firaohanana ahitra izy (They helped with cutting firewood)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the primary reasons for raising goats were for **meat (volo/hena)**, **wool (volo)**, and **skin (hoditra)**.  The text also mentions they were useful for **easy identification**.  The text describes goat herding as similar to sheep herding, implying they were primarily livestock for these resources.

While goats *might* have indirectly helped with collecting firewood (by eating brush, for example), it wasn't a primary or intentional reason for their domestication.  The other options are directly mentioned as benefits of having goats:

*   **A: Nanome hena izy (They provided meat):**  The text clearly says goats were raised for meat.
*   **C: Natao namana izy (They were used as a trading commodity):** While not directly stated as a reason for domestication, the text implies their value and use in trade by mentioning their value for their wool, skin, and meat.
*   **D: Nanome ronono izy (They provided milk):**  Goats are known for producing milk, and milk is a valuable resource. The text mentions their wool, meat, and skin, but does not exclude milk.



Therefore, option B is the one that doesn't align with the reasons given in the text."
Ny tanjon'ny fanaovana golf dia ny maka inona amin’ny isa kely indrindra?,"The correct answer is **B: Stokes**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""The player who scores the fewest number of strokes to complete the course wins.""
*   In golf, a **stroke** is the basic unit of scoring.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Baolina** (Ball) is used in the game, but not the unit of scoring.
*   **Fotoana** (Time) is not a factor in determining the winner in standard golf.
*   **Lavaka** (Hole) is part of the course, but not the scoring unit.

"
"Amin'ny kianja fanaovana golf, aiza no tena fohy kokoa ny bozaka?","The correct answer is **C: Amin'ny lavaka voalohany**.

The passage states: ""Lavaka vao ambin’ny folo no lalaovina raha ny tokony ho izy, manomboka eo amin’ny lavaka voalohany matetika ny mpilalao ary miafara amin’ny fahavalo ambin’ny folo."" This means the first hole (lavaka voalohany) is the shortest.
"
Inona no tanjona ankapobeny amin'ny fanaovana andrana?,"The correct answer is **A: Mba hanafoanana ny iray na maromaro amin’ny petrakevitra mety ho hita.**

The text explicitly states: ""Ny fanandramana, sy ny andrana dia fitsapana izay ampiasaina mba **hanilihana petrakevitra iray na maromaro mety hisy**..."" which translates to ""Experiments and trials are tests used to **rule out one or more possible hypotheses**...""

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the purpose of experiments as described in the passage.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy manampy amin'ny fitarihana fikarohana ara-tsiansa?","The correct answer is **B: Ny fanaovana fanamarihana (Making assumptions)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that scientific inquiry is driven by posing questions and conducting investigations.
* **The scientific method (ilay fomba atao ara-tsiantifika mihintsy)** is the *primary* way to conduct scientific research, not something that hinders it.
* **Testing and experiments (ny fanandramana, sy ny andrana)** are used to eliminate possibilities, *leading to* scientific discovery.
* **Fanafoanana ireo petrakevitra mety ho hita (Eliminating possible hypotheses)** is a key step in the scientific process.
* **Making assumptions (Ny fanaovana fanamarihana)** is the *opposite* of the scientific method. Science relies on evidence and testing, not on simply assuming something to be true. Assumptions are not a reliable basis for scientific inquiry.

Therefore, making assumptions is the action that *doesn't* contribute to leading scientific research, according to the text.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, fanambarana inona momba ny tadio no tsy marina?","The correct answer is **B: Mamely faritra kely kokoa noho ny tafiotra hafa ny tadio (Tornadoes affect a smaller area than other storms).**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that tornadoes, despite being relatively short-lived, can damage *everything* in their path (""Nikasika faritra kelikely ny tafio-drivotra raha oharina amin’ny tafiotra mahery hafa, kanefa afaka manimba izay rehetra lalovany."").
*   The text says that many tornadoes last over three hours (""Ny roa isan-jatony tena mahery amin’ny tafiotra maharitra mihoatra ny adiny telo ny tafiodrivotra."").
*   It also mentions that wind speeds can reach 480 km/h (""Ny rivo-doza mahery vaika dia nandrivotra hatramin’ny 480 km/ora"").
*   Finally, it states that some tornadoes can reach speeds of 300 mph (""Mety mahatratra hatramin’ny 300 maily isan'ora ny rivotra entin’ny tadio sasany"").

Therefore, the only inaccurate statement is that tornadoes affect a smaller area than other storms, as the text emphasizes their ability to cause widespread damage along their path."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra tsara ny ankamaroan'ny tadio?","The best answer is **A: Matetika izy ireo no maharitra hatramin’ny adiny telo mahery (They often last for more than three hours)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Roa isan-jatony tena mahery amin’ny tafiotra, maharitra mihoatra ny adiny telo ny roa isan-jatony tena mahery amin’ny tafiotra.""  (Two hundred and forty-two tornadoes last more than three hours.) This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

* **B: Manodidina ny 480 maily isan’ora izy ny rivotra foroniny (Their winds reach around 480 mph.)** While the text *does* mention wind speeds up to 480 km/h, it's not a defining characteristic of the *tornadoes* themselves. It's a maximum wind speed they can generate.
* **C: Ny faritra midadasika kokoa noho ny an’ny tafiotra hafa no handalovany (Their destructive power is greater than that of other storms.)** The text mentions they can destroy things, but it doesn't compare their destructive power to other storms.
* **D: Vitany ny manongotra hazo amin’ny fotony (They can uproot trees at their roots.)** This is a specific example of damage, not a general characteristic of tornadoes.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and encompassing description of tornadoes based on the provided text."
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no nanomboka nataon’ny olombelona tamin’ny taonjato faha-16?,"The correct answer is **D: Fanamboarana teleskaopy**.

The text states: ""Na izany aza, ny tena teleskaopy voalohany dia namboarina tao Eorôpa tamin’ny faran’ny taonjato faha 16."" (However, the first true telescope was built in Europe in the late 16th century.)

While people had been using lenses for magnification for a long time (mentioned in the first sentence), the first *telescopes* were developed in the 16th century.
"
Hafiriana no nampiasan’ny olombelona solomaso loupe hanalehibeazana ny zavatra jerena?,"The correct answer is **A: Nandritra ny arivo taona**.

The first sentence of the text states: ""Efa nanamboatra sy nampiasa fitaratra fanalehibiazana efa ho aman’arivony taona.""  This directly answers the question about how long humans have used magnifying glasses for magnification.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no lazain’ny zohin’i Muhammad momba ny fomba fanao ara-panahy na ny soatoaviny?","The correct answer is **A: Omeny soatovina ny fiadanana sy ny fitokana-monina**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Muhammad would retreat to a cave called ""Hira"" in the ""Noor"" (light) mountain to contemplate. It emphasizes the complete isolation of the cave - no one could easily find it, and once inside, it was completely secluded. This seclusion points directly to the importance of peace and solitude in his spiritual practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Afaka manampy amin'ny fisaintsainana ny tabataba avy any ivelany:** The passage states that nothing from the outside could be seen or heard within the cave.
* **C: Kely ihany ny fotoana nilainy samirery:** The passage mentions he would spend ""long hours"" in contemplation.
* **D: Nampanahy azy ny ho hita sy hisy handre:**  The entire description focuses on the *absence* of being seen or heard, indicating the opposite – a preference for seclusion.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no nampiasana ny vy voalohany?","The correct answer is **D: Lalamby**.

The text states: ""Tamin’ny 1767, nampidirana ireo lalamby voalohany."" which translates to ""In 1767, the first **rails** were introduced.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, nahoana no nosoloina kodiaram-by ny kodiaran-kazo?","The correct answer is **D: Potiky ny vy teo amin'ny lalamby izy.**

The text states: ""Nosoloina kodiarana vy ireo kodiarana hazo ny farany. Nosoloina izy ireo noho fa nanimba bebe kokoa ny kodiarana hazon’ny kalesin-dalamby ilay vy.""  This translates to: ""The wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. They were replaced because the iron was damaging the wooden wheels of the carriage.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no namolavola ny olona nandritra ny vanim-potoan'ny Romantisma?","The correct answer is **B: Jeografia**.

The text explicitly states: ""Eo amin’ny sehatry ny Romantisima, namolavola ny olona ny jeografia..."" which translates to ""In the realm of Romanticism, people shaped geography..."" 

Therefore, geography is the answer.

Iza amin'ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no tsy ahitana taratra ny hevitra ankapoben’ny determinisma teknolojika? ,"The correct answer is **B: Tsy miantraika ny fivoaran'ny teknolojia ny kolontsaina (Technological development does not affect society's culture).**

Here's why:

* **Technological determinism** fundamentally argues that technology drives societal change, often independently of other factors like culture and politics. Option B directly contradicts this by stating that culture has *no* effect on technological development.  This is the opposite of what technological determinism posits.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with technological determinism:

* **A: Misy fepetra arahin’ny fiarahamonina ny fiantraikan'ny teknolojia ara-tsosialy (Society sets constraints on the social impact of technology):**  This acknowledges the *impact* of technology, a core concern of determinism. It also hints at how society reacts to and adapts to technological changes, which deterministic views often analyze.
* **C: Misy fiantraikany raiki-tapisaka amin'ny fiarahamonina ny teknolojia (Technology has a ripple effect on society):** This is a classic deterministic argument. Technology initiates a chain of events that fundamentally alters society.  The ""ripple effect"" is a key concept in understanding how technology's influence expands.
* **D: Tsy miainga amin’ny fitaomana ara-politika ny fivoaran’ny teknolojia (Technological development does not originate from political factors):** This is a strong deterministic statement. It positions technology as driven by internal technological logic rather than external political pressures.  Determinism often argues that technological advancement happens regardless of political will or circumstances.



Therefore, only option B directly opposes the central tenets of technological determinism.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy misy ifandraisany amin'ny fanenjanana ny renitsipìka?","The correct answer is **D: Ny fanombohana amin'ny ivon’ny arc (The starting point from the center of the arc)**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states that ""Ny marika “archet miakatra” dia tahaka ny V ary ny """"marika archet midina” dia tahaka ny vy kely fanambarana taratasy na efajoro tsy misy ny zorony ambany.""  This describes how to *mark* the arc, not where to *start* drawing it.
* The text connects upward strokes (""archet miakatra"") with softer sounds and downward strokes (""archet midina"") with louder sounds.
* Options A, B, and C (Feo moramora kokoa, Marika toy ny mizaijaitra, Feo mafy kokoa) are all directly linked to the sound and visual representation of the arc strokes.  Option D addresses the starting point, which isn't discussed in terms of sound or visual characteristics related to the archet.

Therefore, ""Ny fanombohana amin'ny ivon’ny arc"" is the least relevant to the topic of the archet's sound and visual markings as described in the passage.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no mifandray amin'ny feo malefaka kokoa?","The correct answer is **A: Ny mariky ny zanatsipìka midina (The descending archet mark)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Malefaka kokoa ny feo re avy amin’ny tsipìka rehefa tifirina miakatra, fa mafy kokoa ny feony rehefa tifirina midina."" (The sound from the bow is softer when drawing up, but louder when drawing down.)

The ""marika archet midina"" (descending archet mark) is described as the ""vy kely fanambarana taratasy na efajoro tsy misy ny zorony ambany"" (a small mark indicating a piece of paper or a kite without a lower corner) and it indicates that you should start from the hausse (the place where your hand touches the archet) and then adjust the archet. This describes the action of drawing the archet *down*, which results in a louder sound.  The *upward* drawing (the ""marika toy ny V"" or V-shaped mark) results in a softer sound."
Mampiseho ny fôsily fa ny tanana dia natao indrindra ho ampiasaina amin’ny iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto?,"The correct answer is **A: Fikirakirana (Writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the hands of *hominids* (early humans) changed from being used for climbing to being used for manipulating objects.  The fossil evidence shows a decrease in the size of the hands relative to the feet, suggesting a shift away from climbing and towards other activities.  Crucially, it mentions that fossils from 2-3 million years ago show the hands evolving *from* climbing *to* grasping and manipulating objects – a key skill for writing and tool use.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Fivesarana lanja (Carrying heavy loads):** While the passage mentions hands being used to hold body weight while walking, the primary evolutionary shift isn't about carrying loads.
* **C: Fihetsika (Movement):**  This is too broad. While hands are involved in movement, the passage specifically highlights a shift *away* from climbing movement.
* **D: Fihetsehan’ny tonon-taolana (Sound production):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the hands' role in sound production.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra tsara ny vanin-dratsan’ny chimpanzé? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ampiasaina hivesarana lanja izy**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tsy tahaka ireo rajako sasany ny “hominides” noho izy ireo tsy mampiasa ny tanany intsony rehefa mamindra na mibata zavatra na koa rehefa mihanika hazo.""  This implies that chimpanzees *do* use their hands for things like climbing and manipulating objects.
* **The passage further explains:** ""Ny tanan’ny olombelona dia fohy noho ny tongony, ary ny rantsan-tanany dia mahitsy kokoa."" This contrasts the hand structure of hominids with those of apes like chimpanzees.
* **Option C directly aligns with the information about chimpanzees using their hands for balance and locomotion:** This is a key characteristic of chimpanzees that distinguishes them from hominids.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mahitsy kokoa noho ny an’ny olombelona’ izy:** The passage says hominid hands are *more* flexible than chimpanzee hands.
* **B: Samy hafa ny haben'ny tanany sy ny tongony:** While there are differences, the passage focuses on the use of the hands for balance, not just size.
* **D: Natao hikirakirana aloha izy voalohany indrindra:** The passage states that the hand changed from climbing to manipulation over time, not that manipulation was the original purpose.



"
Ny fifantenana dia manafoana ny fiovana zenetika vaovao avy amin'ny andiana inona?,"The correct answer is **A: Miafina**.

The question states: ""Manaisotra izany amin’ny fitambaran'ny fiovaovana miseho ny fifantenana."" This translates to: ""Selection acts against the combination of new mutations of the **masked** type."" 

Therefore, selection acts against the masked mutations.
"
Inona no dingana hanaovana ny fanampiana fiovana zenetika?,"The correct answer is **C: Fampiofohana (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Manampy fiovaovana ara-pototarazo vaovao ny fiovan'ny fototarazo..."" This directly translates to ""Mutation adds new genetic variation...""  Mutation *is* the process that creates new genetic variation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fanokana-monina (Population isolation):** This is the process where populations become separated, which *can* lead to genetic differences, but it's not the direct mechanism of introducing genetic variation.
*   **B: Fampikambanana (Fertilization):** This is the process of sexual reproduction where gametes (sperm and egg) combine. It increases genetic diversity by combining genes from two parents, but it doesn't *create* new genetic variation.
*   **D: Manokana (Specialization):** This is not a relevant term in genetics or evolution.

Therefore, **fampiofohana (mutation)** is the direct action that creates new genetic variation, as stated in the passage."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra ao amin’ny fanazavana, iza amin’ireo no tokony hohanin’ny primate mba hamahana ny “olana momba ny proteina”?","The correct answer is **C: Valala**.

Here's why:

The text states that primates, especially those with a diet similar to humans, have difficulty obtaining all the necessary amino acids from plants alone. The text then highlights that animal sources (like insects, rodents, and lizards) are easier to digest and provide a complete protein profile.  It concludes by suggesting that our ancestors likely supplemented their protein needs with insects.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Valala** because the text explicitly mentions insects as a readily available and complete protein source that primates likely relied on. The other options (leaves, vegetables, and bark) are mentioned as being difficult to digest and lacking a complete amino acid profile.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto olana manaraka ireto no tsy avy amin’ny tsy fahampian'ny asidra amine tena ilaina?","The correct answer is **C: Fitomboana mahaketraka (Stunted growth)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the lack of essential amino acids leads to stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
* Options B (Malnutrition) and D (Death) are direct consequences mentioned in the text.
* Option A (Problems with food digestion) is implied, as the passage discusses the difficulty primates have in digesting plant-based protein. However, it's the *lack of amino acids* that *causes* these digestion problems in the context of the passage.

Therefore, stunted growth is the only option listed that's described as a direct consequence of the *absence* of essential amino acids, making it the best fit for the question.

Ahoana no anehoan'ireo mpikambana ao amin'ny sobakolontsaina manokana ny fifandraisany amin'ny vondrona?,"The correct answer is **D: Amin'ny fampiasana fomba ho toy ny endrika marika (Through the use of markers such as fashion, customs, and slang).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ireo mpikambana ao anatin’ny zana-kolontsaina dia manampahafantatra matetika ny maha mpikambana azy amin’ny alalan’ny fampiasana amin’ny fomba miavaka ny fomba fiainany, izay ahitana lamaody, ny fombafomba, ary ny tenin-jatovo."" This directly links the use of fashion, customs, and slang as markers of belonging.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Amin'ny fiezahana hifanerasera (By trying to assimilate):** Assimilation is a process of *becoming* part of the group, not *showing* belonging. While it might be a consequence, it's not the primary way members *display* their connection.
* **B: Amin'ny fanarahana ny finoan'ny olona rehetra manodidina azy (By following the beliefs of everyone around them):**  While shared beliefs can be a part of a subculture, simply following others' beliefs doesn't necessarily signify belonging; it could indicate conformity.
* **C: Amin'ny fanekena ny fenitry ny fiarahamonina (By acknowledging the norms of society):** This is more related to general societal norms, not specifically to demonstrating belonging within a subculture.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ohatra, ireo ankizy mahatsapa tena ho anatina foko vitsy an’isa izay voatsaratsara fahatany ho tsy dia mahay an-dakilasy dia lasa tsy mahay ao am-pianarana rehefa fantany ny momba ilay fitsaratsarana ivelany mifandray amin’ny firazanany."" (For example, children who feel they belong to a minority group who are stereotyped as not being good at academics become less proficient in school when they are aware of the external stereotype related to their race.)

This directly links the awareness of racial stereotypes to a change in their *behavior* (performance in school).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ny fokon’olona vitsy an'isa nosafidiny hisehoana (The minority group they identify with):** While the passage mentions minority groups, it doesn't say the stereotype *affects* the group itself. It affects the *children* who belong to the group.
* **C: Ny fifandraisan'izy ireo amin'ny ankizy hafa (Their relationships with other children):** The passage doesn't specifically address how racial stereotypes affect relationships with other children.
* **D: Ny famaritany ny atao hoe firazanana (The definition of what is meant by race):**  The passage focuses on how stereotypes *related to* race affect children, not on the definition of race itself.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."

Here's why:

The text describes ""child-wolves"" (mpirenireny) as individuals who, due to lack of care, neglect, or abuse, did not have proper human interaction during their development. They often exhibit behaviors associated with animals, like fear or indifference towards humans. This suggests a deep-seated lack of trust and connection with society.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Miaina mahaleotena (Lives independently):** While difficult, independence doesn't inherently disqualify someone from caring for a child-wolf.
* **B: Mahay mandresy lahatra amin’ny resaka (Good at persuading in conversation):** Persuasion could potentially be useful in managing a child-wolf's behavior.
* **C: Mitokatoka-monina (Nomadic):**  Nomadic lifestyles don't automatically preclude someone from caring for a child-wolf.

Therefore, the lack of self-confidence in society aligns best with the described characteristics of a child-wolf and makes it the least suitable trait for someone to care for them. They would likely struggle to connect and build a trusting relationship.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that subsistence farming is for producing *enough food for the farmer and their family only*.  Selling surplus production goes against this core principle.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with subsistence farming:

* **A: Miompana amin'ny vokatra mahafeno ny filan'ny fianakavian'ny mpamboly (Producing enough crops to meet the family's needs)** - This is the definition of subsistence farming.
* **C: Miompana amin'ny famokarana betsaka mifanohitra amin’ny teknika mandroso (Producing a lot with simple techniques)** -  The text mentions simple techniques and maximizing yields *within* those constraints.
* **D: Fizarana masomboly eo an-toerana any amin'ny faritry ny mpamboly (Storing seeds on-site within the farmer's area)** - This is a common practice in subsistence farming to ensure future planting.



Therefore, option B is the only one that contradicts the definition and purpose of subsistence farming as described in the text.

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ny tantara no jerena dia mamboly mba hivelomana ny ankamaroan’ireo mpamboly, ary mbola izany no zava-misy any amin’ny firenena maro an-dalam-pandrosoana."" (Looking at history, farming was done to sustain the farmers and their families, and this is still the case in many developing countries.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Rafitra organika tanteraka izy io:** While traditional farming often incorporates organic practices, the text doesn't specify it as a fully organic system. It mentions stored seeds and using the environment sustainably, but doesn't confirm a *completely* organic system.
* **B: Mampiasa teknika tsy manam-paharoa izy io mba hampitomboana faran’izay betsaka ny vokatra:** The text describes a *simple* system, not one using unique or advanced techniques for maximizing yield.
* **C: Ahafahan’ny mpamboly mizara ny vokatra azony manerana ny faritra misy azy izy io:**  The text focuses on sustaining the farmer and their family, not necessarily on distributing surplus across a wider area.

Therefore, option D directly reflects the information provided in the text about the continued use of this farming method in many developing countries.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as accurate:

* **Fizahantany fandraharahana (Business tourism):** This is related to travel for business purposes, like conferences and meetings.
* **Fizahantany fialamboly (Leisure tourism):** While visiting a historical house *can* be a leisure activity, it's not the defining characteristic.  It's more specifically about cultural enrichment.
* **Fizahantany ankalamanjana (Ecotourism):** This focuses on responsible travel to natural areas, conserving the environment and improving the well-being of local people.  While a historical house might be *in* a natural area, the primary focus of visiting it isn't ecotourism.

The paragraph states: ""In this instance, recalling past examples of leadership in management and successes achieved through them helped people to open themselves to new changes and new paths for the congregation within the space."" This directly links recalling successful examples of management practices to reducing fear of change.

While other options are related to the paragraph's content, they are not the *specific* thing mentioned as helping to reduce fear of change.

This translates to: ""Even if knowing the history of an individual doesn't mean absorbing the culture, it at least helps people understand their place in the history of the organization.""

Therefore, understanding individual histories helps people understand where they fit *within* the organization's history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mampihena ny tahotry ny fiovana** - While the text mentions that recalling past successes can reduce fear of change, this isn't the primary benefit of understanding individual histories.
* **B: Manamafy ny soatoavina** -  The text doesn't directly link individual histories to strengthening values.
* **D: Manatsara ny fihetsika fanao amin’ny fandraharahana** - The text mentions that past successes related to management can inspire change, but it doesn't say understanding individual histories *improves* daily business practices.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the personal and contextual nature of learning.** It highlights that learning happens in the interaction between the learner and the information, and that the relevance and potential use of that information are key. 
* **Option B directly reflects this.** It suggests focusing on learning experiences that feel meaningful and connected to one's life. This aligns perfectly with the post-modern view that there's no single ""best"" way to learn, and what works depends on the individual and their context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mahasoa kokoa noho ny hafa ny traikefa fianarana sasany:** This contradicts the post-modern idea of rejecting universal ""best"" methods.
* **C: Tsara kokoa noho ny hafa ny fomba fianarana sasany:**  Again, this conflicts with the passage's core argument against a single optimal learning approach.
* **D: Tsy misy ny tanteraka amin'ny fianarana:** While the passage questions traditional forms of learning, it doesn't deny learning altogether.  It's about *how* learning occurs in a post-modern context.



Therefore, **B** best captures the essence of the post-modern approach to learning as described in the passage."

Here's why:

* **The passage argues *against* learning things that won't be applied.** The central idea is that learning happens in the interaction between the learner and the information. If there's no interaction or application, the learning is ineffective. Option D directly contradicts this argument by suggesting that such knowledge is ""worthy"" of learning.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage's ideas:

* **A: Misy fomba maro hianarana momba ny vaovao (There are many ways to learn about the news):**  This aligns with the passage's idea that learning happens in various interactions, not just formal education.
* **B: Tokony hatao laharam-pahamehana mihoatra ny hafa ny traikefa fianarana sasany (Some learning experiences should be prioritized over others):** This suggests that not all learning experiences are equal in value, which is consistent with the passage's critique of ineffective learning.
* **C: Miankina amin'ny mpianatra sy ny fahalalana atolotra ny traikefa fianarana (The learning experience depends on the learner and the information provided):**  This is a direct restatement of the passage's main point.



Therefore, option D is the only one that doesn't reflect the passage's core argument.

"Taorian'ny fifohazana niniana nandritra ny fotoanan'ny torimaso mahazatra, iza amin'ireto no mety tafiditra amin’ny fizotry ny fahatapahan'ny torimaso?","The correct answer is **D: Mifoha mba hisotro rano amin'ny tavoahangy eo an-doham-pandrinanao.**

Here's why:

The passage states that for a deep sleep experience (like a lucid dream), you need to disrupt the sleep cycle. It mentions:

*   **Drinking water:**  Drinking water beforehand forces you to wake up to urinate.
*   **Setting an alarm:** Setting an alarm and having it wake you up forces you to break out of the deep sleep.

Option D aligns perfectly with this, as waking up to drink water is a common technique to interrupt the sleep cycle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mamaky boky adiny iray sy sasany alohan'ny hatoriana indray:** This is a relaxing activity but doesn't necessarily disrupt the sleep cycle.
*   **B: Misaika ary miverena any am-pandriana indray:** This is simply going back to sleep and doesn't involve interrupting the deep sleep.
*   **C: Mamono ny fanairana eo an-doham-pandriana ary matory roapolo minitra aorian'izay:** The passage doesn't mention killing an alarm clock, and it's not a recommended technique. Also, only 20 minutes is unlikely to produce a deep sleep experience.

Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no mamaritra marina momba ny fahatapahan'ny torimaso?,"The correct answer is **C: Mandritra ny fotoanan’ny torimasonao mahazatra no miseho izy io.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ny fahatapahan’ny torimaso dia dingana famohazana fanahy iniana mandritry ny fotoana mahazatra atorianao sy hiverenanao matory mandritry fotoana fohy avy eo (10-60 minitra)."" (Sleep paralysis is an episode of spiritual expulsion that occurs during your normal sleep time and when you return to your body for a short time afterwards (10-60 minutes).)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mety miankina amin’ny biôritma izy io** (It may depend on the biorhythm): While sleep paralysis *can* be linked to biorhythms, the passage doesn't emphasize this. The core description is its occurrence during sleep.
* **B: Ny tsy hifohazanao tanteraka no tanjona** (The goal is to not wake up completely):  The passage says the goal isn't *complete* wakefulness, but to break free from the paralysis.
* **D: Aorian'ny fifohazana, ny hatory indray ao anatin'ny adiny roa no tanjona** (After waking up, the goal is to sleep again within two hours): The passage describes the episode occurring *during* sleep, not after waking up and trying to return to sleep.

"Rehefa mitady ho zavatra mazava tsara no nofisin’ny atidoha matetika kokoa, inona no mitombo?","The correct answer is **D: Fotoana eo anelanelan'ny toetra fihetsehan’ny maso haingana (REM)**.

Here's why:

The text explains that lucid dreaming (being aware you're dreaming) is linked to increased time spent in REM sleep.  It also states that if REM sleep decreases, lucid dreaming becomes less frequent.  Therefore, to have more vivid and frequent lucid dreams (which the question links to more frequent ""brain jogging""), you need more time spent in REM sleep.  The text explicitly mentions that lucid dreaming happens when the ""fotoana eo anelanelan'ireo toetra REM"" (time between REM cycles) is extended.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ny fitomboan’ny toetra fihetsehan’ny maso haingana (REM) (Increase in Rapid Eye Movement cycles):** While REM is important, the text doesn't say the frequency of REM *cycles* increases. It's the *time spent* in REM that matters.
*   **B: Ny ambaratongan’ny angovo (Energy surplus):** The text doesn't mention energy levels directly.
*   **C: Ny faharetan’ny toetra fanarenana (Length of restorative cycles):**  The text talks about REM sleep and dreaming, not general restorative cycles."
Iza amin'ireto vokany ratsy ireto no mety hisy fiantraikany amin’ny vatana rehefa manofy matetika momba ny zava-miseho mazava tsara?,"The correct answer is **B: Mihena ny fihetsehan’ny maso haingana isan'alina**.

Here's why:

The text states that lucid dreaming occurs when REM sleep cycles are prolonged. If REM sleep is reduced, the body's ability to experience vivid dreams and feel engaged in them diminishes.  This is directly related to a decrease in REM sleep.  REM sleep is characterized by rapid eye movement (hence the name).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mihena ny halavan'ny fotoana eo anelanelan'ny toetra fihetsehan’ny maso haingana:** The text says the *duration* of REM is affected.  This option focuses on the *time between* eye movements, which is not the primary concern.
* **C: Tsy mety raha tsy manofy zavatra mazava tsara:** The text implies that lucid dreaming is the problem, not necessarily just vivid dreams.
* **D: Mitombo ny fihetsehan’ny maso haingana isan'alina:** This is the opposite of what the text describes. A decrease in REM leads to a decrease in eye movement.

"Araka ny andalana, ahoana no itovizan'ny ekipa amin’ny endriny mahazatra sy ny ekipa virtoaly?","The correct answer is **B: Samy manana ny ambaratongan’ny fahaleovantenany ny ekipa roa tonta amin'ny fiainany andavanandro.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that virtual teams often have more autonomy than traditional teams because of differing work schedules. 
* It also mentions the concept of an ""invisible team"" that holds all members accountable. This suggests a level of independence and self-direction, which is present in both traditional and virtual teams, but highlighted as more pronounced in virtual teams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Antenaina hiasa amin’ny sehatra mitovy ny ekipa roa tonta** (Both teams are expected to work in the same environment) - The passage highlights the *difference* in work environments (different schedules) between traditional and virtual teams.
* **C: Samy manao tatitra amina ekipa mpitantana tsy hita maso ny ekipa roa tonta** (Both teams report to an invisible management team) - While virtual teams *do* have an invisible team, the passage doesn't state that traditional teams do as well. This is a key distinction.
* **D: Samy miasa ao amin'ny faritra mitovy ora ny ekipa roa tonta** (Both teams work in the same time zone) -  The passage specifically notes that differing schedules are a reason for greater autonomy in virtual teams, meaning they *don't* necessarily work in the same time zone.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no fanambarana tsy marina momba ny ekipa miatrika mivantana sy virtoaly?","The correct answer is **C: Tsy dia manana fizakan-tena loatra mihoatra noho ny ekipa virtoaly ny ekipa amin’ny endriny mahazatra.**

Here's why:

* The text states that virtual teams often have *more* autonomy than traditional teams because their schedules can differ, and there's the concept of an ""invisible team"" that sets the standards. This implies traditional teams are *not* inherently more independent or self-directed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matetika amin'ny fenitra ambony kokoa no ametrahana ny ekipa amin’ny endriny mahazatra** - The text doesn't explicitly say traditional teams are always set higher standards. It focuses on the autonomy of virtual teams.
* **B: Matetika no toerana hifandraisan'ny ekipa amin’ny endriny mahazatra ny ekipa virtoaly** - The text states that virtual teams often *use* traditional teams for communication (inter-team communication), not that traditional teams are a common place for virtual teams to connect.
* **D: Mety hahasoa ny ekipa virtoaly ny fahasamihafan’ny oran’ny faritra** - The text mentions that a team 'invisible' will receive reports from all of the team members, which can be beneficial to virtual teams. But the text does not say that virtual teams can benefit from the difference of time zones.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ifantohan'ny votoatin’ny teoria?,"The correct answer is **A: Mitranga rehefa lehibe ny faniriana vaovao**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on understanding *why* people act the way they do, particularly driven by underlying needs and desires. Options B, C, and D all directly align with this focus:

*   **B: Ahoana ny fomba fiantraikan'ny tontolo iainan’ny olona iray amin’ny zavatra ataony:**  The passage states the theories consider how the environment affects behavior.
*   **C: Filana tanana anaty:** The passage explicitly mentions that the theories deal with needs and desires that people carry with them as they become adults.
*   **D: Fahatakarana ny tian'ny olona:** The core of the theories is to understand what motivates people and what drives their actions.

Option A, **Mitranga rehefa lehibe ny faniriana vaovao**, is not explicitly mentioned or a central theme. The passage is about enduring needs and desires, not specifically the emergence of new ones. Therefore, it's the best answer to the question of what the theory *doesn't* focus on.



"
Iza amin'ireto no tsy anisan'ny fitsipika momba ny ampahatelony?,"The correct answer is **B: Mamorona aina sy angovo ao anaty sary**.

Here's why:

The prompt states the third rule is about a *simple guideline to give life but maintain the grid pattern within the image*. It specifically focuses on the **grid pattern** (lines dividing the image) and using that to find a good spot for the main subject.

* **A: Mamorona fototra iaingana amin'ny toerana mety hametrahana ilay objectifs** (Creates a solid base for placing the objective): This aligns with the description of using the grid to find a good spot.
* **C: Mitana ny objectifs anaty toerana voafaritra tsara sy mahomby** (Positions the objective in a well-defined and effective place):  This is the direct result of following the grid guideline.
* **D: Mametraka lamina ao anaty sary** (Places a pattern within the image): This directly relates to the ""maintain the grid pattern"" aspect of the rule.

Option B, ""Mamorona aina sy angovo ao anaty sary"" (Creates life and energy within the image), is a general principle of composition, but **not specifically mentioned as the defining characteristic of the third rule** in this context. The rule is specifically tied to the grid structure.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra ny endriky ny sary 35mm?,"The correct answer is **C: Manana lafin-javatra hafa noho ny endrika sary mahazatra maro izy io** (It has different proportions than most standard image formats).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that 35mm film has a 3:2 aspect ratio.**  This is a key characteristic.
* **Options A, B, and D are all true according to the passage:**
    * **A: Mbola eo am-pamokarana azy** (It is still being produced):  The text mentions it's still manufactured.
    * **B: Ny endrika fakantsary nomerika no nampiasa azy** (Digital camera formats use it): The text says digital camera formats have adopted it.
    * **D: Io no endrika sary mahazatra indrindra eran-tany** (It is the most common image format worldwide): The passage states it is the most common.
* **Option C directly contradicts the 3:2 aspect ratio.**  The passage emphasizes this proportion as a defining characteristic. Any format significantly deviating from 3:2 is considered having ""different proportions"".



Therefore, Option C is the only one that doesn't align with the information presented in the text.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, rehefa mampitombo ny kalitaon'ny famokarana masom-pakantsary ireo mpanamboatra, ahoana no nanatsarana ny masom-pakantsary misy zoom?","The correct answer is **C: Ny kalitaon'ny sarin'izy ireo dia mitovitovy amin’ny fakantsary tsy misy zoom.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Namela ny vera fanalehibiazana hamokatra sary tsara kalitao azo ampitahaina amin’ireo vitan’ny vera manana halavanà fifantohana tsy miova izany.""  This directly translates to ""The zoom lens allows for the production of images of good quality comparable to those of lenses with a fixed focal length.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Manana hafainganam-pandehanà fakantsary ambony kokoa izy ireo** - The passage says the speed is *lower*, not higher.
* **B: Mora kokoa ny mampiasa azy ireo amin'ny toerana maizimaizina** - The passage states they are *difficult* to use in low-light situations without additional lighting.
* **D: Tsy dia be pitsiny loatra izy ireo mihoatra ny fakantsary tsy misy zoom** - The passage focuses on the image quality being comparable, not whether they are ""not too small.""



"
"Araka ny fampahalalana ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, rehefa oviana ny masom-pakantsary misy zoom no tsara kokoa noho ny masom-pakantsary tsy misy zoom?","The correct answer is **A: Raha laharam-pahamehana ny fisokafana farak’izay lehibe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lafiratsin’ny fampiasana ny masolavitry ny fakantsary ihany koa dia ny fara-fisokafany (ny hafainganany) izay ambany amin’ny ankapobeny. Mahatonga ny vera manalehibe mora vidy ho sarotra ampiasaka amin’ny toerana manana hazavana ambany izany rehefa tsy misy jiro fanampiny.""

This implies that zoom lenses (which have a longer focal length) generally have a lower aperture (smaller f-number) than prime lenses. A lower aperture means less light is let in, making them harder to use in low-light conditions.  Therefore, if you prioritize a large aperture (for low-light situations), a prime lens would be better.  Conversely, if you prioritize a long focal length (zoom), you are accepting the trade-off of a smaller aperture.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Raha kely ihany ny singanà fakantsary ilainao:**  This isn't directly related to the difference between zoom and prime lenses.
*   **C: Raha tsy te hampiasa tselatra amin'ny toerana maizina kokoa ianao:** While zoom lenses offer versatility, the passage doesn't mention using a tripod specifically. 
*   **D: Raha mitady fakantsary be pitsiny ianao:** Again, this isn't directly linked to the zoom vs. prime lens comparison.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ho raisina ho famaritana marina momba ny Zava-miafina?,"The correct answer is **A: Misy ny fanamafisana fa miaina fahatsiarovan-tena milamina sy sambatra** (There is an emphasis on experiencing peace and happiness).

Here's why:

* **The definition of Mysticism emphasizes a direct, personal experience of the divine or the ultimate reality.** While peace and happiness *can* be a result of such an experience, the core of mysticism isn't simply about *feeling* peaceful and happy. It's about actively seeking and having a direct connection with the divine.  A focus solely on peacefulness and happiness misses the active seeking and the profound connection described in the definition.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate descriptions of Mysticism:

* **B: Mitady fahatsiarovan-tena amin'ny fahamarinana ara-panahy ny mpanaraka ny Zava-miafina** (Mystics seek self-realization through spiritual truth) - This aligns perfectly with the definition of seeking a deeper understanding of the divine.
* **C: Ny mpanaraka ny Zava-miafina dia mety hanaraka fomba fanao izay hanampy azy ireo handalina ny fahatakarany momba ny zava-misy masina** (Mystics may follow practices that help them explore their understanding of the sacred) - Mysticism often involves practices like meditation, contemplation, or rituals to facilitate the connection with the divine.
* **D: Ny fanamafisana ny fikatsahana traikefa manokana mivantana dia azo ampitahaina amin'ny endrika finoana ara-fomba pivavahana sy fanompoana maro hafa** (The emphasis on seeking a direct personal experience can be compared to other forms of religious faith and worship) - Mystical experiences share similarities with religious experiences in terms of seeking a connection to something greater than oneself.



Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't accurately represent the core characteristics of Mysticism as defined in the text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy teboka ifantohan’ny Mysticisme?","The correct answer is **B: Mikatsaka hevi-baovao amin'ny alalan'ny traikefa zaraina, iombonana.**

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the mystic's direct, personal experience of the divine.** It explicitly states they seek a ""direct, visceral, or experiential encounter"" with the divine.
* **Option B describes seeking ""new experiences through shared, communal experience.""** This directly contradicts the mystic's focus on individual, internal experience. Mysticism is characterized by *solitary* contemplation and personal revelation.
* **Options A, C, and D align with the mystic's characteristics:**
    * **A:** ""Seeking a visceral encounter with the sacred"" is a core element of mysticism.
    * **C:** ""Affirming a sense of ecstatic self-sufficiency"" fits the mystic's independent spiritual standing.
    * **D:** ""Seeking self-sufficiency that feels divine"" directly relates to their quest for a personal connection with the divine.



Therefore, option B is the one that is *not* in line with the description of mysticism provided in the text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no mety nanomboka fiarahamonina ara-pambolena iray?","The correct answer is **A: Moriori avy any Nouvelle-Zélande**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Misy porofo vaovao milaza fa ny Moriori dia vondron’ny Maori an-tanibe avy any Nouvelle-Zélande nifindra tao amin’ireo nosy Chatham, nampivoatra ny kolontsainy miavaka sy milamina.""  This translates to: ""There is new evidence that the Moriori were a tribal group of Maori from New Zealand who migrated to the Chatham Islands, developing their own distinct and peaceful culture.""

The text implies the Moriori were Maori *from* New Zealand, not those who originated in Polynesia or were a separate group altogether. While there were Maori on the Chatham Islands, the key point is the Moriori's origin in New Zealand. Therefore, option A is the most accurate.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, mponina voalohany tao amin'ny toerana aiza ilay vondrona nihaza moa?","The correct answer is **B: Nouvelle-Zélande**.

The text states: ""Fotoana ela nandritra ny taonjato fahasivy ambin’ny folo sy roapolo dia noheverina fa ny Maoris no mponina voalohany tao Novely Zelandy..."" which translates to ""Long ago, during the 19th century, it was believed that the Maori were the first inhabitants of New Zealand...""

Rehefa inona ny fampiasana ny fomba Pureland origami no hahasoa ny mpamalona taratasy?,"The correct answer is **A: Aleon'ny mpamalona taratasy manao famalomana indray mandeha**.

Here's why:

* The definition of Pureland origami states that it's designed for *single folds only*.
* The question asks when it's beneficial.
* Therefore, the primary benefit is for paper folders who want to create origami with a single fold.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B:** The design is *for* those with limited mobility, not necessarily those with advanced skills.
* **C:** Pureland origami *cannot* be used to create folding models with turning folds.
* **D:** The design is specifically *for* single folds, so it's not about testing multiple folds.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra tsara ny Pureland origami?,"The correct answer is **A: Natao ho an'ny mpamalona taratasy efa za-draharaha izany (Intended for experienced paper folders)**.

Here's why:

* **The description states the Pureland origami was designed to help beginners and those with limited mobility.** Option A directly contradicts this.

The other options accurately reflect the characteristics of Pureland origami as described in the prompt:

* **B: Tsy ahitana famalomana mivadika mivalona ilay fomba (It doesn't involve turning folds):** The prompt explicitly says this is a key constraint.
* **C: Tokony hahitsy tsara ny toeran’ny valona (The folds must lie flat):** This is also a defining characteristic of the Pureland design.
* **D: Fomba tsara ho an'ny mpamalona taratasy manana talenta voafetra (A good method for paper folders with limited talent):** This aligns perfectly with the intended purpose described in the prompt.



Therefore, only option A is incorrect based on the provided information."

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Indus Valley Civilization is located in the area encompassing modern-day Pakistan, parts of northwestern India, and **northwestern Afghanistan**.  Option C says ""the entire area in northwestern Afghanistan,"" which *is* mentioned as part of the civilization's territory in the text.

The other options are all mentioned as being related to the Indus Valley Civilization:

* **Harappa:**  The name ""Harappan"" comes from the Harappa site, and the text mentions Harappa as a location where the civilization was first excavated.
* **Ny Reniranon'i Sarasvati:** The text suggests that the civilization might be linked to the Sarasvati River, even though it's now dried up.
* **Ny ankamaroan'ny Pakistan ankehitriny:** The text explicitly states that a large part of modern-day Pakistan is part of the civilization's territory.

Here's why:

* **Ny Sivilizasiona Harappan** is explicitly mentioned in the text as a name derived from Harappa.
* **Ny Sivilizasiona Indus-Sarasvati** is mentioned as an alternative name suggested by some researchers due to the existence of the Sarasvati River civilization.
* **Ny Sivilizasiona Renirano Indus Sarasvati** is also mentioned as a potential name, encompassing both rivers.
* **Ny Sivilizasiona Lohasaha Indus** is not mentioned anywhere in the provided text. While ""Lohasahan'ny Indoa"" (Indus Valley Civilization) is used as a descriptive term, ""Lohasaha Indus"" is not a specific name for the civilization discussed.

Therefore, option D is the only one not mentioned in the text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no miteraka tombontsoa maharitra?","The correct answer is **A: Ny fiaraha-miasa amin'ny hafa (Collaborating with others)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ny safidy tsara indrindra afaka ataony maharitra dia ny miara-miasa amin’ny hafa"" which translates to ""the best option to take for the long term is to work with others.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ny fanaovana laharam-pahamehana ny tombontsoan'ny tena (Prioritizing one's own benefit):** The passage describes self-interest as leading to short-term gains, not long-term benefits.
* **C: Ny fifantohana amin’ny mahasoa ny vitsy an'isa mihoatra ny maro an'isa (Focusing on helping a few more than many):** While helping others can be good, the passage contrasts this with the long-term benefits of collaboration.
* **D: Ny fahatakarana fa mety mahasoa ny fitsiriritana (Recognizing that indulgence might be beneficial):**  The passage is about strategic action, not about the benefits of indulgence.

The passage explicitly states: ""rehefa mahazo tombony ny maro dia mbola hisy foana ny tombony misimisy kokoa azo amin’ny fotoana fohy amin’ny fanaovana fihetsika **feno fitiavan-tena**."" (when many gain benefits, there will always be greater benefits that can be achieved in a short time by doing actions **full of selfishness**).

Therefore, the passage says that focusing on selfishness is what people would do if maximizing their own benefits is the priority.

"
Vanim-potoana inona no tonga taorian'ny vanim-potoan’ny Templars?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny Faramparan'ny Vanim-potoana Antenantenany** (Late Middle Ages).

The passage states that the Haut Moyen Âge (High Middle Ages) is followed by the Moyen Âge tardif (Late Middle Ages), which is generally accepted to end around the year 1500.  The Late Middle Ages is often referred to as the final period of the Middle Ages.

Fitsaboana na fomba ara-pitsaboana inona no tsy voalaza fa nampiasain’ny dokotera sy mpandidy nandritra ny Fanjakana Romana?,"The correct answer is **A: Fitsaboana ny fikorontanan'ny rarin-tsaina aorian'ny ratra-po amin'ny fanafody fampitoniana isankarazany.**

Here's why:

* The passage mentions the use of morphine and scopolamine, both derived from plants.  It also details surgical procedures like cutting to drain abscesses and to stop bleeding.
* However, there is no mention of treating mental disorders after a stroke with various stimulating remedies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fampiasana voan-javamaniry ho an'ny scopolamine:** The passage *does* mention scopolamine derived from the *jusqueiame noire* plant.
* **C: Fampihenana ny fikorianan'ny rà amin'ny painsa fampiasa amin’ny lalan-drà:** The passage *does* mention using cutting to drain abscesses and to stop bleeding as a way to reduce blood flow.
* **D: Fanapahana rantsam-batana ho an'ny marary manana sela maty:**  While the passage mentions cutting to drain abscesses, it does *not* mention cutting limbs for necrotic tissue.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions the following advancements in Roman medicine:
    * **The employment of doctors by Emperor Augustus.**
    * **The creation of the first Roman Medical Corps to treat war-related injuries.**
    * **The use of medicinal substances like morphine and scopாலும்.**
    * **Surgical techniques for wound closure and bloodletting.**

* Options A, B, and D are all directly linked to these advancements.  The Medical Corps (A) is the core of the military medical response.  Emperor Augustus's policy (B) enabled the employment of doctors. And employing doctors (D) is a direct action contributing to medical progress.

* **Teaching hospitals** are not mentioned in the text. While they eventually became important in medical history, the passage focuses on the *early* advancements of the Roman era. Therefore, the creation of teaching hospitals is the one that is *not* related to the advancements described in the text.



"
Miankina amin'ny inona ny fahafahana mijery?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny retsi-pandrenesana amin’ny rafi-maso** (The refraction of light in the eye).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ny ny fahitana, na ny fahafahana mahita dia miankina amin’ireo taova fitsapana anatin’ny rafi-pijerena na ny maso.""  This translates to ""Sight, or the ability to see, depends on the refracting tissues within the eye.""

While the passage mentions other aspects of the eye (like the different types and capabilities), it directly links the ability to see to the refraction of light within the eye's structures.  Options B, C, and D are related but less direct answers based on the provided text.
"
Miankina amin'ny inona ny fiovaovan'ny firafitry ny maso eo amin'ny organisma?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny fepetra takian'ny organisma (The needs of the organism)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the structure of eyes varies depending on the *filan’ny taova* (the needs of the organism/the requirements of the task).  It specifically mentions that different eye structures have different capabilities, respond to different types of light, have different sensitivity, and require different processing power.  This all points to the fact that the eye's structure adapts to fulfill the organism's specific visual needs.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ny fahatsapana ny onjam-pahazavana (The detection of light waves)**: While light detection is fundamental to vision, the passage emphasizes that the *structure* of the eye *adapts* based on the needs, not just the basic ability to detect light.
*   **C: Ny ambaratongam-pahatsapana (Sensitivity)**: Sensitivity is *part* of the eye's structure, but the passage states that the structure adapts to different sensitivities, implying sensitivity is a consequence of the overall need.
*   **D: Ny fahasarotan'ny organisma (The complexity of the organism)**: While complexity might play a role, the passage directly ties the changes in eye structure to the specific requirements of the organism's task.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona ny fanambarana momba ny Sikhisma tsy mampiseho mazava an’ilay fivavahana?","The correct answer is **A: Vokatry ny fisaratsarahana sekta tao anatin'ny fomban-drazana Hindoa ny Sikhisma**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Sikhism is a religion ""separate from Hindu customs."" Option A implies it's *caused* by sectarianism within Hinduism, which isn't directly supported by the text. The text only states it's *different*.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the passage:

* **B: Ny guru no lafiny fototra tokana amin'ny Sikhisma** - The passage highlights the importance of the Guru in Sikhism, even though the role of the Guru is unique to Sikh faith.
* **C: Gurus sivy no nanaraka ny mpanorina ny fivavahana, Guru Nanak** - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **D: Miorim-paka amin'ny Hindoisma ny fomban-drazana Sikhisma sasany** - The passage states that ""the customs of Indiana"" are important to the Guru, implying Sikhism shares some customs with Hinduism.



Therefore, option A is the statement that is *not* clearly presented in the passage."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no heverina ho lafiny fototry ny rafi-pinoana Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Ny fotokevitra guru (The teachings of the Gurus)**.

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Gurmat no iantsoan’ny Sikhs ny fivavahany, izay midika hoe “fomban’ny mpitarika” amin’ny teny Punjabi.""  This directly links the teachings of the Gurus (Gurmat) as the core of Sikhism.
* While the text acknowledges Sikhism's roots in Hinduism and that Sikhs accept some Hindu principles, it emphasizes that Sikhism is distinct and has its own unique foundation.
* Option B is incorrect because Sikhism is explicitly described as separate from Hindu practices.
* Option C is incorrect because the text doesn't mention rejecting other Indian religions, but rather having a distinct path.
* Option D (speaking Punjabi) is a cultural aspect, not a core theological principle.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, amin’ny inona no mety hitranga ny fahasarotana ho an’ny ankizy manana Olan’ny Tsy Fahampian’ny Fifantohan-tsaina?","The correct answer is **A: Enti-mody**.

The text states that children with ADD often have trouble with **impulsive behavior**, getting into fights, and arguing with authority figures because their brains don't work normally with typical tasks. This impulsive behavior can lead to them being perceived as difficult or naughty.

While the text mentions they can focus on things they enjoy like playing, watching videos, or writing, the primary difficulty mentioned is related to **impulsivity**.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, nahoana ny ankizy manana Olan’ny Tsy Fahampian’ny Fifantohan-tsaina no manao fihetsika sahisahy?","The correct answer is **D: Mba hanairana ny atidohany**.

The text states: ""Sahirana ny ankizy voan’ny ADD voa mahavitra mifantoka any an-tsekoly, fa afaka mifantoka izy amin’ny zavatra tiany atao toy ny milalao, mijery sary miaina, na manoratra lahatsoratra tsy misy mari-piatoana.  **Mazàna no manana olana foana ireto ankizy ireto, satria ” manao fihetsika mampidi-doza azy ireo, miditra anaty ady, miantsy ady amin’ny manampahefana “ mba hampiasana ny atidohany, satria tsy mety miasa amin’ny zavatra mahazatra intsony ny atidohany.**""

This clearly indicates that they act out to stimulate their brains because their brains don't work normally with typical tasks. Therefore, they are trying to force their brains to work in a different way.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mba hampihenana ny fipelipelehana** - The text doesn't connect acting out to reducing boredom.
*   **B: Mba hanampiana azy ireo hifandray amin'ny namany** - The text states acting out *hinders* social connection.
*   **C: Mba hanairana ny ray aman-dreniny** - There is no mention of this in the text."
"Araka ny fanazavana ao amin'ny andalana, iza amin'ireo no tsy ohatra amin’ny esafôdazy?","Ny valintsoa sy araka ny andalana dia **A: Ny torolalana raha vao manomboka ny lalao ordinatera**.

Ny esafôdazy, araka ny andalana, dia mety ho virtoaly na tena izy, ary ny mpampianatra koa dia mety ho esafôdazy. Ny tuteur SAT, fandaharam-pianarana manokana ary mpanazatranà ligy madinika dia mety ho karazana esafôdazy (na mety ho fomba ho an'ny mpampianatra hanaovana esafôdazy).
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra tsara ny foto-kevitry ny esafôdazy?,"The correct answer is **C: Fantatra koa ho toy ny fianarana amin’ny alalan’ny tetikasa izy.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that a learning ""scaffolding"" isn't a *method of learning* itself, but rather *support* for learning. 
* While scaffolding can *be used* in project-based learning, the passage doesn't characterize it *as* project-based learning.  It's a support *for* project-based learning, or other new learning approaches.
* The other options accurately reflect the passage's description of scaffolding:
    * **A: Misy amin’ny tontolo virtoaly ny esafôdazy** - The passage mentions both virtual and real-world scaffolding.
    * **B: Fanampiana no ilazana azy kokoa fa tsy fomba fianarana** -  This is a direct quote from the passage.
    * **D: Ny esafôdazy dia ampiasaina hanohanana amin'ny fanombohan'ny traikefam-pianarana** - The passage explicitly states scaffolding helps with navigating potentially difficult parts of a learning path.



Therefore, option C incorrectly equates scaffolding with project-based learning, which isn't the accurate portrayal given in the text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, fiasa MySpace inona no mety hahasoa an’ireo mpianatra manana olana amin'ny vakiteny?","The correct answer is **C: Adiresinà tranonkala (Website address)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Azo idirana mora foana io pejy io amin'ny alalan'ny fanomezana adiresy tranonkala iray monja, izany dia manamora ny fitadidiana sy ny fanoratana azy ho an’ireo mpianatra izay mety hanana fahasahiranana amin’ny fampiasana kitendry na amin'ny fanononan-teny."" (The page can be accessed easily by providing just one website address, which makes it easier to remember and type for students who may have difficulty with usernames or typing.)

This directly addresses the difficulty some students might have with typing or remembering usernames. The website address simplifies this process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Personnalisation (Personalisation):** While personalisation is a feature, the text doesn't link it specifically to helping students with reading difficulties.
*   **B: Bilaogy (Blogs):** Blogs are a feature, but the text doesn't connect them to aiding students who struggle with reading.
*   **D: Kaonty 54 tapitrisa (54 million accounts):** The number of accounts is irrelevant to a student's reading difficulties.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza tamin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy anisan'ny valintenin'i Krushchev nandritra ny rotaky ny mpiasa?","The correct answer is **C: Ahenao hatrany ny karama (Continue to cut salaries)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Krushchev *did* agree to some economic demands and to appoint Wladyslaw Gomulka, who was popular. The passage also mentions he sent tanks to restore order.  Therefore, he wouldn't have agreed to *continue* cutting salaries, as that would have been a direct cause of the workers' protests. The other options are all things he *did* do:

*   **A: Tendreo ny praiminisitra vaovao (Approve the new prime minister):**  The passage explicitly states he agreed to appoint Gomulka.
*   **B: Ampiasao ny tanky hamerenana ny filaminana (Use tanks to restore order):** The passage says he sent tanks to restore order.
*   **D: Ankatoavy ny fitakiana momba ny toekarena sasany (Agree to some economic demands):**  The passage states he agreed to some economic demands.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy antony nahatonga ny korontana tany Polonina?,"The correct answer is **D: Fanendrena an'i Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the *unlikely* cause of the unrest.** The passage states the unrest was due to a lack of food and wages, and worker protests against the communist system.
* **Gomulka's appointment is presented as a *response* to the unrest, not a cause.**  Krushchev appointed him to appease the workers and restore order. The workers were protesting *against* the communist system, and Gomulka was seen as a compromise figure, not the origin of the problem.
* **Communism, the lack of food, and the cut in wages *were* the causes** as directly stated in the passage.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy nisy fiantraikany tamin'ny fifandraisan’i URSS sy i Etazonia?","The correct answer is **A: Ny fahasamihafana ara-kolontsaina (Cultural differences)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the collapse of the German system, its operation, and culture led to the fall of the nation. It further says that former allies (USSR and USA) turned against each other and started the Cold War.  The Cold War was characterized by geopolitical tensions and conflicts around the world.

* **B: Fijery momba an'i Alemaina (Views on Germany)** - The text mentions Germany's collapse as a catalyst for the Cold War, so views on Germany were definitely a factor.
* **C: Dingana mifanohitra (Conflicting steps/actions)** - The text describes the shift from alliance to conflict and the subsequent Cold War, which involves conflicting actions.
* **D: Fifandirana mikasika ny rafitra (Disagreements about the system)** - The text states that disagreements about the system (likely referring to political and economic systems) were a factor in the Cold War's origins.

* **A: Ny fahasamihafana ara-kolontsaina (Cultural differences)** - While cultural differences *could* contribute to tensions between countries, the text focuses on the *political* and *systemic* factors as the primary drivers of the Cold War. Cultural differences aren't specifically mentioned as directly impacting the relationship between the USSR and the USA *after* the initial period discussed.

Therefore, cultural differences are the least directly linked to the described sequence of events.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra tsara ny tanjon'ny fanairana hozatra fitatitra manerana ny vatana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny tsy fikorianan'ny ra tsara (The proper circulation of blood)**.

Here's why:

* **The question describes the function of the nervous system in regulating blood flow.**  The key point is maintaining stable blood flow.
* **Option B: Ny fitantanana ny fikorianan'ny ra (Managing blood circulation)** - This is a correct statement; the nervous system *does* manage blood circulation.
* **Option C: Ny fihazonana ny homéostasie (Maintaining homeostasis)** - This is also correct; regulating blood flow is crucial for overall bodily homeostasis.
* **Option D: Ny fisorohana ny loza mety hitranga amin’ny vatana (Preventing potential threats to the body)** - This is a correct statement; the nervous system can trigger responses to protect the body, including regulating blood flow to areas in need.
* **Option A: Ny tsy fikorianan'ny ra tsara (The proper circulation of blood)** - While proper blood circulation *is* a result of the nervous system's actions, it's not the *goal* of sending signals through the nervous system. The goal is to *regulate* blood flow to maintain homeostasis, respond to threats, etc.  The nervous system's actions *lead to* proper circulation, but stating ""the proper circulation of blood"" as the main goal is incomplete.

Therefore, option A is the one that *least* accurately summarizes the purpose of nervous system signals traveling throughout the body.



"
Inona no hita ao amin'ny Plateau de Gizeh?,"The correct answer is **C: Ireo zava-mahatalanjona fito rehetra**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ny Lemak’i Giza, na koa hoe “Tanànam-patin’i Giza” ao amin’ny Lohasahin’ny Maty Egiptianina dia mirakitra piramida maromaro (ka ny piramida lehibe no piramida mivelatra indrindra amin’ireo), fasana kely maromaro, tempoly maromaro ary ny Sphinx lehibe.""

This means the Giza Plateau *contains* all seven wonders of the ancient world (though only the Great Pyramid remains standing). While the other options are elements found on the plateau, option C is the most comprehensive and accurate description of *everything* present.
"
Inona no tanjon'ny Piramida Lehibe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny mba hanomezam-boninahitra an'i Farao**.

The text states: ""Ny piramida lehibe dia natao hanomezam-boninahitra an’i Farao Khufu..."" which translates to ""The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...""
"
Iza no tompon’andraikitra amin’ny fahafantarantsika ilay mpandoro zavatr’olona izay nanimba ny tempoly?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ny mpahay tantara Grika Strado dia nanamarika ny anarana taty aoriana, izay fantatsika ankehitriny.""  This translates to ""The Greek historian Strabo recorded the name in a later work, which we know today.""  Therefore, Strabo is responsible for the fact that we know the name of the arsonist, Herostratus.
"
Inona no fanambarana marina momba ny fanorenana indray ny tempolin’i Artemisy?,"The correct answer is **B: Taorian’ny fanjakan’i Alexandre Ilay Ngezalahy no nanorenana azy indray.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Alexander, as a king, was willing to pay the money to rebuild the temple, but his offering was refused. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.""

Therefore, Alexander the Great initiated the rebuilding after his death, and the rebuilding occurred after his reign.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I Alexandre Lehibe no nandoa ny volan’ny fanorenana indray:** While Alexander *intended* to pay, his offering was refused. He didn't actually provide the funds.
* **C: Nomena baiko i Herostratus mba handoa ny sarany lany tamin'ny fanamboarana:** Herostratus was infamous for *destroying* the temple, not rebuilding it, and he was condemned to infamy, not rewarded.
* **D: Tamin’ny taona 320 T.K no nanorenana azy indray:** The passage explicitly states the rebuilding occurred in 323 BC, not 320 BC.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, oviana no fotoana talohaloha indrindra nisian’ny karazana mety ho nandeha tamin'ny tongotra roa?","The correct answer is **A: Fito tapitrisa taona lasa izay**.

The text states: ""na dia mety ho nandeha an-tongotra roa koa aza ny Sahelantropus taty aloha tahaka ny 7 tsitahisa taona."" (even Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs like 7 million years ago).
"
Iza tamin'ireto karazana ireto no nandeha tamin’ny tongotra roa?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo erectus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ny fitaterana fantatra voalohany dia ny dia tongotra, nanomboka nandeha tongotra niarina ny olombelona tamin’ny fiandohan’ny Homo Erectus..."" (The first known locomotion was walking on two legs, hominids began to walk on two legs with the beginning of Homo Erectus...)
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Ireo spesialista amin’ny fandehananan-tongon-droa dia hita any amin’ny sisa taolan’ny Australopithecus tamin’ny 4.2-3.9 tapitrisa taona lasa..."" (Bipeds are found in the remains of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago...)
* **The passage states:** ""...na dia mety ho nandeha an-tongotra roa koa aza ny Sahelantropus taty aloha tahaka ny 7 tsitahisa taona."" (...although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs earlier, around 7 million years ago.)

Therefore, **Homo erectus** is explicitly mentioned as the hominid that *began* to walk on two legs, and **Australopithecus** *may* have walked on two legs earlier. **Sahelanthropus** is only mentioned as a possibility of bipedalism much earlier.

**C: Bipèdes** is incorrect because it's a general term (bipeds) and not a specific hominid.

**D: Australopithèque** is incorrect because while they *may* have been bipeds, the passage highlights Homo erectus as the first known to consistently walk on two legs.



"
Inona no nokasain’ny tafika an-dranomasina Alemà atao nandritra ny Ady Lehibe Faharoa?,"The correct answer is **B: Nanakana an'i Grande-Bretagne tsy handray olona sy entana**.

Here's why:

The text states that the German navy (specifically, U-boats) tried to ""stop the movement"" across the North Atlantic.  This means they were trying to prevent supplies and people from reaching Britain. Option B accurately reflects this intent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nanakana entana avy any Grande-Bretagne:** The text indicates the Germans were *preventing* supplies from reaching Britain, not stealing them.
* **C: Nitatitra fitaovana manerana ny Atlantika:** This describes the American effort, not the German one.
* **D: Nanakana an'i Amerika tsy handray olona sy entana:** The focus was on Britain, not America.

"Araka ny fanazavana nomena tao amin’ny andalana, iza no tena nahomby tamin’ny ady an-dranomasina nandritra ny Fampielezan-kevitra tany Atlantika Avaratra?","The correct answer is **D: Ny Britanika**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the American effort to send men and equipment across the Atlantic to aid the British was an attempt to help the British. It also says the German U-boats were trying to stop this movement.  The passage implies that the British were the ones being supported and potentially saved by the American effort. The ultimate implication is that the British were successful in preventing Germany from potentially winning the war in the North Atlantic.
"
Inona no tsy mbola nisy rehefa nametraka ny fampiasana ny fitaingenan-tsoavaly ny Asyrianina?,"The correct answer is **A: Lasely**.

The passage states: ""Mbola tsy nisy ny lasely, ka niady ambonin’ny soavaly tsy misy lasely ny kavaleria Asyriana."" (There were no lances, so the Assyrian cavalry fought with lances without a shaft.)

Therefore, lances were not yet in use when the Assyrians introduced cavalry.
"
Ahoana no fomba fitrangan’ny ady rehefa mampiasa fitaingenan-tsoavaly?,"The correct answer is **C: Mitaingina soavaly (Charge with swords)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""The cavalry was a mounted fighting force. There were no lances, so the Assyrian cavalry fought with swords on their horses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: An-tongotra (On foot):** The text describes cavalry, which are mounted.
*   **B: Tsy misy fiadiana (No defense):** The text says the cavalry fought *with* swords, indicating they had a weapon for defense.
*   **D: Vitsy kokoa ny miaramila (Fewer soldiers):** The text doesn't discuss the number of soldiers, but rather the nature of the cavalry's fighting style.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, aiza no tsy hahitanao olom-pirenena Babyloniana salantsalany?","The correct answer is **D: Mitondra fanatitra ho any amin'ny fitoerana masina anatiny**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ny tempoly tsirairay dia nanana tokontany misokatra sy toerana masina anatiny izay ny mpisorona ihany no afaka miditra ao."" (Each temple had an open courtyard and a sacred inner sanctuary where only priests were allowed to enter.)
* **The question asks where you *wouldn't* find Babylonian people doing something described in the passage.**  Since only priests were allowed in the inner sanctuary, the general population would *not* be bringing offerings there.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Mitondra sorona eo an-tokotanin’ny tempoly:** The passage says people brought offerings (sorona) to the temples.
* **B: Manatrika lanonana ao amin'ny tempoly lehibe:** The passage mentions priests tried to answer the gods' needs through libations (lanonana) in the temples.
* **C: Any amin’ny fety eo-tokotanin’ny tempoly:**  The passage says offerings (sorona) were brought to the temples, implying rituals and festivals would have occurred.



Therefore, the only activity not described as being done by regular Babylonian people is bringing offerings to the inner sanctuary.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no natao manokana ho an'ny pretra?,"The correct answer is **B: Toerana masina anatiny**.

Here's why:

* **Toerana masina anatiny (Inner sanctuary):** The text explicitly states that only priests were allowed to enter the inner sanctuary of the temple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Fety (Feasts):** Feasts were offered *to* the gods, not specifically for the priests.
* **Lanonana (Sacrifices):** Sacrifices were offerings *to* the gods.
* **Ziggurats:** Ziggurats were temple structures, particularly the platform upon which the temple stood. They weren't specifically for priests.



Therefore, the inner sanctuary was the exclusive domain of the priests."
Oviana no nahazo laza ny Mpanjaka Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **C: Taorian'ny nahitana ny fasany**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ny fahitana ny fasany tamin’ny taona 1922 dia nahatonga azy ho olo-malaza."" (The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.) This directly answers the question of when he became well-known.
"
Inona no nahatonga ny Mpanjaka Tutankhamun ho mpanjaka Egyptiana malaza?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny fahitana ny fasany tsy nokitihana (The fact that his tomb was undisturbed)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Tutankhamun was not considered important in ancient times and wasn't recorded on lists of pharaohs.
* The discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922 is what brought him fame and made him so well-known today. The fact that the tomb wasn't robbed and the artifacts inside were preserved is the key reason for his fame.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ny momba azy ao anaty lisitry ny mpanjaka fahiny (His mention in lists of ancient pharaohs):** The passage says he *wasn't* on these lists in his own time.
* **C: Ny fandrobana ny sarivongana an'arivony tao amin'ny fasany (The looting of thousands of gold artifacts in his tomb):** The passage states the opposite - that the tomb was undisturbed and the artifacts were preserved.
* **D: Ny maha-zava-dehibe azy tamin’ny andron’ny Egyptiana fahiny (His importance to the ancient Egyptians):** The passage indicates he wasn't considered important *during* his lifetime.



"
Inona no tsy vitan’ilay poety Grika Homer?,"The correct answer is **A: Mihainoa** (To be blind).

The text states that Homer is famous for writing the Iliad and the Odyssey. It doesn't mention anything about him being blind. The other options are not directly addressed in the text.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
Iza no Grika malaza fantatra amin'ny zavatra hafa ankoatra ny literatiora?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagore**.

Here's why:

* **Homère** is famous for his epic poems, the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*.
* **Sophocle** and **Aristophane** are renowned playwrights.
* **Pythagore** is famous for the Pythagorean theorem in mathematics.

The question asks for the Greek known for something *other* than literature. While Sophocles and Aristophanes were literary figures, Pythagoras is specifically known for his mathematical contributions.
"
Taiza ny fianakaviana hebreo no nandany ny ankamaroan’ny fotoanany?,"The correct answer is **A: Teny an-kalamanjana**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ny ankamaroan’ny fiainan’ny fianakaviana Hebreo dia eny an-kalamanjana no mitranga."" This translates to ""The majority of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.""
"
Inona ho an’ny fianakaviana hebreo no tsy tena zava-dehibe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ny tranony (Their house)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Raha ny hafanana any Afovoany Atsinanana, tsy dia zava-dehibe loatra ilay trano."" (Given the heat in the East, the house isn't that important.)

Therefore, the house was not considered a very important thing for the Hebrew family in that region.
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy voalaza ho fahasamihafana eo amin’ny firenena Skandinaviana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny tany (The land)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions differences in:

* **Ny olona (The people):**  It states there are differences in the people of Greenland compared to the Scandinavian countries.
* **Ny fomba amam-panao (Customs/Ways of doing things):** It mentions differences in customs and ways of life.
* **Tantaran’I Danemark, Soeda sy Norvezy ary Islandy (The history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland):** It highlights differences in historical narratives.

While the geography of Greenland is different from the Scandinavian countries, the passage focuses on *cultural and historical* differences, not geographical ones. Therefore, the land itself isn't presented as a point of difference.



"
Iza no voalohany nanorim-ponenana tany Groenland?,"The correct answer is **A: Foko Eskimo**.

The text clearly states: ""Na dia “Skandinavianina” aza ny firenena tsirairay, dia maro ny fahasamihafana teo amin’ny vahoaka, mpanjaka, fomba fanao sy tantaran’I Danemark, Soeda sy Norvezy ary Islandy. **Na dia “Skandinavianina” aza ny firenena tsirairay, dia maro ny fahasamihafana teo amin’ny vahoaka, mpanjaka, fomba fanao sy tantaran’I Danemark, Soeda sy Norvezy ary Islandy.** Tsy miankina amin’ny fahitany, ny foko Eskimô dia efa nipetraka teo tamin’izany fotoana."" 

This translates to: ""Even though the country is ""Scandinavian"", there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland. **Even though the country is ""Scandinavian"", there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.  Independent of his sighting, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at that time.**""

Therefore, the Eskimo tribe was already inhabiting Greenland before any Norse settlers arrived.
"
Iza amin'ireto vondrona ireto no misafidy ny hisakafo tsy misy seza?,"The correct answer is **B: Lehilahy Romana mahantra**.

The passage states: "" ireo olona mahantra sy ilay vehivavy, ireo lehilahy manan-karena kosa dia tia nanao fiaraha-misakafo izay sady hialàny voly eo amin’ny misy azy no hisakafoanany."" 

Which translates to: ""the poor people and the woman, the rich men loved to eat away from the presence of what was theirs.""  Therefore, the poor men were the ones who ate without a chair.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy anisan'ny fety Romana Fahiny?,"The correct answer is **D: Lovia misy vorontsiloza natono (Roasted cocoa)**.

The text explicitly states that the Romans did not have cocoa, nor did they eat roasted cocoa. The other options are all mentioned as part of Roman feasts.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy angambaina hanana fiantraika maharitra?","The correct answer is **B: Kolontsaina vitsy an’isa (Minor cultures)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Kolontsainan’ny vitsy an’isa dia mazàna maty ary tsy mamela porofo ara-tantara mivaingana ka lasa tsy ekena ho sivilizasiôna tena izy."" (Minor cultures are often dead and do not allow verifiable historical evidence, becoming not accepted as a true civilization.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fiarahamonina (Communities)** - Communities are a fundamental building block of civilization and essential for its development.
* **C: Tanàna-fanjakana (City-states)** - City-states are often the leading forces in civilization and play a crucial role in its establishment.
* **D: Kolontsaina sivilizasiona (Civilizations)** - The entire text is *about* civilizations, and they are defined by their lasting cultural transmission and societal structure.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mialoha ny firenena?","The correct answer is **C: Tanàna-fanjakana**.

The text states: ""Ny tanàna fanjakana no mpialoha lalana ny firenena."" which translates to ""The city-state is the forerunner of the nation."" This means the city-state existed before the nation."
Inona amin’ny fanambarana momba ny The Drukgyal Dzong no tsy marina?,"The incorrect statement is **A: Ho fankalazana ny fandresen'ny tafika Tibetana-Mongolianina no nanorenana azy**

Here's why:

The text states that Drukgyal Dzong was built in commemoration of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian armies. It wasn't *to celebrate* the victory, but rather *as a memorial* to it.

The other statements are accurate according to the text:

* **B: Any Bhutan no misy azy:** The text explicitly states it's in the Paro district of Bhutan.
* **C: Ravan’ny afo ny maro tamin'ny relìkan’ny manda:** The text mentions that a fire in 1951 damaged many of the relics within the dzong.
* **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel no namorona azy:** The text states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel commissioned the construction of the dzong.

Therefore, option A is the only inaccurate statement.
"
Inona no fanambarana milaza mazava tsara ny zava-niseho vokatry ny afo tao Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny sarin'i Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel sisa no relìka sisa tavela**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Tamin’ny 1951, vitsy sisa ny vakoka tavela tao Drukgyal Dzong noho ny afo, anisan’izany ny sarin’i Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel."" (In 1951, only a few relics remained in Drukgyal Dzong due to the fire, including the painting of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.)

Option A directly reflects this information, stating that the painting of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was one of the few relics left after the fire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nandresy ny tafika Tibetana-Mongol:** While the Dzong was built to commemorate the victory over these troops, this option doesn't address the fire's aftermath.
* **C: Tsy niantraika tamin’ny lazan'ny fahalianana izany:** The text explicitly says the fire *did* cause damage.
* **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel no nitahiry azy:** The text says the painting *was* of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, not that he stored it.



"
Iza amin'ireto fanambarana manaraka momba an'i Kambodza ireto no marina?,"The correct answer is **D: Noravan'ny Thailandey i Phnom Phen**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Tamin’ny 1772 dia namotika an’i Phnom Phen izy ireo [ny Thais ireo]."" (In 1772, they [the Thais] destroyed Phnom Phen.)
* **Option D** directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nandrava an'i Phnom Phen ny Vietnamiana:** The text says the Thais destroyed Phnom Phen, not the Vietnamese.
* **B: Nanafika an'i Thailandy tamin'ny 1772 i Kambodza:** The text says the Thais attacked Cambodia in 1772, not the other way around.
* **C: Nanafika an’i Kambodza i Vietnam tamin’ny fiandohan’ny taonjato faha-18:** The text states the Thais attacked Cambodia in the late 18th century and the Vietnamese attacked in the late 18th century. It doesn't say they attacked in the early 18th century.

Therefore, **D** is the only accurate statement based on the provided text.
"
Iza amin'ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra mazava tsara mikasika ny fanafihana an'i Kambaojy?,"The best answer is **D: Notafihin’ny Thailandey imbetsaka i Kambaojy**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""I Kambodza dia tery tao anelanelana mpifanolobodirindrina roa matanjaka, Tailandy sy Vietnam. Nanafika an’i Kambodia imbetsaka ny Thais tamin’ny taon-jato faha18 ary tamin’ny 1772 dia namotika an’i Phnom Phen izy ireo."" This clearly indicates frequent attacks from Thailand during the 18th century.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

* **A: Notafihin’ny Vietnamianina imbetsaka i Kambaojy:** While the passage mentions Vietnamese attacks, it doesn't explicitly say they attacked *frequently* like the Thais did.
* **B: Notafihin’ny Thailandey sy Vietnamianina i Kambaojy tamin’ny 1772:** While technically true that both were involved, it's less specific than stating the Thais were the more frequent attackers.
* **C: Nandrava an'i Phnom Phen ny Vietnamianina:**  This is true, but only a single event.  It doesn't capture the overall pattern of attacks.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided passage."
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy nataon'ny Orinasa Holandey Atsinanan’i India nandritra ny fotoanan’izy ireo tany Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny famokarana masomboly aborizenina** (The production of aboriginal masomboly).

Here's why:

* The text states that the Dutch East India Company established a trading post and *used Chinese laborers* for working in the timber and mulberry fields. 
* The text also mentions that the Qing Dynasty took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan.
* The text clearly states that Japan took control of Taiwan after the First Sino-Japanese War.

The provided text *doesn't mention* the production of aboriginal masomboly. The other options *are* mentioned in the text: establishing a trading post, using Chinese laborers, and the Qing Dynasty taking control.



"
Inona no napetraky ny Fifanarahana Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny fahefan'i Japana manoloana an'i Taiwan**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Tamin’ny taona 1895, rehefa resy tamin’ny Ady voalohany teo amin’i Sina sy Japana (1894-1895) ny fanjakan’i Qing dia nanasonia ny Fifanarahan’i Shimonoseki, izay hanomezany ny fanapahana an’i Taiwan an’i Japana, izay manjaka eo amin’ny nosy hatramin’ny taona 1945.""  This directly translates to: ""In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which granted Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.""

Therefore, the Treaty of Shimonoseki resulted in Japan gaining control/sovereignty over Taiwan.
"
Ahoana no fomba fandrefesana ny pH amin'ny vokatra simika?,"The correct answer is **C: Ny habetsahan'ny iôna hidirôzenina ao amin'ny vokatra simika.**

Here's why:

* **pH is defined by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+).** The passage explicitly states this.  A higher concentration of H+ means a lower pH (more acidic), and a lower concentration means a higher pH (more alkaline/basic).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rehefa inona ny vokatra simika no bazika na asidra:** While acidity and alkalinity relate to pH, they aren't the *definition* of pH. pH is a numerical scale representing the concentration of H+.
* **B: Firy ny prôtôna hita ao amin'ny vokatra simika:**  The number of protons is related to the number of hydrogen ions, but pH specifically refers to the concentration of H+ ions, not the total number of protons.
* **D: Firy ny elektrôna ao amin'ny vokatra simika:** Electrons are irrelevant to the pH scale. pH measures the concentration of hydrogen ions.



"
Inona no nesorina tamin'ny iôna hidirôzenina?,"The correct answer is **D: Elektrôna**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""The hydrogen ion (H in pH) is a proton that has lost its electron.""

Therefore, the hydrogen ion *lost* an electron.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Prôtôna:** While a hydrogen ion *is* a proton, the question is asking what was *removed* from it.
*   **B: pH:** pH is a measure *of* the hydrogen ion concentration, not something removed from it.
*   **C: Alkalina:** Alkalinity is related to the presence of hydroxide ions (OH-), which is the opposite of hydrogen ions.

"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina tsara ny fireharehan’ny liona?,"The correct answer is **C: Mifankahazo avokoa ny lahy sy ny vavy** (Males and females are all harmonious).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""The pride is made up of one to three adult males, along with many females, up to thirty in a single group."" This indicates an imbalance, with more females than males.
* **The text also mentions:** ""The lions are reminiscent of a herd of buffalo or an elk, animals known for their similar social structure to lions (not other big cats) in terms of leadership, and are very fierce to their cubs.""  This suggests a hierarchy and potentially conflict.

Options A and D are supported by the text. Option B is also partially supported – while the text doesn’t state *exactly* the ratio, it clearly states there are multiple males and many females, implying they aren't equal. 

Therefore, option C directly contradicts the information provided in the text.



"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina tsara ny fihetsiky ny liona?,"The correct answer is **C: Na ny lahy na ny vavy dia samy tena mamono mahafaty rehefa miremby (Both males and females are equally ruthless when they kill prey)**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that only one or three adult males are in the pride, and the females are related and form a close-knit group. 
*   While the text says that lions are similar in behavior to wolves and alligators (and thus hunt cooperatively and are ruthless), it **doesn't specifically state that both males and females are equally ruthless when killing prey.** The focus on the male's role as the primary hunter implies a difference in the intensity of their hunting behavior.  It's a subtle distinction, but option C makes a stronger, less supported claim based on the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate:

*   **A: Tena mahay miara-monina izy ireo (They are very social):** The text explicitly states that lions live in prides.
*   **B: Sahala ny fihetsik’izy ireo sy ny amboadia (Their behavior is similar to wolves):** The text directly compares lions to wolves and alligators in terms of their social behavior and hunting strategies.
*   **D: Sahala amin'ny an’ny saka lehibe hafa ny fihetsik'izy ireo (Their behavior is similar to other large cats):** The text states that lions are similar in behavior to other large cats, implying cooperative hunting and a ruthless nature.



"
Remby mahazatra ho an’ny karazana biby mpiremby inona ny bitro?,"The correct answer is **A: Saka kely (Small animals)**.

The text states: ""Farany, misy saka kely maro (anisan’izany ireo saka fiompy) izay mihinana ireo remby kely maro an’isa toy ny bibikely, ny mpikiky, ny androngo sy ny vorona."" (Finally, many small animals (including shrews) eat small reptiles such as rodents, mice, hedgehogs, and birds.)
"
Iza amin'ireto no matetika hazain’ny saka kely?,"The correct answer is **A: Biby mpikiky**.

The text states: ""Fany, misy saka kely maro (anisan’izany ireo saka fiompy) izay mihinana ireo remby kely maro an’isa toy ny bibikely, ny mpikiky, ny androngo sy ny vorona.""  This translates to: ""Finally, there are many small animals (including dormice) that eat small rodents such as mice, **squirrels**, rats and birds.""

Therefore, the small animals (specifically dormice, mentioned as an example of a small animal) frequently eat squirrels.
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ao anatin’ny fomba fihazana ocelot?,"The correct answer is **D: Biby madinika kokoa ihany no hazaina (Only smaller animals are hunted)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ocelots hunt a variety of prey, including rodents, birds, and monkeys. All prey caught by the ocelot are shorter than it.""  This means they don't *only* hunt smaller animals.  They also hunt monkeys.

Let's break down the other options:

*   **A: Miafina manodidina azy ireo (They sneak around them):**  The text says they stalk prey by scent and are silent. This implies they sneak around.
*   **B: Manaraka ny fofon’ny rembiny (They follow the scent of their prey):** The text explicitly states this: ""Scientists believe that ocelots follow and detect prey by scent when they sniff the ground where their prey has been.""
*   **C: Manaraka ny rembiny mandritra ny alina (They follow their prey at night):** The text says they have good night vision and are silent while moving, suggesting they hunt at night.

Therefore, only option D is not mentioned in the text as part of how ocelots hunt.

"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina tsara ny ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: Tsy mahery ny fahaizany mifofona (They are not good at smelling)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""The scientists believe that the ocelot follows and detects prey (rabbits) by scent, when they sniff the ground where they have walked."" This indicates that ocelots *are* good at smelling.  The other options are all supported by the text.
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy heverina ho tanjaka lehibe indrindra ho an’ny tigra?,"The correct answer is **A: Mieronerona**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while tigers *can* roar, it's not as powerful or similar to a lion's roar. It's more like a mix of hisses and crackles. The passage highlights the other abilities (fighting, pouncing, and ""pulling down"" prey) as significant strengths. Therefore, roaring is presented as *not* a primary strength.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto no tsy mampitovy ny tigra sy ny liona?","The correct answer is **B: Ny feon'ny fieroneronany (The sound of their roar)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the roar of a tiger is *not* the same as a lion's roar. It's more like a mixture of growls and akiakiaka sounds.
* The text says that tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars are the only ones capable of roaring.
* The text mentions tigers can pounce, leap long distances, and lift ten times the strength of a human.

Therefore, the difference in the sound of their roars is the only point presented as *not* being shared between tigers and lions."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, nanao inona i Robert Hooke talohan’ireo biolojista hafa?","The correct answer is **A: Nandinika ny sela maty**.

The text states: ""Robert Hooke, biolojista avy any Angletera, dia nahita efa-joro tamin’ny bosoa tamin’ny mikroskopy. Tahaka ny efitra ireo. Izy no olona voalohany nandinika sela maty.""  This directly indicates he was the first to examine dead cells.



"
"""Inona no dikan'ny teny niavian’ny hoe """"sela""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Efitra madinika**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ny teny hoe """"cell"""" (sela) dia avy amin’ny teny latina hoe """"cella"""" izay midika hoe **efitra kely**.""  (The word ""cell"" (sela) comes from the Latin word ""cella"" which means **small room**.)
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, mahay manao inona ny ankamaroan'ny biby?","The correct answer is **B: Mihetsika**.

The text states: ""Afaka mihetsika ny ankamaroan’ny biby"" which translates to ""Most of the animals can move.""

While the text mentions other actions (mandavaka - roam, milomano - roar, mandidina - fly), it explicitly states that most animals *can move*.  ""Mihetsika"" (to move) is the most general and accurate description of what most animals can do according to the passage.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy ananan’ny biby sasany?","The correct answer is **C: Atidoha**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ny biby ihany no manana atidoha (na dia tsy hoe manana daholo aza ny biby rehetra; toy ny horitalahy izao dia tsy misy atidoha)."" This translates to: ""Only animals have a stomach (although not all animals have one; like a whale, for example, has no stomach).""
"
Inona no manampy ny zavamaniry amin'ny fizotry ny fôtôsentezy?,"The correct answer is **D: Masoandro**.

Here's why:

*   **Photosynthesis** is the process where plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food (sugars) and release oxygen. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Alokaloka** - Plants *produce* oxygen during photosynthesis, they don't *use* it as an ingredient.
*   **B: Biby** - Plants don't need animals for photosynthesis.
*   **C: Sakafo** - Plants *create* food during photosynthesis; they don't use food as an ingredient in the process.



"
Inona no avoakan'ny olombelona ka fohan’ny zavamaniry?,"The correct answer is **D: Gazy karbônika**.

The question asks what humans exhale that plants use. The text states: ""Ny zavamaniry dia mamorona oksizena izay fohan’ny olombelona, ary mitroka ny gazy karbonika izay avoakan’ny olombelona..."" (Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale...).

Therefore, the answer is carbon dioxide.

"
Iza amin'ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina tsara ny fizotry ny fiforonan-karazana vaovao? ,"The answer is **A: Mitranga izany rehefa tsy hain’ny mponina vaovao ny mampifanaraka ny tenany (It happens when the new population is unable to adapt themselves)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the new population *does* adapt. It mentions they need to find structures and learn to fight stronger because of the new environment's resources. This directly contradicts option A, which says they are *unable* to adapt.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Lafiny manan-danja izy io amin'ny fizotran'ny fivoarana (It is a significant aspect of the development process):** The text states that the formation of new lineages is an unavoidable outcome and a significant component of development.
* **C: Manondro ny fiforonan'ny karazana vaovao izy io (It points to the formation of a new species):** The text explicitly says the process is called ""formation of a new lineage.""
* **D: Ny fisehoany dia tsy azo ihodivirana (Its occurrence is unavoidable):** The text states that the formation of new lineages is an unavoidable outcome.



Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't accurately reflect the information presented in the text."
Iza amin’ny ampahany amin'ny rafi-pitatitra no mitondra rà mankany amin'ny fo?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpanelirà (Vena)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks which part of the circulatory system carries blood *to* the heart.
* The passage states: ""Ny rà amin’ny alalan’ny fantsona antsoina hoe mpanelirà ary miverina ao amin’ny fo amin’ny alalan’ny fantsona antsoina hoe mpamerindrà.""  This translates to: ""Blood leaves the heart through a vessel called the vena and returns to the heart through a vessel called the arteria.""
* Therefore, the vena (or mpanelirà in Malagasy) is the vessel that carries blood *from* the heart *to* the rest of the body.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lalan-drà vaventy (Artery):** Arteries carry blood *away* from the heart.
* **C: Taova (Vein):** Veins carry blood *towards* the heart.
* **D: Lalan-drà (Vessel/Arteriole):** This is a general term and not specific to the pathway *to* the heart.  ""Lalandrà madinika"" (arteriole) is a small type of artery, which carries blood *away* from the heart.



"
Iza avy no fantsona kely indrindra ao amin'ny rafi-pitatitra?,"The correct answer is **A: Lalan-drà vaventy (Ventricles)**.

The text states: ""Ny fantsona kely indrindra dia antsoina hoe lalandrà madinika."" This translates to ""The smallest vessels are called ventricles.""  Therefore, ""Lalan-drà vaventy"" (which means ventricles) is the correct answer.
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no mampitombo ny fahafahan’ny bibikely mampiforitra ny elany?,"The correct answer is **B: Fiafenana (Camouflage)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Manana tombony ny akamaroan’ireo bibikely manidina satria afaka mamoritra ny elany amin’ny vatany izy. Io dia manome azy ireo toerana kely maromaro kokoa hahafahany miafina an’ireo fahavalo miremby."" (Flying animals benefit from being able to camouflage themselves with their bodies. This gives them more hiding places to avoid predators.)

* **Camouflage** is the act of blending in with the surroundings, which is precisely what the passage describes the animals doing with their fur/feathers to avoid predators.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Famatsiana sakafo (Food supply):**  While food is essential for survival, the passage doesn't connect it to the ability to camouflage.
* **C: Fahitana namana (Seeing companions):**  Seeing companions doesn't relate to camouflage ability.
* **D: Hafainganana amin’ny fanidinana (Speed in flight):**  While speed helps escape predators, the passage focuses on *hiding* from them, which is the purpose of camouflage.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra toa zavatra iharan’ny fiantraikan’ny fahafahan’ny bibikely manidina?,"The correct answer is **A: Fampitomboana taranaka (Reproduction)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the advantages of flight for survival and finding resources (food and mates).** It mentions how flight helps escape predators, find food, and attract mates.
* **While the passage implies increased survival, it doesn't directly state that flight *leads to* increased reproduction.** It's a logical inference, but not explicitly mentioned.
* **B (Faharetan’ny andro iainana - Lifespan), C (Fanangonana sakafo - Foraging), and D (Fahombiazana - Success)** are all directly or indirectly related to the benefits of flight discussed in the passage. Flight aids in escaping predators (improving lifespan), finding food (foraging), and ultimately, successful survival.

Therefore, the option *not* mentioned in the context of the passage is the direct impact on reproduction.
"
Iza amin'ireto toetra manaraka ireto no tsy mahazatra mikasika ny dinôzôro?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny fandehanana amin’ny tongotra aoriana (Walking on two legs)**.

Here's why:

* **Dinosaurs and Bipedalism:** While some dinosaurs *did* walk on two legs (like the T-Rex mentioned in the text), it wasn't a universal characteristic of all dinosaurs. Many dinosaurs were quadrupedal (walked on four legs).
* **The Question's Premise:** The passage highlights that birds are considered descendants of dinosaurs *because* they share characteristics like feathers, beaks, and the ability to run and climb. The fact that some dinosaurs walked on two legs is a shared trait that connects them to birds, making it *not* uncommon.
* **Other Options are Common in Birds and Dinosaurs:**
    * **Volo (Feathers):**  A key characteristic linking birds and dinosaurs.
    * **Fanatodizana (Sharp Claws):** Many dinosaurs and birds have sharp claws.
    * **Tongotra mihoho (Beak-like Mouth):**  Many dinosaurs had beak-like mouths, and birds definitely do.

Therefore, the statement that dinosaurs walked on two legs is the one that is *least* consistent with the overall characteristics shared between dinosaurs and birds, and thus the outlier."
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy mahazatra fa heverina ho toetra iombonan'ny vorona sy ny dinôzôro?,"The correct answer is **C: Mahay manidina (Can fly)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that paleontologists believe birds are descended from dinosaurs. This is a well-established scientific fact.
* The passage highlights similarities between birds and dinosaurs, including having claws, beaks, and bipedal (two-legged) movement (like the T-Rex).
* However, while some dinosaurs *may have* been able to glide or have feathers for insulation, the ability to *fly* is a defining characteristic of birds and not typically associated with all dinosaurs.  The passage specifically contrasts this with the common perception of dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Manatody (Are carnivorous):** Many dinosaurs and birds are carnivorous.
* **B: Mampiasa tongotra roa aoriana handehanana (Use two legs for walking):**  Bipedalism is a shared trait of many dinosaurs and birds.
* **D: Tongotra misy hoho (Claws):** Both dinosaurs and birds have claws.



Therefore, the ability to fly is the least expected similarity between dinosaurs and birds, making it the outlier.

"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no angambaina hohanin'ny Tricératops? ","The correct answer is **D: Zavamaniry misy poizina ny voankazony (Poisonous plants)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, which are described as having ""poisonous sap.""
* The text also mentions that some animals, like sloths and anteaters (related to dinosaurs), can eat poisonous plants. This supports the idea that Triceratops *could* have eaten the cycads despite the potential poison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bibikamo (Mammals):** While Triceratops was a dinosaur, the text doesn't say it ate mammals.
* **B: Zavamaniry henjan-drantsana (Ferns):** The text doesn't mention ferns as a food source for Triceratops.
* **C: Boloky (Anteaters):**  While the text mentions anteaters eating poisonous plants, it's not the *primary* food source of Triceratops according to the text.  The focus is on the cycads and their potential poison.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto fanatanjahantena manaraka ireto no angambaina ho malaza be any amin'ireo faritra farany avaratr’i Italia?","The correct answer is **A: Baolina kitra**.

The text states: ""Ny lalao tanterahina amin’ny ririnina no malaza indrindra any amin’ny faritra Avaratra, izay ahitàna Italianina mifaninana amin’ny lalao iraisam-pirenena sy ôlaimpika."" (The games played in the winter are most popular in the Northern region, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.)

While several sports are played in the winter, the text specifically mentions that Italians compete in ""lalao iraisam-pirenena sy ôlaimpika"" (international and Olympic games) in the north, implying popularity.  Football (baolina kitra) is consistently a major international and Olympic sport. Snowboarding and Volleyball are not explicitly mentioned as being particularly popular in the North in the text. While F1 racing is mentioned, it doesn't directly relate to popular winter sports in the Northern region. Therefore, football is the most likely answer.
"
"Araka ny fampahalalana omena ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza tamin'ireto fanatanjahantena manaraka ireto no nahazoan’i Italia ny tompondaka maneran-tany?","The correct answer is **A: Baolina kitra (Football)**.

This directly links the Italian national football team to winning the FIFA World Cup.
"
Taorian'ny zava-nitranga inona no nahatonga ny faritra sasany tao Luxembourg ho Belza?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny Revolisiona Belza**.

The question asks what event made part of Luxembourg Belgian. The text explicitly states: ""Ny ampahan’i Belzika amin’izao fotoana izao, izay dia ampahan’i Luxembourg taloha fa lasa Belza taorian’ny revolusiona belza taorian’ny taona 1830."" (The Belgian part at this time, which was formerly part of Luxembourg, became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution after 1830.)



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no niantraika tamin'ny fialanalanan’i Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Fibodoan’ny Alemana**.

Here's why:

*   **Fibodoan’ny Alemana (German Occupation):** The text explicitly states that Luxembourg was occupied by Germany during both World War I and World War II. This occupation significantly impacted Luxembourg's sovereignty and independence.
*   **Fidirana tao amin'ny Vondrona Eoropeanina (Joining the European Union):** The text mentions Luxembourg's founding membership in the European Union, but it doesn't frame this as a *cause* of its loss of independence. Rather, it describes a later development.
*   **Ny Revolisiona Belza (The Belgian Revolution):** The text describes Luxembourg as part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution. While this changed its political status, it doesn't directly relate to a loss of independence caused by an external force, as the question implies.
*   **Fahalasanany ho firenena mahaleo tena (Its Independence):** The question asks what *impacted* its loss of independence.  The text states Luxembourg gained independence in 1839, implying the *loss* of independence happened *after* that. Therefore, its independence isn't the impact, but rather something that was affected.



Therefore, the German occupation is the direct and significant factor that impacted Luxembourg's sovereignty and independence during a crucial period."
Firy kilometatra toradroa amin’ny velarantanin'i Torkia no ao anatin’i Eoropa?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""ny 23.764 km² (9.174 mi²) kosa dia ao Eoropa."" which translates to ""only 23,764 km² (9,174 mi²) are in Europe.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, sahabo ho firy maily ny halavan’i Torkia?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Ny faritanin’i Tiorkia dia mihoatra ny 1.600 kilaometatra (1.000 mi) ny halavany..."" which translates to ""The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) long...""
"
Ampiasaina amin’ny inona ny fiteny Latina ao Vatikana?,"The correct answer is **A: Lanonana amin’ny fivavahana** (Religious ceremonies).

The text explicitly states: ""raha ny Latina kosa no fampiasa matetika mandritra ny fanompoam-pivavahana."" This translates to ""while Latin is frequently used during religious worship.""
"
"Ao Vatikana, inona no tsy ampiasana ny fiteny Italiana?","The correct answer is **C: Lanonana amin’ny fivavahana (Religious ceremonies)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Italian is used for laws and official communications, and also for general communication among residents.
* It explicitly mentions that Latin is commonly used during religious ceremonies.

Therefore, Latin is the language *not* used in Vatican City, while Italian is.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto tombontsoa manaraka ireto no azo amin’ny fampifangaroana feo amin'ny solosaina be pitsopitsony?","The correct answer is **A: Mozika**.

The passage states: ""Matetika ny mozika dia alaina feo amin'ny fampiasana solosaina raitra amin’ny fikirakirana sy ny fanakambanana ireo feo."" which translates to: ""Music is often taken as audio using powerful computers for processing and mixing those sounds.""

The passage also mentions that computers are used for editing images and videos, and high-resolution images are becoming increasingly common. While computers are used for these things, the passage specifically links the use of powerful computers to audio processing and mixing of *music*.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, amin’ny ankamaroan'ny trano fonenana, any amin'ny toerana aiza no ahitana kabone manary amin’ny rano?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage states: ""Tao an-tanànan’i Arapa sy Mohenjo-daro dia samy nanana kabine misy rano ao amin’ny ankamaroan’ny trano tsirairay..."" which translates to ""In the city of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, each house had a bathroom...""  Therefore, Mohenjo-daro is the place mentioned alongside Harappa where bathrooms were common in most houses.
"
Aiza tamin'ireto toerana manaraka ireto no nahitana fantsona fandehanan’ny rano maloto manara-penitra?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""Tao an-tanànan’i Arapa sy Mohenjo-daro dia samy nanana kabine misy rano ao amin’ny ankamaroan’ny trano tsirairay, izay nifandray tamina lakan-drano fanariana rano maloto ary fomba."" This directly links Harappa (part of the Indus Valley Civilization, which includes Mohenjo-daro) with advanced sewage systems.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate based on the passage:

* **B: Santorini:** The passage mentions drainage systems in Minoan settlements on Santorini, but doesn't specifically describe ""fantsona fandehanan’ny rano maloto manara-penitra"" (sophisticated sewage systems).
* **C: Egypta:** The passage mentions latrines in Egypt but doesn't detail a sophisticated sewer system.
* **D: Sina:** The passage mentions latrines in Sina, but not a sophisticated sewer system.



Therefore, Harappa is the only location listed where the passage directly references sophisticated sewage systems."
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no mampihodina ny mpanao skate?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny sisiny roa manamorona ny lelan'ny skate (The two sides bordering the skate's ledge)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the two sides of the skate's ledge are what cause the rider to turn.  ""Raha makany amin’ny ankavanana ny fikorisana, dia mivily miankavanana ny mpitondra azy..."" (When the push is towards the right, the rider leans to the right...) and ""...makany amin’ny ankavia ny fikorisana, dia makany amin’ny ankavia ny mpitondra azy..."" (When the push is towards the left, the rider leans to the left...). This directly links the sides of the ledge to the rider's movement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ny fiolahana kely eo ambanin’ny lelan'ny skate (The small gap under the skate's ledge):** The passage says the gaps help with grinding, not with turning the rider.
*   **C: Ny fahaiza-manaon'ny mpanao skate amin'ny ankapobeny (The rider's overall skill):** The passage focuses on a specific feature of the skate, not the rider's general skill.
*   **D: Ny kalitaon'ny ranomandry (The quality of the water):** The passage mentions the water interacting with the ledge and the rider, but the water quality isn't the cause of the rider turning.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra marina tsara ny lavaka eo amin'ny lelan'ny skate an-dranomandry maoderina?","The correct answer is **A: Roa ny lelany**.

The passage states: ""Misy lavaka roa eo anelanelany."" (There are two holes between them.) This directly indicates that there are two holes in the skate's fin.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mifaingoka** (Speeding) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the fin's speed.
*   **C: Milempona** (Slipping) - While the holes contribute to the skate's ability to grip, the passage doesn't describe the fin as slipping.
*   **D: Mitongilana** (Curving) - The passage states the holes allow the skate to curve, but it doesn't describe the fin itself as curving.

Therefore, the only statement directly supported by the text is that there are two holes in the fin."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona ilay fizotra ahafahan'ny atôma manala ny angovo tafahoatra amin'ny hazavana?","The correct answer is **B: Ny fanairana famoahana voan-kazavana (émission stimulée de radiation)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ataon’izy ireo izany amin’ny fandefasana ampahana hazavana kely izay antsoina hoe """"voan-kazavana.” Ny siantifika dia miantso ity zotra ity ho “émission stimulée de radiation”"".
* This translates to: ""They do this by emitting a small burst of light called ""fluorescence"". Scientists call this process ""stimulated emission of radiation"".""
* Therefore, the process by which the atom loses excess energy is stimulated emission of radiation, which is synonymous with fluorescence in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ny taratra (Radiation):** While radiation is involved, the passage specifies *stimulated emission*.
* **C: Ny voan-kazavana (Fluorescence):** Fluorescence is the *result* of the process, not the process itself.
* **D: Ny fanairana famoahana taratra (Emission de radiation):**  This is a general term. The passage specifies *stimulated* emission, making option B the more accurate answer.



"
Inona no mahatonga ny atôma mamoaka voan-kazavana?,"The correct answer is **B: Fanairana vokatry ny hazavana mamiratra**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ataon’izy ireo izany amin’ny fandefasana ampahana hazavana kely izay antsoina hoe """"voan-kazavana.” Ny siantifika dia miantso ity zotra ity hoe “émission stimulée de radiation” satria ny ataoma dia tairin'ny hazavana mamiratra, izay miteraka voan-kazavana..."" 

This translates to: ""They do this by emitting small bursts of light called ""fluorescence."" Scientists call this process ""stimulated emission of radiation"" because the atom is hit by shining light, which causes fluorescence...""

Therefore, the atom emits fluorescence *because* it's hit by shining light (radiation). This is stimulated emission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ny famoahana angovo tafahoatra** (Emission of excess energy) - While energy is involved, the text specifies *how* the energy is emitted (stimulated by light).
* **C: Ny ambaratongan’angovo tsy marin-toerana** (Unstable energy) - The text doesn't mention instability as the cause.
* **D: Fiota tsy mifanaraka amin'ny taratra** (Incompatible vibration with rays) - This is not relevant to the explanation of fluorescence.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mety hahatonga ny takamoan’ny ampoly ho maty nony farany?","The correct answer is **B: Ny ampahan’ny vodiny vy amin'ny ampola ihany no mitsatoka.**

The text states: ""Ny herinaratra mandalo amin’ilay fitsatohana misy ny faritra metalikan’ny takamoa dia mety hahatonga famaizana mafy avy amin’ny herinaritra raha toa ka voakasikao ny faritra anatin’ilay fitsatohana na ilay fanambany metalikan’ilay takamoa raha mbola misy ampahany kely tavela ao anatin’ilay fitsatohana.""  This means a short circuit (caused by the metal part of the lamp touching something it shouldn't) can cause a short circuit and prevent the lamp from working.  Option B describes precisely that.
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no mety zava-doza raha voakasika rehefa manolo ampola?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny tamba-tariby**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that touching the metal parts of the lamp fixture while the power is still on can cause severe burns.  The question asks what could be dangerous if touched while replacing a bulb.  Therefore, the answer must be the electrical wiring (tamba-tariby) inside the fixture.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ny sarikofehy (The glass)** - While glass can break, it's not the primary electrical hazard mentioned.
* **B: Ny famonoana jiro (Turning off the light)** - This is the *first step* you should take to avoid the hazard, not something that would be dangerous to touch *after* turning it off.
* **C: Ny vodin’ny ampola (The bulb base)** - The bulb base *is* metal, and therefore could be dangerous if it came into contact with the wiring. However, ""tamba-tariby"" is the broader and more accurate term for the electrical wiring itself, making it the better answer.



"
"Araka ny andalana, inona no mitranga rehefa mipasaka ny vihy?","The correct answer is **B: Mivoaka ny angovo**.

The passage states: ""The fission of an atom releases some of this energy.""  Fission is the process of an atom splitting.  The passage also says that the atom's uneven distribution of mass causes it to fly apart, releasing energy.
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no ahitana taratra ny antso an-tany lavitra mankety an-tany,"The correct answer is **C: Hazavana**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what travels the signal from the satellite to Earth.** The problem states the satellite sends a signal down to Earth. This signal is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Teleskaopy:** Telescopes are instruments used to *receive* signals, not transmit them.
    * **B: Zanabolana:**  A meteoroid is a small rocky body traveling through space. It's not involved in transmitting the signal.
    * **D: Sambon-danitra:** The atmosphere is what interferes with the signal, not the thing that carries the signal itself.



Therefore, the signal that travels from the satellite to Earth is light (electromagnetic radiation).



"
Iza amin'ireto no ampiasaina hametrahana teleskaopy eny an’habakabaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Zanabolana any amin’ny 100 feet mahery any ambony**.

Here's why:

* The question states that a ""zanabolana any amin’ny 100 feet mahery any ambony"" (a 100 feet or more long rocket) is used to launch satellites and telescopes into space. 
* The passage mentions that a telescope is needed in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light. 
*  Therefore, a rocket is the tool needed to transport the telescope to the space where it can function effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fehezana tara-pahazavana (Light-gathering lens):** This is a component *of* a telescope, not the mechanism for getting the telescope *into* space.
* **B: Balaafo asesi-motera (Rocket engine):** While a rocket engine is *part* of a rocket, the question asks for the *entire* tool used to launch.
* **C: Soson-drivotry ny tany (Earth's rotation):** Earth's rotation is a natural phenomenon, not a tool used to launch objects into space.



"
Inona no tokony ho marihina momba ny tsingerina fotoana mba hanarahana ny fandehan'ny fotoana?,"The correct answer is **B: Famerimberenana (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""tranga mitsingerina"" which translates to ""recurring events"" or ""repeating patterns."" The question asks what should be noted about ""tsingerina fotoana"" (recurring time) to follow the flow of time.  The key characteristic of recurring events is that they *repeat*.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Faharetana (Duration):** While time has duration, the passage is focusing on patterns rather than length.
*   **C: Fanaovana fihetsika (Action):**  The passage doesn't emphasize action as the core of recurring time.
*   **D: Fahasarotana (Difficulty):** The passage acknowledges the difficulty in understanding time, but this isn't what should be noted about *recurring* time.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, lafiny inona amin'ny tranga iray no fampitaha amin’ny fotoana?","The correct answer is **A: Faharetana (Duration)**.

The text states: ""Ny fotoana ihany koa dia ny fomba ampitahaintsika ny faharetan’ireo (halava) tranga."" This translates to ""Time is also the way we measure the duration of (long) events.""

While the event is described as recurring (""tranga mitsingerina"" - recurring event), the text directly links time to *measuring the duration* of those events.  The other options aren't directly connected to the comparison made in the passage.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no heverina fa fahita mahazatra ho an’ny mpandova seza fiandrianana?","The correct answer is **B: Mandao ny oniversite hiditra ho miaramila.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ara-pomba dia mandalo fiofanana ara-miaramila ny mpandova ny seza fiandrianana aorian’ny fahavitany ny fianarana an-tsekoly."" This translates to: ""It is customary for heirs to the throne to undergo military training after completing their schooling.""

Option B directly reflects this customary practice.  The passage then goes on to describe Charles's *different* path, going to university. This highlights that while military training is *customary*, it's not the only path, and Charles took a different one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mahazo diplaoma 2:2:** While Charles obtained a 2:2 degree, the passage doesn't say this is typical for heirs.
*   **C: Mianatra Tantara:**  Charles studied history, but the passage doesn't suggest this is a standard educational path for heirs.
*   **D: Mankany amin'ny oniversite alohan'ny hidirana ho miaramila:**  The passage indicates the opposite – that military training happens *after* schooling, not before university.



"
"Araka ny fanazavana nomena tao amin’ilay andalana, i Charles no voalohany nanao inona?","The correct answer is **C: Nahazo diplaoma**.

The passage states: ""I Charles no voalohany nomena diplaoma tamin’ny fianakavian’ny mpanjakan’i Grande Bretagne."" This translates to ""I Charles was the first to be given a diploma in the British royal family.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Niditra ho miaramila talohan'ny namitana fianarana** - The passage says he *didn't* become a military officer immediately after school.
* **B: Nianatra Arkeolojia** - He studied Anthropology, Archaeology, and History. Archaeology was one of them, but not the defining first thing he did.
* **D: Nandray anjara tao amin'ny Oniversiten’i Trinity** - While he did attend the university, the passage emphasizes his achievement of being the first to receive a diploma.



"
Avy tamin’ny firenena iza ny sambon'i Trygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: Norvezy**.

The text states: ""Olaf Trygvasson no nitarika ny andian-tsambo, Norvezianina iray..."" which translates to ""Olaf Trygvasson led the fleet, a Norwegian...""
"
Tamin’ny fotoana inona teo amin’ny tantara no nampiharan’i Alemaina fitaomana ara-kolontsaina matanjaka teo amin’i Estonia?,"The correct answer is **B: Teo ho eo amin’ny 400 taona lasa izay**.

The text states ""Manodidina ny taon-jato faha15"" which translates to ""Around the 15th century"". The question asks about the time when Germany exerted cultural pressure on Estonia. The 15th century is approximately 600 years ago. Since the options are close, and we are looking for the closest, 400 years ago is the best fit. While slightly off from the 15th century itself, it's the closest available answer.

Let's break down the timeframes:

*   **A: Teo ho eo amin’ny 200 taona lasa izay** (Around 200 years ago) - Too recent.
*   **B: Teo ho eo amin’ny 400 taona lasa izay** (Around 400 years ago) - Closest to the 15th century.
*   **C: Teo ho eo amin’ny 600 taona lasa izay** (Around 600 years ago) - A bit too far back.
*   **D: Teo ho eo amin’ny 800 taona lasa izay** (Around 800 years ago) - Too far back.



"
Nahazo fitaomana avy amin’ny inona ny fiteny Estoniana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny abidy alemà** (The German alphabet).

The text states that the Estonian liturgical language originated from the German alphabet and added the diacritic ""Õ/õ"".
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, miovaova arakaraka ny anton-javatra inona ny isan'ny mpiteny Hindi teratany?","The correct answer is **A: Raha isaina ny tenim-paritra tena mifanakaiky amin'ny Hindi**

The text states: ""Isan’ny teratany mpampiasa ny teny reny dia miankina amin’ny hoe isaina ve ireo tenim-paritra mifanakaiky aminy."" which translates to ""The number of native speakers depends on the number of closely related languages.""
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no fanambarana marina mikasika ny fiteny Hindi sy Urdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsy mitovy ny soratra ao amin'izy ireo** (They do not have the same writing system).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""teny Hindi sy Urdu dia misy itovizany amin’ny voambolana fa samy hafa kosa ny fanoratra azy"" (Hindi and Urdu have similarities in vocabulary but have different writing systems).
* Option A is incorrect because the text says they often *understand* each other.
* Option C is incorrect because the text clearly states they have different writing systems.
* Option D is incorrect because the text says they have similar vocabulary.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy marina mikasika ny abidy Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **D: Niniana noforonina izy io** (It was created by aliens).

Here's why:

* **A: Noforonina tamin'ny fiandohan'ny fanjakan'i Sejong izy io (It was created at the beginning of King Sejong's reign):** This is **correct**. King Sejong initiated the creation of Hangeul.
* **B: Hunan Jeongeum no tena anaran'ny abidy tany am-boalohany (Hunmin Jeongeum was the original name of the alphabet):** This is **correct**. Hunmin Jeongeum was the original name, meaning ""The Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People.""
* **C: Noforonin'ny mpanjaka fahefatra tamin'ny tarana-mpanjaka Joseon izy io (It was created by a powerful king during the Joseon Dynasty):** This is **correct**. King Sejong was a powerful and respected king of the Joseon Dynasty.
* **D: Niniana noforonina izy io (It was created by aliens):** This is **incorrect and false**.  There is no basis for this claim. Hangeul was created by Korean scholars and King Sejong.



Therefore, the only statement that is not true is that aliens created the Hangeul alphabet.
"
Niova ho inona tamin'ny farany ny abidy Hunmin Jeongeum?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The text states that Hunmin Jeongeum was the original name of the alphabet, and it later changed to Hangeul.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona avy ireo fiteny nandova singa tamin’ny Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **A: Fiteny latina**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sanskrita dia azo oharina amin’ny teny Latina izay nampiasaina tany Eoropa."" (Sanskrit can be compared to the Latin language used in Europe.)

While the text mentions Sanskrit is a ""teny fahiny"" (ancient language) and is the source of modern Indian languages, it directly compares it to Latin.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, nihena noho ny inona ny fampiasana fiteny Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **D: Ny ambaratongam-pifehezana (Ambaratongam-pifehezana)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sanskrit dia nanjavona fotsiny ny Sanskrit noho ny ambaratongam-pahefana."" which translates to ""Sanskrit was only marginalized due to power structures/political power.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Be pitsipitsiny (Be pitsipitsiny)** - The text doesn't mention anything about the language being complicated. It highlights its complexity and richness.
*   **B: Ny fifindra-monina Aryan (Ny fifindra-monina Aryan)** - While the text mentions the Aryan migration as the origin of Sanskrit, it doesn't state it as the reason for the decline in its use.
*   **C: Fiteny latina (Fiteny latina)** - Latin is mentioned as a comparison to Sanskrit, but not as a reason for the decline of Sanskrit.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no fanambarana marina momba ny gravité sur Io?","The correct answer is **A: Kely kokoa eo aminao ny fiantraikan’ny vesatry ny tany noho ny vesatr’i Io**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that you weigh 200 pounds on Earth but only 36 pounds on Io.
* This means the gravitational pull of Io is weaker than the gravitational pull of Earth.
* Therefore, the gravitational force acting on you on Io is less, making you feel lighter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Misintona bebe kokoa ny vesatr’i Io, ka izany no mahatonga anao ho maivana kokoa:** This is incorrect because Io's gravity is *weaker*, not stronger.
* **C: Misintona bebe kokoa ny vesatr’i Io, ka izany no mahatonga anao ho mavesatra kokoa:** Same as above, Io's gravity is weaker.
* **D: Ny vesatry ny tany dia hisintona anao bebe kokoa noho ny sinton'i Io:**  This is true, but the passage focuses on the comparison between Earth's and Io's gravity.  The question asks for a statement about Io's gravity specifically.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra tsara ny sosona ivelan'ny Volana?","The correct answer is **A: Manana hodi-tany matevina kokoa ilay ilany akaiky.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""70 km eo ho eo ny hatevin’ny hoditany amin’ny ilany akaiky, ary 100 km ny hateviny amin’ny ilany lavitra."" (The thickness of the crust is approximately 70 km on the near side, and 100 km on the far side.)
* This clearly indicates that the near side has a thicker crust than the far side. Therefore, option A accurately describes the crust.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Manify kokoa ny hodi-tany ao ambanin’ny faritra avo:** The passage states the opposite - the crust is thicker on higher areas.
* **C: Mety tsy dia misy maria amin'ny ilany lavitra:** The passage says the near side *may* have more maria due to a thinner crust. It doesn't say the far side has *no* maria.
* **D: Mety tsy dia misy maria ao ambanin’ny faritra avo:**  The passage doesn't mention anything about maria and higher areas.

Therefore, **A** is the only option directly supported by the passage."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, aiza no matevina indrindra ny hodi-tanin'ny Volana?","The correct answer is **C: Ambanin'ny faritra avo**.

The text states: ""Manify kokoa ny ao ambanin’ny maria ary matevina kokoa ny ao ambanin’ny faritra avo."" which translates to ""It is thinner underneath the maria and thicker underneath the highlands.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no inoan’ny olona sasany?","The correct answer is **C: Misy fiainana any amin'ny planeta hafa (There is life on other planets)**.

The passage states: ""...many people wonder what is there, some even believe in aliens or other life that may exist on other planets."" This directly supports option C.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nandeha tany amin'ny kintana hafa ny olombelona (Humans have traveled to other planets):** The passage explicitly says that traveling to other planets is not possible *yet*.
*   **B: Tsy mahavita mizaha tontolo hafa ny olombelona (Humans are unable to explore other worlds):** While the passage mentions the difficulty, it also implies that exploration *will* happen eventually.
*   **D: Latsaky ny arivo tapitrisa maily ny elanelan'ny kintana (The distance between stars is less than a few thousand light-years):** The passage states that even the closest stars are thousands of light-years away.



"
Inona no lasa manify kokoa rehefa miha-manalavitra ny afovoan'ny Masoandro isika?,"The correct answer is **C: Gaza**.

The passage states: ""Lasa mihamanify ny entona arakaraka ny analaviranao ny afovoan’ny Masoandro."" This translates to ""The density of the atmosphere thins as you move away from the center of the Sun.""  The Sun's outer layers are primarily composed of gases (plasma is a state of matter, but in this context, ""gaza"" - gas - is a more direct and accurate description of the Sun's composition).

Therefore, the density *of the gas* thins as you move away from the Sun's core.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, ampahany inona amin'ny masoandro no hita avy ety an-tany?","The correct answer is **C: Ny photosphère**.

The passage states: ""Faritra ivelany izay hitantsika rehefa mijery ny Masoandro no antsoina hoe photosphère, izay midika hoe “baolin’ny hazavana”."" (The outer layer that we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means ""shell of light"".)
"
Iza amin'ireto fanamarihana manaraka ireto no nanamafy ny teorian’i Copernic?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny fotoam-piovan’i Venus (The phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

*   **Galileo's observation of Venus's phases:** Galileo's observation of the phases of Venus was a crucial piece of evidence supporting Copernicus's heliocentric theory (that planets orbit the Sun). The phases of Venus (like the Moon) can only be explained if Venus orbits the Sun.  If Venus orbited the Earth, it would always appear as a crescent shape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ny fandalovan’i Venus (The transit of Venus):** While the transit of Venus is interesting, it doesn't directly prove the heliocentric model.
*   **C: Ny fitovian’ny Masoandro amin'ny Venus (Venus's conjunction with the Sun):**  Conjunctions happen regardless of the planetary system.
*   **D: Ny fitovian’ny Masoandro amin'ny Volana (The conjunction of the Sun and the Moon):** Similar to C, this doesn't provide evidence for the heliocentric model. It just describes an alignment of celestial bodies.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsikaritr’i Galileo Galilei tamin'ny 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny fotoam-piovan’i Venus**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Galileo used a telescope in 1610 to observe **phases of Venus**.  The phases (like the Moon) are visible because only a portion of the illuminated Venus is facing the Sun from our perspective.
* While the phases of Venus *supported* Copernicus's heliocentric theory (the idea that planets orbit the Sun), Galileo's *direct observation* in 1610 was of the phases themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ny ilan’ny Volana manatrika ny Masoandro** - While Galileo did observe the phases of the Moon, the question specifically asks about his findings regarding *Venus*.
* **C: Ny fihodidin’ny planeta amin’ny Masoandro** -  Galileo's observations of Venus supported this, but the observation itself was of the phases, not the orbit.
* **D: Ny fandalovan’i Venus** - While Venus does pass in front of the sun, the passage does not state that Galileo discovered this. Jeremiah Horrocks is credited with observing a Venus transit in 1639.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, avy aiza ny ranon’ny Renirano Amazona?","The correct answer is **A: Avy amin’ny renirano madinika kokoa (From smaller rivers)**.

The text states: ""Izy io dia manangona rano avy amina ony kelikely aman’arivony."" which translates to ""It collects water from hundreds of smaller rivers.""
"
Inona no laza tsy nomena ny Reniranon'i Amazonia?,"The correct answer is **D: Izy no renirano midadasika indrindra** (It is the widest river).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river by volume.
* It also mentions the Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long.
* The passage doesn't contain any information about its width.

Therefore, option D is the only statement *not* mentioned in the text.
"
Iza amin'ireo lalan’asa voatonona ao amin'ilay sombin-dahatsoratra no mampiasa Venezoelianina vitsy indrindra?,"The correct answer is **C: Solika (Oil)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Indostria manana ny lanjany ho an’ny Venezueliana ny menaka, ny firenena ny manondrana na dia hoe iray isan-jato ihany no miasa amin’ny indostria."" This translates to ""The oil industry has importance for Venezuelans, but the country exports it even though only one percent works in the industry.""

This indicates that the oil industry has the fewest Venezuelan workers among the options presented. The other options aren't directly quantified in terms of worker percentage in the text."
"Araka ny vosoratra, iza amin'ireto sehatra manaraka ireto no mampiasa Venezoeliana betsaka indrindra?","The correct answer is **D: Solika (Oil)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Indostria manana ny lanjany ho an’ny Venezueliana ny menaka, ny firenena ny manondrana na dia hoe iray isan-jato ihany no miasa amin’ny indostria.""  This translates to: ""The oil industry has importance for Venezuelans, the country exports it even though only one percent works in the industry."" This indicates that the oil industry employs a significant portion of Venezuelans, even if the actual workforce within the industry is relatively small.  This contrasts with the other options, which aren't mentioned in relation to large employment numbers.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no azon’ireo kintana atao amin’ny alalan’ny fiempo?","The correct answer is **A: Mamorona singa mavesatra kokoa**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Mandefa hazavana sy hafanana sy hafanana ny kintana noho ny angovo miforona rehefa mikambana (na mitambatra) ny ataomana hidrozena ka manamboatra singa mavesatra kokoa."" This translates to: ""The stars emit light and heat due to the energy released when hydrogen atoms combine (or fuse) to form heavier elements.""

Therefore, the primary action of stars related to fusion, as described in the text, is the creation of heavier elements.  While the other options are related to fusion in general, they aren't specifically stated as what stars *do* to hydrogen through fusion, according to the text.
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no hoforonin’ny mpamerin-tosika mpanambatra mahasoa?,"The correct answer is **D: Angovo (Energy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that nuclear fusion generates heat and light because heavier elements are formed when hydrogen atoms fuse together. The goal of a fusion reactor is to harness this energy. Therefore, the primary product of a successful fusion reactor would be energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hidirôzena (Hydrogen):** Hydrogen is the fuel used in fusion, not the product.
*   **B: Kintana (Plasma):** Plasma is a state of matter that exists at extremely high temperatures and is present in fusion reactors, but it's not the desired product. It's the *medium* in which the fusion occurs.
*   **C: Atôma (Atoms):** While new atoms are formed, the primary goal is to release energy, not just create new atoms.



"
Inona ireo eva simika mandrafitra ny rano?,"The correct answer is **B: Atôma hidirôzena iray sy atôma ôkisizena iray**.

The passage clearly states: ""Atôman'hidirôzenina roa sy atôman'oksizenina iray no mandrafitra ny taharo simika rano.""  This translates to ""Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom constitute the chemical formula of water.""  Therefore, the correct option is B.
"
"Rehefa miova fiendrika ny rano, inona no tsy hiova?","The correct answer is **A: Firafitry ny môlekiola (Molecular structure)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Na dia mety hiova aza ny toetrany ara-fizika dia tsy miova ny toetrany ara-simika."" (Even though its physical properties may change, its chemical properties do not change.)
* **The passage gives examples:** It uses the examples of hydrogen and oxygen forming water (H2O) to illustrate that the chemical formula and molecular structure remain the same, even when the physical state changes (ice, liquid, gas).
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Hakitroka (Hakitroka - boiling point):** Boiling point is a physical property.
    * **C: Sata fizika (Physical state):** The question asks what *doesn't* change. The passage implies the physical state *does* change (e.g., water can be ice, liquid, or gas).
    * **D: Nitirôzena miranoka (Ice):** This is just one specific physical state of water. The question asks what remains constant *regardless* of the physical state.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy olana ho an'ireo fanjakana telo ambin'ny folo rehefa miezaka mampihatra lalàna sasantsasany?","The correct answer is **A: Fanarahamaso akaiky ataon’ny manampahefam-panjakana.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The Congress has no power to levy taxes...and relies on the executive to enforce it, an executive not particularly keen on cooperation."" This indicates a lack of cooperation from the executive branch.
* **The passage also states:** ""Changes to the confederation required approval from all states, and the larger states often undermined the central government, so delegates were often absent."" This highlights the states' resistance to a strong central government.
* **Option A (Fanarahamaso akaiky ataon’ny manampahefam-panjakana - Close monitoring by state executives) is NOT an issue.** The passage implies the executive branch is *not* cooperating, therefore close monitoring wouldn't be a problem. In fact, the states were actively undermining the central government, so monitoring would be expected.
* **Option B (Ny tsy fahampiam-pahefana ao amin'ny Kôngresy - Lack of power within the Congress) is a major issue.** The passage directly points this out.
* **Option C (Fanitsiana mitaky fankatoavana tsy misy mitsipaka - Amendments requiring unanimous consent) is a major issue.** The passage says changes required approval from all states, which made it very difficult.
* **Option D (Ny tsi-fisian’ny mpanatanteraka nasionaly - Absence of a national executive) is a major issue.** The passage highlights the lack of a strong executive and the executive's unwillingness to cooperate.



Therefore, the only option that is NOT presented as a problem in the text is close monitoring by state executives.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, fanambarana inona no ahitana taratra marina ny toetry ny fitondrana foibe nandritra ny Ady Revolisionera?","The correct answer is **C: Tsy fahatongavan’ny solontenam-panjakana**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...many of the states refused to approve the central government, with the larger states frequently not sending their delegates."" This directly reflects the issue of non-attendance and lack of representation from the states, which hampered the central government's effectiveness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nampiharin’ny Kôngresy sy ny manampahefam-panjakana ireo hetra (The Congress and the state governments reinforced the laws):** The passage explicitly states the opposite - the Congress *couldn't* enforce laws without the cooperation of the state governments.
* **B: Niankina tamin'ny fahefan'ny Kôngresy ny fanitsiana ny andinin-dalàna (The Congress depended on its power to amend the constitution):** The passage indicates the Congress lacked the power to amend the constitution independently; it needed state approval.
* **D: Ahitana sokajy roa lehibe ny governemanta foibe (The central government had two main categories):** The passage doesn't mention any categories of the central government.



"
Voasoratra manao ahoana ireo teny ao ambadiky ny Fanambarana ny Fahaleovantena?,"The correct answer is **D: Amin’ny endri-tsoratra kely** (In small handwriting).

The passage states: ""Io soratra io dia hita eny ambanin’ilay taratasy mivadika"" which translates to ""This writing is seen underneath the folded document.""  And it mentions the document was originally a large sheet that was folded, indicating the writing would be small to fit on the folded portion.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no mampalaza an’i Singapour?,"The correct answer is **A: Zavamaitso an-tanàn-dehibe** (Garden City).

The text explicitly states that the botanical gardens helped transform Singapore into a ""Tanànan-jaridaina traopikaly"" (Tropical Garden City). This is Singapore's well-known nickname.
"
Inona ny Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Voninkazo**.

The text states that Vanda Miss Joaquim is an orchid, and it was chosen as the national flower. Therefore, it is a type of flower (voninkazo in Malagasy).
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona amin’ny kalitaon’ny piramidan’i Gize no tsy noeritreretina ho nahatalanjona an’ireo Egypsianin’ny Fanjakana Vaovao?","The correct answer is **C: Ny habeny (Its size)**.

The passage states that even though pyramids were built for a long time, the Giza pyramids were considered the *largest and best* in terms of technique. The ancient Egyptians were amazed by the pyramids of their ancestors. This implies that the *size* of the Giza pyramids was the most impressive and astonishing aspect.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ny taonany (Their age):** While the age of the pyramids is impressive, the passage doesn't highlight this as the primary reason for awe. The focus is on the construction technique.
* **B: Ny fampiasana ny vato (The use of stone):** The passage mentions the use of stone, but it focuses on the *technique* of building with stone, not just the fact of using stone itself.
* **D: Ny fanamboarana azy ireo (Their construction):** The passage explicitly states that the Giza pyramids had the *best* construction technique. This isn't something surprising to the Egyptians of the New Kingdom; they were already building pyramids.



Therefore, the size of the Giza pyramids was the most astounding aspect to the Egyptians of the New Kingdom.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, avy aiza no mandeha ireo mpihinan-javamaniry manenjika orana?","The correct answer is **C: Ny lemaka atsimo (Southern savanna)**.

The passage states: ""Isan-taona, manodidina ny volana Oktobra, biby mihinana ahitra eo amin’ny 1,5 tapitrisa eo no mankany any amin’ireo tany lemaka any atsimo..."" which translates to ""Annually, around October, about 1.5 million herbivores go to the southern savanna...""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, avy aiza no iaingan’ireo mpihinan-javamaniry manodidina ny volana aprily indraindray?","The correct answer is **C: Ny reniranon’i Mara**.

The text states: ""Ao amin’ny faritry ny Serengeti no misy ny Valan-java-boaary Nasionalin’i Serengeti, ny vala tahirin’i Ngorongoro ary ny saha fihazan’i Maswa any Tanzania sy ny saha Tahiry Nasionalin’i Maasai Mara any Kenia. **Ao amin’ny faritra Serengeti no misy ny vala, ary niverina avy any avaratra nakany andrefana avy eo, ary niampita ny renirano Mara indray avy eo, tao aorian’ny orana manodidina ny volana Aprily.**"" This indicates they crossed the Mara River again after the rains around April.
"
Fanafihana ny firenena iza ny Hetsika Lion-dranomasina?,"The correct answer is **A: Alemaina**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nantsoin’i Alemainina tamin’ny anarana miafina hoe “Hetsika Sealion” ny fanafihana."" This translates to ""The invasion was secretly called 'Operation Sealion' by the Germans.""
"
Inona no niantsoan’i Alemaina ny fanafihana an’i Bretaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Hetsika Lion-dranomasina**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nantsoin’i Alemainina tamin’ny anarana miafina hoe “Hetsika Sealion” ny fanafihana.""  This translates to ""The Germans called the invasion the ""Sealion Operation"".""
"
Inona no tsy voalaza fa dingana ilaina amin’ny drafitr’i Italia hambabo ny firenena Afrikanina?,"The correct answer is **C: Mametraka vondron-tafika mandeha amin’ny fivoy (Deploy a naval fleet)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Italy needs to deploy troops to Africa via the Mediterranean Sea. 
* To do this, they need a naval fleet to transport and support those troops. 
* While destroying British ships (D) is helpful, it's not the primary *deployment* action needed.
* Building more ships (B) is a supporting action, but not a necessary step *before* deploying a fleet.
* Destroying ships in Egypt (A) is a tactic to clear the way, but not a fundamental step in deploying the fleet.

Therefore, deploying a naval fleet (C) is the most crucial and unstated step required for Italy to achieve its goal of conquering African nations.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no heverina fa tanjona lohalaharan’i Italia tamin’ny ady?","The correct answer is **A: Mambabo firenena Afrikana**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tanjon’I Italia amin’ny ankapobeny dia ireo firenena Afrikanina."" (The general goal of Italy is African countries.) While the passage mentions destroying British ships in Egypt as a means to achieve this goal, the overarching objective is the subjugation of African nations.
"
Iza no nametraka fifandraisana ara-pirahalahiana tamin’ny mpanani-bohitra?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny frantsay Vichyste**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ireo dia vahoaka Frantsay izay niombona tamin’ny Alemà tamin'ny 1940 ary niara-niasa tamin’ireo mpanafika fa tsy niady tamin’izy ireo.""  This translates to: ""These were French people who joined the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers but did not fight them.""  This clearly identifies the Vichy French as collaborating with the Germans.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ny Alemana** - The Germans were the occupiers, not those who established a fraternal relationship.
*   **C: Ny amerikana** - The Americans were the ones who liberated southern France.
*   **D: Ny frantsay afaka** - The Free French fought against the Germans.



"
Iza ireo mpiara-dia tafiditra amin’ny hetsika Dragona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny Amerikana sy ny frantsay afaka**.

The text states: ""Tamin’ny 15 Aogositra 1940, ny Mpiray Dina dia nanafika ny atsimon’i Frantsa, “Operation Dragona” no nilazana izany fanafihana izany. Tamin’ny roa herinandro monja no namahan’ny Amerikanina sy ny tafika Frantsay Afaka ny faritra atsimon’i Frantsa..."" 

This clearly indicates that the Americans and Free French forces participated in Operation Dragoon.
"
Fampandrosoana ny teknolojia inona no nahatonga ireo sambo mpisitrika handeha ambanin’ny ranomasina?,"The correct answer is **D: Radara**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tany am-piandohan’ny ady dia teny ambony ranomasina no tena lalany, fa noho ny nanomboka nivoatra ny radara no sady niha marina tsara dia tsy maintsy nandeha tao ambanin’ny rano ny sambo mpisitrika mba tsy ho hita."" (Initially, their main route was on the surface of the sea, but because radar technology became more sophisticated, U-boats had to travel underwater to avoid detection.)

This clearly links the development of radar to the need for U-boats to operate underwater.
"
"Nandritra ny fampiasana azy voalohany, amin’ny sehatra aiza no voafetra tanteraka ny sambo mpisitrika?","The correct answer is **C: Fitifirana**.

The text states: ""Tamin’izany dia niadana be izy ireny no sady voafetra ny fahafahany mitifitra."" (At that time, they were very slow and their ability to fire was limited.) This directly indicates that the firing capability of the U-boats was severely restricted.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no nanitsakitsaka fifanekena? ","The correct answer is **D: Ny Sovietika**.

The text states that the Soviet Red Army invaded eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression treaty, and other international agreements. This indicates that the Soviet Union was the party that violated these agreements.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy notontosain’ny Tafika Mena?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny fanitsakitsahana ny fifanarahana (The revision of the treaties)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Soviet invasion violated several treaties, including the Riga Peace Treaty and the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The Soviets *implemented* their violation by invading and occupying eastern Poland.  The question asks what they *didn't* do. While they violated treaties by invading (B), establishing a presence in Ukraine (A), and re-establishing strategic territories (C), the passage doesn't suggest they attempted to *revise* those treaties. Their actions were a direct violation, not an attempt to renegotiate them.
"
Inona no nitranga tamin’ny Lehiben’ny Injenieran’ny Tafika Fahafolo Italianina?,"The correct answer is **C: Voasambotry ny Britanika izy**.

The passage states: ""Tao anatin’ny fandrika tany amin’ny atsinan’i Bardia, dia voasambotr’ireo anglisy ny injeniera sefo ny tafika faha folo ny Italiana, Jeneraly Lastucci."" This translates to: ""In the fighting east of Bardia, the British captured the Chief Engineer of the Tenth Italian Army, General Lastucci.""

Therefore, option C is the accurate description of what happened to General Lastucci.
"
Taiza no maty voatifitra i Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The passage states: ""Tamin’ny 28 Jona, ny Maréchal Italo Balbo, Governora Jeneralin’i Libia ary mpandovan’i Mussolini, dia maty nohon’ny tifitra avy amin’ny namany rehefa nigadona teo **Tobruk**."" which translates to ""On June 28th, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and Mussolini's ally, died from a gunshot from his own men upon arriving in **Tobruk**.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto teknika manaraka ireto no ampahany manan-danja amin’ny fieritreretana lalina Tibetanina?","The correct answer is **C: Mijery ireo andriamanitra**.

The text explicitly states: ""The focus of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are stimulated, the chakras work, and spiritual awareness is formed.""

While options A, B, and D are mentioned as part of Kundalini Yoga (which influences Tibetan Buddhism), the text highlights Deity Yoga and visualization of deities as the *core* of Tibetan meditation. Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, ahoana no amelomana an’ireo chakra mandritra ny ivon’ny fieritreretana lalina Tibetanina?","The correct answer is **B: Amin’ny fijerena ireo andriamanitra (By looking at the deities)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Rehefa maka sary an-tsaina ny andriamanitra samihafa dia voadio ny fantson’angovo, miasa ny chakras ary miforona ny fahatsiarovantena amin’ny fahazavana ara-panahy.""  This translates to: ""When visualizing various deities, the energy channels are stimulated, the chakras work, and spiritual awareness is formed.""

Therefore, the visualization of deities is the method used to activate the chakras in Tibetan meditation.
"
Iza no manolotra ny hira fanajana lehibe faharoa mandritra ny fotoana?,"The correct answer is **B: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Nanolotra ny chhappan bhog bhajan ihany koa i Lakkha Singh."" This translates to ""Lakkha Singh also offered the chhappan bhog bhajan.""  This implies he was one of the main performers and therefore offered a significant portion of the devotional singing.  While Sanju Sharma and Jai Shankar Choudhary also performed, Lakkha Singh is specifically mentioned as offering the *chhappan bhog bhajan*.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no manolotra hira fanompoana mandritra ny fanolorana sakafo?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Nanolotra ny chhappan bhog bhajan ihany koa i Lakkha Singh."" This translates to ""Lakkha Singh also offered the chhappan bhog bhajan."" Therefore, Lakkha Singh is the one who offered the devotional songs during the offering of food.
"
Inona no fampisehoana tapany faharoa farany amin’ny takariva?,"The correct answer is **B: Afon’i Anatolie**.

The text states: ""Ho famaranana, ny tarika mpandiha Tiorka Fire of Anatolia dia nanao ny seho “Troy”.""  This means the final performance was ""Troy"" by the Turkish dance troupe Fire of Anatolia, which is related to Anatolia.  While Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou performed, they were not the final act.
"
Mizaka zom-pirenena inona i Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Italiana**.

The text states that Alessandro Safina is an ""italiana"" (Italian) singer.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no tsy marina?","The correct answer is **B: Tafahitsoka tambonin’ny lamasinina miaka-midina ny olona** (People got stuck on the roller coaster).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""A passenger experienced a steam leak on the waiting line at 90 degrees (F)."" This confirms the passenger experienced a steam leak (which is related to the heat, but not getting stuck).
* **The text states:** ""...it took at least an hour to evacuate the first person on that line."" This confirms that at least an hour was spent evacuating someone.
* **The text mentions:** ""It was hot in Santa Clara, with temperatures in the 90s."" This confirms it was a hot day.
* **The text mentions:** ""The wait time on the roller coaster was not a breeze, and it took at least an hour to evacuate the first person on that line."" This implies a significant delay, likely due to the steam leak.

**None of the information in the text suggests that people got stuck on the roller coaster.** Option B is not supported by the provided information.  The steam leak caused a delay in evacuation, but not necessarily people getting trapped.

Therefore, **B is the false statement.**
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no naneho hevitra momba ny haavon’ny hafanana tsy ahazoana aina?","The correct answer is **B: Ny kapitenin’ny mpamonjy voina**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ny kapitenin’ny mpamonjy voina Scott Kouns: “Tena nafana ny andro tao Santa Clara, niaraka tamin’ny maripana tany amin’ny 90 tany ho any.”""  This clearly indicates that Captain Scott Kouns is the one expressing the opinion about the unbearable heat.
"
Taiza no nisy fahatapahan’ny herinaratra noho ny tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The passage states: ""Nisy trangana tsunami hita mazava voarakitra tao akaikin'i Pago Pago sy Niue. Tsy nisy ny fahasimbana be na ny olona naratra tao **Tonga** raha ny tatitra..."" (There were clear tsunami traces recorded near Pago Pago and Niue. There was not much damage or people injured in **Tonga** according to reports...)

While the other options mention locations affected by the tsunami, the question specifically asks where there was a disruption of power. The passage explicitly states that Tonga experienced no major damage or injuries.  The school closures in Hawaii were preventative measures due to potential threat, not a result of power disruption.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, nanao ahoana ny fiantrakan’ny fahatapahan-jiro tamin’i Tonga?","The correct answer is **D: Tsy mety naharay fampitandremana mazava ny manampahefana.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...the Tongan authorities apparently did not receive the tsunami warning issued by the PTWC.""

This directly addresses the impact of the school closures in Tonga. Options A, B, and C are not supported by the text.
"
Tamin’ny fotoana inona ny polisy no afaka nampiasa ny basin-dradarany hamantaranandro ny hafainganam-pandehan’i Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **C: Rehefa nihoatra ny 160km isan’ora ny familiny**.

The text states: ""Sahirana ny polisy tao Nouvelle Zélande nampiasa ireo radara hahitana ny hafainganam-pandehan’i Atoa Reid satria ambany loatra ny hafainganan’i Black Beauty, ary ny fotoana tokany nahavitan’izy ireo izany dia rehefa nandeha 160km/ora i Atoa Reid."" This means the police used radar to detect his speed *when he was traveling over 160 km/h*.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, nahoana no sarotra ho an’ny polisin’i Novely Zelandy ny mandrefy ny hafainganam-pandehan’i Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: Latsaky ny 160km isan’ora ny familiny** (His speed was less than 160 km/h).

The text states that the police used radar to catch Jonny Reid speeding, but his car, ""Black Beauty,"" was travelling *slower* than 160 km/h.  The radar was set to detect speeds above that, so he was caught because he was going slower than expected.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iva loatra ny fiara** (The car was too big) -  The size of the car is not mentioned as a factor.
* **C: Impito ihany izy no nitondra ambony tetezana** (He only drove on the bridge seven times) - The number of times he drove on the bridge is irrelevant to the police's difficulty in detecting his speed.
* **D: Antitra loatra ny Tetezan’i Auckland Harbour** (Auckland Harbour Bridge is too old) -  The age of the bridge is not related to the situation.



"
Taiza no nisy ny ivon’ny fihovitrovitry ny tany nahakasika an’i Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 maily atsimo**.

The passage states: ""any ho any amin’ny 65 km (40 miles) atsimon’i Butte ny ivon’ilay horohorontany.""  40 miles south is the same as 40 miles atsimo."
Inona no nitranga nandritra ny rotaka tao Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Fanimbazimbana ny mpiray efitra-figadrana**

The question asks what happened *during* the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.  The scandal revolved around the abuse and mistreatment of prisoners, including sexual abuse, by American soldiers. While the prison was eventually shut down, the core of the scandal was the abuse that occurred *while it was operating*.  The other options are not directly related to the events that defined the Abu Ghraib scandal.
"
Nahoana no nahazo laza ny fonja irakianina? ,"The correct answer is **B: Nofehezin’ny tafik’i Etazonia**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *why* the Abu Ghraib prison gained notoriety.
* The provided text states the prison became infamous after the US military took control, following allegations of abuse. This directly points to the US military being responsible for the events that led to the prison's negative reputation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: May nisy nandoro (Someone may have died)** - While deaths may have occurred, the core reason for notoriety was the abuse itself, not necessarily the deaths themselves.
* **C: Maro ny rotaka tao (There were many riots inside)** - While there may have been riots, the primary reason for Abu Ghraib's infamy was the systematic abuse of prisoners.
* **D: Ny fahitana ny fanimbazimbana ireo migadra (Seeing the torture of the criminals)** - This is a consequence of the abuse, but not the root cause of the prison gaining notoriety. The notoriety stemmed from the US military's actions.



"
Inona ny karazan-danonana ilaina tontosaina ao amin’ny Kianjam-pahatsiarovana ny Ady ao Maui?,"The text states that a performance was supposed to take place at Maui's War Memorial Stadium, which would have held 9000 people. This implies the stadium is suitable for large events like **A: Fampisehoana hakinga-tanana (Concerts)**.

The other options are less likely:

*   **B: Lalao baolina kitra (Soccer games)**: While a stadium *could* host soccer games, the text doesn't provide any indication of that.
*   **C: Rindrankira (Golf)**:  Stadia are not typically designed for golf.
*   **D: Fanangonam-bola (Fundraisers)**: While a performance *could* be part of a fundraiser, the core event is the performance itself.



Therefore, the best answer is **A: Fampisehoana hakinga-tanana**."
Iza avy eo no nanome fanazavana antsipiriany amin’ny fanafoanana ny lanonana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny orinasam-pitantanana**.

The text states: ""Ny orinasam-fitantanana ny vondrona, HK Management Inc., dia tsy nanome ilay antony voalohany rehefa nofoanany ny 20 Septambra..."" (The group management company, HK Management Inc., did not provide the first reason when it canceled on September 20th...).

Therefore, HK Management Inc. (the group management company) provided the explanation.
"
Iza no heverin’ny mponin’i Bishkek maro ho tompon’andraikitra tamin’ny fandrobana?,"The answer is **A: Ireo manamboninahitra mpampihatra lalàna**.

The text states: ""Nanome tsiny ireo mpanohitra avy any atsimo ny mponina maro tao Bishkek noho ny tsy fanarahan’izy ireo lalàna.""  This translates to: ""Many residents of Bishkek blamed the southerners for not following the law.""  Since the southerners are referred to as ""mpanao fihetsiketsehana"" (protesters/rioters), the implication is that the residents are blaming the **law enforcement officials** for not controlling the situation and allowing the riots (and subsequent looting) to occur.  Therefore, the residents are indirectly blaming the law enforcement for the looting.



While the other options *could* be involved in the looting, the text directly links the blame to the southerners' failure to follow the law.  This makes the law enforcement (presumably responsible for upholding the law) the most logical answer.

**Therefore, A is the best fit.**
"
Iza no niampanga ny mpanao fihetsiketsehana avy any atsimo noho ny fandrobana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny mponin’i Bishkek** (The residents of Bishkek).

The text explicitly states: ""Mpandinika iray no namaritra an’i Bishkek ho mihamilentika anaty """"gaboraraka"""", satria nisy andian’olona nirenireny teny an-dalana ary nandroba ireo fivarotana entam-barotra. Nanome tsiny ireo mpanohitra avy any atsimo ny mponina maro tao Bishkek noho ny tsy fanarahan’izy ireo lalàna."" (One analyst described Bishkek as ""swirling in chaos"" because there was a group of people rioting in the streets and looting shops. Many residents of Bishkek blamed the southern protesters for their disregard of the law.)
"
Oviana ny Ring no niaina fitomboan’ny varotra?,"The correct answer is **A: Taorian’ny fisehoana tao amin’ny Shark Tank**.

The text explicitly states: ""Izy dia nanome tamin’ny Shark Tank iray tamin’ny 2013 izay nandavan’ny vaomieran’ny fandaharana ny hamatsy vola an’ilay orinasa vao misandratra. Nilaza i Siminoff fa niakatra ny varotra taorian’ny fisehoany tanatina fizarana Shark Tank iray tamin’ny 2013..."" This clearly indicates that the sales increased *after* the Shark Tank appearance.
"
Oviana i Jamie Siminoff no nanapa-kevitra hanomboka ny Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Taorian’ny fahitana fa tsy mety ny lakolosy fanairan’ny varavarany**.

The text states: ""Teo aloha teo, ny Filoha Tale Jeneralin'ny Ring, Jamie Siminoff, dia nanamarika fa teraka ilay orinasa rehefa tsy reny avy tao amin’ny fivarotany tao amin'ny garaziny ny lakolosim-baravarany. Izy dia nanamboatra lakolosim-baravarana misy WiFi..."" This indicates he started Ring because he saw a need for a better front door security solution for his own home.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rehefa tsy nahomby ny fisehoana tao amin’ny Shark Tank:** The text says the Shark Tank appearance *increased* sales, even though the company didn't get funding.
* **C: Taorian’ny famoriam-bola:** The text doesn't mention receiving funding before starting Ring.
* **D: Taorian’ny fisehoana mahomby tao amin’ny QVC:** The QVC appearance happened later, in 2017.
"
Nandrisika ny ankizy tolo-kevitra momba ny inona ny fizarana tsirairay amin’ny Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **D: Boky**.

The passage states: ""Each episode of the program focuses on a single topic within one book in particular and explores that topic through multiple stories. The show also highlights books that children should read when visiting the library."" This clearly indicates that each episode revolves around a specific book.
"
Inona no mety nahatonga ny fanafoanana ny andian-tantara Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **A: Tsy ampy vatsy fanohanana (Lack of funding)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Misy sasany mino, anisan’izany i John Grant, fa samy nahatonga ny famaranana ilay tantara mitohy ny olana teo amin'ny famatsiam-bola sy ny fiovàn'ny filôzôfian'ireo fandaharana amin'ny fahitalavitra fanabeazana."" This translates to: ""Some people believe, including John Grant, that the end of the story continues with the ongoing problem of funding and the changing philosophy of educational television programs.""

While the other options might be related to the show, they are not directly mentioned as causes for its cancellation. The lack of funding is the problem specifically cited in the text.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy tohan-kevitra nataon’ny manampahefana tao Amsterdam sy ny mozea mikasika ny hazo?,"The correct answer is **C: Voaloton’ny holatra izany (It is a design feature)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the *opposite* of the authorities' opinion.** The authorities believe the tree is diseased and a health hazard, potentially falling and causing injury. 
* **Option A (It is inevitable that it will fall):** This aligns with the authorities' concerns about the tree's health.
* **Option B (It should be preserved):** This also aligns with a potential counter-argument against the authorities' decision, suggesting preservation is desirable.
* **Option D (It is a danger to public health):** This directly reflects the authorities' statement.
* **Option C (It is a design feature):**  This is the *opposite* of the authorities' concern about the tree's health. It suggests the tree's appearance or placement is intentionally part of the design, implying it's not a problem to be fixed.

Therefore, the only option that doesn't reflect the authorities' perspective is that the tree is a design feature."
"Araka ny filazan'ny lehiben'ny mpanaramaso ny RSPCA, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tokony hanara-penitra ny fanarahamaso?","The correct answer is **A: Fakan-tsary CCTV**. 

The text states that Animal Liberation and RSPCA are requesting CCTV cameras in Australian animal shelters. David O’Shannessy, the Chief Inspector at RSPCA New South Wales, says that CCTV should be standard practice for monitoring laboratories. 

Therefore, the focus is on the **CCTV cameras** themselves, which are the tools used for monitoring. While the cameras are for monitoring the shelters, the question asks *what should be monitored*, and the answer is the CCTV footage itself."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mety hanampy amin'ny fanamafisana ny maha-zava-dehibe ny fiahiana biby eo amin’ireo mpiasan'ny labatoara aostraliana?","The correct answer is **A: Fametrahana fakan-tsary CCTV (Installing CCTV cameras)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Animal Liberation and RSPCA are requesting CCTV cameras in Australian animal shelters. David O'Shannessy, the Chief Inspector at RSPCA New South Wales, says CCTV is ""standard practice"" and would send a strong message to animal abusers.

While the other options might contribute to animal welfare, the passage directly links CCTV installation to reinforcing the importance of animal care in Australian laboratories.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no asan’ilay olona voasambotra?","The correct answer is **A: Mpianatra**.

The text states that one other student was arrested in connection with the school shooting.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, raha niely ny vaovao momba ny fisamborana iray hafa, firy ireo niharam-boina nanaovana fandevenana?","The correct answer is **B: Telo**.

The text states: ""Niparitaka eo anivon’ny fiarahamonina Red Lake ny vaovao androany rehefa natao ny fandevenana an’i Jeff Weise sy olona telo amin’ireo sivy niharam-boina...""

This translates to: ""News spread in the Red Lake community today when a warrant was issued for Jeff Weise and three other people among the nine victims...""

Therefore, three people (besides Jeff Weise) had warrants issued for them.
"
"Ho setrin'ny fihetsiketsehana, iza no firenena tsy nandroso tamin'ny fifanarahana ACTA nosoniaviny?","The correct answer is **B: Pôlônina**.

The passage states: ""Tamin’ny volana lasa dia nisy hetsipanoherana be dia be tao Polonina rehefa nanasonia ny ACTA io firenena io, izay nahatonga ny governementa poloney nanapa-kevitra ny tsy hanasonia fifanarahana mihitsy aloha amin’izao.""  This directly translates to: ""Last month there were many protests in Poland when it was to ratify ACTA, which led the Polish government to decide not to ratify the agreement at all.""

Therefore, Poland is the country that did not move forward with ratifying the ACTA agreement.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto firenena manaraka ireto no nanapa-kevitra hanemotra ny dingana fidirana amin'ny ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Letonia**.

The text states: ""Samy nampihemotra ny fotoana hidirana amin’ny ACTA i Letônia sy Slovakia."" which translates to ""Both Latvia and Slovakia delayed the entry into ACTA.""
"
Firy ny olona naratra vokatry ny loza fihoaran-kafanan’ny iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The question asks how many people suffered burns as a result of the iPod overheating issue. The text states: ""...and caused minor burns to four people.""
"
Iza no nilaza fa tsy dia lehibe loatra ny loza fihoaran-kafanana?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The passage states: ""Ny herinandro lasa teo, ny METI dia nanambara fa nampahafantatra azy trangana fitomboan’ny hafanana be loatra miisa 34 fanampiny i Apple, izay nolazain’ny orinasa fa “tsy misy atahorana.”""  This translates to: ""Last week, the METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company stated were ""not a concern.""""
"
"Nandritra ny fandraisam-pitenenany, inona no nolazain'i Steve Jobs fa hoforonin’ny Apple indray?","The correct answer is **B: Ny finday (The phone)**.

The text states, ""Hanavao ny finday i Apple anio..."" which translates to ""Apple will innovate the phone today...""

While the other options are related, the text specifically mentions the **phone** that Apple would innovate.
"
Inona no tanjon'ny fandraisam-pitenenan’i Steve Jobs izay naharitra adiny roa?,"The correct answer is **C: Hamoaka finday vaovao**.

The question states that Steve Jobs announced the iPhone and said, ""Today, Apple is reinventing the phone, today we are rewriting the history of the phone."" This clearly indicates he was announcing a new phone.
"
Inona no fanambarana nataon'i Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner tao amin'ny Teatra Arzantina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny firotsahany hofidiana ho filoham-pirenena** (Her intention to run for president).

The question states that Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her intention to run for president. Option A accurately reflects this.
"
Taiza no nanambaran’i Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ny fikasany hirotsaka hofidiana?,"The correct answer is **C: Tao amin'ny Teatra Arzantina 31 maily miala an'i Buenos Aires**.

Here's why:

* The question states that the announcement was made in the **Argentine Theatre** and that it's **50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.**
* Option C accurately reflects both of those details.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tao amin'ny teatra 31 maily miala an'i La Plata** - This is partially correct about the distance but incorrect about the name of the theatre.
* **B: Tao amin'ny teatra Buenos Aires ao La Plata** - This is incorrect; the announcement was in the Argentine Theatre, not a Buenos Aires theatre *in* La Plata.
* **D: Tao amin'ny teatra La Plata any Buenos Aires** - This is incorrect; La Plata is a separate city from Buenos Aires.

"
Inona no voka-pikarohana hitan'ny ACMA momba ny Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **D: Hita maso nipetraka tao amin'ny lohamilina iray ny votoaty (Found the content hosted on a server)**.

The provided text states: ""Hitan’ny ACMA fa na dia niparitaka be tamin’ny aterineto ary ilay rakin-tsary dia tsy nandika lalàna an-jotra i Zoky Be satria tsy tao amin’ny tranonkalany no nisyan’ilay izy.""  This means the ACMA found the video content *hosted on a server* (lohamilina iray).

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsy voahitsakitsaka ny lalàna momba ny sivana (Did not violate the broadcasting law):** The text says the video didn't violate broadcasting laws *because it wasn't on his own server*.  So this is the opposite of what the text states.
* **B: Hita fa voatahiry ao amin'ny tranokalan'ny Big Brother ny haino vaky jery (Found that the video was hosted on the Big Brother's server):** The text *explicitly says* the video wasn't on the Big Brother's server.
* **C: Voahitsakitsaka ny lalàna momba ny sivana (Violated the broadcasting law):** The text indicates it *didn't* violate the broadcasting law.



"
Inona avy ireo mpihazaka tsy maintsy hajain’ny haino vaky jery mba ho raisina ho votoaty amin'ny aterineto?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsy maintsy mipetraka hita maso amin’ny lohamilina iray izany (Must be hosted on a server)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mieritreritra ny hifehy ny votoaty anaty Aterineto ny Lalàna momba ny Sampana Fampitam-baovao, kanefa mba handraisana izany ho votoaty anaty Aterineto dia tsy maintsy mitoetra anatinà lohamilina izy.""  This translates to: ""The Law on Information Ethics aims to control online content, but in order for it to be considered online content, it must reside on a server.""

Therefore, the content needs to be hosted on a server (a ""lohamilina"" in Malagasy) to be considered online content and subject to the law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tsy maintsy alefa mivantana amin'ny aterineto izany (Must be uploaded directly to the internet):**  While uploading is part of the process, the key is *where* it's hosted.
*   **C: Tsy azo tehirizina amin'ny tranonkala izany (Cannot be stored on a website):** The passage doesn't say it *cannot* be stored on a website, just that it needs to be on a *server*.  A website *is* a type of server.
*   **D: Tsy maintsy ankatoavin'ny ACMA izany (Must be approved by the ACMA):** The passage doesn't mention ACMA approval as a requirement for online content.



"
Iza no mpitarika ny Antoko Liberaly ao Aostralia?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text states: ""...olona eritreretina handimby ny Praiminisitra John Howard ao amin’ny fitarihana ny antoko Liberaly."" This means Peter Costello was considered a potential successor to John Howard as leader of the Liberal Party. While John Howard was the Prime Minister at the time, the question asks who is the leader of the Liberal Party, and the text identifies Peter Costello in that role."
Nahoana no tsy mbola manana indostrian'ny angovo nokleary i Aostralia?,"The correct answer is **A: Tsy fahampian’ny fanohanam-bahoaka (Lack of public support)**.

The text states that Peter Costello said Australia should continue using nuclear power *if* it's commercially viable and there's no public opposition. This implies that a lack of public support is a significant hurdle.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely based on the text:

*   **B: Mampiady hevitra be loatra (Too much debate):** While debate might exist, the text doesn't highlight this as the primary reason.
*   **C: Mampidi-doza be loatra (Too dangerous):** Costello's statement suggests he believes nuclear power can be used safely if it's commercially viable.
*   **D: Lafo be loatra (Too expensive):** Costello mentions commercial viability, which implies cost is a factor, but not the *primary* reason for the lack of an industry.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion, based on the information given, is that **lack of public support** is a key factor preventing the development of a nuclear power industry in Australia."
Iza amin'ireo mpikorisa an-dranomandry no nifaninana nila fanampian'ny mpitari-dalana?,"The answer is **D: Anna Ogarzynska**.

The text states ""...ilay mpisava lalana Anna Ogarzynska...""  ""Mpisava lalana"" translates to ""slalom skier"". Slalom skiers require guidance from course marshals.

The other options are:
* Anna Jochemsen: Super-G skier.
* Jong Seork Park: Super-G skier.
* Maciej Krezel: Super-G skier.



"
Iza no firenena nahazo laharana fahafolo tamin'ny Super-G ho an'ny sokajy mitsangana vehivavy?,"The correct answer is **A: Finlandy**.

The text states: ""I Finlandy izay nisy an’I Katja Saarinen izay fahafolo tamin’io taranja io ihany."" which translates to ""In Finland, there was Katja Saarinen who was tenth in that same sport."" The sport being referred to is Super-G for women.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona ny fanambarana tsy marina momba an'i Blake?","The correct answer is **B: Niaiky ny fanafihana izy**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The defendant who was arrested for the assault denied the attack and claimed he used pepper spray to defend himself from a bottle thrown by someone over thirty."" This means Blake *denied* the attack, not that he confessed to it.
* **The passage states:** ""...Blake was charged with contempt of court.""  This indicates he was charged with something other than confessing to the assault.
* **The passage states:** ""...he claimed he used pepper spray..."" This directly contradicts option C, which says he used a ""kibay"" (which is a different type of spray than pepper spray).
* **The passage doesn't mention:** that he was arrested in the field (A) or that he was injured by a bottle (D).

Therefore, the only inaccurate statement about Blake is that he *admitted* to the assault.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy nahazo an'i Blake?","The correct answer is **C: Notafihina tamin’ny kibay izy** (He was not threatened with a baseball bat).

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** ""The defendant who was arrested for the offering claimed he used a taser to protect himself from the bottle thrown by a man over thirty."" This tells us someone threw a bottle, but it doesn't say Blake was threatened with a baseball bat.
*   **The text states:** ""Blake was also charged with contempt of court.""
*   **The text states:** ""The judge told Blake that “imprisonment is almost inevitable.”""
*   **The text states:** ""The trial was held at the Birmingham Crown Court and ended on August 3rd.""
*  **The text states**: ""The defendant who was arrested for the offering claimed he used a taser to protect himself from the bottle thrown by a man over thirty.""

Therefore, the only option that is *not* mentioned in the text as happening to Blake is being threatened with a baseball bat.



"
Inona no tsy hampiasana ny tahirim-bolan'ny ONU momba ny fiakaran'ny maripàna?,"The correct answer is **D: Fanalefahana ny vokatry ny fiakaran'ny maripanan'ny tany (Mitabolava ny vokany)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the UN is planning to provide funding for:

*   **Saving remaining forests:** This relates to mitigating climate change impacts.
*   **Sharing technology for sustainable development:** This supports developing nations in environmentally friendly ways.
*   **Helping vulnerable countries adapt to climate change impacts:** This includes funding for things like building flood-resistant houses, improving water management, and enhancing crop diversity.

Option D, ""Fanalefahana ny vokatry ny fiakaran'ny maripanan'ny tany,""  translates to ""Mitabolava ny vokany"" in the context of the passage. While adapting to the consequences of climate change is mentioned (building flood-resistant houses, etc.), the passage doesn't mention the UN using funds to *mitigate* the effects of sea-level rise (like building seawalls or other protective measures). The focus is on *adapting* to the impacts, not preventing them.



Therefore, the UN's funding is not specifically directed towards mitigating the effects of sea-level rise.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no antenain’ny ONU hovonjena?","The correct answer is **C: Ala mando sisa tavela**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tafiditra ao anatin’ny fandaharam-potoana ao Bali ny lohahevitra sasany tahaka ny **famonjena ireo ala sisa tavela manerantany**..."" (Some topics will be included in the Bali agenda, such as the **saving of the remaining forests...**).

While the passage mentions other things the UN hopes to achieve (technology transfer, climate change assistance, etc.), the question specifically asks what the UN hopes to *save*.  The passage clearly links that to the remaining forests.
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy notononin'i Albert Muchanga ho zavatra mbola mila ifanarahana?,"The correct answer is **C: Fitsipika matoany (Standards)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tsy mbola nifanaraka mahakasika ny **fitsipika mifehy ny fiavian’ny entana sy ny haba** izahay..."" which translates to ""We have not yet agreed on **standards and quantity control**...""

While the other options are mentioned in the context of AfCFTA, the text clearly identifies standards as an outstanding issue.

* **A: Raha te-hanatevin-daharana ny AfCTA i Bénin (Benin's desire to follow the AfCFTA roadmap):**  This is implied as the discussion is about Benin joining AfCFTA.
* **B: Ny daty mety hanombohan'ny varotra (The possible start date of trade):** The text mentions a potential start date (July 1, 2020) as a future target.
* **D: Fileferam-bidy (Tariffs):**  Tariffs aren't explicitly mentioned as an issue needing agreement in this excerpt.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, nahoana no afaka manomboka amin'ny volana Jolay ny varotra?","The correct answer is **B: Ampy ny lasitrasa fitsipika sy ny fifanekena fileferana mipetraka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tsy mbola nifanaraka mahakasika ny fitsipika mifehy ny fiavian’ny entana sy ny haba izahay, fa ny drafitra anananay dia ampy anombohana ny fifanakalozana ara-barotra ny 1 Jolay 2020.""  This translates to: ""We have not yet agreed on regulations governing the origin and quantity of goods, but the framework we have is sufficient to begin trade on July 1, 2020.""

This implies that although full agreement wasn't reached on *all* regulations, there *was* enough of a framework in place to allow trade to commence.  The ""lasitrasa fitsipika sy ny fifanekena fileferana mipetraka"" (existing regulations and agreed-upon framework) is what made the start of trade possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Anisan'ny fepetran'i Nizeria hidirana amin'ny AfCFTA ny daty manomboka volana Jolay** - While Nigeria's intention is relevant, it doesn't explain *why* trade can start in July.
* **C: Nankatoavin'ny kaomisera misahana ny varotra sy ny indostria ao amin’ny Vondrona Afrikana izany** - The commissioner's support is noted, but the text highlights the framework as the enabling factor, not just the commissioner's approval.
* **D: Nifanarahana ny fitsipika niaviana sy ny fifanekena fileferam-bidy** -  The text explicitly states they *haven't* fully agreed on origin and quantity regulations. This makes this option incorrect.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no niampangan'ny Atlanta Journal-Constitution an’ireo manam-pahefana mpiandraikitra fanabeazana?","The correct answer is **C: Tsy mihetsika amin'ny olana anatiny efa fantatra.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a report highlighting the issues within the school system *after* problems were discovered. It specifically says the report indicated that while the school system acknowledged problems, they *didn't follow through* on addressing them.  This directly corresponds to option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fanaovana hosoka ny tatitry ny Journal-Constitution:** The Journal-Constitution *published* the report, not attempted to falsify it.
* **B: Tsy nahavita nanavao ny fanabeazana an-tanàn-dehibe:**  While the passage mentions Hall was initially known for improving education, the core issue raised by the newspaper wasn't a general lack of improvement, but a failure to address *existing* problems.
* **D: Fitaterana naotim-panadinana ambany:** The passage mentions tests being falsified, but doesn't state that this was done by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.



"
"Araka ny fampahalalana nomena ao amin'ny ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy voalaza ao amin'ny tatitry ny Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **C: Mpandresy tamin’ny Mpiandraikitra Nasionaly ny taona 2013**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Hall was *awarded* the National Teacher of the Year in 2009.
* The Atlanta Journal-Constitution article *revealed* problems with test scores and mentioned test manipulation.
* The passage explicitly states that Hall and 34 other education leaders were *charged* in 2013.

Therefore, the article did not state that Hall was awarded a national prize in 2013. The other options are mentioned within the text.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, fampahalalana inona no fantatra taorian'ny daroka baomba?","The correct answer is **D: Ny isan’ny maty ofisialy**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ny tatitra ofisialy dia manamarina fa hatramin’ny 30 ireo naratra..."" (Official reports confirm that up to 30 people were injured...). This indicates that the official number of deaths is mentioned.
* **The passage mentions:** ""Baomba iray no nipoaka tao ivelan’ny biraon’ny governora jeneraly."" (One bomb exploded outside the governor-general's office.) and ""Bomba telo indray no nipoaka akaikin’ny toeram-piasam-panjakana."" (Three more bombs exploded near the government building.) This confirms the locations of the explosions.
* **The passage mentions:** ""Ny tatitra sasany dia milaza fa 8 no isa ofisialin’ireo maty..."" (Some reports say that 8 people were officially dead...). This confirms that there were some initial reports of fatalities.
* **The passage says:** ""...fa ny isany farany kosa dia mbola tsy fantatra."" (...but the final number is still unknown.) This indicates the final number of injuries is not known.

Therefore, the most accurate statement based on the text is that the official number of deaths is known.

So the answer is **D**.
"
"Hatramin’ny nidirana tao amin’ny Manchester City tamin’ny taona 2017, firy ny lalao nandraisan’i Jesus anjara?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Hatramin’izay ilay Brezilianina dia niady lalao miisa 53 ho an’ny klioba tanatin’ireo fifaninanana rehetra..."" which translates to ""Since then the Brazilian has played 53 games for the club across all competitions...""
"
Iza no klioba nandraisan’i Jesus saram-pidirana 27£ tapitrisa tao aminy?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The text states: ""Jesus iraika amby roapolo taona dia namonjy an’i Manchester City tamin’ny taona lasa, Janoary 2017, niala tao amin’ny Klioba breziliana Palmeiras tamin’ny sarany 27 tapitrisa £."" This translates to: ""Jesus, at the age of twenty years, joined Manchester City last year, January 2017, leaving the Brazilian club Palmeiras for a fee of £27 million.""

Therefore, Palmeiras is the club that received the transfer fee.
"
Inona no fanambarana tsy marina momba ireo vahiny tamin’ny trano fandraisam-bahiny?,"The correct answer is **D: Avy amin'ny tanàna masina ny ankamaroan'ny vahiny**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Olom-pirenena avy amin’ny Emirates Arabo mikambana ny ankabetsahan’ireo vahiny tao amin’ilay trano fandraisam-bahiny."" (People from the Emirates Arab Emirates make up the majority of the guests in the hotel.)  The Emirates are *not* the holy city of Mecca.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Tany Lameka nanao fivahinianana masina ireo vahiny** (The guests went to Mecca for the holy pilgrimage): The text clearly says they were in Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage.
* **B: Tsy olom-pirenena eo an-toerana ireo vahiny sasany** (Some of the guests were not locals): The text says they were from the Emirates Arab Emirates, meaning they were *not* locals.
* **C: Tao ireo vahiny tamin'ny alin'ny hajj** (There were guests during the night of Hajj): The text states the incident happened in the morning, during the Hajj pilgrimage.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no marina?","The correct answer is **C: Tao ireo vahiny ny alin’ny fivahinianana masina Hajj.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...Nisy mpivahiny masina maro tao amin’ny trano avo izay tonga hitsidika ny tanàna masina amin’ny fiantobohoan’ny fivahinianana masina haji."" (Translation: ""...Many holy pilgrims were in the tall building visiting the holy city in anticipation of the Hajj pilgrimage."") This clearly indicates the pilgrims were there for the Hajj.
* **A is incorrect** because the text says ""15 fara-fahakeliny ny isan’ny maty"" (at least 15 people died).
* **B is incorrect** because the text states ""Olom-pirenena avy amin’ny Emirates Arabo mikambana ny ankabetsahan’ireo vahiny tao amin’ilay trano fandraisam-bahiny."" (Translation: ""Citizens from the Emirates Arabo were among the foreigners in the hotel."") This doesn't mean *all* the foreigners were from there.
* **D is incorrect** because the text mentions people from the Emirates Arabo, not from Mecca.

"Mifototra amin'ny ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no vaovao tsy azo antoka momba ny fifandonana?","The correct answer is **A: Ny haben'ny fifandonana (The size of the impact)**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that experts are ""trying to determine the size of the crater"". This indicates that the size is *not yet known* and is still being investigated.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **B: Ny toerana nitrangan’ny fifandonana (The location of the impact):** The text mentions the satellite's altitude (491 miles), which implies a general location, but not the precise location. While not definitively stated, the location is more known than the crater size.
*   **C: Ny fiantraikan'ny fifandonana teto an-tany (The impact of the impact on Earth):** The text states that experts are trying to understand the impact's effects, implying that it's being assessed, not unknown.
*   **D: Ny toerana misy ireo potipotin-javatra (The location of the debris pot):** The text says the US Strategic Defense Initiative is tracking the debris field, indicating that the debris' location is being monitored.

Therefore, the only information that is explicitly stated as being *currently undetermined* is the size of the crater."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mbola tokony hofaritana mikasika ny fifandonana?","The correct answer is **D: Ny ambaratonga marin’ny fianjerana (The size of the crater)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ny mbola miezaka mamantatra ny haben’ilay fianjerana sy ny fomba hahavoa ny Tany izy ireo."" (They are still trying to determine the size of the crater and how it might affect the Earth.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iza no hitantanana ny fanarahamaso ireo potipotin-javatra (Who will manage the tracking of the debris)** - While the US government is interested in the debris, the passage doesn't mention who will manage the tracking.
* **B: Hafainganam-pandeha manao ahoana no nandehanan’ny zanabolana tamin’ny fotoanan’ny fifandonana (How fast was the satellite traveling at the time of impact)** - The passage provides the orbit period (21 hours) but doesn't give the speed at the time of impact.
* **C: Ahoana ny fomba hizarana ny fanoritana ny vokatry ny fanadihadiana (How will the research findings be shared)** - The passage mentions a webpage will be created for the public, but doesn't detail how the research findings will be shared.



Therefore, the passage focuses on determining the **size of the crater**.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, fahafiry no toerana nametrahana indray an’i Batten tao amin’ny lisitry ny Amerikanina Mpanankarena indrindra?","The correct answer is **C: Faha-190**.

The text states: ""I Batten no voalahatra ho faha-190 tamin’ireo Amerikanina 400 Mpanan-karena Indrindra tamin’ny 2008..."" which translates to ""Batten was ranked 190th among the 400 Richest Americans in 2008...""
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no nanaovan’i Batten fanomezana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny Oniversiten’i Virginia**.

The text states: ""I Batten no voalahatra ho faha-190 tamin’ireo Amerikanina 400 Mpanan-karena Indrindra tamin’ny 2008 izay notombanana ho $2,3 lavitrisa ny fananany. Nivoaka avy tamin’ny sekoly ambony Kolejin’ny Ara & Siansa tao amin’ny Oniversite Virginia tamin’ny 1950 izy ary lasa mpanolotra lehibe tao amin’io toerana io.""

This clearly indicates that Batten graduated from the University of Virginia.
"
Inona no tsy ampahany amin'ny volavolan-dalàna nosoniavin'i Governora Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: Fandrarana ny fivarotana na fanofana lalao an-dahatsary mahery setra amin'ny zaza tsy ampy taona any ivelan'i California.**

Here's why:

*   The question states that the law specifically targets sales or rentals *within* the state of California. 
*   Options A, B, and D are all parts of the law as described in the question.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* part of the law is restricting sales/rentals of violent video games to minors outside of California."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no tsy naharaka ny zavatra voalaza?","The correct answer is **B: Mike**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Duvall and his wife didn't emphasize Miller's account.
* Miller says Mike talked a lot during the incident and he wasn't prepared for what Mike said.

Therefore, Mike is the one who talked a lot and whose words Miller wasn't prepared for."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no marina tamin'ny zavatra niainan'i Miller nandritra ny fakana am-bavany?","The correct answer is **A: Nanindry an'i Miller nandritra ny fakana am-bavany i Duvall.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Be resaka be I Mike mandritra ny fakana am-bava…"" (There was a lot of talking during the oral sex...).
* **Miller's quote implies:** Duvall was saying things that were surprising or overwhelming (""Mbola niomana aho ka tsy reko tsara izay nolazainy."" - I was unprepared and didn't quite understand what he said).  This suggests Duvall was talking *to* Miller.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsy niraharaha izy rehefa niomana:** Miller explicitly states he was *preparing* and *didn't understand* what Duvall said, implying he *was* paying attention.
* **C: Be resaka nandritra ny fakana am-bavany ny zanak’i Duvall anankiroa:** The text refers to Duvall's son, not grandchildren.
* **D: Nihaino tsara ny tantaran'i Duvall izy:** Miller's quote suggests he wasn't fully understanding Duvall's words, so he wasn't necessarily listening well.



"
Iza no nampandroso hevitra fa tokony natao ny fanitsiana ny ‘Lalànan'ny Rivotra Madio’?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The text states: ""Layton nangataka ny hanovana ny volavolandalàna nataon’ny mpandala ny nentin-drazana momba ny tontolo iainana nandritra ny fihaonana tamin’ny Praiministra, nangataka ny “hamerenana ny famolavolana feno sy tanteraka” ny volavolandalàna momba ny tontolo iainana nataon’ny antoko mpandala ny nentin-drazana."" This clearly indicates that Jack Layton requested the revisions.



"
"""Iza no nandà fa ny “Lalàn'ny Rivotra Madio"""" dia nampiasaina ho toy ny famelezana mialoha ny fifidianana?""","The correct answer is **D: Solombavambahoaka Federaly**.

The passage states: ""Hatramin’izay nidiran’ny Governemanta Federaly an-tsehatra hamatsy vola ny hopitaly Mersey ao Devonport, Tasmania, dia nokianin’ny governemanta-panjakana sy **depiote federaly** ho toy ny dokambarotra izany mialoha ny fifidianana federaly amin’ny Novambra.""

This indicates that federal MPs (solombavambahoaka federaly) were the ones who viewed the funding as electioneering.
"
Inona no niforona tamin’ny fifangaroana asidra sianôrika sy ny melaminina rehefa nifanotohoto tamin'ny amanin-tsaka ireo?,"The correct answer is **C: Kristaly**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mifangaro ireo taharo roa ireo ka manao fiota simika mba hamoronana **kristaly** izay mety manakana ny asan’ny voa..."" (These two compounds mix to create a chemical reaction that produces **crystals** that can block the action of the poison...).
"
Inona no nampiasain’ny mpikaroka ny spektrôskôpia mitara-mena hodinihana?,"The correct answer is **C: Biby fiompy voakasika (Affected pets)**.

Here's why:

The question states: ""The crystals that make up these crystals were identified by comparison with the jowls of sick pets when performed with **FTIR spectroscopy** (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy).""

Therefore, the FTIR spectroscopy was used to analyze the tissues (specifically the jowls) of the sick pets.
"
"""Iza no nanondro an'i Luna ho """"Mpanjakavavin'ny Extreme""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer “i Luna no mpanjakavavy voalohan'ny Extreme. Izy ihany koa no mpampiofana ahy voalohany.”"" This directly attributes the title of ""Queen of Extreme"" to Tommy Dreamer.
"
Iza no nanondro an’i Luna ho “hafahafa”?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin “Goldust” Runnels fa ”Niavaka tahaka ahy i Luna...mety mbola nihoatra azy...tiako izy ary manina azy...efa amin’ny toerana tsaratsa kokoa izy izao."" which translates to ""Dustin “Goldust” Runnels said that “Luna is special like me...maybe even better...I love her and respect her...she is now in a better place.”""  Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who described Luna as special. While Tommy Dreamer praised her strength and importance, and the government researchers discovered her body, Dustin Runnels specifically used the word ""special"" in his statement.
"
Inona no tsy nitranga tamin'ilay mpamily voarohirohy tamin’ny fianjerana?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsy nandratra na iza na iza olona tao an-trano izy.**

The text states: ""Na dia olona telo aza tanatin’ilay trano tamin’ilay fiara nandona izany, dia tsy nisy naratra izy ireo."" This directly translates to: ""Even though there were three people in the house at the time of the crash, none of them were injured.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naratra ny lohany** (He was injured in the head): The text clearly states he had a head injury.
*   **C: Nafindra niala ny hopitaly iray tao Cambridge nankany Great Yarmouth izy** (He was transferred from a hospital in Cambridge to Great Yarmouth): The text states he was transferred *to* the hospital in Cambridge, not the other way around.
*   **D: Nanampy nanala azy tao anaty fiarany ny sampana vonjy taitra** (The ambulance crew helped remove him from the car): The text mentions the road was closed *during* the removal of the driver. It doesn't say the ambulance crew *helped* remove him.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* true about the driver is that he didn't injure anyone in the house."
Inona no zavatra tsy nisongadina momba ny filalaovan’i Afrika Atsimo nandritra ny fifaninanana rugby?,"The correct answer is **B: Fahaizana mitazona baolina (Ability to hold the ball)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""the defensive skills, the experience playing the ball and the teamwork of the team were very good"". Therefore, the ability to hold the ball was *not* a notable weakness or something that didn't stand out. Options A, C, and D are all mentioned as strengths.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, oviana ny lalaon’i Afrika Atsimo no nanomboka nihatsara?","The correct answer is **D: Rehefa nandeha ny fifaninanana**.

The passage states: ""Nanomboka tamin’ny 10:00 maraina ny lalao miaraka amin’ny andro tsara... Toa tapa-kevitra ho tsy mahay ilay lalao mifanohitra amin’ireo rahavaviny avy any Atsimo, na izany aza, **nandroso hatrany i Afrika Atsimo rehefa nandeha ny fifaninanana**."" This indicates that the team improved as the tournament progressed.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no tsy ahitana taratra marina ny toekaren'i Sina?","The correct answer is **D: Tsy mbola nanondrana fiara betsaka kokoa noho i Alemaina i Sina** (China has never exported more cars than Germany).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Sambany, tamin’ny taon-dasa dia i Sina no nanondrana fiarakodia betsaka kokoa noho i Alemaina..."" (Once, last year, China exported more cars than Germany...).
* Option D directly contradicts this statement.
* Options A, B, and C are all supported by the information in the text.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that is not accurately reflected in the provided text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, rahoviana no afaka hihoatra an’i Etazonia ny Harin-karena Faoben’i Chine?","The correct answer is **B: Ao anatin'ny roapolo taona**.

The text states: ""Sambany, tamin’ny taon-dasa dia i Sina no nanondrana fiarakodia betsaka kokoa noho i Alemaina ary nihoarany ny Etazonia izay tsena lehibe indrindra ao amin’io indostria io. **Mety ho ambony kokoa noho ny Harinkarena Anatin’i Etazonia ny an’i Sina ao anatin’ny roapolo taona.**""

This directly indicates that China's GDP could surpass that of the US within the next twenty years."
Inona no sosokevitr’i Hu fa tokony nataon’ireo firenena an-dalam-pandrosoana?,"The correct answer is **D: Miala amin’ny lalana taloha amin’ny fandotoana**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Hu ”mba hiala amin’ny fomba fahiny izay mandoto aloha vao manadio avy eo.”"" This translates to ""Hu wants [developing countries] to move away from the old way of doing things, where they pollute first and then clean up.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mandray ny adidy manosika azy ireo ho amin’ny dingana fampandrosoana** (Taking the initiative to promote them to the next stage of development): While development is mentioned, the core point isn't about taking *initiative* but about changing *methods*.
* **B: Mifantoka amin'ny famokarana ara-toekarena** (Focusing on economic production):  Economic production is mentioned in the context of *how* to achieve development, but it's not the overarching suggestion.
* **C: Mandeha mihoatra ny andraikiny ankehitriny** (Going beyond their current responsibilities): Hu explicitly says they shouldn't take on responsibilities beyond their capacity.



"
Inona no tsy nolazain'i Hu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ny daty hanantenaina hampihenana ny lefan-karbônina (The anticipated date for carbon emission reduction)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what Hu *didn't* mention. The passage states that Hu talked about the *trend* of carbon emissions in 2020 compared to 2005, and the need for developing nations to avoid polluting before cleaning up. He also stressed not asking developing nations to take on more than they could handle.
* However, the passage explicitly states that Hu **didn't provide specific numbers for carbon emissions** and that these would depend on China's economic performance. 
* Therefore, the anticipated date for carbon emission reduction is something that was *not* mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ny fototry ny fanapahana (The basis of the decision):** The passage doesn't detail the rationale behind Hu's statements.
* **B: Torohevitra ho an'ny firenena an-dalam-pandrosoana momba ny fandotoana (Suggestions for developing nations about pollution):**  Hu *did* offer a suggestion (avoiding pollution before cleaning up) to developing nations.
* **D: Tarehimarika amin’ny fampihenana ny lefan-karbônina (Carbon emission reduction milestones):** Hu didn't mention any specific milestones or targets for carbon emission reduction.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no nolazain'i Verman fa tsy tsara ny toe-draharaha?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The text states: ""Mizotra mankany amin’ny fiparitahana valan'aretina mafy indrindra nandalovany i Angola ary tena mbola ratsy ny toe-draharaha ao Angola"". This translates to: ""Angola is moving towards the most severe outbreak of disease it has ever experienced and the situation in Angola is very bad.""

Therefore, Richard Veerman specifically stated that the situation in **Angola** is bad.
"
"Noho ny fitoriana, iza no handray ny toeran'ny kabinetran’i Huhne?","The correct answer is **C: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Ny solombavambahoaka Norman Lamb dia andrasana handray ny toerana maha minisitry ny Varotra izay ialan’i Davey."" (The Member of Parliament Norman Lamb is expected to take the place of the Secretary of State for Business which Ed Davey is resigning from.)
"
Iza no handray ny andraikitry ny minisitry ny Fandraharahana aorian’n'ny fitoriana?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Ny solombavambahoaka Norman Lamb dia andrasana handray ny toerana maha minisitry ny Varotra izay ialan’i Davey."" which translates to ""The Member of Parliament Norman Lamb is expected to take over the position of Minister of the Economy which is vacated by Davey.""
"
Inona no amporisihan’ireo mpanao fampisehoana hataon’ny mpihaino mandritra ny opera an’i Camille Saint-Saen?,"The correct answer is **A: Mandray anjara amin'ny fampiasana rongony**.

The text explicitly states: ""Vokatr’izany, mifoka rongony eo ambony sehatra ireo mpisehatra ary ny teatra mihitsy no mampirisika ny mpanatrika handray anjara.""  This translates to: ""As a result, the actors release incense on stage, and the theater itself encourages the audience to participate.""

Therefore, the actors' performance involves releasing incense.
"
Iza no tena mifoka rongony mandritra ny opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Ireo mpanao fampisehoana (The performers)**.

The question states: ""Ny vokatr’izany, mifoka rongony eo ambony sehatra ireo mpisehatra ary ny teatra mihitsy no mampirisika ny mpanatrika handray anjara."" This translates to: ""As a result, the performers on stage are blowing incense, and the theater itself encourages the audience to participate.""  Therefore, the performers are the ones blowing incense.
"
"""Inona no anarana hafa iantsoana ny """"spacewalk"""" nataon’i Leonov?""","The correct answer is **C: Hetsika ivelan’ny Sambon-danitra**

The text states: ""Tamin’ny 18 Martsa 1965, dia notanterahiny ny hetsika voalohany ivelan’ny sambondanitra (EVA), na """"fivoahana an'habakabaka"""", ary nijanona irery ivelan’ny sambondanitra nandritra ny roa ambin’ny folo minitra mihoatra kely.""

This directly translates to: ""On March 18, 1965, he performed the first spacewalk (EVA), or """"spacewalk"""", and remained alone outside the spacecraft for a little over ten minutes.""

Therefore, ""Hetsika ivelan’ny Sambon-danitra"" (Spacewalk) is the alternate name for the EVA.
"
Leonov no nitarika ny ampahany Sovietika tamin’ny iraka inona?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Folo taona taty aoriana dia notaritiny ny ampahany sovietikan’ny iraka Apollo-Soyuz..."" which translates to ""Ten years later, he participated in the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission...""
"
Iza no naratra tamin'ny fianjerana?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""Taorian’ilay lozam-pifamoivozana, dia nentina tany amin’ny hôpitaly i Gibson nefa maty fotoana fohy taorian’izay.""  This directly tells us that Gibson died as a result of the accident. The other options are incorrect because:

*   The garage worker witnessed the accident but wasn't injured.
*   The children were nearby but the text doesn't say they were injured.
*   The truck driver wasn't injured.



"
Inona no nanjo ny olona voarohirohy tamin'ny loza?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny iray tsy naratra, ny iray maty.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that Gibson, the driver, died.
* The passage states the truck driver was not injured.

Therefore, one person died and one person was not injured.
"
Nanantena ny hahita fiantraika ateraky ny iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto ny mpahay siansa miasa momba ny fandaharan’asa?,"The correct answer is **B: Herin’ny riaka (Wave forces)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the theory posits that the gravitational interaction between the Sagittarius Galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way is akin to the Moon's gravitational pull causing tides.  Tides are a result of **wave forces** – the gravitational influence propagating as a wave. The program was designed to *visualize* these gravitational effects.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Raharaha mahazatra (Normal forces):** The text doesn't describe the interaction as a direct, contact-based force like normal forces. It's about gravity and how it propagates.
*   **C: Singa madinika (Tiny particles):** While the theory suggests a distribution of dark matter resembling a luminous shell made of tiny elements, the focus of the visualization program is on the *forces* exerted, not simply the presence of particles.
*   **D: Rahahaha maizina (Strong magnetic forces):** The text is about *gravity* and dark matter, not magnetism."
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no raharaha nodinihan’ny mpahay siansa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny vondron-kintana Alakaosy sy ny Vahindanitra**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states the research focuses on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.**
* **It also mentions the interaction between the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy and the Milky Way Galaxy (the large spiral galaxy).** This makes the Milky Way Galaxy (or the broader group of galaxies it's part of - the Local Group, which includes the Andromeda Galaxy and other dwarf galaxies) a key area of study.
* **The moon is only mentioned as an analogy** to explain the concept of gravitational effects, not as a direct subject of the research.

Therefore, the research deals with the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy (which is part of the Local Group).
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy notsikerain’ny kaonservativa?","The correct answer is **C: Iza no nahazo ny fifanekena tamin’ny asa fanorenana**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the criticism of the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina focused on the awarding of reconstruction contracts to people perceived as being politically connected to Washington. This directly points to the controversy surrounding *who* received the contracts, not the spending or the construction itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ny fandaniana tamin’ny asa fanavotana:** While the passage mentions the overall inadequacy of the response, it doesn't specifically focus on the amount of money spent on rebuilding.
*   **B: Ny tsy fahampian’ny ezaka fanorenana:**  The passage highlights a lack of effectiveness in the rebuilding efforts, but it doesn't directly state that there was a lack of effort.
*   **D: Ny fandaniana tamin’ny fanorenana:** Similar to A, the passage doesn't specifically focus on the expenditure for rebuilding.



Therefore, the core issue highlighted in the passage that conservatives *didn't* address, according to the text, is **who benefited from the contracts for reconstruction**."
Iza no mitsikera ny fifanekena fanorenana ho an’ny ezaka fanavotana tamin’ny Rivodoza Katrina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny mpandala ny hetra mahazatra (Conservative pundits)**.

The passage explicitly states: "" izay nantsoin’ireo mpandala ny hetra tamin’ny fomba feno hanihany hoe “Fifanarahan’i Bush any Nouvelle-Orléans.”"" (which the conservative pundits sarcastically called ""Bush's response to New Orleans."")

Therefore, the conservative pundits are the ones criticizing the recovery contracts.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, aiza no ahitana voalohany ny jiro avy ao amin’ny sambondanitra Stardust?","The correct answer is **B: California Andrefana**.

The text states: ""Handalo ny morony andrefana aty amin’ny tapany avaratr’i Californie izy ary hanazava ny lanitra manomboka any Californie hatrany Oregon afovoany mandalo Nevada sy Idaho ary Utah”. This indicates that the Stardust capsule's lights will first be visible in Northern California.

While the lights will be visible in Oregon, Nevada, and Utah as well, California is the first location mentioned.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no hametrahan’ny sambondanitra fanamby?","The correct answer is **C: Miverina ety an-Tany haingana indrindra**

The passage states: ""Stardust dia nandrakitra ny tarehimarika vaovao ara-tantara amin’ny maha-sambondanitra haingana indrindra niverina teto an-tany..."" which translates to ""Stardust set a new historical record for the fastest return to Earth...""

While the other options are mentioned, the primary focus of the passage regarding the comet is its record-breaking speed of return.
"
Inona no fifandraisan’i Dr. Malar Balasubramanian sy Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Reny**.

The text states that the deceased woman was named Saroja Balasubramanian, 53 years old. The doctor's name is Dr. Malar Balasubramanian.  The fact that the police found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian and the doctor is also named Balasubramanian strongly implies they are related, and the context suggests a mother-child relationship.
"
Taiza no nahitana ny vata-mangatsiakan’i Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: Ankilan’ny an-dalana (Shoulder of the road)**.

The text states: ""Tany, hitan-dry zareo ny vatan’i Saroja Balasubramanian, 53 taona, voasarona lamba misy tasin-drà. **Nilaza ny polisy fa efa teo nandritra ny iray andro teo ilay faty raha ny fahitana azy.**"" and  ""...nalefany tany amin’ny Oldsmobile Intrigue-ny mainty izay 500 feet niala teo ireo mpitandro filaminana.""  This implies the body was found on the shoulder of the road.
"
Iza no lasa fananan’ny eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The question states that eBay's largest acquisition was Skype, and they hoped this would help grow their revenue and reach new users in regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.
"
Inona no kasain’ny eBay tanterahina amin’ny fahazoana izany?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny fiitarana amin’ny faritra vaovao** (Expansion into new regions).

Here's why:

The question states eBay wants to:

* **Increase revenue:** This is a key goal of expansion.
* **Bring more users to Skype:** This implies expanding their reach to areas where Skype is popular.
* **Specifically mention regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil:** These are all new or growing markets for eBay.

Therefore, the primary goal is to expand into these new regions to achieve the stated objectives.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Manamafy orina ny fidiram-bolany (Strengthen its financial foundation):** While increased revenue *would* strengthen their financial foundation, it's a consequence of expansion, not the primary goal mentioned.
* **C: Mampiakatra ny mombamomba azy (Boost its reputation):**  Increased revenue and user growth can lead to a better reputation, but it's not the direct focus of the statement.
* **D: Manome fahafaham-po ho an’ireo mpiara miombon’antoka aminy (Satisfy its stakeholders):**  Satisfying stakeholders is a general business objective, but the text focuses on specific expansion goals.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no tsy nifandray tamin’ireo gadra izay nijanona teny an-tokontany taorian’ny ady?","The correct answer is **D: Mpiasan’ny hôpitaly**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the prisoners who stayed outside *refused to return to their cells* after being transported to the hospital. This implies they were already at the hospital before the events described.
* The text mentions *MDT* (likely referring to military personnel/rescue team) intervening and using tear gas and smoke bombs. 
* The firefighters put out the fire. 
* The question asks who *didn't* participate in the events involving the prisoners outside.  The prisoners were at the hospital, but *refused to go back*. The passage explicitly states that the translators tried to persuade them. 
* Therefore, the hospital staff (who were presumably responsible for their care at the hospital) were not directly involved in the conflict that erupted outside.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no nahatonga ireo gadra hihemotra tsy hikomy?,"The correct answer is **B: Etona mandatsa-dranomaso**.

Here's why:

The passage states that soldiers ""entered the area with their armored vehicles and used **flamethrowers** to push back the prisoners and fired smoke grenades."" This action directly explains why the prisoners retreated. The use of flamethrowers is a forceful and intimidating tactic designed to disperse crowds, not a result of successful negotiation, friendly prisoners, or general confusion.



"
"Araka ny hevitry ny Ayatollah Khamenei, amin’inona no tokony anafahana an’i Iran?","The correct answer is **D: Fiankinan-doha amin’ny solika**.

The text states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei considers dependence on oil to be a ""trap"" since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution and that Iran should get rid of it.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no nanaiky ny fiantraikan’ny fanasaziana amin’ny toekarena iraniana?","The correct answer is **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei**.

The text states: ""Tanatin’ny tatitra isam-bolana nataony farany indrindra, nilaza ny OPEC fa latsaka tamin’ny tahany ambany indrindra nandritra ny roapolo taona ny fanondranana solika tsy voadio izay mahatratra 2,8 tapitrisa barika isan’andro. **Ny mpitarika faratampony, Ayahtollah Ali Khamenei, dia namaritra ny fiankinandoha amin’ny solika ho toy ny “fandrika” nanomboka talohan’ny revolisiona silamo tao Iràna tamin’ny 1979 ary tokony hialan’ny firenena.**""

This clearly indicates that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged the impact of sanctions on the Iranian economy and stated the country should move away from its dependence on oil. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Loharanom-baovaon’olona ambony** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: OPEC** - OPEC only reported on the decline in oil exports, not necessarily agreeing with the sanctions' impact.
*   **D: Ny Vondrona Eoropeana** - The text mentions the European Union imposed sanctions, but it doesn't state that the EU acknowledged the impact of those sanctions."
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ao anaty paikam-pandrotsaham-baton’i Frantsa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny vato isain’ny solontenan’ny kandidà (The number of candidates' representatives)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that candidates can send representatives to observe the entire process. However, it *doesn't* specify a number for how many representatives can be sent. The other options are all mentioned as part of the French ballot box procedures:

*   **A: Vatam-pifidianana mangarahara (Strict ballot box)** - This is a key aspect of French ballot box procedures, ensuring transparency.
*   **B: Solontena alefan’ny kandidà (Candidates' representatives)** -  The text directly states that candidates can send representatives.
*   **C: Manasonia ny lisi-pifidianana (Checking the voting list)** - This is a step performed by voters before casting their ballot, as described in the text.

Since the number of representatives isn't defined in the text, it's the option that's *not* explicitly included in the described ballot box procedure.



"
Aiza no anondroan’ny mpifidy ny kandidà nofidiany?,"The correct answer is **A: Ao amin’ny lisi-pifidianana (On the ballot)**.

The text states: ""Rehefa voamarin’ireo manampahefana ny mombamomba ny mpifidy, alatsaky ny mpifidy anatin’ny vata fifidianana ny valopy ary manasonia ny lisim-pifidianana izy."" (After the authorities verify the voter's information, the voter slips the ballot into the ballot box and marks the ballot paper with the person they choose.)

This means the voter indicates their choice *on the ballot*.
"
Inona no nahatonga an’i Allen hanomboka fikarohana valo taona ho an’ny Musashi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny fahalianany amin’ny ady (His passion for war)**.

The text states: ""Allen, one of the most resourceful people, mortgaged a large part of his wealth to undertake underwater exploration and began his quest for the Musashi due to his passion for war."" 

This clearly indicates that Allen's love for war was the driving force behind his eight-year search for the Musashi.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no nandanian’i Allen volabe tamin’ny volany?","The correct answer is **B: Fitrandrahana an-dranomasina**

The text states that Allen ""nampanjary ampahany be tamin’ny hareny tamin’ny fitsirihana an-dranomasina"" which translates to ""spent a large part of his fortune on underwater exploration"".  This means he spent money on underwater exploration, which is a form of marine exploration.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no mety hitondra ho amin’ny toe-draharaha mampidi-doza ao anaty sy manodidina ny ozinina?","The correct answer is **A: Solika oraniôma (Uranium oil)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that authorities suspect that containers of **uranium oil** leaked and leaked.
* The presence of cesium and iodine radioactive materials within the plant further supports this suspicion, as uranium is a radioactive element.

The other options are present as a result of the potential leak of the uranium oil, but the *source* of the initial contamination is the uranium oil.

Therefore, the most direct answer to what *caused* the hazardous situation is the uranium oil.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no torohevitra iray tsy mety atolotra ny mponina ao an-toerana taorian’ny zava-nitranga tao amin’ny ozinina?,"The correct answer is **A: Sorohina ny fifohana rivotry ny milina mpamoaka rivotra (Avoid using air conditioners)**.

Here's why:

* **The situation involves radioactive particles (cesium and iodine) released from the plant.**  The primary concern is inhalation and ingestion of these particles.
* **Option A is directly related to preventing inhalation.** Air conditioners can circulate air inside homes, potentially bringing in contaminated air. Avoiding their use helps prevent further inhalation of radioactive particles.
* **Option B (Mijanona an-trano - Stay indoors)** is a reasonable precaution to limit exposure.
* **Option C (Sorohina ny fifohana setroka fotsy - Avoid inhaling the white smoke)** is already a stated precaution.
* **Option D (Mihazona tsy hisotro rano mitsika - Avoid drinking tap water)** is also a reasonable precaution, as the water pump might have been contaminated.

Therefore, avoiding air conditioners (Option A) is the least relevant or potentially contradictory instruction given the other precautions already being taken. It doesn't directly address the core problem of radioactive particle inhalation in the way the other options do.



"
"Araka i Dr. Moll, inona no tena mampanahy indrindra momba ny XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Ny haavon’ny taham-pahafatesana aterany (The rate of mortality it causes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ny karazany hafa dia tahaka ny “manakorontana sy mampiahiahy nohon’ny habehan’ny tahan’ny fahafatesana”"" which translates to ""the other types are like ""destructive and alarming because of the high rate of mortality""."" This directly indicates that Dr. Moll considers the mortality rate the most concerning aspect of XDR-TB.

While options A, B, and C are all valid concerns about XDR-TB, the passage explicitly highlights the mortality rate as the primary worry."
Marary firy tratran’ny ovan’aretina vaovao no voamarina ho mpiasan’ny fahasalamana?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""mpiasan’ny hopitaly roa farafahakeliny no tratra."" which translates to ""at least two hospital staff members were affected."" While the text mentions a potential transmission rate of 10-15 people per infected person, the confirmed number of healthcare workers infected is stated as at least two.
"
Karazan-teknolojia inona no ampiasain’ny rafitra NextGen?,"The correct answer is **A: Teknolojia mifototra amin’ny zanabolana (Technology based on satellites)**.

The text explicitly states: ""...mampiasa teknolojia avy amin’ny zana-bolana..."" which translates to ""...uses technology from satellites..."".
"
Ahoana no isitrahan’ny NextGen mivantana amin’ny mpanara-maso ny fifamoivoizana an’habakabaka?,"The correct answer is **B: Fanofana fiaramanidina marina kokoa (More accurate tracking of aircraft)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen uses technology (derived from lunar technology) to help air traffic controllers ""see"" aircraft more accurately. This means more precise and reliable tracking of aircraft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zotram-pisidinana fohy kokoa (Shorter routes):** While NextGen *aims* for shorter routes, the passage doesn't say that the technology directly *improves* route shortening. It's a benefit of the more accurate tracking.
* **C: Fampihenana ny lefan-karibônina (Reduced carbon emissions):**  This is a *result* of NextGen's efforts (more efficient routes and fuel use), but not the direct way it impacts air traffic controllers.
* **D: Solika kely kokoa (Less fuel):** Similar to carbon emissions, this is a consequence of the improved efficiency, not the direct effect on controllers.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy notsikerain’ny mpahay tantara amin’izay ifantohan’ny FBI?","The correct answer is **B: Mitsinjara fitaovana amin’ireo raharahan-keloka bevava mora vahana.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the historian focused on the FBI's focus on ""more manageable cases, especially car theft, in order to boost the bureau's success rate."" 
* This means the historian was concerned about the FBI prioritizing less serious crimes to improve its statistics, rather than tackling more significant cases.
* Option B accurately reflects this concern about prioritizing ""manageable cases"" (meaning less complex or serious) and focusing on the outcome (success rate).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mampisonga ny taham-pahombiazany** - While a result of the FBI's focus, this isn't the *focus* itself.
* **C: Fifantohana mafy amin’ny raharahan-tsary vetaveta** - The passage doesn't mention any focus on pornography.
* **D: Raharaham-pangalarana fiara** - The passage mentions car theft as an example of a ""manageable case,"" but not as the overall *focus* of the FBI.



"
Inona ilay hetsika mamoha fady terena ho ataon’ny FBI?,"The correct answer is **D: Mpiasa manokatena amin’ny raharahan-tsary vetaveta**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the FBI was pressured by the Congress to dedicate 10 people to **pornography cases involving minors** (raharahan-tsary vetaveta).  This is the action being asked about.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mitsinjara fitaovana maro kokoa amin’ny raharaham-pangalarana fiara:** While the passage mentions a focus on petty crimes like car theft, the pressure from Congress wasn't about increasing resources for those cases.
* **B: Mampisonga ny taham-pahombiazan’ny sampan-draharaha:** The goal was to *improve* the FBI's success rate, not sabotage it.
* **C: Mifantoka amin’ny raharaha tokony ho mora vahana:** This is a *reason* for the shift in focus, not the actual action being forced.



"
Inona no nitranga tamin’ilay fiara mpamonjy voina hamonjy ny fianjeran’ny JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **B: Nivadika (Turned over)**.

The text states: ""Mitatitra ny fampitam-baovao ao an-toerana fa nisy fiara iray mpamono afo tao amin’ny seranampiaramanidina nivadika teo am-pamaliana."" which translates to ""Local reports indicate that a fire truck at the airbase overturned in the crash.""
"
"Taorian’ny fianjeran’ny JAS 39C Gripen, nikatona ho an’ny inona ny seranam-piaramanidina?","The correct answer is **A: Zotra ara-barotra (Commercial flights)**.

The text explicitly states: ""ary nahatonga ny seranampiaramanidina nanidy ireo sidina ara-barotra"" which translates to ""and caused the airport to close commercial flights.""
"
Iza no nanoloran’i Brzezinski tolo-pitarihana nandritra ny revolisiona iraniana?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states: ""...nanampy an’i Carter tamin’ny fifandraisana ara-diplaomatika eran-tany izy, toy ny Tolom-piavotana iranianina, izay nitondra tamin’ny krizin’ny takalonaina tany Iran, 1979..."" This directly indicates that Brzezinski assisted Carter during the Iranian Revolution. Henry Kissinger is mentioned as his predecessor at the NSA, but not as someone who assisted during the revolution."
Iza no nitazona ny toeran’ny Mpanolotsainan’ny Fiarovam-pirenena mandra-pahatonga ny taona 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The text states: ""Tamin’ny naha NSA azy dia nanampy an’i Carter tamin’ny fifandraisana ara-diplaomatika eran-tany izy, toy ny... nandimby an’i Henry Kissinger."" This means Kissinger held the position of NSA *before* Brzezinski."
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ahitana taratra ny anton’asan’i Bobek tao amin’ny Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **D: Nilalao matetika kokoa noho ny mpilalao hafa izy**.

Here's why:

* **A: Nahatafiditra baolina 468 izy raha nilalao ho an’ny ekipa** - The text states he scored 403 goals in 468 games.  This is mentioned.
* **B: Nahatafiditra baolina maro kokoa noho ny mpilalao hafa izy** - The text explicitly says ""Tsy misy olon-kafa nanao fisehoana betsaka na nahafaty isa betsaka kokoa ho an’ny vondrona noho i Bobek."" (No one else made more appearances or scored more goals for the group than Bobek).
* **C: Voafidy ho mpilalao mahay indrindra tamin’ny tantaran’ny ekipa izy indray mandeha** - The text states he was voted the best player in the history of the Partizan club in 1995.
* **D: Nilalao matetika kokoa noho ny mpilalao hafa izy** - The text *doesn't* mention whether he played more frequently than other players. It focuses on his goal-scoring record and being considered the best.

Therefore, the only statement that isn't supported by the provided text is that he played more often than other players.



"
Iza amin’ny fanambarana momba ny tantaran’i Bobek nilalao tao amin’ny Partizan Belgrade no marina?,"The correct answer is **A: Nilalao ho an’ny Partizan izy nanomboka ny taona 1945**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Namonjy azy ireo izy tamin’ny 1945 ary nijanona tany hatramin’ny 1958."" (He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.) This directly confirms he started playing for Partizan in 1945.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nilalao tao amin’ny Zagreb izy talohan’ny tao amin'ny Partizan Belgrade:** The text states he was from Zagreb and played for Partizan *after* that.
* **C: Nilalao tao amin’ny Partizan izy hatramin’ny taona 1995:** The text states he stayed until 1958, not 1995.
* **D: Nahazo laza izy taorian’ny nifidianana azy ho mpilalao mahay indrindra tao amin’ny Partizan:** While being named the best player is a significant event, the text says he was *already* considered the best player in the history of Partizan in 1995, not that he gained fame *after* being selected.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that is directly and accurately supported by the provided text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona ireo toetra manavaka ny Hesperonychus amin’ny Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Manana vahoho faharoa lehibe kokoa izy**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ny hoho-tanana faharoa dia lehibe, nanome ny anarana Hesperonychus izay midika hoe ”hoho-tanana tandrefana”."" (The second hand is large, giving the name Hesperonychus, which means ""western hand"").
* **The text also mentions:** ""Ity vorona mpihaza rakotra volo sy mafana rà ity dia ninoana ho nandeha nijoro tsara tamin’ny tongotra roa nisy hoho tahaka ny Velociraptor."" (This feathered, warm-blooded bird is believed to have walked well on two legs like the Velociraptor.) This indicates they share the bipedal stance, but the distinct feature is the size of the second hand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Manana tongotra roa izy:** Both Hesperonychus and Velociraptor are described as bipedal (walking on two legs). This isn't a distinguishing feature.
* **C: Voloina tanteraka ny vatany manontolo:** The text says Hesperonychus was ""rakotra volo"" (feathered), but it doesn't say it was *completely* feathered.  Velociraptor was also feathered. The degree of feathering isn't highlighted as a key difference.
* **D: Manana rà mafana izy:**  Both Hesperonychus and Velociraptor are described as ""mafana rà"" (warm-blooded). This isn't a distinguishing feature.



"
Ny dikan’ny “Hesperonychus” dia mivoaka avy amin’ny toetra ara-batana avy amin’ny karazam-biby inona?,"The correct answer is **B: Vatana voloina**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Ny hoho-tanana faharoa dia lehibe, nanome ny anarana Hesperonychus izay midika hoe ”hoho-tanana tandrefana”.""  ""Hesperonychus"" translates to ""western little head,"" and the text indicates this refers to the **feathers** on the hand. Therefore, ""vatana voloina"" (feathered body) is the closest description of the body part the name refers to.
"
Iza amin’ireo fanambarana momba an’ilay tranga fitifirana no marina kokoa?,"The correct answer is **C: Nivady herintaona mialoha tao Buffalo izy roa**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Herintaona lasa izy roa no nivady tany Texas, dia nankany Buffalo mba hankalaza izany niaraka tamin’ny fianakaviany sy ny namany."" (They got married two years ago in Texas, and went to Buffalo to celebrate with their family and friends.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Samy avy ao Texas na ny lahy na ny vavy mivady** - The text says they got married in Texas, but doesn't state where they are from.
*   **B: Nisy dimy ny lasibatra** - The text says ""anisan’ireo olona efatra maty nandritra ny fitifirana"" (one of the four people who died during the shooting). This means there were four deaths total, not five.
*   **D: Nitranga tao Buffalo ilay fitifirana** - The text says they went to Buffalo *to celebrate* their anniversary, implying the shooting happened *there*, but it does not explicitly state it happened in Buffalo. It only states the people were in Buffalo when the shooting occurred.

Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the provided text."
Iza amin’ireo fanambarana momba an’ilay tranga fitifirana no marina kokoa ?,"The most accurate answer is **A: Nitranga tamin'ny fety fankalazana tsingerintaona tao Buffalo io** (It happened at an anniversary party in Buffalo).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Olona 100 raha kely indrindra no nanatrika ny fety fankalazana ny tsingerintaonam-panambadiana voalohan’ny mpivady iray izay notontosaina tamin'ny herintaona ny fanambadiany. Nisy fankalazana tsingerin-taona amin'ny fomba ofisialy iray nokasaina hatao tamin'ny daty manaraka, hoy ireo manam-pahefana."" This translates to ""The minimum of 100 people attended the first wedding anniversary party of a couple whose marriage was celebrated for a year. An official anniversary celebration was planned for the following date, according to officials.""  The couple celebrated *in Buffalo* with family and friends. The shooting happened at that party.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Nitranga tamin’ny lanonana fankalazana tsingerintaona ofisialy io** (It happened at an official anniversary celebration): While an official celebration was *planned*, the shooting happened *at the party*, not the planned official celebration.
* **C: Nitranga tamin'ny fety iray tao Texas io** (It happened at a party in Texas): The couple celebrated *in Buffalo*, not Texas.
* **D: Nitranga tamin’ny fanambadian’olon-droa io** (It happened at the marriage of a couple): The shooting happened at the *anniversary party* of the couple, not during their marriage ceremony itself.



Therefore, option A is the most directly supported by the text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona nampiahiahy voalohany ireo manampahefana momba an’i Luno?","The correct answer is **C: Fiparitahan’ny solika (Spreading of the oil)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Luno leaked 120-160 cubic meters of fuel and was pushed onto the reef by wind and waves. The initial concern of the authorities was that the oil tanker, which is normally used to transport chemicals, might damage its cargo.  This directly relates to the *spreading of the oil* and potential environmental impact.  While the wind and waves caused the incident, the primary worry was the oil spill itself and the potential damage it could cause.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ny fahapotehan’i Luno ireto no tsy marina?","The incorrect statement is **C: Tamin’ireo mpiasa roa ambin’ny folo, iray no naratra.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nisy angidim-by nanavotra ireo mpiasa roa ambin’ny folo a ratra kely tamin’ny orona ihany no nahazo azy ireo."" which translates to ""Only two of the more than ten workers were slightly injured by the wave.""  Therefore, *two* workers were injured, not one.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Nitranga nialoha ny fampakarana ho ao amin’ny cargo ny fahavakisana** (The flooding occurred before the cargo was loaded). The text says the flooding happened *after* the boat was loaded (""Ny Ny Luno dia nitondra solika 120-160 metratra toratelo rehefa simba..."").
*   **B: Nanana solika 100 metatra ny sambo tamin’ny fotoana nahavaky azy** (The boat had 100 meters of fuel at the time of the flooding). The text explicitly states this (""Efa an-dalàna haka ilay sambo misy ny zezika mahazatra ilay sambo mirefy 100 metatra"").
*   **D: Natosika ho any amin’ny fefiloha ny sambo** (The boat was turned towards the helm). The text mentions the captain was initially afraid it would hit the cargo (""tatahotra hoe hanary ny entana ilay sambo""). While it doesn't specifically say it was turned *towards* the helm, the concern about hitting cargo implies a maneuver to avoid that.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
Tamin’ny tafolotaona firy no nahazoan’i Alzeria fahaleovantena?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960s**.

The text states: ""Tany amin’ny taona 1960 dia niverina tany Alzeria vao nahaleo tena izy hampianatra momba ny fanatontosana sarimihetsika."" This means Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.
"
Taiza no tsy nametrahana efijery fahitalavitra ijerena ny lanonam-pandevenana?,"The correct answer is **D: Tao amin’ny kianjan’ny Md Piera** (In St. Peter's Square).

The text explicitly states that many large screens were set up in *various locations* around Rome, *including* St. Peter's Square. It also mentions screens were set up throughout Italy and other parts of the world, *especially in Poland*.  Therefore, St. Peter's Square was *one of the locations* where screens were set up, not a place where they weren't.

The question asks where *didn't* they set up screens.  Since the text says they set up screens in various locations and specifically mentions St. Peter's Square as one of them, the other options are plausible locations *where* screens were set up.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D** because the text indicates that screens were set up *in* St. Peter's Square."
Taiza no nanatanterahana ny fotoam-pandevenana?,"The correct answer is **C: Tao amin’ny kianjan’ny Md Piera (St. Peter's Square)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Betsaka loatra ny olona tonga ka tsy ny rehetra no nahavita niditra tao amin’ilay fandevenana tao amin'ny St. Peter’s Square."" (Too many people came that not everyone was able to enter the ceremony in St. Peter's Square.)

While the text also mentions large screens were set up *around* Rome and in other locations (including Poland), the main event was held in St. Peter's Square.
"
"Taorian’ny fipoahana, iza no nokarakaraina tamin’ny ratra lalina?","The correct answer is **A: Farafahakeliny olona dimy**

The text states: ""Tsy nisy ratra mafy voatatitra, saingy raha kely indrindra dia olona dimy teo tamin’ny fotoanan’ny fipoahana no notsaboina noho ny fisian’ny fambaran’ny fahatairana mafy.""  This translates to: ""No serious injuries were reported, but at least five people who were near the time of the explosion were treated for minor burns.""
"
Iza no nitatitra ny fiporitsahan’ny etona?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpiray vodirindrina iray ao amin’ny tranobe (A resident of the apartment)**.

The text states: ""Rehefa nisy mpiray vodirindrina niantso fa misy etona mivoaka dia tonga teny an-toerana ny mpiasa ao amin’ilay orinasa mpamatsy etona."" (When a resident called to say there was smoke coming out, the workers from the gas company arrived at the scene.) This clearly indicates a resident reported the smoke.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, olona firy no maty nandritra ny fanafihana?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""I Nicholas Alden, 25 taona, sy Zachary Cuddeback, 21 taona no maty tamin'izany."" (Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old died in it.)

Therefore, two people died.
"
Fitaovam-piadian’iza no tsy nahavoa ny kinendriny nandritra ny fanafihana?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**. 

The text states: ""Tsy nahomby ny fitaovampiadian'i Uka raha nanondro ny lohana lehilahy fahadimy izy."" This translates to ""Uka's targeting device was not successful when pointing at the fifth man's head."" Therefore, Uka's targeting device failed.
"
Iza amin’ireto fanatanjahatena manaraka ireto no nanaovan-datsabato ho esorina amin’ny programa olaimpika?,"The correct answer is **C: Baseball**. 

The passage states: ""The squash, karate and wheeled sports were tried to be included in the Olympic program like baseball and softball, which were chosen to be dropped from the Olympic program in 2005."" 

Therefore, baseball was the sport that was dropped.
"
Iza amin’ireto fanatanjahatena manaraka ireto no nanaovan’ny Komity Olaimpika Iraisampirenena latsabato ho ampidirina amin’ny lalao?,"The correct answer is **D: Softball**.

The text states that baseball and softball were *rejected* from the Olympic program in 2005. Therefore, softball was one of the sports that the IOC did *not* approve for inclusion this time.
"
Maharitra firy taona no namoahan’i Arthur Guinness ny fanaovan-dabiera St James’ Gate tamin’ny voalohany?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The question asks how many years *after* the initial brewing license, Guinness became a multinational company. The text states: ""250 taona taty aoriana, Guinness dia lasa orinasa iraisam-pirenena..."" which translates to ""250 years later, Guinness became a multinational company..."".
"
Tokony ho firy miliara dolara no miditra amin’ny Guinness isan-taona?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The passage states that Guinness makes $14.7 billion dollars per year.  The closest option to that is 14 billion dollars."
Firenena tao amin’ny Vondrona Eoropeana firy no fantatra fa nisy viriosy H5N1?,"The correct answer is **C: Fito**.

The text states: ""I Frantsa no firenena fahafito ao amin’ny Vondrona Eorôpeanina mijaly vokatr’ity tsimokaretina ity ; aorian’i Aotrisy, Alemaina, Slovenia, Bolgaria, Gresy ary Italia.""  This means seven countries in the EU are affected.
"
Taiza no nisian’ny tranga fantatra fa viriosy H5N1 farany?,"The correct answer is **A: Frantsa**.

The text states: ""Ny gripam-borona mahafaty ny olona, H5N1, dia voamarina fa nahafaty gana dia, hita tamin’ny Alatsinainy, tao marshland akaikin’i Lyon any atsinanan’i **Frantsa**."" (The deadly bird flu, H5N1, has been confirmed to have killed a goose, found on Monday in a marshland near Lyon in eastern **France**.)"
Oviana no nisian’ny aretina farany tao Haiti nialoha ny fielezana nateraky ny mpampandry tany?,"The correct answer is **A: Tamin’ny taona 1800s**.

The text states: ""Talohan’ny nahatongavan’ny tafika, dia tsy nanana olana mifandray amin’ny aretina i Haiti hatramin’ny taona 1800."" (Before the arrival of the troops, Haiti did not have any disease problems until the year 1800.)
"
Fako avy amin’ny toerana taiza no nahatonga ny fiparitahan’ny aretina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny renirano Artibonite**.

The text states that the bacteria caused by the UN troops' waste contaminated the Artibonite River, which is a major river in Haiti.
"
Inona no kasain’ny governemanta Irlandey ho atao?,"The correct answer is **B: Mampiditra lalàna henjana kokoa amin’ny fahazoa-mampiasa rongony.**

Here's why:

* The text states the government is ""manamafy ny mahamaika ny fandaniana lalàna parlemantera ny governemanta irlandey mba hanitsiana ny zava-misy."" This implies they are trying to *correct* a situation, likely by making existing laws stricter.
* The mention of concerns about public health and judicial processes due to the rapid changes suggests the government is trying to reinforce control and prevent further issues.
* The Minister of Health's concerns specifically focus on the health risks associated with the current situation regarding drug use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mizara fiampangana amin’ireo mpandika lalàna amin’ny rongony:** While this *could* be part of the overall strategy, the text doesn't explicitly state this.  It's more about adjusting the laws themselves.
* **C: Fanalefahana lalàna amin’ny fahazoa-mampiasa zava-mahadomelina:** This is the opposite of what the government seems to be doing. They're trying to *fix* the problem, not legalize it.
* **D: Fanafoanana ny maha-heloka ny zava-mahadomelina:**  Again, this is the opposite of the government's apparent actions.



"
Inona no ara-dalàna vonjimaika tao Irlandy?,"The correct answer is **D: Zava-mahadomelina (Drugs)**.

The text mentions ""akora voakasika"" (drugs) and ""zava-mahadomelina"" (drugs) as being affected by the changes to the law. The Minister of Health expresses concern about the health of people who rely on the temporary legal status of these drugs. Therefore, the temporary legal status refers to drugs.
"
Inona no amotorana ilay ahiahiana?,"The correct answer is **B: Fanimban-javatra (Misrepresentation)**.

Here's why:

* **Fanimban-javatra** means misrepresentation or alteration. The description says the sign was altered by changing the color of the letters and slightly modifying one letter. This falls directly under the definition of misrepresentation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Fihoaram-pefy** (Defamation) - This involves damaging someone's reputation. The text doesn't mention any damage to reputation.
* **Hetraketraka** (Harassment) - This refers to unwanted and persistent behavior. There's no mention of this in the text.
* **Halatra** (Theft) - The text explicitly states the investigation is *not* for theft.



Therefore, **Fanimban-javatra** is the most accurate description of the alteration to the sign.
"
"Rehefa nanova ny afisy, inona no tsy nataon’ilay ahiahiana?","The correct answer is **A: Nanova ny iray amin’ny tarehintsorany**

Here's why:

The question asks what the suspect *didn't* do when modifying the poster. The text states the suspect used a light blue marker to make changes, adding a heart, and changing the ""O"" to an ""e"". This implies he *did* modify his face on the poster.

Therefore, the option that states he *didn't* do is ""Nanova ny iray amin’ny tarehintsorany"" (didn't change one of his facial features).
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy niampangana ilay mpampianatra anglisy Karno?","The correct answer is **B: Fampiarahana tamin’ny mpianatra (Communication with students)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states criticisms against Karno regarding:**
    * Using inappropriate language (offensive to parents, using bad words).
    * Using unauthorized promotional materials (car with promotional images).
    * Copyright infringement.
    * Using ""childish language"" and ""mimicking students"".

* **The text doesn't mention any accusations of Karno having issues with communication *with* students.** It focuses on his interactions *in* the classroom and his other professional conduct.

Therefore, option B is the only one that is *not* supported by the information provided in the text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no tsy nataon’i Rolando Mendoza takalon’aina?","The correct answer is **A: Mpizaha tany**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists in Manila.  It also mentions that tourists were injured and some killed.  The question asks what Mendoza *didn't* do to tourists.  Since he shot at them, he didn't *rescue* them.  The other options are all things mentioned in the passage in relation to the incident."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza tamin’ireto natao takalon’aina ireto no tsy voamarina fa navotsitra mialoha?","The correct answer is **A: Ny mpizaha tany (The tourist)**.

The text states that ""Takalon’aina enina, izay nanisana ankizy sy be antitra no navotsotra mialoha, torak'izany koa ireo mpakasary filipianina."" (Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first, as were Filipino diplomats.)  It does *not* mention the tourist being released early.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no nanangon-tsonia ho fanohanana ny fametrahana ho ara-dalàna ny fanambadian’ny mitovy taovam-pananahana ao Brezily?","The correct answer is **C: Ny Eglizy Katolika Apostolika Romana**.

The text states: ""Manantena ireo mpitokona fa ahangona fangatahana misy sonia antapitrisa izy ireo izay haseho ny Kaongresy Nasionaly amin’ny Novambra."" (They hope to gather a petition with a million signatures which will be presented to the National Congress in November.)  The question asks *who* is gathering this petition *in support* of legalizing same-sex marriage. The text implies that the religious groups (including the Catholic Church) are behind the petition.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mpanao fihetsiketsehana (Activist)** - While activists might be involved, the text doesn't specifically mention them as the ones gathering the petition.
* **B: Roberto Jefferson** - Roberto Jefferson is mentioned as having the bill currently, but not as the one gathering support for it.
* **D: Marta Suplicy** - Marta Suplicy drafted the initial bill, but the text doesn't say she is gathering signatures to support its legalization.

Therefore, the most logical inference is that the Catholic Church (the ""mpitokona"" or ""religious groups"") are the ones hoping to gather the petition.
"
Iza no homen’ny mpanao fihetsiketsehana ny angon-tsonian-dry zareo?,"The correct answer is **B: Roberto Jefferson**.

The text states: ""Rehefa namboarina ilay vinavinan-dalàna dia eo am-pelatanan’i Roberto Jefferson izy amin’izao."" This translates to ""When the bill was revised, it is now under the attention of Roberto Jefferson.""
"
"Araka ny kaontin’i Armand Versace, inona no nitranga avy hatrany talohan’ny nanombohan’ny hetsika momba ny toetrandro nataon’ny vondron’olona?","The correct answer is **C: Nisy rivotra mahery (There was strong wind)**.

The text states: ""Dimy minitra taty aoriana, nahatratra 70km isan’ora ny rivotra..."" which translates to ""One minute later, the wind reached 70km/h..."". This happened *before* the heavy rain and flooding. Therefore, strong wind preceded the other events.
"
"Araka an’i Versace, oviana no nanomboka ny rivotra mafy indrindra?","The correct answer is **A: Minitra vitsy taorian’ny nanombohan’ny fampisehoana**

The passage states: ""Dimy minitra tao amin’ny fampisehoana dia nanomboka nifofo ny rivotra..."" which translates to ""Two minutes into the show, the wind started to blow...""  The following sentence says the wind reached 70km/h ""iray minitra taty aoriana"", meaning ""one minute later"".  Therefore, the strong wind began one minute after the show started.
"
"Talohan’i Fred, firy ny tadio lehibe voarakitra tany antsinanana 35°W?","The correct answer is **B: Telo (Three)**.

The text states: ""izy no rivodoza lehibe fahatelo voarakitra tany atsinanan’ny 35°W.""  This translates to: ""it is the third largest tropical cyclone recorded west of 35°W."" Therefore, there were two other tropical cyclones recorded west of 35°W before Fred.



"
"Raha hita nanakaiky ny nosy Cap-Vert i Fred, nankaiza moa ny fizotrany?","The correct answer is **A: Andrefana**.

The question states that Fred is currently heading northwest and is located 645 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands. Therefore, if Fred reaches the Cape Verde Islands, its path will be **westward**.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no haingam-pandeha kokoa noho ireo nialoha azy?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

Here's why:

* **802.11n** is specifically mentioned as having a theoretical maximum speed of 600Mbit/s, which is faster than the previous standards.
* **802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g** all have significantly lower theoretical maximum speeds (typically around 11Mbit/s to 54Mbit/s).

Therefore, 802.11n is the fastest option listed."
Inona no ilaina mba ho rétrocompatible amin’ny 802.11b ny 802.11n?,"The correct answer is **D: Radio roasosona (Radio antennas)**.

Here's why:

*   **Retrocompatibility** means being able to work with older standards. To be compatible with 802.11b, the 802.11n device needs to support the older 2.4 GHz radio band used by 802.11b.
*   The question states that 802.11n utilizes both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz bands and needs two radio antennas for this.  One antenna would be for the 2.4 GHz band (to maintain compatibility with 802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g) and the other for the 5.0 GHz band.
*   The other options are incorrect:
    *   **A: Hafainganana malaky kokoa (Faster speeds)** - While 802.11n has faster speeds, this isn't what's required for backward compatibility.
    *   **B: Ny fahafahan’ny 802.11b miasa amin’ny 5.0Ghz (The ability of 802.11b to work on 5.0Ghz)** - 802.11b only operates on the 2.4 GHz band.
    *   **C: Fisosana 600Mbit/s (600Mbit/s throughput)** - This is the theoretical maximum speed of 802.11n, not a requirement for backward compatibility.



Therefore, the need for **radio antennas** to support both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz is what enables the 802.11n device to be retrocompatible with older 802.11 standards like 802.11b."
Fifaninana firy no tokony ilomanosan’ny mahazo medaly volamena olaimpika any amin’ny Lalaon’ny Commonwealth?,"The answer is **B: Telo**.

The question states that Nahazo ny medaly volamena izy tamin’ny lomano tsotra 100m sy 200m ary tamin’ny relais intelo nandritra ny lalaon’i Commonwealth. This means he won gold in three events. Therefore, the correct answer is **Telo**.
"
Naninona no tsy nihinam-panafody tamin’ny maharary azy ilay nahazo medaly volamena olaimpika?,"The correct answer is **D: Tsy mamela izany ny lalaon’ny Commonwealth** (The Commonwealth Games don't allow it).

The original text states that his doping was questioned because of his performance. It also says he wasn't allowed to take the medication he needed to manage his pain *because of the Games*. This implies the Commonwealth Games have rules against certain medications, or a drug testing policy that prevented him from taking his medication.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsy nahare maharary izy** (He wasn't sick): The text explicitly mentions he was in pain (""fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanaintainan’ny fanain"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mety niteraka fisavorovoroan-tsaina momba ny fihovitrovitry ny tany?","The correct answer is **A: Ny fisian’ny rahona mainty (The presence of the hot rocks)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that ""Rahona mainty tsy misy ifandraisany amin’ny fihetsehan’ny volikano no hita teo am-pototr’ilay tendrombohitra."" (Hot rocks unrelated to volcanic activity were found on the slopes of the mountain.)
* The text also mentions that these rocks caused confusion about whether a real eruption had occurred.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Tatitra avy amin’ny Ofisin’ny Toetrandro islandey (Reports from the Icelandic Met Office)** - While the Met Office reported no recent volcanic activity, it's the *hot rocks* that caused the confusion.
* **C: Ny sarintanin’ny fihovitrovitry ny tany iraisampirenena (The international seismic map)** - The map's information is confirmed by the other reports but isn't the *cause* of the confusion.
* **D: Asa notaterina tany amin’ny faritra hafa ao Islandy (Work carried out in other areas of Iceland)** - This is irrelevant to the situation described.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, oviana no nitrangan’ny fiovan-dingana?","The correct answer is **C: Tamin’ny 10 marsa**.

The text states: ""Hetsika horohorontany goavana niafara tamin’ny fiovana dingana dia niseho tamin’ny 10 Martsa..."" which translates to ""A major seismic event ended with a step change on March 10th...""
"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ny saondim-bolana Chandrayaan-1 ireto no tsy marina?,"The incorrect statement is **D: Niloko ny sisin’ny saondy (Painted the edges of the orbiter)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""nitondra ihany koa ny sarin’ny sainam-pirenena Indiana, voaloko teo amin’ny lafiny rehetra"" - which translates to ""also carried the image of the Indian national emblem, painted on all sides"".
* **The text says it was painted *on all sides*,** not just the edges.  The question asks specifically about *the edges* of the orbiter.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Nanana ekipa ilay ôrbitera nandefa saondy (The orbiter had a team that deployed the probe):** The question states the MIP was deployed from the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter.
* **B: Nitondra fitaovana iankinan’ny ain-dehibe ilay saondy (The probe carried important scientific instruments):** The text explicitly mentions the MIP carried three important scientific instruments.
* **C: Nahomby ny fanapitihana ny saondy (The probe successfully landed):** The text says the MIP successfully landed near the south pole of the moon.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra marina ny saondim-bolana?,"The correct answer is **A: Nitody akaikin’ny tendro avaratry ny Volana izy io** (It orbited near the southern pole of the Moon).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...and successfully landed near the southern pole of the Moon.""  Option A reflects this information.
* Option B is incorrect because the passage describes the probe *orbiting* the moon, not landing on Earth.
* Option C is incorrect because the passage specifically states the probe was unmanned (""without people"").
* Option D is incorrect because the passage mentions three scientific instruments, not two.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona amin’ny fepetra fiarovana amin’ny aretina no hampiharina farany?","The correct answer is **C: Vakisinin’ny fivontosan'atidoha (Brain vaccine)**.

The text states: ""Tavoahangy kelina vaksinin’ny aretin’ny ati-doha an-tapitrisany maro ihany koa no nampanantenain’ny governemanta, izay hanampy amin’ny fanomanana sampandraharaha ara-pahasalamana amin’ny herintaona.""  This translates to: ""Thousands of vials of brain vaccines were also promised by the government, which will help in preparing health agencies for the year.""

While the other options (Brain Poision, Mosquito collectors, and Aroma traps) are measures taken, the text explicitly mentions the promise of a brain vaccine as a final preventative measure.



"
Ahoana no fomba ifindran’ny aretina amin’ny olombelona?,"The correct answer is **D: Fisamboran-kisoa**.

The passage states: ""Entin’ny kisoa ilay aretina, ary mifindra amin’ny olona amin’ny alalan’ny moka."" This translates to ""The disease is carried by ticks, and spreads to people through ticks."" Therefore, the disease is transmitted by ticks (fisamboran-kisoa).
"
Mety mitondra mankaiza moa ny tsi-fahombiazan’ny didim-pitsarana faharoa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny fandrarana ny firaisana sivilin’ny mitovy taovam-pananahana**

Here's why:

The passage states that the failure of the second amendment (HJR-3) could ""open doors for the registration of those with similar affiliations.""  This implies that the failure could lead to restrictions or prohibitions on civil associations of people with similar backgrounds/beliefs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ny fijerena avy hatrany indray ny HJR-3** - The passage says HJR-3 will be reviewed again in 2015 or 2016, not immediately after the failure of the second amendment.
*   **B: Ny zo hoavin’ny firaisana sivilin’ny mitovy taovam-pananahana** -  The passage suggests the *opposite* might happen – a restriction, not an advancement of civil associations.
*   **C: Fotoam-pivoriana maika ho an’ny mpanao lalàna** -  The passage doesn't indicate the failure will lead to shorter review periods.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, oviana no namafana ny didim-pitsarana faharoa?","The correct answer is **C: Ny alatsinainy**.

The text states: ""avy eo nekena tanatina endrika mitovy tao amin’ny Antenimieran-doholona ny Alatsinainy."" which translates to ""and then it was approved in the same form in the Parliament on Monday.""
"
Tamin’iza no niporitsahan’ny “Panama Papers”?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny gazety**.

The passage states: "" izay navoaka tamin’ny gazety nandritran’ny lohataona 2016."" which translates to ""which were leaked to the press during 2016.""  While the documents originated from Mossack Fonseca, it was the press that *released* them.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no nolazain’ny gazety britanika fa nitantana ny ankamaroan’ireo orinasa nampiasaina hanafenana harena?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Bank**.

The text states: ""Nilaza ny gazety britanika The Guardian fa mifehy ny ampahatelon’ireo orinasa sarintsariny miisa 1.200 nampiasaina hanatontosana izao ny Deutsche Bank."" This translates to: ""The British newspaper The Guardian said that Deutsche Bank controls three quarters of the 1,200 shell companies used to carry out this.""
"
Iza amin’ireo lozam-piaramanidina manaraka ireto no nisian’ny fahafatesan’olona maro indrindra?,"The correct answer is **A: Fianjeran’ny voromby teny an-dalana ho any Armenia avy any Iran**.

The text states: ""Tamin’io volana io ihany, nianjera ny zotram-piaramanidina iray nihazo an’i Armenia, ka nahafaty ny olona 168 tao anatiny."" (In that same month, an airplane crashed en route to Armenia, killing 168 people inside). This is the highest death toll mentioned among the options.

The other options have lower death tolls:

*   **B: Fianjeran’ny angidimbin’ny polisy:** 3 fatalities
*   **D: Ny fianjeran’ny voromby tao Mashad:** 7 out of 10 fatalities
*   **C: Ny fianjeran’ny voromby teny an-dalana ho ao Iran avy any Armenia:** No death toll is mentioned.

Therefore, option A is the only one with a high death toll."
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy antony mahatonga ny fahamaroan’ny loza an’habakabaka maro mitranga any Iran?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny tsy fikojakojana ireo andiam-piaramanidina** (Lack of aircraft maintenance).

Here's why:

* **A: Andiam-piaramanidina sivily sy miaramila efa antitra:** This is a direct cause mentioned in the prompt. Old aircraft are more prone to mechanical failures.
* **B: Tsy fahampian’ny tetibola ahafahana mividy fiaramanidina vaovao:** The prompt states that international sanctions prevent Iran from buying new aircraft, which limits their ability to replace old ones.  A lack of funds is a contributing factor.
* **C: Fanasaziana tsy ahafahana mividy fiaramanidina vaovao:** This is a consequence of the sanctions, not a direct cause of the accidents.
* **D: Ny tsy fikojakojana ireo andiam-piaramanidina:** This is a very likely cause of the accidents. Even modern aircraft require regular and thorough maintenance. If maintenance is lacking, the risk of accidents increases significantly, especially in older aircraft.

While all options are related to the problem, **lack of maintenance** is a fundamental reason that exacerbates the danger of operating older aircraft.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy hita tao anaty tatitra momba ny Vondrona Mpamakafaka an’i Iràka?,"The correct answer is **B: Fanambarana fa raha misy ny fanovana maromaro dia azo sorohina ny herisetra mitombo ao Iràka.**

Here's why:

* The report explicitly states they **cannot guarantee** the cessation of tribal fighting, the reduction of unrest, or a large-scale descent into chaos. This directly contradicts the idea that significant changes *could* prevent unrest from escalating.
* The report *does* call for a new diplomatic decision to protect Iraq's borders and re-establish diplomatic ties, which aligns with option C.
* The report *does* criticize the current administration's policies towards Iraq and calls for a change in leadership, which aligns with option A.
* The report *does* mention the US's open dialogue and search for a global consensus on policy towards the Middle East, aligning with option D.



Therefore, option B is the only statement *not* found in the report."
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy nangatahan’ny Vondrona Mpamakafaka an’i Iràka tao anaty tatitra nataony?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny fanovana zotra avy hatrany (Immediate shift in strategy)**.

Here's why:

The text states the report *calls for new diplomatic decisions to be made by the end of the year to protect Iraq's borders from invasion and re-establish diplomatic relations with its international partners*.  This implies a *planned* shift in strategy, not an immediate one. 

The report *does* call for:

*   **A: Mba hisy ny antoka amin’ny fanambarana momba ny fampitsaharana ny herisetra mitombo (Assurance of halting the escalating violence)** -  The report acknowledges the escalating violence and calls for halting it.
*   **C: Ny fampiasaina ny adihevitra misokatra (Use of open dialogue)** -  The report mentions the need for open dialogue.
*   **D: Ny fametrahana hetsika diplaomatika vaovao (Establishment of new diplomatic action)** - The report specifically calls for new diplomatic decisions.



Therefore, the immediate shift in strategy is the one *not* advocated for in the report.



"
"Araka ny filazan’ny polisy, iza ilay heverina fa tanan-kavanan’i Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nanambara ny polisy fa natanjaka kokoa i Lo Piccolo satria izy no tanana an-kavanan’i Provenzano tany Palerma..."" which translates to ""The police stated that Lo Piccolo was strengthened because he was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo...""
"
"Araka ny fampahalalana nomena, inona no antony nahafaty an’i Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Maty nandritra ny ady notarihan’i Riina izy**.

The text states: ""ny ady notarihan’i Riina tamin’ny Fanjakana izay namoizana ny ain’ireo mpiady mafia Giovanni Falcone sy Paolo Borsellino ny taona 1992."" which translates to ""the war led by Riina within the State that claimed the lives of mafia fighters Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: The text says the police were *investigating* the high-ranking officials, not that they killed Falcone.
*   C: The text mentions Lo Piccolo as being strong and trusted by Provenzano, but it doesn't say he ordered Falcone's murder.
*   D: The text states that Falcone and Borsellino were killed *together* during the war against Riina, not that Borsellino killed Falcone.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ao anatin’ny fankasitrahana azon’i Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **D: Kalazalahy amin’ny judo** (Judo Legend).

Here's why:

* **A: Tompondaka manerantany indroa** (Double World Champion) - The text states he was a double World Champion.
* **B: Filohan’ny komitin’ny Federasionan’ny Judo Japoney** (Chairman of the Japanese Judo Federation Committee) - The text explicitly states he was the chairman.
* **C: Medaly volamena olaimpika indro** (Double Olympic Gold Medal) - The text states he won two Olympic gold medals.
* **D: Kalazalahy amin’ny judo** (Judo Legend) - While he was undoubtedly a legend, the text *doesn't explicitly state* he was called a ""Judo Legend"".  The other options are directly mentioned as accomplishments.

Therefore, D is the only option not mentioned in the provided text.
"
Taiza i Iwasaki no nahavita tsy niteny voady?,"The correct answer is **A: Japon**.

The text says ""Nandritra ny diany, dia nisedra olana imbetsaka i Iwasaki. Norobain’ny jiolahintsambo izy..."" This translates to ""During his travels, Iwasaki experienced many problems. He was robbed by jewel thieves..."" The text then goes on to mention his travels to Tibet, Nepal, and India, but the first part explicitly states that he was robbed *during his travels*.  The question asks *where* he faced problems - the first part of the sentence places that in Japan (as he was robbed by jewel thieves, implying a location where those thieves operate). The following sentences details his adventures but the initial phrase implies the origin of the problem was Japan.
"
Iza no nanafika an’i Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny mety ho vadiny (His alleged wife)**.

The text states he ""nandositra fanambadiana tany Nepala"" which translates to ""fled from his alleged wife to Nepal"".  The other options are incorrect.
"
Oviana i Alonso no namarana ny hazakazany?,"The correct answer is **A: Taorian’ny nanimban’i Schumacher ny kodiarany ao aloha**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tsy nifarana tsy ela taorian'i Alonso ny hazakazaka am-piarakodia nataon'i Michael Schumacher, noho ny fahasimban’ny suspension tamin’ny ady maro nandritra ny hazakazaka."" This translates to: ""Not long after Alonso finished the race, Michael Schumacher finished the race due to suspension damage from many collisions during the race.""

Therefore, Alonso finished the race *before* Schumacher. Option A accurately reflects this sequence of events.
"
Inona no antony nahatonga an’i Schumacher namarana mialoha ny hazakazany?,"The correct answer is **D: Fahasimbana tamin’ny suspension an’ny fiara**.

The text clearly states: ""Tsy ela taorian'i Alonso ny hazakazaka am-piarakodia nataon'i Michael Schumacher, noho ny **fahasimban’ny suspension** tamin’ny ady maro nandritra ny hazakazaka."" (Not long after Alonso's race, Michael Schumacher finished the race due to a **suspension failure** during the many collisions of the race.)



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tsy voafehiny ny fiarany** (He couldn't drive his car): This is incorrect because the text says Fisichella had no power, not that Schumacher couldn't drive.
*   **B: Fifandonana tamin’i Alonso** (Collision with Alonso): While collisions happened, the text doesn't state that a collision with Alonso directly caused Schumacher to finish early.
*   **C: Fahasimban'ny kodiarana noho ny nataon’i Fisichella** (Tire failure due to Fisichella's actions):  The text says Fisichella had tire issues, but it explicitly states Schumacher's issue was a suspension failure.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tamin’ny volana Avrilin’ity taona ity dia namoaka didy vonjimaika famerana ilay toerana ny Mpitsara Glynn mba hampiharana ny famoahana an’ireo olona voatazona mihoatra ny 24 ora taorian’ny nampidirana azy kanefa tsy nalain'ny kaomiseran'ny fitsaràna am-bavany.""  This indicates that Judge Glynn issued a temporary order, implying he has authority over the Central Booking facility.

The text also mentions: ""Ny kaomisera dia mametraka ny sazy aloa, raha ekena, ary manoratra amin’ny fomba ofisialy ireo fiampangana nataon’ilay mpitandro nanao ny fisamborana."" This describes the process *after* the arrest, not who determines the bail money initially.  The bail money determination happens *because* of the Judge's order.

Therefore, the Judge is the one who sets the conditions (like the bail) after a temporary order is issued.



"
"Araka ny didim-panalavirana vonjimaika voalaza ao amin'ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy maintsy avela hananan’ireo voasambotra hotanan’izy ireo mihoatra ny 24 ora?","The correct answer is **D: Fotoam-pitsarana**.

The text states: ""Tamin’ny volana Avrilin’ity taona ity dia namoaka didy vonjimaika famerana ilay toerana ny Mpitsara Glynn mba hampiharana ny famoahana an’ireo olona voatazona mihoatra ny 24 ora taorian’ny nampidirana azy kanefa tsy nalain'ny kaomiseran'ny fitsaràna am-bavany."" This means the temporary order was to release people detained *more than 24 hours* after being brought in.  The implication is that the length of time they could be held without a charge or court appearance was limited to 24 hours.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona ny antony tsy nampiasaina hanazavana an’ilay fihodinana faharoa nofoanana?","The correct answer is **A: Tsy filaminana (Insecurity)**.

The passage states that Lodin and officials decided to cancel the second round of voting to avoid Afghan people from facing expenses and **insecurity** in subsequent elections. While expenses are mentioned, the primary reason highlighted is insecurity. The passage also explicitly contradicts previous reports about the cancellation not aligning with the constitution, so option B is incorrect. Option C (expenses) is related but not the main reason emphasized. Option D (double action in the constitution) is not mentioned at all.
"
Nahoana ilay fihodinana faharoa no nofaritan’ireo mpanao politika ho tsy nilaina ihany?,"The correct answer is **B: Natahorana ny hisian’ny tsy filaminana**.

The passage states: ""Lodin fa nanapa-kevitra ireo tomponandraikitra ny hanafoana ny fiodinana faharoa mba hialan’ny mponina Afghan amin’ny fandaniana sy **tsy filaminana** amin’ny fifidianana hafa indray.""  This directly links the decision to cancel the second round to concerns about instability and safety.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nandika ny lalàm-panorenana ilay izy:** The passage *contradicts* this, stating the cancellation is *not* in accordance with the constitution, unlike previous reports.
* **C: Nisy hevi-droa tao amin’ny lalàm-panorenana:** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Lafo loatra ilay fifidianana:**  While cost might be a factor, the passage focuses on safety and instability as the primary reasons.
"
Iza no manome serivisy mifandray amin’ny fitsarana ho an’ny FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Masoivoho Politika**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nanomboka tamin’ny fahaleovantenan’i Pakistan nialany tamin’ny fifehezan’ny britanika tamin’ny taona 1947 dia nanendry “masoivoho politika” ny filoham-pirenena pakistaney mba hitantana ny FATA...""  This directly links the Political Agents (masoivoho politika) with the responsibility of managing the FATA and providing services related to the government and judiciary, as per Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution.
"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ireo “Masoivoho Politika” an’ny FATA ireto no tsy marina?,"The incorrect statement is **D: Manana fifehezana tanteraka amin’ny faritra sasany izy ireo (They have complete control over certain areas).**

Here's why:

* The passage states that these ""political eyes"" were tasked with managing the FATA to achieve *self-rule*. This implies they were working *towards* full autonomy, not *currently* having complete control. The FATA has historically had a unique status within Pakistan, and complete control hasn't been a reality.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Manolotra serivisy ara-pitsarana izy ireo (They provide judicial services):** The passage explicitly mentions they provide services related to government and judiciary.
* **B: Nofantenan’ny Filoham-pirenena pakistaney izy ireo (They were appointed by the President of Pakistan):** The passage states the President appointed them to head the FATA.
* **C: Manaraka ny lalàm-panorenan’i Pakistan izy ireo (They follow the Constitution of Pakistan):** The passage mentions their duties are in accordance with Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution.



Therefore, the answer is **D**."
Inona ny mari-pankasitrahana naha voatendry an’i Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Mpilalao sarimihetsika vavy tsara indrindra**.

The text states: ""Nahazo fanendrena ho mpilalao sarimihetsika lahy sy vavy **tsara indrindra** i Gosling sy i Stone."" This directly translates to Emma Stone winning the award for Best Actress.
"
Inona ny mari-pankasitrahana naha voatendry an’ilay sarimihetsika?,"The correct answer is **A: Horonantsary tsara indrindra**.

The passage states that the film received nominations in ""Horonantsary tsara indrindra"" (Best Picture). While other awards are mentioned, ""Horonantsary tsara indrindra"" is listed first and is a major award.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no mbola nandeha taorian’ilay horohoron-tany?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny seranampiaramanidina any Ishikawa**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""ny seranampiaramanidina Noto any amin’ny prefektioran’i Ishikawa kosa mbola mikatona."" (The Noto airport in Ishikawa prefecture remains closed.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ireo reaktera rehetra an’ny orinasa Hokuriku any Shika:** The text says reactors 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear plant were shut down.  It doesn't say *all* reactors.
* **C: Ny tolotra fitaterana an-dalamby rehetra:** The text mentions *some* road closures, not all.
* **D: Foibe famokarana angovo any Niigata:** The text explicitly states that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa plant in Niigata is operating normally.



Therefore, only the closure of the Noto airport in Ishikawa prefecture is stated as happening *after* the earthquake.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no nisy fahasimbana vokatr’ilay horohoron-tany?","The correct answer is **A: Trano sasany**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states ""eo amin’ny tokantrano 9400 any amin’ny faritra no tsy manana rano"" (in 9400 households in the area there is no water) and ""eo ho eo amin’ny 100 no tsy manana jiro"" (approximately 100 have no electricity).  This directly relates to homes/houses.
* While the reactors at Shika were shut down (B), the text says they were ""novonoina"" (shut down), not damaged.
* The road closures (C) are mentioned as a consequence of the earthquake, not a direct result *of* the earthquake's impact.
* The airport closure (D) is also a consequence, not a direct impact of the earthquake.

Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text is that some houses were affected.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto olana manaraka ireto no tsy tafiditra ao amin’ilay antontan-taratasy?","The correct answer is **B: Ny anton’ny ady tamin’ny 1967**.

Here's why:

The text states the document refers to a potential border war *before* the 1967 Six-Day War. It also mentions the future of Jerusalem and the Jordan River issue, as well as a proposal for troop withdrawal from the West Bank. However, it doesn't discuss the *causes* of the 1967 war itself.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy anisan’ireo fangatahan’i Palestina?,"The correct answer is **B: Fijanonan’ny tafika mitohy ao amin’ny Lohasaha Jordana**.

Here's why:

* The question states that the news reports indicate Palestinians are demanding a border based on the pre-1967 borders. 
* It also mentions concerns about Jerusalem and the Jordan River Valley.
* **Crucially, it states that Israel is proposing a 10-year ceasefire in the Jordan River Valley, with the PA agreeing to only 2 years.**
* Option B states that Palestinians want the *continued* presence of troops in the Jordan River Valley.  This is the opposite of what the provided information suggests Palestinians are requesting (a ceasefire).

Therefore, option B is the one that is *not* part of the Palestinian demands according to the text.
"
Taiza ny firenena nianaran’i Ma lalàna?,"The correct answer is **A: Etazonia**.

The text states that Ma studied at Columbia University and Harvard Law School, both located in the United States.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, fanandratana ny firenena inona no nanampy ny fandresen’i Ma tamin’ny fifidianana?","The correct answer is **D: Sina**.

The text states that Ma ""consistently won in areas that extended the estrangement between China and the United States."" This indicates that the estrangement with China *helped* Ma win elections. Therefore, the answer is China.
"
"Araka ny voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, niasa ho an’iza i Carolyn Wilson talohan’ny nialany tao an-tanana?","The correct answer is **C: Ny OHA**.

The text states that Carolyn Wilson ""avy ao amin’ny OHA"" (from OHA) and that she ""nangalarin’i Carolyn Wilson avy ao amin’ny OHA ny antoka"" (Carolyn Wilson stole the documents from OHA).

"Amin’izao hazakazaka efatra sisa tavela amin’ny taompilalaovana izao, iza no eo amin’ny laharana fahefatra amin’ny Tompondakan’ny Mpamily?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

Here's how we know:

The problem states: ""Eo amin’ny laharana fahatelo, i Hamlin dia isa roapolo any aoriana, fa isa dimy eo alohan’i Bowyer."" (In third place, Hamlin is twenty places behind, but five places ahead of Bowyer).

This means Bowyer is in fourth place."
"Taorian’ilay hazakazaka voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, isa firy no ananan’i Kahne amin’ny Tompondakan’ny Mpamily?","The correct answer is **A: 2.220**.

The text states: ""Kahne sy Truex, Jr. dia fahadimy sy fahenina miaraka amin’ny isa 2.220 sy 2.207."" This directly tells us that Kahne has 2,220 points.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, impiry no nisy olona nahatsikaritra meteorita nilatsaka, izay voamarina aty aoriana fa avy amin’ny planeta Marsa?","The correct answer is **C: In-dimy ambin’ny folo**.

The text states: ""Tamin’ireo meteorita 24 000 eo ho eo fantatra fa nilatsaka tety ambonin’ny tany dia 34 monja no voamarina fa avy amin’ny planeta Marsa."" This translates to ""Among the approximately 24,000 meteorites known to have fallen to Earth, only 34 were confirmed to be from the planet Mars.""  The question asks how many people *noticed* these Martian meteorites, and the answer in the text is 34, which is ""in-dimy ambin’ny folo"" (a little less than ten).  Option C accurately reflects this.
"
"Araka ny voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona ny marina momba an’ireo vato izay hita fa avy amin’ny planeta Mars?","The correct answer is **D: Miisa 34 izy ireo**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Tamin’ireo meteorita 24 000 eo ho eo fantatra fa nilatsaka tety ambonin’ny tany dia 34 monja no voamarina fa avy amin’ny planeta Marsa."" (Of the approximately 24,000 meteorites known to have fallen to Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to be from the planet Mars.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Izy rehetra dia hita nandritra ny firarahan’ny tainkintana tamin’ny Jolay** - While 10 out of the 34 are from the July meteor shower, not *all* of them are.
* **B: Miisa 24.000 izy ireo** - This is the total number of meteorites found, not the number confirmed to be Martian.
* **C: 11.000$ mihoatra noho ny vidin’ny volamena ny sandan’izy ireo** - The text states they are sold for 11,000 $ to 22,500 $ *per ounce*, which is *ten times* the price of gold, not *more* than the price of gold.
"
Tamin’ny oviana i Schumacher no nisotro ronona?,"The correct answer is **A: Taorian’ny lozam-pifamoivoizana nahazo an’i Felipe Massa**.

The text clearly states: ""I Schumacher izay nisotro ronono tamin’ny taona 2006 **taorian’ny nibatany ny tompon-dakan’ny Formule 1 im-pito no tokony nisolo an’i Felipe Massa izay naratra**."" (Schumacher, who took the lead in 2006 after his seventh championship, was supposed to replace Felipe Massa who was injured.) The context indicates the doping happened *after* Massa's injury."
Tamin’ny oviana i Massa no naratra?,"The correct answer is **A: Nandritra ny Grand Prix iray**.

The text states: ""I Felipe Massa dia naratra mafy teo amin’ny lohany ilay Brezilianina taoriana lozam-pifamoivoizana nandritra ny Hungarian Grand Prix tamin’ny 2009.""  This directly translates to ""Felipe Massa was seriously injured in a car accident during the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009.""

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no ho vokatr’ilay fiaraha-miasa napetraka amin’i AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Ny isan’ny mpampiasa AOL dia hifanandrina amin’ny isan’ny mpampiasa Yahoo sy Microsoft.**

The text explicitly states: ""Miaraka amin’ity fiaraha-miasa napetraka ity , mety ho foana ity fahalalahana ity. **Hifanandrina amin’ny isan’ny mpampiasa AOL ny isan’ny mpampiasa an’ireo taoraharaha Yahoo! sy Microsoft mitambatra.**"" which translates to ""With this partnership, this trend may be permanent. **The number of AOL users will rival the combined number of Yahoo! and Microsoft users.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hitombo ny isan’ny mpampiasa AOL** - While the partnership might *contribute* to growth, the text doesn't guarantee growth. It focuses on the comparison to competitors.
* **B: AOL no ho hany orinasa hampivoatra ny tsenan’ny IM** - The text says AOL *has* boosted the market, but the partnership implies other companies will also benefit.
* **D: Tsy hampiasaina intsony any Etazonia ny AOL** - This is the opposite of what the text suggests. The partnership is designed to *maintain* and potentially *grow* AOL's user base.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no mety hifarana aorian’ilay fiaraha-miasa vaovao napetraka?,"The correct answer is **B: Fampiasana ny tsenan’ny IM** (Usage of the IM market).

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that AOL's IM market growth was driven by its heavy use in the US.
* The new partnership aims to *continue* this growth, suggesting the usage of the IM market will be sustained.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fampivoarana ny aterineto mivelatra any Etazonia** (Expansion of the internet market in the US): While the partnership might indirectly influence internet usage, the paragraph focuses specifically on the IM market.
* **C: Ny fahalalahan’i AOL hampivoatra ny tsena araka ny hafainganam-pandehany** (AOL's ability to grow the market at its pace): The partnership is intended to *accelerate* growth, not necessarily maintain AOL's previous pace.
* **D: Fiaraha-miasan’i Yahoo sy Microsoft** (Yahoo and Microsoft's partnership):  The paragraph discusses AOL and its IM market, not the partnership between Yahoo and Microsoft.



"
Firy tamin’ireo olona maty tamin’ilay fanafihana no tsy polisy?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The text states that ""more than twenty people were injured, nine of whom were police.""  This means the number of non-police injured is more than 20 - 9 = 11. The question asks for the number of non-police *killed*. The text says ""namono polisy anankiroa ary nandratra olona hafa mihoatra ny roapolo"" (killed two police and injured more than twenty other people).  Since the question asks about the number of non-police *killed*, and the text indicates that 9 out of the 20+ injured were police, then the remaining number were not police. The text doesn't explicitly state the number of non-police killed, but the closest option given the information is 19.

However, it's worth noting the phrasing is a little unclear.  The more accurate interpretation based *strictly* on the provided text is that we *don't know* the number of non-police killed, only that there were more than 20 injured, 9 of whom were police. The question should ideally state ""at least how many..."" rather than ""firy"". Given the options, 19 is the most logical, though not definitively stated.

Given the options provided, let's analyze again. The text says ""more than twenty people were injured.""  It then says ""nine of whom were police"".  This means the number of injured who were *not* police is ""more than 20 - 9 = 11"".  Since the question asks about the number of *killed* who were not police, and we have no information about casualties beyond injuries, the most reasonable inference is that the number of non-police killed is 19, since the text indicates that 9 out of the 20+ injured were police. However, without a definitive statement in the text, this remains an educated guess.
Because there is no information on casualties beyond injuries, and the number of non-police injured is ""more than 11"", it would make sense that the number of non-police killed could be 19, since 9 of the injured were police, and the other 11 were not.

Given the options, the most plausible answer, even with the text's ambiguity, is **A: 19**.
"
Iza no nilaza momba ny tomponandraikitra ahiana amin’ilay fanafihana?,"The correct answer is **A: Polisy**.

The text states: ""Nilaza ny polisy fa miahiahy miaramilan’ny Daesh (ISIL) ho tomponandraikitra tamin’ny fanafihana izy ireo."" (The police said they suspect Daesh (ISIL) militants are responsible for the attack.)
"
"Amin’ny maha fanjakana mpandresy an’i Florida, inona no azon’i Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Ireo solontenam-panjakana rehetra**.

The text states: ""Amin’ny maha-fanjakana mpandresy azy dia nomen’i Florida an’i Romney daholo ireo solontena dimampolo, manosika azy ho lohalaharana eo amin'ireo mpifaninana hofidiana anatin'ny Antoko Repoblikanina."" This translates to: ""As a winning state, Florida gave Romney all ten delegates, thus placing him in the lead among the Republican contenders.""  ""Daholo ireo solontena dimampolo"" means ""all ten delegates"".  The key is the phrase ""daholo ireo"", which means ""all of them"".  

While the other options touch on elements mentioned in the text, they aren't entirely accurate:

*   **A: 32 amin’ireo solontenam-panjakana:** The text mentions 10 delegates, not 32.
*   **B: Ho voafidy amin’ny Antoko Repoblikanina:** While Romney's win gives him a lead within the Republican party, it doesn't *guarantee* he will be elected.
*   **D: 46 isan-jaton’ny vato:** This refers to the percentage of the vote he received, not the delegates he was awarded.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, firy isan-jaton’ny vato no azon’i Gingrich tamin’ny fifidianana savaranonando?","The correct answer is **B: 32 isan-jato**.

The text states: ""Tonga teo amin’ny laharana faharoa tamin’ny isa 32 isan-jato ny Filohan'ny Antenimierampirenena Amerikanina taloha Newt Gingrich."" This translates to: ""He came in second place with 32 percent of the vote.""

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no tsy nanohy ny hazakazaka taorian’ny valin’ny fifidianana ireo solontenan’ny antoko?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no nidera mpilatsaka hofidina iray hafa taorian’ny valin’ny fifidianana ireo solontenan’ny antoko?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Taorian’ny fivoahan’ny vokatra dia nankasitraka an’i Santorum i Gingrich saingy nanome teny mahery ho an’i Romney..."" which translates to ""After the results, Gingrich congratulated Santorum but gave strong words to Romney...""

Therefore, Gingrich offered words of support to Romney.
"
Taiza ihany no toerana nandefasana ilay fandaharana talohan’ny 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The text states: ""Tany am-piandohany, tao amin’ny onjampeo anaty aterineto Tigonet Radio, tranonkala mifantoka amin’ny firesahana an’onjampeo, ihany no nalefa ilay fandaharana."" This translates to ""Initially, the program was only broadcast on the internet radio station Tigonet Radio, a website focused on radio talk."" Therefore, TogiNet Radio was the platform where the program was initially broadcast before 2015.
"
Ilay onjampeo dia manoritsoritra ilay fandaharana ho toy ny manana endrika manao ahoana?,"The correct answer is **B: Geek**.

The text states the website describes the program as a ""new and unusual geek spin on their old radio theater.""
"
Inona no nangonon’i David Headley ka nanampy tamin’ny fanafihan’ilay vondrona mpioko?,"The correct answer is **A: Vaovao (Information)**.

The text states: ""Famantarana sy ny fanangonana vaovao nataon'i David Headley no nanampy ireo lehilahy mitam-basy miisa 10...""  This means David Headley *provided* information that aided the terrorists, not that he provided weapons or was a terrorist himself.
"
Inona ny fomba fifamoivoizana nampiasain’ilay vondrona mpioko mba handehanana tany Mombay?,"The correct answer is **C: Sambo**.

The text states: ""Ireo mpanafika tao Mombay dia tonga an-tsambo..."" which translates to ""The attackers in Mumbai arrived by boat...""

Iza amin’ireto fanambarana ireto no maneho marina ny vokatry ny lalao nataon’i Nadal sy Raonic tamin’ny Brisbane Open voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra?,"The correct answer is **C: Nandresy an’i Raonic i Nadal**.

Here's why:

* The text states, ""7-2 ny tsara indrindra vitan'i Nadal tamin'ny fifanandrinany tamin'ilay Kanadianina."" This means Nadal won 7-2.
*  The statement ""Nahazo 88 %-n'ny isa nanakaiky harato i Nadal..."" tells us about Nadal's performance *during* the match, not the outcome.

Therefore, the match ended with Nadal winning.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, firy ny filaharan’ny lalao nifanandrinan’i Nadal sy Raonic taorian’ny serivisy voalohany?","The correct answer is **B: Nahazo isa 76 i Nadal**.

The text states: ""Nahazo ny 88 %-n'ny isa nanakaiky harato i Nadal, nahazoany 76 isa nandritra ny servisy voalohany."" This directly tells us that Nadal had 76 points during the first serve. Options A, C, and D are incorrect based on the information given.

Fandaharana amin’ny fiteny inona no tsy tafiditra amin’ireo fampielezana Naked News teo vaovao?,"The correct answer is **C: Japoney**.

"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, amin’ny inona no tsy hisy an’ireo fampitam-baovao vaovao an’ny Naked News?","The correct answer is **C: Fampisehoana an-tsehatra**

Here's why:

The passage states the Naked News will launch in Spanish, Italian, and Korean on ""television, website and mobile.""  ""Fampisehoana an-tsehatra"" translates to ""live performance"" or ""theater performance"" which isn't mentioned as a platform. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Finday (Mobile):**  The passage explicitly mentions mobile as a platform.
*   **B: Aterineto (Website):** The passage explicitly mentions the website as a platform.
*   **D: Fahitalavitra (Television):** The passage explicitly mentions television as a platform.

Mpifaninana firy no tsy nahavita ny Slalom Goavana?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The text states: ""Mpisosa an-dranomandry efatra ao amin’ny vondron’ny vehivavy no tsy nahavita ny hazakazany, ary 45 tamin’ireo mpisosa an-dranomandry mitotaly 117 nandrit’ny Slalom Goavana no tsy tafiditra tanatin’ny lohalaharana tamin’ny hazakazaka."" This directly translates to ""Four female water skiers did not complete the race, and 45 of the total 117 water skiers during the Giant Slalom did not finish within the ranking.""

Therefore, 45 water skiers did not finish the Giant Slalom.
"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no maneho marina ny vokatr’ireo hazakazaka tamin’ny Fiadiana ho Tompondaka?,"The correct answer is **B: Mpanao ski 45 no tsy nahavita ny hazakazany tamin’ny Slalom Goavana.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Mpisosa an-dranomandry efatra ao amin’ny vondron’ny vehivavy no tsy nahavita ny hazakazany, ary 45 tamin’ireo mpisosa an-dranomandry mitotaly 117 nandritàny ny Slalom Goavana no tsy tafiditra tanatin’ny lohalaharana tamin’ny hazakazaka."" This directly confirms that 45 skiers did not finish the Slalom Goeva.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tamin’ilay hazakazaka faharoa, dia nahavita ny hazakazaka teo alohan’ny mpanao ski avy any Hongria iray i Carpanedo:** The text says Gyöngyi Dani (from Hungary) finished 9th, so Carpanedo did *not* finish ahead of her.
* **C: Mpanao ski maro kokoa no nahavita ny Slalom Goavana raha oharina amin’ny Slalom:** The text doesn't provide enough information to compare the number of skiers who finished each race. It only mentions the number who *didn't* finish.
* **D: Teo amin’ny laharana fahafolo i Carpenado tamin’ny Slalom:** The text doesn't say Carpanedo finished 10th in the Slalom. It says 3 skiers finished with the same time as Carpanedo, so she did not finish in 10th. She did not finish 10th at all according to the passage.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no naaton’ny NBA?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny taompilalaovana (The season)**.

The text states that the NBA **suspended its season** due to COVID-19 concerns. While the positive test of a player was the catalyst, the overall action was the suspension of the season.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no nahatonga ny NBA hanana ahiahy mikasika ilay tsimokaretina?","The correct answer is **A: Nisy mpikambana ao amin’ny NBA nitondra ilay tsimokaretina.**

The passage states: ""Ny fanapahankevitry ny NBA dia nampiato ny taompilalaovany noho ny ahiahy mikasika ny COVID-19. Nanaraka ny fanamarinana ny mpanao Jazz Utah iray ho mitondra ny tsimokaretina COVID-19 ny fanapahankevitry ny NBA.""  This directly indicates that the NBA's concern stemmed from a player testing positive. Option A is the most accurate and general statement reflecting this.
"
Iza no nahatafiditra ny baolina nahatonga ny Washington Capitals hibata ny fandresena tamin’ilay lalao nihaonana tamin’ny Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Ny fanampian'i Ovechkin voalohany tamin'io alina io dia nandritra ny baolina tafiditry ny mpilalao vaovao Nicklas Backstrom ka nibatàna fandresena"". This translates to ""Ovechkin's first assist that night was during a goal by the new player Nicklas Backstrom that sealed the win.""

"Iza no nahatafiditra ny baolina faha-60 tamin’ny taompilalaovana, nandritra ny lalao nihaonan’ny Capitals sy ny Thrashers?","The correct answer is **D: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Ny fanampian'i Ovechkin voalohany tamin'io alina io dia nandritra ny baolina tafiditry ny mpilalao vaovao **Nicklas Backstrom** ka nibatàna fandresena"". This means Nicklas Backstrom assisted on the goal that gave Ovechkin his 60th goal.

Tamin’ny oviana ny banky Northern Rock no nila ny tohana avy amin’ny governemanta?,"The correct answer is **D: Nandritra ny krizy findramam-bola misy antoka**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nila tohana i Northern Rock noho izy niahaka nandritra ny krizy findramam-bola misy antoka mety hampidi-doza tamin’ny taona 2007."" (Northern Rock needed help because it was struggling during the financial crisis in 2007.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Taorian’ny nahazoan’ilay banky ny zom-pirenena:** The text says the bank *received* nationalisation *after* needing help, not that it needed help *after* getting nationalised.
* **B: Rehefa nosarahina tamin’ilay orinasa mpitantana fananana ilay banky:**  The text states it was nationalized *before* being split into ""good"" and ""bad"" banks.
* **C: Taorian’ny nividianan’ny Vondrona Virgin an’ilay banky:** While Virgin did have an interest in the bank, the need for government assistance predates the purchase by Virgin.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra marina ny fifandraisan’ny Vondrona Virgin amin’ny banky Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **D: Taorian’ny nahazoan’ilay banky zom-pirenena no nataon’ny Vondrona Virgin ny tolo-bidiny voalohany ho an’ilay banky.**

Here's why:

* The text states that the Virgin Group offered a bid for the bank *before* it was taken into national ownership. 
* It also says the Virgin Group bought the ""good bank"" (the retail banking part) *after* the bank was nationalized in 2010.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Novidian’ny Vondrona Virgin ihany koa ny orinasa mpitantana fananana an’i Northern Rock:** The text explicitly says the Virgin Group *didn't* buy the asset management part, only the retail banking part.
* **B: Nividy an’ilay banky taorian’ny nahazoany zom-pirenena ny Vondrona Virgin:** The text states the bid was *before* nationalization.
* **C: Nanolotra tohana vonjy maika ho an’ilay banky ny Vondrona Virgin nandritra ny krizy findramam-bola misy antoka:** The text says the *national government* provided emergency aid, not the Virgin Group.

"Araka ny voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, firenena iza no iantraikan’ilay fanaovana sonia ny fifanarahana momba ny toetrandro tany Kyoto?","The correct answer is **A: Etazonia**.

The passage explicitly states that RAmose Rudd's decision to honor the Kyoto Protocol ""upset the United States, which is the only remaining developed nation not to have ratified it.""
"
Noeritreretin’ny governementa ostraliana teo aloha hitondra fahavoazana amin’ny inona ny fanaovan-tsonia tao Kyoto?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny toe-karenan’ilay firenena**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Australian government argued against honoring the Kyoto Protocol because it would **harm their economy** due to their reliance on coal exports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Etazonia:** The passage says the US was impacted, but the Australians were concerned about their *own* economy.
*   **C: Ny fanondranana saribao:** While coal exports are mentioned, the core issue is the impact on the *economy* due to those exports.
*   **D: Ny tanjona fampielezana akora eny amin’ny rivotra an’ilay firenena:** This is a reason *why* other countries *don't* have targets, not why Australia didn't want to honor Kyoto.

Therefore, the Australian government believed honoring the Kyoto Protocol would negatively impact their economy."
Nampidirina niasa tamin’ny fandaharanasa inona ireo mpitifitra tamin’ilay andrana?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny fandaharanasa fihazanan’ny Sporting Shooters Association**.

The text states: ""...nisy ny mpilatsaka an-tsitrapo mahay nampidirina niasa, ao anatin’ny fandaharanasa fihazanan’ny Sporting Shooters Association."" ( ""...skilled volunteers were recruited, including within the Sporting Shooters Association's shooting program."")
"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana ireto no tsy maneho marina ilay andrana fiadiana amin’ny bibikely?,"The correct answer is **A: Tsy notombanana ilay izy, satria izy io no andrana voalohany tamin’ilay fandaharanasa**.

Here's why: The passage explicitly states that the attempt was **not** predicted or anticipated; it was a follow-up attempt and the success was being monitored. Option A contradicts this direct statement.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

*   **B: Ireo mpitifitra dia nahazo torolalana momba ny fizàrana:** The passage states this directly.
*   **C: Ireo mpitifitra dia narahin’ny mpiambina ny valan-javaboary maso:** The passage states this directly.
*   **D: Mpitifitra efatra no voafidy:** The passage states this directly.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, taiza no nahitana ilay fivakisana?","The correct answer is **A: Tany amin’ny Rift Valley**.

The text states: ""midika izany fa mila averina amin’ny toerany ny zavatra rehetra”, hoy ny mpikaroka ao amin’ny **Sampam-pikarohan’i Rift Valley ao Etiopia**..."" which translates to ""...which means everything needs to be put back in its place,” says the researcher at the **Rift Valley Research Center in Ethiopia**...

While the other options are related to the information, the most direct answer to ""taiza no nahitana ilay fivakisana?"" (where was the fossil found?) is the Rift Valley.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no nitranga taloha kokoa noho ny nandrasana?","The correct answer is **B: Ilay fivakisana**.

The passage states: ""Raha jerena amin’ity fosily ity, ny fivakisana dia efa ela kokoa noho ny napetraka tamin’ny porofo avy amin’ny molecular."" This translates to: ""Looking at this fossil, the fission [referring to geological events/processes] is older than what is indicated by the molecular evidence.""  Therefore, the fission happened earlier.

Inona no mila hataon’ny mpilalao iray raha te hifehy ny fikisakisahana mandritra ny lalao video iray izy?,"The correct answer is **D: Mamindramindra an’ilay fitaovana amin’ny rivotra.**

The text explicitly states that players control the action and movement in video games by **moving the device in the air**. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Manao azo antoka hoe ny fitaovam-pandrefesana taratra an’ilay mpanara-maso dia mipetraka akaikin’ilay filalaovana:** While the sensor bars need to be near the TV, this doesn't describe how the *player* interacts with the game.
* **B: Mikajy ny fiorenany any amin’ny toerana misy refy telo:**  The sensor bars create a 3D space, but this is a characteristic of the system, not the player's action.
* **C: Mametraka fitaovam-pandrefesana taratra eo akaikin’ny fahitalavitr’izy ireo:** This is similar to A and doesn't describe the player's interaction.



"
Inona no noforonina mba hitovy amin’ny fibaikolavitry ny fahitalavitra?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny mpanara-maso Nintendo Revolution**.

The question asks what was created to be *like* the TV remote. The passage states that the Nintendo Revolution controller (the ""mpanara-maso Nintendo Revolution"") uses two motion sensors to mimic a TV remote's functionality.
"
Inona no tsy voalaza tao amin’ny tatitra farany nataon’ny masoivohom-baovao Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Nahazo fampitahorana amin’alalan’ny baomba ilay fiaramanidina**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what was *not* mentioned in the *latest* report.
* The prompt states the *latest* report mentioned the plane received bomb interception and returned to Afghanistan.
* Option A specifically mentions ""nahazo fampitahorana amin’alalan’ny baomba"" (received bomb interception), which is a key piece of information from the latest report and therefore *was* mentioned. 
* Options B, C, and D are all mentioned in the prompt.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
Inona no tsy voalaza tao amin’ny tatitra voalohany nataon’ny masoivohom-baovao Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **D: Nahazo fampitahorana amin’alalan’ny baomba ilay fiaramanidina**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what was *not* mentioned in the *first* report.
* The passage states the *latest* report mentioned the plane received a bomb attack.
* The passage states the *first* reports mentioned the plane was not allowed to stay in Ürümqi.

Therefore, the fact that the plane received a bomb attack was mentioned in the *latest* report, but not necessarily in the *first*. The statement that the plane was not allowed to stay in Ürümqi *was* mentioned in the first report, according to the passage.

So, the best answer is D.
"
Inona no nambaran’i Sara Danius nandritra an’ilay fandaharana tao amin’ny onjampeo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny komity dia hanatsahatra ny ezaka ataony mba hiresahana amin’i Bob Dylan.**

The text states: ""Hoy Danius, ”Tsy manao na inona na inona izahay amin’izao. Niantso sy nandefa mailaka tamin’ny mpiaramiasa akaiky aminy aho ary nahazo valiny feno fitiavana be. Hatreto, ampy angamba izay.“"" This indicates the committee has stopped trying to communicate with Bob Dylan.
"
Iza no tsy nety azo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ny Akademia Soediana**.

Here's why:

The text states that Sara Danius said the Nobel Committee (which is part of the Swedish Academy) had stopped trying to communicate with Bob Dylan.  The question asks who *wasn't* able to be contacted. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mpiaramiasa akaiky amin’i Bob Dylan (Close associates of Bob Dylan):** Sara Danius *did* contact them. The text explicitly says she called and emailed them.
*   **B: Sara Danius:** Sara Danius *was* able to communicate and speak to the media about the situation.
*   **D: Bob Dylan:** Bob Dylan was the one who was not directly contacted by the Nobel Committee.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Ny Akademia Soediana**."
Iza no nilaza fa ilay fianianana dia “dingana mavesa-danja”?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The question states that ""Ny mpitondra tenin’i Bush, Gordon Johndroe, dia namaritra ny fianianan'i Korea Avaratra ho “dingana mavesa-danja”"". This translates to ""Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndroe, described North Korea's pledge as a 'significant step'"".
"
Hajia firy no novokarin’i Stania ho an’ny firenena isan-karazany?,"The correct answer is **A: Mihoatry ny 2.000**.

The text states: ""Namokatra hajia mihoatry ny 1000 ho an’i Soeda sy 28 ho an’ny firenena hafa izy."" 1000 + 28 = 1028, which is approximately 2000.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no antony heverina fa mahatonga an’ireo lavaky ny sinibe hitete tsy an-kiato?","The correct answer is **C: Fiitarana vokatry ny hafanana**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tamin'ny alarobia tolakandro, mbola nitete ireo lavaky ny sinibe angamba noho ny fiitarana vokatry ny hafanana tao anatin'ilay sinibe.""  This directly links the buckling of the pipe to the expansion caused by heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fenoina ilay faritra fanibohana fanampiny:** While there's a larger storage area, the text doesn't connect its fullness to the buckling of the pipe.
* **B: Andrana mahazatra fatao amin’ny rafitra fifehezana ny afo:**  The routine fire system test *caused* the oil spill, but the text attributes the pipe buckling to the *heat* expansion afterward.
* **D: Firehetana tao amin’ny tobin’ny paompy iray an’i Fort Greely:**  The oil spill originated from the pipeline, not the pump. The text doesn't mention any explosion at the pump.



"
Nahoana ireo vavafantsona mpandrindra tsindry no nisokatra?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny fahatapahan’ny herinaratra taorian’ny andrana fatao amin’ny rafitra fifehezana iray.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Niteraka ny fisokafan’ny vavafantsona mpandrindra tsindry ny fahatapahan’ny herinaratra taorian’ny andrana mahazatra fatao amin’ny rafitra fifehezana ny afo ary nipololotra ny solika tsy voadio teo akaikin’ny tobin’ny paompy 9 an’i Fort Greely.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nisy fiitarana vokatry ny hafanana tao anatin’ilay sinibe:** While there *was* heat expansion, this was a *result* of the valves opening, not the *cause* of them opening.
* **C: Feno ireo sinibe:** The passage mentions additional storage areas that weren't full, so this wasn't the reason the valves opened.
* **D: Tsy afaka nandray barila ampy ny faritra fanibohana fanampiny:** This is a consequence of the situation, but not the reason the valves opened in the first place.



"
"Amin’izao fotoana izao, hoatran’ny ahoana ny haavon’ny rano ao amin’Ny Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Hatreo am-balahana**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Ninth Ward is ""feno rano hatreo am-balahany"" (full of water up to its walls) due to the levee failures.  ""Am-balahana"" means ""up to the walls"" or ""to the height of the walls.""
* Option A (20 feet) refers to the height of the storm surge.
* Option B (6 inches) refers to the diameter of the pipe.
* Option D (100 feet) refers to the area the water is spreading to.

Therefore, ""hatreo am-balahana"" is the most accurate description of the water level in the Ninth Ward at the time.
"
"Nandritra ny rivodoza Katrina, inona no nitranga tao amin’Ny Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **A: Nameno faritra 100 feet ny tondradrano.**

The passage states: ""The Ninth Ward, which saw floodwaters as high as 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, is now flooded to the ceiling because nearby levees broke. Water is spilling over the levees, flooding an area 100 feet.""

While options B and C are true statements from the passage, option A summarizes the overall situation in the Ninth Ward *during* Hurricane Katrina, which is what the question asks. Option D is about a potential consequence of the levee failure, not what *happened* in the Ninth Ward during the storm.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy nohamafisin’i Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny toe-pahasalaman’ilay marary amin’izao (The patient's condition at the time)**.

Here's why:

* **The question states Hamilton *did* confirm that no negligence occurred in the patient's treatment.**
* **Option A (Taiza ilay marary no nandeha - Where the patient went) is a detail about the patient's travel history, which is relevant to the context of potential exposure to Ebola.** This is likely something Hamilton would have addressed.
* **Option B (Ny mety hahazoan’ilay marary an’ilay tsimokaretina - The patient's potential exposure to the virus) is crucial to understanding the situation.** Hamilton would have needed to consider and likely confirmed how the patient could have contracted the virus.
* **Option C (Raha toa ka narahina ny lamina araka ny tokony ho izy - If the protocol was followed correctly) is directly related to the investigation of negligence, and Hamilton specifically stated that no negligence occurred.**

**Option D (Ny toe-pahasalaman’ilay marary amin’izao - The patient's condition at the time)** is the only option that Hamilton *did not* specifically confirm or address in the provided text. He focused on the treatment protocol and the lack of negligence, not necessarily on the specifics of the patient's health status when admitted.



"
Inona no zavatra tian’ny manampahaizana ara-tsiansa ho azo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny fomba niforonan’ny Tany**.

The passage states: ""Manantena hahazo ny fomba fiforonan’ny planeta ny manampahaizana ara-tsiansa, indrindra indrindra ny fomba niforonan’ny Tany..."" which directly translates to ""Scientists hope to learn about how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed...""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, anjara asa inona no nosahanin’ny polisy teo an-toerana tamin’ilay fanakatonana?","The correct answer is **C: Nanoro ny mpitondra fiara lalana hafa izy ireo**.

The text states: ""mpitandro filaminana 80 no nanampy teny an-toerana ka nanoro ny mpitondra fiara ny fiolahana."" This translates to ""80 security officers were deployed to the scene and directed the traffic by the driver of the vehicle.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Niteny tamin’ny FBI izy ireo mba hanatsahatra ny asa:** While the MTA stopped work at the FBI's request, the police's direct action at the scene was directing traffic.
* **B: Nanapa-kevitra ny hanao an’ilay fanatsaharana asa izy ireo:** The decision to halt work was made by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MTA), not the police at the scene.
* **D: Nitatitra fahatarana noho ny fifamoivoizina tamin’ilay lalana hafa izy ireo:** The text mentions traffic flow *around* the main road, but it doesn't say the police reported congestion on the other road. Their primary action was directing traffic.



"
Inona no nitranga tamin’ireo fidiran’ny fantsona nandritra an’ilay fanatsaharana asa?,"The correct answer is **A: Nosakanana izy ireo (They were blocked/sealed)**.

The text states: ""Fiara be fanariam-pako no nampiasaina hanakanana ny fidiran’ny fantsona"" which translates to ""Many armored vehicles were used to block the entrance of the tunnel."" 

Therefore, the tunnels were blocked.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy nitranga talohan’ny nandonan’ilay fiara an’ilay mpaka sary?","The correct answer is **A: Nomen’ny polisin’ny lalambe baiko ilay mpakasary mba hiverina teny ampita tamin’ilay lalana.**

The text states: ""ny sefon’ny polisin’ny lalamben’ny Kalifornia izay manao ny fisavana ny anome baiko azy hiverina, indroa."" This translates to ""the head of the California Highway Patrol who is conducting the investigation of his driving record, twice.""  This happened *before* the car was pulled over.
"
Inona no nandraman’ilay mpakasary hatao talohan’ny nandoman’ilay fiara azy?,"The correct answer is **B: Haka sary ny fanakanan’ny polisy iray**.

The text states: ""ny mpaka sary dia nanajanona ny fiarany tery ampitan’ny Kianjan’ny Sepulveda ary nanandrana ny haka sary ny fanakanan’ny polisy alohan’ny hiapitiny sy ny hanoizany ihany..."" (the photographer stopped his car at the Sepulveda Basin and tried to take pictures of the police blocking the way before he was stopped and arrested...).
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy heverina ho torohevitra mitombina hitendrena angorodao am-pahombiazana?","The correct answer is **A: Hampiakarana ny feony, ampitomboy ny hery amin’ny fanindrinao ny bokotra**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tadidio fa tsy ilaina ny manindry ny bokotra mafy mba hahazoana feo mafy toy ny amin’ny piano."" (Remember that it's not necessary to press the keys hard to get a loud sound like a piano.) and ""Ahazoana feo mafy tsara, dia tsindrina mafimafy ary haingana kokoa ny lakolosy."" (For a good loud sound, press the key firmly and quickly.)

Option A directly contradicts this by suggesting increasing the volume and pressing harder.  The other options align with the advice given in the text.
"
"Rehefa mitendry angorodao, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no hanamapy amin’ny fampiakarana ny feo?","The correct answer is **B: Tanjaka kokoa** (Stronger).

The passage states: ""Mianatra mitendry angorodao, ahazoana feo mafy tsara, dia tsindrina mafimafy ary haingana kokoa ny lakolosy.""  This translates to: ""When learning to play the organ, to get a good loud sound, press the keys hard and quickly."" 

Therefore, a stronger pressure on the keys results in a louder sound.
"
Nahoana ny sary amin’ny fahitalavitra no tapaka ny sisiny?,"The correct answer is **B: Mba hamenoana ny efijery iray manontolo amin’ny sary**.

Here's why:

* **Overscan** is the intentional cropping of the edges of a video image to fit a specific aspect ratio of a television screen.  This is done to avoid black bars and ensure the image fills the entire screen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mba ahafahana manao ny dika an-tsoratra:** While cropping *might* be part of the editing process, it's not the *reason* for overscan on television.
* **C: Mba ahafahana manatontosa fanovana tsotra amin’ny formats hafa:** Overscan isn't done for easy format conversion.
* **D: Mba hanapahana ny dika an-tsoratra manakaiky loatra ny faritra ambany:**  Overscan doesn't specifically target the bottom; it crops the edges.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto olana manaraka ireto no mety hiseho rehefa mamadika sarimihetsika ho format DVD?","The correct answer is **D: Ireo sisiny tapaka (The edges are cut off)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""rehefa manamboatra DVD ianao dia tsy maintsy ho voatapaka koa ny sisiny"" (when you burn a DVD, the edges will also be cut off).  This is directly related to the issue of overscan.  Because DVD formats don't typically handle overscan, the edges of the image are cropped to fit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ny sary tsy mahafeno ny efijery iray manontolo (The picture doesn't fill the entire screen):** This is the opposite of what happens.
*   **B: Dika an-tsoratra tapaka amin’ny ampahany (Text is cut off in part):** While text *can* be affected by overscan, the passage focuses on the edges of the image.
*   **C: Ny sary mameno ny efijery iray manontolo (The picture fills the entire screen):** This is not what happens when converting to DVD format.



"
Aiza avy no misy toby miaramila Britanika?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The text states: ""Jeneraly Jaona Kadioalidera dia nandefa fanafihana fanodinana manohitra ny Brotanika garisaona tany **Bordentown**..."" This indicates that the British garrison is located in Bordentown.
"
Sonian’iza no miseho eo amin’ny taratasy nosoratan-tanana?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The text states: ""avy eo nalefa tao amin’ny fanaovana pirinty Jaona Donlapy izay tsy lavitra teo."" (then sent to the printer John Dunlap who was nearby.)  This indicates that John Dunlap was the printer who produced the broadsides. While the others were involved in the creation of the text, Dunlap was the one who printed it.
"
"Amin’ireto toerana manaraka ireto, taiza no nisy fanafihana tao Dunlap farany?","The correct answer is **C: Londres**.

The text states: ""Nisy dika tonga tao Londres tamin’ny 10 Aogositra."" This translates to ""Some copies arrived in London on August 10th."" Therefore, the last location mentioned where Dunlap prints were present is London."
Taiza no nisy ny tafik’i Kolonely Stark?,"The correct answer is **C: Manamorona ny avaratra atsinanan’ny saikinosy**.

The passage states: ""Hefa nanitatra haingana ny fefy tamin’ny rindrim-bato fohy izy ireo, nanomboka teo andrefana hatrany amin’ny moron-drano eo amin’ny sisindranomasina kely. Nametraka tsangan-kazo 100 feet (30 m) teo alohan’ny fefy i Gridley na i Stark ary nandidy fa tsy tokony hisy hitifitra raha tsy efa nandalo teo alohan’ilay hazo daholo ny olona efa mpandalo eo.""

This describes the troops building a line north-east of the salt-water bay. Therefore, option C is the accurate answer.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, oviana ireo lehilahin’i Stark no nanitatra ny fefin’izy ireo?","The correct answer is **C: Nandritra ny fisintonan’ny ranomasina**.

The text states: ""Rehefa nanisy elanelana manaraka ny renirano Mystic manaraka ny avaratra atsinanan’ny sarinosy ny ranomasina avo, dia nanitatra haingana ny fefy tamin’ny rindrim-bato fohy izy ireo..."" which translates to: ""After a distance following the Mystic River to the northeast of the harbor's headland, they quickly extended the fence along a short stone wall..."" This happened *while* establishing a position near the harbor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rehefa niatso miaramila fanampiny ny mpanjanaka:** Calling for reinforcements happened *before* they started extending the fence.
* **B: Rehefa avy nandalo ny zohy ny mpandalo mahazatra:** The fence was extended *before* anyone passed through the zhou (headland).  The zhou was the point they were setting up *near*.
* **D: Rehefa naka toerana mialoha ny tafika:**  While they *were* establishing a forward position, the text specifies they extended the fence *during* the process of positioning themselves near the harbor.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no iray tamin'ireo vanim-potoana nisy herisetra indrindra tao Sina?","The correct answer is **D: Tamin’ny vanim-potoanan'ny Fanjakana Telo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ny vanimpotoan’ny Fanjakana Telo no Fanta-daza indrindra amin’ireny vanim-potoana ireny, izay naharitra 60 taona teo anelanelan’ny Han sy ny dinastia Jin. Nandritra izany fotoana izany, nisy ady mahery vaika teo amin’ny samy andriana maro izay niady ny seza fiandrianana. Ireo Fanjakana Telo dia iray tamin’ireo vanimpotoana nisiana rà nandriaka be indrindra teo amin’ny tantaran’i Sina fahagola.""

This translates to: ""The Three Kingdoms period is the most famous among these periods, which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasty. During this time, there was a power struggle between many princes who fought for the throne. The Three Kingdoms period is one of the periods that had the most bloodshed in the history of ancient China.""



The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tamin’ny Tarana-mpanjaka avy amin’i Jin** - The text mentions the Jin dynasty as a period *between* the Han and Three Kingdoms, not as the most violent period.
*   **B: Tamin’ny vanim-potoanan’i Xi’an** - Xi'an was a capital city, not a period.
*   **C: Tamin’ny Tarana-mpanjaka avy amin’i Han** - The text does not describe the Han dynasty as the most violent period."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no marina momba ny fokom-bitsika miaramila iray miditra amin'ny dingana fifindrafindram-ponenana?","The correct answer is **A: Manorim-ponenana izy ireo mandritra ny alina.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Eo amin’ny dingana fifindra-monina, ny vitsika miaramila dia mandeha amin’ny alina ary mijanona mba hitoby mandritry ny andro."" (During the migration stage, the military ants travel at night and stop to forage during the day.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kely ny tahirin-tsakafony:** While it's true they start migrating when food is scarce, the passage doesn't explicitly state their food supply is *small*. It just says it's dwindling.
*   **C: Manorim-ponenana izay niova tao anatin’ny 17 andro izy ireo:** The passage says the *antenam-potoana* of the migration is 17 days, not that their bodies change during that time.
*   **D: Mirenireny izy ireo mandritra ny tontolo andro:**  The passage directly states they forage (and therefore are not continuously moving) during the day.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no fanambarana ahitana taratra marina ny fahazarana manorim-ponenana ataon’ny fokom-bitsika miaramila mandritra ny dingana fifindrafindram-ponenana?","The correct answer is **C: Miova fonenana isan'andro izy ireo**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ny vitsika miaramila dia mandeha amin’ny alina ary mijanona mba hitoby mandritry ny andro. Manomboka mifindra monina ny andiam-bitsika rehefa mihena ny sakafo azo hanina. Mandritra izany fifindra-monina izany dia manamboatra akany maromaro vonjy maika izy ireo izay miova isan’andro."" (The military ants travel at night and stop to feed during the day. The ant colony begins to migrate when food is scarce. During this migration, they create multiple temporary shelters that change daily.)

This clearly indicates that they don't use a single, fixed shelter. They create *multiple* temporary shelters that *change daily*. Therefore, option C is the most accurate description of their nesting habit during the migration phase.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Manangana fonenana izy ireo mandritra ny alina** (They build a nest at night): The text mentions they stop to feed *during the day* and travel at *night*. It doesn't say they build nests at night.
* **B: Mirenireny izy ireo mandritra ny 17 andro tsy manorim-ponenana** (They wander for 17 days without nesting): The text explicitly says they *create multiple temporary shelters* during the 17-day migration period.
* **D: Fonenana iray ihany no ampiasain'izy ireo mandritra ny faharetan'ny dingana** (They use only one nest during the duration of the phase): This is directly contradicted by the text, which states they create *multiple* temporary shelters.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no hitohy na dia misy aza ny famantarana ivelany?,"The correct answer is **C: Famantaranandro biolojika (Biological clocks)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""The biological clock is an internal, self-sustained mechanism that continues its cycle even in the absence of external cues.""  This means it continues even if there are no external signals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ny tsingerina mipoitra avy ao anaty (Internal cycle)** While the passage mentions internal cycles, it does not specify that they necessarily continue without external cues.
*   **B: Ny gadona manara-potoana (Chronometer)** A chronometer is a device used to measure time. The passage refers to a biological clock.
*   **D: Gadona voadinika (Controlled chronometer)** This doesn't fit the description of a biological clock. The biological clock is self-sustaining.

Therefore, only the biological clock is described as continuing its cycle even in the absence of external cues."
Voambolana inona no manoritsoritra an’ireo olona mampiseho fiovan'ny toetra phénotypique sasany?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphe**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphe** refers to individuals exhibiting distinct phenotypes (observable characteristics) due to variations in their genetic makeup. The definition provided states that if an individual expresses their unique traits, they are considered polymorphic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphe:**  Describes individuals who express only one specific phenotype.
* **Zavamananaina & Karazana:**  These are broad terms for organisms and species, not specific descriptions of individual variation.
* **Zavamananaina:** While all individuals are animals (zavamananaina), this isn't the term describing the variation in phenotypes.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no teny mety hamaritana ireo zavamananaina mameno faritra iray?,"The correct answer is **C: Karazana (Species)**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Ny ny atao hoe mponina dia fitambaran'ny zavamananaina ana karazana iray anatina toerana iray voafaritra"" - This translates to ""A population is a group of animals of the same species in a defined area.""

Therefore, the word that best describes animals filling a defined area is **karazana (species)**.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphe (Monomorphic):** Refers to individuals showing only one specific phenotype.
* **Vahoaka (Population):** While related, the question is asking for the *type* of organism filling the area, not the group itself.
* **Polymorphe (Polymorphic):** Refers to individuals showing multiple different phenotypes.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy mety atao ohatra amin'ny hetsika fizahan-tany anaty natiora?,"The correct answer is **C: Fitsidihana tranombakoka momba ny siansa (Visiting a science museum)**.

Here's why:

* **The question describes nature-based ecotourism.** This type of tourism focuses on experiencing and appreciating natural environments.
* **Options A, B, and D (hiking, photographing wildlife, and birdwatching) all directly involve experiencing the natural world.**
* **Option C (visiting a science museum) is focused on a man-made environment and educational exhibits, not a natural environment.** While a science museum *could* have exhibits on nature, the act of *visiting* a museum itself doesn't fit the definition of nature-based ecotourism.

Therefore, visiting a science museum is the option that doesn't align with the described type of ecotourism.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no fototra iorenan’ny rafi-pitaterana?","The correct answer is **B: Fiara manokana**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Anatin’ity fiara fitaterana mihetsiketsika ity dia mifandray, ary manohana, rafi-pitaterana mifototra amin’ny fiara manokana ihany ny rehetra."" (Inside this moving vehicle, everyone is connected and supported by a transportation system based *only on private cars*.)

The passage then connects this car-centric system to the release of carbon and the destabilization of the biosphere.  Therefore, the fundamental basis of the transportation system described is the use of private cars.  The other options are consequences or related factors, but not the fundamental basis."
Karazana fahana inona no hananan’ny potin-javatra miodina ny vihy?,"The correct answer is **D: Fahana miabo sy miiba**.

Here's why:

*   **Protons** have a positive electric charge (miabo).
*   **Neutrons** have no electric charge (tsy misy fahana).
*   **Electrons** have a negative electric charge (miiba).

Since the nucleus contains both protons (positive) and neutrons (neutral), the overall charge of the nucleus is a combination of both positive and negative charges. Therefore, the atom has both positive and negative charges."
Potin-javatra inona no hita ao anaty vihy?,"The correct answer is **D: Prôtôna, netirônina ary elektirôna** (Protons, neutrons, and electrons).

The passage explicitly states that the nucleus contains both protons and neutrons. It also mentions electrons orbiting the nucleus. Therefore, the nucleus contains all three subatomic particles.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no ohatra amin'ny isa roafototra dimy bit?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **Bits** are sequences of binary digits (0s and 1s).
* The question asks for an example of *five* bits.
* Option C, ""10010"", has exactly five binary digits.

Let's look at the other options:

* **A: 1010** - Only four bits.
* **B: 12001** - Contains the digit '2', which is not a binary digit (0 or 1).
* **D: 110101** - Contains six bits.



"
Ahoana ihany koa no ilazana ny isa binaire?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

The question states that all computers store information as binary code, which is made up of 0s and 1s. These 0s and 1s are called **bits**.
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy voalaza ao amin'ny sombin-dahatsoratra ho tombontsoa voalohany amin'ny fanoratan’ny mpianatra bilaogy?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny fampihenana ny fanakianana ny namana (Reducing peer criticism)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that because students are often the most active commenters, blog writers try to improve their posts to avoid being ""tsikera"" (criticized/teased). This implies that reducing peer criticism is a benefit of blogging.
* While the other options are benefits mentioned in the text, they are not presented as the *first* or most immediate benefit. 
    * **A:** The text mentions improving writing skills, but it's presented as a consequence of avoiding criticism, not necessarily the primary benefit.
    * **C:** The text mentions that blogging encourages students to learn more about their surroundings, but it's linked to the desire to share and connect, not as a core, first benefit.
    * **D:** The text mentions blogging as a source of inspiration and encouraging students to go beyond the curriculum, but it's about broadening knowledge, not necessarily a primary benefit related to the act of writing itself.



Therefore, the most directly stated benefit of blogging in the text, concerning the act of writing and avoiding negative interactions, is related to reducing peer criticism.
"
Iza amin'ireto lafin'ny fanoratana bilaogy manaraka ireto no lazaina fa manosika ny mpianatra hanatsara ny fahaizany manoratra?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny faniriana hisoroka fanakianana**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Koa satria ny mpianatra matetika no mpisehatra mitsikera indrindra, ny mpanoratra ny blog dia niezaka nanatsara ny lahatsoratra mba hialana amin’izany tsikera izany.""  This directly links the desire to avoid criticism to the motivation for improving writing skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Mamaly matetika ny lohahevitra amin'ny aterineto:** While responding to online topics is a benefit of blogging, it's not the *primary* reason the text says blogging motivates writing improvement. It's more about the self-correction aspect.
* **C: Mitana ny fahalianan’ny mpamaky azy ireo:**  Attracting readers is a motivator for communication, but the text emphasizes the improvement of *writing skills* as a result of that motivation.
* **D: Ny filana fifarimbonana:**  Communication is mentioned, but the text focuses on how blogging helps students develop critical thinking and refine their ideas, which are linked to improved writing.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto ho an'ny mpianatra no tsy tombontsoa azo amin'ny fifandraisana tsy mifanaraka ara-potoana? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ny fanaraha-maso ny hafainganana (Monitoring the pace)**.

Here's why:

The text states that asynchronous communication *allows students to learn at their own pace and control the speed of learning*. Option D, ""Ny fanaraha-maso ny hafainganana"" (Monitoring the pace), is the opposite of what asynchronous communication facilitates.  Asynchronous learning *removes* the pressure to keep up with a fixed pace dictated by a classroom setting.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits of asynchronous communication, according to the text:

*   **A: Ny fampiasana ny aterineto ho loharanom-pitaovana (Using the internet as a tool):**  The text mentions the use of the internet and the World Wide Web.
*   **B: Ny fanatrehana mpampianatra mivantana amin'ny fotoana rehetra (Being able to meet the teacher directly at any time):** While the text doesn't explicitly state this as a benefit, it does say students can send questions to the teacher at any time, suggesting a level of direct communication.
*   **C: Ny ora fiasana malalaka (Flexible work hours):** The text directly mentions flexible work hours as a benefit.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto lafiny manaraka amin'ny serasera tsy mitovy tantana ireto no tsy azo alefitra ho an'ny mpianatra?","The correct answer is **C: Fitaovana fampianarana (Learning materials)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions several advantages of online learning that are *not* applicable to learning materials.** The text focuses on:
    * **Flexibility:**  ""Ny ora iasana malalaka sy afaka miova"" (Flexible working hours)
    * **Pace:** ""Mamela ireo mpianatra hianatra amin’ny gadony manokana ary mifehy ny hafainganan’ny fahalalana ara-panabeazana"" (Allows students to learn at their own pace and control the speed of learning)
    * **Accessibility:** ""Mamela ny mpianatra hanana fidirana amin’ny fampahalalana amin’ny fotoana rehetra"" (Allows students to have access to information at all times)
    * **Communication:**  ""Afaka mandefa fanontaniana amin’ny mpampianatra ihany koa ny mpianatra amin’ny fotoana rehetra ary afaka manantena valiny haingana"" (Students can also send questions to the teacher at any time and expect a quick reply).
    * **Reduced Constraints:** ""vitsy ny famerana fotoana"" (fewer time constraints).

* **Learning materials (fitaovana fampianarana)** are simply the content used for learning. The text doesn't address *how* online learning affects the content *itself*. It focuses on the *access* and *delivery* of information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ora fiasana (Working hours):**  The text says working hours are flexible, a key benefit of online learning.
* **B: Ora fiasana (Working hours):** The text highlights the flexibility of working hours in online learning.
* **D: Fampiasana Internet (Internet usage):**  The text directly mentions the use of the internet (""Fampiasana Internet"") as a fundamental part of online learning and a source of accessible information.



"
Inona no tsy voalaza ao amin'ny sombin-dahatsoratra nefa azo ampifandraisina amin'ny rova nisy tamin'ny Vanim-potoana Antenantenany?,"The correct answer is **B: Joute**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the historical interest in Arthurian castles – their appearance, sounds, and construction. The question asks what is *not* mentioned but can be connected to these castles.

*   **Joute** (a medieval equestrian sport) was a common activity associated with castles, particularly those owned by nobility. Tournaments and jousts were held for entertainment and to demonstrate knightly skill.
*   **Hitsoka anaty lakaly** (to be imprisoned in a dungeon) and **Fombafombam-panajana** (courtly manners) are related to the lives of those *within* the castle, not the castle's construction or strategic purpose.
*   **Chevalier** (knight) is directly mentioned in the passage, discussing the knights of Arthurian legend.

Therefore, *Joute* is the best fit for an activity closely linked to castles that the passage doesn't explicitly mention.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy voatonona ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra ho fofona na feo mety ho azo fohazina avy amin'ny mandalapa rava?,"The correct answer is **C: Fanasana (Laughter)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions:

*   **Feo sy fofon'ady efa lasa ela (sounds and breaths of long-ago battles)**
*   **Maheno ny kitron-tsoavaly mikapokapoka (hearing the hooves of horses clattering)**
*   **Maheno ny fofon'ny tahotra (hearing the breath of fear)**

While laughter *could* be present in a historical setting, it's not mentioned in the text as a sound associated with the ruins. The other options (battle, fear, horse hooves) are all directly referenced.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tena mamaritra ny Mandalapa Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **B: Nilaina ny fiarovana farafahakeliny noho ny filaminan’ny firenena tamin'ny fotoana nanorenana.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""tany amin’ny taona 1480 tany, rehefa nanomboka nanorina azy ny Lord Hasting, dia azo lazaina ho nilamina ilay firenena ka tsy dia nila fiarovana firy afatsy tamin’ny andiana mpanafika kely madinidinika.""  This indicates that while the town was peaceful at the time of construction, some minimal defense was still considered necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I Lord Hastings no nangataka ny rindri-matevin'ny lapa:** The text mentions Lord Hastings *starting* the castle, but it doesn't say he specifically requested thick walls. In fact, the text highlights the walls as being thin and vulnerable.
* **C: Tsy nahazatra nandritra ny vanim-potoana ny fanorenana ny mandalapa:** The text doesn't imply that castle building was unusual at that time.
* **D: Izy io dia naorina mba hanoherana ny fanafihana lavareny sy voahomana:** The text specifically says the walls are thin and not really designed to withstand heavy attacks.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate representation of the Mandalapa Kirby Muxloe based on the provided text."
Iza amin'ireto endri-panorenana manaraka ireto no heverina ho tsy mahazatra ho an'ny Mandalapa Kirby Muxloe mandritra ny vanim-potoana voalaza ao amin'ny andalana?,"The correct answer is **D: Rindrina manify**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Kirby Muxloe Castle's walls and defenses were ""thin"" and wouldn't withstand a serious attack. This contradicts the idea of a strong fortress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Varavarankely goavana:** While not inherently defensive, large doors were common in castles of the period.
* **B: Fototra fanorenana mba hanoherana ny fanafihana:** The passage implies that the castle was *not* initially built for heavy defense in 1480, but building a strong foundation for defense is a common castle construction practice.
* **C: Fiarovana kely kokoa noho ny an’ny mandalapa ​​sasany:** The passage suggests that the castle had *minimal* defense, not necessarily less than some other castles. The key point is that it wasn't strong.



Therefore, the most unusual and contradictory feature described is the thin walls."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsara indrindra ho an'ny mpihazakazaka hiomanany amin'ny andiany manaraka?","The correct answer is **D: Mampiasa trano fanaovana fanatanjahantena mba hampiasana ny vatana ambony**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ny fanomanana tsara indrindra amin’ny taom-pilalaovana ny hazakazaka dia ny kotrana hazakazaka malalaka mandritra ny ririnina, miaraka amin’ny zimnastika mampiasa ny vatana ambony"".

This translates to: ""The best preparation for the climbing season is the hanging leg workout in winter, along with gymnastics using the upper body.""

Option D directly reflects this recommendation. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Manao fanazaran-tena amin'ny hazakazaka lavitra ezaka amin’ny fahavaratra:** The passage emphasizes winter training with hanging legs.
*   **B: Mifantoka amin'ny fanatsarana ny hafainganana mandritra ny fiofanana:** While speed is important for elite climbers, the passage stresses endurance and preparedness for potential hazards.
*   **C: Mandresy ny fotoana telo minitra:** The passage suggests endurance, not necessarily winning in a specific time frame.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no manan-danja indrindra ho an'ny mpihazakazaka 800 metatra kilasy voalohany?","The correct answer is **C: Mametra fotoana ao anatin'ny roa minitra eo ho eo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ny lehilahy mpihazakazaka antsasaka mile sokajy voalohany, ny lehilahy mahavita izany anatin’ny roa minitra, dia mila manana hafainganam-pandeha be, fa ny faharetana dia tsy maintsy ambolena amin’ny mety ho loza rehetra.""  This translates to: ""The top-level sprint runners, the men who can do it in two minutes, need to have high speed, but endurance must be built to handle any potential hazards.""

Option C directly reflects this statement, highlighting the importance of achieving a time within two minutes. The passage emphasizes that achieving that time is a key characteristic of the top-level runners.

"Ho an’ny atileta iray, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ho vita amin'ny alalan'ny fanarahana fomba fisakafoanana irery ihany?","The correct answer is **C: Zava-bitan’ny sangany (Performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while a simple, healthy diet won't provide the same level of results as professional regimens, it *can* positively impact an athlete's overall health.  It also mentions strategies like energy management, hydration, and understanding nutrient timing will help improve performance and safety.

*   **A: Fanatsarana zava-bita (Performance Improvement):**  The passage explicitly links the described strategies (energy management, hydration, nutrient timing) to improving performance.
*   **B: Fampitomboina fankafizana (Increased Safety):**  The passage directly states that the strategies will help athletes improve safety.
*   **D: Fahasalamana ankapobeny (Overall Health):** The passage explicitly states a positive impact on overall health.
*   **C: Zava-bitan’ny sangany (Peak Performance/Results):** The passage contrasts a simple diet with the results professional athletes achieve. It says a simple diet ""is not capable of achieving the results of professionals."" Therefore, peak performance or significant results are *not* achievable solely through a simple diet.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy nolazaina fa fomba iray ho an’ireo atleta tanora hankafizana bebe kokoa ny fanatanjahantenan’izy ireo?","The correct answer is **A: Mihinana sakafo araka ny tokony ho izy**.

Here's why:

The text states that simply following a basic, healthy eating plan won't give young athletes the edge of professionals. However, it *does* mention the following things that help improve health and safety:

*   **Fiezahana handanjalanja ny heriny (Trying to conserve energy):** This relates to managing exertion.
*   **Fahazarana misotro rano (Habitual water intake):** This is explicitly mentioned.
*   **Fiezahana hahatakatra ireo lafiny maro amin’ny fomba fanomezana otrikaina fanampiny ny vatana (Trying to understand the many ways to provide additional nutrients to the body):** This refers to understanding nutrition.

While the text mentions overall health and nutrition, it **doesn't** suggest that simply ""eating healthily"" is enough to improve safety or performance. In fact, it implies it's insufficient on its own.

Option B, C, and D are all things mentioned in the text as ways to improve safety and performance. Therefore, only option A is not mentioned."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, nahoana no mety hividy fitaovana lafo vidy kokoa ny mpihazakazaka demi-fond?","The correct answer is **A: Araka ny safidin’izy ireo manokana (Based on their personal preference)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mety mahatsapa ireo atleta fa misy vokatra tian’izy ireo kokoa na dia tsy itondra vokatsoa marina aza izany."" (Athletes may feel like there are products they like more, even if they don't provide real benefits).

This directly indicates that athletes might choose more expensive equipment based on their *personal preference* rather than any demonstrable advantage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Voaporofo ny tombony (Proven benefits):** The passage explicitly says the products have little to no real benefit.
* **C: Hisy fiantraikany goavana amin'ny zava-bitan'izy ireo izany (They have a significant impact on their performance):**  Again, the passage states the products are largely ineffective.
* **D: Diso ny resaka mandeha mikasika ny fitaovana lafo vidy kokoa (The talk about more expensive equipment is wrong):** The passage implies the talk is *not* wrong; athletes are choosing the equipment.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no takin'ny hazakazaka demi-fond?","The correct answer is **C: Fitaovana vitsy kely**.

The passage states: ""Ny hazakazaka amin’ny halavirana antonony dia fanatanjahantena tsy dia lafo vidy; kanefa, maro ireo hevi-diso mahakasika ireo fitaovana vitsy ilaina raha handray anjara."" This translates to: ""Long-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions about the few items needed to participate."" This indicates that the sport doesn't require a lot of equipment.

Iza no nahita résonance magnétique nucléaire? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch sy Purcell**.

The text states: ""Ny IRM dia mifototra amin’ny tranga fizika antsoina hoe resonance magnétique niokleary (RMN), izay hitan’i Felix Bloch (niasa tao amin’ny Anjerimanontolon'i Stanford) sy i Edward Purcell (avy ao amin’ny Anjerimanontolo Harvard) voalohany tany amin’ny taona 1930 tany."" (MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was first discovered by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford Research Institute) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard's Institute of Technology) in the 1930s.)
"
Tamin'ny taona firy no nomena ny patanty voalohany ho an'ny Imagerie par résonance magnétique? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Nisy patanty navoaka efa-taona tatỳ aoriana, izay no patanty voalohany nomena tamin’ny resaka MRI."" This translates to ""A patent was granted years later, which was the first patent granted for MRI.""  While the first ""Indomitable"" scanner was completed in 1977, the patent was granted *before* that. The text doesn't explicitly state the year of the patent, but the wording implies it was before the 1977 completion. Looking at the timeline provided in the text, the patent was granted around 1974. Therefore, 1974 is the best fit based on the information given.

The other options are incorrect:
* 1977: This is when the first ""Indomitable"" scanner was completed, not the patent.
* 1930: This is when the principles of MRI were discovered, not when the patent was granted.
* 1970: This is when Raymond Damadian discovered the basis for using resonance for medical imaging, not when the patent was granted.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tokony ho takatry ny sain’olombelona tsara mba hahalalana ny dikan’ireo fihetsika ara-batan’ny hafa?","The correct answer is **D: Fiheverana (Belief)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to read minds (understanding what others are thinking, whether they intend to, believe, know, or not) is a valuable talent, especially for understanding the reasons behind people's actions.  Understanding someone's *beliefs* is key to accurately interpreting their behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Faniriana (Desire)**: While desire *can* influence behavior, the passage emphasizes understanding the underlying thoughts and motivations, not just desires.
*   **B: Fikasana (Intention)**: Intention is related to desire, and the passage aims at more fundamental thinking processes.
*   **C: Finoana (Faith/Belief)**: While close to the correct answer,  ""Fiheverana"" (Belief) encompasses a broader range of mental states than just faith, and is more fitting to understand the various motivations behind actions.



Therefore, **Fiheverana (Belief)** is the most accurate answer to the question of what a good mind should possess to understand the meaning of others' body language.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, manampy ny olombelona hanao inona ny fahatakarana ny fikasana?","The correct answer is **A: Manala ny tsy fisalasalana ao ambadiky ny fihetsika**.

Here's why:

The text states that understanding others' thoughts helps us understand the *reason* behind their actions. This directly relates to dispelling uncertainty (""tsy fisalasalana"") about their motivations.  

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Mahafantatra mialoha ny faniriana:** While understanding thoughts *can* help predict desires, the text focuses more on understanding the *reasons* for actions, not just predicting future wants.
* **C: Mandinika ny olombelona hafa nefa tsy mitsara:** The text doesn't emphasize non-judgmental observation. It highlights the ability to *interpret* thoughts.
* **D: Mamaky ny ao an-tsain'ny hafa:** While the text says that the talented people are able to read the minds of others, it's not the primary way that the understanding of others' thoughts can help us. The primary way is that we can understand the motivations behind their actions.

The passage explicitly states: ""Anatin’ny fikarohana momba ny Fahaizana Artifisialy ny fanamboarana milina hampandeha ho azy ny asa izay mitaky fihetsika mampiasa saina."" (In the research of Artificial Intelligence is the development of machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.)

While options B (detecting sound) and C (scheduling) are *examples* of what AI can do, they aren't the overarching goal. Option A (desire) is completely unrelated to the passage's content.  The core aim of AI, according to the text, is to automate tasks.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no matetika misy ifandraisany amin'ny AI?","The correct answer is **C: Science fiction**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na dia misy ifandraisany amin’ny science-fiction aza ny Fahaizana Artifisialy..."" which translates to ""Even though Artificial Intelligence has a connection to science fiction..."". This directly indicates that science fiction is related to AI.

While the other options are *applications* of AI (like customer service or facial recognition), the question asks about something *related* to AI, and the passage explicitly mentions science fiction as such.

* The text explicitly states: ""singa lehibe indrindra amin’io fomba fisainana io dia: iray ihany no valin-teny marina. Valiny roa ihany no eritreretinao, na marina na diso."" (The most important element of this mindset is: there is only one correct answer. You only consider two answers, either true or false.) This emphasizes the focus on finding the *correct* solution.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Mampihatra teknika vaovao amin'ny olana iray** (Applying new techniques to a problem): While the text mentions reusing existing techniques, it doesn't highlight innovation or applying *new* techniques.
* **C: Mandany ny fotoanany hamahana olana** (Spending time solving problems): The text focuses on *how* the problem is solved (logically, by considering two options), not just the time spent.
* **D: Mitadidy lamina** (Remembering patterns):  The text mentions the ability to ""mitadidy lasitra"" (remember past experiences/data), but the core skill isn't pattern recognition itself, but rather using that memory within a logical framework to arrive at the correct answer.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy heverina fa teboka ifantohan’ny fomba fisaina mitovy tanjona?","The correct answer is **B: Milona amin’ny fotoanany (Thinking quickly)**.

Here's why:

*   **The text emphasizes:** Logic, accuracy, identifying inconsistencies, recalling existing techniques, and gathering information. Crucially, it states ""one and only one answer is correct.""
*   **Option B (Thinking quickly)**, while potentially helpful, isn't a core element of the described problem-solving technique (Ireo Sarin-tsaina mifameno). The text doesn't highlight speed as a primary focus. The other options (A, C, and D) directly align with the described process.

Therefore, thinking quickly is the least emphasized aspect of the described cognitive style."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy azo heverina fa fanehoana an-tava bitika?","The correct answer is **A: Mijery lavitra sady miteny (Looking far and speaking)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on *subtle, fleeting facial expressions* that indicate emotions.  The other options (B, C, and D) – squinting, frowning, and grimacing – are all examples of small facial movements associated with specific emotions.

Looking far and speaking, while it *could* potentially be accompanied by subtle facial cues, is generally considered a more overt and less subtle action than the other options.  It doesn't fit the description of a ""fleeting, almost imperceptible"" expression that the passage emphasizes.



"
Iza amin'ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto momba ny famaritana ny dikan’ny fanehoana an-tava bitika ireto no tsy marina?,"The incorrect statement is **C: Ny resaka ary koa ireo fanehoana an-tava dia faritana ihany koa ny dikany (Speech and body language also define their meaning)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on micro-expressions – subtle facial movements. While speech and body language are important for communication, the passage specifically highlights how *micro-expressions* can reveal underlying emotions even when someone is trying to conceal them or can't speak.  It suggests micro-expressions can contradict spoken words, making the statement that they *define* meaning together incorrect. They provide *additional* clues, but aren't the sole definers.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Nitondra fandrosoana lehibe ny fandraketana rakitsary (Recording technology has led to great advancements)** - The passage explicitly states that recording technology allows for the study of micro-expressions.
* **B: Mety hamantarana ny lainga ny fandikana marina (It may reveal the truth of deception)** - The passage mentions Oliver Sacks' findings that individuals unable to speak can still accurately detect sincerity through micro-expressions.
* **D: Mety hanampy hamantarana ny fahatsoram-po izany (It may help to identify deceit)** -  This is directly supported by Sacks' observation and the general implication that micro-expressions can betray hidden emotions.



"
Iza amin'ireto no lasa zava-dehibe kokoa vokatry ny Renaissance? ,"The correct answer is **C: Fampahatsiahivana lahatsoratra (Retention of texts)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Renaissance changed the foundation of how people acquire knowledge. It mentions the shift from the pressure of individual memory to a more cumulative approach, emphasizing the ability to **retain and process written texts**.  This aligns directly with option C.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Fampahatsiahivana manokana (Individual memorization):** The passage states this *decreased* in importance.
* **B: Fahalalana miampitampita (Comprehensive knowledge):** While the Renaissance *did* promote more knowledge, the key change described is *how* knowledge was acquired and stored, not necessarily the breadth of knowledge itself.
* **D: Fahazoana vaovao (Acquisition of new information):** The passage says that the way information was *received* changed, but the core shift was in *how knowledge was retained and utilized* - particularly through written texts.



"
"Vokatry ny Renaissance, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy dia nasongadina loatra?","The correct answer is **A: Fampahatsiahivana manokana (Personal recollection)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Renaissance significantly changed how knowledge was acquired and stored.  It highlights the shift from relying on personal memory and direct observation (""tsindry tanatin'ny fitadidian'ny tsirairay"" - the pressure of individual observation) to a more organized system of storing information, primarily through written texts (""laharampahamehana kokoa ny fahaizana mitadidy lahatsoratra"" - knowledge of remembering articles/writings became more organized).

Therefore, personal recollection (fampahatsiahivana manokana) is presented as something that was *less* emphasized or less important during the Renaissance compared to the other options.  The other options (acquiring knowledge, remembering articles, and sharing new knowledge) are all aspects that *were* emphasized and changed by the Renaissance.
"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ahitana taratra zotom-po hampiasa aterineto hanohizana ny fiarahana?,"The correct answer is **C: Fikarohana fitsidihana (Browsing information)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights that social aspects like ""learning"" and ""community"" drive internet use. ""Self-expression"" and ""lasting relationships"" are also presented as motivating factors.

* **A: Fandraharahana ara-tambajotra (Networking):** This directly relates to building connections and relationships, a social motivator.
* **B: Fifandraisana tsy tapaka amin'ny fianakaviana (Constant connection with family):** This is a clear social benefit.
* **D: Fihaonana amin’ny olona vaovao (Meeting new people):**  This also falls under the category of social interaction.
* **C: Fikarohana fitsidihana (Browsing information):** While information is valuable, the passage *doesn't* frame simple information gathering as a primary social motivator for internet use. It's more about *how* people use the internet – to connect and share – than just seeking information.  Browsing can be solitary.

Therefore, browsing information is the option that doesn't directly tap into the social drivers of internet use as described in the passage.



"
Iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ahitana taratra ny zotom-po hampiasa aterineto hirotsahana an-tsehatra manokana?,"The correct answer is **A: Fikarohana fomba fandrahoana sakafo (Searching for ways to get food)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that online activity is driven by motivations like learning, social interaction, self-expression, and relationship building.  While finding food online *could* involve some social elements (e.g., finding a community of foodies), it primarily focuses on a basic need and practical task, rather than the deeper motivations highlighted in the text.

Options B, C, and D all fit within the described motivations:

*   **B: Famoahana fifanakalozan-kevitra ao amin'ny aterineto (Engaging in online discussions):** Directly related to social interaction and community building.
*   **C: Fikarohana vokatra hikarakarana ny fahasalamana (Searching for products to care for health):** Related to self-expression and personal well-being.
*   **D: Fitantanana vola (Managing money):** While practical, it can be related to self-improvement and financial well-being.

Therefore, finding ways to get food is the least aligned with the motivations for online engagement described in the passage.
"
Oviana i Eoropa Andrefana no nitsahatra tsy niantehitra betsaka tamin'ny fitaomana ary nanomboka nampivoatra ny fombany manokana?,"The correct answer is **A: Manodidina ny faraparan'ny Vanim-potoana Antenatenany**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""tany amin’ny faran’ny Vanimpotoana Antenantenany no nanombohan’I Eoropa tandrefana nampivoatra ny fomba fihaingony."" (In the late Byzantine era, Western Europe began to develop new ways of life.)
* **The passage also mentions:** ""...mety ho taraiky 25 ka hatramin’ny 30 taona ny fomba fitafy any andrefana."" ( ...the fashion in the west might be delayed by 25 to 30 years.) This implies a shift *after* the Byzantine period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nandritra ny vanim-potoana Byzantine:** The passage clearly indicates that Western Europe's development of new ways of life *began* in the late Byzantine era, not during the Byzantine era itself.
* **C: Tany ho any amin’ny 25 taona taorian'ny Vanim-potoana Antenatenany:**  While 25-30 years is mentioned as a delay in fashion, the passage says the development of *new ways of life* began in the late Byzantine period, not precisely 25 years after the fall.
* **D: Nandritra ny taonjato faha-11:** The passage indicates the late Byzantine era was when this began, meaning it was *after* the 11th century.



"
Vokatry ny inona ny fampiasana bokotra hanidina akanjo? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ny Krozada (The Crusades)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Iray amin’ireo fivoarana lehibe tamin’izany, izay vokatry ny kroazady, ny fanombohan’ny mponina nampiasa bokotra hanidiana akanjo."" (One of the major developments at that time, a result of the Crusades, was the start of people using buttons to fasten clothes.)

Therefore, the introduction of buttons was a consequence of the Crusades.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto manaraka ireto no heverina fa vahaolana lavitra ezaka azo atao ho an'ny olana ara-tontolo iainana?","The correct answer is **C: Famantarana ny anton'ny olana (Identifying the root cause of the problem)**.

Here's why:

* The text emphasizes that while temporary solutions (like reforestation) are helpful, the real solution lies in understanding and addressing the fundamental reasons *why* environmental problems exist. It states, ""...raha tsy te hahazo vahaolana vonjimaika isika, dia tokony mitady izay tena fototry ny olona, ary tokony hampijanona azy ireo isika."" (If we don't want temporary solutions, we should seek the real root of the problem and stop it.)

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Fanaovana ankivy ny safidy fomba fiaina hafahafa (Adopting a more sustainable lifestyle):** This is presented as a good *starting point* and a helpful action, but not the *long-term solution* according to the text.
* **B: Fikatrohana (Activism):**  While important, activism is a method of *addressing* the problem, not *solving* the underlying cause.
* **D: Fanarahana hetsika ara-tontolo iainana (Following environmental activities):**  This is a helpful *supportive action*, but doesn't address the core issue of understanding and stopping the root causes.

Inona amin’ireto fanambarana ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina ny toe-pahasalaman’ilay filoha taorian’izy voatily hoe voan’ilay tsimokaretina?,"The correct answer is **A: Tsy salama izy (He is not healthy)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states, ""Ankoatry ny fanaviana sy ny aretin-tenda dia salama tsara aho"" (Besides the flu and a cold, I am well).
* This directly contradicts option A, which states he is *not* healthy.
* Options B, C, and D are all supported by the text. He *was* affected by a cold and flu, his health is *not* a cause for concern, and he is recovering.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that is *not* accurately reflected in the provided text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ny filoha ireto no marina?","The correct answer is **C: Hahafahany miasa amin’ny alalan’ny fifandraisan-davitra ny fahasalamany.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ankoatry ny fanaviana sy ny aretin-tenda dia salama tsara aho ary afaka manao ny asako amin’ny alalan’ny fifandraisan-davitra."" (Besides the cold and flu, I am well and able to do my work through telecommunications.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsy manavy izy:** The text doesn't mention anything about him not being able to make decisions.
* **B: Hijanona ao an-trano mandritra ny herinandro maro izy:**  He is staying home for a few days (""andro maromaro""), not a long time (""herinandro maro"").
* **D: Tratry ny fiseho maherin’ilay tsimokaretina izy:** The text says he had a cold and flu (""fanaviana sy ny aretin-tenda"").

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, tamin’ny oviana ilay Rivodoza Tropikaly Gonu no nantenaina hihamalefaka?","The correct answer is **D: Talohan’ny nahatratrarany rivotra 149 miles isan’ora**.

The text states: ""Tamin'ny vao maraina androany, nanodidina ny 83 km/ora ny rivotra, ary nantenaina hihamalefaka izany."" This means the wind was at 83 km/h *today* and was expected to strengthen *from* the point where it reached 149 miles per hour (the strongest it had been).  Option D is the only one that reflects this.
"
Nahatratra ahoana ny fofo-drivotra tamin’ny Rivodoza Tropikaly Gonu nahery indrindra?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 kilaometatra isan’ora**.

The passage states: ""Tamin’izy nahery indrindra, ny Rivodoza Tropikaly Gonu… nahatratra fofo-drivotra maharitra hatramin’ny 240 kilaometatra isan’ora (149 miles isan’ora).""  This directly answers the question about the strongest wind speed.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy heverina ho toetoetran’ny Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **C: Manana sela maro izy io**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Karenia brevis no mahatonga ny samonta mena, zavamananan’aina anaty rano izay **tsy manana hafa tsy sela tokana**."" (Karenia brevis causes the red tide, an aquatic organism that has nothing but a single cell.)
* Options A, B, and D are all mentioned in the passage as consequences or actions related to Karenia brevis.

Therefore, the statement that Karenia brevis has multiple cells is directly contradicted by the text.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy afaka ataon’ny Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **B: Mitombo isa haingana amin’ny toe-javatra rehetra**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Karenia brevis thrives when nutrients are available.** It doesn't say it grows rapidly in *all* conditions.  It's specific to the presence of nutrients.

Let's look at why the other options *are* things Karenia brevis *can* do, according to the passage:

* **A: Mamono ny rafi-pitatitra ao amin’ny trondro:** The passage explicitly states that Karenia brevis produces toxins that can damage the nervous systems of fish.
* **C: Misy fiaintraikany amin’ny rano:** Karenia brevis is a marine organism, meaning it lives *in* water.  The passage mentions it causing red tides in water.
* **D: Mamokatra poizina:** The passage directly states that Karenia brevis ""Mamokatra poizina manimba ny rafi-pitatitra ny ahidrano.""



Therefore, option B is the only statement that isn't supported by the information in the passage."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy vokatry ny Tafiodrivotra Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: Tondradrano amin’ny lalana**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ny sisa tavela dia namokatra orana manerana ny ankamaroan’ireo nosy ny sisa tavela, na izany aza hatreto, tsy misy simba na tondradrano voatatitra.""  This means there were no tornadoes reported from Tropical Storm Felicia. The other options (heavy rainfall, thunder, and lightning) *were* mentioned as occurring.

The passage states that Hurricane Felicia *downgraded* to a tropical storm *before* becoming a Category 4 hurricane. Therefore, it wasn't initially classified as a tropical storm.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Ilay rotsak’orana vokatr’ilay izy dia nahasoa an’i Oahu:** The passage explicitly says the rainfall was ""heavy"" in Oahu.
*   **C: Nisy orana nanerana ny ankamaroan’ireo nosy:** The passage states ""The remnants left scattered rain across much of the islands.""
*   **D: Niarahana varatra ny rotsak’orana sasany:** The passage says ""Some of the rainfall was accompanied by gusty winds.""

So, the answer is **B**."
Iz amin’ireto fanambarana ireto no maneho marina ny vokatry ny Amboara Ben’i Hongria 2009?,"The correct answer is **C: Voaroaka i Piquet Jr. tao aorian’izy io (Piquet Jr. was fired after it).**

The text clearly states: ""Piquet Jr dia voaroaka tao aorian’ny Hungarian Grand Prix tamin’ny taona 2009."" (Piquet Jr. was fired after the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tratran’ny lozam-piarakodia i Fernando Alonso (Fernando Alonso was involved in an accident):** The text mentions Alonso's accident *during* the race, but it doesn't state that he was involved in an accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix.
* **B: I Piquet Jr. no nandresy (Piquet Jr. won):** The text describes Piquet Jr. deliberately crashing the car, not winning.
* **D: Tratran’ny lozam-piarakodia ilay fiara fiarovana (The safety car was involved in an accident):**  The text states the safety car was deployed *after* Alonso's crash, and Piquet Jr. intentionally crashed into the safety car. It doesn't say the safety car was involved in an accident.
"
Tamin’ny oviana ilay lozam-piarakodia no nitranga?,"The correct answer is **A: Vao avy nijanona i Alonso**.

The text states: ""Nanao lozam-piarakodia i Piquet Jr. Nandritra ny Grad Prix **taorian’ny fijanonan’ny Fernando Alonso**..."" (Piquet Jr. crashed during the Grand Prix **after Fernando Alonso stopped**...).

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no naka fotoana fohy kokoa noho ny ninoan’ny mpanao fikarohana azy tamin’ny voalohany?","The correct answer is **A: Fiforonana karazana biby vaovao**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the new species of finch evolved in just two generations, which is *shorter* than the researchers initially thought.  The passage also mentions the initial belief was that such a change would take longer.  Therefore, the creation of a new species took less time than originally anticipated.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy nanomezan’ny mpanao fikarohana fanazavana?,"The correct answer is **C: Ny anaran’ireo karazana biby vaovao (The name of the new species)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the researchers provided information about *how* the new species evolved** (within two generations through adaptation).  It also mentions the species involved in the evolutionary process.
* **The passage *doesn't* mention the names of the new species.**  It refers to them generally as ""karazana vorona vaovao"" (new bird species) and mentions specific examples like *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza conirostris*.
* **Options A and B are addressed:** The passage explains *how* the new species evolved (adaptation) and mentions the surprisingly short timeframe.
* **Option D is addressed:** The passage specifically names the two species involved in the evolutionary process (*Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza conirostris*).



Therefore, the only thing the researchers *didn't* provide information on was the names of the new bird species.



"
Aiza no hisy ny CowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: Ao amin’ny tanànan’i Bucharest**

The text states: ""Io tanàna io no ho voalohany any amin’ny faritra atsimon’ny Eoropa no handray ny CowParade..."" which translates to ""This city will be the first in the southern part of Europe to host CowParade...""  It then goes on to say the artistic exhibition is part of the Bucharest municipality's efforts. Therefore, the event will be in Bucharest.
"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra marina ny CowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: Izy io no hetsika ara-java-kanto ho an’ny sarababem-bahoaka lehibe indrindra maneran-tany**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Io tanàna io no ho voalohany any amin’ny faritra atsimon’ny Eoropa no handray ny CowParade, izay hetsika ara-java-kanto ho an’ny sarababem-bahoaka lehibe indrindra maneran-tany..."" (This city will be the first in the southern Europe region to host CowParade, which is an art event for the largest public art exhibition in the world...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Any amin’ny tanàna heverina ho “manana aingam-panahy” ihany no misy azy io:** While Bucharest is described as a city with ""spiritual aura,"" the text doesn't say CowParade *only* happens in cities with this aura.
* **B: Noforonin’ny kaominin’ny Bucharest izy io:** The text says the Bucharest municipality *is hosting* CowParade, not that they *created* it.
* **C: Seho artistika atao mandritra ny fahavaratra manerana ny faritra atsimon’ny Eoropa izy io:** While it's an art exhibition happening in the summer and in southern Europe, the text doesn't mention it happening *across* the region. It only mentions Bucharest specifically.



"
Inona no nahatonga an’i Rosia hampiato ny fampiasana an’ireo II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Lozam-pifamoivozana**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tsy navelan’i Rosia hanainga vetivety aloha izay II-76 taorian’izany loza izany."" (Russia did not allow the II-76s to fly immediately after that accident.)  The accident is described as ""lozam-pifamoivozana henjana"" (severe accident). While the investigation was opened for ""famotopotorana"" (sabotage), the immediate cause for halting the aircraft was the accident itself. Therefore, the accident is the direct reason for Russia's action.
"
Inona ny II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Fiaramanidina**.

The text states that the II-76 was a large transport aircraft used extensively by the Russian and Soviet armies since the 1970s. Therefore, it is an aircraft.
"
Iza no nandray ny ekipa mpanoratra ho an’ny Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states: ""tamin’ny 1989 izy no namorona Ny Simsaona niaraka amin’ny Brooks sy Groening, ary **izy no tompon’andraikitra tamin’ny fandraisana ireo ekipa voalohany nanoratra ny seho**."" (in 1989 he created The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and **he was in charge of taking the first writing teams for the show**.)"
"Arak’i Fluke, iza no nandefa fanehoan-kevitra sy ny fampaherezana miabo ho azy?","The correct answer is **D: Na vehivavy na lehilahy**.

The text states: ""na vehivavy na lehilahy, izay nandrisika azy fa tokony ho raisina ho filàna ara-pahasalamana ny fanabeazana aizana.""  This translates to ""either women or men, which encouraged it that sex education should be taken as a health need.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy tian’ny olona sasany horesahina momba ny vehivavy?","The correct answer is **C: Fahasalaman’ny vehivavy (Women's health)**.

The passage states that some people tried to silence women from talking about women's health. The passage also indicates that Fluke's efforts to counter this were successful due to the overwhelming support for women's health education.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no vatana planeta mampiseho fihetsiketsehana be indrindra?","The correct answer is **A: Tany**.

The text states: ""Araka ny fantatsika, dia iray ihany ny vatana planeta mampiseho fihetsiketsehana mihoatra amin’i Titan, Tany no anarany.” This translates to: ""According to what we know, there is only one planet that shows more movement than Titan, and its name is Earth."" Therefore, Earth is the planet with the most movement.
"
Amin’ny vatana planeta iza no nahitana renirano sy farihy misy ranoka mangarahara?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Hanao toy ny rano izy. Mangarahara toy ny rano izy."" (It behaves like water. It glistens like water.) This strongly suggests a liquid on the surface.
* The text then says: ""Araka ny fantatsika, dia iray ihany ny vatana planeta mampiseho fihetsiketsehana mihoatra amin’i Titan, Tany no anarany.” (According to what we know, there is only one planetary body showing activity beyond Titan, and its name is Earth.) This is a bit of a trick – the text is comparing Earth to something else.
* The question asks which planet has rivers and lakes with glistening (water-like) liquids.
* **Titan**, Saturn's moon, is known to have lakes and rivers composed of liquid methane and ethane, which would give them a glistening appearance.

The other options are incorrect:

* **Jupiter:**  Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface with rivers and lakes.
* **Sun:** The Sun is a star and doesn't have any liquid surface features.
* **Saturn:** Saturn is a gas giant and its moons, while interesting, don't have the described features on Saturn itself.



"
Inona amin’ireto zavatra hita ireto no tsy vokatry ny fahitana an’ilay volomborona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny fahazoana fa ireo volomborona dia tsy nampiasaina mba hanidinana.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that researchers believe the feathers were *not* used for gliding or attracting mates.** This is presented as a conclusion drawn *from* the feather structure.
* **The other options are all things directly mentioned as results of finding the feathers:**
    * **A: Ny lokon’ny volon’ilay biby (The color of the bird's feathers)** is mentioned as something that researchers have been able to determine.
    * **C: Fahalalàna bebe kokoa mahakasika ny fivoaranan’ny volomborona (More knowledge about the evolution of feathers)** is stated as a result of the findings.
    * **D: Fanamafisana fa nisy volony ny ankamaroan’ny dinaozaoro (Confirmation that many dinosaurs had feathers)** is the main point of the passage.



Therefore, the statement that the feathers were *not* used for gliding is a conclusion *drawn from* the feathers, not something that is *a result of* finding them.



"
Inona no tsy nananan’ny volon’ny dinaozaoro?,"The correct answer is **B: Rachis**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Koa satria tsy manana tahony mivoatra tsara antsoina hoe rachis ny volon’ny dinôzôro saingy manana endrikà volo hafa tokoa - volombava sy barbules - nanao tsoakevitra ireo mpikaroka fa mety ho fivoarana taty aoriana ilay rachis raha oharina amin’ireo endrika hafa ireo.""

This means the dinosaur feathers didn't have a well-developed rachis (central shaft). They had a different structure - barbules and a vane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Barbules:** The text mentions barbules *as part* of the feather structure.
*   **C: Volomborona matoy:** The text mentions finding well-developed, fluffy feathers (volombava matoy) on juvenile dinosaurs.
*   **D: Lafiny ambany miloko matroka:** The text directly states that the underside of the feathers was a dark color (miloko matroka).



"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ny ZMapp ireto no tsy marina?,"The incorrect statement about ZMapp is **B: Mahavita mitsabo ny aretina efa miseho kanefa tsy afaka misoroka fahafatesana.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states there is no proven treatment for Ebola that can effectively treat the disease *after* it has manifested.**  While ZMapp showed *some* benefit in reducing mortality (mentioned in point D), it wasn't a guaranteed cure for existing cases.  The text focuses on the lack of proven treatments for the active disease.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Vita amin’ny hery fiarovana izy io (It is made from defense herbs):** The text states ZMapp was part of a defense initiative.
* **C: Nampiasaina ho fanarahamaso izy io tamin’ny andrana PALM (It was used as a control in the PALM trial):** The text directly says ZMapp was used as a control in the PALM trial.
* **D: Asehon’ny fikarohana fa ny tombontsoa azo avy aminy dia kely kokoa noho ny noeritreretina tamin’ny voalohany (Research shows the benefits derived from it were less than originally thought):** The text clearly states that the benefits were less than initially anticipated.



Therefore, option B is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the text."
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra marina ny andrana PALM?,"The correct answer is **B: Nisy fanafody fanarahamaso nampitahaina tamin’ny fitsaboana telo hafa, ary iray tamin’izany ny ZMapp.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Tamin’ny andrana PALM, ny ZMapp dia nampiasaina ho fanarahamaso, izay midika fa nampiasain’ny manampahaizana ho fototra iaingana izy io ary nampitahain'izy ireo taminy ireo fitsaboana telo hafa."" (In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, which means that the researchers used it as a baseline and compared it to the other three treatments.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nasehon’ny fikarohana fa mety manana tombontsoa bebe kokoa noho ny noeritreretina tamin’ny voalohany izy io:** While the text mentions the ZMapp trial initially appeared less effective than hoped, it *doesn't* say that subsequent research showed it had more benefit than initially thought.
* **C: Nampiasaina ho fototra iaingan’ilay andrana ny ZMapp:**  This is partially true, but option B is more complete and accurately reflects the trial's design. Option B clarifies that it was a control used for comparison.
* **D: Voaporofo fa mandaitra izy io amin’ny fitsaboana ny aretina efa misy:** The text states that *no effective treatment* for the disease, not that ZMapp was proven effective. The trial was to find effective treatments.



"
Aiza no heverin’ireo mpanao fikarohana fa ho tena ilaina ilay singa vaovao?,"The correct answer is **A: Firenena mahantra**.

The text states: ""...which could help in early detection of diseases like cancer, rabid, HIV and tuberculosis that plague the poor countries, where the mortality rate from diseases like oral cancer is a fraction of that in developed countries."" This directly indicates that the new component is intended to be most useful in poorer nations.
"
Inona ny fomba hampiasaina mba hamoronana an’ilay fitaovana fitiliana?,"The correct answer is **B: Fanaovana pirinty misy ranomainty tsotra**.

The text states: ""...singa kely azo atao pitinty izay azo amboarina raha mampiasa fanaovana pirinty misy ranomainty tsotra mety ho iray santima amerikana."" This directly answers the question of how the device is created.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona amin’ireto fanambarana momba ny lavaka kisilasila ireto no tsy marina?","The correct answer is **D: Tsy betsaka amin’izy ireo no hita teo amin’ny volana (Not many of them are seen on the moon)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Hitan’ireo siantifika ny bikabikan’ny toetran’ny volana antsoina hoe lavaka kisilasila izay avy amin’ny fihenan’ny habehan’ny volana moramora. Itreo vatobe dia hita nandrakotra ny volana ary zara raha simba..."" (Scientists have found features on the moon called regolith, which come from the slow shrinking of the moon. These rocks are seen covering the moon and are barely distinguishable...).  This implies *many* regolith features *are* visible.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Ny zava-nisy nahatonga azy ireo hiforona dia inoana fa nitranga vao haingana (The events that caused them to form are believed to have happened recently):** The text directly says the regolith are ""vao haingana"" (recently).
* **B: Ny fisian’izy ireo dia mampiseho fa ny volana dia tsy hoe tsy ampy tranga ara-jeolojika (Their existence shows that the moon is not geologically inactive):** The text explicitly states this is the opposite of the belief that the moon is geologically inactive.
* **C: Mety ho vokatry ny fihenan’ny habehan’ny volana izy ireo (They may be a result of the moon shrinking):** The text clearly states the regolith ""avy amin’ny fihenan’ny habehan’ny volana moramora"" (come from the slow shrinking of the moon).



Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the text.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, teôria inona momba ny bikabikan’ny toetran’ny volana no mampiseho fa misy tranga ara-jeolojika mitranga eny amin’ny volana?","The correct answer is **D: Vao haingana no niforona ireo bikabikan’ny toetran’ny volana.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""lava kisilasila"" (craters) are ""very fresh"" and show recent geological activity. This directly contradicts the idea that the Moon is geologically inactive. Option D, ""Vao haingana no niforona ireo bikabikan’ny toetran’ny volana"" (The craters formed recently), aligns perfectly with this statement.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mihena tsikelikely ny habehan’ny volana:** While true, the Moon's shrinking size isn't the *reason* for the geological activity discussed. It's a separate fact.
*   **B: Niforona efa ela be taloha ireo bikabikan’ny toetran’ny volana eo amin’ny volana:** This contradicts the passage's statement about the craters being very fresh.
*   **C: Faran’izay vitsy ireo bikabikan’ny toetran’ny volana eo amin’ny volana:** This is not mentioned in the text and is the opposite of what the text describes.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy hisy intsony mandra-pahatongan’ilay fiampangana?","The correct answer is **A: Filazana manokana**.

The text states: ""Biraon’ny Satro-boninahitra, izay voapanga amin’ny ankamaroany, dia nanambara tamin’ireo mpanao gazety fa **tsy misy ny filazana manokana** mandra-pahatonga ny didim-pitsarana.""

This means that no specific details about the charges will be released until the trial is concluded.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy olana amin’izao fotoana izao ho an’ireo mpanidy?","The correct answer is **C: Hatevenan’ny ranomandry**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Habetsahana sy hatevenan’ny oram-panala miangona, raha i Pittman, dia ratsy indrindra nandritry ny 15 taona izay raha ho an’ireo mpanidy izany."" This directly indicates that the **high salinity (hatevenan'ny ranomandry)** is the biggest problem for the fishermen.

While the other options are mentioned in the text, they aren't specifically identified as the *primary* problem for the fishermen.  The text frames the salinity and the salt accumulation as a major issue impacting the fishermen's livelihoods.
"
"Ankoatra ny ranomandry, inona ihany koa no misy fiantraikany amin’ny ezaka famonjena?","The correct answer is **B: Toetrandro (Environment)**.

The text explicitly states that ""ny toetrandro faran'izay ratsy"" (the bad environmental conditions) are hindering rescue efforts. The question asks for something *besides* the rain (ranomandry) that is affecting rescue efforts, and the answer is the overall environmental state.
"
Inona no finoana nolavin’i Roberts ny nanamafy azy?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny mahazava-dehibe ny fanapahan-kevitra mitombona raisin’ny Fitsarana Faratampony**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Roberts reiterated that *Roe v. Wade* is ""law settled by the nation"" and emphasized the ""importance of the unanimous decision made by the Supreme Court."" This directly points to his belief in the significance of the Supreme Court's prior ruling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ny maha etika ny firesahana momba ny tranga** - Roberts explicitly stated the opposite, that it's *not* ethical to discuss the details of the case.
* **C: Ny fiantombohan’ny fiainana** - Roberts acknowledged the importance of the concept of the beginning of life (as mentioned in the first paragraph), but the question asks about *what he believed he was reaffirming*.
* **D: Fanomezana ny zo’ny tsirairay** - While Roberts affirmed the importance of individual rights (specifically in relation to the Roe decision), the core of his statement was about reaffirming the importance of the previous Supreme Court ruling.



"
Inona ny lohahevitra tsapan’i Roberts fa tsy etika ny miresaka momba azy?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny antsipirian’ny tranga**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Roberts said it was ""unethical to speculate about the details of the case."" Therefore, he feels discussing the specific details of the case is unethical. While he acknowledges the significance of *Roe v. Wade* and the importance of individual liberty, the question specifically asks what he finds unethical to discuss - the details of the case.



"
Aiza ireo tara-pahazavana no manazava?,"The correct answer is **A: Mankany amin’ny lanitra (Towards the sky)**.

The text states: ""Tara-pahazavana anankiroa no nampiakarina mba hanondro ny lanitra mandritry ny alina."" which translates to ""Two bright stars were hoisted to point to the sky during the night.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, rahoviana ireo tranobe manaka-danitra vaovao no aoriana eo amin’ilay toerana?","The correct answer is **D: Eo am-panaovana ny fanorenana**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mandeha ny fanamboarana ho an’ny tranobe manaka-danitra dimy vaovao eo amin’ilay toerana..."" This translates to ""The construction of five new high-rise buildings is underway at that location...""

This means the buildings are *in the process of being built*, not completed, not specifically at 8:46 am, and not just happening at night.
"
Inona no fanazavana mampiseho fa ny The Seven Sisters dia mety ho lavabato?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny fiovaovan’ny maripana (The change in brightness)**.

The passage states: ""The infrared images show that, according to the change in brightness between night and day, they appear to be very likely to be volcanoes."" This directly links the fluctuating brightness to the possibility of them being volcanoes.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ny savaivon’ny fidirana anaty lavabato (The diameter of the lava throat):** While the diameter is a characteristic of volcanoes, it doesn't *prove* they are volcanoes.
* **C: Fanaraha-maso ara-jeolojika (Geological monitoring):** The passage mentions geological monitoring *by* USGS, but doesn't say the monitoring *explains* why they are volcanoes.
* **D: Sarin’ny lavabato eto amin’ny Tany (Images of volcanoes on Earth):** Comparing them to volcanoes on Earth is suggestive, but not a direct explanation. The key explanation is the brightness change.



"
Amin’ny fomba ahoana no handinihana ny fiovaovan’ny hafanàn’ny Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **A: Sary avy amin’ny taratra infrarouges**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sary avy amin’ny taratra infrarouges dia mampiseho fa, araka ny fiovaovan’ny maripana amin’ny alina sy amin’ny andro dia hita fa tena mety ho lavabato izy io."" (Infrared imagery shows that, according to the change in the spectrum between day and night, they are indeed likely to be lava tubes.)

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lavaka lalina amin’ny tany** is a potential *reason* for the temperature variations, but not the *method* of studying them.
*   **C: Ny savaivon’ny lavabato** is a physical characteristic, but not a method for studying temperature changes.
*   **D: Fanaraha-maso an’ireo lavabato eto amin’ny Tany** is mentioned as a comparison point, but not the method for studying the Seven Sisters specifically.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona amin’ireto fanambarana momba ilay ahiahiana ireto no tsy marina?","The correct answer is **D: Tsy naratra izy** (He was not injured).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Notazonina ilay rangahy nahiahiana ho nanapoaka an’ilay baomba, rehefa naratra vokatr’ilay fipoahana izy."" This translates to: ""The man suspected of planting the bomb was detained when he was injured by the explosion."" Therefore, he *was* injured.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

* **A: Nampiasa fiara izy nandritra ilay fanafihana** (He used a car during the attack): The text explicitly says he drove a car with a three-wheeled cart to deliver the bomb.
* **B: Voalaza fa nanapoaka baomba izy** (It is said that he planted a bomb): The text states he is *suspected* of planting the bomb.
* **C: Fantatry ny manam-pahefana ny vondrom-poko misy azy** (The authorities know his ethnic group): The text states he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group.



Therefore, the only incorrect statement is **D**."
Inona ny fanazavana momba ilay fanafihana izay nohamafisin’ny manam-pahefana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny vondrom-poko misy an’ilay ahiahiana**.

Here's why:

* The text states the man is identified as a member of the Uighur ethnic group. This is the primary piece of information the authorities are focusing on related to the bombing.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Inona ny fanazavana momba ilay fanafihana izay nohamafisin’ny manam-pahefana?** (What is the explanation of the bombing that the authorities have emphasized?) - While the authorities have emphasized the Uighur ethnicity, this option asks about the *explanation* of the bombing itself, not what they've emphasized.
* **C: Ny antony nanaovany an’ilay fanafihana** (The reason he committed the bombing) - The text doesn't provide any information about the motive.
* **D: Ny anarana sy fanampin’anaran’ilay ahiahiana** (The name and surname of the suspect) - The text explicitly states they don't know his name.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the authorities' current focus is on the ethnic group the suspect belongs to.

Iza no ekipa hilalao amin’ilay lalao ao amin’ny kianjan’i Elisy?,"The correct answer is **A: All Blacks sy Aostralia**.

The text states: ""The final will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg the following weekend, with the Springboks facing **Australia**."""
Aiza ny Springboks no hanao ny lalaon’izy ireo manaraka?,"The correct answer is **A: Aostralia**.

The text states: ""Faharesena indimy mifanesy no niafarany ho an’ny Springboks. Ity no lalao famaranana ho an’ny All Blacks, izay efa nahazo ny amboara roa herinandro lasa izay. **Ny famaranana ny andian-dalao dia ho tanterahina any amin’ny kianja’i Elisy any Johannesburg amin’ny herinandro ambony, ifaninanan’ny Springboks amin’i Aostralia.**""
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no nahitan’ilay fiantsonana an’habakabaka olana nandritra an’ilay iraka?,"The correct answer is **B: Fihazonana gyroscope**.

The passage states: ""Tsy nanova fihetsika ny fiantsonana, na dia teo ary ny fahaverezan’ny gyroscope iray teo aloha kelin’izay nandritra ny iraka nataon’ilay fiantsonana an’habakabaka...""  This translates to: ""The station did not change its orientation, even though there was a loss of one gyroscope earlier during the spacewalk...""  Therefore, the loss of the gyroscope caused a problem with orientation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mitazona ny halavirana araka ny tokony ho izy amin’ireo propulseurs** (Maintaining the proper distance from the thrusters): The astronauts successfully maintained the proper distance. The passage says they ""reported no dangerous distances"" to the thrusters.
* **C: Famelomana fantsitsitra** (Firing thrusters):  The astronauts used thrusters, but the initial problem was the gyroscope loss, not a problem with firing thrusters.  The thrusters were used to correct the situation after the loss.
* **D: Fahazoana hahavo araka ny tokony ho izy indray** (Regaining the proper orientation): This is the *result* of correcting the gyroscope issue, not the initial problem.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tanjon’ilay iraka nataon’ilay fiantsonana an’habakabaka?","The correct answer is **C: Mamita fivoahana an’habakabaka**.

The text explicitly states: ""...mandra-pahatapitry ny fivoahana an’habakabaka."" (until the spacewalk was completed).  The other options are incorrect as the text indicates the spacewalk was *completed* and the other actions were related to the problems that occurred *during* the spacewalk.
"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto momba an’ilay raharaha no tsy marina?,"The incorrect statement is **A: Tao amin’ilay fanjakana misy ny foiben’ny AOL no nanenjehana an’ilay raharaha** (The state where AOL's headquarters is located pursued the case).

Here's why:

The passage states that Virginia is pursuing the case, because AOL, the internet provider, is located there. It *doesn't* say that the state *where AOL's headquarters is located* is pursuing the case.  It's simply that Virginia is the state involved.

The other statements are accurate according to the text:

* **B: Nisy fanamelohana** (There was spamming) - The passage explicitly mentions ""fanamelohana tamin’ny alàlan’ilay lalàna nivoaka tamin’ny 2003 natao hamerana ny tambatra mailaka tsy irina"" (spamming through the 2003 law to stop unwanted email).
* **C: Nampiasaina tamin’ilay raharaha ny lalàna momba ny mailaka tsy irina** (The anti-spam law was used in the case) - The passage states this directly.
* **D: Notoriana ny AOL** (AOL was targeted) - The passage says ""mailaka tsy nangatahana any anaty boaty mailaky ny mpanjifa"" (unsolicited email into customer inboxes), which means AOL was the target of the spam.



Therefore, the answer is **A**."
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra marina an’ilay raharaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Notoriana ny AOL noho ny fanaovana fizaràna mailaka tsy nangatahana.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Tany Virjinia is dealing with the issue because AOL, a major internet provider, was the one responsible for sending unsolicited bulk email.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nahavoasaringotra mpamatsy serivisy aterineto sangany roa ilay raharaha:** The text only mentions AOL, not two internet providers.
* **C: Tamin’ny 2003 no nanenjehana an’ilay raharaha:**  While the law mentioned was from 2003, the text focuses on AOL's responsibility for sending the unsolicited emails.
* **D: AOL no nanomboka ny fanenjehana an’ilay raharaha:** The text states that *Tany Virjinia* is dealing with the issue, implying they are investigating or taking action related to AOL's actions.  It doesn't say AOL initiated the investigation.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no klioba nanombohan’i Vidal nilalao vanin-taom-pilalaovana telo teo aloha?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The text states: ""Vidal, 28 taona, taom-pilalaovana telo teo aloha, **avy ao amin'ny Sevilla**."" which translates to ""Vidal, 28 years old, three seasons ago, **from Sevilla**.""
"
Firy ny lalao nolalaovin’i Vidal ho an’ny Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hatramin’ny nifindrana tao amin’ny renivohitry ny Katalana dia nilalao kilalao **49** ho an’i klioba i Vidal."" (Since transferring to the Catalan capital, Vidal has played **49** games for the club.)
"
Iza no ekipa nifanandrinana tamin’ilay lalao?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text states that the match is against Bologna (""haonana amin’i Bolonia"")."
Nahoana i Jarque no nijanona tao amin’ny hotely?,"The correct answer is **B: Nisy fivoriana mialoha ny taom-pilalaovana nataony.**

The text explicitly states that Jarque went to the team's hotel *before* the match against Bologna and that he was preparing for the upcoming season. This indicates a pre-season meeting or training session.
"
Nahoana ny masoivoho misahana ny haitoetany ao Jakarta no tsy namoaka filazana fanairana?,"The correct answer is **D: Tsy nahafeno ny fepetra mitaky hamafy ilaina ilay izy.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tsy nisy ny filazana fanairana horohoron-tany an-dranomasina, ary raha ny masoivoho misahana ny haitoetany dia tsy hisy mihitsy izany filazana fanairana horohoron-tany an-dranomasina izany satria tsy nahafeno ny fepetra mitaky hamafy 6,5 ilay horohoron-tany."" (There was no tsunami warning, and the coastal warning agency would not have issued a tsunami warning because the earthquake did not meet the 6.5 magnitude requirement.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsy nisy tandindonà tsunami:**  The passage states there were *no* tsunami indicators, but this is *why* a warning wasn't issued, not *the reason* the agency didn't issue one.
* **B: Mba tsy hampisavoritaka ny mponina:** This is the opposite of what would happen.  A warning is intended to *prepare* people, not to discourage them from evacuating.
* **C: Mba hialana amin’ny fiantraikany eo amin’ny asan’ny mponina:** This is not a valid reason for not issuing a warning. The primary concern is public safety.



Therefore, the only reason supported by the passage is that the earthquake's magnitude (6.5) was below the threshold for issuing a tsunami warning."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no vokatr’ilay horohoron-tany?","The correct answer is **A: Nisavoritaka ny mponina (The inhabitants started to evacuate)**.

The passage states: ""Na dia tsy nisy tandindonà tsunami aza, dia nanomboka nisavoritaka ny mponina ary nanomboka nandao ny asany sy ny tranony.""  (Even though there was no tsunami warning, the inhabitants started to evacuate and began to leave their work and their homes.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tandindonà tsunami (Tsunami warning):** The passage explicitly states there was no tsunami warning.
* **C: Filazana fanairana (Earthquake warning):**  The passage says there were no earthquake warnings.
* **D: 6.5 ny hamafin'ny horohoron-tany (The earthquake's magnitude was 6.5):** The passage says the earthquake did *not* meet the criteria for a magnitude of 6.5.
"
Iza amin’ireto no mahatonga ny hetsiky ny Masoandro sy ny kintana hafa?,"The correct answer is **D: Hazavana, tarehimarika Rossby ary fihodinana**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the ""hetsiky ny kintana ao amin’ny rafitra dia hita fa miankina amin’ny hazavany, ny fiodinanany ary izay ihany."" (The dynamics of the storm system can be seen to depend on its brightness, rotation, and so on.)
* It also mentions that ""ny hazavana sy fihodinana dia nampiasaina miaraka mba hahafantarana ny tarehimarika Rossby an’ilay kintana..."" (brightness and rotation were used together to identify the Rossby wave number of the storm...)
* Finally, it says that ""Arakaraka ny mahakely ny isan’i Rossby no tsy dia mampivadibadika ny hery maninton’ilay kintana."" (According to the reduction in the Rossby number, the storm's storm-driving force is not so destabilized.)

Therefore, all three options (brightness, rotation, and Rossby wave number) are factors influencing the dynamics of storms."
Ahoana no hahafantarana ny tarehimarika Rossby an’ny kintana iray?,"The correct answer is **A: Hazavana sy fihodinana**.

The text states: ""Hazavana sy fihodinana dia nampiasaina miaraka mba hahafantarana ny tarehimarika Rossby an’ilay kintana."" This directly translates to ""Brightness and rotation were used together to identify the Rossby number of the cyclone.""
"
Firy isan-jato amin’ny olona nanontaniana no manohana ny fivadihan’i Aostralia ho repoblika avy hatrany?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 isan-jato**.

The question asks about the percentage of people who support an immediate transition to a republic. The text states: ""Tamin’ny faran’ny fitsapa-kevi-bahoaka dia hita fa **29 isan-jaton’ireo nanontaniana no mihevitra fa tokony hivadika repoblika faran’izay haingana i Aostralia**..."" (At the end of the poll, it was found that 29 percent of those questioned believed that Australia should transition to a republic as soon as possible...).

Option B accurately reflects this information. Option A refers to the percentage of people who support the transition *eventually*, not immediately. The other options are incorrect because they refer to different percentages or topics.
"
"Arak’i Julie Gillard, rahoviana no tokony haha-repoblika an’i Aostralia?","The correct answer is **B: Aorian’ny fanjakan’ny mpanjakavavy Elizabeta II.**

The text explicitly states: ""nilaza nandritra ny fampielezan-kevitry ny fifidianana federaly tamin’ny 2010 fa mino ny tokony haha-repoblika an'i Aostralia amin’ny **fiafaran’ny fanjakan’ny mpanjakavavy Elizabeta II** izy."" (declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.)

Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of Julia Gillard's view."
Fikambanana iza no anaty famotorana?,"The correct answer is **C: Fandrindrana Fiainam-pianakaviana**.

The passage states that the new Komen Foundation policy prevents donations to organizations ""currently under investigation.""  It then goes on to say the investigation is into Planned Parenthood. Therefore, Planned Parenthood is the organization under investigation. The question asks which organization is ""under investigation."" The passage directly states this is the Family Planning. 
"
Filohan’ny kaomity inona i Cliff Stearns?,"The correct answer is **A: House Energy and Commerce Committee**.

The text states: ""...ambany fifehezan’ny House Energy and Commerce Committee."" This means Cliff Stearns is the chairman of that committee.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy nanjo an’ilay ramatoa Soisy?","The correct answer is **D: Nisy nangalatra ny solosainany sy findainy (Someone stole her computer and phone)**.

The passage states that someone stole Soisy's computer and phone. The police recovered these items. Therefore, the act of having her computer and phone stolen is what happened to her, and it's what the question asks about.
"
Orinasa iza no nahazo ny maripankasitrahana Taiwan Sustainable Award tamin’ny 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""Fa ho lasa feno karazany sy hiova tanteraka ny tsenan’ny mpanjifa solosaina azo entina mandehandeha aorian’ny nahazoan’ny ASUS maripankasitrahana tanatin'ny Taiwan Sustainable Award 2007 avy amin’ny Yuan mpanatanteraka ao amin’ny Repoblikan’i Sina."" This translates to: ""But it will become diverse and completely change the portable computer market after ASUS received the Taiwan Sustainable Award 2007 from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China.""
"
Inona ny ASUS Eeee PC?,"The correct answer is **B: Solosaina (Computer)**.

The text explicitly states that it's an ""ASUS Eeee PC"" and later refers to the ""solosaina solosaina azo entina mandehandeha"" which translates to ""portable computer."" Therefore, it's a computer.
"
Iza no tompon’andraikitra ny amin’ireo antontan-taratasy tsy hita?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpiasan’ny paositra** (Postal workers).

Here's why:

The text states that a man showed anger towards postal workers for not delivering 429 New Year's greeting cards.  This directly implicates the postal workers as being responsible for the missing documents. The other options aren't supported by the text.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no naneho ny fialan-tsininy mahakasika an’ireo antontan-taratasy tsy hita?","The correct answer is **B: Ilay zazalahy**.

The text states: ""Naneho ny fialan-tsininy tamin’ny olom-pirenena sy ny haino aman-jery ny paositra omaly ireo zazalahy..."" This directly indicates that the young man expressed his dissatisfaction.
"
Tamin’ny oviana i Del Potro no nila nitsano ny sorony?,"The correct answer is **C: Nandritra ny seta faharoa**.

The text states: ""Nanana tombony alohaloha i Del Potro teo amin’ny sety faharoa, saingy nila tie break koa izany taorian’ny nahatratrarana ny 6-6."" This means the tie-break happened during the second set. The text also mentions ""Mbola tsaboina ny sorok’i Potro amin’izao, nefa tonga nanohy ilay lalao ihany izy."" This indicates he was injured during the match, and the injury is to his wrist, implying it happened *during* the match, and the tie-break in the second set is where the injury occurred.
"
Inona no vokatry ny tie break voalohany?,"The correct answer is **B: Navotsotr’i Del Potro ilay izy taorian’ny ratra nahazo azy.**

Here's why:

* The question states that the second set went to a tiebreak after reaching 6-6.
* The question also mentions that Del Potro had an early lead in the second set.
* Therefore, Del Potro won the tiebreak, giving him the set.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Navotsotr’i Murray ilay izy tamin’ny seta voalohany:** The question states Murray lost the first set *in a tiebreak*, not that he lost it outright.
* **C: Azon’i Murray ilay izy teo amin’ny seta faharoa:** The question indicates Del Potro had a lead and the set went to a tiebreak. 
* **D: Azon’i Del Potro ilay izy teo amin’ny seta faharoa:** While Del Potro *won* the second set, the question specifically asks about the *tiebreak*, which is implied to have happened *after* reaching 6-6. Option B is the only one that mentions the tiebreak correctly.

"Araka ny voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no voasinga manokana, voalaza fa nifampikasoka tamin’ny marary iray?","The correct answer is **B: Ankizy**.

The text states: ""Fantatra androany fa nisy ankizy anaty salan-taonan’ny mpianatra nifandray tamin’ilay marary."" (It is known today that some children of students were in contact with the patient.)"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no fanomezan-toky tsy nomen’ilay governora rehefa niresaka tamin’ny mponin’i Texas izy?","The correct answer is **B: Misy fepetra raisina mba hiarovana ny filaminan’ny mponina.**

The text explicitly states: ""Hoy Perry, ”Vitsy ny toerana eran-tany izay afaka miatrika ny fanamby lehibe aterak’ity tranga ity.“ Nanambara ihany koa ny governora: “Fantatra androany fa nisy ankizy anaty salan-taonan’ny mpianatra nifandray tamin’ilay marary.” Nilaza izy hoe, “zava-doza ity raharaha ity. Matokia fa efa manao izay azo atao ny rafitra misy eto amin’ny.” This translates to: ""Perry said, 'Few places in the world are able to withstand the great surge caused by this incident.' The governor also stated, 'It is known today that children of students who had contact with the patient were involved.' He said, 'This is a regrettable incident. Believe that the system here is doing all it can.'""

Option B accurately reflects what the governor assured the people of Texas.
"
Tahaka mahatsikaiky ny vaovao inona no noforonin’ny mpianatra roa teo aloha tao amin’ny UW?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The text states: ""Hatramin'ny niandohany, lasa manjaka tanteraka eo amin'ny fanaovana dika maneso ny vaovao ny **The Onion**...""

While The Daily Show and The Colbert Report are mentioned as inspirations, The Onion is highlighted as the originator of satirical news."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto no tsy tafiditra ao anatin'ilay vaovao maneson'ny The Onion ?","The correct answer is **B: Sarimihetsika**.

The passage lists the following as part of The Onion's news satire:

*   Dika voatonta (Parodies)
*   Tranonkala (Website)
*   Dokambarotra manokana (Special issues)
*   Tambajotram-baovao 24 ora (24-hour news feed)
*   Rakipeo an-tserasera (Podcasts)
*   Atlas manerantany (Atlas of Our Dumb World)

A film is not mentioned in the passage as something The Onion produces."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no nandrasan’ny polisy?","The correct answer is **C: Fidirana amin’ny lalana Downing**.

The text states: ""P: Nanaomboka teo ho eo amin’ny 11 ora amin’ny ora eo an-toerana (UTC+1) teo ny fanoherana teo amin’ny Whitehall mifanohitra amin’ny varavarana andrasan’ny polisy ao amin’ny làlana Downing...""

This directly indicates that the police were blocking access to Downing Street.
"
Tamin’ny firy ny pôlisy no nangataka an’ireo mpanao fihetsiketsehana mba hifindra mba tsy hisian’ny fizotran’ny fifamoivozana bebe kokoa?,"The correct answer is **D: Tamin’ny 11:20**.

The text states: ""Tamin’ny 11:20, nangataka ireo mpanao fihetsiketsehana ny pôlisy mba hiakatra amin’ny toerana fandehanan’ny mpandeha tongotra, nilaza fa tsy maintsy ampifandajana ny fahafahana maneho hevitra sy ny fizotran’ny fifamoivozana."" (At 11:20, the protesters asked the police to move to a pedestrian route, stating they needed to balance the right to free speech and traffic flow.)
"
Inona no marina momba ny fikarohana nataon’ny Dr.Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **C: Manantena izy fa ireo vokapikarohana dia mety hitondra fanasitranana an’ilay aretina.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...Dr.Ehud Ur...has cautioned that research is still in its early stages. Like some other researchers, he remains hesitant about whether diabetes can be cured..."" This indicates he's *not* certain about a cure, but that the research *could* potentially lead to one.
* **Option A is incorrect** because Dr. Ur explicitly states the research results are not comparable to those with Type 1 diabetes.
* **Option B is incorrect** because the text says they are *not* now diabetic, but it doesn't say they are cured.
* **Option D is incorrect** because the text says they were *not* previously diabetic, but now are.

Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately reflects the information presented in the text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mampisalasala an’i Dr. Ur?","The correct answer is **B: Raha toa ka afaka sitranina ilay aretina** (Whether diabetes can be cured).

The text states: ""misalasala ihany izy ny amin’ny hoe afaka sitranina ve ny diabeta sa tsia"" which translates to ""he is only hesitant about whether diabetes can be cured or not.""  The text explicitly mentions his uncertainty about a cure.
"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina ny fianjeran’ny Flight CG4684?,"The answer is **C: Nianjera tany amin’ny toerana tena mitokana ilay fiara-manidina** (The plane crashed in a very isolated place).

Here's why:

* The passage states the plane crashed in the Kokoda region. While remote, it doesn't explicitly say it was in an *extremely* isolated place. The other options are directly supported by the text.
* **A: Tsy tafapetraka ilay fiara-manidina noho ny toetr’andro** (The plane did not land due to bad weather) - This is directly stated in the passage: ""Tsy tontosa ny fikarohana noho ilay toetr’andro ratsy iny ihany..."" (The search was not completed due to the bad weather...).
* **B: Nianjera tany amin’ny toerana tena mitokana ilay fiara-manidina** (The plane crashed in a very isolated place) - While the passage doesn't use the phrase ""very isolated,"" the Kokoda region is known for its remoteness, so this is a reasonable inference.
* **D: Nisy fiantraikany teo amin’ny fikarohana an’ilay toerana nianjeran’ilay fiara-manidina ny toetr’andro** (The weather had an impact on the search for the location of the plane crash) - This is also directly stated in the passage: ""ka nanakana ny fidinan'ny fiara-manidina izany"" (so it prevented the plane from flying).



Therefore, option C is the only statement that is *not* explicitly supported by the text."
Inona no nahatonga ny Flight CG4684 tsy nahatody ny fipetrahany?,"The correct answer is **D: Ratsy ny toetr’andro**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tsy tontosa ny fikarohana noho ilay toetr'andro ratsy iny ihany, ka nanakana ny fidinan'ny fiara-manidina izany."" which translates to ""The search was not completed due to the bad weather, which prevented the flight from taking off.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ny traikefan’i Franciszek Kowal ireto no marina?","The correct answer is **B: Tsy naninona izy.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Soa ihany fa Soa ihany fa tsy naninona aho..."" which translates to ""It's just lucky that I didn't mind..."" This directly indicates that Franciszek Kowal was not bothered by the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Afaka namaky fitaratra izy:** The text says people *tried* to read his palms, but it doesn't say he could read them himself.
* **C: Namotika seza izy teo am-piezahana hitsoaka:** The text says people ""squeezed the chair"" when trying to read his palms, not that he damaged the chair.
* **D: Naratra izy teo am-panandramana hamaky varavarankely:** The text says that the palms started coming out of the door, not that he was trying to read the door.



"
Nahoana no sarotra ny mamantatra ny mety ho fiantraikan’ny Rivo-doza tropikaly Daniella?,"The correct answer is **D: Lavitra loatra an’i Miami ilay rivo-doza**.

Here's why: The passage states: ""Satria mbola tsy miditra an-tanety ny tafio-drivotra dia mbola sarotra ny mamantatra ny mety ho fiantraikany ao Amerika sy Karaiba.""  This translates to: ""Because the storm has not yet made landfall, it is still difficult to determine its potential impact on America and the Caribbean.""  The phrase ""Lavitra loatra an’i Miami ilay rivo-doza"" is a slightly awkward way of saying that the storm is far from Miami.  The key point is its distance from land makes predicting impacts difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Heverina fa hihamafy ho tafio-drivotra ilay rivo-doza:** This is *why* they expect to monitor it, not *why* it's hard to predict impacts.
* **B: Misalasala ny amin’ny herin-drivotra mafy indrindra an’ilay rivo-doza ny siantifika:** The passage actually *states* the maximum wind speed (40 mph). This isn't the reason for the difficulty in predicting impacts.
* **C: Lavitra loatra ny tanety ilay rivo-doza:** While the storm *is* far from land, the passage specifically mentions the difficulty in predicting impacts on *America and the Caribbean*, not the overall impact on land. The distance from Miami is the relevant detail.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana momba ny Rivo-doza Tropikaly Daniella ireto no tsy marina?","The correct answer is **D: Akaikin’ny tanety izy io** (It is approaching land).

The text explicitly states: ""Satria mbola tsy miditra an-tanety ny tafio-drivotra dia mbola sarotra ny mamantatra ny mety ho fiantraikany ao Amerika sy Karaiba."" (Because the storm has not yet entered land, it is still difficult to predict its potential impacts on America and the Caribbean.)

Therefore, option D is incorrect because the storm is *not* approaching land, it has not yet entered it. The other options are all supported by the text.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no voalaza fa tsy maintsy mitranga amin’ilay aretina alohan’ny hiterahany valanaretina maneran-tany?","The correct answer is **A: Tsy maintsy mihena ny taha-pahafatesana aterak’ilay izy.**

The text states: ""Misy fandinihana sasany mandroso hevitra fa **tsy maitsy mihena ny taha-pahafatesa** aterak’ilay aretina alohan’ny ahafahany miparitaka manerana an’izao tontolo izao..."" (Some preliminary investigations suggest that **it is not good if the fatality rate decreases** before it can spread across the globe...). This directly indicates that a decrease in the fatality rate is a necessary condition before the disease can become widespread.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tokony hijanona ho maivamaivana ny soritraretina:** While the text mentions the symptoms being mild, it's not presented as a *necessary* condition for global spread. The main concern is the fatality rate.
* **C: Tokony hihamaro ny olona tratran’ilay izy:**  The text actually expresses *concern* that the disease might remain mild and *continue* to spread to more people. The concern is *not* that the number of cases should increase.
* **D: Tokony hisy soritraretina eo amin’ny ankizy:** The text specifies that the disease is affecting children, but it doesn't say the *presence* of symptoms is a prerequisite for global spread. The key is the fatality rate.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, hoatran’ny ahoana ny halaviran’ilay tafio-drivotra tamin’i Fujian?","The correct answer is **C: 70 kilaometatra**.

The passage states: ""Ny alin’ny 9 Aogositra dia teo ho eo amin’ny 70 kilaometatra miala ny faritany sinoa Fujian ny mason’ny rivodoza Morakot."" which translates to ""On the night of August 9th, the eye of the Morakot cyclone was approximately 70 kilometers away from the Fujian province in China.""
"
Iza no nandray an’i George W. Bush rehetra tonga tany Asia izy?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng sy Lee Hsien Loong**.

The text states that he was received by Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Therefore, both of them received him.
"
Tamin’ny oviana ny filoha no niresaka momba ny fanitarana ny varotra any Azia?,"The correct answer is **C: Taorian’ny fahareseny tamin’ny fifidianana eo amin’ny atsasan’ny fe-potoana fiasana.**

The text states: ""Taorian’ny herinandro fatiantoka nandritra ny fifidianana antenantenam-potoana dia niresaka momba ny fanitarana ny varotra any Azia tamin'ny mpanatrika i Bush.""  This clearly indicates the discussion about boosting trade in Asia happened after the election period.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tanjona ankapoben’ny governemanta?","The correct answer is **D: Hanamaivana ny fahamaroan’ny olona be loatra**.

Here's why:

The passage states the government's recent announcement is an *extension* of a March initiative to provide transportation funding. The *purpose* of that initiative, as stated in the passage, is to ""hanamaivana ny fahamaroan’ny olona be loatra"" (reduce overcrowding).

While options A, B, and C mention specific numbers or timelines, they are *means* to achieve the ultimate goal stated in the passage, which is to reduce overcrowding. Therefore, D is the most accurate answer representing the overall objective.
"
Inona no fanambarana nataon’ny governemanta?,"The correct answer is **B: Manana finiavana ny hanamaivana ny olana momba ny fitaterana izy ireo.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the government ""nanitatra ny finiavananta tamin’ny Martsa tamin’ity taona ity ny hamatsy vola ny fitaterana mihoatra"".  This directly translates to ""extended its intention from March this year to fund transportation beyond.""  Therefore, the government's statement is to **intend to alleviate the transportation problem.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mieritreritra ny hamatsy vola fitaterana 300 fanampiny izy ireo** - This is only part of the news, not the main statement. It's about the *amount* of funding, not the overall intention.
* **C: Mieritreritra ny hamatsy vola fitaterana 1.300 fanampiny izy ireo** - Similar to A, this is specific detail and not the overarching statement. It focuses on the number of vehicles.
* **D: Ho voavaha alohan’ny Martsa ny olana momba ny fahamaroan’ny olona be loatra** - The passage mentions an intention extended from March, *not* that the problem will be solved by then.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, fampahalalana inona no fantatra?","The correct answer is **C: Misy fanafihana andrasana**.

Here's why:

* The first sentence of Nilaza's quote explicitly states: ""Tsy misy vaovao ahafahana miteny fa misy fanafihana efa antomotra andrasana."" This translates to ""There is no news to say that an attack is already underway, but an attack is being prepared.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nihena ny fahamafisan’ny filazana loza** - While this is mentioned, it's a consequence of the situation, not a fundamental piece of information about what is happening.
* **B: Tsy misy loza atahorana intsony** - This is directly contradicted by Nilaza's statement about a prepared attack.
* **D: Nohamafisin’ny vaovao fa ho mafy ny fanafihana** - The quote doesn't mention the severity of the attack, only that it's being prepared.



"
Inona amin’ireto fanambarana mahakasika ny fanoherana ireto no tsy marina?,"The incorrect statement is **C: Mangataka ny fametram-pialan'ny CEP teo aloha ireo mpanao fanoherana.**

The text states that the committee was formed *as a response to the opposition's strong opposition to the government*. It doesn't say the opposition *requested* the previous committee's resignation. The committee is Martelly's response to the opposition.

Here's why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Ilay vaomiera notendren'ny filoha dia valinteny ho an’ilay fanoherana:** The text explicitly says, ""Ny vaomiera no valintenin’i Martelly ho an’ireo fanoherana faobe ny fitondrana..."" (The committee is Martelly's response to the opposition...).
*   **B: Vokatry ny fahataran’ny fifidianana ireo fanoherana:** The text states, ""Ireo fanoherana izay misy hery setra indrainday dia vokatry ny tsy fisian’ny fifidianana..."" (Some of the opposition's strong opposition is a result of the lack of elections...).
*   **D: Nisy hery setra indraindray ireo fanoherana:** The text says, ""Ireo fanoherana izay misy hery setra indrainday..."" (Some of the opposition's strong opposition...).

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
Iza no nandroso hevitra ny fametram-pialan’ny CEP farany?,"The correct answer is **C: Ilay vaomiera notendren'ny filoha**.

The text states: ""Ny volana lasa teo dia nisy vaomiera notendren'ny filoha nandroso ny fametram-pialan'ny CEP teo aloha ho anisan’ny vondrona fepetra..."" which translates to ""Last month, a committee appointed by the president developed the restructuring of the former CEP as a group of measures...""
"
"Araka ilay fanambarana, inona no tsy tohanan’ny USA Gymnastics taorian’ny fanararaotana atleta nataon’i Nassar?","The correct answer is **A: Fanafoanana ny fankatoavana**.

The statement explicitly says: ""Miombon-kevitra amin'ny fanambaran'ny USOC izahay fa ny tombotsoan’ny atletantsika sy ny vondrona, sy ny fanatanjahantenan’izy ireo, dia tsaratsara kokoa raha mandroso miaraka amin’ny fiovana manan-danja ao anatin’ny fikambanantsika, fa **tsy ny fanafoanana ny fankatoavana**.""
"
"Araka ilay fanambarana, inona no tanjona fototra iombonan’ny USA Gymnastics sy ny Kaomity Amerikanina misahana ny Lalao Olaimpika manomoka izao?","The correct answer is **D: Hampiroborobo tontolo azo antoka ho an’ny atleta**.

The passage explicitly states: ""The goal of USA Gymnastics and the USOC is the same – to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can perform their best in a secure, supportive, and empowering environment.""

While the other options are mentioned as *part* of the broader goals, they aren't the *fundamental, shared objective* in the same way that creating a safe environment is.
"
An-dalana ho aiza ilay sambo rehefa nitranga ilay loza? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palaoanina**.

The text states: ""Sambo mpiady Avenjera iray, an-dalana nankany Puerto Princesa any Palaoanina ilay sambo..."" which translates to ""An Avenger fighter jet, on its way to Puerto Princesa in Palawan...""
"
Iza no tsy zava-misy marina mahakasika ilay sambo voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra?,"The correct answer is **B: Mitoetra ao Palaoanina ilay izy**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sambo mpiady Avenjera iray tsy andairan’ny bala, an-dalana nankany Puerto Princesa any Palaoanina ilay sambo.""  This translates to: ""An Avenger fighter ship, impervious to bullets, was on its way to Puerto Princesa in Palawan."" The key is that the ship is *on its way* to Palawan, not *staying* there.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: An-dalana ho any Puerto Princesa ilay izy** (It was on its way to Puerto Princesa) - This is directly stated in the text.
*   **C: Sambo mpiady tsy andairan’ny bala ilay izy** (It was an impervious to bullets fighter ship) - This is also directly stated in the text.
*   **D: Nampiandraiketina ny andian-tsambo Amerikanina fahafito ilay izy** (It was part of the 7th American fleet) -  The text says ""Nampiandraiketina ny andian-tsambo Amerikanina fahafito ary mitoetra ao Sasebo, Nagasaki ao Japana izany."" This means it *is* part of the 7th American fleet and located in Sasebo, Nagasaki.

Therefore, the only untrue statement is that the ship is *staying* in Palawan. It's just passing through.
"
Iza no nanao an’ilay fanambarana momba ny tafika amerikana?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The question states that Donald Trump, through his new press secretary, made the announcement about the US military leaving Syria.
"
"Araka ilay fanambarana, firenena iza no nandray ny andraikitra hiambina an’ireo mpiady voasambotra?","The correct answer is **D: Torkia**.

The text states: ""...Torkia dia handray ihany koa ny fiambenana ireo mpiady ISIS voasambotra..."". This translates to ""...Turkey will also take on the responsibility of guarding the captured ISIS fighters..."".
"
Inona no eritreretina fa nahatonga an’ilay fianjerana?,"The correct answer is **B: Tifitra fanoherana**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nitranga teny ambony tany be tendrombohitra ilay fianjerana, ary **eritreretina ho vokatry ny tifitra fanoherana**."" (The crash happened in a mountainous area, and is **believed to be the result of enemy fire**.)
"
Tamin’ny tany manao ahoana no nitrangan’ilay fianjerana?,"The correct answer is **A: Misy fanoherana (There was resistance)**.

The text states: ""Nitranga teny ambony tany be tendrombohitra ilay fianjerana, ary eritreretina ho vokatry ny tifitra fanoherana."" (The crash happened in a mountainous area, and is suspected to be the result of enemy fire.)

While the other options are factors mentioned in the text (mountainous, difficult terrain, belonging to the coalition), the *cause* of the crash, according to the text, is enemy fire, which is a form of resistance.
"
Inona no antenain’ireo manampahefana vokatr’ilay tondradrano?,"The correct answer is **A: Fanarenana ireo antontam-pasika**.

The passage states: ""Na dia kely fotsiny aza ny fiakaran’ny rano aorian’ny tondradrano dia manantena ireo manampahefana fa ampy hanarenana ireo antontam-pasika kaoka manara-driaka izany."" (Even though the water level rises slightly after the dam, officials hope it will be enough to restore the suckermouth catfish.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Famoronana morontsiraka:** While the dam did create riverbanks, the question specifically asks about the *expected outcome* of the dam *after* the water level rises.
* **C: Fitomboan’ny isan’ny humpback chub:** The passage mentions humpback chub as a species of concern, but it doesn't state that the officials expect their population to increase.
* **D: Fonenan’ny bibidia bebe kokoa:**  While the dam created habitats for wildlife, the primary hope mentioned is for the restoration of the suckermouth catfish.



"
Nisy vokany maharitra tamin’iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto ny fanamboarana an’ilay tohodrano?,"The correct answer is **C: Fonenan’ny bibidia**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the dam's construction led to the recovery of two salmon species and the potential recovery of two others (including the humpback chub). This directly relates to the animal life (fonenan'ny bibidia) in the area.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Antontam-pasika (Salmon):** While the passage mentions salmon, the focus is on the *recovery* of the species, which is a result of improved habitat. The passage doesn't say the salmon themselves suffered long-term consequences.
* **B: Humpback chub:**  The passage mentions the humpback chub as a species *potentially* recovering, but it's more about the habitat improvements that could allow them to thrive, rather than a direct, lasting effect *on* the chub itself.
* **D: Fiparitahan’ny antsanga (Algae spread):** The passage states that the dam *prevented* the spread of algae, not that it had a lasting impact on algae spread itself.



Therefore, **C: Fonenan’ny bibidia (Animal life/Wildlife)** is the most comprehensive and accurate answer because it encompasses the overall positive impact on the ecosystem and the animals that depend on it."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no nanome tati-baovao an’i Etazonia momba ireo fanafihana mety hisy?","The correct answer is **C: Olona tsy notononina (Unnamed sources)**.

"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra marina ny fikasana fanafihana hataon’ireo ekstremista?,"The correct answer is **C: Hanapoaka baomba amin’ny toerana miavaka malaza ao amin’ny firenena roa.**

The text explicitly states the extremists are planning to bomb ""prominent tourist locations"" in both Kenya *and* Ethiopia. Therefore, option C accurately reflects this information.
"
Iza amin’ireto olona manaraka ireto no tsy mpisolo vava?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* **Petros Mantouvalos** was a Member of Parliament and a lawyer (implied by ""mpisolovava"" - lawyer/advocate).
* **Sakis Kechagioglou** and **George Nikolakopoulos** were defendants in the embezzlement case.
* **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is a journalist who reported on the scandal.  He is not listed as being involved in the legal proceedings as a lawyer.

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only one who is not a lawyer in this list.
"
Iza amin'ireo vondron’olona ireo no tsy voatonona ho tafiditra tamin'ilay tantara mamohehatra ao amin’ny vondrompiarahamonin’ny fitsarana grika?,"The correct answer is **A: Fampanoavana (Prosecutors)**.

The text explicitly mentions that the scandal involved "" ireo mpitsara sy mpisolo vava ary ny fampanoavana"" -  judges, prosecutors, and lawyers.  The question asks who *was not* mentioned, and prosecutors are the group missing from the list of those implicated in the scandal.
"
Firy ny wickets verin’i India?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The text explicitly states: ""very wickets 7 tamin’ny faran’ny lalao."" which translates to ""lost 7 wickets at the end of the game.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, firy ny isa ambony indrindra tamin’ireo fizaram-potoana?","The correct answer is **A: 70 hazakazaka**.

The text states: ""Hazakazaka 70 amin’ny baolina 41 tamin’ny fivelesana efatra 11 sy enina 2 izy."" which translates to ""He scored 70 runs off 41 balls in four innings 11 and six 2s.""  This clearly indicates that 70 is his highest score.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy anton’ny fahasorenan’i Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny politika vaovao an’ilay tranonkala mikasika ny votoaty ara-nofo**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what is *not* an explanation for Adam Cuerden's frustration.
* The text explicitly states that the frustration is *because* of Wales' actions (ignoring them and deleting the article) and not due to new content policies. 
* Options B, C, and D are all directly mentioned as reasons for the frustration. 

Therefore, option A is the correct answer because it's not mentioned as a cause of his frustration in the provided text.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no nofafana tamin’ilay tranonkala?","The correct answer is **B: Votoaty ara-nofo**.

The text states that the anger of the community led to efforts to write *policy regarding the content* (votoaty ara-nofo) for the website.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy tohanan’i Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **A: Fampidirana vehivavy mpiady amin’ny lalao olaimpika.**

The text states that Amir Khan believes women shouldn't fight, and that ""it's my view."" Therefore, he doesn't support the inclusion of women boxers in the Olympics. He *does* state he will support British athletes and London hosting the Olympics."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no hotohanan’i Amir Khan na dia eo aza ny heviny manokana?","The correct answer is **C: Ny lalao olaimpika 2012**.

The text states that Amir Khan said he would support the British competitors in the 2012 Olympics, *even though* he has his own views on women fighting. This indicates his support is for the event itself, not necessarily for female fighters.



"
Tamin’ny oviana i Peter Lenz no maty?,"The correct answer is **C: Tany amin’ny hopitaly**.

The text states: ""Tonga dia noraisin’ireo mpiasan’ny fahasalamana teny an-dalana izy ary nentina tany amin’ny hopitaly tao an-toerana izay nahafatesany taty aoriana kely."" (He was taken by paramedics to a local hospital where he died shortly after.)
"
Iza i Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Mpanao hazakazaka hafa**.

The text states that Xavier Zayat is Peter Lenz's racing competitor. Therefore, he is also a motorcycle racer.
"
Amin’ny toe-javatra manao ahoana ny mpandeha fiaramanidina matahotra iray no handray soa avy amin’ny fahafantarana ny fiasan’ny fiaramanidina?,"The best answer is **B: Raha toa ny tahony handeha fiaramanidina ka mihodina amin’ny tahotra mifototra amin’ny zavatra tsy fantatra.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the fear is often based on the unknown and lack of control.**  Knowing how an airplane works and what happens during a flight directly addresses this fear. Understanding the mechanics removes the mystery and empowers the passenger.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Raha toa ilay mpandeha fiaramanidina ka menatra noho ny amin’ny tahony:** While fear is present, the passage suggests understanding the flight *can* help overcome it.  Simply being scared isn't the key scenario.
* **C: Raha toa ilay mpandeha ka tsy tia ny karazana fitaterana rehetra:** This is a broader dislike of travel, not specific to air travel and the fear described in the passage.
* **D: Raha toa ny tahony ka avy amin’ny tranga niainany nandona ny sainy ary tsy mifandray amin’ny fandehanana fiaramanidina:** This is irrelevant. The fear is about flying itself, not a past trauma unrelated to it.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tokony hataon’ny mpandeha miraharaha vidy iray farany?","The correct answer is **C: Mampitaha vidy avy amin’ny orinasam-pitaterana maro.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Indraindry ny sidina iray dia mety hanana vidiny samy hafa be any amin’ireo masoivoho isan-karazany mpamory tolotra ary andoavam-bola ny fampitahana ny valim-pikarohana sy ny fijerena ny tranonkalan’ilay orinasam-pitaterana an'habakabaka mialohan’ny hamandrihana."" (Sometimes a single quote can have very different prices among various carriers, and it costs to compare the search results and check the carrier's website before booking.)

* **The implication is that comparison is key.**  The passage highlights the price variability and the cost of obtaining that information.  Therefore, a traveler should compare quotes from multiple carriers *before* booking.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mikaroka ny tolotry ny orinasam-pitaterana maro:** While researching quotes is important, the passage emphasizes the *comparison* of those quotes.
* **B: Mamandrika mivantana amin’ilay orinasam-pitaterana an'habakabaka:**  The passage suggests this is not ideal *before* comparing prices.  It's mentioned as something that might be done *after* seeing the price differences.
* **D: Mijery ny tranonkalan’ilay orinasam-pitaterana an'habakabaka:**  This is helpful, but the passage indicates it's one part of a larger process (comparison), not the sole or most crucial step.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tokony hataon’ny mpandeha voalohany mba hahazoana ny vidy tsara indrindra ho an’ny dia?","The correct answer is **B: Mampitaha vidy avy amin’ireo mpamory tolotra samihafa**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""Indraindray ny sidina iray dia mety hanana vidiny samy hafa be any amin’ireo masoivoho isan-karazany mpamory tolotra."" (Sometimes a single trip can have very different prices among various carriers).
* It also mentions the need to ""andoavam-bola ny fampitahana ny valim-pikarohana sy ny fijerena ny tranonkalan’ilay orinasam-pitaterana an'habakabaka mialohan’ny hamandrihana."" (and pay for the search results and checking the carrier's website before booking).

This strongly indicates that comparing prices from different carriers is the best way to get the best price.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

* **A: Mijery ny tranonkalan’ilay orinasam-pitaterana an'habakabaka:** While necessary, this alone doesn't guarantee the best price.
* **C: Mamandrika mivantana amin’ilay orinasam-pitaterana an’habakabaka:** This doesn't allow for price comparison.
* **D: Mamandrika mivantana amin’ny mpikarakara dia iray:** The passage doesn't mention a single arranger.



"
Rahoviana no mila mpitondra amin’ny fanaterana entana iray?,"The correct answer is **C: Rehefa alefa amin’ny maha entana voasoratra ilay izy.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Lalàn’ireo orinasam-pitanterana anabakabaka dia tsy mamela azy ireo handefa ny entana tsy misy mpitondra, ka eo no hidiranareo."" (The regulations of small shipping companies do not allow them to send goods without a carrier, and that's where you come in.) It further mentions ""Ny hany fomba haingana nahafahana nandefa ilay izy dia ny nampidirana azy ho entana voasoratra."" (The only fast way to send it was to include it as written cargo).

This means a carrier is required when the item is shipped as written cargo. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tokony hataonao laharam-pahamehana rehefa mifidy zotra an’habakabaka Mpandeha Matetika ao amin’ny firaisa-mpitatitra iray ianao?","The correct answer is **D: Ny orinasam-pitaterana an’habakabaka izay mety manome tombony fanampiny** (The carrier that offers additional benefits).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tokony ho tonga saina ianao fa matetika dia samy hafa ny tombony omena ary ny isa azon’ny mpandeha matetika amin'ny sidina dia mety ho betsaka kokoa any amin’ny sidina hafa samy ao anatin'ny firaisana iray ihany."" (You should be aware that the benefits offered are often different, and the number of points a frequent traveler earns on a route may be higher with other routes within the same alliance.)  This indicates that you shouldn't *only* focus on the airline you usually fly with, but consider which airline within the alliance offers the *best overall benefits*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ny orinasam-pitaterana an’habakabaka manome isa be indrindra** (The carrier that offers the most points). While points are important, the passage stresses *benefits* beyond just points.
* **B: Ny orinasam-pitaterana an’habakabaka ao amin’ny firaisa-mpitatitra lehibe indrindra** (The carrier in the largest alliance). The size of the alliance isn't the key factor.
* **C: Ny orinasam-pitaterana an’habakabaka fandehananao indrindra** (Your preferred carrier). The passage advises against solely focusing on your usual airline.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no mety manolotra isa azon’ny mpandeha matetika kokoa?","The correct answer is **A: Orinasam-pitaterana an’habakabaka iray hafa any amin’ny firaisa-mpitatitra hafa** (Another trucking company in a different carrier alliance).

The text explicitly states that ""the benefits offered and the number of trips often earned by frequent travelers may be higher with other carriers within the same carrier alliance.""  Therefore, it's other trucking companies *within* a different carrier alliance that are more likely to offer more trips.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto vavahadin-tsaina manaraka ireto no mety ho voa noho ny fisotroana toaka be loatra?","The correct answer is **A: Fahenoana (Blindness)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Laodivy tsy ara-dalàna dia mety misy loto samihafa mampidi-doza, tahaka ny methanol, izay mety hiteraka fahajambana na fahafatesana, na dia fatra kely aza.""  Methanol is known to cause blindness.

The other options are not mentioned in the text as consequences of excessive alcohol consumption.
"
"Araka ny voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mety hampihena ny fiantraikan’ny toaka manimba?","The correct answer is **C: Fisotroana alkôla am-pifehezana**.

Here's why:

* The text emphasizes the importance of knowing your limits regarding alcohol consumption.
* It states that the effects of alcohol vary from person to person, implying that moderation is key.
* It warns about the dangers of consuming illegal alcohol, especially because it might contain harmful substances like methanol.

Option C, ""Fisotroana alkôla am-pifehezana"" (Drinking alcohol in moderation), directly aligns with the text's message about understanding your limits and avoiding excessive consumption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fisotroana alkôla miaraka amin’ny methanol (Drinking alcohol with methanol):**  The text explicitly warns against this, as methanol is dangerous.
* **B: Fisotroana zava-pisotro mahamamo tsy ara-dalàna (Drinking illegal alcohol):**  The text also warns against this due to the potential presence of harmful substances.
* **D: Fisotroana miaraka amin’ny olona samihafa (Drinking with different people):** The text doesn't mention anything about the impact of drinking with different people.



"
Aiza ao Amsterdam no ambony indrindra ny lanjan’ny toerana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny Distrikan’ny Lakandrano (The Canal Ring)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...sy ny lanjan’ny toerany izay anisan’ny ambony indrindra eo amin’ny firenena."" (and its importance, which is among the highest in the country).  This importance is attributed to the Canal Ring (Ny Distrikan’ny Lakandrano).
"
Nahoana ny Distrikan’ny Lakandrano no natokan’i UNESCO ho Lova Iraisam-pirenena?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny soatoavina ara-tantara sy ara-kolotsaina (Its historical and cultural significance)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ny distrikta manontolo dia natokan’i UNESCO Lova Iraisam-pirenena **noho ny kolontsainy sy ny tantarany miavaka**..."" which directly translates to ""...the entire district was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site **because of its unique culture and history**...""

While options C and D are also true statements about the canal ring, option A is the reason given for the UNESCO designation. Option B is not mentioned in the text.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no mahatonga ny fitsidihana an’i Phnom Krom ho misy varany?","The correct answer is **A: Fahitana ny Tonle Sap**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ny rivotra manjombona ao amin’ny tempoly sy ny **fahitana ny farihy Tonle Sap avy ety ambony** dia mahatonga ny fihanihana ny havoana ho tsy anenenana."" (The refreshing breeze at the temple and the **viewing of the Tonle Sap lake from above** make the visit unforgettable.)
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no takina amin’ireo mpitsidika mba hahafahan’izy ireo miditra ao Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Fahazoana ny tapakila fidirana ao Angkor**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tapakila fidirana ao Angkor dia ilaina mba hidirana ny tempoly..."" which translates to ""An Angkor entrance ticket is required to enter the temple...""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no mety hisakana ny fitsidihan’ny mpizahatany ny Antarktika?","The correct answer is **D: Fihetsehana ara-batana voafetra (Limited physical fitness)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that visiting Antarctica requires a ""strong physical condition."" 
* Option D directly addresses this requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fandaniana be amin’ilay dia (High cost)** - While mentioned as a factor making trips expensive, it doesn't directly *prevent* visits.
* **B: Fahalianana hizaha ny Ranomasina Ross irery ihany (Desire to explore the Ross Sea alone)** -  The passage mentions the Ross Sea as an accessible area, but the desire to explore it alone doesn't hinder visits.
* **C: Fandaharan’asa mamela azy ireo hanao dia mandritra ny Desambra sy Janoary (A plan that allows them to do so during December and January)** - The passage specifies that the best time to visit is during Nov-Feb, and December/January falls within that timeframe. It doesn't state that visiting during other months is impossible.



"
Ny mpizahatany iray liana amin’ny fandehanana an-tendrombohitra dia afaka mitsidika faritra inona amin’ny Antarktika?,"The correct answer is **C: Ny Saikanosy**.

Here's why:

The passage states that tourist visits are limited to the **Saikanosy, Nosy sy ny Ranomasina Ross** (Ross Sea, Islands, and Ross Sea).  While the passage mentions Inland Antarctica and the possibility of scientists visiting the interior, it specifically says tourist visits are restricted to the coastal areas.  The question asks which areas a tourist can visit, and the passage explicitly lists the Saikanosy (Ross Sea) as one of them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ny Ranomasina Ross:** This is a part of the allowed areas, but the question asks for a specific area.
* **B: Ny faritra an-tanety (Inland Antarctica):**  The passage says tourist visits are *not* allowed inland, except for specialized expeditions.
* **D: Ireo Nosy (Islands):** The passage lists the Islands as an allowed area. 

Therefore, while C is correct the best answer would have been the combination of C and D."
Aiza ny toerana inoana fa tsy hahitana ivontoerana mpanaramaso talohan’ny fiainana maoderina indrindra?,"The correct answer is **A: Amin’ny toerana mora handehanana (In an easily accessible place)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that historical observatories are now often obsolete and serve as museums or educational centers. It also mentions that light pollution is a major problem that was less of an issue in the past, and observatories are now typically built in remote locations with good atmospheric conditions.

Therefore, the place *least* likely to have a historical observatory is one that is easily accessible, as they are now generally located in remote areas.  The other options (B, C, and D) are all places where you *might* find an observatory, even if modern ones are more commonly found in remote locations.
"
Aiza ny toerana mety hametrahana telesikaopy maoderina fanaovana fikarohana?,"The correct answer is **D: Ao amin’ny fotodrafitrasa goavana iray**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ny ankamaroan’ireo telesikaopy maoderina fanaovana fikarohana dia fotodrafitrasa goavana atao any amin’ny toerana lavitra izay tsara ny toetry ny sosondrivotra."" (Most modern research telescopes are built in remote locations with good atmospheric conditions).  This directly supports the idea that they are located in large facilities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ao amin’ny tranombakoka iray (In a building):** The passage contrasts modern telescopes with older ones housed in buildings. Modern telescopes are *not* typically in buildings.
* **B: Ao amin’ny toeram-pianaran’ny oniversite (In a university learning institution):** While universities *might* have smaller telescopes, the passage specifies *research* telescopes are in remote large facilities.
* **C: Ao toerana fanabeazana iray (In an educational institution):** Similar to universities, educational institutions might have smaller telescopes, but not the large research telescopes described.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, aiza ny faritra tsara indrindra ho an’ny fandehanana amin’ny moron-dranomasina mangina?","The correct answer is **C: Ny distrikan’i Harbour Avaratra**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Moron-dranomasina amin’ny moron-tsiraka avaratra (any amin’ny distrikan’I Harbour Avaratra) dia eo amin’ny ranomasim-be Pasifika ary mitohy any mianavaratra amin’i Long Bay sy mianatsimo amin’i Devonport."" This directly indicates that the Northern Harbour District has beaches ideal for swimming.  While St Heliers and Mission Bay are mentioned as popular, the *district* itself is the best answer based on the text.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, aiza no angambaina ho azo antoka indrindra ny toe-draharaha filomanosana?","The correct answer is **C: Afovoan’i Auckland**.

The text states: ""Azo antoka ny filomanosana"" (Swimming is definitely possible) and then mentions ""St Heliers any amin’ny afovoan’i Auckland"" (St Heliers in the central Auckland).  This indicates that St Heliers, located in central Auckland, is where swimming is most reliably possible, and therefore the safest bet.
"
"Rehefa mitsidika an’ilay toerana voasoritsoritra ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no heverina fa tsy mendrika?","The correct answer is **D: Mikiky foto-drafitr’asa**.

The prompt explicitly states: ""Aza tsiratsiraina ny toerana amin’ny fikikisana sy ny fanaovana soratsoratra amin’ny foto-drafitr’asa."" (Do not deface the site with graffiti and writing on the infrastructure.)

Therefore, option D is the action that is considered inappropriate and not respectful.
"
Iza amin’ireto no manoritsoritra ny fiteny lingua francas?,"The correct answer is **B: Voajanahary**.

The text states that lingua francas are ""fiteny voajanahary na organika"" (natural or organic languages) that become dominant due to various reasons facilitating communication between people of different native languages."
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana ireto no manoritsoritra marina ny fiteny fanampiny?,"The correct answer is **C: Izy ireo dia fiteny namboarina mba hanatsarana ny toe-javatra misy fifandraisana misy fahasahiranana.**

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Ireo fiteny fanampiny dia fiteny aritifisialy na namboarina sy noforonina mba hanamorana ny fifandraisan’ny mponina izay sahirana amin’ny fifandraisana raha tsy nisy izany."" (Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created to facilitate communication among people who have difficulty communicating if there were none.)
* **Option C directly reflects this:**  It accurately describes auxiliary languages as *namboarina* (constructed/modified) to *hanatsarana ny toe-javatra misy fifandraisana misy fahasahiranana* (improve situations with communication difficulties).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Izy ireo dia fiteny organika izay natao mba hanamorana ny fifandraisan’ny mponina izay mety tsy hifankahazo raha tsy nisy izany** (They are organic languages created to facilitate communication among people who might not understand each other if there were none.) -  This describes a lingua franca, not an auxiliary language. Auxiliary languages are *artificial*.
* **B: Izy ireo dia fiteny izay sady voajanahary no namboarina** (They are languages that are both international and constructed.) - While some auxiliary languages *aim* to be international, this isn't a defining characteristic. The primary focus is on them being constructed.
* **D: Izy ireo dia fiteny noforonina mahazo vahana eo amin’ny olona samy hafa fiteny** (They are languages created to gain popularity among people of different languages.) - This describes a language becoming widespread, not the purpose of an auxiliary language's creation. Auxiliary languages are created *specifically* to *facilitate* communication, not to gain popularity.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tokony hamarinin’ny mpandeha iray raha toa ka amin’ny andro ririnina ny dia an-tsambony?","The correct answer is **A: Toerana misy ny trano bongo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""Raha Raha mamakivaky ny Baltic Avaratra amin’ny andro ririnina dia aleo jerena ny toerana misy ny trano bongo..."".  This means that when traveling to the Northern Baltic in the fall, it's *best* to visit the locations with the belfries.

While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are not the primary recommendation for a fall trip to the Northern Baltic.  The text specifically highlights the belfry locations.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is A.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, raha toa ka amin’ny andro fahavaratra ny dia an-tsambon’ny mpandeha iray, inona no mety ho azony ialana?","The correct answer is **C: Fitakiana visa**.

Here's why:

The text states that train travelers to Northern Baltic in the winter *don't* need a visa. It doesn't mention anything about visa requirements during the summer. Therefore, if a traveler is going in the summer, they likely *would* need to consider visa requirements, which is the only option related to potential hurdles during the summer travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fotoana hijerena tanàna:** The text mentions this as part of the train journey, regardless of the season.
*   **B: Famakivakiana ranomandry:** This is specifically related to the winter activity of viewing the Northern Lights.
*   **D: Saint Petersburg:** Saint Petersburg is a destination on the train journey, mentioned as a place to see. It's not directly related to whether a visa is required in the summer.

Nahoana ny Katalano no ampiasaina matetika amin’ny famantarana sy filazana any Barselona?,"The correct answer is **B: Izy io no fiteny ofisialy voalohany tao amin’ilay tanàna**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Na dia izany aza, ny ankamaroan’ireo famantarana dia amin’ny teny Katalana ihany satria izy io no napetraky ny lalàna ho fiteny ofisialy voalohany."" (However, most signs are in Catalan only because it was established by law as the first official language.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Betsaka lavitra ny mahazo azy raha oharina amin’ny Espaniola** (Many people understand it compared to Spanish) - While true, this doesn't explain *why* it's used on signs.
* **C: Izy io no fiteny tian’ny olona kokoa any Barselona** (It's the language people in Barcelona like more) - The text doesn't indicate that it's a matter of preference.
* **D: Ny metro sy ny fotodrafitrasa ho an’ny daholobe hafa dia mponina miteny Katalano no mampiasa azy** (The metro and other public infrastructure are used by Catalan-speaking residents) - While Catalan speakers use the metro, this doesn't explain *why* the signs are in Catalan.
"
Iza amin’ireto fiteny manaraka ireto no ampiasaina amin’ny metro an’i Barselona ho an’ny filazana miverimberina?,"The correct answer is **A: Anglisy, D: Frantsay**.

The text states: ""...ny fikorontanana tsy ampoizina dia lazain’ny fitaovana mandeha ho azy amin’ny tenim-pirenena maro samihafa toy ny teny espaniola, teny anglisy, teny frantsay, teny arabo ary teny japoney."" (Translation: ""...the announcements are made automatically by the equipment in several languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese."")

Therefore, both English and French are used.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanajariana sy fampitaovana manaraka ireto no azo angambaina tsy hataon’ireo trano fandraisam-bahiny B&B raitra laharam-pahamehana?","The correct answer is **D: WiFi haingana be**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that the top two priorities for B&Bs are a good breakfast and comfortable bedding.  It mentions things like handmade quilts and seasonal, local food. While a charming atmosphere is mentioned (historic buildings, antique furniture), it's secondary to the core offerings.

WiFi is not mentioned at all as a priority or a desirable feature in the context of the text. Therefore, it is the least likely thing a B&B would prioritize based on what the text describes. The other options (seasonal food, antique furniture, and well-maintained grounds) align with the description of a high-end B&B focusing on a memorable experience.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy iray amin’ireo teboka lohalaharan’ny fifaninanana eo amin’ireo B&B mihaja?","The correct answer is **A: Haingon-trano maoderina (Modern quick service)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the two biggest differentiators for high-end B&Bs are **bedding** and **breakfast**. The text details luxury bedding (hand-woven blankets, featherbeds) and regional/signature breakfast. 

""Modern quick service"" is not mentioned as a characteristic of high-end B&Bs. The text focuses on traditional and luxurious aspects.  Option D (""Breakfast and local drinks"") is a reasonable paraphrase of the text's mention of regional cuisine in the breakfast.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy horaisin’i Beijing amin’ny 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Hetsika ski ao amin’ny faritra Taizicheng**.

The text states that Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies, and indoor aquatic events. It also mentions that ski events will be held in the Zhangjiakou area. However, it explicitly says Beijing *will* host the opening, closing, and indoor aquatic events; it does *not* say they will host the ski events in Zhangjiakou.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no horaisin’i Beijing amin’ny 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Lalao olaimpikan’ny ririnina**.

The text states: ""Ny tanànan’i Beijing ao Sina no hampiantrano ny Lalao Olaimpikan-dririnina amin’ny 2022..."" which translates to ""The city of Beijing in China will host the Winter Olympics in 2022...""

Iza no atahorana indrindra ho tratran’ny gripam-borona?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpandinika vorona**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ny ankamaroan’ireo dia nahakasika olona izay miasa miaraka amin’ny fiompiana akoho amam-borona, kanefa misy loza mitatao ihany koa ho an’ireo mpandinika vorona."" This translates to: ""The majority have affected people who work with bird breeders, but there is also a risk to birdwatchers.""

While the other options are mentioned, the text specifically highlights birdwatchers as being at risk *in addition* to those working with bird breeders.  Therefore, birdwatchers are one of the groups particularly at risk.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""mitsy loza mitatao ihany koa ho an’ireo mpandinika vorona."" (there is also a risk for birdwatchers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ireo olona miasa miaraka amin’ny fiompiana akoho amam-borona no tratran’ilay gripa:** While the text mentions this group, it doesn't say they are the *only* ones affected.
* **B: Betsaka kokoa ny tranga notaterina tamin’ny olombelona raha oharina amin’ny biby:** The text says ""Latsaky ny arivo ny tranga izany tsy mbola notaterina tamin’ny olombelona..."" (Less than a thousand cases have been reported in humans...). This contradicts the statement in option B.
* **D: Mahafaty daholo ny tranga notaterina tamin’ny olombelona:** The text states ""maro amin’izy ireo no mahafaty"" (many of them are fatal) but doesn't say *all* cases are fatal.

Inona no ampifandraisin’ny lakandranon’ny ranomasina fotsy-baltika?,"The correct answer is **C: Ranomasimbe Arktika sy ny ranomasina baltika**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lakandranon’ny ranomasina fotsy-baltika dia mampifandray ny ranomasimbe Arktika sy ny ranomasina baltika..."" which translates to ""The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea...""

(At some border crossings, vehicle checks are performed and you need to provide valid identification when entering one of these vehicles.) This directly indicates that identification checks happen during the vehicle journey.

Iza amin’ireto olana manaraka ireto no mety hitranga indrindra rehefa mipetraka any amin’ny faritra zanapehintany avo any Singapour?,"The correct answer is **C: Reraka noho ny hafanana**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Singapore experiences ""heat (humidity) and strong sunshine."" 
* The question asks about the *most likely* issue when living in a high-latitude area (which is incorrect, the passage says ""high-latitude"" but Singapore is tropical). The high heat and humidity are the most directly stated and likely challenges.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Misy manendaka (There are floods):** While Singapore can experience floods, the passage doesn't mention this as a primary concern related to its latitude.
* **B: Tsy fisian’ny tsena (There is no market):** The passage states that you can buy anything.
* **D: Very (Very cold):** This is the opposite of what the passage describes. Singapore is known for its warm, tropical climate.

Iza no mety hisafidy ny tsy hihinana mofomamy Alemana?,"The best answer is **A: Olona misy tsy fahazakan-tsakafo mahery, tsy mahazaka voa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the richness and richness of German pastries.** It specifically mentions they are fatty and come in many varieties, similar to Austrian pastries. It also lists ingredients like amygdalin, nougat, and other rich ingredients.
* **People with severe food allergies or those who are allergic to nuts would be unable to eat these pastries.** The passage mentions amygdalin (almond toxin) as an ingredient, which is a common allergen.
* **The other options are less directly related:**
    * **B: Olona tia kokoa ny tsindrin-tsakafo matavy:** The passage *describes* them as fatty, but doesn't say someone who prefers fatty foods wouldn't eat them.
    * **C: Olona tsy tia sokolà:** While some of these pastries *might* contain chocolate, the passage doesn't highlight chocolate as a key ingredient.
    * **D: Olona tia kokoa ny tsiro mamy noho ny tsiro masira:** The passage doesn't explicitly state the pastries are savory. It focuses on richness and a good pairing with strong coffee.



Therefore, allergy issues are the most direct and relevant reason someone might avoid German pastries based on the information provided.

Inona no heverina fa singa amin’ny vanintaona amin’ny mofomamy alemana?,"The correct answer is **A: Paoma**.

The text explicitly states: ""Betsaka koa ireo vokatra alemana nandrahoina tanaty lafaoro no ahitana amygdala, noazeta sy **voan-kazo hafa**. **Paoma** ihany koa no fanao mandritra ny taona."" (Many German products are also used for fillings, including amygdala, hazelnuts and other fruits. **Apples** are also a tradition during the year.)

While hazelnuts (noazeta) and amygdala are mentioned as fillings, apples (paoma) are specifically mentioned as a tradition *during the year*, implying a regular ingredient in the dough or filling.  Paiso is a fruit product *result* of the season, not necessarily a filling ingredient itself.

Therefore, **paoma (apples)** is the most accurate answer.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy torohevitra tsara omena ho an’ny dia amin’ny tetibola kely?","The correct answer is **C: Mangataka vola amin’ny olona (Asking people for money)**.

The text explicitly states that travelers should *not* ask for money for their own benefit. Options A, B, and D are all presented as acceptable (and even encouraged) within the framework of the travel tips described.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no mety ho sahirana raha manao dia amin’ny tetibola faran’izay kely?","The correct answer is **A: Olona vonona hiatrika fanamby (People willing to make sacrifices)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ho an’ireo izay vonona hanao sorona ny fahazoana aina, ny fotoana ary ny fahafantarana mialoha mba hahafahana manena ny fandaniana hanakaiky ny aotra, jereo ny tetibola kely indrindra fanaovana dia."" This translates to: ""For those willing to make sacrifices of life, time, and foreknowledge in order to achieve cheaper expenses, see the smallest little plan.""

Therefore, the people who would be willing to make sacrifices are the ones who would be able to benefit from the small plan.



Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Olona manana famerana hentitra amin’ny fotoanany (People with strict time management)** - While time management might be helpful, the text's focus is on sacrifice, not just efficient time use.
*   **C: Olona mieritreritra ny hiasa avy lavitra mandritra ny dia (People who think about working from afar during the trip)** - This is irrelevant to the topic of reducing travel expenses.
*   **D: Olona tia manaraka lalana voafaritra (People who like to follow defined rules)** - Following rules might be helpful, but the core concept revolves around sacrifice.



"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina tsara ny fandehanana eo amin’ny lalana eo anelanelan’i Point Marion sy Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **D: Tsy tokony ho olana ny serivisy an-telefaonina finday** (Cell service should not be a problem).

Here's why: The text explicitly states: ""Ny mahavariana anefa, ny tolotra amin’ny finday dia matanjaka kokoa aty nòho ny any amin’ny ampahan-dalana sasany, oh. ny Pennsylvania Wilds."" This means cell service *is* a good thing in certain parts of the road, not that it's not a problem.

Here's why the other options *are* accurate descriptions from the text:

*   **A: Misy ampahan-dalana lava izay lalana an-tanàna mitokana** (There are long sections that are rural roads) - The text mentions ""lalana tery sy ny fiolananamaranitra no manjaka"" (rural roads and winding roads prevail).
*   **B: Tery ireo sori-dalana** (The roads are winding) - The text explicitly states ""lalana tery sy ny fiolananamaranitra"" (winding roads).
*   **C: Tsy misy manaraka firy ny fetran’ny hafainganam-pandeha** (Speed limits are not followed at all) - The text states ""ny fanajana tanteraka azy ireny dia tena zava-dehibe tokoa"" (strictly observing them is very important), implying that people *don't* follow the speed limits.

Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the text.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto no tokony tena hampanahy ny mpitondra fiara mandeha amin’ny lalambe Buffalo-Pittsburgh?","The correct answer is **C: Mivily haingana loatra amin’ny fiolanana maranitra**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""If you are not used to driving in residential areas, **do not rush**: heavy traffic, sharp turns and **intersections are prevalent.** The posted speed limits are lower on the front and subsequent sections—often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and **strictly adhering to them is very important.**""

This emphasizes the danger of speeding and the importance of careful driving due to the sharp turns and intersections.  The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy takina mba hahafahana manomboka canyoning?,"The correct answer is **B: Toe-batana tsara indrindra**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: *""nefa tsy dia ilàna fiofanana firy na toe-batana matanjaka vao azo atomboka...""*  This means you don't *need* to have excellent physical fitness to start canyoning. While some fitness is helpful, it's not a requirement. The other options (swimming, climbing, and some training) are mentioned as activities *included* in canyoning, implying they are relevant to the activity.

Therefore, a strong physical condition is *not* a prerequisite to begin.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no mety ilaina mba hanaovana canyoning mahomby?,"The correct answer is **D: Fahaizana milomano (Abseiling)**.

Here's why:

* **Canyoning involves descending canyons using various techniques.**  A crucial technique in canyoning is abseiling (also known as rappelling), which is descending a vertical drop using a rope.  It's a core skill.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Fahaizana atletika avo lenta (High level of athletic ability):** While fitness helps, canyoning doesn't *require* high-level athleticism compared to activities like rock climbing or skiing.  It's more about adaptability and technique.
* **B: Traikefa fisitrihana ambany ranomasina teo aloha (Previous scuba diving experience):** Scuba diving experience isn't directly relevant to canyoning.  Canyoning focuses on land and water navigation, not underwater exploration.
* **C: Taratasy fanamarinana amin’ny canyoning (Canyoning certification):** While certification is *recommended* for safety and learning proper techniques, it's not always strictly *required* to start canyoning, especially for introductory trips with experienced guides.  Abseiling proficiency is generally a prerequisite.



Therefore, while other skills are helpful, **abseiling (fahaizana milomano)** is the most essential skill for safe and successful canyoning.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no afaka manampy ny olona mikasa ny hilasy ao anaty fiarany?","The correct answer is **B: Fiara misy seza azo ampandriana**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Azo atao ny milasy anaty fiara raha manana kamiao kely malalaka ianao, SUV, Sedan na Station Wagon misy seza azo ampandriana."" (You can fit inside your car if you have a small truck, SUV, Sedan, or Station Wagon with foldable seats.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fahatakarana tsara ny fetran’ny fiaranao** - While knowing your car's dimensions is helpful generally, the passage doesn't say it *helps* with fitting inside.
*   **C: Lay** - The passage mentions that installing a lock in a public place might attract unwanted attention, implying it's a negative, not a solution.
*   **D: Toerana misy tompony hilasiana** - This is irrelevant to the question of *how* to fit inside your own car.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mety ho tian’ny mpilasy halavirina raha toa izy ireo ka tsy te ho voamarika?","The correct answer is **A: Mitondra fiara lehibe kokoa toy ny SUV na kamiao kely**.

The passage states that using a smaller car for storage, especially in public places, can attract unwanted attention.  It then suggests that having a larger vehicle like an SUV, Sedan, or Station Wagon with folding seats is a good option. Therefore, the answer is A.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no nanarina an’i Casablanca fanindroany?","The correct answer is **D: Ny soltanan’i Maraoka**.

The text states: ""Ny soltana maraokanina no nanangana indray ny tanàna ho Daru l-Badya..."" which translates to ""The Moroccan Sultan re-established the city as Daru l-Badya...""
"
Iza no nandao ny tanàn’i Casablanca maoderina taorian’ny loza voajanahary iray?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny Portigey**.

The text states: ""Nopotehin’ny Portogey dia natsangany indray ary nomeny ny anarana hoe Casa Branca izy io, nefa dia navelany fotsiny teo taorian’ny horohorontany iray tamin’ny 1755."" This translates to: ""The Portuguese conquered it and rebuilt it, giving it the name Casa Branca, but they simply abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, ahoana no nahatonga an’i Sintra ho lasa nalaza teo amin’ireo vahiny?","The correct answer is **C: Ny fitantarana miabo nataon’i Lord Byron**.

The text states: ""...tanana mahafinaritra sy mahavariana amin’ny tanànan’i Sintra, tanàna lasa nalaza rehefa avy notatarain’i Lord Byron tamin’ny vahiny ny hakanton’ilay toerana.""  This directly translates to ""...a beautiful and stunning town in the area of Sintra, a town that became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron praised the place in his verses.""

Therefore, Lord Byron's verses are what made Sintra famous to foreigners.
"
Inona no tsy ankasitrahin’i Armenia?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny faritra Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Nagorno-Karabakh became Armenian-populated and a new republic formed *with Armenian support*. 
* However, *no country, including Armenia, officially recognizes this republic*. 
* Therefore, Armenia is essentially *in control of the territory but lacks official recognition*, which is a source of ongoing diplomatic tension with Azerbaijan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ny ady amin’ny Azeris:** The passage describes an initial war, but doesn't say Armenia *doesn't* want to fight Azerbaijan. The ongoing diplomatic talks imply a desire for resolution.
* **C: Tohan-kevitra diplomatikan’i Azerbaijan:**  The passage describes diplomatic talks, but doesn't indicate Armenia *doesn't* want them. The fact that talks are ongoing suggests otherwise.
* **D: Ilay repoblika vaovao:** While the republic isn't recognized, the passage implies Armenia *established* it with support, so it's not something Armenia is necessarily ""displeased with"" itself. The issue is its lack of international recognition.



"
Inona no mbola misy fiantraikany foana eo amin’ny fifandraisan’i Azerbaijan sy Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Faritra Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is the core issue preventing normal relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The formation of a self-declared republic within Nagorno-Karabakh and the lack of recognition are ongoing problems.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ireo Armeniana izay monina any Azerbaijan:** While the presence of Armenians in Azerbaijan is a factor, the conflict is fundamentally about the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, not just the presence of Armenians within Azerbaijan.
* **B: Ny ady tamin’ny 1994:** The 1994 war was *caused* by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. It's a symptom of the larger problem, not the enduring impact.
* **C: Tohan-kevitra diplomatika:** Diplomatic efforts are *intended* to resolve the conflict, but they haven't been successful. The fact that talks are ongoing doesn't mean the conflict is resolved or that it's not the main issue.



Therefore, the enduring impact on Azerbaijan-Armenia relations is the unresolved status of **Nagorno-Karabakh**.



"
"Rehefa mandray fiarakaretsaka any Charlotte, inona no mety hiteraka sarany fanampiny?","The correct answer is **B: Mpandeha miisa telo**.

The passage states: ""Efa maveatra ilay izy raha mitondra mpandeha mihoatra ny 2, mety ho lafo kokoa àry ity safidy ity."" This translates to: ""It becomes expensive to have more than 2 passengers, it might be more expensive."" 

Therefore, having more than two passengers is what could lead to extra charges.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no azo heverina ho lafy ratsin’ny hoe monina any Charlotte miaraka amin’ny ankizy?","The correct answer is **B: Mandray fiarakaretsaka**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ny fianakaviana any Charlotte dia tsy mampiasa fiara karetsaka amin’ny ankapobeny, azo ampiasaina ihany anefa amin’ny tranga sasany. Efa maveatra ilay izy raha mitondra mpandeha mihoatra ny 2, mety ho lafo kokoa àry ity safidy ity.""  This means that while families *can* use ride-sharing services, they aren't a primary mode of transportation and can become expensive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vidin’ny trano sy hofan-trano:** The text mentions quality housing options, implying it's a positive, not a negative.
* **C: Mponina avy amin’ny faritra hafa:**  The text says that people move to Charlotte due to strong community ties, implying this is a positive.
* **D: Miezaka ny ho tamana amin’ilay tanàna:** The text states that Charlotte is easy to navigate, especially with kids, indicating a positive.



"
"Talohan’ny nahatongavan’ireo Espaniola, iza no nifehy ny faritra avaratr’i Silia?","The correct answer is **D: Inca**.

The text states: ""Talohan’ny nahatongavan’ireo Espaniola tamin’ny taonjato faha 16, ny Inca no nitondra an’i Silia avaratra..."" which translates to ""Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the Inca ruled northern Chile...""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy nitranga tamin’ny 1810?","The correct answer is **B: Nandresy an’ireo Espaniola i Silia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na dia nanambara ny fahaleovan-tenany aza ny Silia ny 1810..."" (Even though Chile declared its independence in 1810...).  It goes on to explain the context of that declaration (the Napoleonic Wars).  It **does not** mention Chile defeating the Spanish.

Let's look at why the other options *did* happen in 1810 according to the text:

*   **A: Tsy nisy governemanta niasa** - ""nandritry ny roa taona"" refers to the period of Napoleonic Wars, which impacted Spain's government.
*   **C: Nisy ady tamin’ny andron’i Napoleona** - This is explicitly stated as the reason for the disruption in Spain.
*   **D: Nanambara ny fahaleovan-tenany i Silia** - The text clearly says Chile declared independence in 1810.

Therefore, the only option that *didn't* occur in 1810, based on the provided text, is B.
"
Ahoana no azon’ny olona atao mba hahatongavana any amin’ireo tanàna kely mitokana any amin’ny faritr’i Liguria?,"The correct answer is **B: Amin’ny alalan’ny fiara na lamasinina**.

The text states: ""Lalana,lamasinina ary sambo no mampifandray ireo tanana kely..."" This translates to ""Roads, walkways and boats connect the small towns..."" So, people can get around by car and by boat.
"
Inona no dikan’ilay teny italiana hoe ‘Cinq Terre’?,"The correct answer is **A: Tanàna kely dimy**.

The text states: ""P: Cinq Terre, izay midika hoe Tany Dimy..."" and then goes on to list five towns. The phrase ""Tany Dimy"" translates to ""Five Lands"" or ""Five Towns"". Option A, ""Tanàna kely dimy"" which means ""Five small towns"", is the closest and most accurate translation.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona ny karazana baoty mety tsara rehefa ilay malama amin’ny ririnina iny?","The correct answer is **B: Baoty misy haingony mampiraikitra**.

The text specifically mentions ""Baoty sasany dia misy haingony mampiraikitra ary misy fitaovana fanampiny misy haingony mampiraikitra natao ho an’ny toerana malama..."" which translates to ""Some bottles have quick-clamping and there are additional quick-clamping devices made for rough areas..."".  This directly addresses the question of suitable bottle types for rough winter conditions.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy hanamora ny vahana amin’ny lalana malama rehefa ilay malama amin’ny ririnina iny?,"The correct answer is **D: Rano**.

Here's why:

The text states that salt (chlorure de calcium) is often spread on icy roads to make it easier to drive.  Sand, small stones, and gravel are also used for traction.  

**Water** would actually make the ice *worse* by creating a slippery layer. The other options (salt, stones, gravel) all help improve grip.

Therefore, water is the one option that *would not* make the ice easier to navigate.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no fitoviana marina eo amin’i Hawaii sy ny Nosy Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Mitovy ny ora any amin’izy ireo.**

The text states: ""Mitovy amin’ny ora any Hawaii, ary indraindray dia noheverina fa “ambanin’ny Hawaii” no misy an’ilay nosy."" This directly indicates that the time zones are the same.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Samy misy hôtely lehibe any amin’izy ireo** - The text mentions that Cook Islands are smaller and remind some visitors of Hawaii *before* the development of large hotels. This implies Cook Islands *don't* have large hotels yet.
* **B: Samy tsy manana fanjakana izy ireo** - The text states that Cook Islands are part of a free association with New Zealand, which does involve governance.
* **D: Samy tsy misy tanàna izy ireo** - The text says that the Cook Islands are made up of 15 different islands, not that there are no towns.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina ny Nosy Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Ireo tanàna lehibe indrindra dia Rarotonga sy Aitotaky**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Ny Nosy Cook dia **tsy misy tanàna akory** fa voarafitra nosy 15 samihafa."" (The Cook Islands have **no cities** but are made up of 15 separate islands.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Kely kokoa noho i Hawaii izy io** - The text says it's sometimes called ""underneath Hawaii"" and is smaller than Hawaii.
*   **B: Vondronosy izy io** - The text states it's a group of 15 islands.
*   **D: Mitovy amin’ny ora any Hawaii ny oran’io nosy firenena io** - The text says it shares the same time zone as Hawaii.



Therefore, option C contradicts the information given in the text."
Iza amin’ireto tobin'ny mpiambina valanjavaboary ireto no manolotra safidy fampiantranoana roa?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sirena no tobin'ny mpiambina valanjavaboary hany misy fatoriana sy sakafo mafana ankoatra ny fitobiana."" (Sirena is the only ranger station that offers lodging and hot food in addition to camping.)

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, aiza ianao no afaka mamandrika fahazoandàlana raha toa ianao ka te hampiasa vola fa tsy kara-bola?","The correct answer is **C: CafeNet El Sol**.

CafeNet El Sol dia manome tolotra famandrihana amin’ny vidiny $30 amerikana, na $10 ho an’ny andro iray; fanazavana eo amin’ny pejin’izy ireo Corcovado.""

This means CafeNet El Sol offers a way to obtain the permit for a fee.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, karazana fanaovana ski inona no atao amin’ny tany misy hantsana?","The correct answer is **B: Backcountry ski**.

The text states: ""...io farany io atao amin’ny tany misy hantsana ary mila ski sy kiraro mafy kokoa."" This translates to ""...the latter is done on snowy terrain and requires stronger skis and bindings."" This directly refers to backcountry skiing.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mety hanampy ny mpanao ski backcountry izay te hahatratra hafainganam-pandeha ambony kokoa?","The correct answer is **C: Toetr’andro tsara**.

The text states: ""Reritrereto ho mitovy amin’ny làlana dia an-tongotra ny làlana manao ski. Fa raha tsara ny toetr’andro, dia mety hahahavita làlana betsaka kokoa noho ny hoe mandeha tongotra ianao - fa indraindray ihany no mety ahazoanao ny fahafainganana amin’ny cross country skiing raha tsy misy kitapo mavesatra amin’ny dian-dàlana efa mahazatra.""

This means that good weather conditions can allow for higher speeds in cross-country skiing, even without heavy bindings. The other options are incorrect according to the passage.
"
Inona no sarotra amin’ireo mpandehandeha misy fahatairana amin'ny fiverenana indray an-tanindrazana ny manao azy?,"The correct answer is **D: Mizatra indray ny kolontsain’ny toerana niavianao (Rehefa avy nipetraka tany ivelany ka miverina mody any amin’ny tany niavianao, dia efa lasa zatra an’ilay kolotsaina vaovao ianao ka hadinonao ny sasany amin’ny kolontsaina tamin’ny toerana niavianao.)**

Here's why:

* The paragraph explicitly states: ""Rehefa avy nipetraka tany ivelany ianao ka miverina mody any amin’ny tany niavianao, dia efa lasa zatra an’ilay kolotsaina vaovao ianao ka hadinonao ny sasany amin’ny kolontsaina tamin’ny toerana niavianao."" This means the difficulty is readjusting to the customs of their homeland after becoming accustomed to a new culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mizatra ny kolontsain’ny toerana vaovao iray:** While adjusting to a new culture is *part* of the experience, the question focuses on the difficulty *of returning* to the homeland.
* **B: Mahandry sy mahazo ny hafa:**  This relates to the initial experience of being a foreigner, not the difficulty of returning.
* **C: Manao dia any ivelany:** This is simply a statement of fact about the experience of being abroad, not the core difficulty of returning.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, ho an’ny mpandehandeha hoatran’ny ahoana no tena mety ho sarotra ny fahatairana amin'ny fiverenana indray an-tanindrazana?","The correct answer is **A: Mpandehandeha niaina fahatairana amin'ny kolontsaina tena ratsy**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that culture shock during repatriation can be **more severe, longer-lasting, and potentially stronger** than initial culture shock when traveling to a new place.
* It also mentions that people who have lived abroad often struggle with reintegrating into their homeland's culture. 
* This suggests a difficult, or ""bad,"" experience of culture shock upon returning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mpandehandeha vetivety dia zatra rehefa nipetraka tany ivelany:** The passage states the opposite; they often struggle to readjust.
* **C: Mpandehandeha mbola ao anatin’ilay dingana volantantely:** The passage focuses on the *repatriation* (returning home), not the initial experience of traveling abroad.
* **D: Mpandehandeha tsy mahandry:** While the passage mentions the need for patience and understanding, it doesn't directly state that returning travelers are ""unpatient.""
"
Iza amin’ireo manaraka ireto no tsy tokony hataon’ny olona amin’ny élan?,"The correct answer is **B: Manakaiky azy miadana loatra (Approach it too closely)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while elk aren't inherently aggressive, they will defend themselves if they feel threatened. It specifically warns that if people don't signal they're not a threat, they might get too close and provoke an attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsy miraharaha ny fisiany (Don't make sudden movements)** - This is generally good advice when encountering any wild animal, including elk.
* **C: Manamaivana ny maha mampidi-doza azy (Make yourself seem non-threatening)** - This is crucial.  The passage emphasizes not signaling danger.
* **D: Mijery azy avy lavitra (Watch it from a distance)** -  This is a good safety precaution.

Therefore, the most direct instruction *not* to do is to approach too closely, especially without signaling you're not a threat.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ny élan ireto no tsy marina?","The correct answer is **A: Biby efa masiaka mihitsy izy ireo** (They are already a truly docile animal).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ny élan (fantatra ihany koa hoe wapiti) dia tsy tena hoe masiaka..."" (The elan (also known as wapiti) is not truly docile...).  This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: Matetika izy ireo no tsy hitan’ny olona hoe mampidi-doza** (They are often not considered dangerous by people): The text says, ""Rehefa tsy hitan’ny olona hoe mampidi-doza ny serfa..."" (When people don't consider the elk dangerous...).
* **C: Mety ho lasa hasiaka izy ireo raha misy olona manakaiky azy loatra** (They can become dangerous if people get too close): The text states, ""...mety hanakaiky be loatra ka hampidi-doza ny tenany."" (...they may get too close and defend themselves.)
* **D: Hiaro ny tenany izy ireo raha toa ka ilaina izany** (They will defend themselves if necessary): The text says, ""raha mahatsapa fandrahonana izy dia hiaro ny tenany."" (if they feel threatened, they will defend themselves).



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy hampidi-doza indrindra ho an’ny mpandeha any amin’ny tany efitra?","The correct answer is **A: Tsy fahampian’ny akanjo mafana amin’ny alina mangatsiaka** (Not having warm clothes at night).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that hypothermia is a serious danger if you don't wear warm clothes at night.
* Options B, C, and D all describe situations that directly deplete resources (energy, water) or create hazards (the mirage) for the traveler. 
* While all the scenarios are dangerous, the text emphasizes the *hypothermia* risk related to lack of warm clothing. Therefore, the lack of warm clothing is the *most* directly and explicitly linked to a potentially dangerous situation mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy voalaza fa mety hampidi-doza ho an’ny mpandeha any amin’ny tany efitra?,"The correct answer is **A: Tsy fahampian’ny rano (Lack of water)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically links heatstroke and the mirage-like visions to dehydration and energy loss.** It says that ""manenjika ilay taratra fahitana ilay mpandeha, mandany ny hery izay sarobidy sy ny rano sisa tavela"" (chasing the mirage expends vital energy and the remaining water).
* **The passage explicitly mentions hypothermia as a danger from cold nights.**
* **The passage doesn't mention lack of water as a direct danger to hikers experiencing heatstroke.** While dehydration is a problem, the passage focuses on the *effect* of chasing mirages on hydration, not just a general lack of water.
* **""May noho ny tara-masoandro"" (Sunburn)** is a possible hazard, related to the heat, and is implied but not directly addressed as a danger.

Therefore, lack of water is the option that is *not* mentioned as a direct hazard related to the conditions described in the passage.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, nisy fiantraikany be tamin’ny mponina iza ny fahatongavan’ireo mpamaky lay?","The correct answer is **C: Ny Taínos**.

The text states: ""Ny Caribes dia olona miteny Arawakan izay tonga 10 000 taona talohan’ny Kristy. Taona vitsy monja taorian’ny nahitana fihetsiketina eoropeana no nahitana fihenana be ny mponin’i Tainos noho ny mpanafika espaniola."" (The Caribes are Arawakan-speaking people who arrived 10,000 years before Christ. Just a few years after the European arrival, there was a large decrease in the population of the Taínos due to the Spanish invaders.)

Therefore, the arrival of the Spanish had a significant impact on the Taínos population. The other options are incorrect because the text does not mention Haitians, Caribes having a significant impact from the arrival of the Europeans, or the Spanish themselves having a major impact on the population.

Iza no azo lazaina fa nahatonga ny fanaovana ski ho fialamboly halaza?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpirenirenin’ny ski (Ski touring)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""The ski is a major recreational activity, known sometimes as 'ski touring,' which organizes a complete holiday around skiing in a designated area.""

Therefore, ""ski touring"" (mpirenirenin’ny ski) is the activity that made skiing a popular pastime. The other options are related but not the primary reason for its popularity.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, tamin’ny oviana tany ho any ny fanaovana ski no voalohany noraisina ho fanatanjahantena?","The correct answer is **D: Taonjato faha-17**.

The text states: ""Ny ski dia hetsika fitsangatsanganana iray lehibe be mpankafy, fantatra amin’ny anarana hoe “mpirenirenin’ny ski” indraindrainz, mandamina fialan-tsasatra iray manontolo manodidina ny ski any amina toerana iray voatokana. Efa ela be ny eritreritra hisosa an-dranomandry - ny hosodoko anaty lavabato mampiseho olona misosa an-dranomandry dia efa tany amin’ny taona 5000 t.K. tany ! Ny fisosana midina an-tendrombohitra amin’ny maha fanatanjahantena azy dia efa tany amin’ny taonjato faha-17 tany fara-fahakeliny...""

This indicates that downhill skiing as a sport was first taken up in the 17th century.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no ahafantarana matetika ny nosy lehibe indrindra manila ny morontsiraka atsinanan’i Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Bibidia**.

The passage states: ""Madagasikara no lehibe indrindra hatreto, ary tanibe iray mihitsy raha resaka bibidia."" This directly indicates that Madagascar is known for its wildlife.
"
Inona no tsy toetoetran’ireo Nosin’ny Afrika Atsinanana kely kokoa? ,"The correct answer is **A: Fifandraisana amin’i Frantsa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ny ankamaroan’ireo nosy kely dia firenena tsy miankina na misy ifandraisany amin’i Frantsa..."" This means many of the smaller islands *do* have a connection to France.

The other options are true statements about the islands as described in the text:

*   **B: Toeram-pialantsasatra mihaja maro:** The text says they are ""fantatra ho toy ny toeram-pialantsasatra amorontsiraka mihaja.""
*   **C: Fanta-daza ho misy bibidia:** The text says ""Madagasikara no lehibe indrindra hatreto, ary tanibe iray mihitsy raha resaka bibidia.""
*   **D: Tsy miankina amin’ny firenena hafa:** The text says they are ""tsy miankina na misy ifandraisany amin’i Frantsa"" - meaning they aren't independent *or* have ties to other nations.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* mentioned as a characteristic of the smaller islands is their connection to France.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, ahoana no hankalazana ny Paska any amin’ny fiangonana tena nentim-paharazana sasany?","The correct answer is **B: Manao alimbavaka ny Sabotsy alina**.

The text states: ""Matetika dia manao alimbavaka ireo fiangonana nentim-paharazana ny Sabotsy alina anatin’ny faran’ny herinandron’ny Paska..."" (Often, old-fashioned congregations say prayers on Holy Saturday in the late afternoon...).

While the other options might be related to Easter traditions generally, the text specifically mentions prayer on Holy Saturday.
"
"Mba hialana amin’ny fitakiana rehefa miditra an’i Ekoatora, inona aloha no tokony hananan’ny mponina Kiobana voalohany?","The correct answer is **B: Taratasy fanasàna voamarina ara-dalàna**.

The text explicitly states: ""Takian’i Ekoatora ny hahazoan’ny mponina Kiobana taratasy fanasàna mialoha ny hidirany an’i Ekoatora..."" (Ecuador requires Cuban residents to obtain a visa in advance before entering Ecuador...).

While the other options are also requirements, the visa is the *first* and most fundamental requirement mentioned to avoid issues.
"
Tsy natao mba hanaovana inona ny fitakian’i Ekoatora momba ny fanaovan-dia?,"The correct answer is **A: Mba ho faran’ny ambany ny isan’ny mpandeha (To limit the number of travelers)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the requirements are in place ""to ensure peaceful migration between the countries of origin."" This suggests a desire to manage the flow of people.
* While options B and C are elements of the requirements, the primary motivation is to regulate the number of travelers.
* Option D (Ensuring passport validity) is a specific requirement mentioned in the text, not the overall goal of the visa process.

Therefore, the most encompassing reason for the Ecuadorian visa requirements is to limit the number of travelers entering the country.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no mety ho lafo kokoa any amin’ny firenena vahiny raha oharina amin’ny any an-tanàna?,"The correct answer is **B: Monture an’ny marika avo lenta (Frames of high-end brands)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: "" ireo tena izy dia lafo noho ny any an-tanàna"" which translates to ""the real ones are expensive than in the city.""  This directly refers to high-end brand frames.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fitiliana maso (Eye exam):** The passage doesn't mention whether eye exams are more or less expensive in foreign countries.
* **C: Fiantohana mahakasika ny maso (Eye insurance):**  Similar to eye exams, the passage doesn't provide information on the cost of eye insurance abroad.
* **D: Monture tsy misy marika (Unbranded frames):** The passage suggests that unbranded frames might be cheaper, but doesn't claim they are *more* expensive in foreign countries than in the city.



"
Inona no mety hatahorana amin’ny fividianana monture an’ny marika avo lenta any amin’ny firenena vahiny?,"The best answer is **C: Mety ho hosoka izy ireny (They might be counterfeit).**

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly mentions that some high-end brands are counterfeit in foreign countries.** This is directly stated as a problem.
* **Option C directly addresses this problem.**
* Let's look at why the other options are less likely:
    * **A: Mety ilaina ny fitiliana maso fanampiny (Additional eye exam might be needed):** While possible, it's not a direct consequence of buying a high-end brand in a foreign country.
    * **B: Mety tsy hety amin’ny monture sasany ny taratasim-panafody (The passport might not be accepted with some montures):** This is less likely to be a general issue and more specific to certain regulations.
    * **D: Mety tsy voasahan’ny fiantohana ny vidiny (They might not be covered by price guarantee):** While price guarantees can vary, it's not the core issue related to the country of purchase and counterfeit goods.

Therefore, the most directly related and likely consequence of buying a high-end brand in a foreign country (as described in the prompt) is that **they might be counterfeit.**



"
"Mahakasika ny fampiasana vola any Falkland, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no marina?","The correct answer is **D: Ankoatra ny Falkland pound, dia ny vola anglisy livre sterling no vola ekena matetika.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ekena na aiza na aiza ao amin'ireo nosy ny livre sterling amin'ny ankapobeny..."" (The pound sterling is generally accepted throughout the islands...)
* **It also states:** ""...ao anatin'i Stanley dia ekena ihany koa ny kara-bola sy ny dolara amerikanina matetika."" (...in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ny karatra fitrosana sy ny vola anglisy livre sterling ihany no ekena eny amin’ireo nosy lavitra** - The text says credit cards *may not* be accepted on remote islands, and US dollars *may* be accepted.
* **B: Any Stanley ihany no toerana manaiky ny dolara amerikanina** - The text says US dollars are accepted *frequently* in Stanley, but it doesn't exclude other locations.
* **C: Ny Falkland pound dia tokony hatakalo rehefa avy miala an’ireo nosy** - The text says it's *difficult* to exchange Falkland pounds outside the islands, but it doesn't say you *must* exchange it upon leaving.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, rehefa mandeha any amin’ny Tangoronosy Maloina avy any Etazonia, aiza ny fomba fandoavam-bola hafa ankoatra ny kara-bola fahanana no mety ho tena ilaina?","The correct answer is **A: Ao amin’ny tranombarotra FIC West**.

The text states: ""Azo atakalo ao amin’ny banky tokana ao amin’ireo nosy ny vola, izay ao Stanley ampitan’ny tranombarotra FIC West."" (Money can be withdrawn from a single bank on the islands, located within Stanley at the FIC West shop.)  This implies FIC West is a key location for accessing the official currency.

While the text mentions other places where currency is accepted, it specifically highlights FIC West as a place where you can withdraw money. Therefore, it's the most relevant answer to the question.
"
Inona ny hetsika tsy misy ifandraisany amin’ny fankalazana an’ireo fetiben’ny tempoly?,"The correct answer is **A: Fahaterahan’ny elefanta iray**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that temple festivals are celebrated *within* the temple's annual cycle, the deity's anniversary, or other significant events *affecting* the temple. A birth of an elephant, while perhaps an auspicious event, isn't directly mentioned as being *part* of the established festival cycle or related to the temple's specific celebrations. The other options (B, C, and D) *are* mentioned as being related to the festivals.
"
Aiza no ahitana elefanta voahaingo?,"The correct answer is **C: Amin’ireo filaharana amin’ny fetiben’ny tempoly**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ny fetin’ny tempolin’i Kerala dia tena mahaliana ny mijery azy, miaraka amin’ny filaharan’elefanta voahaingo..."" (The festival of the Kerala temple is very interesting to see, with the procession of elephants...).  This directly links the elephants to the festival processions within the temple.
* Option A is too general and doesn't specify *where* the elephants are seen.
* Option B is too broad; elephants aren't *always* found in temples.
* Option D is incorrect and not supported by the text.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tena inoana fa mitsitsy vola amin’ny saran-tsidina kilasy voalohany na business?","The correct answer is **A: Mandoa azy amin’ny alalan’ny orinasanao**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ny fomba mivantana indrindra handehanana amin’ny sokajy voalohany na fandrarahana dia ny fandoavana vola matevim-be ho an’izany tombotsoa izany (na tsaratsara kokoa, ny orinasanao no asainao manao izany ho anao).""

This directly indicates that the company paying for the first-class or business class ticket is the preferred method.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mamandrika sokajy voalohany fa tsy fandrarahana:** The text doesn't mention requesting first class but not booking a ticket.
* **C: Mamandrika sidina sokajy voalohany tsy mivantana:**  The text explicitly talks about direct (live) flights.
* **D: Mitady fihenam-bidy:** The text says that seeking discounts isn't the focus, as some travelers are willing to pay a premium.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no fandaniam-potoana fotsiny ny mitady azy rehefa mamandrika kilasin’ny saran-tsidiny sasany?","The answer is **C: Fihenam-bidy**.

The text explicitly states: ""Fantatry ny sidina fa misy vondron’ny mpandeha izay vonona handoa dolara ambonimbony mba hahazoana tombotsoa amin’ny fandehanana amin’ny toerana iray haingana, mahazo aina tsara ary ny vidiny mifanaraka amin’izay. **Tsy ilaina ny fitadiavana fihenam-bidy** amin’ny seza bizinesy na kilasy voalohany amin’ny sidina mivantana A mankany amin’ny B."" 

Therefore, the question is about the time spent *looking for* discounts (fihenam-bidy) when enrolling in certain online classes. The text says it's unnecessary.



"
Inona no tsy mila ampiana rehefa mampitaha ny tontalin’ny tomban’ny saran-dianao any Afrika amin’ny saran-dia maneran-tany?,"The correct answer is **C: Vidin’ny visa afrikana**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Aza adino ny manampy ny saran’ny visa fanampiny, ny hetra eny am-piaingana, ny fitaterana an-tanety, sns. ho an’ireo toerana rehetra ivelan’i Afrika ireo.""  This means visa fees *within* Africa are not mentioned as needing to be added to the comparison with international travel costs.  Option C, visa fees *within* Africa, is therefore the correct answer.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, manomboka manome safidy bebe kokoa amin’ny inona izao ny tranom-barotra lehibe?","The correct answer is **C: Toeram-pisakafoana eo an-toerana**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ny sasany aza dia mampiasa ireny lafaoro micro-onde ireny na koa fomba hafa mba hamanana ny sakafo. **Toeram-pisakafoana iray** eo an-toerana, matetika dia toeram-pisakafoanana iray tsy manara-penitra amin’ny vidiny mirary.""

This indicates that the presence of food outlets *within* the stores increases the variety of food options available to customers. While microwaves and cheap prices can contribute, the text specifically highlights the on-site food outlets as a key factor in providing more choices.



"
Inona amin’ny tolotra ataon’ny toerampivarotana lehibe sasany no mety hahaliana ny mpanjifa mividy safako efa vonona ny hohanina?,"The correct answer is **A: Toeram-pisakafoana eo an-toerana**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a major drawback for those who can't cook is limited options to eat prepared food.  Having a food court *within* the supermarket offers a solution to this problem, giving them a readily available meal option.  The other options are presented as *negative* aspects, not solutions.

*   **B: Safidy vitsy kokoa** - This is the opposite of what a food court provides.
*   **C: Sakafo manta** - The passage emphasizes prepared food.
*   **D: Lafaoro micro-onde** - While helpful, this doesn't directly address the issue of having a ready-made meal *available* at the store. A food court offers an immediate solution.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no mety tsy ho azon’ny Belga sy Soisy miteny Frantsay?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny ankamaroan’ny teny frantsay resahana any Frantsa** (Most of the French words spoken in France).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that while the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is mutually intelligible with French spoken in France, there are differences.
* These differences include distinct counting methods, unique vocabulary, and variations in pronunciation.
* Option D refers to ""most"" of the French words spoken in France.  Since there are differences in vocabulary, it's likely that a significant portion of the words used in France wouldn't be the *most* familiar or commonly used by Belga and Swiss French speakers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ny fomba fanisa frantsay iraisana** (The common French counting method): The passage says they *do* learn the standard French counting method in school.
* **B: Teny frantsay miavaka** (Distinct French words): The passage directly mentions that they use distinct vocabulary.
* **C: Fanonona teny frantsay sasany** (Pronunciation of some French words): The passage explicitly mentions variations in pronunciation.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto any Belzika sy Soisa no tsy mitovy amin’ny any Frantsa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny fanonona ny teny rehetra (The pronunciation of all words)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the pronunciation of some words differs in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France. Options B, C, and D are all mentioned as areas of similarity or commonality.

Therefore, the only option that highlights a difference is the pronunciation.
"
Amin’ny tranga inona ianao no inoana fa tsy hotolorana saran-dalam-pisaonana?,"The correct answer is **C: Raha toa ianao ka mandeha amin’ny sidina Lufthansa avy ao Paris mankany Etazonia.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that Orinasam-pitaterana an’habakabaka offer last-minute deals on baggage fees for flights *from the US or Canada*.
* Lufthansa is mentioned as an airline offering this deal *from the US or Canada*.
* Option C describes a Lufthansa flight *from Paris*.  Since Paris is not in the US or Canada, the last-minute baggage deal likely wouldn't apply.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Raha toa ianao ka mandeha amin’ny sidina WestJet:** The passage *does* list WestJet as an airline offering these deals.
* **B: Raha toa ianao ka mamandrika mivantana amin’ny orinasam-pitaterana an’habakabaka fa tsy amin’ny serivisy antoko fahatelo:** The passage explicitly states that you *must* book directly with the airline to get this deal. This is true regardless of whether you're using their website or a third-party service.
* **D: Raha toa ianao ka mandeha amin’ny sidina Delta:** The passage *does* list Delta Air Lines as an airline offering these deals.



"
Inona amin’ireto no marina raha ny momba ny saran-dalam-pisaonana?,"The correct answer is **C: Misahana ny vidin’ny dia amin’ny minitra farany**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Orinasam-pitaterana an’habakabaka vitsy sisa no mbola manolotra saran-dalam-pisaonana, izay mampihena kely ny vidin’ny dia amin’ny fandevenana amin’ny minitra farany."" (A few airlines still offer last-minute fare sales, which slightly reduce the price of the ticket when booking at the last minute.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Misahana ny vidin’ny dia amin’ny fandevenana izy io** - While true, this is too general. The text focuses specifically on *last-minute* fares.
* **B: Tsy maintsy fandrihana mivantana amin’ny tranonkalan’ilay orinasam-pitaterana an’habakabaka izy io** -  The text says you need to book *directly on the airline's mobile app*, not necessarily on their website.
* **D: Tsy maintsy fandrihana amin’ny finday mivantana any amin’ny orinasam-pitaterana** - This is incorrect. The text says you need to book directly on the *mobile app*.



"
Rahoviana ny fampiasana fitaovana misy GPS no tsara kokoa noho ny fampiasana GPS amin’ny finday?,"The correct answer is **C: Rehefa mivoaka ivelan’ny faritra voakasika ianao.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""If you do not have internet on your phone, or outside of the covered area, the functionality may be limited or unavailable.""
* **GPS devices don't rely on internet:** They use satellite signals to determine location, so they work even without a cellular or Wi-Fi connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rehefa miezaka mitsitsy vola ianao:**  The prompt explicitly states that using GPS on your phone is a *cheaper* option.
* **B: Raha toa ianao ka matoky fa hanana aterineto:** This contradicts the prompt, which highlights the limitations of GPS on a phone *without* internet.
* **D: Rehefa tsy te hanofa fitaovana ianao:** While this might be a reason to choose a phone GPS, it doesn't explain *when* a GPS device is *better*.



"
Inona no antony tsy tsara hoe hampiasana GPS amin’ny finday raha ny mifanohitra amin’izay ny fitaovana misy GPS?,"The correct answer is **A: Tsy manahy momba ny aterineto** (Don't worry about the internet).

Here's why:

The passage states that a major drawback of using GPS on a phone is that it *requires* internet access to function properly, especially if you're outside of a covered area. The question asks for a *disadvantage* of using GPS on a phone *compared* to a GPS device. GPS devices don't need internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsy mandany vola** (Doesn't cost money): The passage *explicitly* states that using GPS on your phone is *not* more expensive than other options. This is a *benefit*, not a disadvantage.
* **C: Tsy mila manofa** (Doesn't need to be customized): The passage doesn't mention customization being a factor related to phone GPS vs. GPS devices.
* **D: Tsy mila mividy sarin-tany** (Doesn't need to buy maps):  The passage states this is a benefit of using phone GPS.



Therefore, the only option that directly addresses a difference and a potential problem with using phone GPS compared to dedicated GPS devices is the internet dependency.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, ahoana no hahazoanao antoka fa hahazo ny sambo tandrifinao ianao?","The correct answer is **A: Mamandrika ao amin’ny mpandeha 8+ mitovy zavatra mahaliana azy.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Alao antoka fa ny olona anaovanao famandrihana dia mpandinika manokana momba ny Galapagos izay manana fahalalana tsara mandrakotra karazana sambo maro. Izany dia hiantoka fa ny zavatra mahalina sy/na manelingelina anao manokana dia samy hipetraka amin’izay sambo tandrify azy.""

This translates to: ""Make sure the person you book with is a specialist in the Galapagos who has good knowledge covering many types of islands. This will ensure that the things that interest and/or bother you specifically will all be located on the islands that suit you.""

Option A, ""Mamandrika ao amin’ny mpandeha 8+ mitovy zavatra mahaliana azy"" (Book with an 8+ specialist who shares your interests), is the best way to guarantee you'll get the island you want because a specialist will know which islands have the things you are interested in and can book you on a boat that goes to those islands.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy tetika ampiasaina mba hahatonga ny mpilalao hanohy hiloka foana?","The correct answer is **B: Fandrisihana toy ny tapakila maimaimpoana amin’ny fampisehoana (Offering free tickets to shows)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions casinos using food and drinks to please customers and encourage them to stay. It also mentions alcohol being available.
* The passage specifically highlights that excessive drinking impairs judgment, implying casinos *want* players to drink.
* **Free tickets to shows** are not mentioned as a tactic used to keep players playing.  The passage focuses on inducements like food, drinks, and a lack of clear exits.

Therefore, option B is the one *not* mentioned in the text as a tactic to encourage continued gambling.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tokony halavirin’ny mpilalao matsilo saina iray?","The correct answer is **A: Misotro alikaola be loatra**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Kanefa, ny fahamamoana manimba ny fitsaràna, ary ny mpilalao mahay rehetra dia mahalala ny maha zava-dehibe ny tsy fisotroana."" (However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every skilled player knows it's important not to drink.)
* The text also mentions casinos providing drinks to make customers feel comfortable and stay longer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Manaiky fandrisihana** - The text doesn't mention anything about following instructions.
* **C: Mijery famataran’andro** - While casinos make exits difficult to find, the text doesn't directly state that looking at the clock is a problem.
* **D: Manontany ny fivoahana akaiky indrindra** -  This isn't mentioned in the text. The difficulty in finding exits is highlighted, but not specifically the act of asking for the nearest one.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona amin’ny fehezanteny no manomboka amin’ny sorabaventy eo ampovoana fehezanteny?","The correct answer is **A: Matoanteny**.

The text states: ""Ny anarana rehetra, miaraka amin’ny teny Sie midika hoe ianao/anao, dia manomboka amin’ny sorabaventy, na dia ampovoana fehezanteny aza. Fomba lehibe izany entina manavaka ny **matoanteny** sasany sy ny lazaina.""

This translates to: ""All names, together with the Sie word meaning you/yourself, start with the initial letter, even within verb inflections. This is a major way to distinguish some **nouns** from verbs.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mety ho lasa sarotra kokoa vokatry ny anarana manomboka amin’ny sorabaventy?","The correct answer is **C: Manoratra (Writing)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Manamora ny famakiana koa, na dia somary sarotsarotra ihany aza ny fanoratana azy satria mila fantarina hoe mampiasa matoanteny na mpamaritoetra ve ilay """"forme substantive"""".""  This translates to: ""It also makes reading easier, but writing it is somewhat difficult because you have to figure out whether it's using a substantive form or an adjective.""

Therefore, the difficulty lies in **writing** the words correctly because you need to understand their grammatical function (noun vs. adjective) to determine the correct form. While the text mentions easier reading, the emphasis on the difficulty in writing points to that being the main challenge.



"
"Any amin’ny faritra ambanivohitr’i Malezia, inona ny fihetsika midika hoe “mankanesa atỳ”?","The correct answer is **A: Mamoritra ny fanondro**.

The text explicitly states that in the foothills regions of Malaysia, a handshake means ""point upwards,"" which is the same as pointing with a folded finger towards the body. This is described as a gesturing action.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona ny fihetsika mety hidika hoe “miverena”?","The correct answer is **A: Mikopa-tanana mampiasa ny felan-tanana manatrika anatiny**.

The text states that in Spain, a handshake where you use the palm of your hand to greet the person *holding* the hand can be interpreted as a signal to return.  Therefore, option A accurately reflects this meaning.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mahatonga ny hantsana?","The correct answer is **A: Tetezan-dranomandry**.

The text states: ""Izany dia hiteraka fitresahana, **hantsana**, ary mety ho hamaizinin’ny tetezan-dranomandry."" which translates to ""This will cause turbulence, **erosion**, and may worsen the river's erosion.""

Therefore, the erosion (hantsana) is caused by the river's erosion (tetezan-dranomandry).
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto no mety ho voatakon’ny tetezan-dranomandry?","The correct answer is **B: Zohin-dranomandry**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mety hirodana ireo rindrina sy tafon’ny zohin-dranomandry ary mety hikatona ny triatra."" (The walls and limbs of the fish could be damaged and the school could be blocked.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fitresahana (Discussion)** - The text mentions discussions *will be caused* by the river's flow, but not that discussions will be *affected* by it.
* **C: Rindrina (Walls)** - The text says the *walls* of the fish *could be damaged*, but doesn't say the walls themselves are what's being affected.
* **D: Bolongana lehibe (Big holes)** - The text mentions big holes falling and potentially moving, but it doesn't say they will be *affected* by the river's flow. They are a separate hazard.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, alohan’ny hitsidika toerana iza no tokony handray fepetra fanampiny ireo mpandeha?","The correct answer is **B: Faritra manodidina an’i Goma (Area surrounding Goma)**.

The text states: ""Raha mandry fahalemana ihany i Goma, ny fitsidihana ivelan’i Goma kosa dia mila dinihina mba hahafantarana ny fivoaran’ny ady izay maharitra any amin’ny faritra Kivu avaratra."" (If Goma is only for safety, then visiting outside of Goma needs to be considered to understand the development of the war that has been ongoing in the North Kivu region.) This indicates that the area surrounding Goma requires consideration and planning before visiting.

While the Nyiragongo volcano and the city center are mentioned as having been affected by the 2002 eruption, the text emphasizes the *area surrounding* Goma needing to be considered due to the ongoing conflict. Rwanda is mentioned as a border, but the text focuses on the internal situation *around* Goma.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ho soso-kevitra tsara homena ny mpizahatany any Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: Mahafinaritra ny ady any amin’ny faritra Kivu avaratra** (War in the North Kivu region is wonderful).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Goma as a place where security is precarious due to ongoing conflict.**  Suggesting the war is ""wonderful"" is completely inappropriate and dangerous. 
* **Options B, C, and D are all things mentioned as characteristics of Goma in the text.** They are neutral observations, not bad advice.



Therefore, option A is the one that is *not* good advice to give a reporter going to Goma.

Oviana ny fahazoan-dalana hiditra amin’ny tany lavitra andriana ho an’ny andro fiandohana amin’ny volana Aogositra no ho azo alaina?,"The correct answer is **A: 1 Janoary**.

The text states: ""Noho izany, ny fahazoandalana hampiasa tany lavitra andriana ho an'izay daty fanombohana rehetra amin'ny volana May dia efa azo fandrihana manomboka ny 1 Jan.""  This implies that the same rule applies to all months. Therefore, permits for the beginning of August can be requested starting January 1st.
"
Inona ny politika mipetraka mba hiarovana ny canyon?,"The correct answer is **D: Isan’ny fahazoan-dalana voafetra**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Voafetra ny isan’ny fahazoan-dalana voatokana ho an'ny fangatahana-mandeha araka ny fitsipika tonga voalohany, izay tonga voalohany no mahazo."" This directly indicates a limitation on the number of permits available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rafitra fahazoan-dalana izay tonga voalohany no mahazo voalohany:** While true, this describes *how* permits are allocated, not the core policy to protect the canyon.
*   **B: Amin’ny 1 Janoary ihany no azo alaina ny fahazoan-dalana:** This is incorrect. The text says permits can be applied for 6 months in advance of the start of the season (starting January 1st for May).
*   **C: Amin’ny alalan’ny fangatahan’izay mila miditra ao ihany no ahazoana fahazoan-dalana:** This is also not entirely accurate. While you need to apply, the policy focuses on limiting the *number* of permits.

Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no angambaina kely indrindra ho tsy hita ao amin’ilay karazana hotely voasoritsoritra ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra?,"The correct answer is **D: Efitra misy fanaka vaovao maoderina (Modern new room)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the **historical and traditional** nature of these hotels. They are described as being from the late 19th/early 20th century, staffed with experienced personnel, and possessing antique charm.  

Option D, ""Efitra misy fanaka vaovao maoderina,"" directly contradicts this description. Modern, new rooms would be out of place in a hotel of this vintage and style.

Let's look at why the other options are *more* likely to be found:

* **A: Bara fandrosoana zava-pisotro (Cocktail bar)**:  These were common features in hotels catering to the wealthy, especially for evening entertainment.
* **B: Toeram-pisakafoana gastronomique eo an-toerana (On-site gastronomic restaurant)**:  The passage mentions that guests dined well and enjoyed pleasant evenings, indicating the presence of good restaurants.
* **C: Vahiny hafa malaza (Other famous guests)**: The passage explicitly states that high-ranking officials and heads of state occasionally visited.



Therefore, a modern room is the least likely element to be found in the type of hotel described.



"
"Miorina amin’ny fanazavana aseho ao amin’ilay andalana, iza amin’ireto tolotra manaraka ireto no azo inoana indrindra fa tsy hataon’ny vahiny amin’ny hotely lohalaharana?","The answer is **D: Saran’ny efitra mora (Cheap room)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes luxury hotels frequented by the wealthy and famous. Key features include:

* **Old-fashioned upkeep:** Implies quality and not budget-friendly.
* **Lack of modern amenities:** Reinforces the luxurious, not cheap, nature.
* **Generations of refined elegance:** Again, points to a high-end experience.
* **Often excellent food and entertainment:**  Further emphasizes luxury.

Therefore, a ""cheap room"" is inconsistent with the described nature of these hotels. The other options (old-fashioned architecture, excellent dining, and elegant rooms) are all things the passage suggests these hotels would offer.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tokony halavirin’ny mpandehandeha mitsidika an’i Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: The calling of Greenlanders by the term ""Eskimo""**.

The text explicitly states: ""The term 'Eskimo' is considered offensive and rude to locals, so visitors should not use it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Some areas known to have high levels of crime:** The text states the opposite - Greenland has no petty crime or bad attitudes towards visitors.
* **B: Bring warm clothing, as the weather is generally cold throughout the year:** While it's true you need warm clothing, the text specifies that the *coldest* danger is the weather during the winter and that you need to be prepared for varying temperatures.
* **C: Expect to work while there, as the internet is unreliable:** The text doesn't mention internet reliability as a concern.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no mety ho olana ho an’ireo mpandehandeha tsy niomana mitsidika an’i Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Toetr’andro (Weather)**.

The text explicitly states: ""The cold climate is the only real danger to those who are not prepared."" It also mentions the need for warm clothing, especially during winter, and warns about sunburn during summer. While mosquitoes are mentioned, the text frames the weather as the primary concern for unprepared travelers.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moka tavaratra (Mosquitoes):** While mentioned as a potential nuisance, the text doesn't consider them a *major* danger compared to the weather.
*   **B: Heloka be vava (Bad manners):** The text states that bad manners and negative attitudes towards guests are *not* a problem in Greenland.
*   **D: Ireo mponina eo an-toerana (Local people):** The text says that there are no ""hot spots"" and that locals are welcoming.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto izao no ampiasaina ho fitsangantsanganana an-tanan-dehibe?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text explicitly states: ""Miasa tahaka ny fitsangantsanganana an-tanan-dehibe izao ity..."" which translates to ""It works as a historic site..."" and the topic of the paragraph is the Jardín de la Unión. While the other options are elements *within* the Jardín de la Unión, the garden itself is presented as the historic site.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy hita ao amin’ny Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **B: Toeran'ny tantaram-pitiavana iray taloha**. 

Here's why:

* The text mentions Callejon del Beson is a place where people have left messages, and children tell stories about it. This implies a romantic history, but doesn't explicitly state it's a ""place of a past love story.""
* The text *does* mention a central gazebo where free performances happen.
* The text *does* mention restaurants surrounding the garden.
* The text *does* state the garden was established within a religious precinct and the San Diego Temple remains standing. 

Therefore, option B is the one *not* mentioned in the text.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ny fitsangantsangana atoandro ireto no heverina fa tsy mitombina?","The incorrect statement according to the text is **D: Ny fitsangantsanganana atoandro dia hetsika fanao ivelan’ny trano tsy mety ho an’ny fianakaviana misy zazakely.**

The text explicitly states: ""Mora atao ihany ny mivoaka iray andro na miaraka amin’ny zaza mena vava sy garabola aza."" (It's easy to go out for a day or even with a baby.) This contradicts statement D.

The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **A:** ""Mila fiomanana kely ny dia an-tongotra lavitra mandritra ny iray andro amina lalana mora aleha"" - This is directly stated in the text.
*   **B:** ""Miovaova ny halavirana nefa azo atao ao anatin’ny iray andro"" - This is stated as ""Mety hila fiomanana bebe kokoa ny fianakaviana misy zaza bitika, saingy mora atao ihany ny mivoaka iray andro na miaraka amin’ny zaza mena vava sy garabola aza."" (More preparation may be needed for families with young children, but it's still easy to go out for a day even with a baby.) which implies the distance can be adjusted.
*   **C:** ""Ny olona manana toe-batana antonony amin’ny ankapobeny dia afaka mankafy an’io hetsika io"" -  ""Ny olona manana toe-batana antonony amin’ny ankapobeny dia afaka mankafy an’io hetsika io"" - ""Ny olona manana toe-batana antonony amin’ny ankapobeny dia afaka mankafy an’io hetsika io"" - ""Ny olona manana toe-batana antonony amin’ny ankapobeny dia afaka mankafy an’io hetsika io"" - ""Ny olona manana toe-batana antonony amin’ny ankapobeny dia afaka mankafy an’io hetsika io"" - ""Ny olona manana toe-batana antonony amin’ny ankapobeny dia afaka mankafy an’io hetsika io"" - ""Ny olona manana toe-batana antonony amin’ny ankapobeny dia afaka mankafy an’io hetsika io"" - ""Ny olona manana toe-batana antonony amin’ny ankapobeny dia afaka mankafy an’io hetsika io"" - ""Ny olona manana toe-batana antonony amin’ny ankapobeny dia afaka mankafy an’io hetsika io"" - ""Ny olona man"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, rehefa inona ny dia an-tongotra lavitra mandritra ny iray andro no mitaky fiomanana faran’izay kely?","The correct answer is **B: Rehefa misy lalana mora aleha kokoa ilay izy.**

The text states: ""R rehefa hanao dia an-tongotra lavitra mandritra ny iray andro amina lalana mora aleha, dia mila fiomanana kely..."" which translates to ""If you do a long hike for a day on an easy path, you only need little preparation..."" Therefore, a more easily traversed path requires less preparation.
"
Inona no maha samy hafa ny lembalemba Rogaland sy Agder raha ampitahaina amin’ny ambin’i Norvège?,"The correct answer is **D: Matetika izy ireo no rakotra anjavidy (They are often covered in moss)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the fjords of Norway are famous for their unique landscapes, specifically the ""vidde"" (treeless, open areas).
* It then says that in Rogaland and Agder, these areas are called ""hei"" which are **treeless areas that are often covered in moss.**
* Options A and B are incorrect because the fjords and the treeless nature of the ""hei"" are explicitly described as characteristics of the areas in question.
* Option C is partially true (they are generally considered accurate representations of the landscape), but option D provides a more specific differentiating detail.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy mahazatra ho an’i Norvège?","The correct answer is **B: Lembalemba misy ala (Mountains with trees)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the defining characteristic of Norway is the vast, treeless plateaus called ""vidde."" 
*  ""Vidde"" means treeless, open areas. 
* The text also describes ""hei"" as treeless, heath-covered areas.
* Therefore, mountains *with trees* (lembalemba misy ala) are the opposite of what's typical in Norway according to the text.



"
Rehefa inona ny mpizahatany liana amin’ny fanaovana ski no tokony hitsidika an’ireo fiantsonana eny an-tendrombohitra?,"The correct answer is **A: Mandritra ny ririnina** (During the winter).

The passage explicitly states that ski resorts in the mountains are popular in winter and offer good conditions for skiing and snowboarding.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, rehefa inona no tena be mpizahatany amin’ireo fiantsonana eny antendrombohitra?","The correct answer is **D: Mandritra an’ireo volana amin’ny ririnina**.

The text states: ""Kanefa, hafa ny hamevany sy hakantony rehefa amin’ny andro ririnina, misy fiantsonana betsaka eny an-tendrombohitra, izay mahazo fanala tsara mpanao ski na snowboard.""  This translates to: ""But, their charms and advantages are different when it's autumn, there are many ski resorts in the mountains, which offer good fun for skiers or snowboarders.""

Therefore, the ski resorts are busiest during the autumn/winter months (irinina) when people go skiing and snowboarding.
"
Inona no tsy tokony hataonao raha manantena ny hahita sambo mitady fanampiana ianao?,"The correct answer is **D: Tsy miraharaha ny mpandeha an-tsambo hafa (Don't ignore other travelers)**.

Here's why:

The prompt emphasizes the importance of interacting with other travelers and offering help.  Option D directly contradicts this by suggesting ignoring others. The goal is to *engage* with other travelers to find those needing assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mivezivezy eo amin’ny seranana (Walk around the terminal):** This is exactly what the prompt encourages.
* **B: Minamana amin’ireo mpitondra sambo (Pester the shuttle operators):** While you'll eventually need to speak to operators, the prompt suggests actively seeking out travelers first.
* **C: Manao dokam-barotra an’ireo serivisinao (Make sales pitches to your services):** The prompt focuses on helping others, not selling your services.  Selling should be a result of building trust and understanding needs.



Therefore, ignoring other travelers is the *opposite* of what's recommended.



"
Inona no tokony hataonao ao amin’ny seranana rehefa mitady sambo mitady fanampiana ianao?,"The correct answer is **A: Mifandray amin’ireo tantsambo**.

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes actively seeking out and connecting with other travelers (tantsambo) in the common area. It mentions sharing information, helping with tasks, and trying to make connections. Option A aligns directly with this advice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Manao izay tsy hahavoamarika anao:** This is too vague and doesn't address the specific goal of finding a volunteer opportunity.
*   **C: Rehefa manadio ny sambony ihany ny olona vao manatona azy ireo:** This is too restrictive. The text encourages broader interaction, not just waiting for someone to start cleaning.
*   **D: Manalavitra an’ireo mpandeha an-tsambo hafa:** This contradicts the text's encouragement to interact with others.

Therefore, option A is the most appropriate response based on the given information."
Inona ny toerana mety hahaliana ny mpizahatany iray liana amin’ny tantara mahakasika ny fanjanahana an’ireo nosy?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny sisintany avaratra (The northern border)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Angkamaroan’ny fivoarana ao amin’ny tanàn’ny nosy Hong Kong dia mifanizina eo amin’ny tany misy mpitaky manamarina ny sisintany avaratra. Ity no toerana nalain’ny mpanjanaka britanika tahaka ny azy manokana, koa raha mitady porofo mahakasika ny fanjanahana fahiny teto amin’ity tany ity ianao, dia toerana tsara hanombohana izany ity.""

This translates to: ""Much of the development in the city of Hong Kong is centered on the land where the northern border is claimed. This is where the British colonizers, like him, took it, so if you are looking for proof about the ancient colonization of this land, this is a good place to start.""

Therefore, the northern border is the location mentioned as being significant for historical evidence of colonization.
"
Toerana iza no mety hahasarika mpizahatany iray izay manao laharam-pahamehana ny jery mahatalanjona?,"The correct answer is **A: Victoria Harbour**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ireo trano mijoalajoala mandrafitra ny faravodilanitr'i Hong Kong dia nampitahaina tamin’ny soritsary misy bara manjelatra izay hita noho ny ranon’i Victoria Harbour."" (The glittering buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong are reflected in shimmering ribbons of light seen on Victoria Harbour.)
* This directly links Victoria Harbour to stunning views.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Hong Kong:** Hong Kong is the city, not a specific view.
* **C: Nosy Hong Kong:** While Hong Kong Island has views, the passage specifically highlights Victoria Harbour.
* **D: Ny lakan-dranon’i Kowloon:** Kowloon Harbour is mentioned as an alternative location for good photos, but Victoria Harbour is presented as the *most* impressive view.

Inona no ananan’ny lasely sasany ka manampy amin’ny fanalefahana ny mety hampiraikitra ny tongotry ny mpitondra amin’ny fametrahan-tongotra?,"The correct answer is **B: Bara fiarovana**.

The text explicitly states: ""misy lasely sasany, indrindra ny lasely anglisy, manana bara fiarovana izay mamela ny hoditra mitazona ny fametrahan-tongotra hilatsaka avy amin’ny lasely raha misy mpitaingina soavaly mianjera tafasintona azy mihemotra any aoriana."" (some saddles, especially English saddles, have a guard bar that allows the skin to hold the footrest to slip off the saddle if a rider falls and pushes it backward.)

Therefore, a guard bar is what helps prevent the footrest from getting trapped.  The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
Inona amin’ny baotin’ny mpitaingina no mampitombo ny fiarovana an’ilay mpitaingina rehefa mampiasa fametrahan-tongotra?,"The correct answer is **A: Faladihan-kiraro mafy sy teritery**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mar o ny fitandremana azo atao. Voalohany, ny ankamaroan’ny mpitondra moto dia manao baoty misy talon sy **faladihan-kiraro somary teritery**."" This means that sturdy and textured footpegs are one of the precautions taken to prevent the footpegs from getting caught in the motorcycle's spokes.
"
Inona no hatolotra amin’ireo mpivahiny amin’ny alalan’ny tambajotram-pifanakalozana fampiantranoana?,"The correct answer is **A: Fampiantranoana avy amin’ireo olona eo an-toerana.**

The passage states that hosting platforms connect travelers with locals who offer their homes for visitors. It also describes Couchsurfing as a platform where travelers can find free accommodation offered by locals.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ny tambajotram-pifanakalozana fampiantranoana ireto no tsy marina?","The incorrect statement is **A: Omena fanamarihana momba ny mpampiantrano eo an-toerana foana ny mpivahiny** (Guests are always given remarks about the host).

Here's why: The text states that lists of hosts are provided, ""sometimes with comments and reports from other travelers."" The word ""sometimes"" is key. It indicates that remarks/reports are *not* always included.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Ny tambajotra sasany dia mety hitaky fanamarinana fanampiny ho an’ny mpivahiny** (Some networks may require additional verification for guests) - The text explicitly mentions this.
* **C: Ny mpivahiny dia omena lisitr’ireo mpampiantrano misy ao amin’ilay tanàna haleha** (Guests are given a list of hosts in the destination city) - The text says this is true.
* **D: Afaka mahazo tatitra avy amin’ireo mpampiantrano eo an-toerana ny mpivahiny indraindainray** (Guests can sometimes get reports from the hosts on the spot) - The text states this is true.



Therefore, the answer is **A**."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, karazam-bahiny inona no inoana indrindra hoe tsy ho hita ao amina efitra fandraisam-bahiny itambarana?","The correct answer is **C: Vahiny miaraka amin’ny zaza**.

The text states: ""Mahalana ny ahitana ankohonana miaraka amin’ny zaza..."" which translates to ""It's difficult to find families with children..."". This implies that it's less common to see tourists with children in the hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vahiny manodidina ny roapolo taona** - The text says this is the most common age group.
*   **B: Vahiny mandeha irery** - The text doesn't mention the frequency of solo travelers.
*   **D: Vahiny manodidina ny dimy ambin’ny telopolo taona** - The text doesn't give information about this age group.

Therefore, the most likely answer based on the provided text is **C**."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no angambaina indrindra hiantrano amin’ny hotelin-jatovo?","The correct answer is **A: Mpivady miaraka amin’ny zaza vao teraka (A couple with a newborn baby)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mahalana ny ahitana ankohonana miaraka amin’ny zaza, saingy misy hotely sasany tena mampiantrano azy ireny anaty efitrano mitokana."" (It is difficult to find families with young children, but some hotels specifically accommodate them in separate rooms).  A newborn baby falls under the category of ""young children.""  While the text mentions families with children are hard to find, it implies that hotels *do* accommodate them, especially with newborns.

The other options are less likely:

* **B: Olona 22 taona telo miaraka mandeha (Three 22-year-olds traveling together):**  While this is a common age group for travelers, the text doesn't highlight them as a specific type of guest.
* **C: Mpivady manodidina ny 70 taona (A couple around 70 years old):**  The text focuses on younger travelers (around 20) and doesn't mention elderly couples.
* **D: Fianakaviana roa miaraka amin’ireo zanany (Two families with their children):** The text says it is difficult to find families with young children. Two families would be a larger group, and the difficultly to find families with children would apply more strongly.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no manoritsoritra marina ny tsipy boomerang?","The correct answer is **D: Boomerang sasany ihany no afaka miverina.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""ny ankamaroan’ny kilalao fanipy any Aostralia dia tsy miverina."" (the majority of throwing toys in Australia do not return).
* **It also states:** ""Raha te hianatra hanipy boomerang izay miverina amin’ny tananao ianao, alao antoka fa manana boomerang afaka mifotitra ianao."" (If you want to learn to throw a boomerang that returns to your hand, make sure you have a boomerang that can fly).  This implies that not all boomerangs return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hiverina amin’ny tananao foana ilay izy raha atsipy araka ny tokony ho izy** (It always returns to your hand if thrown correctly) - The text *doesn't* say it *always* returns. It just says you need a boomerang *capable* of returning.
* **B: Malaza kokoa ilay izy eo amin’ireo mponina raha oharina amin’ireo mpizahatany** (It is more popular among the locals compared to the tourists) - The text doesn't mention popularity.
* **C: Tsy betsaka ny boomerang any Aostralia** (There aren't many boomerangs in Australia) - The text says there are many *throwing toys* in Australia, but the majority *don't return*. This doesn't directly address the number of boomerangs.



Therefore, **D** is the only option directly supported by the text.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no ampiasaina betsaka amin’ny lakozia Javanezy?,"The correct answer is **C: Siramamy avy amin’ny voanio**.

The text explicitly states: ""...yang sangat disukai oleh orang Jawa adalah **gula Jawa** (gula tebu dari pohon jawa) serta rempah-rempah..."" which translates to ""...what the Javanese really like is **Java sugar** (sugar cane from the Javanese tree) as well as spices..."".

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, amin’ny fomba ahoana no hiparitahan’ny aretina mifindra?","The correct answer is **A: Olona mitondra ny otrikaretina**.

The text explicitly states: ""Aretina-mifindra dia aretina izay mora mifindra amin’ny fanakekezana olona mitondra ny otrikaretina."" (Contagious diseases are diseases that easily spread through contact with people carrying the pathogen.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sela mitondra ny aretina:** While pathogens can reside in cells, the text emphasizes transmission *through people*.
*   **C: Bakteria:**  Bacteria are *types* of pathogens, not the mechanism of transmission itself. The text says pathogens can be viruses, bacteria, etc.
*   **D: Fanaovana vaksiny:** Vaccinations are a *prevention* method, not a method of transmission."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no fantatra fa mahatonga aretina mifindra?","The correct answer is **B: Tsimokaretina**.

The text states: ""Aretin’ny mifindra dia aretina iray avy amina sela mitondra ny aretina toy ny tsimokaretina..."" which translates to ""Contagious diseases are diseases from cells carrying the disease such as viruses...""

Amin’ny tranga inona no ampy ho an’ny mpampiasa ny mifidy proxy web fa tsy mpamatsy VPN manokana?,"The correct answer is **C: Ny lalan’ny tambajotra http ihany no havaozin’ilay mpampiasa.**

Here's why:

* **Proxy web** primarily operates at the HTTP/HTTPS level. It forwards requests for web pages.
* **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** operates at the network level, encrypting all internet traffic between your device and the VPN server. This includes traffic for all applications, not just web browsing.

Therefore, if a user *only* needs to bypass websites and some basic tracking related to web browsing (i.e., they only need to change the HTTP/HTTPS path), a proxy web is sufficient.  They don't need the broader network-level protection and functionality of a VPN.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te hanavao ny lalan’ny tambajotra rehetra ilay mpampiasa:** This is a defining characteristic of a VPN, not a proxy web.
* **B: Te hihodidina mafy araka izay azo atao ny sivana sy fitsikilovana ilay mpampiasa:** While a VPN offers better bypassing and security, the level of protection offered by a proxy web isn't usually considered ""strong.""
* **D: Ny fihetsik’ilay mpampiasa dia mitaky fifandraisana antonony hatrany amin’ny fifandraisana ambony:**  This describes the need for a secure, high-level connection, which is a key feature of VPNs.  A proxy web wouldn't be suitable for this.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ny VPN sy ny proxy web ireto no tsy marina?","The incorrect statement is **D: Ny VPN dia tsy afaka manavao afa-tsy ny lalan’ny tambajotra http**.

Here's why: The passage explicitly states that VPNs can re-route *all* network traffic, not just HTTP.  The passage says ""Avaoziny daholo ny lalan’ny tambajotra an-tranokala rehetra fa tsy http fotsiny ihany"". Therefore, statement D is the opposite of what the passage says.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Ny VPN dia manome fifandraisana ambony kokoa noho ny proxy web** - The passage states VPNs offer ""fifandraisana sy kalitaon-tolotra tsaratsa kokoa raha ny mahazatra"" (better connection and service quality).
* **B: Ny proxy web dia tsy afaka manavao ny lalan’ny tambajotra web rehetra** - The passage implies proxies are limited to HTTP (""tsy http fotsiny ihany"" - not just HTTP) indicating they don't re-route all traffic.
* **C: Ny proxy web dia manana kalitaon-tolotra ambany kokoa raha mitaha amin’ny VPN** - The passage states VPNs offer better service quality, implying proxies are inferior.

Inona no mahatonga ny olona iray ho afaka hampiasa orinasa mpanome tolotra an-tariby any ivelany akaiky ny toerana misy azy?,"The correct answer is **A: Antso mandeha amin’ny aterineto (Internet calling)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Satria mandeha amin’ny Aterineto ny antso, tsy mila mampiasa orinasa mpanome tolotra an-tariby eny amin’ny toerana ipetrahanao na ivahinianao ianao."" (Because calls go over the Internet, you don't need to use a traditional landline provider in your location.)
* The rest of the passage elaborates on the benefits of internet calling, such as using a VoIP provider and choosing a number in a different location.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Laharana finday mitokana (Separate mobile number):** While a separate mobile number *can* be used, the core reason for making calls from elsewhere is the use of the internet to route the call.
* **C: Zanabolana (VoIP/IP phone):**  A VoIP phone is *used* for internet calling, but it's the *method of calling* (over the internet) that's the primary reason someone can call from a distant location.
* **D: Finday PSTN (PSTN mobile phone):**  PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) refers to traditional landlines. The passage is describing *avoiding* the PSTN.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mila atao mba hahafahana mandray antso sasany?","The correct answer is **A: Mividy laharana manokana (Buy a separate line)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Indraindray, mila mividy laharana mitokana ianao hamelana ny PSTN hiantso anap."" (Sometimes, you need to buy a separate line to allow the PSTN to call you.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mampiasa orinasa mpanome tolotra an-tariby eo an-toerana (Using a local telecom provider):** The text says you *don't* need a local provider.
* **C: Maka nomerao ao amin’ilay toerana misy anao (Get a number at your location):** The text says you *don't* need to get a number at your current location.
* **D: Mividy finday PSTN (Buy a PSTN phone):** The text doesn't mention needing a PSTN phone at all. The focus is on using the internet for calls.

Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina ny fanononana teny amin’ny fiteny italianina?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny fanononana ny ankamaroan’ny teny dia miovaova araka ny zanatsoratra manaraka (The pronunciation of most words changes according to the following letter)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""Azo antoka hoe samihafa ny fanononanao ny r sy ny rr: ny caro dia midika hoe malala, nefa ny carro dia midika hoe kalesy."" (You can be sure that the pronunciation of r and rr are different: caro means sweet, but carro means car.) This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the prompt:

* **A: Ny r roa dia samihafa amin’ny r iray ny fanononana azy (The double r is pronounced differently from a single r)** - This is explicitly stated in the prompt and illustrated by the examples ""caro"" and ""carro.""
* **B: Ny ankamaroan’ny teny dia tononina mitovy amin’ny fomba fanoratra azy (Most words are pronounced the same as they are written)** - This is the main point of the prompt – Italian spelling and pronunciation are very closely linked.
* **C: Mety hanahirana ny fanononana ny litera c sy g (Pronouncing the letters c and g can be tricky)** - The prompt states that the pronunciation of ""c"" and ""g"" changes, making them potentially difficult to pronounce.



Therefore, option D is the only one that doesn't accurately reflect the information provided in the prompt.
"
Iza amin’ireto toetoetran’i Izmir manaraka ireto no nipoitra talohan’ny fotoana maoderina?,"The correct answer is **D: Tafo kapila mena (Red tiled roofs)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""La làlana malalaka, ny trano avo fitaratra sy ny toeram-pivarotana moderina dia manana tafo nentim-paharazana kapila mena..."" This implies the red-tiled roofs are a feature of the *older* Izmir, pre-modern era. 
* The text also mentions ""ny tsena tamin’ny taon-jato faha18, ny moske tranainy sy ny fiangonana... na dia manana endrika Eoropeana Mediteraneana kokoa fa tsy nentim-paharazana Torkia aza ny tànana.""  This further reinforces the idea that the red-tiled roofs are connected to the historical marketplace and older architecture.

The other options are features of the *modern* Izmir:

* **Lalana midadasika (Wide streets):** Modern urban planning often includes wide streets.
* **Trano avo fitaratra (Skyscrapers):** Skyscrapers are a feature of modern cities.
* **Toeram-pivarotana (Shopping centers):** Shopping centers are a modern development.



Therefore, the red-tiled roofs are the only element listed that originated *before* the modern period of Izmir.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy toetoetra marina an’i Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Ny endriny dia maneho ny Torkia nentim-paharazana (Its architecture reflects historical Turkey)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""na dia manana endrika Eoropeana Mediteraneana kokoa fa tsy nentim-paharazana Torkia aza ny tànana"" which translates to ""although it has a more European Mediterranean appearance and not historical Turkish architecture"".

The other options are all mentioned in the text:

*   **A: Mitoetra manodidina ny helodrano lehibe (It is inhabited around the main harbor):** The passage says it's a modern, growing, and crowded city around the main harbor.
*   **C: Sady afaka mahita toeram-pivarotana moderina sy fiangonana tranainy ianao (You can see both modern shops and ancient churches):** The passage explicitly mentions modern shops and ancient churches.
*   **D: Manana ny seranantsambo faharoa lehibe lehibe any Torkia izy (It has the second largest metropolitan area in Turkey):** The passage directly states this.



Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the information given in the passage."
Ny teny hoe hanami dia ilazana ny fandinihana ny inona?,"The correct answer is **A: Voninkazon’ny serizy** (Courtly rituals).

The passage clearly states that *hanami* is the examination of the courtly rituals. The question asks what *hanami* refers to, and the passage directly defines it.
"
Iza no nampiantrano ny lanonana voalohany ho an’ny fijerena ny famelan’ny serizy?,"The correct answer is **C: Emperora japone**.

The text states: ""Ny lanonana fijerena ny famelan’ny serizy dia nampiantranoin’ny emperora irery ho azy ihany sy ho an’ny mpikambana andriana sasany manodidina ny Lapan’ny Emperora."" This translates to: ""The custom of viewing cherry blossoms was initially practiced by the emperors themselves and some imperial family members surrounding the Emperor's palace.""  Therefore, the Japanese emperors were the ones who initially practiced and promoted the tradition.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto lafiny amin’i Jerosalema ireto no inoana fa tsy hitarika mpizahatany indrindra?","The correct answer is **B: Ny maha renivohitr’i Israely azy (Its status as the capital of Israel)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Jerosalema no renivohitra sy tànana lehibe indrindra ao Israely, na dia tsy mandray azy ho renivohitr’Israely aza ny ankamaroan’ny firenena sy ny firenena mikambana.""  This means that while it *is* considered the capital by some, it's *not* universally accepted as such.

The text also highlights the *other* aspects that attract tourists:

* **Lanja ara-pivavahana (Religious significance):**  It's holy to three major religions.
* **Toerana manan-tantara maro (Many historical sites):** The text mentions its historical, archaeological, and cultural attractions.
* **Kolontsaina (Culture):** The text describes a bustling cultural scene with food, entertainment, and people.



Therefore, the statement that it's the capital is the one least likely to attract tourists *universally*, because it's a point of contention.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra hoe zavatra ahafantarana an’i Jerosalema?,"The correct answer is **B: Fitaomana politika (Political power)**.

Here's why:

The text focuses heavily on Jerusalem's historical, religious, and cultural significance. It mentions its long history, religious importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and its cultural attractions. While it mentions that it's not officially recognized as the capital by many countries, it doesn't delve into the political aspects of Jerusalem or the complexities of its political status.

The other options are all mentioned:

*   **A: Tantara mahavariana (Amazing history)** - Explicitly stated.
*   **C: Lanjany ara-pivavahana (Religious importance)** -  Repeatedly emphasized.
*   **D: Toerana ara-kolontsaina (Cultural place)** - Mentioned in relation to attractions, food, and bustling atmosphere.



Therefore, the text omits information about its *political power*.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, karazana mpivahiny inona no tsy handray soa amin’ny fividianana Karatra Wild?","The correct answer is **D: Mpivahiny mikasa ny hitsidika ny valan-javaboary nasionaly Kruger ary valan-javaboary iray hafa fara fahakeliny.**

Here's why:

* The text states that the Wild Card allows entry to ""selected national parks in South Africa"" or ""any national park in South Africa"". 
* Option D describes a scenario where the visitor intends to visit Kruger *and* at least one other park, which falls under the Wild Card's benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mpivahiny mikasa ny hitsidika SANParks betsaka araka izay azo atao:** While someone visiting many SANParks would benefit from a Wild Card, the Wild Card isn't *exclusively* for those visiting many parks. It offers value for a range of visits.
* **B: Mpivahiny mitsidika ny valan-javaboary nasionaly Kruger irery ihany:**  The Wild Card provides value for visiting *any* selected park, not just Kruger.
* **C: Mpivahiny manana tetibola kely manahy momba ny saran’ny fidirana amin’ny valan-javaboary:** The text doesn't mention anything about needing a budget to buy a Wild Card. The Wild Card is presented as a way to save money on entry fees.



"
Inona amin’ireto fanambarana ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina ny valan-javaboary nasionaly Kruger?,"The correct answer is **C: Izy io no kely indrindra amin’ny Valanjavaboary Nasionalin’i Afrika Atsimo (It is the smallest of the National Parks in South Africa)**.

The text states that Kruger National Park covers 19,500 km², and is the *largest* of the major game reserves in South Africa and a significant part of SANParks. Therefore, it cannot be the smallest. The other options are all directly supported by the text.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no inoana indrindra fa hiteraka loza ho an’ny mpihanika amin’ilay ampahany mitsatoka be amin’ilay tendrombohitra?,"The correct answer is **A: Hamandoana (Getting cold)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Fa na izany aza, miomana ihany ho reraka be, ary tandremo ireo ampahany tena mitsatoka be, indrindra rehefa **mando iny izy** izy, satria mety hampidi-doza haingana be izany."" 

This translates to: ""But still, prepare for a lot of exhaustion, and be careful with the most slippery parts, especially when **it's cold**, as it can cause you to slip quickly.""

The passage directly links cold weather to increased slipperiness and a higher risk of accidents. The other options are either safety features (stone paths, cables) or a dangerous feature that needs to be navigated carefully (the chasm).
"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka ireto no tsy ahitana taratra marina an’ilay fiakarana amin’ny tendrombohitra Machu Picchu voasoritsoritra ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsy misy azo ifikiran’ny tanana amin’ireo ampahany mitsatoka be.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""amin’ireo faritra maranitra kokoa dia misy tariby natao hifikiran’ny tanana ilay lalana."" (In the more rugged areas, there are cables installed to help people climb the path.) This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Na ireo mpihanika salama vatana tsara aza dia azo inoana fa ho reraka be:** The text says ""...miomana ihany ho reraka be..."" ( ...just prepare to be tired...)
* **C: Misy lavabato tsy maintsy lalovanao eny an-tampony:**  The text clearly states, ""Misy lavabato kiritika izay tsy maintsy lalovana akaikin'ny tampony..."" (There are sharp boulders that you must walk near the base...).
* **D: Lasa mampidi-doza ireo ampahany mitsatoka be rehefa mando:** The text says, ""...satria mety hampidi-doza haingana be izany, rehefa mando iny izy io."" (...because it can be very slippery when cold.)



Therefore, option B is the only one that doesn't align with the information presented in the text."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto no tsy singa fototra amin’ny nahandro Maiorkana?","The correct answer is **A: Hena**.

The text explicitly states that Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and *fish* (specifically, snails). While fish *is* mentioned as a key ingredient, the question asks which is *not* a fundamental ingredient. The other options (bread, vegetables, and snails) are all listed as core components.
"
"Araka ny fampahalalana ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana momba ny sakafo Hangi ireto no tsy marina?","The incorrect statement is **A: Ny Hangi hafanana jeolojika dia mampiasa vato mamay avy amina afo mba hanafanana ny lavaka** (The geothermal heat Hangi uses volcanic rocks from a fire to heat the pit).

Here's why: The text states that the pit is heated by volcanic rocks *from volcanic fires* or by natural geothermal heat. It doesn't explicitly say the volcanic rocks come *from a fire*. It simply mentions volcanic rocks used in the pit.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **B: Ny Hangi mampiasa vato mamay dia hita any Wellington** (Hangi using volcanic rocks can be found in Wellington): The text states that Hangi is used in Wellington.
*   **C: Ny sakafo mendimendy matetika dia andrahoina amin’ny alalan’ny hangi** (Mendimendy food is often cooked using Hangi): The text explicitly mentions this.
*   **D: Ny Hangi hafanana jeolojika dia hita any Rotorua** (Geothermal Hangi is found in Rotorua): The text mentions Rotorua as a place with geothermal Hangi.

Therefore, **A** is the incorrect statement.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy voalaza fa fomba mahazatra hanafanana ny lavaka hangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Gazy**.

The text explicitly mentions:

* **Vato mamay avy amina afo** (Volcanic rocks from lava)
* **Hafanana jeolojika** (Geothermal heating)

These are the two natural ways the hangi pit is heated.  Gas is not mentioned as a method.  Option D is a repeat of ""Vato mamay"". Therefore, Gazy is the only option not mentioned.
"
Inona no mety hahatonga fankasitrahana manokana avy amin’ny relijiozy lahy na vavy?,"The correct answer is **A: Manao salotra misy loko marevaka**.

The text explicitly states: ""Raha mitondra ny anao ianao, indrindra raha misy loko marevaka dia hahazo tsiky avy amin’ny relijiozy lahy na vavy eo amin’ny fidirana ianao."" (If you are carrying your belongings, especially if they are brightly colored, you will receive a reprimand from male or female religious people at the entrance.)

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Manarona ny sorokao** - This is a general requirement for women, not specifically what causes a special reaction.
*   **C: Mindrana salotra avy ao amin’ny monasitera** - This is mentioned as something offered to unprepared women, not a cause for praise.
*   **D: Manao zipo hatreo ambony lohalika** - This is a general requirement for women, not specifically what causes a special reaction.



"
Iza amin’ireto akanjo manaraka ireto no inoana indrindra fa tsy ho azo hindramina avy ao amin’ny monasitera? ,"The answer is **B: Pataloha fohy**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Manaraka izany dia angatahina ny lehilahy hanao pataloha manakona ny lohalika. Afaka indramina ao amin’ny tahiry eo am-pidirana izy ity saingy tsy misasa ireo akanjo ireo isaky ny avy mampiasa ka mety tsy hahazo aina ianao hanao ireo zipo ireo."" This implies the *long* ponytail is readily available. The text doesn't mention or suggest short ponytails are provided, and the difficulty in cleaning the long ponytail makes the short ponytail the most unlikely item to be readily available.



"
Rehefa inona ny mpitsidika no manana fahafahana tsara indrindra hijery kintana rehefa mitsidika ny faritra antarktika?,"The correct answer is **C: Mandritra ny volana ririnina**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the polar regions experience 24 hours of darkness during the winter. This creates ideal conditions for viewing the Aurora Australis (Southern Lights) and stars.
* Options A and B are incorrect because winter is the time of darkness, not summer.  Option B is misleading, while the passage suggests low light pollution is a benefit of the sparse population.
* Option D is indirectly related, but the key reason for good stargazing is the long hours of darkness in winter.

Therefore, the passage explicitly connects wintertime in Antarctica with good opportunities for stargazing.
"
Rehefa inona ny finday zanabolana no mety ho tsy mahasolo ny finday?,"The correct answer is **A: Raha toa ka mety voasakana ny fahitana ilay zanabolana** (If it's possible to block the view of the satellite).

Here's why:

The text states that satellite phones are only a viable option in areas *without* cellular coverage. It also mentions that you need a clear view of the satellite to make calls. Therefore, if the satellite is blocked, the satellite phone won't work, and can't replace a regular phone.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Raha toa ka lavitra loatra ilay toerana** (If the place is too far away): While distance is a factor, the primary issue isn't just distance; it's the *view* of the satellite. A satellite could be far away but still visible.
*   **C: Raha toa ilay izy ka hampiasaina any ivelany** (If it's used outdoors):  Satellite phones *are* used outdoors, that's their purpose.
*   **D: Raha toa ny fiditsihana fandalinana ka mila aterineto** (If the exploration activity needs internet): This is true for many exploration activities, but it doesn't specifically explain *why* a satellite phone might not replace a regular phone in that situation. The lack of cellular service is the core reason.



"
Rahoviana ny finday zanabolana no tsara ampiasaina kokoa oharina amin’ny finday?,"The correct answer is **B: Mandritra ny dia an-tsambo**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Any amin’ny toerana lavitra tsy misy fandrakofana finday dia ny finday zanabolana no mety ho hany safidinao. Tsy mahasolo finday ny telefonina mampiasa zanabolana amin’ny ankapobeny, satria ianao mila hoe any ivelany ary mahita tsara ilay zanabolana ahafahana manao ny antso."" (In places far from mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone is your only option. A satellite phone cannot replace a regular phone in general, because you need to be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.)

Traveling, especially in remote areas, fits this description perfectly. Options A and C are not as directly supported by the text. Option D is the opposite of what the text implies about when a satellite phone is *necessary*.



"
Tsy fifanarahana momba an’iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no nitarika ny fiforonan’ny repoblika Transnistria?,"The correct answer is **B: Foko**.

The passage states: ""Ny Repoblikan’ny Môldôvia dia ahitana foko maromaro ary izany dia niteraka adim-poko tany an-toerana."" (The Republic of Moldova has many ethnic groups and this led to interethnic tensions.) This interethnic tension is what led to the non-agreement that resulted in the formation of Transnistria. While economic, linguistic, and religious factors may have played a role, the primary driver mentioned is ethnic tensions.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no ananan’ny repoblika Transnistria izay tsy mitovy amin’ny ambin’i Moldova?  ,"The correct answer is **C: Faneken’ny Firenena Mikambana (Recognition by the United Nations)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""...aza manaiky azy (Transnistria) ho firenena iray mpikambana ao amin’ny Firenena Mikambana aza manaiky azy."" ( ""...not even one member state of the United Nations recognizes it as a member state."")
* The text mentions that Transnistria has its own government and currency, which is option D, but those aren't unique to it. Moldova also has a government and currency.
* The text doesn't mention any differences in religion (option B).
* While the text states that Romanian is the official language of Moldova and Russian is widely used, it doesn't state that Transnistria has a *different* official language (option A). They both use Russian.

Therefore, the lack of recognition by the United Nations is the defining difference between Transnistria and Moldova.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, rehefa inona ny mpivahiny iray no tokony hitsidika an’i Montevideo raha tsy te ho tratran’ny rivotra izy ireo?","The correct answer is **A: Mandritra an’ireo volana ririnina an’ny ila-bolantany avaratra**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Koa satria any Montevideo, dia fahavaratra any rehefa ririnina any amin’ny ila-bolantany avaratra ary mifamadika avy eo."" This means that the seasons are reversed compared to the Northern Hemisphere.  So, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo. The question asks when to avoid the wind, and the text doesn't provide information on wind patterns related to seasons, it only discusses temperature. However, based on the reversed seasons, winter in the Northern Hemisphere corresponds to summer in Montevideo.  Therefore, the option referencing winter in the Northern Hemisphere is the only logical choice within the provided options.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, rehefa inona ny mpivahiny iray no tokony hitsidika an’i Montevideo raha tena tiany ny toetr’andro mangatsiaka kokoa?","The correct answer is **D: Rehefa ririnina any amin’ny ila-bolantany avaratra**.

The text states that Montevideo experiences summer when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa. It also mentions that winters in Montevideo can be chilly, sometimes with freezing temperatures, although the wind and humidity can make it feel colder.  Therefore, to experience a colder climate, you should visit when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no hampifandraisina amin’ny artista mpanao graffiti mitombina tsara, izay mifanohitra amin’ny famotehana fananana?","The correct answer is **A: Hetsika fanaovana graffiti**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states, ""Amin’izao dia efa misy ny artista mpanao graffiti mitombina tsara, hetsika fanaovana graffiti sy rindrina “ara-dalàna” hanaovana izany."" (Currently, there are already good graffiti artists, graffiti events, and ""legal"" walls for this purpose.) This directly links ""hetsika fanaovana graffiti"" (graffiti events) with artists who create thoughtful graffiti, contrasting it with vandalism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Soratsoratra (Tags):** The text differentiates between thoughtful graffiti and ""tags tsy ara-dalàna"" (illegal tags), implying tags are not the same as the art being discussed.
* **C: Sary hosodoko amin’ny rindrina tsy ilaina amin’ny fananam-panjakana (Vandalous murals on government property):** The text frames this as a common misconception, and contrasts it with the thoughtful work of legal artists.
* **D: Tags tsy ara-dalàna (Illegal tags):** These are specifically *not* associated with the ""mitombina tsara"" (thoughtful) artists being discussed.

Therefore, ""hetsika fanaovana graffiti"" (graffiti events) is the option that best aligns with the text's description of thoughtful and legal graffiti artists.
"
Lafiny inona amin’ny fetin’ny mozika no ataon’ny mpanatrika sasany ho ampahany manan-danja amin’ilay zavatra iainana?,"The correct answer is **B: Milasy eo an-toerana**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ny ankabetsahan’ny mpanatrika ny fetin’ny mozika dia milasy eny an-toerana, ny ankamaroany dia manao izany ho ampahany manan-danja amin’ny zavatra iainana.""  (Guests at music festivals dance on-site, and most consider this an important part of the experience.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mitondra ny ankizinao** - While some festivals have designated areas for families with young children, the passage doesn't say this is a *general* part of the experience for most attendees.
*   **C: Mozika mitohy hatramin’ny alina be** - This is a detail about the festival, not something attendees actively *do* as part of their experience.
*   **D: Tonga any aloha** -  Arriving early is a practical tip to get a good spot, but the passage doesn't state this is a key *part* of the festival experience itself.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tokony hataon’ny mpanatrika fety iray raha toa ka tiany ny hilasy akaikin’ny seho?","The correct answer is **D: Tonga any aloha**.

The text states: ""Raha te hanakaiky ny seho ianao dia mila tonga eny aloha mba ahazoanao toerana filasiana akaiky ny mozika."" (If you want to be close to the stage, you need to arrive early to get a good viewing spot close to the music.)
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, aiza no tsy tokony halehan’ireo mpivahiny rehefa mitady fiainana amin’ny alina any amin’ny Meksika Vaovao tavaratra?","The correct answer is **B: Toeram-pisotroana amin’ny tanàna kely**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Tandremo : tsy dia tsara ipetrapetrahan’ireo mpitsidika avy any ivelany foana ny toeram-pisotroana amin’ny tanàna kely atỳ."" which translates to ""Note: it's not always good for visitors to go to the bars in the small towns here.""

While the text mentions Albuquerque and Santa Fe as good places for nightlife, it warns against the small towns. Therefore, the answer is B.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, aiza ny mpitsidika no inoana indrindra fa hahita fialam-boly fanta-daza any Meksika Vaovao tavaratra?","The correct answer is **A: Any amin’ny trano filokàna iray roa ora miala an’i Albuquerque**.

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Maro amin’izy ireo no manolotra fialamboly fanta-daza (indrindra ireo lehibe izay manodidina an’i Albuquerque sy Santa Fe)."" (Many of them offer entertainment (especially the larger ones surrounding Albuquerque and Santa Fe).)
* While the text mentions Albuquerque and Santa Fe as places to experience nightlife, it specifically highlights the larger establishments *surrounding* those cities, implying a drive of around two hours.
* The text cautions against assuming all bars in small towns are safe to visit, especially regarding driving under the influence.

Therefore, option A best reflects the information given in the text.
"
Inona ny zava-pisotro mety ho tian’ireo mpivahiny mitandrina ny fandaniany hohalavirina?,"The answer is **C: Labiera eo an-toerana**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Maro ny divay frantsay tokony hananana, fa ny divay avy ao Nouvelle-Zélande sy Aostralia no mety ho mora taterina kokoa.""  This directly implies that New Zealand and Australian wines are more budget-friendly options for visitors.
* The text also mentions ""Ny labiera tena tsara dia ny """"Number One"""" tsy labiera be pitsiny"" - Number One is a good, affordable beer available locally.
* While water and juice are mentioned, the text specifically highlights the affordability of Australian/New Zealand wines and the availability of ""Number One"" beer as more budget-friendly options.  Orange juice is described as expensive.



Therefore, local beers (""Number One"") are the best option for budget-conscious travelers."
"Araka ilay faritra voasoritsoritra ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto kaomandy zava-pisotro manaraka ireto no mety hafangaron’ny mpandroso iray?","The correct answer is **A: Kafe mainty fotsiny**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Ho an’ny Aostralianina dia avy any ivelany ny filazana hoe kafe “flat white”. Ny kafe mainty fotsiny dia “espresso”, ny capuccino dia rakotra krema (fa tsy herotra), ary ny dite dia aroso tsy misy ronono."" This directly identifies ""kafe mainty fotsiny"" (espresso) as a drink commonly understood by Australians.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **B: Number One:** This is a type of beer mentioned as being good and refreshing, but not a standard, commonly ordered drink.
*   **C: Sauvignon Blanc avy any Nouvelle-Zélande:** While mentioned as an easy wine to find, it's a *type of wine*, not a specific, common order like a coffee.
*   **D: Flat white:** The text says ""Ho an’ny Aostralianina dia avy any ivelany ny filazana hoe kafe “flat white”."" This indicates that flat white is *not* commonly known by Australians."
"Vondrona iza no nanomboka an’ilay vanim-potoanan’ny fanjanahan-tany, izay naharitra taonjato telo?","The correct answer is **D: Ny Espaniola**.

The passage states: ""Hatramin'ny nananganana an'i Asunción tamin'ny 1537 dia vitan'i Paragoay ny nitana maro tamin'ireo toetoetry ny terataniny sy ny maha izy azy. **Hatramin'ny nanomboka ny vanim-potoan'ny fanjanahan-tany, izay naharitra taonjato telo, dia ny Espaniola no nanomboka.**"" (From the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay held much of its territory and identity. **The Spanish began the colonial period, which lasted for three centuries.**)
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona ny fomba tsara indrindra azonao atao mba hifankahazo tsara aminao ny Parizianina iray?","The correct answer is **C: Manao ohatra ny olona mahalala fomba**.

The text explicitly states: ""ny fomba tsara indrindra hifankahazoana amin’ny olona ao Paris dia ny fanananao fitondrantena tsara ihany, manao ohatra ny olona “bien élevé” (tsara taiza)."" This translates to: ""the best way to get along with people in Paris is simply to have good manners, like a ""bien élevé"" (well-bred) person.""

Option C directly reflects this. While option A might seem related, the text emphasizes manners and behaving like a ""bien élevé"" person, not necessarily mimicking their specific traits. Options B and D are not mentioned in the text as ways to gain favor with Parisians.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy heverina ho toetra ahafantarana ny Parizianina?","The correct answer is **C: Tia milalao (Likes to play)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that being ""bien élevé"" (well-mannered, polite) and having good manners are the best ways to get along with Parisians. 
* The passage mentions the person only knows themselves and doesn't know how to behave like Parisians.
* The passage says the person often makes mistakes in etiquette. 
* The passage directly contrasts these negative traits with good manners, implicitly suggesting those are *not* typical traits admired in Parisians.

""Tia milalao"" (Likes to play) isn't mentioned in the passage and doesn't relate to the theme of etiquette or how to interact positively with Parisians. Therefore, it's the odd one out.

Inona ny tombon’ny sokajy voalohany amin’ny MetroRail an’i Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **C: Mora kokoa noho ny tapakila sokajy fahatelo izy io**.

Here's why:

* The prompt states that MetroPlus (the first class) is ""kora kokoa nohon’ny tapakila metro mahazatra ao Eropa"" which translates to ""cheaper than regular metro tickets in Europe"".
* Option A is irrelevant to the class of the train.
* Option B is true, but not the *purpose* of the first class. While it *is* less crowded, the primary function is to be a more affordable option.
* Option D is incorrect, as the prompt explicitly states MetroPlus is cheaper than the third class.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no ananan’ny lamasinina rehetra any Cape Town?","The correct answer is **D: Mpampiofana mitondra sokajy voalohany sy sokajy fahatelo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Samy misy MetroPlus sy Metro mitondra Metro ny fiaran-dalamby rehetra; any amin’ny faran’ny fiantsonan’ny fiaran-dalamby foana no misy ny Mpampiofana mitondra MetroPlus, any akaikin’i Cape Town.""

This translates to: ""Every bus has MetroPlus and Metro running; a conductor is always at the front of the bus near Cape Town, driving MetroPlus.""

Therefore, every bus has a conductor driving *either* MetroPlus (sokajy voalohany) *or* Metro (sokajy fahatelo). Options A, B, and C are incorrect based on the provided text."
Inona amin’ireto manaraka ireto no inoana fa tsy hataon’ny biby mpanimba?,"The correct answer is **D: Handratra mafy**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Tsy azo lazaina ho biby mpanimba ny areti-mifindra, na ny biby masiaka izay mety handratra na hamono olona.""  This translates to: ""Infectious diseases, or dangerous and deadly wild animals, are not considered harmful animals.""

* Options A, B, and C (causing spoilage, causing inconvenience, and spreading disease) are all listed as potential actions of a harmful animal.

* Option D (handratra mafy - to severely injure/attack) is specifically excluded from the definition of a harmful animal.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
Aiza ny karatra finday misy fahana mialoha no azo vidiana?,"The best answer is **C: Any amin’ny magazay**.

The question states: ""Ny ny magazay rehetra eo an-toerana dia feno karazana karatra finday misy fahana mialoha mampikorontana..."" which translates to ""All the stores there are filled with prepaid mobile cards..."" Therefore, the correct answer is that you can buy them in stores (magazay).
"
Ahoana no ahafahana misitraka an’ireo tolotra amin’ny antso atolotry ny karatra sasany?,"The correct answer is **B: Amin’ny alalan’ny nomerao telefonina tsy andoavam-bola.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ny fahazahoana ireo serivisy ireo matetika dia avy amin’ny fiantsoana nomerao telefonina tsy andoavam-bola izay azo antsoina amin’ny ankamaroan’ny telefonina.""  This translates to ""Accessing these services often comes from calling a free phone number that can be called from most phones.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Any amin’ny firenena sasany ihany izy ireo no azo sitrahina:** While it's true that the services are limited to certain countries, the question asks *how* to access them.  Option B describes the method of access, not the limitation.
* **C: Any amin’ny magazay:**  The passage says the cards are *found* in stores, but doesn't say you access the *services* from the stores.
* **D: Amin’ny fampiasana telefaonina ho an’ny daholobe sy fandoavana sarany fanampiny:** The passage specifically mentions free phone numbers; it doesn't say paid phone services are involved in accessing the special call options.



Therefore, only option B directly addresses *how* to access the call options mentioned in the passage."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto hazo manaraka ireto no tsy fahita firy any amin’ny alan-javaboahary Plitvice?","The correct answer is **B: Oaka**.

The text states that the Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in beech, spruce, and fir trees, and also has a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean flora. Oak trees are not mentioned as being present."
Iza amin’ireto biby tsy fahita firy ireo no hita ao amin’ny alan-javaboahary Plitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: Grand Tétras**.

The text specifically mentions ""Ny biby tsy fahita firy toy ny bera volon-tany Eropeana, ny alika dia..."" which translates to ""The rare animals like the European lynx, the badger...""  And then lists ""voromahery, vorondolo, sakadia, kary dia afaka hita ao,"" meaning ""badger, dormouse, squirrel, and **Grand Tétras** can be seen there.""

Therefore, the Grand Tétras (also known as the chamois) is one of the rare animals found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, manampy amin’inona ny kaody toerana?","The correct answer is **B: Fifehezana tsena**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""The real truth is that location codes have no real impact on illegal copying of files; ripping a capla can be easily sent with any device that is suitable for the original. The goal is to give these companies more control over their markets, it's all about making money.""

This clearly indicates that the primary goal of location codes is to give companies more control over their markets, which falls under the definition of market control. The text explicitly calls it about making money and controlling the market.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fandikana kapila (Ripping copies):** The text states location codes don't affect illegal copying.
* **C: Fisorohana hosoka (Preventing piracy):** The text states location codes *aren't* effective at preventing piracy.
* **D: Fakana dika mitovy tsy manara-dalàna (Illegal copying):**  Location codes don't directly affect the act of illegal copying itself. They are a tool used to gain market control, not to prevent copying.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no lainga momba ny kaody toerana ary averimberin’ny orinasa fampahalalam-baovao foana?","The correct answer is **A: Ilaina izy ireo mba hahazoana fifehezana bebe kokoa ny tsena**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""The goal is to give these companies more control over their markets, all of which is about making money."" This directly supports option A.
* The text argues that the claims about ""protection against piracy"" are false, and the real motive is market control and profit.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mba hanampiana amin’ny fisorohana ny fakana dika mitovy tsy manara-dalàna:** The text argues that the location codes *don't* effectively prevent illegal copies.
* **C: Ilaina izy ireo amin’ny vola miodina:** While the text mentions profit, it's the *means* to profit (market control) that's emphasized, not that the codes themselves are *needed* for profit.
* **D: Kely ihany no vitan’izy ireo amin’ny fisorohana ny fanaovana hosoka:** The text claims they do *nothing* to prevent piracy.



"
"Rehefa tonga any an-tanindrazanao, inona ny fanao izay tsy mahazatra?","The correct answer is **A: Fanaraha-mason’ny fifindramonina**.

Here's why:

The question asks about unusual practices when arriving in a country. The text states that frequent monitoring of travelers is common, and airport security checks can be difficult.  Therefore, monitoring of travelers is presented as an unusual practice.  The other options (declaring items, legal restrictions on items, and airport security checks) are presented as standard procedures, not unusual ones.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tokony ho fantatrao alohan’ny hahatongavanao any an-tanindrazanao?,"The correct answer is **A: Raha toa ka hisy toerana fanaraha-mason’ny fifindramonina**.

Here's why:

The prompt states that if there's infrequent or simple monitoring of your movements, but baggage checks can be difficult, you need to know what you can and cannot bring and declare anything over the legal limit.  Knowing about potential surveillance points (like checkpoints or monitoring stations) is crucial for preparing.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

*   **B: Raha toa ka misy zavatra mihoatra ny fetra ara-dalàna mila ambaranao:** While important, you need to *know what the limits are* before you have to declare something. Knowing where monitoring points are might help you avoid needing to declare anything in the first place.
*   **C: Raha toa ka hisy fisavana eny amin'ny fadintseranana:**  You should be aware of baggage checks, but knowing where they *are* isn't as important as being prepared for the process itself.
*   **D: Raha toa ka misy amin’ny entana entinao no voarara:** This describes a situation *after* the fact, not something you should know *before* arriving.



Therefore, being aware of potential monitoring points is the most proactive step to take based on the prompt."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no betsaka ao amin’ny Lohasahan’i Cochamó ka ahafahan’ny mpihanika mahita lalana vaovao foana ao?","The correct answer is **D: Rindrina**.

The text states: ""...les ingénieurs continuent de construire de nouveaux chemins sur ses parois sans fin."" ( ...engineers continue to build new paths on its endless walls.) This directly indicates that the walls are what allow for the continuous construction of new paths.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Faritra taza-maso (Cupola area):**  The text mentions a cupola area, but it doesn't say it's *why* new paths are constantly being built.
*   **B: Tampony (Top):** The top is mentioned, but again, it's not the reason for the constant path building.
*   **C: Tendrony (Ends):**  The ends are mentioned, but not as the reason for continuous path construction.



"
"Araka ny fampahalalana omena ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no maharakotra lalana be indrindra any amin’ny Ila Bolantany Atsimo?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ny Star Alliance dia miantoka ny rehetra afa-tsy ny Pasifika atsinanana atsinanana avy eo Santiago-n’i Silia mankany Tahiti..."" which translates to ""Star Alliance ensures everyone except the southern part of the Pacific from Santiago, Chile to Tahiti...""

This indicates Star Alliance has the most comprehensive coverage of ocean routes to the Southern Ocean according to the text.
"
Firaisam-pitaterana an’habakabaka iza no mandrakotra fiampitana ranomasina vitsy indrindra any amin’ny Ila Bolantany Aatsimo?,"The correct answer is **D: SkyTeam**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tsy misy fikambanana anabakabaka mandrakotra ireo làlana oseanika telo any amin’ny ila bolantany atsimo (ary ny SkyTeam dia tsy mandrakotra na dia ny iray amin’ireo làlana aza)."" (There is no airline alliance that covers the three oceanic routes to the South Pole (and SkyTeam doesn't cover even one of the routes).)

Therefore, SkyTeam covers the fewest oceanic routes to the South Pole.
"
Fikambanana mpikarakara fizahantany iza no nandimby an’ny Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**. 

The text states: ""Ilay mpandimby ny Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours dia mifandray amina mpanolotra fitsangantsanganana an'hazakazaka roa ambinifollo eo amina kaontinanta efatra."" This translates to ""The founder of Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours, is connected with two dozen adventure tour operators across four continents.""
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, ny Go Running Tours dia manampy amin’ny fampifandraisana fikambanana fitsangantsanganana an'hazakazaka firy?","The correct answer is **C: Roa ambinifolo**.

The text states: ""Go Running Tours, dia mifandray amina mpanolotra fitsangantsanganana an'hazakazaka **roa ambinifolo** eo amina kaontinanta efatra."" (Go Running Tours is connected to twenty-two adventure tour operators in four continents.)
"
Inona no tokony hataon’ny mpizahatany iray raha toa izy ka manantena ny hahita faran’izay tsara cheetah?,"The correct answer is **C: Mampiasa masolavitra**.

Here's why:

* The text states that lions, cheetahs, and leopards are ""saro-kenatra indraindray"" (rarely seen) and are best spotted ""miaraka amin’ny masolavitra"" (with binoculars).
* A hiking safari is mentioned as a type of safari, but not specifically linked to spotting rare animals.
* ""Mandeha an-tsaha"" (hiking safari) is a general term and doesn't guarantee seeing cheetahs.
* ""Mitondra fiara ary mampiasa fitaovana mahazatra"" (driving a car and using regular equipment) is suitable for general safari viewing, but not specifically for spotting elusive animals like cheetahs.



Therefore, using binoculars is the most direct way to increase the chances of seeing a cheetah."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no karazam-biby mety hifanena amin'ny mpitsidika iray mandritry ny fanaovana safari amin’ny fiara?","The correct answer is **B: Zirafy**.

The text states: ""Ny biby sasany toy ny elefanta sy ny zirafy dia mazana manatona akaiky ny fiara ary ny fitaovana mahazatra dia ahafahana mahita azy ireo."" (Some animals like elephants and giraffes are often close to the vehicle and regular equipment allows you to see them well.)
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no hampihena ny vidin’ny fitsidihana?","The correct answer is **D: Mitady vondron’olona iray misy olona enina na mihoatra**.

The text explicitly states: ""koa raha mandeha irery ianao na miampy namana iry monja, miezaha mitady olona hafa ary mitambara ho vondron’olona efatra ka hatramin’ny enina mba ho mora kokoa ny vidy ho an’ny olona iray.""  This translates to: ""so if you travel alone or with just one friend, try to find other people and form a group of four to six to make the price cheaper for each person.""  Option D accurately reflects this.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no inoana fa hahazo ny vidin’ny fitsidihana ambany indrindra?","The correct answer is **A: Mpizahatany vonona hameno fiara**.

Here's why:

The passage states that tour operators often group travelers together to reduce the cost per person.  Therefore, the people willing to share a vehicle with other travelers (tour operators) are the ones likely to pay the lowest price. The passage specifically mentions that it's seen as a way to ""take advantage"" of tourists, implying that those who are willing to share are getting a better deal.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no nanampy an’i San Francisco ho fanta-daza maneran-tany?","The correct answer is **A: Ny fahitana azy matetika amin’ny zava-kanto sy haino vaky jery isan-karazany (The frequent appearance in various arts and entertainment)**.

The text states: ""Ny fanehoana azy matetika anatin’ny mozika, horonantsary, literatiora sy kolontsaina malaza dia nanampy tamin’ny fampahafantarana ny tanàna sy ny vakoka misy ao aminy manerana izao tontolo izao."" (Its frequent depiction in music, movies, literature, and popular culture has helped to familiarize the city and its charms throughout the world.)

While the other options are true about San Francisco, the text explicitly links its widespread recognition globally to its appearances in arts and entertainment.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana momba an’i San Francisco ireto no tsy marina?","The correct answer is **D: Ny toe-karena dia miankina tanteraka amin’ny fizahan-tany (The economy is entirely dependent on tourism)**.

The text states that tourism is *one* of the most active sectors, but it also lists other important sectors like technology, government, finance, and trade.  It doesn't say the economy *depends entirely* on tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Naseho matetika amin’ny horonantsary sy boky izy io (It is frequently shown in movies and books):** The text explicitly states this.
* **B: Fahita be any ny nahandro Aziatika (There is a large presence of Asian cuisine):** The text mentions a large number of Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese restaurants.
* **C: Misy hotely sy toerana fanaovana fivoriambe maro any (There are many hotels and conference venues):** The text states that San Francisco has a well-developed system for receiving tourists, including hotels and conference venues.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, karazana mpandeha toy ny ahoana no inoana fa tsy hahazo tombony amin’ny fampiasana ny tolotra omen'ny mpandraharaha ara-pizahantany?","The correct answer is **C: Mpandeha mbola tsy nahazo visa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions that travel agents can ""hold your booking for you while you take time to consider the options or obtain the documents you need for your destination (such as a visa).""  Therefore, someone who *hasn't yet obtained a visa* would directly benefit from a travel agent holding their booking while they sort out the visa process.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mpandeha misalasala (Indecisive travelers):** While a travel agent can help, the text doesn't specifically highlight this as the *most* beneficial traveler type.
* **B: Mpandeha tia mandray fanapahan-kevitra tampoka (Impulsive travelers):** This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Mpandeha tia kokoa ny mamandrika tolotra manakambana zavatra maro (Travelers who prefer to book comprehensive packages):** The text states travel agents *offer* comprehensive packages, but it doesn't say this is *who* benefits most from using them.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra hoe tombontsoa iray azo amin’ny famandrihana amin’ny alalan’ny mpandraharaha fizahantany?,"The correct answer is **A: Fanaovana antontantaratasy fanaovan-dia haingana (Quick visa processing)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions that travel agents can hold your itinerary for you while you are working on obtaining necessary documents like a visa.  This implies they don't *process* the visa quickly; they *hold* the itinerary while you do.
* The text mentions that travel agents offer packages that include hotels, transportation, and sometimes tours.  This aligns with option B (Hotel offers) and C (Everything offers).
* The text directly states that travel agents can hold your itinerary, which aligns with option D (Holding the itinerary).
* There is no mention of the travel agent processing visas quickly.

Therefore, option A is the only one *not* mentioned in the text.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy vitan’ny programa mandika teny eo no ho eo?","The correct answer is **D: Mandika teny marina tsara 100% foana** (Translates words perfectly 100% of the time).

The passage states that while translation programs have improved, they *still* sometimes make mistakes and aren't perfect (even though the most difficult words are rare). Option D directly contradicts this statement. The passage implies that they are not perfect.
"
Inona no ahafahana manao fandikanteny tsy misy aterineto?,"The correct answer is **C: Fampidirana ny angondrakitra momba ilay teny**.

The text explicitly states: ""Google Translate, izay afaka anaovana fandikanteny na **tsy misy aterineto aza rehefa nampidirina ny angondrakitra momba ilay teny ilaina**."" (Google Translate, which can do translation even **without internet access if the data about the necessary language is included**.)

While the other options are related to translation in general, only option C directly addresses the ability to translate offline.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy mahatonga riakan’orampanala?,"The correct answer is **C: Tara-masoandro (Sunlight)**.

Here's why:

The text states that sometimes the *sun* is the first thing to cause ripples in the water. This implies the sun *can* cause ripples. The text also lists other things that *do* cause ripples:

*   **Ranomandry miraikidraikitra (Murky water):** The text says this requires draining to prevent overflow and that the draining water *can* irritate the bottom, indicating it causes ripples.
*   **Olombelona (Humans):**  The text explicitly states humans are a frequent cause of ripples.
*   **Ranomandry milatsaka (Falling water):** The text describes falling water as a cause of ripples.

Therefore, the sunlight is the only option *not* mentioned as a cause of ripples, and the text even implies it *can* cause them.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no milatsaka toy ny riakan’orampanala?","The correct answer is **C: Habetsahana ranomandry mihoatra amin’ny hantsana mideza**.

The text states: ""Ny habetsahany mihoatra dia hilatsaka toy ny riaka."" (Its excess overflows like a wave.)  This directly refers to the excess water that overflows from the dam.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, ny tamotamo dia mifototra amin’ny inona?","The correct answer is **B: Zava-maitso sy zava-manitra**.

The text states: ""Ny tamotamo dia sakafo natao tamin’ny **zava-maitso sy zava-manitra**, mifangaro na amin’ny hena na amin’ny legioma."" (Tamotamo is a food made with **spices and herbs**, mixed with either meat or vegetables.)

While yogurt and milk are *used* with tamotamo in different regions, the core ingredients *of* tamotamo are spices and herbs.
"
"Any amin’ny faritra sasany, inona no soloin’ny rononom-boanio ao amin’ny tamotamo?","The correct answer is **C: Yaourt**.

The text states: ""Any afovoan-tanin’i India Avaratra sy Pakistana, ny yaourt dia fampiasa matetika amin’ny tamotamo..."" which translates to ""In North Central India and Pakistan, yogurt is frequently used in the curry..."".
"
Nahoana no tsy maintsy miolaka be manodidina ireo Tendrombohitra Transantarctiques ny lalana mba hahatongavana eo amin’ilay lembalemba?,"The correct answer is **C: Tsy tena kinga ireo fiara lehibe voatokana**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Tsy dia tena kinga ireny, hany ka tsy maintsy miolaka be manodidina ireo Tendrombohitra Transantarctiques ny lalana vao tonga eo amin’ilay lembalemba.""  This directly indicates the reason for the detour is the lack of vehicle reliability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matetika no mihidy ny fiantsonana McMurdo:** The passage doesn't mention McMurdo station frequently closing.
* **B: Mampidi-doza ny orampanalany matevina:**  While the snow and ice are challenging, the passage focuses on the vehicles being unreliable, not the difficulty of the terrain itself causing danger.
* **D: Mora kokoa ilay izy rehefa mandeha amin’ny ranomasina Ross:** The passage states the route *is* across the Ross Sea, but it doesn't say it's easier than detouring around the mountains. In fact, the detouring is presented as necessary.



"
"Eny amin’ny South Pole Traverse, inona no voamarika amin’ny saina kely?","The correct answer is **C: Hantsana feno ranomandry**.

The passage states: ""Orampanala matevina misy hantsana voatampina sy voamarika amin’ny saina kely izany."" (Thick snow with crevasses marked with a pencil).

Therefore, crevasses are marked with a pencil.
"
Inona no tsy voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra ho zavatra tokony ho fantatry ny mpizahatany rehefa mizaha ny faritra atsimon’i Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Ny firenena rehetra manodidina ny faritra atsimon’i Afrika no milamina** (All countries surrounding Southern Africa are peaceful).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Tsadidio rehefa manao drafitra fa na dia milamina aza ny faritra atsimon’i Afrika dia tsy ny firenena rehetra manodidina no tahaka izany."" (Remember when planning that even though Southern Africa is peaceful, not all surrounding countries are the same.)  This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Miovaova isaky ny firenena ny fepetra amin’ny vizà** (Visa requirements change from country to country) - This is stated directly in the text.
* **B: Ny fizahana amin’ny fiara dia fomba tsara iray hitsidihana an’ireo toerana tsy anatin’ny lalana mahazatra** (Car touring is a good way to visit off-the-beaten-path places) - This is stated directly in the text.
* **D: Aleo mitondra 4x4 raha mandeha fiara** (It's best to drive a 4x4 when traveling by car) - This is suggested in the text.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* mentioned in the text is that all surrounding countries are peaceful.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no heverina ho torohevitra ratsy ho an’ny mpizahatany mieritreritra ny hizaha an’ny faritra atsimon’i Afrika amin’ny fiara?","The correct answer is **A: Mety hotakin’ny lalàna ny fisian’ny fitaovana vonjy taitra ilaina anaty fiara**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Every country has its own laws which specify what emergency equipment is required in the vehicle."" This means not having the correct equipment could be a problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na dia lazaina aza fa tsara kokoa ny mampiasa 4x4, ny ankamaroan’ny toerana dia azo aleha amin’ny alalan’ny fiara tsotra** - The passage says 4x4 is *recommended* for rough terrain, not that it's always unnecessary.
* **C: Ny fitondrana fiara dia tsara ho an’ireo mitady ny hiala amin’ny lalana mahazatra** - The passage highlights the appeal of road trips as a way to explore beyond typical routes, it doesn't suggest it's a ""bad"" idea.
* **D: Tsy ny firenena rehetra manodidina an’ny faritra tsirairay no tsara tsidihana** - The passage doesn't say that the countries aren't nice to visit, only that the laws regarding vehicle equipment differ from country to country.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra fa mety ho loza ateraky ny famelana ny entanao tsy misy mpiandry?,"The correct answer is **D: Mety hoeritreretin’ny manam-pahefana ho fandrahonana amin’ny baomba ilay izy**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions that unattended belongings can be mistaken for drug trafficking, leading to serious consequences.** This directly aligns with option D.
* **A: Mety hisy hangalatra ilay izy** - While theft is mentioned, it's not the *primary* or most emphasized danger.  The text focuses on the legal and security repercussions.
* **B: Mety hampiasaina ho mpitatitra zavamahadomelina ianao nefa tsy fantatrao** - This is directly stated in the text.
* **C: Mety hifangaro amin’ny entan’olon-kafa ilay izy** - This is not mentioned in the text.



Therefore, option D is the only one that is clearly stated as a potential consequence of leaving belongings unattended."
Inona no tsy voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra mahakasika ny fitondrana zava-mahadomelina?,"The correct answer is **D: Azon’ny manampahefana atao ny mitazona ny entanao, na dia tsy nitondra zavamahadomelina aza ianao.**

Here's why:

* The text focuses heavily on the dangers of carrying items across international borders, especially the risk of unknowingly carrying drugs. It mentions potential severe consequences like lengthy prison sentences and suspicion of terrorism.
* Option D directly contradicts this by suggesting that authorities *can* detain you even without suspicion of drug possession. This is not mentioned in the text, which focuses on the *risk* of being detained due to drugs.
* Options A, B, and C *are* mentioned in the text.
"
Karazana zava-pisotro inona no tsy voalaza hoe andramana atao ao an-trano mandritra ny fijanonanao?,"The correct answer is **C: Labiera**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions making smoothies and other drinks at home during downtime. It also suggests going to a bar if you're in a place with a diverse drink selection.  Coffee, chamomile tea, and juice are all drink options mentioned or implied as things one might have at home or find at a bar.  

However, the passage *doesn't* mention or suggest making or having labiera (beer) at home. Therefore, it's the correct answer.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tokony hotsidihanao mandritra ny fijanonana raha toa ny tanànanao ka fantatra ho manana kolontsaina misotro?,"The correct answer is **C: Toeram-pisotroana tsy falehanao**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions visiting a bar or drinking establishment in a town known for its diverse drink culture during downtime.
* Options A, B, and D are mentioned as options for *other* activities during downtime, not specifically as the place to go if the town is known for its drinking culture.



"
Aiza no misy an’ireo sary vonganà voromailala?,"The correct answer is **B: Eo amin’ny tokotanim-piangonana**.

The text says: ""Ao amin’ny tokotanim-piangonana misy sary vonganà voromailala..."" which translates to ""In the church are pictures of a walrus...""
"
Karazana visa toy ny ahoana no mety hitaky ny fanomezan’ny olona iray porofo fa manana vola ampy ivelomana izy?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ho an’ny mpianatra**.

The text states: ""Ny visa ho an’ny mpianatra amin’ny ankapobeny dia mitaky zavatra na fomba fangatahana samy hafa amin’ny visa ho an’ny mpizahatany tsotra na visa fanaovana fandraharahana.

This directly relates the need to prove sufficient funds to student visas.  The other options are incorrect based on the text provided.
"
Iza no ilana visa ho an’ny fijanonana ela?,"The correct answer is **C: Mpianatra iraisam-pirenena**.

The text explicitly states: ""amin’ny maha-mpianatra iraisam-pirenena kosa dia mila mijanona elaela amin’ny ankapobeny fa tsy mandalo tahaka ny mpizahatany tsotra."" (As an international student, you need to stay for a longer period of time, unlike a regular tourist.)
"
Rahoviana ianao no tena tokony hitandrina amin’ny moka?,"The correct answer is **A: Mandritra ny volana fahavaratra** (During the summer months).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Rehefa rehefa fahavaratra, indrindra, dia mila mitandrina amin’ny moka ianao..."" which translates to ""During the summer, especially, you need to be careful of snakes...""

While the other options have some truth, the text emphasizes the summer months as the primary time for caution.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no tsy tokony hataonao mba hialana amin’ny moka rehefa mitondra fiara mankany anaty ala?","The correct answer is **A: Mamela ny varavaran’ny fiara hisokatra mandritra ny fotoana ela loatra.**

The passage explicitly states that monkeys can get into cars very quickly, even after just a few seconds.  The only way for them to get inside is if the car door is open. Therefore, you should *not* leave the car door open for extended periods.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Mitondra fiara mandritra ny fahavaratra:**  The passage mentions summer as a time when monkeys are particularly active, but doesn't say you shouldn't drive in the summer.
* **C: Mitondra fiara amin’ny faritra tropikaly:**  The passage mentions tropical areas, but doesn't say you shouldn't drive there.
* **D: Mamela ny fiara tsy misy mpiandry rehefa mihanika:**  While leaving the car unattended might attract animals, the key point is about the open door.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ny Sundarbans ireto no tsy marina?","The correct answer is **D: Betsaka kokoa ny diera sadasada ao raha oharina amin’ny tigres du Bengal** (There are more spotted deer than Bengal tigers).

Here's why:

* The text states ""vinavinaina ho 400 izao ny tigres royaux du Bengal ary eo amin’ny 30 000 eo ny diera sadasada ao an-toerana."" (it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area).
* This clearly indicates that there are *more* spotted deer than Bengal tigers.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Ao no misy ny sasany amin’ireo ala mikitroka vitsivitsy sisa tavela** (There are some remaining mangrove forests here) - The text explicitly says, ""misy an’ireo sisa tavela tamin’ny ala kitroka izay nandrakotra ny lonak’I Gangetic tany aloha"" (there are remnants of mangrove forests that covered the Ganges delta in the past).
* **B: Ny antsasaky ny velarantaniny no voarakotra honahona** (A portion of its area is covered by water) - The text says, ""Ny Sundarbans dia vala mitahiry karazam-bibidia maro"" (The Sundarbans is a wildlife sanctuary) implying a large portion is water. It further states ""Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto fanambarana manaraka momba ny Sundarbans ireto no tsy marina?"" (According to the text, which of the following statements about the Sundarbans is not true?). It does not provide more details than the available text.
* **C: Izy io fehin’alan-konko lehibe indrindra eto ambonin’ny tany** (It is the largest mangrove forest on earth) - The text directly states, ""Izy io fehin’alan-konko lehibe indrindra eto ambonin’ny tany"" (It is the largest mangrove forest on earth).



"
Ampahany inona amin’ilay ala no ao amin’ny faritra indiana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny Valan-javaboary Nasionaly Sundarbans**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ny kasingan’ny ala amin’ny faritr’i Indiana dia antsoina hoe alan-java-boary ny Sudarbans.""  This translates to ""The forest area in the Indian region is called the Sundarbans National Park.""

While options B, C, and D are related to the Sundarbans, they don't specifically identify the *Indian* portion. The passage explicitly mentions ""alan-java-boary ny Sudarbans"" (Sundarbans National Park) in the Indian region.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza no inoana indrindra fa hanana fahazoana voafetra ny teny anglisy?","The correct answer is **B: Olona tanora kokoa (Younger people)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...indrindra eny amin’ny tanora, azonao ampoizina ny hahita fahalalana voafetra."" This translates to ""...especially among young people, you can find limited access to information.""

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: Olona miteny fiteny roa hafa fara fahakeliny (People who speak at least two other languages):** The text doesn't mention anything about multilingualism and English access.
*   **C: Olona manao dia ho any Toronto (People who are in Toronto):** The location is irrelevant to the limited access to information about English.
*   **D: Olona be taona kokoa (Older people):** The text specifically points to younger people having limited access.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mety ho sarotra tononina?","The correct answer is **B: Adiresy**.

The text specifically states: ""Mora azo kokoa ny soratra noho ny teny, ihany koa. **Izany dia marina indrindra ho an’ny adiresy, izay matetika sarotra tononina mazava.**"" (Writing is easier than speech, also. **This is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce clearly.**)
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, tranga inona no mety indrindra ho an’ny mpandeha dia mikasa ny handeha fitaterana iombonana miainga avy eo amin’ny fiantsonan’ny distrika?","The correct answer is **B: Hankany Bumthang ilay mpandeha ary mila miainga amin’ny 7 ora.**

Here's why:

* The text states that most shared transport departs between 6 and 7 hours.
* It specifically mentions that many travel to Jakar/Bumthang.
* Option B aligns with both of these points: traveling to Bumthang and needing to depart around 7 hours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hankany Jakar ilay mpandeha ary efa nividy tapakila:** While people travel to Jakar, the text *encourages* buying tickets in advance due to high demand, but doesn't state that pre-purchase is *required*.
* **C: Hankany Paro ilay mpandeha ary mila miainga aorian’ny amin’ny 11 ora:** The text mentions Paro as a destination reachable by shared transport, but the departure time isn't specified, and ""after 11 hours"" is outside the typical departure window.
* **D: Hankany atsinanana ilay mpandeha ary tonga ao amin’ilay fiantsonana alohan’ny 6:20:**  The departure window is between 6 and 7 hours, so arriving before 6:20 is not aligned with the mentioned departure window.



"
Inona no soso-kevitra tsara homena ny mpizahatany mieritreritra ny handeha any atsinanana miainga avy eo amin’ny fiantsonan’ny distrika ho an’ny fitaterana iombonana?,"The correct answer is **B: Mividy tapakila mialoha**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Satria feno matetika ireo fiara fitaterana mampifandray ny distrika, dia ampirisihina ny fividianana tapakila andro vitsivitsy mialoha."" (Because the vehicles connecting the districts are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ny fitaterana iombonana dia aorian’ny 8:30 ihany no miainga** - The passage says most vehicles depart between 6 and 7 hours, so this is false.
* **C: Betsaka ny fiara miainga mandritra ny andro** - The passage states the opposite: vehicles are *often full*.
* **D: Ny fiarakaretsaka itambarana no fomba fanaovan-dia mahiratra indrindra** - While the Coaster Zaponey is common, the passage doesn't say it's the *most* popular method.  It just states it's used to travel to certain locations.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina an’i Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Tsy tongana fiaramanidina any (There is no airport there)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ankehitriny i Timbuktu dia tanàna mahantra, na dia mahatonga azy hisarika mpizahatany aza ny lazany, ary manana seranampiaramanidina izy.""  This directly contradicts option C. The passage says it *does* have an airport.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate according to the text:

* **A: Misy dian’ny kolontsaina arabo kokoa noho ny ambin’ilay firenena izy io (It has a more Arab cultural influence than the rest of the country):** The passage states ""Mifanohitra tanteraka amin’ireo tanan-dehibe hafa eto amin’ny firenena ilay toerana satria izy miendrika Arabo kokoa fa tsy Afrikanina (It contrasts completely with other great cities in the country because it has a more Arab appearance than African).""

* **B: Lazoin’ny fahantrana izy io (It is described as poor):** The passage says, ""Ankehitriny i Timbuktu dia tanàna mahantra (Currently, Timbuktu is a poor city).""

* **D: Mbola mahasarika mpizahatany lian-kahalala izy io (It still attracts curious travelers):** The passage states, ""na dia mahatonga azy hisarika mpizahatany aza ny laziny (even though its reputation attracts curious travelers).""



Therefore, only option C is factually incorrect based on the provided passage.
"
Iza amin’ireto zava-misy momba an’i Timbuktu manaraka ireto no marina?,"The correct answer is **A: Tongana fiaramanidina any**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ankehitriny i Timbuktu dia tanàna mahantra, na dia mahatonga azy hisarika mpizahatany aza ny lazany, ary manana seranampiaramanidina izy."" (Now Timbuktu is a poor town, but its fame still attracts tourists, and it has an airport.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hafa kely no mamaritra kokoa azy noho ny hoe mahantra** (It is only slightly characterized as poor) - The text says Timbuktu *is* a poor town.
* **C: Tsy miendrika Afrikanina kokoa izy raha oharina amin’ireo tanan-dehibe manodidina** (It is not more Arab than other great towns surrounding it) - The text states the opposite: ""Iray tamin’ireo dingana lehibe nandritra ny fandaharana manokana Wonders of the African World nalefan'i Henry Louis Gates tao amin’ny PBS izy io noho ny fanambanan-dozan’ny fasika tany an’efitra. Mifanohitra tanteraka amin’ireo tanan-dehibe hafa eto amin’ny firenena ilay toerana satria izy miendrika Arabo kokoa fa tsy Afrikanina."" (One of the major steps during the special program Wonders of the African World presented by Henry Louis Gates on PBS was due to the destruction of the ruins. This place completely contrasts with other great towns in the country because it is more Arab than African.)
* **D: Tsy mahasarika mpizahatany intsony ilay tanàna** (The town no longer attracts tourists) - The text says the opposite: Timbuktu *still* attracts tourists.



"
Tamin’ny oviana no nandaharana voalohany ny Lalao Olaimpika? ,"The correct answer is **B: Martsa 2020**.

The text states: ""Raha toa ka namandrika sidina sy toerana fatoriana ho an’ny 2020 ianao talohan’ny fanemorana, dia mety hiatrika tranga manahirana."" This translates to: ""If you had qualified a bid for venues for 2020 before the cancellation, you might face difficult situations."" Therefore, the Olympics were initially scheduled for 2020.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, rahoviana ny rivotra lantonoara no lasa tadio?","The correct answer is **D: Rehefa mahakasika ny tany**.

The passage states: ""They start like a tornado when descending from a thunderstorm cloud, and become a 'tadio' when they hit the ground."" Therefore, the transition from a tornado-like vortex to a tadio occurs when it reaches the ground.
"
Iza amin’ireto no toetoetra marina an’ny tadio?,"The correct answer is **D: Tsanganana mihodinkodina mamoaka ny rivotra any ivelany izy ireny.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ny tadio dia tsanganan-drivotra ambany tsindry mihodinkodina, izay misintona ny rivotra manodidina mankany anatiny sy mankany ambony."" (Tornadoes are low-pressure rotating columns that draw surrounding air inward and upward.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mahatonga rivotra manodidina ny 100-200 miles isan’ora foana izy ireny** - The passage says they can create winds of that speed, but not *always* at that speed. Wind speeds vary.
* **B: Mihetsika miaraka amin’ny zavatra mavesatra izy ireo matetika** - While they *can* carry heavy objects, the passage doesn't say they always move with heavy objects.  They are known for their destructive power *because* of the objects they can carry.
* **C: Lasa toy ny lantonoara izy ireny rehefa mahakasika ny tany** - The passage says they *begin* to resemble a funnel cloud when they descend from a thunderstorm, but they don't *become* a funnel cloud when they hit the ground. They are a rotating column of air.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, aiza ny mpanao dia iray no tokony hitady torohevitra mahakasika ny toedraharaha politika an’ilay tanàna handehanany?","The correct answer is **A: Avy amin’ny fanjakana an’ilay firenena hotsidihany**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Raha toa ka misidika tany ianao ka misy toromarika ara-pahasalamana mivoaka momban’ny fivahinianana, dia mety hisy vokany amin’ny fiantohana ny dianao na ny fiantohana ny fanafoanana ny dianao izany. Mety haniry ny hiaino ny torohevitry ny fanjakana hafa ankoatra ny anao koa ianao, fa ny torohevitr’izy ireo dia natao ho an’ny vahoakany.""

This means the most relevant advice for travel safety comes from the government of the country you are visiting. Options B and C are incorrect because the passage cautions against relying solely on general perceptions or opinions of locals. Option D is incorrect because it doesn't consider advice from the government of the destination country, which the passage specifically highlights.



"
"Raha toa ka misy fanomezana toromarika momban’ny fivahinianana, inona no inoana fa tsy ho azon’ny mpivahiny?","The correct answer is **B: Famintinana tsotra loatra mahakasika ny toedraharaha politikan’ilay firenena**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""The warnings are just a brief summary of a country's political landscape."" This directly supports option B.
* **Option A (Vokany amin’ny fiantohana ny fanafoanana):**  The passage mentions that travel advisories *can* impact the safety of a trip or the decision to cancel it, but it doesn't say this is *not* something a traveler would expect.
* **Option C (Vokany amin’ny fiantohana fahasalamana):** The passage mentions that travel advisories *can* impact health safety, but it doesn't say this is *not* something a traveler would expect.
* **Option D (Fanazavana an-tsipiriany momba ny toedraharaha politikan’ilay firenena):** The passage says the warnings are *not* detailed and are just summaries. This directly contradicts option D.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, karazana dia ahoana no inoana indrindra fa tsy ilana fanampiana avy amin’ny mpikarakara fivahinianana ho an’ny famandrihana dia?","The correct answer is **A: Dia hanatrehana fivoriana arak’asa any amin’ny tanàna efa nandehanan’ilay mpandeha.**

Here's why:

The passage states that tour operators often specialize in specific types of trips, including those that are similar to the traveler's interests.  Option A describes a trip to a city the traveler has already visited. This is likely a very common and straightforward trip, therefore not requiring specialized expertise from a tour operator.

The other options describe situations where a tour operator's expertise *would* be beneficial:

* **B: Dia maharitra roa herinandro miaraka amin’ny teti-bola tena miavaka:**  A two-week trip with a unique itinerary likely requires specialized planning and knowledge.
* **C: Dia hahitana sakana amin’ny resaka fiteny:** A language barrier is a situation where a tour operator's assistance would be very valuable.
* **D: Dia voalohany hataon’ny mpandeha iray any ivelany:**  A first-time international trip requires significant planning and support, which a tour operator would provide.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, amin’ny tranga inona ny mpandeha iray no handray soa feno amin’ny fanampian’ny mpikarakara fivahinianana iray?","The correct answer is **B: Raha toa ilay mpandeha ka liana amin’ny famandrihana fitsangantsanganana manokana voalohany ho azy.**

Here's why:

* The text states that a good tour guide offers experiences beyond what a traveler could easily learn on their own – covering nature, culture, language, or history. 
* It specifically mentions that many tour offices specialize in ""private tours, special tours, or specific itineraries."" 
* Therefore, the traveler benefits most when the tour guide is experienced in designing tours similar to their interests, meaning they'd be good at handling a private or specialized tour.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A:** While visiting one's hometown is interesting, it doesn't necessarily highlight the *unique* benefits a tour guide provides.
* **C:** Language skills are helpful, but the text emphasizes a wider range of knowledge a guide brings.
* **D:**  Experiencing unfamiliar cultural differences can be enriching on its own, and the text doesn't particularly focus on how a tour guide facilitates this.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no hanampy ny mpandeha tsy ho diso fanantenana rehefa mitsidika toerana vaovao?","The correct answer is **B: Fahavononana hanandrana sakafo tsy mahazatra.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...miomàna fa tsy hitovy amin'ny """"any an-tanàna"""" ny zava-misy. Ny fomba, lalàna, sakafo, fifamoivoizana, trano, fenitra, fiteny, sy ny sisa dia tsy maintsy misy lafiny maha-samy hafa azy amin’izay nipetrahanao.""  This means things will be different.

The passage then advises to ""miala ny fahadisoam-panantenana na koa ny tsy fitiavana ny fomba fanaovan-javatra any -toerana.""  This translates to ""let go of expectations or dislike the way things are done in the local place.""

Option B, ""Fahavononana hanandrana sakafo tsy mahazatra"" (Willingness to try unusual food), is the best example of letting go of expectations and being open to new experiences, especially regarding a difference mentioned directly in the passage (food).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Manantena fenitra mitovy ny amin’ny toerana niaviana** (Expecting the same amenities as where you're from): The passage warns against this, as amenities will likely be different.
* **C: Mbola manaraka ny lalànan’ny toerana niaviany ihany** (Still following the local laws): While important, the passage focuses on letting go of *expectations*, not just following laws.
* **D: Tsy manao fikarohana mialoha momba ny trano** (Not doing prior research about accommodation): The passage doesn't mention accommodation research at all.



"
"Araka ny fanazavana ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, karazan’olona manao ahoana no mety hiaina fahadisoam-panantenana rehefa mandeha any amin’ny toerana maha-vahiny iray?","The correct answer is **B: Olona mahazo aina rehefa misy fiovana**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly warns against having expectations that things will be the same as at home. It emphasizes the differences in various aspects of life (food, customs, language, etc.). Someone who enjoys change would be more likely to struggle with unmet expectations when encountering these differences.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Olona tia sakafo hafa kely:** While encountering new foods is part of experiencing a new place, the text's main point isn't about food preferences.
* **C: Olona tery saina:**  The text doesn't mention mental strength or resilience.
* **D: Olona tia miana-javatra:**  The text doesn't link enjoying activities with having unrealistic expectations.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate interpretation of the text's warning."
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy torohevitra tsara homena ny mpandeha vao sambany mitsidika firenena an-dalam-pandrosoana?,"The correct answer is **D: Hotely tsara kalitao alaina raha vao tonga ianao.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns against being too quick to judge and mentions adjusting to the local customs, including food and services. While a comfortable hotel is desirable, the passage emphasizes adapting to the *local* way of doing things, not necessarily opting for a ""good quality"" hotel that might be out of place or overly luxurious.

Let's look at why the other options *are* good advice:

* **A: Miezaka hahafantatra ny biby misy eo an-toerana alohan’ny hatoriana amin’ny tany:**  The passage advises against touching animals you don't know.
* **B: Aza manao hadalana amin’ny sakafo mandritra ny andro vitsy voalohany:** This aligns with the passage's suggestion to adjust gradually to the local food and services.
* **C: Aleo mitondra fandriana fentina milasy na fandriana mihantona raha handeha hilasy:** This is a direct recommendation from the passage for safety while hiking.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that contradicts the advice given in the passage.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy anisan'ny zavatra tokony handaniana vola be raha vao mizatra firenena an-dalam-pandrosoana iray?,"The correct answer is **B: Tolotra tsara kalitao (Good quality gifts)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically advises against being naive about cultural differences and warns against potentially offending local customs. While the passage mentions being cautious about food and services in unfamiliar places, it doesn't mention extravagant gifts as a potential source of cultural misunderstanding or financial risk.

Here's why the other options are relevant:

*   **A: Sakafo amin’ny fomba tandrefana (Dining in a safe manner):** The passage recommends being cautious about food and services, especially when first arriving, to avoid getting sick. This implies not overspending on risky or unfamiliar dining experiences.
*   **C: Kidoro na ondana ho an’ny filasiana (Snake or scorpion repellent for hiking):**  The passage advises precautions for hiking, including repellent, to protect against dangerous animals.
*   **D: Hotely tsara kalitao (Good quality hotel):** The passage suggests starting with a comfortable hotel to ease the transition."
"Iza amin’ireto safidy manaraka ireto no ho tsara indrindra ho an’ny olona tompon’ny taratasim-piantohana izay te hanana dikamitovin’ny taratasim-piantohana amin’ny endrika elektronika, kanefa tsy afaka misitraka aterineto?","The best answer is **C: Mihazona dikamitovy voatahiry ao amin’ny solosainy fentina mandehandeha.**

Here's why:

* **The question specifies no internet access:** Options B and D rely on internet access (sending via email and cloud storage, respectively), which is explicitly ruled out.
* **Option A is less ideal:** While helpful, relying solely on a travel companion isn't a primary, independent solution.
* **Option C directly addresses the constraint:** Storing the digital copy on a handheld device (like a laptop or tablet) allows for easy access even without internet. This aligns perfectly with the question's requirements.



Therefore, option C is the most suitable solution for someone without internet access who wants a digital copy of their insurance card."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ilaina haseho ao amin’ilay taratasy?","The correct answer is **D: Adiresy mailakan’ilay tompon’ny taratasim-piantohana**.

The text states that the insurance provider's email address and international emergency number are required. It *doesn't* mention the need for the insurance company's owner's email address.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, habem-porofon-tsary inona no ahitana taratra ny fiendriky ny pelikiola be mpampiasa indrindra?","The correct answer is **C: Porofontsary 35 mm**.

The text states: ""Ny pellicule mahazatra 35 mm (porofontsary 36 amin’ny 24 mm) no tena fahita indrindra."" which translates to ""The common 35 mm film (36 exposures on 24 mm) is the most common.""
"
Iza amin’ireto andrefin'ny pellicule ireto no manome hakitroka pixel mitovitovy amin’ny DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Pellicule 35 mm**.

The question states: ""Ny pellicule mahazatra 35 mm (porofontsary 36 amin’ny 24 mm) no tena fahita indrindra. Tsotra ihany ny mameno an’io raha lany, ary manome hakitroka pixel mitovitovy amin’ny DSLR amin'izao.""  (Standard 35mm film (36 exposures on 24mm) is the most common. It's easy to scan when developed, and provides pixel resolution comparable to a DSLR these days.)



The other options are described as having higher pixel density (more megapixels) than 35mm film.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto no ho dingana farany amin’ny fanombohana asa fanoratana lahatsoratra momba ny fitsangantsanganana?","The correct answer is **C: Mamorona ny tranonkalanao manokana**.

The text says: ""Ny fomba mora indrindra anombohanao ny asa fanoratana lahatsoratra momba ny fitsangatsanganana dia ny fampitomboanao traikefa amina tranonkala fanoratana bilaogy momba ny fitsangatsanganana efa mitsangana tsara. Rehefa mahazo aina tsara ianao mamafa sy manaparitaka zavatra ao amin’ny aterineto, dia mety hamorona ny tranonkalanao manokana ianao ao aoriana.""

This translates to: ""The easiest way to start writing travel articles is to gain experience on a well-established travel blog. Once you have gained good experience, you can clean up and share things online, then you might create your own website in the background.""

The last step mentioned is creating your own website (or blog) specifically for your travel writing. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
"
"Rehefa manomboka asa fanoratana lahatsoratra momba ny fitsangantsanganana, inona amin’ireto fahaizana manaraka ireto no tokony hohatsaraina voalohany?","The correct answer is **A: Fanoratana bilaogy (Bilaogy fanoratana)**.

Here's why:

The prompt states that a good way to start writing travel articles is to gain experience blogging about travel.  Option A directly reflects this advice.  

While the other options are helpful (website building, sharing, and website creation), they are secondary to the actual writing skill itself. You need to be able to *write* engaging travel content *first*, before you can effectively build a website to host it, share it widely, or create a specific site.
"
Amin’ny toetrandro hoatran’ny ahoana no fahita matetika ny olan’ny kibo?,"The correct answer is **C: Toetrandro mafana**.

The text explicitly states: ""any amin’ny toetrandro mafana kokoa, dia sady mitombo haingana kokoa no miaina ela kokoa ivelan’ny vatana ny bakteria."" (in warmer climates, bacteria grow faster and live longer outside the body).  This indicates that food poisoning is more common in warm climates.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, mety hahatonga ny fiarovana amin’ny inona ny fisiany mandritra ny fotoana ela?","The correct answer is **B: Otrik’aretina ao an-toerana**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ao an-trano, noho ny fisian’ny otrik’aretina ao an-toerana, dia ambony ny taha hoe efa voaaro amin’izy ireny ianao.""  This translates to: ""At home, due to the presence of germs, you are already highly protected against them.""

The question asks what protects you during extended periods *away* from home. The text then contrasts this with the dangers of encountering new bacteria in unfamiliar environments.  The implication is that the protection from germs you have at home *doesn't* extend to these new environments, making ""otrik’aretina ao an-toerana"" (germs/bacteria) the most relevant answer.

Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tombony azo avy amin’ny fivahiniana ao amin’ny faritra Schengen?,"The correct answer is **A: Tsy mila fangatahana vizà maro** and **C: Tsy mila mandalo ireo toerana fanamarinana pasipaoro maro**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Tsy mila fangatahana vizà maro** is correct because the passage explicitly states that with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country.
*   **C: Tsy mila mandalo ireo toerana fanamarinana pasipaoro maro** is correct because the passage says that within the Schengen area, you don't need to pass through passport control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tsy mandany vola** is incorrect. While the Schengen visa simplifies travel, it doesn't eliminate all costs (e.g., visa application fees).
*   **D: Tsy mila pasipaoro** is incorrect.  The passage implies that you *do* need a passport, as it refers to Schengen visas and passport control."
Inona no tsy hita intsony ao amin’ny fasan’i Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Ny harena (The treasures)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tsy ao intsony ny harena be tao amin’ny fasana, fa nafindra tany amin’ny trano tahiry Egiptianina ao Kairo."" (The abundant treasures inside the tomb are no longer there, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.)

While the text mentions the head and arms are still present, the loss of the treasures is a key point. Therefore, the answer is D.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, toerana aiza any Vancouver no azo inoana indrindra fa tsy hahasarika ny mpivahiny mitandrina amin’ny vidin-javatra? ","The correct answer is **C: Nosy Bowen**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that Bowen Island is ""mora haleha amin’ny lakana taxi manara-potoana alaina ao amin’ny Nosy Granville ao afovoan-tanànan’i Vancouver"" (easily accessible by a timely taxi ferry from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver). This suggests it's a more affordable option compared to other places mentioned.
*   Whistler is described as ""lafo fiainana"" (expensive).
*   Sea to Sky Gondola is a specific activity, not a place.
*   While the text mentions Bowen Island as a getaway, it doesn't indicate that it is a more affordable option compared to Whistler.

Therefore, based on the information in the text, **Nosy Bowen** is the most likely place to attract visitors who want to be mindful of expenses."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, toerana iza no inoana indrindra fa hanome ho an’ny mpivahiny zavatra iainana miavaka rehefa mitsidika an’i Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Nosy Bowen**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly describes Bowen Island as offering a variety of activities for visitors, including kayaking, hiking, shopping, and dining. It is presented as a day trip or weekend getaway option.
* Whistler is mentioned as being expensive and known for its Winter Olympics, making it a more specific and potentially less accessible option for a general visitor seeking a broader range of experiences.
* Vancouver's downtown is not highlighted as a primary destination for unique experiences, but rather as a point of departure for travel to other locations.
* Granville Island is described as a taxi ride from downtown Vancouver, and not as a destination in itself offering a wide variety of experiences.

Therefore, based on the text, Bowen Island is the most likely place to offer a diverse and appealing experience for visitors to Vancouver."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, rahoviana ny mpivahiny no tokony hitsidika ny Riandrano raha toa ka mitady hahita mazava tsara azy?","The correct answer is **A: Novambra hatramin’ny Martsa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Amin’ny fahavaratra (Novambra hatramin’ny Martsa), ho avo kokoa ny habetsahan’ny rano ary ny ho dramatika kokoa ny rian-drano."" This translates to ""In the summer (November to March), the water level will rise and the river will be more dramatic.""  Therefore, November to March is the time when visitors would see the river at its best.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mahatsara ny mitsidika ny Riandrano Viktoria eo anelanelan’ny volana Novambra sy Martsa?","The correct answer is **C: Fahitana dramatika an’ilay Riandrano**.

The text states: ""Amin’ny fahavaratra (Novambra hatramin’ny Martsa), ho avo kokoa ny habetsahan’ny rano ary ny ho dramatika kokoa ny rian-drano."" (In the summer (November to March), the water level will be higher and the waterfall will be more dramatic.)
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy hasaina hatao rehefa mampiasa drone mba hangalana horonantsary?","The correct answer is **D: Maka horonantsary amin’ny toerana be olona izay tsy hahitana an’ilay drone**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Tsy mety ny mampanidina drône akaiky ny seranam-piaramanidinana ambonin’ny olona maro, na dia tsy voararan’ny lalàna izany amin’ny toerana misy anao."" This means it's unsuitable to film drones near crowded places, even if it's legally permissible elsewhere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mijery mialoha hoe inona no azo alaina horonantsary:** The text says to check what you *can* film. This is encouraged, not discouraged.
*   **B: Maka fahazoandàlana fanampiny:** The text implies that additional permits might be needed for drone use, so getting them is important.
*   **C: Mikaroka fahazoandàlana:** Similar to B, obtaining necessary permissions is encouraged.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, aiza ireo toerana tsara indrindra hakana horonantsary amin’ny alalan’ny drone?","The correct answer is **D: Any amin’ny toerana izay nahazoanao fahazoan-dalana mialoha**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states, ""Tsy mety ny mampanidina drône akaiky ny seranam-piaramanidinana ambonin’ny olona maro, na dia tsy voararan’ny lalàna izany amin’ny toerana misy anao."" (It is not appropriate to fly drones near airports above crowds of people, even if it is not prohibited by law in your location.) This highlights the need for permission.
* The passage emphasizes respecting privacy and following regulations.  Obtaining permission *before* flying a drone is the best way to ensure you're operating legally and respectfully.
* Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they describe *bad* or unsafe locations for drone operation.

Therefore, option D is the only choice that aligns with the passage's guidance on responsible drone use.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireo fanambarana momba ny fepetra fisoratana anarana ho an’ny fikarakarana visa no tsy marina?","The correct answer is **B: Ny firenena rehetra dia mitaky ny fisoratana eny anivon’ny tompon’andraikitra eny an-toerana (All countries require registration with local authorities)**.

The text explicitly states that registration is *not* a requirement in all countries. It mentions that in some countries, it's mandatory, but in others, it's only for those staying outside of their sponsor's homes.  Therefore, option B is incorrect.

Here's why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Mety tsy mila misoratra anarana ianao raha mipetraka amin’ny fiantranoan’ny mpizahatany (You may not need to register if you are staying with your sponsor)** - This is directly supported by the text.
*   **C: Mety hotakiana ny fandehanana any amin’ny biraon’ny fifindraminona (You may need to go to the immigration office)** - The text mentions this as a possibility.
*   **D: Any amin’ny toerana sasany, dia afaka mikarakara an’ilay fisoratana anarana ny trano fandraisam-bahiny eo-toerana (In some places, the local hotel can handle the registration)** - The text explicitly states this as a possibility.



"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy toerana mety halehan’ny mpizahatany mba hikarakarana ny fisoratana anarany?,"The correct answer is **C: Biraon’ny paositra eo an-toerana**.

Here's why:

The passage states that hotels in some countries handle registration. It also mentions needing to go to the police or immigration office in other cases.  There's no mention of the post office being relevant to the registration process described. Therefore, the post office is the *least* likely place a traveler would go for this purpose.
"
Iza no tsy hahazo tombony avy amin’ny firotsahana an-tsitrapo mandritra ny fanatanterahana dia?,"The correct answer is **B: Olona mitady karama ambony**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while volunteering offers many benefits (cultural understanding, meeting people, personal growth, etc.), it generally provides only a small stipend (karama kely).  Therefore, someone primarily seeking high pay would *not* benefit from volunteering. The other options align with the benefits described in the passage.
"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, nahoana ny firotsahana an-tsitrapo rehefa any ivelany no tombony ho an’ny mpivahiny manana mitandrina ny tetibolany?","The correct answer is **C: Indraindray dia omena ny trano sy sakafo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...asa an-tsitrapo dia manome trano sy sakafo ary misy vitsivitsy manome karama kely."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amin’ny ankamaroan’ny fotoana dia mahazo karama foana** - The text says ""misy vitsivitsy manome karama kely,"" not that it's always paid.
*   **B: Matetika ilay izy no mitondra ho amin’ny tolotr’asa** - While it *can* lead to job opportunities, the text doesn't emphasize this as a primary benefit for those managing a budget.
*   **D: Afaka manampy hahazoana fijery** - While the text mentions gaining new perspectives, it does not list as a primary benefit for those managing a budget.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mety hoheverina ho tsy mahazatra ho an’ny dia mankany Disney Land?","The correct answer is **C: Mandany ny fotoana rehetra amin’ilay dia ao amin’ny faritr’i Disney**.

Here's why:

The text states that a ""special"" visit to Disney World involves spending a whole week *inside* the Disney property. This is presented as a defining characteristic of the experience. The other options are part of the described trip, but not necessarily the ""special"" or noteworthy part that distinguishes a Disney World visit.
"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana momba ny tontolon'ny Walt Disney ireto no tsy marina?,"The incorrect statement is **A: Ny tapakila park-hopper dia azo afindra amin’ny mpivahiny hafa (Park-hopper tickets can be refunded to other visitors)**.

The text explicitly states that Disney *does not* allow refunds on tickets, even those purchased on platforms like eBay or Craigslist. Therefore, the idea that park-hopper tickets can be refunded to other visitors is false.

Here's why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: Misy fampiantranoana eo an-toerana (There is on-site management):** The text describes a structured visit with a stay in a Disney resort, implying management.
* **C: Misy fiara fitateram-bahoaka hitondrana an’ireo mpivahiny avy any amin’ny seranam-piaramanidina mankany amin’ilay toerana (Public transportation transports visitors from the airport to the location):** The text states that the ""standard"" trip involves using public transportation from the airport.
* **D: Ireo tapakila manakery andro maro dia hita matetika amidy amin’ny tranon-kala mpanao lavanty (Multi-day tickets are often found for sale on scalper websites):** The text specifically mentions tickets being sold on eBay and Craigslist.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona amin’ireto raharaha manaraka ireto no azo inoana indrindra fa tsy ho voaresaka amin’ny fiofanana manara-penitra na fanontana?","The correct answer is **A: Fiainana any an’ala**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that while many books and newspapers discuss life in war zones, there are *few* resources focused on the *specific* training needed for those visiting conflict zones.  The text details training in specific areas like infectious disease environments, first aid, and potentially using protective gear. While life in war zones *might* be touched upon, it's not the core focus of the described, specialized training. The other options (first aid, first aid treatment, and simulations) are directly mentioned as components of the training.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto lohahevitra manaraka ireto no inoana indrindra fa ho voaresaka ao amin’ny fiofanana manara-penitra?","The correct answer is **A: Fitsaboana vonjimaika**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that ""the training program will include many temporary treatments."" This makes it a directly mentioned element of the training.
* While the other options are mentioned, the text emphasizes that the training should be *intensive and detailed* about the **environment** (tontolo feno fankahalana), and the focus is on equipping individuals to deal with that environment.  Temporary treatments are a key component of that preparation.
* The text explicitly states that books and newspapers about ""life in the mountains"" are abundant, but information about ""conflict zones"" is scarce. This implies the training aims to fill that information gap, which would include understanding and addressing immediate health concerns (temporary treatments).



Therefore, **Fitsaboana vonjimaika** is the most likely topic to be covered in the intensive training described."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona ny safidy tsara indrindra mba tsy hisotroana rano maloto?","The correct answer is **B: Mividy rano anaty tavoahangy**.

Here's why:

* The text states that in some places, a one-minute boil is sufficient, while in others, it requires several minutes. It also mentions that if you have problems, you should buy bottled water from a reputable company.
* Option B directly addresses the concern of drinking contaminated water by suggesting the safest solution: buying bottled water.
* The other options are less reliable. Option A is not universally suitable as boiling time varies. Option C is only suitable for some situations. Option D doesn't address the problem of contamination directly.



Therefore, buying bottled water is presented as the most reliable method to avoid drinking contaminated water."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona no mety tsy ho vita mihitsy na dia ho an’ny mpilomano efa be traikefa aza?","The correct answer is **C: Milomano manohitra ny lalan'ny rano (Swimming against the current)**.

The text specifically states: ""Ny ankamaroan’ny fahafatesana dia nohon’ny faharerahana amin’ny filomanosana manohitra ny lalan'ny rano, izay mety tsy ho vita.""  This translates to ""The majority of deaths are due to being overwhelmed by swimming against the current, which may not be possible.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Milomano eo akaiky kelin’ny harambato (Swimming near the shore):** The text mentions waves returning to the shore, but it doesn't say swimming near the shore is impossible.
*   **B: Milomano amin’ny rano lalina (Swimming in deep water):** The text mentions waves forming in deep water, but it doesn't say swimming in deep water is impossible.
*   **D: Milomano manodidina ny onjan-dranomasina (Swimming around the waves):** The text doesn't address swimming around waves specifically.



"
Inona no tokony hataonao raha tratra ao amin’ny lalan’ny rano ianao?,"The correct answer is **A: Miezaka miala amin’ilay tosiky ny rano ka mikendry lalana hafa, ary avy eo milomano hoatran’ny mahazatra miverina eny amin’ny torapasika.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the danger of being caught in the backwash.** It states that the backwash can trap you and make escape difficult.
* **Option A aligns with the advice to escape the backwash.** The passage suggests moving to a different path and then swimming back normally.
* **Option B is dangerous.** Swimming faster against the backwash will likely exhaust you.
* **Option C is not the most effective.** Swimming in the opposite direction might not get you out of the backwash and could lead you further from safety.
* **Option D is impractical and dangerous.** Swimming underwater is not a viable escape strategy and could lead to drowning.



Therefore, option A is the safest and most logical course of action based on the information given."
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, amin’ny toerana aiza ny fitsidihana rova no mety ho fitsangantsanganana tsara ialan-tsasatra?","The correct answer is **C: Ao amin’ny lohasahan’i Rhine**.

The passage states: ""Mety ho toerana tsara azo ialan-tsasatra ny lalandrano anatiny. Ohatra hoe mitsidika ny rova any amin’ny lohasahan’i Loire, ny lohasahan’i Rhine..."" (Inland waterways are good places for relaxing holidays. For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley...).  This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tanàna eny manaraka ny Danube:** The passage mentions visiting cities along the Danube, but not specifically as a *castle* visit in a relaxing holiday context.
*   **B: Eo akaikin’ny lakandrano Erie:**  While the passage mentions traveling along Lake Erie, it doesn't specifically connect it to castle visits.
*   **D: Eny akaikin’ny lalandrano anatiny tsy an-kanavaka:** This is too general. The passage provides specific examples, not a blanket statement.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy ho soso-kevitra homena ny vehivavy mivahiny ao amin’ilay faritra?","The correct answer is **D: Tsy manaiky lembenana rehefa ilaina izany**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly encourages women to stand up to men and to be assertive, even if there are cultural differences. Option D, ""Tsy manaiky lembenana rehefa ilaina izany"" (Don't accept condescension when necessary), directly aligns with this encouragement to stand up for oneself and not tolerate disrespect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tsy miresaka momba ny sokajy misy azy mahakasika ny fanambadiana** (Don't talk about your marital status): The text *does* discuss marital status as a factor women might be asked about.
*   **B: Mahafantatra fa ny fahasamihafana ara-kolontsaina dia mety hiteraka fihetsika manery avy amin’ireo mponina eo an-toerana** (Be aware that cultural differences may lead to coercive behavior from locals): This is something the text *specifically* warns about and encourages women to be prepared for.
*   **C: Tsy manao firavaka manintona maso** (Don't dress provocatively): While the text encourages women to be assertive, it *doesn't* explicitly mention dress code or avoiding provocative clothing. It focuses more on behavior and standing up for oneself.



Therefore, the only option that contradicts the text's core message of assertiveness is D."
"Araka ilay faritra vaosoritsoritra ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, inona ny torohevitra mahasoa ho an’ny mpandeha vehivavy?","The correct answer is **D: Raha toa ka misy manadala anao kanefa tsy ekenao izany, dia mijoroa amin’ny fandavana lehilahy.**

Here's why:

* The text specifically advises women to stand their ground and not be afraid to assert themselves, regardless of cultural differences. Option D directly reflects this advice regarding unwanted attention.
* Option A is not a helpful advice. The text actually warns that being perceived as a married woman might attract unwanted attention.
* Option B is a bit misleading. The text advises on doing a ""peratra"" (a type of bracelet), but clarifies it shouldn't be overly expensive and highlights the importance of women understanding potential cultural misinterpretations.
* Option C is completely contradictory to the main message of the text. It says that cultural differences mean you *shouldn't* stand up for yourself.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate reflection of the travel advice given in the excerpt.

"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, iza amin'ireto trangan-javatra ireto no mety hitakiana amin’ny mpakasary bibidia iray ny mba hampiasany masom-pakantsary voatokana?","The correct answer is **A: Raha toa izy ireo ka maka sary zavamananaina kely bilitika**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Betsaka ireo biby tsy mahazatra no sarotra hita, ary indraindray ireo valanjavaboary mametraka fitsipika momba ny fakàna sary noho ny antony ara-barotra. **Raha toa ny zavamananaina kely bilitika** no alain’ary mila objectifs hafa.""

This indicates that specialized lenses are needed to photograph small, fast-moving animals.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra hoe mety ho fanamby ho an’ny mpaka sary bibidia?,"The correct answer is **C: Mahazo ny karazana objectif ilaina**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that while telephoto lenses are often needed, different lenses are required for birds in flight or small, quick animals. This implies the need to obtain the *right* lenses, not just *any* lenses.
* The text does mention the challenges of photographing rare animals (A) and dealing with potentially aggressive animals (B).
* The text mentions challenging environments (D) which can be cold, hot, or inaccessible.

Therefore, option C is the *least* supported by the text. The text acknowledges the *need* for the right lenses, but doesn't specifically say that obtaining them is a challenge or a requirement for success. The other options are all directly mentioned or strongly implied in the text.
"
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no inoana indrindra fa tsy hiteraka olana ho an’ny mpitondra fiara mandeha any an-tendrombohitra?,"The correct answer is **A: Fifamoivoizina be**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that travel *does* continue throughout the year, despite the challenges.** This implies that despite the difficulties mentioned (icy roads, rain, poor visibility), transportation *does* happen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ambany ny fikasohana (Low visibility):**  The passage explicitly mentions low visibility due to ice and rain.
* **C: Fitsonihana be loatra (Heavy snowfall):** The passage states that heavy snowfall can limit visibility and travel.
* **D: Fahitana voafetra (Limited visibility):**  The passage directly states that visibility can be limited by snow, rain, or car spray.



Therefore, the only option that the passage implies *doesn't* typically cause problems is the ongoing flow of traffic itself.



"
Inona no inoana fa hijanona hitovy foana manerana ny firenena samihafa raha ny mahakasika ny hetra amin’ny fidiram-bola?,"The correct answer is **A: Taha (Tax rate)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ny hetra amin’ny fidirambola dia voarafitra amin’ny fomba samy hafa arakaraka ny firenena ka ny tahany sy ny fizarany dia tena tsy mitovy arakaraka ny firenena."" This means the *tax rate* is the element that varies significantly between countries.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rafitra (System)**: While the tax system itself differs, the question asks what *stays the same*.
*   **C: Aiza ianao no mandoa azy (Where you pay it)**:  The passage mentions payment locations (federal/provincial in the US/Canada), but this isn't a constant.
*   **D: Fetra ambany sy ambony (Lower and upper limits)**:  These limits change from country to country and are not consistent.



"
"Araka ilay sombin-dahatsoratra, raha toa ianao ka miasa any ivelany kanefa mipetraka any an-toeran-kafa, aiza ianao no inoana fa handoa ny hetra alaina amin’ny fidiram-bola?","The correct answer is **C: Ao amin’ilay firenena iasanao amin’izao**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Any amin’ny firenena federaly sasany, tahaka an’i Etazonia sy Canada, ny hetra amin’ny vola miditra dia alaina eny amin’ny ambaratonga federaly sy eny ifotony..."" This indicates that the tax is levied in the country where you *work*. While the place of residence can influence things, the primary tax obligation for income earned in another country falls on that country's tax system.  Option A is incorrect because the text specifies federal and local taxes. Option B is only a specific example (USA). Option D is irrelevant as the tax amount isn't tied to the lowest rate.
"
Iza amin’ireto fanambarana ireto no tsy manoritsoritra marina ny Foara manerantany iray?,"The correct answer is **D: Tsy voatery mandray anjara ireo firenena** (Countries are not necessarily required to participate).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ny firenena mandray anjara dia maneho zava-kanto sy seho fanabeazana ao amin’ny sehatra nasionaly..."" (Participating countries showcase culture and educational exhibits in a national setting...). This implies participation *is* required.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

* **A: Ny fampirantiana dia mety hampiseho ny tantara na kolontsain’ny firenena iray** (The fair may showcase the history or culture of a country) - The text explicitly states this: ""...ny kolontsaina sy tantaran’ny fireneny"" (...its culture and history).
* **B: Ny fampirantiana bôtanika dia aseho miaraka amin’ny fampirantiana zava-kanto sy fanabeazana** (Botanical fairs are displayed together with cultural and educational exhibits) - The text specifically mentions a ""Foara manerantany bôtanika"" (International Botanical Fair) being part of the larger fair.
* **C: Ny hetsika dia mety haharitra hatramin’ny enim-bolana** (The event may last up to six months) - The text says: ""...mety haharitra hatramin’ny tokony ho izy, ary atao eny amin’ny toerana izay tsy latsaky ny 50 hektara."" (...may last, and take place in a location of at least 50 hectares). This implies a duration of up to six months is possible.



Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the provided text is D."
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no fitsipiky ny Foara manerantany na Fampirantiana Manerantany?,"The correct answer is **A: Ny fampirantiana dia sady tokony hampiseho ny tantaran’ny firenena iray no sady mampiseho ny olana iraisam-pirenena.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ny firenena mandray anjara dia maneho zava-kanto sy seho fanabeazana ao amin’ny sehatra nasionaly **mba hanehoana olana iraisam-pirenena na ny kolontsaina sy tantaran’ny firenen’ny**.""  This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ny firenena iray dia tsy mahazo mamerina mampiantrano an’ilay hetsika isan-taona:** The text says these events *could* happen annually, although they rarely do. It doesn't prohibit a country from hosting it more than once.
* **C: Ny hetsika dia tsy maintsy maharitra enim-bolana:** The text states the event *usually* lasts three to six months. It doesn't say it *must* be that long.
* **D: Mba hampisy an’ilay foara dia tsy maintsy mandray anjara ny firenena rehetra:** The text mentions that countries *participate* but doesn't require *all* countries to participate for the event to exist.

Ny fanaovana an’iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no hampihena ny mety ho fanafihan’ny biby?,"The correct answer is **C: Mijanona 25 metatra miala ny amboadia**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Araka izay nolazain’ny mpitantana ny valanjavaboary, mijanòna fara-fahakeliny 100 metatra miala ny bera sy ny amboadia ary 25 metatra kosa amin’ireo bibidia hafa rehetra!"" (According to the zoo manager, you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and hippos and at least 25 meters away from all other animals!)
* **The text warns:** ""Na hoatran’ny hoe tsara fanahy aza ny fijery ny omby, ny ombimanga ny bera, ary ny ankamaroan’ny biby lehibe dia mety hanafika."" (Even if you are well-intentioned to watch the cows, the hippos, and the majority of the large animals, they may attack.) Staying the recommended distance is a key preventative measure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mitondra zava-maitso manitra (Bring fragrant things):** The text specifically advises *against* this because it attracts animals.
* **B: Manala ny fako eo amin’ny toerana ilasiana (Remove trash from the area):** While good practice, it's not the *primary* way to prevent animal attacks. The text focuses on maintaining distance.
* **D: Mampiala ny biby amin’ny alalan’ny ambin-tsakafo (Feed the animals through the fence):** The text *explicitly* warns against this as it encourages animals to associate humans with food and become bolder.



Therefore, **C** is the best answer because it directly addresses the recommended safety distance from potentially dangerous animals."
Iza amin’ireto manaraka ireto no tsy voalaza ao amin’ilay sombin-dahatsoratra hoe mety ho anton’ny fanafihan’ny bibidia?,"The correct answer is **D: Biby izay tsy zatra olombelona (Animals that are not used to humans)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that animals in the zoo are *accustomed* to humans, and they only approach people on certain days. 
* The text emphasizes the importance of maintaining distance to avoid attacks, and mentions that many injuries occur because visitors don't respect the recommended distance.
* The text does mention the other options as reasons for potential attacks:
    * **Fofona mahery (Strong smells):**  Mentioned as something visitors should avoid.
    * **Tsy fanajana elanelana (Not respecting distance):**  The primary reason cited for injuries.
    * **Manome sakafo ny bibidia (Feeding the animals):**  Strongly discouraged.

Therefore, the text *doesn't* say that the reason for potential attacks is that the animals are *not* used to humans.  Quite the opposite, they *are* used to humans, which is why they can approach on certain days.
