Ibsa armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee yaalii PALM sirriitti kan ibsu kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Akka qorannoon agarsiisutti faayidaan inni kennu kan dura yaadamee olitti dha (According to the studies shown, the benefit it provides is greater than previously thought.)**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that while Ebola treatments have been developed, none have been shown to be effective for other illnesses.
* It then highlights that Zmapp, initially considered a potential treatment for Ebola, is now being shown to have significantly more benefit than originally anticipated.
* Option A directly reflects this key point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qorichi to’annoo yaalii kanneen biroo sadan waliin yeroo wal bira qabamu, isaan keessa tokko ZMapp (The studies of three other vaccine candidates were conducted together, one of which is ZMapp.)** While the passage mentions Zmapp being part of a study with other candidates, this isn't the main point about Zmapp's benefit.
* **C: ZMapp akka bu’uura yaalichaatti fayyada (ZMapp has benefit as a vaccine.)** The passage primarily discusses Zmapp's benefit as a treatment, not specifically as a vaccine.
* **D: Haala durii yaaluuf bu’a qabeessa ta’uun isaa agarsiifameera (Its effectiveness has been shown for the initial stage of the illness.)**  The passage doesn't focus on Zmapp's effectiveness at any particular stage of Ebola, but rather on its broader potential benefits beyond initial expectations.



"
Qorattoonni chiipsiin inni haaraan eessatti baay’ee jijjiirama fiduu akka danda’u yaadani?,"The correct answer is **B: Biyyoota sooressootatti (Developing countries)**.

Here's why:

The text states the scientists are focusing on diseases prevalent in developing countries like cancer, malaria, HIV, and other tropical diseases. They are specifically aiming to use this technology to diagnose these diseases in these regions. Therefore, the study's focus is on developing countries.
"
Meeshaa yaalaa hojjechuuf mala akkamii fayyadamu?,"The correct answer is **B: Maxxansituu inkijeeti istaandardii** (Standardized inkjet printing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Waan xiqqaa maxxanfamuu danda’uu kan maxxansituu inkjeeti fayyadamuun maxxaansu kan tokkon tokko isaanii saantimaa U.S tokko ta’uu malaa.""  This directly translates to: ""One of their prints is standardized inkjet printing, and it can also print very small things.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saantimaa U.S tokko tokkoof** (One US centimeter): This refers to the *size* of the print, not the method of printing.
*   **C: Chiipsii maxxanfamuu danda’u** (Printable chips): While the research *could* potentially use chips, the passage doesn't specify or imply that as the primary printing method.
*   **D: Meeshaa yaalaa kanneen biroo** (Other printing methods): The passage focuses on inkjet printing.

Therefore, the only option that aligns with the information provided in the passage is **B**.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, ibsi waa’ee loobeet iskaarpis sirrii hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **C: Sababa addeessi walitti galeef uumame ta’uu danda’a** (The reason for their formation could be the combination of sediments).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Scientists believe loes deposits formed from the accumulation of sediments, indicating that the area was subjected to intense erosion.  It also mentions this supports the theory of a largely static Earth.

* **Option C directly aligns with this:** The passage implies that the loes deposits are *evidence* of sediment accumulation, suggesting a combination of factors led to their formation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Taateen isaan uuman yeroo dhihootti uumamuu danda’a (They could have formed over a long period of time):** While the formation *likely* took a long time, the passage doesn't explicitly state this. It focuses on the cause (sediment accumulation) rather than the duration.
* **B: Argama isaanii jechuun addeessi dalagaa ji’oloojikii dhaba jechuu miti (Their appearance doesn't necessarily mean they are deep geological layers):** The passage *does* say their appearance (the layers) *indicates* erosion and the creation of geological layers. This option contradicts the passage.
* **D: Baay’een isaanii fuula addeessaa irratti kan argaman mitii (Many of them are not found on the surface):**  The passage doesn't discuss the location of loes deposits (surface vs. underground).

Therefore, option C is the most accurate interpretation based on the information provided in the passage.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, bifa lafaa ilaalchisee tiyoorii kamtu sochiin ji’ooloojii addeessa irratti uumamu akka jiru agarsiisaa?","The correct answer is **B: Bifti lafaa yeroo dheeraa dura uumame.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Scientists studying the Earth's crust have found evidence of the Earth's surface being created by the accumulation of debris. This debris, along with geological formations, suggests that the Earth's surface has undergone significant changes over time.  The passage also mentions this theory aligns with the idea that the Earth as a whole doesn't have significant geological movement.

* **Option B directly reflects this:**  The accumulation of debris over a long period implies that the Earth's surface is old and has been gradually formed, not a recent phenomenon.  This aligns with the idea of a static Earth (no significant geological movement) suggested in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Addeessi suuta walitti galaa jiraachuu isaa (The debris is accumulating):** While debris *is* accumulating, the key point is *over a long time*.  Simply stating accumulation doesn't address the age of the Earth's surface.
* **C: Fuula addeessaa irratti bifa lafaa xiqqaa qofatu jira (Only a thin layer of Earth is on the debris surface):** The passage doesn't mention the thickness of the Earth's crust.
* **D: Bifti lafaa yeroo dhiyeenya kanatti uumame (The Earth's surface was created very recently):** This directly contradicts the passage's implication that the Earth's surface has changed significantly *over time* and aligns with a very old Earth.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, hanga himannaan dhiyaattutti maaltu heddumminaan hin jiraatu?","The correct answer is **A: Yaadota dabalataa (Additional thoughts/Considerations)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the lack of additional thoughts or considerations regarding the missing person's case. It highlights how the police and media are primarily focused on reporting the facts (the disappearance, the lack of evidence, the police's official statements) and not delving into potential alternative explanations or deeper insights. The professor's quote directly points to this issue: ""If journalists and the media only publish what is confirmed, they are paving a dangerous road."" This implies a lack of exploration beyond the established facts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maxxansa suuraa (News of the suicide):** The passage explicitly states there's no concrete evidence of suicide, so it's not the dominant theme.
*   **C: Marii ragoota ijaan arganii (Witness statements):** The passage mentions the lack of reliable witness statements as a problem.
*   **D: Maxxansa barruulee (Published documents):** The passage discusses official statements and documents, but the central concern is the *interpretation* and *depth* of coverage, not just the existence of documents.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, yeroo ammaatti adamsitoota siiliitif rakkoon maali dha?","The correct answer is **A: Haala qilleensaa baay’ee hamaa ta’e (The drought is very severe).**

The passage states: ""Cabbii isa nama cabsu irratti dabalee, haaloonni qilleensaa hamoon tattaaffiiwwan lubbuu baraaruu danqanii jiru."" This translates to: ""The crops are suffering from the drought, and the people are facing severe famine."" The passage then elaborates on how the drought has impacted the availability of seeds and other resources.

Therefore, the primary issue faced by the farmers is the severe drought.
"
"Haala cabbiitti dabalata, maaltu lubbu baraartota irratti dhiibbaa fida?","The correct answer is **B: Haala qilleensaa (The drought)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the drought is causing hardship for the farmers.
* It mentions that the cattle are dying and the farmers are facing challenges.
* The passage directly links the drought to the farmers' difficulties.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Hnqina dhiyeessii (Lack of investment):** While lack of investment *could* contribute to problems, the passage doesn't explicitly say it's the *primary* issue. The focus is on the drought.
* **C: Gargaarsa dhabuu (Loss of support):** The passage doesn't mention a lack of support.
* **D: Adamsitoota siilii (Silicium officials):** The passage mentions Pitman, a farmer, and his difficulties, but doesn't link the problems to Silicon officials. It mentions that his land has been barren for 15 years.



"
Rooberti ilaalcha kamiin mirkaneessuu irraa of qusate?,"The correct answer is **D: Mirga iccitii qabaachuu (Having personal knowledge/experience)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mirga iccitii dhuunfaa haalaan beekamu, isa murtoon Roo’ii irratti hundaa’etti akka amane illee mirkaneessee ture."" This translates to: ""His personal knowledge, which he knew in a natural way, he did not consider to be as important as the knowledge of the court.""

This directly indicates that Rooberti dismissed his own personal experience/knowledge in favor of the court's authority and the perceived wisdom of the court. Therefore, he distanced himself from his own personal knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dhimmoota naamusaa irratti mari’achuu (Discussing matters of honor):** The passage doesn't mention Rooberti's involvement in honor-related discussions.
*   **B: Bulchiinsa Mana Murtii Olaanaa barbaachisaa itti fufiinsaa qabaachisaa (The need to have the authority of the Supreme Court):** While the passage mentions the Supreme Court's authority, it's Rooberti who *disregarded* it, not something he embraced.
*   **C: Bakka itti jireenyi eegalu (Taking a place in the future):** This isn't mentioned in the context of Rooberti's actions.

Therefore, option D is the only one accurately reflected in the text.
"
Mata duree Rooberti irratti mari’achuun naamusa dhabuudha jedhee itti dhaga’amu isa kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Mirga Iccitii ifatti baasuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mirga iccitii dhuunfaa haalaan beekamu, isa murtoon Roo’ii irratti hundaa’etti akka amane illee mirkaneessee ture.""  This translates to: ""The personal truth, known in reality, was not acknowledged by him, even if it was based on the Roe decision.""

This indicates that Robertis's inability to acknowledge the personal truth (likely related to abortion rights) was a point of contention, and that his approach lacked transparency and honesty.  Therefore, **""Mirga Iccitii ifatti baasuu"" (bringing the truth to light/revealing the truth)** is the best fit for the phrase ""mata duree Rooberti irratti mari’achuun naamusa dhabuudha jedhee itti dhaga’amu isa kami?"" which asks what was considered a violation of Robertis's integrity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Bulchiinsi Mana Murtii Olaanaa Itti fufiinsa qabaachuu (The authority of the Supreme Court having ultimate power):** While relevant to the context of abortion rights, it doesn't directly address Robertis's personal integrity or the violation of it.
* **B: Murtoo Roe v. Wade (The Roe v. Wade decision):**  The passage mentions Roe v. Wade, but it's used as a *basis* for Robertis's reasoning, not as the core issue of integrity. The issue is *how* he used that basis.
* **D: Dhimmoota addaa (Current issues):** This is too general. The question is about a *specific* violation of integrity.



Therefore, the best answer is **C**.



"
Xiyyi ifaa lamaan eessatti calaqqisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Gara samiitti** (To the sky).

The text explicitly states: ""Xiyyaan ifaa lama halkan tokkoon gara iddoo samii kessatti diriiraniiru"" which translates to ""Two sunbeams are directed towards the sky from here.""
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, gamooleen samii tuqan yoom bakka sanatti ijaaraman?","The correct answer is **C: Halkan tokkotti (Here)**.

The text states: ""Sa’aatii 8:46 a.m. irratti cal’isuun magaalaa, yeroo murteessaa jeetiin galma isaa itti rukuteedha. Xiyyaan ifaa lama halkan tokkoon gara iddoo samii kessatti diriiraniiru."" This translates to: ""At 8:46 a.m., the town was awakened, and its prayers were turned towards the sky. Two lamps of light were placed here towards the sky.""

The phrase ""halkan tokkoon"" means ""here"". Therefore, the gathering of the people for the ceremony happened *here*.
"
Odeeffannoo kamtu Obboleettonni Torban Holqa ta’uu yaada kenna?,"The correct answer is **A: Garaagarummaa Teempireecharaa (Temperature variation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Suuraan infiraareedii akka agarsiisutti garaagarummaan teempireechara guyyaa fi halkanii akka holqaa ta’uu agarsiisa."" This directly translates to: ""As infrared imagery shows, temperature variation reveals the daily and seasonal cycles.""  The key indicator for identifying these ""Toast Rings"" is the temperature difference.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Diyaameetira seensa holqichaa (Diameter of the detecting sensor):** While the diameter is mentioned, it's not the *reason* they're called ""Toast Rings.""
* **C: Qorannoo Ji’ooloojikaal (Geological survey):** A geological survey is a broader study and not the specific observation that defines the Toast Rings.
* **D: Suuraa Holqawwan lafa irraa (Imagery of surface waves):**  While surface waves might be part of the Earth's activity, the passage connects the ""Toast Rings"" specifically to temperature variation.



"
Amalli ho’iinsa Obboloota Torbaa akkamiin ilaalame?,"The correct answer is **A: Suuraa infiraareedii (Infrared imagery)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Suuraan infiraareedii akka agarsiisutti garaagarummaan teempireechara guyyaa fi halkanii akka holqaa ta’uu agarsiisa."" which translates to ""As shown by infrared imagery, it reveals the daily temperature variation and how it heats up and cools down.""
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, ibsi waa’ee shakkiichaa sirrii hin taanee kami?","The correct answer is **C: Saba eessaa akka ta’e aangawootaan beekameera (The ethnicity of the person was known by the authorities).**

Here's why:

The passage states the person was identified as Uyghur *after* being arrested. This implies the authorities didn't initially know their ethnicity.  The passage emphasizes the false accusation of a bomb, leading to the arrest.  The ethnicity being known by authorities *after* the arrest is the element that is suspicious and likely incorrect based on the narrative.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Yeroo haleellaa konkolaataa fayyadame (The bomb was used at a busy time):** While details about the timing are present, the core issue isn't the timing itself, but the validity of the claim.
* **B: Meeshaa dhohu hidhatee dhoose (The mustache grew and then was shaved):** This is a detail about the person's appearance and while interesting, isn't the central point of the suspicious aspect of the story.
* **D: Miidhaan irra hin geenye (The bomb didn't explode):**  The fact the bomb didn't explode is what *caused* the person's arrest, but it doesn't make the ethnicity identification reliable.  It's the *process* of identifying their ethnicity that's questionable.



Therefore, the most suspicious element is that the authorities identified the person's ethnicity (Uyghur) only *after* arresting them.



"
Waa’ee haleellichaan wal qabatee aanga’oonni odeeffannoo maalii mirkaneessani?,"The correct answer is **D: Maqaa fi maqaa abbaa shakkamaa (Name and father's name of the suspect)**.

The text explicitly states that the suspect's name is now being shouted by the authorities, and that his identity as a Uyghur is known. This implies that his name and father's name were key pieces of information used by the intelligence agencies.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Eenyummaa nama isa waliin hojjetu kamiyyu (Any person who works with the suspect)** - While related, this isn't the core piece of information mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Sabummaa nama shakkamee (The suspect's characteristics)** -  The text doesn't specify any particular characteristics, only his ethnicity and name.
*   **C: Kaka’umsa haleellaa kana dugda duuba jiru (The origin of this news is underground)** - This refers to the source of the information, not the information itself.



"
Garee kamtu tapha Paarkii Ellistti godhamu irratti taphata?,"The correct answer is **A: Gurraacha Hundaa fi Awustiraaliyaa**.

The text states: ""Taphni dhumaa dorgommii walitti aanaa kan inni geggeffamuu Elis Paark Johanisbargitidha turban dhufuu, gaafa Springboks Awustiraaliya wajjin taphatu."" This translates to: ""The final match of the tournament, which was held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, took place after Springboks played against Australia.""
"
Ispiringibuuksii tapha isaanii itti aanu eessatti taphatu?,"The correct answer is **A: Awustiraaliyaa**.

The text states: ""Taphni dhumaa dorgommii walitti aanaa kan inni geggeffamuu Elis Paark Johanisbargitidha turban dhufuu, gaafa Springboks Awustiraaliya wajjin taphatu."" This translates to ""The final match of the tournament was held at Ellis Park Johannesburg, after Springboks played against Australia.""
"
Buufatni hawaa yeroo ergamaa kanneen armaan gadii keessaa isa kam irratti rakkoon isa mudate?,"The correct answer is **A: Furgugsiistota irraa fageenya sirrii irratti argamuu (Obtaining accurate data from the navigators)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Chi’aawoo fi Shariipov furgugistoota sirreessa ilaalchaa irraa fageenya gaariirra akka jiran gabaasan."" This translates to ""Chi'awoo and Sharipov, navigators, reported that there was no accurate data.""  The problem arose with the data coming from the navigators (furgugistoota).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jiirooskooppii eeggachuu (Waiting for the gyroscope):** The text says the gyroscope was already functioning correctly (""buufataa hawaa irratti dhabu iyyuu bakka isaa tursiiseera"" - it was only displaced from its place on the air intake). It wasn't the problem.
* **C: Jeetii dammaqsuu (Engine malfunction):** The text mentions the engine was functioning correctly (""To’annaan lafaa Raashiiya jeetii dammaqsee ilaalcha yagguu buufataa deebisee argate"" - The Russian icebreaker, after testing, returned the air intake data). The engine's functionality isn't the problem.
* **D: Irra deebiin ol fageenya sirrii argachuu (Obtaining accurate data from the icebreaker itself):** While the icebreaker *eventually* returned accurate data, the *initial* problem was with the data the navigators provided.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kaayyoon ergama buufata hawaa maali?","The correct answer is **A: Jiirooskooppii bade argachuu (To obtain a new gyroscope)**.

The passage states: ""Hamma dhuma deemsa hawaatti buufatichi jiirooskooppii dursa ergama buufataa hawaa irratti dhabu iyyuu bakka isaa tursiiseera"" which translates to ""The airship's main purpose, the airship's first airborne messenger, was to retrieve a gyroscope"". 

The passage also mentions that Chi'awoo and Sharipov are looking for a gyroscope. Therefore, the main goal of the airship was to obtain a new gyroscope.
"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee dhimmichaa irratti dhugaa kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **D: AOL himatameera**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Dhimmichi, bakka itti argama kaampaanii AOL waan ta’eef Verjiiniyaatti mana murtiitti dhiyaate.""  This translates to ""Dhimma (spam), because the company AOL was the one that was targeted, filed a lawsuit in Virginia.""  Therefore, AOL was the target of the spam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naannoo waajjira muummee AOL qabu keessatti himatame:**  The text doesn't specify *where* the spam was targeted within AOL. It simply says AOL was the company targeted.
* **B: Murtiin murtaa’eera:** This is simply stating the lawsuit happened and doesn't explain *who* was targeted.
* **C: Dhimma kana keessatti seera Ispam imeelii ilaalchisee bahe fayyadameera:** While the spam law is mentioned as a result of the incident, the text focuses on AOL being the initial target.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa dhimmicha sirriitti kan ibsu kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhimmichi bara 2003tti himatamee ture.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kuni murtoo yakkamtummaa yeroo jalqabaatiif seera bara 2003tti ii-meeyilii saaxoo, kan ispaam jedhamuun illee beekamu..."" (This was the beginning of spam, a type of email not yet known as spam, which was sent from unknown sources using hojiirra oole to be accepted). This directly links the beginning of spam to the year 2003.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL raabsa hin barbaadamneen himatame:**  While AOL was a platform for the emails, the passage doesn't say they were sent *without* AOL's permission. It talks about the emails being sent from unknown sources *using* AOL's infrastructure.
* **B: Dhimmichi dhiyessitoota tajaajila intarneetaa adda duree lama hirmaachisa:** The passage only mentions AOL as the internet service provider involved.
* **D: AOL himata waa’ee dhimmichaa eegale:** The passage describes AOL's infrastructure being *used* to send spam, not AOL actively *creating* it.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, Viidaal bara dorgommii sadii dura kilabii kamiif taphachuu jalqabe?","The correct answer is **A: Seeviilaa**

Here's why:

The question asks where Vidal started playing for a club 4 years *before* arriving in Barcelona. The text states he went from Sevilla to Barcelona 4 years ago. Therefore, he started playing for Sevilla 4 years before that move.
"
Vidal Baarsaaf tapha meeqa taphate?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**

The question states: ""Erga magaala guddaa Kaatalaanitti darbaani, Viidaal kilaabii isaaf taphaa 49 taasisee."" which translates to: ""After arriving in the big city of Catalonia, Vidal's club gave him 49 goals.""
"
Tapha kana irratti gareen morkataa eenyufa dha?,"The correct answer is **B: Boloni’a**.

The passage states: ""Dorgommii Bolooniyaa waliinii Dilbataaf karoorfamee jiru dursee hootela garechaa keessa taa’aa ture."" This translates to: ""Before the trial in Bologna, Dilbataf stayed in a hotel owned by the same group.""

Therefore, the group mentioned is linked to Bologna.
"
Jaarkuye maaliif hoteela keessa ture?,"The correct answer is **C: Gaafa dilbataa tapha qaba ture**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hooteela gartichaa keessa ture tapha Dilbataaf karoorfamee kan Boloonyaa wajjinii dursee."" This translates to ""He was in the hotel where the Dilbataaf was killed in Bologna.""  Therefore, he was in the hotel *because* the Dilbataaf (a person) was killed there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shaakala qaba ture (He had a secret/plan):** While he might have had a plan, the text directly links his presence in the hotel to the Dilbataaf's death.
*   **B: Walgahii bara dorgommii duraa qaba ture (He had a connection from before the conflict):** The text only mentions a connection with Bologna, not a broader history.
*   **D: Bolonia waliin shaakala irra ture (He had a secret with Bologna):** Similar to A, the text doesn't explicitly state a secret connection.



"
Maaliif eejansiin ji’oofiiziksii Jaakartaa akeekkachiisa hin kennine?,"The correct answer is **A: Balaan suunaami hin jiru ture**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""sababni isaas kirkirri sun haal-duree barbaadamu guddina 6.5 hin guutne."" (The reason is that the recent earthquake did not reach a magnitude of 6.5).  The earthquake being below that magnitude means a tsunami was not generated. The agency wouldn't issue a tsunami warning if one wasn't likely.

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **B: Jiraattota naannoo gidduu rifuu hambisuuf** (To evacuate residents of the central region): While evacuation might be a standard procedure, the text doesn't suggest this was the reason for *not* issuing a warning.
*   **C: Dhiibbaa inni daldaloota giddu galeessaa irratti fidu hambisuuf** (To mitigate the impact of the flood on the central banks): The text doesn't mention floods or banks.
*   **D: Ulaagaa hanga kirkira uumuu danda’uu hin guutu** (The ability to generate a seismic wave is not fulfilled): This is a nonsensical option in the context of the text. The text is about the earthquake's magnitude, not the agency's ability to generate waves.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kirkirri maal fida?","The correct answer is **D: Iskeeliidhaan hanga 6.5 ta’uu danda’a**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""sababni isaas kirkirri sun haal-duree barbaadamu guddina 6.5 hin guutne.""  This translates to: ""The reason for this is that the earthquake's magnitude did not exceed 6.5.""

Therefore, ""kirkirri"" in this context refers to the earthquake's magnitude, and it's important to know that it's considered too low to cause a tsunami. Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jiraattota naannoo rifachiisuu** (To evacuate the population): While evacuation *might* happen in other tsunami situations, it's not directly what ""kirkirri"" refers to in this passage. The text says people started to feel relieved *because* the earthquake was weak.
*   **B: Balaa suunaamii** (Tsunami disaster): The text explicitly says no tsunami was produced.
*   **C: Akeekkachiisa kennuu** (To provide a warning): The text doesn't mention warnings.



"
Isaan keessaa isa kamtu sochii Aduu fi urjiilee biroo hunda kakaasa?,"The correct answer is **A: Liyuminisitii fi yaa’aa pilaazmaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Liyuminisitii fi yaa’aa pilaazmaa waliin wal qabatu lakkoofsa urjii Roosbii murteessuuf oolu...""  This translates to: ""Luminosity and plasma emission are used to determine the energy level of the Roosbii number..."" and later ""Lakkoofsi Roosbii akka xiqqaatuun, hisatummaan urjichaa duubatti-deebisa maagineetii waliin wal bira yoo qabamu ni xiqqaata."" (The Roosbii number decreases, and the energy level decreases when coupled with magnetic field emission).

Therefore, luminosity and plasma emission are the ones that initiate the movement of Aduu and other energies.  While the Roosbii number and magnetic field emission are *related* to the energy level, they are not the *initiators* of movement.
"
Akkamiin lakkoobsi urjii Roosbii adda ba’a?,"The correct answer is **A: Liyuminisitii fi naanna’uu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Liyuminisitii fi naanna’uu wal faana gargaaramuun lakkoofsa urjii Roosbii murteessuuf oolu..."" which translates to ""The calculation of the Roeboe energy quantity relies on both Luminosity and radius.""
"
Namoota dhibbentaa meeqatu Awustiraaliyaan battalatti riippaablika akka taatu deeggara akka qoratametti?,"The correct answer is **B: dhibbentaa 29**.

The text states: ""Daari funaansa-sagalee sanatti, warraa sagalee kennan keessatti parsaantiin 29 kan ta’aan Awuustiraliyaan riipabliika ta’uu qabdi safiisa barbaadameen jedhuu..."" 

This translates to: ""In the survey, 29 percent of the people expressed a desire for Australia to become a republic...""
"
"Akka Juuliyaa Gilaarditti, Awustiraaliyaan yoom riippaablika taati?","The correct answer is **D: Filannoo federaalaa booda**.

The passage states: ""Haati Imaanaa Muummittiin Ministeeraa Juuliyaa Gilaardi yeroo duula na filadhaa filannoo federaalaa 2010 tti akka cimsitee dubbattetti dhuma mootummaa Giiftii Eelsaabex II tti Awustiraaliyaan rippaabiliika ta’uu qabdi jettee amanti."" This translates to: ""Foreign Minister Julia Gillard said that after the Federal election of 2010, the government of Queen Elizabeth II was urged to consider Australia becoming a republic.""

Therefore, according to Julia Gillard, Australia would become a republic *after* the Federal election of 2010.
"
Dhaabbata kamtu qorannoo seeraa jala jira?,"The correct answer is **A: Haawus Enerjii fi Koomersi Koomiitee**.

The text states: ""Istiirns gibirri karaa Warrummaa Karoorfamee deeggarsa ulfa baasuutiif oolaa jiraachuu fi dhiisuu isaa akka dura-ta’aa **To’annaa fi Qorannaawwan Koree-gadaanaa, isa gaaddisa Haawus Enerjii fi Koomersi Koomitii jala ooluutti qorataa jira.**"" This translates to ""Istiirns is working to ensure the successful and smooth continuation of the project by presenting reports and studies to the **House Energy and Commerce Committee**, led by the Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.""



"
Kiliif Stiirnis geggeessaa koree kamii dha?,"The correct answer is **D: Koree Cita To’annoo fi Qorannaawwan Koree-gadaanaa**.

The text states: ""Istiirns gibirri karaa Warrummaa Karoorfamee deeggarsa ulfa baasuutiif oolaa jiraachuu fi dhiisuu isaa akka dura-ta’aa **To’annaa fi Qorannaawwan Koree-gadaanaa** jala ooluutti qorataa jira."" This translates to: ""Istiirns is working to ensure the success and sustainability of the Korrofame Warra road, and is presenting **Korean-style studies and reports** on the Korean-style Warra road committee.""

Therefore, the Koree (study/report) being discussed is the Korean-style studies and reports.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, dubartii Iswiiz irratti maaltu hin raawwanne?","The correct answer is **A: Meesholeen ishee hataman deebifamaniiru** (Her belongings were returned).

The text states: ""Nuti namoota dubartii Iswiiz gudeedan shan to’annoo jala kan oolchinee fi bilbilaa fi laaptooppii ishee deebisneeraafi."" This translates to ""We searched the house of the Swiss woman and returned her phone and laptop.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ni ajjeefamte** (She was arrested): The text doesn't mention the woman being arrested. It focuses on the recovery of her belongings.
* **C: Namoota 5n miidhaan saalaa irra gaheera** (5 people attacked her): The text mentions 5 people named, but it doesn't say they attacked her.  It says they were suspects.
* **D: Bilbillii fi laapitooppin ishee hatameera** (Her phone and laptop were confiscated): The text says they *returned* her phone and laptop, not confiscated them.



"
Dhaabbata kamtu Badhaasa Taa’iwaan Itti fufiinsaa bara 2007 badhaafame?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states: ""garuu gabaan itti fayyadamtoota Koompitarii Laptopii jijjiramuu danda’aa fi ni jijjiramee badhaasa ASUS kan 2007 Taayiwaan keessatti badhaasa yeroo hundaa itti gaafatamaa Yuwan Riipablikaa Chaayinaa.""  This translates to: ""However, the main users of customizable laptops and those who customize them are ASUS's 2007 Taiwan-based flagship, which is always trusted in the People's Republic of China.""
"
Kompiitarri dhuunfaa ASUS Eee maali?,"The correct answer is **B: Laapitooppii (Laptop)**.

The text explicitly states: ""PC’n ASUS Eee, kan yeroo muraasa dura gadhifamee inis gatii kan qusatu fi haalota fayyadamaaf gaarii ta’ee, oduu ho’aa ta’ee ji’aa IT Tayipe 2007’ti.

This translates to: ""The ASUS Eee PC, which was recently launched and is affordable and good for using its features, is not a traditional PC, but a customizable laptop that ASUS, a Taiwanese company founded in 2007, is constantly improving.""

Therefore, it's clearly described as a laptop.
"
Sanada poostaa badeef itti gaafatamummaa kan fudhatu eenyu?,"The correct answer is **B: Jiraattota gartuu Obanazawa (Obanazawa residents)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Obanazawa residents started complaining after the post office started issuing new year cards without respecting local customs. The post office's actions led to complaints from both people and the media. Therefore, the residents are the ones directly affected by the change in card design and the source of the initial complaints.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hojjettoota mana poostaa (Post office employees):** While they might be involved in the process, the complaints originated from the residents.
*   **C: Mucicha (The postman):** The passage mentions the postman specifically as someone who filed a complaint, but the broader issue started with the residents' concerns.
*   **D: Miidiyaa (The media):** The media reported on the issue *after* the complaints started. They didn't initiate the problem.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, waa’ee sanada badeef eenyutu dhiifama gaafate?","The correct answer is **A: Jiraattota naannoo (Local residents)**.

The text states: ""Dhimmichi kan jalqabe Amajjii 1ffaa yeroo jiraattonni naannoo hedduunkaardiiwwan Waggaa Haaraa dhaabbatoo fi kan aadaa hin fudhanne jechuudhaan gara Obanazawatti iyyachuu jalqabanidha.""  This translates to ""The issue began on January 1st when local residents started to complain to Obanazawa because many people were refusing New Year's cards that were disrespectful and didn't respect customs.""

The text explicitly mentions that local residents were the first to raise the issue with Obanazawa.
"
Del Potro dhimma gatiittii isaa yoom furmaata itti kennuu qaba ture?,"The correct answer is **C: Yeroo teessuma lammaffaa (Second set)**.

The text states: ""Del Porto n carraa duraa kan qabu tuuta isa lamaffaa keessati ture, garuu erga 6-6 ga’anii booda kunumti iyyuu mala ittiin adda baasanbarbaade.""  This translates to ""Del Porto had a first set advantage, but after reaching 6-6, both players became very nervous.""  This indicates the crucial moment was during the second set (yeroo teessuma lammaffaa) when the tension mounted.  He lost that set and then went on to lose the match.
"
Sababiin cituu saqii jalqabaa maal ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Maaraayiin teessuma isaa jalqabaan injifatame (Maraini's tennis was initially defeated)**.

The text states: ""Maaraayiin teessuma isaa jalqaba dhabee sababa ergaa dhiirotni lamaan wal qixxaataniif kan teessumaa waliin qoodataanin booda."" This translates to ""Maraini's tennis was initially defeated because the two players fought each other after a while, and then they played together."" 

Therefore, Maraini's tennis was initially defeated. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the text doesn't suggest Del Potro or Maraini defeated each other later in the match. It focuses on the initial defeat and then them playing together.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti eerametti, addatti eenyutu dhukkubsattootatti saaxila ba’e?","The correct answer is **C: Aanga’oota Teeksaas (Texans)**.

The text states: ""Ooggantoota saniin dabaalamuun, nageenya uummataa eguudhaf tarkaanfiiwwan fudhatamaa akka turan lammiilee Teeksaasiif mirkaneesse."" This translates to: ""The shootings have shaken the peace of mind of the people of Texas, hoping that the measures taken would be effective."" 

Therefore, the shootings have shaken the *people of Texas*. The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, bulchaan kun yeroo lammiilee Teeksaasiif haasaa godhu mirkaneessa akkamii hin kennine?","The best answer is **B: Haalonni nageenya hawwaasaa eeguuf dalagamaa akka jiran** (The leaders are urging the people to maintain peace and security).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the leaders' efforts to reassure Texans and maintain order.** Governor Perry emphasizes the need for unity and highlights the long-standing relationship between the state and the affected communities. 
* **The phrases ""nageenya uummataa eguudhaf tarkaanfiiwwan fudhatamaa akka turan lammiilee Teeksaasiif mirkaneesse"" and ""Sirni keenya hanga hojjechuu qabu hojjechaa akka jiru isiniifan mirkaneessa"" directly indicate that the leaders are urging people to remain calm and maintain peace.**
* **The other options are less accurate:**
    * **A: Sirnichi sirnaan akka dalagaa jiru (The system is acting as a shield):** While the system *should* provide security, the passage doesn't explicitly describe it as a shield.
    * **C: Rakkoo kana dandamachuuf hidhatanii jiru (They are striving to achieve this right):** The passage focuses on maintaining peace *in the face of* the situation, not necessarily on achieving a specific right.
    * **D: Dhimmichi kan nama yaaddessu miti (The problem is not intimidating):** This is a direct contradiction to the gravity of the situation, which the leaders are acknowledging.

Therefore, option B most accurately reflects the message conveyed in the passage about the leaders' attempts to reassure and encourage the people.



"
Maddi oduu nama bohaarsuu barattoota UW duraanii lamaan kalaqame kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Agarsiisa Guyyaa guyyaa** (The Daily Show).

The text explicitly states: ""Yeroo UW barataaa turan 1988’tti, Heeki fi Joonsan maxxansa oduu ba’eessa godhuu-fi gabaasa oduu mul’ata godhatanii turani—Agarsiisa Guyyaa guyyaa."" (In 1988, while they were students at UW, Heeki and Joonsan started a news satire show—The Daily Show.)

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa impaayera oduu bohartii Qullubbii adii keessatti kan hin dabalamne?","The correct answer is **A: Atilaasii addunyaa**.

The text explicitly states that the organization partnered with ""Aawur Daambi Woorildi jedhamun beekamu waliin ture"" which translates to ""was with the well-known world atlas called Aawur Daambi Woorildi"".  The other options (film, marsariitii, maxxansa waraqaa) are mentioned as things they *did* (films, leaflets, and the mention of leaflets being distributed to viewers) but not as something they partnered *with* or included in their offerings in this specific context.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, poolisiidhaan kan eegamaa ture maali?","The correct answer is **A: Marfata Trafalgar**.

The text explicitly states: ""Naanoo 11:29’tti, hiriirri gara Whitehall’tti ol deeme, marfata Trafalgar darbee..."" (Around 11:29, the procession rose from Whitehall, passing Trafalgar Square...)
"
Poolisiin sa'aatii meeqatti mormitoonni cinqii sochii akka hin uumneef akka isaan bakkaa socho'an gaafatee?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 tti**.

The text states: ""11:20 irratti poolisiin hiriirtotni akka dubatti deebi’an gaafate, haala sochii tiraafikaa walirra tuulamuufi mirga hiriiruusaanii waliin madalchiisuun akka irraa eegamu itti himuudhaan.""  This translates to: ""At 11:20, the police asked drivers to return and to cooperate in managing traffic and coordinating the movement of emergency vehicles.""
"
Qorannoo Dr. Ihudi Urin taasifame keessatti kamtu dhugaa dha?,"The correct answer is **A: Bu’aan argame dhukkubsataaf fayidaa qabaachuu kan maluu yoo gosa dhukkuba sukkaaraa sadarkaa 1 kan duraanii waliin kan argamu ta’e dha.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Akkuma hayyuu warra kaanii, innis dhibeen shukkaaraa akka fayyu hin amanu, argannoon kuni namoota dhibee shukkaaraa akka fayyu hin amanu, argannoon kuni namoota dhibee shukkaaraa gosa 1 qabaniif faayidaa akka hin qabne yaadachiisa.""  This translates to: ""Like those people, we also don't believe in diabetes being cured, and this finding suggests that it may not be beneficial for people with type 1 diabetes.""  The key part is that the benefit found relates to *people who had pre-diabetes (sadarkaa 1 kan duraanii)*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hantuuti qorannoo kan duraani dhukkuba sukkaaraa qabani amma dhukkuba sukkaaraan hin qabani:** The text says the study *doesn't* support the idea of curing diabetes.  It suggests it might not be beneficial for those who *already have* type 1 diabetes.
* **C: Argannoon kun qoricha argamsiisuu akka danda'u abdii guddaa qaba:** While the findings are important, the text doesn't emphasize their overall significance.  The focus is on the specific benefit for those with pre-diabetes.
* **D: Hantuuti qorannoo sukkaara hin qabne muraasni yeroo ammaa dhukkuba sukkaaraan qabamanii jiru:**  The study doesn't focus on people who *currently* have diabetes. It's about the potential benefit for those who *had* pre-diabetes.



"
"Akkaataa ibsa kanaatti, shakkiin Dr. Ur maali?","The correct answer is **C: Yaada ogeessota biroo waa’ee talaallichaa irratti** (The opinion of other experts on the findings).

Here's why:

The passage states that Dr. Ur is skeptical of the findings because ""Akkuma hayyuu warra kaanii, innis dhibeen shukkaaraa akka fayyu hin amanu, argannoon kuni namoota dhibee shukkaaraa akka fayyu hin qabbe.""  This translates to ""Like those experts, he does not believe that diabetes can be cured, and these findings do not seem to benefit people with diabetes.""

Essentially, Dr. Ur is questioning the findings based on the opinions and beliefs of other experts in the field. He's not necessarily doubting the findings themselves, but rather whether they represent a real breakthrough or a claim that others have already dismissed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yoo argannichi namoota dhukkuba sukkaaraa gosa 1f baay’ee barbaachisaa ta’e** (The findings are very important for people with type 1 diabetes): While the passage implies the findings *aren't* that important, this option doesn't capture Dr. Ur's skepticism.
* **B: Yoo talaallichi kan danda’amu ta’e** (The findings are plausible): The passage directly states Dr. Ur *doesn't* think the findings are plausible.
* **D: Yoo hantuutonni qorannoo dhukkuba sukkaara hin qabne akkuma sanaan turan** (The participants in the study were the same as those who didn't have diabetes): This is irrelevant to Dr. Ur's doubt. The problem isn't who participated, but what the implications are.

Ibsa armaan gadii keessaa sirriitti caccabuu balaliinsa CG4684 kan hin ibsine isa kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Xiyyaarichi jalqabatti sababa haala qilleensaan qubachuu hin dandeenye** (The sheep initially couldn't jump due to the slippery condition).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Akka itti caccabe har’a argame; salphaatti immoo bira ga’amuun waan hindanda’amneef poolisoonni lama bakkicha miillaan akka deemanii namoota lubbuun hafa akka barbaadaniif daggala keessa buufaman.""  This translates to ""The place where it jumped was found; however, it was unclear how it got there, so two police officers were dispatched to investigate in case someone had attacked the animal.""  The reason for the unclear situation is the slippery surface.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xiyyaarichi lafa fagootti caccabe** (The sheep jumped over a fence): The passage doesn't mention a fence.
* **C: Xiyyaarichi osoo hin lafa hin caccabin dura yeroo sadii lafa qubachuuf yaale** (The sheep jumped five times before jumping without a fence): The passage doesn't say the sheep jumped five times.
* **D: Bakka itti xiyyaarichi caccabe argachuun sababa haala qilleensaan rakkiseera** (Finding the place where the sheep jumped caused trouble due to the slippery condition): While the slippery condition *caused* trouble, the initial reason *why* the sheep couldn't jump was the slippery surface.  Option A is a more direct and accurate reflection of the information.



"
Balallii CG4684 lafa qubachuu isaa akka dhiisu kan taasise maali?,"The correct answer is **A: Bakki qubatu sirriitti hin argamu (The place where it was shot is hidden).**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bakki itti caccabe har’a argame; salphaatti immoo bira ga’amuun waan hindanda’amneef poolisoonni lama bakkicha miillaan akka deemanii namoota lubbuun hafa akka barbaadaniif daggala keessa buufaman."" This translates to: ""The immediate area was found; however, the source was not found, so the police cordoned off the area and searched for people who had a motive.""

This indicates that the location of the shooting was not immediately apparent or easily identifiable, leading to the police needing to investigate further.  The other options aren't supported by the text:

* **B: Xiyyaaronni biroo hedduun xiyyaara CG4684 ni dursu (Other witnesses claimed to have seen CG4684 earlier):** The text doesn't mention other witnesses or their claims.
* **C: Xiyyaarichi gara Kokodatti kallattii isaa jijjiireeti (The witness's trajectory changed near Kokoda):**  The text only says the shooting happened near Kokoda, not that the trajectory changed.
* **D: Haalli qilleensaa mijataa miti (The wound condition is not serious):** The text doesn't provide information about the wound's severity.

"Ibsa kana bu’uureffachuun, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee muuxannoo Firansiiszeek Koowal kamtu dhugaa dha?","The correct answer is **D: Foddaa cabsuuf yeroo yaalutti miidhaan irra ga’eera.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fulleen foddaa tokko dhuma irratti cabnaan, karaa foddaa ba’uu eegalan.” This translates to ""A pile of dung was placed on the path, blocking the way of the dung."" This clearly indicates that Franzzek Kowal placed the dung on the path, implying he used a tool or method to do so.  Therefore, option D is the most accurate interpretation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Foddaa cabsuu danda’eera (He was able to block the dung):** While true, it doesn't explain *how* he blocked the dung.
* **B: Miidhaan isa irra hin geenye (His tool did not break):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about a tool breaking.
* **C: Bakkee ba’uuf yeroo yaalutti teessuma cabseera (He blocked the way while trying to go somewhere):** The passage doesn't specify his motivation for blocking the path. He simply *did* block it.



"
Maaliif dhiibbaa Obomboleettii Tiroopikaalii Daani’eel safaruun rakkoo ta’e?,"The correct answer is **C: Obomboleettiin sosocho’iinsa lafaa irraa fagoo dha.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Obomboleettiin sosocho’iinsa lafaa irraa fagoodha, Yuunayitid Iisteetsii fi Kaaribiyaanii irratti dhiibbaa cimaa inni qabu qorachuun rakkisaa ta’ee hafeera."" (The hurricane was moving away from land, causing a difficult situation in the United States and the Caribbean.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Obomboleettiin kun cimee gara haarikeeniitti guddate (The hurricane was still growing into a major hurricane):** While the text mentions scientists predicting it would intensify, the primary *reason* for the difficulty wasn't its growing strength, but its movement towards populated areas.
* **B: Saayintistoonni waa’ee qilleensa obomboleettii kanaa itti fufiinsa qabaachuun isaa kan mirkanaa’e miti (Scientists didn't predict its path):**  The text *does* say scientists predicted it would intensify.
* **D: Obomboleettiin kun Miyaamii irraa fagootti argama (The hurricane was seen moving away from Miami):**  The fact it was moving *away* from Miami wasn't the problem; the problem was where it was heading.



"
"Akkaataa Ibsa kanaatti, waa’ee Obomboleettii Tiroopikaalii Daani’eel dhugaa kan hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **B: Garba Atilaantikiitti uumame**.

The text explicitly states: ""Obonboleettichi, inni Maayaamii, Filooriidaa irraa timaamaan maayilii 3,000 irratti argamu, qilleensa hinjijjiiramne ol aanaa isaa sa’atiitti maayilii 40 (64 kph) qaba. Saayintistootni Giddugala Biyyaalessaa Hariikeen Daani’eel gaafa Roobi gara hariikeenitti akka jabaatu raajan.""  This translates to: ""The tropical cyclone, which was found 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, without a defined center, has a maximum wind speed of 40 mph (64 kph) per hour. Scientists at the National Hurricane Center have predicted that Hurricane Daniel will intensify into a hurricane."" And earlier, ""Obonboleettii Tiroopikaalii Daani’eel gaafa hariikeenitti akka jabaatu raajan."" which translates to ""Tropical Cyclone Daniel is predicted to intensify into a hurricane.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhiibbaa inni biyyoota Kaariibiyaaniitti fidu beekamaa miti** (Its danger to Caribbean countries is not known): The text says the cyclone posed a threat to the United States and the Caribbean.
* **C: Haarikeeniitti jijjiiramuu danda’a** (It can intensify into a hurricane): The text *states* it is predicted to intensify into a hurricane. This isn't a falsehood.
* **D: Sosocho’iinsa lafaatti dhiyoodha** (It destroys with its force): The text says it has wind speed, and can potentially cause destruction, but it doesn't state it *destroys* with its force. It simply mentions the wind speed and the prediction of intensification.



Therefore, the only statement presented in the text that is accurate is that the tropical cyclone formed in the Atlantic Ocean.

Here's why:

* The text states that the virus doesn't cause severe illness and that symptoms can be ""in between"" or mild. 
* It also mentions that people can continue working and interact with others even while infected, suggesting milder symptoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lubbuu kan hin balleessine ta’uu qaba (It might not be fatal):** While the text says it doesn't cause severe illness, it *doesn't* explicitly state it's not fatal. It just implies mildness.
* **C: Namoonni hedduun dhukkubichaan qabamuu qabu (Many people will get infected):** The text doesn't give information about the potential number of infections.
* **D: Ijoolleen mallattoo kana of irratti arguu qabu (Children might experience these symptoms):** The text doesn't specifically mention children.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate interpretation of the information provided in the text."

The text states: ""Itti aanaa Muummicha Ministeeraa Singaappoor Wong Kan Seng’n wal dubbisee..."" which translates to ""He met with the Singaporean Minister for Trade and Industry, Wong Kan Seng..."".  Therefore, George W. Bush spoke with the Minister for Trade and Industry of Singapore.
"
Pirezidaantiin waa’ee babal’insa daldala Eeshiyaa yoom dubbate?,"The correct answer is **C: Filannoo walakkeessatti mo'amuu isaa hordofuun**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Walakkaa filannoo keessatti erga mo’umsa torban tokkoo booda, Bush hordoftootatti waa'ee Eeshiyaa keessatti daldala babal'isuu dubbate.""  This translates to: ""After the three-day summit, Bush addressed the delegates about boosting trade in Asia.""  The phrase ""filannoo walakkeessatti mo'amuu isaa hordofuun"" (after the summit's closing remarks) directly indicates he spoke *during* the summit's closing session.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo Siingaappooriin qaqqabe (During his stay in Singapore):** While he was in Singapore, the passage specifies the speech occurred *during the summit*.
* **B: Wong Kan Seng waliin (With Wong Kan Seng):** He met with Wong Kan Seng, but the passage focuses on his speech *to the delegates*.
* **D: Daawwannaa torban tokkoof Eeshiyaa godhe hundaa keessatti (During his entire three-day visit to Asia):** The passage narrows the speech down to the *summit's closing remarks*.

"Akkaataa Ibsa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kaayyoon walii galaa mootummaa kami?","The correct answer is **A: Hanga Bitootessa bara kanaatti fe’iinsa dabalataaf maallaqa kennuu** (To provide additional funding to the Bitootessa government this year).

Here's why:

* The question asks about the government's *aim* in providing the extra funding.
* The text states the government provided ""teessumni dabalataa 300 ittiin imalan waan argameef walumaa galatti fe’iisi 1,300 ta`uun isaa rakkoo baay`atanii deemuu hir`isa"" which translates to ""an additional 300 (for supplies) resulting in a total budget of 1,300, which is a significant decrease"".
* This indicates the *purpose* of the funding was to provide additional funds for the Bitootessa government *this year*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fe’iinsa walii galaa 300 argachuu** (To obtain 300 preparation funds): This is only part of the total funding and doesn't represent the overall aim.
* **C: Fe’iinsa dabalataa 1,300 argachuu** (To obtain an additional 1,300 funds): This describes the amount of funding, not the government's goal.
* **D: Fe’iinsa hedduu wal dhiphise salphisuu** (To significantly reduce the funds): The text says the budget is *decreasing*, meaning they are *reducing* funds, not *increasing* them with this additional funding.



"
Mootummaan maal awwaje?,"The correct answer is **C: Karoora fe’iisa dabalataa 1,300f maallaqa kennuu**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what the government *awwaje* (gave/provided).
* The text states: ""Teessumni dabalataa 300 ittiin imalan waan argameef walumaa galatti fe’iisi 1,300 ta`uun isaa rakkoo baay`atanii deemuu hir`isa.""  This translates to: ""Because 1,300 additional data were obtained, it is said that the report of 300 additional income is a significant decrease.""
* This means the government *provided* (or used) 1,300 additional data, and that action is related to solving a problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Karoora fe’iisa dabalataa 300f maallaqa kennuu** - This only mentions 300, not 1,300, and it's not the primary action the government took.
* **B: Rakkoo fe’iinsaa furuuf cichanii jiru** - This says they are *trying* to solve the problem, but doesn't describe what action the government took.
* **D: Rakkoon wal dhiphisuu hanga Bitootessaatti ni furama** - This states the problem will be solved by the end of Bitootessa (a month), which isn't what the text says the government *did*.



"
"Akka Ibsa kanaatti, odeeffannoon beekamu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Sadarkaan balaa hir’ateera (The level of the disaster has increased).**

Here's why:

* **The quote states:** ""Isheen, yaadni sammuu rukuttaan battalumaan raawwatamuu akeeku hin jiru jette."" (Isheen, you said you don't know how to properly manage a disaster.)
* **The response:** """"Haa ta’uuyyu malee, sadarkaan doorsisa gara yaadessatti hir’aachu jechuun waan hundu si dhisee deemera jechuu miti.”"" (Yes, but the level of the disaster increasing doesn't mean everything is lost.)

The response acknowledges that the disaster *level* has increased, but it clarifies that this doesn't mean everything is hopeless. Therefore, option A directly reflects the information conveyed in the quote.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Balaan kamiyyuu yeroo ammaa hin jiru (The disaster doesn't happen at any time).** This is not mentioned or implied in the quote.
* **C: Haleellaan akka raawwatamu ni eegama (Praise is expected to be managed).** The quote doesn't discuss praise or how it should be managed.
* **D: Akka qorattoonni mirkaneessanitti haleellichi cimaa ha’a (Praise should be prominent according to the esteemed scholars).**  The quote doesn't reference scholars or the prominence of praise.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""CEP akka yaadaatti hojii gad-lakkisuu yaade."" (CEP intended to reduce its workload). This means they *planned* to reduce workload, but it doesn't confirm they *actually* did so from the start.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The question asks for something *not true* based on the text, and the text says the commission *received* a response from the President, not that they *replied*.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The text states previous failed elections were due to logistical issues, not that the election *time* was the reason.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The text doesn't mention workers regularly holding evening meetings.



Therefore, the only statement that's likely false based on the provided text is that the workers immediately reduced their workload. They *intended* to, but the text doesn't confirm they *did*.

This translates to ""The commission had been monitoring Maartel's work within the Office of the President."" and ""CEP akka yaadaatti hojii gad-lakkisuu... komishinichi deebii Maarteeliin hiriira mormii mootummaa Onkoloolessa keessa eegalee babal’atee tureef godhanidha."" which means ""CEP was expected to implement the work as planned... the commission had been monitoring Maartel's work within the Office of the President.""

Therefore, the President's Commission instructed Maartel to finalize the work.

"Akka Ibsa kanaatti, Naasar atileetota irraan miidhaa waan geessiseef Jimnaastikiin USA maal hin deeggaru?","The correct answer is **D: Qorannoo of danda’e (Self-awareness)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jiimnaastikiin USA qorannoo of danda’ee deggera sunis yaanni sabboonummaan kan Leerii Naasaar lubbun isa hafeen kan kenname hammam badaa akka kan sirriitti mul’isa, kunimmo kan yeroo dheeraaf hin beekamin turee, osoo hin haammatamin turefi jijjiirran sirriin kan hin kennamneefidha.""

This translates to: ""The self-awareness that gymnastics in the USA has gained, thanks to the revelation of Lorie Naesar's ordeal, has brought to light how bad things were hidden, and how it was not known for a long time, and how it was not revealed through a change in secrecy.""

Therefore, the key takeaway is that the revelation of Lorie Naesar's experience has led to a greater **self-awareness** within the gymnastics program.
"
"Akka Ibsa kanaatti, kaayyoo guddaan Jimnaastikii USA fi Koreen Olompiikii Yuunayitid Isteeti gara fuula duraatti maali dha?","The correct answer is **A: Balaa Leerii Naasaar geggeessise irratti ifa baasuu**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jiimnaastikiin USA qorannoo of danda’ee deggera sunis yaanni sabboonummaan kan Leerii Naasaar lubbun isa hafeen kan kenname hammam badaa akka kan sirriitti mul’isa, kunimmo kan yeroo dheeraaf hin beekamin turee, osoo hin haammatamin turefi jijjiirran sirriin kan hin kennamneefidha."" This means the study revealed the abuse by Larry Nassar, and the text emphasizes bringing this to light.

While the other options might be related to gymnastics in general, they are not the *primary* goal highlighted in the provided text.
"
Yeroo balichi uumametti dooniin gara eessaatti adeemaa ture? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text states: ""shipichi karaa irraa ture garaa Puwerto Prinseesa Palawan keessaa osoo deemu."" This translates to ""the ship was from the route to Puerto Princesa Palawan."" Therefore, the ship sailed to Palawan when the disaster occurred.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee doonii eeramee dhugaa kan hin taanee kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Doonii albuuda tarkaanfiiwwan farra ittisuu dha (The ship is a supply ship for disaster relief)**.

Here's why:

* The text states the ship was carrying **""looltoota Ameerikaa kan Filiit torbaffaa fi kan Sasebo, Nagasakii Japaaniiti""** which translates to ""American supplies for the Philippine and Sasebo, Nagasaki Japan."" This indicates a supply ship, not a disaster relief ship. The phrase ""akka doonii keessa ba’aniif hojjechaa jiru"" (working as if they've emerged from a whale) is a metaphorical description of their dedicated work, not a statement about disaster relief.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gara Poorte Pirinsekatti adeemuuf karaa irra ture (The ship traveled by sea to Port Princesa)** - The text explicitly mentions the ship traveled **from** Port Princesa, not to it.
* **B: Palawan keessatti argama (It can be found in Palawan)** - The text states the ship *departed* from Palawan.
* **D: Naavii U.S Doonii torbaffaatu ramadame (A U.S. Navy supply ship was dispatched)** - While the ship is a supply ship and belongs to the U.S. Navy, the text doesn't directly state it was dispatched *specifically* for this event. It implies it was already operational and carrying supplies.



"
Waa’ee loltoota US walqabatee eenyutu ibsicha qaqqabsiise?,"The correct answer is **A: Doonalid Tiraampi**.

The text states: ""Pireezidantiin Ameerikaa Doonaaldi Tiraampi, karaa barreessaa pireesii ibsa kennaniin..."" which translates to ""President of America Donald Trump, through a presidential spokesperson, announced..."". 

Therefore, Donald Trump is the one who made the announcement.
"
"Akka hima kanaatti, biyya kamtu qabsaa’ota booji’aman eeguuf itti gaafatamummaa fudhate?","The correct answer is **B: Awurooppaa**.

The text states: ""Tarkiin eegumsa loltuuwwan ISIS booji’amanii darbitee fudhatti ture, kanneen akka dubbatametti, biyyoonni Awurooppaa dabarsanii biyyoota isaaniitti kennuu didan."" This translates to: ""Turkey had accepted the responsibility for defeating ISIS, which, as reportedly stated, European countries had supplied and refused to return to their own countries.""

Therefore, Europe supplied the ISIS fighters and refused to take them back, implying Europe accepted the responsibility for them.
"
Sababi balaa xiyyaarichaa maali jedhamee amanama?,"The correct answer is **C: Mancaatii lafa ol ka’aa**.

The text states: ""Mancaattin lafa ol ka’aa gaara fakkaatu keessatti ta’ee..."" which translates to ""Because of the large amount of dry earth..."" This directly links the disaster to a large amount of dry earth, which is a type of soil erosion/land degradation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mancaatii lafaa (Soil erosion)** While related, the text specifies *dry* earth, indicating a particular type of soil degradation.
* **B: Dhukaasa jibbiinsaa (Heavy rain)** The text mentions ""haala qilleensa badaa"" (bad drought conditions), suggesting a *lack* of rain, not excessive rain.
* **D: Haala qilleensaa hamaa (Severe drought conditions)**  While drought is mentioned, the text specifically highlights the *dry earth* as the cause.  The text doesn't explicitly attribute the disaster to the drought itself, but rather the resulting dry earth.



Therefore, **C: Mancaatii lafa ol ka’aa (Large amount of dry earth)** is the most accurate answer.
"
Mancaatiin haala akkamiin balaan kun akka qaqqabuu taasise?,"The correct answer is **B: Mancaatii (The lack of care/Neglect)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mancaattin lafa ol ka’aa gaara fakkaatu keessatti ta’ee, fi ani bu’aa abidda soodachisaa jedheen amane."" This translates to ""Neglect, even though it looked like a serious wound, and I thought I had done a good deed by applying ointment.""

The passage directly links the *lack of care (mancaatii)* - specifically the application of an inadequate remedy - to the worsening of the situation. It implies that the initial treatment (the ointment) was insufficient and therefore contributed to the problem. The ""lafa ol ka'aa gaara"" (serious wound) worsened *because* of the initial treatment, stemming from a lack of proper care.

The other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kan diinaa (Religion):** The passage doesn't mention religion.
*   **C: Gamtaan (The War):** While the context involves war, the passage focuses on the *treatment* (or lack thereof) of the wound, not the war itself.
*   **D: Lafa ol ka’aa (The serious wound):** The wound was already serious *before* the lack of care exacerbated the problem. The lack of care *caused* the wound to worsen.



"
Sababa lolaan aanga’ootni maal abdachaa jiru?,"The correct answer is **A: Cirracha deebisanii ijaaruu (Returning the craters)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the large craters formed by the nuclear explosions in 1963 haven't healed. It then mentions that if the land doesn't recover from the immediate impact, the scorched land could become habitable again. Therefore, the answer refers to the craters needing to heal, or return to their original state.
"
Ijaarsi hidhichaa kanneen armaan gadii keessaa isa kam irratti dhiibbaa dhaabbataa geessiseera?,"The correct answer is **A: Cirraacha galaanaa (Sedimentary rocks)**.

The text states: ""Biyyeen kun tuullaa cerrechaa fi handaara galaanaa kan bineensota bosonaaf akka bidolleettii tajaajilu uumuuf barbaachisaadha."" This translates to: ""This land is necessary for the formation of valuable deposits for the bones of animals from sedimentary rocks and sand.""

Therefore, the land's potential for forming sedimentary rocks is what brought peace to the region.
"
"Akka hima kanaatti, eenyutu waa'ee haleellaa raawwatamuu danda'u Yuunaayitid Isteet intelif kenne?","The correct answer is **C: Madda hin ibsamne (Unknown source)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the information comes from a ""leellistoonni somaaliyaa irraa"" (Somali sources) and that the US ""madaa hin beekamne irraa"" (from an unknown source) received the information.  Therefore, the source of the information is unknown.  None of the other options (Financial intelligence of Somalia, Ethiopian intelligence, or Kenyan intelligence) are mentioned as the origin of the report.
"
Ibsoota armaan gadii keessaa sirriitti karoora haleellaa fiinxaalessitootaa kan ibsu kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Biyya lama keessaatti bakka sirriitti mul’atutti boombii dhoosuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Somalia-based al-Shabaab militants are conducting bomb attacks *in* Kenya and Ethiopia.  It also mentions the goal was to create ""safe havens"" (bakka beekamoo) in both countries.  Therefore, they are planting bombs in secret locations *within* both Kenya and Ethiopia.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Biyya tokko keessaa bakka sirriitti mul’atutti boombii dhoosuu** (Planting bombs secretly in one country only): The passage explicitly states attacks are happening in *both* Kenya and Ethiopia.
* **B: Biyyoota lamaanitti boombii dhoosuu** (Planting bombs in two countries): While true, it doesn't specify the secret locations. The key is they're planted *secretly*.
* **D: Biyya tokkotti boombii dhoosuu** (Planting bombs in one country only): Again, the passage indicates attacks are happening in *both* Kenya and Ethiopia.



"
Namoota armaan gadii keessaa abukaatoo kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Maakis Triyaantafyilopoliis**.

The text states that Makis Triantafylopoulos, the journalist who revealed the information on his TV show, is *not* a lawyer. The other options (Peexiroos Mantoovaloos, Sakis Kechaagiyoogluu, and Joorji Nikolaakopaawuloos) are all mentioned as lawyers.
"
Hawwaasa seeraa Giriik keessatti namoota garee kamtu akka miidhamtootaatti hineeramne?,"The correct answer is **B: Abbootii Seeraa (Lawyers)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the lawyers (abukaatoo) in Greece have been ""fighting for justice"" and ""working hard to resolve difficult cases"" in recent years. It mentions their efforts to represent the Greek people and highlight injustices. The news report about Peexiroos Mantoovaloos and Evangelos Kaluwosis further supports this, as they are lawyers who have been involved in legal matters and have publicly addressed issues.

While the other options might be affected by the justice system, the text focuses specifically on the role and efforts of lawyers in seeking justice for the Greek people.
"
Hindiin kiriikeetii meeqa dhabde?,"The correct answer is **D: 36**.

The text states: ""erga kaappiteenii wiikeetii dhabdeen booda Indiyaan marsicha xumuruuf dhabiinsa 7aan fiigicha 36 gooteeti."" This translates to: ""After losing the wicket of captain Dhoni, India scored 36 runs in the last overs.""
"
"Akka hima kanaatti, qabxiin olaanaan tapha kiriikeetii meeqa?","The correct answer is **A: Fiigicha 70**.

The passage states: ""kubbaawwan 41 qofaa keessatti fiigichawwan 70 afuroota..."" which translates to ""in 41 innings, he scored 70 runs..."".  This directly answers the question of how many runs he scored in his best cricketing performance.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa mufannaa Adam Cuerdenf sababa kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Warra Walesin dhaggeefatamuu dhabuu**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Adam Cuerden said Weels (presumably a person or entity) helped them from the beginning. 
* Initially, the problems were attributed to ""law"".
* Later, they realized the issue was because they weren't being heard, and they used all their capabilities to resolve the problem.

Therefore, not being heard (dhaggeefatamuu dhabuu) is presented as a *cause* of the problem, not something Adam Cuerden didn't experience. The other options are not mentioned in the text as reasons for the issue.

The passage mentions:

* **A: Imaammata marsariitii haaraa waa’ee qabiyyee saal quunnamtii ilaalchisee** - While not directly a *cause* *for* Adam Cuerden, it describes the media that reported on the event.
* **B: Aartii Wales haquu** - Not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Soba waa’ee sababa haqamuu aartii** - This refers to the help they received in figuring out the cause.



"
"Akka hima kanaatti, marsariitii sana irraa kan balleeffame maali dha?","The correct answer is **B: Qabiyyee saal quunnamtii (Content)**.

The passage states: ""Marsariitii sana irraa sababa ta'eera qabiyyee saal quunnamtii qabanii kan miidiyaalee eyyemaan banaman miiliyoonotaan lakkaawwaman ammaaf...""  This translates to: ""...the reason was the content it held, which was published by millions of online media...""

Therefore, the content is what was removed.
"
"Akka hima kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Amiir Kahaan kan hin deeggarre kami?","The correct answer is **A: Dubartoota dorgommii lolaa Olompiikii hirmaatan itti dabaluu (Promoting female Olympic boxing)**.

Here's why:

The text states Amir Khan said, ""I have no fear of women. That's my belief."" He further added that he wanted to support British boxers for the 2012 London Olympics. While he expressed a lack of fear of women, the text doesn't say he actively *promoted* women's Olympic boxing. He specifically mentioned supporting British boxers in general. The other options are not directly mentioned as things he *didn't* do:

*   **B: Dorgomtoota Biritish (British boxers)** - He said he wanted to support them.
*   **C: Yaada warra dubartootaa (Women's rights)** - His statement *could* be interpreted as a stance supporting women's rights, though it's focused on a specific context (boxing).
*   **D: Landan Olompiikii qopheessuu (Organizing the London Olympics)** - The text mentions his desire to support boxers *for* the London Olympics, not to organize the event itself.

Therefore, promoting female Olympic boxing is the action Amir Khan did not undertake based on the information given.



"
"Akka hima kanaatti, Amir Khan yaada dhuunfaa qabaatus kanneen armaan gadii keessaa isa kam deeggara?","The correct answer is **A: Dubartoota dorgommii lolaa (Female fighters)**.

The passage states that Amir Khan said, ""I have no respect for women who fight."" This directly indicates his opinion about female fighters. The other options are either too specific (like mentioning the 2004 Olympics) or irrelevant to the core of his statement."
Piiter Leenzi yoom du’e?,"The correct answer is **C: Hospitaalatti**.

The text states: ""Hojjettoota fayyaa toora irra jiraniin atattamaan ilaalamee gara hospitaala naannoo sanaa, bakka inni itti du’eetti geeffame."" which translates to ""Health workers who were on the scene initially examined him and took him to the regional hospital, where he was taken.""
"
Zhaaviyeer Zaayaatiin eenyudha?,"The correct answer is **A: Hojjettoota yaalaa daandii irraa (Traffic officer)**.

The text states: ""itti ansees morkataa isaa Zhaaviyeer Zaayaatiin rukutame,"" which translates to ""he was taken by his colleague, Zhaaviyeer Zaayaatiin.""  The subsequent sentence says ""Zayaat balaa sana keessatti hin miidhamne"" (""Zayaat was not injured in the accident"").  This implies that Zhaaviyeer Zaayaatiin is a colleague who responded to the accident, and in the context of an accident involving a motorcycle, a traffic officer is the most likely profession.
"
Namni balaliisaa yaaddoo keessa jiru tokko hojii keessoo xiyyaara tokkoo hubachuun isaa haala kam keessatti isa fayyaduu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **B: Jibbiinsi balaliisa isaanii sodaa waan hin beekamne irraa yoo kan madde ta'e**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to understand the root cause of aggression, especially when it stems from a lack of knowledge or misunderstanding, can be helpful. Option B directly addresses this: ""Jibbiinsi balaliisa isaanii sodaa waan hin beekamne irraa yoo kan madde ta'e"" translates to ""If their aggression stems from a lack of knowledge about the root cause."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's core argument.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yoo imaltoonni sodaa isaaniitti qaana’an:**  ""If the individuals are threatened by the root cause."" While threat *can* contribute to aggression, the passage emphasizes a lack of *understanding* as a key factor, not just being threatened.
* **C: Yoo imaltuun gosa geejjibaa hundaaf jibba qabaate:** ""If the individual harbors hatred for all types of aggression.""  This is too broad. The passage is about understanding specific instances of aggression, not general hatred.
* **D: Yaaddoon isaanii taateewwan dhiphisaa balaliisaa wajjin wal hin qabanne irraa kan madde yoo ta’e:** ""If their thoughts are unrelated to the provoking circumstances of the aggression."" This is also too broad. The passage argues that connecting thoughts to the root cause is important, not disconnecting them.



"
"Kutaa kana irratti hundaa’uun, imaltuun gatii irratti xiyyeeffate kanneen armaan gadii keessaa isa kam dhuma irratti raawwata?","The correct answer is **D: Marsariitii daandii xiyyaaraa sakatta’a (The price of the tomato is assessed by the market).**

Here's why:

The passage states that the price of tomatoes is often underestimated in the initial market and that it can fluctuate based on supply and demand. It emphasizes the importance of observing the market *before* selling.  Therefore, the price is determined by market forces (supply and demand), which is reflected in the actions of the market itself.  Option D directly addresses this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhiyeessii dhaabbilee imalaa hedduu qorataa (Recording the output of many market stalls):** While recording output is *part* of understanding the market, it doesn't directly determine the price.
* **B: Kallattiin daandiin xiyyaaraa irraa ajeja qabsiifadhaa (Getting a sample of tomatoes from the market stall):**  Getting a sample is for quality assessment, not price determination.
* **C: Gatii dhaabbilee imalaa hedduu wal madaalchisa (Many market stalls communicate with each other):** Communication is helpful, but the price is still driven by the overall market dynamics.



"
"Akka hima kanaatti, imaltoonni gatii balalii isa gaarii ta’e argachuuf dursanii maal gochuu qabu?","The correct answer is **C: Kallattiin karaa daandii xiyyaaraa irraa ajeja qabsiifadhaa (Analyze the route of the wholesale market).**

Here's why:

The text states that the price of goods in wholesale markets can vary significantly depending on the location.  To find good prices, one needs to understand the supply chain – the route the goods take from origin to market.  Analyzing this route will reveal where the cheapest prices are likely to be found.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Marsariitii daandii xiyyaaraa sakatta’a (Inspect the wholesale market):** While inspection is helpful, it doesn't address the *location* aspect that the text emphasizes. You might find good prices at one part of the market and high prices elsewhere.
* **B: Gatii walitti qabattoota adda addaa wal madaalchisaa (Compare prices with different suppliers):**  Price comparison is valuable, but it's most effective *after* understanding the base price/cost, which is influenced by the route.
* **D: Kallattiin ejenttoota imalaa irraa ajeja qabsiifadhaa (Analyze the agents of the goods):**  While agents play a role, focusing solely on them doesn't give a complete picture of the supply chain and price variations.



"
Dhaabbata dhiyeessiif yoom hiriyyaan imalaa barbaachisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Yeroo waantonni mi’a sakatta’ameetti ergaman (When items are sent with customs clearance)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yoo wantoota fireeyiti qilleensaan ergan, karaaleen muraasni bakka ofirritti buusan fi buufataalee bira gahuuf tarii guyyootii fudhachuu danda’a."" This translates to ""If items are sent through customs clearance, the roads are blocked and delays occur for days.""

This indicates that the biggest delay and therefore the most needed ""hiriyyaan imalaa"" (assistance/support) happens when customs clearance is required.  Options A, B, and D are not directly linked to the delay described in the text.
"
"Kutaa kana irratti hundaa’uun, yeroo daandii xiyyaaraa balalii yeroo baay’ee gamtaan fayyadamtanii keessaa filattani, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa isa kamiif dursa kennuu qabdu?","The best answer is **A: Daandii xiyyaaraa tuqaa hedduu kennuu (Providing many small choice options)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that providing a *variety* of choices, even small ones, leads to greater satisfaction.  It mentions that offering different types of choice options (buufata xiyaaraa adda addaa waliin balali’uun) results in a better outcome than relying on just one. 

* **A (Providing many small choice options)** directly aligns with the idea of variety and caters to different preferences.  It's about giving the user options to build upon, rather than a single, large choice.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B (Large overall choice options):**  The passage suggests avoiding this.  It's not about a single, massive choice, but a variety.
* **C (Choice options used frequently for interaction):** While interaction is good, the *type* of interaction (variety) is the core point.
* **D (Adding extra optional choices):** This could be *part* of variety, but the passage focuses on the *number* and *types* of choices presented initially.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
"Akka ibsa kanaatti, tuqaa balaliinsaa yeroo baay’ee fayyadamtanii hedduu kan kennu eenyu?","The correct answer is **A: Daandii xiyyaaraa gara garaa gamtaa adda addaa keessa jiran**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""akka ati yaaduutti dandeetti buufata xiiyaraa yeroo baayee fayyadamtuutti makaamuf fedhuu yoo maltellee, carraawwan argaamu danda’aan garaagara waan ta’aniif buufata xiyaara adda addaa waliin balali’uun arjooma caalaa argachuudandeessa.""
* **Translation:** ""If you use the breathing technique frequently and diligently, and if you are able to focus your mind, you can see diverse animals, and combining different breathing techniques will bring you even greater benefits than usual.""
* **The key is ""buufata xiyaara adda addaa waliin balali’uun"" (combining different breathing techniques).** The text explicitly links the greatest benefits to using *different* breathing techniques. Option A is the only one that reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Daandii xiyyaaraa yeroo hedduu ittiin imaltan kan gamtaa wal fakkaataa jalatti argamu (Breathing techniques frequently practiced that are found in the same group):** This doesn't emphasize the *diversity* of techniques, which the text highlights as key to greater benefits.
* **C: Daandii xiyyaaraa yeroo hedduu ittiin imaltan kan gamtaa kan biraa jalatti argamu (Breathing techniques frequently practiced that are found in another group):** This isn't specific enough.  The text isn't saying techniques are in separate groups; it's about *different* techniques overall.
* **D: Daandii xiyyaaraa gara garaa gamtaa wal fakkaataa keessa jiran (Diverse breathing techniques that are found in the same group):** This contradicts the core message that benefits come from combining *different* techniques.

"Akka ibsa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa aalikoolii hedduu fayyadamuun miirri miidhamu isa kami?","The correct answer is **B: Agartuu (Liver)**.

"Ibsa kana keessatti akka eerameetti, miidhaa aalkooliin fidu hir’isuu kan danda’u maali?","The correct answer is **B: Dhugaatii alkoolii seeraan alaa oomishame dhuguu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sodaan inni guddaan kan dabalu yeroo dhugaatii seeran ala oomishaman fayyadamnu dha."" This translates to ""The most dangerous substance is to use alcohol that is produced outside of the legal channels.""

Option B directly reflects this statement.  The other options are not supported by the text:

* **A: Alkoolii meetaanoolii waliin dhuguu** - The text mentions methanol as a byproduct of alcohol fermentation, but doesn't suggest mixing it *with* alcohol to reduce harm.
* **C: Alkoolii madaalawaa ta’e dhuguu** -  The text doesn't mention the strength of the alcohol as a factor in reducing harm.
* **D: Namoota gara garaa waliin dhuguu** -  The text doesn't mention social aspects or mixing with different people as related to reducing harm.

Gatiin qabeenyaa ol’aanaa Amsterdam’s keessaa eessa jira?,"The correct answer is **B: Bakka hambaa addunyaa UNESCO ta’ee murtaa’e kamiyyuu keessatti** (A place that has been designated a World Heritage site by UNESCO).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""akka Iddoo Hambaa Seenaa Addunyaa UNESCO tii bocame"" which translates to ""it has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.""
* Option B directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Muummee Dachii** - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Naannoo Biinenistaad keessaa buqqifame** - While Dachii is in the province of BeNeLux, the text doesn't say it's *just* a province. Its UNESCO status is the key point.
* **D: Bakkoota seena qabeessa ta’an** -  While Dachii is historically significant, the text highlights its UNESCO World Heritage designation as its most significant attribute, not just being historically old.



"
Maaliif Aanaan Naannoo Dachii akka bakkeewwan hambaa addunyaa UNESCO tti galmaa'e?,"The correct answer is **A: Akka seenaa fi aadaatti iddoo guddaa waan qabuuf (Because of its great historical and cultural significance)**.

This translates to: ""The entire complex was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List because of its outstanding cultural and historical values and its significance as a national treasure.""

While the other options might be related, they are not the primary reason mentioned in the text. The core reason is the historical and cultural significance.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu daawwannaa Phinoom Kiroomin gatii akka qabaatu taasisa?","The correct answer is **A: Toonlii Saap irraan ilaaluu (Looking at the Toonlii Saap)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Haalli dukkanaa’aan mana qulqullummaa sanaatii fi mul’uun haroo Toonlii Saap irraan qaari’aanii argan yaabbii tulluchaa barbaachisaa godhu."" This translates to: ""The state of the temple and the image of Toonlii Saap, which were damaged by the floods, made it necessary to build a new one.""

Therefore, the condition of the Toonlii Saap (the image) is directly linked to the need for the temple's restoration and its value to visitors. The passage implies that seeing the damaged Toonlii Saap makes the situation worthy of attention and potentially a visit. The other options are not directly mentioned as contributing to the temple's value according to the passage.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, daawwattoonni Phinoom Kiroomin seenuuf maaltu isaan barbaachisa?","The correct answer is **A: Mana sagadaa Yaasoovarman irra utaalanii ce’uu** (To pray at the Yaasoovarman temple).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Manni Qulqullummaa fiixee gaaraa kun dhuma jaarraa 9ffaa kessa ijaarame. Yeroo bulchiinsa Mootii Yaasoovarmaan."" (This glorious temple was established in the late 9th century, during the reign of the Yaasoovarman dynasty.)  The entire passage is describing the temple in Phinoom Kiroomin and its historical significance.  The key takeaway is that people visit to *pray* there.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Naannoo Sii’eemi Ripii imaluu** (The Sii’eemi Ripii region) -  The text mentions the location, but it's not the primary reason for visiting.
* **C: Darbiinsi Aangikoor argachuu** (To see the Aangikoor pathway) - The text says Aangikoor isn't necessary to reach the temple.
* **D: Naannoo Toonii dooniin adeemuu** (To serve in the Toonii region) - There's no mention of serving in the Toonii region.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa tuuristoonni Antaartikaa akka hin daawwaane dhorkuu kan danda’u kami?","The correct answer is **B: Fedhii dhuunfaatti galaana Roos qorachuuf qabaachuu** (Having sufficient financial means to travel to the Ross Sea).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that tourists travel to the Ross Sea (""isa buufata addaa qabu bira ga’uuf gara keessaatti adeemu"" - to reach the interior with the main ice shelf). It also mentions that tourism is expensive (""daawwannaan tuuristii baayee gatiin mi’aa dha"" - there are many expensive tourists).  Therefore, having enough money to afford the trip to the Ross Sea is a necessary condition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baasiin imalaa qaalii ta’uu** (This type of bus being expensive): The text doesn't mention buses at all.
*   **C: Sagantaa hojii Muddee fi Amajjii keessa imala gochuu nama dandeessisu** (Being able to perform long and harsh work inside): While the environment is harsh, the text doesn't state that tourists need to be able to perform manual labor.
*   **D: Qaamaan bakkaa bakkatti socho’uu muraasa** (It's enough to travel to different places): The text says travel to different places is part of the experience, but it doesn't indicate that simply being able to travel is sufficient to be a tourist in Antarctica."
Tuuristiin gaara irratti ol ba’uu fedhu kutaa Antaartikaa kamiin daawachuu mala?,"The correct answer is **A: Galaana Roozii (Ross Ice Shelf)**.

The text states: ""Daawwannaan tuuristii baayee gatiin mi’aa dha, qaamni ga’aa ta’uus gaafata, kan geggeeffamus ganna keessa Sadaasaa-Guraandhala, **akkasuma bakka qarqara galaanaa, oddolawwan fi Galaana Roozii jedhamutti kan daanga’eedhas.**"" 

This indicates that the Ross Ice Shelf (Galaana Roozii) is a significant tourist destination in Antarctica.
"
Qorannoon dursa ammayyaa xiqqeenyaan eessatti argama?,"The correct answer is **C: Bakka fagoo (Tourist spots)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""yeroo baay’ee magaalotaa fi mooraa keessatti argamu, innis isa akka yeroo ammayyaa kana osoo hin taane salphaafi mijaataadha."" which translates to ""found in many cities and beaches, and it is also a souvenir and a gift.""

This indicates that you're likely to find these ""buufataaleen qorannoo hawaa"" (air pollution study artifacts) in tourist spots, as people often purchase souvenirs from such locations. The other options are less directly supported by the text."
Teleskooppii qorannoon ammayyaa mana eessa keessa taa’uu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **B: Mooraa yuuniversitii (University observatory)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that telescopes are often found in **""bakkeewwan fagoorra""** which translates to ""observatories"" or ""places for observation.""
* Universities are common places to find observatories because they are institutions of higher learning and research.
* While telescopes *could* be in museums or educational centers, the text emphasizes their use for research and observation, which aligns better with a university observatory.

The other options are less likely:

* **A: Godaambaa keessa (Inside a building)** - Too general. While telescopes *are* inside buildings, it doesn't specify where.
* **C: Naannoo bakka barnootaa (Educational center)** - Possible, but less common than universities.
* **D: Mooraa guddaa keessa (Inside a large city)** - Too broad.  It doesn't specify the *type* of location where telescopes are found.



"
"Akka hima kanaatti, guyyaa qarqara galaanaa tasgabbaa'aa ta'eef naannoo kamtu gaarii ta'a?","The correct answer is **B: Miishin Beey**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cinaan bishaanii Taamaakii Diraayiv Waatimaataa Heerbar irra jiru, baazaarii magaala qarqaraa **Miishin Beey fi St Hiiler Seentaraal Ookland argama**.""

This directly indicates that Miishin Beey is a market where you can find the ""qarqara bishaanii"" (presumably the type of skull being discussed). Therefore, it's a place where you would find the skull on the day the ""qarqara galaanaa"" (skull festival) is celebrated.
"
"Akka hima kanaatti, bishaan daakuuf bakki nageenyi isaa eegame eessa?","The correct answer is **D: Loongi Beey**.

The text states: ""Qarqarri Galaanaa Inni Kaabaa(inni Naannoo Kaaba Harbar) garba Paasifiikiifi loongi Beeyitiin gara Kaaba Diivoonpoortii kibba keessatti."" which translates to ""The Galaana's crack (the Kaaba Harbor region) is located on the Pacific coast and near the Bay of Jelly, south of Kaaba Diivoonport.""  The passage also mentions the crack is near the Bay of Jelly (Loongi Beey).  The text explicitly links the crack's location to the Bay of Jelly. Therefore, the Bay of Jelly is the place where the crack is located.
"
"Bakka kutaa sana keessatti ibsame yeroo daawwattan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu akka sirrii hin taaneetti ilaalama?","The correct answer is **C: Qoosaa qoosuu (Destroying the victims)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the speaker observed people who ""love, cherish, and admire"" those who were targeted in the Holokaust (Jews and non-Jews who suffered). It also condemns the actions of the Nazis, specifically mentioning that they ""did not destroy them with fire or by burning them away, or by any other means."" This directly implies that the act of **destroying the victims (qoosuu)** is the most egregious and unacceptable action observed and condemned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Qofaatti dalaguu (Just observing):** While observing is mentioned, the passage focuses on the *reactions* of people and the condemnation of the Nazis' actions, not just passive observation.
* **B: Naannoo bakkichaatti mallattoo ta’e kaa’anii dhiisuu (Leaving a sign at the place):** The passage doesn't mention anything about leaving signs.
* **D: Bocoota jiran uruu (Removing the existing trash):**  While removing trash might be a positive action, it doesn't address the core issue of the victims' destruction and the hatred that fueled it.



"
Kunneen keessaa kamtu afaan linguwaa firaankaa ibsa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kan ijaarame** (Engineered).

The text states that French is a constructed language (""linguwaa firaankaa, kanneen afaanota uumamaa ykn jalqabaa sababa tokkoof ykn kan biraaf akka mala waliin-dubbii dubbattoota afaanota biroo gidduutti caalaa iddoo fudhataa dhufaniidha"").  ""Uumamaa"" means created/artificial, and ""ijaaramayyu"" means constructed/engineered. Therefore, ""Kan ijaarame"" is the most accurate translation to describe French's origin.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Namtolchee** (Natural): This refers to naturally evolved languages, which French is not.
* **B: Kan uumamaa hin taane** (Not created): This is the opposite of what the text implies.
* **D: Orgaanikii** (Organic): This is used for languages that evolve naturally over time, unlike constructed languages.



"
Ibsa kamtu afaanota gargaartuu sirriitti hin ibsu?,"The correct answer is **C: Afaanota haala rakkisaa quunnamtii fooyyessuuf ijaaramani dha**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Afaanotni Ogzilaarii kan namaan hojjetamee yookiin ijaarame dha afaan wal qunnamtii ariifachiisuf kalaqamaan namoota giddutii yoo ta’uudha baate kan haasaan wal qunnamuuf rakkatan."" This translates to ""The Ogzilaari languages are languages that were created or modified to facilitate communication between people who otherwise struggled to understand each other.""

* **The options analyze the function of the Ogzilaari languages:**
    * **A:** This is incorrect because the text explicitly states they *were* created to facilitate communication.
    * **B:** While related, this is not the primary reason for their creation. The text focuses on overcoming communication barriers.
    * **C:** This accurately captures the purpose.  They were developed *to overcome the difficulty of communication* and *enhance interaction*.
    * **D:** While the text mentions their importance in facilitating communication between different languages, it's not the core *reason* they were created. The problem was the *difficulty* of communication, not their inherent superiority.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of the Ogzilaari languages' function as described in the text.



"
"Akka ibsa kanaatti, imaltoonni yoo imalli bashannanaa isaanii gaafa bonaa ta’e maal adda baafachuu qabu?","The correct answer is **B: Ulaagaa viisaa (Visa procedures)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the ""Imaltoonni doonii ulaagaawwan visaa irraa bilisa (ulaagaalee mirkaneessaa)."" This translates to: ""Immigration officials inform passengers about visa procedures (facilitating peaceful processes).""

Therefore, if immigration officials are doing their job well (making the process smooth), the thing that will be highlighted is the visa procedures.
"
"Akka ibsa kanaatti, yoo imalli bashannanaa imaltootaa gaafa gannaa ta’e maal gochuu hin qabani?","The correct answer is **C: Ulaagaa viisaa (Visa duty)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where people are suffering and need to express their grievances through peaceful means (like demonstrations). The ""Imaltoonni"" (officials/authorities) are informed about visa duties (presumably related to visa processes).

The question asks what joyful officials should do if they are overwhelmed.  The connection is that the visa duty is likely a source of stress or workload for the officials.  Therefore, the joyful officials should address the **visa duty** issue to alleviate the stress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sa’atii magaalaa keessaa (Local time):**  This is irrelevant to the situation.
*   **B: Cabbii keessa deemuu (Entering a tent/demonstration):** This is the action of the suffering people, not what the officials should do.
*   **D: Qulqulluu Piterisbergiin (Holy Petersburg):** This is a location and not a solution.

Baarseloonaa keessatti mallattoo fi beeksisaaf afaan Kaataaloon maaliif yeroo baayyee itti fayyadamu?,"The correct answer is **B: Afaan hojii magaalattii isa jalqabaa ture (The city's original working language)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ammayyuu, Afaan Ispeen geejjiba uumataa fi wantoota adda biroo keessatti bal’inaan ni fayyadamama. Mallattoowwan hedduun kan ibsaman afaan Kaatalaan qofaa, sababni isaas afaan hojii isa jalqabaa ta’uun isaa seeraan hundeeffameera.""  (However, the Spanish language is mainly used in public services and other things. Many signs are only in Catalan, the reason being that it was the city's original working language.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bal’inaan afaan Ispaanish caalaa waan hubatamuuf (Because it is more known than the Spanish language)** - The text implies the opposite; Catalan was used *because* it was the original language, even though Spanish is more widely known now.
* **C: Baarseeloonaa keessatti afaan filatamaa dha (Catalan is the chosen language in Barcelona)** -  The text doesn't state that it's been officially chosen.  It says it was the *original* language.
* **D: Meetroo fi bakkeewwan uummataa biroo irra caalaa lammiilee afaan Kaataaloon dubbatanii dha (People speak Catalan more than Spanish on the metro and in other public places)** - While the text mentions Catalan being used on signs, it doesn't explicitly say it's used *more* than Spanish in public places. It only says Spanish is used mainly in public services.



"
Afaan armaan gadii keessaa isa kamtu beeksisa idilee sirna geejjiba baaburaa Baarseloonaa keessaatti hojiirra oola?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaataalaanii**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Mallattoowwan hedduun kan ibsaman afaan Kaatalaan qofaani, sababni isaas afaan hojii isa jalqabaa ta’uun isaa seeraan hundeeffameera.""  This translates to: ""Many signs are in Catalan only, the reason being that it is the initial working language and is based on its own laws.""

This indicates that Catalan is the primary language used in the internal workings and signage of the Barcelona subway. While other languages are used for public announcements, Catalan is the dominant one.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, meeshaa isa kamtu Mana ciisichaa gati jabeessaan carraan filatamuu isaa gadi bu’aa dha?","The correct answer is **B: Haala adda ta’een meeshaalee durii mijeessuu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Cireen nyaata naannichi waqtiidhaanii naannichaa yookaan nyaata addaa simataa saayinii of keessatii hammata. Haalli teessumaa sun bakka seenaa ijaarsa dulloomaa kanneen meeshaalee teessumaa kan durii of keessaa qaban, bakka itti qeensa bareechatan,fi bakka bishaan daakan ta’uu mala.""

This translates to: ""The appearance of the local food is enhanced by the placement of antique utensils, on a historical display of antique utensils, on a showcase of precious items, and on a display of beautiful objects.""

The text emphasizes that the **placement of antique utensils** (meeshaalee durii) within the dining area enhances the overall appearance of the space. Options A, C, and D are not supported by the text.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen arman gadii keessaa isa kamtu qabxii bu’uuraa wal dorgommii Manneen ciisichaa gati jabeessaa gidduuttii taasifamuu miti?","The correct answer is **D: Nyaataa fi dhugaatii naannootii dhihaatan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cireen nyaata naannichi waqtiidhaanii naannichaa yookaan nyaata addaa simataa saayinii of keessatti hammata. **Haalli teessumaa sun bakka seenaa ijaarsa dulloomaa kanneen meeshaalee teessumaa kan durii of keessaa qaban, bakka itti qeensa bareechatan,fi bakka bishaan daakan ta’uu mala.**""

This translates to: ""The condition of the tessuma (likely referring to a specific type of clay or soil) is in the place of the history of traditional learning, containing ancient tools, the place of the bare earth, and the place where the water is drained.""

This describes how the *ingredients* (nyataa - food/ingredients and dhugaatii - soil/clay) from the region contribute to the unique and valuable quality of the clay used in pottery. The passage emphasizes that the specific combination of local materials is what gives the clay its particular characteristics and value.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Walfaana miidheksuu (Mixing well):** While mixing is important in pottery, the passage doesn't highlight it as the primary factor giving the clay value.
*   **B: Heddumminaan waqtiidhaan ciree dhiyeessuu (Firing clay for a long time):** Firing is also essential, but the passage focuses on the clay's *composition* and the local materials it's made from.
*   **C: Siree baay’ee adda ta’e (Very fine clay):** The passage doesn't specify the fineness of the clay as a key element, but rather the *origin* of the clay and its combination with other ingredients.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu Bara 2022tti Beejingi keessatti hin qophaa’u?","The correct answer is **B: Sagantaa naannoo Taizicheng ski**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the ski events were held in Zhangjiakou, which is 220 km (140 miles) *from Beijing*.
* The question asks which of the options *didn't* take place in Beijing.
* Therefore, the ski events, being held in Zhangjiakou, didn't happen *in* Beijing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sirna baniinsaa (Ceremony):** The text says Beijing hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies.
* **C: Sirna cufiinsaa (Opening Ceremony):**  The text explicitly states Beijing hosted the opening ceremony.
* **D: Qophee cabbii mana keessaa (Home-made tea):** This refers to the tea served, which was part of the events in Beijing.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu Bara 2022tti Beejingiin keessatti qophaa’a?","The correct answer is **C: Olompikii Gannaa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""magaalaa yeroo jalqabaaf Olompikii Gannaa fi Olompikii Bonaa lamaanuu keessummeessite ishee godha"" which translates to ""it became the first city to host both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics."" Therefore, the Summer Olympics (Olompikii Gannaa) were held in Beijing in 2022.

While the other options are mentioned in the passage (Winter Olympics, fireworks, and the opening ceremony), they are not the main event that took place in Beijing in 2022.
"
Eenyutu carraa olaanaa infuluweenza Aviyaaniidhaan qabamuu qaba?,"The correct answer is **A: Daawwattoota Simbiraa (Birdwatchers)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Beerd filuu, yookiin infuluweenza Aviyaan jedhamuun kan beekamu, sinbirrootaa fi hoosiftoota qabuu danda’a..."" which translates to ""Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, can affect various birds and even humans...""  Then it continues ""...Baay'een isaanii namoota horsiisa lukkuu irratti hirmaachisaniiru garuu kan simbirroo eeganiif balaa tokko tokko qaba."" which means ""...Many of them have been involved in cattle ranching, but it is a disaster for birds.""

Therefore, birdwatchers are directly exposed to birds, making them at higher risk. The other options are less directly related to the spread of avian influenza.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa hima isa kamtu sirriitti Beerd filuu ibsa?","The correct answer is **B: Dhukkubicha baay’inaan simbirroota caalaa nama irratti gabaafame.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Rakkoowwan kumaa gadi ta’an namoota irratti gabaasamanii jiru, garuu muraasni isaanii kan nama galaafatanidha."" (Thousands of cases have been reported in humans, but only a few are known.) This emphasizes that the illness affects humans significantly.
* **The text also mentions:** ""Baay'een isaanii namoota horsiisa lukkuu irratti hirmaachisaniiru garuu kan simbirroo eeganiif balaa tokko tokko qaba."" (Many of them have been observed in sheep, but they pose a danger to livestock if they get sick.) This highlights the impact on humans compared to livestock.

Options A, C, and D are not supported by the text. The text doesn't claim that only shepherds are affected, that viewers should be aware, or that all cases inevitably lead to death.  Option B accurately reflects the text's emphasis on the significant impact of the illness on human populations.



"
Ulaan Waayit Sii-Baaltiikii maal walitti qabsiisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Garba Arkitikii fi Galaana Baaltikii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sululli Hara-Baaltik Galaana Arkitik Hara Baaltik, Haroo Laadoogaa fi Seenti Peeterisbergi wajjiin caalaatti lagaa fi haroo walitti hidha."" (The Gulf of Bothnia, the Arctic Ocean, Lake Ladoga, and St. Petersburg are connected by rivers and lakes).

This directly connects the Arctic Ocean (via the Gulf of Bothnia) and the Baltic Sea. The other options are not mentioned as directly connected to the Ulaanbaatar-Russia route.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, imaltoota addaan kutuu dhiisuudhaaf, Paaspoortiin gosoota konkolaataa kam irratti funaanamuu qaba?","The correct answer is **B: Baaburootaoo halkanii keessa rafamu (Passport on vehicles traveling to border areas).**

The text explicitly states: ""Baaburoota halkanii keessa rafamu keessatti, hirribaa akka ati hindammaqnetti paaspoortiin nama isa kaffaltii sassaabuun walitti qabamuu mala."" which translates to ""In vehicles traveling to border areas, it is possible to be accompanied by a passport of the person who is paying the fare.""

Therefore, passports are required on vehicles traveling to border areas as part of the security checks mentioned in the passage.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, Baaburoota daangaa ce’an muraasa irratti, Waraqaan Eennummeessaa kee yoom sakatta’amuu mala?","The correct answer is **A: Erga Baabura irraa bu’amee (After leaving the bus)**.

The text states: ""Baabura daangaa ce’uun deemuuf yeroo tokko tokko ilaalchi kan godhamuuf yeroo deemaa jirutti dha akkasuma yeroo daangaa darbuun deemtanii Waraqaa Eenummeessaa hojjetu qabaachuu qabda.""  This translates to: ""Even when checking at each stop to get off the bus, they don't just pass by; they have to present the Eenummeessa paper after getting off the bus.""

Therefore, the Eenummeessa paper is presented *after* leaving the bus.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu yeroo turtii gammoojjiiwwan Singaapporitti taasifamutti akka rakkootti ka’uu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **C: Ho’a cimaadhaan dararamuu (Heatstroke)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Singapore as having high humidity and heat, especially during the day. This combination is a major risk factor for heatstroke. The other options are not directly related to the described climate:

*   **A: Saamamuu (Cold)** - The passage describes hot weather.
*   **B: Suuqiin argamuu dhabuu (Losing sight of the crowd)** - This is a social issue, not climate-related.
*   **D: Karaan nama harkaa baduu (People ignoring you)** - This is also a social issue, not climate-related.

Therefore, heatstroke is the most likely problem resulting from Singapore's climate as described in the text."
Eenyutu keekota Jarmanii Nyaachuu dhiisuu mala?,"The correct answer is **A: Nama alarjikii muduraawwan qola jabaa qabanii qabu (Someone who has a severe nut allergy).**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that German cakes often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.  Therefore, someone with a nut allergy would need to avoid them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nama nyaata dhuma irratti nyaataman gatii cimaadhaan barbaadu (Someone who wants to eat expensive food on a diet):** The text doesn't mention the price or calorie content of German cakes.
* **C: Nama Chokoleetii hin jaallanne (Someone who doesn't like chocolate):** While some German cakes *might* contain chocolate, the text doesn't say they all do, and many are enjoyed without it.
* **D: Nama dhamdhama kuraawaa caalaa dhamdhama miaawaa filatu (Someone who prefers sweet flavor over savory flavor):**  German cakes are generally sweet, so this wouldn't be a reason to avoid them.



"
Mi’a dheedhii isa kamtu qabiyyee waqtiidhaanii kan keekii Jarmanii jedhamee fudhatama?,"The correct answer is **A: Appilii (Appiliin)**.

The text states: ""Pasterootni Fudura beekamoo dha, Apiliin Pasterii waliin toshamuun waggaa guutuu..."" which translates to ""The Futura Pastry is well-known, collaborating with Apple Pastry for a whole year..."" This indicates apples are a key ingredient and a significant part of German cake tradition.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa dhaamsa kamtu bajata irratti hundaa’uun imaluuf hin gorfamu?","The correct answer is **C: Namoota qarshii gaafachuu (Asking people for money)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...hin kadhatan yookaan bu’aa isaaniif jecha namoota biroo hin miidhan"" which translates to ""...do not ask for or harm others for their benefit."" Asking for money falls directly under this category of asking for benefit from others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hojii adda ta’e yeroo imalaa hojjechuuf barbaaduu (Requesting extra work to earn money):** This is a legitimate way to increase income and is not prohibited by the text.
*   **B: Haala mijannoo ofiif yaada jijijjiiramu qabaachuu (Having a habit of changing one's mood):** This is a personal trait and doesn't directly relate to financial constraints mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Baasii nyaataa fi iddoo buufataa hir’isuu (Reducing food and shelter expenses):** This is a common strategy to save money and is not prohibited by the text.

Therefore, only asking for money aligns with the text's prohibition against seeking benefit from others."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, baajata baay’ee gadi bu’aadhaan imaluun eenyutti ulfaachuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **C: Nama yeroo imalu fagoorraa hojjechuuf karoora qabu.**

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that to achieve financial success with limited capital, one needs to:

* **Plan carefully (karoora qabu):**  The passage repeatedly mentions planning, budgeting, and knowing where money is going.  It warns against unnecessary expenses and emphasizes careful consideration of spending.
* **Be resourceful (wal'aansoo ittiin qabuu simachuu danda'u):** While resourcefulness is implied, the core message is about planning how to *use* the resources you *do* have effectively.
* **Avoid unnecessary risks (yeroo sirriitti daanga'e hin qabne):** This is also implied in the warnings against risky investments.
* **Focus on productive activities (yeroo imalu fagoorraa hojjechuuf karoora qabu):** The text clearly states that the limited budget should be used for productive activities (imaltoonni hin hatan, wanta keessa seenuun dhorkaa ta’e keessa hin seenan).  This means using the money to create something of value.

Option C directly reflects this emphasis on planning to use limited resources effectively for productive purposes.

Here's why:

The text states that the ""Daandi Guddaa Baafaloo-Pitisbargi"" (Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway) is known for being a high-speed route with long stretches where speed limits are not strictly enforced.  The other options are mentioned as features *of* the route:

*   **A: Karaa baadiyyaa dheeraatu jira (There are long stretches of rural road)** - This is mentioned as a characteristic of the area *around* the expressway.
*   **B: Karaan dhiphaa dha (It's a highway)** - This is explicitly stated at the beginning.
*   **D: Tajaajilli mobaayilaa xiyyeeffannoo barbaadu (Mobile phone coverage is demanding)** - This is mentioned as a feature of the area, particularly in places like Pennsylvania Wilds.

Therefore, the only option that isn't mentioned as a feature of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway is that speed limits are not enforced.

"kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu konkolaachistoota karaa guddaa Baafaaloo-Pitisbargi irra imalan irraa xiyyeeffannoo guddaa barbaada?","The correct answer is **A: Haala konkolaachisummaa cimaa ta’e namatti uumuu (The ability to create a high level of safety for motorists)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yoo karaa baadiyyaarra oofuutti hinbarre ta’e, dandeettiiwwan daftee waa bira ga’uu keetii yaadaan qabi: lafa baay’ee gad jedhaa, karaa dhiphoo, marfata dhiphaa hedduu.

This describes features designed to *increase safety* for motorists.

While the passage mentions cell service and the ability to navigate, the primary focus is on creating a safer driving environment. Options B, C, and D are not as directly supported by the text.
"
kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu kaaniyooniingiif barbaachisu?,"The correct answer is **D: Yaalii sochii qaamaa xiqqaa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""garuu jalqabuuf yaalii sochii qaamaa xiqqaa ykn haala dhaabbata qaamaa xiqqoo barbaada..."" This translates to: ""however, to begin, a small body movement or a small body relaxation posture is needed...""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Dandeettii bishaan daakuu (Ability to exhale):** While exhaling is involved, the text emphasizes the *initial* small movement. It's not the fundamental prerequisite.
*   **B: Haala dhaabbataa qaamaa guddaa (Large body relaxation posture):** The text specifies a *small* relaxation, not a large one.
*   **C: Dandeettii utaaluu (Ability to inhale):** Similar to exhaling, inhaling is part of the process but not the initial requirement highlighted in the text.

Therefore, a small body movement or relaxation is necessary *to begin* the Kaaniyooniingiin. This corresponds to option D.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu milkaa’ina Kaaniyooniingiif dirqama ta’uu mala?,"The correct answer is **D: Dandeettii bishaan daakuu (Ability to swim)**.

Here's why:

* The text describes Kaaniyooniingi (cannibalismi) as a practice where a person is thrown into water, either a lake or river. The key to survival and the act itself involves the person being able to swim and stay afloat. 
* Option D, ""Dandeettii bishaan daakuu"" directly translates to ""Ability to swim"" and is therefore the most relevant skill.
* While other options might be beneficial, they aren't *essential* for the act of Kaaniyooniingi itself.  

Therefore, the ability to swim is the fundamental skill needed to participate in this practice as described."
"kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, nama konkolaataa isaa keessa buufachuu karoorseef maaltu gargaaruu danda’a?","The correct answer is **A: Hanga dandeettii konkolaataa kee sirriitti hubachuu (Understanding your car's capabilities)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that people often overestimate their car's capabilities and use it for purposes it's not designed for. It specifically mentions using it for personal gain or to transport more than it can safely handle.  Therefore, understanding the car's limitations (like weight capacity, towing capacity, etc.) is crucial to avoid unsafe situations and potential damage.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Konkolaataa teessumni isaa ciisuuf eyyemu (Trying to push your car to its limits):** This is precisely what the text warns *against*.
* **C: Dunkaana (Financial burden):** While financial burden is a consequence of misusing a car, the core problem is the unsafe and potentially damaging behavior.
* **D: Qabeenya dhuunfaa qubachuuf ta’u (Using it to transport personal belongings):**  The text implies this is problematic *if* the car is overloaded.  It's not the fundamental issue.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, konkolaataa keessa buufattoonni yoo Raadaaricha jala turuuf yaadan maal hir’isuutu mala?","The correct answer is **A: Konkolaataa guddaa kan akka SUV yookiin Miinivaanii oofuu (Owning a larger vehicle like an SUV or Minivan)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a larger vehicle (like an SUV or Minivan) is more prone to being targeted for theft because it's more valuable to thieves. The other options are either not directly related to the passage's point about why certain vehicles are targeted, or are stated as negative consequences of using a vehicle, not reasons for being targeted.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, eenyutu yeroo lammataaf Kaasabilaankaa ijaare?","The correct answer is **B: Daldaltoota Ispeen**.

The text states: ""Poorchugiiz kan diiganii fi kirkira lafaa bara 1755 booda dhiisanii deemuu qofaaf maqaa Kaasaa Bilaankaa jedhuun deebisanii ijaaran. sulxaanni Morookoo magaalattii haala haaraan akka Daaru Ibaadiyaa tti irra deebi’ee ijaare, maqaan Kaasabilaankaa jedhamu daldaltoota Ispeenii kan daldala isaani achitti bu'uureffataniin kenname.""

This translates to: ""The Portuguese, after abandoning it and establishing a settlement from 1755 onwards, only called it White Castle and left. The Moroccan sultans returned to the area and occupied it, and the name Casablanca was given by the Spanish merchants who had their settlements there.""



"
Eeenyutu balaa uumamaa itti aansee magaala ammayyaa Kaasabilaancaa kuffise?,"The correct answer is **B: Poorchugiiz**.

The text states: ""Warri Poorchugiiz kan diiganii fi kirkira lafaa bara 1755 booda dhiisanii deemuu qofaaf maqaa Kaasaa Bilaankaa jedhuun deebisanii ijaaran."" This translates to: ""The Portuguese, after abandoning their explorations and discoveries from the year 1755 onwards, returned and renamed it Casa Blanca."""
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Sintraan namoota biyyaa alaa irraa akkamitti beekamtii argatte?","The correct answer is **A: Kabo da Rooka**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Konkolaataan fe’umsa ummataa Skootaarbi 403 idileedhan gara Siintiraa imala, Rookaatti dhaabbata."" This translates to ""The Scottish people's heroic fleet of 403 ships sailed to Sintra, and Rooka conquered it.""  It's then mentioned that this event brought Sintra to the attention of foreigners.

The other options are mentioned in the passage, but not as the primary reason for Sintra's fame among foreigners:

* **B: Bakka fakkii Maariyaa (The Sanctuary of Mary):** While a significant site, it's not presented as the immediate reason for international recognition.
* **C: Keessa deebii qajeelaa Mootii Baayiroon (Lord Byron's special return):** This is mentioned, but not as the primary catalyst for foreign knowledge of Sintra.
* **D: Seenaa jaalalaati (Love story):**  While Sintra is described as a ""love city,"" this isn't explicitly stated as the reason foreigners became aware of it.



Therefore, the passage points to the Scottish fleet and Rooka's conquest as the key event that made Sintra known to foreigners.



"
Armeeniyaadhaan maaltu hin beekamne?,"The correct answer is **A: Naannoo Nagornoo-Karabaki**.

The text states: ""Armeeniyaamti illee beekamtii hin kennineef."" which translates to ""Armenia itself did not provide any information."" The question asks what Armenia didn't know. The context clearly indicates they didn't provide information *about* the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
"
Maaltu walitti dhufeenya Azerbajaan fi Armeeniyaa gidduu jiru irratti dhiibbaa geessisuu itti fufe?,"The correct answer is **D: Naannoo Nagorno-Karabaki**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that in 1994, Armenian guests occupied the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which was part of Azerbaijan. This occupation is the core issue that led to the conflict and strained relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Armeeniyaanota Azerbajaan keessa jiraatan (Armenians living in Azerbaijan):** While the situation of Armenians in Azerbaijan is a factor in the broader relationship, the *immediate* trigger for the conflict in 1994 was the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*   **B: Lola bara 1994 (The year 1994):** The year itself isn't the cause, but rather the year the event (occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh) that caused the conflict occurred.
*   **C: Waliigaltee Dippilomaatii (Diplomatic negotiations):** The diplomatic negotiations *failed*, leading to a breakdown in relations, but the underlying issue was the territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh.



"
"Yeroo geejjiba gara Chaarlootteetti qabatanitti, maaltu kaffaltii dabalataaf saaxiluu danda’a?","The answer is **A: Naannoo biraa jiraachuu (Living in a different region)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Charlotte's family doesn't use taxis and has a large number of family members. It also mentions that the high demand for Charlotte's family has led to significant penalties, exceeding what they were initially required to pay. 

Option A, ""Living in a different region,"" is the most logical explanation for the increased penalties and difficulties in Charlotte's family's life. The text implies that the demand and consequences are related to their geographic location.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Imaltoota sadii qabaachuu (Having four properties):** While owning multiple properties *could* contribute to financial strain, the text emphasizes the consequences exceeding what they were initially required to pay, suggesting a larger issue than just property ownership.
* **C: Gara magaalaatti ol deemuu (Moving to a city):** The text doesn't mention any movement to a city.
* **D: Maatii guutuu ta’uu (Being a large family):** The text states they are a large family, but the penalties and consequences seem more related to their *location* and the demand for their family's services than just the number of family members.



Therefore, the most plausible reason for Charlotte's family facing increased penalties and difficulties is that they are operating in a different region where the demand for their services is high and potentially exceeding regulations."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, ijoollee wajjin Chaarlootttee keessa jiraachuu keessatti maaltu akka rakkinaatti ilaalamuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **A: Kaffaltii manaa (Housekeeping)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Maatiiwwan Chaarlootii walumaa galatti Taaksii hin fayyadamaan, ta’us haala addaa ta’e keessatti itti fayyadamuu. Imaltoota 2 caalaa waan fe’eef, adabbii olaanaa adabama, kunimmoo kan barbaadamuun caalaa qaala’aadha.""

This translates to: ""Charlotte's families generally don't use taxis, but in exceptional circumstances, they use them. They face exceptional punishment for doing even two things, and are even more scolded than they deserve.""

The ""two things"" that incur such punishment and scolding are implied to be related to the upkeep and management of the house, essentially *housekeeping*.  The text implies that any deviation from the norm of not using taxis or doing other things related to household management leads to harsh consequences for the children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Taaksii qabachuu (Taking a taxi):** The text states they generally don't use taxis, but *do* use them in exceptional circumstances. It's the *frequency* or reasons for taxi use that cause problems, not taxi use itself.
* **C: Jiraattota naannoo biroo irraa (People from other regions):** The text doesn't mention anything about people from other regions.
* **D: Magaalichatti bohaaruu yaaluu (Wanting to live in the city):** The text doesn't mention anything about wanting to live in the city.

"Poorchugaalotni osoo hin dhufiin dura, eenyutu kaaba Chiilii to’atee ture?","The correct answer is **A: Mapuche**.

The text states: ""Osoo jaarraa 16ffaa keessa ummanni Ispaanish hin dhufin dura, Chiiliin kaabaa bulchiinsa Inkaa jala yeroo turtetti dhalattoonni Arookaaniyaa (Mapuche) walakkaa fi kibba Chiilii qabattee turte."" This translates to ""Before the 16th century, before the Spanish population arrived, the people of Araukania (Mapuche) held the north and south of Chile while the Inca administration was in power.""
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa bara 1810tti hin raawwanne?","The correct answer is **C: Lolli Neeppaaliyoon raawwatamaa ture (Nepali Loyalists were active)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""waggootaaf hanbise xumura argachiisuun (until the end of the war), **Nepali Loyalists were active** (waraanota Neepaaliyoon kan Ispeeniin mootummaa giddu galeessaa haboo qabu malee).""  This means they were active *before* 1810.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mootummaan giddu-galeessaa hin turre (There was no neutral government):** The passage mentions the Neapolitan government playing a role in the conflict between Spain and Chile, so a neutral government *was* present.
* **B: Chiiliin Ispaanishiin mo’attee turte (Chile had already declared independence from Spain):** The passage clearly says Chile's independence was *not* achieved until 1810.
* **D: Chiiliin Birmadummaa labsite (Chile achieved sovereignty):** Chile did not achieve sovereignty until 1810.



Therefore, the only statement that was *not* true by 1810 is that Nepali Loyalists were actively involved.



"
Namoonni naannoo baadiyyaa Liguuriyaa akkamitti deemuu danda’u?,"The correct answer is **B: Konkolaataadhaan yookiin Baaburaan** (By boat or by truck).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Karaaleen, baaburri fi bidiruuleen gandoota san wal-quunnamsiisan konkolaataawwan alarraan isaan bira ga’uu hin danda’an.""  This translates to: ""The roads, trucks, and carts of those villages are not able to reach them by road.""  This implies that the only ways to reach those villages are by boat (""konkolaataadhaan"") or cart/wagon (""baaburaan"").
"
Jechi Itaalii “Chiinkuwee Teeree” maal ibsa?,"The correct answer is **C: Qarqara galaanaa shan** (Four Skull Villages).

The text explicitly states: ""Chiinkuwee Teeree, kan hiiki isaa Lafawwan Shan jedhu..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, whose meaning is Four Skull...""  The context further clarifies that these villages are known for their skull-shaped appearance. Therefore, ""Lafawwan Shan"" refers to ""Four Skulls,"" and ""Chiinkuwee Teeree"" translates to ""Four Skull Villages.""
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, gosa kophee kamtu lafa mucucaataa yeroo gaannaatiif ta’a?","The correct answer is **C: kophee koomee dheeraa qabu (Coffee with a thick crema)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the characteristics of coffee that is good for preventing liver disease. It specifically mentions:

*   **Thick crema (koomee dhiphaa):**  ""Boottiin tokko tokkoo quuqqaa qabu akkasumas quuqqaa meeshalee nama mucuceessu irratti dabalamu, kophee fi boottii bayyeedhaaf filaatamoodha, koomeef ykn koomeef jala kopheef. Koomeen gadi bu’aaf fi bal’aa ta’uu qaba."" (Each cup has a thick crema, and it's placed on the surface of the coffee, for brewed coffee.)
*   **Crema that remains for a long time:** The description emphasizes the crema being ""gadi bu’aaf fi bal’aa ta’uu qaba."" (thick and persistent)
*   **Coffee with a certain amount of sediment:** The passage mentions ""Cirraachi, dhagaan fooyyee qabu yookaan ashaboon (kaalshiyeem kiloorayidii) akka miilli namaa lafa yookaan karaa darbaa qabatuuf yeroo hedduu karaa irratti firfirfama."" (Sediment, or calcium chloride, which can cause the liver or bile ducts to have a lot of firfirfama on the way.)

Therefore, coffee with a thick crema (koomee dhiphaa) is the best choice as it aligns with the description of beneficial coffee characteristics in the passage.

"
Kanneen keessaa kamtu yeroo gannaa harkisa karaa cabbii irraa fooyyessuuf hin gargaaru?,"The correct answer is **A: Soogidda (Spices)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a condition where the arteries are blocked by fatty deposits and cholesterol. The symptoms indicate a build-up of plaque and potential calcium deposits.  The question asks what *wouldn't* help reduce this blockage.

* **Dhagaa fooyyee qabu (High fiber):** High fiber helps lower cholesterol, which is beneficial.
* **Biyyee suphee (Garlic):** Garlic has been shown to have cardiovascular benefits.
* **Bishaan (Fruits):** Fruits are generally healthy and contribute to good cardiovascular health.
* **Soogidda (Spices):** While some spices *might* have minor benefits, they are not a primary treatment for arterial blockage caused by cholesterol.  In fact, some spices can be high in sodium, which is detrimental in this scenario. The text doesn't suggest spices are helpful and implicitly implies they wouldn't reduce the blockage.

Therefore, spices are the least likely to help reduce the blockage and might even be counterproductive.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Hawaayii waliin zoonii sa’atii walfakkaatu keessaa jiraachuu isaaniitiin, cittuuwwan kunniin aal tokko tokkoo akka “Hawaayii down under” tti yaadamu."" (Along with Hawaii, their shared time zone is why these islands are called ""Hawaii down under"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lamaanuu hoteelota guguddoo hedduu qabu:** The passage states the opposite - hotels and tourism *didn't exist* before the islands gained autonomy.
* **B: Lamaanuu birmadummaa hin qabani:** The passage doesn't mention whether they are independent or not.
* **D: Lamaanuu magaalaa kamiyyuu hin qabani:** While the islands are made up of 15 different landmasses without a single capital city, this isn't the *primary* reason they are compared to Hawaii; the shared time zone is the key comparison.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu sirriitti Ayislaandii Cook hin ibsu?,"The correct answer is **C: Magaalonni guddoon ishee Raarootoongaa fi Aytutakii dha**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the two largest atolls are Rarotonga and Aitutaki, but it *doesn't* say they are major cities. It refers to them as atolls, which are coral islands.
* The passage *does* mention the other options:
    * **A: Hawaayii gaditti xiqqoo dha** - The passage mentions being nicknamed ""Hawaii down under"" and having time zone similarities with Hawaii.
    * **B: Walitti qabama Odolawwanii dha** - The passage explicitly states the total land area and the number of islands within the double-island chain.
    * **D: Biyyi odolaa kun Hawaayii wajjin akkaataa lakkaawii sa’aatii wal-fakkaataa waliin qooddatu** - The passage directly mentions the time zone similarity with Hawaii.

The other options are stated to only offer a parking area and not a place to rest."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Yoo bakka liqii kaashii fayyadamuu barbaadde, eyyema bakka dhaabbii konkolaataa eessatti qabsiifachuu dandeessa?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sirenan dhabbata reenjarii tokkicha bakka ciisicha fi nyaata ho’aa bakka buufataatti dabalatan kennudha."" This translates to ""Sirena provides a ranger's tab (presumably a payment method) in addition to the parking and food area.""  This means Sirena is the place where you can pay for parking using a cash card.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Poortoo Jimeenezii:**  Only accepts cash, not cards.
*   **KaafeeNeet El Sool:**  Offers a temporary parking service with a fee, but doesn't mention accepting cash cards.
*   **La Leona:** Only offers parking and doesn't accept cash cards.

The text explicitly states: ""isaan boodarraa tabba asi gadi ijaajjuu irrattidha, muka cimaa ittiin mucucaataniifi kophee cimaa barbaadu."" which translates to ""From then on, they place the tobacco on the ground below the tree, and use a wooden mortar and pestle to grind it and make coffee.""  The phrase ""dugdatti-baachuun cabbii irra mucucaachuu"" (grinding tobacco with a mortar and pestle) is the action that leads to the tobacco being placed on the ground below the tree.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kophee xaawulaa cabbii irraatiin deemuu** (Making coffee from roasted tobacco) is a result of the process, not where the tobacco is placed initially.
* **B: Mucucoo cabbii baadiyyaa fagoo** (Wild tobacco from the countryside) is a type of tobacco, not where it's placed.
* **C: Meeshaa ofiin baattachuun gaara ba’uu** (Arriving by oneself) is irrelevant to the location of the tobacco.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, bakka hojjettootaan hin eegamnetti warra cabbii irra mucucaataniif saffisaa olaanaa isaanii qaqqabuuf maaltu isaan gargaaruu mala?","The correct answer is **C: Haala mijataa (Pleasant weather)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the coffee pickers work best in pleasant weather. It compares their route to a ""mill road"" and says they can work longer hours in good weather than in bad weather. The passage also mentions they need to sit down and drink coffee/have a meal after working. This implies that a pleasant working environment contributes to their efficiency.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kophee jabaataa (Strong coffee):** While coffee is important, the passage emphasizes *pleasant weather* as a key factor. Strong coffee is a result of the work, not a direct enabler of the speed.
*   **B: Mi’a duugdaa ulfaataa (High-energy food):** Similar to strong coffee, high-energy food is something they consume after work, not a fundamental requirement for their speed during the work.
*   **D: Daandii qulqullaa’e (Well-maintained route):** A well-maintained route is beneficial, but the passage highlights the weather as a more significant factor affecting their ability to work efficiently and for longer periods.

"Imaltoonni rifaatuun irra deebii isaan mudate, maal gochuudhaan yeroo dadhabsiisaa qabaatu?","The correct answer is **D: Aadaa biyya isaaniitti deebi’anii baruudhaan (Returning to their own country's customs).**

Here's why:

The passage describes how people who have been away for a long time and experienced a different culture often struggle to readjust to their own traditions. They've become accustomed to different customs and values. The passage implies that the best way for them to readjust and feel at home is to actively re-engage with and practice their own cultural traditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aadaa naannoo haaraatti baruudhaan (Returning to the Harari region's customs):** While returning to the Harari region *could* help, the passage emphasizes readjusting to *their own* culture, not just the Harari customs. The individuals may have been exposed to other cultures, and simply returning to one regional culture may not be sufficient.
* **B: Nama hubatuu fi obsa qabu ta’uudhaan (Being with knowledgeable and respected people):** This could be *helpful*, but it's not the primary solution described in the passage. While guidance from respected individuals is valuable, it's the active re-engagement with cultural customs that's emphasized.
* **C: Imala biyya biraa taasisuuudhaan (Establishing the customs of the foreign country):**  This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.  The passage implies that importing foreign customs would *further* complicate the readjustment process.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan,rifaatuu irra deebiin addatti imaltoota akkamiitti cimuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **C: Imaltoota haga ammaatti yeroo miidhagaa qabaachuu irra jiraniif** (Immigrants who have been experiencing hardship up to now).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the difficulties immigrants face when returning to their homeland after a long time abroad. It mentions:

* **Cultural disconnect:** They struggle to reconnect with their traditions.
* **Loss of cultural familiarity:** They've often adopted customs from their host country and forgotten their homeland's ways.
* **Lack of support:** They might expect to be welcomed by family and friends but are often not.
* **Hardship experienced:** The overall tone suggests a difficult transition and that they have been through tough times.

Option C directly addresses this hardship and the challenges they've been enduring. The other options are less relevant:

* **A:** While cultural damage is a factor, it's not the primary reason they struggle to reintegrate.
* **B:** Learning about the culture of their homeland is important, but the passage focuses on the difficulties *returning* and adapting.
* **D:** Having little savings might contribute to hardship, but it's not the core issue highlighted in the passage.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa namoonni gadamsa wajjin maal gochuu hin qabani?,"The correct answer is **A: Jiraachuu isaanii ilaalcha keessa galchuu dhiisuu (Avoiding looking at them)**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""Muusonni (akkasumas gadamsaankan bekaman) dhaalaan gameyyii miti, garuu yoo hammeenya itti dhufuuf jedhu hubatan of irraa ni ittisu. Yeroo namoonni hantuuta akka balaa fiduttii hin laalle, baay’ee itti siqanii of balaa keessa galchu.""

Translation: ""Muusons (and those who know the elders) are not a threat, but if they understand that [the elders] will be defeated, they will avoid them. When people don't see the elders as a disaster, they often willingly put themselves in danger.""

The key takeaway is that Muusons/those who know the elders *avoid* them if they understand the elders are defeated. This implies avoiding *seeing* or interacting with them.  Option A, ""Jiraachuu isaanii ilaalcha keessa galchuu dhiisuu"" (Avoiding looking at them), directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Suuta itti siquu (Trying to approach them/to get closer to them):** The text implies the opposite - to avoid them.
* **C: Carraa balaa uumuu isaanii hir’isuu (Reducing the danger they cause):** The text states they are not a threat in the first place.
* **D: Fageenyarraa isaan ilaaluu (Looking at them with fear/awe):** The text doesn't suggest fear or awe; rather, avoidance.



Therefore, **A** is the only option consistent with the meaning of the provided text.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee gadamsaa dhugaa kan hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **B: Al tokko tokko akka balaatti hin ilaalamani** (They don't see it as a disaster).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroo namoonni hantuuta akka balaa fiduttii hin laalle, baay’ee itti siqanii of balaa keessa galchu."" This translates to: ""When people don't see the drought as a disaster, they often willingly fall into the trap (of disaster).""

This directly contradicts option B, which says they *don't* see it as a disaster. The passage implies they *should* see it as a disaster but often don't.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uumamaan bineensa hammeenya qabani dha** (They naturally have a sense of survival): While implied, it's not the primary point the passage is making. The passage focuses on the *lack* of recognizing the drought as a disaster.
* **C: Namni baay’ee itti siquu dhaan dammaquu danda’u** (People can easily escape it): The passage says they *don't* escape it; they willingly fall into the trap.
* **D: Yoo barbaachisaa ta’e ofirraa ni ittisu** (If necessary, they will sacrifice themselves):  This is a possible action, but the core issue the passage highlights is the *failure* to recognize the seriousness of the drought in the first place.



Therefore, option B is the only one that directly contradicts the main point of the passage."

* Translation: ""...the people can punish them by resembling (or other things) the day like the day of the fire. This is severe if the deed is of great value and is punished by a flame in a direct way.""
* The key phrase is ""bishaan qisaasuudhaan"" - ""by a flame.""  This directly links the punishment to fire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhabiinsa uffata ho’aa halkan qorraa ta’eef** (The redness of the burning heart) - While the heart might be involved, the text doesn't specifically state the heart is the source of the punishment. The *flame* is.
* **B: Abjuu guyyaa bishaan fakkaatee itti mul’achuu** (Resembling the day like the day of the fire) - This describes the *action* of punishment, not the source or method of the punishment itself.
* **C: Abjuu guyyaa arguudhaaf annisaa qisaasessuu** (To punish with pleasantness on the day of seeing it) - The text indicates the punishment is severe, not pleasant. Also, it's a punishment for *seeing* something, not related to the source of the punishment.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu imaltoota gammoojiidhaaf akka balaatti hin tarreeffamne?,"The correct answer is **A: Hanqina bishaanii (Tears of the Sun)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gammojjiin hunda caala ho’u, halkran ammoo hunda caalaa ta’uu danda’a. Uffannaan ho’u hinjiru taanaan haayipooteermiyaan balaa nama mudachuu danada’udha."" This translates to: ""All people are prone to weeping, but the strong are more likely to do so. Although it's not from sadness, the hypothesis can harm people.""  It then goes on to say that the ""hypothesis"" (haayipooteermiyaa) can harm people.  The question asks what *isn't* a threat to people.  

Therefore, ""Hanqina bishaanii"" (Tears of the Sun) is the correct answer because it's the only option directly mentioned as not being a threat, and is instead linked to strength and not necessarily harm. The other options – Abjuu guyyaa (day of rain), Haayipooteermiyaa (hypothesis), and Gubaatii aduu (flood) – are all mentioned as potentially harmful or causing suffering.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, gartuu uummataa kamtu dhufaatii imaltootaatiin booda dhiibbaan cimaan irra ga’e?","The correct answer is **C: Tayinoota**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Oddola sanarra jalqaba gosoota Taínos fi Caribe tu jiraata ture. Gosi Caribe kun namoota afaan Arawaak dubbatan, kanneen dhaloota Kiristoos dura bara 10,000 keessa achi qubatan turan. waggoota gabaabaa muraasa keessattidhufiinsa aloolattoota Awurooppaa hordofee, uummanni Tayinosi bittoota Ispeenin baay’inaan hir'atee ture.""

This directly indicates that the Taínos people were the original inhabitants before the arrival of Europeans. The question asks which population experienced a significant decline after the arrival of Europeans, and the passage explicitly says the Taínos population was decimated by Spanish conquistadors.



Therefore, the answer is **C: Tayinoota**.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Afaan kamtu warra caribe ta’aniin dubbatama ture?","The correct answer is **D: Arawaak**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gosi Caribe kun namoota afaan Arawaak dubbatan, kanneen dhaloota Kiristoos dura bara 10,000 keessa achi qubatan turan.""  This translates to: ""The Caribe people spoke the Arawak language, who had settled there 10,000 years before Christ.""

Therefore, the Arawak language was spoken by the Caribe people. While the Dominican Republic later became part of Hispaniola and influenced by Spanish, the original inhabitants spoke Arawak.
"
Tapha skiing akka tapha bashannanaatti beeksisuu keessatti eenyutu beekamtii isaa fudhata?,"The correct answer is **A: Iskii baamsi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mucucoon cabbii sochii imalaa angafa kan namoota itti gammadan, kanneen “iskii baamsi,” jedhamaniin guutedha...""  This translates to: ""The skiing and snowboarding movement of this kind, which makes people happy, is called ""ski bamsi"".""

Therefore, ""ski bamsi"" refers to the people who enjoy this type of skiing and snowboarding. They are the ones who make the activity popular and are known for it.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Noorweeyii:** While Norwegians were instrumental in the revival of skiing as a sport, the text doesn't say that *Norwegians* specifically make the activity popular.
*   **C: Holqa keessa jiraattota:** (People living in the mountains) While mountain people may have traditionally skied, the text doesn't link their knowledge to the modern popularity of skiing.
*   **D: Awustiraaliyaa:** The text mentions the founding of the first skiing club in Australia, but this is a historical event, not the reason people are known for enjoying skiing.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, bara kam keessa yeroo jalqabaatiif skiingiin akka Ispoortiitti beekame?","The correct answer is **D: Jaarraa 17ffaa**.

The text states: ""Gosni Ispoortii gaararraa dachaatti konkolaachuu gosa ispoortii deebi’e kan ta’e jaarraa17ffaa keessa ture..."" which translates to ""The special sports branch returned to the sport category in the 17th century...""
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu addatti odola guddaa Afriikaa Bahaatii wajjin wal-qabata?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhiibbaa Awurooppaanotaa (European colonization)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Dhiibbaa fi koloneeffachuun warra Awurooppaa jaarraa 15ffaa keessa jalqabe..."" (European colonization and conquest began in the 15th century...).
*   The passage also mentions Vasco da Gama finding a sea route to India, which was a key aspect of European expansion and colonization.
*   While the other options are mentioned, they are not the primary or overarching theme directly connecting to the ""odola guddaa Afriikaa Bahaa"" (Greater East Africa).

Therefore, European colonization is the most direct and significant factor related to the Greater East Africa as described in the text.



"
Kamtu amala odola xiqqaa Afriikaa Bahaa miti? ,"The correct answer is **A: Faransayi wajjin wal-quunnamuu (Trading with the French)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Oddolawwan xixiqqoon bay’een isaani biyyoota of danda’oodha, yookiin faransayii kessatti hammatamuu..."" This translates to ""...Small islanders traded with their own countries, or were subdued by the French...""  Therefore, trading with the French is a key aspect of the history of these small islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bakka bashannanaa qaqqaalii hedduu (A place of abundant slaves):** While slavery existed, the text doesn't primarily focus on the islands as slave hubs. It mentions the *trade* with the French, which would include slaves, but it's not the central point.
*   **C: Beekamtii sababa bineensota bosonaaf (Known because of the study of animals):** The text doesn't mention the islands being known for animal studies.
*   **D: birmadummaa uummattoota kan biroo irraa (Subjugation by other peoples):** While subjugation by Europeans occurred, the text specifically highlights the relationship with the French and the trading aspect.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, ayyaanni duaa ka’uu akkamitti manneen amantaa aadaa adda ta’an muraasaan kabajama?","The correct answer is **B: Dammaqinaan Sanbata galgala qopheessuun** (Planning prayer meetings during Sabbath).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Manneen kiristaanaa warri baayyee duudhaa eeggatan, yeroo baayyee galgala Sambata duraa dhuma-torbanii yeroo Du’aa ka’uutti sirna Dammaqanii eeggachuu du’aa ka’uu geggeessu..."" (Many Christian churches eagerly await prayer meetings held before Sabbath, and they organize prayer gatherings to engage in prayer...)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Sirna wal-hormaataa qabaachuudhaan** (Through mutual respect): While respect is important, the passage doesn't focus on this as the *primary* way churches organize prayer.
* **C: Walitti qabamichaaf kabaja waqtii birraa qopheessuu** (Planning a time for collaboration):  The passage talks about prayer meetings, not necessarily collaborative planning in a broad sense.
* **D: Aduun ba’uu ilaaluu** (Allowing anyone to come): The passage doesn't mention allowing just anyone to attend; it refers to organized prayer meetings.



Therefore, the passage directly links the organization of prayer meetings to planning them during Sabbath preparations.

The text explicitly states: ""Paaspoortiin kee guyyoota imalaa keerra darbee yoo xiqqaate ji’a 6 oliif kan hojjetu ta’uu qaba."" (Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your intended stay.)

While options B, C, and D are all necessary for the trip, option A is the *first* and most crucial requirement mentioned for Cuban citizens wanting to travel to Ecuador. They need a passport that is valid for at least six months.
"
Ulaagaan imalaa Ikkuwaadoor maal fa’iif hin kalaqamne?,"The correct answer is **C: Turtii imaltootaa mirkaneessuuf** (To facilitate the return of citizens).

The text clearly states that the Ecuadorian government established this measure to create a smooth flow of movement between the two countries, specifically to facilitate the return of Ecuadorian citizens who may have run out of funds while in Cuba. The requirement for a return ticket reinforces this point.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu biyya ofii caalaa biyya bakkeetti gatii olaanaa nama baasisuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **A: Qorannoo ijaa (Eye exam)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...akka waan qorannoo ija argaatuti yaadii, keessumatuu yoo inshuuransiin danda’eef...""  This translates to ""...as if after getting an eye exam, especially if insured...""  The text implies that an eye exam is a crucial step in identifying and addressing eye problems, potentially leading to solutions that provide significant value.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fireemiiwwan mi’aawoo (Insurance companies):** The text mentions insurance as a *potential* facilitator, but it doesn't say the insurance companies themselves provide the most value.
* **C: Inshuraansii Ijaa (Eye Insurance):**  Similar to insurance companies, it's a facilitator, not the source of value.
* **D: Firremiiwwan maqaa biraandii hin taanee (Generic non-branded fireemiiwwan):** The text says these can be of lower quality and more expensive than imported ones. They are not associated with providing significant value.



Therefore, the eye exam is directly linked to identifying problems and getting solutions that provide value, making it the most appropriate answer.
"
Biyya bakkee keessatti maaltu carraa fireemii gatii qaalii ta’ee bituu uumuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **A: Qorannoon ijaa dabalataa ta’e barbaachisuu danda’a** (Additional eye examination may be needed).

Here's why:

The passage states that frames might be expensive because they are imported and have associated costs like insurance and accompanying files. It then poses the question of why frames might be expensive *within the country*.

The passage directly mentions that a ""qorannoo ijaa argaatuti yaadii"" (additional eye examination may be needed) can be the reason for expensive frames within the country. This implies that the additional cost is related to the eye examination itself, not just import fees.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Ajajichi fireemota muraasaaf fudhatamaa ta’uu dhiisuu mala** (The seller may refuse to accept certain frames): This doesn't explain *why* the frames are expensive.
* **C: Gowwomsaa ta’uu danda’u** (It could be a subsidy): While subsidies can affect prices, the passage focuses on *why* frames are expensive, not *how* prices are influenced by subsidies.
* **D: Inshuraansiin gatii isaa cufuu hin danda’u ta’a** (Insurance cannot reduce its price): This is contradictory. Insurance *can* affect the price, but the passage states it's an associated cost, not a reason for expensive frames.

Therefore, the additional eye examination is the most logical explanation offered in the passage for why frames might be expensive within the country."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa fayyadama qarshii Falklandii keessattii ilaalchisee kamtu dhugaa dha?,"The correct answer is **A: Odoloota fagoo jiran keessatti Kireedit Kaardii fi Paawundii Biriiteen qofatu fudhatama.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Oddolawwan fagoo keessatti tarii kaardiin liqaa fudhatamuu dhiisuu mala, yooma mallaqni Ingilizii fi Yuunaayitid Isteetsi fudhatamuu malan illee; mala kaffaltii fudhatama qabu dursitee murteessuuf abbootii qabeenyaa irraa adda baafadhu.""  This translates to: ""Foreign currency is unlikely to be accepted, although British pounds and US dollars are often accepted. The accepted currency is determined by the financial authorities.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Istanliin iddoo tokkicha Doolaariin Yunaayitid Isteetsii itti fudhatamu dha:** While the text mentions the US dollar is *often* accepted, it doesn't state that *only* the US dollar is accepted in Stanley.
* **C: Paawundiin Falklandii erge Odoloonni sun gadhiifamanii jijjiiramuu qabu:** The text indicates that foreign currency is *unlikely* to be accepted, and any accepted currency is determined by the authorities, not automatically converted.
* **D: Paawundii Falklandiin alatti, Paawundiin Biritish walumaa galatti hunda caalaatti kan fudhatamu dha:** The text states the British pound is often accepted, but not that it's the *only* accepted currency, or that it's accepted above all others.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Yunaayitid Isteetsii gara Faalkilaanditti yeroo imalamu, gosti kaffaltiin Kireedit Kaardiin alaa addatti eessatti fayyaduu danda’a?","The correct answer is **A: FIC kuusaa dhihaa (FIC Exchange)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Falkland Islands' currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).  It also says that while British Pounds are widely accepted, US dollars and Icelandic Krona (ISK) are also commonly used. Importantly, the text mentions that **""FIC kuusaa dhihaa"" (FIC Exchange) is the only bank in Iceland that is known to be able to exchange Falkland Pounds for Icelandic ISK.**

Therefore, if a US citizen wants to use a credit card in the Falkland Islands, they would likely need to exchange their FKP for ISK first, and FIC Exchange is presented as the entity facilitating that conversion within Iceland. The other options are not supported by the text.



"
Sagantaa isa kamtu kabaja feestivaalii mana amantaa wajjin wal hin qabatu?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagantaalee murteessoo mana qulqullummicha hirmaachisan (Activities involving the religious institution's elders/leaders).**

Here's why:

The text states that the festival is celebrated with various activities, including those related to the religious institution's elders and leaders (ayyanneefanna waggaa amantatti kabaajama ykn kabajaa guyyaa dhaloota nyaatan ykn kabajaa addaa kan biroo kan mana amantaa waliin wal qabate).  This directly aligns with option D.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Dhaloota Arbaa (Thursday Celebrations):** The text doesn't mention Thursday celebrations in connection to the festival.
*   **B: Kabaja ayyaana hundeeffama mana qulqullummichaa (Celebration of the entire religious institution):** While the festival involves the institution, the text specifies activities *with* the elders and leaders, not just a general celebration of the entire institution.
*   **C: Kabaja aguyyaa dhalootaa (Birthday celebration):** The text mentions birthday celebrations, but the primary focus is on the activities involving the elders and leaders.



"
Arboonni miidhegfaman eessatti argamuu danda’u?,"The correct answer is **D: Karaawwan Keraalaa irratti** (On the Kerala parade).

Here's why:

The text states: ""agarsiisa dhaabbataa arba miidhagfamee..."" which translates to ""a display of four decorated trees...on the Kerala parade.""  This directly connects the decorated trees to the Kerala parade. The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessa malli kaffaltii balalii Biizinasii yookaan kutaa jalqabaaqusachuuf carraa olaanaa qabu isa kami?","The correct answer is **C: Tikeetii sadarkaa tokkoffaa al-kallattii kutachuu (Sharing a first-tier non-refundable ticket)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the problem arises when you try to *gain access to a higher tier* (like a first-class or business class ticket) *without paying the full price*. The text emphasizes that the cost of a ticket isn't just about the business or initial level; it's about access to higher levels. People are willing to pay a large amount to *achieve a certain status* and *enjoy benefits*.

Option C directly addresses this. Sharing a first-tier, non-refundable ticket allows someone to experience a higher level of service without incurring the full cost. This is the core problem the text describes – trying to bypass the usual financial requirements to gain access to a higher status.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Karaa dhaabbata kee kaffaluu (Paying for your own flight):** This is the standard and correct way to travel and doesn't create the issue described in the text.
* **B: Bakka tikeetii biizinasii kankutaa jalqabaa kutachuu (Sharing a full-priced business class ticket):** While this might be possible, it doesn't directly address the problem of trying to get access to a higher tier *without paying the full price*. The text focuses on circumventing the cost.
* **D: Gatii gadi-bu’aa barbaaduu (Seeking profit):** The text isn't about seeking profit; it's about trying to gain access to a higher status or tier of service for personal benefit.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer because it directly relates to the problem of trying to access higher tiers without paying the appropriate price.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, yeroo kaffaltii tikeetii sadarkaa garaa garaa, barbaacha maaliitu qisaasa’iinsa yeroo ta’a?","The correct answer is **C: gatii gadi-bu’aa (profit)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""balali'iinsa A dhaa gara B tti godhamuuf sababiimti teessoowwan biizinasiitii fi kutaa-jalqabaatiif gatii gadi bu’aan barbaadamuuf hinjiru"" which translates to ""The reason for the cost of A to B is not for the business or the initial part's profit.""

This indicates that the cost is not directly related to the business costs (B), the initial part (D), or the cost of the ticket at different levels (A).  Instead, it is intended to generate a profit (gatii gadi-bu'aa). The passage further explains that people are willing to pay a large amount of money to get a quick result or to be in a desirable place, implying that the difference in cost is the profit margin.



Therefore, the cost of the ticket at different levels directly impacts the profit margin."
"Yeroo kaffaltiin geejiba Afriikaa Kan guutummaa addunyaa waliin wal bira qabamu, maaltu itti dabalamuu hin qabu?","The correct answer is **C: Kaffaltii Viizaa Afriikaa**.

The text states: ""Kaffaltii dabalataa viizaaf dabaluu hin dagatinaa, qaraxa biyya-dhiisanii deemuu, geejjiiba lafaa fi kan kana fakkaatan. Bakkeewwan hundaa Afrikaa ala ta'aan sanaaf."" which translates to ""There is no additional visa fee, airport tax, and similar things. For all those outside of Africa."" This means visa fees *within* Africa are not mentioned as an additional cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaffaltii Viizaa dabalataa bakkeewwan Afriikaan alaaf (Additional visa fee for those outside Africa):** The text explicitly states there is no *additional* visa fee for people outside of Africa.
* **B: KaffaltiiTaaksii biyya gadhiisuu Afriikaa keessaa (Airport tax within Africa):** While not directly stated as *not* existing, the text focuses on the absence of *additional* fees and mentions airport tax *along with* other fees. The phrasing suggests it might be implied that airport tax within Africa is not an issue.
* **D: Kaffaltii geejjiba bu’uuraa bakkeewwan Afriikaan alaaf (Airport fee for those outside Africa):** This isn't mentioned in the text.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, suuppermaarkeetiiwwan filannoo hedduu dhiyeessuudhaaf maal jalqabaa jiru?","The correct answer is **A: Nyaata qophaa’an (Pre-packaged food)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Suuppermaarkeetiiwwan filannon nyaata qophaa’anii ga’aan qofaatti daanga’a."" (Supermarkets are only filled with pre-packaged food). This is the primary reason they can offer a wide variety of choices. The other options are factors *related to* supermarkets, but not the core reason for their wide selection.
"
Dhiyeessii suupermaarkeetiiwwanii kamtu maamiltoonni nyaata qophaa’aa akka bitataniif hawwachuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **A: Mana nyaataa bakka hojiirra (Store presence)**.

Here's why:

The text states that supermarkets have expanded globally, offering a wide variety of ready-to-eat foods.  It also mentions that many supermarkets have their own in-house restaurants, offering ready-made meals, often at attractive prices and with convenient hours. This in-house restaurant presence directly contributes to the supermarkets' ability to sell ready-to-eat foods.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Filannoo gosa muraasa (Limited product selection):** The text explicitly says the opposite – supermarkets offer a *wide* variety.
* **C: Nyaata hin bilchaanne (Uncooked food):** The text focuses on *ready-to-eat* foods, not uncooked ones.
* **D: Bilcheessituu Maayikirooweevii (Microwaveable packaging):** While many ready-to-eat foods are microwaveable, the *presence* of the restaurant is a more fundamental aspect of their ability to sell these foods.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Beeljeemotaaa fi Swiizota afaan Faransaayi dubbataniin hubatamuu dhiisuu kan danda’u kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Jechoota Faransaayii barataman irraa adda ta’an** (Words learned from French that are different).

Here's why:

* The text states that the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland has slight differences in vocabulary (""akkasumas sagaleessi jechoota muraasaas xiqqoo isii garaagara"").
* The text also mentions that French is taught in schools in both countries. This implies that while there are regional variations, the core vocabulary learned is largely the same as standard French.
* Options A, C, and D are not directly supported by the text.  The text doesn't say that the number of French speakers, the way words are pronounced, or the overall dialect of French spoken in France are things that would cause people in Belgium and Switzerland to be unaware of something.

Therefore, the differences in *words learned* are the most likely thing that could lead to some level of unawareness between French speakers in Belgium/Switzerland and France.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa akka Faransaayi keessatti ta’e Beeljiyeem yookiin Siwiizerlaanid keessatti kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Akkaataa sagaleessuu jechoota hundumaa (The way words are spoken)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is similar to the French spoken in France, there are slight differences in pronunciation and a few specific words.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sirna lakkoofsaa (Number of countries):** The passage mentions the *number* of French-speaking countries, but this isn't the key difference being highlighted.
* **C: Afaan waaltawaa Faransaayi mana barnootaatti barsiifamu (Formal French taught in schools):** Both Belgium and Switzerland teach formal French in schools. This is a similarity, not a difference.
* **D: Qubeessuu jechoota Faransaayi muraasa (Use of a few French words):** The passage states there are slight differences in vocabulary, but it's not about using *only* a few words.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the *way words are spoken* (pronunciation, slight vocabulary differences) is the key difference between the French spoken in Belgium/Switzerland and France.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Daandii qilleensaa muraasa qofaatu ammayuu namoota firoonni isaanii jalaa du’aniif gatii gadi buusa, kun immoo baasii imala awwaalaa daqiiqaa dhumaa xiqqoo ishii hir’isa.""  This means that if you book a ticket *through a third-party travel agency* (karaa tajaajila qaama sadaffaatiin argattu), you can avoid the baggage fee.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yoo WestJetiin kan balaliitu ta’e:**  The passage mentions WestJet as one of the airlines *affected* by the baggage fee, not as a way to avoid it.
* **C: Yoo gareedhaan Paariis irraa gara Yunaayitid Isteetsiitti kan balaliitu ta’e:** The origin of the flight (Paris) doesn't change the baggage fee rule.
* **D: Yoo dhaabbata qilleensaa Deeltaadhaan kan balaliitu ta’e:** Similar to WestJet, Delta is mentioned as an airline affected by the fee, not as a way to avoid it.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Haala hundumaa keessatti, kallatiidhan bilbilaan bakka qabaachu qabda buufata qilleensaa irraa."" This translates to ""In all cases, the fare for a deceased person is billed with a ticket.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaffaltii geejjiba awwaalchaa cufuufi** (The fare for a loss of income is sufficient): The passage doesn't mention anything about income loss. It's about the fare for a deceased person.
* **B: Marsaariitii daandii qilleensaa irratti kallattiidhaan galmaa’uu qabu** (A receipt is billed on the ticket for the fare): The passage mentions a ticket *is* used, but not a receipt specifically.  The focus is on the fare being billed with the ticket.
* **C: Kaffaltii imala yeroo gabaabaa keessattii cufuufi** (The fare is sufficient even during peak season): The passage doesn't address peak season fares. It deals with the fare for a deceased person, regardless of the time of year.



Therefore, option D accurately reflects the information provided in the passage."
Meeshaa tajaajila GPS qofaa kennu fayyadamuun mosaajii GPS fayyadamuu caalaa yoom mijataa ta’a?,"The correct answer is **D: Yeroo meeshaa kireeffachuu hin barbaanne (When you don't want to rent a device).**

Here's why:

The passage states that using GPS on your smartphone is a cheaper and more convenient option than renting a GPS device. Option D directly reflects this benefit - you avoid the cost and hassle of renting a separate GPS device.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Yeroo qarshii qusachuu yaaltu (When you want to spend money):** This is the opposite of what the passage says. Using your phone *saves* money.
* **B: Yeroo akka deetaa qunnamsiisu argattu beektu (When you want to get data processing):** While a dedicated GPS device *might* offer more advanced data processing, the passage doesn't explicitly say this is a key advantage of renting one over using your phone. Smartphones have data processing capabilities.
* **C: Yeroo daangaa tajaajilaan ala deemtu (When you are in an area where service is not available):** The passage mentions that if your phone doesn't have data or is offline, GPS won't work. This is a limitation of using your phone for GPS, not an advantage of renting a device.

Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately reflects the primary benefit of using your smartphone's GPS over a dedicated GPS rental, as described in the passage."
"Maaltu mosaajii GPS, Meeshaa tajaajila GPS kennu caalaatti akka fayyadamamuuf sababa gaarii miti?","The correct answer is **A: Yaaddoon tajaajila intarneetii waan hin barbaachifneef**

This translates to: ""Using GPS on your smartphone is a very cheap and convenient way. You can pay for a new map card with GPS, or use a machine instead of one with GPS, or if your phone doesn't have data or is offline. Its functionality is reduced or doesn't work.""

The key benefit highlighted is that it **doesn't require internet data**.  The other options are drawbacks mentioned in the passage:

* **B: Qarshii qusachuu (Paying):** The passage mentions *paying* for a map card *with* GPS, but not that using GPS itself requires payment.
* **C: Kiraa hambisuu (Avoiding rental):** The passage mentions renting a machine *instead of* one with GPS.
* **D: Kaartaa haaraa bituun barbaachisuu diisuu (Avoiding buying a new map card):**  The passage mentions needing a map card *with* GPS.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, doonii mijatu irra akka si ga’e maaliin mirkaneeffatta?","The correct answer is **C: Bakka bu’aa imala Gaalaapaagoos irratti muuxannoo qabu biratti galmaa’uu.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Darwin's observations on the Galapagos Islands, where finches differed in beak shape, were crucial to his theory of evolution.  The key point is that Darwin spent a significant amount of time *observing the environment of the Galapagos Islands*.  This allowed him to see how the different environments shaped the finches' beaks.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Gartuu imaltootaa nama 8+ kan fedha wal fakkaataa waliin qooddattan wajjin galmaa’uu:** While observing the finches was important, it wasn't just about the number of finches. It was about their variation *within* the environment.
*   **B: Yeroo waqtii gadi bu’aa galmaa’uu:** While time spent observing is important, the *location* of the observations is paramount in this scenario.
*   **D: Yeroo dheeraa dursanii galmaa’uu:** The *duration* of observation is important but less critical than observing the unique environment of the Galapagos Islands.

Therefore, the passage emphasizes the importance of Darwin's observations within the specific environment of the Galapagos Islands.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu mala ittiin keessummaa qumaara irra tursanii miti?","The correct answer is **B: Tikeetii tolaa koonsartiidhaan hamileessuu (Getting concert tickets)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how gambling casinos are trying to attract more people. They offer many promotions, easy access, and appealing rewards like food, drinks (including alcohol), and entertainment. The passage then mentions the negative consequences of gambling, including addiction and financial ruin.

Option B, ""Getting concert tickets,"" is not mentioned as a strategy used by casinos to attract gamblers or as a factor related to the negative consequences of gambling in the text. The other options *are* directly linked to the described tactics:

*   **A: Ifa uumamaa baay’isuu (Increasing lighting):** Casinos use bright lights to create a stimulating and exciting environment.
*   **C: Dhugaatii dabalataa (Extra drinks):** Casinos offer free or discounted alcoholic beverages to encourage people to gamble longer and spend more.
*   **D: Dhabamuu sa’aatii (Time offers):** Casinos offer various time-based promotions and bonuses to attract people and encourage them to gamble for extended periods.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, namni qaxalee qumaara taphatu maal hambisuu qaba?","The correct answer is **A: Alkoolii humnaan olii dhuguu (Drinking alcohol excessively)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Bakki baayeen dhugaati alkooli manatti dhi’eessu."" (Many places consider alcohol a source of intoxication).
* **The text also mentions:** ""...akkasuma warreen quumara taphataan kunuunsaan akka turtuu godhu."" (...and people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol are encouraged to indulge).
* **The question asks:** ""Namni qaxalee qumaara taphatu maal hambisuu qaba?"" (What does a person addicted to drugs and alcohol experience?).  Excessive alcohol consumption is a very common and direct consequence of drug and alcohol addiction, often leading to a loss of control and further harm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hamileessa kamiyyuu simachuu (Any pregnant woman is forced to...):**  The text doesn't say pregnant women are forced to do anything.
* **C: sa’atii ilaaluu (Checking the time):** This is irrelevant to the topic.
* **D: Karaa b’umsaa dhihoo ta’e gaafachuu (Giving a dangerous escape route):** While the text describes dangerous situations, it doesn't state that a dangerous escape route is *given* to drug addicts.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is excessive alcohol consumption.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kutaa haasaa kamtu walakkaa himaatti qubee guddaadhaan barreeffama?","The correct answer is **A: xumura (numbers)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xumurootaa fi antimoota tokko tokko adda baasuuf kun mala gaariidha."" This translates to ""This is good for presenting numbers and data individually.""  The question asks which section is used to present data in a large format.  Numbers are presented in a large format (often a summary or conclusion) after the main body of the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maqaalee (Articles):** The text doesn't link articles to large-format data presentation.
* **C: Maqibsaa (Summary):** While a summary *might* include numbers, the text specifically focuses on presenting *individual* numbers and data, not just summarizing.
* **D: Antima (Data):**  ""Antima"" is a general term for data, and the text emphasizes presenting *individual* numbers, not just the data itself.

Therefore, the conclusion (xumura) is the most appropriate answer because it's where individual numbers and data are often presented in a large-format summary.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, maqoota qubee guddaadhaan barreessuun maaltu akka ciman taasisa?","The correct answer is **B: Xumura adda baasuu (Concluding)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Si’iif maqaaleen hundi jecha Saayi waajjin yeroo hundaa qubguddeessaan jalqaba, giduu himaa kessatti illee. Xumurootaa fi antimoota tokko tokko adda baasuuf kun mala gaariidha.""

Translation: ""If a document is always introduced with a phrase from Saayi, it doesn't reach the conclusion. It is bad to bring forth points and evidence one by one.""

The passage argues that continuously introducing points and evidence (creating ""xumurootaa fi antimoota"" - points and evidence) *without leading to a conclusion* is problematic.  Therefore, the primary effect of constantly building up points is *hindering the conclusion*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dubbisuu (Speaking/Discussing):** While the passage implies discussion is happening, it's not the core issue. The focus is on *how* the information is presented, not on the act of speaking itself.
*   **C: Barreessuu (Writing):**  The passage is about the structure of a *written* document, but it's not about the simple act of writing. It's about the logical flow of information.
*   **D: Wantoota adda baasuu (Bringing forth things/Presenting):** This is too general. While presenting points is part of the problem, the *result* of presenting too many points is a failure to conclude.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that continuously presenting points *hinders the conclusion* of the document.

"Kutaa baadiyyaa Maaleezhiyaa keessatti, malattoo isa kamtu “as kottu “ jechuutti hiikama?","The correct answer is **A: Quba agarsiistuu ofitti dabsuu (Raising the hand and placing the palm on the forehead)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Haala falfakkaatuun, Imaltuun Ingilizii ispeenii keessa yeroo nagaa barruu harkaa raasuun isa raasutti galagalee dhaamu dogoggoruu hin oolu (namichi haarkaan nagaan gaafatamee) akka akeeka deebiyanii dhufuutti."" This implies that raising the hand and placing the palm on the forehead is the meaning of ""as kottu"" in rural Malaysia, as it's a gesture of greeting/acknowledgement, while raising the hand and placing it on the forehead is considered impolite.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, malattoo isa kamtu “deebi’ii kottu” jechuutti hiikama?","The correct answer is **C: Barruu achi galagalchanii raasuu (Rotating the head while holding the nose)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that in Malaysia, the ""Bakkoota addunyaa hedduu keessatti, fagooti harka walitti raasuun aggaammii hirriyummaa mul’isa, “nagumaa” jechuu agarsiisa"" gesture (holding the nose and raising the index finger to the forehead, saying ""peace"") *also* means ""as kottu"" in rural Malaysia.  And the text *defines* ""as kottu"" as ""barruu achi galagalchanii raasuu"" - rotating the head while holding the nose.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Barruu ofitti galagalchanii raasuu (Rotating the head while holding the nose)** is the *definition* of ""as kottu,"" not what the gesture *generally* means.
*   **B: Quba agarsiistuu ofitti dabsuu (Placing an indicator on oneself)** refers to the general ""peace"" gesture.
*   **D: Mataa raasuu (Eye of the head)** is not a relevant part of the ""as kottu"" meaning.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, maaltu hallayyaa cabbii gidduutti uuma?","The correct answer is **A: Riqicha cabbii (Cabbage juice)**.

The text states: ""Andaara cabbii sigigaatuutti tuullaawwan cabbii guguddaan kan caccaban jigan, fi andaara isaa irraa ni utaalu yookaan gangalatanii fagoo deemu."" This translates to ""The outer leaves of the pickled cabbage are peeled, and the juice is extracted from it or blended.""

Therefore, the process of making pickled cabbage (sigigaachoon) produces cabbage juice (riqicha cabbii).
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen keessaa kamtu riqicha cabbiitiin dhokachuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **C: Andaara (Leaves)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Andaara cabbii sigigaatuutti tuullaawwan cabbii guguddaan kan caccaban jigan, fi andaara isaa irraa ni utaalu yookaan gangalatanii fagoo deemu.""  This translates to: ""The leaves of the curly kale are also rolled up, and they can come off or be torn.""

Therefore, only the leaves (Andaara) are explicitly mentioned as being able to be damaged by the kale bug.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baqaqaa (Stem):** The text says the stem can become dry and brittle, but doesn't mention it being directly damaged by the bug.
*   **B: Holqa cabbii (Head of the cabbage):** The text states that the head of the cabbage can become dry and brittle, but doesn't specifically link this to the bug's action.
*   **D: Daangaa guddaa (Large leaf):** While large leaves might be affected, the text specifically focuses on the *leaves* (Andaara) being rolled up and coming off."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Imaltoonni yeroo bakka kam daawwatan of eeggannoo dabalataa taasisuu qabu?","The correct answer is **B: Naannoowwan Goomaa marsan**.

The passage states: ""Akkaasumas magaalittiin voolcanoo Naayiraagoongoo yaabbachuuf dabalataan gaarota muraasa akka aafriikaatti bakka argama goorilla bushaahaaf akka buufataatti tajaajilti.""  This translates to: ""Furthermore, in addition to visiting the volcano of Nicaragua, there are also places to visit like African locations for gorilla watching.""  This implies that the volcanic regions of the former Goma area are points of interest that require extra attention.

While the other options are mentioned, the passage emphasizes the volcanic regions and the associated attractions as places where visitors need to be mindful and potentially require extra planning.

kanneen armaan gadii keessaa daawwattoota Goomaa keessa jiraniif odeeffannoo gaarii kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Lolli Kaaba Niivuu keessa jiru bashannansiisaa akka ta’e** (The sight of the Volcanoes in Rwanda is disappointing).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Goomaan hanga tokko nagaa yemmuu ta’u, daawannaan Goomaadhaa alatti godhamu kam iyyuu haala lolaa naannoo kutaa biyyaa Kiivuu Kaabaa keessatti adeemsifamu hubachuuf qorannoon irratti adeemsifamuu qaba. Akkasumas magaalittiin voolcanoo Naayiraagoongoo yaabbachuuf dabalataan gaarota muraasa akka aafriikaatti bakka argama goorilla bushaahaaf akka buufataatti tajaajilti.""

This translates to: ""...Even though it's supposed to be peace, the sightseeing beyond the Volcanoes in the province of Rwanda, in the area of the Virunga Mountains to the north, needs to be understood through research. Also, in the city, besides viewing the Nyiraagongoo volcano, other attractions like the African gorillas in the bushes are prepared for hunting.""

The phrase ""goorilla bushaahaaf akka buufataatti tajaajilti"" means ""prepared for hunting."" This implies that the gorillas are not in a natural or easily viewable state, but are being hunted, which is disappointing for tourists hoping to see them in their natural habitat. Option A directly reflects this disappointment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gatii madaalawaa ta’een gaara bakka argama goorilla irraa hordofuuf iddoo gaarii ta’e dha** (It is a good place to see gorillas even though it takes a long time to get there). The text implies the opposite - it takes a long time to see them, and it is not a good place as they are being hunted.
* **C: Konkolaattonni mootorsaayikilii Keessa naanna’uuf filatamoo dha** (Motorcycles are chosen to enter the harbors). This statement is irrelevant to the text's content.
* **D: Lolli Kaaba Niivuu keessa jiru bashannansiisaa akka ta’e** (The sight of the Volcanoes in Rwanda is disappointing). This is the correct answer because the text indicates that the sight of the Volcanoes is disappointing due to the hunting of gorillas and the overall situation in the area."
Eeyyamni biyya-duubaanii kan guyyaa jalqabbii ji’a caamsaa yoom eegalamuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **C: Caamsaa 1**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kanaaf, hayyami baadiyyaa jiraattota muraasa qabuu, kan Caamsaa keessaa guyyaa itti jalqaban kamiiyyuu Amajjii 1 dhiyeeffama.""  This translates to: ""Therefore, a rural gathering, which is held on the first day of the month of August, is celebrated on January 1st.""

Imaammata kamtu canyon kunuunsa?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirna eeyyamaa Kan dura dhufe dura keessummeeffama jedhu (The traditional way is the one that is revealed first)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Eyyamaa murtaa’etu jira kan namaa duraa dhufeef kennamu seera kan duraa dhufee, duraa tajaajilamaa jedhuun."" This translates to ""There is a traditional way that is revealed first, the first revealed law.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eeyyamni kan danda’amu Fulbaana 1 irratti dha (The day that can be celebrated on Fulfillment 1).** The passage mentions January 1st as the start of the four weeks leading up to the actual day, but doesn't connect it to Fulfillment 1.
* **C: Eeyyamni kan argamuu danda’u gaaffii deemuun dhiyeessuudhaani (The day that can be seen by asking questions).** While questions are asked, the passage doesn't define the day *by* asking questions. The day is revealed *through* the process of the traditional way.
* **D: Lakkoofsa eeyyamaa murtaa’e (The number of revealed days).** The passage mentions four weeks leading up to the day, but doesn't state the total number of revealed days.

Kanneen arman gadii keessaa gosoota hoteelotaa kuticha keessatti ibsaman keessatti carraan argamuu isaa gadi aanaa ta’e kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Keessummoota biroo sirriitti beekamoo ta’an yookiin baramuu danda’an (Secret rooms or hidden passages)**.

Here's why:

The text mentions that these hotels, prevalent before World War II (19th or early 20th century), were frequented by diplomats and spies. They were known for their elaborate secret passages and hidden rooms, used for clandestine meetings and escape routes. This aligns perfectly with the description in the question about the hotels housing hidden spaces.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Mana dhugaatii kookteelii (Cocktail lounges):** While hotels often had lounges, the text emphasizes *secret rooms*, not just a place for drinks.
*   **B: Bakka mana nyaataatti Ogeessa Nyaata dhandhamuu (Dining room for the chef):** This relates to the kitchen and chef's space, not hidden passages for spies.
*   **D: Kutaalee yeroo dhiyootti haaromfaman (Areas used for secret rendezvous):** While rendezvous *could* happen in secret rooms, the options suggests that there may be areas for hidden passages.

Here's why:

The passage states that hotels during that era (pre-World War II) were known for their luxurious furnishings, including fine furniture.  The passage also mentions the importance of creating a visually appealing environment for guests, especially those who were often dignitaries and government officials.

* **Option A** directly addresses this need for luxurious furnishings.  Investing in valuable furniture aligns perfectly with the description of hotels aiming to impress guests.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Mana nyaataa Ogeessa nyaata qopheessuu addatti qabu (Having a restaurant specializing in exotic cuisine):** While a nice addition, the passage doesn't emphasize the *type* of cuisine as a primary luxury. The focus is more on the overall opulence and presentation.
* **C: Bakka bashannanaa bohaartii galgalaa dhiyeessu (Offering a relaxing pool area):** Pools are nice amenities, but not highlighted as a core aspect of the luxury hotels described.
* **D: Kaffaltii kutaalee gatii madaalawaan (Paying for premium services):**  The passage doesn't specifically mention premium *services* as a key differentiator for these hotels. The focus is more on physical luxury.



Therefore, investing in valuable furniture is the most direct and accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.

The text explicitly states: ""Halli qilleensaa qorraan tarii balaa sirrii isa tokkicha nama hin qophoofne mudatudha. Waqtii qorraa keessa Giriinlaandiin yoo daawatte (gara kaabaatti akka fagaattee deemtuun, daran qorra), uffannaa sirriitti ho’u qabachuun murteessaadha."" 

This translates to: ""The polar climate is the only danger that doesn't harm people. If you visit Greenland during the polar time (as if you were going to the north pole, with a red sky), you have to hold your breath because it's difficult.""

The text also mentions that during the polar night, the Northern Lights are visible and that the climate can be harsh.  This points to the difficulty of the climate, specifically the extreme cold and darkness. While internet access is discussed, it'"

The text states: ""Yeroo gannaas busaa Noordiikii ilaalladhaa. Dhukkuba kamiyyu daddabarsuu batanille, kan aarsan ta’uu danda’u."" (During the summer, look at the Nordic lights. If you start to feel unwell, it could be because of them.) This directly links the Nordic lights to potential health issues for visitors to Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Yakka** (Cold): While Greenland is cold, the text mentions dealing with the cold itself is manageable.
*   **C: Haala qilleensaa** (Extreme cold/Ice conditions): This is also a factor, but the text focuses on the Nordic lights as a potential health risk.
*   **D: Namoota naannoo** (Local people): There is no indication of a problem with the local people.

Therefore, the Nordic lights are specifically identified as a potential health concern for visitors, making it the best answer."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu yeroo ammaa akka galama gabaa giddu-galeessaatti tajaajila?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Bakki magariisicha marsun mana nyaata hedduutu jira, fi waaree booda fi galgalaa Koonsartoota bilisaatu kennama walakkeessa gazebo dha."" This translates to: ""The square has many restaurants, and evenings and weekends free concerts are held in the gazebo.""  The Jardín de la Unión is described as having a gazebo where free concerts are held, indicating it functions as a central gathering place.

While the Alley of the Kiss is a romantic spot, the text doesn't describe it as a place for general public gatherings or events.  Templo de San Diego is mentioned as being the only structure that survived, but not as a current public space. Callejon del Beso is another name for the Alley of the Kiss.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu Jardín de la Unión keessatti hinargamu?","The correct answer is **D: Gamoo mana amantaa durii (Courtyard of the old temple)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""isa keessaa ijaarsa Templo de San Diego qofatu dhaabbatee hafe"" (of which only the construction of the Temple of San Diego remains). This implies the courtyard of the old temple is *not* part of the current Jardín de la Unión.  The other options are all mentioned as existing within the garden.

Yaalii utaalcha cabbii irraa guyyaadhaf qophiin muraasni barbaachisaa dha...""  This translates to: ""A day of peaceful rest, spending the whole day together is enjoyable. A simple coffee is enough for a day from a busy life...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fageenyi garaagara, garuu guyyaa guutuu tokko keessatti xumurama:** While the text mentions spending the *whole* day together, it doesn't emphasize a *long* or *extensive* period. It focuses on a peaceful day *from a busy life*.
* **C: Namoonni haala qaamaa giddu galeessa irra jiran taatee kanatti bashannanuu danda’u:**  The text doesn't limit enjoyment to only those who are tired or stressed.  It suggests it's a good activity for many.
* **D: Haayikingiin guyyaa maatii ijoollee baatamtu qabaniif taatee mijataa miti:** The text *specifically* mentions that it is suitable for families with young children (""Haayikingiin guyyaa maatii ijoollee baatamtu qabaniif taatee mijataa miti"").

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Haayikingii guyyaa yoom qophii baay’ee xiqqaa barbaada?","The correct answer is **C: Ijoollonni yommuu haayikingicha keessa jiraatan (When children are present at the hike)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Roogalaandii fi Agdeeritti yeroo bayyee isaan “hei” jedhamanii waamamu, hiiki isaas lafa muurlaandii muki irra hinjirre kan yeroo hedduu heezariin haguugame jequudha.""  This translates to: ""In Rogaland and Agder, they often greet each other with ""hei,"" and their houses are often equipped with hundreds of heaters.""

Therefore, the text directly links Roogaland and Agder to having a large number of heaters, implying they are ranked by this characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mukkeen qabu (Having houses):** The text mentions houses, but it's not the defining characteristic mentioned for Rogaland and Agder.
* **B: Sululli laggeen qaban hinjiran (Not having a large population):** The text doesn't give any information about the population size of these regions.
* **C: Gaaroonni isaanii baay’inaan diriiroo dha (Their people are mostly cheerful):** While people might be cheerful, the text doesn't connect cheerfulness to being from Rogaland or Agder.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu Noorweey kan ittiin beekamtu miti?","The correct answer is **C: Sulula laggeenii irraan gadee cimaa** (Traditional folk dances).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions:**
    *  ""vidde"" (vast spaces, open places, places without walls, without fences) - which points to vast, open landscapes.
    * ""hei"" (a common greeting in Norway)
    * ""muurlaandii"" (a place where the walls are not covered with curtains, a place often heated by stoves)

* **The text does NOT mention:** Traditional folk dances. While Norway has a rich cultural heritage, traditional folk dances are not highlighted in this passage.

Let's look at why the other options are wrong:

* **A: Lafa banaa bal’aa** (Vast open spaces) - This is directly mentioned as ""vidde"".
* **B: Gaarreewwan irri keessi isaanii diriiraa bosonaan uwwifaman** (Houses with hearths for heating) - This is mentioned as ""muurlaandii"".
* **D: Muurlaandii** (Places where walls are not covered with curtains, often heated by stoves) - This is directly mentioned.



Therefore, only traditional folk dances are not mentioned in the passage.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, naannoo buufata gaaraatti daawwattoonni yeroo kam baay’inaan argamu?","The correct answer is **A: Yeroo cabbii cimaa (During peak season)**.

The text states: ""Waqtiin tuuristoonni buufata gaaraa heedummaatan yeroo gannaa Indiyaattii dha."" which translates to ""The time when tourists travel to India for yoga is during the monsoon season.""  Therefore, tourists are most commonly seen during the peak season, which is the monsoon season (gannaa).

Yoo bidiruu gargaarsa barbaadu arguuf abdatte maal gochuu dhiisuu qabda?,"The correct answer is **C: Tajaajila kee beeksifachuu (Sharing your efforts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people will share their information with you if you offer help and support.  The core idea is to *show* that you're willing to help.  Therefore, you need to *share your efforts* (your help, support, and attention) with others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka’uun gara qarqara galaanaatti deemuu (Saying you're a helpful person):**  Simply *saying* you're helpful isn't enough.  Actions speak louder than words. The passage emphasizes *doing* things to help.
* **B: Namoota doonii to’atanhiriyoomfachuu (Ignoring those who are not helpful):** The passage encourages helping *everyone*, even those who might not immediately reciprocate.
* **D: Warra akka kee bidiruu eegan ilaalcha keessa galchuu dhiisuu (Not paying attention to those who want help):** The passage states that paying attention to people who need help is the first step.  You *must* pay attention.

*   **Listen to people affected by the disaster.**
*   **Ask them for information.**
*   **Learn about their needs and grievances.**
*   **Understand their stories and experiences.**

Option A, ""Gather information from the public,"" directly reflects this key point. The text emphasizes the importance of actively seeking out and listening to the experiences of those directly impacted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Raadaara jala turuu (Stay on the radio):** While radio can be a source of information, the text stresses *direct* interaction with affected people, not just passively receiving broadcasts.
*   **C: Yeroo namonni doonii isaanii qulqulleessan qofa itti siquu (Only wait for people to come to you when they need help):**  The text emphasizes *proactively* seeking out information, not just waiting for it to be offered.

Seenaa kolonii Odolootaa keessatti naannoo kamtu Daawwattoota hawwachuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **C: Gidduu Hoongi Koongi (Middle of Hoongi Koongi)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hoongi koongiin sirriitti daawwachuuf,lafa bishaaniin marfamte sana dhiisaatii faallaa gara laga Koowiloon fuuldureetti ba’aa. Ijaarsi lafa bishaan gidduu Hoongi Koongi irra caalaan fedhii lafa bal’aa yaa’a kaabaa irratti kan hundaa’eedha.""

Translation: ""To secretly observe Hoongi Koongi, the framed animal's body came out beyond the riverbank of Koowiloon. The observation of the animal's body is placed on the middle of Hoongi Koongi, above the Kaaba.""

This clearly indicates that the middle of Hoongi Koongi is the place where visitors can secretly observe.  The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
Bakka kamtu daawwattootaaf ilaalcha hawwataa akka argataniif dursa kenna?,"The correct answer is **C: Odola Hoongi Koongi (Hoongi Koongi Daangaa)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hoongi koongiin sirriitti daawwachuuf,lafa bishaaniin marfamte sana dhiisaatii faallaa gara laga Koowiloon fuuldureetti ba’aa.""  This translates to ""To watch Hoongi Koongi secretly, the bleached whale's remains came to the bank of the river opposite the Koowloon Temple."" This directly links the location where visitors can see it (Hoongi Koongi) with the description of the whale remains.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Buufata doonii Viiktooriyaa (Victoria Harbour Breath):** This is a metaphorical description and not the physical location.
* **B: Hoongi Koongi sirrii (Right Hoongi Koongi):** This is too specific; the whole area is the location.
* **D: Qarqara galaanaa Koowiloon (Koowloon Temple Skull):** The text mentions the Koowloon Temple but focuses on the whale remains and the location of Hoongi Koongi.

Koorichaawwan tokko tokko miilli nama Farda irra jiruu akka sadilii keessatti hin hafneef waan gargaaru maal qabu?,"The correct answer is **B: Qabannoo of eeggannoo (Preparation of what is self-protected)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Balaa dhufu kana hir’isuuf, wantootni of eegaanof dursaanii godhamu qaban fudhatamuu qabu.""  This translates to ""To mitigate this disaster, it is necessary to have things that are self-protected from the beginning.""  Therefore, ""qabannoo of eeggannoo"" (preparation of what is self-protected) is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soolii qaldhoo (Candle wax):** While candles are mentioned as part of early attempts to deal with the disaster, the text doesn't directly link candle wax to preventing the wheel from getting stuck.
* **C: Baattuu leezarii (Laser battery):** Laser batteries are mentioned as part of later attempts to help the wheel, but they are not the primary solution discussed for preventing the wheel from getting stuck in the first place.
* **D: Tasgabba’iinsa olaanaa (Excellent Tasgabba'iinsa):** This doesn't have a clear connection to preventing the wheel from getting stuck based on the text provided. ""Tasgabba'iinsa"" isn't defined in a way that aligns with the problem.



"
Kopheewwan ittiin farda kaachisan keessaa isa kamtu yeroo sadilii fayyadamaniif of eeggannoo fooyyessuuf gargaara?,"The correct answer is **B: Leezarii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""sadilootni muraasni, keessumaa kan Ingilizii, kan balaa irra namaa bararuu qabu kan leezarota dhaabii qabu akka salphaati sadilicha irra butuu si gargaru fi yoo dudubati harkifamee akka irra kuftu."" This translates to: ""Several emergency tools, including English ones, which have laser pointers that can help you find the valve and, if touched, will stop the flow.""

Therefore, the laser pointer is the tool specifically mentioned as aiding in the emergency situation. The other options (coffee bottles, coffee shaker, and baking soda) are mentioned as things people used to try and mitigate the disaster, but the laser is presented as a direct tool for addressing the problem.
"
Imaltoota karaa Walitti-hidhamiinsa gaarummaa wal jijjiiruun taasisaniif maaltu dhiyaachuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **D: Walitti dhufeenya namoota biroo bakka wal fakkaataa daawwatanii wajjin (Interaction with people from similar places they visited)**.

Here's why:

* The text describes a network created by facilitating interactions between people from different regions (walitti-hidhamiinsa gaarummaa wal jijjiiruu).
* The key point is the *interaction* and *collaboration* between these people. 
* Option D directly reflects this interaction with people from similar backgrounds who have also visited.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Meeshaalee namoota naannootiin (Regional people's tools)** - While the network might *use* tools, the primary outcome isn't the tools themselves.
* **B: gatii gadi bu’aatiin balali’uu (Decreasing cost of communication)** - The text doesn't explicitly state a decrease in communication costs as a direct outcome.
* **C: Daawwannaa namoota naannootiin kennamu (Provided by regional people's visits)** -  This is not a direct outcome but rather a *means* to facilitate interaction.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee tajaajila tolaa imaltootaaf kennamuiu kamtu dhugaa miti?","The correct answer is **D: Keessa deebiin simattoota naannoo yeroo tokko tokko imaltootaaf ni eeyyamama.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ergaasi tarreefamni keessummeesituu barreeffamaan fi/ykn marsariitiin kallattiin kennama, yeroo tokko tokkommoo ragaa waliin fi keessa deebii imaltootaan kennamuun ni godhama.""  This means feedback from the local population is *occasionally* provided to the manufacturers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imaltoonni yeroo hundumaa wabeeffannaan namootaa naannoo nii qophaa’aaf:** The passage says manufacturers *actively seek out* the local population through initiatives like computer training and email outreach.  They aren't passively receiving feedback.
* **B: Hariiroowwan muraasni mirkaneeffannaa imaltootaa barbaaduu ni malu:** The passage details several initiatives to *gather* feedback, directly contradicting this statement.
* **C: Imaltootaaf tarreeffamni namoota magaalaa ga’umsa isaaniitti isaan simataanii ni qophaa’aaf:** While the passage mentions outreach, it doesn't state that the feedback is *always* received positively. The initiatives are aimed at soliciting feedback, but not guaranteeing that all will be receptive.



Therefore, option D is the only one consistent with the information presented in the passage."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, keessummaa akkamiitu carraan hoosteelii waliin qoddatanii isa qaqqabuu danda’a?","The best answer is **A: Keessummaa umurii diigdamoota gara jalqabaa (The essence of the early ages of life).**

Here's why:

* **The text highlights a significant disparity:** Hostels are frequently used by young people, even those who are grown-up, but also by very young children. This suggests a focus on the early stages of life.
* **The description of the hostels:** The text mentions that families often leave their children in hostels, implying a need for care and support during formative years.
* **Other options are less relevant:**
    * **B: Keessumaa qofaa isaa imalu (Its essence itself):** This is too broad. While the hostel *is* something, the text emphasizes *who* uses it, especially young people.
    * **C: Keessummaa ijoollee xixiqqoo wajjin jiru (The essence of being with very young children):** While young children *are* present, the text mentions older people using hostels too, making this too narrow.
    * **D: Keessummaa umurii Soddomaan walakkaa (The essence of age related to Sodom):** This option is completely irrelevant and nonsensical in the context.

Therefore, the core essence of the hostel, as implied by the text, is its connection to the early ages of life and the people who are in that stage.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Eenyutu carraa hoosteelii turuu olaanaa qaba?","The correct answer is **A: Jaalalleewwan mucaa reefuu dhalattu of duukaa qaban (Parents with young children)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...yeroo bayyee imaltoota umurniin deemanis argachuu dandeessa. Maatiiwwan ijoollee qaban darbanii darbanii argamu...""  This translates to ""...often, even elderly people can be seen. Families with children are often seen...""

This directly links the presence of families with young children to the frequent sightings of elderly people at hostels.  The other options are too specific and not supported by the passage.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa mala nyaata bilcheessuu kamtu irra caalmaan Jaavaanotaan fayyadamama?,"The correct answer is **C: Sukkaara kokonaatii (Coconut sugar)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Nyaati warra Jaavaa... akkasumas mi’eessituu foolii gaarii qabana adda addaati. **Sukkaara warra jaavaa kan kokonatiiti** akkasumas..."" which translates to ""Javanese food... and they have various delicious fruits. **Coconut sugar** and so on...""

Therefore, coconut sugar is explicitly mentioned as a type of sugar used by the Javanese people. The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Dhukkubni daddarbaa akkamitti faffaca’a?","The correct answer is **B: Dhibee uumtoota (Disease of organisms)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dhibeen hubaan kan baattota akka Vaayirasii, baakteeriyeemi, faangasii yookaan paarasayiiti biroon dhufudha.""  This translates to: ""The disease is caused by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites.""  Pathogens are disease-causing organisms. Therefore, the disease is a disease *of organisms*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Namoota hubaman (Known people):** The passage doesn't directly link the disease to known people. It's about the disease itself.
*   **C: Baakteeriyoota (Bacteria):** While bacteria are *examples* of pathogens, the disease isn't *only* caused by bacteria. It can be caused by viruses, fungi, or parasites too.
*   **D: Talaallii (Communication):** Communication is not the cause of the disease; it's a way to try and find a cure.

Therefore, the most accurate and encompassing answer is **B**."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Maaltu akka dhibee uumaatti hin beekamu?","The answer is **A: Talaallii (Disease)**.

The passage states: ""Warren fayyaa Jaargooni waliin wal hin beektu ta’ee, jechotni faallamuu fi daddarbaa jedhamaan hiika walirra fagoo qabu. Dhibeen hubaan kan baattota akka Vaayirasii, baakteeriyeemi, faangasii yookaan paarasayiiti biroon dhufudha.""

This translates to: ""Warren does not share health with neighbors, and the words inflammation and fever have a common meaning. These unknown diseases come from viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites.""

The question asks what is an unknown disease? The passage directly states that the diseases are ""unknown"" (dhibeen hubaan kan baattota). While viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites *are* diseases, the passage implies that the *nature* or specific cause of these diseases is not fully understood - they are unknown.  The options B, C, and D are examples of *types* of diseases, not the general concept of an unknown disease. Talaallii (Disease) is the broader category.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that web proxies are often used for routing HTTP traffic.** This is a key difference between proxies and VPNs.
*   **VPNs route *all* internet traffic**, not just HTTP.
*   **Option A is incorrect** because VPNs also route all traffic, not just routing traffic through a root server.
*   **Option B is incorrect** because while proxies can hide your IP, it doesn't address the need to circumvent censorship and geofiltering as effectively as a VPN.
*   **Option D is incorrect** because VPNs can help with bandwidth, but they are not primarily used for managing bandwidth usage in the way described in this option.



Therefore, the best answer reflecting the information in the passage is C."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee VPNs fii pirooksiiwwan weebii kamtu dhugaa miti?","The correct answer is **A: VPNiin baandiwiidzii olaanaa pirooksiiwwan weebii caalaa dhiyeessa (VPNs provide more bandwidth than web proxies).**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Yeroo hedduu baandiwiidzii olaanaa fi tajaajila qulqullina fooyya’aa qabu"" which translates to ""They have a lot of bandwidth and more speed of performance"". This refers to VPNs.
* **Other options are incorrect based on the provided text:**
    * **B: Bakka bu’ootni marsaariitii Sosochii hundumaa karaa biraatiin taasisuu hin danda’an (Web proxies cannot bypass all social media restrictions):**  The text doesn't say anything about social media restrictions.
    * **C: Pirooksiiwwan weebii yommuu VPN wajjin wal bira qabaman qulqullina tajaajilaa gadi bu’a qabu (Web proxies have reduced performance when used with VPNs):** The text states the opposite - VPNs offer better performance.
    * **D: VPN qofaatu tiraafika http irra deebiin root gochuu danda’a (Only VPNs can bypass HTTP traffic root):** The text suggests both VPNs and web proxies can bypass HTTP traffic root.  It focuses on the *advantage* of VPNs in bandwidth.

(In the Chicken, Alaska trial, satellite internet facilitated the ability to choose to live in Arizona while still working.)

Therefore, satellite internet is the technology that allows someone to use a phone company's internet service from a different location.

This translates to: ""Often, an international call, which the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) allows them to make, has to be made.""

The passage highlights that for internet-based calls to function, you often need to make an international call to utilize the global network. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the passage discourages using local numbers for calls and doesn't mention PSTN.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa akkaataa sagaleessuu jechoota Itaaliyaanii kan sirriitti hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **A: ‘’rr’’in ‘’r’’ irraa haala gargar ta’een sagaleeffama**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""r fi rr gar gar baaftee duubisu kee hin dagatiin; caro jechuun jaalatamaa, carro jechuun ammoo gaarii harkifamujechuudha."" This translates to: ""r and rr are not pronounced by separating them; 'caro' means beloved, while 'carro' means a well-maintained horse.""  This means the 'rr' sound is actually pronounced by *not* separating the 'r' sound, but rather by making it a stronger, more rolled sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jechoonni baay’een akka barreeffamaniin sagaleeffamu (Many words are pronounced as they are written):** This is false. The text provides examples directly contradicting this.
*   **C: Jechoonni qubee c fi g nama dogoggorsuu danda’u (Words with the letters c and g can be pronounced by anyone):** The text only says these letters influence pronunciation, not that anyone can pronounce words with them.
*   **D: Sagaleen jechoota baay’ee kan gargar ta’u dubbachiistuu armaan gadii irrattii hundaa’eeti (The pronunciation of many words is based on the native speakers):** While native speakers influence pronunciation, the text focuses on the specific pronunciation of 'r' and 'rr'.

Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the text."
kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Ittiin beekamtii Izmiir ammaayyoomuu isheen duraa kan ta’e kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Karaawaan babal’oo (Caravan port)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""bakka gabaa wal xaxaa dha, bakka banaa naannoo gidduti argama akkasumaas gaarotan marfameera. Bakka bal’aa , gamoowwan foddaa fuulle tanafimanneen gurgurtaa ammmayyaa garagaraa baaxii aadaa diimaatiin kan haguugaman,giddu gala gabaa jaarraa 18ffaa,manneen amantaafi maskiida moofaa, akkasumas magaalattiin qilleensa warra Meediteraaniyaanii Awurooppaa qabdi, kan aadaa Turkii caalaa.""

This translates to: ""It is a place where caravans meet, a place where various foreign cultures are found, a unique and well-preserved area.  Especially, the historical heart of the 18th century, mosques, and the Mediterranean culture of Europe, which has more influence than Turkish culture in the city.""

The mention of ""bakka gabaa wal xaxaa dha"" (a place where caravans meet) strongly indicates that Izmir's early fame stemmed from being a significant caravan port. The text highlights its historical importance as a meeting point for diverse cultures, facilitated by these caravans.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Gamoowwan foddaa fuullee (Foreign travelers)** While foreign travelers were present, the text focuses on the *facilitation* of their presence, which came from being a caravan port.
* **C: Giddu galeessa bittaa (Center of trade)** Trade is implied by the caravan port, but the text emphasizes the meeting point aspect and cultural exchange, not just the trade itself.
* **D: Baaxii aadaa diimaa (Mediterranean culture)** The Mediterranean culture became prominent later, especially in the 18th century. The caravan port was the foundational reason for Izmir's early fame.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""giddu gala geejibaa baay’ee gaarii ta’uudhaan...giddu gala gabaa jaarraa 18ffaa, manneen amantaafi maskiida moofaa..."" (due to a very good meeting place...a meeting place of the 18th century, and religious buildings and the Moofaa Mosque...) This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Magaalichi gaara guddaa marsa (The city is a large market):** While the text mentions a market, it's not the primary reason Izmir is known for its *quality* or *unique* features.
* **B: Haalii achii aadaa Turkii calaqqisiisa (This aspect resembles Turkish culture):** The text states that Izmir's Mediterranean influence is *more* than Turkish culture, not that it resembles it.
* **D: Buufata doonii akka Turkiitti guddinaan lammaffaa ta’e qaba (It has the second largest onion-drying facility like Turkey):** While mentioned, the onion drying facility is a specific detail and doesn't encompass the city's broader renown.



"
Jechi haanaamii jedhu ilaalcha maalii ibsa?,"The correct answer is **A: Daraarota cheerrii (Tea ceremonies)**.

The passage states: ""Ilaalcha baayee hawwataa, kan haanaamii jedhamuun beekamu, qaama aadaa Jaappaanota dha erga jaarraa 8ffaadhaa kaase."" This translates to: ""The tea ceremony, known as *hanami*, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.""  The following sentence then describes the early adoption of tea ceremonies by the ruling classes. Therefore, *hanami* refers to tea ceremonies.
"
Eenyutu sagantaa bashannanaa yeroo jalqabaaf daawwannaa Daraarota cheeriif ta’u qopheesse?,"The correct answer is **C: Mootii Jaappaan**.

The text states: ""Jaappaan keessatti, affeeraan sirna daraaraa cheerrii jalqabaa mootichaafi miseensota biroo aristookiraasii naannoo mana murtii impeeriyaalaa qofa hirmaachise geggeeffame."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the tea ceremony movement began with the involvement of the emperor and other aristocratic members of the imperial court."" Therefore, the Emperor (mootii Jaappaan) initiated the tea ceremony movement.

(Because of its religious significance, especially the many holy sites in the Old City, Jerusalem is one of the most visited places.)

While the other options are true about Jerusalem (it's a major city, has a rich culture, and historical sites), the passage emphasizes that its **religious significance** is the primary reason for its popularity and importance.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa wanta Iyyeruusaalem ittiin beekamtu jedhamee kuticha keessatti kan hin eeramne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Seena nama ajaa’ibu (Stories of miracles)**.

Here's why:

The passage extensively discusses Jerusalem's religious significance (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), historical importance, archaeological sites, and its popularity as a tourist destination. It mentions its historical sites, archaeological importance, and places of worship, but it *doesn't* specifically mention the stories of miracles associated with the city.

Let's look at why the other options are partially covered:

* **B: Dhiibbaa siyaasaa (Political turmoil):** The passage hints at political significance by mentioning it as a capital city, but doesn't delve into the *turmoil* aspect.
* **C: Barbaachisummaa karaa amantaa (Attraction of religious paths):** This is covered as the passage talks about its religious importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
* **D: Bakkeewwan aadaa (Cultural sites):** This is covered as the passage mentions cultural exchange and the presence of cultural sites.

The text states: ""Nama tokkoof Abbaltii alaa bituun bu'aa qabessadha, kunis gara paarkoota Afrikaa Kibbaa filataman yookiin kan Paarkii Biyyaalessaa Afrikaa Kibbaa keessa jiran hundaatti galuuf ni godha.""

This translates to: ""Someone who pays an external fee benefits, which allows them to visit selected parks in Southern Africa or within the South African National Parks (SANParks).""

Therefore, the only option that *doesn't* guarantee an external fee is paying the park's fee. Options A, B, and D all involve planning to visit the park(s), implying a fee will be paid. Option C directly states paying the park's fee.
"
Hima isa kamtu paarkii biyyoolessaa Kiraagariin sirriitti hin ibsu?,"The correct answer is **C: Paarkii Afrikaa Kibbaa Isa hundarra xiqqaa dha (KNP is a small part of Southern Africa)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Kruger National Park (KNP) is one of the most well-known wildlife parks in Southern Africa, and it's a part of the Southern African Association of Parks (SAANPaarkis).
* It also mentions that the park covers a large area (19,500 km²) and contains 14 distinct ecosystems.
* Options A, B, and D are all potentially true based on the information provided or common knowledge about the park.

Therefore, the statement that KNP is a small part of Southern Africa contradicts the information presented in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gulantaandhagaa harka caalaa daandichaarra kaka’ameera, akkasumas shiboon sibilaa karaa gulaantaa irratti akka gargartuu gulaantati kaa’ameera."" This translates to: ""A bullet thread is embedded in the ground above the path, and also a civilian shiboow (likely referring to a type of marker or device) is placed to resonate with the bullets on the path.""

The passage further explains that these ""bullet threads"" cause a massive danger for those who don't follow the path. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haala qilleensaa jiidhina qabu (Winter thaw):** While a winter thaw *could* cause problems, the passage directly identifies the bullet thread as the primary danger.
*   **C: Holqa xiqqoo (Small hole):** The small hole is mentioned as having something stored inside, but it's not the direct cause of the danger to those off the path.
*   **D: Shiboowwan sibilaa (Civilian shiboow):** The shiboow is used to resonate with the bullets, indicating it's part of the danger system, but the bullet thread itself is the main threat.

The passage states: ""Hafuura baafachuu dadhabuueegi, akkasumas bakka baay’ee irraangadee eeggadhu, keessattu yeroo jidhaa ta’uu, inni gara waan hamaatti dafee jijjiiramuu waan danda’uuf."" This translates to: ""It is also necessary to be very careful and wait in a very dangerous place, especially during the rainy season, when it can change to something bad.""

The passage also mentions that the stairs have a specific design with grooves and a system to prevent slipping.  The most logical reason *why* people can climb the stairs despite the danger is that the stairs are designed to prevent slipping, allowing them to ascend *only when the weather is calm enough to do so safely*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Guutummaa irraan gadee cimaa isaatti qabannoon harkaa hin jiru:**  The passage explicitly states that the stairs *do* have grooves to prevent slipping.
* **C: Gararraa isaatti holqa keessa darbuu qabda:** While the stairs have grooves, the passage doesn't focus on internal holes as the key to climbing.
* **D: yeroo jiidhaa iddoon irraan gadee cimaa isaa balaafamaa ta’a:** The passage highlights the rainy season as a *dangerous* time, implying that climbing should be avoided then, not necessarily that the stairs themselves are damaged by rain.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Kanneen keessaa nyaata idilee warra Majoorkaa ijoo kan hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **A: Foon**.

The text states that Malli qopheessa nyaata aadaa Majoorkaan includes daabboo, muduraa, and foon (kessattuu kan booyyee) - meaning it includes skin (specifically, pig skin).  The question asks what food item is *not* traditionally part of the Majorcan diet.  Since foon (pig skin) is mentioned as part of the traditional diet, and the question asks what isn't, then foon is the correct answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Daabboo (Bread):** Bread is explicitly listed as part of the traditional diet.
*   **C: Ija midhaanii (Green vegetables):** Green vegetables are mentioned as being eaten with olive oil and other foods.

"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessaa irratti hundaa’uudhaan, hima waa’ee nyaata Hangii kamtu dhugaa miti?","The correct answer is **D: Haangiin hurka lafa keessaa Rotorua keessatti argamuu ni danda’a** (Hangi can be found in Rotorua, where geothermal heat is used).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Boollawwan ho’aan keessatti midhaan bilcheessan Kiraayiticherchi, Weeliingitaniifi bakkeessan biroo irraa iddatteeffamuu kan danda’an yoo ta’an illee bakkeewwan hedduun Rotorua keessaa boolla uumamaan ho’aa, kan keessatti midhaan bilcheessan qabu."" (While geothermal heat-colored rocks can be sourced from Christchurch, Wellington, and elsewhere, many rocks are artificially colored in Rotorua, where geothermal heat is used to create them).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hangiin hurka lafa keessaa boolla ho’isuuf abidda dhagaa ho’aa irraa fayyadama** (Hangi uses geothermal heat to create rocks). This is partially true, but the question asks what is *true* about Hangi, specifically based on the provided text. While geothermal heat *is* used, the passage focuses on *where* this occurs.
* **B: Hangiin dhagaa ho’aa fayyadamuun Weeliingitanii keessatti ni argama** (Hangi is found in Wellington using geothermal heat). The passage says Wellington *can* have rocks colored by geothermal heat, but it doesn't say Hangi itself is *found* there.  The focus is on Rotorua's artificial coloring.
* **C: Irbaanni waadaman yeroo hedduu Hangii fayyadamuudhaan bilcheeffamu** (Many people are often colored by Hangi). This is not mentioned in the passage.  The passage discusses coloring rocks, not people.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa mala beekamaa boolla Hangii ittiin ho’isan ta’ee kan hin eeramne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Gaazii (Newspaper)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the hangi is traditionally constructed by *weaving* leaves together. While string/twine (dhagaa ho’a) is used to secure the structure, it doesn't mention newspaper being used as a material. The other options (string, earth/soil) *are* mentioned as components of the process.

Moloksee dhiiraa yookiin dubaraa maaltu addatti beekuuf dandeessisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Maraa ifaa ta’ee sirriitti golgu uffachuu (Having a bright/beautiful appearance and secretly having a good/cleanliness)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""garuu kankee fidattee yoo dhufte, keessattuu kan halluu ifaa ta’e qabu, balbalarratti monoksee isa dhiiraa ykn ishee dubaraa irraa seeqa argatta."" This translates to: ""However, if she comes with a bright appearance, she is seen with a good/cleanliness in the first place."" The text emphasizes a *bright appearance* and *secret cleanliness* as key factors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gateettii kee golguu (Having a beautiful gate)** - This is irrelevant to the text's discussion of women attracting men.
*   **C: Maraa manneen amantii ergifachuu (Having a house sent by a religious place)** -  This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Marxoo jilba gararraatti hafu uffachuu (Having an appearance on a woman's body)** - While the text discusses appearance, it's not just about the physical body but also the *overall impression* and *secret cleanliness*.



"
Uffannaa armaan gadii keessaa kamtu mana qamantiitii ergifachuuf argamuu dhiisuu danda’a? ,"The correct answer is **A: Marxoo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kunis kuusaa keessaa ergifatamuu danda'a galumsa irratti, garuu uffanni erga itti fayyadammee hin miicamne waan ta'eef, marxoo kanneen uffachuun sitti toluu dhiisuu danda'a.""  This translates to: ""This can be sent in the semen, but if the reproductive organs are not used, the male can avoid having offspring.""

Therefore, the text directly links the reproductive organs (which are part of a male) to the potential for infertility. The word ""Marxoo"" in the answer options refers to a male, and the text discusses the male's role in potential infertility.
"
Daawwattoonni yommuu naannoo Antaarkitikii daawwatan yoom carraa guddaa urjiilee ilaaluu qabu?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeroo Bonaa (During the Winter)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""akkuuma samiin baayee dukkana’uuf ykn gad xiqqaatuf naannoo sa’aatitt carraa gaarii kenna."" which translates to ""just like during a long winter, the region still receives a bit of sunlight."" 

The passage then goes on to describe how even with minimal sunlight, the Antarctic region has a unique beauty and that the short daylight hours don't hinder activity. This implies that winter is a key time for experiencing the unique light conditions and observing the aurora australis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yeroo naannoo sanatti namni hinbaay’anne (When no one is in the region):**  While true that the region is sparsely populated, this isn't directly related to the light conditions.
* **C: Yeroo ji’oota Gannaa (During the Summer months):**  The text describes the light as being similar to a long winter, contradicting the idea of summer.
* **D: Yeroo faalamni qilleensaa gadi aanaa ta’u (When the solar eclipse is happening):** The text doesn't mention solar eclipses.



"
Bilbilli saatalaayitii yoom bilbila moobaayilaa bakka bu’uu hin danda’u?,"The correct answer is **A: Yoo sararri kallattii saatalaayitii dhorkame (If the satellite signal is blocked)**.

Here's why:

The text states that satellite phones require a clear line of sight to a satellite. If there's an obstruction (like a mountain, building, or dense foliage), the signal will be blocked, and the phone won't work.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Yoo naannichii baay’ee fagoo ta’e (If the area is very remote):** While remoteness can *affect* signal strength, it doesn't necessarily *prevent* satellite phone use. Satellite phones are designed for remote areas.
* **C: Yoo bakkeetti fayyadamama ta’e (If the location is not used):** This doesn't directly explain why a satellite phone wouldn't work.
* **D: Yoo saffisni daataa murtaa’e barbaada ta’e (If the data speed required is high):**  Satellite phone data speeds are generally slower than mobile data speeds. This affects *performance*, but not whether the phone can connect at all.

Therefore, a blocked satellite signal is the primary reason a satellite phone can't operate.



"
Bilbilli saatalaayitii bilbila moobaayilaa caalaa yoom filatama?,"The correct answer is **C: Yeroo daataan fagoo dirqama hin taanetti (When mobile data is unavailable)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that satellite phones are used when mobile network coverage is unavailable.  The passage mentions that satellite phones are for areas where mobile phone service isn't available, and they are used when mobile data isn't accessible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yeroo boqonnaa magaalaa keessaaf (In urban areas):**  The text highlights the utility of satellite phones *because* mobile networks are *not* available, not because they are needed in urban areas.
*   **B: Yeroo dooniidhaan deemamuuf (When traveling):** While travel *can* be a reason to need a satellite phone, the primary driver is the lack of mobile network coverage, not just travel itself.
*   **D: Yeroo tajaajila bilbila harkaa gahaa qabaa (When mobile network coverage is available):** This is the opposite of when a satellite phone would be used.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **C**.



"
waldhabbii kanneen armaan gadii kam irratti uumametu uumamuu Riippaablikii Tiraanisnistriyaaf sababa ta’e?,"The correct answer is **C: Afaan (Language)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Transnistria was formed in 1994 after a conflict, and that it's located in the eastern part of Moldova.  A key point is that Transnistria has its own language, which is Russian, and while Romanian is the official language of Moldova, Russian is widely used. This linguistic difference is a major factor in the conflict and the formation of Transnistria. While the text mentions political and economic factors, the underlying cause stemming from distinct language use is the most direct reason cited.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Diinagdee (Religion):** The text mentions the dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity, but it doesn't connect religious differences directly to the formation of Transnistria.
*   **B: Sabummaa (Nationalism):** While nationalism is likely a factor, the text doesn't explicitly state that nationalism was the primary driver. The language difference is more clearly presented as a central issue.
*   **D: Amantaa (Belief):** This is too general. While belief systems exist, the text doesn't link belief directly to Transnistria's formation.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Riippaablikiin Tiraanisnistriyaa kanneen biroo Moldoovaa keessa jiraan irraan waan adda ta’e maal qaba?  ,"The correct answer is **A: Afaan**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Riippaabilikii Tiraansinistriyaa jedhama jedhee labse, kan baha Moldoovaatti geesse, kan mootummaa fi qarshii mataa isii qabdu, garuu kan biyyoota miseensa Mootummoota Gamtoomanii keessaa tokkoon illee beekamtiin hin kennaminiif. **Walitti dhufeenyi dinagdee irra deebiin ijaarameera qaamota kana lamaan Moldoova gidduti kufatii haasaa siyaasa fallaan.**"" This translates to: ""It was called the Republic of Transnistria, located in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any of the Commonwealth of Independent States countries. **The peaceful coexistence between these two entities has been disrupted, leading to a political crisis in Moldova.**""

The text focuses on the *disruption* of peaceful coexistence *due to* differences between the two entities.  While the other options might have differences, the text specifically highlights the **language** as a major factor contributing to the conflict. The Republic of Transnistria has a different language (Russian) compared to the majority language of Moldova (Romanian).

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported:

*   **B: Amantaa (Religion):** The text mentions the majority religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity, but it doesn't state this is a difference *between* Transnistria and Moldova.
*   **C: Beekkamtii Mootummoota Gamtoomanii (Recognition by the Commonwealth of Independent States):**  The text says Transnistria isn't *recognized* by CIS countries, but this is a consequence of the conflict, not a fundamental difference *within* Moldova.
*   **D: Maallaqa (Currency):** Transnistria has its own currency, which is a difference, but the text focuses more on the language and the ensuing political crisis.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, imaltoonni haalli qilleensaa bubbeen akka isaan hin qaqqabne yoo abdatu ta’e, Montevidiyoo yoom daawwachuu qabu?","The correct answer is **C: Yeroo ji’oota Bonaa Heemisfeera Kaabaa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Montevidéo is located in the tropical zone, with temperatures often exceeding 30°C. It also mentions that the seasons of ""ganna"" (summer) and ""bona"" (autumn) are intertwined throughout the year due to the Earth's rotation.
* **The question asks:** When is the heat (bubbee) not so intense in Montevideo?
* **Therefore:**  ""Bona"" (autumn) in the Southern Hemisphere corresponds to the period when temperatures are cooler than the intense heat of ""ganna"" (summer) in the Northern Hemisphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo ji’oota Gannaa Heemisfeera Kaabaa (Summer in the Northern Hemisphere):** This would be the *hottest* time, not cooler.
* **B: Yeroo waqtii gogaa Montevidiyoo (Winter in Montevideo):** While it's winter in Montevideo, the passage focuses on the temperature issue related to intense heat, not cold temperatures.
* **D: Yeroo waqtii Gannaa Montevidiyoo (Summer in Montevideo):** This is when temperatures are at their peak, which is the opposite of what the question asks.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Imaltoonni yoo qilleensi qbbanaa’aan in mijataaf ta’e, Montavidiyoo yoom daawwachuu qabu?","The correct answer is **C: Yeroo Montevidiyootti waqtii roobaa ta’u (During the tropical summer in Montevideo)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Montevideo is located in the tropical zone, and its summers are characterized by high temperatures (above 30°C).
* The text also mentions that the terms ""ganna"" (summer) and ""bona"" (heat) are used interchangeably to describe the hot, humid weather during the entire year. 
* Therefore, the correct option is the one that reflects this tropical summer condition.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo Montevidiyoo keessatti Bona ta’u (During heat in Montevideo):**  While Montevideo experiences heat, the term ""bona"" encompasses more than just heat; it includes the overall hot and humid weather of the tropical summer.
* **B: Yeroo Heemisfeera Kaabaatti Bona ta’u (During heat in the Northern Hemisphere):** This is incorrect because the text specifies that Montevideo is in the *Southern* Hemisphere.
* **D: Yeroo Heemisfeera Kaabaatti Ganna ta’u (During summer in the Northern Hemisphere):** This is incorrect because Montevideo is in the *Southern* Hemisphere.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Barreeffamoonni giraafitii haala kana keessatti taagiiwwan seeraan alaa yeroo baay’ee hojiwwan aartii fakkaatu.""  This translates to ""Graffiti writings in this manner often resemble art projects with illegal elements.""

The question asks what connects graffiti art with the images we see in our cities that don't respect public property.  The passage directly links graffiti writings to ""maxxansa seeraan alaa"" (illegal elements). Therefore, the answer is D.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Barreeffamoota giraafitii** (Graffiti writings): While graffiti writings *are* a part of the phenomenon, the question asks for the *connection* between the images and the disrespect for public property.
*   **B: Eeggannoo malee kaafaman** (Images not received): This is not a relevant element discussed in the passage. The passage focuses on *what* the images are and *how* they relate to public property, not how they're received.
*   **C: Fakkii keenyan qabeenya hawaasaa irrattii hin barbaachisne** (Our images that don't respect public property): While this describes the *impact* of the images, it doesn't explain the *connection* between the images and the graffiti.

Qaama jiloota muuziqaa kamtu hirmaattota muraasaan akka muuxannoo murteessaatti ilaalama?,"The correct answer is **D: Dursanii seenuu (Going first)**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""Gara gochaatti dhiyaachuu yoo barbaadde, bakkee buufataa muuziqichatti dhiyaatu argachuudhaaf, **dursitee seenuudha qabda.**""  This translates to: ""If you want to go to the event, to find a place that is a comfortable space for music, you must **go early**.""

The text emphasizes that getting there early is necessary to secure a good spot near the music. The other options are not directly supported by the text as the primary way to get noticed by the organizers.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, hirmaattonni jila muuziqaa yoo naannoo muuziqaatti siqanii buufachuu barbaadan dursa maal gochuu qabu?","The correct answer is **D: Dursanii seenuu (Go to the front).**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gara gochaatti dhiyaachuu yoo barbaadde, bakkee buufataa muuziqichatti dhiyaatu argachuudhaaf, dursitee seenuudha qabda."" This translates to: ""If you want to go to the front, to find a place to enjoy the music, you must go to the front first.""

Therefore, to get closer to the music, you need to go to the front.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Daawwattoonni yeroo bineensota galgalaa Kaaba Niiw Meeksikootti barbaadan, bakka kam dhiisuu qabu?","The correct answer is **B: Mana dhugaatii magaalaa xixiqqoo (Small-town casinos)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hubadhu; manneen dhugaatii magaalaa xixiqqoon asii daawwattoota kutaa-biyyaa alaa dhufaniif itti bashannanuuf yeroo hundaa bakkee gaari miti."" This means that while casinos exist in small towns, they aren't always the primary destination for out-of-town gamblers.

The passage also mentions that the New Mexico legislature has regulations and that the influx of gamblers has led to casinos booming in small towns. This implies that small-town casinos are a significant presence and destination for gamblers in New Mexico.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate choice based on the provided text.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Daawwataan Kaaba Niiw Meeksikoo keessatti naannoo kam akka bakka bashannanaa sirriitti beekamaa ta’eetti argachuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **D: Mana dhugaatii magaalaa xiqqootti (Small-town casinos)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hubadhu; manneen dhugaatii magaalaa xixiqqoon asii daawwattoota kutaa-biyyaa alaa dhufaniif itti bashannanuuf yeroo hundaa bakkee gaari miti."" This translates to: ""Understand this; small-town casinos are not always a place of excitement for out-of-state visitors.""  However, the passage also says that ""hedduun isaanii ammoo bashannana maqaa beeksisaatiin fidu (hunda dura warra gurguddaa kan Albuquerque fi Santa Fe marsanii jiran)."" which translates to ""most of them still bring excitement by name (before the people who used to be from Albuquerque and Santa Fe)."" This indicates that small-town casinos are a known source of excitement, particularly for those from Albuquerque and Santa Fe. The passage further explains the reason for this: ""Mana dhugaatii magaalaa xiqqoo keessatti daawwattoota kutaa-biyyaa alaa dhufaniif itti bashannanuuf yeroo hundaa bakkee gaari miti. Waanta tokkoof, kaabni Niiwu Meeksikoo rakkoolee machaa’anii oofuu guguddoo qaba, baay’inni konkolaachistoota dhugaatiidhaan machaa’anii immoo manneen dhugaatii magaalaa xiqqoo keessatti dhiyeenyaan olaanaadha."" which translates to: ""Small-town casinos are not always a place of excitement for out-of-state visitors. One reason is that the New Mexico law has loopholes, and the influx of casino tourists has made small-town casinos very popular.""

The passage also mentions Albuquerque and Santa Fe in relation to the casinos, implying these are the locations known for casinos. While the passage doesn't specify *which* small town, it implies that *small-town* casinos are the key.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pueblo fagootti (Pueblo resorts):** The passage doesn't mention Pueblo resorts as a significant source of excitement.
*   **B: Small-town casinos:** While this option seems promising, the text doesn't specify that this is the *only* or *primary* source of excitement.
*   **C: Small-town casinos:** This is the same option as the one above, and therefore incorrect."
Imaltoonni baajata isaanii seeraan qabatan dhugaatii gosa kam hambisuu barbaadu?,"The correct answer is **D: Cuunfaan kuduraa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cuunfaan kuduraa qaaliidha garuu baay’ee bayeessa."" which translates to ""Instant coffee is expensive, but it is also readily available.""

The question asks which coffee type is preferred when people are on a budget. Since instant coffee is ""readily available"" and implicitly suggests a lower cost option compared to other options mentioned (like high-quality Australian coffee, espresso, cappuccino, or tea), it's the most logical choice for someone on a budget.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Daadhii wayinii Awustiraaliyaa (Australian coffee beans):** The passage says Australian coffee is a high-quality, cherished experience, implying it's *not* a budget option.
* **B: Bishaan qaruuraatiin gurguramu (Ground coffee):** While ground coffee can be cheaper than beans, the passage doesn't specifically highlight it as the go-to budget option.
* **C: Biiraa naannoo (Regional coffee):** The passage doesn't discuss regional coffee as a budget option.

"Iddoo kuticha keessatti ibsame irratti hundaa’uudhaan, ajaja dhugaatii armaan gadii keessaa kamtu keessummeessaan adda baasuun rakkisuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **A: Gabaabaa gurraacha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Awustiraaliyaanotaaf, yaadni buna ‘adii battee’ jedhu **baadaadha**.""  This translates to ""For Australians, the memory of coffee 'addee battee' is **dear/treasured**."" 

The phrase ""addee battee"" refers to a traditional Australian coffee, which is essentially a strong, unfiltered coffee made by dripping coffee grounds through a cloth filter (often a ""gabaabaa gurraacha"" - a coffee percolator or drip coffee maker).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lakkoofsa tokko (Number one):** This refers to the name of a coffee blend, not a method.
* **C: Saawuvinyoon Bilaankii Niwu Zilaandii (New Zealand White Sauvignon):** This refers to a type of wine, not coffee.
* **D: Battee adii (Dear/treasured memory):** This is the meaning of the phrase, not the method of making the coffee.



Therefore, the method used to make the Australian ""addee battee"" coffee is using a coffee percolator or drip coffee maker (""gabaabaa gurraacha"").

"Jaarrota sadiif kan ture, Yeroon kolonaayizeeshinii gartuu kamiin jalqabamee ture?","The correct answer is **D: Ispaaniyaardota**.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Karaan filatamaan ittiin Pariisiyaanota ittiin ofitti qabdu maali?","The correct answer is **A: Ilaalcha isaanii fakkeessuu yaaluudhaan (By imitating their behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Parisiyaansiin amala gaariin kan guddifame (bien élevé) fakkessuudha. Kunis nama waliin walii galuun akka haalaan salphatu godha."" This translates to: ""Parisians strive to emulate refined behavior (bien élevé). This makes it easy for people to get along with them.""

Therefore, to be accepted by Parisians, one needs to **imitate their behavior**. The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **B: Ofitti amanamummaa hir’isuudhaan (By increasing self-confidence):** The text doesn't mention self-confidence as a key to Parisian acceptance.
*   **C: Afaan ho’uudhaan (By speaking French):** While speaking French is helpful, the passage emphasizes *behavior*, not just language.
*   **D: Amala of gadhiisuu agarsiisuudhaan (By showing humility):** The passage focuses on *refined* or *elegant* behavior, not necessarily humility."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa amala Pariisiyaanotaa ta’ee kan itti hin maxxanfamne kami?","The correct answer is **B: namaaf dantaa kan hin qabne** (which translates to ""not beneficial to others"").

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Warri Pariisiyaa jedhaman amaloota ofittumaa, kan namaaf dantaa hin qabneefi amala oftuuluu qabaachuun addatti beekamu."" This translates to ""The Parisians are known for their self-centered ways, and for valuing sophisticated behavior that isn't beneficial to others.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Of tuulummaa** (Self-centeredness) - The passage directly mentions self-centeredness.
*   **C: Xaxxabachuu** (Being rude) - While the passage implies Parisians can be rude if you're not socially adept, it doesn't explicitly say rudeness is a defining characteristic.
*   **D: Ariifachuu** (Being knowledgeable) - The passage doesn't mention knowledge or being knowledgeable as a characteristic of Parisians.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is that **being not beneficial to others** is a characteristic of Parisians that is highlighted and emphasized."
Faayidaan kutaa tokkoffaa baabura magaalaa Keeptaawon maali?,"The correct answer is **A: Bakki taa’umsaa fuuldura baaburichaatti argama (It is found at the entrance of the train station).**

The passage states: ""Meetiroopilaasii dhumma baabura irrattidha yeroo hundaa kan gorsu dhi’eenya naannoo Keepi Taawonitti."" This translates to ""Metropilas is at the entrance of the train, always sold at the Keep Town regional office.""  Therefore, the Metropilas (first part) is located at the entrance of the train station.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Namni hagas mara hin baay’atu (Nobody goes there often):** The passage doesn't say this.
* **C: Tikeetii kutaa sadaffaa gaditti rakasa dha (It is where tickets for the third part are sold):** This is incorrect; the third part is called ""Meetiroo"" and the passage doesn't say the Metropilas sells tickets for it.
* **D: Tikeetii meetroo wajjin gatiin isaa walfakkaataa dha (It is proportional to the price of the metro ticket):** The passage doesn't discuss the price relationship.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that each of the seven subway lines in Keep Town has both a Metropilas (first part) and a Metro (third part). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakka taa’umsaa badaa walitti hintuutamne (The locations are not connected):**  The text implies they are connected, as each line *has* both parts. It doesn't say they are disconnected.
* **B: Gatii tikkeetii walfakkaataa sadarkaa lamaaniif (A joint ticket for two levels):** The text mentions a ticket similar to those in Europe, but it doesn't say it's a joint ticket for different levels.
* **C: Kutaa garaagaraa sadii (Four distinct parts):**  The text clearly states there are *three* parts: Metropilas and Metro (which is divided into three sections).

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa bineensotni nama miidhan maal hin godhan?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhibee daddabarsuu (Causing illness)**.

The text states: ""Dhukkuboonni daddarboon ofii isaanii yookiin beeyladooti balaafamoon humnaan nama miidhuu yookaan nama ajjeesuu danda’an..."" which translates to ""Severe illnesses of themselves or infected animals can injure or kill people violently...""  This directly points to the ability to cause illness.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Rifaatuu qaamaa fiduu (Being a vector):** While some animals *are* vectors (carry diseases), the text doesn't focus on *being* a vector as the main cause of harm.
*   **B: Alerjii fiduu (Causing allergies):** Allergies are a type of illness, but the text emphasizes more severe, potentially deadly illnesses.
*   **D: Miidhama humna cimaan geessisuu (Causing violent injury):**  The text says they *can* injure or kill violently, but the primary focus is on the spread of illness, not direct physical violence.

The text explicitly states: ""Yeroo kaardiiwwan hedduun iddoo hunda bilbiluuf gaarii ta’anitti tokko tokko garee biyyoota murtaa’aniitiif dhiheessa bilbila addaa qaba.""

*   **Eegee cocorree** (Lynx)
*   **Adaalaa** (Brown Bear)
*   **Kaapperkalii** (Wild Lynx)

Therefore, all the options listed are found in the park. However, the question asks which of the following are found in the park. All the choices are indeed found in the park based on the text. 

Without further clarification on what the question is specifically asking, any of the options could be considered correct. However, since there is no additional context, I will choose **B: Adurree daggalaa** as a valid answer.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Koodiin naannoo maaliif fayyadu?","The correct answer is **A: Diiskiitti galagashuuf (To access a disk)**.

The text states: ""sutaa-suutan- diiskiitti galagalchuun meeshaa kamuu kan inni jalqabaa taphatu irratti akka sirriiti taphatu gochuu danda’a"" which translates to ""Accessing a disk with a region code allows it to be played as if it were the original disc.""

Therefore, the region code is used for accessing disks.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee koodii naannoo miidiyaa hawaasaatiin hasa’amuu soba ta’e kami?","The correct answer is **A: To’annaa gabaa caalaattii argachuuf dirqama barbaachisu** (It requires effort to find a clear background).

Here's why:

* The text states that the main challenge for campaign media is to make the content stand out and be easily understandable. 
* The key issue is that the ""local code"" (likely referring to restrictions or complexities in media) can make it difficult to achieve a clear and visually appealing background. 
* To overcome this, effort (""dirqama"") is needed to find a clear background that doesn't distract from the message.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Galagalcha seeraan alaa hambisu** (Hiding external legal restrictions): While related to the challenges, the text doesn't explicitly state that the goal is to hide legal restrictions. It's more about the difficulty those restrictions create.
* **C: Bu’aa buufachuuf ni fayyadu** (It is used for entertainment): The text focuses on the *difficulty* in achieving clear communication, not entertainment.
* **D: Saamicha darbanii darbanii ittisu** (Repeatedly eliminating errors): While error correction is important, the text's primary point revolves around the challenge of background clarity due to media constraints.



"
"Yemmuu biyya kee geessu, adeemsa kamtu al-idilee dha?","The correct answer is **D: To’annaa gumurukii**.

Here's why:

The question asks what non-traditional service is offered when a country is in crisis, and the traditional food (yemmuu biyya kee geessu) is often not consumed or used for sustenance, but rather for offerings. The passage states that traditional gumrukii (a type of traditional food or offering) can become a source of hardship (girdirsaa ta’uu danda’a). 

Therefore, the non-traditional service being offered is **to’annaa gumurukii (gumrukii offerings)**. It implies a shift in resource use due to the crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sakatta’iinsa godaansaa (Agricultural support):** While potentially helpful, it's not specifically a non-traditional service related to the crisis and the changing role of traditional food.
*   **B: Meeshaalee galmeessisuu (Collection of materials):** This is too general and doesn't specifically address the shift in resource use implied by the passage.
*   **C: Daangaa seeraa meeshaalee (Ceremonial items):**  This is related to traditional ceremonies, but the passage focuses on the changing *use* of traditional food due to the crisis, not just the ceremonial aspects.



"
kanneen armaan gadii keessaa yeroo biyya keetti deebitu maal beekuu qabda?,"The correct answer is **C: to’annaan gumurikii jiraachuu akka danda’u**.

Here's why:

The question asks what you need to know when returning to your homeland after a long time, given the initial statement about the contrast between the pleasant landscape and the unpleasant smell of the city. The initial statement emphasizes the sensory experience of returning.

* **Option C** directly addresses the unpleasant sensory experience mentioned: ""to’annaan gumurikii jiraachuu akka danda’u"" translates to ""that the smell of garbage can exist."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's point that despite the beauty of the landscape, the city's smell can be offensive.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Option A:** ""Bakki sakatta’iinsa godaantotaa akka jiraachuu danda’u"" (That the location can be a place of tourists) - While true, this isn't the primary focus of the passage's contrasting sensory experience.
* **Option B:** ""Meeshaa eyyemameen olitti yoo qabaatte galmeessisuu akka qabdu"" (That you can make a message to be conveyed by the way you dress) - This is about social communication and not the immediate sensory impact of returning.
* **Option D:** ""Meeshaa ati fidaa jirtu keessaa kan hin eeyyamamne akka jiru"" (That there is something unsuitable in the message you are choosing) - This is too abstract and unrelated to the concrete sensory detail of the smell.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, maaltu yoo baay’ate gaara-yaabdotaaf karaa haaraa sulula Kochamo baruuf gargaara?","The correct answer is **C: Fiixee gaaraa (Granite Rocks)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sululaa Kochamo – Bakka ga’umsa pirimiyeerii Chiili, akka Yosemayitii Kibbaa Ameerikaati beekamu, girgidoota giraanayitii gurguddoo fi giragii adda waliin."" This translates to ""Sululaa Kochamo – a place of the meeting of pyramids in Chile, known like Yosemite in the American West, with rounded granite boulders and unique rock formations.""

The text emphasizes the presence of **granite rocks** as a key feature of the region.  This suggests the granite formations are a prominent aspect of the landscape and likely a defining characteristic that helps people identify and navigate the area. The other options don't have the same emphasis in the text.



Therefore, the passage implies the **granite rocks (fiixee gaaraa)** are what make the Sululaa Kochamo area unique and perhaps a landmark for travelers using the Haaraa Road.



"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessaa irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kamtu karaawwan baay’ee Heemisfeera kibbaa uwwisa?","The correct answer is **D: LATAM Waanwoorlidii**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Istaar Aaliyaansiin baha Paasifikii Kibbaa, Saantiyaagoo de Chiilii irraa hanga Tahiitii, isa kan balali’a Waanwoorlidi LATAM ta’e irraa kan hafe waan hunda waliin ga’a."" This means LATAM Waanwoorlidii is the organization that encompasses the most of the Southern Hemisphere. The passage also says that the other organizations (SkyTeam and Star Alliance) do not have a comprehensive presence in the Southern Hemisphere, with SkyTeam specifically having no members among the mentioned airlines in the Southern Hemisphere.
"
Gamtaawwan xiyyaaraa kanneen keessaa karaawwan garba Heemisfeera Kaabaa muraasa uwwisa?,"The correct answer is **C: LATAM Waanwoorlidii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Istaar Aaliyaansiin baha Paasifikii Kibbaa, Saantiyaagoo de Chiilii irraa hanga Tahiitii, isa kan balali’a Waanwoorlidi LATAM ta’e irraa kan hafe waan hunda waliin ga’a.""  This translates to: ""The Star Alliance, from the Pacific region, from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is the one that flies, is LATAM World that connects everything.""

Therefore, LATAM World is explicitly mentioned as a major airline connecting the Southern Hemisphere.
"
Dhaabbata daawwachiisaa kamtu Daawwannaa Fiigichaa Adunyaa fiixaan baase?,"The correct answer is **B: Goo Raaniingi Tuursii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Goo Raaningi Tuursiin neetworkii darzaanan kan fuulen figaan kan ardii afur keessatti deemu.""  This translates to ""The Global Ranking Tourism Network has been fully calculated, covering four continents.""

The question asks which entity the World Tourism Rankings has been based on. The text directly identifies the Global Ranking Tourism Network as the basis.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fiigicha Kopenhagen (Copenhagen flight):** While flights to Copenhagen are part of the data, the network itself is broader.
* **C: Imala fiiguu Pargiwuu (Parked flight data):** This is a specific type of data within the broader tourism network.
* **D: Imala fiiguu Baarseloonaa (Barcelona flight data):**  Similar to C, this is a specific data point, not the overarching entity.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Goo Raaniing Tuursiin Dhaabbatoota bakka fiigicha daawwannaa meeqa walitti qabsiisa?","The correct answer is **A: Afur**.

The passage states: ""Goo Raaningi Tuursiin neetworkii darzaanan kan fuulen figaan kan ardii afur keessatti deemu."" which translates to ""Goo Raaningi Tuursiin network, having completed a full tour of four continents.""
"
Daawwattoonni Ilaalcha qulqullaa’aa Chitaa yoo barbaadan maal gochuu qabu?,"The correct answer is **A: Deemsa daggalaa deemuu (Safari)**.

The passage states: ""Safaariin deemu (kan “deemsa daggalaa”, “safaarii karaa dheeraa deemu”, yookiin deemuu “miillaaniis” jedhamu) dabalataan tabba yaabuu kan qabu, sa’aa muraas ykn guyyaa baayee kan ta’u"" which translates to ""A safari (which is called ""safari"", ""long journey safari"", or ""millennial"") is more than just a short trip, lasting several hours or days.""

The question asks what tourists should do to see the beautiful cheetahs. The passage then mentions that a safari is necessary to see cheetahs and other animals like lions, elephants, and giraffes. Therefore, a safari is the correct answer.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, daawwattoonni yeroo konkolaataadhaan bakka bineensonni jiraatan deeman, bineensa kam arguu danda’u?","The correct answer is **D: Cheetawwan**.

The text states: ""Leencotaa, Cheetawwan fi qeerransi yeroo tokko tokkoo ni qaana’uu fi kan isin caalati isaan arguu dandeessan binokularsiidhani."" which translates to ""Zebras, Cheetahs, and wild dogs sometimes hunt, and you can see them with binoculars.""

While the text mentions zebras, wild dogs, and the possibility of seeing cheetahs, it specifically highlights cheetahs as an animal tourists can see during a safari.
"
"Akka kutichaatti, Baasii daawwannaa maaltu gadi buusuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **C: Nama biraa tokkoo wajjin deemuu** (Going with just one other person).

Here's why:

The text states: ""kanaafu yoo kophaa taate ykn hiriyaa tokko qofa wajjiin taate, namoota biroo waliin qunnamu yaaliitii gatii dhuunfaa wayya’aaf garee afurii hanga ja’a uumi.""  This translates to: ""If you go alone or with just one other person, you create a group of four for the value of the special price.""

Therefore, going with *one other person* fulfills the condition for the special price.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, eenyutu kaffaltii daawwanna hundarra gaarii isaa argachuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **D: Gartuu nama shanii (A group of four people)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Imalli garee guddaaf rakasa dha, kanaafu yoo kophaa taate ykn hiriyaa tokko qofa wajjiin taate, namoota biroo waliin qunnamu yaaliitii gatii dhuunfaa wayya’aaf garee afurii hanga ja’a uumi."" This translates to: ""A large group is a problem. If you travel alone or with only one person, you create a personal security risk. To create a large group for value, form a group of four people.""

Therefore, to ensure safety and receive the benefits described, a group of four people is recommended.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Beekamtii San Firaansiiskoo addunyaaf gahee taphate?","The correct answer is **A: Argama Miidiyaa fii Aartii garaagaraa (Visual Media and Renowned Art)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Muuziqaa, fiilmiiwwan, og-barruu fi aadaa bal’inaan beekaman keessatti irra-deddeebiin of mul’isuun isii magaalattiinii fi bakkeewwan bebbeekamoon isii keessaa akka guutummaa addunyaatti beekamaniif gargaaree jira."" This translates to: ""Her (San Francisco's) prominence in music, films, literature, and art has contributed to her being a well-known city and a globally recognized destination.""

While the other options are true about San Francisco, the passage directly links its global recognition to its visual media and renowned art scene.  The passage mentions the city's strong presence in film and music, directly pointing to ""Argama Miidiyaa fii Aartii garaagaraa"".



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Hima armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee San Firaansiskoo dhugaa kan hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **A: Fiilmiiwwanii fi Og-barruu keessatti yeroo baay’ee caqasameera (It is heavily featured in films and literature).**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Muuziqaa, fiilmiiwwan, og-barruu fi aadaa bal’inaan beekaman keessatti irra-deddeebiin of mul’isuun isii magaalattiinii fi bakkeewwan bebbeekamoon isii keessaa akka guutummaa addunyaatti beekamaniif gargaaree jira."" (Its prominence in music, films, literature, and culture has contributed to its recognition as a global city and its popular destinations.)

While the other options are *true* about San Francisco, the text *doesn't emphasize* them as a defining characteristic in the same way it emphasizes its presence in films and literature.  The phrase ""yeroo baay’ee caqasameera"" (heavily featured) highlights the significant role films and literature play in San Francisco's global image, more so than just the presence of hotels, Asian cuisine, or its financial industry.



Therefore, option A is the best answer because it directly reflects a prominent point made in the text about San Francisco's global image.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Dhaabbilee imalaaitti fayyadamuudhaan imaltoota warra kamtu bu’aa hin buufatu?","The correct answer is **C: Imaltoota Viizaa isaanii hamma yoonaatti hin qulqulleeffanne (Importers whose visas are not fully fulfilled).**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Waa’ee affeerrichaa yaaduuf ykn bakka ga’umsakeef dookumentoota biroo(fkn. Viizaa) bituuf yeroo yoo barbaadde, isaan iddoo siif qabanii turuus ni danda’u.""  This means importers *need* valid documents, including visas, to access the benefits offered by travel agencies.  If their visas aren't in order, they won't be able to utilize the services.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imaltoota murtoo murteessuu hin dandeenye (Importers who cannot produce evidence).** The text describes how agencies can provide documents to prove things, so this isn't a barrier to using the services.
*   **B: Imaltoota akka feetee ta’uun dhiibbaa irratti taasisu (Importers who cause disturbances as guests).** The text doesn't mention any issues related to importers causing disturbances.
*   **D: Imaltoota tajaajila kuufamaa filatan (Importers who choose package services).** The text implies that all importers can benefit, regardless of whether they choose package services or not.



"
kanneen armaan gadi keessaa akka faayidaa dhaabbilee imalaatti kan hin eeramne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Dookumentii imalaa saffisaa (Swift immigration documents)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Waa’ee affeerrichaa yaaduuf ykn bakka ga’umsakeef dookumentoota biroo(fkn. Viizaa) bituuf yeroo yoo barbaadde, isaan iddoo siif qabanii turuus ni danda’u."" (If you need documents for applying for a visa or other purposes, they can even help you obtain them.)  This implies they offer a fast way to get immigration documents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Waliigaltee Hoteelaa (Hotel partnership)** - This is mentioned as hotels partnering with travel agencies, not a benefit *of* travel agencies themselves.
*   **C: Tajaajila kuuffamaa hunda haammatu (Handling all accommodation services)** - While travel agencies handle accommodation, it's a service *they provide* to travelers, not a benefit travel agencies *receive* from it.
*   **D: Dursa qabachuu (Having a travel agent)** - This is the core function of a travel agent; it's not a benefit *of* them, but rather what they *offer*.

"Akka kutichaatti, Appilikeeshinoota tajaajila afaan hiikuu kan yeroo-dhugaa kennanii maal gochuu hin danda’an?","The correct answer is **D: yeroo hundumaa 100% sirriitti hiikuu** (Translate accurately 100% of the time).

Here's why:

The text states that while these apps are very useful and can translate text and images, they can sometimes be inaccurate. Option D directly reflects this limitation. The text mentions that accuracy can be affected by various factors, including the complexity of the language and the context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mallattoolee afaan biyya biroo hiikuu** (Translate foreign language symbols): The text explicitly says they can translate foreign language symbols.
* **B: Guutummaa barreeffamaa hiikuu** (Translate entire texts): The text states they *can* translate entire texts.
* **C: Bilbila Ismaartiidhaan barreeffama wantoota irra jiru hiikuu** (Translate text from images using a smartphone camera): The text mentions this capability.



"
Afaan hiikuun toora intarneetaa malee akka danda’amu maaltu eeyyama?,"The correct answer is **D: Appilikeeshinoota barreema hiikan kan yeroo-dhugaa keessatti ramadaman (Real-time text recognition apps)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Appilikeeshinootni garee kanaa baay’een barreeffamoota afaanota biyya alaa kan mallatoodhaan ykn wantoota birooaddunyaa dhugaa keessa jiran hiikuu danda’u..."" (Apps in this category can accurately recognize text in real-time, whether it's from images or other global sources...)
* It also mentions Google Translate as an example, which is a real-time text recognition app that can translate text even without internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Meeshotni afaan hiikuu fooyya’oo (New text recognition software):** While relevant, the passage focuses on *apps*, not just general software.
* **B: Bilbila Ismaartii (Smart phone):** A smartphone is a device, but it's the *apps* on the smartphone that perform the text recognition.
* **C: Oddeeffannoo afaanii buusachuu (Voice input):** This refers to speech-to-text, not text recognition from written text.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa bugugii cabbiif kakaasaa kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Ifa Aduu**.

Here's why:

The text states that the cabbage's problem is that its leaves are intertwined, preventing it from growing properly. It then mentions the following things that *cause* the cabbage to grow (or not grow):

*   **Cabbii walharkisuuf (Intertwined leaves):** This is the core problem.
*   **Namoota (People):** The text implies people are involved in the process, as they are making the cabbage grow.
*   **Rooba cabbii dabalataa (Extra cabbage leaves):** While excessive leaves can be a symptom, the text doesn't directly say they *cause* growth. It says extra leaves happen *sometimes* alongside other things.

**Ifa Aduu (Sunlight)** is not mentioned as a cause of the cabbage growing or not growing in the text.
"
"Akka kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa akka bugugii cabbiitti kan dhufu kami dha?","The correct answer is **A: Cabbii wal qabataa hin dhiibamne (Cabbage that is not properly tied/bound)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the problem with cabbages that fall over is due to their stems not being properly tied/bound together. This prevents them from staying upright and causes them to fall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Irraan gadee cimaa cabbii hin qabne (A strong stem that the cabbage doesn't have):** The text doesn't mention a lack of a strong stem as the problem.
*   **C: Cabbii baay’ee irraan gadee cimaa irraa (A lot of stem from the cabbage):**  The text doesn't say having a lot of stem is an issue.
*   **D: Cabbii namaan itti hin bu’amiin hafan (Cabbage that doesn't have a human connection):** This is a metaphorical and nonsensical option based on the text's practical description.

Therefore, option A directly addresses the core issue explained in the text."
"Akka kutichaatti, Kaariin mi’a dheedhii kamiin qophaa’a?","The correct answer is **B: Baalaa fi mi’eessituu**.

The text states: ""Kaariin nyaata biqiltuu baala qofaafi mi’eessituuwwan irratti hundaa’e..."" which translates to ""The carpet is based only on wool and cotton...""

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
"Naannoowwan murtaa’an keessatti, aannan kokonaatii bakka mi’a dheedhii kamii Kaarii keessatti fayyadamamuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **C: Itittuu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gara gidduu naannoo Kaaba Hindii fi Pakistanitti, itittuun mi'eessituu keessatti baratamaan fayyada; gara Kibbai Hindiifi naannolee qarqara bishaanii biro qaama ardichaatti i , aannan kokonatii baay'inaan fayyadamu.""

This translates to: ""In the middle region of the Indian subcontinent, itittuun mi'eessituu (straw/hay) is used in conjunction with fodder; in the region of the Indian peninsula, the water of the river is used with a large amount of coconut.""

The passage explicitly links ""itittuun"" (straw/hay) to being used with fodder, and also mentions the use of coconut water.  The other options (foon - fodder, muduraa - management, mi'ooftuu -  (likely) a type of food/plant) are not directly linked to the amount of something used in the kaari (cart/wagon) in the passage.  ""Itittuu"" is the only one specifically mentioned in the context of something being used *in* the cart.



"
Bakkee olka’aa diriiraa bira ga’uuf gaara Tiraansantaarkitikaa irra marsuun maaliif barbaachise?,"The correct answer is **B: Cabbiin walitti qabate balaafamaa waan ta’eef**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cabbii walitti galedha kan baqaqaa bal’aan isaa alaabaadhaan guutamee mallattoo ittiin godhame."" This translates to: ""The remaining cargo was bundled with ropes and marked.""  This indicates the cargo was damaged, likely due to the conditions of the journey.  Therefore, the reason for choosing the Transantarctic route was because the remaining cargo was damaged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Buufatni Maakmuurdao yeroo baay’ee waan cufamuuf** (Because the Mawkuurdao winds are often strong): While strong winds are a factor in the journey, the passage doesn't explicitly state this as the *reason* for choosing the Transantarctic route.
* **C: Konkolaattonni addaa waan ariifatoo hin taaneef** (The modern ships were not suitable): The passage mentions using tractors and other vehicles to pull the cargo, implying ships were used at some point. It doesn't indicate modern ships were unsuitable.
* **D: Karaa galaana Roozii imaluu caalaa salphaa dha** (It is safer than the Rozi passage): The passage doesn't compare the safety of the Transantarctic route to the Rozi passage.



"
"Karaa kallattii Kaabaatiin, maaltu alaabaadhaan milikkiteeffame?","The correct answer is **C: Lafa baqaqaa cabiidhaan guutame** (The remaining soil, compacted by the bulldozer).

The text clearly states: ""Cabbii walitti galedha kan baqaqaa bal’aan isaa alaabaadhaan guutamee mallattoo ittiin godhame"" which translates to ""The remaining soil, compacted by the bulldozer, was marked.""
"
"Kuticha keessatti, daawwattoonnii yeroo Afriikaa Kibbaa habuuranitti wanta isaan beekuu qabu jedhamee hin eeramne kami?","The correct answer is **A: Biyyoonni baay’een ulaagaa viizaa garaagaraa qabu**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ulaagaan Viizaadhaf barbaachisu biyyaa biyyatti adda addadha, akkasumas biyya ati irraa dhufte irratti kan hunda’uu dha.""  This translates to ""The visa requirement differs from country to country, as well as depending on the country you are coming from."" This highlights the varied visa requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iddoo qofaatti adda ba’e habuuruuf konkolaataadhaan deemuun karaaa gaarii dha** - The passage discusses the challenges of traveling in Southern Africa, including the need for 4x4 vehicles, but doesn't say that driving is the *easy* way.
* **C: Guutummaa guutuutti hamma jechuun danda’amutti biyyoonni ollee Afriika Kibbaatasgabbaa’oo dha** - The passage indicates that some Southern African countries are not necessarily underdeveloped, but it doesn't claim *all* of them are.
* **D: konkolaataadhaan imaluuf yoo ta’e, 4x4tu gorfama** - While the passage mentions 4x4s are often needed, it doesn't state that *all* vehicles must be 4x4s.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, Daawwattoota Afriikaa Kibbaa konkolaataadhaan habuuruuf yaadaniif akka gorsa gadheetti kan ilaalamu kami?","The correct answer is **D: Biyyoonni ollaa Afriikaa Kibbaa hundumtuu daawwannaaf ni mijatu jechuun hin danda’amu.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...Sammuuti qabadhu yeroo sana karoorsitu akka Afriikan kibba tasgabooftuu hin taane biyyootni ollaa biroon illee hin miti."" This translates to ""...It's a shame that the planning for that time doesn't encompass all the large countries of Southern Africa.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Meeshaaleen balaa dingataa muraasni seeraan irraa barbaadamuu danda’u:** While some safety equipment might be legally required, the text focuses on the larger logistical challenges, not just safety equipment.
* **B: 4x4n kan gorfamu utuu ta’ee jiruu, naannooleen tokko tokko konkolaattota kaaniif ni danda’ama:** The text highlights that 4x4s are commonly used, but doesn't say they are *always* necessary or acceptable for all types of vehicles.  It emphasizes the complexity of regulations.
* **C: Namoota karaa beekame irraan ala ta’e barbaadaniif, konkolaataadhaan imaluun gaarii dha:** The text doesn't make a blanket statement that driving is a good option for tourists. It points out the regulations and potential difficulties.

Therefore, option D accurately reflects the main point of the text - that not all countries in Southern Africa are equally welcoming or easily accessible for tourists and that there are significant logistical and regulatory considerations.



"
"kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kuticha keessatti, akka balaa boorsaa ofii qalbeeffachuu dhiisuuttii kan hin eeramne kami?","The correct answer is **B: Utuu hin beekamiin baataa Qorichoota sammuu nama hadoochanii ta’uu dandeessa.**

Here's why:

The passage states that knowledge, without wisdom, can lead to problems. It also mentions that people can use knowledge to harm others, even unintentionally. Option B directly reflects this idea: possessing knowledge without understanding its implications or the potential harm it can cause (like a blind person holding a sharp object) can be dangerous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hatamuu danda’u (Being able to avoid):** The passage doesn't focus on avoiding something, but rather on the consequences of having knowledge without wisdom.
* **C: Kan nama biraa wajjin wal wallaalchisuu danda’a (Being able to cooperate with others):** While cooperation can be good, the passage is highlighting the negative consequences of unchecked knowledge, not necessarily how it impacts relationships.
* **D: Abbootiin taayitaa akka meeshaa dhuka’uu ta’uu danda’utti ilaaluu malu (Should not look at the father of the witness as a sacrificial offering):** This option is unrelated to the central theme of the passage, which is about the dangers of knowledge without wisdom.



"
Waa’ee qoricha sammuu nama hadoochanii kamtu kuticha keessatti hin eeramne?,"The correct answer is **B: Yeroo imala addunyaawaa taasisan ofeeggannoo dabalataa taasisuun dirqama**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Biyyoonni muraasni adaba cimaa hamma barbaadamuu ol adabu, balleessaa jalqaabaaf ta'ullee; fakkeenyaaf hidhaa cimaa waggaa 10 olii fi adaba du'aa ta'uu danda'a.

This translates to: ""...Some countries will take the highest punishment for everything they want, to destroy people; for example, a serious hidaa for over 10 years and a du'aa punishment can happen.  Korojoowwan hin dhihaatin hannaaf saaxilamanii abbootii taayitaa jalaa xiyyeeffannoo soda dhookuu hawwatan. **A supplementary commitment is made by the establishment of the world era, and dirqama (punishment) is inflicted.**""

Therefore, option B accurately reflects a point made in the text regarding how some countries respond to serious offenses.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Namoonni yeroo jalqabaaf harkatti qabame adabbii du’aadhaan adabamuu danda’u (People who are caught for the first time can be punished with du'aa)** - While du'aa punishment is mentioned, the text doesn't say it's *only* for first-time offenders.

*   **C: Saroonni qoricha fuunfatan hubachiisuu malee fayyadamamuu danda’u (The punishments that are given can be used without clarifying the reasons.)** - The text highlights the severity of some punishments and implies that reasons *are* considered.

*   **D: Abbootiin taayitaa toa'annaa jala si oolchuu danda'a (The father of the family can be punished.)** - The text refers to the father of the family, but it does not state that they *can* be punished. It says they are under investigation.

Gosa dhugaatii kamtu yeroo boqonnaa mana ofiittii akka yaalaniif hin eeramne?,"The answer is **A: Cuunfaa (Tea)**.

The text specifically states: ""Ayyaana dabarsitu, yeroo sirritti of kunuunsu ni argata akkasumaas waan adda tokko hojjechuuf daqiiqa muraasa dabalatan fudhata. Yoo akka jabduu sitti dhagahamaa jiraate, **carraa cuunfaa yookaan waan adda addaa walitti makuu qabaadhu.**""

This translates to: ""When you are busy, you can be seen taking a break and also taking a few extra minutes to do something else. If you are feeling stressed, you can **have a cup of tea or something else to relax**.""

The question asks which type of tea is mentioned for relaxing. Therefore, the correct answer is tea (cuunfaa).

"Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa yeroo boqonnaa biyya keettii, yoo magaalaan kee aadaa dhugaatii isaaf beekama ta’e maal daawwachuu qabda?","The correct answer is **A: Suuqii bunaa ollaa keerraa fagoo (Traditional coffee market)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of coffee in Ethiopian culture.** It describes how coffee is a central part of daily life, social gatherings, and even rituals.
* **The question asks about a place to experience the local coffee culture.** A traditional coffee market (""Suuqii bunaa ollaa keerraa fagoo"") is the most direct and authentic place to observe and participate in this culture.  You'll see coffee being roasted, ground, brewed, and served in a traditional manner.
* **The other options are less relevant:**
    * **B: Cuunfaa yookiin suuqii cuunfaa kireemii (Butter or cream market):** While butter and cream might be used in some coffee preparations, the market itself isn't central to the coffee *culture*.
    * **C: Pabii yeroo hedduu hin deemne (Rarely visited pub):** A pub is not a typical place to experience traditional Ethiopian coffee culture.
    * **D: Mana nyaataa shaayii baay’ee mi’aawaa qopheessan (Tea houses with many assembled people):**  While tea houses exist, the passage strongly focuses on *coffee*.



"
Siidaan gugee eessatti argama?,"The correct answer is **A: Sa’aatii walakkaa badiyyicha irraa (From the Gandhi Baadiyya's prayer time)**.

The passage states: ""Naannoo walakkaa sa’atii namatti fudhata"" which translates to ""The prayer time allows access to the area."" Therefore, the seeds are likely collected *during* the prayer time at the Gandhi Baadiyya. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Viisaa gosa kamtu namni tokko qarshii gahaa qabaachuu isaa ragaa akka dhiheessuuf gaafata?,"The correct answer is **A: Viisaa daldalaa (Student Visa)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Biyyoota harka caalaniif, dhaabbata itti barachuu barbaadde irraa xalayaa afeerraa kan si barbaachisuu fi kana malees ragaa deeggarsa maallaqaa kan yoo xiqqaateef wagga jalqabaa koorsii keetiitiif ittiin of deeggartu si barbaachisa. **Dhaabbaticharraa adda baafadhu, akkasumas ulaagaalee gadi-fagoodhaaf kutaa immigireeshinii biyya keessatti barachuu barbbaadduu gaafadhu.**""

This section refers to student visas.  Student visas require proof of financial resources to cover tuition and living expenses.  The other visa types (tourist, short-term, etc.) don't typically require the same level of financial documentation to apply.
"
Eenyutu viisaan yeroo dheeraaf isa barbaachisuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **C: Barataa Idil-addunyaa (International Student)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Akka daawwataa tokkootti deemu irra akka barataa addunyaalessaatti deemuun walumaa galatti turtii dheeraa barbaada."" This translates to: ""To go as a tourist or to go as an international student requires extensive information.""  Therefore, international students are among those who need a visa for a longer period.
"
Yeroo kam waa’ee bookee addatti qalbeeffachuu qabda?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeroo Bonaa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bona keessa, keessattuu, yoo bosona keessa miilla diriifachuuf murteessite bookee irraa of eeggachuu si barbaachisa."" This translates to ""In Bona, especially if you're worried about getting a book out of the forest, it's good to take care of it.""

The question asks when you should be particularly mindful of the book. The text links this mindfulness to being in Bona.

"Akka kutichaatti, yeroo bosona roobaa keessa konkolaataa ooftu, buukee ittisuudhaaf maal gochuu irraa of qusachuu qabda?","The correct answer is **D: Yeroo deemsa miillaanii, konkolaataaf xiyyeeffannoo kennuu dhiisuu.**

Here's why:

The question asks what you should *avoid* doing if you're in the tropics and experiencing a power outage while trying to read.  Option D directly addresses that:

* **Yeroo deemsa miillaanii, konkolaataaf xiyyeeffannoo kennuu dhiisuu:** This translates to ""During the power outage, stop focusing on the reading.""  This is the logical thing to do when a power outage occurs while trying to read – you need to prioritize dealing with the power issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Balbala konkolaataa yeroo dheeraaf bananii tursuu:**  ""Using a battery-powered lamp for a long time"" is a *solution* to the power outage, not something to avoid.
* **B: Yeroo bonaa keessa oofuu:** ""Staying indoors during the day"" is irrelevant to the power outage problem.
* **C: Naannoo cita tirooppikii ta’an keessa oofuu:** ""Staying in a tropical region"" is a description of the location, not a course of action to avoid during a power outage.

"Akka kutichaatti, Himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee Sandaarbaanii dhugaa kan hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **D: Qeerrensa Beengaali caalaa bakka argama Bosonuu tuqaa qabuuti** (Royal Bengal tigers are found in greater numbers than mangroves).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""1966 irraa eegalee Sandarbaansonni bakka jireenyaa bineensotaa turani, fi amma qeerransoota Rooyaal Beengaalii 400’tu jira jedhamee shakkama, kurupheewwan ammoo 30,000’tu naannochatti argame."" (Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a habitat for animals, and now it is estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers, while 30,000 spotted deer are found in the region.)
* **This clearly indicates:** There are significantly more spotted deer than Royal Bengal tigers in the Sundarbans.
* **Option D is therefore false.**

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

* **A: Bosonoota dandamachuu danda’an muraasa jran bakka bu’a** (It is a place where various species can be found): The text mentions a wide variety of animals, including Royal Bengal tigers, spotted deer, and spotted cranes.
* **B: Walakkaan iddoo isaa lafa caffeedhaan kan uwwifame dha** (It is primarily a mangrove forest): The text explicitly states, ""Bakka argama mangiroov guddicha addunyaa kanaati"" (It is the home of the world's largest mangrove forest).
* **C: Bakka argama mangiroov guddicha addunyaa kanaati** (It is the home of the world's largest mangrove forest): This is directly stated in the text.



"
Kutaa bosonichaa kamtu daangaa Hindii keessa oola?,"The correct answer is **A: Paarkii biyyoolessaa Sandaarbaan (Sundarban National Park)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Gariin bosona isaa daangaa Indiyaa keessa oolu Paarkii Biyyaalessaa Sandarbaansi jedhama."" which translates to ""Its core is located in the Indian state of Sundarban National Park.""
"
"Akka kutichaatti, Eenyutu yoo xinnaate hubannoo afaan Ingilizii daanga’aa ta’ee qabaachuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **B: Namoota umurii gara ijoollee (Young people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that young people are more likely to be fluent in English and are able to access more information from educated people. The example of people from various countries living in Toronto and using their local languages and dialects while also communicating in English highlights this point.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Nama yoo xiqqaate afaa biroo lama haasa’u (If someone speaks another language, they must speak two languages):** The passage doesn't imply this. It focuses on English fluency, not necessarily bilingualism.
*   **C: Namoota gara Torontootti imalan (People who came to Toronto):** While many immigrants learn English, the passage emphasizes the linguistic advantage of *young* people.
*   **D: Namoota ga’eessa (Educated people):** The passage mentions educated people but doesn't state that only educated people are fluent in English. The focus is on age.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, Sagaleessuuf kamtu cimuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **A: Jechoota loqoda adda biraa keessa jiran (Words from other languages)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that when people speak in a mixed language environment, they often use words from other languages to fill in gaps in their vocabulary or to express themselves more effectively. This is presented as a way to overcome the challenge of limited vocabulary and communicate effectively. The example of people from different backgrounds in Toronto using their native words and local dialects to connect highlights this point.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Teessoo (Soil)** - This is irrelevant to language learning and communication.
* **C: Jechoota barreeffaman (Written words)** - While written words are important, the text focuses on *spoken* language and how it's used in a mixed language environment.
* **D: Haasaa malaa naannoo (Non-local dialect)** -  The text doesn't suggest that using a non-local dialect is a primary way to become proficient in speaking. It's about using words from *other languages* altogether.

"Akka kutichaatti, imalaa baasii buufata qaxxaamuraa qabachu karoorsuuff haala kamtu filatamaa dha?","The correct answer is **A: Imalaa gara Jaakar deemuu fi tikeetee dursee kan bitate.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""addaatti kan gara bahatti imalani fi Jaakar/Bamtaangi deeman sa’aa 06:30 fi 07:30 ti dha."" (The ones going to Jaakar/Bamtaangi leave at 6:30 and 7:30.)
* It also says: ""Awutoobusiin qaxxaamuraa waan yeroo hundaa guutaniif guyyaa muraasa dursanii tikeeta murachuun ni gorfama."" (Tickets for the commuter bus are purchased a few days in advance.)

Therefore, to go to Jaakar or Bamtaangi, you need to leave at 6:30 or 7:30 and buy your ticket in advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imalaa gara Bamtaangi deemuu fi sa’atii 7tti ba’uu qabu** - While Bamtaangi is a destination, the text doesn't say you *must* leave at 7:00.  It offers a 7:30 option.
* **C: Imalaa Paaroo deemuu fi sa’atii 11 booda ba’uu qabu** - The text mentions Paaroo (Lakk 150) but doesn't associate it with leaving at 11:00 AM.
* **D: Imalaa gara bahaa deemuu fi sa’atii 6:20 dura buufaticha qaqqabe** -  ""Gara bahaa"" is not mentioned as a destination. And while buying tickets in advance is good, the specific time of 6:20 AM isn't supported by the text.



"
Daawwataa buufata baasii qaxxaamuraa gara bahaatti imaluuf odeeffannoon gaarii ta’e kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Tikeetii dursanii bitachuu (Buying tickets in advance)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Awutoobusiin qaxxaamuraa waan yeroo hundaa guutaniif guyyaa muraasa dursanii tikeeta murachuun ni gorfama."" This translates to ""To travel by bus, it is recommended to buy tickets in advance a few days before.""
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa ibsa Timbuuktuu sirrii kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Xiyyaaraan deemuun hin danda’amu (Cannot be reached by air)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inni bakka dhaabi jiraan keessa isaa tokko yeroo Henerii luwiis Geetsi' PBS waan bareedaa Afriika addunyaaf ibsee. Magaalichii magaaloota biro biyyicha keessa jiraan waliin bifa wal faallessuun jabaadha, sababnisaas inni baay’inaan kan Araabota qaba kan Afriikanoota caalaa."" This translates to: ""In one of its locations, Henerii luwiis Geetsi' PBS once described Africa to the world. The city has a strong connection with other cities within the country, mainly because it has a large Arab population compared to Africans.""

The passage **doesn't** say Timbuktu can't be reached by air. In fact, the first sentence mentions that it's a ""magaala deegduudha"" (great city), implying accessibility.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Biyyoota biraa caalaa dhiibbaa Arabaa qaba (Has a larger Arab population than other countries):** The passage explicitly states this.
* **B: Hiyyummaa hamaadhaan kan miidhamte (Was damaged by a severe drought):** The passage mentions a drought (""hiyyummaa hamaadhaan""), indicating damage, but doesn't make it an incorrect statement.
* **D: Daawwattoota beekuuf hedduu barbaadaniif bakka hawwataa dha (Is a popular place for tourists who are seeking):** The passage explicitly mentions that it's a ""bakka hawwataa dha"" (tourist destination).



Therefore, the only statement that is **not** supported by the passage is that Timbuktu cannot be reached by air.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee Timbuuktuu kamtu dhugaa dha?,"The correct answer is **C: Magaalota naannoo gaditti Aadaa Afrikaanummaa qabu (It is a city that has strong African identity in the Sahel region)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Magaalichii magaaloota biro biyyicha keessa jiraan waliin bifa wal faallessuun jabaadha, sababnisaas inni baay’inaan kan Araabota qaba kan Afriikanoota caalaa."" (The city has strong ties with other cities within the country, because it has a large Arab population compared to Africans.)
* While the city is known for tourism (mentioned in the text), option A isn't a direct statement from the text.
* Option B is a general statement about what attracts people and isn't specifically about Timbuktu.
* Option D is incorrect because the text explicitly mentions that Timbuktu attracts tourists.

Option C correctly reflects the blend of cultures in Timbuktu, particularly the strong African identity despite the significant Arab influence. The Sahel region is in North Africa, and the text highlights the city's connections within the region. Therefore, it has a strong African identity within the broader context of the Sahel.
"
Olompiikiin gannaa yoomitti sagantaan isaa qabame? ,"The correct answer is **B: Gurraandhala 2020**.

The text states: ""Yoo balalii fi iddoo turtii 2020f tikkeettii kutatte osoo dabarsuun hin beeksifamiin, siin haalli hin yaadamnee si mudaachu danda’aa."" This translates to ""If you apply and get tickets for the venue and date 2020, you may not be able to get them even if you apply without being informed.""  This clearly refers to the Summer Olympics of 2020, which were held in 2021 due to the pandemic.

"Akka kutichaatti, yeroo kam obomboleettiin gara Toorneedootti jijjiirama?","The correct answer is **A: Yeroo bubbeen saffisa naannoo sa’aatiitti maayelii 100 ga’u**.

The text states: ""Bubbee guddaa gad dhiisu (yeroo hedduu sa’atiitti maayelii 100-200)... yemmuu lafa ga’an “toornaadoowwan” ta’u.""  This translates to ""A large wind descends (for many hours at 100-200 mph)... when the ground reaches..."" indicating that tornadoes form when wind speeds reach 100-200 mph.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yeroo utubaan qilleensaa naanna’uu eegalu** (When the tornado starts to spin): While spinning is part of a tornado, the text doesn't specify that the *starting* of the spin is the trigger. The wind speed is the primary factor.
* **C: Yeroo duumeessa qilleensa bubbee makaterraa bu’uu** (When the ground wind descends in a storm):  The text describes a strong descent of wind, but it doesn't specifically tie it to a ""storm.""  It's more about the sustained high wind speeds.
* **D: Erga lafa tuqee** (Once the ground is reached): The ground being reached is a *result* of the tornado forming, not the *cause* of its formation.



"
Kanneen keessaa kamtu amala Toorneedoo sirrii dha?,"The correct answer is **C: Yeroo lafa tuqan obomboleettii ta’u**.

Here's why:

* The text describes a tornado as starting from a low, dark cloud (obomboleetti) and becoming a tornado when it reaches the ground.  Option C directly reflects this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo hundumaa bubbee saffisa sa’atiitti maayelii 100-200tti kennu:** While strong winds are *involved* in tornado formation, it doesn't mean *all the time*.  This is too broad and doesn't accurately represent the conditions.
* **B: Yeroo baay’ee wantoota ulfaatoo sochoosu:**  While tornadoes can involve debris, the text doesn't say constant debris movement is a defining characteristic.
* **D: Utubaa qilleensa naanna’au kan qilleensa gara bakkeetti dhiibu dha:** This is a misinterpretation.  The text is describing *what a tornado is*, not saying it's related to YouTube or any specific type of debris.

"Akka kutichaatti, daawwattoonni waa’ee tasgabbaa’iinsa siyaasaa biyya deemanii ilaalchisee eessaatii gorsa fudhachuu qabu?","The correct answer is **A: Mootummaa biyya daawwachuuf deemanii irraa** (The government of the country they are visiting).

Here's why:

The passage discusses how governments can offer health insurance to visitors. It mentions that while governments might have the capacity to provide better care than what's available in the host country, they often make it accessible to the public.  The example of US citizens being able to access healthcare in Europe or the Arab world highlights this point.

Therefore, the passage implies that the government of the visiting country is the entity that would likely provide or facilitate health insurance for visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ilaalcha gorsaa imalaatiin dhiyaaterraa** (Medical travel agency):  While medical travel agencies exist, the passage focuses on governmental role.
* **C: Lammiilee biyya daawwachuuf deemanii irraa** (The people who travel to the country): Individuals themselves don't typically *provide* health insurance; they *receive* it.
* **D: Mootummaa mataa isaanii irraa** (The government of their own country): The passage doesn't focus on the traveler's home government. It's about the government of the country they are visiting.



"
"Taatee gorsa imalaa keessatti, lammiin alaa maal muuxannoo godhachuu dhiisuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **C: Inshuraansii fayyaa dhiibbaan irra ga’e (Health insurance has been obtained)**.

Here's why:

* The passage discusses how people can access healthcare in foreign countries. It highlights the importance of health insurance.
* Option C directly addresses this by stating that health insurance has been obtained.  This is the most relevant and direct answer to the question of what a foreign national can do to access healthcare.

Let's look at why the other options are not as suitable:

* **A: Haqamuu inshuraansii dhiibbaan irra ga’e (Travel insurance has been obtained):** While travel insurance *can* cover medical expenses, the passage focuses on *health* insurance more generally.  Travel insurance is a specific type.
* **B: Haala siyaasa biyya sanaa ilaalchisee gudunfama baay’ee salphatee qophaa’e (Having a large, well-established network based on the political situation of that country):** This describes a *characteristic* of some countries' healthcare systems, but it's not something a foreign national *does*.
* **D: Haala siyaasa biyya sanaa ilaalchisee odeeffannoo gadi fagoo (Having preliminary information based on the political situation of that country):**  Having information is helpful, but it doesn't directly enable access to healthcare.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ejensiin imalaa, yeroo baay’ee imala bal’aa kan imalaan muuxannoo umamaa, aadaa, afaan yookiin biyyoota galii xiqqoo irratti kan kanaan dura godhe caalu gochuuf filannoo gaarii dha."" This translates to: ""The agency of statistics, for the most part, chooses it as a good opportunity to evaluate the data it has previously collected on the well-being of the people, culture, language, or small countries.""

This indicates that the agency wants to *continue* work they've already started in those areas. Therefore, the data they need help with is related to previous work in the region. Options B, C, and D don't directly reflect this continuous evaluation of prior work.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, haala kam keessatti imalaan tajaajila ejensootaa irraa caalaatti fayyadamaa ta’a?","The correct answer is **D: Yeroo imalaan gara naannoo garaagarummaa aadaa jiru beekuu daawwaachuu deemu.**

Here's why:

* The text emphasizes that the Estonian National Audiovisual Institute (Eesti Keele- ja Kultuuritelevisioon) is a valuable resource for understanding Estonian culture, traditions, and regional diversity. 
* Option D directly reflects this: watching Estonian audiovisual materials allows you to learn about the unique customs and traditions of different regions within Estonia.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Yeroo imalaan daawwannaa biyya isaa dhaqaa galaaf galmaa’u (Watching the program to feel closer to your homeland):** While watching Estonian programs might evoke a sense of belonging, it's not the primary purpose highlighted in the text. The text focuses on *learning* about Estonia.
* **B: Yeroo imalaan jalqabaaf imala bashannanaa yeroo gabaabaa taasisuuf galmaa’uu fedhu (Watching the program to create a happy gathering at the beginning):** This is a social aspect of watching TV, not directly related to the educational/cultural benefits emphasized.
* **C: Yeroo imalaan afaan biyya daawwachuu deemuu seeraan danda’u (Watching the program to learn the language):** While you might pick up some language, the text doesn't primarily focus on language learning as a key benefit. It focuses on understanding Estonian culture more broadly.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate reflection of how audiovisual materials can be utilized to gain benefits from the Estonian National Audiovisual Institute.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, Imaltoonni iddoo haaraa yeroo daawwatan akka abdii hin kutanne maaltu gargaaruu danda’a?","The correct answer is **A: Iddoo dhufanii wajjin waanta wal fakkaatu eeguu (Bring things similar to the place they've arrived in)**.

Here's why:

The text explains that during an ""imaltu"" (a period of transition or a new environment), things familiar to you (like your home, books, food, etc.) are lost.  This creates a feeling of discomfort and anxiety.  Bringing familiar objects helps to bridge that gap and create a sense of normalcy and security in the new environment.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Nyaatota kanaan dura hin beekne yaaluuf of qopheessuu (Prepare for foods they don't know):** While being prepared for new foods is important, it doesn't directly address the core issue of feeling lost and disconnected from a familiar environment.
* **C: Seerota biyya dhufaniitti cichuu (Attend ceremonies of the country they've arrived in):** Participating in ceremonies can be helpful for cultural integration, but it's not the immediate solution to the feeling of displacement described in the text.
* **D: Odeeffannoo waa’ee bakka buufatanii qorachuu dhiisuu (Stop studying information about the place they've arrived in):** Studying about the new place is *beneficial* for understanding and adapting, the text doesn't suggest stopping.



Therefore, bringing familiar objects (option A) directly addresses the need to combat the feelings of loss and anxiety associated with ""imaltu.""



"
"Oddeeffannoo kuticha keessaa irratti hundaa’uudhaan, Nama akkamiitu yeroo biyya haaraatti imalu mufachuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **B: Nama jijjiirama fudhachuun itti cimu (Someone who is open to change).**

Here's why:

The text describes the significant cultural shifts one experiences when moving to a new place like Ethiopia. It emphasizes that familiar things like ""home"" disappear, and everything from language to food to social customs changes.  The text explicitly states that embracing this change is key to overcoming the feeling of homesickness.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Nama nyaata biyya biroo jaallatu (Someone who loves foreign food):** While enjoying new food is a positive experience, it doesn't address the broader cultural adjustment needed to combat homesickness.
*   **C: Nama waan haaraa baruuf qophii hin taane (Someone who is not prepared to go to a new place):** This is the opposite of what the text suggests.  The text implies preparation is less important than adaptability.
*   **D: Nama waa barachuu jaallatu (Someone who loves to create):**  While creativity is valuable, the text's main point is about adjusting to a new environment, not about creating something new.



Therefore, being open to change (""jijjiirama fudhachuun itti cimu"") is the most direct response to the challenges of adjusting to life in a new cultural context, as described in the text."

The passage explicitly states: ""Yoo bakkeeti mana ijaarate bashananu barbaade, waan uffatu yookiin Hamokii fidadhu kottu kan Bofaa, iskorpiyanii fi wantoota akka Sanaa irra si eegu. **Yoo bakkeeti mana ijaarate bashananu barbaade, waan uffatu yookiin Hamokii fidadhu kottu kan Bofaa, iskorpiyanii fi wantoota akka Sanaa irra si eegu. Naannoo bineensota naannawaa jiraatan hin beeknetti firaashii yooken afata furdaa lallaafaa lafarra afattee hin rafiin.**""  This translates to: ""If you want to stay in a place, you might want a hammock or a cot made of Bofaa, scorpions and things like that. **If you want to stay in a place, you might want a hammock or a cot made of Bofaa, scorpions and things like that. If you don't know the animals of the area, don't sleep on the floor.**""

This directly implies that you should be aware of the local wildlife *before* sleeping on the ground to avoid being bitten or stung.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Guyyaa jalqabaadhaan nyaatatti qarshii humnaan olii baasuu dhiisuu:** The passage doesn't mention anything about paying extra for food.
*   **C: Uffata qorraa fi sireen buufachuuf ni gorfamu:** The passage mentions dealing with scorpions and other creatures, but doesn't specifically say you should be prepared for sunburn or heatstroke.
*   **D: Yeroo jalqabaaf achi geessu hoteela qaaliitti qarshii baasuu:** The passage doesn't imply that you *must* stay in a expensive hotel. It focuses more on safety and awareness of the local environment.

The text explicitly states: ""...hoteelotta babbayessoo, nyaata akkasumas tajaajilaf akka qisaasummaatii ilaali.""  This translates to ""...luxury hotels, food, and treat it as a service.""  The focus is on the *quality of the service*, specifically cleanliness and luxury, which directly relates to ""tajaajila qulqullina qabu"" (clean service).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nyaata istaayila warra lixaa (Lixaa style food):**  While mentioned, it's presented as one of many available options, not the primary focus of investment.
* **C: Boraatii yookiin uffata siree buufachuuf (Air conditioning or a fan):** Mentioned as something lacking in some places, not an investment focus for thriving destinations.
* **D: Hoteela qulqullina qabu (Clean hotel):** While a clean hotel is *part* of the service, the text emphasizes the overall *quality* and *luxury* of the service, not just the cleanliness of the hotel itself.

* **The Problem:** The question states that the individuals have copies of their insurance information but *do not have internet access*. This eliminates options B, C, and D, as they all require internet access to be effective.
* **Why Option A Works:**  If someone *does* have internet access, they can physically receive the copy of the insurance information from the individual who doesn't. This allows them to then upload it to a cloud service, email it, or use it in other ways.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Koppii isaa ofitti iimeeliidhaan erguu (Emailing the copy to oneself):** This is useless since the person doesn't have internet access.
* **C: Koppii isaa Laaptooppii isaanii keessatti kuusachuu (Saving the copy on their laptop):** This is useless since the person doesn't have internet access to upload it to a cloud service.
* **D: Koppii isaa “Kilawodii” keessattii kuusachuu (Saving the copy on a ""Kilawodi""):**  ""Kilawodi"" is unclear. If it refers to a local storage device without internet access, it's still not helpful for the ultimate goal of utilizing the insurance information.

"Akka kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu imaammata irratti hin argamu?","The correct answer is **D: Iimeeyilii abbaa imaammataa** (Email of the Imam's father).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the Imam needs to provide *their own* email and phone number to the insurance company. It doesn't mention providing the email of their father. The other options (phone number for insurance, insurance email, and phone number to help find information) are all things the Imam is instructed to provide.

Therefore, the Imam's father's email is the one item *not* mentioned as needed.
"
"Akka kutichaatti, foormaatiiwwan fiilmii kamtu baay’inaan hojiirra oola?","The correct answer is **A: Negativa 6 x 6 cm**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kun qulqullina agartuu kan negatiivii 35mm caalaa harka afur kan ta’u kenna (3136mm2 gara 864 tti wal caala). **Yoo of-harkaa fixxe, inni yeroo baayyee haala salphaatti deebi’ee guutamuu danda’a, akkasumas qulqullina tilmaamaan DSLR ammaa waliin madaalamuu danda’u kenna Kaameeraa format giddu galeessaa muraasni kan fayyadaman formaati 6 fi 6, sirriitti ibsuuf kan negatiiva 56 fi 56 mm fayyadaman.**""

This clearly indicates that the 6x6 format is being discussed as a format that offers a higher level of detail compared to 35mm, and the 56x56mm negative is associated with this 6x6 format. The other options are mentioned as negative sizes but not as the format offering the improved detail described in the text.
"
kanneen armaan gadii keessaa dandeettii guddisee agarsiisuu DSLR wajjin wal fakkaatu qaba?,"The correct answer is **C: Fiilmii 56 x 56 mm**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kun qulqullina agartuu kan negatiivii 35mm caalaa harka afur kan ta’u kenna (3136mm2 gara 864 tti wal caala)."" This translates to: ""This allows a negative image quality four times better than 35mm (3136mm2 to 864 times).""  It then explains that the format being discussed is 6x6, using 56x56mm negatives.

Therefore, the 56x56mm film format is the one that offers a significantly higher image quality compared to 35mm film, making it a closer comparison to the image quality achievable with a DSLR.
"
"Akka kutichaatti, kanneen keessaa tarkaanfii dhumaa imala daldalaa barreessuu jalqabuuti?","The correct answer is **B: Keewwata biloogii imala beekamaa baay’ee barreessuu.**

Here's why:

The question asks what you need to *start* learning to use a ""karaan salphaan imala daldalaa barreessuu"" (which translates roughly to ""advanced financial analysis tool""). The prompt says you need to build a foundation in biology and knowledge.  Therefore, the most logical first step is to learn a lot about the underlying biology/knowledge of financial analysis.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Bocuu marsaariitii shaakaluu (Practicing using the spreadsheet):** You can't effectively practice *using* a tool without understanding the principles behind it.
* **C: Marsariitii mataa kee ijaaruu (Straining your eyes):** This is irrelevant to learning the tool.
* **D: Dandeetii gulaallii ofii cimsuu (Improving your eyesight):**  Also irrelevant to learning the tool.



"
"Yeroo imala daldalaa barreessuu itti jalqabamu, dandeettii armaan gadii keessaa kamtu dura dhabamsiifamuu qaba?","The correct answer is **A: Ibsa kennuu (Giving information)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what skill needs to be initially impaired when starting to learn to write scientific papers. The text states: ""Karaan salphaan imala daldalaa barreessuu ittiin jalqaban..."" which translates to ""Starting with the process of writing a scientific paper..."".  The following sentence says you need to learn to ""present your ideas clearly and effectively.""

Therefore, the foundational skill that needs to be developed *first* is the ability to *give information* in a clear and organized manner.  The other options are skills that come later in the process:

*   **Boca Marsariitii (Researching/Finding information):** This is necessary *before* you can present information.
*   **C: Gulaaluu (Organizing):**  This is essential *after* you have information to present.
*   **D: Marsariitii kalaquu (Creating a literature review):** This is a more advanced skill that builds on presenting information.



"
Haala qilleensaa gosa kam keessatti dhibeen mar’ummaanii bay’inaan argama?,"The correct answer is **C: Haala qilleensaa ho’aa** (Cutaneous/Skin infection).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""bakka siif itti baakteeriyoolojiikaliin fuwaanaa haaraa ta’eetti, ati gara rakkootti deemudhaaf baayee fagoo dha."" This translates to ""In a place where it's bacteriologicaly contaminated with hair follicles, you often speak of it as a problem."" This refers to skin infections related to hair follicles.
* The text then goes on to discuss bacteria thriving in environments with dead skin cells (""qilleensa ho’aa"").
* The examples of historical sites (Delhi Sultanate, Montezuma's tomb) are given because they contain a lot of dead skin cells, which allowed for bacterial growth and infections.

Therefore, the entire passage focuses on **cutaneous/skin infections** caused by bacteria interacting with dead skin cells.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, Haala idileedhaan saaxilamuun madiinummaa maaliitti geeesa?","The correct answer is **C: Rakkina Hargansuu (Infectious Diseases)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how bacteria can thrive in environments like ancient burial sites (like those of Pharaohs and Montezuma) and in the soil of Delhi.  It connects this to the spread of infectious diseases. The passage specifically mentions that while bacteria naturally exist, they become dangerous when conditions are right, leading to outbreaks of infectious diseases. 

The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Rakkina Mar’ummaanii (Chronic Diseases):** The passage focuses on infectious diseases, not chronic ones.
*   **B: Jarmoota naannoo (Local Tribes):** The text doesn't mention local tribes.
*   **D: Garaa kaasaa imaltootaa (Source of Ancient Artifacts):** While ancient sites are mentioned, the focus is on the bacteria and the diseases they can cause, not just the artifacts themselves.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa faayidaa biyyoota zoonii Shengen keessa imaluu kan ta’e kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Iyyannoo viisaa baay’ee hambisuu (Reduce visa processing time)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Schengen Zone allows travelers to move freely between countries *without* needing to show their passport at each border. This significantly reduces the time and hassle associated with visa processing, as you only need one Schengen visa to travel throughout the zone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qarshii qusachuu (Spending money)** - While travel involves expenses, the Schengen visa system isn't primarily about reducing spending.
*   **C: Buufata sakatta’iinsa paaspoortii baay’ee hambisuu (Reducing passport stamping)** - The text says you *don't* need passport stamps at each border within the Schengen zone.
*   **D: Paaspoortiin sirraa barbaadamuu dhiisuu (Ignoring passport application)** - You still need to *apply* for a passport, but the Schengen visa simplifies travel within the zone.

Therefore, the most accurate benefit highlighted in the text is the reduction in visa processing time.
"
Bakka awwaalcha Tutankhamunitti kan hin argamne isa kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Qaabenya meeshaaleewwanii (Treasures)**.

The passage states: ""Qabeenyaan bakkee awwaalaa sana keessa jiraamee dubbatamaa ture, garuu gara Muuziyeemii Masir isa Kaayiroo keessaatti geeffamee jira."" This translates to: ""It was said that treasures were in the burial place, but it has been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.""

Therefore, the treasures were not found in the actual burial chamber (KV62).
"
"Akka kutichaatti, imaltoota baasii gadi bu’aa barbaadaniif bakkee Vaankover isa kamtu badaa hawwataa hin ta’u? ","The correct answer is **A: Odola Granvil**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""karaa taaksii bishaanii beellamaan oddoloa Granviil goda magaalaa Vaankooverii bahaniin salphaatti deemamuu ni danda’a."" (You can easily get there by a short water taxi from downtown Vancouver.)

The other options are either too general (like ""Kooridooriin Galaanaa"" or ""Ayislaandii Boween"") or described as requiring longer travel times or specific interests (like ""Wiisler""). Granvil Island is the only location mentioned as easily accessible from downtown Vancouver.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Daawwattootaaf muuxannoo Vaankooverii isa sirrii bakki kennuu danda’u isa kami?","The correct answer is **C: Magaalaa walakkaa Vaankooverii (Downtown Vancouver)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hawaasni dhugaan kun Howe Saawund Vaankover keessaa akka bahame, keessatti argama; karaa taaksii bishaanii beellamaan oddoloa Granviil goda magaalaa Vaankooverii bahaniin salphaatti deemamuu ni danda’a."" This translates to: ""This vibrant community can be found in the Howe Sound of Vancouver; it can be reached by a short bus ride from Granville Street, a downtown area of Vancouver.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ayislaandii Boween (Iceland Bowen):** The passage mentions Bowen Island as a place for outdoor activities, but not as a location for Vancouver visitors.
*   **B: Wiisler (Whistler):** Whistler is mentioned as a destination, but not as a location *within* Vancouver suitable for visitors. It's a bit outside the city.
*   **D: Odola Granvil (Granville Island):** Granville Island is mentioned as a starting point for a bus ride *to* downtown Vancouver, not as a place where visitors would primarily stay or find information.

Therefore, downtown Vancouver is the best answer."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Imaltoonni daawwannaa finca’aa dhorkaa malee daawwachuu yoo barbaadan yoom ta’uu qaba?","The correct answer is **C: Yeroo bishaan ol ka’u (When the rains stop)**.

The passage states: ""Waqtii roobaa keessa (Sadaasaa hanga Bitootessaatti), qabiyyeen bishaanii ol ka’a, Fincaa’aawwan immoo daran saffisa godhatu."" This translates to ""During the dry season (from June to October), the rains stop, and the tobacco plants grow rapidly, while the tobacco farmers work hard.""  It then explains that during this time, the tobacco leaves are at their best and visitors can witness the whole process.
"
"Akka kutichaatti, Gaarummaan Viiktooriyaa Foolsii Sadaasaa fi Bitootessa gidduu ji’oota jiran keessa daawwachuu maali?","The correct answer is **C: Ilaalcha finca’aa bareedaa**.

The passage states: ""Waqtii roobaa keessa (Sadaasaa hanga Bitootessaatti), qabiyyeen bishaanii ol ka’a, Fincaa’aawwan immoo daran saffisa godhatu. Yoo riqicha qaxxaamurtan wabii jiidhuu qabdan yookaan gara kallattii bubbee Fincaa’aa cinaatti deemaa. Karaa biraatiin, sirriitti sababa qabiyyeen bishaanii baayyee olka’aa ta’eef ilaalchikee fincaa’aa isa sirrii si jalaa dhokata—hunduma bishaaniin!""

This translates to: ""During the rainy season (from June to October), the herdsmen rise up, and the cattle farmers work very hard. If the cattle have been grazing in the outskirts or the cattle farmer has taken the cattle to the pasture, the reason for the herdsmen rising up is visible in the fields—everything with the rain!""

The passage highlights that the rainy season offers a *unique* view of the cattle farming operations, particularly how the herdsmen and cattle farmers manage their livestock.  Therefore, it emphasizes the opportunity to see the cattle farming process in detail.  Options A, B, and D are not directly supported by the passage's focus on the rainy season and cattle farming.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa yeroo fiilmiin dirooniidhaan waraabamu kan hin gorfamne kami?","The correct answer is **A: Waanta waraabuuf siif heyyamame dursa baruu (Going to the place that was arranged for the filming first)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the importance of going to the pre-arranged filming location *before* anything else. It states that if you don't ask about something beforehand, you won't be able to film. It also mentions quickly getting ready for filming and clarifying what needs to be done and any additional requirements.  The text directly links going to the designated filming spot as a crucial first step.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Heyyama dabalataa argachuu (Getting additional requirements):**  While clarifying requirements is important, the text prioritizes *going to the location first.*
* **C: Heyyama qorannoo geggeessuu (Conducting a research requirement):** Research is not mentioned as a prerequisite in the text.
* **D: Iddoo walitti tuuta’aa dirooniin itti hin hubatamne qofa waraabuu (Only filming an unknown meeting place):**  The text specifically warns against filming sensitive or private areas without permission, and the focus is on having a *known* location.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, iddoon filatamoo dirooniidhaan waraabuuf ta’an kami?","The correct answer is **A: Naannoo namni itti baay’atu ta’ee jiraachuun diroonii ikan saan hin dhibne.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Naannoo buufata xiyyaaraa bira fi bakkee namni itti baay’attu irra balaliisuun yaada badaa dha, yooma naannoo keessaniitti seeraan ala ta’uu baatellee."" This translates to: ""It is a bad thing to make a video in a place where a sacred area or a place frequented by people is located, as the elders have said in our region.""

Therefore, the video location should *not* be in a place frequented by people. Option A, which states that the video is fine as long as it's not in a place frequented by people, accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Naannoo itti suuraan idilee hin eeyyamamne:**  This translates to ""A location that is not a sacred place."" While not being a sacred place is important, the passage emphasizes *avoiding places frequented by people* even if they aren't explicitly sacred.
* **C: Bakka muddamaa dirooniin badaa itti hin argamne:** This translates to ""A location where a bad video is not seen.""  This is irrelevant to the core issue of where the video is filmed.
* **D: Iddoo itti kanaan dura eeyyama fudhatte:** This translates to ""A location that was previously accepted.""  The passage is establishing new guidelines, not referring to previous practices.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee wantoota galmee viizaaf barbaachisanii ilaalchisee kamtu dhugaa miti?","The correct answer is **A: Bakka turistootaaf qophaa’e turta yoo ta’e, kamiif galmaa’uun sirraa hin eegamu** (If you are staying at a tourist accommodation, it is not necessarily required to be registered).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that in many countries, hotels (upon request) are required to register guests. However, it also mentions that registration is typically only required for those staying in tourist accommodations.  Therefore, if you are staying at a tourist-designated place, you may not need to register.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Biyyi hundumtuu bulchiinsa naannootiin akka galmaa’u barbaadu** (Every country requires registration with the local authorities): The text indicates this isn't universally true. Some countries rely on tourist accommodations for registration.
* **C: Gara waajjira dhimma lammummaa deemuun barbaachisuu danda’a** (You can contact the immigration office to do so): While contacting the immigration office *might* be an option in some situations, the text doesn't say this is a standard or required procedure. It's less common than registering at a hotel.
* **D: Bakka muraasatti, hoteelonni naannoo galmee sana raawwachuu ni danda’u** (In some cases, hotels can carry out that registration): This is mentioned in the text.  However, it's not the *only* possibility, and the text implies registration might happen through other means as well (depending on the country).



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa bakka daawwataan galmaa’uuf hin deemne kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Hoteela buufatanitti (At hotels)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Biyyoota baayyee seera akkasii qaban keessatti, hoteelonni naannoo jiran galmee ni raawwatu (Akka gaafattu mirkaneessi)..."" which translates to ""In many countries with such laws, hotels in the region carry out registration (upon request)...""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Buufata poolisii nannoo (Regional police office):** The text says you might be asked to go to the police, not that the police office is where registration happens.
* **C: Buufata poostaa naannootti (Regional post office):** The text doesn't mention post offices.
* **D: Waajjira dhimma lammummaa (Immigration department):** While related, the text focuses on hotels as the primary registration point in many countries.



"
"Yeroo imalaatti, tola ooltummaa irraa eenyutu fayyadamaa hin ta’u?","The correct answer is **A: Nama hiriyaa biyya bakkee irraa baafachuu barbaadu (Someone who wants to escape from the local area).**

Here's why:

The text states that traveling to the Oromo region is a good way to experience different customs, meet new people, see new sights, and experience new things. It also mentions spending a significant amount of money for a long time.

Option A, ""Someone who wants to escape from the local area,"" is a potential motivation for such a trip. While the text doesn't explicitly state this as *what someone *won't* get from the trip, it's the least likely outcome. The text highlights the positive experiences gained, which are not directly related to wanting to *escape* from one's current location.

Let's look at why the other options are more likely benefits:

* **B: Nama kaffaltii olaanaa ta’e barbaadu (Someone who wants excellent quality)** - The text mentions spending money for a long time, implying the potential for good quality experiences.
* **C: Nama ogummaa haaraa barachuu barbaadu (Someone who wants to learn traditional skills)** - The text explicitly mentions experiencing customs and traditions.
* **D: Nama dhiyeessii nyaataa fi bakka ciisichaatti gammaduu danda’u (Someone who can be happy with simple food and lodging)** - The text mentions needing a budget for food and lodging, suggesting a focus on experiencing the local way of life, which often involves simple pleasures.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, tola ooltummaan yeroo biyya bakkee imaltoota karaa baajataa akkamitti fayyaduu danda’a?","The correct answer is **D: Miira ilaalcha kan biraa argachuu si gargaaruu danda’a** (It can help you gain knowledge of other cultures).

Here's why:

The text describes traveling to Oromia for various reasons, including experiencing different cultures, meeting new people, seeing new sights, and gaining new knowledge. Option D directly reflects this aspect of cultural enrichment.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kaffaltiin yeroo hundumaa hamma jechuun danda’amutti ni kennama** (Donations are given all the time): While donations might be part of the experience, the text doesn't emphasize this as the primary use of travel funds.
*   **B: Yeroo hedduu gara carraa hojiitti geessa** (Mostly used for work): The text states that travel *can* be for work, but it's not the overarching purpose. The text highlights cultural and personal growth more.
*   **C: Nyaataa fi bakki ciisichaa takka takka ni qophaa’a** (Collects food and lodging everywhere): While food and lodging are part of the expense, the text points out that this travels are intended to be for a longer time and therefore budgeting for food and lodgings are key in maintaining the journey.

"
"Akka kutichaatti, Imala giddu-galeessaa gara Woolti Diiznii Woorlidiitti taasifamu baratamaa hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **C: Guutummaa turtii imalichaa bakka Diizniitti dabarsuu (Transferring the entire content of the castle to Disney)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Adda addummaa hedduu dhuma hin qabnetu jira, garuu kun waan namoonni hedduu jechuu barbaadanii dha gaafa waa’ee “gara Addunyaa Ashangulitii deemna jedhan”. **Kun sochii baay’ee baratamaa ta’ee utuma jiruu, Dizniidhaan dhorkamaadha: tikeeticha nama biraatti dabarsuun hin danda’amu.**"" (Although there wasn't much new content, this is what many people wanted to say about the ""Adventure World"" castle. This is a very baratamaa (difficult/unrealistic) initiative, and Disney has stated: tickets cannot be transferred to another person.)

This means transferring the *entire* castle's content is the most unrealistic and therefore ""baratamaa"" (difficult/unrealistic) option presented. The other options, while perhaps challenging, are within the realm of possibility (building a hotel, getting a press release, transferring tickets).

Therefore, option C is the best fit for the question.
"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee Woolti Diiznii Woorlidii kamtu dhugaa miti?,"The correct answer is **A: Tikeetii park hooppar daawwataa biraaf dabarsuun ni danda’ama** (It is possible to transfer a park hopper ticket to another visitor).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: **""Tikeeticha nama biraatti dabarsuun hin danda’amu.""** (It is not possible to transfer a ticket to another person.)

Let's look at why the other options are potentially true based on the text:

* **B: Bakka sanatti Manni xiqqoon ni argama** (There are small houses in that place) - The text mentions ""qabeenyaa Disnii utuu gad-hin dhiisin naannoo torban tokkoo achitti dabarsuu"" (transferring one territory of Disney's assets without losing it there). This *could* imply some structures, though it doesn't specify ""houses.""
* **C: Atoobisoonni imaltoota buufata xiyyaaraa hamma hoteelaatti geessaan ni argamu** (You can find characters of the attractions at all hotels) - The text mentions characters from the ""buufata xiyyaaraa"" (shows) appearing at the park. It doesn't say they are available at *all* hotels.
* **D: Tikeetonni guyyaa baay’eef gargaaran caalbaasii toora inarneetaa irratti ni argamu** (Park hopper tickets for multiple days can be found on the internet) - The text clearly states ""Tikeetonni guyyaa baay’eef gargaaran caalbaasii toora inarneetaa irratti ni argamu"" (Park hopper tickets for multiple days can be found on the internet).

Therefore, option A is the only statement *directly contradicted* by the text."
"Akka kutichaatti, dhimmoota armaan gadii keessaa kan carraan kutaalee leenjii yookiin gaazexaawwan irratti kaafamuu isaa xiqqaa ta’e kami?","The correct answer is **A: Lafa onaa keessatti baraaramuu** (Regional newspapers).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kitaabolee fi Gaazexaawwan lafa onaa keessatti baraaramuu irratti xiyyeeffatan beekamoodha, garuu maxxansaaleen zooniiwwan waraanaa ilaallatan muraasa.""  This translates to: ""Regional newspapers that focus on the regional economy are important, however, publications that look at regional war zones are also important.""

The question asks which of the options refers to topics from the regional newspapers or newspapers that focus on the regional economy.  ""Lafa onaa keessatti baraaramuu"" directly translates to ""regional newspapers,"" which are the newspapers that cover the regional economy. The other options refer to specific activities related to observing the war, not the newspapers themselves.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, mata dureewwan armaan gadii keessaa carraan kutaa leenjii keessatti kaafamuu isaa guddaa ta’e kami?","The correct answer is **A: Yaala jalqabaa (First aid)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leenjiin guyyaa 2-5 barbaada akkasuma ga’ee taphachuu barbaada, yaalaa jalqaba baay’ee fi yeroo tokko tokkoo yaalii rasaasaas."" This translates to: ""They want to practice drills 2-5 days a week, with a lot of first aid and occasional live fire drills.""

Therefore, first aid (yaalaa jalqabaa) is mentioned as a particularly emphasized drill during the training. The other options are mentioned, but not with the same level of emphasis as first aid.
"
"Akka kutichaatti, bishaan qulqulleessuudhaaf filannoon gaarii ta’e isa kami?","The correct answer is **B: Bishaan qaruuraa awwagama bitachuu (Choosing a well-known company's branded water)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that while many water brands exist, only a few are truly good and deliver quality. It specifically advises choosing a branded water from a reputable company. The other options are explicitly stated as being *not* ideal:

*   **A: Daqiiqota hedduudhaaf bishaan danfisuu (Water that takes many minutes to fill):** The passage states the ideal filling time is very short (a minute or less).
*   **C: Daqiiqaa tokkoof bishaan danfisuu (Water that takes one minute to fill):** While short, the passage doesn't prioritize this over quality.
*   **D: Rakkoo bishaanichi fiduu danda’au addatti sakatta’uu (Considering the bottle's material):** While important, the passage prioritizes the water's quality and brand over the bottle's material.



Therefore, the passage strongly suggests focusing on the water's origin (the brand) as the primary factor in choosing a good water brand.



"
"Akka kutichaatti, Bishaan daaktota ogummaa isaa qabaniif illee tasa danda’amuu dhiisuu kan malu maali?","The correct answer is **C: Gara dambaliitti deebi’anii daakuu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Duuti baayyeen kan uumamu sababa dadhabbii gara dambaliitti deebi’anii daakuuf yaaluu irraa dhufuuni, wanta tarii hin danda’amne."" This translates to: ""The most common cause of the moon's fall is the desire to return to the dark spot, something they cannot do.""  Therefore, the moon tries to return to the dark spot (dambaliitti deebi'anii daakuu).

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

*   **A: Kattaatti siquudhaan daakuu** -  The text doesn't mention the moon falling *with* the cat.
*   **B: Bishaan gad fagoo keessa daakuu** - The text describes the moon falling *towards* the dark spot, not *into* a hole.
*   **D: Naannoo dambalii daakuu** - While the moon tries to go to the dark spot, the text doesn't specify that it falls *into* a dark spot region.



"
Yoo dambaliin sitti dhufe maal gochuu qabda?,"The correct answer is **B: Gara dambaliitti deebi’anii daakuu (Return to the place where the scorpion fell).**

The passage explicitly states: ""Duuti baayyeen kan uumamu sababa dadhabbii gara dambaliitti deebi’anii daakuuf yaaluu irraa dhufuuni, wanta tarii hin danda’amne."" This translates to: ""The most common cause of death is from the scorpion's venom, which comes from trying to return to the place where it fell, something they cannot do.""

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the information provided in the passage.
"
"Akka kutichaatti, bakka kamtu daandii bishaanii lafarraa ayyaana bu’uuraan naannessuuf dhaamsa gaarii dha?","The correct answer is **C: Sulula Rhine**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Fakkenyaaf gamoowwan daawwachuun Sulula Loire keessatti, sulula Rhine yookiin bashannanaaf gara magaalota babbareedani karaa Danube yookiin bo'oo Erie keessa bidiruun deemuu."" This translates to: ""For example, tourists travel along the Loire River, the Rhine River, or the Danube River to reach major cities.""

Therefore, the Rhine River is listed as one of the rivers people travel along for scenic beauty.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the cultural norms in the mentioned regions (Sahel, Atlantic coast) discourage premarital sexual relations.  It emphasizes that women are expected to speak respectfully about their virginity and that young people should avoid engaging in sexual activity before marriage.  Option A directly reflects this central point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Garaagarummaan aadaa amala humnaanii kaasuu akka danda’au hubachuu (Understanding how to demonstrate cultural pride):** While the passage mentions respecting cultural traditions, it doesn't highlight the importance of *demonstrating* pride in a specific way.
*   **C: Faayawwan calaqqisan uffachuu hambisuu (Avoiding unnecessary expenses):** This isn't mentioned at all in the passage.
*   **D: Yeroo barbaachisutti cimina fayyadamuu (Using strength/skill when needed):** While the passage mentions men being strong and capable, this isn't a core cultural norm discouraged. It's presented as a positive trait.

"Iddoo kuticha keessatti ibsame irratti hundaa’uudhaan, dubartootaaf gorsa gaarii kan ta’u kami?","The correct answer is **A: Hordofamuun waan baratame akka hin taane beekuu** (Knowing that what you have been taught is not correct).

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that women should be aware that the traditional practices they've been taught regarding marriage and relationships aren't necessarily the only or best way. They are encouraged to understand that they can enter relationships while respecting their cultural values and that they don't have to tolerate abuse or mistreatment.  Option A directly reflects this core message: knowing that what you've been taught isn't the complete truth is a crucial step towards making informed and empowering choices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Haala gaa’elaa ibsuuf qubeelaa guddaa keewwachuu** (Reporting abuse to a large group): While reporting abuse is important, the text doesn't specifically prioritize large-scale reporting as the *best* advice for women. It focuses more on individual empowerment and understanding.
*   **C: Garaagarummaan aadaa ejjennoo kee hambisuu akka ibsu hubachuu** (Knowing how to discard your cultural traditions):  The text doesn't advocate for discarding cultural traditions entirely.  It encourages a balanced approach – respecting traditions while not being bound by harmful ones.
*   **D: Haala keessa ba’aa hin barbaadamnetti, dhiira ofirraa deebisuutti jabaachuu** (Without seeking internal comfort, be strong and stand your ground with men): This option is too forceful and lacks the nuance of the text, which advocates for healthy relationships and boundaries, not simply being strong and standing one's ground without consideration for the other person's feelings.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’uudhaan, nama bineensota bosonaa suuraa kaasuuf leensii addaa fayyadamuun yoom isa barbaachisa?","The correct answer is **A: Uumamoota xixiqqoo yeroo waraaban (Small, moving objects)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Suuraan bineensota daggalaa kaasun kaameeraa leensii dheeraa qabu gaafata, wantootni akka gurmuu simbiraa ykn uumama xixxiqqaa ta’an leensi adda biraa barbaadu.""  This translates to: ""To capture small, moving objects, a camera with a long lens is needed, and things like a hummingbird or a small creation require a different lens.""

Options B, C, and D are mentioned in the passage as *potential* reasons for taking photos, but the passage directly links the need for a long lens to capturing *small, moving objects*.
"
kanneen armaan gadii keessaa namoota suuraa bineensota bosonaa kaasaniif akka rakkinaatti kan hin eeramne kami?,"The answer is **C: Gosa leensii barbaadamu argachuu (Finding the desired lens)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bineensota daggalaa kaasun kaameeraa leensii dheeraa qabu gaafata, wantootni akka gurmuu simbiraa ykn uumama xixxiqqaa ta’an leensi adda biraa barbaadu."" (When taking pictures of external objects, a camera with a long lens is needed, while objects like a snail or a small creation require a different lens.)  This implies finding the *right* lens for the subject is a challenge.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Bineensota fagoorraa dhufan muraasa (Few approaching animals):** The passage mentions animals can be challenging to photograph and might require patience, but it doesn't specifically say that *few approaching animals* are a *problem*.
* **B: Bineensota hamoo wajjin walitti ba’uu (Interacting with animals):** The passage mentions animals can be difficult, but doesn't highlight *interacting with* them as a specific obstacle.
* **D: Naannoo hin mijanne keessatti hojjechuu (Working in non-glaring areas):**  The passage doesn't mention glare as a problem. It focuses on the challenges of subject matter and lens choice.



Therefore, finding the appropriate lens is directly mentioned as a challenge in the passage, making it the correct answer."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa konkolaachisaa karaa garaa irra imalaniif carraa rakkina ta’uu dhiphaa kan qabu?,"The correct answer is **B: Rigata xiqqoo (Small cracks)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Daandiiwwan cabbii fi huurriin uwwifaaman irratti, rigatni isaa xinnaa kan ta’ee fi akka waan asfaaltii qullaarra jirtuutti oofuu hin dandeessu.""  This translates to: ""On cracks and small potholes, its crack is such that it cannot be filled like asphalt.""

Therefore, small cracks are specifically mentioned as a weakness that makes the road prone to damage. The other options are not discussed in the text as primary causes of road damage related to the characteristics of asphalt.
"
Waa’ee gibira galii biyyoota garaagaraa keessatti dhaabbataadhaan walfakkaachuu kan danda’u maali?,"The correct answer is **C: Iddoo itti galmooftu** (Jurisdiction).

Here's why:

* **The question asks about what allows a data breach to be coordinated across different countries.** The text explains that data breaches are diverse and vary geographically, with different laws and regulations.
* **""Iddoo itti galmooftu"" (Jurisdiction)** refers to the legal authority to govern a particular area. For a data breach to be handled collectively across countries, a shared jurisdiction or a framework for cooperation between jurisdictions is necessary.  This allows for coordinated investigation, prosecution, and remediation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hamma kaffaltii (All regulations):** While regulations are important, they don't inherently allow for coordinated action across multiple jurisdictions. Regulations can be different and conflicting.
* **B: Caasaa (Laws):** Similar to regulations, laws alone don't ensure coordinated action.  Different legal systems require specific mechanisms for collaboration.
* **D: Sadaala (Power/Authority):** While power and authority are related, ""iddoo itti galmooftu"" is a more precise term for the legal basis for coordinated action.

Here's why:

The passage states that the location where you generate data (where you are located) is crucial for data privacy regulations.  It also mentions that data privacy laws vary by country.  If your work location is abroad, the data privacy regulations of the *country where you are currently working* will apply.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iddoo ati bu’uureffatte (The place you are established):**  While your established location is important, it's less relevant when you're working for an employer based elsewhere.
*   **B: Yuunaayitid Isteeti keessatti (In the United States):** This is too specific.  The question asks generally about working abroad, not *specifically* in the US.  The applicable country depends on where the work is actually being done.
*   **D: Iddoo itti kaffaltiin kee xiqqoo ta’e (The place where your payment is small):**  This is completely irrelevant to data privacy regulations. The size of your payment has no bearing on the applicable laws.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Waltajiileen kunneen barteedhaan ji’a sadiif jaha gidduu kan turuu, fi bakkeewwan hektaara 50 gad hin taaneetti geggeeffamu.""  This translates to ""These exhibitions are held for three to six months, and in areas not exceeding 50 hectares.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wanti agarsiifamu seenaa yookiin aadaa biyyichaa mul’isuu mala (What is exhibited may be the history or culture of the country):** While true (mentioned in the text), it doesn't address *how long* the exhibitions last.
* **B: Agarsiisni abaaboo, agarsiisa aartii fi barnootaa wajjin dhiyaata (The exhibition is held with a historical, art, and educational display):**  Again, true (mentioned in the text), but it doesn't answer the question about the duration.
* **D: Biyyootni hirmaachuun irraa hin eegamu (Countries are not excluded from participating):** The text doesn't say anything about countries being excluded.  It emphasizes that participation is open to a wide range of countries.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Waltajiileen kunneen barteedhaan ji’a sadiif jaha gidduu kan turuu..."" which translates to ""These events last for three to six months.""
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Wanti agarsiifamu seenaa biyyaa fi dhimmota addunyaa agarsiisuu qaba (What is exhibited must show the history of the country and world problems):** While true, this is a *purpose* of the exhibition, not a defining characteristic of *when* it happens.
    * **B: Biyyi tokko waggaa waggaan walitti aansuun saganticha qopheessuu hin dandeessu (A country cannot assemble the event year after year):** The passage says countries *don't* do it annually, but they *do* participate periodically (every three to six months).
    * **D: Agarsiisichi qophaa’uuf, biyyoonni hundumtuu irratti hirmaachuu qabu (For the exhibition to be held, all countries must participate):** The passage says it's not held annually, implying not all countries participate every year.

Gochaa ramaan gadii keessaa kamtu carraa miidhama bineensotaa hir’isa?,"The correct answer is **C: Yeeyyiiwwan irraa Yaardii 25 fagaachhuu** (Staying 25 yards from elk).

The text explicitly states: ""Akka aangawoota paarkiitti, ‘beerii’ fi yeeyyii irraa yoo xiqqaate yaardii/meetira 100, bineensota biroo hunda irraa ammoo yaardii/meetira 25 fagaadhaa!"" (In the park's campgrounds, if you pass by 'deer' and elk, stay 100 yards away, and from all other bison, stay 25 yards away!).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baala fooliin baay’ee urgaa’u qabachuu** (Having a lot of foliage on the ground): While foliage might attract animals, it's not a direct way to avoid encounters.
*   **B: Kosii bakka buufatanii gatuu** (Camping in a designated area):  Camping in a designated area is good practice, but it doesn't guarantee safety from animals.
*   **D: Haftee nyaataa irraa bineensota ari’uu** (Avoiding food smells): Avoiding food smells is important, but it's not the primary distance recommendation.



"
"Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa, akka bineensa miidhuu danda’uutti kuticha keessatti kan hin eeramne kami?","The correct answer is **A: Foolii cimaa (Strong scent)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dabalataan, fooliin akka biirii fi bineensota bosona biro akka harkisu hubadhu ,kanaafuu nyaata foolii qabu baachuu fi tolchuu irraa of qusadhu babadhu akkasumas kaampii qulqullinaan eegi."" This translates to: ""Furthermore, it is known that animals like bison and other wild animals can smell a strong scent. Therefore, avoid using scented soaps and perfumes and set up camp cleanly.""

Therefore, a strong scent (foolii cimaa) is something that shouldn't be used to avoid attracting these animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fageenya eeggachuu dhiisuu (Avoiding waiting for opportunity):** The text advises caution due to the animals' dangerous nature, not necessarily to avoid waiting for an opportunity.
*   **C: Bineensota nyaachisuu (Feeding animals):** The text explicitly warns against feeding animals.
*   **D: Bineensota namootni hin beekne (Unknown animals):** While the animals are wild and potentially unknown, the question asks what *shouldn't be used* to avoid attracting them, not which animals are dangerous.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Akoordiyoonicha irratti, sagalee dabalataa argachuuf, dhibbaa ykn saffisa dabalataatiin buufaawwan fayyadamtu."" This translates to: ""On the accordion, to get extra notes, you use extra pressure or speed when pumping the bellows.""  Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sagalee dabalataaf, humna ittiin batanii (key) rukuttu dabali:** The text doesn't mention pressing the keys harder to get extra notes.
* **B: Humna kee tursiisuf sochii hin barbaachifne xiqqeessi:**  The text doesn't advise reducing movement to get extra notes.
* **C: Harkee osuma laaffistuu nootawwan rukutuu qalbeeffadhu:**  This option is unrelated to the text's explanation of how to get extra notes on an accordion.

The text states: ""Akoordiyoonicha irratti, sagalee dabalataa argachuuf, dhibbaa ykn saffisa dabalataatiin buufaawwan fayyadamtu."" This translates to: ""On the accordion, to get extra volume, using pressure or extra speed.""  While ""saffisa heddu"" (more speed) and ""humna heddu"" (more force) are related, the text specifically mentions ""dhibbaa ykn gadi qabuu xiqqaa"" (pressure or slight pressure).  Option C best captures this nuance.
"
Televizhiinii irratti suurawwan fiixensaanii maalif cita?,"The correct answer is **B: Suurri iskiriinii guutee akka mul’atuuf**

Here's why:

The text states that the ""garmalee iskaan gochuu"" (zoom/enlargement) is done to make the images on DVD look clearer and more vibrant, especially when the video has a small frame. This is achieved by making the screen fill the entire display.  Therefore, the purpose of the fixed images/subtitles is to help the image fill the screen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Barreeffama gajjalaa deemu (subtitles) galchuuf** - While subtitles *can* be on a DVD, the text doesn't mention this as the primary reason for the fixed images. The focus is on image quality.
* **C: Foormatiwwan birootiwwan birootti qunnamtii salphaa hayyamuuf** - This is irrelevant to the topic of fixed images and image quality.
* **D: Barreeffama gajjallaa deemu kan gara gadiitti baay’ee dhiyaate kutuuf** -  This option is not mentioned in the text.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sun garmalee iskaan gochuu jedhama.

This translates to: ""This is called 'skipping'.  As a result, when you play a DVD, your attention doesn't cease, but if the video has a scratch on the disc, the image doesn't appear completely clear.""

Option A directly reflects this problem – a lack of clear or bright screen image (suura iskiriinii hin guunne).  The other options aren't directly mentioned as drawbacks in the passage.

The passage explicitly states: ""Joon Danlaap isa bilookiiwwan muraasa achirraa fagaatutti ergame."" which translates to ""John Danlap, whose copies were sent from there."" The question asks who sent the copies by mail.
"
"Bakkeewwan armaan gadii keessaa, Daanlap yeroo dhumaa kan dhufe eessa ture?","The correct answer is **C: Landan**.

"
Loltoonni Koloneel Istaark eessa buufatanii turan?,"The correct answer is **D: Dallaa fuuldura**.

The passage states: ""Istaarki dhuma kaaba bakkeewwan Qubattoota kolonichaarra dallicharra dalga galanii iddoo qabatan."" This translates to ""Istaarki, with the soldiers of the column, laid a barrier of sawdust and took a position.""  The barrier was made of sawdust (""dallaa fuuldura"").
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti (the passage), namoonni Istaarkis dallaasaanii kan bal’isan yoom ture?","The correct answer is **A: Humni dabalataa akka gargaaraniif yeroo waamaman (Using superior strength when they arrived)**.

The passage states: ""Namoonni Istaarki dhuma kaaba bakkeewwan Qubattoota kolonichaarra dallicharra dalga galanii iddoo qabatan."" This indicates they used their superior strength (as a military unit) to take positions near the Kaaba. The passage also mentions they used grills (likely metal) to create a barrier. This implies they acted quickly and used their strength effectively when they arrived.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Warri idileen erga daangaa (stake) erga darbanii booda (After the locals had driven stakes):** The passage doesn't mention locals driving stakes.
*   **C: Yeroo galaanni gadi galu (When it was time to enter):** The passage focuses on their arrival and securing positions, not about entering at a specific time.
*   **D: Yeroo loltoonni bakkeewwan fuulduraa qabatan (When the loltons had occupied the leather places):** The passage doesn't mention loltons occupying leather places."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Chaayinaatti yeroo jeequmsaa cimaa kan ture kamiidha?","The correct answer is **D: Bara Mootummaa Mootota Sadii (The Era of the Sixteen Kingdoms)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeroowwan kanniin keessaa inni hunda caalaa beekamaan yeroo Mootummoota Sadanii kan waggootii 60maaf Mootummaa Haanii fi Jiin gidduu turedha.""  This translates to ""Among the eras, the era of the Sixteen Kingdoms is most known, spanning 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty."" The passage further describes this era as a time of significant conflict and bloodshed.

While the other dynasties (Han, Jin, and Xi'an) played roles in Chinese history, the passage emphasizes the particularly turbulent and war-filled nature of the Sixteen Kingdoms period.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee garee waraana mixii gulantaa nomaadikii seenanii (army ant colony entering a nomadic phase) kamtu dhugaadha?","The correct answer is **C: Dunkaana guyyaa 17 booda jijjiiramu dhaabu (The colony shifts after 17 days.)**

Here's why:

The text describes a nomadic phase of the army ant colony. It states that the colony moves and searches for food, and during this nomadic phase, the colony shifts its location after 17 days. Option C directly reflects this information. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo gulantaa nomaadikiitti akkaataa dunkaana dhaabbachuu waraana mixii himni sirriitti ibsu kamiidha?","The correct answer is **B: Osoo dunkaana hin dhaabbatin guyyaa 17’f bobba’u**.

This translates to: ""The Tuutni mixiiwwan (mixiiwwan Tuutni) travel with different clans and wander through various areas. When they arrive, these mixed groups, the nomadic people, live and move day by day. This homan (likely referring to a specific location or group) starts to move further away from the grazing lands when the animals get tired. At that time, this homan starts to move slightly day by day. Gradually, the main group or the migrating herd that has wandered and traveled for 17 days is located in an area of the Guya people.""

This indicates that the nomadic groups move *without stopping* for 17 days.  Option B accurately reflects this. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.



"
Mallattoowwan (cues) alaa yoo jiraataniyyuu kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu itti fufa?,"The correct answer is **A: Marsaawwan Indijiiniyesii (Indigenous cues)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rukuttaan yeroo yeroonii, kanneen deebii odeeffannoo alaa yeroo yeroonii qofa hinta’in...""  This translates to: ""The immune system, on occasion, not only receives external information but also..."" This implies that the immune system responds to external signals (marsaawwan alaa).  The text then goes on to describe various things the immune system responds to, including bacteria, fungi, parasites, and even cancerous cells.  The question asks what *specifically* triggers the immune system when external cues are present.

The passage highlights that indigenous cues are a significant factor in triggering immune responses in indigenous populations. While other options *could* influence the immune system, the text specifically focuses on external cues and the response in indigenous populations, making ""Marsaawwan Indijiiniyesii"" the most direct and accurate answer.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ritimiiwwan dhaabbataa (Animal rhythms):** The text doesn't mention animal rhythms as a trigger for immune responses.
* **C: Sa’aatii uumamaa (Time of birth):** While birth time *can* have some influence, it's not the primary focus of the passage concerning external cues.
* **D: Ritimii ilaalamu (alamu rhythms):** The text doesn't discuss alarm rhythms as a direct trigger for immune responses in this context.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer based on the information provided.
"
Jechi nama amala namarraa mul’atu (phenotypic trait) garaagaraa agarsiisu ibsu kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **D: Poolimorphobikii (Polymorphic)**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** refers to the ability of an organism to exhibit different forms or variations of a particular trait. The question states that when organisms show a single trait in different forms, it's called polymorphism.
* **Monomorphic** is the opposite; it refers to organisms that all display the same form of a trait.
* **Organisms** is a general term and not specific to a trait exhibiting variation.
* **Animals** is also too general.



Therefore, the question is asking what term describes the expression of a single trait in multiple forms, which is **polymorphism**.
"
Orgaanizimoota bakka murtaa’aa qabataniif kanneen armaan gadii keessaa jechi sirriin kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **D: Poolimorphobikii**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yeroo namootni dhuunfaa waan amala tokkoof garaagarummaa agarsiisan isaan poolimorfikii jedhamuun beekamu."" (When humans show variability in a single type of trait, they are known as polymorphic).

* **Polymorphicity** refers to the existence of multiple forms or variations within a population for a particular trait. This aligns with the passage's description of humans displaying variability within a single trait.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monoforbikii (Monomorphic):** The passage defines this as when humans all show the same trait, which is the opposite of what the question is asking about.
* **Uummata (Population):** This is a general term for a group of organisms, not a specific type of variation.
* **Sanyiiwwan (Species):** This is a classification of organisms, not a description of variation within a population.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa hojii turizimii uumama irratti hin hundoofne kan ta’e kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **C: Godambaa saayinsii daawwachuu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly lists activities that tourists can do to experience the ""umama"" (a feeling of contentment and happiness) of a place. These include:

*   Seeing local people
*   Enjoying local food
*   Drinking local alcohol
*   Visiting historical sites
*   Visiting parks
*   Visiting attractions like the Orangaatuwaangi Boorniwoo.

Visiting a science museum (Godambaa saayinsii daawwachuu) is *not* mentioned as a typical or expected activity for experiencing the ""umama"" of a place according to the text. The other options (B and D) are implied as being aligned with the activities the text suggests tourists can enjoy.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa hundee mala geejjibaa kan ta’e kami?","The correct answer is **B: Konkolaatawwan dhuunfaa (Private vehicles)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Geejjiba saffisaa bakkee lamaan gidduu deemu kana keessatti namni hundi mala geejjibaa konkolaataawwan dhuunfaa irratti hundaa’e waliin hanga tokko walitti hidhamaniiru, akkasumas deeggaraa jiru."" This translates to: ""In this congestion between two places, everyone relies on private vehicles together, and it's also a problem.""

The passage then connects this reliance on private vehicles to the increase in carbon dioxide and the impact on the biosphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakkeewwan hojii (Workplaces):**  While workplaces are *destinations* people travel to, the passage doesn't say workplaces *themselves* are the congestion.
* **C: Baayosferii tasgabbaa’aa (Biosphere):** The biosphere is the *result* of the congestion and increased carbon dioxide, not the cause of the congestion.
* **D: Jijjiirama dhala namaa (Human evolution):**  Human evolution is mentioned as a long-term process, and while the increased carbon dioxide affects it, it's not the immediate focus of the passage.



"
Partikiloonni nikulasii marsan chaarjii gosa kam qabu?,"The correct answer is **D: Chaarjii poozitiivifi negatiiva**.

Here's why:

* **Protons** have a positive charge.
* **Neutrons** have no charge (they are neutral).
* **Electrons** have a negative charge.

Since atoms contain protons, neutrons, and electrons, the particles within the nucleus have both positive and negative charges.
"
Nikulasiin partikiloota akkamiirraa uumame?,"The correct answer is **D: Pirotoonota, niwutiroonotaafi elektiroonota (Protons, neutrons, and electrons)**.

The text states that a nucleus contains two types of particles: protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge). It also mentions that electrons (negative charge) orbit the nucleus. Therefore, the nucleus is made of protons, neutrons, and electrons.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessa fakkeenya lakkoofsa baayinarii biitii shanii kan ta’e kamiidha?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

The question asks for a binary representation of the number 5.  Let's break down why:

* **Binary uses 0 and 1:**  Each digit in a binary number is either a 0 or a 1.
* **Place Value:**  Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit as 2<sup>0</sup>, then 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, and so on.

To represent 5 in binary:

* 2<sup>2</sup> (4) is less than 5, so we put a 1 in the 2<sup>2</sup> place.
* 5 - 4 = 1.
* 2<sup>1</sup> (2) is greater than 1, so we put a 0 in the 2<sup>1</sup> place.
* 2<sup>0</sup> (1) is equal to 1, so we put a 1 in the 2<sup>0</sup> place.

This gives us 101.

However, the options provided do not include 101. Let's check each option to see which one represents 5.

*   **A: 1010** = (1 * 2<sup>3</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>2</sup>) + (1 * 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>0</sup>) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10
*   **B: 12001**  This is not a standard binary number and would be a very large number.
*   **C: 10010** = (1 * 2<sup>4</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>3</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>2</sup>) + (1 * 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>0</sup>) = 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 18
*   **D: 110101** = (1 * 2<sup>5</sup>) + (1 * 2<sup>4</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>3</sup>) + (1 * 2<sup>2</sup>) + (0 * 2<sup>1</sup>) + (1 * 2<sup>0</sup>) = 32 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 53

None of the options represent the number 5. There might be a typo in the options. Let's analyze each option again.

The problem states the input number is 5, and we have to represent this number in binary.
Let us consider that the binary digits of the number 5 can be represented as:
$5 = 4+1 = 2^2 + 2^0$
$5 = 101_2$
We are given the following choices:
$1010_2 = 10$
$12001_2$ is not a standard binary digit.
$10010_2 = 18$
$110101_2 = 53$
None of the given choices are $101_2$.
There is a typo in the choices. However, if we suppose that the given input number is 10, then the representation of 10 in binary is
$10 = 8+2 = 2^3 + 2^1$
$10 = 1010_2$
Then $10"
Dijiitiwwan baayinarii kan biraa maal jedhamuun beekamu?,"The correct answer is **A: Biitiwwan (Bits)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lakkoofsi baayinarii gatiiwwan lamaa keessa tokko qofa qabachu danda’a, inni 0 yookiin 1, fi lakkofsotni kun akka dijiitii baayinariti beekamu—yookiin baayitsidhaan, afaan koompiyutaara fayyadamuuf.""  This translates to: ""The number binary values can only have one of two, which is 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits—or, in short, computer language.""

Therefore, those digits are called **bits**.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessa akka fayidaa ijoo barataa barreessutti kuticha keessatti kan hin eeramne kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Dandeettii seer-lugaafi barreessuu irratti jijjiirama jiru**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that online tools help students improve their writing skills (""barreeffama fooyyeffatee komii hambisuuf carraaquu eegala""). It also mentions that it helps them express their thoughts clearly (""akka xiinxaltootaa ta’anii fi yaada dhugaa qabeessa akka yaadan dandeessisa"").  However, it *doesn't* explicitly state that online tools improve students' grammar and language skills directly. While implied, the passage focuses more on clarity of expression and the ability to research and present information.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Ceephoon hiriyootarraa kennamuuf hir’achuu:** The passage doesn't discuss the cost of phones.
*   **C: Waa’ee naannoo hubannaa bal’aa qabaachuu:** The passage doesn't mention the improvement of local knowledge.
*   **D: Itti fufiinsan barachuuf fedhiin dabaluu:** While online tools can aid in lifelong learning, the passage's primary focus is on improving writing skills *during* the student's learning process, not specifically on lifelong learning.

Barattoonni dandeettii bareessuu isaanii akka cimsataniif barreessuu bifa kamtu eerame?,"The correct answer is **A: Intarneetirratti yeroo heddu barreeffamootaf deebii kennuu (Tootoo, 2004)**.

The passage explicitly states that students are motivated to write more when they receive feedback on their work, especially through the internet (Tootoo, 2004). It mentions that this feedback helps them improve their writing skills and feel more confident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qeeqa jalaa miliquuf hariifachuu (Baking a cake):** This is irrelevant to the topic of writing skills.
* **C: Fedhii hordoftootasaanii eeguu (Exercising physical strength):** While physical exercise can be beneficial, the passage focuses on cognitive skills and writing.
* **D: Tumsaaf fedhii qabaachuu (Having the ability to endure hardship):**  Endurance is not directly linked to improving writing skills, though it might help with the process of writing longer pieces.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaaa barattootaf fayidaa komunikeeshinii al-kallattii (asynchronous communication) kan hin taane kami? ,"The correct answer is **B: Guyyaatti yeroo kamittuu barsiisota qaaman argachuu (Contacting teachers anytime)**.

Here's why:

* **Asynchronous communication** means communication that doesn't require immediate responses. It allows for exchanging information at different times. 
* **Option B** describes contacting teachers *anytime*. This fits the definition of asynchronous communication. Students can ask questions and receive replies when the teacher has time, not necessarily in real-time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Intarneetii akka maddaatti fayyadamuu (Using the internet as a tool):** The internet enables asynchronous communication (e.g., email, online forums).
* **C: Sa’aatii hojii dhaabbataa hin taane (Non-working hours):** Asynchronous communication often happens outside of regular working hours.
* **D: Saffisa to’achuu (Completing assignments):** Assignment completion is a task, not a type of communication.

Therefore, **B** is the only option that directly relates to asynchronous communication.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, barattootaf fayidaa komunikeeshinii al-kallattii kamtu dhaabbataa kan hin taane miti?","The correct answer is **D: Itti fayyadama intarneetii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Itti fayyadamni intarneetii fi Marsariitii Guutummaa Addunyaa barattoota yeroo hunda odeeffannoo argachuu isaan dandeessisa."" (The use of the internet and the World Wide Web enables students to access information at all times.)  This implies that internet access is a benefit and *not* something that would be considered a negative aspect of communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saffisa ittiin baratan (Learning speed):** The text implies that internet access *enhances* learning speed, not hinders it.
*   **B: Sa’aatii hojii (Working hours):** The text mentions that time is allocated efficiently, suggesting working hours are managed well, not negatively impacted.
*   **C: Meeshaa barnootaa (Learning materials):** The text states that learning materials are provided to students to assist them.

Therefore, the only option that the text indicates is a benefit and *not* a negative aspect of communication is internet usage.

Waanta namni tokko masaraa bara meedicaalii (medieval castles) wajjin wal qabsiisu kan kuticha keessatti hin eeramne maalidha?,"The correct answer is **C: Amala gaarii loltuu (Brutal acts of war)**.

Here's why:

The first question describes the construction of medieval castles and hints at the brutality associated with them (""kottee fardeenii dhagaa afamaarraa dhaga’uun fi sodaa boolla dahannoo keessaa ol aaru suufuun, sagalee fi foolii waraana dur durii gara sammuu ofiitti fiduun salphaadha"" - cutting and drawing blood with a blade, and pouring boiling oil from the roof, and throwing arrows and stones from the walls).

The second question asks what aspect of medieval castles is *not* typically mentioned in the context of their history. While castles were built for defense, the description in the first question focuses on the violent and brutal aspects of warfare *around* the castles. Therefore, the answer is the **brutal acts of war** themselves, as the question implies the focus is on the castle construction and the consequences of conflict, not the war tactics themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boolla dukkanaa (Poisonous oil):** This fits the description of the violent acts.
*   **B: Dorgommii fardaa (Iron defenses):** This is a core aspect of castles - their iron defenses.
*   **D: Loltoota (Knights):** Knights were central to the role and use of castles.

"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa akka foolii ykn sagalee masaraa onaa keessaa dhagahamuu kan kuticha keessatti hin eeramin kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Lolawwan (Legends)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the origin of the world, the creation of humans, and the divine power involved. It mentions the creation of the sun, moon, stars, and the struggle against darkness. The question then asks about the origin of thoughts and the establishment of the first capital.  

The text specifically asks *what* is the basis of our thoughts?  It doesn't mention any of the other options (soda, food, or meat) as relating to the origin of thoughts.  

However, the text speaks of stories and legends being created from the struggles and battles of the gods.  Therefore, **legends** are presented as the foundation upon which our thoughts and understanding of the world are built. They are the narratives passed down through generations that shape our worldview.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa masaraa Kirby Muxloe kan sirriitti ibsu kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Sababa biyyattiin nagaa taatef yeroo ijaarsatti dahoo xiqqaa barbaachisa ture.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Bara 1480moota keessa, yeroo ijaarsi isaa Goofta Hastiingisiin jalqabame, biyyattiin giddu naga-qabeettii turte, akkasumas ittisni kan barbaachisu gaafa balaa geessistoonni garee xiqqoo dhufan qofaa ture.""  This translates to: ""In the 1480s, his campaign began under Lord Hastings, the land was in the middle of peace, and the resistance required only when a small group of rebels arrived.""

* Option B directly reflects this statement about the relatively low resistance because the country was peaceful when the campaign started.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Keenyan yabbuun masarichaaa Loord Hastigis dhaan gaafatame** (Our own army was questioned by Lord Hastings): While Lord Hastings was involved, the passage focuses on the overall resistance level, not specifically on questioning the army.
* **C: Ijaarsi masaraa yerichaaf adda hin turre** (The campaign was not aimed at the country): The passage clearly states the campaign *was* aimed at the country, beginning under Lord Hastings.
* **D: Haleellaa yeroo dheerafi murteessaa ta’e dandamachuuf ijaarame** (It was aimed at demonstrating prolonged and decisive power): The passage indicates the campaign was mostly needed for dealing with a small group of rebels, not to demonstrate prolonged power.



"
Akkaataa ijaarsawwan armaan gadii keessaa waktii kuticha keessatti ibsame sanatti Masaraa Kirby Muxloe kan fakkaatu kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Bu’uura haleellaa dhufu dandamachuuf ijaarame**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bara 1480moota keessa, yeroo ijaarsi isaa Goofta Hastiingisiin jalqabame, biyyattiin giddu naga-qabeettii turte, akkasumas ittisni kan barbaachisu gaafa balaa geessistoonni garee xiqqoo dhufan qofaa ture.""  This translates to: ""In the 1480s, his campaign began under the Earl of Hastings, the country was in the middle of peace, and the only threat was when a small group of rebels arrived.""

This indicates that Masaraa Kirby Muxloe's campaigns were primarily designed to suppress minor rebellions and maintain peace, rather than large-scale warfare.  Option B best reflects this purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Foddaawwan gurguddaa** (Complex formations): The passage doesn't mention anything about complex military formations.
* **C: Masaraawwan tokko tokko caala dahannoo muraasa kan qabu** (Individual knights with limited resources): The passage doesn't focus on individual knights; it describes campaigns.
* **D: Keenyaa furdaa** (Escape route): The passage doesn't mention any escape routes.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa atileetii waktii dhufuuf qophaa’uf baay’ee bu’a qabeessa kan ta’e kamiidha?","The correct answer is **D: Qaama gara olii jabeessuf jiimii fayyadamuu (Using gym exercises to strengthen the upper body)**.

Here's why:

The text states that to achieve the described results (high speed and full body strength), the athlete needs to engage in ""hojii jiminaaziyemii waliin walitti dabalamee"" - which translates to ""coordinated gym exercises.""  The text also mentions the athlete has already trained extensively, with a ""jiminaaziyemii waliin walitti dabalamee"" in addition to regular training. The focus should be on strengthening the upper body, as implied by the emphasis on speed and power.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Yeroo waktii gannaa fiigicha qaxxaamuraa shaakaluu (Focusing on time of day for training):**  While timing can be a factor, the text doesn't highlight the importance of training time. The focus is on the *type* of training.
* **B: Yeroo leenjii saffisa dabaluu irratti xiyyeeffachuu (Focusing on increasing speed during sprints):**  Speed is important, but the text emphasizes *strength* and *full body power*, not just sprint speed.
* **C: Yeroo daqiiqaa sadiin mo’achuu (Running for four minutes):** This is a duration, not a specific type of exercise or strength-building activity.

Therefore, strengthening the upper body through gym exercises is the most logical choice based on the text's description of the athlete's training and desired outcomes.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa nama cimaa walakkaa maayilii fiiguf kamtu baay’ee barbaachisaadha?","The correct answer is **C: Daqiiqaa lamaa gaditti mo’achuu ykn galuu (Spending two minutes to go down)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tokko afraffaa irra gara walakaa maayili figuu jijjiiramuun barbaachisumaa saffisaa saffisaa baay’ee xiqqaataa dhufa akkasumas jabeenyi guutumatti murteessaa ta’aa dhufa.

This translates to: ""Someone who spends two minutes going down the hill gets a very intense feeling of excitement and a complete burning sensation. A skilled downhill skier, for a national championship, combines his excellent physique with intensive training, dedicating all his time to this training. **Someone who can spend two minutes achieves high speed, but sees all the dangerous moments.**""

The passage emphasizes that achieving high speed (saffisa) requires a certain amount of time (two minutes) going down the hill.  Options A, B, and D are incorrect because the passage doesn't suggest focusing on skiing technique (ji'oota gannaatti fiigicha qaxxaamuraa shaakaluu), prioritizing burning calories over speed (Saffisa caalaa cimina jabeessuu), or sacrificing speed for endurance (Cimina caalaa saffisa dabaluu).

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: Daqiiqaa lamaa gaditti mo’achuu ykn galuu.**
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa shaakala nyaataa qofaan atileetin tokko kan hin milkeessine kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Gammachuu dabale (Increased happiness)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the benefits of nutrition for athletes include ""bu'aa uumuu danda'a"" (being able to create benefits) like ""gammachuu isaanii akka dabalaniif"" (increasing their happiness).  While improved physical abilities (options A and C) and overall well-being (option D) are also mentioned, the direct and emphasized benefit connected to nutrition in this passage is increased happiness.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, karaa ittiin atileetonni dargaggeeyyin karaa isaan caalmatti ittiin ispoortitti gammadan kan hin gorfamne kamiidha?","The correct answer is **D: Madaala anniisaa fayyaa eeguu (Maintaining a healthy body)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that while physical strength isn't the primary focus, athletes can benefit greatly from good health. It mentions that maintaining good health helps athletes increase their abilities and feel happier.  Option D directly addresses this by stating the importance of a healthy body.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Nyaata sirrii nyaachuu (Eating a healthy diet):** While a healthy diet contributes to a healthy body, it's not the encompassing answer. The passage emphasizes overall health, not just diet.
*   **B: Dhaabbataadhan sadarkaa olaanan gahuumsa agarsiisuu (Demonstrating excellent technique):** Technique is important in sports, but the passage focuses on the underlying physical well-being that enables good technique.
*   **C: sirriitti dhangala’aa fudhachuu (Accepting defeat gracefully):** This is about mental resilience and sportsmanship, not physical health.

Therefore, **D** best captures the key message of the passage regarding how young athletes can positively experience and thrive in sports."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, namni fageenya giddu galeessa fiigu tokko maalif meeshaalee qaalii bituu mala?","The correct answer is **A: Filannoo dhuunfaa isaaniti (Their personal choice)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that athletes choose equipment based on what they find beneficial. It also notes that many manufacturers have little or no influence on athlete equipment choices. Therefore, the decision to use expensive equipment ultimately comes down to the individual athlete's preference and belief in its value.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fayidaa waan qabuufi (For its usefulness):** While usefulness is a factor, the passage emphasizes *personal choice* over objective usefulness.
* **C: Gahuumsa isaanii irratti jijjiirama cimaa fideera (It significantly affects their performance):** The passage says athletes *don't* necessarily think that the equipment they use has a significant effect on their performance.
* **D: Waa’ee meeshaalee qaalii hin taanee ilaalcha sirrii hin taanetu jira (They don't properly assess inexpensive equipment):**  The passage doesn't say athletes *don't* assess cheaper equipment; it simply says they're not guided by manufacturers in their choice.

Translation: ""If various things are combined with the central hub, it is not a sport, but, looking at the small tools needed for participation, a lot of detailed knowledge is needed.""

This clearly indicates that the central hub requires **many tools** to participate. The other options are incorrect based on the text.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, sochii ykn gochaa qaamaa nama biraa hubachuuf waanti namoonni hubannoo cimaa qabaachuu qaban maalidha?","The correct answer is **D: Hubannoo (Knowledge)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Dhalli Namaa (body language) was created to help people understand what others know, think, believe, feel, or want.  It also emphasizes understanding the *thoughts* of others.  The ability to understand someone's thoughts and feelings stems from **knowledge** – specifically, knowledge gained through observing their body language.

While the other options are related, they aren't the core concept the passage emphasizes:

*   **Hawwii (Desire):**  Body language *can* reveal desire, but it's not the primary focus of the passage.
*   **Niyyaa (Intention):** Similar to desire, intention can be inferred, but the passage is broader than just intention.
*   **Amantaa (Belief):** Beliefs are a part of what body language can reveal, but the passage is about understanding a range of human states.



Therefore, **Hubannoo (Knowledge)** is the most accurate answer based on the passage's meaning."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, niyaa hubachuun namni maal akka godhuuf gargaara?","The correct answer is **A: Shakkii gochaa qaamaa duuba jiru hambisa (It prevents you from making assumptions about the person's intentions).**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that understanding people's intentions allows us to avoid making assumptions. The example of seeing someone looking at a coconut highlights this. If you *assume* they want to eat it, you might misunderstand their actions. Understanding their *intention* (perhaps they're checking for damage or admiring it) prevents you from making a wrong assumption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fedhii raaguf (The ability to respond forcefully):** The passage isn't about reacting forcefully, but about understanding motivations.
* **C: Osoo itti hin murteessin namoota biroo ilaaluu (Observing people without judging):** While observation is involved, the passage focuses on *understanding intentions*, not just passively observing.  The intention is key.
* **D: Waan sammuu namoota biroo keessa jiru dubbisuu (Sharing the feelings inside other people):** The passage is about understanding intentions, not necessarily sharing feelings.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa cuunfaa kaayyoo hubannoo nam-tolchee (AI) inni siirriin kamiidha?","The correct answer is **C: Saganteessuu (Reasoning)**.

Here's why:

The text describes AI's ability to perform tasks like:

* **To’annaa (Learning):**  Acquiring information and rules for using it.
* **Karoorsuu (Reasoning):** This is explicitly mentioned as a key ability of AI, alongside tasks like planning and problem-solving. The ability to reason is central to AI's capacity to go beyond simple programming and tackle complex problems.
* **Saganteessuu (Problem-solving):**  This is directly stated, and reasoning is a crucial component of effective problem-solving.
* **Hojiin teeknolojiin akka hojjatamu gochuu (Executing technological tasks):** This is a more general description of what AI *does*, but doesn't capture the core *capability* being discussed in terms of its underlying mechanism.



The text emphasizes that AI's potential lies in its ability to *reason* and solve problems, not just follow pre-programmed instructions.  Therefore, ""Saganteessuu"" is the most accurate answer to the question of AI's core mechanism as described in the text.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa AI wajjin yeroo heddu kan walilitti hidhamiinsa qabu kamiidha?","The correct answer is **B: Karoorsufi saganteessuu (Pattern Recognition and Sorting)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions ""Fakkeenyonni to’annaa, karoorsuu fi saganteessuu"" which translates to ""Examples include, recognizing patterns and sorting"". This is directly linked to the capabilities of AI systems described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Tajaajila maamilaa (Data processing):** While AI *does* involve data processing, the text highlights pattern recognition and sorting as specific and important applications. Data processing is a broader term.
*   **C: Asoosama saayinsii (Scientific discovery):** AI can *assist* in scientific discovery, but the passage focuses more on AI's ability to perform specific tasks like pattern recognition.
*   **D: Barreeffama harkaa hubachuu (Speech recognition):** Speech recognition is mentioned, but pattern recognition and sorting are given as more prominent examples of AI capabilities discussed in the passage.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that convergent thinking involves having ""patterns of mind"" that lead to a single correct solution.  Option D directly reflects this. Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Rakkoo tokkoof deebiwwan sirrii ta’an adda baasuu (Producing correct solutions for a single problem):** While convergent thinking *results* in correct solutions, it's not the defining characteristic *of the thinking pattern itself*. It's the outcome, not the process.
* **B: Rakkoo tokkoof maloota haaraa fayyadamuu (Using analogies for a single problem):**  Analogies can be a part of *both* convergent and divergent thinking, but it's not what makes a pattern of convergent thinking.
* **C: Rakkoolee furuuf yeroo fudhatanii hojjachuu (Working on problems within a time frame):** Time constraints can influence problem-solving, but they aren't core to the pattern of convergent thinking.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines convergent thinking as focusing on finding *one* correct answer.** Option A directly reflects this definition. If someone believes only one answer exists, they are engaging in convergent thinking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yeroo nama biraa fudhachuu (Listening to another person):**  Listening to others is crucial for exploring different perspectives and is *not* inherently convergent thinking. In fact, it can *lead* to more divergent thinking.
* **C: Odeeffannoo dhugaa gargar baasuu (Removing true information):** This is counterproductive to problem-solving and is not a characteristic of convergent thinking.
* **D: Odeeffannoo sassaabuu (Analyzing information):** Analysis is a key part of *both* convergent and divergent thinking. It's not specific to one or the other.

Therefore, option A is the only option that aligns with the passage's definition of convergent thinking.

Here's why:

The passage describes micro-expressions as fleeting facial expressions lasting milliseconds that reveal hidden emotions. Looking away while speaking is *not* a micro-expression. It can indicate nervousness, discomfort, or other things, but it's not the rapid, involuntary facial flicker characteristic of a micro-expression.

The other options are potentially micro-expressions:

* **B: Nyaara guuruu (Squinting eyes):** Can indicate suspicion, skepticism, or other emotions.
* **C: Dafanii ija libsachuu (Blinking eyes rapidly):** Can be a sign of stress, anxiety, or deception.

This translates to: ""Recently, it is claimed that a person can reveal their secret being through a small flicker in a video. Oliver Saaksi, in his role as Chief of Staff, showed that people cannot understand what he says because if he is injured, the secret becomes known.""
* The passage connects the ""small flicker"" to the possibility of revealing a secret.  A flicker in the video screen is a visual manifestation of this ""small flicker.""
* Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:
    * **B: Hiikni sirriin soba adda baasuu mala (The flicker can reveal a secret):** While the passage suggests this is *claimed*, it doesn't definitively state that a flicker *always* reveals a secret.
    * **C: Haasan akkasumas mallattoon fuulaa hiika qaba (The smile also has a facial expression):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
    * **D: Dhugummaa adda baasuf gargaaruu ni danda’a (Can help reveal the truth):** The passage focuses on revealing secrets, not necessarily the truth.

Therefore, **none of the answer choices (A, B, C, or D) can be directly supported by the provided text.** The question is unrelated to the text.

However, if we *assume* the question intends to ask which of those options was a key characteristic or contribution of the Renaissance, then the best answer would be **C: Ergaa gabaabaa yaadachuu (Considering the human being)**.

Here's why:

* **The Renaissance was fundamentally about a renewed interest in classical art, literature, and philosophy, with a strong emphasis on humanism.** Humanism shifted focus from solely religious matters to the potential and accomplishments of human beings. This included a greater emphasis on individual potential, reason, and observation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Dhuunfan waa yaadachuu (Thinking about things):** While important, this is too general. The Renaissance's unique contribution was the *focus* of thought.
* **B: Beekumsa daddabarsuu (Accumulating knowledge):**  Knowledge accumulation was present before the Renaissance, although the Renaissance prioritized *applying* knowledge in new ways.
* **D: Odeeffannoo argachuu (Obtaining information):** Information gathering happened before the Renaissance. The Renaissance's focus was more on *interpreting* and *applying* information.

**Therefore, if forced to choose based on a presumed connection to the Renaissance, C is the closest answer, although the connection is not evident in the provided text.**



**Important Note:** The question is flawed because the text provided is entirely irrelevant to the question being asked. I'm providing the best possible answer *given the assumption* that there's a connection to the Renaissance, but it's based on external knowledge, not the provided text.

Sababa Renesansiitin kanneen armaan gadii keessaa xiyyeeffannoo xiqqaan kan kennameef kamiidha?,"The answer is **C: Ergaa gabaabaa yaadachuu (Humanism)**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes the Renaissance as a period where individuals rediscovered and expanded their knowledge, moving beyond religious dogma and focusing on human potential.**  This aligns directly with the core principle of Humanism.  Humanism emphasized the study of classical literature, rhetoric, history, and moral philosophy – all things that focus on human capabilities and achievements.
* **The question asks *why* the Renaissance focused on these things.** Humanism provided the philosophical framework.  The shift in focus from solely religious concerns to human-centered pursuits fueled the intellectual and artistic flourishing of the Renaissance.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as accurate:

* **A: Dhuunfan waa yaadachuu (Thinking about God):** While religion remained important, the Renaissance shifted the *focus* away from solely religious thought towards human concerns.
* **B: Beekumsa argachuu (Acquiring knowledge):**  Acquiring knowledge was certainly a part of the Renaissance, but Humanism provided the *motivation* and *direction* for that knowledge acquisition – a focus on *human* knowledge and potential.
* **D: Tatamsa’ina odeeffannoo (Analyzing information):** Analyzing information was a developing skill, but it wasn't the primary driver of the Renaissance's intellectual shift. Humanism created the *information* that needed to be analyzed.



Therefore, **Humanism (Ergaa gabaabaa yaadachuu)** is the best answer because it encapsulates the intellectual and philosophical shift that fueled the Renaissance's focus on human potential and achievement.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa walitti dhufeenya itti fufiinsa qabuuf kaayyoo intarneetii fayyadamuu kan hin ibsine kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **D: Namoota haaraa qunnamuu (Connecting with new people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that elements of the internet can ""hangaa fi hariiroo waliiniin qaban wal qabsiise"" (connect with each other) and that internet use can lead to ""hariiroo walitti fufiinsaa"" (social interaction).  It also mentions email and Moodle (a learning platform) being innovations that sparked this interaction.  The example of ""barachuu"" (creating) and ""hawaasomsuun"" (communicating) being considered significant benefits of internet use reinforces the idea of connecting with others.

Option D, ""Namoota haaraa qunnamuu"" (Connecting with new people), directly aligns with this emphasis on interaction and forming relationships.  The other options are less directly supported by the passage:

*   **A: Walitti-hidhamiinsa daldalaaf (For collaborative work):** While collaboration *can* occur online, it's not the primary focus of the passage.
*   **B: Maatii wajjin wal-qunnamuu (Connecting with family):**  Family connection is a valid use, but the passage emphasizes broader social connection.
*   **C: Deemsa qorachuu (For learning):** Learning is mentioned (with Moodle), but the core argument is about *social* connection facilitated by the internet.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa hirmaannaa dhuunfaf kaayyoo intarneetii fayyadamuu kan hin ibsine kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Qajeelfama akkaataa itti waa hojjatan ilaaluu (Learning how to do things)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that internet elements can be used to ""conduct research and engage in collaborative activities."" It specifically mentions ""searching"" and ""communicating"" as ways the internet can be a valuable tool for gaining knowledge and achieving goals.  Learning how to do things (research, problem-solving) directly aligns with this idea of using the internet for valuable activities and achieving goals.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Boordii marii onlaayinii irratti maxxansuu (Posting on online bulletin boards):** While posting is a *type* of activity, it's not the core purpose highlighted in the passage.  The passage emphasizes knowledge acquisition and collaboration more than simple posting.
* **C: Meeshaalee waldhaansa fayyaa qorachuu (Learning health-related tools):** This is a specific application, not the general purpose of internet use as described.
* **D: Faayinaansiwwan bulchuu (Making financial transactions):**  Again, this is a specific application, not the overarching purpose.



Therefore, **A** best captures the general purpose of using the internet for valuable and goal-oriented activities, as discussed in the passage.

Awuwrooppan lixaa yoom warra dhiibbaa godhan irratti hirkachuu dhiisun adeemsa mataasaa tolfachuu eegale?,"The correct answer is **C: Bara Giddu Galeessaa booda naannoo waggaa 25**.

The text states: ""sababa chaanaalota walquunnamtii harkifataa irraa kan ka’e, haalonni dhiya keessaa waggoota 25 hang 30f duubatti hafuu danda’a."" which translates to ""due to the channels of communication, the ideas spread within 25 to 30 years.""  This directly indicates that it took 25-30 years *after* the Middle Ages for the Gothic style to become popular in Western Europe.
"
Batanii fayyadamuun wayyaa cufachuun maalirraa kan ka’eedha? ,"The correct answer is **C: Kiruseediwwan (Christianity)**.

The passage states: ""Guddina cimaa yeroo Sanaa sababa kiiruseedin namootni uffata safiisaf ta’uu uffachu jalqaban."" This translates to ""The great progress at that time began because Christians started to build cathedrals to glorify God."" 

Therefore, the rise of Christianity was the reason for the architectural advancements during the Gothic period.

"Akkaataa kutichaattit, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa rakkoo naannotiif furmaata yeroo dheeraa ta’ee kan fudhatamu kamiidha?","The correct answer is **C: Sababa rakkinichaa adda baasuu (Addressing the root cause of the problem)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that simply addressing the symptoms (a quick fix) isn't enough. It highlights that many regional issues are interconnected and have long-term consequences if not tackled at their core. The text also points to the significant changes brought about by science and technology, alongside increased environmental problems.  Therefore, focusing on the *root cause* of the problems is the most effective and sustainable solution.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Jireenya baasii guddaa qabu (extravagant lifestyle) qabu dhiisuu (Giving up an extravagant lifestyle):** While this *could* be a contributing factor to *some* problems, it's not a universal solution to *all* regional issues.
*   **B: Aktivistummaa (Activism):** Activism can be a *method* of addressing problems, but it's not the solution itself. It's a way to raise awareness and advocate for change.
*   **D: Michuu sochii kunuunsa naannoo ta’uu (This movement being a regional action):**  Being a regional action is a characteristic of the movement, not a solution to the underlying problems.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, haalota armaan gadii keessaa mala mallattoodhan rakkoo naannoo furuutti kan hin ilaalamne kami?","The correct answer is **B: Rakkoolef sababa ijoo kan ta’e hambisuu (Addressing problems and the root causes)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the interconnectedness of regional issues and the need for comprehensive solutions that address the underlying causes, not just the symptoms. Option B directly reflects this:

* **""Rakkoolef sababa ijoo kan ta’e hambisuu""** translates to ""Addressing problems and the root causes."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's argument that surface-level solutions won't work and we need to tackle the core issues to avoid further damage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Hojii aktivizimii keessatti hirmaachuu (Participating in activism):** While activism *can* be part of a solution, the passage goes beyond simple activism. It stresses a deeper understanding and addressing of root causes.
* **C: Waa’ee jireenya qaalii ta’e jiraachuu yaada dhiyeessuu (Abandoning a wasteful lifestyle):**  This is a valid point, but it's more of a personal responsibility and not the core regional problem the passage focuses on.  The passage implies structural issues are at play.
* **D: Jireenya naannof mijataa ta’e jiraachuu (Living a sustainable lifestyle):**  Similar to C, this is a positive goal, but it doesn't address the systemic problems and root causes the passage emphasizes.



Therefore, **B** is the best option because it directly reflects the passage's central argument about the necessity of addressing the root causes of regional problems.



"
Waraanni jalqabaa kaayyonsaa dhimma aangoo malee dhimma amantii hin taane Awurooppaa biyya kam keessatti ture?,"The correct answer is **D: Ispeen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lolli Dhaaltummmaa Ispeenotaa yeroo jalqabaaf kan galma ga’e dhimma giddu galaa aangoo ittiin madaalchisuuti."" This translates to ""The rise of Spanish colonialism was the first to emerge as a conflict over the balance of power.""  It explicitly links Spanish colonialism to a power struggle, not religious motivations. The text further explains that this shift in focus to power struggles caused European nations to abandon religious wars. 

While other European nations like England, Germany, and Portugal were also involved in colonialism, the text specifically identifies Spain's colonialism as the *first* to be driven by a conflict over power, differentiating it from the religious motivations of other colonial ventures. Therefore, Spain is the best answer based on the information provided.
"
Yeroo tokko tokko “waraana amantii” isa dhumaa jedhamee kan ibsamu waranaa kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Waraana Waggaa Soddomaa**.

The text explicitly states: ""humnoonni Awuroppa amma booda waraana amantaa kaasuuf jecha-duraa hin qaban. kanaaf, Waraanni Waggaa Soddomaa waraana amantaa isaa dhumaa kan jedhamu ta’a."" which translates to: ""European powers from now on had no hesitation to wage a war of religion. For this reason, the War of Sodom's People is considered their final war of faith.""
"
Amaloota (aspects) Waldaa Kaatoliikii armaan gadii keessaa kan adda bahaa hin turre kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Qoodinsi qabeenyaa Waldattii keessatti sirrii yoo hin turre (The management of the Catholic Church's wealth was not correct).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ejennoon Kiristaanummaa keessatti beekamu tokonee, qabeenyi gidiraa nama irraa furuufi, hiyyummaa nama irraa kaasuuf fayyadamamuu akka qabuufi, qarshiin funaanamu addatti kanuma kan bu'uureffateedha. Taayitaan giddu galeessa mana amantaa waggoota kumaa oliif Rroom ture kanaf walitti qabamni taayitaa fi qarshii baayyeen isaanii dambiin kun eegamuuf dhiisuu isa akka shakkan taasiseera.""  This translates to: ""One thing known about Christianity is that wealth should be used to free people from poverty and to remove suffering from people, and that disposable money should be used for good purposes. Therefore, a consensus was reached that the wealth and abundant money of this central institution, which has been in Rome for over a thousand years, should be given up as a sacrifice for this sin.""

This clearly indicates a problem with how the Catholic Church was managing its wealth – it wasn't being used in the way it *should* have been (to alleviate poverty and suffering) and was associated with ""sin.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Bu’uurriwwan amantichaa jijjiiramuu qaba yoo ta’e (Religious doctrines needed to be altered):** The passage doesn't mention any issues with the core religious doctrines.
* **C: Waldattii keessatti aangon qaama tokko harkatti baay’achuu (The concentration of power in the Church):** While the Church *did* have significant power, the passage's focus is specifically on the *management of wealth*, not the concentration of power.
* **D: Bu’uurriwwan ijoo waldattii guutamaa ture yoo ta’e (The Church's rituals were too elaborate):** The passage doesn't comment on the elaborateness of rituals.



Therefore, the management of the Church's wealth is the main issue highlighted in the passage."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Versaayilasitti kan ajjeefame eenyu ture?","The correct answer is **D: Eegduu (The mob)**.

The passage states: ""Bakka ta’ee tokko irratti miseensi mobicha eegdu sooreesicha du’eeti harkaa kaase ture kan Versayileesiti giftii aarte fuulduraati du’ee."" This translates to ""In one place, the mob's fervent assembly broke through the gates of Versailles and stormed the palace.""  Therefore, the mob is what ultimately caused the removal of the royal family from Versailles.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa kan Mooticha ykn Giiftittii irratti garee hokkaraan (the mob) irratti hin fe’amne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Banamuu foddaa konkolaataa isaanii.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the mob *demanded* the King and Queen to disband their royal guard (foddaa konkolaataa isaanii bal'isanii akka bananiif dirqisiisan).  This is the action they took that the King and Queen could not withstand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Versaayilas keessaa tasa bahuu:** The passage says they *did* return to Paris. It was the mob's actions *in* Paris that became overwhelming.
*   **C: Eegdun yeroo fannifamu ilaaluu:** Watching the mob was something they likely did, but it wasn't the core issue that the mob was protesting.
*   **D: Deemsa gara Paarisitti deebi’uu:**  Returning to Paris was their action, not something the mob was protesting. The problem was *how* they returned and the symbols of their power they carried.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa bu’aa waraana galaanarraa Biriiteen kan idilee hin taanee kan hin turre kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Fedhii Jarman tooftaa waraanaa wal-fakkaataa fayyadamuu barbaaduu (Germany's desire to use a collective security system)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Britain wanted to ""hambisuf"" (prevent) any power from dominating the world, fearing a catastrophic war. This implies a desire for a collective security system to prevent such domination. Germany, however, lacked the willingness to participate in such a system. The text explicitly says, ""Jarmaniinis lola bishaan jalaa daangaa hinqabneef deebii walfakkataa eegde"" (Germany did not have the will to join a collective security system, so it responded with a collective agreement).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dooniwwan hin hirmaanne bifa miidhamaniin kaa’aman (Nations were placed in a neutral way):** The text doesn't focus on the neutrality of nations but on the desire for collective security.
*   **C: Seera idil-addunyaarratti jijjiiramatu ta’ee ture (The international law did not change):** The text highlights the change in approach, with Britain actively seeking to create a new security system.
*   **D: Dhiyeessiwwan bu’uuraa argachuun rakkisaa ture (Peaceful resolutions were difficult to achieve):** The text doesn't focus on the difficulty of peaceful resolutions. It focuses on the efforts to prevent war through collective security.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa humni galaanaa Biriiteen Jarmanitti karaa cufuu sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Dooniwwan keessaa hin qabne ykn hin hirmaanne akka hin miidhamne mirkaneesse** (They pretended not to desire or participate in the war to avoid being harmed).

Here's why:

The passage states that Britain, despite wanting to prevent Germany from dominating the world, ""had no desire for knowledge and feared disaster.""  Therefore, they strategically concealed their intentions and pretended to be uninvolved in the war, hoping to avoid being caught in the crossfire.  This is described as a ""secret plan"" (""karaa cufuu sirriitti"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Faallaa seera idil-addunyaa ture** (It was a violation of the peace treaty) - While Britain's actions *were* arguably a violation of the underlying principles of peace, the passage focuses on *how* they concealed their intentions, not whether it broke a treaty.
*   **B: Lola doonii waraanaa galaana jalaa Jarman akka eegalu godhe** (They wanted Germany to dominate the world) - The passage explicitly says Britain *didn't* desire world dominance; they feared it.
*   **C: Daandii dhiyeessii Jarman jalaa danqe** (They took action against the German offensive) - The passage emphasizes their *concealment* of action, not taking action.

Therefore, option D best captures the essence of the passage's explanation of Britain's strategy."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, qorannoon rakkoo dugdaafi sammuu (Multiple Sclerosis) eenyuf gorfama?","The correct answer is **C: Dhiira waggaa 43**.

The text states: ""Akka qorannoon mul’isuutti shamarran MS qabaachuudhaan dachaa lama dhiiraa ta’u."" This translates to: ""According to studies, men are twice as likely to have MS.""

Therefore, a man aged 43 fits the profile of someone more likely to have MS based on this information.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, hirmaattonni hojii idilee keessa jiran maalif deeggarsa dabalataa barbaadu?","The correct answer is **D: Sodaa (Support)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Warreen gocha idilee kessatti hirmaatan gargarsaa bay’ee barbaadu akkaataa hubbannoo cimina dhukkubbii irratti hundaa’uudhaan, garaagarummaa dhukkubbii yeroo dheeraa fi miijachuu dhabuu sochii qaamaa gidduu jiru adda baasuuf.""

This translates to: ""People who participate in community activities seek a lot of support, with the understanding that this helps to reduce the duration of suffering and to overcome the physical activity gap caused by chronic illness.""

Therefore, the text explicitly says that people participating in community activities want a lot of *support*.  The other options are not mentioned as the primary reason they seek this support.
"
"Akaataa kutichaatti, taphni billaa (fencing) yeroo heddu akkamitti taphatama?","The correct answer is **C: sadarkaa Olompikiitti**.

Here's why:

The passage states that athletes in sports are trained from the grassroots level to reach the Olympic level. Fencing, as mentioned in the question, is a sport where one person uses a blade to fight another.  Therefore, the training ultimately aims for the Olympic level. The other options are too narrow; while fencing might start at the grassroots level (A) and could be practiced at the university level (B), the ultimate goal mentioned in the passage is the Olympics (C). Option D (Bifa lolaan - in a fighting manner) describes the *nature* of fencing, not the training progression.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa agarsiistuu cimaa summaa’uu keessoo kan ta’e kami?","The correct answer is **A: Haqqee fi qaama gubaa (Blood and pus)**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Wanti gaariin Summa’uu keessoo agarsiisu tarii jiraachuu qola qorichaa banaa yookaan keemikaalota macheeessoo mana keessaati"" which translates to ""Signs of suppuration (infection) are characterized by redness of the skin or household chemicals"".  Redness (Haqqee) and pus (Qaama gubaa) are classic signs of infection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ol-deebisuufi dafqisiisuu (Swelling and heat):** While swelling and heat *can* be associated with infection, the text specifically mentions redness and pus as immediate signs.
* **C: Maashan garmalee walitti goguu fi dhukkubbii garaa (Severe pain and general discomfort):** These are symptoms that *might* accompany a severe infection, but the text focuses on visible signs.
* **D: Qaruura qorichaa ajaja ogeessaa qabdu (The doctor needs to immediately have a biopsy of the wound):**  While a biopsy *might* be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, the text describes observable signs first and recommends seeking initial medical advice.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo dhukkubsataa ykn nama miidhame qoratan waanti murteessan jalqaba godhamuu qabu maali?","The correct answer is **A: Naannicha ilaali (Listen to their story)**.

Here's why:

The initial paragraph emphasizes the importance of listening to the person who has been harmed. It highlights that even if you offer advice, simply forcing your perspective won't help.  The question asks what to do *immediately* when someone tells you something painful or has been harmed. 

Listening to their story is the most crucial first step. It allows them to express themselves, feel heard, and begin the process of processing what happened. The other options are important, but they come *after* listening:

* **B: Nama miidhame sanatti dhiyaadhu (Empathize with the person who was harmed)** - Empathy comes *after* you've heard their story.
* **C: Namni miidhame kallattii inni itti ciisu hubadhu (Understand what the person who was harmed wants)** - Understanding their desires takes time and further conversation *after* they've shared their experience.
* **D: Deeggarsa eegi (Give advice)** -  The initial paragraph warns *against* rushing to give advice. It suggests it might not be helpful if offered too soon.



Therefore, listening is the foundational and most important initial response.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa adeemsa nama miidhame ilaaluu sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Alaaban ykn mallattoon diiman jiraachuu adda baasi (A sign or symptom of a lack of respect is present)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that a lack of respect isn't just about harsh words. It's also reflected in actions and signs.** The passage mentions ""alaabaa diimaa ofiin of too’atu kamuu"" which translates to ""any sign of disrespect to oneself.""  This aligns directly with option D.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Nan miidham jettee hin yaadda’in (I don't think I've been disrespected):**  This is a denial and doesn't address how disrespect *might* be shown.
* **B: Nama miidhame dura naannoo ilaali (Look at the person before they disrespect you):** This is about preventative measures and doesn't connect to recognizing disrespect *after* it happens.
* **C: Namni miidhame kallattii inni itti ciisu ilaali (Look at the person's past to see if they've been disrespectful before):** This focuses on history, not the immediate signs of disrespect.

Jijjiiramoota Warraaqsa Faransaayi keessaa lammiilee hojjattoota ta’an irratti dhiibbaa cimaa kan fide kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Xiyyeeffannoon murna (class) irraa gara wal-dorgommiitti jijjiiramuu** (Moving from class consciousness to class struggle).

Here's why:

The passage describes how the French Revolution, initially focused on the rights of the privileged classes, evolved to emphasize the needs and aspirations of the common people. It mentions that the revolution encouraged people in other countries to emulate their example.  This shift from focusing on class distinctions to a broader sense of national unity and shared goals is a core tenet of revolutionary movements.  The passage highlights a change in focus from the needs of the elite to the general needs of the population.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Biyyattiif deeggarsi dabaluu** (Establishing a state for the nation): While a state is necessary, the passage focuses on the *change in the nature of the state's purpose* - from serving elites to serving the people.
* **C: Ilaalchi Rippaabilikaa fudhatamuu** (Acceptance of republican ideals):  The passage doesn't primarily focus on the acceptance of republicanism; it centers on the revolution's impact on the people's thinking.
* **D: Mala safaraa haaraa** (New travel routes): This is irrelevant to the themes of the passage.



Therefore, the shift from a focus on class consciousness to a movement promoting unity and common purpose is best represented by option B.



"
"Warraaqsa Faransaayi booda, waraanafi hojii biraan milkaa’un hamma tokko (less likely) maalirratti kan hundaa’edha?","The correct answer is **A: Milkaa’ina (Performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...sababniisas ramaddiin loltootaa sababa kutaa irratti hundaa’uuf dhiisee amma barbaachisummaa irratti waan hundaa’uuf.""  This translates to ""...because the passion of the revolutionaries was focused on factions, now it's focused on needs/necessities.""

The passage goes on to say that the French Revolution inspired other nations to start their own constitutions.  The emphasis is shifted *from* factionalism *to* fulfilling the needs of the people.  Therefore, the focus of subsequent revolutions and actions would be on *performance* - how well the government addresses the needs and problems of its citizens.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Sadarkaa (Rank/Status):** The passage doesn't highlight a shift in focus towards social rank or status.
*   **C: Fedhii (Power):** While power is always a factor, the passage specifically contrasts the focus on power dynamics (factions) with the focus on needs.
*   **D: Amala ykn qulqullina (Morality/Virtue):**  The passage is more focused on practical needs and fulfilling requirements, not on abstract concepts of morality or virtue.

Biyyoota guddatan keessatti tajaajila uummataa kamtu gammaduu dhabuu guddaadhaf sababa ta’a?,"The correct answer is **C: Geejjiba uummataa (Public healthcare)**.

The provided text discusses the issues surrounding the healthcare system, specifically mentioning:

*   The public's frustration with the healthcare system.
*   The lack of accessibility and quality of care.
*   The difficulties people face in getting necessary medical attention.

Therefore, the question asking what public service causes the most disappointment in major countries directly relates to the challenges outlined in the text concerning **public healthcare**. The other options (cleanliness, green spaces, education) are not the primary focus of the text's complaints."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee maloota geejjiba uummataa maaltu jedhamuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **C: Namoonni baay'en isaan fayyafaman akka komii kaasaniif sabab (People are often motivated to donate because of the impact they see)**.

Here's why:

The question describes a situation where people are donating to disaster relief efforts, highlighting the significant need and the impact of donations. The question then asks *why* people continue to donate even if the relief efforts seem ineffective or if there are questions about the efficiency of the aid.

Option C directly addresses this motivation. People donate because they *see* the suffering and want to help those affected. This empathy and desire to alleviate suffering are strong drivers of charitable giving, even when there are concerns about how the aid is distributed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Namoota fayyadaman hundaan baay'ee jaalatamu (Those who are benefited are very loved):** While those affected are deserving of love and support, this doesn't explain *why* people continue to donate despite potential issues with aid distribution.
*   **B: Akka qulqullina bishaanii badaa miti (The radiance of the moon is not bad):** This is irrelevant to the question about disaster relief and donation motivations.
*   **D: Biyyoota guddu keessatti bilisa (Known in many big countries):**  This is about the reach of the aid efforts, not the motivation for people to donate.



Therefore, option C is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, sababa konkolaachistoota tilmaamun rakkisaa ta’eef kanneen armaan gadii keessaa safaruuf rakkisaa kan ta’u kamiidha?","The correct answer is **A: Saffisa tiraafikaa (Traffic speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amaloota ijoo sadeen irratti walitti dhuufeenyi dhaabamee jira: (1) ya'iinsa, (2) heddumminaa, fi (3) saffisa.""  This translates to: ""Three aspects have been studied: (1) congestion, (2) volume, and (3) speed.""

The question asks which of the options is *most* difficult to overcome due to traffic congestion.  While all three aspects (congestion, volume, and speed) are problems, the passage emphasizes that traffic *speed* is a significant contributor to driver frustration. The options provided relate to addressing these aspects.  Therefore, *speed* is the most directly related to the driver's negative experience caused by congestion, making it the most difficult to overcome.

The other options are related but not the *most* directly linked to the problem described:

* **B: Karoora daandii baasuu (Road construction plan):**  Important for long-term solutions, but doesn't directly address the immediate problem of frustrated drivers.
* **C: Hojii daandii (Road work):**  Road work can cause congestion, but it's a *result* of other issues, not the primary cause of driver frustration.
* **D: Toora Tiraafikaa (Traffic network):**  A broader concept, not specifically related to the difficulty of overcoming driver frustration due to speed.

The text states that traffic data analysis helps in planning, design, and **road design**.  The question asks which option benefits from stream data analysis. Road design is directly influenced by understanding traffic patterns (volume, speed, and frequency of vehicles), which is what stream data analysis provides.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Hojii daandii (Roadwork):** While traffic data *can* inform roadwork, it's not the primary benefit. Roadwork is a *result* of planning and design, not the thing that directly benefits from the stream data analysis.
*   **B: Amala konkolaachisaa (Driving behavior):**  Driving behavior is *influenced* by traffic conditions but isn't the direct beneficiary of the data analysis itself. The data analysis is used to understand the conditions that *cause* driving behaviors.
*   **D: Rukkina tiraafikaa (Traffic monitoring):** Traffic monitoring *collects* the data, but the analysis of that data leads to other benefits like road design."
Hersheyfi Chase Qaccee Sanyii (DNA) isaanii dhaabuf maal fayyadaman? ,"The correct answer is **C: Reediyoo aktivii salfarii (Radioactive sulfur)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isaan yaalii lama taasisan, yookaan DNA kan fosfaarasii irratti raadiyoo si’aata ta’ee ykn gara pirootinii kan raadiyoo si’aataa salfarii ta’eetti mallattoo gochuun."" This translates to: ""They established two experiments, either labeling the DNA with radioactive phosphorus or labeling the protein with radioactive sulfur.""

The question asks what Hershey and Chase used to label the *protein*. The passage clearly states they used radioactive sulfur to label the protein.

Dandeettin jijjiiramuu (mutation) gara ilmootti darbuuf maal irratti hirkata?,"The correct answer is **A: Seelonni kan jarmii seelota duraanii irraa uumaman yoo ta’an** (Mutations that arise from the previous cell's dying cells).

Here's why:

The text states that mutations in stem cells (seeloota duraanii) can lead to cancerous growth. It also mentions that only mutations in stem cells that cause dying cells can pass on to offspring. This implies that the origin of the mutation – stemming from dying cells – is key to whether it can be passed down.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Barbaachisummaa wantota uumamaa ta’anii** (The variability of creating things): While variability is related to mutations, it doesn't directly address *what* allows a mutation to be passed on.
*   **C: Gosa jijjiirama (mutation type)** (Mutation type): The type of mutation itself isn't the primary factor determining heritability.
*   **D: Jijjiirama yoo seelin akka du’u godhe** (Mutation if it makes the cell die): This is a consequence of *some* mutations, but not the defining factor for whether it's heritable. The text emphasizes the origin of the mutation (dying cells).



Therefore, option A is the most accurate based on the provided text."
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, jijjiiramni garaa garaa kan irratti hin hundoofne maalidha?","The correct answer is **C: Barbaachisummaa wantoota genetikii miidhamanii** (The randomness of mutated genetic material).

Here's why:

The text states that mutations in somatic cells (non-reproductive cells) can lead to cancer or cell death, but *only* mutations in germline cells (reproductive cells) are heritable. This implies that the *randomness* of mutations in germline cells is what makes them passed down to offspring. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Wantoota genetikii hagamtu miidhame (Mutated genetic material that has been fixed):** While mutations are part of genetic material, the text emphasizes the *randomness* and heritability of those mutations, not their fixed nature.
* **B: Seelonni miidhaman kan jarmii seelota duraanii irraa uumaman yoo ta’an (Mutated cells that originated from somatic cells):**  The text *contrasts* somatic mutations with germline mutations. It's the germline mutations that are heritable.
* **D: Gosa jijjiirama miidhamee (A lineage of mutated cells):** While mutations can create lineages, the core concept the text highlights is the randomness of mutations that become heritable.



Therefore, the randomness of mutations in germline cells is the key element that explains why they are passed down to future generations.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa aadawwan durii sababa re’ee tursiisaniif kan hin turre kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Lafa akka dheedan gargaari (To help with the transportation of bodies)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in the past, people would take the bodies of their loved ones to higher places or mountains, often with children or young men who were close to them. This suggests they needed help transporting the bodies.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Foon akka argamu godhu (To get a phone)** - The passage focuses on the transportation of bodies and not the acquisition of phones.
*   **C: Hiriyaa namaaf ta’u (To be someone's companion/friend)** - While companionship might have been a comfort, the primary reason for the action described was the physical act of taking the body.
*   **D: Annan namaaf kennu (To give to another person)** - This doesn't align with the core reason of assisting in the transportation of a body.



"
Kaayyon golfii waanta xiqqaa hammamii fudhachuudha?,"The correct answer is **B: Istookiwwan (Strokes)**.

The text states: ""Taphataan istirookii tiqqoo fudhatu yookaaan diree waliin-gahuuf xiqqeenyaan kilabii naannessu ni mo’ata."" This translates to: ""A stroke is a small movement to hit the ball or to play a chip.""

Therefore, a stroke is the smallest unit of counting in golf.
"
Tapha golfii keessatti margi kan gabaabbatu eessatti?,"The correct answer is **B: Bakka magariisatti**.

The passage states: ""Taphichi marga irratti kan taphatamuufi margi naannoo boollaa jiru kan gabaabsamee haamame magariisa jedhama."" This translates to: ""The place where the golf club strikes the ball on the ground is called the lie."" Therefore, the golf club strikes the ball at the **lie**.
"
Kaayyon qorannoo inni ijoon kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Addunyaan akkaataa itti hojjattu baruuf (To understand how the world works)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientific inquiry aims to understand how the world works. It mentions using observation, experimentation, and questioning to achieve this understanding. Option B directly reflects this central goal.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Yaadota (hypotheses) tokko ykn lama balleessuuf (To disprove one or two hypotheses):** While disproving hypotheses is *part* of the scientific process, it's not the overarching goal. The goal is broader than just hypothesis testing.
*   **C: Gaaffii dhiyeessuf (To ask questions):** Asking questions is a *method* used in scientific inquiry, but it doesn't encompass the entire aim.
*   **D: Qorannoo saayinsaawaa gaggeessuf (To conduct scientific research):** Conducting research is a *means* to an end, not the end itself. The end is understanding.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, qorannoo saayinsaawaa gaggeessuf kan hin gargaarre maalidha?","The correct answer is **B: Ilaaluu (Observation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientific inquiry utilizes methods like observation, experimentation, hypothesis testing, questioning, and critical thinking.  While the other options might be *part* of a scientific process, observation is explicitly mentioned as a key component *and* is a fundamental starting point.

* **A: Mala saayinsaawaa qofaa (The scientific method alone)** - The passage says more than just the scientific method is used; it also mentions other skills like questioning and critical thinking.
* **C: Yaadota jiraachuu malan balleessuu (Eliminating false ideas)** -  While crucial for refining hypotheses, it's not a foundational step in *conducting* a scientific inquiry.
* **D: Qorannoo gaggeessuu (Conducting experiments)** - Experiments are a method used within scientific inquiry, but not the overarching element that makes the process happen.

Therefore, **observation** is the most accurate answer based on the passage.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee torneedoo himni sirrii hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **A: Torneedon waan bakkicha jiru hunda balleessuu danda’a**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Tornadoon bubbeewwan jeeqoo biroo waliin yommuu madaalamtu bakka xiqqoo qabatu, garuu wanta daandii isaanirra jiran hunda barbadeesu."" (When tornadoes travel with severe thunderstorms and cover a small area, they destroy everything in their path.)
* **Option A directly reflects this:** ""Torneedon waan bakkicha jiru hunda balleessuu danda’a"" (A tornado can destroy everything in its path).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Torneedon akka bubbee hamaa osoo hin taane naannoo muraasa miidha** (Tornadoes only damage a few areas as a severe storm) - The text clearly states they destroy *everything* in their path, not just a few areas.
* **C: Torneedowwan harki caalan sa’aatii sadii ol turu** (Tornadoes can last more than three hours) - The text says tornadoes typically last *about* three hours.  While they *can* last longer, the text doesn't state that they *always* last more than three hours.
* **D: Torneedowwan tokko tokko bubbee saa’aatitti maayilii hanga 300 deemuu qabaachuu danda’a** (Individual tornadoes can travel up to 300 miles in an hour) - The text states the wind speed can be up to 300 mph, not how far the tornado can travel in an hour.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, himoota armaan gadii keessaa torneedowwan harka caalu sirriitti kan ibsu kamiidha?","The correct answer is **A: Yeroo heddu sa’aatii sadii ol turu** (Usually lasts more than four hours).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tornadoon hamman kan parsantii lamaa ta’uu sa’aatii sadiif tura.""  This translates to ""A tornado usually lasts for more than four hours.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bubbee sa’aatitti naannoo maayilii 480 deemuu danda’u uumu** (Can create a region that can travel 480 miles per hour in an hour) - While the wind speed can be high (480 km/h), this option focuses on speed rather than duration.
* **C: Bubbeewwan kaan caalaa naannoo heddu miidhu** (Can cover a much larger area than the previous ones) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the area covered.
* **D: Muka hundeen buqqisuuf dandeettii qaba** (Has the ability to break all the trees) - The passage mentions trees being broken, but doesn't state it can break *all* trees.

Therefore, the most accurate statement based on the passage is that tornadoes typically last for more than four hours.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa ilmi namaa jaarraa 16ffaa keessa hojjachuu kan eegale kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **D: Telekoppiiwwan omishuu** (Telescopes that magnify).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that telescopes, developed in 16th-century Europe, used two lenses to magnify distant objects.
* The question asks what *enabled* people in the 16th century to observe things more closely.
*  ""Telekoppiiwwan omishuu"" directly refers to the tool (telescopes) that provided the ability to magnify and thus observe things more closely.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Leensiiwwan fayyadamuu** (Using lenses): While lenses are *part* of a telescope, the question is about the overall device that allowed for magnification.
* **B: Wantota guddisuu** (Magnifying things): This is a description of what a telescope *does*, not what enabled observation in the 16th century.
* **C: Leensiiwwan omishuu** (Magnifying lenses):  This refers to magnifying lenses, but doesn't specify the tool that utilizes them - the telescope.



"
Dhalli namaa leensii fayyadamuun wantota guddisee ilaaluu hammiif gochaa ture?,"The correct answer is **D: Jalqaba jaarraa 16ffaa irraa eegalee**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Teeleskooppiiwwan warri dhugaan jalqabaa dhuma jaarraa 16ffaa keessa Awurooppaa keessatti hojjetaman.""  This translates to ""Refracting telescopes were first developed in Europe in the early 17th century.""

Therefore, the development of telescopes that allowed for seeing things much further away happened in the early 17th century.

"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, waa’ee shaakala amantii ykn duudhawwan isaa holqi Mohaammad maal jedha?","The correct answer is **D: Mul’achuufi dhagahamuuf sodaatee ture (He was eager to be seen and heard).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dhugaa dubbachuuf, tokko akka jiru yoo beekeyyuu, barbaadanima arguun salphaa miti, si’a tokko holqa sana seennaan gutuummaa guutuutti kophaatti adda baafamuudha. (To speak the truth, if someone knows he exists, he is not satisfied just to see him, until he completely exposes his sermon to the whole world.)""

This clearly indicates that Mohammed's motivation for his actions was to be seen, heard, and have his message spread widely. Options A, B, and C don't align with this stated desire.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ayiraniin yeroo jalqabaaf maalif hojiirra oole?","The correct answer is **C: Wiilii**.

The passage states: ""Suuta suuta yoo sibiila bixxilmaa aayiranii irratti daballe karaan gahumsa garii akka qabaatu beekame."" This translates to: ""When they added iron rims to the wheels, it became known that the cart had greater strength.""  Iron rims were a crucial part of the wheel design that allowed for better performance, and the ""wiilii"" is the Ethiopian word for wheel.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, gommaan mukaa kan ayiraniitin maalif bakka bu’ee ture?","The correct answer is **A: Dabaluu saffisa konkolaataa (Accelerate the speed of travel)**.

The text states: ""...karaa bu’aa ba’ii qabu kan duraanii caalaa fardeen isaan harkisan saffisa guddaadhaan ba’aawwan ulfaatoo harkisanii fiiguu isaan dandeessiseera."" This translates to: ""...the roads they paved with well-arranged stones enabled them to quickly transport goods and passengers.""

Therefore, the purpose of paving roads with stones was to **accelerate the speed of travel**.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bara Romaantisizimii namoota dhuunfaa maaltu yaadasaanii jijjiire?","The correct answer is **D: Aadaa (Customs/Traditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""customs of the Jalale"" (Jaalaleessuun qaama guddaa murteeffannaa aadaa qaba ture) were influential and followed by thinkers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schelling.  The passage then describes the Jalale's customs, mentioning a reverence for the earth and a belief in the connection between the earth and the souls of people. It also mentions a reverence for nature and laws like those established by Feete (likely referring to a specific cultural or religious tradition).

Therefore, the passage directly links a shift in the perception of ordinary people during the Romantic era to the customs and traditions of the Jalale.  The other options are not explicitly mentioned as the *reason* for the shift in perception. ""Seerota"" (Laws) and ""Haala teessuma lafaa"" (The state of the earth) are aspects *within* the Jalale's customs, not the cause of the shift in societal values. ""Barsiifata"" (Teaching/Education) is not mentioned at all.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the *interpretation* of technology rather than technology itself being inherently harmful.** It states that technology's impact on society isn't determined by its inherent nature, but by how society chooses to use and interpret it. 
* The example of the motorcycle illustrates this perfectly. The motorcycle itself isn't inherently dangerous, but its impact (positive or negative) depends on how it's used and regulated. 
* Option B directly reflects this idea that the ""harm"" of technology isn't built-in, but rather arises from societal choices and interpretations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhiibban teeknolojiin hawaasarratti qabu hawaasarratti kan hundaa’udha:** While societal choices are important, the passage argues that technology's impact isn't *inherently* determined by societal choices.
* **C: Teeknolojiin hawaasarratti dhiibbaa uumamaa (inherent effects) qaba:** This contradicts the core argument of the passage, which is that technology doesn't have inherent harmful effects.
* **D: Guddinii teknolojii dhiibbaa siyaasaa irratti hin hundaa’u:** The passage uses the example of motorcycle regulation to show how technology can have a political impact. 



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, xiyya harkisuu ( pulling the bow) wajjin kan walitti hin dhufne kamiidha?","The answer is **C: Sagalee jabaa (A thick string)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Laagaan irraa yeroo baayyee sagalee laafaa maddisiisa, garuu laagaan jalaa jabaa dhaa fi irra caala dheekkamsa kan qabudha."" This translates to: ""The bow often produces thin strings, but the bow should be thick and have a strong grip.""  Therefore, a thick string (""sagalee jabaa"") is *not* the characteristic of a properly tuned bow, and would be inconsistent with the described practice of pulling the bow.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

* **A: Sagalee tasgabbaa’aa (A thin string):** The text mentions thin strings as a *result* of the bow, not something it's inconsistent with when pulling it.
* **B: Mallattoo wal-qabsiistuu (staple) fakkaatu (Looks like a staple):** This describes the *appearance* of the bow, not its function. The text doesn't mention anything about its appearance resembling a staple.
* **D: Raachatti jalqabuu (Starting at the frog):**  This describes the *starting point* of the bow, which is a common and expected practice when pulling it. The text doesn't indicate it's inconsistent.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa sagalee jabaadhan kan wal qabatu kamiidha?","The correct answer is **A: Mallattoo fiixensaa lamaan gadi jallate** (Two fixed markings facing downwards).

Here's why:

The passage describes the following two markings:

*   **Gubba (Mouth):**  ""Gubba jechuun fixee irraa egaltee asii gadi beendoo dhiibu qabda."" (The mouth is like a fixed mark from the ""fixe"" and has a downward-pointing end.)
*   **Gajjellaa (Tongue):** ""Gajjellaa jechuun luqeettu kee irra egalte (iddo harki kee beendoo qabu) fi beendoo harkiisuudha."" (The tongue is like a fixed mark from your tongue (the downward-pointing end of your tongue) and is a downward-pointing end.)

Both the mouth and the tongue are described as having a downward-pointing end, which corresponds to two fixed markings facing downwards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Xiyya harkisuu** (The act of sticking out your tongue): This is an action, not a marking.
*   **C: Mallattoo V fakkaatu** (Marking that looks like a V): While the ""Gubba"" *can* resemble a V, it's not the primary or defining characteristic described in the passage.
*   **D: Bakka harki kee xiyya qabaterraa eegaluu** (The place where your tongue sticks out): This describes the position of the tongue, not the marking itself.



"
Waanti bososaan (fossils) akka agarsiisutti kanneen armaan gadii keessa yeroon booda harki maal hojjachuudhaf fayidaarra oole?,"The correct answer is **A: Waa hojjachuu (manipulation)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the development of the hand, with its opposable thumb and precise grip, allowed early hominins to ""use their hands to grasp and manipulate objects."" This is directly linked to the evolution of tools and other forms of interaction with the environment.
* The text also mentions that the hand of a human is different from a chimpanzee's, allowing for more precise manipulation.
* The other options are less directly supported by the text:
    * **B: Ba’aa baachuu (Gathering food):** While important, the text focuses on the *manipulation* aspect rather than simply gathering.
    * **C: Sochii (Walking):** The text mentions walking (harka sochii), but it's presented as a basic capability, not the key advancement highlighted.
    * **D: Quba dachaasanii lafa qabatanii deemuu (Carrying objects while walking):** This is a *result* of the ability to manipulate objects, not the primary skill itself.

Therefore, **Waa hojjachuu (manipulation)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa lafeewwan qubaa (phalanges) chimpaanzii kan sirriitti ibsu kami? ,"The correct answer is **A: Kan namaarra qajeeladha’ (They are more upright)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harki namaa miila caala gabaabaadha, lafee qubaa qajeelaa wajjiin."" This translates to ""Human feet are more upright, with a prominent heel bone.""

The question asks how the phalanges (toe bones) of chimpanzees differ from humans. The passage implies that the difference lies in the uprightness of the foot, and how the phalanges are configured to support that. Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Harkiifi miilli isaanii wal caala (Their feet and toes are similar):** The passage explicitly states they are *not* similar.
*   **C: Ulfaatina qaamaa baachuf gargaaru (Help in grasping):** While chimpanzee feet are good for grasping, the passage doesn't focus on that aspect in comparison to human feet.
*   **D: Jalqabatti Waa hojjachuuf gargaaru (Help in walking upright):** The passage implies that the upright foot structure is crucial for walking upright. Therefore, option D could be a valid answer, but option A is more precise and directly supported by the text. The key distinction highlighted is the *uprightness* which is directly related to the arrangement of the phalanges.



"
Filachuun toora qaccee sanyii (genetic variation) haaraa Puulii kam keessaa balleessa?,"The correct answer is **C: Adda baasuu (Selection)**.

Here's why:

The text states that natural selection, acting on variations in traits, is a key mechanism in the evolution of species.  

* **Natural selection (adda ba'iinsii)** favors individuals with traits that give them a survival and reproductive advantage.  Those individuals are more likely to pass on their genes, leading to changes in the population over time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhoksaa (Mutation):**  Mutations *create* variation, but they don't directly *eliminate* specific variations.  Selection acts *on* the existing variation.
* **B: Adeemsa qaccee sanyii organizimii garaa garaarraa walitti fiduu (Gene flow between populations):** Gene flow *introduces* new variations into populations, it doesn't eliminate existing ones.
* **D: Kan ibsame (What is being stated/described):** This is too broad. The text describes the general process of natural selection, not specifically what it eliminates.



Therefore, the text clearly points to **adda ba'iinsii (selection)** as the mechanism responsible for eliminating certain genetic variations and favoring others.



"
Toora qaccee sanyii dabaluuf adeemsa kamtu itti gaafatama?,"The correct answer is **C: Adda bahuu ykn Muteeshinii (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Qorannoon jaarraa digdammaffaa garaagarummaan eela sanyii darbuu bifa lamaan akka jiran ni mul'isa: dhokataa fi kan ibsamu.""  (Studies of the 20th century show that the genetic diversity of the cold adaptation occurs in two ways: through inheritance and through mutation.)

The question asks how a new genetic variation in cold adaptation is introduced. The text explicitly states that **mutation** is one of the ways.  Option C directly translates to ""Mutation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adda baasuu (Inheritance)** -  The text says inheritance is *one* way, but it's not the *introduction* of a new variation. It's passing on existing variations.
* **B: Adeemsa qaccee sanyii organizimii garaa garaarraa walitti fiduu (The process of cold adaptation of organisms interacting with each other)** - While interaction plays a role in adaptation, it's not the *mechanism* for introducing new genetic variations.
* **D: Kan ibsame (The one that is informed/recorded)** - This doesn't refer to a process of variation introduction.



Therefore, **C: Adda bahuu ykn Muteeshinii** is the accurate answer because the text directly links mutation to the creation of new genetic variations in cold adaptation.

"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessa jirurratti hundaa’un, “rakkoo pirotiinii” furuuf kanneen keessaa nyaata piraayimeetii ta’uu kan qabu kami?","The answer is **A: Baala mukaa du’e (Animal fat)**.

Here's why:

The text states that animals have difficulty obtaining the amino acids their bodies need because plant-based foods don't have a complete profile of protein and essential nutrients. It then clarifies that *animal products (meat, milk, eggs)* provide complete proteins containing all essential amino acids. 

Therefore, animal fat (and the meat, milk, and eggs that contain it) is the primary source of complete protein to solve the ""protein deficiency"" issue. The text emphasizes that it's a natural process for animals in the savanna to obtain protein this way.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, rakkoolee armaan gadii keessaa hanqina amiinoo asiidiwwan murteessoo ta’aniin kan hin uumamne kami?","The correct answer is **C: Guddina jijjiirama hin qabne (Lack of growth)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the difficulty in obtaining amino acids leads to problems like:

*   **Guddachu dadhabuu (Lack of growth)**
*   Haala nyaata sirna hin qabne (Lack of a proper food source)
*   Du’aa (Dehydration)

Therefore, lack of growth is directly mentioned as a consequence of amino acid deficiency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rakkoolee soorata daakuu (Lack of muscle mass):** While amino acids are important for muscle mass, the text focuses on the general lack of growth as a primary problem.
*   **B: Hanqina nyaataa (Food scarcity):** Food scarcity is a contributing factor, but the core issue discussed is the lack of *amino acids* even when food is available.
*   **D: Du’a (Dehydration):** Dehydration is listed as a problem, but it's a consequence of the lack of a proper food source rather than a direct consequence of amino acid deficiency itself.

Miseensonni hawaasa aadaa tokkoo yeroo heddu akkamitti walitti dhufeenya garicha waliin qaban ibsu?,"The correct answer is **D: Istaayilii akka mallattootti fayyadamuun (Using style as a symbol)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Miseensotni kutaa aadaa miseensummaa isaanii istaayilii isaanii karaa hiramaa fi mallattoodhaan fayyadamuudhaan, kunis kan dabalatu fashinii, maneerizimii, fi argoti dha.""  This translates to: ""Cultural actors use their style as a symbol, using clothing and signs, which goes beyond fashion, mannerism, and artistry.""

This directly connects the use of style and symbols by cultural actors to their ability to connect with and represent their cultural identity. The other options, while potentially contributing to cultural understanding, are not the *primary* way actors use style to connect with the audience as described in the text.

Here's why:

The question refers to the theory of group polarization. This theory states that discussions within a group tend to strengthen the initial inclinations of the group members.  If a small group is already inclined towards negative behaviors, the discussion within the group will likely reinforce and amplify those behaviors. The core of group polarization is that individuals, when interacting within a group, become *more* extreme in their views, whether positive or negative.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Daa’mni sun amala badaa keessatti hirmaachuu dhiisuu yaala** (The group avoids participating in negative behaviors): This contradicts the concept of group polarization, which implies the opposite - that negative behaviors are reinforced.
*   **C: Daa’imni sun haala hawaasaa keessaa ni baha** (The group remains within the social norms): While groups *can* adhere to social norms, group polarization suggests they are more likely to deviate, especially if the existing inclination is towards negativity.
*   **D: Daa’mni sun saba xiqqaa biraa wajjin walitti dhufuu ni dida** (The group refuses to interact with other small groups): This is an irrelevant detail and doesn't connect to the core idea of group polarization.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting group polarization is that the group *participates* in negative behaviors and they are amplified by the interaction.

Here's why:

The text states that ""ijoollummaatti hubannaa kan guddifatanii fi qoqqoodinsi sanyummaa kunneenis amala isaanii ni miidha"" which translates to ""their understanding of beauty is deepened and their sense of beauty is reflected in their behavior.""  

The example given reinforces this: children who are ""not able to learn"" (meaning they struggle academically) are shown to understand and appreciate beauty when presented with something visually appealing. This demonstrates that their *behavior* changes in response to their perception of beauty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saba xiqqaa isaan ittiin of waaman (The few things they use to adorn themselves):** While adornment can be related to beauty, the text focuses on a broader impact of beauty on behavior, not just on external appearances.
*   **C: Walitti dhufeenya ijoollee biroo waliin qaban (The friendship shared with other children):** Friendship isn't directly linked to a child's sense of beauty in the context of the provided passage.
*   **D: Hiika sanyii qaban (The meaning of beauty):** The text emphasizes *how* beauty is understood and *reflected* in behavior, not the inherent definition of beauty itself.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa akkaataa guddina daa’ima namarraa adda bahee guddatee waliin kan hin deemne kami?","The correct answer is **A: Of-danda’anii jiraachuu (Self-reliance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""diiggaloo"" (orphans) are children who have lost both parents (usually their entire family) and have been left unattended.  These children often develop survival skills and are resourceful in finding food and protection. The passage highlights that they often become skilled in collecting food (like roots or berries) and sometimes even develop a reputation for fighting back (as a defense mechanism).

**Self-reliance** perfectly encapsulates this ability to survive and provide for themselves in the absence of parental care. The other options are not directly supported by the passage's description of how orphans develop.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa daa’imarratti amala qophummaa (feral behavior) sirriitti kan ibsu kami?","The correct answer is **C: Amalli qophummaa daa’ima maatii isaanitiin ittifaman irratti baay’ata.**

Here's why:

The text states that children with ""bineeyyi"" (also called ""diiggalu"") are often children who have been neglected or abused by people close to them (usually their own families). These children exhibit aberrant behaviors as a result of experiencing trauma, physical or emotional abuse.  The text specifically mentions that these behaviors manifest as actions like biting or hitting, directed towards those who have harmed them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amalli qophummaa baay’ensaa miidhama qaamatiin kan dhufuudha (Aberrant behavior is primarily due to physical punishment).** While physical punishment *can* contribute to aberrant behavior, the text emphasizes the role of *neglect and abuse* by close family members as the primary cause.
* **B: Amalli qophummaa hanqina hawaasa waliin walitti dhufuu dhabuurraa maduu danda’a (Aberrant behavior can result from a lack of social interaction).** The text doesn't primarily focus on lack of social interaction as the root cause, but rather on trauma and abuse.
* **D: Amalli qophummaa hanqina dandeettii sammuu (intellectual disabilities) hedduun dhufa (Aberrant behavior occurs more frequently in the presence of intellectual disabilities).** While intellectual disabilities *can* be a factor, the text explicitly links aberrant behavior to *neglect and abuse*, not primarily to intellectual disabilities themselves.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, shaakalawwan armaan gadii keessaa qonna jireenya maatii qofaaf ta’u bu’uura godhateen wajjin kan hin deemne kami?","The correct answer is **B: Nyaata namoota biraatti gurguruuf omishuu (Extending the honey production to include other people)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Oomisha yeroo jechuun is traditionally limited to the family's consumption and not shared with others. Option B directly contradicts this traditional practice by suggesting expanding honey production to include other people. The text implies this expansion is a negative development, as it deviates from the original purpose of the Oomisha.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Omisha fedhii maatii qotee bulaa guutu irratti xiyyeeffachuu (Focusing on increasing the family's honey production)** - This aligns with the traditional practice described in the text, where the focus is on the family's needs.
* **C: Faallaa maloota ammayyaa omisha baay’ee irratti xiyyeeffachuu (Focusing on the high quality of bee breeds and increased honey production)** - Similar to option A, this emphasizes increasing honey production for the family.
* **D: Sanyiin naannoo qotee bulaarraa akka ta’u gochuu (Ensuring the temperature of the beekeeping area)** - This is about maintaining the ideal environment for bee activity, not about who the honey is shared with.



"
Shaakalawwan armaan gadii keessa qonna jireenya maatii qofaaf ta’u (subsistence agriculture) sirriitti kan ibsu kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Guutummaatti mala orgaanikiiti (Completely organic farming)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Oomisha yeroo gabaabaa gidduutti oomishamee nyaata qonnaan bultootaafi maatii isaani qofaaf oolu, kan gabaaf hin oolle jechuudha. Qonni sabistansii salphaa, yeroo hedduu Organikii kan ta’ee..."" (The harvest of crops grown during the general harvest is meant only for the children and their families, not for sale. The crops are substance-based, mostly organic...). This clearly indicates that the farming method is organic.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Callaa guddisuuf maloota addaa fayyadama (Using additional methods to increase yield):** While organic farming *can* sometimes use methods to increase yield, the primary defining characteristic mentioned in the passage is the organic nature of the crops.
* **C: Qotee bultoonni omisha isaanii naannoo isaanitti akka qoodan hayyama (The children should use the produce of their harvest to feed their livestock):** This describes a *use* of the produce, not the farming *method* itself.
* **D: Ammayyuu qotee bultoota biyyoota tokko tokko keessa jiraniin fayidaarra oolaa jira (In general, the children benefit from the produce in each farm):**  This is a general statement about the benefit, not about the specific farming method.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer because the passage explicitly connects the farming method to organic practices.



"
Godambaa daawwachuu gosa turizimii kam jalatti ramadama?,"The correct answer is **B: Turizimii bashannanaa (Happy Tourism)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines ""Tuuriizimii bashannanaa"" as tourism where people take a break from their daily work and enjoy themselves. It mentions things like relaxing beaches, pleasant parks, and beautiful landscapes as examples of what makes people happy tourists.

Option B directly aligns with this definition. The other options are not explicitly discussed in the passage as the primary type of tourism being described.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, namoota bashannana deemaniif maaltu akka dursaatti fudhatama?","The correct answer is **A: Aadaa naannoo irratti xiyyeeffachuu (Focusing on the culture of the region)**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Tuuriizimii aadawaa"" (quality tourism) aims to allow tourists to ""daawwachuu nama tokkoo seenaa fi aadaa isaa baruuf"" (learn about the history and culture of a people).  Option A directly reflects this focus on culture.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Hojii isaanii guyyuu irraa boqachuu (Leaving their daily work)** - This is a consequence of tourism, not the primary driver of its success in terms of making people happy.
*   **C: Bakkeewwan mimmiidhagoo ilaaluu (Visiting scenic spots)** - While scenic spots are part of tourism, the text emphasizes understanding the *people* and their culture, not just the scenery.
*   **D: Seenaa bakka sanaa hubachuu (Learning the history of the place)** - While learning history is important, the text highlights the importance of learning the culture as well.



"
Waldaa naannoo keessatti sodaa jijjiiramaa hir’isuuf waanta gargaare kan kuticha keessatti eerame maalidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeroo amala intarpiriinuraalii (entrepreneurial behavior) milk’aa ta’e yaadachuu.**

The text explicitly states: ""Fakkeenya kana keessatti, fakkeenya amala hojii uumummaa duraa yaadachuunii akkasumas milkaa’ina mirkaneessuun namoonni carraa haaraa akka banan akkasumas mana amantaa kiiristaanaa naannawaatiif kallattii haaraa ta’e gargaara."" This translates to: ""For example, considering the idea of pre-community work and, through the performance of the initiative, people cutting hair for charity and donating the proceeds to the local Christian church.""  This example directly relates to entrepreneurial behavior - identifying a need (charity, hair donations) and creating a way to fulfill it (cutting hair for a cause).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Namoota aadaa dhaabbatichaa irratti dhiibbaa fidan irraa hubannoo argachuu:** While understanding the experiences of those who contributed is helpful, the text emphasizes *thinking* about an entrepreneurial approach, not just learning from past actions.
* **C: Waantoota dhaabbaticha gaggeessan bira gahuu:** This is too broad. While supporting the initiative is important, the text highlights the initial *thought process* behind it.
* **D: Seenaa dhaabbatichaa hubachuu:**  Understanding the history is part of a larger picture, but the text's core message revolves around the innovative idea of applying entrepreneurial principles.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, seenaa nama tokkoo hubannoo argachuun maalif nama garagaara?","The correct answer is **A: Sodaa jijjiiramaa hir’isuu (Reducing social distance)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that hearing personal stories of hardship, struggles, and resilience helps bridge the gap between people. It mentions that sharing these stories reduces social distance and allows for empathy and understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Duudhaalee guddisuu (Increasing pride):** While stories of resilience *can* inspire pride, the primary focus of the passage isn't on boosting individual pride. It's about connection and understanding.
* **C: Dhaabbaticha keessatti iddoo ofii kennuu (Self-sacrifice within the community):** Self-sacrifice is mentioned as an *outcome* of empathy and understanding, not the *reason* why knowing a story is helpful.
* **D: Amala intarpiriinuraalii fooyyessuu (Increasing intercultural practices):** The passage focuses on *intrapersonal* connection – connection between people within the same community or background, not necessarily across different cultures.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa barachuudhaf mala postmodarnii sirrii kan ibsu kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Barachuu keessatti kuni mudaa hin qabu kan jedhamu hin jiru** (Learning doesn't have a fixed or absolute standard).

Here's why:

The text argues that learning isn't just about acquiring facts or passively absorbing information from television. It emphasizes the active process of connecting learning with practical application and personal growth.  It highlights how simply watching educational TV or reading doesn't automatically translate to positive change in one's life.  

This aligns perfectly with a postmodern perspective, which challenges the idea of universal truths, fixed meanings, and objective standards. Postmodernism emphasizes the subjective and context-dependent nature of knowledge.  Therefore, the text suggests there's no single ""right"" way to learn – what's valuable depends on the individual, their goals, and the context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shaakalliwwan barachuu tokko tokko kaan irra fayidaa qabeessadha** (Some learning methods are more beneficial than others): While there might be differing degrees of effectiveness, the text doesn't advocate for a hierarchy of methods. It critiques the *passive* consumption of information, not necessarily all methods.
* **B: Barachuun wantoota ni shaakalla jennee amannu irratti xiyyeeffachuu qaba** (Learning focuses on believing in what it challenges):  This is a misinterpretation. The text isn't about believing in challenging ideas; it's about the *application* and *impact* of learning, regardless of its content.
* **C: Maloonni barachuu tokko tokko kan biraa irra ni caala** (Some learning methods are superior to others): As explained in A, the text doesn't establish a hierarchy. It critiques a specific kind of learning (passive consumption) rather than all methods.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa mala barachuu poostmodarnii sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Muuxannoon barachuu nama baratuufi beekumsa dhiyaate irratti hundaa’a.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Barachuun kan inni raawwatu muuxannoo barataatii fi beekumsa dhiyaate gidduutti."" (Learning is what is done between the learning content and the knowledge gained.)

Option C reflects this core idea of the text.  The other options are either directly contradicted by the text or are not central to the argument.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Odeeffannoo barachuuf maloota heddutu jira (There are many learning methods for information).** While the text discusses the shift towards TV learning, it doesn't emphasize the *abundance* of methods.
* **B: Maloonni barachuu tokko tokko kan biraa caala xiyyeeffannoon kennamuufii qaba (Each learning method has its own special focus).** The text doesn't discuss the distinct focuses of different learning methods.
* **D: Beekumsi hojiirra oolchinee hin beekne ammayyuu taanan barachuun gaaridha (Learning is a waste if the knowledge gained is not applied in practice).** The text *argues* against this notion, highlighting the negative consequences of *not* applying learning, but it doesn't frame *unapplied* knowledge as inherently wasteful.



"
"Yeroo sa’aatii hirribaa idileetti beekatuma erga dammaqneen booda, kanneen keessaa adeemsa hirriiba adda kutuu gidduu kan galu (interfere ) kami?","The correct answer is **C: Alaarmii minjaala siree cinaarra jiru cufuun daqiiqaa digdama booda deebi’anii rafuu.**

Here's why:

The passage describes a technique to induce a ""sammuun akka ka'uu taasisu"" (a sensation of orgasm) through focused mental imagery and relaxation.  The key is to *not* interrupt the process once it's started.  

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Osoo deebi’anii hin rafin dura sa’aatii tokkoof walakkaaf dubbisuu (Talking for an hour before returning):** This would break the concentration and relaxation needed for the technique to work.
* **B: Mana fincaanii dhaqanii deebi’anii rafuu (Returning home after going to the fincaan):**  This is irrelevant to the interruption of the technique itself.
* **C: Alaarmii minjaala siree cinaarra jiru cufuun daqiiqaa digdama booda deebi’anii rafuu (Turning off the alarm clock near the bed and returning after a few minutes):**  This is the only option that describes an *interruption* of the process. Turning off the alarm would break the mental focus and relaxation.
* **D: Bidhaan minjaala siree cinaa jiru irraa fudhatanii dhuguuf hirribaa dammaquu (Inducing orgasm by taking advantage of the sound from the alarm clock near the bed):** This describes using the alarm as a stimulus, which isn't the intended method described in the passage.

Therefore, option C is the only one that represents a deliberate interruption to the process described.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa hirriba addaan kutuu kan sirriitti hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Kaayyonsaa akka ati guutummaatti of-hin dammaksineedha (Your goal is to fully take care of yourself)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a process aimed at deep relaxation and rejuvenation. The core motivation is to allow the person to fully rest and recover, addressing their self-care needs.  The other options are not the primary or stated purpose of the described process:

* **A: Sa’aatii uumamaan nu keessa (biorhythm) jirurratti hundaa’uu danda’a (It can be based on your internal clock/biorhythm):** While the process *can* be timed based on biorhythms, it's not the *reason* for the process.
* **C: Adeemsichi kan raawwatu yeroo sa’aatii hirribaa kee idileetti (The process is executed when your relaxation time is optimal):** Similar to A, timing is a factor, not the main purpose.
* **D: Dammaquu booda, kaayyonsaa sa’aatii lama keessatti deebi’anii rafuudha (After relaxing, your goal is to return in two hours):** The text explicitly states the person is *encouraged* to rest and relax before returning, not to return after a specific time.



"
Sammuun yommuu irra deddeebin abjuu abjootu maaltu dabala?,"The correct answer is **D: Yeroo sadarkaa hirribaa abjuun itti uumamu gidduu jiru (During the stage of reduced brain activity)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the reason why we fall asleep quickly is because the brain activity during REM sleep (rapid eye movement) is reduced.  The text says: ""Bu’aa abjuu ifa galaa kan dheerina yeroo biyyoota REM gidduu jiruu babal’isuuti."" (The main benefit of falling asleep quickly is because it promotes brain activity during REM sleep.) and later ""Sochiwwan ijaa akka tasaa halkan tokkoo muraasa qabaachuudhaan, haalli ati irriba dhugaa keessatti argattuu fi qaamni kee itti haaromfamu kun, irra-deddeebiin isaa muraasa waan ta’eef rakkoo ta’uu hindanda’u."" (With the eyes being still, you become aware of sleep and your body becomes relaxed, and because its brain activity is reduced, it's not a problem.)

Therefore, the passage is directly linking the quick onset of sleep to the brain being in a state of *reduced* activity during REM sleep.
"
Miidhawwan negatiiva armaan gadii keessaa rafanii osoo ofirraa hin bu’in abjoochuun (lucid dreaming) qaama irratti qabu kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Halkanitti sadarkaan hirribaa abjuun itti uumamu hir’achuu**.

Here's why:

The text states that lucid dreaming (abjiin ifa galaa namtolchee) is associated with increased activity in the brain regions related to REM sleep (yeroo biyyoota REM gidduu jiruu babal’isuuti). It also explains that the feeling of being aware you are dreaming, combined with the brain's activity, prevents the dream from being problematic. The key takeaway is that lucid dreaming is linked to heightened activity in the brain areas associated with REM sleep.  Option B accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dheerinni sa’aatii sadarkaa hirribaa abjuun itti uumamu gidduu jiru hir’achuu:** While related to REM sleep, it doesn't pinpoint the location of the activity.
* **C: Rafanii osoo ofirraa hin bu’in abjoochuu irratti hirkachuu:**  This is a description of lucid dreaming, not what it *does* to the brain.
* **D: Halkan halkaniin sadarkaan hirribaa abjuun itti uumamu dabaluu:** The text says *increased activity*, not that the activity *increases in that location*. While the activity *is* in that location, the wording of option D is slightly off.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, gareen qaaman wal arguufi gareen karaa marsaa inatneetii wal argu akkamitti wal-fakkaatu?","The correct answer is **B: Gareen lachuu hojiisaanii guyyuu keessatti sadarkaa aangoo garaa garaa qabu.**

Here's why:

The text describes virtual reality (VR) as a shared environment where users can interact with each other as avatars, regardless of physical location. It also highlights the concept of an ""unseen presence"" – a virtual entity that represents all users and facilitates communication.

Option B directly aligns with this description.  The text implies that different groups or entities within the VR environment might have varying levels of authority or power (""sadarkaa aangoo garaa garaa qabu"").  This authority structure could influence how they interact and communicate within the VR space.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Gareeewwan lachuu sadarkaa tokkoon akka hojjatantu irraa eegama:** This is too vague. While groups may operate at different levels, the text doesn't explicitly say this is the *primary* way they interact.
* **C: Gareen lachuu garee bulchiinsaa hin mul’annetti gabaasu:** The text doesn't state that groups don't address leadership; rather, it implies a complex power dynamic where leadership may be represented through the ""unseen presence.""
* **D: Gareen lachuu zoonii sa’aatii wal-fakkaatatti hojjatu:** While time-synced interactions are common in VR, the text doesn't specifically focus on time zones as a differentiator in how groups interact.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the relationship between different groups (represented by their authority levels) in the virtual reality environment described in the text.



"
"Kiticha irratti hundaa’un, garee qaaman wal-arguufi karaa onlaayinii wal argu ilaachisee himni dhugaa hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **B: Gareen onlaayinii yeroo baay’ee garee qaaman wal-arguuf akka bakka odeeffannoo ykn qunnamtiitti gargaara.**

Here's why:

The text highlights that virtual reality (VR) allows users to interact with each other in a more natural and engaging way than traditional methods. It emphasizes the concept of a ""virtual space"" where all users are connected.  It also notes that VR offers autonomy and allows for interactions that wouldn't be possible in the physical world.

Option B directly reflects this:  VR (or ""online groups"" in this context) significantly helps physical groups with information sharing and communication.  The text implies that VR facilitates the connection and interaction that are crucial for effective group communication.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Gareen qaaman wal-argu yeroo heddu sadarkaa olaanatti taa’ama** - While VR is growing, the text doesn't state it's *extremely* popular.  It focuses more on its potential for group interaction.
* **C: Gareen qaaman wal-argu garee onlaayinii caala aangoo xiqqaa qaba** - The text actually suggests the opposite – VR gives users more autonomy and capabilities than traditional groups.
* **D: Zoonin sa’aatii garaagar ta’uun garee onlaayinii fayyaduu danda’a** - The text doesn't mention time zones as a factor in using online groups.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa tiyoorin fedhii gochaa namaa murteessu qoratu (content theories) kan irratti hin xiyyeeffanne kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Akaataa itti nama tokko naannon isaa gochaa isaarratti dhiibbaa godhu (How a person tends to organize their activities within their area of expertise)**.

Here's why:

* **Content theories** focus on *what* motivates people. They deal with the underlying needs and drives that influence behavior. 
* **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs** and **Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory** (mentioned in the text) are both examples of content theories because they identify the specific needs that motivate individuals.

Option B, ""How a person tends to organize their activities within their area of expertise,"" describes a **process theory**, which focuses on *how* people are motivated and how they approach tasks. It's not about the underlying needs themselves, but the way those needs translate into behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fedhiiwwan haaraa nama gaheessa irratti mul’atan (The influence of external factors on human behavior):** This relates to **process theories** (how behavior is influenced) and **situation theories** (the immediate context).
* **C: Fedhii hubatame (Learned motivation):** This is a component of both content and process theories. While the *needs* might be learned (content), the *process* of how those needs manifest can also be learned.
* **D: Waanta namoonni jaalatan hubachuu (What people like to learn):** This is more closely related to content theories, specifically related to needs for knowledge and growth.



Therefore, option B is the only one that doesn't directly address the *what* of motivation as explored by content theories.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qaama seera sittii kaasuu (object of the rule of thirds) kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Suuricha bakka sirriifi murtaa’aa ta’e kaa’uu** (Placing the pictures in the intersection of the grid lines).

Here's why:

* **The Rule of Thirds** is a guideline for composition. It suggests dividing an image into nine equal parts with two horizontal and two vertical lines. The points where these lines intersect are considered visually appealing places to position key elements of your image.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Suurri eessa akka kaa’amuuf ka’uumsa (baseline) uumuu** (Creating a baseline to position the pictures): While creating a baseline *helps* in applying the rule of thirds, it's not the *rule itself*.
* **B: Suura keessatti humnaafi lubbuu horuu** (Positioning the power and eyes in the picture): This is a general composition guideline, but not specifically tied to the rule of thirds.
* **D: Suura keessatti namuusa bu’uuressuu** (Filling the picture with objects): This is generally *not* recommended for good composition.  The rule of thirds encourages *negative space* as well.



Therefore, option C directly reflects the core principle of the rule of thirds.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa suura abbaa foormaatii 35mm kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Addunyaarratti formaatii beekamaadha (It is a popular format worldwide)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""addunya irratti mm35 dha, kan hangi filmii isaa kan filmii anaalogii ta’ee cufa ta’eedha. Har’as ni qophaa’a, garuu baayyee barbaachisaan, reeshoon haalasaa qabiyyee si’eessituu kaameeraa fakkii dijitaalaan dhaalamee jira.""  This translates to: ""It is 35mm worldwide, although its film is an analog film that is fading. However, it is still popular, and many cameras have been equipped with digital imaging sensors.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ammayyuu hojjatamaa jira (It is still used):** While true, the passage focuses on its popularity *worldwide* as a defining characteristic.
* **B: Formaatii kaameeraa dijitaalan fudhatame (It is accepted by digital camera formats):**  The passage *mentions* digital cameras, but the key point is 35mm's worldwide *popularity*, not that it's accepted by digital formats.
* **C: Formaatiwwan beekamoon irraa addatti reeshoo addaa qaba (It has a distinct aspect ratio compared to other popular formats):** The passage mentions the aspect ratio (3:2) but doesn't say it's *distinct* compared to *other* formats. It focuses on its widespread *use*.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, warshaalen yommuu qulqullina omisha leenisiwwanii dabalaa deeman, leensiwwan guddistuun (zoom lenses) hangam fooyya’an?","The correct answer is **A: Saffisa leensiwwanii guddaa qabu (Having larger lens elements)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that zoom lenses achieve their wide range of focal lengths by having a greater number of lens elements and their ability to move relative to each other.  Option A directly reflects this: larger lens elements are key to creating the zoom functionality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ifti xiqqaan yeroo jirutti itti fayyadamuuf salphaadha (Are advantageous for use with smaller apertures):** While zoom lenses *can* be used with smaller apertures, it's not the *primary* reason they zoom. Aperture control is a separate aspect of lens functionality.
* **C: Qulqullinni suura isaanii leensiwwan dheerina qiyyaafannoo fiksidii (fixed focal length) wajjin wal-fakkaata (Their image circle design is compatible with fixed focal length lenses):**  Compatibility is important, but it doesn't explain *how* zoom lenses achieve their zoom range.
* **D: Leensiwwan ijoo (prime lenses) caala kompileeksiitii leensii xiqqaa qabu (Prime lenses have a simpler lens complexity compared to prime lenses):** This is incorrect.  Prime lenses are *simpler* than zoom lenses, not the other way around.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately explains the core mechanism behind how zoom lenses achieve their zoom range according to the provided text.
"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessa jiru irratti hundaa’un, leensiwwan guddistuun leenjiiwwan ijoo caalaa yoom filatamu?","The correct answer is **A: Qaawwan (aperture) guddaan xiyyeeffannoo yoo ta’e (Larger aperture for greater depth of field)**.

Here's why:

* **Depth of Field:** The passage explicitly states that telephoto lenses (leensii ilaalcha xiyyeefanno dheerinni) have a greater depth of field than prime lenses (leensota piraayimii caalaa guddaadha). Depth of field refers to the area in an image that appears in focus.
* **Aperture and Depth of Field:**  A larger aperture (smaller f-number like f/2.8) creates a shallower depth of field.  A *smaller* aperture (larger f-number like f/8 or f/11) creates a *greater* depth of field.  This is how photographers control how much of the image is in focus.
* **The Passage's Point:** The passage implies that the advantage of telephoto lenses is their ability to keep more of the scene in focus. This is directly related to the larger depth of field achievable with smaller apertures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qabiyeewwan leensii xiqqaa yoo barbaadde (Smaller lens elements if you want smaller lens elements):** The number of lens elements doesn't directly affect depth of field.
* **C: Bakka (settings) dukkana keessatti ifa fayyadamuu hin barbaaddu yoo ta’e (If you don't want to use light in dark places):**  This is irrelevant to depth of field.  Exposure settings control brightness, not depth of field.
* **D: Kompileeksiitii fookaali caalu ilaalta yoo ta’e (If you look at the focal complexity):** Focal complexity refers to the lens's ability to focus sharply at different distances. While important for sharpness, it doesn't directly control depth of field.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Mistisizimii sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Gammachuufi tasgabbii sammuu shaakaluu irratti xiyyeeffata (Focuses on joy and the suppression of the body)**

Here's why:

The passage states that Mysticism, in contrast to other paths, focuses on inner experiences like peace, profound understanding, joy, or bliss. It *specifically* contrasts itself with those who are fixated on the suppression of the body and the hardships of life. 

Options B, C, and D all align with the description of Mysticism in the passage. Mystics *do* seek profound understanding, help others on that path, and often involve spiritual practices. However, the passage *explicitly* contrasts Mysticism with the focus on joy and the suppression of the body, making option A the most accurate answer to the question ""Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Mistisizimii sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?"" (Which of the following is *not* secretly emphasized in Mysticism?).

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa xiyyeeffannoo Mistisizimii kan hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **B: Haraa shaakala waan hawaasarraa argamuun beekumsa ykn hubannaa argachuuf dhama’uu** (Seeking knowledge or understanding from things other than the sacred).

The passage defines Mysticism as a spiritual path that seeks a direct, personal experience of the divine or ultimate reality through inner exploration and contemplation, *separate from traditional religious doctrines*. It specifically contrasts with seeking knowledge from external, worldly sources (""shaakala waan hawaasarraa"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhugaa Waaqayyoo hubachuu barbaaduu (Seeking knowledge of God):** This *is* a core element of Mysticism. It aims for a deeper, experiential understanding of the divine, not just intellectual knowledge.
* **C: Gammachuu sammuurratti xiyyeeffachuu (Focusing on ecstatic joy):** While joy is a potential outcome of Mystical practice, it's not the defining characteristic. The passage emphasizes a broader pursuit of knowledge, understanding, and inner peace.
* **D: Waa’ee Waaqayyoo hubachuuf dhama’uu (Seeking to understand the will of God):** This aligns with the Mystical pursuit of understanding the divine, albeit from a more personal and experiential perspective.



Therefore, option B is the *only* one that explicitly represents something Mysticism *is not* – relying on worldly, non-sacred sources for enlightenment.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, hawaasa qotee bulaa eenyutu eegale?","The correct answer is **B: Moriyoorii Odoolawwan Chaatam irraa (Moriori of the Chatham Islands)**.

The text states: ""Haa ta’u malee, ragaan haaraan akka ibsutti Maariyooriin garee Maaworii giddugalaa kan Niiw zeelaand irraa gara oddola Chaataami’tti godaananii aadaa adda nagaan-guutuu kan mataasaanii uummataniidha."" (However, according to oral tradition, the Moriori, a group of Maori from central New Zealand, settled in the Chatham Islands and created their peaceful and gentle culture.)

Therefore, the Moriori of the Chatham Islands are the ones who established a distinct culture.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, gareen Maa’os adamse jiraattota jalqabaa bakka kamiiti?","The correct answer is **C: Odoolawwan Chaatam** (Chatham Islands).

The text states: ""Haa ta’u malee, ragaan haaraan akka ibsutti Maariyooriin garee Maaworii giddugalaa kan Niiw zeelaand irraa gara oddola Chaataami’tti godaananii aadaa adda nagaan-guutuu kan mataasaanii uummataniidha."" This translates to ""However, according to unconfirmed reports, the Moriori people, a branch of the Maori people from central New Zealand, settled in the Chatham Islands and created their own peaceful culture.""
"
Mala Origaamii Piwuurland fayyadamuun haala kam keessatti fooldarii gargaara?,"The correct answer is **A: Foldarichi kan filatu dachaasuu (folds) heddu si’a tokkotti tolchuudha**.

Here's why:

The text states that the ""Piyuurlaandi origami"" allows for a single, continuous folding process from beginning to end, without unfolding. It also emphasizes that the resulting models have crisp, defined edges. This suggests the origami is designed to be folded *into* a shape rather than having many individual folds that need to be manipulated.  The focus is on the final, complete form achieved through a single, cohesive folding sequence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fooldarichi dandeettii sochii qaamaa ammayyaa qaba (The model has good motor skills):** The text doesn't mention anything about motor skills. It's about the folding process itself.
* **C: Fooldarichi origami duubatti dachaasuu gaafatu uumaa jira (The model creates a crisp, sharp fold):** While the models *do* have crisp edges (as stated in the text), the core function of the origami isn't just about creating sharp folds; it's about the continuous, single-process folding.
* **D: Fooldarichi duraan si’a tokko ykn lama qofa yaale (The model has only one or two initial folds):** The text specifically states a *single* continuous folding process, implying there isn't a set number of initial folds.

Therefore, option A best reflects the description of the Piyuurlaandi origami.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Piwuurland origamii sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Fooldiwwan teessuma fuulduratti qajeela (straightforward locations) qabaachuu qabu.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Origami USA was designed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people with disabilities and limited motor skills.  It also emphasizes that the folds are all in straight lines and cannot be folded in a zigzag manner. 

Option C directly reflects these key design principles: **straightforward locations** (meaning easy to fold in a straight line) and the prohibition of **zigzag folds**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fooldariiwwan muuxannoo qabaniif kan yaadameedha** (Designed for those with cognitive abilities) - While helpful for people with disabilities, the primary focus wasn't on cognitive ability. It was on physical limitations.
*   **B: Malichi fooldiwwan duubatti deebisuu hin hammatu** (Zigzag folds are not allowed) - This is *already* stated in the passage. The question asks what *secret* wasn't revealed, implying something more subtle than a direct statement.
*   **D: Fooldariiwwan sochii qaamaa xiqqaa (imited motor skills) qabaniif mala gaaridha** (Suitable for those with limited motor skills) - This is a consequence of the design, not a secret the passage withheld. The design *is* suitable for people with limited motor skills.

Therefore, the secret wasn't the suitability for limited motor skills, but the **straightforward fold locations** that made it possible.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bakki qaroomina sulala Induus (Indus Valley) wajjin walitti hin dhufne kami?","The correct answer is **A: Harappaa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""yeroo muraasni Qaroomina Harapaan jedhani waaman Harapaa booddee, bakki itti argama isaa irraa kan jalqabaa qotame ba’e 1920 keessa.""  This translates to: ""when the Harappan civilization was called, the beginning was extracted from the place where its location was found in 1920 after Harappa.""

Therefore, the Indus Valley Civilization is also known as the Harappan Civilization.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa maqaa Qaroomina Bara Biroonzii kuticha keessatti irratti mariyatemee kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Qaroomina Haraappiyaan**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""yeroo muraasni Qaroomina Harapaan jedhani waaman Harapaa booddee, bakki itti argama isaa irraa kan jalqabaa qotame ba’e 1920 keessa."" This means the Harappan Civilization is considered a later, specific phase *within* the broader Indus-Sarasvati Civilization.  The Indus-Sarasvati civilization encompasses the Harappan Civilization, and other pre-Harappan cultures.

The other options are all directly mentioned as names for the same broader civilization:

*   **Qaroomina Sarasvati:** The text notes that some scholars believe the Indus civilization was originally called Sarasvati.
*   **Qaroomina Indus-Sarasvati:** This is presented as a more accurate or comprehensive name for the civilization.
*   **Qaroomina Sulula Indus:** The text explains that the name ""Indus"" originated from the Sulula river.



Therefore, the Harappan Civilization is the one *not* directly equated with the broader Indus-Sarasvati civilization in the text. It's a specific phase within that civilization."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa fayidaa yeroo dheeraa kan kennu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Kanneen biroo wajjin wal-ta’uu (Being connected with others)**.

Here's why:

The text states that when people live together with their own kind, they tend to benefit more than when they work with those who are different. This directly points to the benefit of **being connected with others who are similar.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fedhii nama tokkoof dursa kennuu (Giving priority to one person):** The text doesn't mention prioritizing individuals.
*   **C: Garee guddaarra waan garee xiqqaa fayyadurratti xiyyeeffachuu (Focusing on a larger group rather than a smaller one):** The text emphasizes the benefit of staying with *one's own kind*, not necessarily a larger group.
*   **D: Albaadhessa ta’uu hubachuun fayidaa qabachuu danda’a (Being organized can be beneficial):** While being organized *can* be beneficial, it's not the primary theme of the passage. The passage focuses on the social aspect of working with similar people.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, xiyyeeffannoon isaanii fayidaa ammee irratti yoo ta’e kanneen armaan gadii keessaa namni tokko kamiif dursa kennuu danda’a?","The correct answer is **C: Wal-gargaarsa (Collaboration)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people often choose to work with those who are more productive and achieve better results. It suggests that individuals should prioritize collaboration to achieve greater benefits. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ofittoo ta’uu dhiisuu (Giving up being competitive):** This isn't the core solution. While collaboration can involve a change in how you compete, it's not about completely abandoning competitiveness.
*   **B: Wal-ta’iinsa (Shared understanding):** Shared understanding is important, but it doesn't directly address how to achieve better results.
*   **D: Alboodhomuu dhiisuu (Giving up being independent):** Similar to A, this isn't the key aspect. Collaboration doesn't mean losing independence; it means working together.

**Collaboration** directly aligns with the passage's message.  By working together and supporting each other, individuals can leverage each other's strengths and ultimately achieve greater benefits, leading to more productive outcomes."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, baasii waraanichaa harka caalu kan danda’e eenyudha?","The correct answer is **C: Mootummaa garboomfataa U.S** (The American Colonial Government).

Here's why:

The text states the Philippines incurred significant debt to the American colonial government as a result of the war. This debt was used to fund the American colonial administration and infrastructure like the Manila Railroad. The American colonial government benefited from this debt, while the Filipino people suffered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mootummaa Filiippins** (Philippine Government): The Philippines was under colonial rule, not an independent government, at the time.
*   **B: Baankiwwan Wool Istiriit** (Wall Street Banks): While Wall Street banks were involved in providing loans, the ultimate recipient of the debt and the entity that benefitted most was the American colonial government.
*   **D: Uummata Filippiins** (Filipino People): The text explicitly states the Filipino people suffered due to the imperialism.



"
Bara Teempilars dura kan dhufu bara kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **C: Jalqaba Bara Giddu Galeessaa** (Early Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The text states that the Templar period occurred during the Early Middle Ages in Europe (11th, 12th, and 13th centuries AD). The Early Middle Ages is the period *before* the High Middle Ages. Therefore, the time before the Templar period would be the Early Middle Ages.
"
Bara Teempilars booda kan dhufu bara kamiidha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bara Giddu Galeessaa Olaanaa**.

The text states that the Templar era ended around the High Middle Ages, which corresponds to the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries in Europe.  The ""Baroota Giddugalaa Olaanoon"" (High Middle Ages) is the period following the Templar era.
"
Waldhaansi ykn adeemsi waldhaansa meedikaalaa ogeeyyiin baqaqsanii yaaluu bara Empaayera Roomaa itti dhimma itti bahaa turan keessatti kan hin eeramne kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Meeshaa akka qabduu fayyadamuun dhangala’uu dhiigaa dhaabuu.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Jarri dhukubsattoota gaangiriiniin dabalatees toornikeetii fi yaa’insa dhiigaa dhaabuuf arterootaan hubaman irraa qaama muruun baayyee beekaman."" This translates to ""For patients with severe gangrene, a lot was known from the application of tourniquets and bloodletting identified by arteries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhiphina sammuu miidhama booda dhufu qorichoota raffisan garaa garaan waldhaanuu (The practice of cauterizing wounds after they are opened with a hot iron):**  While cauterization *was* practiced, the text doesn't mention it as a key area of knowledge *specifically* related to medical practitioners. It focuses more on artery-based bloodletting and tourniquets for gangrene.
* **B: Ikopolaamindhaaf jja biqilootaa irraa kan hojjatame fayyadamuu (Using things made from piglets for leeches):** The text mentions using leeches *from piglets* (Ikopolaamindhaaf jja biqilootaa irraa kan hojjatame) but it doesn't highlight this as a significant area of medical knowledge *practiced by physicians*. It's more about a specific tool they used.
* **D: Dhukkubsattoota gaangiriinii qaban irraa muruu (Applying pressure on patients with gangrene):** Applying pressure (tourniquets) *is* mentioned in the text as a method used for gangrene, but the option doesn't fully capture the action of *applying pressure* to control blood flow.  Option C is a more direct and accurate reflection of what the text describes.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa milkaa’ina damee waldhaansaa ykn meedikaalaa bara Empaayera Roomaa keessatti mul’ate kan hin ilaallanne kami?","The correct answer is **A: Gareen Ogeeyyii fayyaa hundaa’uu (The entire system of medical practitioners)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Roman Empire had a comprehensive system of medical practitioners, including:

*   **Ogeeyyii fayyaa (Medical practitioners):** The emperor appointed knowledgeable medical practitioners.
*   **Qorichoota tasgabbeessanii fi kakaasan (Experienced and renowned doctors):** They were respected and knowledgeable.
*   **Moorfii dabalatee baala biqiltuu pooppii irraa fudhatamanii fi iskoopoolaamiin baala bililtuu heerbeen (Practitioners using poultices of poppy and ointments of crocodile dung):**  This indicates a variety of medical approaches.
*  **Arterootaan hubaman irraa qaama muruun baayyee beekaman (Extensive knowledge gained from understanding arteries):** Demonstrates anatomical understanding.

While options B, C, and D were *components* of the Roman medical system, the text emphasizes the **entire *system* of practitioners** as a key feature that has significantly influenced modern medicine. The text doesn't focus on a single element like the emperor, hospitals, or the war machine. The *whole system* of medical knowledge and practitioners is the most significant takeaway.



"
Dandeettin arguu maalirratti hundaa’a?,"The correct answer is **B: Ulaagaalee organizimii (Functions of the organism)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that intelligence (arguu) is rooted in the functions of the organism and is widespread across all organisms. It mentions the need for complex organs, sensory systems, and a hierarchical structure for intelligent behavior. This directly links intelligence to the *functions* an organism performs.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Orgaanota seensarii mala agartuu (Sensory organs that can perceive):** While sensory organs *contribute* to intelligence, they aren't the foundation of it. Intelligence involves processing and integrating sensory information, which is a higher-level function.
* **C: Sensitiviitii dheerina danbalii tokko tokkoof (Sensitivity of individual nerve cells):**  Nerve cell sensitivity is a component, but not the encompassing basis of intelligence.
* **D: Garaa garummaa sadarkaa cimina dhibee (The level of hierarchical structure of excellence):** Hierarchical structure can support complex intelligence, but it's the *functions* that the hierarchy enables that are the core.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**.



"
Garaagarummaan caasan ijaa orgaanizimoota gidduutti argamu maal irratti hundaa’a?,"The correct answer is **D: Wal-xaxaa ta’uu orgaanizimichaa (The interconnectedness of organisms)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ijaa hojii ijaarsa hedduutu jira, wal xaxaa irra hanga hamma Organizimii irratti hundaa’uti"" which translates to ""The work of symbiosis is extensive, and is based on the interconnectedness of all organisms.""

Therefore, the characteristic of symbiosis (and the resulting functionality) is rooted in the interconnectedness of organisms.  The other options are related to symbiosis, but not the fundamental basis *on which* it is built according to the provided text.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Sikizimii ilaalchisee hima kamtu amanticha sirriitti hin ibsu?","The correct answer is **A: Sikizimiin Hinduu keessatti qoodamiinsa uumameen kan dhufeedha** (Sikhism originated within Hinduism).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Sikh’oonni amantaan isaanii kan Hinduyiizimii irraa akka adda ta’etti ilaalu, yooma Hinduu irraa dhufuu isaa fi aadaa Hinduu ta’uu isaa amanan iyyuu."" (Sikhs considered their faith to be distinct from Hinduism, while believing that they originated from Hinduism and followed Hindu customs.)
* The text also says: ""Sikhisiin amantaa isaanii Gurmaat jedhu, kunis afaan Punjaabii “ karaa warra guuruu” jechuuti."" (Sikhs called their faith Gurmat, which translates to ""the way of the Guru"" in Punjabi.)
* The text further highlights that while Sikhism aimed for peace, it emerged as a counter to the strictures within Hinduism.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Guurun ijoo Sikizimii isa bu’uurati** (The Guru's preachings were the essence of Sikhism's peace): While the Guru's teachings are central, the text emphasizes that Sikhism emerged *in response to* some strictures within Hinduism, suggesting it was more than *just* the Guru's preachings being peaceful.
* **C: Guuruu Nanak erga amanticha hundeessee booda guuruwwan sagal duuka bu’an** (After Guru Nanak established the faith, four more Gurus followed): This is a factual statement about the Sikh Gurus, but doesn't address the core question of how Sikhism's origin is presented in the text.
* **D: Aadawwan Siikizimii tokko tokko Hidu’izimii keessa kan jiraniidha** (Elements of Sikhism are present within Hinduism): The text says Sikhs considered their faith *distinct* from Hinduism, so this option is incorrect.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa hundee amantii Siikizimiiti jedhamee kan fudhatamu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Yaad-rimee guurichaa (The teachings of the Gurus)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sikhisiin amantaa isaanii Gurmaat jedhu, kunis afaan Punjaabii “ karaa warra guuruu” jechuuti. Guuruun amantaa Indiyaanotaa hundaaf wanta bu’uura ta’ee dha garuu Sikhisimii keessatti barbaachisummaa keessoo amantaa sikhii kan uume qabate.""  This translates to ""Sikhs call their faith the Gurmat, which means 'the way of the Gurus' in the Punjabi language. The Gurus brought peace to all Indians, but within Sikhism, the importance of the Gurmat created the essence of Sikh faith.""

The text highlights that the *teachings of the Gurus* are central to Sikhism and formed the foundation of their faith. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Aadawwan Hinduu (Hindu customs):** While Sikhs acknowledged their Hindu origins and some Hindu customs, they developed their own distinct practices within Sikhism.
*   **C: Amantiiwwan Indiyaa kaan fudhachuu diduu (Rejecting Indian beliefs):** Sikhs did *not* reject Indian beliefs entirely, but they synthesized them with their own teachings.
*   **D: Afaan Punjaabii dubbachuu (Speaking Punjabi):** Speaking Punjabi is a practice within Sikhism, but not the core defining element of the faith itself.

Therefore, the teachings of the Gurus are the most fundamental and accurate answer.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ijoolllen waan tokkorratti xiyyeeffachuu hin dandeenye (Attention Deficit Disorder) yeroo baay’ee maal irratti xiyyeeffachuuf rakkatan maalidha?","The correct answer is **A: Hojii mana baruumsaa (Schoolwork)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ijoolleen barnoota DABALATAA fudhatan wantoota akka hojii mana barnootafa irratti xiyyeeffachuun itti cima..."" which translates to ""Children with Attention Deficit Disorder tend to focus on schoolwork..."". The text then contrasts this with other activities they enjoy.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ijoolllen waan tokkorratti xiyyeeffachuu hin dandeenye amaloota balaarra nama buusan maalif qabaatu?","The correct answer is **D: Sammuu isaanii dammaqsuuf (To boost their self-esteem)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that children who struggle to focus on one thing often have low self-esteem because they feel inadequate compared to their peers. The passage mentions that they are often victims of bullying and lack the ability to understand why others behave a certain way or why their intelligence levels differ.

Therefore, the passage implies that helping them focus on one thing will lead to a boost in their self-esteem. The other options are not directly supported by the passage's reasoning. While they might be helpful interventions, the passage specifically connects difficulty focusing with low self-esteem.



"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessa jirurratti hundaa’un, kanneen keessaa fakeenya iskaafholding kan hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **C: Sagantaa qo’annaa ykn barnootaa of-danda’e (Self-paced learning program)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that modular models are superior to traditional methods for learning programming and projects. It mentions that modular models provide ""scaffolding"" – support structures – for learning.  The passage also describes how this scaffolding can be presented in a software environment for practice, feedback, and demonstrating progress. 

A self-paced learning program (or ""sagantaa qo’annaa ykn barnootaa of-danda’e"") directly aligns with the concept of scaffolding because it allows learners to progress at their own speed and receive the necessary support as they go.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Geemii kompitaraa gara jalqabaatti tutooriyaaluu jiru (Beginner computer games with tutorials):** While games *can* be used for learning, they are not the primary example of the scaffolding model described in the passage.
* **B: Tutorii SAT (SAT Tutorials):** SAT tutorials focus on standardized test preparation and are not related to the core concept of programming and project learning discussed in the passage.
* **D: Leenjisaa liigii xiqqaa (Small league practice):** Small league practice is related to sports, not computer programming.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa yaad-rimee iskaafholdingii sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Iskaafholdingiin varchuwaalidhaan jiraachuu danda’a** (Scaffolding can exist virtually).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Iskaafoldootni virchuwaali keessa seenaniiru softwericha keessa fi gaaffachuuf jiru, eyyamuu, fi adeemsa isaa ibsu tarii kan baratootaf dhuunfaati to’achuuf cimaa itti ta’e."" (Virtual scaffolds are inside software and are available for questioning, simulating, and displaying their performance, which is focused on making learning easier for students).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mala barnootaa irra caalmatti akka tumsaati** (Scaffolding is like a world on learning): The text compares scaffolding to a metaphorical ""world"" for learning, but doesn't directly state this.
* **C: Barnoota pirojektii irratti hundaa’e jedhamuunis beekama** (It is known that it is based on project learning): While the text talks about scaffolding in project learning, it doesn't say it's *known* to be based on that.
* **D: Iskaafholdingiiwwan jalqaba shaakala barnootaa keessatti deeggarsa kennuuf gargaaru** (Early scaffolds help provide guidance in the learning process): The text emphasizes scaffolding making learning *easier*, not necessarily providing early guidance.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, fiicharii MySpace kamtu barattoota dubbisuuf rakkatan gargaara?","The correct answer is **A: Kastamaayizeshinii (Customization)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that MySpace allows users to personalize their profiles with various content like blogs, videos, photos, and other media.  It also mentions the ability to add a link to a website.  This ability to customize the profile to suit individual needs and preferences is a key way it helps students communicate.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Biloogiwwan (Blogs):** While blogs are *part* of the customization, they aren't the *primary* way MySpace helps students communicate.
*   **C: Teessiii weebii tokkoo (A single web page):**  Adding a web page is *one* customization option, but not the core function enabling communication.
*   **D: Pirofaayiloota miliyoona 54 (Profiles of 54 million):** The number of profiles is simply a statistic about the platform's popularity; it doesn't explain *how* the profiles facilitate communication.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qaama deebii Kiruushcheev hokkara hojjattootaf deebise kan hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **B: Seera kabachiisu taankii fayyadama (Using tanks to suppress the rebellion)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Khrushchev sent tanks to crush the Polish workers' protests. This is a direct action of suppressing the rebellion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Muummicha ministeeraa haaraa muuda (Appointing a new Prime Minister):** While Khrushchev did have Władysław Gomułka appointed as the new Prime Minister, this was a *result* of the suppression, not an action *taken by Khrushchev to deliver something to the workers*.
*   **C: Mindaa hir’isuu dabaluu (Increasing censorship):** Increased censorship was a standard practice of communist regimes, not specifically delivered *to* the workers as a response to their protests.
*   **D: Gaaffilee diingadee muraasa simachuu (Asking a few questions):** This is nonsensical in the context of the passage. There's no indication that Khrushchev asked questions of the workers.

Therefore, the only option that represents an action Khrushchev *took to deliver something* (in this case, the force to suppress the rebellion) is using tanks.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Poolanditti sababa hokkaraa kan hin turre kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Komunizimii (Communism)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that in Poland in 1956, workers were suffering from food shortages and were dissatisfied with the Communist regime.  The uprising was *against* the Communist government and its policies. The other options are consequences or actions *related to* the uprising, but not the primary cause of the unrest itself.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa walitti dhufeenya USSR fu USA kan hin miine kami?","The correct answer is **D: waa’ee sistamoota ilaalchisee wal-dhabdee (the system of ideological divergence)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:**  ""Lolichi xumuruu isaatiin, walitti bu’iinsi sirnaa, adeemsaa fi aadaa gara kufaatii biyyootaatti geessee."" (From the beginning, the struggle was about the clash of systems, services, and cultures of the two countries.)
* **The USSR and the USA represented fundamentally different ideologies:** Communism (USSR) and Capitalism/Democracy (USA). This ideological difference was the core of their conflict and the driving force behind the proxy wars and global struggle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Garaa garummaa aadaa (Cultural diversity):** While cultural differences existed, the passage emphasizes the *clash* of systems, not just cultural diversity.
* **B: Waa’ee Jarman yaada jiru (The German way of thinking):** This is irrelevant to the USSR-USA conflict.
* **C: Jijjiiramawwan wal-falleessan (Intersecting interests):** While there might have been some intersecting interests at times, the primary conflict was ideological.  The passage focuses on the opposing systems.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessa kaayyoo dhiibbaa narvii (nerve impulses) qaama keessatti erguu sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Marsaa dhiigaa to’achuu (Nerve impulses causing blood vessels to constrict)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks how nerve impulses transmit information without revealing the secret.** The passage states that nerve impulses transmit information throughout the body and help defend against harm.
* **Constriction of blood vessels** is a key way nerve impulses can control bodily functions without broadcasting the specific information. When a nerve impulse causes a blood vessel to constrict, it can limit blood flow to an area, effectively isolating the problem or preventing the spread of injury/infection. This action happens internally and isn't readily apparent to external observers.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Marsaa dhiigaa suuta akka deemu gochuu (Blood vessels causing blood to flow):** This is the opposite of what's being described.  Constriction *reduces* blood flow.
    * **C: Hoomostaasisii tursiisuu (Maintaining homeostasis):**  While nerve impulses *contribute* to homeostasis, this is too general. The question asks specifically about *how* information is transmitted secretly.
    * **D: Rakkoo qaamaa cimaa ittisuu (Reducing pain):** While nerve impulses are involved in pain perception, the question is more about the secret transmission of information, not specifically pain reduction.



Therefore, nerve impulses causing blood vessels to constrict is the best explanation for how information is transmitted secretly within the body.



"
Pileetoo Giizaa irratti maaltu argamuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **D: Piraamiidii Guddicha**

The text explicitly states: ""Siidaan dirree wal-qixxee Giizaa, yookiin “Nikropolisii Giizaa” Sulula Du’aa Gibxii keessa jiru Piraamidoota hedduu (isaan keessa Piraamidii guddicha kan jedhamutu hundarra caala)..."" which translates to ""The Giza Plateau, or the ""Necropolis of Giza"" contains many pyramids (including the Great Pyramid)...""

While options A, B, and C might be found on the Giza Plateau, the question asks what you can *find* there, and the text highlights the Great Pyramid as a prominent feature.
"
Kaayyon Piraamiidii Guddichaa maal ture?,"The correct answer is **B: Fara’oof kabaja kennuu** (To honor the Pharaohs).

The text explicitly states: ""Piraamiidiin Guddichi kabaja Fara’oon Kuufuutiif ijaarame..."" (The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...).  While the other options might be related to pyramids in general, the text focuses specifically on the purpose of the Great Pyramid.
"
Namicha abiddaan mana sagadaa sana balleesse beekuu keenyaf eenyutu itti gaafatama?,"The correct answer is **A: Warra Efesoon (The Ephesians)**.

The passage states: ""Warri Efesiyaa, hedduu dheekkamanii, maqaan Herostraatos yoomiyyuu akka hin galmoofne ibsa kennii jiru."" which translates to ""The Ephesians, greatly distressed, gave an account of the name Herostratus as they could not remember it.""

The question asks who was blamed for the destruction of the temple. The Ephesians were the ones who witnessed the event and were distressed by it, and their testimony is key to the story. While Herostratus committed the act and Alexander had previously attempted to appease the gods, the Ephesians are the ones directly associated with the event and its aftermath in the provided text.
"
Mana sagadaa Arxeemis deebisanii ijaaruu ilaalchisee himni sirriin kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Aleeksaandar Guddichi erga mo’ee booda ijaarame**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Booda, erga Alegzaandar du’ee, gamoon waaqeffannaa sun dhaloota Kiristoos dura bara 323 keessa deebi’ee ijaarame."" (After Alexander died, the pagan temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baasii ijaarsichaa kan kaffale Aleeksaandar Guddicha** (Alexander the Great paid for the rebuilding): While Alexander *intended* to rebuild it, the passage says his payment was never fulfilled.
* **C: Baasii ijaarsichaa akka danda’uuf Herostiraatastu ajajame** (Herostratos was executed for rebuilding it): The passage says Herostratos *rebuilt* it, not that he was executed for it.  He was executed for something else (mocking the gods).
* **D: Bara 320 BCE tti ijaarame** (It was rebuilt in 320 BC): The passage clearly states 323 BC.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, uumamni dur durii miila lamaan deemuu kan jalqabe yoomi?","The correct answer is **A: Waggaa miliyoona torbaatama dura (About 3.9 million years ago)**.

The text states: ""Sanyiin mil-lamee waggoota miiliyoona 4.2-3.9 dura hambaa lafee Aawustraaloopitikas keessaa argaman..."" (The two-million-year-old cold was found in Australopithecus fossils 4.2-3.9 million years ago...) and ""...ta’us seehelaantirooppiis miila lamaan dursanii waggoota miiliyoona torba dura deemuu hin hafani."" (...but Australoanthropus didn't appear until two million years later, about three million years ago.)

Therefore, the earliest appearance of Australopithecus (the group that saw the two-million-year-old cold) was around 3.9 million years ago.
"
Sanyiiwwan kanneen keessaa dhaabbataadhan miila lamaan kan deeme kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelantirooppas**.

The passage states: ""seehelaantirooppiis miila lamaan dursanii waggoota miiliyoona torba dura deemuu hin hafani."" This translates to ""Sahelantiroopiis arrived two million years earlier and three million years ago.""  The question asks which of the mentioned groups arrived two million years ago, and the passage indicates Sahelanthropus did.



Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hoomoo Eraaktas:** The passage states Hominin arrived *later* than Sahelanthropus.
* **C: Ispeshaalayizeeshinii Baayipeedal:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Awustiraalopitikas:**  The passage mentions Australopithecus arriving *later* than Sahelanthropus."
Yeroo WWII humni galaanaa Jarman maal galmaan gahuuf yaalaature?,"The correct answer is **D: Ameerikaan akka namoota fi meeshaalee hin fudhanne ittisuu.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Germany tried to disrupt transatlantic traffic (the Atlantic Route) to prevent the Allies (especially the Americans) from sending people and supplies to Britain. The passage specifically mentions the Battle of the Atlantic and Germany's efforts to sink ships carrying supplies to Britain. Therefore, the goal was to cut off the flow of American aid to Britain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Meeshaalee Biriteen irraa dhufan ittisuu:** While cutting off supplies from Britain was a goal, the passage emphasizes the disruption of the *Atlantic Route* specifically, which included American supplies.
* **B: Biriteen namoota fi meeshaalee akka hin fudhanne ittisuu:** This is partially true, but option D is more precise and captures the overall strategic aim - hindering the flow of American aid.
* **C: Karaa Atilaantikii meeshaalee deddeebisuu:** This is incorrect. Germany was trying to *disrupt* the route, not facilitate the delivery of supplies.
"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, yeroo Duula Kaaba Atilaantikii waraana galaanarraatin eenyutu milkaa’ee ture?","The correct answer is **C: Warra Jarmaniifi fi Warra Biriitish**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ameerikaanotni warra Ingilizii gargaaruuf namaa fi meeshaalee Garba Atilaantikiin ceesisuuf yaalaa turan. Yeroo wal-fakkaataatti, waraanni galaanaa Jarman daandii tiraafikaa kana bidiruu-U dhaan dhaabsisuuf yaalaa turan.""  This means both the British and the German forces were vying for control of the Atlantic.
"
Warri Asiiriyaanotaa yeroo loltoota fardeeniitti fayyadamuu jalqaban waanti hin turre maali?,"The correct answer is **A: Kooraa fardaa (Square Wheel)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kooraan dugda fardaarra ka’amu hin kalaqamne ture..."" which translates to ""They did not create a wheel that rotates on a square axle..."" This means the Assyrians didn't have the technology for a functioning wheel when they started using chariots with square wheels.
"
Waraanniwwan loltoota fardeenii hirmaachise akkamitti gaggeeffame?,"The correct answer is **C: Fardarra taa’anii (From the saddle)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kavalaryiiin loltu dugda fardaa irra taa’ee loluu dha."" which translates to ""The cavalry rode from the saddle.""  This means they fought while mounted on horseback.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lafoo (Truce/Ceasefire):** The text doesn't mention any truce.
* **B: Hidhannoo lolaa malee (Without a lance):** The text mentions lances were used, not that they weren't.
* **D: Loltoota xiqqaadhan (Close-quarters combat):** While cavalry could engage in close combat, the text's focus is on how they fought *while mounted*.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, lammii Baabiloon kan hin argamne eessaati?","The correct answer is **B: Mana sagadaa isa guddatti sirna waaqeffannaarratti argamuu**.

The text states: ""Holqicha galma waaqeffannaa bakkee duwwaa gidduudha qaba, sana booda immoo bakkee qulqullaa’aa keessaa kan luboonni qofti seenuu danda’an jira."" (The main place of worship is in the middle of the courtyard, and then there is a sacred place where people can enter.) This indicates that the temple was located within the sacred area of the religious center. Option B accurately reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mana sagadaa alasaatti aarsaa fiduu** (They offered sacrifices in the outer temple): The text describes a main courtyard and a sacred area, implying a more structured temple layout than just an outer area.
*   **C: Festivaala mana sagadaa alatti taasifamurratti** (During temple festivals): While festivals were likely part of the temple activities, the text focuses on the temple's physical structure and location, not specifically on festivals.
*   **D: Iddoo aarsaa isa keessatti aarsaa fiduu** (They sacrificed in the place of sacrifice within the temple): The text refers to a ""sacred place"" which isn't explicitly stated as ""place of sacrifice"" but is a broader category than just the sacrifice location."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa addatti luba kan ilaallatu kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Ziguraatii**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroo tokko tokko piraamiidiin ijaarsa addaatti bocame, **ziguraatsi** jedhamu, siidaawwan keessa isa tokko akka ta’uuf ijaarame ture.""  This directly translates to ""Sometimes a pyramid was built as a temple, called a **ziggurat**, which was constructed of stacked tiers.""

The passage describes ziggurats as important religious structures in Babylonia. The other options are not directly mentioned or described as the primary focus of religious observation in the passage.
"
Mootii Tuutankamun kabaja (notoriety) kan dhabe yoom ture?,"The correct answer is **C: Erga awwaalli isaa argameen booda** (After his discovery).

Here's why:

* The passage states that Tutankhamun's fame increased significantly *after* his discovery in 1922.  It mentions he wasn't well-known or valued during his lifetime.
* Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they refer to times *before* his discovery or to things that happened after the discovery (like mentions in ancient texts). The key point is his notoriety *rose* after the discovery.



"
Mootii Tuutan kamun mootii Masirii beekamaa kan taasise maali?,"The correct answer is **A: Awwaalli isaa osoo hin diigamin argamuu (The discovery of his tomb intact)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Argamni bakka awwaalchaa kana bara 1922 tti akka beekamuu isa taasiseen."" (The discovery of this site in 1922 made him famous.)  The text also mentions that many of the treasures were found largely untouched, which is a key reason for his fame.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sadarakaa inni tarree mootota duriirratti qabu (His status among ancient rulers):** The text says he wasn't highly regarded by his contemporaries or later rulers.
* **C: Awwaalasaa keessaa bobbocawwan kumaatamni heddu hatamuu (The large number of treasures found in his tomb):** While the treasures are important, the *intact* nature of the tomb is the primary reason for the fame.
* **D: Bara Masirii duriitti beekamtii ykn barbaachisummaa isaa (His fame or popularity during the ancient Egyptian era):** The text states he wasn't famous during his lifetime.



"
Walaleessaan Giriikii Homeer waanti inni gochuu hin dandeenye maal ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhaga’uu (To hear)**.

The text states that Homer was a ""blind bard"" (barreessa goota qaroo dhabeessa). This directly implies that he could not see and therefore could not *hear* in the conventional sense. The other options don't fit the description of Homer being blind.
"
Beekamaan Giriikii hog-barruun alatti waan biraan beekamu eenyudhaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Homeer**.

The passage explicitly states that Homer is the most famous Greek writer, known for composing the epic poems *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey*. The other options are also famous Greeks, but the passage highlights Homer's unparalleled fame as a writer.
"
Maatin Ibrootaa yeroo heddu eessatti dabarsu?,"The correct answer is **C: Bakka manaan ala (Outside the home)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dubartoonni oobdii keessatti midhaan tolchan; dunkaanonnis minjaalawwan daldalaa golgaa hinqabne kan karaatti ija baasanidha."" This describes women weaving cloth and men working with tools to make roads/paths *outside* the home.  The entire paragraph describes activities happening *outside* the house.
"
Maatii Ibrootaaf waanti baay’ee barbaachisaa hin taane maal ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Haala qilleensa isaanii (Their way of building houses)**.

The text explicitly states: ""manni baay’ee barbaachisaa hinturre"" which translates to ""houses were not very desirable/important."" It then goes on to describe their houses: ""Jireenyi warra Ibrootaa hedduun isaa qilleensa banaa keessattidha"" meaning ""Most of their existence is in building houses.""  The text also contrasts their houses with the lack of lush vegetation in Canaan: ""Biyya Kana’aan keessa bosonoonni gurguddoon hin turre, kanaaf muki akka malee mi’aawaa ture"" meaning ""There were no lush trees in the land of Canaan, so their houses were like mud huts.""

Therefore, the passage emphasizes that their building style was a defining characteristic but not necessarily a desirable or ""important"" thing in the broader context. The question asks what was *not* very desirable, and the text focuses on their houses (specifically, the way they were built).  The options related to the houses are the most relevant to the passage's emphasis.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa akka garaa garummaa biyyoota Iskaandineeviyaanitti kan hin ibsamne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Seenicha (History)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yoodhumaa biyyootni hundumti iyyuu ‘Scandinavian’, turan garagarumaa hedduutu ture namoota, mootota, amala fi **seenaa** Deenimark, Swidiin, Norweeyi fi Ayiisland giddu.""  (People, governments, customs and **history** of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland were very similar.)

Therefore, the history of the Scandinavian countries is mentioned as a shared element, but not specifically detailed as a unique aspect of Greenland's history.
"
Jalqaba Giriinland keessa kan qubate eenyu?,"The correct answer is **C: Erik isa Diimticha (Erik the Viking)**.

The passage states: ""Giriinlandiin argatani Giriinland jechuun waaman. Garuu argannoo isaan alatti, gosootni Iskimoo durumaan iyyuu achi jiraachaa turan. Giriinland kan isheen teesse bifa addatiini. Kaaba Sagasiti Eriik inni diimaan akka inni Ayiisland keessa ajjeeffamuuf baafame dubbatu...""

This translates to: ""They discovered Greenland and named it Greenland. However, they found that the first Eskimo tribes were already there. Greenland was named after Erik the Viking, who was sent to Greenland as a colonist from Iceland...""

Therefore, Erik the Viking is credited with discovering and naming Greenland, even though the Eskimo people were already living there.
"
Gareen minjaala osoo hin fayyadamin nyaata nyaachuu fedhan kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhiirota Roomaa dureeyyii (Roman nobles)**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""namoonni dureeyyiin cinaa isaaniitiin irkatanii nyaachisa guddaa waliin nyaachuu jaallatan"" which translates to ""the nobles loved to eat together with great feasts, using their own tableware."" This indicates that the Roman nobles ate with their own utensils, suggesting they had access to food items that were considered more refined and readily available to them.

The question asks who could eat without using metal utensils. The text implies that the common Romans didn't have access to these refined foods and eating utensils.  Therefore, the nobles, who could afford and use their own tableware, are the ones who could eat without metal utensils.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa sirna nyaata Roomaa Durii kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Keessummoonni hiyyeeyyin minjaalarratti nyaatu** (They did not eat foods that grow underground).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the ancient Romans did not eat things like potatoes, tomatoes, onions, or cocoa.  Option A, ""They did not eat foods that grow underground,"" accurately reflects this.  Potatoes, tomatoes, onions, and cocoa all grow underground.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Cilalluu akka fedha nyaataa namaa banutti** (They did not cook food as a way of preparing it): The text says they *did* cook food.  It mentions roasting, boiling, and baking.
* **C: Dhiironni dureeyyiin yeroo irbaataa ni rafu** (The wealthy went out to eat in restaurants): The text mentions that the wealthy enjoyed large feasts with their own food and did not typically eat in restaurants.
* **D: Nyaata waaddii lukkuu tarkii** (They did not eat foreign food): The text mentions that Romans brought food from America and Asia to Europe, so they *did* eat foreign food.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa dhiibbaa yeroo dheeraa kan hin qabne kami?","The correct answer is **D: Aadaa qaroominaa (Civilization)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aadaan qaroominaa beekumsi dhalootaa gara dhalootaatti daddarbuu isaa agarsiisa, faana aadaa yeroo dheeraaf turuufi faffaca’iinsa loogii hinqabne.""  This translates to: ""The fact that the knowledge of civilization is expanding to all people shows that this culture has lasted for a long time and has logical consistency.""  The passage then goes on to discuss the inherent dangers of civilization (""akka qaroomina siritti osoo hin beekamuu dadhabu"" - ""...which can be lost without knowing the civilization"").

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Hawaasa (Society)** - While society is related, the passage focuses on the *civilization* itself, not just the society within it.
* **B: Aadaa xiiqqaa (Small culture)** - The passage contrasts civilization with smaller cultures, highlighting the vastness and lasting nature of civilization.
* **C: Bulchiinsa magaalaa (Municipal power)** - Municipal power is a component of civilization but not the core subject of this paragraph.

Therefore, the paragraph is primarily discussing the **civilization** and its characteristics, and the question asks which is the subject with a lack of long-term peace, which is implied within the dangers of losing civilization.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, biyya kan dursu maalidha?","The correct answer is **A: Aadaa qaroominaa (Civilization)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Qaroominni aadaa qeenxee kan garee namootaa barbaachisaa guddaa waliin jiraatanii fi hojjatan waliin qoodamuudha..."" which translates to ""Civilization is the culture of a large group of people who live and work together...""

The rest of the passage elaborates on the meaning of ""civilization"" and its historical significance.
"
Waa’ee Drukgyal Dzong himni sirrii hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Mo’icha humnoota Tibetan-Mongol kabajuudhaf ijaarame (Was built to subdue Tibetan-Mongol armies).**

Here's why:

The text states: ""bara 1649, Zahabdirangi Nigawaangi Naamgiyeel ayyaaneffannaa moo’ichaa humna warreen Tiibetan-Mongol irratti argatef qopheesse."" This translates to ""In 1649, the conquest of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was established to subdue the armies of the Tibetan-Mongol people.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bakki argamasaa Buutani (Its location is in Bhutan):** The text explicitly says it's in the Paro District of Bhutan (""Diistiriktii Paaroo (ganda Foondey keessa)""). However, the *reason* for its construction isn't its location, but its purpose.
*   **C: Meeshaalen dahannoo hedduun abidaan bade (It is a very elaborate religious structure):** While Drukgyal Dzong is a religious structure, the text highlights its military purpose first.
*   **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel dhaan uumame (Was created by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel):** While it *was* created by him, the text emphasizes the *reason* for its creation – to subdue the Tibetan-Mongol armies. The question asks for the *incorrect* statement about its purpose. While it *was* created by him, the reason he created it is the incorrect part.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate incorrect statement. It is not *primarily* a religious structure, even though it has religious significance. Its core purpose was military.



"
Abidda Drukgyal Dzong tti mudate booda waan uumame himni sirriitti ibsu kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel dhaan eegame**.

The text states: ""Balaa ibiddaa sana booda, masaraan dahannaa sun bakkatti deebifamee akkasumas eegameera, hawwata Bihutaanii namatti tolan keessa isa tokko ta’ee hafuudhaan. **Meeshaan tokkichi hafe suura Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal qofa**"". This translates to ""After the fire, the monastery was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, with the help of a single person: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" Therefore, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was the one who rebuilt the Drukgyal Dzong after the fire.
"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee Kamboodiyaa kamtu sirriidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Warri Veetinaam Phnom Phen balleessan (The Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Penh).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Warreen Tiyaa jaarraa 18ffaa keessa yeroo baayee Kombodiyaa kan qabatanii fi 1772 keessa immoo Piihnoom Piheeniin balleessan."" This translates to ""During the 18th century, the Vietnamese frequently occupied Cambodia and in 1772, they destroyed Phnom Penh.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kaambidyaan bara 1772 tti Taayilaand weerarte (Cambodia was invaded by Thailand in 1772).** The passage says Vietnam invaded, not Thailand.
* **C: Kamboodiyaan jalaba jaarraa 18ffaatti Veetinaamin weeraramte (Cambodia invaded Vietnam in the 18th century).** The passage states the opposite - Vietnam invaded Cambodia.
* **D: Phnom Phen kan barbadeesse warra Taayidha (The Thais destroyed Phnom Penh).** The passage states the Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Penh.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa weerara Kamboodiyaa sirriittti kan ibsu kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Warri Veetinaam si’a heddu Kamboodiyaa weeraran** (The Vietnamese often attacked Cambodia).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Dhuma waggoota jaarraa 18ffaa keessatti Veetinihaamis Kaamboodiyaa weerarteetti."" (In the late 18th century, Vietnam attacked Cambodia.)  This indicates frequent attacks by Vietnam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Warri Taayi fi Veetinaam bara 1772 tti Kamboodiyaa weeraran** (The Thai and Vietnamese attacked Cambodia in 1772). While the text mentions a conflict in 1772, it doesn't say *both* Thailand and Vietnam attacked.  The focus is on Vietnam's actions in the late 18th century.
* **C: Warri Veetinaam Phnom Phen balleessan** (The Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Phen). The text states Phnom Phen was destroyed in 1772, but it doesn't explicitly say the Vietnamese were responsible.
* **D: Warri Taayi si’a heddu Kamboodiyaa weeraran** (The Thai did not often attack Cambodia). The text implies the opposite - Vietnam attacked frequently.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa yeroo Taayiwaan keessa turan kan hin goone kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Taayiwaan daayinaastii Qing tti kennii barbaaduu** (Taiwan requested to be given to the Qing Dynasty).

Here's why:

* The text clearly states that the Qing Dynasty **forcibly took** Taiwan and the area north of the Bashi Channel in 1683. They didn't *receive* it as a request.
* The text details the Dutch establishing a trading post and then the Qing Dynasty taking control.
* Options A, B, and C are all actions described in the text that *did* happen during the Qing Dynasty's rule over Taiwan.



Therefore, the only option that doesn't align with the historical account is that Taiwan requested the Qing Dynasty to give it to them.



"
Walii galteen Shimonoseki maal hundeesse?,"The correct answer is **C: Taayiwan naannolee qarqara galaanaa deebistee to’achuu danda’uu.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bara 1895, ergaa mo’amuun Sino-Japanese jalqabaa dhumeen booda (1894-1895), mootummaan Qing walii galtee Shimonoseki mallatteesse, kan ittin olaantummaa Taayiwaanii hanga Jaapaanitti qabu gad-dhiifame, kan oddolicha hanga bara 1945 tti bulche.""

This translates to: ""In 1895, after the end of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which resulted in Taiwan and the Pescadores Islands being ceded to Japan, and which lasted until 1945.""

Therefore, the Shimonoseki Treaty resulted in Taiwan and the Pescadores Islands being given to Japan. Option C accurately reflects this outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waraana Sino-Japanese Jalqabaa irratti mo’amuu Jaappan:** While Japan won the war, the treaty itself is what ceded Taiwan.
*   **B: Daayinaastii Qing jalatti Taayiwaan akka sadarkaa bulchiinsatti ta’uu:** The treaty *reduced* Qing's control over Taiwan, not elevated it.
*   **D: Angoo Jaappan Taayiwaan irratti:** While Japan later occupied Taiwan, the Shimonoseki Treaty was the initial event that transferred control.



"
Sadarkaan keemikaala pH akkamitti safarama?,"The correct answer is **C: Hamma ayonoota Hayidiroojiinii keemikaalicha keessa jiran**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text explicitly states:** ""Sadarkaan pH hamma aayonoota haayidiroojiinii (H+ keessaa) keemikaala qoratame sana keessaatiin ibsama."" (The pH scale is defined by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+ from the chemical substance).)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Keemikaalichi hammam beezii ykn asiidii akka qabu:** While acidity and alkalinity relate to pH, the pH *scale* itself isn't just about whether a substance is an acid or a base. It's about the *concentration* of H+ ions.
* **B: Pirootoononni meeqa keemikaalicha keessa akka jiran:**  This is related to the number of H+ ions, but it's not the complete definition. The pH scale is about the *concentration* (how many per volume), not just the total number.
* **D: Elektiroononni meeqa keemikaalicha keessa akka jiran:** Electrons are completely irrelevant to the pH scale. The scale is defined by hydrogen ions.



"
Ayonoota Hayidiroojiinii keessaa maaltu haqame?,"The correct answer is **A: Pirootoonota**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ayooniin haayidroojiinii pirotoonii elektiroonii isaan balleessu qaba (atoomiin haayidiroojiiniin pirotoonii tokkoo fi elektiroonii tokko waan qabuuf).""  This directly describes hydrogen ions (H+) as protons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: pH:**  The passage defines pH but doesn't detail what hydrogen ions *are*.
*   **C: Alkaaliinii:**  Alkalinity is related to the presence of bases, which is mentioned, but not the definition of hydrogen ions themselves.
*   **D: Elektiroonota:** While hydrogen ions *can* be involved in electron transfer, the passage specifically identifies them as protons.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa boonuu yk of-tuulummaa leencaa sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Lamaan isaanituu miidhaa kan geessisanii fi madaqan ykn namatti dhiyaataniidha** (They sacrificed animals and/or people).

Here's why:

The passage states that the priests, driven by a desire for power, built impressive pyramids and temples.  It then describes the practice of human sacrifice as part of their religious rituals. The passage explicitly mentions that people (presumably prisoners of war and/or criminals) were sacrificed as offerings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amalli isaanii kan garee sarootatiin wal-fakkaata (Their actions were consistent with the tribe's customs):** While the priests likely operated within the societal norms of their time, the passage highlights that their actions went beyond typical customs – particularly the addition of human sacrifice.
* **B: Reeshiyoon dhiiraa kan dhalaa wajjin yoo wal bira qabamu wal-fakkaataa miti (Their relationship with the local male population was not consistent):** The passage doesn't discuss the relationship between the priests and the general male population.
* **C: Dhiironii fi dhalaan baay’ee walitti dhiyaatu (Men and women interacted a lot):**  The passage doesn't focus on the social interactions between men and women.


Therefore, the only option directly supported by the passage's description of the priests' actions is the human sacrifice.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessa amala leencotaa sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Baay’ee namatti siqu (They were very secretive)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the following:

* **""Leencotni adurreewwan hunda caalaa hawaasummaa qaban, kan gartuu guddaa piraayidsi keessa jiraatanidha.""** (All the buried lectors were more secretive than those in the great pyramid.) This directly indicates their secrecy.
* **""Shamarroonni yeroo hedduu dhiyeenyaan walfakkaatu, maatii guddaa obboleettii fi ilmaan-durbaa ta’uurraan kan ka’e.""** (The workers worked for many years in great secrecy, forming large families of brothers and nephews.) This reinforces the idea of secrecy during construction.
* **""Hoomaan leencaa gocha isaatiin akka hoomaa yeeyyii yookaan sareeti, bineeldota amalaan akka ajaayibaa leenca (garuu adurreewwan guguddoo biroo utuu hinta’in) fakkaatanii fi bineeldota soorrata isaanii ta’aniif balaafamoo kan ta’an.""** (In the end, the lectors, in the manner of the pharaohs, were depicted as wonderful lectors (although with no other decoration) and were buried with their servants, who were killed.) This describes the final burial, but the key aspect is *how* they were buried - in secrecy and with their servants.

The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

* **B: Amalli isaanii kan yeeyyii waliin wal madaala (Their actions were in solidarity with the pharaohs)** - While they were depicted as pharaohs, the passage focuses on their secretive nature.
* **C: Dhiironni fi dhalaan lamaan isaanituu yeroo adamsan baay’ee hamoodha (The two sons and daughters of them were very pious when they died)** - The passage doesn't mention their children or piety.
* **D: Amalli isaanii gosa adureewwanii biroo wajjin wal fakkaata (Their actions are similar to the other buried families)** - The passage explicitly states they were *more* secretive than those in the pyramid.

Hilleettii bineensota gosa kamtu adamsa?,"The correct answer is **A: Adureewwan xixiqqoo (Small Adurrees)**.

The text states: ""Dhumaa irratti, Adurreewwan xixiqqoo hedduutu jira (Adurreewwan badaan kan mana dabalate) kanneen ilbiisota, waan lafarra deemu, loocuu, fi sinbirroo nyaatu.""  This translates to: ""Finally, there are many small Adurrees (larger than the usual ones) that eat insects, ground-dwelling creatures, or termites."" 

The question asks which type of Adurrees are fed by the little birds. The text explicitly says the small Adurrees are the ones that are fed.
"
Adurreewwan xixiqqoon kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kam adamsu?,"The correct answer is **B: Hilleettii (Grasshoppers)**.

The text states: ""Dhumaa irratti, Adurreewwan xixiqqoo hedduutu jira (Adurreewwan badaan kan mana dabalate) kanneen ilbiisota, waan lafarra deemu, loocuu, fi **hilleettii** nyaatu.""

This translates to: ""Finally, many small Adurrewwan (larger than the house ones) eat insects, snails, and **grasshoppers**.""



Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qaama mala ittiin qeerransa (ocelo) adamsan kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Foolii waan isaan adamsanii faana dhahuu.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Saayintistoonni akka yaadanitti bineensi gosa qeerransaa oseloot bineensa nyaatu akka hordofuufi funfatee akka barbaaduufi, lafa jala bakka isaan turan foolii akka fudhuudha.""  This translates to: ""According to scientists, the ocelot, a carnivorous animal, hunts and eats prey, and also consumes the fat found under their skin.""

Option B directly reflects this information. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Naannoo isaan jiran baala wayii daheeffatanii dhokachuu** - The text doesn't mention them digging burrows.
*   **C: Yeroo halkanii waan isaan adamsan faana dhahuu** - The text doesn't specify a particular time of day.
*   **D: Bineensota xixiqoo qofa adamsu** - The text says they eat ""bineensa nyaatu"" (prey) which is not limited to small animals.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qeerransa sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami? ,"The correct answer is **D: Bineensota xixiqqoo adamsuu filatu** (Choosing small animals to eat).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Saayintistoonni akka yaadanitti bineensi gosa qeerransaa oseloot bineensa nyaatu akka hordofuufi funfatee akka barbaaduufi, lafa jala bakka isaan turan foolii akka fudhuudha."" This translates to: ""According to scientists, the carnivorous animal ocelot hunts and eats prey, and the fat layer in the area where the prey was is also consumed.""

The passage *doesn't* mention that ocelots specifically choose small animals. It just says they hunt and eat prey.  The other options are mentioned in the text:

*   **A: Yeroo halkanii sirriitti adamsuu danda’u** (Being able to hunt in secret) - This is mentioned in the description of their hunting behavior.
*   **B: Qaxxisa deemu** (Being stealthy) - This is implied by the ability to hunt in secret.
*   **C: Dandeettin suufuu isaanii dadhabaadha** (Their climbing ability is great) - This is mentioned as a characteristic that helps them get to prey.



Therefore, the only thing *not* explicitly mentioned as a characteristic of ocelots in the text is that they specifically *choose small animals.*



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa akka cimina qeerransaatti (tiger) kan hin fudhatamne kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Harkisuu (Hunting)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the lions are taking a break from hunting (""qeerransi tabba nii ba’aa"").  The question asks what activity is *not* mentioned as being avoided due to the break.  

* **Aaduu (Fighting):**  Implied to be avoided as a strenuous activity.
* **Koruu (Sleeping):**  The passage explicitly states they are resting and sleeping (""dacha shan dhiibu"").
* **Utaaluu (Running):** The passage mentions they are avoiding running (""qeerransi tabba nii ba’aa"").
* **Harkisuu (Hunting):** The passage explicitly states they are taking a break *from hunting*. Therefore, hunting is the activity being avoided.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessa garaa garummaa qeerransaa fi leenca gidduu jiru kan ta’e kami?","The correct answer is **B: Sagalee aaduu isaanii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sagaleen qerransaa akka sagalee guutuu leenca bookkisuu mitii, garuu akka hima iyyaa, jechotaa iyyaa fakkata."" This translates to: ""The language of the leopard is not like the complete language of the lion, but rather like a roaring year, a year's words.""  This emphasizes that their roar (sagalee aaduu) is a key characteristic and a link between the leopard and the lion, representing their shared predatory nature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dandeettii bishaan daakuu isaanii (Their ability to leap):** While leopards are excellent leapers, the text doesn't explicitly state that this is the primary connection between them and lions.
* **C: Fageenya isaan utaalan (Their hunting speed):**  The text mentions their speed, but not as a defining characteristic linking them to lions.
* **D: Humna ittiin harkisan (Their hearing ability):**  Hearing is important for both animals, but the text focuses on their vocalizations as the connecting factor.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, baayolojistoota kaan dura Roobart Hooke maal hojjate?","The correct answer is **A: Seeliwwan du’an ilaala (Observed cells die)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Seelii du’e ilaaluudhaan inni nama jalqabaati"" which translates to ""By looking at cells die, he [Robert Hooke] began.""  This indicates that Hooke's observation of dead cells was the starting point of his work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Orgaanizimii ilaaluf maayikirooskoppii fayyadama (Using a microscope to observe organisms)** While Hooke *did* use a microscope, the text doesn't explicitly say he used it to observe *organisms*. The key is his observation of the cells themselves.
* **C: Isquweeriiwwan muraasa ilaala (Observed a few squares)** The text mentions he saw ""kubbaawwan xixiqqoo"" (small boxes/compartments) which he likened to squares.  It doesn't say he observed *a few* squares.
* **D: Yuunitiiwwan organizimii hojjatan xixiqqoo argate (Found small units that carry out organism functions)** This is a later understanding of cells as the basic units of life.  Hooke didn't have this understanding; he simply observed the dead compartments.



"
Hiikni bu’uuraa jecha “seelii” jedhuu maalidha?,"The correct answer is **C: Caasaa yk istiraakcharii xiqqaa (Small structure)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Seeliin jecha laatinii seelaa jechuunis kutaa xiqqoo jechuunis irraa dhufee"" which translates to ""The word 'cell' comes from the Latin word 'cella' which means a small compartment/part.""
* The text goes on to describe cells as ""rog-arfee yookaan kubbaawwan xixiqqoo"" (small vesicles or tiny spheres) and ""koorkii keessatti arge"" (found in the cork).  This further supports the idea of a small, structured unit.
* Options A (Isquweeriwwan xixiqqoo - Small particles) and D (Kubbaawwan xixiqqoo - Tiny spheres) are too general.  While cells *can* be spherical, they are more accurately described as *structures* that perform specific functions.  Option B (Kutaa xiqqoo - Small part) is also correct, but option C is more precise in the context of biological structure.

Therefore, **C: Caasaa yk istiraakcharii xiqqaa** is the best fit based on the provided text.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bineensonni heddi dandeettii maal gochuu qabu?","The correct answer is **B: Socho’uu (To walk)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bineensonni baay’een socho’uu danda’u"" which translates to ""Many animals can walk.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Balali’uu (To cry/weep):** The text says animals can *cry*, but it highlights their ability to *walk* as a key characteristic.
* **C: Bishaan daakuu (To swim):** The text mentions animals can be in the water and can swim, but it doesn't focus on swimming as their primary ability.
* **D: Qotuu (To bite):** The text doesn't mention animals biting.

Therefore, based on the provided text, the most accurate answer is that many animals can walk.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bineensonni tokko tokko maal hin qabne?","The correct answer is **C: Sammuu (Pain)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bineeldota qofaatu sammuu qaba"" which translates to ""Only animals have pain."" The text also mentions that animals have internal organs, bones, and nerves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seeliwwan (Scales):** The text doesn't mention scales at all.
*   **B: Dandeettii nyaata bulleessuu (Ability to eat):** The text states that animals want to eat and can eat.
*   **D: Dandeettii nyaachuu (Ability to chew):** While animals eat, the text doesn't specifically mention the ability to chew."
Adeemsa footoosentesisii keessatti maaltu biqiloota gargaara?,"The correct answer is **D: Aduu**.

The text states: ""Biqiltoonni nyaata isaanii karaa footosentesisii aduu irraa qopheeffattu."" (Bacteria make their food through photosynthesis from sunlight.)

Photosynthesis is the process where plants and some bacteria use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food (sugars) and release oxygen.  Therefore, sunlight (aduu) is essential for this process.
"
Namoonni kan gara alaatti baasan biqiloonni ammoo gara keessatti kan fudhatan maalidha?,"The correct answer is **D: Kaarbondaayi oksaayidii (Carbon dioxide)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Biqiloonni Oksijiinii isa dhalli namaa keessa isaatti harganu Oomishu,kaarboondaayioksaayidii isa namni gadi baasu immo biqiloonni ni fayyaadamu.""  This translates to: ""Microorganisms produce oxygen that humans breathe, but microorganisms also use carbon dioxide that humans exhale.""

Therefore, microorganisms use carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of human respiration.  The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Nyaata (Food)** - While microorganisms need nutrients, the passage focuses on what they *use* from humans, not what they eat.
*   **B: Oksijiinii (Oxygen)** - Microorganisms produce oxygen, they don't primarily *need* it in the same way humans do.
*   **C: Bishaan (Water)** - While water is essential for life, the passage doesn't specifically mention microorganisms using water from humans.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, fakkeenyota armaan gadii keessaa adeemsa tirannaa kan daangessu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Gareewwan muraasni bakka haaratti milkaa’uu dhabuu (Some groups fail to settle in the Haar'a region)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how groups who *couldn't* effectively settle in the Haar'a region often came to see themselves as being ""more"" than their original region. This implies some groups *didn't* successfully settle there. The text then explains that the Haar'a region has abundant resources, leading to increased ambition. Option A directly reflects this initial difficulty in settling, which then fuels the desire for more.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Gareen hawaasa (population) tokkoo naannoo haaratti deemuu (One population settles in the Haar'a region):** While the text discusses population movement, it focuses more on the groups who *couldn't* settle *effectively* and the resulting ambition.
* **C: Hawaasni tokko naannoo haaraa keessatti yeroo madaquu isaa tolfatu (One group exhausts its time in the Haar'a region):** This isn't the primary focus of the text.
* **D: Hawaasni tokko yeroon booda lama ta’uu (One group becomes two later):** This option doesn't align with the core message of the text about ambition and seeking more resources.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa adeemsa sanyiin haaraa uumamuu (speciation) sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami? ,"The correct answer is **B: Adeemsa tiraannaa keessatti murteessadha (Speciation occurs through the process of anagenesis)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how Harar people, initially part of a larger group, became distinct due to their environment and unique adaptations. This process aligns with **anagenesis**, which is the gradual evolutionary change within a lineage over time.  

* **Anagenesis** is a type of evolution where populations change over generations, leading to differences that eventually make them distinct. This fits the description of Harar people developing unique traits and cultural practices in response to their environment, eventually differentiating themselves from their ancestors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo hawaasni tokko madaquu dadhabu uumama (When a population is separated)** This describes **allopatric speciation**, which is when populations become isolated geographically, leading to independent evolution. While isolation might have *contributed* to the Harar people's differentiation, the passage focuses on gradual changes *within* a lineage.
* **C: Sanyiin haaran uumamuu agarsiisa (Demonstrates the formation of Harar species)** The passage describes the *process* of the formation of Harar distinctiveness, not definitively stating that a new *species* was formed. The passage implies a unique adaptation and development of cultural characteristics which leads to a distinct group.
* **D: Uumamuun isaa waan hin oolledha (Its formation is not understood)** The passage *does* offer a perspective on how Harar distinctiveness formed, relating it to environmental adaptation and gradual changes over time.




"
Kutaa marsaa dhiigaa keessaa dhiiga gara onneetti kan geessu kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Artariiwwan (Arteries)**.

The passage states: ""Dhiigi ujummoowwan aarterii jedhamuun beekamaniin onnee keessaa kan ba’uu..."" which translates to ""Blood is known as arteries that come out of the heart...""

Therefore, arteries carry blood *away* from the heart.
"
Marsaa dhiigaa keessatti ujummoo kamtu xiqqaadha?,"The correct answer is **A: Kappilariiwwan (Capillaries)**.

The text states: ""Ujummoowwan hundarra xixiqqoon kaappilaaroota jedhamaniin onneetti kan ba’uu fi ujummoowwan veeyinii jedhamaniin gara onneetti kan deebi’udha.""  This translates to: ""All the blood vessels are small capillaries that carry blood into the body and veins that carry blood back to the body."" Therefore, capillaries are the smallest blood vessels.
"
Ilbiisonii baallee isaanii gara boodetti dachaasuu danda’uun isaanii kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu akka dabalu godha?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhiyeessii nyaataa (Food provision)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Ilbiisonni baalleesaanii dachaasuu hin dandeenye, titiisa diraagon fi titiisa-meey qofaadha."" This means older elephants can't run and are limited to walking slowly. The passage also mentions that ""Kun bineensa isaan balleessu jalaa dhokachuuf bakka ta’u xixiqqaa carraa guddaa waliin kenna.""  This implies that providing food is a way to help them survive and avoid threats.  

Therefore, providing food (dhiyeessii nyaataa) enables them to survive even with their limited mobility. The other options aren't as directly supported by the text:

*   **B: Bakka dhokannaa (Shelter):** While shelter is important, the passage focuses more on the immediate need for sustenance.
*   **C: Hiriyaa barbaaduu (Seeking companionship):**  The passage doesn't mention a need for companionship as a survival mechanism for older elephants.
*   **D: Saffisa balalii (Resting place):**  Resting is important, but the inability to run is primarily a limitation in movement, and providing food helps overcome this.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa dandeettii balalii ilbiisotaatin waanta dhiiban irra hin geenye kan kuticha keessatti hin eeramin kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Dandeettii (Ability)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that older elephants can no longer engage in the same kind of playful behavior as younger elephants (like sliding down hills with their bodies). They are limited to bathing in the river and mud wallows. This indicates a loss of the *physical ability* required for the more energetic play.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wal-hormaata (Respect):** The text doesn't mention anything about respect affecting the elephants' ability to play.
* **B: Umurii jiraatan (Age lived):** While age is *related* to the loss of ability, the text directly points to the decline in physical capacity.  The age itself isn't the reason for the limitation, it's what age *leads to* (reduced ability).
* **C: Soorata sassaabuu (Social structure):** The text doesn't discuss social dynamics as a factor in the elephants' play behavior.



Therefore, the limitation in physical *ability* is the reason the older elephants can no longer engage in the same playful activities.



"
Amaloota armaan gadii keessaa daayinoosaroota wajjin yeroo baay’ee kan wal-qabanne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Miila duuban deemuu (Thick neck)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Miilla foon jabaa fi qoronyoo qabu qabu, buphaa ni busuu, akkasumas miilla isaanii duubaatiin akka T-Reeksitti deemu."" This translates to: ""They have thick necks and strong legs, they can run and jump, and their necks resemble those of a T-Rex.""

Therefore, the characteristic mentioned in the text that relates to dinosaurs is a ""thick neck"".
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa amaloota simbirroonni fi daayinoosaroonni qaban kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Balali’uu danda’uu (Being able to swim)**.

Here's why:

The text states that *Simbira* are thought to have had characteristics of dinosaurs, including ""miilla foon jabaa fi qoronyoo qabu qabu, buphaa ni busuu, akkasumas miilla isaanii duubaatiin akka T-Reeksitti deemu"" (large fin and spines, and the ability to swim, and their fins could resemble a T-Rex's).

The text *doesn't* mention that they could swim. It specifically highlights their fin-like structures and how they resembled T-Rex fins, implying a different mode of locomotion, not swimming.  The other options are mentioned as features of the *Simbira*.



Therefore, the only option that is *not* mentioned as a characteristic of the *Simbira* (and is actually suggested to be absent) is swimming.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kutaa muka saayikad (cycad plant) Tirayisraatops (Triceratops) nyaachuu danda’an kami?","The correct answer is **A: Baala qaqalloo (Fronds)**.

The text states: ""Triceratoponni bikii isaa isa cimaa fayyadamuu ni danda’a ture baala irraa fudhuun osoo baalota tirankii isaa hin nyaatin."" This translates to: ""Triceratops could also use its fronds by feeding on the leaves without eating its trunk.""  Fronds are the leaves of cycad plants.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessa Tirayisraatops nyaachuu danda’u kami? ","The correct answer is **D: Biqiloota firii summaa’aa qaban (Cycads)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Saayintistootni muraasni akka yaadaniiti Triceratoponni akka cycadsin nyaataniti dha..."" which translates to ""Scientists believe that Triceratops ate cycads...""

Cycads are described as plants with cones that resemble pine cones. Therefore, option D is the accurate answer.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ispoortiwwan armaan gadii keessaa naannolee kaaba Xaaliyaanitti beekamaa kan ta’e kami?","The correct answer is **A: Kubbaa miilaa (Football)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Gareen kubbaa miillaa biyyaalessaa Xaaliyaanii fi gareen kubbaa miillaa biyyaalessaa Jarmanii addunyaa kana irratti gareewwan hunda caalaa milkaa’oo sadarkaa lammaffaa irratti argamanidha...""  (Football teams from the nations of Xaaliyaanii and Germany are among the top two nations in the world...). It also mentions the strong presence of football in the Arabian Peninsula, referencing the success of Xaaliyaanotni (Arabs) in the World Cup and Olympic Games.

While the text lists other sports, football is highlighted as the most prominent and successful, and directly linked to the Arabian Peninsula.
"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, ispoortiwwan armaan gadii keessaa Xaaliyaanin shaampiyoonii addunyaa kan ittiin taate kami?","The correct answer is **A: Kubbaa miilaa (Football)**.

The text explicitly states that the German national football team has achieved the highest level of success among all national teams, and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.  While the text mentions other sports Germany excels in, it specifically highlights football as their most successful.
"
Taatee kam booda kutaalen Lugzambarg muraasni Beeljiyeem ta’an?,"The correct answer is **B: Warraaqsa Beeljiyeem**.

The passage states: ""Baroota darbaanitti kutaa Beeljem ammaa kutaa Luuzeenbergi turan garuu bara 1830tti warraqsaa warraa Beeljemiin booda,kan Beeljem taasifame.""  This translates to: ""In the years past, the part of Luxembourg that was part of Belgium, in 1830, separated from the Belgian territory, and Belgium was established.""

Therefore, Luxembourg became part of Belgium and then separated from it in 1830.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa garee kamuu deeggaruu dhabuu (neutrality) Lukzambarg irratti dhiibbaa kan qabaate kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Biyya walabaa ta’uu (Being a neutral country)**.

The text explicitly states that Luxembourg maintained neutrality throughout history, even during both World Wars. This neutrality is a key aspect of its history and is why the other options are incorrect.

Here's why the other options are wrong:

* **A: Weerara Jarmanii (German occupation):** While Germany occupied Luxembourg during both World Wars, the text highlights Luxembourg's *maintaining* of neutrality *despite* the occupation.
* **B: Gamtaa Awurooppatti makamuu (Leaving the European Community):** Luxembourg became a founding member of the European Economic Community (now the European Union) in 1957, so it did *not* leave.
* **C: Warraaqsa Beeljiyeem (Belgian territory):** Luxembourg was once part of Belgium, but it gained independence and has maintained its own sovereignty."
Bal’ina Turkiin qabdu keessaa iskuweer kilomeetirii meeqatu Awurooppaa keessa jira?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""Naannoo Turkiitti, haroowwan dabalachuun, iskuweer kiloometiiri 783,562 qabata (300,948 sq mi), kan keessaa iskuweer kiloometirii 755,688 (291,773 sq mi) kan ta’u naannoo Eeshiyaa kibba lixaatti akkasuma iskuweer kiloometiri 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) kan ta’ummoo Awuurroppatit dha.""

This translates to: ""Within Turkey, excluding the peninsula, it has an area of 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 sq mi), of which 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 sq mi) is European.""
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Turkiin maayilii meeqa dheeratti?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The passage states: ""Daangaan Tuurkii kiiloo meetira 1600 (maayilii 1,000) caalaa dheerata..."" which translates to ""The length of Turkey is over 1600 kilometers (1,000 miles)...""
"
Magaala Vaatikaanif afaan Laatiinii maalif fayyada?,"The correct answer is **A: Sagantaalee amantii (Religious ceremonies)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Magaalaan Vaatikaan seera hiikuu fi quunnamtii seraatiif afaan Xaaliyanii fayyadamti. Afaan Xaaliyaniin kan namoota magaalitti keessa hojjetaniin baay’inaan fayyadamaamu dha Latiin ammo ayyanoota Amantiif fayyadamaamu dha."" This translates to: ""The Vatican City uses the Holy Latin language for religious ceremonies and official documents. While the Holy Language is mainly used by people working in the city, Latin is used by the clergy.""  Therefore, Latin is primarily used for religious ceremonies.
"
Vaatikaan keessatti afaan Xaaliyaanii kan dhimma itti hin bahamne maalifi?,"The correct answer is **D: Qunnamtii guyyuu keessatti (During the Christmas mass)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Latin is used for religious ceremonies and by those working in the Vatican. It also mentions that the Vatican uses the Holy Latin language for ceremonies and important events. While the other options (religious ceremonies, solemn religious gatherings) all fit within the general scope of Vatican activities, the passage doesn't explicitly state Latin *isn't* used during Christmas mass. It only emphasizes its use in *general* religious ceremonies.

Therefore, the question is looking for something that *isn't* mentioned as being used in the Vatican, and the Christmas mass is the least explicitly linked to Latin usage in the text.

So the answer is **D**.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa sagalee kompitaroota ammayyaarratti qindeessuu kan fayyadu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Muuziqaa (Music)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Muziqaan yeroo baay’ee kan waraabamuu koompiyuutara walxaxaa ta’an fayyadamuun adeemsaa fi sagalee walitti makuudhaani.""  This translates to: ""Music is frequently used with computers for services and connecting ideas.""

The question asks which of the options is *most* frequently used with computers for services and connecting ideas, based on the text.  Music is explicitly linked to this use.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Animeeshinii (Animation):** While animation can be done on computers, the passage doesn't emphasize its frequent use for ""services and connecting ideas"" as much as music.
* **C: Fakkiiwwan (Pictures):** Similar to animation, pictures are created on computers but not highlighted as a primary tool for the described purposes.
* **D: Ijaarsa (Design/Arrangement):**  This is too broad. While design *can* be done on a computer, the passage specifically mentions music's role in ""services and connecting ideas"".



Therefore, **Music** is the best answer based on the information provided."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, manneen hedduun mana fincaanii bishaan ofiin qabu ykn dhangalaasu qaban bakka kamitti argamaniidha?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daaro**.

The text explicitly states: ""Magaaalonni Haarappaa fi Moohenjoo-daroo mana fincaan booliitti bishaan naqamu... kan sirna balfa dhangala’aa walxaxaa walxaxaa ta’een wal agarsiifame mana hunda keessaa qabu turan.""  This translates to ""The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had houses with private bathrooms...""

While other locations are mentioned as having bathhouses, Mohenjo-daro is the *only* place directly stated to have houses *with private bathrooms*.
"
Bakkeewwan armaan gadii keessaa malli balfa gatuu ammayyaa kan itti argamu kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappaa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Magaaalonni Haarappaa fi Moohenjoo-daroo mana fincaan booliitti bishaan naqamu, kan sirna balfa dhangala’aa walxaxaa walxaxaa ta’een wal agarsiifame mana hunda keessaa qabu turan."" This translates to: ""The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had houses with drainage systems that were interconnected, showing a sophisticated sanitation system.""

The other options are mentioned as having sanitation systems, but the text specifically highlights Harappa and Mohenjo-daro as examples of early cities with this feature.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa nama iskeetii yapahatu akka garagalu kan godhu kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Fiixewwan lamaan gabatee iskeetii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""yoo iskeetiin gara mirgaatti jallate, gara mirgaatti goora, yoo iskeetiin gara bitaatti gore, gara bittaatti gora."" This translates to: ""If the skate is tight on the ankle, it rubs on the ankle, and if it's tight on the instep, it rubs on the instep.""

The question asks what helps prevent blisters from forming when wearing new skates.  The text then mentions that blisters occur when the skate rubs on the ankle or instep.  Therefore, something that prevents this rubbing would prevent blisters.

The text specifically says ""Fiixewwan lamaan gabatee iskeetii"" which translates to ""The two pieces of the skate lining"" are what are involved in this rubbing. These pieces are the parts that can be adjusted to make the skate fit more comfortably and prevent pressure points.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Karvii xiqqaa gabatee iskeetii gajjallaarratti argamu (Small metal pieces found in tight skates):** While these *might* contribute to discomfort, the text doesn't directly link them to preventing blisters. They might cause blisters.
*   **C: Dandeettii walii galaa nama iskeetii tapahatuu (The skill of someone who wears skates):** Skill doesn't prevent blisters; it just helps you skate better.
*   **D: Qulqullina cabbii (Skate cleanliness):** Cleanliness doesn't prevent blisters.

The passage states: ""Haadduun iskeetii cabbii kan hammayyaa irra jiru fiixa dachaa dhooqa koonkeevii isaan jidduu kan qabu dha."" This translates to: ""The haadduun (a type of tool) that is placed on top of the broad cabbage has two concaves (dhooqa koonkeevii) in the middle.""

The question asks what the passage states about the two concaves on the good cabbage cutter.  The passage explicitly says they are ""konkeevii"" (concaves).

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, adeemsi atamoonni (atoms) anniisaa hamma barbaadamuu olii ifa keessaa akka badu godhu maalidha?","The correct answer is **B: Hurka footoniwwanii socho’e (stimulated emission)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that atoms emit photons (light) when they transition to a lower energy state.  However, it states that the *frequency* of these photons is related to the energy difference between the states.  

The question asks *how* atoms can emit light at a higher frequency (more energy) than they would naturally. This is where stimulated emission comes in.

* **Stimulated emission** is the process where an incoming photon triggers an atom to emit another photon of the *same* frequency, phase, and direction. This is the basis of lasers. It allows for amplification of light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Carallaa (Spontaneous emission):** This is the natural emission of a photon when an atom decays to a lower energy state, and it occurs randomly. It doesn't explain how light could be at a higher frequency than naturally emitted.
* **C: Footoonii (Photon):** A photon is a particle of light, not a process that explains *how* atoms emit light at a higher frequency.
* **D: Hurka carallaa socho’e (Unstimulated emission):** This is essentially the same as spontaneous emission.



"
Atamiin footoonii akka gadi lakkisu maaltu godha?,"The correct answer is **A: Anniisaa hamma barbaadamuu ol ta’e gadi lakkisuu (Absorbs all the energy it receives)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Suuraan itti aanu atomoonni yeroo footoonii gad lakkissan mullisa.""  This translates to ""Therefore, atoms absorb the photons they encounter.""  And it further explains that atoms absorb the energy from photons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sochii ifa guddaan uumame (Created from intense light)** - The passage describes photons *as* light, but doesn't say they are *created* from it.
* **C: Sadarkaa ifaa tasgabbaa’aa hin taane (Not a concentrated beam of light)** - The passage clarifies that photons are individual packets of energy, not a beam.
* **D: Carrallaadhaf ri’aakshinii namatti hin tolle (adverse) agarsiisuu (Show adverse reaction to radiation)** - While radiation can have adverse effects, the passage focuses on the *absorption* of photons.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ampuulin ibsaa akka hin hojjanne malti taasisa?","The correct answer is **C: Filaamentiin ampuulii keessa jiru gubachuu.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kunis sababni isaa gaafa Elektirikiin gara sookeetiiti deemu balbiin gari Sibiila isaa ibsaan akka si keessa darbu gochuu danda’u yoo keessoo sookeetii tuqxe yookiin qaama balbicha keessa isaa sibiila osoodhumaa inni sokeetii keessa jiru."" This translates to: ""This is because the electrical current that comes from the socket can pass through the glass envelope of the bulb if you remove the socket or if you touch the metal part inside the bulb while the socket is plugged in.""

The text also says ""Baalbiin ifaa bakka buusuu barbaada"" (The light bulb needs to be fixed), and further explains that the filament inside the bulb can be broken, causing it to not work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fiiksichariin ifaa sirnaan banamuu dhabuu** (The light fixture's wiring has disconnected): While a disconnected fixture *could* prevent the bulb from working, the text focuses on the bulb itself.
* **B: Sibiila ampuulii qofaa walakkaan sokkeettitti galchuu** (Just put the bulb's glass envelope and filament into the socket):  This isn't a cause of the bulb not working; it's how you *install* it.
* **D: Yaa’i elektirikii gara sokkeetii deemu gadi deemuu ykn xiqqaataa deemuu** (The electrical wire that comes from the socket has come loose or broken): Similar to option A, this is a potential cause but the text specifically points to the filament.



"
Yeroo ampuulii ibsaa jijjiiran kanneen armaan gadii keessaa tuquun balaa kan qabu kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Filaamentii**.

Here's why:

* **Filaamentii (Filament):**  This is the thin wire inside an incandescent light bulb that glows when electricity passes through it. It's the part that gets extremely hot and can cause burns if touched, especially if the bulb is broken.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *primary* hazard when a bulb is broken:

* **Bantuu fi cuftuu (Base and contact):** While sharp, the base and contacts are less likely to pose a severe burn risk compared to the hot filament.
* **Gajjaallaa ampuulii (Glass of the bulb):** Broken glass is certainly dangerous (cuts), but the immediate burn risk isn't as significant as the hot filament.
* **Keebilii (Wire):** The wires are inside the bulb and not the primary source of immediate danger when the bulb breaks.

The passage itself emphasizes the danger of the hot filament when a bulb breaks, connecting it to the warning about not touching the inside of a socket.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo nikulasiin gargar cabu maaltu uumama?","The correct answer is **C: Atamiiwwan tasgabbaa’uu dhabu** (Atoms lose their ability to be stable).

Here's why:

The text states that when a nucleus loses neutrons, it is ""gargar qooduun humna sana muraasa akka lakkisu taasisa"" - meaning it causes the number of neutrons to be reduced.  It also says that atoms have a specific number of protons and neutrons, and this number determines the atom's identity (how it behaves).  Removing neutrons disrupts this balance, leading to the atom losing its stability – it's no longer a neutral, stable atom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pirotooniwwantu argama** (Protons are detected) - While protons are present in the nucleus, removing neutrons doesn't *create* protons.
*   **B: Anniisan gadi lakkifama** (Neutrons are counted) - The text implies the number of neutrons is *reduced*, not counted.
*   **D: Niwutirooniwwan ni badu** (Neutrons are released) - The text implies neutrons are *lost* (gargar qoodu), but it doesn't explicitly state they are released as separate particles. They are part of the nucleus.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa bilbila fageenyarraa gara Dacheetti deebi’uu kan ibsu kami,"The correct answer is **B: Saatalaayitiiwwan (Satellites)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saatalaayitiin hawaarra jiru sun bilbila akkuma fuudheen hatattamaan gara lafaatti as deebisa.""  This translates to: ""Satellites in space reflect light as if it were thrown back to Earth.""  This directly indicates that satellites are what reflect the light from Earth back to us, thus signaling the Earth's location.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Teleskoppiiwwan (Telescopes):** Telescopes *observe* the light, but they don't *reflect* it back to indicate location. They are used to study the light from other sources.
* **C: Ifa (Light):** Light itself doesn't signal location.  It's the *reflection* of light that reveals something.
* **D: Rookkeettiwaan (Rockets):** Rockets are used to *launch* satellites and telescopes, not to signal Earth's location.



"
Kanneen keessaa teleskoppii gara hawaatti erguuf kan gargaaru kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Rookkeettiwaan (Rockets)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hawaa irra saatalaayitii yookiin teeleskooppii kaa’uuf rookeetii guddaa fitii 100 ol dheeratu barbaachisa.""  This translates to: ""To place a satellite or telescope in the air, a very large rocket is needed, more than 100 feet tall.""

Therefore, rockets are the necessary tool to launch telescopes into the atmosphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bissii ifaa (Light beam):** While light is involved in telescopes, the question asks about what *launches* them.
*   **C: Atimosferii lafaa (Earth's atmosphere):** The atmosphere is *affected* by telescopes and satellites but isn't what launches them. It's a barrier they need to overcome.
*   **D: Saatalaayitiiwwan ijjata miilaa 100 lafarraa ol fagaatan (Satellites that orbit more than 100 miles above the Earth):**  The question asks what helps *launch* telescopes, not what the telescopes themselves are.



"
Sa’aatin darbuu isaa baruuf waa’ee taatee marsaan deebi’uu (cyclical event) kamtu hubatamuu qaba?,"The correct answer is **B: Irra deddeebii (Equinox)**.

Here's why:

The text discusses how the Earth's seasons are a cyclical event. It mentions that we observe these seasons regularly. The question asks for a specific cyclical event. The equinox is a key cyclical event related to the seasons, marking the times when the sun crosses the celestial equator, resulting in roughly equal daylight and nighttime hours.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Turtii (Summer)** - This is a season, not a cyclical event *of* seasons.
*   **C: Dhiibbaa (Winter)** - Same as summer, winter is a season.
*   **D: Rakkisaa ta’uu (The sun’s rising)** - While the sun rising is a daily event, it doesn't represent the cyclical change of seasons.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, taatee tokko maal isaa madaaluf yeroo ykn sa’aatii kan fayyadamnu?","The correct answer is **B: Irra deddeebii (Reflection)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the importance of reflection (""irradeddeebii"") as a way to understand the past and learn from it. It states that by reflecting on past events, we can gain insight and make sense of them. The text also mentions that reflection should be done regularly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dheerina (Long time)** - While the text mentions a long time (thousands of years) in relation to historical knowledge, it's not the *process* of understanding, but a timeframe.
*   **C: Muuxannoo (Study/Learning)** - The text mentions studying, but it specifically highlights reflection as the key to understanding.
*   **D: Dhiibbaa (Peace/Quiet)** - Peace and quiet can be conducive to reflection, but they aren't the act of reflection itself.

Therefore, reflection (""irradeddeebii"") is the most accurate answer to the question of what we should use time for, according to the text."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa nama gonfoo dhaalu tokko addatti kan ilaallatu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Digrii 2:2 argachuu (Getting a 2:2 degree)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Booda immoo seenaa itti barate deeme qabxii 2:2 argachuun (digirii gita lammaffaa gad aanaa)."" which translates to ""Later, after studying history, he got a 2:2 degree (a lower second class degree).""

The question asks what specifically the passage highlights as a potential obstacle to a successful career in the British Civil Service.  The passage directly connects the 2:2 degree with his later career path. The other options are either not mentioned in the text or are incorrect interpretations of the text.



"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, Chaarlas maal gochuudhaf nama jalqabaa ture?","The correct answer is **A: osoo mana baruumsaa hin xumurin waraanatti makamuu** (To join the war without completing his studies).

The passage states: ""Akka aadaatti, dhaalaan teessoo aangoo erga barumsa fixee kallattumaan gara humna waraanaa deema.""  This translates to: ""He (Charles) left his studies and joined the war after completing a certain amount of training.""

The passage also mentions that he later obtained a 2:2 degree (a lower second class degree) from Trinity College, Cambridge.  The question asks what he initially *went* to do based on the information provided.  The key information is that he left his studies to join the war. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.
"
Doonin Tiraayigvaasan (Trygvasson) biyya kam irraayi?,"The correct answer is **D: Noorweey**.

The text states: ""Olaaf Tiraayigivassooniin hogganame, nama Norweeyii kan biyya isaa to’annaa warra Deenmaark jalaa deebisee baasuuf abjuu qabuudha."" This translates to: ""Led by Olaf Tryggvason, he had the ambition to drive out the Danes from his homeland, the Norwegians.""
"
Seenaa keessatti Jarman dhiibbaa aadaa cimaa Istooniyaa irratti kan geessiste yoomi?,"The correct answer is **C: Naannoo waggaa 600 dura (600 years ago)**.

The text states: ""Naannoo jarraa 15ffaatti, Istooniyaan kaabaa dhiibbaa aadaan guddaa Jarmanii jala turte."" This translates to ""In the 15th century, Estonia accepted the peace offering of the great German war.""  Since the 15th century is approximately 600 years ago (from the time the text was written), option C is the most accurate.
"
Afaan Istooniyaa maalidhaan dhiibban irra gahe?,"The correct answer is **B: qubee ykn alfaabeetii Jarmanii (the German alphabet)**.

The text states: ""Akkuma yeroon darba deemen, jechootni hedduun kan beektoota Jeermanii irra ergifatame. Yericha yeroo jalqabaa qaroomina ture."" which translates to ""As time passed, many words were borrowed from the Germans. In the beginning, the writing was rudimentary."" This implies that the Estonian alphabet was initially based on or heavily influenced by the German alphabet. The text also mentions the ""Õ/õ"" character, which is a specific character within the Estonian alphabet, a modification of the German one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qubee Õ/õ (The Õ/õ character):** While ""Õ/õ"" is part of the Estonian alphabet, it's not the *reason* the language gained prominence or was established. It's just a characteristic of the alphabet itself.
*   **C: Moloqseewwan Jarmanii (German monasteries):** The text doesn't mention monasteries, nor is there any connection to monasteries influencing the language.
*   **D: Waaqayyo (God):** While the German missionaries wanted to spread their faith, the text isn't saying that God *caused* the language to be established. It's about the creation of the alphabet to facilitate the missionaries' goals.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, lakkoofsi namoota Hindii jalqaba (native Hindi) dubbatanii kan daddaaqu sababa maalii irratti hundaa’eti?","The correct answer is **A: Loqodi Hindiitti baay’ee dhiyaatu lakkaa’amaa jira yoo ta’e** (The fact that many people speak Hindi is counted).

The passage states: ""Dubbattoota miliyoona 340 hanga 500tti tilmaamaman, fi namoota haga miliyoona 800 ta’an afaanicha hubachuu dandayan."" (340 to 500 million people speak it, and up to 800 million people can understand it.) This indicates the large number of Hindi speakers is the basis for the count.

While options B, C, and D are related, they aren't the primary reason for the count as described in the passage. The passage explicitly focuses on the number of speakers and understanders.
"
Waa’ee afaan Hindii fi Urduu ilaalchisee himoota armaan gadii keessaa kamtu sirriidha?,"The correct answer is **C: Jechoota fi barreeffamaan lachuu wal fakkaatu (Words and phrases are similar)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Afaan Hindii fi Urduun galmee jechootan walfakkaatoodha garuu barreeffamaan adda adda;"" which translates to ""Hindi and Urdu share a common vocabulary but are grammatically different.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Namoota afaan lachuu dubbatan gidduu yeroo baay’ee walitti dhufeenyi hin jiru (Speakers of the language rarely interact)** - The text doesn't say this. It focuses on the linguistic similarities despite limited daily interaction.
* **B: Barreeffamaan garaa gari (Highly similar grammar)** - The text specifically states the grammar is *different*.
* **D: Jechaan gargari (Slang words)** - The text doesn't mention slang.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the information provided in the text."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee qubee Hanguwel dhugaa sirrii kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Maqaan jalqabaa qubichaa Hunan Jeongeum jedhama ture.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Jalqabumati haala qubee Hanguwel kan inni itti moggaase Hunmin Jeongeum jedheti, kana jechuunis “sagaleewwan sirrii namaaf qajeelfamaa kennuuf”.""  This directly translates to ""The original name of the Hangeul alphabet was Hunmin Jeongeum, meaning 'the correct way to instruct people in the words'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yeroo Mootii Sejong aangotti bahu gara jalqabaa uumame:** While King Sejong was instrumental in creating Hangeul, the passage says it was created during his reign (1418-1450), not that it was the first thing he did upon gaining power.
*   **C: Mootii afraffaa Daayinaastii Jaaseonin uumame:** The passage explicitly states that Hangeul was created during the Joseon Dynasty, not the Goryeo Dynasty.
*   **D: Itti yaadamee uumame:** The passage indicates that it was created during King Sejong's reign, implying it was intentionally designed. It wasn't created after the fact.



"
Qubeen ykn alfaabeetin Hunan Jeongeum yeroon booda maalitti jijjiirame?,"The correct answer is **B: Hanguwel**.

The text states: ""Jalqabumati haala qubee Hanguwel kan inni itti moggaase Hunmin Jeongeum jedheti..."" which translates to ""The official name of the alphabet that it was based on is Hanguwel...""

Therefore, Hanguwel is the name of the alphabet that Hunmin Jeongeum evolved into.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, afaanota kamtu saanskiriitidhaan dhiibban irra gahe?","The correct answer is **B: Afaanota Awurooppaa (European languages)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Saaniskiriit afaan durduriiti, afaan Laatiinii isa Awurooppaa keessatti dubbatamuun kan walfakkeeffamuu danda’udha.""  This translates to: ""Sanskrit is an ancient language, and Latin, which is spoken in Europe, can be connected to it.""  The passage goes on to explain that Sanskrit is a source language for many Indian languages, similar to how Latin is a source language for European languages like French and Spanish.

Therefore, European languages are the ones that descended from Sanskrit.
"
"Akaataa kutichaatti, afaan Saanskiriit fayyadamuun kan bade sababa maalitiini?","The correct answer is **A: Wal-xaxaa ta’uusaa (Its richness and versatility)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Saaniskiriitiin afaan baay’ee walxaxaa fi badhaadhaadha, kan afaanota Hindii ammayyaa baay’eef akka maddaatti tajaajile, akkuma Laatiin madda afaanota Awurooppaa kan akka Fireenchii fi Ispaanishii ta’e.""  This translates to: ""Sanskrit is a very rich and versatile language, which served as the root for many Indian languages, just as Latin served as the root for the European languages like French and Spanish.""

While the other options are related to Sanskrit, they don't explain *why* it was so influential. 

* **B: Godaansa Ariyaan (Aryan migration)** is a *reason* for the spread of Sanskrit, not *why* it became so influential.
* **C: Afaanota Laatiinii (Latin languages)** are examples of languages derived from Latin, not the reason for Sanskrit's influence.
* **D: Caaseffama (The Upanishads)** are important texts written in Sanskrit, but don't explain its inherent qualities.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, harkisa lo irra jiru ilaalchisee kanneen armaan gadii keessaa himni sirriin kami?","The correct answer is **A: Harkisa lo caalaa harkisa lafaa ni xiqqata (The weight of the earth is less than the weight of the moon).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Namni lafa irratti paawondii 200 (kiiloo giraama 90) ulfaatu lo irratti paawundii 36 (kiiloo giraamii 16) ulfaatu.""  This means a person weighs 200 pounds on Earth but only 36 pounds on the Moon.

The key takeaway is that Earth's gravity is much stronger than the Moon's.  Therefore, the weight of the Earth (which is the force of gravity) is greater than the weight of the Moon. Option A accurately reflects this: Earth's gravity (weight) is less than the Moon's gravity (weight).

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Harkisni lo caalmatti harkisa, sababni ulfaatina xiqqaa qabaattus kanaafi (The Moon has weight, the reason for less weight is because of less mass).**  While the Moon *does* have mass and thus has gravity, the core point isn't about the mass directly causing the difference. It's the *strength* of the gravity that's different. The mass is a factor in determining the gravity, but the passage isn't explaining the reason for the weight difference solely based on mass.
* **C: Harakisni lo caalmatti ofitti harkisa, sababni ulfaatina guddaa qabaattus kanaafi (The Moon has weight itself, the reason for greater weight is because of greater gravity).**  This is incorrect. The passage explicitly states the person weighs *less* on the Moon, meaning the Moon's gravity is weaker.
* **D: Harkisa lo caalaa harkisa lafaatu caalmatti ofitti si harkisa (The weight of the Earth is greater than the weight of the Moon itself).** While true, this isn't the primary point of the passage. The passage is showing the difference in *weight between a person on Earth and on the Moon* as a result of the differing gravitational forces.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that correctly reflects the core meaning of the passage."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, himoota armaan gadii keessaa kutaa Addeessaa gara alaa sirriitti kan ibsu kami?","The correct answer is **B: Dirri bakka olko’aa jalatti haphiidha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bakkee ol ka’aa diriiraa jalatti haphii, garreen jalatti immoo furdaadha."" This translates to: ""In the elevated areas, the crust is thin, while in the valleys, it is thick.""

Option B directly reflects this information. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Garri dhiyoo jiru dirra furdaa (thicker crust) qaba:** The passage says valleys have thicker crust, not the deep-sea trenches.
* **C: Gara achi fagaatun maariyaa xiqqaatu jira ta’a:** The passage doesn't mention the presence of a mantle.
* **D: Bakka olka’aa jalatti maariyaa xiqqaatu jiraachuu mala:** The passage says the crust is thin in elevated areas, not the mantle.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, dirri Addeessaa bakka kamitti furdaadha?","The correct answer is **C: Bakka olka’aa jala** (On the highland).

The passage states: ""Bakkee ol ka’aa diriiraa jalatti haphii, garreen jalatti immoo furdaadha."" This translates to: ""In the highland, it is cold, but in the lowlands, it is hot."" The question asks where the river flows out in the Addeessa region. The passage indicates the river flows out in the highlands.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa namoota tokko tokkoon kana amanamu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Dhalli namaa urjiiwwan biroorra qubate (Human birth obtained energy from other sources)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the vast amount of energy involved in human life.** It mentions ""trillions of miles"" and the incredible journey of our ancestors.  This points to a massive energy input.
* **The question asks which statement supports the passage's claims.** The passage *implies* that humans don't create all the energy needed for life on their own.  Instead, they rely on energy derived from external sources.  This aligns with the idea that human birth obtained energy from other sources, implying a source beyond just the organism itself.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Dhalli namaa addunyaa ykn hawaa biroo bira gahuu hin danda’u (Human birth cannot go to another world or atmosphere)** - This is directly contradicted by the passage's mention of ancestors coming from ""other worlds.""
    * **C: Pilaanetiwwan biroorra lubbu qabeeyyin jiru (There are intelligent beings on other planets)** - While the passage mentions intelligent life on other planets, it's not the primary supporting argument for the energy aspect.
    * **D: Urjiilee giduu fageenya maayilii tiriliyoona hedduu gaditu jira (Primary energy sources are trillions of miles away)** - This is true, but it doesn't necessarily explain *where* that energy comes from or how it's utilized during human birth. The passage focuses on the energy needed for life itself, not just its source.

Therefore, option A best reflects the underlying point of the passage about the incredible energy needs of life and its reliance on sources beyond itself."
Wiirtuu ifaarraa hamma fagaataa deemtu maaltu haphataa deema?,"The correct answer is **A: Pilaasmaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Aduun guutummaan ishee gaasii, ibiddaafi pilaazmaa irraa tolfamte."" (The sun is completely made of gas, fire, and plasma.)  It also implies that the light we see from the sun is due to the plasma.

Therefore, plasma is the substance that emits the light we see. The other options are incorrect:

*   **Abidda (Fire):** While the sun *is* incredibly hot, it's not simply ""fire"" in the way we typically understand it. It's plasma, which is a superheated state of matter.
*   **Gaazii (Gas):**  The sun *is* made of gas, but not the gas that directly produces the visible light.
*   **Dirra (Crust):** The sun doesn't have a crust. It's a sphere of plasma.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, qaama aduu kam lafarra dhaabatanii mul’ata?","The correct answer is **C: Footoosfiirii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Qaamni bakkee kan Aduu ilaalu nuti arginu footosfeer jedhamu, “kubbaa ifaa” jechuu dha.""  This directly translates to: ""The part of the Sun we see is called the atmosphere, which is called the 'ball of fire'.""

The atmosphere (specifically the photosphere) is the visible surface of the Sun.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dirra (Corona):**  The corona is the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere, and it's not what we directly see as the Sun's surface.
* **B: Pilaasmicha (Plasma):**  Plasma is a state of matter found within the Sun, but it's not the layer we directly observe.
* **D: Wiirtuu (Solar flares):** Solar flares are sudden releases of energy, not the surface itself.
"
Ilaalcha armaan gadii keessaa tiyoorii Kopparnikas kan deegaruuf kan gargaaru kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Tiraaniziitii Veenasii**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Marsaaleen kan uumaman sababa gartokkeen Veenus (ykn kan Addeessaa) inni gara aduutti gara galee jiru qofatti ifti itti baheefidha. Marsaawwan addeessaa kun tiyooriii Koopparniikas isa pilaaneetonni aduutti marsu jedhu deeggara.""  This translates to: ""The reason for the appearance of the planet Veenus (or the Addeessaa) is only due to the bright reflection of the sun's rays. These Addeessaa planets validated the theory of Copernicus that planets revolve around the sun.""

* **Tiraaniziitii Veenasii (Venus Transit):**  This is the phenomenon where Venus passes directly between the Sun and Earth, appearing as a small black disk moving across the Sun's face.  Copernicus's heliocentric model *predicted* that Venus transits should occur.  The *observation* of these transits, which happened in the 18th and 19th centuries, provided strong evidence supporting his theory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gulantaalee Veenasii (Observations of Venus):** While observing Venus was important (as the passage mentions), it wasn't the *specific observation* that validated Copernicus's theory.  Observations of Venus's phases (like the Moon) were also crucial, but the text focuses on transits.
* **C: Wal-fakkeenya Aduu Veenasii waliin (Observation of Venus with the Sun):** This is too vague.  The *transit* is a specific observation related to Venus and the Sun.
* **D: Wal-fakkeenya Aduu Addeessa waliin (Observation of Venus with other planets):** The passage doesn't mention observing Venus *with other planets*. The key was the transit *with the Sun*.



Therefore, the passage directly connects the observation of **Tiraaniziitii Veenasii** with the validation of Copernicus's heliocentric theory.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa bara 1610 tti Galiiliyoo Galiiledhaan kan argame kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Gulantaalee Veenasii (Phases of Venus)**.

The passage explicitly states that Galileo used his telescope in 1610 to observe Venus and saw it had phases, similar to the moon. This observation was a key piece of evidence supporting Copernicus's heliocentric theory.

The text explicitly states: ""Amaazoon addunyaa irratti dheerinaan lammaffaa fi laga guddaa ta’uun beekama."" which translates to ""Amazon is known for being the largest rainforest in the world.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Laga guddicha** (The oldest forest): While the Amazon is very old, the text doesn't highlight its age as its defining characteristic.
* **C: Laga dheerinaan tokkoffaadha** (It is the largest forest alone): The text mentions it's known for being both the largest rainforest *and* the largest river basin.
* **D: Laga bal’inaan tokkooffaadha** (It is the largest river basin alone):  The text mentions both its rainforest and river basin aspects.

Seektara hojii kuticha keessatti eerame kamtu lammiilee Venezuweelaa lakkoofsan baay’ee xiqqaa ta’an qacara?,"The correct answer is **D: Tajaajila (Services)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Veenzuweelonni harki lama sadaffaaan kan sektara tajaajilaa keessa hojjetan..."" which translates to ""Venezuelans work in the service sector in two-thirds..."" This indicates that a large portion of the Venezuelan workforce is employed in the service sector. The question asks which sector employs the *least* number of Venezuelans. Since the service sector employs the most, the other options (Industry, Mining, and Agriculture) must employ fewer. While the text mentions difficulties in the industry, it doesn't state that industry employs the fewest. Therefore, the service sector is the most likely candidate for employing the fewest Venezuelans compared to the others.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, seektaroota hojii armaan gadii keessaa lammiilee Venezuweelaa lakkoofsa guddaa kan qacaru kami?","The correct answer is **A: Tajaajila (Services)**.

The text states: ""Veenzuweelonni harki lama sadaffaaan kan sektara tajaajilaa keessa hojjetan..."" which translates to ""Venezuelans work in the service sector in two-thirds..."".  This indicates the service sector employs the largest portion of the Venezuelan workforce.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, fiyuzhiniin ykn walitti hidhuun urjileen akka maal godhan gargaara?","The correct answer is **C: Ifaa fi hoo’insa kenna (Provides light and heat)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that nuclear fusion (or atomic fusion) is the process of combining hydrogen atoms to create heavier elements, releasing a huge amount of energy. This energy is primarily released as light and heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Elementiiwwan ulfaatoo uuma (Creates heavier elements):** While fusion *does* create heavier elements, the primary output and what's being emphasized in the passage is the energy release.
* **B: Wal-nyaatinsa fuyuzhinii ijaaruu (Reduces the fusion reaction's stability):** This is incorrect. Fusion is the *process* that releases energy; it doesn't reduce stability; it *is* the stability of the resulting element.
* **D: Atamiiwwan hayidiroojiinii uuma (Creates hydrogen atoms):** Fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, it doesn't create them.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the core information in the passage is that fusion provides light and heat.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa wal-nyaatinsi fiyuzhinii fayidaa qabu kan uumu kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Urjiiwwan (Energy)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses nuclear fusion as a way to create energy. It mentions combining hydrogen atoms to create heavier elements, releasing a massive amount of energy in the process. The ultimate goal of fusion research is to harness this energy source.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hayidiroojiinii (Hydrogen)** - Hydrogen is a *component* of the fusion process, not the benefit itself.
* **C: Atamiiwwan (Atoms)** - While fusion involves atoms, the primary benefit is the energy released.
* **D: Anniisaa (To be alive/To live)** - This is completely unrelated to the topic of nuclear fusion.



"
Bishaan keemikaala maalirraa uumama?,"The correct answer is **D: Atamii hayidiroojiinii lamaa fi atamii oksijiinii tokko**.

The text states: ""Kompaawundiin bishaan irraa hojjatame atomiiwwan haayidiroojiinii lamaa fi atomii ooksijiinii tokkodha.""  (The compound derived from the five atoms has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.)
"
"Bishaan yommuu foormii isaa jijjiiru, osoo hin jijjiiramin kan hafu maalidha?","The correct answer is **C: Sadarkaa fiizikaalaa** (Physical state).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yooma haalli fiizikaalawaan isaa jijjiirame iyyuu, haalli keemikaalawaan isaa immoo akkuma duraaniitti ta’a.""  This translates to: ""Even if its physical state changes, its chemical state remains the same.""

* **Physical state** (like gas, liquid, or solid) is a physical property. It's how the substance looks and behaves under certain conditions. It can change with temperature and pressure.

* **Chemical state** (what the molecule *is* - like H2O or CO2) is defined by the arrangement of atoms and the chemical bonds between them.  This doesn't change when the physical state changes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Caasaa molokiyuulii (Molecular gas):**  While the passage mentions molecular gases, the question asks what *doesn't* change when the form changes. The molecular gas *itself* doesn't change.
* **B: Rukkina (Aggregates/Clusters):** This refers to how molecules group together, not the fundamental identity of the molecule.
* **D: Naayitiroojiinii dhangala’aa (Nitrogenous gas):**  This is a *type* of molecule, not a general property.



Therefore, only the physical state remains unchanged when the form of a substance is altered.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, naannolee kudha sadi keessatti seerota tokko tokko hojiirra oolchuf yaalamu kanneen armaan gadii keessaa rakkoo kan hin turre kami?","The correct answer is **D: Hoji raawwachiiftuu biyyoolessaa kan hin jirre (Lack of inter-state enforcement power)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Akkasumas aangoo ittiin seera gibiraa naannoowwan gidduu jiran ittiin irra tarkaanfatu hin qabu ture."" This translates to ""Furthermore, they did not have the power to enforce laws between the states.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Angawoota naannoo irraa to’annaa cimaa (Significant power from state governments):** The passage argues the *opposite* - that state governments were weak and unable to effectively enforce laws.
* **B: Hanqina aangoo kongiresii keessatti (Restriction of congressional power):** While there was restriction, the primary issue was the lack of enforcement power *between* states, not a restriction on the Congress's power itself.
* **C: Tumaawwan seeraa sagalee guutun ragga’uu gaafatan (Multi-state legislative agreements):** The passage doesn't focus on the existence or lack of legislative agreements. The core problem was enforcement.



Therefore, the lack of inter-state enforcement power is the most directly supported reason in the passage for the difficulties faced by the early United States.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo Waraana Warraaqsaa sadarkaa mootummaa giduu galeessaa himni sirriitti ibsu kami?","The correct answer is **B: Keewwatoota irratti jijjiirama gochuun aangoo Kongiresii irratti hirkata ture.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Keewwatoonni hayyama nama hin beekamnee bulchiinsota hundarra osoo hin foyya’in fi bulchiinsonni mootummaa giddu galeessaa salphisanii fudhachuun bakka buutonni isaani irra dedebiin hafaa turani."" 

This translates to: ""Without using the power of the states or the federal government, the delegates joined together and forced the power of the Congress.""

This directly indicates that the delegates (who were the key players in the Confederacy) used pressure and coordination *against* the power of the Congress to achieve their goals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gibirri Kongiresii fi aangawootan akka hojiirra oolu godhame** - The passage explicitly says the Congress was *not* functioning effectively.
* **C: Bakka bu’oonni naannolee bakka bu’ummaa hin qaban ture** - While the passage mentions states lacking power to enforce inter-state laws, it doesn't connect this directly to the delegates' actions *against* Congress.
* **D: Mootummaan giduu galeessaa wantoota of keessati qabate** - The passage describes the federal government as weak and unable to enforce its laws.



"
Jechoonni dugda Labsa Walabummaa (Declaration of Independence) irratti akkamitti barreeffaman?,"The correct answer is **C: Gadi garagalee (Inscribed)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jechi duuba Labsii Bilisummaa irratti barreeffamee ture “Labsii Bilisummaa Jalqabaa Adooolessa gaafa 4, 1776” tidha. Barreeffamichi kan argamu jalee sanadichaa irratti gadi galagaleeti."" This translates to: ""The words inscribed on the Declaration of Independence said “Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776”. The inscription found on it was done in pencil."" 

Therefore, the Declaration was **inscribed** (written) on the document.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Singaappor maalin beekamti?,"The correct answer is **A: Magaala magariisa (Gardens City)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jalqaba bilisummaa biyyaa keessatti, muuxannoon Mooraa Biqiltootaa Singaapoor lafa bishaan gidduutti argamtu gara Magaalaa Biqiltuu tirooppikaalaatti jijjiiruuf fayyada."" This translates to ""In the early days of its independence, the vision of Singapore's founding fathers was to transform the island nation into a Garden City.""

Therefore, Singapore is known as the Garden City.
"
Vaandaa Miis Joakum maalidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Abaaboo** (Father).

The text states: ""Vaandaa Miis Johaakiim kan jedhamu, kan makaa abaaboo Orkiid ta’e..."" which translates to ""Vaandaa Miis Johaakiim, who was the father of the Orchid...""  Therefore, Vaandaa Miis Johaakiim was the father of the orchid.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, qulqullina (quality) piraamidiiwwan Giizaa keessaa Mootummaa Masirii Haaradhaan kan hin ajaa’ibsiifatamne maalidha?","The correct answer is **B: Itti fayyadama dhagaa (Use of stone)**.

Here's why:

The question asks why the pyramids of Giza weren't considered amazing by the Old Kingdom Egyptians, according to the text. The text states that the Egyptians were accustomed to seeing pyramids built by their ancestors for thousands of years. Therefore, it wasn't the *size* (C), *design* (D), or *construction* (A) that was underwhelming. 

The text specifically mentions that the Old Kingdom Egyptians had *already* built pyramids for millennia.  This implies that the *material used* (stone) was not particularly novel or impressive to them.  They were accustomed to building with stone.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bineensonni biqiloota sooratan rooba barbaacha eessaa dhufu?","The correct answer is **B: Gaarren kaabaa (Horn of Africa)**.

The passage states that the wildebeest migrate from the Horn of Africa (specifically the Mara River region) to the Serengeti and back. Therefore, the wildebeest are originating from the Horn of Africa.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, bineensonni biqiloota sooratan yeroo tokko tokko naannoo ji’a Eblaa naannoo kamii ka’u?","The correct answer is **C: Laga Maaraa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Rooba barbaacha laga Maaraa qaxxaamuruun gaarota kaabaarraa gara dirree kibbaatti geejjiba taasisu."" which translates to ""The wildebeest migration, driven by the Mara River, crosses from the northern plains to the southern plains.""
"
Opireeshin Siilaayin kan jedhamu weerara biyya kamiiti?,"The correct answer is **A: Jarman**.

The text states: ""Jarmaniin haleellaa sana maqaa koodii “Haleellaa Siilaayen” jedhu itti moggaafte."" This translates to ""Germany's campaign, its name was nicknamed 'Operation Falaise'."" Therefore, Operation Falaise (or Siilaayin in the Amharic text) was a German operation.
"
Jarman haleellaa Biriteen irratti raawwate maal jettee waamti?,"The correct answer is **B: Opiireeshin Siilaayin**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jarmaniin haleellaa sana maqaa koodii “Haleellaa Siilaayen” jedhu itti moggaafte."" This translates to ""The German offensive gave it a code name of 'Operation Seelowa'.""  ""Haleellaa Siilaayen"" is the Somali translation of ""Operation Seelowa"".

While Dankirk, Kiriigsmaarin, and Rooyaal Neevii are mentioned in the text, they aren't the answer to *what the German offensive gave it a code name of*. The code name was Operation Seelowa (Haleellaa Siilaayen).
"
Karoora Xaaliyaanin biyyoota Afrikaa qabachuuf baafatte keessatti kan hin eeramin maalidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Dooniwwan Masirii keessa jiran dhiisuu (Disposing of ships in the Mediterranean)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sanaaf, buufataalee fi dooniiwwan Biriitish biyya Masir irraa fagaachuu qabu."" This translates to: ""Therefore, they had to get rid of British ships from Egypt."" This implies that the ships were disposed of (likely sunk or otherwise removed) from the Mediterranean Sea.

The other options are not mentioned in the text as things the Italians did regarding their ships in Africa:

*   **B: Markaboota haaraa ijaaruu (Building new ships):** The text doesn't mention building new ships.
*   **C: Paadii ittiin loltuu ergan hundeessuu (Equipping ships with ammunition):**  The text only talks about the ships having weapons.
*   **D: Buufataalee Biritiish barbadeessuu (Destroying British ships):** The text indicates that the Italians had to *get rid of* British ships, not necessarily destroy them, although destruction could be part of that process.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is disposing of ships in the Mediterranean.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kaayyoon ijoon Xaaliyaanin waraana qindeessiteef maal ture?","The correct answer is **B: Waraana fi humna galaanaa cimaa ijaaruu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Galmawwan guguddoon Xaaliyaanii biyyoota Afriikaa ture. Biyyoota sanniin qabachuuf, waraanni Galaana Meediitiraaniyaanii ce’ee Afriikaa weeraruuf bakka loltuuwwan irraa bobbaafaman qabaachuutu isii barbaachisa ture.

Amma Jaappaaniif.""

This indicates a primary motivation for the naval power of the Allies was to secure territories (Africa), establish a strong presence (war and naval power), and control sea lanes (Mediterranean and Africa). While they did take control of British supplies in Egypt, and eventually established British presence, the core driving force was establishing a strong, dominant force.

The other options are not the primary reason:

*   **A: Biyyoota Afrikaa qabachuu:** While they *did* occupy Africa, this was a *means* to an end, not the fundamental goal.
*   **C: Dooniwwan Masirii dhiisuu:** This was a secondary action, not the main objective.
*   **D: Buufatee Biriitish hundeessuu:**  This was a consequence of their actions, but not the primary motivation for building naval power.



"
Weerartoota waliin hariiroo hiriyummaa kan tolfate eenyudha?,"The correct answer is **A: Warra Jarmanoota**.

The text states: ""...weerrarichis “Ooppireeshinii Diragonii” jedhama ture. Torban lama qofa keessatti Amerikaanonnii fi humnoonni Faransaayii Walabaa Faransaay kibbaa bilisaa baasanii gara Jermanitti naanna’aa turan.""  This translates to ""...the battle was called ""Operation Dragon."" Only two divisions of Americans and Free French forces launched an offensive into occupied France against the Germans."" Therefore, the forces they fought against were the Germans.
"
Oppireeshinii Diraagon keessatti humnoonni Waloo hirmaatan eenyu turan?,"The correct answer is **A: Ameerikaanotaa fi Faraansaayi Bilisaa (American and Free French)**.

The text states: ""Torban lama qofa keessatti Amerikaanonnii fi humnoonni Faransaayii Walabaa Faransaay kibbaa bilisa baasanii gara Jermanitti naanna’aa turan."" This translates to: ""Only two divisions were sent to fight alongside the Free French by Americans and Free French.""

Therefore, the Free French, alongside Americans, participated in Operation Dragoon.
"
Gabbisa teeknolojii kamtu dooniwwan galaana jala deemuu akka jalqabaniif sababa ta’e?,"The correct answer is **D: Raadaarii (Radar)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yeroo sanitti baay’ee suuta kan jedhaniifi fageenyi isaan itti dhukaasanis murtaawaa ture. Jalqaba lolaa irratti yeroo baayyee galaana irra deemaa turan, garuu akkuma raadaariin uumamaa fi bayyee sirrataa dhufeen dooniin galaana jala deemtu guttumman akka hin muldhanneef gaalaana jala deemuuf dirqaman.""

Translation: ""At that time, they were worried about the lack of fuel and their capabilities. Initially, they often operated on the surface, but as radar was created and became widespread, submarines were encouraged to operate underwater because they were no longer vulnerable to surface detection.""

Therefore, the development of radar allowed submarines to operate underwater more safely.
"
"Yeroo sadarkaa jalqabaa isaanii, dooniwwan galaana jala deeman maal irratti reenjii murtaa’a qabu turan?","The correct answer is **A: Naavigeeshinii (Navigation)**.

The passage states: ""Jalqaba lolaa irratti yeroo baayyee galaana irra deemaa turan, garuu akkuma raadaariin uumamaa fi bayyee sirrataa dhufeen dooniin galaana jala deemtu guttumman akka hin muldhanneef gaalaana jala deemuuf dirqaman.""  This translates to: ""In the early days, they often operated on the surface, but with the advent of radar and spotter planes, surface ships were vulnerable, so they sought to operate submerged.""

The vulnerability to radar and spotter planes directly relates to the challenges of **navigation** while submerged.  They needed to find their way without being detected. The other options are less directly addressed in the passage:

*   **Deemsa (Maneuvering):** While important, the passage focuses more on avoiding detection.
*   **Dhukaasuu (Durability):** The passage mentions their durability due to the abundance of underwater resources, but not as a primary concern in their early surface operations.
*   **Hojjachuu (Operating):** The passage discusses *how* they operated (on the surface or submerged) but not the general challenges of operating.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, eenyutu waliigaltee cabse? ","The correct answer is **D: Warra Sooviyeetii (The Soviets)**.

The passage states: ""yemmuu loltuuwwan 800,000 Reed Aarmii Tokkummaa Sooviyet...weeraranii adda waraanaa Beelaaruusiyaa fi Yuukireeyin uuman.""  This translates to ""when 800,000 of the Soviet Union's Red Army fought...they created the armed forces of Belarus and Ukraine."" This clearly indicates the Soviet Union was the entity that formed these armed forces through the conflict.  The passage also mentions Polish and Romanian forces being involved in the initial fighting, but the decisive action leading to the creation of the new armed forces was taken by the Soviets.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Red Armii dhaan kan hin raawwatamne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Uumamuu adda waraanaa Yukireen (Creating the Belarusian Armed Forces)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the following:

*   The Red Army fought and defeated the German forces in Poland.
*   As a result, the Belarusian and Ukrainian armed forces were formed.

Option A states that the creation of the Belarusian armed forces did not happen. The passage explicitly states that it *did* happen.

Let's break down the other options:

*   **B: Weerara naannolee bahaa (Fighting in the eastern regions):** The passage describes the Red Army fighting in the eastern regions of Poland, specifically the areas controlled by the Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet-backed government. This *did* happen.
*   **C: Naannoo riqicha sanaatti deebi’anii gurmaa’uu (Returning to that region and preparing):** The passage describes the German forces retreating and the Red Army advancing into Poland, thus returning to the region.  The passage mentions that the German forces were defeated and forced to withdraw.  This *did* happen.
*   **D: Walii galtee cabsuu (Establishing a truce):** The passage describes the Red Army defeating German forces and establishing a peace treaty, which *did* happen.

Therefore, the only option that contradicts the passage is A.
"
Injinara Olaanaa Humna Waranaa Kurnaffaa Xaaliyaanii maaltu isa mudate?,"The correct answer is **A: Fort Capuzzo tti qabame**.

The text states: ""Riphanii loluu dhiha Baardiyaatiin, warri Ingilizii Hoogganaa Injinerootaa Loltoota Xaaliyaanii Kurnaffaa, Jeneraal Laatuuchii qabatan. Gaafa Waxabajji 28, Maarshaal Italo Balbo, hoogganaan Jeneraala Liibiya akkasumas dhaaltun Mosolonii, kan du’an dhuukasa hiriyyummaan utuu **Tobruki keessa qubachuuf jedhanii.**""

This means the Italian forces, led by General La Touche, were captured after the battle of Fort Capuzzo. The plan was to eventually capture Tobruk, but the initial capture of Fort Capuzzo was the key event.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Itaaloo Balboo eessatti ajjeefame?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruuk**.

The text states: ""Maarshaal Italo Balbo, hoogganaan Jeneraala Liibiya akkasumas dhaaltun Mosolonii, kan du’an dhuukasa hiriyyummaan utuu **Tobruuk** keessa qubachuuf jedhanii."" This means Marshal Italo Balbo was defeated and retreated to Tobruk.

The text states: ""Giddugaleeessi meediteeshinii tibeetaan Yoogaa Waaqaati. Karaa ilaalcha waaqolee garaagaraa daandiiwwan anniisaa ni qulqullaahu, chaakiraawwan ni damaqsamu, akkasumas sammuu banamaan ni uumamu."" This translates to: ""The core of Tibetan meditation is Yoga of Deities. The path of vision of various deities is purified, are visualized as wheels, and are created as light.""

Option C directly reflects this description of visualizing deities as light.  The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo “giddu galeessa” Tibeetan Mediteeshiniitti chaakras akkamitti akka hojjatu ykn dammaqu godhama?","The correct answer is **B: Waaqolii fakkii sammuun ilaaluun (Visualizing deities as light)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Karaa ilaalcha waaqolee garaagaraa daandiiwwan anniisaa ni qulqullaahu, chaakiraawwan ni damaqsamu, akkasumas sammuu banamaan ni uumamu."" This translates to: ""The path of visualizing various deities is sanctified, chakras are illuminated, and light is created.""

This directly connects the Tibetan meditation's ""central"" aspect (the ""giddu galeessa"") with visualizing deities as light, which is a key function of chakras in this context. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Yeroo sagantaa faarsaa ykn weedduu waaqeffannaa lammaffaa eenyutu dhiyeesse?,"The correct answer is **B: Laakha Singh**.

The text states: ""Achii ,Lakkahaa Sinyiin bahaajan sirbuu keessaatti dursa fudhate."" which translates to ""Furthermore, Lakha Singh initiated the bhajan (hymn) for worship.""
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, yeroo kennaa nyaataa eenyutu faarsaa ykn weedduu waaqeffannaa dhiyeesse?","The correct answer is **A: Laakha Singh**.

The text states: ""Achii,Lakkahaa Sinyiin bahaajan sirbuu keessaatti dursa fudhate."" which translates to ""Also, Lakha Singh initiated the offering of the Chappan Bhog.""
"
Sagantaan lammataa fi kan dhumaa galgalaa maal ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Seezen Aksuu, Aleesaandiroo Safiinaa fi Haaris Aleeksiyo**.

The text states: ""Weellistuun Tarkii Seezen Askuu weellisaa Xaaliyaanii Alessaandiroo Saafiinaa fi weellisaa Giriik Haariis Aleksoo wajjiin taphatte."" which translates to ""In collaboration with Turkish Season Aksu, Italian Alessandro Safina, and Greek Haris Alexiou."" These three artists collaborated on the performance.

While the other options are mentioned in the text, they aren't the answer to the question about the final two performances.
"
Aleesaandiroo Safiinaa biyyi isaa eessa?,"The correct answer is **B: Nama Giriikii**.

The text states ""weellisaa Giriik Haariis Aleksoo wajjiin taphatte,"" which translates to ""collaborated with Greek artist Haris Alexiou.""  Since Alexandria Safinaa collaborated with a Greek artist, she is Greek.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, himoota armaan gadii keessaa kamtu dhugaadha?","The correct answer is **D: Nama jalqabaa konkolaaticharraa buusuf yoo xiqqaate daqiiqaa 60 fudhate (If someone tries to get on the escalator at the beginning, it takes 60 seconds.)**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""namuma isa jalqabaa illee konkolaaticharraa buusuuf yoo xiqqaate sa’atii tokko fudhate"" which translates to ""If someone tries to get on the escalator at the beginning, it takes an hour (60 minutes)."" The options provide the time in minutes, so we need to convert the hour to minutes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Saantaa Kilaaraa keessa abidatu ture (Santa Clara was in a heatwave):** While the passage mentions a heatwave, it doesn't say it *was* in a heatwave. It says the temperature reached 90°F.
* **B: Namoonni roolar koostarii irratti danqamanii turan (People were standing on the escalator):** The passage doesn't mention people standing on the escalator. It talks about trying to get *on* it.
* **C: Imaltootaf bishaan kennamee ture (The heat was given to the manufacturer):** This is illogical and not supported by the passage. The heat affected Santa Clara, not the manufacturer.



"
"Akkataa kutichaatti, sadarkaa hoo’aa namatti hin tolle ilaalchisee eenyutu yaada kenne?","The correct answer is **B: Kapteenii abiddaa (Captain of the Guard)**.

The passage states: ""Itti gaafatamaan balaa abiddaa Iskoot Kaawunsi...yeroo hanga feeteef rooler koostar irra turuun mijataa hinta’u, gadi qabeema yoon dubbadhe illee, namuma isa jalqabaa illee konkolaaticharraa buusuuf yoo xiqqaate sa’atii tokko fudhate.""  This quote is attributed to Captain Scott Kawunsi, the disaster response chief.  Therefore, the Captain of the Guard (which is what ""Itti gaafatamaan balaa abiddaa"" translates to) was the one who observed the situation and made the assessment about the delay.



"
Sababa sunaamutiin ibsaan eessatti badee ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Toongaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Humni ibsaa yeroof badee ture, kun immoo itti gaafatamtootni Toongaa akeekachiisa Suunamii PTWC dhaan darbu akka hin fudhanne taasise.""  This translates to ""The warning system failed on time, which led the people of Tonga to not heed the tsunami warning from PTWC.""

Therefore, the failure of the warning system occurred in Tonga. While other locations are mentioned (Pago Pago, Nuku'alofa, Hawaii), the passage directly attributes the failure of the *warning system* to Tonga.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Toongan ibsaan baduudhan akkamitti miidhamte?","The correct answer is **C: Sadarkaan galaanaa (Sea level) dubbisuun miidhameera**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Manneen barnoota kudha afur kan Hawaayii tti ykn naannoo sanatti argaman gaafaa Roobi cufa dha yooma akeekachisnee kennameera ta’eeyyu."" This translates to: ""Four schools in Hawaii or the region found that the sea level had risen.""  This directly indicates that the tsunami was measured by observing changes in sea level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: miidhamni muraasni qaqqabuun gabaafamee ture** - This translates to ""The measurement was based on written records"". The text doesn't mention written records being used.
*   **B: Waa’ee akeekkachiisni ka’uu aangawoonni oduu isaa hin dhageenye** - This translates to ""The warnings of the leading scientists were not heeded"". While this is a factual statement, it doesn't describe *how* the tsunami was measured.
*   **D: Angawoonni akeekkachiisa barbaachisaa argachuu hin dandeenye** - This translates to ""The necessary warning signals could not be obtained"". Again, this describes a problem with the warning system, not how the tsunami was measured.

* The text explicitly states: ""Obbo Reeyid konkolaataa Niiwu Ziilaandii A1GP, Bilaak Biyuutii sa’a tokkotti saffisaa kiiloo meetira 160 ol al torba riqicha irra oofuu danda’eera."" This translates to ""Mr. Reyid, in his New Zealand A1GP racer, Black Beauty, was able to reach a speed of over 160 kilometers per hour on the straight.""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Yeeroo inni 160km/h konkolaachisaa ture** - While he reached 160km/h, the text says he went *over* that speed.
* **B: Yeroo torbaffaa isaatti riqicha irratti** -  This is too general. The text doesn't specify *when* he was on the straight.
* **D: Yeroo jalqabaa isaatti riqicha irratti** - This is incorrect as it refers to the beginning of his race.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, saffisa Joonii Reeyid ittiin konkolaachisaa ture galmeessun poolisii Niwu Ziilandif maalif rakkisaa ta’e?","The correct answer is **A: Inni 160km/h gadiin konkolaachisaa ture (He was driving at 160km/h).**

The text explicitly states that police had issues with the speed of Joonii Raayid's driving, specifically mentioning he was clocked driving at 160km/h. The other options are not mentioned in the provided text.
"
Lafa qaramee ol ka’e (butte) dhaan wal-qabatee kirkirri lafaa bu’uurri isaa eessa ture?,"The correct answer is **B: Gara kibbaatti maayilii 40**.

The text states: ""Kirkirri lafichaa kan inni raawwate Kaaba-Kaaba-Bahaa Diiloon irraa naannoo kiiloomeetira 20 (maayilii 15) irrattii, fi Kibba Buttee irraa ammoo naannoo kiiloo meetira 65 (maayilii 40) irratti.""  This means the earthquake's epicenter was 40 miles (maayilii 40) south of Butte.
"
Yeroo hokkorri Abu Gahraibittu ka’e maaltu ta’e?,"The correct answer is **B: Sochii daangeffamuu (Torture)**.

Here's why:

The first sentence states that Manni hidhaa Abuu Gaharaayibii Iraaq yeroo warraqsaa gabjedheera (Manni hidhaa Abuu Ghraib was established in Iraq during the war). The following sentence says that after the US military facilitated the torture of prisoners, Manni hidhichaa ergaa humni waraanaa US fudhatee hidhaamtootni mirgii isaani sarbamuun argameen booda baayee jibbisasaa ta’e (Manni hidhaa became very angry after seeing that the prisoners were tortured by US military forces, which were facilitated by the US military).

The question asks what happened when the Abu Ghraib prison scandal broke. The scandal was primarily about the torture of prisoners. Therefore, the most accurate answer is torture.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Miidhaa nama mana hidhaa jururra gahu (People arriving at the prison)** - This is a neutral statement, not directly related to the core of the Abu Ghraib scandal.
*   **C: Waraanni US to’achuu itti fufe (The war with the US intensified)** - While the war was the context, the scandal itself was about the prison abuses.
*   **D: Mana hidhaatti abiddi qabsiifame (The prison was sealed off)** - While there were investigations and consequences, the initial breaking of the scandal revolved around the torture itself.



"
Manni hidhaa Iraaq maalif beekame? ,"The correct answer is **A: Abiddi itti qabsiifame (He was deeply affected)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Manni hidhaa (Manni hidha) was deeply angered after US forces, acting on US military support, raided his home.  ""Abiddi itti qabsiifame"" translates to ""He was deeply affected"" or ""He was deeply angered,"" which best captures the feeling expressed in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Waraanni US ni to’ate (The US war was destroyed)** - The passage doesn't say the war was destroyed.
*   **C: Hokkora heddutu ture (There was a large amount of looting)** - The passage mentions a home raid, not general looting.
*   **D: Miidhaa nama mana hidhaa jururra gahu bira gahamuu (People were going to the home of the person who was arrested)** - This option doesn't align with the provided context. The passage is about the reaction to a raid on his home, not people going to his house.



"
Isteediyeemii Yaadannoo Waraana Maa’uwi tti( Maui's War Memorial Stadium) sagantaalee akkamitu gaggeeffama ture?,"The text states the Baandichi agarsiisa isaa Istaadoomii Yaadannoo Waraana Maawuuyiittii, isa namoonni 9,000 irratti argamu jedhamanii yaadaman, haqee deeggartoota isaa dhiifama gaafate. This implies the stadium hosts various events. The options provided are:

*   **A: Agarsiisa maajikii (Magic Shows)**
*   **B: Tapaha kubbaa miilaa (Football Matches)**
*   **C: Konsartii (Concerts)**
*   **D: Sagantaa galii sassaabuu (Information Sessions)**

While the text doesn't specify *which* events happen there, the fact that the stadium holds 9,000 people suggests it's used for larger gatherings. All the options are plausible. However, the question asks about events that are *typically* held in a stadium of that size.

Without more context, it's difficult to definitively say which event is the *most* common. However, given the size and general purpose of a stadium, **C: Konsartii (Concerts)** and **B: Tapaha kubbaa miilaa (Football Matches)** are the most likely and common events. The text doesn't indicate a preference for either.

Since the prompt requests a choice, and both concerts and football matches are very plausible, let's consider the nuance. ""Agarsiisa maajikii"" and ""Sagantaa galii sassaabuu"" are less likely to fill a stadium of 9,000 people.

Given that the question asks about activities that typically fill a stadium of that size, and no information is given to indicate one event is more popular than another, let's assume the most common are football matches or concerts.

Given the options, I'll choose the one that is the most common stadium event:

**B: Tapaha kubbaa miilaa (Football Matches)**

It's a common and significant event in many stadiums worldwide.

However, it is also plausible to argue that concerts are common. Therefore, both B and C are correct. Since I have to choose only one, I will choose B.
"
Sagantichi haqamuu ilaalchisee eenyutu ibsa kenne?,"The correct answer is **B: Manajimentii kampaanichaa (Campaign Management)**.

The passage states that HK Management Inc., the campaign management company, did not provide a reason for the 20-hour delay, only citing logistical issues. Therefore, the management of the campaign is the entity being referenced.
"
Hanna gaggeeffame ilaalchisee jiraattonni Bishkeek heddu eentutu itti gaafatama jedhanii yaadu?,"The correct answer is **C: Mormitoota**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jiraattonni Bishkeeki heeddun al-seerummaa jiruuf mormitoota kibbaa dhufan komatu."" This translates to: ""The people of Bishkek, due to the increase in the 'al-seerummaa' (likely referring to the crime/lawlessness), blamed the southern migrants.""

Therefore, the people of Bishkek are blaming the migrants, who are described as ""mormitoota"" (southern people/migrants).
"
Hannaaf eenyutu mormitoota kibbarraa dhufan komate?,"The correct answer is **A: Jiraattota Bishkeek (Residents of Bishkek)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jiraattonni Bishkeeki heeddun al-seerummaa jiruuf mormitoota kibbaa dhufan komatu."" which translates to ""The residents of Bishkek, due to the increasing ""al-seerummaa"" (a term implying a loss of security/order), have become fearful of the southern migrants.""

Therefore, it's the residents of Bishkek who are fearful of the southern migrants.
"
Kampaanin Ring gurgurtaansaa kan dabaale yoom?,"The correct answer is **A: Erga shaark Taank mul’atee (Since Shark Tank)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Siminoff akka jedhutti erga inni 2013 kutaa fiilmii Taankii Shaark iddoo itti beeksisni agarsiisichaa deggersa jalqabsiisuu kuffise’en booda gurgurtaan baayyee dabale jedhe."" (Siminoff said that since he appeared on the Shark Tank show in 2013, his growth has accelerated greatly.)

While the other options are milestones in Ring's history, the text clearly indicates that the growth spurt began *after* appearing on Shark Tank.
"
Jeemii Siminof kampaanii Ring kan eegale yoomi?,"The correct answer is **D: QCV milkaa’inaan erga mul’ateen booda** (After appearing on QVC).

The text states: ""Xumura 2017 keessatti, Siminoof chaanalii televiziyoonaa bittaa QVL irratti mul’ate."" which translates to ""In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC television channel.""  The passage also implies that this appearance significantly boosted Ring's popularity and sales. Options B and C are incorrect because the text states the problems were identified *before* Shark Tank and the funding came *before* QVC.
"
Tokkoon tokkoo Reading Rainbow ijoolledhaaf waan ta’uu qabu maal dhiyeesse?,"The correct answer is **A: Agarsiisa televizhiinii (Television show)**.

The text explicitly states that ""Tokkoon tokkoon kutaalee agarsiisaa qabiiyyee kitaaba murtaa’ee irratti hundaa’a akkasumas sana booda qabiiyyee sana seenaa baay’ee keessatti qoratu."" This translates to ""Part of its programming focuses on books, and later it extensively writes about stories."" The text further describes it as a television show that encourages children to read. Options B, C, and D are related to reading but are not the primary focus of Reading Rainbow as described in the text.
"
Sagantaalee walitti fufiinsaa Reading Rainbow akka haqamu maaltu sababa ta’e laata?,"The correct answer is **B: Hanqina badhaasa Emmy**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tokkoon tokkoon kutaalee agarsiisaa qabiiyyee kitaaba murtaa’ee irratti hundaa’a akkasumas sana booda qabiiyyee sana seenaa baay’ee keessatti qoratu."" This refers to the show's focus on books and reading.

The text further explains that John Grant, from WNED Buffalo, stated ""Rediing Renboon sababaa maaliif akka dubbisu qabu barsiisa,… dubbisuu jallachu — [agarsiisichi] ijoollee kakaase akka macaafa fudhanii fi dubbisaniif."" This indicates the show was praised for encouraging children to read and learn.

The question asks *why* Reading Rainbow was canceled.  The text doesn't directly state the reason for cancellation. However, the phrase ""Fandii gahaa dhabuu"" (Financial failure) is listed as an option. While financial failure is a common reason for show cancellations, the text doesn't mention it. 

The text focuses on the show’s educational value and praise. Therefore, the most logical inference, though not explicitly stated *as the reason for cancellation*, is that the show’s decline likely stemmed from a lack of financial support, which in turn could have been linked to a lack of Emmy awards (a key indicator of success and, therefore, funding). Therefore, option B, **Hanqina badhaasa Emmy** (Lack of Emmy awards), is the best answer, even though it's an implied reason rather than a directly stated one.



"
Waa’ee mukichaa ilaalchisee kanneen armaan agdii keessaa Amistardamii fi muuziyeemiidhaaf angawwoonni kan irratti komii hin kaasne kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Faangasiidhan faalameera (They claimed it was a gas leak)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...balaa fayyaa hawaasaa isaan gara kufaatiitti dhihaataa akka jiru isaan balaaleffatan. Kan karoorfamee ture gaafa kibxataa adda kutuu dha, garuu nuti kan olchiinee ergee sababa gaggeessummaan mana murtiif yeroo muddamatii kennameefi.""  This translates to ""...they caused the deaths of the people as if they had fallen unconscious due to a health disaster. What was reported was a gas leak, but we later discovered, by investigating, that they gave a false reason to the court.""

Therefore, the authorities claimed the disaster was a gas leak.
"
"Akkaataa qorataa olaanaa RSPCA tti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qorannoon kamiif kan sadarkaa isaa eeggate ta’uu qaba?","The correct answer is **A: Kaamerawwan CCTV (CCTV cameras)**.

The text explicitly states that RSPCA is requesting CCTV cameras to be installed in animal shelters to monitor how animals are treated. The quote from Inspector David O’Shanesy focuses on the benefit of CCTV in providing evidence and ensuring animal welfare.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, hojjattoota mana foonii Awustiraaliyaatif fayyummaa bineensotaa kan cimsuuf maaltu gargaara?","The correct answer is **B: RSPCA wajjin wal gahii murteessaa taasisuu**.

Here's why:

The text states that RSPCA is requesting that CCTV cameras be installed in Australian animal shelters to monitor the welfare of animals. It also mentions that RSPCA inspectors conduct inspections. This implies that collaborating with RSPCA and having a system in place for them to inspect (which CCTV facilitates) is the key to improving animal welfare in these shelters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kaameran CCTV dhaabbachuu (Turning off CCTV):** This is the opposite of what the text describes. The purpose is to *install* CCTV.
*   **C: Dhaabbataan mana foonii to’achuu (Closing down the shelter):** This is an extreme measure and not mentioned as a solution in the text.
*   **D: To’annoo ABC irraa (From the ABC report):** The ABC report is just *reporting* on the situation, not a solution itself. The solution is the collaboration with RSPCA and the CCTV monitoring.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, hojiin namicha hidhame sanaa maalidha?","The correct answer is **A: Barataa (Student)**.

The text explicitly states: ""birraa barataan tokko dhukaasa mana barnootaa irratti bitootessa 21 ta’e waliin quunnamitii qaba jedhamuun hidhameera."" This translates to ""a student, who was 21 years old, was arrested along with a protest.""
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, namni biraa hidhamuu oduun tamsa’aa yeroo ture, awwaalcha namoota meeqatu gaggeeffamaa ture?","The correct answer is **A: Tokko (One)**.

The text states: ""birraa barataan tokko dhukaasa mana barnootaa irratti bitootessa 21 ta’e waliin quunnamitii qaba jedhamuun hidhameera."" This translates to: ""one student was arrested with 21 others for participating in a protest at the school.""
"
"Mormiif deebii kennuuf, biyya kamtu walii galtee ACTA mallatteesse hojiirra hin oolchine?","The correct answer is **C: Iskootland**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mormiin Paarisitti, Soofiyaa Bulgaariyaatti, Vilniyas Liituuniyaatti, Vaaleettaa Maltaatti, Taaliin Istooniyaatti, **Eedinbargii fi Gilaasgoow Iskootlaanditti illee gaggeeffameera.**""  This translates to: ""Protests took place in Paris, Sofia Bulgaria, Vilnius Lithuania, Valletta Malta, Tallinn Estonia, **Edinburgh and Glasgow Scotland not.**""

This directly indicates that protests did *not* occur in Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland.  Therefore, the question is asking which country *didn't* implement ACTA. The text indicates that Scotland did not implement ACTA.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, biyyoota armaan gadii keesaa adeemsa ACTA tti makamuurratti adda ta’uu kan murteessan kami?","The correct answer is **D: Laatviyaa**.

The text states: ""Laativia fi Silovaakiyaa lamaan isaanii adeemsa walitti dhufuu ACTA tursiisaniiru."" This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia have ratified the ACTA agreement.""  While the other options are mentioned as locations where protests occurred, Latvia is the only country explicitly stated to have ratified the agreement, indicating they are actively moving *towards* implementing ACTA, which could be interpreted as a reason for opposition in other countries.
"
Sababa balaa iPod’n baay’ee hoo’un uumameen namoota meeqatu muudhame?,"The correct answer is **B: 27**.

The text states: ""Balaan 27 akka muddate beekameera."" which translates to ""It was known that the damage amounted to 27."" This refers to the number of iPods that were damaged due to the issue.
"
Balaab baay’ee hoo’un uumame sun baay’ee cimaa miti eenyutu jedhe?,"The correct answer is **A: METI**.

The passage states: ""Miniistirii Diinagdee, Daldalaa fi Induustirii Jaappaan (METI) akka jedhaniitti meeshaa sanaan wal qabatee balaan 27 akka muddate beekameera."" This directly translates to ""The Minister of Religion, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that 27 people died in the disaster.""

Therefore, METI is the entity mentioned as providing information about the death toll.
"
"Yeroo haasaa taasisu, Istiiv Joobs Appiliin maal irra deebin kalaquuf jira jedhee ture?","The correct answer is **A: Seenaa (Story)**.

The passage states, ""Har’a Appiliin bilbila haarawa uumuuf adeema, nutis har’a seenaa hojjechuuf adeemaa jirra” which translates to ""Apple strives to create powerful phones, but we strive to tell stories.""
"
Kaayyon haasaa sa’aatii lamaa Istiiv Joobs maalidha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bilbila haaraa beeksisuu (Introducing a new phone)**.

The text states that Steve Jobs announced the iPhone, which is a phone. He said, ""Apple is here to make phones, not to make history."" He then went on to say, ""We are here to make history."" This implies he was introducing a new phone (the iPhone).  The timing of his speech (2 hours) is irrelevant to the question of *what* he was announcing.
"
Tiyaatira Arjentiinaa irratti Kiristiinaa Fernaandeez de Kirchnar maal beeksifte?,"The correct answer is **A: Pirezidaantummaaf kaadhimamuu ishee** (Her candidacy for presidency).

The text states: ""Aadde Kirchiiner Tiyatirii Arjentinaatti pirezdaantii ta’uuf akka dorgoman yaada isaanii beeksisanii jiru..."" which translates to ""Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president of Argentina...""

Therefore, option A is the accurate reflection of what she announced.
"
Kiristiinaa Fernaandeez de Kirchnar dorgomuuf akka fedha qabdu kan beeksifte eessatti?,"The correct answer is **A: La Pilaataa irraa maayilii 31 kan fagaatu tiyaatiratti**

The text states: ""Aadde Kirchiiner Tiyatirii Arjentinaatti pirezdaantii ta’uuf akka dorgoman yaada isaanii beeksisanii jiru, bakkee walfakaatuttiis duula bakka bu’aa mana maree ishee miseensa Bonoo saayrasii taatee kan 2005 jalqabde.""

This translates to: ""Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Teatro Argentino, a place where she also had her official residence, the Casa Rosada, since 2005.""

The key phrase is ""Tiyatirii Arjentinaatti pirezdaantii ta’uuf akka dorgoman yaada isaanii beeksisanii jiru"" which means she announced her intention to run for president at the Teatro Argentino. The text also says the Teatro Argentino is 50 kilometers (31 miles) from La Plata.

Therefore, the answer is that she announced her intention at the Teatro Argentino, which is located 31 miles from La Plata.
"
Big Birothers ilaalchisee argannoowwan ACMA maal fa’i?,"The correct answer is **A: Seerri to’annoo odeeffannoo (censorship law) cabee hin turre**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Biig Biraazariin seera gulaallii qabiyyee toora inatrneetiirraa cabsee hinturre."" (Big Brothers did not remove the content due to internet content regulation law.)

This directly indicates that the censorship law wasn't the reason for ACMA's complaint. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided.
"
Miidiyaan tokko qabiyyee intarneetiti jedhamuuf ulaagaa kam jalatti ramadama?,"The correct answer is **B: Qaaman sarvarii irra jiraachuu qaba** (It must reside on a server).

Here's why:

The text states that while the ACMA (an Ethiopian regulatory body) is trying to address the issue of illegal online content,  the Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority has implemented regulations requiring online content to reside on a server.  This is to allow for content to be taken down if it violates the law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Intarneetii irratti darbuu qaba (It must be online):**  Being online is a prerequisite, but not the definitive requirement.  The content needs to be *hosted* somewhere.
* **C: Marsariitii irra kaa’amuu hin danda’u (Cannot be posted on a mirror site):**  The text implies the opposite. The whole point of the regulations is to prevent content from being easily reposted on mirror sites.
* **D: ACMA dhaan mirkanaa’uu qaba (ACMA must be satisfied):** While ACMA is involved, the core requirement is related to server hosting, not just their approval.



"
Gaggeessan Paartii Libbaraalii Awustiraaliyaa eenyu?,"The correct answer is **A: Piitar Kosteello**.

The text explicitly states: ""Piiter Kaasteeloon...aanee muummicha ta’a jedhamee tilmaami olaanaan kennameef..."" This means Peter Costello, a member of the Liberal Party of Australia, made the statement.
"
Awustiraaliyaan maalif industirii anniisaa nikularaa hanga yoonaa hin qabaatin?,"The passage doesn't directly state *why* Australia doesn't have a nuclear industry. However, it strongly implies the reason is due to **A: Deeggarsa uummataa waan dhabeef (lack of public support)**. 

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on Peter Costello's argument *against* a nuclear industry.** He's trying to persuade people that Australia *should* pursue nuclear power.
* **The mention of ""tilmaami olaanaan kennameef"" (giving a huge presentation) and ""jabaassee falma"" (actively campaigning)** suggests a significant effort is being made to *change* public opinion.  If public support already existed, such efforts wouldn't be necessary.
* **The reference to ""qajeelfamni mormii humna niwukilaaraaf hin jiru"" (lack of a clear regulatory framework for nuclear power)** points to a lack of political will, which is often a reflection of a lack of public demand.

The other options are less likely:

* **B: Baay’ee falmisiisadha (It's very complicated):** While nuclear power is complex, this doesn't explain why Australia *doesn't* have an industry.
* **C: Baay’ee balaafamaadha (It's very dangerous):** This is a common concern about nuclear power, but the passage doesn't highlight danger as a primary reason for Australia's lack of an industry.
* **D: Baay’ee qaalidha (It's very expensive):**  Cost is a factor, but the passage focuses more on the political/public support aspect.



Therefore, **A: Deeggarsa uummataa waan dhabeef (lack of public support)** is the best answer based on the information provided.
"
Deeggarsa nama qajeelchutiin nama cabbii sigigaatu kamtu dorgome?,"The correct answer is **A: Anna Jochemsan**.

"
Dorgommii dubartootaa Super-G irratti biyya kamtu kurnaffaan xumure?,"The correct answer is **A: Finland**.

The text states: ""Finlanditi Katja Saarineen waliin wanuma wal fakkata irratti kudhanaffaa ta’ee xumurun."" which translates to ""In Super-G, Katja Saarineen from Finland finished fourth.""
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee Bileek hima kamtu sirrii miti?","The correct answer is **D: Qaruuratti natti darbatame jedhee himata** (Claiming to have been beaten with a club).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abban murtichi Bileekiin akkas jedhe “dhorkuun kan hin danda’amne” gara mana hidhaati ergamuuf ture."" This translates to: ""The injury claim, Bileeki's father said, was sent to the police stating 'I couldn't stand.'""  This indicates Bileeki claimed he was beaten with a club (implied by ""dhorkuun"" which refers to a club).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakkichumatti to’annoo jala oole** (Claiming to have been beaten with a stick/rod): While similar to a club, the passage specifically mentions ""dhorkuun,"" which is more commonly understood as a club in this context.
* **B: Haleellaa gaggeessuusaa amane** (Claiming to have been beaten during a prayer): The passage doesn't mention any prayer or religious practice related to the alleged beating.
* **C: Yeroo haleellaa raawwatu poolii fayyadame** (Claiming the police used a baton during prayer): The passage doesn't mention the police using a baton during prayer.

Therefore, only option D directly reflects Bileeki's father's claim as stated in the passage.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kan Bileek irratti hin raawwanne kami?","The correct answer is **D: Mana hidhaatti ergamuunsaa akka hin oolle itti himame (It was not mentioned that he was sent to prison).**

Here's why:

* The text states that the Abba Murtichi (the priest/spiritual advisor) said Bileekiin was ""dhorkuun kan hin danda’amne"" (unable to confess). This implies Bileekiin was sent to prison *because* he couldn't confess.  The question asks what wasn't mentioned about Bileekiin.
* The text *does* mention that Bileekiin was sent to prison (""mana hidhaatti ergamuuf ture"").
* The other options are not directly supported by the text:
    * **A: Haqa jallisuusaatif yakkamaa ta’uun itti murtaa’e (He was punished for admitting the truth):** While the context suggests Bileekiin might be resisting confession, the text doesn't explicitly state he was punished *for* admitting the truth. It's more about his inability to confess.
    * **B: To’annoo jala oole (He was subjected to physical torture):** The text mentions Bileekiin used a condom to protect himself from ""tarmuusa namoota soddoma ta’aniin"" (the touch of sodomites), but not physical torture.
    * **C: Poolidhaan haleellan irratti raawwate (He was subjected to a police interrogation):** The text doesn't mention any police interrogation.



Therefore, the only thing *not* mentioned about Bileekiin is that he was sent to prison.



"
Fandiin hoo’ina addunyaa  Dhaabbanni Gamtoomanii wantota akkamiitif itti fayyadamuun hin danda’amu?,"The correct answer is **C: Manneen lolaan galuu hin dandeenye (Cannot enter conflict zones)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the UN peacekeeping forces are tasked with helping to **demonstrate the ability of international organizations to resolve conflicts**.  The passage highlights their ability to provide humanitarian aid, protect civilians, and monitor ceasefires. However, the key implication is that they are often **unable to physically enter conflict zones** due to the dangerous and unstable conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Callaa heddummeessuu (Increase calls):**  The text doesn't mention anything about the UN being unable to increase calls.
* **B: Biyyoonni guddataa jiran teeknolojii akka argatan gochuu (Allow major countries to access technology):** The text says that technology is being used to *help* the UN peacekeeping forces, not the other way around.
* **D: Miidhaa hoo’ina addunyaa maksuu (Deliver humanitarian aid):** The text explicitly states that UN peacekeeping forces *can* deliver humanitarian aid.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, UN maal oolchuu hawwa?","The correct answer is **A: Qarshii, karaa teeknolojii qooduutiin** (Money, through the advancement of technology).

Here's why:

The text states that the UN is working with global leaders to accelerate the development of ""faalama-xiqqoo"" (likely referring to a specific type of technology) to help countries affected by disasters.  It also mentions that this technology can be used for early warning, predicting droughts, and mitigating heat waves.  Therefore, the key is leveraging **money ( Qarshii )** to fuel the **advancement of technology ( karaa teeknolojii qooduutiin )**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Callaa (Goods/Merchandise):** While goods might be part of disaster relief, the core focus of the text is on technology and development.
* **C: Bosona roobaa hafan (Experienced/Skilled People):**  While skilled people are important, the text focuses on the *tools* (technology) to help.
* **D: Namoota bishaan qulqullina hin qabneen miidhaman (People affected by disasters):**  The text *mentions* these people, but it doesn't say that the UN's goal is simply to help them.  The goal is to *accelerate technological development* to *better assist* them.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waan ammayyuu irratti walii galamuu qabu kan Albart Muchaagaa hin eerin kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Guyyaa daldalli jalqabu (The date the collection begins)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Hanga ammaatti seerota maddaa fi taarifa hir’isuu irratti walii hingalle, garuu caasaan nuti qabnu Adoolessa 1, 2020 tti daldala eegaluu nu dandeessisa.""  This translates to: ""Up to now, we have not yet reached an agreement on exit laws and tariff reductions, but we have a commitment to be able to collect on January 1, 2020.""

The question asks what Albert Muchanga *didn't* mention. He didn't specifically say they had agreed on the rules, tariff reductions, or any other specific details, but he *did* state the date the collection would begin. Therefore, the date the collection begins is what he *didn't* elaborate on significantly.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, daldalli maalif Adoolessa eegaluu danda’a?","The correct answer is **B: Fireemwoorkii tumaawwanii fi wantonni fooyya’uu qaban lafa jiru**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hanga ammaatti seerota maddaa fi taarifa hir’isuu irratti walii hingalle, garuu caasaan nuti qabnu Adoolessa 1, 2020 tti daldala eegaluu nu dandeessisa."" This translates to: ""Up to now, we have not reached an agreement on reducing export laws and tariffs, but we have the power to collect duties from January 1, 2020.""

The question asks what the duties can enable Nigeria to do within the AfCFTA.  Since they can collect duties, it implies they can start benefiting from the framework and increased trade opportunities that the AfCFTA provides.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komishinarii daldalaa fi idustirii AUtiin tole jedhameera** (The Commissioner of Finance and Industry of the AU has said it) - While the Commissioner is quoted, this doesn't explain *what* the duties enable Nigeria to do.
* **C: Tumaawwan jalqabaa fi taarifa fooyya’u irratti walii galameera** (They are negotiating initial frameworks and increasing tariffs) - The text explicitly says they haven't reached agreements on reducing export laws and tariffs.
* **D: Tumaawwan jalqabaa fi taarifa fooyya’u irratti walii galameera** (They are negotiating initial frameworks and increasing tariffs) - This is a repeat of option C and is incorrect based on the text.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical inference based on the provided text.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Atilaantaa Journal-Constitution angawoota barnootaa maalif himate?","The correct answer is **C: Rakkoolee keessoo mudatan irratti tarkaanfii fudhachuu dhabuu** (Failing to take action on the problems identified).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Heerri-Barrulee Atilaantaa gabaasa rakkoolee deebii qormaataa waliin walqabatan maxxanse. Akka argannoon mul’iisutti tuqaan yaalii dabaleera ariitti baayee safiisaa ta’een, akkasumas shakkama mana barumsaa keessa akka argaamen garuu argannoo irratti hin fayyadamnee.""

This translates to: ""The Atlanta Board of Education released a report outlining problems with test scores. While the findings were apparent, they did not make use of the findings regarding what was happening inside the schools.""

This indicates that the Board of Education *failed to take action* on the problems revealed in the test score report.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gabaasa Journal-Constitution waliin dhahuu ykn jijjiiruu** (Partnering or collaborating with the Journal-Constitution) - The passage doesn't mention partnering with the Journal-Constitution.
* **B: Barnoota magaalaa kalaquu dadhabuu** (Failing to recruit local teachers) -  The passage focuses on test scores and problems within schools, not teacher recruitment.
* **D: Qabxuu qormaataa gadaanaa argachuu ykn gabaasuu** (Obtaining or reviewing transfer test results) - The passage doesn't mention transfer tests.



"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, gabaasa Atilaantaa Journal-Constitution keessatti kan hin eeramne maal ture?","The correct answer is **A: Qabxii qormaataa bifa hin baramneen fooyyessuu (Increasing test scores on unmeasured measures)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation revealed the school system was focusing on ""unmeasured measures"" to boost test scores.  The text highlights that while test scores initially appeared to improve, further investigation showed these gains were not sustainable and were achieved through methods not directly tied to actual student learning. The article also points out that a large number of test papers were destroyed, suggesting a cover-up.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Waraqaalen qormaataa waliin dhahamuu (Co-authoring test papers):** While the passage mentions test paper irregularities and destruction, it *doesn't* specifically state that test papers were co-authored.
*   **C: Mo’ataa 2013’s National Superintendent Barichaa (2013 National Superintendent’s memo):** The passage references memos from the Atlanta Board of Education, but not specifically a memo from the National Superintendent.
*   **D: Barnoota magaalaa kalaquuf yaadota furmaataa (Local educators’ solutions):** The passage discusses educators' ideas and experiences, but it doesn't say the investigation *didn't* consider their solutions.  It focused on the manipulation of test scores.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, haleellaa boombii hordofee odeeffannoo maaltu beekama?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkoofsa namoota miidhamanii isa dhumaa (The number of people injured)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""gabaasni tokko tokkoo baay’inna nama du’ee saddeetiin ga’u, gabaasni seeraa akka mirkaneessetti immoo hanga 30tu midhame, garuu amallee lakkoofsi inni dhumaa hin beekamne."" This translates to: ""the number of people killed reached eight, and the number of injured reached up to 30, but the exact number of missing is unknown.""

Option A directly reflects the information given about the number of injured people. While the text mentions fatalities and missing people, it doesn't provide a specific number for the dead or missing.
"
Erga bara 2017 Manchestar Siitii seenee Jiisas taphoota meeqa tapahate?,"The correct answer is **A: 24**.

The text states: ""Ergasii, Biraaziltichi kilabii isaaf dorgommii hunda kessatti tapha 53 taphatee goolii 24 galche."" This translates to: ""Since then, Brazil has scored 53 goals and 24 goals in all the matches for the club.""  The question asks how many goals Jesus scored for Manchester City *since 2017*. The text explicitly says he scored 24 goals.
"
Jiisas itti dabalamuudha £27 kan fudhate kilaba kamirraayi?,"The correct answer is **A: Paalmeyiras**.

The text states that Jesus was transferred from Manchester City to Palmeiras for £27 million.
"
Waa’ee keessummoota hosteelichaa himni dhugaa hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Keessummoonni jala bultii hajiitif achi turan** (The pilgrims were there on their Hajj journey).

Here's why:

* The text states the people were ""jalbultii imala hajjiitti magaalaa qulqullittii daawachuuf dhufan"" which translates to ""came to visit the holy city on their Hajj journey.""  This directly implies they were part of the Hajj pilgrimage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Keessummoonni imala ykn pilgirimeejidhaaf Makkaa turan** (The pilgrims were in Mecca for pilgrimage). While technically true, option C is more specific and accurate. The text mentions they were on their journey *to* Mecca for Hajj, not just *in* Mecca for pilgrimage.
* **B: Keessummoonni tokko tokko lammiilee naannoo miti** (The pilgrims were not all people from the region).  The text mentions that many of the hostel's guests were from the UAE, implying they *were* from other regions.
* **D: Keessummoonni harki caalan magaala qulqullittii irraayi** (The pilgrims were visiting the holy city as tourists). The text clearly states they were there for Hajj, not tourism.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, himoota armaan gadii keessaa kamtu dhugaadha?","The correct answer is **C: Keessummoonni jala bultii deemsa hajiitif achi turan (They were there for the Hajj pilgrimage).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Gamoon kun namoota jilarra jiran, kanneen jalbultii imala hajjiitti magaalaa qulqullittii daawachuuf dhufan hedduu qabate.""  This translates to: ""These people are pilgrims, of whom a large number came to visit the holy city for the pilgrimage to Hajj.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Balaan du’aa homtuu hin turre (The reason was not prayer):** The text clearly states they were there for the Hajj.
* **B: Keessummoonni hundinuu Yunaayitid Arab Emireetsi irraayi (All the pilgrims were from the United Arab Emirates):** The text says ""hosteelichaa baayyinaan lammiilee Gamtaa Emireetota Arabaati,"" meaning ""The hostel was mainly occupied by people from the Gamta of the United Arab Emirates."" This indicates a *majority* but not necessarily *all* were from the UAE.
* **D: Keessummoonni harki caalan Makkaadha (The pilgrims were natives of Mecca):**  Pilgrims generally come *to* Mecca, they aren't natives. The text describes them as *visiting* Mecca for Hajj.



"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, waa’ee walitti bu’iinsaa (collision) odeeffannoon shakkii hin qabne maali?","The correct answer is **A: Guddina walitti bu’iinsaa (Collision Dynamics)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists believe the collision was caused by a very large sheet of ice. It also mentions research efforts to understand the collision's dynamics and how the ice sheet impacted the Earth. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the collision is the core focus of the research and a key aspect of the reliable information available.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Bakka walitti bu’iinsi itti uumame (Location of the collision):** While the location is important, the passage doesn't explicitly state that the location is a well-known or confirmed piece of information.
*   **C: Dhiibbaa walitti bu’iinsichaa lafa irratti (Impact of the collision on the Earth):** The passage mentions the impact, but the question asks for *reliable information* about the collision itself, not just the impact.
*   **D: Bakka caccabaa itti argamu (Location of the research finding):** This refers to where the research is being conducted, not the collision itself.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee walitti bu’iinsaa ilaalchisee ammayyuu waanti murtaa’uu barbaadu maalidha?","The correct answer is **C: Akkaatan itti bu’aa xinxaala karoorsan ni qoodama** (The data from the planned search is being collected).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jarrii burkutaa’i sun hagam akka guddaa turee fi akkamitti Lafti akka hubamtuus murteessuuf ammallee yaalaa jiru. Ajaji Tarsiimaawaan Yuunaayitid Isteetsi kan waajjira Muummee Ittisa Biyyaa caccabaa isaa hordofaa jira.""  This translates to: ""The research team has been working hard and is trying to understand how the Earth was formed.  The NASA, through its Earth Science Division, is collecting data from its mission.""

The question asks what the passage indicates is the crucial thing being sought after, *considering the joint effort*. The passage explicitly mentions that NASA is collecting data from its mission to understand the Earth's formation.  Therefore, collecting the planned data is the key element in addressing the mystery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Caccabaa isaa barbaaduu eenyu akka gaggeessu (How to carry out its data collection):** While important, the passage focuses on *the data collection itself* as the crucial element, not the process of carrying it out.
* **B: Yeroo walitti bu’iinsi uumamu saatalaayitoonni sun saffisa isaan ittiin deemaa turan (During the joint effort, the satellites were moving at a certain speed):**  The passage mentions satellites, but their speed isn't the core concern. The core concern is the *data they are collecting*.
* **D: Hanga miidhaa qaqqabe isa sirrii (How to write the correct data):**  The passage doesn't discuss data writing or correct data. It talks about *collecting* the data in the first place.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, tarree Dureeyyii Ameerikaa keessatti yeroo tokko Battten meeqaffaa ture?","The correct answer is **C: 190ffaa**.

The question asks about the year Batten was ""in the news"" in America. The text states: ""Bateen 190ffaa irra ka’amee ture bara 2008’ti..."" which translates to ""Batten was in the news as early as 190ffaa in 2008...""

Therefore, the answer is 190ffaa.
"

The text states: ""Inni bara 1950 koolleejjii Aartiifi Saayinsii Yuunivarsiitii Viirjiiniyaatii eebbifame..."" which translates to ""He was educated at the College of Arts and Sciences, University of Virginia in 1950...""

Therefore, the question ""Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Batten kamiif arjoome?"" (Which institution did Batten graduate from?) is answered by the University of Virginia.
"
Qaama labsii Bulchaa Arnoold Shawaarzingar mallatteesse kan hin taane maalidha?,"The correct answer is **D: Viidiyoowwan haleellaa irratti dizaayinii (decal) gaafachuu.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Arnold Schwarzenegger *proposed* a $1000 fine for placing ""18"" decals on vehicles that are used to film pornography in California.  Option D accurately reflects this proposal – the use of decals on vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Guutummaa Kaalifoorniyaa keessatti viidiyoon waa’ee haleellaa ijoollee umuriin hin geenyetti akka hin gurguramne dhorkuu:** While the proposal relates to pornography, the passage doesn't say it's about *all* pornography filming in California. It specifically targets vehicles used for it.
* **B: Warra seera cabsaniif adabbii maallaqaa:** While a fine is mentioned, option B is too general. It doesn't pinpoint the specific action the fine is for.
* **C: Kaalifoorniyaan alatti viidiyoon waa’ee haleellaa ijoollee umuriin hin geenyetti akka hin gurguramne dhorkuu:**  The passage states this is a proposal *within* California, not something happening elsewhere.

"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waan jedhamaa ture eenyutu hin dhagahin ture?","The correct answer is **C: Miilar**.

The passage states: ""Miiler, isa oduchi isaan walqabate, irratti yaadannoo guddaa hin dhiisne."" (Miiler, who was his companion, did not give much thought to this.) and ""Maayikiin yeroo caqasamuu baay’ee hasa’aa ture..waan inni jedhaa ture akkan hin dhageenyetti qophaa’aan ture."" (Mike was very annoyed... he didn't understand what he was saying properly.)

The question asks who didn't understand what was being said. The passage indicates Miiler didn't understand what Mike was saying.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa dhaddacha (hearing) irratti muuxannoo Miilar ilaalchisee hima kamtu dhugaadha?","The correct answer is **B: Yeroo inni qophaa’aa ture yaada itti kennaa hin turre** (When he was trying to give an answer, he couldn't remember what Michael said).

Here's why:

* The passage states that Duuvaal was asked to share a memory.
* Miiler's response indicates that he *was* trying to recall something Michael said, but he couldn't quite remember it clearly.  He says, ""...I couldn't quite understand what he said.""
* Option B directly reflects this inability to recall the exact words.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeroo dhaddachaa Duuval miira Miilar hawwateera** (When listening, Duuvaal understood Miiler's meaning). The passage implies Duuvaal *didn't* fully understand Miiler's meaning, leading to the question.
* **C: Yeroo dhaddachaa ijoollen Duuvaal lamaan baay’ee haasa’an** (While listening, the two children talked a lot). The passage doesn't mention them talking a lot.
* **D: Seenaa Duuvaal qalbiin dhaggeeffataa ture** (The story, Duuvaal's heart, was listening). This is a metaphorical statement and not a direct reflection of what Miiler's response signifies about his memory.

(Minister of Finance John Howarth said that the action taken by the government by providing an additional amount of $45 million AUD to the Tasmanian government is only to provide assistance to prevent the hospital from decommissioning.)

This indicates that John Howarth addressed the Clean Air Act issue, specifically regarding the funding for the hospital.
"
Labsiin Qilleensa Qulqulluu filannoo dura akak ulaagatti itti dhimma bahamaa jira jechuun kan diede eenyudha?,"The correct answer is **C: Hogganaa NDP (NDP Leader)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Jaak Leeyitan, the leader of the NDP, took the position in the PMO and spoke about the federal government interfering with state laws and the Conservative party's desire to fully rewrite state laws. This directly links the issue to the NDP leader's concerns and actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Qondaala mootummaa naannoo (State Government Issue):** While the issue involves state laws and Tasmania's hospital, the *initial* concern and action highlighted in the passage comes from the NDP leader.
* **B: Muummicha Ministeeraa (Minister of the Crown):** Joon Haawaardi, the Minister of the Crown, offered a different perspective on the federal government's contribution. He wasn't the one initially raising the concerns.
* **D: Miseensa parlaamaa federaalaa (Federal Parliament Member):** While members of the Federal Parliament are involved, the passage specifically emphasizes the actions and statements of the NDP leader.

"
Qorattoonni Infireerd Ispeektirooskoppii maal ilaaluf itti fayyadamu?,"The correct answer is **A: Hojii kalee (Other activities)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that infrared spectroscopy was used to analyze the crystals found in the feces of domesticated animals. The passage implies this analysis helped the researchers understand ""other activities"" – specifically, how the crystals might be related to the animals' diet and health.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Waanta jajjabaataa fincaan bineensota manaa keessatti argamu (Shiny things found in domesticated animal feces):** While the crystals might be visually noticeable, the passage's focus is on the chemical composition, not just their appearance.
*   **C: Bineensota manaa ittiin qabaman (Domesticated animal materials used for grooming):** The passage doesn't mention anything about grooming materials.
*   **D: Nyaata bineensota manaa faalame (Feces of domesticated animals):** The passage states the crystals were *found* in the feces, but infrared spectroscopy was used to analyze the *crystals themselves*, not just the feces.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that infrared spectroscopy was used to analyze the crystals, which helped researchers understand other activities related to the animals' health and diet.

This translates to ""Dustin ""Gooldlast"" Raanels said, ""Luna has always been my partner, better than anyone...I love her, she is the best...she is in a better place.""

Therefore, Dustin Raanels attributed the ""Queen of Extreme"" title to Luna.
"
Luunaa akka “nama amala addaa” qabuutti kan fudhate eenyu?,"The correct answer is **B: Daastin Raanals**.

The text states: ""Dastiin """"Gooldlast"""" Raanels yaada kenneen """"Luunaan akkumakoo maraattuu turte, tarii anayyuu caalaa...nan jaaladha, isheen yaadas...iddoo irra gaarii jirti jedheen abdadha, """" jedhe."" This directly quotes Dustin Raanels saying Luna is ""better than us"" and that he ""loves her"" and thinks she's ""in a better place.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Deeggartoota ishee** - While her associates may agree with Dustin, the text specifically highlights his statement.
*   **C: Qorattoota mootummaa** - The text only mentions the writers of ""saanduqi gurraachi"" (likely a wrestling show), not their opinion on Luna.
*   **D: Toomii Diriimar** - Tommy Dreamer mentions Luna being his manager and good, but doesn't say she has a ""better than us"" quality."

Daandii balaan sun irratti raawwate yeroodhaaf cufamee ture yeroo gargaartonni yeroo balaa konkolaachisaa sana Audi TT diimaa san irraa adda baasan."" This translates to: ""However, the car's exterior was severely damaged. The rescue team worked for hours to remove the car, and rescuers pulled the Audi TT from the wreckage.""

The question asks what *didn't* happen in the accident. The text specifies that *none* of the people inside the vehicle were injured. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says the car's exterior was severely damaged, implying something *did* happen to the car.
*   **C:** The car was moved *to* the hospital in Cambridge, not *from* Cambridge.
*   **D:** The text mentions the rescue team removed the car, but doesn't state that employees (hijjattoota) were involved in extracting it.

Therefore, option B is the only one accurately supported by the text."
"Yeroo dorgommii raagbitti, waa’ee tapaha Afrikaa Kibbaa waanti bahee hin mul’anne maal ture?","The correct answer is **A: Hojii garee ajaa’ibsiisaa (Teamwork)**.

The text specifically states: ""Ittisi naamusa-qabeessi isaanii, dandeettiin kubbaa to’achuu fi **hojiin garee bareedaa isa kana akka ta’e ifaa ture**...""  This translates to ""Their sense of honor, their ability to catch the ball, and **their excellent teamwork shone through**...""

While the other options (ball-catching ability, the correct decision of the coach, and tackling ability) are mentioned as skills they displayed, the text emphasizes the *teamwork* as a key highlight of their performance.

This directly links the renewed unity of Southern African nations to the time they arrived in Zambia (26-00).  Therefore, the unity *began* after they arrived in Zambia.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naannoo 10:00 am:** The time 10:00 am is mentioned as the time of the match, not the beginning of the unity.
*   **B: Erga itftisa cimsanii booda:**  There is no reference to the end of the match being related to the unity.
*   **D: Dorgommiin osuma itti fufee jiruu:** The text indicates the unity started *after* they arrived in Zambia, not during the match.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Waggoota kurnaan dhufaan lama keessatti GDP’n Chaayinaa kan Yuunayiitid Isteetsi caaluu danda’a."" (In two decades, China's GDP can surpass that of the United States.) This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Erga jijjiiramni godhamee kaasee diinagdeen Chaayinaa saffisaan guddate** (After the reform, China's economy grew rapidly). While true, the passage focuses on the *scale* of the economic growth and the potential to surpass the US, not just the rapid growth itself.
* **B: Chaayinaan konkolaataa alatti erguun Yunaayit Isteetis caala gabaa guddaa qabdi** (By sending airplanes, the United States has a large surplus). The passage states China sent airplanes *to* the US and Germany, and that the US benefited from Chinese investment. It doesn't say the US has a surplus as a result.
* **D: Chaayinaan Jarman caalaa takkaa konkolaataa ergitee hin beektu** (It is unknown that China has sent more airplanes to Germany than Germany). The passage states China sent airplanes to *both* Germany and the US and that China sent *many* airplanes to both. It doesn't say the number sent to Germany is unknown.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, GDPn Chaayinaa yoom kan Yunaayitid Isteetis darba?","The correct answer is **Jijjiirama diinagdee dabalataa booda (After a significant economic reform)**.

Here's why:

The text states that China's economic reforms began under Deng Xiaoping, and that within a short period, China's economy grew rapidly, surpassing Germany and attracting significant investment from the US. It also mentions that China's GDP is projected to surpass that of the US in the coming decades. This implies a transformation driven by significant economic reforms, not a sudden event or a short timeframe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Waggaa digdama keessatti (In a short time):** While growth was rapid, the text implies a longer-term trajectory driven by reform.
*   **Gaggeessaa haaraa jalatti (In a new century):** The text doesn't specify a time frame in terms of centuries.
*   **Waggaa soddoma keessatti (In the next decade):** While the text suggests this will happen, it doesn't say it will happen within the next decade specifically. The overall tone is that of a longer-term trend.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **Jijjiirama diinagdee dabalataa booda.**"
Biyyoonni guddataa jiran ni godhuu jedhee Hu kan yaada kenne maalidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Gulantaa guddina isaanii kan ol butu itti gaafatamummaa fudhachuu qabu.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""biyyootni guddataa jiran """"daandii dulloomaa jalqaba faalanii achiin booda qulqulleessuu akka baqatan"""" jajjabeesse.""  This translates to ""the major countries have expressed that they will 'fully implement the commitment made at the beginning of the pandemic' afterwards.""  And the following sentence says: ""akkas jedhee itti dabale “gochuu hin qaban, haa ta’uu iyuu malee, dirqamaa sadarka guddina isaanii irratti akka fudhatan gaafatamuu, itti gaafatamumma fi dandetti.”"" which means ""and added “without any hesitation, they should fulfill their commitments at the level of their development, their capacity and ability.”""

Therefore, Hu Jintao is saying that major countries should **fully implement their commitments related to their development level, capacity, and ability.** This is best captured by option A: ""Gulantaa guddina isaanii kan ol butu itti gaafatamummaa fudhachuu qabu"" which means ""should fulfill commitments at the level of their development.""



The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bu’aa diinagdee irratti xiyyeeffachuu** (Focusing on economic gains) - While economic gains are a factor, the passage is more about fulfilling commitments made during the pandemic.
*   **C: Itti gaafatamummaa amma qaban gararraatti hojjachuu** (Implementing current capabilities) - The passage mentions capabilities *at the level of development*, so this is too narrow.
*   **D: Daandii faalama durii dhiisuu** (Discarding the initial commitment) - The passage says they will *fully implement* the commitment.



"
Waanti Hu hin eerin maalidha?,"The correct answer is **A: Hir’isuudhaf bu’uura (basis for the cuts)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Hu didn't specify the **basis for the cuts** (waanti hir’isuudhaf bu’uura). He mentioned that China's GDP would be determined by the amount of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in 2020, and that major countries would start reducing emissions after a certain point. However, he **didn't say *why* the cuts were being made or what the specific basis for the target was.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Faalama ilaalchisee biyyoota guddataa jiranii gorsa kennuu** - Hu *did* mention major countries and their plans to reduce emissions.
*   **C: Aarri kaarbonii guyyaa itti dhaabbata jedhamee abdatamu** - The text doesn't mention a carbon price or any future carbon pricing mechanisms.
*   **D: Hanga ykn lakkoofsa hanga aara kaarbonii cituu ykn dhaabbatuu** - The text *does* mention a target for carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP.

Therefore, the only thing Hu *didn't* specify was the fundamental reason or *basis* for the carbon emission cuts.

Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamiif Veerman haalichi gaarii hin turre kan jedhe?,"The correct answer is **B: Angoolaa**.

The quote states: ""Angoolaan gara ka’umsa dhukkubaa isa kanaan duraa caalaa ammaataatti adeemaa jirti, haalichi immoo Angoolaa keessatti baay’ee badaa ta’ee itti fufa."" which translates to: ""Angles are operating better than before with this disease, but the situation in Angles is very bad."""
"Qorannaa irraa kan ka’e, bakka Kaabinee Huhne kan fudhatu eenyudha?","The correct answer is **A: Deevii**.

The text states: ""Huhineen gadhiiseera kanaaf Kaabinee keessatti Miseensa Paarlaaamaa **Iid Deeviitiin** bakka buusama."" This translates to: ""For this shocking admission, Parliamentary Secretary **David** has been summoned to the Cabinet.""
"
Qorannoo booda bakka Ministeer Biizinasii kan fudhatu eenyudha?,"The correct answer is **A: Laamb**.

The text states: ""Miseensi Paarlaaamaa Noorman Laambi, bakka hojii duwwaa ministeera biizinasii Deeviin uumame akka fudhatan ni eegama."" which translates to ""Parliamentary Secretary Noorman Laambi is asked to approve the establishment of the new Business Minister's office.""

Yeroo opeeraa Kamiilaa Saint-Saens warri agarsiisa agarsiisan daawwattooni maal akka godhan jajjabeessu?,"The correct answer is **C: Waltajjiirratti bahanii isaan wajjin agarsiisa irratti hirmaatan (They went to the stage and participated in the performance with them).**

The text states: ""sababasaaf, namootni agarsiisa taphatan baala sammuu nama adoochu waltajjiirratti xuuxuu jalqaban akkasumas diraamichi mantaasaayyuu daawwattootni akka itti dabalamaniif isaan kakaase.""  This translates to: ""Therefore, because the artist's passion for writing and Japan led him, the performers went on stage and participated in the performance with him, and the drama was encouraged by the audience to continue.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kanabisii fudhachuu keessatti akka hirmaatan (Participating by consuming cannabis):** The text mentions the artist's passion for writing and Japan, not drug use.
* **B: Gara Jaappan akka deeman (Going to Japan):**  While the artist's passion for Japan *influenced* the situation, the audience didn't actually go to Japan. They participated *with* the artist on stage.
* **D: Jireenyi isaanii waan jaalataniin akka gaggeeffamu hayyamuu (Allowing their passion to be fulfilled):** While this is *partially* true (their passion *was* fulfilled), the text describes a more active participation – they *joined* the performance on stage.



"
Yeroo oppeeraa addumatti eenyutu maaruwaanaa aarsa?,"The correct answer is **A: Artistii sana (That artist)**.

The passage states that the artist (who wrote the libretto and went to Japan) caused the audience to cry and react emotionally during the opera. Therefore, the artist is the one who caused the emotional response.
"
“Hawaa keessa deemuu (spacewalk)” kan Liyoonov agarsiise maqaan biraa maal jedhama?,"The correct answer is **C: Hojii konkolataa hawaatin alatti hojjatamu (Extravehicular activity)**.

The text states: ""Bitootessa 18, 1965, yeroo jalqabaaf gochaa konkolataan alaa raawwate (EVA) yookaan “deemsa hawwaarraa” konkolaataa hawaatiin ala qobaa daqiiqaawwan 12 oliif turuun."" This directly translates to ""On March 18, 1965, for the first time, a spacewalk (EVA) was performed for more than 12 minutes.""  EVA is the acronym for Extravehicular Activity.  ""Deemsa hawwaarraa"" is the Amharic translation for spacewalk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ergama Apollo-Soyuz:**  This is a mission *following* the first spacewalk, not the name for the spacewalk itself.
* **B: Dorgommii Hawaaa:** This is a general term for ""air activity"" and not a specific term for a spacewalk.
* **D: Koosmoonot Lakk. 11:** This refers to the spacecraft, not the activity performed outside of it.



"
Leyoonov kutaa ergama Sooviyeetii kam durse?,"The correct answer is **C: Koosmoonot Lakk. 11**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bitootessa 18, 1965, yeroo jalqabaaf gochaa konkolataan alaa raawwate (EVA) yookaan “deemsa hawwaarraa” konkolaataa hawaatiin ala qobaa daqiiqaawwan 12 oliif turuun. Hojii isaatiif, kabaja ol-aanaa Sooviyeet Yuuniyen kan ta’e “Goota Sooviyeet Yuuniyen” argateera."" This describes the mission of Cosmonaut #11.

While the other options are related, they are not the *primary* answer to the question of which mission/group Leyoonov was a part of.
"
Walitti bu’iinsa (crash) sana keessatti eenyutu miidhame?,"The correct answer is **A: Giibsan**.

The text states: ""Erga balaan uumamee, Giibsen gara hospitaalaatti geeffamus yeroo muraasa booddee lubbuunsaa darbeera."" This translates to ""After the crash occurred, the Gibson was taken to the hospital and died shortly after.""
"
Namoota balaan irra gahe sana maaltu isaanirra gahe?,"The correct answer is **B: Tokko miidhamee, tokko du’e** (One was injured, one died).

The text states: ""Namatchi mana suphaa konkolaataa hojjetu sun bakka balaan itti qaqqabe sana ture innis akkas jedhe “daa’imman daandii qaxxaamuruuf dhaabbataa turan isaanis iyya dhageessisaafi boo’aa turan” jedhe. Isaan hunduu bakka balaan qaqqabee ture irraa fiigichaan deebi’an.""

This translates to: ""The toilet worker who witnessed the accident said, 'The floor was shaking, we were scared and screaming. They were all screaming and crying from where they had fallen.' ""

The key phrase is ""tokko miidhamee, tokko du’e"" (one was injured, one died).  While the text emphasizes screaming and fear, the direct information provided is about the injuries sustained.
"
Saayintistoonni saganticha irratti hojjatan mijidhawwan isaan ilaaluu barbaadan wantoota armaan gadii keessaa kamiin kan dhufaniidha?,"The correct answer is **C: Partikiloota xixiqqoo (Tiny particles)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tiyooriin kun maateriin baay’ee gurraachi naannoo Gaalaksii kan argaman naannoo gaalaksii haala haalootiini jedha, paartikiloota xixiqqoo hedduu irraas tolchame.""  This translates to: ""This theory suggests that much of the matter in the galaxy that we observe is in a region of the galaxy called the halo, made up of extremely small particles.""

While the other options are related to the universe, the text directly focuses on the discovery/analysis of tiny particles.
"
Wantoota armaan gadii keessaa saayintistoonni maatarii kamii ilaalaa turan?,"The correct answer is **D: Galaaksii Sagitaariyas fi Milkii Weeyii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bu’aa gareen barbaachaa ture , humna dambalii maatarii gurraa galaaksichaa fi maatarii gurraachaa Milk Weeyiin uumame."" This translates to: ""The result was the creation of matter from the gravitational forces of the galaxy and the Milky Way.""  Therefore, scientists were looking at the Milky Way and the Sagittarius galaxy.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, warra konsarvaativiitin maaltu hin qeeqamne?","The correct answer is **B: Hanqina tattaaffii deebisanii ijaaruu**.

Here's why:

The text states that Falmichi's statement pleased conservatives because he emphasized ""returning to the policies of the Bush administration."" Conservatives are generally in favor of restricting abortion. The text explicitly mentions that the conservatives were pleased with the emphasis on *restricting* abortion. Options A, C, and D don't reflect the conservative viewpoint as strongly as option B does.
"
Tattaffii gargaarsa Haarikeen Kaatiriinif eenyutu kontiraatwwan irra deebisanii ijaaruu komataa jira?,"The correct answer is **A: Konsarvatiivota fiiskaalii (Fiscal Conservatives)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kan galiin konservaatotaa gammachuun “Waliigaltee Niwu Oorliinsii Buush” jechuun kahan."" This translates to ""with the approval of fiscal conservatives, referred to as the Bush Bailout.""  The passage then goes on to say they were focused on the bailout of the financial industry.

Therefore, the fiscal conservatives were the group who supported the bailout that Hurricane Katrina exposed.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, ifni konkolaataa hawaa Istaardast (Stardust spacecraft) jalqaba eessatti mul’ata?","The correct answer is **B: Kaalifoorniyaa Kaabaa**.

The passage states: ""...gara ganama keessaa sa’aatii 5’tti (yeroo warra baha), namoota Kaaliforniyaa Kaabaa, Oreegoon, Nevaada, fi Utaah jiraataniif agarsiisa baay’ee ifaa kenna."" This indicates that the Stardust spacecraft's light was first observed in Southern California.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, wantoota armaan gadii keessaa konkolaatan hawaa rikardii kan galmeessu kamiifi?","The correct answer is **C: Dafee gara Lafaatti deebi’uu**.

The passage states: ""Istardastiin imaltuu hawwaa saffisa hunda caaluun gara Lafaatti deebite ta’uu isiitiin qabxii yeroo hunda haarawa galmeessuuf jetti..."" which translates to ""The space shuttle, with its maximum speed, returned to Earth, earning a total of four times the time..."" This directly refers to returning to Earth.

While the shuttle did shine brightly (B), travel between cities (D), and travel at a certain speed (D), the most significant and overarching event described is its return to Earth. The other options are details supporting the main event of returning to Earth.
"
"Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, Saroja Balasubramanian dhaaf maalidha?","The correct answer is **A: Obboleettii (Sister)**.

The text states ""Reeffa Saroojaa Balasubramaniyaan, umurii 53, kan uffata halkanii dhiigaan makameen marame argan.""  ""Reeffa"" translates to ""wife"" or ""spouse,"" but the context clarifies the relationship.  The question asks for the relationship between Dr. Malar Balasubramanian and Saroojaa Balasubramanian. The answer is ""obboleettii"" which means ""sister"" in Oromo.
"
Reeffi Sara Balasubramanian eessaa argame?,"The correct answer is **C: Duddeeba konkolaataa (trunk) keessa**.

The text states: ""...effa Saroojaa Balasubramaniyaan, umurii 53, kan uffata halkanii dhiigaan makameen marame argan. Reeffichi naannoo guyyaa tokkootiif achi akka oole ni mullata jedhe poolisiin."" This translates to: ""...the wife Saroojaa Balasubramanian, age 53, was found dead with gunshot wounds. Police believe the wife had been in the area for a day.""  Earlier in the passage it says the body was found in the trunk of their car.
"
eBay dhaan maaltu bitame ykn dhuunfatame?,"The correct answer is **C: Iskaayippii**.

The text states that eBay uses Skype in regions like China, Western Europe, and Brazil to facilitate business and gain public knowledge.  Skype is a platform for video conferencing and communication, which aligns with the purpose described.

The question asks what company eBay *uses*.  Skype is a product of **Microsoft**, but the options list Skype directly.
"
Waan argateen eBay maal galmaan gahuu barbaada?,"The correct answer is **C: Maqaa isaa guddisuu (To increase its brand)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that eBay is using Skype's presence in key regions (China, Western Europe, Brazil) to facilitate business growth and gain public knowledge. This implies eBay is aiming to expand its reach and visibility, ultimately strengthening its brand.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Galii isaa dhuunfachuu (To reduce its investment)** - The paragraph focuses on *increasing* business and public awareness, not cutting back on investment.
*   **B: Bakka haaratti babal’achuu (To relocate to a cheaper place)** - The paragraph mentions geographical expansion, not relocation.
*   **D: Warra keessaa qooda qaban (shareholders) gammachiisuu (To please its shareholders)** - While increasing brand value *can* benefit shareholders, the primary focus of the passage is on market expansion and public awareness. It's not the direct goal mentioned.



Therefore, increasing its brand is the most logical conclusion based on the provided text."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, erga lolli ka’ee booda namoota mana hidhaa keessa jiran wajjin kan hin dubbanne eenyu?","The correct answer is **B: Hojjattoota ittisa balaa abiddaa (Emergency response workers)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Battaluma, ogeesonni meeshaa okkora bittimsuuf fayyadan qabatanii mooraa galanii hidhamtoota gaasii imimmaan boochisuun dawootti naqan . Hojjattootni baraaruu balaa abiddaa dhumarratti sa’a 11:35 pm tti ibiddicha dhaamsan.""  This translates to: ""Quickly, the emergency responders, using the equipment they had, entered the ward and began to evacuate the patients due to the fire and administer medicine.  Emergency response workers reported the incident at 11:35 pm.""

Therefore, the emergency response workers were the first to interact with the patients inside the hospital ward after the fire started. They were the ones who evacuated them and provided initial medical assistance. The question asks who they interacted with *after* the fire started, and the emergency response workers were the first to do so.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa hidhamtoonni hokkara akka dhiisan kan taasise maalidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Gaasii imimmaanessu (Bleeding)**.

The text states: ""Battaluma, ogeesonni meeshaa okkora bittimsuuf fayyadan qabatanii mooraa galanii hidhamtoota gaasii imimmaan boochisuun dawootti naqan."" This translates to: ""However, the paramedics, using a combination of tools, entered the room and stopped the bleeding of the injured people with medicine.""

Therefore, the text explicitly mentions that bleeding was the issue that needed to be addressed.
"
"Akka yaada Ayaatolah Ali Khameenitti, Iraan maal irraa bilisa of-gochuu qabdi?","The correct answer is **B: Warraaqsa Islaamaa (Islamic civilization)**.

The text states: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, maxxantummaa zayita irrattii akka “qabduu” warraaqsi Islaamummaa Iraan bara 1979 duraa eegalee kan turee fi kan biyyattiin irraa bilisa of baasuu qabduutti ibsan."" This translates to: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the oil embargo was a ""captivity"" of the Islamic civilization of Iran, which existed before the 1979 revolution and the country's separation from its heritage.""

Therefore, Ayatollah Khamenei believes Iran has a ""captivity"" related to its Islamic civilization.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, dhiibbaa qoqqobbiin diinagdee Iraanirratti geessise kan amane eenyudha?","The correct answer is **C: Ayaatolah Ali Khameenii**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ... ibsan maxxantummaa zayita irrattii akka “qabduu” warraaqsi Islaamummaa Iraan bara 1979 duraa eegalee kan turee fi kan biyyattiin irraa bilisa of baasuu qabduutti ibsan."" This translates to: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei... stated that the oil is a ""captivity"" of the Islamic nation of Iran, which existed before the 1979 revolution and which the country must free itself from.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maddeen olaanoo (The oil market)** - While the oil market is affected, the text focuses on Khamenei's statement.
* **B: OPEC** - OPEC's actions are mentioned as a factor in oil production, but Khamenei's statement is the primary focus regarding the *belief* in the captivity of oil.
* **D: Gamtaa Awurooppaa (European Union)** - The EU's sanctions are mentioned as a consequence, but Khamenei's viewpoint is what the question is asking about.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qaama adeemsa filannoo Faransaayi kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Galmee filannoorratti mallatteessuu (Representing on ballot papers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that voters place a ballot paper into a ballot box.  This implies that the ballot paper *represents* the voter's choice within the ballot box.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Korojoo filannoo haqa qabeessa (Authorized ballot boxes):** The passage mentions ballot boxes, but not the authorization of the boxes themselves as a unique aspect of the French voting system.
* **B: Bakka bu’oota kaadhimamaan ergaman (The locations where officials arrive):** The passage states that officials visit hospitals, but doesn't highlight the locations *where they arrive* as a distinctive feature.
* **D: Sagalee bakka bu’oota kaadhimamaatin lakkaa’amu (The number of locations where officials arrive):** Similar to option B, the passage mentions officials visiting hospitals, but doesn't emphasize the *number* of those locations as a unique element.



Therefore, the ability to **represent** a voter's choice on a ballot paper is a key aspect of the French voting system described in the passage.



"
Warri sagalee kennan kaadhimamaa isaanii eessatti filatu?,"The correct answer is **C: Poostaa irratti** (By Mail).

The text describes how voters in France used to cast their ballots by inserting a ballot paper into a ballot box. The ballot boxes were then collected by election officials. This entire process is a mail-based voting system.
"
Waggaa saddeetif akka Musaashii barbaaduf maaltu Alan kakaase?,"The correct answer is **C: Invsetimentii isaa qaama bishaan qorachuu marine exploration) irratti**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Allen ""dhangalaasuun hojaatu hojii aloolaa galaanarraati ammamoo fedhii lolaa bara jieenyasaa guutuu qabuuf Musaashii baasuf karaa barbaadu jalqabeera."" This translates to ""He [Allen] started searching for Musashi, using his vast financial resources and the ability to perform ocean floor surveys using ROVs.""

This indicates that Allen's motivation for searching for Musashi for eight years was his investment in marine exploration capabilities, specifically the ability to map the ocean floor.  The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Qabeenya isaa (His knowledge):** While Allen likely had knowledge, the passage emphasizes his financial resources.
*   **B: Garaa bishaanii jala qorachuuf (For seabed mapping):**  While seabed mapping is mentioned as a tool *used*, it's the underlying investment in marine exploration that drove the search.
*   **D: Fedhii inni waraanicharratti qabu (His ability in combat):** There is no mention of Allen's combat abilities in the passage.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Alan maallaqa isaa guddaa maal irratti baase?","The correct answer is **A: Mustaashii iddootti deebisuu (Returning Musashi's mustache to its place)**.

The text states: ""...Allen, kan maallaqaa isaa guddaa irratti dhangalaasuun hojaatu hojii aloolaa galaanarraati ammamoo fedhii lolaa bara jieenyasaa guutuu qabuuf Musaashii baasuf...""  This translates to ""...Allen, by focusing on his greatest pride (maallaqaa isaa guddaa), he embarked on a difficult task to return Musashi's mustache...""



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa warshicha keessa fi naannoo isaatti haala balaa qabuuti kan geessuu malu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Boba’aa yuraaniyeemii (Uranium waste)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""hoggantoonni tilmaamanitti kontiineeriin boba’aa yuraniiyem baatuu kun bakkeetti tarii uratee akkasumas yaaseera ta’a"" which translates to ""According to the authorities, the container of uranium waste was transported to a remote area and buried.""  The passage links the uranium waste to the potential for a disaster.

While Cesium and Iodine are radioactive, the text highlights the uranium waste specifically as the source of concern.  The other options (radium, iodine) are mentioned as being present, but the focus of the disaster concern is the uranium waste.



Therefore, the uranium waste is the most direct and explicitly stated cause of the potential disaster in the text.
"
Taatee warshitti mudate hordofee kanneen armaan gadii keessaa odeeffannoo of-eeggannoo jiraattota naannotiif kenname kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Aara adii gara keessatti fudhachuu dhiisuu (Refrain from taking water from the well)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that authorities have warned residents *not to drink well water* (""haaromsituu qilleensaa cufaa akkasumas bishaan uujummoo hin dhuginaa"").  Option C directly reflects this warning.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Yuunitiiwwan qilleensa galchuuf oolan itti fayyadamuu dhiisuu (Refrain from using units used to receive parcels):** The text doesn't mention anything about avoiding units used for receiving parcels.
*   **B: Mana keessa turuu (Staying indoors):** The text doesn't explicitly state that people should stay indoors, though it's a reasonable precaution given the context.
*   **D: Bishaan boonbaa dhuguu dhiisuu (Refrain from detonating bombs):** There is no mention of bombs being detonated.



"
"Akkaataa Dr. Moolitti, waa’ee XDR-TB waanti baay’ee yaaddessaan maalidha?","The correct answer is **C: Namni qabame tokko lakkoofsa namoota inni qabsiisuu danda’uu (The number of people one infected person can infect).**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the alarming rate of transmission of XDR-TB. Dr. Mool states that one person with XDR-TB can infect 10-15 people within a year. This high infectivity rate is what makes XDR-TB so concerning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vaayirantii hospitaala keessatti nama qabaa jiru (The virus exists in hospitals):** While XDR-TB can be found in hospitals, the existence of the virus alone isn't the primary concern. The concern is its ability to spread.
*   **B: Vaayirantichi qoricha baruu isaa (The virus's way of spreading):** The passage doesn't focus on the *mechanism* of transmission, but rather the *extent* of transmission.
*   **D: Hanga inni ajjeesu (How it works):** The passage doesn't delve into the biological workings of the virus.

Therefore, the passage highlights the concerning ability of a single infected person to spread the disease to many others, making option C the most accurate answer."
Namoota dhibicha ykn vaayiraantidhaan qabaman keessaa meeqaa isaanitu ogeeyyii fayyaati?,"The correct answer is **A: 10**.

The text states: ""Turtii waggaa tokkoo keessatti, namni faalamaan tokko nama quunnamtii dhiyeenyaa faana qabu 10 hanga 15 faaluu mala.""  This translates to: ""Within a year, someone who has close contact with a patient with tuberculosis is 10 to 15 times more likely to contract the disease.""
"
Sistamni NextGen teeknolojii akkamii fayyadama?,"The correct answer is **C: Teeknolojii raadarii lafarra jirurratti hundaa’e (Ground radar technology)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...teeknolojii Sataalayitii irratti hunda’u fayyadamaa akka fallaa teekinoolojii lafa irra radarii duriiti akka kanneen qilleensa biyyaa to’atan sirritti bakka xiyyaarri jiran sirritti himu...""  This translates to ""...using satellite technology to implement ground radar technology to accurately identify the location of fires...""

While satellite technology is involved, the core technology mentioned for pinpointing fire locations is ground-based radar. Therefore, option C is the most accurate. Options A and B are too general, and option D is incorrect as it discusses carbon emission, not the technology used for fire detection.



"
NextGen akkamitti kanneen geejjiba qilleensarraa to’atan gargaara?,"The best answer is **B: Bakka argama balalii baay’ee sirrii ta’e (Accurate location of pollution)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that NextGen uses satellite technology and remote sensing to ""identify the location of pollution"" and provide ""real-time information to disaster responders.""
* While the other options might be *results* of NextGen's capabilities (like reduced carbon emissions), the core function described is identifying the location of pollution.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the *best* fit:

* **A: Daandiwwan balalii gabaabaa (Comprehensive pollution monitoring):** While NextGen *contributes* to comprehensive monitoring, the passage focuses on pinpointing the location.
* **C: Kaarban emishinii gadi bu’e (Reduced carbon emissions):** This is a potential benefit, but not the primary function described.  The passage focuses on *how* NextGen helps with disaster response, not the long-term environmental impact.
* **D: Boba’aa xiqqaa (Lower cost):** The passage doesn't mention cost savings.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, FBI irratti xiyyeeffachuu dhiisuusaaf kan qorattoonni seenaa qeeqan maalidha?","The correct answer is **B: Yakkoota salphaatti dhorkamuu danda’aniif bajata ramaduu**.

Here's why:

The text states that the story's focus on the FBI's shortcomings led Congress to allocate funds to help the agency improve its ability to solve criminal cases, particularly those involving advanced technology like ""makiinawwan haatamanii"" (presumably sophisticated machinery).  This implies the need for *more money* to address these challenges and solve crimes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hanga milkaa’ina isaanii guddisuu (Improving their performance):** While improving performance might be a *goal*, the text directly links the story's impact to allocating *funding* to enable that improvement.
*   **C: Dhimmoota fiilmiwwan saal-qunnamtii irratti xiyyeeffannoo guddaa kennuu (Focusing on investigation issues):** The text mentions investigating criminal cases, but doesn't specifically say that focusing on ""investigation issues"" led to the funding.
*   **D: Dhimmoota konkolaataa hatamanii (Focusing on specialized topics):** The text focuses on technology, not specialized topics.



"
Inisheetiivin waanta safuu gatee FBI maal akka godhu dirqisiisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Hanga milkaa’ina ejansichaa guddisuu** (To improve the agency's performance).

Here's why:

The passage states that the initiative was created to allow the FBI to address major threats by allocating more resources (budget) and to improve the agency's capabilities. The initiative specifically mentions things like advanced technologies (like automated machinery) and increasing the expertise of FBI agents.  All of these point to the goal of improving the FBI's overall performance and effectiveness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhimmoota konkolaataa hatamaniif risoorsii ykn bajata heddu ramaduu** (To allocate more resources or budget for major threats): While resource allocation is *part* of the initiative, it's not the overall *goal*.  It's a *means* to achieve a larger goal.
* **C: Yakkoota salphaatti furaman irratti xiyyeeffachuu** (To focus on solving open cases): The passage focuses on *preventing* future threats and improving overall capabilities, not specifically on solving old cases.
* **D: Ejantoonni dhimmoota fiilmii saal-qunnamtii irratti dhimmanii akka hojjatan gochuu** (To allow agents to work on film-related threats):  While film-related threats might be a type of threat the initiative addresses, it is not the main objective. The initiative is broader.



"
Konkolaataa balaa abiddaa walitti bu’iinsa ykn balaa JAS 39C Gripen tti qaqqabe irratti maaltu mudate ykn ta’e? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ni garagale** (It crashed).

The text states: ""Gripen JAS 39C karaa ka'uumsa bira naannoo sa'aatii biyya keessaa ganama keessaa 9.30(0230 UTC) tti kufee dhohe, buufata xiyyaarichaas balalii daladalaa'tti cufan."" This translates to: ""The Gripen JAS 39C crashed in the area at 9:30 am local time (0230 UTC), and its engines caught fire.""

Therefore, the aircraft crashed.
"
"JAS 39C Girpin caccabuu hordofee, buufanni xayyaarichaa kamiif cufaa ta’e?","The correct answer is **A: Balalii daldalaa (Market speculation)**.

The text states: ""Buufata xiyyaarichaas balalii daladalaa’tti cufan"" which translates to ""The stock market reacted with speculation"".
"
Yeroo Warraaksa Iraan Birezeziniskiin deeggarsa ykn qajeelfama eenyuf kenne?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaartar (Carter)**.

The text states: ""Yeroo filannoo bara 1976 tti, imaammata dhimma alaa irratti Kaartariin gorse, sana booda akka Gorsaa Nageenya Biyyoolessaatti (NSA) 1977 hanga 1981 tti Heenrii Kiisiinjeriin bakka bu’uudhaan tajaajile.""  This means Carter appointed Kissinger as NSA, and the passage then lists accomplishments *during Carter's presidency* related to the Iran hostage crisis.  Brezinski was a close advisor to Kennedy and Johnson, but the text connects the Iran hostage crisis specifically to Carter."
Haaga bara 1977 tti aangoo Gorsaa Nageenya Biyyaalessaa eenyutu qabatee ture?,"The correct answer is **B: Kisiingar (Kissinger)**.

The passage states: ""Yeroo filannoo bara 1976 tti, imaammata dhimma alaa irratti Kaartariin gorse, sana booda akka Gorsaa Nageenya Biyyoolessaatti (NSA) 1977 hanga 1981 tti Heenrii Kiisiinjeriin bakka bu’uudhaan tajaajile."" This translates to: ""In the 1976 election, Carter nominated a foreign policy advisor, who later became National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981 under Henry Kissinger.""

Therefore, Henry Kissinger was the NSA in 1977.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa turtii Boobek Partizan Beelgireed waliin qabu sirriitti kan hin ibsine kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Taphataa kamiyyuu caalaa galchii lakkoofsise.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yeroo garee isaa waliin turetti, tapha 468 taasisee keessatti galchii 403 galche.""  This translates to ""During his time with his unit, he made 468 kills and received 403 awards.""

Option B accurately reflects this information.  The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Yeroo garichaaf taphatu galchii 468 ol lakkoofsiseera** - This is just a restatement of one of the numbers.
*   **C: Yeroo tokko seenaa kilabichaa keessatti taphataa addaa jedhamee filatameera** - The text mentions being *chosen for his fighting spirit* within the Partizan ranks, but not being *chosen as the best fighter* in the club.
*   **D: Taphataa kamiyyuu caalaa taphoota heddu irratti hirmaatera** -  The text doesn't provide information on the *number* of kills compared to other activities, only the *total* number.



"
Seenaa Boobek kilaba Paartizan Beelgireed wajjin qabu ilaalchisee hima kamtu dhugaadha?,"The correct answer is **C: Hanga bara 1995 tti Paartizaniif taphate.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Inni bara 1945 isaanitti makamee hanga 1958 achi ture. Yeroo garee isaa waliin turetti, tapha 468 taasisee keessatti galchii 403 galche."" This translates to: ""He joined the ranks in 1945 and remained until 1958. During his time with the unit, he carried out 468 missions and received 403 awards.""
* The text also says: ""1995 tti, seenaa seenaa warra Paartizan keessatti inni akka taphata uurjiiti filatame."" This translates to: ""In 1995, he was recognized for his heroic deeds in the history of the Partisan people.""

Therefore, the key information is that he fought *until* 1995.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bara 1945 tti Paartizaniif taphachuu eegale (He started fighting for the Partisans in 1945):** While true, it doesn't encompass the entire duration of his involvement.
* **B: Paartizan Beelgireed dura Zaagireebif taphaatee ture (Before the Belgrade Partisans, he fought for Zagreb):** The text doesn't mention fighting for Zagreb before joining the Belgrade Partisans.
* **D: Taphataa cimaa Paartizan ta’ee erga filameen booda beekamtii argate (He gained recognition only after carrying out significant Partisan missions):**  The text states he was recognized *in* 1995 for his heroic deeds, implying recognition occurred during or after his service. Option C provides a broader timeframe for his service.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, amala kamtu Hesperonikas velooseraptar irraa adda godha?","The correct answer is **D: Dhiigni ykn teempireechara qaamaa hoo’aa qaba (warm blooded)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""kan dhiigi isaa kunakka veelookiraaptorii ol jedhee miilla lama deemaa ture jedhee miilla lama deemaa ture."" This translates to ""whose blood it is said to have been two million years ahead of the velociraptor.""  The key implication here is that its blood was warm-blooded, a characteristic that sets it apart from velociraptors, which are generally believed to have been cold-blooded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Miila lama qaba (Has two million years):** This is incorrect. The text states its blood was *two million years ahead* of the velociraptor, not that it *has* two million years.
* **B: Qeensa lammaffaa guddaa qaba (Has a large second toe):**  The text doesn't mention anything about the size of its second toe.
* **C: Qaama guutummaatti rifeensan haguugame qaba (Has a completely feathered body):** The text doesn't mention if it was feathered or not.

Therefore, the warm-blooded nature of Hesperonikas's blood is the differentiating factor mentioned in the text.
"
Hiikni jecha “Hesperonikas” qaama gosa bineensotaa kam irraa dhufe?,"The correct answer is **A: Qeensa(wwan)**.

The text states that the name ""Hesperonikas"" was given to the dinosaur because its ""hiikii isaa ""qoronyoo lixaa"""" which translates to ""six-toothed beak"". Therefore, the name comes from the beak.
"
Waa’ee dhukaasichaa ilaalchisee himoota armaan gadii keessa kamtu dhugaadha?,"The correct answer is **C: Abbaan warraafi haati warraa waggaa tokko dura Bufaalotti wal fuudhan**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Cimdootni sun wagga tokko dura Teeksaas keessatti wal fuudhanii hiriyootaa fi firoottan isaanii wajjin ayyaaneffachuf gara Baafaloo dhufan."" (These individuals had gathered in Texas a year ago with their livestock and belongings to settle in Buffalo.)
* The question asks what can be inferred from the description of the family.
* Option C directly reflects that past event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Abbbaan warraafi haati warraa lamaan isaanituu Teeksas irraayi** - The passage mentions a husband and wife, not two husbands and wives.
* **B: Namoota shantu miidhame** - The passage doesn't give any information about the number of people who died. It only mentions that one of the four sons died, and the wife did not remarry.
* **D: Dhukaasi Bufaalotti mudate** - The passage does not state that the family's loss occurred in Buffalo. It only states that they moved to Buffalo.



"
Waa’ee taatee bakka dhukaasi itti raawwatee ilaalchisee himni sirriin kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Sagantaa kabaja ayaana waggaa irratti Bufaaloo keessatti mudate** (The celebration of the new year took place in Buffalo).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Cimdootni sun wagga tokko dura Teeksaas keessatti wal fuudhanii hiriyootaa fi firoottan isaanii wajjin ayyaaneffachuf gara Baafaloo dhufan."" (These people gathered in Texas a year ago with their livestock and belongings to celebrate the new year and came to Buffalo.)
* The question asks where the celebration *took place*. 
* The text further clarifies: ""Sagantaa guyyan ayyaanaa waggaa seeraa guyya biraatti darbeera, aangawootni akka jedhanitti."" (The celebration of the new year took place a day before the end of the year, according to the elders.)
*  It then specifies the location: ""Bufaalootti dhalate..."" (Born in Buffalo...) referring to the husband.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Sagantaa kabaja ayyaana waggaa idilee irratti mudate** (The new year celebration took place in an internal community):  The text points to Buffalo as the specific location.
* **C: Teeksasitti paartii sagantaa ykn paartii irratti mudate** (The celebration party took place in Texas): The people moved *from* Texas *to* Buffalo for the celebration.
* **D: Sagantaa cidha kaadhimamtootaa irratti raawwate** (The celebration took place on the children's side): The text doesn't mention any specific side or group of children.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee Luno ilaalchisee aangawoota gidduutti shakkiin ykn yaaddon jalqabaa maal ture?","The correct answer is **A: Hanqina kaargoo xaa’oo (Fear of torpedo attacks)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dooniin meetira 100, karaa irra jira innis ba’aasaa yeroo maraa kan xaa’oo fe’u, jalqaba irraa aangawootni bo’oon doonicha irra jiru akka dhimmisuu danda’u sodaatan."" This translates to: ""The ship is 100 meters long, and it often encounters torpedoes, from the beginning, the crew on board are afraid that the torpedoes will sink the ship.""

Therefore, the initial concern or fear during the voyages was the threat of torpedo attacks.  The other options don't directly relate to the information provided.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee cabuu Luno ilaalchisee kan dhugaa hin taane kami?","The correct answer is **C: Miseensota garichaa kudha lama keesaa tokkotu miidhame (One of the two helicopters was damaged.)**

Here's why:

The text states that *only* the helicopters that crashed were damaged. It doesn't say any of the helicopters were damaged. It only says that the two helicopters crashed. Therefore, stating that one of the helicopters was damaged is an assumption not explicitly stated in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabuun kan mudate osoo kaargoo hin kaasin dura (The cargo was not unloaded before the crash):** The text doesn't mention anything about unloading cargo.
* **B: Yeroo cabu markabichi boba’aa meetira 100 qabatee ture (When crashing, the ship had a volume of 100 cubic meters):** The text explicitly states the ship's volume was between 120-160 cubic meters *before* the crash.
* **D: Markabichi gara qarqara bishaanitti dhiibame (The ship crashed on the ice):** The text states the ship crashed *near* the ice, but doesn't specify it crashed *on* the ice.



"
Aljeeriyaan jaarraa meeqaffaa keessa walabummaa argatte?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960 oota**.

The text states: ""Bara 1960moota keessa gara biyya haaraa bilisummaa argatte Aljeeriyaatti deebi’e..."" which translates to ""In the 1960s, he returned to Algeria, which gained independence...""
"
Sirna awwaalchatiif iskiriiniin televizhiinii eessatti hin kaa’amin?,"The correct answer is **A: Guutummaa Room (Throughout Rome)**.

The text states: ""Room keessatti bakka baay’eeti foddaa teelevizhiniin gurguddaa baayeen dhaabbataniiru akka ummatnii qophii sana ilaalaniif."" This translates to ""In Rome, many crowded places were equipped with loud televisions so that the people could enjoy the show.""  This implies the broadcast was widespread throughout Rome. While it was also shown in other European cities and Poland, the text specifically mentions the extensive use of televisions in Rome.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.
"
Sirni awwaalchaa eessatti gaggeeffame?,"The correct answer is **D: Jalqaba Room keessatti, sana booda magaalota Xaaliyaanii biroo keessattii.**

Here's why:

* The text states that the initial pilgrimage was to the Holy City of Addababayii Pheexiroos (St. Peter's).
* It then mentions that people in Rome were gathered to watch the event on television.
* Finally, it says the event was broadcast and watched in various European cities, including Poland.

Therefore, the pilgrimage started in Rome, then spread to other European cities. Options A and B are too limited. Option C only mentions the initial destination and not the wider reach.



"
"Dhohiinsa hordofee, miidhamni cimaan mudatee eenyutu yaalame?","The correct answer is **D: Ollaa**.

The text states: ""Miidhaan addaa hin gabaafamne, garuu yoo xiqqaate namootni shan mallattoo ofwallaalanii-kufuutiif wal’aanamaniru."" This translates to: ""The fire wasn't extinguished, but when it flared up, three people showed signs of being overwhelmed and looked at each other in alarm.""

Therefore, when the fire flared up, the **ollaa** (a type of pot or container) was the one that was involved. The text doesn't specify *what* was in the ollaa, just that it was involved in the fire.
"
Dhangala’uu gaazii ykn boba’aa eenyutu gabaase?,"The correct answer is **A: Ollaa gamicha keessa jiru (The owl inside the camp).**

The text explicitly states: ""Hoogganaan kaampaanii gaasii erga ollaan waa’ee mul’annoo yaa’uu gaasii bilibilan booda taatee sana gabaasaa ture"" which translates to ""The camp leader had been chasing the owl that appeared with a loud noise from the beginning."" This indicates the owl was the one who first disturbed the silence and led to the discovery of the body.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nama apaartimenticha keessa jiraaatu (The apartment residents):** The residents discovered the body after the apartment was broken into. They didn't initiate the discovery.
*   **C: Ogeessa kampanii boba’ichaa (The camp's night watchman):** The text mentions the camp leader, not the night watchman.
*   **D: Hogganaa gamoo sanaa (That camp leader):** While the leader was chasing the owl, the owl was the one who initially caused the disturbance. The leader didn't *discover* the body.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, haleellichaan namoota meeqatu du’e?","The answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""Meeshaan waraanaa Yuukaa wayita sammuu nama shanaffaatti aggaamametti argachuu hin dandeenye."" This translates to ""The war reporter Yucca was unable to identify six people among the victims.""  The question asks how many people died. Since Yucca couldn't identify *all* of them, and the question asks how many *died*, we assume the number of deaths is the total number mentioned. The text doesn't explicitly state the exact number of deaths, but the context implies that the number of deceased is connected to the fact that Yucca couldn't identify six people.  Since no other number is mentioned for the death toll, and we are looking for the *number of people who died*, we assume the number is related to the 6 that couldn't be identified.  Given the options, 4 is the most likely answer as it represents a plausible number of deaths within the context of a disaster.

However, there's a crucial detail:  The text says Yucca *couldn't identify* six people. It doesn't say *six people died*. The question is poorly phrased.  If we *must* choose from the given options, and interpreting ""how many people died?"" as ""what is the closest number to the number of people Yucca couldn't identify?"" then **A: 4** is the most reasonable (though still imperfect) choice.

If the question were ""How many people *were potentially* affected by the deaths?"", then a different interpretation would be necessary.

Given the limitations of the question and the provided answers, **A: 4** is the *least bad* option.



"
Yeroo haleellan gaggeeffamu sana meeshaa eenyutu dhukaasuu dide?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Meeshaan waraanaa Yuukaa wayita sammuu nama shanaffaatti aggaamametti argachuu hin dandeenye."" This translates to ""The Uka (presumably a person) couldn't recognize anyone in the crowd.""  The question asks who was suffering from the ordeal. The text then details Cuddeback's suffering.

Therefore, the answer is **Ukaa** because the text indicates the Uka was suffering from the ordeal of not being able to recognize anyone.
"
Gosa ispoortii armaan gadii keessaa sagantaa Olompikii keessaa akka bahu godhame kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Iskuwaashii**.

The text explicitly states: ""Iskuwaashiin, kaaraateenii fi rooleriin ispoortota akkuma beezboolii fi sooftibooli sagantaa Oolompikii keessa galuuf yaalaa turanii filannoodhaan Taphoora Olompiikii 2005 tii ala akka ta’an taasifamanidha."" (Sports like soccer, karate, and roller sports, just like baseball and softball, were selected to enter the Olympic Games through a selection process that was carried out before the 2005 Olympics.)

Therefore, soccer (iskuwaashii) is one of the sports mentioned as being selected for inclusion in the Olympics.
"
Ispoortiwwan armaan gadii keessaa Koreen Olompikii Idila-addunyaa taphicha keessatti akka hammatamu kan godhe kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Raagbii yuuniyeenii**.

The text states: ""Ragbii, keessumaa yuuniyeniin ragbii, akkasumaas golfiin taphoota biroo shankeessaa akka ispoortii Oolompikiitti dabalamaniif filataman."" (Rugby, including youth rugby, as well as golf, were chosen to be included as sports in the Olympics.)

While the other sports were discussed as having been considered, only youth rugby is specifically mentioned as being chosen.
"
Artar Giinas St Jeems Geet Biriwarii jalqaba waggaa meeqaf liizii godhe?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The text states: ""Waggaa 250 booda, Guinness’n dinagde addunyaati guddate..."" which translates to ""After 250 years, Guinness's wealth grew to become the largest in the world...""

Therefore, Guinness started its lease of St. James' Gate brewery 250 years after 1759 (the year mentioned in the question).
"
Giinas waggaa waggaan dolaara biiliyoona hangam ta’u fida ykn galcha?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

Here's why:

The question asks *how much* Guinness's revenue grows *annually*. The text states: ""Waggaa 250 booda, Guinness’n dinagde addunyaati guddate kan Yuuroo Biliiyoona 10 o argatu (US$14.7 biliiyoona) wagga waggaan."" This translates to: ""After 250 years, Guinness's revenue grew to earn Euro 10 Billion (US$14.7 billion) *annually*.""

Therefore, the annual growth is $14.7 billion. Option C (14) represents the closest part of that number that is provided in the options, and given that the question asks ""how much,"" the closest answer to the annual growth amount is 14.
"
Vaayirasiin H5N1 biyyoota Gamtaa Awurrooppaa meeqa keessatti mul’ate?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaha**.

The text states the virus was found in Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy. That's a total of six countries, and option B is the closest to that number. Since there are no options for 6, I will provide the answer as B. 

I apologize for the discrepancy.
"
Keezin H5N1 inni dhiyeenyaa eessatti argame?,"The correct answer is **A: Faransaayi**.

The text states: ""isa gaafa Wiixataa caffee Liyoonitti dhiyoo Faransaay bahaa keessaa keessatti argame..."" which translates to ""a bird was found inside a French home in Lyon in October...""
"
Osoo loltoonni nagaa eegdotaa hin daddabarsin dura Haaitin yeroo dhumaaf yoom dhibichi keessatti argame?,"The correct answer is **C: Kirkira lafaa dura**.

The text states: ""Osoo loltootni hin ga’iin dura, Haayitiim rakkootu mudatee dhukkubaa waliin wal qabachuun ergaa bara 1800 tii.""  This translates to: ""Before the earthquakes, Haiti had been suffering from problems and shared suffering since the year 1800.""
"
Bakka kam gara lixaatti argamutu dhibichi akka babal’atuuf gumaache?,"The correct answer is **A: Laga Artibonaayit (The Artibonite River)**.

The text states: ""Akka himata seeraatti, balfii kaampii mootumoota gamtoomanii irraa sirriitti hin qulqulloofne, Laga Aartiboonii laga guddaa haayitti keessa isa tokko kan ta’e yaa’utti akka baakteeriyaan seenuf sababa ta’eera.""  This translates to: ""According to reports, the water of the United Nations camp did not come from the Artibonite River, one of the major rivers of Haiti, and it is believed to be caused by bacteria.""

Therefore, the Artibonite River is identified as the source of the bacterial contamination that caused the illness.
"
Mootummaan Ayirish maal hojjachuuf karoorsaa jira?,"The correct answer is **B: Qorichi sammuu adoochu hayyamamuu ilaalchisee seerota caalmatti cimoo ta’an baasuu.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Amma lamaansaanii jechuunis fayyaa hawaasaa fi gama yakkaf murtoo kennamuf murteessa dha akkumaa raawwachisuun safiisa danda’ameen kennamuu qaba..."" This translates to ""But in two days, they must give a response to provide health and relief to the people...""  This implies establishing laws to address the issues.
* The text further mentions the Minister of Health: ""Miniisteerri fayyaa nagenyummaa namoota bu'aa yeroo seeraa fudhatani wantoota sammuu adoochan keessatti hirmaatanii fi amanamummaa qoricha waliin walqabtan fi qabataman erga jijjiiramootni haaraan heeraa-alaa bahee booda ta'aniif yaaddoo isaa mul'isee jira."" This translates to ""The Minister of Health, participating in matters related to the benefits of the law, and collaborating and trusting the lawyers, will make their opinion known after the elected members of parliament have passed the law."" This emphasizes the creation of laws *after* the parliament acts.

Therefore, the government is planning to pass laws to address the concerns of the people regarding the healthcare system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Warreen yakka qoricha sammuu adoochun shakkamanitti murtii dabarsuu** (Impose punishment on those suspected of poisoning).  While this might be *a consequence* of the new laws, it's not the *primary goal* the text outlines.
* **C: Hayyamamuu qoricha sammuu adoochuu ilaalchisee seerota laaffisuu** (Pass lenient laws regarding poisoning). The text implies a response and a solution, not leniency.
* **D: Qoricha sammuu adoochu yakkarraa bilisa gochuu** (Make poisoned food dangerous). This isn't what the government is planning to do.



"
Ayarlaand keessatti maaltu yerodhaaf hayyamamaadha?,"The correct answer is **C: Haleellaa raawwachuu (Implementing the law)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the Parliament of Ireland is enacting a law to ""improve the health and well-being of the population.""
* The Minister of Health is emphasizing the importance of ""implementing the law"" and working with community health workers (qoricha sammuu adoochu) to achieve this. 
* Therefore, the core action required is to put the law into practice, which translates to ""implementing the law"" or ""haleellaa raawwachuu"" in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabsanii seenun hatuu (Leaving it alone)** - This is the opposite of what the text describes.
* **B: Waliin dhahuu (Going away)** - This is irrelevant to the context of implementing a law.
* **D: Qoricha sammuu adoochu (Community Health Workers)** - While community health workers are involved in *implementing* the law, they are not the action *itself*.
"
Namni yakkaan shakkame maal irratti qorannoon irratti gaggeeffamaa jira?,"The correct answer is **B: Miidhaa qaamaa (Physical harm)**.

The passage states that Kiristoofer Garshiyaa was arrested for a **physical altercation** (""sababa gidduu seeneef dha sanyiin himaatamuu caalaa"").  It explicitly says his physical appearance wasn't harmed and focuses on the peaceful gestures he made. The core of the arrest was the physical conflict.
"
"Yeroo mallatttoo jijjiiru (altering the sign), shakkamaan maal gochuu hin qabu ture?","The correct answer is **A: Qubeewwan isaa keessaa tokko jijjiiruu (Altering one of his letters)**.

The text explicitly states that Kiristoofer Garshiyaa altered his sign by using a circle and an ""e"" instead of a ""O"" to represent peace and love. This directly aligns with option A. The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa barsiisan Ingiliffaa Koornon kan hin himatamneef kami?","The correct answer is **D: Daree keessatti jechoota safuu cabsan dubbachuu** (Speaking only words of polite formality).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Barataan duraanii akka jedhetti inni ‘daree keessatti afaan garee murtaa’e qofaan dubbatamu fayyadame, akkasumas akkuma hiriyaa barattootaa ture.”  This translates to: ""As the previous student said, he only used polite formal language, and was like a mentor to the students."" 

The question asks what Koornon *didn't* teach, according to the text.  The text indicates he *did* use polite formal language (""daree keessatti jechoota safuu cabsan dubbachuu""). Therefore, he didn't teach speaking only polite formal language. The other options are not mentioned as things he didn't do.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Rolaandoo Mendoozadhaan kan uggurmane eenyu ture?","The correct answer is **A: Tursitoota (Tourists)**.

The text states: ""Rolando Mendozaan M16 kan ta’ee qawwee isaa gara Tuuristiiti dhukaase."" This translates to: ""Rolando Mendoza arrested his own security detail, who are tourists."" Therefore, he arrested the tourists.
"
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, namoota ugguraman keessaa kanneen dursaniii bahuunsaanii kan hin mirkanoofne kami?","The correct answer is **A: Turistoota (Tourists)**.

The passage states: ""Butamtoonni baayyeen baraaramaniiru akkasumaan immoo xiqqeenyaan amma yoonaa namni jaha du’uun mirkanaayeera."" This translates to ""Many tourists were unharmed, but a small number were injured, with one dying.""

This directly indicates that the tourists are the ones who were injured and did not feel satisfied with the outcome. The other options are not mentioned as being negatively affected in the passage.
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Biraazil keessatti gaa’illi saala wal-fakkaata seera qabeessa akka ta’u deeggaruuf eenyutu mallattoo walitti qabaa jira?","The correct answer is **A: Mormitoota (Citizens)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that citizens of Brazil have been advocating for separation of church and state for 100 years and have been working towards it. The passage also mentions the 1.2 million people who signed a petition to the Brazilian Congress, highlighting the role of citizens in this movement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Robeertoo Jefersan (Robert Jefferson):** While mentioned as someone who currently holds the torch, he is not the primary agent driving the separation movement.
*   **C: Waldaa Rooman Kaatolikii (Roman Catholic Church):** The passage indicates the opposite - the Church has historically had a strong influence and relationship with the Brazilian state.
*   **D: Maartaa Saplisii (Marta Saplisii):** She is mentioned as the one who initially conceived the law, but the movement's current strength lies with the citizens who have continued the effort over the years.



Therefore, the citizens are the most accurate answer as they are actively working to achieve separation of church and state."
Mormitoonni iyyata isaanii eenyutti kennu?,"The correct answer is **A: Waldaa Rooman Kaatolikii**.

The text states: ""Sanadni jalqabaa kantiibaa Siyoo Pooloo duraanii, Maartaa Sappiliisiin qophaa’e. Seerri dhihaate, erga fooyya’een booda, amma harka Roobertoo Jaafersan jira. Sadaasa keessa mormitoonni sagalee miiliyoona 1.2 sassaabanii Koongeresii Biyyaalessaf dhiheessuuf abdii qabu.""

This means the citizens submitted their petitions *to the Roman Catholic Church* (Waldaa Rooman Kaatolikii). The other options are incorrect:

*   **Robeertoo Jefersan** is mentioned as the current head of the petition, not where the petitions are submitted.
*   **Mana Maree Biyyaalessaa Biraazil** is the Brazilian Congress.
*   **Kantiibaa Saa’o Pooloo** is the author of the petition, not where it's submitted.



"
"Akkaataa ragaa Armand Versaasitti, osoo namoonni walitti qabaman haala qilleensatti miira isaanii hin agarsiisin dura kallattiidhan maaltu mudate?","The correct answer is **A: Cabbii buusuu eegale (The rain started)**.

The passage states: ""Sana booda cabbiin samii irraa bu’ee..."" which translates to ""After that, the rain started..."" This indicates that the rain started after the initial period of high speed, causing the changes described.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agarsiisichi daqiiqaa shan boodatti hafee gaggeeffamaa ture (The show lasted for four minutes after that):** The passage doesn't mention a show or its duration.
* **C: Bubbee cimaatu ture (It was a cloudy day):** While the rain might be associated with a cloudy day, the passage specifically mentions the *start* of the rain as the turning point.
* **D: Bakka miseensi maatii jiran dhabe (They lost the location of the family gathering):** The passage mentions people being lost and using wheelchairs, but doesn't explicitly state they lost the location of a family gathering. The focus is on the weather and the impact of the rain.



"
"Akka versaasitti, bubbee cimaan yoom eegale?","The correct answer is **B: Rooba booda**

The text states: ""Sana booda roobni dhufe, garuu baayee cimaa fi baayee guddaa kan gogaa kee raasu..."" which translates to ""After that, the dust rose, but it was very thick and filled my eyes..."" 

Therefore, the dust rose *after* the rain stopped.
"
"Fireed dura, bubbeewwan ciccimaa meeqatu baha 35°W tti galmaa’e?","The correct answer is **D: Tokko (One)**.

The passage states: ""Heerikeen qofaatu gara bahaatti 35°W galmeesse"" which translates to ""Only Heerikeen reached 35°W"".  Therefore, only one bubbeen (likely referring to a satellite or similar object) reached that location before Fred.
"
"Yeroo Fireed dhiyeenya oddoola Keep Vardeetti argame, kallattii kamitti deemaa ture?","The correct answer is **B: Kibb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fred obomboleettii tirooppikaalaa cimaa durarraa gara kibbaatti galmaa’eedha..."" which translates to ""Fred the tropical obomboleettii was heading south...""

Therefore, when Fred was observed at 645 (km 1040) from Keepi Verdetti, he was heading **South (kibb)**.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kan isa duraa caalaa saffisa caalu kan qabu kami?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Saffisawwan 802.11n kan isaan dura turan, kanneen saffisi isaanii ol-aanaan sekoondiitti meeggaabiitii 600 ta’e caalaa saffisa guddaa qabu.""  This translates to: ""The 802.11n standards that came before have a much greater speed than the previous ones, exceeding 600 megabits per second.""
"
802.11b wajjin duubatti deebi’ee kan wal-faana deemu ta’uuf 802.11n dhaaf maaltu murteessadha?,"The correct answer is **A: Saffisa cimaa (Higher speed)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that 802.11n has significantly higher speed than its predecessors.** It mentions speeds exceeding 600 Mbps.
* **The question asks why 802.11n is a significant improvement over 802.11b.** The main reason for the improvement is the much faster data transfer rate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 802.11b dandeettii 5.0Ghz irratti hojjachuuf qabu (Ability to operate on 5.0Ghz):** The passage says 802.11a and 802.11g operate on 5.0Ghz, but it *doesn't* say 802.11b does.  The passage highlights that 802.11n is a step up from 802.11a, b, and g *all* of which use two radio bands.
* **C: 600Mbit/s tti hanga odeeffannoo (Up to 600Mbit/s data rate):** This is a *result* of the higher speed, not the *reason* 802.11n is better than 802.11b.
* **D: Duwaal raadiyoo (Dual radio):** The passage states that 802.11a, b, g, and n all use two radio bands. Therefore, 802.11n having a dual radio isn't a factor in why it is an improvement over 802.11b.



"
Dorgommiiwwan Komonweelz irratti namni dorgommii Olompikii irratti warqee mo’ate sagantaalee (events) meeqa bishaan daakuu qaba ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Shan (Five)**.

The text states that Mo'atan medaaliya warqee Olompikii akkataa bilisaan bishaan meetira 100 fi 200 daakuuf dorgomuuf ture. This means she competed in the 100m and 200m races, totaling **five** events (100m + 200m + other events she participated in).
"
Namni dorgommii Olompikii irratti warqee mo’ate sun maalif dhukkubbii itti dhagahamuuf qoricha hin fudhanne?,"The correct answer is **C: Dandeettii qaama (fitness) isaarratti dhiibbaa negatiiva ta’e qabaata jedhee yaadda’ee ture.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sababaa komii isaatiif ga’umsi qaamaa isaa shakkii keessa galee jira."" This translates to ""Because of the competition, the results of her physical condition came into question."" 

It further says: ""Taphoota irraa waan dhorkamaniif dhukkubbii isaa to’achuuf qoricha barbaachisu fudhachuu hin dandeenye."" This translates to ""Due to the results of the tests, she could not obtain the medicine needed to alleviate her pain.""

Therefore, the issue wasn't simply having a pain (A or B). The problem stemmed from a perceived negative impact on her physical fitness/condition (C), which led to the inability to receive medication. Option D is irrelevant to the passage.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, waa’ee kirikira lafaa maaltu burjaajif nama saaxilee ture?","The correct answer is **A: Duumessi gurraachi mul’achuu (Volcanic ash cloud)**.

The text states: ""Duumessa dukkana kan voolkaanoo waliin walitti hidhata hin qabne akka waan bu’uraa gaaraatti gabaafame."" which translates to ""The volcanic ash cloud was blown away harmlessly.""  This directly links the volcanic ash cloud (duumessa dukkana kan voolkaanoo) to the disruption caused by the eruption.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gabaasa Biiroo Meetiroolojii Ayislaandik irraa (From the Icelandic Meteorological Office):** The Meteorological Office *reported* the eruption, but the *ash cloud* is what caused the problem.
* **C: Maappii kirkira lafaa idila-addunyaa (Global earthquake maps):** The text is about a *volcanic eruption*, not an earthquake.
* **D: Taatewwan naannolee Ayisland birraa irraa gabaafaman (Reports from other Icelandic regions):** While reports *might* have been gathered, the text specifically highlights the *ash cloud* as the source of the disruption.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, jijjiirran sadarkaa yoom mudate?","The correct answer is **A: Bitootessa 10 dura**.

The text states: ""Sochiin inni guddaan kirkira lafaa kan sadarkaa jijjiiruu taasise Bitooteessa 10 kaaba bahaa bantii volkaanoo kaalderaa irratti ta’e."" This translates to ""The main earthquake that caused the volcanic eruption occurred at 10 o'clock."" 

Therefore, the earthquake occurred at 10 o'clock, which is the same as ""Bitootessa 10 dura"" (10 hours ago).
"
Waa’ee konkolaataa hawaa Chandrayaan-1’s ilaalchisee himoota armaan gadii keessaa kamtu dhugaa miti?,"The correct answer is **A: Orbitarri konklaataa hawaa (probe) nama of keessaa qaba ture.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Orbitarri qorannoo Dhiibbaa Ji’aa (MIP) isaa buqqisee...kan naana’uu...manquraakuriin ji’a qorattu sun fakkii alaabaa biyyaalessaa Indiyaa, kan kallattiiwwan hundaan itti dibame illee ofirraa qabdi.""  This means the orbiter was *not* manned (did not have people on board).

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Konkolaatichi meeshaa murteessaa ta’uu ittuma fufe:** The passage mentions ""Meeshaalee saayinsaawaa barbaachisoo sadii baachuun alatti..."" (besides launching three important scientific instruments...). This confirms it carried scientific instruments.
*   **C: Konkolaatichi yeroo furguggifamu milkaa’aa ture:** The passage states it ""milkaa’inaan naannoo Ji’a poolii kibba buufatee."" (successfully reached the South Pole region of the Moon). This proves it functioned successfully upon arrival.
*   **D: Konkolaatichi gam lamaanuu halluu dibamaa qaba:** While not explicitly stated, the fact that it achieved its mission goals (reaching the South Pole, conducting studies) suggests it functioned as intended.

Therefore, only option A contradicts the information provided in the text.



"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa konkolaataa hawaa (lunar probe) sirriitti kan ibsu kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Orbitarii nama baatu irraa furguggifame ykn adda bahe (was ejected from the orbiter or moved away)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the orbiter (MIP) separated from the lunar probe (Chandrayaan-1) and moved 1.5 kilometers per second (3000 mph) towards the south pole of the Moon. This separation implies a controlled ejection or maneuver where the orbiter intentionally moved away from the probe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bantii kaabaa Addeessatti dhihoo buufate (exhausted the thrusters at the lunar surface):** This describes a landing scenario, not the separation of an orbiter from a probe.
*   **B: Gara lafaatti deebisanii kuffisuun milkaa’aa ture (successfully returned to Earth and landed):** The orbiter was in lunar orbit, not returning to Earth.
*   **D: Meeshaalee murteessoo ta’an lama baatee ture (had deployed two scientific instruments):** While the orbiter *did* deploy instruments, this doesn't explain how it separated from the probe.

Therefore, the separation of the orbiter is best described by it being ejected or moved away from the lunar probe."
"Kuticha irratti hundaa’un, tarkaanfii dhibee ittisuuf taasifamu keessaa dhumarratti hojiirra kan oolu kami?","The correct answer is **A: Farra ilbiisotaa (Pig catchers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Weerarichi mootummaa Indiyaa tarkaanfiilee kanneen akka naannoolee garmalee hubamanitti wantoota boyyee qaban bobbaasuu, hagoobaroota bookee buusaakumaatama raabsuu fi farra ilbiisotaa biifuu akka fudhatuuf kakaase."" 

Translation: ""The attack encouraged the Indian government, informed by intelligence, to slaughter pigs, arrest illegal snare makers, and provide compensation to affected families.""

Therefore, the government's action to provide compensation was specifically *to affected families* (which is linked to the pig catchers/families who lost pigs). Options B, C, and D are related to the disease (Encephalitis) itself, not the government's compensation strategy.
"
Dhibichi akkamitti namatti daddarba?,"The correct answer is **C: Booyyeewwan (Mushrooms)**.

The text states: ""Weerarichi mootummaa Indiyaa tarkaanfiilee kanneen akka naannoolee garmalee hubamanitti wantoota boyyee qaban bobbaasuu..."" which translates to ""The attack urged the Indian government, informed of these findings by intelligence agencies, to burn mushrooms...""

Therefore, the mushrooms are what are causing the illness.
"
Himni lammaffaa yoo hin milkoofne maal geessisa?,"The correct answer is **A: HJR-3 hatattamaan xiinxaluu** (HJR-3 to be scrutinized).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kufaatiin hima lamaffaa, kan saalli wal fakkaatan akka hin tokkoomnee yaada dhorku dhiyeessu, gara fuulduraatti tokkummaa saala walfakkiitiif balbala banuufi danda’a. Adeemsa sana hordofuudhaan, HJR-3n adeemsa keessa turuudhaaf bara 2015 yookaan 2016 keessa qaama seera baasu, isa itti aansee filatamuun irra deebi’amee ilaalama.""

Translation: ""The second issue, which presents contradictory information, can hinder the achievement of unity based on shared values. To implement that process, HJR-3 will be involved in the legislative process, and a body will be appointed between 2015 and 2016 to scrutinize it and return it to the original decision.""

This indicates that if the second issue (the contradictory information) isn't addressed, HJR-3 will be scrutinized (xiinxaluu) as part of the process to achieve unity and correct the initial decision.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mirga yuuniyeenii sivilii jaalattoota saala wal-fakkaataa gara fuulduraa** (Civil society organizations of the most prominent shared values). While civil society plays a role, the text doesn't specifically say they will be the result of the issue not being addressed.
*   **C: Walgahii hatattamaa seeraa tumtuu** (Legislative body to be established). The text mentions HJR-3's involvement in the legislative process, not the establishment of a new legislative body.
*   **D: Yuuniyeenii jaalattoota saala wal-fakkaataa dhorkame** (Union of civil society organizations of shared values). Similar to option B, the text does not state that a union will form as a consequence.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, himni lammaffaan yoom haqame?","The correct answer is **C: Gaafa Wiixataa (During the election)**.

The text states: ""Turtii seera hiiktotaa kanaaf jijiramnii kan umamee himni lamaffaan yeroo jalqabaa mana-maree baka bu’oota ummataatiin haqamuu itti aansee Wiixata gara mana mareetti haala walfakaatuun darbe."" This translates to ""To resolve this electoral dispute, the second appeal was filed during the election, seeking to have the election result upheld by the election board.""  Therefore, the second appeal was filed *during the election*.
"
“Panaamaa Peepars” eenyuutti dhoksaan kenname?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhaabbata Moosak Fonseka**.

The text explicitly states: ""Waraqaan Panama"" akka dibabeeti ilalama faayilaa miiliyoonaa kudhan kan dhaabbata seeraa Mosaak Fonsekaaa warreen Panama irraa argamaniif... (The Panama Papers, which were leaked, are files of millions belonging to the law firm Mossack Fonseca...).
"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, Pireesin Biriitish dhaabbilee qabeenya heddu dhuunfatan hoogganaa ture jechuun eenyu himatan?","The correct answer is **A: Maamiloota dureeyyii baankilee hedduu (The Panama Papers)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Waraqaan Panama...warreen Panama irraa argamaniif...bankotni kudha afur maamilootni sooressootni taaksii fi damboota kan biroo akka baqataniif, qabeenya doolaara US biiliyoonotaan lakkaa’aman akka dhoksan gargaaruusaaniiti."" This directly translates to ""The Panama Papers...from information obtained from Panama Papers...four dozen banks, insurance companies, taxi companies and others were shown to be helping clients hide assets worth billions of US dollars.""

The Panama Papers are the source of the information that many individuals, including presidents, were linked to hiding assets. The text doesn't mention the British President or any other entity directly. It highlights the banks and companies involved.
"
Balaawwan xayyaaraa armaan gadii keessaa kan namoonni heddu itti du’an kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Xayyaara osoo Iraan irraa gara Armiiniyaa imaluu kufee caccabe**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Jalqaba turban kanaa, caccabuun heelikooptara poolisii namoota sadi ajjeese akkasumas sadii ol madeesse. **Iraan balaa qilleensa irraa baddu-ba’aa argite waggoota keessatti yeroo xiyyarri ishee gara Armeeniyaa deemaa ture kufee, namoota keessa turan 168 ajjeese.**""
* This directly translates to: ""At the beginning of this turban, a police helicopter attack killed three and injured four. **Iran experienced a significant disaster when its helicopter attacked Armenia, killing 168 people.**""

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:

* **B: Helikoptara poolisii caccabe** - While the helicopter attacked, the question asks about *who* was most affected by helicopter attacks, not the helicopter itself.
* **C: Xayyaara osoo Armiiniyaa irraa gara Iraan imaluu kufee caccabe** - The text explicitly says the attack happened *from* Iran *to* Armenia.
* **D: Xayyaara Mashhaaditti caccabe** - The text mentions a helicopter flying from Mashhad, but it doesn't state that the attack occurred *in* Mashhad. It states an attack happened *from* Mashhad.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa balaa xayyaaraa heddu Iraanitti mudatuuf sababa kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Xayyaarota haaraa bituuf hanqina bajataa (Lack of budget to maintain the hair police).**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Iranian police are using ""hair scanners"" (xiyyaarri haaraan) to suppress protests. The repeated accidents involving these scanners (killing and injuring protesters) suggest a lack of proper training, maintenance, or perhaps a rush to deploy the technology without adequate resources.  Therefore, the lack of budget to maintain them is a likely contributing factor to the accidents.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Xayyaarota siviliifi waraanaa durii (Civilian and military border guards):** The text focuses on internal protests and the police's actions, not border security.
*   **C: Qoqqobbii xayyaarota haaraa akka hin binne dhokru (Fear that the hair police will not be recognized):** This is not directly supported by the text. The problem seems to be with the *use* of the scanners, not their recognition.
*   **D: Xayyaarota sirnaan qabuu dhiisuu (Abandoning all systems):** The text doesn't suggest a complete abandonment of all systems, only problems with a specific new technology (the hair scanners).



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa gabaasa Garee Qorannoo Iraaq keessatti kan hin hammatamin hafe kami?,"The correct answer is **D: US akka hayyamamaa taatuf gaafachuu (Requesting US mediation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Gabaasichi poolisii giddu galeessa bahaatiif deebii wal falmii banaa fi hundeeffama walii galtee Yuunayiitid Isteets keessatti akka ta’uuf karaa bana."" This translates to ""The briefing requested mediation from the neutral party and involvement of the United States diplomatic community.""  Therefore, requesting US mediation is a key element of the briefing that is highlighted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seera pirezidaantii qeequu (Presidential decree law):** While presidential decrees are relevant to Iraqi affairs, the briefing doesn't mention it as a key element.
*   **B: Labsii jijjiirama muraasa qabuun, rakkinni Iraaq keessatti guddataa dhufe hambisuun ni danda’ama (A limited transitional plan can alleviate the problems in Iraq):**  The briefing mentions a transitional plan *regarding* the Iraqi government, but it doesn't say the briefing itself presented a limited plan.
*   **C: Daangaa Iraaq eeguf yaadota furmaataa (Iraqi government has solutions):** While the briefing involves the Iraqi government, the main point isn't about the government having solutions; it's about seeking external mediation.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa gabaasa Garee Qorannoo Iraaq keessatti akka ta’u kan hin gaafatamne kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Inisheetivii dippilomaasii haaraa hundeessuu (Initiative diippilomaasii haaraa hundeessuu)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Iraqi Inquiry Committee's report *didn't* recommend:

*   **A: Rakkina dabalaa jiru keessatti wabii kennuu labsuu (Giving a reward for the excessive crime):** The report is described as very cautious and focused on the current Iraqi religious establishment.
*   **B: Qajeelfama irratti hatattamaan jijjiirama gochuu (Making changes as specified in the legislation):** The report focuses on the *way* information is disseminated, not on changing laws.
*   **C: Falmii banaa ta’e fayyadamuu (Using a mediation agreement):** The report highlights the breakdown of mediation efforts.

However, the passage *does* mention that the committee's report calls for **initiating a new diplomatic initiative** involving dialogue with Iraqi actors and cooperation with major countries. This is the recommendation that is *not* mentioned as being part of the committee's findings.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer."
"Akkaataa poolisiitti, nama harka mirgaa Pirovenzaanoo jedhamee kan ilaalamu eenyu ture?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Pikooloo**.

The text states: ""Akka poolisiin jedhetti Loo Pikkooloon harka ol aanaa qaba sababnisaas inni Paalermotti harka mirgaa Piroovenzaanoos ture..."" which translates to ""The police saw Lo Piccolo as the head of the organization because he was the head of the organization in Palermo of the Provenzano's organization...""
"
"Odeeffannoo kuticha keessatti kenname irratti hundaa’un, sababni du’a Faalkon maal ture?","The correct answer is **D: Namuma akkasaa kiruseedarii Maafiyaa ta’e Pawoloo Borseliinodhaan ajjeefame.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeroo inni lola Riinaan walqabateen biyya lubbuuwwan loltoota amantaa Maafiyaa Ji’oovaannii Faalkoonii fi Pa’oolo Boorseliinoo bara 1992 keessa galaafatte lola xumurarraan ga’e ajajoonni kunniin Piroovenzaanoodhaan ittifaman.""

This translates to: ""When he allied with the Riina clan and entered the territory of the religious leaders of the Mafia, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borselino, the operation ended with the assassinations carried out by the Pirovenzano clan.""

Therefore, Falcone and Borselino were assassinated by the Pirovenzano clan. The passage also mentions they were religious leaders (Jehovah's Witnesses) within the Mafia.  Borselino is specifically identified as being involved in the assassination.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa badhaasa Hitooshii Saa’itoo kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Olompikii irratti si’a lama warqee argate (Won two Olympic medals)**.

The text explicitly states: ""lammiin Jaappaanii juudoo hojjetu, inni meedaaliyaa warqee Oolompiikii lama mo’ate"" which translates to ""a Japanese judo practitioner who won two Olympic medals"".

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shaampiyoonaa Addunyaa si’a lama (Won the World Championship twice):** The text says he was a World Champion *before* the Olympics, but not that he won it twice.
* **B: Gaggeessaa Koree Federeeshinii Juudoo Jaappan Hunda (President of the Japan Judo Federation):** The text mentions he was a former *vice-president* of the Japan Judo Federation, not the president.
* **D: Beekaa juudoo (Famous judo practitioner):** While true, it's not the most specific or defining characteristic mentioned in the text. The text highlights his Olympic medals.



"
Iwaasaakin eessatti waadaa ykn kakuu seene?,"The correct answer is **C: Indiyaa**.

The text states: ""cidha dhisuun gara Neeppaalitti badee sana booda **Indiiyatti qabamee**."" This translates to ""after that, he went to Nepal and then **was found in India**.""
"
Eenyutu Iwaasaakii rukute?,"The correct answer is **A: Haadha warraa isaa (His mother)**.

The passage states: ""Imala isaa keessatti, Iwaasaakiin yeroo hedduu balaarra bu’ee ture. Inni hattoota bishaan irraadhaan hatame, kan miidhamees saree nama ciinintun, cidha dhisuun gara Neeppaalitti badee sana booda Indiiyatti qabamee.""

This translates to: ""In his youth, Iwaasaaki had many misfortunes. He was banished from his tribe, and when he was found, he killed a person, and fleeing with stolen goods, he went to Nepal and then to India.""

The first part mentions ""Imala isaa keessatti"" which means ""In his youth/during his upbringing"" which implies his mother was present during those early events.  While the passage mentions other things, his mother is the most logical answer given the context of his upbringing and misfortunes. The passage doesn't explicitly state *who* banished him, but the context points towards his mother as having some role (though not necessarily directly causing the banishment).
"
Alloonson yoom dorgommii isaa raawwate?,"The correct answer is **C: Shumaachar dorgommii isaa erga xumureen booda** (After Schumacher finished his race).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Michael Schumacher dorgommii isaa kan dhaabe yeroo Alonson dhaabe irraa fagoo hin turre, sababiin isaas yeroo garaagaraatti miidhaa buusaa qaama isaa irra waan ga’eefiidha.""  This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher, even after his race ended, did not let Alonso get ahead, and therefore he suffered a crash in the final laps.""

Therefore, Alonso's race outcome is directly related to Schumacher's actions *after* Schumacher had already finished.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shumaachar gommaa isaa fuulduraa erga jalaa miidhee booda** (After Schumacher took off his helmet):  While Schumacher's crash happened after taking off his helmet, the key point is that the crash happened *after* his race was essentially over, and he was trying to prevent Alonso from passing him.
* **B: Fischellaan konkolaataa isaa to’achuu dadhabe** (Schellaan couldn't finish his race): This is true, but the question specifically asks about *Alonso's* race outcome.
* **D: Osoo dursuu hin eegalin dura** (Before not overtaking): This is not a logical connection to Alonso's race outcome. The text implies Alonso was trying to overtake Schumacher *after* Schumacher had finished his race and was slowing down.



"
Shumaachar dafee dorgommii akka addaan kutu maaltu taasise?,"The correct answer is **C: Miidhaa gommaa Fiischellan irraan gahe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher dorgommii isaa kan dhaabe yeroo Alonson dhaabe irraa fagoo hin turre, sababiin isaas yeroo garaagaraatti miidhaa buusaa qaama isaa irraan ga’eefiidha."" This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher, even though Alonso was ahead, did not let him go, and because of this, he was hit by the suspension bump at a critical moment.""

While option A mentions a problem with Fisichella's chocolate, that's not the reason Schumacher retired. Option B is irrelevant. Option D is not mentioned in the text. The text explicitly states that Schumacher was hit by a suspension bump.



"
"Akkaataa kutichaatti, namoota hidhamaniif wabii qindeessun hojii eenyuti?","The correct answer is **D: Komishinara mana murtii** (Commissioner of the Prison).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Koomishinerichi yoo mirga wabii kan qabu ta’e kan mijessuufiif fi himatawwan qondaala to’annoo jala oolcheen guutaman, sirna kan qabsiisudha."" This translates to: ""If the commissioner has the authority, they will release those who have been unjustly detained, and the complaints will be handled.""

Therefore, the commissioner is the authority figure responsible for addressing the complaints and potentially releasing the detained individuals.
"
"Akkaataa ajaja nama tokko yeroof to’annoo jala tursiisuu kuticha keessatti eerameetti, namoonni hidhaman sa’aatii 24 ol to’annoo seeraa jala turuuf maal akka qabaatantu hayyamamaaf?","The correct answer is **C: Himannaa idilee abbaa murtii Giliyaanin irratti dhiyaatu (The internal report from Abba Murti Gilaayini)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Waggaa kana Eblatti, uuguurri yeroofi Abbaa Seeraa Gilaayiniin kennamee waa’ee warreen sa’aatii 24 f qabamanii turaaniin booda fudhaatamuun gara koomishinaariitti geeffamuun osoo waan jedhamee hin fudhatiin.

Translation: ""This year in Eblat, the time conflict and Abba Murti Gilaayini's report, regarding the people detained for 24 hours, was submitted to the commissioner without being accepted as stated. If the commissioner has the authority to investigate and the internal report with comprehensive allegations of torture, the system will be addressed. These reports are then filed in the computer system of the local government's authority.""

This clearly indicates that the internal report from Abba Murti Gilaayini was the mechanism used to address the issue of people being detained for longer than 24 hours. The report was used to initiate an investigation and address allegations of torture.



Therefore, option C is the accurate answer."
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, sababni kamtu filannoo haqame ibsuuf itti hin fayyadamne?","The correct answer is **B: Heera mootummaa faallessuu (Undermining the rule of law)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Afghan leaders are hesitant to choose a specific option because they don't want to undermine the rule of law in Afghanistan. The diplomats are concerned that a particular choice would negatively impact the legal framework of the country. Therefore, the concern revolves around the potential weakening or erosion of the rule of law.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Balaa nageenyaa (Security disaster):** While a security disaster is a concern, the passage focuses specifically on the legal implications of the choice.
*   **C: Baasii olaanaa (Extraordinary exit):** The passage doesn't explicitly mention the possibility of an ""extraordinary exit.""
*   **D: Heerri mootummaa hiika garaa garaa qabaachuu (The government's law having broad interpretations):** While the passage touches upon law, it’s not the primary concern. The core fear is not about the flexibility of interpretation, but about the impact on the legal system itself.



"
Filannoon maaliif dippilomaatota biratti akka hin barbaachifnetti ilaalame?,"The correct answer is **C: Heera mootummaa irratti shakkiin hiikaa nii jira ture (There was doubt in the legitimacy of the government's law)**.

Here's why:

The text states that leaders hesitated to support a decision regarding the future of Afghanistan due to concerns about the legitimacy of the Afghan government's laws. They didn't want to undermine the diplomatic efforts to ensure the laws were functioning properly. This directly points to a lack of confidence in the government's legal authority.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Heera mootummaa kan mormu ta’ee argame (The government's law was found to be flawed):** While the law *might* be flawed, the text focuses on the *doubt* in its legitimacy, not necessarily its flaws.
*   **B: Balaan nageenyaa nii jira ture (There was no security force):** The text doesn't mention a lack of security forces as a reason for hesitation.
*   **D: Filannoon baay’ee qaalii ture (The decision was very expensive):** Cost is not mentioned as a factor in the leaders' hesitation.



"
Tajaajila seeraa warra FATA f eenyu dhiyeessa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mootummaa Paakistaani (Pakistani Government)**.

The passage states that the ""Bakka-buutota Siyaasaa"" (Political Offices) in FATA were established to ""tajaajila mootummaa fi seera kabachiisu dhiheessuf"" (provide service to the government and enforce the law). This directly indicates that the Pakistani government is the entity the political offices serve.
"
Himoota armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee “Ejensoota Siyaasaa” FATA dhugaa kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Heera mootummaa Paakistaanitti kan qabamani dha (Belongs to the laws of the Pakistani government).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the ""Bakka-buutota Siyaasaa"" (Political Councils) in FATA were established to ""tajaajila mootummaa fi seera kabachiisu dhiheessuf dirqamaa qabu keeyyate 247 heera Pakistaan jalati"" which translates to ""have the power to implement government and administer laws of Pakistan, with 247 laws of Pakistan at their disposal.""  Therefore, they are directly connected to and operate within the framework of Pakistani law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tajaajila seeraa ni dhiyeessu (Implement laws):** This is *true* according to the passage, but it doesn't distinguish the incorrect option.
* **B: Pirezidantii Paakistaanidhaan filataman (Chosen by the President of Pakistan):** The passage doesn't state that they are chosen by the President. The passage indicates their power comes from existing Pakistani law.
* **D: Naannolee murtaa’oo irratti to’annoo guutuu qabu (Have comprehensive authority over tribal areas):** While they have authority, the passage emphasizes that this authority is *based on* and *constrained by* Pakistani law.  Option C is a more precise and direct statement from the text.



"
Ema Istoni badhaasa kamiif kaadhimamte?,"The correct answer is **C: Taatuu Cimtuu**.

The text explicitly states: ""Gooslingi fi istoon niin kadhima, tummaa Taatoo Cimaa fi Taatuu Cimtuu walduraadubaan fudhatan."" which translates to ""Gosling and the story were supported by Father Cima and Father Cimtuu.""  Since ""Cimtuu"" is listed as the second father mentioned, it's most likely referring to **Taatuu Cimtuu** (Father Cimtuu).
"
Fiilmichi badhaasa isa kamiif hin kaadhimamne?,"The correct answer is **A: Suuraa Baay’ee gaarii (Extraordinary Scenes)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sirboonni lama fiilmii Oodiishin irraa (Zee Fuulsi Huu Diriim) fi Siitii oof Istaarsi, kaadhimamtummaa sirba baay’ee oorijinaala argateera."" This translates to: ""Two film clips from auditions (The Fullsi Who Dream) and Sites of Stars revealed a lot of original footage.""  The preceding sentence mentions numerous categories where the film received recognition, *except* for ""Suuraa Filatamoo"" (Extraordinary Scenes). Therefore, it was not recognized for extraordinary scenes.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kirkirri lafaa erga tahee booda kamtu hojii itti fufe?,"The correct answer is **A: Riiyaaktaroota warshaa Hokurikuu Shika keessatti argaman hunda (All reactors at the Hokuriku Power Plant)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""warshaan niiwukileerii walnyaachisu lakkoofsa 1fi2 Shiikaa keessa jiran garuu cufamanii turani."" This translates to ""The two reactors at the Hokuriku nuclear power plant were shut down."" It then goes on to say that 9400 people were evacuated and 100,000 homes lost power.  The text also mentions the Noto wind farm in Ishikawa Prefecture was also shut down. While other things were affected, the reactors at the Hokuriku plant were the primary nuclear-related facilities impacted and shut down.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Buufaxa xiyyaaraa Ishikawa (Noto wind farm in Ishikawa):** While the wind farm was shut down, the question asks what *continued* after the initial earthquake. The text doesn't state the wind farm resumed operations.
* **C: Tajaajila daandii baaburaa hunda (All railway services):** The text mentions railway services were affected, but it doesn't say they continued to operate after the initial earthquake.
* **D: Buufata madda Ibsaa Nigata (Niigata Chuetsu Coal Power Station):** The text doesn't mention this facility at all.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa sababa kirkira lafaatiin miidhaan kan irra gahe isaan kami?","The correct answer is **B: Riiyaaktaroota warshaa Shika lama (Two reactors at the Shikama plant)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""warshaan niiwukileerii walnyaachisu lakkoofsa 1fi2 Shiikaa keessa jiran garuu cufamanii turani"" which translates to ""the two reactors at the Shikama nuclear plant were the ones that were damaged.""

While the other options are mentioned as consequences or related issues, the primary cause of the radiation release is identified as the damage to the reactors themselves.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, dhimmoota armaan gadii keessaa kamtu sanada keessatti hin hammatamne?","The correct answer is **A: Iyerusaalem fuula duraa (East Jerusalem)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the conflict centered around the status of Jerusalem, specifically the eastern part, which is considered holy by both Jews and Muslims.  The passage also mentions the West Bank and Gaza Strip were under Israeli control after the 1967 war, and the Palestinian Authority (PA) was intended to take control of the West Bank after just four years.  The passage explicitly highlights the unresolved status of Jerusalem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sababa waraana bara 1967 (The reason for the 1967 war):** The passage describes the consequences of the 1967 war *after* it happened. The war itself isn't the primary unresolved issue being discussed in this section.
*   **C: Sulula keessatti argamuu loltootaa (The presence of settlers in the Sulula):** While settler presence is a contributing factor to the conflict, the passage focuses on the broader issue of Jerusalem's status, not just the settlers.
*   **D: Wal dhabdee daangaa irratti (On the shared land):** While shared land is a factor, the passage specifically highlights the disagreement over *Jerusalem*, which is a key point of contention.

Therefore, **East Jerusalem** is the most accurate answer as it's the core issue unresolved at the time described in the passage."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa fedha Filisxeemin kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Haalota waraana duraa kanneen waa’ee daangaa irratti bu’ureffataman** (Pre-war land-related issues).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses pre-1967 land disputes:** The text explicitly states that the conflict over land in the West Bank and East Jerusalem existed *before* the Six-Day War of 1967.  It mentions the issue was ""maddureewwan biroon mari’ataman"" (disputes) that had been ongoing for decades.
* **The other options are too specific:**
    * **B: Itti fufiinsaan sulula Yoordaanosi keessatti argamuu loltootaa** (The presence of settlers in the Jordan Valley): While settlers are a part of the ongoing conflict, the passage doesn't focus *solely* on their presence in the Jordan Valley. It's a broader land issue.
    * **C: Deebilee waa’ee Yerusaalem fuula duraan wal qabatan** (The face-to-face negotiations on the issue of Jerusalem):  The passage mentions negotiations, but it's not the primary land issue being discussed – it's the *underlying dispute* itself.
    * **D: Waggaa shaniif sulula Yoordaanosi keessatti argamuu loltootaa** (The presence of settlers in the Jordan Valley for four years): The passage states the PA only gained a foothold in the Jordan Valley *after* the agreement, not that settlers have been there for four years as a defining issue.



Therefore, option A best captures the overarching point of the passage concerning the pre-war land-related problems.



"
Ma biyya kamitti barumsa Seeraa barate?,"The correct answer is **A: Yuunaayitid Isteet Ameerikaa**.

The text states: ""Ma’n kan baratte Yuuniversitii Niiwu Yoorkiti fi mana barumsa seera Harvarditi fi..."".  New York University and Harvard Law School are both located in the United States.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, biyya kamtu injifannoo filannoo Ma’f gargaarteetti jedhamee dubbatama?","The correct answer is **A: Yuunaayitid Isteet Ameerikaa (United States of America)**.

The passage explicitly states that Ma'n had a ""green card"" from the United States and that the US offered him a chance to leave his country due to difficult times.
"
"Akka kutaa kana keessatti ibsametti, Carolyn Wilson osoo magaalaa gadhiisee hin deemin eenyuuf hojjechaa ture?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""maatiin baayeen yerooma sana Carolyn Wilson inni OHA akka kuufamaa dhoksaa isaanii duraa hate biyyaa ba’e yaadatan."" This translates to: ""many times she thought about Carolyn Wilson from OHA, hoping she would come to their aid.""

Therefore, Carolyn Wilson worked for OHA.

"Bara dorgommii kanaaf dorgommiiwwan afur hafe keessatti, Shaampiyoonii Konkolaachiftootaatiin eenyutu sadarkaa afuraffaa irra jira?","The correct answer is **A: Hamilin**.

The text states: ""Hamliin qabxii digdama duubatti haftee jirti, garuu Baaworiin shaniin dursitee turte."" This means Hamliin has the highest score among the four players who finished in the top four.
"
Dorgommii kutaa keessatti ibsame hordofuun Kahne Shaampiyoonaa Konkolaachiftootaa irratti qabxii meeqa qaba?,"The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kahne fi Truex Jr. walduraaduubaan qabxii 2,220 fi 2,207 n shanaffaa fi jahaffaadha."" This means Kahne has 2,220 points.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, namoonni yeroo meeqa meeteorayitti kufanii boodarra madda Maarsii ta’uu isaanii mirkaneessanii jiru?","The correct answer is **A: Yeroo kudhan** (Time of six).

The text states: ""Adoolessa darbe dhagootni kudha shan kunneen amala dhiqama meeteorayitii waliin wal qabatan."" which translates to ""Last year, six dust particles were found to be of Martian origin."" Therefore, the answer is six (kudha shan).
"
"Akka kutaa kana keessatti eerametti, dhagaawwan ka’umsi isaanii maarsii ta’uun isaanii argame maal isaatu dhugaadha?","The correct answer is **A: Hundi isaanii gaafa roobaa meeteorayitii ji'a Adoolessa keessa argaman.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that 24,000 samples were analyzed, but *only* 34 were confirmed to be from Mars. 
* The key information is that these 34 were confirmed to be Martian because they were found to have a ""gaafa roobaa meeteorayitii"" (meteoritic crust). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isaan keessaa 24,000 ta'u (They are 24,000 of them):** This is true, but it doesn't explain *how* their Martian origin was confirmed.
* **C: $11,000 warqee caalaatti gatii baasu ($11,000 per sheet):**  This is the *value* of the samples, not the reason for their Martian origin.
* **D: Baay’inaan 34 isaaniitu jira (More than 34 of them exist):** This is incorrect; the passage explicitly states that *only* 34 were confirmed to be Martian.



"
Isichumaacher yoom sooruma bahe?,"The correct answer is **C: Erga Filiippee Maasaa bakka buusee booda** (After Felipe Massa moved to the position).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Shuumeeker kan erga tapha shaampiyoonummaa Foormulaa 1 bara 2006 mo’achuun booda, Filiippee Maasaa isai midhame bakka bu’uuf jedha.""  This translates to: ""Schumacher, after achieving the Formula 1 championship title in 2006, was replaced by Felipe Massa.""  This directly indicates that Schumacher's departure and Massa's arrival are linked.  The text implies Schumacher's departure *followed* Massa's promotion to the position.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Erga Filiippee Maasaa kufee booda (After Felipe Massa retired):** The text doesn't mention Massa retiring.
*   **B: Dorgommii torbaffaa isaa erga mo’atee booda (After his last race):** The text doesn't state that it was his last race.
*   **D: Dhuma bara dorgommii 2009 (End of the 2009 season):**  While he was involved in the 2009 season, the text highlights the change *after* Massa took over.

"
Maasaan yoom miidhame?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeroo Giraand Piriksi (During the Grand Prix)**.

The text states: ""Biraazilichi balaa mataa guddaaf yeroo dorgoommii Giraand Piriksii Hangarii 2009 irratti saaxilame."" which translates to ""During the Brazilian Grand Prix, he suffered a major accident in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""

Therefore, the accident happened *during* the Grand Prix.

"Akkaataa kutaa kanaatti, qophiin kun AOL irratti dhiibbaa akkamii qabaata?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkoobsi fayyadamtoota AOL dabaluu danda’a** (AOL can increase its user base).

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL is gaining popularity due to its widespread use in the United States. It also mentions that AOL's user base is growing, even surpassing the number of users of Yahoo! and Microsoft's instant messaging services. Therefore, the implication is that AOL's popularity is increasing, meaning it can likely increase its user base.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: AOL dhaabbata dhuunfaan gabaa IM uume ta’a** (AOL created a revolutionary instant messaging service) - The passage doesn't state this. It only mentions its growing popularity.
*   **C: Lakkoobsi fayyadamtoota AOL fayyadamtoota Yahoo fi Microsoft dhaan akka dorgoman ta’a** (AOL users will compete with Yahoo and Microsoft users) - The passage doesn't explicitly state direct competition is happening; it mainly focuses on AOL's rising popularity.
*   **D: AOL kana booda Yuunayitid Isteeti keessatti akka hin fayyadamne ta’a** (AOL will no longer be used in the United States) - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. It highlights AOL's increasing relevance.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu qophiin haaraa akka goolabamu gochuu danda’a?,"The correct answer is **C: Bilisummaa AOLn yeroo mataa isaatti gabaa guddisuu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Amma yoonaatti, AOL saffisa mataa isaatiin gabaa IM ol guddisuufi gara fuulduraatti deemsisuu danda’eera, sababa baay’inaan fayyadamiinsa Yuunaayitid Isteetis keessatti qabuuf."" (However, it's worth noting that AOL was able to greatly increase the popularity of IM due to its widespread use in the United States.)

The other options are related, but not the *direct* reason for the rise of IM:

* **A: Guddina Intarneetaa bal’inaan Yuunayitid Isteetii keessatti mul’ate:**  Internet growth *facilitated* the use of IM, but it wasn't AOL's specific contribution.
* **B: Fayyadama gabaa IM:** While IM use increased, this is a *result* of AOL's popularity, not the cause of the initial rise.
* **D: Walta’iinsa Yahoo fi Microsoft:** The partnership between Yahoo and Microsoft is a later development and not the initial driver of IM's popularity.



Therefore, AOL's ability to popularize IM through its platform is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
Bakka poolisooti hin jirretti namoota meeqatu haleellaa kanaan ajjeeffame?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The question asks how many people *other than* the police were killed. The text states: ""kan miidhaman keessaa kudha saglan isaanii poliisootan turan"" which translates to ""of those injured, thirty percent were police.""  It also says ""akkasumas namoota digdamaa caalan biroo madeesee"" which means ""as well as other civilians were killed."" The text doesn't specify the exact number of civilians killed, but it does state 19 people were killed in total (""ganama dhuka’e poolisoota lama ajjeese, akkasumas namoota digdamaa caalan biroo madeesee."" = ""in the morning, two police were killed, as well as other civilians were killed""). Therefore, the number of civilians killed is 19.
"
Haleellaa kana keessatti namoota shakkaman eenyutu gabaase?,"The correct answer is **A: Poolisii (Police)**.

The text states: ""Waajjirri bulchaa akka jedhetti kan miidhaman keessaa kudha saglan isaanii poliisootan turan."" which translates to ""The administration office said that among those injured, thirty percent were police officers.""
"
"Akkaataa haala Filooriidaan kan mo’ate naannolee hundaa akka fudhatu, Mitt Romney maal badhaafame?","The correct answer is **B: Kaadhimamtoota Paartii Rippabilikaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Filooriidaan kaadhimamtoota shantama Roomniif badhaaste, kunis isa filannoo paartii ripublikaaniif dura bu’ummaan akka kaadhimamuuf dhiibudhaafi."" This translates to: ""In Florida, five electors voted for Romney, which is a blow to the Republican party's confidence before the election.""

The key phrase is ""kaadhimamtoota shantama Roomniif badhaaste"" (five electors voted for Romney).  These electors are part of the Republican party.  Therefore, Romney received votes *from Republican electors*.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, filannoo jalqabaa irratti Giingirich sagalee dhibbentaa meeqa argate?","The correct answer is **B: Dhibbentaa 32**.

The text states: ""Dubbi himaan Mana Maree Yuunayitid Isteetsii duraanii Niwuut Giingirich dhibbentaa 32n lammaffaa ta’aniiru."" which translates to ""The House Majority Leader at the time, Newt Gingrich, received 32 votes.""
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, eenyutu bu'aa koree irraa argame waliin fiiguu itti hin fufne?","The correct answer is **D: Rominii**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Erga qabxiin dhufee booda, Giingiriich Saantooramiin baay’ee jaje, garuu Roomnii isa bakka isaa bu’uudhaan beeksisoonni duula-na-filadhaa badaan Giriingiriich irratti Aayoowaatti qilleensarra oolaniif jecha jabaa qaba ture.""

This means that after the initial period, Gingrich was frequently criticized, and **Romney**, who was based in his own place, had many pollsters in Iowa giving Gingrich a lot of negative comments. Romney didn't benefit from the alliance and was instead a source of criticism.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Gingrich:** He *did* benefit from the alliance initially.
*   **Bachmann:** The text says he decided to withdraw.
*   **Perii (Paige):** The text states Perri believed returning to Texas would be beneficial.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, bu'aa koree hordofuun waa’ee kaadhimamaa biraa gara caalu kan dubbate eenyu?","The correct answer is **D: Perii**.

The passage states: ""Peeriin akkas jechuun yaadasaa ibse ”Teeksaasitti deebi’uun qaba bu’aa walgayii galgala kanaa madaaluuf..."" which translates to ""Perri stated that returning to Texas would be beneficial for the upcoming electoral competition...""

Therefore, Perri is the one who mentioned the potential benefit of returning to Texas.
"
Bara 2015 dura bakki agarsiisni kun qofti itti agarsiifame eessa ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Raadiyoo ToogiiNeet**.

The passage states: ""Guyyota duraa keessa, agarsiisichi raadiyoo yeroo dheeraan addatti intarneetiin darbu Raadiyoo ToogiiNeet irratti darbe..."" which translates to ""In the early days, the station broadcast extensively online on Radio ToogiiNeet..."" This indicates that Radio ToogiiNeet was the station's platform before 2015.
"
Buufatni kunis agarsiisni kun akkamiin akka dhiyeeffamu ibsa?,"The correct answer is **A: Amaaterii**.

The text states: ""Yeroo jalqabaa taatota sagalee amaaterii ta’an, kanneen Teeksaas Bahaa keessaa ba’an dhiyeesse."" This translates to ""Initially, they were amateur broadcasters, who came from Texas Bahia."" Therefore, the station was initially run by amateurs.
"
Deeviid Heedlii gartuu loltootaa kan deeggare meeshaa dhukaasa akkamii walitti qabuuni?,"The correct answer is **D: Meeshaalee Atomaatikaa (Automatic weapons)**.

The text explicitly states that David Headley, a key figure in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, ""dalagichi hidhattoota milishaa garee Paakistaanii Laaskihaar-e-Taayibaa 10niin akka raawwatuuf gargaaree ture,"" which translates to ""helped the 10 Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba militant soldiers to carry out the attack using **automatic weapons**.""

Therefore, David Headley facilitated the use of automatic weapons in the attack.
"
Gartuun loltootaa gara Mumbaayitti imaluuf geejjiba gosa kami fayyadaman?,"The correct answer is **A: Daandii baabura (Buses)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Boombilee fi meeshaalee awutomaatikii fudhatanii dhufanii alaamaa baayyee kanneen iddoo namni itti baayyatu karaa baaburaa Chaatraappaatii Shivaajii Terminas fi Hoteela Taaj Mahal dabalatan rukutan.""  This translates to ""They arrived by accepting bombs and automatic weapons, marking many places frequented by people, including the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station and the Taj Mahal Hotel.""  The phrase ""karaa baaburaa"" refers to buses.
"
Ibsi bu’aa tapha Naadaal fi Ra’oonikiin Biriisbeeen kutaa kana keessatti caqafame sirritti argisiisu isa kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Ra’oonikiin qabxii walii galaa % 88 argate**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""servii jalqabaa tuqaa 76 ittiin tapha mo’e keessatti tuqaa saaphanaa 88% galche."" This directly translates to ""started serving with 76 points and achieved a serve percentage of 88%.""
* This means Ra'oonikiin (Raoonikiin) had an 88% first serve success rate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ra’oonikiin ijifate (Ra'oonikiin won)**: The text indicates Nadal won the match 7-2, so Ra'oonikiin lost.
* **C: Naadaal Ra’oonikiin injifate (Naadaal Ra'oonikiin injifate)**: The text says Nadal won, so he defeated Ra'oonikiin, not the other way around.
* **D: Ra’oonikiin qabxii 76 argate (Ra'oonikiin qabxii 76 argate)**:  76 is the number of points Nadal started with serving, not a total number of points Ra'oonikiin achieved. It is not directly related to Ra'oonikiin's performance overall.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, tapha jalqabaa booda ejjennoon Naadaalii fi Ra’oonikiin maal ture?","The correct answer is **A: Ra’oonikiin qabxii walii galaa % 88 argate**.

The text states: ""Servii jalqabaa tuqaa 76 ittiin tapha mo’e keessatti tuqaa saaphanaa 88% galche."" This means Nadal won the first set 7-6, and his first serve percentage was 88%. The question asks about Nadal and Raonic's performance *after* the first set. The text then immediately mentions Raonic's first serve percentage: ""Ra’oonikiin qabxii walii galaa % 88 argate"" (Raonic achieved a first serve percentage of 88%).  Therefore, option A is the most accurate statement based on the provided text about what happened after the first set.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Naadaal qabxii 76 injifate** - While true, this refers to Nadal winning the first set 7-6, not what happened *after* the first set.
*   **C: Qabxiin 7-2 ture** - This describes the score of the match, not what happened after the first set.
*   **D: Ra’oonikiin Naadaaliin ijifate** - The text says Nadal won the match 7-6, so Raonic did not win."
Sagantaa qooqa kamiitu tamsaasa Oduu Qullaa haaraa sadan keessatti hin hammatamne?,"The correct answer is **C: Afaan Jaappaan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Afaan Ingiliziitiifi Afaan Jaappaaniitiin kan duraanuu gabaasaa jiru dhaabbati addunyaa kun teeleviizhiinii, marsariitii fi bilbila sochootuudhaaf Afaan Ispeenii, Xaaliyaanii, akkasumas Afaan Kooriyaatiin sagantaalee eegalee jira.""  This translates to: ""This global phenomenon, for television, magazines and moving newspapers, has already produced programs in Spanish, English, as well as Korean and Japanese.""

The question asks which language *isn't* mentioned as having produced programs related to the ""Oduu Qullaa"" phenomenon.  The text lists Spanish, English, Korean, and Japanese. Therefore, Japanese is the only option *not* explicitly listed as having produced programs.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, tamsaasi Oduu Qullaa haaraa eessatti hin argamu?","The correct answer is **C: Tiyaatira**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""Tamsaasa Oduu Qullaa"" (a type of performance/show) is broadcast on television, radio, and in online formats, and has been shown in English, Japanese, Spanish, French, and Korean. It explicitly mentions these as *global* platforms. 

Of the options provided, theatre (Tiyaatira) is the only one *not* mentioned as a medium for the performance. Therefore, the performance wouldn't be commonly seen in theatres.
"
Dorgomtoota meeqatu Silaalom Guddicha hin xumurre?,"The correct answer is **A: 36**.

The text states: ""Dorgoomtota 116 keessaa 36 fiigichichaan firii wal fakkaata argatan.""  This translates to ""Of the 116 competitors, 36 finished with a parallel run.""  The question asks how many did *not* finish the Giant Slalom. The text then mentions that 36 competitors finished with a parallel run.  Therefore, 116 - 36 = 80 did not finish with a parallel run, but the question asks specifically about *not finishing* the Giant Slalom, and the text indicates 36 of the 116 competitors had a parallel run, implying the remaining did not. The text also states ""Atleetoonni afur gartuu dubartootaa keessaa fiigicha isaanii xumuruu hin dandeenye"" meaning four female athletes could not finish their run. However the main focus here is on the giant slalom, where the question is posed. The text further states ""atleetota 117 keessaa 45 dirree waldorgommii Giyaanti Silaalom irratti qabxii galmeesisuu hin dandeenye"", meaning ""45 of the 117 athletes could not score points in the Giant Slalom."" Since the question specifically asks about *not finishing*, and the text states that 36 finished with a parallel run, 116-36 = 80 did not finish with a parallel run. However option A, 36, is the number of competitors who finished with a parallel run which implicitly means the remaining did not, making it the closest answer.



"
Ibsa armaan gadii keessaa kamtu sirriitti bu’aa dorgommii shaampiyoonaa agarsiisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Dorgommii lammaffaa irratti, Karpenaado Iskaayiri nama biyya Hangaarii dura xumure**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Kan jalqaba ishee Slalom dha, bakka itti isheen fiigicha ishee jalqabaa keessatti Hin Xumurree argatte. Dorgoomtota 116 keessaa 36 fiigichichaan firii wal fakkaata argatan."" This means she didn't finish the Slalom race.
* The text then says: ""Sanyiin ishee biraa, Silaalom Guddicha, sadarkaa ishee kudhanaffaatti xumuruu argiite kan garee taa’umsaa shammaranii yeroo fiigicha waliinii 4:41.30, daqiiqaa 2:11.60 dubaati hafuun isaa duraa Awuustiraliyaa Kilaawudiyaa Loyeesik tti galmeesistee fi yeroo sagalaffan kan xumurte Giyoongi Daaniin Haangaarii daqiiqaa 1:09.02 boodatti hafuuni.""  This means she finished Giant Slalom in 45th place, behind a Hungarian athlete.
* Therefore, in the second race (Giant Slalom), she finished ahead of the athlete from Hungary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iskaayiroonni 45 fiigicha isaanii Silaalom Guddicha keessatti hin xumurre:** The text says *she* finished 45th in Giant Slalom, not that *all* skiers did not finish Giant Slalom.
* **C: Iskaayiroonni baay’een Silalom caalaa Jiyaanti Silalom keessatti xumuran:** The text only provides information about her performance in both races, not about the overall performance of many skiers.
* **D: Kaarpanedon Silalom keessatti kudhanaffaa bahuun xumure:** The text says she didn't finish the Slalom race at all.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa NBA eenyuun addan kuchisiisuuf murteesse?,"The correct answer is **C: Taphataa kamiyyuu qorannoo COVID-19n poozatiiva ta’e.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the NBA paused games ""because of a positive COVID-19 test within the Utah Jazz organization.""
* While the Utah Jazz player's test was the *trigger*, the broader reason for pausing the season was the concern over potential spread of the virus due to a positive test.
* Options A and B are too narrow. The pause wasn't *just* because the season was in progress or because of the Utah Jazz specifically.
* Option D is irrelevant - the passage doesn't mention any issues with the basketball itself.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, waa’ee vaayirasichaa ilaalchisee maaltu NBA yaaddoo keessa galche?","The correct answer is **D: Taphattoonni tapha Uttaah Jaaz irratti poozatiiva ta’aniiru**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Murteen NBA taphataan Uttaah Jaaz vaayurasii COVID-19 qoratamee Pozatiivii ta’uu isaa kan hordofeedha."" This translates to: ""The outbreak in the NBA after a player from the Utah Jazz tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.""

Option D directly reflects this key piece of information. While options A, B, and C are related, they aren't the *direct* reason the NBA paused play. The reason was the positive test of a Utah Jazz player.

Tapha Waashingitan Kaapitaal Atilaanta Tiresharsii waliin taphatan irratti enyutu galchii injifannoo galche?,"The correct answer is **A: Niiklas Baakistroom**.

The text states: ""Kenniinsi kubbaa jalqabaa Ooveechkiinsi galgalaa gara goolii moo’umsa Niiklas Baakistroom isa haaraa galeeti."" which translates to ""The first goal of the match was a new goal by Niklas Backstrom.""
"
Tapha Kaapitaalii fi Tiraasher taphatan irratti galchii isaa 60 ffaa kan baranaa kan galche eenyu dha?,"The correct answer is **C: Aleeksi Oovechkiin**.

The text states: ""Gooliin isaa lammaffaan inni galgala kanaa isa kan waqtichaa 60ffaadha, kan erga bara 1995-96 yeroo Jaaroomir Jaagir fi Maariyoo Leemiyaaksi lamaansaanii fageenya kana qaqqabanii booda taphataa jalqabaa gooliiwwan 60 yookaan isaa ol galche ta’uudhaan."" This translates to: ""His second goal in this round, scored at the 60th minute, is the first time since 1995-96 when Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux had a partnership and scored 60 or more goals in a season.""  This directly links Ovechkiin to the 60+ goal milestone.
"
Baankiin Noorizern Rook mootummaa irraa yoom deeggarsa barbaade?,"The correct answer is **C: Erga gartuun Verjin baankicha bitanii booda**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gareen ‘Verjin’ Sir Riichaardi Biraansan osoo baankichi harka mootummaa hin seenin dura, baankii tufameef gatii bittaa dhiyeessee ture. 2010’tti, osoodhuma harka mootummaa jiraatee iyyuu, bankiin karaa guddaarraa yeroo ammaa Noorzerni Rook plc’n ‘baankii gadhee’ irraa fottoqe, Norzerni Rook (To’ataa Qabeenyaa). Veerjin ‘baankii gaarii’ Rook Kaabaa qofa bite, kaampaanii bulchiinsa qabeenyaa miti.""

This indicates that after Virgin Capital invested in the bank in 2010, Northern Rock quickly moved to become a property investment company, essentially leveraging the government deposit guarantee.  The government guarantee was a crucial factor enabling this transition.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baankii biyyoolessaa erga tahee booda:**  The text doesn't say the bank became ""biyyoolessaa"" (offshore) after becoming a property investment company.
* **B: Yeroo baankichi dhaabbata bulchiinsa qabeenyaa irraa adda bahu:** While the bank *did* become a property investment company, the text emphasizes the role of the government guarantee *after* Virgin's investment.
* **D: Yeroo rakkoo liqa manaa:** While the bank faced mortgage issues, the question is about *how* they obtained the government guarantee, and the text links it specifically to Virgin's investment and subsequent transformation.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, ibsa armaan gadii keessaa kamtu sirriitti walii galtee gartuun Verjin Noorizern Rook waliin taasise agarsiisa?","The correct answer is **A: Garteen Verjin dabalataan dhaabbata bulchiinsa qabeenya Noorizern Rook biteera** (Virgin's stake went beyond just the bank).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Gareen ‘Verjin’ Sir Riichaardi Biraansan osoo baankichi harka mootummaa hin seenin dura, baankii tufameef gatii bittaa dhiyeessee ture. 2010’tti, osoodhuma harka mootummaa jiraatee iyyuu, bankiin karaa guddaarraa yeroo ammaa Noorzerni Rook plc’n ‘baankii gadhee’ irraa fottoqe, Norzerni Rook (To’ataa Qabeenyaa). Veerjin ‘baankii gaarii’ Rook Kaabaa qofa bite, kaampaanii bulchiinsa qabeenyaa miti.""
* **This means:** Virgin didn't just acquire a portion of the bank. They acquired a stake in the *holding company* (Norzerni Rook plc), which then owned the bank.  This is a significant difference and a key detail in understanding the transaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gartuun Verjin baankichi erga kan biyyoolessaa tahee booda bite** (Virgin's stake went after the bank became insolvent) - The text implies Virgin acquired a stake *before* the bank became insolvent.
* **C: Gartuun Verjin baankichaaf yeroo rakkoo hatattamaa liqa manaatti deegarsa taasiseeraafi** (Virgin's stake was taken in light of the bank's financial troubles) - While the bank was facing trouble, the text doesn't suggest Virgin's stake was *taken advantage of* during those troubles. It describes the acquisition itself.
* **D: Gartuun Virjiin caalbaasii isaa kan jalqabaa kan taasise erga baankichi kan biyyoolessaa ta’ee booda dha** (Virgin's initial stake was taken after the bank became insolvent) -  Virgin's initial stake was in the holding company *before* the bank's insolvency.

"Akka kutaa kana keessatti ibsametti, biyya kamtu waliigaltee haala qilleensaa Kiyootoo mallatteessuun miidhama?","The correct answer is **A: Yuunayitid Isteeti**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yuunaayitid Isteetsin qofaa dhaabachiisa, biyyoota guddatan keessaas waliigaltee kanaaf beekamtii kennuu dhiisuu isiitiin biyya qofaa taati."" which translates to ""The United States alone rejects the Kyoto Protocol, and among the major countries, it refuses to provide information on it as a country alone.""

Therefore, the United States is the country mentioned as rejecting the Kyoto Protocol and isolating itself.
"
Mootummaan Awustiraaliyaa duraanii Kiyootoo raggaasisuun maal irratti miidhaa geessisa jedhee yaade?,"The correct answer is **C: Alergii dhagaa cilee**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mootummaa koonsarvatiiviin Awustraaliyaa duraanii Kiyootoo fudhachuu didan, alergii dhagaa cileerratti garmalee hundaa’uu isaa irraa kan ka’e dinagdee miidha jedhanii..."" which translates to ""The previous conservative government of Australia refused to adopt Kyoto, claiming that it would harm its economy due to its allergy to the weed.""

Therefore, the government of Australia argued that Kyoto would harm its **economy** (specifically, their ""allergy"" to the weed which is a metaphor for economic impact). Option C is the closest interpretation of what the text says, even though ""allergy to the weed"" is a metaphorical way of describing the economic impact.
"
Dhukaastoonni harkisa keessa jiran sagantaa kamiif bobbaafaman?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagantaa Sportingii Adamsitoota Waldaa Dhukaastootaa (Program of Sporting Administrators of the NSW Association)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""...sagantaa adamsuu Waldaa Sportingii Dhukasaa Awustiraaliyaa jalatti."" This translates to ""...the program of sporting administrators of the NSW Association.""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Sagantaa Waldaa Dhukaastoota Ispoortii Awustiraaliyaa (Program of the NSW Association of Sporting Administrators)** - While closely related, the text specifies *administrators* within the sporting association.
* **B: Sagantaa Eegumsa Hambaalee fi Paarkii (Program of Wildlife and Park)** - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Sagantaa NPWS (Program of NSW Parks and Wildlife Service)** - While NPWS is involved, the focus is on the sporting administrators' program.



"
Ibsi yaalii to’annoo ilbiisotaa sirritti hin calaqqisiisne isa kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Dhukaastota afurtu filatame**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...namootni dhukkasuuf filatamaan afur nageenyaa fi shaakala ajaja waliigalaafudhatan."" This translates to ""...four people who were chosen to participate in the exercise of safety and emergency."" This directly answers the question about who was involved in the exercise that wasn't conducted in secret.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yaalii sagantichaa isa jalqabaa ta’uu isaa irraan kan ka’e, hin madaalamne** (The fact that it was the first exercise was unexpected and not successful) - This refers to the exercise being unexpected or unsuccessful, not who was involved.
* **B: Dhukaastonni qajeelfama shaakalichaa fudhataniiru** (The people accepted the safety regulations) - While likely true, the text doesn't specifically say they accepted regulations.
* **C: Dhukaastonni reenjarootaan hoogganamu** (The people were led by rangers) - The text mentions they were led by rangers, but the question asks about *who* was involved in the exercise that was not conducted in secret. The focus is on the participants.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, gargar baahuun eessatti argame?","The correct answer is **C: Ragaa moolikularaa keessatti** (Within molecular data).

The text states: ""Akka Haftee-lafee kanaatti, kana jechuun addabaan kan ragaa moolekularraatiin eegame baay’ee dursa."" which translates to ""In this Haftee-lafee, meaning it is very early in terms of being based on molecular data.""

Therefore, the study was conducted within the realm of molecular data.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, maaltu yeroo eegamee duratti uumame?","The correct answer is **C: Xiinxala ragaa moolekularaa (Molecular information)**.

The text states: ""Akka Haftee-lafee kanaatti, kana jechuun addabaan kan ragaa moolekularraatiin eegame baay’ee dursa."" which translates to ""In this deep sea, it means that it was formed very early from molecular information."" 

Therefore, the early formation was from molecular information.

Yeroo tapha viidiyootti taphataan sochii goyyomsuu taasisuuf maal gochuu qaba?,"The correct answer is **C: Seensaroota televiiziyooniitti dhiyessanii kaa’uu (Placing the sensors on the television)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kun akka taphatootni meeshicha qilleensa irra deemsisuun gochaa fi adeemsa tapha vidiiyoo keessaa to’ataniif gargaara."" This translates to ""This helps players experience the action and video game experience as if they were actually inside the screen, by using sensors that track movements on the television screen.""

Therefore, the sensors need to be placed on the television to track the player's movements. Options A and B are incorrect because the sensors are not meant to be inside the console or placed in a random location. Option D is incorrect because the sensors are used to track movement *relative to* the television, not to physically move the controller.
"
Riimoota televiziyoonii fakkaatee kan kalaqame maali?,"The correct answer is **A: Seensaroota to’atan lamaan (Two infrared sensors)**.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: To’attoota Naayinteendoo Riivoluushinii (Nintendo Revolution controllers):** While the sensors are *part of* the controller, the question asks *what* the controller is made of.
* **C: Dhiyeessa Ijoo dubbii (Press conference):**  This is where the announcement was made, not what the controller *is*.
* **D: Koonsoolii Naayinteendoo Riivoluushinii (Nintendo Revolution console):**  The sensors are part of the console's controller, not the console itself.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sana booda gabaasonni boodaa xiyyaarrichi boombiidhaan doorsifamee kallattiin isaa deebifamee gara Afgaanistaanitti jijjiirsifamuudhaan Kaandahaar qubachuu isaa dubbatan.""  This translates to: ""After that, subsequent reports stated that the Xiyyarichi was blown up by a bomb and his body was returned, claiming he was going to capture Kandahar in Afghanistan.""

The question asks what the news agency *didn't* say. The passage doesn't mention the *cause* of the Xiyyarichi's death, only that he was blown up by a bomb.  The other options are explicitly mentioned in the passage.
"
Gabaasa dhiheenyaa Ejensii Oduu Jiinuwaan baase keessatti kan hin eeramne maali?,"The correct answer is **B: Xiyyaarichi hatattamaan lafa qubachuu akka dhorkame (Xiyyaarichi hatattamaan lafa qubachuu akka dhorkame - That Xiyyar was ordered to surrender his body)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that after the initial capture in Xinjiang, Xiyyar was sent to Afghanistan to ""qubachuu isaa dubbatan"" (to speak about his capture/confess). 
* It **doesn't** explicitly say he was *ordered to surrender his body*. While it's implied he was transported, the question asks what the agency's statement **didn't** mention.  The passage focuses on the capture and transfer, not the specifics of any orders regarding his body.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xiyyaarichi ukkaamsamee jira (Xiyyar was killed):** The passage states he was captured alive and transported.
* **C: Xiyyaarichi deebi’ee gara Afgaanistaanitti aka deebi’u taasifame (Xiyyar returned and was sent to Afghanistan):**  The passage states he was initially sent to Afghanistan *after* the capture in Xinjiang, not that he returned.
* **D: Xiyyaarichi doorsifamni boombii akka isa mudate (Xiyyar's body was blown up by the bomb):** The passage says he was blown up by a bomb *after* arriving in Afghanistan, but doesn't say this was mentioned in the initial agency report.

The text states that Saaraa Danuis discussed the Nobel Prize in Literature 2016 and her efforts to get Bob Dylan to accept it. The text specifically mentions ""waa’ee mo’icha Nobelii litirecharii 2016"" which translates to ""the topic of the Nobel Prize in Literature 2016"".
"

"
Waadaa seenuun “tarkaanfii guddaa” ta’uu isaa irratti eenyutu yaada kenne?,"The correct answer is **A: Warra Pireesii** (The Press).

The question asks who commented on the statement that the agreement was a ""major breakthrough."" The passage states that President Bush said this, and the question asks *who* thought it was a major breakthrough.  The press (Warra Pireesii) would be the entity reporting on and commenting on such a statement. The passage doesn't state that Bush himself was surprised or that the Korean Peninsula thought it was a breakthrough.



"

The text clearly states: ""Siwiidiniifi biyyoota 28 biroof chaappaa 1,000 ol qopheesse."" This translates to ""He collected over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

This indicates a valve malfunction (equipment failure) caused the oil to leak.
* Options A, B, and D are not directly supported by the text. While other factors *could* be involved, the text points to a faulty valve as the immediate cause.



"
Maaliif vaalviin gadhiisaa baname?,"The correct answer is **A: Taankaricha keessa babal’iinsi sababa ho’a irraa ka’ee waan jiruuf** (There was an explosion inside the tanks).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Baduun ibsaa sababa ajaja karaa abiddaa dhufeen kan ka’ee vaalviin balaaf taa’ee banamuun akkasumas zaayitaa hin qulqulloofne bakka Fort Greely..."" (Without warning, the pipeline was damaged, and the valve failed, preventing oil from flowing to Fort Greely...).  Later, it says: ""Taankii keessattii irra kanka’e amma Roobiii sa’a boodaatti ujummoon taankii dhimmisaa turani."" (The tank that was affected was shut down after a few hours).

This strongly indicates an explosion or some other internal issue within the tank caused the valve to fail and prevent oil flow. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"Yeroo ammaatti, bishaanni Naayinz Waard keessaa ol ka’iinsi isaa hangami?","The correct answer is **C: hanga mudhiitti**.

The text states: ""Bishaan mudhii-ga’u olka’eera akkuma afaan galaanaa guutee irra yaa’e."" This translates to ""The flood rose to the height of the mud."" Therefore, the flood is currently at the height of the mud.
"
Yeroo obomboleettii Katriinaatti Naayinz Waard keessatti maaltu uumame?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishaan lolaa bal’inni isaa fiitii 100 ture**

The passage states: ""Bishaan hidhii daangaa isaarra ba’ee kutaa fiitii 100 bal’atuun dhangala’aa jira."" This translates to ""The wound on his leg bled, and a strip of 100 feet of cloth was used to bandage it.""  Therefore, option A is the accurate reflection of what happened.
"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Haamiltaniin kan hin mirkanoofne kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Carraa dhukkubsatoonni biroon vaayirasichaan qabamuu qaban.**

The passage states: ""Hospitalichi ulaagaa yookin adeemsa ittisa faalamuu to'atu hordofeera, innis dhukkubsata kanneen biroorraa qofaatti baasuu, warri hafan akka hin faalamneef."" This translates to: ""The hospital undertook a task or service of relief, but it only dealt with other illnesses, and did not accept those with the virus.""

Therefore, the hospital did not accept patients suffering from the virus (Ebola).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bakka dhukkubsatoonni itti imalan** (The place where the patients were located): The passage doesn't mention anything about the hospital refusing to accept patients based on their location.
*   **C: Adeemsi sirriin kan kordofame ta’uuf dhiisuu isaa** (Its refusal due to the secret system): The passage doesn't mention any secrecy being a factor in the hospital's decision.
*   **D: Haala dhukkubsataa kan yeroo ammaa** (The current state of illness): The passage indicates that the hospital was only addressing other illnesses, not specifically the *current* state of illness related to Ebola.

"
Wanta saayintistootni qorataniii adda baafachuu barbaadan maali?,"The correct answer is **D: Lafti akkamiin akka uumamte (How the Earth was formed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saayintistoonni akkaata pilaanetiin itti uumamte hubachuuf abdii qabu, keesumaayyuu akkaata itti lafti uumamte.""  This translates to: ""Scientists have hoped to find clues about how the planet was formed, or rather, how life on Earth was formed.""  The question asks what scientists wanted to discover through studying the comet. The passage explicitly mentions understanding the formation of Earth and the origin of life.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Koomeetiin lafa waliin yoom walitti bu’e (How the comet interacted with the Earth):** While the comet's interaction is *part* of the broader question, the passage is focused on the *overall* formation.
*   **B: Pirootiiniin akkamiin akka uumame (How proteins were formed):**  The passage mentions proteins but doesn't state that this was the primary focus of the investigation.
*   **C: Orgaanikaa maalii akka ta’e (What organic matter is):**  The passage mentions organic matter as being able to support protein production and sustain life, but it isn't the core question the scientists were trying to answer about the Earth's formation.

The text states: ""Konkolaataawwan duudaan ujummoo seensaa cuufuuf oolan, konkolaachistoonni karaa akka irraa jal’ifataniif ajajuuf ammoo gargaarsi poolisoota 80 qophii ture."" 

Translation: ""The police used speed traps to stop drivers, and 80 police officers were ready to help arrest drivers who started on the road.""

This directly indicates the speed traps were used to prevent drivers from beginning their journey.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, osoo ogeessi suuraa kaasu konkolaataadhaan hin rukutamin dursa maaltu hin uumamne?","The correct answer is **B: Ogeessi suuraa konkolaataa isaa Sepuulveda Boulevardi cina dhaabe.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""MarsariitiiN Oduu bashannanaa TMZ akka namichi suuraa kaasuu makiina dhaabe ni hubata bakka fallaa Sepuulveda Boulevarditi fi suuraa kaasu yaale osoo Poolisichi karaa hin qaxxamuriin fi itti hin fufin..."" (Mararitien Oduu happily TMZ knows the man who drove a marijuana-dispensing machine stopped at Sepulveda Boulevard and sprayed weed while the police didn't stop or chase him...).

This directly answers the question of what happened *before* the police got involved and the situation escalated. He drove his marijuana-dispensing machine to Sepulveda Boulevard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ogeessi suurichaa karaa irratti akka deebi’uuf Paatiroolii karaa guddaadhaan ajajame:** While patrol cars were likely dispatched, the passage doesn't state this as the *first* event.
* **C: Ogeessi suuraa, suuraa poolisii dhaabateei kaafateera:** The passage says the police *didn't* stop or chase him initially.
* **D: Ogeessi suuraa, suuraa Beyber argachuu danda’eera:** This is irrelevant to the question and not mentioned in the passage.
"
Osoo konkolaataan hin rukutamin dura ogeessi suurichaa maal hojjechuuf yaalaa ture?,"The correct answer is **A: Sepuulveda Boulevarditti konkolaataa dhaabeera (Drove on Sepulveda Boulevard)**.

The text states: ""MarsariitiiN Oduu bashannanaa TMZ akka namichi suuraa kaasuu makiina dhaabe ni hubata bakka fallaa Sepuulveda Boulevarditi fi suuraa kaasu yaale..."" which translates to ""Marjorie Oduy, happily on TMZ, knows that the man who gave the woman a drink drove to Sepulveda Boulevard and gave her a drink...""

The text explicitly states: ""Guyyoota hedduuf manatti adda kan of baasan ta’us, haalli pirezidaantichaa tasgabbaa’aadha."" This translates to: ""Although he has been isolated for many days, the President's condition is good.""

Therefore, the President is seen in good condition despite having a positive virus test."
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee pirezidantichaa dhugaan isa kami?","The correct answer is **C: Quunnamtii bilbilaa taasisuu ni danda’a**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""yeroo kana haala gaarirran jira hojii koos bilbilaan mana taa’ee dalaguu nan danda’a."" (In this unusual situation, I can continue my work by working from home via phone.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhaqna gubaa hin qabu (No sense of humor):** The text doesn't mention anything about the president's sense of humor.
* **B: Torbanoota muraasaaf manuma kan turu dha (Only a minor illness):** The text says the president's condition is ""tasgabbaa’aadha"" (not serious), but it doesn't classify it as just a minor illness. It mentions a virus affecting his power center.
* **D: Waa’ee vaayirasichaa irratti dhimma muraasa ni qaba (Has some concern about the virus):** While the president acknowledges the virus's impact, the text focuses on his ability to continue working despite it, rather than expressing concern about the virus itself.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, Tirooppikaal Saayikiloon Goonun akka salphatu yoomitti eegama?","The correct answer is **A: Osoo Maaldivsiin hin qaqqabin** (By not crossing the Maldives).

Here's why:

The question states the tropical cyclone Goon reached the Maldives at a speed of 240 km/h. The information also mentions it was initially traveling at 83 km/h and was expected to slow down.  The core implication is that the cyclone **did not cross the Maldives** because it slowed down significantly after reaching the islands.  The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Yeroo saffisi bubbee 83 km/h tti gadi bu’u** (By reducing the speed of the bubble to 83 km/h) - While the speed did decrease, it's not the *reason* it stopped/reached the Maldives; it's a consequence of it.
*   **C: Osoo tuqaa olaanaa hin dhaqqabin** (By not crossing a large distance) - The distance isn't the key; it's the speed and its resulting impact.
*   **D: Osoo bubbeen sa’aatiidhaan maayilii 149 hin dhaqqabin** (By not traveling at a speed of 149 miles per hour) - This is just another way of saying it didn't travel at 83 km/h, which is incorrect. It *was* traveling at 83 km/h.

Therefore, the most logical and directly supported answer is that the cyclone didn't cross the Maldives due to slowing down.



"
Saffisi bubbee olaanaa Tirooppikaal Saayikiloon Goonu meeqa?,"The correct answer is **C: sa’aatiidhaan maayilii 149**.

The question states the typhoon traveled 240 kilometers in a certain time, and that the speed was 83 km/h. The question then asks for the *speed* of the typhoon.

To find the speed, we need to divide the distance by the time.  However, the question *already gives* the speed as 83 km/h. The 240 km traveled in a certain time is irrelevant to finding the speed, *unless* we are meant to infer the time. 

But since the question directly gives the speed as 83 km/h, and is asking for the speed, and we have to choose from the provided options, we must assume the distance is given to distract.  The options mix kilometers and miles. 

The problem states the typhoon traveled 240 kilometers, which is equal to 149 miles. The speed was given as 83 km/h.

Therefore, the most accurate answer from the provided choices is ""sa’aatiidhaan maayilii 149"" (at a speed of 149 miles per hour), because that is equivalent to the 240 km traveled.  It's worth noting this is a bit confusingly worded. If the problem intended to ask for the speed, it should have stated that directly.



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa akka amala Kariiniya bireevisitti kan hin ilaalamne kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Uumamaan kan mudatu dha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dhiibbaawwan uumamaa haalota tokko tokko gidduu seenuu ni danda’u, akka saphaphuun kun lakkoofsaan dafee dabalu gochuudhaan."" (Living organisms can also put things into the middle [of them], such as by accumulating a lot of mucus.) This indicates that organisms *produce* mucus, not that they *decompose* (mudatu) it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gosa saphaphuu keessaa dha (It is a type of mucus):** The passage explicitly states that mucus is produced by organisms.
* **B: Narvii namootaa hojii dhaabsisuu danda’a (It can stimulate nerve function in humans):** The passage says mucus is produced by mucus-secreting organisms, and that mucus stimulates human nerves.
* **C: Seelii danuu dha (It is a single-celled organism):** The passage states that *some* living organisms that produce mucus are single-celled organisms (Kariinya bireevis).



"
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa Kariiniya bireevisin gochuu kan hin dandeenye kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Narvoota qurxummii keessa hojii dhaabsisuu danda’a** (Can't operate nerve functions).

Here's why:

The passage states that *Kariinya bireevis* is a simple organism (single-celled) and that neurons (nerve cells) are found in more complex organisms.  Therefore, a single-celled organism like *Kariinya bireevis* **cannot** perform nerve functions. The other options are things that single-celled organisms *can* do, according to the passage.

"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu sababa Haariikeenii Feliishiyaatiin hin uumamu?","The correct answer is **C: Balaqqisa irraa deebii (Recovery from a drought)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...amma balaqqeessa'uun ajjabame."" which translates to ""...is suffering *because of* a drought.""  It then mentions the wells are now considered ""faayida qabeessa"" (productive/beneficial) *after* being drought-stricken and now having water. This indicates a *recovery from* the drought, not a cause *of* the drought.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuufama faayidaa qabeessa (Productive/Beneficial Wells):** The text explicitly states the wells are now productive, a result of overcoming the drought.
*   **B: Rooba bakakkaa of keessaa qabu (Wells containing water):** The text mentions the wells have water (inchii 6.34 gahaa), which is a direct result of the recovery.
*   **D: Lolaa karaa irraa (Roadside water):** The text doesn't mention anything about water being from roadsides.



Therefore, the only option that *isn't* a cause of Feliishiya Haariikeenii's situation, but rather a result of overcoming it, is recovery from the drought.



"
Waa’ee Haariikeenii Feliishiyaa ibsa kamtu soba dha?,"The correct answer is **A: Bu’aan rooba roobe Oohuu fayyade.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hammi roobaa, geejii Oohuu irratti inchii 6.34 gahaa jiru, """"faayida qabeessa"""" jedhamee ibsama."" This translates to ""All the weather instruments, including the Oohuu geezer, show a reading of 6.34 inches, labeled as ""beneficial.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jalqabatti gara obomboleettii gosa 4tti osoo hin jijjiiramne dura akka bubbee tiroopikaalaatti ramadame:** The text says the area *drove* into a tropical bubble, not that it was *labeled* as one.
*   **C: Odolawwan hedduun kuufama kan argatan dha:** While the text mentions strong winds, it doesn't say the area *consistently* experiences them.
*   **D: Roobi muraasi balaqqisa of keessaa qabu:** The text indicates the weather instruments are *currently* suffering from the heavy rainfall, but doesn't say the instruments themselves have inherent destructive power.

Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the given text."
Ibsi waa’ee bu’aa Piriiksi Guddaa Hangaariyaanii kan 2009 sirriitti agarsiisuu kami?,"The correct answer is **C: Pikuweet Jr. ergasii ari’ameera (Piquet Jr. was blamed)**.

The passage states: ""Piikuweet Jr. kan ari’ame bara 2009 Piriiksii guddaaHaangaariin booda."" which translates to ""Piquet Jr. was blamed after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernaando Aloonsoo balaa mudate keessatti hirmaateera (Fernando Alonso was involved in the accident):** While Fernando Alonso was involved, the passage focuses on Piquet Jr.'s blaming.
* **B: Pikuweet Jr. injifannoo argateera (Piquet Jr. received a penalty):** The passage doesn't explicitly mention a penalty; it states he was blamed.
* **D: Balaa mudate keessatti warri nageenya konkolaataa hirmaataniiru (Safety car officials were involved in the accident):** The passage mentions the safety car was deployed, but it doesn't say safety car *officials* were involved in the accident itself.
"
Balaan kuni yoom mudate?,"The correct answer is **A: Battala Aloonsoon boolla keessatti dhaabate (Alonso's tire blew out)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pikuweet Jr. Piriiks Guddicha Singaappoor 2008 keessatti burkutaa’e, battaluma boolli jalqabaa Fernaandoo Aloonsoof dhaabatee booda..."" which translates to: ""Piquet Jr. crashed at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, after Fernando Alonso's tire blew out...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yeroo konkolaattonni biroon boba’aa guuttatan (When other cars crashed):** While other crashes might have occurred, the text focuses on Alonso's tire blowout as the initial cause.
*   **C: Osoo warri nageenya konkolaataa hin dhufin (The safety car didn't come):** The text states the safety car *did* come.
*   **D: Erga Pikuweet boba’aaf ba’ee (When Piquet Jr. came out of the crash):** The text describes the *cause* of Piquet Jr.'s crash, not his exit from it.



"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kanneen armaan gadii keessaa kamtu yeroo qorattoonni jalqaba amanan caalaa xiqqaa fudhate?","The correct answer is **C: Hormaata sanyii gara garaa gidduu (Intermediate beak variation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the researchers initially believed the formation of the finches with different beak sizes was due to Darwin's finch principle (adaptive radiation driven by competition for resources). However, they found evidence suggesting that the intermediate beak variations were *more* prevalent than expected under this model.  This implies the researchers underestimated or didn't fully appreciate the role of intermediate beak sizes initially.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uumama sanyii (Speciation):** The passage mentions speciation occurred, but it doesn't state that researchers initially doubted it.
*   **B: Gabaasa waa’ee sanyii (Beak morphology/shape):**  The passage focuses on *variations* in beak morphology, not the morphology itself. Researchers were aware of beak differences.
*   **D: Jijjiirama tirannaa sanyii (Beak tip/point):** The passage mentions beak *sizes* and *shapes*, not just the tips."
Kanneen armaan gadii keessaa qorattootaan kan hin gabaafamne kami?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanyiin haaraan eessatti akka uumaman (How the new species of finches evolved)**.

The text explicitly states that the researchers investigated *how* the new finch species evolved, specifically relating it to Darwin's finch studies, the beak size selection pressure, and the differences between *Geopiza fortis* and *Geospiza conirostris*. The text doesn't focus on the duration of the evolutionary process (B), the names of the finches (C), or the role of other organisms in the evolutionary process (D). Therefore, the evolution of the finches themselves is the central question addressed.
"
Agarsiisi siidaa loonii eessatti taasifame?,"The correct answer is **B: Magaalaa Buchaaresti keessatti** (In the city of Bucharest).

The text states: ""Sagantaan artii sunis qaama duula Galma Magaalaa Buchaarestii..."" which translates to ""The art exhibition started in the Galma Magaalaa Buchaaresti...""

Therefore, the exhibition started in Bucharest.
"
Ibsa armaan gadii keessaa sirriitti agarsiisa siidaa loonii kan mul’isu kami?,"The correct answer is **B: Galma magaalaa Buchaarestiin kalaqame.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sagantaan artii sunis qaama duula Galma Magaalaa Buchaarestii..."" which translates to ""The art event is the expression of the word of the Bucharest City Hall...""  This implies the city of Bucharest *created* or *named* the art event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Magaalota kanneen “kalaqaan” beekaman keessatti qofaa taasifame** (It was only created in cities known as ""creative"" ones): The text doesn't say it was *only* created in creative cities. It specifically mentions Bucharest.
* **C: Taatee agarsiisa aartii yeroo gannaatti guutummaa kibbabaha Awurooppaatti ta’e dha** (And the art exhibition was completely European during the time of its creation): The text mentions the exhibition's historical context (Waxabajjii fi Hagayya jidduu - between the years of Waxabajjii and Hagayya), but not that it was exclusively European during that time.
* **D: Akka addunyaatti taatee agarsiisa aartii hawwaasaa isa guddaa dha** (It was not an international art exhibition, but a large local one):  The text states it's a ""guddaati"" (large) international art exhibition.

Therefore, option B is the only one directly supported by the text.
"
Sababa Raashiyaan fayyadama II-76s akka dhorkitu taasise maalidha?,"The correct answer is **B: Balaa mudate (Accident)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ruusiyaan Il-76s yeroof lafa tursiiste, erga balaan sun qaqqabeen booda."" This translates to ""Russia has been using Il-76s for a long time, but after the accident...""

The passage describes a productive accident (""balaa ulfaataa"") and then mentions an accident (""balaa"") that occurred, leading to the aircraft being grounded. This indicates an accident is the reason for the grounding, not the reason for its use in the first place.
"
II-76 maali dha?,"The correct answer is **D: Baabura (Airplane)**.

The text states that the Il-76 was a Russian and Soviet military transport aircraft. The description of the accident (engine failure during takeoff) further supports it being an airplane.
"
Ze Siimpsansiif gartuu barreessitootaa eenyu qacare?,"The correct answer is **A: Biruuksi**.

The text states: ""Bara 1989 tti inni The Simpisans uumee Biruuksi fi Girooyiningi waliin ta’uun..."" which translates to ""In 1989, he created The Simpsons in collaboration with Biruuksi and Girooyiningi...""

Therefore, Biruuksi is listed as a co-creator of The Simpsons.
"
"Akka Filiyuuki jettetti, yaada gaarii fi kaka’umsa kennuuf eenyutu ergaafi?","The correct answer is **D: Namoota dhuunfaa dhiiraa fi durbaa (People with experience in grief and hardship).**

Here's why:

The text states that Filiyuuk is a person who has experienced hardship and has overcome it. She offers guidance and support to other women facing similar challenges. The text explicitly mentions she wants to help women ""atteeti ergameeni durba fi dhiira dhuunfaa lamaniini qorichi ulfa dhorku akka qoricha barbaachisuti akka fudhatamuufi"" (those who have experienced early hardship and double sorrow, so that their creative potential can be fulfilled). This suggests that people who have *lived through* hardship are best equipped to offer empathetic and effective support.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Doktaroota (Doctors):** While doctors can offer medical and psychological support, the text focuses on emotional and personal guidance, not clinical treatment.
*   **B: Aktivistoota fayyaa shamarranii (Experienced health activists):** Health activists may provide valuable resources, but the text emphasizes personal experience and shared understanding.
*   **C: Dhiirota (Grief counselors):** Grief counselors specialize in helping people cope with grief, but the text's focus is broader, encompassing hardship and resilience, not just bereavement.

Therefore, the most fitting answer is **D**, as Filiyuuk's approach aligns with the idea that those who have faced similar struggles are best positioned to offer meaningful support."
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, namoonni muraasni warri durbaa ol kaasanii akka hin dubbanne kan barbaadan maali?","The correct answer is **A: Dhiirota dhuunfaa (Sexual desire)**.

The text states that Filiyuuk helps women who feel a lack of sexual desire and want to experience pleasure. It also mentions helping them achieve their sexual desires and urges. Therefore, ""dhiirota dhuunfaa"" (sexual desire) is the most accurate answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gatii kaffaltii fayyaa (Good health)** - While important, the text doesn't directly link Filiyuuk to good health in this context.
* **C: Fayyummaa durbootaa (Sexual stamina)** - While related, the text focuses more on the desire and pleasure aspect rather than stamina.
* **D: Filiyuuki** - This is the product itself, not what people want from it.
"
"Akka kutaa kanaatti, kutaan pilaaneetii baay’ee jijjiiramu isa kami?","The correct answer is **A: Lafa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hamma nuti beeknuti, Taayitaan caalaa kan qaama pilaanetii kana ibsuu danda’u tokko qofatu jira, maqaan isaas Lafa dha,” which translates to ""Everything we know, there is only one planet that can tell you about its body, its name is Earth.""

Therefore, the planet being referred to is Earth (Lafa).
"
Lagoonnii fi harri dhangala’oo ifa of keessa dabarsan qaban kutaa pilaaneetii isa kam keessatti argamu?,"The correct answer is **B: Taayitaan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hamma nuti beeknuti, Taayitaan caalaa kan qaama pilaanetii kana ibsuu danda’u tokko qofatu jira, maqaan isaas Lafa dha.” This translates to: ""All that we know, there is only one thing that can describe the body of this planet better than Jupiter, and its name is Earth.""  The passage is describing Earth, and refers to it as ""Lafa"" (Earth). The description of lagoons and shimmering light inside something is a description of Earth's oceans.
"
Argannoowwan kana keessaa bu’aa argannoo baalle kan hin taane maali?,"The correct answer is **C: Xiyyeeffannoo jijjiirama tirataa gara baalleettii**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *evolution* of the dinosaur's tail and how it wasn't just for balance. It highlights the discovery of different types of tail bones (barbices and barbiyuulsii) and the theory that they were used for display or communication.

Option C, ""Xiyyeeffannoo jijjiirama tirataa gara baalleettii"" (Intriguing transformation of dinosaur tails), best captures this focus on the *change* and *purpose* of the tail over time. The other options are not directly addressed in the passage:

*   **A: Halluu baallee mataa bineeldotaa** (Dinosaur tail as a visual aid for animals) - While the tail might have been visible, the passage doesn't emphasize its use as a visual aid in general.
*   **B: Hubannoo baalleen lola keessatti kan hin fayyadamne ta’uu** (The knowledge that dinosaur tails were not used in the forest) - The passage doesn't mention the forest, so this option is irrelevant.
*   **D: Mirkaneeffannoo daayinoosaroonni baay’een akka baallee qaban** (The observation that many dinosaurs had tails) - The passage doesn't focus on the general observation that dinosaurs had tails. It's about *what the tails were used for*.



"
Baallen daayinoosarootaa maal hin qabu?,"The correct answer is **A: Baarbulees (Barbisii fi baarbiyuulsii)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Argannaon akkasuma waa’ee guddinaa ballee simbiraa waa akka baraan taasise. Baalleen daayinoosarii qoochoo sirnaan guddate, kan reeykiis jedhamu waan hin qabaneef, garuu caasaalee baallee kan biroo — baarbisii fi baarbiyuulsii — waan qabaniif..."" which translates to: ""We also see that the growth of the spines was established like the years. The spines of dinosaurs grew upwards in a straight line, did not have what is called reiki, but had other spines – barbisii and baarbiyuulsii...""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Raachiis (Raachiis)** - Not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Qoochoo ga’eessotaa (Qoochoo ga’eessotaa)** - The text says the spines grew upwards, not outwards in a branch-like way.
* **D: Cina gara gadiin haalluu diimaa (Cina gara gadiin haalluu diimaa)** - This translates to ""deep, strong bone core,"" which is not what the text focuses on regarding what the spines *had*. It discusses what the spines *were* - barbisii and baarbiyuulsii.



"
Ibsa armaan gadii keessaa waa’ee ZMapp sirrii kan hin taane kami?,"The correct answer is **D: Akka qorannoon agarsiisutti faayidaan inni kennu kan dura yaadamee gadi dha** (The benefit it offers, as shown by studies, is greater than previously thought).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""garuu qorannooleen seera-qabeessi kan argisiisan, inni du’a ittisuuf amma yaadamee caalaa faayidaa gad-aanaa akka qabuudha.""  This translates to ""however, studies have shown that it has a far greater benefit than previously thought for curing the disease.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Farra qaamaa irraa hojjetame (Derived from a cell culture):** The text mentions it's derived from a cell culture (farra qaamaa tokko, Zmapp). This isn't what's being questioned.
* **B: Bakka kanaan dura hubame yaaluuf ni danda’a garuu du’a irraa hin oolchu (Can be discovered previously but not extracted from the cell culture):**  The text doesn't say it *was* discovered previously.  It discusses its development and subsequent research.
* **C: Yaalii PALM keessatti akka to’attootaatti fayyada (Benefits as a preventative measure in PALM trials):** While the text mentions trials in PALM, it's the *benefit for curing the disease* that's being questioned, not its preventative use.



Therefore, option D directly addresses the information in the text about the unexpected and greater benefits of ZMapp as revealed by research.
