ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ነቲ ኣኮርዲዮን ብዕዉት መገዲ ንኽትጻወት ዘኽእለካ ቕኑዕ ምኽሪ ጌርካ ዘይርአ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ተወሳኺ መጠን ድምጺ እንተ ደሊኻ፡ ነቶም መፋትሕ እትወቕዓሉ ሓይሊ ወስኽ** (If you want to add more volume, exert force on the keys).

Here's why:

The passage states that to get a louder sound on an accordion (like adding more volume), you shouldn't try to force the solution. Instead, you need to use more *effort* (ሓይሊ) to push the keys. Option A directly reflects this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጥንካረኻ ምእንቲ ክትዕቅብ ዘየድሊ ምንቅስቓስ ናብ ዝነኣሰ ደረጃ ኣውርዶ** (Reduce the movement that doesn't help you improve your strength to a higher level): This contradicts the passage's advice to exert more force.
* **C: ህድእ ኢልካ ኢድካ ሒዝካ ነቲ መዘኻኸሪታት ተጠንቂቕካ ጸሓፎም** (Hold the bellows gently and carefully and push them):  The passage advises *not* to hold the bellows gently if you want a louder sound.
* **D: ተወሳኺ መጠን ድምጺ ምእንቲ ኽትረክብ በቶም ትሰርሓሎም ታሕተዎት ኣቢልካ ናህርኻ ወስኽ** (If you want to try adding more volume, instead of pulling them, push them): This is incorrect because the passage doesn't suggest alternating between pushing and pulling the bellows to increase volume; it advises exerting more force when pushing.

ኣኮርዲዮን ክትጻወት ከለኻ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየኖት እዮም ነቲ ድምጺ ኸተዛይዶ ዝሕግዙኻ?,"The correct answer is **C: ውሑድ ጸቕጢ (Less Effort)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that to achieve a wider range of sounds on an accordion (like adding more notes), you don't need to exert more force or speed. Instead, you need to use *less effort* (less ""ጸቕጢ"" - effort/energy). The passage uses the piano as an example - you don't need to hit the keys harder to produce different notes. 

Therefore, a reduced effort allows for a wider dynamic range and more subtle control over the sound, akin to playing with more ""ጸቕጢ"" (effort/energy) on an accordion.

እቶም ኣብ ተለቪዥን ዝርኣዩ ስእልታት ስለምንታይ እዩ ወሰን ወሰኖም ዝቝረጽ?,"The correct answer is **D: ንኡስ ኣርእስትታት ናብ ታሕቲ ኣመና ኣጸጊዕኻ ንምቝራጽ (Small subtitles are compressed downwards)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ቪድዮ ኣብ ታሕቲ ንኡስ ኣርእስቲ እንተዚህልዋ ኸኣ ምሉእ ብምሉእ ኣይርአን እዩ"" which translates to ""If the video is placed under small subtitles, it is not seen completely.""  This indicates that the small subtitles are causing the video to be compressed or obscured downwards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ንኡስ ኣርእስቲታት ንምፍቃድ (To like small subtitles):** The text implies the opposite - the small subtitles are causing a problem.
* **B: እቲ ስእሊ ነቲ እስክሪን ብምሉኡ ስለዝመልኦ (Because the image fills the entire screen):**  The text doesn't suggest the image filling the screen is the reason for compression, but rather something else.
* **C: ናብ ካልእ ዓይነት ቅዲታት ብቐሊሉ ንምቕያር ንምፍቃድ (To easily change to other sources):** This has no relation to the issue of image compression.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""ቪድዮ ኣብ ታሕቲ ንኡስ ኣርእስቲ እንተዚህልዋ ኸኣ ምሉእ ብምሉእ ኣይርአን እዩ"" which translates to ""If the video is placed below small subtitles, it won't be viewed completely."" This indicates that only parts of the subtitles are being scanned.
* The text also mentions ""ካብ መጠን ንላዕሊ ስካን"" (overscan) which is related to the entire screen being cut off, but the question asks about issues *when creating a DVD*.
* Options A and C are incorrect because the text describes a *lack* of complete screen display, not a full screen display issue.
* Option D is irrelevant as the text doesn't mention ""offset scanning.""

The text states: ""E.A. July 6 a New York soldier sent to George Washington July 9 they also sent to London on Happy 10."" This indicates the ""Danlop Broadside"" reached London.

The text states: ""ስታርክ ወታደራት አብ ሰሜናዊ መወዳእታ ናይቲ ባዕዳዊ ዘሎ ቦታ በቲ ሓፁር ቦታ ሒዞም ይርከቡ।"" which translates to ""Stark's soldiers marched with the bluff at the northern end of the bay.""



"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ወተሃደራት ስታርክ ሓጹሮም ዘስፋሕፍሕዎ መዓስ እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **B: እቶም ስሩዓት ነቲ ባላ ምስ ሓለፍዎ (They quickly crossed the bay).**

Here's why:

The text states: ""እቲ ንኡስ ማዕበል ብሚስቲክ ሩባ አቢሉ አብ ሰሜን ምብራQ ፔኒንሱዌላ ክፍተት ምስ ፈጠረ ብፍጥነት ነዚ ሓፁር ብሓፂር ናይ እምኒ መንደቅ ንሰሜን ገፅ እስካብ አብታ ፀግዒ ማይ ነሽተይ ገምገም አናዊሖሞ (The small swell, having opened a gap with Mystic Rubah in northern Peninsular Venezuela, quickly crossed this bay and, with the help of the current, sailed north to the other side of the estuary).""

This clearly indicates that the soldiers crossed the bay quickly. The other options are not supported by the text."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሓደ ኻብቲ ኣብ ቻይና ዝነበረ ዓመጽ ዝመልኦ መዋእል ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: መዋእል ሺኣን (The Warring States period)**.

The text explicitly states: "" ኣብቲ እዋን እቲ ልዕሊ ዅሉ ዚፍለጥ እቲ ኣብ መንጎ ሃንን ስርወ-ንግስነት ጂንን ን60 ዓመት ዝጸንሐ ሰለስተ መንግስትታት እዩ። ኣብቲ እዋን እቲ ኣብ መንጎ እቶም ዝፋን ንምርካብ ዝቃለሱ ዝነበሩ ብዙሓት ልዑላን ብርቱዕ ውግእ ተኻይዱ ኢዩ። እተን ሰለስተ መንግስትታት ሓደ ኻብቲ ኣብ ታሪኽ ጥንታዊቻይና ኻብ እተፈጸመ ኣዝዩ ደም ዝመልኦ መዋእል እየን ነይረን ብኣሽሓት ዚቝጸሩ ሰባት ኣብቲ ኣብ ሺያን ዚርከብ ዓብዪ ቤተ-መንግስቲ ኾፍ መበሊ ኾፍ ንምባል ኣብ ዝገበርዎ ቓልሲ ሞይቶም እዮም።""

This translates to: ""At that time, the most prominent thing was the three kingdoms that had lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Warring States. At that time, many princes fought fiercely and waged wars. One of these three kingdoms was a very bloody period in the history of ancient China, where hundreds of thousands of people died in the large palaces in the Warring States fighting to conquer the enemy.""

Therefore, the Warring States period (መዋእል ሺኣን) is described as a particularly bloody and devastating period.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ብዛዕባ ናብ ሰበኽ ሳግም ደረጃ ዝኣትዉ ሰራዊት ጻጸ ሓቂ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣብ እዋን ለይቲ ይሰፍሩ (They deploy at night)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Abl birki sabek sagim serawit ab iwan layti yewafeeru..."" which translates to ""When a hostile camp is established, the army deploys at night.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ውሑድ ቀረብ መግቢ ኣለዎም (They have a single quick meal):** The text mentions a ""sugumtawi medrek"" (a scavenging stage) that starts when food is scarce, implying that they don't have a single quick meal.
* **C: ድሕሪ 17 መዓልታት ዝቕየሩ ሰፈራት ይሰርሑ (They settle after 17 days):** The text states that the ""nane nefsewekafe"" (hostile encampments) last for approximately 17 days. It doesn't say they *settle* after that time, just that the encampments themselves last that long.
* **D: ኣብ እዋን ቀትሪ ይጓዓዙ (They travel during the day):** The text says they deploy *at night* when a hostile camp is established."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ኣየናይ መግለጺ እዩ ነቲ ሰፈር ሰራዊት ጻጸ ኣብ እዋን ሰበኽ ሳግም ደረጃ ዝነበሮ ልምዲ ብልክዕ ዘንጸባርቕ?,"The correct answer is **B: ከይሰፈሩ ን17 መዓልታት ይጓዓዙ** (They don't settle and travel for 17 days).

Here's why:

* The passage states: "" ኣብዚ መድረኽ እዚ፣ እቲ ዕስለ መዓልታዊ ዝቕየሩ ግዝያዊ ሰፈራታት ይሰርሕ። ኣብ ጻንሒት እቲ ደረጃ ሓደ ዓይነት ሰፈራት እዮም ዝጥቀሙ ንኣስታት 17 መዓልთታት ይፀንሑ。"" (In this stage, the daily temporary settlements are carried out. The same type of settlements are used during the period of approximately 17 days.)
* This indicates that the soldiers don't settle in one place for long; they travel for approximately 17 days without settling.
* Option B directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ እዋን ለይቲ ሰፈራት ይሃንጹ** (They build settlements during the night): The passage mentions building settlements, but not specifically during the night.
* **C: መዓልታዊ ሰፈራቶም ይቕይሩ** (Their daily settlements remain): The passage explicitly states that the settlements are *temporary* and don't remain for long.
* **D: ኣብ ጻንሒት እቲ ደረጃ ሓደ ዓይነት ሰፈራት እዮም ዝጥቀሙ** (They use the same type of settlements during this stage): While the passage mentions using the same type of settlements, this is not the *best* description of their behavior in terms of their movement.



"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ግዳማዊ ምልክታትት እናሃለወ ኽነሱ ዝቕጽል ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ብውሕሉል መንገዲ ዝግበሩ ውሽጣዊ ዑደታት (Well-regulated internal cycles)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that physiological and biological rhythms are often influenced by natural cycles and environmental factors. 
* It emphasizes that these rhythms are **free-flowing** and not dictated by strict rules.
* **Well-regulated internal cycles** best describes this inherent freedom and independence from strict external control.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: በብእዋኑ ዝግበር ህርመታት (Acquired diseases):** Diseases are external factors that can disrupt cycles, not inherent rhythmic processes.
* **C: ስነ-ሂወታዊ ሰዓታት (Biological clocks):** While important, biological clocks are *influenced* by cycles, but they aren't the cycles themselves. The passage talks about rhythms being independent of strict biological clocks.
* **D: ዝተዓዘበ ህርመታት (Disrupted diseases):** Similar to B, disrupted diseases are disruptions *to* cycles, not the cycles themselves.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that aligns with the passage's description of free-flowing, naturally occurring rhythms.

እተፈላለየ ክሱት ባህርያት ዘንጸባርቑ ውልቀ-ሰባት እትገልጽ ቃል አየነይቲ እያ?,"The correct answer is **D: ፖሊይሞርፊክ (Polymorphic)**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** refers to the property of having many forms or variations. The text explicitly states that ""گለሰባት ናይ ሓደ ውሱን ባህሪ ብዙሕ ፍልልያት ዘርእዩ ፖሊሞርፊክ እዮም።"" which translates to ""Individuals of one limited trait have many variations, they are polymorphic.""  This aligns perfectly with the question asking for a word describing entities with diverse characteristics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **ሞኖሞርፊክ (Monomorphic):**  Means having only one form or type. This is the *opposite* of what the question is asking.
* **ተህዋስያን (Heterogeneous):** Means composed of different or dissimilar parts. While related to diversity, it doesn't specifically describe the variety *within* a group based on a single underlying trait like polymorphism does.
* **ጅር (Gir):** This word doesn't have a relevant meaning in this context. It seems to be a typo or an irrelevant option.



"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ነቶም ፍሉይ ቦታ ዝሕዙ ተህዋስያን እትገልጽ ትኽክለኛ ቃል ኣየነይቲ እያ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሞኖሞርፊክ (Monomorphic)**.

Here's why:

* **Monomorphic** refers to a situation where a group has a single, uniform type or characteristic. The passage defines a ""ህዝቢ"" (people/community) as a group with shared characteristics, and ""ሞኖሞርፊክ"" perfectly describes this unified trait.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **ህዝቢ (Hizbi - People/Community):** This is the subject of the definition, not a term describing a characteristic of a group.
* **ጅር (Jir):** This word doesn't have a clear meaning in this context and isn't related to group characteristics.
* **ፖሊይሞርፊክ (Polymorphic):** This describes a situation where a group has *many* different types or characteristics. The passage states that individuals within a ""ህዝቢ"" are polymorphic (diverse), but the *group itself* is described as monomorphic.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብነታት ተፈጥሮ-መሰረት ዝገበረ ንጥፈት ቱሪዝም ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ናብ ቤተ- መዘክር ስነ-ፍልጠት ምብጻሕ (Visiting museums)**.

Here's why:

* **Nature-based tourism** focuses on experiences centered around natural environments and wildlife. 
* **Option C (Visiting museums)** is focused on cultural or historical sites, not primarily on natural elements. The other options directly align with nature-based tourism:
    * **A: ናብ መንጫዕጫዕታ ዝግበር ናይ እግሪ ጉዕዞ (Hiking in the mountains)** involves experiencing natural landscapes.
    * **B: ናይ በረኻ ዕንበባታት ምስኣል (Safari experiences)** is a classic example of wildlife-focused tourism.
    * **D: ፍላይ ፊሺንግ (Fly fishing)** is an activity directly related to natural environments and aquatic life.



Therefore, visiting museums is the only option that doesn't fit the definition of nature-based tourism."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ስርዓት መጓዓዝያ መሰረታዊ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ናይ ውልቀ መካይን (Mechanical vehicle)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ሰብ ብናይ ውልቐ መኪና እዩ ዝጥቀም"" which translates to ""People use mechanical vehicles.""  The passage then goes on to describe how the use of these vehicles contributes to carbon emissions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ስራሕ መዓርፎታት (Work schedules):** While work schedules might influence traffic patterns, the passage's focus is on the *type* of vehicle used.
* **C: ጽኑዕ ባዮስፊየር (Stable biosphere):** The passage argues that the use of mechanical vehicles has *unstable* the biosphere.
* **D: ሰብኣዊ ፍልቀት (Human ingenuity):**  While the development of mechanical vehicles is an example of human ingenuity, the passage isn't primarily discussing ingenuity itself. It's focusing on the *consequences* of using those vehicles.

እቶም ኣብ ኑክልየስ ዝዘውሩ ንጥረ ነገራት ኣየናይ ዓይነት ኤልክትሪካዊ ምልኣት እዩ ዘለዎ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣወንታዊ ኤልክትሪካዊ ምልኣት** (Positive electric charge).

Here's why:

* **Protons** in the nucleus have a **positive** electric charge.
* **Neutrons** have **no** electric charge (they are neutral).
* **Electrons** have a **negative** electric charge.

Since the question asks about the electric charge of the *nucleons* (the particles within the nucleus - protons and neutrons), and protons are positively charged, the correct answer is positive electric charge.
"
እቲ ኑክልየስ ብኣየኖት ዓይነት ንጥረ ነገራት ዝቖመ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D:  ፕሮቶን፡ ኒውትሮን፡ አምኡ’ውን ኤሌክትሮን (Protons, neutrons, and electrons)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ኒዩክለስ ክልተ ነገራት ዘዋሃደ እዩ -ኒዩትሮናትን ፕሮቶናትን (The nucleus is composed of two types of particles - neutrons and protons).""  It then clarifies that electrons are also present around the nucleus.

Therefore, the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons, and electrons orbit the nucleus. Option D is the only choice that reflects this.

Here's why:

* **Binary Numbers:** The passage states that binary numbers use only two digits: 0 and 1.
* **Five Bit Number:**  A five-bit number has five digits.
* **Checking the Options:**
    * **A: 1010** - This is a four-bit number.
    * **B: 12001** - This contains the digit '2', which is not a valid binary digit.
    * **C: 10010** - This is a five-bit number consisting only of 0s and 1s.
    * **D: 110101** - This is a six-bit number.

Therefore, only 10010 is a five-bit binary number."
ክልተኣዊ-ኣሃዝ እንታይ ተባሂሎም እውን ይጽውዑ?,"The correct answer is **A: ቢትስ (Bits)**.

The passage states that binary digits are called ""bits"" in computer jargon.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that blogging helps students **edit their writings** and **improve their writing skills** (option A). It also mentions that blogging allows students to **express their own opinions on specific issues and provide informed responses to online content** (option D). 

However, the text doesn't directly mention the ability to **draw conclusions from the discussion itself** as a benefit of student writing.  While blogging facilitates discussion, the text doesn't highlight drawing conclusions *from* that discussion as a key advantage.

Option C (connecting with the local environment) is mentioned as a way blogging encourages students to learn, but isn't presented as a *primary* advantage of their writing itself.

Therefore, option B is the best answer as it represents a benefit not explicitly stated in the text.

Answering their questions helps students become more inquisitive and mature.""

This directly links blogging to answering student questions, thus fostering curiosity and maturity in their writing skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ኢንተርኔት ንመሳርሒታት ደጋጊምካ ምምላስ (Responding to search engines):** While blogging *can* help with search engine visibility, it's not the primary reason mentioned for improving writing skills.

* **D: ክትተሓጋገዝ ምድላይ (Encouraging collaboration):** While collaboration *can* occur through blogging, the text doesn't highlight it as the central reason for writing skill improvement.

Here's why:

The passage states that the current situation (with the challenges of traditional learning) prevents students from learning at their own pace.  It then highlights the benefits of technology – allowing students to learn at their own speed and enabling quick feedback from instructors.  Therefore, the key advantage *not* mentioned as a benefit of these technologies is the ability for students to learn at their own pace. Options A, B, and C are all benefits explicitly mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

The text states that the traditional educational system is slow in allowing students to ask questions and receive feedback, and that teachers struggle to quickly disseminate information. It also mentions the issue of time-bound schedules.  While the other options are mentioned in the text:

*   **A: ፍጥነት ትምህርቲ (Pace of learning)** - The text explicitly states that students learn at different speeds and the traditional system can't accommodate this.
*   **B: ናይ ስራሕ ሰዓታት (Work hours)** -  The text points out time-bound schedules as a constraint.
*   **D: ኢንተርኔት ምጥቃም (Internet access)** - The text highlights the availability of information and instant communication through the internet and global networks.

The text doesn't directly address the *workload of teachers* as a core reason for the inefficiency of the traditional system. The inefficiency stems more from the *process* of teaching and the constraints of time and communication.

ኣብ ማእከላይ ዘመን ምስ ዝነበሩ ህንጻታት ክተኣሳሰር ይኽእል እዩ ተባሂሉ ኣብቲ ጽሑፍ ዘይተገለጸ እንታይ እዩ?,"The answer is **A: ጎዳጉዲ በዓቲ (Festival processions)**.

Here's why:

The text focuses on the *representations* of medieval festivals and competitions – specifically, the depictions of joy, courtship, and wrestling. It describes details like the music, sounds, and the settings (like the well and the pit of the house of El).

The question asks what *isn't mentioned* in the text.  While the text touches upon aspects *of* festivals, it doesn't discuss the processions themselves. The emphasis is on the symbolic representations *within* the festivals, not the overall organized events like festival processions.

The other options are related to elements that *are* implied or directly mentioned:

* **B: ተዋጋእቲ ሰብ ፈረስ (Wrestler vs. Horseman):** The text specifically mentions wrestling as a competition.
* **C: ዳጌት (Axe):**  The text mentions sounds and settings, so an axe *could* be a possible element within a scene, though not explicitly highlighted.
* **D: ፈረሰኛ (Rider):** The text mentions the ""horseman"" in the wrestling competition.



Therefore, festival processions are the most fitting answer because they are a type of event closely related to festivals, but not specifically discussed in the text.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions that during the medieval festivals (gimbi), one could hear the ringing of bells, the sound of the *shikona* (a type of drum), and the light coming from the well of El. However, it **doesn't mention weddings (digsat)** as something that could be heard or witnessed during these festivals. The text focuses more on the sounds of the rituals and the social aspects of the events rather than specifically mentioning the visual or auditory aspects of weddings.

* **The passage states:** ""እቲ ዜብለጭልጭ መሳዅትን ቀጢን መናድቕን ነቲ ሓያል መጥቃዕቲ ንነዊሕ እዋን ኪጻወሮ ኣይክእልን እዩ ነይሩ ። ብ1480ታት እታ ሃገር ብሎርድ ሃስቲንግስ ህንጸት ክትጅምር ከላ ብተዛማዲ ሰላማዊት ኢያ ነይራ..."" (The delightful sounds and tinkling melodies were such that he couldn't play the powerful attacks for a long time. In the 1480s, the country, under Lord Hastings' reign, was peaceful and had begun to develop... ).  This strongly suggests that King Hastings was involved in commissioning or appreciating the game's sounds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ህንጸት ኣብ ዝግበረሉ ዝነበረ እዋን እታ ሃገር ሰላማዊት ስለ ዝነበረት ብዙሕ ዕርድታት ኣየድልን እዩ ነይሩ** (During the reign he upheld, the country was peaceful, so there weren't many tournaments). While the passage mentions peace, it *doesn't* directly connect the peace to a lack of tournaments.
* **C: ህንጸት ናይቲ ግምቢ ኣብቲ እዋን እቲ ልሙድ ኣይነበረን** (The reign of the game was not a custom during that time). The passage clearly implies the game *was* a custom, as it's described as something played.
* **D: ነዊሕን ቈራጽን መጥቃዕቲታት ንምጽዋር እዩ ተሃኒጹ** (Powerful and intricate attacks were developed for entertainment). While the passage mentions powerful attacks, it doesn't say they were specifically *developed* for entertainment. It focuses on the sounds being overwhelming.

Here's why:

* The text states that in the time of Kirby Muxlo, the country was ruled by Lord Hastings and was focused on peaceful governance and defense against invaders. It *specifically* mentions that the country had **steady growth** (ቀጠንቲ መናድቕ) and was not known for frequent battles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዓበይቲ መሳኹቲ (Great Battles)** - The text explicitly states the opposite:  the country *didn't* engage in frequent battles.
* **B: መጥቃዕቲታት ንምጽዋር ተባሂሉ ዝህነጽ መሰረት (A Foundation built on Wars/Conquests)** - The text says the country was founded on peaceful governance, not conquest.
* **C: ካብ ቁሩባት ግምቢታት ውሑዳት ድፋዓት (Rare Conflicts from Neighboring Kingdoms)** - While the text mentions defense against invaders, it doesn't say conflicts were *rare* - only that the country wasn't frequently fighting *within* its own borders or against neighbors.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that a good swimmer needs to maintain a strong core throughout the entire swim. It specifically mentions needing to be able to swim in two minutes and having consistent core strength. 

Option C, a three-minute plank, directly relates to core strength and endurance.  A plank is a core-strengthening exercise. While the other options might be beneficial for overall fitness, they don't directly address the consistent core strength needed for swimming as highlighted in the text.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: "" ኣብ ክልተ ደቒቓ ክውድእ ዝኽእል እኹል ፍጥነት ክህልዎ ኣልዎ"" which translates to ""It must have a speed that can be covered in under two minutes.""  This is highlighted as a crucial requirement for the rower. The other options are not mentioned as critical aspects in the text.

ንሓደ ኣትሌት፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ብኣመጋግባ ጥራይ ክብጻሕ ዘይከኣል ኣየናይ ኢዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: እተመሓየሸ ብቕዓት (Etemehayeshe bq'at - Untrained/Unskilled)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that genuine teamwork alone isn't enough for success. It emphasizes the impact of *superior individual athletic skills*. The text highlights that good technique, efficient movement, and the development of individual skills are crucial for athletes to succeed and maintain their passion for the sport.

Option A, ""እተመሓየሸ ብቕዓት,"" directly refers to a lack of skill.  The passage implies that lacking individual skill is a significant obstacle to success, even with good teamwork.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: ዝያዳ ሓጎስ (Ziyada hagos - Great enthusiasm):** Enthusiasm is positive, but the passage frames it as something that *benefits* from strong underlying skills, not a substitute for them.
*   **C: ዝለዓለ ብቕዓት (Zle'ale bq'at - Increased skill):** Increased skill is *exactly* what the passage emphasizes as important.
*   **D: ሓፈሻዊ ጥዕና (Hafesawi t'e'na - Holistic care/training):** Holistic training includes skill development, so this is also something the passage highlights as important.

Here's why:

The passage states that while proper training alone isn't enough, advanced nutritional practices have a significant impact on athletes. It then goes on to mention specific examples of nutritional practices like proper hydration, fluid intake, and creating replacement routines.  The core idea is that *proper nutrition* is a key way athletes can enhance their enjoyment of sports and maintain their passion for them.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: ብቐጻልነት ብዝለዓለ ደረጃ ምስራሕ (Regularly increasing intensity):** While important for progress, the passage doesn't explicitly link *regularly increasing intensity* to increased enjoyment. It focuses more on the *practices* of nutrition and hydration.
* **C: ብትኽክል ማይ ምስታይ (Proper hydration):**  Proper hydration is mentioned *as an example* of a good practice, but not the central way athletes find more joy in sports. The passage highlights a broader range of nutritional practices.
* **D: ጥዑይ ሓይሊ ሚዛን ምዕቃብ (Excessive strength imbalance):** This is presented as a negative, not a way to find more joy in sports. It's linked to potential injuries and hindering performance.



Therefore, **proper nutrition (ግቡእ ኣመጋግባ ምልምማድ)** is the most accurate answer based on the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ኣትሌታት ረብሓ ዋላ እንተዘይሃለዎ ምህርቲ ዘድልዮም ኮይኑ ይስመዖም እዩ"" which translates to ""Athletes are heard to have achieved good results if they have proven records.""

This directly implies that having proven records (ረብሓታት ዝተረጋገፁ) is what makes a middle-distance runner more respected and valued.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ውልቃዊ ምርጭኦም እዩ (Their physical attributes):** The passage doesn't specifically mention physical attributes as the reason for respect.
*   **C: ንብቕዓቶም ብዓብይኡ ክጸልዎ እዩ (Their dedication to their training):** While dedication is important, the passage emphasizes the *results* of that dedication – the proven records.
*   **D: ብዛዕባ እቲ ኽቡር ዘይኰነ መሳርሒታት ግጉይ ርድኢት ኣሎ (There is a keen insight about the less respected results):** This option is not supported by the text. The text focuses on the positive recognition gained through good results.

The text explicitly states: ""ቈጸረ ዘድልዩ ውሑድ መሳርሒታት ብዛዕባ ብዙሕ ዝተጋገዩ ኣመለካክታ ኣለዉ"" which translates to ""There are many beliefs about long-distance running being a sport with limited sponsors."" The text further implies that a runner needs sponsors to be successful, stating ""ኣትሌታት ረብሓ ዋላ እንተዘይሃለዎ ምህርቲ ዘድልዮም ኮይኑ ይስመዖም እዩ,"" meaning ""Athletes who don't have sponsors are said to have difficulty in training.""

Therefore, the answer is A.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ሓደ ካብ'ዞም ክእለታት ዝኾነ ናይ ካልኦት ዕላማ ምርዳእ ኣገዳሲ እዩ"" which translates to ""One of these abilities is the ability to understand the goals of others is essential.""  

The passage explains that understanding others' goals helps us predict their actions. The example of seeing someone looking at a car window and assuming they want to steal it highlights this point – we're inferring their *goal* (to steal the car) based on their *action* (looking at the car window).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ድልየት (Inference):** While inference is *used* to understand goals, the passage emphasizes that understanding the goal itself is the crucial element.
* **C: እምነት (Belief):** The passage mentions beliefs as something we can easily guess about others, but it doesn't say it's the primary goal we try to understand.
* **D: ግንዛበ (Knowledge):**  Knowledge is too broad. The passage focuses on understanding *intent* or *goals*, not just general knowledge.

Here's why:

The passage states that people with this ability can easily guess what others are thinking, feeling, believing, knowing, or desiring. This is directly related to ""ብዛዕባ ዕላማ ምፍላጥ ሰባት እንታይ ክገብሩ ይሕግዞም"" (what they guess about the goals of others). Option D accurately reflects this ability of mind-reading or mind-guessing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ነቲ ብድሕሪ ኣካላዊ ምንቅስቓስ ዘሎ ምጥርጣር የወግዱ (They prefer to guess after physical actions):** The passage emphasizes *easily* guessing *before* physical actions, not after.
*   **B: ድልየታት ይግምቱ (They predict desires):** While related, the passage speaks to a broader ability to understand the other person's mental state, not just their desires.
*   **C: ንኻልኦት ሰባት ብዘይ ፍርዲ ይርእዩ (They look at other people without discrimination):** The passage describes a focused ability to understand *specific* individuals, not a general lack of discrimination.

Here's why:

The text states: "" ኣብነታት ቁጽጽር፣ መደብን ውጥንን، ናይ ዓመዊል ጸገማትን ሕቶታትን ናይ ምምላስ ክእለት ከምኡ'ውን ምልላይ ጽሕፈት ኢድ፣ ድምጽን ገጽን ይጠቃልም። እዚ ንጹር ትምህርቲ ኮይኑ ኣሎ ፣ እዚ ንሓቀኛ ናይ ሂወት መሰናኽላት መፍትሒ ምሃብ ኣብልዕሊ ዘተኮረ እዩ.""

Translation: ""It has the ability to answer questions of quantity, category and combination, as well as to transcribe handwriting, recognize voice and text. This pure learning focuses on providing solutions to fundamental human needs.""

The text emphasizes solving fundamental human needs and providing solutions, which is closely related to automating tasks. While the text mentions capabilities like voice recognition and text transcription, these are *means* to achieving the broader goal of automating various types of work and solving problems.

The other options are not the overarching goal mentioned in the text:

*   **A: መደብ ምውጻእ (Character recognition):**  A specific capability of AI, not the primary goal.
*   **B: ድምጺ ምልላይ (Voice recognition):** A specific capability of AI, not the primary goal.
*   **C: ግዜ ምምዳብ (Time management):** While AI *can* assist with time management, the text's focus is broader than just this aspect.

Therefore, **automation of work** best encapsulates the central aim of artificial intelligence as presented in the passage."

Here's why:

The text states that AI has the ability to ""interpret text, voice, and images"" and to ""solve numerical, categorical, and logical problems.""  It specifically mentions capabilities like ""pattern recognition and time scheduling"" as examples of what AI can do.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ኣገልግሎት ዓሚል (Service agent):** While AI *can* be used as a service agent, the text doesn't emphasize this as the primary area of its focus.
* **C: ስነ-ፍልጠታዊ ልበ-ወለድ (Abstract emotionality):**  The text focuses on logical and problem-solving capabilities, not emotional ones.
* **D: ናይ ኢድ ጽሕፈት ምልላይ (Handwriting recognition):** Handwriting recognition is mentioned as *one* example of what AI can do, but it doesn't represent the overall breadth of AI's capabilities as well as pattern recognition and time scheduling.

Here's why:

The text states that a good, diverse thinking process leads to **one definitive answer**. It contrasts this with thinking that produces only two answers – either correct or incorrect.  

Option A directly contradicts this.  It describes a thinking process that generates *many* correct solutions.  This is the opposite of the focused, definitive outcome described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ንሓደ ጸገም ሓድሽ ሜላታት ኣብ ግብሪ ምውዓል (Introducing new dimensions to a problem)** - This is a positive aspect of thinking, but not necessarily a characteristic of a *diverse* thinking process that arrives at a definitive answer.
* **C: ግዜ ወሲዶም ጸገማት ይፈትሑ (Problems are solved over time)** -  This is a general statement about problem-solving, not directly related to the characteristics of diverse thinking.
* **D: ኣገባባት ምዝካር (Memorizing patterns)** - While pattern recognition is a part of thinking, the text emphasizes diversity and generating multiple solutions, not just memorizing existing patterns.



Therefore, option A is the only one that describes a thinking process *different* from the one described in the text, which emphasizes a singular, definitive answer."

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ናይዚ ኣተሓሳሰባ ብጣዕሚ ኣድላይ ነገር-ሓደ ሓቀኛ መልሲ ሓደ ጥራይ እዩ"" (This kind of thinking is extremely beneficial - only one definite answer is enough).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ግዜ ምውሳድ (Time management):** While important, time management isn't the *core* focus of the passage's description of a particular type of thinking.
* **C: ጭብጢታት ምፍላይ (Detail-oriented):**  The passage mentions paying attention to information (ሓበሬታ ምእካብ), but it's not primarily about being detail-oriented.
* **D: ሓበሬታታት ምእካብ (Gathering information):** Gathering information is part of the thinking process, but it's the *finding of a single correct answer* that's the defining characteristic emphasized in the passage.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ንንእሽቶ ኣገላልጻ ኣብ ግምት ዘየእቱ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: እንዳተዛረብካ ከለኻ ናብ ካልእ ምጥማት (Disrupting your conversation)**.

Here's why:

The text describes micro-expressions as fleeting facial expressions that reveal true emotions. It mentions Oliver Sacks' observation of people with a condition preventing them from expressing joy verbally, but who could still convey their emotions through these micro-expressions.  This implies micro-expressions are about subtle, often unconscious, emotional communication.

Option A, ""Genda terzerebka kelekkha nab kal'e mitmat"" (Disrupting your conversation), is the most related because micro-expressions can reveal hidden emotions that might contradict what someone is saying, potentially disrupting the flow of a conversation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: ግንባርካ ምጽዋግ (Backpatting)** - This is a physical action and not directly related to facial expressions or subtle emotional communication.
*   **C: ብፍጥነት ቋሕ ሰም ምባል (Speaking very quickly)** -  While speed of speech can indicate emotion, it's not the same as the subtle, fleeting expressions described.
*   **D: በኣጻብዕትኻ ጽቡቕ ምባል (Being good at your work)** - This is about competence and skill, not related to emotional expressions.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the interpretation of facial expressions and emotional states.** It discusses how micro-expressions can reveal hidden emotions, even when someone is trying to conceal them.
* **Option A (""Pre-recorded videos bring great confusion."") is irrelevant to the passage's core topic.** The passage isn't discussing pre-recorded videos or the confusion they might cause.  It's about *interpreting* live expressions.
* **Options B, C, and D align with the passage:**
    * **B (Accurate interpretation can be subjective):** The passage implies that interpreting emotions isn't always straightforward and can involve personal biases.
    * **C (Interprets both verbal speech and written descriptions):** The passage mentions that interpreting emotions goes beyond just words; it encompasses expressions and other cues.
    * **D (Congruence can help in judging emotions):**  The passage implies that a match between verbal and non-verbal cues can contribute to accurate emotional assessment.



Therefore, option A is the one that doesn't fit the context of the provided passage.

ብውጽኢት ተሃድሶ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ዝያዳ ኣገዳሲ ዝኾነ? ,"The correct answer is **B: ፍልጠት ምዝውዋር (The accumulation of knowledge)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the increasing accumulation of knowledge (ፍልጠት ዝርከበሉ መጠን) led to a significant change in learning and understanding. The core idea is that *more knowledge* is the driving force behind the positive evolution.

Let's look at why the other options are less central:

* **A: ናይ ውልቀ-ሰብ ተዘክሮ (Memory of the collective):** While important, the passage emphasizes the *quantity* of knowledge, not just remembering what others have done.
* **C: ናይ ጽሑፍ ተዘክሮ (Memory of writing):**  The passage mentions the shift from oral tradition to written texts, but the key isn't the memory of the writing itself, but the *information* conveyed through it.
* **D: ሓበሬታ ምርካብ (Information processing):**  Information processing is a *result* of having knowledge, but the passage focuses on the foundational shift in the *amount* of knowledge available.

Therefore, the passage highlights **the accumulation of knowledge** as the most significant factor in the described evolution.



"

The passage explicitly states: ""ፍልጠት ናይ ምርካብን ናይ ምምሃርን ዓቕሚ ልዕል ኢሉ ከም ዝተገለፀ ስለዝተቐየረ ፍልጠት ዝርከበሉ መጠን ተቐይሩ እዩ。""  This translates to: ""Because knowledge was portrayed as the importance and capacity of learning, the extent of knowledge has changed.""

The passage goes on to describe how the role of information changed, emphasizing that while oral tradition was fading, written messages held more weight.  This shift highlights the increasing importance placed on knowledge, specifically *written* knowledge, in learning and communication.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ናይ ውልቀ-ሰብ ተዘክሮ (Oral Tradition):** The passage explicitly mentions the decline of oral tradition, not its importance.
* **C: ናይ ጽሑፍ ተዘክሮ (Written Tradition):** While the passage mentions the rise of written messages, it's not the core theme of the shift in importance. It's *because* of the written tradition that the importance of knowledge increased.
* **D: ምዝርጋሕ ሓበሬታ (Dissemination of Information):**  The passage speaks about the *nature* of information (moving from oral to written) and how it affected learning, but not about the dissemination itself.



Therefore, **B: ፍልጠት ምርካብ (Importance of Knowledge)** best captures the main point of the passage regarding the transformation in learning and communication.

Here's why:

The passage highlights that the internet facilitates ongoing connections and supports moral development through knowledge sharing and social interaction. 

* **A: መራኸቢ ንግዲ (Communication/Messaging):** This directly involves ongoing interaction with others.
* **B: ምስ ስድራ ቤትካ ምርኻብ (Connecting with family):** This is a common form of maintaining ongoing relationships.

* **C: ጕዕዞ ምርምር ምግባር (Travel research):** While the internet *can* be used for travel research, it doesn't inherently involve ongoing interaction or relationship building. It's a task that can be completed without necessarily creating or maintaining connections with others.



Therefore, travel research is the activity least likely to be performed with the intention of fostering ongoing connections or moral development in the way the passage describes."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ንውልቃዊ ተሳትፎ ኢንተርነት ንትኽጥቀም ዘይድርኽ መነቓቕሒ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ገንዘብ ምቍጽጻር (Financial transactions)**.

Here's why:

The provided text focuses on how the internet facilitates and enhances **social** interaction and connection. It highlights how the internet helps to spread knowledge and build relationships, positively influencing morality. The examples given (information dissemination, social interaction) are all related to social aspects.

Financial transactions, while possible online, are primarily a **transactional** activity. They don't inherently foster social connection or interaction in the same way that online discussions, information sharing, or building relationships do.  The other options (looking at recipes, participating in online forums, researching health) all involve some degree of social interaction or information exchange, aligning with the text's emphasis on social connectivity.

Therefore, financial transactions are the activity least directly related to the social benefits of internet use as described in the passage.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ንኣከባብያዊ ጉዳያት ክዓቢ ዝኽእል ነባሪ ፍታሕ ከም ዝዀነ ጌርካ ዝርአ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: እተጋነነ ምርጫታት ኣነባብራ ምቍጽጻር (Integrated development)**.

Here's why:

The text states that while scientific and technological advancements are important, tackling environmental problems requires more than just scientific research. It emphasizes the need to address the *root causes* of the problems, which are linked to population growth, consumption patterns, and societal structures.  ""እተጋነነ ምርጫታት ኣነባብራ ምቍጽጻር"" (Integrated development) best captures this idea of addressing the interconnected and complex factors driving environmental issues through a holistic and planned approach.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: ንጥፈታት ማሕበራዊ መራኸቢታት (Social media trends):** While social media can raise awareness, it's not a core solution to environmental problems.
* **C: ጠንቂ እቲ ጉዳያት ምልላይ (Simplification of the issues):** The text explicitly states that environmental problems are not easily solved with simple research.
* **D: ተሓባባሪ ምንቅስቓስ ኣከባቢ ምዃን (Collaborative environmental movements):**  While important, collaboration is a *part* of the solution, not the overarching approach highlighted in the text.

Therefore, **Integrated development (እተጋነነ ምርጫታት ኣነባብራ ምቍጽጻር)** most accurately reflects the text's message about needing a comprehensive and interconnected approach to environmental issues beyond just scientific research."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መፍትሒታት ንኣከባብያዊ ጉዳያት ከም ምልክት ሕክምና ጌርካ ዘይርአ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ቀንዲ ጠንቂ እቲ ጉዳያት ምጥፋእ (The key is to eliminate the root causes of the problems.)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ግን ከኣ ግዝያዊ ፍታሕ ጥራሕ እንተዘይደሊና፣ ሱር ናይ ኩሉ ጸገማት ረኺብና ካብ ስራሕ ወጻኢ ክንገብሮም ኣለና። ወድሰብ ብሳይንሳዊ ከምኡውን ብቴክኖሎጂ ዕቤት ምኽንያት ዓለም ብዙሕ ለዉጢ ኣምጺኣ እያ ፣ ከምኡውን ምስ ሰብ በዝሒ ከምኡውን ሰብ ብኹን ኣነባብራ መንገዲ ምኽንያት መሰናኽላት እና ወስኽ መጺኡ`ሎ。"" (But if we don't focus on the root causes, we will find that all the problems arise from outside our work. The world is changing greatly due to science and technology, as well as the increasing population and the way people are developing, acquiring amenities.)

This indicates that simply treating the symptoms (like a "" ምልክት ሕክምና"" - a symptom treatment) is insufficient.  Addressing the underlying causes is what's truly needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ንጥፈታት ማሕበራዊ መራኸቢታት ምስታፍ (Focusing on the shortcomings of social media):**  While social media might be *part* of the problem, the text is broader than just social media.
* **C: ብዛዕባ እተጋነነ ኣነባብራ ርእይቶታት ምሃብ (Providing insights about exaggerated development):**  This is related to the root causes, but not the *key* to eliminating them.
* **D: ኣከባብያዊ ምሹእ ዝኾነ ናብራ ምንባር (A sustainable development path that is relevant to the environment):** This is a goal, not the *key* solution to the problems.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the text's message."

The text explicitly states: ""ስለዚ እዚ ናይ ሰላሳ ዓመት ጦርነት ናይ መወዳእታ ሃይማኖታዊ ውግእ ተባሂሉ ተመግቡ"" which translates to ""Therefore, this Thirty Years' War was called the last religious war.""

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መዳያት ናይ ካቶሊካዊት ቤተ-ክርስትያን ብጥንቃቐ ዘይተመርመረ ጉዳይ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ምክፍፋል ሃብቲ ኣብ ውሽጢ እቲ ቤተ-ክርስትያን ግቡእ እንተድኣ ነይሩ (The accumulation of wealth within the Church was appropriate)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Church's accumulation of wealth was a key area of scrutiny. It highlights the Church's belief in charitable works stemming from wealth and the significant amount of wealth it controlled. The question asks which aspect wasn't thoroughly examined. Since the text emphasizes the scrutiny of wealth accumulation, the statement that it was appropriate is the one that would *not* be thoroughly examined – it's the very thing being questioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ቀንዲ ሰረተ-ሓሳባት ሃይማኖት ይመሓየሹ እንተድኣ ነይሮም (Key religious ideas were examined)** - The text states that charity was a key religious idea driving the Church's wealth accumulation.
* **C: ኣብ ውሽጢ እቲ ቤተ-ክርስትያን ዝነበረ ማእከል ስልጣን (The central role of power within the Church)** - The text mentions the Church's long-standing political and power position.
* **D: ቀንዲ ሰረተ-እምነት ናይቲ ቤተ-ክርስትያን ይማላእ እንተድኣ ነይሩ (Key tenets of the Church's faith were examined)** - The text implies that the Church's core beliefs were important, as they motivated the charitable actions.

The text states: ""ሓደ እዋን ሓደ ኣባል እቶም ጭፍራ ንርእሲ ሓደ ኣብ ቨርሳይል እተቐትለ ሓላዊ ንጉስ ኣብ ቅድሚ እታ ዝፈርሀት ንግስቲ እናወዛወዘ ኣወዛወዞ።"" which translates to: ""At one point, one member of the mob killed a royal chief in Versailles while parading him in front of the frightened queen.""

Therefore, the mob member killed a royal chief, not the king himself (option B), or one of the ladies of the court (option A), or a royal (option D).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The royal family was forced to leave Versailles by a mob, and they were subjected to harassment and threats during their journey to Paris.
* **Option B directly reflects this forced departure.** The other options describe actions *done to* the royal family by the mob, not actions they took *without* mob interference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: መስኰት ሰረገላኦም ኪኽፈት ከሎ (When their carriages were attacked):** This is a direct consequence of the mob's actions.
* **C: ርእሱ እተሰየፈ ሓለዋ ምርኣይ (Seeing the head of a beheaded royal guard):** This was a horrifying event experienced during the journey *because* of the mob's brutality.
* **D: ናብ ፓሪስ ንምምላስ እተገብረ ጉዕዞ (The journey intended to go to Paris):** While the journey was *intended* to go to Paris, the passage emphasizes that it was *forced* and marked by mob interference.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite existing international law concerning the acceptance of the conflict, Britain's strategy of naval blockade didn't yield the desired results. The passage further mentions Germany's intent to retaliate with unrestricted submarine warfare because Britain wasn't respecting the maritime boundaries. This indicates that the conflict *did* influence and ultimately lead to changes in the existing international law regarding warfare, particularly concerning submarine warfare and maritime boundaries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጀርመን ተመሳሳሊ ሜላታት ውግእ ክትጥቀም ዝነበራ ድሌት (Germany's right to use similar naval tactics):**  The passage implies Germany *wanted* to use similar tactics, but it wasn't presented as a pre-existing ""right."" It was a response to Britain's blockade.
* **B: ዘይተሳተፋ መራኽብ ኣብ ጉድኣት ኣተዋ (Neutral shipping in danger):** While neutral shipping *was* in danger, this is a consequence of the conflict, not a direct *result* of the conflict *itself* in terms of legal changes.
* **D: ወሰንቲ ኣቕሑ ብቐሊሉ ክርከቡ ኣይኽእሉን ነይሮም (Shipping could not easily navigate the boundaries):**  This is a consequence of the blockade and the escalation of the conflict, but not the *direct* result of the conflict leading to legal changes.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ብሪጣንያ ንጀርመን ካብ ባሕሪ ኸልከልቲ እዚ ዕንቅፋት እዚ በቲ ኣብ ዝሓለፈ ኽልተ ዘመን እተገብረ እተፈላለየ ኣህጉራዊ ውዕላት እተኣታተወ ሓፈሻዊ ተቐባልነት ዘለዎ ኣህጉራዊ ሕጊ ዝጥሕስ እኳ እንተ ነበረ እቲ ስትራተጂ ግን ውጽኢታዊ ዀይኑ ተረኺቡ ኢዩ。"" (Britain's blockade against Germany, despite being framed within international law that had gained customary acceptance through various international conferences held in the last two decades, was contradictory to it.)

This directly indicates that Britain's blockade violated international law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጀርመን ናይ ሳብማሪን ውግእ ክተካይድ ኣለዓዒሉዋ** (Germany's decision to initiate submarine warfare): While Germany *did* initiate submarine warfare, the passage focuses on the *blockade* as the problematic element.
* **C: ንዋሕዚ ቀረባት ኣቕሑ ጀርመን ኣቋረጾ** (Neutral countries stopped their trade): The passage mentions the danger to neutral shipping, but it doesn't say that neutral countries *stopped* their trade.
* **D: ገለልተኛታት መራኽብ ኣብ ሓደጋ ኸም ዘይኣትዋ ዘረጋግጽ ነበረ** (It was as if neutral shipping was not protected from danger):  The passage highlights the danger to neutral shipping, but it doesn't directly state that it *wasn't* protected.

This translates to: ""MS is a disease affecting the central nervous system, which can affect vision and movement. Studies have shown that the likelihood of MS is twice as high in women compared to men.""

Therefore, a 32-year-old woman is more likely to be affected by MS than a man of the same age.

The text states that ""ከም ምምላስ ዝበሉ ምልክታት ቑልጡፍ ምርመራ ክግበረሉ ዘይኽእል እኹል ምልክት እዩ"" which translates to ""Symptoms like vomiting are a serious symptom that cannot be ignored and requires immediate investigation."" It also mentions that this symptom could be a sign of internal bleeding, poisoning, or poison in the stomach.

Option C, ""ምጭባጥን ከቢድ ቃንዛ ከስዐን"" (Vomiting and severe diarrhea), aligns with the text's description of vomiting as a serious symptom requiring investigation.  The other options don't fit the description of the text regarding internal bleeding, poisoning, or serious internal issues.

The text states: ""ነቲ ግዳይ ንምምርማር፣ ድሕነትካ ንምርግጋጽ ፈለማ ነቲ ቦታ ፍጻመ ክትምርሮ ኣሎካ"" which translates to ""To investigate the crime, to ensure your safety, you should first examine the scene."" Therefore, examining the scene is the first priority.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the need for careful planning and thorough investigation before acting. It states that the place being investigated should be assessed *before* anyone (the user, anyone) automatically approaches it.  It also mentions that if you are injured, you should assess the situation and react accordingly.

Option A contradicts this cautious approach.  It suggests not being afraid of your own mistakes, which implies a lack of concern for potential errors and a disregard for the need to be prepared and careful. The text stresses the importance of *avoiding* mistakes through proper investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are relevant:

* **B: ቅድሚ እቲ ግዳይ ነቲ ስፍራ ገምግሞ (Assess the area before the mission):** This aligns perfectly with the text's emphasis on preliminary investigation.
* **C: ኣቃውማ ናይቲ ግዳይ ተዓዘብ (Assemble the mission team):**  While not directly stated, assembling a team implies planning and coordination, which is consistent with the passage's message.
* **D: ዝዀነ ይኹን ቀይሕ ባንዴራ እንተልዩ ኸተስተብህለሉ ፈትን (Regardless of the color, check for a red flag):** This is directly in line with the text's instruction to look for and assess any potential dangers (""red flag"").



Therefore, Option A is the only one that doesn't reflect the cautious and investigative approach advocated in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states that the French revolution, while initially focused on the *sans-culottes* (working class), also affected the *seigneurs* (nobility) and those in the military. The key point is that the revolution shifted focus *away* from the direct issues of the *sans-culottes* and towards broader societal changes, including the new concept of the nation as a unified people and the idea of popular sovereignty.

Option B reflects this shift in focus. The revolution's attention moved *from* the Derby (which likely represents the initial concerns of the working class, like economic hardship and immediate political demands) *to* the broader competition for power and influence within French society.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ነታ ሃገር ዝግበር ደገፍ ወሲኹ (Providing support to the country):** While the revolution involved supporting the country, this isn't the *primary* or *most significant* consequence mentioned in the passage regarding the impact on the *sans-culottes*.
* **C: ስነ-ሓሳብ ኣባል ሰልፊ ሪፓብሊክ ተቐባልነት ረኸበ (The idea of republican participation gained acceptance):**  The passage *implies* this as a consequence, but the shift in focus is a more direct and immediate effect.
* **D: ሓድሽ ኣገባብ መለክዒ (New messaging approach):** While new messaging likely emerged, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as a major impact.

The text states that the French rallied many ""skilled and unemployed people"" to the cause. It also mentions that even those in the military were recruited based on their work experience rather than military qualifications. This indicates that work experience was a key factor in the French call to arms.

Here's why:

The question asks about the reasons behind the failures of public administration in developed countries, despite their advanced infrastructure.  The text highlights the use of hierarchical structures (""ናይ መጎዓዝያ ኣገባባ"" - hierarchical structure) and bureaucratic processes (""ጥርዓን ይቕርብ"" - they follow procedures). The question then directly asks about the cause of their daily decline. 

Option C, ""ህዝባዊ መጓዓዝያ"" (Public Administration), is the most direct and relevant answer because the entire passage is about the problems *within* public administration.  The other options are tangentially related but not the core issue being discussed.

* **A: ጽሬት ማይ (Water Scarcity):** While water scarcity is a problem in some places, it's not the central cause of the issues in public administration discussed in the passage.
* **B: ህንጸት ቢንቶ (Strong Women):**  The strength of women is a societal factor, but the passage focuses on organizational and bureaucratic problems.
* **D: ትምህርቲ (Education):** Education is important, but the passage doesn't suggest a lack of education is the primary reason for the decline of public administration.

Therefore, the passage is directly questioning the effectiveness and reasons for the failures *of public administration* in developed nations.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ብዛዕባ ስርዓት ህዝባዊ መጓዓዝያ እንታይ ክብሃል ይኽእል?,"The correct answer is **A: ብኹሉ እቲ ዝጥቀመሉ ሰብ ኣጸቢቖም ይፍተዉ እዮም (All who use it face criticism.)**

Here's why:

The passage states that in developed countries, there's criticism surrounding the construction of dams and bridges. It then poses the question of *why* these systems, despite their intention to help, often face failure and decline. The core of the question implies that there's a negative consequence associated with using these systems, and the answer ""All who use it face criticism"" best reflects that negative consequence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ማዕረ ጽሬት ማይ ሕማቓት ኣይኰኑን (The source of trust is not water.)** - The passage doesn't discuss the source of trust, only the criticism.
* **C: ብተጠቀምቲ ብዙሕ መረረት ንኽህሉ ምኽንያት ይኾኑ (They are caused by using too many resources.)** - While resource management *could* be a factor in the failure of these systems, the passage doesn't explicitly say this. It focuses on the criticism faced by those who *use* the systems.
* **D: ኣብ ኣብዛሓ ዝማዕበላ ሃገራት ናጻ እዮም (They are free in developed countries.)** - The passage explicitly states criticism *in* developed countries, not that these systems are ""free"" in any sense.  The criticism indicates a constraint or problem, not freedom.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the information presented in the passage."

Here's why:

The text states that ""ዋሕዚ ትራፊክ ንምንቅስቃስ ነፍስወከፍ መራሕቲ መኪናን መካይንን ኣብ መንጎ ክልተ ነጥብታት ከምኡ'ውን ኣብ መንግኦም ዝካየድ ምጽልላውን ዘጽንዕ ዓውዲ እዩ"" which translates to ""Wave traffic is a field that studies the propagation of waves for the control of autonomous vehicles between two points and in the ground.""

The text further explains that wave traffic offers a certain level of fairness and perfection, and can even be calculated probabilistically.  The three key properties of wave traffic are: (1) wave, (2) slant, and (3) river. These elements regulate the interaction between roads, work, and the movement of railway trains.

Because wave propagation is the fundamental element of wave traffic and allows for the control and regulation of vehicles, its failure would be the most detrimental. The other options (wave propagation, slant, and work) are *components* of wave traffic, but wave *propagation* itself is the underlying process that enables it.

Therefore, the inability of autonomous vehicles to utilize wave propagation would be the most damaging consequence.

The passage states that ""ዋሕዚ ትራፊክ ንምንቅስቃስ ነፍስወከፍ መራሕቲ መኪናን መካይንን ኣብ መንጎ ክልተ ነጥብታት ከምኡ'ውን ኣብ መንግኦም ዝካየድ ምጽልላውን ዘጽንዕ ዓውዲ እዩ"" (Wazy traffic is a field that studies the control of vehicle and pedestrian movement between two points and ground-based movement). It also highlights that Wazy traffic provides a certain degree of fairness and completeness, and can be simulated with statistical calculations.

The passage further mentions that Wazy traffic is based on three key characteristics: Wazy (likely referring to the system itself), **ጻዕቒ (predictability)**, and **ናህሪ (fluidity)**.  The passage emphasizes that these characteristics are crucial for traffic in terms of flow, work, and the movement of railway trains.

Therefore, traffic light operations (ናይ ጽርጊያ ስራሕቲ) directly relate to the control, predictability, and fluidity of traffic flow. The other options, while potentially relevant, are not as central to the passage's emphasis on the key characteristics of Wazy traffic. The passage uses the other options to build up the context of what Wazy traffic is.

Therefore, radioactive sulfur was used to identify the DNA."

Here's why:

The passage states that mutations can have different outcomes:

*   In germline mutations (passed to offspring), the mutation's effect is limited to the offspring.
*   In somatic mutations (occurring in body cells), the mutation can lead to cell death or cancer.

Therefore, the ability to cause cell death (or potentially cancer) is a key factor determining if a mutation is passed on to future generations.  Options A, B, and C are not the primary determinants of whether a mutation is passed on.  The passage focuses on the outcome of the mutation within the individual's cells.

Here's why:

The passage states that mutations have different types of heritability. Some mutations are *only* passed on to offspring within germ cells (sperm and eggs). Others can lead to cell death or cancer.  Therefore, the key difference highlighted is *how* the mutations are passed down - whether they are heritable or not.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቲ ዘርኣዊ መሳርሒ ክንደይ ዝኣክል እዩ ተጎዲኡ (How much the germline is damaged):** The passage doesn't discuss the *extent* of germline damage, only the different outcomes of mutations affecting the germline.
*   **B: እቶም ዝተጎድኡ ዋህዮታት ደቀቕቲ ታህዋስያን እንተኾይኖም (The mutated genes are not proto-oncogenes):** The passage explicitly states that mutations *are* proto-oncogenes.
*   **D: ዓይነት ናይቲ ዝተጸልወ ምልዋጥ (The type of mutation that occurred):** While the passage mentions different types of heritability, it doesn't focus on the *type* of mutation itself. It focuses on the outcome (heritability vs. not).

Here's why:

The passage states that early humans started domesticating dogs *to obtain their fur, meat, skin, and bones*.  It specifically mentions they began to value the dog's coat, hair, flesh, and bones. Therefore, the primary reason for domesticating dogs, according to the text, was to obtain their fur (ጸባ).

The text states: "" ኣብልዕሊ ስሩዕ ዙርያ እዋን ዓሰርተ ሸሞንተ ሃጓፋት ይጻወቱ"" which translates to ""They play over a course of eighteen holes"".  The question asks where a golfer walks in a golf course. The 18th hole is the final hole, and golfers walk *to* and *through* it.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እዚ ሜላ እዙይ ድማ ንመብዛሕትኦም ናይንሳዊ ምርምራት ከምመምርሒ ዘገልግል እዩ። ንበይኑ'ኳ ኣይኮነን፣ ፈተነ ከምኡ'ውን ፈተናዊ መጽናዕቲ ማለት ዝቐረበ ሓደ ወይ ልዕሊኡ ግምታዊ ሓሳብ ንምስራዝ..."" which translates to: ""This method also serves as a guide for most scientific research. However, it is not just about experimentation and exploratory study, but about formulating one or more speculative ideas...""

Therefore, the core purpose of the scientific method, as described, is to develop speculative ideas. While the other options are related to the scientific process, they are not the *primary* goal emphasized in the passage."

Here's why:

The text states that scientific inquiry involves ""one or more tentative or speculative ideas"" as a starting point.  It also mentions ""testing"" and ""experimental study"" as a result of this process.  Therefore, formulating hypothetical ideas is a *core component* of scientific inquiry.

The question asks what is *not* included in scientific inquiry based on the text.  The options are:

*   **A: ስነ-ፍልጠታዊ ሜላ በይኑ (The scientific method itself):** The text says scientific inquiry *uses* the scientific method.
*   **B: ትዕዝብቲታት ምግባር (Conducting experiments):** The text mentions experimentation as a consequence of scientific inquiry.
*   **C: ግምታዊ ሓሳባት ምውጋድ (Formulating hypothetical ideas):** This is explicitly stated as a crucial starting point.
*   **D: ፈተነታት ምክያድ (Testing hypotheses):** This is also mentioned as a key element.

Therefore, the only option that doesn't fit the description of scientific inquiry as presented in the text is **C**.

Here's why:

The text states that while hobblala winds are powerful and have a specific environment, they *can* blow everything in their path. However, the option saying they *can* blow *everything* is an exaggeration. The text doesn't claim they are omnipotent and can move *absolutely* everything.  Option A is the most inaccurate statement because it presents a superlative degree of power not explicitly stated in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **B: ህቦብላ ንፋስ ካብ ካልእ ህቦብላ ዝነኣሰ ኸባቢታት ይወቅዕ (Hobblala nifas kab kal'e hobblala z'nas kebabiitat yowk'e)** - ""Hobblala winds occur in specific environments different from other winds."" - The text explicitly mentions they occur in specific environments.

Therefore, option A is the most inaccurate statement because it exaggerates the power of hobblala winds.

The hurricane wind rips apart trees, pulls sheets of glass from buildings, and sends debris into the sky. A truly powerful hurricane lasts over three hours.)

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **B: ዳርጋ 480 ማይልስ ኣብ ሰዓት ዝጓዓዝ ንፋስ ይፈጥሩ (They create winds traveling at 480 miles per hour):**  The text says they *can reach* 480 mph, but doesn't state they *always* travel at that speed.
* **C: ካብ ካልኦት ማዕበላት ንላዕሊ ዓበይቲ ኸባቢታት የጥቅዑ (They are more powerful than other storms in the tropical areas):** The text only mentions they are powerful and can cause damage, not that they are definitively *more* powerful than other tropical storms.
* **D: ኣእዋም ካብ ምድሪ ካብ ሱሮም ክብንቁስዎም ይኽእሉ እዮም (Debris can be pulled from the ground to the sky):**  The text *does* mention debris being pulled into the sky, but it's one aspect of the hurricane's impact, not the most defining characteristic described.



Therefore, option A is the best answer because it accurately reflects the core information presented in the text regarding the duration of hurricanes."

Here's why:

* The passage states that ancient people used lenses for magnification. 
* However, true telescopes weren't invented in Europe until the late 16th century.
* The passage highlights that telescopes used *two* lenses working together to see distant objects more clearly. 
* Therefore, the development of **lens making** was a crucial precursor to the invention of telescopes.  They needed to be able to create lenses to build telescopes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሌንሳት ምጥቃም (Lens grinding)** While lens grinding is part of lens making, ""lens making"" is a broader term encompassing the entire process.
* **B: ነገራት ኣጒሉሕኻ ምርኣይ (Viewing distant objects)**  This is the *result* of using telescopes, not something people began to do in the 16th century.  They were *enabled* to view distant objects more clearly *because* of lens making and telescope construction.
* **D: ቴሌስኮፓት ምስራሕ (Telescope construction)** Telescopes weren't constructed in the 16th century; they were invented *using* the newly developed lenses.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the opposite. It argues that technology's influence isn't just in social spheres but extends to the ""essence"" of the societies it's integrated into. It gives the example of a car needing to follow traffic rules, highlighting how the societal infrastructure (traffic laws, road conditions) dictates how technology is used. Therefore, the text emphasizes technology's impact on *non-social* aspects of society.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምዕባለ ተክኖሎጂ ብባህሊ ኣይጽሎን እዩ** - The text directly contradicts this. It emphasizes that technology's influence is intertwined with culture and societal structures.
* **C: ተክኖሎጂ ኣብ ሕብረተሰብ ተፈጥራዊ ጽልዋ ኣለዎ** - The text argues that technology's influence is *not* purely natural or inherent. It's shaped by social and cultural contexts.
* **D: ተክኖሎጅያዊ ምዕባለ ኣብ ፖለቲካዊ ጽልዋ እተመርኰሰ ኣይኰነን** - While the text doesn't solely focus on political spheres, it strongly implies a political dimension through the example of traffic laws and societal regulations. Therefore, it's not accurate to say technological advancement"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ብናይ ገዛእ ርእስኻ ምልክት ርሳስ ክትሰቲ ኣይትፈትን እንተዀነ ግን እቲ ብጽሑፍ ዝሰፈረ ናይ ቀስቲ ምልክት ብሙዚቃ ስለ ዘሎ መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ኣኽብሮት ክወሃቦ ከም ዘለዎ ኣይትረስዕ።"" This translates to: ""If you don't try to interpret the symbol on your own, then usually the written symbol for 'qesti' will have a buzzing and rattling sound in music. Don't ignore it.""

The passage explicitly connects the *written* symbol with a *buzzing and rattling* sound, not a *focused* sound.  The passage focuses on the sound being complex and buzzing, implying it's *not* a focused sound.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጎባጥ ዝመስል ምልክት (A symbol that looks like a bump):** The passage describes the symbol as having a rounded shape, ""ጎባጥ ዝመስል ምልክት"" is accurate.
* **C: ዝሓየለ ድምጺ (A fading sound):** The passage describes a *complex and rattling* sound, not a fading one.
* **D: ካብ ቍርዖብ ጀሚርካ (Starting from the 'qorob'):** The passage states that the sound originates from the 'qorob' (a type of stringed instrument), so this is accurate.



Therefore, the only option that is *not* mentioned in the passage in relation to the 'qesti' symbol is a focused sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ቀስቲ ምስሓብ (Quiet with beating/vibration):** While the text mentions that a quiet symbol vibrates more when a loud sound comes, it doesn't directly connect ""quiet with beating"" as a core association.
* **D: ካብቲ ኢድካ ቐስቲ ሒዝዎ ዘሎ ቦታ ጀሚርካ (Starting from the place where quiet is held):** The text explains that quiet is ""started"" from the ""lower quiet"" symbol.  While related, it doesn't directly describe what is *associated* with the sound, only where it begins.

Therefore, the V-like appearance is the direct association described in the text regarding the quiet symbol and sound.

Here's why:

The passage states that the hominid foot evolved from a chimpanzee-like foot, but with a straighter arch. This change, occurring between 2 and 3 million years ago, shifted the foot's function from grasping (for climbing) to **supporting weight while walking upright**.  

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **በኣእዳውካ ተደጊፍካ ምኻድ (Walking upright)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while chimpanzee arms are similar in length and strength to human arms, the *structure* is different.  It emphasizes the change in function of the arm from locomotion (walking/swinging) to manipulation and tool use. 
* Option B directly reflects this structural difference: the shoulders and arms of hominids are different from those of chimpanzees, allowing for the specific movements required for tool use and manipulation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ካብ ደቂ ሰብ ንላዕሊ ትኽ ዝበሉ እዮም’ (They are taller than humans):** The passage doesn't focus on height.  It emphasizes the *arm structure* and function.
* **C: ክብደት ንምስካም እዮም ዘገልግሉ (They are used for weight bearing):** The passage explicitly states that chimpanzee arms are used for weight bearing *during locomotion*.  Hominid arms evolved beyond this.
* **D: ብቐዳምነት ብኢድ ንምጥቃም እዮም ዘገልግሉ ነይሮም (They were primarily used for pounding):** While tool use (including pounding) evolved, the passage highlights the broader shift from locomotion to manipulation and a wider range of tasks.

This directly links mutation to the introduction of new genetic variation.  Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሕቡእ (Blinking):**  Blinking is a physical action and not related to genetic variation.
* **B: ዳግመ ምትሕንፋጽ (Recombination):** Recombination is the process of shuffling existing genes during sexual reproduction. While it *creates* new combinations of genes, it doesn't introduce entirely *new* genetic material like mutation does.
* **D: ተገሊጹ (Adaptation):** Adaptation is the process by which organisms become better suited to their environment. It's a *result* of genetic variation, not the source of it.



Therefore, **mutation** is the source of new genetic variation."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዳግመ ምትሕንፋጽ (Recombination):**  Recombination is mentioned in the passage as a process where chromosomes from two parents mix and separate in two generations. While related to genetic variation, it's not the *mechanism* by which new genetic variations arise *in the first place*.
* **C: ምልዋጥ (Crossing over):** Crossing over is a specific type of recombination that happens during meiosis, but it's not the overarching term for how new genetic variations are initially created.
* **D: ተገሊጹ (Adaptation):** Adaptation is the process by which organisms become better suited to their environment *over time*. It relies on existing genetic variation, but it doesn't explain the *origin* of that variation.

Here's why:

* The text states that children who are not successful in their studies (meaning they might be stubborn or resistant) *after* analyzing their underlying causes, can improve their ability to perceive pitfalls in their studies. This implies that the underlying cause (the ""ቖልዓ"" - personality/temperament) *influences* their behavior in difficult tasks.

* **A: እቲ ቖልዓ ኣብ ዘስግእ ተግባራት ንኸይጽመድ ይጽዕር (The child with a personality doesn't get stubborn in difficult tasks.)** - This contradicts the text's premise that a personality *can* be a factor in difficulty.
* **C: እቲ ቖልዓ ካብ ማሕበራዊ ዅነታት ይርሕቕ (The personality comes from social situations.)** - While social situations *influence* personality, the text focuses on the *impact* of personality on academic performance, not the origin of the personality.
* **D: እቲ ቖልዓ ምስ ካልኦት ሒደት ዓሌታት ምክፋል ይኣቢ (The personality is independent of other factors.)** - The text suggests that personality is *related* to academic performance, implying it's not entirely independent.

Therefore, option B is the only option that accurately reflects the relationship described in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states that children who don't perform well in school due to difficulty with a particular concept *may* develop warning signs of learning disabilities *after* analyzing their individual learning patterns. This implies the impact is observed *later*, not directly in their personalities, relationships, or the concept itself.  The wording emphasizes a future outcome.

Here's why:

The text states that ""ፈራል"" (socially withdrawn/anxious) children avoid social interaction and don't engage in undesirable behavior. It also mentions that these children often have a caregiver (usually a parent) who displays excessive protectiveness and, in some cases, this protective behavior stems from the child's own physical or mental difficulties.  

Social anxiety directly aligns with the description of a child avoiding interaction and potentially being influenced by a protective caregiver.  The other options aren't explicitly mentioned as defining characteristics of the ""ፈራል"" type of child in the text.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""እቲ ዘላን ቆልዓ ልክዕ ከም ሰብ ዝንከባኸቦም ናይ ዱር እንስሳት ሙሉእ ብሙሉእ እንሰሳታት ስለዘዕበይዎ እቲ ዘላን ቆልዓ ልክዕ ከም ሰብ ዝንከባኸቦም ናይ ዱር እንስሳት ብዝባሃል ከም ፍርሒን ስምዒት ብሕታዊነትን ተላቢሱ."" (The older child, having been raised like an animal by a domestic animal, has become completely like an animal, having absorbed behavior and emotions through mimicry.)  This directly links a *lack of social interaction* (being raised *like an animal*) to *unruly behavior* (mimicking animal behavior).
* While option A mentions physical defects, the text also mentions a lack of social interaction as a cause.
* Option C is incorrect because the text implies that unruly behavior can arise from various causes, not just those related to being raised by a domestic animal.
* Option D is too broad; the text only mentions social interaction as a cause of unruly behavior, not all uncivilized traits.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that traditional farming is primarily for the farmer's own sustenance and to feed their family (""ሕርሻ ነቲ ሓላው ሕርሻን ስድራ ቤቱን ዜድልዮም ነገራት ንምምላእ እኹል ምግቢ ንምድላው ዚግበር ሕርሻ እዩ"" - Farming is a suitable farming that occurs to provide adequate food for the farmer's family and other things they need).  It specifically mentions growing crops adapted to the local climate and using small, sustainable plots.

Options A, C, and D all relate to the farmer's own activities within the farming context. Option B, however, introduces the idea of preparing meals *for others*, which deviates from the passage's focus on farming as a means of providing food *for the farmer's family*.  While a farmer might occasionally share food, the core principle is self-sufficiency for their immediate household.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ብዙሕ ግዜ ኦርጋኒክ ዝኾነ ስርዓት እዩ (Many times it is an organic system)."" and ""ታሪኽ ከምዝሕብሮ መብዛሕትኦም ሓረስቶት ኣብ መነባብሮኣዊ ሕርሻ ዝተጸመዱ እዮም ነይሮም (The history shows that most farmers have been accustomed to traditional farming)."" Traditional farming is characterized by being closely tied to natural cycles and ecosystems.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: ምህርቲ የእኻል ንምምሕያሽ ፍሉይ ሜላታት እዩ ዝጥቀም (Farming uses special plants for fertilization):** While traditional farming *might* use plants for fertilization, it's not the defining characteristic of the entire system.
* **C: ነቶ ሐረስቶት የእኻሎም ኣብ ብምሉኡ ዞባታቶም ከካፍልዎ የኽእሎም (Farmers can distribute it throughout their entire region):**  The passage doesn't discuss regional distribution.
* **D: ኣብ ገለ ሃገራት ዝነብሩ ሓረስቶ ክሳብ ሕጂ ይጥቀምሉ እዮም (Farmers in some countries still use it today):** The passage mentions that the practice is still relevant in some countries, but the *defining characteristic* is its natural and organic nature.

Here's why:

The text describes ""ናይ ምዝንጋዕ ቱሪዝም"" (Scenic tourism) as travel where people go to beautiful places like coastal areas, architectural wonders, and campgrounds to relax and have fun. The question asks about the type of tourism associated with visiting historical sites.  ""ናይ መዘናግዒ ቱሪዝም"" directly relates to visiting sites with architectural or historical significance, which aligns with the description of visiting museums.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ንግዲ ቱሪዝም (Religious tourism):** This is tourism related to religious sites.
* **C: ባህላዊ ቱሪዝም (Cultural tourism):** While visiting museums *can* be cultural tourism, the text distinguishes cultural tourism as aiming to understand a country's culture and history. Visiting museums specifically falls under the broader category of scenic tourism as described in the passage.
* **D: ኣብ ግዳም ዝግበር ቱሪዝም (Adventure tourism):** This is tourism involving risky or physically challenging activities.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""ናይ ምዝንጋዕ ቱሪዝም"" (escape tourism) is about people wanting to dramatically escape their daily lives to relax and have fun in beautiful places. Option B directly reflects this desire to break away from the mundane and routine.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ኣብ ባህሊ እቲ ኸባቢ ምጥሓል (Preserving the culture of the area):** While cultural preservation can be a goal of tourism, the passage focuses on the *motivations* of the tourists in escape tourism, not the goals of the places they visit.
* **C: ኣገደስቲ ገጽ-ምድሪ ምርኣይ (Seeing stunning landscapes):** Stunning landscapes are often *part* of the appeal of escape tourism, but the core motivation is more about escape than just seeing beautiful views.
* **D: ታሪኽ ናይ ሓደ ቦታ ምርዳእ (Discovering the history of a place):**  The passage mentions that some escape tourism aims to understand the culture and history, but it's not the primary defining characteristic of escape tourism as described.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that studying the history of past entrepreneurs (like the example given) helps to revive and build upon entrepreneurial spirit within the church.  It mentions how these historical stories demonstrate how collaboration, vision, and strength can overcome challenges and achieve goals. This directly relates to remembering and applying the entrepreneurial traits of the past to bring about positive change in the present and future of the church.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: ብዛዕባ እቶም ባህሊ ናይቲ ትካል ዝጸለዉ ሰባት ትኹረት ምርካብ (Focusing on the cultural habits of the people who excelled in the organization)** While culture is important, the text is more focused on *entrepreneurial traits* than general cultural habits.
* **C: ናይቲ ትካል መበገሲ ምኽንያታት ምድላይ (Analyzing the reasons for the organization's success)**  The text touches on success, but it's less about analyzing *reasons* and more about learning from the *stories* of success.
* **D: ታሪኽ ናይቲ ትካል ምርዳእ (The origin of the organization's history)**  The text isn't specifically focused on the organization's origins, but rather on how past entrepreneurial spirit can influence the present and future.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ናይ ሓደ ታሪኽ ምርዳእ ማለት ባህሊ ምርዳእ ማለት እኳ እንተዘይኮነ ግን እንተነኣሰ ኣብቲ ታሪኽ ዘለካ ግደ ክትፈልጥ ይሕግዝ። አብዚ አብነት እዙይ ናይ ቐደም ኢንተርፕሪነየር ፀባይ ብምልዓል ስኪዒት ብምምፃእ ንደቒ ሰባት ሓደሽ ለውጢ ንምምፃእን ነቲ ቤተ ክርስትያን ሓዱሽ ኣንፈት ንኽረኽቡን ይሕግዞ的说"". This translates to: ""Understanding the history of one is not necessarily understanding culture, but rather understanding the triumphs that existed in that history. In this example, by fulfilling the entrepreneurial spirit with intensity, it enables new change for people and finding a new hope for the church.""

The passage emphasizes that studying historical triumphs (specifically, the ""history of change through triumph"") is important for understanding how positive change can be achieved and for inspiring future generations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ክብርታት ብምድልዳል (Glories through imitation):** The passage doesn't suggest that imitation is the key to understanding history.
* **C: ኣብ ውሽጢ እቲ ትካል ቦታ ኣለኒ ብምባል (By saying I have a place within the organization):** This has no connection to the passage's theme of historical understanding and change.
* **D: ናይ ስራሕ ጠባይ ብምምሕያሽ (By dominating the work style):**  The passage discusses the entrepreneurial spirit fulfilling a need for change, not dominating work styles.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሓሳባት ብዛዕባ ድሕረ-ዘበናዊ ኣገባብ ትምህርቲ ብልክዕ ዝገልጽ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ኣብ ትምህርቲ ፍጹምነት የለን (There is no perfection in education)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""ንምምሃር ጽቡቕ ዝበሃል መንገዲ የለን። ህ።አቂ ንምዝራብ ዋላ ሓደ ንምምሃር ፅቡቅ ዝኾነ ነገር የለን። (There is no good way to teach. There is no single good thing for understanding the truth.)"" This directly aligns with the idea that perfection in education is unattainable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ገሊኦም ተመኩሮታት ትምህርቲ ካብ ካልኦት ብዝያዳ ጠቓሚ እዩ (Some learning experiences are more useful than others):** The text argues *against* the idea that some experiences are inherently more valuable; it emphasizes the subjectivity of learning.
* **B: ትምህርቲ ኣብቲ ከም እንረኽቦ እንኣምነሎም ነገራት ዘድሃበ ክኸውን ኣለዎ (Education should provide what we believe it should provide):** While the text acknowledges that learning is subjective, it also points out the limitations of simply believing something *should* be provided.  It highlights the reality that we can't just conjure experiences.
* **C: ገሊኡ መንገዲታት ትምህርቲ ካብ ካልኦት ዝሓሸ እዩ (Some methods of teaching are superior to others):**  The text directly refutes this by stating there is no single ""good way"" to teach.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate reflection of the text's core message about the imperfections of education."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሓሳባት ብዛዕባ ኣቀራርባ ድሕረ-ዘበናዊ ኣገባብ ትምህርቲ ብልክዕ ዘይገልጽ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The answer is **D: ዋላ ፈጺምና ኣብ ግብሪ ክነውዕሎ ዘይንኽእል ፍልጠት ምምሃርና ጠቓሚ እዩ (It's not useful to teach knowledge that we can't eventually apply in practice.)**

Here's why:

* The passage heavily emphasizes the importance of experience and application in learning. It argues that learning is most effective when it connects the learner with the world through practical activities. 
* Option D directly contradicts this core argument. The passage implies that learning *is* valuable even if we can't immediately apply the knowledge. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

* **A: ሓበሬታ ክትመሃረሉ ትኽእለሉ ብዙሓት ምንገዲታት ኣለዉ (There are many ways to teach knowledge.)** - The passage acknowledges that we've seen many examples of TV programs, some useful and some not. This supports the idea that there are different methods of teaching.
* **B: ገሊኦም ተመኩሮታት ትምህርቲ ካብ ካልኦት ንላዕሊ ቀዳምነት ክወሃቦም ኣለዎም (Some learning experiences are superior to others.)** - The passage implies this.  The TV program examples demonstrate that some experiences (practical, experiential) are more effective than passive ones.
* **C: ተመኮሮ ትምህርቲ ኣብቲ መምሃራይን ኣብቲ ዝቐረበ ፍልጠትን እዩ ዝምርኮስ (Learning is centered on the learner and the presented understanding.)** - This is a direct paraphrase of the passage's main argument. The effectiveness of learning relies on connecting the learner with the world through experience.



Therefore, only option D clashes with the passage's central thesis about the value of practical learning experiences, even if immediate application isn't always possible.

Here's why:

The text states that if you haven't had a bowel movement in a while, a gentle poke in the lower abdomen can easily trigger one. It also mentions that if you miss your usual time, you can stimulate the defecation process to help relieve constipation. Option B directly reflects this by suggesting smelling and then going straight to the toilet, which is a common method for initiating a bowel movement when constipation is present.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቅድሚ ድቃስ ንሓደ ሰዓትን ፈረቓን ምንባብ (Walking for an hour or so before defecation):** While exercise can be helpful, the text doesn't emphasize this as a primary method for *triggering* bowel movements when constipation has already occurred.
*   **C: ነቲ ኣብ ጥቓኻ ዘሎ ኣላርም ብምዕጻው ድሕሪ ዕስራ ደቒቕ ምድቃስ (Turning off the alarm after 15 minutes of defecation):** This is irrelevant to triggering a bowel movement.
*   **D: ኣብ ጥቓኻ ካብ ዘሎ ጠርሙስ ማይ ክትሰቲ ክትበራበር ከለኻ (Drinking water from a nearby faucet):** While hydration is important, the text focuses on methods to *stimulate* bowel movements when needed, not general hydration.

Here's why:

The text states that the odor of coffee should fade after 10-60 minutes. Option D contradicts this by saying the odor lingers for two hours *after* it's released.  The other options are consistent with the text:

* **A: ኣብ ለውጢ እተመስረተ ክኸውን ይኽእል እዩ** (It can be based on change) - The text discusses how to mask the coffee smell.
* **B: እቲ ሽቶ ሙሉእ ብሙሉእ ባዕልኻ ንኽይትበራበር እዩ** (The odor doesn't completely disappear) - The text implies the odor fades, but doesn't completely vanish.
* **C: እቲ መስርሕ ኣብ እዋን ስሩዕ ድቃስ እዩ ዝግበር** (The process occurs during a fast coffee) - This isn't directly addressed, but masking the smell is relevant regardless of the brewing speed.



Therefore, option D is the statement that *doesn't* accurately reflect the information provided in the text.

Here's why:

The text states that the phenomenon of lucid dreaming (being aware you're dreaming) is often linked to heightened brain activity during REM sleep.  It also mentions that disturbances during REM sleep can lead to problems with reality testing.  Frequent dreaming, especially lucid dreaming, is related to the length or intensity of REM periods.  The longer or more intense the REM period, the more likely it is to trigger these types of experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: መጠን ኩነታት REM (The amount of REM state):** While the amount of REM is relevant, the *duration* or *intensity* within those REM periods is a more specific factor.
* **B: መጠን ጸዓት (The amount of stress):**  The text doesn't directly link frequent dreaming to stress levels.
* **C: ንውሓት ናይቲ ናይ ምሕዋይ ኩነታት (The change in the state of consciousness):** While changes in consciousness are involved, the text points more specifically to the REM period's duration and activity.

Here's why:

* The passage states that fragmented REMs (where sleep cycles are disrupted and periods of REM sleep are interspersed with wakefulness) are a primary cause of experiencing vivid, memorable, and often disturbing dreams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ መንጎ REM ዝነበረ ንውሓት ግዜ ይንኪ (Prolonged periods within REM):** The passage says *shortened* REM periods are linked to disturbing dreams, not prolonged ones.
* **B: ንሕድሕድ ለይቲ ዝበጽሕ REMs ይንኪ (Fragmentation of REMs):** This is the *cause* of disturbing dreams, not a negative consequence that leads to frequent dreaming.  The question asks what *leads to* frequent dreaming.
* **C: ኣብ ምስ ውንኻ ከለኻ ሕልሚ ይምርኮስ (Dreaming about your partner while sleeping):**  Dreaming about a partner is a normal occurrence and not directly linked to experiencing disturbing dreams.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately reflects a negative sleep experience (fragmented REMs) that is associated with frequent and disturbing dreams, as described in the passage."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ልሙዳት ጉጅለታትን ሓሳባዊ ጉጅለታትን ከመይ ኢሎም ይመሳሰሉ?,"The correct answer is **B: ክልቲአን ጉጅለታት ኣብ ማዓልታዊ ንጥፈታተን እተፈላለየ ደረጃ ናጽነት ኣለወን**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""מብዛሕትኡ እዋን ካብ እቶም ናይ ስምዕነት ጉጅለታት ብዝበለፀ ነፃነት አለዎም እዩ"" (most of the time they have a great deal of freedom from traditional groups). This implies that learning groups have a different level of freedom compared to traditional groups.
* **The text also introduces the concept of a ""ዘይረአ ጉጅለ"" (invisible group):**  It describes this as a group where every member reports to a coordinating group and the invisible group sends messages to all members. This contrasts with the more freedom-based nature of learning groups.

Therefore, the text highlights a difference in the level of freedom between learning groups and traditional/invisible groups.  Option B accurately reflects this difference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኩሎም ጉጅለታት ኣብ ሓደ ደረጃ ክጻወቱ ትጽቢት ይግበር** (All groups are expected to play at the same level): The text implies the opposite, there are differences in their functioning.

* **D: ክልቲአን ጉጅለታት ኣብ ተመሳሳሊ ናይ ግዜ ዞባ እየን ዝሰርሓ** (Both groups operate in the same time zone):  The text discusses time zones only in relation to learning groups, not traditional groups.  This is not a central point of comparison.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""መብዛሕትኡ እዋን ካብ እቶም ናይ ስምዕነት ጉጅለታት ብዝበለፀ ነፃነት አለዎም እዩ"" (Most of the time they have a great freedom from status groups).
* **The passage contrasts this freedom with internet-based groups:** It mentions that internet-based groups are "" ኩሉ ኣባል ሪፖርት ዝገብረሉ ናይ ምምሕዳር ጉጅለ እዩ"" (a management group where every member reports) and "" ንኹሉ ኣባል መለክዒ ዘውጽእ እቲ ዘይረአ ጉጅለ እዩ"" (the anonymous group is the one who sends messages to all members). This implies a lack of the same freedom found in traditional study groups.

* **A: ልሙዳት ጉጅለታት መብዛሕትኡ ግዜብዝለዓለ ደረጃ እየን ዝተሓዛ** (I have understood study groups to a large extent) - This is a general statement and not directly addressing what the passage says about their unique freedom.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""እዞም ክልስ ሓሳባት፣ ሰባት ብዛዕባ ዝደልይዎም ነገራት ንምንታይ ከም ዝደልዩዎምን፣ ኣብ ከባቢኦም እንታይ ነገራት ንኽሰርሑን ንኸይሰርሑን ከምዝገብርዎምን ይሓቱ"" which translates to ""These theories provide insight into why people perceive things the way they do, and how they behave in their environment.""

Option B directly addresses this - it's about how a person *perceives* their environment, which is a core concept within the theories of Herzberg and Maslow discussed in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ምስ ዓበኻ ዝፍጠር ሓደስቲ ድልዬታት (Creating new relationships with colleagues):** While relationships are important, the passage focuses more broadly on *perception* and environment, not specifically new relationships.
* **C: ውሽጣዊ ድልዬታት (Intrinsic motivators):** Intrinsic motivators are a *type* of theory (Herzberg's), but option B is a broader application of the underlying principles.
* **D: ሰባት ዝፈትውዎም ነገራት ምርዳእ (Controlling the things people do):**  The passage doesn't focus on control; it's about understanding *why* people behave the way they do based on their perceptions.

Here's why:

The text describes a principle where a minimal instruction can produce a powerful effect by guiding the subject to create a grid-like structure in the void (empty space) that allows thought to flourish. This is essentially about the subject *establishing its own basis for being* in the absence of pre-existing structure.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: ኣብ ውሽጢ ስእሊ ሂወትን ጸዓትን ምፍጣር (Creating life and emotion within the image):** While the principle might *lead to* life and emotion, it's not the core concept itself. The focus is on the fundamental structure creation.
* **C: ነቲ ርእሰ ጉዳይ ኣብ ፍሉይን ውጽኢታውን ቦታ ምሓዝ (Placing the subject in a unique and effective location):** The text isn't primarily about *location* but about *structure*. The subject is creating the location itself.
* **D: ኣብ ውሽጢ ስእሊ ስርዓት ምቛም (Establishing order within the image):** While order *emerges*, the text emphasizes the subject *creating* the order from the void, not simply establishing it within a pre-existing system.



Therefore, option A best captures the essence of the principle described in the text - the subject creating its own foundation for existence within the void.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ነቲ 35 ሚ.ሜ ዝልክዑ ፎቶግራፍ ዘይገልጾ?,"The correct answer is **A: ገና ኣብ ምህርቲ እዩ ዘሎ (It is still in the development)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the 35mm film format, its history, and its relationship to modern digital cameras. It emphasizes that the 35mm format *was* very common. The question asks what the passage *doesn't* say about a 35mm photograph.

*   **B: ብዲጂታላዊ ቅዲ ካሜራ ተቐባልነት ረኺቡ እዩ (It has gained acceptance by digital SLR cameras)** - The passage explicitly states that the 35mm format has been superseded by digital cameras. It also mentions that digital cameras accept the 35mm format.
*   **C: ካብቶም ልሙዳት ቅዲታት ዝተፈለየ መጠነ ዝምድና ኣለዎ (It has a different focal length than other film formats)** - The passage mentions that the 35mm format has a focal length of 35mm, 24mm, and 24mm crop.
*   **D: ኣብ ዓለም እቲ ኣዝዩ ልሙድ ቅዲ እዩ (It is a very common film format in the world)** - The passage says the 35mm format *was* very common, implying that it is less so now.

Therefore, the only thing the passage *doesn't* say about a 35mm photograph is that it is still in the development process. The passage focuses on its historical significance and how it compares to newer technologies.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ኣፍረይቲ ለንስ ኣብ ምህርቲ ለንስ ዝለዓለ መዐቀኒታት ስለ ዚረኽቡ እዚ ጕዳይ እዚ እናነከየ እዩ ዚኸይድ ዘሎ ።"" which translates to ""This problem exists because they obtain greater lens radii in the lens.""  The ""lens radius"" is essentially another way of describing lens speed or curvature.

The text also mentions that the greater lens speed is a disadvantage because it causes more blur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ትሑት ብርሃን ኣብ ዘለዎ ኩነታት ክትጥቀምሎም ዝቐለሉ እዮም (They are able to be used in low light conditions):** While the text *does* mention this as a disadvantage, it doesn't explain *how* the lens speed caused this.
*   **C: ናይቲ ስእሎም ጽሬት ቀዋሚ ንውሓት ማእከል ምስ ዘለዎም ስእልታት ይመሳሰል (The image quality is similar to lenses with a fixed focal point):** The text says the image quality is *not* similar; it's *worse* due to the increased blur.
*   **D: ካብ ቀንዲ ሌንሳት ዝወሓደ ማእከል ሕልኽላኻት ኣለዎም (They have a different optical center from conventional lenses):**  The text doesn't directly state this is the reason for the greater lens speed or the blurriness.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ካብ ናይ የዕብዩ ዘርኢ ሌንስ ድሑር ጎኑ እቲ ዝዓበየ ናይቲ ሌንስ ኽፍቲ ቀዳድ(ፍጥነት) ንእሽተይ እዩ። እዚ ኸኣ ኣብ ትሑት ብርሃን ኣብ ዘለዎ ዅነታት ብዘይ ገለ ብርሃን ክትጥቀመሉ ዘጸግም ሕሱር ለንስታት ከም ዝህሉ ዝገብር ኢዩ。""

This translates to: ""The downside of the achromatic lens is that its focal length is shorter. This also causes the achromatic lens to suffer from aberrations when used in dim light.""

Therefore, the achromatic lens's disadvantage is its reduced performance in dim light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዝለዓለ ነጥቢ ቀዳምነት ዝወሃቦ እንተድኣኾይኑ (If it has a longer focal length):** The passage actually states the opposite - it has a *shorter* focal length.
* **B: ዝወሓደ ባእታታት ሌንስ እንተድኣደሊኻ (If you use a double lens):** The passage discusses achromatic lenses, which are a type of single lens designed to correct color aberrations.
* **D: ዝያዳ ማእከል ሕልኽላኻት እንተደሊኻ (If you use more complex coatings):** The passage doesn't mention the complexity of coatings.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ብዛዕባ መንፈሳዊነት ቅኑዕ መግልጺ ተገይሩ ዘይውሰድ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሰላምን ሓጎስን ዝመልኦ ሃለዋት ኣብ ምርካብ ትዂረት ዝገብር እዩ** (Sweetness filled with peace and joy forms the basis of spirituality).

Here's why:

The passage describes spirituality as a mysterious experience related to the divine or a personal connection to one's own being. It emphasizes that this experience is often felt intuitively and followed by certain rituals or customs.

Option A, ""Sweetness filled with peace and joy forms the basis of spirituality,"" focuses on a *feeling* (peace and joy) as the foundation of spirituality. While positive feelings might accompany spiritual experiences, the passage doesn't state that these feelings are the *basis* of spirituality itself. It emphasizes the mysterious and intuitive nature of the experience.

Let's look at why the other options are *consistent* with the passage:

*   **B: ሰዓብቲ መንፈሳውንት ብዛዕባ ምንፈሳዊ ሓቂ ክፈልጡ ይደልዩ** (Spiritual people desire to understand spiritual truths): This aligns with the passage's description of spirituality as a quest for understanding and connection with the divine.
*   **C: ሰዓብቲ መንፈሳዊነት ብዛዕባ ኣምላኽ ዘለዎም ግንዛበ ንኸዕብዩ ዝሕግዞም ተግባራት ክቕበሉ ይኽእሉ እዮም** (Spiritual people can accept practices that guide them to deepen their understanding of God): This reflects the passage's mention of rituals and customs as a way to deepen spiritual understanding.
*   **D: ቀጥታዊ ናይ ውልቀ ተመኩሮ ንምርካብ ዝግበር ጻዕሪ ምስ ካልኦት ዓይነት ሃይማኖታዊ እምነታትን ኣምልኾን ዝመሳሰል እዩ** (The mysterious experience that forms the basis of spirituality is similar to other types of religious beliefs and faiths): This accurately portrays the passage's description of spirituality as a mysterious experience related to faith and the divine.



Therefore, Option A is the only option that deviates from the passage's core ideas and isn't consistent with the provided text.



"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ናይ መንፈሳዊነት ትዂረት ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ናይ መለኮታዊ ክውንነት ናይ ምፍላጥ ኽእለት ምድላይ (The focus on the ability to experience the divine)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that mystical experience is characterized by a *direct* experience of the divine, felt in the heart or through intuition.  The passage then says that practices and traditions *follow* these experiences to help interpret them.  The *focus* isn't on the ability to experience, but on the experience itself as the core of mysticism.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of mystical tradition as described in the passage:

* **B: ሓበራዊ ተመክሮታት ብምርካብ ምስዓብ (Integrating social experiences):** The passage says mystical experiences often occur in peaceful contentment or joy, and traditions help integrate these experiences.
* **C: ኣብ ሓጎስ ዝመልኦ ኩነታት ሕልና ምትኳር (Reflecting on experiences in moments of joy):** The passage states mystical experiences happen in joy or contentment and traditions guide reflection.
* **D: ብዛዕባ ኣምላኽ ንቑሕ ምዃን (Knowing about God):** While not the *definition* of mysticism according to the passage, understanding about God can certainly be part of a broader spiritual path.



Therefore, focusing on the *ability* to experience the divine is not the defining characteristic of mysticism as presented in the text.

The text explicitly states: ""እቶም ሞሪዮሪ ሓደሽቲ ጉጅለ ናይ ቀንዲ መሬት ማኦሪ ኮይኖም፣ ካብ ኒውዚላንድ ናብ ቻታም ደሴታት ተሰዲዶም ናይ በይኖም ፍሉይን ሰለማውን ባህሊ ከምዘማዕበሉ ዝእምት ሓድሽ መርትዖ ኣሎ"" (The Moriori were a new group of key Maori land, who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, bringing with them a unique and special culture).

The text states: ""For a long time in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who came in large canoes."" It further clarifies that the Moriori were *also* an early group of Maori who settled the Chatham Islands, developing their own distinct culture. However, the Moriori were not the *first* inhabitants. The text implies that the Maori were the first, and the Moriori were a later group *from* New Zealand who moved to the Chatham Islands. Therefore, the earlier group who were believed to have inhabited New Zealand were the Maori.

ነቲ ኣብ ፕዩርላንድ ዝርከብ ሜላ ኦሪጋሚ ምጥቃም ነየናይ መሕቘፊ ወረቐት ይጠቕም?,"The correct answer is **A: እቲ መሕቘፊ ወረቐት ኣብ ሓደ ግዜ ብዙሕ ዕጻፍ ክገብር እዩ ዝመርጽ (The paper is able to fold many times at once.)**

Here's why:

The text states that the ""ጽሩይ መሬት ኦሪጋሚ"" (Flatland Origami) is designed to be folded in a single, continuous fold, like a ""folding crease"" that can't be unfolded. The purpose of this design, created by John Smith in the 1970s, was to allow folding without a file or many motors for assistance.

Option A directly reflects the key characteristic of this origami – its ability to fold repeatedly in a single continuous action. The other options are incorrect because:

*   Option B says the paper has a motor, which contradicts the design's purpose of being foldable without motors.
*   Option C says it creates origami that can be unfolded, which goes against the design's fundamental feature of a non-unfoldable crease.
*   Option D says the paper has only been folded once or twice before, which is irrelevant to the origami's core principle.



"

Here's why:

The text states that Pureland origami was developed by John Smith in the 1970s for **""those without files or those without many motors for buzzing.""**  This implies it's suitable for simpler, less powerful setups.  Option D directly contradicts this, stating it's good for drift motors (which are typically more powerful).

Let's look at why the other options are *consistent* with the text:

* **A: ተመክሮ ንዘለዎም ዓጸፍቲ እተዳለወ እዩ** (It is designed for experienced rafters): This aligns with the idea that Pureland origami was developed for those without the complex tools or power of advanced setups. Experienced rafters might prefer a simpler approach.
* **B: እዚ ሜላ እዚ ንድሕሪት ዝግልበጥ ዕጻፍ ኣየጠቓልልን እዩ** (This place does not use a twisting fold):  The text says all folds have a place, implying it's a general statement. The mention of not needing files or many motors suggests a simpler folding style.
* **C: ዕጻፍ ቀጥታዊ ቦታ ክህልዎ ኣለዎ** (The fold has a straight place): This is also a general statement and could be applicable to many origami folds, including Pureland origami. The text doesn't exclude it.



Therefore, option D is the only one that directly opposes the stated purpose and characteristics of Pureland origami.

The text states that after the Indus Valley Civilization, some scholars refer to it as the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, but others believe it should simply be called the Harappan Civilization.

Therefore, the Indus Valley Civilization is most directly associated with the Harappan Civilization.

* The text explicitly mentions ""ስልጣነ ስንጭሮ ኢንዱስ"" (Indus Valley Civilization) and ""ስልጣነ ኢንዱስ-ሳራስቫቲ"" (Indus-Sarasvati Civilization) as names associated with the Bronze Age civilization in the Indus River Valley.
* The text states that some scholars suggest the civilization might also be called ""ስልጣነ ኢንዱስ-ሳራስቫቲ"" because the later Sarasvati River is believed to be the same as the ancient Indus River.
* **""ስልጣነ ሩባ ኢንዱስ"" (Rupak Indus)** is not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the answer is C because it's the only option not referred to in the provided passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ንናይ ገዛእ ርእስኻ ረብሓ ቀዳምነት ምሃብ (Giving priority to one's own self-interest):** The text emphasizes collaboration, not self-interest.
* **C: ካብ ንብዙሓት ንውሑዳት ኣብ ዝጠቅም ትዂረት ምግባር (Taking the initiative to benefit the few from the many):** The text focuses on the benefit of working with others, not specifically benefiting a small group.

Here's why:

The passage states that successful people often cooperate and utilize various tools. It also mentions that a leader can utilize their own abilities extensively. The key takeaway is that leveraging one's own strengths is important.  If a person *doesn't* utilize their own abilities (lack of self-reliance), they won't be able to achieve the success described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ምትሕብባር (Cooperation):** The passage *mentions* cooperation as a beneficial trait, but it doesn't say it's the *opposite* of lacking self-reliance.  Someone can cooperate *while also* having their own strengths.
*   **C: ምትሕግጋዝ (Planning/Organization):** Similar to cooperation, planning is mentioned as a beneficial trait, not as something that directly opposes self-reliance.
*   **D: ናይ ባዕልኻ ጥቕሚ ምቕዳም (Utilizing one's own abilities):** This is the *opposite* of the scenario the question asks about. The question asks what happens if someone *doesn't* utilize their own abilities.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Roman doctors used tourniquets and arterial clamps to treat gangrene. Option C directly reflects this use of tourniquets to prevent blood flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ድሕሪ ስንባደ ዝመጽእ ጸቕጢ ብዝተፈላለዩ መደንዘዚ መድሃኒት ምሕካም (Treatment with various medicinal plasters after wound infection):** While plasters were used, the text doesn't highlight this as a *key* or *distinctive* medical approach during the Roman period.
*   **B: ስኮፖላማይን ንምሕካም ካብ ፍረታት ኣእዋም ፈሳሲ ምጥቃም (Extraction of scopolamine from nightshade for treatment):** The text mentions that Roman doctors *knew* about scopolamine, but doesn't state they *used* it as a primary treatment. It's more of a known substance than a commonly applied remedy.
*   **D: ንሕሙማት ጋንግሪን ምቑራጽ (Preventing gangrene in patients):** While preventing gangrene was the goal, the text focuses on the *methods* used to treat it *when it already existed* (tourniquets and clamps), rather than preventative measures.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ሓካይም ብሃጸይ ኣውጉስጠ ክኽተቡ ጀመሩ ሕሉፍ ሓሊፎም እውን ድሕሪ እቲ ውግእ ንመጀመርታ ግዜ ዝጥቀሙሉ ዝነበሩ ናይ ሕክምና ሰራዊት ሮማ ኣቘሙ"" (The Romans began to establish military hospitals under Augustus, and in later times they also first used a military medical staff after the war). This directly addresses the creation of military hospitals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣዕናዊ ወተሃደራዊ ፖሊሲ ሃጸያዊት ግዝኣት (The civil military policy of the Roman Empire):** While military hospitals were part of the Roman Empire's overall policy, the passage doesn't focus on the broader civil-military policy.
* **C: ምምስራት ናይ ትምህርቲ ሆስፒታላት (The establishment of teaching hospitals):** The passage mentions hospitals, but doesn't specify the establishment of *teaching* hospitals.
* **D: ምምልማል ዶክተራት ብሃጸይ (The development of medicine under the Romans):** The passage states that Roman medical knowledge was a major contribution and a source of much of today's knowledge. However, it does not explicitly mention the *development of doctorate* in medicine.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the ability to see (""ናይ ምርኣይ ክእለት"") resides within the components of the visual system (""ስርዓት ድህሰሳ ክፍሊ ኣካላት"").  It then goes on to describe how different parts of this system (like the retina) have different capabilities and processes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ኣካል ከማልኦ ዘለዎ ብቕዓት (It's a property like other properties of the body):** While vision is a function of the body, the passage emphasizes it's not just a general bodily property but a *system* with distinct components.
* **C: ንእተወሰነ ንውሓት-ማዕበል ዝስማዓካ ስምዒት (A behavior adapted to a specific environment):** While adaptation is part of how the visual system works, the passage highlights the underlying components and system structure.
* **D: እተፈላለየ ደረጃ ብልሒ (Different levels of calculation):**  While processing involves calculations, the passage focuses on the hardware components involved in vision.



"
ኣብ መንጎ ኣካላት ዘሎ ኣፈላላይ ኣቃውማ ዓይኒ ኣብ ምንታይ እዩ ዝምርኮስ?,"The correct answer is **A: ስምዒት ንውሓት ማዕበል (Response to the stimulus)**.

Here's why:

The text states that different types of eyes (or visual capabilities) exist in different species, each with different properties regarding:

*   Different levels of sensitivity to different wavelengths.
*   Different abilities to focus on different distances.
*   Different methods of processing the information to produce an output.
*   Different ways to operate positively.

The core of these differences lies in how the eye *responds to stimuli*. This is the fundamental aspect of visual capability that differentiates species.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: እቲ ተህዋስ ከማልኦ ዘለዎ ብቕዓት (The wavelength that the organism possesses):** While wavelength sensitivity is *one* difference, it's not the overarching factor. It's *how the eye processes that wavelength* that's key.
*   **C: ደረጃ ብልሒ (Calculation level/Processing level):** While processing level is *part* of the answer, it's a result of how the eye responds to stimuli, not the primary differentiating factor itself.
*   **D: ናይቲ ኣካል ሕልኽላኽ (The body's health/integrity):** This is completely irrelevant to the differences in visual capabilities.

Therefore, **Response to the stimulus** best captures the central point of the text.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""ሲካውያን ንእምነቶም ካብ ሂንዱነት እተፈልየት ሃይማኖט ገይሮም እዮም ዚርእይዋ ፣ ኰይኑ ግና መበቈሉን ልምድታቱን ሂንዱነት ከም ዝዀነ እዮም ዚግንዘቡ"" (Sikhs believe their religion is separate from Hinduism, but they recognize its origins and customs).
* It also mentions that Sikhism arose in the 15th century "" ብጉሩ ናናክ (1469–1539) ተመስረተት ድሕርዚ ትሽዓተ ተወሳኺ ጉሩስ ተኸታቲሎም ሰዓቡ"" (founded by Guru Nanak (1469–1539), followed by nine more gurus). This shows it branched off from Hinduism.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: እቲ መራሒነቲ ሲኪዝም መሰረታዊን ፍሉይን መዳይ እዩ (The leader of Sikhism is a fundamental and unique doctrine)** While Guru Nanak is important, the text emphasizes the *division* from Hinduism, not just his individual doctrine.
* **C: ደድሕሪ ነቲ ጉሩ ናናክ ዝብሃል ሃይማኖት ዝመስረተ ስብ ትሽዓተ ጉሩ ስዒቦም (Subsequently, after Guru Nanak founded the religion, the nine gurus continued it)** This is partially true, but the main point is that Sikhism *originated* from Hinduism.
* **D: ገሊኡ ልምዲታት ሲኪዝም ኣብ ሂንዱይዝም እተመስረተ እዩ (Many teachings of Sikhism are based on Hinduism)** The text states Sikhs *believe their religion is separate*, although they recognize Hindu influences. It doesn't say Sikhism is *based* on Hinduism.

The text explicitly states: "" ኣብ ሲኪዝም ግን ቀንዲ መሰረት እምነት ሲክ ዝዀነ ኣገዳስነት ኣለዎ"" which translates to ""In Sikhism, however, the fundamental basis of faith is the grace of the Guru.""  The Guru's philosophy, or the teachings of the Guru, is presented as the core belief.

The text explicitly states: ""ADD ዘለዎም ቆልዑ ከም ትምህርቲ ቤት ስራሕ ዘለዉ ነገራት ኣብልዕሊ ብምትኳር ብጣዕሚ ይጽገሙ..."" which translates to ""Children with ADD perform exceptionally well on tasks that are part of their schoolwork...""

The passage also details how ADD affects their ability to function effectively in a school setting due to difficulties with processing speed, organization, and following instructions.

While the text mentions other activities like playing games and watching cartoons, it directly links the problem behavior to the challenges they face *in school*. Therefore, school is the most accurate answer.

The text explicitly states: ""ኣእምሮኦም በቲ ስሩዕ ሜላ ክሰርሕ ስለዘይክእל ኣእምሮኦም ንምፍታን “ናብ ሓደጋ ዘውድቕ ባህርይ ዝኣትዉ፣ዝበኣሱን ንባዓል ስልጣናት ዝቃወሙን ” እዮም። (Because their mind cannot work on that fast pace, their mind tends to escape and have a behavior of 'going towards a dangerous sea,' and challenging the authorities.)"" This directly links their tendency to engage in risky behaviors to their inability to process information quickly.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምስ ምዛንኦም ርክብ ንኽገብሩ ንምሕጋዝ (To get attention from their peers):** While attention-seeking *can* be a factor, the text's primary explanation is related to cognitive processing difficulties.
* **C: ካብ ወለዶም ኣቓልቦ ንምርካብ (To challenge adults):**  The text mentions challenging authority figures, but it's presented as a consequence of their processing difficulties, not the core reason.
* **D: ሓንጎሎም ንምንቕቓሕ (To be mischievous):** This is a subjective interpretation and not supported by the text's explanation of cognitive processing.

ብመሰረት እቲ ኣብቲ ጽሑፍ ሓበሬታ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ናይ መደያይቦ ኣብነት ዘይኮን ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ናይ SAT መምህር (SAT Teacher)**.

Here's why:

The passage contrasts traditional project-based learning (which is considered simpler to implement) with scaffolding. Scaffolding is described as requiring significant effort and being more useful for supporting new learning experiences (like a new computer program or a new concept) rather than for guiding established, routine tasks. 

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: ኣብ መጀመርታ ትምህርቲ ዝወሃብ ናይ ኮምፒዩተር ጸወታ (Early computer game teaching):** This is a good example of a *new* learning experience where scaffolding would be beneficial.
*   **C: ናጻ መደብ መጽናዕቲ (Free reading):** While reading is a core skill, it can also involve scaffolding when introducing new vocabulary or complex texts, making it suitable for scaffolding.
*   **D: ናይ ንእሽቶ ጋንታ ኣሰልጣኒ (Little Ganta coach):** This could represent a routine task where scaffolding isn't primarily needed.

*   **B: ናይ SAT መምህር (SAT Teacher):**  SAT teachers are typically focused on a standardized test. The passage implies scaffolding is less relevant for standardized testing as the learning is established and focused on mastering specific skills/knowledge for the test format. The skills taught for SAT are generally already in place, and the emphasis is on test-taking strategies and knowledge review, not the *acquisition* of new concepts.

Therefore, a SAT teacher is the least likely to benefit from scaffolding as described in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states scaffolding is *not* about providing a learning framework like project-based learning.** It highlights that scaffolding supports new learning experiences, similar to a new computer program, and helps with complex tasks. It's a temporary support structure.
* **Options A, C, and D are all consistent with the text's description of scaffolding.** It says scaffolding can be flexible, provides support for new experiences, and helps learners navigate complex tasks.

Therefore, option B directly contradicts the text's assertion that scaffolding isn't a broader learning framework than project-based learning."

The text states: ""ዚ ገጽ ብቐሊሉ ሓንቲ ናይ መርበብ ኣድራሻ ብምእታው ክርከብ ይኽእል እዩ..."" which translates to ""This page can easily be linked with a website address...""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: ምትዕርራይ (reading)** - While the website helps with reading, the core benefit is access to the website itself.
* **B: ጽሑፋት (texts)** - The website contains texts, but the main point is the accessibility through the website address.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the workers' protest in Poland in 1956 was *against* the shortages of food and *increased* wages. 
* Option C, ""ምውሳኽ ምንካይ ደሞዝ"" (Strikes for increased wages), directly reflects the reason for the workers' protest. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሓዱሽ ቀዳማይ ሚኒስተር ምሻም (Appointment of a new Prime Minister):** While the appointment of Władysław Gomułka was a result of the protests, it wasn't the *response* to the protests itself. It was a consequence of Krushchev's attempts to restore order.
* **B: ስርዓት ንምምላስ ታንኪታት ምጥቃም (Use of tanks to restore order):** The text mentions Krushchev initially *considered* using tanks, but ultimately didn't. So, this wasn't a direct response *from* Krushchev that the workers protested *against*.
* **D: ንገለ ቁጠባዊ ጠለባት ኣፍልጦ ምሃብ (Offering some economic concessions):** The text states that Krushchev offered some economic concessions (allowing Gomułka to become Prime Minister) *after* the protests. The protests were about *lack* of these concessions initially.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the Soviet Union was opposed to the alliance because Germany was considered an enemy. This indicates a disagreement on the core issue of alliances.
* The text mentions the differing ideologies (""ዝተፈላልዩ መስርሓት"" - differing ideologies) as a cause of conflict.
* It also points out the disregard for the systems, culture, and values of other nations (""ከይዲን ባህሊን ነተን ሃገራት ንከይስማዕማዓ ጌሩዎን"" - they didn't respect the systems, culture, and values of other nations).
* The text highlights a shift from direct warfare to a ""war of words"" and prolonged conflict over 40 years, demonstrating a clear lack of traditional alliance behavior.

Therefore, traditional alliances are the *least* likely factor that explains the breakdown in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States according to the text. The other options are directly addressed as reasons for the conflict."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ንዕላማ ናይ መትኒ ድራኸታት ኣብ ሙሉእ ኣካላት ብልክዕ ዘይገልጾ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ዋሕዚ ደም ምቁጽጻር (Ważi dema mukuṣṣa'ar - Blood clotting)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how the nervous system regulates blood flow to maintain homeostasis.** It emphasizes the rapid spread of signals throughout the body to respond to threats.
* **The passage mentions:**
    * **ዋሕዚ ደም ከይተመዛበለ ንክቕጽል ንምዕቃብ (Ważi dema keytemezabbele nikqitsel nim'aqab - When blood flow is insufficient, to be revived)** - This refers to the body's response to insufficient blood flow, which the nervous system helps to address.
    * **ሆመስታሲስ ምዕቃብ (Homestasis m'aqab - Homeostasis regulation)** - This is the central theme - maintaining a stable internal environment.
    * **ኣካላዊ ስግኣት ከስዕብ ካብ ዝኽእል ነገር ምርሓቕ (Akalawi sig'at kes'eb kab zik'il neger mirtihak - Preventing internal bleeding)** - This is a direct consequence of the body's response to blood flow issues and is linked to homeostasis.

* **Blood clotting (ዋሕዚ ደም ምቁጽጻር) is a process primarily handled by the blood itself and the coagulation cascade.** While the nervous system *might* indirectly influence it, the passage doesn't explicitly state it plays a direct or significant role in the nervous system's regulation of blood flow for homeostasis.  The other options are directly mentioned or strongly implied within the passage's description of the nervous system's role.



Therefore, blood clotting is the option that is *least* described or directly related to the nervous system's actions in maintaining homeostasis according to the passage.

ኣብ ከበሳ ጊዛ እንታይ ክርከብ ይኽእል?,"The correct answer is **C: ኩሎም ሸውዓተ ዘደንቑ ነገራት** (All seven remarkable things).

Here's why:

The text states that the Great Pyramid of Giza is one of seven remarkable things in Giza. It then describes the Giza Plateau, including the Great Pyramid, the pyramids, tombs, the Sphinx, and temples, all within the Giza Necropolis.  Therefore, all seven remarkable things are located within the Giza Plateau.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: መቓብራት (Tombs):** Tombs are *part* of the seven remarkable things, but not all of them.
* **B: ኣብያተ መቕደስ (Temples):** Temples are also *part* of the seven remarkable things, but not all of them.
* **D: ዓብዪ ፒራሚድ (Great Pyramid):** The Great Pyramid is one of the seven, but not *all* of them.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""ሳሀላንትሮፐስ ቅድሚ ሸውዓተ ሚልዮን ዓመት ብኽልተ ኣእጋሩ ተጓዒዙ ኪኸውን ይኽእል እዩ"" (Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs 7 million years ago).
* It also mentions that Australopithecus was primarily quadrupedal (""እዚ ኣውስትራሎፒትከስ ብልምዲ ቀኒዑ ኣይኸይድን ነይሩ"" - This Australopithecus did not walk on two legs).
* Homo erectus is mentioned as developing bipedalism later (""እቲ ናይ መጀመሪያ መጓዓዚያ ብእግሪ ምንቕስቓስ እዩ ወዲ ሰብ አብ ዘመነ ሆሞ ኢሬክተስ(...)"" - The first locomotion was man walking on two legs in the era of Homo erectus).

The passage states that during the North Atlantic War, the German navy primarily used the U-boat to disrupt traffic and threatened Britain. 

While Americans were also involved in the North Atlantic War, the passage specifically highlights the German navy's actions and the U-boat threat as the central focus.

The text states: ""ኮረቻ ገና ስለዘይተመሃዘ እቶም አስሪያን ካቫለሪ ኮሮቻ ብዘይብለን ፈረስ ይዋግኡ ነይሮም።"" This translates to: ""Since they hadn't yet learned to ride horses, the Assyrians and cavalry fought in chariots without horses.""

Therefore, the Assyrians lacked the ability to effectively use chariots because they hadn't yet mastered horseback riding.

ናይ ፈረስ ሰራዊት ዝጥቐሙ ዉግእ ብኸመይ ይገጥሙ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ ፈርስ ተወጢሕካ (Sitting on a horse)**.

The text states that cavalry (வைக்እ) fought *on horseback* (ብፈረስ ዝግበር ውግእ). Therefore, the answer describing fighting *on a horse* is the most accurate.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ብእግሪ (On foot)** - Cavalry is defined by fighting *on* horses, not on foot.
*   **B: ብዘይ ድርዒ (Without discipline)** - While battles might not always be perfectly disciplined, the defining feature of cavalry is riding horses.
*   **D: ብዉሑድ ቑጽሪ ወተሃደራት (With a large number of soldiers)** - The text mentions around 1000 initial enemy soldiers, but the core of cavalry is the *horseback fighting* itself."

Here's why:

* The text states that only priests were allowed to enter the inner sanctuary. 
*  The passage mentions that sacrifices were brought *before* the idols, and offerings were made *to* them. 
*  Therefore, the average Babylonian citizen would **not** have been able to enter the inner sanctuary to make offerings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ቐጽሪ ቤት-መቕደስ መስዋእቲ እንዳምጸአ (Offering sacrifices at the temple altar):** The text says sacrifices were offered *before* the idols, not at the temple altar.
* **B: ኣብ ሓደ መሰረታዊ ቤት-መቕደስ ዝግበር በዓል ክሳተፍ (Participate in a festival held at a basic temple):** The text mentions festivals, but doesn't indicate whether all citizens could participate.  More importantly, it focuses on the restricted access to the inner sanctuary.
* **C: ኣብ ቐጽሪ ቤት-መቕደስ ዝግበር ፌስቲቫል (A festival held at the temple):** Similar to option B, while festivals occurred, the key point is the average citizen couldn't enter the inner sanctuary for these festivals.

The passage states that the people of Babylon celebrated festivals (በዓላትን ጽንብላትን ኣቢሎም ድልየታት እቶም ጣዖታት ክፍጽሙ ይሙኩሩ) and offered sacrifices to the gods. Festivals were a key part of their religious practices and were performed *for* the gods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ዉሽጢ ቕዱስ ቦታ (Inner Holy Place):** The inner holy place was a specific part of the temple, not a festival.
*   **C: ጽምብላት (Fasting):** Fasting was an act of devotion, but not a festival.
*   **D: ዚጉራትስ (Zigurats):** Zigurats were the temple towers, not festivals.

Therefore, festivals are the most direct and relevant answer to the question of what the people of Babylon did *for* the gods.

The text explicitly states: ""ብ1922 መቓብሩ ምስ ተረኽበ ውሩይ ኮነ"" which translates to ""In 1922, his tomb was discovered and he became famous."" The text then goes on to describe the treasures found in his tomb, which significantly increased his renown. Therefore, his fame increased *after* his tomb was discovered.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that Tutankhamun's tomb was remarkably untouched compared to other pharaohs.  It states that even though powerful tombs from the past had been looted, Tutankhamun's remained intact until 1922.  This discovery is presented as the key to understanding his significance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ዝርዝር ናይ ጥንታዉያን ንጉስ ዝነበረ ደረጁኡ (His rank listed among ancient pharaohs):** The passage explicitly says he wasn't well-documented in historical lists.
* **C: ካብ መቓብሩ ዝተዘመቱ ብኣሽሓት ዝቑጸሩ ኢደ-ጥበብ (The priceless artifacts taken from his tomb):** While the artifacts are important, the passage highlights the tomb's undisturbed state as the primary reason for his fame.  The value of the artifacts is a *result* of the undisturbed tomb.
* **D: ኣብ እዋን ናይ ጥንታዊ ግብጻውያን ዘመን ዝነበሮ ጥቕሚ (His importance during the time of the ancient Egyptians):** The passage doesn't focus on his importance *during* his reign; it focuses on his significance *after* his tomb was discovered.

Here's why:

The passage states that Homer was a "" ዓይነ-ስዉር ገጣሚ"" which translates to ""blind poet.""  Therefore, he couldn't have *seen* to write about things he observed, he couldn't *hear* the events directly, and while he could have reasoned and discussed, the core of his poetic work relied on oral tradition and the stories he *heard* passed down.

The passage emphasizes his blindness as a defining characteristic relevant to his poetic work.

* **Pythagoras is described as being *outside* of literature:** The question asks for someone ""outside of literature.""  Pythagoras is known for his mathematical contributions, not for writing literature.
* **The others are writers:** Homer is a poet, Sophocles and Aristophanes are playwrights.

The passage states: ""መብዛሕትኡ ህይወት ስድራ ቤት እብራውያን ኣብ ግዳም እብራውያን ኣጋጢሙ"" which translates to ""Most of the life of the Jewish community took place in the desert.""  Therefore, the answer is ""in the desert.""

ነቶም እብራውያን ስድራቤት ብዙሕ ኣገዳሲ ዘይነበረ ነገር እንታይ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ቤቶም (Their homes)**.

The passage states: "" ኣብቲ ምዉቕ ሃዋህው ማእከላይ ምብራቕ እታ ቤት ክሳዕ ክንድቲ ኣገዳሲት ኣይነበረትን"" which translates to ""In the arid Middle East, the house was not considered very important.""

Therefore, the passage emphasizes that homes were not particularly significant to the ancient Hebrews.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብ መንጎ ስካንዲነቫዉያን ሃገራት ከም ፍልልይ ዘይገልጹ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **A: እቲ ታሪኽ (The history)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while there was a concept of ""Scandinavia,"" there were *many discrepancies* between the history, customs, and traditions of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.  The passage doesn't mention discrepancies regarding the land itself or the people. Therefore, history is the one element explicitly mentioned as being a source of differences.



"
ኣብ ግሪንላንድ መጀመርታ ዝሰፈረ መን እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ቐቢላ እስኪሞ (Inuit)**.

The text states: ""দিগকে ገበን ቅትለት ካብ ኣይስላንድ ድሕሪ ምስዳዱ ንግሪንላንድ ረኺቡ ግሪንላንድ ኢሉ ሰመያ። እንተዀነ ግን እቲ ዝረኸቦ ርኽበት ብዘየገድስ ኣብቲ ግዜ እቲ ዓሌታት ኢስኪሞ ድሮ ኣብኡ ይነብሩ ነበሩ ።"" which translates to: ""After Erik the Red landed from Iceland, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland. However, regardless of this, the land was inhabited by the ancient Inuit at that time.""

Therefore, the Inuit were the original inhabitants of Greenland.

ብዘይ ኮፍ መበሊ ክድረሩ ዝመርጹ ጉጅለ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **B: ድኻታት ሮማዉያን ኣሰብኡት (Poor Romans ate the leftover food)**.

The passage states: ""ከምኡውን ዶርሙዝ ዝበሃል ዓይነት በትሪ ዝኣመሰለ ፍልይ ዝበለ ድግስ ይገብሩ ነበሩ ካልእ ፍልልይ ከኣ እቶም ድኻታትን እታ ሰበይትን ኣብ ሰድያ ኾፍ ኢሎም ምግቦም ኪበልዑ ኸለዉ እቶም ሃብታማት ግን ምግቦም ኪበልዑ ኸለዉ ኣብ ጐድኖም ኰይኖም ድግስ ኪገብሩ ይፈትዉ ነበሩ.""

This translates to: ""And another type of dish, like dormouse in a pot, was served. Another difference was that the poor and the slaves were not allowed to eat from the table, while the wealthy were allowed to eat from their own tables.""

Therefore, the poor Romans ate the leftovers."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ክፋል ናይ ጥንታዊ ሮማዊ በዓል ክኸዉን ዘይክእል ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ሸሓኒ ናይ ዝተጠበሰ ታኪን (Roast Pig)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ancient Romans *did not* have roasted pig (or similar meats like pork, beef, etc.). It mentions they didn't eat things like ham, bacon, or pork, and they didn't have culinary traditions involving them.

Let's look at why the other options *could* be part of a Roman feast:

*   **A: ድኻታት ዕዱማት ኣብ ኮፍመበሊ ድራር ዝበልዑ (The poor eating dormice in a baked crust):** The passage mentions the poor would eat dormice, so this is plausible.
*   **B: መኽፈቲ ሸዉሃት ናይ ኣሮነ (Roast chicken of Aaron):** While the passage doesn't mention chicken specifically, the general concept of roasting poultry *could* have existed, even if not as a central element of their cuisine. 
*   **C: ሃብታማት ኣሰብኡት ኣብ ግዜ ድራር ምግንባዎም (The wealthy having their food prepared during the feast):** The passage mentions the wealthy prepared food during feasts, so this is entirely plausible.

Therefore, the only option directly contradicted by the passage is roast pig, making it the answer.

ኣብቲ መግለጺ ምርኩስ ብምግባር፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ነባሪ ጽልዋ ክህልዎ ዘይክእል ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ማሕበረሰብ (Society)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that the power of a society is derived from the collective efforts of its people and its unique culture. It highlights that power is linked to the state or government. Therefore, a society *is* the collective of people, not something that lacks power.

Let's look at why the other options *do* have a connection to the passage:

* **B: ንእሽተይ ባህሊ (Minority Culture):** The passage states that cultures often have historical roots and are not always consistent, implying that minority cultures *could* potentially lack the consistent, ingrained power of the dominant culture.
* **C: ከተማ-ግዝኣት (City-State):** The passage mentions that governments predated nations, suggesting that city-states were early forms of political power.
* **D: ዝማዕበለ ባህሊ (Dominant Culture):** The passage explicitly links power to the dominant culture and the ingrained traditions of a society.



"

The passage explicitly states: ""מንግስትታት ከተማ ቕድሚ ሃገራት እየን ዚመላለሳ።"" which translates to ""Governments moved from city-states before nations."" This directly answers the question of what comes before a nation in the description.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the Drungkyl Dzong was created by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in 1649 to commemorate the victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.  Option A accurately reflects this.
* Option B is true (it *is* located in Bhutan), but the question asks for a *false* description.
* Option C is mentioned in the text (the Dzong was damaged by a flood), but not as its primary purpose.
* Option D is true (it *was* built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal).

Therefore, option A is the only one that describes something *not* stated as the Dzong's original purpose, making it the false description.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ብ1951 ከም ምስሊ ዛብድሩንግ ንጋዋንግ ናምጃል ዝኣመሰለ ቅርስታት ድሩክጊል ዶንግ ጥራይ ከም ዚተርፍ ዝገበረ ባርዕ እዩ ። ድሕሪ እቲ ሓዊ እቲ ዕርዲ ተዓቂቡን ተዓቚቡን እዩ ፣ እዚ ኸኣ ሓደ ኻብቲ ኣብ ቡታን ዚርከብ ማራኺ ቦታታት እዩ ነይሩ।""

Translation: ""In 1951, the traditions of Drunggyel Dong, like Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, were only preserved as a memory. After the wind, the dharma followed and flourished, and this became one of the secret places in Bhutan.""

This indicates that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel followed the initial establishment of Drunggyel Dong and the dharma flourished afterward. Option D accurately reflects this sequence of events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዝተረፈ ቕርሲ ምስሊ ናይ ዝሃብድሩግ ነጋዋንግ ናምግይል ጥራይ ነበረ (It was only the remaining memory of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel):** While the text mentions it as a memory, it doesn't imply it was *only* a memory. It flourished and became a secret place.
* **B: እቶም ሓይልታት ናይ ቲበታን-ሞንጎል ተዓወቱ (The Tibetan-Mongol forces won):** The text mentions the victory, but the focus is on the establishment and subsequent flourishing of Drunggyel Dong and the dharma. It doesn't center on the victory itself.
* **C: እቲ ተሳሓብነት ናይ ተፈላጥነት ኣይተተንከፈን (The unity of diversity was not opened):** This option is irrelevant to the text, which focuses on the establishment and flourishing of a specific religious and cultural center.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ብዛዕባ ካምቦድያ ሓቒ ዝኾኑ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **A: እቶም ቬትናማዉያን ንፎኖም ፈን ኣዕነዉዎ (Vietnamese conquered Phnom Penh)**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text states:** "" ኣብተን ናይ መወዳእታ ዓመታት መበል 18 ዘመን እውን ቭየትናም ንካምቦድያ ወረርዋ"" (In the late years of the 18th century, Vietnam also conquered Cambodia).  It then specifically mentions the conquest of Phnom Penh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ካምቦድያ ኣብ 1772 ንታይላንድ ወረረታ (Cambodia conquered Thailand in 1772):** The text says Thailand conquered Cambodia in 1772, not the other way around.
* **C: ኣብ መጀመርታ 18 ክፍለ ዘመን ካምቦድያ ብቬትናሚዝ ተወረት (Cambodia was conquered by Vietnam in the early 18th century):**  The text mentions Vietnam conquering Cambodia in the *late* 18th century, not the early.
* **D: እቶም ተያስ ንፎኖም ፈን ኣዕነዉዎ (The Thais conquered Phnom Penh):** The text refers to Vietnam conquering Phnom Penh, not the Thais.



"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ወራር ናይ ካምቦድያ ብቕኑዕ ዝገልጹ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The best answer is **D: ብዙሕ ግዜ ተያስ ንካምቦድያ ወረረታ (Often Thailand invaded Cambodia)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the *most accurate* description of the wars Cambodia faced.** The passage states that both Thailand and Vietnam repeatedly invaded Cambodia in the 18th century. It specifically mentions Thailand's repeated invasions and the 1772 sacking of Phnom Penh.  While Vietnam also invaded, the passage emphasizes the repeated nature of Thai invasions.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ብዙሕ ግዜ ቬትናማዉያን ንካምቦድያ ወረርዋ (Often Vietnamese invaded Cambodia):** This is partially true, but the passage highlights Thailand's more frequent and significant involvement.
* **B: እቶም ተያስ ከምኡዉን ቬትናማዉያን ንካምቦድያ ኣብ 1772 ወረርዋ (Both Thailand and Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1772):**  While correct that both invaded, focusing solely on 1772 isn't the best summary of the *repeated* warfare.
* **C: እቶም ቬትናማዉያን ንፎኖም ፈን ኣዕነዉዎ (Vietnamese sacked Phnom Penh):** This is only true for *one* instance (not mentioned in the passage), and doesn't reflect the broader pattern of warfare.

Therefore, **D** is the most encompassing and accurate description based on the given passage."

Here's why:

* The text states that the Dutch East India Company established a base in **southern western Taiwan** and that they encouraged Chinese people to cultivate **rye and sugarcane** (not wicker weaving). 
* The text mentions that the Qing dynasty, which later took control, continued the practice of wicker weaving. Therefore, the Dutch East India Company didn't *adopt* ancient wicker weaving; they focused on other agricultural products.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ደብባዊ ምዕራብ ክፋል ናይቲ ደሴት መዕረፊ ገይሮም (Established a port in the western part of the island):** The text explicitly mentions they established a base in the **southern western** part of the island, implying a port was part of that establishment.
* **C: ኣብ ሕርሽኦም ቻይናዉያን ሰራሕተኛታት ቖጺሮም (Exploited Chinese workers in the plantations):** The text states the Dutch encouraged Chinese people to work in the plantations, implying exploitation was likely present.
* **D: ቑጽጽር ናይ ታይዋን ብፍታዉ ንንግስነት ኪንግ ምሕዳግ (Future of Taiwan under the Qing dynasty):**  The text explains that Taiwan came under Qing rule *after* the Dutch, so they had to consider the future under the Qing dynasty.

Therefore, the only action the Dutch East India Company *didn't* do, according to the text, was to adopt ancient wicker weaving.

The passage states that the Shimonoseki Treaty, signed in 1895, ceded Taiwan to Japan, effectively granting Japan power and control over the island until 1945. Option D directly reflects this outcome.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስዕረት ጃፓን ኣብቲ ቐዳማይ ሲኒ-ጃፓኒዝ ኩናት (The beginning of Japan in the first Sino-Japanese war):** While the treaty was a result of the Sino-Japanese War, it doesn't define the war's beginning.
*   **B: ደረጃ ናይ ታይዋን ኣብ ትሕቲ ንግስነት ኪንግ (The status of Taiwan under the Qing Dynasty):** The treaty ended Qing Dynasty rule over Taiwan, so this option is inaccurate.
*   **C: ናይ ታይዋን ክእለት ቑጽጽር ናይ ገማግም ባሕርታት ንኽትመልስ (Taiwan's future as a return to the Pacific Ocean):** The treaty didn't outline Taiwan's future return to the Pacific, it transferred it to Japanese rule.

መጠን ፒኤች ናይ ሓደ ቐመም ብኸመይ ይዕቐን?,"The correct answer is **C: መጠን ናይ ሃይድሮጅን ኣዮናት ኣብቲ ቐመም**.

Here's why:

* **pH is defined as a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution.** The provided text explicitly states this: ""מጠን ፒኤች ብመጠን ሃይድሮጅን (ኤች አብ ፒኤች) እዩ ዝልካዕ"" which translates to ""The pH level is measured by the amount of hydrogen (H) in pH.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ ቐመም ማዕረ ክንደይ ቤዚክ ወይ ኣሲድ ምኹኑ** (How basic or acidic the solution is) - This is a *result* of the concentration of hydrogen ions, not the defining factor.
* **B: ኣብቲ ቐመም ክንደይ ዝኣኽሉ ፕሮቶናት ከም ዘለዉ** (How many protons it contains) - While protons are related to hydrogen ions, the pH specifically measures the *concentration* of hydrogen ions, not the total number of protons.
* **D: ኣብቲ ቐመም ክንደይ ዝኣኽሉ ኤሌክትሮናት ከም ዘለዉ** (How many electrons it contains) - Electrons are not directly related to pH.  pH measures hydrogen ions, which are protons *plus* an electron.

Therefore, the pH is directly related to the amount of hydrogen ions present in the solution.



"
ካብ ሃይድሮጅን ኣዮናት እንታይ ተኣልዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ፕሮቶናት (Proton)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that hydrogen ions are ""ሃይድሮጅን ኣዮናት ኤሌክትሮኖም ሙልእ ንሙልእ ክእለዩ ዝገበሩ ፕሮቶናት እዮም"" which translates to ""hydrogen ions are protons that have electrons to fill.""  Therefore, a hydrogen ion is a proton with an electron.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ፒኤች (pH):** pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions, not something hydrogen ions are *made of*.
* **C: ኣልካላይን (Alkaline):** Alkaline refers to a solution with a pH above 7, indicating a base, not a component of a hydrogen ion.
* **D: ኤሌክትሮናት (Electrons):** While hydrogen ions *have* electrons, the question asks what is *released* from a hydrogen ion.  The text focuses on the proton aspect.

Here's why:

* **The text describes the lion as a powerful and fiercely protective animal.** It emphasizes its strong familial bonds, its territorial nature, and its aggressive defense of its pride.
* **Option B directly contradicts this description.** The text portrays the lion as a creature of raw power and instinct, not something connected to sacred or holy aspects of humanity. The other options *do* align with the text:
    * **A: ምስ ዕስለ ኣኻልብ ተመሳሳሊ ጠባይ የርእዩ** (They exhibit similar traits to the lion's heart): This reflects the text's description of the lion's strong, protective, and aggressive nature.
    * **C: እቶም ተባዕትዮን ኣንስትዮን ብቐረባ ዝዛመዱ እዮም** (The males and females are closely related): This directly reflects the lion's pride structure and familial bonds.
    * **D: ቐተልትን ሕዉሳትን እዮም** (They are fierce and dangerous): This aligns with the text's depiction of the lion's aggressive and territorial behavior.



Therefore, option B is the statement that *doesn't* accurately reflect the description of the lion provided in the text.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the lion's social behavior, its pride structure, and its predatory nature *specifically*. It details the hierarchical relationships within the pride, its relationships with females and cubs, and its aggressive tendencies.

Option A, ""They are very lively animals,"" is a general statement about lions and doesn't relate to the specific behaviors described in the text. The other options *do* directly reflect the information provided:

*   **B: ባህርያቶም ምስ ናይ ተዃሉ ዝዛመድ እዩ (Their characteristics are related to a pack.)** - The passage explicitly states that lion prides resemble packs.
*   **C: ተባሕትዮን ኣንስትዮን ንተሃዳናይ እንስሳ ኣዝዮም ቐተልቲ እዮም (They are very aggressive towards females and cubs.)** - The passage describes the lion's aggressive behavior, especially towards members of its pride.
*   **D: ባህርያቶም ንኻልኦት ዓበይቲ ደማሙ ተመሳሰሊ እዩ (Their characteristics are similar to other big cats.)** - The passage mentions that lions are different from other big cats in their behavior (specifically, their lack of hibernation).

Therefore, option A is the least relevant description of the lion's behavior as presented in the passage."

Here's why:

The passage states: "" ኣብ ትሕቲኡ ኸኣ ካብ ማንቲለ ኽሳዕ ኣንትሎፕን እራብን ዚርከብ ማእከላይ ግዝፊ ዘለዎ ግዳይ ዚበልዓ ማእከላይ ግዝፊ ዘለወን ድሙ ኣለዋ。"" This translates to: ""Beneath it is a tooth that extends from the mantle to the antelope and giraffe, with a central ridge, and a tooth that extends from the mantle to Antelope and Giraffe, with a central ridge.""  This describes a tooth with a central ridge (or groove).

The question asks what kind of teeth the Mantilleus (מנטיለ) have.  Since the passage describes a tooth with a central ridge that extends from the mantle to antelope and giraffe, it implies a **central-crowned tooth** (ማእከላይ ዓቐን ንዘለዎም ደማሙ).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ንኣሽቱ ደማሙ (For the Antelope teeth):** While Mantilleus are associated with Antelopes and Giraffes, the passage is describing a specific tooth characteristic.
*   **B: ንዓበይቲ ደማሙ (For the Beaver teeth):** This is completely irrelevant as the passage doesn't mention beavers.
*   **D: ዓጋዜናት (Incisors):** Incisors are teeth used for biting and are located at the front of the mouth; this description is for a tooth located further back.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that servals eat a variety of animals, not just small ones. It mentions they prey on gazelles, antelopes, and other animals.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: ምስ ከባቢኦም ምምስሳል (Camouflage with the environment):** The passage says servals have spotted coats that help them blend in with their surroundings, which is a form of camouflage.
* **B: ሽታ ናይ ዝሃድንዎ እንስሳ ምኽታል (Digesting the prey's stomach):** The passage mentions that scientists believe servals digest their prey's stomach contents, indicating this behavior.
* **C: ዝሃድንዎ እንስሳ ኣብ እዋን ለይቲ ምኽታል (Hunting prey at night):** The passage states servals are nocturnal hunters, meaning they hunt at night.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""ተመራመርቲ ስነ ፍልጠት ኦሰሎት ደድሕሪኦም ብምስዓብ እንስሳታት ብምሽታት ከም ዚበልዑን ናብቲ ኣብ ምድሪ ዝነበርዎ ቦታ ኸም ዜፍስሱን እዮም ዚሓስቡ"" (Scientists believe that ocelots hunt animals by pouncing on them and dragging them to the ground).  This indicates they *do* have a strong hunting ability.

* The other options are all supported by the text:
    * **A: ለይቲ ብጽቡቕ ክሃድኑ ይኽእሉ (They can hunt well):** The text implies this by describing their hunting technique.
    * **B: ብጽሞና ይንቀሳቐሱ (They move silently):**  The text says, ""ብለይቲ ብደንቢ ክሪኡ ይኽእሉ, ከይተፈለጡ ቀስ ኢሎም ክንቀሳቐሱ እውን ይኽእሉ"" (They can call out with a squeak, and if they don't want to, they can also move slowly).  Slow movement contributes to silent hunting.
    * **D: ንኣሽቱ እንስሳታት ክሃድኑ ይመርጹ (They prefer to hunt small animals):** The text says, ""ናይ በረኻ ድሙ ኣድፊጦም ተሓቢኦም ብምጽናሕ ሃንደበት ናብቲ ዝሃድንዎ እንስሳ ብምዝላል እዮም ዝሕዝዎ"" (Their wild blood drives them to drag their prey to the place where they hunt). This implies they hunt small animals.



Therefore, option C directly contradicts the information given in the text."

Here's why:

The text describes the jaguar as being able to:

*   **ክሓኩር (Kihakur - To climb)** - ""not very high""
*   **ክሕንብስ (Kihnubs - To swim)**
*   **ዓበይቲ ርሕቐታት ክዘልል (Abeyti rihqatihikzelal - To catch prey)**
*   **ሓሙሽተ ዕጽፊ ናይ ጠንካራ ሰባት ክስሕብ (Hamusht'a ezifi nay tenkara setbat ksehib - To lift five times the strength of a man)**
*   **ምስ ኣንበሳ፤ ዓር ዓር ነብሪ፤ ጃጉዋርን ኣብ ተመመሳሳሊ ጉጅለ(ጀኑስ ፓንቴራ) ይርከብ (Mis Anbesa; Ar Ar Nebri; Jaguarin ab tememasali gujle (genus Panthera) yirkeeb - Rides with the lion, jaguar in a similar group (genus Panthera))**

The text specifically states that the jaguar's strength isn't in climbing like a lion, but rather in being a strong swimmer and having a unique mental strength. Climbing isn't mentioned as a strength the jaguar possesses. The other options (swimming, strength, catching prey) are all strengths mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the ability to climb is the one strength the text says the jaguar *doesn't* excel at compared to other animals, and hence is the most unexpected.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ናይ እቲ ነብሪ ገዓር ከም ምሉእ ናይ ኣንበሳ ገዓር ኣይኮነን፣ ነገር ግን ከም ደቋሲ ፣ ከም ኣዉያት ምሉእ-ሓሳባት ዓይነት እዩ።"" This translates to: ""The roar of the leopard is not like the full roar of a lion, but rather like a growl, like a warning."" This directly compares the roar of the leopard (ነብሪ) to a growl, implying a difference in the *ability to roar* compared to a lion (ኣንበሳ).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ድምጺ ናይ ኣገዓዕርኦም (Their sound of the voice):** While related to roaring, the text focuses on the *type* of roar, not general sound.
*   **C: ክነጥሩሉ ዝኽእሉ ርሕቐት (The friendships they can make):** The text mentions they can be friends with animals, but this isn't a point of comparison between the leopard and the lion.
*   **D: ሓይሊ ናይ ስሕበቶም (The strength of their hunting):** The text doesn't discuss their hunting strengths.

Therefore, the most accurate difference highlighted in the text between the leopard and the lion is their *ability to roar*."

The text states: ""ናይ ገዛ ክፍሊ እዮም ዝመስሉ። ንሱ ዝሞቱ ዋህዮታት ንምዕዛብ እቲ ቀዳማይ ሰብ እዩ ነይሩ।"" which translates to ""They resemble the cells of the body. He was the first person to observe dead cells.""

Therefore, Robert Hooke was the first to observe dead cells using a microscope.

ናይ “ዋህዮ” እትብል ቃል መበቖላ እንታይ ማለት እያ?,"The correct answer is **B: ንእሽተይ ክፍሊ (n'ishingtay kifrli)**, which means ""small part"" in Amharic.

The passage explains that ""cell"" comes from the Latin word ""cella,"" meaning a small compartment. It then describes how living things are made up of these small compartments or divisions.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ገሊኦም እንስሳታት ዘይብሎም ነገር እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ዋህዮታት (roots)**.

The passage states: ""P: እንስሳታት ብዋህዮታት ዝቆሙ እዮም።"" which translates to ""Animals stand on roots.""  The question asks what many animals *don't* have according to the text. Therefore, roots are the answer.

The text states: ""ኣትክልቲ ነቲ ምግቦም ካብ ጸሓይ ብፎቶሲንተሲስ እዮም ዚገብርዎ"" which translates to ""Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis.""

Therefore, the sun is the thing that plants use to make food.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብነታት ንመስርሕለዉጢ ዝዕንቕጹ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **B: ክፋል ናይ ሓደ ህዝቢ ናብ ሓድሽ ከባቢ ምኻዶም (Part of a population migrating to a new habitat)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that speciation (the formation of new species) begins when a *part* of a population migrates to a new environment. This migration is the initial trigger for the evolutionary changes that eventually lead to the separation of the populations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ንኣሽቱ ጉጅለ ኣብ ሓድሽ ቦታ ክነብሩ ዘይምኽኣሉ (The failure of a group to settle in a new place):**  While failure to settle *can* happen, it doesn't initiate the process of speciation. Speciation starts with successful migration.
* **C: ሓደ ህዝቢ ኣብ ዉሽጢ ሓደ ሓድሽ ከባቢ ምቕማጦም ምድላዎም (A population settling and adapting within a new habitat):** This describes adaptation to a new environment, but not the initial step of separation that leads to speciation.
* **D: ሓደ ህዝቢ ኣብ መወዳእታ ክልተ ሙዃን (A population splitting into two at the end):**  This is the *result* of speciation, not the initial event that starts it. The text describes the process leading *to* the split.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ንመስርሕ ዘርእታት ምፍጣር ብቕኑዕ ዘይገልጹ ኣየኖት እዮም? ,"The correct answer is **D: ፍጻሜኡ ዘይተርፍ እዩ (It doesn't have a final outcome).**

Here's why:

The passage describes speciation as the *creation of new species*. It emphasizes that this process leads to highly diverse organisms that cannot interbreed. Therefore, speciation *does* have a final outcome – the emergence of distinct, reproductively isolated species.

Let's look at why the other options *are* relevant to speciation:

*   **A: ሓድሽ ህዝቢ ክወሃሃድ ኣብ ዘይክእለሉ እዋን የጋጥም (It occurs when a new population cannot evolve):** This is a key trigger for speciation. When a population becomes isolated and faces different environmental pressures, it can evolve independently.
*   **B: ንመስርሕ ዕብየት ኣገዳሲ መዳይ እዩ (Mutation is a crucial source of variation):** Mutation provides the raw material for evolutionary change. Without variation, speciation cannot occur.
*   **C: ንምምስራት ሓድሽ ዓልየታት ይምልከት (It relates to the formation of new characteristics):** Speciation is fundamentally about the development of new characteristics and traits that distinguish one group from another.

Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the central idea of the passage.

ኣየናይ ክፍሊ ናይ ስርዓት ዙረት ደም እዩ ደም ናብ ልቢ ዘብጽሕ?,"The correct answer is **D: ቨይናት (Veins)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""ደም ካብ ልቢ እቶም ኣርተሪ ዚብሃሉ ቱቦታት ይወጽእ"" which translates to ""Blood comes from the heart through tubes called arteries.""  It also says ""ናብ ልቢ ዚምለስ ከኣ ሰራውር ደም ተባሂል ዚጽዋዕ ቱቦታት እዩ"" which translates to ""And the blood that returns to the heart flows through tubes called veins.""

Therefore, veins are the tubes that carry blood *back* to the heart.
"
ኣብ ስርዓት ዙረት ደም ዝነኣሹ ትቦታት ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **A: ካፒላሪታት (Capillaries)**.

The passage states: ""እቲ ዝነኣሰ ቱቦታት ካፒላሪ ይበሃል。"" which translates to ""The narrowed tubes are called capillaries."" Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels and connect arteries and veins.

Here's why:

The passage states that dragonflies and mayflies are ""habituated"" (habitual) to certain places, meaning they are drawn to specific locations. This habituation is a direct result of those locations providing the resources they need to survive and reproduce.  Therefore, suitable habitats are key to their life cycle.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ቐረብ መግቢ (Nearby Food):** While food is important, the passage doesn't emphasize that proximity to food is *the* reason they inhabit specific places.  It focuses more on the overall habitat suitability.
* **C: ምርካብ መጻምዲ (Complex Vegetation):** Complex vegetation *can* be part of a suitable habitat, but it's not the core reason for the habituation. It's a potential component, not the primary driver.
* **D: ናይ ምህዳም ፍጥነት (Flight Speed):** Flight speed is important for catching prey, but it doesn't explain *why* they are drawn to specific habitats in the first place.

Here's why:

* The passage describes flying insects as creatures that ""ሓሸራ ናብ ኣየር ዝወሰዱ"" (fly into the air). This implies they possess the ability to fly.
* **ምፍራይ (flying)** directly refers to the act of flying.
* **ንዉሓት ሂወት (life's breath)** is a metaphorical term and doesn't describe a specific ability like flying. While insects *are* alive, the text focuses on their *flying* as a key characteristic.
* **ምእካብ መግቢ (finding food)** and **ብቕዓት (skillfully)** describe *what* they do while flying, not the ability of flying itself.

Therefore, ""ንዉሓት ሂወት"" is the only option that doesn't directly relate to the ability of flying mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many birds have characteristics similar to dinosaurs, including:

*   Feathers
*   Beaks
*   Love of chasing
*   Walking on two legs (like a T-Rex)

Dinosaurs are known for walking on two legs. However, **""ዝተጠወየ እግሪ"" (walking on two legs)** is a characteristic *commonly associated with birds*, but **not typically associated with the majority of dinosaurs**.  The passage highlights that birds are descended from dinosaurs, but not all dinosaurs walked bipedally.  Many were quadrupedal (walked on four legs).

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ብልምዲ ከም ናይ ኣዕዋፍን ዳይናሶራትን ሓበራዊ ባህርያት ተባሂሉ ዘይሕሰብ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ክነፍሩ ምኽኣል (Ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions that birds have features similar to dinosaurs, such as beaks, scales, a keen sense of smell, and some even have two legs like a T-Rex. 

While the other options are related to dinosaur/bird characteristics:

*   **A: ምጽፋይ እንቛቕሖ (Being able to sing/call out):** This is a social behavior found in birds.
*   **B: ንምኻድ ክልተ ናይ ድሕሪት-እግሪ ምጥቓም (Walking on two legs):**  Some dinosaurs, like T-Rex, walked on two legs, and this is also found in birds.
*   **D: ጠዋይ እግሪ (Beak):** Beaks are a characteristic shared by birds and dinosaurs.

**However, the ability to fly (ክነፍሩ ምኽኣል) is a unique and defining feature of birds that is *not* generally considered a social behavior or a common characteristic shared by *all* dinosaurs.** While some dinosaurs might have glided or had feathers for insulation, powered flight is primarily a bird characteristic. Therefore, it's the answer that best fits the question of what isn't typically categorized as a social behavior or common trait shared by both birds and dinosaurs.

The text states that some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, which are like poisonous, chewy pinecones. It also mentions that other animals *can* eat poisonous plants and fruits.  Therefore, a poisonous fruit-bearing plant is the most likely thing a Triceratops might have eaten, based on the information given.

The text states: "" ኣብ ኤውሮጳ ድማ 23,764 ትርብዒት ኪሎ ሜትር እዩ"" which translates to ""In Europe also, it is 23,764 square kilometers.""  This refers to the area of Turkey that lies in Europe.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ቱርኪ ክንደይ ዝኣክል ስፍሓት ኣለዋ?,"The correct answer is **B: 9174**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ካብዚ ድማ 755,688 ትርብዒት ኪሎ ሜተር (291,773 ትርብዒት ሚኢ) ኣብ ደቡባዊ ምዕራብ እስያ ኣብ ኤውሮጳ ድማ 23,764 ትርብዒት ኪሎ ሜተር እዩ"" which translates to ""Of this, 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) are in South-Western Asia and 23,764 square kilometers are in Europe.""

Adding those two together (755,688 + 23,764 = 779,452), and then considering the total area of Turkey mentioned later (300,948 square miles), the closest answer among the choices is **9174** square miles. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided in the text. It is likely there is a typo in the multiple-choice options.

However, if we are forced to choose from the given options, **B: 9174** is the most plausible answer considering the provided context, although it's not directly stated as the total area. The numbers 1600, 500, and 1000 don't correspond to any area mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

The passage describes a creature (the ""slithering thing"") that moves in a slippery substance (the ""slippery thing"").  The key is that the passage states: ""እቲ ኽልተ ጫፍ ዋላ እውን ቀኒኑ እንተዀነ ነቲ በረድ ብዝሓሸ መገዲ ንኽንርድኦ የኽእለና ። ታሕተዋይ ክፋል እቲ ብልሒ ቝሩብ ስለ እተጠዋወየ እቲ ብልሒ ናብ ሓደ ሸነኽ ወይ ናብቲ ኻልእ ሸነኽ ኪዘውር ከሎ እቲ ምስ በረድ ዚራኸብ ጫፍ እውን ይጥወ እዩ。ዚ ኸኣ ነቲ ቐስ እናበለ ኸም ዚዘውር ይገብሮ。"" (If both ends are pulled, we can easily pull the creature. The lower part, because the liquid is close, when the liquid moves towards one side or the other, the end connected to the creature also turns and it moves like a snake.)

This directly links the movement of the two ends of the creature to its slithering motion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ንእሽተይ ምጥዋይ ኣብ ድሕሪት ናይቲ መንሸራተቲ በሊሕ ነገር (The small bite after the slippery thing):** The passage doesn't mention a ""bite.""
* **C: ናይቲ ዘንሸራትት ሓፈሻዊ ናይ ክእለት ደረጃኡ (The morphological level of the slithering thing's ability):** While the ability to slither is mentioned, the passage doesn't focus on the morphological level of that ability.
* **D: ብቕዓት ናይቲ በረድ (The intensity of the creature's life):**  The passage describes the creature's movement, not its intensity of life.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ኣቶም ካብ ብርሃን ተረፍ ጽዓት ከዉጽእ ዘኽእሎ መስርሕ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ዝተነቓቕሐ ምዉጻእ ፎቶናት (Exciton)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes how light energy is absorbed by atoms and creates something called an ""exciton.""
* It states that excitons are formed by the absorption of ""ፎቶን"" (photons) and are a type of ""ዜነቓቕሕ ጸርጊ"" (exciton).
* The passage explicitly says ""ነዚ ድማ """"ፎተን"""" ዝበሃል ንእሽቶ ንጥረ-ነገር ብርሃን ብምውጻእ ኢዮም ዝገብሩ"" - this refers to the process of light being absorbed by a small particle called a photon, which then creates an exciton.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጨረርታ (Light):** While light is the initial energy source, the question asks about the *mechanism* by which atoms absorb light and convert it.
* **C: ፎቶን (Photon):** Photons are individual packets of light energy, but the question is about what *atoms* create after absorbing light.
* **D: ዝተነቓቕሐ ምዉጻእ ናይ ጨረርታ (Exciton of light):** While technically correct in that excitons *are* related to light, option B is more precise and describes the *process* of exciton formation.

Therefore, **B: ዝተነቓቕሐ ምዉጻእ ፎቶናት (Exciton)** is the best answer because it directly reflects the information presented in the passage about how atoms absorb light and create excitons."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ተመራመርቲ ስነ ፍልጠት ኣቶማት በቲ ድሙቕ ብርሃን ስለ ዚነቓቕሑ ፎቶፎን ብርሃን ከም ዚወጽእ ስለ ዚገብር ብርሃን ከኣ ሓደ ዓይነት ጸርጊ ስለ ዝዀነ ነዚ መስርሕ እዚ """"ዜነቓቕሕ ጸርጊ"""" ኢሎም እዮም ዚጽውዕዎ.""  This translates to: ""Scientists, because atoms are excited by dim light, emit photons of light, and because light is a type of energy, they call this process ""excited energy"".""

The passage then says: ""እቲ ቐጺሉ ዘሎ ስእሊ እቶም ፎቶናት ዜውጽኡ ኣቶማት ይሕብር። ከም ሓቂ ግና ፎቶናት ካብቲ ኣብዚ ስእሊ ዘሎ ኣዝዩ ዝነኣሰ እዩ ። ፎቶናት ካብቶም ንኣትማት ዝፈጠሩ ነገራት እውን ዝነኣሱ እዮም።"" Which translates to: ""The subsequent result is that atoms emit photons. However, photons are very energetic. Photons are also energetic from things that create atoms.""

This indicates that photons are created when atoms are excited by dim light. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ተረፍ ጽዓት ንምዉጻእ (Emitting electrons)**: The passage focuses on photons, not electrons.
* **C: ዘይርጉእ ናይ ጽዓት ደረጃታት (Non-radiative energy levels)**:  While energy levels are involved, the passage focuses on the *emission* of energy in the form of photons.
* **D: ጎናዊ ሳዕቤን ንጨረርታ (Rotating side-angles)**: This is unrelated to the passage's discussion of photons and atomic excitation.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ኣምፑል ናይ ልቺ ምስራሕ ተቓርጸሉ ምኽንያት እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: እቲ ናይ ኣምፑል ሓጺናዊ ጫፍ ናብ ሶኬት ምሉእ ዘይምእታዉ (The short part of the bulb doesn't fully contact the socket).**

The text explicitly states: ""ከምዚ ኪኸውን ዝኸኣለ ኤለክትሪክ ናብቲ ብብረት እተሰርሐ ኽፋል ኽልል ኣምፑል ኮፍ ዚብለሉ ሶኬት ስለ ዚውሕዝ ንውሽጣዊ ኽፋል እታ ኣምፑል ወይ ነቲ ብሓጺን እተሰርሐ ኣምፑል ብእተወሰነ ኽፋል እቲ ሶኬት ኽትትንክፎ ኸለኻ ብርቱዕ ኤለክትሪክ ክሕዘካ ስለ ዚኽእል እዩ."" (This happens because the socket, which is made of metal, has a short part. If the bulb, or the short part of the bulb, doesn't fully contact the socket, it can cause a powerful electric shock.)

Options A, C, and D are not directly supported by the text.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣምፑል ናይ ልቺ ኣብ እትቕይረሉ ግዜ ሓደገኛ ክኸዉን ዝኽእል ነገር ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: እቲ ገመድ (The cord)**.

Here's why:

* **The explanation in the P section specifically mentions the cord/wire as the most likely culprit.** It states that a loose connection or frayed cord can cause excessive electricity to flow and potentially lead to a hazard.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely (though not entirely impossible in other scenarios):

* **A: እቲ ስልኪ (The socket):** While a faulty socket *can* be dangerous, the explanation focuses more on the connection *within* the socket and the light bulb itself.
* **B: እቲ መወልዒ መጥፊኢ (The switch):** A switch malfunction is possible, but the description points to a problem in the light bulb's connection to the socket.
* **C: ጫፍ ናይቲ ኣምፑል (The bulb end):** A broken bulb end is less likely to cause a *dangerous* electrical situation unless it creates an extremely short circuit.

**Therefore, based on the information provided in the P section, the cord is the most hazardous component when changing a light bulb.**"

This implies that protons are involved in the fusion process.

The text also mentions: ""ኒኩለስ መሊስካ ምብታን እውን ጉልበት ይለቅቕ እዩ。"" which translates to ""The nucleus also releases energy when it splits.""  This is related to nuclear fission, not fusion.  

The other options are not directly supported by the text.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ናይ ነዊሕ ርሕቐት ጻዊዒት ናብ ዓለም ዘንጸባርቑ ኣየኖት እዮም,"The correct answer is **B: ሳተላይታት (Satellites)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""እታ ኣብ ህዋ ዘላ ሳተላይት ደዊላ ብቕጽበት ንድሕሪት ከም እትምለስ ትገብራ"" (The satellite in space quickly reflects the light).  This directly connects satellites to space exploration and advancements.
* **The passage mentions satellites being launched by rockets:** ""ሳተላይት ወይ ተለስኮፕ ኣብ ህዋ ንምእታው ልዕሊ 100 ሜትሮ ብራኸ ዘለዎ ገዚፍ ሮኬት የድሊ"" (Satellites or telescopes are launched into space by powerful rockets).
* **The passage describes telescopes as tools used in space:**  ""...ተመራመርቲ ስነ ፍልጠት ኣብ ህዋ ተለስኮፕ ይጥቀሙ እዮም።"" (...scientists use telescopes in space.)

While telescopes and rockets are important, the passage focuses on satellites as a key advancement in space exploration and a tool for observation. The question asks for the *newest* form of high technology that has reached the world. Satellites represent a significant technological leap forward.

Therefore, **Satellites** (ሳተላይታት) is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ሳተላይት ወይ ተለስኮፕ ኣብ ህዋ ንምእታው ልዕሊ 100 ሜትሮ ብራኸ ዘለዎ ገዚፍ ሮኬት የድሊ።"" which translates to ""A satellite or telescope is launched into space by a powerful rocket over 100 meters tall.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ብርሃን ብዙሓት ጩራታት (Many light spectra):** While telescopes *observe* light spectra, light spectra themselves are not what launch telescopes into space.
*   **C: ናይ መሬት ሃዋሁ (Earth's gravity):** Earth's gravity is what *keeps* things on Earth, and the rocket has to overcome it to reach space.
*   **D: ልዕሊ 100 ፊት ንዉሓት ዘለዎም ሳተላይታት (Satellites over 100 feet tall):**  While the text mentions satellites, it's the *rockets* that launch them. The size of the satellite is irrelevant to the launch method.

ምሕላፍ ግዜ ንምምዝጋብ ኣየናይ ናይ ዑደት ፍጻሜ እዩ ኣብ ትሕቲ ግዛቤ ክመጽእ ዘለዎ?,"The correct answer is **A: ንውሓት ግዜ (change)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ጊዜ እውን ናይ ኩነታት ንውሓት ግዜ ነነፃፅረሉ እዩ። እቲ ዝሓልፍ ዘሎ ጊዜ በቶም ዝካየዱ ዘለው ኩነታት ብምዕዛብ ምልክት ምግባር ይካኣል እዩ። ብዑደት ዝፍፀሙ ዘለው ኩነታት በቢ ግዚኡ ተደጋጊሞም ዝፍጠሩ እዮም።""

Translation: ""Time also adapts to change in circumstances. The passing of time can be indicated by the signs of changes that occur. Circumstances that occur over a long period of time often create themselves.""

This clearly indicates that change is what time adapts to. Therefore, ""ንውሓት ግዜ"" (change) is the correct answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ምድግጋም (reproduction)** - The text doesn't link time to reproduction.
*   **C: ጽልዋ (suffering)** - The text doesn't directly relate time to suffering.
*   **D: ጸገም (problem)** - While problems can be part of change, the text focuses on time adapting to change in circumstances more broadly.

The text states: ""ጊዜ እውን ናይ ኩነታት ንውሓት ግዜ ነነፃፅረሉ እዩ"" which translates to ""Time also regulates the time of change of circumstances."" 

Therefore, according to the text, time is a way of expressing change.

Here's why:

* The text states that Charles was the first undergraduate member of the Royal Family to achieve a first-class degree. 
* A 2:2 degree is considered a lower-level degree compared to a first-class degree.
* The text explicitly mentions Charles *didn't* follow the typical path of going straight to the Royal Household after school, attending university and earning a degree first.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ናብ ዉትህድርና ንምጽንባር ዩኒቪሲቲ ምዉጻእ (Going to university before joining the Royal Household):** The text highlights that Charles *did* go to university before joining the Royal Household, making this a typical (though not immediately followed) path.
* **C: ታሪኽ ምጽናዕ (Studying History):** The text mentions Charles studied History, but this isn't something that would be considered *not* a typical aspect of the Royal Family's tradition.
* **D: ቅድሚ ናብ ዉትህድርና ምኻድ ናብ ዩኒቨርሲቲ (Going to university before joining the Royal Household):** As explained above, Charles *did* go to university.

Here's why:

The passage states: "" ኣብኡ ኸኣ ብዛዕባ ስነ ሰብን ስነ-ጥንቲን መጽናዕቲ ገበረ..."" (There he studied humanities and history...).  This indicates that studying history was one of his primary activities while at Trinity College. While the other options are true statements about Charles, they aren't the *first* thing the passage focuses on. The passage prioritizes his academic pursuits at the college.

The early 15th century is approximately 600-800 years ago. Therefore, the closest and most accurate answer is D.
"

The text explicitly states: "" ኣብ ፊደላት ጀርመን እተመስረተ ዀይኑ """"Õ/õ"""" ዚብል ሓደ ገጸ-ባህርይ ተወሰኸ"" which translates to ""Based on German letters, one characteristic was adopted: the """"Õ/õ"""" character.""  This is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text.

While options B (German words) and C (German influence) are true, they are consequences of the adoption of the Õ/õ character, not the primary reason for the language's divergence. Option D (God) is irrelevant to the linguistic development described.

Here's why:

The text states: "" ኣብ ፈለማ ፊደላት ሃንጉል ሃንሚን ዦንጁም ኢሉ ሰመዮ፣ ትርጕሙ ኸኣ """"ንትምህርቲ እቲ ህዝቢ ዚኸውን ቅኑዕ ደሃይ"""" ማለት እዩ።""  This translates to: ""Initially, the Hangul alphabet was called Hunmin Jeongeum, whose meaning is 'the proper way to teach the people, who are ignorant.'""

Option B claims the original name was Hunan Jeongeum. The text explicitly states the name was Hangul Hunmin Jeongeum. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

Here's why the other options are correct:

* **A: ኣብ መጀመርታ ዘመን ናይ ንጉስ ሳጆንግ ተረኽበ (It was discovered in the early reign of King Sejong):** The text states King Sejong (the 4th Joseon king) commissioned its creation.
* **C: በቲ ራብዓይ ንጉስ ብንግስነት ጆሶን ተፈጥረ (It was created by the 4th king in the Joseon dynasty):**  The text says it was created during King Sejong's reign, who was the 4th king of Joseon.
* **D: ብዕላማ ተፈጥረ (It was created with a purpose):** The text states the purpose was to ""teach the people, who are ignorant.""



Therefore, the answer is **B**.

The text states that Sanskrit is the ancestor of many languages, including those of Europe like Latin, and that it's considered the origin of powerful modern languages of India.  Therefore, the languages derived from Sanskrit are Indo-European languages.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ጥቕሚ ናይ ሳንስክሪት ብሰንኪ እንታይ ጎዲሉ?,"The correct answer is **D: ደረጃ (Status)**.

This indicates that Sanskrit's status as a rich and influential language is what contributes to its longevity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምስቕልቕል (Migration)** - While the migration of the Aryans is mentioned as a historical context, it's not the reason for Sanskrit's longevity.
*   **B: ስደት ናይ ኣርያን (Aryan Migration)** - Same reason as above.
*   **C: ቛንቛታት ላቲን (Latin Languages)** - The passage compares Sanskrit to Latin-derived languages to highlight its richness, but it doesn't say Latin languages *caused* Sanskrit's longevity.

Therefore, the passage emphasizes Sanskrit's high **status** as a rich and influential language as the reason for its durability."

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ስሕበት ኢዮ ብኸመይ እዩ ዚጐትተኒ? ኣብ ገጽ ኢዮ ደው እንተ ኢልካ ካብቲ ኣብ ምድሪ ዘሎካ ዝወሓደ ኽብደት ምሃለወካ"" which translates to ""How does gravity pull on me? When you call out on the surface, it's because the weight from what is on Earth is pulling you.""
* The passage then uses the example of 90 pounds on Earth being equivalent to 16 kilograms on Io to illustrate that the *weight* isn't significantly different; the *gravity* is what's pulling.
* Options B and C incorrectly claim the gravity on Io is stronger, leading to a heavier weight. The passage contradicts this.
* Option D is also incorrect, stating that the gravity on Io is stronger than on Earth. The passage implies the gravity is similar, just a different source.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""ላዕላዋይ ሽፋን ከውሒ ክረስት ይበሃል።"" (The upper layer is called the crust).
* **The text further states:** ""እቲ ቅርፍቲ ብቀረባ ናይ ኣስታት 70 ኪሜ፣ ኣብ ርሑቕ ድማ 100 ኪሜ ርጉዲ ኣለዎ。"" (The crust is about 70 km thick nearby, and 100 km thick further away).
* **This implies:** The crust forms a surrounding layer (or ""ሸነኽ"" - surrounding) that is relatively low in thickness (compared to the overall size).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ መሸፈኒ ኣብ ትሕቲ እቲ ላዕለዋይ መሬት ዝቐጠነ እዩ (The crust is located beneath the upper ground).**  The text says the crust *is* the upper layer (""ላዕላዋይ ሽፋን""), not something beneath it.
* **C: ናብቲ ዝረሓቐ ወገን ዉሑድ ኮኾብ ናይ ባሕሪ ክህልዉ ይኽእል እዩ (Low-lying marine stars can be found on the far side).** The text doesn't mention anything about marine stars or the far side of the moon.
* **D: ኣብ ትሕቲ እቲ ላዕለዋይ መሬት ዉሑድ ኮኾብ ናይ ባሕሪ ክህልዉ ይኽእል እዩ (Low-lying marine stars can be found beneath the upper ground).** Same reason as C - no mention of marine stars.



Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the information in the text."

The text states: ""እቲ ክረስት ዝቐጠነ ብምዃኑ ኣብቲ ዝቐረበ ቦታ ዝበዝሐ ማሪያ ክህሉ ይኽእል"" which translates to ""Because the crust is well-preserved, a lot of maria can be seen in the closer area."" 

Therefore, the lunar surface region that was covered by the crust is the closer area.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the *desire* and *imagination* of humans to explore other worlds.** It states that many people dream of traveling to other planets and imagining what they would find.  This highlights their *ability to envision* and *believe* in such exploration.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ደቒ ሰባት ናብ ካልኦት ኮዋኽብቲ ተጓዒዞም እዮም (Humans have traveled to other planets):** The passage focuses on *future aspirations* and *thoughts*, not past achievements.  It says travel has been ""rare.""
* **C: ኣብ ካልኦት ፕላኔታት ሂወት ኣሎ (Life exists on other planets):**  The passage mentions the *possibility* of life but doesn't explicitly state that people *believe* life exists. It leans more towards the *potential*.
* **D: ኣብ መንጎ ከዋኽብቲ ትሕቲ ትሪልዮን ማይላት ርሕቐት ኣሎ (There is a distance of trillions of miles between stars):** While this is a factual detail in the passage, it's not about what people *believe* or *imagine*.  It's just a descriptive fact.



Therefore, option B best captures the focus of the passage on human *belief* in and *capacity* for exploration."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ብምልእታ ጸሓይ ካብ ጋዛትን ሓውን ፕላዝማን እያ እትሰርሐት"" which translates to ""In its fullness, the sun emits gas, wind, and plasma.""  It then goes on to say that as the sun contracts, the gas becomes more dense. Therefore, the answer is gas.

Here's why:

* **Copernicus's heliocentric theory** proposed that the planets revolved around the Sun. 
* **Phases of Venus** are only possible if Venus orbits the Sun, just like the Moon orbits the Earth.  If Venus orbited the Earth (as in the geocentric model), it would always appear as a crescent.
* The observation of Venus exhibiting phases (like the Moon) provided strong evidence **supporting Copernicus's heliocentric model** and challenging the prevailing geocentric view.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምስግጋር ናይ ቬኑስ (Eclipses of Venus)**: While Venus *can* eclipse the Sun, this doesn't directly confirm Copernicus's theory. Eclipses could occur in either a geocentric or heliocentric system.
* **C: ናይ ጸሓይ ተመሳሰልነት ምስ ቬኑስ (Similarities of Venus to the Sun)**: Venus is *not* similar to the Sun. The Sun is a star and vastly larger and hotter than Venus.
* **D: ናይ ጸሓይ ተመሳሰልነት ምስ ወርሒ (Similarities of Venus to the Moon)**:  The similarity of Venus's phases to the Moon was crucial, but the *reason* for those phases – Venus orbiting the Sun –  was the key point supporting Copernicus.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Galileo observed the phases of Venus in 1610, which are only possible if Venus orbits the Sun.
* Option A (phases of the moon) is mentioned as a point of comparison *to* the phases of Venus, but not what Galileo directly observed.
* Option C (planet orbiting the sun) is a broader concept that Galileo's observations of Venus helped support, but it's not the specific observation he made in 1610.
* Option D (clouds of Venus) is not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting Galileo's 1610 discovery is the phases of Venus."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ፈለግ ኣማዞን ማይ ካበይ ይእክብ?,"The correct answer is **A: ንኣሽቱ ኣፍላጋት (Ninety-nine rivers)**.

The text states: ""ካብ ኣሽሓት ኣናእሽተይ ሩባታት እዩ ማዩ ዝእክብ"" which translates to ""It is drained by about sixty thousand rivers"".  The options don't directly say ""sixty thousand rivers,"" but ""ንኣሽቱ ኣፍላጋት"" (ninety-nine rivers) is the closest and most accurate interpretation of the original text. The text explicitly mentions it drains through numerous rivers.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: እቲ ዝነዉሐ ፈለግ (The first river)** - The text mentions the Amazon is the largest, but doesn't say it's draining *only* the first river.
*   **C: እቶም ዉቃንዮሳት (The oceans)** - While the text says 20% of ocean water comes from the Amazon, it doesn't state the Amazon *drains* the oceans.
*   **D: እቲ ካልኣይ ዝዓበየ ፈለግ (The second river)** - The text refers to the Amazon as the *largest* river, not the second.

ኣየናይ ስያመ እዩ ንፈለግ ኣማዞን ዘይተወሃበ?,"The correct answer is **C: እቲ ዝነዉሐ ፈለግ እዩ** (The third largest river it is).

The passage explicitly states: ""ናይ አማዞን ፈለግ ካልኣይ እቲ ዝነዉሐ ከምኡውን ኣብልዕሊ ምድሪ ዝዓበየ ፈለግ እዩ。"" which translates to ""The Amazon River is the second longest river and the river that flows over land.""  Therefore, it is the third longest *river* overall (since the Nile is longer).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ ካልኣይ ዝነዉሐ ፈለግ እዩ (The second longest river it is):**  The passage states it's the *second* longest *in terms of flowing over land*, but it's the *third* longest overall.
* **B: እቲ ዝዓበየ ፈለግ እዩ (The flowing river it is):** While true, this is a general description and not the specific answer to what river Amazon *isn't*.
* **D: እቲ ዝሰፍሐ ፈለግ እዩ (The created river it is):** The Amazon is a naturally formed river; it wasn't ""created.""

Here's why:

The text states: ""ክልተ ሲሶ ኻብቨነዝወላውያን ኣብ ክፍሊ ኣገልግሎት እዮም ዚሰርሑ ፣ እዚ ኸኣ ዳርጋ ርብዒ ኣብ ኢንዱስትሪ ሓምሻይ ከኣ ኣብ ሕርሻ እዩ።"" This translates to: ""Two thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector, and a quarter in industry and in agriculture.""

Therefore, agriculture is one of the sectors mentioned as having Venezuelan workers. The other options (Industry, Oil, and Services) are also mentioned, but the question asks for a *line* representing the proportion of Venezuelans working in a *specific* sector.  The text directly states that a quarter (which is 25%) of Venezuelans work in agriculture. While the other options have proportions, the agriculture sector is explicitly mentioned as having a significant, though smaller than the service sector, presence.

Since the question asks for the sector directly mentioned as having Venezuelan workers, and agriculture is listed as one of them, and industry and oil are not explicitly stated as sectors having Venezuelan workers, **Agriculture (ሕርሻ)** is the most accurate answer.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ካብ ቨነዝወላውያን ዓሰርተ ሸሞንተ ሚእታዊት ስራሕ ዘይብሎም ኢዮም መብዛሕትኦም ከኣ ኣብ ዘይወግዓዊ ቝጠባ ኢዮም ዝሰርሑ። ክልተ ሲሶ ኻብቨነዝወላውያን ኣብ ክፍሊ ኣገልግሎት እዮም ዚሰርሑ...""

This translates to: ""More than 80% of Venezuelans are unemployed, and many of them are working in the informal sector. Two-thirds of Venezuelans are working in the service sector...""

Therefore, the largest proportion of Venezuelans working in the informal sector, according to the text, is in the **service sector (ኣገልጉሎት)**.



While the text mentions work in agriculture (ሕርሻ), industry (ኢንዱስትሪ), and the oil industry (ዘይቲ), it explicitly states that *two-thirds* are in the service sector. The other options are not stated as the largest group."

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ከበድቲ ባእታታት ይፈጥሩ (They create heavier stars):** While fusion *can* lead to heavier elements, the text focuses on the immediate emission of light and heat from the hydrogen fusion process.
* **B: ምዉህሃድ ናይ ተቓመምቲ ይሃንጽ (Fusion creates compounds):**  The text doesn't specifically say fusion creates compounds, although it *can* be a precursor to the formation of heavier elements. The primary focus is on light and heat.
* **D: ሃይድሮጅን ኣቶማታት ይፈጥር (It creates hydrogen atoms):** Fusion is the *process* of combining hydrogen atoms, not creating them.



"

Here's why:

The text discusses stars producing energy through nuclear fusion, specifically by combining hydrogen atoms. Scientists are trying to replicate this process on Earth to create a fusion reactor. Therefore, hydrogen is the key element in the fusion process being discussed.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ከዋኽብቲ (Stars):** Stars *are* where this process happens, but the question asks for the fuel used in the process.
*   **C: ኣቶማት (Atoms):** While atoms are involved, the question is more specific about the *type* of atom.
*   **D: ጽዓት (Heat):** Heat is a byproduct of the process, not the fuel itself.

The passage states that water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Regardless of its physical state (gas, liquid, or solid), each compound has the same molecular structure. Water is an example: it is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""

* **This means:** The arrangement of the atoms (the molecular structure) remains the same, regardless of whether water is in liquid form (water) or solid form (ice).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጻዕቒ (Density):** Density changes with physical state.
* **C: ኣካላዊ ኩነታት (Physical state):**  The question asks what *doesn't* change. The passage explicitly states that the compound *has* different physical states.
* **D: ፈሳሲ ናይትሮጅን (Liquid nitrogen):** This is a specific example of a physical state and doesn't represent a general property that remains constant.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the central government lacked the power to make national decisions.  It highlights that the member states often acted independently and didn't want to cede power to the central government.  This lack of a national decision-making authority is a key problem described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ካብ ሰበ-ስልጣናት ግዝኣት ከቢድ ዘይምቕላብ (Severe lack of accountability from the sub-states):** While accountability was a problem, the passage focuses more on the *lack of power* of the central government and the *reluctance of the states to delegate*.
* **B: ኣብ ዉሽጢ ጉባኤ ሓይሊ ዘይምህላዉ (Lack of power within the assembly):** The passage doesn't focus on power dynamics *within* the central government's assembly.
* **C: ምምሕያሻት ምሉእ ፍቓድ ስምምዕ ዝሓትት (Demand for full consent in all transactions):**  While a demand for consent existed, the core issue outlined in the passage is the inability of the central government to *make decisions at all*, not just the requirement for consent.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the central government lacked the power to enact laws directly. Instead, laws were enacted by the assemblies of the constituent states and by the local authorities within those states.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ናይቶም ዓንቐጻት ምምሕያሻት ኣብ ስልጣን ናይ ጉባኤ ዝተመርኮሱ ነበሩ (The amendments of the states were based on the power of the assembly).** While assemblies *did* have power, the text emphasizes the *lack* of a unified system for amending laws across all states.
* **C: ናይ ግዝኣት ወኪላት ህላዉነት ኣይነበሮምን (There were no delegates of the executive branch).** The text mentions that the constituent states sent representatives to the central government, even if they didn't always cooperate.
* **D: ማእከላዊ መንግስቲ ክልተ ዓበይቲ ክፋላት ዝሓዘ ነበረ (The central government had two parts).** The text indicates a lack of structure within the central government itself, not a division into two parts.

This implies the text was written in a large, decorative, and somewhat mysterious font, not a clear or obvious one. Therefore, ""ብምስጢራዊ"" (mysterious) is the most appropriate description.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሲንጋፖር ትፍለጠሉ ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **B: ምሕዃር (Agriculture)**.

The text states that Singapore, when it began its independence, was an agricultural island. It then transitioned to a tropical city-state, but its initial identity was agriculture. The text mentions the adoption of Vanda Miss Joaquim as the national flower, which is a plant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ከተማ ልሙዕ ቦታ (Urban center):** While Singapore is now a major urban center, the text focuses on its agricultural past.
*   **C: ኣዘናጋዕቲ ስፖርትታት (Relaxing sports):** This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: ምርኢት ስነ-ጥበብ (Artistic masterpiece):** While Singapore has a thriving art scene, the text does not focus on it.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **Agriculture (ምሕዃር)**.
"

The text states that Vanda Miss Joaquim is a orchid and was chosen as the national flower of Singapore in 1981. Therefore, it is a flower.

Here's why:

The passage states that while the pyramids of Giza remain impressive, their *method of construction* is not well understood, even though ancient Egyptians have been studying them for over 1000 years. This implies a lack of understanding regarding the *technical prowess* used to build them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዕድሚኦም (Age):** The passage doesn't question the age of the pyramids.
* **C: ዓቐኖም (Significance/Importance):** The passage explicitly states the pyramids are impressive, so they are still significant.
* **D: ትሕተ ቕርጾም (Their shapes):** The passage doesn't mention any issues with the shape of the pyramids.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ኣብ ከባቢ ምያዝያ በላዕቲ ኣትክልቲ ካበየናይ ቦታ ይፈናቐሉ?,"The correct answer is **A: እቲ ከባቢ ሰረንግቲ (The Serengeti area)**.

The passage states: ""ድሕሪኡ ኣብ ከባቢ ሚያዝያ ዝናም ምስ ዘነመ እንደገና ንፈለግ ማራ ሰጊርካ ብሸነኽ ምዕራብ ናብ ሰሜን ተመለስ"" which translates to ""Afterwards, when the rains came in the area of Myaazya, the wildebeest migrated again, followed by the wildebeests, heading north.""

The question asks where the wildebeest gather in the Myaazya area. The text explicitly mentions that the wildebeest gather in the Serengeti area during the rains. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"
ስርሒት ሳሊዮን ናየናይ ሃገር ወራር ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **B: ብሪጣንያ (Britain)**.

The text states that the ""Operation Seelöwe"" (Operation Sea Lion) was Germany's plan to invade **Britain** after the war in France.

The text explicitly states: ""ጀርመን ነቲ መጥቃዕቲ """"ኦፐሬሽን ሲ ሊዮን"""" ኢላ ሰመየቶ"" which translates to ""Germany called the offensive """"Operation Sealion"""""".  The passage then goes on to describe the planned invasion of Britain under this operation.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""በዚ ምኽንያት እዚ ነቲ ኣብ ግብጺ ዝነበረ መሰረታትን መራኽብን ብሪጣንያ ኼወግድዎ ነበሮ። ኣብ ርእሲ እዚ ተግባራት እዚ እተን ኣብ ኢጣልያ ዝነበራ መራኽብ ውግእ ካልእ ነገር ኪገብራ ኣይነበራን ። ሕጂ ናብ ጃፓን ። ጃፓን ልክዕ ከም ብሪጣንያ ደሴት እያ ነይራ።"" which translates to: ""For this reason, this led to attacking the facilities and ships in Egypt which Britain had established. The head of these operations was the ship in Italy, and nothing else overshadowed it. Now to Japan. Japan is like Britain an island.""

Therefore, the primary focus of Italy's naval strategy for invading Africa was to target and neutralize British assets in Egypt, specifically their ships and facilities. The other options are not directly mentioned as key components of Italy's African invasion strategy in this passage.

The passage states: ""ቀንዲ ሸቶታት ኢጣልያ ሃገራት ኣፍሪቃ እየን ነይረን። ናዘን ሃገራት እዚኣተን ንምሓዝ ወተሃደራት ንባሕሪ መዲተራነያን ሰጊሮም ንኣፍሪቃ ምእንቲ ኽወርርወን ናይ ወተሃደራት መጕተቲ ቦታ የድልዮም ነበረ።""

This translates to: ""The main goals of Italy were the conquest of African countries. To conquer those countries, the navy was being secured with Mediterranean ships, and a base for naval operations in Africa was needed.""

While options B, C, and D are mentioned as *means* to achieve Italian goals, the fundamental aim stated is the conquest of African countries. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.

ምስ ገዛእቲ ምሕዝነታዊ ርክባት ዝመስረተ መን ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **B: ቪኪ ፈረንሳዉያን (Vichy Frenchmen)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: "" ኣብ ትሕቲ ግዝኣት እቶም """"ቪቺ """" ፈረንሳይኛ ዝነበሩ ሰባት እዩ ነይሩ ።"" (Under the rule of the ""Vichy"" French people they were.) It further describes the Vichy French as those who collaborated with the Germans and viewed the invaders as liberators. This establishes a close and collaborative relationship between the Vichy French and the Germans.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እቶም ጀርመናዉያን (The Germans)**: While they were the occupying force, the question asks who the Vichy French had a *close, collaborative relationship* with.
*   **C: ኣሜሪካዉያን (The Americans)**: The Americans arrived later to liberate the South of France, not to establish a close relationship with the Vichy regime.
*   **D: ነጻ ፈረንሳዉያን (The Free French)**: The Free French were fighting *against* the Vichy regime and their collaboration with the Germans.

Therefore, the Vichy French had the closest, collaborative relationship with the Germans."

* **Propellers (ምንስፋፍ)** are the devices that provide the thrust necessary for a submarine to move through the water. While other technologies aided submarines, the propeller was fundamental to their ability to submerge and navigate underwater.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ዩ-ጃልባታት (U-boats):** U-boats were a *type* of submarine, not a technological advancement enabling them to move underwater.
* **B: ናይ ምቱካስ ርሕቐት (Communication systems):**  Communication systems were important for coordinating submarine operations, but not for propulsion or underwater movement.
* **D: ራዳር (Radar):** Radar is used for detecting objects *above* the water, not for propulsion or maneuvering *under* the water.

The other options are not relevant to the context:

*   **A: ምንስፋፍ (Spreading/Dispersing)** - Doesn't describe what a submarine does.
*   **C: ምቱካስ (Sinking)** - While submarines can sink, the text focuses on their ability to *submerge* and stay underwater.
*   **D: ዕዬአን (Visibility)** - Visibility is not the key function described.

The passage states that the Polish defenders were pushed forward, and the Soviet Red Army entered Romania. The entire context is about the invasion and occupation of Poland by the Soviet Union and its allies. Therefore, the Polish people were the ones facing the conflict and being displaced.

Here's why:

* **The Red Army's actions in 1939 involved:**
    * **Formation of the Ukrainian People's Republic:** The Red Army supported the creation of this state.
    * **Liberation of territories:**  The Red Army liberated parts of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine.
    * **Repeated negotiations:**  There were ongoing negotiations related to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the division of Poland.

* **Re-establishment in a territorial location** isn't a direct action of the Red Army in 1939. While territories were *liberated* and *re-established* under Soviet control, the phrase ""re-establishment in a territorial location"" is too broad and doesn't describe a specific Red Army operation or outcome of the events described in the question.

The other options are all directly related to the Red Army's actions in 1939:

* **Formation of the Ukrainian People's Republic:** The Red Army helped create this.
* **Liberation of territories:** The Red Army liberated parts of Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine.
* **Repeated negotiations:** The Red Army was involved in talks about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the division of Poland.

The text explicitly states: "" ኣብ ኩንዳሊኒ ዮጋ፣ እቲ ኩንዳሊኒ ሓይሊ(መነቓቅሒ ሓይሊ) ብመንገዲ ዮጋ፣ **ናይ ምስትንፋስ ምንቅስቃሳት**، ማንትራን ምስልታት ምቕራጽን ይበራበር"" (In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through Yoga, **through breathing exercises**, chanting mantras, and visualizations).

While options B, C, and D are all elements of Tibetan practice, the text highlights breath control as a *specific* and *important* part of Kundalini Yoga, which is a key component of Tibetan spiritual yoga as described in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states: "" ኣብ ኩንዳሊኒ ዮጋ፣ እቲ ኩንዳሊኒ ሓይሊ(መነቓቅሒ ሓይሊ) ብመንገዲ ዮጋ፣ **ናይ ምስትንፋስ ምንቅስቃሳት**، ማንትራን ምስልታት ምቕራጽን ይበራበር"" (In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (power of awakening) is awakened through Yoga, **through breath practices**, chanting mantras, and meditation).

The passage also mentions that the central practice of Tibetan Buddhism is divine Yoga, involving visualizations of deities, purification of channels, stimulating the chakras, and creating clarity of the mind. Breath control is a core component of Kundalini Yoga, which is part of this divine Yoga. Therefore, breath control is a key practice involved in Tibetan prayer.

ኣብ እዋን ናይቲ መደብ ካልኣይ ናይ ጸሎት መዝሙር መን ኣቕሪቡ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሳንጁ ሻርማ**.

The text states: ""ካብኡ ንድሓር፣ ላካሃ ሲንግ ንብሃጃንስ ብምድራፍ መሪሕነት ወሰደ।"" which translates to ""From him, Lakhha Singh took the leadership in organizing the prayers.""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: ጃይ ሻንካር ኮሆድሃሪ (Jay Shankar Chadhari)** was the host, not the one leading the prayers.
* **C: ሻሪም ሻያም (Shrim Shyam)** was the chief priest.
* **D: ሳንጁ ሻርማ (Sandhu Sharma)** was the chief priest who was sitting in front.

ኣብቲ መግለጺ ምርኩስ ብምግባር፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ሓቒ ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ነቲ ናይ መጀመርታ ሰብ ካብቲ መሳፈሪ ንምዉራድ እንተወሓድ 60 ደቓይቕ ወሲዱ (The first person took 60 minutes to get out of the sled from the rider)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""a single person takes an hour to get out of the sled.""
* **Option D incorrectly states:** ""60 minutes."" The passage specifically says *an hour*.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: ኣብ ሳንታ ክላራ ሓዊ ነበረ (There was wind in Santa Clara):** The passage mentions ""wind"" (""ናይ ሓዊ ሓለቓ ስኮት ካውንስ"").
* **B: ሰባት ኣብ ዝንከባለል ዕንክሊል ተታሒዞም ነበሩ (People were in a sled):** The passage explicitly says ""ንውሓት ግዘ ተኣጺኻ ምጽናሕ ምችው ኣይኾነን፤ ብንኡሱ ንምዝራብ፣ ሓደ ሰብ ንምውራድ እንተወሓደ ሓደ ስዓት ይወስድ"" (It wasn't possible to run for a while; furthermore, to get out, it takes an hour for one person to get out). This implies they were in a sled.
* **C: ገየሽቲ ማይ ተዋሂቦም (The water froze):** The passage states ""ገየሽቲ ማይ ተዋሂቦም"" which translates to ""frozen water froze"" meaning the water froze.

Therefore, only option D is factually incorrect based on the passage."

The text states that the passengers were ""surprised"" by the lack of snow. The quote from Scott Cash says it was a very warm day in Santa Clara, implying that snow was unexpected. Therefore, the passengers are the ones who would have been surprised by the absence of snow.
"
ብሰንኪ ናይ ሱናሚ ንጥፈታት ሕጽረት ናይ ኤሌትሪክ ኣበይ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ቶንጋ**.

The text states: ""ሓይሊ ንግዚኡ ጠፊኡ ነይሩ"" which translates to ""The power was cut off."" This refers to Tonga, as the text is discussing the impact of the tsunami *on* Tonga. While power outages might have affected other locations, the text specifically mentions the power being cut off in Tonga.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ብሰንኪ ሕጽረት ኤሌትሪክ ቶነጋ ብኸመይ ተጸልያ?,"The correct answer is **B: ሰብ-ስልጣናት ብዛዕባ ዝተላዕሉ መጠንቐቕታት ዜና ኣይበጽሖምን (Government didn't disseminate information about the tsunami alerts)**.

The text explicitly states that the Tongan people didn't hear the tsunami warning issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. This lack of information was a significant factor in the impact of the tsunami, even though the earthquake itself wasn't particularly strong.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ገለ ዕንወት ጸብጻብ ቐሪቡ ነይሩ (A nearby volcanic eruption occurred):** The text doesn't mention a volcanic eruption. The tsunami was caused by the earthquake.
* **C: ናይ ጽፍሒ ባሕሪ ንባባት ተጸልዮም (Seafloor fault ruptures occurred):** While the earthquake involved seafloor fault ruptures, the question is about *how Tonga was affected by a power outage*, and the text links the power outage to the lack of warning dissemination.
* **D: ሰብ-ስልጣናት ኣገደስቲ መጠንቐቕታት ክረኽቡ ኣይከኣሉን (Authorities couldn't find adequate alerts):** The text doesn't say authorities *couldn't* find alerts; it says they *didn't disseminate* the alerts effectively.

(New Zealand police stopped to check how much speed Mr. Ray was going while using their river speed measuring devices: the opportunity to find out how much speed Mr. Ray was going was when the speed was reduced to 160 km/h.)

Therefore, the police were able to issue a speeding ticket when he was driving at 160 km/h.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ፖላይስ ናይ ኒዉዝላንድ ፍጥነት ናይ ጆኒ ረድ ክልክዑ ኣጸጋሚ ዝኾነሉ ምኽንያት ስለምንታይ እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ታሕቲ 160ኪሜ ኣብ ሰዓት ይዝዉር ብምንባሩ (Driving below 160 km/h)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the New Zealand police used river gauges to measure how much the river was affected by Mr. Reid's driving. They were monitoring the river's speed, and it *decreased* to 160 km/h *while* Mr. Reid was driving at 160 km/h. This implies the police were concerned about the impact of his speed on the river, specifically because it was *below* his usual speed of 160 km/h.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: እታ መኪና ኣዝያ ታሕቲ ብምንባራ (The car was driving much below):** The text says he was driving *at* 160 km/h, not much below.
*   **C: ተደጋጋሚ ልዕሊ እቲ ቢንቶ ጥራይ እዩ ዘዊሩ (He only drove repeatedly over the bridge):** The text doesn't mention him driving only over the bridge.
*   **D: ቢንቶ ናይ ኣክላንድ ሃርቦር ኣዝዩ ኣረጊት እዩ (The Auckland Harbour bridge is very dangerous):** The text doesn't state the bridge is dangerous, only that the police were monitoring the river's reaction to his speed.

The passage states: ""እቲ ምንቅጥቃጥ መሬት ከባቢ 20km (15 miles) ሰሜን -ሰሜን ምብራቅ ዲልሎን ን ከባቢ 65 km (40 miles) ደቡብ ቡትቴን ይሽፍን"" which translates to ""The earthquake centered about 20km (15 miles) north-northeast of Dillon and about 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte.""

The text states that Abu Ghraib prison was a hub of prison abuses after the US forces took over, and that it was known for mistreating prisoners. Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the information given is prison abuses.
"
እቲ ናይ ዒራቕ ቤት-ማእሰርቲ ንምንታይ ተፈላጥነት ረኺቡ? ,"The correct answer is **D: ምርካብ ናይ መታእስርቲ ግፍዒ (Arbitrary prison brutality)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that after the US withdrawal, the prison became notorious for ""arbitrary brutality towards prisoners."" This directly aligns with option D.
* Options A, B, and C are not mentioned in the passage as reasons for the prison's notoriety. 

Therefore, the passage explicitly links the prison's reputation to arbitrary brutality."

The text also mentions that the company responsible for the band's management, HK Management Inc., hasn't disclosed the reason for the cancellation, but cited logistical reasons.  However, the *creation* of the visual spectacle is attributed to the band.
"

The text states that many veteran Bishkek residents accuse law enforcement officials of instigating the ""lawlessness"" situation. 

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **B: ወነንቲ ዱካን (Thugs/Criminals):** While the thugs are involved in looting, the text focuses on the accusation that law enforcement is behind the ""lawlessness.""
* **C: ተቓወምቲ (Protesters):** The text mentions Bishkek residents blaming law enforcement *for* provoking the protesters, not the other way around.
* **D: ኮተቴታት (Military):**  The text doesn't mention the military being implicated in this situation.
"

The text states: ""ብዙሕ ነባሮ ቢሽከክ ነቶም ካብ ደቡብ ዝመጽኡ ሰልፈኛታት ንሕጊ ኣልቦነት ተሓተትቲ ይገበሩዎ"" which translates to ""Many veteran Bishkek residents are accusing the protesters who came from the South of violating the law."" Therefore, the Bishkek opposition is accusing the protesters from the South of violating the law.

ሪንግ ልዑል መሸጣ መዓስ ኣጋጢሙ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ QVC ድሕሪ ምምጹኡ (After his appearance on QVC)**.

The text states: "" ኣብ 2017, ሲሚኖፍ ኣብ ናይ ዕድጊ ቴሌቭዥን ቻናል QVC ተራእዩ. ሪንግ ምስ እቲ መፎኻኽርቱ ዝኾነ, ኤዲቲ ኮርፖሬሽን, ዝነበሮ ክሲ ፈቲሑዎ እዩ."" which translates to ""In 2017, Siminoff appeared on the opportunity television channel QVC. Ring, with its partner ADT Corporation, closed a deal with him.""  This directly links the deal and likely the significant sales increase to his appearance on QVC.



While the other options have some connection, they aren't as direct or explicitly stated in the passage:

* **A: ድሕሪ ኣብ ሻርክ ታንክ ምምጹኡ (After his appearance on Shark Tank):** The text mentions Shark Tank but doesn't say sales exploded *immediately* after. It mentions he appeared *again* on QVC after.
* **B: ኣብ 2013 ገንዘብ ድሕሪ ምሓዙ (After securing funding in 2013):**  The text mentions securing funding in 2013, but doesn't connect it to a significant sales boom.
* **D: ምስ ADT ዝነበረ ሞጎተ ድሕሪ ምዝዛሙ (After the partnership with ADT was terminated):** The text mentions the partnership with ADT but not the termination.  Also, it connects it to a deal closing, not necessarily a sales boom.



"
ጄሚ ሰሚኒኦፍ ሪንግ ንኽጅምር መዓስ ወሲኑ?,"The correct answer is **B: ድሕሪ ምርኢት ናይ ሻርክ ታንክ ምዉዳቓ (After the Shark Tank appearance)**.

The text states: ""ሲሚኖፍ ኣብ 2013፣ ሻርክ ታንክ ኣብ ዝብል ክፍሊ ምስቐረበ እቲ መሸጣ ከምዝተማሓየሸ ገሊፁ."" (In 2013, he said he failed to sell his product when he appeared on Shark Tank.) and later ""... ኣብ ዳሕረዋይ 2017, ሲሚኖፍ ኣብ ናይ ዕድጊ ቴሌቭዥን ቻናል QVC ተራእዩ."" (...in late 2017, Seminoff appeared on the opportunity TV channel QVC.) and ""ሪንግ ምስ እቲ መፎኻኽርቱ ዝኾነ፣ ኤዲቲ ኮርፖሬሽን፣ ዝነበሮ ክሲ ፈቲሑዎ እዩ."" (Ring, with its partner, EDT Corporation, closed a deal.)

This implies that the Shark Tank appearance was a pivotal moment that led to further opportunities and ultimately, a deal. While the QVC appearance was also important, the Shark Tank experience is presented as the initial hurdle overcome to facilitate the deal with EDT Corporation.

This translates to ""In the television series, they also provide additional advice on books that children can borrow from the library."" The passage further emphasizes the importance of the TV series' role in fostering a love of reading and its significant impact on encouraging children to read.



While options B, C, and D are related to reading, the text *specifically* highlights the television series as a key element in the Rainbow's efforts to promote reading among children. The quote from John Grant directly praises the series' contribution to encouraging reading.
"

This translates to ""Thanks to Jon Grant's ideas, the funding was created and the philosophical educational television channel was established, and the series was created.""

While other factors contributed (like the Emmy awards and the show's popularity), the text directly attributes the series' creation to Jon Grant's ideas.

Here's why:

The text states that the overgrown land was reported as a potential threat to public health and that the Amsterdam city authorities and the Anne Frank House described it as such.  Option D directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ምፍራሱ ዘይተርፍ እዩ** (It is not worth mentioning): The text explicitly *does* mention it, indicating it's important.
* **B: ክዕቐቡ ኣለዎም** (They should proceed): This doesn't relate to the reason for the concern about the overgrown land.
* **C: ብፋንጋሳት ዝተበከለ እዩ** (It was overgrown with weeds): While true, it's a description of the state of the land, not the *reason* for the authorities' concern.  The concern is the *danger* posed by the overgrowth.

The text states that the Royal Society is again proposing to have CCTV cameras installed on all Australian farms to protect animal welfare and deter livestock theft.  David O'Shaughnessy, RSPCA New South Wales chief inspector, says this CCTV would ""clearly send a strong message to people who work with animals about the high priority they place on their welfare.""

The passage states: ""ናይ እቲ ወቕቲ ሴናተር ከምኡውን ናይ አርጀንቲና ቀዳማይ ወይዘሮ ክሪስቲና ፈርናንዴዝ ዲ ኪርችነር ትማሊ ምሸት ካብ ቦነስ አይረስ 50 ኪሎ ሜትሮ ሪሕቃ ትርከብ ኣብ ላ ፕላታ ከተማ ንፕሬዝዳንትነት ከም እትወዳደር ኣፍሊጣ።"" This translates to: ""At the time, Senator and former Argentine First Lady Cristina Fernández de Kirchner fled 50 kilometers from Buenos Aires, in La Plata city, to compete for the presidency.""

The question asks where she was aiming her support. The passage clarifies she was at a theater 31 miles from La Plata.

ብዛዕባ ቢግ ብራዘር ዝምልከት ርኽበታት ናይ ACMA እንታይ ነይሮም?,"The correct answer is **C: ሕግታት ናይ ምምያ ተጣሒሶም እዮም (The regulations were not violated)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that because Big Brother's online platform did not have the content pre-approved by ACMA, it did not violate the law. The key point is that the law applies when content is *uploaded to a server*. Since the video wasn't uploaded *to* Big Brother's website (and therefore, wasn't publicly accessible there), the regulations weren't broken.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሕግታት ናይ ምምያ ኣይተጣሕሱን (The regulations were not violated):** This is a true statement, but it's not the *most* accurate answer as it doesn't explain *why* the regulations weren't violated.
*   **B: መርበብ ኣብ ዌብሳይት ናይ ቢግ ብራዘር ተዓቒቦም ተረኽቦ (The content was found on Big Brother's website):** The passage states that the content *wasn't* on Big Brother's website, making this option incorrect.
*   **D: ትሕዝቶ ኣብ ሰርቨር ብኣካል ተቐሚጡ ተረኽበ (The content was physically uploaded to a server):** The passage clarifies that the content wasn't physically uploaded to Big Brother's server.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate and complete answer because it directly addresses the core reason why ACMA's regulations weren't violated in this scenario."

Here's why:

The passage states that while the ACMA (a regulatory body) might have concerns about a video being on Big Brother's website, it's not a violation of online content laws *if* the video is physically stored on a server.  The key point is that to be considered ""online content,"" it must reside on a server.  The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **A: ኣብ ኢንተርነት ክወጽእ ኣለዎ (It must be accessible on the internet):** Accessibility isn't enough; it needs to be *stored* on a server.
*   **C: ኣብ ዌብሳይት ክጽዓን የብሉን (It can't be on a website):** The passage *does* mention Big Brother's website, implying it *can* be on a website, but it needs to be on a server to be considered online content.
*   **D: በቲ ACMA ተቓባልነት ክረክብ ኣለዎ (It must comply with ACMA regulations):** Compliance is important, but the passage focuses on the physical storage on a server as a core requirement for online content.

The provided text doesn't explicitly state *why* Australia doesn't have nuclear power. However, Peter Costello's argument *against* opposing nuclear power implies that a lack of support is a key factor he's addressing. The context suggests that the lack of public support is a barrier to exploring nuclear power as an energy source. The text doesn't offer information supporting the other options (very complex, very dangerous, very beneficial).

* Mexico's Arril Velasquez finished 15th (men's event).

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ብዛዕባ ብሌክ ቕኑዕ ዘይኮነ መግለጺ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ነቲ መጥቓዕቲ ኣመነሉ (Believed the assault)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Black ""denied committing the assault"" and used the weapon to defend himself from a thrown object. The judge found Black's testimony ""unbelievable"" (ዘይተርፍ), implying the judge didn't believe Black's account of events and therefore didn't believe the assault occurred as Black described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብቲ ፍጻሜ ተኣሰረ (Entrusted in the end):** The judge *didn't* entrust in Black; he found his testimony unbelievable.
*   **C: ኣብቲ ናይ መጥቓዕቲ ግዜ ፓሎ ተጠቐመ (Palo was used during the assault):** The passage states Black used the weapon to *defend himself* *from* an object thrown at him. It doesn't imply the object *was* the assault.
*   **D: ጠራሙዝ ናብኡ ከም ዝተሰንደወ ከሰሰ (The object was thrown at him):** The passage states a ""thrown object"" was involved, and Black used the weapon to defend himself *from it*. This is true according to the text.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Blake *didn't* commit any violent attack at the Crown Court. It specifically mentions he was arrested *after* he threw a pot at someone and used that as a reason to plead guilty.
* The passage explicitly says he pleaded guilty to throwing a pot.
* The passage mentions he was sentenced to prison and that the judge considered it a ""disgraceful"" outcome. It also says he was arrested after throwing a pot.

Therefore, option C, ""By a patio attack,"" is something that *didn't* happen to Blake according to the text. The text describes him throwing a pot, not a patio attack.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ከም ተወሳኺ ሕብረት ሃገራት ብዓለማዊ ምውዓይ ዝተጸልዉ ሃገራት ነቲ ጽልዋ ንምብዳህ ዝሕግዝ ምወላ ንምስላጥ ትስፉው እዩ"" which translates to ""Furthermore, the Union of countries with a global vision is striving to facilitate the transfer of technology to developing countries to mitigate climate change.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምብዛሕ ዝራእቲ (Very common):** While technology transfer is *being* facilitated, the passage doesn't say it's ""very common"" or widespread yet.
*   **C: ካብ ማይ ምዕልቕላቕላቕ ዝከላኸሉ ኣባይቲ (Water-saving appliances):**  Water-saving appliances are *an example* of technology, but the passage is referring to a broader range of technologies.
*   **D: ጽልዋታት ናይ ዓለማዊ ሙቖት ምጉዳል (Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions):** Reducing emissions is the *goal* of the technology transfer, not the act of transfer itself.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...United Nations member states are striving to facilitate the transfer of technology that promotes climate change mitigation and adaptation to developing countries."" It also mentions that ""This money can go to countries with limited resources, which have abundant water and medical supplies."" 

Therefore, the passage indicates that developed countries are aiming to help developing countries by providing **money** to facilitate the transfer of **technology** for climate change solutions.

    * **C: መሰረታዉያን ሕግታት (The foundational laws)** - He stated they hadn't yet been received but were the ""key foundation.""

* **D: ፍቓድ ግብሪ (Freedom of movement)** is *not* mentioned in the passage as something Albert Muchanga commented on. Therefore, it's the correct answer.

The passage states that while the Atlanta Journal reported on discrepancies in test scores, they **didn't address the internal problems** within the school system that the investigation revealed.  The passage specifically says the newspaper article ""didn't address the issues found within.""



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብቲ ጸብጻብ ናይ ጋዜጣ-ቕዋም ምትንኻፋት ከም ዝነበረ (The newspaper article was a breakdown):** While the article reported on problems, it didn't necessarily *break down* in a way that was unhelpful. It more accurately *didn't address* the core internal issues.
*   **B: ናይ ከበሳ ትምህርቲ ዘይምምሕያሾም (Didn't investigate the teachers):** The article *did* investigate the teachers, leading to the termination of over 34. However, the passage emphasizes that they *didn't address the internal problems* revealed by the investigation more broadly.
*   **D: ትሑት ናይ ምርመራ ነጥብታት ጸብጻብ ምሃቦም (Giving a low investigative point):** The article *did* present investigative points, but the crucial point is that they didn't *address* the internal problems found through that investigation.

Here's why:

The text focuses on the cheating scandal and the subsequent investigation by the Atlanta Journal. It mentions the initial praise for Atlanta schools, the cheating allegations, the investigation by the newspaper, the discovery of falsified test papers, and the firing of teachers. 

Option D, ""Insights into teaching excellence,"" is something that *wasn't* covered in the article. The article is about a scandal and the problems that arose, not about highlighting successes or excellence in teaching. The other options *were* discussed in the text:

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺ ብዛዕባ ዕዱማት ናይ መዕረፊ ኣጋይሽ ሓቒ ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The incorrect statement is **A: እቶም ኣጋይሽ ኣብ ሜካ ንንግት መጽዮም ነበሩ (They were in Mecca for a pilgrimage to the tomb of Adam)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the pilgrims were in Mecca for Hajj, a pilgrimage to the Kaaba, not to the tomb of Adam.** The Hajj is a significant religious duty for Muslims, and its focus is on the Kaaba and performing specific rituals. The tomb of Adam is a separate, though revered, site.

Let's look at why the other options are likely true based on the information provided:

* **B: ገለ ካብቶም ኣጋይሽ ናይቲ ሃገር ዜጋታት ኣይነበሩን (Some of the pilgrims were not citizens of that country).** The passage mentions that many pilgrims were from the UAE, but doesn't say *all* were. It's highly probable that pilgrims came from various countries.
* **C: እቶም ኣጋይሽ ንድሮ ናይ ሃጅ እዮም መጽዮም (They were in Mecca for Hajj).**  The passage explicitly states that the pilgrims were Hajj pilgrims.
* **D: መብዝሓትኦም ካብቶም ኣጋይሽ ካብቲ ቕዱስ ከተማ ነበሩ (The majority of the pilgrims were from the holy city).** This statement is a bit ambiguous, but the passage implies that the majority were pilgrims *to* Mecca, the holy city.  It's possible the statement means they were from other holy cities/regions, which isn't necessarily false.

Therefore, option A is the statement that directly contradicts the information in the passage.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ኣየናይ እዩ ቕኑዕ?,"The correct answer is **D: መብዝሓትኦም ካብቶም ኣጋይሽ ናይ ሜካ ነበርቲ ነበሩ (The majority of them were pilgrims from Mecca).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""እቲ ክውስኽ ትጽቢት ዝግበረሉ ዘሎ ብዝሒ ናይ ዝሞቱ ሰባት ብውሑዱ 15 እዩ"" (The number of those who died was only 15).  This directly contradicts option A (""ዝሞቱ ኣይነበሩን"" - None died).
* **The passage states:** ""እቲ ህንጻ ድሮ ጉዕዞ ሃጅ ናብታ ቕድስቲ ኸተማ ንምጉብናይ ዝመጹ ብዙሓት ሓጅታት ተቐሚጠም"" (The building was immediately occupied by many pilgrims who had traveled for the Hajj pilgrimage to the holy city). This implies they were pilgrims *to* Mecca.
* **The passage states:** ""אጋይሽ እቲ ሆቴል መብዛሕትኦም ዜጋታት ዩናይትድ ዓረብ ኢሚሬትስ እዮም ኔሮም።"" (The majority of the hotel's residents were citizens of the United Arab Emirates.).  This means the *majority* were from the UAE, not that they were *pilgrims from* the UAE.
* **The passage states:** ""እቶም ኣጋይሽ ንድሮ ናይ ሃጅ ንግደት እዮም መጽዮም"" (The pilgrims were from the day of Hajj). This doesn't make sense and isn't a logical statement.



Therefore, option D is the only one that accurately reflects information present in the text.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the collision caused an ""enormous explosion"" and that researchers are still working to understand its impact on Earth.
* Option C directly addresses this consequence of the collision, which is a major focus of the news report.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ዓቐን ናይቲ ግጭት (The cause of the collision):** The text doesn't specify *why* the satellites collided, only that they did.
* **B: ቦታ ናይቲ ግጭት (The location of the collision):** The text says the collision happened 491 miles above Earth. While this is mentioned, the *location* isn't the primary focus of the report.
* **D: ቦታ ናይ ዝተሰባበረ (The location of the debris):** While debris is mentioned, the report's focus is on the impact on Earth and the broader implications.

Therefore, the impact of the collision on Earth is the most central and discussed aspect of the news report.
"

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""As a result of the collision, a large explosion occurred."" and ""Because the collision was so severe, it is still being monitored to ensure it does not impact the Earth."" This highlights the concern about the debris field.
* The other options are not the primary focus of the text. While the speed (B) and the analysis of the collision (C) are mentioned, the main concern raised is the spread and potential impact of the debris (A).
* Option D, ""ልክዕ ዓቐን ናይቲ ግጭት (the magnitude of the collision)"", is related but not the *specific* extent of what's being monitored.



Therefore, option A best reflects the central point of the passage regarding the collision."

Therefore, the answer must refer to the list of American donors. The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: እቲ ዩኒቨርስቲ ናይ ቨርጂንያ (University of Virginia):** While he graduated from there, the question is about *who* he gave to, not where he received his education.

*   **D: ኮሌጃት ኣብ ቕብኣን ሳይንስን ዝተዋፈራ (Colleges focused on art and science):** While he graduated from the art and science college, the question is about *who* he donated to.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ሚለር ንርኢቶ ክሕተት እንከሎ """"ማይክ ኣብቲ እዋን ምስማዕ መጋባኣያ ብዙሕ እዩ ለፍሊፉ፤ እንዳተዳለውኩኩ ስለዝነበረ ብሓቂ እንታይ ይብል ከምዝነበረ ኣይሰማዕኽዎን"""" በለ፡፡"" This translates to: ""Miller said, 'Mike, at that time my ears were filled with a lot of noise; because of my situation, I really didn't hear what he was saying.'""

This clearly indicates that Miller was in a situation where he *couldn't* hear properly due to external distractions (""a lot of noise"") and his own circumstances (""because of my situation"").  Therefore, he wasn't in a position to speak or be heard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብቲ ጉባኤ ዱቫል ኣብ ልዕሊ ሚለር ጦብላሕታ ገበረ (Duval attacked Miller at the meeting):** The text doesn't mention any attack by Duval.
*   **C: እቶም ንዱቫል ክልተ ደቑ ኣብቲ ጉባኤ ብዙሕ ይዛረቡ ነበሩ (Duval's two supporters talked a lot at the meeting):** The text focuses on Miller's inability to hear and doesn't provide details about Duval's supporters.
*   **D: ንታሪኽ ናይ ዱቫል ጽቡቕ ኣቓልቦ ሂቡ ነበረ (Good praise was given to Duval's story):**  The text is about Miller's experience and doesn't discuss praise for Duval's story.

Here's why:

The text states that the Prime Minister is ""seeking to summon a national party committee to vote on the 'clean air' bill"" and that this is being done ""as a means to prepare for the upcoming federal election."" This indicates that the government is using the bill and the election as a way to demonstrate its power and achievements.  It's a tactic employed by the ruling government.

The other options are too specific:

* **B: ሓደ ፕራይም ሚኒስተር (One Prime Minister):** While the Prime Minister is initiating the process, it's not *just* the Prime Minister. It's the power of the government *led by* the Prime Minister.
* **C: ናይ NDP ሓላፊ (Leader of the NDP):** The NDP leader is involved in the discussions, but the initiative and the political strategy are coming from the ruling government.
* **D: ሓደ ፌደራል MP (One Federal MP):**  A single Federal MP wouldn't be responsible for a nationwide strategy for an election.

This translates to: ""The researchers isolated crystals formed by mixing melamine and oxalic acid in blood. The concentration of these crystals is comparable to that found in the blood of poisoned domestic animals by comparing it with infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

Therefore, they used FTIR to analyze the **concentration of crystals in the blood of domestic animals** to see if their created crystals were similar to those found in poisoned animals.

The other options are incorrect because:

The text explicitly states: ""ካብቲ ግዜ እቲ ኣትሒዙ ቁጠባዊ ዓቕሚ ቻይና ብ90 ዕጽፊ ዓብዩ ኣሎ (Since then, China's economic capacity has increased by 90 times).""

Option D directly contradicts the information provided in the text, which clearly states that China *has* surpassed Germany in car manufacturing.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: ምምሕያሻት ድሕሪ ምግባሮም ናይ ቻይና ቑጠባ ኣዝዩ ዓበየ (Their reforms have made China's economy very powerful):** The text explicitly states that China's economic capacity has increased dramatically (by 90 times).

While the text also mentions overall economic growth and surpassing Germany, the most direct answer to whether China's GDP *could* surpass the US is within the next two decades (15 years). Option B, "" ኣብ ዉሽጢ ክልተ ዓሰርተ ዓመታት (Within the next two decades)"", is the closest and most reasonable interpretation of the information given.

The text states: ""መጀመሪያ ኣርሲሕኻ ዳሓር ምፅራግ ልምዲ ንከወግዳ"" which translates to ""First, take responsibility for your own development, and then you can help other countries with development."" This directly relates to the idea of taking responsibility for one's own development and fulfilling the duties that come with it, implying a certain level of responsibility and obligation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ናይ ቑጠባ ዉጺኢት ከተኩራ (To interfere with economic results):** Hu explicitly states that he didn't explain the economic gains from China's model.  He is *not* advocating interference with economic results.
* **C: ካብ ህሉዉ ሓላፍነታተን ንልዕሊ ክኸዳ (To surpass the privileges of others):** While Hu criticizes others for seeking privileges, he isn't saying they should *surpass* them. He's saying they shouldn't seek them in the first place.
* **D: ሕሉፍ ኣካይዳ ናይ ብከላ ከወግዳ (Ancient idea of protecting the country):** The text doesn't link Hu's statement to ancient ideas of protecting the country. His focus is on development and responsibility.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ሁ ኣብ ምምዕባል ንዝርከባ ሃገራት “መጀመሪያ ኣርሲሕኻ ዳሓር ምፅራግ ልምዲ ንከወግዳ” የበረታተዐን፡፡"" This translates to ""Hu, in addressing developing countries, said 'First develop your economy, then you can focus on environmental protection.'"" This directly relates to climate change advice for developing nations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መሰረት ነቶም ቐይድታት (Based on the challenges):** While the context mentions challenges, the core of Hu's statement isn't about the challenges themselves.
*   **C: ናይ ካርቦን ምዝርጋሕ ክቓረጸሉ ዝትስፈዎ ዕለት (The date they intended to continue reducing carbon):** The passage mentions reducing carbon emissions in the past, but doesn't specify a future date.
*   **D: ስእሊ ንምቑራጽ ዝርጋሐ ካርቦን (Carbon that reduced the image):**  This doesn't align with the content about economic development and environmental protection.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate description of what Hu addressed in the passage."

The passage states that the artist, inspired by his love of plants, brought a story of St. Sean to the French opera, and as a result, actors would appear on stage with cannabis, and even theatergoers were encouraged to smoke. Therefore, the audience was encouraged to consume cannabis during the performances.
"
ኣብ ግዜ ኦፕራ ዝበዝሐ ሽጋራ ዘትከኸ መን ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **A: እቲ ኣርቲስት (The artist)**.

The text states that the artist, in his life in Japan, cultivated a love for cannabis and that as a result, the actors on stage would appear with it, and even the theatergoers were encouraged to smoke. Therefore, the artist is the one who brought the issue of cannabis to the opera.

The text states that the spacewalk was known as ""ምንቅስቃስ ጠፈር"" which translates to ""Extravehicular Activity"" or ""Spacewalk"" in English. Option C, ""ንጥፈት ኤክስትራቪሂኩላር,"" is the direct translation of this term.
"
ሎዮኖቭ ነየናይ ክፋል ተልእኾ ናይ ሶቬት መሪሕዎ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኮስሞናት ቑ. 11 (Cosmonaut #11)**.

The text explicitly states that ""ሌኖቭ ከምኡ ድማ “ኮስሞናት ቁ 11” ብምባል ዝፍለጥ ናይ ሶቭየት ሕብረት ናይ ፈለማ ጉጅለ ስነ ህዋ ኣባል ነይሩ"" which translates to ""Leonov was also known as 'Cosmonaut #11', a member of the Soviet research group in space.""  The rest of the paragraph describes his significance *as* Cosmonaut #11 and his achievement of the first spacewalk.

Options B (Apollo-Soyuz) and D (EVA) are related to space exploration but not the specific role Leonov is described as having in the text. Option A (the first spacewalk) is a result of his role as Cosmonaut #11, not the role itself.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""ድሕሪ እቲ ሓደጋ ምግጣሙ፣ ጊብሰን ናብ ሕክምና ተወስደ ግን ኣብ ሓጺር ግዘ ሞተ።"" (After the accident, Gibsen was taken to the hospital but died within a short time.) This confirms one person died.
* The text also states: ""እቲ ወዲ 64 ዓመት ኣውቲስታ ናይ'ታ ጽዕነት መኪና በቲ ሓደጋ ኣይተጎድኣን።"" (The 64-year-old autistic man in the car was not injured in the accident.) This indicates at least one person was *not* injured.
* While other people were present at the scene, the text doesn't specify their condition, only that they were shaken and scared.

Therefore, one person died, and one person was not injured.

Here's why:

The passage states that the program was designed to observe the collision between the Milky Way and the Sagittarius Galaxy, which involves a powerful gravitational force.  The researchers hypothesized that a dark matter halo around the Sagittarius Galaxy played a crucial role in this collision. The passage specifically mentions that the dense dark matter in the galaxy created a powerful gravitational pull.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ረጉላር ማተር (Regular matter):** While regular matter is part of galaxies, the focus of the program was on *dark* matter's role in the collision.
* **B: ናይ ማዕበል ሓይልታት (Nebular forces):**  The passage refers to gravitational forces, not nebular forces.
* **C: ደቐቕቲ ጥረታት (Dust lanes):** Dust lanes are visible components within galaxies, but the core hypothesis related to the *halo* of dark matter.

Here's why:

The text states that the program was designed to observe the *Sagittarius Galaxy*. It also draws a parallel between the Milky Way's gravitational pull on Sagittarius and the Moon's gravitational pull on Earth. Therefore, researchers were studying both the **Sagittarius Galaxy** *and* the **Milky Way**.

Here's why:

* The passage focuses on the delay in the recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina. It mentions the ""Bush's New Orleans Contract"" being delayed and the ongoing struggle for rebuilding. 
* The passage highlights that the people of Washington were disappointed with the slow progress. 
* Option B directly addresses this central theme of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ናይ ረዲኤት ወጻኢታት (Relief aid for overseas countries):** The passage is specifically about New Orleans, not overseas countries.
* **C: ናይ ዳግመ ህንጸት ኮንትራት ዝወሃብ ዘሎ መን’ዩ (Who is giving the reconstruction contract):** While the contract is mentioned, the core issue isn't *who* is giving it, but the *delay* in the overall process.
* **D: ወጻኢታት ናይ ዳግመ ህንጸት (Overseas reconstruction):** Similar to A, the passage is focused on domestic reconstruction in New Orleans.

The subsequent recovery efforts and rebuilding efforts were a point of contention (""ናይ ነጻነት ወቐሳ ዳግም ናይ ዝህነጹ ውዕላት ንነበርቲ ዋሺንግቶን ኣብ ምሃብ ዝጠመተ እዩ""). This implies the financial community was heavily involved in the economic repercussions and recovery process following Hurricane Katrina, leading to the mentioned agreement.

While the rebuilding efforts impacted Washington, the initial fiscal response and agreement were driven by the financial community. The other options aren't directly supported by the text.

The text states that the Starship was observed flying across the sky heading towards areas in Northern California, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah. Therefore, people in Northern California were among the first to see the lights from the Starship.

The text explicitly states that the spacecraft travels from San Francisco to Los Angeles in just one minute at a speed of 12.8 km/h (8 mph). This is highlighted as a new speed record for spacecraft. The other options are not directly mentioned or supported by the text."
ዶክተር ባላሱብራማኒያን ንሳሮጃ ባላሱብራማኒያን ብኸምይ ይዛመዳ?,"The correct answer is **B: ጓሉ (Son)**.

The text states that Dr. Malar Balasubramaniyan's 53-year-old brother, Sarojja Balasubramanian, was found with gunshot wounds. Therefore, Dr. Balasubramaniyan is Sarojja Balasubramanian's son."

ብኢበይ እንታይ ተረኺቡ?,"The correct answer is **C: ስካይፕ (Skype)**.

The passage states that eBay is hoping to diversify its revenue streams by expanding its presence in markets like China, Western Europe, and Brazil, leveraging its partnerships with companies like Skype."

Here's why:

The passage states that eBay is hoping to diversify its revenue streams by expanding into markets like China, Western Europe, and Brazil. The ultimate goal of these expansions is to increase the company's profitability for its shareholders.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣታዊኡ ከወሃህድ (To continue its current operations):** While likely a part of the strategy, the passage emphasizes *diversification*, not just continuation.
* **B: ናብ ሓደስቲ ግዝኣታት ከስፋሕፍሕ (To expand into new industries):** The passage mentions expanding into *markets*, not necessarily new industries.
* **C: ስሙ ክብ ከብል (To increase its reputation):** While a positive outcome, the primary driver of the expansion is financial - increasing profitability for shareholders.

The investigators tried to understand the situation, but the prisoners' accounts were not clear.""

Since the investigators were trying to understand the situation and the prisoners' accounts were unclear, the remaining prisoners who were not involved in the initial fire are described as **witnesses** to the event.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ጉጅለ መጥፋእቲ ሓዊ (Wind Killers):** The text refers to a ""ሓዊ ምክልኻል"" (Wind security/control force) that eventually extinguished the fire. They are not described as ""Wind Killers"" in this text.
*   **C: ሓለቃ ፖላይስ (Police Chief):** While the police were involved in arresting the prisoners later, the text doesn't mention the Police Chief specifically.
*   **D: ሰራሕተኛታት ሆስፒታል (Hospital Staff):** The text mentions hospitals in the context of arrests and later, but hospital staff are not directly mentioned as being present or involved with the remaining prisoners after the fire.

The passage states: "" ኣብ መንጎ ሰዓታት 10፡00-11፡00 ድ.ቀ. MDT፣ ሓዊ ባርዕ በቶም እሱራት ኣብ'ቲ ሜዳ ተወሊዑ"" which translates to ""Between the hours of 10:00-11:00 AM, a strong wind blew the debris onto the field.""  This directly indicates that the wind was the force that scattered the debris.

The other options are not mentioned as factors in the passage:

* **A: ዕዉት ምዉዕዓል (Earthquake):** There's no mention of an earthquake.
* **B: መንብዒ ጋዝ (Gas explosion):** There's no mention of a gas explosion.
* **C: ዝተጎዱኡ ማተሳስርቶም (Damaged structures):** While damaged structures might contribute to debris, the passage specifically attributes the scattering to the wind.

Here's why:

The passage states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the economic sanctions imposed by the European Union (due to Iran's oil exports) as a ""game."" He then asserted that Iran would achieve independence by breaking free from **foreign powers**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ገንዘባዊ ቐይድታት (Financial constraints):** While financial constraints are a consequence of the sanctions, Khamenei's statement goes beyond just the financial difficulties. He frames it as a struggle against external forces.
*   **B: እቲ ናይ እምነት ምስልምና ሰዉራ (The Islamic faith and ideology):** While the Islamic faith is central to Iran's identity, Khamenei's statement specifically targets *external* interference, not the internal faith itself.
*   **D: ኣብ ዘይቲ ዘለዋ ተሞርኳስነት (Oil dependency):** Khamenei views the sanctions related to oil as a ""game,"" but his ultimate goal is to overcome external influence, not just break oil dependency.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting Khamenei's vision is that Iran will achieve independence by overcoming **foreign powers**."

This translates to: ""The supreme leader of the country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, described the oil production as a 'game', and said that the country would achieve independence.""



Therefore, according to the text, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei believes the past sanctions are a game and that Iran will achieve independence.

Here's why:

The text explicitly details the procedures for ensuring the integrity of the ballot box process in France, including the use of weighted envelopes and the wind dispersal of ballot papers. While auditors might *observe* the process, they are not a core *part of the election system's design* as described in the text.

The other options are directly related to the French election system:

*   **B: ብሕጹያት ዝተሰዱ ወኪላት (Witnesses who seal ballot boxes):**  The text mentions the sealing of ballot boxes and the role of witnesses.
*   **C: ምፍራም ተራ ናይ ድምጺ ምርጫ (Random selection of ballot papers):** The text describes the random dispersal of ballot papers using wind.
*   **D: ድምጺ ምርጫ ብወኪላት ሕጹያት ይፍቐዱ (Ballot boxes are sealed by witnesses):** The text mentions the role of witnesses in sealing ballot boxes.

ኣለን ናይ ሸሞንተ-ዓመት ድልያ ነቲ ሙሻሺ ዘኸተሎ እንታይ ነበረ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሃብቱ (His passion)**.

The text states: ""እዚ ርክብ እዚ እንተተረጋጊጹ ነቲ ኣለን ንሙሳሺ ንሸሞንተ ዓመት ዝገበሮ ኣለሻ ዛዘሞ።"" which translates to ""To fix this vessel, Allen had been dedicated to Musashi for eight years.""  ""ዝገበሮ"" (zgebero) means dedicated or passionate.

The text states that Alan, a renowned figure, started to search for Musashi (the shipwreck) because of his love for the ship and his experience in combat. The sentence ""ንሙሳሺ ንምርካብ ዝጽዕር ከም ዝጀመረን እዩ ዝዝረብ"" translates to ""He started to search for Musashi.""  The text implies he used his wealth to fund this exploration. The other options are not directly supported by the text.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the television report indicated a leakage of **radioactive cesium and iodine** from the factory.  It then goes on to say that this event is being feared because it could **affect the health of workers and cause damage to the surrounding area due to uranium contamination.** While cesium and iodine are harmful, the primary concern highlighted as a wider danger is the potential uranium contamination.

Therefore, uranium is the best answer as the one that represents the broader, more concerning threat mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states that people inside the factory were worried about:

*   **Radioactive dust entering the factory:** This is the main concern, as mentioned in the first sentence.
*   **Spilling radioactive material:** They were careful not to spill radioactive material.
*   **The potential for uranium contamination:** The report warned about the potential for uranium to contaminate the environment.

Option C directly reflects the worry expressed in the passage about radioactive dust being inhaled. The other options are either actions they took to prevent contamination (B, D) or a general aspect of the situation (A).

The passage explicitly states: ""ብጣዕሚ ልዑል ናይ ሞት መጠን ስለዘለዎ፣ ብጣዕሚ ዘጨንቕን ዘፍርሕን እዩ"" which translates to ""Because it has a very high mortality rate, it is extremely dangerous.""

The text states: ""ዶክተር ሞል ብውሕዱ እቶም ክልተ፣ ሰራሕተኛታት እቲ ሆስፒታል ከምዝነበሩ ይሓስብ。"" which translates to ""Dr. Mole suspects that only the two hospital staff members were involved."" This implies that only one staff member was infected with the new strain.

Here's why:

* The passage states that NextGen uses satellite technology to provide air traffic controllers with ""more precise guidance and more accurate messaging to pilots."" This directly relates to increased precision navigation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሓጸርቲ መብረሪ መንገድታት (Improved runway routes):** While NextGen might indirectly influence runway routes, the primary function described is precise *navigation*.
* **C: ናይ ካርቦን ምዉጻእ የጉድል (Carbon reduction benefits):** Carbon reduction is a consequence of some of NextGen's improvements, but not the direct way it interacts with air traffic controllers.
* **D: ዝወሓደ ነዳዲ (Increased fuel):** NextGen aims to *reduce* fuel consumption, not increase it.

The text explicitly states that the historians focused on the FBI's success in solving cases involving stolen machinery. The passage mentions ""ብፍላይ ድማ ኣብ ዝተሰርቃ መካይን ብምትኳሮም ነቒፎሞ"" which translates to ""especially in resolving cases of stolen machinery through investigations.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ዓወት ደረጃኦም ምልዓል (The extent of their success):** While the text discusses success, it's not the primary focus. The focus is on *what kind* of cases they solved.
*   **B: ናብ ብቐሊል ክፍቱሑ ዝኽእሉ ገበናት ንዋት ምምዳብ (Developing easily exploitable markets):** This is not mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states the FBI's mission is to assess the scale of cybercrime and address it.  The Congress provided funding to the FBI for this purpose. The options directly relate to how the FBI should utilize this funding.  

* **A** is the most logical response because increasing funding is a direct way to tackle cybercrime.
* **B** is a consequence of successful crime fighting, not the primary action to take *with* the funding.
* **C** is too narrow. While targeting key areas is important, the overall goal is broader than just specific areas.
* **D** is not directly related to the core mission of fighting cybercrime.

The text states that the JAS 39C Gripen collided with a ""መልዓሊ ነፋሪት"" (Mel'ali Nefarit), and the question asks what kind of aircraft it was. The text explicitly says it was the ""ተጋጭያ"" (opponent) fighter jet.
"

Therefore, until 1977, Brzezinski held the position of National Security Advisor."

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""ምስ ጋንትኡ ኣብ ዝነበረሉ ግዜ ኣብ 468 ጸወታታት 403 ሽቶ ኣቑጺሩ"" (With his club during that time, he played in 468 matches and scored 403 goals). This is a specific and quantifiable detail about his work with Partizan Belgrade.

Let's look at why the other options are less precise:

* **B: ካብ ዝኾነ ካልእ ተጻዋታይ ዝበዝሐ ጎላት ኣመዝጊቡ (He scored more goals than any other player).** While he scored a lot of goals, the text doesn't say he scored *more* than any other player. It just mentions the total number of goals he scored.
* **C: ኣብታ ናይታ ጋንታ ታሪኽ ዝበለጸ ተጻዋታይ ተባሂሉ ሓንሳብ ተሸይሙ ነይሩ (He was hailed as the most distinguished player in the history of that club).** This is a conclusion drawn from his career, but the text doesn't detail *how* he was hailed.
* **D: ካብ ካልእ ተጻዋታይ ንላዕሊ ኣብ ዝበዝሑ ጸወታታት ተራእዩ (He experienced more matches than any other player).** The text doesn't specifically state he experienced *more* matches than other players, just that he played in a large number of matches.

The text states: "" ኣብ 1945 ተጸንቢርዎም"" which translates to ""He started playing in 1945"".  The other options are incorrect:

* **B: ቅድሚ ፓርቲዝያን በልግሬድ ንዛግረብ ተጻዊቱ (Played for Zagreb before Partizan in Belgrade)** - The text doesn't mention playing for Zagreb before Partizan.
* **C: ክሳብ 1995 ንፓርቲዝያን ተጻዊቱ (Played for Partizan until 1995)** - While he played until 1995, the question asks about his *initial* involvement.
* **D: ድሕሪ ናይ ፓርቲዝያን ዝበለጸ ተጻዋታይ ተባሂሉ ምስማዩ ተፈላጥነት ረኸበ (Was recognized as a distinguished Partizan player after)** - This describes his recognition, not the start of his career with the club.

*   **C: ምሉእ ክንቲት ዘለዎ ሰዉነት ኣለዎ (Has a full body like a human)** - The text describes it as a dinosaur.

The passage states that ""Hesperonychus"" is named for its second longest claw, and the name means ""western claw"" (from ""hesperon"" meaning ""western"" and ""onychus"" meaning ""claw""). Therefore, the physical description related to the name is its **tail (ጽፍሪ)**.

* **A: እቲ በዓል-ቤትን እታ በዓልቲ-ቤትን ክልቲኦም ካብ ቴክሳስ እዮም (Both the man and woman are from Texas):** The passage only says they were found in Texas, not that they are originally from there.
* **B: ሓሙሽተ ግዳያት ነበሩ (There were five shootings):** The passage states four people were shot, and the man survived. This option incorrectly says there were five shootings.
* **D: እቲ ተኹሲ ኣብ ባፎ ኣጋጢሙ (The killer was found in Buffalo):** The passage states the *relatives* were found in Buffalo, not the killer.

Therefore, option C is the only statement directly and accurately supported by the provided text."

Here's why:

* The passage states the incident occurred ""ኣብ ድሕር ዝበለ ዕለት ከምዝተመደ ሓለፍታት ሓቢሮ"" which translates to ""in the aftermath of the traditional funeral rites."" This strongly suggests it happened at a memorial or remembrance ceremony.
* While the incident happened in Texas, the passage emphasizes his move to Buffalo and his family ties there.  The location of the memorial service is more relevant to the *final outcome* of the event.
* Options A, C, and D are less specific and don't align with the detail about traditional funeral rites mentioned in the passage.  

Therefore, **B** is the most fitting description of where the final outcome (the memorial) occurred.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ኣብ መንጎ እቶም ሰበ-ስልጣናት ብዛዕባ እቲ ሉኖ እቲ ናይ መጀመርታ ጸገም?,"The correct answer is **A: ናይ ዱኽዒ ካርጎ ዘይምህላዉ (The inability to unload the cargo)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the helicopter transported 120-160 cubic meters of cargo (ሉኖ እንትቕደድን ከቢድ ንፋስን ማዕበልን ናብቲ ዝፈስስ ማይ እንትኣቲዎ). The primary problem described is that the ship was having trouble unloading the cargo ( ኣብ መጀመርያ እቶም ሰራሕተኛታት እቲ ቱቦ ከፍስስ ይኸእል እዩ ኢሎም ፈሪሖም ኔሮም). The fact that the cargo is being affected by strong winds and waves is a *cause* of the problem, but the *problem itself* is the inability to unload the cargo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ማዕበላትን ልዑል ንፋሳትን (Storms and strong winds):** While these are factors affecting the situation, they aren't the *initial* problem.
* **C: ምድፋእ ነዳዲ (Cargo damage):** The text doesn't mention any cargo damage.
* **D: ንኣባላት ሰራሕተኛታት ከጋጥሞም ዝኽእል ሓደጋታት (Hazards that could befall the workers):** The text doesn't specifically highlight worker safety as the primary issue. The unloading problem is the core concern.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ብዛዕባ ዕንወት ሉኖ ሓቒ ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ካብ ዓሰርተ ክልተ ኣባላት ሰራሕተኛታት፡ ሓደ መጉዳእቲ ወሪድዎ (One of the twelve workers fell into the ditch.)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states that the workers were not afraid to operate the hose.** This implies they were successful in filling the silo and that no one fell into the ditch. 
* **Option A (እቲ ዕንወት ቅድሚ ምልዓል ናይቲ ካርጎ ኣጋጢሙ - The leak occurred before the cargo was filled)** is possible. The text doesn't explicitly say *when* the leak happened, only that the workers were operating the hose.
* **Option B (እታ መርከብ ኣብ ግዜ ናይቲ ዕንወት 100 ሜተር ናይ ነዳዲ ኣብ ደገ ነበራ - The ship was 100 meters away from the silo during the leak)** is possible, as the text mentions the ship was operating the hose and its distance from the silo.
* **Option D (እታ መርከብ ናብቲ መዕገቲ ማይ ተደፊኣ - The ship drifted towards the water)** is possible. The text doesn't explicitly state the ship drifted, but that it was operating the hose and potentially facing some challenges.

Therefore, the statement that ""one of the twelve workers fell into the ditch"" is the least likely to be true based on the information given in the text.



"
ኣልጀርያ ኣበየና ክፍለ ዘመን ናጽነታ ረኺባ?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960ታት (1960s)**.

The text states: "" ብ1960ታት ናብታ ሓዳሽ ናጽነታዝኣወጀት ኣልጀርያ ብዛዕባ ፊልሚ ዳይሬክቲንግ ክምህር ተመሊሱ ከይዱ."" which translates to ""In the 1960s, he decided to study film directing in the newly independent Algeria.""

ነቲ ናይ ቐብሪ ስነ-ስርዓት ተለቨጅናት ዘይተዳለዋ ዝነበራ ኣበይ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ኣብ ዝተፈላለየ ናይ ዓዲ-ጥልያን ከተማታት (In various cities of Italy)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""... ኣብ ሮም፣ እቲ ህዝቢ ነቲ ጽንብል ንኽዕዘቦ ኣብ ዝተፈላለየ ከባቢታት ዓበይቲ ናይ ቴለቪዥን መጋረጃታት ተተኺሉ።"" (In Rome, the people watched the ceremony on television screens in various areas of the city).
* This indicates that while the main event was at St. Peter's Basilica (ቐጽሪ ናይ ሰይንት ፒተር), television screens were set up in *various* cities across Italy to allow people to witness it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ መላእ ሮማ (Throughout all of Rome):** The text says *various areas* (ከባቢታት), not *all* of Rome.
* **C: ኣብ ሓድ ሓደ ቦታታት ናይ ፖላንድ (In a few locations in Poland):** The text mentions Poland as one of the countries where similar arrangements were made for people to watch.
* **D: ኣብ ቐጽሪ ናይ ሰይንት ፒተር (At the Basilica of Saint Peter):** The text explicitly says the Basilica was the location of the ceremony, but people watched *elsewhere* via television.



"
እቲ ናይ ቐብሪ ስነ-ስርዓት ኣበይ ተኻይዱ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣብ ዝተፈላለዩ ቦታታት ኣብ መላእ ሮማ (In various locations throughout Rome)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** "" ኣብ'ቲ ቀብሪ ንምርካብ ልዕሊ ኣርባዕተ ሚልዮን ሰባት ናብ ሮም ከይዶም። ዝመፀ ሰብ ብዙሕ ስለዝኮነ ናብቲ ኣብ ቅዱስ ጰጥሮስ ኣደባባይ ዝነበረ ቀብሪ ክኣትዉ ኣይከኣሉን። ኣብ ሮም፣ እቲ ህዝቢ ነቲ ጽንብል ንኽዕዘቦ ኣብ ዝተፈላለየ ከባቢታት ዓበይቲ ናይ ቴለቪዥን መጋረጃታት ተተኺሉ ነይሩ。"" (Over four million people did not come to Rome for the funeral. Because so many people had passed away, they could not go to the tomb at St. Peter's Basilica. In Rome, the people watched the ceremony on television screens in various areas of the city to pay their respects.)

This indicates the ceremony wasn't confined to St. Peter's Basilica but took place in various locations *throughout Rome* so that people could witness it.

* **Option C ( ኣብ ቐጽሪ ናይ ሰይንት ፒተር - At St. Peter's Basilica):** The passage explicitly says people *could not* go to St. Peter's Basilica due to the large number of mourners.

* **Options B and D:** The passage mentions the ceremony was televised in Poland, but doesn't state the main ceremony took place there. Also, while there may have been a ceremony initially in Rome, the passage stresses it was broadcast across the city.



"
ድሕሪ እቲ ባርዕ፡ ንከበድቲ መጉዳእትታት መን ተሓኪሙ?,"The correct answer is **C: ናይ ጋዝ ወጋዓዊ ትካል (The gas company)**.

The text states that a representative of the gas company arrived at the scene and the electrical panel was switched off.  This implies the gas company is responsible for investigating the cause of the leak and the incident.  While the neighbors were affected, the gas company's actions are directly tied to the problem.
"
ነቲ ናይ ጋዝ ምልሓኹ መን ሓበሬታ ሂቡ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣብቲ ህንጻ ዝነበረ ጎረቤት (The neighbor who was in the building)**.

The text states: ""ሓደ ብዓል ስልጣን ናይቲ ኩባንያ ነዳዲ ሓደ ጐረቤቱ ብዛዕባ ዘልሕዅ ጋዝ ምስ ጸውዐ ናብቲ ቦታ ጸብጻብ ኣቕረበ"" which translates to ""A company official, upon receiving a report from one of his neighbors about gas, went to the location.""

Therefore, the neighbor is the one who reported the gas leak.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ክንደይ ዝኣኽሉ ሰባት ኣብቲ መጥቓዕቲ ሞይቶም?,"The correct answer is **C: 5**.

The text states: ""ኡካ ናብ ርእሲ ሓደ ሓምሻይ ሰብኣይ እናመላኸተ ኸሎ ፈሸለ"" which translates to ""He called to the head of one fifth of the people"". Therefore, there were 5 people involved.
"

The text states: ""ኤድጋር ቬጊላ ናይ ክርኒ ኢድን መንጋጋ ቁስልን ዝተድጎድአ ኮይኑ ክርስቶፈር ሽናይደር ግን ገጹ እንደገና ናይ ምህናጽ መጥባሕቲ ምግባር የድልዮ ። **މሳርያ ኡካ ናብ ርእሲ ሓደ ሓምሻይ ሰብኣይ እናመላኸተ ኸሎ ፈሸለ**。"" This translates to: ""Edgar Vega had a neck injury, while Christopher Schneider preferred to work on computers. **The car crashed into the side of the car as it was going around a corner.**"" Since the car crashed, and Zakari Kudebak was the driver, the car belonged to Kudebak.



"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ስፖርትታት ካብ መደብ ኦሎምፒክ ዝወጸ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ራግቢ (Rugby)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Rugby was proposed to be included in the Olympics, but it was *not* included in the 2005 cut of sports being considered for removal from the Olympic program.  The other options (Squash, Baseball, Karate) *were* considered for removal.
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ስፖርትታት እቶም ኣህጉራዊ ናይ ኦሎምፒክ ኮሚተታት ናብ ግጥማት ንኽጽንር ድምጺ ዝሃቡ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሮለር ስፖርትታት (Roller sports)**.

The text states that squash, karate, roller sports, baseball, and softball were considered for removal from the Olympic program in 2005.  It also mentions that rugby and golf were proposed for inclusion.  Therefore, roller sports were one of the sports being considered for *removal*, not for being supported by national Olympic committees for inclusion.
"
ኣርተር ጊነስ ፈለማ ነቲ ቕዱስ ጄምስ ኣፍደገ መፍረዩ ቢራ ንኽንደይ ዓመታት ተኻርይዎ?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The passage states: ""ድሕሪ 250 ዓመታት..."" which translates to ""After 250 years...""  This refers to the time period between the founding of the Guinness brewery and Guinness becoming a global leader.
"
ጊነስ ኣብ ነፍሲ ወከፍ ዓመት ክንደይ ዝኣክል ቢልዮን ዶላራት የእቱ?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states: ""ጊነስ ዓመታዊ ልዕሊ 10 ቢልዮን ኤውሮ (14.7 ቢልዮን ዶላር ኣሜሪካ) እቶት ዘለዎ ዓለምለኻዊ ንግዲ ኮይኑ。""  This translates to ""Guinness is an international giant with annual revenue of over 10 billion euros (14.7 billion US dollars).""  Therefore, the question is asking about the value of Guinness, and the text gives the figure of 14.7 billion US dollars.
"
ኣብ ሕቡራት ኤሮፓ ኣብ ክንደይ ዝኣኽላ ሃገራት እቲ ቫይረስ H5N1 ተለልዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ሸሞንተ (Eight)**.

The text states that France is an EU member bordering Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and **Croatia** (which is implied by the mention of Croatia being not affected). That's a total of eight countries.
"
ናይ H5N1 ቫይረስ ኣብ ቐረባ እዋን ዝተለልየሉ ቦታ ኣበይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ፈረንሳ (France)**.

The text states that the H5N1 virus was confirmed to have killed poultry in France, near Lyon in the Marche region of western France. It also mentions that the virus had previously been detected in Croatia and Denmark, but not confirmed in those countries.
"

The text states: ""ወታደራት ቅድሚ ምብጽሖም ሃይቲ ካብ 1800 ታት ጀሚሩ ምስቲ ሕማም ዝተተሓሓዙ ጸገማት ኣጋጢሞማ ኣይፈልጡን"" which translates to ""The soldiers before their arrival were not aware of problems associated with the disease since 1800.""  This directly indicates the issue existed *before* the earthquake.



"
ካበየናይ ቦታ ዝመጸ ጎሓፍ እዩ ኣብ ምልባዕ ናይቲ ሕማም ኢድ ዝነበሮ?,"The correct answer is **A: እቲ ፈለግ ኣርቲቦኔይት (The *E. coli* bacteria)**.

The text explicitly states: ""ከም እቲ ናይ ሕጊ ምጉት ተኾይኑ ካብ ናይ ዩኤን ዝወጽእ ጉሓፍ ብስርዓቱ ስለዘይተወገደ ባክተርያ ናብ ሃይቲ ዝዓበየ ሩባ ኣርቲቦናይት ባክተርያታት ክኣትዉ ጌሩ እዩ।"" (As if it were a legal loophole, the bacteria that came to Haiti from the UN mission, because it was not integrated into the system, were *E. coli* bacteria.)
"
እቲ ናይ ኣይሪሽ መንግስቲ እንታይ ክገብር እዩ መደብ ዘለዎ?,"The correct answer is **A: ንናይ ሓሽሽ ገበነኛታት ፍርዲ ክህብ (To ensure the rights of the affected farmers).**

Here's why:

The text states the government is working to resolve the crisis ""with a dedicated body in Parliament.""  A key statement is that it's crucial to ""take the law as much as possible to those who have been harmed"" (referring to the farmers). The Minister of Agriculture emphasizes that the government is addressing the issues caused by illegal changes and the resulting ""disruptive impact"" (which affects the farmers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ተፈቓድነት ናይ ሓሽሽ ኣዝዮም ተረርቲ ዝኾኑ ሕግታት ከተኣታቱ (To promote laws that are conducive to illegal farming):**  This is the opposite of what the government is doing.
* **C: ኣብ ተፈቓድነት ናይ ሓሽሻት ሕግታት ከፍኹሶም (To increase the permissiveness of illegal laws):** Again, this is the opposite of the government's stated intention.
* **D: ሓሽሻት ገበን ምዃኖም ከቛርጾም (To declare illegal farming):** While the government is addressing illegal changes, the focus isn't just on declaring farming illegal, but on the rights of those affected and finding a solution.



"
ኣብ ኣይርላንድ ንግዚኡ ሕጋዊ ዝኾነ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ሓሽሽት (Fraud)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the government is taking action against organizations that ""misuse the legal status of substances"" and against ""unconstitutional changes"" that are intertwined with **""ሓሽሽ"" (fraud)**. 

Therefore, the government is addressing issues related to fraud.
"
ዝተጠርጠር ገበነኛ ንምንታይ እዩ ዝጻረ?,"The correct answer is **A: ንምጥሓስ (Disrespect)**.

The text states the suspect was writing on a wall ""above the ground"" and the symbol was a peace and love sign, but it was done ""with a spray paint in an aggressive manner."" This indicates the act was meant as a disrespectful gesture, not related to physical disability, meaning, or theft."
እቲ ምልክት ድሕሪ ምቕያር፡ እቲ ጥርጡር እንታይ ኣይገበረን?,"The correct answer is **A: ሓደ ካብቲ ቓላቱ ቐይሩ (He changed one of its letters)**.

The passage states the symbol was altered by changing the ""O"" to an ""e"". Therefore, one of its letters was changed.
"

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Professor Karno used offensive language in the classroom and on school buses, and that he was known to use complicated words. It also mentions that he was criticized for forcing the English language on students and disregarding previous pedagogical approaches.  

However, the text **doesn't** say he *didn't* allow freedom of expression.  It describes his *use* of language as problematic, not a restriction on students' freedom to express themselves. The other options are all things the text indicates he *did* engage in:

*   **A: ምግሃስ መሰል ቕዳሕ (Giving harsh lessons):** The text mentions criticisms of his teaching methods.
*   **B: ተማሃሪት ብዕርክነት ምዉጻእ (Forcing students to learn):**  The text specifically states he was accused of forcing the English language on students.
*   **D: ኣብ ክፍሊ ርኹስ ቛንቛ ምጥቓም (Using language in a classroom):** The text describes his use of language, both complicated and offensive, in the classroom.



Therefore, the only option that the text doesn't indicate he engaged in is granting freedom of expression.



"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጽሑፍ፡ ብሮላንዶ መንዶዛ ጅሆ ዘይተወስደ መን እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ወትሃደር ፖሊስ (Police officer)**.

The text states: ""ሮናልዶ ሜንዶዛ ንበፃሕቲ ብኤም16 ጥይት ተኲሱሎም። ብዙሓት ተታሒዞም ዝነበሩ ክድሕኑ ከለዉ ብንእሽተዩ 6 ክዓ ከምዝሞቱ ተረጋጊጹ ኣሎ። ፊሊፒናውያን ፎቶ ሰአልቲ፣ ህፃናትን ሽማግለታትን ወሲኹ 6 ተዓጊቶም ዝነበሩ እሱራት ቅድም ኢሎም ተፈቲሖም እዮም። ጸኒሖም እቶም ሰኣልቲ ኣብ ክንዲ ሓንቲ ብዕድመ ዝደፍአት ሰበይቲ መሕጸቢ ኽፍሊ ኽትደሊ ኸላ ተተክኡ ። ሜንዶዛ ብጥይት ተወቂዑ。""

This translates to: ""Ronaldo Mendoza shot at the BM16 in the morning. Many who were injured died within a few hours, it was confirmed that about 6 died. Filipinos, who had been robbed of photos, children, and the elderly, and had 6 women assaulted, had never before been subjected to this. The robbers, who had been in a heavily armed section, fled. Mendoza was shot.""

The text explicitly says **"" ሜንዶዛ ብጥይት ተወቂዑ"" (Mendoza was shot)**, indicating he was a police officer and was shot.  Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"
ኣብቲ መግለጺ ምርኩስ ብምግባር፡ ቐልጢፎም ከም ዝተለቑ ዘይተረጋገጸሎም ጅሆ ዝተታሕዙ ሰባት ኣየኖት ነበሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: እቶም ገያሾ (The robbers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Filipino police shot at the Hong Kong tourists *because* of robbers (the *gyasho*). The question asks who was shot at but not confirmed to be injured. The passage clearly indicates the tourists were shot at, but it doesn't confirm the extent of their injuries.  The robbers, on the other hand, were definitively shot at by the police. Therefore, the robbers are the group whose injuries are not confirmed in the text.
"

Here's why:

The text states that the Roman Catholic Church in Brazil opposes same-sex marriage. It also mentions that the current law is being challenged in the National Congress. The question asks who is *responsible for opposing* the legalization of same-sex marriage. Therefore, the opponents are the ones who filed the petition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ሮበርቶ ጀፍርሶን (Roberto Jefferson):** He is mentioned as the sponsor of the current bill, not someone opposing same-sex marriage.
*   **C: እቲ ናይ ሮማ ናይ ካቶሊኽ ቤተ-ክርስትያን (The Roman Catholic Church):** While the Church opposes same-sex marriage, the question asks who is *responsible for filing the petition* to legalize it.
*   **D: ማርታ ሱፕሊስይ (Marta Suplicy):** She is mentioned as the author of the previous law (which was later repealed), not someone opposing the legalization of same-sex marriage.



"
እቶም ተቓወምቲ ጥርዓኖም ንመን ክህቡ እዮም?,"The correct answer is **A: እቲ ናይ ሮማ ናይ ካቶሊኽ ቤተ-ክርስትያን** (The Roman Catholic Church).

The text states that the Brazilian Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage and is lobbying the National Congress to maintain the current legal status. Therefore, the opponents are the Roman Catholic Church.

Here's why:

The passage states that after 5 minutes of calm, the wind started and then quickly became very strong (70 km/h). It describes the wind as being so strong it felt like a ""stampede of horses."" Armand Versace describes seeing people struggling and being pushed around. This indicates the immediate feedback the people received was the presence of strong winds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ክዘንብ ጀሚሩ (It started to rain):** The passage mentions rain *later*, after the strong winds. The immediate reaction was to the wind.
*   **B: እቲ ምርኢት ሓሙሽተ ደቓይቕ ደንጉዩ ነበረ (The camera recorded for 5 minutes):** This is irrelevant to what the people *observed*.
*   **D: ኣባል ስድሩኡ ጠፊእዎ (A family member fell):** While people were struggling and falling, the passage doesn't say a specific family member fell. The general observation was the strong winds and the resulting chaos.



"
ብመሰረት ቨርሳች፡ እቶም ዝበርትዑ ንፋስ መዓስ ጀሚሮም?,"The correct answer is **B: ድሕሪ እቲ ዝናብ (After the rain)**.

The text states: ""ብድሕሪኡ ዝናብ መጺዩ..."" which translates to ""Afterwards the rain came..."" and then describes the wind restarting after the rain.
"
ቅድሚ ፍረድ፡ ምብራቕ ናይ 35° ምዕ ክንደይ ማዕበል ተመዝጊቦም?,"The answer is **D: ሓደ**

Here's why:

The text states that Fred is located 35°W (35 degrees West) from the ""third major hurricane"" from satellite imagery.  The question asks how many degrees East of the Equator that location is. Since the location is 35° West, it means it is 35° East of the Equator (because longitude measures East/West). Therefore, the answer is 1 (representing 35 degrees).
"
ፍረድ ኣብ ጥቓ ደሴታት ኬፕ ቨርደ ድሕሪ ምቕማጡ፡ ናበየናይ ኣንፈት ይጉዓዝ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ምዕራብ** (West).

The passage states: ""ፍሬድ ሕጂ ሰዓት ብሰዓት 105 ማይልስ (165 ኪ.ሜ. ብሰዓት) ንፋሳት ዘለውዎ ኮይኑ፣ ንኣንፈት ሰሜን ምዕራብን እንዳተጓዓዘ ይርከብ።""  This translates to: ""Fred is currently a storm moving at 105 mph (165 km/h) with winds blowing from the north-northwest, heading southwest.""  Therefore, after passing Cape Verde Islands, Fred was moving towards the **west**.
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ካብቶም ቅድሚኦም ዝነበሩ ዝለዓለ መጠን ፍጥነት ዘለዎም ኣየኖት እዮም?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The text states that 802.11n offers a significantly increased data rate of 600 Mbit/s compared to its predecessors.  802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a all have lower data rates.
"
ነቲ 802.11n ብድሕሪት ምስ 802.11b ተወዳደሪ ንምዃን እንታይ የገድሶ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣዝዮም ቕልጡፋት ፍጥነታት (Much faster speeds)**.

Here's why:

* **802.11n's key advantage over 802.11b is its significantly faster speeds.** 802.11n offers a theoretical maximum speed of 600 Mbps, while 802.11b has a maximum speed of 11 Mbps.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ክእለት ናይ 802.11b ኣብ 5.0Ghz ክትዓዩ (Capability of 802.11b to operate in 5.0Ghz):** 802.11b operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency, not 5.0 GHz.  802.11n *can* operate on both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz.
* **C: ዉጺኢት ናይ 600ሜጋባይት/ካ (Output of 600 Megabit/s):** While the output *is* 600 Mbps, this is a *result* of the faster speeds, not the *reason* it's better than 802.11b.
* **D: ክልተ ራድዮታት (Two radios):** Having two radios (for MIMO - Multiple Input Multiple Output) is *part* of what enables the faster speeds of 802.11n, but the primary reason for being better is the speed itself.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate reason 802.11n is better than 802.11b is its much faster speeds.

The text explicitly states: ""እቲ ናይ ኦሎምፒክ ወርቂ መዳልያ ተዓዋቲ ኣብ 100 ሜ ን 200 ሜ ን ብሰለስተ ውድድራት አብ ፀወታት ኮሞንዌልዝ ክሕምስ ዋላ እኳ እንተነበረ ተደጋጋሚ ምስ ምሕማሙ ጥንካረ ሰውነቱ አብ ጥርጥር ኣትዩ。"" which translates to: ""The Olympic gold medalist in 100m and 200m has only been able to win five times in the Commonwealth Games despite his/her consistency.""

እቲ ናይ ኦሎምፒክ ተዓዋቲ ወርቒ ማዳልያ ንቓንዙኡ ስለምንታይ መድሃኒት ኣይወስድን ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ንብቕዓቱ ብኣሉታዊ መንገዲ ከይጸልዎ ስለ ዘተሓሳሰቦ (because his physical condition wasn't improved in a fundamental way).**

Here's why:

The passage states that the Olympic gold medalist's strength was in question despite winning multiple medals. It also mentions that he couldn't take performance-enhancing drugs because the sports he competed in prohibit them. The implication is that he didn't need drugs because his inherent physical condition was already exceptional.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቓንዛ ኣይነበሮን (He wasn't sick):** The passage doesn't say he was sick.
*   **B: ስለ ዘሕመሞ (Because he was sick):**  Same as above, the passage doesn't state he was ill.
*   **D: ኣብ ግጥማት ሓባራዊ ሃብቲ ኣይፍቐድን እዩ (He wasn't qualified for the national team):** The passage doesn't discuss his qualification for a national team.

The passage states: ""ብትኽክል ነታጒ ከምዝፈንደአ እቲ ደመና ምድንጋር ፈጢሩ ይርከብ"" which translates to ""The ash cloud is said to have caused the earthquake.""  The passage also mentions ""ስ ምስ ዝኾነ ይኹን እሳተ-ጎመራዊ ንጥፈታት ዘይተሓሓዝ ጸልማት ደበና ኣብ እግሪ እቲ ጎቦ ከም ዝነበረ ጸብጻብ ተዋሂቡ ኢዩ."" which translates to ""However, a cloud of ash, unrelated to the craters, formed above the volcano's rim.""

Therefore, the earthquake was caused by a cloud of ash.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጸብጻባት ካብ ኣይስላንዲክ ቤት-ጽሕፈት ስነ ኣየራዊ (Observations from the Icelandic Meteorological Office):** While the Meteorological Office is mentioned, the earthquake *caused* the ash cloud, not the other way around.
* **C: እቲ ኣህጉራዊ ካርታ ናይ ምንቕጥቓጥ ምድሪ (The global map of seismic activity):** The global map is mentioned as a source of information about seismic activity, but it didn't *cause* the earthquake.
* **D: ኣብ ካልእ ቦታታት ናይ ኣይስላንድ ጸብጻብ ዝተወሃበሎም ንጥፈት (Observations that have been carried out in other places in Iceland):** The passage specifically describes the ash cloud forming *above* the volcano, not in other places.

**A: እቲ ነቲ ድህሰሳ ዝጀመረ መንኮርኮር ሰራሕተኛ ነይረሞ (The spacecraft that started the mission was manned).**

Here's why:

*   **Chandrayaan-1 was an uncrewed mission.** It was an unmanned lunar probe. The other options are accurate descriptions of the mission.
    *   **B: እቲ ድህሰሳ ኣገደስቲ መሳርሒታት ነበርዎ (The mission had significant instruments):** Chandrayaan-1 carried various scientific instruments.

    *   **D: እቲ ዳህሳሲ ዝተለኸዩ ጎንታት ነበሮ (The probe had multiple sides):** Chandrayaan-1 had multiple sides, each adorned with the Indian flag.

Therefore, option A is the statement that is incorrect.

* The passage explicitly states: ""ሰለስተ ኣገደስቲ ናይ ሳይንስ ናውቲታት ካብ ምሕቋፍ ብተወሳኺ እቲ ናይ ወርሒ ምርምር መግበሪ መሳርሒ ኣብ ኩሉ ጎንታቱ ናይ ህንዲ ባንዲራ ስእሊታት ዝሓዘ እዩ।"" (Three national emblems, in addition to the lunar exploration vehicle, adorned the entire spacecraft with the Indian flag.)
* Option D directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ጥቓ ሰሜን ጫፍ ናይ ወርሒ ዓሊቡ (Near the north rim of the Moon's crater)**: The passage doesn't mention the location of landing relative to any crater rim.
* **B: ምዕላቡ ዕዉት ነበረ (Its top was barren)**: The passage doesn't mention the appearance of the spacecraft's top.
* **C: ካብ ስሩዕ ዓንኬል ዝወጸ እዩ (It descended from a powerful rocket)**: While technically true (it was launched from a rocket), the passage focuses on its landing and the flags, not its launch.

The passage explicitly states: ""... መንግስቲ ህንዲ ኣብ ቀንዲ ዝተጸልዉ ቦታታት ሓሰማታት ክህደኑ፣ ኣሽሓት ላምስያታት ክዕደሉን ጸረ-ጣንጡ መድሃኒታት ድማ ክንጸጉר ስጉምታት ንምውሳድ ተገዲዱ።"" This translates to ""... the government of India decided to eradicate malaria in key locations, distribute millions of antimalarial tablets, and increase the production of anti-malaria drugs to eradicate the disease.""

The passage focuses on the **antimalarial** efforts as the primary system for addressing and eradicating the disease. The other options are not directly mentioned as core components of the response:

*   **B: መትሓዚ ሓሸማ (Malaria diagnosis)** While important, it's a *part* of the strategy, not the overarching system of eradication.
*   **C: ክታበታት ናይ ኢንሰፈላይትን (Encephalitis vaccinations)** Not related to malaria.
*   **D: ላምስያ ናይ ጣንጡ (Mosquito nets)** While mentioned as something to distribute, the focus is on the *tablets* and *antimalarial drugs* as the core system.

The text states: ""ነቲ ሕማም ዝሽከሞ ሓሰማ ኮይኑ、 ካብኡ ብጣንጡ ኣቢሉ ናብ ወዲ ሰብ ፈሊሱ。"" which translates to ""The disease is transmitted through mosquitoes, it spreads from it through the bite to humans."" 

Therefore, the disease is spread through mosquitoes.

Here's why:

The passage states that the second ruling paving the way for future civil unions for same-sex couples could open the door for future civil unions to be established.  Option B directly reflects this potential impact – it suggests the ruling creates a legal basis or example (precedent) for future recognition of same-sex unions.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: ቐጥታዊ ገምጋም ናይ HJR-3 (A direct amendment of HJR-3):** The passage says HJR-3 might be revisited in 2015/2016, but it doesn't say the second ruling *directly* amends it.
*   **C: ናይ ህጹጽ ሓጋጊ ክፍለ-ግዜ (A full-time transition):** This is too vague and doesn't relate to the specific legal impact of the rulings.
*   **D: ምኽልካል ናይ ሕብረት ነበርቲ ሓደ-ጾታ (A limitation on same-sex unions):** The passage actually suggests the *opposite* – the ruling could *expand* the potential for civil unions.

The text states: ""እቲ ካልኣይ ፍርዲ ፋልማይ ብቤት ምኽሪ ተወከልቲ ሕዝቢ እንደገና ብሰኔት ብተመሳሳሊ ቅጥዒ ብሰኑይ ድሕሪ ምስራዙ፣ ኣብ'ዚ መደብ ምህንጻጽ ሕጊ ለውጢ ተኻይዱ."" (The second Falmay verdict, after being re-represented by the House of Representatives in the Senate with the same wording after its passage, led to the amendment of laws in this area.)  This implies the legal amendments happened *after* the second verdict and during the relevant legislative period.

While 2011 and 2015/2016 are mentioned as dates related to the process, they don't represent when the *second thought/opinion* was reconsidered. The reconsideration happened during the legislative period following the second verdict.

Here's why:

* The question asks which crash had the highest death toll.
* The text states that the plane crash from Iran to Armenia, which killed all 168 passengers, was ""ናይ ኣየር ሓደጋ እዩ ነይሩ"" (a major air disaster) and a rare event in Iran.
* The other crashes are mentioned as incidents but their death tolls are not as high. The police helicopter crash killed 3, and the train collision killed 17.

Therefore, the plane crash from Iran to Armenia with 168 fatalities is the one with the highest death toll.
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ነቲ ኣብ ኢራን ዘጋጥሙ ሓያሎ ናይ ኣየር ሓደጋታት ምኽንያት ዘይኮነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ዝኣረገ ጭፍራ ናይ ህዝብን ዉትህድርናን ነፈርቲ (Disregard for civilian and federal regulations regarding aircraft)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ንሲቪላዊን ወተሃደራዊን በረራታት ዘገልግሉ፣ ደረጃ ዘይሓለዉ ኣረግቶት ነፈርቲ ዘለዋ ኢራን መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ሓደጋታት ኣየር የጋጥማ"" (Iran, with aircraft that disregard civilian and federal regulations, often experiences air accidents). This directly links the disregard for regulations to the air accidents.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: ሕጽረት ገንዘብ ሓደስቲ ነፈርቲ ንምግዛእ ዘፍቕድ (Lack of funds to purchase new aircraft):** While a lack of funds *could* contribute to accidents, the passage doesn't mention this as a primary reason.  The focus is on *disregarding regulations*.
* **C: ሓደስቲ ነፈርቲ ምግዛእ ዝኽልክል እገዳ (Embargo preventing the purchase of new aircraft):** The passage doesn't mention an embargo.
* **D: ድኹም ኣተሓሕዛ ዘለዎ ጭፍራ ናይ ነፈርቲ (Poor quality of aircraft):**  The passage says the aircraft are not following regulations, not necessarily that the aircraft are poor quality. It could be that even decent quality aircraft are being operated without adherence to safety protocols.



Therefore, the most direct and supported answer from the passage is A.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions several policy areas discussed in the Iraq Study Group report, including:

*   **Preventing a holy war and extremism.**
*   **Rebuilding Iraq's economy.**
*   **Restoring diplomatic ties.**
*   **Negotiating a resolution with Iraq regarding the Middle East.**
*   **Avoiding a conflict with Iraq.**

However, the text does **not** mention nuclear policy as a key area of discussion.

Options B, C, and D *are* mentioned in the text:

*   **B: Addressing the threat of terrorism and preventing escalation of violence in Iraq.**
*   **C: Providing recommendations for Iraq's leaders.**
*   **D: Seeking a consensus on American policy.**



"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣብቲ ጸብጻብ ናይ ዒራቕ ጉጅለ መጽናዕቲ ድፊኢት ዘይተገበረሉ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: መረጋገጺ ዝዉስኽ ዘሎ ጎነጽ ደዉ ንኽብል ኣዋጅ ክእወጅ (Confirming a truce)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the report emphasizes the need to *avoid* actions that could escalate conflict or be interpreted as aggression.  Confirming a truce would be a step *towards* de-escalation, not something the report warns against.  In fact, the report highlights the importance of preventing enemy attacks and re-establishing diplomatic ties, which a truce would facilitate.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as points in the report:

* **B: ቐጥታዊ ምቕያር ናይ ኣንፈት (Strictly tightening sanctions):** The report emphasizes a *critical review* of current policies, including sanctions, suggesting a possible loosening or modification.
* **C: ምጥቓም ክፉት ክትዕ (Avoiding aggression):** This is a central theme, explicitly stated in the text.
* **D: ምምስራት ሓድሽ ዲፕሎማቲካ ተበግሶ (Initiating a new diplomatic engagement):** The report highlights this as the *first* recommendation among the 78 points, emphasizing its importance.

This means Giovanni Falcone died *during* the war led by Brina, and Paolo Borsellino was later sentenced for Falcone's death. Option A best reflects this information.

The text explicitly states that Hitoshi Saito was a two-time Olympic gold medalist and the chairman of the Japan Judo Federation's training committee. It also mentions he was a Judo expert. However, it *doesn't* mention him being a two-time World Champion. Therefore, this is the correct answer as it's the only option not mentioned in the provided text.



"
ኢዋሳኪ ማሕላ ካብ ምዉሳድ ኣበይ ከወግድ ክኢሉ?,"The correct answer is **D: ቲበት**.

The question asks where Iwasaki was imprisoned. The passage states: "" ኣብ ቲቤት ብዕቡድ ከልቢ ተነኺሱ"" which translates to ""he was imprisoned in Tibet"".
"
ንኢዋሳኪ መን ኣጥቒዕዎ?,"The correct answer is **A: በዓል-ቤቱ (His father)**.

The text states: ""ብናይ ባሕሪ ሰረቕቲ ተሰሪቑ፣ ኣብ ቲቤት ብዕቡድ ከልቢ ተነኺሱ፣ ኣብ ኔፓል ካብ መርዓ ኣምሊጡ ከምኡ ድማ ኣብ ህንዲ እውን ተኣሲሩ ነይሩ እዩ።"" which translates to: ""He encountered problems in many instances: he was arrested by the coastal police, he was taken to Tibet in a difficult manner, he was arrested in Nepal from his wedding, and he was also imprisoned."" 

The question asks who rescued Iwasaki. The answer, while not explicitly stated in the provided text, is implied by the common narrative surrounding Iwasaki's life, which is that his father (በዓል-ቤቱ) intervened to secure his release from the difficult situations he faced.

Therefore, **A: በዓል-ቤቱ (His father)** is the most logical answer.
"

Here's why:

* The text states: ""ማይክል ሹማቸር ኣብቲ ቕድድም ኣብ እተገብረ ሓያላት ውግኣት ጉድኣት ስለ ዘጋጠሞ ድሕሪ ኣሎንሶ ነዊሕ ከይጸንሐ ጉይኡ ዛዘመ ።"" This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher had a problem with the grip in the turn, and after Alonso didn't maintain his lead, he spun out.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሹሁማቸር ናይ ቅድሚት ጎማኡ ድሕሪ ምዕናዉ (Schumacher spun out after his previous tire).** - This is not directly mentioned in the text.
* **B: ፊሽቸላ ቑጽጽር ናይ መኪናኡ ኣጥፊኡ (Fischiell damaged his car's front).** - The text says Fischiell damaged his car *before* the turn.
* **D: ቅድሚ ምምርሑ (Before the race).** - This is completely unrelated to the events described in the text.

Therefore, the problem was with his car's steering, leading to him spinning out.

Here's why:

The passage states that the temporary order was issued because the prisoners had been held for over 24 hours *without* hearing from the court commissioner. The passage then mentions that the commissioners are checking the national computer system and that the court is currently open for the defendant's bail hearing. 

This implies that the prisoners are seeking bail *through a formal legal process*, specifically a bail approved by a judge. Options A, B, and D are not directly supported by the passage.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that diplomats found nothing in the Afghan constitution that would prevent the additional draft from being adopted and that previous reports had argued the new draft was unconstitutional. The core issue is the constitutional conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: ሓደጋታት ጸጥታ (Security threats):** While security threats might be a concern in Afghanistan, the passage doesn't directly link them to why the draft wasn't approved.
*   **C: ልዑል ወጻኢታት (Powerful foreign powers):** The passage doesn't mention foreign powers as a factor.
*   **D: ሕገ መንግስታዊ ዘይንጹርነት (Lack of constitutional clarity):** While related to B, the passage specifically highlights the *unconstitutionality* argument raised in previous reports.

The passage states: ""ዲፕሎማሲያዊያን ኣብ ሕገ-መንግስቲ ኣፍጋኒስታን ነቲ መረፃ ኣድላዪ ከምዘይኾነ ዝገልጽ ዘሻምይ ነገር ከምዝረኸቡ ገሊጾም እዮም። እዚ ምስ እቶም ነቲ ዳግመ መረጻ ክቋረጽ ምግባር ኢ-ሕገመንግስታዊ እዩ ዝብሉ ቅድም ክብል ዝወጹ ጸብጻባት ዝጋጮ እዩ।""

This translates to: ""Diplomats have stated that they have found nothing in the constitution that indicates the additional draft is beneficial. This echoes previous reports that reiterated that amending the constitution is unconstitutional.""

Therefore, the diplomats saw the draft as unconstitutional *because it wasn't enshrined in the constitution*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣንጻር ሕገ መንግስቲ እዩ ነይሩ (It was contrary to the constitution):** While related, the core issue isn't that it *directly* contradicted the constitution, but that it wasn't *permitted* within it.
* **B: ጸጥታዊ ሓደጋታት ነይሩ (There were security threats):** The passage doesn't mention security threats.
* **D: እቲ መረጻ ኣዝዩ ክቡር እዩ ነይሩ (The draft was very valuable):** The passage explicitly states the diplomats found nothing *beneficial* about the draft.

These agents, under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution, are tasked with providing services of establishment to the government and judicial authorities.""

Therefore, the political agents are the ones responsible for providing the judicial service.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ብዛዕባ “ፖለቲካዊ ወኪላት” ፋታ ዝተዋህበ መግለጺታት ኣየናይ እዩ ሓቂ ዘይኮነ?,"The correct answer is **D: ኣብ ዝተወሰነ ከባቢታት ምሉእ ቁጽጽር ኣለዎም (Have jurisdiction in limited areas)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** "" ኣብ ፋታ ኣብቲ ቦታ ምሉእ ብምሉእ ናይ ምግዛእ ቁጽጽር “በዓል ሞያ ፖለቲከኛ ወከልቲ” መሪጹ"" (In FATA, a complete presidential order was issued to establish ""Political Agents""). This implies they have authority *within FATA*, not limited to specific areas within FATA.

* **The passage also states:** "" ኣብ ትሕቲ ናይ ፓኪስታን ሕገ-መንግስቲ ዓንቀጽ 247 ተመርኵዞም ኣገልግሎታት ናይ ምቕራብ ሓላፍነት ኣለዎም"" (They have the responsibility to perform services of reconciliation under Article 247 of the Constitution of Pakistan). This indicates a broader mandate than just limited jurisdiction.

* **Options A, B, and C are all consistent with the passage:**
    * **A: ኣገልግሎት ፍርዲ ይህቡ (Provide service of reconciliation):**  The passage explicitly mentions this responsibility.
    * **B: ብፕረዚደንት ፓኪስታን ዝተመርጹ እዮም (Are appointed by the President of Pakistan):** The passage states the order was issued *by the President*.
    * **C: ንሕገ መንግስቲ ፓኪስታን ይኽተሉ (Are bound by the Constitution of Pakistan):** The passage mentions their responsibilities are under Article 247 of the Constitution.



Therefore, the statement that is *not* true according to the passage is that they have jurisdiction in limited areas. They have jurisdiction *within* FATA, not limited to specific parts of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ኢሺካዋ ዝርከብ መዓርፎ ነፈርቲ (Narita Airport in Ishikawa):** The passage mentions Narita Airport in Ishikawa as an affected area, but not as something that was in operation after the earthquake.
* **C: ኩሉ ናይ ባቡር ኣገልግሎት (All railway services):** The passage mentions railway services being disrupted, but not that *all* railway services were in operation after the earthquake.
* **D: ኣብ ኒጋታ ዝርከብ ትካል መመንጨዊ ሓይሊ ኤሌክትሪክ (The electric power company located in Niigata):**  While the plant is located in Niigata Prefecture, the passage specifically states the *Shiikawa* plant was operating.

The passage explicitly states: "" ኣብ ውሽጢ እቲ ክልል፣ ከባቢ 9400 ዝኾኑ ገዛውቲ ማይ ከምዘይብሎምን ብግምት 100 ዝኾኑ ገዛውቲ መብራህቲ ከምዘይብሎምን ተጸብጺቡ። ገለ ጽርግያታት ተሃስዮም ኣለው، ኣብቶም ዝተጸልዉ ኣከባቢታት ናይ መንገዲ ባቡር ኣገልግሎት ተቋሪጹ ከምኡ'ውን ኣብ ኣውራጃ ኢሺካዋ ዝርከብ ኖቶ ኤርፖርት ተዓጽዩ እዩ ዘሎ。"" (Within the prefecture, there are approximately 9400 rice fields and 100 orchards. There are certain areas affected, where railway services have been established and Noto Airport located in Ishikawa Prefecture is affected.)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: ገለ ኣባይቲ (Certain houses)** - The passage doesn't mention houses being affected.
*   **B: ኣብ ፋብሪካ ሺካ ክልተ ሪኣክተራት (Two reactors at the Shika factory)** - The passage mentions the reactors, but not as being a consequence of the land subsidence.
*   **D: መዓርፎ ነፈርቲ ኖቶ (Noto Airport)** - The passage states Noto Airport is *affected* by the land subsidence, not that the land subsidence *caused* the airport.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions the Israeli desire for a peace agreement, the PA's attempts to extend it, and the history of the 1967 war related to the territories.
* It also highlights the Israeli military presence in the West Bank after the peace agreement fell apart.
* The text discusses the future of Jerusalem.
* However, it **doesn't mention the future of floods** at all.

Therefore, option D is the only topic not covered in the provided text."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሓደ ኻብቲ ፍልስጤም ዝሓተተቶ ነገር ዘይኰነ ኣየናይ ኢዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ናይ ሓሙሽተ ዓመት ወተሃደራዊ ህላወ ኣብ ጎልጎል ዮርዳኖስ (Five-year military occupation in the Jordan Valley)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""... እስራኤል ትደልዮ ስምምዕ ምስተፈረመ, ኣብ'ቲ ወሽመጥ ውሽጢ ቀጻልነት ዘለዎ ንዓሰርተ ዓመታት ወተሃደራዊ ህላዌ ኮይኑ..."" (After the desired peace agreement, Israel maintained a military occupation within the West Bank for ten years...).
* **The passage also mentions:** ""...PA እቲ ስምምዕ ን5 ዓመት ክከዉን ወሲኑ."" (...PA extended and maintained the agreement for 5 years.)

This implies a ten-year military occupation overall, not specifically a five-year one in the Jordan Valley. While there might have been a five-year phase *within* that ten-year period, the passage doesn't explicitly state that as a distinct event.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: ቅድሚ ውግእ ኣብ ዝነበረ ዅነታት እተመርኰሰ ዶባት (Domes considered in the state before the war):** The passage directly states the domes were considered in the pre-war situation.
* **B: ቀጻሊ ወተሃደራዊ ህላወ ኣብ ጎልጎል ዮርዳኖስ (Continuous military occupation in the Jordan Valley):** The passage mentions continuous military occupation *within the West Bank*, which includes the Jordan Valley.
* **C: ብዛዕባ መጻኢ ዕድል ኢየሩሳሌም ዝምልከት መልስታት (Answers regarding the future of Jerusalem):** The passage explicitly mentions discussions about the future of Jerusalem.

The question asks who was in fourth place during the four-race season. While Hamlin was ahead of Boyer, the text doesn't explicitly state who was in fourth. However, it does say that Hamlin was ahead of Boyer by five points. Therefore, Boyer must have been in fourth place.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ናይ ያሁ/Yahoo!ን ናይ ማይክርሶፍትን ተጠቀምቲ ቁጽሪ ተደሚሩ ንናይ AOL ዓሚላት ቁጽሪ ዝወዳደር እዩ.""  This translates to: ""The number of Yahoo! and Microsoft users is comparable to the number of AOL users.""  This directly supports option C, which states that AOL users can be compared to Yahoo! and Microsoft users.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቁጽሪ ተጠቀምቲ ኤ.ኦ.ኤል ክውስኽ ይኽእል:** (AOL users can be invested in) - The passage doesn't say anything about investing in AOL users.
*   **B: ኤ.ኦ.ኤል ዕዳጋ ኣይ.ኤም ዘማዕበለ እንኮ ትካል ክኸውን እዩ:** (AOL's debt is not a leading company) - The passage says AOL has debt and is struggling, but it doesn't say its debt is *not* leading. It implies the debt is a problem.
*   **D: ድሕሪ ደጊም ኤ.ኦ.ኤል ኣብ ኣሜሪካ ኣብ ጥቕሚ ኣይክውዕልን እዩ:** (Eventually AOL will not succeed in America) - The passage states AOL is struggling *now*, but it doesn't definitively say it will fail entirely in the future. It's more about a current problem.

Here's why:

* The passage states that AOL has been struggling to grow its advertising business and has lost its market share.
* It also mentions that AOL has the freedom to develop its own advertising.
* The question asks what new development could help AOL regain its freedom to succeed.  The freedom to develop its own advertising *at its own pace* is the key to overcoming its current struggles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሰፊሕ ምዕባለ ኢንተርነት ኣብ ኣሜሪካ** (Wider internet expansion in America) - While potentially beneficial overall, this doesn't directly address AOL's specific problem of advertising growth.
* **B: ዕዳጋ ኣይ.ኤም ምጥቃም** (Ad.com crash) - This is a past event that contributed to AOL's problems, but isn't a *new* development that would help.
* **D: ሽርክነት ያሁን ማይክሮሶፍትን** (Partnership with Yahoo!) - While a partnership could be helpful, the passage already compares AOL's user base favorably to Yahoo!'s and Microsoft's. The passage is focused on AOL needing to regain control of its advertising, not necessarily relying on partnerships.



"
ኣብቲ መጥቃዕቲ ካብ ዝሞቱ ኽንደይ ዝኣኽሉ ሰባት እዮም ኣባላት ፖሊስ ዘይኮኑ?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The question asks how many of the victims were *not* police officers. The text states: ""ናይ'ቲ ኣመሓዳሪ ቤት-ጽሕፈት ከምዝበሎ ኣሰርተ ትሽዓተ ካብ'ቶም ዝተጎድኡ ፖሊስ እዮም ነይሮም።"" which translates to ""The administrative office said that 19 of those injured were police officers.""

It also states: ""ልዕሊ ዒስራ ዝኾኑ ድማ ከቢድ መጉዳእቲ ኣብፂሑሎም እዩ"" which translates to ""Over 10 were severely injured.""

Therefore, the number of police officers killed is 2 (from the initial statement about the police cars being attacked). Since the administrative office stated that 19 of the injured were police officers, and over 10 were severely injured, the total number of injured non-police officers would be (over 10) - 19 = negative number, which is impossible.

The question asks for the number of non-police victims among those killed. The text clearly states: ""ልዕሊ ዒስራ ዝኾኑ ድማ ከቢድ መጉዳእቲ ኣብፂሑሎም እዩ"" meaning ""Over 10 were severely injured."" And "" ናይ'ቲ ኣመሓዳሪ ቤት-ጽሕፈት ከምዝበሎ ኣሰርተ ትሽዓተ ካብ'ቶም ዝተጎድኡ ፖሊስ እዮም ነይሮም።"" means ""The administrative office said that 19 of those injured were police officers.""

The question asks how many of the *killed* were *not* police officers. The passage only states that the police cars were attacked and that 2 police officers were killed in that attack. There is no information on how many non-police officers were killed.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how many of the *injured* were not police officers, and using the information that 19 police officers were injured, then we need to consider the 10+ severely injured people. The number of non-police injured would be (10+) - 19, which is a negative number. This is not possible.

Let's re-examine the passage. ""ልዕти ዒስራ ዝኾኑ ድማ ከቢድ መጉዳእቲ ኣብፂሑሎም እዩ"" means ""Over 10 were severely injured."" and ""ናይ'ቲ ኣመሓዳሪ ቤት-ጽሕፈት ከምዝበሎ ኣሰርተ ትሽዓተ ካብ'ቶም ዝተጎድኡ ፖሊስ እዮም ነይሮም።"" means ""The administrative office said that 19 of those injured were police officers.""  This means that 19 were police officers and injured. If over 10 were severely injured, then those that were not police officers would be (10+) - 19 which yields a negative number. There must be a typo.

The only answer that is logically derived is that 2 police officers were killed. The passage does not specify how many civilians were killed.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{2}$"
መን'ዩ ነቲ ኣብቲ መጥቃዕቲ ዝተጠርጠረ ሰብ ጸብጺቡ?,"The correct answer is **A: ፖሊስ (Police)**.

Therefore, the police are the ones reporting on the suspect and the claimed responsibility.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: ራኦኒክ 88% ጽሩይ ነጥቢ ኣመዝጊቡ (Raochnik scored 88% correct points):** This is mentioned as Nadal's overall percentage, not Raochnik's.
* **C: እቲ ውጽኢት 7 ብ 2 ኢዩ ነይሩ (The result was 7 to 2):** This refers to the set score, not the point score after the first serve.
* **D: ራኦኒክ ንናዳል ስዒሩዎ (Raochnik served to Nadal):** This is a general statement about the game and doesn't describe the outcome of the first point.

ኣየናይ መደብ ቋንቋ እዩ ኣብተን ሰለስተ ሓደስቲ ፈነወታት ኔክድ ኒውስ ዘይተኻተተ?,"The correct answer is **B: ኮርያኛ (Korean)**.

The text states that the new apps are available in Spanish, Italian, Japanese, and Korean. Therefore, Korean is one of the languages included.

Here's why:

The text states that Naked News is expanding its reach through new platforms, including apps for TV, streaming, and **mobile**. It also mentions that these apps are available in Spanish, Italian, and Korean *in addition to* English and Japanese. This implies the underlying technology enabling these apps is the **internet**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሞባይላት (Mobile)** - While mobile is mentioned as a platform, it's not what the new innovations *are*. The innovations are the apps themselves.
*   **C: ትያትራት (Theater)** - Theater is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: ተለቪዥን (Television)** - Television is mentioned as a platform, but the question asks what the new innovations *are*, not the platforms they target.

Therefore, the most logical answer is that the new innovations are happening *through* the **internet**."

The text states: ""45 ካብ ጠቅላላ 117 ስኪየርስ ኣብ ጃየንት ስላሎም ናብ ደረጃ ካብ ምእታው ፈሺለን"" which translates to ""45 of the total 117 skiers failed to finish in the giant slalom"". Therefore, 45 skiers did not complete the giant slalom.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the statement that best illustrates the outcome of the championships.** The passage explicitly states, ""45 ካብ ጠቅላላ 117 ስኪየርስ ኣብ ጃየንት ስላሎም ናብ ደረጃ ካብ ምእታው ፈሺለን"" (45 of the total 117 skiers failed to finish in the Giant Slalom). This is a significant outcome and directly reflects the results of the competition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብቲ ካልኣይ ውድድር፡ ካርፔናዶ ንሓደ ካብ ሃንጋሪ ዝመጸ ተቐዳዳማይ ስኪየር ቀዲሙ ዛዚሙ** (In the second race, Carpeናdo beat one Hungarian competitor) - While this is a detail of the second race, it doesn't illustrate the overall outcome of the championships as well as option B.
* **C: ካብ ስላሎም ንላዕሊ ንጃይንት ስላሎም ዝዛዘሙ ተቐዳደምቲ ስኪየር ዝበዝሑ እዮም** (More skiers who ranked higher in Slalom also ranked higher in Giant Slalom) - The passage doesn't provide information about the relationship between Slalom and Giant Slalom rankings.
* **D: ካርፔናዶ ኣብ ውድድር ስላሎም ዓስራይ ደረጃ ሒዙ ወዲኡ** (Carpeናdo finished tenth in the Slalom race) - This is a detail of Carpeናdo's performance in Slalom, but it doesn't fully illustrate the championships' outcome.

Here's why:

* The text states that the NBA postponed the tournament due to COVID-19.
* It then specifically mentions that a player from the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.
* The question asks what the NBA *banned*.  The ban is on players who test positive, not just the tournament time, a specific team, or the tournament itself.



Therefore, option C directly reflects the reason for the NBA's action as described in the text."

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""ናይ ኤን.ቢ.ኤ ውሳነ ዝሃቦ ዩታህ ጃዝ ኣጻዋቲ ን ኮቪድ-19 ቫይረስ ኣወንታዊ ምርመራ ምግባሩ ዝስዕብ እዩ"" which translates to ""The Utah Jazz NBA player underwent a positive COVID-19 test.""
* Option D accurately reflects this statement by saying ""One player of the Utah Jazz club contracted the coronavirus.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ኣባላት ኤን.ቢ.ኤ ብቫይረስ ኮሮና ተለኺፎም** (NBA players contracted the coronavirus): The passage only mentions one player from the Utah Jazz.
* **B: ኣብ ጸወታ ዩታህ ጃዝ ሓያሎ ተጻወትቲ ብቫይረስ ኮሮና ተለኺፎም** (Strong players of the Utah Jazz team contracted the coronavirus): The passage doesn't specify that it was a strong player.

Here's why:

The passage states: "" ኣብ 2010 ኣ.ፍ ብብሔራዊ ደረጃ እንስየም፣ እቲ ናይ ሎሚ ዓብዪ ናይ መንገዲ ባንኪ ኖርዘርን ሮክ ሓ/ዝተ/ው/ማ ካብቲ ሕማቅ ባንኪ ኖርዘርን ሮክ እዩ ተኸፊ%。 ቨርጅን ናይ ሰሜን ሮክ ‹ጉድ ባንክ› ጥራይ እምበር ናይ ንብረት ምምሕድዳር ኩባንያ ኣይገዝኣቶን."" which translates to: ""In 2010, at the national level, the current major road bank Northern Rock was taken over by the distressed bank Northern Rock. Virgin did not acquire North Rock as a 'good bank' but as a property management company.""

This indicates that Northern Rock was acquired by a property management company, effectively a government bailout disguised as a private acquisition. While the text mentions a government bailout, it is the *acquisition by the property management company* that is directly linked to the bank's survival and the shift in ownership. Options A and C are partially correct but not as precise as B. Option D is not mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group bid for Northern Rock *before* the bank's nationalization, but his bid was rejected.
* It then goes on to say that Northern Rock was eventually taken over by the Bank of England in 2010.
* Therefore, option D accurately reflects the sequence of events: Virgin Group made a bid, it was rejected, and then the bank was nationalized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቨርጅን ግሩፕ ንናይ ኖርዘርን ሮክ ናይ ንብረት ምሕደራ ኩባንያ’ውን ዓዲጉ:** The passage explicitly says Virgin Group did *not* take over Northern Rock's asset management company.
* **B: ቨርጅን ግሩፕ ነቲ ባንክ መንግስታዊ ድሕሪ ምዃኑ’ዩ ዓዲጉዎ:** The passage doesn't state that Virgin Group advocated for the bank's nationalization.
* **C: ቨርጅን ግሩፕ ኣብ እዋን ቅልውላው ሞርትጌጅ ነቲ ባንክ ህጹጽ ደገፍ ኣቕሪቡ ነይሩ:** The passage doesn't mention Virgin Group providing financial support to the bank during the mortgage crisis.

Therefore, the passage explicitly identifies America as the country that opposed the Kyoto climate agreement.

The passage states that Australia's government refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol *because of its strong economy*. It explicitly mentions that the government's ""வግዒ-መጥበቒመንግስቲ"" (policy-oriented government) didn't want to hinder its economy by complying with the protocol.

Therefore, the economy is the reason Australia opposed the Kyoto Protocol.

Here's why: The question asks which statement *doesn't* accurately describe the test being recognized. The passage states the test was initially not recognized because it was the first test of its kind.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ተኳሲት ናይ ልምምድ መምርሒ ተዋሂብዎም (They established consistent training guidelines):** The passage mentions they *received* training guidelines.
* **C: ሬንጀርስ ነቶም ተኮስቲ ይቆጻጸርዎም ነበሩ (Rangers maintained contact with the coaches):** The passage states the Rangers were *recognizing* the coaches.
* **D: ኣርባዕተ ተኮስቲ ተመሪጾም (Four coaches coordinated):** The passage mentions four coaches initially developed the test.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the study involves ""መከፋፈሊ ብሞለኩላር መርትዖ ከምቲዝተገመተ"" which translates to ""separation by molecular spectroscopy"". The passage then connects this to the idea of things returning to their original state. Therefore, the focus is on the analysis using molecular spectroscopy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ርኽበት ናይቲ ቅሪተ-ኣካላት (The rift valley's fertility):** While the Rift Valley might be mentioned in the broader context, the passage doesn't focus on its fertility.
* **B: እቲ ምፍልላይ (The splitting/separation):** While splitting is *part* of the molecular spectroscopy process, the question asks about the *discovery* made, and the discovery is the use of molecular spectroscopy itself.
* **D: ኣብ ሪፍት ቫሊ ዝተገብረ መጽናዕቲ (The research conducted in the Rift Valley):** The research in the Rift Valley is the *context* for the study, not the key discovery.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C**.

Here's why:

* The text states the Nintendo Wii sensor bar uses two sensors placed *near* the television. 
* If the sensors are too far, they won't be able to accurately track the player's movements. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ’ቲ ተቖጻጻሪ ሴንሰራት ኣብ ጥቓ’ቲ ኮንሶል ከም ዘለዉ ኣረጋግጽ (Ensure the console sensors are near the console):** The text specifies sensors near the *television*, not the console.
* **B: መርገጺኦም ስሉስ ኩርናዕ ግበሩ (Move them in a three-pronged pattern):** While the Wii sensors *do* move in a three-pronged pattern, this isn't the solution to tracking issues; it's how they work.
* **D: ነቲ መቖጻጻሪ ብኣየር ኣንቀሳቕሶ (Move the console in the air):** This isn't relevant to sensor tracking; the sensors are tracking *player* movement, not the console itself.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቲ ናይ ኒንቴንዶ ሪቮሉሽን መቖጻጻሪ** (The Nintendo Revolution remote) - While the remote is for the Nintendo Revolution, the question asks what it *resembles*.
* **C: እቲ ቀንዲ ኣቀራርባ** (The main controller) - The remote is not the main controller; the console itself is.
* **D: እቲ ናይ ኒንቴንዶ ሪቮሉሽን ኮንሶል** (The Nintendo Revolution console) - This is incorrect as the question asks what the remote resembles, not the console.

The text states that a plane was bombed and crashed in Afghanistan, specifically in Kandahar. Option A accurately reflects this key detail, which is the core of the news report.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እታ ነፋሪት ኣብ ኡሩምኪ እያ ዓሊባ (The plane is in Urumqi)** - While the report mentions the plane returned to Urumqi, it doesn't say it *is* in Urumqi. It just states it returned there.
* **C: እታ ነፋሪት ናብ ኣፍጋኒስታን ተሰጋጊራ (The plane is heading to Afghanistan)** -  The plane crashed *in* Afghanistan, it didn't head *to* Afghanistan.
* **D: እታ ነፋሪት ኣብ ካንዳሃር እያ ዓሊባ (The plane is in Kandahar)** - The plane crashed *in* Kandahar, it didn't *is* in Kandahar.

This implies the initial report was about the crash itself.

The other options are either details about what happened *after* the initial crash (like the attempt to fly to Afghanistan or the failure to land) or a consequence of the crash (being bombed). The question asks about the *first* report.

The text explicitly states that Sara Danius wrote a statement *because* the committee couldn't comment directly on Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize. Option D accurately reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ተዓዋቲ ሽልማት ኖቤል ስነ-ጽሑፍ** (Permanent Secretary of the Nobel Prize in Literature) - While true, this doesn't address *what she did on the radio*.
*   **B: እቲ ኮሚቴ ካብ ተሓባበርቲ ዝኾነ ይኹን መልሲ ኣይረኸበን** (The committee didn't receive a response from any collaborators) - The text says she received a *positive* response to her email.
*   **C: ሕጹያት ሽልማት ኖቤል ስነ-ጽሑፍ 2016** (The final Nobel Prize in Literature 2016) - This is too general. The question asks about what she said *during the radio broadcast*.

The phrase ""ዓቢ ፍጻመ"" (abi ftsame) which means ""great achievement"" is attributed to George W. Bush.

Therefore, the question asks who saw the achievement as ""great,"" and the text directly links that sentiment to George W. Bush.

Here's why:

The text states that the oil in the barrels is still burning inside. This indicates spontaneous combustion, which is a dangerous process where oil can ignite and burn on its own due to exposure to air.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ ካልኣይ ደረጃ መዕቆሪ ቦታ ክሳብ ዓቕሙ ይምላእ ኣሎ (The second-level storage facility will fill up to its capacity):** While the facility has capacity, the immediate concern isn't filling it up, but containing the ongoing fire and preventing further spills.

By Thursday afternoon, the oil workers probably were still dealing with the heat that caused expansion inside the barrels.)

This clearly indicates that the expansion of the oil due to heat caused the tank's opening to fail.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ድሕሪ ናይ ስርዓት ፈተነ ምቁራጽ ሓይሊ ኣጋጢሙ** (The pressure increased after the system test was completed) - The passage doesn't mention the system test.
*   **C: እተን ታንክታት ኣብ ምሉእ ዓቕመን ነይረን** (Those tanks were full) - The passage says the tanks weren't full, they had an opening problem.
*   **D: እቲ ካልኣይ ደረጃ መዕቆሪ ቦታ እኹል በርሚል ክሕዝ ኣይከኣለን** (The second-level storage area couldn't store a reasonable number of barrels) - This option is not relevant to the main reason the oil was released from the first tank."
ኣብዚ ሕዚ እዋን እቲ ኣብ ታሽዓይ ዋርድ ዘሎ ማይ ክንደይ ዝኣክል ብራኸ ኣለዎ?,"The correct answer is **A: 20 ጫማ**.

The text states: ""ናይንዝ ዋርድ ኣብ እዋን ህቦብላ ካትሪና ክሳብ 20 ጫማ ዝበፅሕ ማዕበል ዝሃረማ..."" which translates to ""Ninety Ward flooded to a height of 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina...""  The question asks how much the water has risen *now* in Ninezie Ward. The text then states that the current flood is overflowing, and water has risen 100 feet from the riverbank. However, the initial flood during Katrina reached 20 feet. Since the question asks about the current height, and the 20 feet is mentioned in relation to Katrina, and the text highlights the current overflow, we can infer that the current height is at least 20 feet, and likely higher than the 100 feet mentioned as the rise from the riverbank.

However, among the provided options, only 20 feet is directly mentioned in the text as the height reached during Hurricane Katrina, and serves as a reference point. The text does not explicitly state the current height in feet, only that it's overflowing and the water rose 100 feet from the riverbank. Therefore, the closest answer from the options is 20 feet, as it refers to the height during the previous, known flood.



**It's important to note that the question is somewhat ambiguous, as the text doesn't directly state the current height of the water in feet.** If there were an option stating ""overflowing"" or ""more than 20 feet,"" that would be a more accurate answer.

The passage states: ""ናይንዝ ዋርድ ኣብ እዋን ህቦብላ ካትሪና ክሳብ 20 ጫማ ዝበፅሕ ማዕበል ዝሃረማ"" which translates to ""Nine Ward was flooded up to 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina.""

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states that Hamilton confirmed the patient was admitted in good condition.** He also mentioned the hospital was following protocols to prevent transmission.
*   **The passage does NOT say whether the patient was isolated.** It only states that protocols were in place to *prevent* transmission, implying isolation might be part of those protocols, but it doesn't confirm it.
*   **Options B, C, and D** are all directly supported by Hamilton's statements:
    *   **B: ካልእ ሕሙም በቲ ቫይረስ ናይ ምልካፍ ተኽእሎ (Other patients with the potential to contract the virus):**  The passage mentions the protocols were in place to protect *other* patients.
    *   **C: ግቡእ ፕሮቶኮል ተኸቲሉ ድዩ ኣይተኸተለን (Appropriate protocols were followed):** Hamilton states the hospital was operating according to protocols.
    *   **D: ህሉው ኩነታት ናይ’ቲ ሕሙም (The patient's condition):**  Hamilton confirmed the patient was admitted in good condition.

Therefore, the only statement Hamilton *didn't* confirm is whether the patient was isolated.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ተመራመርቲ ዓለማት ብከመይ ከምዝፍጠራ ብፍላይ ድማ ቕድሚ ብዙሕ ዓመታት ኮሜትስ ምስ ምድሪ ምስተጋጨወት ምድሪ ብከመይ ከምዝተፈጠረት ከምዝርድኡ ትፅቢት ይገብሩ。"" (Researchers are particularly studying how planets were formed, especially how the Earth was formed after comets collided with it many years ago.)

The passage focuses on the connection between cometary impacts and the formation of Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ኮሜትታት ምስ ምድሪ ኺጋጨዉ ከለዉ (That comets collided with the Earth):** While true, this is a *part* of the larger question, not the core focus.
* **B: ፕሮቲናት ብኸመይ ከም ዝፍጠሩ (How proteins are formed):**  The passage mentions organic matter, but it doesn't delve into the specifics of protein formation.  It's a tangential point.
* **C: ኦርጋኒክ ነገር እንታይ ምዃኑ (The fact that organic matter is found):** This is also true, but again, not the central research question.  The significance is *why* organic matter is found, linked to the Earth's formation.

Here's why:

The passage states that the police action involved 80 officers stopping motorcyclists on a route that typically experienced heavy traffic congestion. The action was taken despite no apparent reason for causing such a disruption. This implies the police were actively interfering with the traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኤፍ.ቢ.ኣይ ነቲ ምዕጻው ንክገብሮ ኣተሓሳሲቦም (The FBI did not consider interfering with the process):** This is irrelevant to the question about the police's actions.
*   **B: ነቲ ምዕጻው ክገብርዎ ወሲኖም (They wanted to carry out the process):**  While the police were carrying out a process (stopping motorcyclists), the question asks *how* they acted during the process. The passage implies their actions were excessive and disruptive.
*   **C: ንመራሕቲ መካይን ናብ ካልእ መስመራት ንክኸዱ ገይሮም (They directed the procession to other routes):** The passage doesn't mention directing a procession. It focuses on stopping individual motorcyclists.

The passage states that the Metro tunnels were ""productive"" during the construction and after. The context implies they were functional and served their purpose.

The other options don't fit the context:

*   B: ከም መዘናግዒ ዀይኖም የገልግሉ ነይሮም (They functioned as a deterrent) - The passage doesn't mention them as a deterrent.
*   C: ንመራሕቲ መካይን ክፉታት ነይረን (They were harmful to the construction leaders) -  No mention of harm.
*   D: ብርቱዕ ናይ ተሽከርከርቲ ፍሰት ነይሩ (They were intense/heavy traffic) - The passage specifically mentions the *lack* of heavy traffic as a problem, not that the tunnels *were* heavy traffic.

Option A is incorrect because the text says he was ordered to pull over by a highway patrol. Option C is incorrect because the text says he *didn't* have a photo to show the police. Option D is incorrect because the text says the police *repeatedly* tried to get him to pull over.

The text explicitly states: ""ካብ ናይ ጎሮሮ ሕማምን ሙቐትን ወጻኢ ኣብ ጽቡቕ ስሚዒት እየ ዘለኹ"" which translates to ""Outside of throat pain and fever, I am in good condition.""  Therefore, the president *does* mention being in good condition *except* for the throat pain and fever.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጎሮሮኡ ቃንዛ ኣለዎ (He has a sore throat):** The text says he has throat pain (""ናይ ጎሮሮ ሕማן"").
* **C: ኣብ ዝተረጋገአ ኩነታት’ዩ ዘሎ (He is in a confirmed situation):**  The text doesn't indicate that his situation is confirmed. It only states he tested positive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ረስኒ የብሉን (He is not going to recover):** The text says he's in ""ጽቡቕ ስሚዒት"" (good spirits), which suggests recovery is possible.
* **B: ንሓያሎ ሰሙናት ኣብ ገዝኡ ክጸንሕ'ዩ (He is going to stay in the country for a long time):** The text indicates he's *unable* to stay in the country, not that he *will* stay for a long time.
* **C: ንሱ ኣብ ገዝኡ ኮይኑ ክሰርሕ ጽቡቕ እዩ (It is good for him to work while in the country):** The text implies it's *not* good for him to be in the country due to his illness.

Here's why:

The passage states that the tropical cyclone Gunu had winds of 240 km/h. The question asks when the danger of the cyclone continuing to intensify lessened. The passage then mentions that the winds *dropped* to around 83 km/h, indicating a decrease in intensity and thus a lessening of the immediate danger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቅድሚ ናብ ማልዲቭስ ምብጽሑ (Before approaching the Maldives):** While the intensity before reaching the Maldives is relevant, the passage focuses on the change in wind speed *after* it reached the Maldives.
* **C: ኣብ ዝለዓለ ጥርዙ ቅድሚ ምብጽሑ (During the intensifying phase before approaching):** The passage doesn't provide information about the cyclone intensifying.
* **D: ቅድሚ ኣብ ሰዓት 149 ማይልስ ዝዓቐኑ ንፋስ ምብጽሑ (Before the winds reached 149 mph):** This is just a restatement of the initial wind speed and doesn't address when the danger lessened.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ዘየቋርፅንፋስ ን240ኪሜ ኣብ ሰዓት (149 ማይልስ ኣብ ሰዓት) በፂሑ።"" This translates to ""The sustained winds reached 240 km/h (149 mph).""  The question asks about the wind speed in km/h.  Therefore, 149 km/h is the correct answer.

Here's why:

* The passage states that *Karenia brevis* produces neurotoxins that are harmful to fish.  While the passage mentions the toxin can be harmful to humans if they inhale contaminated water, it *doesn't* explicitly state that it directly affects human nerves.
* The passage *does* mention that it's a red tide algae (type of algae - A), it's highly toxic (many toxins - C), and it's naturally occurring (D).  The lack of specific mention of nerve effects makes option B the correct answer.



Therefore, the answer is **B**."

Here's why:

The passage describes Karenia brevis as a naturally occurring, microscopic, red tide algae. It states that the algae produces neurotoxins. The effects described are:

*   **Fish die from poisoning:** This is a consequence of the neurotoxins in the water.
*   **People who breathe the water can get sick:** This is due to the neurotoxins being aerosolized.
*   **The algae thrives in nutrient-rich water:** This explains why red tides occur.

The passage *doesn't* mention anything about the algae forming nerves in fish. The other options are directly related to the algae's toxins and effects:

*   **B: ኣብ ትሕቲ ዝኾነ ኩነታት ብቑጽሪ ብቕልጡፍ ምወሳኽ (Rapidly sinking under certain conditions):** The passage explains that nutrient conditions promote algae growth.
*   **C: ነቲ ማይ ይጸልዎ (Pollutes the water):** The passage describes Karenia brevis as a red tide, a form of water pollution.
*   **D: ኒውሮቶክሲን ምፍራይ (Production of neurotoxins):** This is a central point of the passage.



Therefore, the option that is *not* mentioned as a characteristic or effect of Karenia brevis is the formation of nerves in fish.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite the hurricane, the islands remained largely intact (""ዛጊድ ዘጋጠመ ጉድኣት ወይ ውሑጅ ኣይተጸብጸበን"" - No significant damage or deficiencies were suffered).  Therefore, significant deficiencies were *not* a problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ረብሓ ዘለዎ ዝናብ (Rebha Zelewo Zunab - Heavy Rainfall):** The passage mentions that some of the rains were heavy (""ካብ'ቲ ዝናብ ብነጎዳን በርቒን ተሰንዩ ነይሩ"" - Some of the rains were associated with wind and rain).
*   **B: ብነጎዳ ዝተሰነየ ዝናብ (Bnegoda Zatesenyu Zunab - Rain associated with wind):** The passage explicitly mentions rain associated with wind (""ካብ'ቲ ዝናብ ብነጎዳን በርቒን ተሰንዩ ነይሩ"").
*   **C: ተደጋጋሚ በርቂ (Tedagagmi Berqi - Repeated Lightning):** The passage doesn't explicitly state that there was repeated lightning, but the mention of wind and rain suggests the possibility of lightning.

Therefore, the only option that is definitively *not* stated as a problem is significant deficiencies.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Piquet Jr. was fired by Renault after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.  The question asks about the outcome of the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix in terms of a *consequence*.  Piquet Jr.'s firing is a direct consequence mentioned in the passage related to that race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ፈርናንዶ ኣሎንሶ ሓደጋ ኣጋጢምዎ (Fernando Alonso caused the accident):** While Alonso caused the crash, the passage focuses on Piquet Jr.'s subsequent firing, not the accident itself.
* **B: ፒኬት ጁንየር ዓወት ኣመዝጊቡ (Piquet Jr. won the race):**  Piquet Jr. did *not* win the race. He crashed.
* **D: እታ ናይ ድሕነት መኪና ሓደጋ ኣጋጢምዋ (That safety car caused the accident):** The safety car was deployed *because* of the crash, but the passage doesn't state the safety car *caused* the crash. It's a consequence of the crash.

This clearly indicates the collision happened **immediately after** Pike Junior overtook Alonso.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the **evolutionary process** of the new species – how it arose in just two generations, challenging the long timescales previously thought necessary. It also mentions the species' name (C) and the researchers involved (D). 

The location (A) is a given; the study *took place* in the Galapagos Islands. It's not the subject of the researchers' *discovery* or the focus of their research question. They were investigating the *speed* of evolution and the *specific characteristics* of the new species.

Therefore, the researchers aren't primarily investigating *where* the species evolved, but *how* and *what* it is.

* **A: ኣብተን “ፈጠራዊት” ተባሂለን ዝሕሰባ ከተማታት ጥራይ እዩ ዝፍጸም (It is only held in cities called ""creative"").** The passage doesn't mention any specific naming criteria for the cities where Coparade is held.
* **B: ብምምሕዳር ከተማ ቡካሬስት ዝተዳለወ እዩ (It is coordinated by the city of Bucharest).** The passage says Coparade takes place *in* the Bucharest City Hall, but it doesn't say Bucharest *coordinates* it.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Il-76 was a ""Soviet military component"" of both Russia and the Soviet Union from 1970 onwards. 
* The question asks what ""II-76s"" are referred to as by Russia.
* The text then mentions a significant accident involving an Il-76, and Russia's subsequent efforts to secure them. This implies the Il-76s are a key part of their military.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ናይ ውሽጢ ሃገር ሰራዊት (Internal national army):** While technically correct, ""Soviet military force"" is more specific and accurate based on the context.
* **B: ሓደጋ (Accident):** This describes what happened *to* an Il-76, not what the Il-76 *is*.

II-76 እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ውትሃደራዊ ነፋሪት (Military Transport Aircraft)**.

The text explicitly states that the II-76 was a ""ውትሃደራዊ ክልቲአን ሩስያን ሶቪየትን ወተሃደራዊ ክፋል ኮይኑ"" which translates to ""a military aircraft of both Russia and the Soviet Union"". It also refers to it as a ""ነፋሪት"" (aircraft) and mentions a specific incident involving its engine failing."
መን እዩ ነታ ናይ ዘ ሲምፕሰንስ ናይ ጽሑፍ ጉጅለ ቆጺርዋ?,"The correct answer is **D: ግሮኒንግ (Groening)**.

The passage states: ""ብ1989 ሲምፕሶን ምስ ብሩክስን ግሮይንግን ንምፍጣር ዝሓገዘ ክኸውን ከሎ..."" which translates to ""In 1989, Simpson, together with Brooks and Groening, sought to create..."".  This indicates that Matt Groening was part of the writing team. While Brooks was involved, the question asks *who* the writing team was *led by*, and Groening is the key figure associated with the creation of The Simpsons.

The text states that ""ናይ ጥንሲ ምከላኸሊ መድሓኒት ከም ናይ ሕክምና ኣገዳስነት ንክትቆጽሮ ብኣዋልድ ኾነ ብኣወዳት ብዙሕ ኣወንታዊ ርኢቶታት ከምኡውን መበረታትዒታት ተላኢኾምላ በዚ ምክንያት ናብዚ ውሳነ በጺሓ"" which translates to ""The contraceptive medicine, as a medical necessity, was being considered for women by evaluating many positive aspects and benefits, and as a result, it came to this union.""

This implies that the positive views and benefits were being advocated by organizations *representing both men and women*. Therefore, option D is the most accurate.

The passage states that the article was submitted because there was no one to talk about the care of women, and that this area of preventative medicine is important for women's health.  Therefore, the passage implies that many people don't discuss the care of women."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ኣየናይ ፕላኔት እዩ እቲ ብርቱዕ ምንቅስቓስ ዘርኢ?,"The correct answer is **B: ታይታን (Titan)**.

As we know, there is only one planet that has more active movement than Titan, and that is Earth.""

Therefore, the planet with the most active movement mentioned in the text is Titan.

The text explicitly states: ""ስለዚ ኣብ ገምገም ባሕሪ ደው እንተኢልካ፣ ዝደለካዮ ኣብ ናይቲ ባሕሪ ታሕቲ ዘሎ እምኒ ወይ ሓሸዋ ክትርኢ ትኽእል ኢኻ። ከም እንፈልጦ ካብ ታይታን ንላዕली ብርቱዕ ምንቅስቓስ ዘርኢ ሓንቲ ፕላኔት ጥራሕ እያ ዘላ ፣ ሽማ ክዓ ምድሪ እዩ"" which translates to ""So, if you look at the surface of the sea, you can see the land or the shores that you desire beneath the sea. As we know, Titan is the only planet besides Saturn that shows vigorous movement.""

Therefore, the text identifies Titan as the planet with liquid seas and vigorous activity.

ካብዚ ርኽበታት እዚ ውጽኢት ናይቲ ናይ ክንቲት ምርካብ ዘይኰነ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: እቶም ክንቲት ኣብ በረራ ከምዘይጥቀሙሉ ምርዳእ (The fact that the ribs did not fully articulate during flight)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that the discovery of the rib structure is unusual because it points to a different function than typical dinosaur ribs.  Specifically, the ribs are described as being more similar to the rib coverings of large flying creatures rather than the short, blunt ribs found in many dinosaurs.

Option B directly addresses this unusual feature. The passage implies that the ribs' structure and how they functioned during flight (or potentially a gliding-like movement) is what makes this discovery significant and deviates from the typical understanding of dinosaur ribs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ሕብሪ ላሕሚ ናይ’ቲ እንስሳ (The animal's metabolism):**  While metabolism is important, the passage doesn't link the rib structure directly to the animal's metabolism.
* **C: ብዛዕባ ፍልቀት ክንቲት ርድኢት (Observations about rib flight):** While the passage discusses flight, it's the *lack of full articulation* of the ribs during flight that's crucial, not just general observations about rib flight. Option B encompasses this nuance.
* **D: መብዛሕትኦም ዳይኖሰር ክንቲት ከም ዝነበሮም መረጋገጺ (Confirmation that"
እቶም ናይ ዳይኖሰር ክንቲት ዘይነበሮም ነገር እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ፍሕሽው ሕብሪ ዘለዎ ትሕተ-ቅርጺ (Intricate internal structure)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that while dinosaur ribs had a supportive pillar (rachis), they also had other elements called **barbs and barbulus**. The discovery of an **intricate internal structure** (characterized by these barbs and barbulus) that wasn't connected to the rachis is what researchers found to be a significant change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ባርቡልስ (Barbulus)** - Barbulus is *part* of the intricate structure, not the thing that was missing.
*   **B: ራቺስ (Rachis)** - The rachis *was* present in dinosaur ribs, according to the text.
*   **C: ናይ ዓቢ ተሪር ክንቲታዊ ሽፋን (Large rib covering)** - While the rib *was* a large covering, the key finding wasn't the presence of a large covering but the *complex internal structure* within.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Zmapp (which is related to Zidmap) showed a *reduction* in mortality compared to expectations. Option B claims it *didn't* have death prevention capabilities, which contradicts the information provided. The passage highlights its benefit in lowering mortality rates.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: ካብ ኣንቲ ቦዲ ዝስራሕ እዩ** (It works as an antibody): The passage states "" ኣብ መጀመርታ ኣብቲ ዘፈር ተስፋ ሂቡ ኔሩ፤ ዳሓር ግን ስሩዕ መጽናዕቲ ከም ዝሓበሮ…"" which implies it's an antibody-like treatment.
*   **C: ኣብ ፈተነ ፓልም ከም መቆጻጸሪ ኮይኑ ኣገልጊሉ** (It acted as a comparator in the Palm study): The passage directly says ""Zidmap ከም መተሃ生科学 ከም መበገሲ ብምጥቃም ነቶም ሰለስተ ካልኦት ዓይነታት ሕክምና ምስኡ ኣወዳዲሮሞም ማለት እዩ"" (Zidmap was used as a benchmark by comparing it with three other types of treatment).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ሓደ ዜድማፕ ዝተብሃለ ኣንቲባዲ ንጥረነገር፣ ኣብ መጀመርታ ኣብቲ ዘፈር ተስፋ ሂቡ ኔሩ፤ ዳሓር ግን ስሩዕ መጽናዕቲ ከም ዝሓበሮ، ኣብ ምክልኻል ሞት ካብቲ ዝተሓሰቦ ንታሕቲ ትሑት ዝኾነ ረብሓ ከምዘለዎ ኣመላኺቱ."" (An antibody called Zmapp was initially hopeful but a recent study showed it only provided a modest reduction in mortality.)
* **The passage further describes the PALM study:** "" ኣብ'ቲ PALM መጽናዕታዊ ፈተነ، Zmapp ከም መተሓላለዊ ኣገልጊሉ፣ እዚ ማለት ድማ ክኢላ ሳይንስ ከም መበገሲ ብምጥቃም ነቶም ሰለስተ ካልኦት ዓይነታት ሕክምና ምስኡ ኣወዳዲሮሞም ማለት እዩ."" (In the PALM study, Zmapp was used as a control, meaning it was compared to three other types of treatment.)
* **Option B directly reflects this comparison.** It highlights that Zmapp was used as a control alongside three other treatments.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ሓደ ቁጽጽር ዝግበረሉ መድሃኒት ምስ ካልኦት ሰለስተ ሕክምናታት ተነጻጺሩ፡ ሓደ ካብኣቶም ዜድማፕ ዝበሃል እዩ:** While technically correct, option B is more encompassing because it refers to the *comparison* aspect of the study, not just the fact that Zmapp was one of the treatments.
* **C: ዜድማፕ ከም መበገሲ ናይ’ቲ ፈተነ ኣብ ጥቅም ውዒሉ:** The passage states Zmapp was the *control*, not the active treatment being tested.

The text states: ""ብሓደ ሳንቲም ኣሜሪካ ብስታንዳርድ ኢንክጀት ፕሪንተር ክምረት ዝኽእል ደቒቕ ቕራፍ"" which translates to ""Can be precisely fabricated with a standard inkjet printer for the cost of one American cent."" Therefore, the cost per unit is one American cent.

Here's why:

The passage states that the lunar scarps (scientists think they look like lunar craters) were formed relatively recently. It also mentions that these scarps are found all over the Moon and seem to have a recent geological origin.

Option D directly contradicts the passage, which indicates that the scarps *are* found all over the Moon. The passage doesn't suggest that most of them aren't.  The other options are all supported by the text.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the discovery of these landform-like structures, along with their variety, suggests they are the result of **recent geological processes**. 
* Option D directly reflects this conclusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ወርሒ ቀስ እንዳበለትት እንዳቀነሰት እያ (The moon is slowly deteriorating):** While the passage mentions the moon is deteriorating, it doesn't connect this deterioration directly to the *creation* of the landforms. It's a consequence of the process, not the process itself.
* **B: እቶም ቅርጽታት መሬት ቅድሚ ነዊሕ እዋን ዝተፈጥሩ እዮም (The landforms were created a long time ago):** This is the opposite of what the passage implies. The passage argues for *recent* formation.
* **C: ኣብ ገጽ ወርሒ ካብ ዝርከቡ ቅርጺ መሬት ውሑዳት ጥራይ እዮም (The landforms found on the moon's surface are isolated):** The passage specifically mentions the *variety* of the landforms, directly contradicting this option.

Here's why:

The passage states that Pitman said the thin blanket had been bothering Cilliers for the past 15 years.  It also says the blanket was of ""remarkable quality"" and had ""a torn edge.""  Therefore, the problem wasn't the *size* of the blanket, but rather its *thinness*.  The quality and the torn edge are mentioned as characteristics of the blanket, but the core issue causing the problem was its lack of thickness.



"
ብዘይካ እቲ በረድ፡ ካልእ ንጻዕርታት ምድሓን ህይወት ዝጸልዎ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሕጽረት ናይ ቀረብ (Lack of proximity)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Pitman believes the short-sighted reed, due to the lack of proximity (or closeness) of the old and the strong, has been hindering Cillers for the past 15 years.  The question asks what *else* the reed's absence would affect.  The passage implies that the reed's hindrance is related to a lack of closeness/proximity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኩነታት ኣየር (Weather conditions):** The passage mentions weather, but it's presented as a contributing factor to the reed's current state, not the primary reason for Cillers' lack of progress.
* **C: ሓገዝ ዘይምህላው (Lack of assistance):** The passage doesn't mention assistance.
* **D: ሲለርስ (Cillers):** Cillers is the entity being hindered, not something that would be affected *by the absence* of the reed in the same way that the reed's lack of proximity impacts Cillers.

Therefore, the most logical answer is a lack of proximity, as that is the core argument presented in the passage."

Here's why:

The passage states that Justice Roberts' statement about the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision being ""the law of the land"" and affirming the legitimacy of the procedural aspect of the ruling directly relates to the interpretation of Supreme Court precedents.  He is emphasizing the importance of upholding established legal principles, even when disagreeing with the outcome.  The passage focuses on the *legal* significance of his words, not a personal belief or a specific topic like life itself or contracts.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስነ-ምግባራዊነት ኣብ ጉዳያት ምዝታይ (Moral interpretation in matters of interpretation):** While ethics are relevant, the passage isn't primarily about moral interpretation. It's about the interpretation of a legal precedent.
*   **C: ናይ ህይወት መጀመርታ (The beginning of life):** The passage does not mention the beginning of life.
*   **D: ናይ ውልቃውነት መሰል (Principle of contract):** The passage doesn't relate to contract law.

Here's why:

The passage states that Roberts' comments regarding the potential issues arising from the overturning of Roe v. Wade were considered ethically problematic because he suggested that disagreeing with the previous ruling was not unethical, while simultaneously acknowledging the legitimacy of a long-standing judicial precedent.  This directly relates to the established right to privacy, which was central to the Roe v. Wade decision.  Roberts' statements touched upon the right to privacy and how it was being re-evaluated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ንጽንዓት ውሳነታት ላዕለዋይ ቤት ፍርዲ (The integrity of higher court decisions):** While related to judicial precedent, the core ethical issue isn't about the integrity of court decisions themselves, but about Roberts' comments on *disagreement* with a prior decision.
*   **B: ውሳነ ሮይ ኣንጻር ዌድ (The Roe v. Wade ruling):**  The passage doesn't say Roberts was disagreeing with the Roe v. Wade ruling *itself*, but rather with the *overturning* of it.
*   **D: ዝርዝር ጕዳያት (Specific issues):** The passage is not about any particular issue. The issue is the ethics of Roberts' statement.

The text states: "" ኣብ'ቲ ከባቢ ሓሙሽተ ሓደሽቲ ሰማይ ጠቀስ ናይ ምህናጽ ከይዲ ይቕጽል ኣሎ..."" which translates to ""In the area, the construction of new skyscrapers continues..."" The phrase "" ኣብ ፍርቂ መዓልቲ"" (At the end of the day) is the most logical place to put a continuing construction project. The other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሰዓት 8፡46 ቅ.ቀ. (8:46 AM)** - This is a specific time mentioned in the text regarding an event, not the completion time of construction.
* **C: ኣብ ለይቲ (At night)** - This refers to when the lights were seen in the sky, not the completion time of construction.
* **D: እቲ ህንጸት ቀፃሊ እዩ (The construction is finished)** - The text says the construction *continues*, so this is incorrect.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""Seven Sisters"" (the meteor craters) appear to move from light to light like a shifting pattern. This directly relates to a changing pattern or ""ምቅይያር ሙቐት"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ሰንጣቒቱ ናይቲ በዓቲ መእተዊታት (The location of the meteor craters):** While the passage mentions the craters' location, it doesn't focus on pinpointing them.
* **C: መጽናዕትታት ስነ-መሬት (Earth science articles):** The passage is *about* earth science, but it doesn't specifically highlight articles.
* **D: ስእሊ በዓትታት ኣብ ምድሪ (Pictures of meteor craters on the ground):** The passage mentions pictures, but it's the *shifting pattern* that's the key characteristic.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""seven sister"" hoodoos (the name for these formations) appear to be ""not solid rock formations, but rather deep pits in the ground.""  The description of their appearance changing from light to dark as the sun moves and disappearing in the dark further supports this idea of deep, hidden structures.

He was found under the bed after the explosion had damaged him.""

This means he *was* injured. Options A, B, and C are all directly supported by the text. Option D contradicts the text.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ሰበ - ስልጣን ኣባል ዓሌት ኡጉር ምዃኑ ይፈልጡ እኳ እንተኾነ ስሙ ግና ክሳብ ሐዚ ኣይፈልጥዎን እዮም"" which translates to ""Although they know he is a member of the Uğur clan, they still do not know his name.""  This implies the authorities have confirmed the identity of an associate, but not the suspect's name itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ዓሌት ናይቲ ዝተጠርጠር ሰብ (Clan of the suspect):** While mentioned, the passage doesn't say the authorities *confirmed* the clan. They *know* he is a member.
*   **C: እቲ ድሕሪ እቲ መጥቃዕቲ ዝነበረ ድርኺት (The aftermath of the explosion):**  The passage mentions him being found under debris, but doesn't say they confirmed anything about the aftermath.
*   **D: ናይቲ ዝተጠርጠር ሰብ ናይ መጀመርታን ናይ መወዳእታን ስም (Suspect's first and last name):** The passage explicitly states they *don't* know his name.

Therefore, the only piece of information the authorities have *confirmed* is the identity of an associate of the suspect.

The text states: "" ኣብ እዋን ተልእኾ ናይ'ቲ መደበር ጠፈር ዋላ'ኳ ሓደ ጋይሮስኮፕ እንተጠፍአ፣ ክሳብ ናይ መወዳእታ ጠፈር ዑደት እቲ መደበር ሞራሉ ሓልዩ ጸንሐ። ቺኣኦን ሻሪፖቭን ካብቶም ደፋእቲ ምትዕርራይ ጠባይ ውሑስ ርሕቀት ብምዃን ጸብጻብ ኣመሓላለፉ。""  This translates to: ""During the docking, even if one gyroscope failed, the manual of the maneuvering system remained intact until the end of the orbital period. Chizhov attributed the accident to the pilot's excessive proximity.""

The key phrase is ""ውሑስ ርሕቀት ብምዃን ጸብጻብ ኣመሓላለፉ"" which means ""attributed the accident to excessive proximity"" or ""due to maintaining insufficient distance.""  The text implies the pilot got too close, leading to the issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጋይሮስኮፕ ምሓዝ (Gyroscope malfunction):** While a gyroscope *did* fail, the text isn't saying the *malfunction itself* caused the problem.  It's the pilot's actions in response to the situation.
* **C: ጀት ምልዓል (Spacecraft re-entry):**  The text mentions the spacecraft was brought back to the station by re-entry, but this is a consequence of the situation, not the *cause* of the issue during docking.
* **D: ንቡር ኣተሓሳስባ ዳግማይ ምርካብ (Re-calculation of orbital trajectory):**  The text doesn't mention a re-calculation of the trajectory.



"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ዕላማ ተልእኾ መደበር ጠፈር እንታይ እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ዝጠፍአ ጋይሮስኮፕ ምርካብ (Lost gyroscope)**.

The passage states: "" ኣብ እዋን ተልእኾ ናይ'ቲ መደበር ጠፈር ዋላ'ኳ ሓደ ጋይሮስኮፕ እንተጠፍአ..."" which translates to ""Even when on a scheduled space mission, if a gyroscope was lost...""  The entire passage focuses on the lost gyroscope and the efforts to recover the satellite.
"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ብዛዕባ እቲ ጉዳይ ዝተዋህበ መግለጺታት ኣየናይ እዩ ሓቂ ዘይኮነ?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣብታ ዋና ቤት ጽሕፈቱ AOL ኣብ ዘለዎ ግዝኣት እዩ ተኸሲሱ (AOL filed for bankruptcy)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the legal issue occurred in Virginia because of the *type* of service provided (Wahabi internet services) and the company involved (AOL).** It doesn't mention AOL filing for bankruptcy. 
* **Options B, C, and D are all plausible and potentially true based on the context.** The passage mentions a law related to spam email, a court ruling, and AOL's involvement, all of which are consistent with the information provided.

Therefore, the statement that AOL filed for bankruptcy is the one *not* supported by the text.



"
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ኣየናይ እዩ ነቲ ጉዳይ ብልክዕ ዝገልጾ?,"The correct answer is **B: እቲ ጉዳይ ክልተ ፍሉጣት ወሃብቲ ኣገልግሎት ኢንተርነት ዝምልከት እዩ (The case concerns two prominent internet service providers).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""P: እዚ ሕጋዊ ጉዳይ ኣብ ቪርጂንያ እዩ ተፈሪዱ፣ ስለምንታይ መሰረት ናይ'ቲ ወሃቢ ኣገልግሎታት ኢንተርነት ዝኾነ፣ ከምኡ'ውን ነቲ ክሲ ዘቕረበ ኩባንያ AOL ስለዝኾነ."" (This legal matter took place in Virginia, based on the fact that it concerned the internet service providers EarthLink and AOL, and the company that filed the lawsuit, AOL.)

The passage emphasizes that the dispute involves both EarthLink and AOL as internet service providers. Options A, C, and D are partially true, but option B best encapsulates the core of the issue as described in the text.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ እቲ፡ ቪዳል ቅድሚ ሰለስተ ዓመታት ኣብ ኣየነይቲ ክለብ ክጻወት ጀሚሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሲቪያ (Sevilla)**.

The text states: ""ቪዳል ቅድሚ ሰለስተ ዓመታት ካብ ሲቪላ ናብ ባርሳ ተቐላቒሉ።"" which translates to ""Vidal moved from Sevilla to Barcelona three years ago.""
"
ቪዳል ምስ ባርሳ ክንደይ ጸወታታት ተጻዊቱ?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""ቪዳል ናብ ርእሰ ከተማ ናይ ካታሎንያ ካብ ምኻዱ እዋን ጀሚሩ፣ ነታ ጋንታ 49 ጸወታታት ተጻዊቱላ ነይሩ"" which translates to ""Since he moved to the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona, Vidal has played 49 games for the team.""
"
ኣብቲ ፀወታ ተፃባኢ ጋንታ መን እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ጃርኪ**.

The text states: ""ሰንበት ምስ ቦሎኛ ንዘለዎ ግጥም ምስ ክለቡ አብቲ ሁቴል እዩ ፀኒሑ። ሰንበት ምን ቦሎኛ ንዝግበር ጸወታ ኣብ ሆቴል እታ ጋንታ እዩ ዝጸንሕ ኔሩ。"" This translates to: ""On Sunday, he met with Bologna at the hotel regarding their match with his club. On Sunday before the match, Bologna was staying at the hotel.""  The question asks who the *player* was in the match. The text directly states that **Jaraki** was the player in the match.
"
ጃርክ ስለምንታይ ኣብቲ ሆቴል ይሓድር ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ልምምድ ነይርዎ (He was training)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""ጃርክ ኣብዚ እዋን ንጉሆ ኣብ እዋን ቕድመ ምድላው ስልጠና ኣብ ጣልያን ኮቨርሲያን ይለማመድ ኔሩ。"" which translates to ""Jarque was in Italy, training in Coverciano, at the time of the national team's pre-season.""
* The text then mentions: ""ሰንበት ምስ ቦሎኛ ንዘለዎ ግጥም ምስ ክለቡ አብቲ ሁቴል እዩ ፀኒሑ。"" which translates to ""On Saturday, he met with his club at the hotel for a match against Bologna.""
* Finally: ""ሰንበት ምን ቦሎኛ ንዝግበር ጸወታ ኣብ ሆቴል እታ ጋንታ እዩ ዝጸንሕ ኔሩ。"" which translates to ""On Saturday, Bologna was preparing for the match at the hotel.""

Putting it all together, Jarque was in Italy for pre-season training, and the meeting with his club was related to a game against Bologna. Therefore, he was at the hotel for training.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ናይ ቅድሚ ዓመተ ስፖርት ኣኼባ ነይርዎ (It was a pre-season sports meeting):** While it's *related* to pre-season, the text explicitly states he was *training*.
* **C: ኣብ ሰንበት ጸወታ ነይርዎ (He was in a game on Saturday):** The text says he *met* with his club for a game, but it doesn't say he was *playing* in a game on Saturday.
* **D: ምስ ቦሎንያ ልምምድ ይገብር ነይሩ (He was training with Bologna):**  The text says he met with his club (Bologna), not that he was specifically training *with* Bologna.



"
ስለምንታይ እዩ ኤጀንሲ ጂኦፊዚክስ ጃካርታ መጠንቀቕታ ክህብ ዘይከኣለ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሱናሚ ከም ዝመጽእ ዘስግእ ነገር ኣይነበረን (There was no threat of a tsunami).**

Here's why:

The passage states that while the earthquake had a magnitude of 6.5, it wasn't considered significant enough to warrant a tsunami warning.  The agency (Agency Geophysics Jakarta) didn't issue a warning *because* there was no indication of a tsunami.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ መንጎ ነበርቲ ስንባደ ንኸይፍጠር (To avoid panic among the residents):**  While managing panic is a consideration in emergency situations, the primary reason for *not* issuing a warning was the lack of a tsunami threat, not to avoid panic.
* **C: ኣብ ውሽጢ ዓዲ ኣብ ዝርከባ ትካላት ንግዲ ጽልዋ ንኸይህሉ (To prevent landslides within the city):** Landslides are a possible concern after an earthquake, but the passage doesn't mention them as the reason for *no* warning. It focuses on the lack of a tsunami threat.
* **D: ምንቅጥቃጥ ምድሪ ከጋጥም ከሎ መጠን ዕቤት ዘለዎ ብቕዓት ኣየማልአን (The ground cracks did not cause damage to houses):** Ground cracks are a possible consequence of an earthquake, but again, the passage doesn't link the *absence* of a warning to the lack of damage from ground cracks.



"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ እቲ ምንቅጥቃጥ ምድሪ እንታይ ኣስዒቡ?,"The correct answer is **A: ዝሰንበዱ ደቂ ዓዲ (Earthquakes)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the earthquake had a magnitude of 6.5. While there wasn't a tsunami warning issued, the shaking caused disruptions to daily life. This directly points to the event being an earthquake. The text mentions ""ራዕዲ መሬት"" which translates to ""earthquake"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ስግኣት ሱናሚ (Tsunami warning):** The text explicitly states that there *wasn't* a tsunami warning.
*   **C: ዝተዋህበ መጠንቀቕታ (Issued warning):** While warnings weren't issued, the core event is the earthquake itself.
*   **D: 6.5 ናይ ማግኒትዩድ ስኬል (6.5 magnitude scale):** This describes the strength of the earthquake but not the event itself. The earthquake *is* the event.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the text describes an **earthquake (ዝሰንበዱ ደቂ ዓዲ)**."
ካብዚኦም ኣየናይ እዩ ንንጥፈታት ጸሓይን ካልኦት ኩሎም ከዋኽብትን ዝድርኽ?,"The correct answer is **B: ሮሲ ቁጽሪ፡ ምዝዋር፡ ከምኡውን ማግኔታዊ ምግልባጥ**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""ፀሓይ ምስ ካልኦት ከዋኽብቲ ብሓንሳብ ኣብ ተመሳሳሊ መሰረታዊ መትከላት ከምትሰርሕ ፈለጡ-ብስርዓት ውሽጢ ዘለዉ ናይ ኩለን ከዋኽብቲ ምንቅስቓስ ብብርሃን ፣ብዑደንተን ንከምኡውን ብኻልእ ነገር ከምዝምርሓ ተፈሊጡ""  (The sun was found to operate under similar fundamental mechanisms as other stars – the movement of all stars within a system in light, heat, and other things.)

* **The passage further explains:** ""ድምቀትን ዙረትን ኮኾብ ምስ ዋሕዚ ፕላዝማ ዝምድና ዘለዎ ናይ ሓደ ኮኾብ ቁጽሪ ሮዝቢ ንምርካብ ይጠቅሙ። እቲ ናይ ሮዝብይ ቑፅሪ ንኡሽተይ ብዝኾነ ቁጽሪ፣ እቲ ኮኾብ ምስ ማግኔታዊ ምቅይያር ክነፃፀር ከሎ ዝነአሰ ንቅሓት ይህልዎ"" (The core of a star, related to the primordial plasma, is used to power heat and light. The rosby number gives a small amount, which gives a significant burst when the star is compared to a magnetic field.)

Therefore, the fundamental mechanisms that connect the sun to other stars are:

* **Rosby number (ሮሲ ቁጽሪ):** This relates to the core process of generating heat and light.
* **Heat (ምዝዋር):**  Also generated in the core and released as energy.
* **Magnetic field (ማግኔታዊ ምግልባጥ):**  The star's magnetic field influences its activity and interactions.

Options A, C, and D are incomplete and don't fully reflect the mechanisms described in the passage."
ናይ ሓደ ኮኾብ ቁጽሪ ሮስቢ ብኸመይ ይውሰን?,"The correct answer is **D: መጠን ማግነታዊ ለውטי** (Amount of magnetic change).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ናይ ሮዝብይ ቑፅሪ ንኡሽተይ ብዝኾነ ቁጽሪ፣ እቲ ኮኾብ ምስ ማግኔታዊ ምቅይያር ክነፃፀር ከሎ ዝነአሰ ንቅሓት ይህልዎ"" which translates to ""The Rossby number of a star is affected by the amount of magnetic change when the star is compared to its magnetic field.""

Therefore, the Rossby number is related to the *amount of magnetic change* the star experiences.

The text states: ""34 ካብ ሚኢቲ ዝኸውን እዚ ኣመለኻኽታ ነዚ ዝድግፉ ክኾኑ ከለዉ..."". This translates to ""34 out of 100 of this sentiment were those who supported it..."" meaning 34% supported Australia becoming a republic.
"

Here's why:

The text states: "" ቀዳማይ ሚኒስተር ምክንኻን ጁልያ ጊላርድድ ኣብቲ ብ2010 ዝተገብረ ፈደራላዊ መረጻ ኣብ መወዳእታ ግዝኣት ንግስቲ ኤልሳቤጥ ስልጣን ኣውስትራልያ ኣውስትራልያ ኣውስትራልያ ኣውስትራልያ ኣውስትራልያ ኣውስትራልያ ኣውስትራልያ ኣውስትራልያ ሪፓብሊክ ክትከውን ከም ዘለዋ ኸም ዝኣምኑ ገለጹ.""

This translates to: ""Chief of Staff Julia Gillard stated that in the final election of the 2010 federal election, Australia should become a republic with Queen Elizabeth's position.""  

Therefore, according to Julia Gillard, Australia becoming a republic was *after* the reign of Queen Elizabeth.

The text states: ""ስቲርንስ ከም ኣቦወንበር ናይቲ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽላል ናይ ገዛ ጸዓትን ንግድን ኮሚቴ ዝርከብ..."" which translates to ""Stearns as chairman of the Committee on Governance and Nominating...""

Therefore, the Committee on Governance and Nominating is the entity conducting the legal investigation.
"

The text explicitly states: ""ስቲርንስ ከም ኣቦወንበር ናይቲ ኣብ ትሕቲ ጽላል ናይ ገዛ ጸዓትን ንግድን ኮሚቴ ዝርከብ..."" which translates to ""Stearns as chairman of the Committee on Governance and Nominating...""

The question asks which company presented the ASUS Eee PC at the 2007 Taipei IT show. The passage clearly states that ASUS introduced the Eee PC at that event.
"
ASUS Eee(ኤሰስ ኢኢኢ) ላፕቶፕ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ላፕቶፕ (Laptop)**.

The text explicitly states that the ASUS Eee PC was released as a laptop and was a significant topic at the 2007 Taipei IT event. It also describes it as a small and innovative laptop.
"
በቲ ዝጠፍአ ሰነዳት ፖስታ መን እዩ ተሓታቲ?,"The correct answer is **A: ሰራሕተኛታት ፖስታ (Postal workers)**.

This clearly indicates that the postal workers at the office were handling the documents and refusing to accept the registered letters. Therefore, the postal workers were involved in the handling of the documents.
"

Here's why:

The text states that the head of the postal office, upon realizing they hadn't processed over 429 New Year's postcards, *informed the public and the media*. This indicates the head of the postal office expressed frustration *to the media*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ነበርቲ እቲ ከባቢ (Local residents):** While local residents were affected by the postal office's inability to handle the cards, the text specifically mentions the head of the postal office informing the public *and the media*, not the residents themselves.
*   **B: እቲ ወዲ (The boy):** The text doesn't mention a boy at all.
*   **D: ቤት ጽሕፈት ፖስታ ኦባናዛዋ (Obanazawa Post Office):** While the postal office is the one responsible, the text indicates *the head of the postal office* expressed frustration to the media, not the postal office itself.

The text states: ""ዴል ፖትሮ ናይ ቅድሚት ዕድል ነይርዎም፣ ኮይኑ ግን ድሕሪ 6-6 ምብፅሖም ዕረፍቲ የድሊ ነይሩ"" which translates to ""Del Potro had a previous opportunity, but after the score reached 6-6, he failed to win a set."" This indicates the opportunity was *before* the first set point where he failed to secure the set.

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
ውጽኢት ቀዳማይ ማዕረ ዕረፍቲ እንታይ እዩ ነይሩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ኣብ ካልኣይ ሰት ድማ ዴል ፖትሮ ተዓዊቱ (In the second set, Del Potro won.)**

Here's why:

The passage states: "" ኣብቲ ካልኣይ እኩብ ዴል ፖትሮ ናይ ቅድሚት ዕድል ነይርዎም, ኮይኑ ግን ድሕሪ 6-6 ምብፅሖም ዕረፍቲ የድሊ ነይሩ.""  This translates to ""In the second set, Del Potro had a chance from a previous opportunity, but after reaching 6-6, he failed to win.""

Then it continues: ""ፖትሮ ኣብዚ ጊዜ ናብ መንኩብ ክንክን ምስተገበሮ ናብ ጸወታ ክምለስ ክኢሉ ።"" This means ""Potro, at this time, went to the net and was able to return to the game.""  The implication is that he won the second set after the tiebreak.

Therefore, option D accurately reflects this outcome.

Therefore, the answer is children.

Therefore, the administrator reassured the citizens of Texas that the system was functioning correctly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ድሕንነት ህዝቢ ንምሕላው ዝግበሩ ነገራት ይሰርሑ ኣለው (Things that promote the unity of the people are working.)** While the initial part of the text mentions efforts towards unity, the administrator's specific reassurance was about the *system's* functionality, not the effectiveness of the unity efforts.
* **C: ነቲ ብድሆ ንምግጣም ተዓጢቖም ኣለዉ (They are taking precautions against the spread of the disease.)** The text mentions precautions, but the administrator's reassurance was specifically about the system working well.
* **D: እቲ ጉዳይ ዕቱብ ኣይኮነን (The issue is not serious.)**  While the administrator calls the issue ""minor,"" the primary reassurance was about the system working correctly, not just that the issue wasn't serious.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions The Onion's growth into a 24-hour news network, music streaming, and a world map. It also mentions its online presence and significant readership. However, it doesn't mention The Onion creating or being involved in film production. The other options are all mentioned:

* **A: ኣትላስ ዓለም (Atlas World)** - This is mentioned as part of The Onion's world map.
* **C: መርበብ ሓበሬታ (News aggregation)** - The passage states The Onion is a pioneer in news aggregation.
* **D: ሕትመት ዝሓዘ ሕታም (Printed satire)** - The passage mentions The Onion's satirical articles.

Option B accurately reflects this statement. The other options are incorrect because:

* **A:** The text implies the results might be *helpful* for those with shingles, not definitively *effective*.
* **C:** The text doesn't mention a cure being possible.
* **D:** The text explicitly states that the results don't show any change for those with type 1 shingles.

The passage states: ""ልክዕ ከም ካልኦት ምሁራን ንሱ እውን ናይ ሽኮር ሕማም ይሕከም ዶ ኣይሕከምን አብ ዝብል ይጠራጠር እዩ፣ ምኽንያቱም እቶም ዝተረኸቡ ውጺኢታት ንዓይነት 1 ሽኮር ዘለዎም ሰባት ምንም ዓይነት ለውጢ ከምጽኡ ስለዘይከኣל"" (Like other scholars, he also doubts whether he treats the disease, because the results obtained do not show any change in people with Type 1 diabetes).

Dr. Urd is questioning whether his research is relevant *because* the results don't show any impact on people with Type 1 diabetes.  He's essentially wondering if his work has any practical value for that specific group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኽፍወሱ ዝኽእሉ እንተ ዀይኖም** (If they can be improved): The passage doesn't mention anything about the results *potentially* being improved.
*   **C: ርእይቶ ካልኦት ክኢላታት ብዛዕባ ፈውሲ** (Views of other experts about the cause): The passage focuses on the results' relevance to patients, not other experts' views on the cause of diabetes.
*   **D: እቶም ሕማም ሽኮር ዘይብሎም ኣናጹ ከምኡ ኮይኖም ዝጸንሑ እንተኾይኖም** (If the non-diabetic controls remained unchanged): While the passage mentions the non-diabetic controls, Dr. Urd's main concern isn't about their unchanged state; it's about the *lack of impact* on diabetic patients.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ መግለጺታት ኣየናይ እዩ ብዛዕባ ምውዳቕ ነፋሪት CG4684 ብልክዕ ዘይገልጽ?,"The correct answer is **C: እታ ነፋሪት ቅድሚ ምውዳቓ ሰለስተ ግዜ ክትዓልብ ፈቲና ነይራ** (The plane tried to take off three times before the crash).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the plane attempted to take off on the first attempt but failed. It also mentions a delay of ten minutes before a second attempt. However, there is **no information** in the text about the plane trying to take off three times before the crash.

The other options are supported by the text:

* **A: እታ ነፋሪት ኣብ መጀመርታ ብሰንኪ ኩነታት ኣየር ክትዓልብ ኣይከኣለትን** (The plane couldn't take off initially due to weather conditions) -  The text mentions ""ሕማቕ ኩነታት ኣየር"" (adverse weather conditions).
* **B: እታ ነፋሪት ኣብ ኣዝዩ ርሑቕ ቦታ እያ ተሓምሺሻ** (The plane was flying in a very remote location) - The text states the crash occurred in a remote area with a forest nearby.
* **D: እታ ነፋሪት ዝወደቐትሉ ቦታ ንምድላይ ዝግበር ዝነበረ ኣለሻ ብሰንኪ ኩነታት ኣየር ተጸልዩ** (The approach slope, which was used for landing, was disrupted due to weather conditions) - The text mentions weather conditions as the cause of the crash.

Here's why:

The text states: ""እቲ ፍተሻ ነቲ ኣውሮፕላን ንከይዓርፍ ዝገበሮ ሕማቕ ኩነታት ኣየር ተኣጓጉሉ እዩ"" which translates to ""The inspection revealed that the bad weather conditions caused the plane to deviate.""

Option D directly reflects this information. The other options are not supported by the text.

ካብቲ ጥቕሲ ብምብጋስ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ብዛዕባ ተመኩሮ ፍራንሲዘክ ኮዋል ካብ ዝተዋህቡ መግለጺታት ኣየናይ’ዩ ሓቂ?,"The correct answer is **B: ኣብ መወዳእታ ድማ ኣይተጎድአን (He didn't die in the end)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Franciszek Kołak ""ብህይወት ዝተረፈ"" (lived and died). This directly contradicts option B, which claims he didn't die.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the text:

* **A: መስኮት ክሰብር ክኢሉ (He was able to open the windows):** The passage explicitly says, ""...እቶም መስኮታት ግን ኣይስበሩን ነይሮም። “ኣብ መወዳእታ ካብቶም መሳዂቲ ሓደ ተሰይሩ፣ ንሶም ድማ ብመስኮት ምውጽእ ጀሚሮም” ክብል ብህይወት ዝተረፈ ፍራንሲዜክ ኮዋል ሓቢሩ.""  ( ""...the windows weren't open. ""In the end, one of the workers went up, and they started coming through the windows,"" said the living Franciszek Kołak."") This indicates he was able to open the windows.
* **C: ክወጽእ እናፈተነ ሓደ መንበር ሰይሩ (One worker sat down while opening a window):** The passage states, ""אብ መወዳእታ ድማ ሓደ ተሰይሩ፣ ንሶም ድማ ብመስኮት ምውጽእ ጀሚሮም"" (...in the end, one of the workers went up, and they started coming through the windows). This implies a worker sat down *while* the windows were being opened.
* **D: መስኮት ክሰብር ኣብ ዝፈተነሉ እዋን እዩ ተጎዲኡ ነይሩ (He died while opening the windows):** The passage says he *lived* and *died*.  The sentence about workers opening windows doesn't specify when or how Kołak died.  However, since the passage mentions he ""lived and died,"" and the window opening is connected to the workers' actions, it is possible he died during that time, making this option plausible.


Therefore, option B is the only definitively incorrect statement.

ትሮፒካል ህቦብላ ዳንየል ከስዕቦ ዝኽእል ጽልዋ ምግማት በዳሂ ዝዀነ ስለምንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: እቲ ህቦብላ ናብ ሃሪኬን ክሕይል ምዃኑ ይግመት** (The storm is predicted to strengthen into a hurricane).

Here's why:

The text states: ""ተመራመርቲ ሃገራዊ ማእኸል ሃሪኬን ብረቡዕ ዳንኤሌ ናብ ሃሪኬን ክብርትዕ ከምዝኽእል ይእምቱ。"" (National Hurricane Center forecasters predict Tropical Storm Daniel could strengthen into a hurricane.)

This prediction of strengthening into a hurricane is the reason why the storm surge is a concern.  A hurricane is much more powerful than a tropical storm and produces a significantly larger and more dangerous storm surge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ተመራመርቲ ስነ-ፍልጠት ብዛዕባ’ቲ ህቦብላ ቀጸልቲ ንፋሳት ርግጸኛታት ኣይኮኑን** (Forecasters are not confident about the storm's future winds) - The text actually *does* express confidence in the potential for strengthening.
* **C: እቲ ህቦብላ ካብ ምድረበዳ ርሒቑ ይርከብ** (The storm is moving over land) - The text states the storm is *far* from land, which is the opposite of the situation described here.
* **D: እቲ ህቦብላ ካብ ሚያሚ ኣዝዩ ርሒቑ ዝርከብ እዩ** (The storm is very far from Miami) - While the storm is far from Miami, the *potential* for a dangerous storm surge is the reason for concern, not just its distance.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that the hurricane is far from land (""ካብ መሬት ኣዝዩ ዝረሓቐ ብምዃኑ""). This means there is no storm surge in the Caribbean.
*   Options B, C, and D are all mentioned or implied in the text:
    *   **B: ኣብ ኣትላንቲክ ውቅያኖስ እዩ ተፈጢሩ** (It formed in the Atlantic Ocean) - Directly stated in the first sentence.
    *   **C: ናብ ህቦብላ ንፋስ ክቕየር ይኽእል እዩ** (It can change direction) - The text mentions that National Hurricane Center forecasters are considering whether Hurricane Daniel could become a major hurricane, implying a change in wind patterns and direction is possible.
    *   **D: ናብ መሬት ንምብጻሕ ቀሪቡ’ዩ** (It is close to making landfall) - The text states that the hurricane being far from land is concerning because it could hit the US or Caribbean, meaning it could get closer to land.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እቶም ናይ ጉንፋዕ ምልክታት እንተደኣ ቀለልቲ ኮይኖም፣ ሕሙማት ዕለታዊ መነባብረኦም ኣብ ዘካይድሉ እዋን ናብ ብዙሓት ሰባት ከመሓላልፍዎ ይኽእል እዮም ዝብል ስግኣት አሎ।"" (If the symptoms are mild, the sick people can spread it to many people during the period when they are contagious.)

And it also mentions: ""ሓደ ሓደ መጽናዕትታት ከምዝሕብርዎ እዚ ሕማም ብዓለምለኸ ደረጃ ለበዳ ቅድሚ ምፍጣరు ናይ ምቅታል ዓቅሙ ዝነኣሰ ክኸዉን ኣለዎ ኢዩ。"" (One study suggests that this disease has the potential to escalate its mortality at the global level before an outbreak.)

These points indicate that a mild infection, spread to many people, could lead to a more widespread and potentially deadly outbreak if not contained. Option C reflects this concern about the virus spreading to a large number of people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ውሑድ ቀታሊ ክኸውን ኣለዎ** (Should be a low fatality rate): While the passage expresses concern about mortality, it doesn't say the fatality rate *should* be low. It's the *potential* for escalation that's being highlighted.
*   **B: እቲ ምልክታት ቀሊል ኮይኑ ክቕጽል ኣለዎ** (The symptoms should be mild and persist): The passage actually warns *against* mild symptoms, as they facilitate spread.
*   **D: ህጻናት ምልክታት ከርእዩ ኣለዎም** (Children should have symptoms): The passage doesn't mention anything specific about children having symptoms.

Here's why:

* The text states the government **didn't** allow additional carriers in March.  The sentence says the government *rejected* a proposal to increase carriers.
* The text does mention that 300 carriers were already transporting a total of 1,300 units. 
* Option A directly reflects the situation *before* the government's decision. The fact that there were ""more carriers until this March"" implies a situation where capacity was already exceeding desired levels.
* Options B, C, and D describe actions (increasing carriers) or outcomes (number of carriers) that *didn't* happen according to the text.

Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately reflects a state that existed *prior to* the government's rejection of the additional carriers.

Here's why:

* The text states that the government's plan was to add 300 more carriers in March to alleviate the transportation problem.
* Option A directly reflects this information.
* Options B and C are incorrect because the text doesn't mention a plan to solve the problem generally or to add 1300 carriers.
* Option D is incorrect because the text indicates a plan for March, not a problem lasting until March.

Here's why:

The quote states: ""ንዘይተርፍ መጥቃዕቲ ዝእንፍት ዝኮነ ሓበሬታ የለን። ናብ ከቢድ ዘብፅሕ ስግኣት ዋላ እኳ እንተቀነሰ እቲ ስግኣት ሙሉእ ብሙሉእ ጠፊኡ እዩ ማለት ኣይኮነን።""

This translates to: ""There is no information that the infection is not being treated. Even if the infection becomes severe, it doesn't mean the infection is completely eliminated.""

The key takeaway is that even if the infection gets severe, the *level* or *stage* of the infection is still being observed. The quote emphasizes that even with severe infection, the infection isn't necessarily completely gone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ድሕሪ ሕጂ ዝኾነ ስግኣት የለን (There is no infection now):** The quote directly contradicts this. It says even if the infection is severe, it doesn't mean it's completely eliminated.
* **C: መጥቃዕቲ ክፍጸም ትጽቢት ይግበር (Treatment is administered):**  The quote states that there's no information on whether treatment is being administered or not. It focuses on the infection's level.
* **D: እቲ መጥቃዕቲ ከቢድ ከምዝኸውን ስለያዊ ሓበሬታ ኣረጋጊጹ ኣሎ (The severity of the infection has been confirmed through reliable information):** While the quote mentions severity, it doesn't confirm the severity through reliable information. It discusses what information *isn't* available, implying a lack of complete certainty about the infection's severity.

Here's why:

* The question asks what statement *isn't* true about the protests. The text explicitly states that the Presidential Commission was presented as a way to respond to the widespread legal-political protests that began in October.
* Let's look at why the other options are likely true:
    * **B: ግዜኡ ዝሓለፎ መረጻ ነቲ ተቓውሞታት ኣበጊስዎ (The delayed elections fueled the protests):** The text mentions that the protests were related to the lack of elections and that some had been ongoing since 2011. A delayed election would certainly exacerbate those feelings.
    * **C: ተቓውሞታት እቲ ቅድሚኡ ዝነበረ CEP ካብ ስልጣኑ ክወርድ ይጠልብ ነይሩ (The protests required the previous CEP to be removed from power):** The text indicates the protests were a response to the previous CEP and its actions (or lack thereof).
    * **D: እቲ ተቓውሞ ሓድሓደ ግዜ ዓመጽ ዝመልኦ እዩ ነይሩ (The protests were intense for a sustained period):** The text refers to ""large-scale demonstrations"" and protests ongoing since 2011, implying intensity and duration.



Therefore, the Presidential Commission being a *response* is the statement that isn't inherently untrue, as the other options align with the information given in the text."

This translates to: ""USA Gymnastics' investigation revealed that Larry Nassar's abuse for a long time was not addressed within the organization, and the organization is now undergoing a review and accepting changes.""

Therefore, the abuse wasn't addressed *within* the USA Gymnastics organization for a long time, and the organization is now accepting changes *within* the organization.  Options A, B, and D are not directly supported by the text's statement about the abuse not being addressed within the organization.

Here's why:

The text states that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the goal of creating an environment that ""promotes the pursuit of excellence for gymnasts and athletes alike, and fosters a positive and healthy competitive environment."" Option D, ""ንኣትሌታት ውሑስ ሃዋህው ምድንፋዕ"" (a healthy and positive competitive environment for athletes), best reflects this shared objective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ልዕሊ ግህሰት ላሪ ናሳር ብርሃን ምብራህ** (Shining a light on Larry Nassar's abuse): While the text mentions the investigation into Larry Nassar's abuse, it's presented as a factor that led to the need for change and a healthier environment, not the primary goal for the future.
*   **B: ምውጋድ ምስክር ወረቐት ምግባር** (Encouraging giving testimony): Similar to A, encouraging testimony is a consequence of the abuse and a factor in creating change, but not the overarching goal for the future.
*   **C: ናይ ብሕቲ መርመራ ምግባር** (Conducting thorough investigations): The investigation is mentioned, but it is not described as a primary goal for the future.

Here's why:

The text states that the hippos are a significant threat to the local ecosystem, damaging vegetation and competing with other animals. The authorities are hoping that by capturing and relocating the hippos, they can reduce the damage and allow the ecosystem to recover.  Fostering the breeding of hippos is *not* what they are hoping for - it would exacerbate the problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምፍጣር ገማግም ባሕሪ (Creating a new desert):** The opposite of what they are hoping to happen.
* **C: ቁጽሪ ናይ ሃምፕባክ ቻብስ ምውሳኽ (Reducing the number of hippos):** This is what they are *trying* to do, but it's not the *hope* they have as a result of the hippos' capture.
* **D: ተወሳኺ መነባብሮ እንስሳ ዘገዳም (Protecting other resident animals):** While protecting other animals is a good goal, the text doesn't explicitly state that the relocation of the hippos is *expected* to achieve this.  The primary hope is ecological recovery, not just animal protection.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: "" ዋላኳ ደረጃ ብራኸ እቲ ማይ ድሕሪ እቲ ውሑጅ ናይ ቅሩብ ጫማታት ጥራሕ እንተኾነ፡ ሰበ ስልጣናት እዚ ኣብ ታሕተዋይ መፋስስ ንዝህሉ ምሽርሻር ሓመድ ንምግታእ እኹል ክኸውን እዩ ኢሎም ተስፋ ይገብሩ። **ንሱ ድማ ከም ሃምፕባክ ቹብ ዝበሉ ዓሳት የጠቓል Merchandise**"" which translates to: ""The water level after the unusual close of the boats was only shallow; authorities hope that this will allow Hamad to be caught in the depths. **He is also like a humpback whale**"".

The passage compares Hamad to a humpback whale, indicating that the whale's characteristics are relevant to understanding the nature of the trap.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሳንድባርስ (Sandbar)**:  While sandbars might be present, the passage doesn't connect the trap's construction to sandbars.
*   **C: መነባብሮ እንስሳ ዘገዳም (Predatory animal)**: The passage mentions predatory animals in general, but specifically compares Hamad to a humpback whale, making this option less precise.

Here's why:

* The question asks which person is *not* a lawyer.
* The text explicitly states that Sakis Chagioglou, George Nikolaikopoulos, and Petros Mantouvalos are lawyers who have been convicted of bribery and corruption.
* The text identifies Makis Triantafyloppoulos as a journalist who reported on the scandal. He is not mentioned as being a lawyer.

The text explicitly states that the lawyers, Sakis Kagioglou and George Nikolaokopoulos, were convicted of bribery and corruption. This means they are part of the legal system who have acted unethically. The text also mentions judges and other legal officials have been implicated.

Therefore, lawyers are the group within the Greek legal community who have been found to have acted unethically.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Adam Kurden expressed anger *specifically* about Wales's handling of the change in policy regarding sexual orientation. He accuses Wales of initially excluding them and then later dismissing their concerns.

Options A, B, and C all relate to the core issue of the policy change and Wales's role in it, which is what Kurden is upset about. Option D, however, is about *criticism* of Welsh artistic unions – it's a related topic but not the direct cause of Kurden's anger as described in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states that Adam Kurden's comments and the resulting policy change regarding ""ጾታዊ ትሕዝቶ"" (sexual content) angered many viewers. The core of the controversy revolves around this topic.

The other options are less directly related to the central issue:

* **A: ስነ ጥበብ (Art):** While the context might involve art, the main point is the *content* of the art, specifically the sexual content.
* **C: ናይ ፖሊሲ ረቂቕ (Policy nuances):** The policy change itself is a result of the controversy, but not the central issue.
* **D: ብውልቂ ዝውነን ሚድያ (Sensationalized media):** While the media coverage might be sensational, the core of the disagreement is about the sexual content itself.

Here's why:

The passage states that Amir Khan's vision was to defeat the English competitors at the 2012 London Olympics.  The question asks who he *didn't* support based on the passage. The passage explicitly mentions him *not* supporting the English competitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ኦሎምፒክ ዝሳተፋ ደቂ ኣንስትዮ ተቓለስቲ ሓዊሱ (Female Olympic protesters)** - The passage doesn't mention female Olympic protesters.
*   **C: ናይ ደቂ ኣንስትዮ ርእይቶታት (Female visions)** - The passage mentions *his* vision, not female visions in general.
*   **D: ለንደን ኦሎምፒክ ምትእንጋዳ (The London Olympics)** - The passage discusses the London Olympics as the venue for his desired victory, but doesn't say he supported the Olympics themselves.

Here's why:

The passage states that Amir Khan felt like he was ""dancing inside his own women."" He envisioned himself defeating the British competitors at the 2012 Olympics.  The key is that his vision was *of the female competitors*.  Therefore, the answer is the female competitors themselves. The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: ካብ ኦሎምፒክ 2004 ዝመጹ መሳርሕቱ ተወዳደርቲ (Participants from the 2004 Olympics):** While Khan won in 2004, his vision wasn't specifically about *those* competitors.
* **C: ኦሎምፒክ 2012 (The 2012 Olympics):** The 2012 Olympics were the *setting* of his vision, not the target.
* **D: ካልኦት ተዓወትቲ ብሩር መዳልያ (Other gold medal winners):** The passage focuses specifically on the female competitors he envisioned defeating.

This translates to: ""While Peter Lenz was riding, his father, Xavier Lenz, who was behind him, fell off his bike. He then fell directly in front of Tom, who was on the road providing first aid. He was taken to the local hospital after examination, but ultimately died.""

Therefore, Peter Lenz died *after* falling from his motorcycle.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that the wind analogy is helpful for those who don't understand the journey or are anxious about the unknown.**  It suggests this analogy can alleviate anxiety by framing the unpredictable aspects of travel in a manageable way.
* **Option B directly addresses this core idea.** It states the analogy is useful when anxieties are linked to a lack of knowledge about the trip.
* **Options A, C, and D are less accurate:**
    * **A:**  While travelers should prepare, it's not just about preparation; it's about managing anxiety related to the unknown.
    * **C:**  The passage doesn't say the wind analogy is helpful *only* for negative experiences with travel.
    * **D:**  Anxieties can stem from various things related to the journey, not just problems with the flight itself.

Therefore, **B** best reflects the passage's intent and how the wind analogy can be applied in a situation of traveler anxiety."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that *before* buying a ticket, it's beneficial to check the airline's website for price comparisons and deals. Option D, ""መርበብ ሓበሬታ ናይ’ቲ መንገዲ ኣየር ምውካስ,"" directly aligns with this advice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ብዙሓት ናይ ጉዕዞ ኩባንያታት ኣቕርቦት ምድላይ (Comparing offers from many travel companies):** While helpful, the passage prioritizes checking the airline's *own* website first.
*   **B: ብቐጥታ ምስቲ መንገዲ ኣየር ትኬት ምግዛእ (Buying tickets directly from the airline):** The passage indicates this is generally the cheapest way, but it doesn't highlight it as something to do *before* price comparisons. It's the *outcome* of the comparison process.
*   **C: ኣብ መንጎ ብዙሓት ናይ ጉዕዞ ኩባንያታት ዋጋታት ምውድዳር (Comparing prices among many travel companies):**  Similar to A, this is a helpful step, but the passage emphasizes checking the airline's website *before* doing this.

Therefore, option D is the only one that directly reflects the advice given in the passage about the importance of checking the airline's website before making a purchase.

Here's why:

The passage states that because prices for the same flight can vary greatly across different booking platforms, it's important to check the airline's website *before* buying a ticket. This is to find the lowest price.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ መንጎ እተፈላለዩ ወገንቲ ዘሎ ዋጋታት ምንጽጻር (Comparing prices among different agents):** While comparing prices is a good idea, the passage specifically emphasizes checking the airline's website first.
* **C: ብቐጥታ ብመንገዲ ኣየር መንገዲ ትኬት ምግዛእ (Buying a ticket directly through the airline):** The passage suggests checking the airline's website *before* buying, not that buying directly is the primary step.

Here's why:

The passage states that flights can take many days due to delays in baggage handling. It then highlights that the *fastest* way to ensure a suitcase arrives is to have it checked through (i.e., inspected and tagged to the final destination).  

Option C directly reflects this idea of a checked suitcase being the quickest and most reliable method.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ነገራት ብናይ ኣየር ጽዕነት ክለኣኹ ከለዉ (that the luggage was put in the air cargo)**: While air cargo is an option, the passage implies that checked baggage (through baggage) is faster.
*   **B: እቲ ኩባንያ ናይ ገዛእ ርእሱ ነፈርቲ ክጥቀም ከሎ (that the company used its own aircraft)**:  The passage doesn't mention the airline using its own aircraft.
*   **D: እቲ ምብጻሕ ብዓቢ ትካል ክካየድ ከሎ (that the flight was carried out by a large corporation)**: The passage doesn't focus on the size of the corporation.

Here's why:

The initial statement emphasizes speed and efficiency in choosing an airline. It also mentions the potential for delays and the importance of considering airlines with similar issues.  Therefore, the primary concern should be the airline that offers the *most points* or value for the cost/effort. This is because maximizing points allows for future benefits (travel, rewards, etc.) and compensates for potential inconveniences like delays.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: እቲ ኣብ ዝዓበየ ጥምረት ዘሎ መንገዲ ኣየር (The airline with the most frequent flyer alliance)**: While alliances are good, the number of alliances isn't the *most* important factor when prioritizing speed and value.
* **C: እቲ ዝበዝሕ ግዜ እትጓዓዘሉ መንገዲ ኣየር (The airline you travel with the most)**:  This focuses on familiarity, not necessarily efficiency or value.
* **D: እቲ ተወሳኺ ፍሉይ መሰላት ክውስኽ ዝኽእል መንገዲ ኣየር (The airline that offers additional special amenities)**: Amenities are nice, but they are secondary to getting the best overall return on your investment, particularly in a situation where delays are a possibility.

Here's why:

The question asks which airline benefits the most from streamlining (reducing the number of flights). The prompt states that airlines operating within the same alliance can benefit from consolidating flights to avoid conflicts and potentially improve efficiency.  Therefore, the airlines operating in the same alliance are the ones that can benefit the most from streamlining.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: ኣብ ዝተፈላለየ ጥምረት ዝርከብ ዝተፈላለየ መንገዲ ኣየር (Airlines operating in different alliances):**  Consolidating flights across different alliances would likely create more conflicts and wouldn't be as beneficial as streamlining within the same alliance.
*   **B: ኣብ ትሕቲ ሓደ ኪዳን ብብዝሒ እትጓዓዙሉ መንገዲ ኣየርኹም (Airlines operating in large numbers under one alliance):** While operating under one alliance is helpful, it doesn't automatically mean that streamlining will lead to the biggest benefit. The key is *how* they operate within that alliance.
*   **D: ኣብ ውሽጢ ሓደ ጥምረት ዝርከብ ዝተፈለየ መንገዲ ኣየር (Airlines operating within one alliance, but with specific routes):** Focusing on specific routes within an alliance is helpful, but streamlining flights within the entire alliance would create more significant benefits.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically discusses the dangers of consuming alcohol.** It details the harm it can cause, including medical complications and death.
* **""ምሽታት"" (Drinking)** is the act of consuming alcohol.
* The other options – ""ምስማዕ"" (Listening), ""ምርኣይ"" (Seeing), and ""ምጥዓም"" (Smelling) – are senses and not related to alcohol consumption.

Therefore, the question asks which of the listed activities could lead to alcohol poisoning based on the text, and ""ምሽታት"" (drinking) is the only relevant option."

* The text states that the Jordaan (Mittlere Stadt) is located in Amsterdam's Binenstad.
* The text also mentions that the Canal District is a high-value area in Amsterdam, known for its beauty and history, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.
* The other options are either too general (B, C, D) or not directly supported by the provided text. While the Jordaan *is* part of a UNESCO site (B), the question asks about a *specific* area within Amsterdam. ""The Canal District"" is a well-known and distinct area within Amsterdam that fits the description of a high-value, historic area.

The text explicitly states that Canal District is considered a UNESCO World Heritage site due to its ""ታሪኻውን ባህላውን ዋጋ"" which translates to ""historical and cultural value"". While options B, C, and D might be true to some extent, they aren't the primary reason for the UNESCO designation. The core reason is the historical and cultural significance of the area.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ናፍቲ ቤተመቅደስ ንምእታው ናይ ኣንግኮር መጎብነዪ ትኬት የድሊ እዩ፣ ስለዚ ናብ ቶንሌ ሳፕ ክትከድ ከለኻ ፓስፖርትካ ሒዝካ ክትኸይድ አለካ። **ጉዕዞ ናብቲ ቦታ ብ ቀላይ ምስ ዝጉዓዝ ጀልባ ዝተትሓሓዘ ክኸውን ይኽእል**።"" (The temple does not require a ticket for Angkor visitors, so if you travel to Tonle Sap, you need to bring your passport. **The journey to the place can be taken by boat.**)

The question asks what *isn't* mentioned as a cost associated with visiting Phnom Krom. The passage details:

*   **The boat journey to Tonle Sap:** This is a way to reach the area, and implies a cost for the boat trip.
*   **The view over Tonle Sap:** The passage describes the view over Tonle Sap and connects it to the flooding and hardship. It is a visual experience associated with the location.
*   **Visiting Siem Reap:** The passage mentions Phnom Krom is *near* Siem Reap, and it’s a tourist destination in its own right. 
*   **Using an Angkor Pass:** While mentioning the temple doesn't need an Angkor pass, the passage mentions that traveling to Tonle Sap requires a passport and possibly indicates there are fees for navigating around the area.

Therefore, the view over Tonle Sap is the *least* likely cost mentioned because it is a descriptive element of the location, not a direct expense.

The text states: ""ናፍቲ ቤተመቅደስ ንምእታው ናይ ኣንግኮር መጎብነዪ ትኬት የድሊ ስለዚ ናብ ቶንሌ ሳፕ ክትከድ ከለኻ ፓስፖርትካ ሒዝካ ክትኸይድ አለካ።"" (To visit the temple, you need an Angkor Pass, so if you go to Tonle Sap, you should bring your passport.)

This directly indicates that you need an Angkor Pass to visit the temple, and you should bring your passport. Option C, "" ንኣንግኮር ፓስ ምርካብ"" (Get an Angkor Pass) reflects this requirement.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ዙርያ ሲም ሪፕ ምጉዓዝ (Go around Siem Reap):** While you might go around Siem Reap, the text doesn't say this is *necessary* to reach Phnom Krom.
*   **B: ኣብ ዙርያ ቶንለ ሳፕ ጃልባ ምዝዋር (Row around Tonle Sap):** The text mentions Tonle Sap, but it's in relation to needing an Angkor Pass for the temple. Rowing around Tonle Sap is not mentioned as a requirement to visit Phnom Krom.
*   **D: ንቤተ መቕደስ ያሶቫርማን ሓሊፉ ምድያብ (Travel to the temple of Jayavarman):** While it's the destination, the question asks what you *need* to travel there, which is an Angkor Pass."

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Antarctic exploration is limited to a short window (January-February) and primarily confined to the coastal regions (Ross Sea and Weddell Sea).** It also mentions that during the winter months, the number of researchers is significantly reduced.
* **Limited physical mobility directly conflicts with the nature of Antarctic exploration.**  The passage implies that movement within Antarctica is difficult due to the ice cover.  Someone with limited physical mobility would be severely restricted from participating in the exploration during the limited window and within the coastal regions.

Let's look at why the other options are *not* the correct answer:

* **A: ሰፊሕ ናይ መገሻ ባጀት (Large research budget):** A large budget could help overcome some logistical challenges, even with limited mobility.
* **B: ንሮዝ ሲ ንምድህሳስ ብሕታዊ ተገዳስነት (Focus on Ross Sea and Weddell Sea with biological research):**  This is a specific research focus and doesn't inherently exclude someone with limited mobility.  Research could be conducted within the accessible coastal areas.
* **C: ኣብ ታሕሳስን ጥርን ንምጕዓዝ ዘኽእል መደብ ስራሕ (Work schedule that allows travel in December and January):** This schedule aligns with the short exploration window mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, the only option that directly contradicts the constraints of Antarctic exploration as described in the passage is limited physical mobility.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ሓሓሊፉ ክኢላታት ዳህሰሳ ኣየር ናብ ውሽጢ መሬት፣ ናብ እንባታት ምውጻእ ወይ ድማ ዓብዪ መሰረት ናብ ዘለዎ ዓንዲ ንምብጻሕ ይኸዱ እዮም።"" (Scientists use drilling air to go inside the ground, to the ice sheets, or to a large foundation with a base for research.)

The inland region of Antarctica is characterized by a thick ice sheet (2-3 km thick).  Therefore, research involving drilling *into* the ice sheets would primarily occur in the inland region.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: እቲ ሮዝ ሲ (The Ross Sea):** The passage mentions research in the Ross Sea, but it doesn't specifically state that drilling *into ice sheets* would be the primary research activity there.
* **C: እቲ ፔኒንሱላ (The Peninsula):**  The Peninsula is a coastal region and generally has thinner ice compared to the inland region. While research *might* occur there, deep drilling into ice sheets is less likely.
* **D: እቲ ገማግም ባሕሪ (The Coastal Sea):** Similar to the Ross Sea, research in the coastal sea is mentioned, but not specifically tied to deep ice sheet drilling.

ቅድመ-ዘመናዊ መዐዘቢ ኣበይ ክህሉ ዝወሓደ ተኽእሎ ኣለዎ?,"The correct answer is **C: ኣብ ርሑቕ ቦታታት (In remote locations)**.

This indicates that pre-modern observatories were also typically located in remote, rural areas, and the passage implies this is a consistent pattern. Therefore, option C is the most accurate.
"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""መብዛሕትኦም ዘመናዊ ናይ መጽናዕቲ ቴሌስኮፓት ምቹው ኩነታት ኣየር ኣብ ዘለዎም ገጠር ቦታታት ዕዙዝ መሳርሒታት እዮም።""  This translates to ""Most modern learning telescopes are found in rural locations with favorable weather conditions.""
* **University observatories** are specifically designed to house and operate telescopes, often located in areas with clear skies and minimal light pollution. 
* **The other options are less likely:**
    * **A: ኣብ ሙዝየም (At a museum):** Museums might *display* telescopes, but they aren't typically used for active research.
    * **C: ኣብ ሓደ ትምህርቲ ቦታ (At an educational institution):** While some educational institutions might have telescopes, they wouldn't usually have the advanced facilities needed for serious research.
    * **D: ኣብ ሓደ ዓብዪ መሳለጥያ (At a large research facility):**  While a large research facility *could* have an observatory, a university observatory is a more common and appropriate location for research telescopes.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Northern Harbour District (located in the Northern Harbour Ward) is known for its *highly developed and altered* waterfront, and many of its docks have *pohutukawa trees*. The question asks which location is known for a *picturesque* waterfront.  The description of the Northern Harbour District aligns best with the idea of a picturesque waterfront due to its development and the presence of pohutukawa trees, which are often associated with scenic coastal locations.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ሴንት ሄሊየርስ (St Heliers):** While it has docks, the passage doesn't specifically highlight it as being particularly picturesque or having pohutukawa trees.
* **B: ሚሽን ቤይ (Mission Bay):** Similar to St Heliers, the passage doesn't emphasize its picturesque qualities.
* **D: ወደብ ዋይተማታ (Waiwata Harbour):** The passage mentions docks there, but it's not described in a way that suggests it's particularly picturesque.

Therefore, the Northern Harbour District is the most fitting answer based on the information provided."

Here's why:

The text states: ""ናይ ሰሜን ገምገም ናይ ባሕሪ (ኣብ ሰሜን ወደብ ኣውራጃ ) ኣብ ልዕሊ ፓስፊክ ውቅያኖስ ይርከቡ ከምኡውን ካብ ሰሜን ነዊሕ ናይ ባሕሪ መሬት ክሳብ ዲቮንፖርት ኣብ ደቡብ ይዝርጋሕ."" This translates to: ""The Northern Waiheke coastal area (in the Northern Waiheke District) runs along the Pacific Ocean and extends from the northernmost coastal land to Devonport in the south.""

This indicates that the Northern Waiheke District is the furthest point south among the locations mentioned, making it the most southerly and therefore the most distant from the other options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣውራጃ ሰሜን ወደብ (Northern Waiheke District):**  While it *is* mentioned, the question asks where the situation of the coastal area is *most* reduced (wuhus kakhown). The text doesn't give information about reduction, but rather about the geographical extent.
* **C: ማእከላዊ ኦክላንድ (Central Auckland):** The text states that Long Bay, Devonport, and St Heliers (Central Auckland) have marinas. It doesn't indicate that Central Auckland is the furthest point.
* **D: ሎንግ ቤይ (Long Bay):** Long Bay is mentioned as having marinas in Central Auckland, and it's geographically closer to Auckland city than the Northern Waiheke District.

Therefore, based on the geographical information provided, the Northern Waiheke District is the most southerly location.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes respecting the Holocaust memorial site and not defacing it.  Option B, marking the area around the site, is the only option that aligns with respect and preservation, rather than damaging or defiling the memorial. The other options are all forms of disrespect:

* **A: ልባዊ ስጕምቲ ምውሳድ (Emotional distress):** While the Holocaust is emotionally distressing, the question asks about what *shouldn't* be done *at the site*.
* **C: ቀልዲ ምግባር (Vandalism):** This is a form of defacement and disrespect.
* **D: ንሓደ መዋቕር ምጽሕታር (Constructing a monument):**  While a monument might be appropriate *somewhere*, the passage specifically warns against defacing the existing memorial site.

ካብዚኦም ንቋንቋታት ሊንጉዋ ፍራንካስ ዝገልጽ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **C: ዝተሃንጸ (Artificial)**.

The passage states that *Linguas Francas* are languages created by humans (ሰብ ሰራሕ or ሰብ ዝተሃንጹ). The question asks how to describe them, and the passage specifies they are ""ተሃንጹ"" - meaning artificial or constructed.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሰብ ሰራሕ (Human-made):** While true, it doesn't describe the *nature* of the language itself.
*   **B: ዘይተፈጥሮኣዊ (Non-natural):** This is a valid descriptor, but ""ዝተሃንጸ"" (artificial) is a more direct and commonly used term in this context.
*   **D: ኦርጋኒክ (Organic):** This is the opposite of what a *Lingua Franca* is. Organic languages evolve naturally over time.

Here's why:

* **The original text** defines auxiliary languages as languages created to help people who have difficulty communicating with each other due to different native languages. These languages are often based on existing languages (like Lingua Franca).

* **Option A** accurately reflects this definition by stating that auxiliary languages are ""organic languages used to facilitate communication between people who cannot easily understand each other."" This captures the core purpose of auxiliary languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ተፈጥሮኣዊን ዝተሃንጸን ቋንቋታት እዮም (They are natural and constructed languages.)** While auxiliary languages *can* be constructed (like Lingua Franca), the definition doesn't require them to be constructed. Natural languages can also be auxiliary languages.

* **C: ኣጸጋሚ ናይ ርክብ ኣጋጣምታት ንምምሕያሽ ዝተሃንጹ ቋንቋታት እዮም (They are constructed languages designed to avoid communication barriers.)**  This is too negative. Auxiliary languages aren't necessarily ""designed to avoid barriers"" in a negative sense; they're designed to *remove* them.

* **D: ኣብ መንጎ ተዛረብቲ ዝተፈላለዩ ቋንቋታት ዓብላሊ ኮይኖም ዝተፈጥሩ ቋንቋታት እዮም (They are languages that have been created among speakers of different languages.)** This is partially true (they are created *among* speakers of different languages), but it doesn't fully capture the *purpose* of auxiliary languages, which is to *facilitate* communication.



Therefore, **Option A** is the most accurate description of auxiliary languages based on the provided text.

The text states: ""ተሳፈርቲ መርከብ ቪዛ ክረኽቡ ኣይፍቀደሎምን"" which translates to ""Passengers are not allowed to obtain a visa."" This directly indicates that visa requirements are the relevant issue for those traveling by ship.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ካቢን ዝርከበሉ ቦታ (Cabin reservation):**  The text doesn't mention anything about needing a cabin reservation.
* **C: እቲ ውዕላት (The documents):** While documents might be needed, the core issue is the visa.
* **D: ኣብ ከተማ ዘሕለፍዎ መጠን ግዜ (The amount of time spent in the city):**  The duration of stay doesn't seem to be the problem; it's the lack of a visa.

The passage states that passengers of the ship voyage in Saint Petersburg do not need a visa to enter the city. It then goes on to say that if they are not staying in a hotel (implying they are traveling without pre-arranged accommodation), they need to find a solution. Option A, "" ኣብ ከተማ ዝሓልፍ ግዜ"" (in the city), best captures the implication that they might be able to manage their time within the city itself without needing a hotel, thus addressing the need to ""ድሕኑ"" (manage/cope).

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: ብበረድ ምሕላፍ** (By traveling by land): The passage doesn't discuss land travel as an alternative.
* **C: ናይ ቪዛ ረቛሒታት** (Visa requirements): The passage mentions that passengers don't need a visa to enter Saint Petersburg, so this isn't a problem they face.
* **D: ሴንት ፒተርስበርግ** (Saint Petersburg): While the voyage is *in* Saint Petersburg, this doesn't answer the question of what they can do if they aren't staying in a hotel.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ብሕጊ ከም ፍሉጥ ናይ መጀመርያ ቋንቋኦም ተጌሩ ዝተተሓዘ ስለዝኾነ ኩሎም ምልክታት ብካታላን ይስየሙ (Because it was established by law as the primary official language, all signs are in Catalan).""

This directly supports option B. While Catalan is widely spoken and used in many contexts, its legal status as the primary official language is the key reason for its consistent use in signage and education.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ካብ ስጳንኛ ንላዕሊ ብሰፊሑ ስለ ዝርዳእ (Because it is used more widely than Spanish):** While Catalan is widely used, the passage says Spanish is used in the metro system. It doesn't state it is used more widely *than* Spanish overall.
*   **C: ኣብ ባርሴሎና ተመራጺ ቋንቋ ስለ ዝኾነ (Because it was the language that arrived in Barcelona):** This is not supported by the passage. It states that it was established by law as the official language.

The legal status is the core reason.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that comfortable hotels prioritize **the combination of a good room *and* a good breakfast**. It also highlights historical and cultural elements like traditional architecture, massage areas, and historical buildings.

Fast Wi-Fi, while a desirable amenity in modern hotels, is not mentioned as a key element contributing to a *comfortable* experience in the context described. The passage focuses on ambiance, historical significance, and the quality of the room and breakfast.  The other options (unique dining, historical building, and a well-located space) align with the qualities the passage deems important for a comfortable hotel stay.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that traditional restaurants with comfortable seating are a popular trend in developed countries.  It specifically mentions that the *opposite* of this trend is restaurants with old, poorly-maintained decor. Therefore, modern decor would be a significant differentiating factor *against* the comfort and traditional atmosphere that are key to the popularity of these restaurants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዝተፈላለዩ ወቕታዊ ቁርሲ ምቕራብ (Various modern chair designs):**  The passage explicitly states that chairs and tables are a key element of the restaurant experience.  Modern chair designs would be a defining characteristic of a *modern* restaurant.
* **C: ላዕለዋይ ደረጃ ዓራት (Superior-level tables):** The passage mentions tables are part of the service and the atmosphere. While quality tables are important, the text doesn't highlight them as a major differentiator *against* comfort.
* **D: ካብ ውሽጢ ዓዲ ዝመጽእ መግብን መስተን (Local food and tableware):** The passage mentions that the cuisine can be a reflection of the local area and mentions historical buildings. Local food and tableware would contribute to a unique atmosphere, aligning with the traditional aspect, not being a point of contention against comfort.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ቤይጂንግ መኽፈትን መዛዘሚ ምድላዋት ሓዊሱ ናይ ውሽጢ ገዛ ጸዋታታት በረድ ክትእንግድ እያ። ኻልእ ናይ በረድ ምንሽርታት ፀዋታታት ፀዋታታት ኣብ ኸባቢ ታይዚቼንግ ስኪ ኣብ ዝሃንግጂያኮው ይካየዱ...""

This translates to: ""Beijing hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor events. Other skiing events took place in the vicinity of Taiyicheng Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou...""

Therefore, the text clarifies that the opening and closing ceremonies, indoor events, and *other* skiing events (held at Taiyicheng) took place in Beijing.  The Taiyicheng Ski area events weren't held *in* Beijing; they were held *near* Beijing in Zhangjiakou.

The text explicitly states that Beijing is the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics, and that the 2022 event will be the Winter Olympics.  Therefore, the Winter Olympics are being hosted in Beijing.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ውሽጢ ገዛ ዝካየዱ ጸዋታታት በረድ (Indoor ice sports)**: The text mentions ice sports will be held in Zhangjiakou, not Beijing.
* **C: ናይ ክራማት ኦሎምፒካት (The Summer Olympics)**:  While Beijing has hosted the Summer Olympics, the question is specifically about what's being held in 2022.
* **D: እቲ ናይ መዛዘሚ ምድላዋት (The opening ceremonies)**: The text mentions the opening and closing ceremonies, but doesn't say they're *being held* in 2022. It says they *happen* in Beijing.

    * ""So far, only a few deaths have been recorded among humans out of a limited number of cases.""
    * ""Although most of them are associated with people involved in breeding, there is a shortage of sphecess.""

* **Why C is correct:** The text explicitly mentions ""ንሓለውቲ ኣዕዋፍ ጉድኣት አለዎ እዩ"" which translates to ""there is a shortage of sphecess"" and implies they are at risk. Option C directly reflects this.

Here's why:

* The passage states that immigration officers usually check passports after arriving by plane, ship, or other vehicle.

However, if you were to travel north of the equator in the ""lively tropics"" of Ecuador, you would have to face all kinds of scorching sun and rainy clouds (where the sky is cloudy and the rain is sometimes heavy).""

* **Analysis:** The passage contrasts Singapore's pleasant climate with the challenges of the Ecuadorian tropics. It specifically mentions ""raindew clouds (where the sky is cloudy and the rain is sometimes heavy).""  This aligns with the option of frequent heavy rainfall.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: ናይ ምዝማት ተኽእሎ (Potential for drought):** The passage emphasizes *rain*, not drought.
* **B: ድኳናት ዘይምርካብ (Lack of clouds):** The passage mentions *cloudy* skies and rain.

This translates to: ""German pastries are particularly good in Bavaria... many German pastries as well as nuts, hazelnuts and other fruits... fruit tart is especially harmonious with strong coffee... if you like it with cake, try in the Berlin area, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.""

The question asks what prevents someone from eating German pastries. The most likely reason, given the prominent mention of nuts (ለውዝ), is a nut allergy (ከቢድ ኣለርጂ ለውዝ ዘለዎ ሰብ).

The other options are less likely:

*   **B: ዝማዕበለ ምቁር መግቢ ዝመርጽ ሰብ (Someone who chooses a delicious main course)** - This doesn't prevent someone from eating pastries.
*   **C: ቸኮሌት ዘይፈቱ ሰብ (Someone who doesn't eat chocolate)** - While some pastries might contain chocolate, it's not the primary reason someone would avoid German pastries.
*   **D: ካብ ጥዑም መኣዛታት ንምቁር መኣዛታት ዝመርጽ ሰብ (Someone who chooses appetizers instead of main courses)** - This doesn't prevent someone from eating pastries.

ኣየናይ ቀመም እዩ ከም ወቕታዊ ባእታ ናይ ጀርመን መሰንከቲ ባኒ ዝቑጸር?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣፕል (Apple)**.

The text explicitly states: ""ቱፋሕ ዓመት ሙሉእ ምስ ቅጫ ተሓዊሱ ምስርሑ..."" which translates to ""Apples are harvested from autumn until winter..."" and is a very prominent German baked good ingredient.

ካብቲ ጥቕሲ መሰረት ብምግባር፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ብባጀት ንምጉዓዝ ዝምከር ምኽሪ ክኸውን ዘይክእል?,"The correct answer is **C: ንሰባት ገንዘብ ምሕታት (Giving money to people)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that budget travel *does not* involve harming or taking advantage of others. Giving money to people, without knowing their circumstances, could potentially be harmful or create dependency, thus violating the ethical principles of budget travel as outlined in the text.

Let's look at why the other options *could* be part of a budget trip:

* **A: ኣብ እዋን መገሻታትኩም ክትገብሩዎም እትኽእሉ ፍሉይ ስራሕ ድለዩ (Find unique jobs during your travels):** This is a common way to earn money to fund a budget trip.
* **B: ምስ ደረጃ ምቾትካ ተዓጻጻፊ ምዃን (Being adaptable to your level of comfort):** Budget travel requires flexibility and the ability to adjust plans based on budget constraints.
* **D: ከም መግብን መንበሪን ዝኣመሰሉ ወጻኢታት ምንካይ (Traveling to places like restaurants and libraries):** These are generally affordable activities and can be part of a budget travel itinerary.



Therefore, option C is the only one that directly contradicts the ethical guidelines presented for budget travel in the text."
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ መን እዩ ብኣዝዩ ዝተሓተ ባጀት ንምጉዓዝ ክጽገም ዝኽእል?,"The correct answer is **A: ብድሆ ብሓጎስ ዝቕበል ሰብ (A person who is willing to be frugal)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the path described is for ""ፍቓደኛታት ዝኾኑ ሰባት፡ ነቲ ብዝተሓተ በጀት ዝግበር ጉዕዞ ክሪኡ ኣለዎ"" (people who are willing, therefore they should embark on a journey that is undertaken with a limited budget).  Being ""ብድሆ ብሓጎስ ዝቕበል"" (willing to be frugal) aligns perfectly with the concept of a limited budget.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ጽኑዕ ናይ ግዜ ደረት ዘይብሉ ሰብ (A person who is not strict with time):** The text emphasizes budget limitations, not flexibility with time.
* **C: ኣብ ጉዕዞ እንከሎ ብርሑቕ ክሰርሕ ዝሓሰበ ሰብ (A person who has planned to work sparsely during the journey):** While this might be *one* aspect of a frugal journey, the text's focus is more on overall budgetary constraints.
* **D: ናይ መገሻ መደብ ምኽታል ባህ ዘብሎ ሰብ (A person who has the habit of saving money):** While saving money is related to frugality, the text specifically focuses on *limited budget journeys*, which implies more than just saving. Willingness to be frugal, even if not necessarily a strong saver, is the more direct fit.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ናይ ሞባይል ስልኪ ግልጋሎት ካብ ኻልኦት ብዙሓት መገድታት ንላዕሊ ኣብዚ ኣዝዩ ጥንኩር እዩ، ንኣብነት ናይ ፔኒሲልቬኒያ ዱር (Mobile signal strength is exceptionally weak on this highway compared to many other roads, for example, the Pennsylvania Turnpike).""

Option D directly contradicts this statement. The other options are all mentioned or implied in the text.

Here's why: The passage states that the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is known for its frequent refueling stops and heavy traffic. However, a surprising aspect is the excellent mobile signal coverage, which is better than many other highways. It also mentions that refueling stops are less frequent compared to other highways.

Options A, B, and D are incorrect because:

*   **A: ኣብ ብርቱዕ ትራፊክ ምዕጻው (Heavy traffic jams):** While the highway *is* known for heavy traffic, the passage highlights the surprising *lack* of frequent refueling stops.
*   **B: እኹል ኣገልግሎት ሞባይል ዘይምህላው (Poor mobile service):** The passage explicitly states the *opposite* – excellent mobile signal coverage.
*   **D: ብተደጋጋሚ ናይ ጽርግያ ስራሕቲ እንተጋጢሙ (Frequent tire repairs):** The passage doesn't mention tire repairs as a key characteristic of the highway.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ብማይ ዘለዎ ውሽጢ ጎቦ ምንስፋፍ ንምጅማር ዘየድሊ?,"The correct answer is **D: ንእሽቶ ልምምድ (Little experience)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that navigating whitewater requires *extensive training or significant physical fitness*.  

* **A: ናይ ምሕንባስ ዓቕሚ (Swimming ability):**  Necessary for whitewater.
* **B: ዝለዓለ ደረጃ ኣካላዊ ኩነታት (High level of physical condition):**  Essential for navigating the challenging currents.
* **C: ናይ ምዝላል ዓቕሚ (Ability to rescue):** Important for safety in whitewater.
* **D: ንእሽቶ ልምምድ (Little experience):** The passage explicitly says that *extensive* training is needed. Little experience would hinder, not facilitate, navigation.



Therefore, lack of experience is the one option that directly contradicts the passage's description of what's required for whitewater navigation."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ንዕዉት ዑደት ብማይ ዘለዎ ውሽጢ ጎቦ ምንስፋፍ ኣድላዪ ክኸውን ዝኽእል?,"The correct answer is **B: ኣብ ናይ ስኩባ ዳይቪንግ ዝጸንሐ ተመኩሮ (Experience in scuba diving)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that freediving (ብማይ ዘለዎ ውሽጢ ጎቦ ምንስፋፍ) involves techniques like breath-holding, relaxation, and mental discipline.  It also mentions that advanced freediving requires specific training or physical conditioning (like caves or Alps expeditions).

Scuba diving experience directly relates to breath-holding and comfort in underwater environments.  This is a crucial skill for freediving.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ምዕቡል ኣትሌቲካዊ ዓቕሚ (Athletic physical fitness):** While fitness is helpful, it's not the *primary* skill needed for freediving.  Breath-holding is more critical.
* **C: ናይ ብማይ ዘለዎ ውሽጢ ጎቦ ምንስፋፍ ዝተዋህበ ምስክር ወረቐት (Freediving certification):**  Certification demonstrates knowledge and adherence to safety procedures, but it doesn't *give* you the ability to freedive effectively.
* **D: ናይ ምሕንባስ ክእለት (Breath-holding ability):** Breath-holding is *essential*, but the passage implies advanced freediving requires *more* than just breath-holding.  It requires relaxation and mental discipline to manage the urge to breathe.

Therefore, scuba diving experience, with its emphasis on breath-holding and underwater comfort, is the most relevant option.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the importance of knowing your car's size when parking in tight spaces.** It specifically mentions that reversing can be helpful but requires careful attention.  Knowing the precise dimensions allows for more accurate maneuvering and reduces the risk of hitting something.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኮፍ መበሊታት ንኽድቅሱ ዝፍቅድ መኪና (A car that allows you to fold down the headrests):** Headrest folding is irrelevant to parking.
* **C: ዳስ (A basement):**  A basement is a parking *location*, not a car *feature*.
* **D: ክትዓድሩሉ እትኽእሉ ናይ ውልቀ ንብረት (A piece of real estate that you can maneuver):**  This is too broad and doesn't directly address the car's size.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that if you want to avoid being targeted by speed cameras, you should drive larger vehicles like SUVs or minivans.  Smaller cars are more likely to attract attention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ነዊሕ ናይ ጽርግያ ጉዕዞ ምግባር (Taking safe, prolonged journeys):** While safe driving is always important, the passage doesn't connect prolonged journeys directly to avoiding speed cameras.
* **C: ኣብ ከተማ ወይ ኣብ ናይ ብሕቲ ንብረት ዳስ ምትካል (In urban areas or in areas with high property value):**  The passage suggests speed cameras are more likely in these areas, but it doesn't say driving a particular type of vehicle will negate that risk. It's the *type of vehicle* that matters.
* **D: ምስ’ታ ዝጥቀሙላ ዘለዉ መኪና ምልላይ ኣጸቢቕኹም ዘይምፍላጥ (Not being distracted while driving a car with tinted windows):**  Tinted windows are mentioned in the context of potentially attracting attention, but the passage doesn't link *not* being distracted with avoiding speed cameras.

The text states: ""ናይ ሞሮኮ ሱልጣን ነታ ከተማ ዳሩ ኤል-ባድያ ብምባል ዳግማይ ሃኒጽዋ..."" which translates to ""The Moroccan Sultan renamed the city Dar el-Badia...""

The text explicitly states that Sintra became a popular destination for foreign visitors *after* Lord Byron returned and gave it enthusiastic praise. The other options are mentioned as attractions *within* Sintra, but the text directly links the rise in popularity to Byron's positive reviews.
"

The question asks what Armenia *didn't* accept. The passage states that Armenia, despite establishing a new republic through the Armenian Bank, did *not* recognize the independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
"

Here's why:

The passage states: "" ኣብቲ ክልል ዘሎ ዲፕሎማስያዊ ክርክራት ነቲ ኣብ ሞንጎ ኣርመኒያን ኣዛርባጃንን ዝነበረ ርክብ ኣበላሽይዎ。"" This translates to ""The diplomatic efforts in the region spoiled the relationship between Armenians and Azerbaijan.""

Therefore, diplomatic efforts are what spoiled the relationship. The other options are related to the conflict, but not the *cause* of the spoiled relationship mentioned in the text."

The text states that taxis in Charlotte charge extra for more than 2 passengers. Option B directly reflects this information. The other options are not mentioned as reasons for extra charges.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ኣብ ሻርሎት ምስ ቆልዑ ምንባር እንታይ ከም ጐድኒ ክውሰድ ይኽእል?,"The correct answer is **A: ዋጋታት መንበሪ ኣባይቲ (Home library prices)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Charlotte library is a strong point because it's well-equipped for families. It highlights that many families moved *to* Charlotte because of the library's resources and its role in supporting children's literacy. The passage also mentions the library's reach in the Uptown Charlotte area.

The key takeaway is that the library *supports families*, and one way it does this is by providing resources that are accessible and affordable. While the passage mentions taxi issues, it doesn't directly link that to supporting families or children's literacy. Option C about people moving from other areas is a *result* of the library's strength, not a *way to help* families *while traveling*. Option D about the city's growth isn't directly relevant to how families can benefit.

Therefore, the best answer connecting to the passage is the library's affordability and accessibility, which is reflected in the prices of its home library resources.

Therefore, the Araucanians controlled the northern part of Chile before the Spanish.

Here's why:

* The text states that Chile declared independence in 1810 but *didn't* achieve a decisive victory against the Spanish until 1818. 
* Therefore, achieving independence in 1810 is not what happened.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: ምምሕዳር መንግስቲ ዘይምህላው ነይሩ (The government was ineffective):** The text mentions the ineffective Spanish government due to the Napoleonic Wars.
* **B: ቺሊ ኣብ ልዕሊ ስጳኛውያን ዓወት ኣመዝጊባ (Chile achieved victory over the Spaniards):** The text states that Chile didn't achieve a decisive victory until 1818.
* **C: ውግኣት ናፖሊዮን ይካየዱ ነይሮም (The Napoleonic Wars were occurring):** The text explicitly mentions the Napoleonic Wars as a reason for the Spanish government's instability.

Here's why:

* The text states that the villages of Cinque Terre are not accessible by car. It specifically mentions that cars are not allowed on the roads there.
* The text also mentions the existence of trains as a mode of transportation connecting the villages.

Therefore, the only viable options are car and train.

The text specifically states: ""ሶላ ናይ ገሊኦም ቡትስ ሓርፋፍ ክኸሎ ከሎ, ሸታሕታሕ ኣብ ዘለዎ ኩነታት, ምስ መብዛሕቲኦም ዓይነታት ጫማን ቡትስን ዝሰማማዕ, ኣብ'ቲ ታኮ ጥራሕ ወይ'ውን ታኮን ሶላን ዝግበር ተወሳኺ መሐርፈፊ መሳርሒ ኣሎ (While the sole of many boots is smooth, in situations of slipperiness, in addition to the heel, treads can be applied to the sole).""

This directly addresses the need for boots with extra treads to handle slippery conditions like those experienced in winter. The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: ጸቢብ ብራኸ ወይ ሂል ዘለዎ ጫማ (Smooth leather or suede boots):** These would be *more* slippery, not better suited for winter conditions.
* **C: ልዑል ብርኪ ወይ ሂል ዘለዎ ጫማ (High heel or leather boots):** High heels and leather soles are generally poor choices for icy or snowy conditions.
* **D: 1/5 ኢንች ዕምቆት ዘለዎ ቅርጺ ዘይብሉ ጫማ (Boots with a depth of 1/5 inch without a tread pattern):** The text emphasizes the *need* for tread patterns for slipperiness. A shallow, smooth sole would not provide adequate grip.

Here's why:

The text states that salt, sand, and gravel can be used to improve traction on icy surfaces. Water, however, would make the surface *more* slippery, not less. 

Therefore, water is the only option that doesn't aid in reducing slippage on ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ክልቲኦም ብዙሓት ዓበይቲ ሆቴላት ኣለዎም (Both have many luxury hotels):** The passage mentions the absence of luxury hotels in the past. It doesn't state that they *currently* have many.
* **B: ክልቲኦም መንግስታዊነት የብሎምን (Both are not governmental):** The passage doesn't mention the governmental status of either Hawaii or the Cook Islands.
* **D: ክልቲኦም ከተማታት የብሎምን (Both do not have cities):** The passage states that the Cook Islands don't have cities, but it doesn't mention the city status of Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: ካብ ሃዋይ ዝነኣሰት እያ** (It is descended from Hawaii): The passage says they are considered ""Hawaii below"" due to the similar time zone.
* **B: ሕብረ-ደሴት (ኣርኪፔላጎ) እየን** (It is an archipelago): The passage directly states ""እ እምበር ካብ 15 ዝተፈላለያ ደሴታት ዝተኣከባ እየን"" (But I have been visiting from 15 different islands), which means it is an archipelago.
* **D: እታ ደሴታዊት ሃገር ምስ ሃዋይ ተመሳሳሊ ናይ ሰዓት ዞን እዮም ዝጥቀሙ** (That island nation uses the same time zone as Hawaii): The passage clearly states this.

This description aligns with backcountry skiing (ምሕዃር ጎቦ), where skiers travel off-piste and require sturdy skis and boots for traversing varied and often challenging terrain. The text contrasts this with resort skiing, which is more easily done with a car and equipment.

Here's why:

The passage states that people who want to achieve high speeds in skiing use skis and boots that are ""ብጣዕሚ ዘጣብቁ"" (well-fitting) and are designed for hard snow.  The passage contrasts this with ski touring or backcountry skiing, which are more about traversing difficult terrain with lighter equipment.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the challenges of cultural adaptation.** It highlights how ingrained cultural norms are and how difficult it can be to reconcile them with new cultural practices, especially after living abroad.
* **The question asks what returning immigrants should do if they experience a conflict between their original culture and the culture of the country they returned to.**
* **Option A directly addresses this conflict by suggesting adaptation.** The text implicitly suggests that adaptation is key to navigating these cultural clashes and maintaining a peaceful existence.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: ትዕግስተኛን ዝርዳእን ምዃን (Being patient and understanding):** While patience and understanding are helpful, they are *approaches* to adaptation, not the primary action itself.
* **C: ናብ ወጻኢ ሃገራት ምጉዓዝ (Emigrating to foreign countries):** This is the opposite of the situation described in the question – they are *returning* from a foreign country.
* **D: ምስ ባህሊ ዓዶም ዳግማይ ምልማድ (Re-adapting to the culture of the homeland):** This is a subset of option A.  Re-adapting to the homeland *requires* adapting to the changes that may have occurred in the homeland during their absence.


Therefore, **A** is the most comprehensive and accurate answer based on the provided text.

Here's why:

* The passage states that those who adapt to new cultures while living abroad are more likely to have a persistent and intense ""nay mera mizninnay birki"" (a type of emotional/psychological strain). 
* The passage specifically mentions that these individuals may find it very difficult to revert to their homeland's traditions and may even lose some of their original cultural habits after returning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብፍላይ ሕማቕ ባህላዊ ድንጋጸ ዘጋጠሞም ተጓዓዝቲ (Adaptable who have particularly strong traditional values):** The passage suggests *less* traditional values might make adaptation *easier*, not harder.
* **C: ገና ኣብ ብርኪ ሕጽኖት ዘለዉ ተጓዓዝቲ (Adaptable who are still under the influence of ""birki"" constraints):** The passage implies that those *already* in the process of adapting are the ones facing difficulties.
* **D: ውሑድ ትዕግስቲ ዘለዎም ተጓዓዝቲ (Adaptable who lack patience):**  The passage highlights that those returning home *need* patience and foresight, suggesting that a lack of patience isn't the core issue.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ሰባት ምስ ሙስ ካብ ምግባር ክቑጠቡዎ ዘለዎም ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ኣዝዩ ቀስ ኢልካ ምቕራብ (Approaching very slowly)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that moose are not naturally aggressive but become dangerous when threatened or provoked.  

* **A: ህላወኦም ሸለል ብምባል (Acting timidly)** -  This is likely a *good* approach.  Remaining calm and avoiding sudden movements would reduce the likelihood of provoking the moose.

* **B: ኣዝዩ ቀስ ኢልካ ምቕራብ (Approaching very slowly)** - This is **incorrect**. While slow movements are generally recommended around wildlife, a very slow, deliberate approach *could* still be perceived as a threat, especially if the moose is already alert. It doesn't guarantee safety and could still startle the moose.

* **C: ክህልዎም ዝኽእል ደረጃ ስግኣት ምንካይ (Maintaining a safe distance)** - This is correct. Keeping a distance is the best way to avoid provoking a moose.

* **D: ካብ ርሑቕ ምዕዛብ (Avoiding sudden movements)** - This is also correct. Sudden movements will scare the moose and could trigger a defensive response.



Therefore, approaching very slowly (B) is the *least* advisable option among those presented.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ሙስ (ኤልክ እናተብሃለ እውን ይፅዋዕ) ብተፈጥሮ ቁጡዕ ኣይኮነን"" which translates to ""Moose (even though they are called Elk) are not naturally aggressive."" 

Therefore, option A directly contradicts the information provided in the text. The other options are consistent with the text's description of moose behavior.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** "" እንተደኣ እቲ ተጓዓዛይ ነቲ ዋርዋርታ ስዒብዎ፣ ብቐሊל ዘይርከብ ሓይልን ዝተረፈ ማይን ብምብኻን ሓደገኛ ክኸውን ይኽእል እዩ።""  This translates to ""If the traveler tries to cross the waterfall, it can become dangerous by using little strength and being swept away by the flowing water.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ኣብ ዝሑል ለይቲ ውዑይ ክዳን ዘይምህላው (A: Failing to put on thick clothing in cold, low-lying areas.):**  The passage mentions cold, low-lying areas and the importance of thick clothing, but it doesn't directly state that *failing* to put it on is a *dangerous* act. It states that not discarding warm clothing is a danger.
* **B: ማይ ዋርዋርታ ከም ዝህልወካ ዝገብር መስትያት ምርኣይ (B: Looking for a crossing point where the waterfall has receded.):** While looking for a safe crossing point is prudent, the passage doesn't label the act of *looking* as dangerous.
* **C: ንሓደ ዋርዋርታ እናተኸታተልካ ጸዓት ምብኻን (C: Trying to cross a waterfall while following one.):** This is similar to D, and also dangerous, but D is more direct and explicitly mentioned in the text.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer based on the given passage.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions **water scarcity (ዋርዋርታ)** and **dehydration (ውሑድ መቐተ-ሰብነት)** as dangers in hot weather that can lead to problems for travelers. 
* **Sunburn (ጸሓይ ምንዳድ)** is a risk in hot weather, but it's not directly linked to the passage's warning about the dangers of water scarcity and dehydration causing a traveler to be unable to move or becoming dangerous. 

Therefore, sunburn is the only option not explicitly mentioned as a potential hazard in the passage."

The text also mentions: "" ኣብ ፍሬይ ባርቶሎሚ ዴ ላ ካሳስ(ትራታዶ ዴ ላ ኢንድያስ) ብምምርኳስ፣ ኣብ መንጎ 1492ን 1498ን እቶም ስጳኛዊ ገዛእቲ ንኣስታት 100,000 ቴይኖስ ቀቲሎም።"" which translates to: ""Thanks to Frey Bartolomé de las Casas (Treaty of the Indies), between 1492 and 1498, the Spanish rulers killed approximately 100,000 Taíno.""

Therefore, the Taíno population was heavily impacted, both through enslavement and through killings.

The text states: ""ካሪቤ ኣራውካን ዝዛረቡ ኣህዛብ ኮይኖም ኣብ ከባቢ 10,000B.C.E. መጺኦም።"" which translates to ""The Arawakan-speaking people came to the Caribbean around 10,000 B.C.E.""

The text states: "" ኣብ 1861 ድማ ናይ መዘናግዒ ስኪዪንግ ክለብ ብኖርዌጃውያን ኣብ ኣውስትራሊያ ተኸፊቱ"" which translates to ""In 1861, the first modern skiing club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.""

Therefore, Norwegians are credited with establishing modern skiing as a sport. While the text mentions Australia, it's the Norwegians who initiated the modern club. ""Ski Bams"" (Ski Jump) is a type of skiing, not a person. ""Teqamato Beati"" (Gathering of Ancient People) is too general.

Here's why:

* The passage states that many of the islands are either under French administration or have been historically colonized by France.  This means they *lack* independence.
* Options A, B, and C are all mentioned as characteristics of the islands in the passage.

Therefore, the only characteristic the islands *don't* share is independence from other countries.

Option D directly addresses the passport validity requirement mentioned in the text.  The other options are not accurately reflected in the provided excerpt.

Here's why:

The passage states that eye examinations, especially when done with insurance, can have higher costs when conducted abroad compared to within the country. The passage mentions ""ናይ ላዕልዋይ ብርኪ ናይ ቅርንጫፍ ሽማት መግለጺ"" (high branch fee description), implying that eye exams can trigger these higher fees. The other options are less directly linked to the passage's emphasis on increased costs related to international procedures.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are less likely:

* **B: ላዕለዋይ ደረጃ ዘለዎም ፍሬማት (High-end frames):** While expensive, the passage focuses on the *procedure* of the examination itself being more costly abroad.
* **C: ናይ ምርኣይ ኢንሹረንስ (Vision insurance):** The passage mentions insurance, but it's in the context of eye examinations potentially costing more when *with* insurance abroad.
* **D: ምልክት ንግዲ ዘይኮኑ ፍሬማት (Frames without markings):** This option doesn't directly relate to cost differences between domestic and international procedures.

Here's why:

The passage states that workers in industries like mining, especially those working underground in wealthier countries, may have issues with their eyesight. It mentions that if they have insurance and bring their medical records, they might encounter higher-level branch examination warnings. These warnings can be related to pre-existing conditions or conditions brought from abroad.

Therefore, a further eye examination is a likely consequence of these situations.  The other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   **B: እቲ ትእዛዝ መድሃኒት ንገለ ፍሬማት ቅኑዕ ክኸውን ኣይክእልን እዩ (The medication order may not be suitable for some frames)** - While possible, this isn't the primary concern highlighted in the passage.
*   **C: ናይ ሓሶት ክኾኑ ይኽእሉ እዮም (They may be of poor quality)** - The passage doesn't focus on the quality of frames.
*   **D: ኢንሹረንስ ነቲ ወጻኢታት ዘይክሽፍኖ ይኽእል እዩ (Insurance may not cover the overseas workers)** - While insurance issues *could* arise, the passage primarily discusses eye-related problems resulting from the work environment.

(Currency exchange is not possible outside the Falkland Islands, so currency should be exchanged before leaving the islands.) This implies that British Pounds are widely accepted when leaving the islands.

* **A: ኣብተን ኣብ ርሑቕ ዝርከባ ደሴታት ክረዲት ካርድን ፓውንድ ብሪጣንያን ጥራይ እዩ ዝቕበል** (Only accepts credit cards and British pounds in the remote islands): The text mentions Stanley accepts US dollars, so this is false.
* **B: ስታንሊ ጥራይ እያ ንዶላር ኣመሪካ እትቕበል** (Stanley only accepts American dollars): The text states Stanley accepts *both* Stanley credit cards *and* American dollars.
* **C: ካብተን ደሴታት ምስ ወጻእካ ፓውንድ ፎክላንድ ክለዋወጥ ኣለዎ** (Must exchange Falkland pounds when leaving the islands): The text says currency exchange is *not* possible outside the Falkland Islands, implying you don't *have* to exchange Falkland pounds when leaving,"

This directly indicates that F&C West is a place where currency exchange is possible. The text also clarifies that credit cards aren't always accepted outside of Stanley. Therefore, exchanging currency at F&C West is a viable alternative to credit cards for someone traveling from America to the Falklands.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኣብ መላእ ኩለን ደሴታት (In all the islands):** The text says credit cards aren't *always* accepted across all islands.
*   **C: ኣብተን ወጻኢ ዝርከባ ደሴታት (In the outer islands):** The text states that Falkland money isn't accepted in the outer islands, so currency exchange there wouldn't be useful.
*   **D: ኣብ መላእ ስታንሊ (In all of Stanley):** While F&C West is *in* Stanley, the text doesn't say that *all* currency exchange is possible everywhere in Stanley. It specifically mentions F&C West.

The text explicitly states that most temple festivals celebrate annual events *excluding* the birth ceremony. It lists annual temple festivals, patriarch festivals, and other significant temple-related events as being celebrated. Therefore, the birth ceremony is the exception.

The passage states: ""ናይ ኬራላን ናይ ቤተ መቕደስ በዓላት ኣዝዮም መሐጎስቲ እዮም፣ ብምዱብ ሰልፊ ዘጌፁ ሓራምዝ፣ ናይ ቤተ መቕደስ ኦርኬስትራን ኻልኦት በዓላትን የካትት።""

This translates to: ""Kerala and temple festivals are very joyous, including decorated elephants in processions, temple orchestras, and other festivals.""

Therefore, the decorated elephants (ዘጌፁ ሓራምዝ) are seen **during temple festivals with processions ( ኣብ በዓላት ቤተ-መቕደስ ብምዱብ ሰልፊ)**.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: ካብ መወዳእታ ሕዳር ክሳብ መፋርቕ ግንቦት ኣብ ኩሉ ቦታታት (From late November to late May in all places):** While this is the time frame, it doesn't specify *where* the elephants are seen.
* **B: ኣብ ቤተ-መቕደስ (At the temple):**  The passage mentions processions, not just being *at* the temple.
* **D: ኣብ ጎደናታት ኬራላ (In the streets of Kerala):** The passage specifically says they are seen *at temple festivals*, not just in the streets of Kerala.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that taking direct routes between A and B doesn't increase business or first-class revenue.  It emphasizes that airlines are willing to let passengers choose routes for additional dollars.  

Finding a discount directly impacts the amount of money spent, thus increasing the profit margin for the company.  The other options are presented as ways to *increase the cost* for the airline, not directly increase the profit margin for the company.

The question asks what additional costs to consider when comparing the total price of a trip to Africa with a round-the-world trip. The passage explicitly states: "" ኣብ ኩሎም ካብ ኣፍሪቃ ወጻኢ ዝርከቡ ቦታታት، ተወሳኺ ዋጋታት ናይ ተወሰኽቲ ቪዛታት، ቀረጽ ናይ በረራ، መጓዕዝያ ባይታ ወ.ዘ.ተ. ኣብ ግምት ምእታው ኣይትረስዕ."" which translates to ""In all trips from Africa abroad, additional costs of visa fees for acceptors, airport taxes, baggage, etc. should be considered.""  Visa fees for destinations *outside* of Africa are a significant additional cost compared to a round-the-world trip that might include those same destinations.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: ኣብ ኣፍሪቃ ቀረጽ ናይ በረራ** (Airport taxes in Africa): While airport taxes are a cost, the passage mentions airport taxes in general as part of additional costs *from* Africa abroad, not specifically a cost *within* Africa.
* **C: ወጻኢታት ናይ ኣፍሪቃዊ ቪዛ** (Visa fees for African countries):  The passage focuses on visa fees *for destinations outside of Africa* as an additional cost when comparing to a round-the-world trip.
* **D: ካብ ኣፍሪቃ ወጻኢ ንዝርከቡ ቦታታት ናይ መሬት መጓዕዝያ ወጻኢታት** (Ground transportation abroad from Africa):  Ground transportation is a cost, but the passage doesn't highlight it as a *major additional* cost compared to the visa fees.

The passage states that due to a lack of space, supermarket food options are limited to pre-made meals.  The passage contrasts this with restaurants in some countries/stores that offer a wide variety of meals at good prices. It also mentions that many supermarkets offer prepared meal components. The question asks what supermarkets have started offering *more* of. Since they are limited by space and already offer pre-made meals, they are expanding on that by focusing on those options.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...in some countries or within supermarkets, a restaurant that offers good quality food with a variety of options is popular."" This directly connects restaurants located within supermarkets to meeting the needs of customers wanting convenient, ready-to-eat meals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ውሑድ ዝተፈላለየ ምርጫ (Limited variety):** The passage explicitly says supermarkets offer *limited* meal options due to lack of space.
* **C: ጥረ መግቢ (Dry meals):** While some supermarkets offer dry meals, the passage focuses on convenience and prepared meals.
* **D: ማይክሮዌቭ ኦቨን (Microwave oven):**  Some supermarkets offer microwaveable meals, but it's not a restaurant, and the passage emphasizes a broader offering than just microwaveable options.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ፈረንሳይኛ ብዝዛረቡ ቤልጅየማውያንን ስዊዝን ዘይርድእዎ?,"The correct answer is **D: ኣብ ፈረንሳይ ዝዝረብ መብዛሕትኡ ፈረንሳይኛ (Most of the French spoken in France)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while Belgians and Swiss French speakers learn French in school and understand the standard grammatical system and vocabulary, there are differences.  However, the key point is that the *majority* of French spoken in France is *different* from the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland due to these linguistic variations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ መደበኛ ስርዓተ ቁጽሪ ፈረንሳይኛ (The standard grammatical system of French):**  The passage explicitly says Belgians and Swiss French speakers *do* understand the standard grammatical system.
* **B: ፍሉይ ናይ ፈረንሳይኛ ቃላት (Specific French vocabulary):**  The passage mentions that there are differences in the vocabulary used in Belgium, Switzerland, and France.
* **C: ዝተወሰኑ ኣደማምጻታት ቃላት ፈረንሳይኛ (Certain pronunciations of French words):** The passage also mentions differences in pronunciation.



Therefore, the only option that represents a genuine difference between the French spoken in Belgium/Switzerland and the French spoken in France is the prevalence of French vocabulary and pronunciation in France.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ኣብ ፈረንሳይ ምስ ኣብ ቤልጅየም ወይ ስዊዘርላንድ ዘይመሳሰል?,"The correct answer is **A: ኣደማምጻ ናይ ኩሉ ቃላት (The pronunciation of all words)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""ብፍሉይ፣ ቁጽራዊ ስርዓት ኣብ ተዛረብቲ ፈረንሳኛ በልጁምን ስዊዘርላንድን ካብቲ ኣብ ፈረንሳ ዝዝረብ ፈረንሳኛ ገለ ንኣሽቱ ፍልልያት ኣለዎ, ከምኡ ድማ ኣደማምጻ ናይ ገለ ቃላት ቁሩብ ፍልይ ዝበለ እዩ."" (Uniquely, the phonetic system in speakers of French in Belgium and Switzerland has two differences from speakers of French in France, as well as a close difference in pronunciation of some words.)

* **The passage implies:** While the grammatical and written aspects of French are similar across these regions, the *pronunciation* is where the key differences lie.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: እቲ ስርዓተ ቁጽሪ (The phonetic system):** The passage explicitly mentions differences in the phonetic system.
* **C: ኣብ ቤት ትምህርቲ ዝወሃብ ስሩዕ ፈረንሳይኛ (The school French taught):**  The passage states that school French in Belgium and Switzerland *is* based on the French written system, implying similarity.
* **D: ኣጸሓሕፋ ፊደላት ናይ ገሊኡ ቃላት ፈረንሳይኛ (The spelling of some French words):**  The passage mentions similarity in written French and the usage of the French alphabet.



Therefore, the pronunciation of words is the most significant difference mentioned in the text compared to France.

Here's why:

The passage states that the service is offered by ""ውሑዳት ኣየር መንገድታት ጥራሕ"" (limited airlines only), specifically mentioning Air Canada, Delta, and Lufthansa, as well as WestJet. It also says you can contact Air Canada directly via phone.

Option B describes a scenario where you're using a third-party service to book a flight, rather than booking directly with Air Canada. This would likely disqualify you from receiving the bereavement fare service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብዌስትጀት ትበርር እንተኾይንካ (If you fly with WestJet):** The passage *does* mention WestJet as an airline that *can* offer the service.
* **C: ካብ ፓሪስ ናብ ኣመሪካ ብነፋሪት ሉፍታን ትበርር እንተኾይንካ (If you fly from Paris to America with a nighttime Lufthansa flight):**  The passage mentions Lufthansa as a possible airline, and this scenario doesn't inherently exclude the service.
* **D: ብዴልታ ትበርር እንተኾይንካ (If you fly with Delta):** The passage mentions Delta as a possible airline, and this scenario doesn't inherently exclude the service.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ውሑዳት ኣየር መንገድታት ጥራሕ እየን ናይ ሓዘን በረራ ኣገልግሎት ዘቕርባ፣ ነቲ ናይ መወዳእታ ሰዓት ናይ ቀብሪ ጉዕዞ ንእሽተይ ክፍሊቱ ብምቕናስ።"" This translates to: ""Only select airlines offer funeral flight services, covering the final hour of the funeral arrangements for a small portion of it by payment.""

Option C accurately reflects this, as it mentions the ""final hour"" (ናይ መወዳእታ ሰዓት) and the fact that the airline covers ""funeral arrangements"" (መገሻ ዝኸውን ወጻኢታት).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ናይ ቀብሪ ጉዕዞ ወጻኢታት ይሽፍኑ** (Funeral arrangements are covered): While funeral arrangements *are* part of the service, the text specifies it's for the *final hour* of those arrangements.
*   **B: ብቐጥታ ኣብ መርበብ ሓበሬታ ናይ እቲ መንገዲ ኣየር ትኬት ክቖርጹ ኣለዎም** (You can directly book tickets on the airline's information portal): The text states you can contact Air Canada directly by phone, not book tickets online.
*   **D: ብቐጥታ ምስቲ መንገዲ ኣየር ብስልኮም ትኬት ክቖርጹ ኣለዎም** (You can directly book tickets with the airline by phone): The text states you can contact Air Canada directly by phone, not book tickets by phone.

Here's why:

* The problem states the user has no money to buy a dedicated GPS device or map updates.
* The question asks when using the GPS app is *less* convenient than using a dedicated GPS device. 
* If the user needs to save money, using the free GPS app is more convenient than incurring the cost of a dedicated device or map updates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዳታ ኮነክሽን ከም ዝህልወካ ምስ ኣረጋገጽካ (When you have data connection with assurance):**  The problem mentions lack of data connection as a limitation of the app.
* **C: ካብ መስመር ወጻኢ እንተለኻ (When you are off-line):** The problem explicitly states the app doesn't function well or at all offline.
* **D: መሳርሒ ክትካረ ኣብ ዘይትደልየሉ እዋን (When you don't need a device):** The question isn't about needing a device, but about the convenience of the *app* versus a dedicated device.

Here's why:

The passage states that GPS trackers are useless when there is no data connection or when you are off-grid.  Option A directly reflects this problem. The other options are mentioned as difficulties related to GPS trackers, but not the core reason they are useless *without a data connection*."

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of selecting a knowledgeable and reliable travel agent.** This agent should understand the different types of ships and be able to match travelers with a suitable vessel.
* **The challenge is to secure a spot on a ship, especially since they fill up quickly.**
* **Option A directly addresses this challenge by suggesting a group booking.**  A larger group (8+) with similar interests is more likely to be accommodated and allows the travel agent to better negotiate with the ship.
* **The other options are less effective:**
    * **B: ኣብ ቈራሪ ወቕቲ ትኬት ምግዛእ (Buying tickets at the last minute)** is risky and likely to result in no availability.
    * **C: ምስ ሓደ ኣብ ጉዕዞ ጋላፖጎስ ፍሉይ ክእለት ዘለዎ ወኪል ትኬት ምግዛእ (Buying tickets with a travel agent who has special privileges in Galapagos)** is good, but a group booking (Option A) is a more proactive and reliable approach.
    * **D: ኣዝዩ ኣቐዲምካ ትኬት ምግዛእ (Buying tickets very early)** is generally advisable, but it doesn't specifically address the challenge of securing a spot on a full ship.



Therefore, **Option A is the best solution based on the information provided in the passage.**

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ እዩ ከም ሜላ ንኣጋይሽ ቁማር ንኽጻወቱ ዘይጥቀመሉ?,"The correct answer is **A: ብብዝሒ ተፈጥሮኣዊ ብርሃን (With abundant natural light)**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes casinos as places that can lead to financial ruin and addiction.** It emphasizes the importance of a positive atmosphere, good food, and entertainment to keep people engaged.
* **It specifically mentions the availability of alcohol.**
* **It highlights the danger of not having good self-control.**

Let's analyze each option:

* **A: ብብዝሒ ተፈጥሮኣዊ ብርሃን (With abundant natural light):** This is unrelated to the themes of addiction, financial risk, or the temptations present in a casino environment. It's a positive attribute, but not a mitigating factor against the downsides of gambling.
* **B: መተባብዒታት ከም ነጻ ናይ ኮንሰርት ትኬት (Promotions like free concert tickets):** Casinos use promotions and freebies to attract and keep gamblers engaged. This aligns with the text's description of the entertainment offered.
* **C: ናይ ናጻ መስተታት (Free drinks):**  The text explicitly mentions the availability of alcohol in casinos and how free drinks can contribute to a lack of self-control.
* **D: ሰዓታት ዘይምህላው (Lack of time):** This is a common excuse people use to justify gambling. The text focuses on the *temptations* within the casino, not the lack of time.

Therefore, ""ብብዝሒ ተፈጥሮኣዊ ብርሃን"" is the only option that isn't related to the factors that can lead to or mitigate the dangers of gambling as described in the text.

The passage states: ""ኩሎ ግዜ ብዓቢ/ካፒታል ፊደል እዮም ዝጅምሩ። ኣብ መንጎ ገለ ግሲታትን ነገራትን መፈላለዪ ዝኾነ ኣገዳሲ መንገዲ እዩ።"" which translates to ""They always begin with a capital letter. It is an important way to distinguish between one concept and another.""  The passage goes on to define ""Asmat"" as what the user means by ""Sie"" (which in Amharic is ""Asmat"").

Therefore, the passage directly links capital letters being used to denote ""Asmat"".

Here's why:

The passage states that in the context of lists and things, proper nouns (names) are distinguished by always starting with a capital letter. The passage then mentions that this distinction is often lost when writing informally. Therefore, the more names are written in capital letters, the greater the issue of lost distinction becomes.

The text states: "" ኣብ ማለዥያ ዋላ ብውሕዱ በቶም ኣብ ገጠር ማለዥያ ዝነብሩ ሰባት፣ ትርጉሙ “ናብዚ ንዓ” ማለት እዩ።"" (In rural Malaysia, a single hand gesture meant ""come here to me."")  The question asks for the physical gesture associated with ""come here to me"" in rural Malaysia.  The passage then mentions "" ኣመልካቲት ኣጻብዕቲ ምጥዋይ "" (Alamak hand gesture) as the meaning in rural areas. 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኢድ ምውዝዋዝ (Eid al-Fitr waving)** is the *action* of waving during Eid, not the gesture that *means* ""come here.""
*   **C: ኢድካ ኣልዒልካ ምስ ኢዱ ምግጫው (ሃይ-ፋይፍ) (Eid followed by a handshake)** is a greeting, not the ""come here"" gesture.
*   **D: ኣጻብዕቲ ኢድ ንላዕሊ ምሃብ (Raising Eid hands)** doesn't specifically indicate a ""come here"" meaning.

Here's why:

The text states that in rural areas, the gesture ""ናብዚ ንዓ"" (nabzi n'a) means ""come to me.""  It then connects this gesture to the tradition of offering gifts in the Middle East and contrasts it with how it might be interpreted by a Westerner as a ""goodbye"" or ""see you later.""  The text specifically mentions that this offering of gifts in the Middle East is a custom *unique* to them.

The hawk's head movement is presented as the physical action that could represent this ""come to me"" gesture within the context of the text, highlighting it as a unique local custom. The description of the hawk moving its head back and forth aligns with the explanation of the gesture being a welcoming one in the given context.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጨጉሪ ርእስኻ ንውሽጢ ገጹ እናወዛወዝካ (A hawk moving its head inward)** This isn't associated with a welcoming gesture.
*   **B: ኣመልካቲት ኣጻብዕቲ ምጥዋይ (A flickering candle flame)** This is a visual element, not a physical gesture.
*   **D: ርእስኻ እናነቕነቕካ (Shaking your head)** This usually signifies disagreement or refusal, not welcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ዘይርጉእ በረድ በዓቲ (Non-barbed wire beetles):** The passage doesn't mention non-barbed wire beetles. It focuses on beetles that *can* infest barbed wire.
*   **C: ዝፈርስ በዓትታት በረድ (Barbed wire-destroying beetles):** The passage states the beetles *can* damage the barbed wire, but doesn't explicitly say they destroy it. It mentions they can eat the wire and the staples.
*   **D: ልሕሉሕ ኹምራ ጫፍ በረድ (Thin barbed wire end):** While the passage mentions the beetles congregate at the end of the barbed wire, it doesn't define ""thin barbed wire end"" as the pests themselves.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ናይ በረድ ጥርቅም (ክምችት) ዝተረጋግኣ ኣይኮነን፣ ግን ካብቲ ጎቦ ይወርዱ እዮም። እዚ ኣብ ናይ በረድ ድልድል(ቢንቶ) ክድብዝዝ ዝኽእል ነቓዓት፣ ስንጣቓት የኸትል"" which translates to: ""The slime (mucus) is not settled, but it flows from the roots. This can clog the veins (arteries) of the fish, causing blockages and clots.""

Therefore, the passage directly indicates that slime (snṭiqot) is what can clog fish veins. The other options are incorrect:

* **Bዓቲ በረድ (B'ati Bered - Fish Scales):** While scales are part of a fish, the passage doesn't mention them clogging veins.
* **C መናድቕ (Menadiq - Liver):** The passage mentions the liver can be eaten by fish, but not that it clogs veins.
* **D ዓበይቲ ብሎኮታት (Abeyti Blokotat -  Black Bladder/Spleen):** Similar to the liver, the passage only states black bladders can be eaten, not that they clog veins.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that Goma is a volatile city bordering the Nyiragongo volcano and is affected by conflict in the northern region.  While the other options are geographically relevant, the information directly states the dangers are *around* Goma, not just within the city itself or in distant locations.  Travelers need to be cautious in the surrounding areas due to the volcano and ongoing conflict.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the cheap machete rebels from Rwanda used to exploit Goma for resources and as a base.  Therefore, suggesting Goma is a ""good place"" for them is *not* good advice for someone writing about Goma. It ignores the historical context of conflict and exploitation.

Let's look at why the other options *are* good advice (or at least factual):

* **A: ኣብ ሰሜን ኪቩ ዝካየድ ዘሎ ውግእ ኣዘናጋዒ እዩ (The war in the North Kivu region is dangerous):**  This is a factual statement presented in the text.
* **C: ሞተር ሳይክል ታክሲ ንኽትዛወር ጽቡቕ መገዲ እዩ (Motorcycle taxis are a good way to get around):** The text states this is a common mode of transportation, and gives a fare.
* **D: መሰረት እሳተ ጎመራ ኒራጎንጎ ኣብታ ከተማ እዩ ዝርከብ (The base of Rwanda's Inyaga is located in the city):** This is a historical fact mentioned in the text.

This translates to: ""Like the camps at Bright Angel in Phantom Ranch, these unique places are filled with opportunities at the very beginning of the season.

On any day of May, the permission of the backcountry country is opened, and on the 1st day it is closed.""

This translates to: ""Since there are limited spaces that address the questions of the hiker's journey, the first one to apply will be selected.""  This indicates a limited number of permits are available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቀዳማይ ዝመጸ ቀዳማይ ዝግልገለሉ ስርዓት ፍቓድ (First come, first served permit system):** While similar, the text emphasizes limited *spaces* rather than a purely first-come, first-served approach. The selection process considers the hiker's questions, which goes beyond simple arrival time.
* **B: ፍቓድ ኣብ 1 ጥሪ ጥራይ እዩ ዝወሃብ (Permits are only issued on the 1st):** The text mentions permits are available on the opening day of the season and on the first day of each month (when the concession opens), so this is not accurate.
* **C: ፍቓድ ብእግሪ ምእታው ብዝቐርብ ሕቶ ጥራይ እዩ ክርከብ ዝኽእል (Permits can only be obtained by answering questions related to the hiker's journey):** While answering questions is a factor, the text also highlights the limited number of spaces, making the limited permit aspect the core policy.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that these historic hotels were known for hosting *elite* people, often involving lavish meals, nighttime entertainment, and a sense of elegance. They were places where prominent figures (nation leaders, etc.) would gather.  The key point is the emphasis on social gatherings and a unique atmosphere.  Options A, B, and D are too specific and don't capture the overall essence of the hotel's historical function as described.  Option C, ""unique or distinctive social gatherings,"" directly aligns with this.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that these old hotels have a unique charm stemming from their historical significance and the atmosphere they cultivated in the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were places for the wealthy and fashionable, offering luxury, privacy, and excellent service.  The fact that they *owned* the entire property with ancient heritage is the foundation of that unique charm and historical value.  

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **B: ፍሉጥ ሼፍ ዘለዎ ቤት መግቢ (Having a talented chef restaurant):** While a good restaurant is desirable, it's not the defining characteristic of these hotels' historical prominence.
* **C: ናይ ምሸት መዘናግዒ ዝህብ ገዛ (A luxurious sleeping environment):**  Luxury beds are expected in any high-end hotel; they don't explain the hotel's unique historical character.

* **B: ገበን (Fishery):** The text mentions that Greenlanders don't fish in the same way people elsewhere do, but it doesn't say that non-Greenlanders shouldn't expect to find fisheries *at all*.
* **C: ኩነታት ኣየር (Weather Conditions):**  The text discusses Greenland's weather conditions extensively, outlining how to prepare for them. It doesn't say that non-Greenlanders shouldn't expect *any* weather conditions.
* **D: ደቂ እቲ ከባቢ (People of the Region):"

Therefore, the Templo de San Diego is the one that has been used as a central marketplace.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states that there's a restaurant near the garden that hosts concerts and ""ma'akelawi gazibo"" (which translates to ""central gazebo"" or ""gazebo-like structure"") after hours. 
* It also mentions the gazebo's romantic history.
* The text explicitly mentions that the *central gazebo* hosts concerts.
* And the *ancient monastery building* is identified as the ""Tempa San Diego"" building.

Therefore, the Atahil restaurant is the only option not directly mentioned as being part of the Jardin de la Union.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that day hiking is a *short* and *easy* workout, suitable for people with moderate fitness levels. It also mentions it's a feasible activity for parents with toddlers and preschoolers for a single day. Option D directly contradicts this by saying it's *not* comfortable for families with young children to achieve a leg workout.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ቀለልቲ መገድታት ናይ መዓልቲ ብእግሪ ምጉዓዝ ብዙሕ ምድላው የድሊ** (Day hiking on gentle paths provides a lot of exercise) - This aligns with the text, which says it's a short and easy workout.
* **B: ርሕቀት ይፈላለ እዩ፡ ግን ኣብ ውሽጢ ሓደ መዓልቲ ክሽፈን ተባሂሉ ዝተዳለወ እዩ** (The distance varies, but it is intended to be completed within one day) - This is also consistent with the text, which states it's a day hike, meaning it's completed within a day.
* **C: ማእከላይ ደረጃ ብቕዓት ዘለዎም ሰባት ብሓፈሻ ነዚ ንጥፈት እዚ ከስተማቕርዎ ይኽእሉ** (People with moderate fitness levels can generally relate to this activity) - This also aligns with the text, which says it's suitable for people with moderate fitness levels.

The passage explicitly states: "" ንቕልል ዝበለ ጉዕዞ ምሕዃר… እዩ"" which translates to ""Being a short journey, it is..."".  It also mentions a typical journey of ""ሓደ ማይል ክሳብ ኣብ ሓደ መዓልቲ ክሽፈን ዝኽእል"" - ""one mile to be finished in one day"". This indicates a shortened distance makes it a low-impact activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እቲ ተጓዓዛይ ኣካላዊ ብቕዓት ምስ ዝህልዎ (When the traveler has physical fitness):** While fitness helps, the passage emphasizes the *length* of the journey as a key factor in impact.
* **C: ህጻናት ናብቲ ንእግሪ ጉዕዞ ክኸዱ ከለዉ (When children go on a foot journey):** The passage mentions children can do it, but it's not the defining factor of low impact.
* **D: እቲ ምጉዓዝ ኣብ ዝያዳ ተፈጥሮኣዊ ሃዋህው ምስ ዝኸውን (When the journey is in a more natural environment):**  The passage doesn't connect the environment directly to the low-impact nature of the journey.

Here's why:

The passage describes the fjords of Norway as steep-sided valleys carved by glaciers. Rogaland and Agder, while having some plains, are characterized by plateaus that often slope downwards. This is a key difference from the overall landscape of Norway, which includes fjords, mountains, and some flatter areas.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ኣግራብ ኣለዎም (They have a lack of water):** While water availability can be a factor, the passage doesn't specifically highlight a lack of water as the primary differentiating factor.
* **B: ፍዮርድ የብሉን (They don't have fjords):** Rogaland and Agder *do* have some fjords, though they are not as dominant as in other parts of Norway. This isn't the main distinguishing feature.
* **D: መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ብሄዘር እዮም ዝሽፈኑ (They are mostly formed by erosion):** While erosion plays a role in shaping the landscape, the passage emphasizes the plateau structure and sloping terrain, making this answer less specific.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that ""fløytar"" are characterized by *dry* meadows and grasslands. 
* The term ""vidd"" describes vast, open, and often barren areas. 
* ""Hay"" refers to treeless land.
* While the other options (wildflowers, dry meadows, and open land) are all associated with ""fløytar"" and Norwegian landscapes, swamps are the *opposite* of what's described. The text focuses on dry, open areas, not areas prone to marshy conditions.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""እቲ ንበረኽቲ ቦታታት ናይ ጎብነይቲ ወቕቲ ኣብ ናይ ህንዲ ክረምቲ ይመረፅ። ኮይኑ ግን ፣ኣብ ሓጋይ እዋን በብዓይነቱ ዓይነት ፅባቀ ከምኡውን መልክዕ ኣለዎም..."" (Eti nberekti botatat nay gobneyti wqti ab nay Hindi kiremti yimerec.

However, during the rainy season, they have a similar appearance and are accompanied by a delightful fragrance of honey and the movement of the petals.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly links the blooming and fragrance to the rainy season (ሓጋይ እዋን).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ኮይኑ ግን ፣ኣብ ሓጋይ እዋን በብዓይነቱ ዓይነት ፅባቀ ከምኡውን መልክዕ ኣለዎም ፣ ብዙሕ ናይ ኮረብታ ምደበር ጥዑይ ዓቐን ዘሎ ሃሳስ በረድ ተቐበለ ከምኡውን ከም ስኪንግ ከምኡውን ናይ በረድ ምንሽርታት ምንቅስቓሳት ይህብ"" which translates to: ""But, in windy weather, they have a beautiful appearance with a certain sparkle, and a delightful feeling of the rain falling, as well as the skating and the movement of the raindrops.""

This indicates that the vibrant display of raindrops, described as ""delightful"" and involving ""skating"" and ""movement,"" happens *during windy weather* (ሓጋይ እዋን). The passage doesn't specifically link it to the entire monsoon season, but rather to the active, windy periods *within* it.

ሓገዝ እትደሊ ጃልባ ኽትረክቡ እንተ ደሊኹም እንታይ ክተወግዱ ኣለኹም?,"The correct answer is **B: ምስ ካፕቴናት ምሕዝነት ምፍጣር (Building relationships with captains)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of networking and building relationships with captains of Jalba boats. It states you should make sure everything is perfectly bright after the cleaning, and then inform other Jalba boat owners.  The key idea is to *facilitate* connections – bringing boats closer to people, protecting passengers, etc. This directly relates to fostering good relationships with captains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ መዐሸጊ መራኽብ ላዕልን ታሕቲ ምባል (Being at the harbor both above and below)**: While being present at the harbor is important, it's not the *primary* action described in the passage.  The passage focuses on building relationships and facilitating connections, not just physical presence.
* **C: ኣገልግሎትኩም ምውዕዋዕ (Improving your service)**: Improving service is important, but the passage emphasizes *networking* and *facilitation* more strongly.
* **D: ብናጻ ኣብቲ ጃልባ ዝጉዓዙ ብጾታት ሸለል ምባል (Offering free rides on the Jalba boats)**: Offering free rides isn't mentioned in the passage, and isn't the core action to help people.



Therefore, building relationships with captains is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of actively helping sailors in the marina – offering assistance with their boats, guiding them, and providing support. Option A, ""interacting with sailors,"" directly aligns with this core message.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኣብ ትሕቲ ራዳር ምጽናሕ (Operating under radar):** This contradicts the helpful and visible role described in the text.
*   **C: ንሰባት ጃልባኦም ኸጽርዩ ኸለዉ ጥራይ ቕረብዎም (Approaching only when sailors are ready):**  The text stresses *proactive* help, not waiting for sailors to ask.
*   **D: ብናጻ ኣብቲ ጃልባ ዝጉዓዙ ብጾታት ምውጋድ (Offering free meals on the boat):** While offering food could be a form of help, the passage is broader than just providing meals. It encompasses a wider range of assistance.

The text states: ""እዚ ጽቡቕ መበገሲ ይኸውን እዩ<b>፣ ስለዚ ድማ ናይ'ቲ ቦታ ግዝኣታዊ ታሪኽ እንተደሊኻ</b>፣ እዚ ጽቡቕ መበገሲ ይኸውን እዩ።"" This translates to: ""This is a good prospect, **if you delve into the historical significance of the place**.""  The text then mentions that Hong Kong Island is linked to Kowloon waterfront and rises from the northern peninsula.  Since Central is the core of Hong Kong Island and where its historical significance lies, option C is the best fit.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሰሜናዊ ገማግም ባሕሪ (Northern Peninsula)** - This is just a geographical feature (the peninsula) and not the location with the historical significance.
*   **B: ኮውሎን ዋተርፍሮንት (Kowloon Waterfront)** - While historically important, the text focuses on Hong Kong Island's history.
*   **D: ቪክቶርያ ሃርቦር (Victoria Harbour)** - Victoria Harbour is a geographical feature and a beautiful sight, but the text's emphasis is on the *historical* significance of the island itself.



"

The text explicitly states: "" ንሆንግ ኮንግ ንምርኣይ ነታ ደሴት ገዲፍኩም ብተቓራኒኡ ናብ ኮውሎን ዋትርፍሮንቲ ይኺዱ። ኢንግሊዛውያን ገዛእቲ ከም ናቶም ዝወሰድዎ ቦታ እዚ እዩ፣ ስለዚ ድማ ናይ'ቲ ቦታ ግዝኣታዊ ታሪኽ እንተደሊኻ፣ እዚ ጽቡቕ መበገሲ ይኸውን እዩ። ን ሆንግ ኮንግ ሓድጊ ሰማይ ዘምስላ ናይ ህንፀታት መስርዕ ብ ግሁድ ማያት ቪክቶርያ ሃርቦር ዝተሰርሐ ዘብለጭልጭ ቻርት መታወር እያ ትምሰል።"" which translates to: ""To appreciate Hong Kong, you will sail to the opposite side towards Kowloon waterfront. This is the place the English considered as their own, so if you delve into the historical background of the place, this is a wonderful prospect.  Hong Kong's skyline is adorned with a stunning architectural marvel created by the iconic Victoria Harbour.""

Therefore, Victoria Harbour is highlighted as the place with the iconic skyline and stunning architectural marvel, making it the best answer for a location offering a panoramic view.

Here's why:

The text states that some carriages, particularly English carriages, have a safety bar that prevents the horse from rearing up and kicking, thus reducing the risk of injury. This safety bar is attached to the stirrups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ጸበብቲ መርገጺ (Guide ropes):** Guide ropes are used for controlling the horse's direction, not preventing it from rearing.
* **C: ቆርበት ስቲርኣፕስ (Stirrup locks):** Stirrup locks prevent the stirrups from accidentally opening, but they don't address the risk of the horse kicking.
* **D: ዝዓበየ ምርግጋእ (Padded harness):** A padded harness provides comfort for the horse, but it doesn't directly prevent injury to the rider.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ኩሎም ጋለብቲ ታኮ ዘለዎን ልሙጽን ኣብ ጫፉ ከዓ ሾጣጥ መጋለቢ ጫማ ይገብሩ"" which translates to ""All stirrups have a taco and a pole, and a wider footplate is also attached to the end."" This indicates the wider end of the stirrup provides a secure platform for the rider's foot, allowing them to maintain balance.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ሓርፋፍን ጸቢብን ጫፍ (Sharp and pointed end):** While there's a pointed end, it's not the primary feature for balance.
*   **B: ቆርበት (Collar):** This refers to a part of the saddle, not the stirrup.
*   **C: ሸኾና (Twist):** This refers to a feature in some English stirrups for preventing the foot from slipping. It's not about balance.

The text states: ""ሓሓሊፋ'ውን ምስ ካብ መጣቐስቲን ቅድሚ ሕዚ ዝተኣናገዱ ተጉዓዝቲ ፅሒፍም ዝሖለፍዎ ናይ ገምጋም ፅቢ ናይ ገጠር ኣመሓድራ ካውንችሰርፊንግ ናይ ቕበላ አጋይሽ ድርጅት ልውውጥ ኔትወርክ እንትኸውን ዝተመስረተሉ ኣጋጣሚ እ.""  This translates to: ""Also, the opportunity for a receiving exchange network traveler's rural spirit of adventure, which was previously connected with other travelers before arrival, to become a receiving exchange network traveler's wired network, is what it was founded on.""

This clearly indicates that the network was founded on the connections and shared spirit of adventure between travelers who met each other. Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer.

Here's why:

The passage states that the network was initially created based on the *existing* travel patterns of the local farmers.  It mentions the founder, K.C. Fenton, observed their routes and built the network *around* those routes.  The travelers didn't *provide* a list of roads; the network was *derived from* their actual travel.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: ንገያሾ ኩሉ ግዜ ንናይ ከባቢ ኣአንገድቲ መወከሲ ይወሃቦም (Travelers always provide information about the local roads.)** - While the passage doesn't explicitly state ""always,"" it implies that the network's creation depended on the travelers' existing routes and observations.
*   **B: ገለ መርበባት ተወሳኺ ምርግጋጽ ተጓዓዝቲ ከድልዮም ይኽእል እዩ (Some routes may require additional checks.)** - The passage mentions that the founder observed the travelers' routes and built the network *around* them, implying that further checks and confirmation could be necessary.
*   **D: ሪኢቶታት ናይቲ ከባቢ ኣአንገድቲ ሓደ ሓደ ግዜ ንተጉዓዝቲ ይቐርብ (Local road observations are sometimes shared with travelers.)** - The founder observed the routes and built the network around them, suggesting sharing or providing this information to travelers.

This translates to: ""Many people are on a budget, but most of the time you can also find budget-friendly travelers. Families with children have been seen traveling together, but some hostels allow groups in the youth section.""

This indicates that hostels in the youth section are generally frequented by budget travelers, particularly those in the early stages of their travels. The other options don't align with the information provided.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ህጻናት ዘለዎም ቤተሰብ ሓልሕሊፉ ዝረኣዩ እዮም"" which translates to ""Families with children have been seen.""  It further mentions that while many hostels don't allow infants in the ""gili"" (likely a specific area within the hostel), some hostels *do* allow families with infants.  This implies that families with newborns have found hostels that accommodate them, suggesting they have the most success.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: ብሓባር ዝጓዓዙ ሰለስተ ደቂ 22 ዓመት ሰባት (Three 22-year-old people traveling together):**  There's no specific mention of challenges for this group in the text.

* **D: ምስ ደቆም ዝጓዓዙ ክልተ ስድራቤታት (Two relatives traveling with a dog):**  The text doesn't mention pets as a factor in hostel accommodation.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""ቦሜራንግ ምስንዳው ብዙሕ ጎብነይቲ ክረክቡ ዝደልይዎ ተፈታዊ ክእለት እዩ"" (A boomerang is a fantastic skill that many people struggle to master). It also says that many boomerangs thrown in Australia *don't* return. The key takeaway is that *when thrown correctly*, it returns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ካብ በጻሕቲ ዓዲ ኣብ ደቂ ዓዲ ዝያዳ ተፈታዊ’ዩ (It's more skillful from a civilized country to people.)**  The text doesn't mention anything about skill being tied to ""civilized countries"" or people.
* **C: ኣብ ኣውስትራልያ ብዙሓት ቦሜራንግ ኣይርከቡን (Many boomerangs aren't thrown in Australia.)** The text says that *many* boomerangs thrown in Australia *don't return*, not that they aren't thrown there at all.
* **D: ገለ ቦሜራንግ ጥራይ እዮም ክምለሱ ዝኽእሉ (Only some boomerangs can return.)** The text implies that a correctly thrown boomerang *will* return, not just some of them.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: ጻዕዳ ሽኮር (Plain Shikor):** While shikor itself is mentioned, the emphasis is on the coconut version.
* **B: ሕሩጭ ሽኮር (Root Shikor):** The text doesn't mention root shikor.
* **D: ቡናዊ ሽኮር (Brown Shikor):** The text doesn't mention brown shikor.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is coconut shikor.

Therefore, the passage indicates that vaccination is a method used to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The question asks what is *not* considered a contagious disease.  The options list different types of pathogens, and vaccination is the action taken *against* contagious diseases.

The other options are all types of pathogens:

* **B: ቫይረሳት (Viruses)**
* **C: ባክቴርያ (Bacteria)**

Here's why:

* **The prompt describes a VPN's key benefit:**  VPNs offer a secure tunnel for *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP. This protects everything from browsing to apps to downloads.
* **The options:**
    * **A** directly reflects the primary advantage of a VPN.
    * **B** is a valid reason to use a VPN, but it's not the *most* compelling reason compared to routing *all* traffic.
    * **C** is incorrect because VPNs go beyond just HTTP.
    * **D** describes a function related to bandwidth aggregation, which is not a primary function of a VPN.

Therefore, the scenario where a VPN is significantly better than a web proxy is when the user wants to secure *all* of their internet traffic, not just HTTP.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that VPNs ""can redirect *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP."" Option D directly contradicts this statement.

Here's why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: ቪፒኤን ብተለምዶ ካብ ዌብ ፕሮክሲ ዝለዓለ ባንድዊድዝ የቕርቡ (VPNs typically offer larger bandwidths than web proxies)** - The passage mentions VPNs provide ""larger bandwidth"" and ""high-speed services.""

*   **C: ዌብ ፕሮክሲ ምስ ቪፒኤን ክነጻጸር እንከሎ ትሑት ጽሬት ኣገልግሎት ኣለዎም (Web proxies have lower security than VPNs)** - The passage states VPNs are ""problematic due to their security."""

Here's why:

The text explains that because landline phones are now internet-based, you can use internet-based phone numbers (like VoIP) regardless of your location.  This allows you to receive calls at your current location or a new location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ዓለምለኻዊ ቁጽሪ ተሌፎን (International telephone numbers):** While you *can* get an international number, the text emphasizes the shift to internet-based numbers as the primary solution to the landline issue.
* **C: ሳተላይታት (Satellites):** Satellite internet can enable internet-based phones, but it's not the core answer. The question is about the type of phone number used.
* **D: PSTN ስልክታት (PSTN telephones):** The text states that PSTN phones are becoming less relevant because landlines are going internet-based.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that internet-based addresses are the solution.

Here's why:

The passage states that because landline phones are now connected via the internet, traditional landline companies can't ""attack"" your location. It also mentions you can get satellite internet in remote areas like the Alaskan wilderness or the Arizona desert.  The key takeaway is that you can still *receive* calls from anywhere in the world using a global number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኣብ ከባቢኹም ዝርከብ ናይ ቴለፎን ትካል ምጥቃም (Attacking a local telephone company):** This is directly contradicted by the passage's main point.
*   **C: ካብ ከባቢኹም ቁጽሪ ምውሳድ (Getting a local number):** The passage implies a local number isn't necessary, given the internet-based nature of modern phone systems and the ability to use an international number.
*   **D: ናይ PSTN ስልኪ ምግዛእ (Buying PSTN cables):**  The passage explicitly says PSTN landlines are becoming obsolete, and buying cables is not a solution.

Therefore, **buying an international number** is the action recommended based on the passage.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Italian pronunciation is tricky *because* the words are mostly pronounced as they are written. Option B directly contradicts this statement. The text argues that the *consistency* of spelling and pronunciation is what makes Italian challenging, not the other way around.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ድርብ ኣር ካብ ንጽል ኣር ብዝተፈለየ መንገዲ እዩ ዝንበብ (The double 'r' is pronounced differently from the single 'r').**  This is *consistent* with the text's emphasis on how pronunciation *follows* spelling.
* **C: ፊደላት ሲ ን ጂ ን ዘለዎም ቃላት ሸወድቲ ክኾኑ ይኽእሉ እዮም (The letters 'ci' and 'gi' can be silent in some words).** This also aligns with the text, which explains that certain letter combinations can be silent, adding to the difficulty.
* **D: ኣነባበባ መብዛሕትኦም ቃላት ከከምዚ ዝስዕብ ኣድማጺ ይፈላለ (Reading most words is a confusing process like this).** This is a general statement that supports the text's central argument.



Therefore, only option B directly contradicts the main point of the text.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Izmir is an ancient city with a history dating back to the ancient Smyrna.  Wide boulevards are a characteristic often found in ancient cities designed for public gatherings and processions.  The other options (modern metro buildings, commercial centers, and a shell-shaped harbor) are all modern developments.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states Izmir is located on the shores of a sea of **""ሓደ ዓርሞሸሽ ናይ ባሕሪ ክሳድ መሬት"" (a large coastal plain)**. It does *not* mention a large swamp.
* Options B, C, and D are all consistent with the information provided in the text.  Izmir has a historical Turkish influence, modern infrastructure, Christian churches, and is indeed the third-largest port city in Turkey.

The passage then goes on to say the tradition involves cherry blossoms. Therefore, Hanami refers to the viewing of cherry blossoms.

This indicates the nobility (ጃፓናውያን ምልከ-ልዑላን) were the first to be invited.

While the idea of appreciating cherry blossoms came from China, the *initially* held parties were for the Japanese nobility. Therefore, the answer is not A or D.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Jerusalem is holy to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This religious significance is highlighted as a major reason for its importance and a key factor in tourism.
* While the other options are true about Jerusalem, the passage emphasizes the *religious* significance as the primary driver of tourism, particularly because of its role as a spiritual and religious center.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes Jerusalem's religious importance (holy to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) and its historical significance. It also mentions its economic vibrancy and historical sites. However, the question asks what aspect of Jerusalem is *not* explained in the passage.

While the passage touches on the *impact* of its religious significance, it doesn't delve into the complex *political* implications of its status. Jerusalem is a highly contested city with a long history of political disputes, particularly regarding its control and division. This aspect is left unaddressed in the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: መሳጢ ታሪኽ (Complex History):** The passage explicitly mentions Jerusalem's rich and long history.
*   **C: ሃይማኖታዊ ትርጉም (Religious Significance):** The entire passage dedicates a significant portion to Jerusalem's religious importance.
*   **D: ባህላዊ ቦታታት (Cultural Sites):** The passage mentions historical sites and cultural aspects of the city.

Here's why:

The text states that the Wild Card is beneficial for visiting *multiple* South African national parks. It also mentions that Kruger National Park is a major tourism destination and part of SANParks. Therefore, someone planning to visit Kruger *and* other parks would benefit from a Wild Card.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብዝተኻእለ መጠን ንብዙሓት ናይ ደቡብ ኣፍሪቃብሄራዊ ፓርክ (SANParks) ክበጽሕ መደብ ዘለዎ ተጓዓዛይ** - While technically true, option D is a *more specific* and therefore a better answer. Option A is a bit too broad.
* **B: ብሄራዊ ፓርክ ክሩገር ጥራይ ዝበጽሕ ተጓዓዛይ** - This is incorrect because the Wild Card is explicitly stated to be beneficial for visiting multiple parks, including Kruger but also others.
* **C: ብዛዕባ ክፍሊት ፓርክ ዝግደስ ናይ ባጀት ተጓዓዛይ** - The text doesn't mention anything about budget-related travel or a specific budget type of travel.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Kruger National Park is divided into 14 different ecosystems. However, it *doesn't* say that animals *specifically* are found *between* these ecosystems. It implies animals are present *within* each ecosystem, but doesn't detail the distribution *between* them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ከም ቀንዲ መስሕብ ደቡብ ኣፍሪቃ ይቑጸር** (It is described as the main hub of South Africa): The text *does* state this.
*   **C: ካብ ብሄራዊ ፓርክታት ደቡብ ኣፍሪቃ እቲ ዝነኣሰ እዩ** (It is the largest of the South African national parks): While the text mentions Kruger is a large park, it doesn't explicitly call it the *largest*.
*   **D: ንበጻሕቲ ብመገዲ ምዕዳግ ዋይልድ ካርድ ክረኽብዎ ይኽእሉ** (Visitors can find a Wild Card to facilitate their stay): The text *does* mention that a Wild Card can be beneficial for visitors.

* The text explicitly states that ""ናይ እምኒ ኣስካላታት ኣብ ልዕሊ መብዛሕትኡ ክፋል ናይቲ መንገዲ ተነጺፎም ይርከቡ"" (Icefalls cover most of the route) and "" ኣብቲ ዝያዳ ጸዳፍ ክፋላት ናይ ኣቻዮ ኢድ መደገፊ ሓገዝ ይህቡ"" (they provide support in the steepest sections).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ርስሓት ዘለዎ ኩነታት (Weather conditions):** While weather is always a factor in mountain climbing, the text doesn't highlight weather *specifically* as the *most likely* danger related to icefalls.
* **C: ንእሽቶ በዓቲ (Small caves):**  The caves are mentioned as a potential sheltered spot, not a danger.
* **D: ናይ ሓጺን ገመዳት (Short spans):** Short spans are a potential challenge on the route, but the text focuses on the dangers *related to the icefalls themselves*, not the spans.

Here's why:

The text explicitly warns against exhaling at the edge of the cliff. It says that people with experience can make it within 45 minutes, but there are many trails where the rocks are unstable, and in the most dangerous areas, there's a lack of handrails. The text emphasizes the importance of caution, especially in secluded spots, and advises finding a small sheltered area with a hollow beneath the cliff's edge if you reach the edge.

Option A directly contradicts this warning. It suggests that exhaling at the edge is permissible, which is the opposite of what the text advises.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ምሉእ እቲ ጸዳፍ ክፋላት መትሓዚ ኢድ የብሉን (There are no handrails in the entire dangerous section):** The text states there *are* handrails in the most dangerous areas.
* **C: ኣብ ላዕሊ ብዘሎ በዓቲ ክትሓልፍ ኣለኩም (You passed above the cave):** The text mentions finding a sheltered area *with* a hollow beneath the cliff's edge, not passing above a cave.
* **D: እቶም ጸዳፍ ክፋላት ርሑሱ ምስ ዝኸውን ሓደገኛታት ይኾኑ (The dangerous sections become dangerous when they are narrow):** The text warns that unstable rocks are dangerous in many trails, not specifically when they become narrow.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Majorcan cuisine is similar to Mediterranean cuisines and relies heavily on **pork (especially shoulder)** and **lamb**. It also mentions **olive oil** and ingredients like cheese and tuna. While fish is part of Mediterranean cuisine, the text doesn't highlight it as a *key* or defining element of Majorcan cuisine in the same way pork and lamb are. 

Therefore, fish is the least emphasized ingredient among the options in the provided text.

Here's why:

The text states that hangi traditionally uses steam from **natural hot springs** or geothermal sources. It *doesn't* say it uses wind-blown steam. Option A incorrectly attributes the steam source to wind.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **B: ውዑይ ኣእማን ዝጥቀም ሃንጊ ኣብ ዌሊንግተን ይርከብ** (Hangi using steam is found in Wellington) - The text mentions hangi pits in Christchurch and Wellington.
*   **C: ዝጥበስ ድራር መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ብሃንጊ እዩ ዝኽሸን** (Steam is often used to cook in hangi) - The text explicitly states that hangi uses steam for cooking.
*   **D: ጂኦተርማል ሃንጊ ኣብ ሮቶሩዋ ክርኸብ ይክኣል** (Geothermal hangi can be found in Rotorua) - The text mentions geothermal vents and hangi pits in Rotorua.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states that Hangi pits are typically created by:

*   **Small streams**
*   **Wind**
*   **Geothermal vents**

Gas is not mentioned as a typical cause for creating Hangi pits. Therefore, it's the correct answer to the question of what is *not* a common method.

The other options (B, C, and D, which is a duplicate of B) *are* mentioned as common methods."

Here's why:

The provided text discusses the clothing worn by nuns and monks. It highlights the importance of a plain habit and discourages elaborate or overly decorated clothing. Option C directly relates to this by mentioning embroidery originating from the monastery, which implies a certain level of craftsmanship and detail *within the acceptable bounds* of monastic attire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ብድሙቕ ዝተሸፈነ መጠቕለሊ ምኽዳን (Elaborate, covered embroidery):** This is the opposite of what the text advocates, which emphasizes plainness.
*   **B: መንኵብኩም ምሽፋን (Monastic robes):** While monks wear robes, this is too general. The text is specifically talking about the *decoration* or embroidery on those robes.
*   **D: ልዕሊ ብርኪ ዝተቖርጸ ስረ ምኽዳን (Embroidery above the hem):** This implies embroidery in a specific, potentially excessive, location. The text cautions against any decoration that is overly ostentatious or breaks the simple, uniform habit.

Therefore, **C** best reflects the context of the text, suggesting that while some embroidery *might* exist, it would be within the framework of monastic simplicity."

Here's why:

The passage states that nuns (deq'i' anstiyo) are allowed to wear long, loose-fitting skirts (qamisat) and cover their heads. However, it explicitly warns against wearing short skirts (ḥaṣir gurdì).  This is considered inappropriate and could lead to criticism. The passage implies that other skirt lengths (like a regular skirt - sra, or a longer skirt - maqtelali) might be acceptable, although the text doesn't give a definitive ""yes"" to those.

Therefore, a short skirt is the one that a nun *cannot* wear according to the guidelines outlined in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...በቶም ከዋኽብቲ እውን ክትዘናግዑ ክትኽእሉ ኢኹም።"" (meaning: ""...stars can also shine""). This implies that minimal light pollution is key to seeing stars.
* **Antarctica's remoteness and low population** contribute to low light pollution.
* While periods of low light pollution happen during polar nights (option A), the passage emphasizes *overall* low light pollution as a key factor.
* Option B (""when the population is low"") is related but not as direct as option D.  The lack of people *contributes* to low light pollution.
* Option C (""during the polar night"") is a *specific* condition that *leads* to the possibility of seeing the aurora australis and stars, but it's not the overarching reason for *more* opportunities to see stars.

Therefore, the best answer is **D** because it addresses the core requirement for stargazing: minimal light pollution.

The text states: ""ብሓፈሻ ናይ ሳተላይት ቴሌፎን መተካእታ ናይ ሞባይል ቴሌፎን ኣይኮነን፣ ስለምንታይ ቴሌፎን ንምድዋል ኣብ ደገ ከምኡ'ውን ምስ'ቲ ሳተላይት ንጹር ናይ ርክብ መስመር ክህልወካ ስለዘለዎ"" (In essence, satellite phone replacement for a mobile phone is not the same, because the phone needs to be directed to the satellite and have a clear connection line with it).

This means the key difference is the need for a direct line of sight to the satellite. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the text emphasizes the *connection to the satellite* as the primary requirement, not just remoteness, the ability to be carried in a bag, or the existence of a few data packets.

Here's why:

The text states that satellite phones are useful in remote areas *without* mobile coverage. This implies they emerged as a solution when mobile data wasn't available. Options A, B, and D don't directly relate to the core reason for the development of satellite phones – addressing the lack of mobile connectivity in remote locations.

The text explicitly states that Transnistria's creation was sparked by a conflict over **ethnic** differences. It mentions that Moldova is a multi-ethnic state that experienced a conflict, and the breakaway republic was formed in the wake of the conflict, largely due to the desire of the predominantly Russian-speaking population in the eastern part of Moldova for greater autonomy or independence. The text highlights the Russian language's prevalence in Transnistria, further supporting the ethnic dimension of the conflict.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኢኮኖሚ (Economy)**: While economic factors might play a role in any conflict, the text doesn't identify economics as the primary cause of the Transnistrian conflict.
*   **C: ቋንቋ (Language)**: While language is mentioned as a factor (Russian language prevalence), it's the ethnic dimension that drove the conflict. Language differences often intersect with ethnic differences, but aren't the root cause in this case.
*   **D: ሃይማኖት (Religion)**: The text mentions Orthodox Christianity as the dominant religion in Moldova but doesn't link religion to the Transnistrian conflict."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቋንቋ (Language):** The text says Romanian is the official language of Moldova and Russian is widely spoken in Transnistria, but doesn't highlight language as a defining difference *from other parts of Moldova*.
* **B: ሃይማኖት (Religion):** Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religion in Moldova as a whole, and also in Transnistria. It's not a defining difference *from other parts of Moldova*.
* **D: ገንዘብ (Economy):** While Transnistria has rebuilt its economy, the text doesn't present its economy as a uniquely defining characteristic compared to other parts of Moldova.

Here's why:

The text states that Montevideo is located in the Tropics and experiences very hot summers (over +30°C). It also mentions that the wind is so strong it can lower the temperature below the thermometer reading.  Therefore, a traveler hoping to benefit from the wind would want to visit during the humid Northern Fall when the wind is strongest and potentially cooler (compared to the hot summer).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ኣብ ደረቕ ወቕቲ ሞንቴቪዴኢ (In the dry season of Montevideo):** The text says the dry season is just as frequent as the rainy season, and the wind isn't specifically mentioned as a benefit during the dry season.
*   **C: ኣብ ኣዋርሕ ክረምቲ ሰሜናዊ ንፍቀ ክቢ (In the humid Northern Fall):** While the humid Northern Fall *is* a good option, option A is more precise.
*   **D: ኣብ ኣዋርሕ ሓጋይ ሞንቴቪዴኢ (In the humid summer of Montevideo):** The text explicitly states that the summer is very hot. Someone hoping for the cooling effect of the wind would *not* want to visit during the summer.

Here's why:

The passage states that Montevideo is located south of the Tropic of Capricorn and experiences intense heat (temperatures above +30°C) during the summer. It also mentions that the heat is very humid, with high humidity levels. A traveler seeking a slightly cooler climate would likely choose to visit when the heat is most intense, expecting the humidity to be high.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ሰሜናዊ ንፍቀ ክቢ ክረምቲ ምስ ኮነ (When it is cold in the Northern Hemisphere):** While this might be a time when Montevideo is relatively mild, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as a *reason* for someone seeking a slightly cooler climate.
* **C: ናይ ሞንተቪድዮ ናይ ዝናብ ወቕቲ ምስ ኮነ (When the rainy season occurs in Montevideo):** The passage states the rainy and dry seasons are roughly the same length.  It doesn't specifically suggest this would make the climate significantly cooler.
* **D: ኣብ ሰሜናዊ ንፍቀ ክቢ ሓጋይ ምስ ኮነ (When it is hot in the Northern Hemisphere):** This is too general. The passage specifically focuses on Montevideo's intense heat during *its* summer.

Therefore, the most logical reason for someone seeking a slightly cooler climate to visit Montevideo would be during its intense heat.

Here's why:

* **The passage argues that while street art has a history of being considered vandalism, it now has a more established and legally recognized form.** It highlights the distinction between illicit tagging and more organized street art.
* **Option C directly relates to the historical issue of vandalism.**  The passage implies that actions like unauthorized depiction of public property are *not* part of the now more recognized and legally navigated world of street art.
* **The other options are less directly related:**
    * **A: ፍጻመታት ምጽሓፍ ጽሑፍ (Writing narratives of endings)** -  This is a general artistic concept, not specifically tied to the legal status of street art.
    * **B: ስክሪብል (Scribble)** - This is too broad and doesn't capture the legal complexities discussed in the passage.
    * **D: ዘይንበብ መለለዪታት (Unlicensed derivatives)** - While related to copyright, the passage focuses more on the legality of *placement* and *form* of street art, not derivative works.



Therefore, option C most accurately reflects what the passage is arguing *against* in the context of modern street art.

Here's why:

The text states: ""מብዛሕቲኦም ተዓደምቲ ናይቲ ፃንሒት ወሳኒ ኽፍሊ ጌሮም ይቖፅርዎ"" which translates to ""Many attendees cherish the central part of the experience - camping there (spending the night there).""

Therefore, the central part of the experience that many attendees value is camping at the festival location.

Prepare the camp area close to the place that honors music to be in the front row.""

This indicates that arriving early (ኣምስዩ ብምኻድ) is beneficial to secure a good spot close to the music and to take advantage of special learning spaces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ ንስድራቤታት ዝኸውን ቦታ ምጽናሕ (Ab nsidrabetat zihawun bota mtsinah) - Going to a place for relatives:** While this is mentioned as a benefit, it's not the primary recommendation for those wanting to be close to the music.
* **C: ካብ ቦታ ወጻኢ ካምፕ ምግባር (Kab bota wtsai camp mgbar) - Camping from outside the camp:** The text explicitly advises *against* this, suggesting you should camp within the music-focused area.
* **D: ብኣግኡ ምእታው (B ag'u mg'taw) - Coming with your baggage:**  While you need your baggage, the text focuses on arriving early, not just arriving with your things.

Here's why:

The passage states that to find a significant amount of gambling opportunities, you need to go beyond Albuquerque or Santa Fe. It specifically mentions that casinos located two hours from Albuquerque are close and offer a good place to have fun.  It contrasts this with smaller towns which aren't ideal for constant gambling.

Option B (Pueblo) is mentioned as a place where Pueblo people traditionally gamble, but not necessarily a location with *significant* gambling opportunities for a general visitor.

Option C (near Santa Fe) is mentioned as being closer to Albuquerque, implying it's not as far as the two-hour drive.

Option D (in a small town) is explicitly stated as not a good place for constant gambling.

It further mentions that Australians have a coffee concept called 'Flat White'. While other options are mentioned in the text, the Australian wine is explicitly presented as something that can be aged and is part of the described culinary scene.  The question asks what budget-conscious travelers *prefer* to consume. Aged Australian wine is a possibility. The other options (aged water, coffee, Belgian chocolates) don't fit the criteria of something a budget-conscious traveler might *prefer* to consume as a *traveler*.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly describes espresso as a short, strong coffee. It also mentions cappuccino (with cream) and ""ሻሂ ብዘይ ጸባ"" (tea without milk).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ቁጽሪ ሓደ (Quantity one):** This is a general request and not specific to the context of the described beverages.
*   **C: ካብ ኒውዚላንድ ዝመጸ ሶቪንዮን ብላንክ (Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand):** The passage mentions New Zealand wines but doesn't mention Sauvignon Blanc.
*   **D: ጥፍጡፍ ጻዕዳ (Tiffuf Tsa'ada - Aussie slang for a coffee):** This is a description of an Australian coffee habit, not a specific order you would place with a waiter.

Therefore, espresso is the only option directly mentioned and suitable for ordering from a waiter based on the passage.

This translates to: ""Paraguay, known as the ""Indian Amazon"" in the 16th century, was founded due to the collision of warring indigenous groups with the Spanish. The Spanish began a three-century reign. Since 1537, since the founding of Asunción, Paraguay has increasingly defined the country's identity and character.""

The text clarifies that Paraguay was founded due to the conflict between indigenous groups, specifically mentioning the **Guarani** ( ጉራኒ) as one of them.  The Guarani were a powerful indigenous group who clashed with the Spanish and other indigenous groups, leading to the establishment of Paraguay.

Here's why:

The passage describes Persians as being perceived as flamboyant, undisciplined, and arrogant.  The key point is that trying to conform to Parisian decorum and appearing overly ""business-like"" (like a ""Bien Levré"") is *not* well-received in Paris.  Therefore, to act in a way that is well-received by Parisians, one should be *humble* – the opposite of the traits the passage attributes to Persians.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ነቲ ናይ ፓሪሳዊ ኣተሓሳስባ ክትመስል ምፍታን (Trying to imitate the Parisian mindset):**  The passage says this is *not* a good idea.
*   **B: ርእሰ ተኣማንነት ምግዳፍ (Rejecting authority):** The passage doesn't mention rejecting authority.
*   **D: ንደገ ዝጥምት ባህርያት ምርኣይ (Observing supportive traits):** While observing traits is helpful, the passage emphasizes being *humble* to fit in, not simply observing other traits.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Parisians are perceived as ""ፍሉጣት"" (unique) due to their being ""ኣርሲ—ኣፍቃሪ"" (arrogant/proud), ""ዘይስነስርዓተኛ"" (disorganized), and ""ትዕቢተኛ"" (arrogant/conceited).  The passage then emphasizes that trying to act like a ""ቢየን ሌቭ"" (a very organized person) in Paris is not well-received, implying that the Parisians value a different, less formal demeanor.  The core theme is about the perceived arrogance and the contrast between that and structured behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ትዕቢት (Arrogance):** While arrogance *is* mentioned, it's one of several traits, not the *one* that is being contrasted with the ""ቢየን ሌቭ"" type.
* **B: ስርዓት ዘይምግባር (Disorganization):** This is another trait mentioned, but the text focuses more on how it interacts with the perception of arrogance.
* **D: ዘይእሩም ምዃን (Uncaring):** The text doesn't mention any aspect of Parisians being uncaring.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: ተጸዋታይ ምዃን (Arrogance)** because it is the central trait being contrasted with a structured type of behavior in Paris."

Here's why:

The passage states: "" ነፍሲ-ወከፍ ባቡር ሜትሮፕላስ ን ሜትሮ ኣሰልጠንቲ ኣለዎም ፤ሜትሮፕላስ ኣሰልጠንቲ ኩሉ ጊዜ ኣብ ቀረባ ኣብ ዝርከብ ኬፕታዉን ባቡር መወዳእታ እዮም።"" This translates to: ""The Metrorail commuter trains have Metrorail drivers; the Metrorail drivers are always near the ኬፕታዉን train at the end of its journey.""  While not explicitly stating the coach travels *ahead*, it implies the driver is at the rear, and thus the coach (containing passengers) is at the front.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ብዙሓት ሰባት የለዉን** (There aren't many people): The passage says Metrorail is ""ዝነኣሰ ዝተጨናነቐ"" (more crowded).
* **C: ካብ ናይ ሳልሳይ ደረጃ ትኬት ዝወሓደ ወጻኢታት ኣለዎ** (It has exits that are different from the third class ticket): The passage doesn't mention different exits.
* **D: ምስ ናይ ሜትሮ ትኬት ተመሳሳሊ ዋጋ’ዩ** (It has the same price as a Metro ticket): The passage doesn't mention the ticket price.

Here's why:

The text states: "" ነፍሲ-ወከፍ ባቡር ሜትሮፕላስ ን ሜትሮ ኣሰልጠንቲ ኣለዎም ፤ሜትሮፕላስ ኣሰልጠንቲ ኩሉ ጊዜ ኣብ ቀረባ ኣብ ዝርከብ ኬፕታዉን ባቡር መወዳእታ እዮም። "" which translates to ""The metro rail has single-fare metro coaches; the metro coaches always arrive at the end of the train running in Cape Town.""

This indicates that a single fare covers the entire journey on the metro rail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ንኽልቲኡ ደረጃታት ተመሳሳሊ ዋጋ ትኬት (Both tiers have the same ticket price)** - The text implies different tiers (Metropolitan and Metro) exist, so their ticket prices might not be the same.
*   **C: ሰለስተ ዝተፈላለዩ ደረጃታት (Three different tiers)** - The text only explicitly mentions two tiers (Metropolitan and Metro).
*   **D: ክልቲኦም ቀዳማይን ሳልሳይን ደረጃ ኮች (Both the first and third tier coaches)** -The question asks about a single fare, not specific coach tiers.

Here's why:

The passage states that dangerous animals that can transmit diseases to humans are usually classified as vectors (disease carriers).  Allergies are a *reaction* to an allergen, not a transmission of disease *from* an animal to a human. The other options (eating food, spreading fire, and being bitten by a dangerous predator) are all ways an animal *can* transmit disease or cause harm.

Here's why:

The text mentions that many prepaid cards are sold with a minimum recharge amount, and often the only way to recharge them is through small, often free, phone calls.  Corner shops are the most common place to find services that allow you to add value to prepaid phone cards, especially in situations where you don't have access to other methods.  The other options are not typically places where you'd recharge prepaid phone cards.

Here's why:

The text states that some cards, while good for roaming, limit the amount of data you can use in certain countries.  These services often charge a small fee for free phone calls.  The wording implies that the fees aren't just a flat charge, but are tied to the consumption of call minutes and potentially extra charges. Option D best reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ዉሱናት ሃገራት ጥራይ እዮም ክርከቡ ዝኽእሉ** (Only in tourist countries can they be deducted): The text doesn't specify that deduction is limited to tourist countries.
* **B: ብነጻ ቁጽርታት ኣቢሉ** (By free credits): The text talks about fees being deducted, not about receiving free credits.
* **C: ኣብቲ ናይ ኩርናዕ ድኳን** (In the worst case): This option doesn't align with the description of how the charges are applied.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣግራብ ኣየናይ እዩ ኣብ ፕሊትቪክ ሃይቅታት ብሄራዊ ፓርክ ብውሑድ ዝረአ?,"The correct answer is **C: ፊር (Fir)**.

The text states that Plitvice Lakes National Park has a diverse range of tree species, including beech, spruce, and fir.  The question asks which of the options is *uniquely* seen in the park. The text doesn't say any of the listed trees are *uniquely* seen, but it does highlight the park's diversity.  Since the question asks which one is *not* mentioned as a common tree type, and the text lists beech, spruce, and fir, then the answer must be one of those. However, the prompt asks which is ""uniquely"" seen, implying a single, rare species. Without further information in the text, it is not possible to definitively say which of the options is uniquely seen. However, given that ""fir"" is a common tree type mentioned, the question seems to be flawed.

Assuming the question meant to ask which tree is *listed* in the text, then all options are correct. However, since the prompt asks which is *uniquely* seen, and no information supports this, there is no correct answer.

Let's revisit the provided options and the text:

The text lists:
* Beech (bukaria)
* Spruce (sperus)
* Fir (fir)

The options are:
* Beech (bich)
* Spruce (cahdi)
* Fir (fir)
* Spruce (sprus)

All of the options are either a synonym or a misspelling of the trees that are mentioned in the text.

Therefore, without any additional clues or context, the question is flawed, and there is no definite ""correct"" answer. However, if we *must* choose one, ""fir"" is the closest to being a tree species mentioned in the text, and the options have slightly different spellings of the same tree species.

**However, the problem statement clearly states the question is asking which of the options is *uniquely* seen, and none of the information indicates any of those options are exclusively seen in the park.**

**Therefore, I must conclude that the question is flawed, and there is no correct answer based on the given text.**

**Given the options and the likely intended meaning of the question (which is flawed), the closest answer would be 'fir' because it is mentioned in the text as one of the tree types present in the park.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions ""ናይ በረኻ ድሙ"" which translates to ""wild boar"". A wild boar is a type of badger.
* The other options are not mentioned in the passage as animals that can be found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.

Therefore, the only correct answer based on the provided text is ሃኒ ባጀር (Hani Badger)."

The mention of ""debt collection"" directly relates to this goal.

While the passage mentions illegal copying (""ዘይሕጋዊ ምቕዳሕ""), it frames this as a tactic used by companies to increase debt collection efforts. The core purpose isn't the illegal copying itself, but the financial gain derived from it.

* **D: ንሽፍትነት ንምክልኻል ሳሕቲ እዮም ዝሕግዙ (They advocate for preventing fraud.)**  While potentially a side effect, the passage's main point is about money laundering, not fraud prevention.

Here's why:

The question asks what is generally not something you need to register or fulfill, even if you've been born in your birthplace. The text states that while a customs number *can* be corrected, it's not necessarily something you *need* to fulfill or register, even if you've been born there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምፍታሽ ኢሚግሬሽን (Immigration Inspection):** Immigration inspections are part of the immigration process and are required.
*   **B: ምዝገባ ኣቑሑት (Registration of Identification):** Registration of identification is generally a necessary legal requirement.
*   **C: ናይ ኣቑሑት ሕጋዊ ገደብ (Legal Limit of Identification):** This refers to the legal requirements for identification, which are often required.

Therefore, a **Customs Number** (ቁጽጽር ጉምሩክ) is the most fitting answer as it's something that might be necessary for certain situations but isn't always a mandatory registration, even if someone was born in their country."

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** is asking if the person was informed *before* immigrating about what they need to know.
* **The prompt (P)** states that while the immigration registration might not always be necessary, the customs declaration *can* be. And the key point is knowing what to declare *over the legal limit*.
* Option B directly addresses this – the legal limit on what can be brought into the country.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ናይ ኢሚግሬሽን መፈተሺ ቦታ ክህሉ እንተኾይኑ (If you had to visit an immigration inspector's office):**  This is a specific action, not a general piece of information one should know before immigrating.
* **C: ቁጽጽር ጉምሩክ ክህሉ እንተኾይኑ (If you had to declare a customs office):** This is too broad.  It doesn't specify *what* needs to be declared.
* **D: ዝኾነ ሒዝካዮ እትመጽእ ኣቕሓ ዘይፍቀድ እንተኾይኑ (If you didn't bring anything that wasn't allowed):** This is the *opposite* of what the prompt is trying to emphasize. The prompt is highlighting the importance of knowing the limits to *avoid* problems.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and relevant answer to the question, based on the provided information."

The passage also mentions that there are no airlines operating direct flights between the South Pacific and the South America's western coast, making it a complex route. This implies that Star Alliance is a key player in connecting those regions.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ስካይ ቲም (Sky Team)** - The passage doesn't mention Sky Team.
*   **C: ሳውዝ ፓስፊክ (South Pacific)** - South Pacific is a region, not an airline.
*   **D: ላታም ዋንዎርልድ (LATAM World)** - The passage doesn't mention LATAM World.

It also mentions viewing animals like lions, leopards, and cheetahs through binoculars.
* **The question asks:** What should someone do who hopes to see a cheetah clearly?
* **Binoculars are the tool specifically mentioned** as aiding in viewing animals clearly.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ኣብ ናይ እግሪ ጉዕዞ ሳፋሪ ምኻድ (Going on a safari walk):** While a safari walk *could* offer a chance to see a cheetah, it's not the *most direct* way to improve the chances of a clear view.
* **B: ኣብ ናይ እግሪ ጉዕዞ ቡሽ ምኻድ (Going on a bush walk):** Similar to option A, a bush walk might work but isn't specifically linked to clearer viewing.
* **D: ማኪና ሒዝኩም ስሩዕ መሳርሒታት ምጥቃም (Bring a car and shoot quickly):** This is completely inappropriate and potentially dangerous.  The passage emphasizes observing animals gently, not hunting them.

"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ዋጋ ዑደት ዝንኪ እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **A: ብውልቅኹም ምኻድ (By pooling)**.

The passage explains that the cost per person decreases as the group size increases. This is because the car is filled more efficiently, and the cost is shared among more people. Therefore, the ""ዋጋ ዑደት"" (cost reduction) is achieved by pooling together.
"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ መን እዩ ዝበለጸ ናይ ዑደት ዋጋ ከረጋግጽ ተኽእሎ ዘለዎ?,"The correct answer is **A: መኪና ንምቕያር ፍቓደኛታት ዝኾኑ በጻሕቲ (Volunteers who are willing to fill the car)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that to keep the cost per person down, groups of 4-6 people are organized.  It then explains this is because it's often necessary to move cars from one location to another to fill them.  The passage also mentions that a wealthy population contributes more money to offset this.

The question asks who can determine the ""price of the round trip"" according to the passage.  The passage implies that the price is determined by the number of people in each car. Since the cars are filled by volunteers willing to go, *they* are the ones whose willingness and number directly impact the cost per person.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ሰለስተ ኣባላት ዝሓቖፈ ጉጅለ (A group of three members)** - This is too small a group to optimize car usage.
*   **C: ብሓባር ዝጓዓዙ ክልተ ኣዕሩኽ (Two horses traveling together)** - This is irrelevant to the context of carpooling.
*   **D: ሓሙሽተ ሰባት ዝሓቖፈ ጉጅለ (A group of five people)** - While a valid group size, it doesn't directly determine the price. The *willingness of people* to form groups is key.

While San Francisco has economic diversity (C) and a rich Asian food scene (D), the passage emphasizes its frequent portrayal in arts and media as a way to showcase its unique identity. Option B is not mentioned in the passage. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.

Here's why:

* **The text states that San Francisco's economy is diversified**, with strong sectors in tech, professional services, government, finance, and insurance/tourism. It *doesn't* say the economy is *fully* reliant on tourism. Tourism is a significant contributor, but not the *only* one.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true based on the text:

* **A: ኣብ ፊልምታትን መጻሕፍትን ብዙሕ ግዜ ተራእዩ እዩ (It has often been seen in films and books):** The text explicitly mentions San Francisco being portrayed as a unique and attractive place in media.
* **B: ናይ ኤስያ ምግቢ ይርከብ እዩ (Asian cuisine is abundant):** The text states San Francisco is one of the most diverse places for Asian food, listing Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese.
* **C: ብዙሓት ሆቴላትን ማእከላት ኣኼባታትን ኣለዉ (There are many hotels and conference centers):** The text mentions San Francisco having many hotels and conference centers to accommodate visitors.



Therefore, option D is the statement that is *not* supported by the text."

The text explicitly states: ""ወይ'ውን ንመዓልቦኻ ዝከውን ካልእ ሰነዳት (ቪዛ) ከተምጽእ እንተደሊኻ ቦታ ክሓዝኡልካ ይኽእል እዮም።"" (Or if you need another document (visa) to travel, they can help you book a place.)

This implies that if a traveler lacks a necessary document like a visa, a travel agency can assist with booking, unlike with a traveler who has a visa or is not having issues with their travel plans.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ንውሳነ ዝሽገር ተጓዓዛይ (A suspicious traveler):** The text doesn't mention anything about travel agencies refusing service to suspicious travelers.
* **B: ብቕጽበት ናይ ምኻድ ዝንባለ ዘለዎ ተጓዓዛይ (A traveler who has an immediate travel need):** Travel agencies can generally accommodate travelers with immediate travel needs.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travel agencies offer services like booking flights, hotels, and packages. It mentions that they can even assist with visa applications.  However, it says that *directly* contacting the hotel for things like booking rooms or arranging airport transfers is more common. The passage *doesn't* say that travel agencies are particularly helpful with obtaining immediate travel documents (like visas) - it suggests they can *assist* with it, but it's not presented as a core benefit or something they excel at *compared to* other services.

The other options are benefits mentioned in the passage:

*   **B: ናይ ሆቴል ውዕላት (Hotel packages):** Travel agencies offer hotel packages.
*   **C: ኩሉ ዘጠቓልል ፓኬጃት (All-inclusive packages):** Travel agencies offer all-inclusive packages.

The text explicitly states that these apps can translate text ""directly"" and even ""on real-world signs or other things."" Option A best captures this capability.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ምሉእ ክፍልታት ጽሑፍ ምትርጓም (Translating entire text sections):** While some apps *can* translate entire sections, the text doesn't limit the capability to only that.

Here's why:

The question asks what enables translations to happen outside of the internet. The text states that ""ዝተመሓየሹ ናይ ትርጉም ሞተራት ብዘደንቕ ኩነታት ተመሓይሹ"" which translates to ""Demonstrated translation engines are developed in a way that..."" implying they are the key component allowing offline translation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ስማርትፎናት (Smartphones):** Smartphones are the devices *using* the translation engines, not what enable translations outside the internet.
* **C: ናይ ቋንቋ ዳታ ምውራድ (Language data download):** Downloading language data is *one way* to enable offline translation, but it's not the fundamental element that makes it possible.  It's a resource used *by* the translation engine.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ሓ ብዙሕ ግዜ ሰብ"" which translates to ""many times humans.""  Humans are explicitly mentioned as a cause of avalanches (or at least contribute to them).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ተጣባቒ በረድ (Slush Ice):** The passage describes avalanches as being caused by the slippery nature of snow. Slush ice doesn't inherently cause avalanches.
*   **C: ብርሃን ጸሓይ (Sunlight):** Sunlight can melt snow, but the passage indicates the main issue is the snow's slippery nature and the weight of it, not melting.
*   **D: ተወሳኺ በረድ (More Snow):** While more snow *can* contribute to avalanches, the passage mentions humans as a frequent cause. The increase of snow is a natural occurrence.



Therefore, based on the passage, humans are the cause of avalanches."

Here's why:

* **The passage describes snow that only accumulates on steep slopes and is transported by wind.** This aligns with option C.
* **The passage mentions that wind is crucial for transporting the snow.**  This further supports the idea of snow being deposited on steep slopes above the treeline, where wind action is strongest.
* **Option B describes snow that accumulates on steep slopes but *without* the wind transport aspect, which is a key element mentioned in the passage.**
* **Options A and D don't fit the description of wind-transported snow.** Avalanches are a rapid flow of snow, and the passage doesn't focus on avalanches specifically. Option D describes isolated snow without wind action.



Therefore, option C is the best fit for the description of the snow in the passage."

Here's why:

The passage states that the Antarctic Peninsula traverse (or voyage) is dangerous and marked with flags.  It also mentions the need for specialized equipment like a strong hull and other gear to handle the challenging conditions.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: መደበር ማክሙርዶ ዕጹው እዩ (Macmurdo Ice Shelf is the reason):** The passage doesn't explicitly state that the Macmurdo Ice Shelf *is* the reason for the traverse. It's a point *along* the traverse.
* **C: እተን ፍሉያት ትራክተራት ቅልጡፋት ኣይኮናን (Those special traverses aren't fast):**  The passage indicates the traverse is *slow* due to the challenges.
* **D: ካብ ብባሕሪ ሮስ ምጉዓዝ ዝቐለለ’ዩ (It's due to going out from the Ross Sea):** The passage describes the traverse *along* the Antarctic Peninsula, not *from* the Ross Sea.

It's more of a general statement about the benefits of car travel in South Africa.
* **C: ዳርጋ ኩለን እተን ጎረባብቲ ደቡብ ኣፍሪቃ ዝኾና ሃገራት ዝተረጋግኣ እየን (Darga kulen, the neighboring countries of South Africa are not stable.)** The passage mentions instability in neighboring countries, but it doesn't label it as an ""unexplained"" point.

* **D: ብመኪና ትጓዓዙ እንተኾይንኩም 4x4 ክትጥቀሙ ይምከር (If you travel by car, it is recommended to use a 4x4.)** The passage states this as a *recommendation*, not an unexplained point. It's a practical tip for traveling in South Africa.



Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the passage and presented as a key piece of information."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while you *can* drive in South Africa with a standard car, a 4x4 is highly recommended, and some areas *require* a 4x4 due to rough terrain.  It also highlights that South Africa is not as stable as its neighbors and warns about the potential for dangerous situations. The passage also mentions specific laws regarding dangerous items within the vehicle.

Option A aligns perfectly with this, implying that there are legal guidelines concerning what dangerous items can be transported. The other options are directly contradicted by the text:

*   **B:** The passage says a 4x4 is *often* necessary, not that a regular car works in all places.
*   **C:**  The passage cautions against driving off the main roads.
*   **D:** The passage implies some areas *are* suitable for travel, while others are not.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ክስረቑ ይኽእሉ እዮም (They could be stolen):** While theft is a risk, the passage focuses on the *physical danger* of carrying the bags incorrectly.
* **C: ምስ ናይ ካልእ ሰብ ክደናገሩ ይኽእሉ (You could help someone else):**  This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: ሰበስልጣን ከም ሓደጋ ቦም ክወስድዎም ይኽእሉ እዮም (They could be taken as a bomb threat by authorities):** This is a possible consequence, but the passage highlights the immediate danger of injury from carrying the bags improperly.

Here's why:

The text highlights the danger of resisting robbers and the severe punishments (imprisonment or death) in some countries. Option A directly reflects this danger by stating that merchants might be forced to pay with their lives, emphasizing the extreme consequences of resistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: ሓሽሽ ዝሽትቱ ኣኽላባት ብዘይ ምፍላጥ ክጥቀሙ ይኽእሉ (Robbed goods can be used without being checked):** This is incorrect. The text emphasizes the risk associated with the stolen bags, implying that they are dangerous and should not be used carelessly.
* **D: ዋላ እውን ሓሽሽ እንተዘይተሰኪምካ፡ ሰብመዚ ቦርሳታትኩም ክምንዝዑኹም ይኽእሉ እዮም (Even if you don't resist, people can steal these bags):** The text focuses on the dangers of resistance, not the possibility of theft even without it. It highlights that resisting is especially perilous.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""אብ እዋን ንጉሆ ገዛኹም ብጽቡቕ ቡናን አብ እዋን ምሸት ድማ ብዝተወሰኑ መዘናግዒ ኮሞሜል ሻሂ ይምልኡዎ"" which translates to ""At times, I filled his chambers with good coffee and at night with certain expensive Shahī."" The question asks what *type* of drink the passage refers to that the speaker would serve.  The passage directly identifies ""ሻሂ"" (Shahī) as a beverage.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ጽሟቕ (Ṣmāwq)** means ""long"" or ""extended.""
*   **B: ቡን (Būn)** means ""coffee.""
*   **C: ቢራ (Bīrā)** means ""beer.""

Here's why:

The passage describes a queen who enjoys a particular type of tea ( ቡና and ኮሞሜል).  The last sentence talks about the queen needing to find a simple mechanism for making breakfast if the tea stalls are too far apart.  This implies she needs a place to *buy* tea.

Option C, ""Pubs they don't frequent regularly,"" fits best.  It suggests a place that isn't her usual haunt, which is where she might need to find a supplier of the special tea. The other options don't logically connect to the problem described.

The passage explicitly states: "" ንመብዛሕትኦም ሃገራት ንምምሃር ካብ ክትመሃረሉ ትደሊ ናይ ኦፈር ደብዳበ ከምኡውን እንተወሓደ ንትወስዶ ትምህርቲ ዓይነታት ናይ ቀዳማይ ዓመት ወጪ ዓርስካ ንምድጋፍ ናይ ፊይናንሳዊ መርትዖ የድልዮ እዩ።"" (For most countries, to study, you need to provide financial proof, such as a scholarship and, if not, proof of funds to cover the annual tuition and living expenses.)

This directly links student visas with the requirement of demonstrating sufficient financial support.  Other visa types (tourist, work) may have financial requirements, but student visas are *specifically* mentioned as requiring financial proof.



"

The passage explicitly states: ""ብሓፈሻ ካብ ዝተለምደ ናይ ቱሪስት ወይ ከኣ ንግዳዊ ቪዛ በብዓይነቱ መለኪዕታት ከምኡውን ናይ ምሕትት ኣገባባት ኣለዎም። ንመብዛሕትኦም ሃገራት ንምምሃር ካብ ክትመሃረሉ ትደሊ ናይ ኦፈር ደብዳበ ከምኡውን እንተወሓደ ንትወስዶ ትምህርቲ ዓይነታት ናይ ቀዳማይ ዓመት ወጪ ዓርስካ ንምድጋፍ ናይ ፊይናንሳዊ መርትዖ የድልዮ እዩ። **ንናይታ ብዕምቆት ንቐጻሊ ክተጽንዐላ እትደሊ ሃገር ትካልን ክፍሊ ስደትን ኣረጋግጽ።**""

This means countries looking for long-term students have established processes and financial requirements.  International students are specifically mentioned as needing to demonstrate financial stability (proof of sufficient funds) to support their studies. This financial requirement, along with the long-term commitment to study, makes it easier for international students to obtain a visa compared to tourists or short-term visitors.



Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: ስሩዕ በጻሒ (Quick Writer):**  This has no connection to visa requirements.
*   **B: ወቕታዊ በጻሒ (Present Writer):**  This also has no connection to visa requirements.
*   **D: ናይ ንግዲ በጻሒ (For Sale Writer):**  This has no connection to visa requirements.

Translation: ""If you find yourself in the heart of a subtropical forest, those few minutes while you have your car running, it's a good time for a snake to get inside your car and bite you.""

Therefore, the snake is most likely to bite **while you are starting the car.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: "" ዋላ'ውን ብማእከል ናይ ሳብትሮፒካል ጫካ ትዝውር እንተለኻ፣ እተን ውሑዳት ደቓይቅ ማዕጾ ከፊትካ ንመኪናኻ ትኣተወሉ ግዜ، ጣንጡ ናብ ውሽጢ መኪናኻ ምሳኻ ንኽኣትዋ እኹል ግዜ እዩ። "" (If you find yourself in the heart of a subtropical forest, the time you leave your car idling for even a few minutes is enough for a snake to get inside.)

This indicates the problem is leaving the car running. The other options are not directly addressed by the text:

*   **B: ኣብ እዋን ሓጋይ መኪና ምዝዋር (Turning off the car engine when parked):** The text doesn't mention turning the engine off.
*   **C: ኣብ ትሕተ ትሮፒካዊ ከባቢታት ምዝዋር (Driving in subtropical areas):** This is a general location and doesn't address the specific issue.
*   **D: ኣብ እዋን ናይ እግሪ ጉዕዞ ነታ መኪና ንበይና ምግዳፍ (Avoiding leaving the car unattended during foot trips):** While related, the core problem is the idling engine.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: "" ሳንዳርባንስ 3,850 ኪሜ. ስኩዌር ቦታ እንትሽፍኑ ካብዚ እቲ ሲሶ ከዓ ብማይ/ትርኩስ ቦታ ዝተሸፈነ እዩ (Sundarbans spans 3,850 sq km, and of this, the area is also covered by water/tidal flats).""
* While Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, the text doesn't *specifically* say that it's the world's largest *in general*. It describes its size and the fact that it's covered by water/tidal flats, which is characteristic of mangrove forests.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

* **A: ገለ ካብቶም ዝተረፉ ውሑዳት ሓያላት ጫካታት ዝሓዘ እዩ (Some of the remaining wildlife have forests):** The text states that Sundarbans is a wildlife sanctuary and has a significant population of Bengal tigers.
* **B: ፍርቂ ጠቕላላ ስፍሓቱ ብረግረግ ዝተሸፈነ እዩ (The entire area is covered in dense forests):** The text mentions that the area is covered by water/tidal flats, which is a defining characteristic of mangrove forests. While there might be some forested areas, the water/tidal flats are also significant.
* **D: ካብ ነብሪ ቤንጋል ንላዕሊ ንጣብ ዘለዎም ዓገዘት ዝነብሩላ እያ (It has species larger than Bengal tigers):** The text states that Bengal tigers are among the wildlife found in Sundarbans, implying the existence of other species, potentially larger ones.

The text explicitly states: ""ብግዝኣት ህንዲ ዘሎ ክፋል ዱር ሳንዳርባንስ ሃገራዊ ፓርክ ተባሂሉ ይጽዋዕ"" which translates to ""The portion located in the Indian district is called Sundarbans National Park.""

Here's why:

The passage states: ""מብዛሕትኡ ክልል ክፋል ናይቲ ክልል እንግሊዘኛ ተዛራባይ እዩ ዋላ ካልኦት ቡዙሓት ውሱን ፍልጠት ይሃልቦም ብፍላይ ክዓ ኣናእሽቱ ሕብረተሰብ"" which translates to: ""For the most part, the local language is English, and many others offer limited knowledge, especially to the younger generation.""

This directly indicates that the younger generation has a limited understanding of the English language. Therefore, someone who primarily speaks other languages might have a limited perspective on English, *particularly if they are part of the younger generation*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: እንተወሓደ ብዛዕባ ቋንቋ እንግሊዝ ውሱን ርድኢት ክህልዎ ዝኽእል መን እዩ? (Specifically, to those who speak other languages)** This is too broad. The passage specifically points to the younger generation's limited understanding.
*   **C: ናብ ቶሮንቶ ዝገሹ ሰባት (People who came to Toronto)**  The passage mentions a Toronto restaurant as a setting, but it doesn't link coming to Toronto with having a limited view of the English language.
*   **D: ብዕድመ ዝዓበዩ ሰባት (People who have lived for a long time)** The passage focuses on the younger generation's limited understanding, not necessarily those who have lived there for a long time.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is **B**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""በተወሳኺ እውን እዚ ብፍላይ ድማ ትኽክለኛ ኣድራሻታት ንምፅዋዕ ከቢድ እዩ"" which translates to ""In addition, it is especially difficult to find correct addresses.""

The passage also mentions that many languages offer limited knowledge, especially to younger members of society, and that English is often the dominant language within a region. This context points to the difficulty in finding addresses as the main challenge related to communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ቃላት ብፍሉይ ላህጃ (Words in a unique dialect):** While the passage mentions unique word choices, it doesn't highlight the difficulty of *using* a unique dialect as the primary communication hurdle.
*   **C: ዝተጻሕፈ ቃላት (Written words):** The passage mentions that finding correct addresses is difficult, not that written words are problematic.
*   **D: ከባብያዊ ኣርጎት (Biblical style):** The passage doesn't mention biblical style as a challenge to communication.

Therefore, the passage explicitly identifies finding correct addresses as a significant difficulty in communication."

Here's why:

The passage states that local buses are often full, and it's best to buy tickets a few days in advance.  It also mentions that buses going to Jakar leave between 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM. Therefore, a traveler going to Jakar who had already bought a ticket would be in a comfortable situation.

* **C: እቲ ተጓዓዛይ ናብ ፓሮ ይኸይድ ስለዘሎ ድሕሪ ሰዓት 11 ክብገስ ኣለዎ (The traveler was going to Paro, so they should have woken up after 11:00 AM):** The passage doesn't mention departure times for Paro.

* The passage states that the local buses are often full, and it's necessary to buy tickets a few days in advance.
* The question asks for good advice for someone traveling east by inter-district bus.
* Option B directly addresses the issue of buses being full and the need to secure a ticket.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣውቶቡሳት ድሕሪ ሰዓት 8፡30 ጥራይ እየን ዝብገሳ (Buses only run after 8:30 AM)** - This is inaccurate. The passage states buses run from early in the morning.
* **C: ብዙሓት ኣውቶቡሳት ምሉእ መዓልቲ እየን ዝብገሳ (Many buses are full all day)** - While true, this doesn't offer *advice* on what to do. It just reiterates a problem.
* **D: ናይ ሓባር ታክሲ እቲ ዝበለጸ በሊሕ መገሻ ክኸውን ይኽእል እዩ (A shared taxi could be a luxurious alternative)** -  This is irrelevant to the question about buses and also about cost."

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""ብምኽንያት ሑፃታት ምድረበዳ ሓደጋ ከም ዘሎ ብ 1990 ኣብ ዝርዝር ሓድግታት ዓለም ብዝርዝር ተመዝጊቡ ኔሩ"" (Because of the desertification crisis, it was listed in the World Heritage List in 1990).  This directly indicates that Timbuctoo *is* affected by desertification and sandstorms.

* **The text confirms:**  ""ናይ ሄንሪ ሉዊስ ጌትስ ናይ PBS ፍሉይ ድንቅታት ኣፍሪካ ዝተገብረ መደብ ካብ'ቶም ዋና መዕረፊ ሓደ ነይሩ"" (Henry Lewis Gates' PBS Wonders of Africa series featured it as one of its main locations). This implies Timbuctoo *is* a significant and known city.

* **The text states:** "" ናይ  ዓረብ ክኢላታት ስለ ዘለውዋ ምስተን ካልኦት ከተማታት እንትነፃፀር ኣዝያ ፍልይ ዝበለት እያ"" (Because of its many Arab experts, it was very different from other cities).  This indicates a strong Arab influence.

* **The text says:** ""ብድኽነት ዝተሃርመ እዩ"" (It is impoverished). This is a direct statement in the text.

* **The text says:** ""ካብ ካልእ ክፋል ሃገር ንላዕሊ ናይ ዓረብ ጽልዋ ኣለዎ"" (It has more Arab influence than other parts of the country). This is a direct statement in the text.

Therefore, option C contradicts the information provided in the text.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""ሎሚ ቲምቡክቱ ዋላ'ኳ ዘለዋ ዝና ናይ ቱሪዝም ማእኸል እንተገበራን መዕርፎ ኣየር እንተሃለዋን፣ ድኽነት ዝተጎናጸፈት ከተማ እያ።"" (Today, although Timbuctu has a reputation as a tourism hub and an airport, it is a city marked by poverty.) This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: እታ ከተማ ብነፋሪት ክትብጻሕ እትኽእል እያ (The city can be swept by sandstorms):** While the text mentions the threat of desertification due to sandstorms, it doesn't say the city *can* be swept by them in the present day. It focuses on the historical and current threat.
* **C: ካብ ኣብ ከባቢኣ ዝርከባ ከተማታት ዝወሓደ ኣፍሪቃዊ ጣዕሚ ኣለዋ (It has a unique African charm compared to neighboring cities):** The text states Timbuctu was different from other cities *because* of the large number of Arab skills its inhabitants possessed. It doesn't mention a general African charm compared to neighbors.
* **D: እታ ከተማ ድሕሪ ሕጂ በጻሕቲ ኣይትስሕብን (The city will not experience rain in the future):** The text discusses the threat of desertification, but doesn't make a definitive statement about the city never receiving rain again.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement based on the provided text."

The passage explicitly states: ""እቲ ፓራኦሊምፒክስ ካብ 24 ነሓሰ ክሳብ 5 መስከረም 2021 ክካየድ እዩ。"" which translates to ""The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021.""

The passage states that strong winds (usually 100-200 mph) are created by the downburst. This makes option A the most accurate answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: እቶም ዓምድታት ኣየር ክሽክርከሩ ምስ ጀመሩ (When the columns of air begin to rise):**  The passage mentions columns of air, but doesn't specify *when* the downburst occurs relative to the column's rise.
* **C: ካብ ደበናታት ህቦብላ እናወረደ ከሎ (When it descends from the clouds):** While the downburst originates in the clouds, the strength is directly related to the wind speed.
* **D: ድሕሪ መሬት ምትንካፍ (After hitting the ground):**  The downburst *becomes* a downburst *after* hitting the ground, but the strength of the downburst is determined by the wind speed *before* it hits the ground.

* **C: መሬት ድሕሪ ምትንካፎም ፋነል ይኾኑ (After hitting the ground, they become funnels):** The passage mentions they become ""ህቦብላ ንፋስ"" (dust devils) after hitting the ground, not funnels.
* **D: ኣየር ንደገ ዝደፍኡ ዝሽክርከር ዓምድታት እዮም (They are tall columns of air that rise):** The passage describes them as winds carrying particles, not simply rising columns of air.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that the best advice comes from citizens of the country you are visiting because they have a deeper understanding of the political situation, culture, and daily life.  They are less likely to be influenced by biases or comparisons with other places.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ካብ መንግስቲ ናይታ ዝበጽሕዋ ሃገር (From the government of the country you are visiting):** While governments can offer information, the passage warns that their advice might be biased and based on their own interests.
* **B: ኣብ ውሽጢ ኣማኻሪ ጉዕዞ ካብ ዝቐረቡ ኣረኣእያታት (Within the trajectory of approaching ideas):** This is vague and doesn't align with the passage's emphasis on local knowledge.
* **D: ካብ ናይ ገዛእ ርእሶም መንግስቲ (From their own government):** This is essentially the same as option A and carries the same risk of bias.

Here's why:

The text explains that advisors from outside a country should be careful not to present overly generalized or simplified narratives. They should avoid excessive volume and focus on detailed, nuanced information. Option B directly reflects this warning about presenting an ""excessively voluminous"" account of the political situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ዝተጸልወ ናይ ምስራዝ መድሕን** (Generalized Eastern medicine): While the text touches on cultural differences, it's not specifically about Eastern medicine.
*   **C: ዝተጸልወ መድሕን ጥዕና** (Generalized generalized medical treatment): Similar to A, this isn't the main point of the text. The text is about political advice.
*   **D: ንፖለቲካዊ ኩነታት እታ ሃገር ብዝምልከት ዝርዝር ሓበሬታ** (Detailed information about the country's political situation): The text *does* advocate for detailed information, but it cautions against it being *excessive*. Therefore, option B is a more accurate representation of the text's warning.

Here's why:

The text states that travel agencies often specialize in trips to less common countries with different cultures and languages. It specifically mentions that agencies often provide good writing about these trips, focusing on nature, language, or less developed countries.  Therefore, a trip involving a language barrier aligns directly with the agencies' specialization and the type of trips they highlight.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: እቲ ተጓዓዛይ ቅድሚ ሕጂ ኣብ ዝበጽሖ ከተማ ናብ ናይ ስራሕ ዋዕላ ዝግበር ጉዕዞ (A trip the traveler has previously taken to a work conference in a city they have visited before):** This is a common type of trip and doesn't highlight the specialization of agencies in less common locations.
* **B: ኣዝዩ ፍሉይ ባጀት ዘለዎ ናይ ክልተ ሰሙን ነዊሕ ጉዕዞ (A very expensive two-week trip):**  While agencies *might* handle expensive trips, the text doesn't emphasize budget as a primary specialization.
* **D: ሓደ ተጓዓዛይ ንመጀመርታ ግዜ ናብ ወጻኢ ሃገር ዝገበሮ ጕዕዞ (A trip a traveler is taking abroad for the first time):**  While agencies *might* help first-time travelers, the text emphasizes trips to *less common* countries, not necessarily trips specifically for first-timers.



"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ሓደ ተጓዓዛይ ኣብ ኣየናይ ኵነታት እዩ ብሓገዝ ወኪል መገሻ ዝያዳ ተጠቃሚ ዝኸውን?,"The correct answer is **B: እቲ ተጓዓዛይ ንመጀመርታ ግዜ ፍሉይ ዑደት ክሕዝ ምስ ዝደሊ (The traveler when planning an unusual trip for the first time.)**

Here's why:

The text states that many agencies specialize in unusual trips to lesser-known countries, providing good guidance for travelers going on such journeys.  It also mentions that these agencies often have expertise in specific aspects like budget travel or particular locations.

Therefore, a traveler planning an *unusual trip for the first time* would most benefit from an agency with expertise in those specific areas because they need guidance and assistance navigating unfamiliar territory. Options A, C, and D don't directly align with the benefit of specialized guidance for an *unusual* trip, particularly for a first-time traveler.



"
ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ሓደ ተጓዓዛይ ሓደስቲ ቦታታት ኣብ ዝበጽሕሉ እዋን ተስፋ ንኸይቖርጽ ክሕግዞ ዝኽእል እንታይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **D: ኣቐዲምካ ኣብ መዕረፊ ቦታታት ዝምልከት ዝግበር መጽናዕቲ ምውጋድ (Studying beforehand about the places you're going to).**

Here's why:

The passage states that navigating new places involves understanding things like infrastructure, laws, food, traffic, knowledge, and language. It emphasizes the importance of being aware of how things are organized in a new environment. 

Option D directly addresses this by suggesting that researching and learning about the new places beforehand will help the traveler understand and adapt to the differences, making them less likely to feel overwhelmed and lose hope.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ምስቲ ዝመጸሉ ተመሳሳሊ መለክዒታት ምጽባይ (Trying to find similar cues to what you're used to):**  While helpful in some situations, relying solely on familiar cues won't prepare someone for truly new and different environments.
* **B: ዘይትፈልጦም መግብታት ክትፍትን ድልውነት (Trying to invent solutions to unknown problems):** This is a reactive approach. It's better to proactively gather information.
* **C: ነቲ ሕጊ ልክዕ ከምቲ ዝመጽሉ ከባቢ ምስዓብ (When the law becomes similar to the surrounding area):** The passage implies that this might *not* happen. New places often have different laws and norms.

Here's why:

The passage states that when traveling abroad, it's important to remember things that are different from what you're used to. It mentions various aspects like customs, laws, food, traffic, knowledge, stairs, language, etc.  Bringing *change* implies disrupting the established order, challenging norms, and potentially causing friction or problems in a new environment.  A person who brings change is more likely to encounter difficulties and misunderstandings.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: ፍሉይ መግቢ ዝፈቱ ሰብ (Someone who prepares special meals):**  This is a cultural difference, but less likely to cause significant danger or problems compared to someone who introduces broader changes.
* **C: ዕጹው ኣእምሮ ዘለዎ ሰብ (Someone with a sharp mind):**  A sharp mind is generally an asset, not a liability, in navigating new situations.
* **D: ትምህርቲ ዘሐጉሶ ሰብ (Someone who values learning):**  Valuing learning makes someone more adaptable and less prone to problems in a new environment.



Therefore, the person most likely to face challenges when traveling abroad is someone who introduces significant change and disrupts the existing environment.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically warns about unfamiliar animals potentially hiding or crawling on the ground. Checking for them *before* sleeping is a crucial safety precaution.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct answers to the question:

* **B: ኣብተን ቀዳሞት ሒደት መዓልታትኩም መግቢ ካብ ምብዛሕ ተቖጠቡ (Save on food for the following days):** While saving money is good, it's not a primary safety or cultural advice related to a first trip to a new country, as described in the passage.
* **C: ካምፕ ትገብሩ እንተኾይንኩም ዓራት ወይ ሃሞክ ምሓዝ ይምከር (It's advisable to bring a camp jacket or a sleeping bag to protect from insects and cold if you camp):** This is good advice for camping but not specifically what the passage highlights as a general first-time visitor precaution.
* **D: መጀመርታ ኣብ ዝመጻእኹሉ እዋን ኣብ ጽሬት ዘለዎ ሆቴል መዕራፍ (Stay in a comfortable hotel when you first arrive):** This relates more to initial comfort than to safety or cultural adaptation, which the passage focuses on.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that people new to a country often think that adopting Western-style food, hotels, and other customs will help the area develop. The passage also mentions that locals might not be used to animals in unfamiliar areas.

Option A directly reflects this point – the idea of introducing Western-style food is presented as something newcomers often consider for ""development."" The passage doesn't mention a lack of service (B), camping gear (C), or fancy hotels (D) as things that are *unhelpful* or ineffective. It frames the adoption of Western food as a potentially misguided attempt at development.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions saving a copy of the insurance policy on a laptop or tablet's memory if you are traveling without internet. This directly addresses the scenario of a virtual policyholder who might not have internet access.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ንሓደ ብጻይ መገሻ ቅዳሕ ምሃብ (Giving a backup copy of the policy):** While beneficial, this doesn't address the core issue of *how* someone without internet access can *obtain* a copy.  It assumes they already have one.
* **B: ንባዕሎም ቅዳሕ ብኢመይል ምልኣኽ (Sending the policy to their email):**  This is impossible if they lack internet access.
* **D: ቅዳሕ ኣብ “ክላውድ” ምኽዛን (Saving the policy in ""the cloud""):** This requires internet access.

Therefore, saving the policy on a laptop's memory is the only option that directly solves the problem of accessing a virtual policy without internet connectivity.

ብመሰረት እቲ ጥቕሲ፡ ካብዚ ዝስዕብ ኣየናይ እዩ ኣብቲ ፖሊሲ ምርኣይ ዘየድልዮ?,"The correct answer is **A: ክሲ ንምቕራብ ዝሕግዙ ዓለምለኻውያን ቁጽሪ ተሌፎናት (International phone numbers to contact in case of an emergency).**

Here's why:

The text explicitly instructs you to note the insurance company's email address and international phone numbers for emergencies. It also advises you to copy these details and keep them in multiple places (digital and physical).  The text *doesn't* say you need to note the international phone numbers to *contact* in case of an emergency - it's for *emergency contact*.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ናይ’ቲ መድሕን ዝህብ ኢመይል ኣድራሻ (The insurance company's email address):**  The text *does* instruct you to note the email address.
* **C: ፍቓድ ንምርካብ ዓለምለኻዊ ቁጽሪ ተሌፎን (International phone numbers to contact in case of an emergency):** The text *does* explicitly instruct you to note these numbers.
* **D: ናይቲ ወናኒ ፖሊሲ ኢመይል ኣድራሻ (The policy's email address):** The text instructs you to note the insurance company's email address, which is used for the policy.

The passage explicitly states: ""እቲ ኣብነታዊ 35mm ፊልም(36 ብ24mm ኣሉታዊ) ኣዝዩ ልሙድ እዩ..."" which translates to ""The conventional 35mm film (36 by 24mm negative) is very common...""

Therefore, 36 x 24mm is the most commonly used film format among the options.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""מስ'ቲ እዋናዊ DSLR ብገምጋም ዝወዳደር ጽሬት ስእሊ ይህብ"" which translates to ""which gives an image that is comparable to an era DSLR"".  It also mentions 35mm film was commonly used and could easily be obtained during shortages.  The passage explicitly states it provides an image comparable to a DSLR.

While the other options have higher resolution, the question asks which is *comparable* to a DSLR in terms of image quality (retinal). The passage directly links 35mm film to that comparison.

Here's why:

The passage states the goal is to start a travel blog *by creating a travel blog and website*.  Option C, ""Running your own website,"" is the culmination of that process. It's the actual realization of the initial idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ቅርጺ መርበብ ሓበሬታ ምልምማድ (Creating a content feed):**  This is a step *towards* having a website, but not the final goal.

Here's why:

Before you can start writing and publishing travel content, you need a place to *host* that content.  Creating a blog platform (like WordPress, Blogger, etc.) is the foundational first step. You need a website before you can start creating content for it.

Here's why the other options are not the *first* step:

* **A: ብሎጊንግ (Blogging):** This is the *activity* of writing blog posts. You can't blog without a platform.
* **C: ኣርትዖት ምግባር (Editing):** You need content *to* edit.

Here's why:

The text states that "" ኣብ ሙቅ ከባቢታት ባክተርያ ብቑልጡፍ ስለዝራባሕን ዝዓቢን ካብ ሰውነትና ወፃኢ ንነዊሕ ግዜ ምፅናሕ ይኽእል እዩ። ስለ'ዚ ናይ ደልሂ ከብዲ መቅዘፍትይ ፣ ናይ ፈርኦን መርገም ፣ ሞንቴዙማ ፍዳ ከምኡውን ናይ ብዙሕ ኧዕሩክቶም። ኣብ ዝሑል ጸባይ ኣየር ናይ እስትፋስ ጸገም ፣ኣብ ውዕይ ጽባይ ኣየር ናይ መዓናጡ ጸገም ብጣዕሚ ዝተለመዱ እዮም ።"" (In warm environments, bacteria multiply rapidly and for a long time outside the body. Therefore, pneumonia, the mummification of Pharaohs, Montezuma's fruit, and many tumors are common. In cold air, asthma problems; in stale air, bronchitis problems are extremely common.)

This clearly links problems with the respiratory system (asthma and bronchitis) to the likelihood of rapid bacterial growth and infection.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: ጸገማት መዓንጣ (Ear problems):** While ear infections are possible, the text doesn't directly connect rapid bacterial growth to ear problems.
*   **B: ናይ ከባቢ ጀርምታት (Local germs):** The text doesn't specifically focus on *local* germs, but rather on bacteria multiplying in *warm* and *stale* environments.
*   **D: ደልሂ ከብዲ (Pneumonia):** Pneumonia is mentioned as a consequence of bacterial growth, but the question asks about the *cause* of rapid growth, not a specific outcome.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** "" ኣብዚ ከባቢ ክሳብ ዘለካ ዶባት ብዘይ መለለይ ማንነትን ኬላታት ክትመሓላለፍ ትኽእል ኢኻ"" which translates to ""In this area, you can travel without border checks without revealing your identity and customs."" This implies a simplified process.
* **The text also states:** ""ናይ ሽንገን ቪዛ ብምሓዝ ንነፍሲ-ወከፍ ሽንገን ኣባል ሃገራት ቪዛ ነንበይኑ ምምልካት ኣየድልዮምን'ዩ, ስለዝኾነ እውን ግዜ, ገንዘበን ናይ ወረቐት ስራሕን ይቑጥቡ እዮም"" which translates to ""By having a Schengen visa, you don't need to extend your visa to other Schengen member countries, as time, money, and paperwork are also checked."" This again points to ease of travel within the Schengen zone.
* **Now let's analyze the options:**
    * **A: ተደጋገምቲ ናይ ቪዛ ሕቶታት ምውጋድ (Repeated visa questions):** While some visa questions *might* be asked, the overall process is simplified compared to non-Schengen travel. So, repeated questions aren't a defining characteristic of the advantage.
    * **B: ገንዘብ ምቑጣብ (Money check):** Money checks *are* still performed, although the text implies they are less burdensome.
    * **C: ካብ ብዙሓት ናይ ፓስፖርት ቁጽጽር ቦታታት ምውጋድ (Check from many passport number locations):** The text clearly states that passport checks are *not* a requirement.
    * **D: ፓስፖርት ዘድልዮ ኣይኮነን (Passport is not required):** This is incorrect. A passport *is* required to enter the Schengen zone. The simplification lies in *not* having border checks and simplified procedures *after* entering the zone with a valid passport and visa.

Therefore, the primary advantage highlighted in the text is the absence of border checks and simplified procedures after entering the Schengen zone with a valid passport and visa, **not the passport itself being unnecessary.**

This indicates that the head is visible, but the text also mentions that the mummy's remains have been moved to a museum in Cairo.  Therefore, you can no longer see the mummy's head *at the tomb itself*.  The other options are less directly supported by the text.

Additionally, it can be easily reached by taxi from downtown Vancouver to Granville Island.)

While Granville Island is mentioned as being reachable from Vancouver, the text highlights Bowen Island's proximity to Vancouver and ease of access.  The passage emphasizes Bowen Island as a destination for various activities. The other options (Granville Island, the Skywalk, and Whistler) are mentioned as attractions *on* or *near* Bowen Island, but Bowen Island itself is the location being described as a travel destination.

Therefore, Bowen Island is the place where Vancouver residents are seeking travel experiences.

The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island offers a range of activities like kayaking, hiking, exploring shops, and dining, making it a great place for a day trip or weekend getaway to experience authentic Vancouver. While Whistler and Granville Island are mentioned, the passage highlights Bowen Island's diverse offerings for a genuine Vancouver experience."

This directly indicates that travelers who want to see the most spectacular view of the waterfall should visit **between November and February**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ኣብ እዋን ወቲ በጻሕቲ** (During the dry season): The passage says the view isn't as impressive during the dry season.
* **C: መጠን ማይ ልዑል ኣብ ዝኾነሉ እዋን** (When the water level is high): While the passage mentions a high water level, it specifies *when* it's high – during the rainy seasons.
* **D: ካብ ናይ ዝናብ ወቕቲ ወጻኢ** (Outside the rainy season): This is incorrect because the passage explicitly states the rainy season (November-February) offers the best view.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding and obtaining the necessary permissions *before* filming, especially when using drones. Option A directly aligns with this core message.  It highlights the need to investigate what kind of permissions are needed before starting to film.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: ተወሳኺ ፍቓድ ምርካብ (Obtaining additional permissions):** While sometimes necessary, the passage focuses on understanding the *initial* requirements.
*   **C: ፍቓድ ምምርማር (Circumventing permissions):** This is explicitly discouraged by the passage, which highlights the risks of filming without proper authorization.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of obtaining permission *before* filming, especially when using a drone. Option D directly aligns with this principle. The passage states you should ""acquire permission beforehand and confirm it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ ጥቓ’ቲ ብህላወ ናይ’ታ ድሮን(ሰብ ኣልቦ ነፋሪት) ዘይርበሽ ህዝቢ** (In the vicinity of a place where there is no crowd of people): While avoiding crowds is good practice, it doesn't address the permission issue.
* **B: ስሩዕ ፎቶ ግራፍ ምልዓል ኣብ ዘይፍቀደሉ ከባቢታት** (Drone photography in areas where it is not permitted): This is the opposite of what the passage advises.
* **C: ኣብ እታ ሰብ ኣልቦ ነፋሪት ብዙሕ ዘይትርአ ጽዑቕ ቦታታት** (In those quiet places where there is not much movement of people): Again, avoiding movement is good, but the core message is about permission.

The text explicitly states the opposite: ""ምዝገባ ኣብ ናይ ቪዛ መስርሕ ተወሳኺ ኣድላይነት ዘለዎ ካልእ ነገር እዩ። ኣብ ገለ ሃገራት፡ ህላውነትካን ትጸንሓሉ ቦታን ምስ ናይ ውሽጢ ዓዲ ሰብ መዚ ምምዝጋብ ግዴታ እዩ።"" (Registration is something else that requires additional benefit in visa processing. In some countries, it is mandatory to register your residence and your location with an inland person).  This means **not all countries** require registration in local authorities. The text clarifies that it's only mandatory in *some* countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ኣብ መዕረፊ በጻሕቲ ትሓድሩ እንተኾይንኩም፡ ምምዝጋብ ከየድልየኩም ይኽእል’ዩ (If you are staying in a hostel, you may not be required to register).** This aligns with the text, which states that only those staying in certain types of accommodations (like hostels) might not be required to register.
* **C: ናብ ቤት ጽሕፈታት ኢሚግሬሽን ምብጻሕ ከድሊ ይኽእል እዩ (You may need to go to the immigration office).** The text mentions going to the immigration office (""ናብ ቤት ጽሕፈታት ኢሚግሬሽን ምብጻሕ ከድሊ ይኽእል እዩ""), so this is a possible option.
* **D: ኣብ ገለ ቦታታት ድማ ኣብቲ ከባቢ ዝርከቡ ሆቴላት ነቲ ምዝገባ ክሕዝዎ ይኽእሉ (In some places, it is possible to submit registration to the hotels located in the area).**  The text explicitly states this ("" ኣብ ገለ ቦታታት ድማ ኣብቲ ከባቢ ዝርከቡ ሆቴላት ነቲ ምዝገባ ክሕዝዎ ይኽእሉ""), so this is correct.



Therefore, option **B** is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the text.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states that local hotels are often required to register guests.** 
* **The passage says that the local post office is NOT typically a place for mandatory registration for visitors.** The passage focuses on hotels as the primary location for this kind of registration.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible:

* **A: ኣብቲ ከባቢ ዝርከብ መደበር ፖሊስ (Local Police Station):** Police stations are often involved in immigration matters and may require registration in certain situations.
* **B: እቲ ዝሓድሩሉ ዘለዉ ሆቴል (The Hotel They Are Staying In):** The passage explicitly mentions hotels as places where registration is commonly required.
* **D: እተን ኣብያተ ጽሕፈት ኢሚግሬሽን (Immigration Offices):** Immigration offices are the primary authority for immigration matters and are definitely a place where registration would occur.

Therefore, the local post office is the only option not mentioned as a typical registration location in the text."
ኣብ ጕዕዞ ብወለንታዊ ስራሕ ዘይጥቀም መን ኣሎ?,"The correct answer is **B: ርኡይ ደሞዝ ዝደሊ ሰብ (Someone who values high salaries)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that volunteering in development work is a good way to:

*   Expand horizons.
*   Promote local culture.
*   Help new people.
*   Learn about the world.
*   Develop new skills.
*   It's also cost-effective because of the flexibility of work and lower salaries.

Option B, ""ርኡይ ደሞዝ ዝደሊ ሰብ"" (Someone who values high salaries), directly contradicts the passage's point about lower salaries being a benefit of volunteer work. The passage highlights the *lack* of a high salary as a factor making it accessible and affordable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ኣብ ወጻኢ ሃገር እናሃለወ ሓደስቲ ኣዕሩኽ ክረክብ ተስፋ ዝገብር ሰብ (Someone who hopes to gain new experiences while traveling)** - This aligns with the passage's point about expanding horizons.
*   **C: ሓድሽ ክእለት ከጥርይ ተስፋ ዝገበረ ሰብ (Someone who hopes to learn new skills)** - This aligns with the passage's point about developing new skills.
*   **D: ኣብ ክፍልን ሰሌዳን ተገዳስነት ክህልዎ ዝኽእል ሰብ (Someone who can be flexible with schedules)** - This aligns with the passage's point about the flexibility of work.

Therefore, the only option that doesn't fit the passage's positive portrayal of volunteer development work is someone primarily motivated by a high salary.

Here's why:

The passage states that volunteering abroad is a good way to ""open new opportunities, learn about us, offer ideas, and develop new skills.""  It also mentions that it involves ""many voluntary work sections and boards"" and ""small amounts of salary."" This suggests that while the work might not be highly paid, it can lead to employment opportunities.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: ዳርጋ ኩሉ ግዜ ደሞዝ ይወሃብ (The government always provides salary):** The passage explicitly says ""small amounts of salary,"" not ""always salary.""
*   **C: ሓደ ሓደ ግዜ ክፍልን ሰሌዳን ይቐርብ እዩ (It occasionally brings sections and boards together):** While it *can* happen, the passage doesn't highlight this as the primary benefit.
*   **D: ናይ ኣረኣእያ ስምዒት ንኽህልወኩም ክሕግዝ ይኽእል እዩ (It can help you manage your attitude):**  This is a secondary benefit mentioned, not the most significant one for a traveler with a budget.

Here's why:

The passage describes a typical Walt Disney World trip as involving staying at a Disney hotel, driving to the park, and using the Disney transportation system. Option B directly reflects this detail: staying at a hotel *outside* the park is still part of the overall experience, as you'd then need to travel to the park each day.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ንሓደ ሰሙን ኣብ መናፈሻታት ብምድህሳስ ምሕላፍ** (Spending a day visiting the parks) - This is *part* of the trip, but not the entire *central* experience described.
*   **C: ምሉእ እቲ ጉዕዞ ኣብ ንብረት ዲዝኒ ምሕላፍ** (Spending the entire trip visiting Disney property) - While the trip involves Disney property, the passage focuses more on the hotel and transportation aspects, not just being *on* the property.
*   **D: ካብ መዓርፎ ነፈርቲ ናብ ሆቴል ብኣውቶቡስ ምኻድ** (Traveling from the park at night to the hotel by bus) - This is a *detail* of the transportation, not the central experience of the trip.

Here's why:

* **Walt Disney World Resort is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company.**  It's not something Walt Disney personally *owned* in the sense of a private property he held. It was a company endeavor.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true:

* **A: ፓርክ-ሆፐር ትኬት ናብ ካልኦት ተጓዓዝቲ ይተሓላለፍ (Park-hopper tickets can be transferred to other guests):** This is true. Park-hopper tickets often have transferability options.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions:**  ""ሓደ መደብ ትምህርቲ ን2-5 መዓልታት ዝቅጽል ኮይኑ、 ተዋስኦ、 ብዙሕ ናይ ቀዳማይ ረድኤትን ገለ እዋን ድማ ናይ ጠበንጃ ስልጠና የጠቓልል"" (A language course is 2-5 days long, immersive, with a lot of initial support and some practical training).  This implies practical training *is* included.
* **The text mentions:** ""ብዛዕባ ኩናት ቦታታት ዝፅብፅቡ ሕታማት ግን ውሑዳት እዮም።"" (Although textbooks about current locations are common, there are few regarding combat environments). This suggests specialized training exists for combat environments.
* **Fieldcraft (ምድሓን በረኻ)** is a core element of combat environment training – it involves techniques for moving and operating in a battlefield safely and effectively.  The text doesn't mention this specific skill.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ድልውነት ቀዳማይ ረድኤት (Initial First Aid):** The text specifically states ""ብዙሕ ናይ ቀዳማይ ረድኤት"" (a lot of initial support), so this is mentioned.
* **C: ድልውነት ዞባ ውግእ (Combat Zone Location):** The text mentions textbooks are *limited* regarding combat zone locations, suggesting training *does* address this.
* **D: ተራ ምጽዋት (Basic Shooting):** While practical training is mentioned, basic shooting isn't specifically listed as an element of the language course. However, it's a common part of combat training and arguably *could* be included in the ""some practical training"" mentioned. But, fieldcraft is more directly relevant to navigating the battlefield, and its absence is a clearer omission.



Therefore, **Fieldcraft (ምድሓን በረኻ)** is the most clearly missing element from the described language course.

Here's why:

The passage states that a hostile environment course includes "" ብዙሕ ናይ ቀዳማይ ረድኤት"" (a lot of first aid). Given the context of a dangerous conflict zone, first aid is the most immediately crucial skill for someone to possess. While the other options (zones of conflict, wilderness navigation, and counter-IED) are important, they are secondary to the immediate need to treat injuries in a potentially life-threatening situation.  Therefore, first aid is the most relevant and highly prioritized skill for this type of professional training.

Here's why:

The passage states that the optimal boiling time for water varies depending on location and the water's initial quality. It mentions that in some areas, boiling for just a minute is sufficient, while in others it requires several minutes.  It also criticizes companies that sell bottled water with misleading claims.  The passage doesn't recommend any of the other options.  Boiling water for 10 minutes is a common and generally recommended practice for purification, aligning with the passage's emphasis on different boiling times depending on circumstances.

Here's why:

The passage states that the current (water) pushes against the motors, making it difficult to create a whirlpool.  However, by moving *against* the current (ኣንጻር ውሕጅ), the whirlpool can be created and sustained.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ምስ ሪፍ ብቐረባ ምሕንባስ (Moving closely to a reef):** While a reef *could* potentially influence water flow, the passage doesn't mention this as a key factor.
*   **B: ኣብ ዓሚቝ ማይ ምሕንባስ (Moving in deep water):** The depth of the water isn't mentioned as a critical factor in the passage.
*   **D: ኣብ ከባቢ ማዕበል ምሕንባስ (Moving in the vicinity of a whirlpool):** This is illogical; you can't create a whirlpool by being *near* one.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where you've been swept away by a current. The advice given is to **swim in the opposite direction** of the current to escape it. Option C directly reflects this advice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ካብቲ ውሕጅ ናብ ካልእ ኣንፈት ብምዕላም ክትወጽኡ ፈትኑ; ድሕሪኡ ብንቡር ናብ ገምገም ባሕሪ ተመሊስኩም ምሕንባስ (Quickly swim away from the whirlpool to another place; then properly head towards the shore and swim.)** While heading towards the shore is the ultimate goal, the *immediate* action to escape the current is to swim *against* it.
*   **B: ኣንጻር እቲ ዋሕዚ ብቕልጡፍ ምሕንባስ (Swim rapidly against the whirlpool)** This is partially correct, but it doesn't specify *how* to swim against the current; it omits the direction.
*   **D: ኣብ ትሕቲ መሬት ምሕንባስ (Swim under the ground)** This is completely illogical and not a viable escape method.

Here's why:

The text states that visiting castles *within* the Rhine Valley, as well as castles on the Danube or Lake Constance by boat, are good things to do during religious holiday celebrations.  Option C directly reflects this statement. The other options are less specific or don't align with the text's examples.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that the women in this region are resourceful and prioritize their own thoughts and well-being. It also mentions that they avoid confrontation and are clever. Option A, advising them to avoid dangerous situations, doesn't align with the text's focus on strength, cleverness, and prioritizing self-interest. They are presented as women who can handle themselves and make their own choices, not necessarily avoid danger at all costs.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the text:

*   **B: ባህላዊ ፍልልያት ካብ ደቂ ዓዲ ሓያል ጠባይ ከለዓዕል ከም ዝኽእል ኣስተውዕሉ (Be careful that traditional customs don't weaken the women of the community)**: The text mentions customs that some women might find objectionable and that they have the power to reject them. This aligns with the advice to be cautious about customs.

*   **C: ብልጭ ዝብሉ ስልማት ካብ ምግባር ተቖጠቡ (Avoid using flashy tactics)**: The text suggests a preference for cleverness over showiness.

*   **D: ኣድላዪ ኣብ ዝኾነሉ እዋን ትሪነት ተጠቐሙ (Use cunning in times of need)**: The text highlights the women's cleverness and ability to make their own choices, which could involve using cunning.

Therefore, Option A is the only one that contradicts the overall message of the text."

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes female independence and critical thinking.** It states women should not blindly follow others and should prioritize their own judgment.
* **Option A directly reflects this emphasis.** It warns against being overly influenced by others, aligning with the passage's message of self-reliance.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: ንኹነታት ሓዳር ንምምልካት ዓቢ ቀለቤት ምግባር (Taking a big initiative to fulfill the marital situation):** While initiative can be positive, the passage doesn't strongly advocate for always taking the lead. It focuses on thoughtful decision-making.
* **C: ምርዳእ ባህላዊ ፍልልያት ኣብ መርገጺኹም ደው ካብ ምባል ከም ዝሕብር ተረድኡ (Understand that choosing traditional customs can prevent you from being criticized):** The passage explicitly *discourages* blindly following traditions without critical thought.
* **D: ኣብ እዋን ዘይተደልየ ምዕባለታት፡ ንደቂ ተባዕትዮ ኣብ ምንጻግ ጽኑዓት ኩና (Be persistent with your husband in situations that are not resolved):**  Persistence is good, but the passage's primary focus isn't on marital dynamics or resolving conflicts. It's on female autonomy.



Therefore, Option A is the most aligned with the main message of the passage.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations when photographing wild animals. It states that photographing wild animals, especially their cubs, for commercial purposes often requires new telephoto lenses. It also highlights the potential danger of wild animals and the legal protections surrounding them.

Option A directly addresses this central theme.  The passage focuses on the specific scenario of photographing *wild* animals, particularly their cubs, making option A the most relevant and accurate answer based on the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: እቶም ፎቶ ንንግዳዊ ዕላማ ዝውዕሉ እንተኾይኖም (Those photos that are for charitable purposes):** While the passage touches on ethical considerations, it doesn't primarily focus on charitable photography.
* **C: እቶም ዝስኣሉ ዘለዉ እንስሳታት ሓፋር እንተኾይኖም (Those animals that are not endangered):** The passage *does* mention endangered animals and their cubs, making this option incomplete. It doesn't address the ethical implications for non-endangered animals.
* **D: ሓደ ፓርክ ብዛዕባ ፎቶ መልዓሊ ንዱር ሂወት ፍሉይ ሕግታት እንተሃልይዎ (A park that has implemented special photography rules for wildlife):**  The passage mentions rules and laws but doesn't focus on the specific situation of a park implementing those rules. It's too general.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of respect, patience, and ethical considerations when photographing wildlife. It explicitly states that disturbing animals can be harmful and that photographing breeding animals requires strict laws. Creating a hostile environment for animals directly contradicts these ethical guidelines and is therefore the most inappropriate option.

Let's look at why the other options *could* be part of a successful wildlife photo:

* **A: ገለ ፍሉያት እንስሳታት ምርካብ (Photographing rare animals):**  Rare animals are often sought after by photographers due to their uniqueness.
* **B: ምስ ዕጡቓት እንስሳታት ምግጣም (Getting close to animals):** Getting close allows for more intimate and detailed shots.
* **C: ምንጪ ናይቲ ዘድሊ ዓይነት ሌንስ ምርካብ (Using the appropriate type of lens):**  Using the right lens is crucial for achieving the desired perspective and image quality, especially for distant subjects.

Here's why:

The passage describes issues with visibility due to:

*   **Dust/debris in the air:** This reduces visibility, making it difficult to see.
*   **Dirty windshields:** Similar to dust, a dirty windshield obstructs the driver's view.
*   **Fog:** This is also a common cause of reduced visibility.
*   **Dirt or water on vehicle windows:** This also blocks the driver's view.

**Overshading** is a direct cause of reduced visibility, especially at night or in low-light conditions. The passage explicitly mentions that dusty or foggy conditions can make it difficult to see, and overshading would have a similar effect.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: ብርቱዕ ምንቅስቓስ (Traffic Congestion):** Traffic congestion primarily causes delays, not necessarily reduced visibility. While congestion can create stressful situations, it isn't directly linked to visual obstruction.
*   **B: ትሑት ፍሕፍሐ (Low Visibility):** While low visibility is a problem, it is a *result* of something (dust, fog, etc.) rather than a *cause* of a problem *for a driver*. The passage describes how low visibility occurs. 
*   **D: ምጉዳል ርኡይነት (Obstructed Vision):** Obstructed vision is a general term, and while overshading *causes* obstructed vision, the specific term in the options that best fits the context of the passage is ""overshading"".



Therefore, **C** is the most relevant and accurate answer based on the provided passage."

Here's why:

The passage states that the *amount* and *structure* of royalties vary from country to country.  This directly relates to the **prices** that are paid for the right to use the intellectual property.  The other options are less directly related:

*   **B: መዋቕር (Cost/Expenses):** While costs might be involved in managing royalties, it's not the primary variation described in the text.
*   **C: ፋይል እትገብሩሉ ቦታ (File location):** Where a file is stored doesn't relate to royalty agreements.
*   **D: ብራኬትስ (Brackets):** Brackets are irrelevant to royalty agreements.

Therefore, the variation in **prices** is the most directly linked to the varying royalty structures in different countries, as stated in the passage."

Here's why:

The passage states that the taxation of income earned abroad depends on the laws of the country where the income is earned.  It also mentions that in federal countries like the US and Canada, income tax can be divided based on location.

Therefore, the most logical answer is that you would declare your income tax in the country where the work is being performed (where the income is earned). While there might be implications for where you *reside*, the primary tax obligation is typically tied to the source of the income.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: መብዛሕትኡ ግዜ ኣብ እትነብረሉ ቦታ (Most of the time in the place where you reside):** While your residency *might* affect your overall tax situation, it doesn't necessarily mean you'd declare income tax there.
* **B: ኣብ ኣሜሪካ (In America):** This is too specific. The passage mentions the US as an example of a federal country, but doesn't say you *must* declare income tax in America.
* **D: ክፍሊታት ዝወሓደ ኣብ ዝኾነሉ ቦታ (Divided portions in any location):**  While income can be divided, the passage doesn't suggest you declare portions in *any* location. The income is taxed based on the source.

    * **A: ምርኢታት ታሪኽ ሓንቲ ሃገርን ጉዳያት ዓለምን ዘርኢ ክኸውን ኣለዎ (Expos should showcase the history of one country and global issues).** While expos *do* showcase a country, they also focus on global themes and issues. This statement is too narrow.
    * **C: ፍጻመታት ክሳብ ሽዱሽተ ወርሒ ክጸንሑ ኣለዎም (Events should last up to six months).** The text says the events typically last 3 to 5 months. This statement is incorrect.
    * **D: እቲ ምርኢት ንኽካየድ ኩለን ሃገራት ክሳተፋ ኣለወን (The expo does not require all countries to participate).** While participation isn't mandatory, the text doesn't state that *all* countries are excluded. It just describes the general nature of the expo.

ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ኣየናይ ምግባር እዩ ንናይ እንስሳታት መጥቃዕቲ ተኽእሎ ዝቕንስ?,"The correct answer is **A: ምኡዝ ሽታ ዘለዎ ዕሸል ምሓዝ (Feeding wild animals with stale bread)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that feeding wild animals with stale bread is prohibited and that it is important not to tempt them. Option A directly addresses this prohibited action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ካብ መዓስከር ጓሓፍ ምእላይ (Avoiding approaching from the back)**: This is good practice for safety, but doesn't directly impact the animals' ability to become accustomed to humans.
* **C: ካብ ኣዛብእ ናይ 25 ሜትሮ ርሕቀት ምሕላው (Maintaining a distance of 25 meters from the water)**: This is a safety precaution related to water, and while important, isn't specifically about habituation.
* **D: ንእንስሳታት ብናይ መግቢ ቁርጽራጽ ምድኻም (Avoiding crowding animals with food)**: This is good practice for safety and to prevent aggressive behavior, but the text emphasizes *not* feeding them at all to prevent habituation.

Therefore, the only action directly related to encouraging wild animals to become accustomed to humans (and therefore increasing the risk of conflict) is feeding them."
ካብዞም ዝስዕቡ ጠንቅታት መጥቃዕቲ ናይ ዱር እንስሳት ክኸውን ከም ዝኽእል ዘይተጠቕሰ ኣየናይ እዩ?,"The correct answer is **B: ርሕቀት ምሕላው ዘይምኽኣል (Failure to maintain distance)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that maintaining a distance is crucial for safety. It says to stay 100 yards from dangerous animals like bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wild animals. Failing to maintain this distance puts both the person and the animal at risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ብርቱዕ ሽታ (Loud noise):** While loud noises can startle animals, the passage doesn't mention them as a way to prevent encounters. It focuses on distance.
* **C: ንእንስሳ ዘገዳም ምምጋብ (Provoking animals):** The passage advises against provoking animals, which aligns with the importance of distance. However, failing to maintain distance *is* a form of provocation.
* **D: ምስ ሰብ ዘይቀራረቡ እንስሳታት (Animals that don't socialize with humans):** This is irrelevant to preventing encounters. The danger comes from wild animals, regardless of their social habits.



Therefore, the most directly contradictory point to the passage's advice is failing to maintain a safe distance.
