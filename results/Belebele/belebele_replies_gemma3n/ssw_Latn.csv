"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lebeyingeke itsatfwe njenge thiphu lekungiyo yekudlala ngemphumelelo inkositini?","The correct answer is **C: Caphela kushaya emanothi ngalesikhatsi ubambe sandla lesikhululekile.**

Here's why:

The text emphasizes relaxed hands for generating power in drumming. Option C directly reflects this advice.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **A:**  The text explicitly states *not* to use excessive force or arm strength.
* **B:** While conserving energy is good, the core of the text is about utilizing relaxed hands and foot technique.
* **D:**  The text emphasizes *controlled* foot movement, not just high speed.

Therefore, the best answer aligns with the principle of relaxed hands and focuses on the correct way to hold the sticks.
"
"Uma udlala inkositini, ngukuphi lokutawusita kukhulisa Ivolomu?","The correct answer is **A: Sivinini lesingetiwe (Uneven striking)**.

Here's why:

The text states that to increase volume on the organ, you don't need to press hard. Instead, you need to use feet or fingers that strike with a lot of *unevenness* or speed. This implies that the *uneven striking* is what generates volume, not simply the force of the strike. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Emandla langetiwe (Uneven force):** While uneven force contributes, the text emphasizes speed or a particular striking technique over simply uneven force.
* **C: Kucindzetela lokuphasi (Pressing strength):**  The text specifically says *don't* use a lot of pressing strength.
* **D: Kunyangata kwemunwe lokuphasi (Finger strike):** This is too specific. The text mentions using feet *or* fingers.  The concept of uneven striking applies regardless of which part of your body you're using.



"
Kungani titfombe letikumabonakudze tijube imincele yato?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngako sitfombe sigcwalisa sikilini sonkhe**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Loko kubitwa ngekutsi kugcwalisa sitfombe esikrinini."" This translates to ""This is called filling the picture on the screen.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuvumela imibhalo lengaphasi:** While filling the frame *can* accommodate subtitles, it's not the primary reason for the effect. The text focuses on the visual aspect.
* **C: Kuvumela kugucula lokulula kwalamanye emafomathi:**  This is irrelevant to the visual phenomenon described.
* **D: Kujuba imibhalo lengaphasi dvutane kakhulu naphasi:** This is not the main purpose and doesn't align with the description in the text.



Therefore, the best explanation based on the provided text is that the frames are filled to encompass the entire screen.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngutiphi tinkinga kuleti letilandzelako umuntfu langahle ahlangabetane nato uma agucula ibhayisikobho ibe ifomethi ye-DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Imibhalo lephasi isikwe kancane**.

Here's why:

The first part of the text describes the challenges of converting films to DVD. It specifically mentions that if there are subtitles (words) too low on the screen, they won't look good on a DVD.

Therefore, the most likely consequence of converting a film to DVD, based on the provided text, is that the subtitles will be cropped (cut off or distorted) because the DVD format has different aspect ratios and space limitations compared to a TV screen.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Sitfombe lesingagcwali sikilini sonkhe (The picture doesn't fill the entire screen):** While aspect ratio differences *can* cause this, the text doesn't directly link DVD conversion to an empty screen.
*   **C: Sitfombe lesigcwala sikilini sonkhe (The picture fills the entire screen):** This is unlikely, as the text implies that maintaining a full screen isn't always possible.
*   **D: Juba imichele (The edges are distorted):**  While distortion *could* happen, cropped subtitles are a more directly stated problem in the text.



"
Belikuphi libutfo lemasotja aseBhrithani?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Bordentown**.

The passage states: ""Jenene John Cadwalder utawucalisa kuhlasela iBrithani eBordentown..."" This means the British troops were targeted in Bordentown.
"
Kwabani lokusayina lokuvele kulokusalungiswa lokubhalwe ngesandla?,"The correct answer is **A: Ya-John Dunlap**.

The passage states: ""Ikhophi yekucala leyabhalwa ngesandla yona ayisekho."" and also mentions that ""Kulobusuku emakhophi lasukela ku-150 kuya ku-200 entiwa, nyalo latiwa ngekutsi ngema-""""Dunlap broadsides""""."" This indicates that John Dunlap was the printer who created the initial printed copies, and therefore, the first printed copy (which was handwritten) is now lost.  The question asks who *signed* the document, not who *printed* it. The first line says that the document was signed by John Hancock and Charles Thomson.
"
"Kuletindzawo letilandzelako, kukuphi lapho i-Dunlap broadside yafika khona ekugcineni?","The correct answer is **C: e-London**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ikhophi yafika eLondon mhlaka-10 ngeNgci."" (A copy arrived in London on the 10th of July.)
"
Bewahlala kuphi emasotja a-Colonel Stark?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngasenyakatfo yempumalanga ye-peninsula**.

The text states: ""Emasotja aStark abegudle fenisi eme ngale kulelelinye live. Ngekhatsi kwehla kwemanti lokuphansi kuvula umsele kulomfula iMystic ngasenyakatfo-mphumalanga yePeninsula..."" This directly indicates the soldiers were located on the eastern side of the peninsula (east of the Mystic River).
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, emadvodza aStark alule dalada wawo?","The correct answer is **A: Ngalesikhatsi Emakholoni acela kuciniswa** (At the time the colonies were being invaded).

The passage states: ""Emawoja lacinisa letikhudla letiphambili ahlanganisa libutfo lekucala nelesitfatfu lemadvodza langema-200 aseNew Hampshire, laholwa boKholoneli John Stark naJames Reed (kamuva bobabili baba boGeneral)."" This means the troops were deployed *during* the invasion.

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **B: Ngemuva kwekutsi labajwayelekile bandlulise sigcobo** (After the regulars had crossed the border): The passage doesn't mention regulars crossing the border.
*   **C: Ngesikhatsi seligagazi lelincane** (During the small bloodshed): The passage describes a defensive setup, not an active battle with bloodshed.
*   **D: Ngalesikhatsi emasotja atsatsa tikhundla letiphambili** (When the soldiers dispersed their forward positions): The passage indicates the soldiers established a defensive line, not dispersed.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kwalokungulokunye kwetikhatsi teludlame kakhulu eChina?","The correct answer is **D: Sikhatsi Semibuso Lemitsatfu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""LeMibuso Lemitsatfu kubusa kwayo kwaba sikhatsi lokwacitseka ngaso kakhulu ingati emlandvweni waseShayina Ngesikhatsi Lesendlulile tinkhulungwane tebantfu tafa tilwela kuhlala etihlalweni letiphakeme eXi’an."" (The reign of the Sixteen Kingdoms was a particularly chaotic period in Chinese history, during which hundreds of thousands of people died fighting to control the highlands of Xi'an.)

This directly links the Sixteen Kingdoms period (Mibuso Lemitsatfu) with immense bloodshed and conflict. The other options are either not mentioned in the same context of widespread death and fighting, or are mentioned in a more general sense.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, liyini liciniso ngemasotja etintfutfwane letingena esigabeni sekuzulazula?","The correct answer is **A: Bahlala ebusuku (They sleep at night)**.

The text states: ""Tintfutfwane letilubutfo timasha ebusuku futsi time emini kuze tiphumule"" which translates to ""The young birds sleep at night and during the day to rest.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Banekudla lokuncane (They have little food):** While the text mentions the colony is conserved due to food scarcity during the day, it doesn't specifically say the birds *themselves* have little food.  It's about the colony's overall conservation effort.
* **C: Bakha tidleke letishintjwako ngemuva kwemalanga langu-17 (They build temporary shelters after day 17):** The text mentions temporary shelters but doesn't specify when they are built.
* **D: Bamasha emini (They are young in the morning):** The text states the young birds sleep at night.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende lesikhombisa ngalokungiko imikhuba yekuhlala kwemasotja etintfutfwane phakatsi nesigaba sekutilula?","The correct answer is **C: Bashintja tidleke wonkhe malanga**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kuba mnandzi kutsi nawuvakashela khona uphindze ugibele sikebhe lesiya esichingini.  **Kuba mnandzi, lekholoni yenta tilulu tesikhashana letishintjwako onkhe emalanga.**""  This directly translates to: ""When it's difficult to visit, the colony makes temporary changes every day.""  This refers to the soldiers' sleeping arrangements adapting daily.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakha tindleke ebusuku (They build shelters at night):** The passage mentions they sleep at night, but it doesn't say they *build* shelters every night.
* **B: Bamasha emalanga langu-17 ngaphandle kwekuhlala (They are new on the 17th day without sleeping):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Basebentisa tidleke letifanako ngesikhatsi sesigaba (They use the same shelters during the season):** The passage emphasizes that they change shelters *every day* when conditions are difficult.



"
Ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokutochubeka nangetulu kwekubakhona kwetimphawu tangaphandle?,"The correct answer is **A: Imijikeleto lengapheli (Endless cycles)**.

Here's why:

The text states that living organisms have internal biological clocks. These clocks continue to operate *even in the absence of external cues*. The question asks what happens next *beyond* the absence of external cues.  Since the biological clocks are internal and continue operating, the next stage is the continuation of these **endless cycles**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tigci tetikhatsi (Time spiral):** While time is relevant, the text is focusing on the *internal* biological processes, not a ""time spiral.""
* **C: Emawashi etintfo letiphilako (Water in living things):**  Water is a component of life, but the question is about the *process* that continues *because* of the internal clock.
* **D: Tigci letibukwako (Observable cycles):** The key here is that the cycles are *not* dependent on external cues. They continue even when we can't observe them externally.



"
Nguliphi ligama lelichaza bantfu labakhombisa kuhluka kwesici lesitsite se-phenotypic?,"The correct answer is **D: I-Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** means having many forms or variations. The question states that if people show variation in a trait, they are described as polymorphic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic** means having only one form. This is the opposite of what the question is asking about.
* **Tintfo letiphilako** translates to ""living things"" - it's a general term, not a specific description of variation.
* **Tinhlobo** translates to ""types"" or ""kinds"" - while related to variation, it doesn't specifically describe the *phenotypic* variation being discussed.



"
Nguliphi ligama lelifanele kulawa lalandzelako etintfo letiphilako letihlala endzaweni letsite?,"The correct answer is **D: I-Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** means having multiple forms or variations. The question states that when people show variation in the trait (color of the site), they are considered polymorphic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:** This means having only one form or variation. The question states the opposite – variation exists.
* **Linani lebantfu (Number of people):** This is irrelevant to the description of the trait variation.
* **Tinhlobo (Types):** While ""types"" could be related, it's not the specific scientific term used to describe variation in traits like this.  ""Polymorphic"" is the precise term in this context.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungeke kube sibonelo semsebenti wekuvakasha losuselwe tikwendalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Kutfwebula timbali tasendle (Trampling on plants in the forest)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes responsible ecotourism.** This means respecting the natural environment and minimizing negative impact.
* **Trampling on plants is harmful.** It damages the ecosystem, destroys habitats, and contributes to soil erosion. This is the opposite of responsible ecotourism.
* **The other options are examples of respectful ecotourism:**
    * **Kuhamba ngetinyawo kuya empophomeni (Hiking in the forest):**  A low-impact activity.
    * **Kutsebula titfombe (Taking pictures):**  Doesn't inherently harm the environment.
    * **Kudoba tindiza (Watching birds):** A passive observation activity.
    * **Kuvakashela imnyuziyemu yesayensi (Visiting a science museum):**  Often focuses on education about nature.



Therefore, trampling on plants is the only option that doesn't align with the principles of ecotourism as described in the passage."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokusisekelo sendlela yekusebenta yetekutfutsa?","The correct answer is **C: I-Biosphere lezinzile**.

Here's why:

* **The passage links the fossilized carbon to the biosphere.** It states that scientists are studying the carbon to understand the natural process of carbon cycling over millions of years. The biosphere is the sphere of life on Earth, and carbon cycling is a fundamental process *within* the biosphere.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Tindzawo tekusebenta (Workplaces):** While workplaces are relevant to human activity, the passage focuses on a much broader, geological process.
* **B: Timoto letitimele (Autonomous vehicles):**  This is a modern concept and not relevant to the ancient geological processes discussed.
* **D: Kugucuka kwemvelo yebantfu (Human environmental change):** While human activity *does* impact the environment, the passage is specifically about a natural, long-term process of carbon cycling.



Therefore, the answer **C: I-Biosphere lezinzile** best reflects the passage's core idea.



"
Tincenye letitungeleta i-nucleus tinaluphi luhlobo lekushaja?,"The correct answer is **D: Kushaja lokuhle nalokungasikahle**

Here's why:

* **Protons** have a positive electric charge (positive).
* **Neutrons** have no electric charge (neutral).
* **Electrons** have a negative electric charge (negative).

Therefore, the nucleus contains both positive (protons) and negative (electrons, though electrons orbit the nucleus) charges. The overall charge of the nucleus is usually positive because it contains protons.
"
I-nucleus yakhiwe ngutiphi tincenye?,"The correct answer is **D: Ema-Proton, ema-neutron, kanye nema electron**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inyukliyasi inetintfo letimbili - emanyuthroni nemaphrothoni. Ema-protons ane-positive electric charge kantsi ema-neutrons akanayo sanhlobo i-charge. Ema-electrons ane-negative electric charge.""

Therefore, the nucleus is made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. While the nucleus is *primarily* composed of protons and neutrons, the passage explicitly mentions the existence of electrons in relation to the atom as a whole.  Option D is the most complete and accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokusibonelo senombolo yanombolombili lemihlanu?","The question asks for the decimal equivalent of the binary number 1010.

To convert a binary number to decimal, we multiply each digit by 2 raised to the power of its position, starting from the rightmost digit with position 0.

So, for 1010:
(1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0)
= (1 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (0 * 1)
= 8 + 0 + 2 + 0
= 10

Now let's check the options:
A: 1010 -> 10
B: 12001 -> 1*2^4 + 2*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 16 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 33
C: 10010 -> 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 18
D: 110101 -> 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 32 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 53

The correct decimal equivalent of 1010 is 10.  Option A matches that.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{A}$"
Tinombolo tanombolombili tiphindze tibitwe ngekutsi tiyini?,"The correct answer is **A: Emabhithi**.

The question states that binary numbers with combined digits (0 or 1) are called ""emabhithi"" in the text. ""Emabhithi"" translates to ""bits"" in English.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emanani** - This translates to ""values,"" which is too general.
* **C: Ijagoni** - This doesn't have a clear meaning in this context.
* **D: Emafomu** - This translates to ""forms,"" which is irrelevant to the description of binary numbers.



"
Ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo endzimeni njengenzuzo leyiyinhloko yeku-bhuloga bafundzi?,"The correct answer is **D: Kwandza kwesifiso sekuchubeka nekufundza (Increased desire to explore and learn)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes that blogs can foster a desire for deeper learning and exploration.** It mentions students becoming more inquisitive and wanting to engage with the world around them. This aligns directly with option D.
* **While the text *mentions* improved language and writing skills (Option A), it frames it as a consequence of the broader desire for exploration and engagement.** It isn't the *primary* benefit explicitly stated.
* **Option B (reduced plagiarism) and Option C (increased enjoyment of the learning environment) are not explicitly mentioned as primary benefits of using blogs for students.** They are implied, but not the central focus of the passage.

Therefore, option D best encapsulates the main benefit of using blogs for student learning, according to the provided text.



"
Ngutiphi kuletincenye letilandzelako tekubhuloga letibalulwe njengetikhutsati kubafundzi kutsi batfutfukise emakhono abo ekubhala?,"The correct answer is **C: Kugcina sitsakaselo setilaleli**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sidzingo sekutsi babe nesitsakatelo kubantfu kubente bafundzi bahlakaniphe futsi baba nesifiso sekwenta lokutsite (Toto, 2004)."" This translates to ""There is a need for them to have a connection with people to make students smarter and have a desire to contribute (Toto, 2004)."" 

This connection with an audience (sittingelali) is crucial for fostering a desire to write well and avoid plagiarism, as mentioned later in the text. Option C directly reflects this core idea.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Lokuvame kuphendvula etintfweni letivela ku-inthanethi (Responding to issues arising from the internet):** While blogs can respond to internet issues, it's not the primary reason blogs are valuable for developing writing skills, according to the text.
* **B: Sifiso sekugwema kugcekwa (Desire to avoid plagiarism):** Avoiding plagiarism is a consequence of good writing habits, not the core benefit of blogging for skill development. The text emphasizes a broader desire to contribute.
* **D: Sidzingo sekubambisana (Need for collaboration):** The text doesn't emphasize collaboration as a key benefit of blogging for writing skill development. It focuses more on connection and audience.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo inzuzo yekuchumana lokungavumelani kwebafundzi? ,"The correct answer is **A: Kusetjentiswa kwe-inthanethi njengensita (Using the internet as a substitute)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how online resources and websites allow students to find information and get answers quickly, reducing the need to directly engage with teachers. This suggests a *substitution* of direct interaction (with the teacher) for online research.  This is framed as a potential *drawback* or something that is *not* necessarily a benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kufinyelela kwebuso nebuso kubafundzisi nanoma ngusiphi sikhatsi selusuku (Access to face-to-face interaction with teachers anytime):**  The passage implies *less* face-to-face interaction, making this incorrect.
* **C: Emahora ekusebenta lagucugucukako (Flexible working hours):**  Flexible working hours are presented as a *benefit* of student autonomy.
* **D: Kulawula litubane (Control over the pace):** This is explicitly stated as a *benefit* of the approach.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, nguyiphi kuletincenye letilandzelako tekuchumana lokungafaki sikhatsi kwebafundzi lokungavumelana netimo?","The correct answer is **D: Kusetjentiswa kwe-inthanethi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the internet and websites allow students to find information anytime and ask questions without needing to wait for teacher availability. This directly relates to the reduction of time constraints and the ability for students to learn at their own pace and convenience.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Sivinini sekufundza (Learning pace):** While the passage mentions allowing students to learn at their own pace, the core point about *reducing time constraints* is more directly tied to the internet.
* **B: Emahora ekusebenta (Working hours):** This is not directly addressed in the passage. The focus is on how technology changes *when* students can access information.
* **C: Tintfo tekufundzisa (Teaching materials):** The passage doesn't discuss changes in teaching materials.

Therefore, the internet's ability to provide instant access to information and reduce reliance on teacher availability is the strongest link to the reduction of time constraints for students.
"
Yini lengakabalwa kulendzima njengentfo umuntfu langahle ayihlanganise netincaba tesikhatsi se-medieval?,"The correct answer is **B: Ema-Jousts**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the prominence of tournaments (emidlalweni) and jousting (e-ma-jousts) in medieval society.** It mentions the revival of these activities as a way to reconnect with the glory and prestige of chivalry and war.
* **The passage also mentions castles (lichatsi) and the role of knights (amagumede).**  While knights were important, jousting was a key event *associated* with knights and a significant part of the medieval cultural landscape.
* **The other options are less directly tied to the passage's central themes:**
    * **A: Imigodzi lakuvalelwa khona tiboshwa (Castles being used as prisons):** While castles *could* be used as prisons, this isn't the primary emphasis of the passage.
    * **C: Buchawe (Feuds):** Feuds were a part of medieval life, but the passage focuses more on the *public displays of skill and honor* that tournaments represented.
    * **D: Ema-Knights (Knights):** Knights are mentioned, but the passage focuses on *what they did* (participated in tournaments) rather than just *being* knights.



Therefore, **Ema-Jousts** is the best answer because it is the most directly related to the activities and cultural revival discussed in the passage."
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakakhulunywa endzimeni njengeliphunga noma umsindvo longavakala phakatsi kwemanciwa enkinga?,"The correct answer is **B: Kusaba (Fear)**.

Here's why:

* **The first part of the question** discusses the historical importance of cattle, bravery, and prestige in Nguni culture, particularly in connection with ceremonies and warfare. This sets the stage for understanding the significance of *kusaba* (fear/bravery).

* **The second part of the question** asks what is *not* discussed in the context of a chief's prestige or honor.  *Kusaba* (bravery, courage) is a central aspect of a chief's prestige, directly linked to successful warfare and protection of the people.

* **Timpi (Wealth/Livestock)** is important, but not the *primary* focus of prestige in this context.  Wealth can *enable* bravery, but it isn't bravery itself.
* **Emadzili (Royal Regalia/Ornaments)** contribute to prestige, but are tools to *display* status, not the core of it.
* **Tinselo (Counsel/Advice)** is valuable, but not directly tied to the core concepts of bravery, strength, and protection emphasized in the first part of the question.

Therefore, *kusaba* (bravery) is the answer because it is the *central* element of prestige and honor discussed, and the other options are less directly connected to that core concept.



"
Nguyiphi kulokulandzelako inchazelo lecondzile yeKirby Muxloe Castle?,"The correct answer is **B: Beyidzinga kuciniswa lokuncane ngenca yesimo selive lesinekuthula ngalesikhatsi kwakhiwa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nguyiphi kulokulandzelako inchazelo lecondzile yeKirby Muxloe Castle? Ngeminyaka yabo-1480, ngesikhatsi icala kwakhiwa nguLord Hastings, lelive belinekuthula futsi kutivikela kwakudzingeka kuphela kubantfu labambalwa labebababulali.""

This translates to: ""What is the most accurate explanation of Kirby Muxloe Castle? In the year 1480, when the castle was built by Lord Hastings, the manor was peaceful and only needed to protect the captured murderers.""

The text emphasizes that the manor was peaceful and the castle was built *to protect the captured murderers*. This means the primary reason for the castle's construction was not defense against a major attack but rather the need to secure and contain prisoners. Therefore, option B is the most accurate interpretation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tindvonga letikhulu teCastle tacelwa nguLord Hastings** (The main towers of the Castle were built by Lord Hastings): While true, this doesn't explain *why* the castle was built.
*   **C: Kwakhiwa kweCastle bekungasiyo intfo levamile ngesikhatsi** (The construction of the Castle was not a common thing at that time): The text implies it was a response to a specific situation (the need to protect prisoners), not an unusual event in itself.
*   **D: Yakhelwe kusekela kuhlaselwa lokudze nekutimisela** (It was built to support attacks and raids): The text specifically states the manor was peaceful and the castle was for *protection*, contradicting this option.



"
Ngutiphi kuleti tici letilandzelako tekwakha letingatsatfwa njengaletijwayelekile te-Kirby Muxloe Castle ngesikhatsi lesichazwe endzimeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Emafasitelo lamakhulu (The main walls)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lifastelo labo lelimanyako nelubondza loluncama bekungeke kumelane nekuhlaselwa lokuchubekako."" This translates to ""Their extensive castle, which was surrounded by a curtain wall, would not withstand a prolonged siege.""  The ""curtain wall"" (or main walls) are the primary defense against attack.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Sisekelo lesakhelwe kusekela kuhlaselwa (The base built to withstand the attack):** While a strong base is important, the passage focuses on the overall vulnerability of the *walls* to a siege.
* **C: Kuciniswa lokuncane kunalamanye ema-Castle (It was smaller than other castles):** The passage doesn't directly compare Kirby Muxloe's size to other castles.  The issue isn't necessarily size, but the design of its defenses.
* **D: Emadvonga lamancane (The small towers):** While towers contribute to defense, the main walls were the first line of defense that the passage highlights as inadequate.



Therefore, the main walls (emafasitelo lamakhulu) are the most directly related element to the vulnerability described in the passage.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungazuzisa kakhulu kumgijimi lolungiselela sikhatsi lesitako?","The correct answer is **A: Kutijwayeta kugijima emaveni lahlukene ehlobo (Getting accustomed to running on different terrains)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of varied training to prepare for winter running.  The core idea is that running on different surfaces helps build strength and adapt to changing conditions. Option A directly addresses this by advocating for training on diverse terrains.

Here's why the other options are less relevant based on the passage:

*   **B: Gcila ekuhlakuleleni sivinini ngalesikhatsi ucecesha (Focus on stretching while you cool down):** While stretching is important, the passage doesn't highlight cool-down stretching as a primary factor in winter running preparation.
*   **C: Kushaya sikhatsi semizuzu lemitsatfu (Taking short breaks):** Short breaks can be beneficial, but the passage focuses on consistent effort and adapting to the conditions, not specifically on break frequency.
*   **D: Kusebentisa i-gym kutivocavoca umtimba losetulu (Using the gym to strengthen the core):**  The passage mentions core strength is important, but it's framed as part of the overall adaptation to winter running, not necessarily the *most* crucial factor related to winter preparation.

**Therefore, adapting to different terrains (Option A) is the most directly and strongly supported idea within the passage about preparing for winter running.**"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokubaluleke kakhulu kumgijimi welibanga lekucala?","The correct answer is **D: Kuhlakulela sivinini ngetulu kwekubeketela**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that while running a full mile is important, the *frequency* of running is crucial. It states: ""yonkhe imijaho idzinga kukhutsatela"" which translates to ""all sports need to be practiced.""  The text also mentions that even a short run (2 minutes) needs to be done regularly.  This points to consistency and frequency as more vital than the length of each individual run.  

Option D (""Kuhlakulela sivinini ngetulu kwekubeketela"" - Gradually increase distance above pace) aligns best with this concept of building up gradually over time and prioritizing consistent training.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutijwayeta kugijima emaveni lahlukene ngetinyanga yebusika** (Getting accustomed to running in different terrains during the winter months) -  While helpful, it's not the *most* crucial aspect according to the text.
*   **B: Kuhlakulela kubeketela ngetulu kwelitubane** (Gradually increase pace above distance) - The text doesn't prioritize pace over distance.
*   **C: Kungena ngaphasi kwemizuzu lemibili** (Entering within 2 minutes) - The text says 2 minutes is *not* enough and emphasizes the need for practice even with short runs.

"Kumsubatsi, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungeke kufezwe ngekusebentisa tinchubo tekudla lokunemsoco?","The correct answer is **A: Kusebenta lokutfutfukisiwe (Growth)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a diet solely of ""umkhuba wekudla kudla lokunemsoco nje kuphela"" (just a diet of insects) will prevent reaching a high level of development, but it *can* prevent the development of certain small things in life. Specifically, it mentions keeping the heart strong, avoiding things that might damage it, and preventing the development of ways of running that could make one happy again in the game.

While the diet might impact overall health (D) and potentially even happiness (B), the passage explicitly says it hinders *growth* (A).  It implies a limit to development, not just in terms of physical well-being but also in broader life aspects. Option C (""Kusebenta lokuhle kakhulu"" - Works very well) is the opposite of what the passage suggests.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Kusebenta lokutfutfukisiwe (Growth)**.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakaphakanyisa njengendlela yekuba basubatsi labasebasha batfole injabulo lengetiwe emdlalweni wabo?","The correct answer is **D: Kugcina ibhalansi yemandla lanemphilo (Maintaining a balance of power and vitality)**.

Here's why:

The initial statement emphasizes that focusing *only* on winning isn't enough. It highlights the importance of overall well-being (health, strength, and emotional balance) for sustained enjoyment.  Option D directly reflects this by advocating for a balanced approach to gameplay, suggesting that maintaining both physical and mental well-being is crucial for long-term enjoyment.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kwenta Kudla lokufanele (Playing properly):** While important, this focuses solely on the mechanical aspects of the game and doesn't address the broader importance of well-being.
*   **B: Kusebenta ngalokuchubekako ezingeni lelisetulu (Playing competitively at a high level):** This directly contradicts the initial statement's warning against focusing *only* on winning. It emphasizes pressure and potentially negative consequences.
*   **C: Kutsambisa ngemphumelelo (Achieving success):** Similar to B, this focuses on winning and doesn't prioritize well-being.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani umsubatsi welibanga leliphakatsi angahle atsenge lucetu lemshini lobita kakhulu?","The correct answer is **B: Inetinzuzo letifakazelwe** (They have foreseen the benefits).

Here's why:

The passage states that while it's possible to buy and use unusual machinery, the *results* might be minimal or even non-existent.  It also implies that there's a risk involved in investing in such machinery.  Therefore, a wise leader would avoid investing heavily in machinery that might not deliver significant returns.  

Option B, ""They have foreseen the benefits,"" directly contradicts this.  If the leader *foresaw benefits*, they would be more likely to invest in the machinery.  The passage implies the leader would *not* foresee significant benefits from unusually expensive machinery.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kukhetsa kwabo sicu (Their own choices):** This is too general.  It doesn't explain *why* their choices would lead to avoiding expensive machinery.
* **C: Itoba nemtselela lomuhle ekusebenteni kwabo (They have a good reputation for work):**  Reputation doesn't directly correlate to smart financial decisions regarding risky investments.
* **D: Kenemibono leliphutsa mayelana nemishini lengabiti kakhulu (They have mistaken ideas about very expensive machinery):**  While the passage suggests there might be misconceptions, it's not the primary reason for avoiding such machinery; the potential lack of return is the bigger concern.



Therefore, **B** is the most logically sound answer based on the text."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kugijima kwelibanga lelisemkhatsini kudzingani?","The correct answer is **B: Sizindza sekusubatsa lesimisiwe**.

Here's why:

The text describes how manipulating the ""scent"" (tintfo letitsite) in the time-libanga is not a straightforward game. It implies that creating a specific scent requires a carefully measured and controlled process – a ""sizindza sekusubatsa lesimisiwe"" (a precisely measured and mixed substance).  The passage hints at the need for precision and careful execution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imishini leminingi (A lot of equipment):** While *some* equipment might be involved, the text doesn't emphasize a large amount of machinery. The focus is on the precise mixing of scents.
* **C: Imishini lencane kakhulu (Very small equipment):**  The size of the equipment isn't the key factor; it's the *precision* of the mixing.
* **D: Imali leningi (A lot of money):** The text doesn't mention that creating the scent is expensive. The emphasis is on the technical process.

Ngubani lowatfola i-nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: I-Bloch kanye ne-Purcell**.

The text states: ""MRI imayelana ne-physicc phenomenon lebitwa nge-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), leyatfolwa ngabo 1930 ngu-Felix Bloch (asebenta eNyuvesi yaseStanford) na-Edward Purcell (lobuya eNyuvesi yeHarvard).""  This directly indicates that Bloch and Purcell discovered NMR.
"
Lilungelo lekucala lebunikati laniketwa ngamuphi umnyaka yetekwelapha i-imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Ngemuva kweminyaka lemine lilungelo lebunikati baniketwa, lelilungele belilekucala emhlabeni lelake laniketwa MRI.""  Raymond Damadian received the patent four years after he discovered the potential of using magnetic resonance for medical imaging. He was granted the patent in 1970, so four years later would be 1974.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 1977** - This is when Damadian built the first ""whole-body"" MRI scanner.
*   **C: 1930** - This is when Bloch and Purcell discovered Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).
*   **D: 1970** - This is the year Damadian discovered the potential of magnetic resonance for medical imaging.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 1974**.

"ngekusho kwendzima, yini lekufanele kutsi bantfu bayivisise ngalokucinile kute bachaze tento talabanye letingekwenyama?","The correct answer is **C: Inkolelo (Belief)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that judging others based on assumptions can lead to misunderstandings.  The core of this misunderstanding stems from making assumptions about *what others believe* or *what motivates them*.  

*   **Inkolelo (Belief):** This directly relates to what someone holds to be true.  When we assume someone's actions are driven by something we *believe* to be true about them (even if it's not accurate), we're prone to misjudgment.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as suitable:

*   **Sifiso (Desire/Wish):**  While desires can influence actions, the passage focuses more on the underlying *reasoning* or *beliefs* behind actions, not just the desires themselves.
*   **Inhloso (Purpose/Goal):** Similar to desire, purpose is a factor, but the passage's focus is on the assumed reasoning *behind* the purpose.
*   **Kucondza (Judging):**  The passage warns *against* judging, not about what *should* be judged.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: Inkolelo (Belief)**."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kuvisisa injongo kusita bantfu kutsi benteni?","The correct answer is **C: Buka labanye bantfu ngaphandle kwekukwahlulela.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding others' perspectives and avoiding judgment.**  The entire point is to prevent us from jumping to conclusions based on limited information.  
* **Option C directly reflects this idea.** Looking at others without judging them is crucial to understanding their actions and motivations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kucedza kungaciniseki ngemuva kwetento temtimba** - This is unrelated to the passage's main theme.
* **B: Cagela tifiso** -  The passage is about understanding *why* people do things, not judging their desires.
* **D: Fundza tingcondvo talabanye** - While reading others' intentions is *part* of the solution, the core of the passage is *how we interpret* those intentions - avoiding hasty judgment.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokufinciwe lokungiko kwenhloso ye-Al?","The correct answer is **C: Kuhlela (Planning)**.

Here's why:

The text states that AI is used for tasks that *require human intention*, such as ""kucondzisa, kuhlela nekwenta emlungiselelo"" (planning, organizing, and making preparations).  This directly connects AI to the ability to plan.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kulungiselela (Preparing)** - While AI *can* contribute to preparation, it's a broader category than the specific example given in the text.
*   **B: Kukhumbula livi (Remembering information)** -  Remembering information is a capability of AI, but the text focuses on AI's role in *doing* tasks, not just remembering.
*   **D: Umsebenti lotentakalelako (Purposeful task)** - This is too general. The text emphasizes AI's role in *performing* purposeful tasks, which includes planning.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lavame kuhlotjaniswa nako Al?","The correct answer is **C: Inganekwane yesayensi (Artificial Intelligence)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngisho noma Al anenchazelo lecinile ngenganekwane yesayensi..."" (Even though AI has a precise definition in scientific intelligence...) This directly links AI to the concept of artificial intelligence.

The passage then goes on to describe what AI *does*, highlighting its ability to mimic human cognitive functions.  While the other options are things AI *can* do, the question asks what is *typically* associated with AI in terms of weight or importance. Artificial intelligence is the overarching field.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungemandla emuntfu lonemaphethini ekucabanga lagucukako?","The correct answer is **A: Bona timphedvulo letiningi letilungile enkingeni (See multiple good solutions to the problem)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes convergent thinking as focusing on one correct answer.  The opposite of this is to explore *multiple* potential solutions.  Therefore, seeing multiple good solutions directly contradicts the single-solution nature of convergent thinking.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Sebentisa emasu lamasha enkingeni (Use fresh eyes on the problem):** This is more about problem-solving in general and isn't specifically linked to avoiding convergent thinking.
* **C: Kutsatsa sikhatsi sabo kucazulula inkinga (Spend more time solving the problem):**  Time spent doesn't inherently change the thinking pattern.  Someone could spend a lot of time still looking for one solution.
* **D: Khumbula emaphethini (Remember patterns):** This is characteristic of convergent thinking, which relies on recognizing established patterns to find the correct answer.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungabukwa njengekugcila kwemcondvo wekucabanga logucukako?","The correct answer is **A: kuvisisa kutsi kunempendvulo leyodvwa lefanele (excluding that there is only one correct answer)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines rigidity (lugcila) as a mindset characterized by a single, fixed response to problems. Option A directly reflects this definition by stating that rigidity involves *not* considering that there might be multiple valid answers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kutsatsa sikhatsi semuntfu (Spending time)** - While rigidity might *involve* wasting time on a single approach, it's not the core defining characteristic. Rigidity is about *how* the time is spent (fixed approach) not the time itself.
*   **C: Kukhomba emaciniso (Pointing out truths)** - Rigidity isn't about truth; it's about being unwilling to accept alternative truths or solutions. Rigidity can *ignore* truths.
*   **D: Kucoca lwati (Clarifying knowledge)** - Rigidity can hinder clarifying knowledge if it's unwilling to explore different interpretations or perspectives. But the clarification itself isn't what *defines* the rigidity.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer because it directly addresses the core concept of a single, fixed response in rigid thinking.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungeke kutsatfwe njenge kusho lokuncane?","The passage emphasizes the importance of attentive listening and understanding, and how people can discern sincerity even when verbal communication is lacking. It also highlights the value of collaborative learning and shared understanding.

The question asks which action is *least* likely to be noticed when someone is speaking. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ubuke khashane ngalesikhatsi ukhuluma (Looking away while speaking):** This is a noticeable sign of disengagement and lack of sincerity.
*   **B: Uvula butjoki (Opening a notebook):**  While it could be a genuine need for reference, it's also a noticeable action that might suggest the person isn't fully engaged in the conversation.
*   **C: Kucwabita ngekushesha (Fidgeting rapidly):** Fidgeting is a common sign of nervousness or discomfort and is easily noticed.
*   **D: Kuphakamisa sitfupha (Raising an eyebrow):**  Raising an eyebrow is a very noticeable nonverbal cue that can indicate surprise, skepticism, or interest.

Considering the context of the passage, the action least likely to be noticed would be something subtle and commonplace. Of the options, **B: Uvula butjoki (Opening a notebook)** is the *least* intrusive or attention-grabbing action. It's something a speaker might do without drawing much attention to themselves, even if it's not necessarily a sign of genuine engagement.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako mayelana nekutoliga kwe-micro-expression lokungasilo liciniso?,"The correct answer is **C: Inkhulumo kanye nesimo sebuso kuyatoliga.**

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that analyzing video recordings allows for the detection of discrepancies between what is said and how someone expresses themselves nonverbally (facial expressions, body language). This directly relates to the idea that speech and facial expressions are linked and can be used to assess truthfulness.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kucoshwa kwemavidiyo kuholele entuthukweni lenkhulu:** While true, it's too general. The text focuses on the specific application of video analysis to detecting deception through inconsistencies.
*   **B: Kuhumusha lokulungile kungahle kubone kucamba emanga:** This is a possibility, but not the main point. The text focuses on the *analysis* of the recording itself, not just the quality of the translation.
*   **D: Kungasite kuhlola bucotho:** While truth assessment is a goal, the text highlights the integration of verbal and nonverbal cues as the method to achieve it.

Therefore, option C best summarizes the core message of the text concerning micro-expressions and truthfulness.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokwabaluleka kakhulu ngenca ye-Renaissance? ,"The correct answer is **C: Khumbula umbhalo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bekungenancindzetelo lehlala emuntfwini loyedvwa, kodvwa likhono lekukhumbula lokubhaliwe ngilo lekwakugcilwe kulo.""  This means the ability to remember written information was a key shift during the Renaissance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inkhumbulo yemuntfu ngamunye:** While memory was important, the passage emphasizes *remembering written information* as the key change.
* **B: Kujikeletisa lwati:** This is too general. The passage focuses on a specific *change* in how knowledge was acquired, not a broader shift.
* **D: Kutfola umniningwane:** While finding information is part of the process, the core point is about *remembering* that information, particularly in written form.



"
"Njengemphumela we-Renaissance, ngukuphi lokwagcizelelwa kancane kulokulandzelako?","The correct answer is **C: Khumbula umbhalo (Remembering written text)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the invention of the printing press shifted the way knowledge was acquired.  Previously, knowledge was primarily passed down orally. The printing press allowed for the **memorization of written information**.  The Renaissance, building on this, heavily emphasized the importance of accessible written materials and the ability to read and remember them.  Options A, B, and D are secondary consequences or aspects, but the core focus driven by the printing press and emphasized during the Renaissance was the ability to retain and utilize *written* information.

Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakhombisi lugcozi lekusebentisa i-inthanethi kute uchubeke nebudlelwane?,"The correct answer is **C: Kucwaninga luhambo (Travel research)**.

Here's why:

The provided text focuses on how the internet facilitates **social connection and relationships**. It emphasizes ""communication,"" ""social interaction,"" and ""building relationships."" The examples given (""learning"" and ""entertainment"") are all activities typically associated with connecting with others.

*   **A: Kuchumana kwebhizinisi (Business communication)** - Can absolutely involve building relationships and connection, even if the primary focus is business.
*   **B: Kuhlala uchumene nemndeni (Staying connected with family)** - A very strong example of using the internet to maintain relationships.
*   **D: Kuhlangana nebantfu labasha (Meeting new people)** -  A key function of many online platforms and a clear way to build new connections.
*   **C: Kucwaninga luhambo (Travel research)** - While travel research *might* involve some online forums or communities, its primary function isn't relationship building or social connection. It's focused on gathering information about travel destinations. It doesn't inherently demonstrate the internet's use for fostering relationships.



Therefore, travel research is the option that *least* demonstrates the internet's use for connecting and building relationships as highlighted in the text."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakhombisa lugcizi lekusebentisa i-inthanethi kute ubambe luchaza lesicu semuntfu?,"The best answer is **A: Ngifuna irisiphi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the emotional and social aspects of internet use.** It mentions ""learning"" and ""entertainment"" as important motivations and highlights ""social interaction"" and ""strong relationships.""
* **""Ngifuna irisiphi"" (I want a recipe)** falls under the category of seeking information and fulfilling a practical need. While it involves using the internet, it doesn't inherently demonstrate a deep emotional connection or social interaction with others.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kutfumela ebhodini letingcoco letiku-inthanethi (Accessing online forums):** This *does* represent social interaction and community, aligning with the passage's focus.
* **C: Kucwaninga ngemkhicito wekunakekelwa kwwtemphilo (Researching healthcare practices):** This is information-seeking, but doesn't necessarily emphasize the emotional or relational aspects.
* **D: Kuphatsa timali (Making purchases):** While it involves interaction with businesses, it's primarily a transactional activity, not driven by emotional connection.

Therefore, ""ngifuna irisiphi"" is the option that *least* demonstrates a deep emotional or social need, and thus best highlights the passage's argument about the internet fulfilling practical information needs without necessarily fostering strong human connections.
"
Inshonalanga ye-Europe iyekela nini kutsembela kakhulu ekucaleni futsi yacala kutfutfukisa sitayela sayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngasekupheleni kwetikhatsi letiphakatsi (At the end of the Middle Ages)**.

The passage states: ""Ngasekupheleni kwesikhatsi lesibitwa ngekutsi iMiddle Ages intshonalanga yeYurophu yacala kutfutfukisa indlela yayo."" which translates to ""At the end of the time called the Middle Ages, the European style began to develop its own way.""

Therefore, option A is the accurate answer.
"
Kusebentisa tinkinobho kute kuhlanganiswe tingubo kwaba ngumphumela wani? ,"The correct answer is **C: Tinkholo (Religion)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Lokunye kutfutfuka kwalesikhatsi ngenca yaletimphi tebantfu telukholo bantfu bacala kusebentisa tinkinobho kufasa timphahla."" This translates to: ""Another development during this time was due to the people of faith, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes."" Therefore, the adoption of buttons as a way to fasten clothes was driven by religious influences/beliefs.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokubonwa njengesicatululo lesisebentako sesikhatsi lesidze etindzabeni temvelo?","The correct answer is **D: Kuba ngumfelandzawonye wenhlangano yetemvelo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of working *with* nature, not just reacting to problems.** It advocates for engaging with environmental organizations to promote sustainable solutions.
* **Option D directly aligns with this idea.** Becoming a member of an environmental organization is an active step towards contributing to solutions and working collaboratively.
* **Option A (Kwala kukhetsa indlela yekuphila lebukhatikhati - Choosing a lifestyle) is too broad.** While lifestyle choices are important, the passage stresses the need for broader, organized action.
* **Option B (Bushoshovu - Protest) is reactive.** While protests can be part of the solution, they don't address the root cause of the problem as effectively as proactive engagement with organizations.
* **Option C (Kukhomba imbangela yendzaba - Identifying the cause) is a necessary step, but not a solution *in itself*.** The passage says you need to find the root cause, but then implies that finding the cause isn't enough; you need to *remove* it.


Therefore, becoming a member of an environmental organization is the most practical and active step towards addressing the environmental challenges discussed in the passage.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi kuleticatululo letilandzelako lesingeke sitsatfwe njenge kulashwa lokutimphawu tetindzaba temvelo?","The correct answer is **B: Kuvala timbangela tetinkinga** (Closing the causes of the problem).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that addressing the symptoms (like environmental degradation) is insufficient. It stresses the need to find and remove the root cause of the problem. Option B directly addresses this by suggesting tackling the underlying causes.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kutibandzakanya emsebentini** (Engaging in activities): While helpful, this doesn't necessarily address the root cause.  It could involve activities that inadvertently contribute to the problem.
*   **C: Kuveta imibono mayelana nekukhetsa lokubukhatikhati yekuphila** (Expressing opinions about lifestyle choices):  Lifestyle choices *can* be part of the problem, but focusing solely on opinions doesn't solve the fundamental issue.
*   **D: Kuphila ngendlela levumelana nemvelo** (Living in a way that aligns with nature): This is a good goal, but it's a consequence of addressing the root cause, not a solution to the symptoms themselves. It is a positive step, but not the *primary* solution according to the passage.

Therefore, **closing the causes of the problem** aligns most closely with the passage's core argument.

Beyikuliphi live impi yekucala e-Europe lebekutsiwa indzaba yayo leyinhloko ihlobene nekulinganisela kwemandla kunekutsi ibe nekonga kwenkholo?,"The correct answer is **D: E-Spain**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Impi yekutsi ngubani labefanele kubusa leyaliwa Spain yaba yimpi yekucala lebe umgomo wayo kukukhombisa ngubani lonemandla."" (The war fought over who should rule Spain was the first war whose goal was to demonstrate who had the power.)
"
Nguyiphi impi lechazwa ngekutsi impi yenkholo yekugcina ngalesinye sikhatsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Impi Yeminyaka Lemashumi Lamatsatfu (The Thirty Years' War)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Loku kwakusho lushintjo lolubalulekile, njengoba tiphatsimandla taseYurophu besetingeke tikhone kucamba emanga batsi basemphini yenkholo. **Imphi Yeminyaka Lemashumi Lamatsatfu** beyitawuba yekugcina kutsi ibitwe ngekutsi yimphi yenkholo."" (This means that European powers were able to act on the basis of faith. **The Thirty Years' War** was the last war to be called the war of faith.)



"
Nguyiphu kuletici letilandzelako telisontfo lemaCatholic lebeyingahlolisiswa?,"The correct answer is **B: Uma timiso letiyinhloko yenkholo kufanele tichibiyelwe.**

Here's why:

The passage discusses the power and influence of the Catholic Church in Europe. It highlights how the Church's teachings were a unifying force despite linguistic and cultural differences. A key tenet of Christianity is that the Gospel should be made accessible to all. Therefore, **standardizing core religious doctrines** would be a logical consequence and a crucial aspect of the Catholic Church's development and influence.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Uma lokwabiwe kwemcebo phakatsi ebandleni kufanelekile:** While organization was important, the passage focuses more on the *content* of the faith and its spread, not specifically on the administrative structure.
*   **C: Kuhlangana kwemandla ngekhatsi kwelisontfo:** The passage mentions the Church's power and wealth, but it's not the primary focus. The standardized doctrines are a more fundamental aspect of its development.
*   **D: Kube bekuhlangabetwana netimfundziso letisemcoka telisontfo:** The passage doesn't mention any doctrinal disputes. It presents a relatively unified picture of the Church's influence.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lowabulawa eVersailles?","The correct answer is **B: Inkosi Louis XVI**.

The text states that King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their children were brought to Paris and then **imprisoned** in the Temple. It also mentions the crowd stormed the royal palace and forced the King and Queen to open their prison doors.  While there's a mention of a guard being suggested to be executed, the text explicitly states the King was imprisoned.  The question asks who was *killed* at Versailles. The provided text doesn't state anyone was killed at Versailles, only that the family was brought *from* Versailles to Paris and imprisoned. However, given the context of the French Revolution and the eventual fate of Louis XVI, and considering the options, the most logical answer is that he was the one who ultimately met with death, even though this isn't explicitly stated in this particular excerpt.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakaphocwa sicuku eNkosini naseNdlovukatini?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuvulwa kwemafasitelo encola yabo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lesigungu sebantfu saphocelela leNkhosi neNdlovukati kutsi bagcine emafastelo encola yabo avuliwe."" (The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the doors of their palace open.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuphuma lokungakalindzelelki eVersailles:** While a surprise might have been involved in the initial journey to Paris, the text doesn't mention anything happening *at* Versailles during the crowd's actions.
* **C: Kubuka kwekujutjwa kwenhloko yalogadako:** The text mentions a suggestion to bring the head of the disgraced courtier to the Queen, but it doesn't say it actually happened during the crowd's actions.
* **D: Luhambo lolubuyela eParis:** The text describes the journey *to* Paris, not a subsequent journey back.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungasiwo umphumela wempi lengakajwayeleki yaseBritain?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwentiwa tingucuko emtsetfweni wemave wonkhe** (There was a disruption in the global trade).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** The British minefields disrupted shipping, causing losses of gold and ships, and disrupting the global trade.  This directly supports options B and D.

* **The passage also states:** Germany anticipated a similar response and planned to use underwater mines. This supports option A.

* **However, the passage makes no mention of disruptions or issues arising *within* the global trade itself (e.g., political disputes, trade embargoes).** It focuses on the *physical* disruption caused by the mines. Therefore, option C is the *least* likely outcome described in the passage.

Therefore, option C is the correct answer because it wasn't mentioned in the text.
"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesingakuchazi kahle kuvinjwa kwemikhumbi yempi yase-Britain ngalokumelene neJalimani?,"The correct answer is **D: Kucinisekise kutsi imikhumbi ldngatsatsi hlangotsi angeke ibe engotini (It ensures that enemy ships will never be sunk).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the mines *did* sink ships and cause significant losses.**  Option D is the opposite of what the passage describes. The mines *didn't* ensure no ships would be sunk; they resulted in many sinkings.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Kuphambane nemtsetfo wemave wonkhe (It was part of a total war effort):** The passage explicitly mentions the mines were part of a large-scale, coordinated effort that involved various military strategies and technologies.
* **B: Kwabangela impi yemikhumbi-ngwenya faseJalimani (It caused naval warfare between Britain and Germany):** The passage describes the British minefields as a defensive measure designed to prevent German ships from entering the waters. This directly contributed to naval conflict.
* **C: Kuphatamise kuhamba kwetimphahla taseJalimani (It hampered the movement of German supplies):** The mines significantly disrupted German shipping, making it difficult to transport supplies and resources.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the information given in the passage."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungaba kwabani kucilongwa kwe-Multiple Sclerosis?","The provided text states that women are more likely to get MS than men. Of the options given, the most plausible answer is:

**C: Lomdvuna loneminyaka lengu-43**

Here's why:

* **The text doesn't specify an age range.** However, option C represents an adult age, making it more likely than a teenager (B) or a very young adult (D).
* **The text mentions women are more susceptible.**  While not definitive, a woman in her 40s (option C) is a reasonable age for someone to be diagnosed with MS, keeping in mind the gender predisposition mentioned. 

Therefore, while we can't be certain, option C is the most logical choice based on the given information.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, bahlanganyeli emisebentini levamile bebadzinga kusekelwa lokungetiwe kwani?","The correct answer is **C: Kucindzeteleka (Compression)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lucwaningo lutfole kutsi kucindzeteleka, kwesaba kanye nekuba nelihamba endleleni lobukana ngayo nesimo lesitsite kuhlobaniswa nebuhlungu kanye nekukhubateka kulabo labahlushwa buhlungu bengemuva emhlane.""  This directly links compression (kucindzeteleka) to back pain.

While the other options might be *associated* with back pain, the passage identifies compression as a key factor.
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, kubiya kuvame kudlalwa njani?","The correct answer is **D: Ngefomethi ye-duel**.

Here's why:

The question states the game is primarily played between two people, one against one. ""Duel"" refers to a contest between two individuals.  The other options refer to levels or contexts of play, not the fundamental format.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kwalokulandzelako lokungaba inkhomba lenemandla yebutsi baphakatsi?","The correct answer is **C: Emajacamba lamatima kanye nebuhlungu besiso (Headaches and eye pain)**.

Here's why:

The initial text describes how a chemical exposure (like a cleaning product or wood preservative) might not cause immediate symptoms but can lead to delayed effects.  It specifically mentions looking for signs of exposure, such as a swollen or open wound.

The question asks for the next likely indicator of chemical poisoning *based on weight*.  While options A and B relate to physical symptoms, and D relates to seeking medical attention, **headaches and eye pain** are common symptoms of exposure to certain chemicals.  They are frequently experienced in the early stages of poisoning and often reported as a significant indicator of the problem. 

Therefore, option C is the most logically connected symptom to the initial description and relevant to the question of weight (meaning a potential indication of the severity of the exposure).



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sinyatselo sekucala lesifanele uma uhlola sisulu?","The correct answer is **C: Buka simo salohlukubetekile (Look at the unusual behavior)**.

Here's why:

* The provided text emphasizes the importance of observing the snake's behavior *as you approach*. This means paying attention to anything that seems out of the ordinary. 
* Option C directly reflects this advice.  ""Simo salohlukubetekile"" translates to ""unusual behavior.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Buka lesimo (Look at the situation):**  While understanding the environment is important, the text specifically focuses on the snake's actions.
* **B: Sondzela lohlukubetekile (Avoid the unusual):** This is a reactive measure.  The text prioritizes *observing* unusual behavior *before* needing to avoid it.
* **D: Lindza lusito (Wait for it to strike):**  This is dangerous advice. The text is about safety and preventing encounters, not provoking one.



"
Ngusiphi sitatimende kuletilandzelako lesingakhombisa ngalokungiko inchobo yekuhlola sisulu?,"The correct answer is **B: Hlola Indzawo yesigameko ngaphambi kwalojlukumetekile.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of checking the surroundings for safety *before* approaching a person in distress.** This is explicitly stated: ""Nawufuna kusita lomuntfu losenkhingeni kufanele ucale uhlolisise lendzawo lakwenteke khona lengoti kuze ucinisekise kuphepha kwakho."" (If you want to help someone in distress, you should first check the area where the incident occurred to ensure your safety.)

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ungakhatsateki ngekutilimata wena** (You don't have to worry about your own feelings) - While minimizing personal emotional impact is good, the main point is about *safety assessment*, not emotional detachment.
* **C: Buka sikhundla salohlukumetekile** (Look at the position of the injured person) - This is *part* of the assessment, but it doesn't encompass the broader safety check the passage stresses.
* **D: Zama kucaphela noma nguyiphi imijeko** (Try to avoid any disturbances) - This is a valid consideration, but it's secondary to ensuring your own safety by assessing the environment first.

Therefore, option B directly reflects the core message of the passage about the need for a pre-approach safety check."
Ngutiphi tingucuko letibangwe Ingucuko yaseFrance yaba nemtsetfo lomkhulu kutakhamuti setigaba setisebenti?,"The correct answer is **B: Kushintja kwekugcila esigabeni kuya ekhonweni (Shift from birthright to meritocracy)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kunetinkinga letinyenti tetenhlalo netepolitiki njengekusetjentiswa kweluhlelo lwe-metric...ngemuva kwetingucuko imisebenti yavuleka kubo bonkhe besilisa labafaka ticelo kuze labo labafuna kuphumelela baphumelele."" This translates to: ""The problem of social and political hierarchy is the use of a metric system...after the revolution, jobs opened to all men who submitted applications and those who wanted to succeed succeeded.""

This opening up of jobs based on ability and merit, rather than birthright (being born into a specific social class), is the core of a meritocracy.  The text also draws a parallel to the military, stating that soldiers are no longer placed in ranks based on their social class but on their work level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuseka lokungetiwe kwesive (Establishment of divine right):** The text describes the *opposite* – a move *away* from divine right.
* **C: Kuguculwa kwemibono yeRepublic (Expression of Republican ideas):** While the revolution did express Republican ideas, the question specifically asks about the *structural change* to job allocation.
* **D: Luhlelo lolusha lokulinganisa (New system of assessment):**  The ""metric system"" is mentioned, but the core change wasn't just a *new* assessment system, but a system that *prioritized merit over birthright*.



"
"Ngemuva kwengucuko yaseFrance, kuphumelela kwetimpi nakuleminye imisebenti bekungahle kusekelwe kuphi?","The correct answer is **D: Lizinga (Level)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a shift from a system based on birthright and political hierarchy to one based on merit and ability.  It mentions:

*   **""kusetjentiswa kweluhlelo lwe-metric""** (the use of a metric system) - suggesting a standardized and objective system.
*   **""kusuka ekutibambeleni ngalokuphelele etimisweni tetepolitiki kuya ekutseni bantfu bafake imibono neticondziso""** (from being completely bound by political terms to people being able to express their opinions and ideas) - indicating a focus on individual contribution.
*   **""ngemuva Kwetingucuko imisebenti yavuleka kubo bonkhe besilisa labafaka ticelo kuze labo labafuna kuphumelela baphumelele""** (after the revolution, jobs became open to all men who applied and wanted to succeed) - explicitly stating merit-based opportunities.
*  **""esikhundleni sekutsi emasotja emphi abekwe esigabeni lesitsite ngesigaba sawo manje sekabekwa ngekwelizinga lemsebenti wawo.""** (instead of soldiers being placed in a strictly hierarchical ranking based on their rank, they are now ranked according to their work level.) - This highlights that the position of the soldiers was not determined by their position in the hierarchy, but by their performance.

All these points strongly suggest that success and advancement were increasingly based on **level of skill and performance (lizinga)** rather than social status or birth.



"
Nguyiphi inkondzo yemphakatsi lekutsiwa ibanga kunganeliseki kakhulu emaveni latfutfukile?,"The correct answer is **A: Lizinga lemanti (Water level)**.

Here's why:

The question describes the benefits of traditional water-based transportation and why it's often unreliable, especially in drought-prone regions.  The core issue causing failure is the **water level**.  

* **Water level:** Fluctuations in water levels (droughts, seasonal changes) directly impact the ability to use canoes and other watercraft.  When water levels are low, travel becomes difficult or impossible.
* **Kwakhila kwelibhuloho (Dam construction):** While dam construction can impact water flow, it doesn't *inherently* cause failure. Dams are intended to manage water resources, but their construction and management can have unintended consequences.  The problem is the water level itself.
* **Tekutfutsa temphakatsi (Watercraft):**  The watercraft themselves can be poorly maintained or inadequate, but the fundamental problem causing *systemic* failure is the water level.
* **Imfundvo (Education):** Education is important for many things, but it doesn't directly address the core issue of water availability for transportation.



Therefore, the most accurate and direct answer to the question is that **water level** is the most frequently unsatisfactory element of traditional water-based transportation in drought-prone areas.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengashiwo mayelana netinhlelo tetekutfutsa temphakatsi?","The question asks why public transportation is generally favored but often fails, and what is *not* said about public transportation systems in terms of weight.

Let's analyze the question and the options:

**Question Breakdown:**

*   **Why public transport is favored but often fails:** The prompt states that generally, people prefer public transportation, but it frequently encounters problems. It asks for the reasons behind this discrepancy.
*   **What is NOT said about public transport systems in terms of weight:** This is a straightforward question asking which statement *doesn't* accurately describe public transport systems.

**Analyzing the Options:**

*   **A: Titsandvwa kakhulu nguwo wonkhe umuntfu lotisebentisako (It is very popular with everyone who uses it):** While many people *prefer* public transport, it's not universally beloved.  There are people who prefer driving, walking, or cycling. This statement is not necessarily accurate.
*   **B: Atisitibi njenge lizinga lemanti (It is not as affordable as the water level):** This statement is vague and doesn't directly relate to the common criticisms of public transport. ""Water level"" isn't a standard measure of affordability.
*   **C: Tibanga tikhalo letiningi ngalabo labatisebentisako (It is a complaint for many of those who use it):** This aligns with the initial prompt. Public transport is frequently criticized (for delays, overcrowding, etc.). This statement is likely accurate.
*   **D: Tikhululekile emaveni lamaningi latfutfukile (It is comfortable in many developed areas):** This is often *not* the case. Public transport in many areas is overcrowded, uncomfortable, and poorly maintained. This statement is likely inaccurate.

**The correct answer** is **A: Titsandvwa kakhulu nguwo wonkhe umuntfu lotisebentisako (It is very popular with everyone who uses it)** because it's not universally true.



Therefore, the correct answer is **A**."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungaba matima kukukala ngenca yekungabikeki kwebashayeli?","The correct answer is **A: Sivinini sesiminyeminye (Traffic congestion)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *follows* in terms of the scale of the unreliability of driver behavior. The passage states that drivers *appear* to be thinking when they drive smoothly, but their actual behavior isn't fully known.

The passage then lists three types of traffic flow disruptions:

1.  **Kugeleta (Queueing):** This is a minor disruption.
2.  **Kushuba (Jams):** This is a more significant disruption than queueing.
3.  **Sivinini (Congestion):** This is the *most* significant disruption, representing a major breakdown in traffic flow and the highest degree of unpredictability in driver behavior.

Therefore, congestion (sivinini) represents the highest level of unreliability in driver behavior compared to queueing or a minor jam.  The prompt is looking for the most substantial manifestation of driver unpredictability.

Let's look at why the other options are wrong:

*   **B: Kuhlela Umgwaco (Road Design):** Road design is a factor *influencing* traffic flow, but it doesn't directly relate to the *scale* of unreliability in driver behavior.
*   **C: Imisebenti yemgwaco (Road Works):** Road works are a specific *cause* of disruption but are not a measure of the underlying *degree* of driver behavior unpredictability.
*   **D: Kuhamba kwesiminyeminye (Flow of the other vehicles):**  This describes a type of traffic flow, but not the *scale* of unreliability.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokusebentiswa umele kusakatwa kwekuphitsitela kwetimoto ngetibalo?,"The answer is **C: Umklamo wemgwaco (Road Design)**.

Here's why:

The question describes how traffic flow is influenced by driver behavior, but also emphasizes the importance of *road design* (umklamo wemgwaco) in ensuring smooth traffic flow. The text explicitly states that the traffic flow pattern (queueing, congestion, blockage) is crucial for planning, construction, and operation of road infrastructure. Therefore, the next logical step in using traffic flow data for vehicle speed estimation would be to apply that data to *improve road design*.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Imisebenti yemgwaco (Road Maintenance):** While road maintenance is important, the question focuses on *design* in relation to traffic flow and speed.
* **B: Kutiphatsa kwemshayeli (Driver Behavior):**  The question acknowledges driver behavior influences flow, but the prompt is about *using* flow data, not just understanding driver behavior.
* **D: Kuminyana kwetimoto (Vehicle Collision):** Collision avoidance is a result of good road design and traffic management, but the direct application of traffic flow data is to improve the underlying infrastructure.



"
Hershey naChase basebentise ini kufaka i-DNA yabo? ,"The correct answer is **A: Radioactive phosphorus**.

Here's why:

* **Hershey and Chase's experiment relied on using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of the bacteriophages.** They tracked where the radioactive phosphorus ended up after the phages infected bacteria. Since DNA contains phosphorus, the radioactive phosphorus would be found within the bacterial cell, demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material being injected.
* While the question mentions radioactive sulfur, it's important to focus on the *phosphorus* used, as that's directly linked to DNA.
* Options B, C, and D are incorrect. They don't accurately describe the key element used in Hershey and Chase's experiment to identify DNA.



"
Lukhono lekugucula takhi telufuto tindlulele entalweni lencike kuphi?,"The correct answer is **C: Luhlobo lekugucuka**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Kugucuka kwesimo lokusetinhlayiyeni ema-germ-line kungadluliselwa kubantfwana, kepha kugucuka kwesimo lokunye kungabangela kufa kwetinhlayiya noma umdlavuza."" This directly links the type of mutation (germline vs. somatic) to the impact on the organism.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Uma emaseli ayi-germ-line:**  While somatic mutations (non-germline) don't affect offspring, the question is asking about *what determines the impact of the mutation*, not just its location.
* **B: Kubaluleka katakhi telufuto:**  The importance of the cell is a factor, but it's less direct than the *type* of mutation.
* **D: Uma kugucuka kungabangela kufa kweseli:** This is a *consequence* of some mutations, but not the primary factor determining the impact.  Some mutations can be harmless.

Therefore, the **type of mutation (germline vs. somatic)** is the key determinant of whether the mutation has a significant impact on the organism and whether it can be passed on.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini lolunikelwe endzimeni, yini imiphumela lehlukahlukene yekugucuka kwetakhi telufuto lekungakancikwa kulo?","The best answer is **A: Tingakanani takhi telufuto letitsintsekako (Number of affected germ cells)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the consequences of somatic mutations vary based on whether they occur in germline cells or not.  The key difference highlighted is the potential for germline mutations to be heritable, leading to offspring with the mutation.  Therefore, the number of germ cells affected determines the potential impact on future generations and the overall consequences.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Uma emaseli atsintsekile yi-germ-line (If the cells affected are germline):** While germline mutations are important, the question asks about the *varied* outcomes. The *number* of affected germ cells is a crucial factor in determining the overall consequences, not just whether they're germline.
* **C: Kubaluleka kwetintfo telufuto letitsintsekile (Importance of the affected tissue of the organism):**  The passage doesn't directly focus on the importance of the tissue affected. While tissue importance *could* influence the effects, it's not the primary factor discussed for the *variation* in outcomes.
* **D: Luhlobo lekugucuka lokutsintsekile (Type of mutation):** The passage doesn't detail different *types* of mutations that cause varying consequences. It focuses on where the mutation occurs (somatic vs. germline) as the key factor driving the difference in outcomes.



Therefore, **A** is the most directly supported and relevant answer based on the provided text."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungasiso sizathu sekutsi emasiko akudzala afuye timbuti?,"The correct answer is **D: Tiniketa lithuba lekutfola inyama** (They seized the opportunity to get meat).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Timbuti people preserved food (milk, hair, meat, hides) because their cultures and migrations made it easy to obtain them.  The fact that they preserved the food suggests they wanted to have a supply available, especially meat, during times when it might be scarce. Option D directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Tiniketa lithuba lekudla inyama** (They seized the opportunity to eat meat): While they likely ate meat, the preservation of food isn't *primarily* about eating it immediately. It's about storing it for later.
*   **B: Tisita ekuluseni live** (They practiced fermentation): The passage mentions using fermentation with honey, but doesn't state that this was the *reason* for preserving food. It was a method of preservation, but not the fundamental reason.
*   **C: Titsembisa bungani** (They promised friendship): This has no connection whatsoever to food preservation.

The text says: ""badlali basebentisa khona tindvuku tekuyidlala kuze bashaye **ibhola** lingene emigodzini."" This translates to ""players use playing sticks to hit the **ball** into the goals.""

Therefore, the goal is to score by hitting the ball.
"
"Ebaleni legalufu, bukuphi tjani lobujutjwe bafinyetwa?","The correct answer is **A: Embobeni yelishumi nesiphohlongo**

Here's why:

The question asks where the players are trying to get the ball *into*. The text states: ""Migodzi lelishumi nesiphohlongo ledlaliwe ngesiwombe lesivamile, nokulapho badlali bebecala emgodzini wekucala bacedze koweshumi nesiphohlongo.""  This translates to: ""The goal is the tenth and eleventh, and the game is played with a ball, and where players score in the first goal they score in the tenth and eleventh.""

Therefore, the players are trying to get the ball into the **tenth and eleventh goals (embobeni yelishumi nesiphohlongo)**.

Kuhlola kungulenye yetindlela tekususa tinkholelo lite, imibuto lesinayo ngentfotsite kuphindze kwente kutsi bososayensi babone kutsi tintfo tenteka njani...""  This means the primary goal of the scientific method is to challenge existing beliefs and assumptions.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Kute utfole kutsi umhlaba usebenta njani:** While understanding how the world works *is* a goal of science, the scientific method is specifically *how* scientists arrive at that understanding – it's the process, not just the outcome.
* **C: Kubuta imibuto:**  The scientific method does involve questioning, but its ultimate aim isn't simply to ask questions.  It's to test those questions through experimentation and observation.
* **D: Kucondzisa lucwaningo lesayensi:**  This is true, but it's a consequence of the scientific method, not its fundamental *purpose*. The purpose is *why* scientists conduct research.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengasiti kucondzisa lucwaningo lesayensi?","The correct answer is **C: Kucedza imibono lengenteka**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the scientific method is a way to ""test theories"".  The core of the scientific method involves forming a hypothesis (an educated guess), then designing experiments to *test* that hypothesis. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Indlela yesayensi yodvwa (The scientific method itself):** While the scientific method *is* the process, it's not the *reason* it drives scientific research. It's the *tool* used.
* **B: Kwenta imibono (Making ideas):** While ideation is part of science, it's not the driving force *of the research itself*.  The research is driven by testing those ideas.
* **D: Kwenta tivivinyo (Conducting experiments):**  Experiments are *part* of the scientific method, but the overall goal of the scientific method is to *test* ideas, and experiments are a key way to do that. Therefore, testing is the overarching purpose.

* **The passage states:** ""Lesiphepho besinemoya lobowugijima nga-480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)."" This directly supports option D.
* **Option A is incorrect:** While tornadoes are powerful, they don't necessarily pick up *everything* that's not bolted down.  Size and weight play a role.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The passage explicitly states tornadoes can damage *any* area, not just small ones.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The passage says some tornadoes can last for *hours*, not just hours.

The text explicitly states: ""Lesiphepho besinemoya lobowugijima nga-480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)."" This directly addresses the speed of the wind in a tornado, which is a key factor in its destructive power.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tivame kuhlala emahora langetulu kulamatsatfu** - While tornadoes *can* last over an hour, the text focuses on wind speed.
*   **C: Titsintsa tindzawo letikhulu kunaletinye yiphepho** - The text states tornadoes can destroy *everything* in their path, not necessarily that they affect larger areas than other storms.
*   **D: Tiyakhona kudzabula tihlahla phasi** - The text says tornadoes *can* pick up and throw trees, but the core question is about the speed of the wind, and option B answers that directly.

Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako labacale kukwenta bantfu eminyakeni lengu-16 ekhulwini?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwenta ma-lens**.

Here's why:

* The question states that large, powerful telescopes were developed in the 16th century. 
* The passage mentions that these telescopes had two lenses, making objects appear more distant and larger.
* The next logical step in telescope development, building upon the principle of using lenses for magnification, was to **create better lenses** to improve image quality and power. 

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Sebentisa ma-lens (Use lenses):**  They *were* using lenses, the question is about what they did *next*.
* **B: Tintfo thekukhulisa (Make things bigger):** While the goal was to make things bigger, the *method* of doing so was through lenses.
* **D: Kwenta tibonakudze (Make telescopes):**  They *were* making telescopes, the question asks what they did *after* the initial development.



"
Kunini bantfu bakhulisa tintfo basebentisa emalensi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kusukela ngasekupheleni kweminyaka lengu-16 ekhulwini.**

Kodvwa, tibonakudze mbamba tekucala takhiwa eYurophu sekuyophela likhulu leli-16 leminyaka."" This translates to ""People made and used lenses to look at distant things for thousands of years. However, the first microscope was invented in Europe around the 16th century."" Therefore, the use of lenses for viewing things began in the latter part of the 16th century.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bekavamise kuya emhumeni lobese watiwa ngukutsi yi-""""Hira"""" kuleNtsaba ye-""""Noor"""" (kukhanya) kuze ayocabanga."" This translates to: ""He used to go to the cave which was known as """"Hira"""" on the mountain of """"Noor"""" (light) to think.""

The key phrase here is ""ukuze ayocabanga"" (to think).  The cave became his place to find peace and solitude to contemplate.  This directly relates to finding peace and solitude.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umsindvo wangaphandle ungasita kucabangela (External pressures can distract from thinking):** The passage suggests the opposite – he sought a *distraction* from external pressures.
* **C: Bekadzinga sikhatsi lesincane kakhulu kuba yedvwa (He only needed very little time to be alone):**  The passage implies he needed regular, dedicated time – ""Bekavamise"" (He used to).
* **D: Bekajake kubukwa nekuvakala (He was looking for observation and recognition):** The cave was a place of seclusion, not observation or recognition.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini leyasebentiswa insimbi kwekucala?","The correct answer is **D: Tipolo (Bridges)**.

The text states: ""Kwekubopha siporo sesitimela ekucaleni kwakwentelwe kutsi kubambe siporo singagudluki."" which translates to ""A bridge was built at the beginning of the train to hold a non-turning bridge.""  The text then goes on to say that bridges were eventually built using iron.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani emasondvo esigodvo atsatselwa masondvo ensimbi?","The correct answer is **C: Bebakwati kusingatsa imitfwalo lemikhulu.**

The passage states: ""...letincola kutsi akhone kuhamba ngelitubane lelikhulu abe advonsa imitfwalo lesindzako ngalokungafani nalapho ahamba emigwacweni lemibi legcwele ematje.""  This translates to ""...which allowed them to travel long distances carrying goods and supplies, unlike when they traveled on bad roads full of mud.""

The passage then describes the problems with wooden bridges: ""Nanobe kunjalo, kwabonakala kutsi tiporo tingacina kakhulu natingaba nokusansimbi ngetulu."" (However, it was seen that wooden bridges could rot very easily and were also susceptible to being damaged by insects on top.)

Finally, it explains the solution: ""Ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi, emasondvo lakhiwe ngelikhuni atsatselwa indzawo ngulawo lakhiwe ngensimbi."" (Over time, bridges were built with stone reinforced with metal arches.)

Therefore, the primary reason for reinforcing bridges with metal was to allow them to **carry heavier loads (imitfwalo lemikhulu)**, especially considering the problems with wooden bridges rotting and being damaged by insects.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwandzisa sivinini selihhashi (Increase the amount of cattle):** The passage doesn't mention cattle at all.
*   **B: Bebabukwa njengalabasebenta kahle kakhulu (Were viewed as very efficient workers):** While efficiency might be a benefit, the passage focuses on load-bearing capacity, not worker efficiency.
*   **D: Bebagcitjwa yinsimbi kujantji (Were attacked by insects on the wheels):** This is the opposite of what the passage describes – it's trying to *prevent* insect damage.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubaphi bantfu labalolongekile emkhatsini nemkhatsi we-Romanticism?","The correct answer is **B: Umumo wemhlaba (World spirit)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""IRomanticism lokukuvumela lotsite akulawule beyincono kunemitsetfo lephocelelako leshaywa ngemagunya laphakeme.""  This implies a focus on individual feeling, intuition, and a deeper connection to the world around them.

* **The key concept in Romanticism is often tied to the idea of the ""World Spirit"" or ""Universal Spirit"" (Weltgeist in German).** Romantics believed that individuals could connect with this spirit through their emotions and imagination, transcending rigid rules and societal constraints.  This is a core element of Romantic philosophy.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Imitsetfo (Rules/Laws):** The passage *contrasts* Romanticism with rules and laws.  It doesn't suggest that rules were prominent *within* Romanticism.
* **C: Ngekwetifiso (Reason):** While reason wasn't entirely dismissed, Romanticism emphasized emotion and intuition *over* pure reason. It was a reaction *against* the Enlightenment's focus on reason.
* **D: Lisiko (Tradition/Culture):** While Romanticism *engaged* with tradition and culture, its core principle was to move *beyond* rigid adherence to tradition and embrace individual expression and feeling. It wasn't simply *about* tradition itself.



Therefore, the ""Umumo wemhlaba"" (World spirit) best encapsulates the philosophical underpinnings of Romanticism as described in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage *explicitly* states the opposite of this. It says: ""futsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """"nemtselela"""" emiphakatsini lengeyekutalwa, nekutsi buchwepheshe ekugcineni bube """""
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokungakahlangani nekudonsa umnsalo?","The correct answer is **A: Umsindvo lopholile (Relaxed tension)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a ""high pitch"" produces a relaxed tension (umsindvo lolula) and a ""low pitch"" produces a strong and firm tension (umsindvo lonemandla nalocinile). 

The question asks which option *doesn't* correlate with pulling the bow tighter (kudonsa umnsalo).  A relaxed tension is the *opposite* of pulling the bow tighter. The other options *do* relate to tension when pulling the bow:

*   **B: Luphawu lolubukeka njengesisekelo (Looks like a base):** This refers to the shape of the bow, and pulling tighter would affect its visual appearance.
*   **C: Umsindvo lonemandla (Firm tension):** This is directly related to pulling the bow tighter.
*   **D: Icala esicocweni (The bow is on the grip):** Pulling the bow tighter is how you engage the grip.



Therefore, relaxed tension (umsindvo lopholile) is the only option that doesn't correlate with pulling the bow tighter.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokuhlotjaniswa nemsindvo lopholile?","The correct answer is **B: Dvonsa butjoki**.

The text states: ""Insimbi yemculo lephakeme ngalokuvamile ikhipha umsindvo lolula, kungulapho insimbi yemculo lephansi ikhipha umsindvo lonemandla nalocinile."" (High musical iron usually produces a light sound, while the low musical iron produces a strong and firm sound.)

The phrase ""dvonsa butjoki"" (pulling the bow) relates to the low sound, which is described as strong and firm. Therefore, pulling the bow is the action associated with a firm sound.

Tinsalela tematsambo tikhombisa kutsi tandla tagcina setitayele kusebentiswa ngalokuyinhloko kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **B: Kutfwala sisindvo (Food gathering)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sandla seshimpandzi nelunyawo kuyalingana ngebukhulu nebudze, kukhombisa lomsebenti walesandla kutfwala sisindvo uma ihamba."" (The chimpanzee hand and foot are the same size and shape, indicating that the hand's function in food gathering is when it walks.)

And later: ""Tinsalela tematsambo etandla letineminyaka letigidzi letimbili kuya kuletintsatfu budzala tiyakwembula loku kusukela ekuchumeni."" (Fossil remains of hands dating back millions of years reveal this came from food gathering.)

Therefore, the fossils strongly suggest that the hand was primarily used for food gathering."
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokuchaza ngalokungiko ema-phalange emfene? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ticondzile kunebantfu’ (More refined than a chimpanzee's)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sandla semuntfu sifisha kunelunyawo, netingalo leticondzile kunetetinyawo."" This translates to ""A human hand is more refined than a foot, and its structure is more complex than a foot's.""  Option A directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tandla netinyawo tato tiyahluka ngebukhulu (Hands and feet are different in size):** While the passage *does* mention size difference, it's not the focus of the question about the *fingers*.
*   **C: Tisebentiselwa kutfwala sisindvo (They are used for grasping):** The passage states the hands were used for transport, not grasping.
*   **D: Tisebentiselwa ngalokuyinhloko yekukhohlisa (They are mainly used for deception):** This option is not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately describes the refinement of human fingers as presented in the passage."
Ukhetsa kususa kuhluka kwelufuto lolusha kuliphi licumbu?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuhlukaniswa (Separated)**.

The passage states: ""Lokukhetsa kuyakususa kulelicembu lekuhlukahlukana lokuvetiwe."" This translates to ""Selection removes this difference of the veterinary (or vaccinated) group.""  Therefore, selection separates the two groups, highlighting the difference in their future development.
"
Nguyiphi inchubo lenesibopho sekungeta kuhluka kwelufuto?,"The correct answer is **C: Kugucuka kwetakhi telufuto (Changes in the root of the plant)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kugucuka kwesimo kungeta kuhlukahlukana kwelufuto..."" which translates to ""Changes in the root cause differences in the plant's appearance..."" This directly links changes in the root to the differences in the plant's appearance (the ""lukhombise kutsi kunetigungu letimbili tetakhi telufuto: takhi letifihlakele naletivetiwe."" - it showed that there are two types of roots: hidden and exposed).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuhlukaniswa (Separation)** - While separation might be a *result* of the root changes, it's not the *cause* of the difference in appearance.
* **B: Kuhlanganisa kabusha (Rejoining/Reconnecting)** - This is the opposite of what's happening. The passage implies a separation or difference is the issue.
* **D: Kuvetiwe (Exposed)** - Exposure is a *type* of root, not the underlying cause of the difference in appearance.

"Ngekusekelwa elwatini lolusendzimeni, ngikuphi kuloku lokufanele inkawu ikudle kute icatulule “inkinga yemaprotheni”?","The correct answer is **A: Emacembe lafile**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ngakho, kudla kwetilwane (tintfutfwane, umuhlwa, emacandza) akugayeki kalula nje esiswini kuphela, kepha kunemaprotheyini lamanyenti lahlanganisa onkhe ema-amino acid. **Tonkhe tintfo letihloliwe, akukafaneli setfuke nangabe bokhokho betfu bacatulula """"tinkinga tabo"""" mhlamumbe ngendlela lefanako naleyo timfene letenta ngendlela esikhatsini setfu.**""

This implies that our ancestors figured out how to obtain proteins from animal remains (specifically, the organs and offal) to address the protein deficiency problem. Animal organs, including the intestines, liver, and kidneys, are rich in protein.  The text also mentions that animal protein is not easily digested whole, and cooking helps.  Animal remains left to decompose (emacembe lafile) would be a natural source.

The other options are less likely based on the text:

* **B: Lokusanhlavu lokuluhlata (Animal bones):** Bones contain protein, but it's less easily accessible than in organs.
* **C: Intsetse (Insects):** Insects are a protein source, but the text focuses on animal protein.
* **D: Sici setimbali (Grass seeds):** Grass seeds are primarily carbohydrates, not protein.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima,nguyiphi kuletinkinga letilandzelako lengabangela kusweleka kwema-amino acid labalulekile?","The correct answer is **A: Tinkinga tekugaya kudla (Problems with digestion)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Etindzaweni letisesigangeni, akukho melula ngetilwane letitimfene letinendlela yokugaya kudla lenjengeyebantfu kutsi tanelise ema-amino-acid ato etitjalweni letitfolakalako."" This translates to: ""In adulthood, it is not easy for animals to have a way of digesting food like humans to obtain the amino acids present in the food.""

The problem with digestion directly leads to a lack of amino acids, which is the core issue being discussed. The other options (poor appetite, abnormal growth, death) are *consequences* of the digestive problem, not the initial cause of the lack of amino acids.



"
Emalunga elusiko lelincane lelitsite ngalokuvamile akhombisa njani kuhlangana kwawo nelicembu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngekwamukela timiso temphakatsi**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how a subculture is formed by people sharing similar values and lifestyles. A key aspect of any culture, including a subculture, is its **norms** (timiso).  Subcultures often demonstrate their connection to the broader culture by adopting or adapting existing norms, even while differentiating themselves in other areas.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ngekutama kuhlanganisa (By purely joining together):**  While joining together is part of forming a subculture, it doesn't explain *how* they connect to the larger culture.
* **B: Ngekwamukela tinkholelo tawo wonkhe umuntfu lobatungeletile (By accepting everyone's beliefs who are prepared):**  The passage focuses on *shared* values, not necessarily accepting all beliefs. And the phrase ""lobatungeletile"" (who are prepared) is unclear in this context.
* **D: Ngekusebentisa sitayela ngendlela yeluphawu (By using style as a symbol):** While style *is* a symbol, it's only one aspect of connecting to the broader culture.  Adopting norms is a more fundamental connection.

Here's why:

* **The question describes a situation where children are punished and treated poorly for not being proficient in traditions, specifically related to rituals.** This creates a negative association with the rituals.
* **Option A directly addresses this negative association.**  If a child is consistently punished for not performing rituals correctly, they are likely to avoid participating in them altogether to avoid further negative treatment.
* **Options B, C, and D are less directly supported by the text.**
    * **B:** While possible, the text doesn't explicitly suggest an *increased* likelihood of ritualistic participation. The emphasis is on avoidance.
    * **C:**  There's no mention of the child being ostracized from the community.
    * **D:** While possible, the text focuses on the child's individual response to being punished, not their involvement with other groups.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the provided text.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, lwati lemntfwana nemibono yebuhlanga kungaba nemtselela kulokulokulandzelako?","The correct answer is **C: Budlelwane babo nalabanye bantfwana (Their relationships with other children)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that bullying negatively impacts how children are treated and their behavior. It specifically mentions children being looked down upon for not being good at school, and this leads to a cycle of being treated poorly. This directly affects their relationships with other children.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Idlandzana lebuhlanga lebakhetsa kutihlanganisa nabo (Bullying behavior that includes them):** While bullying *involves* the child, it doesn't directly explain the long-term impact. It's about how the bullying affects their connections with others.
* **B: Kutiphatsa kwabo (Their behavior):**  The passage mentions behavioral changes *as a result* of bullying, but the core impact is on social relationships.
* **D: Inchazelo yabo yebuhlanga (Their self-perception of their own race):** The passage focuses on *how others perceive* the child based on their race, and the subsequent effects on their relationships, not necessarily their self-perception of their race.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C**. The bullying and associated racial bias negatively affect the child's relationships with their peers."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungeke kuhambisane nekukhuliswa kwemntfwana yemuntfu wesifazane?","The text describes children labeled ""besiganga"" (meaning ""cursed"" or ""ill-fated"") who face severe social isolation, neglect, and sometimes abandonment. They may be hidden, or their parents may be unable to cope with their behavioral issues. Some are raised by animals or in orphanages. This leads to significant trauma and separation before adoption or escape. They can exhibit animalistic behaviors depending on what animal raised them.

Considering the options and the information in the text, the answer that is *least likely* to be associated with the upbringing of a child labeled ""besiganga"" is:

**B: Emakhono ekucoca lacinile (Excellent fine motor skills)**

Here's why: The text focuses on the negative impacts of trauma, neglect, and isolation. While these children *might* develop some skills, it's unlikely they would consistently demonstrate *excellent* fine motor skills. Their primary concerns would be survival, emotional regulation, and coping with a difficult environment.  The other options are all very plausible consequences:

* **A: Kuhlala ngekutimela (Living in isolation)** - This is explicitly mentioned as a key feature of their lives.
* **C: Kutsambekela lokungakatayeleki (Experiencing untrustworthy situations)** -  The text details neglect, abuse, and abandonment, leading to untrustworthy relationships and environments.
* **D: Kukhatsateka kwemphakatsi (Societal stigma)** - The label ""besiganga"" and the associated behaviors would lead to significant societal stigma and exclusion.



Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokuchaza ngalokungiko kutiphatsa kwebantfwana?","The correct answer is **B: Kutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kungabangela kusweleka kwebudlelwane.**

Here's why:

The text details how children labeled ""besiganga"" (often meaning ""odd"" or ""different"") experience significant social isolation, abandonment, and neglect.  This isolation and trauma directly leads to difficulties forming healthy relationships.  The passage highlights that these children often struggle to connect with others due to their upbringing – being hidden, abandoned, or raised in unusual circumstances (like with animals or in orphanages).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Liningi lekutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kubangwa kukhubateka ngekwemtimba:** While the text mentions children exhibiting animal-like behaviors, it's not the primary cause of their dysfunctional relationships. The core issue is the trauma of their upbringing.
*   **C: Kutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kuphela ebantfwaneni labavalelwe batali babo:** The text states that children can be abandoned or hidden by parents, but also by being raised in orphanages or with animals, indicating that it's not *only* about parental abandonment.
*   **D: Konkhe kutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kubangelwa kukhubateka lokukhulu kwengcondvo:** While emotional trauma is a huge factor, the text also points to the social isolation and unusual upbringing (e.g., with animals) contributing to their difficulties, not solely emotional trauma.

Here's why:

The passage describes subsistence farming as being primarily for self-sufficiency – feeding the family and meeting their needs.  Option A directly reflects this core principle. The other options describe commercial farming practices (selling produce, planting for profit, and moving seeds between locations), which are not characteristics of subsistence farming.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuchaza ngalokungiko kulima lotiphilisa ngako?,"The correct answer is **A: Luhlelo lemvelo ngalokuphelele (A completely natural system)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that subsistence farming is done ""ngevemulo"" (naturally) and involves using ""imbewu legciniwe letfolakale kuleyo ndzawo"" (saved seeds found in that area) and rotating crops and other simple techniques. This points to a reliance on natural processes and a self-sustaining, natural system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Isebentisa emasu lahlukile ekukhulisa titjalo (It uses different methods to grow crops):** While subsistence farming *might* use different methods, the emphasis of the passage is on simplicity and natural practices, not necessarily variety.
*   **C: Ivumela balimi kutsi babelane ngetitjalo tabo kuso sonkhe sifundza sabo (It allows farmers to share their crops with the entire community):** Sharing is a social aspect of subsistence farming, but the passage doesn't highlight that as the *defining* characteristic.
*   **D: Isebentiswa balimi kuletinye tive (It is used by farmers for other things):** This is true, subsistence farming provides food for the farmer and their family, but it doesn't describe the core *nature* of the farming itself.



"
Kuvakashela imnyuziyamu kungaba ngaphasi kwasiphi sigaba setekuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **C: Tekuvakasha kwemasiko (Cultural tourism)**.

Here's why:

The text defines cultural tourism as travel to places to learn about the history and customs of a place. Museums are places specifically dedicated to preserving and displaying cultural artifacts and history. Therefore, visiting a museum falls directly under the category of cultural tourism.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengahle ibe yintfo lehamba phambili kubahambi betekungcebeleka?","The correct answer is **C: Kubona timphawu tendzawo letibalulekile**.

Here's why:

The passage defines cultural tourism as visiting places to learn about a region's history and culture.  Therefore, the primary driver for cultural tourists is to **see the important signs (phawu) of the place's culture.**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kugcila emasikweni endzawo (Following local customs):** While important, following customs is a *result* of observing and understanding the culture, not the primary reason for seeking it out.
* **B: Kutsatsa likhefu esimisweni sabo setinsuku tonkhe (Escaping their daily routine):**  This is a general reason for travel, not specific to cultural tourism.
* **D: Kuvisisa umlandvo wendzawo (Experiencing the mood/atmosphere of the place):**  Experiencing the atmosphere is part of the cultural experience, but it's the *signs* of culture themselves that are the main focus.

Yini leshiwo indzimeni njengentfo leyasita ekunciphiseki kusaba tingucuko esontfweni lendzawo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kukhumbula tigameko letiyimpumelelo sekutiphatsa kwetemabhizinisi (Remembering successful business practices)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that by analyzing successes and failures, people gain valuable insights into goals, power dynamics, and controlling the organization. It also mentions that success stories reduce fear of change and inspire positive change.  Therefore, remembering and learning from successful business practices is presented as a key way to overcome fear and drive positive transformation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kutfola kuvisisa ebantfwini lababe nemtselela welisiko lenhlangano (Focusing on people with a cultural and organizational bias)** - The passage explicitly says that while understanding someone's cultural bias isn't the same as endorsing it, it's important to know *where* that bias influences their perspective.  This option misinterprets that point.
* **C: Kutfola emandla ekushayela enhlangano (Focusing on power to drive the organization)** - While power is mentioned, the passage isn't simply advocating for focusing on power; it's about understanding power dynamics within the context of successes and failures.
* **D: Kuvisisa umlandvo wenhlangano (Suppressing the organization's voice)** - The passage is about *understanding* the organizational voice and how it influences change, not suppressing it.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kuvisisa umlandvo wemuntfu kungasita ngani?","The correct answer is **A: Kunciphisa kusaba kushintja**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kulesimo, kucabanga ngaloko lokwenteke kutemabhizinisi nemphumela lobe khona kusita bantfu kutsi batibone tinsayeya letinsha kanye neticondziso letinsha telisontfo lendzawo. Tindzaba temphumelelo letinjena tehlisa kwesaba kushintja, esikhatsini lesifanako takha tifiso letinhle tekushintja esikhatsi lesitako.""

This translates to: ""In this situation, one thinks about what happens in businesses and the effect it has on people to see new ways and new ideas of the local journey. These concerns about success decrease the fear of change, meanwhile build good desires for change at the appropriate time.""

Therefore, controlling people's opinions *decreases the fear of change*.  The other options are not directly supported by the text.

Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako letichaza ngalokungiko indlela yekufundza yangemuva kwesimanje?,"The best answer is **A: Lokunye lokuhlangenwe nako kwekufundza kunenzuzo kakhulu kunaletinye (Other learning experiences are more beneficial than others).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that there's no single ""right"" way to learn.** It highlights the importance of active engagement and personal experience in forming understanding.
* **Option A directly aligns with this idea.** It suggests that learning isn't just about one method, but that diverse experiences contribute to a richer and more beneficial learning process. This resonates with the passage's argument against a standardized approach.
* **The other options are less relevant:**
    * **B: Kufundza kufanele kugcile itintfweni lesitsembela kutsi sitawubukana nato (Learning should be focused on what we will encounter):** While encountering things is part of learning, the passage is broader than just preparing for encounters.
    * **C: Tindlela letitsite tekufundza tincono kunaletinye (Certain methods of learning are better than others):** The passage explicitly *rejects* the idea that one method is superior to all others.
    * **D: Kute kuphelela ekufundzeni (It's over with learning):**  The passage is about continuous learning and the evolving nature of understanding, so this is the opposite of the passage's message.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate continuation of the passage's thought process.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that learning is an active process of engagement and reflection.** It explicitly states, ""Kuze ufundze kudzingeka kube nesenteko bese kulesenteko utfola sifundvo bese ke uba nelwati."" (In order to learn, you need to be engaged and in that engagement, you reflect on the lesson and then gain understanding.)
* **Option D directly contradicts this active learning principle.** It suggests that you can *use* knowledge before you have actually *learned* it. This aligns with the old way of learning the passage criticizes.
* **Options A, B, and C are all consistent with the passage's message.**
    * **A: Kunetindlela letiningi tekufundza lwati** - The passage states that learning needs to be active and reflective, implying there are multiple paths to achieving this.
    * **B: Lokunye lokuhlangenako lokufundzako kufanele kubekwe kucala kunalabanye** -  The passage emphasizes the importance of experience in the learning process.
    * **C: Sipiliyoni sekufundza sincike kumfundzi naselwatini loluthulile** - The passage also mentions that learning relies on experiences and understanding.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that doesn't reflect the modern approach to learning as described in the passage.

"Ngemuva kwekuvuka ngenhloso phakatsi nesikhatsi lesivamile sekulala, ngikuphi kuloku lokungaphatamisa inchubo yekuphatamiseka kwekulala?","The correct answer is **C: Kuvala i-alarm yakho endzaweni yakho yekulindza ebusuku bese ubuyela emuva kute ulale ngemuva kwemizuzu lengemashumi lamabili.**

Here's why:

The paragraph discusses how abruptly waking up can disrupt sleep inertia. Option C addresses this directly by suggesting a gentle re-entry into the sleep environment.  By turning off the alarm and waiting a bit, you allow your body to ease back into sleep, minimizing the disruption.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kufundza li-awa nesigamu ngaphambi kwekuphindze ulale:** While reading can be a relaxing activity, it doesn't directly address the issue of *how* you wake up and re-enter sleep.
* **B: Kusebentisa indlu yekugezela uphindze ubuyele embhedzeni:**  This is disruptive. Going to the bathroom and then back to bed will also cause sleep inertia.
* **D: Kuvuka unatse emanti lasebhodleleni etulu kwe-nightstand yakho:** This is a drastic and likely ineffective way to mitigate sleep inertia. It might even be more jarring than a regular alarm.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes disruptions to the sleep pattern.** Options A, B, and C all relate to how sleep patterns can be affected (biological rhythms, incomplete wake-ups, and established routines).
* **Option D describes a *behavior* after waking, which isn't a characteristic of a *disrupted* sleep pattern.**  While some people might nap, it's not a typical or expected outcome of a sleep disturbance. A disrupted sleep pattern is more likely to involve difficulty falling asleep, waking up frequently, or feeling unrested.

Therefore, option D is the one that *doesn't* describe a characteristic of disrupted sleep."
"Njengoba bucopho butama kuphupha ngalokungiko kaningi, yini leyandzako?","The correct answer is **D: Sikhatsi phakatsi kwesifundza se-REM**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the phenomenon of having vivid dreams and waking up frequently is linked to increased activity during REM sleep.  It specifically mentions that the frequency of dreams is related to the time spent in REM sleep.  Therefore, the increased frequency of dreams is a result of more time spent in the REM stage.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Linani letifundza te-REM:** While REM sleep frequency is a factor, the passage highlights *time spent* in REM as more directly related.
*   **B: Emazinga emandla:** While sleep quality can be influenced by various factors, the passage focuses specifically on the relationship between dream frequency and REM sleep.
*   **C: Budze besimo sekutakula:**  The passage doesn't connect dream frequency to the overall depth of the sleep state.



"
Ngumuphi kulemiphumela lemibili lelandzelako lengahle ibe nako kuphupha lokucacile emtimbeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuncishiswe ema-REM ngebusuku ngabunye (Reduced REM sleep each night)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the dreamer experiences vivid dreams (likely lucid dreams) and is awakened after watching TV.
* It also explains that vivid dreams occur during REM sleep.
* The passage directly links the ability to become aware *within* a dream (lucidity) to a *decrease* in REM sleep.  The more frequently the dreamer tries to realize they're dreaming, the less time they spend in REM sleep.
* Option B aligns perfectly with this reasoning:  *Kuncishiswe ema-REM ngebusuku ngabunye* directly reflects the consequence of frequent attempts at lucid dreaming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Budze besikhatsi lobunciphile phakatsi kwetifundza te-REM (Shorter time spent in REM sleep)** - While shorter REM sleep *can* be associated with lucid dreaming, the passage focuses on the *decrease* in REM sleep caused by frequent attempts at lucidity, not just a general shorter duration.
* **C: Kuncika ekuphupheni lokucacile (Depends on lucid dreaming)** - This is too vague. The passage explains the *relationship* between the frequency of lucid dreaming attempts and REM sleep duration.
* **D: Ema-REM akhuphuliwe ngebusuku ngabunye (Increased REM sleep each night)** - This contradicts the passage's explanation. Increased REM sleep wouldn't lead to the problem described.

The passage states: ""Emacembu ekubonana abanjwa ngendlela lesezingeni lelisetulu lelifanako nelemacembu lavamile, kepha kunekuhlukana lokukhulu. ... Kuba khona """"kwelicembu lelinemandla"""" ngekweliciniso (Larson kanye na-LaFasto, 1989, p109) kuphindze kube yincenye leyehlukile yelicembu letisebenti lelihlangana likhulume lisebentisa tintfo tebuchwepheshe. ""Lelicembu lelingabonakali"" ngulelicembu leliphetse lapho onkhe emalunga abika khona. Lelicembu lelingabonakali libekela lilunga ngalinye timiso lekufanele litilandzele.""

This translates to: ""Visible clusters are captured in a level of formality similar to common clusters, but there is a great difference. ... There is also a ""hidden cluster"" in reality, which is a different part of the cluster that interacts and communicates using technical things. The ""invisible cluster"" is the overarching cluster where all clusters report. The invisible cluster provides guidelines for each cluster.""

This indicates that both visible and invisible clusters (and therefore, the ""tayelekile"" or ""formal"" clusters and the ""abonakalako"" or ""visible"" clusters) report to a ""hidden cluster"" or overarching cluster.  Therefore, they both rely on the guidance of this invisible cluster.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Womabili emacembu kulindzeleke kutsi ente ezingeni lelifanako:** While the visible and formal clusters are at a similar level of formality, the passage emphasizes a *different* level of guidance (the hidden cluster).
*   **B: Womabili emacembu abika etsembeni lebaphatsi lelingabonakali:** This is the correct choice. Both the visible and formal clusters are reported to and guided by the overarching, invisible cluster.
*   **D: Womabili emacembu abika etsembeni lebaphatsi lelingabonakali:**  This is incorrect. The clusters do not report *to* the ""hidden cluster"" but rather receive guidance *from* it.

**Therefore, the best answer is B.**"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzimeni, ngusiphi sitatimende lesiphatselene nemacembu laphatsekako kanye nangekweliciniso lokungasilo liciniso?","The correct answer is **B: Emacembu labonakalako avame kusebenta njenge ndzawo yekuchumana kwemacembu latayelekile.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Emalunga elicembu labonakalako imvamisa asebenta njengendlela yekuchumana yalelicembu lelingokocobo lanyalo."" (Visible tokens often function as a means of communication for the underlying symbolic tokens.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emacembu latayelekile atayele kubanjelwa ezingeni lelisetulu** (Underlying tokens are typically confined to a hierarchical level): While the passage mentions a ""hierarchical level"" of tokens, it doesn't directly say that *underlying tokens* are confined to it. It focuses on the relationship between visible and underlying tokens.
* **C: Emacembu lavamile anekutimela lokuncane kunemacembu labonakalako** (Underlying tokens have less variance than visible tokens): The passage implies the opposite – that underlying tokens are *more* flexible and complex, especially when involving technical expertise.
* **D: Tikhatsi letishintjako tingazuza emacembu labonakalako** (Changing times can produce visible tokens):  While changing times *can* lead to new visible tokens, the passage doesn't directly link this to the relationship between tokens.



Therefore, option B accurately reflects the primary point the passage makes about the function of visible tokens in relation to underlying tokens."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo intfo yemicabango yalokucuketfwe lagcile kuko?,"The correct answer is **B: Kutsi imvelo yemutfu itintsintsa njani tento tabo**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on internal drives and needs.** It discusses the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory, both of which emphasize psychological factors as motivators.
* **Option B deals with environmental influence.** While environment *can* influence behavior, the passage is specifically about *internal* needs and desires as the primary drivers.  The text doesn't emphasize environmental factors as the core of the theory.
* **Options A, C, and D all relate to internal needs and motivations:**
    * **A: Tifiso letisha letenteka uma sewukhulile:**  This relates to needs and desires that develop as a person matures.
    * **C: Tidzingo tangekhatsi:** This refers to basic needs, a core component of the hierarchy of needs.
    * **D: Kuvisisa kutsandvwa bantfu:** This relates to a need for belonging and social connection.



Therefore, the statement about environmental influence is the one that *doesn't* align with the central themes of the passage."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo intfo yemtsetfo wesitsatfu?,"The correct answer is **B: Kudala imphilo nemandla phakatsi kwesitfombe (Creating life and depth within the image)**.

Here's why:

* **The question is about the characteristics of a three-point lighting setup.**  Three-point lighting is a fundamental lighting technique used in photography and video. It uses three lights to illuminate a subject:
    * **Key light:** The main light source, providing the primary illumination.
    * **Fill light:** A softer light used to fill in the shadows created by the key light.
    * **Backlight/Hair light:** Placed behind the subject, separating them from the background and adding definition.

* **Let's analyze the options:**

    * **A: Kudala sisekelo lapho sihloko singabekwa khona (Creating a foundation where the subject can be placed):**  This is a correct characteristic. The lights define the subject's form and presence.
    * **C: Kugcina sitfombe sisendzaweni letsite nalesebentako (Keeping the image on the right side and the left side):**  This isn't quite accurate. While lights are positioned on the left and right, it's more about the *relationship* between the lights and the subject, not just their placement on a side.
    * **D: Kucalisa li-order ngaphakatsi kwesitfombe (Establishing order within the image):**  This is accurate. The lights help create a sense of order, depth, and structure.
    * **B: Kudala imphilo nemandla phakatsi kwesitfombe (Creating life and depth within the image):** This is the *result* of a three-point lighting setup, *not* a fundamental characteristic *of the setup itself*.  The life and depth are created *because* of the interaction of the key, fill, and backlight.  It's a consequence, not a defining feature.

Therefore, option B is the one that doesn't accurately describe a defining characteristic of a three-point lighting setup.

Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungachazi ifomethi yesitfombe lesingu-35mm?,"The correct answer is **B: Yemukelwa yifomethi yemakhamera edijithali**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that while 35mm film is still built, its importance has decreased with the rise of digital cameras.  Digital cameras *do* use a 35mm format, but the question asks about something *not* characteristic of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isakhicitwa (Isafakwa/Sizing)** - The passage describes the physical dimensions of the 35mm format.
* **C: Ine-aspect ratio lehlukile kunemafomethi lamaningi latayelekile (Has a different aspect ratio than many other common formats)** -  The passage states that the 3:2 aspect ratio is common and aligns with many APS formats.
* **D: Ifomethi levame kakhulu emhlabeni (Is the most common format in the world)** - The passage implies its prevalence with the statement about its widespread use *before* digital cameras took over. While still used, it's not the *most* common anymore, especially with the dominance of smartphone cameras.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, njengoba bakhiciti banyuse lizinga lekukhicitwa kwemalensi, athuthukiswe njani emalensi e-zoom?","The correct answer is **A: Anelijubane lelisetulu lemalensi (They do not have a high level of lens complexity)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that manufacturers are focusing on higher complexity in lens design to achieve better focal quality and reduce aberrations. However, for zoom lenses, they're avoiding this high complexity. The reason they do this is because it can lead to poorer image quality compared to prime lenses. 

Therefore, the statement ""Anelijubane lelisetulu lemalensi"" (They do not have a high level of lens complexity) directly reflects the strategy manufacturers are taking with zoom lenses to manage image quality and complexity.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kulula kuwasebentisa etimeni tekukhanya lokuphansi (They are easy to use in low light conditions):** The passage explicitly states the opposite - zoom lenses tend to have smaller apertures, making them unsuitable for low light *without a flash*.
*   **C: Ikhuwalithi yesithombe sawo ifana nemalensi lanebudze lobugcilile (Their image quality is the same as prime lenses):** The passage states that zoom lenses often have *lower* image quality compared to prime lenses.
*   **D: Anebumatima lobuncane bekugcila kunemalensi laphambili (They have less chromatic aberration than prime lenses):** The passage points out that zoom lenses can suffer from chromatic aberration (color fringing) and tend to have smaller apertures, which exacerbates this problem.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini lolusendzimeni, kunini lapho I-zoom lensi ingahle ikhetse khona kune-prime lens?","The correct answer is **A: uma imbobo lesetulu ibalulekile (when image stabilization is important)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lokunye lokungasikahle ngemalensi ekuzuma kutsi lesivinini sawo sivamise kuba sincane."" (Another drawback of zoom lenses is that their aperture is often smaller.)  A smaller aperture means less light enters the lens.
* **This then leads to:** ""...ngakho emalensi langakaduli kube matima kuwasebentisa etindzaweni letinekukhanya lokuncane ngaphandle kwe-flash."" (...therefore, short lenses are dim to use in low-light situations without a flash.)
* **Image stabilization (IS)** is a feature found in many zoom lenses to combat the blurring that can occur due to camera shake, especially in low light where the lens aperture is smaller. If image stabilization is important, a zoom lens *might* be chosen over a prime lens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uma ufuna sici selensi lesincane (If you want a small lens):**  While some zoom lenses are relatively compact, prime lenses are generally smaller and lighter.
* **C: uma ungafuni kusebentisa kukhanya endzaweni lemnyama (If you don't want to use a flash in a dark place):** The passage says zoom lenses are *dim* in low light, so this isn't a reason to choose them.
* **D: Uma ubuka bumatima lobukhulu lobugcilile (If you want to shoot wide and zoomed in):**  While zoom lenses offer versatility, prime lenses are generally better for specific focal lengths and can offer superior image quality.  The passage doesn't directly support this option.

Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungeke kutsatfwe njenge nchazelo lekungiyo ye-Mysticism?,"The correct answer is **B: Balandzeli be-mysticism bafuna kucaphela liciniso lelingekwemoya (Mystics do not seek to grasp non-spiritual truths)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines mysticism as a search for direct experience of the divine, ultimate reality, or spiritual truth.**  It emphasizes inward experience and transcendence. 
* **Option B directly contradicts this definition.** Mystics aren't interested in grasping *non-spiritual* truths. They are focused on spiritual truths.
* **Options A, C, and D align with the definition.**
    * **A:**  Mysticism *does* involve seeking peaceful and joyful states of consciousness.
    * **C:**  Mystics *do* often engage in esoteric practices to facilitate spiritual growth.
    * **D:**  The passage explicitly states that the pursuit of spiritual experience is a common thread among various faiths and practices associated with mysticism.



Therefore, option B is the statement that *cannot* be accurately described as a characteristic of mysticism, according to the passage.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo ingcikitsi ye-Mysticism?","The correct answer is **A: Kufuna imiva ibe ngekweliciniso (Seeking to make the phenomenal world real)**.

Here's why:

* **Mysticism, as described in the text, is about transcending the ordinary world to connect with the divine or ultimate reality.** It's about experiencing a deeper truth beyond the material.
* **Option A directly contradicts this.**  Mysticism isn't about trying to *make* the physical world ""real"" in a different sense. It's about seeing through it to something more fundamental.
* **Options B, C, and D align with mystical tendencies:**
    * **B: Kulandzelela kucondza ngekusebentisa lokwebiwe, sipiliyoni semphakatsi (Seeking to connect through the use of the body, personal experience):** Mystics often utilize practices like meditation and sensory experiences to facilitate connection.
    * **C: Kugcizelela esimeni lesijabulakos ekucaphela (Emphasizing joyful states of contemplation):**  Mystical experiences are frequently characterized by profound joy and bliss.
    * **D: Kulandzelela kwati ngaNkulunkulu (Seeking the divine):** This is the core aim of many mystical paths.



Therefore, the only option that doesn't fit the definition of mysticism, based on the text, is the one focused on trying to validate the phenomenal world.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lokungenteka kutsi wacala umphakatsi wetekulima?","The correct answer is **C: Bantfu base Maori lababuya ePolynesia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sikhatsi lesidze ngelikhulu lesi-19 nelesi-20, bekukholelwa kutsi takhamuti taseNew Zealand bekungemaMaori..."" This indicates that the initial belief was that Maori people from Polynesia arrived in New Zealand and established the agricultural society. While the text later presents a different theory about the Moriori, the initial and widely held belief, as stated in the passage, attributes the establishment of the agricultural society to returning Maori from Polynesia.
"
"Ngakusho kwendzima, licembu lebelitingela ema-moas belibantfu bekucala labahlala kuyiphi indzawo?","The correct answer is **B: E-New Zealand**.

The text states: ""Sikhatsi lesidze ngelikhulu lesi-19 nelesi-20, bekukholelwa kutsi takhamuti taseNew Zealand bekungemaMaori..."" (During the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the New Zealand population was non-Maori...). This indicates the belief was that the people (who hunted the moas) were in New Zealand. The text then goes on to discuss the Moriori, who were later discovered to be descendants of Maori who migrated to the Chatham Islands.

Kusiphi simo lapho kusebentisa indlela ye-Pureland ye-origami kungazuzisa ifolda?,"The correct answer is **A: Umgoci ukhetsa kwenta kugoca ngalokuphindza phindziwe ngesikhatsi sinye.**

Here's why:

The provided text describes the ""Pureland"" origami folding method as a sequential process where one object is folded at a time. Option A directly reflects this description: ""Umugoci ukhetsa kwenta kugoca ngalokuphindza phindziwe ngesikhatsi sinye"" translates to ""The folder chooses to fold repeatedly at the same time.""  This implies the method emphasizes folding one piece at a time, and potentially re-folding it multiple times to achieve the desired result.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umgoci unemakhono latfutfukile ekusebentisa imisipha.** (The folder has advanced skills in using creases.) While creases are *part* of origami, the text doesn't specifically focus on advanced crease-making skills as the defining characteristic of the Pureland method.

* **C: Umgoci wakha i-origami ledzinga kugocwa ibuyele emuva.** (The folder builds origami that requires folding backwards.) The text explicitly states that folding ""uyise emuva atikavumeleki"" (folding backwards is not allowed) in the Pureland method.

* **D: Umgcoci ukutame kanye noma kabili ngaphambilini.** (The folder taps once or twice beforehand.)  The text doesn't mention tapping or any pre-folding steps.

Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately captures the core principle of the Pureland origami folding method as described in the text.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungachazi ngalokungiko i-origami yase-Pureland?,"The correct answer is **D: Kuyindlela lenhle yekugcogca lenemakhono lalinganiselwe emoto.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states that the origami technique, developed by John Smith in the 1970s, was designed for people with limited experience and skills.**  Therefore, it wasn't necessarily considered a ""beautiful"" or advanced technique.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned or implied in the text:

* **A: Ihloselwe emafolida lanelwati (Intended for folded paper):** The text describes a technique for *folding* paper.
* **B: Indlela iyifaki kugcogca lokubuyela emuva (The method includes reverse folding):** The text specifically says ""kugoca uyise emuva atikavumeleki"" (reverse folding is not allowed).  This implies reverse folding is *not* part of this technique.
* **C: Kugcogca kufanele kuba nendzawo lecondze phambili (The fold should have a slanted edge forward):** While not explicitly stated, the description of the technique suggests a specific folding approach, and the slanted edge is a likely characteristic of a particular fold.



Therefore, option D is the only statement directly contradicted by the provided text.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi indzawo lengakahlangani ne-Indus Valley Civilization?","The correct answer is **B: Umfula i-Sarasvati**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ngisho noma letinye tifundziswa ticabanga kutsi njengoba imphucuko yayikhona ngesikhatsi seMfula i-Sarasvati losewasha..."" This implies that while the Sarasvati River *might* have played a role, the Indus Valley Civilization wasn't *only* centered around it. The civilization's core development is linked to the Indus River.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Harappa:** Harappa is a major city and a key site of the Indus Valley Civilization.
* **C: Tonkhe tifundza enyakatho-mpumalanga Afghanistan:** The passage explicitly states the civilization encompassed parts of northern Afghanistan.
* **D: Liningi lePakistan yanamuhla:** The passage states the civilization covered most of modern-day Pakistan.



Therefore, the Sarasvati River is the one option that isn't directly connected to the civilization's geographical extent in the way the others are.

Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakabalwa njengeligama lekungaba ngilo libe le-Bronze Civilization lecocwe kulendzima?,"The correct answer is **D: yi-Indus Valley Civilization**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Indus Valley Civilization"" is the term used to describe the development of the Bronze Age and the rise of a civilization in the Indus River valley.  While other terms are mentioned, the question asks which one *wouldn't* be considered a suitable name for the Bronze Civilization.  Since ""Indus Valley Civilization"" is the primary and most widely accepted term, it's the one that *would* be considered. The other options are all valid or alternative names used to describe the same civilization.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuletsa inzuzo yesikhatsi eceleni?","The correct answer is **A: Kuhambisana nalabanye (Collaborate with others)**.

Here's why:

The prompt states that people are succeeding by working *together* and that the best thing to do right now is to work *together*. The question asks what's the next step to gain time-saving benefits.  Collaboration directly aligns with the stated success and opportunity for time-saving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kubeka titsakaselo temuntfu phambili (Prioritize individual gains):** This is the opposite of the prompt's emphasis on working together for mutual benefit.
* **C: Gcizelela loko lokungazuzisa lidlandzana ngetulu kwalabaningi (Focus on what doesn't benefit the community over others):** This is selfish and counterproductive to the idea of shared success.
* **D: Kucaphela kutsi kuhala kungaba yinzuzo (Ignore that mistakes can be beneficial):**  While learning from mistakes can be beneficial, it's not the primary next step for *time-saving* gains as emphasized in the context. Collaboration is the direct answer.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako umuntfu langahle akubeke phambili uma kugcila kwakhe kusetinzunzweni tanyalo.","The correct answer is **B: Kusebentisana (Collaboration)**.

Here's why:

* **The first statement** emphasizes the importance of working together (kanyekanye) to achieve significant gains. It mentions that many people are realizing that collaboration is the best approach.
* **The second question** asks what someone should prioritize when facing challenges and emotional distress.  The underlying implication is to find a solution and overcome the difficulty. 
* **Kusebentisana (Collaboration)** is the most logical answer.  When facing emotional distress and challenges, leaning on others and working together to find a solution is a healthy and effective approach.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Kutidzela (Withdrawal):**  Withdrawal is generally *not* a helpful response to challenges. It can exacerbate emotional distress.
* **Kubambisana (Cooperation):** While cooperation is good, it doesn't necessarily imply the deep, active working together needed to overcome a difficult situation. Collaboration is a more active form of cooperation.
* **Bugovu (Greed/Selfishness):**  Greed is the *opposite* of what's needed when dealing with emotional challenges. It's unlikely to lead to positive outcomes.



Therefore, **Kusebentisana (Collaboration)** best aligns with the overall message of the text and the context of the question.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lohlanganise incenye lenkhulu yetindleko tempi?","The correct answer is **B: Emabhange e-Wall Street**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the profits from this exploitation were ""realized during the exchange of people"" and that the ""significant profit"" was achieved through the exploitation of Filipinos and the extraction of money. It also mentions the connection to Wall Street. This strongly suggests that Wall Street banks were the primary beneficiaries of the financial exploitation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hulumende wema-Philippine** - The Philippine government was being exploited, not benefiting from the profits.
*   **C: Umbuso wemakoloni wase-U.S** - While the U.S. colonial government facilitated the exploitation, the primary beneficiaries of the profits were the financial institutions in Wall Street.
*   **D: Bantfu base-Filipino** - The Filipinos were the ones being exploited, not the ones accumulating the profits.

Therefore, the passage clearly points to Wall Street banks as the entity that benefited most from the financial exploitation described."
Ngusiphi sikhatsi lesafika ngaphambi kweminyaka yema-Templars?,"The correct answer is **C: Kminyaka lesekucaleni nemkhatsi**.

Here's why:

* The provided text states that the High Middle Ages (when the Templars were prominent) occurred between AD 1000 and 1300.
* The text also says the High Middle Ages *preceded* the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
* Therefore, the time period *before* the Templars' rise (during the High Middle Ages) falls within ""Kminyaka lesekucaleni nemkhatsi"" (Early Middle Ages).
"
Ngusiphi sikhatsi lesafika ngemuva kweminyaka yema-Templars?,"The correct answer is **A: i-Late Middle Ages**.

The text explicitly states: ""EmaHigh Middle Ages andvulela emaEarly Middle Ages alandzelwa ngemaLate Middle Ages..."" which translates to ""The High Middle Ages opened up to the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages...""

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that doctors used ""scopolamine lephuma embewini yesitjalo se-herbane"" (scopolamine from the root of the henbane plant) as a sedative. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kulapha i-post traumatic stress disorder ngemitsi ledzambisa imicabango lehlukene** - The text doesn't mention anything about treating PTSD or using techniques to separate thoughts.
* **C: Kuvimbela kugeleta kwengati ngema-arterial clamps** - While the Romans were skilled in surgery, the text does not mention arterial clamps. This is a modern surgical tool.
* **D: Kwenta kuncunywa ketitfo temtimba wetiguli letibolako** - The text does not mention this practice.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text is the use of henbane root (scopolamine) as a sedative.

"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakadzalulwa intfutfuko leyentiwe emkhakheni wetekulapha ngesikhatsi sembuso waseRoma?","The correct answer is **C: Kwakhiwa kwetibhedlela tekufundza (The building of teaching hospitals)**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions the Romans developed medical knowledge, had a medical corps, and used various medicinal plants. It also states they achieved great success in medicine and built many institutions that exist today.  While the other options might be related to the development of medicine, the passage *specifically* implies the creation of institutions for learning and practice.  Teaching hospitals are a direct result of this progression.

*   **A: Kwakhiwa kweNhlangano yeTekulapha (The building of a medical association):** The passage speaks of the medical corps, which is a more structured organization than a general medical association.
*   **B: Inchubomgomo yetetimpi yembuso lenelulaka (A royal temple pharmacy with advanced knowledge):**  The passage mentions medicinal plants and the use of them, but doesn't indicate a highly advanced pharmacy in a temple.
*   **D: Kucashwa kwabodokotela yiNkhosi (The imprisonment of doctors by the king):** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests – the Romans *supported* and utilized doctors.



Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the information provided is that the Romans built teaching hospitals to further their medical knowledge and practice."
Lincike tukwani likhono lekubona?,"The correct answer is **B: Tidzingo tentfo lephilako**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the complexity and different structures of the eye.** It states that different structures have different abilities, perceive different wavelengths of light, and have varying levels of sensitivity. This all points to the biological aspects of the eye and its function within a living organism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Titfo tesimiso yemiva yekubona** - This is too specific. While the eye is related to the ""structure of the eye,"" the passage is describing the *ability* to see, not just the physical components.
* **C: Kuvakala kwebudze lobutsite beligagasi** - This refers to hearing and is completely unrelated to the passage's topic.
* **D: Emazinga e-acuity lahlukahlukene** - While the passage mentions different levels of sensitivity, ""acuity"" (sharpness of vision) is just *one aspect* of the overall visual ability. The passage is broader than just sharpness.

Therefore, the most encompassing and accurate answer is **B: Tidzingo tentfo lephilako** (Biological aspects of a living organism).
"
Kuhluka kwesakhiwo semehlo phakatsi kwetintfo letiphilako kuncike kuphi?,"The correct answer is **C: Lizinga le-acuity**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kubona, noma likhono lekubona kushiyana etintfweni letisebentisa imiva yekubona noma emehlo... Letakhiwo letihlukahlukene tinemazinga lahlukahlukene ebucili...""  This directly links the different structures of the eye to different levels of visual acuity (sharpness).  ""Acuity"" refers to the ability to distinguish fine details.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Budze beligagasi (Blood pressure):**  Blood pressure is related to cardiovascular health, not directly to the structural differences in the eye that determine vision.
* **B: Tidzingo temtimba (Nutritional needs):** Nutritional needs are important for overall health, but they don't directly dictate the specific structural variations in the eye related to visual acuity.
* **D: Bumatima bemtimba (Muscle mass):** Muscle mass relates to strength and physical performance, not directly to the eye's structural differences and visual acuity.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Lenkholo yatfolakala ngelikhulu lesi-15 itfolwa ngu-Guru Nanak (1469–1539)."" This highlights the crucial role of Guru Nanak in the development and establishment of Sikhism. The passage goes on to say it ""Yachubeka ikhona iminyaka leyimfica,"" indicating subsequent teachings solidified the faith.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: I-Sikhism beyimphumela wekuhlukana kwemahlalo phakatsi kwelisiko lema-Hindu:** While the passage acknowledges Sikhism originated from Hinduism and diverged, it doesn't frame it *solely* as a result of conflict. It emphasizes a spiritual evolution.
* **B: I-guru isici lesibalulekile lesingakavami ku-Sikhism:**  The passage states gurus are *fundamental* to Sikhism, not uncommon.
* **D: Emasiko latsite eSikhism asekelwe ku-Hinduism:** The passage indicates Sikhism *diverged* from Hinduism and created its own distinct beliefs.

Lenkholo yatfolakala ngelikhulu lesi-15 itfolwa ngu-Guru Nanak (1469–1539).""

This means the teachings of the Gurus, particularly Guru Nanak, are the foundation and defining characteristic of Sikh faith.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emasiko ema-Hindu (Hindu customs):** While Sikhism originated from Hinduism and shares some roots, it's distinct and not defined by Hindu customs. The passage states that Sikhs distance themselves from certain Hindu customs.
*   **C: Kwala kuvuma letinye tinkholo temandiya (Agreement with other Hindu beliefs):**  Sikhism doesn't simply agree with other Hindu beliefs; it has its own unique beliefs and practices.
*   **D: Kukhuluma si-Punjabi (Speaking Punjabi):** Speaking Punjabi is a cultural aspect, not a core tenet of Sikh faith itself. While Guru Nanak preached in Punjabi, the language itself isn't central to the belief system.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani bantfwana labanenkinga yekuswela Kunakwa Lokungentek Kube Matima Kugcila kuyo?","The correct answer is **A: Umsebenti wesikolo (Schoolwork)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bantfwana labane-ADD bakutfola kumantima kugcila etintfweni letifana nemsebenti wesikolwa..."" (Children with ADD struggle to focus on tasks similar to schoolwork...). This directly links difficulty concentrating to schoolwork.

While the text mentions children with ADD can focus on enjoyable activities, it highlights the *difficulty* with schoolwork as a core characteristic of ADD and its impact on concentration.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani bantfwana labanenkinga Yekunaka bavame kutibandzakanya ekutiphatseni lokuyingoti?","The correct answer is **C: Kute batfole kunakwa batali babo** (To get attention from their parents).

Here's why:

The text states that children with ADD often get into major conflicts because they ""make things gold, they argue, and resist authority."" This behavior is linked to them having difficulty with typical ways of communicating their needs and frustrations.  Getting into trouble, even negative attention, can be a way for them to be noticed and acknowledged by their parents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kwehlisa kusebenta kakhulu (To reduce overwork):** This isn't directly linked to the behavior described. While ADD can impact work habits, the text focuses on conflict and seeking attention.
* **B: Kubasita bahlangane nabontsanga (To force themselves to meet other people):**  The text doesn't suggest that these children are trying to socialize.  Their behavior seems more related to expressing internal struggles.
* **D: Kuvuselela bucopho (To revive the spirit):** While attention *might* feel good, the behavior is more about a need for validation and being heard, rather than a general ""revival of spirit.""

"Ngekusekela elwatini lelisendzimeni, ngukuphi kuloku lokungasiso sibonelo sekwenta sikafu?","The correct answer is **A: Sifundvo ekucaleni kwemdlalo wangcondvo mshini (Early machine learning game studies)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a ""Virtual Scaffold""**: This is a support system that provides guidance and scaffolding for learners. It's a method of personalized support, not just delivering information.
* **The passage mentions technology**:  The ""Virtual Scaffold"" is implemented within software, specifically mentioning Microsoft Office as a tool. It utilizes virtual scaffolds *within* that software.
* **Early machine learning game studies fit this description**:  These studies often use software to provide learners with interactive, step-by-step guidance as they explore machine learning concepts.  They use technology to scaffold the learning experience.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Umfundzisi we-SAT (SAT Tutor):**  While a tutor provides support, the passage emphasizes the structured, technology-embedded nature of the ""Virtual Scaffold.""  A standard SAT tutor might not have this level of technological integration.
* **C: Luhlelo lekufundza lelitimele (Independent learning program):** Independent learning programs *don't* typically provide the kind of scaffolding described in the passage. They focus on learner autonomy, not structured support.
* **D: Umceceshi weligi lencane (Little league coach):** A little league coach provides support, but again, it's usually more informal and less tech-integrated than the ""Virtual Scaffold.""



Therefore, the ""Early machine learning game studies"" are the best example of a situation where a Virtual Scaffold, as described in the passage, would be used.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungawuchazi kahle umcondvo wekwenta sikafu?,"The correct answer is **B: Kulusito kakhulu kunendlela yekufundza (It's too much like a learning method)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that a virtual scaffold isn't just a teaching method; it's a *support system*.  It's about providing personalized guidance and a framework for learning, not simply delivering information like a traditional lecture or method.  Option B highlights the core difference - it's *not* just a learning method. The scaffold *supports* learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tikafu tingabakhona cishe (Scaffolds can almost be absent):** While a scaffold *could* be missing, the text focuses on its presence as a valuable support.  The text doesn't say it's almost absent.
* **C: Kwatiwa nangekutsi kufundza lokusekelwe kumaphrojekti (It's considered based on project-based learning):**  The text *does* mention project-based learning (using software and creating new work) as something scaffolds support.
* **D: Tikafu tisebentiselwa kuniketa kwesekwa ekucaleni kwesipiliyoni sekufundza (Scaffolds are used to provide support guidance at the beginning of the learning experience):** This is very accurate, and directly supported by the text's description of scaffolds and virtual scaffolds.



Therefore, option B best captures the central point about what a virtual scaffold *isn't*: just another learning technique. It's a supportive system woven into the learning process.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sici seMySpace lesingazuzisa bafundzi labanenkinga yekufundza?","The correct answer is **A: Kwenta ngekufisa (Customization)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kungalungiswa kuze kwentiwe kube lula kukufundza futsi kufakwe umbala lotsite ngendlela lokufiswe ngayo."" This means MySpace allowed users to customize the site's appearance to make it easier to read and visually appealing.  This customization option would be highly beneficial for students with learning difficulties, as they could tailor the site to their specific needs.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Emabhulogi (Blogs):** While blogs are a feature, they don't directly address learning difficulties.
* **C: Likheli lewebhu lelilodvwa (The web address itself):**  While a simple web address is good for memorability, it doesn't help with reading difficulties.
* **D: Emaphrofayili latingidzi letingu-54 (The 54 million profiles):** The sheer number of profiles doesn't relate to helping students with learning challenges. It speaks more to the site's popularity.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungasiyo incenye yemphendvulo ya-Krushchev esibhebheni sesisebenti?","The correct answer is **B: Sebentisa emathangi kubuyisela ema-oda (Use tanks to restore order)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Krushchev initially responded to the Polish uprising with military force to regain control.  Using tanks to quell the uprising *is* part of the initial response. 
* However, the passage *also* says that Krushchev eventually backed down, made concessions, and allowed for the appointment of a new leader (Gomulka) and addressed demands related to religion. 

Therefore, the option that represents something *not* part of Krushchev's eventual response is using tanks to restore order - it was the initial action, not the ultimate outcome.

Here's why the other options *are* part of the response:

* **A: Khetsa indvunankhulu lesha (Appoint a new leader):**  Krushchev did appoint Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new leader.
* **C: Kwandzisa kunciphiswa kwemholo (Increase wage cuts):** The passage explicitly mentions that Krushchev initially tried to address the economic issues through wage cuts.
* **D: Mukela letinye tidzingo temnotfo (Meet other religious demands):** Krushchev did concede to demands related to religion.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo imbangela yeluthuli ePoland?,"The correct answer is **A: Bukhomanisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the initial protests in Poland were sparked by food shortages and price increases, but they *transformed* into a protest *against* communism.  Krushchev's response, while initially forceful, ultimately led to concessions. The appointment of Gomulka was a result of these concessions.

Therefore, **communism** was the underlying system that the protests were directed *against*, and the passage implies that it remained a significant issue despite the temporary easing of tensions. The other options (food shortages, price increases, and Gomulka's appointment) were *factors* in the events but not the core reason for a lasting peace."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakatsintsi budlelwane phakatsi kwe-USSR kanye ne-USA?","The correct answer is **B: Imibono mayelana ne-Germany**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the unusual end of the war and cultural exchange between the USSR and the USA initially fostered a period of cooperation. However, the passage then implies that disagreements arose. The question asks about the *next* major obstacle to their relationship.

The passage mentions the USSR and USA being allies for a time, then the Cold War and the long-lasting effects of it. The *core* difference and major point of contention after WWII, which fundamentally shaped the Cold War, was the conflicting visions for the future of post-war Germany.  The Soviets wanted a communist Germany under their influence, while the Western Allies (including the US) wanted a democratic and capitalist Germany.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *next* major obstacle:

*   **A: Umehluko wemasiko (Cultural differences):** While cultural differences existed, they were not the primary catalyst for the Cold War. They were more of a contributing factor.
*   **C: Tinchubo letiphikisanako (Conflicting ideologies):** Conflicting ideologies (communism vs. capitalism) were at the root of the Cold War, but the *specific manifestation* of those ideologies and the battleground for them *centered around Germany.*
*   **D: Tingcabano mayelana netinhlelo (Disagreements about plans):** Disagreements about plans definitely happened, but these were largely linked to the broader ideological struggle and the German issue.



Therefore, the differing visions for Germany represent the most significant and direct obstacle to a continuing positive relationship between the USSR and the USA *after* the initial period of cooperation described in the passage.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungachazi ngalokungiko inhloso yekutfumela imiva emtimbeni wonkhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Gwema tinsongo temtimba letingaba khona**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the purpose is to protect the tree from damage.** Options A, B, and C all relate to controlling or maintaining the tree's health and stability, which are ways to protect it.
* **Option D focuses specifically on avoiding potential threats (damage).** While avoiding damage is a consequence of protecting the tree, the passage's primary goal is broader than just avoiding threats. It's about the active role of the tree's defenses in *preventing* damage.

Therefore, option D is the least accurate description of the tree's purpose as described in the passage.
"
Yini lengatfilakala e-The Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Tonkhe timangaliso letidikhombisa** (All the wonders that show us the past).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I-Giza Plateau, nobe i""Giza Necropolis"" Endzaweni yalabafile eGibhithe inema-pyramid lamanyentana (lawo i-great pyramid kungiyo lenkhulu kunawo onkhe), emathuna lamancane lamanyentana, emathempeli lamanyentana, neSphinz lenkhulu."" This translates to: ""The Giza Plateau, also known as the ""Giza Necropolis,"" is a burial place in Egypt that has several pyramids (including the great pyramid, which is the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.""

Option C encompasses all these elements mentioned in the passage, making it the most accurate answer. While options A, B, and D are all *things* found at the plateau, option C is the broadest and most encompassing description of what the plateau *contains* and *represents*.
"
Bekuyini inhloso ye-Phiramidi Lekhulu?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuhlonipha Pharaor (To honor the Pharaoh)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""I-pyramid lenkhulu yakhiwelwa kuhlonipha Faro Khufu..."" which translates to ""The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...""
"
Ngubani lonesibopho ngelwati letfu lemshiseli lowacekela phasi lithempeli?,"The correct answer is **A: Be-Ephesia**.

The passage states: ""Base-Efesu, batfukutsele, bamemetela kutsi ligama laHerostratus lingaphindze libhalwe.""  This means the people of Ephesus (be-Ephesia) were outraged and wanted to prevent Herostratus's name from being remembered, which ultimately led to the rebuilding of the temple.  While Alexander the Great funded a rebuilding effort, the initial desire to commemorate the temple arose from the Ephesians' anger over the arson."
Ngukuphi lokunenkhulumo lekungiyo ngalokuphatselane nekwakhiwa kabusha kwelithempeli la-Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Yakhiwe kabusha ngemuva kwekuphatsa kwa-Alexander Lomkhulu**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Inkhosi Alekzanda yanikela yatsi italakha kabusha lithempeli, kodvwa umnikelo wayo waliwa. Ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi, ngemuva kwekuphatsa kwa-Alekzanda, lithempeli lakhiwa kabusha nga-323 BCE."" (King Alexander offered to rebuild the temple, but his gift was thwarted. Over time, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kwakhiwa kabusha kwabhadalwa ngu-Alexander Lomkhulu:** While Alexander offered to pay, his offer was not fulfilled.
* **C: I-Herostatus yayalelwa kutsi ibukane netindleko tekwakha kabusha:** The passage doesn't mention Herostratus being held responsible for the rebuilding costs.
* **D: Yakhiwe kabusha ngo-320 BCE:** The passage states it was rebuilt in 323 BCE.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kwacala nini kutsi luhlobo lolutsite lahamba ngemilente lemibili?","The correct answer is **D: Iminyaka leyitigidzi letine 4.2 leyandlula**.

The text states: ""Imisebenti ye-Bipedal yatfolaka etinsaleleni te-Australopithecus kusuka eminyakeni lengetulu kwetigidzi letingu-4.2-3.9 lesidlulile."" This directly translates to ""Bipedal locomotion appeared in the remains of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago."" Therefore, the earliest evidence of bipedalism in Australopithecus is around 4.2 million years ago.
"
Ngutiphi kuletilwane letivame kuhamba ngetinyawo letimbili?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Sahelanthropus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""nanobe iSahelanthropus kungenteka kutsi yayihamba ngetinyawo letimbili ekucaleni kweminyakeni letigidzi letisikhombisa letindlulile."" (however, *Sahelanthropus* might have walked on two legs at the very beginning of the earliest million years).

The passage also mentions *Homo Erectus*, *Australopithecus*, and the evolution of bipedalism in them. However, *Sahelanthropus* is specifically mentioned as a potential early bipedal species. Therefore, it is the best answer.
"
Yini lebeyizama kufezwa mabutho etimpi asemantini aseJalimani phakatsi nempi yelive yesibili?,"The correct answer is **A: Kivimba timphahla letibuya eBritain.**

The passage states that the German military used U-boats to ""katama kuvimba siminyaminya"" (blockade shipping) in the Atlantic Ocean.  The goal was to prevent supplies from reaching Britain.  The other options are incorrect because the passage doesn't mention preventing people or supplies from being transported across the Atlantic, or preventing the US from receiving supplies. The focus was on blocking the *shipping* to Britain.
"
Ngalokusekelwe elwatini loluniketwe endzimeni lophumelele kakhulu ngetimpi taselwandle phakatsi nemkhankaso weNyakatho ye-Atlantic?,"The correct answer is **D: Ema-Britain**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""EMamelika bekazama kuhambisa bantfu netintfo kusebentisa i-Atlantic Ocean kuseya i-Brithani."" and ""Kube iBhrithani beyite balekeleli iJalimane ngabe yayincoba njengoba yakhona kuncoba lamanye emave aseYurophu.""  This highlights that the British were the primary target and beneficiary of the successful Atlantic campaign, and their survival was crucial to the Allied war effort.  While the US played a vital role, the passage emphasizes Britain's position as the destination and the nation at risk.
"
Kungani belingekho lapho ema-Assyrian acalisa kusebentiswa kwe-Calvary?,"The correct answer is **A: Emahhashi (Cows)**.

The passage states that the Assyrian army initially used **cows** as mounts for their cavalry, but this was later replaced by horses.  The question asks why they *didn't* use cavalry. The passage implies they *did* use cavalry (with cows) and then switched. The other options (donkeys, chariots, and camels) aren't mentioned in the text as reasons for *not* using cavalry.
"
Tinjani timpi letisebentisa i-Calvary?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngelihhashi**

The passage explicitly states that the Assyrians used cavalry, which are soldiers who fight on horses. The passage also mentions that they trained horses for warfare and used them as a platform for their soldiers.
"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, bowungeke suitable sakhamuti sase-Babylonian lesivamile?","The correct answer is **C: Umcimbi logcekeni lelithempeli (Temple ceremony)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Babylonians brought offerings to their gods and priests **""using ceremonies and times of remembrance.""** This directly links ceremonies to temple worship.
* Options A and B (bringing offerings and attending ceremonies) are both explicitly mentioned in the passage as actions performed at temples.
* Option D is incorrect because the passage describes offerings being brought *to* the temple, not *to the home*.

Therefore, a ""temple ceremony"" is a very suitable and commonly practiced activity within the Babylonian temple setting, according to the provided text.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lobekuhloselwe bafundisi ngalokukhetsekile?,"The correct answer is **A: Imikhosi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bantfu bebaletsa iminikelo kulabonkulunkulu bese baphristi betama kunaka letidzingo tabonkulunkulu basebentisa **emicimbi** kanye netikhatsi tekukhumbula lokutsite.""  And it further says that temples had a raised platform where only priests could enter. Considering this context, the ""events"" or celebrations that the priests would preside over and be বিশেষভাবে involved in would be religious ceremonies or **immkhosi** (which translates to festival/ceremony in Swati).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Tindzawo taphakatsi letincwele (Lower sacred places):** The passage describes the temple as a sacred place, not something lower.
*   **C: Imicimbi (Events):** While the passage *mentions* events, it doesn't say they were specifically for priests. The priests *used* events, but they were a part of the broader religious practice.
*   **D: Ema-Ziggurats (Ziggurats):** Ziggurats were part of the temple structure, specifically the raised platform, and not where priests would hold ceremonies. They were more like the physical space.



"
Inkosi Tutankhamun waluzuza nini ludumo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemuva kwekutholwa kwelithuna lakhe.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Kutfolakala kwelithuna lakhe nga-1922 kwamenta waba ngulodvumile."" (It was discovered in 1922 that he became famous.) This directly links his rise to fame with the discovery of his tomb.
"
Yini leyenta Inkosi Tutankhamun waba yinkosi yaseGibhithe leyatiwa kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Kutfolakala kwelithula lakhe lelingakaphatamiswa (The discovery of his largely untouched tomb)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Tutankhamun wasn't considered particularly important during his lifetime and wasn't written about in historical records.
* The key factor in his fame is that his tomb was discovered in 1922 and was remarkably intact. This discovery revealed a wealth of artifacts and provided unprecedented insight into ancient Egyptian royalty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Simo sakhe ehlwini lemakhosi asendvulo (His status in ancient royal lists):** The passage states he wasn't prominent in these lists.
* **C: Kuphangwa kwetinkhulungwane tetintfo tebuciko ethuneni laphe (The thousands of artistic treasures found in the tomb):** While important, the *discovery* of these treasures is what made him famous, not the treasures themselves.  The treasures were *found* in the untouched tomb.
* **D: Kubaluleka kwakhe ngetikhatsi taseGibhithe lasendvulo (His importance during ancient Egyptian times):** The passage indicates he wasn't particularly important during his lifetime.



"
Yini imbongi yem-Greek lengu-Homer lengakwati kukwenta?,"The correct answer is **D: Khuluma** (Speaks).

The passage states that Homer is a ""bososayensi"" (scientist) and a ""bahlabeli"" (speaker/poet). The question asks what Homer is *known* to do.  Since he is described as a poet, the best answer is that he speaks/writes.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vani** (To be/exist) - Doesn't fit the context.
* **B: Bona** (To see) - Not related to Homer's role.
* **C: Hamba** (To walk) -  Irrelevant to the passage.



"
Ngumuphi um-Greek lodvumile lowatiwa ngalokunye ngaphandle kwetincwadzi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

* The question asks for the Greek figure known for something *other* than his writings.
* Homer is known for *writing* the Iliad and Odyssey.
* Sophocles and Aristophanes are known for writing *plays*.
* Pythagoras is renowned for the **Pythagorean theorem**, a mathematical concept, not for writing.

Therefore, Pythagoras is the only option who is famous for something other than his written works.
"
Umndeni wema Hebrew usicitsa kuphi sikhatsi sawo lesiningi?,"The correct answer is **C: Egcekeni (In the synagogue)**.

The text states: ""Bafati bebapheka ebaleni; titolo betivuliwe tibuke esitaladini."" This translates to ""The fathers prayed in the synagogue; their titles were read from the scroll."" This indicates that the synagogue was a central place for the Hebrew family, where they prayed and gathered.

Therefore, the family spent a significant amount of time **in the synagogue**.
"
Yini lebeyingakabaluleki kakhulu emndenini wema Hebrew?,"The correct answer is **A: Simo sabo selitulu (Their social status)**.

The passage states: ""Endzaweni leshi, indlu bekungasiyo intfo lebaluleke kangako. Kaningi imphilo yemndeni wemaHebheru yentaka ebaleni."" This translates to ""In this dwelling, the house was not as important as the life of the family. Much of the life of the Hebrew family was in the tent.""

The passage then describes activities *within* the tent - cooking, opening the wine, and using animals for building. This implies that the *house itself* wasn't the central focus.  It wasn't about wealth or a grand dwelling; it was about the family and their life together.  Therefore, social status is the least emphasized aspect mentioned in the passage. The other options – their traditions, customs, and cooking – are all things directly linked to their daily lives within the tent.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakachazwa njengemehluko phakatsi kwemave Scandinavian?,"The correct answer is **B: Lendzawo (The place)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states differences in **people, kings, travels, and customs** between Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.  While the passage mentions the Norse sagas and Greenland, and the existence of Eskimos, it does *not* highlight geographical differences as a differentiating factor among the Scandinavian countries. The passage focuses on cultural and social differences.

Therefore, ""lendzawo"" (the place/location) is the one thing *not* mentioned as a difference.
"
Ngubani lowahlala e-Greenland kucala?,"The correct answer is **A: Tive tema-Eskimo**.

The text states: ""Noma lelo nalelo lalamave 'belingelemaScandinavia', bekunemehluko leminengi emkhatsini kwebantfu, emakhosi, imihambo nemlandvo weSweden, iNorway ne-Iceland. Kepha ngale kwetintfo latitfolile, sive sema-Eskimo besesivele siphila lapho ngaleso sikhatsi.""

This translates to: ""Although these claims 'belonged to Scandinavia', there were many differences between the people, chiefs, journeys and customs of Sweden, Norway and Iceland. But with this discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.""

Therefore, the Eskimos were already living in Greenland when the Norse arrived.
"
Nguliphi licembu lelingatsandza kudla ngaphandle kwetihlalo?,"The correct answer is **C: Emadvodza eseRoma lacebile (Wealthy Romans)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...njengoba tidla kudla kwato. Ngekwesibonelo, bebete kolo, ematamatisi, emazambane, khokho, futsi akekho umuntfu waseRoma wangesikhatsi sakadzeni lowake wanambitsa ingalukhuni.""  This means that foods like corn, tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant weren't common in ancient Rome.  The passage then says: ""Ngisho noma kudla lokunyenti kwabo sikwejwayele, emaRoma anako kudla kwawo lokungakajwayeleki..."" This implies that wealthier Romans had access to more exotic and unusual foods, including those brought from far away.

Therefore, the wealthy Romans were the ones who could afford to eat things outside of their usual diet and import exotic ingredients.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungeke kube yincenye yemkhosi wemaRoma asendvulo?,"The correct answer is **D: Sitja selikalikhuni lelosiwe (Roasted Peking Duck)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that foods like potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, and chili peppers did *not* exist in ancient Rome. Peking Duck is a Chinese dish and therefore wouldn't have been available to the Romans.

Let's look at why the other options *could* have been part of a Roman feast:

*   **A: Tivakashi letihluphekile tidla etitulwini (Exotic dishes served at the beginning of the meal):** The passage mentions exotic foods like dormice, peacocks, and piglets being eaten, suggesting exotic dishes were served at the start of a meal.
*   **B: I-appetizer yeminenke (Mini pig appetizer):** The passage mentions piglets being eaten, so a mini pig appetizer is plausible.
*   **C: Emadvodza lacebile alala phasi ngesikhatsi sesidlo santsambama (Rich men lying down to eat during dinner):** The passage talks about the Romans reclining while they ate.

Therefore, Peking Duck is the only option that definitively wouldn't have been part of a Roman feast."
"Ngalokusekelwe endzimeni, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungenteka kube nemtselela lohlala njalo?","The correct answer is **A: Umphakatsi (Umphakatsi)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the development of a large community of people living and working together in a place. This inherently describes the formation of a **umphakatsi** (village/community), which is the natural outcome of people gathering and working together.  The text lays the groundwork for this by discussing the origins of cities from smaller settlements.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lisiko lelincane (Small culture):** The passage talks about *the* large culture evolving, not a small one.
* **C: Sifundza lesitimele (We study history):**  While history is relevant, the passage focuses on the development of the community itself, not the act of studying history.
* **D: Lisiko lemphucuko (Culture of development):** The passage *describes* development, but it doesn't identify ""a culture of development"" as the next logical step.  Development is a *process* that leads to a community.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, yini leyandvulela sive?","The correct answer is **A: Lisiko lemphucuko (Civilization)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Imphucuko ilisiko lelikhulu lebantfu labahlala futsi basebente ndzawonye endzaweni letsite."" (Civilization is a large culture of people who live and work together in a city.)

While the passage discusses elements *within* civilization (like Latin *civilis* meaning city/citizen, and the evolution of customs), the core concept being defined and discussed is civilization itself. Therefore, the question asking what the passage is about directly points to civilization as the central theme.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Lisiko lelilodvwa (A single culture):** The passage emphasizes the *large* and interconnected nature of civilization, not a single, isolated culture.
* **C: Sifundza lesitimele (We study history):** While the passage mentions historical evolution, it's not primarily *about* studying history. It's about defining civilization.
* **D: Emasiko lamancane (Small cultures):**  The passage defines civilization in contrast to smaller, more localized cultures.
"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesingasilo liciniso mayelana ne-Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **C: Umlilo umoshe tinsalela letiningi tale-Castle**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that a fire in 1951 *left only remnants* of Drukgyal Dzong, specifically the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel. Option C accurately reflects this information.
* Options A, B, and D are supported by the passage:
    * **A: Yakhelwe kugubha kuncoba kwemabutfo aseTibetan-Mongol** - The passage mentions Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel building the fortress to defend against them.
    * **B: Itfolakala eBhuthan** - The passage explicitly states Drukgyal Dzong is one of Bhutan's most famous landmarks.
    * **D: Yadalwa ngu Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - The passage states that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress.



Therefore, the statement that is *not* true based on the passage is **C**."
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesichaza ngalokungiko umphumela wemlilo Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Intfo lesele bekumfanekiso waZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel**.

The passage states: ""Ngemuva kwalomlilo, lencaba lenkhulu leyakhiwe yagcinwa futsi yavikelwa, yasala yaba ngulenye yetintfo letikhangako ta-Bhutan. **Intfo lesele bekumfanekiso waZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.**"" (After the fire, the large fortress was preserved and protected, and remained one of the most iconic things of Bhutan. **Only the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel remained.**)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Emabutho aTibetan-Mongol ancobile** - The passage mentions the threat of Tibetan-Mongol armies but doesn't say they were victorious.
*   **C: Kutsandvwa lokukhangako akumange kutsintseke** - The passage clearly states that something *was* destroyed (the fortress).
*   **D: Yalondvolotwa nguZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - The passage indicates that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress, but it doesn't mention him destroying it.
"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesilandzelako lesiliciniso mayelana ne-Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Cambodia yahlaselwa i-Vietnam ekucaleni kwemakhulu langu-18 eminyaka.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Kuleminyaka yekugcina yelikhulu lesi-18 iVietname nayo yangena eCambodia."" (In the late 18th century, Vietnam also entered Cambodia.)
* It also states: ""Base-Thai bangena eCambodia tikhatsi letinyenti ngelikhulu lesi-18 futsi nga-1772 babhubhisa iPhnom Phen."" (The Thais entered Cambodia at that time and burned Phnom Phen in 1772.)

Option C accurately reflects that Vietnam entered Cambodia in the late 18th century, leading to conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: EmaVietnames abhubhise Phnom Phen:**  The text states the Thais burned Phnom Phen, not the Vietnamese.
* **B: I-Cambodia ihlasele iThailand ngo 1772:** The text states the Thais attacked Cambodia in 1772, not the other way around.
* **D: Bantfu baseThailand babhubhise iPhnom Phen:** While the Thais *did* burn Phnom Phen, the question asks for the *next* true statement about Cambodia, and option C is a more encompassing and accurate statement based on the provided text. It highlights the broader conflict involving Vietnam as well.



"
Ngutiphi titatmende letilandzelako letichaza ngalokungiko kuhlaselwa kwe-Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **B: Bantfu baseThailand kanye kanye baseVietnam bahlasele iCambodia ngo 1772**.

Here's why:

* The provided text states: ""Base-Thai bangena eCambodia tikhatsi letinyenti ngelikhulu lesi-18 futsi nga-1772 babhubhisa iPhnom Phen. Kuleminyaka yekugcina yelikhulu lesi-18 iVietname nayo yangena eCambodia."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I-Vietnam ihlasele iCambodia kaningi** - The text only mentions Vietnam's involvement in the late 18th century, not that they attacked Cambodia *often*.
* **C: EmaVietnames abhubhise Phnom Phen** - The text states that *Thais* blew up Phnom Phen in 1772.
* **D: Bantfu baseThailand bahlasele iCambodia kaningi** -  The text only mentions one instance of a Thai attack, not that they attacked Cambodia *often*.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lengakakhoni kukwenta ngesikhatsi ise-Taiwan I-Dutch East India Company?,"The correct answer is **B: Kutijwayeta kukhicita lokusanhlavu kwemdzabu (Introduce sugar cane cultivation)**.

The passage states: "" Nga-1624, Inkapane yaseNdiya iDutch East, icalisa sisekelo eningizimu-nshonalanga neTaiwan, lapho yacalisa lushintjo lendlela yekukhicita lokusanhlavu kwemdzabu futsi yacasha tisebenti taseShayina kusebenta emasimini ayo erayisi newashukela.""  This directly indicates the Dutch East India Company introduced sugar cane cultivation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Banesizindza encenyeni leseningizimu-ntshonalanga yesichingi (Possess a naval base in the southern part of the island)** - The passage mentions establishing a base, but doesn't explicitly state it was a *naval* base.
* **C: Casha tisebenti taseChina emasimini ayo (Hire Chinese laborers in its fields)** - While the Dutch did hire laborers, the passage states they *also* started Chinese laborers working in *rice* fields. The key action they introduced was sugar cane cultivation.
* **D: Ngekutimisela kuyekela kulawula iTaiwan ebukhosini baka-Qing (Transfer to allow control of Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty)** - The passage states Taiwan was eventually transferred to the *Japanese* Dynasty, not the Qing Dynasty.



"
Yini leyasungulwa sivumelwano sase-Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **D: Ligunya lase-Japan ngetulu kwe-Taiwan**.

The passage states: ""Ngama-1895, emva kwekuhlulwa emphini yekucala yeSino neJapane(1894-1895), lohulumende weQing wasayina Sivumelwano saseShimonoseki, lapho wavuma kushiyela iTaiwan kutsi ibengiyo lebusa ngetulu kweJapan..."" This directly indicates that the agreement granted Japan control over Taiwan.
"
Likalwa njani lizinga lekhemikhali I-pH?,"The correct answer is **C: Linani lema-ions Hydrogen kukhemikhali.**

Here's why:

* **pH is defined as a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution.** The more hydrogen ions present, the more acidic the solution. The fewer hydrogen ions, the more alkaline (basic) the solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ikhemikhali isisekelo noma iyi-acid ngakanani:** While acidity and alkalinity are related to pH, the question asks *how* pH is measured, not what acidity/alkalinity *is*.
* **B: Mangaki ema-Proton kukhemikhali:**  Protons are hydrogen nuclei (a single proton). While related, pH specifically measures the *concentration* of hydrogen *ions* (H+), not just the total number of protons.
* **D: Mangaki ema-electrons lakukhemikhali:**  Electrons are involved in chemical bonding, but pH is specifically about hydrogen ions.



"
Yini leyasuswa kuma-ions Hydrogen?,"The correct answer is **A: Ema-proton**.

Here's why:

The question states that hydrogen ions (H+) are protons that have lost their electrons.  Therefore, the missing component is protons.

Let's break down the other options:

* **B: I-pH:** pH is a measure *of* the concentration of hydrogen ions, not what is removed *from* them.
* **C: I-Alkaline:** Alkaline (or basic) substances are the *opposite* of acidic and have a higher pH.
* **D: Ema-Electron:**  Hydrogen ions *lose* electrons, they are not removed *from* them.



"
Ngutiphi kuletinkhulumo letilandzelako letingakuchazi kahle kutidla kwemabhubesi?,"The correct answer is **B: Silinganiso salomdvuna nawesifazane asilingani.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Lamabhubesi lamasikati anebudlelwane lobusedvute kulomunye nalomunye, aba ngumndeni lomkhulu lowakhiwa bosisi nemadvodzakati."" (These lion cubs have a strong bond with each other, forming a family unit consisting of sisters and male cubs.) This directly contradicts the idea of an unequal relationship between males and females.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **A: Titiphatsa ngendlela lefana nemaphaketi etinja:** The text explicitly states, ""Licembu lemabhubesi lenta njengelicembu letimphisi, noma tinja, tilwane leticishe tifane nemabhubesi (kodvwa hhayi emakati lamakhulu) ngekutiphatsa..."" (The lion cub family is like a pack of animals, an animal that resembles lions (but not adult ones) in behavior...)
* **C: Labadvuna nabesifazane bonkhe bahlobene dvute:** The text says, ""...aba ngumndeni lomkhulu lowakhiwa bosisi nemadvodzakati."" (...forming a family unit consisting of sisters and male cubs.) This implies a close family relationship between all members.
* **D: Totibili tiyabulala futsi tiyahlalisana:**  The text states, ""...kantsi futsi tiyabulala uma titingela."" (...and they kill if threatened.)  This indicates they are capable of aggression and defense.



Therefore, option B is the only statement that is *not* accurately described by the provided text.
"
Ngutiphi tinkhulumo kuleti letilandzelako letingakuchazi kahle kutiphatsa kwemabhubesi?,"The correct answer is **D: Kutiphatsa kwawo kuyafana nalamanye emakati lamakhulu (Their behavior is the same as other big cats)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Lamabhubesi lamasikati anebudlelwane lobusedvute kulomunye nalomunye, aba ngumndeni lomkhulu lowakhiwa bosisi nemadvodzakati. Licembu lemabhubesi lenta njengelicembu letimphisi, noma tinja, tilwane leticishe tifane nemabhubesi (kodvwa hhayi emakati lamakhulu) ngekutiphatsa...""  This means their behavior is *similar to* other big cats, but *not the same*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Abantfu kakhulu emphakatsini (People are very crowded in the middle):**  This is not mentioned or implied in the text.
* **B: Indlela latiphatsa nagyo iyefana neyetimphisi (The way they behave is the same as birds):** The text states they are *not* the same as birds; they are compared to cats and dogs.
* **C: Kokubili lamadvuna nawesifazane kuyingoti kakhulu etilwaneni (Both the male and female are very strong in fights):** The text describes a family structure but doesn't directly compare fighting strength between males and females. It mentions they fight for territory.



Therefore, option D is the one that *doesn't* accurately describe the behavior of lions according to the text."
Bonogwaja basisulu lesivamile saluphi luhlobo letilwane letiyingelako?,"The correct answer is **A: Likati lelincane (Small cat)**.

The text states: ""Ngephansi kwato kunaletiningi tinhlobo letisemkhatsini ngekwakheka tabokati letidla tinyamatane letisemkhatsini ngekwakheka kusukela kubologwaja, kuye kumashongololo kanye nema-deer."" (Below the top are intermediate types with the structure of meat-eating animals with a structure ranging from genet, to hyrax and deer.)  Then it goes on to describe small cats that eat small animals. Therefore, genets (bologwaja) are small cats.
"
Emakati lamancane ngalokuvamile atingela kuphi kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **C: Tinyamatane (Small animals)**.

The text states: ""Imakati lamanyenti lamancane (lokufaka ekhatsi emakati lafuywako latihambelako) ladla tilwane letincane njengetilokatana, emagundvwane, imigololo, netinyoni."" This translates to: ""Small wild cats (which are between the wildcat and the lynx) eat small animals such as shrews, hares, mice, and birds.""

Therefore, small wild cats typically prey on small animals.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo incenye yendlela yekutingela ema-ocelot?,"The correct answer is **D: Kutingela kuphela tilwane letinesayizi lencane (Only hunting small animals)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that ocelots eat a variety of animals, including cats, snakes, rodents, and birds. It *doesn't* say they *only* eat small animals. 
* Options A, B, and C are all explicitly mentioned as part of the ocelot hunting process in the text.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that isn't supported by the provided information.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungachazi kahle i-ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **B: Tinyakata ngalokuthulile** (They are quiet).

Here's why:

* The text states that ocelots are *yanyenya* (stealthy) and have excellent night vision.  This implies they are *not* quiet.
* The other options are all things the text *does* say about ocelots:
    * **A: Tikhona kutingela kahle ebusuku** (They hunt well at night) - The text explicitly states this.
    * **C: Imiva yato yekunuka ibutsakatsaka** (Their sense of smell is keen) - The text explains they use scent to track prey.
    * **D: Tikhetsa kutingela tilwane letincane** (They choose to hunt small animals) - The text states they eat small animals.



Therefore, the answer that doesn't align with the text is that ocelots are quiet. They are stealthy, not quiet."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungeke kubukwe njengemandla lamakhulu engwe?,"The answer is **B: Kunwabhela**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the leopard is known for its ability to *be stealthy, stalk, bask in the sun, and pounce with powerful leaps*. It also emphasizes that leopards *cannot roar* like lions, tigers, and jaguars. Therefore, ""kunwabhela"" (to roar) is the action that the leopard *cannot* do, and thus would not be considered a display of its powerful strengths.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngumuphi umehluko phakatsi kwetingwe nemabhubesi?","The correct answer is **A: Lukhono lato lekubhukuta (Its ability to climb).**

The passage states that leopards are unique among the Panthera genus (which includes lions, tigers, and jaguars) because they can climb trees and are skilled at it. The passage explicitly mentions this climbing ability as a distinguishing characteristic. The other options (weight of pounce, ear size, and strength of pounce) are not discussed in the text as differentiating factors between leopards and lions.
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, Robert Hooke wentani ngaphambi kwaletinye tati tetintfo letiphilako?","The correct answer is **C: Caphela tikwele letincane**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Robert Hooke, losati setintfo letiphilako waseNgilandi, wabona tikwele letincane entfweni leyakhiwe ngesigodvo yekuvala emabhodlela asebentisa sibonakudze. Bekabukeka njengemakamelo.""

This means he observed the tiny boxes (cells) first.
"
Shano kutsi imvelaphi yeligama lelitsi “cell” isho kutsini?,"The correct answer is **B: Likamelo lelincane**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ingcamuza ligama lesitsatselwa kwelesiLathini lelitsi **cella** lelisho likamelo lelincane."" (The word ""cell"" comes from the Latin word ""cella"" which means a small room.)
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, tilwane letiningi tinelukhono lekwentani?","The correct answer is **A: Phapha** (Float).

The text states: ""Tilwane letinyenti tiyakhona kuhamba. Tilwane kuphela letinetingcondvo (nomanje kungasito tonkhe tilwane letinayo; ijellyfish, ngekwesibonelo, ite ingcondvo). Tilwane titfolakala emhlabeni wonkhe. Tiyagubha emhlabatsini, tibhukushe etilwandle, futsi tindize esibhakabhakeni.""

This translates to: ""Jellyfish can move. Only jellyfish (or now all jellyfish; jellyfish, for example, is a jellyfish). Jellyfish are found all over the world. They swim in the ocean, float in the water, and fly in the sky.""

The ability to float is a key characteristic of jellyfish. The other options are not directly mentioned as a primary characteristic related to their movement or structure.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngutiphi tilwane letingena?","The correct answer is **B: Lukhono lekugaya (The ability to change shape)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tilwane letinyenti tiyakhona kuhamba."" (Jellyfish can move).  It also defines jellyfish as one type of invertebrate.  A key characteristic of invertebrates (and jellyfish specifically) is their ability to change shape. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ema-cell (In cells):** While jellyfish *are* made of cells, the ability to change shape isn't solely defined by cell structure.
* **C: Bucopho (Strength):** Strength isn't the defining characteristic of jellyfish.
* **D: Lukhono lekudla (The ability to eat):**  All animals, including jellyfish, eat. This isn't unique to jellyfish or invertebrates.



"
Yini lesita titjalo enchubeni ye-photosynthesis?,"The correct answer is **D: Lilanga**.

The passage states: ""Tihlahla tenta kudla kwato ngekusitwa lilanga ngenchubo lebitwa ngekutsi yi-photoynthesis."" This translates to ""Plants make their food by eating the sun through a process called photosynthesis.""

Therefore, the sun is the energy source for photosynthesis.
"
Yini lena bantfu labayikhiphako ihogelwe tigjalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Umoya lohlantekile (Clean air)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that plants ""tihlahla tikhicita umoya mphilo lophefumulwa bantfu...tona titsatse umoya lophuma ebantfwini lobitwa ngekutsi yi-carbon-dioxide (lokhishwa bantfu)."" This means plants take in carbon dioxide (what humans exhale) and release oxygen.  Oxygen is essential for human life and is what we breathe. Therefore, plants provide us with clean air.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngisiphi kuletibonelo letilandzelako lesingatsiya inchubo yekutiphendvukela kwemvelo?","The correct answer is **A: Licembi lelincane lelihlulekako kuchuma endzaweni lesha.**

Here's why:

The passage defines speciation as the formation of new types (species). It uses the example of a small group of animals becoming isolated and adapting to a new location, eventually diverging from the original population. Option A directly reflects this scenario: a small group of animals becoming isolated and adapting to a new location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Incenye yemuntfu munye lotfutsela endzaweni lesha:** This describes an individual adapting to a new environment, not the formation of a new species.
*   **C: Sibalo sebatfu lesilungisa kutayela kwayo endzaweni lesha:** This describes a population adapting to a new environment, but doesn't necessarily imply the formation of a new species.
*   **D: Sibalo sinye sigcine senta lababili:** This doesn't align with the passage's description of speciation, which involves divergence and the formation of new types.



"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesilandzelako lesingachazi kahle inchubo ye-speciation? ,"The correct answer is **C: Kubukiselwa ekwakhiweni kweluhlobo lolusha** (It prevents the formation of a new species).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that speciation *is* the formation of new species.**  Option C directly contradicts this.
* **Options A, B, and D are all accurate statements based on the passage:**
    * **A:** The passage says the new population needs to adapt to new conditions and therefore needs to change its traits.
    * **B:** The passage clearly states speciation is a crucial part of evolution.
    * **D:** The passage says speciation is an unavoidable process.



Therefore, option C is the only statement that incorrectly describes speciation according to the passage."
Nguyiphi incenye yesimiso sekujikeleta kwengati leletsa ingati enhlitiyweni?,"The correct answer is **A: Imitsambo yengati (Blood vessels)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that arteries carry blood *away* from the heart and veins carry blood *back* to the heart. Both arteries and veins are types of blood vessels.
* Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels and are where the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste occurs. They don't carry blood directly back to the heart.
* Titfo temtimba (muscle fibers) and timba (tissue) are not directly involved in the circulatory system's transportation of blood.

Therefore, ""Imitsambo yengati"" (blood vessels) is the most accurate and encompassing answer.
"
Nguwaphi emashubhu lamancane kakhulu ehlelweni lekujikeleta kwengati?,"The correct answer is **A: Ema-Capillary**.

The passage states: ""Imitsambo yengati lemincane ibitwa ngekutsi ema-capillaries."" This translates to ""The larger blood vessels are called capillaries.""
"
Lukhono letinambutane lekugoba emaphiko ayo emuva ikhulisa ngukuphi lokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **B: Indzawo yekubhaca (The place to catch)**.

The passage states: ""Loku kubaniketa indzawo levulekile lenetindzawana letincane tekubhacela bahlaseli."" which translates to ""This clinging requires an open place with small places to catch predators.""  This refers to the placement of their legs for catching prey.
"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakashiwo endzimeni njengetfo likhono lekuphapha kwetinambutane?,"The correct answer is **C: Kugcogca kudla (Eating food)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how dragonflies and mayflies are able to catch prey due to their ability to cling to plants. The passage mentions that this allows them to ambush prey, eat, and rest.  While the other options might be true for insects in general, the passage *specifically* highlights the ability to *eat food* as a direct benefit of clinging to plants and being able to ambush prey. Therefore, it's the most closely related and directly supported answer.
"
Nguyiphi tici letilandzelako letingakavami kusebentiswa nema-dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **D: Tinyawo letinetinzipho (Claws)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes dinosaurs as having claws, being bipedal (walking on two legs), and having a tail.  Of the options provided:

*   **A: Kuhamba ngemlente lomnyama (Walking on two legs)** - While many dinosaurs *did* walk on two legs, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as unusual. It's a common characteristic mentioned.
*   **B: Tinsiba (Scales)** -  The passage mentions scales, but it's not presented as unusual.
*   **C: Kubeka emacandza (Having a tail)** - The passage mentions a tail, but doesn't say it's unusual.
*   **D: Tinyawo letinetinzipho (Claws)** - The passage *specifically* mentions claws as a feature that makes dinosaurs seem unusual to some people, because they are also found in birds.

Therefore, claws are the most unusual feature among the options provided, based on the information in the passage."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakavami kubukwa njengesici lesabiwe setinyoni nema-dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **B: Kusebentisa tinyawo letimbili tasemuva kuhamba**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""tihamba ngetinyawo tato tangemuva njenge-T-Rex."" This means walking on two back legs is a characteristic *similar* to dinosaurs (like the T-Rex), making it an unusual feature that might lead someone to initially mistake a bird for a dinosaur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kubeka macandza:** Many animals besides dinosaurs and birds can place their feet. It's not unique to dinosaurs.
* **C: Likhono lekundiza:**  The passage mentions that people *don't* think birds are dinosaurs *because* they can fly.  Flight is a key difference.
* **D: Tinyawo ngetindzipho:** While birds have feet, the passage highlights the *two back legs* walking pattern as the key similarity to dinosaurs.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi incenye yesitjalo se-cycad lokungenteka idle i-Triceratops?","The correct answer is **A: Emacembe enaso (The fronds)**.

The passage states: ""Letitjalo betibukeka njengesihlahla lesincane selusundvu tinemchele locijile, nemacembe lahlabako."" (The plants looked like a small palm tree with a thick trunk and spiky fronds). This indicates the fronds were the part of the cycad that Triceratops likely ate.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungenteka kutsi i-Triceratops idle? ","The text states that some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, which are described as looking like a small palm tree with coiled fronds. The text then discusses a debate about whether cycads were a common food source for dinosaurs. It mentions that some animals today, like sloths and anteaters, eat fruits and cycads.

Considering this, the best answer is **B: Sitselo lesinemagaja lacinile (Cycad seeds)**. 

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions cycads as a potential food source.**
* **Cycad seeds are a part of the cycad plant.**
* **The text implies the debate revolves around whether cycads were a *common* food source, making the specific part of the plant (seeds) a relevant detail.**

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

* **A: Libheja (Leaves)** - While Triceratops *might* have eaten leaves, the text focuses on cycads.
* **C: Lipoli (Fruits)** - The text only mentions that some animals eat fruits, not that Triceratops specifically ate them.
* **D: Sitjalo lesinetitselo letinebutsi (Plants with fleshy fruits)** - Again, this isn't mentioned in connection with Triceratops.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kulemidlalo lelandzelako lekungenteka idume kakhulu etindzaweni letisenyakatho ye-Italy?","The correct answer is **A: Ibhola yetinyawo (Football)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Italian national team in football (soccer) achieved global success and won the 2006 World Cup. Football is the most popular sport in Italy by a significant margin. While other sports are played, football has the widest appeal and is the most widely followed.

Therefore, considering popularity and impact in Northern Italy, football is the most likely answer.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini loluniketwe endzimeni, ngumuphi kulemidlalo lelandzelako lowawina umcudzelwano wemhlaba wase-Italy?","The answer is **A: Ibhola yetinyawo (Football)**.

The text states that the Italian team won the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Football is another name for soccer, which is known as ""libhola letinyawo"" in the provided text.
"
Ngemuva kwasiphi sentakalo tincenye letitsite tase-Luxembourg taba I Belgium?,"The correct answer is **B: Kugucuka Kwebantfu Base-Belgiam (The Belgian Revolution)**.

The text states: ""Tincenye tamanje teBelgium betiyincenye yeLuxembourg esikhatsini lesendlulile kodvwa tabese tiba yiBelgian ngemuva kwa-1830 ngemuva Kwetingucuko taseBelgian."" This translates to ""Parts of present-day Belgium were once part of Luxembourg but became Belgian after 1830 following the Belgian Revolution.""

Therefore, the Belgian Revolution (or the movement for Belgian independence) led to those parts of Luxembourg becoming part of Belgium.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokutsintse kungatsatsi luhlangotsi kwe-Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **B: Kujoyina Inyonyana Yase-Europe**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngukuva-1957 iLuxembourg yaba ngumsunguli walenhlangano leyatiwa ngekutsi Inhlangano yaseYurophu namuhla."" (In 1957, Luxembourg became a founder of the organization now called the European Union.)

This directly indicates that joining the European Union was a significant later development in Luxembourg's history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umsebenti wase-German** (German occupation): While Germany occupied Luxembourg during both World Wars, the text describes Luxembourg as being *under* German rule, not becoming German territory.
*   **C: Kugucuka Kwebantfu Base-Belgiam** (Becoming part of Belgium): The text mentions Luxembourg being part of Belgium in the past, but it also says it became independent in 1839.
*   **D: Kuba live lelitimele** (Becoming independent): The text states that Luxembourg gained independence in 1839, so this happened *before* joining the European Union.



"
Mangaki emakhilomitha Sikwele endzawo yonkhe yase-Turkey e-Europe?,"The correct answer is **D: 23,764**.

The text states: ""Indzawo yaseTurkey, kufaka ekhatsi emachibi, ivala 783,562 wema-square khilomitha (300,948 sq mi), ema-square khilomitha langu 755,688 (291,773 sq mi) angaseningizimu nenshonalanga ye-Asia bese nema-square khilomitha langu-23,764 (9,174 sq mi) eYuropha.""

This means that the area of Turkey in Europe is 23,764 square kilometers.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, cishe imakhilomitha lamangaki i-Turkey?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The passage states: ""Indzawo yaseTurkey ingetulu ngemakhilomitha langu-1,600 (1,000 mi) budze futsi ibe ngu-800 km (500 mi) bubanti..."" which translates to ""The area of Turkey is approximately 1,600 kilometers in length and 800 km wide...""
"
Lusetjentiswela ini lulwimi lwesi-Latini e-Vetican City?,"The correct answer is **A: Imicimbi yenkholo (Religious events)**.

The text states: ""siLatin sivame kusetjentiswa emibutsanweni yetenkholo"" which translates to ""Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.""
"
"Edolobheni lase-Vatican, indzaba si-Italian singasebentiswa sona?","The correct answer is **A: Umtsetfo (Law)**.

The text states: ""I-Vatican City isebentisa Sitaliyane emitsetfweni kanye..."".  This directly indicates that Italian is used in the legal system of Vatican City. While it's also used in diplomatic communications and by those working there, the primary use mentioned in the context of the city's functioning is law.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umculo utfebulwa kusetjentiswa bongcondvomshini labayinkimbinkimbi kwenta nekuhlanganisa imisindvo kanyekanye.""  This translates to ""Music is created using complex synthesizers to create and combine sounds.""

The passage directly links the use of complex synthesizers (which are used for sound) to the creation of music. The other options (images, videos, and creation) are mentioned as things that computers *display* or *produce*, but the passage specifically focuses on the *creation* of music using synthesizers.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, miningi lemiti lekuyiphi indzawo lenemathoyilethi lashaywako?","The correct answer is **A: I-Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Emadolobheni aseHarapa neMohenjo-daro anemitindlu tangasese lehambisa indle ngemanti cishe kuto tonkhe tindlu..."" which translates to ""In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, there were bathrooms connected to the houses with drains almost to every house...""

While the passage mentions toilets in other locations, it's the only one specifically described as having widespread plumbing connected to houses.
"
Kukutiphi tindzawo kuleti letilandzelako lapho kutholwe khona emasistimu endle atfutfukile?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Harappa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Emadolobheni aseHarappa neMohenjo-daro anemitindlu tangasese lehambisa indle ngemanti cishe kuto tonkhe tindlu..."" (In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, there were sophisticated drainage systems that carried water almost to every house...).

While other locations mentioned (Santorini, Egypt, China) *also* had drainage systems, the passage directly links sophisticated drainage to Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.  The question asks where *else* such systems were found, making Harappa the most direct answer based on the text.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokubangela kutsi loshwibako ajike?,"The correct answer is **A: Lijika lelincane ngaphasi kwensingo yesketi** (It turns slightly underneath the skirt).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...njengoba lolusingo lutjekile kancane, njengoba lolungucuka kusuka kulolunye luhlangotsi kuya kulololunye, lesiphetfo sawo lesitsintsa lelichwa naso siyagobeka. Loku kubangela kutsi lamasodvo ahambe."" ( ...because the lens is slightly slanted, as it moves from one side to the other, and the connecting piece also rubs against the fabric, causing the beads to move.)
* **The beads are moving because of the slight slant of the lens underneath the skirt.** This slight shift causes the beads to shift and therefore, the entire structure (the skirt) to rotate.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Iminyaka lemibile eduzane nensingo yesketi** (The years close to the skirt) - This is irrelevant to the mechanics of the skirt's rotation.
* **C: Lonkhe lizinga lelikhono lemgibeli wesketi** (The entire skill level of the skirt's movement) - While movement skills exist, the passage specifically points to a physical, mechanical reason (the slanted lens) for the rotation.
* **D: Lizinga le-ayisi** (The ice level) -  Ice has no bearing on the rotation of a skirt's lens.



Therefore, **A** is the only answer that directly addresses the cause of the skirt's rotation based on the information provided in the passage.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuchaza ngalokungiko imbobo yensimbi yesimanje yekushibilika esithwathweni?","The correct answer is **B: Kugobekile (Worn/Eroded)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the lens's edge is slightly worn/eroded due to the movement between the two lens elements. This wear and tear is causing the screws to loosen, and consequently, the movement of the lenses.  Therefore, the material at the point of contact is being ""gobekile"" (worn/eroded).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lokukabili (Second):** This refers to a position and isn't related to the material condition.
*   **C: Umgede (Bent/Dented):** While potential, the passage doesn't describe the metal being bent or dented. It specifically mentions wear and tear.
*   **D: Kutjekile (Tightened):** The passage states the screws are loosening, indicating the opposite of tightened.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi inchubo levumela ema-athomu kutsi asuse emandla langetulu kwemandla ekukhanya?","The correct answer is **D: Kukhishwa kwemisebe levuselelwe (Spontaneous Emission)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Bososayensi babita lenchubo ngekutsi """"kuphuma lokukhutsatako kwemisebe"""" ngoba lama-atom akhishwa ngulokukhanya, bese sekabangela kutsi kuphume lemisebe yekukhanya."" This directly translates to ""Scientists call this process ""spontaneous emission"" because the atoms are emitted into light, and then cause light to be emitted.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imisebe (Emission):** While emission is part of the process, it's not the *specific name* for the mechanism described.
* **B: Kukhishwa kwema-photon lavuselewe (Stimulated Emission):**  The passage describes *spontaneous* emission, not stimulated emission. Stimulated emission requires an incoming photon to trigger the release of another photon.
* **C: I-Photon (Photon):** A photon is a particle of light, but it doesn't explain *how* the atom loses energy. The process of emitting a photon *is* spontaneous emission.



"
Yini leyenta i-atom ikhiphe i-photon?,"The correct answer is **C: Emazinga emandla langakazinzi**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Kuze abuyele akhanye ngelizinga lebekakhanya ngalo ngaphambili kufanele alahle emandla lengetiwe lawatfole kulokukhanya.""  This means atoms need to release energy to return to a lower energy state.
* The text explains this release occurs through the emission of photons.
* The passage explicitly states: ""Bososayensi babita lenchubo ngekutsi """"kuphuma lokukhutsatako kwemisebe"""" ngoba lama-atom akhishwa ngulokukhanya, bese sekabangela kutsi kuphume lemisebe yekukhanya.""  This refers to the release of energy in the form of light.
* Atoms only emit energy (and therefore photons) when they are in an excited state – meaning they have absorbed energy and are at a higher energy level.  They release this energy when they return to a lower, more stable energy level.  **Excited states are inherently unstable**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kukhulula emandla lamaningi:** While energy *is* released, the specific reason *why* the atom releases it is being returning to a more stable energy state, not just ""releasing a lot of energy"".
* **B: Kuvuselela lokubangwa kukhanya lokukhulu:** The process isn't about amplifying light; it's about releasing the energy that was absorbed to reach a higher state.
* **D: Kusabela lokungasikuhle emisebeni:**  The passage doesn't indicate that the process is a reaction to something ""bad"" happening; it's a fundamental physical process of energy release.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini letawugcina ibanga kutsi sibani siyekele kusebenta?","The correct answer is **B: Kuba nesisekelo sensimbi yesibani kuphela kancane kusokhethi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the lamp has been broken for a long time and is no longer working. Replacing the bulb requires working with the electrical connections. If the lamp's metal base isn't properly grounded to the socket, it can cause a problem that prevents the lamp from working. The grounding provides a path for electricity to flow safely. If the metal base only makes minimal contact with the socket, the electrical connection will be poor, and the lamp won't function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sibani asikacinywa ngendlela lekahle (The lamp is not switched off properly):**  While important for safety, turning off the switch isn't the root cause of the lamp failing after a long time.
* **C: Mucu lophakatsi kwesibani uyasha (The lamp's plastic housing is damaged):** Plastic housing damage could be a problem, but the passage focuses on the metal connection to the socket.
* **D: Kugeleta kwagezi kuya kusokhethi kuyancipha (The electrical leakage to the socket is decreasing):** The passage indicates a *lack* of proper connection, not decreasing leakage.

Therefore, the most logical explanation is that the lamp's metal base has insufficient contact with the socket, which is preventing it from working.
"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungaba yingoti kukutsintsa uma ushintja sibani?,"The correct answer is **D: Ikhebuli (Cable)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kwekucala, iswishi yalelambu kufanele icishwe noma intsambo ikhishwe."" (First, the light switch must be turned off or the wire must be removed.)

After turning off the power or removing the wire, the next step is to disconnect the **cable** that connects the light fixture to the electrical system.  The other options aren't the immediate next step in the process.



"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, kwentekani uma i-nucleus ihlukana?","The correct answer is **B: Emandla ayakhululwa (Energy is released)**.

Here's why:

* **Fission** is the process of splitting a heavy nucleus into two smaller nuclei.  This process *releases a tremendous amount of energy*. This is the core principle behind nuclear power and atomic bombs.
* **A:** While protons *can* be released, the primary and most significant result of fission is energy release.
* **C:** The resulting atoms *do* become unstable (radioactive). However, the *immediate* consequence of the nucleus splitting is the release of energy.
* **D:** Neutrons *are* released during fission, but the main outcome is energy release.

Therefore, the most accurate and direct consequence of a nucleus splitting during fission is the release of energy."
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokukhombisa libanga lelidze kushayela emuva emhlabeni,"The correct answer is **A: Tibonakudze (Observations)**.

The passage states: ""Bososayensi basebentisa sibonakudze ngoba kukhanya kwemhlaba kwenta kutsi kungabonakali kahle."" This translates to ""Scientists used observations because the Earth's light made it easier to see.""

Therefore, the next step is to **observe** the landing of the satellite. The other options are incorrect because the passage already discusses satellites and rockets, and the focus is on the observation of the landing."
Ngikuphi kuleti letisebentiselwa kubeka sibonakudze emkhatsini?,"The correct answer is **B: Emarokhethi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Lesethelayithi yatfunyelwa emkhatsini nge-rocket."" (The satellite was launched into space by a rocket.)

Therefore, the satellite is placed *on* a rocket to reach the necessary altitude.
"
Lokufanele kucaphelwe ngemcimbi lojikeletako kute kulandzelwe kuhamba kwesikhatsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Budze besikhatsi (The question of time)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes how we *understand* and *conceptualize* time. It talks about how time has been studied in various disciplines (religion, philosophy, science) and how we perceive it as a cycle. The passage is fundamentally about the *question of what time is and how we relate to it.*

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ludumo (Fame/Glory):**  While time might be related to accomplishments that lead to fame, the passage doesn't focus on fame itself.
* **C: Tsintsa (Connection/Bond):** The passage doesn't primarily discuss the connections between people or things.
* **D: Lukhuni (Longing/Yearning):**  While people might experience longing related to time (e.g., longing for the past), the core theme is more about understanding the nature of time itself.



Therefore, **Budze besikhatsi (The question of time)** best captures the central idea of the passage."
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, ngusiphi sici sesigameko lesisebentiswa sikhatsi kucatsanisa?","The correct answer is **A: Budze (Knowledge)**.

The passage states: ""Sikhatsi futsi siyindlela lesicatsanisa ngayo budze betehlakalo."" This translates to ""Time and space are a way to relate to intellectual knowledge.""  Therefore, the passage explicitly connects time and space to knowledge.
"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokubukwa njengalokutayelekile njengendlalifa yesihlalo sebukhosi?","The correct answer is **C: Kufundza Umlandvo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Charles's decision to study Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History (achieving a 2:2 degree), was *unconventional* for a future monarch. The question asks what was considered unusual. While all the options are mentioned, the fact that he pursued a degree, *especially* in History, is the key point of departure from the norm for a royal heir who would typically be groomed for a military career.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kutfola i-2:2 libanga:** While the 2:2 is mentioned as unusual, it's the *pursuit* of a degree at all, and History specifically, that's the more significant deviation from tradition.
*   **B: Kuyekela inyuvesi kute ujoyine emasotja:** This is the traditional path and therefore *not* unconventional.
*   **D: Kuya enyuvesi ngaphambi kwekujoyina emasotja:** This is also a more standard progression than Charles's specific academic choices.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini loluniketwe indzimeni, Charles waba wekucala kwentani?","The correct answer is **C: Kutfola ticu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Charles bekalilungu lekucala Lomndeni Wasebukhosini WaseBritish lowaklomeliswa ngesicu se-degree."" This directly translates to ""Charles was the first royal family member of British descent to be awarded a degree.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kujiyina emasotja ngaphambi kwekucedza sikolo (Joining the army before going to school):** The passage explicitly says he studied at Trinity College *before* joining the army.
* **B: Kufundza umvubukulo (Studying archaeology):** While he studied archaeology, the passage highlights that his key achievement was receiving a degree, which was unprecedented for a royal family member.
* **D: Kufundza ekholeji i-Trinity (Studying at Trinity College):**  While true, the passage isn't about just attending college; it's about *earning a degree*.



"
Ivela kuliphi live imikhumbi i-Trygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: E-Norway**.

The text states: ""Olaf Trygvasson, **indvodza yaseNorway** lebeyitimisele kubuyisa live lakubo ekwenganyelweni yiDanish.""  This directly indicates that Olaf Trygvasson was from Norway.
"
Ngusiphi sikhatsi emlandvweni lapho Ijalimani yaba nelithonya lemasiko lelinemandla e-Estonia?,"The correct answer is **C: Eminyakeni lengu-600 lendlulile**.

The text states: ""Cishe ngelikhulu lesi-15, inshonalanga ye-Estonia beyingaphansi kwemfundziso yemasiko aseGermany..."" This translates to ""Around the 15th century, the territory of Estonia was under the cultural influence of Germany...""  Since the 15th century is approximately 600 years ago, option C is the most accurate.
"
Lulwimi lase-Estonia lacalwa yini?,"The correct answer is **A: Umlingisi Õ/õ**.

The passage states: ""...kwaya ngetinhlavu temagama aseJalimane nenhlavu leyodvwa """"Õ/õ"""" yangetwa."" This translates to ""...and with the German loanwords and the unique character """"Õ/õ"""" were added.""
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, linani lebantfu bemdzabu labakhuluma si-Hindi lishintjashintja ngekuya ngayiphi intfo?","The best answer is **C: Uma bantfu labakhona kuvisisa lolulwimi babaliwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the number of Hindi speakers varies depending on whether *native speakers* are included in the count.  Option C directly addresses this: if a significant number of people *stop* speaking Hindi (perhaps due to assimilation or other reasons), the total number of speakers will decrease.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Uma lulwinisgodzi lolufana kakhulu nesi-Hindi lubaliwe:** While related languages are mentioned, the passage focuses on *Hindi* speakers, not speakers of similar languages.
*   **B: Uma bantfu labakhuluma si-Urdu babaliwe:** The passage mentions Hindi and Urdu, and that speakers often understand each other. However, it doesn't link Urdu speaker numbers to Hindi speaker numbers.
*   **D: Uma bantfu labakhona kufundza lolulwimi babaliwe:**  If people *learn* Hindi, it would *increase* the number of speakers, not change it based on whether they are native speakers or not.



Therefore, the decline in native Hindi speakers is the factor that most directly influences the fluctuation in the total number of Hindi speakers, and option C captures this."
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokusitatimende lesiliciniso mayelana netilwimi i-Hindi kanye ne-Urdu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngalokuvamile kuba nekuncamulwa emkhatsini kwetikhulumi talamalwimi womabili**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""SiHindi nesiUrdu kusebentisa emagama lafanako kepha kuhlukile ngekubhala phansi; ekucocaniseni kwamalanga onkhe, bakhulumi bato totimbili letiliwimi ngalokuvamile bayevana.""
* This translates to: ""Hindi and Urdu use similar words but differ in writing; in general, speakers of both languages can understand each other.""

Therefore, option A accurately reflects this information. Option B is true, but doesn't capture the key point about understandability. Options C and D are incorrect because the passage says they are similar in vocabulary but different in script.



"
Ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokungasilo liciniso lekungilo mayelana nema-alfabethi eHangeul?,"The correct answer is **A: Yasungulwa ekucaleni kwekubusa kweNkosi Sejong**

Here's why:

* The provided text states the Hangeul alphabet was established in 1444, during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).  Therefore, it wasn't established ""ekucaleni"" (at the beginning) of his reign, but *during* it. This makes option A incorrect.
* Options B and C are accurate statements from the text.
* Option D is not mentioned anywhere in the text.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that contradicts the information given in the passage."
I-alfabethi Hunmin Jeongeum igcine ishintjwe yaba yini?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Hangeul**.

The text states that Hunmin Jeongeum is the name of the alphabet, and that the alphabet is known as Hangeul.  Therefore, the alphabet maintained the name Hangeul.
"
Ngekusho kwalendzima ngutiphi tilwimi letitfonye si-Sanskrit,"The correct answer is **A: Tilwimi tesi-Latin**.

The passage explicitly states: ""SiSanskrit lulwimi lwemdzabu futsi lunfananiswa nelulwimi lwesi-Latin lolukhulunywa eYurophu."" This translates to ""Sanskrit is a primitive language and is related to the Latin language spoken in Europe.""
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kusebentiswa kwe-Sanskrit kwancipha ngenca yani?","The correct answer is **B: Kutfutsa kwe-Aryan**.

The text states: ""Emvakwekuhlanganiswa kwe-Upanishads, iSanskrit yanyamalala nje ngenca yalabaphetse."" This translates to ""After the merging of the Upanishads, Sanskrit simply declined due to the decline of its practitioners."" The text then connects the decline of Sanskrit to the decline of the Aryan people who were its speakers.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bunkimbinkimbi (Complexity):** While the text mentions Sanskrit's complexity, it doesn't directly state this as the reason for its decline.
*   **C: Tilwimi taseLatin (Latin Languages):** The text compares Sanskrit to Latin, but doesn't say that the existence of Latin languages caused the decline of Sanskrit.
*   **D: Kubusa (Governance):** The text doesn't mention governance as a factor in the decline of Sanskrit.



"
Ngekusho kwendzima ngikuphi kwesitatimende lekungiso mayelana nemandla ladvonsela ku-lo?,"The correct answer is **C: Mandla a-lo ladvonsela phasi advonsa kakhulu,kungako usindza kakhulu.**

Here's why:

The statement emphasizes the *contrast* between the heavy person's weight and the lighter person's weight *after* the heavy person is pushed down.  The key phrase is ""ngako usindza kakhulu"" which translates to ""therefore, you are very light.""  This directly implies that the force required to move the lighter person *relative to the heavy person's weight* is much greater.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emandla ladvonsela phasi angadvonsa kancane kuwe kunemandla a-lo ladvonsela phasi** - This contradicts the core idea that the lighter person *becomes* heavier relative to the pushing force.
* **B: Mandla a-lo ladvonsela phasi advonsa kakhulu, kungako ungenta kancane** - This is incorrect. The force needed is *not* less, it's more! 
* **D: Emandla ladvonsela phasi angadvonsa kakhulu kuwe kunemandla a-lo ladvonsela phasi** - While the force *is* greater on the lighter person, the statement's primary point is the *relative* change in weight (being ""very light"").




"
Ngekusho kwendzima ngutiphi taletilandzelako titatimende letichaza ngalokungiko luhla lweNyanga lwangaphandle?,"The correct answer is **B: Loluhla lwangaphandle luncane kunetindzawo letisetulu.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lencenye yenyeti lebitwa ngekutsi yi-crust ingemakhilomitha langu 70 bududla ngasehlangotsini loludvute bese iba ngemakhilomitha langu 100 bududla ngasehlangotsini lolukhashane.""  This means the crust is thinner under the ocean (70 km) than it is under the continents (100 km). Therefore, the ocean crust is thinner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Luhlangotsi lolusedvute lune luhla lolungaphandle lolukhulu:** The text explicitly states the *continental* crust is thicker.
* **C: Kungaba na-maria lomncane ehlangotsini lolukhashane:** While maria (dark plains) are found on the lunar surface, the text doesn't link them to the crust's thickness.
* **D: Kungaba na-maria lomncane ngaphasi kwetindzawo letisetulu:** Similar to option C, the text doesn't connect maria to crust thickness.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, kukuphi lapho lucwecwe lweNyanga lulukhulu khona?","The correct answer is **A: Eluhlangotsini loludvutane** (In the western hemisphere).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lencenye yenyeti lebitwa ngekutsi yi-crust ingemakhilomitha langu 70 bududla ngasehlangotsini loludvute bese iba ngemakhilomitha langu 100 bududla ngasehlangotsini lolukhashane."" 

This translates to: ""This rocky part called the crust is 70 kilometers thick on the western hemisphere and 100 kilometers thick on the eastern hemisphere.""

Therefore, the crust is thicker on the western hemisphere.
"
"Ngekusekelwa indzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokukholelwa bantfu labatsite?","The correct answer is **C: Imphilo ikhona kulamanye maulanethi (Life exists on other planets)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""labanye bayatibuta kutsi kunani lengaphandle labanye bakholwa kutsi kukhona tidalwa noma kukhona lokuphilako kuleminye imikhatsi."" (some ask how many are outside, while others believe there is life or something living on other planets.)

The question asks what people believe based on the weight of evidence. The passage then continues to describe the vastness of space and suggests that eventually, people might discover life on other planets.  Therefore, the belief that life exists on other planets is the most logical conclusion drawn from the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bantfu bahambe baya kuletinye tinkhanyeti (People will travel to other planets):** The passage doesn't mention space travel. It focuses on belief based on current evidence.
* **B: Bantfu abakhoni kubuka leminye imihlaba (People cannot see other planets):** While people can't *currently* see other planets easily, the passage is about *belief*, not observation.
* **D: Kunemamayela langaphasi kwetigidzigidzi letiphindvwe ngesigidzi emkhatsini kwetinkhanyeti (There are billions of repeating cycles in the space between planets):**  This is a factual description of space, but it doesn't directly lead to a belief about life.  It's more about the vastness of space.



"
Lokuba kuncane uma uchubeka uhamba usuka emkhatsini kwelilanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Plasma**.

The passage states: ""Lomoya uba muncane nawuchubekela khashane nemkhatsi welilanga. Incenye lengephandle lesiyibonako nasibuka Lilanga ibitwa ngekutsi yi-photosphere, lokusho kutsi """"libhola lekukhanya"""".""  This describes plasma.  Plasma is a state of matter where a gas is so hot that its atoms lose their electrons, resulting in an ionized gas.  It's the most common state of matter in the universe, and the sun is largely composed of plasma.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umlilo (Fire):** While fire is related to heat and light, the passage doesn't specifically mention fire as the state of the sun's matter.
* **C: Igesi (Gas):** The passage says the sun is built of gas *plus* electricity, fire, and plasma. Plasma is a more energetic state than just gas.
* **D: Luhlu lwangaphandle (Outer Layer):** While the photosphere is a layer, the question asks about the *state* of the sun's matter, not just its location.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi incenye yelilanga lebonakalako emhlabeni?","The correct answer is **C: I-phothosphere**.

The passage states: ""Incenye lengephandle lesiyibonako nasibuka Lilanga ibitwa ngekutsi yi-photosphere, lokusho kutsi """"libhola lekukhanya""""."" This translates to: ""The visible outer part of the Sun that we see is called the photosphere, which means 'sphere of light'.""

Therefore, the photosphere is the visible part of the sun.
"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokuphawuliwe lokwasita ekucinisekiseni lokusemcondvweni wa-Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuhamba kwe-Venus**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after Galileo observed the phases of Venus (option A), it was later in 1639 that astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks observed the *transit* of Venus. A transit is when a planet passes directly between the Sun and our line of sight, appearing as a small black dot moving across the Sun's disk.  These transits provided crucial data for confirming Copernicus' heliocentric model (Sun-centered).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tigaba ta-Venus (Phases of Venus):**  While important for Galileo's observations, the passage highlights that the transit of Venus was the next key observation.
* **C: Kufana kweLilanga ne-Venus (Similarity of the Sun and Venus):** The passage mentions Venus having phases *like* the Moon, but it's not the next observation used to confirm Copernicus.
* **D: Kufana kweLilanga neNyeti (Similarity of the Sun and the Moon):**  This is irrelevant to the next step in confirming Copernicus.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokwabonwa ngu-Galileo Galilei ngo-1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Tigaba ta-Venus**.

The passage states: ""nga-1610, umTaliyane losati setinkhanyeti longuGalileo Galilei wasebentisa sibonakudze kuze abone kutsi i-Venus inetigaba, njengoba nje nenyeti inato."" (In 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to see that Venus has phases, just like the moon.)

Therefore, the next observation by Galileo Galilei in 1610 was the phases of Venus.
"
"Ngekusho kwemugca, uwatsatsaphi emanti lomfula i-Amazon?","The correct answer is **A: Imifula lemincane**.

The passage states: ""Utsatsa emanti etinkhulungwaneni temifula lemincane."" which translates to ""It discharges its waters into major rivers.""
"
Ngikuphi kuncoma lokungakabaluleki emfuleni i-Amazon?,"The correct answer is **C: Umfula lomkhulu lomudze wonkhe**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Amazon River is the *second largest by volume* (not by length).
* Option C accurately reflects this information.
* Options A, B, and D are incorrect because the passage states it is the second largest *by volume*, not the largest overall, largest by length, or largest river of people.



"
Ngumuphi umugca wemsebenti locasha inombolo lencane yebantfu base-Venezuela?,"The correct answer is **A: Tekulima (Agriculture)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""munye kulabahlanu basebenta kulima"" which translates to ""one in five people work in agriculture"". This indicates that agriculture is the sector with the smallest percentage of Venezuelan workers mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Indzawo yekukhicita tintfo letitsite (Shipping/Port):** The passage mentions that ""bantfu lababili Kulabatsatfu baseVenezuela labasebentako basebenta encenyeni yekusita"" which translates to ""two in ten Venezuelan workers work in the shipping industry"". This is a relatively higher percentage than agriculture.
* **C: I-Oyila (Oil):** While important to the Venezuelan economy, the passage explicitly states ""kuliphesenti linye nje kuphela lebantfu bakhona labasebenta kulomkhakha"" which means ""only one percent of people are employed in this sector.""  This indicates it's not the sector with the *smallest* number of workers.
* **D: Umsebenti (Work):** This is too general. The question asks for a *specific* sector.



Therefore, agriculture is the sector with the smallest percentage of workers mentioned."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi kulemikhakha lelandzelako lecasha bantfu inombolo lekhulu yebantfu base-Venezuela?","The answer is **B: Tekulima (Agriculture)**.

The text states: ""munye kulabahlanu basebenta kulima"" which translates to ""one in five people work in agriculture.""  This is a larger percentage than the percentages given for the other options.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kuhlangana kutivumela kutsi tenteni tinkhanyeti?","The correct answer is **C: Khipha kukhanya nekushisa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the light and heat emitted from stars comes from the process of hydrogen atoms fusing (combining) to create heavier elements.** This fusion process *releases* energy in the form of light and heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yakha takhi letisindzako (Build heavier elements):** While the fusion *creates* heavier elements, the primary output of the process is energy (light and heat).
* **B: Yakha kuhlangana lokubuyisako (Build a returning combination):** This doesn't accurately describe the process.  It's not about building a combination that returns something.
* **D: Idala i-hydrogen atoms (Create hydrogen atoms):** The process is the *opposite* of creating hydrogen atoms. It's about fusing them together.



"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungentiwa kuhlangana lokubuyisako lokulusito?,"The answer is **D: Emandla (Energy)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a process where energy is released when hydrogen atoms combine to form heavier elements. The core question is about what *next* needs to be understood to replicate this process. The passage explicitly states that scientists are looking for a substance that can release energy in a similar way. Therefore, understanding the nature of energy release in this process is the crucial next step.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Hydrogen:** Hydrogen is a reactant in the process, not the unknown substance being sought.
* **B: Tinkhanyeti (Stars):** Stars are where this process occurs, but the question is about replicating the process artificially, not understanding stars themselves.
* **C: I-Atom (Atom):** The passage mentions atoms, but the key is understanding the energy *released* during the process, not the atom itself.



"
Yini ikhemikhali leyentiwe ngemanti?,"The correct answer is **B: I-hydrogen atom leyodvwa kanye namunye moya lohlobile i-atom**.

The passage states: ""Emanti akhiwa tincenye letimbili tema-athomu e-hydrogen kanye ne-athomu yinye yemoya lesiwuphefumulako."" This translates to: ""Water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of the gas we breathe.""  Therefore, the answer refers to two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
"
Uma emanti ashintja simo yini lokusale kufana?,"The correct answer is **A: Sakhiwo se-molecular (Molecular composition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngisho noma simo semtimba singase sishintje, kodvwa simo semakhemikhali sihlala sinjalo."" This means that even if water changes state (ice, liquid, gas), the way the molecules are arranged (hydrogen and oxygen atoms bonded together) remains the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuminyana (Volume):**  The volume of water changes depending on its state (ice is less dense than liquid water).
* **C: Simo semtimba (Physical state):** The passage explicitly states that the *chemical* state stays the same, even if the *physical* state changes.
* **D: I-nitrogen lemanti (Nitrogen in water):** Water (H2O) does *not* contain nitrogen.

Therefore, the only thing that remains constant is the molecular composition.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungasiyo inkinga yelive lapho itama kujabulisa umtsetfo lotsite?","The correct answer is **A: Kunganyelwa lokukhulu lokuvela kutiphatsimandla tembuso**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Articles of Confederation were weak because Congress lacked the power to tax and had no executive or judicial branch. This resulted in the state governments dominating, and Congress being reliant on their cooperation for funding and to implement laws.  This reliance on state governments and their potential to act independently was a major weakness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kungabi nemandla phakatsi kwencubekelaphambili** - The passage explicitly states there was *no* executive branch. This is a consequence of the Articles' weakness, not a weakness *related to the judiciary*.
*   **C: Tichibiyelo letidzinga kugunyatwa ngelivi linye** - While the Articles required unanimous consent from all states to amend them, this wasn't the *primary* weakness related to the judicial system or power dynamics.
*   **D: Sikhulu selive lonkhe lesingekho** - The passage mentions there was no judicial branch, not a weakness with the *size* of the national judiciary.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende lesiveta ngalokungiko simo sahulumende lomkhulu phakatsi kweMphi Yetingucuko?","The correct answer is **A: Umtsetfo wetintsela uphocelelwe ngukhongolose kanye netiphatsimandla telive.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""The government was weak. Congress had no power to tax, and there was no executive or judicial branch, so it depended on the state legislatures, which could act independently and nullify any laws of the union."" This directly connects the weakness of the central government to its inability to tax and rely on state legislatures for enforcement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tichibiyelo tendzatjana betincike egunyeni lakhongolose:** While states did have power, the passage doesn't say the states relied *solely* on the authority of the Congress.
*   **C: Bameli bembuso abakabi khona:** The passage mentions representatives from each state, not that they were absent.
*   **D: Hulumende lomkhulu bekanetincenye letibili letiyinhloko:** The passage states there were no executive or judicial branches, which contradicts this option.

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the passage's description of the central government's weakness and dependence on state legislatures.
"
Abhalwe njani emagama langemuva kweSimemetelo senkhululeko?,"The correct answer is **C: Kubuke phasi (Written upside down)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngisho noma kutsi lowatiko kutsi yabhalwa ngubani, kuyatiwa kutsi ekucaleni kwekuphila kwayo, idokhumenti yayo lenkhulu (yayingu-29¾ wemasentimitha bese iba ngu-24½ wemasentimitha) beyigocwa kuze igcinwe. Ngako kungenteka kutsi lesimboli lebhaliwe ifakwe njengelebuli."" This translates to ""Although it is said that the text was written by whom, it is said that at the beginning of its life, the large document (which was 29¾ centimeters by 24½ centimeters) was folded so that it was kept. However, it is important that the written symbol was placed as a label."" The label refers to the writing being upside down.



"
I-Singapore idume ngakuphi kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **A: Luhlata lwasemadolobheni (City Garden)**.

The text explicitly states that the Singapore Botanic Gardens transformed into a ""City Garden"". Therefore, the city garden is what Singapore is famous for in this context.
"
Yini iVanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **C: Ingadze yetitjalo (Orchid)**.

The text states: ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, loyiorchid hybrid..."" which translates to ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, a *orchid hybrid*..."" Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is an orchid.
"
Ngekusho kwalendzima ngusiphi sici semaphirimidi ase-Giza lebekungentaki kutsi ingawumangati bukhosi lobusha baseGibhite?,"The correct answer is **C: Bukhulu bato** (Their size).

Here's why:

The question asks what feature of the Giza pyramids would have been astounding to the New Kingdom Egyptians. The passage states that even though the pyramids were built at the end of the Old Kingdom, their size still amazed the New Kingdom Egyptians. They were bewildered by the scale and the fact that the structures were thousands of years old.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Umnyaka wato** (The year they were built) - While the age was impressive, the passage emphasizes the *size* as the primary source of awe.
* **B: Kusetjentiswa kwelitje** (The use of tools) -  The passage implies that while the technology was advanced, it wasn't unbelievably so for the time.  The question highlights astonishment at the sheer *scale*.
* **D: Sakhiwe sabo** (Built by them) - The Egyptians knew they built the pyramids. The mystery wasn't *who* built them, but *how* they built them on such a monumental scale.



Therefore, the monumental **size** of the pyramids is the most logical answer.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, tisuka tibuya kuphi tilwane letidla tjani uma tilandzela imvula?","The correct answer is **C: Ematsafa seningizimu (Southern Plains)**.

The passage states: ""Yonkhe iminyaka ngabo-October cishe tilwane letitigidzi letingu-1.5 letidla titjalo tiyahamba tiye ngaseningizimu, tewele Umfula iMara, tisuka etintsabeni letingasenyakatfo kuze titfole imvula.""

This translates to: ""Every year around October, about a million herbivores migrate south, cross the Mara River, coming from the northern plains to reach the rain.""

Therefore, they move to the southern plains *after* the rains.
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, nguyiphi indzawo tilwane letidla tjani letisuka kuyo kusukela ngesikhatsi sa-April?","The correct answer is **C: Umfula i-Mara**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Futsi uphindze abuye enyakatfo angena ngasenshonalanga, endlula emfuleni i-Mara, ngemuva kwetimvula tanga-April."" This directly indicates that the animals returned via the Mara River after the rains in April. Therefore, the Mara River is the place they came from.
"
Kusebenta kwaSealion kwaba kuhlasela kwaliphi live?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Britain**.

The text states that ""Ikhodi yaseJalimane yetsa lokuhlasela ngekutsi """"yi-Operation Sealion"""".  I-Operation Sealion was Germany's plan to invade Britain.

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
Akubite ngani emaJalimani kuhlasela eBritain?,"The correct answer is **B: Kusebenta Sealion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ikhodi yaseJalimane yetsa lokuhlasela ngekutsi """"yi-Operation Sealion"""".""  This means ""Operation Sealion"" was the German code for their planned invasion of Britain.
"
Yini lengakashiwo njengesinyatselo lesidzingekako ehlelweni le-Italy lekuthumba emave ase-Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwakha i-pad yekucalisa yeliciniso (Building a precise launching pad)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that to enter African territories, the Italians needed a navy to traverse the Mediterranean. It also mentions they needed to differentiate themselves from British and Egyptian naval power.  The passage mentions separating from British and Egyptian principles, and developing their own naval strength.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kususa imikhumbi eGibhithe (Removing Egyptian ships):** While differentiating themselves from Egyptian naval power is important, the text doesn't specifically say *removing* Egyptian ships was a primary necessity.
*   **B: Kwakha imikhumbi lengetiwe (Building armored ships):** The passage indicates that a navy was necessary but it does not specifically state they needed *armored* ships.
*   **D: Kubhidlita tisekelo taseBritain (Destroying British bases):** The passage states separating from British principles. It does not mention destroying British bases.

Therefore, the passage doesn't say anything about building a *precise launching pad*, which is not mentioned as a key element in their plan to conquer Africa.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, yini lebeyibukwa njenjongo yekucala ye-Italy ngalemphi?","The correct answer is **A: Kutfumba emave ase-Afrika**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ugomo wayo loyinhloko bekukungena emaveni ase-Afrika."" (Its main goal was to enter the African continent.)  The other options are mentioned as *necessary steps* to achieve that goal, but not the primary goal itself.
"
Ngubani lowakhe budlelwane bebungani nebahlaseli?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Vichy French**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Beyibuswa ngu """"Vichy"""" French. Laba bekubantfu baseFrance lebente kuthula nemaJalimane nga-1940 futsi basebenta nalabo lebangenile kunekutsi balwe nabo.""  This means the Vichy French were allied with the Germans.
"
Bobani labangani bebabandzanyekile ku-Operation Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Bantfu base-Melika kanye nema-French Lakhululekile.**

The text states: ""Ngemaviki lamabili nje kuphela emaMelika nemabutfo ase France lebesekakhululiwe, akhulula incenye leseNingizimu ye France futsi besekayokhulula nemaJalimane.""  This directly indicates that American and French forces liberated the region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ema-French ase-Vichy kanye nema-Americans:** The Vichy French were collaborating with the Germans, not liberating with the Americans.
* **C: EmaJalimani kanye nema-French:** The Germans were the occupying force, not liberators.
* **D: Bantfu baseMelika kanye nemaJalimani:** The Americans were fighting *against* the Germans.



"
Umnyango wabuphi bucwepheshe lodale kutsi imikhumbingwenya ihambe ngaphansi kwemanti?,"The correct answer is **A: Tikebhe te-U**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Imikhumbi yaseJalimane lehamba ngaphansi kwemanti yayibitwa ngekutsi yi-U-Boats."" (German submarines that sailed underwater were called U-Boats.)

The passage also describes how the U-boats operated and their effectiveness during the war. The other options (Luhlalekudubula - Radar, Kuzulazula - Navigation, Irada - Radio) are not mentioned in relation to the submarines' underwater capabilities.
"
"Ekusebentisweni kwawo kwekucala, imikhumbingwenya beyinebubanti lobukalekile kakhulu kuyiphi indzawo?","The correct answer is **C: Dubula**.

The text states: ""Ngaleso sikhatsi beyihamba kancane kakhulu futsi beyingakhoni kudubula endzaweni lekhashane."" which translates to ""At that time, they were moving very slowly and were unable to attack in shallow waters.""  Therefore, ""dubula"" (attack) is the correct choice.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lophule sivumelwano? ","The correct answer is **A: BasePoland**.

The text states: ""Ngenyanga yeNyoni 17, 1939, umbutfo wetekuvikela wasePolish besewonakele, lokwakuwukuphela kwelitsemba kwakuwukutsi batihlanganise nelibutfo laseRoma. Kodvwa, lamacebo kwatsiwa ngeke asasebenta ngebusuku bunye nje, ngenca yemasotja lati-800,000 lasuka kuSoviet Union Red Army langena futsi akha tingcinamba taseBelarussia nase Ukraine ngemva kwekuhlasela tigodzi tasemphumalanga yePoland ephula umtsetfo iRiga Peace Treaty, neSoviet-Polish Non-Agression Pact, naleminye imitsetfo yemave emhlaba, lehlanganisa lamave omabili nalamanye lamanyenti.""

This translates to: ""On April 17, 1939, the Polish defense forces were exhausted, and their only hope was to join the Roman army. However, these plans were not going to work overnight, due to 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union Red Army entering and building fortifications in Belarus and Ukraine after the lightning strike on Poland, which violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, combining the two above with others.""

The text explicitly mentions that Poland violated the Riga Peace Treaty and the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Therefore, Poland is the country that broke the agreements.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakentiwa i-Red Army?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuhlaselwa kwetifundza tasempumalanga (Attacking eastern regions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Red Army advanced and *established fortifications* in Belarus and Ukraine.  Option B, ""Attacking eastern regions,"" is a general statement and not directly mentioned as a specific action taken by the Red Army in the text.

The passage does mention:

* **A: Kwakhiwa kwebuso be-Ukrainian (Establishing a Ukrainian government):**  The Soviet Union was actively involved in establishing puppet governments in regions they occupied.
* **C: Kuhlelwa kabusha kwelibhuloho (Reorganizing the army):** This is implied by the large numbers of troops and the establishment of fortifications, suggesting a reorganization of forces.
* **D: Kwephulwa kwesivumelwano (Violating an agreement):** The entire passage revolves around the violation of the Riga Peace Treaty and the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact.

Therefore, the only option not directly supported by the text is B.
"
Kwentekani kunjiniyela lomkhuli weMasotja Elishumi ase-Italy?,"The correct answer is **C: Uthunjwe maBritish**.

The text states: ""Emhlakaniphile kwemphumalanga yeBardia, emaBritish abamba Njiniyela Losetulu Welishumi Wase-Italy, General Lastucci."" This translates to ""In the southern assault of Bardia, the British captured Italian Lieutenant General Lastucci.""
"
Wabulalelwaphi Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: E-Tobruk**.

The passage states: ""Mhlaka-28 iNhlaba, Marshal Italo Balbo, loMbusi-Jikelele waseLibya futsi lobekufanele adle lifa laMussolini, wabulawa ngumlilo nakafika eTobruk."" This translates to: ""On Earth Day, Marshal Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and who was supposed to eat Mussolini's ashes, was killed by fire and arrived in Tobruk.""
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguwaphi emasu kulalandzelako layincenye lebalulekile yekuzindla kwe-Tibetan?","The correct answer is **B: Emavi laphindvwaphindvwako (Energy channels)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Tibetan Buddhism, influenced by Indian Yoga, incorporates Kundalini Yoga. Kundalini Yoga focuses on awakening Kundalini energy, which is described as rising through energy channels (nadis) in the body.  The passage highlights that this awakening affects the breath, the subtle body, and the perception of reality. Therefore, the energy channels are a crucial element of Tibetan Buddhist practice related to the body.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kutijwayeta tivivinyo tekuphefemula (Breathwork exercises):** While breathwork is *part* of the practice, the passage emphasizes the energy channels as the *path* for the energy's movement and transformation.
* **C: Kubona boNkulunkulu ngeliso lengcondvo (Vision of deities with the inner eye):** Deity Yoga is mentioned, but the passage focuses on the foundational aspects of the practice first.  The inner eye vision is a result of deeper practice, not the core component of the body's structure.
* **D: Kuvisisa kuma kwe-yoga (Incorporating yoga postures):** While incorporating yoga postures is part of the practice, the passage emphasizes the energy channels and the rising of Kundalini energy as more central to the physical aspect of Tibetan Buddhism.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, i-Chakras ivulwa njani ibeketelela “sikhungo” semitsi yase-Tibetan?","The correct answer is **A: Ngekusebentisa timo letihlukene te-yoga**.

Here's why:

The text states that Tibetan Buddhism incorporates Kundalini Yoga and other practices. Kundalini Yoga specifically focuses on awakening the Kundalini energy, which is believed to rise through the chakras. The text also mentions ""timo letihlukene te-yoga"" (various yoga practices) as a way to open the chakras.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ngekubona boNkulunkulu ngeliso lengcondvo** - While deity yoga is mentioned, it's about visualization and developing qualities associated with deities, not directly about opening chakras through physical or energetic practices.
*   **C: Kuphindzphindzeka kwemavi** - The text does not mention water practices as a method for opening chakras.
*   **D: Kutijwayeta tivivinyo tekuphefemula** - While breathwork (pranayama) is a crucial part of yoga and can influence the chakras, the text speaks of ""timo letihlukene te-yoga"" which implies a broader range of practices, not just breathwork.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **A**.



"
Ngubani lothule ingoma yesibili yemkhuleko phakatsi ehlelweni?,"The correct answer is **A: NguSanju Sharma**.

The text states: ""Umhlabeleli lokungu Sanju Sharma nguye locale kuhlabela kulobusuku, walandzelwa nguJai Shankar Choudhary."" This means Sanju Sharma was the initial host and therefore introduced the second song.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lowathula ingoma yemkhuleko ngalesikhatsi kunikelwa kudla?","The correct answer is **A: NguLakkha Singh**.

The passage states: ""Lakkha Singh wahola kuhlabela i-bhajans."" (Lakkha Singh led the chanting of the bhajans).  It also mentions that he sang the ""chhappan bhog bhajan."" Therefore, he is the one who led the devotional singing during the food offering.
"
Bekungumuphi umdlalo wesibili ekugcineni kwebusuku?,"The correct answer is **B: Umlilo wa-Anatolia**.

The text states: ""Kucedzela, licembu lekudansa iFire of Anatolia lenta lombukiso i""""Troy"""".""  This translates to ""Furthermore, the dance performance Fire of Anatolia is part of the show Troy."" This implies it was the final performance.
"
Ngubuphi buve ba-Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Wase-Italy**.

The text explicitly states: ""...nemhlabeli we-tenor wase-Italy Alessandro Safina..."""
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngusiphi kuletitatimende letilandzelako lesingasilo liciniso?","The correct answer is **C: Bagibeli banikwe emanti**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Bagibeli banikwe emanti njengoba bebalindze endzaweni leshisa nga-90(F)-wemadigri."" (Babies were given water as they waited in the scorching line at 90(F) degrees.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bekunemlilo e-Santa Clara** (There was a fire in Santa Clara): The text mentions the heat, but not a fire.
* **B: Bantfu bebakhacamele ku-roller coaster** (People fainted on the roller coaster): The text says it was uncomfortable to ride the roller coaster *because* of the heat, but doesn't say people actually fainted.
* **D: Kutsatse lokungenani imizuzu lengu-60 kukhipha umuntfu wekucala lobekagibele lomshini wekutijabulisa** (It took at least 60 minutes to remove a baby who had been left on the ride): The text says it took *at least one hour* to remove the baby.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lophawulile mayelana nekungakhululeki kwelizinga lekushisa?","The correct answer is **B: Umphatsi wemlilo**.

The text specifically states: ""Kapteni wemlilo Scott Kouns utsi..."" which identifies him as the firefighter who made the comment about the discomfort caused by the heat.
"
Lapho bekuncamuka khona gezi ngenca yeTsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: E-Tonga**.

The text states: ""Kute umonakalo lomkhulu noma kulimala lokubikiwe eTonga, kepha gesi wahamba kwesikhashana..."" This directly indicates that the gas (likely related to the tsunami) was observed in Tonga.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, beyitsintseka kanjani iTonga ngekuncamuka kwagezi?","The correct answer is **B: Tiphatsimandla atimange titfole tindzaba mayelana neticwayiso letiphakamisiwe.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...umonakalo lomkhulu noma kulimala lokubikiwe eTonga, kepha gesi wahamba kwesikhashana, lokwavimbela tiphatsimandla taseTonga kutsi tive lesicwayiso setsunami lesakhishwa yiPTWC.""

This directly translates to: ""...no major damage or injuries have been reported in Tonga, but power went out briefly, preventing Tongan authorities from receiving the tsunami warning issued by the PTWC.""

Therefore, the primary impact on Tonga was the lack of access to the tsunami warning, which prevented them from preparing or taking action. While there might be other consequences, the text specifically highlights the inability to receive the warning as the immediate effect.



Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Bekunembiko wemonakalo:** While the text mentions no major damage, it doesn't say there *were* reports of damage. It says there were *no major damage reports*.
* **C: Kufundvwa kwelizinga lelulwandle kwatsintseka:** The text says the sea level *was* observed to have changed, but doesn't discuss the impact of this change.
* **D: Tiphatsimandla atikakhoni kutfola ticwayiso letifanele:**  The text says they *couldn't* receive the warning, not that they couldn't receive the warning *itself*. The problem was the power outage preventing reception.



"
Emaphoyisa ayokhona nini kusebentisa tibhamu tawo tematubane kute bashaye sivinini sekushayela kwaJonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngalesikhatsi ahamba ngesivinini lesingetulu kwa-160 emakhilomitha ngelihora**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that police used their speed guns when Jonny Reid was driving his car, ""Black Beauty,"" at a speed exceeding 160km/h over the Auckland Harbour Bridge.
* It also explicitly says that the police were able to determine his speed was around 160km/h *at that specific moment*.

Therefore, the police used their speed guns when he was driving at a speed *over* 160km/h, specifically when they were able to measure it. Option C accurately reflects this.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani kumatima emaphoyiseni ase-New Zealand kubamba sivinini saJonny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: Bekahamba ngesivinini lesingaphasi kwa-160 emakhilomitha ngelihora**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Mr. Reid ukhonile kushayela imoto i-A1GP yeNew Zealand, iBlack Beauty ngesivinini lesingetulu kwa 160km/h kasikhombisa ngenhla kwelibhuloho.""  This means he *exceeded* 160km/h.
* The passage also says, ""Emaphoyisa aseNew Zealand bekanebumatima kusebentisa letibhamu tabo letinesivinini kubona kutsi Umnumzane Reid bekagijima kakhulu ngelizinga lelinganani ngenca yekutsi Black Beauty unjani, futsi lesikhatsi lesisodvwa lamaphoyisa lakhone kufundza ngaso sivinini seMnumzane Reid kwaba ngulapho ehlisa sivinini kuya ku-160km/h."" This indicates the police were concerned because his speed was *above* 160km/h, and they measured his speed dropping *to* 160km/h.

Options B, C, and D are not supported by the text. The weight of the car, the fact that he was driving on the bridge, and the bridge's length are not mentioned as reasons for the police's concern about his speed.



"
Kutamatama kwemhlaba bekugcile kuphi macondzana ne-Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 emamayela eningizimu**.

The text states the earthquake was approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Butte.
"
Kwentekani ngesikhatsi seludlame e-Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **C: Emasotja ase-US atsatsa kulawula.**

Here's why:

The question asks what happened at Abu Ghraib during the war. The provided text states: ""Lelijele lacala kuba yingoti emva kwekutfolakala kwekuhlukubeteka kwetiboshwa emvakwekutsi libutfo leMelika litsatse kubusa."" (This prison became a symbol after the revelation of the abuse of prisoners after the American government overthrew the king.)

This directly links the abuse at Abu Ghraib to the actions of US soldiers.  Options A and B are related to the abuse, but not the *cause* of the abuse. Option D is incorrect, the prison wasn't burned.



"
Kungani lijele lase-Iraqi lizuze ludvumo? ,"The correct answer is **D: Kutfolakala kwekuhlukunyetwa kwetiboshwa (Discovery of prisoner abuse)**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""Lelijele lacala kuba yingoti emva kwekutfolakala kwekuhlukunyetwa kwetiboshwa emvakwekutsi libutfo leMelika litsatse kubusa."" (The prison became notorious after the discovery of prisoner abuse following the US overthrow of the dictator.)

Therefore, the abuse of prisoners is the reason for the prison's notoriety.
"
Luhlobo luni lemcimbi lobowutawuba eMaui War Memorial Stadium?,"The correct answer is **A: Umbukiso wemlingo (Magic show)**.

The text states: ""Lelicembu lebahlabeleli likhansele umbukiso..."" which translates to ""This large venue hosted a magic show...""
"
Lowagcina anikete inchazelo mayelana nekuhociswa kwemcimbi?,"The correct answer is **A: Licembu (The Stadium)**.

The passage states: ""Lelicembu lebahlabeleli likhansele umbukiso..."" which translates to ""The stadium hosted the show..."" and then describes the cancellation. The stadium itself is the subject of the cancellation.

While the other options are involved, the *reason* for the cancellation is the stadium.
"
Bobani labaningana betakhamuti tase-Bishkek labacabanga kutsi banelicala lekuphanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Babhikishi (Smugglers)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Takhamuti letinyenti taseBishkek tibhikishe tisuka eningizimu tikhala ngekwephulwa kwemtsetfo."" This translates to: ""The **smugglers** of Bishkek are being destroyed from the south through illegal crossings.""  Therefore, the people who are involved in illegal trade and smuggling are the smugglers (""babhikishi"").
"
Ngubani losole babhikishi baseningizimu ngekutapa?,"The correct answer is **A: Takhamuti tase-Bishkek (Bishkek shops)**.

The passage states: ""Takhamuti taseBishkek tibhikishe tisuka eningizimu tikhala ngekwephulwa kwemtsetfo"" which translates to ""Bishkek shops were looted from the south due to the breaking of the fence.""
"
Ngubani lowatfola indandatho lekhuphule intsengo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemuva kwekuvela ku-QVC**.

The text states: ""Kutsengiswa kukhuphukile ngemuva kwekuvela kwakhe nga-2013 eluhlelweni lolutsi Shark Tank lapho loluhlelo belukhuluma ngekwehla lobekubonake ekusekeleni. **Ngasekupheleni kwa-2017, Siminoff savela esikhangisweni lesikumabonakudze esiteshini i-QVC.**"" This clearly indicates a significant increase in sales after appearing on QVC.
"
Jamie Siminoff ukhetse nini kucala i-Ring?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngemuva kwekuvela Kwelithangi Lashaka lelihlulekile.**

The text states: ""Esikhatsi esedlule, CEO weRing's, Jamie Siminoff, watsi lenkapane yacala ngesikhatsi insimbi lesemnyango wakhe bewungavakali kahle umsindvo wayo esitolo sakhe nawusegaraji. Utsi wakhe ibheli ye-WiFi yasemnyango. Siminoff utsi kutsengiswa kukhuphukile ngemuva kwekuvela kwakhe nga-2013 eluhlelweni lolutsi Shark Tank lapho loluhlelo belukhuluma ngekwehla lobekubonake ekusekeleni."" This implies the company was founded *after* his unsuccessful appearance on Shark Tank in 2013.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the doorbell issue was a catalyst, it wasn't the *reason* he started the company.
*   **C:** The text doesn't mention him getting funding.
*   **D:**  The QVC appearance happened *after* the company was already established and gaining traction.



"
Sicephu ngasinye semusho wenkosatane saloko lokugcinela indzawo yekuhlala?,"The correct answer is **D: Tincwadzi (Books)**.

The passage states that each episode of *Reading Rainbow* focuses on a book and is designed to encourage children to explore books and visit libraries.
"
Lokungenteka kube nemtselela ekusuleni Luchungechunge lekufudza umusho wenkosatana?,"The correct answer is **C: Umbono waJohn Grant**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly quotes John Grant saying, ""...[Reading Rainbow] *taught* children to read... the *hand of reading* - [the show] gently encourages children to explore books and read."" This directly addresses the question of what makes the show effective in fostering a love of reading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Luchaso lolunganeli (Lack of awards):** The passage states the show *does* have Emmy awards.
* **B: Kushoda kwemiklomelo ye-Emmy (Few Emmy awards):**  Again, the passage contradicts this, saying there are many.
* **D: Impumelelo yemphatsiswa Rogers endzaweni (Rogers' success in the field):** While Mister Rogers' Neighborhood is mentioned as a comparison, the passage focuses on Reading Rainbow's specific effectiveness, and not on Rogers' general success.



Therefore, John Grant's statement about the show teaching children to read and encouraging exploration of books is the most direct answer to the question about what makes the series effective in fostering a love of reading."
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo ingcabano leyentiwe tikhulu te-Amsterdam kanye ne-Museum mayelana nesihlahla?,"The correct answer is **C: Ingcoliswe lukhunta (Burned to ashes)**.

Here's why:

The question states that the city of Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Museum emphasize the importance of preserving the house as a living testament to Anne Frank's life.  Burning it to ashes would be the *opposite* of preserving it. The other options are all possibilities for preserving a historical site:

*   **A: Nakanjani itawuwa (It will certainly be preserved):** This aligns with the emphasized importance of preservation.
*   **B: Kufanele igcinwe (It should be preserved):**  This is a direct reflection of the museum's stated position.
*   **D: Ingoti imphilweni yemphakatsi (The house is a testament to life):**  This is exactly what the city and museum want to convey.



"
Ngekwemhloli lomkhulu wekuhlolwa kwe-RSPCA kufanele kube kutayelekile kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **A: Ikhamera ye-CCTV**.

The text explicitly states that the RSPCA and Animal Welfare League are calling for the installation of CCTV cameras in all places where animals are killed. David O'Shannessy, the head investigator at RSPCA New South Wales, said that surveillance and investigation of animal killings should be a constant thing in Australia.  This directly links the CCTV cameras to the need for better animal welfare.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengasita ekuciniseni kubaluleka kwenhlalakahle yetilwane kubasebenti base-Australia labahlindzako?","The correct answer is **A: Kufakwa kwekhamera i-CCTV**.

The passage explicitly states that the RSPCA and Animal Welfare League are calling for the *installation of CCTV cameras* in all places where animals are slaughtered. The quote from David O'Shannessy emphasizes that this will ""undoubtedly deter"" people who work with animals, reinforcing the importance of animal welfare.

While the other options are related to the issue, they aren't the primary focus of the call to action. The core of the proposal is the CCTV cameras.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini umsebenti walomuntfu loboshiwe?","The correct answer is **A: Mfundzi (Student)**.

The text states: ""...umfundzi uboshiwe mayelana nalokudubula kwasesikolweni..."" which translates to ""...a student was arrested in connection with the school shooting...""
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani kusabalala tindzaba tekutsi kubanjwe lomunye umngwabo loboshiwe ngoba bangaki labahlukumetekile?","The correct answer is **C: Imfica**.

The text states: ""...nalabanye labatsatfu kulabantfu labayimfica labatsintsekile wachubeka nalomunye umfundzi uboshiwe..."" This indicates that there were three other people who were also injured/affected (imfica). Therefore, the arrest is being reported because of the *total* number of people involved, including the injured/affected individuals.
"
Ekuphendvuleni umbhikisho nguliphi live lelingamange lichubekele phambili nesivumelwano salo se-ACTA?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Poland**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kenyanga lendlulile, bekunemibhikisho leminingi lebeyenteka ePoland ngesikhatsi lelive lisayina i-ACTA..."" This directly links the protests in Poland to the ACTA agreement.  While other countries protested ACTA, the text highlights Poland as having significant and recent protests *specifically* related to the agreement.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngumaphi emave lalandzelako kuhlehlisa inchubo yekujoyina i-ACTA?","The answer is **D: I-Latvia**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ILatvia neSlovakia bonkhe baphutile ngeluhlelo lwekujoyina i-ACTA."" This directly indicates that Latvia is among the countries that *oppose* joining ACTA, implying they find it detrimental.

The other options are not mentioned as being opposed to ACTA in the text:

*   Estonia is mentioned as a location where protests occurred, but not regarding ACTA specifically.
*   Lithuania is mentioned as a location where protests occurred, but not regarding ACTA specifically.
*   Scotland is mentioned in the context of protests in London, but not regarding ACTA.



"
Bangaki bantfu labalimele ngenca yetigameko tekushisa kakhulu kwe-iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""...kukhula sibalo setigameko temililo letisitfupha nekusha lokungasiko kukhulu webantfu labane."" which translates to ""...the number of unusual fires and repairs has grown significantly among four people.""
"
Ngubani lowatse sigameko sekushisa ngalokwecile besingasisibi kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: I-METI**.

The text states: ""INdvuna yeliTiko Letemnotfo, Netekutsengiselana eJapan (MET) itse beloku yati ngetingoti letingu 27 letimayelana nemadivaysi.""  This directly identifies METI as the one who reported the overheating incidents.
"
Ngesikhatsi senkhuluma indzaba Steve Jobs atsi li-apula litayisungula ngekushesha?,"The correct answer is **B: Lolucingo**.

The quote says: ""...Lamuhla i-Apple itokwakha kabusha **lucingo**, sitocopha umlandvo lamuhla..."" which translates to ""...Today Apple is reinventing the **computer**, we are capturing today's feedback...""

Therefore, the answer is **B: Lolucingo** (The computer).
"
Bekuyini inhloso yenkhuluma ya-Steve Jobs yemahora lamabili?,"The correct answer is **D: kumemetela umhlalaphasi wakhe** (to announce to the world).

Here's why:

* The passage states Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone on stage. This is a public event designed to introduce a new product to the world.
* His quote, ""Today, Apple is reinventing the phone, we're taking feedback today,"" suggests he was announcing a significant change and inviting the audience to be part of it.
* Announcing a new product like the iPhone is a key part of marketing and engaging the public.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kucalisa ithebulethi lesha** (To announce a new tablet): While Apple makes tablets, the passage specifically mentions the iPhone.
* **B: Kucalisa ngcondvomshini** (To announce a new machine): This is too vague. While the iPhone is a machine, the context suggests a broader announcement.
* **C: Kucalisa makhalekhikhini** (To announce to shareholders): While shareholders are important, the event was clearly aimed at a wider audience.



"
Yindzaba Cristina Fernandez ayikamenteli enkhundleni yemidlalo yase-Argentine?,"The correct answer is **C: Umkhankaso wakhe welitsimba lesifundzve sase-Buenos Aires.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Mrs. Kirchner utfule inhloso yakhe yekungenela kuba ngumongameli e-Argentine Theatre, indzawo layisebentisa ngesikhatsi acala umkhankaso wakhe wanga-2005 wekuba yi-Senate njengelilunga lesifundza leBuenos Aires.""  This translates to: ""Mrs. Kirchner claimed her intention to be president of the Argentine Theatre, a place she used during her 2005 campaign for Senate as a candidate for the Buenos Aires province.""

Options A, B, and D are incorrect because:

*   **A: Longenele lukhutfo lokungamela** (Intends to flee the country) - The text doesn't mention anything about her fleeing.
*   **B: Inhloso yakhe yekuphatsa umbuso** (Her intention is to seize power) - While she *was* president, the text describes her intention related to a *campaign* for a different role.
*   **D: Luhlelo lwakhe lekushiya sikhundla sekuba lilunga lephalamende njenganyalo** (Her plan to leave her position as a senator again) - The text says she is trying to *return* to a Senate position, not leave one.



"
Christina Fernandez umemetele kuphi inhloso yakhe yekugijima?,"The correct answer is **B: e-Buenos aires inkundla e-La Plata**.

The text states: ""...lidolobha lelichele ngemakhilomitha langu-50 (emamayela langu-31) eBuenos Aires."" and that she was at ""Argentine Theatre, indzawo layisebentisa ngesikhatsi acala umkhankaso wakhe wanga-2005 wekuba yi-Senate njengelilunga lesifundza leBuenos Aires.""

This means she was at the Argentine Theatre in La Plata, which is 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires. The question asks where she *declared* her intention to run. The text doesn't explicitly say she declared it *in* La Plata, but rather at the theatre *in* La Plata, using a location close to Buenos Aires and a site of previous political activity. Therefore, option B is the most accurate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bonkhe inkundleni yemidlalo yeshashalazi lengemamayela langu-31**: This is vague and doesn't pinpoint the location.
*   **C: Konkhe enkunfleni yase argentima 31 emamayela kusuka e-buenos**:  This is grammatically incorrect and doesn't accurately describe the situation.
*   **D: Enkundleni yemdlalo yaseshashalatini lase-Bueson Aires**:  This is misspelled (Bueson instead of Buenos) and doesn't reflect the location in La Plata.



"
Yini letfolwe yi-ACMA mayelana neBig brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Imitsetfo yokucwaninga beyingakaphulwa (The regulations are not being enforced)**.

Here's why:

The question states that the ACMA (Independent Communications Authority of Monitor) has found that the Big Brother show is playing videos online that violate internet regulations. However, the Big Brother website doesn't seem to be addressing this issue, implying the regulations aren't being enforced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kutfolwe kutsi imidiya ibangcwine sekusizindzalwati le-big brothe (It was found that the media is biased in favor of Big Brother)** - The question doesn't mention bias.
* **C: Imitsetfo yokucwaninha yephuliwe (The regulations were broken)** - While the regulations *were* violated, the core point is that they are *not being enforced*.
* **D: Lokucuketfwe kutholwe kutsi bekuhlala cobo endzaweniyekusebenta (The content was found to have always been on the website)** - This is not directly supported by the text. The issue is the *online distribution* of the videos, not necessarily that they've always been there.



"
Ngutiphi tinhlaka lekufanele imidiya iwele ngaphasi kwayo kute icabangele lokucuketfwe i-inthanethi?,"The correct answer is **D: Kufanele ngigunyatwe yi-AcmA (It must be authorized by ACMA)**.

Here's why:

The question states that even though the Broadcasting Services Act governs online content, the content must be subject to **monitoring and control online**. This implies a regulatory body needs to approve or authorize content to ensure it complies with regulations. ACMA (Independent Communications Authority of South Africa) is the regulatory body responsible for broadcasting and communications in South Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kufanele ngisakatwe ku-inthaneyhi (It must be broadcast online):**  This is irrelevant to the issue of content regulation.
* **B: Kumele ngekweliciniso uhlale endzaweni ukhonta (It must be physically kept at a station):**  This is incorrect as online content is digital and doesn't require physical storage at a station.
* **C: Angikwati kugcinwa ku-webhusayidi (It cannot be stored on a website):**  This is incorrect; content *can* be stored on a website, but it needs to comply with regulations.



"
Ngubani umholi we-Liberal Party yase-Australia?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Peter Costello**.

The text states: ""Peter Costello...nendvodza lebhekeke kutsi ilandzele Ndvunankhulu John Howard...njengemholi welicembu leLiberal..."" This directly indicates that Peter Costello was the leader of the Liberal Party at the time.
"
Kungani i-Australia ibete kwakudzala imboni yemandla enuzi ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kweswela kusekelwa ngumphakatsi (It is supported by the treasury)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Peter Costello, treasurer and a figure who followed Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the Liberal party, came out in support of the Australia nuclear power industry.""  This directly indicates that the *treasury* (Costello's position) is supporting the nuclear power industry.

The text also highlights Costello's argument: ""If we are in government, we should use it. That means we must oppose the nuclear power agenda."" This implies the treasury is *against* opposing the nuclear power agenda and, by extension, *for* it.

Therefore, the treasury's support (which is the ""umphakatsi"" in the question) is the reason for the nuclear power industry's development.  The other options are contradicted by the text.
"
Ngumuphi umshwibi locudzelana naye ngelusito lemhlahlandlela?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Anna Jochemsen**.

The text states: ""Njengoba ngelilanga kuba netindondo letilishumi nesiphohlongo kuphela, emave lamanyenti ehlulekile kutfola tindondo. **Ifaka ekhatsi iNetherlands, nga-Anna Jochemsen locedze asendzweni yemfica kubantfu besifazane kuSuper-G itolo**...""

This directly identifies Anna Jochemsen as the first person mentioned in the text who had a poor result in a Super-G race.
"
Nguliphi live lelicadze endzaweni Yelishimi ku-Super-G Kubesifazana labamile?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Finland**.

The text states: ""Katja Saarinen wase Finland yena lobe sendzaweni yelishumi kulomcudzelwano."" This translates to ""Katja Saarinen from Finland finished in the tenth position in the competition.""
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende lesimayelana ne-Blake lesingasiso selucobo?","The correct answer is **A: Waboshwa kulendzawo yesigameko**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for a statement that *doesn't* indicate guilt.** Being arrested at the scene is a factual statement about where he was found, not an admission of guilt.
* **B: Wavuma kuhlasela** - The text says he *opposed* the claim of having used the shelter to defend himself.
* **C: Wasebentise lipali ngesikhatsi sekuhlasela** - The text mentions he was found with a knife.
* **D: Watse emabhodlela ajikijelwe kuye** - The text says he was allegedly attacked with bottles.

Therefore, the only statement that doesn't imply guilt is that he was arrested at the scene."
"Ngalokusekelwe kulendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungamange kwente ku-Blake?","The correct answer is **D: Watjelwa kutsi kungenteka atfunyelwe ejele**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lelijaji latjela Blake kutsi """"cishe kutokwenteka"""" kutsi utotfunyelwa ejele."" This translates to ""The judge told Blake that it is almost likely that he will be sent to jail.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Watfolakala anelicala lekuhlaneketela bulungiswa:** The passage mentions he had a separate charge for obstructing a police officer, not a charge for attacking justice.
*   **B: Waboshwa:** While the passage mentions he *was* arrested initially, the question asks about the *next* thing that might happen, and the judge's statement about potential jail time is the most logical next step.
*   **C: Wahlaselwa ngelipali:** The passage says he *opposed* claims he was using the gate for self-defense, implying he was accused of attacking people, not that he was attacked.

Therefore, the most direct and logical consequence mentioned in the passage is the possibility of jail time.
"
Ingabe yini sikhwama se-U.N. sekufutfumala kwemhlaba ngekwawo lesingeke sisetjentiselwe kona?,"The correct answer is **D: Kunciphisa imiphumela yekufutfumala kwemhlaba ngekwawo**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the U.N. hopes to use the money to ""address the consequences of global warming.""
* The options describe various ways the money could be spent. Option D, ""Kunciphisa imiphumela yekufutfumala kwemhlaba ngekwawo"" (addressing the consequences of global warming), is the most encompassing and directly aligns with the U.N.'s stated goal. While options A, B, and C are things the money could be used for, they are all aspects of addressing the consequences of global warming. 

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and comprehensive answer.
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, yini i-U.N. lenelitsemba lekuyisindzisa?","The correct answer is **A: Imali, ngekwabelana ngebuchwepheshe**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""U.N. nayo yetsemba kutsi itawucedzela kuhlanganisa imali yekusita emave lahlaselwe kushisa kakhulu kwemhlaba kuze akhone kubhekana nemiphumela loko lokuwuletsile. Lemali ingasetjentiselwa tindlu letivimbela tikhukhula, kunakekela emanti kancono, nekwandziswa kwetitjalo.""

It then goes on to say that this money can be used for things like preventing floods, improving water management, and increasing crops. However, the core hope of the UN is to **gather funds** (imali) to address the impacts of climate change and **share technology** to help vulnerable countries.

The other options are too specific. While the money could be used for things like housing and water management, the overall hope of the UN is the combination of funding and technology sharing.
"
Ngukuphu kulokulandzelako lonkungangabalilwa mngu-Albert McCall njengalamanye lokusamele kuvunyelwane ngawo?,"The correct answer is **C: Imitsetfo yekucala (Customs regulations)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Albert Muchanga said, ""We are not yet in agreement on customs procedures and tariffs, but we have enough goodwill to start trading on January 1, 2020."" 
* This directly indicates that customs procedures (imitsetfo yekucala) are an outstanding issue that needs to be resolved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I-Benin itawujuyona i-AFCTA:** The text explicitly says Benin *will* join the AfCFTA.
* **B: Lusuku kuhweba lokungacala ngalo:** The text states the trading will start on January 1, 2020.  While important, this is a date, not a negotiation point.
* **D: Imvume yentsela (Tariffs agreement):** Tariffs are part of customs regulations, so it's a component of the larger issue. However, ""customs regulations"" is a more encompassing and accurate answer based on the passage.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani kuhweba kungacali ngeNhlaba?","The correct answer is **B: Kuneluhlaka lolwanene lwemitsetfo kanye nemvumelwano lekhona.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sisengakavumi mayelana nemitsetfo yemisuka nekukhokha nekuvumelana ngemitselo..."" This directly indicates that disagreements over tariffs and customs procedures are preventing trade from starting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kutawuba Lusuku lekucala bekuyincenye yesikhatsi saseNigeria sekujoyina i-AFCFTA** - While the text mentions Nigeria's preparation, it doesn't connect the delay to a phased implementation.
* **C: Kwavunywa ngukhomishana wetekuhweba netimboni we-AU** - The text says they are *still* negotiating, not that they have reached an agreement.
* **D: Imitsetfo yekucala kanye nemvume yentsengo kuvumelwane ngayo** - This is the opposite of what the text states.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, liphephandzaba lase-Atlanta lasola ngani tikhulu tetemfundvo?","The correct answer is **A: Kuphazamisa umbiko wemtsetfo sisekelo jikelele**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a report highlighting problems with the outcome of the testing. The report showed that the number of test failures increased rapidly, and that the school system saw problems but failed to take action on what was being found. Evidence showed that the scores on the tests were manipulated, and the **top 34 education officials, who were vetted in 2013, were implicated**.""

This indicates that the newspaper accused the top education officials of undermining the integrity of the testing system. Options B, C, and D don't directly reflect the accusation made in the passage. They focus on issues related to school system failure, lack of action on test results, or simply reporting passing scores, none of which were the central accusation against the top education officials.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini loluniketwwe endzimeni, yini lekungakashiwo ku-journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **B: Bufakazi kutsi emaphepha ekuhlolwa alingwe ngabo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a report highlighting issues with the test results. It specifically mentions that the test scores increased rapidly *after* the tests were administered and that school officials were aware of the problems but didn't take action.
*   The passage further states that evidence suggested the test papers were altered.
*   Option B directly reflects this crucial detail that the test papers were potentially falsified.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutfutfukiswa kwemaphuzu ekuhlolwa lokungakatayelekiBufakazi bekutsi emaphepha eluhlolo aphatamiswa** While the passage mentions score inflation and altered papers, option A doesn't explicitly connect the evidence of altered papers to score inflation.
*   **C: 2013 loyinduna yavelonkhe** While the passage mentions the 2013 principal, this isn't the central issue the Journal-Constitution's report highlighted; the focus was on the test results themselves.
*   **D: Tikhalo tekusungula imfundvo yasedolobheni** The passage doesn't provide any information about the founding of the city's school system.

Therefore, the most accurate and important detail the Journal-Constitution *didn't* mention, based on the passage, is the evidence that the test papers were altered."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguluphi lwati lolatiwako mayelana nekubhoma?","The correct answer is **A: linani lekugcina lekulimala (the latest number of casualties)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the most recent information regarding the bombing.** The text states that initial reports suggested 30 casualties, but the confirmed number is uncertain. This implies the question is about the *latest* information available on the number of people injured.
* **Option B** refers to the location of the bombing, which is mentioned but not the core of the question.
* **Option C** discusses investigation, not the immediate information about casualties.
* **Option D** mentions the number of people in government, which isn't directly relevant to the question about the bombing's impact.



Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the information provided is the latest number of casualties."
"Soloku wajoyina iManchester City ngo-2017, mingaki imidlalo layidlalile Jesus?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text states: ""kusukela ngaleso sikhatsi lomdlali waseBrazil sewudlale emahlandla langu-53 kulelicembu lakhe kuyo yonkhe imicudzelwane..."" which translates to ""...since then, the Brazilian player has played 53 matches for the club in all competitions...""
"
Nguliphi licembu lapho Jesus bekathola £27 million ngekuyijoyina?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Palmeiras**.

The passage states: ""NgaJanuwari 2017 Jesus loneminyaka lengu-21 wajoyina licembu leManchester City esuka ecenjini laseBrazili iPalmeiras ngemali lekubikwa kutsi itigidzi letingu-27 temayuro.""  This translates to: ""In January 2017, Jesus, at the age of 21, joined Manchester City from the Brazilian club Palmeiras for a reported fee of £27 million.""
"
ngusiphi sitatimende lesingasilo liciniso mayelana tivakashi tasehhotela?,"The answer is **D: Liningi letivakashi betivela edolobheni lelincwele** (Many of the visitors come from the holy city).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ihostela iwile e-Mecca...Lesakhiwo yaniketa tivakashi letinengi letihamba ngendzaba yenkholo indzawo yekuhlala lebetita titovakashela lidolobha leligcwele ngebusuku be-hajj pilgrimage.""  This means many of the visitors *are* coming from the holy city (Mecca itself, or potentially nearby areas).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tihambeli betise-Mecca lapho tihambela khona** (Pilgrims are where they are going): This is a general statement about pilgrims and doesn't contradict the information in the text.
* **B: Letinye tetivakashi bekungasito takhamuti tendzawo** (Some of the visitors are not from the area): The text clearly states that the majority of visitors are from the United Arab Emirates.  This option suggests some aren't, which doesn't align with the provided information.
* **C: Tivakashi** (Visitors): This is simply a restatement of the subject and isn't a statement that can be proven false.



Therefore, the statement that is *not* necessarily true based on the provided text is that many visitors are coming from the holy city.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende saletilandzelako lesiliciniso?","The correct answer is **D: Liningi letivakashi lihlala eMecca.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Lesakhiwo yaniketa tivakashi letinengi letihamba ngendzaba yenkholo indzawo yekuhlala lebetita titovakashela lidolobha leligcwele ngebusuku be-hajj pilgrimage."" This means many of the guests are staying in Mecca *for* the Hajj pilgrimage.
* **A is incorrect:** The text doesn't state that all guests have already left.
* **B is incorrect:** While many likely will, the text only mentions they are staying in Mecca *for* the Hajj.
* **C is incorrect:** The text mentions they are staying in Mecca *during* the pilgrimage, not the day *before*.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzimeni, kutsi nguluphi lwati mayelana nekuhlangana lokungacaci?","The correct answer is **A: Bukhulu bekushayisana (Magnitude of the collision)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bososayensi batsi kuchuma lokwabangelwa ngulokushayisana kwaba kukhulu kakhulu."" (Scientists say it was caused by an extremely large collision.)  The text focuses on the size/magnitude of the collision as the primary factor being investigated. The other options are either related but not the *primary* concern of the scientists or are irrelevant to the question.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lesadzinga kuncunywa mayelana nekushayisana?","The correct answer is **B: Kutsi masethelayithi bewahamba ngekushesha lokungakanani ngalesikhatsi kushayisana.**

* **The problem states:** ""Bososayensi batsi kuchuma lokwabangelwa ngulokushayisana kwaba kukhulu kakhulu."" (Scientists believe it was caused by a very large collision.)
* **The question asks:** ""Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lesadzinga kuncunywa mayelana nekushayisana?"" (Regarding the weight, what needs to be increased about the collision?)
* **The context implies:**  The scientists are trying to understand the *force* of the collision. Force is directly related to mass and velocity.  Since the mass (1,000 pounds) is already given, the velocity (17,500 miles per hour) is the variable that needs to be considered.  A higher velocity during the collision would increase the force.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngubani lotophatsa kulandzela idodi** (Who caused the impact after the collision) - This is about causality, not the forces involved.
* **C: Kutsi imiphumela yekuhlatiya litulo litowabiwa njani** (How the impact results will be interpreted) - This is about analysis of the results, not what needs to be increased about the collision itself.
* **D: Sikali lekungiso sekuphahlaka** (The scale of the sensor is broken) - This refers to a technical problem with the sensor, not the collision's properties.



Therefore, the collision's speed needs to be considered to better understand the forces involved.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi indzawo Batten lake wayibamba ehlwini lwaseMelika lebantfu labacebe kakhulu?","The correct answer is **C: Yesi-190**.

The question states that Batten was one of 400 people who died from West Nile Virus in the US in 2008. Therefore, his ranking by number of deaths is 190.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lapho Batten ente umnikelo khona?,"The correct answer is **B: Enyuvesi yase-Virginia**.

The passage states: ""Wetfweswa ticu eKolishi Letebuciko Nesayensi yaseNyuvesi yeVirginia nga-1950 futsi bekafaka sandla ekunikeleni kuleso sikolwa."" This directly indicates that Batten made a donation to the University of Virginia.
"
Litsini ligalelo lemtsetfo sivivinya losayinwe umbusi Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuvimbelwa kwekutsengisa noma kwekucashwa kwemidlalo yevidiyo leneludlame kulo lonkhe lase-California.**

Here's why:

The text clearly states the law requires that violent video games sold in California must have a ""18"" rating and be restricted from sale to minors. Failure to comply results in a fine of $1000 per violation. This means the law restricts the *sale* and *rental* of such games, effectively preventing them from being available to children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tinhlawulo temali yalabente lokubi:** This refers to fines, but not the core action of the law.
*   **C: Kuvimbelwa kwekutsengisa noma kwekucashwa kwemidlalo yevidiyo neludlame ngaphandle kwe-California:** The law is specifically for California.
*   **D: Imfuneko Yedecal emidlalweni leneludlame:** While a rating is required, the law isn't just about *having* a rating; it's about restricting sales to minors based on that rating.



"
"Ngekusho kwenzima, ngubani londlulwe ngulokukhulumiwe?","The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nabamcela asho lokutsite, Miller watsi..."" (When they asked him to explain, Miller said...) This clearly indicates that Miller is the one being spoken to and is the one responding to the request for explanation. Therefore, Miller is the one who was ""lonlulwe ngulokukhulumiwe"" (overlooked/missed something because of what was said).
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuliciniso kulokuhlangene nako kwa-Miller ekucileni macala?","The correct answer is **B: Bekangakanaki ngalesikhatsi atilungiselela**.

Here's why:

The passage states Miller said, ""...Mike [Duvall] is talking too much about the case... I wasn't prepared for that..."" This clearly indicates Miller was **not** adequately prepared to discuss the case because Duvall was talking extensively about it. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Duvall wente umbono ku-Miller ngesikhatsi sekulalela emacala:** While Duvall *did* speak, the passage doesn't focus on him making an impression *on* Miller, but rather on Miller's lack of preparedness *due to* Duvall's talkativeness.
* **C: Bantfwana baDuvall lababili bakhuluma kakhulu ngesikhatsi sekulalelwa kwelicala:** The passage refers to Duvall's *children* talking, not Miller.
* **D: Bekayinakisisile indzaba yaDuvall:**  The passage doesn't give us enough information to conclude that Miller didn't care about Duvall's case.  She simply wasn't prepared for the amount of detail Duvall was providing.



"
Ngubani lophakamise kutsi kubuyeketwe ‘Umtsetfo Wemoya Lohlantekile’?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Jack Layton**.

The text states: ""Ndvunankhulu Stephen Harper uvumile kutfumela umtsetfo wahulumende lotsi 'Clean Air Act' ekomidini kuze iwubuyekete, ngaphambi kwekutsi ufundvwe lihlandla lesibili, ngemuva kwemhlangano wemizuzu lengu-25 wangaLesibili nemholi we-NDP Jack Layton e-PMO.

This clearly indicates that Jack Layton requested the review of the Clean Air Act.
"
Ngubani lophikile kutsi “sento semoya lohlobile” besisebentiswa njenge sento sangaphambi kwelukhetfo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndunankhulu**.

The text states: ""Ndvunankhulu Stephen Harper uvumile kutfumela umtsetfo wahulumende lotsi 'Clean Air Act' ekomidini kuze iwubuyekete, ngaphambi kwekutsi ufundvwe lihlandla lesibili, ngemuva kwemhlangano wemizuzu lengu-25 wangaLesibili nemholi we-NDP Jack Layton e-PMO. Layton ucele lushintjo ngesikwelede etintfweni letiphatselene nelushitjo kutemvelo kumhlangano ne-PM, wacela """"kutsi kucedvwe kubhala kabusha"""" Lushintjo kulephathi ngesikwelede setemvelo.""  The paragraph then goes on to discuss Prime Minister John Howard's comments about the Mersey Hospital situation. Therefore, the Prime Minister (Ndvunankhulu) is the one who commented on the ""sento semoya lohlobile"" (the environmental factor) being used as a pre-election tool.
"
Takhi te-cyanuric acid nemelamine takha ini lapho uma tisabela emchameni wakati?,"The correct answer is **C: Emakristali**.

The text states: ""Bacwaningi kulenyuvesi batsi letinhlanganisela letimbili tiyahlangana kuze takhe emakristalu lokungenteka avale tinso."" This translates to: ""Scientists in the university found that the compounds of the ashes combine to form crystals that trap the ash.""
"
Yini indzaba bacwaningi basebentise i-infrared spectroscopy kute bayibone?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwakheka kwe-kristali emchameni wesilwane lesifuywako.**

Here's why:

* **Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)** is used to identify the *chemical composition and structure* of a substance by analyzing how it absorbs infrared light.  It's a technique to determine *what a substance is made of* and *how its molecules are arranged*.
* The question states that the researchers used FTIR to compare the crystals found in the cat's urine to the crystals found in the poisoned animals. They determined the crystals had the *same structure*.
* Options A, C, and D are incorrect because FTIR doesn't directly reveal the ""seeing"" of something with the naked eye, nor does it directly identify the animals themselves or the act of poisoning. It analyzes the chemical structure.



Therefore, FTIR spectroscopy was used to analyze the **structure of the crystals in the cat's urine.**
"
Ngubani lowabita Luna njenge “ndlovukati Yekwecisa”?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels uphawule ngekutsi """"Luna uyacaka njengami...kungenteka ucaka kakhulu yena...ngiyamtsandza futsi ngitomkhanuka...ngiyetsemba usendzaweni lencono lakakhona."""" (Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels noted that """"Luna is fierce like me...she can be very fierce...I love and respect her...I hope she has a better future."""")

And earlier, Tommy Dreamer said: """"Luna bekayiNdlovukazi yekucala Leyendlulele. Umphatsi wami wekala. Luna washona kulobusuku betinyanga letimbili."""" (""Luna was the first Queen of the Jungle. My sister. Luna died two months ago."")

Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who called Luna the ""Queen of the Jungle"".
"
Ngubani lobite Luna ngekutsi “uyahlanya”?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngu-Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels uphawule ngekutsi """"Luna uyacaka njengami...kungenteka ucaka kakhulu yena...ngiyamtsandza futsi ngitomkhanuka...ngiyetsemba usendzaweni lencono lakakhona.""""  The word ""ucaka"" translates to ""cool"" or ""awesome"".  Therefore, Dustin Runnels called Luna ""cool"".
"
Yini lengazange yenteke kulomshayeli lobandzakanyeke engotini?,"The correct answer is **B: Akazange alimate namunye webantfu phakatsi ekhaya (He didn't injure anyone else at home)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngisho noma bekunebantfu labatsatfu kulendlu ngesikhatsi ishayiswa ngulemoto, kute kubo lolimele."" (Even though there were three other people in the house when the car was hit, they were unharmed.)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Walimala inhloko (He was injured in the head)** - This is stated in the text.
*   **C: Wasuswa esibhedlela eCambridge wayiswa ekulesinye eGreat Yarmouth (He was taken from the Cambridge hospital and transferred to another in Great Yarmouth)** - This is also stated in the text.
*   **D: Bestimo letiphuthumako bamsitile bamkhipha emotweni yakhe (Emergency services had to cut him out of the car)** - This is stated in the text.



"
Yini lebeyingagcamanga ngemdlalo weNingizimu Afrika ngesikhatsi semchudzelwano welibhola lembhoco.,"The correct answer is **C: Umdlalo lophuculiwe ekucaleni kwemchudzelwano** (Improved game in the beginning of the tournament).

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Labahamba embili kulomcudzelwano iNingizimu Afrikha icale kahle nayiphumelala kalula nga 26-00 kulabesihlanu iZambia. Babukeka bangakakulungeli kahle kudlala emdlalweni labacudzelene kuwo nabosisi baseningizimu, iNingizimu Afrika itse kuphakamisa lizinga ngesikhatsi lomcudzelwano usachubeka."" This translates to ""The South Africans started well in the tournament and easily won 26-0 against Zambia. They seemed not to be playing well in the competitive matches against southern opponents, and South Africa said they would raise their game as the tournament continues.""

* This directly implies that South Africa *improved* their game as the tournament progressed, rather than starting with a strong performance in *every* match.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kusebentisana kwelicembu lokuhlaba umchele** (Teamwork in tackling the ball) - While tackling is important, the passage focuses more on the overall improvement of the game.
* **B: Likhono lekuphatsa ibhola** (Ability to handle the ball) - The passage mentions handling skills as part of their strengths, but it's not the *key* point about their tournament performance.
* **D: Emakhono ekutivikela** (Defensive skills) - The passage does mention their defense as strong, but again, it's not the central point about their tournament progression.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C**."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, umdlalo waseNingizimu Afrika ucale nini kuba ncono?","The correct answer is **D: Njengoba umcudzelwano uchubeka**.

The text states: ""Lemidlalo icale nga-10:00 ekuseni... bekulilanga lelikahle le-rugby 7. Labahamba embili kulomcudzelwano iNingizimu Afrikha icale kahle nayiphumelala kalula nga 26-00 kulabesihlanu iZambia. Babukeka bangakakulungeli kahle kudlala emdlalweni labacudzelene kuwo nabosisi baseningizimu, iNingizimu Afrika itse kuphakamisa lizinga ngesikhatsi lomcudzelwano usachubeka.""

This indicates that South Africa's performance improved *during* the tournament as it continued. They started well, but South Africa aimed to raise their level as the tournament progressed. Therefore, their best performance happened *as the tournament continued*.
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngusiphi kuletitatimende letilandzelako lesingakhombosi ngalokungiko umnotfo wase-China?","The correct answer is **C: I-China ingagcina ibe ne-GDP lenkhulu kune-United States.**

Here's why:

* **The original text focuses on the *market* growth of China.** It specifically talks about the growth of the market for cars and the overall economic expansion driven by market reforms.
* **Option C discusses GDP (Gross Domestic Product), which is a broader measure of economic output.** While market growth *contributes* to GDP growth, it's not a direct, inherent consequence of market success. The text doesn't state that China *will* have a larger GDP than the US. It only says the car market *could* grow to be larger than the US car market. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umnotfo wase-China ukhule kakhulu kusukela bente tingucuko.** This is true and directly supports the main point of the text.
* **B: I-China inemakhethi lenkhulu yekutfumela timoto kulamanye emave kundlula i-United States.** This is also explicitly stated in the text and supports the main point.
* **D: I-China ayikase itfumele timoto ngaphandle kundlila iJalimane.** This contradicts the text, which states that China *has* surpassed Germany in car exports.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, i-GDP yaseChina ingayindlula nini yase-United State?","The answer is **B: Emkhatsini kwemashumi lamabili emnyaka (Within the next two decades)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ngaphandle kwekutsi ihlale esigabeni semphakatsi, iShayina ikhulise umnotfo wetimakethe... Kwekucala ngca, emnyakeni lophelile iShayina itfumele timoto kulamanye emave kwendlula iJalimane futsi yendlula neMelika yaba ngiyo lenemakethe lehamba phambili kulemboni. Umnotfo waseShayina ungase ube mkhulu kunowaseMelika kungakapheli iminyaka lengamashumi lamabili.""

* **Translation:** ""Outside of staying in the village, China has developed a market economy... Firstly, last year China surpassed Germany and even the United States to become the leading market in that industry. China's market could become larger than that of the United States within the next two decades.""

Therefore, the text explicitly says China's market *could* surpass the US in *within the next two decades*.
"
Huwaphakamisa kutsi emave lasatfutfuka enteni?,"The correct answer is **A: Batsetse tibopho letichilita sigaba sabo sekutfutfuka (They should take responsibility for their share of emissions)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Hu warned China *not* to be asked to take responsibility for the historical emissions of other countries. He emphasized that China shouldn't be held accountable for past emissions that occurred before it had the economic capacity to reduce them.  Therefore, his statement calls for countries to take responsibility for *their own* emissions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gcila ekuphumeni kwemnotho (Slow down economic growth):** Hu's statement doesn't suggest slowing economic growth. He's focusing on responsibility for emissions, not economic policy.
* **C: Bandlulele ngale kwetibopho tabo tamanje (Bear the burden of their current responsibility):**  While related, this isn't the core of his argument. The argument is about the historical context and fairness, not just bearing current responsibility.
* **D: Kugwema indlela lendzala yekungcola (Avoid the path of carbonization):** This is a general principle of climate action, not what Hu specifically advocated for in this context. He was addressing the *who* and *when* of responsibility.



"
Lokungakashiwo ngu-Hu?,"The correct answer is **D: Sibalo sekuncamuka kwekushiswa kwekhabhoni.**

Here's why:

* The passage states Hu focused on China's carbon emission levels and the trajectory of those levels over time. He *didn't* provide a specific number or figure for the amount of carbon emissions.
* The passage mentions he cautioned against placing undue responsibility on China.
* The other options are mentioned in the text:
    * **A: Sisekelo sekusikeka:** The passage talks about the fundamental principle of avoiding early-stage pollution.
    * **B: Seluleko emaveni lasatfutfuka mayelana nekungcola:** Hu offered a warning against excessive blame.
    * **C: Lusuku lapho kushiswa kwekhaboni kutsembakala kutsi kutoncanyulwa khona:**  The passage refers to a period of time (2005) as a benchmark for comparison.

Therefore, the only thing *not* mentioned is a specific number for the amount of carbon emissions.



"
Kunaku lokulandzelako ngukuphi Veerman latsite simo besingasikahle?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Angola**.

The text states: ""I-Angola ijakele ekubhedvukeni kwesimo lesibi kakhulu futsi lesimo sitohlala sisibi kakhulu e-Angola,"" which translates to ""Angola is experiencing a very severe deterioration and the situation has consistently been very bad in Angola.""
"
Ngenca yemshushisi lototsatsa sikhundla saHuhne?,"The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The passage states: ""Huhne usukile esikhundleni futsi lotofakwa esikhundleni sakhe kuKhebinethi nguEd Davey MP."" This translates to ""Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the Cabinet by Ed Davey MP.""
"
Ngubani lotobamba lichaza langcongcoshe wetemabhizinisi ngemuva kwekushushiswa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Lamb**.

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP kulindzeleke kutsi atsatse lomsebenti loshiywe nguDavey wekuba nguLobuke Temabhizinisi.""  This means Norman Lamb will *take over* the role of Business Secretary. Therefore, Lamb is the one who will be filling the role.
"
Yini loku badlali bakhutsata tibukeli kutsi tente ngesikhatsi se-operaye-Camille Saint-Saen?,"The correct answer is **D: Vumela kuphila kwabo kubonwe nguloku lebakutsandzako.**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Labantfu labaphefomako babhema insangu nabasesiteji lokwenta kutsi wonkhe umuntfu lolangekhatsi afise kubhema."" This translates to: ""These performers were possessed by the stage and wanted everyone to believe."" The phrase ""vumela kuphila kwabo kubonwe nguloku lebakutsandzako"" (let their lives be shown as it is) best captures the idea of them fully immersing themselves in the role and allowing their true selves to be seen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bahlanganyele ekusebenteni kwe-cannabis:**  There is no mention of cannabis in the text.
*   **B: Tsatsa luhambo loluya eJapan:**  While the opera is inspired by Japan, the text doesn't say the performers went on a trip there.
*   **C: Hlanganyela nabo esiteji kute badlale:** The text says they were possessed by the stage, not just playing a role.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate interpretation of what the performers did to captivate the audience."
Ngubani locale wabhema ijoyinti ngesikhatsi se-opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Badlali (Performers)**.

The question asks who *performed* at the opera. The text states: ""Labantfu labaphefomako babhema insangu nabasesiteji lokwenta kutsi wonkhe umuntfu lolangekhatsi afise kubhema."" This translates to ""These performers sang on stage to make every person who watches want to believe."" Therefore, the performers (badlali) are the ones who performed at the opera.



"
Nguliphi lelinye ligama le-”spacewalk” lelidlalwe ngu Leonov?,"The correct answer is **C: Umsebenti extravehicular**.

The text explicitly states that Leonov performed an ""extravehicular activity (EVA)"" which is the technical term for a spacewalk. The text then explains that this EVA is what was known as a ""spacewalk.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umsebenti we-Apollo-Soyuz:** This was a later mission that Leonov *led*, not the name of the spacewalk itself.
*   **B: Umjaho we-space:** This is a general term for a spaceflight, not a specific term for a spacewalk.
*   **D: I-Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is Leonov's designation, not the name of the spacewalk.



"
Leonov wahola incenye yeSoviet kumuphi umsebenti?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku-Apollo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Ngemuva kweminyaka lelishumi, wahola iSoviet leyincenye yemsebenti we-Apollo–Soyuz lokhombisa kutsi leSpace Race isiphelile."" which translates to ""After ten years, he headed the Soviet part of the Apollo–Soyuz mission which showed that the Space Race was over.""
"
Ngubani lolemele kulengoti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Gibson**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nayicedza kwenteka lengoti Gibson waphutfunyiswa esibhedlela kodvwa wafa ngekushesha ngemva kwaloko."" (The accident that happened involved a person named Gibson who was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.)
"
Kwentekeni kulabantfu lababandzakanyeke kulengoti?,"The correct answer is **C: Bebamemeta futsi bakhala**.

The text says: ""Bekunebatfwana labebalindze kuwela umgwaco futsi bonkhe bebememeta futsi bekhala."" which translates to ""There were children waiting to enter the garage and they were all screaming and crying."" This describes what happened to the people present, not what happened to the victim (Gibson).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bobabili bafile (Both died):** The text states Gibson died, but doesn't mention the children dying.
*   **B: Munye bekangakalimali, munye ufile (One was injured, one died):** The text doesn't mention anyone being injured.
*   **D: Bobabili balimele (Both were unharmed):** The text clearly states the children were screaming and crying.

The passage states: ""Lomtsetfo wekusebenta kwetintfo utsi tindzawo letinyenti letimnyama tetindzawo tetinkanyeti tihlala endzaweni yetinkanyezi tibe indingilizi, futsi yakhiwa tintfo letincane."" This translates to: ""The law of action states that dark matter concentrations in galactic centers become the scaffolding, and small particles are built.""

Therefore, the scientists hope to see the success of their work in understanding the formation of **small particles** within the Sagittarius galaxy due to the interaction with the Milky Way.



"
Bososayensi bebabukisisa indzaba yakuphi kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **D: I-Sagittarius galaxy kanye neMtsambo Wetinkhanyeti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lomphumela lelicembu beliwufuna ungabangelwa ngemandla lashintjashintjako emkhatsini kwetintfo letimnyama tegalaxy netintfo letimnyama teMilky Way."" and later ""...neMilky Way ifaka emandla kuSagittarius galaxy.""  The passage specifically mentions these two entities as being involved in the described phenomenon."
"Ngalokusekelwe kulendzima, yini lengagcekwa bagcini bemtsetfo?","The correct answer is **C: Bobani labaniketwa tinkontileka tekwakha kabusha**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the investigation is focused on allegations of kickbacks related to reconstruction contracts awarded to those who were watching and not actively involved in the rebuilding efforts in Washington.  Therefore, the focus for law enforcement would be on those who *received* the contracts.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Imali yekusita (Money laundering):** While money laundering might be *part* of the larger investigation, the passage specifically highlights the kickback issue connected to reconstruction contracts.
*   **B: Kweswela kwemzamo wekwakha kabusha (Obstruction of reconstruction efforts):** While related, the core issue being investigated isn't obstruction itself, but the corrupt practices surrounding the contracts.
*   **D: Imali yekwakha kabusha (Reconstruction money):** This is too broad. The investigation isn't about the money itself, but the corrupt dealings associated with distributing it through contracts.



"
Ngubani logceka emakontileka ekwakha kabusha kwemizamo yekusita ye-Hurricane Katrina?,"The correct answer is **D: Labaphakatsi e-washington**.

The passage states: ""Lihlatsi lokubanti ngemitamo yekwakha kabusha igcile ngekuniketa ngetinkontileka tekwakha kabusha kulabo lababukile labangekhetsi eWashington."" This translates to: ""The investigation into corruption was focused on the awarding of reconstruction contracts to those who were watching and not choosing in Washington."" Therefore, the corruption was centered around contracts awarded to people/entities in Washington.
"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, tibani letivela emkhatsini kwe-Stardust titobonakala kuphi kucala?","The correct answer is **B: Enyakatho ye-California**.

The text states: ""Uma lekhebsuli ifika emhlabeni futsi ingene edvwadvwasini ngabo-5 ekuseni (sikhatsi sasemphumalanga), kulindzeleke kutsi yente letibukwako kubantfu baseNyakatfo neCalifornia..."" This indicates the initial sighting will be in Northern California. While it goes on to mention other states, Northern California is the first location mentioned.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, umkhumbi-mkhatsi utocopha umlandvo wakuphi kulokulandzelako?","The correct answer is **A: Kukhanyisa luhla lwesibhakabhaka lolubanti kakhuku**.

The passage states: ""...itobukeka njengenkhanyeti lewako isuka esibhakabhakeni. Leliphilisi litawundlula ngenhla kwelugu laseningizimu neCalifornia bese ikhanyisa sibhakabhaka phakatsi ne-Oregon ichubekele eNevada nase-Idaho iye e-Utah...""

This directly indicates that the spacecraft will be visible as a bright light in the night sky. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Uhlobene njani Dkt Malar Balasubramanian Ku-Saroja Balasubramaniam?,"The correct answer is **C: Make**.

The text states that Dr. Malar Balasubramanian is the daughter of Saroja Balasubramanian.
"
Watfolakala kuphi umtimba waSara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: Eceleni kwemgwaco**.

The text states: ""...watfolakala eBlue Ash, e-Ohio, indzawo lengaba ngemamayela langu-15 enyakatfo yeCincinnati ehleti phansi emhlabatsini eceleni kwemgwaco egcoke sikibha nesikhindi sangasese esesimweni lesibucayi kakhulu semphilo.""

"
Yini letholwe I-eBay?,"The correct answer is **A: Microsoft**.

The text states that eBay has identified a significant profit increase in its business. It then mentions that eBay plans to segment its profit sources and that Skype holds a strong position in regions like China, Western Europe, and Brazil.  Skype is a Microsoft product. Therefore, the profit increase is linked to Microsoft.
"
Yini lefuna kukuzuza i-eBay ngalokutsenga?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwandzela etindzaweni letinsha (Expand into new markets)**.

The question states that eBay is planning to segment its profit streams and focus on markets where Skype has a strong position (China, Western Europe, and Brazil). This directly indicates an intention to expand into new geographical markets.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Hlanganisa imali lengenako (Raise capital)** - While expanding can sometimes require capital, the text doesn't explicitly say that raising capital is the *goal* of the expansion. It's more about market focus.
* **C: Phakamisa iphrofayili yako (Improve your profile)** - This is too vague.  The expansion is about eBay's profile, not necessarily an individual's.
* **D: Kwenelisa baninimasheya abo (Satisfy its shareholders)** -  While expanding can *help* shareholders, it's not the direct *reason* for the geographical focus. It's a potential outcome.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani longazange achumane netiboshwa letisala egcekeni ngemuva kwekulwa?","The correct answer is **A: Labacocisana nabo (The paramedics)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that paramedics were trying to stabilize the injured farmers *before* the situation escalated.
* The passage then describes the police arriving and using tear gas.
* The final paragraph states that the fire was extinguished by the police.
* There is no mention of the paramedics being involved in securing the remaining detainees.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the paramedics are the group who did not interact with the remaining detainees at the end of the incident.

Ngukuphi kwalokulandzelako lokubangekutsi tiboshwa tihlehle kulesiphitsiphitsi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngumlilo (The fire)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a chaotic situation:

* **Injuries and arrests:** Farmers injured and hospitalized, many arrested.
* **Unruly prisoners:** Arrested prisoners remained outside and didn't return to their homes.
* **Fire:** A fire broke out among the prisoners.
* **Police intervention:** Police intervened with riot gear, using tear gas to subdue the prisoners.

The fire is the event that directly triggered the escalation of the situation and the police response. The other options are related but not the *immediate cause* of the prisoners' unrest:

* **A: Tingcoco letiyimphumelelo (Successful protests):** While protests may have led to the arrests, the fire is what escalated things.
* **B: Lisisi lelikhalisa tinyembeti (A scandalous report):** This is a possible consequence, but not the immediate cause.
* **C: Tiboshwa letilimele (The injured prisoners):** The injured prisoners are a factor in the overall situation, but the fire is what caused the immediate crisis.



Therefore, the fire is the event that prompted the police intervention and further unrest, making it the correct answer.

"Ngekwembono wa-Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, yini lekufanele live lase-Iran litikhulule kuko?","The correct answer is **B: Ingucuko yema-Islamic**.

The passage states: ""Utsi loku bekusolo kuyinkhinga kusukela kusengakenteki ingucuko yeMasulumane nga 1979. Utsa lelive kumelwe litikhulule kulenkhinga.""  This directly translates to ""This has been a problem since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Oil should be freed from this problem."" Therefore, Ayatollah Khamenei believes oil should be freed from the **Islamic Revolution** (ingucuko yema-Islamic).



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngubani lowavumela emnotweni wase-Iran?","The correct answer is **B: I-OPEC**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I-OPEC itsi kutfumela oyili kwehlele ezingeni leliphansi kulamashumi lamabili eminyaka kwaba tigidzi letingu-2.8 temphongolo ngelilanga."" This indicates that OPEC is the organization that allowed the oil production to reach that level.

While Ayatollah Khamenei discusses the importance of oil to Iran, and the European Union is involved in the transactions, OPEC is the organization directly responsible for setting oil production quotas."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo incenye yenchubo yekuvota kwaseFrance?,"The correct answer is **B: Bameli labatfunyelwe ngulababekwe esikhundleni**.

Here's why:

The text details the voting process in France, focusing on security measures. It mentions:

*   **Secure ballot boxes:**  Specifically, the issue of empty ballot boxes and unsealed envelopes is addressed.
*   **Voter verification:** The process of confirming voter eligibility is highlighted.
*   **Ballot box sealing and voter signatures:** The act of sealing ballot boxes and voters signing a voting record is described.
*   **Volunteer counting:**  It states that votes are counted by volunteers following specific procedures.

The text *does not* mention the role of elected officials in overseeing or being involved in the voting process. The security measures are designed to prevent tampering, not to involve elected officials directly in the counting or verification. Therefore, option B is the one that is not part of the described voting procedure.

"
Bantfu labavotako babakhombisa kuphi bantfu lababakhetsile?,"The correct answer is **B: Ephepheni leseliphrintiwe ngaphambili**.

The passage states: ""labavotako bafake liphepha leliprintiwe lelishoko kutsi bavotela bani emvilophini."" (voters put a pre-printed ballot paper in the envelope.)
"
Yini leyaholela Allen kutsi acele kutfungatsa ema-Musashi iminyaka lesiphohlongo?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutjala kwakhe imali ekuhloleni elwandle (His investment in ocean exploration)**.

The text states: ""Allen kwabikwa kutsi umcebo wakhe lomningi wawu-investela luhlolo wetelwandle futsi wacala umtamo wekutfola i-Musashi ngenca yesifiso semphilo yonkhe setemphi."" This directly links his investment in ocean exploration to his desire to find the Musashi.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umcebo wakhe (His plan):** While he *had* a plan, the text emphasizes the investment in exploration as the driving force.
* **B: Inshisakalo yakhe ekwenteni imephu yaselwandle (His skill in making sea maps):** The text doesn't mention any mapping skills.
* **D: Inshisakalo yakhe empini (His military skills):** The text makes no mention of any military background.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lena Allen lasebentise kuyo imali yakhe leningi?","The correct answer is **A: Kubuyisela iMusashi**.

The text states that Allen invested heavily in ocean exploration *with the intention of finding the Musashi treasure*. Therefore, the purpose of his investment was to recover the Musashi.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungenteka kuholele etimeni letiyingoti phakatsi nasedvute kwesitjalo?","The correct answer is **B: I-caesiumlenemisebe**.

Here's why:

The text states that the high-speed radiation and iodine were detected originating from the soil. It then connects this to the decaying uranium fuel.  Uranium decays into various elements, and one of the key products of this decay process is **cesium-137**. Cesium-137 is a radioactive isotope that has a long half-life and is a major concern in nuclear accidents.  It's known to contaminate soil and water, posing a significant health risk.

While iodine is mentioned as being present, it's a relatively short-lived isotope and doesn't typically cause long-term contamination like cesium.  The white fog is primarily iodine vapor, but the serious long-term hazard is the cesium contamination.  The uranium itself is the source, but it decays *into* cesium-137.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo lenye yemathiphu ekuphepha laphakamiswe kubahlali bendzawo kulandzela sigameko lesenteke kulesikhungo?,"The correct answer is **C: Gwema kuhogela intutfu lemhlophe**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that authorities advised residents to avoid inhaling the white plume.**  This is a direct safety recommendation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gwema kusebentisa emayunithi emoya:** The passage says residents turned off air conditioners, suggesting this was a safety precaution. So, avoiding them is appropriate.
* **B: Hlala phakatsi:** The passage states residents were advised to stay indoors. This is a direct safety recommendation.
* **D: Gwema kunatsa emanti empompini:** The passage mentions residents stopping using water pumps. This is a direct safety recommendation.

Therefore, the only option *not* mentioned as a direct safety precaution in the passage is to avoid inhaling the white plume.

**In summary, the question asks for the *next* safety tip, and avoiding inhaling the plume is the most logical next step after the actions already mentioned.**
"
"Ngekwa Dtk. Moll, yini lekhatsata kakhulu mayelana ne-XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **C: Linani lebantfu labangandluliselwa ngumuntfu logulako**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngemnyaka munye, umuntfu lonesifo angase atselele bantfu labangu-10 kuya kulabangu-15 lake waba nabo."" (In one year, a person with the disease could infect 10 to 15 people.) This directly addresses the concern of how easily XDR-TB can spread.

While the other options might be related, the passage emphasizes the transmissibility of the disease as a major worry. The fact that it's hospital-acquired (A) or the drug resistance (B) are factors contributing to the concern, but the *number of people it can infect* is the most highlighted point.  The passage also mentions a concerning mortality rate (D), but it's linked to the rapid spread of the infection.



"
Tingaki tigulane letitfole ikontileka lesha leticinisekisiwe kutsi titisebenti tetemphilo?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""Dkt. Moll ucabanga kutsi letinye tiguli tisitfole esibhedlela lesifo, lokungenani lababili bekutisebenti tasesibhedlela."" This translates to: ""Dr. Moll believes that other patients in the hospital contracted the disease, at least two of whom worked in the hospital.""
"
Hlobo muni webuchwephesha lolusebentiswa luhlelo lwe-NextGen?,"The correct answer is **A: Buchwepheshe lobusekelwe kusethelayithi (Satellite-based technology)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Isebentisa buchwephesha lobusekelo besethelayithi ngalokokwehlukile ebuchwephesheni bangesikhatsi lesendlulile..."" (It uses satellite-based technology, unlike outdated technologies...).

Therefore, option A is the most accurate description of the technology used in the NextGen system.
"
Ingabe i-NextGen ibazuzisa njani balawuli bekuphitsitela kwetindiza?,"The correct answer is **A: Imizila yendiza lemifisha**.

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen uses ""advanced satellite-based technology"" to allow air traffic controllers to have ""real-time information."" This real-time information directly enables the creation of more efficient and optimized flight paths (imizila yendiza lemifisha).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Indzawo yendiza lenembe kakhudlwana:** While NextGen *could* indirectly contribute to more efficient airport operations, the primary benefit mentioned is the improved flight paths.
* **C: Kunciphisa kukhishwa kwekhabhoni:** This is a *result* of NextGen (through more efficient flight paths), but not the direct way it benefits air traffic controllers.
* **D: Phethiloli lomncane:**  This is a consequence of reduced emissions, not a direct benefit to air traffic controllers.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengazange igcekwe tatimlandvo i-FBI ngekugcila kuyo?","The correct answer is **A: Kukhulisa lizinga lempumelelo yabo**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Betemlandvo bagceke tinchubo (presumably a government body) was concerned about the FBI using resources excessively to improve its success rate in solving *simple* cases, especially those involving stolen vehicles. The Congress responded by mandating a review of FBI finances and requiring the establishment of a financial watchdog. This implies the primary concern wasn't the *success rate* itself, but the *cost* associated with striving for higher success rates, particularly on less complex cases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kwaba tinsita ebugebengwini lobucatululeka lula:** The passage explicitly mentions the FBI was using resources for *simple* cases, so this is not something they were *not* checking.
*   **C: Kugcila kakhulu etimeni tetitfombe letingcolile:** The passage says the concerns were around stolen vehicles. The specific mention of the ""igcolile tebulili"" suggests a focus on financial crimes, but not necessarily photo evidence.
*   **D: Emacala emoto leyebiwe:** The passage explicitly states stolen vehicle cases were a focus of the concerns.

Therefore, the question asks what the government *didn't* check related to the FBI's concerns. Since the concern was over excessive resources spent to improve success rates, that is what wasn't being properly checked.



"
Sinyatselo semanyala siphocelela i-FBI kutsi yenteni?,"The correct answer is **B: Khulisa lizinga lempumelelo ye-ejensi**

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""Betemlandvo bagceke tinchubo teFBI takadzeni tekusebentisa tintfo netimali kakhulu ekunakeni emacala lalula kuwacatulula, kakhulu emacala etimoto letetjiwe, ngemgomo wekukhulisa lizinga lekuphumelela lalenhlangano."" 

This directly translates to: ""The FBI's budget was significantly increased to enable it to more easily investigate cases, especially those involving stolen vehicles, as part of a directive to increase the success rate of the agency.""

Therefore, the primary goal of the increased funding and the new policy was to **increase the agency's success rate.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abela tinsita letingetiwe emacaleni etimoto letebiwe (Investigate untraceable stolen vehicle cases):** While investigating stolen vehicles is mentioned, it's a *specific example* of the broader goal, not the overall aim.
*   **C: Gcila ebugebengwini lobufanele kuba lula kubucatulula (Avoid legal repercussions by making investigations easier):** The passage doesn't suggest the FBI is trying to avoid legal problems. It's focused on increasing success.
*   **D: Tisebenti letitinikele emacaleni etitfombe telicansi (Provide personnel for license theft cases):** Similar to option A, this is a specific example, not the main objective.



"
Kwentekeni emotini yeticishamlilo lephendvule engotini ye-JAS 39C Grpen? ,"The correct answer is **B: Igicikile**.

The text states: ""Imibiko yemaphephandzaba ibike ngemoto yemlilo **legicikile** ngesikhatsi iya endzaweni lokwenteke kuyo ingoti."" This translates to ""News reports reported a **burning** fire truck on the way to the scene of the incident.""
"
"Kulandzela kushayisa kwe-JAS 39C Gripen, siteshi setindiza besivalelwe ini?","The correct answer is **A: Tindiza tekutsengiselana (Training aircraft)**.

The text states: ""kwavalwa lesikhungo setindiza kundizela temsebenti,"" which translates to ""the training center was closed due to the mission."" Therefore, the training aircraft were likely the ones affected.
"
Brzezinski unikete bani sicondziso ngesikhatsi sengucuko yase-Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Carter**.

The text states: ""...usite Carter ngekubamba tindzaba temave, letifana ne-Camp David Accords, yanga-1978; wenta simo sahlaliseka emkhatsini weMelika neShayina ngasekupheleni kweminyaka yanga-1970; i-Iranian Revolution, leyaletsa simo se-Iran sekutfumba, nga-1979; nekungena kwe-Soviet e-Afghanistan, nga-1979.""  This directly links Brzezinski's actions as NSA to the Iranian Revolution *under President Carter*. Therefore, Carter is the one Brzezinski advised on the situation.
"
Ngubani lobambe sikhundla sekuba ngumeluleki wetekuphatsa Eveni lonkhe kwaze kwaba ngu-1977?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Brzezinski**.

The passage states: ""Wasebenta njenge-NSA, usite Carter..."" This means Brzezinski held the position of NSA *before* Carter.  The question asks who held that position until 1977, and the passage confirms Brzezinski was NSA from 1977-1981.
"
Ngukuphi kulokuladzelako lokungakhombisi ngalokungiko umsebenti waBobek nePartizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **B: Ushaye emagoli lamaningi kunanoma ngumuphi lomunye umdlali**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states Bobek scored 403 goals.** While this is a very high number, the text also says **another player scored more goals than Bobek**. 
* Options A, C, and D are all directly supported by the text: He scored a lot of goals, was voted best player, and played in many games.

Therefore, the statement that he scored more goals than *any other player* contradicts the information provided in the passage.



"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesimayelanne nemlandvo wa-Bokek ne-Partizan Belgrade lesiliciniso?,"The correct answer is **A: Ucale kudlalela i-Partizan nga-1945**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Wabajoyina nga-1945 futsi wahlala kwaze kwaba ngu-1958."" This translates to ""He joined in 1945 and stayed until 1958.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wadlalela i-Zagreb ngaphambi kwe-Partizan Belgrade:** The text only mentions him playing for Partizan Belgrade, not Zagreb before.
* **C: Wadlalela i-Partizan kwadzimate kwaba ngu-1995:** The text says he was voted as the best player in 1995 *after* his time with Partizan, not that he played until 1995.
* **D: Utfole ludvumo ngemuva kwekuvotelwa njengemdlali lovelele we-Partizan:** The text says he was voted *as* the best player, not that he *gained* fame after being voted.

Therefore, the only statement directly supported by the text is that he started playing for Partizan Belgrade in 1945."
Ngekwendzima ngutiphi tici letihlukanisa iHesperonychus ku-Velociraptor?,"The correct answer is **C: Inemtimba lonetinsiba ngalokugcwele (It had fully feathered limbs)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Lenyoni legcwele tinsiba lenengati lefutfumele bekukholelwa kutsi yake yahamba yacondza ngetinyawo tayo letimbili nangetidladla njengeVelociraptor."" (The bird with fully feathered limbs and a warm tail was believed to have walked on its two legs and hunted like a Velociraptor.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inetinyawo letimbili (It had two legs):** While the text mentions it walked on two legs, this is a characteristic shared with Velociraptor and doesn't uniquely distinguish Hesperonychus.
* **B: Eneluzipho lwesibili lolukhundlwana (It had a second life of hunting):**  The text says it *hunted* like a Velociraptor, but doesn't imply a second life cycle.
* **D: Kufutfumala ingati (Its tail was warm):** While the tail being warm is mentioned, it's not a distinguishing feature *between* Hesperonychus and Velociraptor, but rather a characteristic of Hesperonychus itself.

Therefore, the fully feathered limbs are the unique distinguishing feature mentioned in the text.



"
Inchazelo ye”Hesperonychus” iniketwa ngutiphi tici letibonakalako tetinhlobo tetilwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Luzipho(s)** (Claws).

The text states: ""Tidladla tayo tesibili tatitinkhulu, taniketwa ligama lelitsi Hesperonychus lelisho kutsi """"tidladla tasenshonalanga."""" "" This translates to: ""Its most distinctive feature, it was given the name Hesperonychus, which means ""wonderful claw.""

Therefore, the name ""Hesperonychus"" refers to its claws.
"
Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako letiliciniso mayelana nekudubula?,"The best answer is **D: Kudubula kwenteke eBuffalo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lombhancwane boshade e-Texas emnyakeni lophelile wabese uta e-Buffalo kutojabula nebangani netihlobo.  Kudla-dla bekuyimibono yomkhosi, kodwa ummyeni loneminyaka lengu-30, lowatalwa eBuffalo, waba ngulomunye kulabo labane lababulawe kulokudubulana..."" This clearly indicates a shooting incident occurred in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Indvodza nemfati bobabili babuya eTexas:** The passage says they *went* to Buffalo for the celebration, but doesn't say they returned to Texas.
* **B: Bekunebantfu labahlanu labahlukumetekile:** The passage explicitly states four people were shot, not five.
* **C: Lalababili bashade ngemnyaka lodlulile eBuffalo:** While they *were* married last year, the passage doesn't state they got married *in* Buffalo. They went to Buffalo for a celebration.



Therefore, **D** is the only statement directly and accurately supported by the text.



"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lekungiso lesimayelana nendzawo lapho kwenteke khona sigameko sekudubulana?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwenteke emcimbini wekugubha iminyaka eBuffalo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Cishe bangu-100 bantfu labafikile emcimbini, kutohalalisela umnyaka wekucala beshadili labashadikazi labashade ngemnyaka lophelile. Umyeni loneminyaka lengu-30, lowatalwa eBuffalo, waba ngulomunye kulabo labane lababulawe kulokudubulana, kodvwa umfati wakhe akazange alimale. Lombhancwane boshade e-Texas emnyakeni lophelile wabese uta e-Buffalo kutojabula nebangani netihlobo.""

This clearly indicates the event happened at an anniversary celebration in Buffalo.
"
Ngekusho kwendzima bekuyini kukhtsateka kwekucala phakatsi kwetikhulu mayelana ne-Luno?,"The correct answer is **A: Kusweleka kwemtfwalo wamanyolo (Excess weight)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the plane was carrying a maximum weight (120 cubic meters). The concern raised is that the cargo (presumably the ""emcuba"" - cargo) *might* have exceeded that weight, causing the plane to break its silence (presumably engine failure) and causing a scare. The phrase ""ngase uwuchitse lomthwalo"" directly translates to ""might have exceeded that load.""

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Emagagasi nemoya lomkhulu (Wind and air)** While wind and air conditions can impact flight, the primary concern raised in the text is about exceeding the plane's weight limit.
*   **C: Kucitseka kwemafutsa (Engine failure)** The passage suggests the engine *might* have failed due to the excess weight, but it doesn't explicitly state engine failure occurred. The focus is on the potential weight issue.
*   **D: Kulimela lokungenteka kumalunga etisebenti (Failure of essential components)** This is too broad. The passage points to a weight issue, not necessarily a failure of essential components.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngutiphi kuletitatimende letilandzelako letingasilo liciniso mayelana nekuphuka kwe-Luno?","The correct answer is **B: Umkhumbi bowunemafutsa langemamitha langu-100 ngesikhatsi sekuphuka.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Indiza lenaphephela emhlane isindzise bantfu labalishumi nakubuye labasebenta lolimele umane nje waphuka imphumulo."" (The plane crashed, injuring twelve people who were working on the farm, and the plane just broke up.)  It *also* states: ""Umkhumbi longemamitha langu-100 bewusendleleni uyotsatsa umtfwalo wemcuba njengalokutayelekile ngako baphatsi bacala kukhatsateka kutsi lomkhumbi ungase uwuchitse lomthwalo."" (The 100-meter long plane was on its way to disperse fertilizer as planned, but the pilots feared that the plane might have broken up under the weight of the fertilizer.)

* **Option B directly reflects this statement.** The passage explicitly mentions the plane's length (100 meters) *at the time* the pilots feared it might break up.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuphuka kwenteke ngaphambi kwekutsatsa imphahla** (The plane broke up before dispersing the fertilizer) - The passage indicates the plane *was on its way to* disperse the fertilizer, implying the breakup happened *while* doing so, not beforehand.
* **C: Kwetisebenti letilishumi nakubuye, kwalimala munye** (Of the twelve workers, one was injured) - The passage states *twelve* people were injured, not necessarily just one.
* **D: Umkhumbi waphoswa emantini lageletako** (The plane was scattered in the air) - The passage says the plane ""broke up"" which implies fragmentation, but doesn't explicitly say it was scattered *in the air*.

Therefore, **B** is the only option directly supported by the text.
"
Kuiphi lishumi leminyaka lapho i-Algeria yatfola khona imphumelelo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngo-1960s**.

The text states: ""Ngabo-1960 wabuyela emuva e-Algeria eveni lebeselitfole imvume yekutibusa kuze afundzise kucondzisa kudlalwa kwemafilimu."" (In the 1960s he returned to Algeria and obtained permission to teach directing film.) This indicates Algeria achieved a certain level of autonomy or success in the 1960s.
"
Betikuphi tikilini tamabonakudze tingakalungiseleli umcimbi wemngcwabo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kulo lonkhe laseRome**.

Here's why:

* The text states that due to the large number of people, the funeral couldn't accommodate everyone in St. Peter's Square. 
* Therefore, viewing areas were set up in *all* of Rome.
* The text also mentions similar arrangements in various Italian cities and Poland, but the primary focus is on Rome.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.
"
Wentelwe kuphi umcimbi wemgcwabo?,"The correct answer is **C: E-St. Peter Square**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Linani lebantfu labebakhona belilikhulu kakhulu kangangekutsi bekungeke kwenteke kutsi wonkhe umuntfu akhone kungena kulomngcwabo eSt. Peter's Square."" (The number of people present was so large that it was impossible for everyone to enter St. Peter's Square for the funeral.)
"
"Kulandzela kuchuma, ngubani lowalashelwa kulimala lokubi?","The correct answer is **A: Lokungenani bantfu labasihlanu (At least five people)**.

The text states: ""Kute bantfu labasihlanu labebakulendzawo ngesikhatsi salokuchuma balashelwa kwetfuka."" which translates to ""At least five people who were in the house at the time of the fire were rescued.""
"
Ngubani lobike?,"The correct answer is **A: Makhelwane esakhuweni (Neighbors across the way)**.

The text states: ""Sisebenti salenkampane yagesi sitile kulendzawo yengoti ngemuva kwekuba **makhelwane ashaye lucingo wabika ngekuvuta kwagesi**."" (An electrician from the power company went to the scene after **neighbors called to report an electrical fire**.)
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, bangaki bantfu labashone kulokuhlasela?","The correct answer is **C: 5**.

The text states: ""Labashone bekunguNicholas Alden, 25, naZachary Cuddeback, 21...Sikhali sa-Uka sahluleka sibe sikhonjwe enhloko yendvodza yesihlanu.""  This translates to ""The attackers were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21...An Uka knife failed and was lodged in the head of a fifth man."" Therefore, there were a total of 5 people involved (2 attackers + 1 person injured + 1 person killed).
"
Sabani sikhali lesihluleke kudubula ngesikhatsi lesitsite ngesikhatsi sekuhlasela?,"The correct answer is **B: Sa-Uka**.

The text states: ""Sikali sa-Uka sahluleka sibe sikhonjwe enhloko yendvodza yesihlanu."" This translates to ""The Uka rifle failed and was jammed in the head of the fifth man."""
Ngiyiphi yalemidlalo lelandzelako leyavotelwa kutsi isuswe ehlelweni lema-Olympic?,"The answer is **C: I-Baseball**.

The text states: ""Levoti kusafanele ilungiswe yi-IOC emhlanganweni wayo wanga-October eCopenhagen.  I-baseball ne-softball, lekwavotelwa kutsi kuphume Emidlalweni yema-Olimpiki nga-2005."" This translates to ""The vote should be finalized by the IOC in its October meeting in Copenhagen. Baseball and softball, which were voted out of the Olympic Games in 2005.""
"
Nguyiphi Yalemidlalo ldlandzelako levotelwe likomiti lavelonkhe kutsi liwufake kulemidlalo?,"The correct answer is **C: Inyonyana Yebhola lembhoco (Rugby)**.

The text states: ""I-rugby, ngalokukhetsekile inyonyane ye-rugby, negalufa yakhetfwa kunaleminye imidlalo lesihlanu lebeyibalelwa kudlalwa kuma-Olimpiki."" This directly indicates that rugby was chosen.
"
Arthur Guinness ekucaleni wacashisa iSt James’ Gate iminyaka lemingaki?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The passage states: ""Eminyakeni lengu-250 ngemuva kwaloko..."" which directly answers the question.
"
Mayelana netigidzi letiyinkhulungwane temadola letiletfwa nguGuinness ngemnyaka ngamunye?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The passage states: ""...i-Guinness ikhule yaba libhizinisi lemhlaba wonkhe lelenta emabhiliyoni langetulu kwalangu-10 emayuro (US$14.7 wemabhiliyoni) njalo ngemnyaka.""  This means Guinness generates over 10 billion euros *per year*.
"
Mangaki emave e-European Union lakhonjiwe laneligciwane i-H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuhlanu (Five)**.

The text states: ""Live laseFrance lesikhombisa emaveni aseYurophu Lehlangene kutsi lihlaselwe nguleligciwane; lilandzela i-Austria, iJalimane, Slovenia, iBulgaria, iGreece neTaliyane.""  This translates to ""The French live show shows that it has been hit by the virus in European countries; it follows Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy."" Counting those countries, there are five.
"
Likhonjwe kuphi licala lakamuva leligciwane i-H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: I-France**.

The text explicitly states: ""kucinisekisiwe kutsi sibulale lidada lasesigangeni, lelitfolakale ngeMsombuluko emachaphozini lasedvute kwe-Lyon empumalanga yase-France."" (it has been confirmed that the fatal case occurred in a poultry farm in Lyon, eastern France on Monday.)
"
Wagcina nini Haiti kuba nalesifo ngaphambi kwekusakateka lokubangwa masotja ekuthula?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngabo 1800**.

The text states: ""Ngaphambi kwekutsi emabutfo emphi efike, iHaiti beyingakake yahlangabetana netinkinga letihlobene netifo kusukela nga-1800."" (Before the arrival of the peacekeeping troops, Haiti had not encountered disease-related problems since 1800.)
"

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngaphambi kwekutsi emabutfo emphi efike, iHaiti beyingakake yahlangabetana netinkinga letihlobene netifo kusukela nga-1800. I-Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy ibale timfundvo letitimele letiveta kutsi emabutfo aseNepal aMhlabuhlangene lagcina kuthula ngekungati aletsa lesifo eHaiti. Danielle Lantagne, solwati wase-UN wetifo, utse lokubhedvuka kwentiwe bantfu labagcina kutfula. **Imfucuta lesuka enkambu ye-UN yayingakahlantisiswa kahle, lokwabangela kutsi emagciwane angene emseleni wemanti loya Emfuleni i-Artibonite, lokungulomunye walemikhulu e-Haiti.**""
"
Uhlele kwentani hulumende wase-Irish?,"The correct answer is **A: Tigwebo letiniketwa labaphula umtsetfo wetidzakamiva.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...the Irish government emphasizes that placing a blockade is a necessary measure to resolve the situation. The government spokesperson says, 'It is always important that both human life and the enforcement of the law are used quickly.'""  The spokesperson also expresses concern about the risk to human life and the increased violence due to the ""temporary suspension of the blockade.""  This indicates the government is *imposing* a blockade as a measure to stop the violence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kwethula imitsetfo lecinile mayelana nekuvunyelwa kwetidzakamiva** - The passage doesn't mention introducing *new* laws about allowing violence. It talks about a *blockade* to *stop* violence.
* **C: Kunetseteka imitsetfo mayelana nekuvunyelwa kwetidzakamiva** - The passage focuses on a blockade, not existing laws about violence.
* **D: Kubandlulula tidzakamiva** - The passage highlights concerns about increased violence, not the deliberate allowance of it.

Therefore, the government is *implementing/establishing* a blockade to address the violence."
Yini lebeyisemtsetfweni kwesikhashana e-Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Tidzakamiva**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umphatsi wetemphilo wavakalisa kukhatsateka ngako kokubili imphilo yebantfu ngabanye labasitakala ngalokuvunyelwa kwesikhashane kwaletintfo letisekhatsi, nemacala lamayelana netidzakamiva lakehlile solo lolushintjo nyalo-lolungekho emtsetfweni lucalisile.""  This translates to: ""The chaplain expressed concern for both human life and other animals regarding the temporary allowance of this situation, and cases of **increased cruelty** and the irregular changes in the slaughter process are also being taken into account.""

Therefore, the text directly links the ""temporary allowance"" to increased cruelty in the slaughter process.



"
Uphenyelwa ini umsolwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kweba (Theft)**.

Here's why:

The text states the suspect is being investigated for ""ukungena endzaweni lakangakavunyelwa kuyo kunelokulimata imphahla"" which translates to ""entering a place without permission and stealing property"".  ""Kweba"" means theft. The details about the sign are a red herring meant to mislead.
"
"Uma ushintja luphawu, yini langakayenti umsolwa?","The correct answer is **A: Kushintja yinye yetinhlavu tayo** (Changing one of its letters).

The passage explicitly states that the word ""O"" was changed to ""e"". This is a direct alteration of a letter within the word. The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuyihlobisa ngeluphawu lekuthula** (Associating it with a peace sign) - While the peace sign is mentioned, it's not the direct change made to the word.
* **C: Ilimate ngekwemtimba** (Imitating a tree trunk) - This is irrelevant to the change made.
* **D: Sebentisa liseyili kuyilungisa** (Using a stencil to fix it) - This describes *how* the change was made, not *what* the change itself is.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzdlako lobekumfundzisi wesingisi Karno langasolwa ngako?","The best answer is **B: Kutsandzana nemfundzi (Misconduct)**. 

Here's why:

* **B (Misconduct):** The question states Karno watiwa ""kakhulu kodvwa ungumfundzisi wesiNgisi lodidanako...futsi kubikwa kutsi usebentise inkhulumo lengcolile ekilasini."" These are serious breaches of professional conduct for a teacher. The statement from another teacher also points to unprofessional behavior.
* **A (Copyright Infringement):** While he *was* accused of copyright infringement, the question asks about the *greatest* offense. Copyright infringement is presented as *one* accusation, but the unprofessional behavior is emphasized more.
* **C (Unauthorized Printing of Advertisements):** This is a serious issue, but it's framed as a specific act, and doesn't encompass the wider picture of his unprofessional conduct.
* **D (Using Vulgar Language in Class):** This is *part* of the misconduct but is not the complete picture. The accusations go beyond just vulgar language.

Therefore, **Misconduct (B)** best encompasses the overall accusations and the most serious offenses related to Karno's actions.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani longakathunjwa nguRonald Mendoza?","The correct answer is **A: Tihambi letibuka indzawo (Photographer)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bantu labashutha titfombe ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi bashutha indzawo yalamoke losakhulile njengoba bakadzinga indzawo yekuhlala lekahle."" This translates to ""Photographers were shooting the area as they needed a good place to live.""  Rolando Mendoza was involved in an incident involving these photographers.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubaphi labathunjiwe labangakacinisekiswa kutsi bakhululwe ngaphambi kwesikhatsi?","The correct answer is **C: Labatfwebula titfombe (Photographers)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the photographers were initially detained and then released because they were working as Filipino photojournalists.  The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Letivakashi (The tourists):**  While initially involved, the text indicates they were also released.
*   **B: Labakhulile (The adults):** The text doesn't specify that the adults were released.
*   **D: Labantfwana (The children):** The text explicitly mentions children and elderly were among those initially detained and then released *along with the photographers*. The photographers' role as photojournalists is the key reason for their release.

Therefore, the photographers are the group most directly linked to being released based on the reason given in the passage.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lococa imisayino kute asekele kushada ngebulili lobufanako eBrasil?","The correct answer is **A: Bafaki tikhalo (Advocates/Petitioners)**.

The text states: ""Bafaki tikhalo setsemba kutsi batawukoleka sikhalo setigidzi letingu-1.2 kuze basetfule Engcungcutseleni Yelive Lonkhe ngaNovember.""  This translates to ""Advocates hope that they will gather 1.2 million signatures to submit a petition to the National Congress in November.""

Therefore, the advocates/petitioners are trying to overturn the law banning same-sex marriage.
"
Babhikishi batasiniketa bani sicelo sabo?,"The correct answer is **A: Lisontfo lemaRoma iCatholic**.

The text states: ""Lisontfo LamaRoma Katolika ngalokuphindzaphindziwe iphikisane nekuvumela imishado yebantfu lebanebulili lobufanako kulelive."" (The Catholic Church has repeatedly opposed allowing same-sex marriage in this country.)

The rest of the passage discusses the Brazilian National Congress, a law, and a petition, but the initial opposition is attributed to the Catholic Church.
"
"Ngekusho kwa-Armand Versace, yini leyenteka ngaphambi kwekutsi sicuku sicale kusabela esimeni selitulu?","The correct answer is **C: Kwaba nemoya lonemandla (There was a strong wind)**.

The text states: ""Ngemizuzu nje lesihlanu, kucale kuhhusha..."" which translates to ""Just five minutes later, it started to blow..."" This indicates the wind was the initial event that triggered the situation.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lacala laduma (The car crashed):** The text describes a strong wind *before* the car started to spin out of control.
* **B: Siboniso besigijima ngemuva kwemizuzu lemihlanu (A car chase started after five minutes):** While there was a chase that followed, the wind came first.
* **D: Ulahlekelwe umkhondo welilunga lemndeni (He lost the car's direction):**  The text implies the car lost control due to the wind, not disorientation.



"
"Ngekusho kwaVersace, ucale nini umoya lonemandla?","The correct answer is **A: Imizuzu lembalwa ngemuva kwekutsi sicale siboni**.

The text states: ""Ngemizuzu nje lesihlanu, kucale kuhhusha..."" which translates to ""Just five minutes later, it started to hail...""  The following sentence then describes the strong wind and hail that occurred shortly after.
"
"Ngaphambi kwaFred, tingaki tivunguvungu letikhulu letirekhodiwe eMpumalanga ya-35°?","The answer is **A: Akukho (None)**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the number of significant hurricanes recorded at 35°W *before* Fred. The provided text states that Fred is the *third* major hurricane reported at 35°W since its formation. This implies that no other major hurricanes had been reported at that location prior to Fred.

Therefore, the correct answer is that none were recorded before Fred.
"
"Lapho Fred asedvute nsichingi saseCape Verde, bekacondze ngakuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Enshonalanga**.

The question states: ""Siphepho, lebesisendzaweni lechele ngemamayela langaba ngu-645 (1040 km) enshonalanga yesichingi saseCape Verde..."" which translates to ""The storm, located 645 (1040 km) **south** of the Cape Verde Islands..."". Therefore, Fred was south of the Cape Verde Islands when he approached them.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokunesivinini lesisheshako kunetindvuleli tayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-802.11n**.

The question states: ""Litubane lelingu-802.11n likhulu kakhulu kunalelo lelililandzelako lelingu-600Mbit/s."" This directly indicates that 802.11n is faster than the next one in line.  The question also clarifies that 802.11n supports both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.

Therefore, 802.11n is the fastest option listed.
"
Yini ledzingekako kute i-802.11n ibuyele emuva ihambisane ne-802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Umsakato lokabili (Dual-band)**. Here's why:

* **802.11n is a dual-band standard.** This means it supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies. 
* **Backward Compatibility:** To be compatible with older standards like 802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g, 802.11n needs to support these older frequencies.  It can achieve this through its dual-band capability, allowing it to operate on the 2.4 GHz band where 802.11b is also prevalent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sivinini lesishesheko kakhulu (Very high speed):** While 802.11n offers higher speeds than older standards, that doesn't directly dictate backwards compatibility.
* **B: Likhono le-802.11b lekusebenta ku-5.0Ghz (The 802.11b ability to operate on 5.0 GHz):** 802.11b *cannot* operate on the 5 GHz band. It's limited to 2.4 GHz.
* **C: Kuphuma kwe-600Mbit/s (Coming from 600Mbit/s):** The speed of 600 Mbit/s is a characteristic of 802.11n, not the reason it needs to support older standards.

Therefore, the key to 802.11n's backwards compatibility is its dual-band nature.



"
Mingaki imicimbi lapho umhlomuli wendondi yegolide wema-Olympics lobekumele abhukute kuyo imidlalo yemphakatsi?,"The answer is **A: Kuhlanu (Five)**.

The text states that the gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and the 4x100m relay in the Commonwealth Games. That's a total of five events.
"
Kungani lowazuza imedali  yeligolide kuma-Olympics angazange anatse umutsi wetinhlungu takhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Bekakhatsatekile kutsi kutawuphatamisa kulungela kwakhe** (He was worried it would affect his preparation).

Here's why:

* The passage states he wasn't allowed to take painkillers because of his poor health.  The reason given for this restriction is that it would jeopardize his ability to compete. He was worried about the negative consequences on his performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Akakabi nebuhlungu** (He didn't have pain) - The passage clearly states he *did* have pain.
* **B: kumente wativa agula** (He imagined he got sick) - This is not supported by the text.
* **D: Akukavunyelwa kuma-Commonwealth Games** (It wasn't allowed in the Commonwealth Games) - While true, this explains *why* he didn't take painkillers, not *why* he didn't want to.  The underlying reason is the concern about his performance.



"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ingabe yini leyaholela ekudzidzekeni mayelana nesehlakalo sekutamatama kwemhlaba?","The best answer is **A: Kuba khona kwemafu lamnyama (The presence of dark ash)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...we've been seeing dark ash related to the volcano below the fears of a potential eruption. The ash has led to confusion about whether it's a potential explosion or a volcanic eruption...""  This directly links the dark ash to the concern and investigation surrounding the volcanic activity.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Imibiko lebuya e-Icelandic Meteorological Office (Reports from the Icelandic Meteorological Office):** While the office *issued* the warning, the passage highlights the *reason* for the warning - the ash. The reports are a *result* of the ash, not the *cause* of the learning.
* **C: Libalave lavelonkhe lekutamatama kwemhlaba (The entire global volcanic eruption):** The passage focuses *specifically* on the Iceland eruption.  It doesn't mention a global eruption.
* **D: Tehlakalo letibikwe kuletinye tindzawo tase-Iceland (Damage reported in other locations in Iceland):** While damage might be a consequence, the passage emphasizes the ash itself as the key factor prompting the concern and investigation.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kuvela nini kugucuka kwesigaba?","The correct answer is **B: Emahoreni langu-48 landlulile**.

The text states: ""Lihhovisi lase-Iceland lesetimo selitulu futsi alikabiki lutfo ngekutatama kwemhlaba kulendzawo yaseHekla kulama-awa langu-48 landlulile."" (The Icelandic Meteorological Office is issuing a red alert for volcanic ash in the area of Hekla for the past 48 hours.)
"
Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako mayelana neluphenyo le-Chandrayaan-1’s letingasilo liciniso?,"The correct answer is **B: Luphenyo belucuketfwe emathulusi labalulekile**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Futsi ngale kwekutsi beyilayishe ematfuluti lamatsatfu labalulekile esayensi..."" which translates to ""And it also deployed three crucial scientific payloads..."".  This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: I-orbiter letfula luphenyo beyinetisebenti** (The orbiter carrying the probe had functionality): While likely true, the text doesn't explicitly state this. The focus is on the probe's success.
*   **C: Umjovo weluphenyo ube yimpumelelo** (The probe's mission was successful): The text says it *landed* successfully, but the question asks about the *following* analyses.  The success of the landing doesn't automatically guarantee the success of all follow-up analyses.
*   **D: Luphenyo belupentiwe ehlongotsini** (The probe's analysis was published in a journal): The text says the images were presented to scientists, not that the analysis was published.



"
Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako letichaza ngalokungiko luphenyo lwenyanga?,"The correct answer is **B: Kushayiseka kwekufika kube imphumelelo (The arrival of the probe was successful)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the successful impact of the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) on the lunar surface.  The question asks what *next* step in the lunar exploration would be. The success of the impact is the key event that would warrant the next steps.  Therefore, confirming the probe's arrival and successful impact is the logical next step.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Yehla dvutane nesigcobo Enyakatho yeNyanga (Descend to the North Pole of the Moon):** The passage doesn't mention a descent to the North Pole.
* **C: Yakhishwa ku-orbiter lenebentfu (It was deployed with a person):** The MIP was a probe, not a crewed mission.
* **D: Beyitfwele emathulusi lamabili labalulekile (It was equipped with two important instruments):**  The passage mentions the instruments, but not the preparation *before* the impact. The impact itself is the more significant event to follow.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzimeni, ngusiphi silinganiso lesisebentiswa ekugcineni sekuvikela lesifo?","The correct answer is **C: Imitsi yekugomela i-Encephalitis**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...kusakatwe tinkhulungwane tetintfo letikuvikela etimbuzulwaneni kuphindze kufutfwe imitsi lebulala tilokatane."" This translates to ""...thousands of animals that protect against the buzzing insects were released, and insecticide was sprayed to kill them.""  Therefore, insecticide (imitsi yekugomela) is the method being used to prevent the spread of the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sibulala tinambutane (We kill rodents):** While rodent control *might* be part of a broader strategy, it's not the primary method highlighted in the passage.
* **B: Badobi betingulube (Tiger cubs):** Tiger cubs have nothing to do with preventing the spread of the disease.
* **D: Emakhethini etimbuzulwane (In insectariums):** Insectariums are for studying insects, not for disease prevention in humans.



"
Sindlulela njani ebantfwini lesifo?,"The correct answer is **C: Tingulube**.

The text states: ""Tingulube tihlala tinalesifo, nakwenteka imbuzulwane iluma ingulube lenalesifo bese iyesuka iyoluma umuntfu uyawubese uyasitfola ke lesifo."" This translates to ""Lions live with this disease, and it happens that a buzzing insect bites a lion that has this disease and then jumps and infects a person who then contracts the disease.""
"
Kuhluleka kwesigwebo sesibili kungaholela kumuphi umphumela?,"The correct answer is **B: Lilungelo lakusasa letinyonyana tebulili lobufanako**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuhluleka kwalesigwebo sesibili, lesiphakamisa kumiswa kwetinyonyane temmango tebulili lobufanako, kungenta kutsi kuvunyelwe tinyonyane temmango ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi.""

This translates to: ""If the second session fails, which proposes a moratorium on the breeding of identical twin animals, it could lead to the approval of identical twin animals over time.""

Therefore, the failure of the second session (and the proposed moratorium) ultimately *leads to* the eventual approval/acceptance of identical twin animals.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubuyeketwa lokuphutfumako kwe-HJR-3:** The passage says HJR-3 will be *revisited*, not destroyed.
*   **C: Sikhatsi lesiphutfumako semtsetfo:** While the failure is a setback, the passage doesn't explicitly state it leads to a general period of constitutional failure.
*   **D: Kuvinjelwa kwetinyonyana tebulili lobufanako:** The opposite is true. The second session *proposed* a moratorium (a temporary ban), but failure of that session ultimately *could* lead to approval.



"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, sisuswe nini sigwebo sesibili?","The correct answer is **C: Ngemsombuluko**

The text states: ""Lushintjo lwentiwe ngekwemtsetfo ngesikhatsi kususwa umusho wesibili kwekucala ususwa yi-House of Representatives futsi wendluliselwa ngendlela lefanako yi-Senate ngeMsombuluko."" This translates to ""The change was made during the legislative process when the second reading of the first motion was removed from the House of Representatives and passed in the same way by the Senate on Monday.""
"
Aputjutelwe kubani “emaphepha asePanama”?,"The correct answer is **A: Inkampani yase-Massachusetts Fonseca**.

The text states: ""Emaphepha ePanama ligama lelisentjentiswa nakushiwo tincwadzi temtsetfo tasePanama Mossack Fonseca..."" This directly identifies Mossack Fonseca as ""emaphepha asePanama.""
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, Ngubani lowatse batindzaba baseBritish bekaphetse tinkampani letiningi letisebentiselwa kufihla Umcebo?","The correct answer is **C: I-Deutsche Bank**.

The text states: ""Liphephandzaba laseBritish i-The Guirdian lisikisele kutsi Libhange leDeutsche lilawulwe cishe nguyinye kuletintsatfu tetinkapane teShell letingu 1200 letisentjentiselwe kwenta loku."" This directly indicates that the Deutsche Bank was involved with a large number of Shell companies used for tax evasion.
"
Ngutiphi tingoti tetindiza kuleti letilandzelako letife kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Indiza iphahlateke endlelini iya e-Armenia isuka e-Iran**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kucaleni kwaleli viki, indizamshini yemaphoyisa lewile ibulale bantfu labantsatfu yalimata labatsatfu ngetulu kwalaba."" This refers to a police helicopter incident.

Then it states: ""Kenyanga leendlulile i-Iran ibe nengoti yendiza lembi kakhulu ngesikhatsi indiza lebeyiya e-Armenia iwa kufe bagibeli labangu-168."" This directly mentions a plane crash *on its way to Armenia*.

Option A accurately reflects this information.  The other options are either incorrect based on the provided text or describe events that weren't specifically detailed as the *most likely* consequence.
"
Ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungasiso sizatfu sebunyenti betingoti temoya letenteka e-Iran?,"The answer is **B: Kusweleka kwesabelomali lesivumela kutsengwa kwetindiza letisha.**

Here's why:

The text highlights a series of air safety issues in Iran: poor maintenance, outdated planes, and accidents. The question asks what the *next* likely issue will be. The text mentions that Iran has been forced to buy older planes due to international sanctions limiting access to newer aircraft. This suggests a continuation of the problem of aging and potentially unsafe aircraft.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Indiza lendzala yetindiza temphakatsi netetimpi:** While this is a possibility, the text already discusses aging planes. It doesn't necessarily predict a new type of plane accident.
*   **C: Luswinyo loluvimbela kutsengwa kwetindiza letisha:** The text says sanctions *force* Iran to buy older planes. Sanctions aren't preventing the purchase, they are dictating what can be purchased.
*   **D: Ingcogco yetindiza letinganakekelwa kahle:** The text explicitly states poor maintenance is a problem. It doesn't suggest that the *next* problem will be a lack of maintenance, but rather the consequence of having older, potentially poorly maintained planes.

Therefore, the logical next issue based on the information given is the continued reliance on older, potentially unsafe aircraft due to sanctions.



"
Nguyiphi kuletilandzelako lengakafakwa embikweni weLicembu Lekufundza lase-Iraq?,"The correct answer is **A: Kugcekwa kwenchubomgomo yamanje**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on future actions and recommendations.** The report outlines what *should* be done to resolve the conflict and prevent future problems.
* **Option A, ""Kugcekwa kwenchubomgomo yamanje"" (Checking the current agreement),** is not directly related to the report's recommendations for the future. The report is about *how to move forward*, not about *assessing the current state of affairs*.
* **Options B, C, and D are all directly mentioned or implied in the passage.** The report discusses securing borders, protecting Iraqi civilians, and the US role in the conflict.



Therefore, checking the *current* agreement is the least relevant point to include in a report focused on future recommendations.



"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakaphisiswana ngako Licembu Lekufundza lase-Iraq embikweni wayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kutsi kumemetelwe siciniseko sekumisa ludlame lolukhulako**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the report emphasizes the need to ""ensure that the violence in Iraq ends, and the large-scale bloodshed and the sword cease.""  This directly aligns with option A.

The other options are also mentioned in the report but aren't presented as the primary or immediate focus for *ensuring the end of violence*.

*   **B: Lushintjo lwendlela lolusheshako** (A change in the pace): While a change in pace is desired, the report prioritizes stopping the violence itself.
*   **C: Kusetjentiswa kwenkhulomomphikiswano levulekile** (The use of open dialogue): Dialogue is mentioned as a component of the solution but not as the core element for stopping violence.
*   **D: Kusungulwa kweluhlelo lolusha lemancusa** (The launch of a new security program): A new security program is mentioned, but again, the report highlights ending the violence as the initial priority.



"
"Ngekusho kwemaphoyisa, ngubani lobekabonwa njengemuntfu longakwesekudla waseProvenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Ngu-Lo Piccolo**.

The text states: ""Emaphoyisa atsi Lo Piccolo abenesandla lesikhulu kuloku ngesizatfu sekutsi abesedvutane naProvenzano..."" which translates to ""The police said Lo Piccolo had a major role in that, as he was allied with Provenzano...""
"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulolwati loluniketwe endzimeni, yini imbangela yekufa kwa-Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Wabulawa empini lebeyichutjwa iRiina**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the mafia bosses, particularly Provenzano, were trying to control the situation and prevent the exposure of their power. It mentions that Riina, a key figure in the mafia, was responsible for the murders of Falcone and Borsellino in 1992. While the passage doesn't explicitly state Riina ordered the assassination, the context strongly implies this as the reason for Falcone's death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wabulawa maphoyisa:** The passage doesn't suggest the police were responsible for Falcone's death. It points to the mafia's actions.
* **C: Lo Piccolo wayalwa kutsi ambulale:** The passage says Lo Piccolo had significant influence and was involved in conflicts with Provenzano, but it doesn't state he was ordered to kill Falcone.
* **D: Wabulawa nguPaolo Borsellino labekasebenta naye bu-Mafia:**  This is contradictory. Borsellino was a police officer fighting against the mafia, not working with them.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasi ngulenye yetindondo ta-Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **B: Sihlalo wekomiti le-All Japan Judo Federation**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kanye nalowake waba sihlabani kuma-Olimpiki neseMhlaba wonkhe, Saito bekangusihlalo welikomiti le-All Japan Judo Federation ngesikhatsi lafa ngaso."" (And he was also an Olympian and World Champion, Saito was the chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation committee at the time of his death.)

While he was also a two-time World Champion and Olympian, the question asks about *the next* thing mentioned in the text *after* his Olympic and World Championship achievements.  Being chairman of the federation is the next thing mentioned.
"
Wakwati kuphi lwasaki kugwema kutsatsa tifungo?,"The correct answer is **B: E-Nepal**.

The text states: ""Wabalekela umshado eNepal futsi waboshwa eNdiya."" This translates to: ""He fled a wedding in Nepal and was arrested in India."" Therefore, he evaded marriage in Nepal.
"
Ngubani lohlasele lwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Inja**.

The passage explicitly states: ""wahlaselwa yinja lenelulaka eTibet"" which translates to ""was attacked by a fierce dog in Tibet.""
"
Wawucedza nini Alonso umncintiswano wakhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngaphambi kwekutsi Schumacher acedze umncintiswano wakhe.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher ucedze umjaho wakhe kungasikudzala emuva kwa-Alonso, ngenca yekumiswa tikhatsi letimbalwa emcintiswaneni."" This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher celebrated his victory which could have put him behind Alonso, due to several time penalties in the race.""

This clearly indicates that Alonso was ahead of Schumacher *before* Schumacher's penalties. Therefore, Alonso was leading *before* Schumacher's victory was decided.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngaphambi kwekutsi Schumacher alimate lisondvo lakhe laphambili:** While Schumacher's spin happened, the question asks *when* Alonso was leading, not about the timing of Schumacher's incident.
*   **B: Fisichella wahluleka kulawula imoto yakhe:** Fisichella's incident is irrelevant to when Alonso was leading.
*   **D: Ngaphambi kwekuhola:** The text indicates Alonso *was* leading, so this option is incorrect."
Yini lebangele Schumacher kutsi asheshise kucedza umncintiswano wakhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Kulimala kwelisondvo lokubangelwe nguFisichella**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...Michael Schumacher ucedze umjaho wakhe kungasikudzala emuva kwa-Alonso, ngenca yekumiswa tikhatsi letimbalwa emcintiswaneni."" ( ...Michael Schumacher had to retire from the race, possibly because of the several time penalties in the competition.)
* It further explains: ""Giancarlo Fisichella utse asuka nje, angakahambi nalokuyaphi wehluleka kulawula imoto yakhe, waphuma kanjalo kulomcudzelwano."" (Giancarlo Fisichella just pulled out, couldn't go anywhere after failing to control his car, and that's how he left the race.)
* The key connection is that Fisichella's failure to control his car *caused* the time penalties that ultimately forced Schumacher to retire.  The text implies the penalties were related to the incident with Fisichella.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uhluleke kulawula imoto yakhe (Failed to control his car):**  While Fisichella failed to control his car, the text doesn't directly state that Schumacher failed to control his car.
* **B: Kugcundzana na-Alonso (Collided with Alonso):** The text doesn't mention Schumacher colliding with Alonso.
* **D: Kulimala kwekumiswa kwemoto (Car time penalties):** Time penalties are a *result* of the incident, not the primary *cause* of Schumacher retiring. The text implies the incident with Fisichella *led* to the penalties.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngumsebenti wabani kubeka ibheyili kulababoshiwe?","The correct answer is **A: Liphoyisa lelibophako (The police)**.

The text states: ""Loseligunyeni ubeke ibheyili, uma iniketwa, futsi wenta emacala lafakwe ngemaphoyisa labophanako.""  This translates to ""The police will set bail, if posted, and will file the cases with the police that they have investigated.""

Therefore, the police are responsible for setting bail.



"
"Ngekusho kwemyalo wekuvinjelwa kwesikhashane lekukhulunywa ngawo kulendzima, yini lekumele tiboshwa tivunyelwe kuba nako uma kumele tigcinwe sikhatsi lesingetulu kwema-awa langu-24?","The correct answer is **A: Ibheyili**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Loseligunyeni ubeke ibheyili, uma iniketwa, futsi wenta emacala lafakwe ngemaphoyisa labophanako."" This translates to: ""Bail can be set by the prosecutor, if granted, and the cases filed by the police and the prosecutor.""  This directly indicates that bail is something that can be considered when someone is detained for longer than 24 hours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umhlangano neliphoyisa lelibophako (Meeting with the police and prosecutor):** While meetings *might* occur, the text doesn't explicitly say this is *required* for release on bail.
* **C: Emacala lasemtsetfweni lakhishwe lijaji Glynn (Cases from the warrant were issued by Judge Glynn):** This describes the warrant itself, not something that would allow for release after 24 hours.
* **D: Kulalelwa (Hearing):** The text mentions the right to a hearing, but it doesn't say a hearing is *required* to be released on bail after 24 hours.  The bail itself is the key element.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi sizatfu lesingasetjentiswanga kuze kuchazwe kutsi kungani lolukhetfo lukhanselwe?","The correct answer is **B: Kushayisana nemtsetfo sisekelo** (Violating fundamental principles of the constitution).

Here's why:

The text states that the election was cancelled *because* it violated the fundamental principles of the Afghan constitution.  The text explicitly mentions the cancellation is due to a violation of constitutional principles and the subsequent conflict with the initial statement.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Tingoti tekuphepha** (Security concerns): While security might have been a *factor* in the overall situation, the core reason for cancellation is stated as a constitutional violation.
* **C: Tindleko letisetulu** (Fraudulent actions): The text doesn't explicitly mention fraudulent actions as the reason.
* **D: Kungacaci kahle kwemtsetfo sisekelo** (Unclear understanding of the fundamental principles of the constitution): The text states that the ""bosomachinga batsi batfole incazelo leyanele"" (the majority didn't have a sufficient understanding) *contributed* to the problem, but it wasn't the direct reason for the cancellation.  The problem was the *violation* itself, regardless of understanding.



Therefore, the best and most direct answer is **B**.



"
Kungani emancusa agcina atsatse lukhetfo njengalolungadzingeki?,"The correct answer is **A: Luphambene nemtsetfo sisekelo (Against the basic constitution)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Loku kungcubutana nembiko lokhishwe ekucaleni, lotsite kukhansela lomncintiswano kuphambene nemtsetfosisekelo."" This translates to ""This is in connection with the report issued earlier, it seems to cancel the competition against the basic constitution."" Therefore, the election was cancelled because it violated the fundamental law of Afghanistan.
"
Ngubani losita i-FATA ngetindzaba temtsetfo?,"The correct answer is **A: Hulumende wase-Pakistan**.

The text states: ""Mengameli wasePakistani ubeke """"Bantfu labatammelela Kutepolitiki"""" kuze babuse i-FATA..."" This indicates the Pakistani government took control of the FATA region.
"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lamayelana ne-”Mancusa Etepoliliti” e-FATA langesilo liciniso?,"The correct answer is **A: Aniketa lusito lwetemtsetfo (They administer a constitutional mandate)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that the ""Bantfu labatammelela Kutepolitiki"" (Political Agents) were appointed by the Pakistani President to govern the FATA. More importantly, it explicitly says they were tasked with ""kuniketa hulumende"" (administering the government) and that their duties included dealing with the complexities and failures outlined in Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.  This indicates they operate within a framework of constitutional authority.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Akhetfwa ngumengameli wase-Pakistan (They are not appointed by the President of Pakistan)** - The text *states* they were appointed by the President.
*   **C: Alandzela umtsetfo sisekelo wase-Pakistan (They follow the Pakistani constitution)** - While they *do* operate under the constitution, the key point is their role is to *administer* a mandate *within* the constitution. The question asks about their function, not whether they are bound by the constitution. Option A is more descriptive of their purpose.
*   **D: Anemandla laphelele ekulawula tindzawo letitsite (They have complete power to control the territories)** - The text mentions ""kuniketa hulumende loko lokudzingeka"" (administering the government, including complexities and failures). This suggests their power is constrained, not complete.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate description of the ""Mancusa Etepoliliti"" in FATA based on the provided text.



"
Ngumuphi umklomelo Emma Stone lanconyelwa wona?,"The correct answer is **C: Umlingisi Lohamba Embili**.

The text states that Emma Stone was nominated for ""Best Actress"" for ""La La Land"" alongside Ryan Gosling.
"
Ngumuphi umklomelo lemuvi lengazange inconyelwe wona?,"The correct answer is **C: Kudidiyelwa Kwemsindvo Lokuhamba Embili**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""Kudidiyelwa Kwemsindvo Lokuhamba Embili"" (Sound Mixing) was *not* among the categories where the film was nominated. The text lists all the categories where it *was* nominated.
"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokwachubeka kusebenta ngemuva kwekutamatama kwemhlaba?,"The correct answer is **C: Yonkhe imisebenti yakaloliwe (All controlled operations)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what continues to operate *after* the earthquake. The text states:

*   The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant is operating normally.
*   Units 1 and 2 of the Shikama nuclear power plant are shut down due to damage.
*   There are gas shortages in many homes and disruptions to transportation.
*   The Hokuriku and Ishikawa Tsunami Evacuation Centers are closed.

The most logical continuation of operations *after* these events would be the continued execution of controlled operations.  While the Niigata plant is operating normally, and the evacuation centers are closed, the broader context is one of disruption and recovery. Therefore, ""all controlled operations"" is the most encompassing and accurate answer. The Hokuriku plant is operating normally (A) but the question implies what's happening *after* the initial earthquake damage. Option B is incorrect because the evacuation center is closed, not operating. Option D is incorrect because the Niigata plant is operating normally, which is already stated.

"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokwalimala kulokutamatama kwemhlaba?","The correct answer is **A: Lamanye emakhaya (Other homes)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kubikwa kutsi emakhaya lengu-9400 kulesigodzi ete emanti futsi lokungenani emakhaya langu-100 akanaye gesi"" which translates to ""It is reported that 9400 homes in the prefecture and at least 100 homes are without gas."" This refers to damage to homes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imishini yekuhlola lemibili eplantini yaseShika (Two inspection machines at the Shika plant):** The text mentions the reactors at Shika are shut down, but doesn't say anything about damage to inspection machines.
* **C: Leminye imigwaco (Other infrastructure):** While the text mentions disrupted train services, the primary focus on the immediate aftermath and the question's direct ask is regarding homes.
* **D: Sikhumulo setindiza saseNoto (Noto thunderstorm shelter):** The text mentions the Noto thunderstorm shelter is closed, but doesn't say anything about damage *to* the shelter itself.

Therefore, ""Lamanye emakhaya"" is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi lokungakafakwa kuletimphepha?","The correct answer is **C: Kuba khona kwembutfo wetemphi esigodzini (The presence of a military force in the territory)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Israel wants to maintain a military presence in the territory for ten more years, and the PA has agreed to this for five years. This points to the military presence as a point of contention and something that could be a barrier to a peaceful resolution.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Likusasa leJerusalema (The future of Jerusalem):** While Jerusalem is a critical issue, the text focuses more directly on the military presence.
*   **B: Imbangela yemphi yanga-1967 (The cause of the 1967 war):** The war is mentioned as the basis for the Palestinian claim, but the current issue is about how to move forward *from* that point.
*   **D: Kubangwa kwemincele (The creation of territories):** The text mentions the creation of territories but the focus is on the disagreements around control and military presence within those territories.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungasiyo lenye yetintfo letifunwa yiPalestine?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuba khona lokuchubekako kwembuto wetemphi eSigodzini SaseJordan.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the Palestinian claim includes the issue of the ""important settlements on both sides,"" and specifically mentions the Jordan Valley.  While the passage does mention Israeli security forces and a potential agreement on their presence in the Jordan Valley for five years, it *doesn't* explicitly state that Palestinian claims *include* the establishment of settlements in Jerusalem.  The other options are directly mentioned as part of Palestine's demands:

*   **A: Imincele lesekelwe etimeni tangembi kwemphi** (Settlements based on military occupation) - The passage mentions settlements as part of the issue.
*   **C: Timphendvulo letimayelana nelikusasa leJerusalema** (Answers regarding the future of Jerusalem) - The passage mentions Jerusalem as a key element of the claim.
*   **D: Kuba khona kwembutfo wetemphi iminyaka lesihlanu eSigodzini SaseJordan** (Israeli military presence for five years in the Jordan Valley) - The passage explicitly mentions this as part of a potential agreement.



Therefore, the only option that isn't directly supported as part of Palestine's core demands in the provided text is the establishment of settlements in Jerusalem.



"
Ma uwufundzele kuliphi live umtsetfo?,"The correct answer is **A: E-United States of America**.

The text states: ""Ma wafundza eNew York University naseSikolweni Tetemtsetfo iHarvard futsi wake waba """"nelikhadi leliluhlata"""" lekuhlala eMelika sikhatsi lesigcwele."" This translates to ""Ma studied at New York University and Harvard Law School and became a ""golden ticket"" to living in America full-time."" Therefore, he studied in the United States.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kumelela liphi live lokwasita Ma kutsi aphumelele lukhetfo?","The correct answer is **A: E-United States of America**.

The text explicitly states that Ma ""waba 'nelikhadi leliluhlata' lekuhlala eMelika sikhatsi lesigcwele,"" which translates to ""became a 'golden key' to living in America full-time.""  This directly indicates that his success in the election was largely due to his strong ties and experience in the United States. The text also mentions he studied at New York University and Harvard Law School, further solidifying his connection to the US.
"
"Njengobe kushiwo kulesicephu, Carolyn Wilson bekasebentela bani ngembi kwekutsi ahambe edolobheni?","The correct answer is **C: I-OHA**.

The text states: ""Ngokubanjwa umhlangano... imindeni leminyenti yabona kutsi Carolyn Wilson **wase-OHA** bekantjontje imali yabo futsi wabaleka kulelidolobha."" (After a meeting was held... the families realized that Carolyn Wilson **from OHA** had embezzled their money and run away from the city.)
"
"Njengobe sekusele imijako lemine kulesizini, ngubani losesigabeni sesine kuloMcudzelwane Webashayeli?","The correct answer is **A: NguHamlin**.

The passage states: ""Ngelihlandla lesitsatfu, Hamlin usemuva ngemaphuzu langemashumi lamabili, kodvwa uphambili ngalasihlanu kuBowyer."" This means Hamlin is in third place.
"
"Kulandzela umcudzelwane lokukhulunye ngawo kulesicephu, Kahne unemaphuzu lamangaki kuloMcudzelwane Webashayeli?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""Kahne naTruex, Jr. basendzaweni yesihlanu neyesitfupha ngekulandzelana ngemaphuzu langu-2,220 nalangu-2,207."" This means Kahne has 2,220 points.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukangakhi bantfu babona emateja lawa esibhakabhakeni futsi kamuva abonakala kutsi avela ku-Mars?","The correct answer is **C: Tikhatsi letilishumi nesihlanu**.

The passage states: ""Lamanye alamatje lokumatima kutsi uwatfole Emhlabeni, atsengiswa nga-US$11,000 to $22,500 li-awunsi, lokuyimali leyendlula cishe ngetikhatsi letilishumi itsengo yeligolide.""

This translates to: ""Other meteorites found on Earth were sold for US$11,000 to $22,500 per ounce, which is almost ten times the price of gold.""

Therefore, the answer is **ten times** which is also written as **tikhatsi letilishumi nesihlanu** in the provided options.
"
"Njengobe kushiwo esiceshini, ngukuphi lokuliciniso ngematje latfolakele kutsi avela ku-Mars?","The correct answer is **D: Kunalangu-34 awo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kulamatje lati-24,000 lekutsiwa ngema-meteorotes latiwako lawela emhlabeni, angema-34 kuphela lokwacinisekiswa kutsi avela kulenye iplanethi."" (Of the 24,000 meteorites that fall to Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to come from another planet.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Onkhe atfolakele nga-July ngesikhatsi kubukwa ematje lawa esibhakabhabhini** - While 15 meteorites were seen in July, not all 34 confirmed Martian meteorites were seen then.
* **B: Kunalangu-24,000 awo** -  The passage states there are 24,000 meteorites *total*, but only 34 are confirmed Martian meteorites.
* **C: Angabita imali lengu-$11,000 kwendlula ligolide** - While the price of Martian meteorites is high, the passage compares it to gold, not a specific dollar amount exceeding $11,000.



"
Schumacher uwutsetse nini umhlalaphansi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngemuva kwekuphumelela kwakhe umcudzelwane wesikhombisa**.

The text states: ""Schumacher lowatsatsa umhlalaphansi nga-2006 ngemuva kwekuphumelela umcudzelwano weFormula 1..."" This directly translates to ""Schumacher retired in 2006 after succeeding in the Formula 1 championship...""
"
Walimala nini Massa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngesikhatsi se-Grand Prix**.

The text states: ""Massa utawuhlala yonkhe isizini ya-2009. Massa utfole kulimala enhloko emuva kwekushayisa nakuchubeka i-2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""  This directly indicates that Massa was injured *during* the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, loluhlelo lutayitsintsa njani i-AOL?","The best answer is **C: Linani lababantfu labasebentisa i-AOL litawulingana nelebantfu labasebentisa i-Yahoo ne-Microsoft.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the combined user base of Yahoo and Microsoft *already* competes with AOL's user base.
* The question asks how the trend will *affect* AOL.  If the trend continues, AOL's user base will likely become equal to or even smaller than the combined user base of its competitors.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Linani lebantfu labasebentisa i-AOL kungenteka likhule:** The passage suggests the opposite, that AOL is losing ground.
* **B: I-AOL kutawuba ngiyo kuphela inkampani letfutfukise imakethe ye-IM:** The passage implies other companies (Yahoo, Microsoft) are also playing a significant role in market development.
* **D: I-AOL angeke iphindze isetjentiswe eMelika:** This is too extreme. The passage doesn't state that AOL will disappear completely, just that its dominance is being challenged.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungase kucephele ngemuva kwaloluhlelo lolusha?,"The correct answer is **A: Kutfutfukiswa lokwandzako kwe-inthanethi eMelika (The growth of the internet in America)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL's dominance in the IM market was tied to the overall growth of the internet in America.  As the internet grew, so did AOL's user base and influence. The passage implies that the decline of AOL's IM market is linked to the broader shift and evolution of the internet itself. The rise of competitors like Yahoo and Microsoft is a *result* of that internet growth and increased competition, not the primary underlying factor.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Labasebentisa imakethe ye-IM (IM Market Users):**  While the number of IM users is changing, it's not the *underlying cause* of AOL's decline. The change in user numbers is a *consequence* of other factors.
* **C: Inkhululeko ye-AOL yekutfutfukisa imakethe ngelitubane layo (AOL's freedom to develop markets with its longevity):** AOL's longevity *contributed* to its past success, but doesn't explain its current decline. Longevity doesn't guarantee continued dominance in a changing market.
* **D: Kuhlangana kwe-Yahoo ne-Microsoft (The merger of Yahoo and Microsoft):** While the merger created stronger competitors, it's not the primary driver of AOL's decline. It's a *factor* in the increased competition, but the underlying driver is the changing internet landscape.



Therefore, the growth of the internet in America is the fundamental context in which AOL's IM market has declined.



"
Bangakhi bantfu labafa kulokuhlasela labebangasiwo emaphoyisa?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The text states the attack killed ""emaphoyisa lamabili yalimata bantfu labangetulu kwemashumi lamabili"" which translates to ""two police officers and killed more than twenty civilians.""  Therefore, the number of civilians killed is more than 20, and we are looking for the number of people who were *not* police officers who died. The question asks for those *not* police, so we should exclude the 2 officers.  Therefore, it must be the number of civilians who were killed. The text says ""more than 20,"" but the closest option representing a number of civilians killed, excluding the police officers, is 19. The phrase ""more than twenty"" suggests it could be 20 or higher, but 19 is the closest and most logical answer given the available choices.

"
Ngubani lobike umsolwa kulokuhlasela?,"The correct answer is **A: Emaphoyisa (The police)**.

The text states: ""Emaphoyisa atsi asola kutsi libutfo leDaesh (ISIL) leli lelihlasele."" This translates to ""The police said that the Daesh (ISIL) organization is responsible for this attack.""
"
"Ngesizatfu sekutsi i-Florida yatiswa njengendzawo lephumelelako, yini leyahlonyeliswa Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Tonkhe tihambeli tembuso**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Romney won *all* of Florida's 27 electoral votes. It also mentions he received 46% of the popular vote and Newt Gingrich received 32%.  The key is that winning all of Florida's electoral votes is what made Florida a successful state for Romney and ultimately propelled him to be considered a strong contender to lead the Republican party. Therefore, he benefited from *all* of the electoral outcomes in Florida.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngemaphesenti lamangakhi emavoti Gingrich labe nawo elukhetfweni lwekucala?","The correct answer is **B: Emaphesenti langu-32**.

The question asks about Newt Gingrich's vote percentage in the primary election. The passage states: ""Ngumcondzisi Wetinkhulumo e-U.S. Kulendlu Newt Gingrich uphume waba wesibili ngemaphesenti langu-32.""  This translates to ""The U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich came in second with 32 percent of the vote.""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani longazange achubeke afuna imiphumela yemhlangano?","The correct answer is **B: NguBachmann**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Bachmann *won* the Ames Straw Poll and chose to focus on her campaign. This implies she didn't participate in the subsequent debate.
* Gingrich, Perry, and Romney all participated in the debate."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lowakhuluma kahle ngalomunye ngemuva kwemhlangano?","The correct answer is **A: NguBachmann**.

The text states: ""Bachmann, lowine i-Ames Straw Poll ngeNgci, ukhetse kucedza kukhankasa kwakhe."" This indicates that Bachmann chose to continue her campaign after the debate. The question asks who spoke *well* about someone *after* the debate. The text doesn't say who spoke well about whom, only what each person *did*. However, Bachmann's decision to continue campaigning implies she felt she performed well enough to warrant further effort. The other options are not supported by the text:

*   Gingrich endorsed Santorum and criticized Romney.
*   Perry is going back to Texas to assess the situation.
*   Romney is criticized by Gingrich.

Therefore, the most logical inference, based solely on the provided text, is that **Bachmann** is the one who chose to continue campaigning, implying a positive assessment of her performance, hence the answer is A.
"
Nguyiphi indzawo lokukuphela kwayo lapho lombukiso lowaba khona ngembi kwa-2015?,"The correct answer is **A: I-TogiNet Radio**.

The text states: ""Ekucaleni kwayo, lombukiso bewuvetwa kuphela kuwayilesi ye-inthanethi lebitwa ngekutsi yiTogiNet Radio..."" This means the show was only available on TogiNet Radio before being moved.

Option B is incorrect because the show's origin is mentioned, not where it was *only* available.
Option C is incorrect because AstroNet Radio was *later* established.
Option D is incorrect because it's too general; the text specifically mentions TogiNet Radio.
"
Siteshi sichaza lombukiso ngekutsi unjani?,"The correct answer is **D: Wasendzaweni (from the countryside)**.

The text states: ""Ekucaleni bewunemavi ebantfu labasebasha ekwenteni umbukiso, labahlala eceleni kwaseMphumalanga yeTexas."" This translates to ""It was a show with amateur people making the show, who lived on the outskirts of East Texas.""  Therefore, the show is described as being ""from the countryside.""
"
Yini David Headley layitfola ekugcineni leyasita tidlamlilo kutsi tihlasele?,"The answer is **A: Kwatiswa (Convicted)**.

The text states that David Headley was involved in planning and executing the attack. It doesn't say he received any of the weapons used in the attack. The text implies he was caught and ultimately found guilty (""kwatiswa"" means convicted).

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that he was convicted.
"
Nguyiphi intfo yekuhamba licembu letidlamlilo lelayisebentisa naliya eMumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Sikebhe (Ship)**.

The text states: ""Labahlaseli baseMumbai bafika ngemkhumbi ngeLweti 26, 2008..."" which translates to ""The Mumbai attackers arrived by boat on November 26, 2008...""  Therefore, they used a ship (sikebhe).
"
Ngumaphi emavi laveta kahle umphumela wemdlalo we-Nadal ne-Raonic’s Brisbane Open lokukhulunywa ngayo kulesicephu?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic wehlule Nadal**.

Here's why:

* The text states ""Lirekhodi laNadal nakatfolana nalomKhanada lingu 7-2."" This translates to ""Nadal's record against the Canadian is 7-2,"" implying Nadal won.
* The text also says ""Muva nje wehlulwe nguRaonic nesikhatsi kuvulwa lethonamenti yetheninisi,"" which translates to ""Raonic was recently defeated at the opening of the tennis tournament."" This reinforces that Nadal won.

Therefore, the most accurate summary of the outcome is that Raonic lost to Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raonic ube nemaphuzu langemaphesenti langu-88** - While Raonic had 88% first serve percentage, this doesn't describe the outcome of the match.
* **C: Nadal wehlule Raonic** - This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **D: Raonic ushaye emaphuzu langu-76** -  Nadal had 76 points in the first set, not Raonic."
"Ngekwalesicephu, bekangakanani emaphuzu emdlalo waNadal naRaonic ngemuva kwekudlala kwekucala?","The correct answer is **B: Nadala uwine emaphuzu langu-76**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nadal utfole emaphoyinti langemaphesenti langema-88 sekaphelele kulomdlalo wawina emaphoyinti langema-76 ekucaleni nje."" which translates to ""Nadal won points of 88 percent at the end of the match and won points of 76 at the beginning.""
"
Nguluphi luhlelo lwelulwimi lolungakafakwa etinhlelweni letintsatfu letinsha te-Naked News?,"The correct answer is **C: SiJaphane**.

The passage states that Naked News is adding Spanish, Italian, and Korean to its language offerings. It already reports in English and Japanese. Therefore, Japanese is already covered and not a new addition.
"
Ngekwalesicephu kukuphi lapho lenitenlo letinsha te Naked News letingeke tigfolakale knona?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubomahlalekhikhini**.

The text explicitly states: ""...icalisa luhlelo ngelulwimi lwe-Spanish, siTaliyane, kanye nesi-Korea kumabonakudze, kuwebhu, nakubomakhalekhikhini."" ( ""...the organization is planning to use Spanish, Italian, and Korean on television, on the web, and in **advertising**."")
"
Bangakhi bantfu labangazange bayicedze i-Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **C: 4**.

The text states: ""Besifazane labane emdlalweni wekuhamba echweni behlulekile kucedza umncintiswano wabo..."" which translates to ""Four women in the downhill race failed to compete in their race...""

Therefore, the answer is 4.
"
Ngumaphi emavi kulawa lalandzelako layiveta kahle imiphumela yeMcudzelwane?,"The best answer is **B: Labantjuzako labangu-45 abacedzanga ku-Giant Slalom**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Labantjuzako labangu-45 kulabangu 117 kulomdlalo lobewuseGiant Slalom behlulekile kuniketwa sigaba sabo kulomcudzelwano."" This directly relates to the number of athletes who didn't finish the Giant Slalom.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

* **A: Emcudzelwaneni wesibili, Carpenado uphume embili kwemntjuzi wase-Hungary:** The passage doesn't say Carpenado finished second *against* the Hungarian athlete. It just states his time and ranking.
* **C: Labantjuzako labengetiwe bayicedzile i-Giant Slalom kune-Slalom:** The passage doesn't give information about which athletes were favorites.
* **D: Carpenado uphumelele esigabeni selishumi ku-Slalom:** The passage states he finished in the top ten in Slalom, but it doesn't say he *succeeded* in it. It just states his ranking.

Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako i-NBA lencume kukukhipha?,"The correct answer is **A: Isizini ye-basketball**.

The question states the NBA *suspended* the basketball season due to COVID-19. The announcement was about the *season* being put on hold, not a specific player or team. While the Utah Jazz player's case triggered the announcement, the announcement itself was about the season.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyabangela i-NBA kutsi ibe nekukhatsateka ngaleligciwane?","The correct answer is **B: Badlali labanyenti batfolakele banalo emdlalweni we-Utah Jazz.**

The passage states the NBA is being cautious *because* a Utah Jazz player tested positive. However, it goes on to say this announcement follows *multiple* positive COVID-19 cases within the Utah Jazz team. This indicates the concern isn't just about one player, but a broader outbreak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emalunga e-NBA atfolakele analo:** While possible, the passage specifically mentions the Utah Jazz.
*   **C: Umdlai we-Utah Jazz akadlalanga kahle ngemuva kwekutfolakala nalo:**  The passage doesn't mention the player's performance. It's focused on the infection itself.
*   **D: Umdlali we-Utah Jazz utfolakele nalo:** This is partially true, but doesn't fully explain *why* the NBA is being cautious. The key is the broader implication of multiple positive cases.

Ngubani lofake ligoli lekuwina le-Washington Capitals emdlalweni ne-Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: NguNicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Ovechkin wasekela kwekucala kulobusuku nakasekela umdlali lomusha Nicklas Backstrom kukora leligoli lakhe lekuwina lomdlalo."" This means Nicklas Backstrom scored the game-winning goal.
"
Ngubani loshaye ligoli lakhe lesi-60 lesizini emdlalweni emkhatsini we-Capitals ne-Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: NguAlex Ovechkin**.

The text clearly states: ""Leligoli lakhe lesibili ngalobo busuku lenta kutsi emagoli lawashayile kulesizini afike ku 60 loku kumente waba ngumdlali wekucala kushaya emagoli langu 60 noma ngetulu nge sizini yinye, solo kwagcina nga Jaromir Jagr na Mario Lemieux nabo labakha lirekhodi nga 1995-96."" This directly identifies Alex Ovechkin as the player who reached 60 goals.
"
Kunini laphi libhange i-Northern Rock lidzinge khona kusekelwa nguhulumende?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngesikhatsi kunenkinga yesikweleti sekutsenga indzawo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Northern Rock beyidzinga lusito ngenca yekunekwa kwayo ebaleni ngesikhatsi inenkinga yesikweleti sayo lesingakavami nga-2007.""  This directly indicates the reason for the government bailout was due to a problem with its mortgage business.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lachaza kahle kusebentelana kwe-Virgin Group nelibhange le-Northen Rock?","The correct answer is **B: I-Virgin Group itsenge lelibhange ngemuva kwekutsi lifakwe ngephansi kwahulumende.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Licembu laSir Richard Branson lelibitwa ngekutsi yiVirgin Group belilibhidele lelibhange kodvwa sicelo salo sangaphumeleli ngaphambi kwekutsi hulumende alitsatse lelibhange."" This clearly indicates the government bafelela ukusatse libhange, before Virgin could successfully bid.
* Later, it says: ""Nge 2010, nalentiwa laba lelisive, lelibhange lanyalo lemgwaco lophakeme weNorthern Rock plc lahlukaniswa kule ´bad bank´, iNorthern Rock (Kuphatfwa Kwetintfo). I-Virgin itsenge kuphela """"lelibhange lelikahle"""" laseNyakatfo Rock, hhayi lenkapane yekuphatsa imphahla."" This confirms that Virgin Group only acquired the ""good bank"" (the actual bank) *after* the government had intervened and created a ""bad bank"" to handle the troubled assets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I-Virgin Group nayo itsenge inkampani yekulawula imphahla ye-Northen Rock:** The text explicitly says Virgin Group *didn't* sell the asset management company; they only sold the bank itself.
* **C: I-Virgin Group inikete lelibhange lusito loluphutfumako ngesikhatsi senkinga yesikweleti sekutsenga indzawo:** The text connects the bid with the *government intervention* and the bank being put under the government's control, not simply with a shortage of funds.
* **D: I-Virgin Group yalibhidela kwekucala lelibhange ngemuva kwekutsi lifakwe ngephansi kwahulumende:**  Virgin's initial bid failed *before* the government took action. They only succeeded after the government intervention.

"Njengobe kushiwo kulesicephu, nguliphi live lelitsintfwe kusayinwa kwesivumelwane sesimo selitulu lesentiwa eKyoto?","The correct answer is **A: Yi-United States**.

The passage states: ""Sincumo sa-Mr. Rudd sekusayina sivumelwano seKyoto sishiya iMelika..."" which translates to ""Mr. Rudd's statement is that the Kyoto agreement leaves America..."" This indicates the United States is the one not signing.
"
Hulumende waphambilini wase-Australia bewucabanga kutsi kucinisekiswa kweKyoto kutawubangela kulimanga kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Emnotfweni welive**.

The passage states that the former Australian government believed Kyoto would negatively impact the **livestock industry** because other major emitters like India and China weren't obligated to reduce emissions.  This implies a negative impact on industries reliant on those emitters, such as livestock which often rely on trade.
"
Nguluphi luhlelo badubuli bebabutselwe lona?,"The correct answer is **D: Luhlelo lwebatingeli lwe-Sporting Shooters Association**.

The text states: ""Ekusebentisaneni neNPWS neSporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, emavolontiya lafanelekako abhaliswa, ngaphansi kweluhlelo lwekutingela lweSporting Shooters Association.""  This directly indicates that the volunteers were registered under the Sporting Shooters Association's licensing scheme.
"
Ngumaphi emavi langakuveti kahle kulawulwa kwetinambutane lokuzanywako?,"The best answer is **A: Njengobe loluhlelo belwetanywa kwekucala, aluzange luhlolwe.**

Here's why:

* **The paragraph explicitly states:** ""Ekusebentisaneni neNPWS neSporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, emavolontiya lafanelekako abhaliswa, njengoba nalelicala lalibukiwe nekuphumelela kwalo kuhlolwa."" This directly translates to ""In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were required to be registered, as this case was reviewed and its success was assessed.""  The fact that the success *was assessed* implies it was a new program and hadn't been previously tested.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Labadubulako batfola ticondziso tekuceceshwa:** While true (they received safety training), it doesn't address the *overall control* of the shooting program.
* **C: Labadubulako bebacondziswa bogadzi:**  The paragraph indicates volunteers were required, not that they were supervised by a shooter.
* **D: Kwakhetfwa labadubulako labane:** This is a detail about the selection process, not an answer to the question about the *effectiveness* of the control measures.



Therefore, the core issue regarding the control of the shooting program is that it was a newly implemented system and hadn't yet been rigorously tested for effectiveness.

"Ngekwalesicephu, lokwehlukana kwatfolakala kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: E-Rift Valley**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngekuya kwaletinsalela, lokusho kutsi lokuhlukana kusheshe kwenteka kunalobekulindzelekile ngebufakazi be-molecular. Loko kusho kutsi konkhe kumelwe kubuyiselwe emuva,"" kusho umphenyi eRift Vallley Research Service e-Ethopia... This translates to ""According to the excavation, the difference occurs faster than expected with molecular evidence. This means everything must be dated back,"" and the researcher is from the Rift Valley Research Service in Ethiopia.

Therefore, the separation was found in the **Rift Valley**.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyenteka ngekushesha kunaloko bekulindzelekile?","The correct answer is **B: Kwehlukana (Separation)**.

The quote states: ""Ngekuya kwaletinsalela, lokusho kutsi lokuhlukana kusheshe kwenteka kunalobekulindzelekile ngebufakazi be-molecular.""  This directly translates to: ""According to the weathering, it means that separation happens faster than expected with molecular evidence.""

Therefore, the key event happening faster than expected is **separation**.

Yini umdlali lokutawudzingeka ayente kute akhone kuhamba emdlalweni wevidiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ahambise emoyeni lithulusi lekucondzisa (He controls the game by waving a wand and gyroscope).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...loyo loyichafatako usebentisa tintfo tekuva letimbili letibekwa eceleni kwalomabonakudze kuze ayehlukanise ibe tincenye letintsatfu. Loku kutovumela badlali kutsi balawule tento kanye nekushukuma emidlalweni yevidiyo ngekuhambisa umshini emoyeni.""  This translates to: ""...this innovative controller uses motion sensors placed around the screen to divide it into separate parts. This allows players to control the camera and movement in video games by waving a wand in the air.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Akaciniseke kutsi locondzisa ngako kubekwe kwacondzana nekhonsoli (It's not necessary that the controller is connected to the console):** The passage indicates it's a *wireless* controller, but doesn't say it's *not* connected to the console.  It's meant to be used *with* the console.
* **B: Ahambe aye etulu nasemaceleni (He moves around upstairs and on the walls):** This is not how the controller works.  The passage mentions waving a *wand* in the *air*.
* **C: Abeke isensa edvute namabonakudze (He places a sensor on the screen):** The passage says sensors are *around* the screen, not *on* it.



"
Yini leyentiwa ngendlela yekutsi ifane nerimothi yamabonakudze?,"The correct answer is **A: Emasensa lamabili elithulusi lekucondzisa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngalokufanana nerimothi yamabonakudze, loyo loyichafatako usebentisa tintfo tekuva letimbili letibekwa eceleni kwalomabonakudze kuze ayehlukanise ibe tincenye letintsatfu.""  This directly translates to: ""Similar to a TV remote, the controller uses two infrared sensors placed opposite the screen to divide it into separate sections.""

Therefore, the two infrared sensors are what make the controller function similarly to a TV remote.
"
Yini lengashiwongo embikweni losandza kuphuma lovela enhlanganweni lensha ye-Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Lendiza isongelwe ngebhomu (The plane was attacked by a bomb)**.

The question asks what is **not** mentioned in the report. The report *does* state the plane was reportedly attacked by a bomb and returned to Afghanistan. Option B is incorrect because the report states the plane went to Kandahar, not Ürümqi. Option C is incorrect because the report says the plane was *returned* to Afghanistan. Option D *is* mentioned in the report.

Therefore, the only option *not* mentioned is that the plane was attacked by a bomb.
"
Yni lengashiwongo embikweni wekucala wenhlangano lensha ye-Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **C: Lendiza yaphambukiswa yabuyiselwa e-Afghanistan**.

Here's why:

* The prompt states that the Xinhua news agency reported on an *incident involving a plane*.
* It also explicitly says the plane ""reported a bomb threat and was subsequently turned back to Afghanistan, specifically to Kandahar.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lendiza yatfunjwa (The plane was questioned):** While there might be an investigation, the core event is the bomb threat and the return to Afghanistan.
* **B: Lendiza ayivunyelwanga kutsi ihlale ngalokuphutfumako (The plane was not allowed to stay in that place):**  This is a consequence of the bomb threat, not the main reported event.
* **D: Lendiza isongelwe ngebhomu (The plane was targeted by a bomb):** The report states the plane *reported* a bomb threat, not that it *was* targeted.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the main information conveyed in the provided text."
Yini leyamenyetelwa nguSara Danius eluhlelweni lwewayilesi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikomidi kute timphendvulo letitfolile kulabahlanganyelako**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Sara Danius was on the radio discussing her inability to connect with Bob Dylan after he won the Nobel Prize. 
* She specifically mentions receiving friendly replies from everyone she contacted on his behalf.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lophumelele i-Nobel Prize kutetincwadzi:** While relevant to the context, it doesn't describe what Sara Danius *announced* on the radio.
* **C: Labanconyelwe i-Nobel Prize kutetincwadzi nga-2016:** This is incorrect. The passage focuses on her difficulty *connecting with* Dylan *after* winning the prize.
* **D: Ikomidi itokuma kwenta imetamo yekuchumana naBob Dylan:** This is the opposite of what she described. She was trying to *arrange* a meeting, but faced difficulties.



"
Ngubani lokungafinyelelwanga kuye?,"The correct answer is **D: NguBob Dylan**.

The text explicitly states that Sara Danius was unable to connect with Bob Dylan. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.

Ngubani lophawule watsi lesitsembiso “sisinyatselo lesikhulu”?,"The correct answer is **C: NguGordon Johndroe**.

The passage states: ""Lokkhulumela iBush, Gordon Johndroe ubite kutibandzakanya kweNyakatfo Koriya ngekutsi """"sinyatselo lesikhulu lesiyisa ekufinyeleleni umgomo wekususa emandla nyukliya etindzaweni letizungezwe ngemanti taseKoriya."""" This translates to: ""Speaking for Bush, Gordon Johndroe called the North Korean commitment a """"great achievement that brings us closer to the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons in the areas surrounding North Korea.""""

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe made the statement about it being a ""great achievement.""
"
Tingakhi titembu Słania latikhicitela emave lehlukahlukene?,"The correct answer is **D: Tingetulu kwa-1,000** (More than 1,000).

The text states: ""Ukhicite titembu letingetulu kwa-1000 taseSweden..."" which translates to ""He printed more than 1000 banknotes in Sweden...""

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokungenteka iyimbangela yekuvuta lokuchubekako kwemaventi elithange?","The correct answer is **C: Kwandza kwekushisa (Thermal Expansion)**.

Kuvuleka kwemavalvu kuvumela kutsi umoya uphume nekutsi kuphume oyili ungene ethangeni lelingafaka imiphongolo lengu-55,000..."" This indicates that the oil was expanding due to heat, forcing it out of the tank.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Indzawo yesibili yekugcina igcwalisiwe yaze yefika emtsameni:** While tank capacity is important, the text doesn't suggest the tank was simply full. The expansion of the oil is the primary cause mentioned.
* **B: Kuhlola lokwetayelekile kweluhlelo lwekulawula umlilo:** The text mentions a fire *after* the oil overflowed, but doesn't directly link the overflow to a fire system test.
* **D: Ngumlilo kulenye yemaphampu aseFort Greely:**  The text indicates a fire *after* the oil overflowed, but it does not state the fire originated in the pumps. The expansion of the oil is what caused the overflow.

"Njenganyalo, aphakeme kangakanani emanti e-The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Afika elukhalo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emanti agcwele ayacitseka kulelidamu esigabeni lesingu-100 feet bubanti."" This translates to ""The floodwaters reached a height of 100 feet of sand.""  While the other options are mentioned, they don't directly answer the question of *how high* the floodwaters reached in the Ninth Ward. The key phrase indicating the height is ""afika elukhalo,"" meaning ""reached a height of"".

Option A (Emafidi langu-20) refers to the height of the storm surge.
Option B (Ema-intji langu-6) refers to the rainfall amount.
Option D (Emafidi langu-100) refers to the height of the sand in the flood, not the water level.
"
"Ngesikhatsi kuneSiphelo Lokutsiwa NguKatrina, kwentekani e-The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **A: Emanti agcwala aba ngemafidi langu-100**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Emanti agcwele ayacitseka kulelidamu esigabeni lesingu-100 feet bubanti."" (The floodwaters overflowed the dam at a height of 100 feet.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emanti labefika elukhalo engca lugidzi** - The text doesn't mention floodwaters reaching a mile high.
* **C: Emanti bekangefidi langu-20 kuphakama** - The text explicitly says the floodwaters overflowed the dam at a height of 100 feet.
* **D: Imvula lengema-intji langu-6 ephula lolugidzi lolonakele** -  While the text mentions 6 inches of rain, it doesn't say this amount caused the 100-foot overflow. The rain contributed to the flooding of the dam, but the dam's failure at 100 feet is the key event described.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungazange kucinisekiswe nguHamilton?,"The correct answer is **B: Ematfuba ekutsi letinye tigulane titfole leligcinwane (The possibility of other patients contracting the disease)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Howard University Hospital *followed protocols for infection control* which included isolating the patient to protect others. This implies they *did* consider the possibility of the disease spreading to other patients. 

The other options are things the hospital *would* likely consider as part of infection control protocols:

*   **A: Kutsi siguli besiya kuphi (Where the patient came from):** Knowing the patient's origin is crucial for tracking the disease outbreak.
*   **C: Kutsi tinyatselo letifanele talandzelwa yini (What appropriate precautions were taken):**  Infection control protocols *include* taking appropriate precautions.
*   **D: Kutsi sigulane sikusiphi simo njenganyalo (What the patient's condition was like):** Understanding the patient's condition is essential for treatment and management.



Therefore, the only option that wasn't mentioned as being part of the protocols is the possibility of other patients catching the disease – and it's reasonable to assume that was a key concern and addressed within the infection control measures."
Yini bososayensi labafuna kuyitfola?,"The correct answer is **D: Kutsi uMhlaba wakheka kanjani**.

The passage states: ""Bososayensi betsemba kutsi batawucondza kutsi emaplanethi akheka njani, ikakhulukati kutsi uMhlaba wakheka njani..."" (Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed...).

The passage states: ""Emaloli ekutfutsa dodi bekuvinjwe ngawo imigwaco kwaze kwasita emaphoyisa langu-80 kutsi akhombise timoto  kutsi tihambe ngaletinye tindlela.""

This translates to: ""In the rush hour traffic, vehicles were stopped due to incidents, so 80 police officers had to redirect the cars to travel in other ways.""

Option C accurately reflects this action. The police redirected drivers due to the incidents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ancusa i-FBI kutsi ivale:**  While the FBI was involved, the police were the ones directly stopping and redirecting the traffic.
*   **B: Ancuma kutsi avale:** ""Ancuma"" means ""to accuse"". The passage doesn't state the police are accusing anyone of anything, just that they redirected traffic.
*   **D: Abika kubambeleleka kwetimoti kuleleminye imigwaco:** While there *were* incidents, the police action wasn't simply reporting them. They were taking direct action to manage the traffic.



"
Yini leyenteka ekungeneni kwemashubhu ngesikhatsi kuvaliwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Bekasetjentiselwe kuphambukisa (It was being diverted)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Maryland Transportation Authority closed a portion of the highway due to an FBI investigation. The reason for the closure was to allow police to inspect vehicles and reroute traffic. This directly supports the idea that traffic was being diverted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bekavalekile (It was closed):** While true, this doesn't explain *why* it was closed in the first place.
*   **C: Bekugcwele timoti letihamba embili (It was full of two-wheel vehicles):** The text doesn't mention anything about motorcycles.
*   **D: Bekavulekele bashayeli betimoti (It was open to motorists):** This is the opposite of what the text says; the highway was *closed*.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""police...told him not to come back."" This directly indicates that the photographer was told to *stay away* from the scene and the area related to the accident. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lomtsembuli wetitfombe wapaka imoti yakhe ku-Sepulveda Boulevard:** While the photographer did park his car, the act of parking isn't what's considered ""bad"" or problematic in this context.  It's the subsequent actions that are.
* **C: Lomtsembuli wetitfombe watsatsa titfombe tesitobhi semaphoyisa:** The passage doesn't mention the photographer taking pictures of the police station.
* **D: Lomtsembuli wetitfombe wakhona kutsatsa sitfombe saBieber:** The passage states the photographer was taking pictures of the accident, *not* of Bieber. While Bieber is involved in the story, the photographer wasn't taking pictures *of* him at the time of the accident.

Ngumaphi emavi langasichazi kahle simo samengameli ngemuva kwekutfolakala neligciwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Akativa kahle (Not feeling well)**.

The text states: ""...ngitiva ngikahle futsi ngiphilile futsi ngingakhona kuchubeka nemsebenti wami ngekuchumana nalabanye."" This translates to ""...I feel well and am healthy, but I cannot continue with my work without coming into contact with others.""  This implies he is *not* feeling well enough to work normally, even though he's generally healthy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Unemphimbo lobuhlungu (Has a fever):**  The text mentions a ""phimbo lobuhlungu"" (painful examination), but not a fever.
* **C: Simo sakhe sincono (His condition is improving):** While he states he feels well and healthy, the inability to work due to needing to avoid contact with others implies his condition isn't fully recovered yet. It's more of a limitation than improvement.
* **D: Unemfiva (Has a fever):** The text doesn't mention a fever.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...ngingakhona kuchubeka nemsebenti wami ngekuchumana nalabanye."" ( ...I am not able to work and not to come into contact with others.) This directly indicates he is self-isolating.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ute imfiva** (He has a fever) - The text mentions ""kushisa"" (temperature/fever), but it doesn't explicitly state he *has* a fever. It only mentions a temperature check.
* **B: Utawuchubeka asekhaya emaviki lambalwa** (He will stay home for several weeks) - The text says he *hopes* to return to work on Monday, not that he'll be home for weeks.
* **D: Leligciwane limbambe kamatima** (The virus is severe) - The text doesn't give any indication of the severity of the virus. It just says he has a mild infection.

Here's why:

The passage states the cyclone is expected to reach the Maldives. The question asks when the danger of being hit by it is expected to be greatest, given the wind speeds.  While wind speed is a factor, the *arrival* in the Maldives is the critical event that brings the danger to the location. The other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The wind speed of 83 km/h is already quite strong and a warning, but not the *arrival* of the danger.
*   **C:** Reaching a certain severity (category) is a factor, but the passage doesn't mention what category the cyclone is.
*   **D:** Reaching 149 km/h wind speed is a dangerous point, but again, the *arrival* in the Maldives is the key event.

Besingakanani sivinini semoya ngesikhatsi siphepho lokutsiwa ngu-Tropical Cyclone Gonu sinemandla kakhulu khona?,"The correct answer is **A: Emakhilomitha langu-149 ngeli-awa**.

The question asks about the wind speed *at the time the cyclone was at its strongest*. The text states: ""sifinyelele sivinini lesingemakhilomitha langu-240 ngeli-awa (149 yemamayela ngeli-awa)"".  This means the cyclone *reached* a wind speed of 240 km/h (149 mph). However, the question asks about the wind speed *at the time the cyclone was at its strongest*. While 240 km/h is the maximum *reached*, 149 km/h (93 mph) is the wind speed mentioned in the context of the current morning, suggesting that's closer to the strength at the time the information was being reported. The question doesn't specify whether the reported speed is the maximum reached or the current speed. However, among the options, 149 km/h is the only one that reflects the cyclone's intensity at the time the question is being asked, making it the most plausible answer. Therefore, the best fit is A.

Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungasiso sici se-Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **A: Ingulolunye luhlobo lwetihlahla tasemantini (It is a type of marine algae).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Emanti labovu aselwandle abangelwa kukhuphuka ngendlela lengaketayeleki kwe-Kerenia, intfo lengekwemvelo lebitwa ngekutsi yi-marine organism.""  This translates to: ""Harmful algal blooms caused by the abnormal growth of Kerenia, a non-native substance called a marine organism.""  The later description details the effects of *Karenia brevis*, a specific type of marine algae.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ingakhubata imiva yebantfu (It can sting people):** While the passage mentions that the ""shevu lolimata simiso setimva"" (the toxins released by the algae) can irritate skin and eyes, it doesn't state that the algae *stings* people directly.
*   **C: Inemaseli lamanyenti (It has oily cells):** The passage doesn't mention oily cells.
*   **D: Itivelela ngekwemvelo (It spreads naturally):** While the passage says the blooms can occur naturally, it also emphasizes that *Karenia brevis* is a ""non-native substance.""  This implies it's not a naturally occurring part of the ecosystem in that region.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate description based on the provided text."
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako iKarena brevis lengakhoni kukwenta?,"The correct answer is **D: Kukhicita i-neurotoxin** (Releases a neurotoxin).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inkhushe ikhicita shevu lolimata simiso setimva, loshevu ungalimata timva kubantfu nasetimfishini.""  This translates to ""The shark releases a venomous secretion, this secretion can paralyze the hearing of people and fish.""  A neurotoxin is a type of venom that affects the nervous system, causing paralysis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kukhubata imiva yetinhlanti** (Breaks the fins of fish): The passage doesn't mention the shark breaking fins.
* **B: Kwandza kakhulu ngaphansi kwanome ngutiphi timo** (Moves very quickly underwater):  While sharks are fast, the passage focuses on the venom, not their speed.
* **C: Kuphazamisa emanti** (Pollutes the water): While the shark's presence might have environmental impacts, the primary dangerous effect described is the venom.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungazange kwenteke ngenca ye-Siphepho Lokutsiwa Ngu-Felicia?","The correct answer is **C: Umbane lophindzaphindzako (Lightning)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the following: ""Imvula lefinyelela kuma-inch langu-6.34 esikalini e-Oahu, ichazwe njengaleyo """"lezuzisako"""". Letinye timvula betihambisana nekudvuma **nembani**."" (The rain reached 6.34 inches in Oahu, described as ""torrential"". Other rains were accompanied by **thunder and lightning**.)

While the passage *mentions* thunder and lightning as accompanying the rain, it **doesn't mention** power outages. Therefore, power outages are the event that *didn't* happen according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imvula lenenzuzo (Torrential rain):** The passage explicitly states the rain was ""lezuzisako"" (torrential).
*   **B: Imvula lehambisana nekudvuma (Rain accompanied by thunder):** The passage explicitly states the rain was accompanied by thunder.
*   **D: Kugcwala kwemanti emgwacweni (Flooding in gutters):** The passage mentions potential flooding due to the heavy rain.



"
Ngumaphi emavi langasilo liciniso ngeSiphepho Lokutsiwa Ngu-Felicia?,"The correct answer is **A: Imvula lehambisana naso yazuzisa i-Oahu.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Imvula lefinyelela kuma-inch langu-6.34 esikalini e-Oahu, ichazwe njengaleyo """"lezuzisako""""."" This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are not as accurate:

* **B: Sacale safakwa ngaphansi kwemoya lowenteka etindzaweni letishisako ngembi kwekusi sibe siphepho lesisesigabeni 4:** While the text mentions the storm was a Category 4, it doesn't specify *when* it reached that status or what conditions led to it.
* **C: Linyenti letichingi latfola imvula:** The text says the rain reached *Oahu*, not necessarily the entire ""letinyenti letichingi"" (which seems to refer to the entire state of Hawaii).
* **D: Letinye taletimvula betihambisana nembani:** This is true based on the text, but option A is a more direct and comprehensive statement of a key fact.



"
Ngumaphi emavi laveta kahle imiphumela ye-Hungarian Grand Prix ya-2009?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. wacoshwa kamuva.**

The text explicitly states: ""Piquet Jr. wacoshwa ngemuva kweHungarian Grand Prix yanga-2009."" (Piquet Jr. was fired after the Hungarian Grand Prix of 2009.)
"
Yenteke nini lengoti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngekushesha ngemuva kwekuma kwa-Alonso kuze imoti yakhe ilungiswe.**

The text states: ""Piquet Jr. washayisa kuSingapore Grand Prix yanga-2008 ngemuva kwekutsi Fernando Alonso eme ngekushesha, kwakhokhwa lemoto yetekuphepha."" This translates to: ""Piquet Jr. crashed at the Singapore Grand Prix in 2008 after Fernando Alonso slowed down, and the safety car was deployed.""  The safety car was deployed *immediately* after Alonso slowed down.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokwatsatsa sikhatsi lesincane kunaleso bacwaningi lebebakukholelwa ekucaleni?","The correct answer is **C: Kutalana emkhatsini wetinhlobonhlobo tetintfo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the researchers initially believed the beak shape changes in the Galapagos finches were due to the interaction between the Darwin's finch, the Geospiza bird, and the cactus.  The question asks what else was thought to be the cause, *before* the researchers' new findings. The passage implies the initial belief was that the changes were due to **adaptation/interaction** *between* different species (finch and cactus).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuba khona kwenhlobonhlobo tetintfo (The existence of different species):** While the existence of different species is a given, it doesn't explain *why* the beak shapes changed.
* **B: Kubika ngetinhlobonhlobo tetintfo (Reporting on species):** This is too general.  The passage is about *changes* in species, not just reporting on them.
* **D: Kutigucukela kwetinhlobonhlobo tetintfo (Transforming into species):**  This suggests speciation, which isn't what the passage describes. The changes are in beak *shape*, not the creation of new species.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungazange kubikwe bacwaningi?,"The correct answer is **A: Takheka kuphi tinhlobonhlobo letinsha tetintfo** (The structure of these finch species).

Here's why:

* The question asks what the researchers *haven't* reported. The passage states they reported on the structure of the finches and their adaptation to different food sources.
* The phrase ""Bacwaningi labasuka eNyuvesi yasePrinceton eMelika nase Nyuvesi yase-Uppsala eSweden babikile ngaletinhlobo letinsha etitukulwaneni letimbili..."" implies they've already described the finches' *dietary adaptations* (eating different seeds).
* The passage doesn't mention anything about the *names* of the finch species (C), the *evolutionary history* (B), or *migration patterns* (D). While the adaptation is linked to the cactus, the focus of the report, according to the passage, is on the finches' structure and how it relates to their food sources.



Therefore, the missing information is the detailed structural analysis of these finch species.



"
I-CowParade itawuba kuphi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuyo yonkhe iningizimu ye-Yurophu**

The text states: ""Lelidolobha litoba ngelekucala eningizimu yempumalanga yeYurophu kubamba iCowParade..."" which translates to ""This city will host, for the first time, the CowParade in southeastern Europe..."".  Therefore, the CowParade is happening throughout southeastern Europe.
"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako layichaza kahle i-CowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngumcimbi webuciko lomkhulu kunayo yonkhe emhlabeni**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...umcimbi webuciko wemphakatsi lomkhulu kunayo yonkhe emhlabeni..."" which directly translates to ""...a public art event that is the biggest in the world...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iba khona kuphela emadolobheni latsatfwa ngekutsi “ayatfutfuka”** (It only exists in cities that are ""scattered"" or ""spread out"").  The text doesn't mention cities being scattered.
* **B: Yentiwa yi-Bucharest City Hall** (It is organized by the Bucharest City Hall). While the text *mentions* the Bucharest City Hall wanting to replicate the event, it doesn't say they *organize* the CowParade.
* **C: Ngumcimbi webuciko lobanjwa ehlobo kuyo yonkhe iningizimu yeYurophu** (It is an art event held throughout all of Southern Europe). The text specifically mentions it takes place between the North and South Poles, indicating a much wider scope than just Southern Europe.

Yini leyabangela kutsi iRussia ivale kusetjentiswa kwe-II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: Ingoti**.

The text explicitly states: ""I-Il-76 beyisolo ilithuzi lelikhulu lemabutfo omabili eRussia neSoviet kusukela ngabo-1970, futsi seyihlangabetane nengoti lenkhulu eRussia kulenyanga lephelile."" This translates to: ""The Il-76 is a major military transport aircraft of both Russia and the Soviet Union since the 1970s, and it collided with a large vessel of the Russian Navy last month."" The collision with the Navy vessel is what caused the temporary grounding of the Il-76s.
"
Iyini i-II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Lithange**.

The text states: ""I-Il-76 beyisolo ilithuzi lelikhulu lemabutfo omabili eRussia neSoviet kusukela ngabo-1970...""  This translates to ""The Il-76 is a large military transport aircraft used by both Russia and the Soviet Union since the 1970s...""  Therefore, it is an aircraft, which means it's a plane or **lithange** (which translates to ""airplane"" or ""aircraft"" in isiSiSwati).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umkhumbi lohamba phansi emantini** - This translates to ""a tank that moves on the ground in the morning"". This is a tank, not an aircraft.
*   **C: Indizamshini** - This translates to ""a machine"". This is too general and doesn't describe the specific type of vehicle.
*   **D: Sitimela** - This translates to ""a train"". This is a train, not an aircraft.



"
Ngubani lowacashela i-The Simpsons licembu lekubhala?,"The correct answer is **B: NguSimon**.

The passage states: ""Nga-1989 wasita kwenta The Simpsons banaBrooks naGroening, futsi nguye lowacasha licembu lekubhala lalombukiso."" which translates to ""In 1989 he started The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and he was the one who created the writing team for the show.""  ""He"" refers to Simon.

"Ngekwa Fluke, ngubani lobekamtfumelela emavi netikhutsato letakhako?","The answer is **D: Kokubili labadvuna nalabasikati** (Both farmers and herders).

The text states: ""tintfo tekuhlela umndeni kutsatfwe njengentfo lebalulekile kutekwelapha. **kusebentisa tintfo tekuhlela umndeni kutsatfwe njengentfo lebalulekile kutekwelapha. kusebentisa tintfo tekuhlela umndeni kutsatfwe njengentfo lebalulekile kutekwelapha. kusebentisa tintfo tekuhlela umndeni kutsatfwe njengentfo lebalulekile kutekwelapha. kusebentisa tintfo tekuhlela umndeni kutsatfwe njengentfo lebalulekile kutekwelapha**"". This implies that the knowledge and solutions were gathered from both farmers and herders, as they are the ones who have experience with family planning and its impact on health. The question specifically asks who provided the information and solutions, and the text doesn't name any specific group like doctors or veterinarians. It highlights the knowledge shared by farmers and herders.



Therefore, the best answer reflecting the information in the provided text is **D**.

"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini labanye bantfu lebebangafuni bantfu labasikati bakhulume ngayo?","The correct answer is **C: Imphilo yalabasikati (The life of women).**

Here's why:

The question asks what *other people* might *not* want women to talk about, based on the text. The text states Fluke *facilitates* women sharing their successful life stories. This implies that there might be reasons why others *wouldn't* want this sharing to happen.

The text *doesn't* mention:

*   **A: Bantfu labadvuna (The poor):** While poverty might be a topic in some women's stories, the text doesn't link it directly to something others wouldn't want discussed.
*   **B: Tindlela tesibhedlela (Hospital methods):**  This is irrelevant to the text's focus on women sharing their life experiences.
*   **D: I-Fluke:** Fluke is the organization facilitating the sharing, not a topic that people might not want discussed.

Therefore, the most logical inference is that **the life of women** (specifically their experiences and successes) is what might be a topic others would avoid or not want to be discussed openly, possibly due to societal pressures, limitations, or other reasons implied by the need for Fluke to facilitate these conversations.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi intfo emkhatsini lehamba kakhulu?","The correct answer is **A: Umhlaba**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Stofan is comparing Titan to Earth, saying Earth is ""bigger"" than Titan. Therefore, Earth is the object being described as larger, and thus moving ""further along"" in the comparison.
"
Imifula nemachibi lanalokungemanti itfolakele kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The quote states: ""Ngokwaloko lesikwatiko, kunendzawo yinye yeplanethi lekhombisa bukhulu kundlula i-Titan, ligama layo nguMhlaba."" (Therefore, there is one other planet that shows a size greater than Titan, its name is Earth).

The passage then goes on to describe Titan's atmosphere as being so thick that it obscures the view of the seabed and small creatures in the ocean. This implies that Titan *does* have oceans and potentially other bodies of liquid, like rivers and lakes, obscured by a thick atmosphere.

Therefore, the statement indicates that Titan is the planet where rivers, lakes, and oceans (and the things within them) are hidden by a dense atmosphere.
"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokutfolakele lokungasiwo umphumela walokunye lokuye kwatfolakala ngetinsiba?,"The correct answer is **B: Kucondza lokutsi tinsiba atisetjentiswanga ekundizeni.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that scientists believe the structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight. It says, ""...scientists have found that the structure of these dinosaur feathers suggests they were not used for flight but rather to regulate body temperature or display.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umbala wetimphiko tesilwane (Color of animal feathers):** The passage mentions color changes in feathers as a result of evolutionary changes, but it doesn't directly link the *structure* of the feathers to color.
* **C: Kucondza ngekugucuka kwetinsiba (Suggests evolution of feathers):** While the discovery of feathers is significant and points to evolution, the question asks what the structure of the feathers *doesn't* explain. The passage focuses on flight, not evolution itself.
* **D: Sicinisekiso sekutsi ema-dinosaur anetinsiba (Confirmation that dinosaurs had feathers):** The passage discusses the discovery of feathers but it does not focus on confirming that dinosaurs *had* feathers."
Yini tinsiba te-dinosaur betite kona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ematsambo (Vertebrae)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bososayensi batsi tinsiba talesilwane betinsundvu etulu bese siba nembala lophaphatsekile emaceleni. Lolokutfolakele kuniketa kucondza kwekushintjashintjwa kwetimphiko tetinyoni.

This indicates that scientists examined the vertebrae (rachis) and found barb-like structures (barbs and barbules) on them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ema-barbules:** Barbules are *part* of the structure on the vertebrae, not the vertebrae themselves.
*   **C: Timphiko letindzala (Feather-like structures):** The text says the structures weren't used for flight, so they weren't feathers.
*   **D: Lingaphansi lelinembala lophaphatsekile (Underneath with mottled color):** This describes the color of the skin, not the structure of the vertebrae.

Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako mayelana ne-ZMapp langasilo liciniso?,"The correct answer is **D: Lucwaningo luvete kutsi tinzuzo tayo tincane kunaleto ekucaleni bekucatjangwa kutsi inato.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""I-cocktail yemasotja emtimba, iZMapp, kwekucala yaniketa litsemba kulendzima, kepha tifundvo letihlelekile takhomba kutsi inelusito loluncane kunalokudzingekile kuvimbela kufa.""  This directly translates to ""The military cocktail, ZMapp, initially gave hope in the face of the disease, but rigorous studies have shown that it has a very small chance of preventing death."" This aligns perfectly with option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yakhiwa ngemasotja emtimba** - The passage does say it's a ""cocktail yemasotja emtimba"" (military cocktail), but doesn't elaborate on where it was built.
* **B: Iyakhona kwelapha titfo letivele tikhona kodvwa akukuvikeli kufa** -  The passage doesn't mention it being used *after* someone is already infected, only as a treatment being tested.
* **C: Isebenta ekulawuleni elucwaningweni lwe-PALM** - The passage mentions ZMapp *was* used in the PALM study, but doesn't say it controlled the study. It was *part* of the study.



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako laluchaza kahle lucwaningo lwe-PALM?,"The best answer is **B: Sidzakamiva lesilawulako sacatsaniswa naletinye tindlela tekwelapha, lenye yato bekuyi-ZMapp**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ngoluhlolo lwe-PALM, ZMapp yasetjentiswa ngenjongo yekucodzisa, lokusho kutsi bososayensi bayisebentisa njengesisekelo futsi bacatsanisa naleti letinye tindlela letintsatfu tekwelapha."" This means the study compared ZMapp to other treatment approaches.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Luhlolo luvete kutsi ingaba netinzuzo letinyenti kunaleto beticatjangwa:** While the passage *hints* at this by saying ZMapp showed limited effectiveness, it doesn't definitively state the study *found* significant benefits over the control.
* **C: I-ZMapp yasetjentiswa njengesisekelo selucwaningo:** This is true, but it doesn't fully capture the core of the PALM study, which was the *comparison* of ZMapp *with other treatments*.
* **D: Yabonakala iphumelela ekwelapheni tifo letivele tikhona:** The passage states ZMapp showed *limited* effectiveness, not that it was successful in treating existing cases.

Bacwaningi bacabanga kutsi i-chip lensha itoba lusito kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Emave laphuyile** (Under the skin).

The text states: ""Bacwaningi labahamba embili batsi loku kungabangela kutfolakala kwemdlavuza kusenesikhatsi...lapho kuphila nangabe unesifo lesinjengemdlavuza welibele kungaba sehhafini kumave lanotsile.""  This implies the chip is implanted *under the skin*. The phrase ""mave lanotsile"" (under the skin) directly points to this location.

Nguyiphi indlela letawusetjentiswa nakwakhiwa lithulusi lekuhlola?,"The correct answer is **B: Emaphrinta lavamile e-inkjet**.

The passage explicitly states: ""intfo lencane lephrinthekako lengakhiwa kusetjentiswa iphrinta i-inkjet levamile..."" which translates to ""a tiny, printable thing that can be built using a regular inkjet printer...""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi emavi langasilo liciniso mayelana nema-lobate scarps?","The correct answer is **A: Loko lokwabangela kutsi akheke kungenteka kusandza kwenteka**

Here's why:

The passage states that the lobate scarps are remnants found throughout the month and appear small, indicating a gradual process of formation.  This directly supports the idea that the cracking and fragmentation (the ""akheke"" - to crumble/flake) is a result of a gradual process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuba khona kwawo kusho kutsi inyanga inaso sandla kulokwenteka emhlabeni:** The passage explicitly says this contradicts the idea that the moon is involved in earthly activities.
* **C: Kungenteka avela ngenca yekuncipha kwenyanga:** The passage focuses on the physical properties of the scarps, not the moon's shrinking.
* **D: Akasimanyenti latfolakala enyangeni:**  The passage states that the remnants *are* found throughout the month.



Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the information given in the passage."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumuphi umbono mayelana nekuma kwemhlaba loveta kutsi kukhona lokwentekako enyangeni lokutsintsa umhlaba?","The correct answer is **D: Lokwenteka kwetintfo emhlabeni kusandza kwenteka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bososayensi batfole kutsi tintfo letakhe umhlaba tigcwele ngasenyangeni futsi tibitwa ngekutsi ngema-lobate scarps lakheke ngekutsi inyanga inciphe kancane kancane."" This translates to: ""Scientists have found that the Earth is full of things that are called lobate scarps and that the moon is slowly shrinking.""  The subsequent sentence emphasizes this gradual decrease: ""Lomtsetfo wekusebenta kwetintfo uphikisana nendzaba yekutsi inyanga ayisebentisani nemisebenti leyentiwa emhlabeni."" which means ""This pattern of action contradicts the notion that the moon does not play a role in the activities that happen on Earth.""  Therefore, the core idea is that the shrinking of the moon is a gradual process, implying a slow but continuous transformation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inyanga iyancipha kancane kancane:** While true, it's a description of *what* is happening, not a broader *understanding* of the process.
* **B: Lokwanteka kwetintfo emhlabeni kwenteka kadzeni:** The text actually suggests the opposite - things are *evolving* or changing, not happening ""suddenly.""
* **C: Kunetintfo letincane kakhulu enyangeni:** The text refers to ""lobate scarps"" which are geological features, not ""tiny things"" on the moon.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengeke ibe ngetulu kwaloku kuze kubekwe licala?","The correct answer is **B: Kushicilelwa Kwetitfombe (Publication of photos)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""bufakazi babofakazi labatibonele bungase bumoshakale ngoba sitfombe sakhe sesifakwe sagcwala yonkhe indzawo."" (Witness evidence might be compromised because photos of him have been widely circulated.)

The passage also mentions that the Crown Office is concerned about the publication of the photos: ""The Crown Office, which oversees prosecutions, told the press that the timing of the release is tied to when the case is brought to court.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emavi lengetiwe (Pre-trial statements)** - The passage doesn't say anything about pre-trial statements.
*   **C: Kucoca ngebufakazi balabatibonele ngewabo (Witnesses testifying in their own words)** - The passage mentions witness evidence *might* be compromised, but it doesn't say that witnesses aren't testifying.
*   **D: Kushicilelwa kwetihloko (Publication of articles)** - While article publication is a possibility, the text directly focuses on the *photos* being a concern.

Therefore, the most direct answer based on the text is that the publication of photos is the issue that would prevent a case from being formally brought to court."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengasiyo inkinga lekhona nyalo kubantfu labatingela emasili?","The correct answer is **A: Simo selitulu lesibi kakhulu (Poor gut health)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the poor gut health is the *primary* reason for the severe problems. It also highlights the significant and unusual combination of large and hard stools.  While stool size and hardness are issues, the underlying problem is the poor gut health causing these issues. The passage emphasizes that the gut health is the root cause of the problem.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
"Ngetulu kwelichwa, yini lenye lephazamisa imetamo yekuhlenga?","The correct answer is **B: Simo selitulu**.

The text explicitly states: ""Simo selitulu lesibi kakhulu sibambetele imitamo yekusindzisa"" which translates to ""The very bad soil condition has hampered the plant's growth."" The text also mentions that the soil is extremely poor.

Therefore, the bad soil condition is the other factor hindering the plant's growth, in addition to the locust infestation.
"
Nguyiphi inkholela Roberts lagwema kuyicinisekisa?,"The correct answer is **D: Lilungelo lekugcina tintfo tiyimfihlo.**

Here's why:

The text states that Roberts ""utsite akukalungi kukhuluma ngaletintfo"" (was uncomfortable speaking about it) and that he didn't agree with the belief that ""abekholelwa elungelweni lekugcina tintfo tiyimfihlo"" (believers in the sanctity of life). This directly refers to the abortion issue and the right to privacy surrounding it, as established in Roe v. Wade.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Similo sekucoca ngemacala (Similarity in case interpretation):** While the text mentions Roe v. Wade, it doesn't focus on comparing the interpretation of cases.
* **B: Kubaluleka kwetijubo teNkantolo Lephakeme letingashintjashintji (Importance of unchangeable Supreme Court precedents):** Roberts *did* emphasize the importance of unchangeable precedents by calling Roe v. Wade an ""unchanging landmark"" case.
* **C: Kucala kwemphilo (Sanctity of life):** While related, the text doesn't say Roberts avoided confirming the sanctity of life itself. He avoided confirming a *belief* in the sanctity of life as it relates to the abortion issue.



"
Ngusiphi sihloko Roberts leva ngatsi asifaneleki kutsi kucocwe ngaso?,"The correct answer is **B: Sincumo ecaleni la-Roe naWade**.

Here's why: The passage explicitly states that Roberts ""utsite akukalungi kukhuluma ngaletintfo"" (is uncomfortable talking about this matter) and that his statement about Roe v. Wade being an ""unchanging landmark"" signifies the importance of the ""ungagucugucuki kwemtsetfo weNkantolo Lephakeme"" (unchanging nature of Supreme Court precedent).  The passage also mentions the belief that ""tintfo tiyimfihlo"" (life is a sanctity) and refers to ""sincumo saRoe"" (the Roe ruling).  All of this points directly to the Roe v. Wade decision and the controversy surrounding it as the topic Roberts is reluctant to discuss.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kungashintjashintji kweTijubo Tenkantolo Lephakeme (The unchanging nature of Supreme Court precedent):** While Roberts *did* emphasize the importance of precedent, the core reluctance seems tied to the *specific* precedent of Roe v. Wade.
* **C: Lilungelo lebumfihlo lobunconywako (The right to privacy):** The right to privacy is relevant to Roe v. Wade, but the passage focuses more on the ruling itself and the life/sanctity of life arguments.
* **D: Imininingwane yemacala (Case details):** The passage doesn't delve into the specific details of any case, but rather focuses on Roberts' discomfort in commenting on the overall issue of Roe v. Wade.



"
Imisebe yekukhanya lemibili ikhanya kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubheka esibhakabhakeni**

The passage states: ""Imisebe lemibili yekukhanya imiswe yabuka etulu, kuze ikhombe esibhakabhakeni ebusuku."" (The two lights were switched on to look at the sky, pointing to the sky at night.)

"Ngekwalesicephu, titezi titokwakhiwa nini kulendzawo?","The correct answer is **C: Ebusuku**.

The text states: ""Ngabo 8:46 ekuseni kwathula kwatsi cwaka edolobheni ngesikhatsi indiza ifika labeyiya khona. Imisebe lemibili yekukhanya imiswe yabuka etulu, kuze ikhombe esibhakabhakeni **ebusuku**.""  This translates to ""Around 8:46 am, a sound woke the city as a plane arrived and landed. Two beams of light were turned on, pointing to the sky **at night**."" Therefore, the construction of the buildings happened at night.
"
Ngukuphi kwatiswa lokuveta kutsi i-The Seven Sisters mihume?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwehlukahluka kwemazinga ekushisa**.

The passage states: ""Tintfombe telizinga lekushisa kwasebusuku nakwasemini tikhombisa kutsi kungenteka kunemehluko."" (Photographs of day and night temperature levels show that differences are important.)  This indicates that the temperature variations are a key factor in understanding where the Seven Sisters comets are located and how they behave.
"
Kubonakala kanjani kushisa ku-Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **B: Imigodzi lejulile emhlabatsini**.

The passage states: ""Kushisa kwawo akukemi ndzawonye njengemihume lemikhulu emhlabeni lokuvame kuba lizinga lekushisa lelifanako sikhatsi lesinyenti, kodvwa kuyefana ngaloku kuyimigodzi lephansi kakhulu kulomhlaba..."" which translates to ""Their temperature isn't the same as that of larger comets on Earth often because the temperature level is the lowest on Earth..."".  This indicates that the Seven Sisters have extremely low temperatures, comparable to the coldest parts of Earth. Option B accurately reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngetitfombe te-infrared:** While infrared images *were* used to measure the temperature, the passage doesn't directly say this is *how* the temperature is characterized, but rather *what* the temperature *is*.
*   **C: Bukhulu bemihume:** The passage discusses the *size* of the comets, not their temperature.
*   **D: Luhlolo lwemihume emhlabeni:** The passage isn't characterizing the comets in terms of how they resemble things on Earth. Instead, the passage is contrasting the comets' temperatures with that of Earth.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi emavi langasilo liciniso mayelana nemsolwa?","The correct answer is **B: Kusolwa kutsi wachumisa sichumane** (He is accused of planting an explosive device).

Here's why:

* The first sentence of the text states: ""Lendvodza lesolelwe kuchumisa ibhomu yabanjwa emvakwekulimala kulokuchuma."" This translates to: ""This man is accused of planting a bomb at the scene of the incident.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wasebentisa imoti kulokuhlasela** (He used a car to attack): The text doesn't mention the use of a car.
* **C: Buve bakhe batiwa tiphatsimandla** (His relatives are said to be influential): While the text mentions he is considered a leader of the Uyghur community, it doesn't state his relatives are influential.
* **D: Bekangakalimali** (He was injured): The text doesn't mention him being injured.



"
Ngukuphi kwatiswa lokumayelana nekuhlaselwa lokucinisekiswe tiphatsimandla?,"The correct answer is **D: Ligama nesibongo semsolwa (The name and surname of the accused)**.

The question asks where information about the alleged assault was found. The text states: ""Ligama lakhe solo alatiwa kutiphatsimandla, nobe bati kutsi ulilunga leluhlanga lemaUighur."" This translates to: ""His name is not known to the authorities, but it is said that he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group.""  This information is about the *accused* – his name and ethnic affiliation.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutsi bobani lebebasebentisana nemsolwa (Who are the people involved with the accused):** While the text implies others are involved, the core information related to where the assault was found is about the accused's identity.
*   **B: Buve bemsolwa (The address of the accused):** The text doesn't provide the accused's address.
*   **C: Sisusa salokuhlasela (The location of the assault):** The text mentions the assault occurred at the community center, but it doesn't say where *information* about the assault was found.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **D**."
Nguliphi licembu lelitodla emdlalweni e-Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **A: All Blacks ne-Australia**.

The text states: ""Umdlalo wekugcina waloluchungechunge utobanjelwa e-Ellis Park eJozi kuleliviki lelitako, Amabhokobhoko atodlala ne-Australia."" which translates to ""The last match of the series will be held at Ellis Park in Jozi this week, the Springboks will play Australia.""  Therefore, the match at Ellis Park is between the All Blacks and Australia.
"
Ema-Springboks atawudlalela kuphi umdlalo wawo lolandzelako?,"The correct answer is **C: E-Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Umdlalo wekugcina waloluchungechunge utobanjelwa e-Ellis Park eJozi kuleliviki lelitako, Amabhokobhoko atodlala ne-Australia."" This translates to: ""The final match of the series will be held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg this week, the Springboks will play Australia.""
"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako siteshi sasemkhatsini lesibe nenkinga nako ekhatsi nalomsebenti?,"The correct answer is **B: Kugcina i-gyroscope**.

The text states: ""Bantfu labasebenta kulesiteshi bachubeke nesimo sabo sengcondvo lesihle, ngisho noma kulahleke i-gyroscope ekucaleni..."" (The people working at the station maintained their good condition, even though the gyroscope was lost at the beginning...)

This indicates that the loss of the gyroscope was the problem the station faced during the mid-flight operation. Therefore, keeping the gyroscope is the correct answer.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, wawuyini umgomo wesiteshi sasemkhatsini?","The correct answer is **C: Kucedzela luhamba lwasemkhatsini**.

The text states that the station's crew was able to maintain their health and continue the mission even after losing a gyroscope. They also successfully performed the docking maneuver. This strongly indicates the primary goal of the mid-course was to complete the planned trajectory and docking.
"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langesilo liciniso ngelicala?,"The correct answer is **D: I-AOL yabekwa licala.**

Here's why:

* The question states: ""Lelicala licalaphelelwa ngemuva kokukhishwa kwe-inthanethi ye-AOL...lenkampani legcugcutele lamacala."" This directly indicates that AOL was sued.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Latekwa esifundzeni lapho i-AOL inenhlokohhovisi khona:** While the lawsuit likely took place in a jurisdiction where AOL had a presence, the question doesn't specify this.  The core point is that AOL *was* sued.
* **B: Kwakhishwa sigwebo:** The text doesn't mention a settlement or any kind of deal being reached.
* **C: Kulelicala kwasetjentiswa umtsetfo lomayelana nemilayeto yelikheli le-inthanethi langafuneki:** While the lawsuit *did* involve issues related to illegal online conduct, the question isn't specifically asking about the *type* of law that was broken.  The key takeaway is that AOL was sued.



Therefore, the only fact explicitly stated in the passage is that AOL was sued.
"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lalichaza kahle lelicala?,"The best answer is **A: I-AOL yabekwa licala lekutfumela kungacelwanga.**

Here's why:

* The question asks what *best* describes the case. The passage states that the case involved ""ukucala kwekucala kutsi kube nalotsite lolahlwa licala ngemtsetfo lowashaywa nga-2003 kuze kuncishiswe ema-e-mail lamanyenti, kuncishiswe nebantfu labangena tindzaba tebantfu, kanye nebantfu labangacelwa kutsi basakate lokutsite.""  This describes a case related to spam and unwanted emails, which falls under the category of ""allowing unsolicited communications.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Lelicala belimbandzakanya tinkapani letimbili letihamba phambili ngekuniketa nge-inthanethi** - While true (AOL was a major player), the core of the case wasn't *just* that it involved a prominent company. The issue was the spam itself.
* **C: Lelicala latekwa nga-2003** - While the case *was* filed in 2003, the date alone doesn't describe the case's *nature*.
* **D: I-AOL yacalisa kutekwa kwalelicala** - The passage says AOL *was* sued, not that they initiated the lawsuit.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguliphi licembu Vidal lacale kulidlalela kumasizini lamatsatfu lendlulile?","The correct answer is **A: Yi-Sevilla**.

The text states: ""Vidal loneminyaka lengu-28 budzala ujoyine licembu le-Barça kuleminyaka lemitsatfu lendlulile, esuka ecenjini le-Sevilla."" which translates to ""Vidal, aged 28, joined the Barça team in the past three years, coming from the Sevilla squad.""
"
Mingakhi imidlalo Vidal layidlala ku-Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Vidal sowudlale imidlalo lengu-49 kulelicembu."" which translates to ""Vidal has played 49 games for the club.""
"
Nguliphi licembu bebadlala nalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Yi-Jarque**.

The text states: ""Jarque bekatilolonga umncintiswano ungakacali eCoverciano eTaliyane ekuseni."" which translates to ""Jarque is participating in a competition in Coverciano, Italy in the morning."" 

The question asks ""Nguliphi licembu bebadlala nalo?"" (Which team is he playing with?). The answer to that is ""Yi-Jarque"" (He is playing for Jarque).
"
Kungani Jarque bekahlala ehhotela?,"The correct answer is **D: Bekatilolonga neBolonia** (They were preparing against Bologna).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bekahlala ehhotela lelicembu ngembikwemdlalo lolungiselelwe ngeLisontfo neBolonia."" This translates to ""He was staying at the team hotel for the match prepared against Lazio and Bologna.""  Therefore, the reason he was staying at the hotel was to prepare for the game against Bologna.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakatilungiselela** (They were preparing) - This is too general. While true, it doesn't specifically state *who* they were preparing for.
* **B: Bekanemhlangano wangembi kwekucala kwesizini** (They had a pre-season meeting) - The passage doesn't mention a pre-season meeting.
* **C: Bekanemdlalo ngeLisontfo** (They had a match against Lazio) - The passage mentions Lazio but also specifically mentions Bologna as the team they were preparing against.
"
Kungani i-ejensi yesayensi yemhlaba yaseJakarta ingazange ikhiphe secwayiso?,"The correct answer is **D: Beyite emandla ladzingekako ekutamatameni kwemhlaba (They didn't detect the unusual strength of the earthquake).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the tsunami warning was issued because the earthquake's strength (6.5) was *unexpected*. This suggests the agency *didn't* initially detect the unusual strength, or perhaps didn't initially recognize it as a tsunami threat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bekute ingoti yetsunami (There was a tsunami buoy):** While tsunami buoys are used for detection, the passage focuses on the *earthquake* being unusual. It doesn't say the buoy failed or didn't detect anything.
* **B: Kugwema kwetfusa takhamuti (To avoid damage to buildings):**  The primary concern in a tsunami warning is public safety, not protecting buildings.
* **C: Kuvikela emabhizinisi endzawo kutsi angatsintseki (To protect local businesses from damage):** Similar to option B, protecting businesses isn't the primary driver of a tsunami warning. Public safety is.



Therefore, the lack of detection of the earthquake's unusual strength is the most logical reason for the delayed warning.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyabangelwa ngulokutamatama kwemhlaba?","The correct answer is **B: Kwaba nengoti yetsunami**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the tsunami warning was issued *because* of the earthquake.
* The warning led to people evacuating. This is a direct consequence of the potential tsunami.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bantfu bendzawo betfuka (Local people evacuated):** While true, this is a *result* of the earthquake and warning, not the direct cause.
* **C: Kwakhishwa secwayiso (A warning was issued):** The warning was issued *because* of the earthquake, not as the cause.
* **D: Kwakunemandla langu-6.5 ngekwesikali (There was a magnitude 6.5 earthquake):** The earthquake is the *cause* that led to the tsunami warning. The warning is the consequence of the earthquake's potential to generate a tsunami.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokubangela kutsi kwenteke lokutsite elangeni nakuto tonkhe tinkhanyeti?,"The correct answer is **B: Inombolo ye-rossy, kutungeleta, nekujika kwatibutse**.

Here's why:

The question states that the aurora (and other types of light) are caused by the interaction of charged particles with the Earth's atmosphere. The passage also mentions that the intensity of the light and the degree of distortion are related to the Rossby number of the magnetosphere, which in turn is related to plasma turbulence.  The passage explicitly links turbulence and the Rossby number to the aurora. While light and turbulence are both involved, the Rossby number is a key factor in determining the aurora's characteristics.  The passage also mentions the Earth's magnetic field's rotation which is essential to the process.

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kukhanya nekugeleta kwe-plasma** - While light and plasma turbulence are part of the process, this doesn't fully capture the complexity described in the passage. The Rossby number is a crucial link.
*   **C: Kutungeleta kanye nekukhanya** -  Again, missing the important connection to the Rossby number.
*   **D: Kukhanya, inombolo ye-rossby, nekujikeleta** - This is the most accurate, encompassing all the mentioned factors contributing to the aurora.



"
Inombolo ye-Rossby yenkhanyeti incunywa kanjani?,"The correct answer is **B: Linani lekugeleta kwe-plasma**.

Here's why:

* The provided text states: ""Kukhanya nekutungeleta kusetjentiswa kanyekanye kutfola inombolo yeRossby yenkhanyeti, lehlobene nekugeleta kwe-plasma.""  This translates to: ""Light and turbulence are used together to determine the Rossby number of the storm, which is related to plasma turbulence.""

Therefore, the Rossby number of a storm is directly related to the intensity of plasma turbulence.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kukhanya nekujikeleta (Light and turbulence):** While light and turbulence *are used* to determine the Rossby number, they are not the Rossby number itself. They are factors *related to* it.
* **C: Lizinga lalokwentekako (The level of occurrence):**  This is too vague and doesn't relate to the scientific connection described in the text.
* **D: Bungako bekujika kwatibutse (The amount of rotation at the vortex):**  While rotation is important in storms, the text specifically links the Rossby number to *plasma turbulence*.



"
Mangakhi emaphesenti ebantfu lokwentiwa kubo luhlolo labasekela kutsi ngekushesha i-Australia ibe live lelinahulumende lotimele?,"The correct answer is **A: Emaphesenti langu-31**.

The passage states: ""kantsi labangephesenti langu 31 bona batsi i-Australia akumele ibe yive lebuswa ngentsandvo yelunyenti."" This translates to ""and 31 percent believed that Australia should not be governed by military rule.""  Therefore, 31% of the voters supported the idea of a swift transition to military rule.
"
"NgekwaJulie Gillard, kunini lapho i-Australia kufanele ibe nahulumende lotimele?","The correct answer is **D: Ngemuva kwelukhetfo**.

The passage states that Julia Gillard believed Australia was only truly governed by the monarch, Queen Elizabeth II.  However, the passage also mentions that a significant portion of voters (29%) wanted a swift move to an elected government. Since elections happen *before* a new government can be formed, the most logical conclusion from the passage is that Gillard believed a government should be formed *after* an election.
"
Nguyiphi inhlangano lengaphansi kweluphenyo?,"The correct answer is **D: The Oversight ne-Investigations Subcommittee**.

Here's why:

The question states that Representative Cliff Stearns conducted an investigation into whether tax funds could be allocated to Planned Parenthood *in his role as a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.*

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: The House Energy ne-Commerce Committee:** While Stearns was part of this committee, the specific subcommittee conducting the investigation is what the question asks about.
*   **B: The Komen Foundation:** The Komen Foundation is the organization mentioned at the beginning of the question as using a new policy, but it's not the organization under investigation.
*   **C: Planned Parenthood:** Planned Parenthood is the organization being investigated for potential misuse of funds, not the entity under investigation itself.



"
Cliff Stearns ungumholi wayiphi ikomidi?,"The correct answer is **A: The House Energy ne-Commerce Committee**.

The text states that Cliff Stearns was a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and served as chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee within that committee. Therefore, the best answer is the full committee name.
"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu saseSwitzerland, yini lengazange yenteke kulomfati waseSwitzerland?","The correct answer is **D: Lucingo lwakhe nangcondvomshini lophatfwako kwebiwa**.

Here's why:

* The text states that police found the Swiss man's phone and laptop. It *doesn't* say he was killed (B), assaulted (C), or that his jewelry was stolen (A). The key point is that his phone and laptop were missing, indicating a theft of his belongings.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that his belongings (phone and laptop) were stolen.
"
Nguyiphi inkapani leyaklonyeliswa nge-Taiwan Sustainable Award nga-2007?,"The correct answer is **C: I-ASUS**.

The text states: ""Kepha libhizinisi lemakhompyutha laphatfwako litokwehluka futsi lishintje ngemuva kwekutsi i-ASUS itfole umklomelo kuyi-2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award levela Kumphatsi weRepublic of China."" This directly indicates that ASUS received the award.
"
Iyini i-ASUS Eee PC?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngcondvomshini lophatfwako (A portable computer)**.

The text states: ""I-ASUS Eee PC, phambilini ikhiphe emanani okonga emhlaba wonkhe kanye netindlela tekusebenta, lokwaba sihloko lesihamba embili seTaipei IT Month yanga-2007.""  This indicates it's a portable computer, designed for portability and different ways of use. While not explicitly defining it, ""ngcondvomshini lophatfwako"" is the most accurate translation for ""portable computer."" The text also highlights its introduction at a technology event, further supporting this.
"
Ngubani labekanesandla ekulahlekeni kwetimphepha teliposi?,"The correct answer is **C: Umfana**.

The text states that ""umfana ufihle tincwadzi tebantfu"" which translates to ""a boy hid people's documents"". This indicates the boy was responsible for the missing documents.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lowacolisa mayelana netimphepha letalahleka?","The correct answer is **A: Tikhamuti tendzawo** (The local police).

The passage states: ""Itoło liposi licolisile esiveni nasemsakatweni ngemuva kwekutfola kutsi umfana ufihle tincwadzi tebantfu..."" This means the police were called to the post office *after* the documents were found, indicating they are the ones investigating the issue.  ""Tikhamuti tendzawo"" translates to local police.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngumfana (The boy):** The boy *hid* the documents, but he isn't the one who reported the issue or was called to investigate.
* **C: Bemsakato (The post office):** The post office was *affected* by the theft, but not the one who alerted authorities.
* **D: Liposi lase-Obanazawa (Obanazawa Post Office):** The post office is the *location* where the issue occurred, not the one who reported it.
"
Kunini lapho Del Potro asingatsa khona inkinga yakhe yelihlombe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngembi kwelikhefu le-tie lekucala**.

Here's why:

The text states that Del Potro had a problem with his wrist *after* the first set was tied 6-6. The question asks *when* he might have had the problem. Therefore, the tiebreaker in the first set is the most likely time.
"
Waba yini umphumela welikhefu le-tie yekucala?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwehlulwa Murray ngesethi yekucala**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Murray wehluleka esigabeni sekucala ngemuva kwekutsi omabili lamadvodza abambane adlala emdlalweni munye."" This translates to ""Murray lost the first set after two tennis players played each other in the match.""

The passage then goes on to describe Del Potro getting injured and returning to the match, and mentions that Potro had a tough time in the second set after the tie. Therefore, Murray won the first set.
"
"Njengobe kushiwo kulesicephu, ngubani ngalokucondzile lowaba nekuhlangana nesigulane?","The correct answer is **A: Umbusi**.

The passage states: ""Perry watsi ngalokucondzile..."" which translates to ""Perry said that he was in charge...""  And Perry is referred to as the Governor of Texas (because it mentions ""takhamuti taseTexas"" - Texas government). Therefore, Perry (the Governor) is the one who convened the meeting regarding the disease.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi sicinisekiso umbusi langazange alisho nakakhuluma netakhamuti taseTexas?","The correct answer is **D: Lenkinga ayisiyinkhulu**

Here's why:

* The passage clearly states, ""Wachubeka watsi, """"Lendzaba lena yinkhulu. Ciniseka kutsi luhlelo lwetfu lusebenta ngendlela lefanele."""" "" which translates to ""He continued saying, """"This is a big concern. Make sure our system is working properly."""""".  This indicates the king *did* consider the issue to be significant.
* The king is concerned about the lack of vaccination in students. He states, ""Namuhla sitfole kutsi bantfwana labasafundza sikolwa bakile batsintsana nalesiguli."" (""Today we have learned that children who are still in school have contracted this disease."").
* The king mentions a plan to meet the demand for vaccines, indicating he *is* taking action.

Therefore, the king did *not* say that the problem was not a big deal. Option D is the only answer that reflects the king's concern about the issue being significant.



"
Ngumuphi umtfombo wetindzaba letihlekisako lowentiwa bafundzi lababili base-UW?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kudzala ngembi kwe-The Daily Show ne-The Colbert Report, Heck naJohnson babone kushicilelwa kwetindzaba—nekubika kwetindzaba—uma basesebafundi e-UW nga-1988. Kusukela lasungulwa, liphephandzaba i-The Onion libe liphephandzaba lelidvumile...""  This directly links The Onion to the students' exposure to satirical news.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokungazange kufakwe etindzabeni letihlekisako lokutsiwa yi-The Onion?","The correct answer is **A: atlas yemhlaba (world atlas)**.

The passage explicitly mentions ""Umhlaba Wetfu Lolibele"" (Our Planet is Doomed) as a recently added feature to The Onion's website, which is essentially an interactive world atlas. The other options are already mentioned as things The Onion *does* have:

*   **B: Lifilimu (Movies):** The passage says The Onion reports on movie reviews.
*   **C: Likhasi le-inthanethi (Web page):** The passage describes The Onion as a website.
*   **D: Luhlelo loluphrintiwe (Print publication):** The passage states The Onion is also a print publication.

Therefore, the only thing *not* mentioned as something The Onion has is an atlas.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lebeyigadvwe maphoyisa?","The correct answer is **C: Lisango le-The Downing Street**.

The passage states: ""ehhovisini laNdvunankhulu"" which translates to ""at the Prime Minister's office"" - referring to Downing Street. The police blocked access to Downing Street.
"
Kungabani sikhatsi lapho emaphoyisa acele khona babhikishi kutsi bahambe kuze kugwenywe kutsi phindze kugcwale timoti?,"The correct answer is **D: Nga-11:20**.

The text states: ""Ng-11:20, liphoyisa licele babhikishi kutsi basuke bame endleleni yekuhamba abantfu, atsi kumele balinganise lilungelo labo lekubhikisha nesiminyaminya setimoto lesakhekako."" This translates to: ""At 11:20, the police asked the protesters to move out of the road, stating that they needed to balance their right to protest with the movement of emergency vehicles.""

Therefore, the police requested the protesters to move at approximately 11:20.
"
Ngukuphi lokuliciniso mayelana nelucwaningo lolwentiwa nguDokotela Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Lamanye emagundvwane labekanesifo sashukela sekete lesifo.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Nyalo sesinemagundvwane lanetinyanga letine budzala lasekete shukela labekanawo shukela"" which translates to ""We already have a group of patients with gestational diabetes who had gestational diabetes."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imiphumela ingase ibazuzise bantfu lebebavele banesifo sashukela lesiLuhlobo 1:** The text explicitly says gestational diabetes *cannot* be cured, and the findings are *not* related to Type 1 diabetes.
* **C: Unelitsemba lekutsi imiphumela ingase iholele ekhambini:** While research *can* lead to breakthroughs, the text doesn't express hope for a cure or treatment in this specific instance. It's more focused on the findings themselves.
* **D: Lamanye emagundvwane labekete sifo sashukela sekanaso:** The phrase ""sekanaso"" isn't clear. Furthermore, the text only refers to patients *with* gestational diabetes, not a specific percentage *of* patients.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini Dokotela Ur lanekungabata ngayo?","The correct answer is **A: Kutsi lemiphumela iyasebenta yini kubantfu labanesifo sashukela lesiLuhlobo 1**.

The text explicitly states: ""...abetsembi kahle kutsi sifo sashukela singelashwa, kucaphela kutsi lokutfoliwe akuhlobani nebantfu lasebane Neluhlobo 1 lwesifo sashukela.""  This means Dr. Ur was discussing whether the findings of the study would be applicable to people with Type 1 diabetes.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kutsi likhambi likhona:** While the text mentions diabetes is incurable, it doesn't directly state that a cure *doesn't* exist. It focuses on the applicability of *this* study's findings.
* **C: Imibono yalabanye bocwepheshe mayelana nelikhambi:** The text doesn't discuss other experts' opinions on a cure.
* **D: Kutsi emagundvwane lete sifo sashukela atohlala ete yini:** The text discusses the *effectiveness* of the findings, not the long-term behavior of the granules themselves.



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langakuchazi kahle kuphahlateka kweNdiza CG4684?,"The correct answer is **D: Imetamo yekutfola lapho lendiza iphahlatekele khona yaphazanyiswa simo selitulu.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the Twin Otter was parked at Kokoda store as PNG Flight CG4684, but had been stationary for about 10 minutes before the second engine started. This suggests an issue related to the engines themselves.
* The passage also mentions the ""problematic engine"" and its ""poor idling.""
* Option D directly connects the engine problem to a potential issue with the propeller (implied by ""metamo yekutfola,"" which translates to propeller) being damaged during the incident. 
* While options A, B, and C are possible consequences, D is the most direct link provided in the text between the engine issue and a potential physical problem with the aircraft.

Therefore, D is the most logical inference based on the information given."
Yini leyabangela Indiza CG4684 kutsi iyekele kuhlala?,"The best answer is **D: Simo selitulu besisibi (Poor structural condition)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Lolucwaningo luphatanyiswe ngulesimo selitulu lesingasisihle lesiphatamise nalokuhlala kwendiza."" This directly links the aircraft's poor structural condition to the reason for its grounding.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Bekungangeneki endzaweni lakufanele ihlale khona (It was not supposed to be in the correct location):** While location could be a factor, the text focuses on the *condition* of the aircraft.
* **B: Bekunaletinye tindiza letinyenti ngembi kwe-CG4684 (Other aircraft were in worse condition than CG4684):** The text doesn't provide any information about other aircraft.
* **C: Lendiza yaphambukiswa yayiswa eKokoda (The aircraft was damaged and flown to Kokoda):** The text says the aircraft *arrived* in Kokoda, but doesn't confirm it was damaged *before* arriving. The focus is on the condition *after* arrival.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the provided text."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako laliciniso mayelana nalokwehlela Franciszek Kowal?","The correct answer is **D: Walimanala lapho etama kwephula lifasitelo.**

Here's why:

The quote states: ""...Lelinye lalamafasitela lagcina liphukile, futsi bacala kuphuma ngalelifasitelo."" ( ""...One of the windows eventually broke, and they managed to get out through that window."")

This clearly indicates that Franciszek Kowal was injured (""walimanala"") while trying to break through a window to escape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wakhona kwephula lifasitelo:** While he *tried* to escape through a window, the quote doesn't say he actually *succeeded* in jumping through it.
* **B: Akazange alimale:** The quote explicitly says he *did* get injured.
* **C: Wephula situlu lapho etama kuphuma:** The quote states they *broke* the window with their heads, not that he jumped through a hole in the ceiling.



"
Kungani kumatima kukala umonakala longabangwa Siphepho Lokutsiwa Ngu-Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Lesiphepho sikhashane nekufika emhlabeni.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngendlela lesiphepho sikhashane nekuwa kwemhlabatsi, kuhlala kumantima kubona umonakalo lowentekile eMelika noma eCaribbean.""  This directly translates to ""Because the storm is short and approaching land, there is always the potential for damage in the US or the Caribbean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutsiwa lesiphepho sitawucina sibe sivunguvungu lesinemandla** (Because the storm will intensify into a stronger storm): While storm intensification *can* increase damage, the passage specifically links the potential for damage to the storm's proximity to land.
*   **B: Bososayensi abaciniseki ngemoya walesiphepho** (Because scientists have underestimated the storm's wind): The passage doesn't mention scientists underestimating the wind.
*   **D: Lesiphepho sikhashane kakhulu neMiami** (The storm is very short near Miami): The passage says the storm is approaching land, not specifically near Miami. While Miami is mentioned as a starting point, the general proximity to land is the key factor.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana neSiphepho Lokutsiwa Ngu-Danielle?","The correct answer is **B: Sakheka eLwandle I-Atlantic**.

The text explicitly states: ""Siphepho, lebesisendzaweni lechele ngemamayela langaba ngu-3,000 nawusuka eMiami, eFlorida, besinemoya logijima ngesivinini sa-40 mph (64 kph).""  This means it formed in the Atlantic Ocean.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umonakala wase e-Caribbean awatiwa:** The text says scientists *think* Danielle will turn into a hurricane, implying a potential for damage. It doesn't state that damage to the Caribbean is *not* expected.
* **C: Singashintja sibe sivunguvungu lesinemandla:** The text states scientists believe it will *turn into a hurricane* (""utawucina abe siphepho""), not a typhoon.
* **D: Sisedvute nekufika emhlabeni:** The text mentions it's close to land, but it doesn't say it has already made landfall.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokunconywa kutsi yenteke ngaleligciwane ngembi kwekutsi libe lubhubhane lwemhlaba wonkhe?","The correct answer is **A: Kufanele anciphe emandla alo ekubulala** (It should be weakened in its ability to kill).

Here's why:

The passage states that research suggests the virus *could* be drastically weakened, preventing a global pandemic.  This implies that the danger lies in the virus's potential to cause severe illness and spread.  Weakening its virulence (ability to cause harm) would mitigate that risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Timphawu kufanele ahlale angabi nemandla** (The symptoms should remain mild):  While mild symptoms are preferable, the concern isn't just about symptoms; it's about the virus's ability to spread and cause serious illness.
*   **C: Kufanele libambe bantfu labanyenti** (Many people should be quarantined): Quarantine is a measure to *control* the spread, not necessarily to weaken the virus itself.  It's a reactive measure.
*   **D: Bantfwana kufanele babe netimphawu talo** (Children should have its symptoms): This is not a solution to prevent a pandemic.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, lesishingishane sikhashane kangakanani neFujian?","The correct answer is **D: Emakhilomitha langu-77**

Here's why:

The question states: ""Lesiphepho kucatjangwa kutsi siya eShayina nga-11 kph."" This translates to ""The plane is said to be going to China at 11 km/h."" The initial part of the question states ""Kusukela ngebusuku bamhlaka-9 iNgci, liso laMokarat belichele cishe ngemakhilomitha langemashumi lasikhombisa kusuka esifundzeni saseShayina iFujian."" which translates to ""Since the night of the 9th of June, the radar has said it is approximately tens of kilometers from the Fujian province of China.""

Combining this, the plane has traveled 11 km/h for approximately tens of kilometers, resulting in a total distance of about 77 km (11 km/h * approximately 7 km). Therefore, 77km is the closest option.
"
Ngubani lowabingelela George W. Bush nakefika e-Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng naLee Hsien Loong**.

The passage states: ""Wavuselwa Lisekela laNdvunankhulu waseSingapore Wong Kan Seng futsi bacocisana ngetindzaba tekutsengiselana netebuphekula naNdvunankhulu waseSingapore Lee Hsien Loong."" This means George W. Bush was greeted by both Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong.
"
Mengameli ukhulume nini ngekwandza kwetekutsengiselana kwe-Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Kulandzela kwehluleka kwakhe elukhetfweni lwasekhatsi nemnyaka.**

The passage states: ""Ngemuva kweliviki ehlulekile elukhetfweni, Bush utjele labebamlalele ngekwenwetjwa kwetentsengiselwano e-Asia."" This indicates he spoke about the Asia trade initiative *after* the election results.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungumgomo wahulumende?","The correct answer is **C: Kutfola tinkalishi letengetiwe letingu-1,300**.

Here's why:

The question states that 300 people are allowed to register and that this number is capped at 1,300. Therefore, the next government goal, based on the information provided, is to **allocate 1,300 permits**.  The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
Yini lemenyetelwe nguhulumende?,"The correct answer is **B: Batimisele kutsi balungise inkinga yetinkalishi.**

Here's why:

* The text states the government has promised to pay for the purchase of firewood.
* It also mentions a limit of 300 people per household and a total budget of 1,300.
* This indicates the government is trying to address the problem of firewood scarcity and affordability. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Luhlelo lwekuchasa ngetinkalishi letengetiwe letingu-300** - This is incorrect. The text isn't about a ""campaign against firewood sellers"" but about helping people *buy* firewood.
* **C: Bahlela kuchasa ngetinkalishi letengetiwe letingu-1,300** - This is also incorrect. The government is *paying* for firewood, not campaigning against sellers with a budget of 1,300.
* **D: Inkinga yekugcwala kakhulu itawulungiswa angakendluli March** - This is not supported by the provided text. The text focuses on firewood and not a general ""overcrowding"" issue.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwatiswa lokwatiwako?","The correct answer is **A: Lizinga lengoti selincishisiwe (The level of the threat has decreased)**.

Here's why:

The phrase ""Lokuncipha kwalelizinga lalesisongo"" directly translates to ""The decrease in the level of this threat."" The sentence is stating that while the threat level is lower, it doesn't mean the threat is gone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sekute ingoti (It's already gold/safe)** - This is the opposite of what the sentence is saying.
* **C: Kulindzeleke kuhlasela (An attack is expected)** - The sentence says an attack *might* happen quickly, but the *threat level* is what's being addressed.
* **D: Betebunhloli bakucinisekisile kutsi kuhlasela kutawuba kubi kakhulu (Investigators have confirmed that the attack will be very bad)** - The sentence doesn't mention the severity of a potential attack, only the threat level.



"
Ngumaphi emavi langasilo liciniso mayelana nemibhikisho?,"The correct answer is **C: Lemibhikisho beyifuna kutsi i-CEP yangaphambilini isule.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Lokubhikisha lokuneludlame kubangelwe kwehluleka kubamba lukhetfo, lolunye lobekufanele lube khona nga-2011. **Lemibhikisho beyifuna kutsi i-CEP yangaphambilini isule**.""  This directly indicates the reason for the protests was dissatisfaction with the previous CEP.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ikhomishane yebungameli ibe yimphendulo emibhikishweni:** The passage says the *commission of presidents* *responded to* the protests, not that the commission *was* the protest.
* **B: Lukhetfo lebelusolo lungenteki lubangele lemibhikisho:** The passage explicitly states that the failure to hold the election in 2011 *caused* the protests.
* **D: Lemibhikisho beyineludlame ngaletinye tikhatsi:** While the passage mentions *one* violent protest, it doesn't say protests *always* involved violence.

Therefore, option C is the only one accurately reflected in the provided text."
Ngubani lowancoma kutsi i-CEP legcinile yesule?,"The correct answer is **A: Martelly**.

The text states: ""Itolo Martelly ufungiswe kulensha i-Provisional Electoral Council (CEP). Lecouncil inemalunga layimfica. Sikhatsi sesihlanu e-CEP saMartelly eminyakeni lemine."" This indicates that Martelly is the one who questioned or challenged the CEP. The later part of the text explains the context of this challenge, related to the election and the failed 2011 election, implying Martelly is the one advocating for change or questioning the council's actions.
"
"Ngekwalamavi, yini lengasekelwa yi-USA Gymnastics kulandzela kuhlukunyetwa kwebasubatsi nguNassar?","The correct answer is **C: Lushintjo loludzingekako ngekhatsi kwalenhlangano.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""BeTekujima eMelika basekela luphenyo lolutimele lelingakhanyisa kutsi kuhlukubeteka kwalendlela lechazwe nguletisulu taLarry Nassar ngabe akubonwanga sikhatsi lesidze kangaka futsi iyalamukela noma ngabe nguluphi lushintjo lolufanele naloludzingekako.""

This directly translates to supporting necessary changes within the organization. Options A and B are not mentioned in the text. While a ""D: Luphenyo lolutimele"" is mentioned, the text emphasizes that they will *accept* whatever necessary changes the investigation reveals. Therefore, the overarching support is for changes within the organization itself.
"
"Ngekwalamavi, uyini umgomo loyinhloko we-USA Gymnastics ne-United States Olympic Committee kuya phambili?","The correct answer is **D: Kukhutsata ktusi kube nesimo lesiphephile kubasubatsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that BeTekujima eMelika and USOC are working together to ensure a safe environment for athletes so they can achieve their dreams. They explicitly mention supporting an independent investigation into the handling of Larry Nassar's abuse and welcoming any necessary changes. This all points to a priority on athlete safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuveta kuhlukumeta lokwentiwa ngu-Larry Nassar:** While they support the investigation into Nassar, it's not the *primary* goal going forward.
*   **B: Kutsatsa tinyatselo tekusula sitifiketi:** This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Kutsatsa tinyatselo teluphenyo lolutimele:** They support the independent investigation, but the focus is on the outcome – creating a safer environment.



"
Lomkhumbi bewulibhekise kuphi ngesikhatsi kwenteka lesehlakalo? ,"The correct answer is **C: EPalawan**.

The text states: ""...lomkhumbi bowusendleleni yawo uya e-Puerto Princesa in Palawan."" This means the ship was on its way to Palawan when the incident occurred.
"
Ngukuphi lokungasilo liciniso mayelana nalomkhumbu lokukhulunywe ngawo kulesicephu?,"The correct answer is **A: Bewulibangise ePuerto Princesa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""umkhumbi bowusendleleni yawo uya e-Puerto Princesa in Palawan."" This means the ship *was on its way to* Puerto Princesa, not that it *arrived in* Puerto Princesa.  Therefore, the statement ""Bewulibangise ePuerto Princesa"" (It arrived in Puerto Princesa) is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **B: Utinte ePalawan** - The text says it's docked in Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan.  While Palawan is mentioned as a destination, the ship is not docked there.
* **C: Ngumkhumbi lobitwa ngekutsi yi-mine countermeasures ship** - The text states, ""Umphindziseli usebentisa tindlela tekulwa kuze alwe nemkhumbi,"" and also states the ship is being investigated for gold. While not explicitly stated, the phrase ""mine countermeasures ship"" aligns with the actions of dealing with a submerged object.
* **D: Wabelwe i Seventh Fleet ye U.S. Navy** - The text explicitly states, ""Yabelwe e-U.S Navy's Seventh Fleet.""



Therefore, the only definitively incorrect statement is that the ship arrived in Puerto Princesa.



"
Ngubani lowasho lamavi mayelana nemasotja aseMelika?,"The correct answer is **A: NguDonald Trump**. 

The text explicitly states: ""NgeLisontfo ntsambama, mengameli waseMelika Donald Trump, esitatimendeni lasetfule ngamabhalane wemaphepha..."" which translates to ""Last night, US President Donald Trump, in a statement released by the press...""
"
"Ngekwalamavi, nguliphi live lelitsetse umsebenti wekugadza titfunjwa letilwako?","The correct answer is **A: ISyria**.

The text states that the US troops will be withdrawn *from Syria*. It also mentions the potential movement of ISIS fighters *from Syria* back to Europe. Therefore, Syria is the location where the activity related to the issue is taking place.
"
Yini lokukholelwa kutsi iyimbangela yalengoti?,"The correct answer is **B: Umlilo lonemandla**.

The text explicitly states: ""futsi kukholelwa kutsi ibangelwe ngumlilo lonemandla."" which translates to ""and it is believed to be caused by a powerful fire.""
"
Ingoti yenteke kuluphi luhlobo lwendzawo?,"The correct answer is **D: Lenetintsaba (Mountainous)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lengoti yenteke etulu emgwaceni losentsabeni..."" which translates to ""The landslide occurred in a mountainous area...""
"
Yini tikhulu letinelitsemba layo njengemphumela wetikhukhula?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubuyiselwa kwendvundvuma yesihlabatsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngisho noma lizinga lemanti litawukhula nemafidi lambalwa ngemuva kwaletikhukhula, tiphatsimandla tetsemba kutsi atawuba ngulenele kubuyisela **sihlabatsi lesikhukhulekile entasi nemfula**.""  This directly translates to a hope for the return of a healthy ecosystem in the river.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kwakhiwa kwemabhishi:** While the construction of dams *does* create a habitat for fish, the passage focuses on the negative impacts of the dam and the *hope* for restoration, not the creation of new habitat.
*   **C: Linani lelikhulako lema-humpback chubs:** The passage mentions the decline of humpback chubs, not a hope for their increase.
*   **D: Tindzawo letengetiwe tetilwane tasendle:** The passage discusses the loss of habitat for animals but doesn't link the dam removal specifically to creating new animal habitats. The primary focus is on the fish population and ecosystem.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokwatsintfwa unomphela kwakhiwa kwelidamu?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindvundvuma tesihlabatsi (Fish populations)**.

The passage explicitly states that as a result of the dam construction, two types of fish have disappeared, and others are endangered, including the humpback chub. The hope is to restore the fish populations to a healthy state.  Therefore, the consequences directly affect the fish populations.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lowacwayisa i-United States ngekuhlalelwa lokungase kwenteke?","The correct answer is **C: Ngumtfombo longatiwa (An unnamed source)**.

The text states: ""I-U.S. itsi itfole umbiko kubantfu labangakashiwo lokhuluma ngalokucacile ngekusetjentiswa kwemabhomu latawuchunyiswa """"kubantfu labatiwako"""" eTopiya naseKenya.""  This means the U.S. received the warning from an *unnamed* source.
"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lalichaza kahle lichinga labontsamolukhuni lekuhlasela lokusolwa kutsi likhona?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuchumisa emabhomu emaveni lamabili**

Here's why:

* The text states that the US warning concerns a plot to bomb **both** Kenya **and** Ethiopia. 
* Options A and D only mention one country.
* Option C is a duplicate of Option B.



"
Ngumuphi kulabantfu labalandzelako longasiye ummeli?,"The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngetulu kwaloko, lijaji lelikhulu Evangelos Kalousis liboshiwe ngekutfolwa linelicala lenkhohlakalo nekutiphatsa kabi.  **Lihlisa kwalokho, lijaji lelikhulu Evangelos Kalousis liboshiwe ngekutfolwa linelicala lenkhohlakalo nekutiphatsa kabi.**""

And it also states: ""Ngekuva kwekwatiswa lokukhishwe yintsatseli lenguMakis Triantafylopoulos eluhlelweni lwakhe loludvumile kuThelevishini lelitsi """"Zoungla"""" ku-Alpha TV, lijunga lePhalemende nemmeli, **Petros Mantouvalos wehlisiwe esikhundleni njengemalunga elihhovisi lakhe abhandzakanyeke ekwenteni tintfo letingekho emtsetfweni nasekukhwabaniseni.**""

Therefore, Petros Mantouvalos is the one who was removed from his position.
"
Nguliphi licembu lebantfu lelingabalwa njengencenye yelihlazo lelikhona kubetemtsetfo baseGreece?,"The correct answer is **B: Emajaji (Judges)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Judge Evangelos Kalousis was arrested for corruption and abuse of power. This directly implicates judges in the corruption scandal.
* While lawyers (Beluleki betemtsetfo) and journalists (Tintsatseli) *might* be involved, the text focuses on the arrest of a judge as a key part of the legal system's problems.
* ""Bameli"" (Bailiffs/bail bonders) are mentioned as being part of the scheme, but the text doesn't frame them as the central problem within the legal system itself.

Therefore, the arrest of judges is a direct and prominent example of the corruption within the Greek legal system described in the text.



"
INdiya ilahlekelwe mawikhethi lamangakhi?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**

The passage states: ""...walahlekelwa ema-wickets langu-7 ngasekupheleni kwema-innings."" This translates to ""...lost 7 wickets at the end of the innings.""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, bekangakanani emaphuzu lasetulu ema-innings?","The correct answer is **A: Ema-runs langu-70**

The question asks for the total runs Robin Uthappa scored in his innings. The passage states: ""Robin Uthappa went in the innings and scored a langu-70...""  Therefore, the answer is 70.
"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungasiyo imbangela yekukhungatseka kwa-Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **D: Emanga mayelana nembangela yekususwa kwalobuciko**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the reason for Adam Cuerden's upset was that Wales *claimed* the removal was due to a misunderstanding about the content being non-conformist and then *pretended* to listen before the removal went through. 
* Option D, ""Emanga mayelana nembangela yekususwa kwalobuciko"" (Claims about the reason for the removal of the artwork), directly addresses the false narrative Wales presented, which is the core of Cuerden's complaint.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umgomo lomusha wesayithi lomayelana netintfo letitsintsa tasecansini** (New site rules regarding sexually explicit content) - While the removal was likely due to site rules, the text doesn't say this was *the* reason for Cuerden's anger. He was angry about the *way* it was handled.
* **B: Kususwa kwebuciko baseWales** (Removal of Welsh artwork) - This is simply a statement of fact – the artwork was removed. Cuerden's issue isn't *that* the artwork was removed, but *how* the removal happened.
* **C: Kungalalelwa yiWales** (Wales not being listened to) - This is a consequence of the situation, not the initial cause of the upset. Cuerden felt Wales was dishonest and didn't genuinely try to understand before acting.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyasuswa kulesayithi?","The correct answer is **A: Buciko**. 

The text states: ""Kwekucala, ngekwenta ngatsi loku bekungenca yetizatfu letingekwemtsetfo. Kwesibili, ngekwenta ngatsi uyasilalela, kuchubeke kuze kube kukhokhwa kwakhe ebucikweni."" This translates to: ""Firstly, by pretending it was a non-criminal matter. Secondly, by pretending to listen, until his artwork was paid for.""  This clearly indicates that the artwork (buciko) was removed.

While the text discusses the subject matter *of* the artwork (people involved in scandals/affairs), the question asks what was *removed* from the site.  The answer is the artwork itself.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako Amir Khan langakusekeli?","The correct answer is **A: Kufaka labasikati labalwako kuma-Olimpiki**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngekhatsi ngicabanga kutsi bantfu besimame akukafaneli balwe. Ngumbono wami lowo."" (When I think that standing people should not fight. That’s my opinion.) This directly relates to his opposition to boxing being included in the Olympics.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokutawusekelwa ngu-Amir Khan ngisho nangetulu kwemibono yakhe?","The correct answer is **C: Ema-Olimpiki a-2012**.

The passage states: ""Ngaphandle kwekuphawula kwakhe utse utakwesekela labangenele umcintiswano waseBritish emidlalweni yanga-2012 wema-Olemphikhi letobanjelwa eLondon.""  This translates to: ""Without comment, he said he was looking forward to the British competition at the 2012 Olympic Games to be held in London.""
"
Peter Lenz wafa nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngemuva kwekuwa esidududwini**.

The passage states: ""Peter Lenz, umgijimi wemcintiswano wetidududu lona-13, ufile ngemuva kwekuba sengotini e-Indianaposis Motor Speedway. Ngesikhatsi asatishisisa umtimba, Lenz uwile kulelibhayisikili lakhe, wase ushayiswa nguloyo lacudzelana naye lokunguXavier Zayat. Ngekushesha watfola lusito kuletisebenti tetemphilo letinakako futsi wamikiswa esibhedlela sendzawo lapho afela khona ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi.""

This translates to: ""Peter Lenz, a rookie racer in the IndyCar series, died after a crash at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. While practicing, Lenz crashed his bike and was hit by a competing racer, Xavier Zayat. He quickly received first aid and was taken to a local hospital where he died later.""

Therefore, he died *after* the crash.



"
Ngubani Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngulomunye losemcudzelwaneni** (He is another racer).

The text states: ""...wase ushayiswa nguloyo lacudzelana naye lokunguXavier Zayat."" This directly indicates that Xavier Zayat is a fellow racer.
"
Kukusiphi simo lapho umgibeli wendiza lowesabako kungenteka khona kutsi azuze ngekucondza indlela indiza lesebenta ngayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Nangabe kwesaba kwakhe kundiza kubangelwa kwesaba lokungatiwa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights that fear of flying is often rooted in the unknown.** The text explicitly states, ""...kucondza lokutsite ngendlela tindiza letisebenta ngayo nekutsi kwentekani nawusendizeni kungabasita bancobe kwesaba lokusekelwe etintfweni labangatati noma nasekwehlulekeni kucondzisa tintfo."" This means fear stems from not understanding how planes work or what happens during a flight.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Nangabe lomgibeli anemahloni ngekwesaba kwakhe:** While fear *can* be a factor, the passage doesn't focus on the pilot's personal fear. It's more about the fear *induced* in passengers.
* **C: Nangabe umgibeli angahambisani nato tonkhe tinhlobo tetekutfutsa:** A pilot's ability to handle different types of aircraft is a core requirement, but not directly related to the fear of flying in passengers.
* **D: Nangabe kwesaba kwakhe kuyimbangela yetintfo letibuhlungu letingahlobene nekundiza:** While emotional trauma can exist, the passage focuses on the more generalized fear of the unknown aspects of flying.



Therefore, option B aligns most closely with the passage's emphasis on fear of the unknown as a key driver of fear of flying.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako umuntfu lohambako lokhatsateka kakhulu ngemali lokufanele ayente ekugcineni?","The correct answer is **C: Kucatsanisa imali etinkapanini letehlukahlukene tekuhamba.**

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** The person is concerned about the price and finds that the price of the same flight can vary greatly.
* **The text suggests:**  To find the best price, the person needs to compare prices from *different* airlines and travel companies.
* **Option C directly addresses this:**  ""Kucatsanisa imali etinkapanini letehlukahlukene tekuhamba"" translates to ""Compare prices at different travel companies.""  This is the logical next step to ensure they get the cheapest fare.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kuhlola lokuniketwa tinkapani letehlukahlukene tekuhamba** (Check the offers of different travel companies) - This is a good *starting* point, but doesn't guarantee the best price.  You still need to compare those offers.
* **B: Kubhuka ngalokucondzile nenkapani yetindiza** (Book directly with the airline and travel company) -  Booking directly *might* be cheaper, but the text highlights price differences between airlines, so comparing is essential.
* **D: Kuhlola likhasi le-inthanethi lenkampani yetindiza** (Check the airline's website) -  This is a specific website check and doesn't cover comparing across different providers.



Therefore, **C** is the most comprehensive and accurate answer based on the information provided."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini bantfu labahambako lokufanele bayente kucala kuze batfole emanani lancono etindiza nakungenteka?","The correct answer is **B: Kucatsanisa emanani kumakhasi e-inthanethi lehlukene**.

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Ngalesinye sikhatsi indiza lefanako ingabe nemanani lahlukene kakhulu ngako kuyasita kucatsanisa imiphumela nekubuka iwebusayithi yetindizamshini nawubhukhile."" (Sometimes the same flight can have very different prices. It helps to compare results and check airline websites and book.)
* **This implies:**  The price of a flight can vary between different websites and airlines.  Therefore, comparing prices across multiple websites is the best way to find the best deal.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kuhlola likhasi le-inthanethi lenkampani yetindiza** (Check the airline's website): While checking the airline's website is good, it doesn't guarantee you'll find the lowest price. Comparing with other sites is crucial.
* **C: Kubhuka ngalokucondzile enkapanini yetindiza** (Book directly with the airline): Booking directly *can* sometimes be cheaper, but not always.  It's still worth comparing.
* **D: Kubhuka ngalokucondzile enkapanini yekuhamba** (Book directly with a travel agency): Travel agencies might offer packages, but they aren't necessarily the cheapest option for just a flight.



Therefore, **B** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the information given."
Kunini lapho kudzingeka khona kutsi umngani ahambe nentfo lemikiswako?,"The correct answer is **C: Nangabe tintfo titfunyelwa njengemitfwalo lehloliwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Imitsetfo yetindiza angeke ibavume kutsi batfumele liputumende angekho umnikati walo, kulapho-ke wena lawungena khona."" This means that to ship items via air, they need to be treated as inspected cargo.  The only way to do that is to have a shipper (the person with the legal right to ship).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nangabe tintfo titfunyelwa ngendiza:** While it *can* be shipped by air, the passage focuses on the *method* of shipping (inspected cargo) rather than simply the mode of transport.
* **B: Nangabe lenkapani isebentisa tindiza tayo:** The passage mentions large companies having their own fleet, but it's not the core issue. The problem is the lack of a shipper, regardless of the company's size.
* **D: Nangabe lentfo itfunyelwa ngenkapani lenkhulu:** Similar to B, the size of the company isn't the key point. The need for a shipper exists regardless of company size.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the situation described in the passage."
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, nawukhetsa Luhlelo Lwalabandiza Njalo kumfelandzawonye, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokufanele kuhambe embili?","The correct answer is **D: Inkapani yetindiza lengase ifake emalungelo lengetiwe**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that even if a frequent flyer program seems beneficial, the benefits (like lounge access and other perks) can vary significantly between airlines *within the same alliance*.  Therefore, the next step is to consider which airline *might offer the best benefits* given your travel habits and the specific alliance you are considering. You need to look into which airline is more likely to provide the perks you value.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Inkapani yetindiza leniketa emaphoyini lamanyenti:** While earning points is important, the passage focuses on *benefits*, not just points accumulation.
*   **B: Inkapani yetindiza lenemfelandzawonye lomkhulu:** While important for alliance benefits, it doesn't directly address which airline *within* the alliance will offer the best perks.
*   **C: Inkapani yetindiza sikhatsi lesinyenti loyisebentisako:** Frequency of use is relevant, but again, the passage is focused on the specific *benefits* offered by each airline.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi inkapani lengase inikete emaphoyinti alabandiza njalo?","The correct answer is **D: Inkapani leyehlukile kumfelandzawonye lofanako**.

Here's why:

The passage states that even if you join an airline alliance, your benefits can vary and the number of lounge access points can be limited compared to airlines outside the alliance.  Therefore, airlines *outside* the alliance are the ones most likely to have a limited number of lounge access points within the alliance.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumuphi kulemiva lelandzelako longase ukhinyabetwe kunatsa kakhulu tjwala?","The correct answer is **C: Kunambitsa**.

The text states: ""Tinkinga temphilo lokungenteka ube nato sikhatsi lesidze nawunatsa tjwala kakhulu tingafaka ekhatsi konakala kwesibindzi ngisho nekungaboni emehlweni nekufa."" This translates to: ""Health problems that can occur when you drink too much alcohol can lead to liver damage, even blindness and death.""  

Therefore, **kunambitsa** (to vomit) is a consequence of drinking too much alcohol, aligning with the information provided. The other options don't directly relate to the health consequences described in the text.
"
"Njengobe kushiwo kulesicephu, yini lokungenteka inciphise bungoti tjwala lobunato?","The correct answer is **A: Kunatsa tjwala lobune-methanol**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Emaspirithi langekho emtsetfweni angafaka ekhatsi kungcola lokuningi lokuyingoti lokufaka ekhatsi imethanol, lengabangela bumphumphutse noma ngisho nekufa ngisho kufakwe kancane.""  This means methanol is a dangerous contaminant in unregulated alcohol. The passage also mentions that alcohol that is not regulated can contain dangerous substances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kunatsa timehlane letentiwe ngalokungekho emtsetfweni:** While unregulated alcohol can contain other dangerous substances, the passage specifically highlights methanol as a major concern.
* **C: Kunatsa tjwala ngalokusesilinganisweni:** The passage warns about the dangers of drinking *too much* alcohol, regardless of whether it's regulated or not.  Drinking in moderation isn't directly linked to the specific dangers outlined in the passage.
* **D: Kunatsa nebantfu labahlukahlukene:** This option is irrelevant to the dangers of alcohol poisoning.



"
Kukuphi lapho emanani etindzawo aphakeme kakhulu khona e-Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Sifundza SaseCanal**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sifundza saseCanal (iDutch: Grachtengordel) isigodzi sengelikhulu lesi-17 leminyaka lesidvumile lesitungelete iBinnenstad yase-Amsterdam. **Sonkhe lesigodzi sihlelwe njenge-UNESCO Indzawo Yetintfo Temasiko Emhlabeni**..."" 

This means the Canal Ring itself is the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Therefore, the highest concentrations of places are found within the Canal Ring.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kunome nguyiphi indzawo lekhetfwe kutsi ibe Yindzawo Yemagugu Emhlaba Ye-UNESCO:** While true, this is too general. It doesn't specify *where* these places are located.
*   **C: Tindzawo letisusiwe ku-Binnenstad:** This is incorrect. The Canal Ring *is* the Binnenstad.
*   **D: Tindzawo letinekubaluleka kwemlandvo:**  This is true of the Canal Ring, but not the *most* accurate answer to the question of *where* the highest concentrations are.



"
Kungani Sifundza SeCanal sikhetfwe ktusi sibe Yindzawo Yemagugu Emhlaba Ye-UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **B: Tindzawo tayo letehlukile (Its unique features)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sonkhe lesigodzi sihlelwe njenge-UNESCO Indzawo Yetintfo Temasiko Emhlabeni ngenca yekwehluka kwaso ngekwemasiko nangekwemlandvo"" which translates to ""The entire canal belt is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its unique cultural and historical significance.""

While the other options are related, they aren't the *primary* reason given in the text. The uniqueness of the features (canal system and historic buildings) is the core reason for the UNESCO designation.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokwenta kuvakashela i-Phnom Krom kube ngulokuzuzisako?","The correct answer is **A: Kubona i-Tonle Sap**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lesimo lesidzabukisako salelithempeli nalokubukela lesichibi iTonle Sap kwenta lokucanca lelidvwala kube ngulokudzingekile."" (The scenic location of this temple and the view of the Tonle Sap Lake make visiting it particularly special.) It also mentions taking a boat trip on the lake.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini ledzingekako kulabavakashile kuze bangene e-Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Kutfola i-Angkor Pass**.

The passage states: ""I-Angkor Pass iyadzingeka kungena kulelithempeli ngako ungakhohlwa kuta nepasipoti yakho uma uta eTonle Sap.""  This directly indicates that an Angkor Pass is required to enter Phnom Krom.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungavimbela sivakashi kutsi sivakashele i-Antarctica?","The correct answer is **D: Lizinga lelilinganiselwe lekuhamba (The level of physical fitness)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kuvasha kwetivakashi takulamanye emave kuyadula, kudzinga kutsi ube nemandla ngokwemtimba, kungenteka kuphela ehlobo kusuka kuLweti kuya kuNdlovana...""  This directly indicates a high level of physical fitness is required. The other options are not mentioned or supported by the text.



"
Sivakashi lesinenshisekelo yekucanca intsaba singase sivakashele yini incenye ye-Antartica?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Peninsula**.

Here's why:

The text states that tourism in Antarctica is limited to a specific region: ""kungenteka kuphela ehlobo kusuka kuLweti kuya kuNdlovana, futsi kakhulu kugcila ePeninsula, Tichingi naseRoss Sea."" This means the Peninsula is one of the areas where visitors can go. The other options are mentioned as locations *within* the Peninsula, not distinct regions in their own right that are mentioned as tourist destinations.
"
Kukuphi lapho amancane khona ematfuba ekutsi indzawo yekuhlola yangembi kwesikhatsi sesimanjemanje ibe khona?,"The correct answer is **A: Endzaweni lokufikeka melula kuyo** (In an easily accessible place).

Here's why:

The passage states that science resources are now readily available, even in cities and educational institutions, and that research is done in accessible locations.  Option A directly reflects this idea of accessibility. The other options don't align as well:

* **B: Enkhabeni yelidolobha** (In the city center) - While potentially accessible, it doesn't specifically address the ease of access *now*.
* **C: Endzaweni lechelile** (In a remote place) - This is the opposite of the trend described in the passage.
* **D: Etakhiweni telikolishi** (In a college building) -  While colleges are mentioned, the passage emphasizes broader accessibility beyond just colleges.



"
Kukuphi lapho sibonakudze sesimanjemanje sekwenta luhlolo lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi sibekwe khona?,"The correct answer is **A: Emsamo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngoba kungcola etikhatsini tangaphambili bekungasiyo inkhinga njengalamuhla, ngalokutayelekile kutfolakala emadolobheni noma etikhungweni tekufundza, kutfolaka melula kunaleto letakhiwa etindzaweni tesimanje. Tibonakudze tesimanjemanje tekucwaninga tinkhulu futsi telizinga leliphakeme futsi tingasetjentiswa etindzaweni letikhashane letinesimo lesihle.""

This translates to: ""Because in the past, it wasn't a problem like it is now, it was easier to find in cities or educational institutions, but it is now found in more convenient places than those built in the past. Modern research findings are large and of a high standard and can be used in more accessible places with good conditions.""

The passage emphasizes that modern research findings are readily available in accessible places.  ""Emsamo"" (the community/neighborhood) is the most encompassing and likely place where these findings would be accessible to a wider audience than just universities or schools. While universities and schools *can* be places for research, the passage suggests broader accessibility.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Etakhiweni tenyuvesi (University building):**  While universities are places of research, the passage suggests wider accessibility than just university buildings.
* **C: Endzaweni yetemfundvo (Educational institution):** This is too broad. While universities and schools are educational institutions, the passage suggests more accessible, community-level places.
* **D: Esakhiweni lesikhulu (Building/structure):** This is too general. It doesn't specify *what* kind of building.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi indzawo lokungaba kahle kuya kuyo nawufuna ibhishi lethulile?","The correct answer is **B: I-Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emabhishi aseTamaki Drive aseWaitemata Harbour, etindzaweni tasemadolobheni eMission bay neSt Heliers..."" This indicates that Mission Bay is a good place to find calm bays. While other options are mentioned, Mission Bay is specifically listed as being within the Waitemata Harbour area, and being a suburban location, is implied to be more likely to have calmer waters suitable for swimming.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukuphi lapho timo tingaba nguletiphephe khona kutsi ungabhukusha?","The correct answer is **C: E-Central Auckland**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emabhishi aseTamaki Drive aseWaitemata Harbour, etindzaweni tasemadolobheni eMission bay neSt Heliers eCentral Auckland...kubhukusha khona kuphephile.""  This directly indicates that swimming is safe in Central Auckland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E-Devonport:** While Devonport is mentioned as the southern end of the beaches, the passage doesn't specifically say it's a safe swimming spot.
* **B: E-North Harbor District:** This is too general. The passage gives more specific locations within the North Harbor District.
* **D: E-Long Bay:** This is the northern end of the beaches, and the passage doesn't mention it as a particularly safe or popular swimming spot.



"
"Nawusavakashele indzawo lechazwe kulesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungatsatfwa njengalokungakafaneli?","The correct answer is **C: Kuhlekisa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that it's a place of immense tragedy and respect is required. Options A and B are about showing respect. Option D is about respecting the physical space.  **Option C, ""Kuhlekisa"" (to laugh), is the only option that directly violates the respectful atmosphere described in the text.**  Laughing in such a place would be deeply inappropriate and disrespectful.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokuchaza tilwimi te-lingua francas?,"The correct answer is **B: Longesiyo imvelo**.

Here's why:

The text describes *lingua franca* as a language used for communication between people who don't share a native language. It's not the native language of any of the speakers. This definition directly aligns with the characteristics of a *lingua franca*, which is a non-native language used for communication.  Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they relate to language origins and development, not its function as a bridge between different languages.



"
Ngumaphi emavi langatichazi kahle tilwimi letingasito letiyinhloko?,"The correct answer is **C: Tilwimi letakhiwe kuze ticatulule tinkinga tekuchumana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tilwimi letisetjentiselwa kuchumanisa bantfu lokungenteka abevani nabakhuluma letinye tilwimi."" (The language used to connect people who are strangers and who speak different languages.) This points to a constructed language designed for communication.
* **The passage also implies a deliberate design:** ""Behlukanisiwe elulwiminni loluvamile emkhatsini wetikhulumi, lokulwimi loluvamile lelibese likhulunywa kakhulu ngenca yesisizatfu letsite njengendlela yekuchumana emkhatsini webantfu labakhuluma letinye tilwimi."" (It differs from common language between speakers, common language is often spoken in terms of the third person as a means of communication between people who speak different languages.) This suggests a system built *to overcome* the limitations of natural languages in cross-lingual communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tilwimi letisetjentiselwa kuchumanisa bantfu lokungenteka abevani nabakhuluma:** While partially true, it doesn't emphasize the *constructed* nature of the language.  It's a description of *what* it's used for, not *what kind* of language it is.
* **B: Tilwimi kokubili temvelo naletakhiwe:**  The passage clearly distinguishes it from ""tilwimi loluvamile"" (common language), which is typically natural/evolved.
* **D: Tilwimi letakhiwe letisetjentiswa kakhulu bantfu labakhuluma tilwimi letehlukene:** The passage doesn't suggest it's *widely used*. The main focus is on its purpose in facilitating communication between *strangers*.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini umuntfu lokufanele ayihlole nangabe atohamba ngemkhumbi ebusika?","The correct answer is **C: Imigomo (Regulations/Rules)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bantfu labahamba ngemkhumbi asikho sidzingo sekutsi babe nemavisa (buka imigomo)."" This translates to ""People traveling by ship do not need visas (see the regulations/rules).""  The passage is warning about the cold weather affecting vulnerable people, and then specifies to check the regulations regarding visas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Indzawo ligumbi lelikuyo (The place where it is)** - While relevant in general, the text focuses on checking regulations, not the specific location.
* **B: Lokudzingekako kuze utfole i-Visa (Necessities and obtaining a Visa)** - The text says people *don't* need visas, so this is the opposite of what's being emphasized.
* **D: Bungako besikhatsi lesicitfwa edolobheni (The amount of time and time spent in the city)** -  The text mentions the time spent in Saint Petersburg *as a consequence* of the ship journey, but it's not the primary thing to check for winter travel.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nangabe umkhumbi umuntfu lawugibele usehlobo, yini langase ayigweme?","The correct answer is **C: Lokudzingekako kuze utfole i-Visa (The need to get a visa)**.

Here's why:

The text states that people traveling by ship to Saint Petersburg **do not need a visa** (buka imigomo). The question asks what might prevent someone from boarding the ship. Since a visa isn't a barrier, the reason must be something else mentioned in the text. The text says that traveling by ship involves spending time in the city, and also that traveling by ship can cause a lot of discomfort if you are more sensitive. However, neither of these are things that would *prevent* someone from boarding.

Therefore, the best answer is that the reason for not being allowed on the ship is that one **doesn't have a visa**, which is directly stated as not being required for ship travel to Saint Petersburg.
"
Kungani siCatalan sikhatsi lesinyenti sisetjentiswa etimphawini nasetimemetelweni eBarcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Lulwimi lwekucala lolusemtsetfweni kulelidolobha (It's the official language of the city).**

The text explicitly states: ""Kodvwa, tibonakalo letinyenti tikhonjiswa ngesiCatalan kuphela ngoba sakhetfwa ngekwemtsetfo njengelulimi lekucala lelisemtsetfweni."" (But, the signs are only shown in Catalan because it was chosen by law as the official language of the city.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sicondvwa bantfu labanyenti kuneSpanish (More people speak it than Spanish).** The text says *everyone* speaks Spanish, and that Catalan is used *despite* that.
*   **C: Lulwimi bantfu labalunconotako eBarcelona (It's the language people prefer in Barcelona).** While some people might prefer it, the *reason* for its use in signage is the official status.
*   **D: Indzawo Yetitimela kanye naletinye takhiwo tesive tivakashelwa kakhulu bantfu labakhuluma siCatalan (The metro and other city structures are visited mostly by people who speak Catalan).** The text doesn't provide information about who visits these places. The reason for Catalan's use in signage is the official status, not the demographics of visitors.



"
Nguluphi kuletilwimi letilandzelako lolusetjentiswa kakhulu eTitimeleni eBarcelona nakukhishwa timemetelo letentiwa njalo?,"The correct answer is **C: Sipanish**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lulwimi lwesiSpanish luphindze lusetjentiswe kakhulu etintfweni tekuhamba temphakatsi nakuletinye nje tindzawo."" (The Spanish language is also used very much in public transport and other places.)

While Catalan is used for signage, Spanish is *more* widely used overall. Therefore, Spanish is the language most commonly used, even if it's not always for official signage.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi indzawo yekulala leniketa nekudla kwasekuseni futsi lesezingeni lelisetulu ikubeke embili?","The answer is **B: Ifenisha yakudzala leyehlukile (Unique antique furniture)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the combination of two key elements: sleep and breakfast. It specifically mentions that in a beautiful setting, one can find high-quality bedding (like a hand-stitched quilt or a vintage bed) and a breakfast area featuring either seasonal dishes or preferred choices.  It also highlights antique furniture and a well-organized dining area.

Option B, ""Ifenisha yakudzala leyehlukile,"" directly aligns with the text's emphasis on antique furniture as a key feature that elevates the sleeping and eating experience. The other options are not specifically mentioned or emphasized in the text.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasilo lelinye lemaphuzu layinhloko ekucudzelaneni kwema-B&B akanokusho?","The best answer is **B: Tinhlobonhlobo tekudla kwasekuseni lokuniketwa ngetikhatsi letitsite**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of both sleeping and breakfast in a B&B. It states breakfast can be a ""special dish"" and a highlight for guests.  The question asks what *other* major point is considered in a B&B with no-frills offerings. Therefore, the variety and quality of the breakfast offered is a key factor, alongside a comfortable bed.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kuhlobisa kwesimanjemanje (Modern decoration):** While decoration matters, the passage focuses more on functionality and the basics.
*   **C: Tintfo tekulala letisezingeni lelisetulu (Bedding of a high standard):** The passage mentions bedding, but implies basic bedding is acceptable in a ""no-frills"" B&B.
*   **D: Kudla netinatfo lokutfolakele endzaweni (Food and amenities found in the house):** This is too broad. While food and amenities are important, breakfast is specifically highlighted as a key component.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kubanjelwe eBeijing nga-2022?","The correct answer is **B: Imicimbi yekunjuza echweni yaseTaizicheng**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the ice and snow events (including those held in venues outside of Beijing like Taizicheng) were held in Beijing.
* The question asks what *won't* be held in Beijing.
* The text explicitly says Beijing hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies.
* The ice and snow events were held in different locations, including Taizicheng, which is outside of Beijing.

Therefore, the ice and snow events in Taizicheng were not held *in* Beijing. The opening and closing ceremonies were held in Beijing.

Let's look at the other options:

* **A: Imicimbi yekuvula (Opening ceremonies):** The text states Beijing hosted the opening ceremonies.
* **C: Imicimbi yekuvala (Closing ceremonies):** The text states Beijing hosted the closing ceremonies.
* **D: Imicimbi yelichwa ledlalela ngekhatsi endlini (Indoor sports events):** The text states Beijing hosted the indoor sports events.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuluku lokulandzelako lokutawubanjelwa eBeijing nga-2022?","The correct answer is **A: Ema-Olimpiki asehlobo (The Summer Olympics)**.

The text states: ""Lidolobha laseBeijing eShayina litobamba Imidlalo yaseBusika yema-Olimpiki nga-2022, lokutolenta libe ngelekucala kubamba yomibili imidlalo yema-Olimpiki yasebusika nasehlobo."" This translates to: ""The city of Beijing, China is hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will be the first time to host both the Winter and Summer Olympics."" Therefore, the next event Beijing will host is the Summer Olympics.
"
Ngubani losengotini yekutfola i-avian influenza?,"The correct answer is **A: Bantfu lababuka tinyoni (People who look at birds)**.

The text states: ""...kodvwa kunengoti kulabo lababuka tinyoni."" ( ...but there are also people who look at birds.)
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lawuchaza kahle umkhuhlane wetinkhukhu?","The correct answer is **B: Banyenti bantfu lokubikwe kutsi banawo kwendlula tinyoni.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Umkhuhlane wetinyoni…kuningi kufakwe bantfu labasebenta ngetinkhunkhu, kodvwa futsi kunengoti kulabo lababuka tinyoni.""  This means people who have been *around* chickens (including those who observe them) have been infected.
* **Option B accurately reflects this:** It says ""Many people have been reported to have it *after* contact with chickens.""
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Tisebenti tetinkhukhu kuphela letiwutfolile:** The passage explicitly states that people who *observe* chickens can also get the flu.
    * **C: Bantfu lababuka tinyoni basengotini yekuwutfola:** The passage says people who observe chickens *can* get infected, but it doesn't say they *always* get infected in a clinic.
    * **D: Bonkhe bantfu lokubikwe kutsi banawo bafile:** The passage states that some cases have led to death, but it doesn't say *all* reported cases have resulted in death.



"
I-White Sea–Baltic Canal ihlanganisa ini?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Arctic Ocean ne-Baltic Sea**.

The text states: ""IWhite Sea–Baltic Canal ihlanganisa i-Arctic Ocean kuBaltic Sea..."" which directly answers the question.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukuluphi luhlobo lwekwekuhamba lapho emapasipoti angatsatfwa khona kuze kungaphatanyiswa umgibeli?","The correct answer is **A: Tindiza**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Etitimeleni letiya kulamanye emave luhlolo lwentiwa ekhatsi kulesitimela lesihambako futsi kufanele ube ne-ID lesemtsetfweni nawugibela leto titimela."" This refers to trains.

The passage also says: ""Etitimeleni letihamba ebusuku, emaphasipoti atsatfwa ngumholeli ungatophazamiseka nasowulele.""  This explicitly mentions that passports can be taken from passengers on **night trains**.  This is a crucial detail.

Therefore, the only option that aligns with the passage's description of passports being taken from passengers is **A: Tindiza** (airplanes). While the passage mentions trains, it's the night trains that specifically relate to passport confiscation.  Airplanes are the most likely context for passport confiscation during travel, especially on overnight flights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Titimela letinendzawo yekulala ebusuku (Trains with sleeping berths):** While trains with sleeping berths *might* be places where passports could be checked, the passage focuses on night trains and passport confiscation.
*   **C: Imikhumbi (Ships):** The passage doesn't mention ships at all.
*   **D: Titimela leteca imincele (Trains that carry freight):** The passage doesn't mention freight trains.



Therefore, the best answer is **A: Tindiza** because airplanes are often the context for passport checks and potential confiscation, especially on overnight flights. However, based on the wording of the question and the information in the passage, **A is the most accurate choice**."
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho khona i-ID ingase ihlolwe kuletinye tetitimela leteca imincele?","The correct answer is **A: Ngemuva kwekwehla esitimeleni**.

The passage states: ""Etitimeleni letiya kulamanye emave luhlolo lwentiwa ekhatsi kulesitimela lesihambako futsi kufanele ube ne-ID lesemtsetfweni nawugibela leto titimela."" (On some trains, checks are done at certain stops and you must have a national ID when you board those trains.) and ""Etitimeleni letihamba ebusuku, emaphasipoti atsatfwa ngumholeli ungatophazamiseka nasowulele."" (On night trains, passports issued by the conductor may be checked and can be confiscated if you are intoxicated).

This implies that checks happen **after** boarding the train and potentially during the journey, specifically at stops.  Option A is the most accurate reflection of this.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokunematfuba labanyenti ekutsi kwenteke nawusahlala endzaweni leshisako yaseSingapore?,"The answer is **B: Kungakhoni kufinyelela etitolo (You won't be able to access the toilets)**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""etindzaweni letishisako"" (heat locations) in Singapore have ""kudzingeka kutsi ubhekane kokubili nekushisa (sikhatsi sonkhe) nelilanga lelishisako (nangabe sibhakabhaka site emafu, lokuvamile ukwenteka)."" This means these places are hot and sunny.

The question asks what happens if you are in a heat location.  The most logical consequence, given the hot and sunny conditions, is that access to facilities like toilets would be restricted or unavailable.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Kubanjwa inkunzi (The toilet is blocked):**  While toilets might occasionally get blocked, it's not a direct consequence of simply being in a hot location.
*   **C: Kuhlushwa kukhatsala (The room is flooded):**  Flooding isn't a typical consequence of heat.
*   **D: Kulahleka (You lose something):**  Losing something isn't directly related to heat or the location being a ""heat location"".



Therefore, the most reasonable answer is **B**."
Ngubani longase afuna kungadli emakhekhe aseJalimane?,"The correct answer is **A: Umuntfu loguliswa kakhulu ngemantongomane** (Someone who is very allergic to nuts).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that German cakes often contain almonds and hazelnuts. Someone with a nut allergy would not be able to eat these cakes. The other options are not directly indicated as reasons someone *wouldn't* want to eat them.
"
Ngusiphi sitsako lesitsatfwa njengencenye yemakhekhe aseJalimane yangesikhatsi lesitsite?,"The correct answer is **A: Emahhabhula** (Apricots).

The text explicitly states: ""Emakhekhe lafakwa titselo avamile lawemahhabhula wona entiwa umnyaka wonke..."" which translates to ""Cakes filled with apricots are common and eaten throughout the year...""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kunconywe nawuhamba ngemali lencane?","The correct answer is **C: Cela imali kubantfu** (Ask people for money).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly advises against resorting to unethical or illegal means to save money while traveling. Asking people for money falls squarely into that category. The passage condemns theft and begging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kutfola imisetjentana phakatsi neluhambo (Negotiate prices at home and during the trip):** This is a good cost-saving strategy and not discouraged.
* **B: Kulungele kushintja lizinga lakho lekunetseteka (Be prepared to adjust your standard of living):** This is also a sensible approach for budget travel.
* **D: Nciphisa tindleko letinjengetekudla netendzawo yekuhlala (Reduce expenses like food and accommodation):** This is a core principle of budget travel and is encouraged.



Therefore, begging (option C) is the only action the passage strongly discourages as a way to save money while traveling.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani longaba nesikhatsi lesimatima nakahamba ngemali lencane kakhulu?","The correct answer is **B: Umuntfu lote sikhatsi lesicinile (Someone who has very little time)**.

Here's why:

The text focuses on people who want to travel but have limited funds and time.  The phrase ""ngatama kunciphisa tindleko takho"" (to reduce your costs) and the mention of ""kungangenwa khona"" (places where you can eat cheaply) strongly suggest the target audience is those with limited resources. The question directly asks who has both limited time *and* very little money, which aligns perfectly with the text's focus on budget travel.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Umuntfu lowemukela insayeya (Someone who accepts an internship):**  While internships can be a way to travel cheaply, the text isn't specifically about internships.
* **C: Umuntfu lohlela kusebenta nakasavakasha (Someone who plans to work and travel):** This describes a travel *style*, but the question emphasizes the *constraints* of limited time and money.
* **D: Umuntfu lotsandza kulandzela luhla lwetintfo letentiwako (Someone who likes to follow the trend of their social circle):** This has nothing to do with travel budget or time constraints.



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langakuchazi kahle kushayela emkhatsini we-Point Marion ne-Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuyetfukela kutsi litubane lelibekiwe ligcinwe.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the challenging nature of the drive between Point Marion and Fairmont due to winding roads and limited visibility. It *specifically* states that maintaining the posted speed limit of 35-40 mph is crucial. This implies that drivers *don't* always adhere to the speed limit, making it a potential hazard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kunetincenye letindze temigwaco yasemaphandleni:** The passage mentions winding roads, which are common in rural areas. So, this is likely true.
*   **B: Imizila mincane:** The passage describes the roads as ""tight"" and ""narrow,"" so it doesn't state they are wide. Therefore, this is likely false.
*   **D: Isevisi yamahlalekhikhini ayisiyo inkinga:** The passage focuses on driving conditions, not the availability of services. Whether or not there are gas stations isn't directly related to the challenging drive itself.

Therefore, the most accurate statement about the drive between Point Marion and Fairmont, based on the passage, is that drivers often *don't* follow the posted speed limit.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokufanele kukhatsate kakhulu bashayeli labashayela emgwacweni i-Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **A: Kubambeka esiminyaminyeni setimoti**.

The passage specifically states: ""...the challenge lies in driving through the **tight, winding roads** of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh corridor, avoiding the exposed locations in the highlands.""

While the other options might be challenges, they aren't highlighted as the primary concern in the text. The tight, winding roads are repeatedly emphasized as the key difficulty.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungadzingeki kuze ucale kugcuma emfuleni losendzaweni leneliwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Likhono lekubhukusha (The ability to dive)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the process of a male leopard (kuzuba) going to a river to bathe. It mentions several steps:

* **Washing in the river:** This is the primary action.
* **Preening:**  (kubhukusha) is mentioned as one of the actions.
* **Scratching the tree:** (kukhwela intsaba) is another action.
* **Finishing with a pounce:** (kugcuma) is the final action.
* **Being cautious and preparing:** (kudzingeka uceceshwe kancane nobe ukulungele ngokwemtimba kukwenta) is essential for success.

The question asks what is *not* needed before pouncing into the river. While all the options are related to the overall behavior of a leopard, **the ability to dive (likhono lekubhukusha)** is not a *necessary* precursor to pouncing into the river.  The description focuses on getting ready *around* the river, not *in* the river. The other options, tree scratching, finishing, and caution, are all steps taken *before* the final pounce.



Therefore, the answer is **A**."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungase kudzingeke nawusagcuma emfuleni losendzaweni leneliwa?,"The answer is **D: Likhono lekubhukusha (The ability to swim)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the process of spearfishing in shallow waters, especially at dawn. It mentions the need for patience, stealth, and specific techniques like creeping, wading, and stalking.  After successfully spearfishing and getting into the water, the crucial next step is the ability to swim.  You need to be able to navigate the water and potentially escape if needed.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Likhono lelisetulu lekudlala (The skill of playing with a stick)** - While related to spearfishing, this isn't a necessary skill after actually catching the fish.
* **B: Sipiliyoni sekunjweza ekhatsi emantini (Experience wading in the mornings)** -  While experience wading is helpful, it doesn't guarantee the ability to swim or handle yourself in the water after spearfishing.
* **C: Sitifiketi sekugcuma emfuleni losendzaweni leneliwa (A certificate of spearfishing in shallow waters)** -  A certificate doesn't provide the physical skill needed to swim.



Therefore, the ability to swim is the most logical and essential next step.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengasita umuntfu lohlela kuyokhempa emotweni?","The correct answer is **B: Imoti levumela tihlalo kutsi tilale**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kukhempa ngemoto kungenteka nawunekhumbi lencane nobe i-SUV, Sedan nobe Station Wagon lenetitulo letikhonako kulala phansi.""  This translates to: ""Camping with a car is possible with a small camper, an SUV, a Sedan, or a Station Wagon that has a roof rack that can sleep.""  The key here is the ability to sleep *in* the car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kucondza kahle kutsi yini imoti yakhe lengakwati kuyenta:** This refers to driving skills, which isn't the main reason for car camping.
* **C: Lithende:**  While a roof rack is mentioned as helpful, it's not the core reason someone would choose car camping.
* **D: Indzawo yekukhempa lengasiyo yawonkhewonkhe:** This refers to campsite availability, not car suitability for camping.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini bantfu labakhempa etimotweni labangase bafune kuyigwema nabafuna kunganakeki?","The correct answer is **C: Kugcumeka lithende edolobheni nome endzaweni lengasiyo yawonkhewonkhe.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kufaka lithende endzaweni letsite noma edolobheni kalula nje kungadvonsa emehlo ebantfu ngalokungenasidzingo."" (Parking a car in a place like a city or a place that isn't always suitable can easily attract attention unnecessarily.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kushayela imoti lenkhudlwana, njenge-SUV nome iveni lencane:** The passage actually says that vehicles like SUVs, sedans, and station wagons with sleeping capabilities are *suitable* for car camping.
* **B: Kutsatsa luhambo loludze lwasemgwacweni:** The passage says car camping is a good way to travel, but it doesn't mention specifically avoiding traveling in the countryside.
* **D: Kungetayelani nemoti labayishayelako:** This option is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lowakha i-Casablanca kabusha lihlandla lesibili?","The correct answer is **A: NgemaPutukezi**.

The passage states: ""Lombusi waseMorocco walakha kabusha lelidolobhakati walicamba ngekutsi yiDaru l-Badya kepha batsengisi base-Spain labacalisa tekutsengiselana khona balibita ngekutsi yiCasablanca."" This translates to ""The King of Morocco rebuilt the city and renamed it Daru l-Badya, but Spanish traders renamed it Casablanca.""  Therefore, the Spanish traders are the ones who renamed it Casablanca after the Moroccan king rebuilt it.
"
Bobani labashiya lidolobha lesimanje lase-Casablanca ngemuva kwesehlakalo semvelo?,"The correct answer is **B: NgemaPutukezi (Portuguese)**.

The text states: ""EmaPutukezi ayibhidlita futsi ayakha kabusha ase ayetsa ngekutsi yiCasa Branca, kodvwa ase ayayiyekela ngemuva kwekutamatama kwemhlaba nga-1755."" This translates to: ""The Portuguese conquered it and rebuilt it, calling it Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.""

Therefore, the Portuguese were the ones who left the city behind after the earthquake.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, i-Sintra yakutfola kanjani kucashelwa phakatsi kwebantfu bekuhamba?","The correct answer is **C: Kubuketa lokuhle kwa-Lord Byron**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ngasenyakatfo futsi melula kufika kulo ngulelidolobha laseSintra lelikahle futsi lelikhangako futsi **lelentiwa laba ngulelidvumile kubantfu bakulamanye emave ngenca yembiko lokhatimulako webukhakhati balo lowabhalwa nguLord Byron**.""

This translates to: ""I traveled and arrived in that beautiful and dazzling town of Sintra, **brought to fame by the great poet Lord Byron** because of the concluding verses of his poem.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: ECabo da Roca:** Cabo da Roca is just a location near Sintra, not the reason for its fame.
* **B: Kubonakala kwaMariya:** While Sintra is a Marian shrine, the text attributes its initial fame to Lord Byron.
* **D: Umlandvo wayo wetekutsandzana:** The bus line (Scotturb 403) is a means of transportation *to* Sintra, not the cause of its fame.



"
Yini lengacashelwa yi-Armenia?,"The correct answer is **B: Imphi ngalokumelene na-Azeris** (They expelled the Azeris from the land).

The passage states: ""Nga-1994, lesigodzi sase-Armenia ngebuhlanga iNagorno-Karabakh yase-Azerbaijan yasusa imphi nema-Azeris."" which translates to ""In 1994, the Armenian army expelled the Azeris from the land of Nagorno-Karabakh, which belonged to Azerbaijan.""
"
Yini lechubeka iphazamisa buhlobo emkhatsini we-Azerbaijan ne-Armenia?,"The correct answer is **B: Imphi yanga-1994**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the war of 1994 led to the displacement of Azerbaijanis from Nagorno-Karabakh and the establishment of a self-declared republic.
* The passage also mentions that despite the republic's existence, it hasn't been recognized by any country, including Armenia.
* Finally, the passage connects the ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan to the unresolved conflict stemming from the 1994 war.

While the other options might be related to the broader issue, the 1994 war is the *direct cause* mentioned in the passage for the ongoing conflict and broken relationship.



"
"Nawusahamba ngetekisi e-Charlotte, yini lengaholela ekukhokhisweni lokwengetiwe?","The correct answer is **B: Kuba nebagibeli labatsatfu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ubhadala kakhulu nangabe unebantfu lohamba nabo labangetulu kwabangu-2, ngako lendlela lena ingabita kakhulu ngaphandle kwesidzingo."" (You pay a lot if you have three or more people with you, so it can be very expensive unnecessarily.)

Therefore, having three or more passengers is what leads to a surge pricing/higher fare.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengatsatfwa njengentfo lembi ngekuhlala e-Charlotte nebantfwana?","The correct answer is **B: Kutsatsa itekisi (Using taxis)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ematekisi akakavami kusetjentiswa imindeni yaseCharlotte, noma nje bangawasebentisa kuletinye timo. Ubhadala kakhulu nangabe unebantfu lohamba nabo labangetulu kwabangu-2, ngako lendlela lena ingabita kakhulu ngaphandle kwesidzingo.""

This translates to: ""Taxis are not commonly used by Charlotte families, or they may use them for other purposes. It is very expensive if you have more than 2 people traveling with you, so it is often unnecessary.""

Therefore, the passage highlights the high cost of taxis as a potential drawback of living in Charlotte with children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imali yetindlu (Housing costs):** While housing costs *are* a concern in many cities, the passage doesn't specifically focus on housing costs as a major problem for families in Charlotte.
* **C: Bahlali bakuletinye tindzawo (They live in other places):** This is simply a factual statement about visitors and not a negative aspect of living in Charlotte with children.
* **D: Kwetama kujabulela lidolobha (Being able to enjoy the city):** The passage states the opposite – that families *can* enjoy the city, but that taxis are expensive.
"
"Ngembi kwekufika kwebantfu base-Spain, bobani lebebaphetse incenye lesenyakatfo ye-Chile?","The correct answer is **C: Ema-Araucanian**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bantfu labangakaphucuki base-Araucanians (Mapuche) bahlala phakatsi naseningizimu yeChile."" This indicates that the Mapuche (Araucanians) inhabited the southern part of Chile *before* the arrival of the Spanish and continued to live there, resisting Spanish rule.  While the Incas had previously ruled the region, the Mapuche were the ones actively resisting the Spanish colonization.

Therefore, the Mapuche were the ones who held part of Chile during the time of the Spanish arrival.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungazange kwenteke nga-1810?","The correct answer is **A: Bekute hulumende lomkhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngisho noma i-Chile yamemetela inkhululeko nga-1810... bekuncoba lokuphumelelako e-Spain kwakungakatfolakali kwaze kwaba ngu-1818.""

This means that while Chile declared independence in 1810, it *didn't* have a functioning central government at that time. It was a declaration of intent, not a fully realized independence. The passage implies that a strong central government wasn't established until after the successful fight for independence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I-Chile yancoma Spain:** The passage doesn't mention Chile's actions towards Spain.
*   **C: Bekuliwa timphi ta-Napoleon:** While Napoleon's wars influenced events, the passage doesn't say Chilean troops were fighting Napoleon's forces in 1810.
*   **D: I-Chile yamemetela inkhululeko:** The passage *does* state that Chile declared independence in 1810, but the phrase ""bekuncoba lokuphumelelako e-Spain kwakungakatfolakali"" indicates that this declaration wasn't immediately followed by actual independence.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is that a functioning central government *didn't* exist in 1810."
Bantfu bangafika kanjani etindzaweni letichelile esifundzeni sase-Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngesitimela nome ngesikebhe** (By train or by boat).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Imigcwaco, titimela kanye nemikhumbi lehlanganisa tigodzi, timoto atikhoni kufinyelela kuleto tindzawo."" This translates to: ""Trains, boats, and ferries connect the villages, cars cannot reach these places.""

Therefore, the only ways to reach these villages are by train or by boat.
"
Ligama lesiTaliyane lelitsi ‘Cinque Terre’ libhekisela kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindzawo letisihlanu (Five Places)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Cinque Terre, lokusho kutsi Tindzawo Letinhlanu..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Five Places...""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesikebhe lolulungela timo letingase tibe nguletishelelako ebusika?","The correct answer is **A: Emabhudzi lanetitsendze letincane (Boots with small treads)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""Titsendze kufanele tibe phansi futsi tivuleke"" (Treads should be low and open).  This describes small, shallow treads. Options B and C describe treads that are the opposite – large or high. Option D describes the pattern size, not the tread *type*.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokungeke kusite ekuvikeleni kushelela emigwacweni lenelichwa ngesikhatsi sasebusika?,"The correct answer is **A: Luswayi (Salt)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that salt (sodium chloride) is commonly used to *prevent* ice and snow from bonding to surfaces, making them slippery.  It also mentions that salt can actually *cause* slipping when it melts and refreezes. Therefore, it's not something you want around for safety. The other options (gravel, sand, and calcium chloride) are all mentioned as materials used *to improve traction* and prevent slipping.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokuchaza kahle kufana lokukhona emkhatsini we-Hawaii ne-Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **A: Totimbili letindzawo tinemahhotela lamanyenti lamakhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Njengoba tihambisana ngetikhatsi neHawaii, tichingi ngaletinye tikhatsi kucatjangwa kutsi """"tase-Hawaii"""". Noma kukuncane, kungikhumbuta letinye tivakashi letikhulile taseHawaii ngemuva kwebubusi ngaphandle kwalamahhotela lamakhulu etivakashi nalokunye kutfutfuka."" This indicates that both Hawaii and the Cook Islands *used to have* a lot of large tourist hotels.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:

*   **B: Totimbili letindzawo atisiwo emave** - The passage doesn't mention the location of either place.
*   **C: Letindzawo tinesikhatsi lesifanako** - The passage doesn't discuss the climate or seasons.
*   **D: Totimbili letindzawo tite emadolobha** - The passage says the Cook Islands *do* have towns, but doesn't say Hawaii does.



"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungayichazi kahle i-Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **A: Yincane kune-Hawaii (It's smaller than Hawaii)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Njengoba tihambisana ngetikhatsi neHawaii... tichingi ngaletinye tikhatsi kucatjangwa kutsi """"tase-Hawaii""""."" This implies the Cook Islands are *compared* to Hawaii, but also that they are *not* smaller. In fact, the text provides information about the size of the Cook Islands (2.2 km2), implying it's a significant size.
* **The text mentions:**  ""Lesichingi saseCook site emadolobha kodvwa sinetichingi letingu 15 letehlukene. Lesiyinhloko yiRarotonga kanye ne-Aitutaki."" This confirms that Rarotonga and Aitutaki are major islands.
* **The text states:** ""Noma kukuncane..."" This explicitly says the Cook Islands are sometimes called ""Hawaii,"" suggesting they have similar characteristics.
* **The text indicates:** ""Lesichingi saseCook site emadolobha kodvwa sinetichingi letingu 15 letehlukene. Lesiyinhloko yiRarotonga kanye ne-Aitutaki."" This states the islands have similar climate as Hawaii. 

Therefore, the only statement that doesn't align with the information in the text is that the Cook Islands are smaller than Hawaii.



"
Nguyiphi kuletindzawo letilandzelako talabagadza tilwane lenetinhlobo letimbili tetindzawo tekulala longakhetsa kuto?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Sirena**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sirena ngiyo kuphela indzawo lapho ungakhona kulala khona futsi udle nekudla lokushisako ngetulu nje kwekukhempa."" (Sirena is the only place where you can camp and eat cooked food right above a campsite.)

The text also mentions that La Leona only offers campsites and no food. Los Patos and San Pedrillo are not mentioned as options within the provided text.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi lapho ungafuna khona imvume yepaki nawufuna kusebentisa kheshi kunesikweleti?","The correct answer is **B: E-Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ungenteka kutsi utfole imvume yekungena epaki ngalokucondzile eRanger Station ePuerto Jiménez..."" (You can obtain a permit to enter the park at the Ranger Station in Puerto Jiménez...).
* It also mentions that they accept payment by card, not cash.

Therefore, Puerto Jiménez is the place to get a park permit and pay with a card. Options A, C, and D are incorrect based on the information provided.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwekuntjuza echweni lolwentiwa endzaweni leyehlelako?","The correct answer is **A: Kuhamba nge-ski (Skiing)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Cabanga ngekuhamba echweni njengekucanca intsaba."" which translates to ""Think of skiing as swimming in the snow.""  It also mentions that alpine skiing involves specific gear and requires going to mountainous areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuntjuza echweni etindzaweni tasemakhaya (Skiing in local areas):** The passage distinguishes alpine skiing from general skiing and emphasizes mountain environments.
* **C: Kuhamba nato tonkhe tintfo lotidzingako (Carrying all the things you need):** While true for skiing, it's not the *type* of skiing the passage is describing.
* **D: Kuntjuza ube umeme tikhwama (Skiing with a sled):**  The passage doesn't mention sleds or this type of skiing.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengasita bantfu labantjuza etindzaweni letisemaphandleni labafuna kufinyelela litubane lelisetulu?","The correct answer is **A: Emabhudzi lacinile (Snowshoes)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes hiking in the snow as a way to reach places where there's snow, often not accessible by typical hiking or alpine trekking. It specifically mentions needing special equipment and skills. Snowshoes are the specialized equipment used to walk on top of deep snow, making them essential for this type of travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bhaki losindzako (Hiking boots):** Hiking boots are suitable for regular hiking on trails, but not for deep snow.
*   **C: Timo letikahle (Good boots):** While good boots are important for hiking, they won't be sufficient for traversing deep snow.
*   **D: Tindlela letilungisiwe (Paved paths):** Paved paths are irrelevant to the topic of hiking in snowy, remote areas.



"
Bantfu labebahambile labanenkinga yekwetfuka nababuyela ekhaya yini labakutfola kumatima kuyenta?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwetayela lisiko lendzawo lensha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tivakashi letakhandza kumelula kutivumelanisa nalelisiko lelisha ngasikhatsi tiba nebumatima kuphindze titivumelanise nelisiko lesive sakito."" This translates to ""Tourists find it difficult to adapt to a new culture and sometimes feel sad to readjust to their own culture.""

The passage emphasizes the difficulty of adapting to the new culture.  Options B, C, and D don't directly address the core issue of adapting to a different cultural style.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kwetfuka nawubuyela ekhaya kungabe matima ngalokukhetsekile kuluphi luhlobo lwemuntfu lobekahambile?","The correct answer is **A: Bantfu labahambako labahlangabetane nekwetfuswa lisiko (People who are exposed to culture shock).**

Here's why:

The passage specifically describes the experience of ""kwetfuka"" (culture shock) when returning home after a period of living in a different culture.  It mentions feeling a disconnect from familiar customs and potentially feeling lonely because those customs are no longer present. This aligns directly with the definition of culture shock.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Bantfu labahambako labasheshe betayele nabakulamanye emave (People who travel quickly and frequently):**  While frequent travel *could* increase exposure to different cultures, the passage focuses on the *return* home and the *result* of that return (culture shock).
* **C: Bantfu labahambako labaseseholidini letitsandzani (People who go on romantic holidays):** The passage doesn't specify the *type* of holiday, only that the person lived in a *different culture*.
* **D: Bantfu labahambako labete sineke (People who travel with a group):** The passage doesn't mention whether the person traveled alone or with others.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately reflects the central theme of the passage."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokufanele bantfu bangakwenti esilwaneni lokutsiwa yimusi?,"The best answer is **C: Kutsatsa kancane ingoti yaso**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what people should do to avoid being stung.** The passage states that the Moose will defend itself if attacked.
* **Cutsatsa kancane ingoti yaso (It lightly flicks its tail)** is a defensive action. By flicking its tail, the moose can warn potential attackers and potentially deter them.
* **A: Kunganaki kutsi ikhona (Pretend it's not there)** is not a good strategy; the passage says it *will* defend itself.
* **B: Kuya ngelitubane leliphansi kakhulu (Go very low to the ground)** might offer some protection, but it's not the primary defensive action described.
* **D: Kuyibukela khashane (Stare it down)** could escalate the situation and provoke a more aggressive response.



Therefore, flicking its tail is the most logical and defensible action based on the provided text."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana nesilwane lokutsiwa yimusi?","The correct answer is **B: Ngaletinye tikhatsi akatsatfwa njengetilwane letiyingoti (Sometimes it is not treated as a domestic animal)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""IMoose (leyatiwa ngele elk) ngekutalwa alinalo lulaka, kodvwa iyativikela uma ibona kuhlaselwa. Bantfu labangati kutsi lesilwane lekutsiwa imooses iyingoti bangasondzela kakhulu kuyo batifake engotini."" 
* This translates to: ""Moose (also called elk) is not inherently aggressive, but it defends itself if it is attacked. Many people believe that the animal called a moose is a domestic animal and get too close to it and try to put it in a pen.""

The text implies that despite the belief that moose are domestic animals, they are not and therefore shouldn't be treated as such. Option B reflects this by stating they are *sometimes* not treated as domestic animals, highlighting the misconception.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngekwemvelo tilwane letinelulaka (Naturally, it is an aggressive animal):** The text explicitly states the opposite - it's *not* inherently aggressive.
* **C: Angatfukutseliswa bantfu labasondzele kakhulu (It can be approached by people who get too close):** The text warns against people getting too close, implying it *cannot* be approached safely.
* **D: Ayativikela nangabe kudzingekile (It does not defend itself even when necessary):** The text clearly states that it *does* defend itself if attacked.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kube yingoti kakhulu kumuntfu lohamba elugwadvule?","The correct answer is **A: Kushoda kwetimphahla letifutfumele ngebusuku lobubandzako** (Lack of warm clothing at night in the darkness).

Here's why:

The question describes a scenario where travelers are afraid of the dark and animals. It mentions that even a warm tent can be cold at night.  The passage explicitly states that **""Kushoda kwetimphahla letifutfumele ngebusuku lobubandzako""** translates to ""Lack of warm clothing at night in the darkness"".  This directly relates to the fear and vulnerability mentioned in the first part of the question.  It's a very likely cause for fear.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Kubona lutalagu lolwenta kube ngatsiumuntfu ubona emanti** (Seeing a shadow that makes someone think they see something in the dark): While shadows *could* contribute to fear, the passage doesn't specifically emphasize shadows as a primary source of the fear.
* **C: Kumosha emandla usagijimisa lutalagu** (Washing hands and then rubbing a shadow): This is a nonsensical action and not linked to the core fear described.
* **D: Kumosha emanti usagijimisa lutalagu** (Washing hands and then rubbing a shadow): This is also nonsensical and not relevant to the described situation.

Therefore, the lack of warm clothing directly addresses the fear and vulnerability described in the initial text, making it the most likely answer.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungashiwongo njengengoti bantfu labahamba elugwadvule labangase babhekane nayo?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Hypothermia**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes situations where people traveling at night can be scared by darkness, animals, or even the cold.** This points towards potential dangers related to low temperatures.
* **Hypothermia is a dangerous condition caused by a drop in body temperature.**  Being exposed to cold, especially at night, makes hypothermia a significant risk.
* Let's look at why the other options are less likely:
    * **A: Kushoda kwemati (Lack of water):** While dehydration is a risk, the passage focuses on fear of the dark and cold, not specifically a lack of water.
    * **B: Lutalagu (Lightning):** Lightning is a possibility but not as directly suggested by the text as the risk of cold.
    * **D: Kushiswa lilanga (Sunburn):** Sunburn is a concern during the day, not at night.

Therefore, **Hypothermia** is the most relevant and dangerous danger to consider in the context of the passage."
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguliphi licembu lebantfu lelatsintseka kakhulu ngemuva kwekufika kwebahloli bemave?","The correct answer is **C: Ema-Taíno**.

The text states: ""Ngemuva kweminyaka lembalwa kulandzela kufika kwebahloli bemave lababuya eYurophu, linani lebantfu baseTainos lancishiswa bancobi baseSpain."" This directly indicates that the Taíno people were severely impacted by the arrival of the Europeans. While the Caribes were also present, the text specifically highlights the devastation faced by the Taínos.  The text also mentions the Spanish conquistadors, but the question asks which group was *most* impacted, and the text focuses on the Taínos suffering population decline."
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi lulwimi lobelukhulunywa bantfu baseCaribean?","The correct answer is **D: Si-Arawakan**.

The text states: ""EmaCaribes bekabantfu lebebakhuluma si-Arawaka..."" which translates to ""The Caribes were people who spoke Arawakan...""

Ngubani lokufanele abongwe ngekwenta umdlalo wekuntjuza echweni watiwe njengemdlalo wekutijabulisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Bantfu labahla emihumeni (Ski bums)**.

The passage states: ""Lomcondvo wekusheleleta mudzala kakhulu - imidvwebo lesemihumeni lekhombisa basheleleti yakadzeni kakhulu kusukela kubo-5000 BC! Kuntjweza echweni kusukela emuva cishe ngelikhulu lesi-17, futsi nga-1861 ikilabhu yekucala yemaciko ekuntjuza echweni yavulwa bantfu base-Norwein e-Astralia. Labanye bababita ngekutsi ngekutsi ngema """"ski bums"""" bahlale bahlela kutsi bangavakasha kuphi khona batontjweza.""

This clearly indicates that ""ski bums"" are credited with popularizing skiing and snowboarding as a recreational activity. While Norwegians and Australians played a role in the formalization of the sport, the passage specifically attributes the *popularization* to ""ski bums.""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kungasiphi sikhatsi lapho kuntjuza echweni kwacashelwa kwekucala njengemdlalo?","The correct answer is **B: Nga-5000 BC**.

The passage states: ""Lomcondvo wekusheleleta mudzala kakhulu - imidvwebo lesemihumeni lekhombisa basheleleti yakadzeni kakhulu kusukela kubo-5000 BC!"" (This tradition is very old - cave paintings showing very ancient skis date back to 5000 BC!).  While skiing as a recreational activity developed later, the earliest evidence of skiing exists from 5000 BC.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokuhlotjaniswa ngesichingi lesikhulu kunato tonkhe elugwini lwe-Afrika lesemphumalanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Litfonya leYurophu (European Contact)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Litfonya leYurophu kanye nekwenta lamanye emave emakoloni kwacala ngelikhulu lesi 15 ngesikhatsi inhloli yasePortugal Vasco da Gama atfola indlela lehamba ekapa leya eNdiya."" This indicates that European contact was a major turning point and significant event in the history of the southeastern African coast.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inkholo yeMasulumane (Islam):** While Islam did spread to the area, the passage mentions it *after* the European contact and doesn't say it was the *most* significant event.
*   **C: Tilwane tesiganga (Plagues):** Plagues were a factor, but not the most defining or overarching event.
*   **D: Tindzawo tekungcebeleka takanokusho (Trading Posts):** Trading posts were a *result* of European contact, not the primary event itself.

Therefore, European contact is presented as the most significant historical development in the southeastern African coastal region according to the provided text."
Yini lengasiyo imfanelo yetichingi letincane taseMphumalanga Ye-Afrika? ,"The correct answer is **D: Kukhululeka kuletinye tive** (They were free from other powers).

Here's why:

The text states that many of the islands were initially independent. However, it goes on to say they were *eventually* taken over by powers like France, Arabs, and Portugal. This means they were *not* always free from other powers. The other options are all mentioned in the text as characteristics of the islands:

*   **A: Kuchumana neFrance** (Contact with France) - The text explicitly mentions France's involvement.
*   **B: Tindzawo letinyenti tekungcebeleka** (Strategic locations) - The text describes them as having strategic locations.
*   **C: Kwatiwa ngetilwane tesiganga** (Taken by pirates) - The text states they were often targets of pirates.



Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the text."
"Ngekwalesicephu, Liphasika ligunjwa njani, ikakhulukati emasontfo emdzabu?","The correct answer is **B: Kubamba umlindzelo ngeMgcibelo.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kunetinchazelo tebuKhristu kulelisiko, kodvwa tingase tibe ngimisimeto yangesikhatsi sakadzeni ngaphambi kwebuKhristu. Lamaningi emasontfo kaningi abamba imilindzelo ngema-Easter ngeMgcibelo..."" (This translates to: ""This tradition has Christian meanings, but it may be a custom from times before Christ. Many times they hold vigils on Easter Eve..."")

The passage highlights the tradition of holding vigils (umlindzelo) on Easter Eve.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kuba nemsimeto wentalo** (Having a gift tradition) - While gift-giving can be associated with Easter, it's not the primary focus mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Kuba nemcimbi wasentfwasahlobo welibandla** (Having a church-related event) - The passage mentions church events, but the specific focus is the vigil.
* **D: Kubukela kuphuma kwelilanga** (Watching the sunrise) -  The passage mentions watching the sunrise, but it's presented as one aspect of the tradition, not the defining characteristic. The vigil is more central.

"Kuze ugweme letinye tintfo letifunekako nawungena e-Ecuador, sakhamuti saseCuba kufanele sicale sibe nani?","The correct answer is **A: Ipasipoti lesalelwe sikhatsi lesingetulu kwetinyanga letingu-6 kusuka etinsukwini tekuhamba.**

The text explicitly states: ""Ipasipoti yakho kufanele ibe semtsetfweni lokungenani tinyanga letingu-6 ngaphambi kwekutsi kufike lilanga lakho lekuhamba."" (Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your intended stay.)

While the other options are relevant requirements, the passport validity is directly linked to avoiding the invitation letter issue.
"
Yini timfuneko tekuvakasha e-Ecuador letingentelwanga yona?,"The correct answer is **D: Kucinisekisa kutsi emapasipoti akakaphelelwa sikhatsi.**

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Iphasipoti yakho kufanele ibe semtsetfweni lokungenani tinyanga letingu-6 ngaphambi kwekutsi kufike lilanga lakho lekuhamba.""  This means a passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the intended stay.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kugcina linani letivakashi lilincane:**  While managing visitor numbers might be a general policy, it's not specifically mentioned in the text as a requirement for entry.
* **B: Kugcina kungena nekuphuma kwebantfu kuhlelekile:** The text mentions orderly movement *between* the two countries, not as a requirement for entry.
* **C: Kucinisekisa budze besikhatsi lesitohlalwa ngumuntfu lovakashile:**  While the text mentions confirming the duration of the trip through a return ticket, it doesn't specifically state a requirement to confirm the *purpose* of the visit or that the traveler is a specific person.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungase kubite kakhulu kulelinye live kwendlula eveni lakho?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuhlolwa kwemehlo (Eye exam)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the need for an eye exam, especially if you have limited financial resources, as it might be covered by insurance. The text emphasizes getting an eye exam at home and then obtaining a doctor's note to take elsewhere. The other options are not directly addressed or relevant to the problem described in the text.
"
Nguyiphi ingoti lengase ibe khona ngekutsenga emafulemu lasezingeni lelisetulu kulelinye live?,"The correct answer is **A: Kungase kudzingeke imali leyengetiwe yekuhlolwa kwemehlo.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Cabangela kutfola kuhlolelwa amehlo ekhaya, nakakhulu nangabe umshwalensi ukukhokhela loko..."" (Consider getting an eye exam at home, especially if insurance covers it...) This directly links the problem of needing to get eyes checked to the potential cost.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Tibuko tingase tingasebenti kulamanye emafulemu:** While potentially true, the text focuses on the *cause* of the eye problems, not necessarily whether the glasses themselves are suitable.
* **C: Angase abe ngemafulemu mbumbulu:**  This is a possible reason, but not the primary point the text is making.  The text highlights the need for an exam to *determine* the problem.
* **D: Umshuwalensi kungenteka ungawakhokheli:**  This is true, but the text implies that the *exam* itself might be the cost issue, not just the glasses.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the possibility of needing to pay for an eye exam is the core problem discussed in the text.

"Mayelana nekucetjentiswa kwemali e-Falklands, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako laliciniso?","The correct answer is **C: Mpondo wase-Falkland kufanele ushintjwe ngemuva kwekuphuma etichingini.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Intfo lematima kushintja imali yakumaFalkands nasewuphumile kuletichingi, ngako shintja lemali kucala ngaphambi kwekutsi uhambe kuletichingi.""  This translates to: ""It is advisable to exchange money from the Falklands before you go to the store, otherwise exchange money after you leave the store.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngemakhadi etikweleti nampondo waseNgilandi kuphela lokwemukelwako etichingini letingephandle** - The text says US dollars are also accepted, and that card payments are generally accepted, but with a caveat about checking with the store about fees.  This option is too restrictive.
* **B: Kuphela kwendzawo lapho kwemukelwa khona lidola laseMelika kuse-Stanley** - The text says US dollars are accepted *generally*, not *only* in Stanley.  It doesn't restrict it to just Stanley.
* **D: Ngaphandle kwampondo waseFalkland, mpondo waseNgilandi ngalokuvamile ngiyo imali leyemukelwako** - The text clearly indicates that Falkland pounds are the official currency and should be exchanged *before* you arrive.  It doesn't say British pounds are commonly accepted.



Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the text."
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngawuvakashela i-Falklands usuka eMelika, kukuphi lapho lenye indlela yekubhadala ngaphandle kwelikhadi lesikweleti ingaba lusito khona ngalokukhetsekile?","The correct answer is **A: Esitolo i-FIC Wes**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Indzawo lakungashitjwa khona imali kuletihlenge kusebhange liseStanley, lapha nje nawusuka eFIC West Store uwelela kulo."" This means you *can* exchange money at the FIC West Store.

While British Pounds and US Dollars are widely accepted, the text also advises exchanging currency *before* you travel to the Falklands.  It doesn't say that all shops accept cash. Therefore, the FIC West Store is presented as a *specific* place where you can exchange currency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuto tonkhe letichingi:** The text says ""Etichingini letikhashane emakhadi esikweleti angeke avunyelwe..."" implying not all shops accept cash.
*   **C: Etichingini letingaphandle:** The text doesn't discuss shops outside of Stanley.
*   **D: Kuso sonkhe Stanley:** While many places in Stanley might accept Pounds or Dollars, the text singles out the FIC West Store as a currency exchange point.



"
Ngumuphi umcimbi longahlotjaniswa nekugunjwa kwemikhosi yelithempeli?,"The best answer is **A: Kutalwa kwendlovu (Elephant festival)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions that ""Leminingi imikhosi yemathempeli abungatwa uma ahlanganisa umnyaka noma lophetse ahlanganisa umnyaka noma leminye imigidvo...nekungena njalo kwetindlovu letihlotjisiwe..."" (Many temple festivals are celebrated, including annual or biennial festivals, and sometimes other events like the entry of decorated elephants).

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **B: Lusuku lwekukhumbula lilanga lithempeli lelaba khona ngalo (Temple's founding day):** While temples have founding days, the passage doesn't specifically link this to a common festival with elephant involvement.
* **C: Lusuku lwekutalwa lwankulunkulu (God's birthday):** This is a possibility, but the text doesn't mention it specifically in connection with temple festivals.
* **D: Imicimbi lemikhulu letsintsa lithemppeli (Major events that involve temples):** This is too general. The question asks for a *specific* event.

Therefore, the **Elephant festival (Kutalwa kwendlovu)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
Kukuphi lapho kungabonakala khona tindlovu letihlotjisiwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Eludvwendvweni lwasemikhosini yasethempelini.**

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Leminingi imikhosi yemathempeli abungatwa uma ahlanganisa umnyaka noma lophetse ahlanganisa umnyaka noma leminye imigidvo. Imigidvo yasethempelini iKerala iyatsandzeka kuyibona, nekungena njalo kwetindlovu letihlotjisiwe...""  This directly links the elephants to the temple festivals (mikhosi yasethempelini).
* Option A is too broad. While elephants are present during that time, it doesn't specify *where*.
* Option B is partially correct (elephants are at temples), but option C is more precise.
* Option D is incorrect; the elephants are associated with the temple festivals, not specifically with Kerala's attire (titaladini).

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungenteka kuyindlela lencono yekonga imali encenyeni yebhizinisi nome yelizinga lekucala endizeni?","The correct answer is **B: Kubhuka incenye yelizinga lekucala kunencenye yebhizinisi.**

Here's why:

The passage highlights that while first-class tickets are typically expensive, there are ways to save money. It mentions:

*   **Waiting for sales:** Purchasing economy tickets during promotions.
*   **Business class upgrades:** Using business class perks or having the company pay for an upgrade.
*   **No need for a loophole:** You don't have to find a sneaky way to get a first-class seat.

Option B aligns with the savings principle: by booking a combination of economy and first-class, you can enjoy some of the benefits of a first-class experience (like space and comfort) while still controlling the cost.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

*   **A: Kubhadala ngenkapani yakho:** While helpful, this doesn't necessarily offer the *best* way to save money. It just shifts the cost to the company.
*   **C: Kubhuka indiza yelizinga lekucala lengayi ngalokucondzile endzaweni loya kuyo:**  This is likely the most expensive option and not a strategy for saving money.
*   **D: Kutfola sephulelo:** The passage states there's no need for a loophole, indicating that seeking loopholes might be risky or unreliable.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kufuna ini lokungaba kucitsa sikhatsi nawubhuka letinye tigaba tekugibela endizeni?","The correct answer is **C: Tephulelo**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how people often pay extra to fly first class for speed and comfort. It then states that there's no *need* to seek a premium (or ""tephulelo"" in SiSwati) if you're traveling on a business class ticket. 

The passage implies that if you're already paying for business class, you don't need to seek a premium upgrade.  Therefore, the question asks what would *save time* when booking a different class. The context points to the *avoidance of paying a premium*.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tindiza letiya ngalokucondzile endzaweni letsite (Flights that arrive at the terminal)**: This is irrelevant to saving time when booking a *different class*.
* **B: Incenye yebhizinisi (Part of business)**: This is vague and doesn't directly relate to saving time in booking a different class.
* **D: Incenye yelizinga lekucala (Part of the first class level)**: The passage actually says you *don't need* this.



"
Yini lokungadzingeki yengetwe nawusacatsanisa imali yetindiza letiya e-Afrikha nemali yemhlaba wonkhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Tindleko te-visa yase-Afrikha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions that visa costs *outside* of Africa are a factor to consider. It states: ""Ungakhohlwa kunenetela tindleko letingetulu tema-visa, ikhumbi yekuhamba, imoto yekukuhambisa, njll. kuleto tindzawo letingaphandle kwase-Afrikha."" (Don't forget there are significant extra costs of visas, travel insurance, transportation, etc. in these destinations outside of Africa.)

Options A and D both mention costs related to travel *outside* of Africa, as stated in the passage. Option B, while potentially relevant, isn't directly addressed in the passage as a cost to compare with global travel.

Therefore, the only cost mentioned as being *different* for travel to Africa compared to global travel is the visa cost *within* Africa.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini titolo letinkhulu leseticala kuniketa kukhetsa lokuhlukahlukene kuyo?","The correct answer is **A: Kudla lesekuvele kuvutsiwe (Prepared food)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the store offers a variety of **prepared foods** (""Siyenyuka sibalo setitolo letinetinhlobo letingafani tekudla lokuphekiwe"").
* While microwave meals (B) are *a type* of prepared food, the broader category is ""prepared food"" itself.
* ""Restaurants"" (C) are a *place* where you might find prepared food, not the type of food itself.
* ""Affordable prices"" (D) is a factor but not the defining characteristic of the variety of choices.

Therefore, the most accurate and encompassing answer is **Prepared food**.
"
Nguluphi lusito loluniketwa titolo letinkhulu lolungase lukhange likhasimende lelitsenga kudla lesekuvele kuvutsiwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Titolo tekudlela (Restaurants)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Siyenyuka sibalo setitolo letinetinhlobo letingafani tekudla lokuphekiwe. Letinye tisebentisa tifutfumeti tekudla njengema microwave nobe letinye tindlela tekufutfumeta kudla. Kulamanye emave noma letinye tinhlobo tetitolo lokungenani kunendzawo leyodvwa yekudlela, ngalokuvamile lengakahleleki kahle kodvwa lokutsengekako kuyo.""

This translates to: ""We're increasing the number of restaurants that offer a variety of prepared foods. Some use cooking methods like microwave ovens and other ways of cooking food. In many other types of restaurants, there's a separate area for takeout, which is often not well-organized but where purchases are made.""

Therefore, restaurants are the main type of establishments that offer prepared food for takeout. The other options are either descriptions of the food itself or the cooking methods used, not the establishments where you buy prepared food."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungenteka kungacondvwa bantfu baseBelgium naseSwitzerland labakhuluma siFulentji?,"The correct answer is **C: Indlela letsite yekubita emagama esiFulentji**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ikakhulukati luhlelo lwetinombolo ngesiFrench lesikhulunywa eBelgium naseSwitzerand sinetici letehlukile kusiFrench lesikhulunywa eFrance, nendlela yekubita lamanye emagama yehlukile kancane."" This directly translates to ""Particularly the numbering system in French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland has a different system than French spoken in France, and the way some words are pronounced is slightly different.""

While the other options are related to differences in the Belgian/Swiss dialect, the passage *explicitly* mentions pronunciation and the way words are pronounced, making option C the most accurate answer.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako eFrance lokungafani naseBelgium nome eSwitzerland?,"The correct answer is **A: Indlela yekubita onkhe emagama (The way words are pronounced)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ikakhulukati luhlelo lwetinombolo ngesiFrench lesikhulunywa eBelgium naseSwitzerand sinetici letehlukile kusiFrench lesikhulunywa eFrance, nendlela yekubita lamanye emagama yehlukile kancane.""  This directly points to pronunciation being a difference.
* The text also says, ""Noma kunjalo, bonkhe bantfu base-Belgium nase-Switzerland labakhuluma siFulentji ngabe bafundza siFulentji lesivamile eskolweni, khona batokhona kukuva noma ukhuluma usebentisa indlela yekubala ngesiFulentji levamile.""  This implies that pronunciation, while different, is still part of the standard French taught in school.
* Options B and C are mentioned as *similarities* (the numbering system and the standard French taught in school).
* Option D (different ways French words are written) is not mentioned in the text.



Therefore, pronunciation is the element that is different in France compared to Belgium and Switzerland, as stated in the text.

Kukusiphi simo lapho ungase unganikwa khona imali yekushonelwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Nawetama kubhuka ngalokucondzile enkapanini yetindiza kunakulabaniketa lusito labatimele.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tindiza letiniketa loku tifaka ekhatsi i-Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa futsi titindiza letisuka e-U.S noma e-Canada, nase WestJet. Kuto tonkhe tikhatsi, kufanele ubhuke ngamakhalekhukhwini wakho ngalokucondzile esiteshini setindiza."" This indicates that you are eligible for compensation if you booked directly with the airline, not through a third-party travel agent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nawuhamba ngeWestJet** - While WestJet is listed as an airline offering compensation, the text emphasizes booking directly.
*   **C: Nawuhamba ngeLufthansa usuka eParis uya eMelika** - The flight route is mentioned, but not whether booking directly with Lufthansa qualifies.
*   **D: Nawuhamba ngeDelta** - Similar to WestJet, Delta is listed, but the key is booking directly.



"
Ngukuphi lokuliciniso mayelana nemali yekushonelwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ikhokhola tindleko temngcwabo**.

The passage states: ""Tindiza letimbalwa letiniketa loku tifaka ekhatsi i-Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa futsi titindiza letisuka e-U.S noma e-Canada, nase WestJet. Kuto tonkhe tikhatsi, kufanele ubhuke ngamakhalekhukhwini wakho ngalokucondzile esiteshini setindiza.""  The first sentence says ""...letibhadalisa imali yekufelwa, lokunciphisa kancane imali loyibhadalako kuya emngcwabeni ngekushesha."" This translates to ""...that only reimburse funeral expenses, reducing the amount you have to pay for the funeral quickly.""  Therefore, the reimbursement is *for* funeral expenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kufanele ubhuke ngalokucondzile ekhasini le-inthanethi lenkapani yetindiza** - The passage states you *must* book at the airport.
* **C: Ikhokhola tindleko teluhambo loluphutfumako** - The passage says it reimburses *funeral* expenses, not the travel costs themselves.
* **D: Kufanele ubhuke ngalokucondzile nenkapani yetindiza usebentisa lucingo** -  The passage says you book at the airport, not via phone.

Kunini lapho kusebentisa i-GPS levamile kungaba lusito kakhulu khona kunekusebentisa i-app ye-GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: Nangabe uphuma ku-inthanethi (If you are offline)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Nawetama konga imali ngekutsi kungatsengwa emamephu lamasha e-GPS, noma ema-GPS latimele noma kuwarenta enkapaneni lerentisa ngetimoto. Nangabe lucingo lwakho lungakhonekithi ku-inthanethi, noma lungabambi kahle, ngete lwasebenta kahle nobe lungatfolakali.""  This means that GPS devices (which often work offline) are useful *when you are offline*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nawetama konga imali (If you want to save money):** While GPS devices *can* save money compared to renting, the primary reason for choosing a GPS *over* an app is often related to offline functionality.
* **B: Nawuciniseka kutsi utawuba nemadatha (If you want to have data):** GPS devices might provide data, but the paragraph focuses on the utility when *without* internet connectivity.
* **D: Nawungafuni kurentha idivayisi (If you don't want to rent a device):**  This refers to a different way to get a GPS - renting one. The question is about when a GPS *itself* is preferable to a GPS app.



"
Yini lengasiso sizatfu lesihle sekusebentisa i-app ye-GPS nakucatsaniswa nemshini we-GPS lotimele?,"The correct answer is **A: Kungabi nesidzingo sekukhatsateka ngema-datha (No need to worry about data costs)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kusebentisa ema-apps ekuphenya i-GPS ecingweni lakho lesimanje kungaba yindlela lemelula kakhulu nalesebentisekako kuphenya tindzawo uma uvakashe kulelinye live. Kungonga imali ngekutsi kungatsengwa emamephu lamasha e-GPS, noma ema-GPS latimele noma kuwarenta enkapaneni lerentisa ngetimoto.""  This implies that using a GPS app on your phone *avoids* the costs associated with buying new GPS maps or renting a standalone GPS device.  The cost is essentially covered by your existing phone data plan, which the passage subtly implies isn't a concern.
* **Why the other options are less accurate:**
    * **B: Konga imali (Saves money):** While using an app *can* save money (compared to renting a GPS), it's not the *most* distinct advantage compared to a standalone GPS.
    * **C: Kubalekela kurenta (Avoids renting):** This is true, but it's a consequence of using an app, not the defining advantage *over* a standalone GPS.
    * **D: Kungabi nesidzingo sekutsenga emabalave lamasha (No need to buy new maps):** This is also true, but again, it's a consequence of using an app, not the core difference compared to a dedicated GPS device.

Therefore, the lack of data cost worries is the *most* directly stated and differentiating benefit highlighted in the passage when comparing phone GPS apps to standalone GPS units.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ungacinisekisa kanjani kutsi ucondzaniswa nemkhumbi lofanelekako?","The correct answer is **C: Kubhuka nenkapani lesebenta ngekuvakasha eGalapagos.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Ciniseka kutsi inkhapani lotoyisebentisa inelwati lolujulile ngetihlenge nangetinhlobonhlobo temikhumbi... Loku kutocinisekisa kutsi lolokutsandzako kanye/nobe bumantima bakho buyafanana nemkhumbi lolokufanela kakhulu.""  This directly points to choosing a tour company that is experienced with and knowledgeable about the Galapagos Islands and its various species of boats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kubhuka ngemacembu ebangibeli labangu-8+ labatsandza tintfo letifanako:** While knowledgeable guides are helpful, the passage focuses on the boat itself and the company's experience.
* **B: Kubhuka ngesikhatsi lapho babancane bantfu labayifunako:**  This is irrelevant to choosing a boat that matches your needs.
* **D: Kusheshe ubhuke:** Speed isn't the priority; ensuring a good match for your needs is.

Here's why:

The passage states that hosts often provide ""tintfo letinetjwala endlini"" (small gifts at home) and that this is part of the way they try to make guests feel welcomed and comfortable.  The passage also mentions that guests are often surprised by this hospitality and appreciate it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuba nekukhanya kwemvelo lokunyenti (Having plenty of natural light):** While pleasant, natural light isn't typically emphasized as a key element of hospitality in the passage.
* **B: Tintfo letifana nemathikithi amahhala ekhonsathi (Things like free concert tickets):** These are too extravagant and not mentioned in the passage's description of typical hospitality.
* **D: Kungabi khona kwemawashi (Lack of clocks):** The passage states that clocks are *not* usually present and that it's seen as important *not* to constantly remind guests of time.  Therefore, the lack of clocks is part of the *approach*, not a *gift*.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini umuntfu logembulako lohlakaniphile lokufanele ayigweme?","The correct answer is **A: Kunatsa kakhulu tjwala (Drinking too much alcohol)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a type of establishment that prioritizes fun, indulgence in food and drink, and a carefree atmosphere.  The warning given is that the leaders of these places *emphasize* the importance of not being overly drunk.  This implies that *excessive* alcohol consumption is something to avoid if you want to navigate these situations successfully.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kwemukela nome ngutiphi tikhutsato (Accepting any solution):**  The text doesn't suggest avoiding accepting solutions. It's about managing oneself within a particular environment.
* **C: Kubuka emawashi (Looking at clocks):** The text states that clocks are usually absent. Therefore, looking at clocks isn't something to avoid.
* **D: Kubuta ngendzawo yekuphuma lesedvute (Asking about the exit route):** While being aware of your surroundings is good, the text doesn't specifically warn against asking about the exit. It's more about being mindful of indulgence.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi incenye yenkhulumo lebhalwa ngafeleba ekhatsi nemusho?","The correct answer is **D: Tiphawulo**.

The text states that the word ""Sie"" is often misspelled, even when it's in the middle of a sentence. It further explains that learning to use ""Sie"" correctly helps distinguish it from other words, particularly in terms of whether a noun or a particle is being used.  Particles (like ""Sie"") are punctuation marks.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini kubhala emabito ngabofeleba lokungayenta ibe lukhuni kakhulu?","The correct answer is **C: Kubhala**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the key to distinguishing ""Sie"" from similar words is to **write** it correctly.  The passage emphasizes that correctly spelling the word helps in identifying whether it's being used appropriately.  The other options are related to understanding the word but don't directly address the act of writing it as a distinguishing factor.

"Etincenyeni letisemakhaya teMalaysia, ngusiphi sento lesisho kutsi “kota”?","The correct answer is **A: Kugobisa umunwe wekukhomba**

The text explicitly states: ""e-Malaysia, lokungenani kuhlanganise bantfu base-Malaysia labasetindzaweni tasemakhaya, kusho kutsi """"wota"""" lokufana nemuno wekukhomba logobene wakhomba umtimba...""  This translates to ""In Malaysia, at least including people from the local community, 'wota' means the gesture of pointing with a finger, just like the one used in many other countries...""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi sento lesingase sisho kutsi “buya”?","The correct answer is **B: Kugoba umunwe wekukhomba**.

The text explicitly states: ""...kufanele lusetjentiselwe lowo mgomo kuphela. Ngakho-ke, sivakashi lesisuka eBrithani siya eSpain singase ngeliphutsa sitsatse kuvaleliswa ngekuphakamisa sandla (esikhundleni salomuntfu lovaleliswako) njengendlela yekutsi siphindze sibuye."" This means that in Spain, raising your hand is the gesture to indicate ""come back,"" and it is done by pointing. Therefore, ""kugoba umunwe wekukhomba"" (pointing with a finger) is the way to signal ""come back.""



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuphakamisa intsendze yesandla ibuke ngekhatsi:** While raising a hand can be a greeting in some cultures, the text clarifies it has a specific meaning in Malaysia and Spain.
*   **C: Kuphakamisa intsendze yesandla ibuke ngephandle:** This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Kuvuma ngenhloko:**  This doesn't relate to the meaning of raising a hand.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lebangela kutsi kube netimfa letinkhulu elichweni?","The correct answer is **C: Imihumbe yelichwa lewako**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emabondza kanye neluphahla lemihume yelichwa angawa kantsi timfa tingavaleka."" This translates to ""In the cracks and the snow mounds of the ice, big animals can get trapped.""  This directly points to snow mounds (mihume yelichwa) as a factor leading to large animal deaths.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngema-snow bridge (Snow bridge cracks):** While snow bridges can be dangerous, the passage specifically mentions the *mounds* of snow.
*   **B: Tinguzunga telichwa letingakatinti (Unstable ice tongues):** The passage doesn't mention unstable ice tongues.
*   **D: Lichwa lelingakacini (Submerged ice):** The passage doesn't mention submerged ice.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokungafihlwa ngema-snow bridges?","The correct answer is **B: Imihume yelichwa (Snow caves)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emabondza kanye neluphahla lemihume yelichwa angawa kantsi timfa tingavaleka."" This translates to ""In the cracks and under the overhang of snow caves, trees can be hidden.""

Therefore, snow caves are the structures mentioned as potential hiding places for trees.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, bantfu labahambako kufanele batsatse tinyatselo tekuphepha ngembi kwekuvakashela yiphi indzawo?","The correct answer is **A: Nyiragongo volcano**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions that the Nyiragongo volcano eruption in 2002 devastated Goma and continues to influence the situation there. It also states that visitors outside of Goma need to be aware of the conflict in the North Kivu province, which is linked to the volcano's impact.  Therefore, the Nyiragongo volcano poses the most significant safety risk for visitors.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Tindzawo letitungelete iGoma (Dangerous areas of Goma):** While there might be dangerous areas within Goma, the text emphasizes the broader risk related to the volcano and the conflict in North Kivu.
*   **C: Inkhaba yelidolobha (The city walls):** This is not mentioned as a safety concern.
*   **D: IRwanda (Rwanda):** The text focuses on the situation *within* the North Kivu province, specifically around Goma. While Rwanda is nearby, it's not directly linked to the primary safety concerns described.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kube yithiphu lenhle kumuntfu lovakashela iGoma?,"The correct answer is **A: Timphu letiseNyakatfo YeKivu timnandzi (The highlands of North Kivu are beautiful)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Leliidolobha futsi liyindzawo lesisekelo yekugibela intsabamlilo iNyiragongo...nalokunye kulandzelela Timfene Tentsaba lokushiphile e-Africa.""  This highlights the dangerous and unstable situation in the North Kivu region.
* **Options B, C, and D are all accurate descriptions based on the passage:**
    * **B: Yindzawo lekahle naleshiphile Yekucaca Intsaba Ubuke Emagorila (It's a beautiful place and a base for exploring the mountains and gorilla trekking)** - The passage implies this by mentioning the surrounding mountains and the history of Timfene Tentsaba.
    * **C: Ematekisi etidududu ayindlela lekahle yekuhamba (Motorbikes are a good way to get around)** - The passage mentions using ""boda-boda"" (motorbikes) for short trips and gives a price estimate.
    * **D: Incenye lephansi yentsabamlilo iNyiragongo itfolakala edolobheni (Part of the lower Nyiragongo volcano is located in the town)** - This is a direct statement from the passage.
* **Option A is misleading:** While the highlands *might* be beautiful in other circumstances, the passage focuses on the dangers and instability of the region.  Saying it's ""beautiful"" is downplaying the risks for a visitor.

Therefore, option A is the *least* helpful and potentially dangerous tip for someone visiting Goma.
"
Kunini lapho itotfolakala khona imvume yasendzaweni yasemakhaya yelilanga lekucala nga-August?,"The correct answer is **A: Nga-January 1**.

The text states: ""i-permit yekubuyela eveni yanoba nguliphi lisuku lekucala ngeNkhwenkhweti iba khona nga 1 Indlovana."" This translates to ""The backcountry permit becomes available on January 1st.""
"
Ngumuphi umgomo lokhona wekuvikela sihosha?,"The correct answer is **A: Luhlelo lwemvume loluniketwa labafike kucala**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kufaka emathende ekukhempa ngephansi kwe-Grand Canyon kufanele ukwente nawutfole imvume."" (Camping in the Grand Canyon requires a permit.)
* It further elaborates on the permit system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Timvume titfolakala kuphela ngaJanuary 1:** The passage says permits are available once a month, starting a month after the first.
* **C: Timvume titrolakala kuphela ngeticelo letentiwa matfupha:**  The passage doesn't limit permit availability to tenting only.
* **D: Timvume timbalwa:** The passage mentions a *limited* number of permits are available, but not that permits themselves are few.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi kutfolakale eluhlotjeni lwemahhotela lachazwe kulesicephu?,"The correct answer is **C: Tivakashi letatiwako naleticashelwako (Distinguished and important guests)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngaphambi kweMphi Yelive Yesibili, ngelikhulu lesi-19 noma 20. Lamahhotela bekalapho bantfu labanjingile nalabadvumile bangaleso sikhatsi bebahlala khona, futsi bekaba nedzawo lekahle yekuhlala nebusuku lobumnandzi. Ngisho noma ngalokuvamile lendzawo iyemuntfu lotsite, ngaletinye tikhatsi kulaliswa bomengameli labavakashile kuyo nalabanye bantfu lababaluleke.""

This translates to: ""Before the Second World War, they were hotels where distinguished and important people stayed at that time, and they had a good place to stay and spend a pleasant night. Although usually the place was for a wealthy person, sometimes it was also hosted by the president and visited by other important people.""

Options A, B, and D are not mentioned in the passage as features that *could* be found in the hotel's guest list.  The passage specifically highlights the presence of distinguished guests.



"
"Ngekuya ngekwatiswa lokukulesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako tivakashi tasehhotela lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi tikubeke embili?","The answer is **B: Sitolo sekudlela lesinashefu lovelele (A restaurant with a renowned chef)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes old hotels as having a distinguished atmosphere, historical significance, and often, a renowned restaurant. This restaurant, with a renowned chef, would be a fitting continuation of the hotel's legacy of offering a special and memorable experience to guests. The passage emphasizes the luxurious aspect of these hotels, and a renowned restaurant fits that description perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Imphahla yakudzala kuyo yonkhe indzawo (An antique shop in every area):** While old hotels *might* have antique shops, it's not a defining characteristic or a logical continuation of the hotel's established luxury.
*   **C: Indzawo yekuphumula lenetekutijabulisa kwasebusuku (A relaxing nighttime entertainment venue):** While entertainment is a plus, the core of these hotels is their history, atmosphere, and often, exceptional dining.
*   **D: Emanani lafinyelelelako emagumbi (Affordable room prices):** The passage describes hotels that cater to wealthy travelers. Affordable prices are the opposite of what these hotels represent.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokufanele igwenywe tivakashi letivakashela iGreenland?","The correct answer is **A: Tindzawo letitsite letatiwa ngekuba nelizinga lelisetulu lebugebengu**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bugebengu nebutsakatsi kuvamisile kubantfu labavela kulamanye mave, akwatiwa kangako eGreenland. Ngisho nasemadolobheni, kute “tindzawo letineludlame.” Simo selitulu kuphela kwengoti labangakalungeli labatobhekana nayo.""  This translates to: ""Crime and theft are common among people from other regions, not so well known in Greenland. Even in the cities, there are ""crime areas."" Only a small part of the government deals with offenders.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuphatsa timphahla letisindzako, njengobe ngalokuvamile kushisa umnyaka wonkhe** - While it's mentioned that warm clothes are needed in winter, the text doesn't say that *expensive* clothes should be avoided. It says warm clothes in general.
*   **C: Kulindzela kutsi utosebenta njengobe ulapho, ngobe i-inthanethi ingase ingabi nemandla** - The text mentions internet access issues but doesn'"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi kube yinkinga kubantfu labavakashela iGreenland bangakatilungiseleli?","The correct answer is **A: Timbuzulwne lokutsiwa ngemaNordic (Nordic ticks)**.

The text specifically mentions that when visiting Greenland during the summer (especially if staying overnight), you should be aware of and prepared for Nordic ticks. It states they are common and can lead to a lack of sleep and health problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bugebengu (Crime):** While crime exists, the text says it's primarily a concern for people coming from other places and isn't widely known in Greenland.
*   **C: Simo selitulu (Samoes):** The text mentions that people from other areas are not well known in Greenland.
*   **D: Bantfu bendzawo (Local people):** The text talks about understanding the local culture, but it does not identify local people as an obstacle to consider.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako nyalo lokusetjentiswa njengendzawo yetitolo?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Nyalo kusebenta njengeplaza lesemkhatsini, futsi kunetintfo letinyenti letentekako, emini nasebusuku. Kunetidzawo letinyenti tekudlela letiseceleni kwalengadze, futsi ntsambama nasebusuku kuvame kuba nemakhonsathi amahhala laba khona kuletindzawo."" (It is always used as a central square, and many things happen there, day and night. There are interesting restaurants and bars, and in the evenings and at night there are often free concerts in these places.)

This directly describes the function of the Jardín de la Unión. While the Alley of the Kiss is a specific feature *within* the Jardín de la Unión, the question asks about the overall place that's used for events and activities.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungatfolakali e-Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **D: Sakhiwo lesizala sebantfu labashintje inkholo (A structure built by people who changed religion)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Jardín de la Unión was built around the Templo de San Diego, which is a 17th-century church. 
* The church is described as the ""most beautiful structure"" and the ""focal point"" of the square.
* Option D directly reflects this information about the church's history and its role as a symbol of religious change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lithende leliphakatsi lelinemakhonsthi (A square with concerts):** The text mentions ""free concerts"" happening in the square, but doesn't say the square *itself* is a venue for concerts.
* **B: Likhaya letindzaba telutsandvo letindzala (A house of love where couples are born):** This refers to Callejon del Beso, a separate feature of Jardín de la Unión.
* **C: Titolo tekudlela letibuke ingadzi (Restaurants with a view):** The text mentions ""restaurants nearby,"" but not specifically those with a view.

* **The passage states:** ""Kukhuphuka intsaba lilanga lonkhe uhamba endzaweni lengasimatima kangako kudzinga kulungiselela lokuncane, futsi noma ngubani lophilile ngekwelizinga lelisesilinganisweni angakujabulela.""  This directly supports option C, which says people with moderate fitness levels can enjoy it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuncane kutilungiselela lokudzingekako nawutohamba endleleni lemelula:**  The passage focuses on sun exposure and general preparation, not specifically difficult terrain.
* **B: Emabanga ayashiyana, kodvwa entelwe kutsi ahlanganiswe ngelilanga linye:** The passage talks about the sun being out *all day*, not about layers changing.
* **D: Kuhamba emini akusiyo intfo lekahle leyentiwa ngaphandle kumindeni lenebantfwana:**  The passage doesn't mention the best time of day. It actually suggests even young children can enjoy a day outside.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho luhambo lwasemini ludzinga khona kutilungiselela lokuncane?","The correct answer is **C: Nangabe bantfwana nabo baya kuloluhambo (If children are going on the trip)**.

The text states: ""Imindeni lenebantfwana labancane ingase idzinge kulungiselela kakhudlwana..."" (Families with small children may need to prepare more...).  This directly answers the question of when extra preparation is needed.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nangabe loyo lohambako acinile emtimbeni (If the person going is carrying a torch):** The text doesn't mention carrying a torch.
*   **B: Nangabe kutakwentiwa endleleni lemelula (If the path is rough):** While a rough path might require some preparation, the text focuses on children as the primary reason for extra preparation.
*   **D: Nangabe lokuhamba kwenteka endzaweni lengekwemvelo (If the trip is taking place in an unnatural environment):** The text discusses natural environments (fields, meadows) where the activity takes place."
Uyini umehluko etsafeni laseRogaland nome Agder nalicatsaniswa nayo yonkhe iNorway?,"The correct answer is **A: Linetihlahla (They have mountains)**.

The text explicitly states: ""ERogaland nase-Agder ngalokuvamile abitwa ngekutsi """"hei"""" lokusho indzawo lete tihlahla lembonywe timbhali."" (Rogaland and Agder are often called ""hei,"" which means the mountainous region described by writers.)

While the other options might be true of parts of Norway, the text specifically links Rogaland and Agder to being mountainous (""tihlahla"").
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kulolu lokulandzelako lokungeke kube ngulokujwayelekile ngeNorway?","The correct answer is **C: Ema-fjords lehlelako (Fjord landscapes)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ngalokuvamile kubhekiselwa kuwo ngekutsi """"yi-vidde"""" lokusho indzawo lenkhulu, levulekile lete sihlahla, futsi lete nemincele."" This describes *vidde*, which are open, treeless plains.
* **The text also mentions:** ""ERogaland nase-Agder ngalokuvamile abitwa ngekutsi """"hei"""" lokusho indzawo lete tihlahla lembonywe timbhali.""  This refers to the vast, open landscapes of Rogaland and Agder, which are *vidde*.
* **Fjords** are long, narrow inlets with steep cliffs, carved by glaciers. While beautiful, they are *not* described as the typical landscape associated with ""vidde"" in the text. They are more closely associated with coastal Norway.

Therefore, option C is the most unlikely to be a typical Norwegian landscape according to the provided text.
"
Kunini lapho tivakashi letinesifiso sekuntjuza echweni letingavakashela khona titeshi letisegcumeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Ebusika (Winter)**.

The text states: ""Kodvwa, kunebuhle nekutsandzeka lokuhlukile ebusika..."" which translates to ""But, there is a special beauty and charm in winter...""  This directly indicates that winter is the ideal time for visitors to see the flower blossoms.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho kuba netivakashi letinyenti khona etiteshini letisegcumeni?","The correct answer is **A: Ngesikhatsi selichwa lelinemandla (During the cool season)**.

The text states that Linani's summer holidays in India are unique and that the weather in winter is beautiful and pleasant, with enough sunshine for outdoor games. This implies the peak tourist season is during the cooler/winter months.
"
Yini lokufanele ugweme kuyenta nawunelitsemba lekutfola sikebhe lesifuna lusito?,"The correct answer is **B: Kutayelana nabokaputeni (Negotiating with captains)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes trying to find a passenger for a ferry. It emphasizes talking to various people – ticket buyers, passengers, and even those selling goods near the ferry terminal. However, the question asks what you should *avoid* doing.  Negotiating with captains is not mentioned or encouraged in the passage, and it's unlikely to be a productive strategy for quickly finding a passenger.  It's a potentially irrelevant and possibly disruptive action.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kwehla wenyuka kuma-dock (Going up and down the docks):** This is a reasonable activity to be doing as a ferry operator, as it's part of the job.
* **C: Kukhangisa ngemsebenti lowentako (Advertising the service):**  The passage encourages talking to people, which could be considered a form of advertising, so this isn't something to avoid.
* **D: Kungabanaki labanye labacela kugibela tikebhe (Not refusing other ticket requests):**  It's important to be polite and not refuse ticket requests, as it might lead to finding a passenger.



"
Yini lokufanele uyente nawuseceleni kwebashayeli betikebhe nawusafuna tikembe letidzinga lusito endzaweni yekupaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Chumana nebashayeli bemikhumbi**.

Here's why:

The text describes the initial steps a hitchhiker should take: making themselves visible, interacting with other passengers, and asking drivers at the tobacco shop.  The goal is to find a ride.  If a driver doesn't offer a ride, the best course of action is to politely engage with them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hlala ungabonakali (Stay hidden):** This is the opposite of what the text advises. Hitchhiking requires being visible.
*   **C: Yani kuphela kubantfu nabasahlala tikebhe tabo (Only talk to people and those sitting in the bus):**  The text explicitly encourages talking to *many* people, including drivers at the tobacco shop.
*   **D: Gwema kucela kugibela kuletinye tikebhe (Avoid asking for a ride to another bus):** The text mentions asking drivers at the tobacco shop, implying that asking for rides to different destinations is part of the process.

Nguyiphi indzawo lengakhanga tivakashi letinesifiso sekutfola umlandvo wekubuswa kwesichingi?,"The correct answer is **C: Inkhaba yelidolobha laseHong Kong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lena yindzawo lapho baseBrithani labangena ngenkhani kuyo bayenta yabo ngako ngangabe ufuna bufakazi balendzawo kutsi yatsatfwa ngubani ekucaleni, lena yindzawo lekahle longacala kuyo."" (This is the place where the British came in and made it theirs, if you want proof of which place was colonized first, this is a good place to visit.) This directly refers to the **city harbor** as the location where the history of colonization is evident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lugu loluseNyakatfo (Maritime History):** While maritime history is part of Hong Kong's history, the passage focuses specifically on the *colonization* aspect.
* **B: Indzawo lengaselwandle lokutsitwa yi-Kowloon (Kowloon waterfront):** The passage mentions the Kowloon waterfront but primarily focuses on the city harbor.
* **D: Sikhumulo semikhumbi lokutsiwa yi-Victoria Harbor (Victoria Harbor ferry terminal):** This is a specific point within Victoria Harbor, but not the place that embodies the colonial history being asked about.



"
Nguyiphi indzawo lengakhanga sivakashi lesitsandza indzawo lenhle?,"The correct answer is **A: Sikhumulo semikhumbi lokutsiwa yi-Victoria Harbor**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Takhiwo letiseHong Kong tifananiswa nelishadi lelihle lelentiwa libonakale kuba khona kwemanti lasuka eVictoria Harbour.""  This translates to: ""The scenery of Hong Kong is likened to a beautiful painting that is visible because of the waters from Victoria Harbour."" This directly refers to the Victoria Harbour waterfront.

Option B, ""I-Hong Kong proper"" is too broad. While the text describes Hong Kong Island (and Kowloon), it doesn't point to the *specific* area that's a popular spot for viewing the scenery.

Options C and D are less accurate. While Hong Kong Island and Kowloon are mentioned, the text highlights the waterfront *along* Victoria Harbour. Kowloon's waterfront is also mentioned as another good spot.
"
Yini letinye tihlalo temahhashi letinayo kuze tivikele kutsi lunyawo lwemgibeli lubanjwe yifulemu yekufaka tinyawo?,"The correct answer is **C: Emafulemu ekufaka tinyawo lentiwe ngesikhumba**.

Here's why:

The passage states the problem is that a cow's legs can get caught in the seat of the chair. Option C directly addresses this by suggesting footrests attached to the chair's body, preventing the legs from getting trapped.  The passage also mentions safety features in English chairs to prevent the seat from tipping backward, further supporting the need for footrests or similar mechanisms.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Emasoli lamancane (Small feet):**  Smaller feet wouldn't inherently prevent legs from getting caught.
* **B: Tindvuku tekuphepha (Safety pads):**  Safety pads might offer some cushioning, but they wouldn't solve the problem of legs getting trapped.
* **D: Kutinta lokukhulu (Painting brightly):** Bright colors offer no safety benefit.



"
Ngusiphi sici selibhudzi lemgibeli welihhasi lesikhulisa lizinga lekuphepha nakasebentisa emafulemu ekufaka tinyawo?,"The correct answer is **D: Isoli levulekile (Open sole)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kunciphisa ematfuba alengoti, tinyatselo tokuphepha letinengi kufanele titsatfwe. Kwekucala, bagibeli labanyenti bagcoka emabhudze lanesitsedze. Lokulandzelako, tihlalo, kakhulu tihlalo taseNgilandi, tinemigoco yekuphepha lebangela kutsi situbhu sesikhumba siwe kulesihlalo uma sidvonselwa emuva ngumgibeli lowako.""

This translates to: ""To reduce the risk to the driver, many safety measures should be taken. First, many drivers complain of discomfort and fatigue. Secondly, seats, particularly the English seat, have safety features that cause the footrest to retract when the driver is moved backward by the animal.""

The key is the ""footrest retracts."" This implies the animal's foot could get trapped in a closed sole. An **open sole** would allow the animal's foot to easily slip out, preventing it from getting stuck and potentially causing the animal to panic and bolt.



Therefore, an **open sole** is a safety feature designed to reduce the risk when using footrests.

* The passage also mentions the network connects tourists with locals offering places to stay.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tindiza letishiphile:** The passage doesn't mention shipping.
* **C: Kuvakashiswa bantfu bendzawo:** While locals *might* host tourists, the network's primary function isn't to *send* locals to visit.
* **D: Kuhlangana nalabanye nabo labavakashele indzawo lefanako:** While meeting others is a benefit, the lodging information is the core offering.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Tivakashi ngaso sonkhe sikhatsi tinikwa imininingwane yebantfu bendzawo labatotisita:** The text doesn't say *always*. It says the schedule is provided, and the schedule contains the information. There's no guarantee it's *always* provided.
* **B: Lamanye emanethiwekhi angase adzinge kucinisekiswa lokwengetiwe kwetivakashi:** The text doesn't mention anything about verification processes for travelers.
* **D: Kuphawula lokwentiwa mayelana nebantfu bendzawo labanakekela tivakashi kuyatfolakala ngaletinye tikhatsi:** While the text does mention locals caring for travelers, it doesn't say information *about* them is always available. The focus is on the traveler's schedule.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the text."
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesivakashi lokunematfuba lamancane kutsi ungalutfola egumbini lelihlanganyelwako?","The correct answer is **C: Sivakashi lesihamba nebantfwana labancane**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that families with children are ""not common"" but some hotels *do* allow them.
* The question asks about the type of visitor that is *least likely* to be found in a room at this hostelry.
* Therefore, the least likely type of visitor would be families with young children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sivakashi lesisekucaleni kweminyaka yemashumi lamabili** (Visitors in their early twenties) - The text says this is a *common* type of visitor.
* **B: Sivakashi lesihamba sodvwana** (Solo travelers) - The text doesn't say whether solo travelers are common or not.
* **D: Sivakashi lesisemkhatsini weminyaka yemashumi lamatsatfu** (Visitors in their thirties) - The text doesn't mention this age group.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngubani lokunematfuba lamakhulu ekutsi ahlala ehhotela?","The correct answer is **B: Labatsatfu labaneminyaka lengu-22 labahamba ndzawonye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emahostela anaka kakhulu bantfu labasha - luhlobo lwetivakasha letivamile tiseminyakeni yemashumi lamabili..."" (Hostels are very popular with young people - a common type of tourist in their twenties...).

This directly indicates that young people in their twenties are the most common visitors.  Option B reflects this.  The passage also mentions that families with children are *not* common.

Therefore, options A and C are incorrect because they don't align with the passage's emphasis on young adults. Option D is incorrect because the passage says families aren't common.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lakuchaza kahle kuphonsa i-boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: Ngaso sonkhe sikhasi itobuya esandleni sakho nayiphonswe kahle** (It always returns to your hand if thrown well).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that a boomerang only returns *if* thrown correctly.**  It states that many boomerangs in Australia don't return and that beginners shouldn't try throwing them without practicing. Option A directly reflects this core idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yetayeleke kakhulu kubantfu bendzawo kunasetivakashini** (It's much easier for locals than for tourists). While this might be true, it's not the *main* point the passage is making about throwing a boomerang. The passage focuses on technique, not on who's better at it.
* **C: Akasimanyenti ema-boomerang latfolakalako e-Australia** (Boomerangs aren't that common in Australia). The passage implies boomerangs are common, but that many don't return due to poor technique.
* **D: Ngulamanye ema-boomerang kuphela lakhona kubuya** (Only some boomerangs return). The passage says many boomerangs don't return, which contradicts this statement.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokusetjentiswa kakhulu ekudleni kwesiJavanese?,"The text states: ""...terutama gula aren (gula tebu yang difermentasi dari pohon kelapa) serta gula merah (gula tebu yang tidak difermentasi dari pohon kelapa)...""

This translates to ""...primarily palm sugar (sugar cane that is fermented from coconut trees) and brown sugar (sugar cane that is not fermented from coconut trees)...""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Shukela wekhokhonathi** (Palm sugar/Coconut sugar). While the text mentions both palm sugar and brown sugar, the inclusion of ""gula aren"" (palm sugar) is specifically mentioned as being fermented from coconut trees, making it the closest match to the options.  Since ""shukela wekhokhonathi"" directly translates to coconut sugar, it's the most accurate choice.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, sifo lesitsatsalwanako sandza kanjani?","The correct answer is **A: Ngebantfu labanaso (From people who have it)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sifo lesitsatselwanako sifo lesendluliseleka kulomunye ngekutsi abe sedvutane nemuntfu lesimphetse."" which translates to ""Contagious diseases are transmitted from one person to another through contact with an infected person.""

While bacteria (C) can *cause* contagious diseases, the passage explains *how* the disease spreads – through people. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lebeyingatiwa kutsi ibangela sifo lesitsatselwanako?","The correct answer is **B: Emagciwane (Viruses)**.

The passage states: ""Sifo lesitsatselwanako sifo lesibangwa ligciwane kungaba yivariyasi ibhakthiriya ifangasi noma tilwanyana letimunya ingati."" This translates to: ""Contagious diseases are caused by various viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites.""

Therefore, viruses are one of the things that can cause contagious diseases, as mentioned in the text.  The other options (bacteria, fungi, parasites, and hunting) are not specifically mentioned as causes of contagious diseases in this passage.
"
Kukusiphi simo lapho kukhetsa khona i-web proxy kune-VPN kwenele kumuntfu?,"The correct answer is **C: Lomuntfu ngalokuyinhloko ukhatsateke ngekuhambiswa kwatiswa kwe-http.**

Here's why:

* **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** encrypts *all* your internet traffic, protecting everything you do online – browsing, apps, everything. It's a comprehensive security solution.
* **Web Proxy** only handles traffic for specific protocols, most commonly HTTP. It doesn't encrypt everything like a VPN.

Therefore, if a user *primarily* wants to bypass restrictions on HTTP traffic (like accessing a website blocked in their region), a web proxy is sufficient and less resource-intensive than a VPN.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umuntfu ufuna kuphambukisa konkhe kwatiswa:**  This describes a need for a VPN, not a web proxy.
* **B: Umuntfu ukhatsate kakhulu ngekuvinjelwa nekuhlolwa kwetintfo takhe:**  This also points towards needing a VPN for comprehensive privacy and security.
* **D: Lokwentiwa ngulomuntfu kudzinga i-bandwidth lenemandla lasetulu ngalokusesilinganisweni:**  Web proxies generally require less bandwidth and processing power than VPNs. If bandwidth is limited, a web proxy would be the better choice.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana nema-VPN nema-web proxies?","The correct answer is **A: Ngalokuvamile ema-VPN aniketa i-bandwidth lesetulu kunema-web proxies** (Usually VPNs have higher bandwidth than web proxies).

Here's why:

* The text states that VPNs ""Bawati kahle emawebhusayithi latsite ngenca yetizatfu letinyenti: Emalayini e-Inthaneti bawahambisa ngalenye indlela, hhayi nje kuphela i-http. Ngalokuvamile baniketa lusito loluphakeme nalolusezingeni lelisetulu."" (They work well with websites that use various types of traffic: Internet lines transmit in other ways, not just HTTP. They usually have a higher protocol and level of security.)  This implies a higher bandwidth capability.
* Web proxies are generally less secure and can be slower than VPNs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ema-web proxies angeke akhone kuhambisa konkhe kwatiswa** (Web proxies can't transmit everything that's sent). While this *can* be true, the text doesn't directly support this statement. It focuses on the *capability* of VPNs.
* **C: Ema-web proxies anekhwalithi lephansi nakacatsaniswa nema-VPN** (Web proxies have lower quality and are inferior to VPNs). The text *hints* at VPNs being superior in security and bandwidth but doesn't explicitly state that web proxies have *low* quality.
* **D: Ema-VPN angahambisa kwatiswa kwe-http kuphela** (VPNs can only transmit HTTP traffic). The text explicitly states that VPNs can handle traffic beyond just HTTP.



Therefore, option A is the most directly supported conclusion from the text."
Yini levumela umuntfu kutsi asebentise inkapani yelucingo ngephandle kwendzawo lahlala kuyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Tincingo letihanjiswa nge-inthanethi (Internet-based telephony)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ngoba tincingo tihlanganiswe ne-Inthanethi, akunasidzingo sekutsi usebentise lucingo lenkhampani yalapho uhlala khona noma lapho uvakasha khona."" (Because telephones are connected to the Internet, there is no need to use a phone company from where you live or where you are visiting.) This directly addresses the ability to use phone services across different locations due to internet connectivity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tinombolo tetincingo temhlaba wonkhe (Worldwide telephone numbers):** While having a global number *can* be helpful, it's not the fundamental reason why you can use a company's service from anywhere. The underlying reason is the internet connection.
* **C: Emasethelayithi (Websites):** Websites are used to access the service, but the core enabling factor is the internet connection.
* **D: Tincingo tema-PSTN (PSTN telephones):** PSTN refers to the traditional public switched telephone network. The passage discusses *internet-based* telephony, which is a departure from the PSTN.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokungase kudzingeke yentiwe kuze kungene letinye tincingo?","The correct answer is **A: Tsenga inombolo yemhlaba wonkhe**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Esikhatsini lesinyenti, kufuneka utsenge inombolo yamhlabawonkhe levumela tincingo tePSTN kutsi tikushayele."" (Often, you need to purchase an international number to allow PSTN phones to call you.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sebentisa inkapani yetincingo yasendzaweni:** The passage explicitly states that you don't *need* to use a local company's phone number, as you can use a virtual number.
* **C: Tfola inombolo endzaweni yakini:** While you *could* get a local number, the passage says it's not *necessary*.  The core problem addressed is needing a number that allows international calls *to you*.
* **D: Tsenga lucingo lwe-PSTN:** The passage says you *don't* need to purchase a PSTN phone line. The issue is with allowing calls to your phone number.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungayichazi kahle indlela yekubita emagama esiTaliyane?,"The correct answer is **B: Linyenti lemagama libitwa ngendlela lelibhalwe ngayo (Many words are pronounced as they are spelled).**

Here's why:

The question highlights that Italian pronunciation is *not* always straightforward. It specifically mentions that the pronunciation of ""c"" and ""g"" changes depending on the following vowel, and that ""rr"" is pronounced differently than a single ""r.""  It also gives the example of ""caro"" and ""carro"" demonstrating different pronunciations for the same letters.  The core issue is that Italian pronunciation deviates from spelling in many cases.

Option B directly contradicts this core principle. The passage explicitly states that Italian pronunciation *doesn't* always match the spelling. Therefore, the statement ""Many words are pronounced as they are spelled"" is incorrect according to the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bo-r lababili babitwa ngendlela leyehlukule ku-r munye (Both ""bo-r"" are pronounced differently from a single ""r"")**: This aligns with the passage's explanation of how ""r"" sounds can vary.
*   **C: Emagama lanetinhlavu c na-g ayadidana (Words with the letters c and g have variants)**: This is directly mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Indlela emagama lamanyenti labitwa ngayo iyahluka kuye ngankhamisa lolandzelako (The way words with many vowels are pronounced changes from one to the next)**: This is also stated in the passage.



"
Ngutiphi kuletici letilandzelako te-Izmir lesavela ngembi kwesikhatsi samanje?,"The answer is **B: Takhiwo letakhiwe ngengilazi ngembili (Glass and steel constructions)**.

Here's why:

The text mentions that Izmir's architecture is a mix of historical and modern styles, specifically highlighting:

*   **Historical:**  ""Lemigwaco lemikhulu, emabhilidi lafakwe emafasitela lamakhulu netakhiwo tetitolo tekutsenga tesimanje tifakwe luphahla lelunemachashati labovu emdzabu..."" (Great buildings, skyscrapers with large windows and modern shopping center constructions are built on a facade with a tile roof...)
*   **Modern:** ""...lesitfutfukile, nalesiphitsitelako, lesitungeletwe yibheyi lenkhulu netintsaba."" (...innovative, forward-looking, and set against a large bay and mountains.)

The text emphasizes the modern constructions, and the description of ""Takhiwo letakhiwe ngengilazi ngembili"" (Glass and steel constructions) fits perfectly with the image of a modern, European-Mediterranean city. The other options are either too general (A, C) or describe a specific element that's part of the overall facade, but not the defining characteristic of modern Izmir. D, ""Luphahla lolunemathayizi labovu"" (Facade with a tile roof) is a historical architectural element.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasiso sici lesiliciniso nge-Izmir?,"The correct answer is **C: Ungatfola kokubili tikhungo tekutsenga tesimanje kanye nemasontfo lamadzala**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...imakethe yangelikhulu leminyaka lesi-18, futsi netindlu letindzala letisontsela kito emaSulumane nemasontfo lamadzala...""  This directly confirms that you can find both modern shopping centers and old bazaars/markets in Izmir.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Lelidolobha litungelete ibhayi lenkhulu:** While the passage mentions Izmir is located by a large bay, it doesn't emphasize that the *city* is *surrounded* by it. It just says it's *by* the bay.
* **B: Simo siveta iTurkey yemdzabu:** The passage says Izmir has a Mediterranean European atmosphere, *contrasting* with the traditional Turkish one. It doesn't suggest it's located in a dusty region.
* **D: Inesikhu,mulo semikhulu lesisesibili ngebukhulu eTurkey:** The passage says Izmir is the *second* largest city in Turkey by population. This statement is true, but the passage doesn't mention the city being known for its ""charm"" or ""culture"" in the same way it highlights its unique blend of old and new.
"
Ligama lelitsi hanami libhekisela ekubukeni ini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ema-cherry blossoms**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lomcondvo wavela eShayina lapho timbali tema-plum bekutimbali telukhetselo. EJapan, emaphathi ekucala umhleli wawo bekuba ngumbusi atentela yena lephathi nalamanye emalunga ebukhosi eceleni kweNkantolo Yasebukhosini.""

The key phrase is ""timbali tema-plum bekutimbali telukhetselo"" which translates to ""plum blossoms were used for sacrifices."" However, the text also states that the practice evolved in Japan and the question asks what ""hanami"" refers to.  The common understanding and what's implied is that the beautiful blossoms, particularly cherry blossoms (sakura), became central to the hanami tradition in Japan.

Therefore, while the origin is plum blossoms, the term ""hanami"" is most strongly associated with the viewing of **cherry blossoms**.
"
Ngubani lowabamba imicimbi yekucala leyayentelwe kubukwa kwema-cherry blossoms?,"The correct answer is **C: Umbusi waseJapane**.

The text states: ""Emaphathi ekucala umhleli wawo bekuba ngumbusi atentela yena lephathi nalamanye emalunga ebukhosi eceleni kweNkantolo Yasebukhosini."" This translates to ""In the early days, its host was the emperor who hosted the party and other officials in opposition to the Imperial Court."" This clearly indicates the emperor of Japan was the one who initially hosted the cherry blossom viewing parties.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi kuletici letilandzelako teJerusalema lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi sikhange tivakashi?","The best answer is **D: Tindzawo letinyenti temlandvo (Historical Sites)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions the ""tindzawo letinyenti tase-Old City"" as a major draw for tourists. It highlights the city's rich history, historical sites, and cultural landmarks.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kubaluleka kwalelidolobha kutenkholo (Its religious importance):** While the passage emphasizes the religious significance, it doesn't directly say that the religious importance is the *reason* tourists visit.
* **B: Kuba kwalo lidolobha lelikhulu ka-Israyeli (Being the capital of Israel):**  Being the capital is a fact, but not the primary reason people visit.
* **C: Emasiko alo (Its culture):** The passage mentions culture, but it doesn't delve into specific cultural aspects that would be the main draw for tourists.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengentfo iJerusalema leyatiwa ngayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Emandla ayo kutepolitiki (Its political power)**.

Here's why:

The passage heavily emphasizes Jerusalem's religious and historical significance. It details its importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, its spiritual role, and the historical sites within the Old City.  While the passage mentions its popularity as a tourist destination and its historical sites, it *doesn't* discuss its political power.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: Umlandvo wayo lomangalisako (Its amazing history):** The passage explicitly states ""Lidolobha lakadzeni eTintsabeni taseJudiya linemlandvo lomangalisako lokhona kusukela etinkhulungwane teminyaka."" (The ancient city in the Judean Hills has an amazing history dating back thousands of years.)
*   **C: Kubaluleka kwayo kutenkholo (Its religious importance):** The entire passage revolves around Jerusalem's religious significance to different faiths.
*   **D: Tindzawo temasiko (Its cultural sites):** The passage mentions ""tindzawo temasiko"" (cultural sites) and specifically highlights the historical sites within the Old City.



Therefore, the only option *not* mentioned in the passage is its political power."
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesivakashi lolungeke luzuze ngekutsenga i-Wild Card?","The correct answer is **D: Sivakashi lesihlela kuvakashela i-Kruger National Park nalokungenani nalenye iphaki leyodwa.**

Here's why:

The text states that a Wild Card allows access to ""maPaki Esive aseNingizimu Afrika"" (South African National Parks). Option D is the only one that describes a visitor planning to visit Kruger *and* at least one other park, thus qualifying for the Wild Card benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sivakasi lesihlela kuvakashela ema-SANPark lamanyenti nakungenteka** - This is too broad. The Wild Card benefits are specifically related to access to *selected* parks, not all SANParks.
* **B: Sivakashi lesivakashela i-Kruger National Park kuphela** - While a Wild Card *does* allow access to Kruger, the question asks which visitor *wouldn't* benefit. Someone only visiting Kruger wouldn't maximize the Wild Card's value, as it's designed for multiple park visits.
* **C: Sivakashi lesikhatsateke ngetindleko tasephaki** -  The text mentions fees for entry, but being budget-conscious doesn't preclude someone from benefiting from a Wild Card.



"
Ngumaphi emavi langayichazi kahle i-Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **B: Tilwane tiyehlukahlukana etindzaweni letinyenti talephaki (Animals are diverse in different parts of the park).**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Lepaki ingu-19,500 km² futsi yehlukaniswe yaba tincenye letehlukene letingu-14, incenye ngayinye ineluhlobo lolutsite letilwane tasendle."" (The park is 19,500 km² and divided into 14 different sections, each with a different type of wildlife habitat.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ibhekwa njengendzawo lehamba embili eNingizimu Afrikha ngekukhanga tivakashi (It is seen as a two-way place in South Africa by attracting visitors):** While it attracts visitors, the text doesn't highlight it as a ""two-way place"" in that sense. It focuses on its status as a protected area and wildlife habitat.
* **C: Iyiphaki lencane kunato tonkhe e-South African National Parks (It is smaller than all of the South African National Parks):** The text actually provides the size (19,500 km²) which implies it's a significant park, not a small one.
* **D: Tivakashi tiyakhona kungena kuyo ngekutsi titsenge i-Wild Card (Visitors can re-enter by purchasing a Wild Card):** The text *does* mention Wild Cards, but it's primarily to explain how visitors can access multiple parks in South Africa, not specifically how they can re-enter Kruger.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungenteka kubangele ingoti kubantfu labacancako kuto tonkhe tincenye talentsaba letehlela kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuba manti (Because of the altitude)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the symptoms of altitude sickness, specifically difficulty breathing and a feeling of being out of breath. It mentions that people might not be able to ascend for 45 minutes and that the air is thin.  Altitude sickness is primarily caused by the reduced oxygen levels at high altitudes.  

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Ematje lokuhanjwa kuwo (In the walking paths):** While the paths might be challenging, they aren't the direct cause of altitude sickness.
* **C: Imihume lemincane (The small caves):**  The caves are mentioned as potential places to rest, but not as the cause of the problem.
* **D: Emakhebuli ensimbi (The metal railings):** The railings are for safety, and while the metal itself could theoretically have some impact, it's not the main reason for altitude sickness.

Therefore, the most logical and direct cause of the described symptoms is the reduced oxygen availability at the altitude.



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langakuchazi kahle kukhuphukela kwentsaba i-Machu Picchu lechazwe kulesicephu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngisho nebacanci labanemandla kungenteka baphelelwe ngumoya (Even the strongest people can run out of breath)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lindzela kuphelelwa ngumoya, futsi uyanaka etikhuphukelweni, kukhulukati uma kunemanti, njengoba kungaba yingoti masinyane."" This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kute kwekubambelela kuto tonkhe tincenye letehlelako (The railings are in all the steep parts)** - While railings are present, the passage doesn't say they are *everywhere* in the steep parts.
* **C: Kufanele wendlule umhume etulu (You must descend into the small tunnel above)** - The passage says you *can* descend into the tunnel, but it's not stated as a mandatory part of the ascent.
* **D: Tindzawo letehlelako tiba yingoti nakumanti (The steep areas are gold and wet)** - The passage mentions the steep areas can be wet *especially* with dew, but doesn't claim they are gold.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasiyo intfo lehamba embili ekudleni kwesi-Majorcan ?","The correct answer is **C: Lokusanhlavu (Liver)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Majorcan cuisine features seafood, meatballs (tibhidvo), and meat (especially lamb). However, it *doesn't* mention liver as a common ingredient.  Therefore, liver is the unusual item in the list.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe ekwatisweni lokukulesicephu, ngumaphi emavi langasili liciniso ngekudla kwesihangi?","The correct answer is **A: Ihangi yekushisa kwemhlaba isebentisa ematje lashisako lasuka emlilweni kuze kushishiswe umgodzi.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Lomgodzi kungenteka ushisiswa ngematje lashisako labaselwe, noma kushisa kwemhlaba lokwenta letindzawo talomhlaba tishise ngalokutentakalelako."" (This oven can be heated by hot stones from lava, or by geothermal heat to make these earth areas heat naturally.)
* Option A accurately reflects this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ihangi lesebentisa ematje lashisako iyatfolakal eWellington** - The text mentions Rotorua as a location with these ovens, but doesn't state they are specifically available in Wellington.
* **C: Kudla kwakusihlwa lokosiwe kuvamise kuphekwa ngehangi** - The text says the ovens were historically used by Maori, but doesn't state they are *only* used for slow-cooked meals.
* **D: Ihangi yekushisa kwemhlaba ingatfolakala eRotorua** - While the text mentions Rotorua as a place with these ovens, it doesn't say the ovens themselves are available to the public *in* Rotorua. It describes Rotorua as *having* them.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungabalwanga njengendlela levamile yekushisisa umgodzi wehangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Igesi**.

The text explicitly states that geothermal kitchens are heated by geothermal steam or by steam created by heating the earth. It also mentions that steam is often created by boiling water with rocks.  Options B, C, and D (all variations of ""geothermal steam/rocks"") are all methods of heating a geothermal kitchen.  Natural gas is *not* mentioned as a common method.
"
Yini lengase iholele ekucashelweni lokukhetsekile kwe-monk nome i-nun?,"The correct answer is **D: Kugcoka siketi lesifika ngetulu kwemadvolo** (Wearing a scarf that covers the head).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Tindlu letinyenti temasontfo tiyabaniketa bantfu besifazane tindvwangu nangabe bete bangenato, kodvwa uma uta neyakho, ikakhulukati lenembala lokhanyako, lilunga lalelisontfo lotalikhandza ekungeneni litawumamatseka.""  This translates to ""Monasteries require women to cover their heads. Even if you don't have one, if you have one, especially a light-colored one, the monastery's head covering will be seized from you upon entry.""  And later, it mentions men needing to cover their faces with scarves.  Therefore, a scarf covering the head is the key element leading to being stopped.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kugcoka libhali lelivalako** (Wearing a closed robe): While robes are part of the attire, the text focuses on the head covering.
* **B: Kuvala emahlombe** (Covering the shoulders):  The text mentions covering the face for men, but doesn't explicitly state covering shoulders for women as a requirement for entry.
* **C: Kuboleka libhayi endlini yema-nun** (Staying in a nun's house):  This is a place of residence, not a requirement for entry.



"
Nguyiphi kuletimphahla letilandzelako lekunematfuba lamancane ekutsi ingatfolakala kuze ibolekwe endlini yema-nun? ,"The correct answer is **A: Tiketi (Tickets)**.

The text explicitly states that women need to purchase tickets to cover their heads and chests when entering the church. The other options (khindi - scarves, imabhuluko - vests, imabhayi - robes) are mentioned as things worn *with* the tickets, or as part of the required attire, but the core item one *needs to obtain* is the ticket itself.
"
Kunini lapho sivakashi singaba nematfuba labanyenti ekubuka tinkhanyenti nasisavakashele tindzawo tase-Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngetinyanga tasebusika (In winter)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that polar night (when the sun doesn't rise) occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic during winter.
* The passage further says that the darkness of polar night is ideal for viewing the Aurora.
* Therefore, the best time to have more opportunities to see the Northern Lights in the Antarctic is during winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngetinyanga tasehlobo (In summer):** Summer in the Antarctic experiences continuous daylight, making aurora viewing impossible.
* **B: Lapho lendzawo ite khona bantfu labanyenti (Where there are many people):** The passage says that the limited population in these regions is actually *beneficial* for aurora viewing.
* **D: Nangabe lizinga lekungcoliswa kwekukhanya liphansi (When the light pollution is low):** While low light pollution is *helpful* for aurora viewing, the *primary* reason for increased viewing opportunities is the polar night, which only occurs in winter.
"
Kunini lapho lucingo lwesethelayithi lungeke lulunge khona kutsasa sikhundla samahlalekhikhini?,"The correct answer is **A: Nangabe umugcwa wesethelayithi wekubuka ungase uvimbeke (If the satellite view is blocked).**

Here's why:

The passage states that satellite signals rely on a clear line of sight to the satellite. If something is obstructing the satellite view (like a building, trees, or even heavy cloud cover), the signal will be blocked and the device won't be able to connect.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Nangabe lendzawo ichele kakhulu (If the area is too crowded):** While a very dense environment might *affect* signal strength, it doesn't necessarily *block* the signal in the way a physical obstruction would.
*   **C: Nangabe lutosetjentiswa ngephandle (If it is used outdoors):**  The passage describes satellite internet as being used in remote locations *outdoors*. Outdoor use is the intended environment.
*   **D: Nangabe luhambo lunetidzingo letitsite temadatha (If the trip requires a significant amount of data):** Data needs are a matter of cost and plan selection, not a limitation of the satellite connection itself.



"
Kunini lapho lucingo lwesethelayithi lungaba ncono khona kunamahlalekhikhini?,"The correct answer is **B: Eluhambeni lwesikebhe (On a ship).**

Here's why:

The text specifically states that satellite communication is useful in situations where cellular networks are unavailable.  A ship at sea is a prime example of such a situation.  Cellular coverage is often limited or nonexistent at sea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nawusavakashelele edolobheni (When you visit a city):** Cities typically have good cellular coverage.
* **C: Nangabe idatha ingadzingeki (When data is not needed):**  This is irrelevant to the *usefulness* of satellite communication.  You might not need data, but satellite communication still provides a vital connection.
* **D: Nangabe kunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi mahlalekhikhini utobamba (When there are many opportunities to catch a signal on a mobile phone):** This is the opposite of the situation where satellite communication is beneficial.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**.
"
Kushayisana ngenca yaloku lokulandzelako kwaholela ekwakhiweni kweTransnistria Republic?,"The correct answer is **B: Buve (Ethnic diversity)**.

The text states: ""IMoldova inebantfu labanebuve lobuhlukene ibukene nenkinga yekulwa ngebuve."" (Moldova has a diverse ethnic population and a problem with ethnic conflict.)  This conflict is directly linked to the creation of Transnistria.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako iTransnistria Republic lenako lokwehlukile kuyo yonkhe iMoldova?  ,"The correct answer is **C: Kucashelwa yi-UN**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ayinakwa njengelilunga laMhlabuhlangene."" This means Transnistria Republic is *not* recognized as a legitimate member of the United Nations.  The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

*   **A: Lulwimi:** The text says Russian is widely used, but doesn't state it's different from the rest of Moldova.
*   **B: Inkholo:** The text says the faith is generally the same (Eastern Orthodox).
*   **D: Imali:** The text mentions they have their own money, but doesn't indicate it's different from the rest of Moldova.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho umuntfu kufanele avakashele khona iMontevideo nangabe afuna kubalekela umoya?","The correct answer is **D: Ngetinyanga tasebusika taseMontevideo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sikhatsi sasebusika singabandza kakhulu; emazinga ekushisa angehla lishubise umnkatja, kodvwa umoya nekushisa nasekuhlangene kungenta kube nconywana kunaloko lokushiwo yintfo yekukala lizinga lekushisa."" This indicates that the winter in Montevideo, while cold, can also be windy and potentially uncomfortable. Therefore, someone wanting to escape the heat should visit during the winter months.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho umuntfu kufanele avakashele khona iMontevideo nangabe atsandza simo selitulu lesipholile?","The correct answer is **A: Nakusehlobo eMontevideo**.

The text states: ""EMontovideo enhlanzeni; etinyangeni tasehlobo, emazinga ekushisa langetulu kwa +30°C ajwayelekile."" This translates to: ""In Montevideo during the summer; in the summer months, temperatures are usually above +30°C."" This indicates that summer in Montevideo is a good time to visit if you want warm, pleasant weather.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungahlotjaniswa nemuntfu lowenta buciko begrafithi, ngalokuphambene nekucekelwa phansi kwemphahla?","The correct answer is **A: Imicimbi yegrafithi (Graffiti events)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that there are now ""approved graffiti artists, graffiti events, and ""legal"" walls."" This means some graffiti is being legitimized and organized, moving away from being considered vandalism.
* Options B, C, and D all describe forms of graffiti that *are* considered vandalism and not part of the approved scene.

Therefore, graffiti events are presented as something distinct from illegal tagging and vandalism, and are being embraced as a form of art.
"
Ngusiphi sici semikhosi yemiculo letinye tihambeli letisitsatsa njengencenye lebalulekile?,"The correct answer is **C: Umculo lodlala kuze kube sebusuku**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngisho nobe umculo endzaweni yawo ungaphela, kutaba netindzawo emcimbini letitochubeka tidlala umculo kute kube sebusuku."" (Even if the music in their place ends, there are places in the event that continue to play music until nightfall.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuletsa bantfwana labancane** - While some festivals may be family-friendly, the text doesn't mention this as a universal characteristic.
*   **B: Kukhempa kuleyo ndzawo** - The text mentions campsites for families, but not as a general feature of all music festivals.
*   **D: Kungena kusesenesikhatsi** - The text doesn't discuss the time of arrival.

Therefore, the continuous playing of music until nightfall is the feature specifically highlighted in the text as a common characteristic."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini umuntfu loya emkhosini lokufanele ayihambise embili nangabe afuna kukhempa edvute nalapho kunemculo khona?","The correct answer is **A: Kuya ebusuku (Goes in the evening)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngisho nobe umculo endzaweni yawo ungaphela, kutaba netindzawo emcimbini letitochubeka tidlala umculo kute kube sebusuku.""  This translates to: ""Even if the music in their area ends, there are places at the event where music continues to play until nightfall.""

Therefore, to experience the music and atmosphere described, one needs to go in the evening. The other options are incorrect based on the text.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukuphi lapho tivakashi kufanele tigweme khona natifuna tekutijabulisa ebusuku enyakatfo ye-New Mexico?","The correct answer is **A: Kuma-Pueblos**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions that travelers should be careful about drinking too much in New Mexico because of a high number of drunk drivers, especially in smaller towns and at Pueblos.  This makes Pueblos the place tourists should avoid if they want to enjoy their nightlife safely.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Emabhala lamancane edolobheni (Small town bars):** While the text mentions small towns and drunk drivers, it doesn't explicitly say these bars are inherently dangerous. It just warns about drinking in general.
* **C: Sikhungo setitolo (Casino district):** The text *does* mention casinos, but points out that many don't serve food and are often geared towards older, wealthier clientele.  The main danger mentioned around casinos is the availability of alcohol.
* **D: Emakhasino (Casinos):**  As explained above, the danger isn't casinos themselves, but the availability of alcohol.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukuphi lapho kunematfuba lamanyenti khona ekutsi sivakashi sitfole tekutijabulisa lokwatiwa kakhulu enyakatfo ye-New Mexico?","The correct answer is **A: Ekhasino lechele ngema-awa lamabili kusuka e-Albuquerque**.

Here's why:

* The first paragraph states that Albuquerque and Santa Fe are the best places for nightlife.
* It also mentions that the best casinos are often outside of these main cities.
* Option A aligns with both of these points - it suggests casinos are available within a couple of hours of Albuquerque, which is close to the main nightlife hub.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ku-pueblo lechelile:** Pueblos are historically and culturally significant but not typically known for casinos or nightlife.
* **C: Ekhasino lesedvute neSante Fe:** The first paragraph explicitly says the best casinos aren't *in* Santa Fe and Albuquerque.
* **D: Ebhaleni lelisedolobheni lelincane:** While small towns might have casinos, the paragraph highlights that the *best* casinos are further out and that driving is common in New Mexico.



"
Tivakashi letikhatsateka kakhulu ngemali tingase tifuna kugwema luphi luhlobo lwetinatfo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ijusi yetitselo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Emajusi etitselo adulile kodvwa akahle kakhulu."" This translates to ""Fruit juices are delicious but not very good.""  Therefore, someone trying to save money would want to avoid the ""not very good"" fruit juices.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Liwayini lase-Australia (Australian wine):** The text says Australian wines ""angahle ahambe kakhulu"" - ""might not go far."" This implies they might be expensive, not that they are necessarily bad and should be avoided.
* **B: Emanti lasebhodleleni (Bottled water):** The text mentions that local spring water is good to use, but bottled water is harder to get. It doesn't state that bottled water is expensive, just difficult to obtain.
* **C: Bhiya wasendzaweni (Homemade beer):** The text describes homemade beer as tasty and beautiful, and even gives it a name (""Manta""). It doesn't imply that it's expensive.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzaweni lechazwe kulesicephu, nguliphi li-oda letinatfo lelingase lididwe ngumuntfu losevako?","The correct answer is **A: Likhofi i-short black**.

Here's why:

* The passage mentions that Australian baristas make ""espresso"" and cappuccino (with cream, no milk) and that they also make ""short black"".
* The passage states that ""Lobhiya wendzawo lodvumile yi'Number One'"" which means the local coffee is Number One. Although the options are not exactly the same, ""short black"" is a type of coffee.
*  While the passage mentions Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, it doesn't specifically link it to a specific type of drink a person might order. 
* The description of ""Manta"" (the other coffee) is quite vague and doesn't directly correspond to any of the options.

Therefore, ""short black"" is the most logical answer based on the information provided.
"
"Njengobe satsatsa emakhulu lamatsatfu eminyaka, sikhatsi sekubusa kwemakoloni sacalwa nguliphi licembu?","The correct answer is **D: I- Spaniards**.

The passage states: ""Ngelikhulu lesi-16 iParaguay, lebeyibitwa ngalokusemtsetfweni ngekutsi """"Sifundza Lesikhulu Sase-Indies"""", yaba khona ngenca yekuhlangana kwebancobi beseSpain nelicembu lalabo bemdzabu..."" This directly indicates that the Spanish colonized Paraguay.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu,nguyiphi indlela lencono yekwenta umuntfu waseParis kutsi akhululeke kuwe?","The correct answer is **C: Bani nenhlonipho (Be respectful)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...indlela lekahle kakhulu yekwati iParis kutsi utiphatse kahle, wente tintfo njengemuntfu lokutsiwa ngaye """"bien élevé"""" (ukhuliswe kahle)."" This translates to ""...the best way to get along in Paris is to behave well, to act like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-bred).""  ""Well-bred"" implies respectfulness.

The passage also mentions that Parisians value respect and that a lack of it will make things difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yetama kulingisa indlela yekwenta tintfo yebantfu baseParis (Try to imitate how Parisians do things):**  While imitation *might* help, the text emphasizes *respectful* behavior, not just mimicking actions.
*   **B: Veta kutetsemba (Be deceitful):** This is the opposite of what the text suggests.
*   **D: Bonisa kukhululeka lokukhulu (Show great ease):** While appearing confident can be helpful, the text prioritizes respect over ease.



Therefore, being respectful is the core recommendation from the passage."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kulolu lokulandzelako lokungatsatfwa njengembono longashintji mayelana nebantfu baseParis?","The correct answer is **A: Kutikhukhumeta (To be arrogant/conceited)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Parisians are often perceived as lacking respect and being haughty (""kungabi nanhlonipho nekuhaha""). The phrase ""bien élevé"" (well-bred) implies a certain level of sophistication and proper behavior, but the passage suggests that many Parisians don't uphold this standard and instead come across as arrogant.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **B: Kuba luhlata (To be rude/ill-mannered):** While rudeness might be *part* of the perceived arrogance, the core issue highlighted is more about a sense of superiority.
* **C: Kutsandza kudlala (To be playful/joking):**  The passage doesn't suggest playfulness. It focuses on a lack of respect.
* **D: Kwenta tintfo ngalokungalindzelekile (To do things unexpectedly):**  Unexpected actions don't necessarily equate to arrogance.

Therefore, **kutikhukhumeta (being arrogant/conceited)** best captures the unchanging view presented in the passage about Parisians.



"
Iyini inzuzo yeLizinga Lekucala Etitimeleni taseCape Town?,"The correct answer is **C: Lishiphile kunelithikithi leLizinga Lesitsatfu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""iMetroPlus ihlalisekile futsi ayikagcwali kodvwa iyabita kancane, noma ingabiti kundlula emathikithi e-metro leyetayelwe eYurophu."" This translates to ""MetroPlus is comfortable and not crowded but it can be a little noisy, or it might be quieter than a ticket on a European metro.""  This implies that MetroPlus offers a more comfortable experience compared to the Third Class (Metro) option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Litilogo lingembili kwesitimela** - This is true but doesn't explain the *benefit* of the First Class.
* **B: Kute bantfu labanyenti kakhulu** - The passage states the opposite - MetroPlus is *not* crowded.
* **D: Liyimali lefanako neyelithikitsi leSitimela** - The passage doesn't mention the price of the First Class ticket.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini sitimela sebagibeli eCape Town lesinayo?","The correct answer is **D: Kokubili ematilogo elizinga Lekucala neLesitsatfu.**

Here's why:

The text clearly states that there are two types of trains in Cape Town:

*   **MetroPlus (First Class)**
*   **Metro (Third Class)**

Therefore, the answer must include both First Class and Third Class.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Litilogo le-Metro lelingakagcwali kakhulu:** While MetroPlus is not full, this doesn't describe *both* train types.
*   **B: Imali lefanako yemathikithi yawo womabili emazinga:** The text doesn't mention ticket prices.
*   **C: Kunemazinga lamatsatfu langafani:** While there are different classes, the text doesn't indicate there are other classes besides First and Third.

"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako tinambutane lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi tikwente?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwandzisa ligciwane (Increases the risk of infection)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes situations where animals (specifically, unusual animals in a home) cause problems like bites, scratches, and potential disease transmission.  The phrase ""tifo letitsatselwano ngekwato, noma tilwane letiyingoti letingalimata noma tibulale bantfu ngelulaka"" explicitly mentions diseases spread from animals. Therefore, the most logical consequence is an increased risk of infection.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Kubangela kucubuka (Causes itching):** While animal bites and scratches *can* cause itching, it's not the primary or most serious consequence described in the passage.
*   **B: Kubangela ema-aleji (Causes allergies):** Allergic reactions are possible, but the passage focuses more on the direct danger of disease transmission.
*   **D: Kubangela kulimala lokunemandla (Causes serious injury):** While animals can cause injury, the passage focuses more on the potential for disease. While serious injuries can happen, disease is a more central concern based on the text.



"
Atsengwa kuphi emakhadi elucingo lakhokhelwa kusengaphambili?,"The answer is **D: Etincingweni letikhokhelwako (Payphones)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lamanye ngalokukhetsekile akunikeita emanani laphasi ekushaya nawushayela emave latsite kuphela. Letinsita tivamise kufinyeleleka ngekushayela inombolo lengabhadalelwa longayishayela ngetincingo letinyenti ngaphandle kwekubhadala.""

This means payphone cards are specifically for making calls from payphones and are pre-paid.
"
Atfolakala kanjani emanani lancono ekushaya tincingo ngalamanye emakhadi ?,"The correct answer is **C: Etitolo letincane (In small print)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ngisho noma lamanyenti emakhadi kukahle kushaya ngawo lucingo noma ngukuphi, lamanye ngalokukhetsekile ngalokukhetsekile akuniketa emanani laphasi ekushaya nawushayela emave latsite kuphela."" This means some cards *only* offer rewards when used for calls to shortcodes.

Then, it mentions: ""Letinsita tivamise kufinyeleleka ngekushayela inombolo lengabhadalelwa longayishayela ngetincingo letinyenti ngaphandle kwekubhadala."" This implies that the details of the shortcode numbers (where the rewards are found) are often hidden in the small print.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate based on the text provided.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi kuletihlahla letilandzelako lesingakavami e-Plitvice Lakes national park?","The correct answer is **C: I-fir**.

The text explicitly states: ""futsi kukhona nenhlanganisela yetitjalo te-Alphani netaseMediterranean. Inetitjalo letinyenti letiphawulekako emiphakatsini, ngenca yekwehluka hluka kwelizinga lekushisa nekubandza, imihlabatsi yehlukile ngenca yemaleveli ekuphakama.

And ""...the prominent plants in the middle are fir trees...""

Therefore, fir trees are mentioned as a prominent plant species in the Plitvice Lakes National Park.
"
Ngutiphi kuletilwane letingakavami letitfolakalako e-Plitvice Lakes national park?,"The correct answer is **D: I-capercaillie**.

The text mentions ""capercaillie"" (saHHukulu) as one of the birds found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. The other options are not mentioned in the provided text.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, emakhodi etifundza asita kuphi?","The correct answer is **B: Kulawula imakethe**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Inhloso lekungiyo kunika tinkampani kulawula timaketse tato; konkhe kumayelana nekushintjana ngemali.""  This translates to ""The purpose is to give companies control over the market; it's all about money.""  Therefore, the core reason for the codes exists to control the market.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kukopa emadiskhi (Copying disks):**  While the codes relate to copying disks, the purpose isn't *just* about copying.
* **C: Kuvikela bugebengu (Protecting piracy):** The passage explicitly states the codes *enable* piracy (by making it difficult to detect).  They don't protect against it.
* **D: Kuvikela kukopisha lokungekho emtsetfweni (Protecting illegal copying):** Similar to C, the codes *facilitate* illegal copying, they don't protect against it.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungemanga mayelana nemakhodi esifundza futsi lasakatwa tinkapani tetindzaba?","The correct answer is **A: Ayadzingeka kuze ulawule imakhethe lenkhulu (It's likely to control the market)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Inhloso lekungiyo kunika tinkampani kulawula timaketse tato; konkhe kumayelana nekushintjana ngemali.""  This translates to: ""The purpose is to give companies control over the market; it's all about money.""  Therefore, the primary goal is market control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Asita ekuvikeleni kukopisha lokungekho emtsetfweni (It's not to protect against piracy):** The passage says the code *doesn't* prevent illegal copying; it actually makes it easier to copy.
* **C: Alusito ekwakheni imali (It's not to make money):**  The passage clearly states that the whole thing is *about* money (""kushintjana ngemali"").
* **D: Akavamisile kuvikela bugebengu (It's not usually to protect against piracy):** As mentioned in B, the passage indicates piracy isn't the intention.



"
"Nawufika eveni lakini, nguyiphi inchubo ngalokuvamile lengakahleleki?","The correct answer is **D: Kulawula kuphuma nekungena kwetintfo**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the *purpose* of security checks at borders.** The passage states that while inconvenient, border control is necessary. 
* **Option D directly addresses the core function of border control: regulating the flow of people (entry and exit).**  The passage implies this regulation is essential for managing potential threats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuhlolwa kwalabangenako (Checking of the undesirable):** While checking undesirable individuals is *part* of border control, it's not the overall *purpose*. The checks are more comprehensive than just looking for ""undesirables.""
* **B: Kubika tintfo (Reporting things):** Reporting is a consequence of finding something, not the primary goal of the checks themselves.
* **C: Silinganiso lesisemtsetfweni setintfo (Standard of the legal framework of things):** While border control operates within a legal framework, the checks themselves aren't primarily about maintaining legal standards; they're about managing movement.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokufanele ukwati ngembi kwekufika eveni lakini?,"The correct answer is **C: Nangabe kutawuba nalabalawula kuphuma nekungena kwetintfo.**

Here's why:

The question asks what you need to be aware of when arriving at a checkpoint.  Option C directly addresses security procedures - who is controlling the flow of people and goods. Knowing who is responsible for checking entry and exit is crucial for compliance and reporting.

Let's look at why the other options are less relevant:

* **A: Nakutawuba nendzawo yekuhlola labangenako** (There might be a checkpoint with no people): While possible, this doesn't relate to what *you* need to be aware of.
* **B: Nawutawudzinga kutsi ubika tintfo letingetulu kwesilinganiso lesisemtsetfweni** (You will need to report things above a certain standard of the law): Reporting thresholds are important, but the *first* thing to be aware of at a checkpoint is *who* is enforcing the laws.
* **D: Nangabe lokutsite lokuphetse kungakavumeleki** (If the license plate is invalid): This is something you'd be informed of *if* it was an issue, but the primary awareness should be about the checkpoint process itself.



Therefore, understanding *who* is in charge of controlling entry/exit is the most fundamental and important thing to be aware of when arriving at a checkpoint.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, bunyenti bani lobenta kutsi bantfu labacancako bahlale batfola tindlela letinsha eSigodzingi SaseCochamó?","The correct answer is **C: Sicongo**.

The sentence states: ""Bantfu labacanca tintsaba labavela emhlabeni wonkhe bahlale batfola tindlela letinsha tekuyofika etulu."" This translates to: ""Mountain climbers from all over the world have always found various ways to reach the summit."" The word ""tulu"" refers to the **summit** or **peak** of the mountain, which is the ""sicongo"" (peak/summit).
"
"Ngalokusekelwe ekwatisweni lokukulesicephu, ngubani lohlanganisa tindzawo letiwelwa kakhulu eNingizimu Yenkhaba Yemhlaba?","The correct answer is **A: I-SkyTeam**.

The passage explicitly states: ""i-alliance yetindza lehlanganisa tonkhe totintsatfu tindzawo tekwewela lwandle ku Ningizimu Hemisphere (neSkyTeam ayihlanganisi ngisho yinye yaletindzawo tekwewela).""  This translates to: ""the airline alliance includes all the ocean destinations in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not include even one of these destinations).""
"
Ngutiphi tindiza letiwela kancane eNingizimu Yenkhaba Yemhlaba?,"The correct answer is **C: LATAM Oneworld**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""iStar Alliance ihlanganisa konkhe ngaphandle kwemphumalanga Ningizimu Pacific kusukela eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti, lokuyindiza i-ATAM Oneworld."" This directly links LATAM Oneworld to flights in the South Pacific.
* While the passage mentions the South Pacific, it's not a specific airline alliance.
* SkyTeam is excluded from the South Hemisphere's major beach destinations.
* Star Alliance covers a large area, but the question asks for airlines that specifically serve the South Pacific.



"
Nguyiphi inhlangano yekuvakasha lephumelele i-Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Go Running Tours**.

The text states: ""I-Go Running Tours letsetse sikhundla seGlobal Running Tours..."" This directly identifies Go Running Tours as the organization mentioned as successful. While the other options are mentioned as part of Go Running Tours' expansion, the question asks for the *successful organization*.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, i-Go Running Tours isita ekuhlanganiseni tinhlangano letingakhi tekugijima ube ubuka tindzawo?","The correct answer is **B: 200**.

The passage states: ""Emhlabeni wonkhe, kunetinhlangano leticishe tibe ngu-200 tekuhambisa bantfu babuke tindzawo."" This translates to: ""Worldwide, there are approximately 200 organizations that organize trips for people to see places.""  The passage then goes on to describe Go Running Tours as one of these organizations.
"
Yini lokufanele sivakashi siyente nasinelitsemba lekubona kahle lihlosi?,"The correct answer is **B: Hamba ehlatsini**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuhamba ubona tilwane (futsi lokubitwa """"ngekuhamba emahlatsini"""", """"luhambo ubona tilwane"""", noma uhamba """"ngetinyawo"""")) kufaka ekhatsi kukhwela intsaba, lelingaba lwema-awa lambalwa noma emalanga lambalwa.""

This directly translates to: ""Going to see animals (also called ""walking safaris"", ""wildlife walks"", or walking ""on foot"") sometimes involves trekking with a walking stick, which can last for several hours or even days.""

Therefore, walking safaris (hamba ehlatsini) are a way to increase your chances of seeing wildlife. The other options are less directly supported by the passage.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesilwane sivakashi lokungenteka sisibone nasisahamba ngemoti?","The correct answer is **B: Tindlulamitsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Letinye tilwane, letifaka ekhatsi tindlovu netindlulamitsi, titsandza kusondzela etimotweni futsi loko kungasibangela kutsi sitibone kahle.""  This translates to: ""Other animals, including elephants and **hippopotamuses**, like to get close to cars and this can make us see them well.""

Therefore, hippos are specifically mentioned as animals visitors can often see while traveling by car.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengehlisa imali yeluhambo?","The correct answer is **D: Kutfola licembu lebantfu labasitfupha nome ngetulu (Getting a share of the cost with a group of people or more).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kuvakashi tihlanganiswa ndzawonye kugcwalisa letimoto... bantfu bakhohlise labanye babente bakholelwe kutsi kufanele babhadale imali lenyenti."" (Travelers are combined to fill a car... people deceive others into believing they should pay more money). This indicates that splitting the costs with a larger group *reduces* the individual cost.

Options A, B, and C are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutihambela wena (Traveling alone):** The passage actually suggests traveling with others to reduce costs.
*   **B: Kutfola licembu lalabane (Getting a share of a quad bike):** This is a specific scenario mentioned, but the overall point is about sharing costs with a larger group, not just quad bikes.
*   **C: Kuhamba nalomunye umuntfu (Traveling with one other person):** While better than traveling alone, the passage advocates for even more people to further reduce the cost.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani longaba nenhlanhla yekutfola imali yekuvakasha lencono?","The correct answer is **A: Tivakashi letikulungle kudvonsa timoti (Tourists who share taxis)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that sharing taxis is a common practice to reduce travel costs.** It specifically states that people often combine trips to fill vehicles, making the cost per person lower.
* **Option A directly reflects this practice.** Tourists who share taxis are the ones most likely to benefit from the reduced cost of transportation.
* **The other options are less directly linked to the passage's main point:**
    * **B: Licembu lalabatsatfu (Groups of friends):** While groups might share costs, it's not explicitly stated as the primary way to get cheaper travel.
    * **C: Bangani labahamba ndzawonye (Travel companions):** Same reasoning as B.
    * **D: Licembu lalabasihlanu (Groups of five):** There's no specific mention of groups of five having a special advantage.

Therefore, **tourists who share taxis** are the ones who are most likely to get the best deal on travel expenses based on the information provided.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyafaka sandla ekutsi i-San Francisco icashelwe emhlabeni wonkhe?","The correct answer is **A: Kuba khona njalo etinhlotjeni letehlukehlukene temaciko netindzaba**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Kuvetwa lokuvamile kwemiculo, emafilimu, tincwadzi kanye nemasiko lavamile kusite ekwenteni lelidolobha latiwe emhlabeni wonkhole."" (The prevalence of art, films, literature, and popular customs is what has made the city famous worldwide.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tikhungo temhlangano letisezingeni lelisetulu:** While San Francisco *does* have upscale convention centers, the text doesn't highlight them as the primary reason for its global fame.
* **C: Kuhlukahluka kwetemnotfo:**  While cultural diversity *contributes* to San Francisco's fame, the text emphasizes the *prevalence* of culture in art, film, etc., rather than just the diversity itself.
* **D: Indzawo yekudla yase-Asia leta kahle:**  The text mentions Asian influences, but doesn't position it as *the* best Asian dining destination as the core reason for global recognition.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana ne-San Francisco?","The correct answer is **A: Ifakwe kakhulu kumamuvi nasetincwadzini**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kuvetwa lokuvamile kwemiculo, emafilimu, tincwadzi nemasiko lavamile kusite ekwenteni lelidolobha latiwe emhlabeni wonkhe.""  This directly supports the idea that San Francisco is frequently featured in movies and literature.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate based on the passage:

* **B: Kunyenti kakhulu kudla kwase-Asia:** While the passage mentions the presence of Asian cultures and cuisine, it doesn't say it's *extremely* common. It just states that Asian cultures are prominent.
* **C: Manyenti emahhotela netindzawo temihlangano:** The passage mentions luxurious hotels and convention centers, but doesn't emphasize that they are *very* luxurious. It says San Francisco *has* them.
* **D: Umnotfo usekelwe tekuvakasha ngalokuphelele:** The passage says the economy is supported by tourism, but doesn't claim it's *entirely* dependent on it. It also mentions other sectors like finance.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesivakashi lokute ematfuba ekutsi luzuze ngekusebentisa inkapani yekuvakasha?","The correct answer is **D: Sivakashi lesinconota kubhuka nakunendali (Travelers who book and have a tour guide)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights that tour operators can assist with:

*   **Booking hotels:** They often get discounts.
*   **Arranging transportation:** Flights, transfers, etc.
*   **Planning itineraries:** Including activities and sights.
*   **Visa assistance:** Helping with the visa application process.
*   **Providing a guide:** This is a core element of a tour.

Options A, B, and C don't encompass the full range of services described in the passage.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengenzuzo yekubhuka usebentisa inkapani yekuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **C: Emaphakheji lafaka konkhe (All-inclusive packages)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions that travel agencies often arrange things like breakfast, transportation, and even flights and hotels. 
* **All-inclusive packages** are a common offering from travel agencies – they bundle flights, accommodation, and often meals and activities into one price. This fits perfectly with the description in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Timphepha tekuhamba letisheshisiwe (Expedited travel documents):** While travel agencies *can* help with visas and other documents, the passage doesn't emphasize expedited documents as a primary benefit.
* **B: Emadili lashisako (Discounted rates):** The passage mentions travel agencies *sometimes* get hotel discounts, but it doesn't focus on discounted rates in general.
* **D: Kubamba indzawo (Securing a spot):** While a travel agent can help secure bookings, it's not the central benefit described.

Therefore, **C: Emaphakheji lafaka konkhe** is the best fit based on the information presented in the text.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini tinhlelo tekuhumusha lokubhaliwe letingakhoni kuyenta?","The correct answer is **D: Kuhumusha kahle ngaso sonkhe sikhatsi** (Translate accurately at all times).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ngakuvele kungenteka lokuhunyushiwe kungabi ngiko."" ( ...it is possible that the translation is inaccurate.) This directly implies that translation apps are *not* always accurate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuhumusha timphawu ngetilwini tekuhamba** (Translate signs using a phone camera): The text explicitly mentions this capability as something other translation apps *can* do.
* **B: Kuhumusha ticephu temibhalo** (Translate written text): The text states that other apps *can* translate written text.
* **C: Kuhumusha emavi lasetintfweni usebentisa lucingo lwesimanje** (Translate speech using a smartphone): The text mentions this feature as something other translation apps *can* do.



"
Yini levumela kutsi kuhunyushwe nawungekho ku-inthanethi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kudawuniloda kwatiswa kwelulwimi**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""levumela kuhumusha ngaphandle kwe-intanethi emva kwekutsi udawunilode lemininigwane yalolulimi.""  This directly translates to ""allows to translate offline after downloading the language pack.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tinhlelo tekuhumusha letitfutfukisiwe (The evolved translation systems):** While evolved systems contribute to offline translation capabilities, the download of the language pack is the *direct* mechanism enabling it.
*   **B: Tincingo tesimanje (Modern devices):** Modern devices are necessary to *run* the app, but they don't *enable* offline translation.
*   **D: Tinhlelo letitfolakala ngaphansi kwencenye yekuhumusha (Systems available under a part of the translation):** This is not a clear or accurate description of how offline translation works.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungabangeli kuwa kwelichwa entsabeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Lichwa lelinamatsele** (The sticky water).

Here's why:

The passage states the problem is with the ""lichwa lelinamatsele"" (sticky water) that accumulates and causes problems. The question asks what *could* cause the water to flood. The passage lists several things that *do* cause flooding (sun, heavy rain, environmental disasters), but the core issue is the sticky water itself.  Therefore, the sticky water is the underlying cause that can lead to flooding.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokwenhla njengengelichwa leliwa entsabeni?","The correct answer is **A: Lichwa lelinamatsele lelingabangelwanga (The unmanageable/uncontrollable smoke)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes smoke that is:

* **Unmanageable:** It's hard to control and keeps spreading.
* **Unpredictable:** It's caused by different factors like heat, rain, and natural disasters.
* **Dangerous:**  It poses a threat to people.

Option A, ""Lichwa lelinamatsele lelingabangelwanga"" best captures this sense of uncontrollable and unpredictable danger, making it the most fitting continuation of the problem described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Tindzawo letehlelako letite lichwa (The places that are more prone to smoke):** While places can be more susceptible, the core issue isn't just location; it's the *unmanageable nature of the smoke itself*.
* **C: Lichwa lelinyenti etindzaweni letehlelako (The scattered smoke in the places that are more prone):** This describes the smoke's distribution, not the fundamental problem of its uncontrollable nature.
* **D: Lichwa lelisala lingatsintfwanga bantfu (The remaining smoke that cannot affect people):**  This contradicts the passage's statement that the smoke is a threat to people.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, khari usekelwe kutiphi titsako?","The correct answer is **B: Emakhambi netinongo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Khari kudla lokuhlanganisa emakhambi netinongo, kanye nenyama noma tibhidvo."" which translates to ""Khari is a dish that combines vegetables and lentils, along with meat or dumplings.""

While yogurt and coconut milk *can* be used in khari in certain regions, the text doesn't say they are *fundamental* to its base. The core ingredients are vegetables and lentils.
"
"Kuletinye tifundza, lubisi lwekhokhonathi ngaletinye tikhatsi lusetjentiswa esikhundleni sasiphi sitsako kukhari?","The correct answer is **C: Iyogathi**.

The text states: ""ENingizimu yeNdiya nakuletinye tifundza letiselugwini lalelivekati, lubisi lwekhokhonathi livame kusetjentiswa kukhari; **Iyogathi ivame kusetjentiswa kukhari**...""

Therefore, coconut milk is used as a substitute for yogurt in some regions.
"
Kungani kudzingeka kutsi ujike utungelete tintsaba tase-Transantarctic kuze ufike etsafeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Siteshi i-McMurdo sivamise kuvalwa.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the South Pole Traverse is a long journey across the Transantarctic Mountains. It also mentions that the journey *requires* traversing the mountains to reach the Pole. The reason given for this requirement is that McMurdo Station (the starting point) is often closed, making direct access to the Pole impossible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lichwa lelingcingcekile liyingoti** (The geological material is gold): The passage doesn't mention anything about gold.
* **C: Tigulumbha letikhetsekile atisheshi** (The specially equipped planes are fast): While the planes are equipped, the passage emphasizes the difficulty of the journey and the need for careful planning, not speed.
* **D: Kumelula kunekuhamba ngase-Ross Sea** (It's easier to travel through the Ross Sea): The passage implies that traversing the Transantarctic Mountains is *necessary*, not easier than the Ross Sea.

Therefore, the only reason supported by the text is that **McMurdo Station is often closed**, requiring the Traverse to go through the Transantarctic Mountains."
"E-South Pole Traverse, yini lephawulwe ngemafulegi?","The correct answer is **C: Timfa letigcwele lichwa**.

The text states: ""Lichwa laso lihlanganisa kuchekeka lokugcwaliswe ngemafulegi."" This translates to ""Its cargo includes checked supplies.""  The supplies are the things marked with flags. The text goes on to specify what those supplies *are* (fuel, food, etc.), but the core point is that the *supplies* are marked with flags.
"
Yini lengashiwongo kulesicephu njengentfo tivakashi lokufanele tiyai nativakashela iNingizimu Afrikha?,"The correct answer is **A: Kunetimvuneko letingefani tema-visa etiveni letehlukehlukene (There are different visa requirements for different nationalities)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that visa requirements and costs vary depending on the traveler's nationality. This is a key piece of information a visitor needs to know.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuvakasha ngemoti kuyindlela lekahle yekuvakashela tindzawo letikhashane nemgwaco lohanjwa njalo (Traveling by car is a good way to visit remote and off-road areas)**: The passage *does* say this is a good way to visit remote areas, but it's not the *missing* information. It's already included.
*   **C: Cishe onkhe emave lakhelene neNingizimu Afrikha atintile (Almost all borders of South Africa are touched)**: The passage states that South Africa's borders aren't all equally accessible by car.  So, this is incorrect.
*   **D: Kunconywa i-4x4 nawuhamba ngemoti (A 4x4 is recommended when traveling by car)**: This is mentioned in the passage.  It's not missing information.

Therefore, the differing visa requirements are the crucial detail that's highlighted but not fully elaborated upon, making option A the best answer."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengatsatfwa njengeseluleko lesibi etivakashini letifuna kuvakasha eNingizimu Afrikha ngemoti?","The correct answer is **B: Nanome kunconywa i-4x4, tindzawo letinyenti kuyafikeka kuto ngemoti levamile.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that a 4x4 is *highly* recommended for accessing many areas in South Africa.** It mentions that 4x4 vehicles are necessary for navigating certain terrains. 
* Option B directly contradicts this recommendation, suggesting a regular car is sufficient for all areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tintfo letitsite tetimo letiphutfumako emotini tingase tifunwe ngumtsetfo** - The passage mentions this, so it's not a bad tip.
* **C: Kuhamba ngemoti kuhle kakhulu kulabo labafuna kuphuma etindleleni letivamile** - The passage agrees that driving is a good way to explore off-the-beaten path.
* **D: Akusiwo onkhe emave lakhelene neNingizimu Afrikha lokuyintfo lenhle kuwavakashela** - The passage contradicts this by saying South Africa has beautiful areas to visit.



Therefore, Option B is the only statement presented in the passage that would be considered *bad* advice for someone planning a South Africa road trip.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengengoti lengase ibe khona nawushiya tikhwama takho tingakagadvwa?,"The best answer is **D: Tiphatsimandla tingase ticabange kutsi tinebhomu (Authorities might think it has a bomb)**.

Here's why:

* The passage repeatedly emphasizes the danger of leaving unattended bags, especially in public places. It mentions the potential for the bag to be used in bombings and the severe legal consequences.
* Option D directly addresses the most likely consequence of authorities perceiving a bag as potentially containing a bomb – heightened suspicion and potential for dangerous actions.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Tingase tebiwe (It might be stolen):** While theft is a possibility, the passage focuses on the *serious security risk* associated with unattended bags.
* **B: Ungatfwala tidzakamiva kodvwa ungati (You might take your belongings but forget):** This describes the *reason* for the risk, not a consequence.
* **C: Tingase tiphambaniswe netalomunye umuntfu (It might be compared to someone else):** This is a very indirect and unlikely consequence.

Therefore, **D** is the most logical and directly related consequence the passage implies.



"
Yini lengashiwongo kulesicephu ngekutfwala tidzakamiva?,"The correct answer is **A: Kulamanye emave, labephula umtsetfo kwekucala bgase bagwetjwe intsambo**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that in some areas, those caught possessing weapons face severe consequences, including up to 10 years in prison or even death.**  Option A directly reflects this severe consequence – being sentenced to a prison term.
* **Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the passage:**
    * **B:** While caution is advised, the passage doesn't explicitly state that one *must* be extra careful in these areas.
    * **C:** The passage says weapons *can* be used by armed individuals, but it doesn't state they *can* be used without warning.
    * **D:** The passage mentions authorities might confiscate weapons, but it doesn't mention that other individuals (like thieves) might do so.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate statement that is supported directly by the passage.



"
Nguyiphi inhlobo yesinatfo lengakashiwo njengentfo longetama kuyenta ekhaya ngesikhatsi uhleli?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhiya (Beer)**.

Here's why:

The text states that coffee is consumed in the morning and beer is consumed at night. It also mentions that the person often has time to relax and use their free time to prepare something special.  The text then suggests juice or smoothies as a way to cope with feeling overwhelmed.  Since beer is specifically mentioned as a nighttime drink, and the question asks what *isn't* mentioned as something the person enjoys at home while relaxing, beer is the most likely answer. The text implies they wouldn't enjoy beer as much as coffee in the morning.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokufanele ukuvakashela nangabe lidolobha lakho latiwa ngelisiko lalo lekunatsa?,"The correct answer is **B: Titolo tejusi nome smoothie**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that if you're feeling stressed in the morning and having trouble focusing, you should ""take advantage of the opportunity to make juice or blend smoothies.""  This directly points to juice and smoothie places as a good option.

The other options are less relevant:

*   **A: Titolo telikhofi ngephandle kwendzawo lokuyo:** While coffee is mentioned, the text focuses more on a stress-reducing beverage.
*   **C: Titolo tetjwala longavamisile kuya kuto:**  This is completely unrelated to the text's focus on stress relief and healthy options.
*   **D: Titolo tekudlela letenta litiya i-chamomile:** Chamomile tea is mentioned as a relaxing option in the text, but the text leans more towards juice or smoothies as a direct remedy.



"
Itfolakala kuphi imifanekiso yematuba lebatiwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ebaleni elisontfo**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Lesontfweni kulamathuna lalabaleni kubekwe ematuba lamahle lakhiwe nge mabula."" This translates to ""On the boat, there are benches with beautiful nests built with wood.""

Therefore, the images of the nests are found on the boat.
"
Nguluphi luhlobo lwe-visa lolungase ludzinge kutsi umuntfu aletse bufakazi bekuba nemali leyenele yekumsekela?,"The correct answer is **D: I-visa yekufundza (Student Visa)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Emaveni lamanyenti, utawudzinga kutsi ube nencwadzi lebuya kulesikolwa lotawufunda kuso, futsi ube nebufakazi bekutsi utawukhona kutisekela lokungenani kulomnyaka wekucala wetifundvo takho.""  This refers to a student visa, which requires proof of financial support to cover tuition and living expenses.  Business and tourist visas typically don't require this level of financial documentation.
"
Ngubani lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi adzinge i-visa lenesikhatsi leseluliwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Umfundzi lovela kulelinye live**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emaveni lamanyenti, utawudzinga kutsi ube nencwadzi lebuya kulesikolwa lotawufunda kuso, futsi ube nebufakazi bekutsi utawukhona kutisekela lokungenani kulomnyaka wekucala wetifundvo takho.""  This directly refers to students coming from other locations who need proof of enrollment and financial support.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sivakashi lesifika njalo:** The passage implies that people who visit frequently might not always need a visa, but it doesn't specifically point to them needing a visa *and* having a limited time.
* **B: Sivakashi lesingumakadzebona:** The passage doesn't mention healthcare workers specifically needing a visa and limited time.
* **D: Sivakashi lesihamba ngetemabhizinisi:** While business travelers often need visas, the passage focuses on the specific requirements for students.



"
Kunini lapho kufanele ube nendzaba khona netimbuzulwane?,"The correct answer is **C: Etindzaweni temahlatsi lanemvula** (In rainy areas).

Here's why:

The question states that snakes are frequently encountered when driving through rainy areas.  Options A, B, and D don't directly reflect the information given in the question.  The problem is specifically linked to rainy environments.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokufanele ungayenti kuze ugweme timbuzulwane nawushayela etindzaweni temahlatsi lanemvula?","The correct answer is **A: Kushiya tivalo temoti tivulekile sikhatsi lesidze** (Leaving the car window open at that time).

The question describes a common situation where mosquitoes enter the car when windows are open during rainy weather. Therefore, avoiding leaving the windows open is the best way to prevent mosquito bites.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kushayela ehlobo** (Drive in circles): This wouldn't help prevent mosquitoes.
* **C: Kushayela etindzaweni letishisako** (Drive in hot places):  While mosquitoes thrive in warm climates, simply driving in a hot place doesn't necessarily prevent them from entering the car.
* **D: Kushiya imoti inganamuntfu nawusahayikha** (Leave the car empty and unoccupied):  Whether the car is occupied or not, if the windows are open, mosquitoes can still enter.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langesilo liciniso mayelana ne-Sundarbans?","The correct answer is **C: Yindzawo lenkhulu emhlabeni yemahlatsi e-mangrove**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""I-Sundarbans indzawo lenkhulu emhlabeni lenesitjalo i-mangrove lesiselusebeni lwelwandle emhlabeni...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inalamanye emahlatsi lamakhulu lambalwa lasekasele:** The passage mentions *one* research project in India, not multiple.
* **B: Incenye yendzawo yayo igcwele emachaphoti:** The passage says ""ikota yaleyo ndzawo ivalwe ngemanti/emachaphoti"" which means *part* is flooded, not the entire area.
* **D: Ilikhaya letinyamatane letinemabalabala kwendlula ema-Bengal tiger:** While the passage mentions Bengal tigers, it doesn't state that the Sundarbans *exclusively* houses them. It mentions a significant tiger population (400+), but doesn't claim it's the only place tigers live.



"
Nguyiphi incenye yelihlatsi lesekhatsi kwendzawo yaseNdiya?,"The correct answer is **B: I-The wildlife sanctuary**.

The text states: ""Incenye yelihlatsi lelisemhlabeni waseNdiya ibitwa ngekutsi yiPaki Yesive yaseSundarbans."" This translates to ""A part of the global study in India is called the Sundarbans Wildlife Sanctuary.""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lokunematfuba lamakhulu ekutsi alucondze lokungenani kancane lulwimi lwesiNgisi?","The correct answer is **A: Bantfu labakhuluma lokungenani letinye tilwimi letimbili (People who speak at least two other languages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people from different backgrounds, including those from Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, and Sydney, can all come together and communicate in Toronto, even though they speak different languages. This implies that a shared understanding or ability to bridge language gaps exists.  The passage also mentions that people who speak English well are common, but some may have incomplete proficiency, especially newcomers.

Therefore, people who already speak multiple languages are more likely to be able to pick up *some* English, even if it's not perfect, because they have experience learning new languages and understanding different linguistic structures.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Bantfu labancane ngeminyaka (Young people):** While children are generally good at language acquisition, the passage doesn't specifically link youth to English proficiency.
* **C: Bantfu labaya eToronto (People who go to Toronto):**  Being in Toronto doesn't automatically guarantee English proficiency. It's a melting pot, and many people there speak various languages.
* **D: Bantfu lasebakhulile ngeminyaka (Older people):** Older people can learn languages, but the passage doesn't emphasize age as a determining factor for English proficiency in this context.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokungaba matima kuyibita?","The correct answer is **C: Emagama labhaliwe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mavi labhaliwe ngalokuvamile kulula kuwacondza kunemavi lashiwo ngemlomo."" (Written words are usually easier to understand than spoken words.)

The entire passage revolves around the idea that language is diverse and complex, with different dialects, written forms, and influences.  The key point being made is the relative ease of understanding **written language**.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi simo lesingalungela sivakashi lesihlela kutsatsa ibhasi lesuka esiteshini lesisekhatsi nesifundza?","The correct answer is **A: Lesivakashi siya e-Jakar futsi sesivele silitsengile lithikithi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Buses from the eastern areas (including Jakar/Bumthang) fill up quickly, especially between 6:30 and 7:30. It's best to buy tickets in advance.
* **Option A reflects this advice:** It suggests going to Jakar and buying a ticket beforehand, avoiding the potential for the bus to be full.
* **Options B, C, and D are problematic:**
    * **B:**  Suggests waiting until 7:00, which is within the peak time when buses are likely to be full.
    * **C:** Suggests going to Paro at 11:00, which isn't mentioned in relation to bus availability.
    * **D:** Suggests arriving at the station before 6:20, which is *during* the peak time of bus filling up.



"
Nguliph licebiso lelihle esivakashini lesifuna kuya emphumalanga sisuka esiteshini lesisesifundzeni lesisekhatsi?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsenga lithikithi kusengaphambili**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ngoba emabhasi lachumanisa tifundza avamise kugcwala kuyaye kube kahle kutsi **lithikithi ulitsenge kusasele emalanga lingakafiki lilanga lakho lekuhamba**."" (Because the buses are usually full, it's better to buy tickets in advance.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emabhasi asuka ngemuva kwa-8:30:** The text says buses run from 6:30 to 7:30 in the morning, and then are usually full. This option doesn't address the problem of buses being full.
* **C: Emabhasi lamanyenti ahlale esuka lilanga lonkhe:** The text says Japanese Coaster Buses are common but not necessarily always running all day.
* **D: Itekisi lehlanganyelwako ingase ibe yindlela lehlakaniphile yekuhamba:** While the text mentions taxis as an option, the primary concern is the buses being full.  Buying a ticket in advance is a direct solution to this problem.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungayichazi kahle i-Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ayifinyeleleki ngendiza**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nga-1990, yabalelwa njengalenye yetindzawo temafa temhlaba letisengotini..."" This implies accessibility and recognition, not inaccessibility. The passage later mentions it being a popular tourist destination.
* **The passage mentions:**  ""lidolobha leliphuyile,"" indicating it's not a hidden place.
* **The passage emphasizes:** its historical and cultural significance, attracting visitors.
* **The passage states:** ""...linemoya wesi-Arab kundlula we-Africa,"" confirming a significant Arab influence.

Therefore, option C is the statement that *doesn't* align with the information provided in the text. The text indicates that it is accessible.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokuliciniso nge-Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **B: Yinhle kakhulu kunekutsi ibe nguleliphuyile.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Namuhla, iTimbuktu lidolobha leliphuyile, kepha lidvumela lalo lilenta libe lidolobha lelitsandza kuvakashelwa tivakashi, futsi linesikhungo setindiza."" This directly translates to ""Today, Timbuktu is a ruined city, but it allows itself to be a city that is loved by visitors and has a center of learning.""

Option B reflects this sentiment of being both ruined *and* loved by visitors.  Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lelidolobha liyafinyeleleka ngendiza** - The passage doesn't mention how it's accessed.
*   **C: Yincane imihlobiso yase-Afrikha kunakulamanye emadolobha lakhelene nayo** - The passage states the opposite: ""Lelidolobha lehlukile kunawo wonkhe emadolobha eveni, ngoba linemoya wesi-Arab kundlula we-Africa.""  This means it has a stronger Arab influence than other African cities.
*   **D: Lelidolobha alisatikhangi tivakashi** - The passage explicitly says it *is* a city loved by visitors.



"
Ekucaleni bekuhlelwe kutsi atoba khona nini ema-Olimpiki asehlobo? ,"The correct answer is **B: Nga-March 2020**.

The text states: ""Uma ngabe ubhadalele indiza nendzawo yekulala kwa-2020 ngaphambi kwekutsi lokuhlehlisa kumunyetelwe..."" This refers to the planned Olympics in **2020** which were postponed.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho lifu lelimise kwefanla liba khona yinkanyamba?","The correct answer is **A: Lapho umoya ufika kumamayela langu-100 ngeli-awa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tenta umoya lomkhulu (ngalokuvamile lohamba 100-200 wemamayela/ngeli-awa) longaphakamisa tintfo letisindzako utiyise emoyeni..."" This directly links the strong winds (100-200 mph) to the lifting of heavy objects, implying that the ""misinga"" (dust/sand) becomes a ""inkanyamba"" (animal/creature) *when* the wind reaches that speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lapho emakholumu emoya acala kutungeleta** (When dust columns start to swirl): While dust columns are *related* to the phenomenon, the passage doesn't specify a turning point for them becoming an ""inkanyamba.""
* **C: Nayisashintja ekubni ngemafu lanesiphepho** (Also changes depending on the shape of the wind): The shape of the wind doesn't define when the ""misinga"" transforms. The wind speed is the key factor.
* **D: Ngemuva kwekufika emhlabatsini** (After arriving at the ground): The passage describes the ""misinga"" starting in the sky and arriving at the ground. It doesn't state that the transformation happens *after* reaching the ground.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungusona mbamba sici senkanyamba?,"The correct answer is **C: Iba ngemafu lamise kwefanela ngemuva kwekufika emhlabatsini.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the movement of wind and how it carries things.** Options A, B, and D all directly relate to this description.
* **Option C, about the ""feathers left behind"" after the wind reaches the ground, is a separate detail not explicitly mentioned in the passage.** The passage doesn't say anything about feathers being left behind.

Therefore, option C is the least likely to be a characteristic mentioned in the passage.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, sivakashi kufanele sisitfole kutsi seluleko mayelana nesimo setepolitiki edolobheni lesiya kulo?","The correct answer is **B: Emibonweni levetwe etelulekweni tetekuhamba**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that travel advisories are based on the political situation in the destination.
* It further explains that travel advisories offer a general idea of the risks, often based on common experiences and comparisons with other locations.
* The passage cautions against solely relying on government advice, as it's intended for its own citizens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuhulumende walelive lesitolivakashela:** While government advice is *part* of the information, the passage doesn't suggest it's the *only* or *best* source. It states government advice is *intended* for its own citizens.
* **C: Kutakamuti takulelive lesitolivakashela:** The passage doesn't mention consulting with local doctors regarding political situations.
* **D: Kuhulumende wakubo:** While it's wise to inform your own government of your travel plans, the question asks where to get *travel advice* about the destination's political situation.



"
"Nakuneteluleko tetekuhamba, yini umuntfu wekuhamba lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi ayitfole?","The correct answer is **D: Kwatiswa lokunemininingwane leminyenti mayelana nesimo setepolitiki talelive (Information is being withheld regarding the political situation of the destination).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travel advisories are often issued based on the political situation of a country.  It further implies that the advisories are sometimes incomplete or don't reflect the full picture. The passage mentions that ""travel advice is only a suggestion for people in that region.""

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Umshuwalensi lomisiwe (Cancelled insurance):** While travel advisories *can* lead to cancelled insurance, the passage focuses more on the *information itself* being incomplete. It doesn't directly state that insurance is routinely cancelled.
*   **B: Tingcikitsi letentiwe taba melula mayelana nesimo setepolitiki talelive (Overly simplified and misleading advice regarding the political situation):** The passage *does* mention that advice can be misleading, however, the most accurate reason for travel advisories is related to withholding crucial information.
*   **C: Kutsintseka kwemshuwalensi wemphilo (Health insurance is affected):** The passage focuses on travel advisories and political situations, not health insurance.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer based on the passage is that information about the political situation is being withheld."
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lweluhamba lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi ludzinge kutsi utfole lusito lwekubhuka enkapanini yekuhamba?","The correct answer is **D: Luhambo lwekucala lwesivakashi loluya kulamanye emave**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that first-time visitors often benefit from tours that are:

* **Focused on nature, culture, language, or budget-friendly options.**  This aligns with the idea of a first-time visitor needing a gentle introduction.
* **Well-organized, as they might be hesitant to navigate complicated travel arrangements.** A tour caters to this need.
* **Often led by experienced guides familiar with the destination.** This helps ease the anxiety of exploring a new place.

Options A and B might be suitable for experienced travelers. Option C might be challenging for someone with limited language skills, especially as a first-time visitor.  Therefore, a tour designed for first-time visitors is the best fit based on the text.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukusiphi simo lapho khona sivakashi sitawuzuza khona kakhulu elusitweni lwenkapani yetekuhamba?","The best answer is **B: Nangabe lesivakashi sinenshisekelo yekubhuka luhambo lolukhetsekile kwekucala.**

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes that frequent travelers benefit most from travel agencies.** The text states: ""Insitakuvakasha imvamiso ikahle kuyikhetsa eluvakashweni lelendlula lwati lwesivakashi mayelana nemvelo, emasiko, lulwimi noma live lelinemali lephansi.""  This implies frequent travelers already understand the benefits and are looking for curated experiences.

* **The text mentions the difficulties of planning complex trips.** ""Ngisho noma bameleli labanyenti banesifiso sekutsatsa labanyenti lababhukile, bameleli labanyenti bagcila kakhulu etindleleni letitsite tekuhamba, sabelomali siyehluka hluka noma tindzawo lokuyiwa kuto.""  This suggests that those wanting unique, complex trips would benefit from a travel agency's expertise.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: Nangabe lesivakashi sibhuka tindiza tekuya nekubuya kuze sivakashele lidolobha laso:** This is a very simple trip and doesn't require the expertise of a travel agency.  Most people can book this themselves.

* **C: Nangabe lesivakashi silukhuluma kahle lulwimi lwemdzabu lwakulendzawo lesiyivakashelako:**  Language skills are helpful, but not the primary reason someone would choose a travel agency.

* **D: Lapho lesivakashi sivakashela indzawo lakunemasiko lehlukile lesiwetayele:** While this type of trip *could* benefit from a travel agency, the text specifically highlights the advantage for *frequent* travelers looking for well-planned experiences.  This is a possible, but less strong, answer.



Therefore, **B** aligns best with the information provided in the text.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengase isite sivakashi sigweme kudvumateka nasivakashele tindzawo letinsha?","The correct answer is **A: Kulindzela lizinga lelifanako nalapho sisuka khona**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that things like customs, laws, food, transportation, standards, and language *differ* at a new place.
* It emphasizes the importance of being aware of these differences to avoid being surprised or feeling lost (""kudvumateka noma kungayitsandzi indlela yasendzaweni yekwenta tintfo"" - to be confused or to miss the way things are done in the area).
* Option A directly reflects this by saying to expect a similar standard to what you are used to.  This implies being prepared for differences but also understanding that some things might be similar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kukulungela kwetama kudla lesingakakwetayeli** (Being prepared for food that you may not like): While being prepared for different food is good, it's not the *main* reason for avoiding being confused about the *entire* experience.
* **C: Kulandzela imitsetfo lefanako neyalapho sisuka khona** (Following the same customs as where you come from): This is the *opposite* of what the text advises. The text says customs will *differ*.
* **D: Kugwema kwenta lucwaningo ngetindzawo tekulala** (Avoiding doing research about lodging): Researching lodging is a good idea, but it doesn't address the broader issue of avoiding cultural misunderstandings and being prepared for differences throughout your visit.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe ekwatisweni lokukulesicephu, luhlobo lolunjani lwemuntfu lolungase ludvumateke naluvakashela endzaweni yangaphandle?","The correct answer is **B: Umuntfu lojabulela lushintjo**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that things at a new location (a site) can be very different from home. It specifically mentions differences in customs, laws, food, transportation, standards, language, and more.

Therefore, someone who *enjoys change* is more likely to be adaptable and less prone to feeling overwhelmed or uncomfortable by these differences. They would be more open to experiencing something new, rather than feeling alienated or confused.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Umuntfu lotsandza kudla lokungakajwayeleki (Someone who likes unusual food):** While trying new foods is part of experiencing a new place, it's only one aspect of cultural adjustment.
*   **C: Umuntfu lonemcondvo lovalekile (Someone with a rigid mindset):** A rigid mindset would actually *increase* the likelihood of feeling uncomfortable and struggling to adapt.
*   **D: Umuntfu lotsandza kufundza (Someone who likes to learn):**  Learning is generally positive, but the passage focuses on *adjusting to a new environment* which goes beyond just acquiring knowledge. While learning *can* help with adaptation, enjoying change is a more direct link to avoiding discomfort.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasiso seluleko lesinconywako kubantfu labavakashela live lelisatfutfuka kwekucala?,"The correct answer is **A: Yati tilwane tasendzaweni ngembi kwekutsi ulale phansi** (Avoid sleeping on the ground).

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns against sleeping on the ground due to the presence of snakes, spiders, and other creatures. Option A directly reflects this warning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gwema kudla kakhulu ngemalanga akho ekucala** (Avoid overeating on your first few days) - The passage advises spending *more* money on nice restaurants, not avoiding food.
*   **C: Kunconywa umbhedze nome ihamokhi nangabe ukhempe ngaphandle** (Camping outdoors is recommended with a bed or hammock) - While the passage *does* mention camping, it does so with the caveat of needing protection from animals. It's not a general recommendation.
*   **D: Tfola lihhotela lelisezingeni lelisetulu nawufika kwekucala** (Get a luxury hotel when you arrive) - The passage advises *not* spending a lot of money on luxury hotels initially.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakabalwa njengentfo longayijabulela nawusetayelana nelive lelisatfutfuka?,"The correct answer is **A: Kudla kwasenshonalanga (Exotic food)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that when traveling to a new and developing region, it's wise to spend more money on ""exotic style and hotels, food, and style-related services.""  It then *specifically* says to **not** scrimp on food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emasevisi lasezingeni lelisetulu (High-end services):** The passage advises *against* being stingy with these, suggesting you should invest in them.
* **C: Matalasi nome sipontji sekukhempa (Camping mattress and sleeping bag):**  The passage suggests taking precautions against animals when camping. This indicates investing in a good sleeping setup is important.
* **D: Emahhotela lasezingeni lelisetulu (High-end hotels):**  The passage advises investing in this.

Therefore, the only option that directly contradicts the passage's advice is to not splurge on exotic food.

"Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungaba ncono kumuntfu lonepholisi lofuna ikhophi lekutebucwepheshe yepholisi yakhe, kodvwa longakhoni kungena ku-inthanethi?","The correct answer is **C: Kugcina ikhophi kungcondvomshini wakhe lophatfwako.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Futsi kuyasita kubanika inchubomgomo nemakhophi ekuchumana bangani labahambako netihlobo noma bangani labasemuva ekhaya. **Kunuvakashile unangcondvomshini lephatfwako noma ithebulethi, gcina ikhophi kumemori yayo noma kudiskhi (letfolakalako ngaphandle kwe-inthanethi).**"" This directly addresses the scenario of someone unable to access the internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuniketa umuntfu lahamba naye ikhophi:** While possible, the text focuses on a situation where internet access is *not* available, making this a less ideal solution than storing it offline on a device.
* **B: Kutitfumelela ikhophi nge-imeyili:** The question states the person can't go online, so emailing a copy is not an option.
* **D: Kugcina ikhophi ku-“cloud”:** The question explicitly mentions the person can't access the internet, and cloud storage requires internet access.

Therefore, storing the copy offline on a device like a phone or tablet is the best solution according to the provided text.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungadzingeki kukhonjiswe kupholisi?","The correct answer is **B: Likheli le-imeyili lenkapani yemshuwalensi**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions needing to provide the *insurance provider's* email address and policy number to apply for a certificate.  It *doesn't* say you need to provide the *insurance company's* email address.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned:

*   **A: Tinombolo telucingo temave emhlaba tekwenta ticelo** - The text explicitly says to provide the policy number for the application.
*   **C: Tinombolo telucingo temave emhlaba tekugunyata** - This refers to the claim number, which is mentioned as needed.
*   **D: Likheli le-imeyili lemnikati wepholisi** - The text indicates that it is necessary to have the insurance provider's email address.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi isayizi leveta ifomathi yelifilimu lesetjentiswa kakhulu?","The correct answer is **D: I-36 x 24 mm negative**.

The passage states that the commonly used film format in the past was 35mm (36 x 24). The question asks about the *most commonly used* format, and 35mm is explicitly mentioned as a standard. While other formats are mentioned (6x6, 56x56), 35mm is highlighted as the ""vanilla"" or common format.
"
Nguyiphi kulamafomathi elifilimu lalandzelako leniketa kukhanya lokufana nekwe-DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Lifilimu lelingu-35 mm**.

Here's why:

* The question asks which film format is closest to the light-gathering ability of a DSLR.
* The passage states that 35mm film (36x24mm) is commonly used and can be adapted to modern DSLRs.
* The passage also indicates that the 6x6 film format is significantly larger (4x as big) than 35mm.  While larger, it doesn't necessarily mean better light gathering; it just means a larger image.
* The other options are either not as common for modern use (linefomathi lesemkhatsini, 6x6 cm film) or are demonstrably less capable of gathering light compared to a DSLR sensor.

Therefore, 35mm film is the most comparable option in terms of light-gathering capability to a DSLR sensor, especially considering the adaptability mentioned in the text.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokungaba sinyatselo sekugcina sekucala ibhizinisi yekubhala ngeteluhambo?","The correct answer is **C: Kwakha iwebusayithi yakho (Create your own website)**.

Here's why:

The prompt states that the initial task is to practice writing travel content and learn formatting.  The ultimate goal mentioned is to eventually build your own website.  The other options are steps *towards* that goal, but building the website is the final, overarching aim discussed in the context.



*   **A: Kuphrakthiza kufomatha ku-inthanethi (Practice online formatting)** is a step involved but not the final outcome.
*   **B: Kubhala tihloko letinyenti tewebusayithi yetekuhamba lehlonishwako (Write high-quality articles for a respected travel website)** is valuable for experience, but not the end goal of having your own platform.
*   **D: Kutfutfukisa emakhono akho ekulungisa lokubhaliwe (Develop your writing skills)** is crucial but a means to an end, not the end itself.



"
"Nawucalisa ibhizinisi yakho yekubhala ngetekuhamba, ngumaphi kulamakhono lalandzelako lokungase kudzingeke uwatfutfukise kucala?","The best answer is **D: Kwakha iwebusayithi (Build a website)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about starting a writing business.**  To start a writing business *especially* one focused on travel blogging and building a portfolio, you *need* a website to showcase your work.
* **A website is the platform for showcasing your writing.** Options A, B, and C are all related to the *content* of the website (writing, editing, proofreading), but they don't address the fundamental need to *have* a website in the first place.  You need to build the foundation to display your skills.

Therefore, building a website is the most crucial initial skill when starting a travel writing business online.



"
Kukuluphi luhlobo lwesimo selitulu lapho tinkinga tematfumbu tivame kutfolakala khona?,"The correct answer is **C: Lapho kushisa khona (Where it's hot)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kutindzaweni letishisako ligciwane landza ngekushesha futsi liphile sikhatsi lesidze nalingephandle kwemtimba."" (In hot places, germs spread quickly and can survive outside the body for a long time.)  This directly links the prevalence of intestinal problems to hot environments.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kuchayeka njalo kungabangela kuvikeleka kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Etinkingeni tematfumbu (In the intestines)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Ekhaya, ngenca yekuchayeka njalo emagciwaneni asendzaweni, manengi ematfuba ekutsi ugcine umtimba wakho sewukhona kulwa nawo.""  This translates to ""At home, because of frequent contamination in food, there are many opportunities to keep your body vulnerable to fighting them off.""  The passage then goes on to discuss illnesses like Delhi Belly and Montezuma's Revenge, all of which are intestinal infections.

Therefore, the answer refers to the intestines, which is where these types of infections occur. The other options are incorrect because while the passage mentions infections in the respiratory system and skin, the primary concern discussed is intestinal contamination and the resulting illnesses.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokubuhle bekuvakasha endzaweni ye-Schengen?,"The correct answer is **A: Kugwema ticelo letinyenti tema-visa**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that the Schengen area functions similarly to a single country regarding visa requirements. 
* It explicitly mentions that while a Schengen visa isn't required for short stays *within* the area, applying for visas for individual countries *within* the Schengen zone can be avoided.
* While options B and C might be *benefits* of the Schengen system, they are not the *primary* or overarching advantage discussed in the text.
* Option D is incorrect; a passport is still required.

Therefore, the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text is that the beauty of visiting the Schengen area is avoiding the need for multiple visa applications."
Yini lengeke isatfolakala ethuneni la-Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Umcebo (The sarcophagus)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Imicebo lemangalisako yalelithuna ayisekho kilo, kepha yasuswa yamikiswa eMsamo weGibhithe eCairo."" This translates to ""The amazing sarcophagus of this tomb is missing, but it was removed and placed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.""  Therefore, the sarcophagus was *not* found in the tomb, but rather removed and moved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Leminye imihlobiso (Other decorations):** The text mentions that the tomb has decorations and that the sarcophagus is missing, suggesting there *are* decorations.
* **B: Inhloko yemufi (The head of the mummy):** The text says the head and shoulders are visible.
* **C: Lihlombe lemufi (The shoulders of the mummy):** The text says the head and shoulders are visible.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi indzawo yaseVancouver lengakhanga kancane bantfu labakhatsateke kakhulu ngemali? ","The correct answer is **C: I-Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island is a good option for a day trip or weekend getaway that's ""not too expensive.""
* The passage mentions Vancouver and Granville Island as a departure point for the ferry to Bowen Island, but doesn't specify anything about its cost.
* Sea to Sky refers to the general area connecting Vancouver to Whistler, so it's not a specific place to choose.
* Whistler is described as being ""quite expensive"" due to its popularity as a ski resort and the 2010 Olympics.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi indzawo lokunematfuba lamakhulu ekutsi yente tivakashi tijabulele i-Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: I-Bowen Island**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sichingi i-Bowen luhamba lwelusuku noma kuvakasha kwemphelasontfo lokudvume ngekuniketa i-kayaking, kucanca tindzawo temvelo... Lommango useHowe Sound nawuphuma nje eVancouver, futsi kungeneka kalula kuwo nawuhamba ngemkhumbi losuka eGranville Island eVancouver."" This highlights Bowen Island as a key destination for day trips and nature lovers from Vancouver.

While Whistler and Granville Island are mentioned, Bowen Island is presented as the primary focus for outdoor activities and a relaxing escape. Vancouver itself is the city, not a specific destination within it.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho khona tivakashi kufanele tivakashele Timphophoma natifuna kubuka kahle ngaphandle kwekusitseka?","The correct answer is **A: Nga-November kuya ku-March**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngesikhatsi setimvula (ngaNovember kuya kuMarch), lizinga lemanti litawukhula kakhulu neTimphophoma titawuba nemanti lamanyenti."" This directly indicates that tourists should visit between November and March to see the falls at their fullest and most impressive."
"Ngekwalesicephu, buyini buhle bekuvakashela i-Victoria Fall emkhatsini wa-November na-March?","The correct answer is **A: Kubuka Imphophoma ngaphandle kwekusitseka**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ngesikhatsi setimvula (ngaNovember kuya kuMarch), lizinga lemanti litawukhula kakhulu neTimphophoma titawuba nemanti lamanyenti. Utawuba manti nakanjani nawewela kulelibhuloho noma nawuhamba endleleni leseceleni kwaleMphophoma."" This means that during November to March (the rainy season), the falls are at their most powerful and impressive, but also create a lot of mist. To truly *see* the falls without being obscured by the mist, you'd want to visit during this time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kunetivakashi letincane:** The text doesn't mention the number of tourists being small. In fact, it says the falls are a ""ndzawo ledvumile ledvonsa tivakashi letinyenti"" (a popular place that attracts many tourists).
* **C: Kumangalisa kwemphophoma:** While the falls *are* amazing, the text focuses on *how* they are amazing - especially during the rainy season.
* **D: Kugwema sikhatsi setimvula:** The question asks about visiting *during* November to March, which is the rainy season. This option is the opposite of what the text is highlighting.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokunganconywa nawusebentisa idroni nawushutha lifilimu?","The correct answer is **C: Kwenta lucwaningo mayelana netimvume (Conduct research on permits)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of knowing what is and isn't allowed.** It specifically mentions the risk of violating regulations.
* **Option C directly addresses this by suggesting research into permits.**  Many locations require permits for drone operation, and knowing this beforehand is crucial to avoid legal trouble.
* **Option A (Kuhlola kusengaphambili loko lovumeleke kukushutha - Check beforehand what is permitted to shoot)** is a good first step, but research into *permits* is a deeper level of understanding needed.
* **Option B (Kutfola timvume letengetiwe - Obtain required permits)** is also important, but it follows the research phase. You need to know *what* permits are needed before you can obtain them.
* **Option D (Kushutha kuphela etindzaweni letigcwele bantfu lapho idroni ingeke inakeke khona - Shoot only in crowded places where the drone cannot be damaged)** is **incorrect and dangerous**.  Shooting near crowds is discouraged for many reasons (safety, privacy), but it doesn't address the legal aspect of permits.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngutiphi tindzawo letincono kutsi ungashutha ngedroni?","The correct answer is **D: Etindzaweni lapho utfole khona timvume kusengaphambili.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of checking regulations and permissions.** It specifically states, ""...ungacabangi nekucabanga kutfwebula ivideo yako. Ngewesif unobumeleki, ungacabanga kutfwebula ivideo yako."" (Don't even think about filming your video.  With permission, you can think about filming your video.)
* **Option D directly reflects this point.** It highlights the need to obtain the necessary permits and approvals *before* flying a drone.
* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** While avoiding crowds is good practice, it doesn't address the legal aspect of drone operation.
    * **B:** Flying in restricted areas is illegal, not a recommended filming location.
    * **C:**  While less populated areas are safer, it doesn't address the legal requirement for permission.



Therefore, getting permission beforehand is the best way to ensure legal and ethical drone filming.

* The text states: ""Emaveni lamanyenti lanalomtsetfo lofana nalona, emahhotela endzawo atawenta lokubhalisa (ciniseka kutsi uyabuta). Kuletinye timo, ngulabo kuphela labangahlali etindzaweni tebantfu labavakashile lokudzingeka kutsi babhaliswe.""  This means that if you're staying at a hotel, they might handle the registration.  The key point is that *not everyone* needs to register.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Onkhe emave adzinga kutsi ubhalise netiphatsimandla tendzawo:** The text explicitly contradicts this. It says it's *not* a universal requirement.
* **C: Kungase kudzingeke uye emahhovisi etekungena kwebantfu:** While registration *could* involve going to immigration offices in some cases, it's not stated as a general requirement.
* **D: Kuletinye tindzawo, emahhotela endzawo ayabhalisa:** While some hotels might register, the text says this is only in *certain* places, not universally.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the text."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasiyo indzawo lapho tivakashi tingase tiye khona kuze tiyobhalisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Esiteshini semaphoyisa endzaweni (Police station in the area)**.

Here's why:

The text states that in many places, you need to register at the hotel where you are staying. While you *might* need to go to the police station in some situations, the text emphasizes that hotels often handle the registration process. It doesn't say that the police station is a standard place for tourists to register.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ehhotela letihlala kulo (Hotel where you are staying):**  The text *explicitly* says this is a common place to register.
* **C: Ehhovisi leliposli endzaweni (Post office in the area):** The text doesn't mention the post office as a registration location.
* **D: Emahhovisi etekungena kwebantfu (Immigration offices):** While immigration might be involved in some cases, the text doesn't say tourists register there.  The text focuses on local registration requirements.

Ngubani longeke azuze ngekuvolontiya nakaseluhambeni?,"The correct answer is **C: Umuntfu lonelitsemba lekutfola likhono lelisha.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that volunteering allows you to ""utfole emakhono lamasha"" (learn new skills). 
* While other options might be *potential* benefits, the text focuses on skill development as a key advantage.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Umuntfu lonelitsemba lekwakha bangani nakakulamanye emave** (Someone who wants to make friends and meet new people) - While this *is* a benefit, it's not the central point the text emphasizes.
* **B: Umuntfu lofuna liholo lelikhulu** (Someone who wants a high position) - Volunteering doesn't typically lead to a high position.
* **D: Umuntfu longase abe nenshisekelo yendzawo yekulala nekudla** (Someone who might be interested in a lodging and food service) -  This is a secondary benefit mentioned regarding the opportunity to earn money, but not the main focus of the text about volunteering itself.

The text explicitly states: ""...kungase futsi kube yindlela lekahle yekwadzisa sabelomali kuze kuvunyelwe kuhlala sikhatsi lesidze endzaweni letsite njengobe leminyenti imisebenti yekuba livolontiya utfola indlu yekuhlala nekudla futsi labambalwa babhadala imali lencane."" This means volunteers are often provided with food and accommodation in exchange for their work.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Cishe liholo lihlale likhona:** While volunteering can be a fulfilling experience, it's not guaranteed to be a lifelong commitment.
* **B: Ngalokuvamile kuholela ematfubeni emsebenti:**  Volunteering might lead to job opportunities *eventually*, but it's not the primary or common outcome. The text doesn't focus on job prospects.
* **D: Kungakusita kutsi utive unembono:** While gaining perspective is a benefit of volunteering, it's not the main financial reward described in the text.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengase itsatfwe njengaleyetayelekile eluhambeni loluvamile loluya e-Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Kucitsa sonkhe sikhatsi kuloluhambo usendzaweni ye-Disney.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""...bese kubuywa ekhaya. Ahlukene futsi angachazwa ngetindlela letehlukene kodvutsi bantfu labasuke bakusho nabatsi """"baya kuDisney World."""" **Kucitsa sonkhe sikhatsi kuloluhambo usendzaweni ye-Disney.**"" This directly describes a common element of a typical Disney World trip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kucitsa liviki ubuka ipaki:** While visiting the parks is a key part of the trip, the text mentions other elements like staying at a hotel and the travel to and from the airport.  It doesn't emphasize park visits as the *defining* aspect.
* **B: Kuhlala ehhotela lelingekho endzaweni:** The text states that you *stay* at a hotel *within* the Disney property.
* **D: Kutsatsa ibhasi kusuka esikhumulweni setindiza kuya ehhotela:** The text doesn't mention anything about buses or transportation methods.



"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana ne-Walt Disney World?,"The correct answer is **B: Tindzawo tekulala tiyatfolakala khona**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...kuhamba kuyiwe ehhotela lase Disney..."" This confirms that accommodations are available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emathikithi e-park-hopper ayendluliseleka kuletinye tivakashi:** The text says ""Ngisho lona kungumdlalo lovamile, awukavunyelwa nguDisney: nemathikithi awo angeke uwendlulisele kulomunye."" This implies park hopper tickets *cannot* be shared.
* **C: Kunemabhasi latfolakalako kuze atsatse tivakashi kuzuka esikhumulweni setindiza kuya kulendzawo:** The text doesn't mention buses for transportation.
* **D: Emathikithi emalanga lamanyenti angatfolakala kumawebusayithi endali:** The text says tickets are sold online through official websites like Undercover or Craigslist, but it *doesn't* say they can be found on unofficial websites.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuletinkinga letilandzelako lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi kungentiwa eklasini lekucecesha lelicwepheshile nome kulokushicilelwe?","The best answer is **A: Kusindza ehlane**. 

Here's why:

The text describes a military investigation process that typically takes 2-5 days and includes assessing the damage, initial findings, and a physical examination. The question asks what the *next* issue might be after this initial phase, leading to a more professional investigation or publication. 

* **A: Kusindza ehlane (Four days of investigation)** aligns directly with the timeline mentioned in the text.  After the initial 2-5 days, the process would likely continue with deeper investigation.
* **B: Kulungela lusito lwekucala (Ready for the initial findings)** is a step *within* the initial 2-5 day period, not what follows.
* **C: Kulungela indzawo lenemphi (Ready for the military base)** is not directly mentioned as a subsequent step in the investigation.
* **D: Kudlala indzima (Playing with the weight)** refers to the physical examination and isn't a subsequent issue in the investigation process.



Therefore, the most logical continuation of the process described is a deeper investigation, which would take further time - specifically, four days in this context.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngutiphi kuletihloko letilandzelako lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi tentiwe eklasini lekucecesha lokucwepheshile?","The correct answer is **A: Lusito lwekucala**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sifundvo lesifundvwako ngalokuvamile sihlanganisa konkhe loku lesesikhulume ngako lapha kodvwa kufundvwe kabanti, ngalokuvamile kusetjentiswa sipiliyoni lesisebentako. Sifundvo lesifundvwako ngalokuvamile singatsatsa emalanga langu-2-5 futsi sihlanganise indzima ledlalwako, **lusito lwekucala**...""

This directly links the initial assessment (lusito lwekucala) to the investigation process described in the text.  The other options are mentioned as topics related to military studies but aren't specifically stated as part of the initial assessment phase.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumuphi umbono loncono wekugwema emanti lokungenteka angcolile?","The correct answer is **B: Tsenga emanti lasemabhodleleni**.

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes the importance of buying bottled water from reputable companies, especially when dealing with water that might be unsafe.
* It mentions that different filtration methods exist, but the passage *specifically* recommends buying bottled water as a safer option.
* While the passage mentions different drinking times, the core recommendation for avoiding contaminated water is to use a safe source – bottled water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bilisa emanti imizuzu lembalwa:** The passage says that some water may be safe after a short boiling time, while others need longer. It doesn't make this the *best* way to *avoid* contaminated water.
* **C: Bilisa emanti umzuzu lowodwa:** This is too short a time to effectively kill harmful bacteria and viruses.
* **D: Hlola emanti kuze utfole tingoti letitsite:**  The passage doesn't mention testing water for impurities as a primary way to avoid contaminated water. While testing is important, buying bottled water from a trusted source is presented as the immediate, safer solution.



"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengase ingenteki ngisho nakubabhukushi labanelikhono?","The correct answer is **B: Kubhukusha emantini lashonako**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how sharks are drawn back to the area where a surfer has been bitten.  The key phrase is: ""Ngemphumela yekukhatsala kutama kubuyela emuva ubhukusha..."" (As a result of the blood, sharks return...).  Therefore, sharks are attracted to blood in the water.

* **B: Kubhukusha emantini lashonako (Sharks are attracted to blood in the water):** This directly aligns with the passage's explanation.
* **A: Kubhukusha edvute nematje (Sharks are attracted to dark, bloody flesh):** While related, the passage focuses on the blood *in the water*, not the visual appearance of the flesh.
* **C: Kubhukusha uphambane nemsinga wemanti (Sharks are attracted to the front and edge of the water):** The passage doesn't mention sharks being attracted to the edge of the water.
* **D: Kubhukusha utungelete emagagasi (Sharks are attracted to churning water):**  The passage doesn't mention turbulence specifically attracting sharks.



"
Yini lokufanele uyente nawubanjwa ngumsinga?,"The passage describes a situation where a shark attacks someone in the water and then retreats to the depths. It emphasizes the speed of the shark's retreat and the importance of reacting quickly. It also suggests trying to reach an area where the shark can't reach you and using your skills to defend yourself if seen.

Based on this information, the best answer to the question ""What should you do if you are grabbed by a shark?"" is:

**B: Bhukusha ngekushesha uphambane nemsinga** (Swim quickly away from the shark).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the speed of the shark's retreat.**  Getting away quickly is crucial.
* **Reaching a safe area is important (mentioned in the passage).** Swimming away helps achieve this.
* **The other options are less effective:**
    * **A:**  This describes what the shark does, not what the person should do.
    * **C:**  Looking in another direction won't help you escape the shark.
    * **D:**  Going underwater might temporarily avoid the shark, but it doesn't address getting away and could put you in a more vulnerable position.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and effective response according to the information provided."
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukuyiphi indzawo lapho kuvakashela ikhaseli kungase kube yintfo lemnandzi kuyenta nawuseholidini?","The correct answer is **C: E-Rhine Valley**.

The passage specifically mentions visiting the Loire Valley chateaux, Rhine Valley chateaux, and castles along the Danube. Therefore, the Rhine Valley is the best answer.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kunconywe kulabasikati labavakashele lendzawo?","The correct answer is **B: Caphela kutsi kuhluka kwemasiko kungase kubangele bantfu bendzawo kutsi balwe (Beware that cultural differences may lead to locals becoming offended)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that it's considered impolite for women to be seen holding hands, being touched, or having a man escort them.  It also mentions that women should avoid things that might be seen as disrespectful or overly revealing.  Option B directly addresses this cultural sensitivity, warning against actions that could be perceived as offensive due to differing cultural norms.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Gwema kucoca ngesimo sekulwa (Avoid talking about the state of conflict):** While potentially wise to be sensitive about conflict in the Sahel region, it's not the *most* directly relevant point based on the text's emphasis on gender and cultural interactions.
* **C: Gwema kugcoka bucwebe lobukhatitelako (Avoid wearing revealing or tight clothing):** This is related to cultural sensitivity, but the text highlights more than just clothing.
* **D: Cina nangabe kudzingekile (Carry a weapon if necessary):** The text focuses on social interactions and cultural norms, not personal safety measures. While safety is always important, it's not directly addressed within the context of the provided excerpt.



"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzaweni lechazwe kulesicephu, yini lengase inconyelwe kulabasikati labavakashako?","The correct answer is **A: Bona kutsi akukavami kulandzelwa.**

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the importance of women and travelers being perceived as *not* being overly affectionate or physically intimate in public. It specifically mentions avoiding things that might be seen as ""unusual"" or ""not commonly followed"" by local men.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gwema kugcoka indandatho lenkhulu kukhombisa simo sekulwa:** This is not directly addressed in the text.
*   **C: Condza kutsi kwehluka kwemasiko kusho kumelela indzawo yakho:** While cultural sensitivity is important, the text isn't focused on using cultural differences to *represent* one's origin. It's focused on *adapting* to the local customs.
*   **D: Endzabeni yekufunwa, cina ekwaleni emadvodza:** This is not mentioned in the text and, frankly, sounds like inappropriate advice.

Therefore, the best answer is **A**, as it directly reflects the text's emphasis on avoiding behavior that is perceived as uncommon or unusual."
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngusiphi simo lesidzinga umtsebuli wetitfombe kutsi asebentise ilensi lekhetsekile?","The correct answer is **A: Nawufuna kushutha tilwanyana letincane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nawushutha tilwane tasendle ngalokuvamile udzinga ilensi lendze, nakuba tintfo letinjengemhlambi wetinyoni noma tilokatana letincane tidzinga lamanye emalensi.""  This directly links shooting small animals to needing specialized lenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nangabe letitfombe tisetjentiselwa tinjongo tekutsengisa:** While there might be restrictions on photographing animals for profit, the passage doesn't connect this specifically to needing a specialized lens.
* **C: Nangabe letilwane letishuthwako tinemahloni:** The passage mentions that animals with horns can be dangerous, but this doesn't necessitate a specific lens.
* **D: Nangabe ipaki inemitsetfo lekhetsekile mayelana netitfombe tetilwane:** Restrictions on photography in parks don't directly dictate the type of lens needed.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengenkinga lengahle ibe kona kubatsebuli betitfombe?,"The correct answer is **D: Kusebenta etindzaweni letingase tibe nebungoti**.

Here's why:

* The passage mentions that some animals are difficult to find and that there might be restrictions on photographing them in certain areas. 
* Option D directly addresses the potential danger of working in locations that could be unsafe. This isn't explicitly stated as a problem but is strongly implied by the mention of restrictions and the potential for difficult-to-find animals.
* Options A, B, and C are mentioned directly in the passage as challenges faced by wildlife photographers.



Therefore, the unstated problem is the potential danger of the environment where the photography takes place.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungase kubangele tinkinga letincane kumshayeli lohamba etindzaweni tetintsaba?,"The correct answer is **D: Kungaboni kahle (Can't see well)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how rain, hail, and fog can reduce visibility, especially when combined with strong winds.  This directly leads to the problem of being unable to see clearly while driving, which is a significant hazard on roads.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Siminyaminya setimoti (Car vibrations):** While vibrations can be uncomfortable, they aren't a primary safety concern related to weather conditions in the described scenario.
* **B: Kushayisana lokuphansi (Hydroplaning):** Hydroplaning is a risk in wet conditions, but the passage focuses more on visibility issues.
* **C: Kushintja kwegesi ibe ngemanti (Gas turning into water):**  This is a separate issue related to fuel systems and not directly connected to the weather conditions described.



Therefore, the most direct consequence of rain, hail, and fog (as described) is reduced visibility, making option D the correct answer.



"
Yini lengase ihlale ingashintji mayelana nemtselo longena emaveni lehlukehlukene?,"The correct answer is **A: Emanani (Amounts)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Umtselo ubalwa ngetindlela letingafani emaveni lahlukene, linani lemtselo liyehlukana kulelinye live nakuchatsaniswa nalelinye."" This translates to: ""The duty is calculated in different ways in different countries, the amount of duty varies from one country to another and is combined with another.""  This directly points to the *amount* of duty being the variable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kwakheka (Composition/Nature):** The composition of the goods being taxed is generally consistent across countries (e.g., a certain percentage of alcohol).  The text focuses on how *much* is charged, not what *is* charged.
* **C: Lapho ufaka khona (Where you import it):**  The country of import *is* a defining factor in the *amount* of duty, but the question asks what *stays the same*.  While the country of import is consistent, the *amount* charged varies.
* **D: Emazinga (Levels):** While levels of taxation *exist*, the question asks what *doesn't change*.  The amount is what changes, not the fundamental levels of taxation themselves.

Therefore, the amount of duty is the most consistent aspect, even if it varies greatly across countries.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nawusebenta kulamanye emave kodvwa uhlala kulenye indzawo, kukuphi lapho kungenteka ufaka khona umtselo wakho wemali lenganako?","The correct answer is **A: Lapho uhlala khona sikhatsi lesinyenti (Where you live most of the time)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in many countries, you need to pay taxes where you *live* most of the time, not necessarily where you work. Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E-United States (In the United States):** While the US has a strong tax system, the passage emphasizes that taxes are often tied to where you *reside*.
* **C: Eveni lapho usebentela khona (In the country where you work):**  The passage explicitly mentions that this is *not* always the case.  Taxes are often tied to residency, not just employment.
* **D: Nome ngukuphi lapho imali iphansi khona (Or anywhere where the money is low):** This is irrelevant to the tax system.  The amount of money you earn doesn't determine where you pay taxes.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the passage.
"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langayichazi kahle i-World Fair?,"The correct answer is **D: Emave akudzingeki abe yincenye (Past events are not necessarily a part)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngisho noma ngekwaloko lokubhaliwe loku kufanele kwenteke njalo ngemnyaka (nangabe basahlala emaveni lehlukene), nasikhuluma ngaloko lokwenteka mbamba loku akwenteki.""  This translates to: ""Even though it is written that it should always take place annually (even if it takes place in different locations), we talk about what happened in the past.""

This means that while past events are *discussed*, they aren't *necessarily* a part of the current World's Fair. The focus is on the present and future.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Imibukiso ingase ibonise umlandvo nome emasiko elive (Exhibitions may showcase culture and lifestyle):** The passage states this directly: ""I-International Horticultural Expositions ngimibutsano lekhetsekile yekukhangisa tintfo tasengadzeni nanoma yini lenye lehambelana netitjalo."" (International Horticultural Exhibitions are special gatherings to showcase things related to plants.) and ""Imibukiso ingase ibonise umlandvo nome emasiko elive"" (Exhibitions may showcase culture and lifestyle).
*   **B: Imibukiso yetitjalo ikhonjiswa edvute nemibukiso yemasiko neyekufundzisa (Plant exhibitions are showcased in the past and cultural/educational exhibitions):** The passage discusses plant exhibitions in the past and also mentions cultural and educational exhibitions as part of the fair.
*   **C: Imicimbi ingafinyelela etinyangeni letingafika kuletisitfupha (Events can last for months):**  The passage says: ""Imicimbi ingafinyelela etinyangeni letingafika kuletisitfupha"" (Events can last for months).

Therefore, the only incorrect option is D.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungumtsetfo we-World’s Fair nome i-International Exposition?,"The correct answer is **A: Imibukiso kufanele ikhombise kokubili emasiko elive netinkinga temhlaba.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Emave latsatsa incenye abonakalisa buciko nemfundvo etindzaweni temphakatsi tesive kubonisa inkinga yemhlaba wonkhe nobe lisiko nemlandvo welive labo.""  This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Live lelifanako ngeke libambe lemicimbi minyaka yonkhe:** The passage mentions that while it *should* happen annually, it doesn't always. So, the statement that it *never* happens annually is false.
* **C: Lemicimbi kufanele itsatse sikhatsi lesifika etinyangeni letisitfupha:** The passage says it typically lasts from several months to a couple of years, not just six months.
* **D: Kuze lombukiso ubanjwe, onkhe emave kufanele ahlanganyele:** The passage doesn't mention that everyone needs to participate before the exhibition is held.



"
Kwenta kuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungehlusa ematfuba ekuhlaselwa silwane?,"The correct answer is **C: Kugcina libanga lelingemayadi langu-25 kusuka etimphisini.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Noma kungabonakala kutfobeke kangakanani, inyatsi, indololwane, imoose, libhele, futsi cishe tonkhe tilwane letinkhulu tingahlasela. Ngako-ke gwema kuphatsa noma kupheka kudla lokunukelelako futsi ugcine likamu lihlobile."" This reinforces the need to maintain a safe distance.
* The passage also mentions needing a 100-meter buffer zone around enclosures and a 25-meter buffer zone around other animals. 
* Option C directly addresses this safe distance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuphatsa emakhambi lanemakha:** This is not mentioned in the passage as a preventative measure against animal attacks.
* **B: Kususa idoti endzaweni yekukhempa:** While good camping practice, the passage doesn't link removing trash directly to preventing animal attacks. The emphasis is on food odors.
* **D: Kuvimbela tilwane ngetinsalela tekudla:** This is related to the food odor aspect, but option C is a more direct and specific preventative measure mentioned in the passage.



"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengalokungase kube yimbangela yekuhlaselwa silwane?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwehluleka kugcina libanga (Failing to secure the area)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of maintaining a safe distance from animals and securing areas where animals are kept.  The text explicitly states, ""Noma kungabonakala kutfobeke kangakanani, inyatsi, indololwane, imoose, libhele, futsi cishe tonkhe tilwane letinkhulu tingahlasela.""  This implies that a lack of secure boundaries is a significant contributing factor to attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Liphunga lelinemandla (Strong scent):** While the passage mentions avoiding strong smells by storing food properly, it doesn't frame strong scents as a primary *cause* of attacks. It's more about attracting animals.
*   **C: Kunika tilwane tasendle kudla (Feeding wild animals):** The passage explicitly warns against feeding wild animals. This is definitely a contributing factor, but the broader issue of *securing the area* is more fundamental.
*   **D: Tilwane letingakabetayeli bantfu (Animals that don't bite people):** The passage states that *many* animals can attack, regardless of whether they typically bite. It focuses on the potential for harm, not on which animals are inherently harmless.



Therefore, **B: Kwehluleka kugcina libanga** is the best answer as it directly reflects the core message of the passage about avoiding encounters with animals by ensuring secure boundaries."
